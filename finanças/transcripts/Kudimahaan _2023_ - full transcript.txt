Hey...get lost. Hey, pity on it. Hey, apply the password. Hello...Hello... Oh, no! Is it hurting more? Why can't you be careful? I said about the cooking. Had I been with you, I'd have healed it. Instead of talking to a human, talking with you is far better. In fact you don't have a father or a wife like me. -Yes, it's there, about four to five. If the wife manages with what is given and stay quiet, then it will be very nice, right? Brother, why are you blabbering alone? Hey, I'm unable to live with a single wife. How come you're able to manage a couple of women at same time? Look we have option of using two sim cards and some people use two cell phones, isn't it! Then, why not we enjoy in life, brother? Don't irritate me further. Leave. You people go out, roam around happily. Are we happy? Touch my dicky, you will know. He said about van dicky. Why? He is sitting happily in a.c room, we're going out taking risk, he is irritating us. Hey, I'll go give the report to the manager and come. Wait, we'll leave together. Okay, brother. Take your seat. Sit down, Madhi. It's okay, sir. Please have it, eat. How many ATMs did you cover today? Sir, twenty eight. Twenty eight! Excellent. Give me that. Give me the photo. Here it is, sir. Come here... Come here... You can't even properly take a photograph. For past eight years, what the hell are you doing here? Just only this photo... Just only one photo, right? From your salary if just one... One thousand is reduced, will you agree? Sir, that is... Sorry sir. You're doing something to prove that you people are not to be trusted. You'll say sorry and leave, I have to answer all the bankers. What? Is this hot enough... Shall I pour on me and tell you? Okay. Sorry, sir. Get out! All of you get out. Cool...cool...calm.. chill...chill Sir! What? My phone! -Get lost. Cool...cool...calm.. chill...chill Mom, he will waste the water. Let him do whatever, you better write. -Mom, come and clean up. Cooking for your dad and cleaning up for you will shorten my life. Wait, I'm coming. Daddy! Hey, already I have stomach ache. Sorry...sorry... Buy me a pizza, daddy. I'll buy you, okay? Daddy! Hey, why do you also bump on my stomach, it's painful. Dad, are you going to pee? Go, wear your trousers. Daddy, Pizza...Pizza... I'll buy you, let me go refresh and come. Pavi, take care of them. Wear your trousers. -Stomach ache! Everyday you eat out and complain about stomach ache. Daddy please, buy us a pizza. -Unable to resist eating. My fate, I got married to you. P-O-U-S-T-M-R. We are going to hold a massive protest against rise in liquor prices. Drinking is wrong and wonder they have an association too. It's great of them to study, what is the need to watch TV? Children who excel in studies will study at any situation. What is this? "Zebra" You said correctly. Hey, open the door. I have to do everything. "Stay blessed" Go. Thank you, grandpa. Take it. -Thank you, grandpa. What is the need to eat immediately, better write properly. What kind of handwriting is this? Is handwriting important? Health is more important. Uncle, are you talking care of your health? I'm perfectly fine, I'm an iron man. Uncle! What happened? Grandpa! -Dad! Grandpa! Uncle! Dad, what happened? Grandpa! Uncle! It's said, blood is thicker than water. My dear family, all of you were panicked. Uncle, why do you drink everyday and come home? Had mother-in-law been alive would you do like this? If she is alive, she'd make me an omelette. I'd have saved more money not spending on side dish. Hey, sit down. -But she passed away! Can you get an omlette for me? ♪Oh, man!

He had pissed a thousand times. Hey, I told you just now. Sorry...sorry... I'm asking for a new mattress for years together but it's futile. Hey, lie down. Do I wish to sleep on this musty mattress? Good times will come, let's buy then. You're expecting good time for years together. Have it. Move away. Take your leg. A ghost is coming... Hey, it won't come when your mom is here.

Move away, kids. What to do? Step slowly. Why do you keep screaming, dad? Sit. -Sit on this... Dad, let the vessel be safe. It might damage. Dad! Dad! Oh, no! Have water. Take it and drink, dad. Shouldn't you step carefully? I'll bang your head. Why am I going to fall if I was careful? Dear, take uncle to the hospital. Hey, it's getting late to office. What, dear! Is the office more important to you than me? What to do? You suddenly fell down. Hey, Sundar's dad fell in a ditch. -What? He fell suddenly in a ditch. Bring the auto soon. Why are you wantedly saying I fell in ditch? Hey, what happened? Sundar's dad fell in ditch. Hey, Sundaram's dad was drunk and fell in ditch it seems. Just tolerate for a while, please. Someone is showing mercy on me but he is not bothered. Someone? Do you know about my birth? Oh, no! I said in a flow. I'm in terrible pain. I will change my attire and come. There is no time for it, come dad. I'll change the shirt atleast. Get on. The auto is waiting. Be careful, uncle. Go safe, uncle. Call after reaching, okay? Hey, jolly! It's a holiday today! Does it stink? Don't irritate me. I'm feared what the manager will say. Sundaram. Sundaram, come. You go, I'll have tea and come later. Get me perfume also. Sorry, sir. He will be furious only on me. Saravanan, handle the manager. I'll come soon. It's stinking. It's okay, why to bother? How did it happen? I thought of beautifying our area like Goa. But they pushed me into drainage. Social service. Oh, okay. You take off your shirt. Let me tie a bandage. Madhi, let's go home as soon as the doctor visits. I sense something fetid. It seems to be a routine one. Someone has come drunk. I'm dubious on a guy. Hey Madhi, your favorite song is playing. Hey, sit here and watch. Why are you going there? Oh, sinner! Have you drunk? I didn't, it's you who was drunk. Hey, how dare you watch porn being hospitalised? No, I'm not. I did by mistake. Did you do by mistake? Okay...okay...stay good. Come... My hand...my hand... You've redeemed, right? Then, we are friends. Why are you stretching your finger instead of hand? Sorry, bro. I'll take this glucose. Altogether are holding me. Am I highly inebriated? Hey, excellent! Who is he, sir? He is inebriated and creating ruckus. Call the cop. Oh, no! Mam, he is my son. Don't know where he went and boozed. Forgive him for my sake. Hey, leave me. Such a bad son for you? Such a bad son for you? Sorry. Hey, throw the ball. Oh, gosh! This is for me to booze. This is for you. This is also to booze. -Happy. Sir, what about him? He is not at all my son. If you can, sell him and booze. Sir...sir...sir... Oh, no! My dad is not here. He went inside. Pavithra! Uncle, such a big bandage on hand! Dear, leave the bandage. Yell him. What happened? Wondering what happened? I lost my pride. Your husband and my son... Look at the water tanker. Go inside and take rest. The nurse told you not to strain, right? Is that all she said? I too booze but a little. But he boozed high and was inebriated. What kind of alcohol you boozed? Hey, when did I booze? You got hurt on hand, right? But talking like you got hurt on head? Don't twist. He is cheating all as if he is good. Drunkard. Is it true what uncle says? Did you booze? I swear on your dad, I didn’t booze. Why can't you swear on your dad? I got hurt just and tied a bandage. You are asking to swear on me. Do you have sense? Why are you scolding me, uncle? Sorry, dear...Sorry... Hey, do you have sense? Drinking alcohol is not a mistake. But you hid it from us, that's a mistake. That's a big mistake. I feel ashame to speak to him. You ask him. Strictly ask him. Hey, is this enough? Do you believe what he says. Leave him. I'm starving. Serve me food. No food at home. Hey, atleast get me dosa. There is no batter. Will you come drunk and expect me to cook for you? Wondering you believe his words! Uncle will never lie. Will he lie on you only today? You no need to cook, I'll order pizza. Pizza...pizza...pizza... Grandpa, we are getting pizza. Why do I need pizza at this old age? Ask your dad to order for chicken pizza? Dad, order chicken pizza. I have ordered, dear. Why is he saying that I was drunk? She will be angry for no reason. When it'll arrive? -Wait, it'll come. Hey...hey... -Take it, dear. That's for me. -That's for me. Come...come... -Come, let's go. Oh, no! Sir, tell me. Won't you call back? Sir... -Sir... Give me, sir. Sir, I'll finish all work tomorrow. I'll work on Sunday also, sir. Please, sir. Sir, I have another delivery. It's getting late. Take it. Sir, give me the money in hand. Sir, don't fall on foot. Sir, take the money and give in hand. Sir, it's only my mistake. Leave me, let me take it. Sir, why should you take it? Pizza, take it and go. I'm telling you, right? It was him who dropped the money. Did he drop money in your account? Do you know who he is? A great guy in this area. Sir, don't say all this. -He is a teetotaller. How dare you ask him to take it? You take it. Sir, don't speak disrespectfully. Shall we change the gender? Dude, leave from here without creating ruckus. It's hell today. Sir, why are you explaining him? Don't we know about these people? They cross the traffic signals. They will complete a degree and take up this temporary job. Do you get PF? Even yesterday I saw about these people in news. They are selling weed in the name of delivery. If we open this container, it'll be clear whether it contains cannabis or opium. Sir, mind your words. Is he reading news to mind his words? Haughty! Haughty! Give the keys, sir. I have given it.. Hey, what's the problem? -Hey, leave now. Go...go... He paid you, right? Better leave. I missed four quarter bottles. Okay, take the keys and go. Go...go... Hey, matted-head! Bald-headed! What are you looking at? -Go...go... Go away. We are weak in tress but too strong in war. You become haughty when indulged in fight. Can I get twenty rupees? Leave now... Beggar. He isn't giving money. Then, how is your father doing? He is good. Will you taste pizza? No, no... I never eat foreign food. Thank you. He creeped me out. Chew and eat. Where's the pizza for me? Pavi, get it ready soon. Today the manager will be waiting to scold me. Show the leg properly. Dear! -Uncle! I'll go to check-up. Okay, go safe. Better take him along. No, dear! No need. Enough of what he did yesterday. I'll take care. Bye, dear kids! -Bye, grandpa. Be safe, uncle. Come. Are you ready? It's getting late, hurry up... Dad, I want to go to toilet. Hey, do you have to poop when leaving in hurry? It's urgent. Okay, go. Go, give me the bag. Already it's late. Dear, won't you check all this? Pavi, he doesn't understand my stance. Clean up and bring him soon. Oh, god! Hey, why are you stretching your hand instead of cleaning up? Swear me. Swear that you will never drink again. A drunkard must swear to it, why should I? You don't talk anything. Come...come... Swear now. Why should I swear? Mom! Mom, come and clean up. If you don't swear, you clean up and take him. Mom, come fast and clean up, it's getting late to school. Dad, do it fast. Swear on god now. One large beer. Hey, why can't you believe me when I say I didn't booze? Hey, I'm saying the truth. -Dear! Dear! Pavithra! I'll go for check-up. -Okay, uncle. Dear, Pavithra! I'll go for check-up. Dear, Pavithra! I'll go for check-up. Pavithra, I'm leaving. Uncle, are you going for check-up? No, dear. I'm going to watch a movie. Welcome. Beggar, he arrived so soon without a gift. You are doing the function grandeur. Isn't there hot drinks? Hey, don't wander. Let the function end. When will the function end? Go...go... Okay, let it end. Hi, Madhi sir! I was expecting you. What a surprise, sir! Thank you for coming. Didn't you expect me then? Go, dad. Hey, invite those who have come instead you're saying to go. Welcome, mam! Hello! -Sir, the decoration is amazing! Yes sir, all are original flowers. I have arranged for candid photography also. It seems you've spent more. -Pavithra, come and sit here. I haven't done like this. This will be a great memory to your son. Yes, sir. Our life is a great memory. All these are like treasures. We must save it. Sir, stand together. Juice server! Sir, let it be. -Please. Have it, sir. No, not now, sir. It's okay, sir. -Let it be. Drink it, sir. Sir, but you feel shy even to have juice. You're the real teetotaller. I'm going to bring up my son like you, sir. You won't leave. Hey, Sundaram! It has been a long time since I saw you. How are you doing? Hey, don't bother about me. Will you be alive for next festival? I'm asking you too. If I join these people, I too will get old. Old monks, damn it. -Why not I share with you? -I have borrowed money for interest and doing this function grandeur. -You can keep eating briyani till served last. Should you do this function by taking loan? Who is he? He just came, grabbed it and drinking. He must be thirsty but a great man! No..no...I'll be late. Briyani, sir! -Tell me, sir. The briyani smells great! Shall I eat briyani? A little...just a little... Shall I eat? Wait, I'll give. Sir! sir! What are you doing? Wait... -Sir! Wait, I'm searching for good leg piece. -Sir, what are you doing? Sir, all are going to eat. Sir, first take off your hand. Sir, are you drunk? Yes, I had juice. Sir, go away. Were you not served? Saravanan sir, serve juice for him. Hey, move away. Oh, cake? Sir, you've made it a grandeur. Everything is amazing! Briyani is delicious! Thank you, sir. Sir, what function is this? Sir, are you making fun? It's a birthday function, sir. Happy birthday to Saravanan sir. Though bald-headed, you are enjoying the life well. Sir, it's my son's birthday. Oh, for your son? I forgot it. Come on, dear! What's this? -What? Your son too is having bald-head like you, sir. Sir, that's not bald-head. We have tonsured his head in temple. Sorry, sister...sorry... Saravanan, hold the child. Your son's name seems to be wrong. No, sir. It's a good name. I named him after checking astrology. Look down, there is a mistake in your son's name on the cake. Yes, sir! The baker has written it wrong. Lunatic guy. Hey, you too is lunatic? Come... Hey, leave me. Why are behaving indecent? Are you drunk again? You sinner! I just told you that day, you didn't believe me. Where did he go and booze? Drunkard! Am I drunk? No, dad. I'm honest. You asked for briyani, will you have now? You sweared on god too. Really I just had juice. What now? You want me to swear? Just blow it...just blow it... Pavi, I swear I had just juice. Oh, sinner! Are you drunk? The cake I bought for my son was spoiled. Sir, only the candle was broken. Look the cake, it's in the hand. What to do for the candle? Sir, I have made it excellent. Ask your bald-headed son to come soon and cut the cake. Hey, give me the match box. Hey! -Come...come... Superb! Superb! Move away. -Hold him. You shouldn't weep. -Hey, Madhi! Hey, leave me. When I'm talking to him... Hey, get lost. Go away. -Shut up. You are my kin! Hey, bald-head! Don't push. I'll not spare you. -Only cake is left for today. It's for you. Sorry, Unni...sorry... Now the function has got over, where is the stuff? Leave me. Have you started earlier to school? Oh, no! It's already late. Pavi, get me hot water. Late... She is furious it seems. I'll sort it tonight. Dad, where have you been? I went to buy rope to hang. What's the need to get swing for kids now? It's not for kids, it's for me. Why do you need swing at this age? How was the function? It went on. Dad, what are you blabbering? What will happen if Saravanan hear this? You get inside. Why are you talking to a drunkard? Dear, give respect to his age. Why are you talking harsh? I said you, drunkard. Pavi! I'm not Pavi but a sinner who married you. People are laughing at me for marrying a drunkard. Why? What happened? You mean what happened? You had boozed and spoiled the function. When did I booze? Don't act, I personally witnessed. We too witnessed it. Though drunk, you must stay silent. Being my son, you were flattened. Ashame of you. You have nothing to do with this family. You drink and get lost. Go... Hey, I was drinking and enjoying thinking you will take care of the family. It seems I have to carry the burden of the family from now on. It's okay, I have to take up the burden. Come, I have to take you to school everyday. Brother, why are you sober? Are you not well? No, If I say my family I didn't booze, they are not believing me. I too say the same and even my family is also not believing me. Is this a problem, brother? But you go home drunk, I'm not doing anything. You will never drink, why is this all of a sudden? Have you got caught by trying something? It's all because of my father. He provokes her and she turns furious on me. Not bothered about her but even my father calls me an alcoholic. Don't feel bad. Even my children are ignoring me. I feel downhearted. Is it greens fritters? I'll take one. I'm leaving. Pavithra, did you ask your husband? Everyone is talking about him. Why? He was good, isn't it? Yes, sister. He was a teetotaller. He came home straight from office. Why? Any problem at home? No problem at all, sister. He never behaved like this all these years. Don't know when he is drinking! He don't carry the bottles also. If this continues, I'm worried he might become like his father. I have redeemed, why are you still blaming me? Look Pavithra, it must be your father-in-law doing all this. Are you provoking her, you witch? Uncle! This is the stance if I stay good. Damn it. Sorry, sister! He is not the same as before. Now he has changed. Whatever, it's said "drunkard never quits". Your father-in-law is old but take care of your husband. Dear! What to do tomorrow? What to do means? I asked what to cook tomorrow? You do steamed flour layered with coconut, will you do it? The side dish for it is chenna gravy, right? It'll be tasty. Will you do me a favor? Don't ask me to cook. Not that, dear. There will be some problems in the office. For that sake, it is not right to change. Earlier, you will tell me whatever happens. But now, you aren't saying anything. A big space has been formed. That's why I said that one child is enough. You didn't listen me. Look, there is no space on bed also. I'm not telling about it. Will you come with me for counselling? Counselling? I have inquired in many places. Even heavy drinkers will redeem it seems. You've started just now, it'll be alright easily. Please come. That's what I was thinking. Is that why I'm getting the steamed flour? Would you do or not, if I tell you? Damn it. Hey, be quiet. I'm already tensed, don't irritate by calling for counselling. I'm telling you I didn't booze. Enough of it. The children are sleeping. You always utter lies. Tell me the truth, where did you hide the bottles? I disposed to scrap shop. You must be disposed. I got two children trusting you. Hereafter, I'll serve you only porridge. I won't come to counselling or anywhere. Better sleep. Damn it. Have you lost sleep because of me? No, what about me? Who are you talking to? Who are you talking to now? My friend. Who is your friend? My friend is in night duty. Is he a watchman? Hello, wait a minute. My son has come. Madhi, I want to say you something. Already I'm tensed, Let's talk in the morning. Oh, god! Suddenly my son came. I have managed him. He thought you are a watchman. Have you done it? -Yes, brother. Why? Are you late even today? You look like a sick hen. What happened, brother? Don't know, I feel tired and stomach ache also. You'd have consulted the doctor. I don't have time. Consult soon, brother. Hey, apply the password. Hey, what? I asked you not to call. Hey, wait. Brother, she is thumping me since yesterday. I'll go ask what's the matter and be back. Please, please, I'll go, talk to her. Go... Here it is...here it is... Take it. You'll puke if you take anymore. Come...come...come... Smile. I love you Pavi! Brother, was it done? Sorry, brother! I got late. Shall we go, sir? It's dancing...it's playing... Madhi, just a minute. Sir, no...no... sir, no... Hey, give the money. Sir, you grab money at every nook and corner. You feel bad as if I am taking your money. You will not let any money to go. Sir, let me try...let me try... Brother, leave the way please. -Hey, what? Sir, I have fifty thousand debt. I'll take it and go if you leave me. I have five lakhs debt. Go, follow the line. (Indistinct Voices) Brother, what to do? Don't know. Lift everything. Lift everything, nothing should be here. What you people are fed with? You eat food because of this job, If you can't do this job properly, get lost. Sir! Hey! Sir, it was only my mistake. It happened unknowingly. How many times I have told you to be careful with money? We will be nervous when exchange a hundred rupees in a petty shop. You will lose sleep, isn't it? Instead of hundred rupees, you have kept five hundred rupees. They have taken away. Don't know how much was lost. But you just say that it was your mistake, damn it. Where did you go to roam? Sir! He will never go anywhere without the headset. Big cheese. Sir, I don't know how it happened. Don't talk, if you talk anymore, I'll hit you. How dare you were drunk when in job? Sir, I didn’t drink. Are you lying to me who employed you? Everyone come here. Look..look... If not drunk, what's this called? Is it performance? I didn't drink, sir. No job for you both here, go... Sir... Go, no job for you here anymore. Sir, forgive this time. Please, sir. My family will be thrown on the street, sir. If I give you a job, my family will be thrown on the street. Sir, I'll repay the money, don't expel me. -Get out. Sir...sir... -You won't understand if said this way. Security! Sir! -Sir...sir... Just ask them to get out. Sir, don't expel me from the job. I said get out. -Sir..sir... Sir...sir...sir... -Come out, sir. Go out. Please sir. Don't expel me from the job, sir. Please, sir...sir... -Come, sir. Please sir, don't expel me from the job. -Come out, sir. Sir, how to survive without a job. -Come, sir. Take it, just a mouthful. Take it. Dear, why are you fully wet? Didn't you go for job? Took leave today? What happened? I lost my job. I pleaded you not to drink, did you listen me? It happened just as I feared. Now you lost the job, what are you going to do? If we don't have salary for a month... Pavi, I didn’t drink. I don't know what's happening around me. Atleast you trust me. -I trusted you. I proudly told everyone that my husband is a teetotaller. You've become a drunkard. That's right, you've inherited your father's habit. I swear on our children, I didn’t drink. Damn it, you are making false promise. Aren't you ashamed? I said I didn't drink. Guest has come, open the door. Bless your father, dear. Vanitha, step in with right leg. Hey! -Step in carefully. Shall we give leave letter citing our grandpa's marriage? Madhi...Madhi... Sir, don't expel me from job, don't do, sir. I'm the doctor. Doctor, this is how I faint often. You didn't faint, you're intoxicated. Yes, the name of the disease you have... ABS. Auto Brewery Syndrome. It's a rare syndrome. It has come to some people abroad. I think you are the first person here. Whenever you have high carbohydrate levels in your body... ... the yeast in your body will overgrow and produce ethanol which leads to intoxication. Whatever junk food you take is like alcohol to you. Is this a disease? Please forgive me. I told you, did you believe me? Doctor, is there any cure for this disease? There is no medicine for this, Madhi. We should change our life style according to our disease. All I have is life, no style, doctor. Take care not to overload your body's carbohydrates. Do not eat too much food. What kind of food should not be taken? White rice, coffee, sugar, milk, fritters, pasta, pizza, burger... ...cakes, fruit juices, liquids, icecream, etc..etc.. Doctor, it seems I'll just have to take the pill. As long as the body is fine, it'll listen to us. If there is something wrong with the body, then we should listen to what it says. I'm on a diet right now, you know? Drunkards are fine until 60 to 70 years old. I don't have any bad habits. All I can do is eating food which I am fond of... That is the only happiness I have. Is that also gone, doctor? They say that all the sins of the father will be passed on to the son. Hey, you don't talk. I feel frustrated when seeing you. Madhi dear! When can we take him home, doctor? If you pay the bill you can go. Sir, why such strange diseases affect only the poor? Don't worry, believe in Bhagavan. Whenever you have any doubt, just give me a call. Oh, are you Bhagavan? Okay, doctor. Sir, sorry sir. Please forgive me this time. We have to wait for you, isn't it? Not like that, sir. I'm sick. I'm struggling without job, I have no choice other than you, please sir. The bank strictly said that the agency should return the money. You do one thing, you go and see the bank manager. Lord, still how long I have to suffer? A total of eight lakhs thirty five thousand has gone, do you know that? Sorry, sir. You must have the details of who has taken the money, with that... Don't we know this? By the time you changed the money... The ATM machine was crashed due to power outage. All the existing data has been corrupted. So, we don't know who took the money and how much they took. Nothing could be done from our side. The cops are also investigating. So we have said that the agency should take responsibility. They told me. They fired me out of job, sir. I understand your problem. But this is the bank. Money is the only language we speak here. You give the money. We will say the agency that we have recovered money. You will get back your job. I am earning just 15,000, sir. Even if I work for another eight years, I can't arrange that much money. Can you arrange the money or not? I will arrange the money, sir. Is there any other way to do this? Our technical team will be there if you go down. They will tell you everything in detail. Excuse me, sir. -Yes, tell me sir. Wasn't there an incident at the ICF ATM two days ago? Is it about misplacing 500 rupees notes? You said that it was misplaced, it was me who had done that... Tell me, what's the matter? I saw the manager, if you give the details of those who took the money... We have been toiling on it for two days. Since the machine was corrupted, we don't know what to do. Sir, can we try to recover the data... We have tried all those things. It will run till dawn and shows nothing. Something like CCTV... Is there any address in it? Your video is the last one. It was also not properly recorded due to power cut. If there is any ATM theft, we will trace using the footage... ...from the nearby tea shop and petrol station. We can't do anything with this footage. There won't be clarity at all. Sir, isn't there any other way? Don't have hopes. Give me your number, I'll call you if I get anything. Okay, sir. Tell me, brother. They say that if I pay back the money in the bank, we can join the job. Is it, how much? Mom, get me water. That is, eight lakhs thirty five thousand. I'm trying my best to arrange it, can you help me? Brother, check for the possibility. Thousand crows will come for rice on the roof. Brother, better look for someother job. Mom, serve me gravy. Sorry, you're affected because of me. I thought of taking up another job in a few days. There is no growth in this. Take care, brother, bye. Mom, serve me food. Sir, just a minute. I am stuck with a problem, please help me if you have money. Dare to ask me money after ruining my Unni's birthday function? Sorry, sir. It happened by mistake. Did it happen by mistake? You ruined it. When you hit, it's not just the cake that got ruined but also my family. Have you both become friends forgetting everything that happened? Oh, you are not! Really sorry sir, I didn't do anything purposely that day, sir. Take your son from here, else I'll become a beast. Monkey-headed, he is apologizing, what bothers you still? He will do mistakes and apologize, should I show off my teeth? Who will see your teeth? Go away. Why are you talking to him? Are you an esteemed person, dad? You got married at this age. I'm good enough, I got married. what is your problem? Ask everyone, your family's honour is stinking. If it stinks, I'll spray the perfume. You cover your nose and go. Look, speak with respect, dad. Often if you call me "dad", I'll yell at you. I have just got married. Won't my wife think me wrong? I'm letting you go because the ice cream is melting. If not, I will bang your head, be careful. A drunkard son born to a drunkard father. What a good family! You must be thrashed and chased away from here. Hey, it's wrong to let you free. -Hey, get lost. I'll hit you with footwear. Get lost. Dear, what about your visit to office? They are asking for eight lakhs thirty five thousand. Oh, no! Where to get such huge money? Is it possible? What about some other job? No, I can’t, Pavi. How can I take up another job after all these years, it's a hell everyday. If I stay like this, I think I will become an object in this house like TV and fridge. I have struggled a lot in this job. After all these years, how can I suddenly switch to another job? Not only that, to my conscience, I didn't do anything wrong. In that case, how can I leave this job? If God closes one door, He will definitely open the other. Big cheese... Everyone flee away. Who are they fussing over? Dear, take it. This is for you and this is for me. For us, it is ice. It's alcohol for him. Don't know who to ask. Hey, I said about money. I was running beyond the job all these days. When looking back, I don't even have a single friend to lend me money. That's why, you have to talk cheerfully to everyone like me. This is what happens if you stay silent. You never utter anything, I have lost all dignity because of you. Do they belong to the lineage of musk deer? I am worried that I'm not be able to host the reception. Life is like this ice. It'll melt either if you taste or waste it. I'm already worried what to do next month without salary. Your step-mom is going to job. I'll talk to her. I'll yell at you. He will get scoldings from others and show his anger on me. You just lost the job, right? If not this job, you'll get another one. Oh, everyone has kept the gate open and calling me. If I go to a new job, won't they ask how I lost the old job? And this disease is a hell. A dark disease that doesn’t have a name. With what confidence can I move to a new job? I couldn't tell about this disease in the office where I worked for so long. Where else I can say about this? Hey, what's this? No need to say anything. It's my problem. I'll take care. Hello! -Dr.Bhagavan? Yes. Sir, I'm Madhi. A disease like intoxication without drinking. Oh, yes! Tell me, Madhi! How are you? I don't know, sir. Any medicine, treatment, you can even do surgery, sir. But I want a speedy recovery, sir. I told you that day, there is no cure for your disease. -Don't panic for that sake. Eat healthy, exercise regularly and take care of yourself. Don't worry, everything will be fine. Okay, take care. Brother! Tell me, brother. Three days ago an ATM at ICF.... Yes, it was damaged. It must have been dismantled now. Who are you? Sir, I'm coming from the bank. Do you've the hard disk of the machine? Sir, we checked the ATM from ICF, isn't it? I got a skimming device from it, sir. Here it is, sir! It has become routine. If we carry the purse, they pickpocket it. So if we keep in the machine, they find something for it too. Sir, what's this? You're from the bank, don't you even know this? It's the skimming device, brother. If this is fixed in the machine, the details of the cash takers will be stored. By doing this, they steal money from their account without their knowledge. Keep this separately. Inform the bank and they will inform the cops. It will be a headlines in news but they will not find. Here are the details you asked for. Since I fell in the ditch, I fell in love with you. You tied the bandage, not only to my hand but to my heart too. That left off mind... -Hello! Hello! -That left off...left off... -Can you hear me? -Hello! I said I brought only that left off mind. Being my father, you've done a right thing only today. Kissing on my head! Hey, no! He is our son Madhi. Hey, you suspect me as soon as I tied the knot. Damn it, hang up the call. I thought of speaking with love... Can you give me the account details which were recorded for the whole day, sir? Please, sir. Why are you staring at the paper for so long? This is the list of people who took money in ATM. I have found this with skimming devices and the details recorded in the bank. Now, even if I give this, they will take the money... ...but they will not take me to the job. What are you going to do now? Hello, in an ATM at ICF, you've withdrawn 500rs notes instead of 100rs, if you return it... Hello! Hello! -Hello! -Sir, in ICF... -ICF? I didn't see. Sir, you've withdrawn the money. -Hello! -Hello! Sir, in ATM... Sir, the money you've withdrawn in ATM... -Hello, I'm doctor Bhagavan speaking. Sorry, sir. I called by mistake. How many calls will you make, Madhi? Don't you have any other job? Recently I lost my job, sir. Hey, do you have sense? What can I do if you've lost the job? You call me often and disturbing me. Am I sitting idle here? Sorry, sir. Hello! -Who is that? Sir, I'm speaking from Mayura bank. -Yes, keep going. Your account has got an instant loan offer, sir. -Loan? Yes, sir. You don't need to do anything. We will come straightaway to your address and issue it, sir. -It seems to be good but not to the address given in the account. Okay, sir. -Come to Arihant building. Hello, I called you from the bank. -Loan guy? -I'm just waiting for you. -Is there a big building next to you? Yes, sir. -Can you see a decent Tasmac shop opposite to it? Yes, sir. -Exactly there, come inside. Sorry, sister. Sir, will you give me fifty rupees. I don't have money to go home, sir. Are you still going home? From past one month? Sir, I have arrived. Where are you? Look, I'm showing my hand, Can you see a pen in my hand? Okay, sir. Sir, Amirtham... Yes, definitely. Be seated. Brother, did you bring the loan? Yes, I brought it. Kulukka, come here. Take a 500rs note and give him. Give him. Let's deduct in the loan. Will he get caught or not? He was caught. Kulukka, it's for my routine stuff. You bring it. Which bank are you from? Sir, I'm from Mayura bank. Yeah, it's a good bank... How will you lend me a loan? We will come and give loans to those who work well, sir. I don't have a job at all. Though you don't have a job, what about your family background? The size of this table is my home. Even for that, I owe rent for four months. There is a scheme for that, sir. For those who are struggle like you... Sir, we give loan to booze. Loan! Sir, give for me. -Give for me... I lied you. Did you lie? Wait...wait... He just lied. Go, brother. You sit. Do I have a loan? Sir, last week on 10th, at an ATM in ICF, Rs 500 was distributed instead of Rs 100. You're one among those who took the money. How dare you call me a thief? Being intoxicated, I changed the denominations. Oh, are you similar like me? No...no...I never boozed. Let it be...let it be... But I have a disease like I'm intoxicated, sir. Even if I taste this cool drinks, I'll be intoxicated, sir. Don't make fun, go away. I don't get high even if I booze full bottle. Look, he is really making fun. Did he think of it as beer? Brother! Hey, brother! What happened? When? This is what my problem, sir. Is this a problem? It's a boon...a boon... Do you know how much had I spent for this intoxication? But you got it easily. I should become like you. Please teach me how you got it. I don't know, sir. Be seated. -Okay. Please teach me. -Will you taste chips? Hello, sir! Hey, silence! The cheetah has come alone! If you have guts, come front. Hey, I will take care. Sir! He became intoxicated after taking cool drinks. I'll become like him. (Indistinct Voices) The bottle can bend but not the drunkard. My pen fell down, boss. Okay, leave it. Is he the one? Yes. He looks like a crushed alcohol glass, did he do? Don't judge him by looks. He turned intoxicated just for having cool drinks. Had you enquired about him? No, boss, hereafter I have to enquire. - I'll go check. He is in hurry like puking when we booze. Take it. Okay, boss. Hey, take off your hand. Be quiet, children are here. Don't turn me. Boss! Sir, don't harm me. I'll not do anything to you. You've come to a right place. What's your name? Madhi, sir. -Madhi... What's your father's name? -Sundaram. What's your grandfather's name? Sir, you... It won't be good if I boast myself. -He woke up from intoxification. He was afraid of the boss. -Because the boss is haughty. Boss, is it sore throat? Shall I get you stuff with pepper? -The fear of death was visible in his eyes. Madhusuthanan, head of All India drunkards association. Have you heard? No. It's me! There might be villages without party flag... ...But not without alcohol. Yes, he has sacrificed his life for sake of drunkards. It's him who taught us to live with dignity. If a drunkard has a problem, our association will come. If drinking is a problem, I will come myself. Yes! -That's great of him! You no need to come. It's enough if you get money from him. Why are you in hurry? Did you call me, boss? I never saw a person like you in my experience. You're a born miracle. If you give me the money... Still I have to collect from eight people. Eight people? How? Will you get from them all alone? Or will anyone give you if you go alone? Amirtham writes the accounts from morning to evening.. I have accepted since you're a drunkard. Will I accept it for a teetotaller? Hereafter, it's our problem. The association will stay strong behind you. I will stand with you. You are promising words in hurry. You don't hurry. Everything has a reason. "You will know it at the right time" Hey, why can't you write it on a large paper or board? Our boss has vision problem. No boss, I just said. I spent two rupees even for this. You've decided to collect money without spending anything. He isn't praising you, he is pulling your legs. Already you've evidence, what else you want? This isn't enough, sir. I have to make them agree that they took all that money. Is that all? If we serve alcohol to all, then they'll vouch the truth. Come, let's go. The planning is over. Come... Hey, shut up! That isn't so easy, sir. If people's money gets stuck in ATM, somehow they'll get their money back. If we ask them for the money they took, they'll abandon us. You're right! -I'm telling about you, brother. Each individual will differ from one another. The only way to get back the money is we should follow them. And watch their whereabouts and then draft a meticulous plan. For that... -For that? All of you should be in good state of mind. Why not? Once we booze we'll be in good state of mind. A small issue, till this project gets over, no one should booze. Boss! Boss! How can we stop it? Hey, cool! for everything there is a reason, you'll know it at the right time. Then, for completing the plan it might take a month or two. Until then, you all must accompany me. Okay! Sir, without second thought you agreed to it? Why did you ask like this? Being with you is our job. From marriage to death, we are present everywhere. Only a drunkard works all 365 days a year without taking leave. If this Government is to run, the liquor we consume is the fuel. Only if he booze, anyone can step in the fort. We all are very cool and friendly like a gin. But if hatred, then we will enrage furiously like a beer.

You said to come by 4 o'clock, right? Yes, what's the time now? It's 4 o'clock. Then you must've come by 3.30, poor guy. Haven't others arrived yet? The boss expected any time in rocket. Is this the rocket? Yes, smoke emanates from behind. Look.... Good evening, boss. Hey, why are you astounded? It's my car since 1977. Does this function? You ask like as if I pushed it till end of the street and drove from there. I understand, don't judge looking at the front, come see at the back. It looks like a car but it's a bar inside. Unlike Tasmac, no extra money here, we are clean and honest. Great! Close it. Wonder, do you even latch it? Tasmac itself is robbed by drilling a hole. Our bar doesn't even have insurance. Sir, kindly consider my issue too. Hey, what about the address? The address is right, it's that yellow coloured house. Where are you going? Let's collect the money, give him and move to next one. Wait, let's check about him. Come here...come here. What a great person he is, Definitely he'll give back the money. You'll get back your money. How sir? Do you know him? The one who is kind to animals will not deceive others. Is it so! Yes, boss. Then, let's talk to him. Sir, I feel let's wait and... -Don't worry. This world is filled with love, trust people. "To discern the truth in everything, by whomsoever spoken..." Hey, he has left. Come, let's go... Hey, come! -Stop...stop... -Sir...sir... Who do you want? You... -Hey! We came looking for Sukumar. -Yes, he is here. When will he come? Tomorrow is the marriage. Marriage? Where? Didn't I tell you, he is rich, he will return the money. Hey, evenly arrange it. He looks like a parent of two kids, then how come marriage! Boss, don't insult, he might had an ambition. It might've fulfilled now, You don't worry. This world is filled with love. Shut up. Come. Sir, we need to talk to you. That is... Happy married life, sir. Advance wishes. Have you thought it's my marriage? Yes, sir. I'm already married and I'm an event organiser here. I'll kill you. Boys, serve them cool drinks. Thank you. -Tie it soon and come, still more work to do. Tell me, for what function can I help you? At ICF road SRB ATM, Rs.500 notes came instead of Rs.100, you've also taken money from it. Hey, stop it. Hey, get back the cool drinks. Sir, is this you! Don't you've love? Who are you? Your video was recorded on the ATM camera. We take wedding video with an expensive camera but people cheat that it's not them. If a mediocre camera is kept in the ATM, how can it be a proof? Moreover, for the mistake done by the bank, why should I pay, go away. Hey, better return the five lakhs. Hey, it's only fifty thousand rupees. Now you got caught, what you said is the evidence, return the money now. Are you intoxicated? If not, will you buy me? If you don't leave, I'll thrash you. Hey, do you know who you're talking to? Are you making fun? Hey, what? Okay, leave it, sir. We tried our best, let's see. So far we spoke to him, next we are going to question him. Tomorrow at marriage, we will teach him a lesson. My grandson, I wish to see his marriage before I die. Sir, why like this? Photo! Photo! Hey, over or not? Over, sir. If done, let me know. It's over, sir. Sorry sir, these guys... No...no...let them do their work. This marriage should go perfect. No compromise. Sure sir, I'll make it the best. My wishes, sir. How did the power restore? Didn't I tell you, there will be generator in wedding hall. Wait, I will go, grab the fuse carrier. Hey wait, there isn't fuse carrier for it. Don't touch somewhere and get charred. . Boss, then can't we do anything? It just started, still we have time. Yes, there many food items, First, take this. Why are you mixing without liquor? He will not drink during the day, I'll drink. Better drink now. By the way, to who are you related? Bride or bridegroom? Mother-in-law's relative. Don't play with me. Just in three hundred seconds, all must complete your work. Start. -Okay, boss. Why is he having water gun like a child? Hey, it's not water gun, it's a quarter gun, you come. Brother, you stay here and watch if anyone is coming. Hey, you said us not to be intoxicated while working but you're not. Sir, saliva is secreting... Why not, even alcohol will secret along. Is it okay? Hey, come. Dear, let's get rid of that drunkard family. Listen, it has already been four years since I turned 40. You've wasted the time citing some reasons. Even after this, if you try to stop this marriage, I'll be furious. Why did you go alone? Had you called me, I'd have come. You aren't staying at a place. Granny, are you better now? I'm unable to tolerate the pain. She says she is better, come let's go continue the marriage. When did I tell you? You must tell... Listen granny, for sake of the marriage I took loan after a great struggle. If you die and halt this marriage, I'll smash you. Hey, have you properly taken the pills? Yes, I took. Everyone listen carefully, Until my first night gets over... ...and I open the door in the morning, no one should die. If any one screws up, then I will recall you from death and kill you again. Be careful! Ready! Start! (Musical lines from Roshomon) Will you do like this? Hey, event! It's okay. He came majestically. -Marriage is very important! Dude, you didn't get hurt, right? It's okay. Do ten sit ups, you'll be fine. He is a lunatic. Hey, can we proceed the marriage? Yes, you can. How about first night? Okay, come... -Lift him up. Lift him. -Be careful, be slow! Slowly... slowly... Dude! Sorry, sir. What will I do with your apology? It's hurting in between the legs. That's why, I said no need of these events. Sir, have some juice, you'll feel better. Drink some juice, sir. Oh, great! Thank you. Hey, walk like a bridegroom. -Who gave this idea of scepter? It's me sir, thought it'd be different. It's very different! Come along till the stage. Hold me. Bring the bride, it's getting late. Thank you. (Chanting of Mantras) Don't keep gazing at the bride. Repeat the mantra I say, repeat it. Sit down. Shall I put it? The bride is like a perfume and bridegroom is like phenyl. Dude, someone is saying ill about you. Get up, we'll see to it. Why? If I get up, are you planning to sit here? Till the marriage gets over, I'll never move. Why should I bother? As you wish. You might go behind and talk in different voice, you better sit here. Oh, God! If I get hold of you... Hey, you're in our hold. Better return the money, this is the last warning. Are you threatening me? Yes, you two whirl-head. Sir, I never behaved like this, now I feel bold. This is just breakfast, still meals is due. What happened? Nothing! Swamy, how long will it take? Still there are many rituals to do. Why are you in a hurry? Yes, I'm in a hurry, swamy. Hey, proceed. Hey, who blow the reed wind? Disgusting... Dude, your family is very indecent. May be it's because of sambar fritters? It's because of curd fritters, please keep quiet. Hey, hurry up. Go get the mangalsutra blessed from all. Hey, why you gave it there? Why are you irritating me! Bridegroom, stand up. You seem to be very decent, but keep on farting. He is trobling me. Not now, be seated. Hey, what harm did I do to you, why are irritating me? Don't know what happened! Hey, all are leaving. Hey, give me the mangalsutra, I'll tie the knot. You go ahead, leave me. Swamy, go carefully. Give me...give me... Tie the knot, can't chant mantras. Oh, gosh! Oh, no! Damn it. Hey, why she is leaving? No... Will you eat? For sake of collecting money from me, you played tricks with everyone. Will you pay me now or shall I attend all the marriages? I can't tolerate it, enough! Brother, is it the right address? -Yes, sir. This seems to be a rich house and many people are here, how to find him? I have his phone number, I'll call him. Hello! Brother, the god is with us. Boss. Oh, is he the one we look for? We will manage, boss. Phone call, brother. Hello! Hey, he looks like dressed up to a palm tree. Will he be the one we came for? God, don't you've mercy? Brother, don't hit me....brother... You debtors! Are you dare enough to cheat me? Hey, tie them and feed with dog food... ...that too once in two days. It's not like last time. He seems to be a thug. Excuse me. -Yes. Will this share auto go to Nandanam? Hey, does it look like a share auto to you? Then, is it a submarine? Hey, you...I'll thrash you. -Cool...cool man... Boss, it's enough if we separate him from the crowd. We will abduct him in this vehicle and flee on bypass road. Hey, already I underwent bypass surgery. If this plan go messy, confirmedly I have to do next bypass surgery. Boss, we can do this with courage. Brother, trust me, I'll get you the money from the tall guy. Who? You? Alone? Will you? I mean altogether. How is it possible in this clan? We will do some drama and bring him alone first. Then, let's go slowly behind him. Suddenly let's open the door and push him inside and close the door. Can we do like this? -How? Let's give diarrhea pill to all like we did in the marriage. If something goes wrong, we will be left to wash all the toilets. Then, you can tell something. Just be patient. Will good ideas spark in a day? Sir, if we go to their house and rob only our money? They are big thieves, will they let us to steal them? Moreover, I can't climb the wall at this age. Then, do you have any idea on mind? Be patient, will a good idea spark in two days? Boss, better let's abduct the tall guy's wife... I can understand your plan. Shut your trap. You... I know what are you going to ask. Will good ideas spark in three days? Just be patient. Have you got any idea? Yeah, I have an idea. What's that idea, boss? Hey, don't you've sense? Will you bang like this? How to follow you then? Boss, nothing happened to you, right? It's going to happen hereafter. Boss, tell us your plan. That's the only solution. Really I don't have any idea, I just said to boast myself. Hey, what's going on there? Sir, he got hurt on his head. Who'd have hit him? I think he'd have switched on the fan, standing. If you say the truth about yourselves, you can go home safe. Instead if you tell me tales, you will not be spared, tell me. Oh, no! "Debt crushes the bone" Sir, we have come to take loan. Why? Piles to our boss, sir. That is, he is saying about the star. That is, "organic alcohol", I have an idea like that. Alcohol means liquor. Is organic meant for foreign stuff? No, sir. It's "Natural liquor". Without any chemicals, the tail of the lizard, cow dung... ...unfused battery and footwear, adding such quality things and preparing it, sir. Do we feel intoxic if boozed? It'll make you elated, sir. Let it be, how much do you want? Two lakhs, sir. You're ready to volunteer for this? What about your property? Three crore drunkards are my property. Hey! Apart from that, I own a house. If you want to take loan from me, I need a proof, do you have it? Aadhar card. Hey, take it. Go bring the bond paper. You've to sign and take the money. Sir, what about the interest? You ask as if you're going to pay. I'll take care of it. Boss, you gave your card in hurry. They will look for us and hit, isn't it? Hey, am I a lunatic? Already, it has wrong address. I had it with me thinking it'll be useful for something. He was caught today. Moreover, the bond paper is worthless. We will tear the bond paper and say it tallies the money he took and go on. Sign it. It tallies the money you took in ATM, that's all...that's all... What are you doing? You told me to tear it after taking money. For that sake, will you tear here itself? Instead of tearing outside, we can do it here, here is a dustbin. Hey, are you cheating me? Who? It's you who had cheated. You cheated taking Rs.500 notes. But my boss took money from you and reverted. He is the Chanakya, he is great! Hey, catch them. Hey, no... -Come fast...come fast... -Get on soon. -Come... -Boss, get on. -Get on soon. -Come fast. -Go..go... Boss...boss... -Here...here... -How to get in? Sinner! Go...go... Don't want him.

Wake up... Wonder they go in high speed with that damaged vehicle. Hey, don't you've sense? I have, do you want to taste? Hey, you...I'll hit you if I come. Gorilla monkeys. Hey, why are you smiling? Keep quiet. Take the vehicle. Hey, drive carefully. Don't hit. Oh, no! Boss, come let's flee. They will thump us if get caught. We have to stay back. A count is in pending. And car too. What's that count in pending? Our life is going to end. Oh, no! Boss, save me. Oh, no! Blood is oozing from nose. Come fast, let's go to GH. Boss, save me. Boss! Why are you crawling? I'm yet to hit you. Leave me, brother. It's hurting, leave me. -Hey, how dare! -Are you dare to cheat us? Brother, you look similar to "Motu Patlu" Hey, you Dora-Bujji- headed! Hey, my neck...my neck... Leave my neck. I plead on your foot, I'll not go inside. No, brother. You made me to caught to him. He is hitting hard. They have torn the logo. He is still driving the vehicle, boss. Pour water on his head. Damn it. Excellent, sir! We have planned meticulously and took the money. He too is irritating. What? Your shirt is torn. We were not treated so hard even by cops. You made us to get caught. We were torn apart instead of taking money. Honey, what's the gift for this wedding day? That's the surprise. Close your eyes. Open your eyes. Bring the menu card. Oops! He is my patient. Why are you here suddenly, Madhi? I continously called you, sir. Madhi, it's my personal time. You shouldn't disturb me here too. Please understand my stance. I follow whatever you advised me. I'm doing exercise go for a walk, and only take porridge. I even take water carefully. Even though, I feel inebriated that too all of a sudden. What should I do more than this? Isn't there any solution to this? Madhi, I too don't know any other way, I'm serious. There is no medicine for this disease. This is your life henceforth. Though you hate it, it won't. You start adapting to it. We are getting married. Though we like our wife or not... ...aren't we giving her gifts and proceeding the life? It's also similar. Instead of being afraid, take it as an advantage, adapt yourself to live with it. Are you buying me flowers for this reason?

Boss, why are you asking him? Oh, no! I forgot... Just I'm diabetic, I can't take some. Pity on him, he can't take anything. Sir, it seems you're so happy about this. Brother! -Brother? Is there any ATM nearby? I saw it on the way. I tried there, brother. If I enter Rs.100, I get only that. What else do you want? Brother, in some ATMs if we enter Rs.100, we get Rs.500 it seems. I too searched everywhere in Chennai. See here, I didn’t get anywhere, brother. Wastrel! -What? No, here is a waste land. And a ATM is near to that. If we enter Rs.100, we get Rs.2000 it seems. Rs.2000? Thank you, brother. Yes, go take it. Didn't you come? We work hard to live, go. Thank you, brother. See, someone has turned mad because of you. Don't know how many people are roaming like him. Okay, leave it. Let's see the next one. Can't you take a new printout? Running low of money. Does the printout cost in lakhs? You are too stingy. That's why, the god is punishing you with porridge. Oh, no! Mine is lucky hand! We have bedsheets. Mam, we haven't come to sell bedsheets. We are from the bank. You are Madhavi, right? -Yes. In ICF road ATM, Rs.500 was taken instead of Rs.100, isn't it? You've taken one lakh. Many people have taken like you. We are recovering money from everyone. It's a love marriage. I don't have any relatives. Not in need too. He took care of me. He is too good. He is a teetotaller. That evening, suddenly he got chest pain. I took him to the hospital. Doctors said he got heart attack and must undergo immediate surgery. I asked for money everywhere. I didn't get. Okay, when I went to ATM to take the money we have, I got one lakh instead of twenty thousand. I swear, I took it as a gift from the god. The god who gave the money, took him away from me. Recently I took up a job. I'll repay you every month. Please bear it till then, brother. Please... No need to give back the money. You buy something to the child. Let her study well. One lakh rupees is huge money. But simply you left it. You show more mercy. You gave the chocolate I had to take when my diabetic level is low. Next time if you pity them, better you buy yourself. We the drunkards are fine even when old. Those who are not alcoholic die just at forty years of age. Don't know. She can't repay the money. It's okay, I have decided to give her life. Let this decision be with you, Don't reveal her. Then... Why? Why, boss? Tell me and go, boss... Hey, come here. Where is Rajarajan's house? I want to buy icecream, give me five rupees, I'll tell you. I don't have fund, give him five rupees. Look there, it's her who is cleaning the vehicle. Is it him? His name is said as Rajarajan but he seems like selling lottery tickets. Hey, why are you in hurry? Did you call me, boss? This is different. Boss, we have enemity. Definitely he will not give money if I come. What's that problem? I'll tell you later, boss. Go get money before he leaves. Go soon. Hi, are you Ramarajan? Sorry, Rajarajan? Yes, Who are you? We are bank officials. You can't believe, right? We have come in mufti. You took money in a ATM at ICF. Instead of Rs.100, you got Rs.500 notes. Without revealing it, you're going on. Do you think the law will remain silent? Sir, yes I took it. I'll repay. Hey, brother! Come...come.... You... Were you afraid of him? He agreed to repay as soon as I asked, good guy. Hello, Bin-laden who is hiding beyond, come front. Are you all bank officials? You all look dolts serving porridge in temple and lying as bank officials? Sir, I know your name just now. It's me who changed the denominations in ATM. I lost the job beacuse of it, sir. Have you lost it? You teased my job that day, Now you don't even have that job. Talk patiently. He is explaining you, right? Oldie, since you people are here, it's not necessary that I must repay the money. Hey! Just now you said that you'll repay, immediately you're changing your word. Will you forget when humiilated by someone? I forgot lot of such incidents. Hit him if you want. But you're four people, if you thrash me later... No, we won't do. Okay, leave it. I'll give the money. But I'll not hit you instead I'll give you four tasks. Do you know my name? Rani, right? Rani? I'm Rajarajan. But does the house match my name? So, you clean up the house and make it anew. What! -What? Sir, please. That's it. Does this look like a house? There was more garbage here than in Pallikaranai yard. Boss, he must have kept the money somewhere here. If we find out, our job will be easy, right? There you are! Thank you. What do you say? Boss, will the money be here? It seems to be a camphor box, is he an idiot to keep money in that? Keep it aside and carry on the work. Move away. Not bad... Take out everything. All these must be washed, starched, pressed... ...and must look anew. For that, you can buy new clothes, right? You're talking more, I have extra work for you, come. Go inside. I don't get. Go inside, you'll get, go. The toilet must shine like glass. Hey, go bring one more pot. Boss, women Bruce lee are there near the tap. I was exhausted fighting with them. I'll wash the clothes, will you bring water? Don't you feel pity on me? -They're good enough than this. Oh, gosh! What are you doing? Boss, he told us to apply starch and press it. But it's already done. Hey, throw that away. Hey, I can't do. Please tolerate for my sake, boss. We planned the tasks to collect money from all. But he is giving us the tasks. Yes, boss! Let's go to Tasmac, It's been a long time. I'll kill you. Boss, he was trapped. What's it? A petticoat in a bachelor's room. Definitely he is having an affair. We can lock him with this. Not bad. We worked hard to clean but you say it's not bad. Not bad. Sir, why is he taking petticoat? He is not an ordinary Raja, he is petticoat Raja. Petticoat Raja. What? I said you are Maharaja. That's it. Take it. Only a little sum, What about the balance? You'll get it after you complete the balance work. This is not right. We have done whatever you said. You must not speak against me. You need money, right? Go, do my delivery job. Just wait for two minutes. It's three hundred rupees. Three hundred? Wait, I'll come. Can I get water to drink? Yes, come in. My grandson is like a King, I won't die till he gets married. I'll shut you altogether. What are you thinking? She denied me and left. I couldn't even get another bride. I have spent forty lakhs for the marriage that didn't happen. Okay, leave it. That's normal. What? Is it normal? Why don't you say? You're married, right? Hey, I got married only once. Hey, I'm sparing since you're my dad else I'll stab you. Okay, let it be. Either you wash the dhoti or throw it away. You pooped that day and you haven't washed the dhoti yet. It's stinking. No...no... Dear, give me the money. I'm speaking to him, mom. Since someone didn't pay, four people stopped my marriage. I will catch those four and wash this dhoti in their blood. Until then, let it be there. Let's stay with stenchy odor, only then it'll drive me aggresive. Hey, who are you sticking to the wall like a lizard? I ordered shawarma. Shawarma? -Yes. I'm not yet married, do you need shawarma at this dying age? I'll not give anyone, I'm alone going to eat. How much? It's forty lakhs! forty lakhs! But not married... How much? Three hundred rupees, sir. Share with me, I gave you briyani. Don't show me and eat, you'll get stomach ache. Hey, I have seen you somewhere. Is it me, sir? -Yes. There is no one similar in this world. So, there is no chance you have seen me. No, no, I have seen this face somewhere. Focus...focus...focus... Oh, god! You want mayonnaise, sir? Mayonnaise? I'm almost done, you are giving now. Give me. Take it, sir. I thought of giving five stars to you. Now it's just one star. Bring it fast, come. Simply staring at him. He gave cool drinks in the marriage. Granny! Granny! What happened, granny? Get up. -Mom! What did you do to my mother? Hey, keep quiet. -Mom! Is she creating drama for shawarma? I won't die till you get married. You've seen four world cups saying the same. Mom! -Hey, stop. I have done all your job, give my money. Are you getting angry? You're getting angry, isn't it? Okay, leave it. I'll give you. But one more task, the last one. Tell me. It seems you're a teetotaller. Your friend told me. Today I'll make you lose your virginity. You must booze till I say to stop. You will get your money. Shall I join the competition? It's clear that you're a guzzler. Just shut your trap. Let him booze. I will booze. Just now he did the delivery. His name is Raja... I want his adddress... It's an important matter, that's why... Say it's urgent..urgent... Give it fast, please. Say it's a life matter, his life matter. You know to eat shawarma, say now. I’ll say. Say now...say it... Is it name of the street? Okay...okay... -Give the phone. Hey, she is saying, note it. -Tell me, mam. Brother, don't keep serving alcohol. He will flatten for water. Is it? Then, it's your wish. Why are his hands trembling? Would he be a tippler? Brother, think well and decide. The blow from the tall man still hurts. When he started drinking, we too yearned. We wished we could get it too. Go get one more bottle. Boss, shall I get for me too? Go, else I'll buy phenyl and wash your trap. Take the vehicle. Go where I say. Is it compulsory to go? Go... Hey, take left...go left... Hey, if you don't listen me, I'll stab you. Stab me...stab me... Already someone stabbed me, you too do it. Come on, stab me. Whatever happens, whoever dies, even if you die, I'll not spare him. Should I die? It's me who is threatening you, right? Keep quiet...keep quiet... Do you know who is Ammukutty? Ammukutty? Do you know who is Ammukutty? He separated her from me and stopped my marriage... ...if I can get hold of him, I will fiercely stab him. Hey, stop the vehicle aside. I'll get down and flee. It's you who came along. Now you say that you'll leave me. Will everyone leave me halfway? Tell me...tell me... Don't you feel furious to stab him? Hey, drive carefully... there comes a vehicle... Will you be with me? -Yes, I will. Vehicle....vehicle... You mean raw stuff? This is unfair. This is fair to me. If not, just leave. I can, serve it. It's done. I'll go now and come back. Brother, just a drop is pungent. How is he drinking? You're just a boozer, but he is a drunken master. Give my money now. You have to do one more task. I can't do, give me the money. I can't give. Do whatever you can. Take the juice. Are you kidding? Hey, give my money. Oh, no!

Hey, get down...get down... Hey, stand here... You catched him all alone, well done. Come... Very brave. Thank you. Are you married? No. -For me too. For me too. It was my fault that I stayed silent when talking bad about your work. No work is easy and not cheap. I'm sorry. You'd have told me this earlier. Hey, boss! Didn't I tell you he'd have kept in this. Had you heed me, wouldn't have got blows. You've become my boss, else... This is for damaging my petticoat. I can give discount for tearing my vest, definitely not for petticoat. He tore my diary, it's like tearing my heart. Petticoat Raja is better but the groom hit our boss on the mouth with his scepter. Finally, everything was settled. What else, take your job and go happily. No, sir. Already we didn't take money from the usurer and Madhavi. Yes, we must get money from her. Shall I drive to their house? I'll bang you. Just cutting for you till the end. Hey, who is that not noticing the vehicle? Hey, driving a wrecked vehicle, do you think you're in a jet? Can't you come slowly? Who are you talking with? I'll not spare you, come. Do you know who am I? -Who? I'm a kick-boxing champion. Will you fight with me? -No, dear. Dear! -Shall I hit you once? Wait, you too... -Everyone knows an art and take on me. Boss, come and handle this. I can't get down, let me see from here. If I slap you, your cheeks will tear apart. Praise the lord! Who are you scolding? Do you know who he is? He is the deity for all drunkards. He is my teacher who first taught me to booze. It's because of him, my life has fluorished. Will you booze? -He is the ladder who lifted me. No, that's long back. He is Madhi's father. Father! Yes, I'll keep saying there is a count, isn't it? This is the count. -Oh! What are you doing here at odd hours, dad? Going for a long drive with your step-mom. Look, oldie is going for a long drive when the last drive is due. Madhi, give me that jacket. Hey, the jacket is left out for night drive effect, give me. Father is asking, right? Take it off and give him. It'll be awesome to me, isn't it? God, all these days you were furious. Now you've shown your kindness. Boss, come and take it. Boss, I think it's the stolen money. Let's give it to the cops. It seems you'll deal with international range. Don't be too honest. Myself and my vehicle can't tolerate anymore. Hey, what's this money about? Dad, I'll say you all that later. First, you take the vehicle and leave. Okay, I'm leaving, brother. Take care of him. I sense something is wrong. Look, don't think too much. You got this money for some reason. We have helped you for a gratitude. Join the job with this money. Take it. Why are you adamant to join the same job? Even if you join, will they trust you anymore? Won't they keep watching when will you commit mistake next? Brother, shall I stop at bhai shop? As you wish, brother. How long it has been talking like this? I feel my life turned normal now. Sir, shall I shoot? Shall I shoot? Sir... Hey, I have to take my father to the hospital. I need ten thousand rupees. Sir, there is no money. Oh, no! No money... Oh, then why are you standing here? I'm here and telling you all since you shouldn't waste your time. This world is blessed because of some good people like you. Take care, brother. Okay. -Take care, brother. We were devestated because we just thought we don't have a answer... But we haven't anyone in the country that could help us. He was creating so much alcohol for so long literally attacked his pancreas. It's enough....enough... We shouldn't be good in life. You're right, my son. Though how many times you get married... ...all women are the same. Send parcel to her. Shall we enjoy? Come on.
