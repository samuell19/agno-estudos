When the 10 original commandments were the accepted laws of every civilized country and nation on the face of the globe. When those who prayed on their knees in church on Sunday did not go back to their homes to prey on their neighbors the remaining six days of the week. When religion was practiced with unfalse solemnity and honest sincerity. And when soul salvation was a heritage from heaven to not merely a few thousand, but to many millions. Those days are almost gone from the earth.

She sure don't, Miss Ellerby, but I think she's been worried 'cause Razz didn't come see her get baptized. Wasn't he here? No, he came past my house early this morning with a gun on his shoulder. Said he was going hunting. Mm-mm... and on a Sunday too. --obedience to the Savior's command and upon profession of your faith, I now baptize you, my sister, in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost. Mrs. Jenkins, I just can't get over Razz Jackson going hunting today and his wife's being baptized. They just been married three months. They sure have. But, oh, excuse me a minute, Sister Ellerby, but I got to go here and take her this robe so she won't catch a cold. Yes, yes, yes. Go right ahead, Sister Jenkins. (group singing) Snake! It's all right, brother. There! I see a snake! Keep quiet, brother. Man, you see that snake there. You see that snake, don't you? There's a snake, I tell you! You don't see that snake? Snake!

You're welcome. Razz Jackson, did you have any luck? Oh, uh, not much, Sister Jenkins. Just a couple of rabbits, that's all. Oh, they're big ones too, ain't they? I bet they sure is fat. Oh, they ain't so fat, Mrs. Jenkins. I mean, they ain't as fat as they look. They just look that way 'cause they's in that sack. No, ma'am, them rabbits ain't that fat. No, ma'am. Boy, these rabbits bound to be fat, heavy as this sack is. Let me see. Look out there, Mrs. Jenkins. That nail ain't very strong. It's liable to pull out. Uh-- wait a minute. I'll hang it over here against the wall, you know. Well, I guess I better be going, Brother Jackson. Thank you, thank you, Mrs. Jenkins. Thank you very much for looking after Martha, thank you. You're welcome, son. ** Razz! What is it, honey? Whose hogs is it you got in that sack? Uh, they, uh-- well, they ain't nobody's, honey. Them's wild hogs. They don't belong to nobody. Now, Razz Jackson. You know there ain't no wild hogs in them woods. Every hog out there belongs to somebody. I guess you're right, honey. But you know, we didn't have a thing to eat in this house. And if I hadn't been lucky enough to run up on them two, surely you wouldn't have had nothing to eat for supper tonight. Lord have mercy. Sister Ellerby, come in. Won't you have a seat? No, Sister Jenkins, I just thought I'd come by to tell you Luke Willis almost broke up the baptizing after you left. What, again? Yes-- last year he saw an alligator. This year it was a snake. (chuckles) I say it was the devil both times. I do too. Say, Sister Jenkins, what'd you do about Sister Jackson? My gracious, child, listen. (whispering) Sure enough, Sister Jenkins? Yes, ma'am. I had both hands right on them. Mmm, mmm, mmm. Razz? What you want now, honey? Why don't you try to pray and get religion? We could be so much happier if you would. Okay, honey, I'll try.

If it's the Lord's will for her to stay, she'll stay and if it's the Lord's will for her to go, she'll go. (group) In the mercy of the Lord. He sure is taking it hard, ain't he, Sister Jenkins? He sure is. But she ain't got a chance, Sister Ellerby. How come? The doctor said the bullet went clean through her and then come out through this picture over here. It sure did. Come on, sisters and brothers. Let us kneel down and pray. Our Father, Who art in Heaven, we bow down before You this evening to pray for one of Your children-- Sister Martha Ann Jackson. (group) Yes. Lord, Sister Martha Ann is a brand-new soldier of the Cross. Lord, yes. She ain't had time to buckle on a sword and go out in the battlefield and fight. Oh, no. We needs her, Lord! We sure do, Lord. We needs her down here amongst us. Oh, we need her. Although her husband, Brother Razz Jackson, has strayed from the path of righteousness all his life. Yes, Lord. He needs her too. He sure does. Now this evening, our Heavenly Father, we bow down before Your throne of grace, asking You to come down into this vale of sorrows and make Sister Martha Ann well again. Lord, we know that You and only You can pull the misery from this pain-wracked body. Yes, Lord. We know, Lord, that You and only You can come down and drive her miseries away. Yes, Lord. We know, Lord, that You and only You can drive the sin from Brother Razz Jackson's heart. Yes, Lord. And make him see the light. Yes, Lord. Please, Lord. Please, Lord. Please. Please. Come down and make Sister Martha Ann well again. Yes. We ask these blessings in the name of the Father and Your Son who died on the cross and the Holy Ghost, forever, amen. Amen.

Here, all is silent save for the mummers of grief and the muffled sobbing of those who have long since departed from among the living. But why do they mourn? They mourn because their efforts are yet unrewarded. Because the unjust have struck down the good and the unselfish. Because sin is enthroned in the seat of power. These were all good people. They came to the earth bringing love and truth and were hated in return. They came to teach the Gospel and were treated with scorn. They came bringing redemption and were stoned and crucified. Oh, that the children of men should be so blind. Yet, it has ever been so that the righteous have been treated with contempt and almost driven from the face of the earth. But they have not died in vain. Each succeeding generation has built monuments to their memory. Look there and there and there. These monuments are the treasures of the human race. Slowly, the human race moves forward, but it does move forward. Yes. But why have you brought me here? Is this the end of the trail for me? No. There is no place for you here yet. Come with me. ** That road leads to the highway of life. There at the crossroads you will find that which you seek. The road to the right leads to happiness and eternal life. The road to the left leads to death, hell and destruction. Be on your way, but walk clear of temptation and beware of the hypocrites and the false prophets-- go. (silent) There she goes. You know what to do. Okay, Judas. Go ahead. Do your stuff. (laughing wildly) (gasps painfully) Ah... (gasps) Really beautiful, isn't it? I didn't mean to frighten you. Green is my name. Judas Green. And yours? My name is Martha Ann Jackson. Beautiful name, but not half as beautiful as the one that owns it. And you know, I've got something right here in this bag that'll make you even more lovely. Now, isn't that a gorgeous thing? Here, take it. Take it. You'll be needing something like that in the city. And look, here are shoes to match it. And just to think, they're your size and they are all yours too. (angel) Be not overanxious for what you shall put on. Life is a more wonderful gift than clothing for the body. Why, in the city, a girl would be a queen with those on. And you know, you've got to wear clothes. The law says so. (angel) Your Heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. Go ahead and keep them. They don't cost you anything. (angel) Sell not your soul for the raiment of a peacock. Seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you. Now, wouldn't you look funny in the city with nothing on but that nightgown?
