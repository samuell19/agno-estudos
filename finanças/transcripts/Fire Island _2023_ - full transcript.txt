(Gloria sighs) - All right, my love, I hate to do this, but I really need to finish this proposal. - Come on. I miss you and I didn't get dressed up for no reason. - God, babe, this is so fucking tempting right now, but I'm gonna have to take a rain check. - I just wish you came out to the island. I really miss you. - I miss you, too. At least you have the beach. - A beach with no one on it. Oh, I totally forgot to tell you. Troy is out here, and we're gonna get a drink this weekend. - Jealous. Well, I have to get back to work. I love you, you beautiful fucking psycho. (laughs) - Yeah, yeah, yeah. I love you too. Goodnight, baby. - Goodnight. (lips smacking) Night. (cell phone pings) (Becca sighs) (cell phone keys clicking) (ominous music) (Becca sighs) (Becca yawns) - Oh, shit.

Answer your damn text. (scoffs) All right, well, get your shit packed 'cause we're gonna be there in two hours, okay? - Mm. I don't, I can't. - [Maria] No. No, no, no and no. You are not bitching out again. Get your ass out of bed, eat something like a normal person and be ready in two hours, got it? - Okay. - Oh, and make sure to pack something sexy. I have a friend who might be there and I think you guys would be- - Maria. I'm not meeting another one of your friends in the middle of a fucking pandemic. - [Maria] No, this isn't an option. I won't let you in the car until I see something sexy in your suitcase. - Bye. (Troy sighs) (soft tense music) (Troy groans) (soft tense music continues) (sink water running) (Troy sighs) (soft tense music continues) (lighter clicks) (Troy inhales) (Troy coughs) (Troy inhaling) (Troy sighs) Hey. - [Sam] Hi. - Gonna...

It's really good to see you. - It's good to see you, too, Sam. - Okay, so, welcome to your new pod. It's, um, we've all been like incredibly safe, we haven't left the house for literally months- - No, I trust you. It's... - Okay. Are you doing okay? - Good. - Yeah? - Yeah. - I just want you to know that I'm here for you. - [Troy] Okay, thanks. - Yeah. Can we? - Yeah, come here. - Okay. (birds chirping) - Oh wow, it feels pretty good to hug somebody. - [Sam] Right? (Troy sighs) - Hi. - Hi. - Wait, wait, wait. - What? - Let me see it. - Oh, the sex outfit, it's, it's the trunk, in the back. - Go get it, we're not leaving until I see it. - I saw it, it's incredibly sexy. He has it here. - It's very sexy. - Two nipples like headlights. - Okay, well you better not be lying to me. - Hey Troy. - Hi, Zoe. - Hi, hi. Have you met my boyfriend? - I don't think so. Hello. - This is Matt. He's amazing, he's a programmer. - [Troy] Awesome. - Troy's the one who did my website. - Oh. Very cool, what'd you use? Like C++ or? - Square, Squarespace. - Oh. - Whatever. It's all black magic sorcery to me. - Okay, let's go. - [Zoe] Oh my god, shut up. You're the one who wanted a whole runway show. (Maria cheers) - Fire Island bitches! (cheers) (upbeat electronic music) (upbeat electronic music continues) (upbeat electronic music continues) (upbeat electronic music continues) (birds chirping) - Hey. - Hm? - Wake up. You can't sleep all day. - Why? It's not like we need to be anywhere. - Sir, you do not get the luxury of sleep today. You left the door open again, the house was freezing. - What? - When you came back from smoking. You didn't close it, again. - Yes, I did. - Okay, then, why was it open? - Wind? I don't know. - Well let me see. Who was the last one out last night and who gets high all the time and forgets shit? Oh, I can't remember. I think his name is Bess or Chess or... Oh, okay. I can forgive you, if one condition is met. - Pancakes? - Pancakes. (Wes groans) - Hell yeah. (Sam laughs) We got the whole place to ourselves. - Oh, I was secretly hoping it'd be packed. I miss being in a crowd. - Oh, I know. Squeezing through sweaty bodies. Making out with strangers. - Catching the virus, dying slowly and horribly. - Okay, can we just forget about reality for just a few days? Like ban all talk of Trump and COVID? - [Sam] Yeah, done and done. - [Trump] The new headline is, "Trump asks people to go outside, that's dangerous." Here we go. Same old group. Are you ready? I hope people enjoy the sun. - God, can we please turn this off? I can't listen to this depressing news every morning, on my birthday. (Wes chuckles) - So, birthday boy. Anything you wanna do today? I want you to know, I really appreciate you coming back to the island. I know it wasn't easy for you. - Coming back is the first step to getting past things. Plus, it was like three years ago. Can you believe it? - And that fucker is at the bottom of the ocean. - So they say. - Joseph, baby, come on. You don't actually believe... They found his body. - A body. But could, could we just stop this? (Joseph sighs) I'm really, I'm fine. I uh, I'm just really happy to be here during this nightmare we're all living through, honest. A walk would be nice, and, uh, maybe, uh, make dinner? Find something on Netflix? - So what we've doing everyday since March? - Well yeah, but like a nice meal with wine and dessert. Like a good movie, something gay and fun. - You talkin' "Schindler's List," or "Apocalypse Now?" - I'm thinkin' "Mean Girls." (Joseph and Wes laugh) - Hey. What's up with that guy? - Ugh, his boyfriend killed himself just as lockdown started. He came home and saw him hanging in the living room. It's so fucked up. - Jesus. - I feel so bad for him. He's such a nice guy. His boyfriend, on the other hand? - What? - I mean, I shouldn't speak ill of the dead, but, I don't know, he had these crazy mood swings. Just never knew what you were gonna get. Doesn't surprise me what he did. (ominous music) (ominous music continues) (gentle music) - You found it? I thought they were sold out? - I have my ways. (gentle music continues) (upbeat electronic music) (upbeat electronic music continues) - Oh my god, Ron, look at that one. - Oh, so dramatic. - Okay, we get it. You're macabre. - Oh, these masks are getting crazy the longer the thing drags on. Before you know it, you'll have a couple of guys in hazmat suits and assless chaps. - Eh, I saw that on the ferry last week. (men laughing) (upbeat electronic music) (ominous music) (footsteps thudding) - Jesus! - It's not safe anymore, son. Not safe, you gotta get outta here. - I need you to not touch me, okay, okay? Just back off. - Shake my hand. - Hey. - Shake my hand and go. Leave. - I'm going. - Hey. - Leave, leave. - Thank you. Thank you. Jesus, fuck. - [Sam] Who was that? Are you okay? - [Troy] I don't fucking know, I'm not okay. Jesus. - [Sam] Did that guy touch you at all? - He touched all of me. This is, this is beautiful. How did you get this place? - My guncle owns it. He's a doctor. He's been working at the hospital 24/7 and he told me I could come out whenever I wanted to. - Guncle. What are you, like 14? - [Zoe] Uh, I'm more like 24? - [Maria] Wait, why the hell is the door open? - Girl, it's Fire Island. Everything is open. - [Maria] What the hell is this place? - This is the living room. Fireplace, couches, and that shag carpet is perfect for fucking on. Not that I've ever done that, just, I would imagine so. There's the pool and plenty of places to chill outside, although it's May so it's probably gonna get cold once the sun goes down. Oh, and your bedrooms are front of the house is a queen and up there are the rest of the beds. Come on. (footsteps thudding) (soft tense music) Wait until you guys see the upstairs. You guys can fight over who gets this one. - Ooh. Dibs. - [Sam] Oh, god. (Zoe laughs) (soft tense music continues) - This is my room. (Zoe sighs) - Really? - Mm-hm. (Matt sighs) Oh, and uh, there's another room downstairs. It's kinda isolated, but it is the biggest, so. - Would you guys rather? - No, we're good. - All right. - You want it? All right, let's go. - Oh, great. It's very nice. - Get cozy. (soft tense music continues) (Troy exhales) (soft tense music continues) (upbeat electronic pop music) - Ooh. Come on, Matt, your girl is shaking her ass for you. Ooh. Get up, what the hell are you doing? (upbeat electronic pop music continues) There you go. Ow-ow! (upbeat electronic pop music continues) Okay, now we don't need all that. (soft tense music) (animal vocalizes in the distance) (ominous music) - [Sam] Are you okay? - Uh... Yeah. Uh, I just thought I saw like a- - A deer? - Yeah, I- - Yeah. The island's like crawling with them. They're really cute, though. You can like go up and pet 'em. It's hilarious. - Sure. Right. (birds chirping) - Okay. So talk to me. (Troy sighs) - So yesterday I tried to see if I could spend an entire day in bed without getting up, and other than having to pee, I did. - Wow, wow, wow. You didn't eat? - I had some Doritos and then there was a half drunk mug of coffee on my nightstand, so. - You know, um... Talking to friends might help. If you don't want to- - No, it's... (birds chirping) If I tell you something, then can it just stay between us and then, like, I just would like to go back to the weekend and act like things are fucking normal. - Yeah, absolutely. I love that. - So the day before I found Jaden, I'd broken up with him. You know, we were fighting everyday. I didn't know what else to do. And I'd become this, like, this caretaker for him and I know that sounds super fucked up because he was a really good person and, and, and it's not his fault, I just... (melancholy music) - I'm so sorry. I wish that I knew what to say. (cell phone pings) (Troy sighs) Who's that? - Oh, that's, it's Becca. She wants me to come by. She's actually down on the island. She wants me to come by for like a drink or, I don't know, but if she ever stops working. Fucking lesbians. (Sam laughs) - Yes. Okay. Well, speaking of drinks. - Yeah. Oh, also, um, Maria doesn't actually have a friend that she's gonna try and hook me up with, does- - No, she does. - She does? - She does. - Goddammit. - She does. - Every time. - I know. - It's such a disaster. - I know it's a disaster. I tried to tell her not to, but she wouldn't listen. - Man, I shouldn't have come. - Please don't say that. It was really important for me that you were here because I really missed you. (Sam inhales) (Same exhales) And who knows, maybe getting a one night stand isn't the worst thing in the world. - Okay, sure, I'll get laid and then I can immediately drop dead with COVID. - You're not gonna die of COVID. We're too young to die. - Okay. - But your grandma. (Troy laughs) (Sam laughs) She sucks, right? - You're terrible. You are canceled. (Sam laughs) Fuck. I did, I really, I did miss you, too. - Aye yi yi yi. Okay. I hereby pour this libation to summon forth the very, very, very fun spirit of my old best friend Troy. - You already poured the libation. - I'm pouring more libation- - Okay, enough, enough. Please, please, enough. You're gonna spill it. Thank you. - You're welcome. And also... - Oh, Lord. - What are those? - This is gonna be good for you. I promise. - That's it? - Yep. - That's all I get? - That's all you get. - Okay. (chuckles) Oh, yep. (glasses clink) - Clink. (soft romantic music) (Wes and Joseph breathing heaviLy) - One sec. - No. - No, hold on. I gotta pee. - Oh. (Wes chuckles) (Joseph sighs) - Fine. Fine, I'll go have a look at that moon you keep going on about. - Do it, it's gorgeous. (soft romantic music continues) - Oh, it looks like crap. (ominous music) (rustling in the distance) Wes? (insects buzzing) Wes? (insects buzzing) You all right? You're blowing up that bathroom again? What's wrong with your stomach? (insects buzzing) Wes? (knife slices) (dramatic music) (blood trickling) (water splashes) (electronic music) - Oh, guys, it's become grotesque. Come on. - At least we're not like- - Hey! - These nasties. Y'all are nasty, and you're making Troy feel sad. - No, no, not sad. Just disgusted. - Sorry, Troy. Come on, let's go. Be right back. (Troy sighs) - Okay, so what's the plan? - Ooh, so I'm waiting to hear back from my friend who works at the Ice Palace. He said if a table opens up, he'll save it for us. - Is that safe? - They are super limited capacity. They're being really careful. - I don't know, dude. It only takes one person to kill you. - Oh my gosh, no, ew, shut up. We are not gonna die. - [Sam] Troy, what do you think? - I don't wanna be the killjoy, so. (cell phone pings) - Ooh, that is probably him. Yep, he said there will be a table ready in 30 minutes. Are we going? - Are we? (Zoe moaning) (soft electronic music) (Zoe continues moaning) (soft electronic music) - Yeah, we are not missing our table for this. (banging on wall) Chop, chop, let's go. - [Zoe] What the fuck, Maria? Get out! (chair thuds) - You missed. (gentle music) Down this lonely road - Hey, you are Troy, right? - Yeah, hi. - I'm Jacob, Maria's friend. - Oh, right. Nice to meet you. - Can I buy you a drink? - I actually just um, I just ordered one. It's right here, so. - 12 bucks. - Okay. - Listen, I get it. No problem. - Thanks, sorry. Okay. As you fade away into yesterday Here I stand alone And I wait (ominous music) - Troy. - Zoe. - Can you sing for us? - No. - I haven't heard you sing in so long and I miss it so much. - I don't, I'm okay. I'm good, I promise. - Please, come on. - No, I just wanna sit here and sort of stare into the glass, you know? - Oh, who is that hot man there? - No, no, no, no. No, no, no, it's not about- - He's looking at you, bitch. Ow-ow! - Please, I just, I just wanna have a nice, quiet night with- - Uh, well, all the more reasons to do it. - To do what? - Let that man suck your dick.

They were both raped. We're not sure if it was before, or after. And one thing. You're gonna wanna see this. (tense dramatic music) And we got no prints, Jack. - You're saying the killer was staying here? - We think. - What about security cameras? - They'd all been cut. - So you're telling me you ain't got any leads? - I'm thinkin' maybe this has something to do with the murder at the Pines a few years ago? The body that washed up on shore, it was never identified. Who's to say the killer isn't still here? - All right, you know what we gotta do? We gotta keep this under wraps for now. - This is a small island, Jack. - Exactly. And this guy could be close and we got a chance at nailing him if it doesn't go all over the news, all right? We can't have this island gettin' all hysterical. - People are already talkin'. - All right, you know what you tell 'em? If anybody asks, you say it was a GHB overdose. - GHB? - Happens every summer. They won't think twice about it, all right? Go do your job. (tense dramatic music) Santino. If you hear anything, I wanna be the first to know about it, all right? (tense dramatic music) (police radio chatter) (tense dramatic music continues) - Let's go straight, somewhere. - There's trees. - We get to see trees, guys. Be excited. - I love trees. - I love trees, too. (Sam humming) - [Maria] Oh god, I feel sick. I don't remember the last time I was this hungover. - [Zoe] I know, but we're getting old. (soft tense music) - Troy. - What? - Come on. - I'm comin'. I'll get there. - [Sam] Okay. (Troy humming) (soft tense music) (dramatic music) (Troy humming) (soft tense music) (dramatic music) - Oh my god. Fuck. - Look at my old friend. - Look, man, I don't wanna get killed, okay? - Lonely here, isn't it? - Yep. - Look at those fuckin' deer. Always watchin'. Waitin'. - [Troy] They're uh, yeah, they're great. - It's too quiet here. Even the raven himself is hoarse that croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan under my battlements. - My friends are right over there. - Come ye spirits that dwell on mortal thoughts and sex me here and fill me from crown to toe, top full of direst cruelty. You shouldn't be here, son. (birds chirping) (Murph whistling) - Fuck you, man. Jesus. Hey! (soft electronic pop music) And he did that, like, the Batman thing, you know? Where he's there and then- - I love the Batman thing. - Like, have you actually seen someone do it, though? It's really disturbing. - Really? - Yeah. People aren't supposed to move that fast. - Hey, friends. Is tonight the night? - [Zoe] You had molly this whole time? - Hell yes I did. - Well bring it out. What are we doing? - [Troy] Is it, um, what's it like? - Excuse me? What's it like? Troy, it's fucking incredible, especially sex. - [Troy] Oh, well... - Or masturbation. - Great. Cool, while y'all are havin' mind blowing sex, I'll just be masturbating. (all laughing) - There's nothing wrong with a little self care. - Oh, and the showers are awesome, too. Ugh, I took one alone once and I was in the shower for like two hours. - Did you masturbate? - Uh, obviously. I have a hand. - All right. Okay. - Yes. Shove it in, shove it in. - Down the hatch. - You just, fuckin'- - Mm-hm. Mm-hm. - Okay. (Maria and Zoe laughing) - Yes! - There we go. (tense dramatic music) - [Officer] Dispatch, show car two on scene. (tense dramatic music continues) - What do you got? - [Detective Santino] Major contusions to the head, chest and torso. Most likely an ax. Looks like she was raped, too. - Any other prints? - [Detective Santino] Only hers. - She lived alone? - [Detective Santino] Yeah. - Looks like somebody was lying here. Spent the night. Could be our guy. Hey. (fingers snap) Give me this. Take this, lock it down. Nobody in, nobody out, all right? - You got it, boss. - Jack. - What? (tense dramatic music continues) - We can't keep thus under wraps much longer. - Like you said, it's a small island, all right? Let's stick to our plan. - The families, they're gonna be notified. - Well when that happens, I'll deal with it. We're gonna catch this guy, all right? He's sloppy, he's making mistakes. What? - [Officer] Boss, we need you back at the headquarters. We'll run over it. - Santino, just do your job. Do your job. (tense dramatic music continues) (ominous music) (Zoe laughs) (all laughing) - Just stop it. Stop. (Troy sighs) Thanks for inviting me. - I kind of forced you to come. - Yeah, you did. You did, but, I'm lucky to have a friend who forces me to, like, take care of myself. - Yeah, we do that for each other. - I felt really guilty, and I've just kind of been by myself a lot, you know? (Troy sighs) But I swear, I feel like I can breathe and, uh, (chuckles) this weekend was the last fuckin' thing I wanted to do, but, I'm really happy I came. I just sorta love you. (Sam laughs) Oh, mm. - Thank you so much. (gentle music) (waves sloshing) My friend. - My friend. - My friend. - Where are you taking me? - My friend, let's go! - Oh no, we're running. (Sam screams) We're running! (Sam screaming) (gentle music) (Troy exhales) Oh, hey, Zoe? Hey, Zoe? - Mm? - Zoe? Could you, could you hit this, please? (Zoe scoffs) Thank you very much. - No, it's gonna be so fuckin' romantic. The sunrise, the waves. Don't you think so, Troy? Wouldn't you like to have sex on the beach? - [Troy] No. - Yeah, I mean... - I'm fucking you on the beach. It's happening. - We can discuss it. - Uh, I'm making coffee, geez. - [Troy] Okay. That's it, I'm going to bed. - Yeah, we're gonna go upstairs, I think. - Yeah, yeah, I know. Everybody's fuckin'! Woo! (Maria laughs) (Troy grunts) (light clicks) (soft ominous music) (Sam grunts) - Come here. (Sam laughs) (ominous music) - Okay, wait, wait. - Come on, babe. - No, no, no, no. Babe, babe. Hey, babe, I love you but- - We stayed up all night. We're gonna do this. Come on. (Matt sighs) (Zoe grunts) (Zoe moaning) (waves sloshing) (ominous music) (ax thuds) (ax thuds) (blood splatters) (muffled whimpering) (ax thuds) (blood splatters) (Zoe sobbing) (tense dramatic music) (waves sloshing) (tense dramatic music) (Troy sighs) (birds chirping) (Troy exhales) (Troy groans) (ominous music) (Troy grunts) (ominous music continues) (birds chirping) - Hey, Sam? (ominous music continues) (electronic music) (shower water pattering) (electronic music continues) (gentle music) Yo, who's on my speaker? Come on, guys, who... From our history Down this lonely road - Guys! You take my heart away (rock ballad music) Here I stand alone - Where the fuck is my shirt? (ominous music) Hey, guys? Sam? (Sam grumbles) Um, did you try connecting to my speaker? - [Sam] What? No. - I, yeah, nevermind. Sorry. (ominous music continues) Hey, Zoe? Zoe? (ominous music continues) - Are they out there? - No. - They said that they were gonna go to the beach a couple hours ago. - I know. - Okay, fine, hold on. Let me just... - Thank you. Thanks. Sorry. (ominous music continues) (insects buzzing) (ominous music continues) Is there, um, is there another spot on the island that, that they'd go to? - Nothing was open. - Well, I mean, just like, um... - You know what? Maybe she texted me. I don't know where the fuck I put my phone. You know what? I mean, they probably went to the beach to walk. I mean they've only been gone for what? Like... - Like six hours. - Oh, hold on. Zoe. "I had to take Matt to the hospital." - Oh my god. - What? - Is she kidding? - If she's texting, I'm just gonna call her. - [Operator] The person you are calling is using a screening service. - She screened my call. - That fuckin' weird. - 'Cause why would she text you and then not pick up my call? - But they got to the hospital and then decide to text me now? - What if we have to fucking quarantine? - No, that wouldn't happen because if it was COVID, she would have said something, right? - Yeah. - I mean it's Zoe. - [Troy] What do you want me to ask her? - Ask her if Matt's okay. - Ask her if we have to fuckin' quarantine. - Hold on, um... And, okay, send. She's typing. Um... "It's definitely not COVID, but I'll be back tonight. My phone's gonna die, XO." - Typical Zoe. - She fuckin' flaked. - She fucking flaked. - This is Burning Man. - This is Burning Man. - Wow. - Yeah. (Troy sighs) - I mean, it's her house. - It's her car. (ominous music) (animals vocalizing) (ominous music continues) You haven't heard anything? - No. I mean, she did say her phone was gonna die, but like, my texts aren't even going through. - Where the fuck is it? Ugh. You try calling it again, Sam. - Babe, I have called your phone like 10 times, okay? It probably fell out on the boardwalk or I don't fucking know. - No I had it here last night. We were playing music off of it, do you not remember? - Yeah, I remember, so that must mean it's on silent or it's dead, babe. It's, it's gonna show up 'cause it literally always does. - It's not, though, so unless you're gonna help me find it, it doesn't fucking matter. I have a raging fucking headache and this isn't helping, obviously, so good fucking night. - [Sam] Hey. Where are you going? - I am going to sleep. - It's 9:00 PM, come one, we haven't even had dinner yet. - All I want is to find my phone and to go to sleep and seeing as how finding my phone isn't a fuckin' option, especially because you two aren't doing absolute shit, (chuckles) I'm going to do the latter. I'm going to take a Xanax and neither of you are invited to join me. - [Sam] Okay. - [Maria] Thanks a lot. Thanks a lot, Troy, yeah. Big help, thanks. (Troy scoffs) - Okay, goodnight sweetie. - [Maria] Yeah, whatever. - You okay? - Yeah, are you hungry? - Yes. - Yeah, let's go eat a sandwich. - Okay, a sandwich. It's weird seeing so many dark houses. - Yeah. - We're the only ones here. - I know. Yeah, it makes sense no one's here 'cause the bars are all closed and everything. - Yeah, I guess. - What are they gonna do- - What are they gonna do? Hang out with us? (Sam laughs) Hey, is Maria okay? 'Cause I feel like I made that situation- - No, that was- - Much worse. - Absolutely not you. She's... She's fine. It's just... It's been... I, eh... - Eh? - It's been tense. It's been tense. - Are you okay? - Yeah. - Yeah? - I'm completely fine, thank you. - I've just, I've never seen her get that aggressive like that. - Yeah. - I don't know. It just was, um (sniffles) it was weird. Sorry, I don't mean like, I'm not judging or anything, I just, it just was- - No. - It was just different. - No, yeah. And again, I'm sorry that you had to be part of that. - [Troy] It was kind of awesome. (Sam chuckles) (sink water running) (ominous music) (Maria sighs) (pills rattling) (ominous music continues) (Maria sighs) (ominous music continues) (lights click) (lights click) (lights clicking) (ominous music continues) - Sam? (lights click) Sam, what are you doing? (ominous music continues) (footsteps thudding) (dramatic music) Wh- (Maria screams) (Maria grunting) (flesh squelching) (Maria yells) (Maria coughs) - No, I'm telling you, it's not anything that was red. - Okay. - No strawberries or raspberries. - Oh raspberries, sad. - Yeah, I missed raspberries badly. He wouldn't even eat beef unless it had been cooked before he saw it. - Holy shit. - Holy shit. - Holy shit. - Yeah. Dinner was always an ordeal. Dessert was an ordeal. We couldn't eat M&M's. - You love M&M's. (Troy chuckles) It's really nice to hear you talk about him. - I miss him. - Yeah. (cell phone ringing) - Is it? - It's my beloved. Hi, Maria. Where did you find your phone, Maria? Maria? (Troy chuckles) - It's the service. She has one of the shit companies, right? - She does. (Troy laughs) (phone line trilling) Hi. Sweetie pie. - Honey, honey boo boo? - Honey baby. No? Nothing? No, she hung up. - Oh, good. That's progress. - Maria? You left the fuckin' door open again. Hello? - She's probably asleep. - You're right. She probably took another fuckin' Xanax. (Troy sighs) - Thank you. - Yes. (Troy grunts) - I'm not saying thank you again. (Sam laughs) What? - I should go check on Maria. - Yeah, go. (footsteps thudding) - Maria? (ominous music) Maria? (ominous music continues) - Hey, um, Zoe's outside. (door opens) (ominous music continues) - Hey, Maria? (thudding in the distance) (ominous music continues) - Sam! Sam, um, Zoe told me she was outside, but there's nobody there. - Maria's not upstairs. - What? Where's my... Where's my phone? - [Sam] What do you mean where's your phone? - It was here and... - [Sam] Where, where the fuck is my phone? - Um, I don't wanna be here. I wanna leave. - Okay, wait a minute. - [Troy] I wanna leave here, Sam. I don't feel safe. - Where are you gonna go? - Where the fuck are our phones, then? - I don't know. Let's take a sec- - I, I don't, I don't wanna be here. (water trickling) (ominous music) I swear, if there's nobody in here, then I'm just gonna start banging on people's doors because... Well we have to talk to somebody and I don't... Okay, look, the light's on. Great. Let's uh... Okay, so- - Okay. "Due to the pandemic, we are closed." - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I see. We're just gonna go in and ask to use the phone and then we'll be out. - I don't know, dude. - It's not a big deal. (ominous music) Look, they got the power running. That fountain's fucking on. It's something. Okay. Um... Please be open, come on. Great. Hello? Hi, excuse us? Hello? (ominous music) The light was up there. - Yep. (ominous music continues) Wow. - Yeah. Hello? (Troy sighs) (ominous music continues) That door is open. - [Sam] Yeah. (ominous music continues) (metallic clanging) (Sam gasps) - What the fuck was that? Was that upstairs? - I think that was upstairs. (ominous music continues) - Hello? Hey, sorry, hello? Fuck. There's nobody up here. - Oh, shit. I don't think there's a caretaker here, dude. I think, I think somebody's squatting. - Yeah. (Sam exhales) (ominous music continues) - Huh. I can see our house from here. Troy? (ominous music continues) - We have to go. We have to go. - Why? - That's my fucking shirt. Just go. - Your shirt? - Yeah. - Why are we running? - Just keep near me closely. Just keep near me. (tense dramatic music) Come on. Hurry, hurry. (tense dramatic music continues) Yesterday, while I was taking a shower, I got back to the room and my fucking shirt was off the bed, okay? And then when we got to that, that fuckin' attic, it was in that sleeping bag. My shirt was in that person's room. - What? - So they came into the house and they took it and now the phones are gone and, and Maria and Zoe are fucking gone and I don't know where they are. - Take a deep breath, okay? - So some, some motherfucker is fucking with us. - Okay. - And I don't, I don't, like, I don't wanna be here. I wanna get on the next fucking ferry. I wanna fucking leave this place. - Okay, that's fine. - Okay? - Yep, this is very, very scary. - Yeah, I know, I- - Hey, hey, just breathe. - I don't need to be calmed down, I need to find a phone. - We're gonna find a phone. We're finding a phone. - Okay. - We'll go back to the restaurant and we'll find a phone. - Which way is the restaurant? I don't know where we are. - It's this way. I'm pretty sure that it's this way, just- (dramatic music) - Fuck, go, run. (Troy and Sam panting) (dramatic music continues) Go! (Troy and Sam panting) (dramatic music continues) Lock the doors, get knives! Knives! (Sam panting) (dramatic music continues) - What the fuck? - Shh. - Shh. - I don't see him. I don't see him. (Troy panting) Okay. (Troy mumbles) - Backyard. Backyard. (Troy panting) (door creaking) (Sam breathing heavily) - Sam. Sam. Whoa! (Sam gasps) Sam, run! (flesh squelching) No! (Sam gasps) (flesh squelching) (blood spurting) (Troy panting) (tense dramatic music) (Troy grunts) (Troy panting) (tense dramatic music) (Troy panting) (tense dramatic music continues) (Troy panting) (tense dramatic music) (dramatic music) (ax thuds) (Troy grunts) - Hey, Melissa. What's going on? (flags rustling) I thought the Belvedere was closed. (flags rustling) I'm on it. (gentle music) Down this lonely road You walk away from me From our history (upbeat piano music) You take my heart away (Troy coughing) (Troy panting) - Help, help, help. Help! Help me! Help! No, no! - Hey. It's me. (laughs) Remember? Sorry about the straps. I tried to keep 'em lose for you. I'm building a family. No more isolation. I fucking hate this isolation! But now I have a family. And you. Boop. (Troy gasps) Yeah, I did what I had to do for us to be together. Okay, so neither of us would ever have to be alone again. After I lost everyone that meant everything to me, I promised myself that I would never be alone again. I mean... I deserve that, right? And then this fucking pandemic hit and can't even go on Grindr these days without a fuckin' COVID test, am I right? Sorry. (Troy whimpers) Guess I shouldn't complain, though. Everyone seemed to forget I might still be alive after COVID hit. (Troy sobbing) That didn't change how lonely I became. And then I, I found you. And when I saw you, I knew. I knew that I had found someone that I could depend on, who had friends that I would actually wanna hang out with. (laughs) Crazy is that? - Please let me go. Please? (Rafael laughs) - Go? (Rafael laughs) Go where? (laughs) Back out to the pandemic? (laughs) No. You're much safer here with me. (kiss smacks) (Troy whimpers) (hit thuds) (bone cracks) - [Troy] Fuck! - I'm sorry about that. I really am. But it's the only way that we could be together. Have you seen what it's like out there? Just going outside is dangerous, okay? I can keep you safe and I can make you feel good. - Fuck you. - Do you have any idea how long I have waited for someone like you? Do you understand? (knocking on door) - [Troy] Help! Help! - Shh. (knocking on door) (ominous music) (door closes) (ominous music continues) (banging in the distance) (ominous music continues) (ominous music continues) (Troy gasps) - [Troy] Hey, hey. Please, help me. Help me. He's out there. - Oh, shit, oh, shit. - He's gonna kil me. - It's gonna be okay. Relax, just relax. Relax. - Ow, fuck! - Relax. - Ow! - [Troy] Oh, please, please. - [Detective Santino] Just relax. - Fuck! Hey, hey, he's- (ax thuds) (flesh squelches) (blood dripping) Fuck! (body thuds) (Troy panting) (tense dramatic music) (tense dramatic music continues) (door creaks) (ominous music) Help! (birds chirping) (Troy grunting) Help! Help! Somebody! (Troy grunting) (ominous music continues) (Troy panting) - [Rafael] Is it the mask? 'Cause I can take it off, babe! (Troy panting) (tense dramatic music) (tense dramatic music continues) (Troy grunts) (waves sloshing) - Hey! Hey! Help me! (tense dramatic music continues) (Troy panting) Help! - [Rafael] Come on home, babe. You don't have to run! Come on home, baby. - Fuck. Fuck. - You don't have to run. I love you. (Troy grunting) (Troy choking) (Rafael grunting) (Rafael laughing) (Rafael sighs) If I can't have you... No one can. (kiss smacks) (ominous music) (birds chirping) (waves sloshing) (ominous music continues) (ominous music continues) (birds chirping) (camera clicks) (ominous music continues) - A beach town reeling from the pandemic has been dealt a deadly blow after a series of gruesome murders at the hands of a serial killer were reported over the weekend. - Murder in the Pines.

I know you two fuckers aren't gonna say anything so I have to take charge yet again. How long has it been since we've all been together, you amazing fucking people? - Over a year, bitch. - Oh. - Yeah, over a year. - Oh, me. Oh no, cheers to that.

I really miss you. - I miss you, too. At least you have the beach. - A beach with no one on it. Oh, I totally forgot to tell you. Troy is out here, and we're gonna get a drink this weekend. - Jealous. Well, I have to get back to work. I love you, you beautiful fucking psycho. (laughs) - Yeah, yeah, yeah. I love you too. Goodnight, baby. - Goodnight. (lips smacking) Night. (cell phone pings) (Becca sighs) (cell phone keys clicking) (ominous music) (Becca sighs) (Becca yawns) - Oh, shit.

You are not bitching out again. Get your ass out of bed, eat something like a normal person and be ready in two hours, got it? - Okay. - Oh, and make sure to pack something sexy. I have a friend who might be there and I think you guys would be- - Maria. I'm not meeting another one of your friends in the middle of a fucking pandemic. - [Maria] No, this isn't an option. I won't let you in the car until I see something sexy in your suitcase. - Bye. (Troy sighs) (soft tense music) (Troy groans) (soft tense music continues) (sink water running) (Troy sighs) (soft tense music continues) (lighter clicks) (Troy inhales) (Troy coughs) (Troy inhaling) (Troy sighs) Hey. - [Sam] Hi. - Gonna...

It's really good to see you. - It's good to see you, too, Sam. - Okay, so, welcome to your new pod. It's, um, we've all been like incredibly safe, we haven't left the house for literally months- - No, I trust you. It's... - Okay. Are you doing okay? - Good. - Yeah? - Yeah. - I just want you to know that I'm here for you. - [Troy] Okay, thanks. - Yeah. Can we? - Yeah, come here. - Okay. (birds chirping) - Oh wow, it feels pretty good to hug somebody. - [Sam] Right? (Troy sighs) - Hi. - Hi. - Wait, wait, wait. - What? - Let me see it. - Oh, the sex outfit, it's, it's the trunk, in the back. - Go get it, we're not leaving until I see it. - I saw it, it's incredibly sexy. He has it here. - It's very sexy. - Two nipples like headlights. - Okay, well you better not be lying to me. - Hey Troy. - Hi, Zoe. - Hi, hi. Have you met my boyfriend? - I don't think so. Hello. - This is Matt. He's amazing, he's a programmer. - [Troy] Awesome. - Troy's the one who did my website. - Oh. Very cool, what'd you use? Like C++ or? - Square, Squarespace. - Oh. - Whatever. It's all black magic sorcery to me. - Okay, let's go. - [Zoe] Oh my god, shut up. You're the one who wanted a whole runway show. (Maria cheers) - Fire Island bitches! (cheers) (upbeat electronic music) (upbeat electronic music continues) (upbeat electronic music continues) (upbeat electronic music continues) (birds chirping) - Hey. - Hm? - Wake up. You can't sleep all day. - Why? It's not like we need to be anywhere. - Sir, you do not get the luxury of sleep today. You left the door open again, the house was freezing. - What? - When you came back from smoking. You didn't close it, again. - Yes, I did. - Okay, then, why was it open? - Wind? I don't know. - Well let me see. Who was the last one out last night and who gets high all the time and forgets shit? Oh, I can't remember. I think his name is Bess or Chess or... Oh, okay. I can forgive you, if one condition is met. - Pancakes? - Pancakes. (Wes groans) - Hell yeah. (Sam laughs) We got the whole place to ourselves. - Oh, I was secretly hoping it'd be packed. I miss being in a crowd. - Oh, I know. Squeezing through sweaty bodies. Making out with strangers. - Catching the virus, dying slowly and horribly. - Okay, can we just forget about reality for just a few days? Like ban all talk of Trump and COVID? - [Sam] Yeah, done and done. - [Trump] The new headline is, "Trump asks people to go outside, that's dangerous." Here we go. Same old group. Are you ready? I hope people enjoy the sun. - God, can we please turn this off? I can't listen to this depressing news every morning, on my birthday. (Wes chuckles) - So, birthday boy. Anything you wanna do today? I want you to know, I really appreciate you coming back to the island. I know it wasn't easy for you. - Coming back is the first step to getting past things. Plus, it was like three years ago. Can you believe it? - And that fucker is at the bottom of the ocean. - So they say. - Joseph, baby, come on. You don't actually believe... They found his body. - A body. But could, could we just stop this? (Joseph sighs) I'm really, I'm fine. I uh, I'm just really happy to be here during this nightmare we're all living through, honest. A walk would be nice, and, uh, maybe, uh, make dinner? Find something on Netflix? - So what we've doing everyday since March? - Well yeah, but like a nice meal with wine and dessert. Like a good movie, something gay and fun. - You talkin' "Schindler's List," or "Apocalypse Now?" - I'm thinkin' "Mean Girls." (Joseph and Wes laugh) - Hey. What's up with that guy? - Ugh, his boyfriend killed himself just as lockdown started. He came home and saw him hanging in the living room. It's so fucked up. - Jesus. - I feel so bad for him. He's such a nice guy. His boyfriend, on the other hand? - What? - I mean, I shouldn't speak ill of the dead, but, I don't know, he had these crazy mood swings. Just never knew what you were gonna get. Doesn't surprise me what he did. (ominous music) (ominous music continues) (gentle music) - You found it? I thought they were sold out? - I have my ways. (gentle music continues) (upbeat electronic music) (upbeat electronic music continues) - Oh my god, Ron, look at that one. - Oh, so dramatic. - Okay, we get it. You're macabre. - Oh, these masks are getting crazy the longer the thing drags on. Before you know it, you'll have a couple of guys in hazmat suits and assless chaps. - Eh, I saw that on the ferry last week. (men laughing) (upbeat electronic music) (ominous music) (footsteps thudding) - Jesus! - It's not safe anymore, son. Not safe, you gotta get outta here. - I need you to not touch me, okay, okay? Just back off. - Shake my hand. - Hey. - Shake my hand and go. Leave. - I'm going. - Hey. - Leave, leave. - Thank you. Thank you. Jesus, fuck. - [Sam] Who was that? Are you okay? - [Troy] I don't fucking know, I'm not okay. Jesus. - [Sam] Did that guy touch you at all? - He touched all of me. This is, this is beautiful. How did you get this place? - My guncle owns it. He's a doctor. He's been working at the hospital 24/7 and he told me I could come out whenever I wanted to. - Guncle. What are you, like 14? - [Zoe] Uh, I'm more like 24? - [Maria] Wait, why the hell is the door open? - Girl, it's Fire Island. Everything is open. - [Maria] What the hell is this place? - This is the living room. Fireplace, couches, and that shag carpet is perfect for fucking on. Not that I've ever done that, just, I would imagine so. There's the pool and plenty of places to chill outside, although it's May so it's probably gonna get cold once the sun goes down. Oh, and your bedrooms are front of the house is a queen and up there are the rest of the beds. Come on. (footsteps thudding) (soft tense music) Wait until you guys see the upstairs. You guys can fight over who gets this one. - Ooh. Dibs. - [Sam] Oh, god. (Zoe laughs) (soft tense music continues) - This is my room. (Zoe sighs) - Really? - Mm-hm. (Matt sighs) Oh, and uh, there's another room downstairs. It's kinda isolated, but it is the biggest, so. - Would you guys rather? - No, we're good. - All right. - You want it? All right, let's go. - Oh, great. It's very nice. - Get cozy. (soft tense music continues) (Troy exhales) (soft tense music continues) (upbeat electronic pop music) - Ooh. Come on, Matt, your girl is shaking her ass for you. Ooh. Get up, what the hell are you doing? (upbeat electronic pop music continues) There you go. Ow-ow! (upbeat electronic pop music continues) Okay, now we don't need all that. (soft tense music) (animal vocalizes in the distance) (ominous music) - [Sam] Are you okay? - Uh... Yeah. Uh, I just thought I saw like a- - A deer? - Yeah, I- - Yeah. The island's like crawling with them. They're really cute, though. You can like go up and pet 'em. It's hilarious. - Sure. Right. (birds chirping) - Okay. So talk to me. (Troy sighs) - So yesterday I tried to see if I could spend an entire day in bed without getting up, and other than having to pee, I did. - Wow, wow, wow. You didn't eat? - I had some Doritos and then there was a half drunk mug of coffee on my nightstand, so. - You know, um... Talking to friends might help. If you don't want to- - No, it's... (birds chirping) If I tell you something, then can it just stay between us and then, like, I just would like to go back to the weekend and act like things are fucking normal. - Yeah, absolutely. I love that. - So the day before I found Jaden, I'd broken up with him. You know, we were fighting everyday. I didn't know what else to do. And I'd become this, like, this caretaker for him and I know that sounds super fucked up because he was a really good person and, and, and it's not his fault, I just... (melancholy music) - I'm so sorry. I wish that I knew what to say. (cell phone pings) (Troy sighs) Who's that? - Oh, that's, it's Becca. She wants me to come by. She's actually down on the island. She wants me to come by for like a drink or, I don't know, but if she ever stops working. Fucking lesbians. (Sam laughs) - Yes. Okay. Well, speaking of drinks. - Yeah. Oh, also, um, Maria doesn't actually have a friend that she's gonna try and hook me up with, does- - No, she does. - She does? - She does. - Goddammit. - She does. - Every time. - I know. - It's such a disaster. - I know it's a disaster. I tried to tell her not to, but she wouldn't listen. - Man, I shouldn't have come. - Please don't say that. It was really important for me that you were here because I really missed you. (Sam inhales) (Same exhales) And who knows, maybe getting a one night stand isn't the worst thing in the world. - Okay, sure, I'll get laid and then I can immediately drop dead with COVID. - You're not gonna die of COVID. We're too young to die. - Okay. - But your grandma. (Troy laughs) (Sam laughs) She sucks, right? - You're terrible. You are canceled. (Sam laughs) Fuck. I did, I really, I did miss you, too. - Aye yi yi yi. Okay. I hereby pour this libation to summon forth the very, very, very fun spirit of my old best friend Troy. - You already poured the libation. - I'm pouring more libation- - Okay, enough, enough. Please, please, enough. You're gonna spill it. Thank you. - You're welcome. And also... - Oh, Lord. - What are those? - This is gonna be good for you. I promise. - That's it? - Yep. - That's all I get? - That's all you get. - Okay. (chuckles) Oh, yep. (glasses clink) - Clink. (soft romantic music) (Wes and Joseph breathing heaviLy) - One sec. - No. - No, hold on. I gotta pee. - Oh. (Wes chuckles) (Joseph sighs) - Fine. Fine, I'll go have a look at that moon you keep going on about. - Do it, it's gorgeous. (soft romantic music continues) - Oh, it looks like crap. (ominous music) (rustling in the distance) Wes? (insects buzzing) Wes? (insects buzzing) You all right? You're blowing up that bathroom again? What's wrong with your stomach? (insects buzzing) Wes? (knife slices) (dramatic music) (blood trickling) (water splashes) (electronic music) - Oh, guys, it's become grotesque. Come on. - At least we're not like- - Hey! - These nasties. Y'all are nasty, and you're making Troy feel sad. - No, no, not sad. Just disgusted. - Sorry, Troy. Come on, let's go. Be right back. (Troy sighs) - Okay, so what's the plan? - Ooh, so I'm waiting to hear back from my friend who works at the Ice Palace. He said if a table opens up, he'll save it for us. - Is that safe? - They are super limited capacity. They're being really careful. - I don't know, dude. It only takes one person to kill you. - Oh my gosh, no, ew, shut up. We are not gonna die. - [Sam] Troy, what do you think? - I don't wanna be the killjoy, so. (cell phone pings) - Ooh, that is probably him. Yep, he said there will be a table ready in 30 minutes. Are we going? - Are we? (Zoe moaning) (soft electronic music) (Zoe continues moaning) (soft electronic music) - Yeah, we are not missing our table for this. (banging on wall) Chop, chop, let's go. - [Zoe] What the fuck, Maria? Get out! (chair thuds) - You missed. (gentle music) Down this lonely road - Hey, you are Troy, right? - Yeah, hi. - I'm Jacob, Maria's friend. - Oh, right. Nice to meet you. - Can I buy you a drink? - I actually just um, I just ordered one. It's right here, so. - 12 bucks. - Okay. - Listen, I get it. No problem. - Thanks, sorry. Okay. As you fade away into yesterday Here I stand alone And I wait (ominous music) - Troy. - Zoe. - Can you sing for us? - No. - I haven't heard you sing in so long and I miss it so much. - I don't, I'm okay. I'm good, I promise. - Please, come on. - No, I just wanna sit here and sort of stare into the glass, you know? - Oh, who is that hot man there? - No, no, no, no. No, no, no, it's not about- - He's looking at you, bitch. Ow-ow! - Please, I just, I just wanna have a nice, quiet night with- - Uh, well, all the more reasons to do it. - To do what? - Let that man suck your dick. (Troy laughs) (Zoe laughs) - No, uh, I'm okay. I'm all right. - He's gonna sing. - No, please, please, please. Please, please, Zoe. - He's really good. - Zoe, stop. - You should watch. Come on, let's go, let's go, please. - I'm not, no, I, my drink. - [Krystal] Hi. - [All] Hi. - I'm Krystal. (audience cheering) Yay. How are you, boys and girls?

They were both raped. We're not sure if it was before, or after. And one thing. You're gonna wanna see this. (tense dramatic music) And we got no prints, Jack. - You're saying the killer was staying here? - We think. - What about security cameras? - They'd all been cut. - So you're telling me you ain't got any leads? - I'm thinkin' maybe this has something to do with the murder at the Pines a few years ago? The body that washed up on shore, it was never identified. Who's to say the killer isn't still here? - All right, you know what we gotta do? We gotta keep this under wraps for now. - This is a small island, Jack. - Exactly. And this guy could be close and we got a chance at nailing him if it doesn't go all over the news, all right? We can't have this island gettin' all hysterical. - People are already talkin'. - All right, you know what you tell 'em? If anybody asks, you say it was a GHB overdose. - GHB? - Happens every summer. They won't think twice about it, all right? Go do your job. (tense dramatic music) Santino. If you hear anything, I wanna be the first to know about it, all right? (tense dramatic music) (police radio chatter) (tense dramatic music continues) - Let's go straight, somewhere. - There's trees. - We get to see trees, guys. Be excited. - I love trees. - I love trees, too. (Sam humming) - [Maria] Oh god, I feel sick. I don't remember the last time I was this hungover. - [Zoe] I know, but we're getting old. (soft tense music) - Troy. - What? - Come on. - I'm comin'. I'll get there. - [Sam] Okay. (Troy humming) (soft tense music) (dramatic music) (Troy humming) (soft tense music) (dramatic music) - Oh my god. Fuck. - Look at my old friend. - Look, man, I don't wanna get killed, okay? - Lonely here, isn't it? - Yep. - Look at those fuckin' deer. Always watchin'. Waitin'. - [Troy] They're uh, yeah, they're great. - It's too quiet here. Even the raven himself is hoarse that croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan under my battlements. - My friends are right over there. - Come ye spirits that dwell on mortal thoughts and sex me here and fill me from crown to toe, top full of direst cruelty. You shouldn't be here, son. (birds chirping) (Murph whistling) - Fuck you, man. Jesus. Hey! (soft electronic pop music) And he did that, like, the Batman thing, you know? Where he's there and then- - I love the Batman thing. - Like, have you actually seen someone do it, though? It's really disturbing. - Really? - Yeah. People aren't supposed to move that fast. - Hey, friends. Is tonight the night? - [Zoe] You had molly this whole time? - Hell yes I did. - Well bring it out. What are we doing? - [Troy] Is it, um, what's it like? - Excuse me? What's it like? Troy, it's fucking incredible, especially sex. - [Troy] Oh, well... - Or masturbation. - Great. Cool, while y'all are havin' mind blowing sex, I'll just be masturbating. (all laughing) - There's nothing wrong with a little self care. - Oh, and the showers are awesome, too. Ugh, I took one alone once and I was in the shower for like two hours. - Did you masturbate? - Uh, obviously. I have a hand. - All right. Okay. - Yes. Shove it in, shove it in. - Down the hatch. - You just, fuckin'- - Mm-hm. Mm-hm. - Okay. (Maria and Zoe laughing) - Yes! - There we go. (tense dramatic music) - [Officer] Dispatch, show car two on scene. (tense dramatic music continues) - What do you got? - [Detective Santino] Major contusions to the head, chest and torso. Most likely an ax. Looks like she was raped, too. - Any other prints? - [Detective Santino] Only hers. - She lived alone? - [Detective Santino] Yeah. - Looks like somebody was lying here. Spent the night. Could be our guy. Hey. (fingers snap) Give me this. Take this, lock it down. Nobody in, nobody out, all right? - You got it, boss. - Jack. - What? (tense dramatic music continues) - We can't keep thus under wraps much longer. - Like you said, it's a small island, all right? Let's stick to our plan. - The families, they're gonna be notified. - Well when that happens, I'll deal with it. We're gonna catch this guy, all right? He's sloppy, he's making mistakes. What? - [Officer] Boss, we need you back at the headquarters. We'll run over it. - Santino, just do your job. Do your job. (tense dramatic music continues) (ominous music) (Zoe laughs) (all laughing) - Just stop it. Stop. (Troy sighs) Thanks for inviting me. - I kind of forced you to come. - Yeah, you did. You did, but, I'm lucky to have a friend who forces me to, like, take care of myself. - Yeah, we do that for each other. - I felt really guilty, and I've just kind of been by myself a lot, you know? (Troy sighs) But I swear, I feel like I can breathe and, uh, (chuckles) this weekend was the last fuckin' thing I wanted to do, but, I'm really happy I came. I just sorta love you. (Sam laughs) Oh, mm. - Thank you so much. (gentle music) (waves sloshing) My friend. - My friend. - My friend. - Where are you taking me? - My friend, let's go! - Oh no, we're running. (Sam screams) We're running! (Sam screaming) (gentle music) (Troy exhales) Oh, hey, Zoe? Hey, Zoe? - Mm? - Zoe? Could you, could you hit this, please? (Zoe scoffs) Thank you very much. - No, it's gonna be so fuckin' romantic. The sunrise, the waves. Don't you think so, Troy? Wouldn't you like to have sex on the beach? - [Troy] No. - Yeah, I mean... - I'm fucking you on the beach. It's happening. - We can discuss it. - Uh, I'm making coffee, geez. - [Troy] Okay. That's it, I'm going to bed. - Yeah, we're gonna go upstairs, I think. - Yeah, yeah, I know. Everybody's fuckin'! Woo! (Maria laughs) (Troy grunts) (light clicks) (soft ominous music) (Sam grunts) - Come here. (Sam laughs) (ominous music) - Okay, wait, wait. - Come on, babe. - No, no, no, no. Babe, babe. Hey, babe, I love you but- - We stayed up all night. We're gonna do this. Come on.

(ominous music continues) (electronic music) (shower water pattering) (electronic music continues) (gentle music) Yo, who's on my speaker? Come on, guys, who... From our history Down this lonely road - Guys! You take my heart away (rock ballad music) Here I stand alone - Where the fuck is my shirt? (ominous music) Hey, guys? Sam? (Sam grumbles) Um, did you try connecting to my speaker? - [Sam] What? No. - I, yeah, nevermind. Sorry. (ominous music continues) Hey, Zoe? Zoe? (ominous music continues) - Are they out there? - No. - They said that they were gonna go to the beach a couple hours ago. - I know. - Okay, fine, hold on. Let me just... - Thank you. Thanks. Sorry. (ominous music continues) (insects buzzing) (ominous music continues) Is there, um, is there another spot on the island that, that they'd go to? - Nothing was open. - Well, I mean, just like, um... - You know what? Maybe she texted me. I don't know where the fuck I put my phone. You know what? I mean, they probably went to the beach to walk. I mean they've only been gone for what? Like... - Like six hours. - Oh, hold on. Zoe. "I had to take Matt to the hospital." - Oh my god. - What? - Is she kidding? - If she's texting, I'm just gonna call her. - [Operator] The person you are calling is using a screening service. - She screened my call. - That fuckin' weird. - 'Cause why would she text you and then not pick up my call? - But they got to the hospital and then decide to text me now? - What if we have to fucking quarantine? - No, that wouldn't happen because if it was COVID, she would have said something, right? - Yeah. - I mean it's Zoe. - [Troy] What do you want me to ask her? - Ask her if Matt's okay. - Ask her if we have to fuckin' quarantine. - Hold on, um... And, okay, send. She's typing. Um... "It's definitely not COVID, but I'll be back tonight. My phone's gonna die, XO." - Typical Zoe. - She fuckin' flaked. - She fucking flaked. - This is Burning Man. - This is Burning Man. - Wow. - Yeah. (Troy sighs) - I mean, it's her house. - It's her car. (ominous music) (animals vocalizing) (ominous music continues) You haven't heard anything? - No. I mean, she did say her phone was gonna die, but like, my texts aren't even going through. - Where the fuck is it? Ugh. You try calling it again, Sam. - Babe, I have called your phone like 10 times, okay? It probably fell out on the boardwalk or I don't fucking know. - No I had it here last night. We were playing music off of it, do you not remember? - Yeah, I remember, so that must mean it's on silent or it's dead, babe. It's, it's gonna show up 'cause it literally always does. - It's not, though, so unless you're gonna help me find it, it doesn't fucking matter. I have a raging fucking headache and this isn't helping, obviously, so good fucking night. - [Sam] Hey. Where are you going? - I am going to sleep. - It's 9:00 PM, come one, we haven't even had dinner yet. - All I want is to find my phone and to go to sleep and seeing as how finding my phone isn't a fuckin' option, especially because you two aren't doing absolute shit, (chuckles) I'm going to do the latter. I'm going to take a Xanax and neither of you are invited to join me. - [Sam] Okay. - [Maria] Thanks a lot. Thanks a lot, Troy, yeah. Big help, thanks. (Troy scoffs) - Okay, goodnight sweetie. - [Maria] Yeah, whatever. - You okay? - Yeah, are you hungry? - Yes. - Yeah, let's go eat a sandwich. - Okay, a sandwich. It's weird seeing so many dark houses. - Yeah. - We're the only ones here. - I know. Yeah, it makes sense no one's here 'cause the bars are all closed and everything. - Yeah, I guess. - What are they gonna do- - What are they gonna do? Hang out with us? (Sam laughs) Hey, is Maria okay? 'Cause I feel like I made that situation- - No, that was- - Much worse. - Absolutely not you. She's... She's fine. It's just... It's been... I, eh... - Eh? - It's been tense. It's been tense. - Are you okay? - Yeah. - Yeah? - I'm completely fine, thank you. - I've just, I've never seen her get that aggressive like that. - Yeah. - I don't know. It just was, um (sniffles) it was weird. Sorry, I don't mean like, I'm not judging or anything, I just, it just was- - No. - It was just different. - No, yeah. And again, I'm sorry that you had to be part of that. - [Troy] It was kind of awesome. (Sam chuckles) (sink water running) (ominous music) (Maria sighs) (pills rattling) (ominous music continues) (Maria sighs) (ominous music continues) (lights click) (lights click) (lights clicking) (ominous music continues) - Sam?

We couldn't eat M&M's. - You love M&M's. (Troy chuckles) It's really nice to hear you talk about him. - I miss him. - Yeah. (cell phone ringing) - Is it? - It's my beloved. Hi, Maria. Where did you find your phone, Maria? Maria? (Troy chuckles) - It's the service. She has one of the shit companies, right? - She does. (Troy laughs) (phone line trilling) Hi. Sweetie pie. - Honey, honey boo boo? - Honey baby. No? Nothing? No, she hung up. - Oh, good. That's progress. - Maria? You left the fuckin' door open again. Hello? - She's probably asleep. - You're right. She probably took another fuckin' Xanax. (Troy sighs) - Thank you. - Yes. (Troy grunts) - I'm not saying thank you again. (Sam laughs) What? - I should go check on Maria. - Yeah, go. (footsteps thudding) - Maria? (ominous music) Maria? (ominous music continues) - Hey, um, Zoe's outside. (door opens) (ominous music continues) - Hey, Maria? (thudding in the distance) (ominous music continues) - Sam! Sam, um, Zoe told me she was outside, but there's nobody there. - Maria's not upstairs. - What? Where's my... Where's my phone? - [Sam] What do you mean where's your phone? - It was here and... - [Sam] Where, where the fuck is my phone? - Um, I don't wanna be here. I wanna leave. - Okay, wait a minute. - [Troy] I wanna leave here, Sam. I don't feel safe. - Where are you gonna go? - Where the fuck are our phones, then? - I don't know. Let's take a sec- - I, I don't, I don't wanna be here. (water trickling) (ominous music) I swear, if there's nobody in here, then I'm just gonna start banging on people's doors because... Well we have to talk to somebody and I don't... Okay, look, the light's on. Great. Let's uh... Okay, so- - Okay. "Due to the pandemic, we are closed." - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I see. We're just gonna go in and ask to use the phone and then we'll be out. - I don't know, dude. - It's not a big deal. (ominous music) Look, they got the power running. That fountain's fucking on. It's something. Okay. Um... Please be open, come on. Great. Hello? Hi, excuse us? Hello? (ominous music) The light was up there. - Yep. (ominous music continues) Wow. - Yeah. Hello? (Troy sighs) (ominous music continues) That door is open. - [Sam] Yeah. (ominous music continues) (metallic clanging) (Sam gasps) - What the fuck was that? Was that upstairs? - I think that was upstairs. (ominous music continues) - Hello? Hey, sorry, hello? Fuck. There's nobody up here. - Oh, shit. I don't think there's a caretaker here, dude. I think, I think somebody's squatting. - Yeah. (Sam exhales) (ominous music continues) - Huh. I can see our house from here. Troy? (ominous music continues) - We have to go. We have to go. - Why? - That's my fucking shirt. Just go. - Your shirt? - Yeah. - Why are we running? - Just keep near me closely. Just keep near me. (tense dramatic music) Come on. Hurry, hurry. (tense dramatic music continues) Yesterday, while I was taking a shower, I got back to the room and my fucking shirt was off the bed, okay? And then when we got to that, that fuckin' attic, it was in that sleeping bag. My shirt was in that person's room. - What? - So they came into the house and they took it and now the phones are gone and, and Maria and Zoe are fucking gone and I don't know where they are. - Take a deep breath, okay? - So some, some motherfucker is fucking with us. - Okay. - And I don't, I don't, like, I don't wanna be here. I wanna get on the next fucking ferry. I wanna fucking leave this place. - Okay, that's fine. - Okay? - Yep, this is very, very scary. - Yeah, I know, I- - Hey, hey, just breathe. - I don't need to be calmed down, I need to find a phone. - We're gonna find a phone. We're finding a phone. - Okay. - We'll go back to the restaurant and we'll find a phone. - Which way is the restaurant? I don't know where we are. - It's this way. I'm pretty sure that it's this way, just- (dramatic music) - Fuck, go, run. (Troy and Sam panting) (dramatic music continues) Go!

No, no! - Hey. It's me. (laughs) Remember? Sorry about the straps. I tried to keep 'em lose for you. I'm building a family. No more isolation. I fucking hate this isolation! But now I have a family. And you. Boop. (Troy gasps) Yeah, I did what I had to do for us to be together. Okay, so neither of us would ever have to be alone again. After I lost everyone that meant everything to me, I promised myself that I would never be alone again. I mean... I deserve that, right? And then this fucking pandemic hit and can't even go on Grindr these days without a fuckin' COVID test, am I right? Sorry. (Troy whimpers) Guess I shouldn't complain, though. Everyone seemed to forget I might still be alive after COVID hit. (Troy sobbing) That didn't change how lonely I became. And then I, I found you. And when I saw you, I knew. I knew that I had found someone that I could depend on, who had friends that I would actually wanna hang out with. (laughs) Crazy is that? - Please let me go. Please? (Rafael laughs) - Go? (Rafael laughs) Go where? (laughs) Back out to the pandemic? (laughs) No. You're much safer here with me. (kiss smacks) (Troy whimpers) (hit thuds) (bone cracks) - [Troy] Fuck! - I'm sorry about that. I really am. But it's the only way that we could be together. Have you seen what it's like out there? Just going outside is dangerous, okay? I can keep you safe and I can make you feel good. - Fuck you. - Do you have any idea how long I have waited for someone like you? Do you understand? (knocking on door) - [Troy] Help! Help! - Shh. (knocking on door) (ominous music) (door closes) (ominous music continues) (banging in the distance) (ominous music continues) (ominous music continues) (Troy gasps) - [Troy] Hey, hey. Please, help me. Help me. He's out there. - Oh, shit, oh, shit. - He's gonna kil me. - It's gonna be okay. Relax, just relax. Relax. - Ow, fuck! - Relax. - Ow! - [Troy] Oh, please, please. - [Detective Santino] Just relax. - Fuck! Hey, hey, he's- (ax thuds) (flesh squelches) (blood dripping) Fuck!
