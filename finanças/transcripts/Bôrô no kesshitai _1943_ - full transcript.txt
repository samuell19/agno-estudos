Toho Eiga Co., Ltd. SUICIDE TROOPS OF THE WATCHTOWER WRITTEN BY Yamagata Yusaku & Yagi Ryuichiro DIRECTED BY Imai Tadashi A part of North Korea that is divided by the Yarlung and Tomanko rivers is now an important industrial area for Japan. Decades ago, it was an undeveloped, deserted, and mountainous area. However, a gang of bandits, chased by a Manchurian punitive force, sneaked into this now-developed area and started to go on a rampage. Around Showa 10 (1935) The tea is ready. OK. Time for a break. Hey! Tea time. Please, have some tea. Here you are. Hey, much obliged. Sugiyama-san! Ah, you must be the newly-assigned one. Yes, sir. Constable Asano, newly-arrived. Where is the chief, sir? The chief went to the opposite shore. Welcome back. Anything in particular? No. Nothing in particular. Keep up the good work. Why don't you go help out at the Resident Police Station? They shouldn't use people for free labor to build the stone wall for their house. Policemen get a high salary. They can hire workmen. - Hello. - I'm back. Korea Governate, North Pyongan Province constable, Asano Soji. As of October 5th, ordered to serve at Nanzan Resident Police Office. Just arrived. Reporting for duty, sir. No, no. The chief is over there. Kumazawa-kun, how does it feel to be chief? Hey, Asano-kun, have a cup. No, no, no. We can sing tonight, can't we, Chief? All right. ♪ When the green leaves are getting thick, ♪ the bandits are... Ma'am. What is it, Wan'en? Kin-san is singing. Let's go. Let's go. Look, your face is black. I don't care. No. You'll be laughed at. ♪ Guarding the border... Hey, why don't you show your specialty to Asano-kun, huh? Please show me, sir. Lin-kun, do it. Thank you very much, sir. Watching that dance, I'd have believed that Kin-san was a real mainlander. Maybe so. Me too. If I called myself Hayashi, you'd think I was, as well. And my wife is used to wearing a Japanese kimono. - Nothing new, sir. - Well done. You must be hungry. I'll sub for you. Go have something to eat. Yes. Hello? It's me. Takatsu at Nanzan. Sonoi at Fukuondo Branch. Upstream from Fukuondo, nothing new, sir. Hello... Hello. Yes. Reitan? This is Takatsu at Nanzan. Nothing new upstream from Nanzan. Thank you. Oh, Ko-san. Come in. My wife will give birth soon. Oh, it's time already? Could your wife come help? Sure, she can. One moment. Hey, Yoshiko! Yes. Ko-san's baby will be born soon. Congratulations. I'll get ready. Ko-san's baby will be born. Boy or girl? We don't know yet! Funny, that such a stubborn man came to ask. Hey, Kin-kun. It's our time. Wan'en, I'm sending you home. Attention! Salute! Constable Kumazawa and Constable Kin, go patrol the riverbank. Shopkeeper. You sing well. Do you have children? Yes, a daughter. - How about a son? - No, only a daughter. Shopkeeper, do you know a man called Wanko? Wanko? By what he says, it sounds like his father could be you. Who are you? I'm back! Welcome. Thank you. Your daughter worked well. It was fun. Kin-san sang a song. Did he, now? How about the newcomer? Seems like a quiet man. The work of border security is tough. It will be hard until he becomes accustomed. Well... He is a new customer. Father. What happened? From fighting? No. Accident with the machine. I was working at a sawmill in Yangtze. Is it painful? It's painful, huh? OK. Come to the Resident Police Station. I can get you some medicine. No, that's too much for me, sir. I also wanted to ask you if you'd been in Manchuria. Please come with me. Wan'en, time to sleep. Damn. - Hey, An-kun. - Yes. That sound came from the village, didn't it? Kin-kun! Kin-kun! That way! Ko-san, go see what's happening. Go look, dear. Constable Lin, present! Present, sir! Constable Sugiyama, present. Constable Asano, present. Ma'am. Wait a moment, I'll be back soon. The baby will be born any minute! Hey, Kin-kun. Kin-kun, hold on! Lin-kun, bring the first-aid kit. - Where is the first-aid kit? - First-aid kit? Kin-kun. It's me. Can you see me? Yes. Regrettable... Hey... Kin-kun. Will you call my wife? - She's at Ko-kun's house. - Yes. Bring Wanryu of the Sogyoken Restaurant. Yes. You guide Constable Asano, guarding the riverbank. - Ryu-kun. - Yes? Take care of Kin-kun. Asano-kun. Be careful. The man has a gun. - Understood? - Yes. How is Constable Kin? It's difficult. Only a short while ago, he was singing fine. He is a border security policeman. Go now. Hello. Hello? Main station. It's me... Ryu. Hold on. Please, take care of my sister in Seoul. Who is it?! Maybe a stray dog. Tell me clearly. You are supposed to inform us immediately if a stranger comes into your shop. You know that. This is not as simple as a suspicious man walking around. Constable Kin was shot. Sir, the bandits in Manchuria gave me a hard time. They burned our house down... and killed my wife. We escaped across the Yarlung River to come here. That was five years ago. Thanks... thanks to the Resident Police Station, we can live peacefully here. I am grateful, sir. I feel really frustrated by that incident tonight. You must understand how I feel. I've never done anything wrong to you. Yes? Hello, yes. Main Station? This is Takasu at Nanzan. We're keeping on high alert. Considering the information, it's been concluded that it was the gang of Koryu the communist. Uh-huh. What? For the purpose of sneaking in? Probably, they were chased out by the Manchurian punitive forces, they ran out of ammunition and food, and now they are seeking to set up camp on the shore opposite us. Yes, yes. We'll keep investigating further, sir. His condition is not good. Will you suggest a treatment before the doctor arrives? Yes. Then, I will talk to my wife. She has a bit of medical knowledge. Wait a moment, please. Hey, Wan'en. Call my wife. Yes. Yoshiko, the main station will suggest treatment. Listen to it. Ma'am? Kin-san is...? If only... if only I had been back sooner. I see. He has passed away. Yes. Just now. Hello. Hello? Constable Kin, at 11:20, he died on duty, sir. She says that her husband is lazy, so give him a talking-to. Is that so? Say, you speak Korean so well, Sugiyama-san. Without it, I couldn't get to know the place. I see. I can tell. Is there anything else in particular? "The family of Ninomiya Kinjiro has been living rich, "but in his father's generation the family had been quite pour." Wait, the word is "poor", not "pour". Stand up. Bow! As you were! Sugiyama-san! - You must be tired. - I am. The section we have to guard is so large. At first, I was suffering. Do you think the Koryu gang have really sneaked in? The problem is, we don't know. I don't think they'd come out. - At that moment, you'd be shot. - I don't think so. No, it's not a joke. Look. Kin-kun is resting there. It's Kin-kun's younger sister. I am deeply sorry. Has the man who killed my brother been caught? The chief will give you all the details. This is Constable Asano, newly-arrived. He arrived the day the incident happened. It looks like your brother and I were exchanged, and now he's gone. He sang for me during my welcoming party. - Ryu-kun? - Yes? Come. I brought Kin-kun's sister. Come meet her. I see. Sure. I will quit school. Without my brother, I can't continue my schooling. But isn't it only half a year until graduation? It's a shame. I am thinking of going to work somewhere. To work? You mean... give up on being a doctor? If you quit school, your brother would be disappointed. I'm against it. Chief. I have no other choice. I have decided. I will sell my rice field. I'll do it for Eishuku-san's tuition costs. Kin-san asked me to look after her. If she quits school, I'll have let him down. But if I told her that I was selling my rice field to pay for her education, she'd hesitate to accept. Will you tell her that you're the one covering her tuition? I ask you this, sir. I see. If you insist. Eishuku-kun is lucky. I'll take care of it. Thank you, sir. Who is it? Chief-san. This man is all right. Come in. I'll leave then, sir. I found out. The man who killed Kin-san is a spy for Koryu, like we suspected. I see. How did you find out? That night, at the house of Mangawa, a man in wet clothes appeared. He was given leftover food. After eating, he said, "you will get a big surprise soon", and disappeared. I heard the story this morning. No doubt he was a spy for Koryu. It suggests an attack plot by the Koryu. Yes, probably. Koryu was chased out by a Manchurian punitive force, then ammunition and food ran out. If he doesn't spur his men on, they will desert him. And now, Koryu is frustrated. When the river freezes, they will cross and come over here. Thank you. Keep up the investigation. I will. Koryu killed my brother. I hate him. We'll catch him. Be careful out there, and take care of yourself. Good work. Wait. Use the back door. Be careful. I expected you to come. I will send you off. It's good that you can continue your studies. Yes, Chief-san is so kind. Yes, he is a good man. Now, the freezing season has arrived. The protective wall of the Resident Police Station was completed successfully with the cooperation of the people from Neighborhood Watch and all the others in the village. So, tonight, we'll have some sake. It's not much, but this is our gratitude for your labor. Please accept it. But, when the water is frozen, the bandits may come from anywhere. If we let our guard down, they will attack us mercilessly. Of course, the Resident Police Station is ready for anything. But the riverbank is so large. Without your cooperation, it cannot be protected satisfactorily. Tonight's meeting is being held to discuss such matters. Gee, it's cold. - Cold, isn't it? - Not yet. Pretty soon, your body will be a frozen block of ice. It's true. Fish is sawed, duck is cut with a sickle. - With a sickle? - Yes. At minus 30 degrees, a pond gets frozen overnight. Awakened, the ducks start struggling with frozen legs. Then, we cut them with a sickle. It is called "duck harvesting". Hey, thank you for your work. - Welcome back. - Welcome back. Must be cold. Warm yourself. How was the meeting? Many people came and listened to me eagerly. Must have. When the river is frozen, nobody feels at ease. - Please, have some hot tea. - Thank you. I feel revived. During patrol of the riverbank, nothing was found. Good. Well done. Come here, warm yourself. Get changed. Yes? Yes. Nanzan Resident Police Station. Telegram received by the post office? For Chief Takasu? Telegram? I'll give the phone to him. Wait a moment. Hello, yes. This is Takasu. From where? Kumamoto? I see. Please read it out. From the chief's hometown. I see. All right, then. Thank you. Welcome back. No need for tea. I'll be going out again soon. Oh, but... Yoshiko. Yes? Did you call me? I got a call saying I received a telegram. From my big brother. Your brother? "Mother is in critical condition... I inform you of this." Critical condition? He just said, "I inform you of this." He didn't say, "come home immediately." Liver problems? Yes, the last letter mentioned a gallstone in the liver. She is old, after all... Listen... You still have time. It's just started to snow. There's no ice yet. You still have time to go see your mother. I can be alone. No. I gave her my last farewell before coming here. You did too. But... this is different. Mother is in critical condition. When it starts snowing... this will be nothing but a battlefield. Even one hundred troops from our side is not enough. I will send a telegram tomorrow. I believe my mother will forgive me. Nothing to report? Didn't you hear the gunshot? A gunshot? That's the sound of ice forming. It is? I'd forgotten. It's confusing at first. Now, let's switch. What is it? I'm sorry, sir. Accidental shot. Fool! Accidental shot. Gee. Could be punishable. No, no. It's nothing. It's common for beginners. No one was hurt? Only a window. It'll be fixed soon. Please go back to sleep. - Why don't you warm up inside? - No, thank you. Maybe next time. Thank you. Goodbye. Welcome back. Any news? No, sir. Good work. What happened here? I repaired it. How was it broken? I fired by accident. At 2:25 this morning. I forgot to put the safety on. Don't you know how to use a gun? Asano-kun isn't used to it yet. And he was exhausted. So is everyone else. Everyone is working from afternoon to night. - Constable Asano. - Sir. When you arrived here, I told you about the attitude that border policemen should have. Yes, sir. Do you remember? Yes, sir. That we must be alert for anything, no matter how trivial. And that I should never let down my guard. Don't just say the words. Drill the meaning into the core of your belly. Understand? Into the core of your belly! Whose turn is it to patrol the riverside? Mine, sir. Asano-kun, as punishment, I order you to patrol the riverside. Go with him. Sugiyama-san. I'm quitting. I'm going back to the mainland. My father went through hardship in the border guard. He wanted me to have the same experience. But I've had enough. - I quit. - Wait. We're on duty now. Come on. You're fortunate. You have parents to complain to. I have no one to cry for me, even if I die. What is it? Asano-san is visiting. Asano-kun? Let him in. Please, come here. What's the matter? Well, sir, I'm resigning. What's that? - Resigning? - Yes, sir. I want to quit, sir. No. Why, sir? No, you can't resign. Go now. Report for duty! Asano-kun. The river is already frozen. Needless to say, before the ice has melted, you must stop thinking about yourself. That is the duty of a border policeman. Understood? You have to understand. Asano-san is such a kind man. Why don't you treat him better? The chief talks tough, but he's a very gentle man. Hey! Anyone who's free, come to the backyard for sword training. All right! I'll smash him. The chief is a 4-dan grade. 4-dan is nothing! What is it? I said, what is it? Kumazawa-san. Hey! Eishuku-san. What a surprise. You've really become a Seoul beauty. Madame will be pleased. Ma'am! Ma'am! You're on holidays already? So nice that you could come. I feel more at home here with you, Ma'am, than anywhere else. Is that it? It's because you wanted to be with Ryu-kun, didn't you? Come on. I'll call Mrs. Lin. Here, a newspaper. Eishuku-san has come. Hats off! Respectful bow toward Seoul! At ease! - Happy new year! - Happy new year! - Happy new year! - Happy new year! Please, find time to come to my house. My wife wants to offer you some New Year rice cake soup. Thank you, sir. Ma'am, thank you. Please, sit. Wow, what a feast! It isn't much. I still remember the delicious taste of rice cake soup from last year. Make yourselves at home. Are the rice cakes done? I can toast the rice cakes. You can help Ma'am. Thank you. Ryu-kun, don't show us up. It's hard enough for us single men. Don't eat all of it, now. Here you are. This is good. Shall I ask Kin-san to join us? Yes, why not? Have some more, please. Ma'am. This picture is...? It means... bereavement? Don't ask me. - My husband will tell you some time. - No, Ma'am. We're like strangers. When was the bereavement? It was... toward the end of the year. Ma'am. I've been here with you, but I didn't notice it! That's all right. We weren't supposed to tell anyone. But... I'm sorry! Don't cry on New Year's. It's getting cold. Please have more. Ryu-san, you too. Kumazawa-san. My husband will scold me if you are this way. Please. I won't hesitate, then. - Ryu-kun? - Yes. Well, let's eat. Eat up well. You must work hard again this year. Hey, what's wrong? You're all so quiet. Please, make yourself at home. Have another bowl. I'd like seconds, please. Asano-kun, how about that mochi rice cake? The truth is, the mochi was sent by your mother. My mother? That's right. The letter didn't say, "give this to my dearest son," but rather, "I'm sending this for all of you." Asano-kun, the remark "for all of you" shows your mother's caring nature. As well as her deep love. Don't you think so? Anyway, this mochi was cut by your mother's hand. Eat well. Having a mother is... a grateful being. Right? Asano-kun, having the taste of mochi on the border is nice, isn't it? Who is it? Who are you? Father. Father. Father. Open up. Open up. Father! You're eating like a wolf. Are you still doing shady things? Father. I am not your father anymore. After you finish eating, get out. I'm leaving. So, just listen. My gang will attack the Resident Police Station soon. So, you're a member of the Koryu gang? It's dangerous here. Move to Manchuria. No, I won't. - Father! - No. I am a man of this village. How can they attack such a wonderful village? Please... think about my sister. What sister? She has no brother. I never told her about you. Father, do you hate me that much? Get out. Get out. Wanko, did you betray us? Father! Father! Father! Father! Ryu-kun. Ryu-kun! The chief's wife came for you. Eishuku-san will treat you. Ma'am, please. Please boil the water. Eishuku-san. Wanko! Isn't that your name? If not, then who's Wanko? Tell us! Wanryu... you called him "father". Wanryu's daughter said she heard it clearly. She's such a silly girl, talking nonsense! One of the two men following you said, "Wanko, did you betray us?" Wanko, Wanryu. Wanryu's son must be in your group. That old man's son couldn't have been a member of our gang. Member? What member?! Why did your gang attack Wanryu? Why did they kill him? Who killed Wanryu? It wasn't you, was it? Since you called him "father". What a stubborn guy! Being soft with him is useless. Get up! He's not my brother! No, no! My brother couldn't be such a bad guy! According to the information, Koryu's movement on the opposite shore is getting very active. The threat of an attack on us is increasing. We think we should forestall their efforts and destroy them. Yes, sir. We request that you supply ammunition and support policemen immediately. We'll dispatch a man immediately. - Constable Lin. - Sir! Constable Lin, you must rush to the headquarters to get ammunition, then come back with supplemental men the next morning. Over. Sir! Goodbye. Yoshiko, move the weapons to the tower. Hello? Hello? Hello! Ma'am! You don't need to do that. You have a baby. I'm all right! Kumazawa-san! Kumazawa-san! The weapons are ready. Be careful! Here, Kumazawa-san! I got one! Go to the police station! Go to the police station! Go to the police station! Go to the police station! Go to the police station! Go to the police station! Go to the police station! Go to the police station! Go to the police station! Go to the police station! Go to the police station! Calm down! Calm down! Don't rush! - You must work with Constable An! - Yes. - You, go there! - Yes. Be quiet! Be quiet! Be patient. Constable Lin will be back with support policemen soon. Chief, let me do it. No. Why, sir? If we do nothing, we're finished. Please, let me do it, sir. Constable Asano is going, sir. Sugiyama-san, are you all right? Constable Sugiyama is going, sir. Sugiyama-san! Ma'am! - Wan'en! - Yes! Dear! You coward! You, alone, are doing nothing! Hey, I'm out of bullets! Bring more! Thank you. Please, let me out! Please! I want revenge for my father. I am Wanko, son of Wanryu. I was one of the bandits. I was wrong! I will kill the bandits too! Your sin is not cleared, even if you kill the bandits. I don't care! If I can destroy them, I don't mind dying! Let him out, please! My brother's not a bad guy! Brother! I'm out of bullets! Get me more! No more, sir! Don't waste bullets. Focus on them! Yoshiko. Are you prepared? You must feel regret because you cannot meet your husband. When the last moment comes, I'll do what your husband will do. Thank you, sir. But I'm all right. I am also prepared. I see. If the last moment comes, please shoot me first. Call Constable Kumazawa. Neighborhood Watch. Go to the underpass. The support forces are here! Our men... They have arrived! The support forces have arrived! The support forces have arrived! The constables are gone, and they'll never come back. No words can describe our sorrow at the deaths in the line of duty of these young men. We hope that their souls will stay here, and help this land and those who follow them. We too will follow them, carrying out their will, by working ever harder toward the ideal of bringing order to Korea. By the development of, and cooperation with, Manchuria, the ancient wilderness here will, day by day, become a thing of the past. Now, the frontier is secure, and people can engage in their jobs peacefully. However, the security and peace of today were only achieved through the work of the border policemen who devoted themselves to their duties and sacrificed their lives. Their spirit shall be highlighted in history for a long time to come. THE END Toho Eiga Distributed by Eiga Haikyu Kaisha
