Small time beach kid ties to the Asian crowd. - Let's do it. - You're hot. - I know. (suspenseful music) Isn't this a lovely way to spend an evening? There's something about parking lots brings out the best in a man. - In Tommy's case it's probably true. - You know Tommy thinks if we play this guy right he'll give us his connection on the docks. - I'll make a good caller.

In case you didn't hear that, they say they'd be back in about five minutes. - And when it goes down, you make sure Tommy's covered. If the others split, let him go, copy? - We take the ones with Tommy. - That's top priority. The others only if he's secure. - Hello sweetheart, your lover boy calling. - In your dreams Quinn. - Oh Bernice you're breaking my heart. - [Bernice] Where are you? - [Tommy] I'm in San Pedro finishing up a deal, any messages? - [Bernice] Not a thing honey.

Get 'em outta here. (speaks in foreign language) - Paramedic, over here. - Tommy? - Matt don't. (police radio chatter) (distant siren wails) - All I heard was, shoot; Loud just like Vietnam, shotgun- - Find the narks who are here keep them away from each other. Now who's running this show? - Lieutenant Wiltern sir, he's over by the phone booth. - Right. check out that mess over there. - Yes sir. - Potato chips. - I'm gonna have to break this up. - This is my partner. - Internal Affairs is gonna want to talk to you. They don't want you getting your stories together. - Our stories? - It's what I'm told. (Julie scoffs) - Somebody's a hell of a shot. Check him for ID. - Wiltern, Matmuso. What the hell happened here? - At least three of them got away. We sent descriptions out over the air. - Oh we got people looking for them. Maybe the two we sent to the hospital got us what we want. - I'd like to talk to my squad. - Excuse me sir. - Yeah. - We have a male Asian in the car; He's dead. - I shot him. - In that case, I'm gonna have to ask you for your weapon then read you your rights. - I know my rights. I'd like to talk to my people. - Not until Internal Affairs is finished with them. We've got a dead civilian on the scene and we've got to find out what happened. - I told you, I shot him. - Ray, I don't hear another word from you until I've given you your rights. - I don't give a damn about rights. Your responsible for this investigation, well I'm still responsible for holding together what's left of my squad. Now unless you stop me, I'm going to talk to them. (police radio chatter) - I'm sorry sir. - It's all right I'm his commanding officer. Art listen to me, you know these II guys are going to question you. - I'll just tell them what I saw. - If you want to talk to them that's okay, if you don't want to talk to them, you tell them that or you tell me. - I don't know how many shots I heard. By the time Matt and I made it over here all hell had broken lose. - Well how many times did you fire your weapon. - There was a truck in the way, I never even got a shot off. - The suspect came from the Honda which was parked over there, and proceeded to retrieve a shotgun from behind the center vending machine. Officer Quinn was waiting in the phone booth, the suspect opened fire; After the first shot officer Regan and I were on the way. I continued toward the subject and shouted a warning. - [Matmuso] Did you identify yourself as a police officer? - Yes I did. - Okay Ray, this car will take you Downtown. (suspenseful music) - These guys are supposed to be such hot shots, they sure screwed this one up. (suspenseful music) (phone rings) (suspenseful music) - And how many suspects were there, all together? - There were at least six. - Is that what you expected? - Sure wasn't. - Well then, why'd you go forward with the operation? - That wasn't my call. - But you felt the situation was under control? - That wasn't my call. - And when did you first become aware of the suspect's intentions? - When I saw the shotgun. - But you're telling me that prior to that time you had no indication? - What indication? Tommy was by the phone and anyone could see the kid wasn't armed. Then all of a sudden, he's got a gun. Tommy didn't have a chance. - Any chance they knew he was a cop? - No, no way they didn't make him. - [Interviewer] How do you know? - I know, because Tommy was the best nark that I ever worked with and those those piss ants didn't have a clue. - What'd you do when the shooting began? - I couldn't get across the street. - [Interviewer] What do you mean? - They're killing my partner and I couldn't get across the street because there's a truck. - Before that, how'd you feel about this whole thing before the shooting started? - Not good, yeah. - What really happened out there Matt? Who screwed this up? Tommy being a cowboy? (Matt laughs) - You're enjoying yourself aren't you? Huh? - Hey pal, they got me out of bed for this, you know the drill. - Yeah I know the drill. I think the drill stinks. Tommy Quinn was my friend and he's dead and I should be with his family instead of screwing around here with you, with some stinking drill. - His family's been notified. - Ah, yeah notified. I need some air. - That's when I turned and fired. - Across the lot at the gray Honda? - That's correct. - Who was in the vehicle? - I don't know. - You fired at the vehicle, but didn't know who was in it? - They were firing at me. - You mean from that general direction? - There was no one else there. - Look, Ray we're trying to assess the need for deadly force. - One of my guys is dead and I got a parking lot full of bad guys. There's your need. - Are you aware the man you killed didn't have a weapon? - No. The other guy in the car took off, he must have grabbed it. - Maybe. (bell rings) (suspenseful music) (Matt sobbing) - You okay? - Yeah questions, you know this damn question. - Just to hang in there a little while longer and we can all go home. - Take your hand off me. (suspenseful music) (water swashing) (somber upbeat music) (Art grunts) (Julie sobbing) (somber upbeat music) (dog barks) - Hi. You okay? - Yeah come on in. - I heard the news, I've been trying to call you. - You know I have my phone unplugged. Do you want some weak coffee, I ran out of milk? - No, I can't stay. I'm showing a house over on Valley Vista. Well I could come back if you want. - That's okay. I have to see Carol Quinn and take care of a few things for Tommy. - Will you tell her how sorry I am. God what is she gonna do? Those two little boys. - How's your business? - Well, the market's soft but my office is doing great. You look tired Ray. - I killed one of them. - The newspaper said he was unarmed. - I don't know. Maybe. - You want to talk about this? - Nope. - Ray, I know you've read all the books and you think you know what to expect but if this gets too tough, call me. - I don't think he suffered much. It all happened so fast. - How are the others doing? - They'll handle it. I mean, Julie's got... And Art he's been through so much in his life. - What about Matt? - There's nobody closer to Tommy. But I can't get into his head. - Ray, are you sure you're all right? - Terrific. You know anybody who wants to buy a boat? - I'll come back when I'm finished. - No, it's okay. I won't be here. (car engine roars) (tires screeching) (distant siren wailing) Dolores, Hi. - Hi. I saw on the TV about Tommy, what happened to him. He was a nice guy. - Yeah he was a nice guy. Listen, Dolores you left me a message. - I just wanted to talk to you. - About Tommy? - Yeah. - Thank you. - Tommy and me, we were friends. He told me to go back home, go back to school. - Why didn't you listen to him? - Got no place to go back to. I got some friends to meet. Look I hate to ask, but Tommy, he owed me some money for the thing with Mario. - How much? - 100, he promised me 100. - Okay. Look here's 200. And Mario was a big deal to us. And Tommy would have wanted it that way. - Thanks. - Yeah. - If Mario ever finds out that I snitched him off, I'm in a lot of trouble, you know? - He won't find out, he's in jail. - Listen, if you ever get anything else, I mean, anything you would have given Tommy get in touch with me, okay? - Yeah, sure. And you said you shot a guy, dead. - Yeah I shot a guy. - How many guys you killed since you've been a cop? - That was the first. - Does this mean you're not gonna bust me? - I'm not in vice anymore. - Hey, I'm really sorry about your friend. (somber upbeat music) (paper screeching) (somber upbeat music) - Thanks. - Ray. - Mm-hmm. - Talk with you a minute? - If you don't mind watching me eat. - I just left the hospital, looks like you're gonna be okay. - I'm gonna be okay? - The man you killed, unarmed? - [Ray] Yeah. - Well one of the suspects you took down, we questioned at the hospital. - I know that. - He confirms your story. The man you killed had a gun. One of the other perps probably ran off with it. I just thought it'd be nice to give you some good news for a change. - That's the good news? I'm gonna be okay. Department suddenly believes me because this scum says the same thing. Excuse me, I've got a funeral to go. - You're welcome. (somber upbeat music) - How's Carol? - She's holding on. - Hey Donald. - How you doing? - You okay Julie? - I'm okay thanks. - [Art] We'd better go inside. - Yeah.

He's my partner man. - Come on. - We know that. - I wanna pay my respects, Tommy would have wanted me to pay my respects. - Hey, what you need to do is go home. If you don't pull it together real fast, I'm gonna kick your ass all the way there. - Well you take me, I ain't going with him. - Oh man. - Lieutenant, your office has been trying to reach you. The judge is releasing Mario Portillo Grande. - What? - He's Attorney, Varjak, he's got him to set bail. - Bail him and he'll skip. - Judge said if he had Tommy to put on a stand he could convict, but without his testimony those drugs could belong to anybody in the house. (phone ringing) (police radio chatter) - Hey. - Bring my car around cop? 'Cause I got a lot of appointments on the outside. - You may walk today Mario but you're still going down. - I ain't going nowhere but out of here. And I would have sued you and the City for wrongful arrest, 'cause what you think you got for a case that has got nothing to do with me. - My man made you on six other buys. - You're man? You mean the narc who got iced? May he rest in peace, but without him you ain't got a prayer. No way, Jose, oh no way Ray. It's all down the toilet now, and you know it.

Plead bargain? - Yeah. - No way, not on this one, no bargains. - The boy's 19, he's a Vietnamese immigrant, he has no priors and he contends he was being threatened. - By who? - By the people he worked for. He said they would have killed him if he didn't go through with it. - Simon, I'm telling you that kid was like ice, he didn't give it a second thought. No cutting corners. - I understand how you feel Ray, but every time you go to trial, there's a risk. There's a chance you'll come up empty. He's a young kid, and the defense is claiming that your people pulled their weapons first. Just think about it. - Hey Dolores, I've been looking for you. I need your help. - With what? - Mario. - No, I can't do that. - Yes you can. - No, you told me he wasn't going to get out, that's what you said. - You help and this time I'll make it stick. - No, uh-uh, I'm not going to do this anymore. - How old are you Dolores? - Almost 17. - Ever been to Juvie Hall? - No. - Well that's where you're going if you don't help me. Information on Mario is all I want. Totally confidential, phone numbers where I could be reached all hours. You deliver him to me Dolores, and it's worth a lot more than $200. A lot more. - He asked me what I was worried about. He said it was all an act just to keep him off balance. - Was it? - I don't think so. - He's out of control Ray. - Okay. Look, he's having a hard time. - No, you're not listening, Matt is dangerous. - I don't know, maybe he shouldn't be working undercover. - What are you talking about? - Not yet anyway. - Julie? - Maybe none of us should. - Come on, this is what we do. This is no time to quit. - We're not talking about quitting, we're talking about Matthew. - He wants to get these guys so bad, he doesn't even care what happens to himself. - We do the deal together. I'll send Art in with him and you'll team with me. - All right. - Come on I'll buy you guys a couple of burgers, huh? - No, I'm gonna head on home. - Me too. Bye. - Hi. - Hey. - Oh, I've been thinking about you. - Well, I saw the lights on I thought who else would be working late with you. - Should I search for a compliment in there somewhere? - Sure, come on, after 13 years of marriage with all that pent-up energy ready to unleash on the world who's going to keep you from being number one huh? - Thanks. Maybe I could find us something to drink in the back? - No that's okay. - I was just wondering if you were free for dinner. - I'm not. - Huh? - He's picking me up in 20 minutes. I was just doing some paperwork till then. Listen, the dinner is business, I could cancel. - No, it's okay you go on. - What is it? - Hmm? I don't know Barb. Julie and Art think Matt Fisher's dangerous. - Is he? - I don't know, maybe. I don't know anything anymore. Everything seems to be dangerous. - I know how hard it is trying to hold everything together. - Do you? How do you know that? - You're right, I don't know. I try to imagine, I try to feel what you must be feeling but I can't. You know when we were first married, we used to talk all the time. We used to talk about how you felt, we used to talk about what was happening on the job, about how you felt about what was happening on the job. - All right you want to know what's happening on the job? Julie's held together with glue, Matt's not held together at all, Art who knows. I don't want to push Julie, I don't want to chop Matt's legs out from under him, okay? Now we've talked. That's the whole problem. - That's not the whole problem Ray. You're trying to do this whole thing by yourself. You just can't do it that way. Well I'm not the only one you're not in touch with. - What do you mean, Matt? - No, I mean you. I can't push her, I don't want to upset him, it's all about everyone's needs but your own. - I'm their commanding officer. - And Tommy Quinn was one of your men but he was also your friend, you lost your friend Ray, and it's okay for you to feel that loss. When are you gonna cry for him Ray? You know the problem with cops? Whenever something goes wrong you think it's got to be somebody's fault. That's just not true, some things just happen. (footsteps approaching) - [Julie] The one doing the talking is Chi Chi, I don't know the other two. - Keep an eye on them. 12-8 to 12-12, come in. - This is 12-12 we're in position. - Do you have visual contact? - Well that's a negative lieutenant. If we come up any more they're certain hell going to see us. - All right just keep this channel open. - Hugh, so (speaks indistinctly) - That's them. - Here they come. - I cannot believe... (door slams) - What the hell is this, man? - Business man, business. - Got the stuff? - You didn't tell me you was bringing no one. - Hey man, it's my money. He just set this up for me. Hey look brother, I'm ready, are you ready? - [Chi Chi] I don't see no money here. - [Matt] This guy, man. Well somebody better show somebody something. - The shop, there's two more by the office. - [Matt] you know what I'm saying? I tell you what? You show me yours, I'll show you mine. - There's one more over there. - Relax man. - [Matt] I'm relaxed. - Stop being high. Let's see the color of your cash. (Matt laughs) - [Matt] This guy. - Come on. You have the money, shower to him. - [Art] Hey brother. - Now we talking, come on, your stuff's inside. (suspenseful music) - It's a trap. It's a trap, this is 12-8 to 12-12, hit 'em. - Are we on the same frequency lieutenant? You didn't give a signal. - Damn it, I said him now. - let's do that guys. (upbeat music) (tires screeching) - Ah! (upbeat music) - Freeze! Turn around. Put your hands behind your back. (upbeat music) (loud thud) - [Julie] Hey, hold it! Don't move. Jack! Don't move. - Put your hands behind your head. - What the hell is going on? You blew it. - Too many players Matt. - What are you talking about? This is my case, it was under control. - You couldn't call it, you couldn't see it. - It was under control! - Not from where I stood. - Well maybe you better think about that lieutenant because if you're getting too gun-shy for this line of work. - That's enough. Now you can it. - What happened Ray? - I don't know. - Bingo! And I want a raise. (car engine revving) - Hey man, I'm not gonna give you no ball, I've been done a few times already, I wanna work this one out. I can do good for you. I can bring you people. We'll be talking, man. I do you right, guaranteed. - What do you want to do with this guy? - It's okay. We're letting Matt work him. (upbeat music) (pager beeps) (upbeat music) - Morning. - Morning. - Now, the defense is going to try to create confusion to cast doubt, to discredit your actions, including Tommy Quinn's at the time of the shooting. I'm going to lead off with you two, to try to set up the operation. I want you to speak clearly, I want you to try to remember every detail, everything that happened. Tell the truth, maintain your credibility. I wish Matt was here, he's the one who disarmed them. - He'll show. - Did you talk to him? - No, but he'll be here. - If he's not, he's in contempt. Now I want you... - They turned him into a choir boy. - It's about that time. - Hey man, you came hell in there. - Officer Regan, could you tell us how you were able to communicate with the other members of your squad. - We're in two-way radio communication with officers Tobias and Fisher. One-way communication with officer Quinn. - You could hear Tommy Quinn but you couldn't talk to him? - Yeah, that's right he was wearing a body mic. - And at what point did you leave your car? - When the suspect started shooting, we jumped out of our car and headed for officer Quinn. - And did you see when officer Tobias and officer Fisher got out of their car? - Not exactly, what I saw was a large truck stopped in front of them. - But none, none of the police moved until the defendant started shooting at officer Quinn? - That's correct. We were waiting for a radio signal from Tommy. He wouldn't call us until he'd actually seen the drugs. - Officer Tobias, how long have you been a narcotics officer? - About two and a half years. - And how long did you know Tommy Quinn? - Five years or so. - Now if I understand correctly, you were in a car parked across the highway from the liquor store, is that correct? - That is correct. - And at what point did officer Quinn draw his gun? - He never drew his gun. - Well, at what point did officer Wiltern begin to fire? - I don't know. My view was blocked by a truck. - I see. Officer Quinn was carrying a gun wasn't he? - Yes. - And you say you couldn't see when officer Wiltern started to shoot, is that correct? - That's correct. - If you were across the highway and your view was blocked by a truck, how can you say for sure that he didn't pull his gun? - Because he never saw the drugs, he wouldn't have drawn or given the signal until he saw the drugs. - I understand that normal procedure is not to call for backup or make the arrest until drugs are exposed. However, with your view blocked, you can't say that normal procedure was followed or that he didn't draw his gun before the defendant fired. - You don't understand. - I understand Tommy Quinn was a longtime friend of yours and you want to protect him any way you can. - That's not true. Before the defendant fired I could see what was going on. - But the truth is, that up until the time the shooting started, this was an absolutely normal drug deal and we can't say for sure who really fired first. - That man posed as a drug dealer in order to lure Tommy Quinn down there with a lot of cash. It was a premeditated murder robbery, that's exactly what it was. - [Ray] I'm working Tommy's snitch. You know Dolores? - [Art] You're dreaming, she'll never come through. - Maybe. I saw Martinez out there, might be time to consider adding another man, what do you think? - What do we need more people for? Every time we get close to something it blows up in our faces. - What's your problem? - My problem? I'm here, how does it look like I've got a problem. - You know what I'm talking about Art, we're supposed to be a squad, a unit. - Oh shouldn't you be giving that speech to Matt? If he cares you wouldn't have to go chasing him all over the place. - What if he needs help? - What if I need help? - Do you? - I'm asking, that's all. - Come on Art, I'd be there for you if you needed me, you know that. - I show you this weapon officer Fisher, and ask if you can identify it. - Yes sir, I can, this is the weapon used to kill officer Quinn. - And how can you be sure it's the same one. - Because I scratched my initials and the date with a pen knife in the stock, and they're right here. - Your honor, I move that this weapon be accepted in evidence as state exhibit 5. - So marked. - Now you saw this weapon in the hands of the defendant Tron Tron? - No sir, I did not, it was concealed prior to the shooting. - Concealed? It's a rather sizable weapon officer Fisher, could you tell the jury how it could be concealed. - [Matt] It was secured behind a newspaper vending machine. - Like this one. - Yes sir, like that. - If you'll step down officer Fisher. Now, after Mr. Tron conferred with his accomplice, could you tell us in your own words exactly what happened. - Yes sir. Mr. Tron came toward the telephone booth where officer Quinn was waiting, and kept on toward the vending machine where he paused. - And what was officer Quinn doing at this point? - He was just talking on the phone. Then Mr. Tron pulled the shotgun from behind where it was concealed, and as he came forward, (gun cocks) raised it, pointed at him. - Your honor, - Matt! Have him go back to the stage. - Office Fisher! - Have him go back to the stage, your honor. - He pulled the trigger and he pulled it again. - [Judge] Officer Fisher, return to the witness stand. - Matt! - [Ray] Hey Matt, what the hell were you doing in there? - [Matt] Hey, just wanted to see him squirm. - Kadazian says you could have caused a mistrial, you want that? - Hey no, I just told you. I just wanted to make the guy sweat. - Look if we don't blow this he's going to be executed, isn't that enough for you? - Now you tell me when that happens and I'll hire a band. - Matt, come on now. We've got to put this behind us. If you have something to say to me, say it. - You mean the thing about Chi Chi, I told you you shouldn't have jumped in. - Not about Chi Chi about Tommy. - I had it under control- - About Tommy. - It was a good caller- - About Tommy, damn it! - It's over, it's done with. - You think it's my fault Tommy's dead don't you? - I didn't say that. - That's what you're thinking. I should have called it off, I should have stopped it, right? - Well, it was your call you made it. - You don't believe that, not for a minute. Come on Matt, I want to hear it from you. I want you to say to my face. - What, you want me to say it or do you just want to hear it? - I want you to deal with it. - No, you just want to get hit between the eyes. Well I ain't giving you that. (door slams) - Got another truck coming in, 60 kilos to move, can you handle it? It's that Cuban blood in you Javier, makes you think you can do anything. Make sure your boys are ready, you do write my meme, we'll both get rich and live forever. - That's it, go. (upbeat music) (tires screeching) (upbeat music) (gun cocks) (upbeat music) (gun shots) (grinder roaring) (upbeat music) - Stop there! (gun shots) Look out Ray! (upbeat music) (gun shots) (Julie wails) (gun shots) - Hold it right there Mario. - Matt shoot him. Shoot him Matt. Damn it, shoot him! (gun shots) (Matt grunts) (upbeat music) - Tommy's dead, and there's nothing you could do about it. (Mario laughs) - Look out Ray. (gun shots) (phone rings) (thunder rumbling) - Wiltern. Yeah, all right I'll be right there. (thunder rumbling) - Lieutenant Wiltern? - Right. - I'm sorry to haul you out in the morning like this, we practicing Downtown to find John Stinson, this is my partner Gobasky. This way please. (somber upbeat music) She looks like just a kid. She didn't have any ID on her. Nothing in her pocket but your card. - Her name is Dolores Silva. - [Police] She work for you? - Yeah. - You think they made her? - I don't know. - We'll holla for a wagon to pick her up. Can they call you for an identification Downtown I mean? - Yeah they call me. Is there anything else? - No. Thanks for your help. (somber upbeat music) (Ray sobbing) (somber upbeat music) - [Art] Yeah. - Hi. Hey man, I owe you guys an apology. - You don't have anything to apologize for Ray. - I wanted to hold us together, just to get through this, and I pushed us further apart. I don't know how to lighten anyone's load. - It had to hurt. We had no business expecting you to change that. - Look, we're gonna spend the rest of our lives wondering if we screwed up with Tommy. We just got to deal with it. - Yeah. - Let's go to work. (somber upbeat music) - [Art] You coming? - I got something to do, I'll catch up with you later. - All right. - Hey lieutenant, I thought you guys forgot about me. I mean, officer Fisher never called me. - Chi Chi, you know a guy by the name of Mario Portillo Grande? - Yeah, everybody know Mario. - Any verdict? - Not yet. - What about Matt? - He's not at home. Landlord says he hasn't been around much. - This is it. (hammer slams) - [Judge] The court has been advised that you've reached a verdict in this case, is that correct? - We have, your honor. - Render it please. - We, the jury, find the defendant Tran Tran guilty of murder in the first degree. (crowd chattering) - Matt should have been here. - Thank you ladies and gentlemen, court is adjourned. (hammer slams) (upbeat music) - The jury's in; Tran Tran, with double account. - Great, maybe that'll bring Tommy back. (upbeat music) - Oh, jeez, who gonna need a chiropractor when she's through. Friend of yours? - Everybody here is my friend. - Don't you think it's time to get the team back together? - Well, that's gonna be a little difficult. Did I mention that Tommy's not with us anymore? - All right Matt, that's enough, it's over. Whatever you think happened, whatever you think of me it's done, we have our jobs to do. You know there are drug dealers like Mario Patillo out there, they're not sitting this out, they're out on the street doing their thing. - Ray, do you really think that pushing Mario off the street is going to stop anything? It's not going to stop anything. It's even gonna even slow him down. - That's why we have to keep coming. If we let them rip us apart, they are winning. Stop running away Matt, stop hiding. - Just trying to decide whether or not I still wanna be a cop. (upbeat music) - Listen to me pal, is it there or not? Are you sure this time? Done. - Deal set? - Set. - This guy's got a hell of an operation. - Yeah. That's what Tommy always told us. (somber upbeat music) - We got something working? - Yeah, I guess you could say that. - It's big. - Sounds like my kind of party. So what do you say Jerry, you feel like riding with me? - You bet. - Let's do it. (suspenseful music) - There he is. - We got him. - [Chi Chi] He's alone, number 9. - We're going in. - Showtime. (upbeat music) All right, he's alone in number 9. You men back us up. Let's go. (suspenseful music) (speaks in foreign language) Mario! Come on. (upbeat music) Jerry. (upbeat music) Art, take the fire escape. (upbeat music) Julie! (upbeat music) - Thanks Mario. (speaks in foreign language) - I know what to do, come on. - Hey lieutenant. - [Ray] Good man Jerry. We did it- - [Art] All right. - [Matt] All right. - [Julie] Wait a go. - [Art] Yeah. - [Ray] And Mario, take a good look at that view, that's the last you're gonna see it for a long time. - [Matt] Looking good. (upbeat music) Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
