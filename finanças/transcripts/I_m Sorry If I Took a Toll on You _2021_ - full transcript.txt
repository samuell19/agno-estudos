You'll wait a long, long time for anything much to happen in heaven, beyond the floats of cloud and the northern lights that run like tingling nerves. The sun and moon get crossed, but they never touch nor strike out fire from each other or crash out loud. The planets seem to interfere in their curves, but nothing ever happens. No harm is done. We may as well go patiently on with our life and look elsewhere than to the stars and moon and sun for the shocks and changes we need to keep us sane. It is true, the longest drought will end in rain. The longest peace in China will end in strife. Still, it wouldn't reward the watcher to stay awake in hopes of seeing the calm of heaven break on his particular time and personal site. That calm seems certainly safe to last tonight. Mom, Dad. I think I was 12 the last time I loved you. Oh, fuck! Shit. Fuck. Oh, come on! Hello? Is anybody there? Hey, it's Cath, uh, can I speak to Victoria? Awesome. Yeah, thanks. Hey, did you get anyone to cover my shift yet? Okay, great. Yeah, forget about it. I can be there for 1:00. Yeah. Sorry about that. I just, I just wasn't sure. Okay. Okay, great. Yeah. Bye. Hello? Hey, I saw your car parked out front. I hope I'm not intruding. Who are you? Sorry, Ryan. You must be Cath. Catherine. Yeah. Do I know you? No. Sorry. I knew your parents. The Moore's, Tanya and Andrew. Oh. Yeah, worked for them. Still do, I guess. Yeah? Yeah, just stopped by periodically, once a week, pull weeds, mow the lawn. Make sure there's no intruders, you know, whatever. Oh, that's sweet? I'm sorry to bother you. No, it's okay. I can get going. I'll come back later. I was just leaving. You can do your thing. Yeah? Yeah. Okay, cool. Thanks. How were they? Your parents? Yeah. Good. Yeah. Sweet. Really? Yeah. I mean, to me, sweet. Yeah. Oh. Hey, don't take it the wrong way. No, no. It's okay, I understand. We talked about you. - A lot? - Enough. Not much, huh? Really not my place to say. What did they say about me? Really? Yeah. I mean, you knew them better than I did. Just that they tried. - Hey. Ryan? - Yeah? I'd like to hear. Andrew was a real character, your dad, made it even better when he was drinking. I never liked him when he was drinking. I did. Your mom did, too. It's 'cause she was scared. Oh, I don't know. He made her laugh. He was being aggressive and she was being nervous. Oh, maybe. They always seemed fine to me. Yeah. They were good at seeming fine. Tanya was always really good to me. Yeah. She could be sweet, I guess. When was the last time you talked to her? I left as soon as I got a job. Man, I was so young. I just wanted to leave. 17, my own place. - Do you regret it? - Regret what? Leaving them. This feels like therapy. I don't like therapy. - I'm sorry. - Ah, no, it's, it's okay, it's nice to have someone to talk to. Well, are you gonna be back up here anytime soon? I don't think so. I did what I came here to do. You're not gonna sell it, are you? That was the plan. Remind you too much of your parents. I guess. I don't know. It's just not really my speed. I'm still trying to figure out how to take care of myself, let alone a property like this. What's that process been like? I've never inherited a house before. It's fine. It's weird that they would leave me their house. Well who else would they leave it to? Well, I should get going. It's really nice meeting you, Ryan. Yeah, likewise, Catherine. Cath's fine. Cath? You there? Where am I? Your home. Home? Well, you know. What's going on? What happened? You had a bit of a spill. It's okay. Don't worry. You're okay now. What time is that? Don't worry. Everything's okay. What time is it! 4:00. 4:00! Easy, Cath! My shift! It's okay. They called, I took care of it. They called you. Well, they called here, yeah. How long have you been here? The whole time. I was down the driveway when I saw you fall. I fell. Yeah, slipped on the stairs, whacked your head. Jesus. Hey, careful. Be sore for awhile. Here, let's take a seat. Okay. Is someone on the way? Ambulance or something? Uh, no. You didn't call anyone? No. ABC. Excuse me. ABC. It's an acronym. Airway, breathing, circulation. I checked all three. You were fine. Are fine, rather. You left my fate up to three letters. There might be a couple letters after that. I don't know. Oh my God. I'm First Aid certified. Come on. Head hurts. I'm not surprised. What if I'm concussed? I mean, I was knocked out. Well, your balance seems pretty good. Uh-huh. - Are you gonna puke? - No. - Cry? - No. You feeling sleepy? Kinda, I guess. How many fingers am I holding up? See, you're fine. Right? I just wouldn't drive for a bit. And how do you suggest I get home? Well, I'm suggesting that you don't go home, at least not for tonight. Oh, Jesus. I can stay with you, if you're scared. Should I be scared? You know, maybe my night should be spent in the hospital. Maybe. Hm. Where are you going? Might as well make the most of it. Apple doesn't fall far. Careful. Thanks. Hey, you want to see a magic trick? No. Just do me a favor. Okay, make sure this is a normal everyday toonie. See, regular toonie. Okay. Which one? Smooth. Magic. Now give me your hand. Close your hand. Other hand too. Okay. Which hand had the toonie? You sure? Hmm. - Wait. - Impressive. That wasn't supposed to happen. We used to have the Moore family reunions. They were something, that I remember of them. Good memories. I guess. Uh, they're just faint memories. I only ever went to a few. Eventually everyone who actually wanted to have a family reunion died off, you know, great aunts, uncles, people you only ever see at family reunions. They always seem to know you and you hardly know them. Awkward for a little girl. I have this image in my head of me holding my mom's hand. We were waiting in line for pasta salad or something. I don't know. Foldable white table in front of us. Circle of white lawn chairs behind us. She looked down at me and I smiled back at her. She was good at that, making me smile back. See, that's a good memory. You think she's somewhere? I wrote to them before they died, a couple months before. What did you say? It was tough knowing what to say at all. You know, that whole part of my life just feels so lost. I put a lot of it on myself, but is that right? I mean, they were not okay. The drinking, they were negligent parents. It wasn't obvious neglect. It was something else. I miss my family. You're supposed to have one, even a fucked up one. - Did they write back? - No. God, made me feel so stupid. Even made them a painting. It's so pathetic. They have it hanging in the living room. Well, they liked it enough to hang it. Yeah, but that's what you're supposed to do is hang up the dumb art your talentless kid makes you. Cool. Well, maybe their response got lost in the mail. Maybe they needed some time to think it through. Maybe it meant a whole lot to them. Maybe they couldn't be bothered to put in the work. So in character of them to put in minimal effort. I'm sorry. Honestly, it blindsides me, missing them, thinking that maybe things were okay. And then remembering, oh, I can't stand these people. That's up to feeling not much of anything at all. What are you doing? You seemed cold last night? What are you gonna do with all of it? Oh, there used to be a pile over by the fire pit. I figured I'd start it back up. This place suits you. Maybe. It's still too much time and effort though. Shit! I'm 25. Not about to quit my job. And we went north to buckfuck nowhere. Your minimum wage, part-time job. Living wage. Sorry. It's enough to survive in a city I like, that's all that matters right now. I mean a place like this, it's every real city person's dream. Yeah. Maybe one day. Kind of an amazing opportunity. And inheritance that buys you time. You know, maybe there's something you've always wanted to be. You could draw. You could paint. I don't think like that. You're describing someone who's giving up. I have a life. Well, maybe there's a whole new life in front of you if you just looked. Don't make me think like that, okay? I panic. Sorry. Hey, at least stay another couple of days. You know, I chopped all that wood. I think it's time I called my work. Told you I took care of that, remember? What exactly did you say to them. Just that you hit your head and you can't come in for like a week or so? A week or so? It's probably for the best. Fuck. Should call them. Why did you do that? I just told them I was your brother and it was fine. My brother? Yeah, it's just a little white lie. It's okay. It's okay. They're seriously understanding. Not cool, Ryan, they're gonna fire me. They're not gonna fire you. They said it's fine and to give you their best wishes. It's okay. I promise. I just didn't want you to worry. I handled it. Who exactly did you speak to? A woman? I didn't get a name. Manager, though? Yeah, maybe. Probably. Oh, god. Seriously, it's fine. I need the money though. You need the money. Really? It's okay. Everything is okay. Just stay for a bit.

It's a bit of a mouthful. Something easier to remember. Yeah. Maybe it's only temporary. You shown that to anyone else. Nervous? I just feel comfortable with you. Oh. You make me feel warm is all. Uh- - No, not, not like that. Um, like a sister, like a friend. Oh. I've always wanted a sibling. Well, I could backfire. You don't get to choose a sibling. A friend then. Come on. No friends? I don't actually believe you. Well, I mean, I work with people. I go out with them sometimes and I'm friendly with them, but, I wouldn't actually call them friends, you know? Yeah. A friend would be nice. I can be your friend. Wouldn't a friend called for help if their friend was concussed. Well, wouldn't a friend use their time and knowledge to aid a friend if they were concussed. Thank you. I'm fine. Are you sure? I can go, if you're okay, I mean. Yeah, I'm well, thanks. You're more than welcome to leave. Maybe I should. Yeah, maybe you should. Okay. See ya. Okay. Bye. Off I go. See ya, Ryan. See ya, Cath. Wait. Yeah. Nevermind. What the fuck was that? Ryan? You out here? Okay, I saw your truck. I know you're still here. - Come on! - Jesus! Did I scare you? Holy fuck. You're not funny. It's kind of funny. Fuck off. I'd like to say that I'm sorry, but I don't know if I am. It was good. No? Yeah. You forget something. - Oh, okay. - Huh? Nope. - I thought. - No. All wrong. Uh, you, you got it all wrong. - Uh. - Yeah. You seemed like- - Ah, whatever I seemed like, no. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to lead you on. I thought I was doing well. Jesus Christ. A friend, we were becoming friends like you wanted. You blew that now. - Sorry. - Okay. No, I'm sorry. Okay. - Maybe- - I'll leave. Good call. It's been fun. No? I don't know what this has been. Fun. Yeah. Okay. Weird. I should go home. That's enough of here. Thank you for everything you did for them and for me. My pleasure. Let's just carry on, you know? Carry on, hanging out? Like, I don't know men, but life, carry on. Yeah. Okay. Let's carry on. I think you should go. Can I just stay one more night? I'll leave early in the morning. It's late. I'm tired. And I know the boundaries now. Fine. First thing though. Yeah, first thing. This was such a mistake. That bad, huh? Not you. Not just you. Why am I here? I shouldn't be here. Stupid. Sorry. I hope, uh- - Don't. No. It's okay. Okay. Let's just chill. Okay? Yeah, sure. O-okay. Maybe some wine. Okay, maybe some wine. Anything you've gotta do before you go? It's as clean as it's gonna get in there. I imagine you can handle the outside. Yeah, I'll probably stop by next week. Cool. When are you gonna sell it? I don't know. I don't really know where to begin. One day at a time, I guess. Just happy to leave. Yeah. Bye, guys. Fuck. Oh, goddammit! What the fuck? I forgot my bag. Oh, uh, I can unlock the door for you. Something wrong with your car? No, no, it's fine. Beg to differ. It's something with the engine. It should be easy. Oh, you seem to know what you're talking about. You're right, I don't. Well? Yeah, no clue. I can go call someone. No, it's okay, I can. Too late. Jesus Christ. Yeah, yeah. About 10 minutes from there. No, uh. Yeah. Yeah, I took a look at it's was just. I'm not sure, you'd have to ask her. She said she knew her way around engines, but I think she might have been lying to me. How long will that take? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. See you in a couple hours. Yeah, sure. Bye. Shit! Hey. Hi. I think that's about enough for the day. It's exhausting. That's okay. I really appreciate everything you've done so far. Whatever you need, I'm here. Thanks. Lots of wood for the winter. Yeah, uh, the next residents will be really grateful. You okay? Yeah. Just thinking. About what? When you tried to kiss me. No, I'm sorry. - We don't need to- - No, no. It's okay. No, seriously. What if I want to? Want to what? Mention it. Talk about it. Why would you want to do that? What if I wanted to try again? Yeah, crazy. Right? - But like- - And? Whatever that means. Are you serious? I don't really know. Come with me. This isn't right. What do you mean? Not in your dead parent's bedroom. What are you doing? Just getting some drinks. I figured you could use one. You're getting the drinks for once. I thought it was appropriate. Did a tow truck come? Oh, yeah. Didn't you want to tell me? I didn't know what you're doing in there. Didn't want to interrupt. So, care for a drink? It's still a bit early for one. No? It's never stopped you before. Yeah, fine. Oh, what'd he say? Who? The tow truck driver. Where's my car going? Any guess on when I can get a quote or go pick it up? They said, you'd get a call tomorrow morning. What number did you give him? What do you mean? What do you mean, what do I mean? He's gotta call somewhere. Yeah, of course, I gave him this number. Oh, what is it? Well, I don't know it off by heart. So how did you give it to him? It's written down in that drawer. Oh. Okay. Don't worry. You can trust me. Actually, could you go get it for me? Yeah? Yeah, I think I know the number here, but I want to double check. Who cares if you know it? Well, I'm selling it and whatnot. Go get it and stop asking stupid questions. Okay. Thought it was in here. Maybe it's this one? 4516. - Huh? - I got it. It's 4516, I'm sure of it. - Yeah? - Yeah. Sit the fuck back down. It's nice to have you as my bitch though. Cheers. There was a time before them and a time after them, you can feel it. Like a new person was born. A new person you could love more Sucks that the memories of them are stained with the thoughts of who I was or the reality of who I was, I should say. Well, your parents would never- - I've been thinking a lot about your song, as goofy as it was. Who's it for? I dunno. I guess- - Well, surely you must've had some girl or several girls in mind. I- - Family fills the streets with blood. Is the family doing the killing or was it their blood? I guess I never thought of it. I- - Well, it's your song. You must've known when you wrote the words down. Well, a murderous family, that's not so interesting to me. But a dead one is? I'm tired. I just wish I could have said bye to them. I told you that yet. I see them in my dreams still. They smile more in my dreams. What is up with that? I dreamt about you once. At least, I think it was a dream. It felt like one. It was before I met. You know, I can't explain it and I don't try to. Maybe it wasn't you. But I heard something in the woods, my first night up here. First, I thought it was an animal. But then I caught a brief glimpse of it. Thought it was a person, lost or otherwise. I wasn't sure if I should go investigate or go back inside. I walked into the woods. I saw what I was looking for. It was a person, a man. I wasn't sure who it was at the time, but I'm starting to think it was you. I didn't know what to make of it. I still don't. I didn't know how to feel about it. I still don't. I didn't know if it was love that I felt. I still don't. Do I know you? No, sorry. I knew your parents, the Moores, Tonya and Andrew. Hi, there. You thought, you thought I was gonna feed you these? After, after I saw you going through my bag, you still thought I was gonna feed you these? How fuckin' dense are you? Oh, wow, more dense than I would have thought. Let me guess. You still think you fell and hit your head a couple of days ago? I'm sorry. No, no, no. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, please don't cry. Is there anything I can do to fix this? Anything? Please tell me. It'd be my honor. What was that? Fuck you. Oh, that's too bad. Hello? Hello? You really are something special, special, special, special. Come on. Yeah. You once told me you wanted a friend. I'd like to be that for you. Given myself to you. Now it's time to give yourself to me. Be vulnerable for me. I want to watch you cry. Can you cry for me, Cath? Cry for me, you fucking bitch! I want to see you fucking get it! Cath, come here. Was it something I said? I promise. Just one more night together. If you want, I can do this all night. Slow down! You're going too fast. YOu're gonna hurt yourself if you're not careful, Cath. You gotta slow down. You stupid, bitch. Watch your step. I'm gonna get ya! You've got a lot of fight in you. I'll give you that. Your parents would have been proud. What's it feel like to be loved? Tell me. When our Dad fucked my mom, she must've felt it. What do you think it felt like for her. I don't, I haven't. Our dad was a good guy, for awhile anyways, when he was alive. The hush money helped. Sure, having a couple of loving parents would have been better, but money goes a long way. You would not believe the things that money can do. Why was her dad such an unfaithful piece of shit? Huh? Please. I guess it was worth something. I exist. When the money stopped coming, what was I supposed to do? And what was stopping me from meeting the oh, so, beautiful Catherine. I've heard such fantastic things. I have to admit at first I was a little underwhelmed, but the more I saw myself in you, the finer you became. These last few days, you've really been a pleasure. Seriously. What did you want? I don't even know anymore, but I'm really enjoying myself. Oh, I forgot. Want to see another magic trick. Watch carefully. Poof! Ta-da! What? Unimpressed? A little bit of basic sleight of hand doesn't do it for you anymore. How about this? Better. That still count as a slight of hand trick? I guess so. I'm sorry. It felt more impressive in my head. I'll tell you what. Next time we see each other I'll have a better trick ready? How's that sound? Hi, guys. I know it's been awhile since you last heard from me. I hope this message finds its way to you. I don't think I'm writing to apologize. I'm not writing for forgiveness either. Maybe what I did was wrong and irresponsible. Maybe your parenting left a lot to be desired. I don't know. But I do miss you guys a lot. I want to see you again. Even if it's just for a day, the three of us. I hope you haven't forgotten about me. I hope it was my doing not yours. I hope there's some love left inside. I'm not sure if you'll receive this message. I'm praying you haven't moved. If I don't get a reply, I'll assume you've moved on. I'll get over it. It's my fault just as much as it is yours. If you do reply, tell me everything. Tell me how life has been these past years. Tell me what adventures life has taken you on. I want to know everything. Maybe then we can begin again. Earlier today I read a poem that reminded me of us. I think it's the reason I'm writing to you. I would like if you read it too. You'll wait a long, long time for anything much to happen in heaven beyond the floats of clou-. What the fuck? Hey. Saw your truck in the driveway. Hope I'm not intruding. Oh, sorry, Ryan. You must be Catherine. I knew your parents, the Moores, Tanya, Andrew, I stopped by periodically. Once a week, I guess. Pull weeds, mow the lawn, make sure there's no intruders. What are you doing? Hey, I'm sorry to bother you.
