United King Films present A Lama Films Production A film by Michal Aviad WORKING WOMAN Hi. Hey. -That took a long time. -Yeah. How was it? The boss was the commanding officer at my base. -Really? -Yeah. -Did he remember you? -Totally. He remembered I was hard-working. Wow, smells like oregano in here. Rosemary. Well? He needs someone to help him, to be his assistant. He?s building a high-rise by the sea. It?s an amazing project. No normal working hours, but lots of possibilities to advance. I?ll be learning a profession at his expense. What do you mean, no normal working hours? If I do well, there are bonuses. That?s real estate. He said the sky?s the limit. -It?s stuck again! -Turn it off and on again. It doesn?t work. We need a new one. It wants to die already. -Okay. -Come on! When we finish paying for the fridge, we?ll get you a new computer. Careful, Inbal. Yasmine, honey. What are you doing? You?re so annoying... Whoa. Wow. -It?s a skyscraper. -Yeah. Twenty-eight stories. Tomer, come here. Come here. Come to Mommy. Nunie, is this the right time to learn a new profession? What if it doesn?t work out? -Okay, go. -Stop it, Tomer! Then I?ll find another job. We just opened the restaurant two months ago. Shouldn?t you find a regular job until things level out? Ofer, he?s giving me a chance. I?m wiped out, but I have to get back to the restaurant. Well? What do you think? The next station is Eli Cohen Street. Benny?s in a meeting. Let me know if you have everything you need in your office. Benny?s a great boss, thank God. I?ve been with him for 15 years, when we were still doing realty. I?ve always been with him. Your office. -Is there anything I forgot? -No. I?m brewing some ginseng tea. -Want some? -Okay. I?ll let you settle in. -Welcome. -Good morning. Let me introduce you. -Shaul Geichman. -Hi. He?s in charge of banks and loans. This is our third project together. -My cousin, Attorney Avi Frisch. -Hi, nice to meet you. -Efrat works with all three of us. -I see. Orna will work with me on Rishon Beach. Who did you last work for, Orna? -I wasn?t in real estate. -What do you mean? I was in... Orna, grab the laptop and come to my office. Sure. What?s going on with the addition of the two stories? They need an okay from the sanitation department. Can?t we speed it up? If we don?t get it by Monday, I?ll nag them. What worries me are the sales. Yesterday the Russians canceled. -Really? -Yes. It?ll be okay. It?s not your first project. No, but Rishon is my baby. It took so much patience to make it happen. -Really? -Yes. -It?s my biggest project ever. -The biggest? The biggest and the most prestigious. Who?d believe 10 years ago that I?d build a high-rise with a sea view? -Let?s go visit the prima donna. -Let?s. It?s in your way. See, the drain will go here and come out here. Agreed? Agreed, Nasser? Great. Okay. Thanks. I just sent you a meeting invitation for two weeks from today. -I invited Gidi, too. -Okay. See you soon. -Bye. -Bye. -Shall we? -Yes. Regarding sales... I spoke to a realtor from Netanya. Her niece is in my daughter?s class. She has clients but no big seaside apartments -on the first floors. -Okay. Anyway, I convinced her to give them to you. They?re a French couple. She wants one percent if we sell. -What do you say? -One percent? I say great. No one here got close to getting any French clients. But we?ll see. It?s hard to get the French out of Netanya. -I?ll schedule a meeting. -Okay. Why is the project called Rishon Beach? You don?t like it? Not really. It might be possible to change it. Maybe something to do with the flowers that grow here. -Have you seen how pretty they are? -Yeah. Havazelet Beach? -Lily Beach sounds more tempting. -Why "Lily"? -That?s the name of the flower in English. -Lily Beach... Lily Beach. Good one. Mind if I make a comment? Go ahead. You?d look good with your hair down. Okay. Speaking of hair, do I need a haircut? I don?t know. Maybe. I don?t know. Then I have no choice. Sari says I need one. Seven or eight would be perfect. Of course I spoke to him. Yes. No, no. It?s a done deal. Benny Almog isn?t just anybody. So you?ll make the final arrangements? Great. -Okay, thanks. Bye. -Let?s go. I arranged a meeting with the French clients. The ones I told you about. Monsieur and Madame Benayoun. They want to meet you. You work fast, huh? I want you in on it. We?ll start preparing first thing in the morning. Sure. He?ll send me all his demands tonight. How?d you manage to get them out of Netanya? I told them we?re closer to the airport. As if Netanya?s so wonderful. Isn?t Rishon in the Holy Land? Rishon is as Holy Land as it gets. You said they?re religious. Got a nice skirt to wear? Something long, modest? That too. But it should be attractive, too. Chic. Let?s show them that Rishon is classy, too. Sure. Does he reimburse you for the clothes he asks you to buy? He doesn?t ask. I just don?t have anything classy. Classy? -That?s very classy. -Classier. You?re always classy. Too bad you can?t wait. The sales start in two weeks. I have a meeting tomorrow, Mom. -It?s important. -What kind of meeting? A meeting. Someone I brought in. -You brought in? -Yeah. You?ve been there for two months. I hardly see you. Can?t you tell me? -Mom, are you really interested? -Of course I am. In my day we didn?t switch jobs all the time. I?ve had the same day care center for 20 years... I couldn?t move ahead there. This is my chance... to give my kids a chance. Hi. What?s up? She has a fever, she won?t let me put her down. What?s going on? Sweetheart... -Did you give her Tylenol? -Yes, of course. Come, sweetie, let?s go to bed. You?re not feeling well? Here we go. Into bed. Come. Come to Mommy. Is her fever down? A little. Benny was really happy about the French clients I got. -Yeah? -Yeah, they?re coming tomorrow. I have to help him prepare. What?ll we do tomorrow? I dunno. We?ll see. I withdrew 1,000 shekels today to pay Bokovza back. -Really? -Yeah, and today was really slow. It has been four months since we opened. I wrote a postdated check for Yasmine?s dental work. What?s that? What?d you buy? My mom bought it for me. I need clothes for work. Leah?s such a sweetheart. Show me. Try it on. Yeah? There?s this... and it goes with this... Wow! -Then there?s this blouse... -Try it on. Like this. I like your hair like that. Really? Nunie... you have to get up. Come on. She still has a fever. Stay with her. We have that meeting today. We have to get ready. But she?s sick. Why don?t you take her to the restaurant? What?s come over you, Nunie? You want Rashid to take care of her? Have a nice day, beautiful. Yasmine, put Tomer?s shoes on. Honey, you?re not dressed yet? Get up, sweetie. That a girl. You?re feeling better, aren?t you? Here. Let?s give you some of this... Just a sec. Here. Okay? The whole thing... Now you?ll be just fine. Let?s take this off. Here we go... Very good. Let?s put this on... That?s it. One arm. Hurry up. Great. Other arm... You?ll feel better soon. That?s it. Okay? Ready? Yes, honey? Your turn. Freshly-squeezed Israeli orange juice. Is it correct? Only you?ll be there and the blue of the sea. It looks closer to the beach than the place in Netanya. It?s gorgeous. We did a great job. You did. Sorry I screwed up. Live and learn. You?ll see that we sold it. -Yes? -Yes. Okay. -To Lily Beach. -To Lily Beach. How do you know French? I remember a little from school. It?ll help us. I?m sorry, Orna. -Hi. -What?s up? -How was it? -Okay. Did you sell it or not? Yeah, we sold it. Really? That?s amazing. That?s great. What?s wrong? You okay? Yeah. We sold it, and it went great. Then let?s go to bed. I don?t know. Okay, bye. Listen, Benny. -I... -I?m sorry. Orna, I?m sorry. I apologize. I need to tell you... -Maybe you misunderstood me. -Well, now I understand. It won?t happen again. -I?m a married woman, Benny. -I?m married, too. I don?t know what came over me. I really am sorry. -I?m just afraid that... -Afraid that what? Orna, look at me. Are you afraid of me? We?re a good team, aren?t we? I promise. Promise. Don?t you trust me? Let?s keep going. We?ll forget about it much sooner than you think. -I want Mommy to wipe me. -Mommy can?t right now. I?m on good terms with his secretary, don?t worry. I want Mommy! Only Mommy! I?ll email him back. No, no, it?s okay. I spoke to Tammy about all the papers. Sure, talk to Tammy. I?ll take care of it tomorrow... Wait, wash your hands. No, Benny... Okay. Yes, yes, it?s... Let me wash you! It?s not a problem. Sure. Of course, Benny. Of course. It can wait. I discussed that with Meital. No problem. So we?ll talk tomorrow? We?ll talk tomorrow, okay? All right, Benny. Great. Okay, tomorrow. Bye, bye. -Sorry. We?re under crazy pressure. -Okay, but we?re waiting for you. We want to eat. -Stop playing with the rice. -Here. -A meatball for Tomer... -What?s that face for, Inbal? -Yuck. -How can you say that? Daddy worked on it all day. -Can I have a cheese sandwich? -Don?t you want any? But Daddy made a delicious meal. -I want a cheese sandwich, too. -Get them some cheese. If it?s so delicious, let Daddy eat it. What?s his problem? Doesn?t he have a life? How was work? Very slow. Did you get the business license? I don?t want to talk about it. Tomer, tell Mommy what you want for your birthday. Oh, how sweet. They sent a picture of you and their annoying lawyer. Huh. Oh... A call from home. Hello? I?m at work. I can?t understand you, sweetie. Stop crying. Oh, no. I forgot. I?m sorry, sweetie, I forgot. I?ll still help you. When I get home, I?ll do all the links and pictures for you. Okay? I?ll do it tonight... or... It?ll be ready in the morning. Sorry, honey. Sorry. Bye. Did you promise your daughter something? Yeah. She has a paper to write, "I am an Israeli." So... I promised to add links and pictures. I forgot. I forget everything. Then leave at 4:00. We?ll cancel the meeting and go home. No way. We already postponed it. We?ll make it up to him. Don?t worry. Go. That?s more important. This is the Planning and Building Department. Ashkenazi?s office is down there. -Ashkenazi runs the planning. -Got it. -Morning, Hila. -Morning. -Hey, Ducky! What?s up? -Hey! -All good? -Great. -Did you get the car? -Of course. -This is Orna. -Hi. Orna, Ducky. -Look what I got you. -Nice one! -From New York. -Thanks. Hi. Hi, Nachmias. How are you? -Meet Orna. -Nachmias. -Hello. -He?s got what you need. And this is Ashkenazi. A real character. Good morning, Mr. Architect. -Busy, sir? -Always. How are you, Mr. Almog? Thank God. Got a minute for us? Have a seat. This is Orna. You spoke to her on the phone. Here?s the nag in 3D. -Hello, Orna. -Nice to meet you. What do you need? We?re wondering what?s happening with the permit for the two stories. Ashkenazi, I?ve got demand and no supply. Benny, this isn?t your first time here. You need a change in zoning. Could take a long time. But still...? It?s a Mitzvah. We?re trying to divert the wave of French immigrants from Netanya to Rishon. See, we care about the city. Look, I did everything I could. When?s your next meeting? In a week or two. Ashkenazi, I want to hear from you. -Thank you. -Thanks. Bye. Nice vase. My wife made it. She?s a ceramicist. -Your wife? Really? -Yeah. Wow. It?s beautiful. Benny, wouldn?t this be a nice Passover gift? Just what we were looking for. It really is lovely. Twenty-five or 30 of these, and we?re taken care of. We could give it to the new buyers. Nicer than a bottle of wine, isn?t it? Do you have your wife?s business card? -Nice going. -It just came to me. To you it comes naturally. -Can I ask you something? -What? -Nothing to do with this. -Shoot. My husband?s trying to get a business license with no success. -You think Ashkenazi could help? -No, it?s a whole different department. Bye. Bye. I want to talk to you. Okay. Can you come to my office? -I need to finish this first. -Okay. But I want to talk to you. No, thanks. We?re a good team, Orna. Don?t you think? Are you happy here at work? Very. It?s time you were promoted. I?ve given this a lot of thought, and Geichman agrees with me. You should manage our sales. We?ve done well, but it?s not going as fast as we planned. I don?t know what you?ll do with those morons at the site, fire them for all I care, but I want you on it. Benny, thank you. You?ll get 0.3% of every apartment you sell. But I?m giving you a raise now, 8,000 shekels a month against future premiums. Benny, thank you so much. You deserve it. Still, thank you. He wants me to manage sales. It?s 0.3% on every sale and 8,000 against future sales right now. Yes! It?ll buy us time for the restaurant. Hi. Halva ice cream, please. Yes, babe. Thanks. Feed and bathe them. I?ll put them to bed, okay? I have a few more things to do. Okay, babe. Love you. -Thanks. Bye. -Thank you. -I deserve it today. -For sure. Still here? You can go. I ordered us sushi. Really? Yes. We work hard. Don?t we deserve it? Okay. Does your husband know? Know what? That his wife is the bomb and she?ll go far. Actually, I promised Ofer I?d be home early. You can?t. The sushi will be here soon. Yeah. Oops. Can you turn on the light? Sorry. Accident. Turn the light on, Benny. -Then promise you?ll wait for the sushi. -Benny, turn on the light! It?s stressing me out. It?ll be here soon. Can?t you take a joke? I?m sorry. What? Are we doing something wrong? -Is it a crime to enjoy our jobs? -Stop it. Okay, sorry. Thank you. So I can?t joke around with you? Since when do you cook in the middle of the night? Shouldn?t I? I was thinking... Why don?t you ask him for the money up front? The bank won?t give me another loan. We miscalculated how long it?d take to get the restaurant going. I need a few more months. You?re doing well, right? Yeah. At least you?d get something from Benny. Orna, we need the money. Can you ask him? If not, I?ll close down and go back to work at the Plaza. Orna! -Orna! -Just a sec. What?s going on? -I?m packing up. -Packing up? I?m moving to the site. You wanted me in sales, didn?t you? Keep working from here. It?s going fine. Come on, Benny. You taught me that nothing works by remote control. I have to be there. I rented you a car. You can go there whenever you want. -Really? -Yes. Wow. A car would be awesome. But no, I have to be there. I have to meet every potential client. We?ll see. Let?s go now. Where to? I want you with me. Where? At the site. Benny, I have a lot to do here, okay? I have to show you something, okay? Then we?ll have lunch at Ofer?s restaurant. Go on, make a reservation. -You want me to call? -No. Then go ahead, lighten up. Come on. Benny. I?m wearing high heels, and no way will I bring clients here. Please, just come with me. I have to show you something. Besides, Nasser is waiting upstairs with the coffee. Now, wasn?t this worth it? -Hi, babe. -Hi. -Hello. -Hi. I?ve been begging her to bring me here, and today I said, "That?s it, we?re eating at Ofer?s." Ofer, Benny. Nice to meet you. Did the municipality call? Yeah, they called earlier and said the license was approved. -Awesome. -Yeah. I?m glad it worked out. -Was it your doing? -I put a word in for you with Yair. That Yair gave us hell. -Thanks. -Glad to help. Come on, Ofer, spoil us a little. I?m counting on you. Thanks, Benny. My pleasure. Excuse me. -What are you doing? Go sit with him. -I want to help. Hi. How?s it going? Did I ask you to get your boss involved? You think I can?t manage? All I said was that you?re having trouble with the license. Keep him out of my business. Tough business, huh? Yeah, takes people a while to get used to something new. -You pickle yourself? Fantastic. -I?ll take that. I make everything myself. Delicious. I just got the go-ahead. For the meeting in Paris with your French clients. The second weekend of June. This is delicious. Thanks. -The Benayouns. -Yeah. Spelt dough with mushrooms. -Thanks, hon. -The sauce is a little spicy. We?re going. Lamb cutlets with walnuts. Careful, it?s hot. And rice with cashews and a dash of truffles. We?ll see, Benny. I have to make sure it?s after the sales fair. I gave you the date. Work around it. It?s not that simple. I have to make sure we have enough options there. Tell them we?ll be there. We?ll schedule individual meetings. Where? Paris. With her premium, she?ll make a killing. -Good morning. -Good morning. You?re here early, aren?t you? I?m meeting Nasser. He?s running late. I bought some halva rugelach. I remember you like halva. -Want some coffee? -No, I just had some. I?ve been here a while. I showed an American couple around. And? I think it?ll be okay. I?m making myself coffee. Will you sit with me? No, I have a meeting with Meital. Meital? Sari?s throwing me a birthday party on Thursday. We?d love you and Ofer to come. Okay. Did you talk to the Millers? lawyer? He isn?t taking my calls. What a pain. Then forget it. Don?t call him anymore. If he calls, tell him to speak to me directly. -Okay. -And that?s that. Talk to Jerome, tell him we?d like another meeting with him. I feel like... Thanks. -...we?re not connecting, okay? -Yeah. If not, tell me, and I?ll talk to him. What am I doing on Monday? -You?re showing people around... -Okay. -starting at 10:00. -Yes. So... -Showing people around. -Right. Benny, you don?t have to email him. I spoke to him. It?ll be taken care of. Yes... I told... Yes, I told him. Fine. Can we discuss this tomorrow? It?s 10:30, and I?m exhausted. I promise it?ll be okay. Good night, Benny. Good night. Bye. Wow, what a house. -Hi. -Hi. -Thanks. -Thanks. How old is Benny, a hundred? More or less. I?m so not into this. Come on, Nunie, let?s have some fun. Wow. -Hey. -Hi. -You look so pretty! -Ofer. -Hello. -Hi. Ofer. -This is my husband, Ofer. Efrat. -Nice to meet you. -Enjoy. -Thanks. -Hi, Geichman. -Hey, Orna, how are you? -This is my husband, Ofer. -Hi. -I?m Shaul. -Hi. -This is my wife, Sharon. -Hi. -Hi. -Nice to meet you. -Enjoy. -Thanks. There?s Benny. Hey! I?m so glad you came! -Hi, Ofer. Hi, Orna. -Hi. Sari! Sari! I want to introduce you. Orna, from the office. -Hi. Nice to meet you. -Sari. -I?ve heard so much about you. -Likewise. -Her husband, Ofer. -Hi. -An amazing chef. -Really? He has that restaurant in town, Oregano. -Pesto! -Oregano. Oregano. -Come check it out. -Gladly. Thanks for coming. Thank you. I see you?re all set with drinks. Have a bite, then I want to introduce you around. Sure. It?s quiet. They don?t come to bed at night... Ofer, can I steal her for a minute? -Sure. -Thanks. I want to introduce you. Friends, this is Orna. Nathan Gibstein from the Authority. David Spero from the Commission. From now on, we work for her. She?s in charge of Lily Beach... I?ll call you on Sunday. Excuse me. -Coming to dance? -Later. Come on, let?s dance. -Thank you, sir. -Bye-bye. I have to walk around a bit. -Will you manage? -Sure. All right. -Leave me the... -Great. -The trolley. I?ll have it sent up. -Okay. -Will you be back by 3:00? -Of course. -Yes? -Yes. Without you, I?m lost there. -Don?t worry. -Want an umbrella? -I have one. -It might rain. It?s all right. -Well, I?m off. -3:00 in the lobby. Don?t worry. And you?ll feel like you?re on vacation all year. Benny Almog Ltd. is proud to present Lily Beach, for a perfect life on the Rishon LeZion beach. This is Lily Beach, 20 minutes from Tel Aviv, a dream come true. -Wonderful. -Thank you. Thank you. They?re hesitant. They say Netanya has its advantages. Can you ask them to stay another minute? -I have something to add. -Yes, of course. Friends, a little of your patience. Five more minutes. Sit down, please. The lobby apartment. -Now?s the time. -Okay. I trust you. Thank you. Thank you. I grew up in Israel next to a synagogue. I know what community means. Michelle and Nadine told me that what they hope for most of all is to maintain the community bonds you?ve created here. Naturally. To celebrate the holidays together in Israel, to grow old together in Israel. -God willing. -Amen. You need a synagogue that?s active all week, where you can all get together. If you organize a group purchase of 10 apartments, we?ll devote the lobby apartment to your group. That changes everything! Dear friends, the moment has come to realize our dream, and God willing we?ll celebrate the next holiday at Charles Alarouche House on the seaside in Israel. -All together. -Amen. And if things in France get worse, at least we?ll live together in Israel. The moment has come. Amen. We?re very happy to be at your service. Thank you. -Thank you. -We?ll be here. They signed up for 12 apartments. We sold six for sure. Twenty-five apartments, and the project is sold. You were great today. Do you realize how much money you made? Did we eat anything today? -Are you hungry? -Starving. We didn?t eat all day. -Let?s eat. -Where? I don?t know. You know what? The hotel food is fantastic. Great. It?s on me. Good for you. I can see it now, Orna Haviv Real Estate. Throw me a bone when you get there. -I?ll consider it. -You?d better. -Anything else? -No, I?ve had enough. -Cognac? -No, no. You sure? The check, please. Oh, it?s on me this time. I forgot. It?s okay. -You?ll have other chances. -No, it?s on me. Hold on to your money. Thank you. -Tired? -Exhausted. Off you go, Cinderella, to bed. Thank you. There are no hotels in Rishon? -Rishon? -Rishon. -Who?d come to Rishon? -Oh, Benny... -What? -The Benayouns? friends, -when they come to visit. -You know what? -Not a bad idea. -I?m on it, Benny. The next thing. Good night. Need help with that? -I don?t know... -Here, I?ll help you. Wrong card. Stupid cards. What?s wrong with keys? Yeah. Here you go. Good night. Orna, -since you?re here... -No, I?m not here. -One last drink. -No, no, no. -A nightcap. -No, no. Come on. Wasn?t it a great day? -It was fun and I?m going to sleep. -Come on. -No, no, Benny. -Why not? -Please. -No. -Please. -Stop it. Please... -What do you care? -I care. -A little drink. -No. Wasn?t it a great day? -It was amazing. -And the sales? -No, Benny, I?m serious. -What do you care? -I care. Benny! -Orna, please. -Benny, no. -Orna... -No! -Don?t drive me crazy. -Benny! -Orna, you drive me wild. -No, Benny! -You drive me wild. -You drive me wild. -Benny... No... You just drive me wild. This hasn?t happened since I was a kid. You drive me crazy. Mommy! Hi, my babies. Did you buy me the model plane? Did you buy me the Rubik?s Cube I asked for? Mommy, please. I wanted the Rubik?s Cube. -I bought everything. -Yes! -Come here, come here. -Yes! Yes! Thank you, Mommy! Thank you, Mommy! I?ll put it together right now. Yay! You awake? No, I?m going back to sleep. I don?t want to wear those! It worked out in the end with Tomer?s blue pants. What a drama. Did you sleep? -I need help today. -Of course. As long as things are working out. They are working out, right? This needs washing. -I?ll put these in the wash. -Whatever. Orni... what?s going on? Orni, sweetheart. Talk to me. My baby... Something happened in Paris. I made a mistake. At work? No. With my boss. Sweetheart... we all make mistakes. You were in Paris, you went too far, it?s history now. No... -Mom, it?s not... -The kids?ll be late. Yasmine, get Inbal and Tomer. I?ll deal with them. You get ready. Here?s our champ! -Here she is, in the flesh. -Bravo! Didn?t I tell you, Shaul? You sure did. You two are great together. -Congratulations, Orna. -Did you have any doubts? -Orna is amazing! -Fantastic. -Nice going. -Good job, Orna. Bravo. Guys, we?ll postpone our meeting, Orna and I have a few things to take care of, okay? -No problem. -Thanks. -Thanks, Nasser. -Bye. No, no, no. I missed you. You drove me crazy there. Benny, I wanted to ask you... about the payment for what we sold in Paris, and... -You?re so beautiful. -Stop it, Benny. I can?t. You can?t what? You can do anything, Orna. Can?t you see we?re a winning couple? -No, I... -Eight apartments, just like that. -What I wanted to ask... -Do you realize what happened in Paris? Do you realize what you did? -Benny, I... -Forget it. You?re tired. We?ll keep working on the project. It?s all good. I have to go do something, okay? Okay. -What?s the matter? -Nothing. Give it here. -It?s okay. -Give it here. Damn it! -What?s with you? -There won?t be any advance. -What? -I?m not asking him for the money. Okay. We have to figure out how we?ll manage. I?m through with that place. It?s over. -Why? -Because I don?t want to see him again. Did he do something to you? Nunie, did he do something in Paris? Yes. -In Paris. -I?ll kill that bastard. What did he do to you? Did he use force? Yes. No, he didn?t... What did he do? Wait. I?m trying to... We were... at a restaurant. He was drinking and so was I, but I wasn?t drunk. And then... I was tired, I wanted to go to my room... So I went to my room and... I just tried to help him get in. And I went into his room... and he shut the door. Then he took out his thingy. And it didn?t work. What do you mean, it didn?t work? Did you try to help him? No. -Did you have sex? -No. Did he touch you? Did you touch him? He touched you and... then what? Did you stay? Yes. Why? Why didn?t you punch him? Why did you stay? I don?t know. I knew it. I knew it. Son of a bitch. I understand you?re looking for a sales rep. -Lately I?ve been working for... -Wait. Aren?t you Orna? Benny?s Orna? Orna Haviv. Yes. I saw you at Benny?s party. So? What happened? We just got back from a very successful trip to Paris, but I?m looking for a job with regular hours. Okay. You know we don?t sell to the upper class here. Of course... It?s okay. I know the ropes. I can sell to Israelis of all kinds. Great. Mind if I have a word with Benny? It?s an opportunity to say hello. Orna, where did you disappear to? Listen, if you come back and finish selling the project, I promise to give you a fat bonus. I promise you, you won?t regret it. Call me. Bye. Orna! Orna! Benny... Benny... I need you to write me a recommendation. I want to leave. A recommendation? Are you kidding me? Benny, I need a recommendation. Without it, I can?t get a job, and I need to work. Orna, there won?t be any recommendation. Consider my offer. I?ll be waiting. No, I need that letter. I need you to send it to me. Benny! I need a recommendation. I need to work! I need to work, Benny! Shira, I was late and the kindergarten is closed. Did you pick up Tomer? Never mind. Bye. Where?s Tomer? -What? -Where?s Tomer? I took him to Grandma?s day care. And Inbal is at Neta?s. Was Paris the first time? Where were you? Did you see my messages? Was Paris the first time he touched you? Give me the towel. Did he see you like this? No. I don?t get it. He suddenly jumped on you? You suddenly made him horny? He tried to kiss me. In Paris? Hanukkah, last winter. Hanukkah? What have you been doing since then? Working. Why didn?t you tell me? You?ve been kissing him for six months? No, he tried to kiss me. I got away. What do you mean, he tried? People don?t just try. If you didn?t want it, it wouldn?t have happened. I didn?t want it. You think I wanted something from him? Then what?ve you been doing since Hanukkah? Working! Working hard, supporting our family. Bringing money home. And now I know how. Ofer! Ofer! Ofer, come home. We need you. This makes no sense. Why didn?t you tell me? Why didn?t you just tell me? We never hid anything from each other. I?ve been sitting here for hours... You go there every day... you come home and don?t say a word. Why didn?t you say something? "Orna Haviv... is a dedicated... professional..." "Orna is... an employee..." "Orna won?t let... anything..." "Orna is a stupid... dumb idiot... who lets anything..." "Orna... Haviv... is one of the most... professional employees... with excellent... marketing skills. Orna... is an asset... to anyone... who employs her." Yes? Hi, Sari. Orna, from Benny?s office? We met at his birthday party? Of course. Come on in. Benny didn?t tell me you were coming. Benny! He wasn?t at the office. Benny! -Coffee? -No thanks. I just have to get him to sign something. Call you right back. Hello. What? You have to sign something for me... Sure you don?t want something to drink, Orna? Actually, coffee would be great. -Milk? Sugar? -Milk, please. I?ll make one for you too, Benny. What the hell do you think you?re doing? I need this letter. You forgot who taught you everything. This is your thanks? Sign it. We?ll talk about percentages later. -Percentages? -Yes. Orna, this isn?t urgent. I?ll come in on Sunday, and then I?ll decide whether to sign. No, you?ll sign it now. I have a job interview tomorrow. I?m quitting. I was offered a job with easier hours. -You know how it is with little kids. -Of course. Family comes first. Benny can be demanding. Yes, but he wrote me a really good recommendation. He can be supportive when he has to. Go ahead, Benny, sign it. She has little kids at home. Are you going to do it? Benny. Can you get me a pen? I learned a big lesson working with you. Good luck. Thanks.
