Tango Foxtrot closing in, attempt is 100 yards. You have to go. I repeat, you have to go. Target is on the other side of this clearing. Petro, Vandewege, go on. Take the right. Snowden and Silva, you're with me. We got this, brother. We always got this. It's hard. It's hard. Taking fire! - Daddy? - Hmm? - You'll help them? - Help who, honey? Those children, they're sad. For just 30 cents a day. Less than one cup of coffee. What does your daddy do for a living? Child protection. So, what do you think I wanna do? Help them? Exactly. Hello, everybody, And thank you for coming out today. Now being a more than occasional reader... Why'd you do that? There's a lot of bad things going on in the world, babe. Got to protect energy at this house at all costs. You know what? Let's go get dressed so we can have some breakfast. Bring it in. Shh. Father God, thank you for this meal and thank you for this moment. Being able to eat what we want when we want, where we want and with whom we want. Thank you. - Amen. - Amen. And please, Lord, help Daddy save the sad children inside the bad places. That's really sweet of you. And Lord, please bring Mommy home. Amen. Amen. Some of you have preferred to be smug and greedy, but let me ask you, would someone greedy build this? Come on, man. This store is more than just a store. Nelson's is a symbol... A symbol of all the opportunity I've created and provided. You had 18 years, Pops. I'll make sure he pays for this. Hey, girl, what's up? I'm at work. You good? Yeah. Calling to see if you want to have cousins dinner tonight. It's your birthday, chica. - Sunny, my birthday was a week ago. - What? We can still celebrate. I'll try, but I'm buried in bile over here. All right, well, if not, at least come by in the morning. Sam's doing his big giveaway tomorrow. In fact, bring Kyle with you. Oh, yeah. I'm sure he'd love that. - I'll try to make it, okay? - Okay. - Bye, chica. - Bye bye. Sunny says hi. - Tell her I said hello. - Uh-huh. I got a call from a guy who says he has a little Spanish boy, parents just disappeared. Just wondering if you could go with me in the morning to help me with Spanish a little? Yeah, sure thing. I'm gonna head out early. Got some stuff I need to take care of at the house. Please consider more security if you want to keep doing these public appearances, Sam. You're all the security I need, Sparks. I don't want to seem like a big shot surrounded by a bunch of suits. You know, we're going for a man of the people. Think, it's an election year and my customers are my voters and they love me and they love getting their shit for cheap. They're saying it's getting kind of dangerous out there, isn't it? - I'm not the President. - Yeah, but you're on your way to. Well, let's put it this way. Americans are crazy, but they're not that crazy. So, what do you wanna do about Kyle? We're just going to swing by, pick up Angel and Kyle always has a bug up his ass or something. Yeah. Grandpa. Where's your dad? Inside, asleep. Kyle just... Sparks, stay with her. Kyle, Angel is out there completely unsupervised, all on her own. Is she ready to go? What the hell are you doing here? Uh, for the slumber party at Grandpa's house. You know, before the promotion at the store tomorrow morning. Okay, I get it. Well, you don't care because I'm the man who married your mother so you hate me. So it's okay. I'll deal with it. But, Jesus, Kyle, don't let her see you like this. Get him out. I know he's got a gun on him. I don't like guns in my house. Get him out. Kyle, I know your wife left you, and that sucks. I get it. But Angel's mother left her, and that sucks more, okay? That's what you have to think about now, son. And drinking like this. You never even used to drink at all. - Do you know what your mother would say? - Don't talk about my mother. The kind of hell she would raise if you saw you - in this condition. - Don't talk about my mother Kyle, your mother was grateful for everything I did. I took you both out of poverty. You're the man in war because of me. Where do you come up with all this shit? You know what, Kyle? I think you need to find your purpose again. A purpose is what makes a man great. I had a lot of shit on my mind. I'm doing the best I can. Yeah. You know, what scares me, Kyle, is sometimes your best is the worst I've ever seen. All right. Let's do this. So Janine just left? No reason, no nothing? Nope, nada. Wow. Is Angel okay? Yeah, she's okay. I mean, this all gets difficult at times but... Guess it's a blessing that she's still so young. You know that's not how that works. I'm sorry. - I'll shut up. - It's okay. You're just looking out for her. It's why you're so good at your job. I can't help myself. I just wanna save every kid I can. We help them. We don't save them. That's the way we have to think of this in order to survive. I know you don't believe that. You know who Saint Christopher is? They say he carried a child across a dangerous river. They got to the other side, that child revealed himself to be Jesus. So now Saint Christopher is known as the patron saint of safe journeys. I think we've got to be like him. We have to believe that every single child out there is worth saving. Here. - Take this. - Clove... - No. - You're on a rough journey right now. Maybe this will help. Thank you. You're the child services people. I'm the caseworker you spoke to earlier. Yes. This is my colleague. Clove Martinez. About time you got here. So is the child injured, hungry? - Afraid? - What do you mean? I didn't hurt him, all right. I didn't cook breakfast for the kid, - but he didn't ask for anything. - Okay, sir. Let's calm down. Okay? What the fuck you talking about? I'm calm. Sir, do not talk to my colleague like that. Me and you spoke earlier. You said that the parents left the child in your custody, right? It's just a dad and a kid, but the dad freaks out, disappears. Where's the kid now? Somewhere inside. I keep him in the basement. - If I let him up... - You keep him in the basement? But he's got a knife. He tried to hurt me. All right? What if he tries to use one of my guns? You keep guns in the house with a child? It's my God damn house. If you don't like it, you can get this kid out of my house right now. - What's the child's name? - Manny. Manny. Come on out, kid. - Don't yell at the kid, okay? - I'm not yelling. I'm not asking. That's an order. Stay right here. You see him? Is that him? Manny... is that knife to keep you safe? His dad gave it to him for protection. Manny, listen. You can keep the knife. It's okay, all right? We're here to help. My mom died. My dad brought me to America. He said that if anything happens, Just stay with the man until he comes back. But the man is mean. Listen, tell him we're going to do whatever we have to do to help you to get back to your father, okay? Okay, come on out. Christ sake, are you leaving or what? Huh? Get this kid out. Shut the fuck up. You understand me? - I'm not playing with you. - Kyle, stop. Calm down. I'm calm. Go, go, go. Excuse me, sir. Hi. I don't think repairs were scheduled for today. You are correct. Just a work mix up. But we're already done. Clothes and food is on us, little man. You're a hero. How do you say, "Little strong man"? That's you. Are we gonna let him keep that knife? Let's just get him some food. We'll take care of the knife in a minute, okay? - Let's go to Nelson's. - Clove, no. - Nelson's is right there, Kyle. - They're not even open yet. Come on. He's hungry. - Send the bill to Sam. - You know how I feel about Sam. Ever since I got back, he calls me weak and a freaking coward. What happened to you over there? You know you can trust me. It's the worst moment of my life. Thank you. Just breathe. Breathe. Please, please, please. You're the only person I've ever told that to. I am so sorry you had to experience that. You know what? Since we're so close, let's just get him something to eat. We'll be in and out. But you're paying. - Can I help you? - You're the manager? Yes. My name is Sunshine. Is there a problem? I'm Mr. Nelson's press manager. Can you please do something about them? I don't want the camera picking them up. You want me to tell my employees to stop doing their jobs? Well, they're Sam Nelson's employees, so, yes. They'll be done and out of the way by the time we open. - Eagan. - Who? This high school kid Sunny used to tutor back in the day. He tells her, he's living in the woods. He wants her to live with them. She called the cops. She never saw him again. Come on, little man. It couldn't be him. He disappeared years ago. It's probably just somebody who looks like him. She okay though, right? Yeah. What's it with the service? I'm getting no signal. - I need my phone. - There are full bars all the time. - I don't know why our phone... - You should provide wifi then. Yeah. Hey, - Hi - Welcome. Hi. I'm so sorry, I missed your birthday Oh, my God. - Good to see you. - Hey. We have a hungry young man here. Oh, well, food will be ready any time. You want to just go wander around? Yeah. Hey, Sunshine, our clepto in Home Dec is stuffing her pockets again. Oh, yeah. I'm getting her this time Gotcha. You little shit. Hey, whoa, whoa. You and I are gonna have a little talk. What are you doing? Let go of me! I was just putting returns back. Come with me. Now. What is happening? I don't understand. - You don't understand. - No. Sit. Do you know how long I've been trying to catch you in the act? What are you talking about? You're on camera, sweetie. Now, do I need to call the police or are you gonna show me everything you have on you? Seriously? There's more. I know there's more. Serial killers, pirate radio, Halloween... I don't know. Sunny and I watched it. Fun movie. Definitely not for kids. Not on my watch. Nope. Let me check this rack. Wow. The hero always gets the girl. Howdy, everyone. This is the one and only, Sam Nelson. May I have all the employees up front? All the employees up front. Wow. - Are you gonna fire me. - Um, yeah. Hey, Sunshine. You there? - What's up, John? - Did you put a lock on the back door? What lock? We're about to open the door. Everybody up front. Well, look who's here. Raffles, giveaways, the whole shebang, same thing we do every year. I want you on top of your game. Angel! You got any parents I can call? I'm a foster kid, all right? Is that your excuse for being a thief? - What the hell? - Shit. Rainey, where are you? Shit. Oh. You okay? Back against the wall, let's go! Clove? Clove. - Sam, we're blocked. - What about the side exit? Follow me. Good job, everybody. Way to to follow orders Attention shoppers. Nelson's is now mine. And you all belong to me. Doors are packed with C4. If you try to open them, you will level this building. But you can survive all of this if you do as I say. Everyone must come to the front of the store now. If you hide, we will find you, and you will be shot. You hear me, Sam Nelson? I know you were here. - Come out, come out, wherever you are Sammy boy. - No. You're not going anywhere. We stay put. Oh, I almost forgot. I am also wearing a suicide vest. The button in my hand will detonate everything if for any reason, my thumb is raised of his button. For example, if I'm attacked or killed. So be wise and do as I say. Front of the store. You have one minute. What do we do, Sparks? They're looking for you, Sam. For all we know, it's to kill you. Sam. You're a bargaining tool. Play ball and they'll let us go. - Yeah. No, I know. - No. Absolutely not. Yeah, she's right. I can't leave the employees out there on their own. Okay. But stay right next to me. The moment I think they're going to shoot, get out of my way. Come on. No signal. We're trapped in here. We should go. No, we're staying right here. The door is reinforced. - Call 911. - The line is dead. Okay. Something like this is a good chance that police are already on their way. They may even be outside already. What are you doing? What are you doing? Look, my wife and my cousin are out there. I won't leave the one safe place we have if there's a chance of me getting them in here with us, okay? - Okay? You understand? - Uh-huh. Okay. You ready, okay? - Where's Sunny? - She's somewhere in the store hiding. She's here. Okay. Don't die, please. I'm not gonna let you die, okay? Stay with me, Clove. Stay with me. You. Move over there. Now. Stop trying to move. Now! Get against the wall. I told you to stop trying. Don't be shy. Come on down. Come on. Join the family. Kyle, you have to save Manny. I'm gonna get him out of here. Come out. Come out. Manny, no! Let's go. I'm not leaving her. - Move. - No... Manny. Let's go! Faster. Let's go. Everything okay? Yeah, some little shit ran into the store. - He was scared for his life... - Shut up. Angel. Just stay right there, okay? I don't see anybody. Sunshine. - Sunshine, please. - Mikki? Please. Thanks. Hurry. Come here. You're okay. You're safe. Where is Sam Nelson? Our great Congressman, Sam Nelson. The multimillionaire founder of Nelson's Corporation. Businessman Sam Nelson. Loyal friend, father, grandfather and foodie. Step aside. Sparks, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay, Sparks. Congressman. Right this way. Go with Sophie. Where's the cameraman? The one in black. - Start recording now. - What is this, God damn it? - It's confession time, Congressman. - What? Confess what? You're going to look into that camera and tell the world that you framed your business partner. I don't have a business partner. You admit to what you did or all these people die. I don't know what the hell you're talking about. - Tell us about Luther Raize. - Luther Raize? Jesus, he embezzled money from me. I haven't thought about that loser in 20 years. - What are you doing? - Sparks. Please just think about my daughter. I can't risk Sam getting killed. Stop. Sparks, no! Back up. Come on. Come on. You want to blow this place up? You're bluffing. Only one way to find out, bodyguard. Daddy. Sparks, put the gun down. - He's lying, Sam. - Sparks, please. No just... Please, please. How many more people are gonna die because of you? Sunny. - Rainey. - Where are you? Rainey, thank God you're okay. We're in the security office. You have to get here. - I can't. - Let's go. Rainey. One of you is dying next. You. I got no problem with you. What? I can't hear you. What'd you say? I ain't got no problem with you. Good. You don't mind dying if Sam Nelson doesn't start talking. What's going on? Sunshine's in the security office. Ready for your confession? What's he doing? Probably delivering his manifesto. Psychotic narcissists love that shit. Exactly one hour from now, a series of blasts will bring this place to the ground... unless I see on the news, a prosecutor bring charges against Congressman Sam Nelson. Kyle. Something you know? As a sign of good faith. I will release some hostages. But if anyone tries to enter or negotiate with me, I will kill everyone. Clocks are ticking. You got that? Yeah, it recorded. All right. Here's the deal. Some of you are gonna go home. Some of you are going to stay here and help me. Any volunteers? All right. You all are staying. You get that recording to the police today. Let's go. Let's go! Move! That means you too. Nice and slow. Take Sam and the others to electronics. Wait. - I know you. - Why are you doing this? I know you. Don't I? You're the black stepson with a cute little girl who got Sam Nelson the minority vote. Me and my daughter, don't have anything to do with Sam and his politics. Tell me is that Mexican boy he yours too? - I work for Child Protective Services. - Kids don't need protection. A man like you came for me when I was a boy, and I wouldn't let him take me. I'm a product of chaos. And violence is the only voice that a man hears. You know that. I know that. So I take it this ain't your first time doing this. Come here. - Come on, baby. Just stay with your daddy. - Now. Daddy's gonna work it out. Why don't you read this? "Remembered?" Past tense? I want you to give that to the police. Today is your lucky day. You both get to go home. Everyone back. Back. That recording that needs to get out to the police. So make sure you get a copy fast. Sir, listen. I get it. You have a message. Surely we can deal for Mr. Nelson's safety. I've had criminal clients. - I've gotten very good re... - You work for Sam? I'm a personal media and communications manager, not a Nelson's employee. Because now, you belong to me. Move. Let's go. You're next. Let's go. You. Move. Listen. Everything's gonna be all right. I need you to go outside with this woman. She's gonna keep you safe, okay? What about Grandpa? I got him. I got everybody. I'm gonna go back in there, make sure everybody's okay. - Please. - Let's go, slow. Take care of her for me. Look at that. Jesus, Kyle. I swear that guy looks like my CPS officer. Y'all got one out. One out. Come on, Rainey. Where are you? I need to know you're okay. How do you know so much about people? I'm a psychologist. I moved back here to be with Rainey while she finishes veterinary school. I tried to give it a shot here, but... I knew it was a long shot but... It must be hard. Yeah. But I'd do anything for her. Did my granddaughter get out? Of course she did. Did I? No. What? Are you kidding me? You're one of my employees. I was never one of your slaves. All right, team. This is the outsourcing part of our adventure. Before I send you home, I got a little shopping I need you all to complete. Let the work set you free. Let's go. Start movin'. Turn the TV on. Oh, the lesbo. The one with Sunshine. So tell me, where is our little Sunshine? What's that little secret you're hiding from me? You are the sunshine of my life. Didn't take you as a Stevie Wonder fan. It's a Sinatra song. I stand corrected. Well, if you wanna keep standing, you better tell me where she is. I swear. I don't know where she is. I know you've been talking to her in the security office. And I know it's reinforced. We'll get her to come out one way or another. No? You're staying here with me. The scene here at the Nelson Store is escalating rapidly. While police are still securing the area, demands have already been received from inside, which suggests this very dangerous situation could come to an end quickly... You two go check the perimeter. I know the kid's still out there and I wanna make sure no one else is trying to get their way out. What we do if we find someone? Kill him. If you don't have the balls to do it, hold them till I get there. Showtime. ...act of terrorism or is it the violence of disgruntled employees? To answer that, we go to a video that has just surfaced... Our moment of truth, Sam. My name is Sam Nelson. Fifteen years ago, I framed my friend and business partner, Luther Raize. He was an innocent man, but I made sure he spent most of the rest of his life in prison. And that was only the first of my many crimes. Police are telling us that there may be up to three gunmen inside. - What do we do with all this stuff? - Shh. Exactly one hour from now, a series of blasts will bring this place to the ground. - So how'd we do? - Unless I see on the news... Good work, team. ...bring charges against Congressman Sam Nelson... Now... you take those. I'd like you to tie her up. I'd like you to tie your friend there too. Mmm. What are you doing, asshole? Give yourself up. You got it coming, old man. Next time I won't miss. I knew something was up, but he's crazier than I thought. Jeb! What are you doing? Why are you all doing this? We're gonna burn this place to the ground for what Sam did to Luther. So you're all doing all of this for Luther? - Why? - He saved us. Don't move. Don't move or I'll shoot. Do it! Oh, my God. You can't do it. You had it coming, old man. Can you hear me? Kyle, it's Sunshine. - Sunshine? - Yes. Sunshine, where are you? We're in the security office. We're safe. - Who's we? - Me, me, Mikki Foss. You know, Mikki "Sticky Fingers." You all see me right now? Totally. Why? Why are you doing this? Because all the wrong people get all the best things in life. Nice jobs. The most money. Women. And people like you get all the preference and opportunity while hardworking white men get used up and die. Preference? I go to vet school, I'm in debt, and I work at Nelson's. Not anymore. I'm gonna take everything he's got if it's the last thing I do. If it's the last thing you do. You wanna get back at him. Not at us. - Let us go. - Not yet. I want Sunshine to come and get you. Listen to me. I need you to stay right there. Don't move from that office. Hear me? Got it. Kyle, Kyle. One of them is coming toward you. What? Where? Two aisles ahead of you. Okay, get off the mic right now. Damn, he's a badass. Yeah. Everything's going according to plan. I know. And we go out before anyone knows what happened. I wanna get back to the farm. Stay true to the family. Farm it is. Let's bring Jeb and Shane with us. Where are they? Will this do any good? You got balls. Kyle, we have to be careful now, more than ever. I know, I know. Where are they? Electronics. Please tell me Clove got out. I'm so sorry, Sunny. She's gone. I promise I tried. Sunny, listen to me. We have to get everybody out. Now. He's gonna blow himself up. There's explosives all around the store. We only have 30 minutes. I need you. We need you. Hello? Sunny. He's gonna kill my stepdad and everyone connected to him. He's making some statement. He's not gonna blow himself up. What do you mean? Suicides don't take cash and jewelry. It's time for phase three. Everybody, up! Good. I see you're listening! You, you come over here! What about those two? No, you two stay. He made them take money from the registers, jewelry from the cases. If he's saying this is a suicide bombing, he's full of shit. Kyle, wait. No. - What's going on? - You have to go back. Hide. Stop! What the fuck are you all looking at? He's coming right at you. He's in Home Goods. Kyle, they're hiding at the back. No one can see you unless you walk right on top of them. What's going on? Police cut the power. It doesn't change anything. Eagan, is this the little shit you've been looking for? Found him hiding around the corner. You run away from me again and I will kill everyone. You run, boom! You got me? Don't let him out of your sight. Let's go. Now! Mikki, can you hear me? What's going on right now? They're headed off to the storerooms. Move it. I'm helping you. Don't leave me in there with everybody else. I just... Get inside. Boom. Sparks? Sparks? Man, what you doing? How did you get my gun? Long story. Shoot them. What? That bomb vest is bullshit. I've seen suicide bombers. He's lying. But what about all the other explosives? Ones on the doors look legit, but you're not gonna be shooting the doors. Sparks, if the vest is fake, why are they doing all this? Your guess is as good as mine. Maybe they're only intending on killing Sam... but you could take him out before they hurt anybody else. The neck or the back of the head. No. No. Once a Marine, always a Marine. Whatever happened to you in Afghanistan, you're still a fighter and you still know how to shoot. - I'm not doing it. - Look, look. Enough of your pussy liberal shit, brother. The world is not safe. How many bullets you got left? Empty. One in the chamber. They sell ammo here? You know you get a discount, right? You may not believe this but Sam does love you. Always has. Kyle, we need you. Kyle, are you still there? Sunny, wait. What's going on? They're headed off towards the storeroom. Go. Go. Let's go, soldier. Go. Go, soldier. He got away. I'm getting by. What is this? Look at my leg. Bring me Sunshine or you die. Where the hell's Shane? He's either dead or he's hiding. Find him. Sunshine, it's me, Kyle. Are you okay? No. I'm sorry about Clove. It's okay. I gotta get us out of here. Where is everybody? Psycho locked them up inside the storage room. He still has Nelson and Rainey in Electronics. - And that boy you were with. - Manny? - He's got Manny? - Mmm-hmm. I know you're listening to me, you sick son of a bitch. Yeah, I hear you, little piggy. And pretty soon, I'm gonna blow this house down. Tell you what. You bring me Sunshine and I'll give you two of these three. What do you say? Me? What does he want with me? He looks familiar to me. He's taking money. Means he has to get out of here before the bombs go off, right? Okay, so what do we do? We tell him to go fuck himself. Listen to her. She's smart. I promised Clove I'd save that little boy. I gave her my word. That's all I got. Kyle... Please get Rainey out. I'll handle it. I'll go get all three of them out. Y'all get the rest. Let's do it Hey, brother. Go fuck yourself! You're pathetic. No one will even remember your name in a month. Shut up. You're wrong. I'm making a statement here that's gonna outlive us all. Oh, it's time to say goodbye, Sam. No, wait, please! Boom! That's for Luther. No one is even gonna recognize your corpse, Congressman. How's that for a legacy? After you're gone and everyone thinks that I'm dead, I will be crawling through a tunnel to freedom so that I can survive and strike again. Because I am going to destroy everything you love, Sam. Watch out. Shit... Come here. Get down. What do we do? - Find the hostages and get them out of here. - Okay. Where are you gonna run to? Give me that, son. Give me the gun. Come on. Let's go. - Sunny, can you hear? Where are you? - Come on. Rain, we're going to the east exit. Go ahead and shoot, you'll all be charcoal anyway. I've had enough bad press for the day. - Come on, let's get it. - You can't just leave him! Yes, we can. Come on. Shit. This isn't one of ours. Okay. Um, I need something to cut this with. Like a... - I don't know. - Here, here, here. How about this? Oh, okay. Hey, hey. What is that? What is that? It is a bomb. Be careful. Okay. Come on, guys. Let's go. Let's go! Everybody, out. Everybody, out. Just keep going toward the door! Toward the... Okay. Come on, let's go. Given up? Tired of running? You're out of bullets. You had it coming. I told you. - Sunny. - Rain. Oh, my God. Shh. Are you guys okay? Yes, we're okay. Yes. Rainey? Where's Manny? He still has him. What are you doing? It's my job to protect him. You understand that, right? Go on, make your mother proud. But do it fast, God damn it. Jesus. Now what? We need something to pry the door open. Huh? Well, inside that door, are all the tools in the world. Go get one. Manny? Manny? Manny? He's with Eagan. He's innocent. He's got nothing to do with this. You're Sam's son. You brought him here. That makes him a part of this. I know you don't like Sam. It was Luther that was guilty. Maybe. Maybe not. Uncle Luther did it. Sam put him up to it and that makes him guilty. Uncle Luther? - That's your family? - Yeah, Uncle Luther. Rotted away in prison for 18 years. I had to raise myself, Egan had to raise himself, and somebody's gotta pay. Right now that's you. - Get that door open! - They're trying. Just shut up! You're not in charge. She may not be in charge, but I am. You are so cool. So all the precision tools in the world in this store and you pick a hammer. Nice touch. Sunshine, it's Raize. - What? - The leader, it's Eagan Raize. - Luther's son? - Kyle, are you sure it's Eagan? Clove thought she saw him in the parking lot. Now one of his gunmen confirmed it. Stop it! Shall we try someone with a brain now? Kyle, where are you? Kyle? R-A-I-Z-E. Narcissists always use their own names. We've got about ten minutes until this place blows. I have to help him. You'll need this. Let's go. Where's the little boy? I don't know. Dead maybe? Like your cousin? You killed Terry? He had it coming. You know this place is about to blow up, don't you? Tick-tock. What? Eagan, stop! You said you wanna see me? Here I am. Sunny... You look so beautiful. I know you're angry and afraid. I have a good escape plan. You don't need to do this. Everyone got out. It's over. I want you to come with me. Okay. Okay. Just let me get Kyle out first. No, you're coming with me now. Go to hell. Don't come any closer! I earned this. Earn this, you piece of shit! Hey, hey, hey, hey. You okay? Are you okay? Rainey? Oh. Manny? Come here. Time to die, you little shit. It's over. Let's get out of here. Authorities are saying the evidence against Luther Raize is ironclad, indisputable, and Sam Nelson had no wrongdoing in the matter. This was not an act of terrorism. I'm telling you, the guy's a lunatic. I mean, the idea that he had some great message is bullshit. I mean, look, the guy just wanted to steal money from my business and he... Are you gonna say something? Yeah, Sam. I quit. This was full of money ten minutes ago. I guess this means we're unemployed. Yeah. No more Nelson's. So what if you opened up your own practice? With what money? I've been doing a little saving. Mikki "Sticky Fingers." - You don't see me steal this. - She has a point. You're putting that back, right? Maybe? All right. Everything looks good. Vitals check out. You're cleared. - Thank you. - There he is. Baby. - You okay? - Yeah. Did you save them, Daddy? I gave you and Clove my word I would. I did the best I could. Looks like maybe you've found your purpose. I guess I just made it up along the way. You know, you should come by sometime. Maybe me and Angel can put a little something on the grill for you. - What do you say, Grandpa? - I'll bring the steaks. Angel. Come here, come here. I want you to say hi to Manny. Manny, this is Angel. Angel, this is Manny. Hi, Manny. Manny helped save your dad's life. I owe this little man everything. His father has been lost and, um, I'm gonna go to the courts and see if they'll let him stay with us for a while. Would you be okay with that? We're good. Okay. See, I told you private school would pay off. Somebody's gotta teach me Spanish soon.
