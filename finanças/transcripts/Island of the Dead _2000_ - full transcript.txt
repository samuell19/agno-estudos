The worms crawl out. Your eyes fall out. Your teeth decay. And that's the end of a beautiful day. [MUSIC PLAYING] MELISSA (VOICEOVER): Let me tell you a story. My name is Melissa O'Keefe. When you meet me, you may find this surprising. You see, when I was an infant, I was abandoned in the streets of New York City. I was lucky. Someone found me. Now I've got a name. Some say missing persons is a step down for a cop. I don't see it that way. I connect people with names, names of people. Some of these people are lucky. When we find them, they're alive. Others aren't so lucky, but we look for them anyway. You see, names matter to me. Unknown, unknown, unidentified, unknown. This is it? This is all you have for me? We just make the lists, Sergeant. All I got on these people is what you see. You don't say too much, you know. What material are you looking for? MELISSA: Material? Sorry. Dearly departed. Three girls, 8 to 10. They disappeared while skipping rope. The Double Dutch Killings, February last year. Your people found two of them. I'm looking for the third. MAN: Of course you are. An orphan. DA needs more evidence. Well, she could always be on Hart Island, along with your skeezer hags, your ODs, your bag ladies, your shut-ins, your homicides, your unknowns. Unidentifieds always go through missing persons database before burial. So what happened here? Every once in a while one of them wiggles through. Thanks for nothing. Happy digging. They got chicks here. What's wrong with you? You on speed or something? Have too much coffee today? - What? No. Nothing. What? Regular fuckin' death rocker, aye? Yeah, that's right. OK? I got my own band and everything, you know? We got an album. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. - Whose basement? [CHUCKLE] Hey, you know, I got a name out there, OK? People know me. I got six fucking months in this dump. Where the fuck are we, anyway? You know? I mean, what is this? What is in here? - What, in here? - Yeah. - It's this. Fuck! Oh, hey, hey, hey, relax man, OK? Shit, man he's just on burial duty, man. No. No, no, no, no, no. I'm not going to any cemetery. Forget it. What? Figure with all this morbid shit you've got on, you'd feel right at home. Yeah, screw you, OK? I don't go in for this work off my time shit, right? I'm an artist, huh? Artist my ass. Let's go, boys. Let's get ready to move. Can we get a cheeseburger on the way, Mike? - Whatever you want. - Fries? You're shit. Let's go, double-time. Move! - Milk shake. [INAUDIBLE] TV ANNOUNCER: In other news, developer Rupert King and the mayor-- Well, of course the problem won't go away overnight. TV ANNOUNCER: King has promised to solve the city's problems with the crowded core by providing low-income housing on deserted Hart Island. All those old '60s do-gooder models were flawed. I mean, just handing away the candy store because of what? The guilt? TV ANNOUNCER: Little known and the Big Apple-- Rupert King's plan is more aggressive. Sorry. One second. Yeah? Uh, hi Steven. It's Matthews. The other side left the table. Yes, Steve. Short the stock into the ground. Orders from on high. Yep. [CHUCKLE] Say uncle. OK. Sorry about that. Where were we? Well, it's a simple plan-- baseline dignity. Give them hope, give them work, get them off the streets. Ah, it kills them to see them on the streets. Yes. You know, and the other jerk sitting in the corner didn't know what the hell was going on. Where are we going? Get to work, pinheads. CHANTING CHILDREN: Don't you laugh when the hearse goes by, for you will be the next to die. The worms crawl in. The worms crawl out. The worms play poker on your snout. The worms crawl in. The worms crawl out. Your eyes fall out. Your teeth decay. And that's the end of a beautiful day. Unit 3432, missing person base. DISPATCHER (ON CB): Copy 3432. What's your message? This unit en route to Hart Island on case 8928. DISPATCHER (ON CB): Missing person base acknowledged. Yeah, one sec. Hello? Hi. Yeah, hang on. Honey number one. Can he call you back? Great. Hello. Oh, hi. Yeah, yeah. Just a sec. Honey number two. Hi, honey. Yeah. No, I'm busy right now. It can't. Look, I'll call you later, OK? Yeah. You, too. Mm-hm. Ciao. We're all proud of you sir. Project's getting a lot of positive attention. Right. Let's hope it does some good. RODGER: Markets say it's doing wonders. Fucking stench in here is going to make me sick. Get a breath of fresh air, man. Use the opportunity to meet new people. What are you talking about? They're dead people, huh? I mean, I betcha there isn't anybody in this whole town's who's got a goddamn idea what we got in the back here, huh? Bring out your dead! Shut the fuck up, man. Show some respect. What are you talking about, respect? We're a goddamn funeral procession in a fucking dump truck, man. I'd like to go back to jail, sir. One more word out of you is going to put you in the back. Better enjoy it, man. Going to spend most of the next year inside. [MUSIC PLAYING] RODGER: He said he's going for the plaque idea. Your name on that island forever. RUPERT KING: Can you fathom forever, Rodger? RODGER: I'd like to think so, sir. RUPERT KING: I'm not talking about forever as in long-term investments. I'm talking forever as in eternity. Special price today, man, $0.50. Here, matey. Make it last. A Benjamin Franklin? Thanks, man. Hey, [INAUDIBLE] number. RUPERT KING: Give a man a fish. RODGER: Reminds me, sir, you have the mayor's fundraiser this evening. RUPERT KING: What are we in for? RODGER: 7.5. It's just a damn island. Who've we got? Everyone. The mayor's re-election tie-in is irresistible, not to mention the historic value of your magnanimous and generous act of-- All right, all right. I get the point. De-lint me. Yes, sir. Oh. What have we here? Oh, yes. A man of vision. Yes, sir. Shame he's a Democrat. Demublicans, Republicrats. They're all pink on the inside, Rodger. Follow me. [MUSIC - SHADES OF CULTURE, "PAYIN RENT II"] Hey, hey, watch this now. Standing strong like foundation making moves in combination and yo the one who stresses I suppress like sedation. It's the dread, knocking suckers out like Sudafed. Crush the opposition cause they got me seeing red. They getting me madder than Doc Danner when he's in his altered state. At rapid rates I circulate to make the fakes disintegrate. Retaliate with forces from the subterranean. In hostile situations I'm aiming at your cranium. So heads up, you might get cut when we erupt. And when they ask, you can tell them hard is how I struck. The demolition team is demolishing, so caution is recommended when you up against the awesome individual shining like jewels. Better pay your rents and dues, because we sharper than Shinobi Ninja tools, severing nerve endings up inside this hip-hop body. Do like we do for credit cards, destroy the carbon copy. Yo, we about to make this evident. We all up in this so you know we paid our rent. Yo, I'm about to make this evident. I'm all up in this so you know I paid my rent. Yo, we about to make this evident. We all up in this so you know we paid our rent. Listen, cut out your spine man like psycho CAT scan. Rap skills a man's hand, so expend your best friends. I see through you like stencils. I'm sharpening pencils for all the battles that we wage on instruments. With the vocal chords aided by the larynx, it's kind of muffled through the mic cause you fucking cuffed it. Your rights have gotten rotten before you got shot in, the dance your fans have all taken a switch dance. Perfected an opposite reaction, tractions needed to grip and do the class on your mic trip. So pay your taxes to the governor. And if you didn't pay your dues the crew's coming through and roughing you. Yo, we about to make this evident. We all up in this so you know we paid our rent.

ARNIE: Big doings today. I, um, I'm afraid you're going to have to leave your vehicle shoreside on account of all this razzmatazz. [SIGH] Get this. The Rup there has got this idea to build some kind of town on the island. Between you and me, I think he's looking for a medal or something. Guess it's something he hasn't already got. Well, time to get wet. [HORN] Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. It's about time, you know. Hey, I know my rights. I got the right to my dignity and some decent working conditions. You got rights to shit. Hey, hey! - Hey, how you doing? - Yeah, man. [INAUDIBLE] What's going on, man? Had a court date. Well, what happened? Oh, man they denied my complaint. Fix was in. Same old shit. Neely, this is Robbie J. Hey man. Uh-huh. TONY: And Neely likes to stab holes in his body to express himself. NEELY: Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. Ain't that like just stabbing yourself over and over again in the face? No, man. It's like my body is like a piece of art. [CHUCKLING] They're going to make you take all that all off when you get to Rikers, though. You know that, right? [CHUCKLING] Anyway. Ah, shit. Oh, here goes some art right here. Yeah, one of New York's finest. I don't usually get the undivided attentions, so I'll catch up with you [INAUDIBLE].. [INAUDIBLE] You don't get like sinus problems with shit like that? [CHURNING ENGINE] Long Island Sound. I'm a cop. No shit. You look familiar. Sure. I'm famous-- especially among cops. What's your name? My name? Don't matter. Not anymore. You and yours took care of that. Matos. You're good with names. Yeah, well they matter to me. You know, you're that con who's been spouting all of that bullshit about being set up. Mine's not the only claim. How do you know about it? Well, maybe you've been yelling the loudest. [HORN] [DOOR CLOSING] Starting to feel seasick. Feeling fucking windsick. This fucking weather is stupid. Fuck all of it. Notice how everything around here is like an island, you know? You know, we got Rikers, yeah. Got Manhattan, huh? You got Queens. You got Brooklyn. You got Staten Island, you know? You got City Island. And then we've got this fucking island. It's freaky man, you know. I mean, it's like there ain't nothing connected to the mainland anymore. You know, it's like that there's-- there's nothing-- nothing connected to nothing. I'm going to blow, man. RODGER: There it is, Mr. King. Hart Island. All that land going to waste. Thank you, Rodger. Hop in. I'll give you a ride. [DOOR SLAM] Kind of beautiful, huh? Kind of. People lived here? ERNIE: Oh, yeah. People with yellow fever. All kinds of contagious diseases. Then they put in a lunatic asylum, and it was drug addicts and juvenile delinquents. Anyone they didn't want around they brought here. Cons called it Empty Town. Will you take a look at this, Rodger, huh? [CHUCKLING] The future site of Hope City. My grandmother's buried in one of these pauper graves. I'm sorry, sir. Where? Oh, somewhere back home. I don't know, really. Anyway, big change is coming here, Mackloe-- big changes. Great changes, sir. [DOORS CLOSING] Mm. Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm! Look at you. The captain's importing us the new and improved tight booty. Thanks, but you're not my type. Ooh. [CHUCKLING] See, if you move this over here, you can just about squeeze in another 300 units. I'm a little worried about the soil reports on this side, sir. Well, what do we have here? Turned earth? Don't worry about that. [PATTING] You know, the hardest thing for a man to move? Public opinion. [CHUCKING] That's a good one! No. Earth. Plain old dirt. We've got to dig into the soil, rip it, tear it move it-- hundreds of thousands of tons of it. It's like a war, Rodger. You're not squeamish, are you? Not at all, sir. Good. Stake those points in Potter's Field for samples. Better get down to the ceremony. Can't keep the man waiting. How do I look? You look fine, sir. Yeah, well, give me a little hug. Yeah. Oh, not too much. Don't want to mess the suit. That's for your eyes only. I don't care if you have to eat the hard drive. That's only for you. [APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS] [INAUDIBLE] outside. I'm here for the ID. Sergeant O'Keefe? Sorry. Dwight Truman. Captain. Little bit of home. Hope you're not offended. Nah, beats the pictures I have to look at all day. At least these women are in one piece. So you'll be joining us at the pit? Yes. I have the papers for the ID right here. OK. [CHUCKLING] RUPERT KING: That's always a-- yes. MAYOR: That's a good one. RUPERT KING: It is a good one. [CHUCKLING] Mr. Mayor. Are you aware that Mr. King is under investigation by the European Health Commission? That story is unfounded. I-- No, it's true. My health has never been better. [CHUCKLING] So, Mr. King, could you tell us your views on the use of prison inmates in certain countries for AIDS research? It's a nice day, dear friend. I suggest you enjoy it. Excuse me. Asshole. Put your stakes over here. MELISSA: All those souls. DWIGHT: Almost a million of them. Got a whole city out there. This might be your girl. Unknown buried in pit 40. Date's about right. I'll get a crew on it in a couple hours. Hours? DWIGHT: Sorry, best I can do. Make yourself comfortable. I'll go check out the site. Chew? No, thanks. Hey, Chief. Missed the morning ride with you. Hey, Tony. Wanted to trade some more fish tales? We'll do [INAUDIBLE] when I get out. Uh-huh. Pulled one out last summer the size of a car. Oh, yeah? Two-door, four-door, or minivan? [CHUCKLING] Limo. All right. Get your gear and show Neely the ropes. That's to see if he's a good guy. And so I can think of only one reason why this great man would be out here today, and that reason is hope. Hope City is the humane solution to many of our city's problems. We'll get them off the streets, clean them up, put them to work. Put to work doing what? Listen, friend. I'm just giving society's least fortunate a chance to make a contribution. That's the best leg up they'll ever get. It is a gift of hope. And Rupert King is making it from his heart. [SQUISHING] [GRUNTING] [TAPPING] [BUZZ] [GROAN] Not many people know this about me, Melanie, but I myself come from a hopeless background, one of poverty and uncertainty. But I got lucky. I made a name for myself, and made a little bit of money along the way. So now I think it's time to just give a little back. Any questions? Yes, Mr. King. Would you be willing to disclose your stock holdings in the pharmaceutical sector? I'm going to bury that asshole. Heads up. We've got another customer coming in. So what are we doing here? We're just putting him in here, and that's it. TONY: Yeah, real special, aye? [THUMP] Oh, man. Oh, fuck. OK, that's enough for me. Oh, Neely, don't worry about it. Just grab the other side. Ah, man. Come on, guys, put it back together. Goddamn cheap coffins. They do everything half-assed these days. TONY: Got it, chief. We've got some little ones here. [INAUDIBLE] Sergeant, we're ready to head over to your girl. Tony, Davidson. Pit 40. What's that for? Figure someone should say something, no? So on behalf of our needy, our homeless, and in thanks for your generous efforts, Rupert, I hereby give you the deed to Hope City, New York. Thank you. Thank you very much.

What do you do when you get the boogers? What are you talking about, man? I take out the ring, and I pick them out, just like anybody else does. What about when they get cold? You probably get fucked-- you get fucked up headaches and shit. Like that with that? Tony! Why are you hollering, yo? Why-- just why don't you just calm the fuck down? NEELY: Tony!

You watch yourself. What? Oh, hey, you're a cop? I owe you respect? I don't have time for your bullshit. You want bullshit. You were in the 39th. That either makes you ignorant or a liar. You are a convicted criminal. Yeah, sure, I got a JV file a mile long. But I've been clean for years. And then one day I'm walking down the wrong side of street, and I get busted, and it's back to square fucking one! This is not the time. No? When? huh? They denied my complaint. Huh? They had me in handcuffs for the fucking line-up. Take it up with the judge. You know, I'm surprised that you're still sticking up for your buddy cops after they busted your ass down to missing persons. Mackloe! - [SHOUTS] - Jeez! Fuck! [LAUGHING] All right. That's good shit, man. Your fucking face was like-- Great fucking joke, mate. Listen. I gotta find my guy, so split up again and quit yanking my chain, OK? No. I ain't going nowhere.

I'm going to look for Robbie J. I don't think that's a good idea. The boys are my responsibility. The ferry should have been here by now. Boss? I don't feel so hot. I gotta get to Rikers. (DRUNKENLY) Eh, "Lancelot Link," "The Hathaways," and "Mr. Smith." Lancelot Link-- "The Hathaways" and "Mr. Smith." Oh, I got it. OK. Sitcoms with a mother-in-law. [LAUGHING] Mother-in-laws?

Somebody should find out what that guy has got. Mr. King, I'm sorry. I am so sorry that I took your watch. I really didn't mean it, sir. All right. Just get a grip. So Robbie J's got it, and I'm sure that he's fine with giving it back. I'm sure that it wouldn't be a problem. Hey can you turn them on? [SEETHING MAGGOTS] [HEAVY BREATHS] [RAPIDLY RECEDING FOOTSTEPS] [DOOR OPENING] OK. Somebody tell me how a body can decompose in two hours. I mean, he was just a kid. Bobbie J. [CLATTER] OK, Captain.

MELISSA: Here it is. [SMACK] [BUZZING] [CLATTERING] [SMACK] Hm. Bravo. This is personal. They're after us. I don't think it's personal. They're just out there. No, no. They're hunting us. (LAUGHING) Oh, yeah. There's always been sadness in those fields. Mystical bullshit. Look, tomorrow morning I'll have this place doused in malathion. Problem solved. [STUMBLING] Sorry. I'm just feeling a bit dizzy. I got bit out there. Just hang in there, OK? Jesus. [INAUDIBLE] the fishermen do when you get out of here, huh? You do realize that he's carrying an infectious disease? What the fuck do you know? Are you a doctor now? Come on, look at the facts! The first one to go down was his jailbird friend. Shut up. There's nothing you can do for him. Look. I don't want to sound cruel, but I say we put him out. Anybody leaves, it's you. Steady, matey. [THUMP] [LOUD BUZZING] [STEADY THUMPS] OK. They're hunting us. But why? I don't know. [KEYBOARD CLICKS] Look at this. [RATTLING ON KEYBOARD] Containment? Custody center? The poor never been so safe. Could be Rikers, except for the lawn ornaments. MELISSA: Human test subjects? [SLAM] What the fuck are you doing? That's private. Homeless and stupid. Not going to go for it. You'd be amazed at what the desperate will do for money. So we get them off the streets. Well, that's what I promised. For good. Come on, now. You exaggerate. Anyway, tell me honestly, Sergeant, would you really miss them? You son-of-a-bitch. [STUMBLING] I've got it. I've got the fever. I'm next. Do you know why-- do you know why they call these places Potter's Field? There was this place in Jerusalem. And nothing grew. Potters dug their clay there. Judas betrayed Jesus for 30 pieces of silver. After Jesus was crucified, they took that blood money, and they bought Potter's Field so that strangers and the poor could be buried. Tony? [GASPING] I'm going to end up buried-- buried here. Let's get him out of here. One more word out of you know, and I'll shoot you. [CLATTER] [GASPING] [GURGLING] [LIQUIDY SOUNDS] Maybe somebody will listen to me next time. Come on, Tony. In the office. Come on. [SEETHING MAGGOTS] [ROAR OF BUZZING] It's strange. It's like they're waiting for something. They're not moving. I think we can make a break for it. RUPERT KING: Oh, like I say, we torch the vermin and obliterate them. TONY: We've got to bury the chief. As soon as this is all over. Now. What? Bury him now. Potter's Field. Great. I'll take care of the flower arrangements. Tony, don't do this. She's the only cop around here that ever cared. Give me your coat. Give me your fucking coat. [DOOR CLOSING] It's a terrible shame. Shut up. He's a goner. Shut the fuck up. Of course, if you ask me, it's now or never. So why don't you and I make a run for it? Feel free to try. I might just do that. [CHUCKLING] Now look, we have to get our stories straight, first. The story is simple. Nature just kicked her ass. Oh, kicked our ass. Right. Yeah, not exactly the tag line I had in mind for Hope City. "Nature just kicked our ass." Do you ever give up? Never. Do you? Listen. Here's the proposal. You help me keep the lid on things here, and I'm going to bring you into Hope City. I'm not interested. Eh. It's going to be more money than you've ever dreamed. What the fuck do you know about my dreams? All right. All right. I bring in the jailbird, too-- if he gets back. With his record, that's the best offer he's going to get. No deal. [DOOR CLOSING] [GROANING] Doesn't anyone believe in teamwork anymore? [SPADE BREAKING GROUND] [GROANING] [CLICKING OF LIGHTER] [GURGLING] Sweet dreams you little bastard. Cry not for him, for he is with the ether. No longer does he cast a shadow upon the earth as we do. Let's try the boat by the shore. OK. Let's get King. [CRAZY LAUGHTER] You sons of bitches! [LAUGHING] [EXPLOSION] [ROAR OF BUZZING] OK. Into the truck. Yay, ha-ha, I've got the bastards! Go on! Get in! Get in! [DOORS SLAMMING] Ah, well, reunited at last. [ENGINE TURNING OVER] Go to hell, King. Make no mistake, friend, we're there as we speak. [ENGINE TURNING OVER] Shit! Damn thing won't start. Where are they? [CHUCKLING] It's a route. Quiet. [INAUDIBLE] They're just sitting out there. I'm getting out of here. Head for the shore. Come on! Come on! Drop the gun now! Wait a minute, Sergeant. Otherwise, your jailbird friend here gets the chop. Don't be crazy, King. We've got to get out of here. Oh, no. Nobody leaves this island till we've sat down and thrashed out a deal. TONY: What's wrong with you? Why don't you forget about this place? Listen, friend. You know, I don't even know your name. But anyway, it doesn't matter. Do you know what makes a great man? Hey, hey! Stop it! Don't, Sergeant. Don't do it. Let me tell you what makes a great man-- determination, guts, commitment, work, destiny. Oh, and luck. Yeah. Plain old luck. A great man has to have luck. A great man doesn't have six deals in a row go sour on him. Hope City's my last card. I can't let it go. Please. Help me breathe life into Hope City. I can't. I'm really truly sorry to hear that, Sergeant. [COCKING GUN] King, don't! [ROAR OF BUZZING] [GUNSHOTS] [SCREAM] Be careful, Tony. [GASPING] [WALKING WITH HEAVY TREAD] [CRACKLE] [GASP] [THUD] [SEETHING MAGGOTS] [BUZZING] [GASPING] - Come on, Tony. [GRUNTING AND GASPING] [ROAR OF BUZZING] [BUZZING RECEDING] They wanted King. They got him. Come on, let's get to that boat. [TRAFFIC] [MUSIC PLAYING] [TRAFFIC] Thanks for reopening my case. You bet. Come on. Let's get you out of here. I was found in the streets of New York City. I was lucky. Others aren't so lucky, but I look for them anyway. You see, names matter to me. [MUSIC - SHADES OF CULTURE, "PAYIN RENT II"] Entering your station, the lyrical devastation. Whack MC annihilation and termination. Hey, hey. Watch this now. Standing strong like foundation, making moves in combination. And yo the one who stresses I suppresses like sedation. It's the dread, knocking suckers out like Sudafed. Crush the opposition cause they got me seeing red. They getting me madder than Doc Banner when he's in his altered state. At rapid rates I circulate to make the fakes disintegrate. Retaliate with reports from the subterranean. In hostile situations I'm aiming at your cranium. So heads up, you might get cut when we erupt. And when they ask, you can tell them hard was how I struck. The demolition team is demolishing, so caution is recommended when you up against the awesome. Individual shining like jewels. Better pay your rent and dues, cause we sharper than Shinobi Ninja tools. Severing nerve endings up inside this hip-hop body. Do like we do for credit cards, destroy the carbon copy. Yo, we about to make this evident. We all up in this, so you know we paid our rent. Yo, I'm about to make this evident. I'm all up in this so you know I paid my rent. Yo, we about to make this evident. We all up in this, so you know we paid our rent. Yo, we about to make this evident. We all up in this so you know we paid our rent. Why. You try and find the right lie, but you're wasting everybody's time while you're posing. I'm cool and slow with plenty of precision. Immaculate dark vocal box. I live on the perimeter on the South Shore, Mount Rushmore. I'm mad like Zulu language, but you understand me perfectly. It's Kandu, supreme fucking Khan. I'm all eight grades, my following-- each one, teach one. My name is on their brain and my name reigns. Ring the alarm, another fucking sound done dead. Romance and finance, the legend. You go on the job, run the fucking errands, playa-haters, snake fakes and devils tonight. You will be no more. Yesterday it was the eve of destruction. Who next in line for the crushin'? Yo, we about to make shit evident. We all up in this and you know we paid our rent. Yo, we're about to make it evident. We all up in this, and you know we paid our rent. Yo, we're about to make it evident. We all up in this and you know we paid our rent. Yo, Scales Empire and Shades of Culture, you know, it don't pay the rent. A shaved head like Telly Savalas on your tele-vision, and everything nice I rhyme proficient. Check this style, I compile herbs and verbs with no words from competition. Sit back and listen. Cut out your spine man like psycho CAT scan. Rap skills a man's hands, so expend your best friends. I see through you like stencils. I'm sharpening pencils for all the battles that we wage upon instrumentals. With the vocal chords aided by the larynx, it's kind of muffled to the mic cause you fucking cuffed it. Your rhymes have gotten rotten. Before you got shot in the dance, your fans have all taken a switch dance. Perfected an opposite reaction, traction's needed to grip, and to the class on your mic clip. So pay your taxes to the governor. And if you didn't pay your dues the crew's coming through and roughing you. Yo, we about to make this evident. We all up in this so you know we paid our rent. Yo, we about to make this evident. We all up in this so you know we paid our rent. Yo, we about to make this evident. We all up in this so you know we paid our rent. Yo. We about to make this evident. We all up in here so you know we paid our rent. Ah yeah.
