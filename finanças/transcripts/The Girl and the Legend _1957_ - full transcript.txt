On the island, there was a small river. Robinson had hidden his boat? Yes, under the bushes and the branches. He had built his boat himself? Of course. There was nobody else. He built everything himself. His cabin as well? His cabin as well. And his tools, and all the things... that he needed to live. The cabin is still there? It's all still there. A boat took him away from there. He spent 28 years on the island. There was nobody else? Nobody, since Robinson has left. THE GIRL AND THE LEGEND I would have stayed on the island. I would never have left. You said... that it was hot all year round on the island. It must be good to be always hot. You think so! It was so hot... Robinson had to make an umbrella. Otherwise, he'd never have stood it. I don't mind the heat. For me, it never gets too hot. I'm telling you: when I grow up, I'm going to the island. How will you do it? I will sign on as a cabin boy. When we near the island, I'll run away. They'll never hire a weakling like you. I'm stronger than you think. You cannot unload the two ships that are docked. The warehouses are full! They work too slowly. There aren't enough hands. The children are doing their best, but they are only children. They are sturdy! - Not enough, Mr. Gillis. For carding, it's passable, but for weaving, it's pathetic. Speed up! Go on! Well, you're working hard today? Yes, Mr. Miles. Good. They are too puny. We can't ease up. Out of the question! English cotton is famous, we must stay at the forefront. It is the XVIIIth century! What should we do with him? Let's go, Jim. I want to get away. Wait. Maud ! What is it? What is it? - It's Ben. Again? If he doesn't work, he'll be dismissed. His parents need his pay. Come. Ben, come. I'll take him up there. Tell Mr. Miles that I needed him to help me. The cotton is so heavy that I can't get it out. Lie down. There, nobody can see you. It's nice here. When the King of England crosses Hyde Park Can you tell me how many horses pull his carriage? Two whites, two blacks and a piebald The King's carriage flies like the wind! When we sing loudly, we're no longer afraid of the dark. It's true. - You see? He can't be far away, Majesty. The park gates are all guarded. If anything bad happens to my son, you'll be answerable, Lord Horace. Majesty, I don't understand... why Prince George left his room. His Highness is a most reasonable child. Enter! Majesty, we have found His Highness. Where is my son? He will appear before Your Majesty shortly. Immediately! But His Highness is in such a state... Yes, Majesty. Quick, Highness, His Majesty is waiting. Give me that, I'll do it. Allow me, Highness, the left ear... the right... What a state you're in! Good Lord, your culottes are soaked through! Where were you, Prince George? In the park, Majesty. In the park? In pitch black and in the rain? Yes, Majesty. What were you doing down there? I was sleeping. You were sleeping? I wanted to know if you can sleep outside in the rain. Do you often seek out this sort of experience, Prince George? - Yes, Majesty. I found out that we can cook fish on stones. I know nothing about this, Majesty. I have said nothing about fish. What are you doing there, Mr. Pum ? There was a drop of water, Majesty. It was about to run down the neck of His Highness. Who has been putting these ideas in your head, Prince George? I read a book, Majesty. I wanted to know if it told the truth. What book? Robinson Crusoe. Highness, you know very well... that His Majesty has banned that book. You liked that book so much... that you wanted to try to live like that Robinson? Yes, Majesty. I don't understand. Your bed is not comfortable enough? The Palace cuisine doesn't suit you? Yes, Majesty, but... Do we not do everything for you here? Precisely, Majesty. Pardon? You do everything for me. Robinson was entirely alone. It's exciting to do things for yourself. One day, you will rule over one of the most powerful countries in the world. As king of this country, you will have other duties... than cooking fish and sleeping under the stars. Yes, Majesty. Please concern yourself a little more with your homework. Conduct the prince to his room, Mr. Pum, where he will be less cold. Please, Highness... Majesty, I have informed Prince George of the deplorable role... played by the author of Robinson against Your Majesty. That he has been in prison... for attacking in his writings the government of Your Majesty. And how did my son reply? Reply. He responded: "This man must have great courage to contradict my father." That goes a long way... I explained to the prince... why Your Majesty had to prohibit Robinson. This book perverts youth. Sailors have been encouraged to leave their ships... to live on a desert island like this Robinson. Like this Robinson. A wave lifted me over thirty feet. But I sensed that it had carried me on to solid ground. A short distance away, I saw the palm trees on the shore that swayed in the storm. Twice I felt the soil under my feet and two times I was carried back out to sea. The last wave almost led to my loss. Indeed, a new wave grabbed me... and threw me so violently against a reef... that I lost consciousness. If the waves had come back to reclaim me at that moment, I would have been... permanently lost. Fortunately, I was able to regain consciousness before that happened. I was saved. Mr. Defoe! - Yes, yes. Thus began, my friends, my first day... on that island. And you stayed there for 28 years? Yes, my child. All alone... for 28 years. Dinner is ready, Mr. Defoe. You must return home. You climbed the hill at once or you waited? Go on, that's enough! Come, Mr. Defoe. It's always the same. Your hands are hot. That is failing you. Let me tell my stories. The children are the only ones who want to hear. They believe that you are Robinson and that you have lived these adventures. I have lived them. I have lived them! You said the other day, to mother and me, that you had never been on that island. An old sailor told you the story. Yes, he told me... but it was I who wrote it. And you know, now I'm older, I have convinced myself that I lived these adventures. At least... you still know a nice old man... who has not been caught lying. Devil! I should be ashamed. They were still there? Yes, Mrs. Cantley. They were all still there. It was lucky we freed you that Sunday... when they would have finished by killing you with all their questions! Tell me, Maud... The little palid one, does he also work with you? Ben? Of course, he also works for Mr. Gillis. We are living in a great age! It's getting better and better... when even children must work. What else should they do? Learn to read and write. Youngsters the age of Ben should just be having fun. But Mr. Defoe... if they don't work, how are we going to live? She's right, Mr. Defoe. Your father will pay? - If he wants, he can pay. Good. What is it? Ah, it's you. What do you want? I want to see my father. - Mr. Tom! It makes him ill to see you. It's very important. - Who are you? We are taking him to prison. My name is Greene. What happened? I'm sorry, Mr. Defoe. The patron of the Yellow Parrot asked us to arrest your son. Your son owes him 50 pounds. 50 pounds! Come to my room. We will wait here. You are going to prison... Only if you don't pay. It's why I've come here. For that... my son is going to prison... This is the final straw! What can I do if the landlord wants to make a scandal? 50 pounds, it's not the end of the world! It is more than I have, Tom. Things have changed since your visit. But then, you haven't been to see me for six months. Look, this is all I have. Two coats, a few shirts. You want them? Take them. I haven't anything else! These... my papers. The manuscripts. The manuscript of Robinson ...which is banned. Father, help me one more time. The last time. How many times have I heard that! Please! No. Very well. The son of the great Daniel Defoe is going to prison. The son of a man who was once adviser to the King. That should amuse them, at Court. I cannot help you. I wouldn't, even if I could. I gave you everything. I sold my house... to pay your debts, my carriage, my books, everything! I don't know how I'm going to pay this poor woman... who has taken me into her home. You did it all for me? If that was the case, I wouldn't be here in front of you. What are you saying? Why have you not sought reconciliation with the King? It's impossible. I cannot. And why? I'll tell you... you always want to be right. The brillant Daniel Defoe... knows better than all the world what is right! Others must believe, shut up and prostrate themselves before you. Whether it's the King, or my mother... or me. You think only of yourself. We can go, Mr. Greene. - Tom! Excuse us for bothering you. I know that your son has taken us for a ride. Mr. Brumble, take him. Take a good look at the celebrated Daniel Defoe! He does nothing to help his son. My fate is irrelevant to him! He thinks only of what's right. Who's fault is it that our lives are in misery? We could all be living in a palace. Instead, he prefers that we live in a hovel! Let me go, I'm coming. Why won't you help him? What is wrong with you? Mind your own business. But Mr. Defoe... The dinner... How can he let his son go to prison? A man like Tom can end up in prison. It's there that is his place. I don't believe it. - What? He is not so bad. What do you know? Because he's a handsome boy and speaks to you nicely... No, it's not that. I assure you! Each time Mr. Tom visits, his father gets angry with him. He is always angry. He has every reason to be. It cannot always be him who's to blame. It went well in. It's a hard wood. You imagine if it had hit an aardvark! The point is blunted. - It needs sharpening every time. Robinson sharpened his arrows. For six months, he ate nothing but aardvarks. Only that? - And they aren't very big. But nice grilled, mmm! I searched for hours in the undergrowth of the park. For an incredible time? For an incredible time. Exhausted and bedraggled, my aides were trailing behind. Exhausted and bedraggled... Fortunately, I could keep going. Suddenly, in a flash of lightning, I saw him. His Highness? Yes, His Highness. I took him in my arms... - The little prince so delicate... I brought him to His Majesty. And Her Majesty? His Majesty had tears in his eyes. He said to me: "My friend, my dear Pum..." My very dear Herodes Pum! "I will be forever..." His Majesty really said: "My very dear Herodes Pum"? Yes. "My very dear Herodes..." - Pum. "I will be forever grateful. "Prince George, shake the hand of your saviour." And the prince? The prince wanted to press my hand to his lips, but... But? - I stopped him. I made a bow... You kneel before me as before the prince. Mr. Pum, what is it? - I am hurt! There are murderers in Hyde Park! I can't stand the sight of blood. I feel faint... Ms. Hackett, get a hold of yourself. You want something? Yes, but I wasn't aiming for you. It's my fault. I told him: "Fire." - And at what? At an aardvark. - At an aardvark! We were playing at Robinson. Robinson! You hear that? Murderers! Criminals ! You'll see! I'm not going to let them get away with this. You must punish them severely, Mr. Drinkwater. Please, Mr. Pum... - Look at that! Mr. Pum can hardly sit. Let me look at your wound, to see it isn't infected. Later. You must give an exemplary punishment. It's thanks to me that you are the King's chimney-sweep. Mr. Pum, he did not mean to. 25 strokes, in front of me. With each stroke, he'll say: "I will never read another book." I never have read a book. - Me neither. Reading, it's unhealthy. For the love of God, be careful. The children read, and that, is the root of evil. The children read Robinson, a book forbidden by the King. Tomorrow, I will propose a decree... banning reading to children. Good, Mr. Pum. No doubt His Majesty will listen. Of course! His Majesty always calls Mr. Pum "his very dear friend". Good... M. Drinkwater, do your duty. I want to hear the sentence. Understand? Come on. But it's not his fault. Lash me. I will never read a book. Stronger! Speak up! I will never read a book. That's enough. Calm down, he's not hitting that hard. Why is he hitting him? - Pum is his superior. He would have had him sacked. I'm sick of it. What do you want to do? We can do nothing. Yes! I know exactly what we can do. You'll recognise him? Yes. I was there when he took Philip Stanton on board. There! What is it? You are Captain Black? - Yes. You took my friend Philip Stanton on board. Not so loud, not so loud. You are asking after him? - No, it's not that. He is fine. He's at sea. That's all that you wanted? - No. We want to embark! - Ah, you want to embark. Your parents know about this? - No. You want to sneak off? Yes, like Philip Stanton. Philip was older than you. And he is an orphan. We wouldn't tell anyone. We wouldn't mention your name. Maybe we can work something out. Next Sunday, at quarter to midnight, I'm setting sail. If the harbour police catch you, you never saw me. Yes, thank you. But you, the runt, I cannot take. Why? - Shush! Shut up! We go together. - Or we all stay here. I look weak, but I'm strong! I will do whatever you want. Ah, you can do anything? Okay I'll take you, Hercules. - Thank you! Very well, the 15th. Wait for me under the bridge. It'd be useless to come before midnight, understand? Thank you! Good night. One day, you'll be busted. And we'll be in trouble. You know many who volunteer to embark? Two of the three are already strong, there's that too. Come play the dice! Bread for the prisoners! Come play the dice! Bread for the prisoners! A bottle of cognac, perhaps? Mr. Defoe... What is it? We are drinking tea. Will you join us? No, thank you. Windows do bad things to prisoners. Don't look outside. Look instead at yourself. The introspection. The great ideas of mankind. I will lend you wonderful books. I don't want any books. When you've spent as much time here as me, you won't be saying that. Books have comforted me in many things... including those of your father. Don't speak to me of his books. Mr. Defoe. believe me, many people... pay a fortune for his books, especially those that have been prohibited. Hello, Mr. Greene. - Hello. We are taking food to my husband. - Yes, yes, go ahead. Hello. I would like to Mr. Tom Defoe. Defoe? What do you want to see him for? Only to know that he is well. It is forbidden? No. He is in the courtyard. Follow me. Mr. Defoe, you have a visitor. Hello, Mr. Tom. It's you. - Yes. My father sent you? No. He doesn't know I'm here. What do you want? He is ill. It's your fault that he's ill. Ah, that too, is my fault. It's always my fault. And my father is goodness itself. He has time for the whole world... except his own son. What's the use? Anyway, it would have done no good. If it's like that, I'm leaving. - Forgive me. It breaks his heart knowing you are here. Then, he should help me! - He cannot. He could... but he doesn't want to. - It's false! Very well, it's false. I'm not going to argue it with you. What do you want? If he knew that you were sorry and that you will reform, it would be the best medicine. Write to him. Can I say something? Yes. Tell him this, if you like... I would be grateful to him if he left me here. I am in excellent company. With this gentleman, I'm learning how to play cards. He's showing me how to win... with little tricks that will be most useful. And they... when I'm feeling lonely, they comfort me. They've taken a liking to me, because I'm a pretty boy. Mme Penthouse's esteemed enterprise had been declared bankrupt. And down here... my father always wanted me to learn. Mr. Wilde is a philosopher. After six years in here, perhaps I will be too. Mr. Tom... If the time in here is too long, I have just to say the word... and these men will pay my debt. I could be free tomorrow. They are recruiting sailors. Mr. Defoe. Sailors are dying, going crazy and jumping into the water. Mr. Defoe. - You called? No! Pity. Pity, we thought that you had decided. Miss, the Royal Navy... has won glory in all the oceans of the world. This young man has no reason to denigrate the service. The admiral Sir Francis Drake himself, started as a cabin boy in the navy. Tell all this to my father. He'll enjoy it, he loves the sea. Don't talk like that. He is very sick. It will perhaps make him better if he knows it all. I have always defended you, against everyone. I always said that you were not so bad. I don't know what to think. I don't care what you think. It beats me why a girl like you is bothering with such a rascal. In the end, it's not my business. At least, he ate his soup. But apart from that... What? He doesn't speak of him. All day. In his sleep, he talks of him. He is wonderful with all the children of London. But with his own son... And if I was going to talk to him? No, I believe it would serve no purpose. Yes, you're right. He won't change. It's tragic. Mama... if Mr. Defoe had not contradicted the King, Mr. Tom today would be in the Court. Indeed. Why? I wanted to say... that his life could have been so different. Tell me, Maud, you're not...? What? Nothing, nothing. Sleep well, my child. Good night. I've hidden my stuff in the yard. I'm not coming back. I would like to take Maud. You've seen women on these ships? She could do the cooking. I'd prefer that she was there. If you don't hold your tongue, I'll give you a thrashing. I was just saying. It's bad that we're leaving her. Wait... you haven't told her anything? No. Yes. At least... I only asked her... What? If she would like to go on a journey. To Maud ! She isn't stupid, she'll understand what you meant. Who's she speaking to? We met at the prison. Yes, what is it? I have a message from Mr. Defoe. He would like to talk to you. To me? You must come quickly. Understood. Thank you. Go with her as usual, as far as her door. Don't leave her for an instant. - Okay. Act like normal, she mustn't notice anything. And if you squeal... - No, I'll say nothing. It won't be worth your while to come along at midnight. This is all you've done? What's the matter with you? It's always necessary to get angry with you. This is less than usual. Insolent, with it! I've had enough. I'm deducting you today. I will pay you for five days. And you will stay here to tidy up. I'll bring you to heel. Finished for today! What should we do? Go with Maud, we'll do the cleaning up. - What is it? Nothing, why? They are saying you're plotting something. - Not at all! Come on, Maud, we'll go home. Ben, you can't come home with me tonight. Why? Where are you going? I have to go see someone at the prison. I'll come with you. - You don't want to go home? No, this evening I have the time. And you well know that I don't like to go home alone. Okay, come on. Bring that bucket of red dye. Good idea! Saturday, he'll dock it from my pay. Quite right, Mr. Jim. We can't relax. We must remain at the forefront. English cotton is world famous. Hey, Jackie... - What, Jackie? Let her out. So, Jackie... go, save yourself. Go a long way away and never come back. Little one, what are you doing here? He's accompanying me, Mr. Greene. Go sit down. I thank you. - For what? For coming here one more time. You called me. What is it? Maud... when you came, I was very unpleasant. Yes, yes. You had done nothing. You have always been so kind. Yes... And I wanted to say... that I'm sorry. Sincerely. That's all? That's all. Are you disappointed? No. No, I'm delighted. It's me who knows you best. I always said you aren't bad. To your father as well. Did he throw you out? - Not at all. Mr. Tom, it is not always like you think. Since you've been here, he's been sick in his room. He talks to you as if you are there. We can hear it all through the door. He is heart-broken. You could try... ask his forgiveness... No, Maud, never. It would serve no purpose. To make me happy. I am in prison. I couldn't get out, even if I wanted to. Mr. Greene. Yes? Would you free Mr. Tom, for just one hour? Prisoners may be absent... if someone acts as their guarantor. - Take me. I will stand as guarantor. What is it? - Nothing. That doesn't make sense. Return. - It doesn't bother me. The guarantor must be at least 18 years old. Are you 18 years old? - Yes, for a long time. Think about this carefully.... if he doesn't return, you must stay here and pay his debt. Don't do that. Mr. Tom, you must go. And if I don't come back? I know you will come back. - Are you so sure? Yes. Tell my mother where I am. I'll go... since you insist. - Thank you. Wait, wait. You must sign. You too... that you stay voluntarily in his place. You can go. Mr. Tom! I was right. I'll be quick. How 's that, you were right? I have always said that he's not bad. Go back, Ben. - No, why? I must not leave you alone. You must not? - I meant to say... I don't want to leave you alone in this prison... under any circumstances. You want to stay here? - Yes, if it's possible. Good. Come. I have to lock you up. It's a funny prison. It's a leaving party. Those girls are freed tomorrow. Please enter. Come, sit down. Tell me, Maud... - Yes? You must stay here until he comes back? And if he doesn't come back? - He'll be back. I had to do it. When I think of the joy of his father when he sees him, I could stay here all night. All night? What is it? Nothing, nothing. Only, I hope he comes back in an hour, that's all. What's that? He locked us in! Yes, he has to. Why? We've done nothing. You would have done better to go home. Why? It's interesting. Truly very interesting. It's nice you stayed with me. Don't worry, he'll be back. Sure? - Sure. He's an honest man. Then why is he in prison? That can happen to anyone. I came because... Maud told me that all was not well with you. It is already better. Come in. I'm glad you're here. Sit down. You have paid your debts? They have freed you? I'm free for an hour. An hour? Don't worry. You are angry? No. How can one be angry at someone... when one feels pity for them? When I'm free, things will be different, I'll work. I'm promising you! You know, I have already seen many misfortunes. I know... that you never trusted me. Otherwise I'd have been more disappointed. These are only words. If I believed you, what difference would it make? I cannot pay your debts. Yes. Yes, Papa. you can. Here. Your manuscript for Robinson. Many people in London would own it. A man would pay 100 pounds to put it in his window. You want to sell my Robinson? My Robinson? It's for this, all your fine promises, because you haven't changed. Not at all. There are some things we cannot do. The book was prohibited. All copies were seized. This is the only one that remains. He talks to me... and he wants that I get rid of it? And me? I don't count for you? These papers are more important than your own son! You do not understand me! I understand very well. It does me good that I'm in prison? Yes, Tom, it's good for you. There! - What? The sound of oars. No, it's the lapping of waves. Here's Jackie. He found us. Get him. Come on, let's take him with us. What's happened to Ben? He's surely cooking up something. And if he doesn't show? - We leave without him. What's this noise? Who's so keen to get in? Place! - You are well... Sorry, I didn't know it was you, Mr. Heep. I want to see Mr. Greene. He's in his office. I'll show you the way. Mr. Greene! Mr. Heep is there. Good evening, Mr. Heep. You can release him. He has paid his debt. Go bring the children. He has paid? He has paid. He brought me the money. The IOU, I have to enter it in the ledger... then it is all settled. Where did the money come from? That's my affair. I can leave? One moment! I must check... that all is in order. Mr. Heep, I'll be quick. Mr. Tom... I've heard. Your father has helped you? Yes, my father has helped me. That's good. You thought that he wouldn't help you. It was silly on my part. It's still not finished? - A moment. You'll come back with me? No, I have something to do. I must go with Mr. Heep. It's good you are free. Let's go. But Mr. Tom... Excuse me. Thank you. Good night, Mr. Heep. So, are you coming? Who was that? Mr. Heep, of The Yellow Parrot... the biggest swindler in London. I'm telling you for the last time, leave be Mr. Tom. When you knock about with the landlord of The Yellow Parrot, you are lost. Ben, that was the doctor. He was at our's. Come. - That's all we need right now. My son is a scoundrel, Mrs Cantley. My son has robbed me. He has robbed me! He came here to steal from me. No, it's not true. I opened the door, I talked with him. He was full of good intentions. He robbed me! He robbed me. Where have you been? His son has been here to rob him. That wretch has stolen from his own father. Give it to me, Tom, give me my Robinson . What, Robinson ? He took the manuscript of Robinson. He stole it? Where are you, Tom? Where are you? He takes everything so much to heart. This will finish him off. He told me that his father had helped him. And it's for this we've been in jail! What was the name of that man who Tom left with? Under the old gallows Three inches below the cursed earth You'll find the treasure of human death If we find it The gallows, the cursed earth we'll find the treasure the treasure of human death If we find it The treasure of human death, Find it The treasure of human death, try it Under the old gallows Three inches below the cursed earth Silence! They are cheerful... very cheerful. Benson paid for the round. I told you not to come back here until you had paid your debt. I am paying, Mr. Heep. The merchandise is back there. You want to take a peek? - Burglary? Robbing. - Piccadilly? Hyde Park. - Of the walkers? A carriage. Anyone see you? Two men of Hawkins. We were too quick for them. Dammit! Again this gang of Hawkins! They were livid. Hyde Park is their territory. We can maybe expect a visit, tonight. It's possible. You have everything closed up? - Yes. Front and back! Gentlemen! This is Tom Defoe. He wants to spend some time sheltering from justice... so, he will be spending some time with us. What is it? - Tom Defoe, is he here? You shouldn't be here. Clear off! It's no use. Let's go. I absolutely must speak to him. You go if you like. You're driving me crazy! I don't know anymore what I should do. Good evening, Mr. Heep. Show me that. A gentleman and a lady who were going to see the King. Emeralds. Not bad. These gentlemen and ladies were of fine stock. Look at the outfit of the lady. High class. That wig has no value. But to get the tiara, we had to take it. At last! Mr. Tom is an educated young man. He'll tend to the accounts. Who did it before? Leslie. A very competent boy. Dead, alas. Alas. Too impulsive. He was always impulsive. Good. All this doesn't concern me. Our pistols are worthless. They're the best in London! Mine will not fire. The hammer is locked. The hammer is locked? Indeed. Look! Help me. Can you see anything? - Yes, he's there. Tom Defoe? - Yes. But you can't go in. They're armed... they would kill you. Good evening. Excuse me, is Maud there? No, Mrs Cantley. Ben isn't there either. I've been looking everywhere, without success. They went home... but then they left together. She has never done this. What are they doing at night? Mrs Cantley. The children have gone to Rue de la Lune. I went to Mr. Ranson's, his Charly hasn't returned. He left a note saying he wouldn't be back. Say, Charly. - What? It's midnight. I'm wondering if the captain will come. Of course he'll come. - And otherwise? Otherwise shut up! He has to wait for the tide. - Yes, but... Why are you late? - What's happened? He stole Robinson . Who ? - His son stole Robinson . We cannot leave... because of Maud. We cannot leave. Where is she? - Go look for Oliver and Georgie. It needs more than that! And if we don't find Robinson He will die. - No! Yes, he'll die. I've seen it. Come! Charly, I'm going with Ben. Go away then, idiots! But without me! I'm not going back to Mr. Gillis. Go on, Maud. The man at the door wouldn't let us enter. I'll knock. I'm small, he won't see me. I'll knock until he opens, and then... Hide yourself. Who is there? Look! It must be somone. I see nobody. It must be Hawkins and his band. I told you they would come. Very well. They'll be received like they should be. In place! It's bizarre, there's nobody. The door didn't open by itself. Anyone there? I don't understand. Hands up! It's not Hawkins' guys. Close it! What do you want? It's a trap, Mr. Heep! Tom Defoe, give us the book you stole from your father. You recognise these kids? Never seen them. What? Me, as well? Look at me, if you still can. I'm ashamed for you. I tried. I promised you, but... Let go of me. You are bad, bad! What are we going to do? What are we going to do with these rascals? Stop! Calm down or watch out! We've nothing against you. It's him we want! It's for that that you're attacking us? Throw me out! That's it, throw us all. It can't be too difficult. We are only children. Here's a nice jolly sir. He got me into prison. He promised me he'd seek forgiveness from his father. What one promises a poor girl is of no importance, eh? I shouldn't have been so stupid. It's my fault. It's the fault of his father, he let him steal the book! Tom Defoe is to blame for nothing. He's a good guy, a handsome sir! Calm down a little! You're letting her speak? - You are safe here. You are courageous. Your father will die if we don't find Robinson. Find Robinson! What is it with Robinson? He stole from his father the manuscript for Robinson. To pay my debt. It has been arranged. But for Robinson The manuscript of Robinson Who is it? Idiot, don't you read? Excuse me, Mr. Heep, but you don't either. They've read it to me. Read and re-read That, it's a story. And you have sold the manuscript? - Yes, and so what? Imbecile! I would have given you 1000 pounds. That manuscript will end up in the British Museum! Stop, that book is a tissue of lies. Children, I cannot give you the manuscript... but you can take him. I don't want to hear any more from him. Thank you, Mr. Heep. Charly! I couldn't let you down. I arrived at the right moment. We are good Christians. We cannot let this happen. What do you know of Robinson? Bunch of idiots! Untie me! If you return the book. And how, wise guy? You think the dealer will just hand it back? Be reasonable! I don't want to be reasonable. I'm not helping you again. Never mind! What are you going to do with me? Tell me. Say, Maud... what will we do with him? - I don't know. I'm going to give him a good thrashing. Me too - and not a little. Ah, you can laugh! You won't be laughing for long. Someone will punish you. There's nobody. - Yes! There will surely be someone. There is always someone who punishes us. But we are children. Before we return him to Mr. Gillis, we'll settle this account. Good grief, Mr. Gillis! I'd forgotten. What? The wall and the dyeing! What wall? We did something stupid. Don't say anything. - It doesn't matter. What is it? We wanted to leave, Jim, Ben and me. We wanted to live on the island, like Robinson. On the island, like Robinson! Shut up! You wanted to leave? Leave London? And like an idiot, I came back. There's still a chance. - A chance? It's your fault. The island! There is no island. My father invented it all. The whole book is an invention! How do you know? Ask Maud. Maud... It's true? - What? What he says. That there is no island. No, it's not true. It's not true! He lies! The island exists? Of course. Tom Defoe is a liar... but not his father. The island exists. And it's hot there, eh? It is very hot. It is always hot there. Not just the summer. It never snows. It is always fine. Believe me, the island exists. And it is as Robinson described it? Yes, exactly. The same palm trees. The same hill. And the beach. Invention! There was never the island, nor Robinson! Don't listen to Tom Defoe! Soon, you will not laugh. Hello. It is absolutely necessary that I speak to the King. Listen to me! It's terrible. We don't know what to do. I know that you can't speak to me... but you can understand. You just need to open the gate. There must be someone to whom I can speak! It's desperate. What's with all the preventing people from speaking? A King who permits that isn't worth very much! Tell him when you see him! In front of the King, you can speak. What are you saying about the King? Who are you? - And you, who are you? I'm called Maud Cantley. You say the King is worthless? Yes. It may be that something important goes on in London... and the King knows nothing about it. What is so important? Plenty of things! Only the King can still help me. Plus, he knows Mr. Defoe. He surely must not want his death? Mr. Daniel Defoe? - Yes. You know him? - I live with him. He lives with us... You would repeat to the King that he is worthless? Yes, why? I will take you to him. You will? We are going to see the King? One moment. "We"? I am not alone. We are about thirty. Thirty? Nothing but children? - Yes. Jim, Ben, Charly and the others. We've been walking all night. More and more interesting... go get them. I'll be waiting for you at the castle. Thank you. His Majesty called me? Yes, Mr. Pum. I'm expecting some people for an audience. An audience? Now, Majesty? Yes, I know it is a little early. Prepare breakfast. Breakfast? A hearty breakfast for thirty people. For thirty people? Majesty, the cook isn't yet ready. Mr. Pum, these people have been walking all night. Maud, I don't like the look of this. He was playing a joke on us. Go on, go on. Take me to the King. You're scared? Stay here, I'll look around. Rebellion! Guards! Come quick. It's the ones with the arrows. Rebellion! Guards! What are you doing here? We've come to see the King. His Majesty? - Yes! Don't laugh! The kind sir told us to come. What kind sir? Him. What is it, Mr. Pum? Why are you holding back... my guests? These are your... Ben! My child! Yes, Papa- You're back! We were worried sick. If you will allow me, Mr. Drinkwater? This is your son? Yes, Majesty. I beg your pardon. The children wanted to embark, leave the country. Leave the country? You never told me this, Maud Cantley. The children want to leave? Majesty. You are the King? Yes, I am the King who is worthless. Mr. the King... Majesty... I did not know. It is nothing. So then, you are Ben. Who is Charly? Who is Jim? It's me. - I am Jim. And who is this? I know you. It's Tom Defoe. - Yes, Majesty, I am Tom Defoe. What have you done to him? We have made him our prisoner. He stole from his father. He stole Robinson . we must find the book. It is true, Tom? - It's true, Majesty. I cannot believe it. - Yes, yes, Majesty. I am a thief. Me, the son of the great Daniel Defoe! Do not talk about that here. I'm going to make you a proposition. You must be hungry after all that walking. And how! Mr. Pum, conduct my guests to Prince George. Go on, Mr. Pum. Please... - You two, follow me. These are my guests, Mr. Pum? Yes, Highness. We wanted to retrieve the book, but we couldn't. He had already sold it. For 50 pounds. They were tight-fisted! - And you bring this to me? Yes, Majesty. You have the power. What you say, must happen. How did it come to this, Tom Defoe? Majesty, if you knew! He is worthless. Everyone is worthless, for you. I remember you, Tom Defoe. As a child, you used to visit and play in the park. Those were happy times, Majesty. Alas, they have passed. I think it is not your fault... if I have quarrelled with your father. It is the truth, Majesty. Do you believe I'd be where I am... if he was still in your service? Your father wanted to protect his liberty. His liberty, his liberty! It was his pride! He had his liberty and we had nothing to eat. I had to leave school. I had no clothes. But him, he had his liberty! Now, I understand. It is your father's fault that you are a thief... and in a sense, it is my fault. Answer me! I will be punished for what I've done. You realise that you must be punished. What do you say, Maud Cantley? Yes, he deserves punishment. Good, then send him to prison. No! I just got him out of there. Good. In the eyes of the law, he is a thief. I could have him hanged. No, Majesty! No, please. Or made into a sailor. No. Please. My dear Maud Cantley, I do not understand. You wanted him punished, and when I'm going to punish him, you say: "No, please". I want Mr. Defoe to recover his book. Then, there is a possibility... Tom Defoe, I wonder if if you would rend me a service. A service, Majesty? Yes, a service. You know what difficulties... your father has caused me with his books. Yes, Majesty. You carry also the name of Defoe. It is a name people know. If you openly declare... that your father is wrong in all his writings, that he has ruined his life, that you are on the side of the King... and that you have contempt for your father, then I will pardon you. Do not demand this. I cannot. You cannot? Why would he? His father is a wonderful man. Nevertheless, he stole from him. Isn't it so? Yes, Majesty. What I've done is despicable. Punish me. I will not say I have contempt for my father. Why? - It's a lie, I don't have contempt for him. Good... but you could pretend. No. I cannot, Majesty. You cannot, because your opinion is not for sale. It is what you reproach your father for. You see how similar you are, you and your father? Good... then, I have another proposition. Yes, Majesty, what is it? Open that chest. It contains scholarships. Take one and bring it to me. It is full of gold. You are convinced that I helped ruin your life. No, Majesty. - Good... there may be some truth in that. I would like to make up for my mistake. Take this gold. It will atone. - Yes, but... Think carefully about what you are going to do. You are free. Majesty... Come. Come find your friends. But, Majesty... - Come. Am I right? If you knew, Majesty... If you knew... It is not easy, even for a King. Excuse me, Majesty, I don't know what to think anymore. I believe that you like Mr. Defoe. And? You came to his defense before Tom. My dear Maud, a king must learn to recognise... his mistakes when he makes them. I tell you this in confidence. I am grateful to you... for coming to see me with Tom Defoe and the children. Mr. Pum! - Highness? We are out of chocolate. - Chocolate! Who wants more cake? Mr. Pum! Cake! Cake! We cannot ask him... to be nice to us. Ah yes, the arrow. - Exactly. It was sharp... but I was shooting at the tree. What happy company... it's a joy to see... isn't it, Mr. Pum? - Yes, Majesty. I see that you love children. Yes, Majesty, who could not love these dear little ones? Majesty, I can do no more. I am feeling unwell. Allow me to retire. Please. - Thank you! Prince George. Here is Maud Cantley. I'm delighted to meet you. How are you? Highness... I hope this visit was not inconvenient. No, Majesty, quite the contrary. One more thing. Who, apart from Ben, wanted to leave the country tonight? Me. - Please, you must understand. They shouldn't have, but life is hard with Mr. Gillis. Who is Mr. Gillis? The cotton mill. You don't know it? You work down there? Tell him, Maud... Ah, yes! Majesty, the children cannot go back there. They have done something stupid. Without Tom Defoe, they would already be at sea. You would be en route for the island of Robinson. Exactly! I will take care of that... and many other things... don't worry. Will you sit down? Some chocolate? No, thank you very much. I'd rather go home. My mother doesn't know where I am. You are right. Thank you for the book, Tom. And not only for the book... also... thank you for coming back. Forgive me, father. You too... You too, must forgive me. We make great plans. We want to accomplish great things... and we become blind. We lose sight of the little things. Yes, Tom, yes... I became blind. I did not pay enough attention to you. I waited for you to show me the love... that I had never given you. What is that? It's Maud. What does it mean? Good day, Mme Cantley. I came to see Mr. Defoe. My God! You cannot... I mean to say... I don't know... My laundry... - Mama! Do not worry, Mrs Cantley. Come, Majesty. Mr. Tom! Maud! Daniel Defoe... I come late, after many years. But I hope it is not too late. I thank you... for helping my son. I did nothing... it is Maud who helped. It was the children who helped. They brought the King to see Mr. Defoe. He is visiting him. You were right. We must think about our children... you and me. You expressed the desire that they shouldn't work. They should not. They should not be dreaming... of the island of Robinson, but should be happy on my island. We must bring this about, you and me. It is our duty. Your duty, Majesty... I'm afraid I will have to leave you this task. You will heal, Mr. Defoe. Nothing more keeps me here. I feel that I shall soon be leaving this world. But that is not important. The important thing is, it is that the dream of my island... continues to live. Robinson... Robinson must not die. Take the book, Maud... read me the end. "Like all the other days, "I went up the hill... "to view the immensity of the sea. "The immensity of the sea..." "That morning, it was more peaceful and calm... "than ever. "The fog had gone. "The sun was shining, dazzling. "Nothing on the horizon. "I was descending the hill... "when I saw a ship to the south. "In all haste, I lit the fire ”that as it burned, sent up a column of smoke. The ship changed course for my island. ”As she appraoched... ”I knew that I was saved. ”I would be leaving this world where I had been so unhappy... ”and so happy. ”
