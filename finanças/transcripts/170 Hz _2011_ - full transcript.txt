Will I see you again soon? Of course. Did you see your father's new car? Let's go away. What do you mean? The two of us, together. And go where? To the moon. We'll just take off. You and me. Will you come and watch? Maybe. Change the cylinder head gasket. New cylinder head gasket. Where were you last night? Out, and where were you? We were at home. Sounds like fun, just the two of you. Where were you last night? You've never asked me this before. - I did just now and I'm asking you again. I was with a boy. What boy? You saw him. What's his name? Was I not allowed to? Then you should tell me. You father didn't say that. His name is Nick. Bring him over sometime. It's the deaf guy. Hey you, deaf guy! I think he can hear us all right. Hey... give me the ball back. Can't you hear me or what? Did you hear that? And that? Can you hear this? He really doesn't hear me. Hey, now you can't talk either? I've heard you talk. You moron. I guess... I'll have to get it myself then. Ball! You fucking moron! An original? Why don't you get a hearing implant... just like Evy is getting? I'm not getting one and you know it! I don't need to hear anything. I haven't met anyone who seems to have anything interesting to say... apart from Evy. Do you like it? Do you? It's very good. What does your father do? I'm not there... so he's probably wanking off by himself. I don't want to see him here again! Then I'll go to him! You're not going anywhere! I'll decide that. I'd rather be with him than with you. I'm sorry. Where do I think I'm going? Go on, ask me! Again? Are you sure? There's only one way to be united forever. And we won't return... until I've been carrying it for five months. All right. Are you sure? Yes. So? In two weeks' time. Why are we leaving earlier? Because of my Dad? What happened? What is it? You've got such nice hands. You've told me before. I love you. You've told me that too. Do you love me too? Can I get a kiss? You have such a strange expression sometimes. Captain Nick. Why did we leave earlier? Because of my Dad? I've made something special for you. What is it? What? Our swimming pool Don't. You Okay? What are you writing? About us. What exactly? That's a secret, obviously. Or would you rather be alone? Wouldn't you rather be alone?! Would you miss me... if you weren't with me now? I came looking for you because I missed you. Would you miss me if you weren't with me here... but at home or wherever? I'm here, aren't I? But what if you weren't... would you miss me then? Of course I would. What have you done? Nothing. Did you send a text message? Yes. To your mother? Yes! Saying what? - Saying you're a prick. Did you tell her where we are? You bastard! I'm sorry. You still haven't told me why we left earlier than planned. Will you stay with me forever? Of course. I really mean forever. Don't ever hit me again. Last word? "Death ." What are you reading? "The only purpose of life is..." "...having enough time to prepare for death." You've read this book before, haven't you? What's the most beautiful thing you've ever seen? Shall I tell you what I once heard? What do you mean, "heard"? There was one time I heard something, it was eight years ago. The doctor didn't believe me. But I'm sure of it. Wonderful... fresh... like... lemon ice cream. If I could choose my voice, it would sound like that. And then I would also... sing... and whisper. But above all I'd scream. What about you? What's the most beautiful thing you've ever seen? Or heard? The most beautiful thing I've ever seen... was you, yesterday. Why did you change my diary? What if we have a child? And why did you write "I hate my mother"? Would you love the child more than you love me? Crazy' Congratulations, Daddy. I've never kissed a girl. Me neither. I feel something. It's my heart. Do you want something to drink? Don't! Shall we dance? Come on, let's dance. Where have you been? You'll be a better mother than I'd be a father. No, you. You. No, you'll be better. You're confused because of the pregnancy. No, you... you're crazy. I'm glad we'll be going back soon. I'm not going back. I can't go back. But I thought we'd be going back the three of us. I can't go back. Why not? You don't understand. What have you done? Were you going to leave? I was going for a swim. Isn't it a little cold? Did you ask the captain? You can. Go on. I'll protect you. Are you scared of me? This is the first time you're lying to me. Go on then! You won't leave me alone? You won't leave me alone? Is it cold.
