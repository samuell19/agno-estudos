- I love you - - I love you - - I love you - - Delete message? - - Message deleted - - Excuse me, teacher. - Yes! - We're waiting for class to start. - Oh, right. Let's go. Sorry. Good morning. - Good morning. - Oh... it's you. You don't drive to school? I live close to here. I live at Daesung Apartments. - Oh, really? - Why? You live there too? No, Hae-Joo does. You know UH Hae-Joo, right? - Right... I know her. - That's great... I'll give you a ride home next time. - Good morning. - Hi. - Right. - So that's where you live. All the people I like live at Daesung Apartments. It's Hae-Joo! - I'll see you later, teacher. - Sure. Hae-Joo! - Hey...! - What? Mister Suh! Who are you running with at the tournament tomorrow? Yes? - At the three-legged race. - Oh yeah... Since your class is all guys, you want to run with the fastest kid, right? Let's see who's the fastest in your class. CHO Jae-Il. He's the fastest. He ran 100 meters in 12.2 seconds. Mister Suh and Jae-Il Cho for class five. Wait a minute... Please line up at the starting line for the three-legged race. Teacher, I'll shout the steps. One for the tied leg, and two for the other. Ready! Hyun-Bin, it's your teacher. I noticed your report wasn't in the pile. You turned it in? Okay, I'll look for it again. Then do a... See you tomorrow. Okay, take care. It's not scary at all. You know the Gyro Drop, right? Now that's a scary ride. After you go up slowly and it stops at the top, you feel like you're falling forever once it drops. Sure, I'll pick you up. Yeah. Okay, good night. Bye. What is it? Who the hell are you talking to for so long? Is it Hae-Joo? Is that you teacher? Yeah... it's me, your teacher. It's just that I called for over an hour and it was busy. I'm sorry for yelling. You got scared, huh? Okay, so... Well, good night. Didn't you call because you had something to say? Oh yeah... that's right... No, it's just that... Let's talk at school tomorrow. But tomorrow's Sunday. It's Sunday tomorrow? That's right. Then rest tomorrow and I'll see you on Monday. Bye... What are you doing? I'm drawing. - What are you drawing? - Art. - You pervert! - What? It's pretty. You're always imagining these things. So then... You're going to strip for me? You jerk. This is why I have to imagine all the time! - Your hand is cold. - Yeah. Since I have a warm heart. - What? - Let me touch it just once. - What? - Your breast. You pervert! - I can't believe you! - I'm not a pervert! - I said I'm not a pervert. - You jerk. - I was wandering in da alleyway. ..."the" alleyway. ...in the alleyway, and I felt I - Was walking on a strange streed. ...strange "street"! ...on a strange street for ad least five years. ..."at" least five years! ...for at least five years wondering lonesomely. ...wondering? Wandering! Wandering... Only kids pronounce like that. I felt like I almost died. - What's wrong with him today? - He was so strange. So he never makes a mistake too? I hate him! Correcting your mistakes is his job. What? It's not like you got scolded. He just pointed out your mistakes. You don't have to hate him for that. Are you taking his side? Come on, that's stupid. Let me down! I wanna walk! You sure? See you later. Honey... I gave birth to Joo-Yun, right? Of course not. I'm the one. I'm a man, right? There's nothing wrong with me, right? Let's eat, Joo-Yun. Here. - SUH In-Woo! - Yes. First of all, your test results are quite normal. You seem proud of your sexuality more than others. And the results show that you're normally attracted to women. Well, you'll probably need a few more tests. But in my opinion, I would say that your curiosity in the same sex should be taken comfortably like its part of human nature. I see... Hey, didn't we see this at that place before? It's so amazing. Anyway, I felt something special from the second artwork. How about you? Wasn't it really fun? But I felt like I've seen that last one before. It was weird. You're gonna buy it? This lighter is handmade. You better not get caught with it at school. Hey... - Is this woman famous? - I don't know. Why? It's really familiar. I felt like I've seen this somewhere before. Don't buy it! I don't like you looking at other women. Give it to me. Another common mistake is wrong and different. The phrase "I'm wrong from you" is incorrect. You have to say "I'm different from you." "Wrong" means incorrect. And "different" means not the same. Then why does "sudgarak" have a "d" in it? Who said that? IM Hyun-Bin. I'm sorry, sir. Choksuk pavilion chases time like an arrow in the rainstorm. Non-gae, you make me smile and cry at the same time. You're one of the great flowers blossoming on legendary graves. So your scent never turns rotten. As a poet, I became your lover. Where are you now? IM Hyun-Bin. Who the hell is this? Who are you? Hyun-Bin, who are you? Who the hell are you? Hey, has our teacher gone crazy lately? You don't like him anymore? I don't even want to call him teacher. Looks like your loyalty stayed alive till the end. but he suddenly stops when he saw Hyun-Bin wasn't laughing. Hey, that's enough. I didn't know at first, but I think he feels something for you. He didn't punish you like a normal teacher would. It's like he was getting angry at his lover. There's a lot of talk going around school. - What talk? - That our teacher is gay. And that you're no different. Hey, if a guy likes another guy then they're both gay? Your neighbor thinks you're a cute guy. So both of you are gay, too? What are you talking about? We're just worried about you... Hey... You think he's looking at you like a normal teacher would? After I'm born again, I'm going to look for you. And when I do, I'll fall in love with you again. Really? But how will you know if it's me in my next life? I'll recognize you. I'll know. How? I'm going to fall in love again with someone else. - Right? - Yeah. That person will be you. No way. Then all you have to do is love someone else and insist that it's me. No, I'll know. If it's not you, then I won't be able to love someone else. Doesn't our teacher seem like a homo? I'm telling you he does. Did you see what happened before? What? He pretended to walk around, and touched Hyun-Bin's hand. - Are you serious? - Yeah. - That's sick. - Isn't it disgusting? It makes me wanna vomit. - Hyun-Bin! - What the hell! - You ass hole! - Let go! Let go! Let go of me! You dickheads! Are you some fighting chickens? You beat each other's head with a mop, and you call that just a scuffle? Are you a gangster? Mobster? Thug? Hoodlum? Yakuza? - Hey, Young-Ho. - Yes, sir. You explain. Why did you fight? What's going on here? Spit it out, Hyun-Bin! Why did you hit them? You're not going to talk? I heard you hit them first! Why did you do it? I said why did you? What's wrong with our language teacher lately? Since there's a rumor about him and Hyung-bin, he's trying to prove that it's not true. Why did you do it? It's me. Are you all right? Oh, it's you. Are you hurt? You saw it? - I'm all right. - Tell me. - Why did the teacher only beat you? - Hae-joo. I'm really tired right now. Let's talk about it at school tomorrow. Why do you get upset whenever I mention your teacher? It's just that I'm tired. You didn't know what they're talking about? Hey, Hyun-Bin! Your boyfriend's here. I'm sorry. Please throw the ball back. Oh, I'm sorry. Please throw it back again. What do you think you're doing? What's wrong with you? What's wrong with me? What's wrong with you? Teacher... What the hell is going on? What the hell is going on? - Honey. - Joo-Yun's sleeping. Let's wake up our Joo-Yun. - Go in the room, okay? - Joo-Yun! Let's go in. - Honey. - What? Honey. What's wrong? Honey! You're drunk. Let's go to sleep, okay? Stop it. What's wrong with you? You know I... Wait a minute. Honey. You're drunk. Let's talk about it later. Okay? Go to sleep. Please stop it. Stop it... Honey. What's wrong with you? Stop it. What's wrong with you? Stop it I said. Honey... Are you having an affair? No. Attention! - Bow! - Good morning... Where were you? Did you go drinking? Teacher. I heard you're gay. I heard you like me. Rumors have spread all across school. Since there's no turning back, should we really start dating? Huh? Teacher... Tae-hee. How come you... Can't even remember me a little? I can feel you. I know it's you. Good morning. Attention! - Bow! - Good morning... I guess the janitor forgot to erase the board today. - This... - It's a condom. You should be careful of AIDS. What are you guys doing? Let's go! If you stay here, all of you will catch AIDS. Hey, Min-Woo! Let's go! Okay. Let's begin class. Today... Teacher, the principal wants to see you. Teacher. Take care of yourself. Are you really gay? No. Then what? I love only one person. If you're going to love that one person, it has to be a seventeen year-old student? No. Tae-Hee. Who? Tae-Hee? You are insane. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. But... I can't help it. Is it true? It's a lie, isn't it? It's not true, right? I'm the one you like! I'm the one! One, two, three... One, two, three... Isn't it easy? It's simple. Are you still in there? Sir! Are you in there, sir? How many days is this...? The rain looks so refreshing. Hey... I have to go. What are you doing? What is that? Stand up. Give that to me. You better stop right there! Hey student! He was like that throughout class. Shouldn't we do something about him? Give him a break. He probably feels terrible, too. At the last tournament, Mr. Suh wanted to run with Hyun-Bin. - That's when it seemed strange. - That's not all. That time Hyun-Bin... - I'll run with IM Hyun-Bin. - IM Hyun-Bin? Wait a minute. He's already signed up to play basketball. I see... Okay, then anyone will be fine. Okay, CHO Jae-Il. Why are you here? Classes already began. I came to talk to the phys ed teacher. Then hurry and go to class. I... Instead of playing basketball, Hyun-bin switched to the three-legged race. He said his friend wanted to play basketball. So he asked to change games. I thought nothing of it then. Of course, I'll go with you. Just in case I'm late, you better wait for me, okay? This... You better come back before my feelings change. Okay? I better look at you a lot before you leave for the military. Come here. What are you doing? Looking at your face only once isn't enough. I need more. I don't want to waste a second. Since I'll miss you too much. Hey kid! Are you all right? You came. I'm sorry. I'm really late, huh? Better late than never. You think I'll die if I jump? No. Even if you jump, it won't end there. This time I'll be born as a girl. But what if I'm born as a girl, too? I guess I'll wait again. If you jumped from a cliff, you said your life wouldn't end there. We'll meet again and fall in love. It's not because I love you. It's because all I can do is love you, I love you forever.
