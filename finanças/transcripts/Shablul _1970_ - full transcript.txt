DVD / DVDRip Duration: 1:14:17 FPS: 25 See that? Great, just great. Come a bit closer. -Where? -Here. I don't mind the camera, as long as I don't notice. Yes. -That's it. Get a bit closer to the basket, Arik. Sure, but what do you want me to do? I want you to ignore me. Not so fast. Yes! "No points". -Not so fast, I'm not a movie camera. Just play, talk to me, tell me things, don't mind me. Slowly, slowly. Play. -You want to hear story? -All right, tell me a story. What do you want me to tell? -Just anything. "Shablul" Arik Einstein The Cherchils Shalom Hanoch Yehudit Sola Uri Zohar Directed by: Boaz Davidzon How long do you plan to keep this up? -Until you get tired. "What do you do when you get up every morning? "All the usual things, but much more slowly. "What do you see when you get up every morning? "Hardly ever the same girl, no, not the same one. "Hardly ever the same girl, no, not the same one." It tires you out, just tires you out. Tires you... Miss Lihi! Coffee, for two. Good song. Shalom Hanokh's song went from 10th place to 8th. And vice versa. Just one leap off the chart, and it's gone. There's no sugar, Arik. -Lihi streaked her hair today. -Yes. I'm going to bed. -See you. Time for beddy bye. We've traded places, I'm... getting divorced, and you're married. -I made a great bachelor. I used to rent this apartment just opposite the Rabbinate. With her, with Yudit. Why'd we even bring this up? It turns out... Anyway, turns out artists have the most... issues like this with their families. -You know, the fact that she... loves me less, it somehow hurts my... male ego, my... stupid male ego, I don't know. But I can't control it. -You keep going on about how it hurts your ego. -I didn't say... It shouldn't, because it's got nothing to do with that. Right. -I imagine it'll happen to me someday, too, because I think anybody who's close to someone who creates, they're attracted to it somehow. If you keep your distance, willingly or otherwise, and do your own thing while leaving her out of it, and it's sure to make her anxious, make her feel she's missing out on everything. I think maybe I sort of do involve her in what I do, meaning I... -Sure, of course you do, all right? The quiet, the music... What? And she's a delicacy in bed, wrapped in another delicacy. She's an actress, that's why. It's the answer to all her problems, seriously. You, for instance, you've been married a month, you know this and not just because we've talked about it, although... I know, because my wife and I talk about it. -Well, I've had enough talk, get it? I'm sick of talking, being... anxious. -That's just it. Her desire to be part of it all, to be a partner, is only the desire to be your partner. But what if, for instance, I were to make a movie, yeah? Well... never mind. -You see? That's just it. You won't even tell me, you hide inside your shell, snail. You're in no rush to get married, huh? I'm never getting married again! "Night after night. "Don't you give up on me, no, no, no, no, don't you give up "on me. "Night after night", and it ends like this... End it like you started it, I mean... The first verse... -We've also gotta... By the way, we're recording it this week. Not how, not how, damn it all... Haim, there're too many bits like... "Uptown there's a garden, "there's a garden uptown, "screw around in it, and your wiener breaks down. "If you remember who I am"... -Come on! "Who he is, "who she is. "If you know who I'm not, "who I am, who I am. "I'm singing. "Singing! "In bed there's a woman, "there's a woman in bed, "and if she likes you "Then she'll sleep with you! "If you remember who I am.." -Schwartzman! "Who he is, "who she is. "If you know who I'm not, "who I am, who I am‚Äù" We're just wrapping this up. "I'm singing. "Singing! "A peach is full of juice, "there's juice inside the peach, "shake your ass a dozen times, "it'll grow an inch for each. "If you remember who I am, "who he is, "who she is. "If you know who I'm not, "who I am, who I am. "If you remember who I am, "who he is, "who she is. "If you know..." Right there, there's that... -Guys, I gotta dash. You'll keep working on it with them, then? -Hey... -OK. 40 minutes, half an hour, you're driving us crazy... I've gotta go, can't help it. Well, see you. Bye. Goodbye. What comes after this bit...? Do that bit on my cue. Look, check this out a sec! Want to shoot one? "Don't you deceive me, "night after night. "Don't you lose sight of me, "don't you lose sight. "Don't deceive me, "night after night. "Don't you give up on me, no, no, don't you give up "on me. "Don't you drive me away, "night after night. "Don't despise me, "do not despise me. "Don't you drive me away, "night after night. "Don't you give up on me, no, no, don't you give up "on me. "Don't you seduce me, "night after night. "Don't you give up on me, no, no, no, no, don't you give up "on me. "Don't despise me, "night after night. "Don't you give up on me, no, no, no, no, don't you give up "on me. "Don't deceive me, "night after night. "Don't you give up on me, no, no, no, no, don't you give up "on me." Go on, make me some coffee, already. What, are you upset? -I'm not upset, I want coffee.

"Life is beautiful, just like a play, "what more do I need than this? "what more do I need than this? "what more do I need than this?" Say "ahh". Look right. Left. Up. Down. Get on the scale. Strip. Hold your breath. -What is that, my heart? Don't breathe. -But, what...? What's that noise? What is it? What do you hear? What could that be? Hush! -What's it called? -Inhale deeply. Deeper! There's noise there, too? And here? What is that, my liver? My heart? -Not good. -So, what do I do? How long have you had these aches? Since yesterday evening. -Since when yesterday evening? Yesterday evening, how would I know? How would you know? When yesterday evening? Yesterday evening, at work, that's when... Well, what happened at work? What happened? -Search me, they just beat me within an inch of my life, and... Beat you?! -Yeah, lay a real wallop on my head, too. What could it be? What do I do, Doctor? What can I day? -I'll tell you what you've got to do: Learn to hit back. Could you teach me how to beat people up? I want to learn how to rough people up. I... I'd also like to stop getting hit, in brief, "To make the story short". I've been getting hurt a lot recently, let me tell you, when my hormones are in full bloom, I get beat up lots. I make passes at girls, and I... dunno, I... Could I...? Study with you...? You know, karate, jiu jitsu? Come on, I want to cause some hurt. Just a crash course, whatever... goes well with beatings today, you know, punches, anything like that'll do for me. Is that a problem, will you teach me, can you...? Well, are you a teacher? Are you a karate teacher? Can I sign up, can I? You know this sorta slap you have...? Punches...? My little lamb, you want to learn karate and jiu jitsu and judo. So that you can defend yourself. I see that. Within you burns a Jewish heart! I will teach you, my redheaded stepchild. You speak Yiddish? One or two words. -That's enough. Can you say "Oy vey", in Yiddish? Say "Oy vey"... One or two words... I will teach you, my child, karate, jiu jitsu and judo. Are you afraid of me? Fear is good. Observe, my child, the first pillar of judo is the rump. The rump is the fulcrum of balance in your life. Observe. Right, left, the rump is the key to balance. Do as I do. Right, left, outwards. Nice. Wiggle it a little. Lovely. That gives you balance. Enough. Next come the hands. The hands are perpendicular to the rump, check your rump is aligned with your hand. One, two, kati cha! Do you know what "kati cha" means, in Japanese? Say "kati cha" Good. Come closer, don't be scared. Remember, two cornerstones: hands and rump. Your hands, hold them out, like a herring! That way you'll have a Japanese face. The third pillar is the eyes. Look into my eyes, and learn, darling child. Closer, don't be afraid, a pox on your sweet eyes. Watch. This is called "kati cha 2". Your eyes should burn, with murder! Look, look, look! Understand? Murder in your eyes! Good, good! Use your eyes. Now, take your stance, with your rump out. Further out... Hold your rump out right. Hands this way. Where do you hold your hands? Look that way... rump out. Murder in your eyes, murder in your eyes! Murder... Hands out, hands out! Take off that stupid hat. Hands out, murder in your eyes. Hold that pose! Let me ask you a question. Why do you need karate? Just look how pretty you are, my little lamb. With your spectacular rump, that magnificent pose, murder in your eyes! What do you need karate for? It's no good, it's for hooligans. You're so pretty. Take me to your rabbi. Sir, what do you want, sir? -Put your head on my shoulder! Shut up, and rest your head! You can cry if you want to. Cry, cry... What do you want? Don't be afraid my little lamb, we'll soon be married, and have redheaded Jewish children who know karate.

I'd like an exhaustive news item in... On the noble endeavors of... of Arik and Shissel. Many of our readers want to know, what aftershave do you use? -Chanson de la Fan Fan. Fan Fan. -Fan Fan. Fan Fan. -It's not Eau de Cologne? It's that, too. -It's Eau de Cologne, too. Good for the toes. -Can I call you an underground vocalist? You'd better, yeah. Have you got...? That is, have you any plans for overseas? Loads. -Plans for your singing career, I mean? -Dancing, too. Musicals, then. -Musicals, sing-alongs, the works. Arik... This one's really unorthodox. You with me? Yeah. -Would... All the songs you sing on the show, would you be willing to sing them all in Dutch? Tell me, are you really a journalist? -Next question. Do you use... Special means of maintaining your figure? Massage. -Lots of massage, yeah. And I don't eat? -Does that affect your performances? I get kind of hungry, but that's the price you pay. Do you still get your hair cut at Freddy's? -Yes. What kind of paper is this, buddy? -It's not underground, I'll just get that question out of the way, it's not, but it's fresh, I mean, we don't want to rehash all the conventional questions, we want to try new things. -Tell me, who are you? Who sent you? -I'll tell you two things Who? How'd you find us? -It's a youth magazine. That'll be... Really, circulated chiefly within the youth demographic. Right. -What's your opinion of the Music Festival? Got any more interesting questions? -Do you believe it was the drugs that broke the Beatles up? -Sure, too many nargilas. -I just wanted to ask, Mr. Shissel. Please. -What's your schedule, as manager? -A tad short, I get up at 12:00. -At night? -At noon. And I sort of get the ball rolling, go to my office... Make calls, whatever... At 2:00, I go to sleep again. I've got to be well rested. My kidneys are a touch fickle. So I sleep about 14, 16 hours a day. Get up at 4:00... Take a shower, go to sleep. And at night? -I sleep best at night. -All night long? Will you be distributing these in the major cities, too? Mostly in the south? -Why the south? There's more youth there. What was behind the beard? Why did you shave it off? -Acne. What's this paper's print run, anyway? It's... Unlimited, I think. How many copies do you print? -We print... I mean, it's unlimited, we... Get it all printed at once. -Let it go. -Let it go. Why did you divorce? -What? -Who, who sent you? What is this paper? -Who are you? What's all this bullshit? What do you want? Who sent you? -Starkman. -Starkman? Look, then, you take Starkman, and both of you just go "kibinimatres". Kibinimatres. -What the hell is all this?! -Go kibinimatres! Go kibinimatres! Go kibinimatres! Go kibinimatres! Scram! -Get the papers! Go kibinimatres! Take this with you! -Get the papers. Go away, God damn it. -Go away, you... Go away, you kib... Fuck off! Go away, I said!
