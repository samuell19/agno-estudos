(crowd murmuring) - Well mama, what's the line up? - Two women, two men in a side. You, Miriam. - Oh tish with that. This is just a practice game. The women against the men. - I'm for that always. (people laughing) - And how. Hello dad. - Hello Lally. - [Male Polo Player] How are you Lally? - How do ya, everybody? - [Male Polo Player] Rather an experience this playing against women. - Oh don't be too chivalrous. We're gonna beat the everlasting daylights out of ya. (people laughing) - Let's go, all right? - Fine. - Kinda wish I was playing with you, dad. - Yeah, so do I. - Not that I won't get an awful kick out of walloping you. - Walloping me? - Yeah. Well aren't you a conceited little? - Well, I'm going to or die trying. - Oh Lally don't. Don't ever say a thing like that again even in fun. - Oh, bless his little heart. - Up ya go. - Give the ol' lady a boost. - [Male Polo player] All right, right with ya Linda, let's go. Wait for me, Linda! - Now Lally, you won't be reckless? - That's great coming from you (laughs). (people cheering) (crowd chattering) Egad, that goal was a peachy one. Just a dandy shot! - Not so bad for an old timer, eh? - Oh, you. Be yourself! Go to it, dad. Take your bows, take your bows. - [Crowd Member] Nice work, Charlie! (people cheering) (woman screaming) (crowd chattering) - Lally, Lally. Lally, oh Miriam I've hurt her, I've. - Steady on, old man. She's winded, that's all. - Oh, thank God. How do you feel, Lally? - I saw 10,000,000 stars. What hit me? - Well, I did, clumsy fool that I am. You're quite sure it's nothing serious? - She's all right. - I'll live 'til spring. How's Lady Bell? - [Woman] Right as rain. - [Man In Brown Jodhpurs] Have a sniffer. - No thanks, don't need it. - I do. (Lally groans) (people chattering) - Feel all right? - Fine. (Lally mumbles) Thanks dad. - Lally, do you really think you should? - Sure, I'll be okay, dad, don't worry about me. Come on, Denton, up and at 'em. - [Denton] Okay. - She's a game little kid 'eh? Not proud of her, huh? - No, not a bit. - Swim dad? - Can't, got to slog on the book. - How's it coming? - Oh fine. - Hey, what's it about this time? You've been terribly cagey about this one. Come on, loosen up. - Well, it's the story of a man about 45. Who falls in love with a... - 45, and falls in love? (Lally laughing) - Well (laughs). You youngsters, you think that life is all over at 25 or 30 huh? No more emotions, no more thrills, no more romance for the middle age. Well ol' kid let me tell you nature has changed all that. We do surge with emotions. We do have thrills and we do thirst for romance. That last romance. - You gettin' thirsty dad? - Why you young imp, I'll patter you. (people grunting) (people laughing) Oh, Lally, you're a great kid. - And say you're not a bad dad if I do say so myself. Oh is that that Cheever woman with mother? - Yes. Don't you like her? - Nope. - Why not? - Dunno, just don't, that's all. - Hello. - Hello Harriet. Oh, nice to see you here Mrs. Cheever. - Nicer to see you, Mr. Marlett. - Hello mother. - Hello dear. You know Mrs. Cheever? - Oh yes, how do you do? - Have a nice game? - Oh, dandy. Dad was in great form! Made two goals! - Oh stop. - Wonderful, how I should've liked to have been there. - Yes, Lally played like a veteran. You really had been proud of her. - I'd have been to frightened to be anything. I dislike polo. - Oh, I love it. - I get you. Big strong he-men doing their stuff, eh? - Lally! What things you say. Half the time I don't understand my own child. - Maybe it's just as well. - Oh, you're not going. - Yes, I must. - Oh (laughs). Just hurry, dear. The weather's so warm, my feet hurt. - Oh, well, put it forth, mama. There you are. - Thank you dear. - I really must go. - Oh, I'll see you to your car. - Thank you. - You'll come over soon? - Thank you, I will. - You can't come too often. - Oh can't she? - Lally, she might've heard you. - Let her. What she doing in Collingwood again? - Visiting her sister. - So why do you have her hanging around here so much for? - I like her, I think she's sweet. - Sweet, like a lemon. - Lally, I think she's wonderful. Like a girl and she must be as old as I am. She has a son older than you are. How does she do it? - Hair dye, rouge, massage, and spinach. - Now, it is not nice to criticize. I wish I were more like her. - I don't. Dad and I think you're just okay as ya are. - Aw, bless you. I wonder if I went on that 18 day diet if it would. Must you smoke? - All right. What were you and she talking about anyway, ma? - [Harriet] Her son, he. Not a very pretty attitude, Lally. - Oh mother. Well, what about her son? - His name is Doug, he's in Princeton. - Yeah? (car roaring) Looks as if our friend Mrs. Cheever were tryin' to vamp dad. - Vamp him? - Hey, what was she doing? Giving you the works? - Aw! - As if anybody could take you away from us, eh mom? Fat chance they'd have. - [Minnie] Is there anything else to go in the trunk, madam? - Here Minnie. - Why are you wantin' anything to remind ya of him? Oh, I could be hung for what I think of that Cheever woman. All the misery she's caused you this past year. (Lally whistling) - Now Minnie, don't say a word about the divorce. Lally thinks we're going away for the summer. - Well, I'm all set and rarin' to go. Got room for this? - It can go in my bag. - Oh mom. Look at her, Minnie! Can you tie that. Sozzling because she's gotta leave dad for three months. - 'Tis a sad world. Sure and it's us women that knows it. - Lally dear, I want you to ask your father to come with us. - Oh, mum, let's leave the old man at home. Just two gals on the loose. - Lally, not a nice thing to say. - No, but a swell thing to do. - [Harriet] But I'd be so much more contented if he could come with us. He'll do anything for you, dear. Won't you ask him? - What a silly old goose you are. But I'll do it. Anything to make you happy, bless you. Where is he? - There's a light in his workshop. - Hope I don't get a sock in the jaw for butting when he's writing. - Lally, put this around you dear. Not nice if someone should see you. - Well, if you ask me I think my Paris pants are quite an eyeful. (Harriet sobs) - It's all settled darling, I'll soon be free. - Then she's going to give you the divorce? - [Hal] Yes. - [Beth] Oh Hal, when can we be married? - Just as soon as. - Mother sent me to ask you to. I'll go. - No, I'll go. There are some things you'll have to hear sooner or later. So you'd better hear them now. Hal, will you see me to my car please? (footsteps tapping) - Well dad? - Well Lally I want to explain this. Lally, you've got a good head in your shoulders. I can talk straight to you. You see, Lally, men and women make promises, take on jobs when they're young, just kids. They don't stop to think of the changes that are bound to come and we, your mother and I, we didn't and today, we're not the same girl and boy that were married 23 years ago. We've outgrown each other. Sometimes when that happens between a man and his wife there comes. - A Mrs. Cheever? - Oh, now. Don't judge Mrs. Cheever too harshly. She's had a very unhappy life. So we've decided on a way out for all four of us. Mr. Cheever will go to Reno. Your mother will spend the summer in the mountains and in the autumn, get a divorce. In France, very likely. Of course I've made a settlement for her and a separate one for you. - What about our home? - We like the house, I'll keep it. You can come here. - And do you think that I'd ever come into your house after you put mother out of it and bring in your, this Cheever woman? - Lally, if you were only a boy. - If I only were. - Lally. Lally! I don't want you to think that we haven't tried to stop this thing. Both for you and her boy's sake, but we couldn't. It's too strong for us. - How long has this been going on? - About a year. And it hasn't been a happy time for us, we. - A year! Then mother was trying to kill herself. - What? - Oh what a sap I was. - Kill herself? When? - Last New Year's Eve when you went up north on that stag party. I see now. You were with. I came home New Years morning after a party, and found Minnie and Dr. Cald working over her. They said she had indigestion. I wondered why Minnie cleared out the medicine closet and suggested that I sleep in mother's room. I can understand now the look I've seen on her face. All during this past year. I suppose she's been hoping you'd snap out of this and come back to her. But instead, she's going to bundled out of doors after 23 years because you're a different man. And she's a different woman. But what makes her different? - Lally, I have explained to you. Life. - Life? I suppose you think she's a little fat, bit dowdy? Not much like the slim, slick Mrs. Cheever is she? - We'll keep Mrs. Cheever's name out of this, Lucia. - I can't leave her out since you've chosen to bring her in. - Well, we're not getting anywhere this way. Lucia, I have always said that your mother is a very fine woman. - Which means she bores you. - She has always been a good mother to you. - And a good wife to you. - But we no longer see eye to eye. We can't go on. - Don't think I'm trying to persuade you to. Don't think I'm going to pull any of that papa kiss mama stuff. If I have anything to say about it, she'll get this divorce pronto. - You blame me for it all. Is it my fault that I should meet a woman just as you, any day, any hour may meet a boy that means everything in life to you? Worth sacrificing everything for? The one makin' all the world for you? - So you've found your mate in Mrs. Cheever? - Stop right there. - Oh well. Oh dad. You didn't used to be so blind. If I could only say something, anything, to make you realize what a hideous mess you're going to make your life. - Lucia, I am letting you talk yourself out but don't try my patience too far. - I'm sorry to have talked so long. But we shan't ever talk together again, you know. Goodbye. Well, he's washed us up. Given us the air. (Harriet crying) Oh mother, haven't you any pride? - Oh, Lally. What's pride when you care for a man? When you really, really care. (water whooshing) (people chattering) - Hello goyles. - Hello Jackie. - Hello Jackie. - Hello Baby. Hello Bill. Hello! Who's the new number, huh? - Oh, that's Millie's cousin from Collingwood. - Oh. Hello Millie. - Oh, hello. - How's my little pal? - Why all the grease? I'm going to swim across the pool, not the channel. - How about giving me a knock down of the cousin? - Well, I'll have to think that over. - Now, that may take years. - Gangway! - Gangway! Hello. - Hello. - I'm Jack. - You don't say. Pleased to have met you. - Hey woman, don't high hat me! Hey, who are you? - Known to my friends as Lally. - Well, Lally what are you doing tonight? - What's it to you? - I'm that way about you. Dived right in the little old heart. - Oh, sir, please. - This little pig went to market, this little pig stayed home. - This little pig got fresh in the pool and got himself socked in the dome. (Lally gasps) - [Jack] Hey, woman! - Well! - Hey you better fall for me woman before I clout you over the head and drag you into my lair. - Oh, if you say so and what would I be doing? - Liking it. - Yeah? - Yeah. - That's for you. - Hey! Hey! (upbeat jazzy music) Excuse me. - Nerves? - Plenty and you like it. - Can stand anything. - Atta girl. Hearty spirit of the pioneer. Who are you braced against? Relax, baby, relax. (muffled singing) ♪♪ Love me and I love you ♪♪ ♪♪ Love me and I love you ♪♪ - Cut in please, Jack. - On your way, big boy, on your way. You can dance. - You don't kid. - How many fellas have told you that? - Oh, maybe the ones that danced with me. - How many is that? - Every so. - If you pucker your lips again that way, I'll. Has anyone ever kissed you? - What do you think? - Come on outside. - No. - I dare ya to. - That's different. Well? - Well. - What now? - Little devil. - My dear! Where are we going? - Over there. - Think you can make it. I'm no featherweight. - Carry ya this way the rest of my life. Romantic stuff. - Oh romantic. You're beginning to puff. Hey, the he-man, don't drop me! I've been dropped by experts. I'll give ya hand. Whoopee! - Put this around you, you might get cold. - You think I am the cold type? - I'll tell ya about that later. - Well, I make no promises. (car roaring) Hey! Let's do it again (laughs). - Well, now that the little old car's stopped, let's us begin. I don't seem to register. - If that's a sample, there's no sale. - Are you always like that? - That's just the kind of a gal I am. - Oh relax, baby, relax. What's the matter, you afraid to? - Just trembling like a dove. - Well, little dove, I'll say. - Lally! - Hello mother. - What time is it? - Only three o'clock. - Your cousins came home two hours ago. What have you been doing? - Looking at the moon. - With a man? - What else? - Well, who was he? - Who was he? - Well, I mean, what was his name, dear? - Jack, Jack. Funny, I don't know his last name. - Weren't you introduced to him? - Nope. - Where did you meet him? - Underwater. - Oh, Lally. Darling. It isn't nice to be flippant with your mother. - Oh, mother, I didn't mean to be, really. And I know it sounds funny but I forgot to ask his last name. We were too busy talking. - Lally, I've always trusted you. But I don't know now whether or not I should go on that trip tomorrow. To be gone the whole week away from you. - Oh, never worry about me, mother. Men don't mean a thing in my young life. - I hope so. You said you were not going to care for any man but now here's this Jack. Person. - Trust me, I can look after my little self. - But if you should begin to think of him seriously. - Me? Seriously? Take any man seriously? Let any man do to me what dad's done to you? Not a chance, darling. Nighty night. - Goodnight dear. - I'm to make a week. Have you heard from Doug? - Not a word. I suppose some girl has, oh, well, I mustn't be jealous. After all, it's my own fault. You know, he wanted me to go to Europe with him but there was you, Hal. And, Hal, if you want to go to Lucia. - Do you want to go to Doug? - No, no, we gave them up because we loved each other. - Oh hi, Ricky. - Hello Marlett. - Oh, I was a fool to bring you here to the club, meet all these people. - I was a fool to stay here in Collingwood after your wife had gone. All of her friends giving me the cold shoulder. Oh Hal, I've stood all I can. I wish we could go away to some quiet place where we'd be away from people like these. - Why, we can be. I know just the place. Quiet little hotel in the high Sierras. - Oh but darling, we couldn't do that. - Rent a couple of bungalows, I'll work on the book. I think it's a great idea. - But dear, you. - Now, just shut up sweetheart because that's all settled. - [Jack] Comfy, Lally? - Making no complaints. - Gee, you look ripping. - Oh, sir. Must I get up and curtesy. - Not unless you wanna rock the boat. Where are we headed for? - Up to Hunters Cove. It's my favorite hideaway. No one ever goes up there. At least no one's ever been up there with me. - Lead on to the love nest. - Lead on! - What are you whispering? - You'd laugh. - Not at you ever. What were you saying? - Peace, the path of understanding. You see, I used to be taken to church. - I'm gonna take you to church one day. - Yeah? (Jack humming) Oh you. Isn't this lovely? Come on back to the canoe, Jack. - Well, what's the rush? Come on now, you like me a little bit don't you? - I hate you like the devil. I don't think. Ouch. - Ooh, what's the matter. - Ooh, a beastly splinter under my nail. - Wait a minute, I'll get it out for ya. I've got a skinny little blade in my knife. - Oh, but you'll hurt like thunder. - You shut your pretty little eyes and trust papa. Some little surgeon, me. Didn't you know my father was an eminent doctor? - Oh really? - Sure. Dr. Cheever. Perhaps you've heard of him. - My dad's a novelist. Perhaps you've heard of him. Henry Marlett, you know. - Oh but look here. That's funny. - Yes, isn't it? - Gee, the world's a little place. You've met my mother. - She always called you Doug. - John Douglas Cheever. I never stood for Doug except from her. - That's why I never dreamed. - She always called you Lucia. - To think that we danced and play around together last night without even getting each other's names. I must've been crazy. - You fell for me like I fell for you. - You, Beth Cheever's son. And I Henry Marlett's daughter. - Does that make any real difference, Lally? - Mother and I are going to Paris in the fall. - Oh. So it's gone that far. - That far. - Poor little Lally. All broken up. - Oh stop it. I hate pity, Jack. Let's go. - Oh but Lally. - Oh Jack! What's the use! Your mother and my dad. They'd smear this for both of us. - Lally, you don't mean that this is the finish? - It has to be. - Oh Lally. - Oh Jack, don't. Please take me home. - Okay by me. - Have a cone, Lally? - [Lally] No thanks. - I'll take one. - What's the matter, lose your appetite? - No, she just mislaid the boyfriend. ♪♪ First she wants Jack and then wants you ♪♪ ♪♪ Then she goes back to good old Tim ♪♪ ♪♪ My oh my who could satisfy ♪♪ ♪♪ She's got the boyfriend blues ♪♪ ♪♪ She can't be true to anyone ♪♪ ♪♪ All she's out for is lots of fun ♪♪ ♪♪ My oh my who could satisfy ♪♪ ♪♪ She's got the boyfriend blues ♪♪ ♪♪ What a girlfriend, oh what love ♪♪ ♪♪ Just made for all the boys ♪♪ ♪♪ Oh but sometimes she gets rough ♪♪ ♪♪ She plays with them like toys ♪♪ ♪♪ She has no phone and no address ♪♪ ♪♪ When she cleans 'em, they sure stay pressed ♪♪ ♪♪ My oh my who could satisfy ♪♪ ♪♪ She's got the boyfriend blues ♪♪ - That's great!

No. Say, that strong arm stuff may slay your other lady friends but it doesn't hit with me. Say, what's this marathon for? A medal or a silver cup? - Sit there you and listen to me. - Well. Hey! What is this? Catcher's catch can to save my honor or what have you? - You shut up and listen to me. - Well, make it snappy. - If I weren't nuts about you, I'd just naturally lay you over my knee and frail you. - You great big brute! - Oh cut the comedy, you think you can kid me along then give me the air for three days and get away with it? Haven't you any heart at all? - Something's beating. - It's just a big muscle that pumps your blood. - The kid's there with anatomy stuff all right. - Oh Lally be serious. Why do you try to bluff me? You know I love you and you love me, oh yes you do. Say you'll marry me, Lally, say it. - I'll never marry any man in the world. Least of all you. Have one? Must I be known to smoke alone? - What have you got against me except that your father and my mother and what's that got to do with us? - Plenty! - But Lally, I. - Oh Jack, there's nothing more to say on that subject. We were crazy to dream. - You're crazy now. - Oh cut it out. - Lally, you love me. - Well, what if I do. - Then marry me. - I can't Jack, I can't! - But why not? - You know why not. - Oh so you're gonna crucify us because of my mother. Well if you were half the woman that she is, we could be happy. - Happy? If I were like your mother? - Yes, when she loves a man, she's willing to cash in for him, let herself go. - Well, there's my mother. What about her? Do you think I'll do to her what my father's done? Well I won't and that's final. - And you'll marry me or I'll leave you flat and that's final. - All right by me, fella, all right by me. (people chattering) - [Jack] Lally! - Oh Jack! (phone rings) - [Woman] Oh hello Jacky. - Hello. (upbeat music) Hello little girl. Why Lally what's the matter? - I was expecting to hear from you all day. Where've you been? - Why darling, you didn't? You haven't been worrying? Well, I love you more than ever. If you don't believe it, look. - Oh Jacky, you didn't have to do that. - I love you. You'll marry me, you'll marry me now. Here, put it on, lovely. - No, you put it on. - Like it? I like this one better. - A wedding ring? - When you put that one, I know you belong to me for keeps. You want to belong to me, don't you Lally? - Oh I sure do. - Then let's get married tonight. - Tonight? Oh no, Jacky, not tonight. Well, we can't. - Why, sure we can. - No we can't, no we can't. - Oh yes we can, hop in the little old bus, dash across the state line and the old bird who does the marrying is in the first house we come to. Well, we can be married. - Oh no, but listen. - No, I'm not gonna let you say no. - I know but Jacky. - Oh now don't be a Jenny mule, juts do as papa says. Marry me tonight? - Okay. I'll be ready in a minute. - You can get a toothbrush at the corner drugstore. - But not a coat and hat, at least not yet. Mother! What brought you home? - Your aunt telegraphed for me. - Oh I see, mother this is. - [Harriet] I know. Beth Cheever's son. - Mother, I love him. And I'm going to marry him. - Lally, I want you to come to my room. - Oh Jack, her hurt eyes. It was just like stabbing her. - Steady, little girl. You've got to expect that. You won't quit on me now. You won't let her talk you over. You've promised to marry me, hang onto that. How 'bout it, little old kid, are you gonna stick? - I'll stick. - Tonight, without saying a word to me? Oh darling that you could think of doing such a thing. - Oh mother, I didn't want to but he showed me it was the only way. He told me you'd do just what you're doing now. - Just like a son of hers to scheme. - Mother, that isn't fair. - But Lally, it's your whole future, your happiness. - That's just it, that's what I've a right to! My happiness. - You can't be happy. You won't be happy. Her son. - Oh that doesn't matter! - He won't give up his mother for you! - I wouldn't ask that of any man. - Oh Lally, you'll be seeing her. She'll be your father's wife. What a situation for you, dear. You hadn't thought of that, had you? But you must think of it. Give yourself time to think of it. Oh baby girl, don't marry him tomorrow, promise me. - Oh mother, I won't promise, I won't! - Then you're going to sacrifice me and my love for this. - Can I help it if I've met somebody who's everything in life to me. Worth sacrificing everything for? The one mate in all the world for me? - Oh that woman. First your father. Then you. Darling, if you think you're going to find happiness with this boy, I won't come between you. I'll say no more about it. - Oh mother! That's that. (glass clatters) Mother, open the door, please. Do you want to frighten me to death? Mother, open the door! Aunt Caroline, Aunt Caroline, help, come quickly! Uncle Nate, Uncle Nate, come up, help, help, quickly! Mother, mother don't ya hear me? Open the door! Mother! Oh, don't let her do it Aunt Caroline. Don't let her. - Oh Lally, stop screaming. What is it? - Don't let mother, in there, I'm afraid she's. - [Uncle Nate] What is it? - Uncle Nate, mother's in there. Make her open the door, please! - Yes, hurry father! - Open the door. - Hurry! - Mother, mother! Tell me you didn't. Tell me you just didn't. - Oh Lally stop, Harriet, what is this? - Look, tell me you didn't, mother? Oh dear. - Lally. - Yes mother. - Lally, I fainted, the heat. - And the shock. - Nate, telephone the doctor. - Oh yes my dear. - Suzy, the smelling salts. - [Suzy] Yes mother. - Lally. - Yes dear. - Oh dear, you didn't think, did you that I'd tried to? Oh my poor little girl. Didn't mean to scare you darling. - No, dear. No dear. Oh doctor, is mother better this morning? - Slightly. - Is there any? - No real danger. She's had a shock. - Yes, I know. May I go to her? - Certainly. - [Caroline] Oh doctor. - [Doctor] Yes Mrs. Elrick? - [Caroline] Are there any special instructions? - [Doctor] She must be kept perfectly quiet. Her heart, you know? (people chattering) - Hello Gertrude, have a nice ride? - I hope the horse enjoyed it. - Quite nice sir, 59. - Victoria, any phone messages for me? - [Victoria] No, not a thing. - Oh, there's a letter here for you Mr. Cheever. - Good, thanks. - Here you are. How you feeling? - Fitter than fit. - Well I'm glad to hear that. Thank you. - [Woman] Hello Ethel. - [Ethel] Hello, what are you doing this afternoon? - [Woman] Nothing serious. - [Ethel] Would you like to play bridge? - [Woman] I wouldn't mind. - [Ethel] Well, there's Marie and Alice. (people chattering) Really, how dull! - Gimme that same number I called a few minutes ago, will you? Well, you oughta, I've called it often enough. Yes, that's the one. - Jack, I won't see you. I can't see you. I don't dare! - Be fair to me, Lally. Be a good, come on, let me see ya just for a minute. - Oh no Jack, don't come here. Oh no, I couldn't stand that, Jack. No, no, Jacky, this is goodbye. Jacky? Goodbye. (gong ringing) - Lally. - Yes mother? - Was that three o'clock? - Yes dear. Let me fluff your pillows up for you. - Terribly hot, isn't it? - That feel better? - Yes, if we only had a storm to clear the air. - Go to sleep woman, count the baa lambs and you'll drop off again. - Oh it's so nice to have you beside me. Blessed baby girl. - Now go to sleep. - I was willing you to come to me and you have so it's all right but don't send me away again because I won't go. - Send you away? Do you think I want to send you away, Jacky? - I've got the little old canoe down at the landing. Let me run you over to the little ol' love nest. - Oh but mother. - She won't wake up for hours. Let's spend them together. Lally, please. (wind whooshing) - Oh, Lally did you? - Come on, Jacky. - Wonder if we can make it little ol' kid. - Oh we must. - Risky, storms pick up on this little old lake. - Oh Jacky, we must, we've gotta get home. Mother may wake up and she'll be frantic. We've gotta make it Jacky, come on. - Okay by me. - Oh where can she be? - Harriet, don't forget what the doctor said. You must be quiet. Now, you go to bed. - Lally's not here, Jack's not at the hotel. - Oh what can I say to poor Harriet? - Jacky, Jacky, Jacky! Jacky! - Lally, Lally! - Jack, Jack where are you? - Lally? Lally! - Jack! Jacky, Jacky, Jack! - Hello, hello? It's my home. Tell the Collingwood operator. What? Don't answer? There must be someone there. No, no, no, no, no, don't cut off central. Keep on ringing. Fools. - Oh, Hal, don't shout so. It makes my head ache. - Sorry. - Well, you should be. What a day I've had with you dear. Well, it's living with something caged. Oh, it's all so ridiculous darling. Just because you've had a dream. - You wouldn't understand. There's something wrong and I know it. I've always known ever since she was a little girl. Hello, hello? Oh, is that you Minnie? - Oh, Mr. Marlett. Lally was. - Wire Mrs. Marlett that I'm coming at once. - Hal, what it is? What is it? - Drowned, Lally. This morning. Your boy. - My Doug? - She was calling to me. Lally, my little Lally. - My boy, what about my boy, do you hear me? - Drowned. - Drowned. (airplane engine roaring) - Nothing to do now but dredge. I hear tell dynamite's better. (woman screaming) - No, no, no, no, no! Caroline, my baby, my Lally, my little girl! (women wailing) - Where's Mrs. Marlett. - In there, sir. - Thanks. (airplane engine rumbling) - Jacky! Jacky, Jacky! God, God save him, save him God. Don't punish us, don't. Save him. (airplane engine roaring) Hush Jacky, hush. Like a church. I'm going to church with you one day. You pray in a church, don't you? Our Father who art in heaven. Jesus, lover of my soul, let me to Thy bosom fly, while the nearer waters roll. Water, the water, the water! Jack, Jack, where are you? Oh, oh, oh my darling. (airplane engine roaring) - Lally! Lally! - Don't touch him, don't touch him! - Lally, it's dad. Lally, Lally dear. - Jack, no, Jack! - Lally, Lally, it's dad. - No. I called my dad. - I heard you, I heard you Lally. I'm here. - I want my dad, I want my dad. - Lally, I'm here. - Oh, oh! Oh dad! - [Hal] Lally. - Harriet, he recognized her. - It wasn't a shock? - No, no, no, he came to quite clear headed. - Where is Lally? - Up there now, talking to him. - But Lally. - Now, now, now, every little thing's just okay. Lookie. Soon as I could stagger, I went through your pockets. Getting in training. - Little devil. - Put it on. Hey! - Oh, get off me woman, you weigh a ton! - Liar. - Did ya get it? - A diamond? Trust mama. (Lally laughing) (dramatic music)
