To a little town with a little church ? Where they ain't afraid to preach the word ? 'Cause it's the simple things in my life ? Like my baby's homemade apple pie ? And it's a porch swing swinging, sipping sweet tea ? Hot sun setting down, her kissing on me ? I love you, baby And I thank you, Lord, at night ? 'Cause it's my kind of life ? Yeah ? It's my kind of life ? Well, my daddy always told me ? Don't knock it till you've tried it ? But I can say firsthand the big city ain't for me ? 'Cause all I need is my woman's love ? A piece of land and a dog that hunts of off country road ? That winds and runs for miles and miles ? To a little town with a little church ? Where they ain't afraid to preach the word ? 'Cause it's the simple things in my life ? Like my baby's homemade apple pie ? And it's a porch swing swinging, sipping sweet tea ? Hot sun setting down, her kissing on me ? I love you, baby And I thank you, Lord, at night ? And it's my kind of life ? It's my kind of life ? Yeah ? It's my kind of life Open. I think I love it. You think you love it or you love it? I love it, a lot! Thanks, Mom. Happy birthday. Now go thank your dad, he picked the color. Thanks! Come here. Happy birthday. I'm glad you like it, your mom picked out the color. I just nodded. Thank God you're not a boy. Let's go for a ride. Hop on. If you're gonna wear that thing you best start breaking it in. My dad used to say that a man, or in your case, a beautiful young woman, doesn't choose the hat, the hat chooses him or her. They say your hat defines just what kind of a person who wears it. I guess that makes you a purple person... Whatever that means. Here comes trouble. Donald. Howdy, Jack. Rita. Hey. Just in time to help me rip some railings. The old Tom Sawyer ploy. No, sir, I am too smart to be tricked into hard work by you or Mark Twain. Sweet tea? My favorite. That sure makes the drive out here worthwhile. But I'm feeling a little disappointed because I've been here all of a minute and Jack here hasn't invited me to go duck hunting with him yet. How can we do that, Donald? You shot them all last year. That I did. Thank you, darling. What do you think? Purple... Ah! Real pretty. When I get my iPhone I'm gonna get a cover that matches it. Megan, go grab some apples and fresh milk for Donald. Well, uh... Me being the new president of Chaney Bank, I guess you both know what this visit's about. Oh, darn it, Jack, Rita... This is hard for me. Ever since Brett Chaney bought the bank... Well, you know how he likes to throw his weight around. I'm still trying to get my head around someone buying a bank. Like father like son. My dad never had much time for old man Chaney. It's a changing world, Jack, not always for the better. Well, young Brett's cleaning house over at the bank and he's crackin' down hard on tardy debt. Now you've missed... We know. Three payments. That puts you $11,100 behind. That's a big number. If we could just have a little more time, we could... Ninety days in arrears is their limit, Rita. Another missed month and Chaney will foreclose on you. What'd I miss? Now I'm sure you've heard that Brett Chaney is the new owner of the bank, gonna bring some of that, uh, east coast, big city financial learning to our once quiet community. Just what we need. Well, he says that his roots are here. Calls it giving back. He's talking big changes, and poor Donald Dubree has become his foot soldier. Ooh, they're probably talking about us. Hmm. You know, I actually think they're talking about their son Ross who happens to be chatting up your lovely daughter over there. How are things at the farm? It's a small town, Pastor, it's no secret we're struggling. Yeah, milk prices are down and water, fertilizer, fuel are all sky high, so... Well, things will turn around, you just keep the faith. If Dad were alive he'd know what to do. He'd stop all this farming and milking, get back to horse ranching. Well, that'd be great if it made any economic sense. Horses are for hobby, not for business. I keep telling Jack we need a smarter crop, we need a high dollar crop that makes good use of our land instead of growing alfalfa to feed livestock. This is not the place to be airing our... Well I, I didn't mean to rock the ark, so to speak. I was just... It's okay. Listen, you two have a fine day and don't you be too tough on him. - Ugh. Mom, Dad, this is Ross. Hi, Mrs. Shephard. Uh... I've got something for you, Mr. Shephard. I'm sure you've heard my dad is sponsoring a big horse race. Somebody's gonna win big, if you've got a fast horse it could be worth your while. Hello... Uh, Belinda Chaney, I don't believe we've met. Not officially but I've seen you at the feed store. Oh... Right, right. You're the people who milk cows, right? We're one of the suppliers for Milner Dairy. Oh... We gave up dairy years ago. We are soy all the way now. Brett Chaney and uh, you are? Jack Shephard. This is my wife Rita, our daughter Megan. Hi. I see you've got one of our flyers. We're just getting started. I'm gonna make this race big, turn it into a yearly event, put our little hometown on the map. Mmm. Milner could use a makeover, right? Put a little lipstick on the pig, so to speak. I don't know... I kinda like Milner the way it is. We're uh... A little old fashioned. Well, we're here to bring some, uh, new fashion, boost the town's bottom line. Mmm-hmm. What are all those doing in your hands still, Ross? Your job was to hand them out. All of them. I'll call you? Oh... Well... My phone... Got turned off. It's just temporary, darling, until things get better. If there's any of those left in your hand by the time we get to the Escalade, you're walking home. You folks have a nice day. Bye. I think that Chaney boy is head over heels for you. What are you drawing? Our field, I'm figuring out row count and plant spacing. I have an idea. About what? About an alternative crop, I've been studying up on it. What crop? Wheat grass and there is good money in it. Wheat grass? Mmm-hmm. Wheat is a grass, help me out here. No, this is different. Trust me I think this might be our answer. Cows seem satisfied, horses before them. Well, wheat grass, for your information, is not for cows it's for people. It produces a rich, delicious nectar that is rich in antioxidants, it's healthy... Where are you going? Clear my head. Go, go! Go! Oh... Come on, boy. Good thing you don't have other horses here, she's coming out of her most fertile cycle now. Good lure for a wild stallion. Oh, whoa... Careful, my friend. You may catch this apparition but it's a good way to get hurt if you ask me. Or killed. Mom, don't say that! That animal outran my horse and Chester's the fastest we've got. Can you talk some sense into him? He wants to enter that horse in Chaney's big race. Race? Don't push your luck, Jack. Megan, bye-bye. Bye, Dr. Owens. Rita... AJ. Jack... Bye. This is no ordinary horse. He's wild. One of a kind. I know the type, that's what scares me the most. Now if the wind will just blow her scent in his direction... We got him. He's ours. Good morning, girl. Hey... Here. What's wrong, girl? Mom, Dad! Are you all right? Did he kick you? Look at me! Are you all right? He didn't kick me. It says here that wheat grass is a high yield plant that does well in our climate and it's 60-day grow cycle. That's a quick turnover, Jack. Oh, and our timing is perfect, plants go in early May. This is a sorry excuse for a dinner. Family needs a proper meal, a hot meal. Family needs a home, I'm trying to keep ours. By growing something we know nothing about? I know plenty about it. I have been researching this and I have thought it through. Please, just listen with an open mind. Okay? So here's our situation. We're $11,000 behind on three months of missed mortgage payments but if we can pay up just one month, that'll buy us an extra 30 days. Donald says that the bank, they won't foreclose unless we're over 90 days in arrears. Follow me? I've done a budget for the initial cost of wheat grass cultivation and we could, we could till the front pasture, we could get a starter crop going for just $9,000. Nine thousand dollars? And plow our feed crop under? You're talking crazy here, Rita. Where are we gonna get that kind of money? Well, we talk to Donald and we ask for a bank loan. I mean, not against the land and the buildings, that's all been mortgaged out. But against everything else. Vehicles and the equipment, it'll be right down to our furnishings and our life insurance policy. There. What's this? This is a loan proposal that I made up for Donald, it lists all of our assets and their value. If the bank will give us $9,000 and we sell the Holsteins... Sell our stock? We could pay off one month of mortgage, we could plant the grass and still have $4,300 left over for food and living expenses to carry us through until harvest. Sixty days from planting to harvest... That's still two more missed mortgage payments. That's right. But if the crop looks healthy... Well, Tristate Co-op, they said they'd give us half in advance of harvest. The health food stores, they can't get enough of this stuff. With what we already owe that'd put us almost $30,000 in debt with the bank. That's the riskiest plan I can imagine. I know you disapprove and I know that your father probably would've disapproved. This is a long way from horse ranching. You got that right. But I also know this, he would not want us to lose everything he had worked so hard to build up. Let's do this to honor him. Just until we get back on our feet. Okay. I'm willing to stand behind you on this, Rita, if Donald will agree to give us the loan. All right. A toast. Oh, Mom, this is gross! You gotta be kidding me. People actually drink this stuff? Yes... And they will gladly pay $3 a shot. Three dollars? For a cup this big? Yeah. We just have to deliver the grass and then our job is over. The health food stores, they juice it right on the spot. Another shot? No! I wouldn't want to deprive some health nut of his daily dose of antitoxic soylent green or whatever it is. Antitoxin, not antitoxic. Three dollars a swallow? - Mmm-hmm. Hit me again. I love you. Roll me in dirty diapers! Three dollars? For that much? Dag nab it, I'm in the wrong business. Oh! This wasn't easy, I went to the wire on this Jack... And uh, Brett, uh... The bank is willing to give you $9,000 loan on your collateral. You got Belinda to thank for pushing this over the top. What... Belinda Chaney? Had to listen to the virtues of this stuff and other unpronounceable health things for almost an hour. She asked me if I wanted to try spelt flour, I said "F-L-O-U-R". I thought I got it right. Yeah. You know, with all the hype, I'm... I'm just a little surprised at the taste. Tell me about it. I'll grow it but I'll leave the drinking to someone with money to burn. You're selling the milk cows? If what Rita's found out is true... And I trust her judgment on this one. I don't want to question your good judgment, but right now it's a field crop. What if it freezes? What about insects, birds... What if the health market softens? Health does not go out of style. We know the risks. Another shot? No, thank you, ma'am. You're pledging the whole ball o' wax on this one. Now, I just don't see a back door out for you on this. If... If this doesn't pan out, you'll lose it all. Give me that pen. All right then, well, let's get these loan documents signed. Tell me, Jack, am I looking green? 'Cause I'm feeling green. Hey! Easy, boy. Apple? Well, come and get 'em, silly. Until we meet again... Midnight. That's your name now. Midnight. Come on! It's okay, he's cool. Come on now, Midnight. It's just an apple. You've gotta trust me. I need another apple. Did you see that? Oh, my whole body is shaking. You are not the only one. Hold on. I wanna get a shot of you and him. Smile. A flash? Really? Unbelievable. Sorry. Really. He let me touch him! It was incredible. Who? What are you talking about? The stallion, I petted his mane! Take me there. Now? Yes, now. What are you gonna do? Gonna catch me a stallion if I can. Grab some oats while I saddle up. Better take them back, darling. I gotta help your mom. Well, it's time to take a well-deserved breather. Sit back and feel proud of all that we've accomplished. Yeah, we successfully planted an entire field of grass that tastes so bad even a cow won't eat it. Right. Can you believe how happy your father looked when that last plant went in the ground? Ecstatic. And where were you this morning? Just riding. Mmm-hmm. And how is Ross? Dad... Stop it. We saw Dad's stallion. Well, now that Old MacDonald's done with all his farming, how about showing me the last place you saw our stallion. His name is Midnight. I named him. I've got a pretty good idea of where he hangs out. Take me there. I'm standing by your plan but that doesn't mean I have to give up on mine. It's gonna be dark in an hour. Well, then, first thing in the morning. There he is! Let's get closer. Easy now, this is a wild horse and we're on his turf. Wow! Midnight. Midnight. You're not gonna try and lasso him, are you? No, not yet. Not out here. He likes apples. All horses like apples. What are you gonna do? Listen to him. Listen to him? He'll tell us what we ought to do. I could show you how he lets me touch him. No. Don't take that lightly, he's dangerous. He's wild, he's free... And he's fast. He wants to play, look at him! Feel what he's saying to you. "Okay, all right, sure I wanna see how fast you really are." And you heard him say that? Clear as day. I'm listening, Midnight. Yee-haw! Yee-haw! Ya! You think we could catch him? He's like a rocket! Yah! He's gonna make one heck of a race horse. If anyone can ever catch him. Until we meet again, Midnight! Dad, I... I hardly think he's gonna understand that. What... What did he say? Not sure. It sounded like "See ya again." And then something about that purple thing on your hat. What does that book say about flash floods? Alfalfa's hearty, it can take bad weather. I don't know about this wheat grass stuff. This crop won't survive. I am so sorry, Jack, for pushing you into this. Freak weather's nobody's fault, it's the peril of farming. Why can't something go our way in life? I mean, why does everything have to be so hard? We'll pull through this. We're not down yet, not by a long shot. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Yeah. Hey, big guy. Remember me? We talked yesterday. I'm Jack. I'm just here to hang out with you, I'll just let you come to me. I'm not even here. Nope, not me. See, I'm not even looking at you. Might not even be talking to you. You don't have to be afraid of me. So what do you say you come and meet me here. His name's Midnight, Dad. Stay where you are, he knows me better. What'd I tell you about this? You said listen. Yeah. So listen. Hello, Midnight, I missed you. That's my dad. Hey. I wanna try and ride him. No, I don't think this tornado's ready to ride yet. Then at least come and meet him. That's what I've been trying to do. Yeah, he's beautiful. And I think he likes you! Yeah, I think he does. Let's see how much he likes both of us. We've built enough good trust for today, it's time we leave. I'm pretty sure Midnight's got a busy schedule. Schedule, Dad? Really? I think that's a pretty big word for a horse. He's following us! Don't look back. Say something to him. About his schedule? Oh, about anything. It's not so much what you say, it's how you say it. Quick, say something else. You say something. You started it! I don't wanna fight about it... Give him the wrong idea. You're weird. You can say anything you want, just make it sound good. You go first. Tell him a joke. Okay... Uh, this horse goes into a grocery store... Not that one, Dad! That's why he left. You think it's something we said? I think it was that old joke. Yeah. Wow! He probably heard my sweet voice. Or maybe his schedule opened up. Easy, boy. You're home now. I know you're hungry. How about some oats? Wow. You don't waste any time, do you? Nope. It's my turn to have a go at getting us out of this mess. You sound just like your dad. Only he let 'em beat him. Jack, whatever you do at this point, I'm right there with you. No one's gonna beat us. Me too, Dad. Nobody can beat Midnight. I'm gonna race him, Rita, and I'm gonna win. Can you break and train this stallion in time? I mean, that race is less than two weeks away. Mom's right, Dad. You haven't even got a saddle on him yet. Well, that's why they invented tomorrow. Is that a steak dinner I smell? Very funny. No, it's blue box night, deluxe. With tuna and peas. Where's Megan? Two guesses. Neither include Ross this time. She's with Midnight. That horse scares me, Jack. Relax, she's probably trying to break the Guinness Record on how many apples a horse can eat. Hey, Midnight. Here's an apple for you. Yeah. Easy, Midnight. We can do this. What are you thinking? He's not ready for this, he's still wild! You gotta take it slow. You can't expect him to just let you ride him. You scared him. What about her? What about our daughter? I will have no more of her on that horse, I mean it! She could've been hurt or paralyzed! Mom, I'm fine. Nothing's wrong. Not a word! It's not his fault! I shouldn't have tried to ride him. Shh! Easy boy. I guess now's a good a time as any. My daddy used to say when you get dumped off a horse, you get back on. Whoa! Jack! Jack! Dad, are you okay? Yeah, yeah. What'd he say? He said he'd rather do it tomorrow. Easy, Midnight, let's just walk around and get used to each other. That's it, just follow me. What's he doing? It's called horse whispering. Like the dog whisperer on TV? Shh! Watch. What's that prize money looking like? Weird... Ross? I thought you were talking to him, sorry. Uh, $20,000, as of this morning, Mr. Shephard. $40,000 after Dad matches it. $40,000. You hear that, Midnight? That would buy a lot of oats. Whoa, whoa, hey... There's no way you're getting back on that thing. You're gonna break a leg. Maybe it's too soon. Okay. Off, off the fence! Whoa! Easy, easy. Easy, easy. Yes, good boy. Thanks for the ride and for the looks on those faces. Thanks, Teddy. Oh, you know we need two bags, right? Yeah, I know Mrs. Shephard. The manager wouldn't let me bring the other one because he says you're charged to the max this month. Sorry. Oh, right. Yeah. No, we're gonna get that paid up. Bye! You have to close your eyes. Why, what is it? Well, if I tell you it won't be a surprise. Okay, but it better not be a trick or something. It's not a trick. What are you doing? Just keep them closed. I am! Okay, almost time. All right. Oh, I've heard this song before. I really like it, thanks! Oh, not the song... The player. I'm giving it to you. No, I can't. I can't, it's too expensive. No, don't think about the money. It's a gift. No, Ross. Really, I can't. I can't. Do you wanna hang out this afternoon? Sure. There you are, Ross! I've been looking all over for you. We're running late. Uh, late for what? I thought you said that I could get a ride home with Dad. Those plans changed. Come on. Hi, Megan. Hey, Mrs. Chaney. Ross. Hi. Hi, Mrs. Shephard. How are you? He's fine and we're late. Come here. I like you and you like me and we both wanna do this together. So don't put me back in the dirt, okay? Is that a deal? You talk to him like he understands every word you're saying. Ah, I don't know if he understands every word that I'm saying but I think he knows what I mean. Connect with him, Dad. He's gotta feel like you're a part of him, like a team. We are sort of a team. He's the punter and I'm the football. We're better than a team, we're like one. Talk to him. He likes it when you do that. I like it when you do that. Oh, I'm so sorry, Dad! Oh, it's okay. Midnight loves apples. Is a check all right? I'm going to have to call this in. Hi, Mr. Shephard. Hey, Ross, behind the lines today. Yeah, Dad hired me to help out with the race. Hey, Mr. Shephard... Um... It's great that you're entering Midnight into the race but 350 bucks is a lot of money and, you know, it's not refundable. Lately, Ross, my whole life seems to be non-refundable. You know, hold on! Before you do that... What was that about? Who'd you call? My dad. I tried to get him to give you a break on the entry fee, but he said if he did that for you, he'd have to do it for everyone. I wish you hadn't done that, Ross. I'm no charity case. We good here or not? Yes, sir, Mr. Shephard. We'll take those flowers, too. You'll have to pay for those inside. You spent a lot of money we need for food and living by entering that race. I heard talk about the prize money being over $50,000. And I read in the paper about all the professionally trained horses that are gonna be in this race. Have you even considered the odds stacked against you actually winning? With that kinda money we might even get this place back to being a horse ranching operation again. Are you hearing a single word I am saying or are you still dreaming? I hear you. What's wrong with dreaming? Nothing's wrong with it, it just scares me, that's all. 'Cause I don't have a better solution anymore. Guess I'm the one who's lost. Well, Midnight's gonna help you find your way home. I gotta go, just close it! What is this? Jack Shephard actually entered a horse in my race? What do these yokels think I'm running? There's gonna be some serious horse flesh here. Not just any horse, Dad, it's an amazing horse. Did he pay the full fee? Yeah, I took the money myself. Guy's up to his neck in debt, he's got no business wasting my money like this. Do you know how silly you sound? Your money. He thinks he can win. On what, one of his farm animals? No, Midnight is no farm animal. Oh, no, not just a "horse" this Midnight. He's wild and powerful and beautiful too. Power and beauty will not win a race. I've seen him run, nothing can catch him. Come on, how fast can he be? Well, he's the fastest horse I've ever seen. And smart too. He listens to Mr. Shephard. What do you mean he listens? He... He horse whispers him. Broke him in without a whip or anything. Spare the rod... Doesn't work on horses, and it doesn't work on people. You're proof of that. Yeah. You don't know where he trains, do you? Donald called. Brett Chaney got wind of our crop failure and wants Donald to start drawing up the foreclosure papers. You gotta have a little faith, baby. In me and in Midnight. We can win this thing, I know it. Right... Maybe I should just go out and buy a winning lottery ticket, or maybe a meteor will crash down in the middle of our field. You know, I hear they're more valuable than gold lately. Rita, please, I'm working with what I got here. What we've got here. Midnight won't let us down. I'm sorry, I just... I feel helpless. I want a future for Megan where this doesn't happen, she deserves that. Hey, I want that too. I'll make it right, I promise. It's not like we're betting our whole lives on a horse race here. Not funny. You're right. Not funny. I'm just trying to lighten things up a little. Everything's gonna be okay. I promise. I know it's hard, maybe even impossible but try to look at it as an opportunity. And when opportunity knocks... Afternoon, Jack. Afternoon. What brings you here? My boy tells me that you talk to horses, and crazier than that, they listen. My father taught me. Yeah, my father was a horseman too... He taught me the only things horses understand are power and fear. Your power and the horses' fear. That's not how I train. You look worried, Jack. Seeing me at your door, with what you owe me... We're working on that mortgage, but we need time. Well, that's why I'm here. I want to sell you a six-month extension, give you time to get back on your feet so maybe you can keep this place. Six months would be a lifesaver. But how can I buy an extension when I can't even make the mortgage? I don't want money, I just want that stallion I see down in your coral, uh, Midnight. My boy, he's been around horses his whole life and he says he has never seen a faster one. You give me that stallion and I'll give you a year. Now that's more than the winnings and I'll even refund your entry fee. All this for Midnight? Why? Why do you think, Jack? To race him. With some strong-arm whip training and an aggressive jockey, a horse like that has the potential to go all the way. Nationals, Preakness, Kentucky Derby! There I go again. Belinda is always on me for dreaming too big, and saying too much and giving away my advantage. You know, that's... I can't help it. Well... What do you say? I don't know. Can you give me a little time to consider this? All you want. How about an hour? Gotta close on some real estate down the road, old man Billers. Finally bought the farm. Or should I say, he sold it. I'll stop by on my way back. You give me the word and I'll have my people draw up those extension papers. It's as simple as that. You can't do it, Dad. He'll beat Midnight, you know he will! He said so. Midnight is just as much my horse as he is yours, I won't let you. First, that horse doesn't belong to any of us. He belongs out there. His name is Midnight, not that horse. He cares about us as much as we care about him, you know that. You feel it! At least I thought you did. I thought you were better than Chaney. I guess I was wrong. Oh, Midnight... Buddy, I just don't know what to do anymore. I really need your help here. You know I don't wanna do it but I may not have a choice. You've already made your choice. You're going to ride Midnight in the race. Our life and future are on the line. Your future. What about Midnight's life and future? That's important too. Not as important as our home and family. So I give you a lifeline and you turn me down? I thought this property meant something to you, Jack. Your dad's ranch and all... It's only a horse we're talking about. No, it's a special horse with spirit and speed like I've never seen in any animal before. I've decided to keep him and ride him in your race. All right. Well, then here's one for you... I'll make you a bet. I'll forgive your house debt, mortgage and all if you ride your horse in my race and win. Hey, I'll even let you keep the prize money. But if you lose, I get everything. House, property... If I lose you get everything anyway. Where's the catch? I said everything, Jack, including Midnight. Do it, Dad! Midnight won't let you down. Unless that horse isn't as fast as you say. Well, I guess we'll find out. What are you doing? Looking for a four-leaf clover. Why? I wanna make a wish. Forget it. I already made one. Well, it doesn't get much better than this. You're right, except for one thing. Riding Midnight across that finish line. Mmm. And I believe you will. You know, Megan stands behind you and I do too. Can you believe that little spitfire? Passion in her heart for that horse. How are you gonna feel when she has that passion in her eyes for Ross? I can't stay out too late. I know. Remember when we were like that? I don't have to remember. You were so shy. Gosh, I love that about you. Always coming up with these silly reasons to touch me. Remember? Like telling you there was a bee on your head just so I could run my fingers through your hair? Mmm... Remember our first kiss? I remember you chickening out. You didn't hold back. I knew what I wanted. Hey! Can I help you? Uh, hi... Mort. Mort Gridley Real Estate. Nobody tell you I was coming? No. Coming for what? Getting the property ready to market. Brett Chaney gave me the listing but... I, uh... Hey, I didn't mean to intrude. I thought you knew. Property's not for sale, not yet anyway. All right, I was just gonna take a few pictures but I can see this isn't a good time. So, um... You folks have yourselves a nice day, all right. Well, my friend, I may have really done it this time. No pressure. I just want you to know it's all on the line, all of it. Everything I love in life... Rita, Megan, my daddy's ranch, the whole shebang. And a whole lot more. Anyway, you know what they say about putting all your eggs in one basket... Midnight's smart but I don't think he gets analogies yet. He does. If Midnight could talk, he'd tell you how proud he is of you. Just like Mom and I. He won't let you down, Dad. It's not him I'm worried about. I'm the one who got us into this mess and now I'm talking to a horse, asking him to get me out of it. You go inside and give your mom a hand. I'll be there before she flips her bacon. Mom! Mom! Dad's hurt! Hurry! Dad... I can't lift it! I can't breathe. Get your mom. Mom, it's too heavy! Oh, no! Jack! Jack, I'm here. I'm here! Use Midnight. Get a rope! Do it! Good girl. Okay, Jack, just hang on! Pull! Pull, Midnight! Pull! Pull, Midnight! Pull! Oh, my God. I thought I lost you, Jack. No, I got more important things to do than dying. But you might've lost that bacon. Go. You need a real doctor, Jack. You got at least three cracked ribs and the hairline fracture to your wrist, it could get worse. You are a real doctor, AJ, and a friend. Besides, a real doctor doesn't give you a sugar cube when he's done. Easy. I just can't have Chaney finding out about this before I've figured out what to do. What to do? Well, you have to tell him you can't do the race, he'll understand, in your condition. He's not... He'll take it all, Rita. I sort of bet the farm. Yeah, yeah, I heard. Look, Rita's right, your family needs you in one piece. Then I'll ride Midnight. No, it's too dangerous. I won't allow it. So you're just going to give up? Let Chaney take it all? You're gonna give him Midnight? I said no. I hope you have a plan. I gotta talk it over with Midnight, he'll know what to do. Talk it over? What, with the horse? Sounds like you're gonna need more than a regular doctor. I never should've brought you here in the first place. Using you in this crazy scheme, thinking you were some easy ticket out of this mess, that's done nothing but put my family in a place that's up to me to find a way out of. And I can only do that, thanks to you. I owe you my life, Midnight... And I've come to return the favor. It's okay, it's okay. Midnight! I know you can hear me. I need your help. I know what my dad did was the right thing. And... I would never do anything to hurt you in any way. But... I really need you right now. Midnight... Midnight, you heard me. You really heard me, didn't you? Well, listen up, 'cause I'm not done yet... Sit. Did you take your pills? They were like horse pills. They were horse pills. Where's Megs? Mmm. She's out by the barn. You could've let her say goodbye. I didn't plan it, I just did it. Seemed like the only thing to do considering the alternatives. Hard enough as it was, do you think she wants to come with me when I break the news to Chaney? Well, if I were you, I'd ask her when you're done. You eat, that's orders. So you're just gonna tell him that Midnight up and took off and you expect him to believe that? More than I expect him to believe that the horse and I had a heart to heart and he decided he'd rather run away than live with Chaney. Megan? Megan! Oh, no... ? Who's standing there right by your side ? Gets to get lost in your eyes ? Hold your hand Put a smile ? On that perfect pretty face ? Who gets to carry you away ? Every single day ? When that picture that you picture comes true ? I want to be in it with you ? I want to be in it with you ? I want to be in it with you ? Every minute, I want to be in it with you ? Okay, let's have a big hand for Aaron Pritchett and his band for a rocking start to today's big race. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, on your marks. Whip Vickers here from Tallahassee, Florida to call the first annual Brett Chaney-Chaney Bank Milner Classic. Please turn your attention to the Chaney Bank mega-screen. Get ready and set for a good old country race. It's a three-mile course with enough hazards and obstacles to test the mettle of the most skilled horse and rider. And we are proud to welcome competitors, equestrians, one and all. ...assembled here today to inaugurate the first annual Chaney Bank Milner Classic. Nice try, darling, but you can't do that. I'm the registered rider. Actually, Mr. Shephard, anyone can ride. You registered the horse. No! It is too dangerous, we won't allow it. Absolutely not. Ross, you go find your father. Now! Go! I'm racing him and that's that. Midnight won't let anything bad happen to me. He's a part of our family. He saved you, Dad. Dad, you have to talk to Jack Shephard. There's a problem, he broke his arm and Megan is insisting that she ride in the race. That could be a blessing. What are you talking about? I need you to ride our entry Steeler in the race. What? Why? My jockey, he's a no show. The little creep called, he's still an hour out. By the sound of his voice, half asleep or worse. We have no one else and the race starts in less than 20 minutes. I can't. I mean... Why not? You're an excellent rider. You're a Chaney, Ross. You can't back down when things get tough. Brett, he doesn't want to race against the Shephard girl. Ride for the family name, Ross. He'll take care of me, and if you don't believe me then just ask him. I'm holding you to that. I think you just got your answer. It's important, honey, for all of us. Someone has to ride Steeler, otherwise we have to withdraw. Yes. Thank you, thank you, I love you both! We're going to win this, Dad! Midnight is going to win this for us! ...wild stallion named Midnight. One more thing... If you get any ideas, Chaneys don't lose. Our most prestigious entry, all the way from Chattanooga, Tennessee, Bixby racing pride and joy, Steeler. I must say if this horse runs anything like he looks, well, he could be the one to beat. Steeler will be ridden by champion jockey... Hold on, we have a rider change here. Steeler made his mark as the undefeated wonder horse making it all the way to the Kentucky Derby where he made a stunning debut placing half a length behind the triple crown threat, In The Meadow. Okay, here's the update. Special note, Brett Chaney doubled the prize money just to be able to enter a horse in his own race. And if Steeler should win, the prize money will be donated to the charity Belinda Chaney founded, Women Who Serve. Well, with one exception, all riders are on the starting line. Any rider and horse not in position by the one-minute mark will be disqualified. Some of you locals might want to give it up for your school mate and Milner High class president, Ross Chaney. This young man following the footsteps of his father will attempt to further the Cheney legacy that has left its mark on Milner. Oopsy doopsy, we have yet another rider shake up. Milner's own Jack Shephard was injured in a farm accident yesterday and his young daughter Megan Shephard will be taking his place atop the wild-as-a-tiger stallion they call Midnight. That is one magnificent horse who looks like he may be missing the wide-open wilderness that he no doubt... Oh, hold on. Hold on, cowgirl. This could be good. If she times out, it's a forfeit. I could win before the race even starts. Right now, it looks like a toss up as to whether she can get this powerful beast settled in time. And looking at the clock with less than 30 seconds to go, this race could be over for her before it starts. But not today my friends, Megan Shephard has tamed the beast and Midnight and his courageous young rider are officially in the race. Yeah! Why didn't you tell me you were riding Steeler in the race? I didn't know! My dad's jockey bailed, I was the only rider he had. You won't lose, Megan, I won't let it happen. If you let me win, Ross, I will never respect you or speak to you again. You sure don't make it easy. Just keep it an honest race. Riders, are you ready to ride? 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1... And they are off! Almost. It looks like our little cowgirl is still having trouble with that wild stallion. While Steeler takes an impressive lead as they thunder down the track. Midnight, it looks like he doesn't know whether he's coming or going. You can do it, Megan. Megan Shephard has taken control and they are in the race. Unfortunately trailing far, far behind. If you turn your attention to the mega-screen, Steeler holds his lead as they head down the windy hairpin followed by Avalanche, Dixie Mae and Mr. Swiftie... Just in from our track officials, there's been a little pile up... Come on, baby! ...and all involved have been eliminated. Oh, and look who it is, Megan and Midnight have moved up the pack and are gaining on the leaders. You go, girl. As they approach one of the most difficult challenges, just look at Steeler churning the water hazard into a thing of beauty. Splashing into second place, Dixie Mae with Mr. Swiftie on her tail. Oh! Look out, rider down. We've got a washout. So much for Positive Thinking and his rider Oliver... Mr. Swiftie moves into third and here comes Megan on Midnight. This girl is in it to win it. Steeler and Dixie Mae clearing the bridge jump. Mr. Swiftie gaining fast. Hold on, Mr. Swiftie doesn't like the look of that jump. Let's see if he's going to go for it or not. And Mr. Swiftie says no way. And it looks like that rider and horse are out of the race. Aww! And here comes Midnight. This kind of spirit is what horse racing is all about. Look at her glide over that jump. Not slowing as they race toward the homestretch. They are out of the woods and breaking for the finish line. Steeler dominating, maintaining the lead he has held from the start. And a tremendous showing, closing the gap is none other than the girl who's earning a place in our hearts, Megan Shephard on Midnight. Here they come. Ross Chaney rides Steeler to a first place finish for heat No. 1. And here's our gal climbing all the way to fourth position, let's have a big round of applause for Midnight and the "No stopping me now" spitfire, Megan Shephard. Heat No. 2 will start in five minutes. Really bad start. Sorry. Nothing to be sorry about. It's not how you start, it's how you finish. You just take care of yourself, okay? Yeah. We're ready. Horses on the line and riders in their saddles. Let's get ready to race. It's the second heat, starting gun is up. Riders, steady your mounts. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1... And they're off. No waiting for Midnight this time, not by a long shot. Oh, ouch! They don't call it a water hazard for nothing, folks. That cowboy is going home as Midnight dances away across the water into third place. Is that all you got? You said win! I'm not even in high gear yet. You mean like this? And as they come bursting out of the woods... It's Steeler and Midnight! Steeler and Midnight! Midnight! Talk about a comeback! She not only tamed the beast, she's riding him like a whirlwind. Go, Megan! This is going to be a close ride. Midnight's gaining, they're neck and neck... Across the finish line. The second heat is virtually a tie. Let's go, hurry. What a race we have today, folks! Who could have imagined this. You okay? It was like we were one. He told me, Dad. I knew I could count on you to do exactly what I knew you would do. What's that all about? Are you crazy? Crazy. How about stupid! For thinking you'd hold up your end of the deal. The race is not over! It is for you! You can't do this. It's my race, I can do just about anything I want. And right now I want Rico on Steeler. What's going on? Hey, I'm talking to you! Who are you? I don't like this, Jack. That's my daughter up there. I guess we know what that means now, don't we? You take care of her. We're good. Attention, if anyone needs their business taken care of now's the time to get it done. The third and final heat will start in two minutes. Here's a shocker! International racing champion Rico Martinez will replace Ross Chaney as the rider of Steeler. Let's have a big hand for young Ross. Martinez has raced at Pimlico, Belmont and Churchill Downs. That's right. Home of the Kentucky Derby. Your father and I wanted you here with us. We're a family, Ross, the community needs to see that. That's not the real reason, at all. Tell me the real reason. Megan, she's the real reason. You don't want me with her. We want what's best for you, Ross. What about what I want? There are better choices, Ross. People need to see your good taste and judgment in who you spend your time with, Ross. It reflects on us. If you're worried about what people think then you never should've hired that professional jockey. But worse, when you couldn't buy Midnight... Shh. ...you bring in Steeler, a professional racehorse. And you put the Shephard's ranch up for sale early because you knew that they were gonna lose. That is cheating, Dad! Cheating is a harsh word, Ross. Okay, Brett, I'm sure he didn't mean... No, I meant exactly what I said, Mom. And I don't wanna be like that. Well, you seem to prefer the Shephards' company to ours. They care about people and animals and I care about what happens to them. You don't know anything about caring, Dad... It's not something you can buy. It looks like bringing in a pro like Martinez has been a game changer here today, as Dixie Mae has suddenly dropped out of the race. Hey! Even Midnight senses that the stakes have changed. But it looks like Milner's own, Megan Shephard... Horses, on the line. We're ready for the third heat, it's virtually a two horse race, winner take all, run for the roses and the $50,000 purse. 3, 2, 1... And they are off! Steeler out in front and Midnight holding his own alongside. Anyone thinking that Rico Martinez was going to run away with this race, better think again. Midnight says, "Move over Steeler," and takes the lead on the one horse bridge. Yes! Yes! ...Rico's back in the lead! Come on, Megan! ...with Midnight on his tail. It ain't over till it's over and Milner's not giving up on their hometown girl. Midnight flies over the final jump as they head to the straightaway. Hey! What are you doing? Hey! Stop hitting my horse! Let go of my arm! Come on, Midnight! Go, Midnight! I hear you, Midnight. I hear you. Let's finish this thing. I can hear the thundering hoofs as they head out of the woods and onto the homestretch. Midnight is in the lead! Steeler gaining. Midnight charging forward. Neck and neck. We've got a photo finish on our hands. Pulling ahead and across the finish line first, Midnight wins! Megan Shephard has done it. Taking that wild stallion, Midnight, all the way to victory. There's gotta be some mighty proud parents in the stands right now. Give it up for Milner's new shining star! Yeah! The winner of the first annual Milner Classic, Megan Shephard. These are for you, Mom, for believing in us. Now about that wish? Did I just lose this battle also? Yeah! Well, this is just about a miracle, isn't it, Jack? Yeah! Know anything about this? No, nothing. I hope we're not intruding. You're not intruding. Uh, what can we do for you? Please, Jack, call me Brett. Belinda and I figured we owed you a congratulations on your win. I can't remember a race where I have been more excited. It was amazing. I hope our son hasn't worn out his welcome around here. Oh... Not at all, we like Ross. This is Melvin Weiger, he's a breeding scout. He saw the race and he would like to speak to you. Nothing has changed. Midnight's not for sale, if that's why you're here. Well, Jack, I'll let him tell you why but first I wanted to tell you that there will be no whips or meanness of any kind involved in my horse training in the future. I've seen the results of your talk training with that feral stallion. If you can do that with a wild animal... Boy, I'd sure be grateful for a lesson or two down the road. Well, you might get some tips from Ross. He's picking up on it pretty good. It's all about bonding. I'd like to congratulate you too, Mr. Shephard, and I'm not interested in buying your horse. But I do think there's good business in studding out Midnight and I'd like to be your agent. I even have your first client lined up. My first client? As a stud fee-paying client? Yes, sir. That'd be Mr. Brett Chaney here. He wants your stallion to sire his top mare. For a healthy fee, if you're game. Oh, we're game. You all are invited to join us for lunch. Unless you don't like barbecue, Jack's thick, juicy steak and my homemade potato salad. Well, I am watching my figure but that sounds too tasty to pass up. We would love to join you. Ross, come and help me get some extra plates and things. Please... Thank you. There's your miracle. Oh... Brett, can you open that for me?
