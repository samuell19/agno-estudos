Y'all need to go to church. Hallelujah. Man, ain't she fine? You ain't gettin' none of that high yellow bitch. Sure. If I don't get some of that, I give up your mama. - A dollar say you don't. - A dollar? Bet. Shoot. Thanks, man! - All right, Jackson. - Now, Martha. - I warned you. - Put that thing down. - Now out! - That's sharp. Martha, I was just tryin' to help the establishment.

You ain't never done a day's work in your life. Oh, Aunt Melba, that sure is cold. Most of the time I help to pay the rent. Mama, didn't I get a letter today? Did you look up on the dresser where the mail is kept? Y eah. If it's not on the dresser, then it ain't come yet. Now Jimmy Lee, I ain't playin' with you. What about jail?

Call me crazy when I come back with my first million. You think somebody's gonna pay you a million for that junk you write? - Has anybody heard Preacher's poetry? - Not me. "Your eyes are like limpid pools of eternity swallowing up my soul." Wait. There's more. Check this out. "Liquid dreams and visions of you beckon to my throbbing manhood." You copied that out of my notebook. What ya doin' goin' in my notebook? - What's with you? - He had no business in my notebook. Why don't you hit him with your throbbing manhood?

Let me count the ways." - This is dynamite. - You like poetry? Yeah. This is brilliant. I didn't know that. Oh, yeah, girl. But if you really like love poetry... you oughta check out a dude called Walter Benton. He got this poem called... "Were I Pygmalion or God... I would make you exactly as you are... in every dimension. From your warm hair to your intimate toes... would you be wholly in your own image. I would change nothing... add or take away. Yeah, that's dynamite. And that poem fits you too, you know? It really fits you. Yeah. I'm gonna give you that... as soon as I steal a copy. Damon, I don't want you to come in if you're gonna start trouble. - What you talkin' about? - Don't give me that. You always breakin' up parties fightin'. You ain't gonna break up this one. I come here to have a good time like everybody else. - Here, take this quarter. - I ain't playin' with you, Damon. Hey, man! - Nobody put their hands on my old lady! - Damon, I'm sorry! Get out of my way. I'm kickin' his ass. I apologize, but that's as far as it goes. There ain't gonna be no fightin' here. You take it outside. - Cool it, mama. - Cool it, my ass!

Man, that was some bad stuff Stone and Robert had. That was Sam's stuff. You know he ain't gonna sell it to us. Yeah, but Jimmy Lee can get it. - All right. - That's all right. Hey, fellas. It's about time. Hey, man, what y'all doin'? Why you ain't at the party? - Listen to him. - Man, come on. Hey, what we doin'? What about the party?

Change one or two and make 'em wrong. Hey, "W" means wrong, stupid. Does that mean to make it wrong, or it's already wrong? Y'all go ahead, man. I'll catch up with you later. Hello, Miss Stiff. Hey, Brenda. What's happenin', baby? Dig, let me-- I must have said or done somethin' to you durin' one of my blackouts, huh? Y eah. You see, I have these spells. It's somethin' like epilepsy. Doctors say there ain't no cure, baby. But when I come to, I've said and done all kinds of crazy things. Now, dig, see, the last thing-- The last thing I remember, we were in bed talkin', and I blacked out. - I don't want to hear it. - But it's the truth, baby. It always happens, especially when I'm excited or somethin'. Really happy. The adrenaline rushes from my head, and soon I'm unconscious. Baby, anything I do after that I'm not responsible for. Now, you got to forgive me. Aw, bab-- Oh, Brenda, don't be that way. Okay. Okay, I forgive you. That's for yesterday, bastard! - What's that all about? - Sandra, I can explain, baby. Listen. Um-- - Damon got it in the eye. Pow! - Oh, shut up with that jive. That's what you get. I'm bein' grounded for three months. - Three months? Damn. - My mother got down on me. Hello, Mr. Mason. - Hello, Mr. Mason. - Hey, wait a minute. Take off those shades. These is my shades and my face. Man, you can pull that "bad" act out on the street, but you don't move me. Now, you take off those shades before I bounce you off those hall lockers. Put 'em back on. And you better make at least a "C" on your midterm. - Afternoon, Mr. Mason. - Hi, Sandra. You, after school. You, after school. Hey, when you gonna bring up that fine daughter of yours so I can rap to her? Just as soon as I find out where you were last Friday. Now, I want to talk to you. Where you been all last week? - I was home sick with the flu. - That's a lie. Because I was at your house twice last week. I wasn't home. I was at my aunt's house. My mama sent me to my aunt's house while she go to work... 'cause she didn't want me to be home by myself. And then, see, my little sister's-- Okay. Hold it. All right, now. Class starts right now. All right, now. Class starts right now. As of this point... everybody in class shut up. Let me start by tellin' you again... that if you fail this test... you fail the course. Anybody caught cheating... will be an automatic fail... for both persons. Which reminds me, Preach. Get up here. - That's your desk, Mr. Mason. - Today you're my guest of honor. What can I do? All right. Put all books in your desk. The first half of the test will cover the Civil War. Pass these out, please. How you doin', George? - How you doin', David? - What are you doin' here? I have warrants for the arrest of Richard Morris and Leroy Jackson. - For what? - Grand theft, auto. All right, let's step it up. Turn to your left down there in the corridor. Come on. Hold it. - Can I go to the bathroom? - No. Come on in. Hold it. You. You in there. Come on. Get in there. Come on. You go in here. Come on in here. Come on. What did you do last Friday night? I was at this party on the West Side. - What time did you leave the party? - About 1:00. We left the party about 3:00 a.m.... and we caught the Jackson Street bus and we rode all the way-- Wait a minute. Last time you said you caught the "L." Oh, yeah. Yeah, see? We caught the "L" and then we took the bus. Look, I'm tired of you lyin'. For the last three hours, you told me four different stories. Mister, I swear on a stack of bibles... I ain't never been in a stolen car ever in my life. - And that's the truth. - Bullshit! No, it's not bullshit. I know those two kids. Those are good kids. Richard Morris just won a scholarship to college. You don't want him to lose that over a simple joyride. - These kids have to be taught a lesson. - Is it worth ruinin' their lives? You admit that they weren't even on the scene... when the car was stolen, right? Y eah, yeah. Well? Okay, they'll be out within an hour. Thanks, George. You're still my main man. What about the other two? No way. Their record is much too bad. Oh, man, change the grand theft, auto... to simple joyride or somethin'. Get outta here! Okay. Thanks, George. I won't forget it. See you Wednesday. I told the dude that we went to a party on the West Side... and then we went home, and we left at 1:00. Oh, man, no. No, man! I told them we left at about 4:00 a.m.... and that we didn't see Stone and Robert at all. - I told you not to say nothin'. - Nothin'? I had to say somethin'. - Morris and Jackson? - What's goin' on? - You're gonna go home. - Hey, what about us? You've gotta be booked. You're gonna stand trial. Let's go. I haven't got all day. Let's go. Guess I don't have to tell you who told on us. Damn. "Mama called and said she had to work overtime. She will be home late. - Hi, Mama. - Don't "Hi, Mama" me. What you doin' ridin' around in stolen cars? Mama, that wasn't me. They got the wrong somebody. - Don't lie to me! - I swear, Mama. They made a mistake. It was somebody that looked like me. Shut up! I don't wanna hear! What is this, Dee's sayin' you're upstairs with naked girls? And now you gone and got yourself arrested. You know I got three jobs. - And I've got to trust somebody. - Mama, you can trust me. - Go upstairs and get that belt. - Get my belt? Get that belt! Oh, Mama! I'm tired. I ain't doin' it no more. I'm tired. Mama, I been thinkin'. Maybe I oughta leave. I'm almost 18 years old now, and-- That's how you put it through the hoop, Junior. I got Cochise on my side, man. I ain't playin' with no chumps that squeal on their friends. - What you talkin' about? - They told on Stone and Robert. That's a lie! If you didn't tell, how come you out and Stone and Robert ain't? - I don't know! - Y eah. - Man, we didn't say nothin'. - Somebody oughta kick your ass. Don't worry. Stone and Robert are gonna do just that... when they get out of jail, chump! You better carry your baldheaded ass on out of here. Cochise, have you seen Preach? No, not since the gym. You don't know why he didn't come to class? Sure don't. Hey man, if you ain't got to pee, let me. Damn. Cool it! Mr. Mason! Hide the dice. You boys better get outta here. Class is gettin' ready to start. And leave the dice and the cards. What happened to you today? I don't understand you, Jackson. You read poetry books and history books for fun... and you make the worst grades in two states. You didn't even try to make up the midterm you missed. - Don't you want to graduate? - Don't much matter. Aw, man. For ten years I been pushin' kids through this school... just so when they applied for a job they could write... "high school graduate" on their job application. That's why when I find a guy who has potential... I hate to see him keep messin' up. Son, what is it you want? Huh? With your brains, you can have it. Whatever it is, man, knowledge will get it for you. Don't you want somethin'? I want to live forever. - You through, Mr. Mason? - Yeah, man. I'm through. And the next time you're in trouble, don't count on me-- jail or anything else. - You got us out. - Yeah. Who else? Mr. Mason, thank you. Thank you, hear? - What's the matter with you. - You'll never understand. I gotta find Cochise. Yeah, baby, this stuff is so good-- Hey, y'all. What's happenin'? - Hey, man, you seen Cochise? - Yeah, he's at my place, man. He took some chick up there a couple of hours ago to get down. You think he's still up there? 'Cause I got to talk to him. Probably. Why don't you come by with me? I got to go home anyway. - Okay. - Listen, fellas. Later. Just a minute. Come on, now! Hurry up in there! - You ain't in no big hurry. - I ain't got all day! Hey! You know who was-- - Wait a minute, man. - You son of a bitch. Hey, hey, man! What's goin' down here? He used to go with her, man. Aw, man! You mean to tell me you're mad about some bitch? - Let me talk to you, man. - I got nothin' to say. - Please? - Hey, man, let him go. Let him do what he want to do. - Can I talk to you? - Okay. Look, I know you got no reason to believe me. Why should you? It's my fault. I know that. But I'm sorry. Forgive me? See, in the beginning, it was like that. I mean, see-- Hey, Stone! What's happenin', man? - Hey, what's happenin'? - When did y'all get out? We just got out this mornin'. Our people got us out on bail. - What's wrong? - Huh? I just thought of somethin'. I got some business I gotta take care of right away. I want to talk to you, so meet me at the "L" station... - in 15 minutes. - The "L"? - Y eah, at the "L." - Are you sure? I'm positive. Go ahead, now. Hurry up. I'll be right there. Go ahead. Hey, Preach. - Hey, Preach, what's happenin'? - Hey, Damon. - How you been doin'? - Everything cool? Hey, Stone! Hey, Robert! What's happenin', man? Oh, dig, now. I know what you're thinkin', man. But dig, Mr. Mason got us out, man. - Bullshit! - Uh-uh. Let's check it all out. All right? We check it out, find out what really went down. And we can take it from there. All right? - I'm gonna stomp your ears together. - Hey, Cochise, tell 'em, man! - Get outta here! - What do you think I'm tryin' to do? - Will you get out? - Come out here! Now! - Ah, forget you, sucker! - Get outta here! - Girl, you crazy? - Get out of here! - Are you tryin' to find a new home? - Put that thing down! - I'm tryin' to go! - Get out! - Put that down. Calm down, will you? - Will you get out? I'm trying to find a way out. Wait a minute. The whole world will be in here, and it's all your fault! - Rape! Rape! - Rape? Shut up! - Will you please leave? - Later for you, sissy! - No, leave! - Your mama's a sissy too! - You want me to use this on you? - Okay, mama, okay. - All right, let's go. - All right, we'll leave. He gotta come out here sometime, and we'll be waitin' on him. Yeah, but not in here. Let's go! - Get outta here! - Wait a minute. Put that down! What are you doin'? Get out of here! Get out! Come on in, sucker! I got somethin' for your ass! - Come on in! - No, don't! Wait a minute! Stop! - They're gone! - Good. Now you can get outta here! Wait a minute. Don't open that door yet. I don't want anyone to see me like this. - Turn around. - Jesus Christ! I don't want anyone to see me like this. Turn around! I ain't lookin' at you. I'm tryin' to get outta here. - Just turn around and don't look. - All right. I ain't gonna look! - Turn around, then. - Okay. I'm turnin' around. Ooh, nice. Very nice. Martha, open the side door for me, please. Martha, please? - Have you seen Preach? - Yeah. He was supposed to meet me here. Last time I saw him, he was at Martha's. Stone and Robert had just come in. - He was actin' sort of crazy. - Oh, man. How long ago was that? - About 20 minutes ago. - Y eah, okay. Later. Hurry up. Come on, girl. Oh, by the way, Cochise was lookin' for you. Later for Cochise. I'm in love. But he seemed a little upset when I told him you were at Martha's. Upset. Yeah, I bet. What'd he say? Nothin'. I just told him Stone and Robert had come in, and he ran off. - Stone and Robert? - Yeah. - And he went off lookin' for me? - Uh-huh. Oh, wow. Look, baby, I gotta get off at this next stop. Oh, don't get mad, Brenda. But I can't explain now. I gotta get off. I'll call you later tonight. Hey, y'all got-- It wasn't us! Kill him! I bet you won't tell nothin' else. Get up! Get up, chump! Hey, man. Have you seen 'Chise? He just went towards the subway. - Was Stone or Robert with him? - No. What's happenin', man? Hey, 'Chise. You all right, man? Help! Help me, somebody! Help, please! For the dudes who ain't here. You know, sometimes I be walkin' down the street or sittin' around... and I look up, and I expect to see you comin' around the corner... or hear your voice callin' my name. I almost expect you to go to Hollywood with me. I know. Don't worry, man. I'm gonna make it. I can lie and steal too good not to survive. Pooter and the guys... they gonna be all right, man, they gonna make it. We were sittin' around the other night, we got high. And I told 'em, "'Chise wouldn't want you all just sittin' around... wastin' time, you know? They gonna make it. Man, I have so much to tell you. I wrote a poem for you. Nigger, I know you don't like poetry, but I'm gonna read it to you anyway. I never read my poetry for nobody, not even my mama. See the damn thing. It goes... "We were friends a long time ago... Iaughin', rappin'... chasin' girls... obeyin' no laws, except the one of caring. Basketball days and high nights. No tomorrows. Unable to remember yesterday... we live for today. Aw, man, it don't rhyme. You could've been the greatest, man. You could've been. I gotta go.
