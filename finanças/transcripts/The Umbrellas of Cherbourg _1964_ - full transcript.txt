THE UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG PART ONE -THE DEPARTURE Is it finished? The engine still knocks when it's cold, but that's normal. Foucher! Can you stay an extra hour? Tonight, it's a problem. But I think Pierre is free. Pierre, can you stay tonight? Check the ignition on the gentleman's Mercedes. Are you coming to the game? No, I can't. Are you going? Sure. Aubin asked me to stay overtime... No way! Tonight is special! I'm going to the theater. What are they playing? Carmen! I don't like operas. Movies are better. I'm going dancing tonight. Give me a smoke. All that singing gives me a pain. I like movies better. You said that already. See you tomorrow. My love... oh, my love. Geneviève, my little Geneviève. Guy, I love you. You smell like gasoline. It's just another perfume. Guy, I love you. Oh, Guy, I love you. A customer. I have to run. See you at 8:00 in front of the theater. I've thought of you all day! Would you like to go dancing later? If you wish. Can I help you? An umbrella. Where were you? Just across the street. Have you decided which kind you would like? An umbrella. A black umbrella. Geneviève, show the gentleman the umbrellas. Is that you, Guy? Good evening, Aunt Elise. Good evening, my boy. How are your legs? Fine, my boy. What are you up to? I'm hungry. You'll spoil your appetite. I do what I please. Calm down and talk to me. I haven't much time. You seem very nervous. I'm going out. Alone? None of your business. I think it is. With a girl. Do you love her? It could be. Tell me the truth. Yes, I love her. What's the matter? You're crying! No, I'm not. I can see that you are. Is it because you're lonely? I'm not lonely. I have my books. Madeleine will give me my shot. She will keep me company. What, then? Maybe happiness makes me sad. That's silly. You big brute, you're messing up my hair. Good evening, Guy. Good evening, Madeleine. You are sad. You seem happy. Does it show? I had a terrible time... Why? Persuading Mother. It was getting late, and the seamstress was late. Look. Careful, it's still full of pins. You know, I think she suspects something. Who? Mother. When I said I was going to the theater with Cécile, she gave me a funny look. What kind of a look? Like that. She knows quite well that Cécile hates shows, and since I'm a very bad liar... That's what you say! I assure you, I'm very awkward. I stammered and blushed and immediately changed the subject. Something squeezed. Something? Lemon. The same. Do you love me? A mambo. Let's go! I should have changed shoes. We'll have children. I'll call my daughter Françoise. And if it's a boy? It will be a girl. We've always had girls in the family. One o'clock. If Mother's not asleep, what a scene there will be. I should wear makeup, don't you think? You're lovely as you are. A little bit here. Where? There. We'll sell umbrellas. No, not umbrellas. We'll sell the shop. We'll buy a gas station. Why? What an idea! All white, with an office. You'll see. You'll smell like gasoline all day. What happiness... We'll be very happy... And we'll stay in love... You haven't told your mother? Not yet. Why? You're a coward. You mustn't be angry. I know what she'll say. What? "My little girl, you're crazy. Thinking of marriage at your age!" My little girl, you're crazy. Thinking of marriage at 16! Seventeen. In love! Am I too ugly or too stupid? No, you're not ugly. You're not the fairest of them all, but you're neither ugly nor dumb. The thing is, you have plenty of time. You think you're in love. But love is something different. You don't just fall in love with a face that you've seen in the street. He's a young man I've met several times, and he loves me. We want to get married. You don't answer? I'm flabbergasted. I went with him to the theater last night. Great! First you lie to me, then you admit it without the slightest shame. There's no shame in wanting to get married. At your age, there is. Well, no... You're just a little girl. You know nothing. Well, what you've taught me sure won't take me very far. When I married your father, I knew nothing. That's nothing to brag about. The paint shop, please? Next door. How old is he? Twenty. Of course, he hasn't done his military service yet. He lives with his godmother, the lady who raised him. I'm all he has, and you'll see, he's very handsome. I'll see nothing of the kind. But Mother... Go upstairs to the apartment. It's time to fix lunch. Geneviève! We're ruined! You always exaggerate. I owe 80,000 francs by the 15th. Is that funny? And if you don't pay? They'll seize our property. I'll get a job. What sort of a job? Anything. Post office or city hall? Why not? You understand, if I get married, Guy and I will work, and we'll help you. But, my little girl, it's out of the question for you to marry. Take that away. You're in my way. Anyway, what can he do? Can he support you? Raise children? He's not rich. We'll live modestly, and we won't have children right away. No, but one at least. He's not the one who will pay my taxes. There isn't a penny left in the till. Sell your jewels. My jewels? Never! What good are they? You don't even look at them. What if there's an emergency? Isn't what's happening an emergency? Impossible! If I sold my jewels, I'd feel... stripped and naked. Find something else. Something else? We have nothing. Then sell the shop. Stupid! What will we live on? Then again, a jewel is just a jewel. Should I change my hairstyle? My engagement ring... It's atrocious. This bracelet... I could never wear it. Nobody will want that. What about your necklace? My necklace? You think? That'd be a crime. No, I'll never part with it. Anyway, it's probably fake. Come on! Then again, it's not that pretty. This afternoon we'll go see Mr. Dubourg. Then I'll have my hair done. How beautiful! Truly marvelous. Isn't it? This is an impressive stone... if I may say so. Here are rubies, sapphires, emeralds. Ali Baba's cave. The jewels... of Sleeping Beauty. Of Sleeping Beauty. Hello, Mrs. Emery. Hello, Miss Geneviève. Hello, Mr. Dubourg. Will you excuse me? Please. The young lady has become very pretty. It's been such a long time since I've had the pleasure. But what can I do for you? You may speak frankly. We are in an embarrassing situation. Geneviève helps me as much as she can. It has nothing to do with her. But I have heavy expenses and I thought... Well, I have a payment to meet and if I don't, consequences will be dire. So I come to you as to my savior. I hesitated a long time, and Geneviève, who is the voice of wisdom and reason, persuaded me. It breaks my heart to be forced to give up this jewel, which to me represents... I understand, dear madame, but my business involves risks and I've already taken too many. At best, I can put your necklace up for sale, but for much less than its real worth. I cannot buy it myself. Couldn't you at least give me an advance? Nothing, I told you. We can do nothing. Don't insist, Mother. This is a disaster. Excuse me, but I'm interested. I'll buy your jewel. I can save you from your predicament. Allow me to introduce myself. Roland Cassard, diamond dealer. But, sir... Don't worry, madame, I'm no philanthropist. I'll easily sell this necklace in Paris or London, where I often go on business. I don't know if I should. Please, I'm serious. I'm ashamed, and at the same time, delighted. I don't have enough cash with me. I can give you a check. There's no hurry. Could you come tomorrow to my shop? "The Umbrellas of Cherbourg." I'm always there. See you tomorrow. What time is it? 6:15. How come he isn't here yet? He might be a crook. He could have been leading you on. Don't imagine things. What's the matter with you? Nothing, Mother. Then be quiet. I'm going to see Guy. I forbid you to see that boy. Stay here. I wouldn't want to be disrespectful... Well, that's good! But I'm going. You'll stay here. Anyway, Mr. Cassard will be here soon, and I want you to be present. Why? Because! If he's a crook, as you said, we'd better face him together. You think we'll be smart enough? I don't know, but stay here. I can't. Don't leave. I don't want you to leave. Geneviève! I had given up waiting for you. Are you crying? It's nothing. Sometimes I don't have the courage to deal with my troubles and my debts. Am I not here to help you? It's most kind of you. I just saw Miss Geneviève. I would have liked... She's gone out. The life we lead is so sad for a young girl. This dreary shop... I no longer amuse her, and I fear she'll become depressed. You see, she's bored. Would you like some tea? With pleasure. We've just had a terrible fight about you. About me? She wanted to go out. I didn't want her to. We quarreled. We're so lonely since my husband died. Maybe you should... I don't know... take her to a show. Maybe. Will you come to dinner tomorrow? Geneviève would be happy to see you. Impossible. I must leave tonight. I'm going back to Paris, and tomorrow I'm off to London. Here's the money I promised you. Give Geneviève my best regards, and I shall not fail to visit you on my next trip. I was so afraid I wouldn't find you. I'm so happy to be with you! Now I'm laughing because I realize how foolish I am when I'm alone. I talked to Mother about our marriage. Of course, she said I'm crazy. And tonight she forbade me to see you. You see, I was so afraid. I'd go anywhere, I'd never see Mother again, rather than lose you. We'll marry in secret. It doesn't matter anymore now. We have plenty of time. I just received my draft notice this morning. I'll be gone for two years. So we'll have to talk about marriage later. With the war in Algeria, it will be a long time before I can come back. But I'll never be able to live without you. I won't be able to. Don't go. I'll die. I'll hide you... and keep you... but, my love, don't leave me. You know it's not possible. I won't leave you. My love, I have to go. I want you to know that I'll think only of you. And I know that you'll wait for me. Two years... Two years of our life! Don't cry, I beg you. Two years... No, I can't face it. Calm down. We have so little time left. So little time, my love, and we mustn't waste it. We must try to be happy. Of our last moments we must keep a memory more beautiful than anything. A memory to help us live. I'm so afraid when I'm alone. We'll be together again, and we'll be stronger. You'll meet other women... you'll forget me. I will love you until the end of my life. Guy, I love you. Don't leave me. My love, don't leave me. Come, my love. Is that you, Guy? Good evening, Aunt Elise. Are you in bed? I don't feel too well. Is there anything you want? Nothing. I just need to rest. Good night, my little one. I'm afraid... I love you. Where were you? With Guy. What did you do? He's leaving. He'll be away for two years. I can't live without him. I'll die. Stop crying. Look at me. People only die of love in movies. It's too cruel... Separation is cruel, that's true. But time fixes a lot of things. You speak of love. What do you know of love? Are you sure of your feelings? Mother, can't you see how unhappy I am? I know, darling, I know. I have also loved, and fought... and suffered. You should listen to me. I do listen to you. Isn't it better to wait? Two years from now, perhaps you will have forgotten Guy. No... I'll never forget him. If you still love him when he returns, you'll see. You must believe me. You must calm down and get this affair out of your mind. Have you had dinner? Yes, Mother. Have some fruit. You need distraction. Go out and live a little. It's not difficult. You're young, pretty and witty. You'll make friends your age... or older. Mr. Cassard came by this evening. He was sorry he missed you. I'm certain he could give you good advice. I can do without his advice. You're wrong! For me, he's the kind of man... Don't bore me with his kind! You look terrible. Leave me alone, Mother. Give me a kiss at least. Have faith. You'll see. Look at me, my boy. When you return, I don't know if I shall still be alive. But Elise! Don't say "but." I've had a good life, and I can leave it without regrets. Nonsense! Right, Madeleine? Of course. She's better already. I'll meet death before you do. It's the army, not the war. Before you go, I want you to know that everything I have will be yours. Don't ever forget me. Write me from time to time. Madeleine will keep you informed. Farewell, my little one. My love, I'll wait for you all my life. I'll think only of you. Stay. Don't go, I beg you. Stay, my love. It's not time yet. I'm leaving now. Don't look at me. I can't. I can't. My love... I love you... My love... I love you... I love you... My love... I love you... I love you... I love you... PART TWO -THE ABSENCE Well? Well what? You're so pale. What did the doctor say? Practically nothing. That I need rest. You didn't need to see a doctor for that. I could have told you myself. What else? He gave me a prescription. Sedatives, tonics and stuff. Stuff! Then it can't be very serious. You see, Geneviève, if the shop were doing better, I'd be the happiest of women. It's freezing. Do you know whom I met in town? You'll never guess. Roland Cassard! What do you say to that? What do you want me to say? He's incredibly nice. We talked for over an hour this morning. He's back from the US. What a man! He told me a thousand stories. I invited him to dinner. What's the matter, Geneviève? Nothing, I'm just tired. That's no reason for sulking like that. You may be tired, but you're not dying. It's not the fatigue that saddens me. It's his silence. Guy left two months ago. He's only written me once. Don't start that again! If I knew where he was, I could write him. I'm sure they've sent him to some dangerous place where he's risking his life. It's simpler than that. Simpler than what? He's forgotten you. You don't know what you're saying! He doesn't think about you. If he did, he would write. One can write, no matter how far away one is. It's nothing. I got so frightened. I suddenly saw Guy laughing with another woman. Sit down. I'll close the shop. You're hiding something. I'm not. It's serious, isn't it? I'm pregnant, Mother. This is horrible. Pregnant by Guy? How could this happen? Same as with everyone else. Don't joke about it. This is serious. What are we going to do? What do you mean? With the child? Bring it up. What will we say? To whom? I don't know... our neighbors, our friends! We have no friends. And you never speak to the neighbors. And Roland Cassard is coming to dinner tonight! We'll have to make him feel welcome and put up a good front. The way you look... pregnant... You don't need to tell him. Be quiet. It makes me shiver... just to think of it. Go upstairs and lie down. I feel just fine. Don't argue. Obey me. I'll cook dinner myself. Don't worry. Maybe you need some rest. Yes, Geneviève has been overdoing it somewhat lately. She's a bit pale. Why don't you go live in the country? The situation in which we find ourselves is such that we cannot, for the time being, take any rest. Geneviève wouldn't go alone, and I can't leave the shop. There's no way out of it. So you can't be separated? We've practically never been parted. I haven't found the bean. I have it. You must pick a king and make a wish. I have no choice. You are my king. Thank you, Geneviève. Put this crown on. Put it on, Geneviève, like he asked you to. You look like the Virgin with Child I saw in Antwerp. My cheeks are burning. How amusing! I think I drank too much. I'll leave you now. I'm not feeling very well. Then I'll be going. Please. Let's chat a bit more. Good night, my darling. I'm really worried. Geneviève is sad, secretive, independent. And I admit I'm probably not tactful or understanding enough. I'm always afraid of hurting her. I wouldn't want to sound ridiculous, and my feelings could seem insincere, however... although I am taking this step, I wouldn't want to give the wrong impression. My only desire is to bring happiness. Am I making myself clear? Actually, not really. Ever since dinner began, I've been trying to broach a subject that preoccupies me, but my feelings are equaled only by my shyness. I came to ask you for Geneviève's hand. I'm very clumsy, I know. Not at all, but this is so unexpected. Geneviève for me is still a child, and your abrupt request is somewhat unsettling. You see, I don't know Geneviève's feelings for you. She's only spoken of you as a friend. I wouldn't want to pressure her in any way. We know nothing about you. Long ago, I loved a woman. She didn't love me. Her name was Lola. It was long ago. Disappointed, I tried to forget her. I left France. I traveled to the ends of the earth. But I had no more taste for life. Then, by chance, our paths crossed. As soon as I saw Geneviève, I knew she was the one I'd been waiting for. Since I met her, life has new meaning. She's always before my eyes. I live only for her. I think only of her. I had to speak to you frankly. Don't be offended. Of course, I wouldn't think of influencing Geneviève. Geneviève is free. Tomorrow I go back to Amsterdam for three months. When I return, Geneviève can give me her answer. I don't know what to say. Don't say anything. Geneviève will decide for herself. You're not asleep? You can see that. Roland Cassard asked for your hand. I heard. You didn't tell him I'm pregnant? I didn't dare. I'm very proud of you. François is a pretty name for a boy. Time passes slowly here. Furloughs have been suspended, and I don't know if I'll be returning to France very soon. My love, I know you're waiting for me. Last night, one of our patrols fell into an ambush. Three soldiers were killed. All the same, I don't think that there's great danger here. But it is strange how sun and death travel together. Geneviève, come to dinner, darling. Dear Mr. Cassard, we greatly appreciated your postcard, Mother and I. I find these people ridiculous. I hate the carnival. Don't be bitter, darling. It's incredible how big you are! You're carrying in front. It will be a boy, or twins. No, everything is normal. I feel wonderful. You're like me. I was delighted, never sick. The day before you were born, I was up on a ladder, changing the wallpaper in the shop. Has the postman come? There were only bills and some advertising. Why? Are you still waiting? In his last letter, he wrote he was sad because he wouldn't see me pregnant. And perhaps it's just as well. I look awful. A pregnant woman is always beautiful, my darling. That's true. Look at this. A vest. And I saw pretty rompers at the department store. Admit that you're pleased. I'd be more pleased if that child had a father, and if you had a husband. Guy will return. Guy or someone else. Absence is a funny thing. It feels as if Guy left years ago. I look at this picture, and I forget what he really looks like. And when I think of him, it's this picture that I see. It's all I have left of him. Don't smoke. Be reasonable. What's that? A postcard from Hamburg. From Roland Cassard. For me? For us. You may read it. He says he'll be back soon. He asks if you've thought it over. It doesn't seem to me there's any hurry. No, but you must think it over. I am thinking it over, Mother. Here's a man, rich, refined, and enamored of you, and I think... What are you doing? Aren't you feeling well? I'm all right, Mother. You're eating. I can't help it. I'm always hungry. He's not a womanizer, a smooth talker on the prowl, but a man who has lived and suffered. I know, Mother, but don't give me a sales talk. You praise him like you praise your umbrellas. Because he'll protect you, Geneviève. Very funny. If you can't take a little humor, you're lost! Guy might have been your ideal, but what future did he offer you? You know, I too was once wooed by a young man who was not your father. You'd have done better to marry him. You're right. But understand that I want you to be happy and not ruin your life the way I ruined mine. Don't worry about my life, Mother. I have no intention whatsoever of ruining it. Do you think Cassard will want to marry me when he sees I'm knocked up? Watch your language! Deformed! Bloated! Since neither you nor I had the courage to confess the truth to him, now, at least, it will show! Do you believe he'll take me like this? If he refuses me as I am, it means he doesn't have deep feelings for me. But if, by some unlikely chance, he accepts me, I'll have no reason to doubt him, and I'd be a fool to reject him. So, you see, I'm thinking it over. But all this is so difficult. Why is absence so heavy to bear? Why is Guy fading away from me? I would have died for him. Why aren't I dead? Look. What is it? It's for you. Roland sent it for you. I can't accept it. Do as you like. We'll bring this child up together. He'll be our child. Please say yes, Geneviève. I don't want all this to upset you in the least. I love you, Geneviève. She accepts, since her present condition doesn't frighten you. But don't rush her. She's so fragile that the slightest mistake could compromise everything. PART THREE -THE RETURN NEW OWNER Madeleine told me everything. Why didn't you say anything? I didn't want to. I thought you knew. Didn't you suspect anything? Of course. Over the last few months, her letters weren't the same. She didn't answer my questions. She wrote without conviction. But from there to marrying another man! No, I thought she was mad at me, but I didn't know why. Then there was the hospital and my letters that went unanswered. Here nothing has changed. I have. I can let go now that you're here. I would have been so unhappy not to see you again. Don't talk nonsense. Come on, make yourself useful, my boy. Give me some herb tea. Everything's ready in the kitchen. There's water in the kettle. Something wrong with your leg? You see, I limp a little. It's like having a barometer in my knee. Especially when it rains. It was in the hospital that I suffered the most. But how did it happen? Returning one night from maneuvers. We were attacked. Hand grenades. It happened often. What about Madeleine? She's coming. She's been very good to me. Isn't she married yet? You know how well-behaved she is. Put it over there on the table. What will you do now? Work. Or maybe live off my pension. Aubin promised to take you back. You liked his gas station. Oh, his or someone else's. We'll see. I have time. There's no hurry. The child she was expecting... do you know anything about it? No. Geneviève left just after the wedding. Mrs. Emery stayed in Cherbourg a month or two. Then she sold the shop. I think they're in Paris. You haven't changed. I'm happy that you've returned. Foucher! The boss wants you. Shit! Did you service this gentleman's car? Complete checkup on the 26th, right, sir? Two thrown rods this morning. The engine is dead. A brand-new engine. Not a drop of oil! I'm not blaming anyone, but that's it. I'm real sorry. Did you check the oil gauge? Of course. You forgot to screw the cap on. I know my job. Don't talk to me like that! And apologize to the gentleman. I don't have to. It wasn't my fault. You don't give a damn about your work. Why don't you buy some new overalls? And shave before you come to work! I've had enough. I'll find another job. That stupid ass. Since he got out of the army, he acts like a hoodlum. What's going on? I'm quitting. I had a fight with Aubin and quit before he could fire me. What will you do? Live off my pension. A dry white wine. Another. Take it out of this. Don't you have anything smaller? You're all the same, with your big bills. What of it, you bum? Just do your job and lay off! Just forget it. What are you looking for? Nothing. Then move your ass. You're in the way. Cognac. Want to dance? Leave me alone. Something wrong, baby? Come with me if you want. You're really a sweet girl. Evening, Madame Germaine. Evening, Jenny. You can call me Geneviève if you'd like. You're going to say I remind you of someone. Good-bye, Jenny. Come again sometime. Sorry, Madeleine. I didn't have my key. What's the matter? Elise died last night. I can't stay any longer in this apartment. I'm too unhappy. I want to leave soon. But where will you go? I don't know. You have no family. Don't you want to stay here? What would I do? You'd help me. I'll be lonely. You don't need anyone. I need you, Madeleine. Why don't you just say you don't like being alone? I don't see what I could do for you. I have no influence over you. That's not true. I don't like what you've become. You hang about with nothing to do. You're sad and bitter. You've changed a lot. It's not my fault. Since I came back, things don't make sense anymore. I don't think I can help you. You're too far away. What if I asked you to try despite everything? I wouldn't hesitate to stay. I'm asking you. Then I'll try. I'm a bit late. The lawyer took forever, and I stopped by the garage. Now everything is settled. Poor Elise. Nothing will be left of her. On the contrary. She'll be part of everything we do. Are you happy? Very. And it's all thanks to you. Madeleine, you know it's true. And you? Are you happy? I'm not unhappy. I wanted to tell you... That is, I've been thinking that if you wanted to share my life... if I weren't too much of a burden... and that... Are you crying? No. Did I say something wrong? Not at all... but it makes me so happy, and at the same time, it scares me. You're scared of me? No... a little... well... you understand... Have you given up thinking about Geneviève? Are you sure you really love me? I'm not scared, but I wonder if you're not acting out of despair. You're quite wrong. I don't want to think about Geneviève anymore. I assure you, I've forgotten everything. I want to be happy with you. Madeleine, don't cry. I don't have much ambition... but if I could make this dream come true: To be happy with a woman... in a life we've chosen together... I'm done. It's very beautiful. You think so? Your hands are cold. I'm going out now. If you want. Our son would like to see the toys in the store windows. He's been talking about it all week. I'll take him for a look before dinner. Stop that, will you? François, you'll make us deaf! I got you a lovely Christmas present. What is it? It's a surprise. You'll see. Bundle up. I love you, Guy. François, come and put your coat on. Say hello to Santa Claus for me. Françoise, stop that. The horn isn't a toy. It's cold. Come into the office. It's warmer here. This is my first time back in Cherbourg since I got married. I went to pick up my daughter at my mother-in-law's in Anjou. On the way back to Paris, I decided to make a detour. I never thought I'd run into you. It's pure chance. Does madame want me to fill it up? Geneviève... Yes, fill it up. Super or regular? It doesn't matter. Which do you want? Super? This is a pretty tree. Did you decorate it? No, my wife did. It's mostly for the kid. Of course. Are you in mourning? Mother died last autumn. What did you name her? Françoise. She's a lot like you. Do you want to see her? I think you're all set. Are you all right? Yes, I'm fine.
