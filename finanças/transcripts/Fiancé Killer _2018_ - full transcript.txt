NICOLE: My mother always told me that what you stood for was more important than the bottom line. And that's why at Veritase Cosmetics everything we make is 100% certified organic. It's been almost 15 years since we started, and we know we're not the biggest or the most expensive, but that's not what we set out to be. We just wanted to be the best. What do you think? I think it's perfect. The Young Women's Business League is gonna love it. All right. Great. I just wanna go through it - one more time. - Uh, it's 5:30. Don't you have that early dinner with Cameron tonight? Thank you. Yes. Okay. Great. (SIGHS) Happy hour. Hoo. All right. So where are we at with the final presentation? Well, we have our three finalists, but they're expensive. Well, we have to spend money to make money. I don't have to tell you how nervous that statement makes me. Oh, come on, Grace. You've been my CFO long enough to know that we got this. Come on. Say it with me. We got this. All right. You keep working on that. Anything else? Uh, yeah. Your daughter has some sort of a surprise for you, but you didn't hear it from me. Okay. (SIGHS) Great. I'll see you tomorrow. (CHUCKLES) Have fun. (MUSIC) Mom. Cameron. - Hi. - Hi. Oh, I'm so happy you're home safe. Yeah, well, it's good to be back. So how was Playa? I wanna hear all about it. Oh, and what is the big surprise? (CHUCKLES) Um, it's not so much a what, as a who. Hi. Mom, I'd like you to meet Brent Danner, my fiance. I'm engaged. Mom, say something. - Uh, I'm just... - Shocked. I'm sure. Yeah. How did this happen? Um, uh, why don't we sit down, and I'll tell you all about it, hmm? Okay. BRENT: There I was, 7:30 at night, storm rolling in off the gulf. It's raining really hard. I'm... frantically late for dinner. I look up, and I see this one. Um, and I was waiting for a taxi and, of course, I forgot my umbrella. Yeah. So I ran up, I take my coat, I put it over her head, and I say... "You know, they invented something for this." Yeah. And she says, "Yeah, it's called a jacket." - Bug. - Bug. (CHUCKLING) CAMERON: Uh, anyways, then we spent the rest of the night exploring the city. And Brent even pulled a few strings and got us into the state museum. Yeah. I know a guy who used to run security there. Oh. What line of work are you in, Brent? I'm a contractor. Uh, he's being modest. He runs a nonprofit that he cofounded. They modernize village infrastructures in the developing world. Is that something that you went to school for? Well, I mean, I got my MBA from USC, but, honestly, it doesn't really help when you're up on a roof laying wire in 100-degree heat. That's tough, uh, tough job. Um, something you see yourself doing long-term? Uh, call me idealistic but, uh, I think there's more to life than money. GRACE: She did what? NICOLE: She got engaged, ring and everything. It's insane. Well, is he hot? Come on, Grace. It's my baby girl we're talking about. I know, but put yourself in her flip-flops. I mean, she just got a full ride to her dream law program, including her first space without roommates, and then she meets some handsome stranger who sweeps her off her feet and proposes marriage. Her future is bright. Yeah, specially, after her birthday. The big 2-5. That's when her trust fund kicks in, right? Yup. $3 million is a lot of money. And it's a target. Okay. I know that you never really saw eye-to-eye with your father, but he knew what he was doing when he left her that money. She's a smart girl with a good head on her shoulders. Grace, she's too young for this. Okay. Right. Listen, I'm off to bed. We've got an early day tomorrow. You should try to get some rest too. Good night. (SIGHS) (MUSIC) NICOLE: I mean, I like some of the design elements, but I don't think that this is Veritase. GRACE: Okay. All right. So we'll keep the model. Oh, hello, tall, dark, and handsome. Brent, what are you doing here? I brought you lunch. So how did you know I like sushi? Cameron said it was your favorite. Well, that's very thoughtful. She also said that you don't like surprises. And that is also true. Look, I'm not sure if she told you this, but... both of my parents died when I was very young. Oh, I'm sorry. And I never thought that I'd have a chance to be a part of a family again. I don't wanna mess that up. Just so you know, I won't marry your daughter without your blessing. - You won't? - No. (SIGHS) That's why I'm here. Nicole, may I have your blessing to marry Cameron? (SIGHS) Brent, I really appreciate the effort, but I just met you last night. I think it would be in all of our best interests if maybe we just slow down a little bit. These things take time. We could revisit this conversation in six months. Yeah. You're right. You know, these things do take time, and... I wanna do this the right way. I'm glad we had this talk. Well, I should get out of your hair. I'm sure you have a lot of work to do. Who's Brent Holvik? What? I thought your name was Brent Danner. Who's Brent Holvik? (SIGHS) I am. Yes, I was born Brent Holvik, but... after my, um, mother passed, I took her maiden name, Danner, in her honor. Oh, that's very sweet. (MUSIC) (SIGHS) Sharon, I need you to run a check on someone for me. CAMERON: You what? I ran a credit check on him. Do you have any idea what a breach of trust that is? I followed my intuition and it paid off. There's a lot about Brent's past that he's not telling you. What are you talking about? Well, he changed his name five years ago after he filed for bankruptcy. And before that, there's a huge hole in his record, all right? No credit history, no bank accounts, nothing. It's like he stopped existing. He's bankrupt because his business partner embezzled everything and ran their startup into the ground. Oh, and that huge hole, he was in South America doing deep research on rural villages. So, yeah, he sounds like a real bad guy. I don't know what kind of guy he is because I met him 24 hours ago. And he comes waltzing into your life a month before you inherit $3 million. So forgive me if I'm a little suspicious, okay? Uh, I'm just... I'm trying to protect you. Well, this is the wrong way to do that. I just wanna be a part of your life. Yeah, well, you're about 15 years too late for that. You know, that's not fair. After your father died, I started Veritase because I need it to support us. But I'm here now, okay? And I... I just wanna help. I understand that. I do. But this, this is not helping. Where are you going? To plan my wedding, alone. I can't believe you. (SIGHS) (MUSIC) (SIGHS) I missed you. You're not supposed to be here. And you're supposed to be engaged, but... what your little fiancee doesn't know won't hurt her, at least, not yet. She's still innocent, and that's how she needs to stay, until she turns 25. And becomes my wife. And then she dies. (CHUCKLES) And, legally, all that money goes to her poor grieving husband. You don't know how I've missed you. She's home. You got to go. I'll come to you. Tomorrow night. Don't forget. Hey, what's wrong? It's my mom. She ran a credit check on you. What? Uh, why... Why would she do that? Because she's a paranoid. She even revealed you being bankrupt like it's a lie or something. Uh, but we talked about that. I know. I know. Uh, I'm sorry. She's always been like this. She's never there for me when I needed her, but as soon as I brought someone home, she finds something wrong with them. And I know she's just trying to protect me, but between that and trying to plan a wedding, I... Uh, it's overwhelming, all right? Yeah. Hey, hey, hey, I know you are going through rough time right now, but... you're gonna get through this. I love you. That's all that matters, right? I love you too. Why don't... why don't you call her tomorrow. I'm sure she'll think differently about it when she sleeps on it. (SIGHS) Okay. All right. I will. (SNIFFLING) Okay. Um, I'm gonna go upstairs, okay? (PHONE RINGING) Cameron. Hey, mom. Listen, I said some things yesterday that I probably shouldn't have. But I just think if you could spend some time getting to know Brent, you could see why I love him so much. Okay. We'll give him a second chance, of course. For you, honey, all right? How about dinner tonight at the house around 7:00? Actually, that works. Okay. Great. Thank you, Mommy. Thank you so much. Hey, we'll bring the wine. All right. I'm looking forward to it. (MUSIC) NICOLE: So you'd already drawn up all the plans. You had everything measured down to the last square foot. So? What's wrong with that? I was a very thorough kid. It was a tree house. (LAUGHS) I'd love to see that. Be careful what you wish for. So, Brent, how are things at the nonprofit? We're busy. Um, I've been meeting with a friend of mine from Guatemala. A friend? You mean, the deputy... of the Guatemalan State Department. My buddy, Rigo. We've been trying to work together on something for a while now. There's a lot of need down there. But it's difficult navigating the bureaucracy. And that's where Rigo comes in. We're pushing the permits through. We're breaking ground this November. What? Won't you be in the middle of your program then? I will, but Brent can travel back and forth. He doesn't have to be down there full time. Oh. Mom, we'll figure it out. Rest room? Uh, yeah, next to the front door. Excuse me. Will you stop being so judgmental? (MUSIC) What are you doing in here? I was looking for a pen. This is a private office. You can't be in here. Oh, I'm so sorry. I... I didn't mean to intrude. What's going on here? Mom? I don't know, Cameron. Why don't you ask Brent? Like I said, I was looking for a pen. I wanted to give you a thank-you card. I wanted you to have these. They were my mother's. That is so sweet. I'm sorry, Brent. I wanted to give you a second chance but I can't. What's this supposed to mean, that I'm replacing your dead mother? - Mom. - I can't play along like this, Cameron. Mother, stop. Number one, you're too young. I can't believe you are doing this right now. What am I supposed to do? - I don't... - Nicole, I love your daughter very much, and I wanna marry her. But I also respect your relationship, and I don't want to get in the middle of it. I think it's best if I just left. No. Brent, wait. Wait. Brent, please. (MUSIC) He tried to give you a gift and you turned it around on him? What is the matter with you? Brent, wait. Let me explain. (MUSIC) CAMERON: She's treating you like you're some gold digger who's waiting for me to inherit the money before skipping out on me. Well, you know money is the last thing that's important to me. I mean, if it's that's much of a problem then... - we could wait. - (CHUCKLES) We'll be waiting a long time for the world's most paranoid mom to come to her senses. (CHUCKLES) Who keeps texting you? It's Rigo. He's working late trying to finalize the contract. She's never gonna change her mind. She's probably not even gonna come to the wedding. I know her. There's gonna be some emergency at Veritase. You know, I don't know why I'm trying to pull this together. Well... why do we even need a big wedding anyway? What do you mean? We could just... elope. - Really? - Yeah. I mean, you got this place for a couple more months till school finishes. So we've got a roof over our heads. We're in love. What more do we need? We could hop on a flight tomorrow to Vegas. Uh-uh, no. Let's do it tonight. Well, I was just thinking with the weekend coming, - I mean, we could... - No, babe, I don't wanna wait. I'm ready. Let's do it now. (PHONE BUZZING) Yeah. Let's do it. (MUSIC) Hey, it's Brent, can't get to the phone right now. Leave me a message. Aaah! (SIGHS) is this more of an "I need a hug" moment? What? (SIGHS) You didn't know? She eloped? Maybe she was trying to save money. No. She did this because I told her not to. (SIGHS) Sharon, can you please cancel the rest of my meetings for today? No. You don't wanna do that. (SIGHS) Hold off. Why not? Because she's already made her choice. The more you attack that, the harder she clings to him. (SIGHS) Okay. So what am I supposed to do? Oh, what would you want your mother to do if you ran off and married some handsome stranger? (CHUCKLES) - Here we go. - Okay. Put me down. (LAUGHS) - (LAUGHS) Water? - Yes. I am done. - Me too. Water, my wife. Thank you, my husband. (CHUCKLES) I'm gonna hop in the shower. Okay. Hmm, you want me to order a pizza? - Sounds great. - Okay. (KNOCK ON DOOR) You're not expecting anyone, are you? Uh, no. Can I come in? Sure. (MUSIC) NICOLE: Cameron, when your dad died, I should have been there for you. And instead of dealing with the pain, I focused on the business. I don't know. I thought it would help me forget. And that wasn't fair to you. And I don't wanna lose any more time with you. I was thinking... for your 25th birthday, I'd love to throw you a huge party. And you could see it as, I don't know, a belated wedding reception too. I just wanna celebrate you. I wanna celebrate both of you. Brent, I owe you an apology for the way I treated you. Do you think maybe we could start over? I would love that. Great. (PHONE BUZZES) (CLEARS THROAT) Hey, sweetie, I think I'm gonna go take a bubble bath. Um, listen, Rigo just texted me. He's got a layover and he wants me to meet him for some drinks at the airport. It might go a little late. You don't mind, do you? No, of course not. Thanks, babe. Have fun. (MUSIC) LEXI: How could you? You went and married her. That was the plan. Not on that night. That was our anniversary. You promised me. All right. Calm down. Don't tell me to calm down. Do you understand what I've sacrificed for this? How much I've put on the line to get us this far? My future, my career, our life together. And you go off and do some last-minute improvising?! - No. It was her idea. - Oh. So she's calling the shots now. Don't forget, I picked this girl out after her grandfather drafted that trust. I read through her pathetic social media posts and waded through her idiotic Instagram to make sure that you were everything she wanted. All you have to do is play that part. - And that's what I'm doing. - Is that what you were doing in Vegas? I did what I had to do, okay? I'm sorry. Don't tell me you're sorry. Stick to the plan, our plan. Okay. GRACE: Okay. So here's the invoice for the website renovations. Yeah, that looks great. Oh, okay. So now on to something that you're actually going to care about, reviewing the menu for Cameron's wedding reception. So there's gluten-free and vegetarian options for people like you, and then there's some normal food for people like me. I love the idea of cupcakes. Great. Just make sure nothing has any nuts. I already went over Cameron's allergy with them. They deal with this all the time. They're very careful. No nuts. Okay. Perfect. They're gonna love it. Yeah, I hope so. I have a lot of lost time to make up for. Well, you know what, you've been putting in a lot of extra hours lately. So when I make that cupcake order, I'm gonna have them throw in a couple of extra for you. Okay. (MUSIC) Here you go. It's perfect. Would you like to add a personalized card? Yeah. Um, "Dearest Lexi", a taste of things to come. "Love, Brent." Excellent. - Here you go. - Thank you. Brent? Nicole. What a surprise. What are you doing here? Just running some errands. How about you? Oh, anniversary present, uh, I mean, it came about a month ago. Oh, that's really sweet. Can I see? I heard you had a big meeting last night. Oh, yeah. Rigo had a layover, so I met him for some drinks at the airport. Oh, what bar? I have meetings there all the time? Oh, I'm sorry. Late night. Uh, his flight got delayed, so I met him at a bar downtown. Oh. Oh, Brent, this is gorgeous. She's gonna love this. I thought so too. Unfortunately, I have to get to a meeting. The world can't save itself, right? But, uh, it's great to see you. You too. Take care. (MUSIC) (MOANING) (MUSIC) Having a good time? What the hell are you doing here? I wanted to make sure you're performing your duties as a good husband. Uh, you can't be here. Hey, what if she wakes up? What if she what? Oh... what if your wife wakes up, finds out her Prince Charming has been lying to her face. - Shh. - This whole time? You are gonna mess this whole thing up. No. You're going to mess it up. That girl is in your head. No. That's ridiculous. You don't know what you're talking about. You don't think I know how she touches you? BUT THAT'S JUST HOW I WANT IT:, You keep playing your role, at least, until the reception this weekend, when your wife is going to have a terrible accident. No, no, not at the reception. There'll be too many people there. It'll be perfect. It'll happen in plain sight. Everyone will see you doing everything you could to save her, but, of course, that's not going to be possible without this. There's probably... a backup EpiPen at the mother's house. Make sure that one's misplaced too. When it's all over, the blame falls on the caterer, and we'll live happily ever after. (MUSIC) Do you love her? CAMERON: Babe. What are you doing? All right, get out of here, go. Uh, I was getting some water. Sound like you were talking to somebody. No. Are you sure? 'Cause I heard you whispering. Oh, trying to get this open, I was probably. - CAMERON: Oh. - Talking to myself. Oh. Okay. Well, you wanna get back to bed? - Yes. - Let's go. ANDREW: All right. Yeah. No, no, I'll hold. I'm on hold. Waiting for confirmation of the wire transfer. Are you nervous? I don't know. You should be. $3 million is a lot of money. Yeah. Have you thought about what you're gonna do with it yet? Well actually, um, I've been talking with Brent about maybe using some of it to build a house. There's that spot that I like, and I talked to the real estate agent the other day and he said it's still available. I know. I know, you want me to think about it for a while before I do anything crazy. No. It's not that, it's... And I have been thinking about it for a long time. I've just been waiting for it to feel right. You know, I'm with Brent and... It feels right. Yeah. I know you're still getting to know him, but, Mommy, he makes me happy. Well, if he makes you happy, honey, I'm happy. It's all that matters to me. All right. Very good. Okay. All right. We're all set at the bank. We're almost finished. I just need your signature on a few more documents and... Um, Alexa, do you have those forms? Of course, Mr. Rader. Thank you. Okay. Sign here. (MUSIC) Congratulations. You are officially a multi-millionaire. Oh, my God. Well, I guess we know who's buying dinner. Deal. LEXI: Well. Would you look what the cat dragged in. Come to apologize? I came here to bargain. You've had your fun, but for this to work, it has to stop now. All of this has to stop. This doesn't stop until it's over. Well, trust me. It'll be over a lot quicker if you give me some breathing room. Let me do what I have to do. What's in the box? I got you this to make up for us not being together on our anniversary. I believe in us. Now I need you to believe in me. Let me do this. All right. (MUSIC) Unrefined nut protein oil. One drop and it's all over. Brent. Don't fail me. Are you sure I have to wear a tie to this thing? Yes. I want you looking dapper. Good luck with that. Well, we never had a proper wedding for all of our friends to see us dressed up. I just wanna show everyone how handsome you are. All right. Let's see if I can fix this tie. So, how does it feel to be married to a bona fide millionaire? Look, I want you to know that this money is never gonna mess anything up between us. I wanted you before you were rich and nothing's ever gonna change that. I love you, Cam. I love you, too. (MUSIC) You don't know what you're doing with this, are you? No, I really don't. Get out of here. - You're a bug. - Yeah. (MUSIC) Babe, have you seen my phone? Uh, yeah. It's right here. Ah, doy. You know, I swear all the money in the world, you can't buy a better memory. Oh, hey, let me help you with your collar. Please, yeah. 'Cause we got to go. All right, all right. Yup. Center. Awesome. Okay. Now, let's go before we're late to our own wedding reception. Okay. I'll be right down. Okay. (MUSIC) BRENT: I love you, Cam. I love you, Cam. I love y... GRACE: Oh, sweetheart, you look so pretty. And you, Brent, you are so handsome. Oh. You even wore a tie. I love a man in a tie. See, what did I tell you about the tie? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hi, Terry. Here's the man of the hour. BRENT: Hello. Hey. So what do you think? I... It's amazing I mean, I don't even know what to say, Mom. And, oh, the food, - Yeah. - Yeah, it... it's perfect. You know I don't wanna hold you back. You go talk to your friends. - Okay. - Okay. All right. Come on, I've got two I really want you to meet. You're gonna love them. Kind of surprised. I just missed being in Cameron's wedding. I'm so excited. Babe, this is Nate and Savannah. They're who I was telling you about. - Great to meet you. - You too. We've been dying to meet the guy who swept Cameron off her feet. Now I can see why she fell in love you. - Ah. - Aw. (MUSIC) Um, can I get you guys a refill? - Sure. - Yeah. Vodka Martini? - No vermouth, please. - Same here. - Be right back, babe. - Okay. Isn't he a love? That was really cute. He's great. (MUSIC) - So I was like, yeah. - Here we go. - Thank you. - Oh, thank you. - Yeah, that sure took a while. - Oh, the bartender messed up the order. He's trying to get, um, make that dirty Margarita that you like. Ooh. What's more, we had to spend the night in our car, because your wife had lost her hotel room in a poker game. - What? - Hey, that hand was not my fault. She was such a wildcat. But in the best possible way. - Oh, sure. - Yeah. Oh, who's that? LEXI: There they are. The happy couple. I'm so sorry, I don't believe we've been properly introduced. I'm his sister. I'm so glad we finally meet. Oh, my God. Brent, you didn't tell me you had family over here. You said all of your family and friends were on the West Coast. BRENT: Yeah. I did. How strong were those dirty Margaritas you guys had again? He doesn't really like to talk about me. I got all the good looks and social graces and Brent got all the leftovers. Oh, well, this is great. I guess now I finally get to hear all the stories about what this guy was like as a kid. I have so many stories that you need to hear. Excuse me. I'm afraid those stories are gonna have to wait. Everyone, dinner is served. Oh, great, I'm starving. BRENT: Yeah. What do you make of her? Brent told me he didn't have any family. CAMERON: Oh, this is a fantastic day. Can you agree? Oh, my God. I love this. I really... I really have always wanted a sister. LEXI: It's going to be great. We're gonna do all the fun stuff. Brent isn't one for mani-pedi nights, trust me. So what do we need to know about your brother? Any family secrets? LEXI: Oh, there's lots. Have you told them about Uncle Lloyd? Uncle Lloyd, no, of course not. You should. Why don't you tell them? He was our crazy uncle who would show up at inappropriate times and ruin family get-togethers. Isn't that right, Tara? Well you know, we all have that one crazy family member that no one wants to talk about. Would you, uh, excuse me? Oh, sure. She is a doll. Yeah. She's a peach. Um, excuse me. Well, that's some surprise, huh? (MUSIC) What the hell are you doing here? I wanted to see you squirm a little, let you know how it feels to be on the receiving end of some... How did you put it? Oh, yeah. Improvisation. Well, it's a stupid idea. You're gonna ruin everything. No. That's exactly why I need to be here. To make sure you don't. (SIGHS) Now I think it's time for dessert. (MUSIC) Do it. (MUSIC) I got the EpiPen from her purse. Did you get the one from the bathroom? One bite... and the money is all ours. Who's ready for cupcakes? I, uh, wanna say a few words, since my brother did some improvising with the wedding. I just wanna say that Brent has told me so much about his new family that I feel like I know you both already. Nicole, I know that you guys got off to a little bit of a bumpy start, but let's be honest, it's asking a lot of someone to have a man show up and say, "Hey, you've never met me before. But I'd like to marry your daughter." But from everything I've seen, you've welcomed Brent and today maybe me and into your family. And Cameron, keep an eye on this one. Excuse me for a minute. - Grace. - Oh, of course. I'll get the champagne. Pink is for the blushing bride. CAMERON: Oh. I just wanna say how glad I am Brent met someone like you, and that you're willing to put up with someone like him. So, here's to you, Cameron. Cheers. (MUSIC) (CHOKING) BRENT: Babe, what's wrong? Babe. (CHOKING) Babe. - Cameron? - Breathe. Breathe. She's in anaphylactic shock. Call 911. Grace, get her purse. I got it. I got it. Come on, just breathe. Breathe. NICOLE: Hurry up, Grace. It's not in here. The bathroom there's another EpiPen in the bathroom. (MUSIC) - It's not in there. - What? Did you check the side drawer in the kitchen sink? Yes. It's not in there. I must have forgotten to get a refill. Cam, stay with me, baby. Stay with me. Okay. 911 has been called. MAN: Your daughter was extremely lucky today. If there wasn't an EMT so close by, I think we'd be having a very different conversation. As it is, Cameron, you'll probably feel a little dizzy but there won't be any long-lasting effects. We should have you out of here in the next 24 hours. Thank God for that. What caused it? Most likely was something that you ate. But the caterer knew about her allergy. I was guaranteed that nothing would have any nuts in it. Then he screwed up. Well, it's not uncommon for there to be some cross-contamination in the preparation of food. But whatever caused this would've been a lot stronger than that. That's why it's imperative to keep an EpiPen with you wherever you go. - But there was one in my purse. - It wasn't there, babe. And I guess I forgot to replace the one in the bathroom. I'm so sorry, Cam. All right, I have a couple here that I could send you home with. For now, I want to keep you here overnight just to make sure that you're clear. Thank you, doctor. Very much. I know what you're gonna say. Don't pay the caterer? Well, we don't have to worry about that. Brent tore them a new one on the phone. It was amazing. He was relentless. (MUSIC) (PHONE VIBRATING) Oh, no. What is it? Grace says there's some emergency at the office. This late at night? - Any idea what it is? - It's probably nothing. (MUSIC) Hey. With all that's been going on, the party and now you getting sick, maybe when you're feeling better we could do something together. - Hmm, like what? - Well, I married you so fast we never got a chance to go on a honeymoon together. That sounds amazing. Everything okay? Yeah. I mean, I guess so. Went to voicemail, but I'm sure whatever it is, Grace can handle it. I'm gonna stay here with you, okay? No, no. I'm fine, plus Brent's here. And I can already feel whatever the doctor gave me kicking in. - Are you sure? - Mm-hmm. Let me walk you to your car. Good night, baby. You'll take care of her for me, won't you? Yeah, of course. Stay here all night if they let me. All right. I'll come back as soon as I can. (MUSIC) Don't do that. Give me one good reason not to. How about the 20 security cameras you passed on the way in here? You don't think somebody's gonna recognize you from the party that you crashed? You kill this girl in a sterile hospital, everyone's gonna look at me. And that $3 million is gone. All right, you two, visiting hours are over. Now scoot. If you think I'm going to sit through any more nights of you in bed with that spoiled bitch, you are dead wrong. Time's up. She's 25, the money is there, let's get this over with and move on. Is this some kind of game to you? I'm not the one who couldn't follow through on what needed to be done. What is that supposed to mean? You left that EpiPen in the bathroom. I had to pull it just like I have to do everything. I moved it. You left it there because you don't have the guts to go all the way. I've seen the way you look at her. You've never looked at me that way. You know that's not true. You switched the cupcakes. Because Nicole was suspicious. She already didn't trust me and then you show up after I told her I didn't have any family. I'll take care of Nicole. No. You've got to be smart. What are you suggesting? - A honeymoon. - What? Shh. Are you crazy? Trust me. You're not playing a role with me the same way you are with her, are you? You know I'm not. Prove it. (MOANS) (MUSIC) (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS) (MUSIC) Grace? (VACUUM CLEANER WHIRS) Evening, Ms. Winters. NICOLE: You said there was an office emergency. You sent me a text. No. I didn't send one. Look, it's... it's not even turned on. I must have powered it off when I put it in the charger. (PHONE BEEPS) There's no sent text to me, but I got one. Well, I didn't send it. Listen, sweetheart, it has been a long day. We had the party and the scare with Cameron. No. No, something really strange is happening. I spoke to Brent tonight, I asked him about his sister. He said, "I never told you that I was an only child." And I could have sworn that's exactly what he said to me. And then I'm looking through my phone trying to find a picture of Tara at the party and every single picture, her head is turned, like she didn't wanna be photographed. No, I think I got one. Here. And that necklace. Grace, that necklace. I was with Brent when he bought it. He told me it was a present for Cameron. Listen. Sweetheart, I'm gonna look into this for you, okay? Yes. And right now, I want you to make me a drink. Okay. Okay. You got it. Come on. Okay. Oh. GRACE: What about this one? No, that's not her. Here, try this, Tara Holvik, H-O-L-V-I-K. What's that? That's Brent's real last name. Oh, nothing on social media. Wait a minute. This is interesting. There's public record with an address, it's from few years back. That's right upstate. Oh, let me see what I can dig up on this address. Thanks, Grace. Of course. (MUSIC) (BIRDS CHIRPING) (CAR DOOR OPENS) (KEYS JANGLING) - Hi. - What the hell? What are you doing here? What is this? It's the house on the lake that "Rigo" is going to let you stay at before you kick off your dream honeymoon. That's where you're taking her. And whose house is this? It is a property held in trust by Rader's law firm. Don't worry, I confirmed that the owners will be out of the country through the end of the year. This is where we'll finally do it. Kill your wife. The property is right on the lake, it is the perfect place for someone to have an accident, get themselves drowned. It could take days to find the body, and then you legally get every last penny of that $3 million free and clear and then we get to spend the rest of our lives together. Right. So, first we have the Mont Saint-Michel on Saturday and we'll stay on the coast, before we travel up to "Paree." And if we're going to Paris, we have to see the Eiffel Tower. Oh, the Eiffel Tower? Come on. It's just so... Touristy? - Yeah. - I know. I know. But... Oh, come on, we're going all the way to Paris. Hey, I'm gonna honeymoon you all over France, okay? But first, I got a surprise for you. Rigo has a house upon the lake that he offered to let us use, so I was thinking that you and I could go there, just the two of us, before we fly off. All the people in all the world, and somehow I found you. I'm just lucky, I guess. KATHY: So we're gonna get started off easy, talk a little bit about your daughter, and you can go right into your sales pitch. Okay. Sounds great. All right. Let's get started then. Tara's updated address. I'm driving up there to talk to her. I wish I could go with you, but where is it? Rochester, it won't take long. I'll meet you for dinner and I'll call you if I find out anything. - All right. - Uh, do well. Drive safe. Safe is my middle name. All right, Nicole, let's get started. Okay. (MUSIC) (CAR ALARM CHIRPS) (CAR ENGINE STARTS) (MUSIC) - Hi. - Can I help you? Yeah. I'm... I'm looking for a Tara Holvik. I think she might be a nurse here. No. Not exactly. She's a patient. Are you a friend or family? Oh, a friend of the family. I... I know her brother. Okay. Follow me. Tara, there's someone here to see you, a friend of your brother's. You know Brent? Yes. Yes. I do. (MUSIC) Oh, hey, Nic, it's me. Listen, I... I just spent a half an hour with her. It's Brent's sister, all right. She's a long-term patient here in... in a wheelchair. She's needed assisted-care living for the last decade. So whoever that was at the reception, it was not Tara Holvik. (SIGHS) I... I'll just see you at dinner, I have a lot more than I need to... (GASPS) (HORN HONKING) If you are satisfied with your message and would like to send, press one. If you'd like to delete your message, press two. - (BEEP) - Yeah. (MUSIC) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Oh, bingo. (PHONE RINGING) Night desk, can I help you? Hi. Yeah. A friend of mine came in there earlier today to check on my daughter-in-law, Tara Holvik? Yes, she was here. Um, I was just wondering if maybe something strange happened? She was supposed to come back here and meet me for dinner and she didn't show up. No, nothing strange. She was here for about 30 minutes, and then she left. (SIGHS) Okay. Well, thank you very much. Bye. (SIGHS) (MUSIC) Shh. Get out of bed and follow me. (MUSIC) So do you wanna tell me what the hell is going on or do I have to guess? Oh, my God. What the... I did what needed to be done. She went and found your sister. I can't believe you killed her. She was going to tell Nicole. Nobody gets between us and that money. Now give me a hand. (GRUNTS) You have the tickets? You have the address. I'll follow you up tomorrow. As soon as the sun goes down, bring your wife down to the wine cellar. We'll need all night to take care of her body. Okay. Okay. (SINGING TO HERSELF) Good morning, sleepyhead. I made you breakfast. Uh, unfortunately, I got to run. - Oh. - Oh, but I'll take one to go. I just got to go over a few things with the contractor. When I get back, we'll be on our way. Ah-ah-ah. You are forgetting something. - I'll be back soon. - You promise? I promise. Okay. (EXHALES) I know, I spoke to someone yesterday and they said the same thing, that she can't be classified as a missing person for 24 hours. Yes. I know, but this isn't like her and... Okay. All right, thank you, officer. All right, I'll call back. (MUSIC) Hey. - Are you here? - Don't move. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey! It's me. Brent. What are you doing here? You're supposed to be on your way up to the lake house. I had to see you, I needed to do something first. Do what? I want you to know, before I go, exactly what I feel for you. I love you, Lex. After all this is over, I wanna make you mine for the rest of my life. Go see how it sparkles in the light. You just made me the happiest girl in the world. Oh. (MUSIC) I haven't seen Brent since the accident. The nerve damage just kept getting worse. I couldn't take care of myself anymore. That's how I ended up here. Like it wasn't bad enough already to lose our parents in that crash. Anyway a while after, I received a letter informing me that Brent was in prison somewhere out west. I don't remember what he was convicted of, but even after he got out he never came to see me. I'm so sorry. What about a, uh, a non-profit revamping infrastructure in the developing world. He said he was a contractor. Contractor? That doesn't sound like him. He also said he is friends with somebody who grew up with the Guatemalan president. Here's what I know about Brent, and I told this to your friend when she was down here earlier. He's dangerous. Be careful. Accidents happen to people who get too close to him. Where is he now? With my daughter. I love you. (BREATHING HEAVILY) Honeymoon itinerary. Got it. Thanks, Cam. (ENGINE STARTING) (BIRDS CHIRPING) BRENT: What do you think? CAMERON: Oh, my gosh. Great, right? I don't know what I was expecting but this is amazing. How much is Rigo charging us with this? It's all taken care of. This is the surprise I've been working on. (EXHALES) That view was incredible. And it's just the two of us. No distractions. Mm-hmm. What am I supposed to do for a week without Instagram? I am not sharing you with anyone, especially Instagram. Now, wait 'til you see the inside. (MUSIC) Oh. Oh, it's perfect. All right, save a little excitement. Oh, look at that fireplace. - You like it? - Absolutely. I want you to have yourself a look around and I'll go get all of your bags. Hmm-hmm-hmm, you're so cute. (MUSIC) Cameron, baby, you have to call me as soon as you get this. It's an emergency. I need to talk to u, honey. - Hey, close your eyes. - What? Close your eyes, cover them with your hands so you can't see. Okay. Keep them closed, no peeking. I'm not. - Okay. Open them. - What's this? It's a honeymoon present. Oh, I feel bad I didn't get you anything. Are you kidding me? Look around. This is the present you've given me and now it's my turn to give you one. - Open it. Open it. - Okay. It's a house. Our house. Wow. That's... That's amazing. (MUSIC) Hey, what is it? No, it's just, uh, I never knew how much two people could really love each other until I met you. I love you so much, Cam. And I'll love you forever. (MUSIC) Tara? What are you doing here? LEXI: Ha! Run. (GRUNTS) Where's my phone, where's my phone, where's my phone? (GROANS) (GASPS) Cam. Cameron, are you in here? Aah! I've had just about enough of you saying her name. (GRUNTS) Now I have to attend to your blushing bride. Just... rest easy 'til I get back. Aaah! Why are you doing this? You're Brent's sister. Right. You know, I have to admit. That's a little bit of a lie. Who are you? As far as you're concerned, I am... nobody. I'm nothing. What are you talking about? (GRUNTS) I'm talking about you, Cam. You know, my entire life I've had to fight. I fought everyone and everything that stood in my way. Teachers, counselors, the system. But it was never enough. There are always people like you. People who had it all. (SOBS) So I made up my mind to find some poor little rich girl and take everything from her. (SOBBING) Wait. You know how much money I have. Well, my mom has more, she'll pay you to let me and Brent go. Call her, she'll tell you... Anything you want. You and Brent aren't walking away from here, not after everything I've put into this, only to watch him throw it all away. All my work, coming up with every detail, studying your idiotic social media posts, training him to be the man you would fall for just like that. (SNAPS FINGERS) What do you mean? Oh, he didn't tell you? Everything with him has been an act. (BREATHES HEAVILY) LEXI: A lie. Now I'm going to make him suffer, the same way that he's made me suffer. And unfortunately for you, you're the button I push to make him hurt. (GROANS) (DOOR CREAKS OPEN) I don't care what Brent was before. I believe that he loves me, with or without the money. He found something with me that you could never give him, and that's what's driving you so crazy. I'm going to watch his face when he sees your dead body, right before I kill him too. It won't change the fact that Brent loves me, not you. Oh. Don't make this any harder than it has to be. You know, I would say it's been nice knowing you. It really hasn't. Unh! - Are you okay? - Yeah. - Are you hurt? - (CRYING) Okay. Look... Get your hands off of her! Give it up, Lexi. It's over. You're right. It's over for you. Listen to me. Okay, put the gun down, now. He didn't tell you? Right before he picked you up for this little love jaunt, he proposed to me, and then he tried to murder me. Because you were gonna kill her. And you think you can change that? You were always weak, right from the beginning I could tell that you didn't have it in you to go all the way but... I never imagined that you'd be tempted so easily. Think about it, okay, you kill me, and you don't see a penny of that money, right? You think that I still care about the money. I stopped caring about that the moment you left me for dead. Now this is personal, in fact... you could say that it's about love. I wanna know which one of us you love. Is it me or her? - Look, she loves me... - No, Brent. (CRYING) I hate you. Now, it's your turn. Please, no. Cameron. CAMERON: Mom. Well, isn't this a nice, unexpected twist. Stop it, don't touch her! Shut up! - Cameron, my daughter! - Mom. (CRYING) Brent! Brent! Brent, baby, please, please, look at me. Stay with me, stay with me, stay with me, Brent. (CRYING) I love you. Never forget that. Never. Never. (CRYING) Oh, who was that? - No one important. - Are you sure? Two department store contracts closing soon. They might be able to use you. Yeah. Well, they're gonna have to do better than this. Besides, we have very important business to tend to. Hmm, like drinking these delicious cocktails? Yes. And I noticed that very cute cabana boy over there making eyes at you. Uh. No. No. No. No. No, thank you. I have sworn off of handsome strangers - from now on. - Oh, yeah. Besides, my perfect traveling partner has been here all along. Cheers, Mama. (MUSIC)
