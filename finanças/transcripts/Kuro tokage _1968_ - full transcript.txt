A Shochiku Production I came here by mere chance. A friend said he would guide me to a secret club. This was a world unknown to me. Until a gaudy crime dragged me into it. BLACK LIZARD Starring: Akihiro Maruyama Isao Kimura Junya Usami and Yukio Mishima Original Novel by Rampo Edogawa Stage Adaptation by Yukio Mishima Screenplay by Masashige Narusawa Directed by Kinji Fukasaku This is an unusual night. An oppressive night... a night made for crime. I love a night like this. Sleep won't come easily tonight. And you? What about me? Do you dislike a night like this? You're a poetess. Are you a critic? Why? Beauty fails to intoxicate you. Your eyes tell me that. Really? A person like you... You're thinking of death, aren't you? "Despondent Young Musician Commits Suicide" "A Corpse Is Stolen From The Medical College Dissecting Room." The stolen corpse. Someone who died yesterday? Description? Age, 26. Height, 173 centimeters. Well-proportioned. This is interesting. A toy lizard. I wonder who brought it here. It's no mistake. A private detective - Akechi. Akechi? Does he suspect? I'm surprised to find you here. Anyway, listen to what this jeweler, Iwase, has to say. I'm Iwase. My name is Akechi. He received a warning letter. "Guard your daughter carefully." "There are people who plan to kidnap her." I'm sorry I've kept you waiting. Any new developments? Where's your daughter? She's with a customer in the Sky Lounge. Sanae, you've played volleyball, haven't you? How did you know that? I know everything about you. A beautiful, nicely proportioned body. I'm fascinated by the splendid curve of your breasts. You embarrass me. A pretty face means nothing without a good figure. You're the one who's attractive. Father says jewels suit you better than any of our customers. Don't flatter me. Whenever I see a pretty person, I feel sad. I imagine how she will look ten or twenty years from now. I'd like to preserve that beauty forever. People grow old because of anxieties and spiritual weakness. If there were some way to remove the soul... But without souls, people couldn't survive. It's just a dream that I have. Look into a diamond or sapphire. They're transparent throughout. There's no soul. That's why a diamond sparkles with eternal youth. Excuse me. Are you Miss Iwase? Your father says Mr. Akechi has arrived. They're in the bar. Do you think it's my daughter that they're after? I believe... that what they really want is my valuable Star of Egypt. Star of Egypt? A South African Diamond, valued at 120,000,000 yen. I see. Your hunch may be right. We must be very careful. This doesn't look like an ordinary crime. What? A threatening letter? A warning... that someone will kidnap me. How terrible! Father is very worried. He's asked for Akechi's help. Our coming to Osaka is really a trap set by Akechi. To lure the kidnapper to this place. What is it? You're so frank and trusting, I like you more and more. I'm an optimist. I think it's just a prank. How romantic! Shall we call Father and Akechi here? That's not necessary. Let's talk some more. There's someone I want to introduce to you. A young businessman from Tokyo. This is Yamakawa, the man I told you about. Miss Sanae Iwase. You just stand and gaze at each other? Fine! Young people don't need any words. You can remain silent while I do all the talking. It is night. The witching hour approaches. Hovering around happy homes are the ominous shadows of night. Yamakawa, why don't you show it to Sanae? The bridal doll you bought at a curio shop. It's so big. You needn't bring it. We'll go to your room. She's not there? Maybe she went back to her room. Wait! Take off her clothes. As I imagined. She would make a lovely doll. Father? You came back here? We've been waiting. I'm sorry. I didn't feel well, so I thought I'd go to bed. I'm sorry I disturbed you. Phone if you need me. Good night. Iwase! - Who is it? - Akechi. A telegram. "Watch out at midnight tonight" The kidnapper has set the time. The scoundrel! Where's your daughter? She's safe, asleep right beside me. Let's not wake her. She's sleeping peacefully. The bedroom windows? Locked tight since this afternoon. Excuse me. It's the sleeping pills. Will you lock the door and hold on to the key? I'll stay on guard in this room. That's fine. Leave this door open. Who is it? It's me. So! We meet once again! Was it you who was with Sanae earlier tonight? Why, yes. Are you here because of a strange telegram? How did you know? The bellboy is so talkative. Is Sanae asleep? Her father, too? Then, with you on guard here, there's nothing to fear? That's right. Isn't it a tiresome job? Danger usually exists in the midst of boredom. The white sheet of tedium suddenly smolders... to reveal a crime's profile. It's enjoyable to wait for its sudden appearance. But why are you so concerned with this affair? You'd better go to sleep. You're being rude. I have known Iwase longer than you have. I'm worried, too. Then, do as you please. I'll stay until midnight to watch the "smoldering." As you wish. A light? You're unable to sleep? When I first met you, you spoke of an oppressive night. A night for crime. "I love a night like this." "Sleep won't come easily tonight." You remember what I said? What crime did you mean then? I merely spoke at random. That's not how it seemed. Your professional relationship to crime must be... like a photograph and its negative. Your eyes see the same image and you think like a criminal. The only difference is that one is white and the other black. I'm afraid it's not as simple as that. To commit a crime requires a certain qualification. One that even the criminal may not be aware of. Qualification? Let's consider one woman. She receives a bouquet. Because she loves roses, she holds them close to her. Suddenly, a caterpillar appears from between the petals. With a cry, she hurls the flowers into the fireplace. She's not the criminal type. Take another woman. She, too, loves roses. Upon seeing the insect... she calmly throws it, alone, into the fire. Then she smells the flowers. Not the criminal type, either. Woman number 3? She'll neither kill the insect nor burn the flowers. In desperation, she goes to the man who gave her the bouquet... and pushes him into the fireplace. In such a situation she is capable... of rebelling against accepted morality. Society will call her a criminal. But of the three, she is the most tender-hearted. A splendid theory! I've never met a detective like you. One who has such a deep and romantic attachment to crime. Not for every kind of crime. My interest is aroused... by a genuine, gentle criminal, like Woman number 3. Time passes so slowly. Nothing has happened. We must wait. But, to tell the truth, it is rather tiresome. Look what we have here! What stakes? I'm poor. Not like you. I'll wager all my jewelry. A generous gesture. But I... There is something I'd like to have you wager. Don't scare me. Your... career as a detective. Agreed. Wonderful! It's my deal. This is trump. I've won this hand. Look. That puts me down 20 points. This is mine. Just take a look at this. Let's quit. The game isn't finished yet. Less than a minute to midnight. Do you trust the criminal? He must have pride. When you say that, it makes me feel worried, too. Is the time that he set more precise than... the schedule of a king? Nothing happened, after all. Was his watch wrong? I wonder. Akechi, I have a terrible fear. About what? Sanae may already... Have been kidnapped? Somehow... I have a strange premonition. Iwase! Your daughter! Is she really there? This... Where is Sanae? Sanae! Sanae! Akechi, what does this mean? Aren't you Japan's Number One detective? The work of a master criminal. I should have asked for police protection. Your fee is high. I expected results. The police... Wait! It's pointless to get unduly excited. The crime was committed before the telegram arrived. It wasn't a warning. It was the kidnapper's attempt to gain time... by keeping us here until midnight. Meanwhile the criminal has fled. For two hours a famous detective kept guard over a doll's head. What's so funny? We'd better call the police. Just give me a little time to think. About what, at a time like this? It's useless, Iwase, to ask such a question. Akechi is worried about the wager that he made. I bet all of my jewelry. Akechi staked his career as a detective. Now that he's been defeated, he's worried about retirement. I see. In 10 minutes? Make it 5. Be here in 5 minutes. I haven't lost the wager. I'm afraid you have. You're unwilling to accept defeat? Where's the criminal? I've caught the criminal. Are you dreaming? With those pretty eyes of yours? I've captured the dream. Your friend Yamakawa... who is actually Amamiya, who faked a suicide. I know where he went from here. Amamiya, alias Yamakawa, bought a ticket to Nagoya... got off at Kyoto... returned with his trunk to Osaka by automobile... and registered at a hotel... where he was to wait until you rejoined him tomorrow. And what was inside Yamakawa's trunk? You know, don't you? Well, so do I. My men shadowed him. They're real experts. They were told to phone. I've been waiting impatiently for the call. I see. I'll gladly accept all your jewelry. And Yamakawa? He managed to escape. You said you had caught... I have. But besides you and I... May I introduce the notorious Black Lizard? This is Sanae's kidnapper. What an awful accusation. Iwase, say something. I must say this joke is in poor taste. Make whatever excuse you wish. Before witnesses. Sanae! Sanae... I'm so glad! May I accompany you... to the police station? Thank you, but first, feel your coat pocket. I borrowed this to meet any contingencies. Raise your hands, everyone. Just like in exercise class. Akechi, this was your second mistake. Sanae, I must say, you're really beautiful. I love jewelry, but I'd prefer to have your body. I'll come back for it. Akechi, I'd like you to remember this. More certain than fingerprints. My crest. This "black lizard" on my arm. This is Akechi. Guard all hotel exits. A woman named Midorigawa. Got it? She's leaving. Be sure to grab her. She must not escape. Bring a passkey here. No one will recognize me like this. After all, I have no true identity. Isn't Akechi marvelous? Am I in love? No answer? All right. Tomorrow I'll ask another mirror in another disguise. Goodbye, then. IWASE Who are you? We brought the living room set that was ordered. The cover. Take it in! They've done a good job. Luxurious, isn't it? What kind of cloth is this? Genuine Nishijin brocade. A Nishijin necktie costs 5,000 yen. Is it that expensive? This may make Sanae feel better. Mr. Akechi is here. Who is this? Let me introduce Matoba to you. A former police detective hired as chief guard. How do you do? I see more guards outside. Black Lizard won't get near. How is Sanae? She won't leave her room upstairs. She's had quite a shock. A terrible experience. A professional... would have done better. I'll go say hello. Who is it? Akechi. You should turn it off. One can't play the piano while opening the door. Be very careful. Tonight is critical. What's more, I can't be here with you. Are you afraid? Yes, a little. But I trust you completely. Thank you. Right now, I must depend on your courage. What is it? Tea for the visitor. The sky grows purple as the sun sets. Monkeys adorn the cow with candles. Their sighing can be heard. Men are aflame. The sea is aflame. I've caught you! I... haven't done anything wrong. "The sea is aflame"? What are you sending by code? It's nothing like that. It so happens... That you're one of Black Lizard's hirelings. Who is hidden in there? What is the meaning of this? You, too? Who is it? It's me, Hina. I brought your medicine. Yellow Lion... Yellow Lion. The shroud of night... The pomegranate's rind is shattered. Help! Someone! What happened? Sofa... on the sofa! Whose hand...? In the bathroom! Matoba... Men... are... aflame. The... sea... is... aflame. Sanae! What about Sanae? Find her! Search the house. Outside, too. That sofa... It's covered with blood. Take it away! Change the cloth! Akechi! Call Akechi! Why isn't he here when he's needed. This was in the mailbox. "Sorry to cause such commotion. I have your daughter." "If you desire to have your daughter returned..." "I'm willing to negotiate, on one condition." "That is, in exchange for the Star of Egypt." Star of Egypt? So that was it. In any case, Iwase, you mustn't worry too much. Sanae will return safely. I promise you that. Black Lizard, you are an old-fashioned romanticist. In this age, soiled by corruption and murder... you believe that crime should wear a gorgeous gown... with a train 15 feet long. Just like the primordial dreams of lizards. Thank you, everyone. A complete success. A trick should be bold, childish and absurd. To trip a grownup requires a child's wit. Isn't that so? I'm sorry. You're grownups, too, aren't you? A crime is like a magic box... within which autos tumble and houses crumble. Those who think conventionally can never read my thoughts. That's right, Black Lizard. But Akechi... Silence! Not even Akechi. Look at what we did while he was asleep somewhere. Make preparations to leave. I assume Sanae is locked up safely. When she sees you, you must always appear as a bearded seaman. I understand, but when I'm near you, I want to be... Clean shaven? All right. I'm tolerant of other people's vanities. This fragrance... it's the same as that night. You were sitting in a corner. So young and yet you were thinking of death. The world seemed empty. I wondered how I should die. Then something soft touched my hair. These fingers. You looked so handsome. Probably more so than you ever did before... or ever will again. You had an evanescent quality from an inner shadow of death. I thought of killing you and turning you into one of my dolls. Dolls? How you fought when you learned that you were to be killed. Stop it! Your pleas... your tears... Please, stop! You ceased to be handsome. I didn't save your life out of sympathy. It was my amazement over your vow to become my lifelong slave. I've been a faithful slave. I've never betrayed you. No, but there were many blunders. Still, they might enable me to meet that man again. What?! Are you jealous? I am a woman. Whom I love is for me to decide. Ever since I first met him here, I've dreamt about Akechi. A vain man, who acts like a critic. When his face appears in my dream, it disturbs me. I've never before had such an experience. He looks as if he knew and understood everything. His eyes! His lips! He obstructs my dream. He pursues its form. He'll eventually become the dream itself. Go away. Leave me alone. Hurry! Like a black mist spreading in the room. There is a shadow enveloping me. Although he tries to capture me... he suddenly flees. Far into the night. Like a train's taillight... his glow remains in my eyes a long time. Pursued... or am I the pursuer? Pursuing... or am I being pursued? Good evening. I've read it. My "love letter"? The rendezvous is tomorrow? At Shinonome pier? The Star of Egypt... love's magic. Sanae... love's slave? A toast! To what? Tomorrow's rendezvous. The law... my love letter. The prison cell... my gift. And the final victory, of course, will be mine. "For your daughter's return." "The price: The Star of Egypt." "Time of payment: August 4, noon." "Place of payment: New Shinonome pier." "'Method: Shobei Iwase to come alone, bringing..." "The Star of Egypt to the designated spot." "- The Black Lizard." You've brought it? What about my daughter? She's fine. Can I trust what you say? You're attractive but you're also a swindler and a kidnapper. Father! Sanae... Sanae! Now do you believe me? You'll keep your promise? If you keep yours. The Star of Egypt! It's superb! You'll return my daughter? Before the night is over. Goodbye. Pursuers. Akechi...? They're stupid. Come in. Here she is. Stand guard outside. Do you feel all right, Sanae? Don't stand there. Come and sit here. Does this frighten you? In that case you can sit over there. Strange, you put up such a fight until yesterday. And now you're so quiet. Is there some reason? No special reason. The seamen say they heard a voice in your room. That's not true. I was gagged. How could I have spoken? True enough. In any case, it will all be over in a few hours. We'll arrive before sunrise. I have my private art collection there. I want to show you this wonderful museum. I don't want to go to such a place. Nevertheless, I'm taking you there. I won't go! You can't escape. We're on a ship. But I trust him completely. Trust him? Whom do you mean? Don't you know? Amamiya! Tie her. Gag her. Lock her in that room again. Wait! I want you to tell everyone. Search this ship from top to bottom. Akechi is hiding somewhere on board. Hurry! He's somewhere on this ship. Akechi! You've discovered me? Do I cling to you like a shadow? You're not afraid? Everyone on board is on my side. You're the one who's afraid. I'm not afraid. I'm amazed. How did you trace this ship? By staying close to you, I found myself here. Close to me? I was on one of the motorcycles. The goggles masked my face. Why didn't you flee with Sanae? You were bound to be discovered. I don't consider myself an expert swimmer. It's much more pleasant to lie on these warm cushions. Listen... I've been sleeping here since supper. It's tiresome. I'd like to see your pretty face. Can I get out? No, you mustn't. The men are liable to kill you. Just stay there. Are you protecting me? I highly value a worthy foe. What's going on? We're tying up Japan's number one detective. All tied up. Thank you. Will everyone leave the room? Akechi, the time has come to say goodbye. This will be your coffin at the bottom of the dark sea. Why don't you say something? Why are you silent? These are our last minutes together. Poor Akechi! Frozen with fear, and unable to speak, is that it? What a pity! This trembling, this violent shaking. As if you were struggling within me. But it's not meant to be. All that awaits you is death. Can you feel my kiss? Does my kiss reach you through the Nishijin brocade? A rain of kisses. For you... for you. The words that I speak may have sounded cold... but my lips are warm. As your body lies cold at the ocean's bottom... my kisses will be coiling around it like the red seaweed. Akechi, now I can speak freely to you at last. Never had I met a man like you before. I fell in love. When I was in your presence, my body trembled. I felt unable to do anything. Yet I cannot permit Black Lizard to act that way. I must kill. Not because you'll thwart my kidnapping. You understand? But I'm afraid of what I would change into if you stayed alive. That's why I kill. I kill... because I love you so! We're ready. Finish for Akechi. Back to your posts, everyone! Who's there? It's me, Matsukichi. I must apologize to you. I was fast asleep and didn't lend a hand. Yes, and you missed the burial. I don't know how to apologize. Never mind. I always turn to you for consolation. But now I want to be alone. Black Lizard... Are you crying? I...? Matsukichi, the sea is so dark. Except for that phosphorescence. In this world of ours, the age of miracles has passed. Do you know where we are? We've reached my art museum. I hope you like it. It'll be your eternal home. The Star of Egypt... here. Look at it, Sanae. A gift from your father. A brilliant adornment to make my other flowers bloom. Go and take a rest, all of you. Okawa, stand watch outside. Sanae, I have something more to show you. Come. Take a good look. Muscles of steel... hairy chest. Isn't this doll beautifully made? Maybe a bit too well-made, don't you think? There's downy hair growing on this body. Did you ever hear of a doll with downy hair? This doll... So now you know. At last you know. Sanae, this is reserved for you. I've wanted the body of a pure and beautiful girl like you. You'll do as I ask, won't you, Sanae? Into the cell! Quickly! Escape! Hurry! Help! Somebody! Come quickly! Put him in, too. A traitor. I'll make a doll of him. A new idea! The two together: "Joy of Love." We'll begin work at dawn. Well, then, good night. Wait! Matsukichi, I'm all alone in the world. After so much effort and risk. In the midst of these jewels that I've collected. I'm all alone... with no one to lean on. You can always count on me. You say such funny things. That's why I like you. I can count on you to make me laugh. I'd better get some sleep. There was no sleep last night. Wake me at sunrise. If I lay my head on a pillow for a while, I'll feel better. I'll sleep like a child. Are you... all right? You've recovered? Remember me? You're forgetful. It's the first time that I've ever seen you without a beard. What? You say you're Sanae's double? Akechi hired me to substitute for her. I had been jilted. I planned to die. Akechi saved me. I didn't want to pose as Sanae. But I finally agreed. I feel sorry for you. You're to become a stuffed specimen, too. Did you... love me? Enough to try to rescue me? I had no time for that. I'm Black Lizard's slave, jealous of everything she loves. A miserable slave. Akechi... your body... those dolls that she loves... all made me jealous. So, when she kissed that doll, I made a decision. To become one, too, so she would also caress me. Was that it? Just in order to die the way you wished, is that why... I pretended to help you escape. Then I needn't feel any sympathy for you? Just let me die my way. I'll let you do as you wish, but it's so very strange. Even though we're not in love... we'll be killed together the same morning. We'll embrace each other for all eternity. Our counterfeit love is destined... to take on the form of true love. The "Joy of Love." Eternally symbolized. Even if the Black Lizard were to kiss you... I'd be embracing you. Your eyes will gaze intently at me. It might just be possible... What? That we're in love, you and I. An illusion. I'm Black Lizard's slave. But after death? After death? We're destined to love each other. You'll no longer be a slave currying Black Lizard's favor. Nor will I merely be a substitute for Sanae. Who are you? Yoko Sakurayana. And you? Jun Amamiya. "Detective Akechi's Victory: Sanae Iwase Returns Home Safely" This newspaper is lying. No, this must be the truth. Who brought this newspaper here? The newspaper? I brought it. You! Then that Sanae in the cell... She's an imposter. Do you know what Matsukichi has done? He choked Okawa, and he's acting suspiciously. Punish him! Matsukichi... Are you a traitor, too? Not at all. I was just anxious about the dolls. The dolls? Don't make clumsy excuses. Check the dolls. Matsukichi! Here they are. They're both safe. Yoko, as I promised, I'm here to save you. Can it be? As for you two... As for us... I know all about it. Go wherever you want. Together. Hina, forgive me! Take them away. Open the door! You were alive. Poor Matsukichi... it was he who got killed. By your sword. You were alive! Meet your fate. I think you're horrid. You've taken... poison? Not because I've been captured. I know that. But because you listened unfairly to everything I said. It wasn't easy for me. A new experience. You're contemptible. You trampled cruelly on a woman's heart. I'm sorry. You were a woman criminal and I'm a detective. In the world of the spirit, our roles were reversed. You had stolen my heart. I searched for yours. I searched and kept on searching. I found it at last, and it's a heart... as cold as stone. But, you see... I, too... Don't say it. I want to die without hearing more. Yet, I'm glad. About what? I'm really glad that you're alive. I knew it all along. Your heart was a genuine diamond. A true jewel has been taken by death. THE END Subtitles Edited by H. Eisenman Subtitles by Cinetyp, Inc., Hollywood
