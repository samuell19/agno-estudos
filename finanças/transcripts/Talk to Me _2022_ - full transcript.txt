Duckett! Answer your phone. My messages are delivering, so I know you're fuckin' seeing 'em. Yo. Seen Duckett? Yeah, he's inside. He's fucking off his head. Bro, he's definitely on something, eh? Hey, is Duckett up there? Who the fuck is Duckett? Oi! Any of you seen Duckett? No, I haven't! Oi. Oi, seen Duckett? Cole! Get your brother under control. - Where is he? - He's in Jayden's room. Go. Dude, what's your brother's deal? Duckett! Open the door, man! I'm not screwing around. Mate, I'm this close to calling the cops. Duckett, open the door or I'll break it down. - What?! Dude, what the hell?! You're gonna break my mum's door! Nah, fuck this! Cole's breaking my fuckin'... Duckett. Can you see them? They're in here. I'm gonna take you home. OK, bro? Pop said you're gonna hurt a lot of people. Pop's dead, Duckett. You're not him. What are you talking about? Bro, look at Duckett. He's fucked! Are you serious? Put your phones down! Put your fuckin' phones away! Hey, hey, bro... Everyone fuck off! It's a knife! What are you doing? Get off me. Get off! - Mum! Sorry. No, I am. I just needed a moment. Your aunty wants to talk to you. Yeah, OK. I've still got her name in Contacts. I should take her out, but I just can't do it. Yeah, me neither. You thought about what you're gonna do when you finish school? Mmm... Work with your dad? You getting a cold, Mi? What? You getting a cold? Uh, yeah, I think so. How was today for you? - What? How was today for you? Fine. Hey. Hey, Mia. - Can you come pick me up? - Oh, OK, now? - Where'd you go? - I was on the phone. My sister was meant to be picking me up. My fat mum's meant to pick me up. She's probably off eating dick somewhere. Is that Alex? Yeah, his Snapchats are so cringe. He looks like my mum in half of 'em. - He looks elvish. - What's elvish? You know, like the fantasy elves. Shut up. I swear he stole one of my cigarettes. You smoke now? Nah, I just sell 'em. I sold, like, two to him today. He's such a tryhard. He invited me to his house to hang. I thought you hated him. Eh. Do you reckon they give you cancer straightaway? I don't know. Don't smoke it? Don't tell me what to do. Here you go. Nah. I hate the smell. You're a fuckin' foetus. I need a new best mate. Put it out, quick. Riley! You little feral. Cigarettes? We weren't actually smoking them. He's lying, Mia. - He's had half a packet. - Need a lift anywhere? Nah, Mum's getting here soon. Thanks, though. Alright. Call Riley if she doesn't rock up. Alright, thanks. Have fun with your cancer. - See ya, Mia. See ya, foetus! ♪ I'm gonna swing ♪ From the chandelier-ier-ier ♪ I'm ♪ Gonna live ♪ Like tomorrow doesn't exist ♪ Like it doesn't... ♪ - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. ♪ I'm ♪ Gonna fly like a... ♪ Um... stay in the car, OK? Oh, shit. You poor thing. What do we do? Do we call a vet? That's not gonna help, Riley. I mean, look at it. We can't just leave it like that. Can you at least put it out of its misery? OK. Mia, no, we can't leave it like this. Another car will come. Mia, it's crying. - Oh! Hey! Ow. Love it when you rock up uninvited. Love it when you forget to pick up Riley. Ow! I'm sorry. I had you on mute. Ah, cool story. I'm telling Mum. No, you're not! Yes, I am! Thanks for picking him up, Mi. All good. Come on, Cookie. Oh, God, you stink! Oh, you're a smelly girl! Saw a dying kangaroo. What? On the side of the road. It was in so much pain. Why didn't you call the RSPCA? I dunno. It was almost dead. I wanted to put it out of its misery. Thanks for ignoring my calls, by the way. I haven't been ignoring your calls. I've been busy. Uh, yeah, busy ignoring me. - No, Jade, don't. Don't! - What? Don't answer it! I let a kangaroo suffer. - Daniel... - I need consoling! Is that Mia? - I'll call you back, yeah? - OK, sure. OK, bye. Bye! Bye, Daniel! Bye! Oh! Alright. I'm consoling you. - Have you seen the group chat? - The one I invited you to? Hayley's video. They're doing it again tonight. - No, Mia. - To see if it's real! No, not tonight, Mia. I can't. It was Mum's two years. That was today? Yeah. I just want to forget about it. And... I need Daniel to come give my gucci some attention. Oh! Daniel's not touching your gucci, Mia! He was my boyfriend before he was yours. You guys held hands once three years ago. - That doesn't mean anything. - Jade. It's my mum's remembrance day. Please? Daniel can come, too, yeah? If he's touching my gucci, yes. - Stop! Can you give me five minutes? What am I gonna do for five minutes? Oh, I don't know. Wash Cookie or something! I don't wanna wash Cookie! Oh, fine! I will babysit Riley - the better sibling. Do not talk about your gucci with Riley, please. He has got to learn! The boy's got to learn! - Bye. - Miss you already. Bye. - Love you. "Can I help?" "Yes, Riley, thank you for asking." Need a hand? I'm sorry I couldn't get to your mum's thing. I couldn't get off work. No, it's fine. How's your dad? Oh, hey... You can be honest. I hate being around him. He's so depressing. I'm a bad person, Sue. Can you fix me? You're not broken, Mia. - Whoa. OK. Ugh, God, I'm dying. It's just a cold. You'll kick it. Thank you. Riley, get your shit off the table. Did you hear me? Yes, Mum, I'm coming. OK. Mum? You going to bed? - You sneaking out? - Why do you always think I'm sneaking out or I'm sleeping around? You only ask if I'm going to bed when you're sneaking out. Is it to see Daniel? You know, even if it was, he's ultra Christian. - He doesn't do anything ever. - He's still got a dick, Jade. Is it him you're sneaking out to see? I'm not sneaking out! OK. God. Night. Lock the door on your way out. - Are we sneaking out now? - Shh! Bye, Mia. - Oh, God! I didn't tell on you. What? I didn't do anything. What are you doing? Mia said I could come. How could I say no to him? - You're not coming. - Alright, then, I'll tell Mum. Yeah, well, she pretty much already knows. What, about you not picking me up? Whatever. - Yo, check this out. - I swear it's fake. - Mm, I don't know. It's 1,000 per cent a trick. How would Hayley fake that? Why would they? Why would they? They're an attention whore. They're trying to get everyone to talk about them and you've fallen for it. Sorry for ruining your phone date. Apology not accepted. You'll be pregnant next month, I swear. Pregnant? He hasn't even kissed me yet. What? You guys have been going out for, like, three months. - What is that? - Even I've kissed Jazzie.

You just need to loosen up. Brrr! Yeah, just do that. It looks incredibly normal. Brrr! Do that. Brrr! - Hey, Mia, brrrr! - Fuck, I love you. - Jade! Oh! - Daniel! Finally. Um, hi, ex-boyfriend! Group hug. - Hold me, ex-boyfriend. I am lonely. I am so, so lonely! You right there, woman? I'm sorry for dragging you out. Nah. I wasn't doing anything. I actually wanted to get out of the house for a bit. Wanna come grab a drink? I don't wanna do it. - They want you to do it. - I don't wanna do it. How you been? Dude, why'd you have to bring her? How you going, man? - Good. You? - Yeah, good, thanks. First, uh, big boys' party, huh? I don't really know anyone. You'll know everyone by the end of the night. Oh, good. - She's fine. - No, she's not fine. She irritates the fuck out of me. She's literally done nothing to you. She's so clingy, man. It's fucking depressing. Oh! Now she's flirting with your boy. They're friends, Hayley. You keep telling yourself that. Alright, let's do this! Yeah, let's fake another video. I've been waiting for this shit! Be pretty sick to hook the kid up. He's not doing anything, Joss. Come on, Jade. Imagine it, though. Joss, I said no. Huh. More for me. Thanks, bro. I guess, uh, I'll go first and... Nah, you always go first. It's my house. It's my fuckin' hand. Duckett gave it to me. You're a fucking hog! Does anyone else want to volunteer? I'll do it. You wanna do it? Mm-hm. - Wanna do it? - Yeah. - Do you wanna do it?! Sit down, Mia. Better her than me. - Tie her. Yes, sir. Hands up. Mmm, kinky. What are we playing? It's nothing, Riley. Hayley's tricked everyone. Alright, somebody time it. As soon as she lets it in, it cannot go for more than 90 seconds. Am I clear? What happens after 90 seconds? They'll want to stay. And if you die while they're in you, well, they'll have you forever. So lame. Hey, I'm just relaying what I've been told, OK? Oh! Fuck, dude! Trust me... it's gotta be tight. Candles? Light the candle to open the door. Blow it out to close it. OK, Mia. Ah... Put your hand on it. No, like, hold it. Now say, "Talk to me." Talk to me. Oh, my God! Oh, my God, what the fuck?! Who the fuck was that? Who was that?! I dunno, man. It's different every time. - Hey, you signed up. - Where'd he go? Mia, stop. No, you didn't do it right. You gotta say, "I let you in." No, I'm flipping out. Seriously, Mia, shut up. No, someone was sitting there, I swear to fuck. OK, I'm proving it. Attagirl, prove it! Prove it. That's right, say it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! - OK! OK. OK. Talk to me. Hey, don't let go, Mia. - Do not let go. - I can't look at it! You don't have to look at it! Just say it. - I can't! - Say it! I let you in. I let you in. I let you in. Someone timing it? Got it. There you are. Shh. Shh-shh-shh-shh. There he is. They like you. What? Oh, shit! Not you, though. Whoa. Yeah, Mia! He's behind you now. He'll split ya, pretty boy. He'll split ya! 83 seconds. Joss, get it off her. He'll split ya! - Alright, you've had enough. - He'll split ya. He'll split ya. He'll split ya. Run. Run. Run. Run. Run. Run. Run. Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! - Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! - 90 seconds, for fuck sake! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! RUN! RUN! RUN! RUN! RUN! Hey. Hey. You OK? We went a bit over. Hey. That was... amazing! That was the best one yet! Jade. Jade, are you up? You're not sleeping in here. I didn't even ask that. Isn't that what you want? No. I'm just bored. Look, Riley, you're not nine anymore, alright? Goodnight. Can you shut the door? Shut the door! - Sook! What a bitch. Can I hang with you? It's your house, bro. Did the hand thing scare you? A bit. You gonna have nightmares, Riley? I don't get nightmares. I do. Like what? I have this reoccurring nightmare... where... I'm looking in the mirror and my reflection is gone. Like I don't exist. What did the hand feel like? Mmm... It felt amazing. I felt like I was glowing. I could hear and see and feel everything. But I was in the passenger seat. It felt incredible. Mm. How did your mum die? You know. Only bits. She... took too many sleeping pills. By accident. Dad was sleeping on the couch. In the morning, he couldn't open the door. Mm. Why? Mum was on the other side. And there were scratches on the door and wood under her nails. She tried to get help, but she couldn't. Jade said you got depression after. I was just feeling alone. No, you can't ever be alone 'cause you'll always have me and Jade. Yeah. It's OK, I don't feel alone anymore. Wait. Oh, my God... - Is it being constipated? - Are you fuckin'...? He's won a million pounds! - You busy tonight? - You want a turn, eh? No. Daniel does. What's in it for me? My company. That's pretty cool, I reckon. No, we can't go to Joss's. His place is trashed. He's pissed. My house, then. I got a party later. I've gotta be gone by 11. Mum, leaves at 9, so... See ya at 10. Jog on. Yeah? Yes! Hi. Is Jade home? - Why is Daniel at the door? - Mum, can you let him in? You'd better not be having a party, Jade, I swear to God. It's two friends. Can you let him in? What time's everyone getting here? - Getting here for what? - The party. - Is there a party tonight? - Don't bullshit me. I'm... I'm sorry... Have you got alcohol in your car? Oh, no. I don't drink, so... You're good. What time's the party again? What party? The party. Jade told me. It's OK. What time? I honestly don't know what you're talking about. The party tonight. What time is it? There's no party, Mum. You are not drinking tonight. On God, I will punch you in the face. Are you drunk? James. If there's a party, I'm definitely drinking at it. Is that Cookie or you, James? Will you crack a window? Jesus, Mum. Knock much? Mia, if there is a party tonight, you are banned from this house, effective immediately. OK... So, you're just third-wheeling for the night, are you? It's really humiliating when you put it that way. You'd better not be getting stoned again, Mia. Oh, my God! Why does your mum have to know everything? I know everything. - I tried weed one time. You. My daughter's vagina - prohibited. Oh, my God, Mum! Leave the room before I kill everyone. The neighbours tell me everything. Oh, my God... - Watch it! Shut the door. Mum! I'm leaving it open! I'm so sorry. Ooh.

It's the hand of a psychic. Got cut off and embalmed. Legit. A medium, Joss. Not a psychic. Yeah, this isn't an embalmed hand. Yes, it is, Danny boy. The ceramic shit is put over it. But if you smash it, there's an actual hand in there. - You're full of shit. - I'm serious. Apparently it was the hand of someone who could connect with the dead, so everyone around him thought, let's cut his hand off. White people shit, man, I tell ya. Oi, I heard it was the hand of a Satanist. The other hand's just out there somewhere. Out where? Shut up, alright? - Fuckin' make me! - You just talk shit. Alright. Where'd you buy it? Oh, nah, I didn't buy it. A friend gave it to a friend and... yeah. - Who? - What do you want, Daniel? A fuckin' spreadsheet with a transaction history or what?

You're just so busy trying to suck Daniel's dick, you don't give a shit about anybody else. OK, no. Why do you want to do it so much? To impress James?

I'd never want to hurt you. I miss you so... so much, Mi. I don't want you to hate me. Mum? - Hey, that's 50 seconds. - Please don't close it off. Mia... - It's my mum. Please. I love you both, baby.

We just gotta get our story straight and make sure everyone sticks to it. Don't bring up the hand. Excuse me. We need to talk now, please. Mum, Riley's in hospital. What? What happened? He smashed his face really bad. What are you talking about, "smashed his face"? How? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know, I wasn't in the room! Stop crying and tell me what happened. Three or four minutes, maybe? I'm sorry, Mum. Jade! Jade, frickin' answer me! Can we talk about this? Mia. Dad, I just want to go to sleep. Can you tell me one thing? We didn't give him anything. What happened, then? I dunno. I wish you'd just be honest with me. Right, because you've been so honest with me. What's that supposed to mean? It means there's something you haven't told me about Mum. Isn't there? Right. Tell me he's OK. No offence, I don't want you here right now. Wait, Jade. Come on. Mia. Sue, I... Don't! What are you doing here? I just... I just came to see how he was. He's bad, Mia. He's really fucking bad. - Did you give him something? - No. Come on. I know you've done shit before. What was it? Nothing, I swear. Look at his face. What did my son ever do to you? I... I didn't hurt him. Go home. Now. No, please, can I just see him? You come back here, I'm gonna call the police. Sue... - Jade. - Just go home. No, Jade, I'm so sorry... Mum? Mum, is that you? Help me! - Mum? Mum? Mum! Mia! Mia. - What's wrong? Are you OK? Was your dad pissed? Yeah. I'm 18, so the police didn't call mine. They can't know. Where do they think you are? Cousin's. I can't go home. They'll know something's up. You can stay at mine. Just 'cause of me and Jade. It might be... weird. Yeah, but... we're just friends. It's not like it's illegal or anything. I just... I don't want to be alone. OK. I can't believe I spoke to her. I don't think that was your mum, Mia. No, it was at first. She used to call me 'Mi' all the time. I mean, how would the spirits know that? I feel like they read what we think. You know? I mean... they were in us. They could know everything about us. Or maybe... Mum was there because she was trying to reach out. We could check. I'm never doing it again, Mia. Sorry. Forgot about that. - I was such a loser. - You were cute. Remember when we held hands? Yeah. I could feel your heart beating through your fingertips. You paid me out 'cause your hands were bigger than mine. - And they probably still are. - No way. It is. You have the tiniest hands. Yeah, I... I didn't do puberty right. No, wait, Jade... Mum. What's your message to the haters? Suck my arse! Mm-hm! Mum! Get off me. Get off! Who's the cutest? Me. Me. - Me. - Who's the hottest? - Me. Who's the best? Me! Who's the funniest? Me. You suck! You suck! - Fuck the haters! Please... No. No, Rhea... Rhea... Daniel? Daniel! Daniel, wake up! Daniel, wake up! Daniel! Wake up! Oh, what the...?! Mia! - Stop! Where is she? Oh, my God, oh, my God! Oh, my God, they followed us. Whoever we contacted, they followed us. - What are you talking about? - She was sucking your foot! - You had my foot in your mouth! - What? No, I didn't. - I'm gonna go. - Wait, Daniel... - Mia, stop! - No, don't leave me! - No, I'm going. - Stay with me. Mum? Mum. Please, please, Mum. Talk to me. Mum. Did you... Did you kill yourself? No. Not on purpose, Mi. Is that the truth? I'd never want to leave you. Ever. I'm here. Always. Mia. Riley needs help. Oh, your father. Unbelievable. Can you stay with him, Jade? Riley. Riley, please say something. Riley? Riley. Mum! Mum! No, Riley, stop! Riley, stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Riley! Oh, shit! Stop! Nurse! Please stop him! Please stop him! Riley, fucking stop now! Fucking stop him! Do something! It was you who took it. You could've said something, Mia. Who showed the police the video? Think it was James. Least it proves we didn't touch him. Police said there's not a lot they can do. Has it ever lasted this long? No. But we've never been over 90 seconds before Mia, so... How is he? Every time he comes to, he tries to kill himself. They wanna keep him. What? The guy who gave Duckett the hand said that if you die while they're in you, they have you forever. Have any of you guys... still been seeing stuff? What the fuck you mean, "seeing stuff"? I saw my mum at the hospital. And another one attacked Daniel at my house. Did you see something? Uh... not exactly. What's that supposed to mean, Daniel? I woke up and Mia was... I dunno... sucking my feet. The fuck? Jade. What do you mean, "woke up with Mia"? What do you mean, "sucking your feet"? It wasn't me. - I couldn't go home. None of us have been seeing shit. We all did it. We were all there. Why would you see your mum? You didn't even let her in. Wait, didn't Duckett say they could imitate people? Wait, who's Duckett? I got the hand off him. He, uh... I met him twice at some parties and... yeah, we did the hand shit, I asked if I could borrow it and he said I could keep it. He said he was seeing them without it. And then he went full skitz. Stabbed his brother, then killed himself. The brother. Can we talk to him? What's up, bruz? What are you doing here? We gotta talk about Duckett. Yeah. Do you know what the shit thing is? He actually thought he had friends. You guys always inviting him to shit, acting like you cared. - But you were using him. - We weren't using him, Cole. A real friend would've seen it was fucking him up. - But you didn't. Look, bruz, I know it's a shit time for you, but we need your help. Nah, man, I'm out. Cole. I know how much it hurts to lose someone that close. The people he let in messed up his head. If he'd stopped doing that fucking thing, they would've left. My little brother's in hospital. He went way over. You let a kid do it? His body should kick 'em out. They get weaker the longer they're in. It hasn't. Give it time. They're killing him. Maybe it's time you stop fucking up people's lives, Joss. What do you reckon? Jade! Jade, just wait! Jade! You shouldn't have let him do it, Mia! We all decided it'd be OK. We didn't decide anything. We did. We all said... We didn't say shit, Mia. That was you. You let it go for two fucking minutes. You sleep with my boyfriend. What the fuck's wrong with you? - Jade, it wasn't like that. - Of course you take her side. Jesus... I wish that you didn't force yourself into my family, Mia. Um... Did we blow the candle out? I don't remember. What if we opened the door but we didn't shut it? What are you saying? We do it again with Riley but blow out the candle this time. You want him to do it again? The thing that put him in hospital? - You wanna save him? - Don't fucking ask me that. We have to do something, Jade! I'll give it back after, OK? Just burn the fuckin' thing. Hey, good luck. Mum's back in, like, an hour. We'll be quick. Oh, my God. Come on, Riley. Come on, please. Talk to him. OK, yeah, blow it out. Anything? I don't know. Um... Maybe if we just try it again. Mia... - Just try it again. Talk to him. It's not working. OK. Um... What if I use the hand to speak to him? No. - What? He's not dead, Mi. But what if his spirit is disconnected from his body? I thought these spirits were in limbo. - Maybe that's where Riley is. - Might not be him. - What if it is? - What if it isn't? This is a bad idea, Mia. Mia. Mia, don't. Riley, talk to me. Hi. Is it him? Is there a boy here? Him. Do you know where he is? Please. I can take you to him. OK. I let you in. Help! - Hey. Hey, hey, hey. You OK? No! Don't touch me! Don't touch me! Hey, hey, hey. Hey. - It's just us. It's just me and Daniel. What happened? I saw him. They're hurting him, Jade. They're not gonna stop. They're never gonna stop. Mia. I haven't been completely honest with you. But I want to be. Your mother... before she passed, she left us something. Something I've been scared to show you. Which is wrong of me. Because it's... it's just as much as yours as it is mine. Can I read it to you? "Dear Max and Mia. "It's Tuesday today "and it's raining. "It's the first time in a long time "I haven't felt hopeless. "In fact... "I am full of hope. "I hope you live beyond your years "and find absolute happiness. "I hope you... I hope you don't hate me for this." "I hope you find it in your heart to forgive me. "I hope you can find some peace in knowing "I am no longer in pain." I'm sorry, Mi. - It's hers, Mia. - No. It's OK. No, she didn't do it. She didn't do it, because she told me, Dad. She didn't do it, because she told me. She told me. She told me. - Mia. Mia. Come here. Sweetheart. - She's gone. I'm sorry I kept it from you. I didn't want you blaming yourself. It's not true. I'll be back. What? - I'll be back, I promise. - Mi... I promise. I just gotta... I'll be back, Dad. I'll be back. Mi. He's lying. Then why did you write it? I didn't. Sweetheart. That's not your dad. What? Mia? That's not Max. Mia? They're imitating him. He's going to hurt you. Mia, open the door! Riley can't stay there. Mia? - He's suffering, Mi. What... what do I do? He needs to die. What? Mia? You have to put him out of his misery. No, Mum, I-I-I can't. I can't. They're never gonna let him go. - No, Mum, please, no... I'll look after him, Mi. Open the damn door! Help him, Mia. Let me in! Help him, Mia! Just leave me alone! Mia! - Mia! - Help me! I'm trying! Mia! - Oh, my God. Hey. Jade? You OK? I know what to do. We can save him. You know, I actually think he's getting better. He woke up for a second. It's like he was himself again. I've seen him, Jade. He's in pain. And every second is agony for him. Just come to mine. And I'll show you. Show me what? You just have to be here, Jade. Please. - Just trust me. - Oh, shit. OK. I'll be there in 10. Mia. I'm... I'm sorry. No, it's OK. Sit. I was wondering when I'd see you again. You haven't come. You told me not to. I know. I was mad. You had every right to be. Still do. No, I don't. There were no drugs, Mia. He had a breakdown. I just... I just... couldn't face that. I'm so sorry that I blamed you. I know that you wouldn't do anything to hurt him. I love you guys. You're not Riley's friend, Mia - you're his family. It'd mean so much to him that you were here. Can I have a minute with him? Alone. Of course. I'm so sorry. Found me. Mia! I am ending this! You... can't take him. He's ours. Where is he?! You saw. Why don't you... touch me? I want to feel you. Max? Jade. Where are you? At Mia's. She's not here. - Max needs an ambulance. - What... No, Mia's here. What's wrong? What's happened? She's there? - Yeah, she's with Riley. Mum, she's dangerous! Mia? Riley! Hey! Where's my son? He was in this room. He should be here. He was just here. Well, where the fuck is he?! Mia! Mia! Riley. Mia! Mia! Riley! Mia, stop! Mia! I'm so proud of you. Take him, my darling girl. You're doing the right thing. Show him the way. I can protect him. We'll have him forever. Riley! ♪ I've seen the look in her eyes... ♪ Oh... Did you see what happened? Riley? I'm gonna be so far behind. Don't worry about it. Dad? Dad! Wait, Dad! Jade? Sue? - Dad? Dad! - Dad, wait!
