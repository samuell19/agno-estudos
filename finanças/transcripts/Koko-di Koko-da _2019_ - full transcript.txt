My rooster is dead... My rooster is dead... He will never sing koko-di, koko-da. He will never sing koko-di, koko-da. Koko-koko-koko Koko-di, koko-da. Koko-koko-koko Koko-di, koko-da... Sweetie, where've you been? We were worried sick! What's going on? Oh, honey-bunny... We went all over the place looking for you. Maja, don't you ever do this again, do you hear me? - Never run away from Mom and Dad. - Why would you do that? - Hello! - Yoo-hoo! Oh, isn't this terrific! Here we come! - You're blocking my view, dear. - Behave yourself, Helge. Oh, give me a push, Helge. - There we go... - We practically need a tow truck. Behave! This is lovely! Give me a hand. Hello, darlings. Wow! - You've grown! - You look great! There you are, here's a first-class hug. So nice to see you again. - I know what you want... - Helge, behave yourself. - Helge, look! Three little bunnies. - Amazing! - Their teeth are almost as big as yours! - Behave, Helge! Let's all go inside. And let the good times roll. - Come on. - Hurry up. - Last one in wins a year with my wife! - Behave yourself! - God, I thought they were coming over. - You love stuff like that! - Food for the bunny family... - Thank you. A Ricolina salad. An extra plate... Let me take that, honey. Thanks. Every day, Helge and I applaud the sundown. But he has one more claw! And now they're both hurting! Okay... Let's stay like this all day long. What's wrong, dear? I don't feel very good... Let's have a look. - Jeez, you're all red. - Really? I feel strange... Mommy? Mommy? Sweetie, Mommy needs to be alone right now. Oh, my God... My wife needs help! You mentioned mussels, is that what you think triggered this? - Have you ever had mussels before? - Yes, without any reaction like this. But these tasted kind of strange. Allergic reactions are fairly common... ...the 2nd, or even the 20th time you consume shellfish. - So the first time might not trigger it. - Really? I had no idea... Hi... I'm hooking you up to a drip. There... That's great! Nice... Elin, could you do a "I didn't sign up for this" expression? Hang on, Maja. Back away a little, okay? Excellent... Great. Shit! Are you okay? Are you feeling all right? Sweetie... If you start feeling strange at all, tell me, okay? - Promise? - Yeah. She ate some too, we shared the pizza... That's enough, Maja, bring it back down. - Give that to the nurse, okay. - Hi, my name is Helle. All right if I borrow this? - Is that a birthday present? - Go ahead, tell her. - It's her birthday tomorrow. - How old will you be? Eight years old! That makes you a big girl. - Do you know what's inside? - Your present... - A music box. - Sorry, my Swedish... - A music box, you crank it and it plays. - I see! What a nice present. Of course you can't be certain that it is a music box... Not until tomorrow. If it had been me with that rash, I would have been scared stiff. I wasn't really worried until you freaked out in the restroom. You just went "fuck!" Come on... You were so damn scared and that scared me. You could have toned it down. It made me so nervous. Seriously, my wife goes into the stall and out comes someone else! What do you expect? I panicked. Yes, but you should have kept your cool. That just stressed me out. In goes my wife, and out comes Freddy Krueger. Hi... Check this out... I got it at the cafeteria. Shit! How do you turn it off? "Pling-pling"... Do we do it in Danish or Swedish? "With lots of chocolate..." Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you... Cheers for Maja! Hip, hip... Hooray, hooray... Maja? Happy birthday, honey bunny. Maja? Maja? She's cold... Turn her over. Sit over here! - Take the blanket off... - Maja! Where's the alarm? Find the alarm button. - Hold her head up! - I'm trying to. Maja? Maja? Help! We need help in here! Maja, Maja, no! No, no, no... Hang on, we need to... Hello! Get in here and help us! Maja! Maja! Help us! She's not breathing! She's not breathing... Maja! Get someone who can help us! 3 YEARS LATER That looks so bad... Wearing your hair long when it's thinning on top. This isn't what I wanted. Oh... Then what kind of ice cream did you want? If you had paid attention, you'd know that. - I thought you liked strawberry. - Whatever... Are you really upset about this ice cream thing? I'm angry because you didn't pack my swimsuit. I did pack it. Why didn't you just say so? Do I have to ask three times? Is forgetting your swimsuit such a big deal? Big enough to lose your temper? Red light. - Why are you turning back? - To return your ice cream. - I've already had some of it... - Calm down, I'm just taking the highway. Why don't you say what you actually mean, for once? You're always joking... I love you. It's not here, I already told you that. You're letting the mosquitoes in! And I've already looked for it there. - You could help me out, you know. - No. I don't want to. Then you just might have to sleep straight on the ground. And I just might not ever want to camp again. Do you think I want to? Do you think I want to go on another vacation ever again? Just tell me when you're done. Damn... Tobias... Tobias, I need to pee. What? I'll do it under the flysheet. No, come on! But there are so many mosquitoes. Get a grip. Hello, kitty... What have we here? A little lady? Good morning, ma'am. It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance. Tobias! Tobias! Hush! Be quiet! Easy does it... We're only playing. You see? Dance! Just dance. What a big tent for such a small girl... But maybe it holds a nice surprise? Yeah, go for it! Come on! Yeah... Elin! Stop it! Stop it, Sampo! Easy... Easy now... Take a really deep breath. All the way down... Take a deep breath and relax. Just relax. Picture the bullet leaving the barrel, going all the way through. Slowly, slowly... Slowly. Perhaps... No, no... This is my vacation, you know, and I want to be able to relax. The next time we reach a B&B... ...promise me you'll stop. But we decided to camp. Is this about money? I'll pay for it, if you're such a cheapskate! If we come to another B&B, promise me you'll stop... - Could you promise to stop? - No. Then drop me off. Calm down, it only takes five minutes to put up the tent. You don't even know where we are, you just keep on going. I do too! Besides, it doesn't matter where the hell we are. I can pitch that tent anywhere. Even in some goddamn cow pasture! What are you doing? What...? - You can't just turn off wherever! - Sure I can. We have the Freedom to Roam Act. I'm not going to camp at a site that isn't meant for it. For God's sake, all you need is one square meter of level ground. And a tiny drop of positive energy. This isn't even a road. Sure it is, I'm driving on it. That's the very definition of a road, that you can drive on it. It's for tractors, not cars! Slow down! What the hell? A pussycat... There. This will do. Tobias... Tobias? - I need to pee. - What? - I'll do it under the flysheet. - I had this dream... I can't remember it, but it was creepy. Is it all right if I don't go outside? There's so many mosquitoes. Get a grip... Come on! Listen, Elin... - Yes! - Go on, pee inside. Could you make up your mind! Stay under the flysheet but be quiet. Someone might show up. And turn off your flashlight. - Hush! And turn that off! - I can't see a thing! Want me to pee in a saucepan or what? Well, good morning! No, no... Let us have a look! Bon app√©tit, my friend. Why not head directly for the source, and kiss that little pussycat? Come on... Kiss the pussycat! Yummy, yummy yummy, I've got love in my tummy. So, where's your knight in shining armor? Your hero, where is he? Huh?! Attack! Yes, attack! No luck of the chase today, huh? Say, where is that gentleman of yours? Guess no one's here... Let's move on. Don't move! Watch out, my friends. Casper, the Friendly Ghost, is after us. You tiny, friendly ghost... Come on, stop it! Better be quiet... There's a gun pointed at your balls. Stop it... I told you to shut up! Goddammit... Is that understood? A Casper without balls is not a real Casper. A tiny bit more... Yes! What are you up to? It's mating season, you know. Stop it... Can't you tell I'm horny? Tobias... Tobias? I need to pee. I think there's somebody out there. Be quiet... Stop it. I can't hear anything. What's wrong? - Switch that flashlight off! - What are you doing? What's going on? Did you have a bad dream? - Tobias! - Be quiet! What are you doing? - No... - So now we're not staying in the tent? Be quiet... Shut up, go back inside! Inside! Hey... What are you doing? Knock it off! Stop it! No... No... No! Tobias... Tobias? I need to pee. We've got to go! - Now! - Stop it... Ouch! Let go! It was only a bad dream... - Get in! - I need to get my stuff. They'll be here any second! Stop it! - You can go back for that later. - Let go! Get that later. Get in! - Tell me what's going on! - Get in! Could you pull over? You'll get to pee, just calm down. I'm practically wetting myself! Stop the car! Well, good morning! Tobias... I need to pee. Hey... Fucking car! - Get out! - Ow! Now. Move it! What the fuck? Tobias, stop it... - Come on! - Ow! You're out of your mind! No!
