Dr. Fletcher. As long as you have elected to take the stand at this inquest, I again urge you to give us more information regarding the circumstances surrounding the death of the deceased. You are being of no help to us by your continued silence. It's very obvious, Mr. coroner, that Dr. Fletcher has no intention of cooperating. The fact remains. The young woman was found murdered in the grounds of his sanitarium. Evidence plainly indicates that he killed her. Doctor, surely you must realize that this persistent refusal to speak will only condemn you. I told you, I killed her. Well, even though you admit your guilt, there may be extenuating circumstances. If there are, we'd like to hear them. I hesitate to speak because to you, Mr. district attorney, my story would border on what I am sure you will think fantastic. Why so? Not being a scientist, you wouldn't understand. As a member of the profession, in fact as a colleague you might say, I might understand. Well, evidently there's nothing more we can do. Why waste time, Mr. coroner? Please, father, you must. Very well. If you will bear with me, I shall try. In order to do that, I must take you back some time. Ladies and gentlemen! You are now about to witness one of the most spectacular acts ever performed in any circus. The most deadly enemies of the jungle, lions and tigers, mixed together in the same arena. These ferocious beasts, which until a few months ago were roaming through the jungles, are now brought together for the first time by a man who will make them do his every bidding. And now, ladies and gentlemen, Fred Mason! The human attributes of that animal so impressed me that I persuaded the owner of the circus to turn the body over to me for research. Although the ape was pronounced dead, I detected a faint respiration and rushed the body to my laboratory. How did you sustain life in the animal, doctor? I injected adrenaline, probed for the bullet. After a few hours, the ape showed improvement but no animation. Having restored life, I continued further experiments. Until one day, Fred Mason came to see me. Which of you is Fred Mason? Here, sir. Just as Dr. Fletcher says, I did call on him. Just a moment, Mr. Mason. If you have anything to say, please take the stand. Please raise your right hand. Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth in the matter now before this coroner's court? =t do. Tell us your story. I happened to be in the vicinity of Dr. Fletcher's office one day. Dr. Fletcher, I'm happy to meet you. I heard that Sheila the ape was still alive. I was in the vicinity and I took the opportunity to call, perhaps see her. Well, I'm happy to have you. Won't you sit down? Thank you. Thank you. So you were Sheila's trainer, eh? I'd like to hear more about her. Well, I found her on one of my expeditions into the Belgian Congo. You know, the natives told me a story of a doctor further back in the interior who'd been experimenting with turning human beings into animals. I was never able to trace the story down but the natives insisted it was true and that Sheila was the result of one of those experiments. There have been many efforts made in that direction, as well as giving animals human qualities by means of various serums. Well, in any event, Sheila was the smartest and certainly the most affectionate creature I ever took out of the jungle. Her fondness for you was quite evident the night she saved your life. Oh, did you catch the performance that night, doctor? Yes, I did. You know, it's a funny thing about Sheila. You're the second doctor that's been interested in her. Really? Who was the other? Dr. Walters, who offered to buy her for his research work. It was about that time she disappeared. What happened to her? T don't know. A short time later, the same Dr. Walter showed up at our winter animal training quarters with a young lady. He introduced the young lady as a patient of his. I recall I didn't pay very much attention to her. I went back into the cage to work with the cats. Okay, bill, let in the tiger. What are you gonna do? Her influence over animals was phenomenal. I pleaded with her to join the act as my assistant. I knew we could make circus history. She consented. Then one day while we were rehearsing. The dress rehearsal came off beautifully, everybody was excited about it. Beth, my wife, she was my fiancee then, came to congratulate me. T never realized at the time that the girl was insanely jealous. All this affected my wife much more than it did me. Mrs. Mason, would you care to take the stand? Raise your right hand, please. Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth in the matter now before this coroner's court? =t do. Tell us what you know about the deceased. The girl frightened me. There was a peculiar something about her I couldn't understand. Something that made me feel all tied up inside. Then strange things began to happen. Just like the time when I was asleep one night and a peculiar, weird looking figure came into the room. The next day, while discussing it at the office with Fred. Fred? You know, there was something familiar about the face of that woman or whatever it was I saw in my room that night. Who do you think it was? This may sound fantastic but I think it was Paula. Paula? Why, that's ridiculous. I'm not so sure. It all seems to tie in. They said that woman was killed by a claw like grip. Gruen was killed the same way. It all points to cheela and yet I'm certain I saw Paula's face that night. Yet it was the face of a... now wait a minute. You're not trying to connect cheela and Paula, are you? You said time and again Paula had a way with animals that was unnatural. Oh, well, look, honey, you're letting your imagination run away with you. Take it easy. Fred and I never spoke about it any more. Even though he dismissed the whole thing lightly, still it stuck in my mind. Did you ever discuss this with anybody else? Yes, my husband asked me to come over and talk to Dr. Fletcher. And you told this whole story to Dr. Fletcher? Yes, it's odd. His friends are not scientists vet they all seem to agree with him. Every thought seems to imply that the girl and the ape were one. Mr. coroner, I'm an average man I and as such I can accept a certain amount of fantasy but... I didn't expect you to understand. If you remember, I said as much. Yes, yes, you promised it would be fantastic. Dr. Fletcher, will you take the stand again? Dr. Fletcher, you told us a while back that you wanted the ape for experiment. What did you hope to gain by such an experiment? Much useful knowledge in the study of glands and their effect upon the human body. Well, then why if you were so tremendously interested in your research did you interrupt your experiments to change your quarters to the crestview sanitarium? That was hardly an interruption. We scientists sometimes play hunches too. Shortly after my talk with Fred Mason about Dr. Walters and cheela, I began to wonder, how far had Dr. Walters gone with his experiments? What was he after? What did he attain? I found this challenging. So when I learned that the estate of the late Dr. Walters was being sold, I purchased his splendidly equipped sanitarium devoted to glandular disturbances. After nights of incessant laboratory work and days of poring over reference notes and index files, slowly I realized I had allowed myself to stray into another man's province. And I decided that I could accomplish more by devoting myself to my own practice and research when suddenly. Dr. Fletcher, Dr. Fletcher. It's gone, the ape's gone. What are you saying, Willie? You oughta see the laboratory. The operating table's turned over, bottles smashed, and everything thrown 'round the place. Willie, I warned you several times to stay away from that animal. Now look what you've done. I didn't do nothing, Dr. Fletcher. I only went in to see how she was feeling and when I got there, the back door was open and the ape was gone. Well, she must be somewhere on the grounds. Come on, Willie, we'll go and look for her. We searched every building and every inch of the grounds, to no avail. There was no sign of the ape. I was both startled and surprised to see Willie approaching with a young lady. Hey, dr Fletcher, look. Look what I found. Ain't she beautiful? Well, well, yes, but what is the meaning of this? Who are you? What is your name? She won't talk, doctor. She won't say nothing. Maybe she's one of the new patients, huh? Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, this place is getting better all the time. Now that'll do, Willie. You go to your room. T seen her first. That's true, Willie, but it's late and you should be back in your room. Oh, it's a gyp. You better come inside with me. We went to my office. I wanted to help the girl. I tried to find out who she was, where she came from, but I was unable to obtain any information from her. I thought her peculiar behavior was probably due to shock. Still, her eyes were alert. Her wrist felt cold, clammy, and yet her pulse was normal. There was no way of knowing then if her silence was forced or whether she was a victim of toxic or mental disturbance. Usually the eyes will respond to a question. Still, the girl would not reply in any way. Perhaps I'd better call miss gray, the admission nurse. Because if you're not a patient here, I must notify the authorities. This is inconceivable. Yes? Excuse me, Dr. Fletcher. I told them you were busy. Oh, Joan. Hello, Bob. - Hello, sir. It's my fault. I can never refuse joanie anything. Used to do a lot better for me in the old days before father got hold of this place. Why, the idea of letting him forget an appointment with me. I'm sorry, Joan dear, but I've been very busy. It's bad enough you're missing the varsity show but not a single letter in weeks. Yes, yes, I know, but I got myself involved in some research. Well, that's a good excuse. Isn't it, Bob? Father deserts only daughter. You know, I have a very good case here. I could have your parentage annulled. Oh. If I wanted to. I hope you'll forgive my barging in like this but Joan invited me. Oh, glad to have you, my boy, anytime. Thank you. And can we have cottages one and two? That I suggest you take up with miss gray. Hello, my name is Paula. Hello, Paula. That's odd. That's the first time she's shown interest in anything or even spoken a word. Hey, what goes on here? Well, she's a patient of mine, Joan. Suffering from amnesia. Maybe Bob could help restore her memory. Yes, yes, but now miss gray will see that you're both comfortably settled and I'll look in on you later. Now if you'll excuse me. Coming, Bob? Yes, sir. Excuse me. I'll see you later, son. - Yes sir, good night. - Good night. Hello. I brought you something nice to eat. Go away. Oh gee, I only... Go away! Look and see. It's awful good. Now you know, Willie, Dr. Fletcher warned you not to go near Paula or to annoy her in any way. I don't annoy her. I was just bringing her lunch. It's the third time you've stolen a tray from the kitchen. I was just trying to be nice to her. Oh, never mind, Willie. I'll take the tray, go back to your own room. Oh, it's a gyp. Come, Paula. Don't let your lunch get cold. You didn't touch a thing for lunch, Paula. Not even a bit of your dinner. Good evening, Dr. Fletcher. Good evening, miss gray. She's a bad girl, doctor, she won't eat. Well, this won't do at all, young lady. But we'll talk about that later. Sit down, Paula. I'd like to try another little test with you, Paula. Somewhat different than the one we did yesterday. This may be more difficult but we'll see how it works, shall we? Now here's how it goes. I say something to you, leaving out a certain word, and you are to tell me what that word is. Do you understand? Yes, Dr. Fletcher. All right, now this is just for practice. I say if a child loses his balance, he will what? He will fall. Good. Now you have the idea. We must do this within a certain time limit. So are you ready? The sky is what on bright days and what before a storm? The sky is blue on bright days and dark before a storm. Good, very good, my child. Now strange noises make a dog what? A happy cat will what? Strange noises make a dog bark. A happy cat will purr. Oh, making excellent progress, Paula. Now we go to one more difficulty. Well, here goes. Hey, aren't you coming with me? Well, darling, I was just thinking, maybe it would be better for you to talk to father alone, sort of man-to-man. Nothing doing. When I break the news to him, you're gonna be right beside me. Scaredy-cat. Take that back. Bob, I've been waiting for you. Have you? I've been sort of busy. But you're looking very well tonight and very pretty too. Don't overdo it, darling. Bob, may I speak to you a moment? Certainly, sir. Here's your chance, Romeo. Make the most of it. Excuse me, Paula. Now son, I don't want you to misunderstand but if you remember when you first met Paula, I told you she was a patient here? Yes, I understand. But do you? What are you trying to tell me, Dr. Fletcher? I feel it necessary to emphasize the fact that you must avoid Paula. I don't get it. All I did was to be polite and humor a little. Yes, yes, I understand, but to one as emotionally unstable as Paula, any such kindness or attention might invite danger. Are you serious? I'm so serious that I've come to the conclusion that she must be isolated completely. T never dreamt. As a matter of fact... Lovely summer night, isn't it? Did you ever notice when you look up at the sky and keep watching it long enough, its color seems to change from a black to a brilliant blue? What is it? What happened, Joan? I don't know, it looked like a hideous shadow. I'm surprised that you're afraid of shadows. Where's Paula? I don't know, I was just talking to her and she suddenly disappeared. Yeah, well, she probably went to her room. I'll go and see. Look after joanie, Bob. You bet I will. Let's get away from here. How about the lake? I saw you, Paula. Don't try to hide from me. Oh, come on out. Willie won't do nothin' to you. Hey, Paula, I know where there's a boat down by the lake. You and me can go rowing. Huh? The moon is shining so nice. Oh, come on. Gee, Paula, I don't khow why you want to run away from me. Oh, don't be mad like that. Go away. Oh, Paula. Don't follow me! I'm lonesome. I just want to be near you so I can talk to you. Look, I want to tell you. What's that, I wonder? Listen. It's in the woods. Some animal must have disturbed the birds or something. You know what, Joan? What? If I were god, I'd give every Joe like me a canoe, a lake like this, someone like you. If I were god, you know what I'd do? What would you do? I'd give every girl like me a magic power to take each wonderful moment like this and dust it with everlasting life. You forgot something there. How clear and bright the stars are. Do you believe they shape our destiny? Well, having flunked a course in astronomical trigonometry, all I know is they're up there just to shine down on us, whisper as they wink to me. Tell her you love her, you goon. That's just what I mean. Bob, Bob! Swim to the boat, Joan, swim to the side of the boat. I can't, something's pulling me under! Hold on to me, Joan. Everything's all right. Grab hold of the boat. What on earth happened? It's just an accident. Something was trying to pull me under. You must have gotten tangled up in some of the reeds. No, Bob, I know I felt someone pulling at me. Joan and I talked it over and we decided the best thing to do was to come and tell you about it. Tell me about what, son? Well, that spill we took in the lake last night was ho accident. Really? What makes you think that it wasn't an accident? Well, I didn't want to worry Joan about it so I made believe it was. But I've handled canoes since I was a kid. This may sound kind of silly, sir, but I'm positive that while we were drifting, something or someone grabbed the canoe and deliberately tipped us. That does seem strange. But we didn't tip from the side, the way a canoe usually does. That's right, dad. We were on even keel when we were dragged straight under, dragged straight under. To do that takes someone with terrific strength. Dr. Fletcher, may I speak to you for a moment? What is it, miss gray? Have you seen Willie? No, I haven't, but why should... He's missing. Willie, missing? He's been gone all night. You say that you were dragged under by someone with great strength? Yes, sir, it would have to be. Why, I can hardly believe it. He's such a good-natured lad. Do you think that Willie did it? T wonder. That you, Bob? Yes, sir. I've searched everywhere, sir. But not a sign of Willie. Well, I can't understand it. Joan! Joan. What is it, dear, what's wrong? Someone or something was peering through my window. Oh, you're perfectly safe here, child. Now tell us, what was it you saw at your window? I don't know exactly. Could it have been Willie? Oh no, no, I don't think so. It looked more like a, like a animal. I was so frightened, it broke me out of a deep sleep. It's all over now, dear, it was just a bad dream. Oh, but it wasn't a dream, I tell you. Don't you understand? Bob, stay here with Joan, I'll be back soon. Paula, Paula? Js a riding we will go, a riding we will go j j high-ho the merry-o, a riding we will go j js a riding we will go, a riding we will go j j high-ho 7 what in the world? Take me away from here. Take you away? T don't understand. I'm afraid. Afraid of what? Of Dr. Fletcher. Well, that's incredible. Why should you be afraid of him? Look. Are you trying to tell me he did that? Yes, but why? I don't know, but please take me away. I can't very well do that but I can have a talk with Dr. Fletcher. I wondered what had happened to you. We were to go riding at 10, remember? Yes, I'm sorry, Joan. Oh, come in. Paula wants me to speak to your dad about something. Why not? What's a few secrets among acquaintances? But tell me, is this the latest in closed-door diplomacy? Candidly, it is a private matter. I'll see what I can do, Paula. Thank you. Oh, you've let me down, Bob. Joan, I... That explanation of yours isn't just lame, it's hobbled. Stop acting like a little fool, Joan. I'm sorry I'm not more amusing. If what Paula says is true, it's not amusing. It's serious and embarrassing. I'll say it's embarrassing. For me too. Joan, wait. I can't figure it out how anybody could be strong enough to pull lock hinges and all right from the door of that chicken house. I never heard anything like it, not since the destruction of gehenna. Dead fowl all around the place. You mean to say they all were killed? What wasn't dead was gone. The sight I've seen, doctor, I wouldn't believe it if I wouldn't have seen it with my own eyes. It must have been a terrific struggle. All those animals and all crushed pretty near the same way. Worst of all, Daisy, my Shepherd watchdog. Oh, that's too bad, George. But tell me, do you think Willie could have done all of these things? I don't know, doctor. Must have taken a pair of pretty strong hands to rip this thing out of its place. I don't know, I can't say. Paula. What are you doing? I am going away. Ridiculous, you're not going anywhere. I am leaving. But before I go, I'll... Dr. Fletcher. Don't misunderstand, son. T think I understand. I'm sorry you had to see this, Bob. I'm sorry too, sir. Go to your room, Paula. Bob, I want to speak to you. That will have to wait, Dr. Fletcher. Are the prints blurred? No, they're clear enough. But the whole thing gets me. There's no classification for them. In what way do you mean? I'll flash them on for you. This one, doctor, is the normal size enlarged. And this one was taken from the lock and the metal has. Here's the thing that gets me though. Take another look at them. What do you make of it? There's something unholy about those prints. They're not like anything on record. You know very well there are no two fingerprints in the world that match but those do. Except in size, they're identical in every particular. How would you designate them then? Well, if you ask me, they seem to be a combination of the human and anthropoid. Yes, yes, I see. But I'd like to know more about it, doctor. It's got me intrigued. How'd you get them and what are you after? Well, I'm not prepared to say just yet. You seg, it's all part of an experiment. But thank you ever so much. Not at all, and come in again. Like I said, I'm mighty interested. Thank you. Sit down, Mr. Whitney. How long have you known this young lady? Not very long, why? The bruises on her shoulder and arms, how did she get them? I don't know exactly. I wanted to talk to you about that. When I questioned her about them, she seemed to be incoherent. What do you think's wrong with her, doctor? Generally she seems to be all right. There's certain attributes which puzzle me greatly. For normal girl, she has unusual strength. There are peculiar characteristics about her heart and respiration. But it's her mental makeup, it seems to be harder to define than anything I've ever experienced. What way do you mean? Well, for one thing, there is undoubtedly a peculiar emotional instability there. It might be a fear complex. She seemed very much afraid of me, mumbled something about being afraid of all doctors. You are convinced she should be under a doctor's care? Well, we've had very little case history to go on. Nevertheless, I'd say there is a need, a definite need. Yes, that's why I brought her to you. You see, she was being treated by a doctor. Yes? Well, why didn't you tell me this before? Well, I wasn't quite sure he was on the right track. I thought I'd sort of check. The doctor treating her would obviously know a great deal more about the case than I. If he's handling it, he'd know what is best for her and you should have confidence in him. I think the wisest thing for you to do is to get her back to him as soon as you can. Oh, here's the young lady now. We're going, Paula. The young man and I have talked it over and he'll see that you get proper care, I'm sure. So don't worry and goodbye. Goodbye, Mr. whitley. Thank you, doctor. Come, Paula. It gets me, all these goings on around here. I don't know what's come over this place. I don't know whether to call the police or what to do. I'm all for waiting for. Oh, Dr. Fletcher, I'm so glad you're back. Why? What's happened now? I guess George can explain better than I. Well, sir, it ain't pleasant news. Ti don't know how to start. Oh, come, come now, George, get to the point. What is it? It's about Willie. Oh. You found him? 2? Yeah, in the wooded section, right down near the lake, you know. Well, sir, there he was. Dead? His eyes open but just like them birds and animals, his chest and body all crushed in. This is horrible, miss gray. He was such a well-meaning lad. You didn't move the body? Oh, no, no, no, sir. I don't want to break but I'm not afraid of anything alive but when it comes to dead things, I don't like to touch them, not even a dead fish, you might say. Miss gray, have you seen Paula? Paula? I thought she was with you. With me? Yes, she's been gone all day. See that nobody goes near that wooded section until we get the police. I'll be back soon. I don't know, daddy. I told you I don't know. I called him as I passed by but he's not in his cottage. Bob's old enough to take care of himself, I'm not his keeper. Now listen to me, Joan, it's important that I know. Where is he? We had a quarrel, he went off somewhere. But where did he go? Why don't you ask Paula? Paula? Yes, I saw them drive away in his car. You saw... Daddy, what's the matter? Joan, Bob needs our help at once. What are you trying to tell me? His life is in danger. You mean because of Paula? Yes, it's, well, it's rather difficult to explain but it's important now that you know. Remember the face you saw in your window here? You mean that... Yes, yes. Joan, I'm responsible for the fiendish murders of an inhuman monstrous creature. Or creatures. Paula. Paula. Although we've been through all this, I told you I'm gonna take you back. No, I'm afraid. But you heard what Dr. Meredith said, it's the only thing to do. T don't care. But it's best for you, believe me. Dr. Fletcher knows just what to do. T hate Dr. Fletcher. Paula, you're going back. I'm doing what I think is best. No. Well, here we are. I won't go in. Don't be impossible, Paula. I told you I'd do anything I can to help you if you'll only let me. But you brought me back here. Don't you understand? T had to. Why? Well, I shouldn't have taken you away in the first place. But I'll have a talk with Dr. Fletcher and... no. Then tell me, what do you want me to do? Take me away from here. I'm afraid of Dr. Fletcher. You shouldn't be, Paula. Dr. Fletcher's a very fine physician. Look, let's get this straight. I'm in love with Joan Fletcher and I'm going to marry her. Bob? Bob? Bob, you're back. Oh, thank heavens you're safe. Safe? You don't know what danger you were in. Danger, what danger? You were with Paula, weren't you? Yes, Bob, she isn't just an ordinary girl. She's a horrible creature. Oh, now look, dear, she's not that bad. Maybe a little mentally unbalanced but... Oh, it isn't that. I don't know how to explain it to you but, well, she's... Joan, Paula's in there with your father. No, wait a minute. I think it'd be safer if you went back to your cottage. We'll handle this alone. Oh, but Bob, I... Please, dear, do what I tell you. Oh, all right. Dr. Fletcher, Joan just told me about Paula. I made a terrible mistake and I want to apologize. There's no time for apologies. Where is Paula? Well, she came into the sanitarium. Come with me. But she isn't here. Where's Joan? I sent her down to her cottage, I thought she'd be safer there. You search the building. My intention was only to render Paula harmless until the authorities arrived. But in the struggle, I gave her an overdose of the sedative. The rest you know. Mr. coroner, not being a scientist, I'm in no position to judge the probability of Dr. Fletcher's story. But one thing is certain, a woman was killed and Dr. Fletcher admits having committed the crime. Need we go any further? Mr. district attorney, it is your opinion that Dr. Fletcher killed a woman. However, it's my duty to point out to the jury before they bring in a verdict that if what we have heard is true, it was not a woman that was killed. And if that is so, this office has no jurisdiction over the case. Well, even though I consider it a waste of time, I think I can solve your problem. I suggest we re-examine the body. Well, I should like very much to do so. Under this in view, I'll adjourn the inquest for this purpose. Wanna see her? Holy! My apologies, Dr. Fletcher. Thank you. Thank you, sir.
