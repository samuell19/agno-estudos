All right, so Baker is stumbling through the house, pushing us out of his way, trying to get down to the basement. - God! - So the cops see him, and they're like, "Excuse me, sir, can you put down the keg?" And I-- At this point, I'm like, "I want nothing to do with this situation." - Uh-huh. - So I back out of the situation. I'm just-- I'm watching it from a mile away. And it's all great. Asshole. So... So one of the cops comes up to Baker, and he goes to grab him, Baker flips a switch. He's like, "Don't touch me, you pig fucking piece of shit! "L'm not gonna take this shit from you. "You can arrest me right now. "L'm not losing this fucking keg. I'm not losing my fucking deposit!" - Oh, my God. - They tackle him to the ground. He breaks his nose, and then he gets arrested. Well, yeah, but did he get his deposit? - No. He didn't get his deposit. - Joey! You keyed my fucking car, faggot. Get off of him! What the fuck? Hey! Break it up! Get off him! Get up! Fucking pussy! Fuck you, man! You're lucky you didn't break his nose. Yeah? Because, you know, I thought he was the lucky one. So, Joey, did you key his car? Yeah, nobody saw me do it. Trevor has had a grudge on me ever since... this has to be between me and you, ...ever since I stuck my tongue down his girlfriend's throat. Keep it up, J09)!- You know he punched me. So this whole thing is bullshit. Mr. Hunt's just itching to kick you out. Joey, you are so fucking cool. Come on, really. Is this who you want to be? How safe is your drinking water? Many people are asking that question after the state fined Westford-- - Hey. - Hey, zombies. Come on, Joey. We were watching that. Come on, Dad's not coming home tonight, so you two have the pleasure of cooking dinner with moi. Pleasure? Dad's never home. How do you think he pays for this TV or the bed you two sleep in? Hm?

Well, I'm in tree removal, not construction. How's business? - Booming? - Does it look like it's booming? Ah! I'm out. I got him good. Son of a bitch busted me on the river with an inside straight. When did you get released? Me? I've been out awhile. Good behavior, baby. Shit, if we'd known you were coming by, we could have made it strip poker. Hey. Come on. God, you're pathetic. Well, it is getting late, so unless you got a warrant... Yeah, I think if I came back with a warrant, you boys would be playing cards for cigarettes. Good one. Okay, you drive safe. Keep your hands 10 and 2 on the steering wheel. Mm-hmm. Bitch. Sexy bitch. Right? Let's go put one on Keegan. Yeah, yeah. Hey! Are you shooting my tree?

Yo, put that shit away. What the hell's wrong with you? Jeez... Where are you going? I gotta go to the bathroom. You can wait until 9:30. I'm literally about to shit my pants. You're gonna be responsible for this shit all over this floor. Stop laughing. I'm serious. I am leaking. - Joey, all right, sit down. - I have to shit my pants so bad, I'm about to flip this table. All right, please stop saying, "I have to shit my pants." Just say, "I need to use the bathroom." Okay. I really have to use the bathroom. You're unbelievable. 30h You're disgusting. I can't believe they let you get away with that. Yeah, they can't wait for me to graduate. Yeah, if you graduate. Oh, no, I got my shit on lockdown. You are the one that I worry about. Someone's excited. I'm off tonight. What do you wanna do? Dude, tell your dad to watch those kids for once. Yeah. No, that's who I'm hanging with. We're gonna do family stuff. What family stuff are you gonna do with your dad? I don't know. Gonna drink beers, watch a couple movies, something like that. Fine. If you wanna hang out with your dad, maybe I'll let Morgan Silerino take me out. Whoa. Oh, no, I don't want that. All right... Friday night, when you get off work, I'll come pick you up and I'll take you to that Mexican restaurant that you love so much. SefiormMexican name. It's Sefior Pepe's, racist. Paughs] There's soda in the fridge if you want any. Cool. Make sure these two liars are in bed by 9:00 p.m. And they are not allowed to watch the 10:00 p.m. news, no matter what they tell you. Are you still dating that girl? Make sure they're in bed by 9:00. Later, brats. Ah, the entertainment's here. Start with me, miss. - Yeah, if you had a dick. - Oh! You punk-ass bitch. Aw, look at you. Oh, what's going on, little cousin? You're part of the crew now, huh? Goddamn. How many high school bitches you hitting, huh? Got any for me? Glad I'm not part of this family. Sure, you are. Your wife didn't tell you about me and her? - Oh! - All right, listen, -the babysitter here? - Yeah. Okay, do we need her for these guys? Oh... All right, listen, my son's coming out with us tonight, so let's tighten it up, not act like a bunch of jerk-offs. - Real professionals. - That's right. Grab a seat, pull it up. Tonight, Joseph, we will be taking our talents to Main Street Antiques, where their inventory features more than a few fine items, but none worth mentioning more than an incredibly rare set of coins. - Coins? - Oh, yeah, coins. But not just any coins. These- What about an alarm? All right, Joe, don't worry. We got that covered. You're gonna keep alookouL keep a lookout for if you see a cop car, late-night 109995 a little forest critter or anything. You let us know. Got it? Okay. Channel 2. When I was up in Winslow, there were these two guys. Fucking identical twins, real ugly, mean as shit. One of the brothers was always reminding the other brother that he was three minutes older. They fight like kids still. So, the older brother, he starts banging one of the chick hacks. She's about like a one and a half, but in prison that's a fucking 7, believe me. The younger brother, he catches wind of all this shit, he decides that he wants in on the action. Why not make it a family affair, you know? So he pulls it off. He starts fucking banging her. Maybe she couldn't tell the difference. Yeah, they might be different by a couple minutes, but the inches are probably the same. Anyways, some asshole ends up telling the older one that they're both getting water at the same well. So, the older one, he's smart about it. The next day, the younger brother, he's taking a shower. It's going well. Water pressure's good. Hasn't dropped the soap. He goes to shampoo. Suddenly this guy just starts fucking screaming out. "Fuck! Ow! Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck! It burns!" The older brother had put bleach in his shampoo. Paughs] He nearly went blind in his right eye and it burnt the skin right off his dick. Paughs] She could tell the difference between them after that. Joe, head around the back. Nice. Four, one, nine, nine, eight. Ah. One, nine, nine... She probably left out "pound." Four, one, nine, nine, eight. Got it. - What the fuck is this? - You got to record. Orange key. After you. Holy shit. There they are. Someone's coming. - We 're clear. - Let's get started. Keegan, man...goddamn. - What a dick. - Fuck it. Holy shit, you scared the shit out of me. Wait, you're friends with my son, Brendan. Hey, yeah. Jeremy. Jimmy? Have one. No, thanks. What are you doing out here anyway? I was going for a walk. What about you? That's my shop. Piece of shit. My wife kicked me out again. Joe. Do you copy? How you doing out there? Joe? Do you copy, Joe? Do you copy? What did you say you were doing out here? Joe, do you copy? You think I'm stupid? FUCK you! Get the fuck off me, man! You punks think you can rob me? Hey! Come on, just fucking chill out. Chill out! Relax. Relax, man. No, don't... I know who you are. Don't I? I know who you are. - Shut up. - I know-- I know who you are. I know who all of you are! Where's Britt? What happened? - Where's Britt? - Uh... - Rich! Rich! - Stay here. Bring the car around, now. Stay here. Come on. What is that? Turn it off. Turn it off. Turn it off. Turn it off. Turn the fucking thing off! Get it out. You guys put everything back where it was, right? You guys wore gloves, right? Let's go. Joe, check the pockets. What? No. A wallet? What if someone fishes here? For frogs? - Hey. - You're late. - How much is it? - Well, it would have been $20, but I was here for an extra hour and a half. - Yeah, here. - Thanks. Just so you know, Blake hit Chrissy and she tried to scratch his face. Great. Are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. Good night. Good night. The kids will be up soon. - You knew this guy? - Yeah. I used to be friends with his son. The police will come looking for him. People disappear all the time. Dad... now, I was thinking... what if we told them what happened? You know, he attacked us. Oh. You mean like we go on down to the precinct and we say, "Look, we were knocking over this antique store "and, you know, the owner caught us doing it, so things got out of hand." This isn't high school. You don't get to weasel your way out of it with the teacher. We just go along... ...like we did before. Now I got to look after these two clowns. I need you to be my rock. Will you do that? Yeah. Good. Winter Dance tickets may be purchased from Mrs. Galenson in the main office. Hey,gang. Sorry I'm late. What are you guys doing? How close? If you guys want, you can send it to me tonight and I'll go over it. Cool? It just doesn't make any sense, just that you fucking said it. It doesn't just happen... Home early? Party got canceled. Huh, you had to drive all that way? They could have let you know beforehand, -show a little courtesy. - Yeah, it wasn't too bad. Tara, this is my little cousin, Joey. Hey. Hi. He's cute, but he's got a tiny pecker. Runs in the family. Come on. She knows. She gave us the code for the alarm. Her and the owner? Yeah. He was seeing her on the side. You said we were the only four that knew. She's a good kid. Her and Britt have known each other forever. Britt's friends don't mean shit. Why didn't you tell me about her? I told you what you needed to know. Seems like a lot of people are needing to know. Joe... JOe! Can't afford to make any more mistakes. Glad you finally decided to look out for us. Hey. Some trees are gonna fall. The important thing is they don't fall on our house. Okay? Come on in and have a beer. Come on. I gotta go check on the kids first. All right, come back, I want you here. You avoiding me? Relax, I got sick. You couldn't even text? And my phone died. Fuck you, Joey. I'm not stupid. Something happened. You think I'm lying to you? I texted you, like, 20 times. Where were you? Joey, are you listening? Babe... I'm sick of this shit. Just tell me the truth. Allyson, come on, what are you--? You're lying. Please don't-- Don't do this right now. Fucking douche. Fuck you... Where's your daddy, buddy? Huh? - Where'd he go? - Brendan, step back. Go find your daddy, little bitch! Hey, come on, come on, Brendan, Brendan. No, it's not cool. Fuck, be cool! Hey! What the fuck? Fucking pussy. Hey, man...it's not worth it. What the fuck's you guys' problems, man? Get the fuck out of here. Keep running your fucking mouth. Yeah, yeah. Come on. Fuck yOU, Quys- You all right? I didn't need your help, man. Paughs] What's so funny? Nothing. You don't think I can fight? I used to wrestle you every day after school. I know you can't. Whatever, man. Hey. Hey, Brendan, I was just joking. I feel bad for you, man. Sometimes shit looks like a mess, but there's really an order to it. Keegan couldn't make it, huh? I heard a mutt got a hold of him. Yeah, no, he'll be all right. I'll tell him you asked that. I'll give you 500 for the lot. Paughs] Don't break our balls. First off, half of them are engraved. Huh? Can't sell them online. There's three PCD tipped Pergo blades in there. Barely been used. Your dick's barely been used. It don't mean it's worth something. Okay, all right, 500 it is, Stick. See? Everything has its place. No more fucking around. Now...the coins. Where are they? I ain't got them. What? I got somebody lined up for these. Yeah, we had to cancel. - And? - And nothing. And that's what you're gonna tell anyone who asks. What do I see from this? Shit. That's what. Fine by me. You look like a gambler. Why don't you go fuck yourself, grease-monkey motherfucker. - Hey, chill. - No, fuck you, man. - Hey! - I'm fucking tired of your bul-- What are you gonna do? Stick, what are you looking for? Just talk to me. What are you looking for? Trying to figure out what all this is worth. The tools... they're yours. You can keep them. Opie thinks I want a bag of tools. Joe, go wait outside. Now. You actually trust that guy? Sticky knows what's good for him. We got a 586 vehicle parked in a permitted zone, registered to Gregory Carlson. Hey, Melissa. How's it going out there? Cold. How's the search for Greg going? Still looking for him? Or are you guys back to running speed traps as usual? We were hoping to find him in one, but this morning a Statie found his car parked out by the train station. He probably outsmarted all of us. Took off somewhere a lot warmer than here. Pump one, please. Hey, Joey. You know it's cheaper at the Shell, right? But it's good to support local businesses, I guess. Brendan, I'm kind of busy right now. What do you want? The other day, man... I was just really fired up, and I hate those guys. And thanks. Yeah, man, don't mention it. - Hey, is that Joey? - Yeah. Well, ask him over for dinner. Brendan, ask him over for dinner. Hey. My mom saw you at school the other day, and told me to ask you if you want to come over for dinner. Uh, I would love to, but I gotta, you know, feed the kids tonight, so-- All right, man, it's cool. I just-- Yeah, I just thought I'd ask. Hi. Okay, here we go. I hope everybody likes asparagus, yeah. Oh, damn it. It's okay. - Sorry about that. - It's okay, it's okay. Brendan, let me have your plate, please. Thank you. - Joey, asparagus? - Uh, yes, please. Okay, good. There you go. So... what do you do with yourself nowadays, Joey? It seems like you haven't been over since... since you boys were at Truman. Yeah. Yeah, it's been a bit. I remember when you guys were little, we couldn't pull you away from that big screen TV in our playroom. You remember that, Brendan? Paughs] Yeah, you guys had cable. Oh, is that what it was? Well, we're glad to have you. You looking at colleges? Oh, no, no, I'm not right now. Well, you should really get started. There is a lot to consider. Paughs] Yeah, I don't know if it's... if it's for me. So, I noticed that you smoke. - Mom, come on. - What? Joey? Yeah. Yeah, I... I do. My cousin Britt got me-- Uh-huh, well, I think you should quit. You know, it's very bad for your health. I will, for you, Mrs. Carlson. Glad to hear that. Excuse me. I'll be right back. Hello? Yes, hi, detective. No, it's not late. We actually just sat down to dinner. Yes. Let me know if you hear from him. Well... so, where were we? Remember we used to built those snow forts? Yeah. The neighbors never stood a chance. - The Creeleys. - Oh, the Creeleys. Whatever happened to them? Private school. Of course. - Right? - Yeah. Big surprise. You ever get the feeling that everybody's talking about you? I mean, all the time. You heard about my dad, right? Just ever since he took off, it's just... everybody. I just want to punch them in the the fucking face. Yeah, I usually do. And how do you feel about it? Good. Yeah, I bet. She really thinks he's coming back. You don't? No. I mean, he hasn't answered a single phone call. He hasn't even tried to call us back. Doesn't really seem like he wants to be found. "We, the lowdown fools. We the lowdown fools." What are you doing, Joey? Did you see that? Paughs] Shit. Fuck. Man, we thought that was so cool. It wasn't? Man, why do you always have to act like such a dick at school? What? You just got this, like, tough guy routine, you know? Just, I know you, man. You're a really good guy. Ah. No, I'm not. Yeah, you are. I'm not. - You really are. - I'm not! Shit, now I'm gonna have that stupid song stuck in my head all night. - Mothertruckin'? - Yeah, that's right. - I changed that. - Why did you change that? Because I'm the better rapper and I make the executive decisions. Yeah, that's true. You are the better rapper. Yeah, and you're kind of just like P. Diddy. I'm like Notorious B.l.G. and you're P. Diddy. Oh, fuck that, you are not Notorious B.I.G. Get up, zombies. Goddamn it, Joey. Get off me. Get up. Get out of my bed. Come on. Brush your teeth. Don't hit each other, and I'll read you a bedtime story. And then the Fire Queen kissed the Ice King on the mouth, with tongue, and melted his heart. And then they died. No, they didn't die. They didn't die. All right, sleep tight, guys. Let the bedbugs bite. No mercy. No mercy, Rich. Hey! You should have got home way earlier. We had gimpy here bring over some of his brother-in-law's moonshine. One sip left. Ah. Yours. It's yours. Big chug! He's drunk already. He ain't chucked it up yet. Huh? - Hey.. - Up. ...to the Southfield Police, may they be slow on their toes and heavy on their feet. May they forever doze on our quiet Main Street. Yeah, let's go! - Brendan! Go! - Go, go, go! Oh! Oh, shit. Yeah, man, I yak after every race. Man, that's torture. Yeah, it's a little gross, but you know, I always win. Oh, yeah? You took fourth. Good enough for me. I'd cough up a lung if I ran like that. You know, you should really stop smoking, man. It's not a good look. Yeah, I know. Really, you should stop. What are you, your mom? What are you, your mom? You know that big boy, Roland? He must have lost, like, 40 pounds over the summer. I think he got that stomach surgery. Oh, yeah. Yeah, shit. It's that stomach shit. Ah, fuck... Gastric bypass. Oh! Look at you. - Mm-hmm. - Thank you, Professor Joey. Man, that shit really makes you smarter. Yeah, it does. What? She won't leave me alone, man. Yeah, you know, she's got a lot on her mind. It's just like, when she's home, like all alone, she gets so crazy. It's weird. She just wants to clean and clean and clean and clean. You know, I don't get it. I really don't. No, I get it. You know, when my mom was still around, my dad used to go out drinking without her. It used to fuck her up. She'd get so crazy and so nervous. It was like a crime was being committed if we weren't scrubbing the baseboards. Call the police. Can I hit that? Can I please have some of that? - Thank you. - Right there, brother. You okay, there? Wow, this is the Cali bud. Yeah, you definitely know your stuff, there. Hey, Joey? How long did it take, you know, after she died, until you got used to it? Brendan, your dad is coming back, okay? So shut up. That fucking thing. Give me that. What? I th-- Britt tells me you've been hanging out with this guy's kid? What are you up to, Joe? Huh? You trying to get us caught? I was keeping an eye on the situation. Making sure he didn't find out anything. You stay away from this kid. Do you understand? Do you understand? Yes, sir. What did I tell you about shooting my goddamn tree? P Aah! $1 Fuck! Brats, move. Move, move. Chrissy. Thank you. Just watch your stupid TV show. Get up, Joe. Dad's cooking dinner. Wake up, Joe. Dad's cooking dinner. Come on, wake up. Wake up. Oh, whoa, whoa. I like your technique. I like what's going on. Let's speed it up a little bit, all right? Don't be shy with the plane. Get the plane. Put it right in here. That's it. That's what I'm talking about. The whole truck. The whole truck. Bring the whole truck. Like this. That's nice on the... How are those coming along, Joey? They're good. Let's get them steaks in here. Dinnertime. We never eat this. It's good, isn't it? I don't like it. You haven't tried it yet, honey. I'll make you a piece smaller. She said she didn't like it. Yeah, I heard her. Hm. Maybe this piece needs a place to come and park. Remember this? Chrissy, you don't have to eat it if you don't want to. There it is! What do you think of it now? - Pretty good, isn't it? - Mm-hm. It's better when it comes in for a landing. What do you think of yours, Blake? Paughs] It's bloody good. Bloody good. Well, maybe you need some more blood on it. Put some more blood on that. Yeah. That's what I'm talking about. Can we afford this? What's life if you don't treat yourself once in a while? Right? You're liking that more, I'm noticing that. Paughs] Right? Mm. All right. That's enough. Okay, that's enough. Hey! That's enough! I try to do something nice... and you act like a bunch of brats. You know, this was a-- A really great meal that you cooked. Oh, I did, huh? I'd like to applaud the lady of the house for cooking such a great meal. Hm? Putting on an apron, going out there in the cold. Come on. Thank you. - You're very welcome. - Thank you. Thank you. Family time. We should do this more often. What are you getting into this weekend? I don't know. I haven't decided yet. .L might go to a party. - Really? Everyone is so wasted and annoying all the time. Well, I'm having a little thing at my place Friday night, if you want to come through. I'm so sorry. That's okay. That's okay. That's okay. It's Rich. Leave a message. This is the business of Greg Carlson, 46, of Southfield, Connecticut, which he owned and operated for nearly 20 years. Although official cause of death has not been fully declared, - foul play is suspected. - Come on, guys. You know, I can't leave you alone for ten minutes. What did I tell you about watching this shit? Unbelievable. Unbelievable. Murders don't happen around here much. Not at all, really. They're gonna start looking everywhere, they'll start putting pieces together. We covered all of our bases. There's no way that they can trace this back to us. Shut the fuck up, Keegan. You stupid motherfucker, I swear to God, you say another fucking stupid thing like that, I'll kick the shit out of you. I'm fucking so tired of you, you fat motherfucker. We were doing fine without you here. - Step outside. - This is because you couldn't hold your shit together. Now we're in this fucking shit! See what's happening here? Huh? People are getting tense. And when they get tense, they get chatty. And when people get tense and chatty... they act like morons. You know what happens to morons? Hm? They get caught. Two babies being born tonight. He's too tall. Put her over here, and him over here. All right, there we go. Festive. I'm so sorry for your loss. Did Britt ask you to keep an eye on me? No. Inn: You were going to the funeral. Yeah. When you're dead, everyone's your best friend. Who was he to you? That's why I couldn't go in. I never know what to say. Just follow what everybody else does. I could. You know, the last time I was here, my grandmother died. And I couldn't go in, even for her. Hear what they're saying? That his face was bashed in so badly, they couldn't have an open casket. It wasn't an accident. Yeah, well, people will say anything for a better story. Yeah. Hey, Tara-- You know, not a single one of you has me fooled. I know who you are. Half the fucking town's at this guy's funeral. Small town. We got company. Officer. We really do need to stop meeting like this. Not here asking about power tools, Ritchie. Trying to figure out what you are here for, babe. Where were the two of you the night Greg Carlson was killed? Aw, honey, I don't even know what day that was. Fourteenth. I was at Dowdy's having a beer. Yeah, I already checked with the bar. They didn't see you. We had a bonfire. I was having problems with my girl. They wanted to get me drunk. How old are you? What, are you trying to arrest them for giving alcohol to a minor? - Joe-- - No. My best friend's dad is dead. I'm still in my funeral clothes and you're here stirring up shit. Brendan's dad... he's never coming back. They will never share a beer together. I'm sorry for your loss. Thanks. Now get off our property. You heard him. Hey, you really go to that guy's funeral? Brendan? Honey, are you in here? Yeah. Your cousins are downstairs and they want to say goodbye. Down in a minute. Brendan.

You have to come with me. Let's go. Hey, Brendan, where are we going? You know, one night my Dad came home, said he had to tell me something. He must of had about ten fucking martinis. He said, "Brendan... "do whatever makes you happy and fuck the rest." Brendan. Brendan. Whose house is this? Brendan, it's 1:00 in the morning. Brendan, where the fuck are we? Come on. Jesus, who is that? What happened to him? You've got the wrong house. Bullshit, you know who I am. Hey, man, come on. - Let's get out of here. - You got the wrong house. Cut the shit, okay? You were fucking him, weren't you? What are you doing, man? Come on, let's go. You know you weren't his only whore, right? Yeah, that's why you fucking killed him. I didn't... I didn't kill him.

Hey. what's up? Hey. What are you doing on this side of town? I was driving by. You saw my car over here, didn't you? You were wondering, "I wonder what he's doing here." Right? Figures. They brought me in to ask me a few questions. This and that. The guys are clueless. Dogs without noses. I was-- I was in and out of the place in, like, ten minutes. I didn't tell your dad and your cousin about this. Wouldn't want to get them worried about nothing, right? Paughs] Boo! Paughs] Got you, you PUSSY- What are you doing here? Your cousin send you? Fucking idiot, didn't show up for work. No phone call, no nothing. What do you want? Uh... Spit it out. What? I-I-I saw Keegan at the police station. - What? - I saw Keegan at the police station. What were you doing at the police station? - I was-- - Hey! Hey! I don't know what he's telling you, but it ain't true. - Fuck did you do? - I went to the police station. - What? - Just listen. I figured they were gonna bring me in eventually, so why not just beat them to it? You don't voluntarily walk into a fucking police station. What'd you tell them? Paughs] Sent those fuckers on a wild goose chase. How's that? I gave them some names of some guys he owed money to. Guy was a lowlife. Huh. So what happens when they find out you were playing them? They won't. I gave them some secondhand bullshit. Who'd be dumb enough to go down to the police station if they were guilty? I promise you, we're good. You did this without talking to me. What were you doing at the police station? - We're good! - We ain't good. I went to go pick up Allyson at her place and drove past the police station and saw Keegan's car there. Nice of you to show up three hours late, and no phone call, no nothing. We got a shit storm going on over here. Hey! Hey! Hey! Come on, come on. No. no, no, no, no. Hell, Come on! - You psycho. - He's an asshole! - He tell you what he did? - You fucking psycho! Did you tell him what you did? What, you gonna murder me, too? He showed up at Tara's house with the dead guy's kid! - What? - Started interrogating her. I didn'tâ I didn't know-- I didn't know we were going there. And he didn't know nothing, okay? He didn't find out anything. Tara's freaking out. Threatening to go to the cops. I don't know what to do. Shut up! Both of you, shut up. You weren't strong enough for this. It's my fault, see, because I was too stupid to realize it. You put all of us, all of us, the kids, at risk. Me? No, no, not me. You can't even take care of your own family. Mom knew. Yeah, Mom knew. She told me we could never rely on a piece of shit like you. Okay. - Rich. - Yeah? Rich. Rich. He ain't gonna be able to keep his mouth shut. You ever hit my kid again, I'll snap your fucking neck. She serious? Tara can be so dramatic. It's hard to tell. Maybe you should go talk with her. She doesn't listen to me. Even if she doesn't go to the cops, they're gonna bring her in eventually. No way she can make it through an interrogation. You're one to talk, you fucking snitch. If I talked, the cops would be kicking in your fucking door. Britt, if Keegan said anything, we'll deal with it. But for now he got a point. If she's teetering, it's only gonna get worse. That's why you should go talk with her. Did that already. If you got another way, I'd like to hear it. What are we talking about? Hey. What are we talking about here? What the fuck you think we're talking about? Hey. Let me know if you need anything else. Hey, Allyson. Hey! Hey, I really need to talk to you. Yeah, now you want to fucking talk to me? Yeah. All right. Allyson. Allyson. - Allyson! "ca" ' help you? What? Something really bad happened. Yeah. And I'm scared. And I don't know what to do. Story of your life. Whatever it is... whatever you did... some things can't be fixed. What the shit, Joey? Shut the door. Watch your mouth, you zombie. 911, what's your emergency? 911, what's your emergency? Hello? Is someone there? Yeah, I'm here. Joey? What are--? What are you doing here? - Are you--? -ls Brendan home? Yeah, but are you okay? What's going on? Hey, Mom. It's okay, he can come up. Hey- Brendan... Look, man... I'm really sorry, okay? Leaving you back there was a dick move. I didn't mean anything I said about you or your family either. We were best friends, man. I was there. What? When your dad was killed. I was there. I was supposed to be lookout, but I missed a car in the back. It was for fucking coins. No harm. The insurance, you know. But then your dad got out of the car, and he was drunk. He came after me, and then Britt came out. Was he scared? Was my dad scared? Yeah. Yeah, he was scared. Units en route to 47 Fairfield Road, possible 1-1-2-0 in progress. Please use caution. Suspects may be armed. Tara. Tara, you home? Tara. Tara? Tara? Tara? You sleeping? Rich! Britt! Damn it. Stay down! Stay down! Oh, no. Please, please, please, Britt, come on. Come on, you fucking know me, Britt. Please. Please. You fucking pussy, do it! Do it. Do it, and let's get out of here. Do it! Rich? If you guys need anything at all, please let me know, okay? Thank you. Do you know how brave you are to do what you did? Hey, uh, do you know where Blake and Chrissy are right now? They're in a safe place with our social worker. Don't worry. You're under arrest. Do you have any other family? Yeah, I-- I think I have a great-aunt on my mom's side. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say...
