Subtitles by explosiveskull I've had the same dream three nights in a row. What is it? It's night. I'm swimming on my back at the bottom of this cave. The water's warm, and I'm staring up at all these stars. And then they just blink out. And, suddenly, the water gets very cold, and I realize there's this ceiling, like, right on top of me. And there's a door in the middle, and I reach for it, but the water is like cement now, and it keeps pulling me down, and I just can't get to it. And I start panicking, and I can't breathe. I start gasping for air. Then I wake up. What do you think that's all about? I don't know. Come here. I know this is hard for you. I know it is. This is hard for me, too. That's it. We're going away. We're going to Europe. I'm taking you to Italy. What about... Barcelona? Barcelona? No. They have the... - Oh, the lisp. Is that it? - The lisp. You've got a thing with this lisp. I don't. No, they have a thing. They lisp when they say "Barcelona." The lisp is muy - Okay. - No, we're going to Italy, a week apiece in Rome and Venice and a third week on the Amalfi Coast. That's three weeks, huh? That's three weeks. Mm. I think I'm gonna need a really big suitcase. Okay. We'll get you a really big suitcase. What do you think? I think I've heard this before. Hey. We're going, okay? Come here. I got to get going. I got to shower. Hi, Mei Ling. This is Alice from 508. You said that someone was gonna be by the other day to fix my bathtub, and they never showed, so if you could please send someone A.S.A.P., that would really be amazing. Oh, and I would prefer that they don't enter unless I'm here. Thank you. I kept calling, but he never answered 'cause nobody likes to talk on the phone anymore. I did see a guy last week, though, but he had something stuck in his teeth when he picked me up from the bus stop. And, oh, my God, his place was so barren. Like my dad's growing up in Waco. You know... where the cult was. Anyway, my sponsor says that I'm isolating and that I need to date, and I want to, but I am just so afraid of being monkey-fucked again, you know? - It's just... - Okay. - Thank you. - I'm not even horny. It's just, I can't stop touching myself. It's become some sort of an OCD thing. Thank you, Laurel. We need to move on to the next share. Who wants to go next? Go ahead. Hi. I'm Alice, love addict. Hi, Alice. So, I'm still seeing the married man. I'm just really in love with him. And I know he loves me. But I also know he'll probably never leave his wife. And my sponsor's always telling me that I deserve more, that I deserve to be put first and not just this thing on the side just feeding off crumbs, and... and she's right. I need to grow up. And saying this stuff out loud in front of you guys really helps give me the strength to leave, so thank you for listening. Thank you. Okay. Who would like to go next? "I can't stop touching myself. It's an OCD thing." Who talks like that? Ugh, she's gonna scare away all the newcomers and make them think we're a bunch of pervs. She's probably fucking homeless. - Oh, let me have a drag. - Do you want one? No, no, no. I quit. Just a drag. Mm. Okay, so, no contact. Alice, you have to do it this time. I know. You know, when Michael and I used to make love, I used to feel so amazing. Now it just feels like I'm some stripper whore. "Stripper, whore," or like a whore that strips? - I don't know. Both. - Ugh. Speaking of strippers, if I don't lose this baby fat, my husband's gonna leave me for one. Oh, come on. You look great. I'll have to get a job, go back to Wells Fargo. No, thank you. You know, you can always come to Pilates with me. Fuck that. I'll just get lipo. Okay. That's an option. Alice, you are such a beautiful person. You deserve to be happy. Come on. No guy gets to ruin your life. Unless he's a billionaire. Then screw it. Have a heyday at Chanel. Be fun. - You got this. - Okay. And you know I'm here for you. I know. - Okay, no contact. - No contact. Starting when? Starting now. Good girl. Hello? Um... can I help you? Your hair. It clogged the drain in the tub. Right. Right, you're here for the... I'm sorry. I... Uh, so... so it's fixed, then? Mm-hmm. Um, well, thank you for doing that. Um, what is your name? - Shelly. - Hi, Shelly. My name is Alice. You know, I think... Yeah, I think I've seen you in the building. You were vacuuming the hallway the other day. There's something else. Oh, my God. Mousehole back there. I closed it. I have rats? In this apartment? I've... I've never s... I've never seen any anywhere. I mean, I... Wow. Okay. - Thank you so much. - Mm-hmm. All right. You know, actually, if we could just throw that outside in the garbage chute. - Mm. - Thank you. Appreciate it. You know, Shelly? Do you do any housecleaning, by any chance? - Owner won't allow it. - Right. Mei Ling. I know. She's an interesting one. Um, well, if you're open to it, I can pay you cash. I work out of this apartment, and I've got clients that come in and out every day, and this place just gets really dirty. I was thinking $100 each time? I won't say anything to management. Hm. - Cash? - Yeah. Okay. Okay. Great. How about Tuesdays and Fridays around 5:00? If that works for you? Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Bye. But I am telling you, Tokyo is the most magically surreal place if ever there was! Herb and I went to an owl caf√©. We ate raw fish. We drank gallons of "saa-ke." And then we walked along these cherry-tree-lined streets. That sounds very romantic. You'd think, but those trees made me crave pie, like, all day. Alice, this mask smells like chocolate cake batter. I swear, I'm going to a bakery right after this. Do you want a piece of chocolate? - Yes, please. - Okay. Here you go. Mmm! Now just keep your eyes closed. Thank you. Ooh! There's a nut in the center. Oh. Did I just get that in your eye? - Uh, yeah, you did. - Oh, okay. All right. Let's get you to a sink. We'll wash it right out. - Oh. - It's okay. I got you. It doesn't burn, does it? Oh, no. I'm fine. After cataract surgery, these things are numb. They say it's easy. It's not. - Jesus Christ! - Oh! Oh. Hi, Shelly. It's Tuesday. Um, this is Shelly. She's doing some housecleaning for me. Oh. Okay. Um, well, I'm gonna be off. Okay. I'll see you next week for your needling. And, remember, no salicylic acid or glycolic three days before you come in. And we'll also get you that cleanser. I'm so sorry. I didn't hear you come in. We had the water running, so it probably just... Well, it looks like you're all prepared. Why don't you come in here? And if you don't mind starting in the kitchen, maybe mop around here a bit on the floor. It got a little dirty. I'm gonna take a bath. Oh, and, Shelly, if you get thirsty, I've got bottles of water in the fridge. Thank you. Hey. Hey. Hi. You're busy today. Yeah. I am. Uh-oh. 'Cause I need to see you. I need to see my girl. Well, you can't. Why not? Because. You know already. Ohh. Is this the no-contact thing again? Mm, it was. Well, that's okay, 'cause in first class, I can just have them switch out the seats, and we can have someone sit between us... 'cause we are going to Italy. Michael, come on. How are you gonna hide that from her? It's a work trip as far as she's concerned. It doesn't even matter 'cause I already booked the tickets. We're going, Alice. - You got them? - I did. I booked them... Venice, Rome, and the Amalfi Coast. I'm taking you... front-row seats, the opera at the Colosseum at sunset. Seriously, I'm going crazy not hearing from you. Yeah. Mm. I'm leaving the office in about an hour, okay? I'm coming over. Okay? Just say it. Just say it. Say "okay." Come on. It's two letters. - You can do it. - Okay, okay. Okay. Bye. Bye. - Hey, what's up? - Hey. - Um, can you talk for a second? - Hold on, hold on, hold on. Geisha! No! No! Eat the apple like your sister right now! What's going on? Are you okay? I'm slipping. You talked to him. Yeah. He's coming over. All right. You got weak. That's normal. Text him right now to not come over and turn off your phone. Yeah, but I know him. He's still gonna come here. Get out of the house, Alice. Go see that comedy with what's-her-face. It's just, if I'm alone, I know I'm gonna see him. Um, maybe you want to go get a coffee or something? Oh, honey, you know I would. I can't. I got the kids here. Joe's flight gets in soon. Can you call Kim or Jess? Oh, Kim's with that new guy, and Jess is with Cody. Jade, stop that! Jesus! - Honey, listen. - Mm. - Mm-hmm? - Contrary action. - Right. - Contrary action. Do something you normally - wouldn't do. - Wouldn't do, right. Yes. For God's sakes. Alice, I got to go. I got to go, honey. Just stay strong and remember to breathe. You're gonna get through this, okay? - Okay. Thank you. - Okay. Okay. - All right, love you. - Love you. Bye. Bye. The place looks beautiful. Shelly? - Um, it really looks lovely. - Hm. So, um, I know that this is super-last-minute, so I don't want you to feel any obligation at all, but I was wondering if you would like to stay for dinner. I was gonna make halibut. You hated that, huh? Mm. And now the best part of any meal... Turkish coffee. It's probably gonna keep you up late, but it's so worth it. There you go. So, do you live around here? No. Whereabouts? Just to the east. Oh, so, like, Wilmont or more in the Meadow Lake area? Yeah. Oh. You drive all the way out here every day? I don't like to spend the gas money, so I take the bus. Yeah. That makes sense. I got burned. Everyone stares. I'm sorry. I-I didn't mean... We don't have to talk about it. It was an accident... a long time ago. It's just my face. And a little here. Everything else is normal. Thank you for sharing. I know how hard it is to open up about things. Ali? Come on. Hi. You've reached Facials by Alice. Alice? Avoiding this guy. It's complicated. He's why I smoke. I'm sorry. Is this bothering you? - It's very bad. - I know, I know. I'm quitting. This is my last pack. I've, um... I've been seeing this man for quite a while, but I'm ending it. Why? Well, um, he's, um... ...married, so... You're married? No. No. Um, he has a wife... ...but he also sees me. That's not right. No, it's not. I didn't know he was married the first few months, but then... I fell hard for him, and it's an impossible situation that I wouldn't wish on an enemy. So... Yeah. But I am ending it. That's good. Mm. Yeah. Do you want to watch something on TV? Hey. You're leaving? Mm. Are the buses still running? I can just stay downstairs. Oh, you have a room here? No. So, where will you stay? Just on the bottom floor. In the garage? Yeah. Shelly, that's absurd. Let me get my keys. I'll take you home. You know, thanks for staying for dinner tonight, Shelly. It really helped me get my mind off of things. And it's always nice to make a new friend. You look like Barbie. Thank you. It's just a bunch of makeup, really. It's kind of my thing. Do you ever wear any makeup? I don't know how. Tell you what. How about on Friday when you're done cleaning, why don't I show you how to put some on? Would you like that? Stop here. - I'm sorry? - Stop the car. Is everything okay? I can walk from here now. Are you sure? Um, okay. Um... Get home safe, okay? Eat. Eat. Or I'll feed it to you. Push into that leg. Forward. Good. Yes. Inhale. Back. Exhale. Chest reaches high, high. Keep it going. Keep breathing, opening that chest, opening that chest. Facials by Alice. I'm calling from home. I needed to hear your voice. - Michael... - It's been over a week, Ali. I-I cannot handle you ignoring me. I... What kind of program tells you to just cut people off? It's because I stay in the disease if we have contact. The disease?! That's pretty... I love you. I love you. I don't love my wife. We sleep in separate rooms. I don't even fucking speak to her. I stay for Tyler. Yeah, you're just repeating yourself. Because you don't hear me. Three years, okay? Then he's in college, and that's it. I'm not a homewrecker, Michael. I'm just... I'm not gonna tear apart a family. We were already torn apart. You have nothing to do with that. Well, I don't want to see you. I don't want to talk. I just need time alone. This isn't just about you. I have a lot to lose here. It's taken me 15 fucking years to get to where I am, and I'm gonna lose half. So it's all about money? This isn't just about money. This is about my son. This is about Tyler. He's gonna lose a father. Do you have any idea what that could do to him? 'Cause I do. My father was a philandering prick. He left us. You have no idea how much pain that put me through. No, no. Alice, are you really that shallow? Will you please just stop? I just need to focus on myself. Alice, I love you, but you're being fucking selfish. Uh-huh. Well, guess what. It's about time I'm fucking selfish. - I got to go. Bye. - Alice? Fucking... Alice? Alice! Why are these here? Oh. I know. I know. I broke my promise. Um, just throw them out. Yeah. Go ahead. I'm done with those. - You need to. - Hmm? - You need to throw them out. - I do? For yourself. Okay. I've got to be strong and do it myself. Agreed. You know, I've wanted to do this for two weeks, so thank you. Okay. There we go. That's good. Now you can be perfect. Pretty far from. The place looks great. As usual. Oh, the makeup. Did you want me to show you how to put some on? - Okay. - Okay. Come on. Well, this helps a lot because most women actually have skin problems. So if you just mix the yellow and green with the color of your foundation, and it just tones down the red. You should have seen me with this stuff in high school. Do you remember Bozo the Clown? Yeah. Well, that's pretty much what I looked like before my mother finally showed me how to use it properly. Do you have any makeup of your own? No. Well, I'll tell you what. I have tons of it, so before you leave, why don't I give you this brush and this palette and some lip moisturizer? I'll make you up a whole nice bag. I like your earrings. Oh, thank you. They were my grandmother's. She was my favorite. There. Have a look. Looks nice. And, you know, with a nice dress... Do you have a dress? Do you ever wear anything like that? - Mnh-mnh. - You know, I got this new one. Let me just check really quick. I think I still have it. Let me just get this tucked in right here. Okay. There you go. You look lovely. I look like you. You look very nice. Let me give you my impression. Doesn't it feel wonderful? What in the world? That's the latest fashion. I-I just can't... I don't blame you. Let me give you my impression. Damn it. Shit! Shit! Okay. That's enough. But I'm still hungry. I know, sweetie, but you can't have too much salt. It gives you that puffy look. Now come on. Go get your dress on. Can I finish the show? There's no time, Shell. Let's go. Chop-chop. Oh, put on the pretty one with the ruffles. Oh, wait. No, no, no. The one with the flowers. What a pretty little thing you are. You know, when you grow up, you're gonna be very, very beautiful. You're gonna meet a nice man, a good man. Someone who's loyal and respects his vows. Not like your daddy. I don't like doing this, Mom. I know. But sometimes, we all have to do things we don't want to do, hmm? I don't want to do it. Sweetheart. Come here. Oh, it's okay. Oh, my little angel. Mommy loves you so much. Okay. Almost done. Mom, please. Look at me. Look at me! You watch that back talk, or I will cut that tongue out. I'm sorry, sweetheart. I scared you. I'm sorry. I love you. Okay? Okay? Okay. Oh, I see the car. All right. Scoot, scoot. Get to your room. Oh, God. Don. Don the dentist. How are my teeth? Very nice, very nice. Oh, are those new loafers? $500 gets me an hour, right? Yes, sir. Oh, would you like to try one of my freshly baked vanilla cupcakes - with a little bubblegum twist? - No, I don't want that. Oh, probably terrible for the pearly whites is what you're thinking. All right. Let's get started. All right. Here we are. Shell, you remember Don. Okay, well, I've got to go tidy up that kitchen. I'll knock on the door at 7:30. I love you. Hey, Renda, it's Alice. I'm really sorry to call last minute and cancel, but I'm just... I'm really feeling under the weather, so if you just want to call me back, then we can schedule a new time. All right. Thank you. Bye. Mm. - Shelly. Hi. - Mm. Do you want to watch something on TV? Oh, um... You know, honestly, I have a throbbing headache. I'm really not feeling very good. I can make you tea. That's very sweet of you, but I have a client coming over later this afternoon, so I... you know, I-I should... I should sleep. Tea will make you feel better for this afternoon. Um, I really would hate to trouble you. I know you have stuff that you're doing, and... Mm. I don't mind. Mm, that's really sweet. Um, but I think I'm just... not feeling up for company, you know? Tea will make you feel better. Mmm. It's good. Thank you, Shelly. You should eat. Oh, I... Um, I don't want to eat. Thank you. Why does he keep calling you? I don't know. You should tell him to stop. Mm, yeah, I have told him to stop, but I guess he just doesn't want to stop. Why? I don't know. Um, you know, Shelly, I think I'm just gonna take a nap right now. I've got the client coming over later, so... And this tea is helping. It's very good, so thank you. So, I'm just gonna go to sleep right now, okay? Okay? And exhale. Yes. Open that chest and inhale. Reach. Across those hips. Good. Guess I'm officially your stalker now. - Hi. - You're alive. Yeah, I'm sorry I wasn't at the meeting earlier today. The moment you have kids, you start worrying about everyone. I know, I know. I should have texted. I've just... I've had a million things I've been doing, and I've had, like, three facials, and I had a bunch... You're seeing him again, aren't you? Alice. Yeah. Yeah, I slipped. I just slipped. You know? All right, all right. You got to get to a meeting. I know. I just... I don't want to go. They don't work. I don't understand how I'm not supposed to see or talk to the man that I love. I don't get it. I can't do it. Alice, why do you think you keep having that dream? That's your subconscious trying to tell you something... that you need to get out of this. Yeah, well, I love him, okay? It's not that... Well, that's your disease talking. Well, you know, life's not perfect, okay? And I know the situation isn't perfect, but I'm... I don't know. You know, you can lead a horse to water... What is that supposed to mean? I'm done trying to get you to see that you deserve more than this loser. Stay with the married man. End up 45 and alone. It's your life. Yeah. Okay, great. Thanks for your understanding. No problem! Any time! Yes? I'm sorry. I can be a real judgmental bitch sometimes. It has nothing to do with you. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - I know. It's okay. It's all right. I-I just... You know, I know you don't want me to get hurt, so... No, I don't, and I've been your sponsor for years. You're more like a sister to me. You should hear the crap I say to her. Yeah, in fact, I've heard. I know what you're going through. It's totally insane. I've been there. Call me for anything. I'm still your sponsor, okay? I love you. I know. Okay. - I love you, too. - All right. Don't forget to breathe. Okay. Bye. Aah! So, uh, Dad? - Mm? - I was thinking. You want to go check out some trucks this weekend? Truck? I thought you were taking the hatchback. Yeah, if Dad ever gets the brakes fixed. Oh, come on. They're not that bad. Dad, they're brutal. I'm not driving that. Hmm? It's a car. It sounds like a mule. You press the brakes even a little, and it's like nails to a chalkboard. - And how would you know? - Uh... just when Dad drives. Are you taking him driving? Absolutely not. You guys. So, I was thinking of turning the study into a yoga studio. I'd love that. Maybe we could go to the paint store tonight, - look at swatches? - Mm, sounds like fun, but, uh, I have to go back to the office. The Levy case? Yeah. I thought that was over. Yeah, we all did. They reopened it, and, uh, I have to do all the paperwork. Alice? $20, $40, $60, $80, $100. $20, $40, $60, $80, $200. $20, $40, $60, $80, $300. $20, $40, $60, $80, $400. For an extra $100, I'll throw you another half-hour. We'll see. All right. I'll check on you two later. Aah! Aah! Jesus! Man! - What the hell's going on here?! - Aah! Aah! This goddamn little whore just about bit my fucking finger off! Oh! I ain't paying for this shit. Damn. Mm. You need to end this. Right here. Okay? No! No! No! No! No! You have to. For yourself. This is hydrofluoric acid. It can cause just as much damage as this. Maybe more. He'll suffer for hours. You shouldn't let that happen. Do it. Do it. You're perfect now. But, I mean, you're not completely positive, right? Yeah, I'm pretty goddamn positive. Well, can you look through a window - or something? - They could be on the top floor. What? I'm gonna climb the fucking wall? Helen, just calm down, okay? I'm on your side. Hel, come on. It's not uncommon after 20 years of marriage. If I find out who this girl is, I swear to fucking God. I know. Helen, you need to stop this. This is about you and Michael. It's not about her. Oh. - I gave up my career for us. - I know. And this is what fucking what I get. - I know. - Shit! What happened? Are you okay? He just left. I got to go. I'll call you back. Hel... - Where are you now? - I don't know. Way out east in the middle of nowhere. Where the hell is he going? I have no idea. - Shit. - What? What's wrong? My tank is so low. I'm gonna run out of gas. Helen, you need to stop this. - Hello? - Pull over and... Can you hear me? You're breaking up. I'll call you back when I get a signal, okay? Shit. No, no, no. God, you got to be kidding me. Mm. Mm. Mm. I have to go. But when I get back, you'll be very comfortable. Mm. Mm. Mm, mm. Mm. Mm. Come on. Let's get this on. Are you gonna make this difficult every time? I want to go outside. Absolutely not. The doctor said you have to stay out of the sun. It is your best chance for healing. It doesn't matter. I'll never look normal. Hey, any progress is good. We need to start getting you clients again, and nobody's gonna come see you looking like that. We'll start bringing in some money again, and Mommy won't have to go back to work at that cockamamy fertilizer plant. I'm not doing that anymore. Excuse me? Let me out of this room. You're gonna stay in this room, and you're gonna heal. I don't care if it takes another six months. Do you understand me?! I... hate... you. What did I tell you about that mouth?! What did I tell you?! Aah! Is this what you want? Is this what you want?! Is it?! Give it to me. Give me. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, my baby. Oh, my baby. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Baby, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I love you, sweetie. I'm so sorry. I love you, and I'll protect you. You're my sweet angel. I love you, my sweetheart. I love you. You're the sweetest. Oh, God. Oh! Aah! Aah! Get it out! Oh, my God. Aah! Eat. Hey! Really? Help me! You break down or something? I ran out of gas. Well! Looks like the good Lord pulled a fast one on you. Guess so. Look, I can pick you up a tank and bring it back, if you'd like. Really? Thank you. That would be wonderful. Hold tight, little lady. Do you know if there are many houses around here? I saw a car make a turn down the road up ahead. A few scattered here and there. Not much, though. Where you heading? Oh, I'm just heading out east to visit my sister. How much do I owe you? Oh, no, no, no, no. Think of it as, uh, as my good deed. Thank you. That's very kind. Well, it's funny. I was washing my dog this morning, and Jesus told me that I was gonna save somebody in need. Didn't tell me it was gonna be a pretty blonde. Now then, you pay this forward. That's the way to Christ. Be safe, now, you hear? Michael? Oh, my God! There's a crazy woman that's trying to kill me. - Where's my husband? - I don't know. My husband's car is parked out front. Where's my husband? Where's Michael, my husband? Look, there's a crazy woman that's trying to kill me. You have to get me out of here, or she's gonna kill us both. Can you please help me? Please. Please. I think you need a knife. - Please. - I can't find it. You need to get a knife and cut it. Please hurry! Oh, please hurry. Please hurry. Come on. You got to keep cutting. Come on. Got to keep... You're her, aren't you? I'll tell you everything, but, right now, we just have to get out of here, okay? Please. Please. Thank you. When we get to the car, you need to tell me...
