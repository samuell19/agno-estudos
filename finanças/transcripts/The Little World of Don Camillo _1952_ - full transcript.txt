[Here is the town. A small world in a small world...] [... placed somewhere in the north of Italy.] [There it lies in that slice of rich, flat earth...] [... between the Po River and the Appenines.] [There is dense, freezing fog in the winter.] [Ln summer, a burning sun hammers down on the people's brains...] [... and irritates them. Political passions explode violently...] [... and the fight is hard, but men are always men...] [... and what happens here doesn't happen anywhere else.] [We are at the start of the summer of 1946.] [A few days ago, there was the election of a new Town Council...] [... and the Communists have gained the majority.] Jesus, do you see how far they've gone? One day they'll even get in here and trample our feet. Sunday, when I said what I thought of them from the pulpit... ...someone suddenly jumped from a bush and beat me with a stick. And you got him back. You're right, blessed are the peaceful. I was carrying a dozen eggs and I was trying to save them. It was dark and I couldn't see who it was but if I knew... You must pardon those who offend, that is the law. Just between us, a trampling is good for you. You'll learn not to do politics in my house. In your place, I'd have never allowed Peppone to be Mayor. None of the new councilmen know anything at all. The illiterate are directing town affairs. But you know they had no time for school. - Life is hard for those who work the fields. - Whose fault is that? It's the heart that counts, not the grammar. - Before you criticize, let them get to work. - Nobody can discuss... Listen to them now! I taught them music! Viva Peppone! Say it with me, "viva Peppone". Viva Peppone! Peppone! Say it with me, "viva Peppone". Viva Peppone! [This is Counselor Schiletti, the only one elected by the opposition.] [The other is Miss Cristina, the town's old teacher.] [She's 85 years old and lives on memories.] [These two have seen something from the window...] [... that is the end of the world for them.] [Will she wait to return home? No, she's not afraid. She knows everyone.] [And she has boxed all their ears at least once.] Hello? Hello? Hello? You can hear nothing, turn up the volume! Everyone has to hear this! The final victory is near. Unite! Unite! There, that's better. You see that, Jesus? They aimed their trumpet against us. What can you do, Don Camillo? That's progress. Good day, Miss Cristina. - Who are you? - I'm Gina Filotti. Don't you remember me? Gina? Goodness! Now I have to look up to see you. I'm getting smaller. - You haven't changed. - I have. Did you behave at boarding school? - Yes, Miss Cristina. - You're here on a terrible day. Look there. Comrades! Before giving the podium to the comrade who came from the city... ...to celebrate our triumph for the people and democracy... ...I want to tell you great news. We will soon begin building a Citizen's Center... ...which will have a library with books... ...a dance hall, a cinema and other cultural activities... ...a gynmasium for physical training and running track... ...that will be your home! A Center for the people! Citizen's Center! Where will he get the money? Now I've given you the wonderful news... ...our delegate comrade will speak. Comrades, I'm here to congratulate myself... ...and Comrade Giuseppe Bottazzi, our friend Peppone... ...for the rousing victory over the enemies of the people! - Jesus, I'll make a march on Rome! - Stop. This doesn't concern you. Only in here can you do what you want. ...but strong and... - Here, I can? - Yes. This is your home. We'll crush the class that's exploiting us. You must stay within the law and we will... ...at the cost of nailing all enemies of the people to a wall! Meanwhile... - Who is that? - Don Camillo. - Make him be quiet! You try, you'd have to aim a cannon at the bell tower. If he won't stop, we should shoot him in the tower window. You'd better kill him on the first shot, he'll shoot back. Why is he stopping? Why is he letting them speak? Is he one of them? I've always said he was a Bolshevik priest. Isn't that Mariolino carrying the flag? Yes, it's him! He's redder than his father... ...standing on the platform. A nice family of criminals! Did you hear? We will no longer tolerate any attempts on our freedom of speach! Those who hide in the shadow of the Cross... ...and who seek to misguide the people... ...are the same ones who betrayed Christ many centuries ago. They're attacking the Church! They must be stopped! I can't stay. Gina, it's you! You look great! Almost like a grown woman. What should I look like, a goat? You used to. I'm busy now, may I see you tonight? Go on, ugly! Go join your band of brigands! Better my brigands than your damned priests. Comrades, we have another comrade! Peppone! He's beautiful! He looks like you! [Lf Don Camillo is ringing the bells, it's not to celebrate his victory.] [Lt is because he's happy for his old enemy, Peppone.] [Their struggle has gone on for years.] [They left for the war together and returned together...] [... always together and always enemies.] [One night an old abandoned house began to burn...] [... and the whole town watched dumbstruck as the stones burned...] [... which logic would tell you would not burn.] - Listen... - I want to know how that pile of rock is burning. - Stop, Don Camillo! Go back! - Why are you interfering? I'm not. It's silly to put yourself in danger. It's only rocks burning. It stinks of petrol. It could be... ...something else. - Like what? - I don't know anything. - Do you believe that... - I don't believe anything. You don't like your flock to see you get bravery lessons... ...from an old reactionary priest! - Stop! - Like hell! Go water your flowers. We'll see who's afraid. Stop, Don Camillo! It would have been better to let you go ahead. The world's most reactionary priest would have blown up. - I'd have stopped in time. - Why? I knew that in the cellar were 6 barrels of petrol... ...300 grenades, 95 rifles, 2 cases of ammunition, 7 machine guns... ...and 300 kilos of explosives. I inventoried your warehouse before I burned it. - I should kill you. - Kill me? That won't be easy. You've actually done me a favor. That stuff was weighing on my conscience. You said there were 7 machine guns. There were 8. Who took the other one? I did. When the proletarian revolution begins... ...stay far away from my church. - I'll see you in hell. [This lasted for years.] [Lf Don Camillo couldn't stomach the blows received from an aggressor...] [... Peppone couldn't forget the way the cursed church bells...] [... had greeted his election.] [A few days later, Matuggia, the sacristan...] - What is it? Who's there? - I don't know. I think... - What do you think? - I saw... - Who? - Last night... - Who do you mean? - I saw Peppone leaving the church. The Mayor? That's how he's improving public places, eh? I asked him to fix the tower, but he's destroying it. - Why didn't you tell me? - I thought he'd come for confession. - Confession! - Yes. - Confession! - Yes. I'll give him confession alright! - Don Camillo, put that down. - What? - Put it down, it's an ugly thing. - It's made of poplar. It's light. Throw it away and don't think about Peppone. How can I forget him if you're sending his wife to me now? - What is it? - A baptism, Father. - Who's his mother? - I am! - Your husband is the father? Who should it be, you? - Why so angry? Doesn't your party practice free love? - Oh! - What will his name be? - Libero Antonio Lenin. Let the Russians baptize him. Let's go! I really gave it to those godless people. That was stupid. Call them back and baptize the baby. Jesus, you must keep in mind that baptism is no joke. Don't explain baptism to me, I invented it! The baby won't go to heaven if he dies. Why should he die? He's pink and healthy. I get it, I'm always wrong. I'll try to call them back. I'll leave when my son is baptized with the name I want. Town Hall is outside. This is a church. Careful, I have a delicate stomach. Do you remember that bullet I took in the war? No low blows. Don't worry, I'll get you only on the top floor. - What time is it? - Who knows? Alright, you win. That's for the baptism, that's for the grenades. - What grenades? - Don't play innocent. That's what you do. Destroy and burn. And you want to build a Citizen's Center! Be quiet, you little Bolshevik. Coochy-coochy-coo! He's smarter than his father. - Where are you getting the money for that building? - I'll find it. If we have a drought... ...you won't be able to buy the first brick. I know, I've been fighting for a city park for ten years. But you don't want it to cost anything. Well, shall we baptize this treasure? What are we going to call him? Libero Antonio Camillo. - Camillo as well? - Yes. If that's the case, you can add Lenin too. Camillo cancels out those other types. Show me the baby. [Ciro dell'Abbruciata, Mariolino's grandfather, is the godfather.] [The Abbruciata farm is as hard and bald as a squash.] [Lf he planted dynamite, maybe it would grow.] [But Ciro and his son insist on planting grain.] Mariolino! [On the farm on the side belonging to Gina's family...] [... the earth is beautiful and only a caress is needed for grain to grow.] [Poverty and wealth, the sun and politics added...] [... makes them detest each other.] [And so a wall was built to avoid trouble.] Are you crazy? My father will kill me if he sees us. Why didn't you come the other day? I waited until night. - You told me to go away. - It was nothing, I was angry. You're so handsome! You're getting a beard. - You were running, your skin is boiling. - No, I didn't run. It prickles. [There they are, Romeo and Juliet.] [When they were babies their families became enemies.] [At that time the wall hadn't yet been built.] [The slightest incident always complicated matters.] [The battle extended to the mothers and fathers...] [... then to the rest of the family...] [... and finally to the grandparents.] Your Peppone is a brigand! That priest of yours makes you want to turn Muslim. - You are a Muslim! Hypocrite! - Gina! My grandfather! He'll pull my hair out! See you tonight. - Gina! - See you this evening. - Here I am! Gina! - Where were you? - I went to see if the apples are ripe. Apples won't help with your exams. Go study! That old pig let his pidgeons out again. Killer! Assassin! Do my pidgeons bother you passing over your land? They block the sun! The sun wasn't made for old fools like you! If you shoot again, I'll set your hut on fire! I shoot at whatever passes over what's mine. Here's your pidgeon, it's tough as iron. Take it! - Eat it! - You rotten old buzzard. - Eat it so it'll strangle you! - So you could cry over me! Rotten buzzard! [The pidgeon didn't go to waste.] [Gina brought it to Miss Cristina who had a feast.] [Cristina had taught at the town school for 50 years.] [When she retired, the people...] [... had given her an alarm clock. So the old teacher sets the alarm...] [... and continues hoping for a pension from the government.] - Who is it? - Scartassini. Who are the others? Friends of mine. We have something important to say. Come in. - Well, what is it? - Something important happened. There were elections and the Reds won. The Reds are rotten people. - But, we're the Reds! - They're still rotten. We know what we want politically... ...and we really don't need anything... ...but when it comes to administration you need to write, answer reports... ...and you're the only one we can turn to, paid of course. You'll pay me? We can come from the fields every night and you can drill us. Look at the reports, correct our mistakes... It's too late for you. You should have studied long ago. We were sent to the fields instead of school. - The fault wasn't all ours. - Who are you? - Ah, Brusco dell'Abbruciata. - Yes. - The same brat as always. You're right, it wasn't your fault. Be seated! Has Giuseppino gotten all his teeth yet? He's about to be married! Is your sister-in-law still nasty, Luigi? She gets worse as she gets older. Get out! Me? You did me too many wrongs! But, you can't... This rascal came to school with pockets full of frogs. One day he came to school riding a cow! But he's the Mayor! Mayor or not, if you don't leave... ...l'll cane you so hard, you'll go bald! Go away! I told you so, I played a few too many on her. You're never to step foot here again. Even if you become Minister of Education! Peppone is an ass. Peppone brought this to me to type. He wants 15 copies. Listen to this mess. First and last warning. Last night too a vicious anonymous hand wrote an offensive insult... ...on our daily message board. The hand of this slob has to calm down. He's exploiting our work to provoke us. If he don't stop, he'll be sorry when it's too late. Every patience has a limit. Section Secretary, Giuseppe Bottazzi, aka Peppone. What provocation? Do you know anything, Barchini? Don't you know anything? Everytime they put up a poster it's full of blunders... ...someone always writes "Peppone is an ass" above it. Peppone is an ass, and when one is an ass and writes proclamations... ...we all see that he's an ass, true? It's natural. The people see and comment. I have to make the copies now. He wants them in the morning. Goodnight. - Peppone is an ass. - And what are you? What am I? I don't understand, Lord. Last night, when you went to buy the cigar... ...the one you still have half of in your pocket... ...didn't you perchance stop and read the message board? I didn't actually read it. I only glanced at it. And didn't you notice some strange writing? When I stopped there was nothing written there. - I'm being called to the sacristy, I think. - Don Camillo, wait! And when you left, did you notice anything strange there? Now that you mention it, there was something written in red pencil... ...on the bottom. They're waiting for me. Shame on you, ridiculing a man because he only reached third grade. The whole town is laughing at him. Listen to what you've done. Peppone is an ass. Peppone is an ass! - Peppone is an ass! - Peppone is an ass! Peppone is an ass! I didn't want that. What should I do? Who sins must do penance. - Blessed Mother. - Don't call on those who have nothing to do with it. - But she's still your mother! - Don Camillo! You judge me badly, Jesus. Here's my half cigar. You know I can't buy another all week. - Look at what I'll do. - Very good, I accept your penance. Get rid of the crumbs, you can smoke those in a pipe. - Good evening, Father. - Good evening, Mr Mayor. Not Mayor, just a Christian. I've come to confess. God be with you. You have more need than anyone for His blessing. How long since your last confession? - It was in 1918. - 1918! You must have committed many sins with all your bad ideas. - Yes, many. - Come with me. [Peppone quickly told all...] [... but the most difficult to confess was his last sin.] Finally, it was me a month ago... ...when you were returning with the basket of eggs... ...who jumped on you with a stick. It was you! I didn't hit you as a minister of God, but as a political enemy. 10 Our Fathers and 10 Hail Marys. Ego te absolvo a peccatis tuis. In nomine Patris et Filiis et Spiritu Sancti. Amen. Amen. - Jesus, I'll pulverize him! - No. I forgave him and so must you. Jesus, if I'm a good servant of God, let me break this candle on him. What's a candle? Your hands are for blessing, not for striking. My hands are made for blessing. How about my feet? Alright. We're even. But I haven't confessed everything. But I already gave you absolution, that's sacrilege. They're not exactly sins. Maybe just small errors. Shouldn't you correct your penitent's errors? - It's our duty. - Good, here it is. - Citizens! - Shh! Citizens, while we salute... ...the glorious affirmation of our list... I won't answer for my actions! I'll answer, do your duty. Correcting Red propaganda?! You'll work on his spelling which has no political color. Come here with your literature. Here we are. Good. But there's one thing here... ...where I wrote: "We intend to enlarge the school building"... ...you wrote: "We intend to enlarge the school building..." "...and repair the church bell tower". Why? - It's a question of grammatical rules. - Ah! Lucky for your bell tower that you studied Latin. It dampens my hope of seeing it fall on your head. - We must kneel before God's will. Cheers. - Cheers. Oh, that rascal that's been writing on your posters... ...I think I know who it is. I'll tell him to stop. That would be a lot better for him. I kept the stick I used that night. - Goodnight, Father. - Goodnight, Mr Mayor. - Is the Citizen's Center moving along? - It's coming along. Lord, they don't have enough to buy the first stone. Where did you get that cigar, Camillo? Peppone had two. I think I took it without asking him. You know he believes in equal distribution of wealth. [Don Camillo can go back to dreaming of his park now...] [... because he's convinced that Peppone was bluffing...] [... and that he really has no hope of building a Citizen's Center.] Our comrade Mayor asks our priest the honor of his presence... ...at the socialistic ceremony tomorrow morning in Piazza della Libert?. - What ceremony? - I don't know anything else. No, I won't go. Tell the comrade Mayor I don't want to hear... ...the usual stupidities against reactionaries and capitalists. It's not political. It's all patriotic in a social way. If you don't come, you don't understand democracy! - I'll be there. - He said to come in uniform and bring your tools. - What tools? - Your pail and brush so you can bless stuff. But, but... Socialistic ceremony indeed! Comrades and fellow citizens... ...I am happy to place the first stone in the Citizen's Center... ...soon to rise here in the heart of town... ...symbol of our will toward action and social progress. Amen. Our dear priest will honor us with his words. Dear friends, I would like to express all the joy I feel... ...and the recognition I owe to our Mayor... ...for inviting me to this ceremony. - Thank you. [Don Camillo lost sleep.] [How did Peppone find that money?] [Finally, he thought he'd guessed.] Do these hooves have the honor of being the Mayor's? Would you mind leaving a worker in peace? I wanted to congratulate you on the Citizen's Center. I didn't have time on Sunday, at public ceremonies... ...one can never say what one really thinks. - You can easily guess what they'd say. - Not all of it. Listen brigand, make your Citizen's Center smaller... ...it costs too much and there's a more urgent matter. - Have you lost your mind? - I'm perfectly all there. Do you remember when you were a Partisan? When you attacked that escaping enemy convoy? And that truck you captured... ...the one carrying spoils of war gold and the division's pay? And that day that you sent comrades Brusco and Smilzo... ...to take the truck and consign it to the authorities? Poor guys! Remember how they returned? On foot... and in bad condition. Three tanks had attacked them! - And goodbye truck full of gold. - What are you insinuating? Nothing. Just that tonight I dreamed there were no tanks... ...and the truck was never lost. - You never change! - You always try to dishonor us! - Don't yell, you could burst a vein. - Poor Peppone, your memory is gone. Try to remember. - Oh! This is a fully legal receipt and statement. With the capture of that truck, we earned ten million lire. It was entirely spent on the people. No one touched a cent. - If someone has anything to say, I can fix them. - So can I. Priest, I don't think there's reason to fight. I don't either, we agree. 10 million gained for the people... ...that is, 7 million for the Center... ...and 3 million for a park for the people's children. Sinite parvulos venire ad me. 7 million plus 3 equals 10 million. I only ask what is due to me. [And in his turn, Don Camillo placed the first stone...] [... in his famous city park.] [But the two building sites in town couldn't give work to everyone.] [Poverty was great.] [The workers expected Peppone to relieve their problem.] [He called together the richest landowners in Town Hall...] [... but they hid behind the law.] [They said it wasn't their fault things were going badly.] And the bridge we're building over the ditch? And the 5 kilometer irrigation canal? There's work for everyone but the town has no money. This is what I've decided to do: A land tax of 1,000 lire... ...to finance the work. If you agree, it's OK. If you don't agree, you'll have to deal with the hungry people. [1,000 lire was a hefty sum.] [Lt was the same as a million for old Filotti.] [His refusal to pay...] [... provoked the others into agreement.] Then I'll have to order a farm worker's strike. We'll see who'll work your land. [Work stopped on all the land in town.] [One day, the bellowing of Filotti's cows...] [... could be heard for a kilometer. The strike picketers...] [... stopped everyone from feeding and milking the livestock.] Hey! Where are you going? To milk my cows and feed them. I have that right, no? It's not worth it. The picket guard won't let you. You're proud of what you do, pleased with yourself. It's cruel to those animals. Their udders are hard as rocks with days milk. Shame on you! Castaldi's wife has no milk either. She can't nurse since her husband lost his job. They had to put the baby in a charity home. And she's not the only hungry one. There's no other way. If the cows have to die, they will! Do you think there is any place on earth where people can be peaceful? There must be, I'm sure of it. Or life wouldn't be worth living. Hey, you! Stop! - Where are you going? - Be careful with that thing. It's forbidden to go further. I have to. Listen to my cow, she's calving. She'll die without my help. I have to go, that calf is being born today. Gisella's son says Gigiotti's grapes are rotting. I know, Brusco told my husband. Peppone's doubling the picketers with city people. - They're bringing machine guns! - This is bad! - They wouldn't let him in. Mariolino wanted to shoot him. - Oh! - Shoot whom? - Giacomo, Filotti's old cowman. The red cow who's calving is going to die! And so are the others with udders like that and nothing in their bellies! - Jesus, there has to be a limit! - What scoundrels! - May God punish them! - Send them all to hell! Quiet, you old madwomen! The selfish, stubborn owners are responsible too. May God send Filotti and his peers to hell with no pity! Pardon me, Jesus, I believe I'm angry. You won't send anyone to hell. But letting them die like this is stupid! - Ah! - Jesus! - Let's go! - Let's go away! Lord, don't let anyone jump on me on the other side. Who's there? Answer or I'll shoot. Careful, or I'll shoot back. You're involved in this too, it seemed strange. Hear that music? If those cows die, you'll have more jobless. That's the curse of farm towns. In the city... ...they only have to close the shops. Machines don't need milking. - And you can't put a dead cow back on its legs. - Stay here. Stop or I'll turn you into a sieve. Peppone's stubborn as a mule, but he won't shoot... ...a priest obeying God's word in his back. Who's there? Stop that, it's me, Peppone. Go take a walk, it'll wake you up. You want to turn this beautiful stall into a cemetery? Hurry up, go in there! I'll take care of the red cow. You get the hay to them. - We'll milk them later... - Shut up! - I won't shut up! [They worked like mules. And when it was done...] [... it was necessary to wait for night.] Jack, cavalier and king! - I'm so hungry I could eat a bishop! - They're hard to digest. To your health! - They're not bellowing. - They must be dying. They'll all die. - Hey! Go to town and buy 50 liters of disinfectant. - OK. Others will die before I do. [When God willed, the strike ended...] [... and life returned to the fields.] [The city strikers arrived when it was all over.] What about the strike? - It's over. - Over? What did we come here for? #... march ahead, folks, to revolt. Red flag, red flag... # [lt was hot, so there was only one thing for them to do:] [... have a good drink.] Look, there's a priest racing! Hey, Bartali! Hey, you speed merchant! Careful of your skirt! We agree that the city boys didn't behave well... ...but he pulverized 15 of them. - 15! Excellency, you must admit the town cannot have this. - A priest shouldn't behave like a steamroller. - I understand. I see he is a danger to the town. A change of parish priests is inevitable. Excuse me. - We'll send you Don Pietro. - Don Pietro? That young man you saw. He won't bother you. - That half pint? - Mr Mayor! Pardon, but if I punch that little priest, I'll send him flying meters. If I punch Don Camillo, he doesn't move a centimeter. Why do you have to punch him? That little priest is church material. Once you get him robed, he must look like a coatrack wearing a cape. Do you measure a priest's worth in size and weight? No, we're not savages... ...but the eye needs its share too. - What we mean is... - Shut up. What we mean is... ...we don't want Don Camillo taken away, but to make him stay in his place... ...make him stop doing politics and to mind his own business. A brain washing, so to speak. - Alright, I think you deserve that. - Thank you, Excellency. Church pews weren't enough? Now you throw tables too. - In a moment of weakness, I... - I know... ...but a man of God preaches love and kindness... ...and does not throw tables on his neighbor's heads. For shame! Don't try to tell me you were alone! You prepared an ambush, right? One man can't beat fifteen others. Excellency, I was alone, I swear it. The table dropped on them and... - It was like that one. - Like that one? - Go on, lift it! - What? - Lift it! It's time to show what you can do. If you're telling the truth, prove it! Come on! Throw it! - What do you mean? - Throw it! My poor Don Camillo, you will never be a bishop. Excellency, are you hurt? No, nothing happened. It was me. Don Camillo made me angry and I lost my temper. [Don Camillo got a pardon and a promise...] [... that the Bishop would come and inaugurate his park.] [The Citizen's Center slowly rose.] - Is the arch-priest looking for something? - I was passing by... This Center isn't going up so fast, Mr Mayor! It's a Center, not a dirigible! - I'll inaugurate it in three weeks. - Inaugurate what? - The city park. You haven't even started... ...work on that swamp. - You're spying on me! - No, I'm just observing. Then you know the ballfield is ready to inaugurate. - What is this, monthly payments? - Aren't you inaugurating this hut? Don't get angry, I am not having inauguration ceremonies. I came to propose a soccer match... ...between your "Dynamos" and my "Braves". Do you want to open your field with a defeat? Do you agree? I agree. You'd better train your little girls. Will you come to the procession, Mr Mayor? I've never missed a blessing of the river. I'll be there with the whole Party section waving a flag. - Not your flag! - Why, does red hurt your eyes? This is a religious, not a political procession. - Come without the flag or don't come. - You're not II Duce. Look at what I do to dictators. Careful, you'll demolish your Center that way. [Because he could not come with his flag...] [... Peppone decided to boycott the procession.] [The town was warned that whoever valued his skin...] [... should not go.] They're capable of throwing a bomb! The procession should be cancelled. Do as you wish, I don't care. What's going on? I think we'd better go home. - Goodbye, Father. - Goodbye, Father. Goodbye, Don Camillo. Go home... ...this is none of your business. Well, are we going, Don Camillo? The river must be beautiful in this sunshine. I'd really like to see it. Let's go, Lord. They could have made this cross a bit lighter. Tell me, I had to haul it up a hill... ...and I don't have your back. Get lost! - Get lost! - Leave him alone, this way Peppone can't say... ...that not even a dog came to the procession. Jesus, hold on tight, we're going to fight. I'm not moving aside for you, but for Him. Then take off your hat. Jesus, if the few honest homes in this filthy town... ...could float like Noah's Ark, I'd say, "Make the river..." "...overflow its banks and drown this town". "But, as the honest people live in the same homes as the criminals..." "...you can't punish everyone because of Peppone..." "...and his godless and lawless gang". So I pray you save them from flood and bring prosperity. Amen. Amen! [Lt was necessary for Jesus to guard the river's calm.] [When angered, it caused grave damages.] [A hat was found here once in a hollow.] [The river had drowned it along with the sacristan.] [The sacristan was Miss Cristina's grandfather...] [... and so, on every anniversary...] You'll leave the family when you teach. You may even leave this town. I'll work where you are and we'll marry. When I'm a teacher... Why not when I have white hair? Aren't 2 years too long? Two years, a hundred years... You can wait, right? Is that how you love me? I don't want you to cry. And all this time, we've had to see each other secretly. If we're caught, your nasty father will break your head. And your dirty grandfather will close you in a convent! If he did, I'd burn the convent! That's the best way to accomodate things. Miss Cristina! - We're so unhappy. - You're mostly stupid! Did you have to choose a convent burner? And couldn't you choose one of the crazies in your gang? We didn't choose, we found each other. You're not only stupid, you're unlucky. Help us, Miss Cristina. - Did you hear the bell? - What bell? The one in the submerged church. It brings bad luck. Does a future teacher believe such nonsense? - I didn't think you were backwards. - I'm not backwards! Tell him, Miss Cristina, tell this fool it's true. It rang when Tolli drowned in '86. It rang when the girl jumped from the bridge in '94. - The last time was in 1912... - Listen! It's thunder! Can't you see the clouds? Do you think so? This silly boy is right this time. Are those filthy pants... ...the new political way of showing legs? - I'm playing soccer! The game! Who knows what will be now? See you later, Gina. Goodbye, Miss Cristina. He's not a bad boy. I'll speak to his father and your grandfather. If they insist, I'll give them a good caning. These old idiots deserve it! We want the game! We want the game! - Where were you? - I... - Shut up! We'll talk after the game. Attention! I only want to say one thing. You're playing against the reactionary team. You have to win or I'll break your heads! Attention! My dear boys, listen well. I make no threats... ...but if there is one among you, some brigand who doesn't fight... ...to the last drop of blood I'll pulverize your behinds. I am strictly neutral politically. I have never been political in my life. You may all count on my impartiality. I beg you to remember that only sport is done here. We are not in Town Hall. If there's no corruption, we'll win. - Where were you? - At Aunt Marisa's. No! Dammit! Goal! That can't be a goal! That's the result of your propaganda! [At the end of the first half there were no dead...] [... on the field or in the stands.] [Don Camillo's team had scored two goals...] [... and hoped to win two to one.] If you don't score in the first five minutes... ...l'll rip out your gut and wrap it around your neck! Goal! I knew it would end like this! Don't be upset! [A few minutes from the end, the teams were even.] Hey! Referee! That's not a penalty! Traitor! Shouldn't I be angry? Goal! Shame on you! - Jesus, why didn't you help? - Why should I help you? Your men have 22 legs, their men have 22 legs. I take care of souls, not legs. Did you look at that lousy referee's soul? He gave them a foul that we should have gotten. They want to kill me! Save me! Go back or I'll break your heads! This is a sacred place. Shame on you! Go back to your caves and may God forgive you. Make the sign of the Cross. Hurry up! The sign of the Cross stands between you and this man. It's sacrilege to violate that sacred barrier. Leave here! Vade retro! Now to us. May God punish you if you lie. - What did Peppone pay you so he'd win? - 2,500 lire. - Mh! Get out! Criminal! Snake in the grass! Traitor! Don't I have reason to be angry? Didn't I tell you he could be bought? Who offered that man 2,000 lire for the same service? Who can hide anything from you? You bribed him and you deserved to lose. I accept that as penance... ...but seeing a team like that lose, a team of real champions... ...it breaks your heart, it cries for revenge! - Camillo! You can't understand me, sport is special. - You either understand what I mean or you don't. - I understand you... ...all too well. When is the rematch? - Rematch? It will be 5-0! They won't even see the ball! Goal! [A few days later, old Filotti called for Don Camillo...] [... to speak to him of an urgent matter.] I need your spiritual assistance. Why? What did she do? - I did nothing wrong. - Be quiet! Answer only when you're asked! How long has it been? Since he made a hole in the wall. It was right at face level. We must have been 4 or 5 years old. A hole in the wall. I'll put a hole in that creep! Let's not exaggerate. Who is the creep? - Mariolino dell'Abbruciata! - That anti-Christ? The one who scored 2 goals and wrecked half my team? If your poor dead father knew you were with a Red... ...he'd die! - Red or not, we're marrying! That's no way, she's too old now to be slapped. Think now, this Mariolino isn't the creep you believe. He's the flagbearer for those mad dogs! You're the mad dogs, and whose fault is that! Poverty drives them. Old greedy men like you! Miss Cristina said you're a Bolshevik priest! I won't listen to you. Go away. You go to your room! You'll leave it when you return to school. [For weeks Mariolino heard nothing of Gina.] [One day he decided to ask for Cristina's help...] [... but Cristina had fallen in her doorway...] [... under the weight of her 85 years.] - Is she feeling better now? - No, she called for the priest. - She wants to see the Mayor too. - The Mayor?! Peppone?! What can she want from Peppone? Would you like me to confess a lot of filth? No, dear priest... ...there is none. I called because I want to die with a clean soul. So I'll tell you. In 1942 your dog, the one with the chopped tail... ...came into my garden and broke a pot of geraniums. I forgive you. - I forgive you for calling me a Bolshevik. - That's unnecessary. I called you a Bolshevik like I called Peppone an ass. Now dear Cristina, to clean what you call your soul... ...you must confess if you want to go to heaven. I'm sure I'm going to heaven. That's the sin of arrogance, no mortal is sure of heaven. No one, except for Miss Cristina. Because Jesus came and told her she'd go to heaven. So Miss Cristina is sure she's going there... ...unless you know more than Jesus does. - I... Ah, there you are! I forgive you for the frogs you brought to school. I know you're not as bad as you seem. I'll ask God to forgive your murders. Miss Cristina, I've never murdered anyone. Don't lie. Your people sent away the King and his children... ...to a deserted island to die of hunger. Don Camillo, tell her that's not true. There were no desert islands, no dying of hunger. They were lies. It wasn't only us, the elections sent him away too. He had more votes against him than in favor. That's how democracy works. What democracy? Kings are never sent away... You are the Mayor. Listen to my testimony. Neither the house nor the furnishings are mine. Give my clothing... ...to the poor. You may keep my books if you have need of them. You must do the exercises and study your verbs well. Yes, ma'am. I want a funeral without music. Death is a serious matter. I want a funeral as in civilized times, with a flag on my casket. - Yes, ma'am. - My flag. The one there, hanging on the wall. - My flag with the King's insignia. - Yes, ma'am. God bless you my son, even if you're a Bolshevik. I think I have another thing to do. That young couple... I have no more time... God will take care of it. You have now heard her last wishes. As we are in a democratic republic... ...I will ask the major parties their opinion. The reactionaries can keep quiet... ...because we know you'd enjoy a funeral enormously. You'd like the Royal March to be played too. In honor of one person, we cannot... ...disrespect the memory of 100,000 men... ...who died to establish the Republic. I oppose the royal flag's display at the funeral. The time of sentimentalism is over. If she wanted the royal flag she should have died sooner. We don't agree with the lightness... ...in which the memory of a venerated person is taken. On the other hand, if we respect her wishes... ...we risk provoking incidents which could offend her memory. Therefore, we are also contrary to the use of the incriminating flag. What do you say, Father? Before speaking, I will hear the Mayor's opinion. As Mayor, I must approve your decision... ...but in this town it is not the Mayor who commands, but the Communists. As Party Leader, I say your opinion stinks. Miss Cristina will go to the cemetery with her flag. I respect her more dead than all of you alive. If anyone objects, I'll throw him out of the window. - Does our priest have anything to say? - I concede to violence. [Things happen in that town...] [... where the sun hammers down on people's heads.] [Fists may be used to reason...] [... but the dead are still respected.] Come in! Gina! - What is it at this hour? - We want to be married. - Weddings require two people. - There are two of us. Why are you here, Mr Cominform emissary? I told you he'd get political. Let's go. No, let's stay. - What happened to you? - His family jumped on him... ...when they saw him signaling me. Damned Bolsheviks! Your people are so nice. They beat you too! You're a bunch of hypocrites! Godless! I'll marry you to scratch your eyes out! - I'll marry you so I can smack you! - Stop that, or I'll beat both of you! The priest, my grandfather, him... ...everybody beats me! What did I do? Calm down and tell me what you want. - We want to be married, now! - You can't. You're a minor, there's a law, you need parental consent. Right, our parents will murder us instead! - Let me think, I'll come up with something tomorrow. - Marry us tonight! - In a few days, it won't kill you. - We'll see. Why do you have to marry this late at night? I've never seen a couple in such a hurry. We can't leave town without marrying. When we're legal, we're taking a train! - I can't. - You're the Mayor, right? You're a minor. You need parental consent. They'd rather kill us! We have to study the law. There may be a loophole, I'll go to Town Hall tomorrow and see. Meanwhile, you can sleep in my truck for tonight and you with my mother. I'm not sleeping anywhere if I'm not married. If we can't marry, we'll marry anyway... ...and you'll hear bells. Come with me, Mariolino. - They're crazy! - You're the crazy one. You men are all alike. Didn't you understand? They're doing something stupid. Maybe they have already. It's not so serious. They are capable of throwing themselves in the river. Didn't you hear her say that we'd hear bells? What bells? The bell in the river... You think that... Those idiots! If I catch them I'll make them forget about... - They'll hear the bells ring. - And may they all be cursed! Don't curse anyone when you're about to die. She's going to kill herself. I knew when I saw the letter. It said: "If we cannot be married..." My poor Gina! You have to find them! Do something! Move! Gina and Mariolino went to the swamp, ring the bells. We need lanterns. I'll take the woods, you the river edge! If something happened to them, God won't forgive any of you! - You could have married them! - What about you? All you needed was an "Oremus". Stop! Leave off! Behave yourselves! Calm down, for goodness' sake. Leave me alone! Listen to me! The banns will be made and they'll be married. Refuse authorization and I'll break your heads! - You're not in command here! - Stop! - Settle your arguments here and now. Do you want to fight? - Yes! Then fight once and for all! - Get the wedding clothes. The Bishop will marry them. - The Bishop? Yes! What do you think, Bolshevik? Go! Now let's get some sleep. - Mr Mayor, what a coincidence! - I'm here because I have something to say. - Look, he's hiding. - Who? - Your friend, Smilzo. What's he doing with the pen? If he draws crows... ...l'll hunt him down. - People who write on walls aren't my friends. - Now I know that, Mr Mayor. - You see enemies everywhere. I want... Come in, I'm painting too. You can give me a hand. Are you getting ready for Christmas? Christmas always arrives sooner than expected. I just came to tell you that you have some nerve. - Get that brush up there. - Do you take me for a sacristan? Inaugurating the park on the kid's wedding day... ...is one of your criminal blows. This way the Bishop can bless the kids... ...and solemnize the family reconciliation. That will make it appear that you did everything... ...and turned water into wine. All to your benefit! So inaugurate the Center too. You know it needs another week to be done. A gentleman wouldn't do this. The Virgin doesn't have a moustache! Look how beautiful. This is Peppone's baby, Peppone's wife... ...and this is Peppone. And this is Don Camillo. So, will you delay the inauguration for a few days? Then it will all be ready and we'll do it together. Alright. Animals always understand one another. [The great day finally arrived.] I don't understand, the Bishop is always on time. Have you seen the Mayor this morning? I want to know what's happening here. [What happened was this: Peppone was trying to win this last contest.] No, leave it there so we can put it together fast. He'll have to use the bridge, he'll be half an hour late. But we'll get to the Citizen's Center... ...in minutes and we'll inaugurate it before he does. - Fine! - Right! Watch out, here he is! Hurry! Take your places! Remember... ...dignified indifference. - An accident? - We don't know, Excellency. It's the Mayor! Excellency! It's only a breakdown. - I see. Can I help you? - I don't think so, Excellency. Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you, Mr Mayor. At my age, legs betray you. Good day, my sons. It seems there is nothing to do. I'll walk there, very slowly... I won't risk falling, you're very robust. Good morning! There he is! - He's walking! - Walking?! He's with Peppone! Pay attention, now! Excellency, we were waiting for you here. Don't be upset, I wanted to take a walk. The Mayor and his friends accompanied me. They are all very kind! Hi, Dad. Accept these humble flowers with love and from our hearts. How sweet, you're very good. What is your name? - He's my son Marco. - He's as nice as his father. - Yes, he is. Will we begin now? - Yes. I'm sorry, Excellency. I must go. - Why the hurry? - I'm inaugurating the Citizen's Center in minutes. - People are waiting for me... - Citizen's Center? - Don Camillo didn't tell me. - But I... - It would be an honour if you came, Excellency. Please come. - Of course. - And the city park, Excellency? - There's time later for that. - And the wedding? - They have their whole lives ahead of them. Here, we have two meeting halls. - Here's the gymnasium, the garden... - It's magnificent... and very useful. The Mayor should show you his weapons warehouse. I'm sure it's not as well supplied as yours. Don Camillo has a mortar buried somewhere. Didn't I tell you he's a dangerous man? You wanted him... so keep him. - This is our theatre. - Thank you. - Have a seat. What a big turn-out! I'm happy to see so many people here... ...and I'm glad I visited this beautiful place... ...with all these useful and pleasant things inside. You're lucky to have one who cares for you. I must leave you now. I must see the beautiful park which completes all this. Goodbye, my sons. - Goodbye, Excellency. - Goodbye, Mr Mayor. [The town had the joy of forgetting its wounds that day.] [There were no more Reds opposed to Blacks...] [... only good people having fun.] How's it going, Papa Filotti? Well, it's going! - Watch out! - Alright, sorry. [While the Bishop napped...] [... Don Camillo...] Well, you know... Bravo! Well done! I wanted to even the score. That thing couldn't trick me anymore. The hinge is blocked. The usual Vatican move... Let's go, Maria. [Political passions...] [... inflamed later that day...] [... and the people began to argue.] [Unfortunately, Don Camillo got involved in the debate too.] Poor Don Camillo, I think you need a change of air. You must go to the countryside for a rest. The mountain air will be good for you. You'll miss the train, Don Camillo. Do you think so? It's an express, it won't wait... ...more than a few minutes. - Just one minute more. Poor Camillo, you know they won't come. I hoped someone would have the courage. Peppone made his threats in every home today. I know. He said if he saw anyone come to say goodbye, he'd break his bones. But, I thought... ...that maybe someone! - Just one of them. - Men are men. Remember Peter, he betrayed me. I'm a poor fool. Alright, I'll go. I'm sorry I can't take you with me. You know I'll be with you anyway. They'll be at the station, maybe in the piazza... Goodbye, Father, have a good trip. Here, Father! All the best! - Come back soon, Father. - Goodbye, Father, have a good trip. Thank you. They're old dell'Abbruciata's pidgeons. I caught them in a trap. Thank you, my sons. Peppone's men said... ...if they saw anyone in town say goodbye... ...they'd beat us up. So we came here to avoid trouble. - Yes. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Thank you! My husband doesn't know, but goodbye! Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Bon voyage! Thank you for everything. Bon voyage, Don Camillo! Before leaving our communal territory... ...the people wished to offer their regards... ...and express the hope that you will repose... ...in your new residence. And you will return soon to your spiritual mission. Ah! I couldn't let us look bad to the reactionaries... ...those pillars of your church! But we are not savages. You behaved like bandits. And you? You fought 12 men and beat them all! I'm sorry I didn't break your head too. We'll fix that when I get back. I'll take care of that weakling priest in your place. He won't get very far. Oh, here... My son Marco drew it. - The boy is talented! - Hm! - Really! - Too bad he has a father like you. - Hm. Anyway, God keep you. May He keep you as well. And make you easier to handle. If possible. [Here's the town in a corner of Italy...] [... on the Po plains. Each struggles in his way...] [... to build a better world. And things happen here...] [... that don't happen anywhere else in the world.]
