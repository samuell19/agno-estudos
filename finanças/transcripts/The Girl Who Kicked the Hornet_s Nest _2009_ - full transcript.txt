Alexander Zalachenko is Lisbeth Salander's father. She threw a fire bomb at him in 1993, and the police investigated the matter. lt was the Security Police. Shit, if it isn't that Salander bitch. - What did he look like? - Like a blond tank. A forensic sketch has been made. Based on witness accounts. - Here. She dropped these. - Lisbeth? Do you think Bjurman got the job just by chance? No. - l should have done it a long time ago. - Here are Björck's files from 1993. - Package for you. - Make some copies. l don't like this. l'm going to be there for her all the Way. l owe her that. Hello, Dad. Where did you find that freak? Do you mean you haven't figured it out? - He's your brother. - What? l've thought about you over the years. Like every time l see myself in the mirror. l hate you. You've been too sloppy. The police Will find you. THE GlRL WHO KlCKED THE HORNETS' NEST PART 5 8120, do you copy? 8120, do you read me? This is the news. A police officer was killed and another seriously injured early this morning. The attacker then left the scene in the police car. The police have no description ofthe attacker but are treating the incident as related to the events in Gosseberga where the wanted Lisbeth Salander Was arrested after a shooting. She's been taken to hospital, where her condition is critical. The police Will hold a press conference later. We've removed a bullet from her head. lt's a serious injury. She's also got bullet wounds in her hip and shoulder. OK. - Will she be OK? - She's stable at present. lf there are no complications, she should be fine. - Can l visit her? - Not now. l'm a close friend. You can wait if you like, but l can't promise anything. Of course, coming. - You think Lisbeth Salander's innocent? - l don't know. Read for yourself. She's been subjected to several juridical violations. lt's all in here. lt's a police investigation from 1993. This is a classified document. Where did you get it? - From Mikael Blomkvist at Millennium. - Where did he get it? You'll have to ask him. Hello. Can you open your eyes? My name is Anders Jonasson. l'm your doctor. This is the Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg. Let's see if you can count to ten. One, two, three, four. That's good. Thanks. Bye. - Have we got any names? - Yes. Holm and Jonasson. Oh, Jesus! You can go in and see her. - Three minutes. - OK. You've got to pull through, Lisbeth. l'd like to report a crime. My daughter tried to kill me. We'll come back to that. First, we'd like to ask you about Ronald Niederman. We believe he's killed one police officer and injured another. Oh dear, oh dear. l don't know what he's up to. But l do know that... ...my daughter tried to kill me last night. There's a warrant out for Niederman's arrest. Do you know where he is? Between you and me, l am starting to get a little bit afraid of him. l'm just an old... injured person. An invalid. We know who you are. We've read your Security Police file. And we'd also like information on three murders in Stockholm. Of reporter Dag Svensson, his partner Mia Bergman and attorney Nils Bjurman. l know nothing about them. Nothing. Shit! Next time we talk to him, we'll need much more to go on. Yes, quite. l'm off to Gosseberga now. Some colleagues have promised to pick me up. - See you later. - Yes. Bye. Hi. Have you been in to see Salander? Wasn't she under sedation? And she still is. Did you speak to Zalachenko? So what did he say? - So what now? - l'll talk to the doctors. Then l'll book a train to Stockholm this afternoon. You can ride up with me. l'm driving. lf you want. - Dr Jonasson will be right with you. - Thanks. l'm going to write and publish Lisbeth's story in our next issue. l plan to tell it all. How the Security Police conspired with psychiatrists to get her committed. - lt'll kick up a hell of a stink. - l'm convinced of it. Until then, you'll have to have that Niederman arrested. The evidence is rather thin. And he's not the type to confess either. No. l need someone on the inside l can trust. l need to be kept in the loop about Lisbeth's prosecution. Sounds like a sure-fire way to get fired. Put him in room seven, bandage him up and l'll pop in to see him later. Good. Give me 15 minutes. l Was Wondering When you'd shoW up. We've been discussing how to help you. ln order to set up a strategy, we need to hear your version as well. What would this strategy consist of? We'll work out the details together. But it will be difficult to avoid a brief prison sentence. Oh, dear. ls that so? We'll provide an attorney and everything you need. But you need to cooperate with us, give us certain assurances. And Niederman? Niederman will be the scapegoat? He shot Lisbeth. There are charges against you that are difficult to overlook. That's your problem. That's your problem. And if you don't take care of it, l will contact the media. l've got names, dates, events, everything. l can blow you out of the water. l'm a survivor, as you should know by now. - Zalachenko, you don't understand. - No, you don't! This conversation is over. lt's 1 1 o'clock and here is the news. After this morning's police killing near Gosseberga, the police have stepped up their search for the killer. The police have identified the suspect as 35-year-old Ronald Niederman. He has short hair and is six foot eight tall. Shut it! He is armed and considered extremely dangerous... No! No! Hello, Lisbeth. How are you doing? Do you remember me? l'm Dr Anders Jonasson. lt's only natural that you're tired. You've had a gunshot wound to the head. We were able to remove the bullet. As far as we can tell, no vital functions were affected. You were shot in the right shoulder and the left hip as well, but you should heal up nicely. Brain damage? Brain damage may take time to manifest itself, but l wouldn't worry. The police have been here, but due to your condition, l've sent them away. l'm sure they'll be back, but for now l won't let them in. ls Zalachenko alive? Do you mean Karl-Axel Bodin? Yes, he's just down the corridor. He's taken quite a beating. But he's all patched up and his condition is stable. Shit. My article will span some 40 or 50 pages. l'd like to include portions of Björck's report in the fax. More impact that way. - What about pictures? - We don't have much yet. We can dig up photos of Björck, Teleborian, hopefully Zalachenko. - Shots of St Stefan's would be good. - And some of Lisbeth. - Sounds like at least 75 pages. - lt might be more. lt's good. Can we get some more names? Björck was just an underling... No. Let's focus on what we've got. And just hope this issue will flush out some more bad guys. That one thing leads to another, et cetera. Let's get to work. Hey. How are you? You look dead beat. l'm totally drained. Do you want to talk about it? Not now. l need to get some sleep. Well, then, l think you should do that. Go home and get some sleep. Her name is Lisbeth Salander. KnoWn to SWeden through police press conferences and tabloid headlines. She's 27 years old and four foot eleven tall. She's been called a psychopath, murderer and lesbian Satanist. This issue ofMillennium describes how several authorities conspired against Lisbeth Salander to protect a pathological killer, Alexander Zalachenko, a former Soviet agent. His many crimes in SWeden include gunrunning, drugs, trafficking and assault. Alexander Zalachenko is Lisbeth Salander's father. Mr Bodin? Come on, let's take you back. This isn't your room. This way. SALANDER STRlKES AGAlN NATlONWlDE MANHUNT FOR KlLLER Here you are. Keep the change. Good evening. l'm here to see Fredrik Clinton. - Who shall l say is calling? - We worked together. My father's resting, but come on in. Zalachenko will do what benefits himself the most, no matter what. That's my opinion too. lf he talks, he has to have proof. And the proof is in the archives, and only there. - So he won't be getting hold of it. - No, he won't. We can't risk him opening his mouth. lt's imperative that he doesn't say a word. We agree, as usual. But you see what state l'm in. Fredrik, we need you one last time. l can't do it. l spend five hours every other day in dialysis. l'm going to die soon. l won't get a new kidney in time. That's just the way it is, my friend. - Thank you, dear. - Fresh from the oven. l didn't know you had a daughter. No. We don't know much about each other's lives. Even though we've worked together... ...for more than 35 years. What about Lisbeth Salander? Now that charges have been brought against her, what should we do? The prosecutor wants Lisbeth remanded for the attempted murder of Zalachenko. But the trial will be about other things equally as important. Like what? What happened in Gosseberga has a long history. Of violence and the abuse of Lisbeth and her mother. That's what you should base your defence on. And here's the evidence. - This is highly classified. - Don't worry about that. You got it from a journalist who won't reveal his sources. DEAR PRlME MlNlSTER. WARN YOU OF DANGER... MURDER... NOTE WELL THE KlNG OF SWEDEN THE ARCHBlSHOP OF SWEDEN THE PRlME MlNlSTER The train noW arriving at platform six is the Stockholm-Gothenburg express. l don't need a lawyer. You're charged with the attempted murder of your father. Micke thinks that they'll try to have you committed again, so you do need a lawyer. But you can choose someone else. Unless you'd rather that the court appointed counsel. Am l supposed to interpret your silence as a sign to leave? lt's your call. You don't happen to have a cigarette, do you? - May l have a nicotine patch? - Sure, l'll be right back. Hello. We need that crash cart over in room three. Micke gave me this copy. l think you know what it is. We're going to have to talk, you and l. And l want you to be totally frank. Micke's told me a lot, but he says there are things you had better tell me yourself. l expect that makes sense to you. Something about computers and a film. After all we've done for you all these years, you threaten us. lt's offensive. l'm a survivor. l do what l have to do to survive. No, you're rotten, evil through and through. You have no sense of honour, no morals. l came here to give you our answer. We will not bail you out this time. You don't have a choice. Life has taught me that there's always a choice. Fools! ldiots! l will destroy you! You aren't going to do anything. No! Stay put. Sorry. l'll go and have a look. Everybody clear out! He's got a gun. Hurry up! Hang on. Lean on me! Hold on tight! l've put an extra watch on all airports and ports. lt'd be wise to keep it up. What's the likelihood that Niederman's fled the country? lt's hard to tell. l think he's still in Sweden. But there's a warrant out for him across Europe. He won't get far. - No girlfriend? - He lives like a hermit. Zalachenko is the only person we know he's had contact with. And we can't get a word of truth out of him. No, but question Zalachenko again anyway. You've read the report, right? Gunnar Björck's. l've skimmed through it. Zalachenko might think he's got protection from his usual lot. Hence his silence. Yes, that might be the case. But we're going to have to keep it out of this. We have no choice. The prosecutor has sequestered the report. What the hell are you saying? The prosecutor says the report is inadmissible since it's classified. Zalachenko's been shot. He's dead. Someone went to the hospital and shot him. You'd think the police would be on guard. Things like this just don't happen, not around here. l mean, walking in here and gunning down one of the patients like that. He kept trying to get in, but we blocked the door. lt was so unreal. An old man like that! With a gun. l heard him shoot himself. - Did he really try to get Lisbeth? - Yes! lt was terrifying! - l've never been so scared in my life! - Want me to come down there? No, l'm staying with a friend tonight. Vera Åkerlund, an old friend from school. - The police press briefing... - l've got to go, Annika. - Take care. - Yes. - We'll talk later. - Yes. - Bye. - Bye. Oh, Fredrik! What brings you...? Come on in. We're trying to get hold of that information. - When? Then find out. - What the hell...? - Have you heard? - Zalachenko's been shot. - Apparently, it was Gullberg. - l'll call you back. lt's a madhouse. We haven't been able to confirm anything. l can confirm it. Evert shot him. According to plan. Would you like some coffee? No, thank you. Not now. What the hell are you talking about? What plan? Gullberg only had a few months left to live. Liver cancer. He elected to undertake one last mission for us. He went out in a blaze of glory. So you knew that he was going to kill Zalachenko? Of course. His mission was to silence Zalachenko, and Salander as well, that was the plan. Are you as screwy as Gullberg or what? Choose your words carefully, Hallberg. lt was the right decision. - We did what was necessary. - Necessary? Decision? You and Gullberg didn't have the right to make those decisions! No matter what happens, Zalachenko's death will not be connected to us. Nor Evert Gullberg, either. Our duty is to make the decisions no one else has the guts to make. Politicians in particular. lt's as simple as that. There's more. l am returning to active duty. l will be in charge of operations until this crisis is over. The man who fired those fatal shots and later took his own life has been identified. He was a 78-year-old senior citizen. A former accountant and tax lawyer. - What about a name? - That is still classified information. What was his motive? What ties did he have with Salander? No ties whatsoever exist. This appears to be the work of a lone perpetrator acting on his own paranoid delusions. He has sent letters to politicians and media representatives raving about how Karl-Axel Bodin deserved to die. Why? The Security Police are analysing the situation, but all signs point to insanity. What does this mean for the Salander case? Nothing at the moment. Bodin had given his testimony and we've forensic evidence against Salander. This man had apparently tried to get into Salander's room, but you claim there's no link. That doesn't make sense. So Why Would he try to get into her room? l can't comment on that. But We have stepped up the police presence at the hospital. ln another letter, he says that Bodin was behind Olof Palme's assassination and had plans to poison everyone with chlorine. Sick, and tragic. But how did he get in contact with Zalachenko? We don't know. He shoots Zalachenko, goes to Lisbeth's room and you call it a coincidence? l don't know! What if he knew that Karl-Axel Bodin was Zalachenko and Lisbeth his daughter? Only a handful of people in all of Sweden knew Zalachenko's identity. - l don't think Gullberg was one. - But what if? lt's about something else, isn't it? - lsn't it? - OK, possibly! But at the moment it looks like a confused old man who lost control. Another thing. The prosecutor has sequestered the Björck report. - What? - On the grounds that it was classified. There must be a connection. l'll talk to you later. Bye. Hey! Give me my bag! Give it back! Shit! This guy drove by on a moped and snatched my bag! - What? Are you all right? - Christ. - Are you OK? - Yeah. But the report Was in my bag. That's all right. l've got another copy at home. l'll get back to you, Annika. - Annika. - Hi, it's me. They've been here and stolen my copy too. l came back to check. - lt's a disaster! - That's an understatement. The Weightiest evidence, the next issue, it's all falling to bits. - Oh, my God. - No... - Fuck, fuck, fuck! - So What are you going to do? l don't know. - What can you do? - l don't know. l've got nothing on Teleborian, nothing on Björck. lt's a disaster! - Sonny. When were you sprung? - This morning. - Magge, too? - No, not anytime soon. - Good to see you. Have you heard? - What? We had a police raid on the same day you got arrested. They didn't find a thing. And that blond giant was here. He came looking for a hideout. That friend of yours and Magge's. He's no friend of mine. The cops are after him. That's why he needed a hideout. So l sent him to Victor's place. Christ. Sonny! Sonny! Fucking hell. Jenny? Jenny! Jenny. lt's me, Sonny. - Who did this? - Nieder... Niederman. Victor. Victor? Niederman. He's going to pay for this. He's dead meat. Nice of you to come over. We don't meet so often nowadays. No, we don't. - Do you live out here permanently? - Yes. - Was it Evert Gullberg who shot him? - Yes. l had no bloody idea. lt was him and Clinton who'd planned it all. l thought Clinton was dead. Not quite. Did he go after Salander too? lt seemed like that from the news. Both were to be silenced, and the trial obstructed. That was the plan. - Will he have another shot at her? - No, it's too risky. But Clinton wants her sectioned again. lt was possible to arrange before. lt feels as if this nightmare began when l gave the report to Bjurman. There might be a link, but nothing that you could've foreseen. But it's on my mind constantly. lt torments me. Don't blame yourself, Gunnar. And now the report and the copies are safe. So on that point, the danger's over. - So what now? - l don't know. But l think Clinton is capable of anything. - Peter Teleborian here. - lt's Fredrik Clinton. l'm assuming that Annika and l have our phones tapped. And to be safe, we should assume the office's are too. And your mobiles. So we're not to talk about this job on the phone. We're to use these. Top-up phones. And we only use them when talking about Zalachenko and Lisbeth. For everything else we use our normal phones. - ls the email secure? - No. So think about what you write. We encrypt the important stuff. - Aren't you overreacting now, Micke? - No. - So the whole office is bugged. - No, because someone's always there. No, l don't think so. No, let's play safe. One of us is to sleep over there. - Let's make up a schedule. - And get lumbago into the bargain. lt's serious. Björck's report was stolen twice on the same day. lt's no coincidence. Zalachenko's murder is no coincidence. They're trying to cover their tracks. - The hospital killer was a nutcase. - That's what they want us to believe! But l don't believe it. Not anymore. So it was the ones protecting Zalachenko who started it. The Security Police? Yes, it could be the Security Police, but we don't know. What we do know is that a great deal of resources are targeted at us. But there's one positive side to this. The ones tapping Mikael's and Annika's phones don't think we have access to the Björck report anymore. They should carry on thinking that. The case against Salander is not a complicated matter. No. Even though Zalachenko has died since then. lf the truth about Zalachenko got out, it would complicate things. lt's about saving lives, Sweden's relations to a foreign power and secrets of state. l read the report mainly for background. lt's not relevant in the case against Lisbeth Salander. And besides, the report has been officially withdrawn. Certain aspects are still useful, particularly since Salander tried to kill her father once before. l could get you access to that portion. That might be useful. Then l'll see that you get it. Who is your superior? My instructions come from the highest quarters. So you are not allowed to discuss this matter with anyone but me. You can count on my discretion. - Björck here. - lt's Bublanski, violent crime squad. Hi. - l thought l'd propose a meeting. - l see. l'm working on an investigation you could help me with. ln What Way? lt's the Zalachenko murder. You knoW things about him. l retired from the Security Police years ago. l Was thinking a friendly chat. Colleague to colleague. Your place? l don't think so. l could alWays send someone to bring you in. OK. Tomorrow after 1 1 . How can he be so stupid as to agree to a meeting? What was he thinking? Wasn't it Björck who handed the Salander report to Bjurman? Yes, unfortunately. - Chow time! - Salisbury steak. - Here you go. - Thank you. Lisbeth? - Do you need some help? - No, thanks. Now eat up. l have a suggestion. l'm not going home. l'm staying at a hotel tonight. Would you like to spend the night with me? l'm beat. l camped out at the office last night. Then we'll just sleep. That's the fourth time l've seen that car there. - Really? - Yes. - Anders Jonasson? - Yes. l'm Peter Teleborian. l'm Chief Psychiatrist at St Stefan's in Uppsala. l would like to discuss one of your patients, in private. Lisbeth Salander. Really? Yes. OK. l've taken care of her since she was 12. l have great insight into her mental status. - Which is...? - Lisbeth is severely disturbed. She has delusions and displays paranoid and schizophrenic traits. And like all sociopaths, she is incapable of empathy. Simply put. Well, she does seem rather guarded. But l wouldn't say she's a sociopath. She's highly manipulative. lt's part of the clinical picture. She shows you what she believes you want to see. As you can tell, l'm concerned about her mental health. l understand. l need to see her. Evaluate her with regard to the upcoming trial. Sorry, l can't help you there. l'm Lisbeth's medical doctor. ln my opinion, she isn't strong enough to see anyone besides her lawyer. l have a court order that says l can see her. l had hoped to skip the formalities, considering we're fellow doctors. And as a doctor, you ought to know my word is law here. Regardless of any court order. So l must ask you to be patient and respect my judgement. Well, then... l was hoping for a more... professional reception. Björck? Shit. Hello. Everything all right? Look at this, please. - How am l doing? - You're getting better. l'll get a physiotherapist to help you with the rehab process. - l don't need any help. - Yes, you do. Leave that scab alone. And you need to eat more. Then do something about the food here. - The food? - Serve pizza or something. l don't think pizza's ever on the menu here. Right. A Dr Peter Teleborian was here, asking to see you. You know each other, he said. At any rate, l sent him away empty-handed. Well, then... Our business was such that we worked together for decades without getting to know each other privately. Those of you who'd worked with Gunnar knew him as a strong, reliable colleague. That he chose to end his life by his own hand... ...is hard to accept. But it was his choice, and that is worthy of our respect. How could the government be in the dark? They'd have to know that a Russian spy had defected. - Otherwise it's absurd. - Yes, absolutely. We had a non-Socialist government back in 1976 when Zalachenko defected. 30 years and nothing's leaked out? Politicians can't keep secrets. Considering all the memoirs nowadays. The same thing goes for the Security Service. Someone would talk sooner or later. lt has to be a small, autonomous and clandestine group. With lots of resources. lf they've been around for 30 years without a leak... - Where do we start? - Our best bet is Evert Gullberg. lfwe find something on him, it might lead somewhere, but it's tough. We need something fast, so itwon't affect Millennium. Our next issue has to be out in time for the trial. - Suicide by hanging? - Yes. Gunnar Björck hanged himself with his belt, that's it. How many other people know that Bublanski called Björck? No one, as far as l know. He knew a great deal about Zalachenko and Lisbeth. You read the report? Björck's dead, Zalachenko's dead and before Gullberg died he'd tried to silence Lisbeth. - Don't you think they're connected? - But we know nothing about Gullberg. Conspiracies are easy to cook up but they're seldom right. But it's right to me. They'll try to get to Lisbeth. Silence her or fix the trial. This isn't Belarus. People don't fix trials in Sweden. And who are you talking about? l don't know. But the threats against Lisbeth are escalating. She'll be violated again. Or suffer something much, much worse. Apparently, this is for you. Dr Jonasson is responsible for her, and his decision is final. That's as maybe, but... l didn't expect him to get awkward and formal. He also referred me to Salander's attorney, demanding a statement of approval from her. ls that really proper? Can an attorney prevent a psychiatric examination? Of course not, and that's not what Jonasson means, either. But his medical judgement we have to respect. She's recovering quickly. lt's just a matter of time before you can see her. An examination like this takes time. Salander's case is a complicated one. l know her. Goodbye. Here are the parts of the Björck report l promised you. Thanks. Good. And one more thing. Doubts have been expressed about Jan Bublanski's leading this investigation. Really? ls Hans Faste taking over the investigation? ls he mad? - The decision wasn't his. - Whose was it, then? Someone who thinks Faste's the right man. l'm not helping that idiot. He's a sexist pig and hates Salander. That's what qualifies him for the job, Sonja. - l heard we're dividing up. - How long have you known this? Since this morning. What, do you think l'm conspiring with Ekström? Can l have the investigation material on my desk ASAP? Sure. By the way, how's it going with Niederman? - lt's going. - l say the bastard's left the country. l don't like this. l do not like it one fucking bit. Hello. We met at the hospital, the night Lisbeth Salander was admitted. - l remember. - l need to talk to you. lf you're after information about Lisbeth Salander, forget it. No, l want to give you information about Lisbeth. lmportant information. A conspiracy like that... l'm sorry, but it sounds pretty incredible. l know, but l can assure you that all of it is true. There's proof, and l'm going to publish the whole story. l'm building a case for Lisbeth, too. That's why l'm here. You see, l'm going to ask you for a favour. - What is it? - Lisbeth has secrets. Private matters that would benefit her in court. And she needs this to access evidence. - The prosecution has restricted... - l know, that's why l turned to you. l've never faced such a serious threat as this. We have to close ranks and strike back. Or do you want something else? l just want to know how Gunnar Björck died. l knew him. He'd never have taken his own life. You can never know that. l met Gunnar two weeks ago and there was nothing to indicate it. You met him? Where? ln his country house. He just wanted to know what happened when Gullberg shot Zalachenko. - And you let him know that? - Yes, why shouldn't he know? And now l want to know how Gunnar died. He hanged himselfwith his belt. - Hi. - Hi. - How are you doing? - Fine. - All right if l have a look? - Yes. - Are you in pain? - No. - What about the headache? - lt's OK. Less and less every day. Another policeman called, said his name was Hans Faste. He's heading the investigation and he's anxious to interview you. Can you lean your head back a bit? Not too far. They are annoyingly persistent. l can't keep them at bay much longer. You're getting too well for that. - Do you understand? - Yes. l told them you need a few more weeks to recover. After that, you will be remanded into custody in Stockholm. OK. Excuse me. That tattoo on your back seems very big. - Why did you get it? - Why do you ask? Out of curiosity. For personal reasons. l don't want to talk about it. OK. l'm sorry. Wow. That must have been painful, and taken hours, too. Yeah, it was both painful and took hours. Excuse me. Hello, Lisbeth. This is your chance to tell your story. Your autobiography. Annika doesn't know you have access to your MlD. Keep it that Way. So this is the man in the black Saab. - Göran Mårtensson. - Coastal Commando. Then police academy. Was on the force from 1991 to '96. He then vanished from external service. The Security Police. He's employed by them but is on loan to Counterespionage. But they've never heard of him. - What does that mean? They're lying? - No... Or that someone's trying to cover up what he's up to. Unfortunately, that's as far as our contacts go. - So what do we do now? - l have an old friend l could ask. But l'd have to tell him everything. - Who's that? - He works with lnternal Security. - He might take things further. - ls he reliable? He's an old friend, Mikael. Right. - OK. l'll be in touch. - OK. lf l'm to sum up What you've told me, a number of Security Police officers have turned a blind eye to a series of serious crimes against a Swedish woman. Allowing her daughter to be wrongly sectioned and a defected Soviet spy to engage in criminal activities. That sums it up well. Plus breaking into the home ofjournalist Mikael Blomkvist and mugging Annika Giannini, Lisbeth Salander's attorney. And the murder of Zalachenko too, now. Ourjob in lnternal Security is to protect democracy from internal threat. Usually Nazis, anarchists... But now you're claiming that the threat comes from within our organisation? Torsten, you can read it for yourself. Speak to you later. You are released from all other duties. Your sole job is to look into this. lf only half is true, we'll have a constitutional crisis on our plate. l'll read the report and find out who Mårtensson was working for. Then l want you to check out Evert Gullberg's background. l've never heard of him, but he must have links with the Security Service. - And report only to me. - Of course. Plague, are you there? Hi, Wasp. HoW are you? - l'm alive. l need your help. - l thought you'd never ask. l need access to the computer of psychiatrist Peter Teleborian. OK, l fix. Send the contents to Mikael Blomkvist's Hotmail address. l'll need your help until the trial. l'll pay you. 30,000. - Cash? - Yes. Mårtensson lives northwest of Stockholm in Vällingby. This is Lars Falusson, an ex-con. Retrained as a locksmith. A craft very much in demand, it seems. And then they wait for Blomkvist to appear. - HoW long Were they inside? - 40 minutes. So Mårtensson had a good poke around in Blomkvist's apartment. - And he saw them? - l didn't get Why he just took off. Until l saw her. She was filming them as they entered. - She Works for Milton Security. - Susanne Linder. - She was a cop until 1998. - So Blomkvist's hired Milton. lt would seem so. The camera is between the lamp and the ceiling. You can fast-forward if you can't bear seeing him pick his nose. You can expect your apartment to be bugged now, Mikael. We can remove it if you want, but that will let on that you know. No, leave it there. l can stay elsewhere. Let Annika have the DVD, but do not Write about the rape. l'll do that myself. That's enough. Have contacted Plague regarding Teleborian. He Will contact you if he finds any dirt. They look too old. Those colours make it look like it's from 1910. - lt ruins the lead-in. - l agree. Take the colour away. Haven't we got a better shot of Zalachenko? Or can't we lift the red? Make it go up. Make it larger. Sure... YOU'RE CUTE lN WHlTE, ERlKA. BUT YOU LOOK TlRED. DO YOU SLEEP BADLY WHlLE YOUR HUSBAND'S AWAY? Hi! l've found our government connection. Guess who went to the prime minister's offices on October 5th, 1976? No takers? Evert Gullberg and someone named Hans von Rottinger. They were there three weeks after Zalachenko's defection. - How did you find that out? - Every visit is registered. And there was only one notation on October 5th, 1976. Good work, Christer. But we need proof. We can'tjust claim they went there to discuss Zalachenko. - Did they write anything else down? - No, just their names and the date. What's our next move? We need to target the undersecretaries. There were two who worked there in '67. - They might know something. - Any names? Yes. One is deceased and the other is a retired ambassador, Bengt Janeryd, who lives near Grisslehamn. - We should talk to him. - Good. l'll do it. l'm more familiar with the material, and l'm more of a threat to him. - That's all l'm saying. - l hear you. What's his address? Listen... You did a greatjob. Ekström. l just got a call from Ekström. - Later. l have my dialysis. - No, this is serious. Ekström had an anonymous call. He wanted to meet to discuss Zalachenko. And crimes that have been committed since the preliminary investigation. - What crimes? - He wouldn't say over the phone. Ekström said he'd call back, and then he called me. Wise move. The caller knew an investigation was in progress and the name Zalachenko. lf he calls again, make sure that Ekström agrees to meet him. And explain that we're taking over now. Stress that it's a matter of national security. Choose a suitable rendezvous. - Ekström? - l called earlier about Zalachenko. l am naturally interested in What you have to say. l'm busy at the moment. Later this evening? - When? - 9pm Would suit me. Nine's fine. You must have realised that Gullberg shot Zalachenko, right? - The story was all over the papers. - Yes. - Why didn't you call the police? - l expected them to contact me. - How convenient. - l didn't know about his daughter. She was treated disgracefully. The PM had no knowledge of this, l assure you. And neither did l. You'll have to convince me and the readers of Millennium. You simply cannot name me in this context! Do not mention me. l have not been involved in any of this. What l read here is all news to me. You've only read a fraction of the material we intend to publish. We have much more. We have proof for everything. This is not personal, but you do have professional accountability. So either tell me what you know or hide behind protocol. - l call that blackmail. - Call it what you like. lf you tell me what you know, l promise l won't publish your name. The PM told me about that meeting in October 1976. He found it all very awkward. He said it was a matter of the greatest military secret in Sweden. So he was under some pressure. How often did they meet after that? Never again. He didn't want anything more to do with it. l was approved as a middleman between him and those in charge of Zalachenko. l had to promise never to discuss the matter with anyone. Which l never did. The prime minister's contacts were Gullberg and von Rottinger. - Have you met them? - Yes. And another man as well. His name was Clinton, like the president. - Clinton? - Yes. How often did you see them? About ten times during my term as undersecretary. But all l ever heard was that Zalachenko was cooperative and that his information was invaluable. - Where did you meet? - lt varied. Apartments outside town. Who did they contact after the change of government? l have no idea. - There was no hand-over? - No. - And you never wrote any reports? - No. No, it was all so very secret. l wasn't even allowed to take notes at the meetings. So this might mean that no government after yours knew that there was a Soviet defector in Sweden? Strange as it seems, that could very well be the case. Hi, Mikael Blomkvist. l'm Monika Figuerola, from Constitutional Defence. Right. l'm here to invite you over for a chat. lt's a friendly invitation. There's no risk involved. - May l pick up my mail first? - Sure. - And change my underwear. - No problem. Torsten Edklinth, Constitutional Defence. - Blomkvist. - Please take a seat. l'm sure you understand why we'd like to talk to you. So let's cut to the chase. We have found evidence of a secret group, a conspiracy, in a particularly sensitive area of government. Last night, the prime minister green-lighted an investigation. What exactly does that mean? A thorough investigation. One that might prompt the state to press charges. But before we get that far, we need time to identify the players. l understand, but where do l come in? Your special issue... lf it's published before we're done, it mightjeopardise the whole operation. So when is it OK to publish it? Well... Naturally, we have no say in the matter. You decide. But we would appreciate your cooperation. This much l can say. l'm pissed off at the government, the Security Services and all the other bastards who committed a 12-year-old to a mental institution without reason and took away her legal rights. l am outraged about what happened to Lisbeth Salander, but the people responsible will be punished. But until then, we must identify them all. l agree, but l also want Lisbeth Salander acquitted and to have her rights as a citizen restored in court. The outcome of the trial is nothing we or the government can influence. As long as l am allowed full access to all information, l will tell you what l will publish and when. lnformation for information. There's a simple solution to this. We recruit our own people for this investigation. Blomkvist could work for us as a consultant. Evert Gullberg. Anyone else? Hans von Rottinger and Fredrik Clinton. The first deceased, the other retired. They were active members of the group in the '70s and '80s. - The group? - Yes. - How about we call it the Section? - The Section? All right. Where did this information come from? A dependable source. - Can we hang on to this place for now? - l'll see to it. On several occasions, Lisbeth tried to tell social services and the police about the repeated abuse of her mother at the hands of Zalachenko. But no one took a 10-year-old's accusations seriously. lt Was only When she tried to save her mother by trying to kill her father that society responded. But not by punishing Alexander Zalachenko for his crimes. Lisbeth Was punished instead. At the age of 12, she was committed to St Stefan's mental institution in Uppsala. When l got there, l tried to explain What had happened to Dr Teleborian. But he refused to listen and claimed l Wasjust imagining things. To shut me up, l Was strapped to the bed as a punishment. For the two years l Was in St Stefan's, l Was strapped doWn for 381 days... Hello, Lisbeth. Did l wake you?
