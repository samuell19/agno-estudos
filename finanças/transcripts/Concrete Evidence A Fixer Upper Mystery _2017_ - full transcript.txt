Hello? Anyone there? You guys, this isn't funny. You're scaring me. What are you doing here? Yup. Okay, yeah. Here is okay? All right, okay, we're ready? Okay, three, two, one. We are here at the new field house at lighthouse cove high, with principal Darren Dean. You must be so proud of this state-of-the-art athletic facility, and the fact that your football team has won championships three of the last five years. Very proud. Bulldogs! And thankful to our, uh, dedicated staff, and your bulldogs are favored to win Friday's championship game, isn't that right? We are, due in no small part to our stellar young quarterback here, Aaron white. He's been working miracles on the field all season... What is that noise? I'll take care of it. Shannon! Hey! Hi. Hey, sorry. I didn't realize the interview already started. Tell Mr. Dean I apologize. No, volunteers can make all the noise they want. She just dropped by for a minute. It was the saw that I needed, and she was kind enough to bring it by. I hope you won't send me to detention, Mr. Athletic director, sir. I'm actually in a hurry to get going. Shannon's starting the craddock house restoration today. Wow. You guys should start calling it the Sullivan house. Mac Sullivan is the owner now. Well, it's been the craddock house for what, a hundred years now? It'll always be the craddock house around here. Yeah, that's fair. - It's probably a losing battle. - Yup. Well, good luck with the job, Shannon. And thank you so much for donating your time to our cause. Go bulldogs. Yeah, go bulldogs! Go bulldogs. Cliff Hogarth, relentless as ever. Hey! Mac! And cliff. Wish I could say I was surprised to see you here. Just thought I'd let Mr. Famous writer here have one last chance to let me have a bid on the craddock job. Which I have kindly declined. Again. Which I was just saying might not be the smartest move. I guarantee my bid will be lower than hers, and... I can get it done faster, which means you won't have to be living in Shannon's little gingerbread shack back there. Just telling it like it is. Well, it is true, I do take extra time because I specialize in quality restoration, whereas QB construction specializes in quick and cheap. Hey, just telling it like it is. I make no apologies about charging my customers a reasonable fee. What do you say, Sullivan? Let me take a gander at your place. I'll float you a number. I appreciate you having my best interests at heart, but I'm gonna stick with Shannon. I admire loyalty. But you might want to talk to the president of the historical society. I think he will recommend me. Oh, yeah, your cousin Ted. How is he? Happen to have his number right here. Oh, you know what, cliff, I was just at the high school. There's this news crew there, they're doing a story on next week's big game. I bet they would love to hear about how you won us our first state championship. Well, well, well, I bet they would at that. Thank you for the heads up. Listen, uh, for you, should you change your mind. You really spent four years in high school with that guy? And I survived to tell the tale. And now if I can just survive him poaching my clients... Oh... Oh, hey, Sean. Meet Mac Sullivan. This is the writer who hired us to restore his home. Mac, this is Sean brogans, my construction foreman. Hey, Mac. Hi. Thank you for standing up for me with cliff. I'm gonna go get to work. I was gonna stop by today, watch you do your magic, and before you say no, I really need a reason to procrastinate. Work on the novel isn't going as smoothly as I'd hoped. Okay, but if you come by, I am going to put you to work. Done. Was that cliff Hogarth I saw trying to steal our client? Oh, my gosh... Yes. The one and only. Man, that guy never gives up. Yeah, if only there was a cure. Wow... I haven't been out here in years. Our official "before" photo. I love my job. Hey. Mr. Foreman, you're on the clock. All right. All right... Who's ready to transform this house? I think what we need to focus on is the corner of the foundation over here, is where I notice the most crumbling. Okay. I actually have a great faux-painter. Remind me to call her. Okay. And... we have marble coming in from Italy. I want to get rid of the tongue-in-groove. This molding is beautiful. I'll have a few fixes. You good? Yeah. Ow! Travis, are you okay? Yeah, it's just this stupid dumbwaiter. It's stuck between here and the second floor, and I just gave myself rope burn. Well, first... You should be wearing gloves. Yeah, that's stuck, all right. Why is that 2x4 there? That's strange. Second, you need the right tool for the job. What? I thought you'd be finished my restoration by now. Yeah. Maybe by lunch. I'd be happy to get this dumbwaiter unstuck by lunch. This board shouldn't even be here. Be careful. My grandmother had one of these, and the one time I tried to get it unstuck... You okay? I hired you to fix my house, not destroy it. What was that? Is everybody okay? The dumbwaiter fell into the basement. We'd better go assess the damage. Ah, the whole thing busted into pieces. Don't... touch it. What? Why? Look. That's human bones, all right. Looks to be an entire skeleton. The impact from the fall must have broken it apart. I wonder how long it's been here? When I bought the house, the inspector gave me a five-page list of all the problems, but "a skeleton in the dumbwaiter" wasn't one of them. Well, kids have been coming here and hanging out for years. Could be a kid climbed in the dumbwaiter, tried to go up or down a floor, and then it got stuck with the kid trapped inside. What is that, that silver thing? Looks like a medical alert bracelet. It says "allergic to bee stings." What did you say? Whoever this was, was allergic to bee stings. Lily had a bracelet like that. I think that looks like Lily's shirt. Who's Lily? She's my sister. Sean, hold on! I'll go talk to him. Sean, wait! Lily brogans, here the whole time. Everyone thought she'd gone to California. You knew her, too? Oh, yeah, everyone in our school knew Lily. She was the lead in every school play. She was super talented. She dated the quarterback of our football team, cliff Hogarth. She'd given this great speech at our graduation about chasing your dreams, and a few days after that, she was gone. That was it? A girl vanishes, there's no investigation? Oh, no, there was an investigation. I still remember the detective interviewing people all summer. But her parents, they were on the verge of divorce, and she always said she was gonna leave after graduation. It became the official conclusion that Lily brogans had gone off to chase her dreams. Dr. Wenders. Officer Sloane. Where are the remains? Right here. Let's have a look. Hey... Maybe it's not Lily. It's her. I know it. That is what she was wearing the last time that I saw her. Here in this room. Here? Sean, I had no idea. She was sitting right here. With cliff Hogarth. His idiot friends were downstairs. She told me that she was going to move away. I didn't want her to go. So I yelled at her, I called her selfish. And cliff, he just... He just laughed at me, and called me a whiney kid, so I left. God, I was so mad. Later, my Mom called me, and told me that Lily had left without saying goodbye. And I thought that was my fault. Oh... And then when we didn't hear from her, I thought that was my fault, too. After my dad died, and then my Mom, I, uh... I hired a private investigator to look for her. He didn't find any sign of her. You know, most people, they thought that meant she was dead. But I... never gave up hope. I know. And she was here, the whole time, just stuck in that... I left her here alone in this room with cliff. You don't think that cliff had something to do with... Tommy sent me to find you. He has some questions for you, Sean. Thanks. We'll be right out. Okay. It'll be all right. Yeah. I also see what looks to me like perimortem breaks in numerous bones, including the skull. Wait, you mean the breaks didn't happen when the dumbwaiter fell? No, I'd assume they happened at time of death. How is that possible if she was wedged in the dumbwaiter, stuck between floors? I could be wrong. I'll know more when I can get a closer look at the remains. Right now, I'd call it a suspicious death. Tommy, I think there's some things I need to show you. I need to speak with Sean first. Where is he? I thought he was right behind me. Look out there. He's taking off in your truck. I think I know where he's going. What are you talking about! You're crazy! Sean, back off now! You were with her! You were the last one to see her! Calm down! Sean! You were the last one to see her... We think we've found Lily's remains at the craddock place. Hey! Cool it! Tommy, the last time I saw Lily, she was alive and well. My friends can vouch for it. And they also saw that you were the one yelling at her that night, so if anybody did anything to her, it was you! No... See, Tommy? Do you see that? He attacked me, and I want him arrested for assault. Cliff, come on. No, no, no, I'm pressing charges. I'm calling chief Jensen right now! All right, show's over, back to work. All right, Sean, turn around, put your hands behind your back for me, please. What? Hey. Tommy, is this necessary? It was his sister. If they don't, I'm just gonna come back here and take that liar apart. Tommy... He did something to her, I know it. Sean, we're launching an investigation, we'll get to the bottom of it, all right? Now, take him down to the car, read him his rights. I'll call ahead, and let 'em know we're coming. I'll come bail you out as soon as you're arraigned. What I care about is making sure that whoever killed my sister pays. You gotta help me make sure cliff doesn't get away with it. Promise me! Okay. Hey. We should tell Tommy what you told me in the car. Hey, there's some stuff I should show you at the craddock house, and the chief should see it, too. All right. The dumbwaiter was stuck between the first and the second floor. There was a piece of wood stopping it from moving. Um... This piece right here. This wood is not the same wood used to construct the shaft. So, what are you saying? Somebody secured this piece of wood in the shaft to keep the dumbwaiter from moving. There's something else. Look at this banister right here, this jagged break. There is adhesive in the crack, like somebody tried to glue it back together. Okay... So where are you going with this? It's a sloppy job, and they didn't fix it. It's more like they were just trying to hide the break. There's more. Now, I noticed this on my first walk-through of the house... These cracks in the tile right here, directly below the break in the banister. Now, the medical examiner said that she saw breaks in the bones that happened at the time of death. And you said it yourself, Tommy. I mean, there's no way somebody could break their bones while being stuck in a dumbwaiter that can't move. Unless that person fell through the banister. Or was pushed. And someone took that body, and put it in the dumbwaiter, and made sure it wouldn't be found. Then this wasn't just a suspicious death. It was murder. Hey. Thanks for coming over, Jen. I can't believe that Lily was murdered. And poor Sean. I mean, you can't blame him for getting a little crazy with grief. I know. I feel like I should have gone to the courthouse to lend him moral support while he faced the judge. He doesn't want you there. You're his boss, it's too embarrassing for him. Then you should have gone. I'm his old boss. Yeah, and you hired him at what, 18? You're the closest thing he has to a father figure anymore. Hey, um... I just went by the house. Tommy said they made a positive I.D. On the skeleton using dental records. They're going to release a statement later today, but, uh... It is Lily brogans. Man... We all expected it, but... Still. You know, I keep thinking about my first day at lighthouse cove high. Do you remember, Shannon? It was sophomore year. It was Lily who volunteered to show me around the school. I mean, do you really think it's possible that cliff Hogarth could have... Killed her? I don't know. I promised Sean that I would help him find out. And why you did that, I don't know. Dad, I've worked side by side with him for years. He asked for my help. The least I could do is go talk to cliff. No. No, cliff's too volatile. You need to stay away from him. Well, I could talk to him. I mean, I could tell him that because the work's been delayed, he might as well come and give me a bid on the restoration. If he thinks that he can get my business, I might be able to get him to talk about Lily. But shouldn't you be writing? Oh, writing... You know, that's sort of... A subconscious thing anyway, and you wouldn't want me to let my skills as an investigative reporter get rusty. Oh! Oh, my gosh, you know who's going to be devastated is Lily's best friend from high school. Denise Jones. Yeah. She's, um, she's the drama teacher at the high school now. We should really, we should go there, and we should tell her. You're right. But Sean's going to be calling any minute. I'll post bail for Sean. You break the news to Denise, okay? - Okay. - Thanks. I'll go talk to cliff, see if I can get his story. Thanks. Wow. This place hasn't changed a bit. Touchdown! And the bulldogs win another state championship! Yeah, and the football players haven't changed much either. Right? Yes, everybody loves the bulldogs. I'll see if we have any more tickets. I'll see if she's here. Please hold. Wow, I'm having such a memory rush. This is where I first met Lily. Like, right in this spot. Hey! Shannon... Are you back to finish the snack bar? Um, actually we're here to see your wife. You remember Jen? Sure, yeah, yeah, good to see you, Jennifer. Hey, Brad. So, why do you need to see Denise? Uh, we have to give her some news, about Lily brogans. Haven't heard that name in a while, not since she left town. Um... Brad, Lily's body was found yesterday at the craddock house. She never left town at all. They, um, they think that she was murdered. Oh, man. That's rough. Oh, that is... That is gonna hit Denise hard. I'll go get her out of class. But first I should tell Darren. Oh, sure. Hey, Darren... Oh, that's right. I forgot, that vice-principal Dean, he's now principal. It's so crazy being back here. So I'll go get Denise, and she'll meet you in the teachers' lounge. Thanks. I don't suppose you remember where the teachers' lounge is? How about I show you where it is? Brad told me about Lily brogans. It's very upsetting. We're worried about how Denise will take the news. I'm worried about the students as well. News of the murder of a girl their own age, a girl who was also a student here, they could be thrown for a loop. Right. So please be careful in how you relay the news to Denise? Of course. Thank you. I'll go call the district psychologist, make sure she'll be around the next few days. Here you go. Thank you, principal Dean. Wow, I've never been in here. When I was a kid, this seemed like a secret, magical room. I know. And now here we are. Cliff? Cliff? Hey! I thought I might find you here. Yeah? Why is that? Well, um, uh, with construction on my house being delayed, I thought I might take you up on your offer for a bid. Oh. Oh, yeah, we could talk about that. Um, talk to Kimberly, my secretary. She'll make an appointment for you... Well, if you have a couple minutes, I'd love to do it now. Sorry. I gotta get some plans filed with the city. Talk to Kim. Okay, I might be getting rusty. Denise... Hi, Shannon. Hi. Hi. I haven't seen you in ages. I know. So, Brad told you? That Lily's dead? Yeah. We didn't want you to have to hear about it on the news. We are so sorry. We know what good friends you were. Yeah. She was my best friend. I remember thinking, though, how strange it was that Lily would have left without saying goodbye. I should have trusted my instincts. It seems like we all should have done something different, just should have known somehow. I just can't believe it. Excuse me. It's my dad. Okay. Hey, dad. How's Sean? I imagine not too good. I got tired of waiting, so I went down to the police station, and Tommy told me that Sean's arraignment won't be until tomorrow. What? Why? I don't know. He wouldn't tell me. I'm going to go down there right now. Okay. I'm on my way to see an lawyer friend of mine, see if he can help. All right. Love you. Thanks. - Bye-bye. - Bye. Hey, you guys, I'm so sorry, but I have to run. That's okay. Yeah, it's fine. I'm gonna stay a little while longer. Thanks, Shannon. Bye. Hey, why is Sean still sitting in a jail cell? He should have been arraigned today. Chief Jensen wants him to cool his heels another day while we follow up on some leads. What do you mean, leads? You arrested him for attacking cliff. Show me your badge, I'll be happy to discuss that with you. Hey... You know my dad and I are the closest thing that Sean has to family in this town. Fine. You know the gist of it already. You were there when cliff accused Sean of fighting with Lily the night before she disappeared. Yes, Sean admits that. Well, we pulled a case file on the investigation done on Lily's disappearance. Two of cliff's friends that were with him that night at the craddock place reported seeing a car sitting outside the house when they left. We asked cliff about it yesterday. He remembered the car. He says he thought Sean was driving it. But Sean left before cliff. That's why he was so upset yesterday. Cliff was the last one to see her. Or Sean waited for cliff and his friends to leave, and then went back inside. Are you telling me that you think Sean is a suspect in his own sister's murder? Let's just say he's a person of interest right now, and we don't want him taking off, okay? What? So, Sean attacked cliff? I don't understand. Why would he do that? Well, he said that cliff was the last one to see Lily alive. He was with her the night before she disappeared, so... What? Why would cliff be with her? Well, why wouldn't he be? I mean, he was her boyfriend. Well. Not exactly. What do you mean? What are you guys doing here? Denise needs to talk to Tommy. To tell him what? That Lily broke up with cliff the day before graduation. Really? Yeah, Denise told Tommy all about cliff and Lily's rocky relationship. He called cliff, and asked him to come in for more questioning. And this supposed break-up didn't come up when they were investigating Lily's disappearance? Well, it happened at the end of the school year, so not many people knew about it, and then she went away for a vacation with her family, and the police just never interviewed her. Huh. Well, let's see what Hogarth has to say for himself. I'm about to invite myself onto his boat. Uh, ask him about the car he said he and his friends saw sitting outside the house that night. Yes, ma'am. Hey! Your secretary said you'd be here this afternoon. Permission to come aboard? Granted. All right. ...well, finish re-rigging the sheets, and replace the halyard. I'm getting it ready for a trip down to Mexico this summer. Aw, that sounds like a good time. Wow. Yeah, it will be. Boy, I'm enjoying that beer. Well, I hope it gets me a couple bucks knocked off the restoration. Well, it might at that. Good. And I felt bad. I heard you got grilled by the cops again today. You following me around? Nah, small town. People talk, you know. Heard they wanted to talk about you and Lily breaking up right before she disappeared. Yeah, like it's some big old secret. Right? And you guys were going in separate directions anyways. She was off to Hollywood. You got a football scholarship to... University of Michigan. Michigan? Yeah. Girls must have been lined up to date you. Yeah, they were. Trust me. And you and Lily stayed friends. I mean, you saw her the night before she disappeared. That's exactly what I told Tommy. You know, she called me that night. She had a jacket of mine that she wanted to give back. Well, her brother showed up and started giving her grief. My guys and I left right after he did. You know, Tommy reminded me about something. When my friends and I were leaving, we saw a black car parked under a tree just to the side of the house, and Sean was driving his dad's car in those days, and I'm thinking it was black. Boy, Sean was really yelling at her, his face all red... Maybe he waited for me to leave, and went back in to finish their fight. Maybe he pushed her, I don't know. So, am I gonna bid on your restoration or what? Absolutely. Attaboy. So, if it was a black car that cliff and his friends saw, then it wasn't Sean. I happen to know that Sean borrowed his dad's car in high school, and it was green. How do you remember that? Um... I backed into it at the grocery store parking lot, with Mr. Brogans in it. Oh... What? It was my first year driving, and in my defense, my dad's truck was huge. I would love to have been able to see that. The incredibly able Shannon Hughes miscalculating something? Oh, what, so your first year of driving, no Fender benders? No. Well, I drove my sister's corolla into a ditch, but that doesn't count as a Fender bender, because the Fender was not bent. It was crushed. I totaled the whole thing. She's still mad. Well, it's a good thing we didn't grow up in the same town. We would have crashed into each other left and right. I'm sure we would have. So, back to work. Um... When the police say that we can get back into your house... Oh, yeah, they already told me you can go back in. Guess they didn't find much in the way of evidence. Really? Nothing? Well, they weren't going to find much 20 years after the fact, but at least now we can get cliff to give us the quote. And see if his story holds up. Good. Because I know Sean did not hurt Lily. So, how are you, Sean? Are you doing any better? I'm hanging in there. I'm just glad Shannon got me out of that jail cell. It was ridiculous to ever suspect you. This is ready to go, honey. Oh, good. I went through my old high school box, looking for photos of Lily. You know, in case you want to hold a memorial for her sometime? Um... yeah, I'll think about it. Okay. Well, I found all kinds of stuff, and Brad scanned it into a video, and... It's still a work in progress, but we thought you'd like to see it. Yeah. Okay. ♪ Fly... ♪ ♪ Like a raven... ♪ ♪ Black honey ♪ ♪ into the night ♪ [♪♪♪[ ♪ soft... ♪ ♪ Like the air beneath ♪ ♪ a swan... ♪ Seriously, Lily? You have to write in that diary even at dress rehearsal? For the famous memoir I'm going to write someday. ♪ Dream... ♪♪ Are you guys hungry? I made some sandwiches. Uh, yeah, that'd be great. Thank you. Okay. Do you want to start the coffee, honey? So Lily kept a diary? Yeah, she used to write in those blank journals all the time. She'd just fill them up, one after the other. Do you still have any of them? A couple. They're from when she was younger. Then when she got older, she would hide those things where nobody could find them. Hide them where, her room? Anywhere but there. My Mom was nosy. I don't know, I mean, the last time I saw her write in one of those was the... craddock house. Sean said she used to sleep in here sometimes. If she felt safe enough to sleep in here, I bet she felt it was a good place to hide her diary. But where's a good hiding place? I don't see too many possibilities. You're a writer. Use your imagination. Look what I found. We didn't read through the diary while we were waiting for you. I would have bet money on it. Anything I should be looking for? Most of it seems to be Lily writing about how much she wanted to be in the movies. Or how she was afraid her parents might get a divorce. But there were a few things that surprised me. She was failing math, and she talks about wanting to hire Brad Jones to tutor her. I didn't know Brad tutored students. I wish I'd known that, I barely made it through trig. Is there anything about cliff? Not a lot, which I don't get. I mean, her boyfriend? She does talk about a fight that they got in after she accused him of cheating. I mean, we saw that coming. But the most surprising thing to me is how she talks about Denise. She calls her quote "two-faced," said that she lied about her to the drama teacher. Lied about what? I don't know, this is the last page of the diary, and she wrote this a good month before she died. Huh. You know, her brother said she used to fill diaries, like, one after another, so we were thinking she might have another one hidden somewhere. Probably somewhere in this house. We searched it thoroughly, although we didn't find this one. Guess it is possible. I can bring another team in to search again. I'm about to tear this place up to renovate it. I can just let my crew know to keep a look out. That'll do. I can't believe I let you talk me into this. I mean, do you really think that Denise and Brad are going to believe we're here to give them cookies? Why not? Everybody who stays at your B&B loves your recipes. And who wouldn't love getting one of these baskets? You really don't think that they're gonna know that we're here to grill them? Don't think of it as grilling. Just think of it as... Reminiscing. Hey, Lois, we're here to see Brad. He's with a student, should be out in a minute. You know, it's too bad you didn't find more of Lily's diaries yesterday. I know, but... We're not giving up. We searched the second floor yesterday, and we're going back tonight to search the ground floor. Okay. Why don't you talk to Brad, and I'll go talk to Denise, and then we can get this over with? Okay. Okay. No, governor, we've got two VIP seats saved for you for the big game... Yeah, okay, all right. I'll see you after practice. Yeah, at 4:30. Tell me that kid doesn't remind you of cliff Hogarth. Yeah. Hey, walk with me? I need something from my other office. - Yeah. - Okay. Shannon was going to replace the entire underside of the eaves. She said the wood was starting to rot. You want to keep telling me what she was gonna do, or do you want to hear what I would do? Come on, everyone around here knows you're the king of construction. You got that right. I like the name of your company, by the way. Must have been cool to be a big football hero. I was a bookworm, the opposite of cool. Yeah, I can see that. But that must have been crazy. I mean, having girls chase you around. Yeah, well... I was with Lily. Right. You must have had fun with some other girls, too. I mean, how could you resist? Aw, it wasn't hard. You gonna want double-pane windows? Uh, yeah. And make sure you factor in the cost of searching everything that goes out the door. What do you mean? One of Lily's old diaries was found upstairs, so the police think there might be another one hidden in the house, so whoever does the renovation is gonna have to keep an eye out. Probably a waste of time. But... I mean, you knew her. Do you think she would have written something down that would point to her killer? Oh, I don't know. I-I've seen enough here. Um, I'll, uh... I'll send you my quote. Okay. Tell Jennifer I said thanks. I will. I told her about the montage you did of Lily. She's trying to talk Sean into a memorial. Yeah, I don't know that he's keen on the idea. Well, if it does happen, I know Denise would have amazing stories to tell about Lily, even if they fought sometimes. That's what you do in high school. Wow, these are nice digs. Yeah... Yeah, I like it back here, you know? I'm closer to the coaches, I'm closer to the athletes, but it does smell a little like old tennis shoes. So, what about you? If we had a memorial, would you have some stories to share about Lily? Oh, no, I doubt it. We just, we weren't that close. But you did tutor her, right? Yeah, how'd you know that? Hardly anyone knows that. I read her diary. I found it at the craddock house, and she wrote about wanting to hire you. You found Lily's diary at the craddock house? Yeah, one of them. There might be more. I'm still looking, but... Why is it nobody knows about you tutoring her? Well, she just, she didn't want anyone to know. You know, we couldn't have cliff getting jealous, now, could we? Why would cliff get jealous... Kaitlyn Instone's parents are waiting in my office. Is it 10:30 already? Okay, I'm coming right now. Excuse me. I'm sure Brad won't mind. Cookie? Yeah. Of course, there's lots of money for football and sports, and I know that some of the football money pays for other things, but does it ever trickle down to the arts? No. Back when we were in school, it was so different. Lily and I used to order costumes from a catalog. Really? Can you imagine? She'd always order the most expensive one, too. Oh, we had a huge fight about it this one time. We both wanted to order the same costume. Oh, we got so crazy about it. What, that's all it was about? Oh, Denise, I'm so relieved. I mean, Shannon, she just, she made it sound like it practically ended your friendship, and... What? What are you talking about? Oh, just what Lily said about you in her diary. Shannon found her diary? Huh, the light's out. One more thing to fix. Huh, that's weird. Someone left a heater on? That's not like my guys. This heater is stressing the connection. It's too much amperage. Okay, this was not my guys. They know better than to use a household extension cord. Well, who was it? Don't touch that, you'll burn yourself. That's turpentine. Do not let that sawdust catch fire. This whole place might go up in flames. Wh-where you going? I've got to kill the power! Right. You okay? I found this in the breaker box. Someone used it to tie off the switch, so it wouldn't trip when it over-amped. Uh, what does that mean? It means somebody tried to burn down your house. That, yes, someone deliberately tried to set your house on fire. And they tried to make it look like an ordinary electrical fire. Yeah, no one would have suspected arson. Your house would have been a heap of ashes by now. Okay, but I don't understand. I mean, you've already done the crime scene thing with all the tape, and you already have all the evidence that you're gonna find... Yeah, so why make the house go up in flames now? Good question. Well, we think someone was trying to eliminate the chance of finding more of Lily's diaries. No, that can't be it. I mean, me and the chief are the only ones that know that you found the first diary. Um, Brad knows. I told him. And I told cliff. And I told Denise. Great. The way gossip travels in this town, anyone and everyone could know by now. Shannon, I want your word you'll stay away from that house till I tell you different. Fine. Well... Looks like work on your house will have to be delayed for a while. Yeah. Hey, I wouldn't be rushing over there after such a close call. Oh, I wish we'd got there sooner. I think we just missed whoever set it up. Yeah, it can't be just anyone. It has to be somebody that we told. Like cliff, or Brad, or... Don't say Denise. I really like Denise. And, yes, she admitted to having a fight with Lily before she died, but it was over a costume. You said she seemed nervous about the prospect of someone finding another diary. Okay, yeah, but... Brad acted funny, too. He said Lily wanted to keep his tutoring her a secret, so that cliff wouldn't get jealous. I wish there was a way to get closer to Brad and Denise. Yeah. Hey, didn't you say Denise was complaining that the drama department was hurting for funds? Yeah. I think I know a way we can spend more time at the school. When Jennifer told me you were willing to help build the set for the play, I was thrilled. Well, since I just finished the Cassini contract, I might as well put the time I allotted for the craddock house to good use. Oh, fantastic. Okay, so I've signed you both in for the volunteer log for today. Ooh... I feel so official. You are, you're an official angel. So, come with me, we'll go get some fabric for the costumes. And Shannon, I'll come back to take you to the wood shop and show you the materials we have to work with. Okay, um, but Brad could show me if he has time. Even better. Just ask him. Okay. Thank you. Hey. Do you have time to show me where the wood shop is? Yeah, it'll cost you a nickel. And we gotta make a pit stop at my other office. - Okay. - Okay. So, set-builder, that's a new one for our volunteer roster. Yeah, it's kind of like snack bar-builder. Man, when you walk down these hallways, do you ever feel like you're back in school yourself? I sometimes I get that time travel sensation, yeah. Do you ever wish you'd dated Denise back then? I think things happen when they're supposed to happen. What about Lily? Well, you mentioned yesterday that, uh, Lily didn't want cliff to know that you two were spending time together, so it just made me wonder if anything happened with you two. So, where is this coming from? Is this more diary stuff? No, I'm just curious. Really? 'Cause it kind of feels like an accusation. Look... I want to know what happened to Lily as much as anyone, but she and I don't have some deep, dark history together. I tutored her three or four times. That's it. Go on, get outta here! Chill, I was just talking to my girlfriend on the phone. This is not a student lounge! I'm not gonna tell you again! Mike, I'll take care of it. Aaron, can you hold up? Aaron... Aaron! Hey, can I talk to you for a second, please? Hey! I remember you from when I went to school here. You're Mike, right? Do you remember me? Not so much. I only remember the troublemakers, and that kid there, Aaron white, he does whatever he wants, just 'cause he can throw a football. Well, I'm sure Brad will straighten him out. You're such a joke... Hey... Aaron. Aaron... More like the other way around. Well, the bid is self-explanatory, and it's in the right ballpark, but, uh, I do have a few questions. Well, let's hear 'em. Well, if I have to add security, is that something that I'd go to you for, or do I contract with another company? Well, I'll get you a better deal. Good. Good, because, uh, last night, someone tried to burn my house down. What? Yeah, rigged it to catch fire. That's crazy. Yeah. Police say that it might have something to do with Lily, like someone's afraid that more diaries are gonna be found, but I read the first one, and it's pretty dry reading. Though there was a funny bit about her being mad that you got better grades than she did. Well, I don't know what you're talking about. Lily was always smarter than me. They always are. What's up, cliff? You know that car? No. No, and you know what? I'm tired of all your questions. I'm tired of you talking about Lily all the time. I'm tired of the whole thing. I don't want anything to do with your house. I'm withdrawing my bid. Wait... You guys are awesome. Thank you for staying late to help me with these costumes. Are you kidding? This was so much fun. Tonight, I'm gonna look through my pattern book, and find some good costume ideas. Perfect. Oh, Denise, don't forget, volunteers have to sign out when they leave? Oh, right. I'll do it. I'll meet you guys outside. Thanks, Shan. All right. Thanks, Shannon. Like I said, the district was aware of Denise's record. Well, it surprises me that you'd overlook a battery conviction when hiring a teacher. The incident happened when she was in college. It's not unusual for young people to have difficulty managing their emotions. She passed cur psychological screening with flying colors, had a solid work history, excellent references. And I'm sure having her husband lobbying for her didn't hurt. If you're suggesting I can be persuaded to make decisions against the best interests of my students... No, I'm not questioning your judgment, Darren. Good. Because Denise Jones is a dedicated teacher, and the sooner you can clear her from your suspect list, the happier we'll all be. Okay, then. Thank you for your time. I wasn't expecting to see you guys on my doorstep. You should have been. What do you mean? We were told that someone tried to burn down the craddock house. With you in it. Oh. That. Why didn't you tell me? I didn't want to worry you. Well, now I'm twice as worried. Shannon, your dad is worried that maybe looking for Lily's killer is too dangerous. You're darn right I am, and you should never have asked her to do it. And you shouldn't have agreed to put yourself in the middle of it. Dad... Look... I know the way your mother died still haunts you. And I know that you don't trust the police to do the job... That's not what this is about... But will not have my daughter put her life in danger for you or anyone else. Do you understand? This stops now. Let the police handle it. Please. I am sorry that I got you in trouble with your dad. Hey, he's mad at you, too. Yeah. Hey... Do you want me to drop this? I know I don't want you getting hurt. That's not really an answer. I'm sorry. That's all I've got. I must be losing my touch. I mean, the way that cliff grabbed the quote and then walked away? That never would have happened when I was on my game. Um, can we have a table for two, please? Thank you. See, this is where you're supposed to say, "oh, no, Mac, "you haven't lost your investigative edge. Cliff is just a tough nut to crack." Or, he's just worried all of his secrets might come out. I'm sure Denise is. She loses her temper, right? Well, she did at one point, but... I still don't see how all the pieces fit together. At first I thought Brad and Lily were having a secret romance and cliff was jealous. Now I'm thinking maybe it was Denise that was jealous? Okay... So, tomorrow's back to school again for you, huh? Okay, this sounds silly, but when I walk back in there, I feel almost like I'm 17 again. I feel insecure, and awkward, and like I don't really know who I am, or what I'm doing. My dad scolded me today. He thinks I should leave everything up to the police. Literally scolded me. Phew. That made me feel like a kid, too. Hey... This is where you tell me that I'm doing the right thing by finding Lily's killer. That would require a certainty I don't have right now. Um... I have a giant case of writer's block. I thought I had this great, like, true crime novel in me, but I'm a hundred pages in, and I can't even get into my protagonist's head. I quit my job to write this novel, so, uh... I'm chasing around this mystery with you, relying on your certainty. You're gonna have to tell me. Is trying to find out who killed Lily brogans the right thing to do? Yes. Absolutely. See? I knew you'd be certain. Your unwavering moral compass, it's one of my favorite things about you. And, uh, I love how you, um, drum your pencil when you're poring over your building plans. Really? Is that the best you got? I love that you bite your lower lip when you're thinking. More coffee? Thank you. Aw, man! Are you still going? How am I supposed to sleep with all that noise? I'm pretty sure you're supposed to be in class. Yeah, only if I want to die of boredom. You look tough, you'll survive. Besides, you have to have passing grades to play football. I know the whole school's counting on you to play Friday. Oh, I'm gonna play. You don't gotta worry about that. So, are you worried about what Lily wrote in her diary? Why would I be worried? Oh, just because the police, they might consider you a suspect in her murder because they know about the big fight. Even though I know that it was just about a costume. Well, it'd be dumb to think it's me. I know something that could point them in the right direction. Only, Brad keeps talking me out of saying anything about it. What? I mean, why would Brad... Because it's about cliff. I don't know, it's weird. Brad's been protective of cliff, ever since school. So you're saying that you think that cliff killed Lily? When Lily broke up with cliff, I asked her why, and she said that she knew something about him that could totally ruin his life. I thought she was being over dramatic then, but now? Hang on. You're kidding me. Um, can I give you that? Of course. Okay, thanks. Hello? No, I'm not listening. You can't say that. What are you talking about? It's ridiculous! No, I'm not listening to you if you can't say that this isn't true. Hey, Mike? Mike! Hey, you're looking for Mike, too? Yeah, um... I was looking for 16-penny nails, I thought he might have some. Well, it doesn't look like he's here, and I have a meeting to get to. I've gotta get sponsors to buy banners for the game. Hey, if you see him, will you tell him one of the showers in the boys' locker room is leaking? - Yeah. - Okay. Hey, Shannon. Hey, can you find a reason to talk to cliff again? Uh... maybe. What's up? Remember how Lily called cliff a cheater in her diary? I don't think she was talking about romantic cheating. Ask cliff if Brad Jones ever tutored him in high school, and then ask him if Brad ever helped him cheat on tests. Okay, got it. Hello? Cliff! Anybody here? Cliff? So, how's cliff? Any news? Yeah, um, the doctor says that he has 20 stitches in his scalp. Ow, poor guy. Yeah. The ct scan said there wasn't any damage, but he hasn't regained consciousness yet. Hmm. So, what, you just found him on the floor of his office? His equipment room. But, yeah, the door was wide open. Secretary said they were working a large proposal, cliff sent them to a late lunch, but he never showed. Hmm. So... Do they think it's an accident, or... Good thing you were there. Right? Hey, Tommy. What's up? I guess you heard cliff Hogarth is in the hospital. Yeah, Mac just told us. Well... This is what put him there... ...and it's got your name on it. You don't think that I hit cliff, do you? Of course not, but I need you to tell me who might have gotten ahold of your wrench. Did you lend it to anyone? No, uh, it was in my tool box this morning. And where's your tool box now? At the school. I've been building a set for the school play. Anyone could have grabbed it. All right, well, I better go ask cliff who paid him a visit. The doc says he's still unconscious. Okay, well then, I guess I'll wait for him to wake up. I'll go with you. I want to make sure he's okay. That's a... That's a good idea. You guys go ahead, 'cause Shannon and I, we have to, um... We have to go somewhere. What? What is the hurry? I think I know who took your wrench. Who? Hi. Hey, can we come in? Yeah, come on in. Would you like some coffee? Denise... Cliff was attacked. Oh. That's terrible. Denise, I overheard chief Jensen telling principal Dean that you were once arrested for battery. And we know that you believe that cliff, he's the one that probably killed Lily... That's not why I... Jenn saw you standing next to my toolbox. You reached in it and grabbed one of the wrenches, didn't you? Then went down to cliff's office and hit him with it? That phone call I got when we were talking? That was cliff... Demanding to know where Brad was, telling me that it's Brad who killed Lily, telling me he's gonna go to the police. I had to talk to him. I took the wrench to protect myself against him, and he laughed at me when he saw me standing there with it, said I didn't have the guts to hit him with it. Turns out I had the guts. What was I supposed to do, let him keep lying about Brad? Are you sure it's a lie? Are you sure that Brad didn't... Yes, I'm sure! I know Brad like I know myself. He's a good person. So why did cliff think Brad had a reason to kill Lily? What did Lily know about Brad? Nothing. Lily knew things about cliff, not Brad. I'm sure cliff killed Lily. That's why he's trying to put blame on my husband, and that's why I... I shouldn't have hit him. I was just so upset. I know. Hey, listen, if you like, I'll take you to the police station, and you can just tell them what happened. Okay, um... I'll go get my purse. Would you mind getting that, Shannon? What are you...? Let's save that for later. Cliff woke up. Is Denise here? Yeah, come on in. Easy, buddy. Easy... whoa. Easy. You can lean on me. Nope. I'll be fine right here. I just gotta... Wait for the world to stop spinning. You should have let them keep you an eye on you tonight like they wanted to. Ah... Ten years playing football, I know how to take a knock to the head. Thanks for the ride. I... I found you. I felt responsible to make sure you're okay. Ah, I'll be fine. But what a coward Brad is, sending his wife to do his dirty work. Why you so sure that he sent her? I told you I saw a car that night, right? The last night I saw Lily? Yeah. Three round taillights, glowing in the dark. That car you were looking at in your parking lot had three taillights. So it was an impala that night? Mm-hmm. Oh, wow, that's cold. Yeah, at the time, I thought that was Sean's car, but you know who drove an impala in high school? Brad's brother. I told Tommy all about it. I should never have told Lily what Brad did. What did Brad do? Help you cheat on some tests? So you could continue playing football? Ow. I tell you what, go ask Brad. Seriously. And then, come back and tell me what he says. Thank you. Have a good night. Brad? Hey... You okay? I was supposed to meet, uh, Denise for dinner. She just called, she's been arrested for... For attacking cliff Hogarth. What? Oh, it's all catching up with me, Pete. Can I help with anything? Do you want me to give you a lift down to the station? Uh, no... No, I gotta go. I gotta... I gotta stop this train before it's too late. Oh! Shannon... What are you doing here so late? You know, I forgot my toolbox in the auditorium. I just have to grab it. Oh. Okay... Just make sure the door's locked behind you on the way out. I will. I'll be quick, I promise. Okay. An athletic director with test keys. I'll put this back. Hey! Rotten kids. That's it, then. Proof that Brad Jones is helping students cheat, and that cliff knows. Because he was the first. I'm just, I'm so shocked. I mean, why would Brad do this? I gotta call Tommy. Who's that? Hang on. I'll go check. Dad? What is it? What's wrong? I just ran into Brad. It was the strangest conversation. He told me that Denise had just been arrested, and then he acted like it was his fault, and said, "it's all catching up to me." Did he say anything else? Yeah, that he had to stop this train before it's too late. We need to warn cliff. Chief... We came to talk to cliff. Is everything okay? Tommy found him an hour ago, shot in the chest. He's dead. It doesn't seem possible. Cliff Hogarth dead? Yeah. I couldn't sleep last night. Looks like Tommy couldn't sleep either. Oh, hey. Chief said you'd be coming by. Come on in, have a seat. I think we might know who killed cliff. Mac was the last person to see him last night... We already know who killed cliff. It was Brad Jones. The judge already signed a warrant for his arrest. His fingerprints were all over cliff's front door, and apparently, he's skipped town, because he's nowhere to be found. We were afraid of this. I found him, you know. I took over a photograph of the impala that Brad's brother owned 20 years ago to see if he could identify it, and, um... There was a half empty beer bottle sitting on the coffee table next to this. Our high school yearbook. Yeah, it was lying open to photos of him and Lily. Reminiscing, I guess? Hmm. Brad goes in and kills cliff, and then takes off, while his wife's sitting in a jail cell? I just don't understand it. Then you need to see what Shannon found. I found this at the school. Test answers. Okay, is this all I need to sign? - Hey... - Thank you. How's she doing? I think that she's in shock, you know? Once she's bailed out, I'm gonna take her home and stay with her till her Mom gets there. Good. I don't believe what they're telling me. Brad shooting cliff? He wouldn't do that. He's the calm and steady one. He doesn't even have a gun. I am so sorry. Maybe it was cliff's gun. Maybe cliff tried to shoot Brad, and then there was a struggle for the gun. That has to be it. Okay, okay, right, but you know, right now, Denise, let's just get you home. Yeah. I need to go home so Brad can find me if he needs me. Yeah. Yeah. - Okay. - Okay. That is one tortured woman. I know. She can't even bring herself to believe her husband's done anything wrong. Well, you can't argue with the evidence. Yeah. It does seem airtight. Then why that look? Doesn't it seem too easy? You just spent the last 24 hours trying to convince everybody it had to be Brad. I know... All right, Mac, let's get that statement out of the way? Yeah. I'm just gonna swing by the craddock house to pick up a few things. All right. Okay, so then cliff said you should ask Brad what he was talking about? Yeah. Hey, Tommy, you got a minute? - Be right back, Mac. - Sure. I just talked to Aaron white at the high school. Now, he admitted that Brad Jones gave him the answers to math tests on three different occasions. So Shannon was right. Apparently. There you are. Shannon Hughes... "I just found your yearbook photo." What are you doing? I just came from cliff's house. I know what happened! You've got to leave it be... No! It's over! What's over? It's all over! Everything is over! We need to come clean and just stop everything! Tommy! You don't get it! Okay? The police are trying to blame me for something I didn't do! I could go to prison for the rest of my life! - That should have been... - Or worse! Okay, I know it was you who killed cliff. Don't try to deny it. I told you to shut up! Wait. Wait a minute. What are you doing? Hey... stop. Stop! Stop... stop it! Have you lost your mind? Gasoline? Burning this place down is not going to make it all go away, diary or no diary! I said shut up. Where are you going? Stop... Please, just come back. Hey. Who Mr. Dean! Don't move. Darren, what are you doing? Would you just put the gun away? I told you to shut up. Tommy? Something wrong? Look at this. Look at this picture. Brad Jones did not kill Lily. "Mr. Dean gets his car washed"? Look at what car it is. Black impala. Taillights, three in a row, just like the one cliff saw that night. I'll put out an APB on Darren Dean. I've gotta get to Shannon. Where is she? At craddock mansion. I don't understand, why were you giving test answers to students this whole time? Because I told him to. Look, I knew it was wrong, but it meant so much to the school. So why did you kill Lily? I didn't kill Lily. I came here that night to talk to her, to make sure she planned to keep quiet about cliff. She panicked... ...flung herself away from me. The banister broke, she fell. I thought about going to the police, but it wouldn't have brought her back. And why drag the school through the mud, make my students pay for something that happened by accident? I've worked hard to make up for it, to give the students in my care every chance to succeed, no matter what it took! Yes... And I've worked too hard to watch it all go down the drain now. Yes... Darren, no! Brad! No! Might as well... The lock... Okay... Come on, Shannon, pick up the phone. Okay... Let's get you to the hospital. Ooh! Ah! Ow! I'm sorry, I just, I can't put any weight on it. I'll call you an ambulance. Where's my phone? I wouldn't worry about the phone! Hey... You don't have to do this. Look... You said it was an accident. The police are gonna believe you. We'll just go down to the police station. It's not too late. Sorry, Shannon. Told you these things were dangerous. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, an attorney will be appointed to you. If you decide to answer questions now without an attorney present, you will still have the right to stop answering at any time until you talk to an attorney. You know one of my favorite things about you? What? Your timing. I broke ten different traffic laws to get here. You know, um... The thought that something might have happened to you... I never want to feel that way again. How did you figure it out? I didn't even suspect principal Dean until he literally grabbed me. Uh, a picture, in your yearbook. Turns out principal Dean had a black impala, with the three taillights. You must be pretty proud of yourself. I am. It's funny how a whole case can be solved with one little detail. One of the detectives I interviewed for my book said that. Too bad she's not the protagonist. Maybe that's it. I picked the wrong protagonist. I should follow the woman detective, the one with the eye for telling detail... The one that reminds me of you. Brad, are you here? Oh, honey... I'm okay. You're okay... I'm okay. It's over. I'm sorry. I am so sorry. Hey... Come take a break, I want to show you something quick. What is it you want to show me? I finally found this. In here. This is Lily's last diary. I thought you might want some time with it. Thank you, Shannon, for, uh... For this. Just... for everything. Of course. - Hey, stranger. - Hey. Haven't seen you in a while. Well, that's what happens when writer's block goes away, can't pry myself away from my laptop. It's going well then? It is, but I wanted to see how work on the house was going, and... Thought you might be a little hungry? My new favorite thing about you? Bringing me food. Aw... that's nice. Well, I'm going get that list a little bigger. Oh, yeah? Yeah, I think so. Well, let's start by building a kitchen. That's a great place to start, because I'm a good cook. I've noticed. I like that.
