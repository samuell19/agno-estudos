Let me tighten it. Keep going. Good. Bigger. Good. Stay strong. Faten, bring a longer stick. I'll do it. It's down ! lt fell down ! Mom, take this, keep it with you. Look, I know that truck. SIMPLE AS WATER YASMIN ATHENS, GREECE What's this one ? This is Faten, dad, and Mahmoud. Who's this, Mahmoud ? - Who's this ? - It's me. That's daddy. Yes, that's dad. Midyooni ! It's baby Midyooni. Mama, show the one where he's dancing. - Put it there. - No, here. Everybody can see but me. No, you all can see. Sit back down. Everyone's in my way. Get back to your spot. Yes, you need to stay where you are too. All of you can see. He was an angel. Wasn't he ? There's you, Ahmad. He's coming to the camera. Don't cross this line. I'll be back in 10 minutes. I won't be long. Yes, darling. I'll call you back in a few. But my husband is in Germany. How can he be in one country and we get asylum in another ? Since her husband is at German, she can apply for asylum here in Greece, and then tell the people from asylum service, that she wants family reunification. She can go and pre-register. Until the day of the interview, her husband must have sent her a copy of the travel documents, and an invitation because he must be a recognized refugee. At German. Ok ? How long is her husband there ? Ten months. He doesn't have his refugee papers yet. Does she live here at the port ? - Yes, two months here at the port. - Two months. Do they have kids also, or are there the two of them ? Do you have children ? - I have four children. - She have four kids. How old are your kids ? Nine, seven, six, and five. Nine, seven, six, five. - Girls or boys ? - Girls or boys ? The eldest is a girl. The others are boys. The eldest one are girl, and the others, they are boys. Probably because she's a single woman with four kids, for example, kids... maybe she has a chance to find a place. Of course, she has to know that we don't have a lot of shelters, and they are already overcrowded. You can ask about housing shelters. Because you're a single mother with four children. It might be hard to find, but you have the right. It's Ok ? - What does she think ? - Thank you. This is giving me a headache. Eventually, I'll just go back to Syria. There's no war there. And no airstrikes. - Didn't he tell you that ? - Yes. Where does dad live in Germany ? Your dad lives in a very big house. - With who ? - He lives with other guys. They cook together and eat together. And they sit and spend time together. If we go there, will we live with them ? No. We'll get a house and live on our own. How many times did dad try until he made it ? Your dad made it on his first try. But he went in summer. There was no rain or wind. Did they have children with them ? Yes, but not many. There were 19 children on our boat. How many times did we try to get on the boat ? Seven times. We succeeded on our seventh try. I only remember the last time. I don't want to go to Germany, because we let my brother slip from our hands, Come on, that's enough. Do you want to leave your dad there alone ? Yes. But he loves all of you. He should come to us. We shouldn't have to go to him. We'll get a house and you'll go back to school. And when it's safe at home, we'll go back. Right ? Yes ! Follow your siblings. Go ahead. Be brave. Yes. Go in there. Go further in. Yes, more. Yes, go in. Jump like this. Take it off. It's cold. Scrub, scrub. Quickly. It's Ok. We're almost done. Come ! How are you ? How was your day ? I can hear you. Where are you ? I didn't hear from you today. I'm calling you now. Did you ask about your residency ? I asked, but they said I have to wait. Things are more difficult now. So you've checked with them ? Yes, I have, but I don't know when I'll get my papers. God willing. If you receive residency, which papers would we need ? For residency, you need to go to the German Embassy there and see which papers they need. I don't know what the procedures are. Hopefully, you'll receive it. If I receive the papers, it might take two or three months until you can come here. They said here that reunification takes from six months to a year. - So there's nothing new ? - Not at the moment. - I'm worried about you. - I'm fine. Faten wants to say hello. Hello, Dad. Hey baby, how are you ? Faten is speaking. How are you, daughter ? I'm good. How are you ? Hope you're doing well. - Hello, dad. - Hi, Hammoudi, how are you ? I'm good, praise be to God. What did you eat today ? Rice. Was it tasty ? No, it wasn't. - You didn't like it ? - No. Hang in there. Hopefully you'll come to me soon. Hopefully. And soon, all of this will be just a memory. It only has 9%. We'll see what happens when he gets residency. God willing. His residency papers... laid eggs. It's going to take a while. SAMRA REYHANLI, TURKEY Welcome. Tell me about your situation. I have five children, and I'm here to register them at the orphanage. But my eldest son doesn't want to. So you have five children. Your eldest son... - Fayez. - Fayez, how old is he ? - 12 years old. - 12 years old. Tell me about your family's situation before you came to Turkey ? We had a little shop to earn a living. My husband did business with the regime. And ultimately, they took him. They arrested him. And we haven't seen him ever since. We had a happy life before then. Every time... I look at my kids, I remember the good life they had. I'm afraid for them. Why do you think it's best to register them here now ? Because I can't support them. I can't do it, there are five of them. It's a big responsibility. Especially because I have twins. And my son Moussa, who's five years old, doesn't speak yet. I have to go to work each morning. Do you work in a factory or in the fields ? No, I work in the fields. I leave at 4:30. - 4:30am ? - Yes. So you're not home when they wake up ? I'm not, but Fayez is there. When I come home from work, they run to me, kiss me, and start taking off my gloves and socks. So they take care of you, and attend to you. Yes. Then Fayez comes... Tell me about Fayez. He says, "Mom, sit with us a while. We don't see you enough." I tell them, "I'm exhausted and need to sleep." So then he leaves me. He understands that you're tired, but at the same time, he wants to be with you. He follows me around and asks for my blessing. Fayez does that ? Yes, he keeps saying the same sentence: ''Mother, I want you to be pleased with me." He keeps following me around saying, ''Kind mother, I want you to be pleased with me." Did you ask Fayez to be responsible for his siblings, or did he start that on his own ? No. That's how his dad was. He was good to his family. He loved his family. Affection is very good. The fact that he takes care of his brothers, and that he's a friend to you is very good. But at the same time, Fayez is a child now. - He should live his childhood. - That's true. If he takes the role of an adult, he's carrying a responsibility beyond his age. I'm really uncertain. I'm... - Hesitant. - Hesitant. Until this very second, I've been hesitant. And I have a fear inside, that's hindering me from registering them. Fayez is everything to me. After his father was taken, he became everything to me. They're not on. Give it to me. Do this. Here. Here ? Keep going. No. You put it on. You put it on. Good job. Take this. Well done. Fayez ! I'm coming. Want to come with me ? That's enough. Moussa, Hammoudi doesn't like that. Not nice ! Hammoudi, tell him it's not nice. That's not nice. See, Hammoudi is telling you it's not nice. Stop it. Hammoudi feels like wrestling like John Cena. Fayez ? Fayez, has he been sleeping long ? Are you hungry ? Hungry ? Blood. Where ? Did he bleed ? When ? Did his nose bleed ? When ? Did he fall ? Leave him alone. Here you go. Fayez... - That's enough Hammoudi. - Sit. Sit. Fayez... What's going on inside you ? You don't want to go ? Should I ? This is Bayti. This is the living room. Here you can sit and watch soccer matches. We'll now go to your peers who are Messi fans. This might be one of the classrooms you study in. Who likes Messi ? They all like Messi. Fayez likes Messi too. Who cheers for Messi's rival team ? - Cristiano Ronaldo. - Cristiano Ronaldo. Who's a better player, Cristiano or Messi ? Should I introduce you to the Messi fans or the others ? With Messi. Then these are the peers you should be with. Meet Fayez, he might join our family. He loved me the most. My brothers used to hit me because he loved me so much. Your brothers were jealous that your dad loved you so much ? What do you remember about him ? Come visit. I want to see you. I miss you. I miss you. Yeah. This way. We'll see the bedrooms now. These mountains are in Syria. Can you see the Atme camp ? - We stayed there. - Oh, you stayed there ? Can you see the blue tents ? You can see it from here. It's very close. I work around there. - Oh, so you work close by ? - Yes. This way. One of these beds will be yours. Tell me why this room has six beds. Because it's a corner room. - What else is special about it ? - It's big. Would you like to be in a room where you'd have five mates and you'll be the sixth, or to be in a room where you'll have three friends and you're the fourth ? Miss, I don't wish to be here. Why don't you want to be here ? I don't want to, Miss. It's better at home. Your mother can visit all the time, and your brothers will be here with you. You can really feel at home here. Sit down. What makes you say that, when this could be like your home ? Home is better for my soul. My mother is there. I understand you want to be with your mother, but don't you want to go to school ? It's too much, Miss. I lost my father, I don't want to lose my mother, too. But what if your mother is close by, and can give you all her love, warmth and attention ? Miss, it's better for us to stay with our mother. When your mother is away at work, during those hours, do you feel burdened taking care of your younger siblings ? Don't you want someone to help you with this task ? - No. - Why ? I can manage alone. I want to be their father. I want to be everything to them. If you want to be their father and everything to them, shouldn't you be well prepared for that ? - Yes, Miss, but... - Right ? Miss, I don't want them to feel they've lost our dad. So tell me, Fayez, would you accept our invitation ? Miss, I can't look at these children. Which children, your brothers ? No, at those children. My heart breaks for them. You feel bad for them ? Give me a kiss. Kiss, kiss, kiss. Come on. Who made you fall ? - I fell. - Who ? By yourself ? Give me a kiss. What do you want ? What do you want ? What do you want ? A candy ? I can't be away from my home. I don't want you to leave me. I wish you could stay with me, but, I have to... and you're not willing to accept it. Didn't you see how the kids in the orphanage were living ? It's a life of humiliation. - Humiliation. - Why is it a life of humiliation ? They're far from their mothers and families. I need to stay with you. OMAR PENNSYLVANIA, USA Hello. Here you are. - Have a nice one. - Thanks, you too. Hello Can you hear me ? We got disconnected. Yeah, he plays video games a lot, but there's no way around it. He's living his life, and that's all I want. I'll figure something out, God willing. I don't want him to worry. You know, he's happy. I'm not going to let him down. He's been to other schools and he's been successful but the fact that we have to move, it just cuts him off and he has to start all over but you know, doing so great in this school year, I really don't want him to lose it. You know, my main goal for him this year was just to connect and feel a sense of belonging at the school and I really think like he has achieved that. So it's not straight A's, but considering he's had a transition to several different schools and he's learning the language and learning the culture. And he's taking one of the more advanced math classes for the 9th grade and he was the one that wanted to take that class. And so I think he pushed himself to do it and I admire him for doing that. This is good. I mean I don't expect him to just kind of be the best of the best, even though I wish. But he moved himself up a lot, and that's great itself. It's not... I mean he knows, that you... I don't know, I don't know if it's pressure, but he knows that he needs to be successful. Like he knows that's important to you, and that he wants to make you proud. I'm grateful for everything. I'm grateful for the fact that he's, he's trying. That he's not stuck with the past though of what happened with him. This covers for everything else. You know, the fact that he's happy, he's making it. It covers for the little bit of slack that he's doing but that's great. Did you hear what the barber told you ? - What ? - What he told you about your mustache. So you've been shaving it alone at home ? Yes, the mustache. - He is brother ? - Yes. - He's got nice hair, right ? - You have a different mother ? - No. - Why do you have a different hair ? - What ? - Really, you're gonna say that ? When I was in university, I had spiky hair. Why ? - It looked nice. - That's silly. No, like you don't know. It really looked nice on me. I tried it once. I tried that style like myself when I was in college. I'll show you my friends. All Syrian guys had spiky hairstyles a few years ago. I don't like it. You don't know the hairstyle I'm talking about. You think that it just spikes up, but no, they smooth it and then flip it around. 1 It's really nice. And it's not too high, it's light. If you don't wear it too high, it'll be nice. - I don't like it. - Your loss. I'm still gonna chase you wherever you go. I'm good. If you leave it right there, it's gonna die. Just don't touch it. You gotta protect it. There were fighter planes. A rocket came down near our house. I went to see what was going on. Mom woke me up. Stand up immediately. What's, what's happening ? She said, Abdulrahman went out and the airplane is roaming, circulating above and you need to get him back to the house. Once he saw me, he shouted, Omar. Shouted with all his strength. I saw his leg and he just yelled. I was crying. I couldn't also console myself. He said, please don't cry. If you love me, don't cry. He had nightmares. And sometimes day dreams, bad day dreams. And he kept saying to me, when are we going ? When are we leaving ? Yeah because once every time the firing jet comes, he says, when are we leaving ? We should leave. You know how far they can go ? They can go maybe all the way up to... They, I think they travel international. I am not sure. This river is long. Sneak on one ? ...into the international water, huh ? Want to sneak on one ? Luckiest shot in the world. Luckiest shot in the world. One. Do you already... do you have your grade for the year ? - Yeah. - And can you show me ? I am passing. - No, I want to see. - No. - Let me see. - See what ? - Your grades. - They're not here. I can go on a parent, what do you call ? Parent portal ? Yeah. Okay, one second. I'll show my grades. Let me just change this. Look how many zeroes you got there. You did not submit ? Yeah, but it's a 90. So don't worry about it. - Still, you should have been seeing... - 98 in (inaudible) class. And 79 in Health. Where is math ? Told you this is 78, right ? - 78 only ? - Yeah, right here. So, do they have college planning ? Not for freshmen. - When do they start ? - I don't know. Some other grade. You know, I haven't gotten a good job. Why do you think that ? - I don't know. - Because I lack credentials. I don't have any credentials even though I may be good at things but I still. If you don't have a bachelor's degree to present for someone, they are not going to take you regardless, you know. Okay ? I'm gonna wake you up before I go to work. Okay. - So you don't miss your bus. - Okay. - Hello ? - Hello. You're sleeping now ? You sleeping ? Are you sleeping ? Yeah, it's Omar with Gerhards. I tried to look up your address. It's coming under, you know, in Philadelphia. And it says, Flourtown. So, do you mind telling me what the actual address is ? I shut it off. Alright ? Can I meet you upstairs, get a signature ? - Yep, you're a good man. - Thank you. - You just need a signature ? - Ah yes, there and there, please. - Do you want to lean... - Let me just get my glasses. Sit down. Relax, guys. You go ahead. Do you wanna use this book ? Put the paper on ? Yeah. Boy ! Hello. Thanks. Hello ? Which exam ? Biology test. I didn't know you started studying. Take a picture. I want to see your name on the board. All right. Smart boy ! - Omar, how are you, my friend ? - Steve, how're you doing ? A few things I wanted to go over with you today. We've had this decision from the asylum office that has decided not to grant your application. Okay. So, one of the things that they noted is that you're barred from asylum because they say, you have engaged in terrorist activity because you fought with the Free Syrian Army. That's not labelling you. It's not something I want you to carry around, and think of yourself as, my goodness, the government's called me a terrorist. If they thought you were terrorist, you wouldn't be sitting here with me today. - And then there's Abudi's case. - Yes. As you know, your applications are independent of each other. At the end of the day, he gets asylum and you have to get asylum separately. And there maybe ways that we could, especially given his injury and his profile, that we could somehow if you were granted asylum, get you to stay as his caretaker, as his guardian. And especially, as long as he's under 18. So it's one thing we should explore. If Abudi's granted asylum, how to use that in a way to get you to stay here for him. And as long as I can just be next to him, supporting him at least here because even if I don't have a status, I can still be around and work and support him until he can you know, be on his own. - He doesn't talk about it like at all. - Right. He's trying to just stay away from the things that he cannot handle. - Yeah, it's very healthy. - Yeah. - Just be a normal 16-year old. - Yes, yes. But you've done a really good job with him. And I, I also wanted to tell you that, we've been considering traveling to Canada trying to apply for asylum. But I wanted to ask you, what do you think ? So I think that's not an unreasonable option at this point to explore. I do think given where we are with Abudi's application, it would be premature to go to Canada. But I think your application in particular would be stronger in Canada than here. So the one thing, you know as we finish here that I want you to understand is that you have lot of process between here and anything happening to you. You'll be able to work, you'll be able to support Abudi but we'll focus first on Abudi's case, then on your case. And we should continue discussing and looking at whether there are other options like Canada as well. If that... I don't I don't think that's an unreasonable option. At this point though, I think if we can get Abudi asylum here, that could solve a lot of the issues. - You alright ? - Yeah. Yeah, well, we'll try another avenue maybe. Yes. - Thank you. - You're welcome. 5, 6, 7, - Alright, I got to 21. - 8, 9... - 22. - No. - 23, stop. - No. - 22. - No. - 23. - Try again. - I already won. I already won. - No. I'm so good. What are you doing ? I got you. DIAA MASYAF, SYRIA They kept waking each other up. May God protect them. Raising children is not easy. So, Rasha... What does your heart tell you ? Are the people ISIS took still alive ? Are Mohammed and Samar Ok ? My heart is telling me they're fine. My heart tells me it's only a matter of time. My heart is telling me... There is hope. There is hope. I swear I want to go there. We can go. I can go. It's risky, Auntie. The people in control now aren't any better. For my son, I'm willing to travel to the end of the world. Even if it's for nothing. I will not accept it. SDF forces battling ISIS have secured 70% of the city of Raqqa. Please leave a message. Hello, dear. Hello. I heard that as a mother I can go to Raqqa and ask about my son... in hopes of finding out some information. So I wanted to ask you about it before I go. We haven't found anything. You found nothing. Did you get any news ? No, we haven't. But I think the Syrian Democratic Forces might have them. If SDF had any detainees they liberated from ISIS, if they had them, they would've said so. So that's your opinion. I have a good relationship with SDF, and I asked them. But they didn't have answers. They don't have answers. Yes, they don't know. Because the prisons were mostly empty. So we don't know where they went. Right. I haven't lost hope yet. I haven't either. Some people have lost hope. Some people have, true. What nice hair you have. You want cologne ? That's it my Yazan. Yazan. Come dear, come. It's too sunny for him. Today is sunny. It's Ok, leave him. Enjoy your tea. Relax. With rising fighting between SDF and ISIS forces, civilians are fleeing Raqqa. Are they still finding bodies ? Yes, of course. They might have taken him. Faten told me there were still prisoners. She said there were still prisoners. Then where are they ? No one knows. No one knows. I want to check on the walnut tree. Come this way. - For what ? - I want to check on the walnut tree. If there are walnuts on it. Are you having fun, Yazzouni ? Do you remember when we sent some to Mohammed and Moayad ? Did you forget ? Hopefully next spring Mohammed will be back here with us. Take it. Take it. My dear, is it good ? How beautiful. Come here. So beautiful. Let's take it home with us. Let your dad smell it too. Let dad smell it too. I don't know why it's doing this. You should transfer it. He used to take good care of his teeth. They were so white. Transfer these pictures and get it over with. If you don't have a flash drive, I'll bring you one. It's not about the flash drive. Should I go get you a flash drive ? Look at his smile, his face. The Jawzars' kid knows how to do it. Yes, Ok. The black fish is Sharky. The lighter one is George. Here we are at Khaled's house with his fish. Today we'll teach you how to catch Sharky. Who is considered the hardest. Of course, there are two methods to hunt. Like this. You have 3 milliseconds to snatch the fish. Or the sneaky method. You come up slowly from behind. I will use the sneaky method. Come on sharky. Call me once they're gone. Please write to me. Is it true there's a prisoner exchange between SDF and ISIS in Hasakah ? Like you posted on Facebook ? Is it reliable news ? You remind us of Mohammed. Do you know what I mean ? That's what I think. His father thinks so, too. We've missed you, Moayad. I miss you more, Auntie. Honestly, here in France I try and forget about home. It's like a black hole in Syria swallowed all my friends. But I never stop thinking about Mohammed. He lived in this house like a breeze. We're going to get old, Moayad. I don't know if we're going to grow old gracefully, but he'll always remain young in our minds. No matter how old we'll be, his image will stay in our minds... In case he doesn't come back. Put your head here, my dear. Yazan, do you know that you and Mohammed look alike ? You look like Hammoudi. Don't you look like your brother ? Yes my son, you look like Mohammed. Yes my dear, when he was your age. He came back from Egypt after we sent him there. Without even telling us. I made him go away. That's how the mothers are nowadays. I forced him to leave, he didn't want to. I told him, "Mohammed, you have to leave. That's how I can protect you. Nothing is left in Syria except death and devastation, my son." But he didn't listen. Mohammed used to say, "Mom, don't be afraid all the time. What is meant to happen will happen." And I would answer him, "How can I not be afraid ?" When you came home from the intelligence prison to Masyaf, I made you tasty food. And you slept on this couch next to me, like Yazan is sleeping now. You slept on my arm just like this. I helped you put your socks on with these hands. You never showed your pain. When you said ouch, I asked you what happened. I looked at the bottom of your leg and found burn marks all over your legs, from the beating and torture. I asked you, "What did they do to you, Mohammed ? What happened to you ?" You said, "It's Ok." I remember that you said, "I was lucky, Mom. You should see what happened to other people." After everything that happened to you, you still thought you were lucky. Mohammed, you left Egypt and came back without even telling me. You were so close with me and I didn't even know. He loved you so much, Yazan, but he used to pinch you and tease you, right ? There's so much to remember. There's so much to remember, Mohammed. It's been five years and I'm still waiting. Waiting for you every single moment. I'm waiting for you my sweetheart. SAFWAN BUTZBACH, GERMANY Yes. Ok. Is it a sunny day there ? Is it sunny ? I just finished work and I'm going home. Fine, I'll call you when I get home. Ok, bye. Can you see me ? Hi Dad. How are you ? - How are you ? - I'm good, how are you ? - When are you going to visit us ? - No, you're going to come here. When can we come to you ? Soon, baby, soon. I wish you could bring us there to be with you. I want to show you something. Look. It has horses ! - Hi Dad. - Where are your teeth ? - I can't see them. - Here they are. Dad, mom said she'll get me a gold tooth. - Don't lie ! - You did. Dad, he wants a gold tooth, but I told him they're for old people. I'll get him a gold tooth when he comes here. Where's Mom ? Yasmin ? Smile, I want to see your teeth. You look lovely. My teeth ? Have you seen Mohammad's ? When are you going to the agency ? - I think next week. - Why ? - They've closed the booking for now. - What ? The refugee authority told them not to process any bookings. When I get home, I'm going to call you again, Ok ? - Ok. - Ok, goodbye. It's my youngest son Hammoud's birthday. He told me he wanted a piano. - Happy Birthday to him. - Thank you. He wanted a piano. I saw that my co-worker had one, and I offered to buy it. Show it to me. Does it work ? If he comes here, I'll give it to him, but if he doesn't... Hopefully, I'll see him again. I tested it for him. I tested it today. If I see him... - It works. - Who did you buy it from ? A guy I work with. Stop it. So if the kid ever comes here, God sent this to him. May God bring your family to you safe and sound. I'm going to call Abu Faris. He's supposed to be getting off work now. Would he fix my hair ? We'll see. I'll tell him to bring his tools. - Yes, have him come. - Have you seen my phone ? Where's my phone ? Hey Abu Faris, close your eyes and open them, and your wife and kids will be here. God willing. Hopefully, you're next. Did you ask your wife if she's arriving in Frankfurt ? Yes, in Frankfurt. - To Frankfurt. - Yes. And they'll take her to the camp ? No, they said she can come to her husband, if I find a house. - Right away ? - Yes. And if you don't have a house ? Then she has to go to a camp. Where else ? So when your family arrives, Abu Faris, they can come straight to you ? That's what they said, but I don't know exactly... I told Safwan, I need someone with a huge brain, a political expert, to analyze my case. I just need him to give me a solution. He's won. Bashar al-Assad has won. Our people won't be able to lift their heads for a hundred years. We've hit rock bottom. - What ? - We've hit rock bottom. He humiliated us. And the whole world saw it. Still, you need to be patient. More than this ? This country can help you. What else can you do ? Thank you, Abu Faris. Really nice work. I looked in the mirror. - It looks good, Safwan. - Why, thank you. How are things in Syria now ? My wife now... she's in a lot of pain, and my seven-year-old son said, "Please, mother, don't die and leave me now." - The kid is talking about death. - He said, "Don't die on me." My son Mohammad He threatens his mother. He asks to go to school, and she tells him he's not allowed to go to school in Greece. So he goes to the window and threatens to kill himself. A ten-year-old is threatening to kill himself. Two years is like a lifetime. Hammoud told me I'm all talk. You can't do anything about it, but he doesn't know that. Hopefully, things will work out for you, and God will provide. and your family will come here, and you'll be with them. All safe and sound. I don't know. They said, "When is your dad coming back ?" What did you say ? In about a month, or so. But you're coming here. I'll throw you a birthday party when I see you. I want to celebrate with you. How are you, sweetheart ? I really miss you. Don't you miss me ? - Hi, Dad. - Hi Farouq, how are you ? - Praise be to God. How are you ? - Praise be to God. I miss you. I miss you a lot, Farouq. - I miss you more. - You miss me more ? When are we coming ? I really don't know, Farouq. I've been waiting and waiting. I'm tired of waiting. Why didn't you fix the gas problem today ? Your mother told you to. Why didn't you fix it ? Why didn't you ? I wasn't at home. You weren't at home. And, why do you stay out late ? Why do you keep playing outside ? Mother is sick. All I do is bring her medicine. That's Ok. There's no one but you to stay with Mom. Our 8-year-old son has to carry the responsibility of a 40- year-old man. You can't come here, and we can't come to you. Please, stop. You're sick. This isn't good for you. I wish I was there. When you got sick and had the surgery, and went through chemo, I wish I'd been with you. I'll make it up to you. You know I love you. What has your love done for me ? It makes me suffer more. Ok, Bayyouni. Take care of yourself, and take care of the children. We'll talk tomorrow. I heard you speaking to your family. It's the same every day. Arguing, arguing. The problem is she got sick. She's in Syria, during the war, she's sick and scared, Of course you're going to have problems when you call. What can I do ? Everyone left. We had no choice. I feel ashamed. How could you tie the fate of an entire family to that unknown ? When you got on the boat, how could you know what would happen ? I lost a son that way. It's going to be the five of them. One, two, three, four, five, and four suitcases. - What ? - How's it going ? I'm a little stressed. I don't know. That's normal. Stay with the car. Thank God you're safe. How are you ? - Praise be to God. - Thank God for your safety. How are you ? I'm so happy to see you. Was the trip alright ? - Everything was fine. - Thank God you're safe. Come, let's take the bags. - How are you ? - Look at my new bag. Ok, bring it and let's go. How are you ? Wow, you're so big now. Come on. Oh, Germany is so much sunnier now. Baby, go to that van parked over there. You got prettier. Wait here. I want to sleep next to him. Dad has cute dimples. Really ? - Yes. - Give me a kiss. Faten. Mohammad. - Ahmad. - I want to sit next to you. Don't worry, I'm going to be sitting with you for the rest of your life. Here, Madame. I'm going to sit in the back seat with my family, ok ? This is a selfie and everybody look. Do the victory sign. The "V" sign. One more. Everyone look here. You're the best. Welcome, welcome. So do you like the city, Ahmad ? See these two ? They teach German to foreigners. - This is my family. - Hello. - Yasmin. - Yasmin. - Tomas. - Tomas. Yasmin. - Faten, say hello. - Hello. Faten ? Hello, Faten. - Mohammad. - Hello, Mohammad. Hello, Mohammad. - How are you ? - Good. - And you are finally all together. - Yes. This is my family. Great. One. Two. Three. - Faten - Faten. Faten. It's only for one month. Just one month, then it will get better. Wake up, Mohammad. Do you see it ? Our house ? I will take you to the door, and then you will enter. But first, I got you presents. I'm going to give you presents, and then you'll go inside, Ok ? Here are the presents. - It's for you Faten. Open it. - Thanks, Daddy. You can open it. The biggest one is for Ahmad. The biggest for Ahmad ! Open it. I'll help you. It might be too big to open by yourself. Oh, Daddy. Why don't you sleep here in the camp ? I'm not allowed. But I'm going to come tomorrow morning to be with you. Ok, let's put everything in a bag. Put it in my bag. So you're going to go in now. I cannot go in with you. Because I can't stay here, Faten, Ok ? But I'll come and see you tomorrow morning. Ok, give me a kiss. Take care of yourself and your brothers. Give me a kiss. Give me a kiss. Take care of the children. Faten, take care of yourself and your brothers.
