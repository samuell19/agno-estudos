Lenfilm studio First Creative Union It's winter again. This story happened a long time ago. Some of it I remember myself, but mostly it was told by my father. And I'm starting to forget it. Only once in a while, when I'm writing or reading, or, like today, it doesn't feel like working all of a sudden I recall the sound of my own childish footsteps in a long corridor of our flat, and smell of cigarettes, "Blooming", that Lapshin used to smoke. Our life back then might seem poor to you now. Those days, the streets of our Unchansk, crooked and paved with wood, were pierced through with icy winds. That is true. And yet we were capable of anything, there was nothing we couldn't achieve. Everything was together, everyone was together, do you understand? There is this new arch in the park. And Lapshin, and father, and Okoshkin, now go to work not the straight way, but through the park, with that arch. A new steamer is launched - everyone is on the quay. Painting the peers? Again everyone goes, the whole class, the whole school, shame on those who didn't come to help. The piers are covered with flowers, the banners are stretched, we're under the banners. We lived far away, remote from big cities. And yet... This is my grandson. He's a good boy. The story I'm going to tell is a sad one. I won't skip the details. Memory obligingly pulls out faces, scraps of conversations, which are forgotten, lost. Let them stay. This is my confession of love to people, next to whom I spent my childhood. Five minutes' walk from here... ...and half a century ago. (a boy) Tra-la-la. Extension 7? That's me. I'm nine years old. Hello, extension 7? Could you please... Could you... Who? - Clava. Clava from weigh station. - Clava from weigh station. They ask, who is on the phone. Okoshkin, eat your damn pie, or I'll get really angry. Father. - Turn off the radio. - A Messerschmitt coming! Chief accountant Djatiev and inspector Tochilin are performing a sketch "An Italian fascist pilot in Abbyssynia or The Brown Plague". Such sketches were especially popular back in 1935 This is our hollow, shabby flat without curtains - Damn, what a talent! - Thank you. - Like real artists. Number nine, please. I saw a similiar sketch in Guryev... Operator! Send a car over to Lapshin's house. Only with music. I love aircraft so much, I can't help it. - Yep. (singing) What does their staff think? Their staff thinks this way. In 1606 Polish army reached Moscow. Only to flee together with their Vladislav. - For second time it was Napoleon who conquered Moscow... - I was treating an old woman once... Charming granny. Used to make her own strawberry soap all the time. Yours, she said, smells with cats! Had a fever for days, died yesterday. - 37.7 already. - Granny sends her regards. - Vasya, hey, Vasya! - Wha? - Hiya. - I have a toothache. ...to be only your friend... Say, have you ever been to Borjomi? What a beauty. The mountains, the air! - I thought he was fat... - Heh, fat... You must see it. What, is it really an all-union spa? - I'm non-partisian, Vanya. - Were you expelled or what? Why "expelled"? Nobody was expelled. I'm married to priest's daughter. She's a good woman. What should I do? I'm 40. And you're married to priest's daughter. - Where do you live? - Rylsk. See. Rylsk! That day, Chief Inspector of CID Ivan Lapshin turned 40. Patrykeevna baked him a pie with mushrooms, And my father and I, we bought a cigarette-case, with tennis rackets on cover. It was snowing. Everyone talked mostly about forthcoming war. Our strategy is not like theirs, that's where they make a mistake. They should have given it a second thought before attacking. Now that there's the Baltic zone. What does "zone" mean? I know what "Baltic" is, but what's "zone"?. Go ask your father, he will tell you. Exchange? Connect me to Clava from weigh station. What, do you need to weigh something, eh, Okoshkin? Who's on the phone? A store-keeper. Clava, where have you been? Okoshkin, shoot her and shoot yourself afterwards. - Let's go. - We have flowers, lights here.... - ...that's it.... - ...wasn't there... - No, really. Where were you? - I would... - ...took the suitcase... - ...four engines... - ...marvellous, you say? - You bet! - Thirty-one, thirty-two... - You should get married. - I know one fireman... - Go to hell. Come on, one more time, thirty... - Giving up... - Come on, why so soon? I like marches. Because they preserve our country's youth . For the last time, to the last battle... The car is outside. - Vanya! - Yeah? For the last time, to the last battle, the metal squadron flies... For the last time... to the last battle... ...the metal squadron flies. - Egorov the Champion... - Snow has fallen. Snow has fallen, and we're both 40 years old? So how's my beetroot salad? - It's pointless. - Goodbye. - There a bulb to the right. - Au revoir-reservoir-samovar. Want to visit me, Vanya? We'll go on the cart. I wish I had time, Hohryakov, my dear friend. Had a great time. And that Hohryakov... that's a toad, I tell you. - Yeah, everyone's a toad, except for us. - We're out of sugar. Alexander, it's bedtime. I said, we're out of sugar. It all went for the stewed fruit. There's no way it takes a kilo of sugar to make a stewed fruit I don't have that money! I'm not making it out of air, you know. Don't shout at me! I'll report you to comrade Kalinin. Go ahead, write. Alexander! That's not a man's behaviour. And I'll report that you ate your husband. That's right. Do you know what kind of file I have on you? I could send you off to Solovki. And while you're at it, what kind of name is that? Patrikeevna? Is that an alias? Go away! Away! Well, Ivan Mihailych! (Lapshin laughs) What's the matter, Ivan Mihalych? Nothing. Had a bad dream? About what? An airplane. What about that airplane? You were flying, did you? Yeah, write it down and go get a medicine. so I went down to the landing platform... very fast, very fast... And what's there on the platform, Vasiliy? (bravura march) Wait!.. Actors are fixed up very well, selling wood on black market. That troup is exceptionally good, superb acting. I went with a girl to one of their plays, I was so agitated, so excited, that I almost shivered - Buzz off! At the sight of Okoshkin the carter, of course, fled. That place was a market for stolen wood. That's how they called the alley near the square - Wooden. That's how it all started, from that stolen wood. You've dropped your purse. Thank you. He made off after seeing you.. The big bad Wolf laid back his ears and went... And did this! - That's a Little Red Cap for you. - Sweet candies. Vanya! Ivan Mihaylich! Can you come over here for a second? That's comrade Lapshin. Our local Pinkerton. A witness of many, so to say, dramatic events. Comrade Lapshin used to work in Leningrad Say, in summer on Volga I played with this cheater... I'm thirty years old, the crown waits for me. Excuse me, Ulia Konstantinovna, for saying your lines No, please, you're doing fine. Thank you. Excuse me, do you have any whores? - What? - Whores. It's just that we're rehearsing a new play, it's a very good play. Harsh, almost violent. Ulia Konstantinovna, she's a lead and I'm playing a small part. A whore. Well, actually, we don't detain prostitutes, only as accomplices... That will do! What? They're detained anyway... So last summer I played with that cheater on Volga, lost 600 rubles! Now, about these crimes in the town. What can you say about psychology of the killers? What psychology? Murderers. - A caravan! I told you! - Forward! Clew up! Raise the Black Roger! Hurray!!! Careful, the boys made it slippery. The "Daisi" perfume. My sister used it once. Drive off! And you call yourself a civilised carter! I'll take your license plate! Well, he is civilised all right. The horse isn't. ...and I don't know him as well... Look, a small one, but bites like a polecat! Move it! Move it! Move on, move on! Comrade Lapshin! They sent to me one dame, she came to your department once. And no papers! Only a pawn ticket for watch. What an ignorance! Chief, we've boiled a nice hot soup, how about it? When did she leave? About ten minutes. "Carrier's", that's how they announced that stop. "Carrier's stop". Right. - Good day. - Good day. I do have one character for you, her name is Kate-Napoleon A lively woman. Come with me, if you want to meet her. So, you think I'll do it? Of course you'll do it. Absolutely. Only explain to me what is it you want. I know that kind of people. Well, you see... Actually, I'd like to see her by myself. Well, let's go. Chief, can you give me a lift? Excuse me, the stocking is hanging out of your bag.. Comrade Osovec, why are you wearing jackboots? Tell your Chief that I reprimanded you Phew, wow. (boys) moving, moving! Lost a wheel! A hundred "Bloomings". - Stop torturing me. - It's myself I'm torturing. - And me. You better put that pie off, Katerina It's impolite to eat, while you're spoken to. In our country, if you don't work, you don't eat, heard that? You may leave now. - Yes, sir. I want you to meet an actress. She's acting in our theatre. And you will tell her the facts. But, I need to ask you to leave out all the filth. You know, the specifics, the details. Tell her how you're going to start a new life. When I get away, I'm going to live there with my parrot, and play the ukulele. Yeah, right. Well? Shall I call her? Why did you add two years? Bastards! Stinking bastards! For the robbery, Katerina. What robbery? Come on, a pair of shoes?! And what about the fabric? What robbery? Go take the accounts and check! - Don't be rude, I'm telling you! - Go ahead, count it! So? I'll call the actress? Here you are. How do you do. I'm Natasha. You know, it turhed out that, in some sense, you're the character I'm going to play. Yes, my character is a convict - Have a seat. - Thank you. - She's working at the canal. - Help yourself, Katerina. And in the process she's learning the hard way. I want to show it to you as I see it. Look Katya, these are my lines, and these are read by my partner... I traded my sealskin for cocaine... Nura, please, sew the buttons on my jumper I have two summers left to live and then I'll overdose myself with cocaine... Sings. "In the morning..." - Look, Chief! - Stop! Are you insane?! What are you doing! - You idiot! - Just kidding, Chief! - You want another term? - I'm only kidding. - What did I do? - What happened? - Nothing happened. - What kind of joke is that?! - Did something happen? - I was just kidding, Chief. Idiot. So. What does Capablanca do? Capablanca moves this way. Capablanca... blanca... bunker... banter... banter... tanker...!! I can make a different move. So that's where all the sugar goes. In kilograms. Unbelievable! Vasiliy. Tell me, Vasiliy, how come we have always been fetching the wood, and you somehow can never make it? - Huh? Wha? What?.. So that's it. - Yes. You'll make a dead man walk. - Here, I'm kind today. - Look who's talking! Jesus. - That's Patrykeevna, always putting her rubbers in the wrong place! - Tra-la-la!.. I'll burn it next time. Ivan Mihalych, you'll cut your feet. Capablanca, I advise you to be more careful. That's a very bad omen. And for everyone, by the way... (howling) You better cut it out, that superstitious talking! - Enough! - Where's my petrol can? Witnesses! Clear the way! Don't push from behind! Where's my can? - Well!.. - Don't "well" me! Polyakov! Are you deaf? Move it! Slouch! You're a slouch! I told you to plug it up! You're a slouch, you hear me? I did tell you! Look, he has spilt all the petrol! Go away, you're getting on my nerves. Slouch! Son of a bitch, damn you! Slouch! The train's leaving, last call. That winter Lapshin was after the notorious Solovyev gang, killers without purpose and mercy, as my father called them.. Lapshin had already nabbed Solovyev once three years ago. Only they tried him not here, but in Turkestan, for the murder of a local state worker, where they gave him a capital punishment, And where he escaped from those fools. Now Lapshin had to catch him for the second time. On the horses! That's alright. We'll nab him and implement the capital punishment by May Day. No point in dragging out the investigation. We're not of that kind... - Right? - Right. That's alright! We'll clean out the ground, then plant a garden and we'll still have time to walk in it! - Family name? - Spitsyn. Vasya, come on! And watch out, don't let drivers trick you. Got it? ? ???????, ???? ? ?????????? ??? ?????????. ????? Thank you, thank you, Ivan Vasilyevisch. Glory be to Hymen! - Prometheus, not Hymen. - Thank you, Ivan Vasilyevisch. Ivan Mihaylovich... ..to the director, quick. Prometheus is a god of fire. Distribute it strictly through the party cell. We don't have a single drop of wine, and the one that Ramon sent as a present from Spain... Hello, Chief. And for those who got wood from our superiors - nothing! Well, good luck to you, go warm yourselves. And send in an application tomorrow Thanks a lot. You devils, leaving like that! Why didn't you call me? Ivan Mihaylovich, you're very nice, very sweet, very good person. Chief, a salute in your honour! Hurray! What a fool. Scared everyone. Why are you looking at my arms? (Ivan Mihalych, why don't you come inside, warm yourself?) See, they're not beautiful at all. Could you give us a note for Usyagin? We're freezing here. Why not, come with us, have a beer. With burned sugar. Very, very tasty. Well, I might have a sip. - Let's go. - See, there is wood in town after all. It's all our negligence. He's completely blind, it will be a disaster. It's official, I tell you. I tell you! Let's have a talk Let's go. At the brink of an abyss!.. And in the raging ocean! Amidst ferocious waves and stormy darkness! - Have a seat. And in Arabian hurricane... And in the breath of plague! - Hey, Ivan Mihalych. What brings you here? - And you, still writing? - How about some meat dumplings? - Will do. I was at Aldan, looking for gold. Listen, Ivan Mihalych, chuck your goons Let's hit the road. I'll show you people you have never seen. And the trees, the towns... No time for that, brother. Working on something? Yes. A biography of one aviator. Take me with you, let's chase criminals together. No. What if you get knifed? Can you think of it, Vanya, how important the idea is. Smoking near the animals is forbidden. And the fox is carrying me into the woods... You see, Vanya, my wife died. Departed from this life. What are you saying! I arrived, and she'd already been buried for three days. Diphteria. Heart failure. Anyway, how're you doing? I'm fine. Greetings, comrades. Hello, Khanin. My deepest gratitude to you, comrade Lapshin. How's your cold, is it over? When did you come? - Today. - Today. And where is Lika? She died. Departed from this life, you see. Six days ago. What a farce. Heart failure from diphteria. By the way, me and Ivan are leaving for Aldan. - We want to get rich. - Stop it. My father was playing in a military orchestra. Fellow artists, new board games have arrived! It's called "Night Flight". - Want to play? - None of his business If everything in the world consists of tiniest atoms which move around, forming different combinations... Why are you so beautiful then and why do I love you so much? - Fool. - Ivan Mihalych, let me get your coat. - Did you write that? - Hundred years ago. - ...awaken the imagination... - I played Mary too once. Comrades, get ready for the third act. On a rehearsal I slipped and fell into the fountain. The head dismissed me, now I'm a potato at children plays. My line is "Earth me up, earth me up". Why are you looking at my hands? - I'll be a great Ninka. - You will. - Should be a great perfomance. - Thank you. ...march to the battle... (mumbling) - He's that much into a character. - Take him away already. - Is he an artist too? - An artist. - No, he's just our... tailor. - He used to work at circus. ...march to the battle!.. Regarding the specificity of your profession, have you ever had to kill a man? Well, I've been dealing with criminals for 17 years, so... ...For the assault, advance! The world must be won, Arise proletarians! Our brothers' blood Calls for justice... All's silence, grim and threatening. An eerie voice sounds twice. There rises Up through the haze a menacing Black figure.... Alright, I got it. Look, Okoshkin. Gorging on ice cream. Pull up, Vanya. - Nutcase! A nutcase, dammit. - He is Okoshkin, the name Vasiliy. ...it's always like that with him.... - Got it. - How's that? Okroshkin? - Okoshkin, you fool. I prefer red color and blue. And you're green. Vasya, why don't you look at me? And why should I do that, madam? I am not a madam. I'm your wife, Marusya. We have two children. Ah, a joke, I see. You're an artist, I remember. What's your family name? Okoshkina! My last name is Okoshkina. And I'm your wife Marusya. We have two children: David and Vanya. Vasya, come back to me. Come back, Vasya. They are crying. You know, how difficult it is for me! - They keep calling you: "Daddy, daddy!" - What exactly do you mean? - You're eating ice cream while they are crying. - You're insane. - Come back! - I'll call a policeman! My darling, a woman must have pride in herself - Poor thing. ...buzz off... Yes, our woman must have pride... - Well? Well? - Great! delightful Here you go, then.. I can do it! You see, I can do it! You can do everything, and Ivan can do everything. Lets go have some sleep. And so can I. Here. Natasha, wake up already. - Let's go. It's over. - Huh? What's over? It's all over, you funny man.. Good night, Chief! - At ease! - Hurray! You'll fit in if you tuck up your legs. Tuck up yourself. Patrykeevna, don't step on Khanin's head, it's soft. I won't. I'm not that stupid. - Give me something to eat, woman. - You gonna live with us? Here and there. Starting from today, I don't respect you as a person. And it's over with the radio. And I don't care. Okaay. Right. No, here. I scared you. I scared you! Give him a hot soup, granny. Ooh, my head. Did someone fire gun? Noone fired! A sideboard fell over! Move it! Let's go to sleep. Tomorrow you'll come with me. To chase criminals. - Go away. - She's dead. What can you do about it? He's had too many. Can't stay straight. Never chain the door, I'm telling you! Hey, Nosey is here! You're the only one here! Not the only one! How dare you come in here! In such shape! What? Why are you shouting? Why are you shouting at me? Stop it, you fool, don't ask for it. Why are you shouting at me! Tomorrow report to Dobuzhinskiy, that you're under arrest for 10 days! - Go on, push a falling man, finish me off! - Don't ask for it, you idiot. - I'll tell you what I think about you. - Don't ask for it. - That insane actress... - Let's go get you back in shape, come on. - And don't worry. - Like a living dead! She ruined it, she ruined it all, that crazy actress. - That's right. - It's awful. And he took her to the deparment! I wonder, what for? I'll send her to jail, Khanin, I'll do it. Yes. Okoshkina? Comrade Okoshkin has left on assignment. In Rylsk. - Now we're going to play the Papanians. - Yes, for 10 days. - I won't. - You will. Goodbye to you. - You will. - Let me go, you'll drown me, you bastard! - One more time? - Take off the scarf, you'll strangle me. That's how Khanin moved to Lapshin's place and the six of us started to live together. Look here, Kashin. See, my eyes are blue. Blue? Yours are blue as well. A bit whitish, in a sense. And the tatar - black? I'm asking you: the tatar's eyes, are they black? - Well...now... No, can't say. - What color were his eyes? - Tatarish. - Heh tatar has tatarish eyes. No, oriental. Oriental. Let me go, Chief. I'll hang myself in prison. You can't hang yourself. We forbid that. You've gone mad, Kashin. You should be shot, like a mad dog. Sorry. Absolutely must be shot. Why? What for, Chief? I'm innocent! Hush! Sit down, Kashin, no walking. I couldn't hit a man with a fist. Solovyev hit two times, and one - the tatar. Alright, Kashin, so - according to papers, on the 30th of october you were hired as a carter on a construction site. A watchman, actually. Well, shall we go on? At a slaughter-house too. I took the liver, the innards... I didn't eat it, though, I sold it on the market. - Excuse me. - That's where I met Solovyev. - See, what a circus we're having here. - I'll for you in the forensic med's office. We used to sweat our guts out in a slaughter-house at Oboyan' - This number? - If only I knew they're gonna kill that man Chief, I would never... See? But I didn't know! I really didn't! Well and then he says - Grisha you have the appearance, you offer the man, - forgot his last name - Kostelyanin. - Sorry. Yes. Offer him some meat. - The man. Always forget the name. - THis one? Yes, in this coat. He only had 9 rubles with him. And why? Why did he come in the first place? I took out the crate, so he could see the beef. The man rose, I'm watching... Don't know what to do And then I see that Solovyev comes from the corridor... and that he's smiling in a strange way. - And - he hit him in the head. - Just like that? I say: "The hell are you doing! I live here!" Then Tatar. He says, go fetch a basin. Well... a basin. So I brought and put it. Then another one, put it there too. Question. Solovyev hit him once? No, Solovyev - no. Twice. And one time - Tatar - Go on, put your fingers in there. - Kesha! Kesha!!! - Misha? - Heh, Misha. What? Yes, I took the clothes, I did. Or is it better if they threw it away? Why is there no blood on your clothes? It must have been gushing. I had an apron. I don't have other clothes. It's the only one. Eh, Kashin, Kashin, Kashin. I'm innocent, you understand? Innocent!!! - And he said, knew nothing. - I pointed them out to you!!! I named absolutely all of them!! I'm not guilty!!! I'm not... Come on, a great time for having fun. What? A usual murderer. That's how they call them in Russia: murderers. It's alright, we'll clean out the ground, then plant a garden and we'll still have time to walk in it! Right. You know, I'm an old man, Vanya... You know, cut out that talk. I'm asking you. It's a blow for me too. But I reject all the rumours surrounding Mayakovsky's suicide. By the way, listen, in '38 our country will produce... - Why aren't we drinking? - Four, four million... - ...bottles of the best Abrau-Dyurso. - Got a pencil? - Write it down, it's an information. - Wait! The best Abrau-Dyurso. And by the winter of '42 - 12 thousands... - Millions, I suppose. - Yes, millions. What's the difference? Thousand here million there, what a generous woman. You bastard! Pavel Nikolaich, I'm sorry, really... It's so awkward, I'm sorry... - Naden'ka Arkadyevna! Nadya... - Well-well, very interesting. Choke on that kettle, you crazy bastards. Ivan Mihalych, arrest them, so they stop annoying me. Interesting, what do we have here... It's an article in soup. "Reh-ap", Vanya, think hard, what could it be? Rehap... - Bastard. What a bastard - Re-hap... - Alright, enough. - That's "We're happy!" - Don't eat it then! - No, I'll finish reading! The meat was in the paper, I didn't wash the meat properly, let me take it. No, why. I'll finish reading, and then we'll learn it by heart. - What a clown! - ...happy. Looks like "we all are happy"... And we are really happy, aren't we? I'm an actress, I don't have to be good at it, an opening night is in 3 days. - What? - An outstanding meal! - Yeah. Khanin's Punch.. - We have newspaper soup and matchstick punch! - All set! All set! She's waiting in vain.. Wrong songs, Natasha! Quit the machines Go out, proletarians March and march Form up for the attack. Flags arrayed And weapons loaded, For the assault, advance! Arise proletarians! For the assault, advance! Arise proletarians! Our brothers' blood Calls for justice. Nothing can stop The wrath of the masses. Drop! Hey, Drop! Stop saying nonsense... Return it at premiere, you bastard. Wait! You're quick! Let's better have tea at my place. That's something. A magic trick. Thank God! He's alright. That'll be all. Thank you. Go to bed. Dammit. There were only two shells. One was mine the other blew up the warehouse. I'm in bad shape, in a really bad shape. The guys laid me on the grass... You know. green grass. And they say, there was one shell... It hit you in the forehead, bounced off and blew up the warehouse. And then... I don't remember feeling bad. But I remember the grass. No, really, we faced death every day but it all was alright, eh? Beh, meh. You need a spa treatment. And days were somehow longer... Why don't you make us a fish pie, Patrykeevna. Go to sleep, sleepless. During Civil war Lapshin was a squadron commander. There he was shellshocked, but never got any treatment. So now once or twice a year he had these severe attacks which always left him awfully embarassed. Sanya! Sanya! What are you going to say? Half of the department went to see the new play. It was a failure. Moreover, the wheel of the cart came off on the stage. while Natasha was in it Let go! Let go! Next time tell me where you want to be buried. I'll hit you myself. Why am I standing here? Am I Sten'ka Razin or something? Alesha, see how it turned out? - And what if... - Comrades! I'll organise a commune from ex-thieves! For drinking - expulsion and shame! Got it? I'll take the wheelbarrow myself! I want you to remember this: my last name is Dorohov! Nicknames are cancelled! My name is Konstantin Konstantinovich! Ha. Ha. Ha. Why does it sound so fishy? You, pickpocket from Kiev, take that back! - And what if I don't? - What if you don't?.. - Boycott. - Ha! A boycott. - Boycott? - Boycott. We'll meet again, Kostya-the-captain! - Look here. - Ain't it cute? Her predator's instinct suddenly woke up. Apparently it did not clear off completely, but we'll continue the experiment very soon. - Gobbled it up. - Yes? ...Marusya's father was... Alright. Look here's our main expert in artists. - Hello. - Is it true, Ivan Mihalych? - The biggest expert. - One borjomi. - Are you nervous? - Terribly. - He is. Well, we need plays like these. This is my opinion. - Chief, we saw you in the box. - We think that the play was fine. And Egorov's character was vivid. The prostitute was not so convincing, though. Wasted our time on her, right? You better have some soda. Their fox ate the rooster, they forgot to feed her, and - goodbye to friendship. - They forgot how to make cream these days. I think that artist has a right to fall, like any other citizen. - ...not so lucky today... - Well, Ivan Mihalych, I'm moving out. That's decided. I'm marrying comrade Kucherova. - Clava. - I supposed so. - Congratulations. - Danke schoen. Natasha! Adashova! Comrade Adashova! Stop shouting! Sorry, she went home. Yes... Lyuda! Stepnova! Stepnova!!! Stay by the phone, if you're expecting a call. Sorry. Thank you. She had a headache, and director let her go. I have a migraine with all these calls. Amazing impoliteness. - Behind the window?.. But I... - ... no headlines at all... Give me the second backdrop. Natasha! Comrade Adashova! Ah, that's you... Ivan Mihalych... - Were you asleep? - Yes. I fixed your iron. You can use it now. Thank you. Thank you very much. So how about it? A cup of tea? What, now? You'll wake up Pavel Nikolaich. We have strict rules here. Well, I'll try not to wake him up. Fed'ka! You bastard! I'll tell your mother. - Thank you, brother. - Don't, Ivan Mihalych, don't.. - Here. - This house is 100 years old, it'll collapse. Fedya, you fool, hold the ladder. You're insane! Dear God... You're insane. That's just what I needed!.. - I took some borjomi to your dressing room. - Turn away. I'll change. A barrel. Yeah. The wheel on the cart was just as crooked. The director yelled until his face turned blue. And I left. He's right. Don't try to sit in a wrong barrel, I mean, cart. - That's nothing, I'll show him what... - Hush! Ah... Yes, yes. I'll send him to Africa. No, please. He's just nervous. That comes with the job. Is he the same with his supervisors? - A bruise. - Oh, really. I didn't notice. Washed my head. I said, is he that nervous with his supervisors? What supervisors? Vanya, my collar... You're... It's funny, the way you breathe... Vanya. I'm sorry, Vanya. I love Khanin. It would have been so good... Vanya. So good. I don't have anyone, Vanya. Everybody knew. Even Lika. It's like a typhus, Ivan Myhalych. I'll put the kettle on. Are you ashamed of me? Go to sleep, old man. And put your head under the pillow. - Are you ashamed of me? - Why, no. It's me who should ask for excuse. That's alright. That's alright. What a circus. With borjomi. - Get him this, get him that... - And my blue civilian jacket. - I know. - And my navas boots. Take your jacket. Hey! There was a metal box in my pocket! Are you insane, Patrykeevna? Search for yourself. Talking like that, don't expect my help. Things! You have... You need a truck to get all your things. You see, a bus... How was the premiere? - Pay me first. What? - You must have snatched it. You have nothing to snatch. Not very realistic, but we need plays like that. - Well, well... - Why so sad? Hungry? Are we invited to the wedding? After payday. By all means. Psychopath. - How's your about mother-in-law? Alright? - Mother-in-law? She's ok. Charming one. Holds my hand all the time. Charming are the scariest type. - Looking good. - Good? That way. Good! Good. Well, goodbye to you! And to you, Ivan Mihalych. All the best, Vasiliy. Au revoir, reservoir, samovar. Bye. Well, now the soda. Red german boxes on the kitchen. Good riddance, the sponger has left. Almost ate us out.

In March my father and I opened the windows. 738 01:07:08,250 --> 01:07:10,867 The paper came off with a dry crack, and it felt good stepping on it. I remember how Lapshin returned and telephone rang at the very same time. Bychkov, the journalist is under your complete responsibility. - Why can't I go with you, Vanya? - Because.

Attaboy! ..how did it get caught?.. ...the chain... What's going on there? - Surround the whole building at once. - Yes, sir. And a bullet was waiting for them, Nosey, behind every bush. Attaboy! Ivan Mihalych, how come I always need to go to the bathroom at such moments? Is it the nerves? The barracks here are 100 years old. Herdsmen sleep there. Herdsmen. In the old days they searched for gold.... And there was one german, who... Tuke was his name... Want some?.. A half. He had built a beautiful house. - Ivan Mihalych, what's that you're sucking? - None of your business. - ...good luck... - Make way for detectives! Put it away. - Hey comrade! - What's going on?

Under your responsibility, Dobuzhinsky!! What? What did you say? We're almost there! It's not over. It hasn't even begun. There'll be a battle under Poltava, Glorious battle, my friends. Civilians, clear out the area. It's dangerous here. - I'm from marketing department... - Come on, move it. - Madam, please. - ...think of it... Comrades, please clear the area. - Stand up. - Here's a good one, Chief. It's with holes. Tell Solovyev to be reasonable. Give me that. Tell Solovyev not to be a fool. Solovyev! Be reasonable!

Did they bring you my flowers? - To hell with your criminals. - It's criminal world! - And how about... - Look, Khanin, it's embarassing. - You'd better take the money. - Say thank you, blockhead. - Thank you. - Better feed my cat. - Thank you. Wonderful. - ...yes. Vera, my dear... Please, take those chairs. They're in good shape... Personal pie... - Thanks for the goods. Thank you very much. Three pills. Uh. An arsenic. My girl is ill. Kidneys. - ...That's all!.. - It's really awkward. Such a mess. I've got a call from Moscow. From your paper. Well, have a nice trip. Good luck to you. - The yeast was stale. - If we leave the chairs, then that's all. - Yes. That's all. - Didn't turn out well. Take it. Come with me, Ivan Mihalych. We'll go further and further. I'll show you such people. Such towns... - Natasha, tell him to come with us. - Come on... - Shall I go in the back? - Sit here. You know, don't forget to bind your stomach. If you break it, I'll kill In this town,there is an orchestra per one person. I've had a migraine for two days. It's unbearable. - It's blowing. - It is. Someone's suitcase from lower deck was blown away. Hello, comrades. I got an offer from a theatre, by the way. In Kharkov. I'll play Sancho Panza in Don Quixote. I'll put in a word for Natasha. - Beautiful. - Excuse me. - Why didn't you tell me? - What time is it? There's the clock, half past four. Why didn't tell me? Tell me - and that's it. And didn't get it at first. Staying in hospital has made you talkative. Sometimes I think you're made of stone. Forgive me. Don't hold it. My head is ready to burst. For two days. Do something. I've had a headache for two days. - If you want... - I don't need it. I don't need any medicine. Go to hell with your Kharkov, with your pills... - Stop it... - Go to hell, it hurts not because of you. Good God, go away already! You see, everyone's sick and tired of you here! And, by the way, I have a ticket too. I bought it on the 7th. Wait! You have cabin 17, mine is 22. And all my luggage is there. True. If it's Moscow, why not?! I'm not the Chekhov kind of woman. Khanin, dear, take me with you! Take me with you! I'll die here. Alright. It's a joke. It's called a joke. My umbrella is stuck. In circle, everyone. Right. Allo, Kineshma, port Kineshma! Congratulations on entering navigational... Congratulations!.. Don't be rude with your grandma! - ...tears gleamed... - Glittered. Who cares. People wrote the lyrics. And what about Kat'ka? Napoleon? - She's in a labour camp. - A camp? Good. - A troupe from Leningrad is coming to visit. - Yeah. They're not us. All the tickets are already sold out. You're a happy man, Ivan Mihalych. ...nice to see you... I have Khanin, Khanin has Lika. And you seem alright. - That's true. - Right. Will you come to see me? Some day, Thank you. It's like I'm not me. - ...white... - Someone lost a shoe!.. Sit, Drop, sit. Here! Named her Drop, and she's so huge and stupid. Sit, Drop! The big man is here. Brought some wine. Hello, Ivan Mihalych. How do you do? Stop jumping. Can't see you. Ivan Mihalych, I have a favour to ask. Let me live here again. - Please. - Why? Two harpies are drinking my blood. Slashing me. Yes, I like tea with sugar, so what? I earn my own sugar! Actually, Vasya, you do eat a lot of sugar. Kill me then! They send me to buy a herring. With three rubles, they want me to buy a herring. Fuck them and their herring! Serves you right. They'll teach you how to behave.. Take it off. - Work is what matters. - Well, Capablanca! White! It's a good sign. It was just a bad year. - I'm leaving for retraining. - Retraining... Training, raining... Castling... I'm castling. Our city expands further, across Uncha. It's already building houses in steppe. Filling up the ravines. Demolishing, building. Covering with asphalt. Neigbour is complaining: at the rush hour it's hard to cross a streer. Hundreds of people and cars. And more and more trams. A new number every year. There used to be only the 1st and the 2nd. Yes... The end.
