What are you, crazy? Get out of the way. Since you're new in town, we're going to make this very simple. Stop now. Yeah, man. The locals don't like it when you blow up their stuff. Put your hands in the air and... Hands in the air, dude. Not your whole body. Tourists. Titans, go. Anybody got a clue what this genius is after? Who cares what he wants? What he's getting is a helping of grade-A butt-whoop. All right, team, let's see what he's made of. Okay. Am I the only one who's sick of these "explode-y" things? Does this look like a taxi to you? No. It's way too flat and circular. I know you're not throwing that in my car. How did he do that? Oh, man. Uh, excuse me, but I did not wish to do this when you were not looking. Hah! You okay? I am now. Then hang on. But he went... Down a dead end. Starfire, fly. - Think we scared him off? - No. He's headed straight for... Titans Tower. You're gonna lose a lot more than an arm this time. Woah. Azarath, Metrion, Zinthos. Our house. Look what he did to our house. Dude, I need a vacation. Who are you? What do you want? Um, either that wasn't English, or I think I have a concussion. What a mess. Aw, I really need a vacation. I can rebuild my car. I can repair my tower. But my sofa? I can't even look. Here, here, Cyborg. - Huh? - Huh? Well, this place isn't gonna clean itself. Dude, seriously... when was the last time we took a vacation? Never. We're heroes, Beast Boy. We don't take vacations. Basic systems are back online. If anybody needs me, you know where to look. Translation computer on. You must let me go. I am Saico-Tek. You are not to stop me. Only he may stop me. I belong in Tokyo. Then why are you here? You attacked my home, endangered my friends. And if you wanna see tomorrow, you're going to tell me why. I was sent. My mission. He made me do it. This tower, no choice. Who sent you? No! No! I am not supposed to speak. You are not supposed to catch me. He is worse than any criminal. Angry. Cruel. He will erase me. Who sent you to attack our tower? Brushogun. This doesn't make any sense. People don't just disappear. I don't know what to tell you, man. The crime scanner's one of the only things we got working in this place, and it can't find him anywhere. I can't make psychic contact either. Perhaps this Saico-Tek possesses the power of teleportation? If he could teleport, he would have done it the moment he was caught. Oh. Oh! Maybe he just wasn't waterproof. I know. Not helping. So if the dude vanished into thin air, how are we supposed to find him? By tracking down his boss. This Brushogun ordered an attack on our headquarters. He nearly destroyed our home. He will be brought to justice. Pack your things. We're heading for Tokyo. Sweet. We're going on vacation. Tokyo. We made it. Told you it was a left at Hawaii. Oh! The city lights are like a million tiny phenorbla flies. It may look nice, but there's something rotten down there. And we're going to... Woo, yeah! Hello, Japan. So when do we get to go see the Great Wall? Never. It's in China. Ooh. But you know what is in Tokyo? The world famous, number one greatest, most awesome Japanese comic book company, Wakamono Shukan. Hoo! Oh! We gotta take the tour. Now. Please? Oh, we can't come here on vacation and not... We are not on vacation. We're heroes, not tourists. Our mission is to locate Brushogun and bring him to justice. And since we're guests in this country, we need to be on our best behavior. So let's just do our job and try to stay out of trouble. Come on. How much trouble could we possibly get in? So... the Teen Titans have come to Tokyo. Saico-Tek must have talked. Most unfortunate. Don't you agree, my friend? But you needn't worry. I will soon give these heroes a good reason to leave. "Toky-whoa." So, where to now? The roughest part of town is in the Shinjuku District. We'll start our search there. Okay. Which way is that? I don't know. I can't read the signs. No problem. We'll just ask for directions. Um, hi. How do we get to Shinjuku? Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Okay. Thanks. I have no idea what he said. Perhaps I may be of assistance. Mmm... It is this way. Um, Starfire? Why did you just... kiss that guy? Oh. The people of my planet are able to learn any language instantaneously through lip contact. So you speak Japanese now? Mm-hmm. That's great. Yeah. Great. What are they saying? "Run. The monster is attacking the power lines." Titans, go! Same power as Saico-Tek. Because it works for Brushogun, too. Where's a gas guzzler when you need one? I hear baseball's big in Japan. Well, get ready for a grand slam. Hey! Over here! Your mother was a salamander! Ugh! How am I supposed to pick up hot Japanese girls with a big green stain on my shirt? Your skin is green. You have fangs. And your ears are pointed. You're really worried about the shirt? Hey! Chicks dig the ears. Hey, wait. Gah! Troopers, charge! We have got to get one of those. Ah. You are the Teen Titans, hmm? Welcome to Japan. I am Commander Uehara Daizo of the Tokyo Troopers. Tokyo is a unique city, my young friends, with its own unique dangers. Of course, I am sorry you had to learn this the hard way. We're used to danger. But we appreciate your help, commander. Commander? No, no, no, no. You may call me Daizo, hm? We are friends. I will honor you with a tour of our headquarters and our home. I founded the Tokyo Troopers to help keep the city safe. We're not too different from you Titans, except, hm-hm, we are all grownups. My operation is a triumph of Japanese culture, technology and design. Living units are efficient but comfortable. Hourly training sessions keep my troopers in peak form. My highly advanced command center has reduced crime in Tokyo by 200 percent. Not bad, hmm? Hmm? Whoa. Extraordinary. Don't touch anything. With your permission, Daizo, I'd like to use this equipment to complete our mission. Ah. Certainly, my young friend. And what, may I inquire, is your mission? We're tracking a criminal who calls himself Brushogun. Forgive me. But you are ignorant of our culture. Brushogun is an urban legend, a myth. I'm afraid you've come a long way for nothing. As you can see, my troopers have Tokyo's real criminals well under control. But Saico-Tek said... I'm sorry. I don't know who that is. Uh, someone is playing a trick on you perhaps, hmm? I... I'm not sure. Commander Uehara. Tokyo thanks you. You've saved our city once again. It is my honor to serve, Mr. Mayor. Come, commander. The people want their hero. And I want to give you another medal. Enjoy your visit. But remember: Here, you are just tourists. Leave the law enforcement to us. Hmm? So... this was a fairly impressive waste of time. I don't understand. How could this whole thing be a wild-goose chase? I feel like an idiot. No, please. Do not blame Robin for the wild chasing of the goose. I can't even find my way around in this town, much less catch a criminal. Ooh! Dudes, I got it. I totally know where we need to go. Ta-da! Wakamono Shukan? The comic book place? I thought you were leading us to a clue about Brushogun. Hello? Daizo said he's not real, remember? But as long as we're here, we gotta take the tour. Ugh! The sign says "closed." Aah! No fair! Come on. Let's just go home. Are you out of your spiky-head little mind? We are in Tokyo, man. We gotta look around, see the town. Yeah. After all, that's what vacations are for. Whatever. They are no longer looking for me. But I will be watching their every move. Ah! There it is. The only Japanese I need to know: "All you can eat." This was the only place in Japan I wanted to see. It's like paradise for comic book geeks. Did I just call myself a geek? Otaku. Otaku? I think that means I'm cute. I know English, German, Latin, Romanian, ancient Sumerian and Sanskrit. Do you have anything I can read? "Super Twinkle Donkey Gum." Brushogun's a myth. So why do I feel like he's still out there somewhere? Uh, Robin... about that boy and the lip contact? Yeah. Is that why you kissed me when we first met? To learn English? On Tamaran, this signifies merely the transfer of knowledge. But on your world, it means... more. Or so I've heard. Oh. More. Ha. Right. L-I mean, yes. Lip contact is... I... I've heard that too. Hi. Greetings. Starfire? Yes, Robin? You know you're my... best friend, right? And you are mine. I never want anything to get in the way of that. Nothing ever could. I know. Then... we have nothing to fear. Fear. Saico-Tek was afraid of someone. Terrified. And whoever they are, they're here in Tokyo. Everyone may think Brushogun is a myth. But to Saico-Tek, he was real. But even if he is real, the Commander Daizo and his troopers can surely handle... Well, if they can handle it, then what are we doing here? I believed us to be having the fun. There's nothing fun about looking like a bunch of stupid kids. We're heroes, Starfire. We don't take vacations. We don't make mistakes. And we don't have time for... For what? For this. Must we always be heroes? Are we capable of nothing else? Can we not, for a few moments, be something more? There is nothing more. A hero is what I am. And if you don't like it... Robin? I like it more than you'll ever know. Thirty million people, 100,000 stores, and in this entire city, the only thing to read is gum. Hello? Anybody here? This is probably a bad idea. You... You... You go now. You eat too much, you. You will put me out of business. But the sign says, "All you can eat." And I can eat more. You can eat more? Can you eat... octopus? Yes, I can. Blech. Hey. Wait up. I'm otaku, remember? Where did she go? - Huh? - Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Karaoke? Wait. Uh, the lyrics are in Japanese. ♪♪ I will obey The traffic rules ♪♪ Teen Titans ♪♪ ♪♪ I will eat everything Without likes or dislikes ♪♪ ♪♪ Teen Titans ♪♪ ♪♪ Earthquakes, lightning Fire, dad ♪♪ - ♪♪ Grammar, math, science Social Studies ♪♪ - ♪♪ There is nothing I am afraid of ♪♪ ♪♪ Teen Titans, go ♪♪ ♪♪ Holler my name ♪♪ ♪♪ Teen Titans ♪♪ ♪♪ Half your troubles Will be gone ♪♪ ♪♪ Teen Titans ♪♪ ♪♪ Father Schedule control, uh ♪♪ ♪♪ Mama's weight control ♪♪ ♪♪ Wishes are ended ♪♪ ♪♪ Teen Titans, go ♪♪ ♪♪ One, two, three, four, five Teen Titans ♪♪ Good night, Tokyo! I love this town. As I suspected. The child continues to investigate. Yes. He is persistent. But Saico-Tek will take him off the case. Permanently. It's not much, but it's the only clue I've got. No screws, no seams. What's this thing made of? Ah! Nice. Saico-Tek. I want answers. Real ones. What are you? I am sorry, my young friend, but you leave me no choice. I must place you under arrest. They just don't make heroes like they used to. Hmm, my friend? Please. I didn't mean to. He had a power. He could regenerate. And this. It isn't blood. He wasn't human. Neither are most of your friends. Whatever this Saico-Tek was, he was alive. And now... I couldn't have. I would never... This isn't happening. This can't be real. It has to be some sort of sick joke or a setup. Oh. Really? And who precisely do you think would wish to frame you? Brushogun. Brushogun does not exist. Tokyo does not tolerate vigilantes. And you, my friend, are in very deep trouble. Ah. Welcome to my shop, young lady. Uh, looking for something in particular? I'm trying to find a book about Brushogun. But there's nothing in fiction or mythology. Well, of course not, my dear. Although few people today believe it, Brushogun was no myth. Um, heh. Okay, ladies. Uh, you're all great, and I want your phone numbers. But there's this girl I was looking for, and it's getting kind of hard to breathe in here, so... Raw eggs? Devilfish? Pickled sea cucumbers? Cow eyes. Old shoe full of wasabi? What's for dessert? Who's chasing you? - Girls! - Chefs! Are you sad about something? No, thank you, please. I am sad about nothing. And I do not have the boy troubles. - Okay. - Oh. I am not even certain that I have a boy with whom to have the troubles. Since the day I met him, I have had... the feelings. I have waited most patiently and had hoped that someday... Perhaps I was foolish to hope. Perhaps we are just heroes and nothing more. But no, we are more. I feel this. And he does also, even if he fears to admit it. And I shall not let him go without a fight. Oh, I thank you for this talk. You are most insightful. I must go find... Robin? - -Was apprehended at the scene by the Tokyo Troopers. His associates, the Teen Titans, are ordered to turn themselves in or leave Tokyo at once. Titans, emergency! Cyborg, Raven, Beast Boy, please. Starfire, what's wrong? Robin has been... arrested for a terrible crime. Girl, are you crazy? Robin would never commit a... Whoa. And he was telling us to stay out of trouble. Do we know where he is? No. I have tried to reach him, but he does not respond. All right. I'm transmitting rendezvous coordinates. Let's regroup and figure this out. Hurry, please. We need to help Robin. But you shall never get the chance. Erase them. Konichiwa! Starfire. Raven. Hey. Dude! Hot girl. Don't go away. I just gotta help my friend. Then I'll be back to take you on the best date of your life. On second thought, uh, maybe we should just be friends. "Brushogun." Brushogun is real. And I have to find him. Troopers! There is a criminal on the loose in our city. Bring him in or bring him down. Think you can make a meal out of me? You don't have the guts! Or maybe you do have the guts. Yo, B. I could use a hand here! Yo, B. Come on. How can I think of a good comeback when I don't even know what you're saying? Azarath, Metrion, Zinthos. The book. Go away now, please. You are a mean little boy, and I have no time for your games. I must find... Sayonara! If everyone's looking for Robin, then I can't be Robin anymore. Give me your money. - Speak English? - Yes. Good. This is the worst dive in the worst part of town, so I'm guessing you know a little something about Tokyo's criminals. I'm looking for Brushogun. Ha. He's just a myth. Troopers don't like us talking about him, all right? They say it inspires more criminals. Inspire me. He was real and very bad... with s-strange powers. "Was"? Where is he now? Nobody knows. One day he just disappeared. That's when all the new criminals s-started showing up. Tokyo Troopers. And I doubt they're here for me. Give up, my friend. You cannot win. You are not the only one who has been pursued. We each were attacked and barely escaped with our lives. But we believe this place will be safe. - For the moment. - Thank you. I shall give you time to... Starfire? What's up? Man, are you ever glad to see us. - I am? - You're gonna be, once we tell you the news. We went back to the crime scene and found a sample of that ooze from Saico-Tek. I ran a full molecular analysis, and after a few thousand comparisons, I got a match. That wasn't blood on your uniform. - It was ink. - Ink? Yeah. Just like the stains on my armor... the streaks on Raven's cloak... and the lipstick from that girl who kicked BB's butt. She was a cat girl! So the criminals are all connected. Because they were all created by the same person. Brushogun, Tokyo's first super-villain. Once, he was an ordinary artist who dreamed of bringing his creations to life. He tried to make that dream come true using Japanese dark magic. His spell worked... but at a terrible price. The darkness stained him. His skin became paper. Ink flowed through his veins. He was transformed into... Brushogun. Drawings. That's what we've been fighting. Then I didn't actually hurt anyone. I couldn't hurt Saico-Tek, because Saico-Tek wasn't real. - They were ink. - All of them. Then Brushogun created him to frame me. All right, Titans, this is our mission. We're fugitives from the law. We've got a criminal on the loose who can make other criminals. And the only way we can clear our names is to hunt him down and bring him to justice. Yeah, um, great plan, but... there's this one teensy problem: Everybody in Tokyo is out to get us! Titans, go! Can't you sniff any faster, man? It's a matter of time before somebody jumps us again. Beast Boy... you can stop. I know where the trail leads. Brushogun's hideout is the comic book factory? Told you we should have taken the tour. No guards. This way. Freeze! Brushogun. He's not here. Uh, I am. Brushogun? So glad to finally meet you. You're not the one behind all this, are you? - You're just... - His slave. He trapped me in this thing. This cursed printing press that uses my powers against my will. The criminals I create serve him now. But you sent the car, didn't you? You set me free. And you sent Saico-Tek to our tower because... It was the only way I could call for help. I knew that if one of my creations attacked your home... it would give us a reason to come to Tokyo. A reason to find you. So you weren't the one who framed Robin. Saico-Tek was printed twice. I sent the first to you as a messenger. He sent the second to Robin as a trap. He who? If you're just the brush, who tells you what to paint? That would be... me. I must say... you Titans have proven formidable adversary. Once you are destroyed, perhaps I shall print copies of you to serve me. Show your face, coward. Who are you? There's only one person who stands to gain from creating criminals: The hero who catches them. Isn't that right, commander? Very good, my friend. But you haven't caught me. I've caught you. So, wait. If the good guy was really a bad guy, then that means... Oh, sweet! Ha, ha! We're the good guys again. And you're a fraud, Daizo. A fake. Brushogun was the only real criminal you ever caught, wasn't he? One was enough. You used his powers to lie. To make yourself look like a hero. And when I started searching for the truth, you made me look like a criminal. That's a nice little story, young man, but I doubt anyone will believe it once you're all behind bars. Troopers, charge! Titans, go! Ink. Titans, the Troopers. They aren't real. Which means we don't have to hold back! It also means there are plenty more where those came from. Hah! Running away? I guess they just don't make heroes like they used to. Give it up, my friend. You cannot win. I'd say I just did. You can knock me down all you like. Destroy me if you wish. It doesn't change a thing. When this is over, everyone out there will still think you're a criminal. And the people of Tokyo will still call me a hero. I know what it means to be a hero, commander. And, trust me, you are no hero. The power is mine! That's a lot of ink. Gonna be one heck of a stain when this is over. He may have Brushogun's magic, but I don't know how long he can control it. What must we do? Erase him. How do I stop him? How do I break the spell? Without me... he is nothing. You must remove me... from this machine. Huh? You saved me. Brushogun's spell. It's breaking. Starfire! Starfire. Are you okay? I am now. I think I was wrong before. You do? Maybe a hero isn't all that I am. Maybe I could be... Maybe we could be... Robin? Starfire? Stop talking. Well, it's about time. So I guess you're not a wanted man anymore. Mm. I wouldn't say that. One at a time, ladies. There's enough of B to go around. Booyah! All you can eat. Well, all right! Did you also make the new friends while exploring Tokyo? No. But I somehow wound up as a mascot for gum. For uncovering the truth, for pursuing justice and protecting our city from a treacherous evil, I present these medals to Tokyo's newest heroes: The Teen Titans. So... I guess we have to go back home now, huh? You know, Beast Boy, sometimes even heroes need a vacation. Okay, next time, we're going to Mexico.
