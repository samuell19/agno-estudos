Can't wait for you to get at this hair, though. If I go get the dye, will you please do it for me next week? I really missed you, girl. Yeah, and apparently these roots, too. What you been doing? -What she been doing? -Nothing, nothing. Yes, the roots missed you, too. Come on, Terry, hurry up! Hey-hey-hey-hey. You ain't getting nothing from the store if you keep acting like that. Inez, whatever happened to that scammer nigga you was fucking with? You ever hear from him? We missed you, yo. Terry. You don't hear me calling you? You don't remember me now? Just let me see your eyes, T, so I know you're not mad at me. He not gonna answer. I'm back across the street at the shelter.

All right, well, then buy your own fucking toy, then. What you like? Power Rangers. Tell me more about your foster mother. You like her? She probably gone anyway. When I was in foster care, stuff like this happened all the time. My sister used to look out for me. But she ran away. Where's she at now? I don't know. I can't find her. My family's gone, boo. You left me on the street corner? Who would tell you something like that? Why the fuck would they tell you some shit like that? Get that out your head. Hey, yo, what's up, ma? What you doing?

Quincy Jones has made his mark in music as a composer, conductor and arranger during a time when it was almost unheard of for a Black composer to do a Hollywood movie. The imagination's always been a comfort zone, safety zone really, because it's something that you run to and make it anything you want... This house look... Everything okay?

Pea, out! -Not in my kitchen! -Not in my kitchen! -Look at the D. Look at the D! Good job, Pea. -Shoot! -I'll... I'll take it. -Let me get another. -No. Pass it. Want to go again? What's wrong? Where was he before? How many times you gonna ask me that? Till I get an answer. He belongs with his mother. Nobody's even looking for him. Course they're not looking for him because they're looking for me. And every other nigga round here with a target on they back. Hey, how many times I been locked up for you, Lucky? I just got out, man! Trying to move on from all that shit. Do you remember what it felt like to grow up without a father? I just want us to be a family. That's all. That's not my fucking kid. I just wanted you. But you fucked-up in the head. Yeah, nuts for thinking you would fucking understand. I didn't sign up for this shit. "You are not a cow. You are not a boat or a plane or a snore." -"Snort." -"Snort." Stop. "You are not a boat." -"Or-or..." -"Or a plane -or a snort." -"Snort." "You are a... bird? And you are my mother." Yeah. "And you are my mother. And you are my mother. And you are..." I literally saw you look at her with my own eyes. Is it 'cause she lighter than me? -'Cause her hair's nicer? -You're too sensitive. Well, then just be sensitive to my sensitivity. Where'd you stay this whole time? Was posted up with Mike. -That bike not hot, is it? -No. One. All right, I need another can of broth. Come on, let me do that after the game. No. Can you go now? And why don't you take Terry with you? How you doing, Lucky? I'm good, 'Licia. How you doing, shorty? You should call me. Do me a favor. Walk on this side of me. It's for your protection. You always this quiet? Sometimes. And what you thinking about? Well, it sounds like a lot. How did you get that name Lucky? Made a few mistakes, that's all. That's a story for another time. -And I'm a mistake, too? -Who told you that? It's why you don't want me around. That's not true. You're a blessing. For your mom especially. Everything is just... ...just complicated. A'ight? Come on. How'd you get that one? Guy cut me with a knife. Why? He wanted something I took. You see this one right here? See it? On the East Side, everybody hide they box cutters right here. It hurt? Yeah, a little bit. Everything's changing. A couple of years from now, we're not gonna have to worry about this at all.

Say, "Family!" Family. I'm so happy for y'all. Let me see. What you want to hear? That one. If federal court lets new zoning laws take effect, starting today, 42nd Street will have to take on a different look or else. According to the mayor, the crackdown on low-level offenses is a quality-of-life issue. If you change, in fact, the true nature of the establishment, then you probably have a defense under the law. -Yo, yo, turn it up! -Today, at 11:00, the police officer said he sodomized Abner Louima in the presence of another officer, although he did not implicate any of the four -other officers... -On the streets here, there are serious questions about police practice and race. -Shit's fucked-up! -A young African immigrant died when four plainclothes cops shot him 19 times, firing 41 bullets... The shockwaves are still being felt in New York City tonight following the acquittals in the controversial trial. An officer is allowed to stop, question you. If he develops any more suspicions, he can frisk you. So, really, it should be described as stop-question-frisk. Yer. What up, T? Yer. How you been? I'm not starting freshman year without no pussy, B. Light skin, fatty, exotic, hair down to the ass, no medium to hot breath... Nigga, them shorties don't want you. No, nigga, that's standards. Don't fault me for caring about my heart. Go get that. Nah, nah. -I'm good. -"Nah." Keep not listening. I am listening! See how they respond to that nice shit, man? -What's good with that? -I just got my own style. Since when is "bum nigga" a style? Hey, hey. You, you. Now. Up against the wall, right now. Yeah, just put your hands where I can see 'em. -Don't make any sudden move. -Damn, bro. Thought you looked older. Daryl can be a little aloof sometimes. He daydreams a lot. But overall he's a very bright kid. I was surprised to see that you were his mother. Most of our students here aren't as articulate. Oh, is that so? To be honest, Mrs. Raymond, um... ...I don't think Daryl belongs here. Have you thought about applying to the specialized high schools? No. I'd like you to meet Ms. Tucker. Hi. She's a counselor at Tech, Science and Leadership. I also run an outreach program on the side to get more students like Daryl to take the test. Would you be open to that, Daryl? If they got girls. A lot of the kids go on to MIT, Harvard. It might take some getting used to. There wouldn't be as many minorities. Ma, you know the Laundromat shut down? Yeah, they sold the building. So, where we supposed to go? Go down to Ramirez. What's a couple of blocks? I don't like going over there. Well... We got stopped by the cops again. Um, were they looking for someone? I don't know. Did they take your name? No. I'm just calling it out so you know it ain't me. Girl, and then he talk about he want to move in. I'm like, "Are you paying half the rent?" -Hey, girl. How you doing? -Hey, girl, what's up? Hello. Girl, so, you know, like, I'm a woman. I shouldn't be paying rent if a man stay here. -You know what I'm saying? -What's going on over there? Girl, you know they bought the building. But anyway, girl, what you think I should do, though? You think I should, like, split the rent? Girl, I don't know. Right, 'cause I ain't doing that. -Ah! -Scared me half to death. -Here, let me get that. -Any-Anything else? Mom, I'm hungry. Well, then go to the store. With what money? I gave you money earlier this week, Terry. Come on. Look, I only got ten dollars to my name. I'm giving you five. Here. You thought any more about what she said? -Who said? -Your teacher. Why does everything good mean I got to go somewhere else? Well... You'll probably fit right in. As soft as you are, I'd rather that than you chasing after Pea. Speaking of him, I'm switching to the night shift so I can be here after school. Make sure you're not just running around. What's up with you and Luck? Excuse me? Y'all not talking or something? Stop trying to change the subject. Listen. I'm not saying you got to go. But at least think about it. I'll buy you a new pair of Jordans. In each portion, you will have approximately ten minutes per section... Ooh. What, you want me to pull up there with you or something? 'Cause you acting mad pussy right now. Anything else? Yeah, where can I call you? Simone, quit playing. A'ight, give me your name on AOL. "Unavailable222." Wow, so I can't even get to know you? Yeah, get her, T. Listen, there's nothing else I need to know about you or your little dirty-ass, smelly-ass friend. Stop acting like we ain't doing you a favor, Midnight. -Nappy-head-ass. -Next customer. Knew you wasn't getting that. I ain't trippin' on her. 'Cause I already tried four times. -Got to be a dyke! -Shut the hell up, Pea. That's why I want one of them Indian-looking girls. Shoot, they fire. Let me see. Let me see it. Oh, my... You got into Tech? I don't see the big deal. Thought all I had to do was prove that I can get in. I changed my mind. Well, I didn't! I ain't going! Boy, you know how hard I'm busting my ass to get you chances I never had? You make me feel like a damn fool. -Be a fool, then. -Boy! I need you to talk some sense into him. Please. Saying what, exactly? That he should go to a better school. He doesn't want to be controlled. Who gives a fuck about what he wants? What does he need? I don't know. Matter of fact, I do. It's you. Like how? You're too tough. Okay. What else? I'm listening. Maybe if you quiet down some... ...he would actually hear what you have to say. Okay. I don't even remember the last time I raised my voice. He'd do good at any school. You used to like when I got spicy. "Try and be quiet." "You should try and be quiet." Right? Quiet like when you went missing for weeks and I sat here and said nothing? And never mind who you was with. -See, there it go. -If I get any more quieter, I won't even have a fucking voice at all. You know, I'm not about to sit here and argue with you. That's real easy for you to say 'cause you get to be the saint, right?! You get to be the saint while I'm stuck here fighting these wars all by myself! -See how loud you're getting? -What... -Well, then fucking show up for me, Lucky. -Fuck this shit. Show up for me! I wonder what'd happen if I leave, too. You scared. Something's gonna happen. I can feel it. I can feel it. Did he tell you he got stopped by the cops again? A few times. Then let him use his other name. He doesn't have an I.D. That's not the fucking point, Lucky! Shit. I don't know, a'ight? Day's bound to come any-fucking-way. Take care of your moms, T! Where Luck going? And you-- I'm-a say this one time. You look at me when I'm fucking talking to you. It's either you go to that school or you find somewhere else to live. You hear me? ...where to push and where not to push. But I'm-a take but so much, and she gon' take but so much, so we compromise. It works out for you guys. So, you gonna get married or...? -Uh... -All right, all right, all right. --That-That's a whole nother show. I'm sorry. You had a comment. Yes? You say you do it for the attention. There are other ways of getting attention. Don't-- doesn't it cost you a lot of friendships and relationships, being a bitch? Well, it has cost me a lot of friendships and a lot of relationships, but I find in life that sometimes having a friend in yourself is better than having-- worrying about having people as your friends, 'cause no one's gonna look out for you but you, and I've learned that in life. I've looked out for people, you know, but... You seem to make some sense. I mean, I'm saying, I-I have friends now. They're bitchy like me, so we get along. We-- I'm serious. We understand each other. And, like, I'm-I'm generous... -They got a little dog pound. -Right. And I help, I help out some of my family members as well as they help me. But they also know where to push my buttons and where to go also, as Paul said. Okay, yes? I know I like to get what I want, but I think there are other ways to do that. That only makes people... Come shoot some hoops with me. I'm about to go to the store. Come here. You need some money? -Ma gave me some. -Here. Take it anyway. A man should always have some money in his pocket. So, um, where you been at? I needed some time to clear my head. Feels like it's been a lot longer than that this time. Y'all breaking up or something? Want to shoot? Your mother ever tell you how we met? No. She used to work at this coffee shop that closed down a few years ago. I used to get my hair cut right across the street. I'd go in, I'd order me a bagel or whatever, but I'm still not sure how I'm-a kick it to her. And ended up telling her the truth. That she was the most beautiful woman... ...that I ever seen. Were you nervous? I just felt like she should know. But something told me to go back, right? This is when I had my other bike. A few days later, I said, "Let me take you for a ride." We been rocking ever since. T... ...don't get caught up in none of this shit that you see around here. Have I ever? Took me too long to learn that. I don't want to see you fall into the same traps as me and your mother. I want you to make better choices than me. When it comes to her. When it comes to everything. I, uh... I got into the specialized high school. Oh, yeah? -So what you gon' do? -I don't know. What you think? It's not up to me, T. You getting older now. Time for you to start thinking for yourself. What? I love you. You hear me? Yeah. Check up. Oh, got it. Psst, psst. Ayo, ma! What are you doing here? I can't walk with my lady? How was work? Good. Good morning. Yo, you remember what it's like when we were coming up? I remember. You should be proud of yourself, Inez. We made it. You don't seem happy. Think Terry resents me? Teenagers hate everybody. But I do sense a little void in him. First couple years of his life, he ain't have nobody. Kid's still walking around here with a broken heart. Maybe it's time for y'all to have that conversation. Give him some of the answers that he been looking for. Yeah, I'll know when the time's right. Um... I was thinking, when Terry goes off to school, maybe I'll get to doing hair again. Maybe open up a shop. Can't wait. Thank you. Citizens, I am honored and humbled to serve as the 108th mayor of the City of New York. As Toni Morrison has said, "New York is the last true city." And it is the vitality of our neighborhoods that define us. In the next four years, I will devote myself to building a better New York-- safe, strong and ready to lead the world in the 21st century. Thank you. Thank you. I, Michael R. Bloomberg, mayor of the City of New York. Do solemnly swear. -Do solemnly swear. -That I will... So, um... so, which one you, uh... which one you want to hear? Let me hear that one. It's mad old, though. Old? The fuck is The Delfonics, B? Why don't you pass me that one right there. -Yeah, who? -Yeah. What does it say? The sample. Wasn't too old for the Fugees. Oh, come on. You don't even know your own taste. Yo, these shits is, like, mad random, though, like... Yo, you deadass a old head. Like, what are you talking about? Cassettes in here. What's going on? Come on. T. Hey, I want you to hang on to that. That way, you can take your time flipping through everything. So, which college you decided on? I don't know yet. You should be more excited. Nah. -I am. -A'ight. Well, go somewhere far. You know, my era... ...we ain't get those kind of shots. Yeah. Maybe. Go on and show off that legacy of Harlem. Hi. I'm Jerry. Uh, I'm your new landlord. The lady across the hall said that your husband has cancer. Really sorry to hear that. It's all right. So you own those buildings across the street, too? Yeah. Yeah. Everything working okay? Heat coming up? Hot water? All that? I actually just realized that, um, I got a few loose tiles around my shower area. Oh, yeah. Let's go look at it. Uh-oh. Something happen here? Yeah. We tried to fix it a few times, but it keeps falling off. -Oh, I can fix this for you. -Really? Yeah. This is no problem at all. Um... wow. Maybe some new cabinets, too, because these have to be at least 20 years old. -Have you met Javier? -Who? -Uh, the new super. -No. Okay, let me see when I can get my guys in here to take care of all of this, and then also your... also your tiles, okay? -Thank you. -Yeah.

Okay, yeah, just let me know the day. I can stay home from work or Terry could be here if it's after school. Well, we'd actually need you to, uh, to clear out of the apartment. 'Cause there's-there's just too much damage. I mean, everything's got to get lifted. Like how long? I-I mean, as long as it t-- you know, until it's done. A couple months. What are we supposed to do in the meantime? -Calm down. -Don't tell me to calm down. Like two adults, okay? There's no reason here to get loud. We have no bathroom, no shower, Jerry. We have no stove, Jerry. Is-- there's not, like, a family member or a friend you could stay with? Well, this building is too old. I come in and fix something, I got to come back a couple months later and do it again. You know, this way, we come in here, we replace everything all at once. There's got to be another option.

I'm not here for anybody trying to make me hate myself. So how'd you miss a year of school and still end up at Tech? You like it? It's okay. Okay? And? What else? What don't you like about it? I don't know. Just don't. There's nothing wrong with being smart, you know. We could use a few more engineers around here. I just don't care about none of that, though. Okay, so what you want to do? Uh, I mean, I like a lot of things, you know. Uh... Right now, I'm... I'm into music. You want to rap? Nah. Like... Like, uh... You-you ever seen The Wiz? Yeah. Yeah, like, stuff like that. Um, this Black dude, uh, Quincy Jones, he, uh, did the whole score for the movie, you know. Did some other movies, too. Like a composer. Yeah. Yeah. PS, I know who Quincy Jones is. You should be in some art school. You could go to Juilliard. I can help you figure out what it takes. No. Kids trying to get in there have been training for years. Well, where'd Quincy Jones go? He didn't go to school. I want to see you again. I should be honest with you. Um... I'm moving in a couple weeks. To my uncle's in Florida. This white guy was trying to help us save the house but took the deed or something. But we can keep in touch, though. I'm gonna miss Harlem. What's her name? I don't know what you talking 'bout. So who's the girl I saw you hanging out with? Just a girl, Ma. Well, is she your girlfriend? What... Come on. You know I like Spanish girls, Ma. Pardon me? What, she look too much like you for you to take seriously? You know what, little boy? I love you. I really do. But I'm starting not to like you anymore. Now, what's this all about? Showing up late, not handing in your work. Something's on your mind. I said I'm fine. What's going on with college? You make a decision yet? Daryl? -Not yet. -And why's that? You discuss it with your mother? Yeah. A little. You know this is a safe place. How have things been at home since your father got worse? They, uh... they don't think he's gonna come home. I'm sorry to hear that. I think the landlord's trying to push us out or something. Do you want to come work with me at CCA? I run the after-school program. Part-time, a few hours. How much it pay? Enough to help. You do good, we'll work on something better this summer. I don't need working papers from you since you're turning 18 soon. Just ask your mother for your birth certificate and Social, okay? Um... Thank you, Ms. Tucker. I'm happy to help. Yo, Ma? Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey. Okay, breathe. Okay, okay. Okay. Maybe you should try and eat some food. Yeah? -I'm not hungry. -Okay. Why do you love me? The same reason everybody does. That's not an answer. I want to know why. You should... You should probably stop talking and get some rest, okay? I never really knew where it came from. Or whether or not... ...whether or not I deserved it. Maybe that's why I never... ...I never fully gave it back. Now I wonder... ...I wonder if it's too late. Damaged people don't know how to love each other. That's all. T, sit down. I need to talk to you about a few things. Um... Before Lucky got sick, we wanted to have a conversation with you about... I don't want to talk to you about Lucky. It's not about him. Yo, I don't want to talk to you about anything! Yeah? Only thing I ever wanted more than a mother was a fucking father! Maybe... Maybe if you, if you weren't so hard on him, walking around here so miserable all the time, he'd still fucking be here. You don't mean that. ♪ Every now and then ♪ ♪ I'm so high ♪ ♪ Knowing there's a chance I'll see you ♪ ♪ Feel like I could fly ♪ ♪ 'Cause tonight I will be near you ♪ ♪ We'll be one ♪ ♪ We'll be alone... ♪ Yo, Ma. -Ma. -What?

Come on, come on. Sweetheart. You seen Javier? -Who? -The-the super. Oh, um, not since yesterday. Sorry. Daryl, we need to talk. Your paperwork was denied. What? The Social Security number you gave me isn't valid. I'm glad I caught it before somebody else did. I-I forgot. It-it expired. That's not how it works. So, then wh-- that mean, like, I don't get the job or... Well, before I can even look into any of that, we need to sort out how you ended up with phony papers. Did you really ask your mom? Sh-She don't, she don't have 'em. You're from here, right? -Wh-What you mean? -Born in the States. Uh, y-yeah. Nah, yeah, yeah. Well... this could mean a lot of hell for you. To get a job, to-to do anything. I mean, it's still probably, you know, like, with the city. Fr-From when I was in foster care. Hmm. Oh, I have a friend down in Social Services who can help. No, no, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool. It's-it's all good. It's all good. We just-- It's all good. Hey, Janice. Listen, I need a favor. I have a student here -whose paperwork is... -Hey, no, no. Hey, yo-yo, Ms. Tucker, come on! It's all, it's all good. Um... Uh, they don't, they don't know I'm-I'm with my mother. -You know? -And why is that? Who are you supposed to be with? Um... Have you told anyone else about this? -Nah. -Is Daryl your real name? If you lied on your college applications, it's a felony. It's Terry! It's-it's T-- it's Terry Wallace. How long ago did this happen? When-when I was little. I was a social worker for years. If the city didn't want to give you back, it's likely because something happened. Regardless of what, you are still a ward of the state. By law, I have to report this. Oh, do-do... do any of that even matter, though? Um, you know, I'm finna be 18 in a few weeks, you know, so... I can't keep this to myself. I have to speak with your mother. Can-can I talk to you? It'd be nicer if you could help. What happened? What does it look like, Terry? Called the super ten times since yesterday. It's about the job with Ms. Tucker. Sh-She, um, sh-she want my birth certificate and my Social. The real one. What do you mean, the real one? Um, the papers I found in your room, they-they didn't work. What do you mean, the papers you found in my room? You went through my stuff? Why wouldn't you ask me? I didn't know I had to! She want to come by tomorrow evening and talk to you. For what? Well, I-I mean, I don't know. What was I supposed to say? I don't know how the hell we gonna get ahold of those. Come with me outside. I... I need to smoke. Starting to smell in here. You wanted to leave me. No. No, Ma. Why would you say something like that? Forget it. What time your teacher coming tomorrow? Around 6:00 or something. I think. T, you should probably see if you can, um, stay with Pea and Miss Annie a little while, till they finish working on the apartment. Where you gonna go? I'll figure it out. I'll go to your school tomorrow and get everything straightened out with, um, Ms. What's-Her-Face. Yo, Ma? Yo, hey, Titi. What's up? Um... Yeah, you, um, you heard from my mother yet? Nah, y-- I been, um, I-I been trying to call her all morning. No, she, um... Yeah, just, um... Yeah, just give me a-a call back when-when you do. H-Hey, y-yeah. Yeah, Aunt Kim. H-Hold on. Let me, uh... hey, no, let me, uh, let me give you a call back. Hi, Terrance. Is your mother home? Um... Uh, n-no. She left for work already? Yeah, uh... I think so. Do you mind if we come in and talk for a bit? Uh... Y-Yeah. I mean, yeah, yeah, yeah. -Okay. -Thank you. -Uh, this is Anne. -Hey. And this is Officer Philips, Officer Russo. May we have a seat? How long ago did she leave? Yesterday evening. What was the last thing she said to you? Did she say anything out of the ordinary? Anything unusual? W-Well... not that I remember. Uh, everything seemed fine. Excuse me, sir, could you, could you, could y'all, you know, not go through all our stuff? Terrance, we really need your cooperation on this. Uh, she-she, like, gonna get in trouble or something? You know, 'cause, I mean, you know, why does it even matter? I mean, you know, I'm almost 18, you know, so... Um... Well, about that. It's difficult for me to say what I have to say right now. Inez... is not your biological mother. Uh... Like some joke or something? No, it's not. This is the woman who abducted you. Whatever story she told you was just a lie that she cooked up. I am so sorry you have to find out like this. Are you sure you don't know where she is? Any ideas at all? Give him some room, please. For now, we need to focus on what's best for Terry moving forward. What's best for me? He doesn't have any known relatives that we can trust. That's all right. We can place him at Sheltering Arms for the time being. It's a family services program. It's... I know what it is. Just for a couple of weeks, until we can navigate next steps. If that's all right with you. I don't know if your parents are still on the street, but we can work on that. Everything was such a mess back then. In my office, the only record you had on some kids was... ...just an index card. Hello? Terry, is that you? Yeah. Y-- Titi. I stopped by the group home, but nobody seems to know where you are. I'm-I'm at, I'm at a pay phone. I-I can't stay there. You want to meet me back here? I want you to come stay with me. -Yeah. -Okay. I think you should stop by the house first, pick up any last things you might want to take with you. Yeah. I'll see you soon, baby. Okay. Okay. Ma? Hey, Terry. What you, what you, what you doing? I left some things. Look, don't stand over there looking over me. I'm sure they already got to you, so feel free to run along. Can we, can we talk, though? Talk about what? You serious right now? Fine. You want to talk, let's talk. Fetch me my Newports. -You was just over there... -Over on the stand. What you want me to say? That I fucked up? Yeah, T, I fucked up. But life goes on. So what? Well, as long as it's your call, right? Who was the one who made the choice, standing in that hospital? Was it you or me? Thinking you was my fucking mother! Lower your fucking tone! You better watch how the fuck you talking to me. Did Lucky know? Yes, he knew. He didn't agree with it, but he knew. Why? Why you do it? I don't know why I did it, T. It was something small that turned into something else. And that's supposed to make it right or something? Who made you the chief of right or wrong? You don't think I have feelings, too?! After all those years I took care of you, who the fuck was there to take care of me?! I stood up for everybody else! What the fuck was it for?! Every chance you had, every chance you had, you turned your back on me! -That's not true. -Oh, please. Nobody else give a shit about Black women except for other Black women, and even that shit get messy. Who heard me when I was hurt? It wasn't you. And it damn sure wasn't Lucky. But you were my mother! Hmm? Now, how am I supposed to feel? I need to know what was real. I never left you on that corner. I was the one that found you. Little two-year-old running around outside the shelter. I waited outside on that block for hours with you. Waiting for anybody to show up. I saw so much of myself. I just... I just wanted to look out for you. I didn't want you getting chewed up like I was. I seen somebody who needed me. But... But maybe I'm the one who needed you. And, T, for that, I'm sorry. I'm-I'm sorry. I tried to change. But I don't, I don't want it. I don't want this. Not if... not if it's built on a lie. Not if being loved by you or anybody else means not loving myself. They not gonna let you get away with it. I ain't going to jail. I already know what the fuck they gonna say anyway. Already know. And guess what. I don't give a fuck. Because I still won. I won. Because I know you gonna grow up to be somebody. I wish I didn't know. I wish, I wish you could've did a better job of keeping that lie to yourself. I wish it could've continued so that we could've continued, and I... ...I wish I knew how to be better to you so you didn't feel like you had to leave me alone. 'Cause I'm scared. I'm scared that I won't have no home no more. And one day I'm gonna show up and it's gonna feel like we ain't never happened. Ma! Like this wasn't our living room? Our home? I miss my bed, Ma. The one that you made for me. Where's home for me now? This isn't goodbye. I promise. This isn't goodbye, T. I promise. I love you, Ma. I love you. I think you should go. Okay, miss. Where to?
