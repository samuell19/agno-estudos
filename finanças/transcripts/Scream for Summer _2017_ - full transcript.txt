- All right, bitches, listen up! School is officially over! Here's to endless parties on the lake and staying fucking blitzed all summer. Yeah! - And then getting the hell out of this shitty ass town and never looking back! Hi. - Hey, babe. - Hey. Hm, could you get me another beer, please? - Just take that. - No, I don't want that. Will you just get me another drink? A beer, anything? - All right, hold on. - Thank you. - Hey. - That was fucking epic. - Best party ever. - Seriously, Monica, how did you convince your dad to let you throw this party? - Convince? Tara, sweetie, dad's in Tripoli Falls the next few days with some therapist he thinks no one knows he's banging. - So he just like let you live alone? - Let me? It's 2017, Claire. I am obviously a respectable and responsible woman. Hey, don't touch my shit, asshole! I'm going upstairs. My makeup is starting to run. - We'll come with. - No, you both stay back and clean up that mess. - Okay. - And see his clumsy ass out of my house. Fucking Christ, Josh! Sorry, babe, I couldn't resist. - Shouldn't you be somewhere drinking with your jock friends instead of hiding out in my closet? - You're hilarious. Wow. And why haven't seen you in these before? - Because you're usually more concerned with what's under my clothes. - Speaking about that. - It's probably not a good time considering all the people we have downstairs. - Come on, just a quickie. - That's a good one. It's always a quickie with you. Wait. - What? - I need a beer first. - You're fucking kidding me? - A beer, from downstairs. - Right now? - Did I stutter? Fuck. - That's a good boy. - Woof. - Better be fucking worth it, babe. Monica? Holy shit. Holy fucking shit. - Hey Sam? - Hey. What's up? - What time are you planning on to get home tonight? - I'm only working a half day at the marina, why? - Mom said she needs you to pick up her meds. - Can't you or Evan do it? - Just do it, Sam, please? I already have way too much running around to do. And besides, Mom wellbeing isn't Evan's responsibility. It's ours. - Yeah, yeah. - Thank you. - Bye. Hey, Tess. Hey, girl. Where you be? - Oh, I'm just going into work. What about you? - Trying to convince myself to do something other than lay on my lazy ass. - Shut up. - Seriously, come get me. I'm bored. - Yeah. Yeah, just give me a few. Yeah, yeah just give me a few. Brody, what the fuck! Sam? Sam? - Hey! Fucking Brody almost ran me off the fucking road, Tess. Oh shit! Are you okay? - No, I'm fine. It's just I don't know what his problem is. Shit. - What? - Hey, I gotta call you back. Yeah, I'm sorry, Officer. I'm looking for my license, okay? Yeah, I think I know who you are, half-pint. Matt? Matt, it is you! - Hey you. - Oh my god. Matt, it's been like-- - Almost a year, yeah. - Where on Earth did you go? - I had some things I had to take care of. But I needed a break from this place for a bit. - Break? Wow, does my sister know you're back? - Danni? No, kind of like to keep it that way for a little bit, if you don't mind. - Yeah. - I'll get around to it, but I just need to take some time. - Yeah, I understand. - How is she doing? - Danielle? She's doing good, considering. You know, Matt, after you left, a lot of things happened. - Yeah, I heard about your boyfriend Sean. It was a boating accident? - Yeah, he was on the water late at night. I mean he did that all the time, but they said that he went over and probably hit his head on something. - That's awful, Sam, I'm so sorry. How you coping? - It was rough the first six or seven month, but I mean I'm doing all right. - How's your mom doing? Still Mom. That good, huh? - Yeah. - God I haven't seen your mom in ages. I'll have to stop by the house at some point. Unless that's not a good idea? - Matt, like I said, whenever you left a lot changed. Danielle, she's kind of seeing someone now. - Okay? - And he stays at the house. - Ah. - He's really sweet, though. Evan, Evan Connors? You know him? - Yeah, I know him. All right, I'm glad she's happy. She deserves it. You look like you're doing good. - Yeah, I'm working at the docks over the summer. So yeah. - That's great, great. Hey listen, I gotta go. Apparently some craziness happened out at the Prewitt house, so I need to get down there and see what's up. - Monica Prewitt? - Yeah. - What happened? - Dunno yet. Oh, yeah, no I'm sorry. You should go, I don't wanna keep you waiting. - All right, later. Take it slower next time. Just because you're like a sister to me doesn't mean I won't lock your scrawny ass up. - Yeah, yeah, all right. Be safe. - You bet. - Thanks for picking me up again. - Yeah, sorry I was late. I ran into Matt. - Oh yeah? Anything interesting to say? - He just told me he was sorry about Sean and asked me about Danielle. - Oh no, didn't Matt know about her? - So, Brody came over last night. - So I see. - Uh-oh, really? Oh, I totally thought I covered it up with concealer. I look so trashy. - You were saying about Brody? - Oh, right. After a little bump and grind, we started to talk. - About? - So, he brought up Tristan and his unhealthy obsession with you. - And? - And it had me thinking about you and Sean, okay? I know you loved my brother, we all did, but I think it's time that maybe you should start progressing forward a little bit, maybe realizing that there are others out there that wouldn't think it's the worst thing in the world to be with you. - Wow, thanks, Tess. You trying to pimp me out, now? - No, I'm not talking about Tristan, okay? There are others out there. - Thanks, Tess. - I'm just worried that you're gonna let some great things slip through your fingers. I'll be fine. It's just, I'm not ready for this part of my life to move forward yet, you know? - Well, when you are, I'll be right here to help and glide your right through it. - Time to go to work. - Do it proud! I will fucking kill you. Hello lovely ladies. - Tristan. - Well, since this weekend is going to be fucking retardedly packed at the drive-in, I hired young Tristan here to be my little bitch for the next couple days. You know, gotta get the lot clean for the masses. What are you guys doing today? - Working, sadly. - Oo, oo, oo, why don't you join the cohorts here and we'll paint this fucking lake red? - I think I'll pass. You guys go have fun, but hit me up later and we'll go get some grub. - Word. - I can't take you anywhere. No. - Tacos later? - Yeah. - Cool, it's a date. - To be honest with you, I don't really keep up with her. - Do you know her? Were you guys close? - Not at all. - What about this guy? Why the fuck's he so nervous? - He's not. - He's sick. - Yeah. - Yeah. - He has the flu. - I didn't ask you. - Was I stuttering? - What the fuck was up with that? - I don't know. - Hey guys. - That's crazy. - That cop just checked her out. - What was that about? - Holy shit kicks. That dude was asking if we knew anything about Monica Prewitt. Yeah, apparently she bit the dust last night. - What? - Yeah. - How? - This dude said that she was found last night during that huge party that she was throwing. Apparently someone killed her and no one saw him. What, that is insane! - Kind of wish we'd went to that party last night. Would have been epic as fuck. - Brody! - Relax. - Morbid much? - Eh. - I mean, I guess it's sad. Monica wasn't winning any good Sarmatian awards anytime soon. - Damn straight, bitch was terrible. I mean it's not much of a stretch to think that someone would off her. - She torture you in school, too? Oh my god. - Did she torture her? - Yeah. She was the one that tried to prevent me from joining the cheerleading squad. I believe her exact words were, "Maybe you'd have a better chance "at joining a special needs squad." Bitch was cold blooded. - No yeah, I can't even count on my hands how many times she's come up to me, asking me for some new pharmaceuticals. - Oh. - I guess it's what Matt was talking about this morning when he said something went down at Monica's. - Hmm, she probably just pissed off the wrong person. I mean shit, it could have been anybody. Even that fucking bimbo she keeps hanging around with. The usual suspects? - Nice. - Oh, where is that fucking food? Food! - All right, dudes. As much as I'd love to sit around and debate the unfortunate demise of our illustrious ex-Prom Queen, Zeke boy here is starving. So, hey driver, can we talk about this on the go? - Yes, viva la beanersville, please. - Oh my god, Brody. - See, and we always got there. - Oh my god, Tess. Take that little booger out of your nose. What? - Did you wash your hands? - Shh, no. - That's just disgusting. - That's a waste of water. - So who would hate Monica enough to do that anyway? Really? - Yeah. - Sweetness, Monica was the antichrist. Did she deserve to die? That's a matter of opinion. - Sophomore year she taped the word cunt on my shower locker in tampons. - If only you could have crushed her mentally or something, Maybe light her up all torch style, like in Carrie. Like this, see? - You know what? Maybe you should just take a break with that for a minute. - You know, she came to the docks all the time and she always brought attitude, but it was nothing more than all the other uppity Daddy's girls here, so. - Let's face it, she passed life expectancy way before she graduated high school. I mean she did pill poppers on a whole other level, and on top of being Queen Bitch, she had it coming. - Yeah, I guess. So does the officer have have any leads on who might have done it? - Yes, they do. They think it might be the butler with a silver dildo and they just punched the shit out of her with it. - So nothing concrete, from the sounds of it. - No, here's what I'm saying, whoever did it had a, I mean to pull it off like that at Monica's party, that right there is some Mission Impossible shit. - Which means they're still out there. - Oh, I wonder if they're taking requests. I have a list of people who I'd love to see disappear. I second that. - No, it'll be a one and done deal. Some kid is gonna get scared and butt hurt and confess to the murder. It's what happens, all the time. - Mm? - Yeah. - See you guys! - Well, here we are. - Thanks for the ride. - Yeah, anytime. - Well, see ya later. - Yeah. Hey, Sam? - Yeah? Nothing, just forget about it. - Okay, drive safe. - Yeah. - Josh? - Oh, Sammy. - Yeah. - Hey. Hey, do you wanna drink? - No, I'm fine. - You sure? - Come on, let's get you up. - Hey, amen to that. Thanks a lot. Here you go. Josh, you know you're not supposed to be out here when the docks are closed, right? - I don't give a fuck. - I heard about Monica. I'm really sorry. - Yeah. Fucking cops questioned me for like four goddamn hours. I kept telling 'em I have no idea what happened, but they just kept looking at me like I was the one who wasted her. - I won't tell anyone that I saw you out here as long as you promise to stay away from the edge, deal? Is there anything I can do for you? - You know, you're a really pretty thing. Has anybody ever told you that? - Get your hand off me, Josh. - What? I'm just holding it. What, is that a crime? You asked me if I needed anything. Maybe I need to be comforted. - Get your hand off me, Josh. - Why, come on. Come on. - Sorry, big guy. Oh you fucking bitch. Sammy? Sammy! Fuck. What in the hell is going on, man? Where the fuck am I? Who the hell are you? What the fuck is going on? And why am I tied? What the fuck? I'm gonna fucking kill you when I get out of here. I'm gonna fucking kill you, man. - Jesus Christ, Mom. - Did you get my medicine? - Yes, it's over there on the table. How do you feel? - I'm great. Don't I look great? I think I look great. - Mom, you look great. - Thank you, sweetie. Did you have fun at the dance tonight? - Yeah. - Did Sean take you in his truck? - No. - Well he is a good kid, Sam. You two are a good fit for each other. - Thanks, Mom. - Don't stay up too late tonight. And no candy. You always get such tummy troubles when you eat sweets late. - Mom, I won't. - Okay. Goodnight, sweetie. - Goodnight, Mom. - I love you so much. - You, too. - Hey, what's going on, kid? - Hey, Evan. How is she? - Ah, she's good. Just had a long day, but she'll live. Are you okay? - Found out one of my classmates was murdered last night. - I heard about that. Some, Monica? - I mean we weren't besties, I didn't know her that well. How'd you know? - Goddam, it's been all over the news. It's still pretty crazy, though. I'm here to talk if you need me. - No, I'm good. It's just a shock, you know? Speaking of shock, what's wrong with Mom? She was being all creepy in the kitchen just now. - Yeah, she's been a little, one of those weirder days. I'm sure she's just in a funk. - Well, I brought her prescription home. - Thanks. - I think I'm gonna crash. - Really it's like, what is it? It's like 11:30, don't you have a party to go to or? No, after what happened at Monica's party, I think I'm good. - Good point. Everything good? - Oh yeah, yeah. Everything's fine. Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Night, babe. - Sam, that's gross. Get a glass. - Hey, you didn't happen to go in my room last night, did you? - Why would I need to go into your room? - I don't know. That's why I ask. When I woke up earlier, mine and Sean's picture frame was busted, and it wasn't like that when I went to bed, so I just kinda figured someone came in and accidentally knocked it off. - Not me. I mean if I wanted to borrow some of your white trash pop music, then maybe. But until then, I don't see a reason to go in your room. I don't know, kiddo. I mean maybe Mom went in there for something. She's been kind of out of it lately. Yeah, maybe. I'll get it. - Okay. - Ha! Caught you. - Go get the door, brat. - Matt? Hey, everything okay? What are you doing here? - Yeah, not really. I think you and me need to talk. - Hey, Sam, who's at the, door? Matt? Hey, Dani. - What's going on? Sam? - Listen, I hate to bother you girls this early in the morning, but there's a situation down at the docks. - What type of situation? - We found a body at the landing platform at the docks. A Josh Kirby? What? - It's not so good. We pulled the footage from the parking lot cameras, it shows you being the last one around the area around the same time they think Josh may had died. - How, I mean why do you guys want to talk to me? Am I in trouble or something? - Is she in trouble, officer? - No, it's standard procedure, Dani. You know that. Sam, I just need you to come down to the station and answer a few questions, that's all. - Look, unless you intend to arrest her, I suggest you leave, and you don't come back until you have a signed warrant from a judge. - Danielle, look, it's okay. I'll go, okay? - Why am I the only one surprised to see him? You knew he was back and you didn't tell me. - I-- - Do whatever you want. Just don't call me to come get you. - Come on, Sam. - Let me go get changed. I'll be right back. - Here you go. - Thanks, Matt. Well, so let's start from the beginning, okay? - All right, well we had just gotten done eating and Tristan dropped me off at my car. - Tristan Palmer, right? - Yeah. And that's when I heard a noise over by the boats, and I knew since the docks close at 8:00 that there shouldn't be anyone out there, so I went and looked. - And that's when you saw Josh? - Yeah, he was drunk and seemed pretty torn up. I mean I was guessing it was because of Monica. - Sure, okay. What happened next? - Well he was on the ground, so I told him that he needed to leave and I helped him up. But that's when he started getting touchy-feely with me, so I pacified him. - Pacified? I kneed the shit out of his balls. - And what next? - I left. I swear to god, Matt, Josh was alive when I last saw him. - And there's nobody else that would have seen you? Maybe vouch for you? - No, not that I saw. Are you gonna tell me what's going on? What happened to Josh? What happened? - Don't know. At first glance, it seems as if Josh may have had a motive to kill Monica, felt guilty about it, decided to go with slicing the wrists, paints the guilty on his forehead, and cut his wrists. - At first glance? - Well first of all, there's burn marks, bruising around the throat, rope burn. Sheriff thinks he may have tried to hang himself, failed, and then went with cutting the wrists. - And number two? - Number two being it's a little difficult to cut both your wrists, then to write guilty on your forehead without a mirror while bleeding out. Just seems a little thin to me. - So you don't think it's a murder-suicide? - I think this is a little too clean. Now the Sheriff is okay with that explanation, but I'm not so easily convinced. You good? - Yeah, I just need a second. Hey, I'm sorry about Danielle this morning. - Nah, that's not your problem, kiddo. - She's pissed I didn't tell her you were in town earlier. She not gonna forgive me for this one. - Well listen, I know Dani can hold a grudge like no other, but you're family, Sam. You'll be all right. - Yeah but still, I mean, she hates me now. - You'll be fine. - Is there anything else you need? - That should be good. Thanks for coming down. - Yeah, no problem. - You need a ride home? - No, I'm gonna call someone. - Hey. - What? - You watch your ass out there, all right? Dude, Tristan,. - That's kind of rude, you stupid dick. - Yeah, that's fucking rude. Zeke, how is the scooby dooby coming along? - Chill out, all right? Just chill out, man. - I'm chill, Kim Jong-Crunk. - First of all, it's Kim Jong-Un, and second I'm Cambodian, you racist fuck. - That's like the same difference. - Oh, back sass. Well that's a new one. Tell us, what's wrong, honey? Did Sammy girl not give you any nook-nook last night? - Really? You fucking told him? - Sorry, man, it's like bro code. - Right. - Honestly, Tristan. Let's talk about this for a moment. You don't find it weird or odd or even in bad taste to go after a fallen comrade's girl? - This isn't like that. - It's not like that. All right, then what's it like, Tristan? - Why do you guys fucking care anyway? - We don't care. Don't think we care. We just love pestering the living shit outta you. Now Sam is hot and severely bangable, in that quirky, John Hughes way. But you've been pining over this girl, for years man. Like even when she was with Sean, you were still after her. If it wasn't for the entertainment value alone, we would have put a stop to it. - Blow me. - Seriously, Tris, look. What is it about Sam that turns you into such a dripping pair of panties. - You guys don't understand. - Oh, god, try us. - Sam's not like any other girl I've ever met. - You have met any other kind of girl. You've been in Geneva, Ohio this whole time. - Tess is from Geneva, dipshit. - Well that's a fair point. - Can I continue or what? Just something about Sam is just perfect. You know she's gorgeous, intelligent, funny. - Oh god, I'm sorry. Please continue with your gay ass ramblings. - Forget it. - Fine, look, you were just jonesing majorly over Sam and so, why haven't you made your move? - Just never had the right in moment. No seriously, by the time I got the balls to tell her, she was already with Sean. And then when Sean died, there hasn't been a good time. Any time? Okay, you guys have been friend since, I don't even know, birth? So it's obviously something way worse than that that's preventing you from having your in moment. - Like what? - We can start with the string hanging from your puss cushion. - Ha ha ha. Why don't you put something else in your mouth besides my dick. - Oh, shit. Fucking asshole. All right. Hello? - Zeke! Oh. - Will you shut up? Yeah, what is it? Really, wait, say that again? Holy shit. Yeah yeah, we'll be right over. You guys aren't gonna believe this. - What's up, dude? - So Sam is at the police station. They just found Josh Kirby's body on the docks. Shut the fuck up. - I always hated that dick anyway. - All right, you guys coming with me to pick her up? - Wait, what about all this weed? Do we not? - Zeke, really? Come on! - Ah, hold up. - Fucker. Were are my fucking shoes? - Thanks for coming to get me. - Yeah, no problem. - Tristan! - Yeah? - Did they like give her a cavity search? Did they give you a cavity search? - No, no Brody. - Do you want a cavity search? I'll go back in and get like a, baton or whatever the fuck they have. All right, let's go. Hey, Sheriff. Hey, you get anything out of Willis? - Nah, not really. The report is in there, claims that Kirby was alive and well last time she saw him, for lack of a better term. Uh-huh. Any issues when you picked her up? - Issues? - Yeah, Danielle? - Well, she wasn't entirely happy to see me, if that's what you're asking. Hmm, you good? - Yeah, I'm good. - Well they haven't seen you in an awfully long time, you know? And? - Listen, I get it. You had a lot of shit that you needed to clear up with the drinking and the black outs. But you went away. You took care of that and you got cleaned up, but now you're back. And I don't have to tell you, that girl was in here damn near every day asking questions. Questions I chose not to answer because it wasn't my place. - What do you wanna hear, Jack? What do you want me say? Hey, Dani, sorry I left for over a year because I wanted to spare you the embarrassment of being proposed to by the town's drunk deputy? - No, but you know it wasn't easy for either one of you. Hell, you up and left town without as much as a goodbye, only to come back to find that now she's with your old high school buddy. - Yeah I know, Sam told me. - I guess what I'm trying to figure out is, am I gonna find this Connors guy out handcuffed to a tree in the middle of no where with a size 12 boot shoved halfway up his ass? No, we're good. Evan's a good guy. I would be an idiot to think that Dani would wait around for me anyway. If he makes her happy, then I'm happy for her, you know? - All right, if that's the way you want it. But personally, if it were me, I would go have a talk with her, air things out. 'Cause you can bet your ass, I'm not covering for you again. I've got that karma or whatever the hell that hippie shit's called to worry about. - I'll take your advice under consideration. - Yeah, damn right you will. Now could you get back to work or something before the rest of the department thinks I'm favoring you. - All right, thanks Sheriff. Uh-huh. You just need to relax and clear some of this off your plate. - I just feel so guilty coming back here, you know? The last guy I talked to actually died here last night. How do I look past that? - I don't know, but like you said, Matt said that it could have been a murder-suicide thing, right? - That's what the Sheriff thinks. - Sounds pretty open and closed to me. - I don't know, though. Matt doesn't think it's that easy. - Well maybe he's wrong. I mean Josh and Monica were messed up in their own way, anyways. - Yeah, I guess. - What's up? - Sam is feeling a little off right now. - Oh, babe, you doing okay? - I wish everyone would quit asking me that. - All right, then let's just try to hang out and have a good time. There's nothing we can really do about Josh and Monica right now. - I know! I know, I just feel bad. The last thing Josh experienced was me crushing his junk. - Yeah, and not to sound too disrespectful, but from what you told us, he kinda deserved it. - Yeah. - He did. - It's sad that he died, though. But like Tess said, Josh offed Monica and couldn't take the guilt. - Yeah, maybe. - Hmm, there's something else. What's up? - Well, on top of being questioned by the police, Danielle is pissed at me because I didn't tell her Matt was back in town. - Oh my god. It is not your responsibility to update your sister about her ex's whereabouts. - I know, I mean, you should have saw her face this morning. - There she is. She was the last one to see Josh. Pretty coincidental that she saw him last and then he winded up being dead shortly after. - Hey Tara, why don't you work on your cottage cheese ass rather than what's going on with us, yeah? - Hey! - What'd you say? - I'd think over that next move very, very carefully before you become the poster child of Abercrombie Lives Matter, capisce? - Fucking faggots. - He thinks we're gay. Sam. - Hey, Sam, wait up! - Your turn. Wait, wait, wait. - What? - I gotta take a piss. - Seriously? - Really quick. I promise, one minute. I promise, babe. - Oh my god, just make it fast. - Okay, you got it. Thought you didn't wanna see me take a piss? You just couldn't wait any longer, could ya? Tara? What the fuck? - Hey guys, turn that down. What? Sam! - Hold on a second. - Sam, is everything all right? - Did you guys hear that? - Hear what? Danielle? - Hey, chica. - Hey, Tess. Can I ask you a favor? - Sure. - Can I stay with you tonight? Things between me and Danielle are still weird. Sure, I'll turn around and pick you up. - God, thank you, Tess. I'll be there shortly, okay? - Yeah, all right. - Matt? - Hey, Dani. What do you want? Here ya go. - I didn't need your help. - Listen, I'm sorry I didn't tell you I was back in town. - Why are you back? - The shit that needed to be resolved got taken care of. The Sheriff needed the help. My job was still available. - Yeah? Well let me assure you, just because that Andy Griffith wannabe Sheriff of ours wanted you back, doesn't mean the rest of us did. Don't! - Listen, I just wanted to say. I just wanted to say that I'm sorry. - Where did you go? I wake up one morning and you're gone! There's no note, no explanation. Not even a god damned coward text message. You just disappeared! I didn't know where you were. I didn't know if you were in trouble. I didn't know if you were hurt. Do you have any idea what I went through? - I know, and I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - I'm sorry? I'm sorry? Is that really all you have to say to me? You know what, Matt? I don't care that you're sorry. And even more so, I don't care that you're back, okay? I moved on; I'm with Evan now. You remember Evan, right? You should. He's someone else you left behind. Oh gee, Matt. Did I strike a nerve? Good. - I just wanted to say that I'm sorry and not to take it out on Sam. I told her not to say anything to you. So blame me and not her. - I do blame you! You know what? Don't ever get my family involved in your bullshit again. You know what, stay the hell away from Sammy and I all together, got it? - Listen, I'm really glad that you're happy with Evan. I truly am. - Fuck you, Matt. - So where's Jenna? She does know I'm here, right? - Oh yeah, she just showed up. She jumped in the shower. What are you watching? - I don't know, some random ass slasher flick. Chill Billies or some stupid shit. - Not thanks. Aren't you gonna miss this? - What's that? - This. When you go to college. - Tess, it doesn't matter how far away we go from each other. You know we're always gonna have these moments. Just, it's gonna take a lot of planning now, that's all. - Damn straight. - Besides, someone's gotta keep you and Brody in line. - Hmm, true. - What's up? - Oh nothing, just telling Sam here she better not go too far wherever she decides to go to college. - Hmm, pretty sure the one who is gonna be the most heartbroken is our little Tristan. Jesus, did you see how hard he snapped at Tara this afternoon? It's love, kid. - Oh great, this again. - I hate to admit it, but he does sort of cherish you in a creepy Tom Cruise kind of way. - Friends, okay. Once again, we are just friends and that is all there is, okay? You know as good of a guy Tristan is, I just don't-- - Hey guys? - Here we go! Hit it! - Can't let you in here. - What? I came to see my baby girl. - Oh and that required you bring the rest of the boy's club? - Well, I didn't wanna miss out on seeing my baby girl. - Tess! - Yeah! I'll be right there, Mom. All right, behave until I get back. - Always. - Okay. Mwah. So what are you guys into? - Actually, we were just talking about Brody having a get together soon. - Ha, fuck yes! Why don't we go that? - Party on the lake tomorrow night in memory of Monica and Josh. Free food, free booze, everyone's invited. At the marina tomorrow night, 10:00 o'clock, see you guys there, Tara. - What? - You guys are not gonna believe what I just got. - Oh no? - Oh, did you guys get that message from Tara, too? - Apparently. - Great. But why on Earth would she even invite us to one of her shindigs? I mean, if I'm not mistaken, she was being a royal bitch to us earlier today. - I think the better question is, why on Earth wouldn't we go? Okay, hear me out. You guys were just talking about a get together, or a shindig, or whatever the fuck? And here it is. - Yeah, you know, friends. Not some stuck up slut's orgy. - Well, I mean babe, Brody does have a point. - Thank you, Zeke. - No, but it's free booze, and free weed, annoying Tara a little. I mean we can just show up, get drunk, smoke all of her reefer, and then we bounce. - Attaboy. - I don't know about this one, guys. - Shut your blasphemous face. You don't get a vote. Your balls haven't dropped yet, Tristan. - You know what, fuck you. - Well, technically, you do have a point. - Guys, I'm just not exactly sure it's really our scene. - Our scene? - This is literally our scene. This is lakeshore, music, booze, weed, drunk hooligans all over the fucking place. This is our scene. - I mean, I guess it's okay, consider seeing certain douchebags get slammed and we're chunking all over the place, could have its high points. - That right there is four out of five. Be a do-be, not a nope-y. - There's six of us. Shh. The grownups are talking. Fine. We might not have a disastrous time after all. - And that is why I'm the peer pressure king. - Oh, that's nice. Well, I think it's time for you to go home. - I just got here. - I know, but Mom's rules, Mom's house. Came directly from her lips, that's why she called me downstairs. - Your mom has never liked me. - I know. - That's fine 'cause me and T-boy here, we have a shift tonight at the drive-in. - No, you have a shift. - We have a shift tonight at the drive-in. So I will see you later. Love ya! - Love ya. - You don't get a kiss, buddy. - Maybe next time. - There's your kiss. - Douchebag. Savages, I tell you. Hey. Hey. - You're smoking? God I haven't seen you smoke in-- - Over a year, yeah I know. I just kind of needed one. Just don't judge me, okay? - Not judging. I just, is something bothering you? - Just a lot on my mind. - Okay. This a lot wouldn't happen to have something to do with a certain ex that decided to show up out of nowhere after being gone for a year and a half? - I'm really the only one that was in the dark about this, aren't I? - Hey, I just found out. Okay, I was the one that drove by the store and saw you two talking. - Oh yeah? - Do you wanna talk about it? - I really don't. - Do I need to be worried? - What do you wanna hear, Evan, huh? What that I'm not gonna leave you just because Matt's back? Because I'm not. I'm not gonna do that to you. - No, I think I would rather hear that you don't still have feelings for the guy that basically left you without ever explaining why or where he was going. - Thanks. I went like a whole two seconds without thinking about it. - Oh fuck, I gave the guy the benefit of a doubt. Who was the one that sat here and held you while you thought the entire world was crumbling around you? Me, where was he? Sure as hell wasn't here. God you sit here and you act like this is water under the bridge and everything is gonna be hunky dory, and it's just not. - I spent three years of my life with Matt. Okay, I know him. Probably better than he knows himself. And it'd be a lie for me to stand here and say that I don't have any feelings for him. To deny it? No, I can't. Look, there's something there, but I don't know exactly what it is. But what I do know is that this is hard. And I would appreciate it if you could understand that. - How am I not understanding? You know what, don't answer that question. Answer this question, if you know him so well, then why'd he leave? Right. You still love him? - Did I say that? - You didn't have to. - That's not fair. - Fucking life's not fair. I'll sleep on the couch. - Evan, wait. Great. Way to go, Dani. So what time are we going to the party tonight? - After the movie. Karen's gonna cover for me. - Nice! - Mm-hmm. So you actually gonna try to get that wick slick with Sam tonight or what? - Dude. - What? I'm sorry, mister love sick stereotypical best friend role. - As a matter of a fact, I'm working on a plan to talk to her tonight. - It's easy. You're gonna walk up to her, and you're gonna say, Sam. Do you wanna fuck like jackrabbits tonight or what? - I think it takes a little bit more finesse than that. - Nah, dude. I can do it for ya. Like hell you will! - No, seriously, I can just walk right up to her and just be like, hey Sammy girl. Tristan here, he's so just lovesick and broken over you, and all he wants to do is slide that ballot into your box. Please, please, please do us a favor and screw this poor boy before he gives us 13 reasons why. - You know what, pick up your damn bag. Oh, I'm just trying to help you, man. - I don't really need your help. I've got a plan. - Oh, you've got a plan? - Yeah. - Roofies aren't a plan, bro. Those are illegal. Yeah, whatever. Hey, I gotta get going. I've got shit to do-- - Oh yeah, I'm sure you do. - Uh-huh. - All right, peace. Boom! - See ya. See ya, bitch. - Hey, cutie! What are you to? - Nothing, just working on my bike. - Well have fun, but be careful. - See ya. - See ya. Mom? Evan? Hello? Danielle? Danielle, took your mom to get some things for the house. Said she needed the fresh air. Be back later. Love you, Evan. Okay? Sam? Sammy? Listen, I really need to talk to you about the last couple of days and the way I've been acting. Sam, listen I really need to apologize to you about the other day. You know when Matt left it put me in a really bad place, and seeing him after all this time just took me right back, and I took it out on you. And you didn't deserve it, Sam. You didn't deserve any of it. I can never tell you how sorry I am, Sam. You think you can forgive me? Sam? What the hell? Sam, I know you're in here. I heard you. Seriously? You've gotta try a little harder if you wanna scare me. Somebody help me! Please? I don't wanna die. What do you want? Don't touch her! Stay away from my sister! No, no! No! - Hey girl, what's up? I'm still helping Mom out. She needed me to help her with some housework. What about you? - I'm just headed to this party. I was trying to call Danielle and let her know where I was, but she's still not answering my calls. I'm starting to think I shouldn't go to this thing. Oh no you don't. You're already on your way. Trust me, Danielle will get over whatever shitty attitude she is in. You need this. Besides, I don't wanna be stuck in keep-Brody-from-being-an-ass role all by myself. - Speaking of, when's everyone showing up to this thing? - Well, Zeke and Jenna are apparently already there. I talked to them earlier. I have no idea where Tristan is. Brody said he'll be leaving the drive-in soon, and I should just be a little longer with Mom, then I'll be there. - Great. - Just relax, I'll be there soon enough, and we can get our freak on. Cool? - Cool. Just hurry up. - Working on it. - Hmm? What? - Really? - What? - It's nice that you're so relaxed. - It is, isn't it? - This is our busiest night. You think you could take this a little more serious? - Listen, as soon as the movie is over, I'm gone, remember? That was the original agreement. So, why don't you just calm down? I have literally, I don't know, 32 minutes until I bolt? So just calm your tits. - This place is a mess, Brody. I want it clean before you bolt. - That's a negative, breaker breaker. - Excuse me? - Listen, we both know that this is a shit show of a job, okay? So come down this authoritarian vibe thing you got going on. - Okay, you listen to this. I don't know what creepy ass little soiree you're planning on going to, for all I care you can drink and screw until your heart explodes. - Oh, thank you, hon. - But for now, while you're on the clock, you do what I pay you to do. So, that means get this place spotless before you shuffle your lazy ass outta here. You get me? Last I checked, it was Max that signed the checks, not you. So why don't you, again, calm your tits. - You better learn to watch your goddamn mouth. Is it that time of the mouth? Uppity fucking cunt. Cunt with a capital K. K for Karen. What? Karen! Jesus Christ. Are you the one knocking on this door? - The screen is kinda fuzzy. Kid, fuck off. I fucking hate this job. Fuck this movie. Fucking hell! Oh! Where is she? - She's not here. She's on her way down to the hospital. She's lost a lot of blood. I don't think she's gonna make it. You don't wanna go down there. It's fine. All right, go ahead. - I'm surprised her intestines didn't fall out on the floor. - Ma'am, do you at least remember what time you got home? - Tammy? It's me, Matt. What happened here? - My baby. My baby girl. - I'm so sorry, Tammy. But what happened? Where were you, where was Evan? - Evan left for a while. - What do you mean? - I had to get cleaning supplies. He said he had to go to the office for work reasons. We were only supposed to be gone a few minutes. I should have been here. I never should have left. - Where's Sammy? - I think she's with Sean. She needs to know. She needs to be told. - Tammy, Sean's dead. He's been dead for over a year. You knew that. - Did I? - Tammy, I need you to focus. Where's Sammy? - Why? Why my baby? Why, Matthew? - Tammy, where's Sam? - There she is. - Hey. - Hey! - What's up? - So, where's our host? - Tara? - Yeah. - I dunno, kinda figured she'd be strutting it up in here. - No, no, give it some time. Look, I predict she's gonna be butt naked being Chinese finger cuffed by two random dudes before the night's over. - That's so fucking gross, Zeke. - It's true, it's Tara. - You never know. - Still think this is a bad idea. - Hey! Oh, what took y'all so long? - Actually, my mother let me bail early, but I didn't get my stuff. - Moving that stupid furniture around? - Mm-hmm. - Yeah, I just had something going on. - Yeah. - Well, I've already had three beers and I'm feeling pretty good. So both of you need to catch up. - Oh, fucking A we do, yeah. Where's the beer? Over here, okay. - I gotta pee. - Hey wait, do you need help with that? - Yeah, go and help her take a piss, bro. - Yeah, you might need to wipe for her. - Ooh. - Whoa. - Don't listen to these miscreants, Tristan. I, for one, think it was a sweet gesture. - Wow, miscreants, huh? Can you even spell that, Miss Willis? - Yeah! Actually yeah, I can. It's spelled F-U-C-K O-F-F. Oh, and I can even sign it. - Fuck off, fuck off. - Come on, Tristan, come help me wipe. - Ooh, there's my lover boy. - Boo! - Hey you. - Hey. Hey look, I'm sorry about face raping you back there. I just get tired of them making fun of you all the time, you know? - Oh yeah, trust me, I know. - Well. - Hey, I actually wanna talk to you about that. - What? - We're best friends, right? - Yeah. - Well, ever since Sean died I really haven't had a chance to tell you, or I didn't know how to approach it. - Approach what? - That kiss back there, Sam? That wasn't horsing around. I know the difference. - Tristan, that-- - Just hold on. You are my best friend. You know I'd be there for you in a heartbeat, right? I mean why don't we just take it to the next level? I mean I know I'm not prime dating material, but I think we can work this out. - Tristan, your great, I'm not ready. It's just not like-- - Yeah, yeah. It's not you, it's me, right? - No! Tristan, it's not like that. - Whatever, forget it. Tristan! - Hey hot mama. Where'd lover boy go? - Away. I really think I messed him up this time. - Well, Sam, Tristan is a big boy. He'll get over it, okay. But I just got a text from Brody, and apparently his car isn't starting, so I have to go pick him up. So I'll be right back. - No! Tess, no, please don't. Come on, I wanna talk to you right now. - I know, I know. Just 15 minutes. 15 minutes, I'll be right back and we can do this, okay? 15 minutes. - 15? - 15. - You sure? You promise. - Yeah, 15. - 15! - Fine! - Hurry, hurry! - Hey. - Hey. - Give me the keys. - What? - Give me the keys. - What for? - It's getting kind of hot out here and I'm feeling not hot. Just let me freshen up. - Babe, it's not that big of a deal. - I know you don't think it is, but I do, and that's what's important. - Nuh-uh.

Oh my god. He's out there. He killed Zeke and Jenna. - All right, where's he at? - I don't know. I think he cut the phone lines. - Stay away from Sam! - Evan, what are you doing here? - Okay, leave her alone, Matt. Put it down, Evan. - Fuck you! Put yours down first. - I'm not gonna tell you again. Don't make me do this, Evan. - Don't you fucking get it, Sam? He's the fucking killer. He fucking killed your friends. He fucking, he fucking killed Dani. - Danielle. - Don't try to pin this-- No, fucking admit it! Ad-fucking-mit it! - Back off! Don't even try to pin this on me. You were the last one to see her alive. Why'd you flee the scene, Evan? Don't you understand? That's why I'm here. I heard what was going down tonight, and came to make sure you were all-- - Fuck you, fucking liar! You're fucking full of shit. None of this happened until you showed back up. - Don't. - Why'd you fucking kill her? Huh? Why'd you fucking kill her? - I didn't, you piece of shit, and you know it. I talked to Tammy. You left her alone for an hour, Evan. How'd you know Sam was gonna be here? - Fuck you! None of this shit happened until you fucking showed back up. You fucking disappeared for a year? None of the shit's a fucking coincidence. - I didn't kill Dani. - I'm gonna fucking kill you. - No! No. - Sam, you all right? Come on. - Don't come closer. - Sam, calm down. Listen to me. - How did you know where I was, Matt? Listen to me. - Where are the rest of the police? Where is the Sheriff? - Listen, department's spread paper thin tonight, because of your sister and the death at the drive-in. I think it was one of your friends. I came to make sure you were okay. I need you to calm down and listen to me. - Matt watch out! Matt! What do you want? - Just you. - Tess? - Peek-a-boo. Aw, what's wrong Sammy? At a loss for words? Here, let me help you. What, why, how? Am I right? - You killed them? - Ah, yeah I did. Why? - That's a long, long story, puppy. I don't understand. They were your friends. We were your friends. - Hmm, no you were my friend. The others were just pawns. They always were. - I don't-- - You don't what? Understand? I mean, I don't blame you. It's not like you ever paid any attention to details. I mean all the times I tried to give you hints, all the times I tried to explain things to you, but you were just too goddamn oblivious to them. Even while you were dating my brother, Sean. So I had to get rid of him. Wait, you really thought Sean drowned? No. - You killed Sean? You killed your own brother? - You're goddamn right I did. Why, Tess? - Isn't it obvious, Sammy? Because you're here. Because I love you. Ever since I've met you, everything I've done has been for you. And then you started dating my brother, and let's face it, we had our fair share of sibling rivalry. But I couldn't fucking deal with the fact that he took you away from me. But, you looked happy. And after I felt that one out in my head for a while, I thought fuck it. You know, that's what you do when you love someone, you put aside all your selfish feelings and just be happy for that person, right? So I tried moving on and started dating Brody for a little while. And I thought focusing on someone else would have made not having you to myself more bearable. Hey, it worked, for like a minute. But then I found something out. There are things about my brother that not even you knew. So I'm out here, as I am to do ever so often, and what do I see? My brother and Monica getting rather intimate with each other. - You killed my sister, you stupid bitch. - Now now, Sammy. That is not a very nice thing to say to me. I mean after everything I've been through for you. Stop shaking. I mean seriously, Sammy! After everything I have been through for you! And you're gonna act like this. - You're a fucking psychopath. You've murdered people, Tess. You're a goddamn murderer. What, did you think I was just gonna sit here and act like everything was not completely fucked? - Is it naive of me to say yes? - Fuck you. - Okay. Don't, Tess. - Come here. - Hey now. - All right. Hello mister law man. You're pretty handsome. - Tess, leave him alone! - I can kinda see why Dani was keeping you around. If it wasn't for Sammy over here, I would have a go at you myself. - Are you gonna kill me or fuck me? 'Cause I'm getting some mixed signals right now. - Oh, a feisty one, huh? - No! - See what you made me do, Sam? Look at you. Aw, where are you going, sweetness? I'll get you. Sammy? You know, I love ya, I do. But, I'm kind of starting to feel like you don't feel the same way. And I mean, that would kinda suck, because you know I have been through a lot for ya. You know? I mean, I would hate to kill ya. Hey, puppy, come here. Come here! Ow! Goddamn it! No. - Come here. - Oh. - Come here, Sammy. I wouldn't have to hurt you if you would stop fighting me, Jesus! So what's it gonna be, Sammy, huh? Huh, I can end this now. We can mend your wounds, we can move on together. Huh, just those three little words. I, love-- - Go fuck yourself! - Okay, all right. All right, I would have done anything for you. - Then give me the people I love back! - No, but I can send you to meet them. Oh Jesus fucking Christ, was there a mass message sent out to everyone to save Sammy here? God, I thought you ran away with the rest of the cattle. - Listen, I've had one shitfuck of a night. I got a migraine the size of Texas, and there are dead bodies everywhere. So I'd really appreciate it if you'd just tell me what the fuck is going on? - Tristan, it's her! Tess killed everyone! - Okay, I did not kill everyone, okay? Evan's not on me. That was deputy dipshit in there. - What about Matt? And Zeke and Jenna? - Okay, you got me there. Okay, Trist, I'm gonna make a deal with ya. All right? - What? Is this the part of the movie where you're gonna say, "Oh, I'll kill you quick and painless?" - Ew, cute, no. No see I haven't tried to kill you, have I? Could have, but I didn't. You know, I thought Sammy isn't really seeing things how I thought she was gonna see, and it's kinda ungrateful. So how about this, I kill her and you let me walk? - You know, I'm not really seeing the upside to this deal, Tess. - Well for fuck's sake, you should. I mean I killed everyone that has ever given me grief. You know, kind of a scumbag and everything. You know, I mean hell, Sammy over here broken your heart so many times I can't even count. You know, just keeping you around just to knock you back down like you weren't anything. - Well, she's right, Sam. She hasn't tried to kill me yet. - Tristan, please. - Oh what are the odds of that, huh? A fucking misfire. - Tess! - Hey! It's okay. It's okay. - You kids all right? - Yeah, how's Evan. - He's lost a lot of blood, but I think he's gonna make it. He's on his way to the hospital right now. - What about Matt? - Did you find her? - Tess? No, not yet. It's a big lake. We're gonna start dragging the bottom, but it's gonna take a while. Parts of that lake are several hundred meters deep. Don't worry, we're gonna find her. - Tell me I killed her, Sheriff. Just tell me this is over. - Well three rounds straight to the chest? I don't know a man alive that can survive that, or woman. - Tristan, you saved my life. - I'm pretty sure it was the other way around, but you can tell everybody that's how it went down. What was that for? - For everything, and I love you. - It's about damn time.
