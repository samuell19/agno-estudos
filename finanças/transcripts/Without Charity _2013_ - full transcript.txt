(slow somber music) - I mean I read a thing just here recently saying we leave you and and we're sorry that you had to spend seven years of your life in prison for a stupid mistake that you made when you were 17. But you know a stupid mistake is when your mom and dad aren't home and they left the car and you back it back and forth up the driveway and hit the garage door or you steal pumpkins and you smash them someplace. That's a stupid mistake. In my opinion she made a very conscious choice on what she did. It was a lot more than a stupid mistake that affected lots and lots and lots people's lives. She didn't pull the trigger but in my opinion she put the gun in Stroud's hand. I mean do you really think that Stroud and the rest of them would've ever went to the Sears' home without Charity. It wouldn't have happened. (slow somber music) - On September 14th of 2000 the St. Joseph's County Police dispatch center had received a 911 call from a secretary at Arndt Construction telling us that there were three construction workers that had been found by another employee on Oak Road at a job site that were found in the barn down, hands bound, lying in pools of blood. If I had to describe the crime scene in one word it would be horrific. You got three hard working men construction workers at a job site. They're down on the ground face down, hands bound behind their backs and each one of them executed. (electronic static) - [VOICEOVER] It's a crime that has rocked Bremen. - It doesn't happen here. It shouldn't happen here. - I'm just shook up that three people got killed and we can't find out who it is. - We're worried. We live out in the country. We're kind of worried. - [VOICEOVER] Folks who live here are frustrated over the killings. - They know nothing and they wonder what did happen. - There was a lot of anger in the community and I just remember so many people coming over to give hugs and offer support and share memories. I just remember feeling really safe and protected and really loved. My son's teacher Mrs. Huff at the time he was in kindergarten I remember I talked to her and I said "Just please watch over him" (woman crying) 'cause it was really hard to let him leave to go to school because at that point I felt like anytime somebody left me I might not see them again. (slow somber music) - [VOICEOVER] A normally quiet rural part of southern St. Joseph County busy with investigators and squad cars late in the afternoon. - [VOICEOVER] As police look for answers to this murder mystery. - We're at the very front end of this thing. It's going take us sometime to get a picture and a handle on what really transpired here. - [VOICEOVER] Special crimes commander Mike Swanson remains cautiously optimistic about finding who's responsible for Thursday's triple murder. - We're all tired. We're gonna to work throughout the night and I can just tell you that we're gaining some ground. ♪ And know the regret ♪ Where it's such a shame ♪ And all that we say ♪ Is who's ♪ Who's to blame - Through the investigation we were able to learn that the four individuals involved, in case the four suspects, had made a plan to burglarize this home. They had received information from Charity Payne that the people who lived at this home were extremely wealthy and were told that there would be a lot of money in the house. The four individuals got up that day on the 14th of September in 2000. They left Walnut Street in South Bend in route out to the house on Oak Road to the Sears' property. A long the way they stopped at a gas station at Prairie and Olive Street. They went inside. They bought some gloves and some other items and then they drove to the home. They'd been there the previous day knew where the house was at how far back off the road the house sat. The gate evidently was open. They were told by Charity that if the gate was closed that indicated that somebody was home. The gate was probably left open that day for the construction workers, the deliver of the lumber. When they got there they were evidently startled that the construction workers were in the barn. And from that point they made the decision or Phillip Stroud made the decision that they were going to have to kill these people because they had seem them. They had seen their vehicle possibly even seen the plate on the car. (slow somber music) (slow piano music) - We were close. I was the daddy's little girl. I was the only girl in the family. My mom would tell stories about how when I was born he wouldn't hold me because he was afraid he was gonna break me. - I remember my biological father once saying to him that he was glad that I had someone like him in my life to help raise me, to be there at times when he couldn't always be. We were all his kids. If someone said how many do you have he would say I have six kids. And when people talked about steps and stepchildren or step parents he would say we don't have those kind of steps in our house. The only kind of steps we have are the ones that go downstairs to upstairs. - My last experience was when I had to have cancer removed from my side. I needed to borrow some money for the the doctor's visit basically and he loaned me $500.00 And he said "I'm not loaning it to you. "I'm giving it to you because I'm your dad." And that's I think the last time I seen him. - The last time I saw my dad alive he had stopped by the house during lunch and I was home. And we just spent about an hour just eating lunch together and talking and then hanging out with the kids. His birthday was in September and the last time I called my dad he didn't call back 'cause I called him to see if he wanted to meet for dinner for his birthday. And it was the day he died and he never returned my phone call. - My children were born on September the 7th. I was told I'd never have kids and he was always an encouragement saying "You know what it'll happen someday." And so when I did become pregnant he was probably just as excited as I was to see that it finally was gonna happen. My children were born on September the 7th. He was murdered on September the 14th. Unfortunately they were three months premature. So they were iddy-biddy babies. He could've held them but he was afraid. So he was gonna wait till they came home. (slow somber music) Unfortunately by the time they came home he was gone. So he never got to see them. On that day he had just recently retired and his brother had a doctor's appointment, Calvin and called Wayne to see if he wanted to come to work that day because he was gonna be gone and so they were gonna be short a person. My mom has this board, a dry erase board and the morning that he left... He would always tell her he loved her goodbye very predictable, home at 5 o'clock for supper meat and potatoes kind of guy. She wasn't up right then when he left and so on the dry erase board he wrote "Love you" to her on there. And she still has that board. It's never been erased. It sits and that's the last thing I know that he wrote. - [VOICEOVER] On Thursday three construction workers were found murdered. And tonight we may know why. - Eighteen year old Charity Payne... - [VOICEOVER] More on this case... - [VOICEOVER] Charity Payne. - [VOICEOVER] Eighteen year old Charity Payne... - Led the group of suspects to the Lakeville home. - When Charity's picture came up I remember in the beginning it being odd that there's this white girl that's from this community but the other's weren't. I mean I think a couple of them they actually got from Detroit maybe. So to place them in that community to do a robbery was very puzzling. - She seemed like a small town girl not much different maybe than me growing up in this small town. It just kind of seemed familiar. And to do something like that to a family that she knew because she was involved with that family previously just was shocking to me that somebody could do that. - Well, as far as I knew she was always a happy child thought life was good seemed like a normal family. I guess those there was things going on that I didn't know about. She grew up different things that happened to her when she was a child. We were so close. I mean we were like best friends. We talked about everything. She always told me everything. I guess I should've been a little bit more aware when she quit talking. - Charity is the first friend I ever remember having. We went through elementary school, middle school and high school all together. Later on with the things that happened you kind of you could see the pattern forming. - That summer we were hanging out together every day and almost once a day I found myself in a position where I did not feel safe because she just doesn't understand that people you've known for 20 years you should trust a lot more than people you've known for five minutes. I mean she's just got that kind of personality. She's really outgoing and she really likes to talk to people which is great. But she doesn't understand that there are certain indicators that maybe they're not the kind of people you wanna be talking to. - Right before we graduated our senior year she kind of started to hang out with people that I wasn't really comfortable hanging out with. - I think Charity never really knew what you're taught as a little kid of stranger danger. She never really knew that you should be afraid of certain people or maybe you shouldn't let people in quite as much as she always just did. (slow somber music) - I can think back very specific things see their faces very clearly remember very specific things but (electronic static) I don't really have much audio. It's almost like everything's surreal. It's like looking at a picture and having no sound. - That day she was borrowing my car to go to her work orientation but I didn't hear from her for a really long time after she dropped me off at work. - I was driving towards where my job interview was going to be and I ended up in a neighborhood that I didn't know where I was didn't recognize any of the streets or people and made a wrong turn at a stop sign and at the stop sign Phillip then was in the middle of the road and saying "Hey, come over here, hey." Well, he had started talking to me through the driver's side of my window. We had talked about friends we had in common names that popped up. I was like, "Hey, I know that guy" so a lot of common ground. I know that John the boy I was dating knew a guy named Punkin who is actually Phillip's cousin. Then in conversation came up "Yeah, that family's wealthy" or "They're rich". "They have this huge pool" or "They have this pond." Still at this point you don't know you're sitting next to a cold blooded murderer. Just no idea, have no idea. They never used the word burglary or robbery. That they were going to go actually commit a crime. And at that time I really didn't understand the unwinding of it all. I know at one point he had already made it clear that he had a weapon and he needed me to run him somewhere real quick. But he ran in there and he came back out with another co-defendant of mine which became known as Tyrone. And that's when he was like you're gonna drive us by the Sears' residence. At that point I was like well I don't really have much choice but to do what he's asked me to because he's in my car with a weapon. And he had already told me I do remember that he... We don't have to stop. That was a very, very clear memory I have. He said we're not gonna stop or we don't have to stop or anything. We were just gonna drive by it. They just wanted to see it. (slow somber music) - When she came to drop the keys off she was a lot later than I expected her to be since she was just doing a orientation. She wasn't gonna be gone for a long time. And when she came to drop the keys off she was getting ready to go to her other job and when she handed me the keys all I remember her saying is "I really need to talk to you." Something was wrong I didn't know what it was and I didn't know it was as bad as it was. But I know that when she handed me those keys she was not anything except for scared. - He was pretty... a person of habit. At our house the whole time growing up supper was at 5 o'clock. We sat at the table all together as a family. When it came around that time and he hadn't called and he wasn't home my mom called his cellphone a few times. Didn't get any response or anything which was not like him at all. And as time went on and she continued to call his phone and got no response I think sometimes you just get that feeling that something's not right. - All the kids were in bed. My husband and I were in bed. Everybody was sleeping and I had just gone to bed and I got a phone call from my oldest brother, Tony and he said he said "Dad's been shot." And I said, "Okay, well what hospital do I need to go to?" And he said, "You don't understand "he's not alive." - I didn't really believe it until I went and seen him and that was at the funeral home. Because I was told not to even touch my dad's body in the funeral home because his head was totally blowed off, half of it and they had putty fillin' it. What really got me is when I got the death report when it said multiple gun shot wounds to the head. How many times does it take to shoot somebody in the head before you kill 'em. But I never got his wallet back, his cellphone back. But I got his watch, his glasses, his lighter, his ring. But I keep them in a bio hazard bag because there's blood everywhere on 'em. I tried to clean them up the best I could but I couldn't. - [VOICEOVER] Three more suspects. - [VOICEOVER] Three construction workers - [VOICEOVER] The grieving continues for families and friends. - [VOICEOVER] And who's responsible for Thursday's triple murder. - [VOICEOVER] Corby Meyer's was part of the Bremen Lion football tradition here. - He's always been a real good friend ever since he's left school and just it's a shame. - These are the kind of people that wouldn't have enemies who'd be looking to do something like this. Hoping St. Joe County will be to to get to the bottom of this and get some answers. - I got the call that they had discovered three bodies in the Lakeville area shortly after the police knew about it so and I went to the scene that afternoon or that evening. So I was involved in it from almost the beginning of the discovery of the bodies. So I was able to view the scene from one of the doorways where the bodies were located. I just remember vividly thinking that we're gonna need a miracle to solve this one simply because we were so out in the middle of nowhere and it just didn't make any sense. It wasn't one of the kind of crimes where you'd round up the usual suspects 'cause it was just so bizarre. - I received the phone call the morning after the homicides from our dispatch center saying that a woman had called in that Charity Payne worked for her. And on the previous evening Charity Payne had broke down after finding out that the triple homicide had occurred. And started crying and said that she thought she was responsible for those deaths. - I just remember my heart sinking everything draining out of my body and dropping to my knees and because even knowing what I talked about with those guys that day not thinking it could've been turned into even a burglary then you hear murder. - We went to bed and about 2 o'clock in the morning she called, needed a ride. She was done workin'. So I went and got her. And all the way home she was just really quiet. She didn't say anything. She just kind of watched out the passenger window like didn't look at me or anything you know. So anyhow the next morning at about 10 o'clock somebody came and knocked on my front door. So I opened the door and there's two gentleman standing out there. And they told me who they were and that they wanted to talk to her that they thought she might know something about what happen out there. And they said would you mind going with us down to the special crimes place and talking to us. And I still had no idea, nothing. You know if I'd a had a clue I'd a never let her go with them. - I believe she was at the special crimes unit building for I wanna say seven hours. At the time we did that she was not technically under arrest. We had brought her parents down and she wasn't being interrogated the entire time. A lot of it she was sitting in a room waiting for us to bring people in for her to identify through the closed circuit system we had there. - A few times I even because of the exhaustion and the trauma and the stress was sleepy and would fall a sleep curled up in a ball in the corner in a chair. And they would come back in and wake me up and ask me more questions. And it went on for about 12 hours. - Through the investigation we were able to learn that Charity Payne had met four individuals, four male blacks at Scottsdale Mall the previous day. She was with her girlfriend ran into these individuals just before leaving. Charity had a conversation with them and had given her phone number as well as I believe her girlfriend's phone number. - She was just really naive. And I think it's really hard for people to understand that because even myself with her knowing she was that way I would always find myself going why did you do that? Why did you give those people my phone number? Why did you let those guys in the back of my car? I mean she just was always doing things that any rational person would know was not a safe thing to do. - On Wednesday Charity had taken her girlfriend's car after dropping her off at school on the premise that she was going to go for an orientation for a job on the westside of South Bend at a local supermarket. Charity actually was not going there. All indications are is that Charity had every intent of finding some marijuana and contacting these individuals to do it. - I don't know necessarily that it was drugs. I mean I really don't think that's probably why she went there. I mean I think it was someone was paying attention to her and Charity would... I mean she would drop her best friends at the drop of a hat if somebody else was giving her... and that's just kind of always the way she was. And then I think she got in a situation that she couldn't really get herself out of. - I can tell you I was not over there to buy drugs. It ate me up, tore me up, just irritated the... irritated me to death because they wanted me so bad to say that because it would make sense to them. - Initially her story to us was that basically she was stopped on the street, someone got in. They knew her ex-boyfriend John Sears and they started asking her the questions which was completely untrue. None of these individuals, none of the suspects knew of the Sears family, John Sears anybody. It was during the course of conversation that she brought up the Sears family and how much money they had. And during the course of conversation between the suspects they were kept talking about "the white girls got lick". And "lick" is street lingo for a robbery. - I'm not saying I was completely innocent never at any point in this. But more of this has gotten thrown on me in the picked a part details. I can only go so far and accept so much responsibility for that regardless of how it turned out. - From court documents of a videotaped interview 18 year old Charity Payne told investigators that she told the other suspects about the families financial status, how to bypass the home security system, about the maid service schedule, and their unpublished number. She states suspect Phillip Stroud had a gun and claimed he would kill anyone found in the home. - When it went from conversation to taking them to the location that's when she should've known that this is for real. And they're probably really planning on doing what they're talking about doing. - You're not me. You didn't go through what I went there. So you're not gonna sit there and pick it a part like that. That makes sense to me though. You're not gonna understand that. I didn't sit in the car with Phillip that day. I didn't plan a robbery. - We thought we were taking her home with us that she was just talking to 'em and then about 10 o'clock at night they called us in this little room and told us that they were charging her with murder. It just didn't even seem real, okay. I literally beat my head against a wall. When I got home sat on the floor and just cried and... You just can't even imagine honestly what goes through a parent's mind and I mean it just crushed us. - When this all happened it happened quickly. It was she met these guys one day and the very next day the crime occurred. So she didn't have time to think about it. And I think she thought that she could talk to me and I could tell her either this is dangerous. I mean like that this really may happen. I think she thought she had more time to stop it if there was something to be stopped. And you gotta understand too that Charity hung out with a lot of people that said they were gonna do a lot of stuff that they were never gonna do. I think she was torn between being scared for herself and hoping that what these guys were talking about was all talk and nothing was really gonna happen. - Knowing her she wouldn't have hurt a fly. She wouldn't hurt a fly. She just ran her mouth to the wrong people and very bad people. - We have prepared charges for felony murder against Ms. Payne and they're awaiting a judge's determination of probable cause tomorrow. - About two years had lapsed between when the crime happened and when she went to trial and I could tell that things weren't going so well as far as the way that they were portraying her in the media. It was a huge case. It was publicized nonstop every chance they had to bring it all up they did in media. So at that point I felt like everybody if you talked to any random person on the street they would know about the case based on the things that they'd watched on the news. So I didn't think that there wasn't a single person in this area who didn't already have a predetermined opinion of her before the trial. So I felt like there was no way she was ever gonna get a fair trail in this area. - She was the first one to go to trial and I knew at that point it was gonna be all about someone needs to be punished. - She planned it. (inaudible dialect) this would've happened without her. She planned it. She was responsible. She should be held accountable. - Had the killer actually gone to trial before her I think her case would've worked out very differently. - She was charged first just simply because we had the information on her first and then the others as we worked the case the charges came in later. And it simply was just there was no reason to continue her trial. We were ready to go. Defense was ready to go. It just happened that way. It really wasn't a conscience decision on our part. - The trials went over forever. They went on for seven years. We were in and out of the courthouse because of the number of people involved and all the appeals and everything that happened. The most troubling memories for me during the trial involving Charity would be that when she always tried to play the sweet innocent girl and the first time she came to court she came to court in cornrows in her hair and her lawyer had gotten really mad at her. And said this is not the look we're going for. So I think that her lawyer was trying to make her look like a sweet innocent girl and really that's not who she is inside. I think that she portrayed herself as who she was that first time when she came into the courtroom. - I read in the papers and stuff how she was portrayed as such a little princess or whatever cheerleader all this it just made me more angry. Well, I don't care what she used to be. She's not that today. I used to be a high school football star. I'm not today. I don't know just everybody acted like she was the victim out of the deal. - You had in this case a dichotomy. You had a group young black men from the rough side of town and then you had this young white girl with good parents, good family background. One of the things that I really wanted to have happen is that everyone be held accountable for what happened not just the one that had the private rich... 'Cause she was the only one that had private retained counsel. All the other defendants couldn't afford that so they had public defenders. And nothing against public defenders or anything but you had not kind of social issue going on here. - Police believe eighteen year old Charity Payne led the group of suspects to the Lakeville home. Right now she is charged with felony burglary. Tomorrow the prosecutor hopes to add three counts of felony murder. - The fact that I had charged her with felony murder was not necessarily a popular decision among some of my colleagues just simply because some of them felt that well she wasn't present. She wasn't there. In essence how would she have known that was gonna happen. All she knew maybe was that this burglary was gonna happen. The way our law is if you're in with a group of people and you're helping this group of people commit a crime everyone's responsible for everyone else's actions. In this particular situation if you go out to break into a home and someone dies as a result of it that's felony murder. (slow somber music) - Most of all the trial I did attend. It was overwhelming. I never thought that I would learn about gun ballistics and how a bullet spins when it's shot and how they can get this bullet to line up with this gun. I think that a lot of times I felt like the person on trial really has more rights and more things that can be said about them than the person who's dead. I felt sometimes like maybe the jurors didn't get didn't know who Wayne and Corby and Lynn really were didn't know that they were... Corby's fiance was pregnant with his first child or Lynn's family or Wayne. I don't know I guess in a trial I just think that it should be more fair that the jurors should also have to hear about the victim. Some of that stuff was just they need to hear that society has made you do the things that you've done or that you came from a battered home or that you had beer put in your bottle when you were you a baby and those... You hear all of those things kind of in my opinion was trying to get the jury to be sympathetic that oh my gosh this poor person. They had all of these things bad happen to 'em when they were growing up and that's why they did what they did. I remember (slow somber music) the day that they talked about the autopsy and learning where the bullet went in where the bullet came out and then seeing pictures that sort of made the person unrecognizable if you didn't know who they were. You see gun shot things on TV all the time but it doesn't really prepare you for what it actually looks like. And I remember that day having to cover my mouth and not being able to breathe and wishing I wouldn't have looked but it was too late. It was already there on the screen in the courtroom. - We had asked to be told when they were gonna show those pictures because we didn't want to see them. And so instead I watched her face and there was no reaction to what she saw. And I guess that always just kind of set in my mind kind of her feelings towards what had happened that she felt like she wasn't involved in that this wasn't her doing. - I was advised to keep everything in. Because if I were to have said I was sorry or cried or any of those things that I was feeling as a human that they would be taken by people or the victim's family members anyone else as insincere. I didn't want to come across and... What do you say to someone in that case? I'm sorry will never be enough. - I felt like she should've spoken that she should've got up and been honest about her involvement in the crimes because not only did it effect her trial but it effected all the trials. And the fact that she wasn't speaking kind of made it harder to prosecute the other people that were involved. - Her attorney was very experienced very capable defense attorney. And usually it's been my experience as a prosecutor that whenever a defendant gets up and testifies in their behalf they essentially dig their own grave. They don't come across very well. So it was probably one of those situations where he didn't wanna put her on the stand because he felt maybe she would come across worse than she did just by sitting there and portraying this young innocent girl that just simply was on the wrong side of the tracks. - Her trial was really hard. I remember sitting in the witness stand and looking at her lawyer waiting for him to ask me a question that might actually help her. I mean 'cause I had sat a couple of days before in the witness stand for the prosecution and answered a lot of questions that I knew were gonna hurt her. And tried to not make them twist my words into something that were gonna hurt her but it's kind of hard to do. 'Cause there were something that just did make her look bad. - [VOICEOVER] The prosecutor countered that the murders of three construction workers killed during a burglary on the job site simply would not have happened without Payne. Payne told the murderers a way to enter the home without sounding the burglar alarm that being through the same second story window her ex-boyfriend used to sneak out of to meet Payne when the two were dating. On the witness stand today that ex-boyfriend also talked about a letter Payne once wrote to him the letter pointed out how easy it would be to rob the restaurant Payne was working at at the time. - I felt that the fact that we found this other letter where she was attempting to have someone else commit a serious crime kind of negating that argument that this was just a mistake 'cause she did it before. - Nothing that's documented in the letter ever actually took place. We tried to fight and get it thrown out just had no relevance but of course it was taken as their character reference of me and my mindset and my ability or capability to do these types of things. - Her attorney would not ever let us talk to the media and put our side of the story out or her life or what kind of person she really was. Sometimes I think if we'd have been able to do that it may have helped how the media made her look. - At first I was very thankful for the media because really that was the only information that we were getting because the police were not giving us much. They were call and they would give you little tidbits just enough to make you want more and then they would come to your house and interview you. They went as far as to... We asked them not to come to my dad's funeral. And they were outside trying to videotape and ask people questions at that point. And that was really troublesome to me that they would push it to the level to where it was almost intrusive on the time that you were trying to grieve. - [VOICEOVER] A simple burglary authorities believe started with this woman. - [VOICEOVER] She provide a lot of information about the house in question. - [VOICEOVER] A home Payne told her new found friends all about when they told her they needed money. - The Charity that I saw on the news was not the Charity that I knew. A lot of people formulated their opinions of her through what they saw on the news and I don't blame them because if I didn't know her I would probably think the exact same thing. - I just feel that they had already all had their minds made up before the trial even began. The media, the public, everybody they had their minds made up that she was the ring leader, the mastermind and deserved every bit of whatever she got. - [VOICEOVER] Charity Payne didn't fire the shots. She called the shots that turned the home of her ex-boyfriend into the scene of a triple murder. - You would ask people "Well, was she there when that happened?" And they'd say, "Yeah, she was." They had no idea what really happened. That she was nowhere near that house when those people were killed. And honestly if she was she would probably be dead because there's no way she would let that happen. - I wish that it would have went differently where those people could've seen me and not what the media and everybody else painted. They just made me to be a monster and a mastermind. - [VOICEOVER] Payne first suggested Stroud burglarize the upscale home of her ex-boyfriend. - [VOICEOVER] Provided the inside information about the home of her ex-boyfriend. - [VOICEOVER] She told the killers her ex-boyfriend's house was a good target for robbery. - People like this just shouldn't be allowed to be on the streets. - I would say just so broken (slow piano music) to be looked at like this thing and picked apart to know yourself better than anyone else nobody's listening it's horrible. To stare at people and watch them judge you and they just don't know It's like I'm a human too. I'm a person. (loud bang) - A jury decided she was just as responsible for the triple homicide as anyone who carried it out. - [VOICEOVER] Charity Payne left the courtroom in tears facing hard time learning a lesson the hard way. - I hope it offers some kind of message that you're not gonna be able to be excused for certain things that you do. - My first reaction honestly was a little bit of relief to know that she would be in prison for the rest of her life for her involvement. A little bit later then I started thinking about it as a parent's side and my heart kind of broke for her mom. Because I started thinking if that were my child how that would hurt to see her go through that and then to hear that sentence and just to know that my daughter was forever be locked away. - Yes, she was involved and things may have not happened to way they did had she not talked to these people and said what she said to them. But I did not believe that she should've been found guilty of three counts of murder and spend the rest of her life in prison. She should pay for her role in what happened. But I didn't believe that she got a fair judgment. - I also had the judge that proceeded over her trial come into Luigi's Pizza and told me that she would never see the light of day as long as he was alive. But I still feel that they used her as an example. Like I said everything was overruled, objected to, thrown out, not even the right representation. They just wasn't for Charity, the State nobody. - I mean in my opinion I think she should've been on death row too but I think that all of the family members had a relief that these people heard the story, saw the evidence, and knew that she was guilty of the crime that was committed of and set her sentencing accordingly. - You know somebody that has been your best friend your whole life and who's been there for you through thick and thin and has been such a strong friend in your life it's really hard to hear somebody say that they deserve death. - After the sentencing I really did feel like she was going to go die in prison. I thought for the rest of my life she's going to get one day a year where she gets a picnic with 30 people and that's gonna be the highlight of her year and that's all she's got. (slow somber music) (slow somber music) - My first memory of Charity Payne was I'm on the block standing out basically doing what I was doing every day was hustling in my neighborhood. Where I'm from car any car that we don't recognize... It's really not supposed to be no cars that come through our neighborhood that we don't recognize. Then when I see that it was a female then I just stood in the middle of the street and stopped the car. That was really it that's how I first met her. She told me her name. Told her my name and I think we went looking for some weed or somethin'. Stopped by one of my spots and got some got some weed and I think we smoked. Matter of fact I know we smoked a blunt. I can't really remember all the details completely but we end up going out to what I later found out was the Sears' residence. But it's really nothing too much that I can say about Charity Payne because I didn't know her but for a brief second. And I mislead her. I mislead her. The reality is I killed three people. I killed Wayne Shumaker, Corby Meyers, and Lynn Ganger. And I wanna make that clear because I know in prison everybody else in this prison is innocent of the crime that they were convicted of but I'm not. And I'm not proud of that. And it took me a long time to admit that. For a long time I had to even get over the mental hurdle of referring to my victims as my victims. I would always say the victims to like separate it from myself another way of really not taking ownership. I accept full responsibility. This is not Charity's fault. This is not my mother's fault for being poor. This is not my father's fault for being gone. I gotta live with the fact that I killed three innocent men for nothing. (slow somber music) - I did spent a big chunk of my growing up life here even if it wasn't... A long time when you think about the years I grew up majorly here. And actually this little fenced in area right here it's kind of hard to see through right here 'cause all the layers but right in through here that's where we would have our picnic every year. If you were sentenced to 35 years or more you got a picnic once a year. You could pick 30 people to come in. And I would get to come over for four hours and eat food with my family and definitely something we looked forward to every year if we were serving an indeterminate amount of time. - I can't change the way nobody else feel but I know she didn't instruct me to do anything. She didn't instruct me to kill nobody. She didn't instruct me to rob nobody. What I get from her if she knew that anything that she said would lead to anybody gettin' hurt let alone killed, murdered that she wouldn't have had no parts in that. And she just unknowingly gave me enough information to do the wrong things that I already wanted to do. - Yeah, I remember a million times walking out this door to get something or out this door to unload a truck and thinking it's so weird. The whole world's right there. Like that truck driver just drove in here and he gets to drive right out. You have to always remind yourself that the world didn't stop turning around you. Life did go on. If you stayed trapped where you were when you walked in that place you'd come out the same person. You need to see life going on around you. - But the reality is she was a 18 year old girl. I mean she was a 18 year old girl. And I been on the streets since I was 11 years old. So that was 10 years at the time. So I know manipulation and all of that when I see it. And she wasn't a mastermind. She was just a young girl really at the wrong place at the wrong time. (slow somber music) - My birthday is March 13th and I believe on the 14th my counselor called me down and told me my attorneys had contacted her and needed me to call them. So I called them right after my birthday that year. And they said, "How would you feel about going home in April?" (woman gasping) I was like, "Are you kidding me?" And I think verbatim that's what I said. And my lawyer said I would not kid you about this. - The two issues that I thought were central to the reversal one was frustrating because it was based upon law that hadn't existed at the time. After we did that and tried the case another case came down from the appellate court that established kind of what they call a per se rule that after so many hours is looked upon it as a coercive kind of interview situation. And we happen to go beyond the certain of amount of hours that this case sat. And that parameter or that case didn't exist at the time we did what we did. - There's more too it than just the Miranda rights being screwed up and things that went wrong. There were details that were swept under the rug and public did not get to hear or see. Jurors did not get to hear or see. And there was more than enough for my lawyers to dig up and say why was this not shown to the jurors? Why did her parents pay for a psychiatric evaluation and it was never allowed even to be entered as evidence. And so only their side of who they depicted me to be was shown to my jurors and shown to the media, shown to the public. And reading those 30 pages that day was the first time I felt like somebody finally heard me. I had a court date on April 23rd. If the judge agreed to it I would be offered a plea agreement from the prosecution for a time served sentence and lesser charges. The things the judge said he made it very clear to me that it was his decision whether or not I left that day. And he read over it and said "In the court of Indiana State versus Charity Payne "offender is to be released today." (loud bang) Just cried and broke down. I'm sure I felt every emotion that I can't even label. - Everybody knows that she is guilty and she is out on the street walking free. And my dad and Corby and Lynn are all dead. (camera clicking) - The media I just remember a lot of lights and shouting I don't think I heard any one question. I think it was more like a tunnel vision type of thing for me. When my eyes saw the other side of that door all I wanted was to be on it. I ran. I wasn't stopping to answer any questions. - It was amazing. You know I never dreamed that she would spend anytime behind bars. Then when she got out it was like life started all over again and I had her back. It was almost like the day I had her when she was born which is another whole story in itself. I didn't want anymore kids after her two brothers. And her dad's like he wanted to have another baby and I'm like I don't want another boy. I wanna have a girl if I'm gonna have one. And we prayed for a daughter. And we named her when I was four months pregnant with her. So it was kind of like that when she got out. - I think by the technically or whatever that she was released early and only served seven years of her sentence that she got a huge, huge break a break that would be the equivalent of winning the lottery. She certainly is as culpable and guilty in this as if she pulled the trigger herself. - I feel like part of the justice that was given for those men was taken away. I believe she needs to be where she's supposed to be which is locked up. I don't think she's out because she's not guilty because obviously she is. I mean she sat through the jury and the trial and the 12 people that found her guilty. She's out because somebody didn't do their job right. But I look at it like the day that she got 165 years my mother got a life sentence. And she's not gonna get off on a technicality or in this many years it's gonna be done. She's gonna have to serve her full term and so are all the other family members of all three of them. It's a forever thing with us. It is a life thing. And for Charity it's not and it should be. - So I was very angry at the police for not doing their job. I was very angry at the court system for not holding her responsible for what she did. I was angry at her lawyer. I was angry at everybody. And then I sat back and thought about it and I thought this just comes down to one person. It comes down to Charity. She still is not admitting her part in this murder. - I don't think she's sorry at all. I think she feels that she beat the system. I'm not a real religious man but I do believe in God and karma is really gonna come back and haunt her someday. I think I hate her more than I hate Phillip Stroud. I don't know if that's right or wrong but that's just my feelings. - I don't know that she could ever apologize and be forgiven. Now that being said I think probably it would still be a good idea to openly apologize about it and then they can make their decision if they're gonna forgive her or not. I think she's afraid to do that 'cause she's afraid she is admitting that it's all her fault. And I think to her it's if she admits any responsibility that's admitting I mean that she pulled the trigger. - Why say it because it'll never be enough. I'm sorry cannot do it. And until if they ever would let me show them if they would ever get to know me and if there was anything I could do by knowing them then maybe they would know I was sorry. But to say I'm sorry wouldn't cut it. (slow piano music) - I'm not just glad that she got the opportunity to get out of prison and move on with her life because Charity Payne she didn't deserve to be locked up no more than Kerel Seabrooks or Tyrone Wade deserve to be locked up for the rest of they life. I'm where I'm supposed to be because of what I did. For a long time I just thought about how it affected me and my incarceration affected me and my family but the real victims are Wayne Shumaker, Corby Meyers, and Lynn Ganger and their families that have to live with that and try to put they lives back together to this day, man. And Charity Payne was a victim. Not a victim on a level of them. I don't wanna by any means do I wanna equate that but she was a victim in her own way. I'm the only person that's not a victim. I'm not a victim at all. That's just really what I have to live with. And that's a part of my legacy and that's the worst thing that I've ever did worst thing that's ever happened in my life. (slow piano music) (thunder rumbling) - Jobs, I got a job right away and have always maintained a job. I never went without that. But that gap between 18 and 25 I missed was more more than just missing out on saving money it was building foundations and getting jobs that you can move up in pay. So I have to start at the bottom. It's really hard for me as far as a career or a certain type of job because as a child I had dreams, what I wanted to do but having a felony keeps me from certain things. I can't work for banks, any federal institutions schools, there's certain places I can't work. Period. - She just recently got hired at a retail store and I think that to some people might think that's no big deal but it is a big deal for her and it could lead to better things for her. - Think of all the changes you go through even between 18 and 25, which I think was probably about the time she was released there's a lot of growing up and maturing you do during those years. She kind of got frozen at 18 being in prison and someone making all of your decisions during that time when everybody figures out how to do it on their own. - [VOICEOVER] Alright there we. - Get get a picture. (camera clicking) - My name is Tammy and I... The relationship I had with Charity is I met her through the dog program when she was at prison in prison and from there we began to write and eventually when she left prison she moved here with us. When the neighbors found out they weren't quite so happy but - They still hate us. (woman laughing) We don't get along with our neighbors very well. - The neighbors were upset that we would bring somebody into the house who had been in prison and not tell them and so it began some conflict. I guess I was naive. I said really. I said, "Well, why don't you get to know her? "Why don't you come over?" I invited them. I said, "Come over. Let's sit. "We'll have dinner. "You'll find out. "Don't believe what you read." And absolutely not they said no. "No, we know what people like that are like" and just absolutely refused. - It effects me obviously every day but it's something that I can't let destroy me. I just like everybody else have to get up and go to work every day to make money to pay my bills in order to survive. And the only reason that I even came back to that area is because that's where my family is and that's my safety net regardless of what happened there. I don't have anywhere else to go. As much as they want me out of there it's hard. It's not easy to walk into a room and not know who hates you. (slow somber music) - The bottom line is she's going to live in our society. Do you think it's better to support people that are coming back into society or do you think it's better to shun them? Your daughters are gonna be standing next to people in the grocery store and you don't know everybody's history. So you could be standing next to her and never have any idea. Yeah, so it's been five years and that was it they really... We have neighbors who just still will not talk to us. - I sincerely hope that she thinks about the victims and their families every day of her life and she takes that and does something positive with her life now that she is out and maybe help some other people along the way or makes that a huge part of her life. That'll never make up for for what's already happened but she certainly at this point has an opportunity that most people don't ever get a second time. - People ask that all the time "How are you doing?" I mean you go on. You don't have a choice but to go on and live your life. So you go on and you enjoy life because the people that you love are still here with you but there's always just this little ache that you can feel just a little reminder that one important person's not there. And not because he died natural and not because he doesn't wanna be there but because somebody else made it that way and they took his life. - Time doesn't heal anything. The only thing that time does for you is help you to be able to get things into perspective and time helps you to be able to control yourself and your emotions but time doesn't heal anything. It's not any less of a pain today than it was 11 years ago. My mother I watched go from being one person to becoming another person and she'll never be that one person again. And I couldn't tell you for how long that she wouldn't get dressed. She wouldn't come out of her room that she had to take pills to get through the day. And that just didn't last a few weeks or a few months that's her life. - I think when you're going through a loss like this the only other people that can understand it maybe are the people that are going through it with you. Corby's girlfriend at the time was pregnant. And every time I see his little girl she looks just like Corby. My heart just skips a beat because I think that little girl will never know her dad never get to hear his voice. Never. He never got to hold her. And being my dad was the person that was killed and being a daddy's little girl I thought she'll never have that experience with her dad. - I'm thankful for for the time that he was a part of my life. A lot of life lessons from him that I will pass over to my kids who will never know him. I mean I know that you're supposed to forgive in order to move on and stuff but they also say God knows your heart so God knows that I'm not there. And I don't know that I'll ever be there. And I know that a part of him would probably want me to let it go. - I can't deny my involvement in any of it. I have to accept it and grow and learn from that too. And now I feel like even if I did good for the rest of my life you can't ever make up for the bad. I can never possibly even those family members make right for all of that wrong but for me I just have to live right and make right choices from now on and not end up that person that some people expect me to. - I can remember him... You'd get upset when people talk about you or put you down and you always have that go on growing up in school and things like that he would always say that... He would say, "Sheila, do you know what the truth is?" and obviously yes I did. He would say, "As long as you know the truth "it doesn't matter what people say. "People are always gonna talk. "There's always gonna be something. "But as long as you know in your heart "what is and what isn't "that's all that should matter." - I think it would probably be overwhelming to just even walk in the same room as them. They would already feel it. They would know that they didn't walk into the presence of something horrible or evil when they met me. They would walk in and feel the human being in me that has the remorse and everything you can attach to living with this every day every day. 'Cause it won't ever go away.
