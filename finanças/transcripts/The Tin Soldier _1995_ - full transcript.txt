(bell ringing) (gentle music) (birds chirping) (gentle music continues) (birds chirping) (dog barking) (gentle music continues) (dog barking) (birds chirping) (gentle music continues) (gentle music continues) (gentle music continues) (dog barking) (birds chirping) (gentle music continues) (birds chirping) (dog barking) (birds chirping) - I gotta go, I'm late. Good luck on your first day of school, honey. I'm sorry I can't take you. I know it's gonna be great. And don't worry, things are gonna get better. (door bangs) (birds chirping) (gentle music) (birds chirping) - [David] Hey, Riordan. - [Riordan] Yo, what's up, David? - [David] Check this out. - [Riordan] Aw, man. (chuckles) What is it? (suspenseful music) - Hey, that's that new kid. - He just moved into Roach Motel. - Where'd he get those clothes? Salvation Army? - [Riordan] Yeah, he's stupid. (suspenseful music continues) - [David] Gotcha! - [Riordan] I got you too. (David and Riordan laughing) - [David] Did you hit that fool? - [Riordan] I got him, man. (gentle music) (dog barking) (brakes screeching) (door squeaks) - Okay. Those with the blue cards, go to the 200 room. And those with the yellow cards, go the, um... Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Those with the yellow cards, go to the 200 room. Hey, you guys, you're not listening. (gentle music) - Hey, come on! Cut it out. Cut it out. Cut it out. Cut it out. All of you. (school children clamoring) Hold on. Whoa, off of him. Easy, easy, easy. (school children clamoring) (gentle music) (class chattering) (gentle music) - What do you think you're doing? It's my seat, punk. - I don't think so. Find another one. - Oh yeah? - Look, it's the first day of school, nobody is assigned seats yet. - It's gonna be your last day, punk. - Hi, Clyde? - What's up? - The seat's mine. Back off, Psycho. (class chattering) - Sure, Clyde. I hear you. Didn't know it was yours, pal. - Tough guy, ain't you? - He's not so big. (Clyde chuckles) - Well, they don't call him Psycho for nothing. - I didn't know that. - You got guts in my book, kid. What's your name? - Billy. - You're new here? - [Billy] Moved in last week. - Well, Billy boy, I think you got what it takes to be Pack 13. - Pack 13? - Yeah, my boys, my colors. - Why don't you come and hang with me? - I, I don't know. - What? What's the problem? - No problem. Uh, I just don't think I need to be in a gang. (Clyde scoff) - Yeah, right. Right, right, right. Suit yourself, tough guy. - Don't you want your chair back? (class chattering) - Nah, I can find my own. - Thanks. (class chattering) - Up. (class chattering) - Hey, you guys, settle down. Come on. We don't have much time for the... So how are you guys doing? - [Class] Good. - Did you have a good summer? Come on, I can't hear you. Did you have a good summer? - [Class] Yes. (overlapping chatter) - How are you doing, Beth? Do you all know about this guy here, he made to the state finals? Big hand. (class cheering and applauding) Clyde, so are you gonna join us for another year? - Yes, ma'am. - Well, another year isn't gonna kill any of us. Is it? I'm gonna see to it that you get it right this year. Oh, we have a new student. Let's see. You are? - Billy. Billy McCluskey. - [Teacher] Well, Billy, why don't you stand up so we can have a look at you? It says here you're from Michigan. Where in Michigan? - Mattawan. - Mattawan? Where's that? - Near Detroit. - [Teacher] Oh. Well, is there anything you'd like to tell us about yourself? Hobbies or... - No. - [Teacher] Do you have any brothers or sisters at the school? - Can I sit down, please? - Well, I'll tell you what, you answer my question, I'll think about it. - No, no brothers, no sisters, no family, just me and my mom. Can I sit down, please? - [Teacher] Yeah. Okay, people. Well, we have another new year here, and that means we start the year off with a- - [All] Clean slate. - Yeah, you got the drill. Now, some of you guys, you've been doing great. That's good. You keep up the good work. Well, why don't some of you other people look at this as a, as an opportunity to get back up there and make a change for the better? I know you have a lot on your minds. It's the first day of school so it all seems a bit overwhelming, but I really want you to know that there's always somebody here to help you. The hard part is you're just gonna have to ask for it. (bell ringing) Okay, I'll see most of you in my history class, third period. Oh, you know, by the way, the walls have been cleaned, so why don't you leave the creativity to the art class? Good luck. (spray paint hissing) (suspenseful music) - Well, well, well, it's the fresh meat. This is Snakes' territory, B. Snakes only. Don't you know nothing. You're gonna have to pay a toll. So what's he gonna be? Bills or blood? - I, I, I don't got any money. - I was hoping you would say that. (suspenseful music continues) (Billy thuds) Come on, come out. I'm not gonna hurt you. Come out, come on. (suspenseful music continues) Come on, get up. Come on. Don't make this too easy on me. Come on, don't make- - So you don't any help, huh, tough guy? - This is Snakes' territory, Clyde. You know the line. - So what you gonna make out of it, Dice? Shall we go? You had him up against the ropes, huh, tough guy? - The name's Billy. - Yeah, I know. What the hell were you doing in there anyways? - What I normally doing in a bathroom. I had to go. (Clyde chuckles) - Oh boy, do you have a lot to learn. That's the Snakes' turf, you can't go in there. - [Billy] But where am I supposed to go? - Well, with no colors, little man, home. - So how's about, uh, I take you to meet the boys after school? - Sure, I guess. - All right, guy. Meet me at the basketball courts. - Cool. (gentle music) (school children chattering) - Hey, who wants to take my place? You wanna take my place? - Oh, no. (boy speaking faintly) (gentle music continues) - Hi, Billy! Hi, I'm Toni. - Hi. - Well, welcome to Central Middle School. It's okay. I know how you feel. I was the new kid on the block last year. This place looks tough, but you'll get the hang of it. - I hope so. - Well... Well, some of my friends are... Well, well, some of my friends are, uh... Some of my friends are forming a committee for the kick of it. Do you wanna come over to my house and help out? - A party, Toni? Me and the boys, we'd love to. - Don't even dream about it, scuzz! He a friend of yours? - What- - To the end, Toni. (school children chattering) - That's too bad. - What are you tryna do to me? - Hey, who, tiger. Down, boy, down. Just trying to save you from a lifetime of misery and pain. - I can make my own decisions, okay? (Clyde scoff) - Now, why on earth would I let you do something like that? You'll cheer up once you meet my boys. - [Bill] I know about colors and stuff, from my dad. - Ah, you're smarter than to listen to all that parental bull, ain't you? - No, I mean, you don't understand- - 'Cause, you know, all that crap that they tell you is whacked. I mean, "Our babies are getting murdered in the streets. They're drug runners." Drug runners, can you believe that? And then they run to their precious booze and pills. Hypocrites, all of them. You know, the only place you can get respect is on the streets; and if you don't have it, you don't have anything. - Hey, it's mama's boy. - Yeah, that's the dork from Detroit. - [Clyde] Hey, this is Billy. He wants to be in the Pack. - What, man? - No, way, Clyde. - Hey, I'm a big dog here, and I vote we take him in. - On a trial basis, Clyde. Hey, we don't know if this kid can hang. - [Riordan] Yeah, man - On the trial basis then, okay? - Yeah. 'Cause if he can't run with the wild dogs, (gang barking) stay on the porch. So we gots to be cool. (suspenseful music) - It's okay, Clyde. I mean, it's not that important. - Hey, just say the word, Billy boy, and we'll jump you in. Come here. You'll be part of a family. We'll always be there for you. - Trial basis- - Hey, check this out. We own everything from the middle of that bridge to Avenue A. - Own? - Oh yeah. It's more like a lease. - From who? - From them. (funky music) (suspenseful music) They're real. (suspenseful music continues) That's gonna be me someday, you know? It just takes time. - Ey, yo, Clyde! The Snakes, man. The Snakes, they got Slick in Beebo. Yo, man! Come on, man, come on! - Hey, you're not gonna wanna miss this. Let's get 'em! (gang members clamoring) You see that line? We're in Snake's territory now. (dramatic music) - [Boy] You're gonna get it now. (dramatic music continues) - Stay back, Billy! Let him go! (dramatic music continues) - [Group] Let's get them. Come on. (dramatic music) - Well, well, well look who's here. - Hey now, don't be afraid. Stand your ground. (siren ringing) - Break it up. Break it up. - I'm gonna get you, punk. - You know where to find me. - You've been warned before. This area is off limit. (siren wailing) - Hey, let's get him. There he goes! (dramatic music) (table clattering) (dramatic music continues) (Mr. Fallon screaming) - Get outta my store! - Easy, easy. I'm leaving, okay? - [Mr. Fallon] Leave! - I'm going. - Go! Go on! They're getting younger all the time. (sighs) Oh look at this. Look at this. Oh, look at this. (table clattering) Oh. Oh. All right. All right. Okay. Oh. (table clattering) Oh, look at this. Okay, let me sit. Okay. What a mess. What a mess. What's this? Who are you? Oh, yeah, I know, I recognize you by your wheels. Look at this. Two horses and no place to go. Okay. Here's a wagon. Oh, that's Margaret Mouse. You straight is way the heck up. Okay. Take it easy. Where's Rocco? Oh, Rocco, how are you feeling? 'Cause if somebody pulled my ear off, I'd... Why am I talking to you? You can't even hear me. I said I'd feel the same way if somebody ripped my ear off. (Mr. Fallon sighs) Everybody calm down. Everybody calm down because this has happened before. And I'm gonna fix your good as new, don't worry about it. I just gotta find the glue. Hello? - Huh? - Hello? Is there something you want? Can I help you with anything? - No, no, no sir. - Oh, oh, you're browsing? - Y, y, yeah, yes, sir. - Well, I'm not sure, but I think if you stood up, you do better browsing 'cause now you're browsing low. You see, everything you see is from here down. You, you're missing everything from here up. I'm not sure, I could be wrong. She's pretty, huh? Dance ballerina. (gentle music) - I, i, is, is this supposed to be a toy store? - It's not supposed to be a... It is a toy shop. - Well, well, well then where's the Game Boy and the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers? - Who left you in charge of what's a good toy and what's a bad toy? - I know what's fun. - Oh, you know, what's fun? Like those hoodlums that chased you in, yeah, that was fun. No, we don't have toys that do that. That purple and green boy, what does he want with you? - Well, there's a fight in the lot down the street. - A fight? You lied to me? You mean you're one of them? You're a hoodlum. - Well, I'm, I'm, I'm not a hoodlum. Well, you see, it, it's my friend Clyde. Well, he's not really... Well... - What? What? What? - It was the first day of school and I just wanted to join the Science Club, honest. - The Science Club? Yeah, that happened to me one time. Excuse me. Being a member of a group. Ah, but you have to ask yourself the question: Where's my integrity? Where's my moral strength? Where's my honesty? - I must have left 'em in Detroit. (Mr. Fallon laughing) - Detroit? So that means, so that means you're new to the neighborhood, huh? (Mr. Fallon laughing) What's your name? - Billy. - That is absolutely correct. (metal rattling) (Mr. Fallon whistling) Ringa-linga-ling. - [Billy] What's that? - Oh, that is a puzzle. Isn't that wonderful? Look at it. See the ring? You have to get the ring off of these horseshoe. Ah. - But that, that's impossible. I mean, the ring's not big enough to go around the horseshoes, unless there's a break in it. - Yes, it is the way... So you think... What are you trying to tell me? You think that the answers to the puzzle is that there's a crack in it? No. No, no, no, no. It's not because there's a crack in it, that would be a silly puzzle. If you say the, the, the solution is that there's a crack. Okay. - But if you could freeze the horseshoe, then, they they contract. - No, no, no. This puzzle is done at room temperature. - Yeah, it's impossible. - Well, impossible things are happening every day. Hey, hey, hey. (metal rattling) Ta-da! - How'd you do that? - Well, (chuckles) lucky, I guess. But problems are made to be solved. Like you, a scientific boy like you, you say things like, "Well, this is an old toy shop," you're not interested. I love science. I love it. Science is a great subject, It's my favorite subject. I'll tell you the truth. I love everything about science, everything, and interestingly... Oh, it's a hot subject. You know what I'm talking about? (laughing) Okay, look, I'm gonna, I'm gonna tell you that I got something for you right in here, something that's really beautiful. Ta-da! Gently, gently. Okay. I have something for you. Hi. Okay. Okay. Easy does it. Easy does it? Yes. Okay. Attention. Yes, here we go. Okay. Okay. Gentle and beautiful. Look at that. Oh, that's lovely. Right here. Beautiful. Yes. Yes, Sarah, thank you for waiting. Oh, look at that. Look at that. Yes. (Mr. Fallon chuckles) And there's his cigar. How about that? - They're old. - They're antiques. And they are old, as are principles they represent: honesty, courage, integrity. This woman started colleges, universities for people. They all influenced lives. - Yeah. Yeah. I, I'm sure the planet that you come from, these things mean something; but here on earth, I need something different. - No, I know what you need. You need a little respect. Respect is what you need. Yes. - What I need is a bulletproof vest. - A bulletproof vest? Is that what you want? A bulletproof vest? All right. I've got something just as good right here. Have him back very soon. All right, here you are. This is for you. - A doll? - A royal knight in shining armor. And the coast is clear, so you better go home. Maybe both of you will learn something. - Both? - Well, there's you and there's him. - You're nuts, huh? - Well, the jury's still out. (chuckles) Take care, Billy. (bell jingles) Take care. (bell jingles) (gentle music) - Mom, I'm home! Mom? Mom? (gentle music continues) (door bangs) You know that girl at school today, she's kinda cute, huh? She doesn't like me. She's nice, though. Of course she's probably nice to everybody. You know, she's one of those nice people. Nice people don't like people like me. I just wish this past year just never happened. I mean, I just wish you could just stop time and live the good parts and fast forward through the bad parts. You, you, you don't know time. You just, you just sit on the shelf all day. You're lucky you don't have to worry about anything but looking good and being dusted. That's the life. (insects chirping) (dog barking) - Billy? Honey, what are you still doing up? Do you know what time it is? - Astronomy project. - Aye-yi-yi. Look at this. This is a mess. You have a homework on your first day of school? No, it's not due till November. I just thought I'd get a headstart. - My kitchen knife. Right. Good boy. - I met some kids at school today. - God, I'm so exhausted. That was my third double shift in four days, my feet are killing me. (sighs) I gotta take a bath. - Yeah, they really liked me. - What, honey? - Nothing. - Okay. - Goodnight. I love you too. (objects clattering) - Billy? Billy. (somber music) (mysterious music) - [Yarik] Ow. (groans) Blasted leg. Oh. (groaning) (suspenseful music) Look at this. It's a bloody catastrophe. (muttering) (suspenseful music) When I catch up to the rotten rascal. (knight groaning) Where are you, traitor? You can't escape, I'll pursue you to the ends of the earth. (groans) (suspenseful music) Hi Jove, you're but a pup, hardly a squire of of worth by anyone's measure. - What do you want? - What were you thinking, lad? Look at me leg? This is not gonna make an impossible task any easier. Are you sure it is you who, who's needing me service? Oh, oh, oh. Oh! (armor clattering) (suspenseful music) - Mom! - Shh, shh, shh. - What do you want? - I, I believe, pup, that is for you to tell me. - Who are you? - I'm known as Yarik, knight of the Order of Fallon. And so it seems, by your command, young squire, I'm again with an injury. It gives me the chills. (groaning) - Mom! - Why me, dear Lord? What can I make of this? - What's a better? What is it? - Right there, look! - She can't see me, lad. You're the only one who can see me. - Sweetie, you're dreaming. - [Yarik] Oh, me leg. - Wake up. - I'm not dreaming! Right there, he's standing right there! - A bit tender. - Wake up, sweetie, you're still asleep. - Go away! - Haven't you caused enough trouble for one night? - Billy, you're still sleeping. - Does it look like I'm sleeping to you? There's a man in armor standing at the foot of my bed! - Stop bouncing around. I told you she can't see me. - [Mom] Billy, sit down. - You're the only one. - [Mom] Sit down! - Ah, let's, let's see what I got here on the old appendage. - Honey, you're dreaming. (armor squeaking) (Yarik humming) You're all right now. - [Yarik] Very good. Here, there we go. - Yeah, I'm fine. - Me leg's perfect. (armor clattering) - You see the reflection over there, from the fish tank? That's all it was. I'm gonna tuck you in. Come on. I know things have been tough on you 'cause of your father and the move and on. You had a nightmare. I'm sorry. Honey, sleep tight and I'll see you in the morning. - Okay. But... - You're all right now, aren't you? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Okay. Good. Good night, son. - Night. (Billy sighs) (suspenseful music) - That's enough of that, lad. No sense making all three of us upset, now, is there? (Yarik groaning) (armor squeaking) The leg won't seem to hold its place. Do you have something I could tie it off with? A brace of some kind. Oh. - What do you want? - I told you before, lad, that is entirely your decision. I was summoned; at extreme urgency, I might add; by you. - I did not. - I was more than surprised meself to be called at such an ungodly hour. But such as it is my duty to serve, alas, here I am. Don't try me patience now. Let's see how this is going to work out. (armor squeaking) Oh, this won't work at all. - This is ridiculous. I'm going outta my mind. - Oh, I wouldn't laugh if I were you. It's all your fault after all. - My fault? - Well, who do you think threw me against the wall? - What? (objects clattering) Where is that tin knight? - At this moment, he's limping down the stairwell. - You expect me to believe that you're the tin knight? - Actually, Bill, your belief is a little consequence. I'm here until the task is completed, whether you like it or not. - What are you talking about? - I'm here to help you. - Help me? - Well, (chuckles) perhaps it's time to go over a few of the basics. As a knight, as a knight of the Order of Fallon, I'm bound by honored to appear in service wherever the need is greatest and the subject is worthiest. - Worthiest? Me? - Your concerns mirror me own, lad, but that is the oath I swore and the life I choose. So I'm imagining that if you're not the worthies of squires, your need must be especially great. - I don't need anything from you. - Oh, you don't? - Where do you come from anyway? - Well, without getting too technical, which I couldn't anyway, I'm simply, I'm from, I'm from there. You know? I'm from there. - Where? - Well there, you know? I mean, you can call it the other side, the magical plane, the other realm. But it all boils down to the same thing. I am stuck here. I can't get back there until I assist you with your task. - [Billy] You're wasting your time. I don't need help from you or from anybody. - Well, I wouldn't mind getting back just as quickly as I can. I have a lady waiting. - So just go. - I can't go until your hour of need is past. So if you'll just think of something quick, I'll be gone from here and back in the arms of my beautiful ballerina. - Ballerina? - The fair Katrina. She's quite majestic, you know? And so light. Her hands, graceful beyond words, really,. You know, she's a ballerina. We were in the middle of a glorious dance when you called. - Well, it's all too overwhelming for me. I've got to sleep on it. - How can you sleep at a time like this? - I'm sure this is all just one big dream. - Let's, let's talk about this now, shall we? - You're here to do what I say, right? - Well, more or less. - Good! Then let me go to sleep. - But what of the task, the adventure I was summoned to assist you with? - Adventure? If I can get through school tomorrow without being killed, it's adventure enough for me. I mean, you have to admit, this is just a pretty hard story to swallow during the morning. So just let me get some sleep. (birds chirping) - Up and at 'em, boyo! Time's are wasting. - Oh no. - [Mom] Did you get all that stuff cleaned up off the floor? (paper rustles and thuds) - Yeah. - That's the way you clean up? - And look, there's a paint stain right there? - This is the way you clean up? - Oh, this is glorious, simply marvelous. - Look at this paint stain. It's not gonna come off my table. - Mom, feel my head. Do I have a fever? (mom sighs) - Cool as a cucumber. - Cool as cucumber. - What, you don't wanna go to school all of a sudden? Was this homework due for school? Is that what this is? - No, I told it's not due till November. All right. Good. Well, you're going to school. - Oh, he's a good looking chap. You have his eyes. - It's my dad. - What did you say? - You think dad was anything like me when he was my age? (pensive music) - No. No, you're nothing like your father. You're gonna make something outta your life. No, get dressed, eat up, and brush your teeth. (pensive music) - Yeah. Yeah. I'm going. Brush my teeth. (pensive music continues) - [Teacher] Back then when Columbus sailed this little ship. I mean, now, of course, there's travel by plane, train, cars. But back then, this was it, this was- - I'm certain that my leg will heal up as we approach the true task. What do you really think it is, really? - Shut up! Just stop talking! - I wasn't talking to you. - [Teacher] It'd be an interesting thing for us to- - I'll shut up if that's what you. I'll button my lip. Mum's the word if that's what you want. - Pretty fascinating. Can you imagine what it was like to sail a ship the size of this classroom across the ocean? Now, who knows where Columbus was really headed when he discovered the New World? - Angie. - India. - Right. And that's why till this very day we call the Native people Indians. - Of course they don't like being called Indians, they'd rather be called Native Americans or original people. - [Teacher] We all know that historians credit Christopher Columbus with discovering America. - It seems to me there was already people living here at the time, and they discovered Columbus. - But it's actually been revealed that he landed where? Class? Clyde, where did Columbus really land? If I know that sauce hound, it was probably somewhere near plenty of cheap women and cheap scotch. - Knock it off! - [Teacher] Billy, you have the answer for us, right? Stand up. - You might wanna tell San Salvador, The Bahamas. Of course Columbus was sleeping off a wicked case of the cabin spins when they reach land, and never actually saw a thing. - Billy? - Um... - It's San Salvador, lad. - San Salvador. - [Teacher] Great, that's it? - Yeah! My boy's right. Yeah, he got that just fast. Yeah! - Yes, he did. That's great. Clyde, why don't you just sit down, okay? - Oh yeah. Just you know? - Okay. Well, now Columbus' ambition was to sail to the far east. See, in the 15th century, everybody thought the world was flat, but you see today- - Thank you. - [Teacher] We know different. Today everybody knows the world's a globe. - You're welcome. (gentle music) (school children chattering) Surely I wasn't sent all this way merely to be a history tutor, but I've racked me brains and still come up with nothing. No wizards to battle, no dragons to fight, what in the name of heaven you need help with? (school children chattering) What is it, lad? (school children chattering) - Toni. (gentle music continues) - Hey Toni, what happened? (boy speaking faintly) - Yes, of course, it's always a woman. Katrina, me darling, we're almost home. My leg feels better already. Go to her, lad. Let's join her for a repast. - She thinks I'm slime. - Well, these things change. - She even hates my friends. - Good friends are hard to find. If you have one friend, hold him with bands of steel. Shakespeare said that. (school children chattering) Look at this, fella. He has this job, another on the weekend. His parents left home, he's the sole support of his younger brother and sister. He has great character, he'd make a fine friend. Now, here's a giant fellow athlete an scholar. Someday he'll play a little professional basketball, but he'll invest wisely. Quite serious about his business class, don't you know? Now, these two fellas have a wonderful and cheerful outlook on life, which may very well be the finest aspect of all. So what do you think? - I don't know. - The important thing is to choose your friends and don't let them choose you. (school children chattering) Why don't you just go and talk to her, lad? - No way! I, I can't even breathe around her. I can't even talk to her. - Oh. - Did you ever get that feeling just by looking at a girl, it makes you wanna puke your guts up? - Well- - I mean, not, not like, like sick kind of puking, but kind of like if you never saw her again that you, you'd die; but just by looking at her, it makes you sick to your stomach, kind of. - And your hands get all sweaty? - [Billy] Yeah. - And your heart beats faster? - Pounds. - That's love. I'm on my way, Katrina, me darling. No. (chuckles) Laddie, do you trust me? - I don't know. - Well, I have a plan. (school children chattering) Billy, can I have a word with you? (school children chattering) This wasn't part of the plan. - Look, there's no way I can concentrate with you buzzing around me all the time. - But she can't see me, lad - But I can. - How will my leg ever recover? - Okay, here she comes. - Just repeat me words, you'll do fine. I hope you appreciate what I'm going through. (locker slams) - [Billy] Uh... (clears throat) - Yes? - Uh... (locker bangs) - [Yarik] I'm very pleased to see you again, me lady. - I'm I'm very pleased to see you again, Toni. - Where's your buddy Clyde? - [Yarik] It is hard for me to see anything else when beauty such as yourself is present. - Well, he's not my friend. I, I don't know what he wanted. - [Yarik] I didn't say that. - Cool it. - Excuse me? - I'm truly sorry if my accent has caused you concern, fair maiden. - I'm sorry for what I said. What did I say? - [Yarik] I'm truly sorry. - Are you okay? - [Yarik] For my only intentions are to follow your wishes in the hopes of one fine day in the not too distant future, when I might find a bonding of such a- - Excuse me. - Both our souls singing like nightingales under the brightest moon might join together. - Excuse me, Shakespeare. Are you trying to help me or what? - Oh. - Speak English. - I was... - I'm sorry. - [Yarik] I'm a jerk. - I'm a jerk. I, I guess I, I was a jerk, but I, I really don't hang out with those guys. I, I just met 'em. - [Yarik] I would take the greatest of pleasures in escorting you to the joust some evening. - You wanna see a movie sometime? - Sure. That'd be great. - Hey, Billy boy, there's my number one. I got big plans for you today. - Not friends, huh? - No, Toni, we're dance partners. What's the matter, Toni? You don't wanna dance with me? What, are you afraid of men? - You're always trying to show how strong and tough you are, but all you're showing is how weak and stupid you are! - Well, I'm weak? - You wanna know what strength is, it's like my dad: to get a job, to be able to take care of us; even when he has hard times, not to give up. That's what strength is, not scaring people. - You know she's crazy about both of us, don't you? (Billy chuckles) Well, forget about her. Friends are what counts. Now, don't say a word. Here. I know you haven't been jumped in yet, but, um, I want you to have this. The boys want you in. - Really? - Yeah, it's a big deal. Come on. - Clyde, I don't know if this is such a good idea. - Thank me later. Come on. - Clyde. - What? What, you got a date or something? Come on! - [Yarik] Billy. Billy? - Woo. I thought I missed the bus. - No. (engine droning) - Hi. - Hey. - You want some coffee? - No. - I don't wanna spill it before I get on the bus. Ah, where are my cigarettes. You want a cigarette? - No thanks. - Mm. Pickle? Eh, high in salt. It's the first time I've seen you smile since you've started at the diner. - I have a lot on my mind. - Don't we all? I know it's not easy, a single mom raising a kid all on her own. It's a small diner, people talk. Besides, we're all in the same boat. I mean, I have two of my own. Listen, if you ever wanna talk, I'm here. I don't gossip. So what happened? I mean, was he in bed with everybody? What, was he sleeping around wit everybody and then you throw him out? Is that what happened? Was he a wife beater? Is that it? He beat you? I don't know what... Why do we always love the ones who hurt us the most? I don't know. Is it, is it women? I mean, we love them, we leave them. We love them, we go back to them. It's our own fault, I guess, it's women. Well, at least I got you to smile. You have a nice smile. (pensive music) - I'm just worried about my kid. (suspenseful music) - I got a bad feeling about this. - What, are you chicken? - No. - Come on. It's just a couple cans of spray paint. Besides, who's gonna gonna miss 'em? You're one of us now. - Come on, Billy. Time to earn that jacket. (vehicles droning) (door creeks and slams) - Can I help you, son? - No, no, sir. No. No, thank you. - [Yarik] Isn't that jacket just smashing, Billy? They'll love it in juvenile hall. If you really want to impress him, why not take two? Or three. Or four. Her, have another, have another, Billy. Look, why don't you take the whole lot? That's, that's sure to impress the lad. - Hey, what's going on here, huh? What's going on, big guy? - The, uh, dis, display fell over. - Oh, the display fell over. Well, you know, that stuff happens sometimes. Well, do you think you can put these back where they were? - Y, yes, sir. - You think you can put 'em back exactly where they were? - Yes, yes, sir. - How about you give it a try. Go ahead. (cans clattering) - What's taking so long, man? We thought you were caught. - This is stupid. I'm not going through with it. - All right. Don't worry about it, little buddy. You'll get another chance. Let's get outta here, man. - Hey. (whistles) You an artist, homes? - No. - No? Then why do you need this, huh? - Uh, I- - Yeah. - I, I didn't- - You know what? I've had enough of you guys. Now you're gonna wait in the back with me while I call your parents. Let's go. - Well, he did something really bad, huh, Mom? - Unreal. Come here, don't stare. You're right, that was bad. You should never do something like that. - What did you think was gonna happen? What? I'm talking to you! What were you even thinking of? - Listen to me. I said I didn't do it. - I don't wanna talk about this anymore. Go to your room. - If Dad were here, he'd understand. (birds chirping) (pensive music) - Ah, come on, Billy. It was a joke. You know, Riordan's always pulling the stunts like that. - Yeah, it was like a test of merit, you know? - It wasn't very funny. - Hey! Get 'em! - Billy, come on! Hurry up! - I've seen their kind before. You stay in their company, I predict nothing but bad times ahead. - Well, you're in a gang. - Are you a daft, boy? - No. I mean, the knight of Order of... Well, something, whatever you call it. - Of Fallon. And I'd hardly call it a gang. - Well, what would you call it then? A bunch of guys hanging out in their castle? You all wear the same clothes, and you're all friends, and you always have somebody to watch your back. - We're bound by honor, a spirit of purpose, a vow to help those in need, not steal, terrorize and destroy. If you wanna belong to something, why not make it your own family? - [Billy] I don't have a family. - [Yarik] You have a mother who loves you. - [Billy] Yeah. Well, she sure does have a funny way of showing it. - [Yarik] You have a lot to learn about love. - Yeah, well, I don't do anything with her and she doesn't do anything with me. These are the only friends I have. - Well, it seems to me you don't have any real friends now, but you certainly could. You're a bright chap, and sometimes bright good company when you're not whining and feeling sorry for yourself. - [Dice] Help! Somebody! - Do you hear that? - What? - [Dice] Help! (yelling faintly) - Over here. - [Dice] Help! Help, I'm stuck! - Do you hear that? You hear that, lad? - What? - [Yarik]] Come here, lad. Quickly. - [Dice] Please, somebody! - [Yarik] Look. See? Down there, down there. You see him? - Help me, please! - He's in trouble. Hello? - Ace, is that you? - Let's get some help. - I'm afraid there's no time, Billy. - [Ace] Hey! - We can do this. - Are you nuts? I'm not going down there for a kid that would just as soon kill me. - Billy, there's no time to get help. That boy's life is in your hands. It's all up to you. - [Dice] Help! Somebody, please! Ace! Somebody please help me! Somebody! - Hang on, man, I'm coming. - [Dice] Hurry, man! Hurry! (suspenseful music) Please, I'm slipping. - Yarik? - What is it, lad? - How's that leg feeling? - Oh, it's getting better by the minute. Keep at it, lad. (Dice yelling faintly) - [Dice] Come on! (suspenseful music continues) Hurry up! Help me out! (suspenseful music continues) I can't get my leg up! (Dice yelling faintly) (suspenseful music continues) (Dice yelling faintly) My arm is weak. Grab this arm. Grab this part right here. (Dice speaking faintly) - [Billy] I got you. Swing it up. - [Dice] Grab, grab it. (straining) Grab it. Come on. - Okay. Uh, uh... - Come on, man. Do something. - All right, see this? See this? This is the controller. We're gonna go up. Can you hang on? - I'm just trying to hold on. - Okay. We're going up. Here we go. - Get us outta here, man. (motor whirring) (motor clanks) Oh, man, what's wrong? (suspenseful music) - Okay. - [Dice] Man, you gotta do something. - Now what, dragon slayer? We're stuck! - [Dice] Who are you calling to? - Uh, it's, it's my guard angel. Just, just, don't worry about it, okay? - Guardian angel? That's fine with me. - [Yarik] If you can't climb up, climb down. - If we can't climb up, let's climb down. You can do that, can't you? - [Dice] Yeah, I can do that. - [Billy] You can do it. I'll go first. (suspenseful music) You know, you can follow me. Don't be afraid. You can do it. Okay? If you need support, then use my shoulders. And don't look down. - All right. Hey, man. - What? Ow. - With our colors and all, you could have just... Hey, thanks. Be careful. - You too. (suspenseful music) (Dice straining) Okay. Put your foot on my shoulders. - [Dice] All right. Where is it? (Billy straining) - [Billy] Okay. Here we go. You're doing fine! - [Dice] How are you doing? - [Billy] What? - [Dice] How are you doing? - [Billy] You're fine. How are you holding up? - [Dice] Fine. Are we there yet? - [Billy] We're almost there. - [Dice] Ow! Sorry. - [Billy] It's okay. It's okay. I'm okay. Are you okay? - [Dice] Yeah. - [Billy] Okay. We're here. Where are we? - [Boy] Don't worry, homie. We in my territory now. - Hey, Dice. - Don't worry, you say? - Relax. I'm gonna take care of you. - Pack rat, get him! - [Boy] Oh, yeah, little Billy, Billy. Let's get him. - Yeah, get that- - Ey, yo, hold up, man. - Hey, move it, Dice! Move it! Look what they did to Psycho. (suspenseful music) - You, man, he saved my life. I owe him, Ace. - So do we. - Hey, back up, back up. He saved Dice's life, man. I guess we gotta put it up to honor. - Honor? - What about my honor? - Stop, man! (suspenseful music) Well, hero, you saved Dice's life. You can say that gets you somewhere, so he won't toss you up today. But you still owe us for what they did to Psycho. - [Psycho] That's right, Ace. - Look, I'm not part of their gang. - Ey, man, you travel with them and you wear their colors, that makes you one of them. (suspenseful music) Listen, man, the Snakes demand a fight of honor. You've got one day slide period. At the old warehouse tomorrow afternoon, you and Psycho one on one. Now get outta here before I change my mind! - I ain't waiting for tomorrow. - Hey, Psycho! (dog snarling) - Tomorrow at the old warehouse! You're mine, punk! - Hot dog! Bravissimo! That was some rescue, boyo. Magnificent. - Nice of you to pop in now. I thought your leg healed and you split. - Well, unfortunately for me, you're still in need me services. - Can I ask you a question? - Anything you like, lad. - How come the only time I ever even need you, you're know where to be found. - But you pulled through, rescued the boy, didn't you? - Yeah. And 20 kids back there still wanna kill me. Thanks for everything. - Are you being sarcastic? - No. - What would you have me do, lad? - I don't know. Something. Anything. What happened to your wish is my command? - I think you got your stories confused. I'm a knight, not a genie. - I'm going to be killed. - Don't worry. I've seen the fire in your spirit, lad. Going over the edge of that bridge, 'twas a brave deed. - I've never thrown a punch in my life. I'm going to be slaughtered. - Is that all you're worried about, the fight? - No, Yarik. I'm afraid of dying too. - By Jove! It's all come to me now. The fates have sent me here now to guide the young squire along the path of the warrior. I'm going to teach you how to fight, (birds chirping) to stand up for your honor. You see? Come on. Come on. Come on. See? Now, what are you gonna do? What are you gonna do? Come on at me. Come on! Oh boy. Now, you see, you see? And that's with my bad leg too. You see what I used is your own energy against you, that's like reverse force. That's a very good strategy for a scientific fella like yourself. - How about we not fight at all? That's a good strategy. - Lad, it's a valuable thing, your life. It's about about time you learn to defend it. Now get up. I'm gonna show you a punch. Boom! Right in the chest. You hit him right here, see? Lots of people think in the stomach, but it's not true. Right there and he'll go (gasping) and you'll the tide of the fight. Now lets, let's try it here. Hit me right in the chest. That's how far you have to be, it's from your nose to my chest. You see? - I can never get that close to him. - Let's talk about defense. Try to hit me. Try to hit me. Come on, try to hit me. Try to hit me again. Come on. Right here in the chin. Can't you hit me? Ah, you see, you can't hit me. Why? Because I'm using the old pyramid. The pyramid, you put your hands together; and when he takes the swing right from here, you are gonna move right with him. See? Like that. Again. Go ahead, again. And then you can do anything you want with him, you see? 'Cause he's so confused. - I quit! - Lad, you can't quit. Your honor's at the stake. And even if you are beaten to a bloody pulp, you can sleep with the peace that you fought a man's fight for his own dignity. - Spoken like a man who's never been beat up before. - On the contrary. Billy, I'm a warrior. And if it's not the path for you to take, it's the only one I know. But- - [Billy] But? - But are you prepared to walk away from the testament knowing that you never even tried? - But the guy's three times my size. - Men are only small in cowardice. (Yarik groans) Yeah. Got your pride, didn't it? Got your pride. Well, you see that? Pride is a good thing too. Pride is a very important aspect, nope? You're a very aggressive fella, very aggressive. I'll have to use every... Where are ya? I'll have to use everything in my power to sustain my survival with you. I can see that right now. Now I'm coming at you. I'm angry, you see? You threw me down a couple of times. Here I come. Watch out! (both groan) You've done it, lad. You've done it! You realize that. I got a tiger on my hands. Back off, you brute. Climb up against it. Now, but I still have a trick at all to throw at you. Up here, you dangerous creature. (uplifting music) You know, you just about whipped me, lad. I think you're, you're the man of the day. (Yarik laughing) That's, that's enough. - [Billy] Come on. Come on. - [Yarik] That's enough, lad. Oh, well, we've covered a lot of ground in a short period of time, and we both seemed to have survived it. - [Billy] I just hope I can remember it all. - As you feel the cause is pure, (gentle music) you feel the righteousness of it; that gives you your memory. Oh, nice going, lad. (Yarik sighs) Look at me leg. Lad, look. It's holding. Look, look, look. Look. I'm telling you, you keep moving like this, I'll be gone before you know it. Look. - You'll be gone? - Yes, of course. Home, lad. Katrina's been waiting long enough, don't you think? (chuckles) - But- - You're some fighter, Billy. I tell ya. Look, my quest is all but done. Look, look at this. - What if I need you again? I mean, you can't go. - Oh, I must, son. - You're not my father, don't call me that! - Billy. - You, you're all the same. You say you're here to help me, and then, and then you leave when I need you. Just like my mom, she's trying to leave too. I just wish you'd go home now. (Billy sniffling) Why, Yarik? I mean, why do you have to go too? - Oh, it's not up to me, lad. (Billy sniffling) - But you taught me to do things, to, to be brave and to be a man, like you're my father, and now you're leaving too. - Oh, laddie. How much you must be hiding under all these tears. My time here is but a short while, just enough to ease you on your way through the season of testament. As flattered as I am, I wish to God I could have a son such as yourself. You're right, I'm not your father. (somber music) - The only ones that really want me are Pack 13. - Those misguided wasted childhood? I think not. They only need you to make them feel important. You are the life, me boy. It's time you started living it. (somber music continues) How long can the two of you sit in silence. (cutlery clatters) - Finished? - I guess. Just like I said, she's already gone. - If you don't mind my asking, how long has she been like this? - Ever since my father died. In a lot of ways, it's better this way. - Rubbish. Family should do things together, talk things out. - I don't need advice from you. Now I'm going to bed. I've gotta fight for my honor tomorrow, thanks to you. (pensive music) (window squeaks) (insects chirping) - Couldn't sleep, laddie? - I'm sorry about what I said. - Oh, well, you have a lot on your mind. Just remember what I said. Keep your heart true, your conviction's strong, and you'll do just fine. I'm very proud of you, laddie - Thinking about Katrina? - Mm. Am I so easy to read? (Billy chuckles) - I'm learning. - That you are, laddie, that you are. - You miss her, huh? - With all my heart and with all my soul. - Yeah. Well, if you're half as good a teacher as you say you are, you'll be with her tomorrow. I'll try to get some sleep. I'm gonna need all the help I can get. - Good night, laddie. - Night, Yarik. (window squeaks) (insects chirping) (school children chattering) What's that on your head? - This is me lucky hat. - It's not a hat. - It is. I'll have you know, this hat has yet to fail me in battle. Would you like the word it for luck? - Are you out of your mind? - You don't like it? - I hate it. - You don't. (chuckles) - I do. - Ah, Billy, tell me you like me hat. - Get away from me. - Oh, here comes trouble. Tell him to cast off, we can handle the scrape alone. I mean, together, you know, but without him. - Hey, Billy boy. Where's your colors? - I left them at home. - Well, we can't worry about that. We got other things to go over. Those Snakes are going to learn a lesson the hard way. You are just the warmup today, pal . And after the pre-show, the real battle begins. (suspenseful music) - What are you talking about? - We've been trying to get those Snakes into a face to face for a long time now, and you set them up perfectly. (suspenseful music) - I thought this was a fight about honor, not a gang war. - Stop living in a fantasy world. As soon as one of you go down, we move in. We couldn't have done it without your, buddy. We'll see you there. (suspenseful music) - Good luck. (suspenseful music) - Billy, you prepared well and were bravely set to the testament, but now you must bow out. - But what about my honor? - This isn't about honor, it has nothing to do with honor. You mustn't be a part of it now. - Then you'll never get back. - Even if it meant I would never return, even if that's what it meant, I couldn't let you do it and I won't. - I don't know what I need to do, Yarik, but I need to be there. - Billy, if you make this decision, you'll be alone. There isn't any way on earth I can help you. (suspenseful music) Billy! (suspenseful music continues) - Billy! Is it true that you're gonna be in a gang fight? - [Billy] Who told you? - Everyone's talking. It's not true, is it? - [Billy] Yeah, it, it's true. - But you're not like them. You're kind and gentle. I know you're a good person. Please don't do this. - [Billy] My father said once, "You can't walk away from a challenge." I have to go. - But I'm scared for you. - I'm scared too. (sighs) Why am I telling you this, you of all people? - Because you know I care. Can I do anything to stop you? There must be something I can do. - Maybe say a prayer? - Billy, be careful. (pensive music) (door slams) (suspenseful music) - This isn't right, Clyde. You said a fair fight. I can't go through with this. - Don't do this to me, Billy. - What are you guys doing here? You can't come in. - We can't come in? - We have to. - Man, hide in the back. Be quiet. - What the hell do you think those Snakes are gonna to you anyways, huh? Psycho there is gonna cut you up into little pieces. - You gotta take him quick, Psycho. - Do it. - Yo, Clyde, no weapons, no interference, don't touch my- - Yeah, we know the rules. - Let's get it on then. (suspenseful music) - Purple and green. - Gold! - [Gang Members] War! - Now's the time, lad, the breath stopper. - Psycho, we can call this off. - I want you, fool. (gang members clamoring) You're not gonna fight at all, are you? (Billy thuds) (gang members clamoring) - The pyramid, the... (gang members clamoring) That's it. (gang members clamoring) - [Gang Member] Come on, fight! (gang members clamoring) - [Gang Member] Come on, Psycho! (gang members clamoring) - Move! - [Ace] Hey, I told you not to touch him, Clyde. - [Clyde] Yeah, right. - [Ace] That ain't the way we do it. - [Clyde] What, Ace? I ain't doing nothing. - Hey, you crossed the line. - Yeah, sure. We owe you one. Go ahead. - Reverse. Reverse force. (gang members clamoring) That's a new one. We'll call it the cannon ball. (gang members clamoring) (punch thuds) (gang members clamoring) Pyramid. (punch thuds) (Billy groans) Oops. (Psycho and Billy straining) - Ah, you bit me, man. What are you? An animal? - [Billy] Yes. (gang members clamoring) (Psycho gasps) - That's it. - That was my breath stopper. - Psycho, Psycho, take the stick. - Here, take this. (gang members clamoring) (chain rattles) (gang members clamoring) - Do it, come on! - [Gang Members] Do it! Do it! Do it! - What's the matter with you, people? Am I the only one here that can see how stupid this is? (Billy panting) This isn't a fight about honor. This isn't a fight about respect or space. - They owe us. - Nothing. They owe us nothing and we deserve nothing. - My father's dead now because of a fight, and it didn't bring him honor. It didn't bring him anything. I didn't fight for my honor today, I saved it by stopping. I don't need your respect, loyalty or anything. (boxes thudding) - Well, I'll be... (Clyde scoffs) - Nah, he wasn't part of Pack 13 anyways. - Yeah, the fight was a bust, Clyde. - Oh yeah? The fight is on! - Anyone who wants to leave can do so right now. - Anyone who wants to leave can do so right now. - [Gang Members] What? What? What? - But, uh, anyone who wants to stay and finish this can stay and fight right now! - [Gang Members] Yeah! - Let's go! - Let's do it. (gang members clamoring) - You did it, boyo! I knew you had it in you. - Yeah? I wasn't too sure about it myself. - Warrior that I am, you taught me a thing or two today. - Really? What's that? - Sometimes it takes far more courage and bravery to sheath the the sword than to wield it. Congratulations. - Thanks. - Wait up, lad. - I can't imagine what more there is to do. - It's getting worse, isn't it? - Billy! - [Boy] Hey Billy, we seen you. - [Girl] We were there. - [Boy] You were great. - All is not lost, boyo. This could be the one. Don't get we'll get shy on me now, lad. Here she comes. - I saw your fight today. - You did? - And I heard what you said. - Oh. - Well I, I thought you were very brave. - Oh, not really. - Yes, you were. You were wonderful. And everyone knows it. Do you think maybe we could sit together at lunch tomorrow? - Yes. - Yes. Yes. - Well, great! Then, then I'll see you there. - Bye. - Great. Great. - Bye - Bye. Yes! - Yes! - Oh, are you okay? (Yarik chuckles) - I just can't figure it, can you? - No, no, I can't. - Well, downtown was the scene of another serious incident this afternoon, gang related, young gang related. 12-year-olds, 13-year-olds, wounded, bloodshed. Two ended up in the County General Hospital. Some say it's because of the family values falling apart, others say we need more police on the streets. Anyway, this is Sam Weinberg sending it back to you, Pam. (pensive music) - I need the number for County General Hospital, please. (pensive music continues) (Yarik groaning) - Oh, oh, oh, oh. Ooh. Oh. Ah, it seems I can't go no further, lad. - [Billy] I don't know what else to do, Yarik. I mean, are you stuck here till I'm president? - Look at your mother's face. - I mean, if we're up to me, I'd have you back in your own world. I know how much you miss her. - Look, look at your mother. I understand her very well, you know? Her feeding of lost love. Look, she's holding his picture. - She must miss my dad an awful lot. - To be separated from your love is a horrible thing, I wouldn't wish it upon a soul. - Look, if you need Katrina so badly, then why doesn't she just come here too? Didn't you say that if the need is great and the subject is worthy? It looks to me like you need her badly. - But it's your need that's important here, laddie, not mine. - Well, then I won't need anybody ever again. 'Cause what does it get you? My father back? It doesn't get anything but hurt and being alone. - Billy, you're not alone. Don't you ever say that, lad. The pain you feel for him now is dreadful, but it's infinitely better than never having felt love at all. You carry your father's love with you wherever you go. You just can't feel it or feel him because you're so blasted good at feeling sorry for yourself. Your father never left you, he is part you, lad, always will be. So don't despair, partner. - Well, she does it to me too. - Oh, "She does this. I do that. She does this." Stop avoiding the problem. What are you so afraid of. (somber music) - Losing her. - Oh, well, that's a horse of a different color now, isn't it? Perhaps you should be telling her this. (somber music continues) (Billy sighs) (gentle music) - Well, come on, Yarik. This could be your ticket out of here. Let's go talk to Mom. - You don't need me, lad. I have nothing left to teach you. You're no longer a squire. It's your turn to accept the mantle of knighthood. (gentle music) (door squeaks and bangs) (door slams) - Where have you been? (somber music) God, Billy, look at you. What happened? - It's okay, Mom. - What is this supposed to mean? - It's, it's okay, Mom. I, I'm okay. - Where have you been? Don't lie to me! How could you do that? - I'm not in a gang, Mom. They wanted me to, but I said, no. I promise. (somber music) - I saw on the news, the jacket, (sniffles) I got so afraid. - But you never worried before. - Billy, I worry about you all the time. I just didn't like to show it. (somber music continues) (mom sighs) When your father died, (sniffles) I felt so abandoned. - Yeah, me too. - And you were becoming the spitting image of him: your laugh, your temper. I just, I couldn't lose everything again. I couldn't do it again. (somber music continues) Maybe I shut you out. And the more I pulled away from you, the more like him you became. (somber music continues) - It's okay. It's okay. (mom sobbing) - Tonight, tonight I prayed with all my heart and with all my soul that if you would just in that door, I would crawl through hell to make sure you knew how much I loved you. (sighs) - I miss you so much. (somber music continues) - I'm sorry, sweetie. You know, your father just got mixed up with the wrong people. He loved you and he loved me, and he would never want anything bad to happen to us. - He doesn't have to worry. (mom sniffles) - I love you, Billy. - I love you too. (gentle music) (mom sniffles) (gentle music continues) - Do you hear that? - What? (gentle music continues) - Over here. (gentle music continues) (gentle music continues) - [Mom] It's a beautiful night. - Yeah, it is. (gentle music continues) Hi, Mr. Fallon. - Ooh, welcome back, Billy. (chuckles) - I came to return this. - So soon? - Thanks for everything, Mr. Fallon. - Why? In fact, what did I do? What are you thanking me for? - You were right. - I was right?
