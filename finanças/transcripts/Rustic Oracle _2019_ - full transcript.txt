When you were born, the first thing I felt was overwhelming happiness. The second thing I felt was fear. Not only because I was a young mother, but... because I knew I was bringing you into a world that isn't always safe for girls like us. I was your age when I discovered that. Back then, I was just like you: I too only saw the beauty of the world around me. Here, make a wish. OK. This time, you blow one too. Right there. - Come on, grab your stuff. - We're leaving? Yeah. I think it's almost suppertime. Could we come back maybe? Um... maybe. No, that just means - he likes you. - What? No, he doesn't. - Yes, he does. - That's gross. Trust me, that's what boys do. So, if I pinch him back, he's gonna think - I like him back? - No. Boys are too stupid to get that. Good, 'cause I pinched him back. Good. Hard? Hmm... like this. Did he cry? Hmm... no. Almost. What are you doing home? - Start with "Hi, Mom." - Hi, Mom! How come you finished early? Where were yous? The school's been over for almost two hours. Finish setting the table, please. We stopped at the park. How come you're not at work? They cut my hours. I finished up for an hour. Will you be home for supper more? That's cool, I guess. ...are not shy to show affection. So, what are you gonna do? Wolves had their puppies in the spring. And even though they live in an underground hole... Did you give your name to Council yet for the summer jobs? Here's a fun fact you probably didn't know. Wolves... You're not spending another summer bumming around town doing nothing! Hey! Mom! Quit it, you two! Wolves are strong, fierce, agile and... So where did you go last night? Out. You came home late. Again. Mom, could you pass me the ketchup, please? - Becoming quite the habit. - Your nagging is too. Excuse me? - I'm done. - No, you're not. Finish eating. do you think I like being a nag? - Who were you with? - Friends. - What were you doing? - Am I on trial? For fuck sake! Watch your mouth! Hey. I just... I don't like you being out so late, especially on a school night. So, I'm just supposed to sit in this shithole all the time? Oh, that's... that's real nice. - I'm not 10 years old. - You're not an adult either! Yeah, 'cause you were a real angel at my age, Ma. We are not talking about me! - Good thing! - What the hell - is that supposed to mean? - Are you gonna eat that? Go put your PJs on. Come back and do your homework. I don't have any. Aaah! Loser's here! I hate Goof, he always calls me Poison. Where are you going? On the front lawn, Mother. Is that OK with you? Jesus Christ! Mr. Bear, look, I found a friend for you. Really? Who's that? Oh, it's a new... it's a new friend. He's called Talking Hand. Say hi, Talking Hand. Hi. Say hi, Mr. Bear. Hiya. Hi, Ivy. What's his name? His name is Mr. Bear. OK, lights out. I'm waiting out for Heather. Oh, that's my job, baby. It's late, you should be sleeping already. Why do you guys always fight? Um, we don't always fight. It's normal sometimes. Me and Tota used to fight all the time. - Really? Tota can yell? - Oh yeah. You have no idea. I deserved it though most of the time. But I thought you were a real angel. That's what Heather said earlier. Oh, she was being sarcastic, baby. I know. So was I. OK. Goodnight. - Did you do your homework? - Yeah. OK. Your hair smells. Tomorrow, I want you to wash it, OK? - OK. - OK. No, leave it on! - OK. Goodnight. - Goodnight. Ivy? Ivy, go back to bed. Come on. Get up, fart face. Leave me alone. Five more minutes. Come on! Get dressed or I'm leaving without you. Where did you get that? Tie your hair. What are you gonna do with all that money? I'm gonna buy the Moon. Just how do you wear your backpack like that? 'Cause it's cool. Trying to be cool for your boyfriend? Shut up! - Hey. - Hey. So, how was - the rest of your night? - Shut up. - Well...? - "Well" what? What did you do after I left? Nothing. We just hung out. Drop it. Or should I say, who did you do? Court, shut up. Alright. See you later, fart face. - Later, booger breath. - Nice one. OK, class, I'd like you to start having your name on the left-hand side of your papers. OK, we're gonna be starting with our first work. Numbers 1 to 5, you have... OK, the first word is... red. Red. Next word: green. Green. Yellow. Yellow. Purple. Purple. Black. Black. Ivy? Ivy? Do you know what Jeff did today in school? - What? - But did you see what Jeff did? Yeah. He threw a pencil at Ms. George. How didn't he get in trouble? I did not know at all. I think he was mad at her because... You know, the test that we had to do? - Yeah? - He got a B. Did you... - did you like gym class today? - Yeah. What was your favourite part? Dodgeball. I mean, I kept getting out, but it was pretty fun. Where's Heather? Not sure. On her way, I guess. I gotta go. Later. Bye. - See you tomorrow! - Bye. I can't believe that girl. So sick of her shit. Already so short-staffed, I don't know what the hell they're thinking. They always pick on the ones who need it the most. Telling you. Money is so tight; how am I gonna manage this? Well, you know I can watch the girls anytime you need, OK? I can make them supper. - Thanks. - They're cutting my hours too, - I'm sure. - No, don't say that. Where's Heather? She probably hangs out with her friends, baby. She'll be back soon. Get some shoes on your feet. Ivy! Come play! - Have you seen my sister? - No! No. Uh, no, no. No worries. You know Heather. No, she probably just decided to skip with her friends or something. You know, it's the end of the year anyway, so it's not like they go very much. No, I know it's not an excuse. It's not what I'm saying. Look, just... just call me if she shows up at your place or if you see her. No. I mean, just... If she shows up at your place tomorrow or... ...just call me at the elders' home, OK? - I will. - OK. Oh! - Mm-hmm. - Take care of yourself. O:nen. - She's not at Tota's? - No. Hello? - Hey, Jeff. It's Susan. - Hi, Susan. Is Heather at your place by any chance? No. Haven't seen her in a while. Is Courtney home? - No, she went to work. - Was she in school today? Yeah, but she hasn't seen Heather. No. Uh, Heather didn't, um... I got a call that she skipped school this afternoon, so I was just... Can you ask Courtney to call me when she gets home? - For sure. - Thanks. - Hello? - Hey, Joanne, I'm sorry to call so late. - Have you seen Heather? - No. Why? She was in class this morning, so... So, she's still going to school? She's graduating in a couple of weeks. - Criminal record? - No. Boyfriend? She hangs out with a couple of guys. Uh... not sure if any of them is an actual boyfriend. There's Goof, Matthew Walters. They went out for a while. You should talk to him for sure, he lives a few doors down. What about her other friends? I can give you a list. Siblings? I have another daughter, Ivy. She's 8. She's sleeping. - And their father? - Dead. My dad is not dead! Go back to bed, baby. My dad's not dead. Heather's father is dead. Your father is... gone. Any chance that she could be with him or would... wanna try and find him? - No. No chance. - I'll need you to put his name and possible contact on the list. - Does she do any drugs? - No. Alcohol? Not that I know of. She's gonna be 17 though, so I don't know. And you? No. How would you describe your relationship with your daughter? Good. Normal. I don't know. Normal. Like any single mother with a stubborn, smartass teen. Any recent fights? We had a bit of an argument last night, but nothing out of the ordinary. What was she wearing the last time you saw her? Uh... Red t-shirt, I think. Blue. Blue t-shirt. And her orange and brown checkered shirt wrapped around her waist. She had her blue jeans, the ones with the holes in the knees... her purple boots. Her backpack is... khaki colours. Khaki. And she wrote a big A with a circle around it in black marker. It's very helpful. Thank you. You mind if I ask her a few questions? Of course. How has your sister been acting lately? Like strange or different? How are things at home? Good. Did she ever talk about... I don't know, running away or not wanting to live anymore? - Excuse me?! - What?! - No! - I just have to ask. I'm sorry about that, but if she did run away... - She didn't run away! - She wouldn't leave her little sister alone on the side of the road like that. Look. You got into an argument last night; she probably took off to get back at you. She's not the first, and she won't be the last. Nine out of ten times, teenagers just want to piss off their parents. She's probably hiding out at friends, and she'll be home tomorrow. If not? If not, you can call me back. We'll take it from there. Mom? Am I going to school today? Go to your classroom, OK? I'll see you tonight. Could you pick me up when Heather gets back? OK, everyone! Settle down, please. Take a seat. I know these past few days have been extremely hard for everyone. We're all praying that Heather will return home safe and sound. I'm expecting all your parents to come out later today to participate in the community search party. Now, I know I've said this before, but I'm saying it again because it is so important, "If anyone knows "anything about Heather, "you must speak up. "If you have seen anything, "if you have heard anything, "even if you don't think it's important. "And you don't have to speak to the police. You can come in see one of us." We're here for you. Everyone, gather around, please! Get together. We want to form groups of three because we have, like, dozens of areas we wanna cover. OK, come on, groups of threes. - Did you page her? - Of course. Why are you mad? This is your fault. You brought him here! I didn't bring him here. Besides, you thought he was cool until he started hitting on her. Shut up. - Who was hitting you? - No one. - What's going on? - They're talking about Heather. - Shut up, Poison. - Hey! - What the hell is going on? - I swear, I told the cops everything. You tell 'em you and Heather had been running errands? Fuck off, Goof! Someone better start explaining. It's just this guy that's been hanging around town. What guy? They've been weighing and packing his weed for him. - You what?! - Once. OK, once. He paid us and that was it. Come on, honey, let's go get some food. - What did you tell the cops? - The truth. We've been hanging out with Shawn for a while. Where is he from? Who is this guy? It's this guy we met at... He started hanging out with us. - Hey. - Hey. Want some? - No thanks. - Wanna go race our bikes down the hill? Nah. Sorry about your sister. - Why? You didn't do anything. - I know. Fine. - Later. - O:nen. Thanks for showing up! So you knew about this Shawn guy? This bum who's been hanging around my daughter - for weeks apparently? - Slow down. Calm down. No. Why didn't you tell me about this Dumas or Dumont or whatever the hell his name is? Where's Courtney? What did she tell you about him? Hmm? You know he's a drug dealer? Look, we know about Shawn. We're aware of it. We're looking into it. We have his description. Right now, we don't know if your daughter is with him or not... - Are you fucking kidding me?! - I said, "Calm down." No! I will not calm down, you incompetent, - pointless piece of shit! - Come on, let's go home. Watch it. I know this is hard for you. We're doing our best. As soon as we have a lead, we'll let you know. Oh yeah? When is that gonna happen? I've been waiting for days for one of you to call me back! - Calm down. Calm down. - Susan, enough! - We will let you know. - Yeah? Pff! Take this off. - Ooh, you're cold. - Uh-huh. Geez! Are you sure this is washed? - Is Heather in trouble? - I hope not. We'll find her soon. Don't worry, OK? What is it? It's a friendship bracelet. - We're friends? - We're best friends. - Hello? - Hi, Susan. Hi, Jeff. Can you tell Courtney we'll be leaving at around 9 tomorrow morning? Yeah, about that, I don't think she can go. What? Look, it's only for a few days. This is the only lead we have. Why don't you let the cops handle this? The police aren't doing shit, you know that. - No. Dangerous? How is it... - Look, she's my daughter and I don't want her going. I'm sorry. So what am I supposed to do?! Look, Jeff, please, I... Your daughter knows what this guy looks like. I need her with me. Jeff, you know I would never let anything happen to Courtney. I'm sure you wouldn't have let anything happen to Heather either, but that's... What's wrong? - Courtney can't come with me. - Where are you going? Maybe you can take Goof. He's seen him. - Where are you going, Ma? - I have to leave town - for a couple of days, baby. - Why? To try to find your sister. I'll go with you. I wanna find her too! I know, but you're gonna stay with Tota for a couple of days. No, I'm going with you. - You can't come with me, Ivy! - Yes, I can! Maybe you and I can have a fun few days, do a few things together? - I know what he looks like. - What do you mean? At school, Heather was talking to him. I saw them out the window. How come you're just telling me this now?! I don't know. I... I don't know. Can I go with you? Where are we going anyway? Montreal. This is the new search notice. It was sent out to our entire network of contacts, border services, public transit services, various police forces, shopping centres, restaurants and youth shelters. OK. Thank you. And I found out that Val-d'Or Police did issue an arrest warrant last year for a Shawn Dumas who could fit the description you have, but that's all I know right now. - OK. - We sent out another press release to all media outlets, but let's be honest, a soon-to-be 17-year-old presumed runaway doesn't usually get much air time on camera. But we're not giving up. We'll keep reaching out. I'm not giving up until we find answers, OK? When they searched Heather's belongings, - did they find any...? - Who? The police? They haven't searched anything. Bedroom? Student locker? Locker, I have no idea, but they haven't - searched the house. - Well, it's... I thought they would have. Must be standard. How's Ivy? Good. She's, uh... she's OK. Let me know if there's anything I can do. - She's here actually. - Really? Yes, waiting in the hall. Oh, I would love to meet her. - Hi! - Hi. - You must be Ivy. - Yeah. I'm Renée. It's nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Your mom and I were about to make some copies, - you wanna help? - OK. Can you hang that up on that wall there? Take a few of these and pass them out as people come by. I'm gonna go in here and give them some. Stay where I can see you though. Got it? Excuse me. My daughter's missing. Have you seen this girl around? My sister. She's missing. Missing, huh? You know what? I'll keep my eyes open for her, OK? Oh, hello! Hahaha! - Are we going back home? - No. I wouldn't have packed a bag if we were going straight home. Well, I'm getting hungry. Why don't you nap, it'll pass quicker. Val-d'Or is still hours away. - What's that? - A cheese sandwich. - You made those? - Yeah. - When? - When you and Tota were packing my bag. Heather makes them for me all the time when you work late. Need to focus. No. No. Baby, wake up. Come on, wake up. We're gonna go inside. Get your bag. Don't get the bed all wet. Have you ever stopped in a motel, Mom? - Yeah. - Whoa, you're lucky. Mom? Mom? - Mom? - Hmm? I'm thirsty. Grab a glass from the bathroom and get some water from the tap. - From the sink? - Mm-hmm. She loves me. She loves me not. She loves me. She loves me not. - She loves me. - Ivy? IVY?! Jesus Christ! Don't scare me like that! - What? - You don't just wander - outside like that! - Why? Just stay inside, hear me? OK. Come on, get dressed. We gotta get going. Oksa! Why? Where are we even going? Enough with the questions. Just get ready, we'll go get some breakfast, OK? Enough. I don't feel like playing a game, baby. I'm gonna let you go first. I win. Too easy. Rematch? I see what you're doing! Nice try. - I win. - What? As if! Excusez-moi, have you seen this girl by chance? Wanna play again? - Shit! - Mom, your turn. I'm done playing, Ivy. One more game? I'll let you start. Ivy, quit it! I said I'm done. Thank you. Sit up. Sit down. Up or down? Madame Russell? No. I hope you speak English because me, I don't speak Indian. Neither do I. Shh! Yes, I speak English. We've been notified of your daughter's disappearance. Every officer has her description. If we see anything, we will notify the officers in charge of her case. Yeah, but I'm... I'm here because I have more information. The case worker at Missing Children's said... OK, madame, madame! We are not in charge of this case. You need to take that information to the officer back home working on it. But nobody's doing anything. They haven't moved an inch. I know that a man named Shawn Dumas was seen with my daughter the day she disappeared. And he's either from Val-d'Or or in Val-d'Or. What? Do you have any daughters, Officer Tremblay? What's his name again? Shawn Dumas. Hmm. "Shawn Dumas. "Drug trafficking, "drug possession, two counts of assault." Nice guy. "Currently wanted for breach of probation." Wait a second. This him? - Yeah. - Yes. Do you know him? Have you seen her in here? Just need a few minutes. I'm looking for my daughter. - Thank you. - Hey, she stays here! Just stay right here. Do not move, OK? Here. I'm not hungry. OK. Are we going back to the motel? I'm a little low on cash, so we're sleeping in the car. It's OK. Tota is sending some money. We'll be fine, it's just for tonight. Here. Put your PJs on. Here. I can ask the street team if they've seen him recently. I haven't seen him in months. And I've never seen your daughter. Maybe... that's a good thing. I just don't know what to do anymore. He has no family apparently. His parole officer has no idea where he is. Heather's friends haven't heard from either of them. And some guy I met in one of the bars said that he was this... out-of-pocket smuggler working some circuit, which means he could be anywhere, and that means Heather could be anywhere. - Who said this? - Said what? About the circuit. Some guy I met in one of the bars. Ivy... how would you like to see the gathering room? Hmm... There's some games, some puzzles. No thank you, I'm good here. How old are you, Ivy? 8. This must be strange for you, being here so far away from home. You're a brave girl to be helping your mom find your sister. There's something I need you to do for me - while I talk to your mom. - OK. Can you water my flowerpot, please? Yeah. There's a sink in the kitchen. OK. Out-of-pocket smugglers recruit girls to be sold into prostitution. No. That doesn't mean that's what's happened to Heather. But I have to explain this to you. Most of the time, the young men don't even know it's a human-trafficking ring. hey just recruit the girls. Thank you, Ivy. Do you have a place to stay while you're here? Family? - No. - We slept in our car. Just last night. We were a little low... The night before, we stayed at the motel by the highway. OK. Well, you can stay there again tonight. We can help you find a way to cover the cost. You're welcome here anytime. We have community meals, activities, counseling, support, whatever you need. Thank you. But he was here about five months ago. Shouldn't that help? Did you talk to Amanda? No, that's... that's Courtney. Her other friend, Amanda. Amanda on the list. On the list that I gave you. Ivy, turn that down. Have you spoken to anyone new? Anyone else? Yeah. OK. Thank you. Ahhh... c'est beau. Mom, phone! Answer it. - Hello? - Hi, honey. - Tota! - How are you? - Good. - I miss you. Miss you too. Guess what. We had Chinese food at a restaurant. You did? Lucky you! Was it good? Mm-hmm. Did you get that $5 I sent you for candy? - Yep. - What did you get? I got chocolate and suckers and Fun Dip. Yummy! Good for you. Tota, you know what? Everybody here speaks French. Like everybody. Except for Karen. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. How is your mom? Hmmm... she's OK. - Tired. - Yeah, I bet - she is. - Bye, Tota. OK. Bye, sweetie. Hey. She's uh... she's good. No. Not much. Uh... I'm a little low on cash. OK. Yeah, Ma. Ivy, help me! Leave me alone! Stop! Heather. Heather. - Heather! - Ivy? Ivy! Ivy! Heather! Hea... - Ivy, stop, baby! - HEATHER! - Ivy, stop! Baby, baby, stop! - Heather! Heather! Stop, stop, stop, stop! Ivy, wake up, wake up! - Heather! Heather! - Hey! Shut the fuck up! - Ivy? - Heather! Heather! Ivy, Ivy, Ivy, baby. I know, I know, I know. It's a dream. It's a dream, she's not here. Ivy, wake up. Stop, baby, stop. It's just a dream. Ivy, baby, stop. Baby, I know. It's a dream. It's OK. It's OK. It's OK. - I saw her. - I know. It's OK. It's OK, baby. It's OK. Are you OK now? Where's my dad? I don't know. Why did he leave? 'Cause he had to. Did you love him? I used to. Then why did you let him leave? I didn't let him leave, I made him leave. What?! Why? Sometimes, you just have to. Because... ...because you and Heather deserve better. What about... Heather's dad? - What about him? - Did you love him too? Yes. Very, very much. So, him, you wanted him to stay? Yes. Why did he die? He fell in the lake and froze. I know that, but... how? We used to have an ice-fishing carnival every year. That year it was cancelled because we had a warm winter and the ice wasn't thick enough. But Heather's dad and a few of his buddies went anyway. And they waited 'til sundown because they wanted to fish walleye. It was too dangerous with the truck, but he said he would be fine on the snowmobile. Turns out the ice was a lot thinner than they thought; he fell through. His buddies tried to get him out, but... ...by the time they did, he was dead. Is Heather dead? I don't know. I hope not. Me too. Hey. Is my mom back? Not yet. They just left Amos, so she should be here soon. What are you making? I heard you haven't been sleeping very well. You've been seeing Heather? My mom has such a big mouth. - She's worried about you. - No, she's not. - I think she is. - You don't know my mother. She may not know how to show it right now, but she's worried about you, and she cares. You want to tell me about your dreams? It's always the same. I'm trying to walk in the house. - I hear my sister. - Don't... Don't... No. No. Then I see... ...him. Who do you see? I'm done. - What is it? - I don't know. Kind of looks like a snake, I guess. Except it doesn't have that many colours on Shawn's arm. What do you mean? The snake on Shawn's arm... ...the other guy had it too. What other guy? The guy my mom talked to at the bar. Him and Shawn had the same tattoo. Woo! Woo! Woo! Hahaha! Ivy, come see. This is for you. - Really? - Yeah. You take way better care of it than I did. They have some territories near... I'll take her home. It's probably a good idea. OK. Thank you so much. Thanks. Why don't you stick around a few more days just until you hear back from them. Yeah, could we stay? Mom, please? Ivy, get in the car, OK? I don't want to fight with you. Bye, sweetie. Be a big girl and listen to your mom, OK? You can come back and visit. - Haha! - Or maybe I'll come visit you. Sound good? Thank you, Karen. Why are we even going to Ottawa anyway? Because apparently that's where the guy - with the tattoo went. - Shawn? No, the other guy. His name's Eric. Oh. You're sure it's Shawn you saw in the schoolyard with Heather, not this guy from the bar? This Eric? Yes. And you're sure they had the same tattoo? Yes. Shawn's is here, and the other guy, Eric, his is here. - You don't believe me? - Of course I do, baby. We have to tell the police this, OK? And, Renée, she's gonna meet us in Ottawa. OK? OK. We're gonna go stay at my friend Hawi's in Ottawa. Do you remember Hawi? - No? - No. You knew her when you were really little. - Hawi? - She's my best friend. We got pictures of her. In the photo albums? Pictures of me when I was young? - You don't remember? - Mm-mm. She used to babysit you. - Me and Heather? - Mm-hmm. She changed your diaper and everything. My diaper? Mm-hmm. Hey, Suzie Q. And hey there, Ivy! Wow, you've gotten so big! I can't believe it. - Well, come in, come in. - Go ahead. Thanks. ...Alright, just leave your bags there. And I just put the sheets in the dryer, shouldn't be too long. Oh, you really didn't have to. I'm just thankful to have a place to crash. Of course. You can stay as long as you want. Thank you. - Want some tea or something? - Yeah, sure. I haven't laughed like that in years. Well, you know you can always count on me for that. Yeah. Oh, I missed you, Suzie Q. And I missed you too. What's so funny? Hey. Your ma when she was a teenager. Yeah, all me. - What are you doing up? - Can't sleep. Look what I found. Oh, my gosh! Well, that is years ago. Oh, I love this picture. Is that Heather's dad? Yep. That was at the fair. It's just probably a few months before... Yeah. Do you have any pictures of my dad? No. I'm tired, baby. Let's get some sleep. - Goodnight, you two. - Goodnight. - No. No. - I swear, it's all gonna be OK. - What are you doing up, baby? - Daddy? GET OFF HER! Nice! Have you ever been here before? No. Who is she? Someone who's trying to help. Does she know the guy we're looking for? - The... Eric guy? - Yes. And thanks to you and what you told the police, a lot of people are looking for him now. That, uh... that tattoo they have, it's a tag, a symbol to show that they're part of the same gang. Is she in that gang? No. She knows them though. Here, let me show you something cool. Huh? How did you get that that far? All in the wrist. - She said she'll do it. - Good. Goal! Yes! Did you see that, Mom? - Mm-hmm. - It's nine to zero. Yeah? It's easy to score when there's no one stopping you. You try and stop me then. Come on! I bet I could score on my first kick. You don't know who you're dealing with, little missy. - Oh yeah? - Oh yeah. Aha! Aha! Alright, bring it on. - Oh, really? - Uh-huh. Ohhh... Aha! No fair, you're too big for the goal! No. Hey, that's cheating. Suzie? Phone's for you. It's Renée. I'll play with you if you want. Come on! Haha! Come on! Stop pulling away. - Renée! - Don't get your hopes up. They've arrested Eric and another mover on their circuit, but there's still no sign of Shawn. There might be four or five other girls on the move. Mom, did they find Heather? Mom! We have spoken to the police in Thunder Bay. - Thunder Bay?! - Mom, is she OK? Mom? Mom? Ivy, enough! Why don't we step into my office. Stay here. Are we going home? You are. I have to go somewhere else first. Where? Another city where your sister might be. - I wanna go with you. - No. This time, you can't. What?! Why?! - We have to go back! - What?! I forgot my plant! We're not going back for a plant. Yes, we are! I want my plant! We don't have time to go back. I'll get you a new plant, OK? - What are you doing? - I'm going to get my plant. - No, you're not! - Yes, I am! No. You get back in the car now! Enough! Enough now! Enough! I said we'd get a new one. I don't want another plant! I want that one! I'm not leaving my plant, it's gonna die without me! Ivy, I am trying to stay calm, but you are making it really difficult. - We have to get home! - Why? - So you can leave me too?! - What? You made my dad leave, and you made Heather leave! Ivy, your father was a bad man. - No, he wasn't... - Yes, he was! You don't remember him, and I'm glad that you don't, but he wasn't a good person, baby. I left him to protect you and Heather. I just... just want to find Heather and bring her home. I just want her here! But I'm here. I miss her.

Stay in the car. Mom, what's wrong? Mom? What's wrong? Ista! Ista! Who is that? - What is this? - I don't know. I'll have a couple of guys come down. - Is it her? - You cannot be here. Is it her? Is it her? Is it my daughter?! It's not her. It's not her. It's not Heather, OK? You can't be here. It's Shawn! NOOO! NOOO! - What did he do with her?! - Shhh... Calm down. - WHAT DID HE DO WITH HER? - Calm down. You can't stay here. Stay back. What do I do now? What do I do now? What do I do... Where is she? Where is she? Where is she? Good morning, sleepyhead. Hello? Oh, my goodness, Susan! Did they find Heather? How many girls? Do any of them know her? Are you OK? My mom helped save four girls that summer. None of them were Heather. She hasn't given up on finding her, though. I don't think she ever will. My girl, when I look at you, I see your Tota's grit and fierceness. I also see your auntie Heather's kindness and sense of humour. So even if the world gets scary, remember that you carry all of our strengths. Sometimes, the tiniest of flowers have the strongest roots. You also have Heather's smile. I'm so thankful for that because it helps me see the beauty of the world again.
