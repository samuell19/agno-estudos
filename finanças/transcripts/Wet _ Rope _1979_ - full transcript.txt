Only I could catch a doctor. That was pure luck! Are you also happy? Please! Are you tired? Take a bath! Yes,o.k.. What are you doing there? You lost your innocence! And now you want to call the police? In what kind of light should that set me? That doesn't work! Go out of my life! Stop, stop! Leave me! You can't die! Leave me alone Our god doesn't accept suicide! How does it look like? Don?t you want to try to stay to your sins? And to beg for mercy?

He is the almighty god! Come in! I've heard already a lot about you the priest. From the priest? Priest Sabiel is the priest of our community.

You will understand it someday. What's going on? What's wrong? Wait! What do you think, where they are going to? To the prayer! This way! We were crazy because of temptation and stained ourselves. Hit us! No, no! It was me, who was crazy. Me! Please, hit me much harder! This guy is here to make good playmates out of us. In a nunnery with strong rules this is impossible. But what is about the lust, if here are so many great guys running around? Harder, harder! Great god, please tell me what I should do. Good day! Wait! You want to inform somebody very quick, don?t you? Don't be afraid! You must be treated, otherwise you will die! I got her out! Are you a doctor? No, no! I am a nurse.

She had a bad experience. that's why that sheep went to this nunnery. Who is Yuko Kasama? No idea! Why do you ask? What do you have in common with this girl? She's here, isn't she? You should keep your nose out of that! What can we do for you? Do you know this man? During amobargument he was shot in his left shoulder. We don't know that man. We haven?t seen him before! Men are not allowed to come in! That's why he can't be here. Oh than I am sorry! It says, that he was seen close to here. I thought you maybe noticed something. If you notice something, please inform me. Please bring this to the Sankt Michaelis church! With pleasure! Oh, and please take Miki with you! It must be looked, if there's something left from her heritage. You understand, don?t you? Yes. Have you been fallen in love before? Really in deep love? And you were betrayed for sure. Such idiots!
