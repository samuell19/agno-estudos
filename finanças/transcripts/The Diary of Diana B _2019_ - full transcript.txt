HULAHOP presents In co-production with Supported by The knowledge of such immense suffering could only be borne by throwing ourselves even further into the demanding work that lay ahead of us. THE DIARY OF DIANA B. My name is Živko. I don't know when I was born. I don't know where I was born. Just as I don't know who my parents were. Zagreb, 1943 Could you please? Diana Budisavljević Campaign. Go ahead. Thank you. The orphanage. Three tonight. I have their numbers. I was very little, of course. I don't remember the camp. I remember... ...the orphanage. But through a fog. Just that I was somewhere... But up until that moment there's nothing. I don't even remember coming to Zagreb. I don't remember it at all. Dear Mrs. Diana, I've heard you've done many favours for those of us in Germany. This is why I'm asking you about my lost children. Namely, my daughter, Stojna Pejić. Born in 1936. Son, Lazo Pejić. Born in 1940. Lazo and Stojna were both last seen in the Gradiška camp. Pejić, Pejić, Pejić... Sounds familiar. Pejić... They could be from the village Podgradci on Mount Kozara. We almost know them all by heart now. You're right. The Pejićs are from Podgradci. Pejić Dušanka, Pejić Anka, Pejić Borislavka, Pejić Bosa, Pejić Gordana, Pejić Gospava, Pejić Lepa, Pejić Milovan, Pejić Nada, Pejić Smilja... Two years earlier April 1941 Thank you for coming. I just had to wait for the army to pass, but otherwise it's fine out there. I was unsettled by all these planes flying around lately. Let us pray. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. -Amen. Yes... Yes. We'll take it in a bit here, loosen it a bit here, shorten it, and it'll be as good as new. Lovely fabric. Did you buy it in Innsbruck? Yes. These fabrics are always in fashion. Unfortunately, the shop is now closed. The owner was a wonderful gentleman. He knew my father. He was Jewish? I believe so. Mrs. Reich, I have to tell you I was in Innsbruck just before it all started up here as well. I heard awful things about the camps in Germany. Camps for people of your faith. There are camps here already. Supposedly, more than a few. The Jewish Community is collecting relief for those poor people. Thank you, Justina. We'll help ourselves. They're women, Julije. Women! Jewish and Orthodox. Lobor-grad Castle is a nursing home. It was founded by a colleague of mine. That's how I know. You've clearly misunderstood something. You know nothing about what's happening. It would seem news travels faster in the country than it does here. We simply need to be patient. This situation can't last. The Ustasha took... -They're common criminals! Pavelić and his lot were in jail until yesterday. Now all of a sudden, they're great statesmen. The Germans have brought scum to power. We're Orthodox, Julije. To the Ustasha, we are no better than the Jews or the Gypsies. It all seemed a lot bigger then. These arches stick out in my memory. It was my first encounter with a castle. Although it was a concentration camp, at first sight we thought it magnificent. Madam, you are not allowed to be here. We're not open to the public today. You are? Diana Budisavljević. Dr Budisavljević's wife. Chief physician Budisavljević? Come in, please. Take a seat, please. Excuse the mess. People bring things they can't take with them. Those fortunate enough to have somewhere to go to. I've come to make a donation. Actually, to ask about Lobor-grad. I've heard there are women there. Jewish and Orthodox. You're Orthodox? My husband is. And you? I'm Austrian. Catholic. The nursing home has been turned into a camp under German administration. The Volksdeutsche are running it. It was for Jewish women only, but lately the Ustasha have been bringing more and more Orthodox women. You're sending aid to them? Only to Jewish women. Government orders. Who's helping the Orthodox? As far as I'm aware of, no one. May I donate this money for them? -Madam, you don't understand. I am not allowed to take donations for the Orthodox. This Community helps only the interned Jews. If you want, you can start your own organization. Without organized help, no one there will survive the winter. Especially the small children. The police can issue you with a permit to run a humanitarian organization. Give me a call if you decide to go through with it. I must go. Yes? (I beg your pardon...) Excuse me, Julko. I need to talk to you. Come in then. Sit down. I'm done for the day. Your prescription. I was at the Jewish Community. When? -Just now. And? It is all true what Mira said. Only worse. There are no elderly people there. Only women and children. How is this possible? Is sending relief to camps even legal? The Jewish Community has a permit. The kind we'd request. Everything has to be legal. We just need someone to head the campaign. A name in which to register it. Marko? I was thinking it should be you, Doctor. Your name carries weight. I've heard stories about you saving minister Budak's life before the war. That may well be, but I... I really couldn't. Doctors are very busy in times of war. Are you sure there isn't already an organization we could join? Not to my knowledge. -Not even the Orthodox Church? The Church will be of no use. They've elected a new Patriarch and founded the Croatian Orthodox Church. Makes no sense to even pray in such a church... I had my seventh birthday in this castle. This is where we played as children. When we were allowed to go outside. The place was heavily guarded. My brother and I would fight over five or six beans in a small cup. If he got one more than me, we'd fight about it. October 1941 We're starting to collect relief for Lobor-grad. First from our personal supplies. The most important thing is to send food, potatoes, carrots, sugar, powdered milk. The news of the Campaign travels fast. The first packages start to arrive. Mrs. Mira sent this, Madam. That's right. Let me help you. -Thank you. I've decided to keep a diary of the Campaign, to keep track of items collected and those still needed. I arrange transportation of the aid with the Jewish Community. Thank you. The truck makes deliveries twice a month. We are allowed to send our packages together with theirs. This room was much larger. It's been partitioned since. A lot of people could fit in here. Against the window there were three wooden platforms, one above the other. So-called beds. Where we used to sleep on hay, with some thin blankets to cover ourselves with. Everyone wanted to sleep next to the window, to get some natural light and see some of the world outside. There was snow all around. Mostly just snow. It seems this winter will be very cold. The most important thing is to get straw, blankets and warm clothes. Despite all my daily efforts, I still lack the necessary permit. Yes? -I have an appointment with Mr. Bresler. Your ID card, please. Here you go. How can I help you? Lobor-grad camp. I've started a private relief campaign for women and children held there. I need a license for such a humanitarian organization. We have no jurisdiction over camps. You'll have to go elsewhere. I went to the police. They sent me to you. You're the head of the Department for Child Protection. Excuse me. Mađer? Take this to the head office. We oversee children's homes. We have no access to camps. May I take a lunch break afterwards? -Yes. Are you really sending relief to Lobor-grad? -Yes, I am. What's the situation there? -Very bad. Are there any children? There are around 1000 Jewish and 200 Orthodox women with children there. I also work for the Red Cross. Not even they have permission to collaborate with the camps. How do you manage it? -Illegally so far, unfortunately. I don't want my associates to have problems. That's why I need an official work permit. I'm afraid no one can issue you with a permit that will guarantee your safety. Even if you acquire it from one office, another will still tell you it's not valid. That's how it is now. We have some supplies of powdered milk. I can give you that. Mr. Vukosavljević, you shouldn't be lifting such a heavy weight! The number of women and children at the camp keeps growing. We now send packages once a week. This is from Mrs. Becić. The painter's wife, you know. It'll go towards the shoes. They're the hardest to get. People are happy to give when they hear of the cause. The Campaign has grown to include a dozen permanent associates. Everyone had informed their acquaintances, who in turn spread the word. Hello. -Hello. I heard you were collecting aid for the Orthodox. For mothers and children. -These are my daughters' clothes. Thank you. I'll write down your name. -I'd prefer it if you didn't. The Jewish Community has been having more and more problems with the Ustasha authorities. Several times now the relief has ended up in the wrong hands. Nevertheless, we cannot give up. This is still the only way to get some of the aid into the camp. All we saw was hay, planks, bad food, filth, lice, disease... A lot of children fell ill and died. Those were my first encounters with death. What's the situation with the donations? -Bad. People were once glad to donate. They have nothing now. There's nothing left in the stores either. -True. Where's Julije? -He's on a night shift. Some of the children will be released from the camp. What'll happen to them? I've been asking myself the same question. Perhaps... I could take one. It's not that simple. Those children might be ill. In any case, you'd need an official permit. It could be dangerous. They could come for the child and for you. It might be someone bringing a donation. It happens. The Budisavljević residence? (-Yes. How can I help you?) We have a search warrant. Who are they? Serbs, the lot of them. Diana! They were only trying to scare us. Look at this. Serb 498. That's me. Serb 498. I had to register myself with the police. All Serbs must be registered. It has become so... It's dangerous. Promise me you'll stop the Campaign. I can't make that promise. Several months later, they close down Lobor-grad. More and more camps keep appearing. Our Campaign, however, doesn't end. May 1942 Dear Mrs Diana, I'm writing to you deeply shaken by events I have been witnessing as a military doctor here in Kordun. The entire Orthodox population is being transported to the camp. They are being rounded up so swiftly that even the bare necessities get left behind. Children mostly leave wearing light clothes, barefoot and half-naked. What they plan to do with these people, I do not know. Presumably they are taking them to Jasenovac camp. Please help in any way you can. At least save the children. Mrs. Diana, I once worked as a teacher there. I know those parts well. It's mainly Serbs who live there. If they've decided to cleanse the area, it'll be a blood bath. Who runs Jasenovac, the Germans or the Ustasha? -The Ustasha. Under the command of Maks Luburić. Perhaps you've heard of him. I have. Nothing good. Exactly. It'll be a disaster. I don't know... It was morning. We were still asleep. Mom came into the room and said, 'Get up, children! We're going to the camp.' Still half asleep, we got up shaking our heads. What camp? They would bring cornmeal porridge in a barrel. It had gone bad, turned bitter. There'd be a few potatoes or beans in the porridge. That was all. We'd get it once a day. Awful food. Pigs wouldn't eat it. If there were potatoes, we'd take them out and eat them. The beans were all wrinkled. They weren't cooked properly. The younger children would die. They couldn't even speak. Children my age were somewhat stronger. They'd manage somehow. The young ones would get severe diarrhoea. They'd die from diarrhoea. I used to run away from those children. The sacrifice you are making for your husband's people and faith commands utmost respect. Your Grace... people are being hoarded into trains and sent off like cattle. It simply isn't possible that you know nothing of this. No... I do not approve of this savagery. These Orthodox people are converting to Catholicism, hoping their lives will be spared. That's what they were told. This Christianisation under the threat of arms... I've protested it strongly to Pavelić. Which is why I now face certain difficulties. It is our duty as Christians to stand up for innocent people, especially children. I humbly ask you... to speak to someone... to order the release of mothers and children from the camps. Who should let them go? These camps are run by the Ustasha. And you are their confessor. I would advise you to plead with your own people. To bring innocent people here, children and mothers, and keep them hungry. Because of some religion you'd inherited. You lived that faith, whether you wanted to or not. And then you realized that no one liked or respected it. But it was your religion, and because of it you had to be punished. Orthodox, they called us. Not Serb. And so it was... I'm looking for nurse Habazin. -That's me. Kamilo Bresler said to... -I know. I've been expecting you. Transports are becoming a lot more frequent. As far as I know, the trains are headed to Germany. Carrying labourers. That's why the Germans patrol them. There are a few men, but most of them are women. Children? -I haven't seen any. Maybe the women on the train know where the children are. No one's allowed to talk to the people in the trains. It's strictly forbidden. My plan is to put you in contact with Sergeant Hecker. Ladies, do we have everything? -Yes. -Stay close to me. The train will be here shortly. We expect no problems. If any women get hysterical, a rifle butt to the stomach will do the trick. Or across the legs. We don't want any blood. Those to my left, get on the platform and take one group each. Those to my right, stay here in case anyone tries to escape. Understood? I'll come and get you. I came here with my mum, my sister and my three brothers. They took my sister out first. I've no idea where she ended up. They said she was going to Germany to work. Healthy and young women - to the left. Pregnant and old women - to the right. They'd say where each one had to go. They'd divide them up into groups first. So later on, they'd know what to do with them. Some would go to Germany, some into the camp, some straight into the river. It was bad. It's bad when a man stands in front of another man deciding on a way to kill him. See you tomorrow. You're still here. Yes. We can talk on the way home, I'll give you a lift. Who do you work for? I have a private organisation helping mothers and children... of Orthodox faith. What did you want to know? I wanted to find out where they come from and where their children are. We only get transports of women, no children. Where do the children end up then? -I don't know. Do you have children? This is it. Gradiška Camp is where the workers are selected. They might be there. Simply unbelievable... that such tall trees have grown in this place. Then again... more than 70 years have passed since I was last here. So it's no wonder really to see such tall trees here now... Tall and large. Hecker introduced me to Captain Von Koczian. We arranged a meeting at the Esplanade Hotel, where German officers reside. It's a campaign under my name to help Orthodox mothers and their children. Yes, I'm aware of that. This situation with children is definitely not in our interest. You know how sensitive the public is towards children. I'll discuss this matter with the General. But I need a permit to take the children out of the Gradiška camp. And who is supposed to issue such a permit? The Chief of State Security Office. Eugen Dido Kvaternik. Little Kvaternik? Well, yes, I know his father. We served together in the Austro-Hungarian army. He's a bit ridiculous, walking around with that little axe of his, isn't he? I wouldn't know. But his wife, Eugen's mother, was Jewish, wasn't she? -Yes. Sadly, she committed suicide recently. Why are you talking about such terrible things? -Because they're true. Talk to General von Horstenau. -I will. There was a wire fence. Lots of grass. It was hot when we arrived, but then it rained overnight. We were here for 3 days. We didn't get any food or water. We drank rainwater from puddles that had formed during the night. As for food... I'm not sure how, but some women gave us food. Corn. Kernels of corn, which we kept in our mouths, then later chewed. July 1942 After a month, we were finally granted permission to rescue the children. We entered the camp at 7 in the morning. There were a lot more children than we had expected. We first record the children whose mothers have already been transported to Germany. We put a name down next to each number. A tag with that same number is placed around the child's neck. We are assigned a doctor to assess each child's fitness for transport. Realizing that ours is a rescue mission, he finds all the children fit for travel. In the camp, the children are separated from their parents. Male and female children are also kept apart. The image remains seared in my memory. I think it will stay with me for as long as I live. I see it all before me. Me, my brother and my cousin got separated. I was 10. My brother was 7 and my cousin was 8. We didn't know what had happened to our sisters. One was 13, the other was 8 years old. Perhaps they ended up with the rest of the girls... The healthier boys had been dressed in Ustasha uniforms and we were not allowed to register them. They were about to take part in a propaganda film. The doctor took advantage of the guards inattention and led us to the so-called childrens hospital. We took those children as well, although they could not be saved. Most of them died that afternoon. They were lying all along the wall. They had no underwear, their large intestines had fallen out, flies all over them. An awful sight. Horrific. If this wall and this paint could talk about what happened here... You'd hear such stories... At 8 in the evening we were forced to terminate the campaign because there was no more room on the train. We took 700 children with us. In two days, we return to the camp. Women and children, not yet separated are sitting on a large lawn. The mothers are hoping to return to their homes soon. They dont want to hand their children over to me. And I know what awaits them. I tell them that I myself am a mother, that my husband is a doctor, an Orthodox, that the children will be accommodated and taken care of until they are set free. This time we take only those children capable of standing up on their own as it proved the smallest ones could not survive the transport. My sister stayed here and that's what hurts the most. I've been thinking about it for 70 years. But I've never had the strength to come here... And look for her. On the 70th anniversary of my family's tragedy we held a commemoration at our family tomb. We said, 'You are now among family.' 'It's been 70 years.' 'We haven't found your grave.' 'That's why we speak of you here...' 'So that you may forever stay with your family.' September 1942 You need to rest. I am no longer capable of field work, so I focus all my efforts on compiling a database. I copy our transport lists and complete them with the Red Cross data. Children's homes and rescue centres are overflowing. Families across Zagreb accommodate over two thousand small children. The Church finally gets involved... With the help of local priests, around five thousand children are soon accommodated by rural families. Letters from parents in German labour camps start to arrive. They ask about their children. Telling them that their child is alive brings us great joy. Occasionally, we have to break the saddest news. There are so many little, nameless children we have no information about. They cannot tell us anything about themselves. We have them photographed and register them by number. We keep a card index so as not to lose track of the children. I was chosen by a family. Marija and Josip Sabolić. For the first time in my miserable life I felt motherly love. Auntie Marija was the embodiment of a true mother. I truly loved her. And I also felt her love for me. She would organize... a trip to her vineyard. She wouldn't take just me though. She'd pick up as many children as she could fit in the cart. Children who were placed with other families. She'd even bake a special bread with walnuts for the occasion. Every time we'd go to the vineyard, she'd break the bread into pieces, give us one each, pick some grapes for us, and we'd eat that. Believe it or not, I can still smell those grapes. I had my own vineyards and grew my own grapes but I've never smelt such a scent. When I came back to my village, a few kilometres from Petrinja, the first thing I did was look for our house. There were only foundations there. Everything had been destroyed. I recognized a pear tree. Early-season pears, they were ripe. I sat under the tree, picked and ate a few pears. And then I cried my heart out. I walked around the courtyard, where I used to play with my brothers. No one came back. Just me. I was sitting under that pear tree and crying. Birds were singing, the orchard was green, the grass was tall... Plums in full bloom... Planted in a row. Not a living soul to look after it all. It had all been... cleansed. This number... It's my camp number. This is... This number is the only thing I have left from my earliest childhood. In fact, this was my last name. Živko 1128. But I had faith that someday, in an archive or somewhere, under that number... I might find something about myself. Where I'm from, when I was born, who my parents were... That didn't happen. This number is all that remains. 1128. May 1945 It's very easy, Silvia. Come on! Now you spin it. That's it! One more time. Let Granny see who's at the door. Hello, Comrade Budisavljević. -Mr. Mađer, what brings you here? I'm here on behalf of the Ministry of Social Policy. Which ministry did you say? Former Ministry of Social Welfare. This must be a misunderstanding. -It's not. Professor Bresler sent you? -Comrade Bresler has been suspended. Please, warn them about these three unmarked drawers. The children listed here haven't been identified yet. Who will be in charge of the index? I could help, or instruct them. You need to make sure it doesn't descend into chaos. Sure, I'll inform the new head. Someone will be in touch. Step aside, please. What if I refuse to hand it over? -I would advise against that. It'll look better if the report says it was handed over willingly. If I'm to be forced into willingness, you might as well take everything. There's no point in taking one without the other. Go ahead, please. This is how we went through life... Some survived... The lucky ones. And many died, with only a number where a name should have been. Hold on, put it down! To this day, the requisitioned files have not been found. More than 10,000 children were rescued by the Diana Budisavljević Campaign. Diana Budisavljevic 1891-1978 as Diana Witnesses In supporting roles The film is based on the book Diary of Diana Budisavljević 1941-1945 Original props from Diana Budisavljević's estate were used in its making.
