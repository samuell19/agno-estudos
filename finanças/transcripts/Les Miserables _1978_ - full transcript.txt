(THUNDER) Please! Please. Please. (BABY CRYING) Nothing. (BABY CRIES AGAIN) Jean! Thief! Stop! Stop him! Stop him! Thief! Help me! Thief! Stop him! Stop him! MAN: Name? Jean Valjean. OCCUPATION: Thief. No... Your Worship, I'm a woodcutter. This court sentences you to five years in prison. (MURMURING) Oh, dear God! No... Please, Your Worship... I'm a woodcutter, but, you see, there is no work. I... I can't find work. And my sister here and her children are starving. Take him away. No! Please! I'm not a thief, Your Worship. My father before me was a woodcutter... ...only he's dead now. My mother, too. My sister's own husband... All of them dead. If only I could find work... I beg you, Your Worship. Bread to eat, that's all. Just to eat... to live. Remove the prisoner!(BANGS GAVEL) Please! Please, I'm begging you. No! No, let me go! Please, you don't understand. SISTER: Jean! Please... No! No! Easy. There's nothing you can do anyway. (MAN SCREAMS) (SCREAMS) (SCREAMS) (SIZZLING) (GASPS) Oh! Ohh! (GROANS) Who is that prisoner? 24601. Name? Valjean. Jean Valjean. Take him off. Continue. (MEN SNORING) How beautiful is the moon tonight. Fool! Be quiet! Jean? You all right? Jean! It was my father's trade. What are you talking about? He taught me to be a woodcutter. For what? For this? Better he teach you to be a thief. Look out! Look out! Aagh! Go! Fetch a lever and a wedge. There isn't time. He'll be dead. No. Yes, look at him. He's dying already. Everyone, stay where you are! Jean! Are you crazy? You'll kill yourself. (GRUNTS) You two, get him out quickly! MAN: Come on, get back to work. (SNORING) (BELL RINGS) There he is, over there! Halt or I'll shoot! It is the decision of the Military Tribunal that five years be added to your sentence. I am requested by law to inquire if you have anything to say on your behalf. Yes. Well? I wish to give you my sacred promise, Monsieur. What? What's that? I've tried to live like a man. No more. If you treat men like animals, that is what you'll get. Three months' solitary confinement in the hole for insolence. Take him away. My sacred promise... The next time, I will escape! (SQUEAKING) (WATER DRIPPING) Who is that? Valjean. No, him. Yes, Inspector. It is Valjean. (BELL RINGS) It is the decision of the Military Tribunal that ten years be added to your sentence. I am requested by law to inquire if you have anything to say... for yourself. Some day... Speak up! (CLEARS THROAT) Some day I'll kill you. Six months in the hole for disrespect. Take him away. (RATS SQUEAK) (GROWLS) (ROARS) (SCREAMS WILDLY) (SCREAMING ECHOES) (SNORING) Coche? Hm. How long have you been here? 19 years. For what? I kill someone. What about him? Valjean? 19. We came here together. For what? A loaf of bread. He stole a loaf of bread. My God! Jean? Jean! Hm. You think... ...maybe someday you will get out? I will get out. What will you do? Steal. Bread? No, not bread. No... Oh, no... You don't kill for bread. Agh! Hey! Oh! Help! We should do something. What for? He'll fall, that's all, and be killed. Help! Help! Oh! Let me try. Go ahead. Break my chains. All right. Jean, no! Jean, no! Let me go. Let me go! Please help me! I can't hold on... ...any longer! Hey! Hey... please... Oh, God! Agh... Please... Please... help. Please... Oh, God... JEAN: Haul him up! Agh! Not a trace. Nothing. He's dead for certain. Shall we continue the search? Don't move or I'll shoot. (GRUNTS) Agh! Uh! (KNOCK AT DOOR) Come in. Please, they tell me... Go away! Please! I'll call the police! Madame Magloire, who's at the door? A beggar. A monster. What does he want? To kill us. I need help... food. Please, you will come inside. Madame Magloire, set another knife and fork for the guest. But, Monsieur... You are welcome here, my friend. Come in. I want you to put clean sheets upon the bed in the alcove. You mean, to sleep here? Yes. I think he could do with a good night's rest, hm? Monsieur, I beg you to consider... See to it at once. Well, my friend, perhaps you will wish to wash before supper? I can't pay for any of this. I have no money. And I would not take it if you did. You're more at home here than myself and all there is here is yours. But you... you don't even know who I am. Ah, but I do. You are my brother... ...and I can tell that you have suffered greatly. Even for a priest, you are different from the others. But... there are many more of them than there are of you. No man who is created good by God can be made entirely bad by man. There is always a spark... ...which evil can never extinguish. I don't know anything about that. I eat to live, that's all. It's enough for now. Madame Magloire, where are the silver plates we use for guests? (CLOCK STRIKES THREE) Monseigneur, the silver! It has gone! It has been stolen by that beggar. I told you. I warned you. That scoundrel, he took it in the night. Madame Magloire, I wrongfully held back the silver which belongs to the poor. And who was this person? Evidently a poor man. He is a thief. We must inform the police. (KNOCK AT DOOR) Oh, Lord help us! He has come back. He will kill us! Don't go to the door. (KNOCKING) Ah, Monseigneur. If you please, one moment. What? You're not a priest, then? Silence! He is a bishop. May we enter, Monseigneur? Indeed. I have been waiting for you. Come in. What a pleasant surprise! I am so happy to see you again, Monsieur. What's that? You have discovered, of course, that you forgot the candlesticks. Candlesticks? They are also silver and I think they should fetch you 200 francs at least. Why didn't you take them with you? I... Monseigneur, are you saying this man spoke the truth? We thought he was running away, but he claimed... Yes, I know. He told you that, ah, this silver had been given to him by a good priest. And so it was. You were mistaken. In that case, sir, we shall release him. Immediately. I know you gentlemen try to do your duty and I do not blame you... ...but you may retire now. Good day. You... Is it true? I'm free? Here. You will take these with you. No, I can't. Take them! Good. Now you will leave in peace. Father... Promise me. Promise that you will employ the money from this silver... ...in becoming an honest man. Do you hear me? And I promise you... ...that there is more joy in heaven over the face of a repentant sinner... ...than the white silk robes of a hundred just men. If you leave here with thoughts of hatred against your fellow man... ...then you're worthy of pity. But if you leave with thoughts of kindness and peace... ...oh, then you... ...you are more worthy than any of us. (SOBS) Go, my brother. For you no longer belong to evil. I've bought your soul. And I withdraw from it all black thoughts... ...and I give it to God. (FOLK MUSIC) (CHILDREN CHEERING AND LAUGHING) Who is that with Troufiat? It's the new police inspector. Another? That's all we need. As you can see, Inspector, you have arrived on a very special day. The fair is only held once a year. Many a pocket will be picked before the sun goes down. You have no police posted? The day of the fair... No, no. Go! The day of the fair people can do as they wish, within reason. You allow beggars, too? Today almost everything. The law does not allow for special days. A crime that is committed must be punished. Indeed, sir, we shall have to institute some changes when I take over. We have very little crime here, Inspector. It is a prosperous town. For that we can thank our good mayor Monsieur Madeline. You see? On the platform there. A truly wonderful man. I've seen enough here. Let's go. As you wish, Inspector. (GROWLING) (CHEERING) Hey, François, do you want a girl? You can have her cheap. You think I'm crazy? Put her in a kennel. Away with you! Yes. Is there anything else? Yes, you have a visitor to see you. Yes? He is the new inspector of police and he would like to introduce himself. Hm. Very well. Have him come in. You may come in, sir. Inspector Javert at your service, sir. How do you do? My privilege to serve you, Monsieur Le maire. I am your new inspector of police and I trust you never find me failing in my duty. Er... ...where have you served before this? I have been 21 years at Toulon prison. I became chief of the guards there. Well, I... We welcome you, Inspector. Is it possible, Monsieur... Have we met before? No. No? You have never been in Toulon? Never. And might I inquire when you may be free to inspect my men at headquarters? Inspect your men? In two short weeks, I have brought a new discipline to the department. We would be honored by a visit at your earliest convenience. Tomorrow perhaps? Oh, I am busy tomorrow. Friday? Very well, then. Thank you, sir. I will not take up any more of your time. Beads... Sir? You make beads here, I understand. Yes. Beads. How long has this man been mayor? Three years. Has he a family? No, he lives alone. That is, he has a housekeeper. Sister Simplice. A plain woman, but well known here because she never tells a lie! He attends no social events? Only in his duty as mayor. He keeps to himself. How long has he lived here? Five years. Where did he come from? I don't know, but we're all grateful he arrived. He brought with him this idea of using gum lac instead of rosin to make beads. It's so much cheaper that you can make twice as many at the same price. He has doubled the wages of the workers. We're prosperous now, thanks to him. Gum lac? Yes. Yes. It is quite plentiful in Toulon. In fact, they have used it there, I believe, in making... black beads. Close your mouth! I beg you. Have mercy... Quiet! What is this disturbance? Sorry, but this girl was soliciting in the street. No, I was just begging, that's all. She struck and insulted a gentleman. No, he struck me first. He called me names. Be quiet! I was just begging. Be quiet, I said! Sit over there. Sit. Make your report. Good afternoon. Monsieur Le maire... Would you inform Inspector Javert that I am here for... You are the one! I worked hard in your factory... ...but because I have a baby and no husband, you got rid of me! Who did? Who discharged you? The supervisor. Months ago! I have no money, nothing. Nothing to send to the people looking after my child. I sold my hair. I sold my body. I have nothing left to sell! (DOOR OPENS) Oh, Inspector, you will look after me, you will have mercy upon me. I would never strike a gentleman, but he was not... not a gentleman. Enough! Be quiet, woman. You have committed a crime and will have six months for it. But I was protecting myself. He struck me first! Six months! Oh, dear God! Dear God! Nor God nor anyone else can alter your sentence. Take her away. One moment, please. Sir? I would like this person to be set at liberty. Sir, that cannot be. Why so? The creature has struck and insulted a gentleman. I'm sorry. I have listened to this woman... ...and I know what I'm doing. My duty requires that she should go to prison for six months. Listen to me carefully. She will not go for a single day. I regret being forced to resist you, but I am within the limits of my authority. No! This affair belongs to the borough police. By the articles 9 and 11 of the Criminal Code, it falls under my jurisdiction. I order that she be set free at once! If you will permit me... Not another word! Sir. Leave the room! I knew nothing of what you told me. Here. This is to help with your child. You know nothing of me. I am a stranger to you. It was only a stranger... ...who held out a hand to me once. Let me know if you have any more trouble. (MOANING) Agh! How did it happen? The mud. He tried to free the cart, but it sank and he fell. Now he's trapped underneath. Have you no jack? Someone's gone for one, but I don't think he'll last that long. Some of you start unloading the cart. You, come. Use this log as a lever under the axle. You'll be killed! Come out! It's coming up. Quick! Grab him! What is your name? Fauchelevent. Fauchelevent. Take him to my carriage. Oh, bless you... Oh, bless you... I believe I could prove it in court. You believe? That is all? He is Jean Valjean, no question. Mm. For your own sake, Monsieur, you had better be right. Sir? We shall make our own investigation first, and inform you if... ...if the accusation is justified. That is all. Monsieur? Hm? There's a young woman at the door. She says you gave her money for her child and she must see you. Oh, show her in. Monsieur... Monsieur... forgive me. I don't want to bother you, but I have no place else to go. They want more money. They are demanding it. Who? The Thenardiers. The innkeepers who are looking after my little girl till I can send for her. They now tell me she is very ill and they must have money for medicine. What am I to do? We shall send them a note, and we shall send them money... ...and ask them to bring the child at once. But, Monsieur, they won't... Not another word. It's done. And, meanwhile... ...we shall see if there's some work suitable for you to do at the factory. Sister Simplice! She has fainted. Oh, the poor child. (KNOCK AT DOOR) JAVERT: Good evening, Sister. Is Monsieur Le maire at home? He's in the study. Please, come in. Forgive me for interrupting you, sir. Not at all. I will come straight to the point. I am sorry to report that an inferior officer has failed you in the gravest manner. I am here, as is my duty, to bring that fact to your knowledge. And who is this officer? Myself. I request that you procure my dismissal at once. I could have sent in my resignation, but that is not enough. I have done wrong and I deserve punishment. I must be dismissed. Please, sit down. You were severe to me at headquarters unjustly. Be so justly now. You wish to be dismissed. Why? What have you done? Three weeks ago I took the occasion to go to Paris to see the prefect of police there... ...and to denounce you. As a mayor who has encroached upon the authority of the police? No, I denounced you... ...as an escaped convict. In truth, I thought you were. I have had these... notions for some time. A certain resemblance to a man called... Jean Valjean. It may sound absurd, I know, but I took you for him all the same... ...and I denounced you to the prefect. And what was the response you received? At first they were uncertain, and then they told me I was mad. They were right. You admit you were mistaken? Indeed. For, you see, sir, the real Jean Valjean has been found. Oh? Yes. The police are certain they have caught him at Arras. He will be tried and when his identity is proven... ...he will be returned to prison for the rest of his life. Arras, you say. Yes. The trial takes place there tomorrow. And now, Monsieur, I ask that you dismiss me from service. You exaggerate your error. Having heard your story, I would like you to remain as inspector. Don't you understand, Monsieur? There are two classes of people. Those who attack society and those who guard it. We are the guardians and I have failed in my duty. My own father... ...spent time in prison. Indeed, that is where I was born. The laws of society can never be ignored. Very well. We'll see. No. A gentleman ought not give his hand to a spy. Good evening, sir. I-I will continue in my duty until my place is filled. MAN: Monsieur Valjean, do you have anything further to say? I am innocent. I am not Jean Valjean. You have heard the evidence of these three men. These men all served with you at Toulon prison... ...and each one has identified you as Jean Valjean. How can you pretend otherwise? My name is Lebec. I am a wheelwright. You are indeed a very clever fellow to have so many names. They are mistaken. I have always been a wheelwright. It's a hard trade. At 40, a man is finished. And I am telling the truth. You need only inquire. I do not know what you want of me. The truth! Your name! Lebec. When I was a boy they called me "Little". Now I am called "Old". And I have never stolen anything. Why is everyone so spiteful against me? I am not the man you seek! The defendant is correct. Look at me. Don't you recognise me? Monsieur Le Président... ...I ask you to acquit this prisoner. He's not the man you seek. I am the convict, Jean Valjean. (CROWD GASPS) (BANGS GAVEL) Monsieur, we have met before. You are the Mayor of Monteis sur Monteis. Have you taken leave of your senses? You are on the verge of committing a great error. I'm the only man who sees clearly here, and I speak the truth. Brevet... ...don't you remember me? I remember you. Call to mind the chequered suspenders you wore as a prisoner. Chenildieu... ...you have on your left shoulder a deep burn... ...over the letters TFP. Isn't that so? And, Cochepaille... ...you have on your right arm a date made in blue letters... ...with burnt gunpowder. And I, gentlemen... I have my prison identification. (CROWD GASPS) (JUDGE BANGS GAVEL) I will not occupy the time of this court any longer. The Public Prosecutor knows who I am and where I live. I presume that all of you here think me worthy of pity. But, great God, when I think I was on the point of doing nothing... ...I consider myself worthy of envy. Still, I should have preferred that none of this had happened. Monsieur... It's all right. My little one. She is with you? My angel. Soon. You'll see her soon... ...but you must get better first. No, please. Just to look at her. She is pretty? Please, I must see her, please... (COUGHS) There now, you see? You mustn't excite yourself. You have to try to rest. Dear God, save me! It's all right. Don't be frightened. He hasn't come for you. I know what you want. Then, make haste! I said come with me! Monsieur Le maire! There is no Monsieur Le maire in this room. There is only a scoundrel. Inspector... Monsieur. Monsieur the inspector now! A word in private... Speak up! People talk aloud to me! I ask you to give me three days to go and fetch the child of this poor woman. I'll pay whatever you want. And if you don't trust me, come with me. You think me a fool who can be bought? Three days in which you can bolt? To pretend that you would fetch this creature's brat! Oh, that is fine! Fine! Cosette! Oh, dear God, my child! My Cosette... Monsieur... Monsieur Le maire. Be quiet, wench! You think a streetwalker can be nursed like royalty? No more! There is no more Monsieur Le maire! You have killed this woman. There are guards without. Come quickly or they will take you by force. I advise you to let me be for a moment! My solemn vow. My sacred promise. The child will be cared for. Now, sir, I am at your service. (GUNSHOT) Get down there! Nothing, Inspector. Not a sign. Keep searching. Yes, sir. (KNOCK AT DOOR) Monsieur Madeline! (PANTING) Duval. Four men to come with me at once. Here, come here. Take this to pay for a proper burial. The rest you may use as you wish. But, Monsieur, where will you go? I can't tell you. If I did, you'd have to tell them... ...and I don't want to put you in a position where you're forced to betray me. It's better you... (HORSE NEIGHS) Listen. They're coming. They're moving all round the house. (KNOCKING) I must hide. But where? (KNOCKING) Inspector! It's very late! Will you step away from the door, please, Sister? Yes, of course. Where is Monsieur Le maire? Are you deaf, Sister? Where is Monsieur Le maire? I do not know. You're alone in the house? Must I ask every question twice? I'm alone. It is my understanding that you have never told a falsehood. Never! Then, forgive me for asking, but it is my duty. You have not seen the man who calls himself Mr. Madeline within the last hour? No! I must humbly beg your pardon, then. (CREAKING) God bless you, Sister. I've lied! And may this falsehood be placed to your credit in paradise. God be with you, Monsieur. Indeed. (SCRUBBING) You, Miss Toad! More water now! But it's dark. Now! You wish lodging for the night, Monsieur? No. I would like to speak to your husband, Madame. About what? About the child you have living with you. Cosette. What has she done now? Rest assured, Monsieur. She will be punished. Hm. Is she a problem for you? I cannot even beat an honest day's work out of her. Hm. How would you like to be rid of her? May I be of some assistance, Monsieur? Er, the gentleman wants to take the little toad away with him. Toad? Cosette. What are you talking about? How can you think like that? Oh, no, I'm sorry, Monsieur. That's impossible. You see, ah... ...I adore the child. Don't I, my dear? We're really very attached to her. Hm. I mean, of course, to offer you money for her. You can put your money away, Monsieur. I can't consent to that! We brought the child up. We couldn't part with her. Oh, yes, my wife is quick with her sometimes, but she loves her, too. You won't accept money, then. Well, we are very poor, Monsieur, but... Well, I can't just give the child up to the first passer-by, unless... Yes? We'd have to know where she's going... ...so we could see her from time to time. 500 francs. But when we leave here, you will not see her again. No, I'm sorry. The sacrifice is too great. Unless... Yes! Well, if you could see your way to make it 1,000 francs. Done. Here. And we will never meet again! I brought this for you. We're going to Paris, to the largest city in the world. 1,000 francs for the little baggage. Imagine! Imbecile. Stupid! Stupid! He would have given 15,000 francs. Who is this man - Thenardier? He is the manager of an inn. He and his wife. Does he know where they've gone? He followed them to the road out of town. One that could lead them here to Paris. I request a transfer here at once. And you think you can find him? If he is here, I will find him. (CLOCK STRIKES) (TWO MORE KNOCKS) Good. You did exactly what I told you to do. Never open unless you hear two more knocks. Now... ...because you're such a good pupil... ...we're going to start our lessons. Lessons? Yes. Reading. But I can't read. Exactly! That's why I'm going to teach you. We've covered the entire quartier Poullard, here. Cover it again... and again. And then the quartier Mouffetard. You'll find that most thieves are not attracted to the quartier Mouffetard. Jean Valjean is not "most thieves". Do it. (KNOCKING) MAN: Are you in charge? WOMAN: Yes. We're looking for an escaped convict. He has a little girl with him. He may be hiding in this area. If you see anyone of this description... ...please notify us. I will, Monsieur. His name is Jean Valjean, but he may use the name Madeline. I understand. Wake up, my child. What is it? We must leave here at once. Where are we going? Sh. Are you leaving, Monsieur? Oh, ah... a little morning walk. My angel and I. Tell me, did I see the police here a while ago? They are looking for someone. They may question you as you leave. Oh, I see. Quickly! Quickly! The gentleman and the child have left the house! (DOG BARKS) Listen to me carefully. You mustn't cry. You must be very brave. Yes. Now, you understand... ...when I get to the top of the roof, you come stand over here. All right? JAVERT: You, search that alley. He must be here somewhere! You take the one on the right. Open this door! Open! This is the police! Open the door! This is the police! Do you think he climbed the wall? Alone, there's a chance. But with the girl, never. Nothing. Nothing at all. But he's here. He's got to be! (SIGHS) Establish a watch on the neighbourhood until further notice. At once, Inspector. Monsieur. (GASPS) Please, have no fear. I have no wish to harm you. It's... It's Monsieur Madeline. How do you know me? You do not remember me? You pulled me out from under the cart. Do you remember? I'm Fauchelevent. Fauchelevent. Ah, Fauchelevent. What are you doing here? Oh, I'm working here in the convent. You must have fallen out of the sky. Convent? You're a man, Monsieur. How did you get in? Oh, no matter. My purpose now is to stay here. But you must understand, Monsieur... ...the sisters can't afford to employ anybody else. Oh, I wouldn't want to be paid. I'd do the work for nothing... ...ah, just to stay here, with my little one, of course. I'll speak to the Mother Prioress, but, ah, I don't know what I'm going to tell her. Well, tell her that you have a brother, newly arrived... ...and that you want him to help you with the work. A brother. I'll do it. You are the brother? He is, Reverend Mother. What is your name? Ultime Fauchelevent, Reverend Mother. You are a gardener? Er... Oh, yes, he is, Reverend Mother. Are you a good Christian? Oh, yes, he is, Reverend Mother. And this little girl is yours? Yes, she is, Reverend Mother. He answers well. Yes... Oh, thank you, Reverend Mother. That will be all. Monsieur, the child. She will stay now with us. Don't be frightened, my child. They'll take good care of you. And I... I'll never be far away. The transfer will be effective immediately. The district of Le Busse. Monsieur, I beg to remind you, we have not yet caught the fugitive Jean Valjean. He is still at large. We do have other considerations. Foremost among them is the rate of crime in Le Busse. But if we stop the search now, he may slip through our fingers. Inspector, I order you to the district of Le Busse! Do you attempt to argue with me? Never, sir. You leave tomorrow morning. That is all. Monsieur! Well, what is it now? I will never give up the search for Jean Valjean. If it takes me the rest of my life, I will find him. And that is a sacred promise. (CHOIR SINGING) Monsieur? Reverend Mother. Have you thought it over? Have you searched your heart, Monsieur? I have... ...but I have not changed my mind. Her education here is complete now, and for that I am greatly indebted to you. But I feel, now that she has grown... ...she has a right to... know the life outside before renouncing it. (SINGING CONTINUES) I tell you quite frankly, Monsieur... ...that she is a bright child and obviously quite comely. We shall miss her very much. I can well understand that... ...and, after all, having taken care of her as you have... ...I would like to offer a gift to the convent. The sum of 5,000 francs. Monsieur... Oh, ah, a sum that I inherited. Please, accept it from me with my gratitude. I will see that Cosette gets her things ready. And I say to you, down with the Bourbons. Why do we need a king? Parasites. Down with the Bourbons. Down with the monarchy. Destroy the Restoration. Create a new government. You! Join us today! Together we will lay our hand on the sword hilt of God and shout... ..."Down with the Bourbons! Down with the monarchy!" We can do it. Only together can we bring these murderers to their knees. We are advancing. We shall be victorious, we shall not despair. What can we fear? We have brains that dream, heads that talk, passions that burn... Come along, Cosette. ..and miseries that yell freedom! Death to the King! Death to the monarchy! Long live the people! Cosette! I don't understand. What have they done? Quickly! Take up their arms! Their swords! Join us! Join us! (SHOUTING) But why? Why do the police want to arrest them? Because they're revolutionary. They want to destroy the monarchy. Is the monarchy bad? Well, it doesn't listen to the poor. It never has. But it commands the French army. To fight it is useless. Will he... I mean, will they come back to the park? I doubt that anything will stop them until they're killed. MAN: You are now official agents of the government. You will no longer wear police uniforms... ...until the leaders of this insurrection are apprehended. I want you to infiltrate every district... ...question anyone who has a knowledge of these traitors. Find the ringleaders and bring them in. Or, if they resist... ...shoot them on the spot. Inspector, you are assigned the district of Dieufit. Abrets, the district of Lamastre. Breous, the district of Ventavon. Father, it's such a nice day. May we go to the park? The park? If you wish. The human race is rising. The lower strata will come out from all its distress. We are advancing. We shall be victorious. We, who believe, what can we fear? We have brains that dream, heads that talk, passions that burn... ...souls that suffer and miseries that yell freedom! Freedom! What are we? We are all nameless men. Men of wretchedness and nothingness. Bare arms, bare feet. But a man who has in his soul the secret to vote against repression belongs to us! We are lifted by the whirlwind. We shall make a cannonball of stone, a general of a porter. Riot... ...insurrection... His name's Enjolras. He may be speaking for others, but we believe he leads them. That is our duty. So I say to you again today... ...death to the King! Death to the monarchy! Long live the people! What do we want? An end of oppression! The end of tyranny! The end of the sword... Gavroche, look. Do you see her? Who? The bright angel. Follow her and find out where she lives. How much do you give me? I'll give you a swift kick if you don't follow her. Cosette, come along now. Quickly. She is leaving. Do you want him taken in? Not yet. The other one, the young one. Marius is the name. He lives alone. Perhaps if we questioned him... My God! What is it? Alive! What are you talking about? Stay here. Did you see a gentleman go by here with a pretty young lady? Monsieur, I do not speak to strangers. I am Chief Inspector Javert of Mouffetard. Did you see them? Yes, Monsieur. Just a moment ago. Where did they go? Up there. To the end of the park. (CHURCH BELLS) Father? (MARIUS) I wait without. Please do not send me away. I cannot live as I was. I cannot go on without speaking to you. I am your devoted servant. What is your name? Marius. I am Cosette. Mademoiselle... ...you are paradise... ...and I will never be the same again. Good morning, Father. What a beautiful morning. Sit down, Cosette. I have something to tell you. Oh, but must you look so serious about it? It's a serious matter. Well? I'm afraid, ah, we must leave Paris for a while. Leave? Why? Er, it's getting too dangerous for us. The insurrection is growing every day. But surely it's nothing. They'll be fighting in the streets. It's not safe for us here. Where would we go? London... perhaps for a year. You know I've always done what's best for us. You can't. Dear God, you can't! There must be some way. You could follow me. I have no money. Cosette, you can't leave me now. There's no choice. I owe everything in the world to him. I swear by all that is holy, if you leave here now, I will die. Excuse me, sir. Your grandson is here. Marius? Yes, sir. Will you receive him? Well, what is it you want, young man? Sir... Come to your senses at last, have you? Come to ask my forgiveness, I suppose? No, sir. I wish you to take pity on me, sir. Pity? You who takes sides with the scum of the streets... ...against the government, the monarchy, your family? You expect to receive pity from me? Hm! I am aware that my presence here displeases you, sir. So that's what you think! But I have come to ask just one thing of you and then I shall go away at once. Don't be a fool, boy. Who said anything about going away? Why don't you ask for my forgiveness, eh? Why don't you come here and embrace me? You broke my heart, you know? At times I've been glad your parents died before you could break their hearts, too. Well, what is it you want of me? Speak up, man. I have come to ask your permission to marry. Marry. Oh, so you have a profession? You learnt a trade and are earning your living? I-I tutor in science as often as I can, but, no, I don't have a weekly income. Indeed. Then I presume the young woman is wealthy. No, sir. I shall need money. Oh, you will, will you? Well... ...here you are. There's 20 Louis for you and you can buy yourself a hat! But please, sir... Why don't you leave the ridiculous life you're leading with this rabble... ...and come back to us? Her father means to take her to England and I need money to follow. Just enough money to go to England. Oh, if only you knew how wonderful she is and how much I love her. Well, if that's the case, my dear boy, why not make the silly girl your mistress? Marius! Come back! Marius! Marius... Marius! Why are you so unhappy? Ah... Doesn't she love you? Go away! Are you so unhappy that you can desert them now? What? What are you talking about? They've started fighting. They've built a barricade. Where? On the rue St Denis. Wait! I'll go with you. (GUNFIRE) Agh! Agh! Agh! Agh! Stay here. No! Stay here! Hold your fire! Marius! Cannon! They've brought a cannon! Fire! (SCREAMING) Long live the Republic! I thought I told you to stay away! Down with the Bourbons. I fight like anyone else. Quickly! We have a spy! A spy? Yes. I've seen him before. He even told me who he was. Who are you, Monsieur? What is your name? Javert. He is Javert. Who is Javert? The chief inspector of the quartier Mouffetard. Well, Monsieur I'inspecteur... I have the honour of telling you you will be shot just before the barricade is taken. Why not at once? We have to save our gunpowder. Your time will come, as it will for all of us. (SCREAMING) Gavroche, take this letter to 16 rue de Talliard. It's urgent! But... I know you want to die with us... ...but your death won't save the Republic. Live to fight in other ways. Now go! (KNOCK AT DOOR) Come in. Come in. Come in, come in. What is it? Er... ...I have a message for Cosette. Oh, for Cosette. Well, I'm her father. You can give it to me. But he told me only to give it to Cosette. Who? Who told you? Marius. Marius? Oh, yes, of course. Er... It's all right, then. Here. N-no, no, no. I do this for Marius. Wait. Where is he now, this Marius? On the rue St Denis, at the barricade. They are fighting. Now? I go back to join them. You? That's ridiculous. Long live the Republic! (GUNFIRE) (NEIGHING) Agh! Fire! Agh! Charge! He can't make it. They'll kill him! Gavroche! Get back! Get back! It's no use. They'll kill you, too! No! Don't shoot! He's a loyalist. Do you know him? His name is Monsieur Madeline. I'll vouch for him. MAN: Hold your fire! Hold your fire! Why have you come here? I came to take your place. It's a fool's errand. I couldn't leave if I wanted to. Unless you surrender. It's out of the question. If all we can offer them are our corpses, we'll do it, but you've walked into a trap. They've seen you join us. You're one of us now. (GUNFIRE) I should have known. The scoundrel joins up with the fools. How did you come... I'm a troublesome spy. You needn't be concerned. They will blow out my brains shortly. And you, I suppose, will be certain to watch. You are welcome to. How much longer can you hold? We will not survive the next attack. I want to ask a favour of you. Well? Let me be the one... to kill the spy. As you wish, but I will not have his rotten corpse near ours. Take him to the Montrachet corner. The barricade's lower there. Be done with it. Well, go on. Take your revenge. I am waiting. Oh, a knife. Of course, that suits a cutthroat better. Turn around! You're free. Begone! You madden me. I would sooner be killed! I said begone! Fire! (DISTANT GUNFIRE) (WATER DRIPPING) He must be here. No, nothing. You can see for yourself. And the roof? It collapsed in the cannon fire. Then where? Where? Étienne... ...bring some men at once. MAN: Bring some torches! You and you, there! Halt! Why did you let me go? I had no choice. Choice? Once... ...many years ago... ...a remarkable man... bought my soul. He removed from it all evil thoughts... ...and gave it to God. There is no God. There is only the law. Guilt and innocence... ...do not exist outside the law. If that is what you believe... ...then you must kill me. Kill me now. Turn around. Javert? Javert! (ECHOES) In nomine Patris, et Filii... ...et Spiritus Sancti. Amen. Thank you for coming. I've been a fool. Oh, sir... ...we're all fools most of our lives. It's unavoidable.
