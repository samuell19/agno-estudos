DON: You're looking at Hong Kong, my home since the end of World War II. I have a neon sign hanging in the heart of this international city that says "Don Benton, Travel Agency". Don Benton, that's my name. And the travel agency? That's my business. And into this modest establishment of mine flock all the ingredients of civilisation, from royalty to impostors, from the cream of society to the dregs of the gutters. And Hong Kong makes room for them all, and that makes it just about the most exciting city in the world. From the luxury villas on the peak down to the narrow streets off the waterfront, the place is a hive, humming with human energy. Three million people jostle together on a rock off the mainland of Red China, every one engaged in a fierce personal pursuit. Of what? Food, money, pleasure, love... maybe even a little information. And for me, Hong Kong's a city where my wartime know-how earns me a buck or two. My travel agency will land you with speed, courtesy and comfort, at any place in South East Asia, so long as its rulers don't happen to dislike your face, or, er... or your politics. These days, some of them can be kind of choosy. Miss? Is Mr Benton in? - No. In soon. - Okay, I'll wait. WOMAN #1: Don't they want tourists in Indonesia? All those forms and photographs. We've put them in, we've paid the fees. - And what fees! Anybody would think... - It is the consulate, madam. They say very sorry, cannot issue visas until you have airline tickets. Say, do you mean to say that you haven't got the tickets either? Airline says, very sorry, cannot issue tickets without visas. - Very difficult for us, madam. - WOMAN #1: Difficult for you? - SWEE KIM: Please, madam... - WOMAN #1: Oh, good morning, Mr Benton. Hello. Everything all right? Sure, except for your friends in the Indonesian consulate. - We planned to leave today. - Oh, visa trouble, eh? Well, it's a little difficult to rush these people. Rush? It's been three weeks. Well, these young republics, I'm afraid they're apt to wear their brand new independence like a brand new suit. I guess we were pretty much the same in Washington a couple of hundred years ago. - Yes, but we weren't on vacation then. - Mmm. Er... Swee Kim, call in Hussein. He's one of our drivers. He's an Indonesian with relatives in the consulate. I'm sure if you send him back in with a little present, er... about twenty dollars ought to do it, you'll have your visas back within an hour. (CHUCKLING) Oh, thank you. Thank you very much. Could I speak to you in private, Mr Benton? - About a tour? - Well, could be. Something a little off the beaten track. Well, sure. Have a seat. "Chungking, 1938." Tough enemy, the Japs. Mmm, very. In those days, flying was still fun. At least we flew aircraft, not electronic computers. "From Chula of Thai to a good friend of the country." The Prince seems to regard you as a hero. I was able to advise him on his jade collection. Now, just what can I do for you, Mr, um...? Johnson. Sam Johnson. Ah, yes. You came in via Manila. I see you keep an eye on the arrivals. Well, travel is our business, Mr Johnson. - Besides, we have an office there. - And good connections elsewhere, I'm told. We manage to cover most of the ports out here. No, I meant personal connections. Weren't you a friend of Lee Huan Ho, the scholar, up in Shanghai? Well, don't hold that against the poor man. He's dead. Yeah. I gather he wasn't very happy under the new r√©gime. And Father Rodriguez, who had the mission at Amoy. Just how do you happen to know all this? Oh, through mutual friends. To be frank, I've heard a lot about you. You've been in China a long time, Mr Benton. You flew with General Chennault's Flying Tigers, ferrying munitions and food for the Chinese. In our war, you fought the Japs again in the Pacific. You speak Cantonese and, I believe, Malay. Your knowledge of the Chinese and their customs is, shall we say, unusual? Suppose we cut the build-up, Mr Johnson? Just what are you trying to sell me? Well, let's say an idea that you should meet a friend of mine. - Someone who wants your help. - (KNOCKING) Tai Ko. Man shui. To chieh nei Swee Kim. But I'm busy now. When feet's happy, mind calm for contemplation. (CHUCKLING) This is my sister. - Oh? - It seems it's my birthday. I'm commanded to live ten thousand years. - Sure. - SWEE KIM: You like? DON: Yes, Swee Kim. I like them very much. Now, leave the tea things and run along. I've a visitor. - Cheng yum cha? - Oh, thanks. It's a little Chinese custom. You don't have to drink it. You were saying? I was speaking about my friend. Ah, yes, the, er... the guy that wants to meet me. Well, why doesn't he come here? Well, it's a very confidential matter, Mr Benton. He felt it would be better discussed elsewhere. But first he wanted confirmation of a few small facts. Oh, he does, does he? Well, I'll confirm a few for him right now. I'm a travel agent, and my business isn't so darned confidential - that it can't be talked out loud. - (BUZZER) - Good morning, Mr Johnson. - (DOOR OPENING) (DOOR CLOSING) - Tai Ko, man shui. - Oh, thank you, Swee Lim. Another sister? This gentleman was just leaving. Sir Arthur Cragg has called, Tai Ko. He wants to see you about his reservation for his holiday in the Philippines. Oh, well, er... call him back and tell him I'll bring the schedule myself. I'll, er... be on the next train for the peak. - You still here, Mr Johnson? - I'm on my way. But you'll hear from us again. Probably from my chief, Mr Orme. And, er... I'll need a car. (LAUGHING) Tai Ko, your shoe! (BOTH LAUGHING) DON: My business with Sir Arthur took me to his villa on the peak, where the homes of the rich Taipans command one of the finest views in Asia. It had been a pleasant break from the heat and bustle of the port, and I was sorry to have to return. Hello. The air's so good up here at the peak, it seems a shame to have to go down to the city, you know. Oh, yes. Oh, excuse me. That's a fine view, Mr Benton. Finest in the world. Er... have we met before? No, not in the flesh, but Orme's the name. Charles Orme, of Washington DC. Oh. I see. Yeah, I thought you would. Have you read this morning's paper? "Mystery of missing Formosan plane." - I've read it. - Interesting bit of news. - To some, maybe. - (CHUCKLING) Oh, to lots of people. And most certainly to us. Us? Well, er... shall we say, to a certain department of the US Government? You can guess why. I'm a punk guesser, Mr Orme. Well, strictly between ourselves, we're concerned about this missing plane. Why? Isn't that more a matter for the nationalist Chinese in Formosa? Oh, it concerns us, too. That's why I'm so happy to meet you. I don't get you, Mr Orme. - Well, I believe you can help us. - How? There's someone aboard that plane whose safety is, er... well, important to the West. All I know is what everybody else knows. There was a typhoon, and radio contact was lost, just before the plane disappeared. It was off course. Last indications were that it was heading for Canton. It may have landed on the mainland. Have you tried to contact the airport in Canton? Hong Kong's been calling them ever since the plane was reported overdue. A sheer waste of time. - Especially if the, er... - If it was forced down. Mm-hmm. Well, why do you come to me? Because you have contacts, Mr Benton. Contacts in many places. - Perhaps even in Canton. - Oh. You mean, er... undercover work, hmm? Sorry, I leave that to the authorities. Mr Orme, I'm a businessman. I can't get involved in anything political, anything that might prejudice my relations with the Communist government, such as they are. It's our country's interests we're discussing, Mr Benton. Hong Kong is my home. I can't afford to endanger the position I've built up here. - Tai Ko. Cho chei. - Cho chei ah yik. (CHUCKLING) I'd offer you a lift, but the family requires my presence. - The family? - Yeah. His family, and mine. DON: I wasn't kidding, either. It was a Chinese family I'd come to know and love during the war against the Japanese. In those bad old days, we helped each other many times. Now, they called me "son", and in their family affairs, I was as much involved as in my own. - (SUDDEN NOISE) - (CHUCKLING) How're you doing, old boy, huh? (CHUCKLING) Here, sit over here. And here's your rations, okay? - Tai Ko! - Oh, hi, darling! How are you, huh? Huh? Hard at it? What's all this now, hmm? "The brain. The seat of the intellect." Grandmother doesn't agree. She says the seat of the intellect is in the stomach. She's a wise woman. Where is she? In the garden, waiting for you. (BIRDS CHIRPING) Morning, Mother. You wanted to talk with me? - Man sui sing shang. - (CHUCKLING) Even the servants won't let me forget I'm a year older today. Another year more foolish. Still without a son. You mean without a wife to give me a son. Did you send for me to tell me that again? No. You will know something about flying ship that lost its way? Oh, the Formosan plane? No, none of my passengers were aboard. Passengers! You think of passengers! What about your brother? Jimmy? Was he the pilot? Last night sampan man come in with message from river people. Jimmy's fly-ship down near Chinan Fu. Oh. Well, then Johnson was right. That island's way up the estuary near Canton. That's Red territory. Is Jimmy safe? Message come from Jimmy. He say river people pick him up, hiding him in hut outside fishing village. Mm-hmm. And the others? No can tell. Nobody open mouth. Well, he's among friends. But they'll need money. They'll probably try to smuggle him aboard a junk to get him out. Money no good. Junk people plenty scared. Too many boats in river. Gunboats and patrols. I know. And if they're caught with a Formosan officer aboard... Gunboats, no gunboats, must get Jimmy home. Yes, we must. But how? You fix it. I fix it? Just have the office write him out a ticket, just like that, huh? Somebody must go. Yes. Somebody. Not you, Tai Ko. You do too much for us too many times already. Now look, Tai Tai. A long time ago, when a certain crazy flier was in trouble, who was it took him in and fed him? Who risked their lives to hide him from the Japanese? Remember? Long time ago. Bad time. Best be forgotten. Not by me, old mother. That sampan man, where is he? In kitchen sleeping. Last night he come. I give him pork and rice. Him very sick at stomach. Poor devil. He needed it, I guess. Well, give him some more, because I'm going to need him and his boat. Don't worry, Mother. I'll... I'll bring Jimmy home. Take care. I don't want to lose two sons. Good sailing weather, Mr Benton. I think we'll be there in about five hours. That means we'll get home early morning, huh? - Think so. - Good. (MOTOR CHUGGING) (INSECTS CHIRRUPING) (DISTANT SHOUTING) (MOTOR SHUTTING OFF) (SHOUTING) (WOMAN LAUGHING) Oh! (GIGGLING) (MOTOR CHUGGING) - Chinan Fu? - Hai, Chinan Fu. Stop engines. (DISTINCTIVE WHISTLE) (WHISTLING) Tai Ko! Wait there! Don! Don! Quick, the engines! Don! (GUNSHOTS) Come on, Jimmy. This side. (GUNSHOTS) - Here, Jimmy. All right? - Pretty good. Ah Hong, let's get out of here. Sure I was decoyed. The radio bearing I received showed me dead on course for Hong Kong, ninety miles south. And there I was, over Canton. Next thing I knew, two MiGs were on my tail, ordering me to land. Why didn't you? (CHUCKLING) Maybe I was annoyed. Anyway, I saw some low cloud over the estuary, and dived for it. Thought I'd made it, too, but they'd knocked out my port engine. Had to make a belly landing on the water. Anybody hurt? No, don't think so. And before you could say "Reds", the place was thick with launches. Waiting, I expect. They took everybody off, only three passengers and the crew, and sank the plane. I saw it. Who were the passengers? Two men and a woman. - American? - Mmm, one of the men, I think. Where were you? In the drink. Soon as I saw what they were up to, I went overboard. They... didn't they see you? Sure. Kissed me goodbye, too, with a drum of tracer bullets. I dived again. I swam for what seemed like hours. In the end, I got tangled in a fishing net. It belonged to the old man from Chinan Fu. They brought me to the island, and hid me in that deserted hut. - They're brave people in that village. - Yes. Well, you'd better try to get some sleep. We'll be in in the early morning. (SHIP'S HORN) For Ah Hong. He deserves it. Good to see Hong Kong again. - See, when this story gets around... - It mustn't get around. Not till we know what the authorities have to say. I'll contact your HQ in Formosa. Meantime, better not talk to anyone. Better for whom? Better for all concerned, including you. I'm taking you straight home. (CHILDREN LAUGHING) Jimmy! Hello, Jimmy! Thank you, Tai Ko. For taking Jimmy on a fishing trip? Oh. Well, what has Tai Tai told you? Nothing. But when you had left, Swee Lim and I saw her burning joss sticks to Kwan Yin, praying for her sons. So all night, we prayed too, for our brothers. Thank you, Swee Kim. I guess she must have heard you. Goddess of mercy always hears. One day you will see, when your wife asks her for a son. Well, she'll have to provide me with a wife first, Swee Kim. Perhaps I ask her that, too. Tai Ko, Tai Ko, come and play with us. Well, here we are, Mother. Safe and sound, and very hungry. MAO: Good. Sorry to give you too much worry, Grandmother. Better say sorry to Tai Ko. Yes, Grandmother. Come here. Jimmy, you been in trouble? Plenty trouble, until Tai Ko came to find me. Not that. I mean deep trouble No. Is anything the matter? Soon we'll see. Oh, hello, Inspector. Come to join the family reunion? I'm afraid not, Mr Benton. I'm here on official business. With this man. Just arrived in Hong Kong? - Sure. Landed from a... - Sampan, early this morning? Well, of course he did. He came with me. I'm sorry, Mr Benton. Leave this to me, please. - What is your name? - Mao Chi Mei. Jimmy to my friends. Captain, Chinese Nationalist Air Force. Any papers? Something to identify yourself? I can identify him. I've known him ever since he was... Mr Benton, please. Well? No, I haven't. I crash-landed in the estuary two nights ago. Everything I had is at the bottom of the river. Then I'm afraid you'll have to come with me. This is ridiculous. All you've got to do is call up Air Control, and they'll verify the... We know that, Mr Benton. I shouldn't try to interfere, if I were you. Come on, young man. Okay, okay, I'll come. This is a damn fool silly mistake. No hurry, please. They come long way, no food yet in belly. Very good roast duck in oven. Plenty for Inspector, too. It's no use, Tai Tai. He has to go. Police all same. Just like... Ah, now, now, Mother, don't worry. I... I'll get these things changed, and go down and see what I can do about it. Must eat first. Flowers of wisdom spring from well-filled stomach. Yeah, but an empty belly sharpens the tongue. (CHATTERING) What's going on in here, Taylor? Didn't take you long to get here, Mr Benton. No, it didn't take me long to get here, but you kept me waiting long enough. I'm sorry. What can I do for you? Hmm! You know very well what you can do for me. Release Jimmy Mao. Where's the Superintendent? ORME: One moment, Mr Benton. You told me only yesterday that you didn't want to become involved in matters of this kind. So perhaps it might be better if you just stayed uninvolved. Well, when you approached me, I didn't know that Jimmy Mao was the pilot of that plane. That makes a difference? I've known him and his family for many years, and so have most of the members of your police force. Any case, you can't hold him without a definite charge. Quite true. There is a charge. Of what? Opium smuggling. Jimmy Mao an opium smuggler? That's a darned fool suggestion, and you know it. What are you trying to pin on him? We've arrested Mao for his own protection. If his story checks, then it's essential the Reds don't learn of his escape. Well, you've picked the quickest way to tell them. We think not. No-one would connect Huan Ling Foo, held for a smuggling offence, with the Nationalist pilot, Captain Mao. I came to tell you that, if Mao was not released immediately, I was going to hire the best lawyer in Hong Kong to defend him. But, before I decide to play it your way, perhaps you'll tell me what's behind all this. I brought him out, remember? I think you can rely on Mr Benton's discretion, Mr Orme. Thank you, Inspector. You know that we had a courier aboard that plane carrying information important to the West. Indeed, in a certain field, vitally important. What field are we in? Shall we say "scientific"? Now you'll understand why it's essential that we find out what happened to that courier. TAYLOR: And how it happened. Jimmy says he was decoyed. Do you think he was lying? Lying or not, the indications are that the other side knew what that plane was carrying. And, if the operation was planned ahead, it suggests a further possibility. Connivance by the pilot. Oh, Jimmy wouldn't work with the Reds. TAYLOR: I hope you're right. Meanwhile, as you'll appreciate, he's safer in custody. All right. I won't fight it. Yet. Erm... you wanted me to help you. Thanks, Benton, but everything's under control. The Service is pursuing its own investigations. Hmm. In that case... - You realise, of course, that... - Oh, don't worry. I'll keep my mouth shut. Tai Ko. Tai Tai. (DOOR LATCH CLICKING) Not good. You see Jimmy? No. And you're not to try to see him either, till I tell you. Police all same. Make big trouble because Jimmy had accident. Well, some people think maybe it wasn't an accident. Not the police. The Superintendent's on our side. You give him present? Maybe he want more? - No matter. - (CHUCKLING) No, Mother, no. Nobody wants a present. They... they want proof. - (BUZZER) - And proof is somewhere up that river. So? Oh, Swee Kim, I'm leaving for the mainland. Not Canton? No, no, the doorstep to Canton. Otherwise, a routine visit to our office in Macao. Wire Pereira to meet me at the boats. Hong Kong... Macao... Canton. To clear Jimmy's name, I had to find out what had really happened to the missing plane, and bring back proof of Jimmy's story. So, that afternoon, I crossed by the Tong Shan to the Portuguese territory of Macao, a useful listening post on the edge of the Bamboo Curtain. Mr Benton! I'm sorry to keep you waiting, Mr Benton. We've got a rush of tourists on our hands just now. Don't apologise for that. We need them! - Did you understand my wire? - Yes, sir, and I got busy right away. Don Benton. Okay. But, er... nobody here seems to know anything about the missing plane. The... the Portuguese authorities say that none of our nationals was travelling on board, so they're not interested. But it is very sad about the pilot. What about him? Well, I remember that he was a friend of yours. It is suggested that the plane was lost, with all its occupants, in the typhoon. Well, I have reason to believe that it wasn't. - You, um... tried the river people? - Yes, sir. The sampan men that we hire for our tourist trips. One of them seems to have heard some kind of rumour. He's on the wharf now. - Reliable? - Well, as a boatman, yes. When he chooses to turn up. I believe he does a little smuggling on the side. But he says he knows the pilot's mother. - Mao Tai Tai? - Mmm. - I'd like to talk to him. - Ah Wing! Ah Wing. - Mr Benton. - How do? Hello, Ah Wing. So you're a friend of M... Mao Tai Tai? Hai. Your licence, Ah Wing. Better make a show of hiring him. Do you know, er... many places around here? Hai. Macao, Canton, Pearl River... Chinan Fu. You've heard something about Chinan Fu? Three days ago, plenty fog. Fishermen hear sound like fly-ship, very low on water. Then noise finish. Make like fly-ship finish too. Thanks. Maybe you'll work for me sometime. Is... is that the information you wanted? - It checks. - Well, that's fine. Now you will have time to dine with me before you leave. Before what? Well, the... the Tong Shan sails at seven. Of course, if you prefer to get the night boat... Mr Pereira, are you trying to get rid of me? Oh, by no means, Mr Benton. Only... What's on your mind? Well, until I knew the nature of your enquiries, it didn't seem very important, but, er... Ivano Kang is here. Ivano Kang! He arrived in Canton yesterday, from Moscow. Now, a man in his position doesn't fly 5,000 miles for nothing, Mr Benton. No. No, he doesn't. And he was seen in Macao last night, at the gambling casino. Well, maybe he just wants a little action at the tables. Do you think he'll come again? Of course he will. It's only an hour or so by car. Now, Macao is, shall we say, neutral territory, but frankly, Mr Benton... You think it might be dangerous for me to stay here? Mr Benton, it is dangerous for anyone who shows so much interest in the happenings along the estuary. Now, you know me, Mr Benton. If there's anything I can do for you... Well, thanks, Pereira. You can take me home, and ask your charming wife to let me have a room. You... you're staying? I think I might like some action at the tables myself. (TRAFFIC PASSING) (CHATTERING) Mr Benton! Long time no see. Hi, Liang Ti! I've been too busy sending you rich tourists. So now you come yourself, with pockets full of dollars to lose at the tables. Well, there is one here named Jasmine Bud. A darling. - Hmm? - No? Merely to see old friends? Well, to see one old friend, Liang Ti. I never thought that words alone could make me so happy, Don. Even if I know they're not true. Have I ever lied to you, Liang Ti? Are you in trouble, Don? No, it's... it's for a friend of yours and mine. I'm, er... trying to find out what happened to a certain plane. - The one that disappeared? - Mmm. Well, what makes you think I know anything about it? You have many visitors from Canton. Well, there is one, but I don't think... Miss Liang Ti, somebody want change more money. Later. Amuse yourself, Don. Oh, excuse me. Who's in there? (SPEAKING RUSSIAN) Liang Ti say maybe you like something to drink. Brandy? Champagne? Oh, just bring me a cold bottle of beer. You play. I come back to you. Good girl. Stick around, and bring me luck. (INAUDIBLE) Thank you, honey. Hey! (GROANING) (SHOUTING IN RUSSIAN) - (FOOTSTEPS RECEDING) - (DOOR CLOSING) (KANG CHUCKLING) Well, well, well, my old friend, Mr Benton! And, like all Americans, in a hurry. Colonel Kang. I'm sorry to crash in like this, but the... somebody outside is just a little bit touchy. - Maybe it was me. - No, Mr Benton. Not you, I'm sure. But now that you're here, why don't you stay for a while, and forget those troublemakers? Thanks, but I don't want to muscle in on your little party. Good wine is something to be shared between friends. So are lovely women. Consuela... Peach Blossom... Tanya. Tanya... or Kuma San. If any of them stirs your fancy... Well, how can one choose from so much loveliness? Perhaps something a little stronger will help you to decide. I'm conservative, myself. I stick to the best mixture in the world. Champagne... - vodka... - And Sam Shui. (CHUCKLING) You remember, eh? I could hardly forget that! You persuaded me to try it one time. Um... no, no, this time I think I'll, um... I'll stick to beer. So you are here for a vacation? Unofficially, it's business, but, er... one wants a little relaxation sometimes. How I agree with you. I find it a great relief to escape to the bright lights of Macao. In these days, Moscow and Peking have a certain puritanical austerity. And rightly so, but in time it can become a little, er... stifling. How's the travel business? Thriving, I hope? Well, it'd thrive a lot more if I could book my visitors to China. But naturally. You should visit Canton and talk to the authorities about it. (CHUCKLING) Are you kidding? I've been trying for years, and I still haven't got a visa. Evidently, you don't approach the right people. I'll see what I can do. (INAUDIBLE) Kong-mi-ye? Well, Mr Benton, if you'll excuse me for a while, merely to repose for a little, in a more secluded spot. - (GIRLS GIGGLING) - This travelling. So tiring. Colonel Kang. I'll see you in Canton. Mmm. DON: Kang kept his word, and fast. Early next morning, a messenger was waiting at my Macao office with a visa to Canton. I took the next boat, and, very shortly, was registering at the hotel. CLERK: Welcome to New China, Mr Benton. Un sop yat. Number 51 is reserved for you, sir. Very nice room facing the front. Reserved? Hmm, somebody's been very kind. With the compliments of China Travel Service, sir, hoping you will enjoy a happy and instructive visit to Canton. I hope so, too. Anything else? Yes, sir. The director himself has telephoned about an interview. If convenient to you, he'll send a car at four o'clock. You like to see your room now? No, I think I'll take a little stroll for a while. Oh, er... am I supposed to take a guide? Oh, no, sir. You can go anywhere you like. No-one is ever lost in Canton. I see what you mean. Can you tell me where I can pick up a souvenir or two? What you like, sir? Very nice Canton silk? No, no, er... maybe some porcelain. Go to the streets of the potters, sir. Plenty shops there, all together. Thanks. (INAUDIBLE CONVERSATION) DON: The street of the potters wasn't hard to find, but what I was after was the shop of one Han Po. My friend Liang Ti, head girl at the Macao gambling casino, had given me his name as a man whom I could trust. (SPEAKING CHINESE) Oh. All the best periods: Ming, Kang Hai... Poor copies of the masters, as you see. If any of them interest the gentleman? Well, this one interests me very much. That one? Perhaps a little less imperfect than the others. Imperfect? This is the real thing. The secret of that glaze was lost five hundred years ago. (FOOTSTEPS) (SPEAKING CHINESE) You're right. It's, er... it's a very excellent copy. For a minute, I was taken in. I'm looking for something, um... a little unusual. Something unusual? Perhaps I can show you something in here? One of these, perhaps? An unworthy attempt in the style of Sung. That's fine work, Han Po. Anyone would be deceived. Not you. The Ming did not deceive you. Is it so dangerous, then, to own a piece like that? Not dangerous, but unwise. In these days, things of a certain value... You would not understand, Sin Shang. - A craftsman needs... - I know, I know. I love the old things, too. Why does a man of knowledge come to me, an imitator? I was sent here by a friend, a woman named Liang Ti. One of my clan. What does she know of pottery? Not much, but she knows men. She spoke of one that I might find here. What man? One whose heart is like the things he fashions. I need your help, Han Po. Sin Shang, this city lives on whispers, all of spies. Spies on the land, and in the sky. Three nights ago, some were captured and brought here. Is anything known about them? Only that three were foreigners. Do you know where they are now? Where? If the gentleman will return in two days' time, it will be glazed, ready to take away. Two days? Why not tomorrow? Tomorrow, every shop must close, until the massacre is ended. The...? Wh... what massacre? Tonight is the Night of the Sparrows. The Night of... For the present, all that I can do. But I think it is what the gentleman is looking for. Mr Benton. Talk plenty business with the director of the travel bureau? Ah, the director talked plenty, period. Maybe we'll get down to business tomorrow. Huh? What's all this? "Cultural Association", "Agricultural Cooperative", "Economic Study Group"... With the compliments of the information officer, sir. Makes good bedside reading. Thanks, er... Nothing like a little fun in bed. Mr Benton? Ma'am, you're in the wrong room. No, I'm not. I took great care to find the right one. Well, that's mighty kind of you, but, er... I've had a long day. I didn't think you were a fool. But, er... perhaps you're on their side? Whose side? Oh, you mean those guys you were doing the conga with in the hall today. I was trying to speak to you. So when that failed, you slipped a buck to the house-boy, and he gave you my name and room number. Is that right? Wrong. It cost me ten. Well, I'm flattered. But I hate to see good money wasted. Was it? Well, it, um... it depends on what you want. I could tell you, if you'd stop wandering round the room like that. Lady, I was going to bed. Don't worry. You'll be there quite soon. I promise. You could try and be polite. All right. - That better? - Much better. Don Benton, American. Mind if I call you Don? Ma'am, you can call me anything you like. Why did you come to Canton? To see the Chinese. Sorry to disappoint you, ma'am. I just thought if, um... you'd been someone official, you might have been able to help me. I'm, er... strictly a private citizen, but if there's anything a simple businessman can do, I... - I'd like to try. - On strictly business grounds, of course. Might even mix in a little pleasure, if I knew what the score was. You were on that plane, weren't you? Yeah. Wasn't a joy ride, either. When we crashed, I... I thought we'd drown. - But they came and took us off. - Us? Where are the others? I don't know. They keep us apart. They remember I'm a woman. - You don't say. - Oh, it didn't stop them searching me. Then began the questioning. Hours and hours of it. Perfect little gentlemen, but they never let up. It's been three days now. I don't know what they want from me. Well, maybe they don't know themselves. Are you under arrest? Not officially, but I can't leave the hotel. I've, um... heard of people being kept for months. Even years. Sometimes, they just disappear. There must be something you can do for me. Ma'am, I'm not a man to let down a lady in distress, but, er... there's six hundred million people out there, and I'm just one guy. Maybe when I get back to Hong Kong, I can get in touch with your consul, or... Or call up the Marines. Thanks a lot. Have you tried to contact any of the others? How could I? I haven't seen any of them since they took us ashore. Everyone? All except the pilot. He tried to escape. They fired machine guns at him in the water. Poor kid. He never had a chance. You saw that? You could testify to it? Well, sure, once we get out of here. Does the design of three fishes mean anything to you? Oh, you know about that? Yes, it's the name of the house they first took me to. Brainwashing de luxe. But, er... aren't we sort of getting off the... (KNOCKING) Which way d'you come? The balcony? Yes, Room 26. - I'll talk to you later. - Right. Oh, what's... what's your name? - Lola. - Lola. Lola Sanchez. (KNOCKING) Ah, Mr Benton. How delightful to see you in Canton. Won't you ask me to come in? Don't tell me you need an invitation. (DISTANT SINGING) (SINGING AND JANGLING) Come here, Mr Benton. This is something you must not miss. Well, what is it? The spirit of New China. Nothing will stand in its way. No man or creature, however small. - Not even sparrows? - Sparrows? Maybe you share the usual capitalist sentimentality about small animals? I've no strong feeling either way. You know that the sparrow eats nine catties of grain a year? That much? Enough to feed a family of six for weeks. You don't say. Tonight in Canton, there are a million sparrows. Tomorrow, there will be not one. Well, what are you going to do? Send them to the salt mines? A sparrow can only stay in the air for two hours without alighting. At a given signal, they will be forced into flight, and will be kept flying until they fall, exhausted. The rest is merely a problem of sanitation. "The massacre of the sparrows." The organised elimination of a greedy pest, Mr Benton. You'll see the fabulous discipline of a whole city. Every man, woman and child will be out on the streets with drums, gongs, rattles, firecrackers, anything that will make a noise. Well, maybe some of them like sparrows? The people of China have attained wisdom. Their sense of duty overrules individual preference. Too wise to stick their necks out, maybe. - On the subject of wisdom... - Hmm? Let me give you a little advice. Well, I'm always glad to listen, Colonel. Hotel rooms are no places for private conversation. There are so many ways in which they can be... overheard. No. Yes. You m... No, my friend. Not as obvious as that. "I am not a man to turn down a lady in distress." That's very flattering. You remember my words verbatim. I am disappointed in you, Mr Benton. I obtained you a permit so that you could carry out your lawful business, and not conspire with persons detained for investigation. That girl was frightened sick, and she asked me to help her. Which you know very well. What have you got against her, anyway? She entered the country illegally. The authorities must do their duty, and you will admit they are not doing it unkindly. Hmm. What about the other people on that plane? Your permit expires tomorrow night, Mr Benton. I advise you as a friend to conclude your business quickly, and go home. Thank you, Colonel. That's just what I plan to do. I'm glad to hear that, for your sake. I understand that the head of our travel service is going to see you tomorrow again at eleven. There will be a car to take you there, and then back to Macao. That's what I call real oriental hospitality. Well, if you don't mind, I'd like to make it an early night. Have a good night, Mr Benton. Room service, please. Can you send up a room boy? Thanks. If the gentleman in number 51 goes out tonight, report to me by telephone. I do not want him followed. Understand? Understand, sir. (DOOR OPENING) Jasmine tea, sir? Water keep hot all night. Do you serve Room 26? Yes, sir. Very nice European lady. Gave me present. Oh. Well, um... here's another one for you. Can you take her a message? No can do, sir. Lady gone away just now. Gone? Gone where? Very nice tea, sir. Made special for gentleman. Ah. "They've taken me away to the Street of the Willows. Lola." DON: Lola. Lola Sanchez. She had seen them gunning Jimmy in the water. That was the evidence I needed to clear his name. Wherever she was, I had to find her and, if possible, get her out. (DIALLING PHONE) "The Street of the Willows." It was a lucky break she'd had time to leave that note. Or was it? Kang had overheard enough of our conversation to guess why I'd come to Canton. And what was his real interest in detaining her? The three fishes! (CLANKING) LOLA: Hello. I thought you'd lost courage. Courage, hell! I've never been so scared in my life. What is this place, anyhow? Never mind. You're here. I had to arrange about a getaway. There's a boat waiting down at the waterfront. - Come on, let's go. - Not yet. Well, what is it? We must wait. - For a few moments. - Mmm. I, um... I wasn't sure before, but, er... I know now. You know what? The reason you came to Canton. You, the simple businessman, who likes to mix business with pleasure. - That's me. - Ah-ah. You are strictly business. - And not so simple, either. - Mm-hmm You came here to find out what happened to the missing plane, and the people on it. In particular, your courier. Didn't take you long to find me. You're the... I never thought our people could move so fast. You must be one of our top agents. Oh, well, I... I wouldn't exactly say that. Well, I can relieve your main anxiety at once. I've kept the message safe. - You have? - Mm-hmm. - Well, where is it? - Here. (CHUCKLING) That's the way I work. Never anything on paper. You've heard of photographic memories? - Sure, sure. - Well, it's not so very rare. All I have to do is look at a page. Even if I don't understand a word of it, I can reproduce every word and every dot. I see. - It's another one of your talents. - Another? Never mind. Erm... do... do they know about this? Yes. That's what's kept me safe. They want it badly, but they know it's no use threatening me. Not even with torture? In my case, they can't be sure it wouldn't defeat their own purpose. You see, if I die, the information dies with me. That's why they've been using gentler methods. That is, until now. Now you're scared their patience might be running out? Well, not scared, just... just weighing up the possibilities. It's a strange job for a girl, working against her own country. I've never had a country of my own. Well, you're neither Chinese nor American, so there could hardly be any patriotic motive. There are others. Anyway, why worry about motives? I wouldn't change my life. It has its compensations, you know. Excitement... danger... (CHUCKLING) You're a funny girl. Why? Because I like living dangerously? That's when you really have the taste of life. In danger, my eyes, my ears, all my senses become sharpened. Every feeling a hundred times intensified. That's when I really come alive. Then, to you, danger is a kind of a drug? Not to you? All I've got to do is look at you, and... The wise man never arrives too early. Or too late. I'm sorry I broke that rule. Don't apologise. - After all, you are the host. - The host? And a host has a duty to his guests. Unfortunately, our business is becoming a little urgent. But, thanks to you, my dear young lady, we now know all we need to know concerning Mr Benton's purpose in Canton. So one of our little problems has already been solved. Oh, I'm glad to hear that. Er... do you mind letting me in on the solution? You're still acting the part, my friend? We are holding you as a spy. A spy by invitation. You got me the permit, remember? But you asked for it, remember? Naturally, we're interested to learn how much, or how little, your superiors know about that plane. I hope you will be sensible enough to tell us. In which case, we may let you go. In time. Generous as always, Kang. My friend, you've played your cards. Why not admit that you've lost the game? I would hate to be forced into any unpleasantness. And I also hate to do business on an empty stomach. As the sage says, "where amity dwells, agreement finds an open door." As it happens, I must return to Moscow early in the morning. My plane leaves at seven, so, before that ungodly hour, we must reach agreement on all outstanding matters. Including our negotiations with you, my dear. And, if you'll forgive me, to remark that they've dragged on far too long already. It takes two to make a bargain, Mr Kang. "The greedy cormorant loses the best fish." By the way, if Mr Benton's presence embarrasses you, he can easily be removed. LOLA: No, I... I prefer him to be present. I'm sure he'd be very helpful. I bow to the lady's wishes. As you please. Well, I've made my offer, which is far above the original limit. You have exactly half an hour in which to accept. And if I don't? This is a very pleasant place. Much more pleasant than the corrective prison. Oh, I'm sure you wouldn't send me there, Mr Kang. You're a very charming woman, but you're expendable. Like any human being. Some aren't. Not if they have the right kind of insurance. Insurance? Mm-hmm. I call it my vocational risk policy. Very useful. Very few policies apply to earthquakes and tidal waves, and, I can assure you, our power is very similar. I'm sure there's a dentist in Detroit who'd be very interested to hear that. What did you say? Or the woman who runs a dress shop in Dallas. Or perhaps the used car salesman in Seattle. - Er... these people are...? - A list of Mr Kang's friends in America. It's a long list. I know it by heart. And the names to fit the occupations. I think you've said enough. You've made it now quite impossible for us to ever let you go. That would be very unfortunate. For you, Mr Kang. You see, the list is not only in my head. It is also neatly typed out, in a safe deposit at the Chase Bank in Washington. And if I'm not back in a week from tomorrow, they have instructions to call an unlisted number, and someone will collect it. Of course, you may be lying. Mm-hmm. But that's a risk you dare not take. Ah, don't look so glum, Mr Kang. After all, you're still in the bidding. Bidding? I wasn't aware there was to be an auction. Mmm, that's exactly what it is. And thanks to you, for bringing the principal bidders together. You want that formula badly. Mr Benton here, I'm sure, doesn't want me to sell it to you. After all, it took a long time to develop. It would be a pity if it, er... became useless, just because Mr Kang's friends wanted it too. This is most irregular. I like to do business on my own condition. Fair, of course, but still my own conditions. But the lady wants an auction. So, she ought to have an auction. In fairness, I must point out a little flaw in your assumption. What can any bid of yours be worth? To put it quite bluntly, you are at a great disadvantage, Mr Benton. You're not a free agent. That's easily arranged. I'm sure that Miss Sanchez will be willing to extend her vocational risk policy to cover me too. - You will, ma'am, won't you? - Certainly. If you're the buyer. I hope it'll encourage you to bid high. Of course, it, um... would make things easier if, er... Mr Kang's bid won. But it's really a matter of indifference to me. Indifference? Well... almost. I'd be sorry to leave you in an unpleasant situation. I... I rather like you. But one can't afford personal feelings in our profession. And you are a professional, my dear. - We can both appreciate that. Can't we? - Hmm. Sour! But dealing with a double agent can be very trying. They are so mercenary. But, what can one do? Suppose we add the little matter of twenty per cent to the original offer? I think I ought to know what the original offer is. Otherwise, how can I bid? Certainly. Mr Kang has just bid a hundred and fifty thousand dollars. I did not. It was a hundred and twenty. I think I can do a little bit better than that. Erm... a hundred and sixty. Cash. Did I hear a hundred and sixty? I repeat: one hundred and sixty. No more? Is that the final offer? Going... going... (LOUD BANG) (FIREWORKS AND FIRECRACKERS) (KANG LAUGHING) It is nothing. Just the sparrows. (HEAVY THUD) - Now's our chance. - Oh, no. The auction isn't over yet. (GUNSHOT) (GUN FALLING TO FLOOR) You're coming with me. You won't have a chance to sell that information now. You fool. You think you can drag me away? You'll be lucky to get away alone. You've no choice. Your fingerprints are on that gun. If they find you here with that... Come on, let's go. (CROWD SHOUTING) Come on. KANG: (GROANING) Get them. (GUNSHOTS) (CROWD JANGLING BELLS) (WHISTLES BLOWING) (FIRECRACKERS BANGING) (SPEAKING CHINESE) (MULTIPLE GUNSHOTS) This way. (BODYGUARD SHOUTING) (GUNSHOT) (GUNSHOT) Come on, we'd better go. Don... Don... danger... danger's when... one really comes alive. HAN PO: Mr Benton? Mr Benton, boat ready. We carry her? No matter. One man can go more quickly. Come, come. (SHIP'S HORN BLOWING) What kept you so long? Mr Benton, I came as soon as my girl gave me the message. - Did you get that boarding pass? - Yes, it's here. I'm sorry, I would have been here to meet you, only you arrived sooner than I expected. I left Canton in a bit of a hurry, on the sampan express. Did you find what you were looking for? - Yeah. - Good. And then some. Oh, then I... I think you'd better get straight in your cabin. Mr Pereira, what is there about me that seems to make you so nervous? Oh, it's nothing, it's nothing. It's just that the boat is ready to sail. Every time I arrive here in Macao, you seem to be pushing me aboard a steamer. Mr Benton, I have worked for you for two years now. Now, during that time, you have appeared here in Macao on numerous occasions. Now, none of these could be called, not even by the farthest stretch of the imagination, routine visits. Something always happens, and I am always the one left in the middle! Oh, which reminds me. There's a girl shot on the dock at Canton. - You see what I mean? - I'd appreciate it if you'd make - the necessary arrangements. - Yes, but, Mr... Passport? Oh, I doubt it. She kept everything in her head. What? She's what you might call a citizen of the world. Mr Benton, you know it's impossible to get into Canton... Mr Pereira, you're in the travel business. Inventiveness: that's the symbol of our firm. Yes, but Canton is not one of... I... Earn your money, Mr Pereira. Very good, sir. Be seeing you. I shall look forward to it. (CHATTERING) Prison not make Jimmy fat. Swee Lim, you look see he eat plenty big dinner. Anyone would think I'd spent weeks there. Four days. Too much. But it was for his own safety, ma'am, until Mr Benton found Miss Sanchez, and confirmed his version of the truth. Such a beautiful girl! You look for beautiful girls in Hong Kong. All the same your sister. You hear that, Tai Ko? Well, I hate to leave the family celebrations, but... duty hours, you know. Well, good luck, Jimmy, and don't get involved in any more incidents. Other people don't know you as we do. Inspector must have more. Number one dish coming up. Canton duck, Bill. Tai Tai's speciality. You've got to try it. Not me. Swee Kim make. She very good cook. Tai Ko, the best damn travel agent in Hong Kong. Yum seng. ALL: Yum seng, Tai Ko! I'll be back for lunch. If you need me, you can call me at Sir Charles' house. The train, Tai Ko! Good morning, Mr Benton. Is this your office, Mr Orme? No, no, just up one minute and down the next. Anyway, I'm glad to have this chance to thank you for your help in solving the Lola Sanchez case. I thought I was helping with the Jimmy Mao case. You might like to know that the list she left behind as her insurance policy has caused quite a stir in Washington. Hmm. That insurance had quite a premium. You know, I wish you'd reconsider my offer. We need an undercover man here. Uh-uh. It's a quiet life for me these days. Well, think it over. Anyway, I hope to see you again soon. (CHUCKLING) Oh, no, you won't! Well, anyway, not... not too soon. SUBTITLES BY POWERHOUSE FILMS LTD
