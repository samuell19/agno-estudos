Her hand moved behind his head and supported it. Her fingers moved gently in his hair. She looked up and across the barn, and her lips came together, and smiled mysteriously. You've been listening to The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck. If you... Our college trip took twenty-one hours and five minutes. Hey, why don't- wait. Let's just sit with what we heard. Are you serious? We- we don't have to be constantly entertaining ourselves, do we? I wish I could live through something. Aren't you? -Nope. The only exciting thing about 2002 is that it's a palindrome. Okay fine, well yours is the worst life of all, so you win. Oh, so now you're mad? Because I wanted to listen to music? -No, it's just you're being ridiculous because you have a great life. I'm sorry I'm not perfect! -No one's asking you to be perfect, just considerate will do. I don't even wanna go to school in this state anyway, I hate California. I wanna go to the east coast. -Your dad and I will barely be able to afford in-state tuition. There are loans, scholarships! -Your brother, your very smart brother? He can't even find a job. He and Shelly work. They have jobs! -They bag at the grocery store. That is not a career, and they went to Berkeley. Your father's company is laying off people right and left. Did you even know that? No, of course you don't, because you don't think about anybody but yourself. Immaculate Heart is already a luxury. -Immaculate FART. You wanted that, not me. Miguel saw someone knifed in front of him at Sac High, is that what you want? So you're telling me you want to see somebody knifed right in front of you? -He barely saw that. I wanna go where culture is, like New York or at least Connecticut or New Hampshire -How in the world did I raise such a snob? where writers live in the woods. -You couldn't even get into those schools anyway. Mom! -You can't even pass your driver's test. Because you would't let me practice enough! The way that you work, or- or the way that you don't work, you're not even worth state tuition, Christine. My name is Lady Bird. -Uh, well actually it's not, and it's ridiculous because your name is Christine. -Call me Lady Bird like you said you would. Just- you should just go to city college. You know with your work ethic just go to city college and then to jail, and then back to city college, and then maybe you'd learn to pull yourself up and not expect everybody to do everything- In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy spirit. Amen. Let the Lord be with you. -And also with you. Welcome all of you back to the start of a new school year, all the Xavier boys and Immaculate Heart girls. Hail Mary, full of grace.

Those aren't the rules, this is my house. A reading from the letter of Saint John. We're afraid that we will never escape our past. and we're afraid of what the future will bring. We’re afraid we won’t get into the college of our choice. We're afraid we won't be loved, we won't be liked, we won't succeed. There are the classics: St. Augustine, of course, Aquinas. My favorite, Kierkegaard. Oh, wait until you hear his love story. It will make you swoon. And the coming of our saviour, Jesus Christ.

I think it's a little upsetting. It’s my tradition to run for office. Don't worry, I won't win. That's not what I'm worried about. This won't mess up my scholarship, will it? No, you're okay there. You have a performative streak, I think. Yeah, I think that too. Maybe you would enjoy theatre arts. They're having auditions for the fall musical. Do we have that here? It's a collaborative effort with the men at Xavier. How am I a senior and not know we have that? Perhaps you haven't always been an active part of this community. They do a fall musical and a spring play, and from what I hear it's a real blast. What I'd really like is to be on Math Olympiad. But math isn't something that you're terribly strong in. That we know of, yet. Here you go. -Thanks. “Julie” doesn't need to be in quotes. But it's not my real name. It's not the same thing. I'm not sure you're right. God, I love this neighborhood. Yeah, it's so beautiful. If I lived here I would definitely have my wedding in the backyard. I'd have friends over all the time to study and eat snacks. I'd be like “Mom, we're taking the snacks upstairs to the TV room.” I'd have my own bathroom. I can't stop you dicks from hanging out here but quit wrinkling all the magazines! When I'm in this store, I'm not your sister. I'm a customer, Miguel! I'm always right! Ever since she moved in, your brother and Shelly are becoming the same person. -No way. Yeah, okay, maybe. See, why I don't look like that? -Yeah. Just once I'd like to have the song “New York Groove” play and feel like it really applies to my life. You've never even been to New York. That's why I'm applying to New York colleges. Do you know if Sarah Lawrence is actually in the city? Your parents would pay for that? -Scholarships, financial aid. I'll figure it out. My mom thinks I can't get in but she is sorely mistaken. What about terrorism? -Don't be a Republican. Probably just gonna go to city college. Put the magazine back! Shit! You doing okay, mama? -Hi, oh, yeah, that was terrifying, wasn't it? Thank god you were there. I guess I can't have pencils anymore. Yeah, gotta go back to just felt tip markers. Crayola. -Right. Thank you. Luis, it's for you! Got it for the baby, I couldn't resist. She loves pink! -It's more for you and Andrea than it is for the baby. And I'm sorry I didn't have time to wrap it. -No, it's perfect. I'll see you tomorrow... or I mean, later. Thank you! -Okay. Did you know toothpaste is basically ineffective? It's like sucking on a mint. Mike Kerry died. I didn't even know he was sick again. How old was he? Only fifty-six. Can Shelly and I get in there? In a minute honey. Dad and I are still in here. That’s too young. Lady Bird you better be dressed. I am dressed! I'm gonna send them a note. Do you think that Shelly and Miguel have sex on the pull-out couch? Oh, yeah. Why can't I just make the eggs? Because you take too long, you make a big mess and I have to clean the whole thing up. Eggs aren't good for the environment, anyways. -What? You heard her. -Eat quickly, please. Look at all these pictures. Every newspaper looks like USA Today. Shelly and I are trying to be vegan. Hence the soy milk. You wear leather jackets. -But they're vintage, so they don't support the industry. They aren't done, there's white stuff. -You know how you love Brambles? Pigs are smarter than him even. I never thought Brambles was a genius, okay? Mom, the eggs are not done. -Fine, make your own fucking eggs. I wanted to, you won't let me! Your sister doesn't like me. -I'm hungry! She does! Baby... -You had your chance! Going to bed. Did you know that Alanis Morisette wrote this song in only ten minutes? I believe it. So, I'm applying to a couple of east coast schools. I need you to help me with the financial aid application but Mom can't know. We... aren't they quite expensive? First, yes. That's why financial aid. Second, I have to get in first. Mom won't be happy about it. Which is why I don't want to fight about it before I have to. Just pull over here. -Are you sure? I- I can drive you to the front. -No, this is fine. I like to walk. Well... love you. So, what do you think about college? See what I can do. -Thanks dad. I love you too. Have a good day at work. Hey, I'm like Keith Richards, “I'm just happy to be anywhere”. Hey bitch! -Hey! Alright girls, hope you like pickles. Thanks, Uncle Matt. -Sweet! He's not your uncle. -Just something I'm trying out. Bye, mom. -Bye. -Bye, love you! Your Mom really likes you. -Yeah. I just keep getting fatter. -Me too. Matt's awesome. Yeah, I hope he marries my mom. That would be so nice. He promised me his old car when I turn eighteen. That car should be illegal. Jenna Walton’s not doing any off-roading. She just goes to Pavillions. I heard Jenna Walton has a tanning bed in her house. She is so pretty. Her skin is luminous. Maybe we should try tanning. -Yeah. In the tub I just- I scoot myself under, just like now, like this, and then the water just... We are so gross. I think I figured it out when I was like three or something. I use, I take the shower head... Oh my god. -This is embarrassing! I use that. I don't know if mine is the right kind though. Maybe it's different when you actually have a penis in there, like it's more intense. Mine is pretty intense, I think. You're not supposed to eat the wafers!

You're going to make a great Franklin. Oh, thanks. I want my hair, orhis hair to be curly, though. Yeah! -Like um, like Jim Morrison. Very ’70s. Like Jim Morrison, exactly. -Yeah.

Oh, that's her. Gotta go, bye guys. -Bye! Oh, I almost forgot, I brought you these hot rollers. For your Jim Morrison hair. -Thank you so much. You're welcome. Y- you'll have to show me how to use them. It would be my pleasure. They look like sperms. I- I just remembered I had a dream about you. Really? -Yeah. W- What happened? -Um...

I could tell from your work that you even understood he one you missed! Suck a dick. I like "Jules". I just don't get why I'm not good at math, my Dad is really good at math. Even Miguel has a math degree. -Maybe it's your Mom's fault. You lose! Point Julie. -No, look. Wish me luck. -Luck. Hey, wanna dance? -Hell yeah. Six inches for the Holy Spirit. That's us. Oh, uh no, my mom's coming. -No she's not. Yes, she is. -No, the plan was to sleep over at my house. No, it's fine. Okay, bye. -Bye. Hey Matt! Have you ever been out of the country? When I was little. -Hm. M- my dad had a job that took him to Brazil. I remember from the pictures. My dream to- oh, sorry. -No, no, you go. I've never been out of the country. It's uh, it's my dream to go to Paris. Paris... It's why I'm taking French. My mom said French wasn't useful. It is if you wanna go to Paris. Still don't know how to use those rollers that you gave me. -Oh. Oh, it's so easy. So, it's- after they heat up you... you take your hair and you twist the hair like this, and... (LADY BIRD SCREAMS) Larry how long will this hold us? I don't know. -Well somebody's... gotta know. Can the whole family go on Cobra, even Miguel? I'm not sure. -What happens if somebody gets in an accident? Uh the severance package I think it expires all at once, not within the calendar year... Is she home? Maybe just leave it tonight. No she knows better. She can't sneak around like this. -Marion... Christine. You can't leave your room like this. I didn't. -None of these things were put away right. They aren't nice. Christine, now. -I- I put my clothes away. My name is Lady Bird. -Don't lie to me. This- this uniform? This is gonna look like trash on Monday. This isn't right. We can't treat our clothes like this. I don't know what your wealthy friends do. -Why do you care what I do to my clothes? Your father doesn't have a job. He lost his job. Do you need him to come in here to explain that to you? Of course he wouldn't do it anyway, he's Mr. Nice Guy and I always have to be the bad guy. Can we please just talk about this tomorrow? -You can't look like a rag... because that makes us look like rags. And you want to know the truth? Here's the truth: Some of your friends fathers could employ your father and they're not gonna do it if his family looks like trash. You understand? Didn't you ever go to sleep without putting all your clothes away perfectly? Like even once? And don't you wish your Mom hadn't gotten angry? My mother was an abusive alcoholic. So I understand you're not interested in any Catholic colleges? No way. Sorry, but yes, no way. Then you'll be applying to UCs and State schools. Yeah, but also those east coast liberal arts schools like Yale, but... not Yale because I probably couldn't get in. You definitely couldn't get in. Part of my job is to help you be realistic. Yeah, that seems like everyone's job. Your SAT scores are strangely very good.

Did Danny say whether his grandmother has a formal thanksgiving? I don't know, there are a lot of kids, but she lives in the fab forties. Oh well, your dad and I went to a dinner party once in that neighborhood, The CEO of ISC, that was pretty formal. You're not going to a funeral. Well I don't know, what says "rich people thanksgiving"? I just think it's just such a shame that you're spending your last Thanksgiving with family you've never met... instead of us, but I don't know, I guess you want it that way. Are you tired? -No. Hey Marion! Hey Joyce! How's the baby? He's crawling. Oh, I want to see a picture at checkout. -Okay! Okay. So if you're tired we can sit down. I'm not tired. -Oh, okay, I just couldn't tell because you were dragging your feet. Well, I just couldn't tell. Why didn't you just say “pick up your feet". -I didn't know if you were tired. You're being passive aggressive! -No, I wasn't. You are so infuriating. Please stop yelling. -I'm not yelling. Oh, it's perfect. -Honey, do you love it?

But there are actual train tracks. Oh, hi. You look amazing! What in the hell is in the duffel bag? Don't worry about it, jeez. My grandmother will love that dress. Okay. Wait.

It’s my parents’ number. You don't have a cell phone? Nah. -Good girl. Government didn't have to put tracking devices on us. We bought them and put 'em on ourselves. I don't own a tracking device.

No well- no she's warm but she's also kinda scary. Well you can't be scary and warm. I think you can, your mom is. You're gay! Fuck me. Can you not tell anyone please? I'm so sorry about everything. I'm so ashamed of all of it. It's just, it's going to be bad and I need a little bit of time before I figure out how to tell my mom and dad and... -Don't worry. I won't tell. It's okay. And do you have a support system? What do you mean? Who do you turn to when you feel this way? No one I guess. I'm sorry. No, don't be sorry. There's no wrong answer. Please don't tell your daughter. -No, of course not. Of course not. Remember that you are dust and to dust you will return. It's a new system you just enter your social security number and... Davis? -Davis is good. Maybe you should have looked at it. It's only half an hour away. Less if you're driving fast. I went to graduate school there. -Lots of smart people go to Davis. I thought Berkeley had to accept me. You and Miguel went there. I'm a legacy. Uh, not if we don't give money. And you get bad grades. Oh what do you know about it? -Meaning? Nothing. No, what are you implying? -Nothing! You fucking racist. -I didn't say anything. I didn't put down my race. -Oh, yeah, I'm sure they had no idea, MIGUEL. You're actually fucking evil. What is wrong with you? -Go. Go to your room. I'm not five. -I didn't raise you like this. I don't have to go anywhere. I'm not going to a fucking university that's famous for its fucking agricultural school. And Miguel and Shelly, you'll never get jobs with all that shit on your face. ♪ Cry me a river ♪ Hey. -Hi.

Okay, well let me get to the mirror, I gotta get going. When do you think is a normal time to have sex? You're having sex? -No. Um, college is good I think college and... use protection like we talked about. -Okay. Is dad depressed? Why do you ask that? The pills, they have dad's name on them. Dad's been struggling with depression for years. I didn't know that. Money is not life’s report card. He’s depressed about money? Being successful doesn't mean anything in and of itself it just means you're successful. Yeah, but then you're successful. But it doesn't mean you're happy. But he's not happy. I have to get out of Sacramento. Why? Because it's soul-killing. It's the mid-west of California. Isn't there a thing like: “think globally, act locally” I feel that the person who said that didn't live in Sacramento. I love it here. I want to send my daughters to Immaculate Heart.

And at fifteen, this girl was pregnant. She decided that she was going to get an abortion. It made sense. It was the right thing to do. She was sitting there waiting for the doctor to come in... -Let me guess, she didn't get it. and something deep inside of her said "no". -Bingo. Anyone wanna guess who this young lady was? The young lady right here. -You? No, it was not me. -Um... your friend? -No. The girl in the story was... my mother. I am that baby that she decided not to abort. That could've been me. That could've been my fate. Just because something looks ugly doesn't mean it's morally wrong. -What did you say, ma’am? Nothing. -Please share. I said... Just because something looks ugly doesn't mean that it's morally wrong. You think dead children aren't morally wrong? No. I'm just saying that... if you took up close pictures of my vagina while I was on my period it would be disturbing but it doesn't make it wrong. Excuse me? Listen, if your mother had had the abortion we wouldn't have to sit through this stupid assembly. Suspended? How does this happen? Everything we do is for you. Everything. Do you think I like driving that car around. Do you? -No. You think I like working double shifts at the psych hospital? -No. You needed to go to the Catholic school because your brother saw someone knifed in front of him at the public school, is that what you want? Larry what are you doing on the computer? -Nothing. You think Dad and I don't know how ashamed that you are of us? Your dad knows. Your dad knows why you ask us to drop you a block away from school every day. Dad I didn't mean to. -You made him feel horrible! Horrible. I'm sorry. You know that? -Marion you didn't have to bring that up. No, Larry, you can't just be the nice guy. She has to know! She has to know how you feel otherwise she's just gonna think she can say anything at all and nobody ever gets hurt. ”Wrong side of the tracks”. I didn't mean it that way, it was a joke. -Yeah, yeah, it's just a joke: "mom and dad, they don't care". We didn't think we'd be in this house for twenty-five years, we thought we'd move somewhere better. Whatever we give you it's never enough. -It is enough! Do you have any idea how what it cost to raise you? And how much you're just throwing away every day? Give me a number. What? Give me a number. I don't understand. You give me a number for how much it cost to raise me and I'm gonna get older and make a lot of money and write you a check for what I owe you so that I never have to speak to you again. Well I highly doubt that you will get a job good enough to do that. ...of the attack on Baghdad last night, it was absolutely unbelievable. -That's right, yeah, the likes of which uh, many US milit- Hello? -Hey, it's me, Jenna. Hey! Are you calling me from school? No, we got out early because all the Irish girls got totally sloshed by noon. Oh right, happy St. Patrick's Day. Yeah, I guess they'd been stock-piling mini liquor bottles in the tampon machines, and now they're all throwing up. Everyone else got out early. So, guess where I am? I don’t know, where? Ding dong, I'm outside. What? -I'm standing outside. No, I- just leave. Leave. Fuck. Hello. -Hi. So this is your house? Yeah. That lady in the other house was totally freaked out. That's my friend's grandma. That's her house. Why did you say it was your house. I wished I lived in that house. I don't even sort of understand why somebody would lie about that. I- I didn't lie. You lied. You're a liar. I hate dishonesty. I'm sorry. Apology accepted I guess. Are we still friends? I mean, if you're still Kyle's girlfriend then yeah, I guess I'll see you around. Mortar rounds fired at the camp that would fly over them if they are down below the surface of the grounds, and that is hard work, believe me, if we had to do it our- I'm ready. What? I'm ready to have sex. Oh, okay. Great. You're so dexterous with that. Thanks. Oh. You okay? -Yeah. Are you- Are you done? -Yeah, yes. Sorry, I was confused. You have like... -What? You have some sort of like- blood. -What? Oh, shit! I get nosebleeds. Here. -Thanks. I'm sorry. No, I'm good. Remember when tie-dye was an activity? Oh, I didn't make that shirt, my parents got it for me at Sea Ranch. You can read “Sea Ranch” if you look close. Cut to "ten years later". What? Like how 10 years ago you were in first grade, and now we cut to. What does "cut to" mean to you. Or like "little did he know..." Nothing you're saying makes sense. -How we're not virgins now. We deflowered each other. We have each other's flowers. Sorry. I'm just happy. I didn't lose my virginity to you. Wait... What? I lost my virginity to Cassie Duval. Excuse me? You said you were a virgin. -No I didn't. 'Cause I'm not. And I haven't lied in two years. -Oh Jesus. Yeah, I've probably slept with like, six people? You don't even know if it's six people? I don’t keep a list. Why wouldn't you keep a list? We're in high school. Woah, why- what's- why are you getting so moody? You did say you were a virgin. I think you might have made an assumption. I just had a whole experience that was wrong. Look, you're deciding to be upset. -No, I am upset. Because you're deciding to be. Don't be mad at me for this. That's stupid. You can't be mad at me for something I have no control over. I just wanted it to be special. Why? You're going to have so much un-special sex in your life. I was on top! Who the fuck is on top their first time? Do you have any like, awareness about how many civilians we've killed since invasion in Iraq started? Shut up! Shut up. Different things can be sad. It's not all war. Are we still going to prom together? Sure. I thought Miguel was gonna pick me up. Well, I was just arriving from work, and it was easier. You okay? Oh, honey. Oh, oh it's okay! It's okay. What's this sweater? My friend Jenna gave it to me. -Who's Jenna? My friend. You wanna do our favourite Sunday activity? I don't have a second shift. Yeah. Lady Bird, a bunch of things arrived for you. Holy shit! Since when do you get mail? -I get mail. Whatever you're up to, it's not gonna end well. Yes! AAAH! The programmers nowadays are like, kids, man. -I know. But that's why with me you'll find something different. Yeah, but they're like babies. I hear you, it's wild. Which is why... I went back to school and got my MBA at UC Davis while still working at ISC. -Oh. Wow that must've been a lot of work. -It was. I heard ISC is closing now, though. I heard, yes. So the assholes who fired you are now closing up shop. Feels good. -Haha, yeah. What else is supposed to happen? Oh, I thought we'd... talk about the position. How'd it go? Let's go buy a big bag of Doritos and eat them in the car... to celebrate your waitlist. -Okay. Don't tell mom about the Doritos or the waitlist! Hey. -Hi son. Wait, what are you doing here? Well um... I guess we're uh, going for the same job then. Looks like it. Go get em. -Thanks. This- this way? -Yeah, yeah. I know it was you who did the just married thing. -It wasn't me. I'm not going to punish you. -Oh. Why not? It was funny. Sister Gina and I drove all the way home before we noticed people were honking. -Really? To be fair, I wasn't just married to Jesus. It's been fourty years. Well he's a lucky guy. I read your college essay. You clearly love Sacramento. I do? You write about Sacramento so affectionately and with such care. Well, I was just describing it. Well, it comes across as love. Sure, I guess I pay attention. Don't you think maybe they are the same thing? Love and attention? I guess you won't be going to any dances in college. This is our last one. You know Davis has a terrific theatre. If you're still interested in theatre. Are you? I’m probably no good at acting. Why don't I look like the girls in magazines? It's too bad I can't meet this Kyle before prom. He’s not my boyfriend anymore. I mean, maybe he never even was. -I'd still like to meet him. It's too tight. Fuck! Well I suggested you didn't have that second helping of pasta. -Mom! Honey, you seem upset about it, and I'm trying to help. -You're giving me an eating disorder. I wish I could get an eating disorder. I love it. Is it too pink? What? Why can't you say I look nice? I thought you didn't even care what I think. -I still want you to think I look good. Okay, I'm sorry, I was telling you the truth. You want me to lie? No, I mean. I just wish... I just- I wish that you liked me. Of course I love you. But do you like me? I want you to be the very best version of yourself that you can be. What if this is the best version? You look really pretty. Really? -Yeah, you look like a badass girl in a band. Thanks. Um, I guess that's my date. You aren't gonna get in a car with a guy who honks, are ya? I think, yes, I am. Let me get your picture. Mom's pissed she had to work a double. Even you deserve better than this. Have a good time! -Yeah, good luck! See ya. -See ya. I think she's weird. -She is weird. Hey guys, I guess I'll just sit shotgun. You look really nice, Kyle. -You look good. Thanks. Hi. Hi. -Hey. Hey, what's going on, man? Hey, yeah, okay, that sounds great. Okay.
