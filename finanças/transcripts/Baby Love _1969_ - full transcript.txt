Run! Mum. I'm home. No, I won't, so he's my friend. Oh, hello, love. I've just got a few letters I want to do. They still haven't done anything to the study. Yes, I know. Give me that, I'll give you a glass. Yes, thanks. Harry's up to his usual tricks. Oh, yeah. Okay? - Yes, that's fine. I'm with you in five minutes. Ah, there you are. Why did she pick on you after all these years? Well, we did grow up together. Darling, it all happened a long time ago. It doesn't matter now. Did you know she had cancer? Yes, yes I did. She talks about your letters. Yes? What letters? Amy, I also sent her money. Why? You wouldn't understand. The poor bitch, she had nothing. Nobody to turn to, only me. What about this daughter, luci. That's her. Is she yours? Now, come on, don't be stupid. She's a lovely child. Oh no. Come on. Luci. I'm Dr. quayle. Yes, I know. They told me at the welfare office you'll be here. I wanted to meet you. Hello. Thank you. You're older than I thought. What did you expect? Don't know, really. Someone about 20, you know, like you are in mum's photos. That was a long time ago. Mum was always talking about you. - Luci... - Did you love her very much? Yes I did. But you left her all on her own. Is it time, then? Luci, you don't have to go to this thing. I've got to. Ah, Mrs. Carmichael, this is luci. - Hello, dear. Can I take your case? Come on. Mrs. quayle, this is luci. Hello, luci. This is Nicky. - Hello. Right, well... What about a cup of tea? Yes, you two men go ahead it's ready in the kitchen. I'll take luci upstairs. This way, luci. Our bedroom's on the first floor. Yours and Nicky's is on the second. I'm afraid you'll have to share a bathroom with him. I hope you don't mind. Any phone calls for me? Nick? - Hmm? Oh, one or two, Mrs. Carmichael took them. Tea. I'll leave you to make yourself comfortable. The bathroom's two doors along if you want to have a wash, and come down and have tea with us. Do you like it? Here you are. Tell me, luci, are you as crazy about pop music as Nicky? I don't know. Yes. Ah, luci, you let me down. - Thank you, Mrs. Carmichael. - Thank you, Mrs. Carmichael. Oh yeah, she's what we call in this part of the world, Mrs. quayle's treasure. Well, what do you do then? I suppose I run the household. Nicky, sit up straight, darling. Nick. Nick! Beautiful girl, isn't she? Oh yes, very. - Is she like her mother? - No, nothing like that. What was she like? Well, you know. No, I don't know. Why won't you talk about her? Because it's 12:32. Goodnight, darling. You're not sorry she's here, are you? Hmm. You know, in a way I'm rather glad she is. Robert? Robert? - Hm? Have you thought about her schooling? Oh, plenty of time for that. Holidays have just started. Besides, we've agreed to take her only for a trial period. Oh, we might. - Morning. - Hello, pet. Good evening. Oh! - Good evening. - It's not that late. She's not down yet. I'm off. Oh, give her some pocket money, will you now? - Yes. - Not you. Bye-bye. - Bye-bye. Luci? Luci, are you awake, dear? Luci? Luci? Luci, open the door. Luci? Come on, young lady, get dressed. Breakfast is getting cold. There we are. I don't want to go down! I want to stay up here! It's a beautiful morning. Oh, dear. Come on, let's find you something to wear. We must get you some new things. They were new at Christmas. They're very pretty. What have you got there? Nothing. Well, show me. Luci, please? Shh. Come on. Darling, listen. If ever you feel unhappy, don't you lock yourself in again like this. You just come to me and we'll talk about it. You'll see it'll make it all much better. You know I act daft sometimes. Don't be cross with me. - Of course not. - Please don't send me back. Come on. Come on. You dry those eyes. Come on. Dry your eyes and come down and have some breakfast. Yes? Come on! Luci. Luci. Luci, darling. It's all right. Luci. It's all right. Sit her up. Right up. Now luci, drink this. That's it. All of it. And that bit there. That's fine. Don't leave me please. No. No, of course not. Don't be silly. Come on, darling. Good girl. Tomorrow I've got a nice surprise for you. - No, I don't like this. - You look very nice. - No I don't. - Do hurry. No, oh, I like this. No, no, I like this. Come on then, let's try. Stand there, boy. David. David, come here. Think they're all mine. Yeah, I like this one. Look, isn't it gorgeous? - Luci. What are you doing? Luci. Where you going? Come back here. - Luci! Luci, darling! Luci. Go in! Yes, it's lovely. Come on, in. Quickly. Yes yes yes yes yes. Quickly. Wait. Look. - Oh, my god. Yes, that's mine as well. Luci please go and put some clothes on. Can I have it? Yes, it's lovely darling. - Can I have it? - Yes, of course you can. Thank you. Ah. Well? Couldn't be much shorter, could it? It's all right, I suppose. Oh, now, Nicky. Now look, the two of you have a snack, then you take luci out the afternoon, and don't be late. This little piggy went to London Smithfield market, where together with a lot of his mates, he helps to keep the British larder full. You'll never guess where these fellows come from. You guessed it. Master butchers like this one are quick to spot the right bird, and their experience and know-how is the key to the young housewife's satisfaction. Meat auctions attracts the crowds. Some keen, some just curious. Here the butcher can see just what he is getting. This is a free for all, and anybody is welcome. Today the standard is very, very high, but a little rough meat still finds its way onto the British market. Judging meat on the hoof is an expert business, and it would seem there are fewer master butchers buying from the markets these days. Some say they are getting older, and that there are the youngsters going into the trade. Even so, these are the men who enjoy the excitement of the market auctions. Yet, the master butcher remains what he has always been, a craftsman, descendant of a long line. We're all Jack spratts of heart, you know. We like it lean. The modern taste is for small joints. This helps the farmer who can grow the end product more quickly, and that means more and more meat goes into the British oven. And here is the result of all the farmer's work and the butcher's craft. A prime cut of the protein. You don't have to ask whether they like it. Nick, stop acting. Nick... - You're filthy. You're such a stupid little boy. Why did you let him touch you? - Don't try hurting me! - Why did you? Next time I'll kill you. Nick? Nick! Nick! Have you ever given a French kiss before? Get out! - Luci, please! - Don't touch me. - You didn't mind earlier. - Get out! You didn't mind behaving like that in the cinema. Don't say that again! I'm sorry, I didn't mean it! - Get out! - Luci, please. Get out or I'll call your dad. - Luci! - Robert! Robert! What is it? Luci? Yes. I just wanted to thank you for the lovely new things I got today. Would you like me to show them to you? Luci, do you know what time it is? I'm glad you like them, anyway. Robert? Could I just ask you something? What? Mum used to read to me sometimes. Would you? You should be asleep. No, it's in the tin. The what? Under the bed. Do you think she'd be dead now, if you'd never have left her? Luci, I loved your mother very much. And because of that, I want to do the best I can for you. Now, where's the book? If you had have loved her, you'd have married her. And all this wouldn't have happened. You might have been me dad. You never even came to see her when she was sick. Luci it's very late. I'm tired. Is it true I'm like mum? Go to sleep. Is she all right? She worries me. What you talking about? I've decided I'm gonna have a talk with her on Wednesday. Why Wednesday? Because I'm back down to Brighton on Wednesday to see Charles's new annex and she asked if she could come with me. She wants to see to sea. Wednesday? Wednesday. She can't. She's asked me to take her to a fashion show. Has she? Do you know, it wouldn't surprise me if she hasn't done it on purpose. Oh, don't be stupid, she made a simple mistake, that's all. She forgot. Amy, don't get too attached to that girl. What a priceless remark. You know, if I didn't know you so well I'd say you were jealous. Jealous? Well, she made a simple mistake, you can't accept a simple logical explanation. Oh no. Clinical mind gets to work. What are you getting excited about? Just don't start using her for your own ulterior motives. Do you know what you're talking about? Yes, Robert, I do. Try to divide us, as your peculiar way of punishing me. Just because you feel inferior. Oh, whenever I get attached to something you try and break it up. When do you attached? You use people. You use me, you use my family. Yes, I know. And you use luci's mother. Now, just be careful. Just after you leave her, she has an abortion. Well, who left her in that condition, the milkman? Don't try and be cheap, Amy. You're very embarrassing. We were discussing luci. What else has the wicked child done? Just remember that I knew her mother! Morning. Darling, you don't have to do that. Oh, let me do it, please. Mrs. Carmichael said I could, I always did it at home. - Are you sure you can manage? - Mm. How marvellous to have a girl about the house. Did Mrs. Carmichael lay the table? No, I did. Today is your day at the clinic, isn't it? Friday is always my day at the clinic. Thank you for reminding me. - Wasn't it all right? - What? The breakfast. I'm not very hungry this morning. Bye. If he wants to be difficult, let him. Don't you run after him. I cause trouble between you two, don't 1? Oh, don't be silly. But I heard you last night. Luci, grown ups have quarrels all the time, doesn't mean anything really, it was all a stupid mistake. There we are. And who are you telephoning? Cassie's place. When did you last wash behind your ears? Yesterday, honest. Cross me heart and hope to die. You're a baby. Will you ever grow up? Never. I don't ever want to be old and plain. Like me? You're not old and plain. Can I use some of your eye makeup? With a complexion like yours, why do you want to spoil it? Let's see you. I'm going to paint my face. And paint, and paint and be utterly evil. What you wearing tonight? Aha. That's a surprise. You can't be serious. But they're all the rage. Really? Not here. Don't you like it? Get dressed. J where's the one she gave her heart to j j yesterday stays away too long j j he's the one who's there beside her j j he's the one she really loved & j where's the one she gave her heart to j j yesterday stays far too long j j there's the one who's been denying her & j he's the one she's thinking of I j baby love j j it's baby love j J baby love j j baby love j j baby love j do you want a drink?

You bloody well change your mind. You'll be such a stupid little boy. Why don't you grow up. You like old men, like my father. You wouldn't let him do anything, would you? Maybe. This is little girls' time. I think you better go, don't you? And shut the door. Amy, Amy! Amy! Amy! Amy! Are you all right darling? It's all right. Please don't leave me. Please. No, I won't. It's all right, darling. Shh. You know what I think? Hm? I think she's deliberately staging a return to childhood. Bedtime reading. It's perfectly natural. At her age? I thought I might sleep in her room for a few nights that's exactly what she's after, and it's exactly what you mustn't do. Oh really? Even if she does just want attention, what's wrong with that? Everything. What do you think of Cassius Clay? He's a good boxer. I think he's terrific. Do you think you find me attractive? You won't let me because I'm ugly. You think I'm ugly, don't you? Nicky... Mum, mum... I'm sorry, I overslept. I hope you didn't wait for breakfast. I had mine with Nick. What are you gonna do about the pearsons? The pearsons? Well, they're your friends. You can't keep on putting them off. Next Sunday. Right? Yes, fine. Nick! Excuse me, Dr. quayle. Oh sorry. Did you burn yourself? No, I'm all right, don't! You'll only make it worse. Go on, go outside. Breakfast outside. Hello. Hello. Feeling better? Better than what? Than you did this morning. I was perfectly well this morning. Oh, if you say so. When are you going to get the painters out of the study? Tessa? Yes. No. Course not. Hm, we're looking forward to it. How is margo? Oh. Well, it's quite natural. Mm, yeah. Listen, Tessa. No, it's all right, I'll talk to you on Sunday. Oh, yes, she's fine. Yes, settling in very nicely. Okay. Yes, I will. Bye, Tessa. Oh, get out. Bitch. So this is where you hide. Work. What are you doing now? I'm trying to write an article. No, please. You're pretty clever, aren't you. You must do pretty well. I do. Sometimes. Better than you would have done as a doctor up our way. Agreed. Why did you leave her? Luci I'm not... You never answered me when I asked you why you left her. Why didn't you stay with her? She always said she was happiest with you. Luci. Listen. You've got to try to understand that people's lives can change. Are you listening to me? Now, I changed mine. After university, things could never be the same again for me. Now your mother... She didn't want you to go! Just let me finish. Let me finish. I didn't want to leave her. But I was ambitious. Luci, come here. Come here, come here, come here. Luci, now you're here with us. Same eyes, same face. Luci I'm going to look after you. And again. Faster. - Two. - Two. - Four. - Four. - One. - One, that's mine. - Two. - Two. That's mine. Two. That's mine. That's mine. You laid the queen. Come on, get that sorted. Faster. - Two. - Two. That's mine. Come on, have another one. You're not quick enough, Nick. Go on. Faster. Two. They're mine. Two, put another one. That's mine, wait. Try again. Four. Two. Amy! That's yours. Thank you. Are you going up for the night? Yes, I think I'd better. Just to reassure her while she's having these nightmares. Come on, Nick. Three. Amy? Please sleep with me, Amy. I'm so lonely. Please. Pretty little thing, isn't she? I bet young luci's got a lot of admirers. Yes, she has. I don't mean me. Don't you? No. 24. 25. 20, ah... Oh, cut it out, luci. - How's the water? - Very nice, thank you. Mind you don't catch a cold. If I do, will you look after me, sir? Bah. D'you know, one of the advantages of approaching middle age is to have the things you really appreciate. Like this champagne, for instance. By the time we get them it's usually too late to enjoy them. Oh, I don't know. Do you? Daddy and Robert getting stoned. What are you doing about schooling? We had a party the last night of term. Veronica wedaborne drank half a bottle of gin. We pay 700 a year to send her to a school like that. She threw up all night. We thought she was going to die. That's enough, luci. Oh, leave her alone. I said that's enough, luci. Cheers. Did you notice how our little teaser behaved? Shall I drive? Why? Come on, wipe that pious look off your face. Is that all you learn to your convent for poor little rich girls? I was forgetting. They ought to have taught you how to spread your legs for me on the riverside at Oxford. The girl needs a psychiatrist. She's not the only one. You were disgusting tonight, you and Harry. You should have seen yourselves. She was disgusting with me. Just out of curiosity, was it luci or the mother you wanted? Come on, come on, don't be stupid. No. No! No! No! Ah! No, wait a minute. This way? That's very good. That way? Suits you. Come in number five. Come in number five. Your time's up. I repeat. Come in number five. Oh! Row! Row, row! Come on, row! Row! Come on. We've lost our team, you miserable bugs. 15 lashes for the lot of you. Careful. Bunch of idiots. Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. Come on, luci. Come on! I recall a nice looking pair of... Which? The fella isn't bad looking either. Do you think the young fella would mind if I inspected his jacket? You think so? Come on, luci. Get off! Anything the matter? What do you think? Leave her alone! Get stuffed. Get stuffed. Leave her alone! Would you like to watch what goes on? Timothy. Timothy, don't go too far now. Timothy, come back. You're too easy, love. Too easy. As for you, you little pansy. I'll kill you. I'll kill you! Nick, you all right? Nick! Say something, Nick. You did it on purpose. You knew what they're after don't you? I did not. My father's right, boarding school will do you good. What do you mean? What do you mean? Yes, they're sending you away. You're lying! You're lying, you're lying! Luci, what is it? Luci, what's happened to you? I was attacked. You were what? Darling... Darling, tell me. Some fellows. There were four of them by the river. They were fooling around, for laughs, you know. Then suddenly... Oh, it was horrible. Luci, darling. Tell me what happened. It became vicious, especially one of them, vicious. Darling what happened? What happened? Nothing really happened. It was just... Oh, my darling. Men are horrible. Filthy. I hate them. Amy? Don't let Robert send me to boarding school, will you? Would you like to be with other girls? No, Amy. No, I want to stay here. I won't let him send you away. I wouldn't. I'll speak to Robert. And you speak to Robert, be nice to him. Robert? Could you please come up a moment? Please? I can't very well shout from here. Come up, please, it's important. If it's that important, you come down here. Robert? Well? What do you want? No, it doesn't matter, you're busy. Come on, what is it? You're sure you can spare the time? Yes, I can spare the time. These nightmares, every night. That's why I can't sleep. I'm frightened, Robert. Luci, for somebody of your age, you've experienced emotions which you can't understand. Now, these dreams always involve your mother, right? Yes, mum, always. And she gave you a rough time, didn't she. No, no, she loved me! Oh... She said I was the only reason she was stuck in that rotten, stinking house. She called me a little blonde bastard. She wasn't always like that. She was, luci. Oh... What's the matter? I haven't mentioned it before. It's always there, this pain in the back of my head. There? Yes. I suspect it's there as well, right? Yes. Nervous tension, luci. That's all it is. Your nervous system is like, like strings which can be stretched and stretched. It's evitable that the shock of your mother's death should leave a Mark. We're doing the best we can to make you forget. And be happy. Will you, Robert? Will you make me happy? Don't you think I'm attractive? Cover yourself up. But I love you, Robert, I love you! Cover yourself up! Oh! My god, you are like your mother. - Lam, am 1? - Yes, you are. Just like her. Now, get up! Oh, Nick, don't, no, please! Don't touch me! Please, Nick, don't let them take me away! I said don't touch me! Look, I saw you downstairs! You're a bitch, you're a bitch! For being a naughty girl, luci. For spying on your mum, luci. I told you to stay out til 10. What did you see? Answer, what did you see? What are you, like a spy? Mum? Forgive me, mum. You never said, "I love you," mum, not once. I tried to make you say it, but you never. And now you're sorry, and can't get up. Come on, mum, just like this. Mum? Mum? Nicky? Nicky? Say something, Nicky, please. Say something. Oh, Nicky. Stop pretending! Nicky! Robert, Robert! Just pull yourself together, Amy, just pull yourself together. What are we going to do? Amy. The pearsons are going to be here soon. Look, it's no good for him, he already left. I can't go through with it, Robert, I really can't. We can do nothing. It's five to seven now. They'll be here in less than an hour. Anyway, basic concussion, that's all it is. We'll be home here in a couple of days. First thing in the morning I'll get rid of her. She has to go. She has to go. I said you're right. She must go! She's got to go, I can't have her here. For the sake of all of us, you must get rid of her, Robert. She can't stay here. I told you to stay with Mrs. Carmichael. Now, get up to your room! Want to play with your little doll? Get up to your room! Don't you want to play with your little doll? Luci, please. Don't you want to play with your little doll, Amy? Robert? Bobby? - Ah. - Hello, Harry. Hello. Tessa's in the car. Where's luci? Oh, she's not coming, Harry. She's got a bad headache. Has she?
