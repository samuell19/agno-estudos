The Sound of the Earth Shaking One passes many times through the same path it repeats, if one looks through the window the same square, the same hour And it's never equal and yet always the same One does not recognize it. When I slightly lift my head, I see a garden from my window in which I haven't noticed it well since now. On the right, there's a wood losing its leaves. Beyond the garden, the plains. On the left, a swamp of which I'll talk again. In the past, the garden was planted with roseries and bougainvillea. But now, because of the neighboring swamp the rushes and the moss invaded everything. The grass made the paths disappear. There is only the great alley left. Where I used to sit after lunch listening to the dogs and the voices mixed in the distance. Now I can only distinguish grey spots. And in the distance, a collapsed tower that reminds me of a boat chimney. Alberto, are you writing? Yes Jean-Pierre! It's the story of a man in a land surrounded by swamps. Are you going to Isabel's place later this evening? I came from there. What are you writing? -"The Sound of the Earth Shaking". -What's that? It's a book. More confessions? -Not really. -So, what is it? I tell you. It's the story of someone who cannot travel. Like a shepherd who tells another his land is full of rocks and swamps. But lives happy nonetheless. He takes what we can from the land and does no try to leave. and does not what to exchange it for another one. It's the story of a sailor. Who is happy about the simple fact the days go by, one after the other. He got very little. But his happiness is made of that little he got. The boat... the sea... The sun that is reborn every day. He fishes by line from the watch of his bunk. On the first day, he fishes four mullets and eats one. On the second day... ...he decides to start a journal. Writes the first page. On the third day... ...eats another mullet. On the fourth day... ...he tries to fix his bunk according to his earthly desires. I see... The sailor would not exchange this joy for any other. But I don't know how to invent. All of this was already written. By many others, long time ago. Well before me. And why not by you? Excuse me, but I cannot stay longer. I just passed by to ask if you're going to Isabel's place, later this evening. Cipriano says he's coming too. -Ah, Cipriano. -Yes, Cipriano. See you later. Cipriano... Aren't you going out, master? Maria, I must discipline my actions. to manage my time in an intelligent way. I'll follow an agenda. I'll write each day... ...what I'll will do along the week. I'll preview each day seven days in advance. That will assure the success of my acts. So, I'll wake up before each unknown day... ...but that was already decided by me in advance. I'll divide this agenda in two parts. In this part, I'll write what I have to do. and in this one... ...what I did in fact. Will you need anything more, master? Get up at six o'clock. To think about Cipriano's personality. Go to the port. Spend the night at Isabel's place. What did you do today? -Nothing. -Nothing? -Nothing? How come? I'm writing a book. It's called: "The Sound of the Earth Shaking". Tell me about it. Before I explain my book to you... ...I would like others to explain it to me. It's difficult if you don't tell me anything about it. I was trying to explain it to Jean-Pierre a little while ago. And each time I try to explain it... ...I lose its meaning. It's simple... Simple? Was anything ever simple with you? It's the story of a man who lives in a swamp and does not make any efforts to get out. On the contrary, he is contented with it. -Is that all? -No, I tell what he does there. And what does he do? He looks at the sea, in the distance. It's a sailor. It's called Luciano. Luciano... Luciano is not unhappy with his life. For him it's enough to look at the gulls. behind the boat... with their wings, sometimes white, sometimes black. But, a slight change in weather... and everything changes. Luciano likes to fish. From the watch of his room lines multiply. But he never catches anything. He never catches anything by necessity. I don't understand... By necessity, he never catches anything? Why? What is that? That? I also don't know what that is. One always says more than that. And that is what interests me the most. What we put into something, without knowing the reason. A sort of unconsciousness what I like to call "the part of God". -I only know that Luciano can't catch anything. -Why? Because it's like that. Why do you write? Maybe to act, I don't know. And what if, by chance, Luciano would catch something? It would not be Luciano, but another truth. One day you have to read me what you've written. I can read it now. I got some notes here. "Luciano's journal" "On that day, fields turned into blackberry coloured seas." "Of all the landscapes, I prefer the plains." "It was all so short." "Long months on the sea, flew away like brief days." "Hours cannot have more weight on those who lived" "an instant that focused on all their lives." "Of all the plains I prefer the most monotonous." "Long voyages would I make" "just to find places made of nothing but swamps." "To find countries of stagnant waters." "I'm not sad." "I'm not even melancholic." "I'm Luciano, the loner." "And I like a landscape, like a book." "Because it doesn't distract me from my thoughts." "My thoughts are sad." "They are slow and prolonged." "They are what I love above all." "When I let them wander" "Above all I look for plains..." "swamps... heaths..." "lands of still waters." "Why are my thoughts so sad?" "I asked myself that so many times..." "From my window I see a garden, from which I haven't noticed it well since now. "A wood with no leaves." "After that garden... the plain..." "And next to it, the swamp..." I don't know why, but that scares me. Go on. These are just loose notes. It's nothing. Just vague ideas, notes. Listen: "extensions of the river mosses." "the indecision of reflexes." "seaweeds, moss, and carps that swim by." "To avoid calling them 'opaque stupids' ". Opaque stupids? What does that mean? Some people have called carps that. Do you want to listen more? It's nine o'clock. Jean-Pierre is coming with his friends. He is going to read some poems. Will you stay, Alberto? Jean-Pierre? What will he read? It's not "The sound of earth shaking". I will get ready. You'll read me the rest later. What you've read is beautiful. I only fear is a little monotonous. So goodbye. I'll go home. Why won't you stay? The people who are coming would love to see you. No. I don't feel like being with other people. Maybe tomorrow. Luciano smiles. Will you need something, master? I don't need anything. I want to be alone. I need to work. "Descend until the low mud flat." "To know the emotions I feel before delicate, Grey things." "To visit the interior of a ship." "Wake up ate six?" "Wake up at nine!" Cipriano... He married a woman poorer that him, called Noemi. Thanks to a big financial application, he managed to leave the poor condition he was in, after his father's death He deserves all my esteem. It's not easy to get rid of esteem like the one he has for me. One day, when he told me he knows me perfectly I wished I had never met him. -Dad, tell me a story. -Ok, I tell you. "Some ants from the colony of the oak root" "an earthworm that lived under a rock, next to the river" "a beautiful beetle and other animals that lived in that place." "The chatty frog, as soon as she saw herself surrounded," "dried her tears and tried to cheer the assistance" "with a happier subject." "She stood on top of a stone and said, with a loud voice:" "'My friends, don't you know an animal so squat and soft'" "'called a frog?'"" "'Once I saw that ugly animal'", "replied the small lizard, wiggling her tail." Cipriano thinks I'm incapable of any bad action. And sometimes that stops me from acting. His concept of pity suffocates me. He does not take into serious account what I do. He never reads what I've written. Mr. Cipriano is outside. Tell him to come in. I was just thinking of you. Come in. I came to ask you a favor. I thought you should be free. I need two witnesses for the deed of the house. Jean-Pierre will go directly to the notary. If you could... we'll go now. I have to be back in the office by noon. I'll tell you what it is on the way. It's not even 10 o'clock. I think we have time. I also have to be on the mud flat before noon. The mud flat? The lower one? Yes. I need to observe the insects afloat on the water. I want to discover how mosquitoes, larvae dragonflies might be connected with the idea of writing this book. You know, I'm writing a book. It is... I didn't even explain why we're here. Jean-Pierre must be there already. After all, you didn't show up yesterday. Isabel told me that tonight you'll read about this so called Earth shaking. Shh... Not now, later. I will be there... I cannot talk about my book to Cipriano I can't do it. I want to, but I can't. Cipriano... Luciano... It's impossible to tell him the story of Luciano. What Luciano? It's true. I didn't tell you. Luciano is the sailor of my book. By the way, yesterday I told you he fished four mullets. I already changed that. It's impossible. Luciano never catches anything. He is not a vulture. One of the oldest memories I have it's about a dream when I was a boy, in which a vulture flew above my bed and opened my mouth with his beak. biting and hurting me... Isn't it horrible? But Luciano isn't a vulture. It's like a bird that flies up and when he descends, he rests. because in the descents the wings don't move. Looks at the light and admires its beauty. Only the one who is in perpetual motion can see it, after closing its eyes. Isabel...Isabel... Isabelle, this particular way of listening that only she is capable of. She is like the mirror of our voice. How long does she live in that place? After all, so little things change. All stories are so similar. "Nature, nothing of you moves me." "not the nourishing fields" "nor the rosy echo of Sicilian countrysides" "nor the pomp and ceremony of sunrises, nor the dolorous solemnity of sunsets." "I laugh at Art, I laugh at Man also." "at songs, at verse, at Grecian temples." "and at the spiral towers thrust by cathedrals into the empty sky." "and I regard with the same eye the good and the wicked." "I do not believe in God" "I abjure and disavow all thought" "and as for that ancient irony, Love," "I curse anyone who speaks its name to me again." Why disturb Isabel's peace? Where will we reach if stagnation follows blindness?" Won't that be sadder? Jean-Pierre told me he can't come by my place later than six o'clock. Cipriano is waiting for him. Be it. Maybe that will change things. Let's hope God will not measure Man's efforts by the poor results he obtains. You aren't you going to ask me again what I did today, are you? What did you do today? Two people... waiting in the street one happening and the apparition of the main actors. The happening follows and the actors are themselves. I've been with Jean-Pierre. He left here some time ago. We never meet in here. It's you who runs away. You always miss one another Alberto, Alberto, believe me. There's nothing that finds me. Everything bores me, disgusts me. My former enthusiasms when I think of them, they immediately fade away. Now, when I measure them they seem so petty, so cheap... Do you want to know? Sometimes, at night in bed, I started to digress. And for brief moments, I was happy. A half dream in which I saw glory, love, the ecstasies. Today, I don't even understand that. I don't know which dreams to fetch. I pilled up the best ones, and even those bore me. They are always the same. It's impossible to find others. It's not just the things I have, or that I had, which tire me. I'm also bored by the things I don't have. Because in life, as in dreams, it's always the same... Tomorrow night, some writers are coming. Don't you want to come? If you come, you'll see Jean-Pierre. Men of Letters. The ones I saw this afternoon are enough. Do you know who did I also find today? Luciano The lonely sailor? Yes. But he's not a sailor, not even a loner. he's a bookkeeper. He's married, father of four sons. He is called... Cipriano! Was he also here? So, your story was a lie, after all. Would it be truer if he was fishing by line with his wife and four kids? To achieve truth, one has to compose. Artifice is mandatory. The important thing... is emotion. And what if emotion is false? No, Isabel! Emotion is never false. Have you never heard that error comes from judgment Do you want to see what Cipriano really does in reality? Tell me. But what is going on? What's wrong with you? It's pages and pages of copies from the office. Did anybody say he would do anything else before he dies? From the wedding, he learnt about love. Kids love him. Sunday night they all play lotto. Ah, Isabel, Cipriano! Everything in his life was invented to fill up holes. Everything! Even his family! But don't misunderstand me. Cipriano is an astonishing man. And what is most astonishing is that he's a happy man. But what are you like this? Why are are you crying? Don't worry. Isabel, don't you think that true life is missing from our lives? What can I do? What can we do? I had an idea. Let's make a trip together. Sunday? Is that ok? Sunday? Tomorrow! We'll leave really early. Why not? I'm going home. I need to sleep. You tired me. You can stay here. Your bedroom is ready. No, Isabel. I'm not staying. I want to go to my place. Tomorrow, I come to fetch you. I need to write a lot before I sleep. See you tomorrow. Wake up at six. Try to vary up the emotions. To reflect about Leonardo's sentence: "Painting is mute poetry..." "... and poetry is a blind painting." Time is fast. He is the great devastator of created things. In the old days, earth had a square shape, and the sea and the fire ran on its surface. That is why, in the high mountains we still find things that come from the salty waters remaining tears left by the old tides. But the fast time crossed the invasion of the earth. And from the old seas, there were only streams, always higher than rivers, drying until the surrounding air that covers the earth will be deprived of the water it necessitates. We'll lose the renovation of the plants, animals will die. I've already forgotten these birds. The wolves. So much time at sea that we even forget they exist. Lions and birds of prey. It seems we've arrived. They will not find their victims anymore. The sea is endless. And we only have one night on land. It's time enough to finish everything. She will disappear from earth at last, leaving it sterile and dry of imagination. And when fire will consume the water enclosed in its belly, earth will be covered with ashes. and will be naked. -Let's see? -What? What will happen to those, when it's "your end of the world"? What end of the world? They cannot move because they have an inverse skeleton. One day somebody told me these animals weren't born in the sea. They were dragged to the coast by a great deluge. In Italy, there are some of its fossils in the high hills. They were born out and far from sea. It's me who wasn't born in the sea. I will not spend the day here. Let's go. I'll stay. It's up to you. I prefer to go along these streets, to find a chick before she changes coop. Maybe a chick or a vulture will find me before that. As you wish. We'll see each other this evening. You can keep the rest. Where are the trains going? To the beach. What times do they leave? All the time. Every half hour. I know now, that neither from the heat of light, nor from the coolness of night comes help. What do I feel? Now I know about time of all the things that slept in me and of my heart with them. I know about the earth, the flowers in the grass. Of my path to the rock full with roses. Of the loving elm in the many falls of the night in which the clouds don't come back like smokes in the distance. Love only exists in those that already have them inside. Because we exist alone and I don't know how to say it to you. I possibly dreamt. Take my hand. Close your eyes. Do you feel my hand? But do you know it's me? Are you going away, master? Yes. For a long time? No. Just for 2 or 3 days. I need to get some rest. Let me help you. Don't bother. Everything is ready. Everything? What time is it? I need to leave now. Mrs. Isabel is waiting for me. Mrs. Isabel? Yes. What's the matter with you? Nothing. Ok. Goodbye. Goodbye. Alberto? Just a second. Have you got any rooms available? How many days? Just a couple of hours. I need to rest. Second floor. There's no elevator. Telephone Isabel to postpone the trip. Cipriano called me. He needs me. -And you? -I walked around. Doing what? I don't know... I can't remember... I walked through many streets, on the adventure, in faraway neighborhoods, I walked a lot. People must have thought I was looking for someone. You are really strange. Did you spend the night well? Did you notice that girl was barefoot, just sandals and golden nails? So tall and so thin... I didn't quite notice. I remember her legs carved... Her hair of a dirty blond colour. Thin... we could see across her red shirt... Well, you saw her. Her legs awakened brutal desires. One only wanted to bite them, full of muscles. Firm, like the legs of a man. And you? I think I will still go for another tour. We only leave at the end of the day. Me, I'm going to sleep. Isabel, I remembered the swamp. The swamp... the bogs. I know that Alberto used to go there. I'll go there and look for them. Gulls... Its wings, sometimes white, sometimes black... What we put into something without knowing why... This sort of unconsciousness... that I like to call "the part of God". sometimes white... sometimes black... Stagnant waters... Land... I look for plains above all Tomorrow... With Isabel. It doesn't matter, provided that he pays. They ask a room for some hours... and end up staying for days and days. There are such crazy ones... They say he doesn't leave the room even to eat... So strange... You remind me... of a person.... It was many years ago. I was abroad, visiting a museum, alone. I stopped in front of Ottan's "The Virgin" which is one of my favourite paintings. I looked at the painting for a long time. and suddenly I noticed a woman who was in front of me who was also looking at the painting. I don't know why I wanted to talk to her aloud. To talk with her. About the painting. And I told her about the red in the Virgin's mantle, of the green of the kneeler's cover, where the painter is, in adoration, of the boats one can see in the distance, on the river, through the open arcades. I remembered having talked for a long time about the angel's wing, on the right the angel that holds the Virgin's crown. I didn't know if she was listening or not, if she was even understanding the language in which I was talking to her, if she knew what I was telling her about the painting. But I didn't care about that. I just wanted to talk. She was with her back to me all the time looking at the painting. I talked for a very long time. When I stopped, she went into the next room without turning her back. And I was there all alone, watching the painting. I have remembered that encounter a lot of times. Or instead, that non-encounter. But I think it was not by chance that we were there for such a long time Me, talking about van Eyck, and she, listening... or non-listening. I think it could never have been by chance. In fact, as someone I don't know says, chances are the only things which don't happen by chance. And it's not only with people, with books also. I think one reads the book one should read at the time one should read it. A long time ago, I remembered having read a text by a French author. I am always remembering it. He also believed in this sort of predestination and gave his own example: when he was a kid he had found a reference to Jean-Paul in some book. That name, just like that, without family name intrigued him. He found it strange and fascinating. Who was that man so well known that he didn't need any more names? He was ashamed to ask his parents and teachers. He looked in the encyclopedias. There was nothing in Jean, nor in Paul. He accepted that one day he would discover who he was. Then, later one, already a man, he found a job in a bookshop as clerk. One day, he was on the top of a crate, organizing the books on the top shelf and, suddenly, a book fell. He looked at this book in German and it was by Jean-Paul. The writer didn't know a single word in German but we has so fascinated with this discovery that he read the book, checking each word, one by one, using a dictionary. Later he learnt German. And became one of the most regarded specialists in German Literature. As he said, that name, that book the encounter with that name and that book changed all his life, determined all of his existence. You must have heard already about "automatic reading" and "automatic writing." I also believe in a sort of automatic encounters. One of the most astonishing examples of communication I know, it's of a couple that, one day, got angry with each other, due to a banal reason, and spent an entire day without talking. And after that, a week and a month. They spent years without talking to each other. They lived together 40 years, without talking to each other. He lunched at home every day, and the same thing at dinner, slept at home every day and they didn't speak. They communicated through the servants. Like: "Ask Master to pass me the salt". "Tell Madam to hand me the sugar." Until one day he died. And before dying, all the family was there He asked: "are your all here?" His wife was there, but once again she didn't reply. until someone understood the situation and said: "we're all here." At that moment he smiled and fell asleep. And died that night. Are you a Catholic? Did you have a catholic upbringing? If so, you must remember this story as I do, which priests used to tell about the imitation of Jesus Christ, that if we opened the book at hazard one always found the exact answer for the problem we had at the moment. And it's really true. And not only with the imitation of Jesus Christ, it's with all the books. One opens a book at hazard, and hazard gives us the answer we want and which we need to have. But one needs to merit the hazards. Alberto. Do you know anything? No, I don't know anything. He comes back tomorrow. How past extends itself... There is something which I can't understand. Which I can't understand no more. Sorry Mrs., but I don't know anything more. Let's hope God doesn't measure Man's efforts by the poor results he gets. Tomorrow... Tomorrow... I want to tell what I feel, and don't know what to tell. I would rather know your name... Without looking for you, I found you and I know now that not even from the heat of light, nor from the coolness of night, comes help. Arts or ruses aren't needed. Now, I know of time. And of all the things that laid dormant inside me and of my heart with them. Now, I know of time. and of all the things that laid dormant inside me and of my heart with them. The flowers in the grass... I know of the Earth... of my path to the rock full with roses. of the loving elm in the many falls of the night where the clouds don't come back, like smokes in the distance. I wanted to be made of thyme, the smell of saffron. To sleep in the seasons of the year. Climb many mountains. Walk through new paths every morning. I notice now the cold of the rock walls. The mother that receives in her arms. The house shakes with my steps and the floor resonates. Near, the mountain resonates. I remember. Now I know that love only exists in those who already have them inside. Because we exist alone and I don't know how to say it to you. And if it's true what of myself I saw in you I wait for you. I want to accept you. I must leave tomorrow. What do I feel? Now I am alone. Possibly, I have dreamt. Now I recognise the rough animal from the countryside. But I want. Come. Luciano. I dedicate this film to Antonio Orlando
