It was either this or investment banking. [chuckles] [dog barks] [siren wails] Billy's not coming. - Yeah, he is. Yeah, he is, that info was solid. - Well. It's gonna be another long night.

[dark ambient music] You know what I like, and you know what I want. And you know why I came. - Look, he's back in three weeks. Every three weeks, always on a Friday. That's why they call him Three Fridays. He'll be on Fourth Street, Downtown Vegas. He's gonna have about a pound of junk on him. - Mm, you sure about that? - Look, it costs me a lot to get this for you, you know. - Ah, stop your bitchin'. What'd you think I'd forget you? No, I got what you need, baby. - Something's goin on. [suspenseful music] [door creaks] - Yep, that's Billy. - Barnett, this is Sean. - Did really good. - [Sean] Barnett, this is Sean.

Don't die on me, Lyle. Lyle, Lyle! [Billy groans] Fuck you. - Come on, go ahead. - Sean! Sean, Ellen, Frank. - You fuck! - Holster that gun. - Ellen, check Lyle. Holster the gun, Sean! Don't do this! Don't let him bring you in. Think of your family. Think of your daughter, Sean, please. - You don't wanna go out like this, man. - Shit, fuck! Where the hell were you? - You were supposed to wait for back up. You know it was goin' down before midnight. You were supposed to be here! - Don't lay this on me, mister. You know protocol. Now you wait for back up, that's the deal. - You should've been here. Fuck. - Let him go, let him cool down. Let's get these guns out of here. Yeah, let's call an ambulance, let's get this guy wrapped up. [rhythmic electronic music] - [Officer] All right, step lively boys. - [Man] Closing the RV.

Patch me to Sean Walker, will you? He's on the desk duty. - Sean, Barnett's on line two. [radio chatters] [phone rings] - This is Walker. - Sean, now don't hang up, it's me. We gotta talk. - Barnett, what do you want? - Listen, do yourself a favor, just meet me. I got something, it's about the shooting. To be honest, it's something your partner Lyle would have appreciated. - If you have somethin' to say, why don't you just say it? - Look, the phone's heavy here. I don't wanna take any chances. I've got somethin' to show ya that'll make everything all right. Take five minutes out of your life. - Where? - Go left on Flamingo Road, go to Casino Road, and you know those high towers over here, I'll be here, just show up. - One hour. Barnett, this better not be bullshit. - Great, fuckin' puss. Ah! [bottle shatters] [gun clicks] Hey, hey, Sean, you made it! Hey, did you hear about Internal Affairs clearin' you? - You called me all the way out here for that? That's not your car. Whose car is it? What's goin' on, Barnett? - Hey, cool down, okay Sean? I'm just here to help you out. I'm just here to help you. - What did you do? No, no. I don't want anything from you. You just think this is a fucking joke, don't you? - No, it's not a joke, Sean, no, no, wait, stop, don't go away! I heard what you were sayin' about me. If Barnett would've been there, Lyle would've been alive. Are you sure you wanna be on my bad side? On my bad side? - Fuck you, and fuck your bad side. - Why you talkin' like that? Now you listen to me, and you be smart. Every asshole's out there tryin' to put a bullet in me. What do you think we're doin' out here? We take down bad guys. That's who I am, that's all I am, and I just do it. And I don't give a shit how it's done. - Do you listen to the shit that comes out of your mouth? You're drunk, man! All you think about is yourself and promoting your career, that's it! - And how about your career, Sean? You got your head so shoved up your ass, you don't care about your files, you don't care about anything. All you care about is that fuckin' wife of yours, and that kid-- [punch thuds] [Barnett groans] - What's this, huh? Huh, what's this? You gonna shoot me with this, huh? - Sean, take it easy, will ya? This is not what you think it is, all right? This is not the way it was supposed to go down. All right, Sean, take it easy. - What the fuck is goin' on? - Sean, you need redemption. You need redemption for what happened. - Yeah, damn right I do. My partner's layin' in a grave, and you're still alive. - Well, welcome to fuckin' Las Vegas, Sean. It's one-sided here, Sean. In case you didn't know, the rules in dice still load against the good guys. And you know what, being right doesn't give you a bulletproof vest. - What the fuck are you talkin' about? - I got somethin' for ya, right here in this trunk. - What's in the trunk? - You got the gun. - Open it, open it. - All right, take it easy, Sean. [lock clunks] That's Three Fridays.

What kind of a cop are you? Who made you fuckin' judge and jury? - You know what, just do me a favor and shoot the scumbag! Who gives a shit about him! Shoot him! What's wrong with you? Come on, it'll make you feel better! [punch thuds] - Now I feel better. Get up. Let's go, come on. - [Barnett] You're gonna let him go? - [Three Fridays] What you gonna do? - It's your lucky day. Get the fuck out of here, let's go, go. - [Barnett] Sean. I'll see you later Three Fridays. - I'll get my redemption. But I don't need you or this badge. - Sean, you're just gonna walk away from this. That's what you're gonna do? Come on, this is not how I wanted this. [door clunks] [engine hums] Ah, man!

Ralph will have my badge if he finds out. [sirens] - Barnett? When the fuck do you care what Barnett thinks? - Man, it's Captain Barnett now. - No. You gotta be kiddin' me. - After that last cocaine bust, he's the department's golden boy. - Ah, I wonder how many people he had to hurt to get to be captain. - You come down here to dig up the past or fill me in on Billy Hagman? - No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. So, how did he escape? - Prison transfer. Killed two guards on the way out. Look, you know him better than anybody. Any idea where he might go? - Man, as soon as the bodies start pilin' up, that's where you're gonna find him. - I'm serious, Sean. Look, I called you because I thought you had a right to know. And maybe you could help us get a handle on this guy before things get out of control. Now you wouldn't be holding anything back, would you? - Frank, that was 10 years ago. Man, anything I got now is like past the sell by due date. - Oh, fuck. - You two ladies better be havin' a picnic out here. Sean, Sean, you're back! What, are you here paying some parking tickets? What are you here for? What's up? Hey Frank. I told him not to call ya. But I knew he would, and I figured you'd show up. Let me tell you something, buddy. This doesn't concern you. You stay away from this. - He killed my best friend. - This is not gonna work out the way you think it's gonna work out. You are not a cop anymore, got it? Not a cop. You go back to your ranch, play with your piggies, your donkeys, or whatever you gotta do. You stay away from this case. Am I clear? I said, am I clear? Good. Frank. Guess what you get to do. You get to come to my office. That's right. You two ladies have a nice day. - Well, that was smooth. - Guy's an asshole. - Yeah, well he's my problem now. How's Samantha? - She's good, she's good. We're no longer together, but she's good, thanks. - Oh man, I'm sorry to hear that. - Yeah, that's all right. You know, things happen. - And your daughter? How's she doing? - Ah, she's great, she's great. Gettin' big. I see her in the summer, so I'm pickin' her up in a couple of weeks. [uptempo electronic music] - Jess! Jessica! Jessica! Jessica! - Hi, Mom! Oh, there you are. This is Michelle. She works in the office. As it turns out, she's going to the convention in Vegas, too, so I thought we'd all ride together this afternoon. - But Mom! - I don't have time to argue about it. We leave in an hour. - But-- - Do I have to pack for you? - No, I'll do it. - Okay. Oh, and don't forget your riding clothes. - I won't. - Relax, take your time. I'll keep your mom occupied while you say your goodbyes. - Thank you. - Oh, and you better let him up for air. [young man gasps] - I thought I was gonna drown. - Get outta here! [Samantha sighs] - I worry about that girl. - Why? - Because she spends so much time alone. - Didn't you when you were that age? - No, I was with her father. I just worry that she's not gonna meet anybody. - I don't think you have to worry about that. So, how's your husband? - We're separated. - I'm so sorry. I knew you were having problems, but. - Yeah, I guess some things weren't meant to be. [midtempo electronic music] [woman yells playfully] [woman laughs] [suspenseful music] - [Woman] Oh! [couple gasps and moans] [man groans] - Ah! God! Babe, you were gone for a very long time. He doesn't mean anything to me. You're still my man.

I got that address for you. - Okay, hold on, hold on a second. Now, all right, go ahead. - 3000 South Valley View Boulevard, apartment 3C. Sean, don't fuck me on this. Now, if there's anything we should know, you call it in, all right? - If anything comes up, I swear to you, I'll let you know. All right, thanks man. [engine hums] [phone rings] - [Jesse] Hello? - Hey Jesse, it's Samantha. Is Sean there? - [Jesse] No, he just drove off. Didn't say where he was goin'. - Okay, well something came up. and I wanted to know if I could bring Jessica a couple days early. - [Jesse] She's welcome anytime. - Good. All right, I'll see you tomorrow, then. - [Jesse] Lookin' forward to it. - Bye. All right you guys, let's go! Jessica, cheer up, it's not the end of the world. - Everything sure seems that way when you're young. I expect you'd much rather be hanging out with your friends now, wouldn't you, Jess? - Thanks. Will you at least make an effort for your father when we get there? - Hey babe. Where's that cocktail? - Hey, cuz. - Get your ass downstairs. Billy. - Lookin' good. [gulls caw] - I thought you were dead. - Not yet. - Saw that fuckin' cop shoot you, man. - Yeah. He's my next stop. [sighs] You've spent it all, haven't you? - I know what this must look like, but bro, you gotta know that ain't the way it is. - Tell me what it's like. - Everybody gotta live a little, you know? Have a place to stay. I mean, look at this shit. It's all right, isn't it? Nice, isn't it? [suspenseful music] - This really hurts, TC. You're family, I trusted you. - You listen to me. They put you away for life. What did you expect me to do? - I expected you to be loyal. To take care of my girl, lay low, be smart. Wait, but you're fuckin' greedy. - Fuck it. You know, I got this boat, Ferrari. I mean, you're back. Cheers, man, take it. - I will. [punch thuds] [TC moans] Woo! Get more rope, more rope around his fuckin' neck. Yeah, yeah. [water splashes] [gulls caw] - You just killed your cousin. - Fuck him. [woman squeals] [engine revs] [dark ominous music] [door knocks] - Hello? [phone beeps] Frank, yeah. You better get over here. [midtempo electronic music] [engine revs] [uptempo electronic music] - Wow! What a beautiful room. - I'm exhausted. - Anything else for you ladies? - No, thank you, but if there is, I'll let you know. - Well, I'm on till midnight, if you need anything. Anything at all, you know. Please let me know. - Okay. [women giggle] - He was cute. - Yeah, but I'm tired, I'm gonna take a nap. - You've been napping all the way. - But it was a long day. [Samantha sighs] - I'm gonna take a shower. [midtempo electronic music] - Wanna come out and play with me tonight? - Yeah. [siren wails] - And you found him just like? [radio chatters] Just like this, huh? - Yeah, I just think that. - [Man] Be careful, we got some steps, here. - Hey, Fucko. You better be delivering pizza. - Yeah, I'm passin' through. - Your mama's just passin' through. What are you smilin' at, huh? You think I didn't know you had something to do with this? - Hey, will you just stay off of Frank's case. I found the body, I called it in. - And how is that, Sean? You're just passing through? This better not have anything to do with Billy's escape. - Are you worried that I'm gonna catch Billy first and steal the headlines? - Hey, fuck you! - Hey, fuck you! - No, fuck you! - Hey, come on you guys. Cut this shit out, the press is outside. - Frank, shut up. You wanna dance with me? You're gonna lose. You will go down. Now you get off this case. - Listen, let me tell you somethin'. You wanna dance? You're gonna be dancin' on dead bodies. You want my information, I'm comin' along. - We got nothin' without his intel. - Both you guys. You got 60 seconds. - Billy had a girlfriend, Sadie Hastings. This was her place. - The body bag? - My best guess was it was a boyfriend. Didn't expect Billy to show up. - Tell me more about Sadie. - The night of Lyle's murder, somebody helped TC escape with the money. I figured Sadie'd be the getaway car. She must've shadowed Billy for the drop, followed us in the warehouse, picked up TC while we were takin' Billy down. - Who the hell is TC now? - TC is Billy's cousin. He was the second shooter in the warehouse, but we didn't have enough to make it stick. - Oh, oh this is beautiful. TC gets away with the money. Oh, this is good detective work. Why don't you two brainiacs tell me why Billy would come here and not go for the money first. - Well, if I was in jail a really long time, I'd probably wanna come here first, too. [playful instrumental music] - Yeah. All right, you got that address. I know you got that address. Wanna tag along? Let's go, Fucko. Come on. Come on! I said let's go. - I'm transferrin' to L.A. - [Barnett] Come on, let's go! [uptempo electronic music] - Hey guys, what's up. - Oh, Mom! Mom, Michelle asked me to go out to a nightclub. Can I go, please? - A nightclub? You're too young. - What, I'm 18, I'm practically legal. - Come on, Sam, let the kid have some fun. - All right, but you're responsible, and you, don't be home too late. - Oh, thanks! - Trust me. - Bye, Mom. - Bye, have fun. But not too much fun. [door clunks] - Babe. You must be so tired. I know something that's gonna perk you right up. - Yeah? - [Sadie] Yeah. [slap smacks] - That's for the guy I caught you with. - [laughs] I didn't even think you cared. - Yeah. - Oh! [midtempo electronic music] [uptempo dance music] - Welcome to The Little Buddha. Enjoy your evening. - I'm sure we will. [crowd chatters] Two shots of vodka, please. - My mom would never take me to a place like this. - That's why we're not gonna tell her. - Yeah, she drives me crazy. Sometimes I feel like she doesn't even know who I am. - I think I know who you are, and I think you need to have fun tonight. [phone beeps and rings] - Yes, can I have the bell desk, please. [uptempo electronic music] - [laughs] Can you believe those guys? Michelle, I had the best time. - I am so glad you had fun tonight. I hope you consider me your friend. [door clunks] [Jessica and Michelle laugh] - Good evening, ladies. - Looks like Mommy had fun tonight, too. - Couple of girls called it in this morning. - This your guy, Sean? - Shit. Yeah. - All right, this is my crime scene. Let's get Zervick down here, Simpson, Norris. Let's talk to everyone on the boats, get the history on this. The two girls, I want 'em at the station. They do not leave. Sean, you got something else for us? - No, Sadie and TC were the only names that I had. - You're not bullshitting me, you're not gonna be playing those games again, are you? - Look I wanna get this guy as bad as you do. But no, these are the only leads that I had. - Okay, bye bye with you. You're off the crime scene. You're useless, don't need you. - Wait a minute, wait a minute. Without me, you wouldn't have been here. - Exactly where are we? We got two dead bodies, Sean. They're not talkin' to us. Go back to your ranch, play with your donkeys. We're the cops, we'll take care of this. Off the crime scene. - Hey Sean, Sean, I'm sorry man. - [Sean] That's okay. - No hey, hey, don't let this asshole get to you. Look, if I find anything, I'll let you know. I'll call you, I promise. Man, I wouldn't lie to you. All right? [dark ominous music] [phone beeps] [phone rings] - Hello. - [Sean] Jesse, it's me. - Sean, where in the hell are you? Takin' off like that without a word. - [Sean] Yeah, I know, I'm sorry Jesse. - What's goin' on, Sean? - [Sean] I just got tied up with something I'm working on. I'm trying to take care of some unfinished business. - Well, you better hurry. Samantha's bringin' your daughter over here early. - I don't know what you guys did last night, but Jessica sure had fun. She hasn't stopped talking all morning. - She was good company. - Hey Mom, I'm ready. Let's get to Dad's. - What'd you do to my little girl? - What little girl? - Hey now. [midtempo electronic music] [engine revs] [radio chatters] - Hey buddy. I need a car. Any of those pieces of shit outside work? - Sorry, none of 'em are for sale. - Hm. [cane smacks] [dramatic music] - That's not what I asked you. [cane smacks] [cane smacks] - Woo! That's a good job, babe. - You hear that? Tend to 'em. - She's beautiful. - [Man] Thank you. - Would you like me to fill her up? - Please. - She must be very powerful. And it must take a big man to ride her. Obviously, you know your way around an engine. And I've been having problems with my accelerator, and I was wondering if you could take a look underneath the hood. - Absolutely. [suspenseful music] [pipe smacks] [man groans] - Yes! [giggles] I got us a ride. - Good girl. [horn honks] See who that is. - Holy cow, check this out. - Oh god. - Can I help you? - Yeah, 20 bucks, please. Thanks, sweetie. [chuckles] Freak. - Hey, do you have a bathroom here? - Nope. - Well, I think I'm gonna burst. - Yeah, I can tell. - Well, how do you manage? - How do I manage what? - You know, for relief. - Well, I could show you. - If looks could kill. Be right back. - Jessica, what's going on? - Nothing. - We were just talking. Why, what's it to you? - Get in the car. - Hey, hey. You don't have to do what your Mommy tells you to do. - Let go. Let go. Let go. - Let go of her arm. Let go of her. - Bye bye, Jessica. [uptempo suspenseful music] [engine hums] [engine revs] - Guess they didn't like the service. - Mm-hm. - Come on, baby. [door clunks] [engine revs] Yeah! [engine revs] Oh yeah, oh yeah. - Are you okay, Jessica? That was scary. [engine hums] [birds chirp] [horse whinnies] - [Jesse] Hi! - Uncle Jesse! - Hey, hey, you're happy to see me. - You have no idea. - Anything I should know about? - Eh, just some guy hassling Jessica. - Huh. Well, let's take a look at you. My, my, look at this. My grand niece is all growed up. - Yep. - My, you've turned into a beautiful young woman. You're pretty as your mama, beautiful as the sunset. - Jesse, this is my friend, Michelle. - Well, how do you do? A woman of your rare beauty is always welcome to my humble abode. - Oh, he's got quite the silver tongue, doesn't he? - Well, it runs in the family. Why do you think I fell for her father? Thanks for letting us come early. - Hey, no problem. I'm sorry Sean isn't here. He went runnin' off somewhere. - We should be going. - Hey, you just got here. Don't you have time for a quick trek? I know how much you like to ride. - Well, we could stay for a couple minutes. You wanna go for a ride? - Uh, not me. I'm a city gal. The only horses I like are under the hood of a Ferrari. - Well, there's the house. Make yourself at home. [dark ominous music] [phone rings] - Yeah. - [Frank] Sean, it's Frank. There's been a double homicide at the gas station near your ranch. I'm headin' out that way now. - Jesus. [engine revs] [horse whinnies] - Remember that pond over yonder back by that tree? - Oh yeah, I spent many a summer day in that pond. [Jesse laughs] - Yeah, I remember a little ragamuffin runnin' home after a long day's swim with Sean. - [chuckles] Not much has changed around here. How is Sean? - Oh, I think he still misses you. - Yeah, I bet he doesn't miss all the yelling and screaming. - Well, he was a wild thing back then. Seem to remember so were you. - Oh yeah. - Lyle's murder changed him. He's mellowed out. - What are you tryin' to do, get us back together? - Well, you were good together. - Yeah, in between fights. - You got a pretty young daughter to prove it. - Who thinks that she's all grown up. [horse whinnies] [suspenseful music] [phone rings] [dramatic music] - Who are you? - Who are you? - Michelle Atkins. Samantha's friend. - This is Jesse Walker's place, right? - Yeah. - Sean Walker's uncle. - You don't work here, do you? - You're very perceptive. - Then what are you doing in the house? - Waiting. - So why don't you join us. - I've forgotten how quiet it us out here. - [Jesse] You work up an appetite, girl? - That's good because we got a big mess of ribs back at the house. I don't wanna hear any of this crap about a New York diet or vegetarian stuff, either. - For you, Uncle Jesse, I'll give fresh-killed animal flesh a try. - Sounds like a deal. Let's go get it. - Don't listen to them, Dollar. Come on. [horse whinnies] [Michelle cries] - Oh come on. I know you like it. I can tell. - I don't think she wants to play with you, Sadie. You've lost your touch. - Oh yeah? Well, we'll just see about that. [Michelle sobs] - Well, let's go eat. - Yee-haw. [suspenseful music] [phone rings] - Come on. [phone rings] Come on, come on. - Oh, howdy. How can I help you folks. - Where's Sean Walker? - He ain't here. Who are you? - An old friend. When's he due back here? - I don't know. You want me to call him? - No, no. There's no rush. Besides, I'd kind of like to surprise him. Well, look who's here. - You know this guy, Samantha? - Yeah, that's the guy who was hassling Jessica. - Uh, you were hassling me. - That's enough, partner. Out of here. [gun fires] [women scream] - Oh my god. [Sadie laughs] Oh my god. [phone rings] - Don't move. - Shit! - What the fuck do you want from us? - I want your husband. - Why? - Let's see. He shot me. He put me in jail, he basically ruined my life, and now I'm here to return the favor. Honey. - Hm? - Why don't you go tie 'em up. - [laughs] Here, kitty kitty kitty kitty. Come on, you. - Are you all right? - Yeah. Mom, I'm sorry. - Don't worry about that now. We just gotta figure a way out of here so we can warn your father. Try your hands. - I can't. I can't get 'em loose. [Samantha groans] - All right, we'll figure something else out. - What if they come back? - Don't think about that right now, just try your hands. - Babe. How much longer are we gonna have to wait? - Till Mr. Walker returns. - But when is that until? - Quit whining, you're driving me crazy. We finish here when I deal with this prick, okay? No matter how long it takes. Now shut the fuck up, go inside, and leave me alone. Please. [door clunks] [suspenseful music] - Mm, mm, mm. I smell me some fresh meat, and I think I'm gonna get me some. - You stay away from her, you bitch. - Oh, what do you think you're gonna do about it, huh? Huh? There there, my sweet. Where were we. Oh, oh, oh, I know, it's so sad, so sad. Mommy's on the ground. Oh, don't cry little thing, don't cry. Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty little girl. Aw, little pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty girl. Ah. [Jessica sobs] [Sadie cries mockingly] Mommy, wah! She can't save you now, can she? [glass clatters] - Come on. Wah Mommy, my ass! Come on! [frenzied suspenseful music] [Jessica screams] Run! [gun clicks] [fist thuds] Hang on. Go in the shed. [tires screech] [Jessica gasps] - Is he coming? - All right, Jessica, listen to me. I'm gonna distract him, and when I do, I want you to run, and I want you to keep running, and I don't want you to look back, okay? - No, no, Mom, I don't want to leave you. - For once in your life, would you just listen to me? [horses whinny] - Girls, girls, girls. Hi. [board thuds] [Billy groans] [Samantha groans] [board thuds] [engine revs] [board thuds] [Billy groans] - Pretty, pretty girl. Nobody runs out on me, bitch! [Jessica screams] [gun fires] [Jessica screams] - It's all right, it's all right. You okay? You sure? All right, look. I want you to go in there, and I want you to lock yourself in there, all right? All right. [punch thuds] - Bitch. I'm gonna cut your fuckin' eyes out. [Samantha moans] - Billy! - Oh my god. - Let her go. - I was wonderin' how long I'd have to wait. Drop the fuckin' gun, or I cut her throat. Drop the gun. Drop the gun! Ah! [dramatic music] [men groan] - Mom! - Oh god, oh! [men groan] You son of a bitch, you! [punches thud] [punches thud] [men groan] [Sean yells] Get up! [punches thud] Now it's your turn! [guns fire] [sirens wail] [Jessica and Samantha whimper] - Sean! Sean! - Dad. - Hey.
