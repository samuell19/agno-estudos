You want to go out to sea with me? What if the coastguard shows up? What if they chase us? If they catch us, we're screwed. They can come from anywhere. We try not to get caught, we escape. When it's choppy, they don't go out. What can we do? We take a risk. Just that fish can get you in trouble? Of course! Even a little one. We're prosecuted for a single sturgeon. Is that an engine? Is it an islander? No idea, hard to say from here. But it's a big boat. The coastguard? Damned if I know. Shall we go then? Can't we throw the fish back? Let's go! We can't waste any more time. Let's bail. May God guide us home! Hi, Alina! Have you set off? I'll fetch you. Uncle Tolya, Alina is on her way. Alina, I'm picking her up. My daughter is back from town and school. Out of captivity! Ivan! Are you on Ostrov for holidays? The water's freezing! Come on, Ma. Shall we have a dip? Why couldn't you call your sister? Alina, sort out the packages you brought. This one's for Tatiana. It's your mother's birthday soon. I bought her cups, glasses, plates. The set cost 4.000 roubles. Big plates, dessert plates... It's a complete service. Knives, forks, big and small spoons. Teapot, sugar bowl. A complete set. OK, nice. So, this is my gift for her. You buy her a fan, then we're good. Easy, easy! Go on, have some more ice cream! No, that's enough. Sure? Ice cream on Ostrov, it’s a sensation! It is indeed! Eat up, before it melts. Do you want some more? He's full already! He has ice cream in town without me. Look at his cheeky grin. Alright, it's time to make lunch. Where's my sister-in-law? Hello. Happy Birthday! Look, I brought you flowers. Here, take this too. Thanks so much. Are we good for drinks? I'm so excited today! May we come together often. Let's fill those glasses! One glass won't give you a headache. A headache's for those who don't drink! Can you put the flowers over there? Happy birthday! Here's to your health! I wish you luck, joy and happiness. Don't quarrel for no reason. But everyone needs a little yelling. Thank you so much. I'm just so happy! As usual... Look how cute they are. They love the camera those clowns! Two young alcoholics. Happy birthday, Ma! Oh, dear Lord! Here's a big one from all of us. I wondered what was in that box. She can yell, but she has a good soul. All I want is you always by my side. Let's see what's in it. Don't cry. I can't believe it. It's a set of dishes. Why didn't you give it to me earlier? So lovely, I'd have used it today. Now I'll always have tea at your house. I have the same tea pot. Just look at this. Break a thing, mend your luck. Let's drink and break a glass! That's too many glasses to throw at each other! Your lovely husband arranged this. Come closer, I haven't kicked you out yet... but the door is still open! Come closer. Thank you. I don't know when will spring come, when rains will pass, and snow melt. But whatever the weather, this street will always be my home. My whole family is here. Take care of your husband. He is the head of the family. How difficult it is to live alone! I know, I take good care of him. So what if I yell? He works for us. He gets his ass kicked, but me too. But I also get flowers. It is both. But we love each other. The police may be there, and the coastguard. I don't know. I can't tell for sure. Anton, where are you? At Valera's? They are prowling... The cops. One, two, three, four... Who are these guys? A secret services commando. It's a mopping up operation. It's a routine visit. They come twice a week to check we're healthy and comfortable. You see how well they protect us? Federal Security Service, the real deal. Do they search houses? Yes, they check everywhere. They don't even knock? They go straight into the courtyard and shout: "anyone home?" They go in and go through your stuff. We always lock the door at night. If you do they just break it down. There's no way to stop them. Seriously? What right do they have? There are some empty houses here. They just bust the locks and get in. It all depends who's in charge that day. What if we're asleep? That's why they come at night. To surprise you in your sleep. You can't see who, only the eyes. They wear masks and carry guns. Okay, everyone is on the hill. Waiting for the boats to come in? Everyone's waiting for the fishermen to come back. Now we can only wait for Roman's return. He'll tell us what happened. Are a lot of the fishing boats out? Almost all went out this morning. Someone probably saw the coastguard. Some will have escaped, others not. Do you have any binoculars? What for? They're too far away. It's impossible even with binoculars. All you can do is wait, Tamangiz. Do you want some tea? No thanks. Juice? I'm OK, thanks. Your sweetheart will be back soon enough. Let's just hope for the best. Alina, any news? Were they caught? No, nothing happened. The coastguard is tearing the nets. Where is Roman? They came back empty-handed, no fish. Someone spotted the coastguard? Luckily, they were able to escape. Now the coastguard will tear the nets. We'll need to buy new nets. And so it starts again. Anton, I've prepared your nets. There you go, I'll put them here. They're ready to go. Is the sea calm today? So what? They're watching us. It's no good. Always the same thing. We're surrounded by water. We're an island, the sea feeds us. I don't get a salary, my wife neither. Fishing is our livelihood. No catch and we go hungry. We're deep in debt anyway. It's been 7 years, we can't pay it off. The coastguard says "Why are you here?" Leave. Russia is big enough. Go where? No one needs us. We could make a living here. If only we could fish! Now I live in fear of being caught. Then my family would have nothing. What about your son? Of course I'm afraid for him! He's young. He doesn't need a criminal record. I have one myself. You can't get a job or anything... I care about them. I'll stay anyway, my parents are buried here. Why should I go somewhere else? Help yourself to caviar. That's how we drink tea here! We used to pack caviar in 60kg barrels. Millionaires, we were! And now? Can you believe it? We're as poor as church mice. Because there's no authority here. No one cares if we live here. Tamangiz. I call her Tamangizka. Does she like it on the island? It must have been hard at first. She was a bit shocked, I guess. She kept saying "Where is Roman?" He'd be with Anton and she'd ask: For how long? Me: "He only just left" Won't be long! But she'd ask again. She's a city girl. Maybe she'll get him a job in town. They love each other. Thank God. Yes, it's dangerous. I'm afraid for him. But it's his choice. I can't stop him. He says he'll stop going to sea. And we'll settle in town. He definitely won't want to stay here. He wants to live in town. That's those coastguards. The ships can stay here for months. Then we can't go to sea. My only dream is to leave. To find a job somewhere. The government looks for itself. I look for myself. I live from day to day. Who knows what will happen tomorrow? I try not to think about it. You can drink to forget. That's it. Do you have a hammer, bro? Yes, I do. Not this one, the other one. I removed this once, you remember? Things break down all the time here. So we have to fix them. He fixes things for me, for others. I tell him, you should charge for it. But who could pay? We're all in the same boat. Immortal water, isn't it? If there were 100 or so people here, we could bring the issue to a head. The fishing licences, for example. The Federal Fishing Angency came to discuss building a pier. I'm excited about this idea. I'd be happy if we could work legally. You need a fishing licence? Yes, you need a licence. Anyway, nothing happened. Something went wrong as usual. You know the song: On the Isle of the Unfortunate no venture shall succeed. The crocs won't bite, coconuts won't grow. That's us. "Born on a Monday." But I do hope that someday... It's not like it's better elsewhere. Everyone has their problems. Nobody's having an easy life. It may look easy, but it's not. The authorities haven't abandoned us. Not entirely. But you’ve no roads, no electricity, no hospital, no administration. It's me, the administration. Yeah right, it's him. What's the problem? The administration is in place. It's functioning, the school is open, the coastguard is on duty. It all works fine. It works fine, but we have no work. Nowadays its peaceful, no shootings. There's law and order. The islanders like a peaceful life. Over 70 years have passed since the end of the terrible war started by the Nazis under Hitler. Without a declaration of war the German army entered the Soviet Union. Then came the great Day of Victory. Soviet soldiers marched and crawled thousands of miles to liberate the world, until they reached the Reichstag. When did the Great Patriotic War begin? 22 June 1939. No, when the Soviet Union was attacked. It was attacked in 1941. Why the "Great Patriotic War"? Because nearly 27 million of our people died. And when do we celebrate the Victory Day? 9 May. 9 May. It's not funny! You must know and remember it. Who won this war? The Russians. We won, of course. Only the Russians? All of them. Who's all of them? The whole Soviet Union! And who takes credit for this victory now? The Americans. The Americans, exactly. Hi guys, how are you doing? This is our flag, the tricolor. Russia, a generous soul. This is my grandfather. You know Uncle Tolya? It's his father. We clean and paint the memorial every year. If I didn't, someone else would. I always dreamed of being the head of Ostrov. Not only to get power, but to do something for our village. Surprisingly, I'm not the only one. An old friend of mine just returned after 29 years. Despite all the difficulties, he has no electricity, he's all alone, but he's happy. He's happy as a clam. For him, the island is paradise. Today is a special day in Donetsk, capital of the self-proclaimed republic. There is now a simplified passport process. Previously travel documents were only available in Ukraine. Now, new citizens receive Russian passports... and access to benefits, political and social guarantees. - It's like returning home. - When Putin announced this, we had an incredible feeling. A huge scandal involving Ukraine... ...Jewish organisations shocked by the events. There's only news about Ukraine. Neo-Nazi marches ahead of Holocaust Memorial Day... This is how Nazi storm troopers marched through German streets. Such a march is scandalous, participants bore symbols of the Hitler Youth and khaki shirts of almost similar shade. All coordinated with the Saxon police. This organisation claims contacts with Ukraine. In Kyiv they celebrated the Ukrainian Insurgent Army which collaborated with the Third Reich. Who needs this Nazism? How many were tortured and killed? I don't know... It was such a war. So many died. Our soldiers were not as brutal as the Nazis. I like the movies where we fight the Nazis. Young people don't like those films. I tell them it's all real, all true. Schwarzenegger playing the lone hero, that's a lie. What you see in our films, it happened. Let's stop talking about this. They're not interested. Anton doesn't like it. They know nothing about Grandpa Lenin. Stop it! They don't know anything about him. This bald little man, as they call him, he did a great thing. He made everyone equal. And now inequality is back. There's a divide between rich and poor. Some people have maids and servants. Next we'll be back to slavery, already are. This 'bald little man' made us all equal. He just made everyone equal. Come on! Enough. Now he's in the mausoleum in Moscow. He's an honoured man. Stop It now. I sense some resistance... Yes! Hitler kaput! Happy Victory Day! Attention! This is Moscow speaking! This is an important government announcement. Citizens of the Soviet Union! Today, on 22 June 1941, at 4am, without declaring war... German forces invaded the Soviet Union. Arise! Arise, great country! Arise for a fight to the death! Against the dark fascist forces, against the cursed hordes. May your noble rage sweep over them like a wave. This is the people's war, the people's sacred war. There is joy in every home on this, we celebrate the day of our victory! Happy Victory Day! Girls, look at the camera. Moscow! Red Square! Moscow is a heart that loves me. Golden fireworks. Moscow, Russia's glory. So it was and will always be. Russian people cannot be defeated. Think of all the failed attempts. It's all because of the people who live here. It's been over 70 years, but you see how patriotic people are. All the ceremonies, such emotion on our little island. Russians will always be Russians. We're an invincible people. Whoever tries to meddle, we keep going. Putin has given us powerful weapons. We've nothing to fear now. We were invincible and we still are. Where is everybody? They ran away. Everyone went home. Something's wrong here. Putin marched in the Immortal Regiment, bearing a portrait of his father. This tragedy marked almost every family. Both my father's and mother's sides. lost almost all of their brothers. It's worth a lot. 13,000 thousand soldiers took part, the best of the best. Some wear a Gold Star or an Order of Courage, military honours received in our time. - Comrade Supreme Commander-in-Chief, I admire your operation in Crimea. Well done! - Thank you. Well done! Hear that? Beautiful! Who else can march like that? Anyone would surrender after such a display. Putin praised the heroism of the Soviet people: This victory was claimed by all the people. The fortress of Brest faced the enemy first. They fought to the last man, and left a message on the walls that still resonates today. Kind of a vow, but also an order for us now. "I shall die, but I won't surrender." That's the song I want you to hear! Our time will come, we'll break any ice. Our time will come, we'll have our own jet. We'll fly to a place where we'll be happy. Maybe far away there's a planet of love. A place we'll be understood, where the cops won't get us. Hello! Uncle Tolya, it's me, Valera. Say something. He's squeezing my hand. Can we call a doctor? The doctor said to take him to a hospital. But how can we transport him by sea? No, it won't work. We'd just have to bring his body back here. Why make him suffer? He can't even stand. No, of course not. But a doctor could visit? They said he should be hospitalised. No one will come to Ostrov. I called around yesterday. Oh, my dear. He was so full of life. That's enough! Damn it, I keep telling you not to drink! You said you found me in the trash! That's enough. Yeah, it's enough. At least I behave myself. Unlike you. I have to watch you drink. You walk around drunk and embarrass me. Did you hear me? I had a drink or two. It helps me to calm down. It makes me feel more at peace. Valera always says to stop drinking. But I can't stop. Otherwise, I just despair... It wasn't always like this, life passed me by. I just want my kids to... Nothing good ever happened to me. Honestly... I just carry on out of habit, frankly. That's how it is. But I also can't live without him. I can't do without him. I can't explain it. I'd like to go to the city, if we had a home. I'd probably go there. But for now this is my paradise. Where are you, my love? Do they ever stop? I don't think so. No matter how long you watch them, they just march and march. Interesting stuff, isn't it? They devour everything. And there are more every single year. Today everyone lives for today. People just grab what they can. That's the way. Everyone grabs while they can. They don't think about the future. There's this weird system. There's money going around. There's money for the region in Putin's budget. But it's no use. Three local vice-ministers have already been jailed. 400 million rubles were allocated to the region. The new minister has not even been confirmed and he has already stolen this money. How is that even possible? Don't you know who you've appointed? That's how this system works. Even before he took office... Boom! 400 million already gone. And the guy is already in jail. He'll stay 2-3 years and be freed. With that money, you think he'd stay in jail? It's all linked to the local authorities. They know exactly what's going on. Who we are, how many. They're aware of it all, but they do nothing about it. They have such powerful equipment. They could catch us like that, in no time. But if they do, who will they go after later? That's the trick. We are like hares. When the king went hunting they used to release hares in the woods. That's us! They catch us and let us go, and catch us again. If they would just leave us be... We could slowly start making a living. Since the government can't do anything... Actually, they do something, but only for their own. Who are we to them? We're misfits! It's not wobbly, right? OK, you do it. That's the signal, the lines are open for the Direct Line with Vladimir Putin. As we prepare for the Direct Line, we see where people's main concerns lie. Presently: living standards, incomes, health. But what else do we see? Production is growing, inflation is down. Based on the latest data, it's below 5%. And incomes are recovering. Overall, it's what we hoped for, it's all going according to plan. Let's see who's calling. Here's a viewer from the city of Kursk. And here’s another call from a village. They have no water supply. It seems unthinkable in the 21st century! Let's hear what they have to say. Good afternoon, Vladimir Vladimirovich! Construction on our village began 20 years ago, but we still have no water supply. We have plenty of water. We should build a pipeline from here. We asked many times, but nothing happens. Just put us to work! Let's hear what your governor has to say. Good afternoon, Vladimir Vladimirovich! All residents can apply and we will connect them to the mains. So consider this an application on their behalf. I applied for them! Does that work for you? As fast as you can? Absolutely. Will do. - Why must the President discuss such minor matters? The concerns of ordinary people are not minor to me. Right, I'll take the boat out. Go ahead, good luck. Dear Vladimir Vladimirovich, Do you ever feel ashamed? If so why? Of course, like any human being, I hope. In the early 2000s, I travelled the country, which was then in very bad shape. We arrived in one region around dusk. It was autumn, the light had faded. I was wading through mud to the car... when an elderly woman approached me, muttered something and fell to her knees. She handed me a note. I took it and gave it to my assistants. And they... lost it. I'll never forget this story. I still feel ashamed. Since then, anything I receive myself I try to handle right away. That's it! We need to go straight to him. Then something will happen. Putin is what holds the country together. He got the country back on its feet. Who else if not him? He repaid debts, restored some order. He sorted the army out. And now he'll take care of the people. If someone else takes over now he will start to look after his own interests. That's always the way. Everything will fall apart again. Well, that's it. When I moved to Makhachkala, I got a job. I worked in a sushi bar rolling sushi. I took an apartment, got a car, married. We didn't always have enough money. It was pretty hard. This life destroyed my relationship with Tamangiz... I wanted to move back to Ostrov. Because it's hard to live there. Let me open it. Stop showing off, it won't open. So, any results? Give it back. I'll do it. Before next week? Otherwise there'll be no dinner. Go away! Let me try. No farewell dinner for my beloved son. I don't want him to go anyway. What was that? I don't want him to go to the army. We'll remember this day our whole lives. First the goat ran away, then we couldn't open a jar of peas. Hooray! It's a miracle! I did it! My God, how happy that jar makes you. I scratched up my fingers. It took us 15 minutes to open a jar! Yeah, the army ... You have to fall in line morning and evening. Maybe you can get into the tank force. I heard they make good money. Every place is different. Look at your cousin, he should have been fine in Moscow! But no, they were beaten like dogs. He made no secret of it. His commander would get drunk. and beat up everyone, one after the other. He probably had a fight with his wife and took it out on the soldiers. It all depends where you're posted. I served in the army myself. It was okay. In two years... I didn't have a single fight. As my mother saw me off all my relatives came to celebrate. OK, here we go. Who's next? Grandma? No, I don't have a scarf. You forgot all our traditions? I guess we did. The main thing is that you do well. It's good to go to the army. It's the only chance for young Russians to get something from the state right now. Quickly, put this on! Quickly! Stop it, Ma! Comedy Club! Quick march! Just don't disappoint your mother. Never mind Dad, think about Mum. It will be hard wherever you go, of course. It's been always hard in the army. Now he won't want to go. Why not? He has to go. Actually, the further away, the better. Let's drink for his luck. Listen, she wants to tell you something. Say something touching. Just stay healthy. Should I get off the boat? Come on, bro! We'll be in touch! How did we start? Dear Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin! I have a request... A request to do what? To make a request. Period. Yes, I put a full stop. Here on the island there used to be a fish farm, a kindergarten, a hospital. I was born in this hospital. There was a military base where they did flight tests. In a word, Ostrov was booming. I've got all that. Ostrov was booming. Then in the 90s it all started falling apart. It's been 25 years, and we live in ruins, without electricity. Even worse, we have no work. All my ancestors were fishermen. I am a fisherman, too. We've no choice but to poach the seas. There's nothing else and nowhere to go. We live here to survive. Dear Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin, I believe only in you. That's why I'm writing to you. Please help us! Happy New Year! May the New Year bring us many gifts. Many wonders, many... I don't even know what else. May it bring us luck. May it bring us more friends. We have friends for God's sake. We don't have a lot of friends. We could do with some more who don't fight all the time like you. 15 minutes to go! Now! Be quiet. 2020 has arrived. The third decade of the 21st century. We live in dynamic, turbulent, ambivalent times. Our own plans and dreams are those of Russia. What happened to your letter to Putin? No one called me, no one contacted me. I don't know what to think. Maybe my letter never left the island. We write but they never arrive. Someone is probably intercepting them. Someone is blocking these letters. We keep waiting, but there is no reply. Perhaps I have to write another one like my nephews said. You need to write one more! One letter won't do it. Then may be something will happen. Maybe then Putin will say: Aha! And if the second doesn't get there then I'll write a third! Only together we will be able to solve the problems facing our society and our country. United, we can achieve even the highest goal. Friends, the New Year is almost here. Let's wish each other and our homeland peace, well-being and prosperity. Happy New Year 2020! Hurrah! Happy New Year! Happy New Year! Hooray! Today, major changes take effect nationwide. The monthly minimum wage increased to 12,130 roubles ($200). ...the launch of the new hypersonic weapon attended in person by Vladimir Putin. We must bolster our country's position as a leading maritime power. Viewers were impressed by Putin's speech... ...an event of historical importance. The biggest constitutional changes in a century... ...introduced to the State Duma by Putin himself. The amendments will ensure Russia's future as a country of guaranteed civil and social rights. A solid, resilient state and absolute stability, guaranteeing our nation's independence and sovereignty. It will provide us with a dynamic system with the capacity to adapt to a changing world, and especially to changes within our country.
