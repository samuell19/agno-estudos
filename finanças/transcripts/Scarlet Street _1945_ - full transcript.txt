What annoyance, I will catch the next one. You veto to the meter, Chris. I don't care to wait, I sit down a little alone. He/she Hears, Charlie. You believe that J.J. does he/she have a mess with that girl? It is what seems. I wonder how it will be. - What, Chris? Because to feel that he/she loves you a treasure like that. To me they have never looked this way at me, not even of young. Yes, we are usually sleepy that they are not completed... ...although we continue dreaming. I remember that of young he/she wanted to be painting. And he/she dreamt with which one day I would transform into a great artist. And you already see, I am a simple cashier. Still spots? - Yes, on Sundays. It is a way of killing the time. On Sunday is the only day that I don't like. Not I know what devils to make.

Is it wounded? I will warn to the police. - No, wait, wait. Agent! Agent! For where has he/she gone? - Over there. What aspect did he/she have? - I don't know it. Not I could see him/her the face. - He/she stole me 15 dollars. He/she didn't believe me when I said that he/she didn't have more and it hit me. For luck this gentleman he/she went in my defense. It is this way, it was there same. Not I could retain him/her, he/she got up and he/she began to run. Wait here. Please, largu?monos. We have to wait to the agent. Not I want to see my name in the newspapers, and you? The newspapers? - Clear. We would have that to present an accusation. When they arrest somebody, they will call him/her... ...week after week, it is a can. Does it accompany me to house? - Because me... Yes, clear, clear, if he/she believes it necessary. We go there. Well, this it is my house. I sit down not to be able to invite him/her to ascend. I share the apartment with another girl, Millie. Good night and thank you again. How's it going...? How's it going if we take a coffee? Of agreement. Hello, Kitty. - Hello, Tiny. This is the gentleman... - Cross. Charmed, Mister Cross. - A lot of pleasure, Tiny. Have you seen Johnny? No, since he/she left he/she makes a while. Two coffees, please. - I have changed opinion. I will take a glass, a rum Collins. Only one? - Yes, yes. Please, cheer up, man. He/she will see, it is that I have spent a little with the champagne. Does he/she want champagne? I will take the same thing that her. From the moment in that I saw it let us wonder which their name would be. Kitty. - In fact... ...he/she is Katherine, Katherine March. My friends call me Kitty. How do they call him/her their friends? Chris. Chris Cross. Chris Cross. Yes, they usually wear out jokes with that, but... ...I don't care it. Why does he/she look this way at me? Do I have the dirty face? It is beautiful. Yes, clear. What aspect I have. Thank you. Health, Chris. Miss March. Kitty. Yes, young lady. Good... Kitty... In short... He/she Will See, Kitty... ...the certain thing is that he/she could be their father. Not it is so old. Do you believe? Neither he/she is a boy, he/she is a man... ...mature. I like mature men. Well, what he meant it is that... ...he/she should not go alone down the street at these hours. It returned home of the work. Does he/she work until so late? To what is he/she devoted? Guess it. You are an actress. - How clever it is. Now that he/she knows everything on of me, speak to me of you... ...where does he/she work? - Me? Because he/she will see... - No, don't tell it to me. In a bank? - No. We will see, in Greenwich Village is artists. I knew him/her in Greenwich Village. Are you an artist, not? Well... Yes. Yes, I am painting. - It was clear, a painter. I love painting. To think that I took it for a cashier. Good... He/she knows the galleries of the Fifth Avenue? They have some prices. A very small square it cost but of 50.000 dollars. It was of... Sesan. - Cezanne. A French great painter. I would love it to have that square. Ah, yes? For that heap of dollars? Good, it cannot put on price to works teachers like that. They are worth... In short, what one can pay for them. For sure I saw his square and I eat he/she didn't know him/her... Next time I will look for their name. No, no, not. I don't usually sell my squares, Kitty. He/she doesn't sell them in New York. Good, me... - I already know it. For sure he/she sells their squares in Europe, in Paris or something like that. I admit that I don't know anything of painting. Comely to that pay him/her so much for their squares in France... ...as to the French here in New York. Nobody is prophet in their earth. Good, it is a point of view. In fact, when I paint I never think of the money. To put on makeup has a good time. - Does he/she have a good time him/her? Yes, seriously, painting it is as more I have a good time. God willing he/she had more time to make it. Is it that he/she doesn't have it? - No, good... He/she will see, me... my... In short... ...the businesses they occupy me a lot of time.

You know that still I have not gone to bed. Ah, not? Not I am so old as he/she thought, hey Charlie? No. He/she hears, now I have that to scrub the plates. Don't you care it, Charlie? - No, no, ahead. Has this painted it you? No, please, it is not a square, it is an insult. It is taken out of a picture. - Who is? He/she is the deceased of my... Your wife's first husband. The sergeant detective Higgins, Homer Higgins. Chris, is that medal authentic? Yes, they gave it to Adele. To your wife? - Yes. When he drowned in East River. It was terrible. Not they found their cadaver. What it punishes. Yes, a pain. Thank You, Charlie. - Of anything. How long do you take married? Five years. You will see... Adele didn't want to spend the money of the insurance... ...so he/she rented a room. Four dollars a week. And I was about saving money to buy paintings... ...and it interested me. She was very kind. Then I was well. And... You already know as they are these things. Do you want one? Well... ...it will be better than not. Where are your squares? They are there out in the lobby. Do you want to see those that I made? - Yes, yes indeed. Where you found a flower like that? You mean that you see this when you look at that? Because yes, yes. It is simply imagination question. You will see, when I look at that flower I sit down something as... Not even I can enter in my bathroom. He/she Forgives, Adele. It will be better than we leave. You can already enter. Why the day you spend in the sofa, lazy? They come here. Is all that you can make? Not you do think of another thing, hey? In what you want him to think, if not? If he/she wants more heating here, young lady... ...he/she will have to call to the porter. - Not be joker. Not you do have anything to tell me? Not I want to speak of Saturday at night. I don't refer a Saturday at night, I speak to you of this. It seems the note of a student that he/she wants to tie. You are perverting a minor. At what do you laugh? - Of you. It is so old that he/she could be my father. It is the type that he/she went in my help on Saturday for the night, my hero. Don't tell me. Do you see it? You were too much drunkard to remember it. Of not having deceived the agent he/she would have caught. So the type that defended you. Is it painting? And rich, very famous, besides charming. I would not shake as you. He/she had the opportunity of winning a departure. He/she only needed 50 dollars... ...and you what you brought me? 15 dollars. It is all that he/she had. Also, you had me waiting two hours under the rain. You looked at me in a bad way. - I didn't look at you in a bad way. He/she hears, any girl that he/she waits to a type two hours... ...under the rain he/she looks at it in a bad way. Do you know which your problem is? That you don't have imagination. What do you want him to make? - I want you to use the head. Not you understand that that type is coladito for you? It is our opportunity. Does it make a lot of money, not? According to you 50.000 turkeys for square, anything less. While I break the head to gather some capital... ...to you you are presented this. Not you have why to call to that other bird... ...for 50 dollars of shit. The old one is crazy for you. Write him/her, propose him/her an appointment. I would be unable to take out him/her money to that poor man. He/she hears, he/she also thinks of me. It uses your intelligence, I know to types riqu?simos... ...and with half of intelligence of the one that I have me... ...but, as what does it serve the brain? To make money it is necessary to have money, capital. The colleagues of the shop of cars... ...they would accept me as partner if takes the pasta. How much money do they want? - Three or four thousand. Caray! Nobody gives you anything. I already know that it is a lot of money, it uses the imagination. As soon as you enter in a business as that... ...then it is easy to get rid of the partners. And then you make yourself the master. Johnny, you have a lot of fantasy. And of the what a pasta? Can maybe get 50 or 100 dollars... ...but never a sum as that, he/she would not know how. Johnny! Johnny, where do you go? - Not I can lose the time. Johnny, Johnny... Not I know why I am so laundry for you. Yes, undoubtedly you know it. What do you say of my proposal? We go, you won't have to pluck it. Not at the beginning. You should get a decent apartment. A place to which he/she feels like go to to see you, don't unite pigpen like this. What do you say, lazy? Can I enter in my house? - Hello, ugly face. Why you don't settle here, Johnny? I will charge this way you the rent. - Please, Millie. He/she stops to enter with my fianc?. - How is that word written? It is written with "F" of ugly. Does Kitty pay the half, not? That is what we agree when signing the contract. For me you can stay with the apartment. I last with him. What has he/she meant? - Anything, you already know Johnny. Yes, I know him/her too much. He/she has already bought you the ring of commitment? That seems to worry more than to me. A model of 45 turkeys. Roger left it to me in 18 and above it still won. Not you were modeling strips for the catalog? It is this way. I have eaten too much. If they return the corsets, I swear to stop to be model. Why don't you want to work? With that figure. If was not so lazy. Who you believe that you are, my guardian angel? What he/she goes, rich, I lost the wings a long time ago. It is evident. It doesn't miss me that says goodbye to you. Not you arrived on time to the work... ...since you knew Johnny. Treasure, what has he/she spent? What you would want that passes you. I am in love, crazily in love. Of somebody that mistreats you as to a load animal. Don't enter with Johnny. You could choose the man that wants. Clear, and it is him to the one that I want. He/she will make of you a lost one. Not you would get love although gives you in the face. If it is there where he/she gave you, you should know it. I would like to sing as that sparrow. There up there are two, they are building a nest. Where have you learned that? I learned it being boy. He/she already makes almost 40 years that he/she didn't whistle. Today I sit down as a boy. You have sold some square lately? No. Why you don't paint me a portrait? I would like it. I can take the easel to your apartment? Not I believe that to my friend he likes. How long does it take you to paint a square? Sometimes one day, sometimes one year. One cannot say, a square goes sprouting. It is that a square can it sprout? The feeling yes. That is the important thing, the feeling. And me, for example, good, to me nobody taught me to draw. I trace a line around of what I sit down when seeing the things. Yes, I understand. It is as... ...to fall in love, I suppose. You already know. You know somebody that he/she leaves making important... ...until you cannot happen without him. Interesting. I believe that the art is this way. Each square can be a history of love. He/she had never heard speak to anybody in that way. Good... ...neither there are a lot of people to the one that can be spoken this way. One is quiet it. He/she keeps it inside as a secret. Yes, exact. That is in fact what passes me. I have to be quiet many things. The certain thing is that I am in a mess. You, Kitty? - Have not you noticed it? I am without a cent. This dress Millie lent it to me, and I owe him/her the rent. Tell me how much it is. - Forget it. Not I should mention it. I bothered you the day. - Kitty, me... I will already get ready them. Not it could accept anything of you, Chris. No, if... - No, no, it would not rot. I never requested money to a man and I won't make it now. Not I want to ruin our friendship. Kitty, please. Not it could return it to you. Chris! Maybe yes it can return it. If you pay the rent of a study... ...he/she would have where to live and you could you paint, do you understand it? You could paint my portrait. What does it happen? Not you do want to paint my portrait? I have to tell you something. - What? I have deceived you. I lied you. I am a married man, Kitty. And why didn't you tell it to me? Not I am of the class of women that they go out with married men. You remember that Preposition of knowing somebody... ...of how it begins to like you... ...until you only think of him? You should say me that you had a wife. Not I am in love with her. - But you married. It felt very alone, it could not support the solitude. Poor Chris. Not you are mad with me? He should be, however, he am not. With you not, Chris. I will let you to help me. How much do you need? - 500 dollars. 500... I need 500 dollars. It could return 10 every week. It is well, Mister Cross. Although a guarantee will need. No, thank you. - Somebody solvent? Do pay? - Pure formulismo. Thank you. - At your disposal. And that tight of Hogarth... ...why it cannot go up you the salary? You not even win it enough to buy me a radio. I have to go all the below nights to listen the serial one. I don't make more than to save... ...and you wear out it in paintings and canvases. Not I know what you will make without me. My dear Homer. If has a tomb where to take you flowers. You were not even capable of declaring you. I had to put on the words in the mouth. God willing follows widow. I support you because we are married. You have me full. - Yes, I am also full. Have you been drinking? No, neither a swig. It lets him to smell you the encouragement. Then, what does he/she spend? Why are you speaking this way to me? Always censoring that he/she doesn't buy you a radio. You believe that I like to lower all the nights to listen the radio? You buy it, you have money. - The money of their insurance? I don't want a radio, but you. I will never play those funds, I keep them for my age. Homer would have bought me a radio. He/she had a good salary and it provided me a house. You continue in the same one apartment, not? Yes, but then he/she didn't smell of painting. Not I hit eye with that damned scent. Not I want to see the lobby full with squares. If you don't come undone of them... ...I assure you that I will give them to him to a chamarilero. Adele... - Yes. I swear you that I will make it. For the things that you paint. Already bad eras when you copied post cards. Uti? copied post cards and he/she is considered a great painter. Already, I suppose that you are copying to Utri? or like he/she calls himself that. Every time you are crazier, yes. Not there is more than to see that makes. Strange Flores, snakes... You only lack to paint to a naked woman. I have never seen to a naked woman. It would lack more, that waits. Date hurry. The Hour of the Happy Home it will already begin, lover. Under at once, Dora, Sr. Cross has arrived late. He/she comes. When you end up, he/she washes the plates. Christopher. Christopher. What are you making? It was... It was looking for the newspaper. Are you blind? What does it happen? Not you had gone down to hear the radio? It was ruined exactly in the best thing, that apparatus is a junk. Have you read this news? - Which? A murder in Queens. A man killed his wife with a paperweight... ...it put their body in a trunk and he/she sent it to California. Here he/she says that he/she had... - I have read the newspaper, thank you. He/she won't get rid of the punishment. He/she will go to the electric seat, you will already see it. Yes, with the inspectors of New York didn't have escape. Why you don't leave the newspaper and do you wash the plates? Adele... ...you would not speak seriously when you said... ...that you would give him/her my squares to a chamarilero? Of course. Because you won't have to make it. My friend he/she plans to rent a study... ...in Greenwich Village, I will take them there. Good, if he/she is the enough idiot as to allow it... ...ahead. - Woman! It is the last floor, he/she has a lot of light and it is cheap. They have heard speak of Tony Riverside the designer? He/she rented the apartment during three years. Not he/she could work in another place. Do they come? This was their study. These drawings they belong to Tony Riverside. He/she used to make that with their models... ...when he/she worked in some cover. Today they would pay a fortune for them. Is artist, young lady March? Where is the bedroom? - Here. How much the rent is, Mister Johnson? 150. Tony Riverside left some things in the basement. Van with the apartment if they want to use them. Here the bedroom is. I don't like anything the paper. Will they paper it? Good, if he/she rents it one year. The paper will choose it me. He/she stops to poke in the handbag. Hello, lazy. He/she has looked like each other to hear the bell. Because I have not heard anything. Is this all that you have? With what you spent last night, you are lucky that it is that. Until you bought me a book. According to you, do you want to be an actress, not? To interpret to William Shakespeare. It is as much as I have left. You will know how to get more, hey, lazy? He/she said that he/she made a lot that he/she didn't sell squares. And he/she has paid me all this. He/she Looks, Kitty. I need at least1.000 dollars. To that you have already softened it, no? Now press him/her. It seems uncomfortable when I speak to him/her of money. Beautiful, you have it about to candy. It is already hooked, it cannot come unfastened. Could he/she leave me, not? - Not forget to their wife. Insinuate him/her that her it could find out everything... ...and you will already see like he/she reacts. That calls you blackmail. He/she could only call himself blackmail, small... ...if you allow to catch. Is he? - I told you that he/she had heard the bell. Damned it is, come undone of him. Go... Not you do answer to the bell? And you were not mad? - It is a truce. Whisky? - Thank you, treasure. He/she knew that you were, it is hardly twelve o'clock. I lowered again and I saw the open door. Go, go, go... Not it is bad for a small poor person. Not begin another time with that. Don't tell me that it is under the bed. No, lover. You can leave, Johnny. Not you had more than to call, ugly face. Have you guessed right in the careers? It could be. The last time that I saw you you spoke of leaving to Hollywood. It is possible that he/she still makes it. I read somewhere around that a type left to Hollywood without a cent... ...and it won a million, and callow. That yes, it was handsome, he/she worked in a supermarket. If he/she worked he/she didn't resemble you. Do you want to stop to discuss? - Not we are discussing. It is that Millie doesn't have neither he/she devises. They say that to the actors... ...they pay them five or ten thousand dollars per week... ...to make what? To be made the five pesetas, to shake the girls. Cannot I maybe make it me? If it is this way, why don't you make it? He/she can that he/she makes it, give me time. Chris! I have brought some of my things, Kitty. Tomorrow I will bring more. And the rest on Saturday. You have company. - They Are Millie and Johnny. Johnny... - The boyfriend of Millie. I will present them to you. Millie, this he/she is a friend, Chris Cross, Millie Ray. How is it, young lady Ray? - Charmed, Mister Cross. And Johnny Prince. - Charmed, Mister Cross. How is it? We have not seen each other in some part? It could be, it could be, Mister Cross. Yes. And I am not able to remember it, perhaps make a mistake. Perhaps. Good, I already leave, Kitty. - I will accompany you, ugly face. Don't bother you, Johnny. Not you will think that I will allow you to go alone? It could run over you a tram. Good-bye, Mister Cross, it was a pleasure. Thank you for the whisky, Millie. - Of anything, good-bye. Until soon, Kitty. - Until soon, Johnny. Does it happen you something, Chris? The truth, your friend Johnny it has just liked me. Johnny is a good type. Yes, clear, otherwise he/she would not be your friend. There is something in him that... - Millie is crazy for him. You would like to toss a glance to my squares? Still not. They come to sit down. Are you happy? For the first time in my life. - Very happy? I think all the time of you. I am always wanting to see you, to have you close. I know that I am not entitled to wonder it... ...however, at some time there are...? Without a doubt, there were other men in your life. Only one, Chris. Do you still see him/her? I have forgotten him/her. He/she looks, Kitty, if was single... ...and if he/she didn't have a wife... - But you have it. Yes, I already know it, but if her... Good, if happens something that liberates me... ...would you marry me? Now don't speak of that, lover. The most urgent thing it is that it gets an employment. This life is expensive. Not he/she wanted to request you he/she swims... ...because I know that you have not sold any square lately. Not you do have enough money? Not you know the difficult thing that it is to find work as actress. The talent doesn't count for anything, recommendation is needed. You should know to some fat fish... ...that an agent takes you and that hill money. It is needed clothes and those things. - Kitty, you are beautiful. Chris, the beauty is not everything, treasure. It is the clothes, perfumes, the impression that you cause. He/she would need a thousand dollars only for dresses. A thousand dollars? - As a little. Perhaps he/she requests them to Millie or to their boyfriend Johnny. ?I has a lot of money. No, no, no, Kitty. To Johnny no way. Why not? I will get you the money as it is. Treasure, you are adorable. I begin to believe that you are in love with me. He am, Kitty, and a lot. Chris, you are very impetuous. I know that you like, but there are certain limits. Yes, I know it. I have to leave, I have that... I will return at noon tomorrow, Kitty. I will be waiting for you. I set that you have to leave. Good-bye, Chris. Not forget the money. - I will get it. Good-bye, my life. - Good-bye. I don't understand it. That unhappy one should be crazy. A snake in the high one. Somebody exists able to pay for this reason? He/she hears, you are sure that a humbug is not? It is too silly to be a humbug. In that you are right. - How would it get the money? If has to be won it, not him they would give more than 50 a week. Not you have neither art idea. Maybe not, but that believes that he/she has arrangement. This it doesn't displease me. Have you seen flowers like this? I wonder if he/she could sell these squares. And what I tell him/her when do let us wonder where they are? Tell him/her that they are in a guardamuebles. You have to protect them. Not you can leave some squares of value... ...where anyone it could be taken them. It is chancy, any expert would recognize them. Today he/she has tried to kiss me and I have not liked that. They have already kissed you other times. He/she hears, they are not even signed. That what it cares, they are known. Not where I will take them. Johnny, I don't support that he/she plays me nobody more than you. It disturbs me that I looks at myself in that way. If was cruel or vicious or if screams me, it would be different. You don't love me. If you loved me you would understand me. No? - No. And now, what? Good, maybe yes. Making overtimes, Mister Cross? I am about to leave, Ben, I already leave alone you. You don't bother. I have caught him/her exactly on time. Change me this check, does he/she want, Chris? It is personal. Yes, yes, of course, J.J. Here he/she has. - Thank You, Chris. Good night. - Good night. Hello, Nick. - Hello. What do you bring there? To the one that paints these squares they give him/her 50.000 turkeys for each one. What is it what spends, Nick? From where you took out them, of Washington Square? The hippies of Village they sell these messes... ...for the price of the cloth. This didn't paint it any hippie of Village. That is my house of zeals, no? And that snake he/she comes directly from Bronx. That type lives in Brooklyn, it is famous. Yes, how does he/she call himself? - Well... He/she hears, I have brought you other things and you have never requested me names. They were jewels, he/she brings another gender and we will continue making businesses. Take you this to Washington Square where you found it. I see that he/she has good eye for the art. It is one of my best squares. And this, how's it going? Not he/she knew that was you painter. I am not it. Are they good? - Well... ...they have something. A characteristic... ...peculiar, the perspective. Is it important? - Yes indeed that yes. Look at my squares. Where did he/she buy them? I didn't buy them, I want to sell them. He/she wants that you the bandage for a commission. How much does he/she believe that they are worth? - I begin requesting 25. Then, he/she already knows, to sell squares is bad business. Nowadays people don't buy art. Not there is sensibility, neither good pleasure, neither proportion. Neither perspective. Leave me their name and their address. I will return later, good-bye. Hello, Johnny. - Hello, Tiny. Who has given you that? Nick. And what is there of my ring? Do you know what costs a brilliant one? - I gave you 900 dollars. Do you want to lower the voice? You have told me that that old one is silly. He/she can that you are it you. He/she said that those squares they were worth a lot of pasta. Did you bother yourself in checking it? - What does it happen? They are only worth 25 dollars each one, that it is their price. You have become crazy. Don't provoke me, small. - Don't get angry. Then you don't call me crazy. That old one is a humbug. Does he/she have money, not? And if he/she requests it borrowed or are their savings? Perhaps he/she steals it. - To steal it? What do you say? Not it is their style. He/she would never dare to steal. Because it doesn't win it with their squares. Maybe be silly, but he/she knows about art. The day of the museum he/she explained to me many things. It is very clever, people stopped. What museum? - Metropolitan. Caray, there is squares that they are worth millions. Where do you go? I will make you be in ridiculous, lazy. Not you can take their squares to the museum. Who does that say? Does he/she know who has bought them? Janeway, Damon Janeway. Not he/she does know who Sr is. Janeway? - No. An art critic. The biggest authority in modern art of New York. He/she saw them and he/she bought them both. He/she not even noticed mine. Neither to look at them. He/she wants to put on in contact with you. He/she told me that calls him/her, you wait a moment. No... Forgive. Tell me, what does he/she make you so much grace? You, treasure. You are the clever one that went to leave me in ridiculous. To make fun of me. You have sold two squares for 10 cents each one... ...and now you cannot get paid. - He/she shuts up. My God. - What does it happen now? How will I say it to Chris? - He/she won't find out. For sure if that Janeway he/she is a critic... ...he/she writes in a newspaper. We will enter in a mess, I told you that doesn't make it. Don't become nervous. The type to which I sold them to him he/she doesn't know me of anything. Give me a glass, I need it. Chris? - No, he has key. He/she walks, see to see who is, date hurry. You forgive... ...we are looking for a man, I don't know how he/she calls himself. Then I cannot help him/her. Apologize. Look. And this. It belongs to him. There it is. Why it disappeared in that way? Take, 50 less dollars 20%. Hear, I don't know of what he/she speaks to me. Of the square that you left me. It will be better than we show up, my name is Janeway. This is Mr. Dellarowe. - Charmed. What is what you/they want? We would like to know who painted those squares. Doesn't he/she know it? - Undoubtedly not. For that reason we have come. Please, if he/she is the painter's friend... ...put him/her in contact with Dellarowe. Why he/she bought them if he/she doesn't know who has painted them? Because they are good. - Who did paint them? No, Johnny, not. Not be so modest, dear March. Do they come it? They have made me be bad. He/she made me promise that he/she would not say it. For that reason I faked not to know it. It is very special regarding their squares. Not it lets him to see them nobody, they already come that not even the signature. That has observed. It is you a great artist, young lady March. Oh, not. - Do they come it? Neither he likes that it is spoken of it. It is convinced that their squares are not worth anything. For that reason it takes to you those two... ...to give him/her trust, he/she knew that they were very good. Does it allow me the money? He/she would never have guessed that he/she was a woman. Neither me. Their work is very vigorous, young lady March. Can we see some more? - Clear, ahead. See as much as they want. - Thank you. You are crazy. How do you dare to make this? What fright. I believed that they were policemen. I know that I make, those neither they find out. Not I will be able to deceive the critic. You have always wanted to be an actress, it is your opportunity. Many hours you have happened with the old one, you already know like speech. Janeway will swallow it to him, I will tell him/her that he/she comes to speak with you. No, he/she waits. How long does it take painting? Since he/she was a girl, Mister Janeway. Did he/she go to some school? - No, he/she was born with talent. I believe that I am the only one that it has encouraged it... ...so that it continues ahead. As friend, unselfishly. Non memory their name. - Prince. Mr. Janeway, she is upset. Perhaps if you speak to him/her. I will attempt it. Well, Mister Dellarowe. He/she knows if Ms. March would he/she leave me the squares? Good, that depends. What would you give to change? The prices will go in increase, however... In general, I can say if a square... ...it has been colored for a man or for a woman... ...and you have deceived me, young lady March. It is not only original, he/she has virile force. How long does it use in a square? Sometimes one day and sometimes one year. One cannot say, a square sprouts. It is a feeling, he/she already knows. A feeling that sprouts, as... As falling in love, I suppose. A good description. In my opinion, each square if it is good it is... ...a history of love. Can I write that? - No, please. Non scribe on me. I fear myself that it will be a very difficult case. Why he/she doesn't have trust in their work? Because I don't know how to draw. He/she doesn't make it bad. I trace a line around what I sit down... ...when I look at the things. To speak with you it is something that comforts me. What? How does that go? We have already broken the ice. Kitty, Mr. Dellarowe... ...he/she wants to have the sole right of does all your work, find you well? As friend I advise you that you accept. They can come tomorrow to the gallery? To what time? - To the one that the young lady wants. What do twelve o'clock find it? Later go to eat lunch. Good, me... Not I know... There it will be. Their presence has been decisive, Mister Prince, to encourage her. I see that it is tired, young lady March. It is enough per today. We leave, until tomorrow. Thank you, Mister Janeway, good-bye. Good night. Good night, Sr. Dellarowe. - Good night. Good-bye. - Good-bye. He/she listens, lazy. Not I know what you have told him/her to Janeway... ...but you have it in the pocket. He/she won't finish with the lunch. Good, and what difference does it make? - If you refer to... Not continue behaving as a girl. Allow it to talk of what wants, he/she will speak to you of art. If I was sensible I would leave your side. But you are not it. Here below, as if signs a letter. He/she comes. Katherine March. - Kitty? There that is, hide it. Kitty? Chris! - Kitty, happened here and... Hello, Mister Cross, I have gone up a moment. I Thought that Millie it would be at home. He doesn't care him to admire their squares, not? No, no, at all, Mister Prince. Excellent work, it is a magnificent square. He/she has very good perspective, hey? Yes, it is what I am given better, the perspective. In short, I already have to leave. Until soon, Mister Cross. If you see Millie tell him/her that I am in the bar of Tiny. Don't bother you, I know the road. Does it take a lot of time here? No, why? I don't like it. - Not he/she is bad person, Chris. Not I know why reason you don't like it. Do tell me, was he? Him, who? You said that there was a man. For heaven's sake, when will you forget that? Was he? - No! Kitty... - He/she paints if you want. Not I plan to stay here so that you torment me. Kitty... Kitty, please. Leave alone me, I will have dinner outside! Kitty, don't get angry. For that come if always are we discussing? I didn't request it to you. - I beg it to you. Sacred sky. Start to paint. - Not I can. Not I can paint when you are mad with me. Do you want me to leave? I want you to stay here painting. Chris, I sit down it. Why you torment me with something that belongs to the past? Because because... Do you want to marry me? - Not you would rot. Perhaps happen something. - As what? It offers that your wife don't hear you speak this way. I would marry you if was free, but you are not it. So don't speak of it. He/she walks, start to work. Do I paint your fingernails? Good, he/she planned to make it me alone. However... Yes, make it, Chris. It will be a work teacher. Hello, Adele. I went to the butcher shop as you took charge me. They have given me a liver buen?simo. From when you know to Katherine March? He/she answers. Not I know of what you speak to me. - From when do you know it? Not lose the calm, it lets him to help you with the coat. You have lost the calm. It separates that, it drops the knife. You want to behead me. From when do you know it? Not I know to what you refer. - Liar. You take years copying their work. Faking that you are the creator of those squares... ...while you copied the work of a great artist. For sure you go to Dellarowe to take notes. Where? - You know it very well. To the gallery Dellarowe in the 57. The window is full with squares of Katherine March. Have you become madwoman? A single square is worth 500 dollars, they are brilliant. Now I understand why he/she sometimes thought... ...that there was something in your work, I already know why. If I see you again painting here... ...I swear you that I will call to that woman... ...and I will tell him/her that you are plagiarizing their ideas. Humbug. Hogarth should go carefully, you are able to steal him/her. That not, affection. Dellarowe wants that you give them to him all. Chris finished it just yesterday. Janeway says that the last squares... ...they are the best. I was right about Janeway, lazy. Yes, but it puts me nervous. This week I have left three times to have dinner with him... ...and he/she already speaks of having breakfast. He/she looks at me in a strange way. You limit yourself to have him/her I please. For you it is very easy to say it... ...but, what do you tell me of my nerves? Dad will take charge of Kitty. It is possible that he/she gives him/her a ring of brilliant... ...a limousine... ...and a house with garden. - And to Johnny? ?I goes with the lot. Chris. As my squares they have arrived to Dellarowe? Chris! Don't get angry with me. Not I am mad, I don't understand anything. Not it is possible. Forgive me, treasure. Me... He/she needed money. He/she had to pay the furniture. It was so humiliating. Not he/she could tell it to you, you have been so generous with me. Not he/she could. For that reason I sold the squares. To Dellarowe? Seriously you did sell them to him? Yes. I already know that I should not sign them with my name... ...but Dellarowe demanded to know who had painted them... ...and he/she could not give him/her your name. He/she no longer has remedy, truth? No. The curious thing is that he/she didn't seem to give him/her importance. Yes, the certain thing is that yes he/she has it, Kitty. If the has taken me to somebody as Dellarowe... ...he/she would not have caught them. I am a failure. No, you are a great painter. Mr. Dellarowe said it and also Mr. Janeway. Good... ...they said that I was it. - Because they will continue saying it. Chris! - No, Kitty. Please, don't cry more. I am happy, it is as a dream. Chris, you are so good, so generous. Not it cares what name take the squares... ...yours or mine. It is as if is married. Only I take your name. Go, that makes that sit down in debt. I want to paint your portrait, what do you say? It ascends there. Do you know how I will call it? Self-portrait. EXHIBITION DE KATHERINE MARCH Hello, Damon. - Hello. Williams. I admit that it is the first time that I agree with you. Thank you. I believe that the painter is still more fascinating than their squares. How is it? As Gioconda without the smile, hidden something. It seems sometimes two different people. I speak of that in my article, do you want to read it? Mr. Cross, out is somebody that he/she wants to see him/her. Who is? - Not he/she mentioned their name. He/she only said that he/she was a detective. Are you the detective? - I was it once, Mister Cross. Is it that it doesn't recognize me? No. Homer. Surprised, hey? Don't faint, Mister Cross. Calm, let him to explain to him/her. For then it was put in a mess. It took out them money to the bars secret of the port. They gave the blow. And the poli will make an investigation. One night was in the bridge of Brooklyn... ...giving turns to the matter... ...when he/she appeared a type screaming: "A woman it has jumped of the bridge." I left running, I took off the jacket and I threw myself to the water. It felt so bad that he/she wanted not to leave. Does he care it? Good, I began to swim in full night... ...I caught it of the arm, to the while it was tired... ...I heard the whistle of a tug near me... ...I was tossed above a barge... ...I held myself to the overboard and I allowed myself to take. I looked my hand, and what was there in her? The woman's handbag. He/she had caught their handbag instead of their arm. Inside of there was 2.700 dollars in notes. He/she imagines to somebody that do take off the life with that money? And the barge discharged in a ship barn... ...going to Honduras, and I left with him. Then, if it is not dead... ...I am not married with Adele, certain is not? How much you would pay me for... ...to maintain the closed mouth... ...and to disappear? A moment. Legally you he/she is the husband of Adele. Without a doubt, you need Adele and I need money. Are you a cashier, not? He will find easy to be made with a couple of thousands. No, not, I could not make something like that. Not he/she does plan to return with her? - No. Although not to favor you. I will leave for the good of Adele. Not you believe that this finishes here. It is possible that some day it returns. Adele would leave him/her at once for a man as me. I will get him/her the money. That is more reasonable. Although he/she will have that to wait for me here. I won't have it until later of closing at six o'clock. I Will Wait, Cross. Hello, Johnny. Hello, Kitty. - Hello, Mike. Hello. Not do forget the champagne, hey? Beautiful car, Johnny. Does he/she run a lot, not? Any poli it could reach me. He/she hears, they are enough 25 cents for a cube of ice? Clear, Johnny. Do you lend me the punch? Not forget to return it. - Clear, clear. Thank you. Only 200. It is all that I could get. Not he/she believes that their wife is something worth more? He/she will see, I want him to get that that it corresponds him/her, Mister Higgins. What he/she tells me of the money of the insurance? The insurance? Two thousand in the event of death, of their death. Adele has charged them, are his, not? The guard in their room. Not it is well that me the cripple, Mister Higgins, but... ...if you take them to him, it will be very fair. And how, of what way? - It is very easy. Tonight she plans go to watch a movie. I allow him/her to enter, you catch the funds... ...and it is released. Why don't you catch them? Good, it is necessary that let us stay to the margin. He/she already knows Adele. And if he/she doesn't go to the cinema... ...and I show up, will he/she discover me, not? Yes, only... ...that won't happen. - Why? He/she will see, you will wait in front of the house at eleven o'clock. All well? Why I should remain silent, and this darkness? Mrs. Michaels. He/she remembers to Mrs. Michaels, not? Yes. - And the other neighbors. Where are the funds? There, in the last drawer of the dresser. Well, give me the lantern. Thieves! Police! Who are you? No, it cannot be. Johnny! Oh, Johnny! - Hello, lazy. I adore you, Johnny. What has that been? Is Chris? Johnny, era Chris? - You call it. Chris. Chris. He/she should shake. How he/she went that is that he/she would come tonight? I don't understand it. You never understand anything. - Why do you get angry? It serves me to think as what being with an idiot as you? I told you that is careful. - Clear, throw the blame. You asked me that stays and I wanted to leave. Johnny, why do you speak this way to me? It is the true, I am fed up with you. Johnny. It is the only language that you understand, we have finished. Mr., sympathize with of the sinners. The on the way to the wrong it is easy to continue. However, that road it ends up in the hell. Mr., sympathize with of me, sinful poor person. Sympathize with of us, Mr.. Millie, am I Kitty, and Johnny? I supposed that he/she would go to Tiny, was he/she drinking? Anything, a fight. This cannot live without me. The same as I cannot live without him. Did he/she say if he/she would come here? To give me a beating? Go, how he likes to show off of hard man. Not you should worry, he/she only speaks to speak. If is in love you would understand it. He/she remains silent, Johnny is inoffensive. It is this way the love, treasure. He/she has just entered and mo?a that takes go. Good-bye, lover. Hello, Johnny. We go, Johnny, I have heard you. You lied me, Kitty. Was he, truth? I have me the blame of being in love? No, you only believe he to be. Not you can want somebody as that Johnny. It is bad. Does he/she have you dominated, not? He/she wanted to kill him/her. And that is horrible. To what have you come here? To request you that we marry. - And your wife? I no longer have it, that ended up. - For heaven's sake... Their husband has returned, I am free. We go, don't cry, Kitty. I know what you feel, but forget it. We all make errors, it doesn't care what happened. I can already marry you. I want you to be my wife. We will leave both together very far from here. Where can forget to that man. Not cry, Kitty. Please, don't cry. Not I am crying, imbecile, I laugh. Kitty... You are an unhappy one, how can you be so silly? Kitty... I have wanted to laugh in your face since I met you. You are ugly and old. And I am fed up with you. Full, full, full! Kitty, I beg it to you. You to kill Johnny? I would like that attempts it. All the bones would break you, him yes he/she is a man. Do you seek me, you? Outside of here, it was! What will you make? Chris! Chris! Don't come closer, Chris. Chris! Hey, what do you make? Be careful, Johnny, you will kill somebody. Chris, ascend. A moment, please. Why did he/she make it, Chris? When he/she called me the police he/she could not believe it. They denounced him/her for telephone. - Yes, a certain Higgins. I consulted the books before calling him/her. Does he/she know how much it lacks? More than 1.200. - We will take it to us. While it presents the accusation, Sr. Hogarth. Wait, Morris. Not I can make it. - But Mister Hogarth... You have completed with their duty and I thank him/her for it. There there is a box of cigarettes, take you her. This well, Mister Hogarth, what you say. Was Chris, for a woman, not? I imagined it. Not I want that go to the jail, Chris... ...but it cannot continue working here. I have not made anything, I want... I want a lawyer. Where did they stop it? - In Rivers Sandline. He/she tried to escape in the girl's car. That car is mine. This is also yours. It takes your initials, the blood belongs to the girl. Here there are 140 dollars that you removed him/her of the handbag. They are mine. This ring belonged to her, it will be worth about 600 dollars. Small expert is made. I found difficult it 1.200. Here they are the rest of the jewels. Not they are worth a lot, but it took them to him all. And why not? She will no longer need them. I want a lawyer. I am a citizen, I am entitled my. This also belongs you, no? He/she has your prints dactilares. Clear, I picked up it of the floor. How he/she went that is that it was dead? He/she thought that it was only sleeping. She didn't paint all those squares. Old Cross is not so silly as it seems, he/she painted them the one. Yes, the accused he/she brought me two squares. He/she told me that he/she had painted them Ms. March. I consider myself an expert and there is not the smallest doubt... ...Kitty was an excellent one painter. When he/she rented the study... ...she told me that it was an artist, he accompanied her. I didn't like it then and I don't like it now. Yes, when he/she drank it was I force. At two o'clock, when he/she left the bar, he/she said that he/she would give him/her a beating. Then I told him/her: "Care, John, you will kill somebody." And it killed her with my punch. Then I heard him/her say: "Hello, John", and it hung. It was there, yes. What I don't understand it is that he/she says that he/she painted. I never saw it paint. That was characteristic. Not he/she left that the sees paint. I have compared their letter with the signature. Not there is any doubt. That if Cross paints? He/she only knew how to copy, he/she is a humbug. He/she stole me to my and their boss and to Katherine March. My wife, that is to say, my former wife is right. I don't know how to paint. My copies were so bad that I had to destroy them. Not they do realize? Lie! I will pluck him/her. Hello, Mister Cross. - Hello. Tom Crucker of Living Road. Yes, Tom Crucker. John Williams of Morning Road and Cohan of Hear. Hello. A cigarette? - No, thank you. Van to attend? Yes, I don't like it to witness executions... ...but I don't care this that it is made. He/she made him/her Easter to Johnny Prince... ...when he/she said that he/she didn't know how to paint. Nobody made him/her Easter to Johnny... ...except him to speak too much. Yes, when it began to insult to the girl it signed their sentence. I noticed the jury. If has been quiet it would have been life imprisonment. The tests were only incidental. To what does he/she refer? Was a fair trial, not? Yes, but always there is a doubt. I suppose that you will say that justice has not been made. That the true murderer it is safe. Me not, that is impossible. Mr. Cross, any crime it is unpunished. How does he/she say? - No, don't throw him/her of the language. Not he/she will stop of speaking, it is their favorite topic. It is well, you can laugh, boys. Anything is unpunished. Imagine that we have a tribunal right here... ...judge, jury and executioner. I don't understand him/her. The murder doesn't solve anything, what do you say? You have seen many trials. In that I should admit that you are right. The problem is right here and it cannot leave. Is it here, only here, and what? That you continue punishing you unceasingly. Not you can escape from it, never. That doesn't make sense. You have not seen so many trials as me, Mister Cross. I prefer the judge to dictate my it sentences before to make it me. At what time is the execution? At eleven o'clock. I didn't make it, I swear him/her that I didn't make it. Why don't they want to believe me? I have told the truth, I didn't kill her. I swear them that I didn't kill her, I wanted it, I wanted it... Kitty... No, Kitty, not. Coarse! No, Kitty, was him. You were innocent, you were pure, he killed that. For that reason you should die, I have killed you. I beg it to you. There this passing something. He/she calms down, friend, calms down. Up, we go, up. Ah, you are you. I have not told you that you don't sleep here? You already know the norms. Veto to the hospice, he/she walks. We go, we go. Who is that old one? He/she has the mania that it killed two people... ...five or six years ago. It is a fixed idea. It is always trying to surrender. He/she wants them to judge it and him execute, he/she is a crazy poor person. That is their work teacher. It hurts me to lose it. For 10.000 dollars it should not care him/her so much.
