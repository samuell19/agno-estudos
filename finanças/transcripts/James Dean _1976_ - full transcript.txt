NARRATOR: His name was James Byron Dean. He was an actor. He died in 1955 at the age of 24. He had starred in just three pictures, only one of which had been released prior to his death. Yet before he was in his grave, he was already a myth. What you're about to see is one man's recollection, an image of the actor as seen through the eyes of a friend. Like all memories, it is intensely personal, elusive, and incomplete, yet it refuses to die. [music playing] WILLY: I had another dream last night. PSYCHIATRIST: James Dean again? WILLY: Yes. I can't seem to shake it. PSYCHIATRIST: These things take time. WILLY: I don't think I'll ever get over this one. It was too real. PSYCHIATRIST: Why don't you tell me about it? WILLY: I can't remember exactly how it started, but somehow I got word that Jimmy wanted to see me. PSYCHIATRIST: Then in this dream he was still alive? WILLY: No. He was already dead and buried. PSYCHIATRIST: Go one. WILLY: I found myself at this place, like a sanitarium, where they had him locked up. Jimmy was sitting on the bed when I came in. He looked fine at first, I mean, just like himself. He even laughed, called me Willy. No one else ever called me Willy. Only there was something wrong. I could see it in his eyes. He kept saying I was the only one who could save him. PSYCHIATRIST: You? How? WILLY: He never got to tell me. Just then we heard a car outside. It was getting dark. They were coming to take him away, back to the grave. PSYCHIATRIST: They? WILLY: Two men, like hospital orderlies, and a nurse. They came in an ambulance, but they brought a coffin. His coffin. PSYCHIATRIST: What do you suppose all of that means? It was as if he was putting his fate in my hands, trusting in me. PSYCHIATRIST: How did you feel about that? I was terrified. PSYCHIATRIST: Of what? Of letting him down again. PSYCHIATRIST: Again? I meant just letting him down. PSYCHIATRIST: You said again. There must have been another incident. Do you recall any? Not off hand. PSYCHIATRIST: How badly do you want to get to the bottom of this? That's why I'm here. PSYCHIATRIST: Then you're going to have to take some risks. Like what? PSYCHIATRIST: Like taking a closer look at this relationship, confronting it. Are you willing to try? I think so. PSYCHIATRIST: Let's go back to the beginning, find out what happened. How did you first feel about him? Deaner? He was the last guy in the world I would have picked for a friend. As a matter of fact, I thought he was a joke when we first met. I was in college, back in 1950. [music playing] We were doing Shakespeare's "Macbeth". Jimmy was playing the part of Malcolm. There sure wasn't anything so special about him then, not that I could see anyway, at least not at first. Before we reckon with your several loves and make us even with you. My thanes and kinsmen, henceforth be earls, the first that ever Scotland in such an honor named. What's more to do as would be newly planted with the time. Hey, who's your hick playing Malcolm? Transfer student from Santa Monica City College. His name's James Dean. Oh yeah, Dean. I can't ever remember his name. Don't bother. I get a feeling that's one name you'll never see in lights. You aren't kidding. Would you two hush up? JAMES DEAN: By self and violent hands took off her life. This-- [WHISPERING]What needful else. And what need for else-- [WHISPERING]That call upon us. That calls upon us by the grace of grace. We shall perform in measure, time, and place. So thanks to all at once and to each one whom we invite to see us crowned at Scone. [music playing] [applause] You were really [inaudible] tonight. Well, it's true. Isn't it, Bill? [inaudible] Ah, Jim, excuse me. There's someone over here I'd like you to meet, OK? OK. [mumbling incoherently] Who's that female he's talking to? Looks like Claire Folger's assistant. WOMAN: Claire Folger? The motion picture agent. You mean she might be interested in him? WILLY: Will you look at him? Maybe he can't act, but he sure knows how to operate. Let's put this away. Hey Willy, where you been keeping yourself? Cramming for midterms. Listen, would you mind not calling me Willy? I really hate that. Whatever you say. Anything out there look good? Only this one? Oh, apartment on Comstock, huh? Probably too expensive though. What's the matter? Tired of fraternity life? Yeah, I guess it's not my speed. You're not supposed to do that. Why? You want somebody else to get there first? [church bells ringing] You're really something. You checking out of dorm? Yeah, I can't concentrate. It's like a barracks. Where you headed now? Up to Hollywood, a guy that says he can give me a job as an usher over at CBS. You mind if I bum a ride? I got to see some agent up there. So, you want me to represent you, hm? Uh huh. Why? Because you're good. Well, you certainly have all the right answers, don't you? Do you know what I expect from my clients? Hm. I've got a pretty good idea. Mm-hm. There's a TV commercial coming up. I'll let you know about it. Is that all for now, ma'am? For now. Did you really go through with it? I mean, even for a TV commercial? Who said anything about going through with it? Well, sooner or later, you're going to have to pay the piper. Yeah? You don't get something for nothing, not in this town anyway. Yeah, well, you let me worry about that. How did you make out over at CBS? WILLY: I start Monday. Doesn't pay much, but work is work. Got to start somewhere. Hey, maybe I could get you in too. You mean it, Willy? Oh. that would be fantastic, because I've got to start learning. I mean, really, really learning. You see, ever since I was a kid, well, I've always known I was going to be an actor. I mean, do you ever get the feeling that your destiny is not your own hands, like there's something you just got to do and you have no control over it? Well, that's how I feel about acting. You really think it's possible, huh? I mean, make it big. [laughter] Only thing stopping you is you. [honking] Huh. You know, Willy, you and me make a good team. Now we can learn from one another. How do you mean? Well, like, uh, like the other day when, when you were talking about Tchaikovsky-- Mm-hm. Shoot. I don't even know where that is. [laughter] Tchaikovsky's a who, not a where. He was a Russian composer. There, you see what I mean? Hey, why don't we share a place? Room together? Sure, why not? Hey, what-- what do you say we uh, take a look at this place on Comstock, huh? I don't know. See? There you go. What do you mean there I go? There I go what? [sighing] Putting up barriers. Listen up, let life happen. Take a chance. What do you got to lose? OK, OK. Why not? Only one condition. Mm? You've got to stop calling me Willy. Scouts honor. Some boy scout. Next you'll swear on your mother's grave. My mother's dead. My mother died when I was wee, maybe that's why I'm me. Sorry. I didn't know. I thought I heard you mention her like she was still alive. I didn't-- you know? That's my aunt Ortense. Ortense? Ortense. I call her Mom. She and my uncle Marcus raised me, back in Indiana. No offense, honest. Mm. You know, Willy, I got a feeling. If you and me stick together we're going to take this whole town. We're going to grab it by a tail and give it a spin. [music playing] WILLY [VOICEOVER]: Jim loved to show off, do crazy things, impress people. Some people even fell for it, including Beverly, my latest conquest. Beverly was one of those Hollywood brats. You know, movie star's daughter, but I thought she was really something, so I introduced him. BEVERLY: I like your friend. He's a little weird though. How do you mean? I don't know. Something about him. He kind of scares me . Jimmy? No. JAMES DEAN: OK, wait. You watch this now. [pop music playing on radio] Head down, legs together, [inaudible]. [pop music playing on radio] You're good. Did you ever think of trying out for the Olympics? No thanks. I'll stick to acting. Jimmy wants to go back to New York, get into the Actors' Studio, study the method with Elia Kazan. Like Marlon Brando. Brando, [inaudible], all the greats. Man, what I would give to get back East. Well, if you want to go so bad, why don't you just go? JAMES DEAN: I would, if my old lady was as rich as yours. Hey, I met, uh, James Whitmore at CBS to other day. He studied at the Actors' Studio. Well, why don't you ask him if he'll start an acting class for us? Well, I don't know him that well. What's the harm in asking? [pop music playing on radio] Yeah, I guess the worst he could do is say no, huh? [laughter] Now you're talking, Willy. Heads up. [yelling indistinctly] [music playing] William, help me. Come on, drown him. You're stronger than he is. [giggling] [music playing] MAN: First thing I want you to know, this is not a formal acting class. As a matter of fact, let me get something straight. I'm not here to teach you acting. I'm here to learn along with you. See, learning to act is a continuing process. Acting is a craft, a serious profession that takes time, patience, study, and a great deal of sacrifice. OK, now what is acting exactly? If I were asked to sum it up in one word, I would say concentration, total involvement. That's what acting is all about. To be or not to be? That is the question. Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune Or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them. To die, to sleep. [clattering] And by that sleep of death, to say we end the heartaches and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to. [chewing] 'Tis a consummation devoutly to be wished. [crashing] JAN: No, look at my dress. Why is he worth this trouble? He's just got a downright mean streak in him. [carnival music playing] WILLY [VOICEOVER]: It wasn't like that all the time. You never knew what to expect from Jimmy. I mean, one minute he was warm and friendly, and then all of a sudden he'd turn into a wild man. Sometimes he'd just sulk and refuse to talk to anyone. I guess that's why he didn't have many friends, at least not then. [gunshots] Come to think of it, he was the loneliest guy I ever knew. [carnival music playing] For a while there, we had some great times. Jim's sense of humor could get pretty bizarre though. Like you never really knew if he was being sincere or putting you on. With Jim, nothing was sacred. The point is, you were speeding. You broke the law. There's no excuse for that, is there? No sir, not even if my friend was depending on me. Friend? Yes, sir. The one who loaned me the car to go on the job interview. I promised I'd get back in time to drive him to the hospital. Did you say hospital? JAMES DEAN: Yes, sir. He's uh, he's dying of Leukaemia. I guess I just didn't-- I didn't want to let him down. Did you get the job? No, no I didn't. I'm still looking. $5.00. Pay the bailiff. Next case. [giggling] WILLY: Well, cop, I'm just a poor starving student trying to work his way through college. [laughter] [inaudible] [giggling] Of course [inaudible]. I couldn't believe it. [giggling] Hey, Bev, why don't we go to your place for a swim this afternoon? Well, I'll tell you, Willy, I kind of promised Bev that we'd um, uh-- Pardon? Jimmy and I were thinking of going out to my mother's house on the beach. Sounds great. For the whole weekend. Suits me. I don't have to be back to work till Sunday night. I mean alone. Oh. Nobody planned it this way, Willy. Honest. [music playing on radio] [honking] Now, don't forget, you hate each other's guts. You hate each other. Now, the watch isn't important. The important thing is who gets it. Here. I don't want to feel that you're just acting, OK? Now go ahead. Give me the watch. Why should I? Because it's mine. Give it to me. Go to hell. Who are you telling to go to hell? Listen, you little creep. Who you calling a creep, you phony? You're the phony. Go ahead, feel it, feel it-- [inaudible] phony. MAN: That's it, good, good. All right now, hold it. Break it up. I said break it up. That's enough. Come on. Break it, break it up, you two. What's the matter with you? Look, in case I forgot to mention it, you're not supposed to kill each other. This is just an improvisation. I don't know what sense memory or what personal experience you guys drew on, but uh, you're getting the idea. Oh boy, are you getting the idea. All right everybody, let's take a break. Go relax for awhile. [music playing] WILLY [VOICEOVER]: I don't know why I stuck around so long. I guess because he made life interesting. Never a dull moment, you know? And too, he was beginning to grow on me. He gave me the feeling that he really needed you. It's hard to turn your back on somebody like that. Anyway, it didn't last much longer. Well, why don't you move out? Couldn't just walk out on him, stick him with the rent and all. Well, he'd do it to you. No, Jim's too loyal. Oh-- [vocalizing] Look how he's been treating me lately. You call that loyalty? That's different. We're buddies. Well, if you asked me, I think he's acting like he's got a guilty conscious. Must be over Beverly. Crazy part is I can't seem to convince him that it doesn't really matter. No really, I don't care. I was never really hooked on her in the first place. He's welcome to her. Beverly who? Why did you go and tell her? I thought she knew. You sneaky little weasel. Sneaky? Look who's talking. You better keep out of this. You don't scare me [inaudible]. Go ahead, I dare you. Go on. I dare-- [screaming] Ah. Hey. Jan. [banging] Jan. I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. Jan, please. [banging] Jan, I'm sorry. [honking] Hey, come on, Willy. Don't be like that. I just lost my head, that's all. Yeah, right. [honking] I'll pick up the rest of my stuff in a couple of days. Rent's paid till the end of the month. Maybe you can find somebody else. Hey, come on. I don't give a damn about the rent. You're my friend. We're a team. We're going to stick together. Hey come on, we're going to take this phony town. [honking] Yeah, tell it to the judge, Deaner. [honking] Willy, don't go, Willy. You're the only friend I got. [honking] You don't need a friend, Deaner. [honking] You need a spectator. I suppose he cried and carried on like Faust. Why don't you knock it off? Oh, what's eating you? Nothing. I enjoy watching my best friend squirm. Hey Willy. Willy, I trusted you. I trusted you. [music playing] WILLY [VOICEOVER]: I didn't see much of Jim after the split up in Santa Monica. [phone ringing] We kind of kept out of each other's way. Then one day I heard he finally managed to get himself back east to New York, and I don't know if it was him or lure of the big city, but it wasn't long before I turned up on his doorstep. Yeah? What do you want? WILLY [ON PHONE]: Dean. That you, Deaner? Mm. Who is this? WILLY [ON PHONE]: It's me, Bill. Bill. Bill who? WILLY [ON PHONE]: Bill Bast. Hey, Willy. WILLY [ON PHONE]: Yeah. Willy. Where the hell are ya? WILLY [ON PHONE]: Right here, in New York. So after the [inaudible], I hung around Hollywood about six months, which was six months too long. Got myself a new agent, did a couple more commercials, met a few people in the business. Yeah, I even started doing some film work. Mostly bit parts, of course. Listen, work is work. I should be so lucky. Who said anything about luck? All you gotta do is know the right people. That's not as easy as you make it sound. Yeah. Gets to be a real pain though. You dance, they call the tunes. And who pays the piper? Well, he can always put it on the cuff. Split when the bill comes. WILLY: Well, that takes a little more style than I got. JAMES DEAN: You thinking of trying out for the Actors' Studio? If you are, I better warn you, it's rough. I'm still waiting for an audition. Well, I kind of decided to give up on the acting, Deaner, concentrate on my writing instead. You're going to give up acting? Well, let's face it, either you've got it or you don't. You got it. I see you still got your bull fight gear. Yeah. I don't get much practice here though. [stomping feet] Remember those practice sessions we used to have? Do I. [honking] Hey toro. [grunting] Hey toro. Hey toro, hey toro. [yelling] Hey toro. [grunting] Hey toro. [stomping] toro. [grunting] Hey-- [yelling] Hey toro. [stomping] Hey toro. Hey toro. [stomping] [yelling] [grunting] Hey toro. [stomping] Hey, hey toro. Hey toro, hey toro. I guess I'm out of practice too. You always did chicken out just before the kill. A momento de verdad. Moment of truth. Sure didn't expect to hear your voice on the other end of that phone. Don't know anybody else in New York. Besides, you always said, well, New York was where it was happening, [inaudible]. [chuckling] Well, shoot. I never thought you were listening. It's good to see you, Willy. It's good to see you too, Deaner. [chuckling] Looks like you're doing all right. These yours? Those aren't prints. Those are the real thing. Marc Chagall. French, isn't he? Um, Russian I believe. Sounds like you did some fast catching up. Some. Well, if these aren't yours, then whose are they? This belongs to the piper. Come on. I'll buy you some breakfast. There's someone I want you to meet. [music playing] That there is Dizzy Sheridan. She's a dancer. [laughter] [music playing] Willy. It's nice to meet you. Jim's told me so much about you. Welcome to cuckoo land. [laughter] What do you say? Let's go get something to eat, huh? Because I'm hungry. Hey, what am I doing playing in the park? I've got to find a place to live. [laughter] Where did you stay last night? The Y. Uh. [laughter] Yeah, you can forget it. [laughter] Poor baby. Where do you live, Dizzy? Us professional girls live at the rehearsal club. No men allowed. Damn. A-ha. Why don't you guys look for a place to share? Huh? What you say? I said, why don't you and Willy look for a place to share? [chuckling] [popping] [screams] [laughter] What are you doing? [laughter] Did I say something wrong? [laughter] May I have the key, Mr. Robin? How did the interview with the ad agency go? Oh, fantastic. They told me to come back, in a couple years. Well, it's a slow season. Bound to pick up soon. Jim come back yet? He was supposed to audition for a TV show today. Been up there all afternoon. Don't be afraid. Come inside with me. Hm. No. [sighing] Why did you break your head? Huh? What? When? Just then? Your eyes, they were so remote as if you'd come from a long way off. Another planet? Further. And then they focused and became very warm. What color are my eyes? They're sort of blue now. Sometimes they're hazel. Oh. You can change the color of your eyes, can't you? Sometimes it just happens. [door opening] Oh, uh-- JAMES DEAN: No, it's OK, Willy. That's OK. We're just uh, we're rehearsing a scene. Oh, this is Chris. Hi. Chris, um-- White. Chris White. Right. She wrote it. Hi. Hi. Scene for what? Uh, Actor's Studio. You got your audition. That's great. When? Um, about six weeks if we can get it right. Oh. Uh, in that case, I better let you guys-- JAMES DEAN: No, no, no. Stick around. We could use some-- [giggling] Objective criticism. [music playing] Maybe we should postpone. No, I just want to do it and get it over with. They're probably all in there, Strasberg, Kazan, Cheryl Crawford, Tennessee Williams-- Shut up, will you? Your glasses. You must have left your glasses They're probably in that restaurant. JAMES DEAN: Oh no, it's OK. It's OK. I don't have to see clearly. No-- I can sense. Burke and Marioni. No, it's too risky. Maybe we should call the whole thing off. The thing to do is just keep acting. Sculpting, racing my bike, everything in the arts is risky. That's why I don't own anything but these boots. Everything, everything-- all my clothes are either borrowed or bestowed. Did I tell you I'm learning how to play the recorder? What? The flute. The flute. If I can learn how to play the flute, then maybe I can dance [inaudible]. Will you slow down? You're talking a mile a minute. Let's go over the lines, OK? No. No. [phone ringing] [giggling] Are you as scared as I am? More. Paralyzed. I'm not going through with it. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Wait. Now wait a minute. Jimmy. It's my audition too. [music playing] RECEPTIONIST: McQuaid and Olson. [music playing] James Dean and Christine White. Excuse me, I'm White and my partner had to go get his glasses. And I was wondering if you'd be so kind-- I'm back. We're ready. OK. Where the hell have you been? Running. Take off your coat. Running? Where to? Just running. RECEPTIONIST: OK, right in there. Begin whenever you're ready. OK, go. [music playing] [phone ringing] WILLY: Anybody going to answer that? [phone ringing] Deaner, get the phone. [phone ringing] [dial tone] WILLY [VOICEOVER]: "Dear Marcus and Mom, I have made great strides in my craft. After months of auditioning, I am very proud to announce that I am now a member of the Actors' Studio, the greatest school of theater in New York." Never said a word. WILLY [VOICEOVER]: "Very few are admitted and it's absolutely free. It is the best thing that can happen to an actor and I'm one of the youngest to belong. Each day here in New York, I grow more as an artist. I see now that an actor must be willing to accept all experiences that life has to offer. In fact, he must seek out new experiences. To grasp the full significance of life is the actor's duty. To interpret it, his problem, to express it, his dedication. Tell Mrs. Hampton when you see her that I have never forgotten the thespian creed, 'Act well your part, for there all honor lies' PS, I would be grateful if you could spare $10 or so. I need it desperately. I'm sorry that when I write I always need something. Sometimes I feel I've lost the right to ask. I shall never forget what you've done for me. I want to repay you someday, but it takes time and many disappointments to achieve success as an actor. I'll try very hard not to take too long. If I've asked at the wrong time, please forgive me. I will understand. Love, Jim." [music playing] Jim changed over the next few months, a lot. It was like he suddenly found the key, some special secret, and it was beginning to open all the doors for him. Trouble was, I got the feeling he was leaving me behind. He practices and he practices, and he works his little fingers to the bone, but [inaudible]. He can't do it. He can't believe it. So he works and works, but he still can't do the passage. One afternoon, Schoenberg comes around to his house, and he says, would you play it for me? [inaudible] says, I would be only too delighted. So he starts and then he cooks, and he cooks, and he cooks. And he comes to the one passage and he can't do it. And he says, Schoenberg, a violinist would need six fingers to play this. [chuckling] Schoenberg says, uh, he looks at his watch and he says, I have time. I'll wait. [laughter] JAMES DEAN: Excuse me. [laughter] [street noise] Hey Willy, you awake? Mm-hm. Why did you take off like that? [sirens approaching] I don't know. I wanted you to meet everybody. It was your scene, Deaner. [chuckles] My scene. I didn't want to barge in. I mean, how were you going to introduce me? This is my dumb friend, Bill. See how funny he dresses? I felt out of place. They all look so, I don't know, important. They are. They're my friends. Oh Willy, Willy, Willy. You've got to get over that. What? JAMES DEAN: Judging by surface appearances. What is essential is invisible to the eye. Huh? "The Little Prince". Did you ever read it? Looks like a kids books. [laughter] There you go. You haven't even opened the cover. What's it about? Oh, cutting through the fears, the pettiness, letting people in, finding out what really counts. Do you want to hear my favorite passage? Sure. [clears throat] Well, it's about this little prince who comes from a very distant planet, very tiny star. And one day he meets this fox, and so he asks the fox to play with him because he's lonely. But the fox says he can't because he hasn't been tamed. So Little Prince asks the fox what tamed means. "To establish ties, said the fox. To me, you are still nothing more than a little boy who's just like 100,000 little boys. I have no need of you. To you, I'm nothing more than a fox, who is like 100,000 other foxes. But if you tame me, then we shall need each other. To me, you will be unique in all the world. To you, I shall be unique in all the world. If you tame me, it will be as if the sun came to shine on my life. You see the grain fields down yonder? Well, you have hair which is the color of gold. Think how wonderful it will be when you have tamed me. The grain, which is also golden, will bring me back the thought of you. Oh, and I shall love to listen to the wind in the wheat. [music playing] Well, the fox gazed at the little prince for a long time. Please tame me, he said. So the little prince tamed the fox. And then the hour of his departure drew near. Ah, said the fox. I shall cry. That is your own fault, said the little prince. I've never wished you any sort of harm and now you're going to cry? Yes, that is so, said the fox. Then it's done you no good at all. Oh, it has done me good, said the fox. Because of the color of the wheat fields. [music playing] Goodbye, said the little prince. Goodbye, said the fox. And now here is a very simple secret. It is only with the heart that one can see rightly. What is essential is invisible to the eye. Men have forgotten this truth, but you must never forget it. You become responsible forever for what you have tamed." [music playing] WILLY [VOICEOVER]: Of all the people he managed to tame, I don't think he ever did better than Dizzy. And of all the people who tried to tame him, I think she probably came the closest. [music playing] WILLY: Why'd you stop? Did you ever make it with another guy? [chuckling] Are you serious? I've got to prepare a scene for class. I don't know how to approach it. What's it about? It's about this guy, had a thing once with his best friend. Ever since it's been tearing him apart. That's a rough one. I don't mean kid stuff. Everybody does that. I mean, really. Did you ever? Did you? Why not? [laughter] What? Come on. I mean, I've known you to flatten guys for even joking about it. No, no. That was before I was committed to my craft. What's that got to do with it? JAMES DEAN: Oh, grow up, Willy. We're not in college anymore. This is the real thing. This is life, and that's a part of it. Ah, you know what Stanislavsky says, an actor has to be prepared. That go for writers too? All artists. We owe it to our craft to experience everything we can. What? Are you selling it? I don't-- Maybe some things are better left to imagination. No. WILLY: Even for an artist. No. Life's too short. I want to do it all. Besides, you know what they say. Huh? JAMES DEAN: Don't knock it till you tried it. [laughter] Are you kidding? I wouldn't even know how to go about it. I mean, if and when I was ready to experiment. What's going on? -Get dressed. -Huh? JAMES DEAN: Just get up and put clothes on. Uh, some jeans and a shirt's OK. What for? Where are we going? Oh, come on. Will you shut up and do what I tell ya? Hey, do you what time it is? I have to go to work in the morning. Just-- you've got to make certain sacrifices for your art. Bull. I bet Brando gets his sleep. No, no, this one. I hate that one. Can you shut up and put it on? You know, you're crazy. You get up in the middle of night, you get completely dressed-- why aren't you getting dressed? Uh, well, um, I'm not going anywhere. OK. What's the game? There's no game. Just listen to me and do exactly as I tell you. I don't think I like this. This may be the most important step you ever take as an artist. It's going to take guts. I know I don't like this. You know, the Aster Bar, over on Times Square? Yeah. What about it? I want you to go over there. Just go to the bar and order a beer. Yeah? And then what? Nothing. Just wait. What am I waiting for? You'll see. Things will start happening. What kinds of things? Things. That's what you're there for. That's what you're going to find out. I think one of us is nuts and if I go through with this, then it's got to be me. Why don't you do these things? Call me if you got any questions. WILLY: Deaner. Deaner. Deaner. [sirens approaching] [music playing] I must be out of my mind. Hi. Hi. I'm Ray. Bill. Glad to meet you, Bill. Can I buy you another beer? Sure. [phone ringing] Yeah? WILLY [WHISPERING ON PHONE]: Deaner, it's me. Where are ya? I'm at a phone in the Aster. How's it going? I'm not sure. Some guy just asked me back to his place for a drink. JAMES DEAN [ON PHONE]: Yeah? Well, what do you think I should do? Well, what do you want to do? Deaner, I don't think I'm ready for this. JAMES DEAN [ON PHONE]: Why? Don't you like him? WILLY [WHISPERING ON PHONE]: I don't even know him. Besides, that's not the point. What the hell am I doing here? Yeah, yeah. I guess it really ought to be somebody you've tamed first. I beg your pardon? I was-- it's my mistake, Willy. Come on home. [music playing] [stomping] I'm home, Deaner. Why did you make me do that? Huh? You was just using me as a guinea pig, weren't ya? OK, then why did you tell me to come ho-- oh-- what do you want from me? "It is only with the heart that one can see rightly. What is essential is invisible to the eye." I hate this town. It's cold, and it's dirty, and it's depressing. And you hated Hollywood too. That was phony. This is ugly. DIZZY: Where would you like to be, huh? Hm? Home, on the farm. This is the best time of year for it too. Leaves are beginning to change, harvest is almost in. Mom's starting to put up preserves for winter. Ma. My mama-- I can smell the home-baked bread right now. [laughter] Cut it out, will you? When do we leave? Right now. We could leave right now. Right this very moment. JAMES DEAN: Yes. DIZZY: Yeah? Are you serious? You can't just take off like that. Why not? OK, and what if this part comes up for Jim? [giggling] Oh. What part? Um, I auditioned for "See the Jaguar". It, uh, goes into rehearsal in a week or so. Opens in the fall. The fall? Yeah. It's a central character. He could steal the show. I have to get the part first. Nobody ever tells me anything. Oh, come on. I didn't tell you because I didn't want you to get your hopes up again for nothing. Mm. Besides, I heard they want Tony Perkins. I never heard of him. [laughter] When are you going know? When are you going to know, huh? Ah, a week or so. Well, guess that shoots the trip back home. Why? Indiana's not the moon, you know? If anything came up, my agent could let us know in uh-- he could send us a telegram. We could be back in 24 hours. [laughter] Well, that brings up another little point, trivial I know, but uh, where are we going to get the money for the bus fare? No. Oh. Willy. [laughter] What bus fare? [laughter] [music playing] [honking] WILLY [VOICEOVER]: The farm was like a tonic for all of us, but especially for Jim. Marcus and Ortense were just what he needed. He was home and happier than I'd ever known him. [music playing] [birds singing] The telegram cut short our visit to the farm, but before we left Fairmount, Jim had one last goodbye. From there we thumbed our way back to good old New York. Then on the night of December 5th 1952, the guy whose name I once said would never be up in lights had his name up in lights on Broadway. [music playing] [background chatter] [muttering] DIZZY: Well? Huh? [muttering] Listen, list-- listen to this. "James Dean, in an almost impossible role, delivers an extraordinary performance." Let me see. [music playing] [yelps] [laughter] I'll be right back. [music playing] I have the dumbest feeling something very beautiful is about to end. Don't look so worried, Willy. I might be cuckoo, but I don't believe in miracles. It's like our visit to the farm, it was a nice dream while it lasted. You know, of the three of us, I think I like you best. [background chatter] WILLY [VOICEOVER]: [inaudible] started making a little headway with my television writing. Seemed every time I picked up a "Variety" or a New York paper, there was Jim doing another big TV show, getting another lead in an important play. I mean, he was really going places. Deaner. [laughter] Hi Willy. What are you doing in Hollywood? Uh, grab your duds. I'll tell you about it on the way. The way where? JAMES DEAN: [inaudible]. Gadge wants me to get a tan before I start shooting. Gadge? Elia Kazan. WILLY: I don't get it. You got such great reviews for "The Immoralist". Why walk off a Broadway hit? I didn't get along with the director, so I gave them the notice opening night. Just to do a picture in Hollywood? What? For Kazan? Are you kidding? What's the name of it? "East of Eden". Good part? Lead. [chuckling] WILLY: Oh is that all? JAMES DEAN: How's the writing? WILLY: Eh, doing a little TV. Nothing to brag about. Hey, you ever see Dizzy? JAMES DEAN: Uh, she took off. Virgin Islands or some place to dance. Kazan thinks I could win an Academy Award for this role. They'll never vote me an Oscar though. Why not, if you deserved it? You've got to be loved in Tinsel Town, Willy. They're going to hate my guts. Who's they? The philistines, the dull accountants that sit behind the big desks and tell us what art is. Us, the talent, us, the creative people. That's why they hate our guts, Willy. We're special. We got the gift. The gods have smiled on us. They know without us, they're nothing. They come and go, we abide. You make it sound like it's them against us. I know the game out here, Willy. I played it for awhile, remember? You let them and they'll treat you like so much raw meat. Not me. Not anymore. You've changed, Deaner. I never heard you talk like this. Winged flights of harpies have escorted this trip of vengeance back to Tinsel Town, Willy. Only from now on, I'm the piper. They dance to my tune. Ah, why'd you agree to do it if it's such a lousy script? Because in this business, you take what you can when you can. [chuckles] Oh. Where's your integrity? Oh, don't give me that integrity bull. If nobody gives you a hand, you're on your own. You grab what comes along, right? Well, nobody gave me a hand out. I said a hand, not a hand out. I heard what you said and I'm telling you, nobody did a damn thing for me. Oh, come on, Deaner. This is me, Willy. You're trying to tell me nobody ever made it easier for you? Nobody opened a few doors, paved the way a little bit? That's right. You're damn right. What are you getting so excited about? Listen, nobody did a damn thing for me. I don't owe anything to anyone. Not one stinking favor, not one lousy penny. I did it all myself. I don't kiss anybody's butt. [phone ringing] Hello. JAMES DEAN [ON PHONE]: Hey Willy, what you up to? I'm just trying to finish this bugger of a script. Why? JAMES DEAN [ON PHONE]: They're sneaking Eden tonight over at the Ritz Theater. You want to come? Oh no, I've got to wash my socks tonight. I'm on my way. [music playing] [applause] JAMES DEAN: Willy, Willy. [knocking] Willy. Come on, open up. [knocking] I know you're in there. Come on, Willy, it's me. Come on, open up the door. [crickets chirping] Lose your boat? Willy? Didn't you hear me knocking? Sorry, Deaner. I didn't feel like talking to anyone. What's going on? Why didn't you stick around after the preview? Couldn't face it. Picture's that bad, huh? [chuckling] Bad. Why didn't you tell me so I could be prepared? I figured good, you know, but man, I wasn't ready for something like that. King Kong and CinemaScope. No, Bo. I'm really happy for you. Happy for me but a little sorry for yourself? I guess it shows, huh? [chuckles] Always did. Yeah. Only tonight, it really hit home. Maybe I'm dense or something, but so help me, I had no idea. I don't know what I thought you were up to these past few years, but I never imagined it was anything like-- watching you up there tonight, believing every word, every move, every gesture, all of a sudden it hit home. It can happen. This is what it's all about. It's not just some dumb dream. It's not a crazy kid game we've been playing. It's for real and it happened to you. You made it happen. You finally made it happen. RIVA RANDALL [ON TV]: Good evening. This is your Hollywood Reporter, Riva Randall, with an urgent warning from Marlon Brando. Watch out, Marlon. James Dean is stealing your act. Ever since his success in "East of Eden", Dean has been treating Hollywood to his brand of sick humor and crude behavior and getting away with it. But he's not calling all the shots, at least not yet. First, Elia Kazan made him stay off his motorcycle until shooting was completed on "Eden". Now Warner's has grounded him for the duration of his next for them, "Rebel Without a Cause". Too bad, Jimmy. Looks like you'll just have to walk up to your nightly haunt on the Sunset Strip of you want to hang around with those weirdo playmates of yours. [music playing] [clears throat] Uh, take off, you guys. This is business. I'll see you later, OK? [music playing] How'd you know where to find me? Are you kidding? The whole world knows. [chuckling] You watch too much television. Would you indulge me for a minute and tell me exactly what you're trying to prove? What do you mean what am I trying to prove? You can't make an omelette without breaking the eggs, Willy. Now I understand. [sighing] Anyway, this town's still full of phonies. It's the only way I can stay in touch with reality. Reality? You call these social rejects reality? [stammering] Is that all you see, huh? Just what's on the surface? [music playing] [door opens] See that blonde over there? Hey, see her? [music playing] She comes in here every night, always alone, and I'll just-- hey, come on. Please. Come on. Hi. You work over at the Oriental Theater, don't you? Yeah, in the box office. Yeah. Yeah, I thought I saw you there. Oh, this is uh, this is Bill. I'm Jim. Arlene. Would you mind if we sat down? It's a free country. [music playing] Tell me something. How'd you lose your leg? Motorcycle accident. Was it your bike? My boyfriend's. How did he come out? He didn't. Did you feel much pain? Only in my toes. [chuckling] Yeah. Yeah, I've heard that. It's true. [music playing] Must be weird. It stops after awhile. Did it leave a scar? That healed over a long time ago. See? Go on, touch it if you want. [music playing] [giggling] You know, you're the first guy who's ever had the guts to do that. You live far from here? Not far. Bikes scare you now? Come on, I'll give you a ride home on mine. It's just outside. [music playing] Reality. See what I mean? See you around, Willy. [music playing] RIVA RANDALL [ON TV]: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. This is your Hollywood reporter, Riva Randall. Well, will wonders never cease? As you know, I haven't exactly been James Dean's most ardent admirer till now. Well, I spent time with him on the set of "Rebel Without a Cause" and I've got to admit, I've changed my stubborn, old mind. Confidentially, behind that weirdo act, he's a charmer. And now director George Stevens has signed Jimmy for his upcoming "Giant". Is it any wonder? Warner Brothers tells me that Jimmy now gets over 5,000 fan letters a week. When I asked Elizabeth Taylor how she feels about playing opposite Hollywood's bad boy, she confided, I can hardly wait. Is that true, about the fan mail? Mm. Ah, look at this. Makes me feel like Miss Lonelyhearts. Any good ones? [chuckling] Ah, there's this one. Kid from Hollywood High, right here in town. Look at that picture. Is that a sweet, normal, healthy, sensitive face? WILLY: Took the words right out of my mouth. [chuckling] JAMES DEAN: Name's Norma Brookman. Bright, intelligent kid, lost. Completely and utterly lost. Letters that tear your guts out. She wants to meet me sometime. You're not considering it. Oh, I know, I know. You should read the letters. WILLY: Deaner, you're too vulnerable now. This kid's jail bait. You could wind up facing a paternity suit or rape charges. Yeah. That's why I want to meet her in a public place. With you along as a chaperone. I thought about it a lot and I know just how you must have felt when you tried to give your father all that money that you earned just for him and he wouldn't take it. Oh, you mean in, in "East of Eden". My mother's like that. She doesn't understand anything. That's why daddy left us. When you did that to your brother, I really knew why. I mean, you, you were just hurt and you were trying to hurt back. No, Cal was. Cal? Cal Trask, the character I played. Oh yeah. What's the one thing you love most, more than anything else? [clears throat] Um, life, I guess. It's our most precious gift. Not death? What? I read somewhere that you respect death more than anything else? Oh, well, respect, yeah, but that's different than-- death is the only thing left to respect. It's the one inevitable, undeniable truth. You said in it likes the only ultimate nobility for man. Beyond it, through immortality, the only hope. I said that? I've always remembered. Come on, let's walk. She got it in her head that somehow I'd understand. Understand what? Her. Her hopes, her dreams, her loneliness, everything. She wanted to turn her whole life over to me. She wanted to just dump it right in my lap. They're all like that, all the ones that are ripe. What do they see when they look up at that screen? Themselves. Unwanted, unloved, rejected-- No, no, no. It's got to be something more than that. Something more basic. They see the character you portray. They see a tormented kid trying to win his father's love. They see an alienated teenager trying to survive in an indifferent society. That's pretty good. [chuckling] You roll them all together, what do you get? James Dean. He knows, he understands. If only I could talk to him. No, no, no, no. It's the eyes. WILLY: The what? It's the eyes. It's got to be the eyes. What are you talking about? Did you ever notice how, how intense near-sighted people look? Like they could see right into your soul? It does kind of exaggerate your normal intensity. Well, and the windows of the soul. Isn't that what the eyes are supposed to be? Come on. Are you serious? You believe that all the movies, and fan mail, and people, it's all because you're nearsighted? Well, it's got to be that. What else could it be? [motorcycle revving] WILLY [VOICEOVER]: I'd say it took all of a year. Suddenly, Jim was the hottest young actor in Hollywood. True to his word, he was making them dance to his tune. Well, most of them anyway. Her name was Pier Angeli. For the first time since Dizzy, Jim had found someone he could really care for. Trouble was, she decided to marry the other guy. I don't think he ever got over it. [music playing] WILLY: Cute little guy. Where did you get him? Liz Taylor. [laughter] I love it. What's his name? I'll call him Marcus. [music playing] Little Marcus. [sighing] Hm. You look old enough to be my father. Hm? Oh, well, I shaved back my hair for the last two scenes of the picture. Really good job, huh? [chuckling] Did I tell you what they want me to do next? Uh uh. Rocky Graziano. Somebody up there likes me. Oh. You going to accept? Depends on the script. How's yours coming? Which one? What do you mean, which one? The one you're writing for me. The Jekyll and Hyde thing. [sighing] Deaner, I'd really like to but I-- I gotta take these TV assignments now. I mean, when I get a little ahead maybe. They offered me $100,000 for this one. Wow. JAMES DEAN: Let me take care of it. I appreciate your offer, but I couldn't do that. Don't worry. You'll earn it. [phone ringing] Want me to grab that? Yeah, would you? [phone ringing] Hello? Who's calling? Uh, he's busy right now. Can I take a message. Yes. Yes, I'll tell him. Well? Who was it? Remember that kid from Hollywood High? Norma Brookman? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. What does she want? WILLY: That was her mother. The girl took an overdose of sleeping pills. Where is she? They took her to Hollywood Receiving. Deaner, Deaner, she's dead. I'm sorry. They all die or go away. My mother died when I was wee, maybe that's why I'm me. I'll call you tomorrow, huh? [crying] [honking] Hey, I thought you were going up to Salinas? Ah, just leaving. Sandy's going to follow in the station wagon. Plenty of room. Sure you don't want to come along? I got a script to write, remember? Ah, can't it wait? Ah, not if you knew my producer. He's got a mean streak this wide. [laughter] I just thought I'd ask. You want me to stop by your place, feed little Marcus? Nah, nah. I gave him away. How come? You know what a crazy life I lead. What if I run away some time, never came back? Yeah, I guess. It's a lot of responsibility. Hm. Yeah. It's best he weren't so tamed to me. Listen, Deaner, thanks for the money. I mean, for the script. Can't hear a word you're saying. I got to split. You stick to it, you hear? [engine revving] I'll be looking over your shoulder. So long. [music playing] PSYCHIATRIST: All right. Let's get back to your dream. You say they came to get him and brought a coffin. What happened then? It was awful. Jimmy was clinging to the bed post. The attendants pried him loose. And as they pulled him away, he broke and ran to me. and held on. He grabbed hold of my shirt. He was crying hysterically. And then they tore him loose. He ripped my shirt trying to hold on. He was screaming at me. Save me, Willy, save me. Please save me. I tried to tell him I didn't know how, but the words wouldn't come. [music playing] Then he clung to the door frame and they smashed at his fingers until he let go. As they dragged him out, he took his fist and shook it at me. He was screaming, I trusted you. I trusted you. [music playing] And then before the door closed, a nurse stood in the doorway. She said, aren't you coming? That's when I woke up. [sniffing] And now I have this awful feeling that I let him down. PSYCHIATRIST: Because you lived on and he didn't? I guess so. I mean, he did so much for me. What did I ever do for him? PSYCHIATRIST: Is that the only reason? I don't know. No. I think it's because I never let him know. Let him know what? How much I loved him. [music playing] [birds singing] JAMES DEAN [VOICEOVER]: "This is, to me, the loveliest and saddest landscape in the world. It is here that the little prince appeared on Earth, and disappeared. Look at it carefully so that you will be sure to recognize it in case you travel someday to the African desert. And, if you should come upon the spot, please do not hurry on. Wait for a time, exactly under the star. Then, if a little man appears who laughs, who has golden hair, and who refuses to answer questions, you will know who he is. If this should happen, please comfort me. Send me word that he has come back." [music playing]
