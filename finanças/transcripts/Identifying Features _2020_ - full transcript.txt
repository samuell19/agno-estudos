I am leaving with Rigo. His uncle will find us a job in Arizona. They left a week after that. But it’s been two months already. The last we heard from them, they were taking a bus to the border. Perhaps they crossed the border already. No. My son would have called. To be honest, there is not much we can do. But my son is underage. Did he leave with your consent? Then there’s no crime to pursue. How come there's no crime to pursue? They are missing! What's that? It's what we can do for you. The feds send them regularly. Those are pictures of the last two months. Do you recognize something? No... IDENTIFYING FEATURES Doctor, your phone is ringing. Just a moment. We're almost done. I have a missed call from this number. Yes, speaking. But how can you be positive? No. I have to see him first. I can be there tomorrow morning. Yes... They called you already... It has to be a mistake... This body is two or three weeks old... Two weeks! No, I won’t wait till Friday. I booked a flight early in the morning. Yes, I imagine... I'll call you when I get there. Do you remember when they were little boys, how happy they were? When Rigo said he wanted to leave... Pedro got really mad at him. He didn’t even say goodbye... He didn't get to see him again... Until now... No one should see his own child like this. Maybe yours is alive... Perhaps Jesus managed to cross the border... I’m sure Jesus wouldn’t have left your boy behind. I really hope he's alive. Are you going up there? Yes... Don’t be hard-headed. Take it. You would do the same for me. It's OK. At least let Pedro drive you there. Thank you. Let's wait till the morning comes. Why did he have to leave? He had a life here... He had a good job with me... What did he gain by leaving? He wanted to find his own way. That's what he said. I could've given him money, send him straight to the border.... Instead I told him to do as he could... And now I'm helping you... If I wasn’t this stubborn... Nothing would've happened to my boy. It’s not your fault, Pedro. Nor his... Your son was going to be a good man. What's the line for? -You have to register first... Magdalena Loredo Martinez... Relax, it's just a prick. Have you identified many through the blood? I'm looking for my son... Last time I saw him was two months ago. The most recent bodies have been identified already. But they keep on finding shallow graves everywhere. With this sample... ...we can identify your son later. These samples will be sent to the city. The results will be back in 10 to 15 days. Tell me if you recognize anything. Do you recognize it? Are you positive? I, myself, packed the bag for him. What was your son’s name again, ma’am? But they said the most recent bodies were identified already. Listen ma'am... Many of the remains found in that grave were burnt... ...and there’s no way we can get a sample out of that.... This bag is the closest we’ll get to a positive identification of your son. What was your son’s name, ma’am? It's this one. I can't identify it. We ran the test twice, with your sample and your husband's. They’re both positive. That's not my son. If you don't claim it, It will be taken to the common grave. Are you threatening me? No. I'm only telling you that if you don't claim it... ...it will be taken to the common grave. Give me whatever you need me to sign. I couldn’t identify him. I just couldn't, Luis... Because it's not possible! They keep on saying the same thing... ...that both samples returned positive. They are going to hand over the body to me. I’m just waiting to sign the transfer papers. What do you want me to do? To leave the body here? You can't smoke here, ma'am. It's forbidden. Do you need help? I don't know what it says... Let me see them... This paper says that you identified a bag that belongs to your son. This other paper says that you agree that your son be pronounced dead. But I don’t know if my son is dead. The boy that was traveling with him was found in a shallow grave. And my son’s bag was found there too. But they haven’t found him. They say his body was burnt and that’s why they can’t find him. If you sign those papers... ...you'd be accepting that they stop looking for him. But what if he was really burnt? I received a call yesterday... They wanted me to come identify a body... They say it's my son, Diego... He went missing four years ago... He was driving to Monterrey, to visit some friends. He never arrived. We never found his body. Or his car. No one called for a ransom. Just nothing... I believed that I was going to find him anytime. In a store... ...on the streets... And every time the phone rang.... One day I woke up thinking what everybody thought... ...that Diego was dead. I couldn’t believe he was still alive, after so long. Yesterday they called me to tell me Diego’s body was found here. They say he's been dead for two weeks... Two weeks... No matter what they tell you... Don't make the same mistake. It's me Chuya... Sorry for calling so early. His bag was found. But not him I won’t go back till I find him. Please remain inside your vehicle. Wait for the green light before advancing. Have your passport and visa ready for inspection. Excuse me, sir. What can I do for you? Where can I find the line's office? What do you need? I'm looking for a bus driver... Go around to the right. Excuse me, could I speak with one of the drivers? You see, my son took a bus coming this way, and went missing. I'm sorry ma'am... ...this office is not for customers. But I just need to talk to a driver... I'm telling you, my boy might have been robbed... OK. Wait here a moment. I'm sorry ma'am. We don't have reports of assaults on any of the company's buses. Cintia, what's my route? You're on Celaya-Matamoros. And tell Pepe that he should come to get his. I just need to talk to a driver... I'm sorry... Cintia, what's my route this week? JuÃ¡rez-Tampico. You’re not from here, right? Don’t ask those questions in public. You don’t know who’s listening. This bus line has lost some buses. Some others have arrived without passengers... ...only with the bags. They keep’em in the warehouse. But they won’t tell you that. It's getting late. Do you have a place to stay? No... Ask outside about the migrants shelter. It's not far from here. Ask about Regis. Come in! Where are you coming from? From Guanajuato. Allow me to check your belongings. Are you carrying lighters, cigarettes, matches? No. - Any sharp objects? No. - Anything that can cause damage? Nothing? -Excuse me. Where can I find Regis? Regis is not here right now. She won't come until tomorrow. Please show me what's inside that other bag. Are you carrying a cellphone? - No. Look, I need to speak to Regis. What business do you have with her? I need to talk to her about something important. Well, she won't be here till tomorrow. Are you coming in? Or not? Can I stay for the night? Are you carrying any of the items I mentioned? - No. Then go ahead. Magdalena... Regis wants to talk to you. Can you come with me? Put on your sweater. It's cold. This way. Have a seat. Thank you. Carlos told me you were looking for me. That it was important... What can I do for you? I'm looking for my son. He took a bus coming this way... ...and I believe he was assaulted... Did he stay here? Is he registered? No. I was told to come here to ask about him... ...about the buses that have been lost... Who told you that? I don't know her name. But she sent me here. Your son was traveling by bus? When was that? - October the 15th. Do you still have money? Yes, a little. Then buy yourself a bus ticket and go back home. A lot of people go missing in this town. Some trying to cross the border, some when they're sent back... Or just for being on the roads... So really, go back home. I'm not saying this in bad faith. If your son is alive, he’ll call. But If he is not, well, he won’t. Do you want that to happen to you? Do you have children? My son might be dead... ...but I need to know. Look... The way things are now, it’s hard to know who to trust. And I don't know you. But all I want is to find my son. Please tell me if you know something. Here... Two months ago we received an old man. A very old man. He came badly beaten and very scared... He stayed here with us until he got well. He didn’t speak Spanish, so we didn’t know what had happened to him. We found a translator, but even then he didn’t want to tell much. He didn't want to press charges either. He only told us that he was on a bus that was stopped on the highway. They took away all the passengers. According to him, this happened on October the 15th. So I think it could've been the same bus your son was on. But I can't tell for sure. And how did he manage to get here? A farmer found him near the highway... ...and brought him here. What happened to him? I told you. He was beaten and confused. They stole what he had. But many arrive like that... If my son was dead, he would’ve been found with the others, don’t you think? I told you what I know. That's it. I have to talk to that man. Tell me if you know how to find him. Please. It’s quite far. You need to go to Ocampo. You know how to get there? From there you have to go to a rural community called âLa Fraguaâ. His name is Alberto Mateo. It's me, Chuya. No, I'm already in the border. I need your help. I can use that money you offered me. Thanks. Where are you heading? To Cienega. Last stop! Hey, this is not Ocampo. No. We don’t get there anymore. So, how do people get there now? They don't. How much would you charge me to drive me there? I'll charge 300, but I'll only take you to the slope. I only have eighty pesos. Leave me your shoes and I'll take you. All right. How long have things been like this? Since they killed Ocampo's Mayor. Of those who followed, none has lasted more than 6 months. This is it for me. Thank you. Be careful, man, this place is a hotbed. Hey! Wait! I'm not going to harm you. Do you live here? No... I'm looking for a place called La Fragua. It's on the other side of the dam... You won't get there this late... Do you have a place to spend the night? I'm going to my mother's house. You can stay with us if you want. How long have you been away? Almost five years... I couldn’t tell anyone I was coming back... Perhaps something like this happened to your son. You’ve seen how things are around here. Tomorrow I'll go with you to La Fragua. Won't your mom be mad, that I show up like this? No, you two will get along fine. They might have gone up north... I don't think so. Miguel... I’m going to my godfather’s to look for my mother. He’s got a boat. I’m going to ask for it so we can go to La Fragua. I used to play around here when I was a boy. I hope you can find your son. From behind, you almost look like him. From behind we all look alike. Godfather! I'm Miguel. Lupe's son. I'm looking for my mother. Godfather! Godfather! Let's go, Miguel... Miguel, is it you? It's me. There’s no one left here. Leave... Eat something. My mother wanted me to go away. She started saving some money to send me over there. I used to tell her we'd better used the money to knock this house down... ...and build a better one, bigger... ...with a room all for herself. But when I grew up, I accepted the money and left. I hardly sent her anything. If I hadn't been deported... ...I would have never come back. I need to go to La Fragua... You won’t find anyone that crosses the dam. You will have to walk all the way around. Hey, sir, I need your help. I have to get to La Fragua. I'm looking for Alberto Mateo. What do you want him for? My son went missing... And I think he might know where he is. Wait here. You can go ahead. Sit down. He wants to know why you’re here. To see you. My son went missing after he took a bus to the border. I know you were assaulted in a bus on the very same route. I want to ask you if you saw him, If you know something about him. He can't recognize faces anymore... My son was travelling with a friend that has... ...that had a big white spot on his face. He saw a man with a white stain on his face. But that man is dead. I know. He says the devil killed him. Tell me what happened. Please. The devil spared him. He let him live. But my grandfather wants to tell you he shares your sorrow. Miguel... I thought you weren’t coming back. I came back for you. You can’t stay here. Don't cross the border again... I have a small house... ...and a plot of land. it’s not much but we will manage. It’s enough for us to live. My boy... Your mother could still be alive somewhere. Come with me. Get up! Put your shoes on, we have to go. We have to go... No... Follow me... Miguel... I'm sorry... My mother used to live here... That's why I came... Our father who art in heaven... ...hallowed be thy name... ...thy kingdom come... Don’t move, mother. Wait here till we leave. You will hear the engine... Don't leave till everything is in silence... My boy... They caught me... ...and now I can't leave. Don't worry, I will send some money. You spit on me, asshole!! Today all of you are going to die.. Except for the one that kills this motherfucker. You want to kill him? You don't? You, fucking pussy... You thought you had balls ,faggot? Fucking pussys... Here is the copy of your statement. Read it and sign it if you agree. I can’t read that well. I will read it, then.
