You're always so aware of what's around you, and always so alive inside, and it got away from you. I think I fell in love with you. But you only loved traveling, distance, and your poor little psychology. No! Do you want to listen to Chopin? If you promise to behave... FISH OUT OF WATER I don't know if I told you. They hand over the house on the 20th. That's what we discussed last week, but I already explained to you that they talked about her, about her nerves. They should know Olivia is very sensitive, and any noise bothers her. All the moving around. - It's a shame we have to move. - Yes, it's so nice here. Well, let's wait for the 20th, and hope everything works out. For Olivia. Don't play with love, [illegible] better to play with a ball, [illegible] From your friend, Elizabeth For Olivia. Flowers in water can wither if forgotten. Friends who love one another, don't forget one another. From your friend who loves you. They left? I think I'm a bit nervous. Did you hear last night? They only laughed once. And look, when I practice octaves with this hand, it's very difficult. And this morning, right as I was focusing... Well, - I just lack discipline. - Go on. I think we can work it out. I asked for the room, but they said they'd hand over the whole house on the 20th. Just a few more days. And it's all my fault. Since I insisted... I mean, since we stopped with the academy... The academy was stopped because the doctor said so. Plus, the house was so much busier these days. You were trapped in the end, - and that wasn't your fault, of course. - Sure... I'm only responsible... for being like I am. You're very sensitive. Your nerves act up, but you're not the only one. This morning, when I went to tell them to be more restrained, I was overcome with rage. I won't sacrifice your happiness for money. They impressed me a lot. So young, so alone. I thought about my two little fish, abandoned, with no coat, her always laughing low, like she was ashamed, like... like they had never married. You think? He seemed so timid, like he was afraid. - Maybe, scared of her. - She wasn't his wife? - No, - not yet. - Oh! Then because of that, during the daytime... That's how it was with Carlos. Me, on the other hand, they all said I looked radiant. And you, Napoleon, you also never married? Josefina, it's not about you. Yes, I think it was the same for you. When you arrived, you had the same shocked face. ROOM FOR RENT They asked about the notice in the newspaper about the academy. I said we didn't have anything. I don't think it's good that you practice all day. You don't have to. I don't know, I feel clumsy. I told myself: "Esther doesn't need me or my piano." Sometimes when I play... I feel bothered, like I'm suffocating. You felt the same when you started playing. Remember? You're just too emotional. You heard me play, and you quietly cried for hours and hours. I didn't think that was normal, not for a girl of your age. Carlos and I said it was from your excessive love of music. Can you love excessively? Why did I feel so stuck? We sacrificed ourselves for music. It was for music... that we lived like we did. I feel so ashamed. I feel like music has scabbed over me. But if you feel music, you feel it. You had to consecrate yourself on the piano, on practice. That's why I had to forget music, and only focus on taking care of you. You're more talented, more gifted. It was natural for me to cultivate you, to protect you. Gifted, gifted... Being gifted is like nourishing water in a narrow barrel. I suppose I should start getting used to the idea. We had more fun when that couple lived with us. More fun? More in a daze, perhaps. You were more demanding than me. Why didn't you like that student? Which one? Oh, right... Oh, no! My lumbago again! I really don't know if you're the right person. I'd have to tell you what I like, and that takes time. Why don't you just come by when you're alone? You know something? Esther goes to the market every Monday morning. But it would have to be in the morning. No, we don't have a phone. The room isn't very big, but since it's only you... Or are you married? Maybe you have children. I heard voices. - It was a gentleman asking about the room. - You could have invited him in. He wouldn't have liked that. Bent over and walking like that. How crazy. Where do you get these crazy thoughts? The sugar. I'm always silly, Esther. Bah, don't pay attention to me. The piano, dreams, Chopin, and Ravel. Esther, let's go on vacation. If we don't leave here, then sure. You remember how much fun we had when we were single? - Did we? It was terrible! - It was, it was. We sat in these chairs, acting like they were an airplane, - and we flew to Paris... - London, Yokohama... And you stayed warm in papa's coat, since we were in Alaska. Do you remember that letter? The one signed: "A Lover," that said he would take you away some night? Mama said you had written that letter. What a joke. One day I'll write myself a letter, - telling myself I'm the happiest woman in the world. - Do it! If you think you are, it's true. In fifth grade I had a friend who wrote herself letters, but that was in fifth grade. Leave it, I'll take it. If you don't want to practice, why don't you read? Miss Olivia, You can't imagine how happy my husband and I are after that long journey. I'd kiss his feet of Prince Rainer. The President of the United States would like to invite the distinguished pianist to the White House, in appreciation of her performance. You can't catch me! You can't catch me! Take that! Wait, I'll come back. I can't do any more. - Does it get enough light? - Yes. I'll show you over here. Ave María purísima. - THE BROKEN WORLD- - A LOVER IN THE CITY- - CRAZY GOLD - - THE GRASS HARP - Yes... the life of an artist is lovely. Today here, tomorrow... Who knows? New faces. New horizons. Did you know I've been an actor since I was 14? I left home because I didn't get along with them. I knew my mother would look for me and would make me go back with great privileges. Meanwhile, I had found work with a company that was going to tour. So, at the last minute, I had to leave with them. Of course I did so with misgivings. It could be that I had been corrupted by the theater. I had done a few things, and they had clapped for me. Then there were other countries, other companies. Some very good, others... Who knows? I must not be a very good actor. For our departure in a couple of weeks, we'll play, Green Blood, by Giovaninetti. That's a powerful drama. I'd like to invite you. "Alone, yes, alone. Against their friendship, against their truths, against their rights, and against the centuries. Damn that old man. I hope his hate follows him to his grave. May terror destroy his bones. Damn me! Damn my blood! Damn love! Damn life, light, hope! And you, "What do you want now?" "And you, why do you look so tenderly upon me? "I don't want your tenderness!" - Wonderful. - Thanks. Well, that's not my true role. Mine is more humble. I'm trying to turn it into the first act. You play it well, and are made for the part. But i can't complain. Life has treated me well in the end. I like theater, but... I prefer seeing it to acting in it. Modesty aside, I'm a psychologist. A spy in the brain? Oh terrible! You won't get up early tomorrow? As early as normal, at 9? Art, madame. Art. Good evening. No. There's more. I can't find it. One of Carlos's old photos. It was in this box and I've lost it. Did you see it? It's Carlos with a certain air. It's his beard, the expression in his eyes. I can't find it. Since last Sunday, Julio keeps insisting on taking us for a walk, to the country. - Would you like to? - Sure. - I wouldn't. Are you coming? It's late, - and... - Come over here. Esther, I can't. The lecture should have begun half an hour ago. I swear, I'll drink something over there. Enough foolishness. Sit down. I said you'd forgive him. - It's new. - Yes. We'll have a dance one of these days. Last night I put the wrong sheets on the bed. - They had initials. - Sure, they were Carlos's. You know, you shouldn't read so much. You've caught the plague. Before you go to bed tonight, I'll make you another lemonade. You see why I don't like hotels? Why I don't read more "refreshing" things? - Victor Hugo, for example. - Still too romantic for me. I prefer Zola. Zola? He's so depraved. I don't know, in La Bête humaine, he describes two lovers in a shed... What's wrong with that? A man and a woman met. They're alone, it's night, it's raining, and they want one another. Plus, a shed is typical, like a bed. Fine, Zola wasn't depraved. How long have you been here, four weeks? And it all seems so changed. I've realized that, but it's time to open the windows. Last night, when Olivia was playing, you seemed lost in thought. I had reason to be. The music spoke to so many things... Every note glared in my eyes. The choler of the typical Chopin stopped, like silence, or solitude. The music, Esther, said that life was made for giving and receiving, not to be treasured. You see why the doors should be opened? What a strange idea. I think you see me as a jailor. Are they biting? Always so serious. Respectable. Silent. Sometimes, when I have nothing to do, I spend long periods of time looking at them. They spin about, come and go. They don't get bored of the same route. Have you seen them go hand in hand? On nice days they go to the end, and speak like old friends. And they laugh. And make huge bubbles up here, and explode, making a lot of noise. But when there are large clouds, they try to escape quickly, of course, and swim back, surprised, and don't try again. And don't try again. You know what happens? They've lost their courage. I've known them for years, and never seen them like that. But you believe me? It's strange. Because you've sometimes felt that strange desire to run away from home, because of your youth, or being in love. Not just a psychologist, but also a poet? A cheap one. Just a cheap poet. It's a good piece, but for my taste, I prefer... less lyricism. The public was ungrateful. - They saw the "Green blood". - Green blood and all. The troupe's been packing up since yesterday. Leaving? But you never said anything to us. I didn't decide until last night. - Decide? - To stay a couple more months. I like the climate, the people, and a Spanish troupe arrives in October. - What's wrong? - No, nothing. It's that I didn't know... I didn't think... I imagined you so tied to them. What's going on with her? If it were a bird and we were in my country, I'd say it means spring. I went to say goodbye yesterday... and it made me so sad. They're family. It was like going back to my childhood. Like escaping again. I said not to come tonight, that it would be dangerous. Yes, I think it's the best birthday present. I new piano, I really think so. No, - don't believe it. - But it's a wonderful gift. With the piano, she'd forget about the fishbowl. Anyway, she's the one who insists. She's the one who decides. I told her: "No, Olivia, be calm." "Olivia, no piano today." Stop making her a victim. Of course you didn't believe me, - and the tragedy is that I told the truth. - Of course, your truth. - Why are you my enemy? - Why should I be? Even as a child I looked for the most hidden desk, the ones farthest from the light. And I felt so happy when it rained buckets, surrounded by that intimate, grateful warmth of solitude. In my corner I liked to watch the water stream through the patio, and I would imagine that that small river, was the mightiest in the world. And I would swim across it to save my beloved. And when the images were more real, I would curl up with my scarf, feeling happy to be there, in the corner, and not in the middle of the river. I supposed you've told Olivia about these things. And what did she say? Well, you can't miss what you've never had, but sometimes it hurts. I think life has been unfair to her. And I've even thought about wresting her away from here. You know, I could never imagine Olivia outside of this house. Esther. - I already plucked the roses, and now? - Not the roses. What kind of trick is this? A gift, yes, but not a piano. You feel some type of remorse? I never thought I would have her nearby again, but I think she's changed a lot since last time. What will we do when Esther understands everything? No. That's unwise. No, no. You promised to be a gentleman. Esther and I would have sworn that you... Julio? Julio, please. No! Esther, I've got that feeling again. Like dreaming inside of a dream. What's with you? I don't know... I have... some kind of noise... - You know, Esther... - Yes? I was trying, and... it's strange, I can't remember. What do you want to remember? Everything I have in my head, this is white, this is black, I've decided with Olivia, how can you deceive yourself? Why can you not separate what you know, from what you only imagined? And Esther would like to explain... Esther? Esther! Yes, Olivia? Tell me, Olivia. No, nothing. She won't explain anything. She won't tell me anything. But you could, Olivia. Of course you've always liked to imagine things. Maybe that's what's happening now. Esther! Esther! Esther! Esther! It's over. It's over. Do you want me to go to the pharmacy? - Esther... - Yes? - Explain to me... - I already told you. The truth, Esther. However horrible it may be. But what version, Olivia? That afternoon, do you remember? We were drinking coffee in the sitting room, and were remembering tricks we had played. I said: "One day I'll write myself a letter, telling myself I'm the happiest woman in the world." And then you said: "Do it, If you think you are, then you are." But today is different, Esther. Julio already left. I don't understand. A man so proper, so sensible. Suddenly a beast. How can one descend so far. - Did he die, Esther? - Die? But you don't remember? He left, Olivia. He left? When? How long did I not realize? Yes. Now I remember. Then... Yes, but you know that I... You're so imaginative, I wouldn't be surprised. Those scissors, the ones I always had in the drawer. I took them from your hands when you fainted. Did I falling from the bed to the floor? You didn't clean the drops of blood? Didn't we carry him through the hall? - Didn't we bury him in the patio? - What a little fool you are. - What have you dreamt up to torment yourself? - Esther, tell me. Bury him in the patio? What foolishness! - Now the beets will be a deeper red. - Don't talk like that. Come. Come, let's go to the patio. But I want you to see, so you don't keep thinking about it. I won't force you to come, will I? Wasn't it over here that...? Don't you see? Why? - I'm scared. - Of what? Wasn't it near the wall. Come look, Olivia. Here, near the wall, there's just the hole we made to plant the poinsettias. Do you remember? Olivia. Olivia, if you'd let me talk to you, just once, to explain to you, I'd like to see you. For several days now, after... that, you've been so distant. You spend all day locked up, not talking, with a lost expression. Do you want to go for a walk? On Sunday, perhaps? It'll be a good distraction. Do you want ham, or cheese? I think... you should stop worrying. I'm not ready. Yes? I heard from him a few days ago. He explained what happened, and spoke about asking forgiveness. I... since I received that letter, it's like he's been wandering the house. It wouldn't be strange for him to write again. - No, it's impossible. - Why impossible? I mean... I don't think so. I suppose he'd already be comfortable, and wouldn't insist any longer. You see? We can be what we once were. We are what we were. Remember, Olivia: I'll ask your forgiveness once again. I still don't know what happened that night, but it's certain that I feel ashamed, sorry, and wanting to see you, to explain myself. Once of these nights I'll get the strength.... Slowly. Esther is a light sleeper. I can't stand it. My life with her is impossible. Should we leave? Maybe. Olivia. Open the door. Olivia, open up! Olivia, open up! - I'm leaving. - You're leaving? Where? I'm going with him. With Julio. He's been writing me, and he asked me... or rather... I think it's for the best. What is? Fool! Look at this paper. I wrote this letter. You hated him, didn't you? You blamed me, well I wrote this letter so he would stay alive and you wouldn't hate me, but the other letters... Olivia, look at me! You've been fooled! He died because you took the scissors. Liar. We dragged him through the hallway to the patio. But don't you remember what happened? Esther, this is the hole where we were going to plant the poinsettias. Why don't you go check? You know, Esther, I don't believe you. Olivia, if you're going to take everything... - No! - Take it all! Have you never felt a strange desire to run away from home? They have too. Look at them. All of a sudden they jump, like trying to escape, but of course, they hit their noses, and swim back, surprised, and don't try again. You know why? They've lost their courage.
