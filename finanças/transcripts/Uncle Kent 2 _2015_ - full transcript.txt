All right, start you engines, ladies and gentlemen! Forgot about it... Oh, yeah, it's crazy! Yeah, it's so weird to see you! Yeah, he's, like, such a boy now. Yeah, I kinda wanna tell him, like, "You're, your first movie was Uncle Kent." Yeah, 'cause that's wild. Um, and, uh, yeah, actually, I hadn't seen it in a while, and I watched it and I, I, I got this, I mean, , I got an idea for a sequel, like a part two. OK. And I wrote, like, most of it down. I've been writing all day. OK, what happens in Uncle Kent Part Two? OK, it starts off, like regular. I'm on my porch, smokin' weed. We hear sounds of the city, like lawnmowers, uh, dogs, stuff like that, and then, uh, it's night. I'm, like, gettin' drunk, I'm smokin' pot. I'm, like, drawin' comics and I'm, like, takin' pictures. Instagramming or, like, you know, puttin' it online. Waiting for likes, like, lookin' at my phone. Waitin' for likes, just livin' alone, uh, and then I go to bed, and then when I wake up, it's the apocalypse, and, - OK. And there's plastic on my windows, like, taped up, and there's like a survival, there's survival gear everywhere, so you don't know if it's the next day, you don't know if it's, like, a week later, you don't know, I don't know either. I'm like, I don't know what happened. I don't know how long I've been asleep. There's a note that explains that there's three months worth of food, and there's no power, there's no water. There's no, uh, internet, I don't know, I can't look outside, I'm, like, not, I'm standing on a chair in my, in my kitchen, like, knockin' on the ceiling, tryin' to, like, listen if my neighbors are up there. I don't know what's goin' on, but there's a note that says you have three months worth of food. There's a buck, I poop in a bucket, and so the first, like, third of the movie... OK. It's like Castaway, like, the first third of the movie's like me gettin' used to this. Like, you know, really sinks in, there's no Instagram. There's no Facebook. OK, it's just like you have to live without technology? Yeah, and without any contact with any people. All right. And I'm, my cat's, eh, dead, and I'm, I start, like, gettin' crazy, and I start talkin' to my cat like she's still there. OK, so then, this... Wait, hold on, before you describe the rest of this movie, I just have to tell you, like... Yeah, what? I just can't, I mean, I don't wanna be a dick, but, like, I hate sequels, man! Like, I hate the current culture that we live in where, like, when I go to the movie theater, all, like, my only options are, like, sequels to movies, reboots to movies, franchises of movies. But those are blockbusters! That's like Star Trek or... - I know, but making an in, - This is an indie. Making a sequel to an independent film's even worse, man! That's supposed to be, that's the counterculture! Uh, hello, uh, 911, yeah. You can stop the search, I found him. The only guy on the planet who doesn't like Godfather Part II. No, nah, I didn't... Huh, yeah, no, he's right here. What's that, uh, Gremlins 2, do you like Gremlins 2? What is that? No, he doesn't like, he doesn't like any sequels. I don't like any sequels. No sequels. I just don't think I wanna do it. OK, you, uh, it's weird, 'cause you only heard the first third. You haven't even heard, like, the twist. I, uh... There's stuff in there that's like, eh, it's OK. I'm sorry. You don't have to apologize. I feel bad, like... I have other ideas, I have a Caveman idea. It's about the first wolf that comes out of the woods. Let's just, like, hang out tonight and catch up and, like, see each other. I love you, like, I don't, it's not. It's not about that. Don't say, like, "Oh, you're, you've had a lot of success." Like, that has nothing to do with it. No, no, I was sayin'... I would make a movie with you, well. I was drinkin' it to get drunk! I'm gonna go get some food. I think I still have some pizza over there. Let's, let's go eat a little bit. OK. Everyone knows who they are? The people that are people know who they are, the werewolves know who they are, yes? OK, I'll take that as a yes, OK! Now, close your eyes, and, uh, I'm gonna set the scene. Uh, it's a bucolic university in the middle of, uh, in the middle of beautiful countryside, and you're all, it's the first day of school. And, uh, it's gorgeous grounds and everyone's very excited. Uh, this university happens to be the number one film university in the world, a place to study film. Uh, I know there's some actual filmmakers here, but there's also some writers and maybe some other people here just like to tell stories. But, uh, unbeknownst to everyone here, among you are three bloodthirsty monsters. They're posing as film students. They're actually film critics, and they fuckin' hate films. They, they hate everything they see, they hate you because everyone here, their dream project is to make a sequel. That's your only crime, you're film students that wanna make sequels to films that you love. And these film critics are gonna hunt down each and every one of you, starting tonight. Will the film critics please open their eyes. OK, I see, OK, we've got all three film critics. They're ready to, they're gonna select. Hey, Kent! Oh, hey, man. Hey are you leavin'? Yeah, yeah, sorry. Sneakin' out. It's good to see ya. Yeah, you, too. But, you know, I was thinking about it, and I just wanted to say, like, I, when I think about Uncle Kent, like, I feel like I came into your life. Like you allowed me to make a movie about your life, and so, I don't feel like I have ownership over it. Like, I feel like it's your thing, and so, if you have an idea for a second movie that you're excited about, I think you should make it. I think you should just find another director. Without you? Yeah, like, I, like, my feeling about it is that it's not mine to give away. Like, you don't need to seek my permission, that that movie is about your life, and we were shooting with your real name and your apartment and your family, and your work and all that sorta stuff, and so, if you have another idea that you're excited about, and you wanna make another movie with that character, with you, I feel like you should do that. You should just find another director who wants, you know, who's excited about that. Mm-hmm, yeah, that could work. Will you be in it, like in a cameo? Yeah, I love you, too, man. It was good to see ya. Yeah, bike safe. Thanks. All right, I'll see ya next time. - OK, bye, Joe. - All right. Beans.

Anyways, I noticed about a month ago, I used to get 'em once in a while, but I notice about a month ago they were, I was starting to get them every, uh, day. Every morning, actually, I'd wake up, and there'd be a different song in my head, and I started writing them down just 'cause I wanted to see if there were any sort of, like, patterns or if I could figure out why I was getting certain songs stuck in my head, but, uh, there's no real, um, connection between any of the, uh, the one I noticed is on July 5th, uh, I had Beat It in my head, and then on July 17th, I had Eat It by Weird Al, which is, like, the parody of that, but other than that, it's all...

You know, I've done this test with, um, some seven-year-olds and some eight-year-olds, and some six-year-olds, 'cause I'm also a pediatrician. And they get so scared! They get so scared by this, but when you're a child, your imagination just runs wild! Luckily, as adults, our imaginations are more in check. We can more, we know, what we're, what we're imagining and what we're not imagining, and why that's the case, but when you, when you're a little kid, you don't know, and you get so scared!

I need you to go see a neurologist immediately. Available tomorrow? Uh, no, I-I'm goin' out of town tomorrow. I'm goin' down to San Diego for, uh, work. Oh, my God. I mean, I have a train ticket, I have, doing two panels, I'm doin' a signing. I do not recommend that. Can I, I'll be back Sunday night.

A, a year and two months, and a week and three days. Um, do you ever, uh, do you know anything about, like, simulation theory or, uh, like singularity, like with AI? Did you ever, do you know anything about that? No. Do you wanna tell me about it? I've been having weird thoughts lately, like, uh... Like what? Like, uh, like that I'm a robot or that I'm in a simulation. I don't really know what simulation theory is. Simulation theory... I can assume... Simulation theory is fascinating. OK, we, so we, as humans, right, we're making technology, and we're heading towards a, towards a point, in our lifetime, there's gonna be artificial intelligence. There's gonna be a moment where, uh, robots or computers are gonna be able to perform faster than the human brain, right? Yeah. And so that's the singularity, and then, once you accept that that's gonna happen, then, it becomes much more likely that it's already happened and this is a simulation. - OK, because, yeah. - Because, It's like being the only ones in the universe. Like, it's more, it's much more likely that there's life outside of just us. It's less likely that there's just us. Right. So it's less likely that this is the first go-around. It's more likely that this is a simulation, and that you're, this isn't, like, reality. I don't totally love the idea that, like, this tree that I'm touching isn't an actual tree or that, like, I'm looking at this ocean and, like, I don't know, I just, like, I feel like the further we get away from, like, this, like, what we're here with and, like, living with, and the further we get into, like, our phones and, like, our Twitter and Instagram and Facebook, and, like, live in that already, like, simulation, you know? We're already so involved, if, we must be figuring it out, then, right? Like, we're already all so techy and stuff. - Yeah, yeah. - And reliant. Uh, I hate when people text me. Who's texting you?

I got this job that I'm, what'd you say? I had this idea for Uncle Kent 2. I thought you could reprise your role. Really? Yeah. Oh my God, that would be a dream come true! What a, what's the role, I mean, what's the movie, what's the idea? Really, um, OK, uh, OK. We open with me on my porch, I'm smokin' weed. I'm lookin' at the neighborhood with binoculars, and we hear sounds of the city... Cut to later, I'm in my kitchen. I'm doin' a comic, and I took a picture of it, and I Instagram it, you know, to establish the chronology Shut up! Holy shit, Kent! Sorry. What the fuck did you just do? I didn't do it. It's the singularity and it's been goin' on for, like, 30 minutes! How have you not seen it? Do you have a room? Yeah. Can I go to your room? Yeah. What the fuck just happened? Fucking weird! They followed me, so look, this is Miriam's... Is it safe? Yep. Where's Miriam? She disappeared, like those people. Oh, God, in this room? - Yep. - Aw, fuck! Oh, gosh! Explain it to me again, slowly. Uh, we open on my porch, I'm smoking pot, I'm looking at the city with binoculars. No, no, I'm talking about what the fuck is happening here! Why are those people just disappearing, what is... Oh, oh. None of this is real. This is like a video game or somethin', or a simulation, or it's the universe tryin' to, tryin' to gain consciousness. I don't know, I thought I had it figured out, but basically, everything's ending. Whatever this is is running out of memory. You know, like in a video game, you know, like the old school video games. You ever see King Kong, King of Kong. Yeah, I think I saw it. Like, it's the end of the game, half the screen, like, glitches out. The other half, the characters are, like, runnin' around, like nothin's wrong, that's us. We're in that part. We just haven't run out of memory yet. When are we gonna run out of memory? I don't know! I don't know. I have no idea, it could be a hundred years. It could be five seconds. That's so scary! I know. It's... I know, I'm scared, too. What should we do though? What? What should we do? We just gotta make the most of it. We gotta live, we gotta exist, you know? We're here, we're in this room, we're OK. You know, we're not hurt, you know, we could go like, in a second, we could go. I've seen it happ, you've seen it happen, it just happened. - The fuck? - I just. There's something I always wanted to do with you, in Uncle Kent One, and I just, can you take these off? Just take everything off really fast. Really? Yeah, just take it off. OK, woo-hoo! Oh, yeah, this is happening. Yeah. OK, no, no, no, no, - go over there. - Where? - There. - OK. Over there, turn around, face the wall. Face the wall. - Yeah, no face me. - OK. - OK. - What do you want me to do? I want you to start masturbating. You want me to what?
