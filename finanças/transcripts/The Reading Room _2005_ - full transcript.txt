- RECALLING THE LIFE OF HELEN CAMPBELL IS EASY TO DO, GIVEN THE IMPACT SHE COULD MAKE ON A PERSON IN SHORT ORDER. TO SAY SHE WAS A WOMAN OF IMPECCABLE CHARACTER, GREAT HUMOR AND LIMITLESS HEART BARELY SCRATCH AT THE SURFACE. TO POINT OUT THAT SHE WAS A DEVOTED AND LOVING WIFE STATES THE OBVIOUS. PERHAPS THE BEST PLACE TO START IS WITH HER CHARITABLE WORK. THERE IS NO WAY HELEN'S LOSS CAN BE LESSENED FOR WILLIAM, BUT HE CAN TAKE COMFORT IN THE FACT THAT MANY OF THE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE ACROSS THIS CITY MOURN HER PASSING AS WELL. THE THOUSANDS OF HOURS SHE GAVE TO HELPING OTHERS LESS FORTUNATE AND THE GRATITUDE OF THE COUNTLESS PEOPLE WHOSE LIVES SHE PERSONALLY TOUCHED STAND AS A LIVING MONUMENT TO HER GENEROSITY OF SPIRIT AND SENSE OF COMMUNITY. WELL, SHE COULD HAVE MERELY GIVEN GENEROUSLY TO THE CHARITIES TO WHICH SHE DEVOTED HER TIRELESS EFFORTS. FOR ALL OF THIS, THE MOST THAT CAN BE SAID IS, YOU WILL BE MISSED. - I'M GONNA MISS MY SISTER. YOU GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT, WILLIAM? - MM-HMM. - [patting on the back] [clock ticking] - WILLIAM... MY SWEET, SWEET BABY. I'M SORRY I WON'T BE THERE TO DO ALL THOSE THINGS THAT WE PLANNED. BUT I'M NOT SORRY FOR ONE MINUTE OF HOW WE SPENT OUR LIVES TOGETHER. WE HAVE BEEN SO BLESSED, BUT I CAN'T HELP THINKING THAT IF WE'D HAD CHILDREN, THEY WOULD BE A GREAT COMFORT TO YOU NOW. DON'T CUT YOURSELF OFF FROM THE WORLD. NOW, I'VE ASKED DOUGLAS TO LOOK AFTER YOU. TRY NOT TO ARGUE TOO MUCH. AND LET HIM WIN A POINT OR TWO NOW AND THEN. - [laughs] - EVEN THOUGH I KNOW YOU'RE ALWAYS RIGHT. AND DON'T LET MY ROSES GO. AND, WILLIAM, ONE LAST THING... I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT HOW TO PUT OUR BOOKS TO BETTER USE. I WANT YOU TO OPEN UP A READING ROOM. I WANT YOU TO OPEN IT IN THAT BUILDING THAT WE OWN ON FRANKLIN BOULEVARD, A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE CAN COME AND GATHER... READ A BOOK. JUST TRY IT FOR THREE MONTHS. THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO FULFILL YOUR DREAM OF BEING A TEACHER. I TOLD YOU I'D NEVER LEAVE YOU ALONE. I WILL ALWAYS BE THERE WITH YOU. LOOK FOR ME. I LOVE YOU... WITH ALL MY HEART, FOREVER AND EVER AND EVER. - WOULD YOU LIKE YOUR DINNER NOW, MR. CAMPBELL? - NO, THANK YOU, EMELDA. I'LL GET IT MYSELF LATER. YOU CAN GO HOME NOW. - THANK YOU. - HMM.

CAN'T YOU SEE THE WORK HE'S DOING HERE? - SISTER, ONE MAN'S GOOD INTENTIONS DO NOT CHANGE MY WORLD. - BUT THIS IS HIS WORLD, REVEREND. - WELL, THAT'S VERY HEARTFELT. BUT THE ISSUE IS LARGER THAN THAT, ISN'T IT? - WE DO NOT WANT TO SET A PRECEDENT THAT WOULD OPEN THE DOOR TO OTHERS WHO MIGHT WANT TO EXPLOIT OUR COMMUNITY, DO WE? I SEE YOUR LEGION OF SUPPORTERS IS GROWING. THAT'S A GOOD SIGN. - WHY CAN'T YOU MAKE AN EXCEPTION IN MY CASE? YOU CAN SEE WHAT MY INTENTIONS ARE. - I AM PUZZLED BY YOUR DETERMINATION. - AND I AM PUZZLED BY YOUR RESISTANCE. - THE RESULT OF MANY DISAPPOINTMENTS. ♪ - HEY, BOSS. - YOU DON'T HAVE A JOB HERE ANYMORE, JAVIER. - I KNOW I MESSED UP, BUT I GOT MY REASONS. - I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE REASONS. YOU'RE FIRED. - HOW COME YOU'RE SO NICE TO EVERYBODY ELSE AND SO HARD ON ME? - BECAUSE YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE SCAMMING ME. - YOU ACT LIKE YOU GAVE ME THE MOST GLAMOROUS JOB IN THE WHOLE WORLD. - IT WAS A JOB. IT PAID A GOOD WAGE. NOW, I'M GOING TO HIRE SOMEBODY ELSE. - YEAH, SOMEBODY ELSE TO SIT OUT FRONT AND BE YOUR PIT BULL. - OH, THAT'S HOW YOU SEE THE JOB? - THAT'S NOT HOW I SEE IT, MAN! THAT'S HOW IT IS! - NO! IT WAS AN OPPORTUNITY. - OPPORTUNITY? FOR WHAT? HUH? TO BE A FUTURE BANK GUARD? - WHAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU, JAVIER? IS SOMEBODY GOING TO MAKE YOU A MOVIE STAR OR RAP SINGER? - I KNOW NOBODY'S GOING TO MAKE ME THEIR PUNK. - NOBODY'S GOING TO MAKE YOU ANYTHING AT THIS RATE. LET'S FACE IT, JAVIER. YOU WANT THE MONEY. YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THE WORK. I'M SURE THAT YOU'VE HAD AN UNFORTUNATE BACKGROUND. NOW MATTER HOW DISADVANTAGED YOU'VE BEEN, JUST STOP BLAMING THE WORLD FOR EVERYTHING. YOU MAKE YOUR CHOICES. HERE'S THE MONEY. [door opens] - GRAB A BOOK, MAJOLI. WE'LL START IN A MINUTE. - NO READING TODAY, MR. WILLIAM. - HMM... [laughs] - YAY! - COME ON, PASS ME THE BALL! - YAY! - COME ON! YEAH! - GOT YOU. - GIVE IT TO MR. WILLIAM. - SHOOT IT. all: [cheering] - EDGAR! GO, EDGAR! - I GOT IT! I GOT IT! OH YEAH, LOOK AT THAT. - [cheering] GO EDGAR! OW! I MISSED! YAY, MR. WILLIAM! - YAY! - I'VE GOT TO GO. - LATER. BYE, MR. WILLIAM. [distant fire engines] - YO, JAVIER. HE'S GOT NEW COMPUTERS IN THAT PLACE NOW, DOESN'T HE? - LEAVE IT ALONE, MAN. - HEY, WHAT DO YOU MEAN? YOU'VE GOT A KEY, RIGHT? I MEAN, YOU'VE BEEN OPENING UP THAT PLACE FOR HIM. - JUST LET IT GO, CUZ! - WHAT IS WITH YOU, MAN? YOU DON'T OWE THAT SUCKER NOTHING. - IT'S NOT WORTH IT. JUST LEAVE IT ALONE. [group grumbles] - TRIPPIN'. - YOU LOST IT, MAN. - HEY... I'M THE ONE AROUND HERE WHO SAYS WHAT'S WORTH IT. - NOT FOR ME. - MAN, THAT FOOL CRAZY, DOG, KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? - OK, PRIMO. YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IT? JUST GIVE US THE KEY. HEY, MAN, WE'RE BLOOD. WHY YOU SIDING WITH THIS GUY? HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT YOU. GIVE ME THE KEY, AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. - NO! - VENGA, ESE. - MAN, I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE DOING THIS, MAN. EVER SINCE YOU WERE A KID I TOOK CARE OF YOU, LET YOU HANG AROUND ME. - YOU TOOK CARE OF ME, HUH? YOU JUST WANTED ME TO HANG AROUND TO MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE A BIG MAN! - HEY! WHERE YOU GOING?! WHAT? NOW YOU GOT THIS JOB, AND YOU THINK YOU'RE BETTER THAN ME? YOU AIN'T GOING BACK THERE. I PROMISE YOU THAT. - LITTLE PUNK. [phone rings] - HELLO? - ANYBODY ELSE IN THERE? - NOTHING. [men talking] [siren wails] [thunder rolls] - [sighs] [thunder rolls] - WHAT'S UP, REV? - HELLO, REVEREND. - HELLO. MY BROTHER. SISTER. - NICE TO SEE YOU, REVEREND. - WHERE ARE YOU GOING, BROTHER CAMPBELL? DON'T YOU SEE THERE'S WORK TO BE DONE HERE? THIS IS OUR COMMUNITY! THIS IS OUR NEIGHBORHOOD! all: [agreeing] - THIS IS OUR HOUSE! - THAT'S RIGHT. - WE MUST NOT LET THEM DO THIS TO OUR HOUSE. WHO'S GONNA JOIN US? ARE YOU GONNA JOIN US? ARE YOU GONNA JOIN US? ARE YOU GONNA JOIN US, BROTHER CAMPBELL? [people talking excitedly] all: [oohing and ahhing] - ALL RIGHT, PILE ALL THE TRASH IN THE CENTER HERE. TRY AND SALVAGE AS MANY BOOKS AS POSSIBLE. PUT THEM ON THE SHELVES. ALL RIGHT, GOOD FRIENDS, GOOD WORK, GOOD WORK. NOW, IT'S TIME TO TAKE THE TRASH OUT. [general chatter] - YOU NEED SOME MORE HELP? - ALWAYS. SO... DO YOU KNOW WHO DID THIS? - I'VE GOT SOME IDEA. - HAVE YOU GOTTEN ANY PROOF? - NOT REALLY. - THAT WASN'T YOU WHO BROKE INTO THIS PLACE AND TOOK THE COMPUTER, WAS IT? - NO. - WHY'D YOU COVER FOR HIM? - HE'S ALREADY GONE TO JAIL. HE'D DO HARD TIME. THAT'S WHAT YOU DO FOR FAMILY. AT LEAST, THAT'S WHAT I USED TO THINK. HOW'D YOU KNOW? - JUST A HUNCH. I'VE GOTTEN ACQUAINTED WITH YOU A LITTLE. - OK, WHAT'S "A"'S BEST FRIEND? - "I." - SOUND IT OUT. - W...WAIT. W-A-I-T. [low chatter] - PICKED UP SOME MORE MAGAZINES. - OH, GREAT. - [sighs] I'M BURNT OUT. - YOU'LL DO GREAT TOMORROW. - WELL... - YOU'LL BE FINE. - WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO BE? - IT'S A COLLAGE, FOOL. [snickers] - YO, WHATEVER. both: [laughing] - CAN I WALK YOU TO YOUR CAR? - YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD STAY AWAY FROM HIM. THE MAN'S GOT NO RESPECT FOR WOMEN. - [laughs nervously] UM, YEAH, YOU CAN WALK ME OUT. - BYE, JILLIAN. - SEE YOU NEXT WEEK, KIDDO. - YOU KNOW, I WOULD HATE HER IF SHE WASN'T SO NICE. - I HATE HER ANYWAY. - GIRL, YOU JUST SPITEFUL. - NO, I AIN'T. LOOK WHO'S TALKING. - DARRYL! COME HERE. YOU'RE GOING TO PASS THAT TEST TOMORROW. I'VE SEEN HOW HARD YOU WORK, AND I KNOW HOW SMART YOU ARE. - I LIKE YOUR HAIR. - THEY'RE EXTENSIONS. - YOU LOOK NICE. - THANK YOU. YOU KNOW, THE WORLD DOESN'T HAVE TO KNOW THAT THEY'RE EXTENSIONS. - THE WHOLE WORLD KNOWS THAT YOUR TEXTURE DIDN'T CHANGE OVERNIGHT, LEESHA. - WHATEVER. - YOU SURE DID GET THINGS UP AND RUNNING AGAIN QUICKLY. - HOW DO YOU LIKE THE NEW LOOK? - I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL. - MS. WESTON. LOOK, I'M READING A BOOK ABOUT SNAKES. - THAT'S WONDERFUL, EDGAR. DON'T YOU HAVE TO GO HOME SOON? - YEAH. - OK. DO YOU LIKE LASAGNA? SO YOU LIVE ON THE SOUTHSIDE? - YES. - WHEREABOUTS? - CRESCENT HILLS. - YOU MUST HAVE HAD A VERY GOOD JOB BEFORE YOU OPENED UP THE READING ROOM. - I OWNED A FACTORY. FANFARE PICTURE FRAMES. IT WAS MY FAMILY'S BUSINESS. I WAS RAISED RIGHT OVER HERE ON STEWART STREET. - SO YOU SOLD THAT BUSINESS? - YEAH, TO A GROUP OF INVESTORS. AND THEN HELEN AND I WERE GOING TO DO SOME TRAVELING. YOU KNOW, THIS WAS VERY GOOD. - YOU'RE REALLY GOOD WITH KIDS, YOU KNOW. - I WANTED TO BE A TEACHER ONCE. - WHY DIDN'T YOU? - MM. [clears throat] I LEFT GRADUATE SCHOOL TO TAKE OVER THE FAMILY BUSINESS AND NEVER WENT BACK. - YOU NEVER HAD KIDS OF YOUR OWN? - NO, WE COULDN'T. YOU KNOW, BACK IN THE DAY WHEN WE WERE MARRIED, THEY DIDN'T HAVE ALL THAT TECHNOLOGY. [clears throat] WHEN A WOMAN WAS TOLD THAT SHE COULDN'T HAVE BABIES, SHE JUST RESIGNED HERSELF TO THE FACT. - AND WHAT ABOUT ADOPTION? - WE TALKED ABOUT IT. I WAS STUBBORN. I WANTED MY OWN. IT WAS A BIG MISTAKE. WHEN I LOOK AROUND AND I SEE THESE YOUNG PEOPLE LIKE JILLIAN, I SAY TO MYSELF: "SHE COULD HAVE BEEN MY DAUGHTER. WE COULD HAVE HAD A FAMILY." HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN A TEACHER? - 25 YEARS. - MUST BE VERY GRATIFYING. - IT'S ACTUALLY GUT-WRENCHING. [laughs] I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT. A CLASS OF EIGHT-YEAR-OLDS WITH EVERY PROBLEM IN THE BOOK. HALF OF THEM WON'T EVEN GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL, AND A VERY SMALL FRACTION OF THEM WILL EVEN THINK ABOUT GOING ON TO COLLEGE. LAST WEEK, THIS, UH-- THIS YOUNG MAN CAME INTO MY CLASS AND GAVE ME A BIG HUG. AND IT TURNS OUT HE WAS ONE OF MY FIRST STUDENTS AND NOW IS A THIRD-YEAR RESIDENT. - THAT COUNTS FOR SOMETHING. - IT COUNTS FOR EVERYTHING. - "ONE FISH, TWO FISH, RED FISH, BLUE FISH," BY DOCTOR SEUSS. I'LL READ THE WORDS, AND YOU POINT TO THE PICTURES. OK? - OK. - "ONE FISH, TWO FISH, RED FISH, BLUE FISH. "BLACK FISH, BLUE FISH, OLD FISH, NEW FISH. "THIS ONE HAS A LITTLE STAR. THIS ONE HAS A LITTLE..." - CAR! - "SAY, WHAT A LOT OF FISH THERE ARE." - MAJOLI? - MAMA, MAJOLI'S TEACHING ME TO READ. - THAT'S GOOD, BABY. YOU BOTH BE HOME BY 5:00, YOU HEAR? - WE WILL, MAMA. "YES, SOME ARE RED, AND SOME ARE BLUE. "SOME ARE OLD, AND SOME ARE NEW. "SOME ARE SAD, AND SOME ARE GLAD. SOME ARE VERY, VERY BAD." - AH, HOW YOU DOING? - AH, HI, MRS. WING. HEY. - NICE TO SEE YOU. - YOU NEED A HAIRCUT. - [laughs] - [crying] - LEESHA? WHAT'S WRONG? - MY STEPDAD BEAT ME UP. - WHAT? - HE'S DRUNK. HE SAID I BURNT HIS DINNER. BUT HE DOESN'T NEED AN EXCUSE. - YOU'D BETTER CALL THE POLICE. - NO! NO, IF YOU PUT HIM IN JAIL, MY MOM'S GONNA BLAME ME. HE'LL BE FINE TOMORROW. [groans] - WHAT'S WRONG? - MY SIDE. IT REALLY HURTS. - WE'D BETTER GET HER TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM. [siren] - DOCTOR JENNINGS TO RADIOLOGY. - HOW IS SHE, DOCTOR? - SHE HAS A FRACTURED RIB THAT'S PUSHING ON HER LUNG. I BANDAGED UP HER RIBS, BUT SHE'S STILL IN A BIT OF PAIN. I'D LIKE TO KEEP HER HERE OVERNIGHT. YOU CAN GO AND SEE HER NOW. - THANK YOU, DOCTOR. [machines beeping] - NURSE OWENS, 64-24... - [sighs] - HOW DO YOU FEEL? - NOT SO BAD. I'M SORRY, MR. CAMPBELL. - SORRY ABOUT WHAT? - I'M NOT GOOD FOR ANYTHING. - THAT'S NOT TRUE. - IT IS. WHAT HAVE I EVER DONE? - REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST OPENED THE READING ROOM AND OMAR AND THOSE GUYS CAME BY? YOU WERE THE ONLY ONE WHO SHOWED ANY CONCERN FOR ME. - WHAT DO YOU MEAN? BECAUSE I TOLD YOU NOT TO MESS WITH THEM? - NOT JUST THAT. YOU WERE ON MY SIDE. I FELT LIKE YOU WERE THE ONLY PERSON, AND WHENEVER I SEE YOU, THAT'S WHAT I REMEMBER. - I ONLY WANTED THE MAGAZINES. [laughs] - I DON'T BELIEVE THAT FOR A SECOND. - LOOK, I'M GONNA PAY YOU BACK FOR THESE MEDICAL BILLS. - YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY ME BACK. YOU JUST REST NOW. - DARRYL? - 920. - LEAVE ME ALONE. - WHAT HAPPENED? - LEAVE ME ALONE! - I NEED AN EXPLANATION. - THE EXPLANATION IS, I'M STUPID. - THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME MISTAKE. - THERE'S NO MISTAKE. GO AWAY. IT'S OVER WITH. - I NEED TO KNOW HOW YOU COULD DO SO BADLY ON THE TEST. - I READ TOO SLOW. IT TAKES ME A WHILE TO SORT OUT THE WORDS. I'VE BEEN FAKING IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH SCHOOL. - HOW ABOUT THE PRACTICE TEST? - I MEMORIZED THOSE. - TO IMPRESS YOU. JILLIAN, EVERYBODY. ON THE REAL TEST WHEN THE TIME WAS UP, I HADN'T EVEN MADE IT THROUGH THE SECOND READING SECTION. I GUESSED ON ALL THE OTHERS. - WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US? WE COULD HAVE HELPED YOU. YOU'VE SEEN HOW JILLIAN WORKS WITH THE KIDS. - I'M NOT A KID! I'M 17 YEARS OLD! - MAYBE YOU COULD TAKE IT AGAIN. - NO, I CAN'T. IT'S OVER. - YOU DIDN'T MEMORIZE THE MATH. YOU GOT 680 IN THAT. THAT'S IN THE 90th PERCENTILE. - WILL YOU JUST FORGET IT?! - MAYBE WE CAN LET THEM KNOW ON THE APPLICATION THAT YOU HAVE THIS PROBLEM. - WHY YOU CARE SO MUCH WHAT HAPPENS TO ME? - THE REAL QUESTION IS WHY YOU'RE SURPRISED THAT I CARE. MY WIFE HAD A THEORY: THE MORE CARE YOU BRING INTO THE WORLD, THE LESS ROOM THERE IS FOR HATE. - IS THAT WHY YOU CAME DOWN HERE? TO HONOR YOUR WIFE? COLLEGE ISN'T EVERYTHING. - COLLEGE IS WHERE YOU BELONG. - A 920 ON YOUR SAT DOESN'T GET YOU THAT. IT ONLY GETS YOU WORKING AT THE TIRE STORE. - WHAT HAPPENED? - HE SAYS HE READS TOO SLOW. ALL THOSE PRACTICE TESTS, HE'S BEEN MEMORIZING THEM JUST TO IMPRESS US. - READS TOO SLOW? - IT TAKES HIM A WHILE TO SORT IT OUT. - WELL, HE CAN TAKE AN UNTIMED TEST. LOTS OF STUDENTS DO IT. DYSLEXICS, BLIND, DEAF. THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF EXEMPTIONS. [school bell ringing] - THIS IS SO RARE DOWN HERE. THE STUDENT NEEDS TO BE TESTED, A SPECIFIC DIAGNOSIS. A COUNSELOR NEEDS TO COORDINATE THE ENTIRE PROCESS. WE NEED TO ARRANGE FOR TIME, APPOINT A PROCTOR FOR THE EXAM. - YOU'RE TELLING ME IT'S JUST TOO MUCH TROUBLE TO ALLOW THIS KID TO HAVE A SHOT AT A FUTURE. - WHAT I'M SAYING IS, IT'S A LOT MORE COMPLICATED THAN YOU IMAGINE. - I CAN HANDLE THE COMPLICATIONS. - THE TRUTH IS, SOME STUDENTS JUST DON'T TEST WELL. - THE TRUTH IS THAT THE TESTING PROCESS IS FLAWED. - LOOK, MR. CAMPBELL, THE COMMUNITY IS VERY APPRECIATIVE OF WHAT YOU'VE DONE. - THEN SHOW YOUR APPRECIATION BY ALLOWING DARRYL TO RETAKE HIS SAT. - WHAT I SEE HERE IS VERY CONSISTENT WITH HIS RECORD. PSAT SCORE WAS, WELL, ITS EQUIVALENT. HE'S ALWAYS BEEN STRONG IN MATH AND QUITE AVERAGE IN HIS VERBAL SUBJECTS. - THAT'S BECAUSE HE CAN'T READ. - THAT'S A BIT OF AN EXAGGERATION. I DON'T SEE ANY DROP OFF HERE FROM-- - NO, FORGET THE FILE. I KNOW THIS KID. HE'S SMART. HE BELONGS AT A UNIVERSITY. ALL HE NEEDS IS FOR YOU TO HELP HIM TAKE AN UNTIMED SAT. MAN, DO THESE KIDS HAVE TO FIGHT WITH EVERYBODY? - HE'LL NEED TO BE TESTED. GET A LEGITIMATE DIAGNOSIS. - I'LL TAKE CARE OF THAT. WILL YOU HELP WITH THE REST? - AS YOU SUSPECTED, DARRYL HAS A READING VARIANCE, A DECODING PROBLEM THAT IMPAIRS HIS PROCESSING SPEED. I HAVE NO PROBLEM RECOMMENDING THAT HE TAKE AN UNTIMED SAT. YOU CAN SEE THAT DARRYL IS EXTREMELY BRIGHT IN ALMOST ALL AREAS. THE AREAS WHERE HIS SCORES FALL OFF-- - SO YOU THINK I COULD GO TO COLLEGE? - GIVEN THE TESTING I'VE DONE, I NOT ONLY THINK YOU CAN GO TO COLLEGE, I THINK YOU CAN GET AN ACADEMIC SCHOLARSHIP. - WHAT KIND OF SAT SCORE WOULD HE NEED FOR A SCHOLARSHIP? - SOMETHING OVER 1400. ♪ - THIS TEST WILL BE UNTIMED. WE WILL HAVE BREAKS AT 90-MINUTE INTERVALS. YOU MAY BEGIN THE TEST NOW. [student coughing] - THANK YOU. - OK. SEND ME THE POLICY, AND, UH, I'LL TAKE A LOOK AT IT. I GOT A GUY THAT SAYS HE CAN SAVE US 600 ON INSURANCE. - BILL... - I ALSO ORDERED THOSE BOOKS YOU WANTED. - BILL... "MR. DARRYL JAMES BARBER." - I CAN'T BEAR TO DO IT. YOU OPEN IT. - MM. OH... THERE MUST BE SOME MISTAKE. SAYS YOU GOT A 1540. - WHAT?! - [laughs] - YOU MUST BE SOME GENIUS. - LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO COLLEGE. YEAH. [laughs] - I'M GOING TO COLLEGE. - CONGRATULATIONS. WOW. [kids yelling] - OK, COME ON IN. FORM A CIRCLE, EVERYBODY. - HI. - FORM A CIRCLE. COME ON, HURRY UP. - HI. - HELLO. - ALL RIGHT, CLASS. THIS IS THE READING ROOM. NOW, IF THERE'S EVER A BOOK THAT YOU CAN'T FIND IN THE SCHOOL LIBRARY, YOU CAN JUST COME HERE. NOW, I HAVE A SURPRISE FOR YOU. TAKE A SEAT. ANYWHERE YOU CAN FIND ONE, OK? [kids talking] - "BELIEVE IN YOURSELF. "SET YOUR STANDARDS HIGH. YOU DESERVE THE BEST. "TRY FOR WHAT YOU WANT, AND NEVER SETTLE FOR LESS. "BELIEVE IN YOURSELF, NO MATTER WHAT YOU CHOOSE. "KEEP A WINNING ATTITUDE, AND YOU CAN NEVER LOSE. "THINK ABOUT YOUR DESTINATION, BUT DO NOT WORRY IF YOU STRAY. "BECAUSE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING "IS WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNED ALONG THE WAY. "TAKE ALL THAT YOU'VE BECOME TO BE ALL YOU CAN BE. SOAR ABOVE THE CLOUDS, AND LET YOUR DREAMS SET YOU FREE." all: [clapping and cheering] - GOOD JOB, EDGAR! - [whistling] - GOOD JOB! - YOU DID IT! all: [cheering] - [whistling] [party music on boom box] - MMM! THE WINNER. - WOULD YOU LIKE SOME SODA, WILLIAM? - THANK YOU. WE HAVE A NEW VIDEO GAME ABOUT A DETECTIVE. YOU HAVE TO LOOK UP INFORMATION TO SOLVE THE CRIME. - MR. CAMPBELL, I'VE GOT SOME GOOD NEWS AND SOME BAD NEWS. - UH-OH. - THE BAD NEWS IS, I'M GIVING YOU MY NOTICE. I'M GOING TO GO NEXT DOOR AND WORK AT MARTHA'S. SHE GAVE ME A JOB DOING COLOR AND STUFF. BUT DON'T WORRY, BECAUSE DAYVA'S GOING TO TAKE OVER FOR ME. - OH, WELL THAT'S GOOD NEWS ALL AROUND. YOU'LL BE RIGHT NEXT DOOR. CONGRATULATIONS. - MR. CAMPBELL. I HATE TO DISTURB YOUR PARTY, BUT I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU THAT WE ARRESTED OMAR FOR SETTING THE FIRE. - WHAT EVIDENCE? - WELL, WE HAVE A WITNESS. - WHO? - THAT MAN. HE BROUGHT HIM IN. - WHAT'S HIS NAME? - VICTOR HERNANDEZ. - OH...EXCUSE ME. - SURE. - YOU'RE EDGAR'S FATHER, AREN'T YOU? - HE DOESN'T KNOW ME. I WAS IN PRISON WHEN EDGAR WAS BORN. - WELL, WHY DON'T YOU COME ON OVER AND INTRODUCE YOURSELF TO EDGAR? - NO. I WILL WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT. THANK YOU FOR TEACHING HIM TO READ. - THANK YOU, FOR WHAT YOU DID. - THAT WAS MY PLEASURE. [door opens] - MR. CAMPBELL? WHAT DO YOU THINK? THANK YOU. WE HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU. - THIS GIFT IS FOR YOU, WILLIAM. IT'S FROM ALL OF US WHOSE LIVES YOU'VE TOUCHED. - [laughs] all: [laughing] - [laughs] THIS IS MAJOLI'S HANDPRINT AND EDGAR'S. [laughs] OH... MY WIFE WOULD HAVE LOVED THIS. HELEN CAMPBELL. WISH YOU COULD HAVE KNOWN HER. IT WAS HER LAST WISH THAT I COME DOWN HERE AND OPEN THIS READING ROOM, AND NOW I'M BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND WHY. SHE UNDERSTOOD WHAT I WOULD NEED AFTER SHE WAS GONE. A FAMILY. [laughs] all: [laughing] [applause] - [laughs] [kids yelling] - REVEREND. - BROTHER CAMPBELL. NICE DAY, ISN'T IT? YOUR TREES SEEM TO BE DOING WELL. THEY LOOK AS IF THEY MIGHT SURVIVE. WHAT DO YOU THINK? - I BELIEVE YOU'RE RIGHT. - HAVE A NICE AFTERNOON. - HEY, BOSS. WERE YOU TAKING THE DAY OFF? - NO, I'M TAKING THE WEEK OFF. - I'M SUPPOSED TO WATCH THIS PLACE ALONE? - HIRE SOMEBODY. WE CAN USE THE HELP. SOMEBODY CAN USE A SUMMER JOB. - BOSS, YOU WANT ME TO GET YOU A NEW ONE? - YEAH, ONE FOR THE WHOLE YEAR. AND GIVE YOURSELF A RAISE. [kids yelling and playing] all: [cheering] ♪
