Hold, hold, hold. Okay, go search, go search. Hey, sweetie. Good girl, Maxie. Come here, baby. Good girl. Wow, that is one talented dog. You must have a strong scent. You know, when you asked me to spend the morning with you, this is not what I had in mind. Well, you have the eternal gratitude of the entire Kenai Mountain Rescue Team. Why don't you show your gratitude by having a drink with me? It's seven in the morning. I don't mean like a drink drink. I mean like a coffee or a hot chocolate. Yeah, I would love to. Yeah? Great, then it's a date. Well, I got to get to the cafe. Gotta help my mom 'cause my sisters are actually coming in from New York for my mom's birthday. Another time then. I don't know. The locals might start talking if they knew that I was dating the guy renting my parents' guest house. Dating? I'm just talking about getting a drink, but if you want to date. You excited to see your sisters? Yeah, I am. It's also complicated. You're talking to an only child. Has it always been complicated? No, we were really close when we were little, but I don't know. Maybe it's normal for siblings to grow apart as they get older. It doesn't help that we live on other sides of the country. So what are they like? How to describe my sisters? And finally, I would suggest a line item accounting to ferret out any redundancies. To be competitive, you're going to need to streamline. That is, if you decide to bring your business to Crest Financial. Thank you for walking us through that, Hannah. We expect to make our decision in the next week. Very good. Just curious if you could share more of your longterm strategy? Well, that would be much more complex, but I would be happy to work out a more expanded analysis. I could get started on that right away. Well then, we'll look forward to reading it. Thank you for coming in. Are we celebrating a new account? Not sure, but I think we have a good shot. Still have work to do. Where is everyone? A bunch of folks cut out early to get drinks at O'Brien's for Charlie's birthday. Oh, that reminds me, did you- Checked you in for your flight to Anchorage, upgraded you to business class, and I got a car to pick you up when you land in Alaska. Great. Oh, and I need to get a gift for Suzanne. 60's a big year, it needs to be something special. You're getting excited to spend some time with your sisters? Yeah, it should be good. Speaking of, Beth called to see if you're meeting at her place or at the play. The play. Oh. You want me to get her on the phone? No, no, I better call her. Okay then, I'll see you when you get back. Call or text anytime. Okay, I will. Good afternoon, doctor's office. Is Dr. Vogel in? Who's calling, please? Hannah McBride calling. The line is busy, would you like his voicemail? No, no, just if you could have him give me a ring back, that would be great. As soon as possible. - You got it, bye now. - Bye-bye. - She isn't! - She is! Girls, girls. Melly. Okay, just... Hey, Hans, can you hold on just a sec? Melly, stop, please. If you pull the ears like that, you're going to rip it off. Thank you. Hi, sorry. That doesn't sound good. No, they're fighting over Bugsy again. Bugsy? Stuffed animal. Are you coming here or we going to meet you at the school? Listen, Beth, I hate to do this last minute, but it looks like I'm going to have to do a rain check for the play tonight. No, are you serious? They're going to be so disappointed. Melly's the lead, but this is Ruby's first play. I know, I know, but work's been so crazy. I just... I just flew in from San Francisco late last night and I'm trying to land this really big client. This is twice you've canceled on us this month. I know, I'm sorry. But I'm going to see you tomorrow. Okay, I'll make it up to the girls, I promise. I'll take them for the day. I mean, no offense, but they'll eat you alive. Besides, I'm not putting much stock in your promises these days. Look, I... I said I was sorry, I don't want to fight. I just want to get through this trip, okay? Just can we put everything aside for Suzanne? Can you not call her Suzanne? You do realize this birthday is the 25th anniversary of... Yeah, I know. This time of year, it's all I can think about. Gotta go. How's it coming, guys? We're almost there, right? It's so beautiful up here. Gosh, we don't get mountains like this in upstate New York. Yeah, we get a ton of clients from back east. They all say it's worth the trip. Fabulous way to spend your birthday, Suzanne. Yeah, I got it pretty good. So how long have you guys all known each other? The four of us went to Michigan together. Been friends ever since. Suzanne guided us on our first ever summit when we were sophomores. Wow. So you and your husband been doing this for a while? Yeah. I run people up and down the mountain. Stewart runs the business and our indoor climbing classes for kids. So, next section gets pretty steep. I'm going to need to put you on belay. Whatever you say, captain. Looks like we have some clouds moving in. There was snow up top early this morning, but the forecast said it should be clear by the time we get up there. What was that? Suzanne? Suzanne! Suzanne, are you okay? You drifted off. Yeah, I'm fine. What's up? Well, I'm headed home. Gotta sort the rooms for our special guests. I'm about done here too, I will join you. Great, I'll meet you out back. You're okay, right? Honey, I am fine. Will you quit worrying about me? Well, I just want to make sure that the birthday girl is happy. Sweetheart, my birthday is still a few days away. Please, don't rush me out of my fifties. Come on, 60 is the new 40. I heard 60 is the new 30. Yeah, well, I wish. Nope, 60 is still 60. And you are as beautiful and vibrant as the day I met you. Liar. It's true. So how was everything today, gentlemen? The service and the food was perfect, Suzanne, as always. Thank you. How about a dozen of these cookies for the Polar Bear Club? You got it. Keep the change. Here you go. Be sure to say hello to Hannah and Beth for me when they get in. We will. Having you girls together is all she's been talking about for months. Oh, don't I know it. Oh, okay. Your dad and I are headed home. Still need to get the house in order. Oh, and if you have time, the monthly invoices still need to be balanced. Right, got it. You know, there is this thing called software, just saying. Yeah, well, after we retire and you're running the cafe, you can do the invoices however you want. Until then... Abacus, parchment, paper, and quill? Very funny. Ha ha. You told her to let go. He was mine first. You did give him to Ruby. But I miss him, I want him back. Well, sweetie, that's not really how gift giving works. We could share. That's a really good idea, isn't it, Melly? Doesn't matter, he's ruined. One quick trip to the stuffed animal vet and he is good as new. Hmm? Hey girls, this is Mommy's old boss. You guys run upstairs quick, quick, quick because Daddy's going to be here any minute, okay? You start getting ready. Hello? Beth, how are you? I'm good. Good. Well, it's been a minute, so I thought I'd check in with my favorite former colleague. Yeah, wow, it has. It has been a minute. How, how are you? How's the company? We're both amazing. Both very busy. Beth, does the name Anna Bellingham ring a bell? Yeah, she's the CEO of Regal Beauty, right? Well, we just got out of a meeting with her and we were discussing marketing their new beauty line. That's huge. Congratulations. It's a little early for congratulations, which is where you come in. Okay. I thought to myself, who would be the perfect point person for this account? The great Beth McBride. Yeah. Maybe in my former life. Which makes you perfect for this. Their target demo is moms in the workforce or at home who want to look their best but don't have the luxury of time. I'm flattered, I am. But I just, I have a lot on my plate with the family, so. Don't you ever think about getting back to work? Wait, are you offering me a job? That's the plan. But first Anna wants to see a strategy on how we would reel in our target market. I... Thank you, but now's not great. Mull it over. I'll touch base in a day or two and you can give me your answer then. Okay, yeah, I'll think about it. Deal. Thanks, Corinna. I'm home! Daddy, Daddy! Hi, hi. Get in here. Oh, wow, look at you. Okay, what's happening? Melly broke Bugsy. I did not. Oh no. But looks like she's in good hands. - Can I have one? - Me too. Oh, okay. Those are supposed to be for after the show. Sorry. But at least I don't have to talk to you about cavities. Do I? Sorry. So, how was your day? Well, it was interesting. Care to elaborate? Later. All right. So, who wants to go to the theater? - Me! - Me! All right, let's go, let's go. Hand, hand, hand. Who's driving? You driving? Okay. Hey, should I bring this scarf? Hannah? Hannah? Yes, yeah, sorry. Yes? Scarf, should I bring the scarf? Sure. Yeah. The scarf. Everything all right? It's just, you know, this trip couldn't have come at a worse time, right? I think that I bit off more than I could chew with this account. Anything else? It's just I know that being with family can sometimes be stressful. Well, there is that. And Beth is mad at me. Again? Yeah. Well, look, it's only for a few days, so why don't we try and make the best of it? Promise? I promise. As long as you promise not to take the bait and get in another chess battle with my dad. Trust me, I'm not falling for that again. The man is a shark. Oh. Whoa, you okay? You look a little pale. No, I'm fine. I just skipped lunch. I'm going to pack, or repack. What'd you want to talk to me about? I know that it's not the best timing, but with the girls getting older, I think I'm ready to take on more. And I know this is something that we've talked about before, but I've been thinking a lot about it recently and it just, I feel like... Wow. I was not expecting this. I know the timing's not great. Oh, the timing is never perfect. I think it's a great idea. Oh, really? Yes, yes, we can adapt. Remember when we were planning to have Ruby, we thought two kids would do us in. You don't think the girls are going to feel like they're not enough? I don't want them to feel that way. Are you kidding? They're going to be thrilled to have a younger sister, or brother. Um... We're not talking about the same thing. No, we're not. We're not talking about the same thing, sorry. I... Corinna reached out to me. As in formerly the bane of your existence Corinna? She wants me to be the point person. And this is an amazing opportunity. Okay. And work was a huge part of my life. It was. And with Ruby going to preschool, I have more time. Okay, but when we had kids, you wanted to stay home. What made you change your mind? I... I just feel like you're the, you know, you get to go to work and you get to do what you love. And then you come home, you get the best part of them. You get to be the fun dad, and I'm just this, the person that says no all the time. I need balance. Mom! Stop it! Wait, hang on, let's finish this conversation. I can't. I gotta break up a fight and then I gotta sew an ear back on a stuffed animal. So just... Maybe you're just burnt out. What if tomorrow you head back home and the girls and I will stay back a day? Give you, I don't know, a little break? That would be nice. Hey, girls, girls, girls. Flight 662 to Chicago, urging passengers to proceed to gate B14 for immediate boarding. Can I bring either of you something to drink before your flight? Oh, champagne? I'll just have some water, bit of a headache. Thank you. Make that two. Hey, we've got a long flight. Maybe see if you can catch up on some sleep. Good idea. Fingers crossed we won't encounter any screaming kids. Got my eye on a potential troublemaker over there. Speaking of which, are you prepared to talk babies when your mom inevitably brings up the subject, she wants grandkids? You know, she has Melly and Ruby and who knows, one of these days Posy. It's not that uncommon for couples to decide not to have kids. Ladies and gentlemen, flight 783 to Anchorage, Alaska will begin pre-boarding in 10 minutes. Please make your way to the gate. I'll get those waters to go. Thanks. This is Dr. Vogel returning your call. I have your test results. Please give me a call back. Hannah, I had another bad dream, can you read to me? Sure. Come on. "It was a bright and sunny morning" "and the window stood wide open." I'm trying to sleep. Can we start at the beginning? Posy, if we keep starting at the beginning, we'll never get to the end. Mom and Dad would start over as many times as we wanted. I wish they were here. Me too. Okay. "There once was a velveteen rabbit" "and in the beginning he was really splendid." "He was fat and punchy as a rabbit should be." Hey, sorry. Hey, sis, welcome home! Thank you. Hey! Jason, the kids, getting their bags? Nope, just me flying solo. Wait, what? They'll be here tomorrow. I'm so confused, why didn't you say anything? I didn't want you to worry. You know, kind of like you're doing right now. I'm not worried. You know, it's just different. Well, Jason thought I could use some quality time with my sisters, so he's giving me some space. Details, please. Can we just talk about something else? Lots of women are mothers and have careers. Well, yeah. It's not selfish of me to want more. Did he say you were being selfish? No, he just can't understand why now. I mean, I love being a mother and a wife. I just, I want more. Yeah, okay. That's great. But yeah, why now? Talking to Corinna woke something up in me. I mean, I miss being out there with adults, you know, doing something that I'm good at that doesn't involve cleaning or making lunches. I miss the hustle. And let's be honest, I mean, the girls are gonna grow up, right? And they're going to be out of the house and then who's going to hire me? I mean, an 18 year gap tends to stick out on a resume. I mean, I'd be un-hireable. I think you're getting ahead of yourself here. And in Jason's defense, change is hard. Maybe he just likes things the way they are. Yeah, but he didn't seem to have a problem when he thought it was about having another baby. He said "We'll adjust, you know." Wait, you want another baby? No, that's not about having another baby. Oh, because you mentioned a baby. No. Wait, are we having one of those I should just listen conversations or you want my help conversations? Both. Okay. Well, to be honest, I'm pretty surprised that you're even thinking about working with Corinna again. I mean, you couldn't get away from her fast enough. People change. Everybody gets to do what they want in life. I mean, you get to spend time in the mountains and you'll have the cafe. And Hannah, you know, she leads her jet-setting life. And then there's me. You shouldn't compare yourself to others, you know. Things aren't always as simple as they seem. I'm just... I'm happy to be home. I'm excited to see Mom and Dad. They are so happy you're here. Does she ever talk about it, the accident? No. Talking about the accident is... It's not really our family's strong suit. What an awful thing to be reminded of every single birthday. I think this is the first time in five years that you, me, and Hannah have been home at the same time. Should be interesting. Really interesting. Oh, there they are! Welcome home, honey. Oh, oh, sweetheart. - Good to see you. Good to see you. Hello, kid. Dad. Oh, I'm so happy to be home. We've been counting the days. Yeah. Wait, where's Jason, the girls? Oh, slight change of plans. They'll be coming tomorrow. Oh, well, we'll just get your bags inside. We set up your old room for you. Thanks, Dad. So you must be exhausted. Do you need a hot shower or a warm cookie? Both. That's my girl. Posy, can you show your sister to her room? I think she knows which room, Mom. This brings me back. Did I ever tell you how much I miss your cooking? Well, I miss cooking for you more. You spoil us. Sometimes I get jealous that Posy gets to live next door. Seriously, I wish I was half the cook you were. I think Jason and the girls definitely agree. Oh, come on. I'm sure you're great. No. Well, all it takes is practice. Posy here used to want nothing to do with baking and she's turning into a real pro. Oh. That's quite a casserole. Yeah. Well, Hannah and Adam will be here soon and I wanted to take some to Luke too. Who's Luke? He's been renting the guest house the past few weeks. He's a travel writer. Oh, speak of the devil. Hey. Okay. You didn't want to tell me that there was a cute writer living on the property? It never occurred to me. Uh huh. And he is a very nice young man. In fact, he is writing a travel guide about the great peaks of North America. All of which I hope to summit one day. Actually, Mom, why don't you let Posy and I run this over to him? - Yeah. - I would like to meet Luke. You think this is funny. What a nice surprise. I hope we're not bothering you. You're not bothering me. Mom whipped up one of her specialties. Have you eaten? No. Oh, this is my nosy sister, Beth. I've heard a lot about you. New Jersey, married, two kids. That about sums it up. I have heard a lot about you too. Really? Yeah, Mom filled her in. Oh. You guys want to come in? We would love to. Except that we can't because our other sister is arriving any second. That'd be Hannah, right? - Yeah. - That's right. So how long will you be in town? I'm not really sure. I've got a few climbs I want to get under my belt and a few sights I'd like to see before I head back home to Chicago. He should come to the Lumberjack Games with us. We're going to the Lumberjack Games? Yeah, it's a family tradition. Okay, well, I'm sure Luke has work to do. Actually, one thing you should know about writers is we do just about anything to avoid writing. Well, it's a plan. All right, I look forward to it. Tell your mom thanks for the food. I will. Bye, Luke. Family tradition? Okay, I might've gotten carried away, but I feel bad, he's all by himself. You're just like Mom, always playing matchmaker. Posy! - Hey! - Hey! Hi! So good to see you. Hey. Beth. How was the flight? Oh, it was great. Except for the kid that was kicking my seat. Oh, it wasn't that bad. He was just being a typical kid. Here's the weary travelers! Oh, you made it! I'm so glad to see you. Hey, Adam, welcome. - Welcome home. Okay, let's get inside and we are going to go make some tea. Come on, girls. You have anything stronger? I may have a single malt scotch around here somewhere. Follow me. These are delicious. I am definitely quitting my diet while I'm here. Mom, I love your food. Mom, sit down, relax. Oh, it's just so good to have all my girls here again. It's a miracle we could do it with your busy schedules. Did you really think we'd miss your 60th birthday? Okay, note to everyone. No need to keep reiterating it's my 60th. Just say plain old birthday. How are things at the cafe? Oh, Posy here has just really taken over the reins. She's a natural. It's almost like Stewart and I don't even need to be there anymore. It gives us such peace of mind knowing that it is going to be in safe hands when we retire. Well, speaking of retiring, I think I'm going to go to bed. No? Yeah, me too. I'll be up just as soon as I beat your dad here. I have him cornered. Checkmate. - Seriously? - Every time. Don't be too hard on yourself. You've had a long flight. We'll play again when you're not so tired. Dad, you're making it worse. Well, I... Next time, sweetie. Let's go. Live to fight another day. - Yeah, good night. - See everybody tomorrow. - Night. - Nighty night. You know, I think I will turn in as well. I'm going to give Jason and the kids a call before I read a book and drift off to a peaceful uninterrupted slumber. I'll help you up. I'm fine. Sure, yeah. That'd be great. - Night, Mom, Dad. - Night, girls. Good night, girls. Just the thought of working at the cafe for the rest of my life scares me to death. I want to travel, I want adventure. I want to climb new peaks. I know, but it's beautiful here and the people are nice. And Mom and Dad have done so much for us. I mean, it's their dream to keep the cafe in the family. What is this? I don't think I've ever seen this before. Me either. I can't believe we still have a VHS player. It must've been Hannah's. I think that about does it. Let's go. Girls. What do you think, girls? You excited? Your first overnight hiking trip. Isn't it gonna be freezing? I'm starving. I need to go to the bathroom. As you can tell, they're all very excited. Mom sure was beautiful. Yeah. She sure was. No colds, no one gets colds on this trip. The same age as Melly and Ruby now. Yeah. Sometimes I do wonder how different life would be if Mom and Dad were alive. Me too. I also think about what it would've been like if Suzanne and Stewart hadn't taken us in. Yeah. So much for sleeping in. Sorry, I know it's early for you, but I'm just dying to get your answer. Corinna. Jason and I talked and we just don't think it's the right time for us. I think that's a mistake, Beth. This is a golden opportunity. Believe me, I know, but I'm going to have to pass. I appreciate you thinking of me for this though. Good morning. Hey, there's coffee if you want some. Where is everyone? Oh, Mom and Dad are at the cafe, Adam went into town, and not sure where Hannah is. Funny. So what's on the agenda for today? I'm actually going to go into town too. I wanted to get a few extra little things for Mom's birthday. You want to join? Sure. I'd love to. - Great. - Hannah, you want to come? I would really love to, but I have to get through this proposal. I'll catch up with you guys later. And miss a day out with your sisters? Don't make me feel bad. I didn't say anything. You don't have to. So just you and me then. Yeah, guess so. Have fun. We will. Hey, Beth, how about this? No. Pretty sure she would hate that. Oh well. Luke! Hi. Posy, look, it's Luke. Yeah, I can see that. I saw you guys through the window, I wanted to say hi. What are you up to? Oh, we're trying to find a little extra something for Mom's birthday. How about you? I was going to go to Keystone Canyon, get some climbs in. I hear there's some beautiful waterfalls up there. Oh yeah, some of my favorite routes are up that way. Why don't you guys come? Oh, that's more Posy's domain. You should go. Oh, we just got here. Yeah. Go, I can keep looking. And leave you all alone? Oh, you say that like it's a bad thing. Jason arrives with the kids today, so this might be the only, you know, me time I get. What do you say? Yeah, yeah, I'd love to. Great. - Bye, Beth. - Bye, Beth. This is beautiful. Yeah, this is home. Aren't you so lucky you got Denali right in your backyard? Yeah, but you get to climb all over the world. What's been your favorite so far? Matterhorn. I mean, it's not the tallest, but it's definitely a challenge. Yeah, man, I would love to climb in Switzerland or, gosh, anywhere in Europe. Well, someone of your skills, you definitely should. Yeah, I was thinking about going back there this summer. Could use a companion, like a climbing companion. Oh, I'd love to, but work. I mean, your parents would understand a little climbing excursion. My dad maybe, but my mom, I think she'd rather I took up something a little less dangerous, like scrapbooking. Over-protective, huh? Yeah. But I can understand. My birth parents and one other couple, they were killed in an avalanche on Denali years ago. I was four years old at the time. Sorry, Posy. That's an impossible situation to deal with. We're still dealing with it, each in our own way. Posy, I... Oh gosh, I don't mean to bring you down. No, what I want to say- Oh, you don't have to say anything, really. It's a lot to lay on someone. Most people don't know how to react, it's fine. We came here to hike, let's get to it. Well, I think they are great together. Well, they do have a lot in common. I say we stay out of her business. Oh, come on. You guys realize I'm standing right here? And I agree with Hannah. Thank you. We just want you to be happy, honey. Grandma, we made it! Oh, there's my two favorite girls! I missed you guys. My turn. Auntie Posy! We almost missed our plane. Well, I'm glad you didn't because I missed you. Come here. - Mommy! - Where is your Daddy? Freezing out there. Oh. Wow. I kind of didn't know what to pack, so I kind of packed everything. Yeah, good man. So, who is hungry? We had pretzels, two cookies, and a candy bar on the plane. Traitor. Well, let's get your coats off at least. Come on. I'm glad you're here. Me too. How was your flight? Well, we were a little slow getting out of the house, but we made it. That reminds me, actually, not all of us made it. Daddy lost Bugsy. - Oh no! - Daddy lost Bugsy. What? Yeah, Daddy lost Bugsy. Well, sweetie, he might be on the airplane. I'll call the airline. Hey, girls, you know what? I didn't get my hug. Who wants to hug Auntie Hannah? Aunt Hannah! Hi, sweetheart. Hello, you two. It's so good to see you girls again. Think we'll ever see Bugsy again? 'Course you will. Oh. I gotta get this. Be right back. Well, are you sure you're sure? 100% Congratulations, Hannah, you're going to be a mother. Oh, look! Hey, Socks. Wow. Can we ride her, Mommy? Not right now. I can walk 'em around really slowly. Maybe when you're a little bit older. But last year, you said wait until next year. It's already next year. I've got helmets. You know what, I'm going to have to say no. Hey, you know what? I bet you he would love it if you gave him a brush. Oh, that's a good idea. A brush. It's pretty safe, you know. I'd make sure they didn't fall. Why chance it? He's got a perfect record. Not one accident. I don't think anybody plans on getting hurt, Posy. That's why they call it an accident. Come on, you don't want them growing up being afraid of everything. Not everybody's a daredevil. Our parents were. Yep, and look what happened to them. You know, Mom worries about you when you go climbing. What, am I supposed to stop doing what I love just because it makes someone nervous? Well, it's not just someone. It must be nice to have your freedom. What freedom? I have my entire future mapped out for me. You and Hannah get to live the lives that you want while I'm stuck here, working at the cafe. You don't think Mom and Dad felt stuck? Do you think their plans involved raising three little girls? Sometimes you have to make sacrifices. We all do. Good job, girls. Nice and gentle. What is that? That's a snowman. I thought it was a turtle. Is he making fun of Pudgy? You named your snowman Pudgy? Well, it's definitely accurate. Gosh, I remember this like it was yesterday. - Let's see. - Look. These girls were best friends. Oh, it's my favorite picture of you girls. Look, they are at the fairy creek. They have fairies here? Oh, yes. You can't come all the way here and not go to fairy creek. Can we go? Please, please, please? - Please? Sure. But Auntie Posy would have to be the guide. I don't think I would remember how to get there. I would love to. Thanks. Dad's promised Paul Bunyan over here that we would go to the Lumberjack Games, so we're in for that. Oh yeah, we're in for that. And I gotta be honest, I'm very excited. Adam, you in, buddy? Sounds good to me. Hannah? Where's Hannah? I'll be back. Look at this blue hair. Hey. Everything all right? Yeah, I'm great. Why don't you come join us? Posy and Luke are going through old photo albums and I think I'm close to checkmating your dad, so... I'll be in, in a minute. Okay, what is it? It's just... It's just a headache really. No big deal. I just... You have working too hard. It's supposed to be a time to unwind. Yeah. Okay, listen, I have an idea. What if, after I wrap up this next case, you and I go on a real vacation? I don't know. Hear me out, hear me out. We'll go somewhere secluded. No kids. A small island, just you, me, and endless margaritas. I don't think a vacation is in our immediate future. Why? Adam, I- We're going to start charades. Do you guys want to play? Count us in, yes please. I can definitely beat your dad at charades. Okay. Sorry, I cut you off. What were you going to say? Um. I was just going to remind you not to get so competitive with my dad. Charades. First new message. Hi, Beth, it's Corinna again. Look, I know you're busy, but I emailed you the brief anyways. Just look at it. You don't want to look back years from now and regret not doing this. Call me. Beth, we're starting charades! Coming. This is where real fairies live? That's right, but they only come out when there's no people around. Do they have magic powers? Oh, absolutely. In fact, if you can find a little round stone, make a wish, toss it in the water, and your wish will come true. What'd you find? Can I wish for Bugsy to come home? I don't see why not. Let's get you one too. Okay, now I'm going to take you girls to the wishing spot. Oh yeah, okay. They come right over here. Okay, close your eyes and make a wish and throw it in the water. That's so good! It's gonna come true, good job! My wish, Mom, I made a wish! Good job, sweetie. Well, here we are on the magical bridge! Here we are. It seems way bigger back then. Yeah, well, we were just kids. Hey, you know what? We should recreate that photo. Oh, that's a great idea. I'll take it. Posy, give me your phone. Yours is way newer than mine. Now take a seat, Hannah in the middle. Oh, we don't have to actually sit on the ground. I think you'll live. Do we really have to sit on the ground? You're so pushy, come on. Squeeze in close. I just don't understand why you have to do that. Why I have to do what? Tell her to make a wish for Bugsy. Now she's going to be disappointed. Look on the bright side, at least your daughter's going- Girls! Hey, can we not do this now? Big smiles. Hannah, I think your arms were around your sisters. Hold on. - Beth. - Oh, oh! Sorry. You startled me. I didn't mean to interrupt you. We are leaving in five minutes. Okay. On your marks, get set! What are they doing, Grandpa? Well, this is the cross cut saw competition. The teams are racing each other to see who can cut through the logs the fastest. I want to show Luke the wood carving. I want to try my hand at a little speed chopping. What? Well, there's a lot to see here, so why don't we just split up and meet over the hot saw competition in about an hour? And we'll take Melly and Ruby over to the kids area. How about that? Good? Let's go. We'll go this way. Thanks for coming along. I'm sure you'd much rather be climbing. No way, miss this? I love this stuff. Plus, there's always time to go climbing. Oh, you are leaving next week. Unless of course you want to extend your trip? Is that an invitation? Maybe. What do you think about Luke and Posy? They seem pretty good together, from what little I've seen. They both love climbing. Shared interests are always good. Thank you. They're both adrenaline junkies. You used to be a bit like that. I think you're talking about someone else. Oh, come on. When we first met, you were into all sorts of things. It was you that talked me into going cliff jumping at the lake that summer. I blame you for my fear of heights. I was a different person back then. You know, I guess there was things that used to scare me that don't anymore. And then there are things that I thought would scare me, maybe to the point that I never wanted to do them, and I think now maybe I would like to. Okay, you lost me a little bit back there, but... But whichever Hannah this is and whatever scary thing you want to do or not do, I'm in. Thank you. Cheers. Come on, come on, you got it, you got it, yeah! What do you say, Mr. McBride? You want to give it a shot? Oh, do not challenge him 'cause he might just do it. No, but I have another challenge in mind. Oh no, now you've done it. What'd I do? Be afraid. Okay. What are we playing for? Playing for chili? Well, not just any chili. Loser has to eat the five alarm chili. Oh. You're on. No, no, no, Luke, listen. You don't have to, really. I'm feeling pretty good about this. Plus I got a cast iron stomach. Oh gosh. Come on, Luke, you got this. Go, Luke! Good, that was good. That was pretty good. All right, come on, Dad! What ever happened to "Come on, Luke?" I don't know, he's family. Iron stomach. Nice one, Dad. Did I ever tell you guys about the time- That you won the blue ribbon at the chili cook-off? And held the title for two years until Francis Miller won with what you thought was a stolen recipe. Yes. Dad, we got it. Oh man, I just love this. Mr. North's chili is always my favorite. How you doing over there, Luke? I'm going, I'm going. Luke, don't worry, mate, the first aid tents are right over there. Just in case. It's not bad. Oh man! This should be illegal, I think my tongue's going numb. Good, because you have to finish the whole bowl. Dad. I'm kidding, I'm just kidding. Are you crying? No, it's still burning. Hey, you just missed the guys. Oh yeah. I'm gonna meet up with them later. Beth and I promised the girls we'd make special cookies for grandma's birthday. That's sweet. Wow, somebody's phone is really blowing up. It's Beth's. She's still sleeping, I'll drop it off to her. Huh. Everything okay? Yeah, fine. Good morning. Where are the girls? Playing in the living room. Why didn't you tell me? I can explain this. I thought we put that behind us. You lied to me. I just sent a few ideas. Jason, wait. Hey. Where is everyone? There are a lot of us. Can you be more specific? Mom, Posy. Posy's heading to work. Mom's being pampered. It's just you here? Yes. Can you... Can you watch the girls for a little bit? Watch them do what? Oh my... I'm joking. Of course I will. What is going on, Beth? Jason's upset. I may have not told him something important. I think there's a word for that. No. No, I did not lie, okay? Okay. Maybe a little. Fine, go. I've got the girls, unless of course you think they're going to eat me alive. Go, Mom. Thank you, Hannah. Wow. Thanks for walking me to work. You didn't have to do that. I wanted to. How's the book coming? Good. I hit a bit of a snag. Oh, writer's block? Yeah, something like that. I'm sure it'll come back to ya. So how many rescues have you been a part of? Not too many since I started. Luckily nothing too serious. Must get a lot of satisfaction from it. Might sound crazy, but I feel like it brings me closer to my birth parents. Swear I can feel them with me sometimes. How does Suzanne feel about you doing this? I know you said that she's not crazy about your climbing, but I can imagine that'd be hard for her too, right? Sure she'd rather I didn't, though she'd never say it. It's normal. She just wants you to be safe. Yeah. It's more than that though. I didn't tell you the whole story. Suzanne was actually leading the expedition on the day that my parents died. Her and my mom were best friends. They were a little ways away from the summit and rocks triggered a slide and... Posy, sometimes it's no one's fault. Yeah, I know, that's what we keep trying to tell her. She won't hear it. So they were still in Michigan at the time? Yeah, yeah. They were just working here for the winter, working as guides. This is where my dad, I mean, Stewart's family is from. And so after they adopted us, they knew they needed help, so they moved here to be closer to family. And it worked out. They helped out with the cafe and his parents helped out with us. The cafe was in the family. Yeah, they were so happy when he took it over, and one day I will do the same. Well, thanks for the walk, Luke. You sure don't want to come inside? I can hook you up with our famous blueberry pie. Well, if you're going to twist my arm. There you go. Thank you. What do I owe you? Oh, it's on the house. Oh, in that case, I'll take three more of these to go. Don't press your luck. Actually, I would like to make a contribution to the mountain rescue fund, so could I get a dozen of those cookies? That I'll happily charge you for. Great. Oh, table three needs their check. Oh, hey, Posy. I wanted to say thank you for inviting me out with your family yesterday. I had a great time. Yeah, it was really fun. Everyone really likes you. Maybe we could do it again sometime. Yeah, I'd love that. - Great. - Yeah. But if people see us hanging out together, they might get the impression that we're dating. I don't worry about what other people think. I don't think I believe you. Believe me now? I told her I wasn't interested in taking the job, I promise. But the next thing you know, she's convinced me to take a stab at a marketing proposal. Convinced. More like manipulated. But Beth, we've always told each other everything. Why not this? I don't know, I guess I just wanted to know if I still have what it takes. Of course you still have what it takes. You're great at everything you do. I guess I just thought that maybe after all these years, I've lost it, you know? I mean, Jason, if you had to give up your career and be a stay-at-home dad, you would've felt the same way. When we decided to have kids, it was your decision to walk away. I know. If you really want to go back to work, even if it is for Corinna, I'll support you. We'll figure it out. You really think we can make this work? I do. I'm sorry. It's okay. By the way, who's watching the girls right now? Good job, girls. Your mom is going to be so impressed. Aunt Hannah? Mm-hm? Do you think Bugsy will ever find his way home? Sure. Did you ever lose someone you love more than anything? Yeah, I did, honey. I have to get this. We're going to have a little break, but don't eat the product. All right? Hello? Okay, sounds good. Oh, and heads up, they don't make them anymore, so you're going to have your work cut out for you. Tell you what, drop everything you're doing, make it a top priority. Sure, let me do some digging. Great. And Lexi, I know that I don't do a very good job of telling you this, but I really appreciate you. I know, but it's also nice to hear. All right, bye. Melly, Ruby! We're home. I'm a cookie. So how are my little cookie monsters? Oh, wow, I am so sorry. I only left them for like a minute. Hey, girls, let's go get cleaned up, come on. Okay. It only takes a second for them to get into things. Well, thank goodness it was something harmless like frosting. That's not the point, Hannah. What is your point? I asked you to watch them, not let them run wild while you took care of work. I said I was sorry. You know what? This is my fault. I should have known better. Hannah, what I mean- Oh, I know what you mean. Hannah. I only left them for like a minute. Yeah, not good. We were having so much fun. It was like I was the cool aunt for once. Well, let's be clear, I'm the cool aunt. Yeah, that's true. You know, Beth is right, I'm not made for kids. Well, then you and Adam are perfect for each other. You know, not everyone wants kids. I'm pregnant. That is exactly the reaction I had. I'm trying to picture you with a baby. Posy! Oh my gosh. You're going to be a great mom. I get to be an aunt again! Oh, congratulations. You? I mean... I mean, you did seem a little preoccupied, maybe a little bit distant. I mean, more so than normal. Sorry, that didn't come out right. What did Adam say? Well... Hannah. We weren't going to have children. This is something I made very clear before we got married. I know, but circumstances change. You have to trust that things are gonna work out. I have always loved that about you. You've loved what about me? You go with the flow. You're like water. I'm more like- A brick wall? Well, I might've said more like a rock. That works too. But yes. Posy, I don't know if I have what it takes to be a good mom. When we moved here after the accident, I was so terrified. Everything we'd ever known was gone. I'll never forget how comforting it was to have you as my big sister. Really? Yeah. And that's how you'll be as a mom. I'm just a little scared. Yeah. Sure. Hi. Hey. Welcome. Yes, sorry, I was knocking for a while and I just let myself in. - That's great. - Good. So one for the adults, one for the kids. And there was a package out front. That's for me. Checkmate! It looks like you're just in time to watch history be made. Thank you for these. I won. New chess master. Yeah! Thank you very much. Oh, please, no, it's no big deal. We all came running into the room and there was Posy, just standing on top of the refrigerator. What was she, about five years old? Her first official summit. You were like a little mountain goat, climbing everything in sight. Oh, it was like she had no fear. You know, one of my favorite memories of her as a kid is when we got snowed in at Christmas. Do you remember that? Right, okay. So it snowed three days straight and we couldn't leave the house. So Posy's coming down the stairs with a little toy shovel saying she's going to tunnel her way out. I believed her. We all did. That's been fun. Enough Posy stories. No, no, no, I love this kind of stuff. What's your favorite childhood memory? Easy. 10th birthday, my aunt gave me my first real tent. So I camped out in the backyard every night, but I pretended I was on Half Dome. I thought to myself, I could live like this. And you do. You live your dream. Been very lucky. Suzanne and I spent an anniversary bivouacked on Half Dome. What's bivouacked? Well, sometimes it takes more than one day to complete a climb, so you sleep hanging off the side of the rock. Why? My question exactly, Melly. You really did that, Grandma? Mm-hm. Your grandma was quite the mountaineer. Why don't you climb anymore? Oh, it was a long time ago. Yeah. Who's ready for her birthday cake? That sounds great! Great idea. - Beth, will you help me? - Yeah. So Luke, what's the next stop? Chicago. Promised my aunt I'd be back for the annual Whitaker family reunion. - Oh, that sounds nice. - Yeah. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday, dear Mom ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Yay! Happy 30th times two. It's perfect. Okay. Here we go. Thank you. Wait, Whitaker. Luke Whitaker. I knew you seemed familiar. Hannah, what are you talking about? A few months ago, I got some messages from a Luke Whitaker who wanted to know about the accident. Wait, I got those phone calls too. Was that you? What are you guys talking about? I can explain. Explain what? That's a new low. It's not that simple. See, we've had people chase this story before, but none of them have moved into the guest house. A lot of people die climbing. Why is our story so important to you? Okay, girls. We are going to go upstairs and get ready for bed. What about cake? Well, we are going to have cake after, I promise. Yeah, great idea. I was going to get ready for bed too so then later we can have some cake in our PJs. Okay. I'm not just some guy chasing a story. My real last name is Palmer. Cheryl and Brett Palmer? My parents were the other couple that died that day on Denali. A. Posy, if I could just explain- Excuse me. - Posy. - Honey, wait. Sit down, young man. I was going to tell her. It wasn't supposed to happen like this. I'll pack my things and be gone in the morning. I thought about you. All the time. I didn't have the courage to reach out. I couldn't face you. I understand. I just thought you'd be better off without me as a reminder. The woman who ruined your life. Luke, I'm so sorry. You don't need to apologize. It wasn't your fault and you didn't ruin my life. I've had an amazing life. I wanna hear. Everything. Hi, Colin, can we sit here? Of course. The McBride sisters, together again. What can I get you ladies? White wine, please. Bring the bottle. I'll just have a water, thanks. Coming right up. How could I be so gullible? It's not your fault. I really liked him. Oh. We don't know the whole story. Oh, come on, you can't be serious. Maybe he's looking for closure. I mean, if anyone can be sympathetic to what he's going through, it's us. No, no, no, I can't believe I'm hearing this. He lied to her. Okay, I admit I like this new side to you. Yeah, well, somebody hurts my little sister, I get angry. I'd do the same for you. Okay, I saw that. What? You don't think I'd stand up for you. I don't think you think about me much. Can we not argue? No, let's have it out right here, right now. So how's your evening going so far? Not now, Colin. Right. You know what? Hannah's right. I'm so tired of us all tiptoeing around everything. Why did we stop being honest with each other? Don't you think it's weird that we never talk about the accident? We don't talk about it because we are protecting Mom. But why? Why do you think everyone needs protecting? Mom, Melly, Ruby? Can we leave the girls out of this? I'm just saying that they'll never have a chance to skin their knees. A few bumps and bruises are good for kids. Says the woman with no kids. It's not that you're just overprotective. You catastrophize everything. I catastrophize everything because bad things do happen. Posy, they happen to us. Beth is right. It is so scary to bring a kid into the world that is so uncertain where parents could just be swept away like that. They need certainty and stability. Sorry, Hannah, I love you, I do, I just, I just don't think you know what's best for kids. Beth. I have lost count of how many times you have canceled on Melly and Ruby. Have you thought about how that makes them feel? It's just, I- Please don't say that you're busy. Do you want to know the truth? I love those girls, but I... What? What? It's just too hard. They remind me of you and Posy when... When Mom and Dad died. And you, I will never forget how afraid you were. And I wanted so badly to save you from pain, but I didn't know how. You did. You did. Yeah. I don't know what I would have done if I didn't have you to lean on. Hannah, you were just a kid too. That wasn't fair to you. I just, I never considered how hard that must've been for you. I'm sorry. Sounds a lot like motherhood. No matter how you felt, you were always there for us. That's why you'll make a great mom. Oh my... You're pregnant. I think she's blown a fuse. For the record, I'll still be the cool aunt. I've made a career writing travel guides related to climbing. But I decided that I wanted to shift gears and write about something different. So I set out to write a survival book, not just for climbers that survived accidents, but for the people that were left behind by climbers that weren't so lucky. People like you all. Like Hannah, Beth, and Posy. People like myself. I thought it might bring some closure. We could all use some closure. I don't blame you, Suzanne. After all the research that I've done about that day, nothing points to anything other than a random act of nature. There are always signs. Yes, but my parents chose to go up there that day. As climbers, we know there are always risks and we calculate those risks. And it's not my place to say this, but it seems to me like the best way to honor my parents is for you to forgive yourself. Thank you. Oh, I swear, this woman never sleeps. She's constantly calling me, texting me. Hannah, what are you doing? You're going to get me fired. She can't fire you if she hasn't hired you. She is using you. Beth, if you want to go back to work, that's great. There are plenty of places that would be lucky to have you, places that won't make you miserable like working with Corinna. I know, but it's been seven years, I wouldn't even know where to start, Hannah. Well, I'll help you if you'll let me. Okay, but only if you let me help you with the baby. Count on it. Bye, Corinna. Bye. I feel good. Congratulations, you are free. Okay, now that we've dealt with that, let's deal with you. Oh, I'm good. My life is here, I'm cool with that. No, no. You deserve to be happy. What about everything you said before about sacrifice? I was wrong. I'm sorry if I made you feel like Mom and Dad's happiness was your responsibility. Shouldn't live your life according to what someone else wants. They've done so much for us. Yeah. But you should pursue your passion. And if that means venturing out, then so be it. Mom and Dad will understand. Can we make this a tradition? Every year, the McBride sisters get together and really be honest about their lives? I'd really like that. Me too. I really love you guys. Is it safe? Yes, Colin. I'll take it, I'll take it. All right. Little sis, paying the bill. - Thanks, Posy. - Thanks, Posy. There's still one more thing you need to take care of. What are you going to do about Luke? Oh. Hey, Mom. Hey, are you okay? Yes, I'm so sorry I ran out. You didn't get to do your presents or your cake or anything. The girls got into the cake, so we all just joined in. Can I get you girls some? - I'm okay. - I'm okay. I'm going to go tuck the girls in. I love you. I'll see you upstairs, hon. Yeah, sure. - Night, Mom. - Night, sweetie. - Girls. - Night, Dad. Okay, come here. So Luke and I had a really good talk. We talked about the accident. Mom. I can't tell you what a relief it is knowing he doesn't blame me. It's like I can finally see through this cloud that's been hanging over my head for the past 25 years. Mom, that's so much to carry around. I think Luke is the best birthday gift I could have asked for. We also talked about you. Now, I'm not playing matchmaker, but I know his feelings for you are genuine. Just I don't know how I could ever trust him again. Forgiveness is a good start. You seem made for each other. I've never seen two people who loved the mountains more than you do. It's your calling. Look at me. The cafe will survive, honey. But you and Dad, you have plans to retire. If there's one thing I've learned for sure, it's plans change. You need to follow your heart, Posy. And if that leads you to the peaks of Europe, then so be it. Yeah, but you and Dad, you guys didn't get a chance to have that freedom. You need to understand something. Our lives have been so much richer because of you. Sometimes you find your calling, but sometimes your calling finds you. Raising you girls was ours. Thank you. I was thinking. I could talk to Paul about working from home a couple of days a week. He's a reasonable guy. Don't hate me, but I have decided not to go back to work for Corinna. Oh. I think I'm going to wait for something that's a better fit. And Hannah has said she'd helped me find something. Oh, wow. Why the change of heart? What started as excitement, I don't know, turned into anxiety. Started to remember why I was happy to leave there in the first place. Good. But I think I'm going to try and work from home a couple of days anyway. I mean, the girls aren't going to be young forever and I'd like to be around more. I'd like that. Hey, how's Posy? Oh, she'll be fine. She's tough. You know, we talked. Like really talked, and having it out with those two was like, it was like getting a gift I didn't know I needed. Yeah, those are the best kind. I'm pregnant, Adam. I'm going to be a dad? Yeah, you're not disappointed? Disappointed, what, that we're going to have a family? I couldn't be happier. I don't know, we always said we weren't going to have kids. Yeah, well, things change. They're gonna change a lot. You're not worried? Hey, do I look worried? Little bit. Do I? Little bit? I love you. I love you. The end. One more? And then you promise you'll go to bed? Okay, go pick one. What do we have here? Oh, yes. Do you know that Hannah used to read this to Posy and me when we were your age? Hey, I just wanted to say good night. Will you read with us? Is there room? Get in here. Wow, you're still up. Yeah, we're just about to read our favorite bedtime story. Come on, we'll make room. I would love to, but girls, there was somebody that was just sitting in the hall. The fairies heard our wishes! They sure did. Thank you. Of course. You mind? Do I mind? All right, girls. You ready? Yeah. Okay. "There was once a velveteen rabbit" "and in the beginning he was really splendid." "He was fat and punchy as a rabbit should be." Hey. I didn't think I'd see you again. Yeah, well, my mom said something last night about forgiveness and I put myself in your shoes and it turns out they feel a lot like my shoes. Guess we share a tragedy. Yeah. I'm really sorry you lost your parents, Luke. You had every right to be upset. Luke, I have to ask, if I hadn't found out, were you ever going to tell me? My intention was to research the accident for the book, but then everything changed. I fell in love with this place. The mountains, your family. I fell in love with you. Every time I worked up the courage to tell you, I would talk myself out of it because I didn't want to risk ruining our relationship. I'm sorry. I don't blame you if you never want to talk to me again. I accept your apology. Hey, I have to get back to the house. Call it Mom's birthday 2.0. Do you want to join? Are you sure? Say yes before I change my mind. Yes. One, two, three, open your eyes! Surprise! Come here, we have a chair for you. Sit down, sit down, here you go. So since last night got cut a little short, we thought we would try this again. You guys. This is from me, Beth, and Hannah. Oh, girls, you spoil me. Oh. I love it. It's going on the mantle. Look, honey. Thank you. Okay, Adam and I have a little something for you. Actually, it's for both of you. Okay. "Dear Mom, surprise!" "Baby on the way." Are you kidding me? Oh, honey! Are they crying? These are happy tears, honey. We're going to be grandparents again. Your Auntie Hannah is having a baby. You and Ruby are going to have a little cousin soon. Congratulations on becoming an aunt, again. Thanks. Thanks for coming in here and disrupting our lives. If the offer still stands, I would love to go to Switzerland with you. Nothing would make me happier. All right, I would like to propose a toast. To family. Even the ones who aren't with us who we miss every day. Michelle and Jerry gave us the gift of a lifetime. You three beautiful girls. Thank you. Cheers! Cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers. Cheers, Grandpa. - Let's hug it out. - Okay. Get over here, girls! Oh. Happy birthday, Mom. I love you girls. ♪ Here's to the good times ♪ ♪ Forget the bad times ♪ ♪ These are the best days of our lives ♪
