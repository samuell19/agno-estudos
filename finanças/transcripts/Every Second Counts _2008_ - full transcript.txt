( male announcer) Good afternoon ladies and gentleman. and welcome to the Silverdale Valley Rodeo, home of the best penning in the west. We've got 30 head of cattle in the ring, all numbered zero thru nine. Three-zero, three-one, three-two, etcetera. Each team of three riders has to separate the same three number of cattle, and drive them into this pen over at this end of the ring. If a team puts more than four cattle over the foul line, they're out. The team with the fastest time wins. Tom Ward's down the side of the pen with the second number four cow, and it's in. Cows are frisky today, folks. All it takes is three. Tom, we are rooting for you. He's got the last one in. Will he beat his Albuquerque time? Yes! Three in the pen! Fast time! [applause] How you feeling? Feeling like a winner. How you thinking? Thinking like a winner. That's my girl. Better get out there. Rick and Ken are waiting. You ready, Ginger? [neigh] Go get 'em. Make me proud. Ready to take a short ride? Shorter than 49.26 seconds. I know it's gonna be tough to beat. [indistinct male voice over speakers] Next up, team four from Silverdale, Washington. Ken Bradshaw, Rick McCalrey, Brooke Preston. (whistles) Go Brooke! So what do you guys think? Odds or evens? Evens. I'm calling odds. Feel like a winner, think like a winner. [moo] Flag's up. [indistinct conversation between men and Brooke] (male announcer) Brooke Preston, wasting no time drives them back into the pen, cutting up that first seven. And Preston drives it in. And she's on a roll, cutting up the second seven. Bradshaw down the side with the third. That's fast time ! [applause] Yeah ! Ha ha! What happened back there? I don't know. She started favoring one leg to the end. Come on, Ginger. [guitar playing] [door creaks] (Dad) Hey, 47 seconds! Better face it, Helen, our kid is a champ. look at this. Oh, look at that ! Congratulations, sweetheart ! Wah ! Thanks, Mom. You shoulda seen her. Nobody could believe she's not 1 8 yet. She's going to the top. Yeah, our Brooke can do whatever she puts her mind to. I'm just gonna go make sure Ginger's okay. She started favoring one leg towards the end. Hi. Hey there. Miss me? Yeah. Easy, girl. How are you doing? [soft neigh] It's okay. [soft neigh] [loud neigh] That hurt? [soft neigh] It's okay. It's okay. [soft snort] [patting] Good girl. [whinny] [soft snort] Did you pay the gas bill? Yeah, sure. Well, we have no gas. When I called them, they said we owed them money. Oh, I bet I know what happened. I took a little extra out of checking last week so Brooke and me'd have some cash on the road. And I bet the gas check bounced. Hm... Don't worry, I'll call and fix it. You'd better. I will. Just for a couple of weeks, I promise. I'll pay you back by the end of the month. No problem. Come on, Jerry. Aw, thanks, you're a lifesaver. I'll see you at the garage. Bye. [sighs] What's with the cold shower this morning? (Dad) The gas company screwed up. Besides, that's the best way to start your day. It wakes everything up. I was awake. (Brooke) It's so beautiful. Kinda makes you feel small, doesn't it? Your granddaddy used to say, '' if you never knew small, you'd never know big. '' I'm not sure I should tell you this but... when I was about your age, I sorta ran away. Really? I just couldn't take that whole sad, small town thing, I just wanted to go my own way but after a couple of days, I came across the remains of this old campsite. You know whose it was? No. Mine. I'd just been riding in circles. I hadn't decided on a direction. So I was just going around covering the same territory. I found my way home, I felt pretty good about that but my daddy took that horse away for a month. When I got him back, that's when I became a competitor. And you were a good one. I was. Anyways, that's why I like the road. if you choose a destination, you'll always find a road to get you there. ( Dutch ) Joe Preston? What are you doing here? Competin'. No kidding? I didn't think you'd ever come back to Olympia. Well--here I am. You were lucky you just busted your leg that day instead of getting yourself killed. How long you been back in the saddle? It's not me, it's my daughter, Brooke. Little Brooke Preston? [chuckles] You can't be 18 yet. Seventeen. Brooke's been competing at the adult level for a few months now. Brooke, you remember Mr. Wilcox, don't you? Please, Dutch. You and Dad used to compete together. Your daddy was the best penner I ever saw. Long time ago. Hey, good luck today. You should stop by my place some time, Joe. The whole country is thirsty for oil, and I got a whole new generation of drills ready to give it to them. You wouldn't recognize the equipment now. I don't work oil rigs no more. [bell rings] We'd better go. Well listen, don't be a stranger, Joe. I mean it. You hear. And Brooke, if you ever want to take one of my champions out for a ride, you just let me know. Thanks. Hello, boys. That was nice of him. He can afford to be nice. Alright. ( Dad) How you feeling? Feeling like a winner. How you thinking? Thinking like a winner. That's my girl. Make me proud. ( Brooke ) Hey, guys. ( male voice ) Hey, Brooke. (Dad) Go get 'em ! ( male announcer) Three in the pen ! Fast time ! ( Dutch ) Yes ! Alright ! It's okay, girl. We're up next. What's up with Ging? Seems a bit twitchy. She's okay. We're up, guys. ( announcer) Next up, Brooke Preston, Ken Bradshaw, Rick McCalrey. ( announcer ) Flag's up ! [bell rings] [indistinct shouting in pen and announcer] [country music, lyrics indistinct] [high-pitched whinny] [high-pitched whinny] [gasp] ( announcer ) Rider down ! Rider down ! Brooke Preston, thrown from her horse ! [high-pitched whinny] Ginger! [high-pitched whinny] What happened? She's hurt, Dad. Are you sure it's not just a spasm? Maybe she just needs to rest it. She's in pain ! She can't compete ! Come on, girl. There's heat on her leg and if you look, there's a strong pulse in that thing by her tendon. Don't know why you called me, Joey. You got yourself a vet right here. Any indication that she been injured before? She's been favoring one leg for the past few weeks but, that's it. Well, I think she's got a suspensor injury. A torn ligament? Right, but even if she walked, it's not completely torn so, my guess is that there was some slight initial trauma, and the stress of competing has just made it worse. So we rest her for a couple of days and we're back on the circuit next week? It's a serious injury. This could take months. And even then, only if you work on a specialized training program but even that's no guarantee. I could email you a training program. Call me if you have any questions. There's gotta be something we can do. I mean, this is our shot. ( Vet ) Well, you can get a second opinion, ( Vet ) but a tear is a tear, that's the reality of it. ( Vet ) Except turn back the clock all you can do is wait. ( Vet) The circuit will always be there. Yeah, right. ( Dad ) What do I owe you? ( Vet ) That's 200. [soft snorting] [weeping] I'm sorry. [engine starts] ( Brooke ) I'm so sorry, girl. I should've known. [gentle snorting] Hey. Are you okay? No. Not really. I knew that there was something wrong. I shouldn't have taken her into the ring. Oh, sweetie. If I hadn't ridden her and called the vet sooner, she wouldn't be hurting so bad. And I actually thought that l'd make a good vet. Oh, darling. You're too hard on yourself. There's no way you could've known. Hm? I know it costs a fortune. But I've been talking with the counselor at school and she says there are scholarships I qualify for. If keep my grades up. I figured, why not apply? Yeah, well if you want to be a vet, we're gonna make it happen. I don't know. I haven't made much of a start. You know, this actually might be a good thing. Look at it as taking a break. You won't be competing, so you'll have time to go look at some colleges, if that's what you want. Oh, Ginger is gonna be okay, sweetie. As long as she takes it easy. The competition is always gonna be there. I just feel like I'm letting everybody down. Don't be so dramatic. Huh? legs, hearts, everything heals. You have gifts, Brooke. And not just for riding. Hey, Caden. Hey. Will we see you at the party on Saturday? I haven't decided yet. Maybe. Brooke ! Hey ! Here you go. Here's the application information you wanted. Thanks, Miss Alcott. There's a couple of great options in there. But, have a look and then come and see me, okay? Okay. Mr. Randall ! Here's someone else I think should come in for a visit. We have to talk about biology. I just don't care what cytokinesis is. Well, you need tutoring. Brooke here is a biology whiz. Too bad she's not a tutor. Come and see me by Friday. Yes, ma'am. Hey. Would you? Would I what? Tutor me. Oh, she was just kidding. I can't teach biology. And I can't learn it, so we're even. Could you just help me out for the test next week? Okay. Maybe some time this week, I guess. Yeah. That'd be great. How about Thursday in the library? Sure, Thursday. if that's good for you, it's good for me. See you then. Okay, see yah. Thank you. What are you doing? Well, trying to get this checkbook to balance but it doesn't want to. You know, she's really good, and she's got a real shot, and I-- I gotta get her riding again. It'll all work out. Frank, you got a minute? What's up? Just wondering if you could help me out. I could use a little advance on the paycheck. Just a couple hundred oughta do it. See, I was counting on the, uh-- Joe, I don't need to hear it. You know I'm good for it. Look. I'm gonna help you as a friend. You're a good mechanic, everyone here respects that. But you haven't been holding up your end. Some of the guys have been complaining. It's gotta stop. I'm serious. ( Brooke ) Okay. So, again, which form of cell signaling occurs when the target cell is alongside the signaling cell? Um, notch--no? Paracrine Notch-signaling is where two cells make physical contact in order to communicate. Oh, so--they have to kiss. If that will help you remember, that's one way to look at it. Okay, so notch, kiss. Yeah. I can remember that. Hey, you know it's kinda weird being in here when it's empty. Wanna go somewhere else? l've got my truck. We only have autocrine signals left. Okay, we can talk about them in my ''auto-mobile. '' Come on. Do you take all the girls here? Nope. You're the first. Look at that. Who needs biology when you have that? [bird chirps] You know this time of the day used to be my favorite. I'd take my horse to a field like this and-- we'd gallop straight at the sun. Just like we were gonna kick it into deep space. Who would've thought the two of us would be sitting here? Why? Well, you're this penning star and I throw the second meanest screen pass in the district. Did you always want to pen? I don't know, it's not something I've ever really thought about. It's just something I always did. Yeah, it's kinda like me and football. If it wasn't for that, there's no way I'd go to college. You're going to college? Partial scholarship at CW. I'm redshirting. What's redshirting? That's when you're on the team but you don't get to play the first year. So you do all the work and you never get to play. Yeah. My coach says he likes my arm but I lack size. Wants me to eat egg whites or something. You're lucky. Me? You're the one who's going to college! I mean, you're smart. You don't have to do something to be special. You just are. Come on. How come nobody at school knows you? What do you mean? Well like, they know who you are, they see you in class, sure, but you don't belong to any clubs, you don't talk to anybody. You don't go to dances or parties. Penning takes up most of my time. If I'm not competing, I'm practicing so that doesn't allow a lot of time for partying. Do you ever wish you were just like other girls? You mean like the girls that flirt with you in the halls? Okay, they flirt with every guy in the school. Yeah, but you flirt back. Yeah but it doesn't mean anything. I'm just trying to be friendly. What are you doing? Um, notch signaling? I'm not like those other girls. No. You're not. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. Um, so are we still friends? Sure. Friends. ( Dutch ) Joe ! Hey, Dutch. I don't see you in years, then I see you twice in one month. What are the chances of that? How's that little girl of yours doing on the circuit? We're kinda restin' for a while. Sorry to hear that. She's got talent, shouldn't let her get rusty. Well, that's why I'm here. See, we're out of the game right now because that vet won't let her horse pen. Might be for a few months, might be forever, so-- I was thinkin', I can get some money together but, maybe not enough for the kind of horse that Brooke needs. So you're looking to make a deal? Yeah. [bell ringing] Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey. Hey. Sorry about your test. Guess I'm not a very good tutor. Are you kidding? C +? That's the best I've gotten all year. I'm not gonna rest until I get that B-. Oh, there's a party up at Terry Lynn's place this weekend. You should come with me. I can't. I've got to work on Ginger's rehabilitation. What? You can't take a few hours off? Come on, there's gonna be swimming, dancing-- I--I don't know how to dance. Really? Are you serious? Is that so surprising? No, I thought every girl knew how to dance. Okay, I'll tell you what. if you come with me, I'll show how. No, I can't. I'm sorry, really. Well at least let me give you a ride home. Come on, I'm not taking no for an answer. Come on. ( Caden ) I jus gotta get some flour for my mom. ( Brooke ) Let's go to Hilltop Variety. Why? We're right here. My mom works here. Why, you think I'm not gonna like you because your mom works here? [country music and bell jingles at door] Hi, Mom ! Hi, honey. This is a nice surprise. This is my friend, Caden. Hello, Caden. Hi. Nice to meet you, ma'am. Caden and I, we're in the same class. I'm helping him with some schoolwork. Oh, really? She's a lot of help. I'm glad to hear that. Say Caden, maybe you'd like to join us for dinner, seeing as how you're gonna be out there already. Yeah, sure that'd be awesome. I'll just give my folks a call. Okay. Drive safe. Yeah. it was nice meeting you, ma'am. Okay. The flour. Oh, yeah ! Is that your dad? That's my dad and my grandpa. He was a champion bull-rider. Wow! That's a lot to live up to. Tell me about it. Yeah, my father said he saw your dad at the penning state finals. He says he was fast as lightning. What happened to him? He had an accident. Completely shattered his leg and ended his career. Then he met my Mom and settled down. So what's that? It's his lucky silver dollar. It was part of the prize he won at his first penning contest. He was 15. He put it on a chain and he's worn it ever since. You know, people are talking. Yeah? What are they saying? They're saying, you're gonna be even better at penning than your father was. I can't think about that. I've got to take care of Ginger. Isn't that right, girl? [soft snort] That a girl. Guess she likes you. [chuckles] She's a beautiful horse. The two of you together must be quite the sight. She probably needs brushing. Can I try? Sure. Careful not to go against the hair. [soft snort] Here. like this. [soft snort] Nice. That's it. Gentle. You're not just flirting? ( Dad ) Brooke ! You home? Yeah, Dad, I'm in here. This is Caden, a friend from school. Hi, nice to meet you, Mr. Preston. Caden, good to meet you. Come on, I got a surprise for you. [strong neighing] ( Dad) Alright there, now, easy. Easy. Easy. Easy does it now. [loud neigh] Hey ! Hey ! Come on, now. Come on ! He's beautiful, Who's is he? Well, you need a horse, don't you? So I got you one. Where'd this horse come from? Dad got him for me. He did? Yep. And he's a beaut. [loud snorts] What's his name? Ghost. Hey, boy. Get that name for a reason? Brooke, why don't you get that horse put away in the stable. I'll have dinner ready in 20 minutes. Forget dinner. We got work to do. This horse is out of training. Helena is less than two weeks away. Joe, we have a guest for dinner tonight. That's okay, Mrs. Preston, I should get going anyway. Um, I'll see you at school tomorrow. Nice meeting you guys. Just keep dinner warm for us. Brooke and I will be in later. Joe? We have to talk later. I'm sorry. I had no idea. No, that's okay. It's a big deal, your dad just bought you a horse. Besides we have lots of time to make up for dinner. Right. I'll see you at school. Okay. See you. [loud whinny] [loud whinny] Okay, yeah, alright. ( Brooke ) Easy, boy. [whispers] Yeah, alright. ( Dad ) Get on? Yeah. Are you out of your mind, Joe? We can't afford a new horse. Helen, I got it covered. Everything around here is falling apart. My car is on its last legs. The barn leaks every time it rains. We have no money to fix anything. You think I don't know we're in a cash crunch? Listen don't go telling me, that Brooke is gonna win enough money to pay for it all, because if I have to pull extra shifts at the Tempo so my daughter can get an education, that's what I'll do but I am not gonna break my back so that you can throw our money away. With all due respect, Brooke can make more in one afternoon competing than you or I can in a month. She wants to go to college, Joe. She can't do both. She's going to college. She may have to delay it for a year or two 'cause money won't be a problem then. But she's Just a child. She shouldn't have that kind of responsibility dumped on her. The important thing right now is that she start her life out now as a winner. People recognize winners. They respect them. And then, she'll do anything she wants, and she'll have that attitude that you need to succeed. That's what I'm gonna give her. That's all I can give her. It's worth more than any amount of money. How much did that horse cost? Nothing. Nothing? Dutch loaned him to me. He was penning with him till a year ago when they got a younger horse. The deal is Brooke brings him back to where he was and later we'll see if we can buy him or we could send him back when Ginger's back on her feet. You went and saw Dutch? Yeah. He must have retired the horse for a reason. He's probably too old to compete. He's a little long in the tooth, but that don't mean he can't compete. That horse right out there, is a winner. You'll see. We're gonna make him a winner. [sigh] Well I hope you're right, Joe. 'Cause if you're not-- I just hope you've done the right thing. Alright, Ghost, If this is gonna work out, you're gonna have to trust me. You ready? [snorting] Go, easy Ghost. Whoa! Settle down. Easy, easy. It's okay. Calm down, Ghost. [loud neighing] Shh. Ohh. Easy. You're not gonna get rid of me that easy. Come on. [loud neighing] Easy. [snorts] Calm? Now I want you to show me what you've got. ( upbeat music ) ( upbeat music ) ( upbeat music ) ( upbeat music ) Easy. Easy now. [engine backfires] Easy, Ghost, whoa. Easy! [whinny] [whinny] That backfire spook him? Yeah, he's okay, though. He's a handful. He's magnificent. Come on boy, let's get you some breakfast. Go on. ( Mr. Coleman ) So, a receptor is ( Mr. Coleman ) a protein on the cell membrane ( Mr. Coleman ) that binds to specific molecules. ( Mr. Coleman ) Receptors recognize neurotransmitters, hormones, ( Mr. Coleman ) and they initiate the cellular response to what? Brooke? See me after class. [bell rings] You wanted to see me? Yes, Miss Alcott tells me you're thinking of Washington State? I applied but I don't know, it's so expensive. Class of '82. If you want to go for a scholarship, you may want to think about doing an extra credit project, like a research paper, something like that. I'd be more than willing to help you. Thanks. I'd like that a lot. Good. So I want you to think about a good subject, and we'll talk about it later. Thank you, Mr. Coleman. ( Caden ) How about we make a deal? You come to one of my games, and I'll go watch you compete. Deal? Deal. Hey, you in a hurry or anything? I was just wondering if you wanted to go for a drive? I better not. I gotta start working with Ghost. Come on, we could get like a quick burger. It'll be fast, I promise. I really can't. We've got Helena next week and--it's really important. Alright. Then--I'll just drive you home. Yeah ! That's my girl ! Yeah ! [lyrics indistinct] [shouting] [plucking] So we got Spokane, Boise, Salt Lake, Cheyenne, Sacramento, and then we qualify for the finals in Denver. Our daughter's good. Did Brooke mention anything to you about an extra credit project at school? No, but then she doesn't talk much usually about school. Her biology teacher, Mr. Coleman, he came into the store the other day and we got to talking. He thinks that if she does this project, it might help her qualify for scholarship money. Sounds good, I guess. As long as it doesn't take too much time. Well, Joe, you know-- Mom, did Caden call while I was gone? Uh, no, sweetie, he didn't. So why didn't you tell us about this extra credit project you got for school? I haven't really thought of one yet. Oh. I got an idea. What if you did something on you and Ghost? Communicating with a different species. Something like that. It's not a bad idea. It's not a bad idea! ( Dad ) Did you hear what our daughter just said? My daughter Just said that I had an idea that wasn't bad. It's a miracle! if you need any help with it, you just holler, okay? Mm-hm. Play us a song, Mama. A song. Yeah, come on, play us a song. Play a song. Play a sone. What song? Oh, pay us the Hilltop song. Okay. ♪ I was standing alone on a hilltop ♪ ♪ I was waiting ♪ ♪ And wasting my days ♪ That's my very own Patsy Kline. ♪ You came along ♪ ♪ Now we're singing ♪ ♪ Together always ♪ ♪ No more waiting ♪ ♪ No more wasting days ♪ ♪ No more hilltops for me ♪ ♪ We found each other Standing alone ♪ ♪ Now we're singing Together always ♪ ♪ Always ♪ Dad, I can't dance. Oh come on, anyone can dance. I can't. She doesn't want to dance, Joe. How about you? You wanna dance with me? Oh, I guess I could. [Mom hums] How do you get prettier every year? How do your teeth not rot and fall out from all that sweet talk? I don't know. ( Frank ) Joel, come in here for a minute? (Joe ) Yeah, I'll be right there. Yeah? Yeah, come in. Shut the door. What's up? The engine flush you did on the Fitzgerald rig this morning. That guy, he is such a pain. When you finished, did you put oil back in the engine? He got ten miles and the engine melted. If we don't get him a new one, he's gonna sue our pants off. Geez, Frank, I'm sorry. Joe, your mind always seems to be somewhere else. You don't seem to be interested in this job anymore. I need to count on the people that work for me. You take some money out of my paycheck every week. You miss so many days your paycheck is down to almost nothing. Look, I can't carry you any longer. I'll make it up to you. Joe--I need a mechanic, not a penner. I'm sorry. I'm gonna have to get somebody new. Yeah? Yeah. I appreciate all the breaks you've given me. Okay. [indistinct yelling] ( Mom ) Brooke. Are you still awake? You gotta be on the road in four hours. I know, I just gotta get some of this work done. Are you sure you're up for this competition? You don't have to do it if you're not feeling well. The entry fee has already been paid. Well, that's not important. You have been overstressed and tired for weeks. This can't go on. It's just for a little while longer. Until I get caught up on my schoolwork. Have you talked to your Dad about college yet? No. Well, I know you don't want to disappoint him, but-- this is your life. You gotta tell him what's important. I wanna win for him, Mom. Honey, if you never get back on a horse again, and you will still be a winner in our eyes. Your father thinks you hung the moon, and that has nothing to do with a horse. Do you really believe that? Believe it? I know it! Let's get some rest. Come on. Thank you. [sigh] You sure you don't want any? I'm sure. I just wanna finish this and get some sleep. We'll just take the check then, sweetheart. Oh. Got your cut of your first prize money. Already gave Rick and Ken theirs. You could use a new saddle, and, uh, I think I know where I could go get us a deal. Actually, I was thinking of saving this. Oh, okay. Whatever you want. For school. School ? Yeah. Um, I've been meaning to tell you. I'm applying to Washington State. And if I get in, I need to have some money saved up. Oh, here. I can give you this. Thanks. I was just thinking of-- other ways of making money for school. Really? I think it's actually a smart idea. You do? Yeah. Everybody should have a Plan B in case your first choice doesn't work out. But Brooke, you're not gonna need it. This time next year, after you've been riding pro for a few months, they'll be throwing cash at you for sponsorships, spokesperson stuff-- believe you me, it's gonna be good. ( waitress ) I'm sorry, sir, your card was declined. Hm ! Ah, I must have given you the wrong one. Here, let me treat. No, no, I'm good, I'm good. I just might need to get me to an ATM. Thank you. It's okay, Dad. I wouldn't have any of this if it weren't for you. I'll pay you back. I know. [male voice sings fast tune] [applause] Bravos. Ever done them before? ( Brooke ) Yeah, they're stubborn as mules. ( male announcer ) All the way from Silverdale, Washington Brooke Preston, Ken Bradshaw, Rick McCalrey. [horn blares] [shouting in pen] [ indistinct lyrics ] [horn blares] [shout] ( male voice ) Watch it ! Whoa ! Whoa ! Brooke! Get him ! Get him ! [loud neighs] ( male voice ) Get the vet ! [much shouting] ( male voice ) He's having a heart attack. [loud neigh] [softer neighs] Sorry, Joe. Brooke. You shouldn't see this. [thunder and snort] ( Dad ) I'm sorry, Helen, I'll fix it. ( Dad )I swear I'll fix it. ( Mom ) You can't fix it Joe? ( Dad) I should've known better than to trust Dutch. ( Mom ) Trust? You flat-out lied to me about Dutch lending you that horse. ( Dad ) I had to get Brooke back in the game. ( Dad ) didn't know any other way to do it. ( Mom ) But a second mortgage? ( Mom ) You gambled with our home and you didn't even ask me. ( Dad ) I'm sorry, Helen. I was gonna pay off the mortgage with our winnings. I'll go to the bank, talk to them first thing tomorrow. No. No, there's no point, Joe. I was there this afternoon, they want their money. Not excuses. And if they don't get their money, they're gonna foreclose. We're gonna lose everything. ( Mom ) The manager agreed to give us a month before he starts doing anything. So listen, this is what you're gonna do. You go in, you tell Frank you're not gonna be out competing anymore. Okay, you pull some extra shifts. Get some overtime, get cash. I can't do that. Oh, Joe! Just ask him ! I can't ask him, Helen. I got fired. Oh, Joe ! I was gonna tell you ! If I'da just known that that horse was a time bomb! ( Mom ) Joe, look around you, okay? This is reality. This table. These walls. Me! This is your reality! [sobbing] Oh, Joe. The trouble with dreams is that you gotta wake up sometimes. I just wanted her to win. You don't get it, Joe ! You can win the world and still lose! ( Mom ) Brooke, you're gonna be late for school. Hey, hun. Did you sleep all right? I heard you moving around in the middle of the night. I didn't get much sleep. Oh? You feel alright? Is it true we're gonna lose the ranch because Dad bought me Ghost? [sigh] That's not your problem. It's me and your Dad's. Except he took out that mortgage to buy a horse for me. He thought he was doing the right thing. Why do you always stick up for him? He goes off and does what he wants and you just smile and start sweeping. I gotta feed Ginger. Ginger can wait. You think I'm weak because I stand by your dad? No, because you don't stand up to him ! I stand up to him ! Yeah? That's why you're selling cigarettes at the Tempo instead of opening for Keith Urban? You just swallowed that dream ! Don't you ever use that tone with me, Brooke. My dream was to have a family, and that's what I did. And there's nothing weak about that. But this isn't about me, is it, Brooke? If you don't raise your voice, how do you expect to be heard? I gotta go feed Ginger before the bus gets here. [soft snort] [weeping] Okay, Ginger. It's up to you and me now. We've gotta get back into the ring or I don't know what's gonna happen to you. Or me. [honking] That's the bus. [soft snort] I love you. [soft snorts] Hey! Hey. You okay? I'm fine. Yeah, I heard about your horse. I'm sorry. I don't really want to talk about it. You know I could use a bit more tutoring some time. Maybe today after school after my practice, or something like that? I can't. Do you want to stick around after my practice? We could... I'll give you a ride home. Caden, I can't. I have to get home to Ginger. Well, what about tomorrow then ? I'm busy then too. Okay, well if you ever have a minute to spare, just give me a call. [soft snorts] How are you doing, girl ? That leg bothering you? [loud snort] What are you doing? She still needs exercise. You be careful you don't overdo it. Shhh. Alright, Ginger. Here's the deal. We're gonna start you off by walking. Like yesterday. Then I'm gonna let you go a little faster afterward. But no galloping, no jumping. You hear? You damage that tendon and we are all out of luck. [female voice sings lively song] ( Brooke ) It's not so bad. I'm sorry, I'm not hiring. [loud snorts] [neighs] So you might have something maybe next week? No, I don't think so. [snort] Good job, girl. Alright, easy, girl. Hey. I was startin' to think you'd moved to another school. How come I haven't seen you in class? Right now we need to make money. I can't go to school and do that. So you're dropping out. That's the deal. Got it? Yeah, I got it. You've gone off the deep end. What happened with wanting to be a veterinarian? I don't have a choice! If I don't do this, I may not go to school at all. I may not go anywhere! Forget it, you don't understand. Understand? I throw a ball, Brooke. That's all I can do. And if i don't, I'm nothing. Caden-- Look. You're smart. You can be anything you want to be. ( Caden ) You have choices. I just hope you make the right ones. Looks good, Ging. [soft snort] Need a hand with that? No, I'm good. Your school called today. You wanna tell me why you been ditchin'? I'm dropping out. Dropping out? You wanna tell me why? We have to compete. No, you gotta get your schoolin'. There's still some inflammation, so I've got to rebuild the muscle-- You gotta get your schoolin', Brooke! First you don't want me to go to school, now you do, Dad. What do you want? Well, I don't want you to be me. Everything's changed since I was your age. It used to be, if you could work with your hands, you could get good at something and make decent money. Now, you gotta get the degree just to get the chance to work at something. And how am I supposed to get a degree, Dad? It's not like we can afford it. I screwed up, honey, I know that. These last couple of weeks looking fer-- work that pays decent money has really slapped me on the head. I guess I always thought that somehow the money that we'd make from you winning would just fix everything. Maybe I put too much faith in our dream. It's your dream, Dad. It was always your dream. I never cared about winning. It was about making you proud of me. Problem is I have to win now, whether I want to or not. I'm really not like you, Dad. I'm not like you at all. Dinner's ready. I'm not hungry. [climbing footsteps] [sigh] Didn't go too well, huh? Well, no. What are we gonna do, Joe? Well, look, I didn't want to tell you cuz it isn't definite yet but-- Harry Black, he works with me over at Frank's, I don't think you ever met him. Well, he called me, and he's leaving Frank's, he's opening his own garage over in Shelton next month, and naturally he knew I was available, There's nothing under the sun I can't fix, so-- So, we were talking salary. And it looks like he might be able to pay me a little bit better than Frank did. And then once the place takes off, he's promising a big raise. So what do you think about that? Stop it. What? Don't lie to me, Joe. ( Helen ) Here you go. ( Dutch ) Thank you, Helen. Is everything alright? What's going on? What are you doing here? I asked him to come, Joe. [sigh] Joe, I am so sorry about that horse. He was getting a little high strung and erratic, which is one of the reasons I wanted to get a new horse, but I had no idea that he'd go over the edge like that. Yeah, well, I made a deal and I'll stick with it. We can work something out. I don't need your handouts. Joe! I mean it. I thought, maybe after all these years, it might be time to bury the hatchet. Should-a known better than to get involved with you again. If it wasn't for you-- I am not gonna take the blame because you can't pen no more. I'm gonna put oil in the truck. When I come back, I want you gone. Why would Joe blame you for his accident? He doesn't blame me for the accidents, he blames me for what comes after. He never told you any of this? No. Well, when we were riding partners, we co-owned his horse, Storm. After the accident, while he was in the hospital, well, he was totally out of it, there was medical bills piling up, and there was nobody to pay them so I sold Storm. I gave him half the money, I gave him more than half the money, I swear. I believe you. Well, when Joe got out of the hospital finally, he was furious at me. He said he could-a ridden again but without his horse, there wasn't even any point trying. Well, doctors said he couldn't ride, it was dangerous. Yeah. You know that, I know that, but Joe got this idea in his head that if I hadn't sold Storm he would-a gone back in the saddle. I'm as sorry as I can be about this, Helen. Joe is a good man. But he's got a grudge against me. I don't see there's anything I can do to change that. Thanks for the coffee. [knocking] Brooke. Come in. Sit. You haven't being going to class. What's going on? My grades dropped. I figured there wasn't any point of coming anymore. Of course, there's a point. A friend of mine brought me all the assignments. I'm working on those. And this is a special biology project. Mr. Coleman thought it might help me get a scholarship for Washington State. Good night. I love you. I love you too. Good night. ( Brooke ) Good night. ( male voice ) That was great, man ! Hey. I don't believe it. Well. I came to watch you play. So I guess this means I owe you one. Like I said, you come to one of my games, I watch you compete. Actually, I was hoping you'd do me a favor. Wanna go on a little road trip with me? Sure. So you sure you don't want to wait till your parents get home? No, my dad will wanna come, [grunt] and that will trigger everything that I'm trying to escape. He'll think I'm doing it for him. I'm doing it because I have to. [whinnying] You know the last time I camped out like this. I was like eight years old. We went on a road trip to the mountains and for two nights we slept outside. It was amazing. It was like the higher we went, the closer the stars got. You're amazing. It takes a lot of courage to do this. It's too bad you can't-- no, forget it. What? What? Oh, nothing. No, you're perfectly adequate the way you are. What can't I do? Okay. You can't dance. What? You said so yourself. I've always been too self-conscious. No one's here to laugh at you. There's no music. One sec. [click] [female voice sings romantic song] [female voice sings romantic song] [female voice sings romantic song] Mind if we take a break from dancing? No. [romantic song] Brooke's gone. What? Ginger, her tackle, everything. I called Caden's parents and he's gone too. She's going to Denver. To the finals? To the finals. [male voice sings country song] [ Brooke ] It's your dream, Dad. [ Brooke ] It was always your dream. [ Brooke ] I'm really not like you, Dad. [ Brooke ] I'm not like you at all. I love you. I love you too. ( male announcer) Welcome to Denver ) ( male announcer) For the national penning finals.

( male announcer ) Here they go! [horn blares] Go! [general shouting in pen] [general shouting in pen] Yeah ! [scrape] ( Rick ) Agh ! ( Brooke ) Rick ! [horn blares] Yeah ! You okay? I'm cut. Looks like we're in seventh place. It's enough to put us into the finals. Give me a hand. Rick, you can't ride, you can't even stand. What are we gonna do? Brooke? Dad? Mom? Before you say a word, I know why you're here. I don't want you to do this if you don't want to. The bank will give us a few extra days. Your mother and I'll figure all that out. Miss Alcott called. You got the scholarship. We're so proud of you, honey. I got the scholarship? You got the scholarship. You don't have to do this if you don't want to. I want to do this Dad. Only-- [sigh] Must've caught a bur on steel or something. I'm cut pretty deep. Maybe we'll find a spare to ride in Rick's place. It's the finals, I don't think you're gonna find a spare around here. We can't get this far and give up! Joe. What? It's time you finished that ride you started 18 years ago. [ Brooke ] Mom ! What if he gets thrown? He might never walk again ! He's not gonna get thrown. Are you? No. 'Cause I'm thinking like a winner. I'm starting to feel like one too. You ready to ride with your old man? I'm ready!

Yah ! Yah ! I got him ! I got him ! Good call ! Bring him in ! ( Ken ) Looks like one of the sevens has a bad leg. [whinny] Dad ! Dad ! If that isn't a winning time, I don't know what is! ( female voice ) Congratulations! Thank you. [loud neigh] Ha. There you go, girl. Now you can rest that leg for a while. You deserve it. She is quite a horse. Yes, she is. I forgot how much fun it is. That was incredible. Well, here. This is for you. I want you to take this and pay the bank off. Baby, no. This'll be my last competition for a while. It'd be nice if the prize makes everyone happy. You're gonna have a whole lot of expenses at Washington State. (Mom ) Goodness, you guys were incredible. Hey, baby. Ohhh ! My goodness, you guys! ( Caden ) You're amazing ! I always said you were a natural born penner. Well, thanks, Dutch. I almost felt like I knew what I was doing out there. I've been thinking, Joe. It took a lot for you to call me. I know you don't know a lot about the computer chips on these new rigs, but I will pay for your training. Well what do you say? The jobs yours if you want it. [ Joe ] What do you think ? You think I could look like an oil rig mechanic? You think I could look like a veterinarian? I think you can look like anything you want to look like. So, it's a deal ? You got a deal ! Ginger, how would you feel about taking early retirement? [laughter] [ Brooke ] She'll feel like a winner Dad. Just like me. [male voice sings slow song]
