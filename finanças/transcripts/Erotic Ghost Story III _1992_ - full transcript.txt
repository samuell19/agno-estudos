In my opinion, living is the most important issue of mankind Have food, have fun and go freely The rest are of no consequence What's your priestly name, please? How come you can transform yourself into different size? I am the Reverend Wick I became a monk since childhood. I am now responsible to guard the Wick Tower Facing the lamp day and night is boring and I have no one to chat with I pour out my feelings to the lamps only Real or imagined, the wick talked with me one day He taught me the incantation that shrinks me But I might get burnt to death If the lamp burns out before I change back Thank you May I ask your names, please? I'm Chu Chung, and she's Lau... Ha-wai Greeting, Mr Chu, Mr Lau Please don't stand on ceremony. Call us by name is fine. You keep him company while I go in to change Mr Lau has a sense of humor. Let's go over there for a chat - Please - Please Sit down, please Abbot, what you told us just now... Life likes a wick. It's gone, once burnt out Compared with the centuries-old universe, life's a speck only, rights? Forget it now. When you reach my age, you'll understand Abbot, are you all right? When were you born? The 9th day, 5th moon, year of the Rat Between 7 to 9 in the morning? How do you know? No wonder! Congratulations! Your fate is full of masculinity and strength! It is very rare on earth. What did you say? I mean... You won't understand no matter how I put it In a word, you're extraordinary I feel like we are old friends I've got good wine "Daughter Red". Let me get it for all of us Don't fool around. Wait for me here. What an extraordinary man! - You bloody monk! Why are you here? - Sex is nothings and nothings is sex Mr Lau, no... Miss Lau, so you're a lady You scoundrel, you peeped at me bathing! No, I didn't see anything How do you know I'm a lady then? Miss Lau, don't blame me First, I didn't know you were taking a bath Second, I didn't know you were female Creep, in what way you learnt your Buddhism? Drop dead, you horny monk! Enough, even a Buddha may flare up! Nudity doesn't count for much Every creature is naked at birth Have you seen a chicken or duck dressed? Buddha be praised! The Bodhi is not like the tree, The mirror bright is nowhere shining As there is nothing from the first, Where can the dust itself collect? I'm in no mood for your Zen poems. I've already suffered. You're a creep, a real creep! Miss Lau, if you deem that as a loss Come and touch me, knead me any way you like. Don't ever try to scare me! Chu Abbot I told you not to move around Abbot, that fairies in the portrait smiled at me Chu, illusion will not exist without imagineation Your distracting thoughts breed illusions. What I saw didn't look like illusion Men belong to earth; spirits belong to hell It's a bad omen if men and spirits meet at the same space Chu, you'd better forget what you've seen Abbot, you mean what I saw is real? Abbot, how can I ever see her again? Do me a favor, please No, it's dangerous I'm a wanderer with no worries. I'm not afraid at all. You may lose your life! I'd die without regrets if I could see her once Fate! I'll help you so as not to go against Heaven's will But you must promise me one thing You must come back within 24 hours Well, I promise Don't take this as a precedent If you hasn't returned when this incense burns out you'll drift in the Void without ever getting back Turn this wheel of the dharma Read this passage of sutras and you can move freely And when coming upon any danger Throw out the wheel, and you'll be safe. Remember! Thank you The world-honored master's adamantine body; Turn the wheel of dharma with all my heart To enter the unborn passage Buddha be praised! Hands off! Don't do it, disgusting! Let go! Mr Chu How do you know my name? My name is Wan Yee-Mung My late dad is a famous fortune teller He can tell the past and predict the future After reading my fortune, he told me I'd come upon an inexorable doom at 17 Don't cry. Confide it to me He said I was fated to stay in hell for a period Before you'd appear to take me as your wife Don't worry, I won't hurt you Dad said my life is not yet over After we have sex, your yang can help bring me back to earth Your ladyship Where's Yee-mung? She's in the room opposite Why didn't you announce the presence of a guest? I must host a feast for him tonight Yes, your ladyship Namas Amita Buddha... Please don't knock anymore, I beg you! A monk is delighted by others reading sutras Why are you an exception? You chanted and knocked all night, How could I fall asleep? I won't do it anymore if you tell me where Chu Chung is Well, come with me, come with me Come, come Where's he? As I told you repeatedly he's walked into the wall You're lying again See for yourself How can such a strong wall be penetrated? And I saw nothing inside from outside You asked me but won't believe what I said Have you heard of Hellgate? What? Hellgate? No, but not much different from it This painting is a crossing between earth and hell Laymen like you won't understand He entered it a long while ago. He should return now This question is difficult to answer Don't you know the mess outside? The Court changes its policy everyday. Chu won't come out probably because he prefers to stay inside Don't be silly, I was only joking He'll come back for sure before the incense burns out He won't forsake his life. Am I right? Don't worry. They come and go freely, let it be You came a long way to here, Mr. Chu. Let me toast you celebrates your vsiit. Thank you - Let's go over to tease him - Good idea Brother-in-law, sister, we want to propose a toast Come on, drink with arms locked Look at brother-in-law, sister. A blush came into his cheeks. We're now of one family, Mr. Chu. Let me toast to you We're now of one family, Mr. Chu. Let me toast to you Your ladyship. I'm afraid master can't drink Let me drink it for him No, it's from her ladyship to brother-in-law Sister can't drink it for him I should drink it to appreciate her kind thought Brother-in-law, drink it, you can't get drink Brother-in-law, great!

She was abducted by old Demon Kap Yuen, we are uncertain of her current situation We're at a loss what to do Where's Kap Yuen? Take me there right away Here it is Which evildeor dares to destroy my gold-body? You not only defiled their virtue But also abducted Yee-Mung Hand over Yee-Mung quickly! What did you say? Which Yee-Mung? No more nonsense with him. He won't admit it for sure Fight with him! There's no grudge between us. Why trying to kill me? You... Your day is near You don't understand? I know my sentimental brother-in-law has a strong yang And only his blood can spoil your immortal body And put you to death I acted to set him up I've endured you for long. Do you think a tutelary god, can put on an act and restrict us from doing this and that From now on, I'll be in charge here After eating your flesh I can get out of the painting and rule the world Wonderful Now let me finish you off. Don't! - Bring them back - Yes Get up! Go! Go! Miss Lau, eat something first No, thanks, I have no appetite You must eat Abbot, will he be in danger? Not now I can't tell in four hours Why? The wheel is the key to pass in and out of the painting. But there's a time limit When the incense burns out, the hellgate closes What if he can't come back? He'll be loiter in between man's world and hell He can't be a man or a ghost Abbot, do something. Let me bring him out Stop dreaming You're so fragile, Miss Lau After entering, you may not live to get out and you don't look well Get out of here quick to avert the doom I won't, even at death. I must wait for him to return Yee-Mung, you're so beautiful. Let's play together Come on. Come on. Stop it. Keep away! See you later Keep away! Load the blood Let's play together Keep away! Why don't they play with me? Your ladyship, this is the hand of Kap Yuen Deity. After another 49 days, I can get out of the painting To rule the mundane world Food is so coarse. Inedible! You ladyship, I've prepared good wine for you Bring it quickly Yes Bring it quickly Sister She's staring at us. Let's pretend that we are having fun. Or we'll get into trouble. Come on Bring Chu Chung to my room right away Yes Her ladyship wants to see him. Yes What are you doing? Take advantage of me to kill someone again? Chu, I know it was my fault But if I don't obey her We may both get killed Don't think you can convince me with that I know I can't possibly convince you Well, let me take you out of the painting My wheel was taken away by her. How can I leave? I'll get it back for you for sure Why do you want to take him away? Fox demon, her ladyship ordered sister to take him away Take him away Yes Come in Go in Your ladyship, Chu Chung's here - Yes - Put him to bed Why are you two coming in?

Go Sister, let me lure her away. You go with brother-in-law Chun-meng - Yes - Get hold of them! Help me turn the wheel of dharma The world-honored master's adamantine body; Turn the wheel of dharma with all my heart To enter the unborn passage Good! It hurts. Oh, no, he's finished! You couldn't be right. He'll be back for sure Incredibly, here he is! Chu, Chu, are you all right? Abbot, his body is burning. What should we do? He may have been hurt by Kap Yuen. It's finished Anything serious, abbot? You must help him. Kap Yuen's axe is a sacred item from Heaven No layman can hold it because of its heavy yang content Unless...... Unless what? Unless we can find a girl ready to sacrifice her virginity to him. To squeeze his yang out. That's the only ray of hope But it could be dangerous I'll help him You? Right, I'll help him No more delay if you're in a position to save his life. These braziers are arrayed according to the Big Dipper They absorb the essence of sun, moon and the auras of heaven and earth Why don't you start now? Show me how to do it Ask a monk to teach you this? Okay. Wait a moment. Let me think. Have you got any idea? I got it. A monk's six roots of sensations are pure and clean A layman's six roots are not clean See if Chu has got that "root" Root? Something like this No, no, no. This one is too big! More or less like this one, understand? I've found it. What shall I do next? What then? What then? Alright When I was a neophyte one day, some prostitutes came and asked for a religious service to mourn for their pander The abbot gather all the monks of the temple and he gave us a test During the service, we all sat on the floor With the "wooden fish" between our legs It's just like that now What's the idea? Those prostitutes wore sexy dresses The abbot said a monk will drum on the "wooden fish" if his thoughts cannot free from lust What happened then? What happened? During the service, every monk drummed on the "wooden fish" Only an old monk did not drum At first, we praised him for his endurance But when he stood up, the wooden fish didn't drop on the floor What's that mean? The wooden fish was stuck up by his root Have you got anything with you like the wooden fish? You're evil. Enough. I know what to do now. You started with it. Why call me evil? What happened to your wooden fish? I'm ashamed to say it You must tell me. Are you sure? Yes Well, listen My wooden fish burst into pieces So terrific? You don't believe it? Don't ask me anymore. Save his life first. Undress Yee-Mung Yee-Mung Yee-Mung Yee-Mung Yee-Mung All right, be more intimate Yee-Mung Yee-Mung Chu has hope now Miss Liu, put on your clothes now Finished? Yes Why has he not come to? Do you think you are a fairy or something? Not so soon How do you feel? I'm all right, but a bit tired Only a bit? What do you say? Miss Lau, you must take a rest yourself too I'm going out and pluck him some herb medicine. Don't worry. He'll be fine. Take good care of him Yee-Mung Yee-Mung... Don't desert me Yee-Mung Yee-Mung... Don't desert me Your ladyship, she's passing out Splash to sober her up Yes Anyone disobey my order will end up like her Halt Who are you? What's your relation to Chu Chung? I'm Lau See-see, Chu Chung is my husband. You evils, you wreak havoc everywhere. Let me go! Or I'll kill you all! This young lady talks big Fox demon, teach her a lesson Yes Stop! Dare you to talk big again? Take her to my bedroom and let me fix her Yes How are we to dispose of this tramp Yee-Mung? Confine her in prison right away I'll eat her to go with my drink tomorrow Yee-Mung You laymen are a real nuisance You turn down someone who loves you And insist on getting the one who doesn't love you You're almost lost your life because of love Yee-Mung Now you're getting me involved Be nice and drink it Where's Yee-Mung? Priest, where's Yee-Mung? Damn you, you're heartless! You're still thinking of her now If Miss Lau hadn't saved you with her virginity You'd have been in hell massaging the demons See-see How do you feel? A little pain Triangular love is bad enough, but you're torn between earth and hell See how you can cope with it What has become of you? I was used by an old lady to kill Kap Yuen Deity Did you kill him? Yes That's serious, you've even killed Kap Yuen Deity It's going to be upside-down in hell What sort of a person is that old lady? She's not human, she's a wolf with 1,000 year's practice Only Kap Yuen can overpower her Miss Lau's doom is not yet over Priest, where's See-see? Why ask her since you don't love her? Let her go where she likes Where on earth is she? It's sexual love again I must thank mammy for having made me a monk so early in my life Don't talk nonsense now I talk nonsense? I climbed up mountains picking herbs for you And you said I'm talking nonsense? I know your noble personality but I'm worry about See-see Where's she? Come with me Only this left, have a look. Priest Don't count me in. I don't want to die yet. They've both saved me once If we don't go in, they'll die for sure It's fate. You can't help it if they must die Don't let me be buried with them You're a Buddhist and you won't care to help You can't go against the decree of fate, understand? - Give me the wheel. Give it to me - Don't, don't be crafty! The world-honored master's adamantine body; Turn the wheel of dharma with all my heart Don't, we may die! What now? I told you that I don't want to get killed in here but you won't listen That's true. I haven't eat enough, I haven't play enough. Dying this way is unfair to myself. Do you understand? Priest, don't you care about Yee-Mung and See-see? I won't live without them Hold that wheel Disobey and you suf..fer... and you suffer right away! Wait Buddha be praised! Yu-meng, it's you! Brother-in-law, let me go first No, who knows if she's good or evil Never mind. We have no time to waste. I'll take you to rescue sister Yee-Mung, you are so tender-skinned What a pity if you were eaten by that old woman Marry me, and I'll beg mercy from her Open up. I got orders to take her away Yes Let me go! Let me go! Sin, sin! Priest, are you all right? I'm fine. Do you know a girl named Lau See-see? Yes. She sacrificed her virginity to save Chu You're... The reverend Wick Buddha be praised! Miss Lau was captured by the old hang. Go and help her quick! But what? - But... That old hag has eaten Chia Yuan's flesh and increased her power We may not be able to overpower her In any case, we'll fight Follow me Fight? It'd be death for sure. Wait for me. Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Help! You won't suffer much if you're nice Don't, don't! Take me to the bed Take you to the bed? Don't you know I have extraordinary power? Look Hold it Hold it Wait Chu, don't let it burn out. My life now depends on you How am I to contact you? In a word, that lamp mustn't burn out Be careful Who is it? Your ladyship, it's me Come on, come and join in the fun Big woman? What a sin! What a smell! When did she wash her feet last time? It stinks! Who'd enter hell if I don't? I'm damned to be a monk. Now my life's practice is gone! What is it? It stinks, it's sort of wet It stinks. I'll kick you dead Damn, damn! I'll kill you! Yee-Mung, are you all right? Yes. Go and help Miss Lau first Master Let's go. Who are you? Come out quickly! Devil, lay down your sword and be saintly! Otherwise, your thousand years' practice will be gone!

The world-honored master's adamantine body; Turn the wheel of dharma with all my heart To enter the unborn passage Oh, no more oil! Hold it! Are you ok? Master Catch Kill that devil or I'm finished. Come on! I don't want to die here. That'll deny me to go to the Western Paradise Try to burn her with fire Pour the oil quickly Light the fire! Prajnaparamita, Prajnaparamita! See-see How are you, See-see? - See-see - Miss Lau Don't be sad. Now I understand that an importunate demand will never be achieved. Cut it out!

See-see Miss Lau See-see Yee-Mung. Yee-Mung. We won't part, we won't Yee-Mung So luck's with me Priest Chu, you're out? Miss Lau really is... We can't go against Heaven. Buddha be praised! Priest, Yee-Mung may evaporate in no time. Try to help her now! Chu, don't worry A mundane being sacrifices oneself for you One in hell returns to earth and is reborn It's a swap between hell and earth Chu, fortune did smile on you By dint of your strong yang and true love You can shuttle between earth and hell And bring Yee-Mung back to earth Buddha be praised! Thank you, priest Don't mention it It's better to be an earthly man
