Ladies and Gentlemen, John Travolta. Honestly. In your life, have you ever heard "Maria" sung more beautifully? Oh, my gosh. Okay. Well, good evening, and welcome. If you love movies and you love music even more, then it's a good thing that you've joined us here in the heart of Hollywood at the Dolby Theatre. Tonight, Oscar-winning film composers and songwriters meet one of the greatest voices of our time: Andrea Bocelli. Our evening began with one of the greatest love songs, "Maria", from one of the greatest musicals, West Side Story, composed by none other than Leonard Bernstein. The revolutionary impact of West Shoe Show on Broadway made it inevitable that it would transfer to the silver screen, where it won an amazing ten Academy Awards. But we're here tonight to also celebrate Italian contributions to cinema. First and foremost, we must turn to the composer Ennio Morricone. Morricone has had a prolific career composing the scores to over 70 films, both in Italy and here in Hollywood. A lifetime of achievement that was recently recognised with an honorary Oscar. One of his most beloved scores was composed for an Italian classic: the Academy Award-winning Cinema Paradiso. When you hear the first few notes of his theme, you can't help but feel transported to everybody's ideal of the classic Italian square. Thank you very much. It's a big pleasure and honour to have on stage with me a great musician, a great composer, above all, a great friend of mine. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the stage: David Foster. - Thank you, Andrea. - Hi, David. - And good evening. - Finally. Well, that was beautiful, - as John said. - Thank you. So, tonight... well, we're excited. Because we've made, what I think, is one of the most spectacular CDs ever. And it's called Cinema. I know, even though I've done film scores, you know that at heart I'm a song writer. And I also loved writing songs for films, because when we hear them later, they help us conjure up some great cinematic memories. I mean, what would Casablanca be without the song "As Time Goes By"? Well, I love very much the music of the cinema, or the movies. Because for me, because... It's a very free music. There is a big inspiration in this kind of music. I love it. And they're all great choices that we've picked for this CD. But for me, there was no better example of a film composer who could also score films and write memorable songs, like Henry Mancini. Let's see if the audience recognises this little gem. Thank you. And Andrea wanted, he wanted to play piano on that song. - But I wouldn't allow it. - No, no, I didn't-- No. I wouldn't let him. I don't like to give up my piano. It's your fault, because you arranged this piece with too many accords. Too many. Too complicated. Originally, the song was simple. - I'm sorry. - Now it's very complicated. Well, you're a very complicated man. Okay? That's not true. You know, in the early days of Hollywood, the studios lured many great songwriters to Hollywood from Broadway, like the Gershwins and Irving Berlin. And many of the classics of The American Songbook came from this era. You may find this hard to believe, but you think about it: it wasn't a famous singer like Sinatra or Bing Crosby, but instead it was Fred Astaire, who we remember as a great dancer, who probably introduced more of these classic songs to the public than anyone. So Andrea, tell us why this next song is so special to you. I heard this song when I was a child, and I was in love with this song. - But-- - You were in love? Or you were you in love with the song? No, no, at the time I was in love only for the song. Luckily. But I discovered that in my country, few people know the song. For this reason, I decided to translate the lyrics in Italian. Keeping the meaning of the song. And it has another meaning which you'll find out in a little minute, as we do this song. Okay. I trust you. - Thank you very much. - Veronica Berti Bocelli. Beautiful job. Thank you. You know I'm not a singer. I did all my best. No, but can I just say really quickly... We were making the record at their home. We needed a demo singer. Veronica is very geographically desirable. - She was right in the house. - I was right there. Right there. "Come, leave the baby for a second. Sing the demo." And then we loved it so much that we kept it. Thank you so much, Veronica. Thank you. D major, D minor. Beautiful, and unexpected. In American music, there are some very interesting harmonies. But you can't make a Mario Lanza program without thinking of "Be My Love", "Because"... "Because" - I recorded that as well. Did you meet Mario Lanza? No, but I really admired him. And the fascinating part for everybody... José, Luciano, myself of course... and I think you too, we all grew up on his music. The first tenor I heard on record was Mario Lanza. And all those films, and the movie about Caruso... A true force, fuelled by the power of Hollywood. He gave amazing concerts, with challenging repertoire. I don't know why he never sang complete operas. Probably because he liked making movies. But really with that voice, even singers like Sinatra admired Mario Lanza. True. You know, I studied briefly with Franco Corelli... and he really liked Mario Lanza. Sure, how could they not love him-- a real Italian voice, and an inspiration for opera singers... even though he did not sing opera. That's Andrea Bocelli! Andrea, as we heard earlier, the melodies from the film music of Ennio Morricone, makes for beautiful songs. What is your favourite Sergio Leone film? Okay. Seriously, he is a great artist. But surely, one of the best movies is - Once Upon a Time in America. - Oh, yeah. And this melody was also too beautiful not to turn into a song. And one of the great things about Andrea Bocelli is people of all ages love his music. So Andrea, just tell us who your sons wanted to sing on this album, and who we got to sing a duet. Well, everybody wants to sing a duet with you, but this girl in particular. Well, they love very much Ariana Grande. And I organised a joke for my second son, Matteo. I was in Miami, in my house, and Ariana Grande came to visit me, just to speak about this piece. And after five minutes arrived also Matteo. And he was so surprised. And happy, of course. Of course. But she sang-- More happy than surprised, I think. She sang so beautifully on this record. And we have her voice with us tonight. Ladies and Gentlemen, "E Piu Ti Penso". - Is that the way to say it? - Almost perfect. Say it again, for me please? - "E Piu Ti Penso". - Exactly. Ariana Grande and Andrea Bocelli. Thank you. Very much. Ladies and gentlemen, Andy Garcia. Thank you very much. It's a great honour to be here. The historical epic film has been a staple of Hollywood dating back to the 1915 silent classic E. W. Griffith's Birth of a Nation. The tradition continued through films like Gone With The Wind, and really heated up in the 50s and 60s with the monumental productions like The Ten Commandments, Ben Hur, and Cleopatra. The collaboration between filmmaker David Lean and composer Maurice Jarre is heard in the epics Lawrence of Arabia and Doctor Zhivago, whose melancholy strumming of the balalaika underscores the main melody, "Lara's Theme", which you will hear shortly from Andrea. But first, since this evening is both about Hollywood and Italian cinema, another landmark collaboration was between Federico Fellini and the composer Nino Rota in the masterpieces 8% and La Dolce Vita. But it's Francis Ford Coppola who provides Rota the epic opportunity in Hollywood when Rota pens the Oscar-winning score and song "Speak Softly, Love", for The Godfather. Once again, to sing these songs, Andrea Bocelli. Bravo, Andrea. Thank you very much. The Italian cinema gave us another Oscar-winning score from the beloved film II Postino. It's a fictional story based on the real-life Chilean poet Pablo Neruda, who teaches a simple postman to embrace and learn to love poetry. What could be more poetic than Andrea Bocelli singing the touching song from II Postino, Luis Bacal0v's melody "Mi Mancherai"? You know, I hate to give up my piano. - I know. - To anyone. Except... to you. - Okay. Thank you. - Please, maestro. Thank you. I was thinking the other day that I didn't know that I'd written many songs for movies, so I Googled myself. I swear to God. And it turns out that I've written 87 songs for movies. I didn't-- I had no idea. But most of them... ...are about love. And after four marriages, I don't know if that even makes sense anymore, but... Anyway, speaking of love... This is so good. If two actors were ever bonded together, forever, by a single movie, they are these two. Please welcome Ali MacGraw and Ryan O'Neal. Ladies and gentlemen, it's a huge privilege to be here tonight with you to celebrate great cinema and great music. It is indeed. And whether we are telling you a great love story, like we did so many years ago... Or sharing our play, Love Letters, on its national tour, the story never gets old. And neither does the music. Francis Lai wrote an amazing, Oscar-winning score for our film. Here to perform his new version of "Grazie Amore Mio". Wait, I thought they were doing Love Story. We are. But I wanted to cue our brilliant performer in his native language. Si. Ladies and gentlemen, singing the theme from Love Story... Andrea Bocelli. Thank you very much. You know, Andrea, sometimes a song is such an effective mood setter for a film that it's used a lot. Now, this next song has been heard in movies as diverse as All the King's Men, True Lies, and Schindler's List. But made famous by AI Pacino, who used it in the movie Scent of a Woman. It's a sexy, sexy song, correct? I think so. It's a very, very sad and deep song. And it's a tango, right? Right. This is called... Oh, you better say the title because I'm gonna not say it right. “For Una Cabeza“. “For Una Cabeza“. Tiffany Maher, Paul Karminyan, and Andrea Bocelli. Thank you very much. You know, Andrea, here in America there was a British invasion. And it wasn't the Beatles. Well, there was that, but I'm talking about an invasion of Broadway. Wow. With the epic musicals of Andrew Lloyd Webber. But before there were the mega hits Cats, Phantom, there was his biographical show on the life of Eva Perén. It was ultimately brought to the screen by Madonna. I want to introduce a duet partner now to Andrea. When we thought about doing this song as a duet. This young woman is so remarkable. And what's the best part is: she's such an amazing singer, who really feels this music from her heart. Please welcome Nicole Scherzinger. Okay, easy going there. Great job, Nicole. Thank you very much. - Grazie mille. - Nicole Scherzinger. Thank you very much. You know, every one of these songs that we picked to sing, just hearing them live, one after another, is just magnificent. It really is. Bravo, Andrea. That's very kind of you. Amazing. You know, it was at the 71st Academy Awards, that a little-known Italian comedian won an Oscar for Best Actor in a film that he also directed. I can't remember his name. But he was Italian. Roberto Benigni. Do you remember? Roberto Benigni. Yes. Yes. And he became very famous for his very enthusiastic acceptance speech that night. He was climbing over chairs, if you remember. Stepping on Steven Spielberg's head. It was crazy. But as a director, Benigni was fortunate to have an Oscar-winning score by Nicola Piovani. - Nicola Piovani. - Yeah, that. Finally, I can fix your Italian. It's true. Here is a new song, adapted from the bittersweet theme to La Vita Bella. And in English, Andrea, we call it? - "Life Is Beautiful." - Exactly. - Correct? - Exactly. From Santa Barbara, the Janet Adderley kids. - Thank you. - Great job, kids. I would say that if there was ever a song that was written for Andrea Bocelli to sing, that was it. For sure. - Bravo, Andrea. - Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
