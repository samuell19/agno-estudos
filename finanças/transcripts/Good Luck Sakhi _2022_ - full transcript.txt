Oh my! How beautiful you look, girl! No guy can be a right match to your beauty. What grandma? Is this marriage happening? Ah! Keep quiet now! Your son will arrive soon and this marriage will be done. [INSTRUMENTS PLAYING] Hey! The groom has arrived! See? He came riding a horse! [CRACKERS BURSTING] [HORSE NEIGHING] What now Grandma? Do you think the entire village calls her 'Bad luck Sakhi' for no reason? Look, what happened to my son now! Done with your comments on my luck? You can leave, now. Of course, we will! Enough of this. Be brave, girl. The Prince who'd change your fate will arrive soon. [GROANS SARCASTICALLY] "Chick chicki... Chick chicki..." "There comes Bad luck Sakhi." "Chick chicki... Chick chicki..." "There comes Bad luck Sakhi." "Come here, Sakhi... let's talk about something interesting." "Funny gossips..." "Oh so gone!" "How long would you take to marry, Sakhi?" "Why don't you marry soon?" "Who's the one that would tame you?" "When would he stand beside you?" "Luck has left you, lovely girl." "Now you're ultimately caught by Bad luck!" "Chick chicki... Chick chicki..." "There comes Bad luck Sakhi." "Chick chicki... Chick chicki..." "There comes Bad luck Sakhi." "Chick chicki... Chick chicki..." "There comes Bad luck Sakhi." "These bangles have waited too long." "What's your reply to them about your wedding?" "Ask them why are they bothered about me." "Girl's love to get ready beautifully." "We don't get tired in the course of beautifying ourselves." "Why does such beauty need further beautification?" "Don't just throw us answers." "Don't roam around carelessly." "Change your fate now!" "Stop it now!" "Chick chicki... Chick chicki..." "There comes Bad luck Sakhi." "Chick chicki... Chick chicki..." "There comes Bad luck Sakhi." "Chick chicki... Chick chicki..." "There's no need of luck for my wedding." "Chick chicki... Chick chicki..." "Enough of it, now go home!" Where's this girl? "I don't believe in luck!" "There is no bad omen worse than your stare." Oh! "The sun falls sick when you wakeup in the morning." "Even the sunflowers wilt seeing you." "Anyone who crosses your path is doomed." "Any lucky fellow is doomed by your presence." "Your fame has spread to the neighbouring villages too." "Everything has changed except your fate!" "Chick chicki... Chick chicki..." "Here comes Bad luck Sakhi." "Chick chicki... Chick chicki..." "There comes Bad luck Sakhi." "Chick chicki... Chick chicki..." "Why do you bully me?" "Chick chicki... Chick chicki..." "Shut your mouth everyone!" "I'm least bothered about your tittle-tattle." "My fate..." [LAUGHS] "I'll carve it myself!" GOOD LUCK SAKHI Welcome, Colonel sir. Ah... I have got the house ready for you. I mean, she did it. How did you know that I'm about to stay here? I didn't inform that on call! The air here carries all the information. You don't seem to be married. Our boy Shankar would take care of you. So what else did you air tell you? It says, you have left the army... As you didn't want to live in the city, you've returned to your native village. Above all, you prefer to be addressed as 'Colonel' rather than by your name.. What's in a name. Name was given without my consent. But I earned the rank 'Colonel'. I don't care about what's not mine. Well in that case, you haven't earned anything in your life! She's talking to you. Get the luggage. - Please come, Colonel. - OK. Sir... how long are you going to stay here? For sometime. I meant, is it a week or a month or an year. Depends on the circumstances. Circumstances? Like what? No one asked me so many questions even when I was leaving the Army. Just to make sure you do not have any hassles in your stay. Hey... leave the black bag there. - Shall we leave? - Sure. I'll take your leave, sir. Hey! I told you to leave the black bag there! - Sir... - Tell me Shankar. There's something fishy, sir. - He is roaming all around the house. - Is it? Also, he has some black bag with him. A black bag? He hid it in the cupboard carefully. Get to know what's in it then! Quick! Or else I would be very tensed. You know about me, don't you? OK. Listen, dear. Your inquisitiveness leads to hastiness, that leads to breathlessness... And that leads to Asthma. That might cost you, your life. She's crazy. She links everything to my doom. The first groom. Second groom. - Third one. - Number four. The damages this time... Neck, left hand and two knees. Forgot the hip? Let the third doll arrive. I'll show you. [ALL LAUGH] Sir... some people arrived with some tools and a table. They are even measuring our backyard. They are planning to construct something. Here's a task. This phone has a camera. Click pictures using this. Listen, dear. If you use the phone all the time... The radiations would cause lumps in the brain. If they burst, it will cost you, your life. She is always bothered about my death. Yes, sir. We have to do this to protect the nation. Open it. [GROANS COMMANDINGLY] This is the bag. There could be bombs in it, sir! That's OK. Before the nation, our lives don't matter. I guessed it. I guessed it, right from the beginning. This gun looks strange. Check, what else is he hiding? So, you've found out my secrets. Hands up, sir. Stand back. Keep both your hands behind your back. Kneel down. Which one do I do first? First, put your hands up, sir. Next, we will think about it. That's not loaded. - What? - There are no bullets in it. I found out your plan. - Is it? - Yes. I called the DIG too and he is on his way here. - But when? - I did, you moron! Couldn't you wait till I talked to you? OK, let it be, come with me. First, put those guns down. They are expensive. Are you coming or not? What is it, sir? Don't panic. I'm not preparing for any war. I'm about to train shooters, who will make our nation proud. Come in. An announcement to all the residents of Danduluru village! A troupe from Anantapuram is playing 'Kurukshetra' Drama for our entertainment. Witness Krishna, Arjuna, Karna, Bheema... And others indulge in fierce fights at war. Only tonight! Four hundred to her. Is it true, darling? Heard the fifth groom ran away as well? Don't address me that way. I don't like it. But I like it, girl! What about Kurukshetra drama and Reddy sir's cot in the night? Hey! Why don't you take your wife there? My wife is a darling! She'd understand. What say Jyothi? You don't mind! Don't you have any shame at all? What do I do? I'm helpless. - I'm a man. - Hey! Stop your nonsense and go check the bags. Now! I just said that. Don't mind. That's OK, dear. He is just a barking dog. One which doesn't bite. Isn't he? Let's go. [CROWD APPLAUDING] [SAKHI CHUCKLES] [HARMONIUM BEING PLAYED] It's impossible to lift the chariot wheel. Do you want to fight... or leave the battlefield? That's not happening Krishna. Karna never steps back. Think no more, Arjuna! Kill your enemy Karna, at once. How can I kill an unarmed man and that too a brother? Where was this morale when he killed your son, Abhimanyu? No, brother. You've got to shoot him. [ARJUNA] I can't, brother. KRISHNA: Shoot him, brother. Hey, babe! ARJUNA: I can't. KRISHNA: Shoot him! ARJUNA: I can't, brother. Leave me. Thinking is of no use now, Arjuna! Treachery is the answer to treachery. Aim the arrow. Shoot! Victory is ours if, we aim wholeheartedly! Huh! Wait... Victory is ours if, we aim wholeheartedly! Goli Raju! Goli Raju! [CROWD LAUGHING] What crap! [CROWD LAUGHING] Horse, soldier, monkey, Nakula and Sahadeva. I worked hard for six years and playing these roles. At last, I got to act as Arjuna and everything has gone to waste! - Even Yudhishtira. - Yeah. - Bro... - Yeah. Your scream spoiled my entire fame, that I got from working hard. Don't misunderstand, Raju. Seeing you after so many years made me shout with joy. You waited for twenty years. Couldn't you wait for an hour? Pardon me, Goli Raju. What's this Goli Raju? Look, I changed my name. My stage name is Rama Rao. Oh! If you are Rama Rao, I'm Savithri. Reddy sir! - You acted so well, Rama Rao. - Thank you, sir. But you shouldn't have hit the arrow on his rear. - Sorry, sir. - That's alright, man. You're a super star in the neighboring districts! - Thank you. - By the way... My daughter bought me a new phone. Now, we are selfie experts. Let's take a selfie. OK? OK. That's nice, sir. Listen, I'm arranging another show for you tomorrow morning. - You should act well. - Sure. Make sure you aim the arrow well this time. - Come on, Reddy sir. - I'll take your leave. I'll leave now. You've become so famous, Raju? Of course! My fans shouldn't be upset tomorrow. I've got to do it well. - Yes, bro. - Arrange for rehearsals. Okay, I'll leave now. - Play now! - Just wait. Bro, this girl will play the last game. Girls can't play here. Are you scared to play with this girl? She is just a kid, bro! Fine, let her play. As she is a girl, she can play from a nearer spot. Stop. [SAKHI] What is it, Raju? Take these. Hey Goli Raju! You said you didn't have any marbles left? Where did you get these from? These are my lucky marbles, bro. I can't put them in game. Fine, play now. Wait. Victory is ours if we aim wholeheartedly! Do we play a double? [SOBBING] These marbles are bringing my shorts down. Are you ready? "We challenge you... check us out!" "Stack them up all in your pocket." Uncle, make a watch for me... make it two. A chain and ring for me. Raju! Goli Raju is here. No, he is Rama Rao. It's Goli Raju. I shouldn't have been angry with you yesterday. No, I shouldn't have spoiled your play. Rama Rao... The name is of no use now... The entire village knows my name, thanks to you. But I like the name Raju. Not Raju, it's Goli Raju. Uncle, make a watch for me... make it two. A chain and ring for me. I got this habit of acting in plays from my father. We acted in a lot of plays once we left. My father doesn't have the energy anymore. So I started acting in plays. I heard something about your bad luck. Everyone calls me 'Bad luck Sakhi'. I don't believe in all that crap. But, anytime I'm in a problem, I hold these for some courage. Let me see... Are these the same? The ones you gave me. Even these couldn't save those five grooms? That's wasn't my mistake! One man isn't enough to bear this beauty. That's true. RAJU: I'm penning a new play. It's called Maya Bazaar. - So you write too? - I penned a lot! Paathaala Bhairavi, Daana Veera Sura Karna... - Chintamani... - Raju! Huh? Marbles! Remember, how we cheated everyone in our childhood? - You used to lose first. - Then you come in with an innocent face. You would say 'Poor girl... let her play the last game, bro.' And then you knocked them all! Those were fun days! Is your aim still intact? That was in childhood, Raju. Why not check it out once. - Oh yeah! - Come then! Hey kid... let this girl play a game. OK bro, take them. Here you go. Holding these 'Good luck marbles' this way... [TAKES DEEP BREATH] - The front line or the rear ones? - The rear one. Victory is ours if we aim wholeheartedly! That was awesome! - That was a good shot! - Again! [SAKHI CHUCKLES] - [IN UNISON] Greetings. - Greetings. I gathered as many as I could. What do you say? Everyone looks to be rich. Yes, sir. They are rich and educated. Mr. Reddy and I used to go hunting in our youth. Ah! Even we are well versed with guns. Is there a rule about age in the game, sir? Nothing as such! That's great! Mr. Reddy and I will start. Well, someone has to start. Come. Hope you settled down. Step 1. Posture. Which means... the way we stand. Maintain some gap between the legs. Are you charging towards me? Make them straight. Make sure the feet align. Step 2. Hold the gun with your left hand and grip it into your right hand this way. Step 3. The back of the gun is called 'Back side 'U' shape'. Now, align the back side shoulders parallel to the 'Front side tip'... Now, align the back side shoulders parallel to the front tip... And aim towards the target. Got it? Keep your body stiff and relax your left hand. Now tilt the gun... [SHOTS FIRED] [SHOTS FIRED] Are you just good with guns, or have you ever fired them? My bad. I should've told you before we spoiled the wall. Give me one more day, Colonel. He says they are packed clothes. But they are guns! Shh! Silence! This is not a joke. Anyone here just to pass their time can leave. Anyone from this village can shoot here for a week. [SHOT FIRED] [SHOT FIRED] [SHOT FIRED] [SHOTS FIRED] [SHOT FIRED] There is chance for some more, bro. Babe... I'm the hero of Dandaluru. Would you come out with me? You could be a hero, but you are a married idiot. Think well. I can handle both guns and girls well. Oh wow! Suri... She would one day break your back with the same stick. Rama Rao! Who is this clown? She cleaned you of your marbles in the game back then. Did you forget it? Hey... Goli Raju? Yeah, cry-baby Suri! And why are you so short? Ah! So what? Are you still standing behind women like a coward? Rather than getting disgusted by teasing them, it's better to stand behind them. Yeah, OK. Do you think this is a game of marbles? It's shooting! A man's sport. As I told you, she'd win over you anywhere. - Let's check it out in the competition. - Yeah, sure. - Yeah, let's see. - Let us see then! Of course we shall! What competition? The Colonel is arranging a competition for the best shooter in village. So, you too... Hey... don't involve me into all these things. What do you mean? You mean she will defeat me? Absolutely. Raju! OK, let's make a pact. Would she come with me if I defeat her? OK, let's do it. Hey! What's happening? Hey... you both are messing with me. It's not so easy, Raju. I'll stamp her down. She will stamp your male ego down, wait for it. - Yeah, go play marbles. - Why did you get me into this? - Why? Have you lost your marbles? - Just leave man! Raju! Go to hell. What's the problem there? Go back to work! - Get lost! - Don't forget the competition! What is it? Sakhi... why don't you agree to participate in the shooting competition! - Just leave! - Oh! You are the one with a great aim among us. That's a game of marbles. Whatever it is. All that matters is aim! Already people call me 'Bad luck Sakhi'. If I get into this, I can forget about getting married. Listen, participate in the competition and men will line up in front of your house. And that too if you don't shoot them down. [SAKHI SCOFFS] Not funny. Sakhi... why don't you come to just watch the competition? Not happening! Sakhi! Sit down. Hey grandpa, do I have tell you specially? Just sit down. If you sit quietly for a while... The colonel will come and explain about the competition. Understand? Hmm... Yeah, sir has come. Be seated. Sir, is this only for men? Sorry? Well... Wait, Sakhi... I am asking whether women aren't allowed to participate in this, sir. I didn't say anything like that. In that case, we have a great shooter among us. Who is it? She is the one. - Sakhi, get up. - I won't. - Get up. - I won't. - Get up. - No, I won't. - Get up, Sakhi. - Won't you leave me? No chance. Just get up. Get up. Come on, get up. She is the one, sir. [LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY] He says she is the shooter! Are you really a good shooter? - No. - Tsk! Do you have any experience in shooting? No. Hey, are you fooling around? Listen to me, sir. Just give one chance. Alright. I'll give you ten pellets just like everyone else. No special treatment. Come with me. Sakhi, come. - Just come I say. - No, I won't. Didn't I say no? Here, hold this. Hold it here. Why is this so odd... unlike the conventional guns... - In the movies? - Tsk! Hey... Don't ever hold this gun in that manner. This won't be like those guns which they show in movies. You begin the shooting, I'll watch. How should I? Okay... where should I shoot? Look at the white paper over there. Shoot anywhere on it. Sakhi, look at the black circle in the Center. Shooting on it will fetch more points. - Hmm... - Shoot on it. Put your heart in it, Sakhi. [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] Come on. You really have no experience in shooting? You are lying, aren't you? - Do I seem like a liar? I'm leaving. - Sakhi... - Wait... - Hey... You are going to compete against those three. Eh? Didn't I tell you, sir? [SCOFFS] Is there more shooting? - Look how well your aim was. - Shankar. Suri has been selected as the best shooter in this competition. [LAUGHING] [APPLAUSE] But, another person who scored two points less than Suri has also been selected. That person is Sakhi. [APPLAUSE] I told you, right? [APPLAUSE] I am going to start training them both from tomorrow. You have to perform better in the training. - [OVERLAP OF VOICES] - Hey, hands off me! Hands off! IN UNISON: "Be ready!" IN UNISON: "Be watchful". IN UNISON: "And put it in your pocket... Yeah!" The thing is that... I feel naked if I not wearing long skirts, sir. Alright. Wear the long skirt on the track pants. Okay. But there should be no bangles on your arms. Every gram of weight on your arms would make a difference during shooting. Sit. Hey... You need not sit down, as a matter of respect for just being your teacher. You and I are equal. My duty is to give you good training. Please don't bring these many changes in a single day, colonel. Alright. "My heart is flying around like a colorful butterfly." "My heart is rising like a lightning that's coming from behind the cloud." "I wonder what's in this breeze." "My heart is floating in these colors." "Heave-ho... Heave-ho..." "My happiness is making me sing." "Is this world be so beautiful?" "All these days, my poor heart has been in dark!" "My heart has been overwhelming like night jasmine in the mornings." "My heart is flying like the white cultured kites of kids." "Eyes without dreams have started to show stories of happiness." "The heart that was silent started to experience waves of hope." "Is this world be so beautiful?" "All these days, my poor heart has been in dark!" [MUSIC MUTES VOICE] [MUSIC MUTES VOICE] [MUSIC MUTES VOICE] [GUNSHOTS] - Raju. - Yes. Thank you very much. Why? I thought I would be grinding turmeric roots forever. It is because of you that I have become confident in myself. I will be the happiest, if you are happy. I am immensely happy. Well... Where did you go from the training place yesterday? Do you know how long I have searched for you? That's not the case, Sakhi. There should be absolute silence while I am writing. Only then, I would get creative thoughts. But, we don't talk much! Well... The colonel keeps saying something, and I get distracted while writing. Moreover, what can an artist like me write when there are guns around me. Well... We will meet here, right? Let's keep that going. - Hmm. - Sure. - Let's meet every day. - Hmm. We are going to Hyderabad for shooting competition, next week. You are coming with me, right? Well... How would you even go without me? This is the first time I am going out of my village. There are many places or sightseeing in Hyderabad. - Yes. But don't tell me. - Why not? - Golconda, Birla Mandhir... - Don't tell me. I'll go and visit them. - Don't tell me. I'll go and visit them. - Tank Bund and Lord Buddha's statue in it. - Don't tell me... Don't tell me... - Why? Let me tell you. - [SCREAMS] [MAKING BRONX CHEER] - Lord Budda's statue, airport.. [NO AUDIO] You'll die, rascal! All of you, listen to me carefully. Put your money and gold ornaments in this bag. Else, he will kill us. Ma'am, put them in. This is a very big gun. It can kill many people. Take your possessions out. Come on, put them. Hey, come. [WHISPERS] Hey! If you turn back, I'll kill you, rascal. Go! [SNIFFS] Accept me now, at least. Hey... I've been observing from many days... I've been letting you off but you've been going overboard. I got an opportunity of a lifetime. I won't stay mum if rogues like you... rogues like you ruin it. Understood? Huh? Let go of my hand. Let go of my hand. Let go... Let go, vixen. - What's happening? - [SCREAMS IN PAIN] Nothing, sir. Suri was not letting me do my work. Right, Suri? I was getting my shoulders... massaged. Was he troubling you? It's okay, sir. This rogue is not new to me. [HUMMING] Raju... Raju... [SINGING VERSES] "All the living creatures in all the realms bow to me." Raju... This happens to me every time I enact a play. Where did you go last night, Sakhi? I was in the training camp, Raju. You have stopped meeting me nowadays, Sakhi. You are spending more time with the colonel. This is the fourth time that you haven't showed up despite promising me. Wait until I am done with these competitions, Raju. After that, I'll spend all my time with you. Will you come and meet me today? - Certainly. - Certainly? - Hmm.- Sakhi... You are being called to attend the Panchayat. Why? Don't know. They want your parents to come as well. Sakhi's family has been staying along with us in our village for 28 years. But they hail from Mulakalapalli from Telangana region. Suri just informed me about this. The issue is this... Is it right to send Sakhi, the native of Telangana region... To represent Dandaluru village of Rayalaseema region, in the competition? I've been putting all my efforts to bring a good name to our region. But the outsiders are coming and stealing our glory. What difference does a region make, nitwit? Are you whining about the girl who has been living among us all these years? Hey elder one... What's wrong in Suri's claim? His win would anyway bring a good name to our village, right? What name, my foot? We've been getting some short cricket programe since recently. That's IPL, sir. Yes. I watched that programe when my grandson was watching. My grandson has been applauding for the performance of foreign nation cricketers. When I asked him the reason... He says that those players are playing on the behalf of our Telugu team. Oh elder one, whatever you wanted to convey, put it straight. Well... It is not considered wrong when other nation player plays on our behalf. But what's bothering you when a girl who was born and raised among us... In representing our village, you nitwits? Why should we discriminate amongst ourselves citing regions, Suri? Though there are different dialects, everyone speaks the same language. Aren't we thronging to the theatres to watch the newly released movies? What happened to your sense then? That's not the case, Mr. Reddy. Women going for shooting is not our practice. Mr. Reddy... Out of his incompetency to win this competition... He's trying to stop Sakhi into entering it by making unwarranted allegations. Hey... Mind your words, Raju! Suri, calm down. Aren't we all gathered here to discuss and come to a decision? Continue, Raju. Colonel always keeps telling about an incident. An 84 year old woman, from Uttar Pradesh named Chandro Tomar. Has won the gold medal in 2010 shooting competition. Why are we still clinging to gender discrimination. When such great things are happening around us? How can we do the same just cause those people have allowed it? Tell them. What Raju is saying is true. [MUSIC MUTES VOICE] All of you, be quiet. Be quiet. I have been observing for ten minutes. It's all about what does that guy, this guy and that old man want. You have asked these men what they want. But no one asked me what I want. Alright. What do you want, miss? I will participate in the shooting competition. That's final. All of you have heard what Sakhi said, right? I don't have any objections to send Sakhi to represent our village. Learn to live with honesty. Women are already fighting against many social evils in this society. It is our basic responsibility not to be part of those social evils. Understand? Yes, sir. Nice bike! Where did you get it? Mr. Reddy, gave it to me. Oh! Which bus have you robbed, Suri? Suri? Who the hell is he? Are you here to return the gun? Remove that dirty veil first. How did you even expect that I wouldn't enquire Mr. Reddy about the new bike? Forgive me, sir. I did a mistake. I am giving you one more chance. Return all your plunder at the police station by going there in person. Don't trouble any woman hereafter. I won't, sir. Stop doing these illegal activities and learn to live ethically. Don't you ever show your face to me! Go. Good morning, Colonel. Good morning. It's just the two of us today. Suri wouldn't join us. Why? I came to know that he was the one who robbed the bus. I have already expected that it was that rogue's work. Moreover, he brought those stolen ornaments here and tried to show off. Dirty rogue! Forget about him. We've got only one week time. Let's practice without any disturbance. The three important qualities of a shooter are: Tranquillity. Stability. Concentration. The foremost important quality is... 'Tranquillity'. Waiting contributes to ninety percent of stress during shooting. After you start waiting... The brain will test you for every second. What is it? The second most important quality is... 'Stability.' The pistol that will be provided to you in the competition weighs 1.5 kilograms. You have to accustomed to holding that heavy pistol for a minute during training, It would become easy for you to hold it stably for 45 seconds in the competition. Patience... Patience... Patience... "Like the tri-color flag in the sky, hoist your stare high." "Like the tri-color flag in the sky, hoist your stare high." The third most important thing is... 'Concentration'. "Dreams should flow out of your eyes into reality." "Dreams should flow out of your eyes into reality" [GROANS] Granny! There would be other shooters around you in the competition. When you will be able to block yourself from getting distracted by them... Only then, you will be able to see your target clearly. What are the three important qualities that a shooter should have? Tranquillity, stability and concentration. - What are we used to? - Victory. - Luck is... - Non-existent. - Our fate... - Is in our hands! Good. [MUSIC MUTES VOICE] Shall I eat that as well? "In the heavenly underworld" "...all demons must bow to me" - "That empire..." - Bro... - It's 'Whichever empire...' - [CLEARS THROAT] 'Whatever empire...' 'After receiving my command...' 'It is followed by series of celebrations and su...' - 'It is followed by series of...' - '...celebrations and surprises' 'It is followed by series of celebrations and surprises' 'Hail Ghatotkacha' 'Hail Ghatotkacha' What are you doing? Nothing. Then you are hiding something. Are you taking them to relieve pain? It is unavoidable sometimes. Massaging with medicinal oil will give you relief instantly. It will be healed since I've been taking medicines. But massaging it every day will heal it quicker. I know. I've been using these medicines for a long time. It'll heal... These are the hands that have ground turmeric roots, sir. I understood about them when you twisted Suri's hand, the other day. Right? Then, go and sit there. Just sit there. [MOTORCYCLE APPROACHING] Hey, Raju! Your girl won't come. Who? I am talking about the girl who you have been languishing for eight years. Who told you that I have been sitting here for her? The entire town. So what? It is up to you, dude. No matter how much you wait for her... it is a waste of your time. Taking some liberty, I came here to tell you this. What's this sudden social service attitude which you never had? The colonel has thrown me out of his camp. And now, I don't have any other work. So, I have been eagerly waiting to ruin someone's life. Suri, you are a worthless rogue. And you were one who said this to me. Will anyone take you in instead of casting you out? Do you know why the colonel had thrown me out? He doesn't want me to intrude in their affair. He wants to have private time with her... Listen... Private time. Now, he is the only guy over there. And that makes two of them. Hey... Utter one more word and I'll kill you. See, when you are so pained listening to this... Why don't you go and get her before he takes her away from you? Do I look like a fool to believe the words of rogues like you? Think it over! I am asking for one last time... Do you want a lift? Hey... Bugger off! Look, I hate this kind of blind trust! I hate it to the core! Fine! [STARTS ENGINE] See you. No, Raju. Don't. It is none of your concern. Did Sakhi express her love to you? No. It's her choice whether to be with colonel or anyone. No, Raju. No! [SINGING] Thank you very much, Sakhi. Alright, that's enough. Oh no! I forgot something! I have to meet Raju near the field. Hey... Take some rest as well. Tomorrow is a very important day. - See you, sir. - Okay. Raju! Raju... Raju! Mother, did Raju come here? Yes. He said that he's going to Anantpur to attend to some work. Idiot! He does this all the time. He'd have some work only during important days of mine. [SIGHS] [HONKING] Granny... Enough! Dear... travel safe. Careful, girl! Okay. [TRAFFIC SOUNDS AND HONKING] [VEHICLE STOPS] She is Anjali. She has been the champion for four years. You have to defeat her. Water? Let's go. [SCOFFS] Come. Okay. Yes, coach. Definitely, coach. I'm damn sure we are going to do this. Yes. Excuse me. There are ten more minutes left for the competition to commence. Are you ready? What happened? I'll go home. I can't do all of these. What do you mean? I don't know! I'm uncomfortable with those people. I can't express, Colonel. Are you scared? Hmm. Then, it's fine. You should also learn to utilize your fear. Listen to me carefully. The sounds of guns and the people inside aren't real. What do you mean? You trust me, don't you? More than anyone else. I have more faith in you than that. It is the only truth. And nothing else. Now, close your eyes. Huh? Close your eyes. I believe only one thing. That you will load your equipment with tranquillity. I believe only one thing. That you will be stable and aim that gun.. I believe only one thing. That you will achieve your target with concentration. I believe only one thing. Bull's-eye. Ready? What are those three qualities we need? Tell me, Sakhi. Tranquillity, stability, concentration. Can't hear you. Tranquillity, stability, concentration. Can't hear you. Tranquillity, stability, concentration. Good. - What are we used to? - Victory. - Luck is... - Nothing. - Our fate... - Is in our hands! Good. Good. Come. [INDISTINCT VOICES] What's that? It's nothing. If someone says nothing, then it must be something for sure. Show it to me. Marbles? I consider these marbles as good luck. If I hold it in my hand... What? You said that you don't believe in luck, didn't you? Yes, sir. Then? I have been accustomed to this since childhood. Can you shoot extraordinarily if you hold three marbles? Firstly, trust yourself. Or else, these superstitions. Choose any one thing. Can I touch them once? [SIGHS] - I'll just touch them. - No. Colonel, those marbles bring me good luck. Look... You can't return once you cross that line. You will have to continue living by relying on these marbles. There is no such thing as luck. Our fate is in our hands. Rock it, dear! Rock it, dear! [AIR PISTOL SHOTS] [AIR PISTOL SHOT] [AIR PISTOL SHOTS] [NO VOICE] "Be ready... Be watchful... you won without marbles." Congratulations, you are qualified. National level? Are you serious? Yeah. Come this side. - "Be ready..." - "Be ready..." - "Be watchful..." - "Be watchful..." Show your palms. -"And put it in your pocket" -"And put it in your pocket". That's cute. You played very well. I've been shooting from the past five years. But I've never seen such a talent. Since when have you been taking the training? It's been two months. What? Shucks! The credit goes to Colonel sir. It's true. We should also give some credit to our coaches in our victory. - Good job, sir. - Thank you. Not now. I'll give you a hard time in finals. Let's see. Take care, girl! I'll keep an eye on you. Practice tomorrow at 6:00 am. Let's also start our practice from tomorrow morning. But there is another surprise for you now. Come with me. "My heart has been overwhelming like night jasmine in the mornings." "My heart is flying like the white coloured kites of kids." "My eyes never had a dream..." "But now I see stories unfold." "My heart never felt this way." "Waves of hope in my heart have begun." "Would this world be so beautiful?" "All these days, my poor heart has been in dark!" [MUSIC MUTES VOICES] "Did they bring down the palace from heaven to this room..." "And gave it a few touches?" "I know about magic and chants..." "May be this is different from both?" "May be the sky would look like this, if it had come down to earth?" "To blanket this happiness..." "May be I would need hundred more hearts." "Would this world be so beautiful?" "All these days, my poor heart has been in dark!" Thank you! Get me some chilled water, please. Sit down. [WHIMPERS] From now, your position is this. You won that. It's okay, sit down. Sakhi... This is... Shooting is not the only thing that I've learnt in all these days, Colonel sir. I think I have nothing leftover to teach you. I should learn a lot to be with you. Colonel sir, can I ask you something? Of course, ask me. Why aren't you married yet? Whatsoever it is, army is my first love, Sakhi. Yeah... that's alright. Now, tell me the truth. I didn't find the right girl. I'm also thinking the same. But? Alright, don't get irritated. How do you expect your wife to be? - Sakhi... - This is my last question. But what is the rule that there should be a wife? Oh no! Do you mean single? Maybe, what's wrong in it? Alright. I don't mind whatever happens to me. Then where would you live after you grow old? I've decided to use my mouth to eat. Then I'll be patient until you eat. Okay. Why is it now? I will be patient if this is the case. Patience... Patience... Patience. Will you stay the same? I will be like this until you answer me. For what may time it may take. Let's see. You know that I've more patience, don't you? Anyway, you are my teacher, isn't it? Do you remember that you are my student? Have you heard about the saying 'A student outperforming the teacher'? Is it? Of course! Here, hold this bow with your left hand like this. - Hmm. - Give me the arrow. - By aiming the arrow like this. - Then. - Pull the bow's drawstring back. - Then. Look at me once. What is it, brother-in-law? Nothing. - By pulling it back further... - Then... - By pulling it back further... - By pulling it back further... Hey, stop it. Hey! Remove your hand. I'm removing Sasirekha's character. Mayabazar is nothing without Sasirekha in it. Hell with it! I used to think about re-writing the history, changing the story of 'Mayabazar' isn't tough for me. Hey! [CLEARS THROAT] Hey! Don't disturb me for some time. Bro, I've something to say. The name of the disease that you are experiencing now is emotional anguish. Could you please tell me what it is, sir? I meant, don't ruin Sasirekha due to being angry on someone else. Stop... Stop... Raju. Raju, I have passed. I'm going to the finals in the next month. I already know that you'd win, Sakhi. Yeah, Raju. You already knew it. Where were you on that day? Do you know that I searched a lot for you? I had a small work on that day, that's all. I shot very well. - You should've watched it, Raju. - Ouch! - Alright, let's go. - To where? The panchayat is celebrating the arrival of the Queen me. Oh! I've rehearsals, Sakhi. Tsk! It can be scheduled for tomorrow. Now we are going, that's it. - Hey, listen! I'll change my dress. - Make it fast. Raju! Come soon. What is it? Hailing from our Dantuluru village and for excelling in shooting competition, Let's congratulate Sakhi who is leaving to Banglore to participate in the finals. Everyone, give her a big round of applause. "Like a racing wave in a river..." "Never give up." "Don't stall don't stop..." "Before you cross the boundaries." "Don't give up, make your presence felt." "How long would you wait..." "To rule over the skies?" - Hello. - Hi, how are you? Very well. Thanks. - How are you? - Got a call from you after so long. I have some work with you after a long time. My student needs some help. You always need my help. Sakhi! Dr. Ruksana. Pleasure meeting you, Sakhi. Colonel told a lot about you. How do you know each other? She is my old friend. Dr. Ruksana is a sports psychologist. She determines if the players have the mental strength to win the competitions. But you said that I'd win. I believe what you say. Of course, I did. But we should be careful as it is state-level. It's your tea time. No, this is important. Sit down. - Okay, ready? - Hmm. I will show you some pictures now. You should tell me what you feel when you see it. - Okay? - Hmm. Two women are fighting for a man. And? Hmm... This woman is staring with eyes wide open waiting for the chance to take him away. What do you see here? Don't mess with me. And? I won't let you have him. And here? I don't know. Think properly for once, Sakhi. [SIGHS] Sit down. What's happening, Sakhi? I know very well what you think of me. No need to be shy. Turn this side. I said turn this side, Sakhi. You are not in love with me. You have respect for me but not love. - Do you understand? - Uhuh. Alright. You feel that I brought a change in your life. Is that true? I teach new things to you. How to become a champion, how to shoot, and how to have a meal with fork and knife? You are spending most of your time with me rather than others. I like your tea. You prepare it very well. You are treating me well as I am important to you. Did you understand? You are a great student and I am a good teacher. Ours is the best teacher-student combination. Do you know the reason? Why is it? You respect me. And I respect you. That's the reason. I knew it long back. No, dear. You don't know. Do you remember what you did with Dr. Ruksana? I'm repeating you, Sakhi. The feelings that you have for me is not love. You are confused between love and respect. Do you understand what I am saying? I shouldn't have behaved so with the doctor. But I know what's on my mind. Look Sakhi, I'm 50 years old and you are 25 years old. Look at the difference. 25 years. Which means, I joined the army even before you were born. I'm that older to you. Then you should respect the elders, shouldn't you? Sakhi, you should love your elders but not in this way. I have a word. Tell me. It's time for the tea. Should I add ginger or not? Add whatever you like. I will add a pinch of respect as well. Unlike district championship, state championship has electronic targets. The last round results are counted in decimals. So, a millimeter difference is enough... to decide our win or defeat. Practice! Practice! Practice! [AIR PISTOL SHOTS] [CLEARS THROAT] Raju... You couldn't come for one day too, isn't it? I know, I am unable to spare anytime for you. Once I finish this championship, I will be there with you for your every drama. Lately, I can't believe your words! Raju, do I look like a lair to you? - I didn't mean that. - But you just said that. You are talking just like that colonel. You always keep chanting his name. - Yeah, now I get it. - What's that? You are jealous of Colonel. Yes, I am! So what? What's wrong in talking like him? I'm learning new aspects and getting aware of the world around. Isn't that good? Yeah, he's a great man and we are country men and useless fellows! Yes, indeed you all are! Hey, what are you even talking? But I love you the most! Words like 'Love you the most' mean a lot for people like us. Look, stop sulking! I know what a great actor you are. Very soon the public will also realise the same. - Goli Raju! - Tsk! - I mean... Mr. Rama Rao! - Don't call me by that name. - Which name? Goli Raju or Rama Rao? - Both! Fine. Forgive me! Why are you being very stubborn today? - If you act like this, I'd leave. - Yeah, you better do that. Raju, think before you utter a word. Once I leave, you'd say' Sakhi, please don't go, I can't live without you' Oh, no way I'd say that! You definitely will! Let's see! Look, I am asking for the last time, Later there'd be no pleading, mind it. Fine, go to hell! [TELUGU SONG PLAYING] - [HUMMING] [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] - Guess, who is in the audience tonight... - Who? Casting Ramanna! You mean the one who casts actors in the movies? - Yes, it's him. - I don't believe! - Come and see for yourself! Come. - Hey wait... Bro, there he is! That's him. Heard that he is in the plan of doing a remake of Mayabazaar with new artists. - Is it? - Yes bro. He was told someone acts terrifically in the role of Ghatotkacha. That's why he's here to see the performance. This is amazing Chanti! Such opportunities will never knock your door again. You just kill it! - Yeah, keep that in mind! - Yes, let's go. [CROWD APPLAUDING] Hail Leader! [IN UNISON] [RECITES A POEM IN THE ACT] [CONTINUES TO RECITE A POEM] - Hail Leader! [IN UNISON] - Greetings. Son, didn't I tell you to refrain from doing this? Whom are you waging a war at now? Mother! There's no war now. I am just preparing them for it. The only thing I hate is betrayal. Those who betrayed their own ones, and who have put us through turmoil... and who caused us grief... - Do they organise this every week? - Yes, two times a week. Who caused us grief... Are the Kauravas! I will not spare them! - Err... - Oh I see... Mother... Err... - He was performing well until now... - Yes, I too don't get what went wrong. Damn! - What happened Raju? - All of this happened because of you! What are you talking about? I don't understand! Sakhi, everything was fine until you came. But it doomed after you came! - I get that you are angry now... - I'm not talking about tonight. I said, my life has doomed after you entered in it. You might be angry, but how could you say such a bitter words? Bitter words? You are not new to ruining other's life. I can't believe that it's you, who is talking like this. That is why people call you 'Bad luck Sakhi' Have it brother! Bottoms up! - I knew it. - This is our hood! I knew this as well. Hey, is it mandatory that you should be involved in every mishap in the town. Stop blabbering and pick up the glass! Do it bro. Raju, I never thought you are this timid! Come on have it! Have it! Come on! Pick up and sip it! Come on! Have it! [CHUCKLES] Suri, your villainism is that of a junior artist. Those who come run chasing after the main villain screams 'Attack!' That is you! - Me? - Of course! But I am like... ...a villain who bashes the star heroes. Do you even know what kind of things I indulge into? Stop it man! Mixing sand in Reddy's mirchi powder, taking Sakhi's pistol and. - That is turmeric man! - Oh come on, that doesn't matter. Mixing sand in Reddy's Turmeric powder, taking Sakhi's pistol and looting the bus. Cheating on your wife with illicit affairs. Cheating people with fraud chits. These are very old ones Suri! Oh my goodness! You mean I haven't indulged into any stupidity lately? Hmm! - Yeah, I now remember! - What? I tricked Jyothi and robbed the money she saved for her father's operation. And started the toddy shop here with that. Could there be any cruel villianism that this? Damn! That's all? Villainism is very easy! Very easy! Here... I chided my Sakhi saying 'Bad luck Sakhi' Bad... Is that a scolding? Of course! In fact it's a cuss word! I broke her confidence and her heart at one shot. [SIGHS] I am the best villain! There can't be another best villain than me. The one, whom I was madly in love with... Do you get this? I ruined the trust of the one, whom I was madly in love with. I killed the love she had on herself! Fine, Raju you are the best villain! You won! [CHUCKLES] I won! [GROANS] [BIRDS CHIRPING] [ROOSTER CROWING] [CROW CAWS] [COW MOOS] [CUCKOO COOS] [CAR ENGINE RUNNING] [CAR HONKS] Dear... Here... Your bag! Whatever happened has happened! We'd get another chance for sure. Please forget all these and get ready for Matinee show! Bro! Brother... Audience are restless. Still you are not ready. Damn this guy. He would never pay heed. I'm coming dude. Welcome to Telangana and Andhra Pradesh Air Pistol Championship. Everything has doomed after you came. Ruining other's life is nothing new to you. That is why everyone calls you 'Bad luck Sakhi' [REHEARSING LINES FROM THE ACT] I didn't come for that. Sir, the act didn't go well last night. If you give me another chance, I'd prove my talent. You need not prove Raju! I came here to tell that you are chosen. - Sir... - Yeah... Though your performance was short, I could notice your talent. Are you ready for 'Action... Cut'? - Thank you sir. - Don't thank me, thank Colonel! - Colonel? - Yes! Your colonel and our producer are friends it seems. He himself called last night and told that... 'We have a talented actor here in our town, please go and check out' That's why I came down. By the way, he has girl student... Her name is... - Sakhi... - Yeah Sakhi! She was persistent that you are a great actor and made colonel call. Yes. Change your costumes, we'll start to Hyderabad. Okay. This is impossible! [GROANS] Don't tell me I used Fevicol instead! Hey Raju... Raju... - Sir... - Where are you going? My Sesirekha is in trouble. I need to save her. Suri... Suri... Hey get up! Get up man! - Duryodhana? - Hey, this is Ghatotkacha costume! Hey where is my pouch? - Which pouch? - Marbles pouch. Sorry Duryodhana, that bag belongs to my friend Raju. You idiot! I am Raju! Suri, give me the bag. Hey, my dear friend Raju! Wow, what a friendship! First give me the pouch! I have to go! One moment... - Hey... - What? How are you planning to go in this costume? I have no time for that. I have to rush! You'll get tanned! Here wear this. Hey how about this? Damn this cycle! Hey, I guess my moped is better than your cycle in times like this. Let the tournament begin. In this qualification round, each player is given 60 pellets for 75 minutes. As per my estimation, Anjali is going to win. I say this as I witnessed the district level competitions I have huge expectations on Sakhi. Atheletes... To the lane! Your 15 minutes, preparation and sighting time starts now. No one is pulling over! - Hey Raju... - What man? - Don't mind me asking... - Hmm... I heard that Ghatothkacha has a lot of powers. Why don't you fly to Hyderabad? Ha ha... Very funny! Idiot! What are you man! Grandpa, could you please drop me till Hyderabad? Son, I have to sit beside window. I have vomiting sensation. I too have the same problem, I too have to sit by the window. No problem, I will sit in the middle. - What Devadasu, is that OK? - Yes. [TIMER BEEPING] Shoot! [SHOOTING] - I think Sakhi is struggling a little. - Yeah she is. Almost a few months back, we have seen Sakhi doing wonders. But today she doesn't seem to be focused. If we analyse the current situation, her chances of not qualifying ...seem to be high! - Ouch! - [GRANNIES VOICE MUTED] Grandpa, why don't you pace up? Is it? Will a 70 do? Yeah... please! [PISTOL COCKING] [SHOOTING] [APPLAUSE] It's time for the finals let's go. How many times should I tell you? I am not in love with you. I've been trying to tell this from the past 2 months in all ways possible. You are very sharp in grasping everything except this. Why? Look Sakhi, I am not in love with you. Neither you are. All you have towards me is only respect, not love. They both are different. I can lie to you that I love you, and send to the game. But my conscience doesn't permit. Raju was right! I am indeed 'Bad luck Sakhi' Don't say such things! I told you umpteen times, no such thing exists. Why do you keep reiterating it? What else do you expect me to say about my fate? I lost all that mean a lot me in one day. All my life has been the same. Stop it Sakhi, stop this melodrama. Sakhi, every one will face bad times. The only thing I love more than myself is Army. I lost all of it because of one stupid bullet. But I haven't lost my hopes on my life. - You have a lot of courage. - Crap! If you didn't have that courage, I wouldn't have wasted my time for you. True Colonel Sir, you have wasted a lot of time. Now I plead you, please take me back to my town. - Is that all you want? - Yes! Okay. No! Not OK. No Sakhi. We didn't work hard all these days and come till here to believe some crap called luck and go back. We are going for the finals. It's up to you, whether you shoot the target or yourself there! We started this together, let's also finish this together. Come! [GRUNTS] Leave me! - I am disgusted with you! - Good! I too want that! Now all you need is Peace... Stability and Concentration. Final eight members should report in five minutes. Elimination round begins now. Did you see that? Sakhi has shooted outside the electronic target. Yeah Mr. Anil, I too can't believe it. It's unbelievable! - Yeah! Okay... - His joints are frozen due to arthritis. He can't get down. You can get down from this side. - Okay, alright grandma. - I'll race to get down. [GROANS] Could you please get down fast... Wait son. I have joint pains. [GROANS] Grandmas and Grandpas thank you so much! If Sakhi has to qualify... she must shoot all the remaining shots perfectly above 10.7. Also, only if Priya who is the least scorer, misses two pellets. Welcome to Telangana and Andhra Pradesh state air pistol championship. - Sir... - Why are you here Raju? - And what's this strange attire? - Sir, it's a long story. Where is Sakhi, sir? There... she is spoiling all our toil of so long. Can I try talking to her once? No one is allowed on to the shooting floor unless it's an emergency. This is an emergency, sir. Please. - Okay, go talk to him. - Okay. Hey! See that? [LAUGHS] Did you see that? As if Sakhi's performance was not bad enough, there's another miracle happening. Yama himself is walking on to the shooting floor. Sir... can I meet the girl number 17? No. You shouldn't come here. It's against the rules. It's a life and death issue, sir. Please understand. It's an emergency! Please sir... - Please sir... - Okay, but only for a minute. Thank you, sir. Thank you. You've ruined my trust. What else are you here for? I came to give these to you. I did a mistake beyond pardon. It was disgusting. Your life is in your hands now. Not for me, the village or Colonel. Think about yourself. Prove to this world what is a woman capable of if she thinks about herself. Mr. Bhaskar, I have never witnessed such a weird shooting competition in my life! [BOTH LAUGH] Well, I'm scared to look that way, sir. Okay. - Sir... - Yeah... - What happen? - What could happen? Wait... wait... wait. Something is happening. Yes! Did you see that? - Wow! - Yes! Sakhi met the huge expectations on her as you said. Her last eight shots were too good! Priya is the one who is eliminated from the first round. By tenth of a decimal. [APPLAUSE] Yes! I told you sir... They are her good luck marbles. Final two, Okay? She'll do it. Yes! - Last one sir. - Yes, last one. Why she is not shooting? 'There is nothing called Good luck.' 'If you cross that line once, you cannot return again' 'You will have to live believing on these marbles' Sir... what is she doing? - Yes! Yes! - Yes! She did it! - Yes! - She won the tournament sir. "We challenge you... check us out! Stack them up all in your pocket." Sakhi has bagged it at last! Yes, sir. You shot well. Raju... I won, Raju. I knew you would win, Sakhi. You know everything, Raju. Colonel sir... I spoke wrong without thinking earlier... Good job! Good job. Sakhi Pamar... Go... - You are the reason for all of this, sir. - No, Raju. It's all her talent. Hey... Congratulations! You played well too. See you at the nationals. I hope you know to remove the crown! Well... What actually happened was. I mistook Fevicol for gum in the rehearsals and... Oh! How much I try to remove it... Uhuh! [COLONEL LAUGHS] Would you marry me? How many times do I tell you, Sakhi? Not you, Colonel sir. I meant the Ghatotkacha who is over reacting there. Ghatot... Only you recognised me as Ghatotkacha. My Grandma always told me that a Prince would come and change my fate. And am I that Prince? You are too stupid sometimes. I know that you love me a lot. A lot. But Colonel sir and you... Even I thought so. But love is different from respect! Isn't it the truth, Guruji? Now would you remove the 'Bad luck' from my name? Okay. "If you focus your heart and soul on the target." "Our's... The victory is our's." "If you let go of your fears." "Our's... The success is our's." "Than the entire world." "Our India is the best." "Than the entire world." "Our India is the best" [CAMERA CAPTURES] [MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS PLAYING] Look, your Prince charming has arrived! Hey you... Light it up! [CRACKERS BURSTING] [HORSE NEIGHING] [HORSE NEIGHING] - Hey, are we out of danger? - Yeah! - Uncle... - Raju is here... - Colonel Sir... - Congrats Raju! Come on start the music! [ORCHESTRA PLAYS] We have overcome all the barriers Sakhi! "Is this world so beautiful?" "My poor heart didn't know that for so long!" "My heart has been overwhelming like night jasmine in the mornings." "My heart is flying like the white coloured kites of kids." "My eyes never had a dream..." "But now I see stories unfold." "My heart never felt this way." "Waves of hope in my heart have begun." "Is this world so beautiful?" "My poor heart didn't know that for so long!" [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Hey! What are you writing? 'Dana Veera Sura Karna' play. Granny... Where is Sasi? I didn't see! Manga, did you see? - I didn't mother-in-law. - But I asked you to look after. Me? When did you give me? - What? - Mister... Where is the girl? - I did not see, how would I know? - Goodness! Go search for her. [AIR PISTOL SHOT]
