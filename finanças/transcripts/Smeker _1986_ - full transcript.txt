That's the way I like you, son. Be there for a few minutes. This one, isn't, this one neither. It has to be this. Let's mix them now. - I saw which one is. - It's not that. Don't do that. - This one. - Another. First cash, then shoot. - This one. - I don't want to play with army, - Soldier, you don't have money. - Who, me? Ok, good. You won. We'll give you the payout. Svabo, what are you staring at? Here, drink something, soldier. I took it from you now and I always will. - Here we go again. - See? He stepped on the right one, right on time. Svabo?

Rules of service strictly forbid for soldiers to ride with foreign registration plates and to take money, pussy and sweets. On provocative questions the answer is: Neither I'm hungry nor thirsty. Yugoslav People's Army provides us everything in large amounts and right on time! Do you have something to change my clothes? Let me hear it. - Say what you have to. - What's with you? Son... As if yesterday you left... You can't destroy them all, you fool. Stop. You look great as a soldier. - You're great. - Where's Lela? I don't know.

I'll scream. - C'mon. Scream. Please stop. She went to the hospital to see her mum. Where's Lela? - Wait. She's with some guy. - Which guy? - Nesa. - Fagot. - He's not fagot. He's an art photographer. - Since when? I don't know. I see them together. Why didn't you say it in the first place? Why are you joking with me? I almost slapped you. - Why didn't you? - Why didn't I? Get lost! Pavel... Pavel. - How's there? - Why do you even ask? And you? How are you? A little restless. I have to be. - You came to visit home. - Yes. Sit down, son, sit. Have a grapefruit. - If you could make me a klaker. - I will. - Good one. - Good. - Do you need some money? - Thank you uncle Daco, I have it. You have? Good. - I'm going. - Wait, where? Sit a little while. Why don't you stay a little? Where are you going if I may ask? I'm going to wander around a bit. I wasn't here for a long time. Go. What's up bro! Did your dick grow? Who do you screw there in the army? As soon as I saw Lela's picture I knew you would ran away from the quarters. Hey, what's that noise? There's no one here. Go away. - What now? - We'll wait. Pavle, I'm getting married. On Sunday. Will you come? This is my future wife. Scheherazade. You promised you will take care of Lela. I saw her with some guy... - Why didn't you kill her? - I would if she was mine. - Why didn't you inform me if you knew? - I couldn't. You're my friend, Suki. You promised. I'm a Gypsy, pal, the most handsome one. They would all go against me, they all think I'm an asshole. Better go home. Change clothes, kiss your mother and family. Then come back. - Don't, Pavel! - You fagot, motherf... - Don't do it, please! Nothing happend, I swear. Leave him be, it's not his fault. Beat her. You shouldn't have done it, you knew I was in army. - Go to his place. - Leave him. Go to his place. What's that noise? I'll call the police! This vandal wanted to rape his girl. What's with you Pajo, nothing happened. I swear. Are you crazy, you'll kill me. I waited for you. Run before I kick your ass. Neighbour? Do you need help? Pavel... Pavel. Not a word. Don't Pajo, please. Please don't. Don't make a whore out of me, please. Please, Pajo. Please, I don't deserve it. Don't please. Don't please. Stop, wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Calm down. Calm down. It's useless what you're doing. Cool down. Calm down. C'mon. - What's this in my room? - We're renting it. - That's my room. Where will I sleep? - Stop yelling! You're in army, if you ask us. You don't give a damn about me. As if I died. How could you? Every brick is mine. Mine! What do you think, how do I get money that I send you every month? - From rent, you evil prick. - You hardly waited for me to leave. You don't give a damn about me, huh? You're evil! Fuck your dominoes! - You've ruined the house. - Leave your father alone. I won't. Home is going down while he jerks the dominoes. He fucked up all the money on gambling. Pavle.

Disappeared from the quarters "Brotherhood and Unity" in Tetovo, at night between 22nd and 23rd of May. He left the guard place on his own which is... He didn't come home, I don't know where he is. I have to warn you that hiding of a deserter is punishable by law. If Pavle Ivkovic comes here, he has to raport to the city command. If not, we wil have to enforce the law. I understand, general. Goodbye, comrade. Yawn, you just yawn. You want me to drive you to Lela? Daco. It's you. I need money. Yes. You want... something? "kabeza"? - Pavle came. - I know. And Suki's wedding is on Sunday. How much do you need? God, Daco. You always ask the same. How much? A lot. You know better than I. Wait here. - Rado. - Hm? Kiss me. Why would I kiss you? Why would elders kiss? I want... you to kiss me, Rada. In my mouth. There. I can't live like this anymore. I can't. I can't stand it anymore. Come live with me. Live them there. Don't be silly, old man. I live only for you and Pavel. I told you a hundred times not to call him like that. Now everybody call him Pavel. He's my son. - He's my son. You know that. Confess. - Don't speak rubbish old man. I know he's my son. I know that by this birthmark here. He has a birthmark on the eyebrow. I know him by that. My uncle Edvard who lives in Israel, he has that same birthmark. Don't lie Daco. I know this picture. Your uncle never had white eyebrow. You scratched the picture, Daco... You made a bithmark. I did. But he's my son after all. Will you give me the money or not? This is a spare key of the shop. Give it to Pavel if he wants to continue my job. Here is the authorization. I'm leaving tommorow. Don't joke with me Daco. You've been talking about leaving for Israel for 10 years One word from you and I will withdraw. Huh? Maybe Pavel is in fact my son? - Maybe... - Maybe, Daco. Who would know...
