Well, in the past, the river was very beautiful. Many years ago. The Colorado River was full then. A lot of water. There was a lot of fish. A lot of big-mouth fish, a lot of grey mullets... A lot of fish. But then it dried up and we had to go... All the fish died. It drained, that's it. People have come saying, "Yes, of course we are going to release water, so the river is going to have water." Though they never came back. And when they say, "We are going to release water", it's a lie! There is no water anymore.

Dry, dry. Imperial Valley, California, 11,608 KM2 Hazaribagh Tannery District, Dhaka Our leather is not sold here in Bangladesh. It is all for export. Rafikul Islam Sarkar Our leather goes to Italy, Germany, China, Hong Kong, and the U.S. It goes to Canada too. Our biggest market is Europe and the U.S. We use a lot of chemicals in processing the hides. Soda ash is used for cleaning, as well as detergent. We use chemicals in liming also. Nothing happens without chemicals in any stage of tanning. Chromium is used to tan the hides. Leather tanneries need water. No job here is done without water, a lot of water. Every stage requires one to two thousand litres of water. The wastewater flows into the Buriganga River. Stikine River Watershed, Northern B.C., 52,000 KM2 Oscar Dennis Abalone Farms, Luoyuan Bay, East China Sea Do you have abalones with the green head? There aren't any. Check if they have some. I will make a fortune by selling these. How much will that be? - 109.8! - How could it be so light? You've got a bad scale. The women are complaining about being tired. We can get our money at the pier. There are eight of us. Or I can pay you in the next two days. We get our money right after we finish work. What should we make for lunch? Catch a fish. Some sea snails. Put the sea snails into the water. I'll do that. You come here and cut the carrot. Let me cook. I didn't put much salt in the dish. So what? Just a little salt. It's fine not to put much salt into seafood. Because our abalone are grown in the sea, we have to grow them densely. If we grow them sparsely, we'll be risking everything in typhoons. Lin Jianqing So we tie all the farms together which benefits everyone. For example, if an anchor snapped and fell to the bottom of the sea, it will still be held by the others, and won't float away. If one is isolated, when a typhoon hits, the anchor snaps and it just floats away. There's not going to be anyone to help. It's like walking with a friend. If you trip and fall, your friend can pull you up. It's reciprocal. That's why you see those lots lined up on the sea. But eventually, whether it's our farms, our houses, the environment here... nothing lasts forever. National Ice Core Laboratory, Denver - 35 degrees Celsius Greenland Ice Sheet 1,710,000 KM2 J.P.

Put on your safety helmet everybody. Turn on the TV. This routine is called "Talking About Tiger in the Year of the Tiger", performed by Niu Wei and Feng Gong. The mountains on both riverbanks are relatively strong. They are solid basalt. Because of them, the arch dam can support a load of 10.4 million tons of water. What is a double curved arch dam? Zhou Shaowu Actually it is what you have seen. It is an arc shape stretching from the left bank to the right bank. And viewing a cross-section of the middle, it is also an arc vertically. It is like a curve this way, and this way as well. So we call it a double curved arch dam. Xiluodu's power generation capacity is 13.86 million kilowatts. The Hoover is 2.07 million kilowatts. Thus, Xiluodu Dam's capacity will be about six times that of the Hoover's. Keep going. Down. Down. Down, a bit more. I am going to walk down there. Is it safe? Is it OK to walk down there? It's very noisy out here, isn't it? Yes, so noisy. Done. Good.

Zhengliang Luo We use a piece of carved wood to distribute the water to each family. Because the water is shared by many households, it happens quite often that a family's water could get stolen. These two plots, and that one over there, belong to my family. Bai Yunfei That one belongs to us, too. I sit and watch other people... and see if they do anything suspicious. I am a water guard. Yes, I'm outside. My sister has gone up. My family has been growing rice for generations. More and more people nowadays leave home to find work instead of staying home to grow rice. The work is too hard. I want to visit other places. Beijing - Look at these lights. Maha Kumbh Mela, Allahabad This is the Prayagraj, king of all the pilgrimages.

Some are due to our actions, some due to our mind, and some due to our feelings. To destroy all these sins, we bathe in the Ganges so all our sins are washed away. Brothers and sisters.
