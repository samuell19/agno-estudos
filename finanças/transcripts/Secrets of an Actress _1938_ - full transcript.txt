Could I see Mr Carstairs please? - Have you an appointment, dear? No, but .. - Sorry. You'll have to wait. Well, I guess six months' steady work is worth waiting for. W.P. Carstairs. Hello, Joe. For the love of Mike where is that Carter dame? What? She hasn't gotten there yet? She must have been caught in a traffic jam. She left here over half an hour ago. We might as well tell him. - Now be a little patient, Bill. She'll be along any minute, old man. So long. Don't be an idiot, Fay. It's a good show. A swell part. A road company. But you can knock the spots off Dolores Stone's performance. In Sioux City. Your father wasn't ashamed to play Sioux City. Well, neither am I. But I just don't want to. I have played it. I was carried on in my mother's arms. I was little Eva in Sioux City. I've done Desdemona to my father's Othello in Sioux City. I love it. I've done every other one-night-stand from Portland Maine to San Diego. Why, I've brought down the house in places no-one heard of. Except the post office department. But my dear Fay, don't you realize? Yes, I know. The same old routine. Have a nice safe job on the road. I work for a reasonable salary. My father's name was an asset but that is not true now. My father's name doesn't mean a thing. It died with him. That's not so, Fay. There are plenty who remember what a fine actor he was. Yes. I know. A few old-timers who knew him when he was still a great actor. Before he took to annual farewell tours because he was too poor to retire. And don't forget this, Joe. There isn't any road anymore. What was 'The road' is now a double-feature movie .. A newsreel and a travelogue on a Friday night. No. I am either going to see my name in lights in New York or .. Or quit the profession entirely. What else could you do? Well. I suppose I could be a wardrobe mistress. That is still backstage. Come on now, Fay. Be a good scout. Take this part in Carstairs' show. You may as well draw a salary while we're looking for something better. I can wait. I've got about $3,000 saved up. Alright. Hold on to it. And in the meantime .. It's no use, Joe. I'm not going to leave New York. It isn't as if I were some stagestruck girl that thinks she is an actress. I was born in the theater. I was taught my profession and I know my job. And I am thirty years old, Joe. Six years on the wrong side. I can't afford to wait. Neither now or never. I wish I could be more encouraging. What will I tell Carstairs? Tell him the road is dead. Fay Carter helped to kill it. And she has no intention of returning to the scene of the crime. Goodbye, Joe. I'll phone you tomorrow. [ Female scream! ] Marian. Did you scream? Yes, sir. - What's the matter? You rapping the door frightened me. And when I am frightened I scream. I'm no hypocrite. Anything happen today? - A big day. I turned down the lead in the road company of 'Tenderly Yours'. You did? Uhuh. - Ha! And how long do you think $3,000 is going to last in $150-a-month apartment? With you buying clothes as if the government was paying the bills. Any telephone calls? The phone rang but you scared it away. [ Telephone ] Hello? Yes, Mr Thompson. I will see if she will talk with you. Thompson and Harrison's office. Don't be too anxious. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Hello, Mr Thompson. Fine, thank you. Oh, you saw me in Rochester. Is that so? Thank you so much. He saw me in Rochester and said I was .. I beg your pardon? In half an hour. Goodbye. What is it? The lead in 'Aftermath'. Harrison's new show. You mean you've got it? No. I have got to read it. Then you have got it. Wait a minute, wait a minute. For good luck. - Thanks. I pretended to read. Hoping to drop off to sleep. When I raised my eyes .. They were still looking at me. He had never taken his eyes off of me. Poor Bill. He tried so hard to smile. But couldn't make it. Dear. Dear sweet Bill. Laughing at his own jokes again. Alright Miss Carter. Tomorrow morning at ten o'clock at The Empire. Is that the rehearsal call? - Yeah. But what about the old man? It's in the bag. Miss Carter is going to play the part. She's perfect. It was written for her. I'll take care of Harrison. Thank you. But I tell you she's a great actress. She will be a sensation. She'll have them cheering in the aisles. Not interested. - Now look, Mr Harrison. She's exactly what I imagined this girl would be like. If I had tried to write a part for her I couldn't have done it any better. Don't mean a thing, boys. Times are hard. Show business is a gamble. I know Mr Harrison but this girl is an actress. Look the only protection I have is the name in the lead. And I am going to have that even if I have to go to Hollywood to get one. And don't be too eager. Just take your time. - Yes, dear. How do I look? Divine. Well, here goes Fay Carter. Funny, isn't it. I Knew something would happen. It just had to. Of course, dear. You are entitled to it. Now run along. Run along and .. And .. If there's a part for you I'll see that you get it. Thank you, dear. Your bag and gloves, my lady. Thank you, Jeeves. [ Telephone ] Hello? Just a minute please. Thompson. Hello? Yes. This is Miss Carter. Well, I am sure that you do all that you could. Thank you. What? Oh yes. Yes. Thank you. Goodbye. Well .. you heard. I've lost the part. They say I am too sophisticated to pay a milkmaid. At least it's saved me the cab fare. 'I will keep you in mind'. Well he is telling you. You. He'll keep you in mind. Who does he think he is talking to? By what right? It's all my fault, darling. I didn't kick you hard enough. I let sentiment interfere with my duty. Fay. Do you need a drink? Why? For not getting that part. Now. That calls for a celebration. Marian, that doesn't sound logical. In an hour everything will sound wonderfully logical. Now come on, Fay. Your soul aches with disappointment. Your nerves are snapping. Your spirits are low. Your courage is weak. You need a drink, Fay. You need a drink. Almost as badly as I do. Come on, darling. I'll be ready in a jiffy. Another brandy. - Marian, you have had three. We are depressed, Fay. Very depressed. We need to drink our sorrows away. We need jobs. - We are not broke. It isn't the money. It's just that being idle does something to one. I guess I had better take that roadshow offer. Oh, no you won't. If the dust storms don't get you the double-features will. Another brandy. I am still untouched. My man, you annoy me. Please go away. - So sorry. My man, I .. - Let's go home. A Plantagenet never retreats. I told you. - You annoy me. Will you please leave us alone. The lady has only to comment. Marian! You shouldn't allow drunks into respectable places. Are you hurt? Well, she packs a mean wallop. I'm terribly sorry. - That's alright. I think she has passed out. - That is absurd. It's quite final. What am I going to do now? Has she got a home? - Of course she has got a home. I am sorry. Well, we had better take her to it. Here we go. I never should have let her drink. She can't take it. Three or perhaps four and she passes out. She'll be alright. Peter Snowden. - Fay Carter. Miss Marian Plantagenet. Ah. Is she your mother? If that doesn't shock her into consciousness nothing will. Sorry. Sister? No. Just an old friend. Ever since I can remember. Architect. Actress. Oh? What have you been in? Nothing on Broadway. Everything on the road. What sort of architect are you? I've built an 80-storey building but I am afraid to go in it. You want a fight? - Wait a second. Wait a minute. No. Not particularly. Do you know .. I was a college boxing champion? Marian, how do you feel? - What? It's me, Fay. If you want receipts. Write your conscience. Dear boy. Right in here please. Plantagenet. Now, would you mind waiting in the ..? Oh, sure. I can't thank you enough. - Are you Henry Carter's daughter? Yes. Well for years, Henry Carter was the great event of my life. Did you know him? - I played with him. Where? In Rutland, Vermont. - I played Ophelia in Rutland. Of course you did. My father owned the drugstore. I was one of the soldiers who helped carry off Hamlet. I was the soldier whose voice was changing. You don't by any chance remember? No. Voices changed on us in every town we played. Oh yes, I suppose so. Won't you sit down? - Thanks. You ought to have your own company like your father. And get lost in the jungle of one-night-stands? Not me. It's out of New York or not at all. - Hollywood? I'll need a name first. - But you have one. Not the right kind. The latest dancing sensation in any nightclub has a bigger name that I have. But that's ridiculous. If you were an architect and came to me with your architectural background .. Family, training and experience. Why, I would hire you in a minute. It's logic. But that's not show business. Do you mean to say that you can't get a part? Oh, I can get plenty of parts. On the road. But nothing in New York. And I .. I've got a good play with a good part. But no-one will produce it. May I read it? Why? There isn't an architect living .. Who doesn't think he would make the best set designer in the world. Just a moment I will get it. There you are. - Thank you. You know, my friends sometimes call me eccentric. I am not. But I do play hunches. I'll call you in the morning. Goodnight. Goodnight. Mr Snowden. I want to thank you again for everything. Not a bit. I've had fun. Goodnight. I'll wait to hear from you. - Alright. Hello? No, Mr Snowden is not in. Mr Snowden never gets in until one-thirty. No. Never. Okay, I will tell him you called. Goodbye. Morning. Well .. good morning, Mr Snowden. Maybe he should have ducked. Quite a few messages, Mr Snowden. Mr Porter called .. Get me Miss Fay Carter on the telephone. - Yes, sir. What is her number? Huh? I haven't the vaguest idea. If it isn't in the telephone book call information and if they've not got it .. Call every apartment house on 55th Street between 6th and 7th Avenue. And tell Mr Orr I'd like to see him. Well, Mr Orr hasn't come in yet. Not in yet? That is unusual isn't it? - Yes, it is. He is never later than nine. Well I tell you what, Miss Blackstone. Before you get me that number .. Fetch the Jackson blueprints from Mr Orr's office. Yes. Mr Snowden. Who won? Hmm? Oh. That's the way they are wearing them this year, Miss Blackstone. Did you find the Jackson blueprints? Yes, sir. And I think I found Mr Orr too. Where? Underneath the Jackson blueprints. What? [ Snoring sounds ] I am sorry sir, but you left an 11:30 call. What happened to you? A lady gave it to me. What kind of a lady? I don't know. I only saw her with one eye. How do you like our hotel service? If you don't leave by twelve we charge for another day. How do you like the view? Shut up. I've been working all night. This stuff is ready for the drafting room. Hello? Oh. It's you. Carla Orr. She says she is your wife. Do I tell her you just left for Africa? - Alright. I will speak to her. Not before I get a word in. Hiss. Hello. Yes. That was Peter. Yeah, well. You tell him that just confirms the rumor that that he's a snake. Oh Dick darling. Guess what? The mortgage on the apartment is due. Yes. I am going to be .. I am going to be 'evicted'. Whatever that is. Well darling, I know I got my check yesterday morning but .. If I am going to be evicted .. That means I have to come back and live with you. Can you think if anything more horrible happening to either one of us? Oh, you can? Isn't it marvelous how we see eye-to-eye on everything. Alright then, dear. I'll expect my check tomorrow morning. And .. Tell Peter that the curse of Carla is upon him. Yes. Goodbye, sweet. Goodbye. I know a 2-ton safe that would simply love to fall on Carla. Why don't you let me arrange .. - No. Let's forget about Carla. Sure. Say. Did they teach you scenic designing at Carnegie Tech? Yes. Two years of it. Why? Now what are you up to? I am going to back a play. It's alright to tell me that but don't let any of our clients hear you say it. They won't get an inkling until I make my speech on opening night. For my information, what do you know about the theater? Nothing. But she knows everything. - Who? She was born in a trunk backstage between curtain calls. Now, what else is there to know about the theater? And he said he'd call me this morning. Forget it, darling. You imagined it. You were drunk. [ Telephone ] Hello? Yes. This is Miss Carter. Good morning, Mr Snowden. Good morning, Miss Carter. I have read your play. I don't know what the critics will say about it but I like it. I think it has a chance. You ..? You mean you will produce it? Actually? Oh, but you can't. You don't know anything about show business. No, of course not. But you do. Look, suppose we have lunch together and discuss details? Same place as last night? Okay, I will be right over. Oh yes, and I am bringing a friend along. Don't ask me how, but by the look on your face as you talk to that woman .. I know exactly the sort of woman she is. Really? - Yes. Suppose you come and have lunch and see what you can do with the tea leaves? I'll be back this afternoon, Miss Blackstone. And take tomorrow afternoon off too, little boy. You've had a busy day. She's the sort of woman you'll give a wide berth to. She's the sort of woman you'll not even have lunch with. You are going to stop me? - Yes, Me. Dick Orr. I have ten years on you. And I've got 15 pounds on you. Two falls out of three. Recall what I did to you when you messed up and put a cellar of the 45th floor? But do you remember what I did to you? Yes. Made me junior partner. That was strictly a hunch, Dick. And it's still paying dividends. Now. This play .. - No. You mean this woman. Well, this woman if you like. - Yeah. A double hunch. Well, I don't like it. If only you would use your head you would see it is perfectly obvious. He is just some rich man. Without proper respect for women of the theater. He will probably make some insulting comments. That's what you are here for. - Yes. He won't get far with me around. Now, now. No rough stuff, Marian. There she is. She is beautiful. But then she would be. There he is. He looks to me like a wolf in sheep's clothing. But then he would be, the old .. - Marian. Hello. Miss Plantagenet - Mr Snowden. How do you do. We have met before. I don't remember. Oh? Oh yes, of course. Yes, most unusual. Miss Carter, may I present Dick Orr. Close friend and business associate. How do you do. And Miss .. - Plantagenet. Plantagenet. Charmed. Please sit down. You come over here. - Thank you. Cocktail? Well, I .. No thank you. And you? - Orange juice. He spent the night with a 20-storey building on his chest. I'm having a Martini. Come on. It's your last chance. No. When we get to discussing business one of us should have a clear head. Is Mr Orr coming in to the show with us? No. Because I don't consider a play a good business investment. He calls himself my financial adviser and when I mentioned show business .. He barked. Now. I would like to ask a few questions. Strictly business. About how many lays are produced in a year? Well, if it's a good season roughly about 150. 150. How many of those are hits? A dozen or so. The chances of success are just ten percent. Oh. Is it that high? Say, waiter. Have you got a knife suitable for throwing? Supposing I try to sell you some stock? And I frankly told you the chances of losing your money would be 90 percent. What would you do? I should probably buy it. I haven't changed a bit since 1929. You mean you would throw me out on my ear. Oh. I see your point. In other words, Mr Snowden should throw me out on my ear. Well, you are offering him the same proposition. We don't have to stay and be insulted. As soon as we've had our lunch we are going. Have you finished with that pencil? - Yes. May I borrow it please? Thank you. I want to ask a few questions. Strictly business. What would you consider a safe return on a good sound safe investment? Four percent. - Four percent. Well. A hit like Abie's Irish Rose returns one thousand or two thousand percent. And nobody throws nobody out on nobody's ear. An Abie's Irish Rose comes along once in how many years? Twenty-five. Let's say twenty. Show business needs no sympathy from anyone. Once in twenty-five. Alright. Let's make it twenty-three. Multiply 150 plays .. By 23 years. Divide that by 1,000 percent and you get the true return on your investment. Figures don't lie. No. But the men figuring them can. You have got to consider. Now then. You must remember that .. Well, that .. He is right. Any man who puts money in a show needs a guardian. Thanks, anyway. All my life I have only had one worthy ambition. I want to be a stage-door Johnny. Take that money and put it in government bonds. But it's dull hanging around a treasury waiting for the treasurer to emerge. I'm sorry, Miss Carter. You see, there's nothing personal. I had such wonderful plans. I was going to form a company. Fay Carter Productions Incorporated. Yes. And I was going to buy stock in it. $3,000 worth. Why should we live lives hemmed in by four percent? Because it's the only sane thing. - Up the river with sanity. We'll be the angel. You and I. A wing each. But Mr Orr, your watchdog? Oh, he's got the logic. I've got the hunch. All you have to do is look at the figures. Excuse me please. There you are. No figures. It is a sign from heaven. Waiter. Martinis all round. May I see you for a moment? Well, I am awfully busy. Sort of hanging between the 17th and 18th floors. Well, can you defy the law of gravity just for a second? Hey, don't .. It is about this set. It is an exact replica of the Central Park Observatory. Telescope for telescope. - Yes. It's an astronomer's dream and an actor's nightmare. With all those beautiful gadgets cluttering up the stage .. Who will pay any attention to the actors? I thought you wanted realism? - Actors can't compete with scenery. Especially if it's all shiny and chromium plated. Another thing. - Look. I have a building that has to have an 18th floor by 5 o'clock. You've got thingamabobs coming out the floor. We'll have to circumvent. Well, those machines could slide out of the walls. I am glad you mentioned the walls. Are the doors in the right place? No. I never did want to design that set. It's not my racket. I am an architect. Give me 20 or 30 storeys and I'm alright. I've no time .. - Shush. Don't get excited. See. Now. No echo. Plenty of room for the actors. Entrances and exits in the right place. No collisions in doorways. I am awfully sorry. Are you alright? Fine. How about you? Great. I can't understand it. Going by the sound, one of us should have a headache. Wait until tomorrow. These things take time, you know. Thanks. Say, you really know your job. I should know something about the theater. I played my first part when I was two and I'm still stagestruck. Our case histories are very similar. I made my first dog kennel aged three and I've made nothing to equal it since. A cigarette? - No thanks. When will you start on the park set? Oh no. I have got some real work to do. I can't be bothered with stage sets. But didn't Pete tell you? We're trying to do this show as cheaply as possible. Regular scenic designers cost money. I hate parks. I am an architect. Whenever see open ground without a building on it, it annoys me. Be reasonable. A park isn't difficult. I'll help you. Come on. Please. No. Get a professional to design it. Over there. Use my phone. We can't afford it. Afford? After the money you wasted of Pete's already. What's the difference? Another thousand or so? Waste? What do you mean, 'waste'? Look it up. It means to squander. To wantonly throw away. I tell you, some of the biggest fortunes in history were made in the theater. Yeah? Well, not by architects. Compared to a play, digging for oil in 42nd Street is a sensible investment. You want us to flop, don't you. All I want is a building with 18 storeys by five o'clock. When I told Jimmy the boss had gone into show business he almost died laughing. Know what he said? I can't conceive of anything he might say interesting me. Morning. Oh. Good morning. Mrs Orr is in your office. Good morning. Oh. Here he is now. Hello, Carla. - Hello, dear. What's up? Nothing in particular. Money? - Money? Thanks, no. Well, I am astounded. - I thought you would be. I don't wish to be impolite but I'm so busy and if you don't want something .. What is it? I have heard Peter Snowden is backing a show. Well? - I want a part in it. A part? Forget it. You are not an actress. Well, I suppose the woman that Peter is backing is another doozy? She's the daughter of a great actor. She was raised in the theater. She's acted all her life. She knows .. Why Richard, you seem quite excited about her yourself. Do I? - Yes. Well, it is ridiculous. If you must know. You know not how to speak. Why? Because. Oh, it doesn't matter. Besides, it's none of your affair. A cigarette? You know, you are so adorable when you get petulant. Won't you please give me a divorce? Oh, dear. If I don't love you enough to live with you. I certainly don't dislike you enough to divorce you. Just being separated from you is my happy medium, thank you. Yes. But you can take your choice. Now think of it: Reno, Mexico. All expenses, a staggering settlement. And custody of your mother. For that, I should bounce this off your thick head. Be careful. Be careful of the carpet. Why don't you be reasonable? We tried to make a go of this thing and failed. It was your fault. Alright. Let's say it is my fault. The fact is, it's a fluff. Now you just listen to me, Richard Orr. I am completely bored. I want something to do. I think it will be simply divine to be an actress. And you are going to see to it that I get a part in that play. I said I've nothing to do with that play. I can't get you a part and even if I could I wouldn't. And that's that. Now, will you please let me alone so I can do some work? Alright. But. Don't forget. I'll be around to see how you get on with this new lady of yours. Goodbye. Who is Fay Carter anyway? I believe she's the daughter of an old actor .. Who used to trail around the country putting the ham into Hamlet. Trial by jury, eh? Not jury. Inquisition. Snake. Don't look so surprised. I prevailed on Dick to bring me to your opening just to see your newest protégé. I hear that she is a splendid actress both on the stage and off. Beautiful too. - Yes. We'll see. See you after the show? - I suppose so. What happens after the show? I give a party to celebrate Miss Carter's success. Or console her failure. I'm sure you will forgive me darling if I don't come. You're already forgiven. I'm sure you won't be too disappointed. Come on. Let's get seated. Miss Carter would like to see you, sir. - Oh. Thanks. For your information, we're going to Daisy Lathberry's tonight. For your information we go Peter's. - I am going to Daisy's. If you do, you will go alone. - I'm quite accustomed to that. The way you want it, isn't it? - Why shouldn't I? It's more fun when you're not around. You know, I can't remember a line. I'll ruin the play. I know I will. I've never been so nervous in all my life. Nervous? Nervous? What is there to be nervous about? It's just another show. Just another show. That's all. Only it happens to be in New York instead of Corpus Christi or Fargo. Look at me. I've got the whole play on my shoulders. Am I nervous? Am I nervous? - Of course not, darling. I am so nervous. My knees are shaking so that I can hardly stand up. I wish I were in a nursing home in Timbuktu. But I remember my lines. I don't go around whining. I don't .. Oh dear. Who let you in? - Why, Blanche. Blanche. Don't you ever dare let anyone in without telling me first. But you sent for Mr Snowden, Miss Carter. Oh, Did I? I don't remember. I don't remember. I can't remember. - Oh, forget it. I have. If you can't remember the lines do Juliet's balcony speech. That fits into any play. How do I look? - Divine. Perfect. First act. Places please. I'm coming. Coming. It's come. It is you show, Fay. Your success. And my failure. No. Only successes for you, Fay. And for you, Peter. It's your show and it is in the bag. And now I remember. That's why I sent for you. I wanted to give you something before I went on. Stand still. Come along. The first act curtain is down. They were a bit late ringing up. - See any of the show? Not me. If it's a flop I don't want to. If it's a hit, I'll see it until I'm sick of it. You're telling me. - There she goes. Right. Not a bad first act. My dear lady, the road to theatrical ruin is paved with good first acts. I liked her. Not bad but any actress can get away with one act. She is magnificent. What has she done before? Fay Carter, did you say? - Yes. Lovely, isn't she. Mark my words, they liked it. They didn't exactly stand up and cheer. - My dear, but they listened. And believe me it's a rare occurrence for a first night audience .. To listen to the actors instead of each other. I know. I watched their faces. - Was he there? Who? On stage for second act please, Miss Carter. Coming. Dick Orr. - Oh, him. Oh yes, he was there, smug and glowering in the fourth row. I hate that man. Well, we've got two acts to prove that he was wrong. Now Marian, be a darling and kick me again for good luck. That's the girl. Thank you. Be sure to drop in later. Just a tiny little soiree with 400 of my most intimate friends. Thanks most awfully. Goodnight. Blanche. - Yes, Miss? Guard the door. Say that I'm changing. Yes, Miss. Well, gallant Peter? Well, goldmine? I don't need to tell you how superb I thought you were tonight. Who made it possible? - Oh, I only had the money. And the hunch. - And the confidence. Remember my lecture on training, background? And I remember the luncheon next day. Now Dick meant well. He .. - Let him do his own apologising. You are not going to gloat? The situation will create the mood. Now, if you don't leave me alone I shall not get to your party until after dawn. I'll be waiting impatiently. You were great, Fay. See you later. Make the most of this dance. - Why? Well, it is your last dance as a nonentity. After the morning papers come out .. You'll be able to dance in public only with the aid of four 200-pounders. Who, surrounding you on all sides. Will beat off autograph hunters with lead-lined clubs. I will love it. No dark glasses for me. I want everyone to know who I am. An actress who doesn't should never be allowed inside of a theater. Did Dick show up? - No sign of him yet. Where's Marian? She left the bar ten minutes ago with a bottle under each arm. She said not to worry. That she would write. If you ever want to break a lease, keep Marian in mind. Dick will be along any minute now. I thought Mr Orr complements his nights as well as his days with hard work. Oh no. You are wrong there. Dick works like the devil but he plays like the devil too. Say, I wish you two would get along better. He's a grand fellow when you get to know him. Why should I get to know him? Well, because .. - There. You see. You can't answer. Peter dear, don't go round the world .. Trying to make your friends become friends with each other. It is fatal. - In what way? Either you fail. And that means a lot of hard work for nothing. Or if you succeed, then you are left out in the cold. Hey, where did you learn all this worldly wisdom? I don't know. Maybe from some of the parts I've played. We've found Marian. Where? I'll have an awful time getting her out of there. Why should you want to? The music sounds better than it did before. I'll ask her to show me her union card. That will do it. See you in the bar later, Peter. Hello, Dick. - Peter. Your hunch was a good one. - You liked it? You'll get a lot of money back on your investment. She knows her stuff, doesn't she. - Yes. She is brilliant. You want me to tell her she said that? - No. Why do you suppose I came here? Now how do you feel? Good enough to get back and make those old drums talk. You are coming along with me. I know this man. I know him, I know him. I can't remember his name but it will come to me in a minute. If this eye were black you'd know me instantly. Once around the room and you will be revealed to me. Good luck, Peter. Shall we dance? Yes. Hello. Hello. I suppose you thought I wasn't coming. I wondered. Did you really? Yes. Then you were actually thinking about me? In a way. I suppose you were thinking I didn't have the nerve to face you. Was I? If nothing else you've proved that I was absolutely right. When I told you I didn't know anything about show business. You're evading the issue. Very clumsily I am afraid. Yes. Anyway, you were superb. If I were a critic I would say .. The inspired performance of Fay Carter left nothing to be asked for .. Except her telephone number. The acting was on a par with the play. And the play should have a nice long run. And anyone who doesn't think so. Should have their head bounced for echoes. And that, if you still think I am evading the issue .. Is an apology. Not bad. A successful one too. I see. Why did we come out here? I wanted to show you your city. Mine? Yes. You took possession of it tonight as the curtain ran down on the last act. Look at it. How does it feel to have that at your feet and know that the city is yours? I can't say. It never occurred to me like that. Had it ever occurred to you that you and I might be sitting here alone .. And actually, may I say, peaceful? I had thought of it. - Great. I wasn't quite sure it was possible. It should have been. I did your sets the way you wanted them done, didn't I? That was the day I started thinking. I couldn't think of anything but you for days after that. When did you get time to do the sets? They were part of you. Every line I drew had something to do with you. And if they were beautiful it was because they had to be. To compliment you. I don't believe it. It's true. It's an exciting view, isn't it. Fay. It was more than a show. It was a revelation. And I thought I needed you. But you don't? Of course I don't. Of course. It's utterly ridiculous, but .. I can't think of anything to say except .. It's so sudden, Dick. Lightning never struck faster. Or with more force. I just must be tired. I don't seem to be able to think clearly right now. I .. Here, I have achieved a lifelong ambition tonight. It seems so terribly unimportant compared to this. And involved. Fay. - Dick. Let's not talk now. I want to think about what's happened to us. Things like this don't usually happen to grown-ups, do they? They do. I'll take a note on it. What are you looking at? New York. It has finally decided to be completely kind to me. 'Say it with flowers'. Is Mr Orr in yet? - He is not. 'Say it with flowers'. If you must sing that song will you please keep in tune. Dear me, we did get out of bed the wrong side this morning. Morning, Miss Blackstone. - Good morning. Come in please. Hello? Vogue flower shop? Yes. Well, we want two dozen chrysanthemums. The big giant yellow ones. And one dozen tiger-lilies. Yes. On Mr Snowden's account and the same address. Yes. Thank you. Mr Snowden wanted to be informed when you came in. It's extremely good for Mr Snowden to wait for me just once. Now these papers .. - These papers can wait. Miss Reid, tell me. When you went to school did you ever play hooky? I did not. - That's a pity. One of the joys of life. Knowing you should be away working and you're not. And for no reason at all. Yeah. Well, try it someday. Here. Take a letter to Chalmers and Hastings. Dear sir. Who is the best florist in New York? You want that written? - No. I am asking you. Who is? Oh, I believe the Vogue Flower Shop on Madison is the most expensive. That's good. Order a dozen chrysanthemums. Red ones. And send them to Miss Fay Carter. You know the address. Yes, Mr Orr. Morning, Dick. - Morning. Got a few minutes? - Sure. Come in. Do that little job and I'll ring for you if I need you. Yes, Mr Orr. Two dozen chrysanthemums? And where are they to go? But Mr Snowden's daily order has already gone to Miss Carter. Oh. 'Say it with flowers'. 'Beautiful flowers'. So. In view of the facts, we've decided Fay Carter Productions .. Shall become a permanent thing. Now look. I'm me. I have little money. Don't want dividends. The perfect stockholder. Can't I get in on this somehow? It's an old theatrical tradition. To ensure success the business end of a theater .. Shall be inefficient, inexpert and muddle-headed. Well, that is me. So, in future I'm devoting all my time to Fay Carter Productions Incorporated. Completely? - I've drawn my last plan. The Jackson Building is my last gift to the Manhattan skyline. Pete, have sense. You can't quit. In the end it will all be for the best. Skyscrapers will be straighter. Foundations will be firmer. And what about Snowden and Co.? - That becomes your baby. I offer you a full-fledged partnership. - What? 'Snowden and Orr'. My name still comes first because, well I am handsomer. Do you accept? - Do I accept? Pete, I don't know how to thank you. - We'll call a lawyer and make it legal. Not necessary. I take your word for it. - Come on. Tonight you go home and take a shower. The cold water will clear your head. You'll realize you're doing all the work for only half the money. That is the moment that I want your name on an ironbound contract. Now listen to this. Superlatives. All superlatives. 'Ecstasy'. 'Exquisite'. 'Divine'. I have never read such notices in all my life. Now listen. 'It's a long time since Broadway has had the opportunity to discover an actress'. 'Who actually knows how to act'. 'Fay Carter is unique'. Oh, Fay. You are not even listening. Poor darling. You are worn out, aren't you. Too tired even to care about your notices. But you know .. If you didn't look so healthy .. I would ask you if you weren't well. And I'd say I've never felt better in my life. You have every right to be deliriously happy this morning. Well, I am too. Far too happy for an actress who hasn't even read her press notices. Impossible. [ Telephone ] Hello? Hello dear. It is a beautiful day and not a cloud in the sky. But there will be stormy weather if I don't see you today. You will? This afternoon. Yes. I have got something terribly important to do this morning. I will see you about four. I will expect you. Don't you dare be a minute late. Goodbye, darling. Of course. I suppose one might say it was none of my business. But were you by any chance talking to the weatherman? No, darling. Just Dick. Dick who? Dick Orr. No the Dick Orr? The same. - But when did it happen? The last thing I knew, you two were .. - On our way to the terrace. Now that proves what sort of a man he is. The moment my back is turned .. - It wasn't exactly your back, dear. Well. Anyhow. You are making a big mistake. Now listen to me. And I am not going to be silly. If you are in love, you are in love. And you're not the first woman who has acted like an idiot. But you are no ordinary woman. You are a star. And don't forget that while one hit can make a star .. It can't keep her shining forever. You've got to start thinking about your next play. You can't afford to become involved with anything else. [ Telephone ] Yes. Speaking. I'll call her. Are you going to tell him? You might as well. You've got to tell him sooner or later. Hello Peter. Yes. Yes. I would love to have luncheon with you. Will you call for me here at half past one? Is Mrs Orr in? - Yes, Mr Orr. Hello Carla. Do you know, something about your face reminds me of a man I once married. Has the building burned down or has a certain architect been fired? I'm glad you remember me because I brought our marriage licence along .. To identify myself, but now it won't be necessary, will it. No. Because I have a good memory for faces. How would you like to completely obliterate mine from your life? No. It isn't that distasteful to me, dear. Besides, I couldn't help remembering on the first of every month. Listen, Carla. We've been married for five years. The last two just didn't work. Isn't that so? But whose fault was that? Mine, if you like. It doesn't matter. The point is it hasn't worked. We've just drifted along instead of making the clean break we should have .. When we first split up. I know, darling, but .. I simply can't bring myself to buying the right sort of clothes for Reno. Well, how would you like to start shopping today .. And send the bills to me? Why the sudden generosity, darling? Well, don't you think as long as we are no longer man and wife that .. We should make it official? Why today? Because at last I'm in a position to do the thing properly by you financially. Peter made me a partner today. Yes. So, if you'll go I'll have an attorney draw up an agreement. You can have any settlement you like. But within reason. And then we can break off without any bitterness or without any regrets. You know, Dick. I have been thinking. I rather like the idea of being a wife of a partner in a firm of architects. It is rather a cosy idea. But, Carla. We can have more money. We can .. Entertain a little. We can lead our own lives. Only under happier, more prosperous circumstances. But it's always been understood .. That if one of us wanted a divorce the other wouldn't stand in the way. But now, Dick. Let's be reasonable. I have waited so long and so patiently. You can't expect me to suffer the lean years .. And then remove myself conveniently when the fat ones come along, can you? Let's give it a trial anyway. I can't. - Why not? Oh. Who is she? - You wouldn't know. I wonder. It couldn't possibly be Peter Snowden's protégé, could it? Oh my. You have become his partner, haven't you. That is pretty rotten, Carla. That's to be expected and we will not quarrel about it. The question is, will you or will you not divorce me? Well darling, we won't quarrel about that either. No. The theater phoned me this morning. They have taken a 20-week buy on Springboard. You know what that means? - Sure. It means I'm a wily old fox who's backed a winner. I knew that the first day I saw you. - No. It means that very soon now I'll be able to buy you out of Carter Productions. Buy me out? - Now don't get excited. There isn't enough money in the world to pay you back for what you did for me. But I will feel a lot happier when I am completely independent. I won't sell. I want to feel that I have a share in you. Always. But you will have. I will be an old woman with a long grey beard before I can pay you all back. You understand? No. I'm very dense this morning. I don't understand anything. And what's more, I am not going to try. You don't want to stay in show business? But I do. I love it. In fact, I was thinking of building a theater for you. No, Peter. We were lucky this time. The next play might be a flop. Well, what if it is? We'll try again. What about your business? Ah, that's been taken care of. I have made Dick a full partner. Really? - Uhuh. He'll run the business while I play at being a producer. He tried to buy in on Carter Productions. So I gave him the Snowden Company. He'll make more money but I will have much more fun. I don't think Dick really cares much about money. Do you? No. Not for himself. It takes a lot to keep that wife of his going. Wife? - Hmm. Carla. Oh. Didn't you know? No. No. I guess he forgot to tell me. Because he tries to forget it himself as often as he can. Fay. Remember that day, right here when we discussed your contract? Yes. You remember the terms of the agreement? Not the financial ones. The others. About falling in love and .. all that. Yes. Well? I love you, Peter. But I am not in love with you. I kind of expected you to say that. Besides. I wouldn't give up my work for married life. The theater and my job would always have to come first. That is alright with me. It wouldn't be a fair bargain to you, Peter. And anyway. I don't think I will ever love anyone again. Even an angel like you. Suppose I'm willing to take the risk? Would it make you very happy to marry me? Yes. Very. Okay, boss. Your hunches have been lucky so far. Maybe the luck will continue. To the luckiest girl in the world. And it is signed 'Peter'. Will you stop looking like the first day of winter. You're getting a darned good man in Peter. If you don't want him pass him on to me. Marian, please. Now, will you stop thinking about that Orr person. Any man who makes a state secret out of being married .. [ Buzzer ] For Miss Carter. - Thank you. These will have to go in the Frigidaire. We haven't got any more vases. Peter is overdoing things. But these aren't from Peter. They are from a man with a state secret. Oh. And all he has written is his name. Not another word. He probably couldn't think of anything to say. Well, throw them away. No. I have got a worse fate than that planned for them. Back to Mr Orr they go. But I won't be at a loss for words to put on the card either. [ Telephone ] Hello. Talk of the devil. Ask him to come up. He's on his way up. I don't see how you could ever see him again. I don't see how you can stand to have him in the same room with you. I want to see him, Marian. I want to tell him what I think of him. - Ah. Then you have my blessing. I will go. Hello Marian. - Hmm. Hello Fay. Marian, Dick and I prefer to be alone. - Yes, but I don't think that he .. Alright. But if you want any help .. I am in the next room. What is the matter? Why didn't you tell me you were married? Oh. I see. Peter told me. I tried to tell you but you wouldn't listen. You could have told me when you telephoned this morning. I was on my way to ask Carla for a divorce when I talked to you. You see, we haven't lived together for a long time. Asking her for a divorce was something I wanted to do months ago. And when you finally did ask her? She refused. So you only added another mistake to the first one. We'll work it out some way. After all, two people can't each other as much as we .. It's over, Dick. Done for. But I love you. And I am going to marry you. It is too late, Dick. I promised Peter I would marry him. But you don't love him. Oh yes I do .. in a way. And I won't let him down now. I couldn't hurt him like that. No. Will you please go, Dick. I am going to cry and .. I don't like people watching me except across the footlights. Please Dick. You know, I still can't believe it is true. Is it? Uhuh. Stand back while I turn another handspring. Who is the woman with Dick? Uhoh. It's an ill wind that blows in the uninvited. Who is she? - Carla Orr. Dick's wife. I thought they weren't living together. - They aren't. Then? I suppose she came in alone and then attached herself to Dick. She has a way of attaching herself. Mark my words. She'll be up to some mischief before the night is out. But she can't spoil our party. Let's not worry about her. Smile, darling. You can't win all the time. Don't they look divinely happy. Don't get up. I am just here on parole between dances. Why is it that only men over 225 pounds want to dance with me? And that is not the worst of it. They like to dance with me. One heavyweight tells another. I know how you feel. And being lucky at cards is being no consolation. Marian. This is my wife, Carla. Carla, this is Marian Plantagenet. Oh yes, yes. Of course. Yes. How do you do. Oh, Fay. What is it, Marian? - This is Dick's wife. Fay. This is my wife, Carla. Carla, this is Miss Fay Carter. How do you do. I am so glad to meet you, Miss Cater. I want to congratulate you on Springboard and on Peter too. Two hits out of two. - Thank you. I've never seen you looking so smug, Peter. I feel smug but so would any man under the circumstances. Won't you sit down, Miss Carter? I want you to tell me how you managed to make Peter look so happy. You know, I would dearly love to get the same expression on Dick's face but .. I just don't seem able to do it. One doesn't do it, Mrs Orr. It just happens if the circumstances are right. Oh, I see. And if the circumstances are wrong? Shall we dance, Peter? That is yours, Dick. Fay says she hasn't danced with you all evening. Well, I suppose .. - Go. You have my permission. Thank you, Mrs Orr. Yes. I will dance with you. Oh. I didn't get your invitation, Peter. Of course I was sure you would send me one but it had gotten lost in the mail. How are you, Carla? - Very happy, thank you. It looks like tonight is a great night for us, doesn't it. Us? Yes. You get your girl and I get back my man. Oh, you've patched things up with Dick? - Well no, not exactly. But we will. He'll get over her in no time. Who? Say, what are you talking about? Why Fay, of course. He is madly in love with her. But he will get over that. Now look here, Carla. Don't be angry with me, Peter. I am just an innocent bystander. All I know is that Dick came to me and asked for a divorce. He said he was mad about Fay. He even tried to make me believe that Fay as mad about him. But I didn't go for that. Thanks for the eye-opener, Peter. I don't know what you are trying to stir up but I do know you're lying. In the Middle Ages they would have burnt you at the stake for a witch. I am going to ask for a year's leave of absence. Oh, Dick. I just want to see what's left of the rest of the world. I don't suppose I will see you again for a long time. You don't still think I .. - No, Dick. Then it is too late, isn't it? Yes, darling. Fay. I will always love you. Let's go home the long way. Twice round the park? What do you say? Harry .. - Darling. Would you mind taking me home right away? I am awfully tired. - My sweet, I am so sorry. Never mind, Harry. We'll take this car right home. Fay. I haven't kissed you since 8 o'clock. [ Door knocks ] Come in. Morning, Dick. A nice time last night? About as good as can be expected. You didn't finish the night sleeping under the blueprints again, did you? I didn't sleep. Something wrong? Everything and nothing. You wouldn't care to give me a few of the highlights would you? Oh. Just Carla. All I need at the moment is a nice long vacation. But Dick. I want you for the wedding. You're going to be my best man. Oh no. Not I. Why not? Because I have an urge to see a glacier somewhere in Norway. It sounds far away .. and cold. When did you get an urge to see a glacier in Norway? I have always wanted to sit on one and watch the avalanches roll by. Have you told Fay? No. No reason why I should. Well, she will miss you. No she won't. I'm not so sure. Anyway, I don't want to talk about it. There's a boat sailing a midnight. I've booked passage on it. - Midnight? Isn't a partner entitled to two weeks' notice? Sorry, Peter. I can't wait. You kinda caught me off guard, Dick. - Oh, no. In a few weeks the office will run along as smoothly as if I'd never been here. I wasn't thinking of the office. I was thinking of Fay and you. She warned me, you know. She said people who try to bring others together might get left out in the cold. And not in Norway either. You are going to marry her. She doesn't love me. She told me so. I am sorry, Peter. If there was a way, I'd make her love you. I know you would. But that's not the way it works. People can't be made to fall in love. Come and have supper with me, Dick. We'll have a quiet evening together. Then I'll take you down to the pier and wave you off to Norway and the glaciers. And the avalanches. You don't have to go all the way to Norway for avalanches. Good evening, Reynolds. - Good evening, Miss. Mr Snowden phoned. He will be a little late, Miss Carter. Thank you. Hello Dick. Hello Fay. Reynolds said that Peter might be late. Wasn't he at the theater tonight? No. The first performance he has missed. It showed too. There wasn't half the usual applause. How is Marian? Oh she is well. Marian is always well. Thanks, Reynolds. Never had a sick day in her life. The doctor is going to do something about it. I hope Peter gets here pretty soon. I've got to catch a boat in 45 minutes. A boat? What kind of a boat? Oh, a regular oceangoing liner. Going to Norway. Oh. Why Norway? I just stuck a pin in the map and .. Up came Norway. Where is it exactly? I never have been sure. It's up north somewhere. You know. With Finland and Sweden. In that neighborhood. Will you be gone long? I don't know. Until I get homesick. How long will that be? I'm homesick right now. But I will make a tour of it. I remember now. Norway is some part of a peninsula. Pretty soon I'll remember what a peninsula is. Fay. You're looking badly. You are miserable. And so am I. Here is to health. Skol. I can't imagine why you invited me here. Even less why I came. I want to apologise, Carla. You were right. I'm sorry. - What are you going to do about it? The first thing I'm going to do is to kick Dick out neck and crop. Peter, you can't do that. That ungrateful man will find it hard to earn a living in New York .. By the time I'm done with him. He may be able to start somewhere else. Middle-west perhaps. But that is his own affair. What about this Carter creature? Fay? It's easier to forgive a woman, don't you think? What about me? Am I supposed to stay and share poverty with a man who deserted and shunned me? What else is there to do, my dear? Well, I could sue him for divorce and her too. No, hardly for divorce. - Alienation of affections. Why, I would ruin her name so quick. If you do that you ruin your own chance of getting anything out of her. She's only been in the big money a few weeks. You would get nothing and just make a fool of yourself. Now, I've got a solution. You can't possibly go on with Dick. You had better divorce him. Yes? And live on what? Not so fast, Carla. You may not know that I've turned Fay into a company .. In which I hold the bulk of the shares. It's obliviously not in the company's interest that Fay Carter's name .. Is dragged through the mud. As president, I might be able to do a deal with him. What's your game, Peter? You want to talk business? I am very fond of Dick. Waiter. Two more Highballs. Alright. I will talk business with you. - Good. A cigarette? I can't imagine what can be keeping Peter. Does Peter know that you are leaving for Norway? Yes. I told him this morning. That's when he asked me to come this evening for a last-minute bull session. Don't you see? He has left us here alone here on purpose. That is his way of stepping out. But we mustn't let him, Dick. It isn't fair, is it? No. It's not fair. Goodbye, Fay. Make him very happy. He deserves it. I'll send you an icicle from Norway. Hello, Fay. - Hello, Peter. Where is Dick? - He has gone to the boat. What? But he can't leave now. I've just come from Carla. She has agreed to go to Reno. We must get to the pier before the boat sails. You can't do this. I won't let you. I'm not sacrificing myself. I'm using plain common-sense. Well, I want to marry you. - No, you don't. You want to be decent and show your gratitude without hurting me. That's no good for marriages. They get on each other's nerves. I'd be jealous and you'd be resentful. And all for the sake of a quixotic gesture. We must live our lives, my dear. Not pretend them. You know I am right Fay, don't you? Yes. Now, we just have time to make that boat. I'm not sailing. There's someone aboard l must see. You missed it. We sail at any moment. I've simply got to. - Sorry. But it's a question of life and death. Dick! Dick! Carla is going to get a divorce! [ Ship's horn. Loud ] Carla! Divorce! Carla. What about Carla? Dick! (.r0s.)
