Okay, alright everybody we're ready Here you go, Finn I know. Okay Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday dear, Finn Happy Birthday to you Make a wish for anything you want in the world Come on! What do you mean? Right now? One full day This is one full day! Twenty four hours! Trust me, it had nothing to do with you Please, say "hi" to Jimmy for me You make everything so difficult Fuck you! Finn, no! Come back! Dad! Dad, no! Dad, wait! Wait! Hey Finnegan Um, that's - that's not my name I know I just think it's a cute nickname. What's the trouble with that? Hey, can I see a question? I think you already did. Why do you look into this house so much. I see you do it every time you drop off my newspaper. I just know someone who lives there. That's all. Do you ever visit them? Nope mmm, and they don't visit me Do you wanna come inside for some coffee. I just made a pot I don't really drink coffee I have tea I kinda gotta get back to my route. Right. Hey, um, there's a party going on tonight, you should come. I would love to see you there Is it a college party? Yeah, it's friends from school I don't... I don't really go to school That's okay. You can bring a friend if you'd like. Will you at least think about it? I'll think about it Okay. Well, I'll send you the address just in case OK OK Bye? One or two? One two You know one of these days I would love to hear that beautiful voice of yours You better take notes off I am What are you doing today? Going to the rink No, you're not you're watching your sister I have to work Okay If you're forcing me to watch Kate, why did you ask what I was doing today for maladies mom? Formalities Mom, I have to go train Okay, if it's that important to you, you can take her with That's... that's embarrassing. What if people see? Nobody goes to the rink. I think you'll be fine Okay, isn't Kate old enough to do her own hair? Once the mitts come off and she learns to stop scratching Okay, isn't she a little too old for pigtails Maybe, but it keeps the boys away so it's fine by me Will you two survive? Yes Hey, what's up, Mr. Hollenbeck? Good morning, Finn, Kate Mind if we, uh, go in? Yeah go on in, I'll be in in a sec Ok Okay, Kate I asked Cosmo to meet me here this morning, so try and act cool, alright? Can you time me? Great Three two one go Time! Oh, 35:04 not bad for a warmup You know if keep self congratulating yourself you'll never beat your old records, my friend Cosmo! Finn Kind of hard to do in skates well You better get back to work Okay, I only came here for emotional and only absolutely necessary physical support Get back out there. Got it You know I ran the numbers last night It's not looking too good You know in order to achieve perfection at something it's true one needs practice But I needed to ask myself the question how much practice does it take to make perfect We all know the phrase, but I've found that in my studies. It takes approximately 10,000 hours of practicing something before achieving perfection at it For Finn this means practicing at least four hours a day six days a week. Take off one day for the Sabbath god rest Ye merry gentlemen. We're looking at around one thousand two hundred and forty eight hours a year, so it will take roughly Point zero one two years for Finn to achieve perfection at skating by then He'll be much closer to thirty far less flexible His muscle mass will be on the downhill and don't even get me started on his bone dexterity. Oh, and the competitions in four weeks, so But I'm trying to remain positive, you know focus on the good Like maybe no one will show up Or maybe no one else in the competition will be as dedicated and skilled One can hope He's really going all-out for this, huh? Yep Ever since you posted that flyer in the window last spring it's been all he can talk about "Cosmo, I'm gonna be the best roller skater in the Midwest. I guarantee it" Well, the kid doesn't need a competition to prove he's great Hey Watch your posture Come in You still need those files right? Bring 'em on in OK Uhhh You white people are so boring Alright, fine I joined one of those dating sites. There. Isn't that exciting. Which one? Christian Mingle? Black People Meet? No, no Um, it's one of the ones on my phone Tinder! That's the one So you been swipin' this weekend Apparently too much so You got a match And we may or may not be meeting tonight. What girl you just built all the tea? Who was this guy? He's just someone from around town seemed nice. Well, look at Barb's gonna get herself a man That is not what this is. It's just... I was just curious Then that's fine. Just do your thing. You don't think it's Weird or anything do you? Why would it be weird? With the kids and everything They're old enough But I'm not My identity has been wrapped up in being mom for so long I thought it was time I started exploring new things Such as What it's like to be me All right, what'll that be today Uh, what was that an hour and a half? $7.50 Keep the change Thanks, I need it Tell you boys I've been running the numbers lately and things don't look very good around here. What? I hate to say it Okay, ah But I have to train for the competition I'll be back here every day up until then that has to give you some good business, right? every little bit helps if only Cosmo had a way of inventing a money machine I tried that once, almost got arrested so I'll be back tomorrow. All right guys. Have a good day Hey, wait a minute before you go, uh There's something I would want to run past you What's that? I have a date tonight, and I'm kind of nervous about it Oh Is that why you were brushing your teeth in the parking lot? No So you guys are young Sure, you have no problem with the ladies. You got any tips for an old fellow like me That is not my department It's okay, buddy. I got you You know in my experience, I've found that ladies love being romanced by words You know be a poet say something like you're fresher than tomorrow's milk, baby chicks dig that Also, um ladies love pheromones, you know biologically speaking. So just try to smell like yourself Unless, uh She doesn't like you and then Try to smell like somebody else duly noted All right, well, uh, see you tomorrow I'm worried about what Mr. Hollenbeck said Don't be I mean that place has been open since before we were born Ain't gonna close anytime soon. Yeah, but, the economy I've wanted this as far back as I can remember Relax, everything will work itself out Yeah, but what about Murphy's Law you talk about that a lot. If something can go wrong it will Look science is right about basically everything it's factual, but This is different It's fate Your fate is to win this competition. I sure, hope so Hey, I, uh, got invited to a party today What? Yeah by uh by that girl from high school, Lily Um, she said I could bring friends. Did you tell her you only have one No!

You are going to regret staying at home while knowing that there's people out there experiencing things. Living! Are you looking for someone? Uh, yeah. Lily, do you know where she is? Maybe I've never seen you around here before What I've never seen you around here before Oh, uh, you have no reason to How about this we play a little game If you win I'll tell you where Lily is If you lose I guess you're on your own.

I just wanted to make sure you got home okay I hope everything's all right with your son. I want to let you know I had a great time tonight I'm sorry, we couldn't finish out the evening, but I know that things happen Anyway, you were great If you want to go out again Call me What do you want? Okay, I came here to apologize For what? For making you go to that party I should have never made you do that if it made you uncomfortable Okay Just okay Yeah I apologized actions speak louder than words Cosmo I'll believe it when I see it How am I supposed to do that? Invent time travel and go back and change everything? Well, you are an inventor that's a start Okay, you know I can't do that. I would if I could but So I'll just prove to you that from here on out I'll be a good friend How about I help you win that competition? That would be great. If only I could train but since I'm grounded I can't so it's not a lot of catching up to do So when you're ungrounded we'll start up again Everything will be okay Cosmo you don't understand. The only thing I want in this world is to win that competition and you put that in jeopardy Fine maybe I did Listen don't be mad at Lily. She couldn't help what her boyfriend did Just be mad at me instead. I deserve it. She doesn't All right Work on time travel machine Work on making Finn less stubborn machine What's going on Mr. H? Oh Finn hi, I don't know exactly how to say this. I had to close a rink. I just came by for some paperwork. What? This can't be happening Look, I'm sorry that I haven't been here this week. I was grounded I could have if I would have I just I'll be here every day up into the competition and after I'm sorry kid the rent increased. I just can't afford it The rink is closed until further notice What about the competition? I'm sorry about the competition. If it makes you feel any better. I heard there's another competition in Iowa It doesn't. I don't want to win in Iowa. I wanna win here. This is where I've been training. This is where the competition should be I wish I could help kid Maybe it's time for the both of us to do something different with our lives. I don't want to I want to do this This is my dream too Maybe the universe has other plans. Okay, Mr. H. is there any way we can keep the rink open? If you can come up with $4,500 by the end of the week to pay for this month's and next month's rent Yeah, I guess then the competition would still be on I'll get you that money Mr. H I promise I hope so kid for your sake and for mine Finn, what are you doing here this is my place of work you can't go barging in like this- It's your fault Barbara What? What's my fault? the rink closed down Okay, I'm sorry to hear that Finn If you were really sorry you woulda let me train now because of you I lost the two most important things I care about in this world skating and the competition Stop being overdramatic You did not lose skating. You're right. I just lost my favorite place in the world to do it at Finn you're being dramatic. You can skate wherever you want. It doesn't have to be at some crappy little ring And where do you suppose I do that at huh? outside Outside What am I a street hooligan? Finn, you skate outside all the time for economical and efficient purposes Not for leisure, don't be facetious Everyone knows if you want a street skate you need in lines. Look, I don't know what to tell you, kid All I know it's just because you didn't skate for a week doesn't mean the rink closed down because of you Now you're just being patronizing. I'm just giving you the facts Whatever Watch that tone, you wanna get grounded for another week? It's not like it's gonna keep me from doing anything I care about I just I don't even know what I'm supposed to do Okay, Finn when I made you the promise that I would do anything I could to help you win this competition, um I wasn't lying Well, I don't think your plan included the roller rink shutting down Have I ever stroke you as a simple man? Excuse me? Have I ever stroke you as a simple man? I don't know what you mean. I've never been stroked by a man before I think you mean striked? No stroke. Strike ain't a word Well, neither is ain't Anyway when I made you that promise I weighed all possible outcomes Calculated every possible way this could have turned out. Even for the worst possible outcome And I think you've arrived at it Actually, uh, this wasn't the worst possible outcome What could have possibly been worse than this? You could have died unexpectedly. I would have been forced to Have you ever seen Weekend at Bernie's? Okay, what's your plan Cosmo? Okay If the rink is closing down because of financial related issues then we get the money we need, right? Genius Why didn't I think of that? Oh, wait, I did. Okay, and did you come up with a solution? Well other than selling non-essential organs not exactly Well good thing I'm way ahead of you Friday night Friday night The church bake sale Go on Well pastor Flynn had that great idea to have these monthly bake sale or good selling equivalent right to raise money for small businesses, and I think this qualifies Okay I think you're onto something but we have 4,500 dollars to raise in four weeks That means that We'll have to raise four thousand five hundred dollars worth of baked sale or good selling equivalent in one night Precisely that's... it's... im... Plausible What sort of goods would we sell? Remember Bobby Dula? He was a freshman when we were seniors. What about him? Well when the chess team was trying to raise money for those matching team shirts his mom made all those brownies for the school remember? Everybody loved them. Those were pretty good brownies So What if we make some sort of deal with her where if she bakes us brownies for the bake sale Then we give her a certain percentage of the profits? I like where this is going Do you think he's home? So You want my mom to make you guys brownies? for a bake sale Okay, it's more of a business deal, actually. Your mom makes us brownies and we turn it into profit It's for a good cause Like to benefit kids with cancer or something? Sort of, um You know the old roller rink in town? I think Well we all know how fun it is to skate there, right? I think the last time I was there I was five This is why it closed down Okay, um, so some people still hold it very near and dear to their hearts, eh Close enough to where they should probably seek professional help but um, it closed down and it needs money to re-open Why don't you guys do a GoFundMe or Kickstarter or something? Look Bobby Dula, we're the ones with the ideas here, okay? We're gonna have a bake sale and it's gonna open the rink back up Well, I guess I can ask my mom if you want. See what she thinks Hey mom some boys from the neighborhood want to talk to you You rang, Bobert? Bobert? That's my full name Isn't Bobby normally short for Robert? It was the 70's. Times were different then, what do you expect? So, what can I help you boys with? You still know how to make your world famous brownies? Of course every Tuesday for yoga night. Finn and Cosmo are trying to save the roller rink in town They're starting a bake sale and they remember your brownies being a huge hit from Chess Club Oh, the old roller rink? Ah, gee, I love that place You were conceived there, you know What can I do for you Um basically just make a crap-ton of brownies for this Friday night. Um, We'll give you 15% of whatever we make. It's for a good cause Oh like haircuts for the homeless? Something like that Make it nine Okay My lucky number And look, it seems like you guys need all the help you can get. I'd love to tag along with you guys to the bake sale Be an actual salesperson. I... thank you to the both of you so much. You have no clue how this is helping me So Glad to help Now Let's get baked Already? Well, of course those brownies aren't just gonna bake themselves. Are they? Listen, I've got a troop meeting I have to get to but I will help as soon as I get back. That's fine I'll just put these boys to work I have to use the bathroom, I'll be right back. I promise to wash my hands Oh, don't I like them better dirty anyway Now, Ms. Dula think of how unsanitary that is and all the diseases you can catch Hand mouth foot disease Pink eye Hepatitis A. Oh well, um I like the one with the D better Now I'm no physician but I don't think you can catch hepatitis D that way Who said I was talking about the disease? Huh, I just wish someone would lick my batter To see if it's any good I could lick your batter How's that Is it good? Very You're sure it doesn't need a little more Sugar? Mmm, oh no, it's um sweet enough Good Cuz you know what they say. If you can't stand the heat Kiss the cook I've uh... never heard that one before Honey be a moose and go get me some milk I... I think you're out Keep looking This will make it much better Well, I guess we can't compete with tote bags Don't lose hope yet I don't get it people always love my mom's goodies Maybe we should give some out first, you know, let him try it and get hooked and then come back for more Not a bad idea. That's always how my mom snagged a man Excuse me woman. Yes? We're selling brownies for the old roller rink in town to stay open The roller rink? That brings back memories That's where I first came to know Jesus My husband but then when the cheating backstabber found a job in Tennessee named Karen I found my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ Right, um Well, the first one is free. So would you like one? Why not? Don't worry she'll be back I sure hope so. We have 4,500 dollars worth to sell We can do it Finn, you know for someone who's wanted this their entire life sure thing could be a little more gung-ho about it Okay, you're right sorry I can do this Excuse me sir. Yes? Would you like a free brownie? Are they gluten-free gluten-free? Gluten-free? What are you from the West Coast? No, I have celiac disease. It's very serious Are these gluten-free? Yes, they're gluten-free But Doc Brown just said no. Well, I'm sorry, you must've misheard So they're gluten-free? Sure. Sure? Sure Whatever All right, that'll be $2.50 Didn't you just say that they're free? The offer expired Mm-hmm. Yes? My change? Change? What do I look like a plastic surgeon? Wasn't that guy the pastor? Made a sale didn't it? First one of the night Cosmo's right We should be handing out free brownie so that way people come back paying for more That's literally what I just I know but you also said if this is something I care about which it is I should try harder. So... I... here I am I'm going to be active. So let's get handing Excuse me, uh, we're handing out free brownie samples. Would you like one? Yeah, thanks Got free brownies Yep, take one Brownies! Yeah, sure They're free because you don't have to pay for them Here you are, okay We have to of handed out over 100 brownies We made one sale Is this even gonna work? It's been two hours the bake sale's technically over What? I can't believe it And we've only made one sale my chances are ruined Jesus H. Christ I need another one of those brownies I need another one of these brownies Uh, ma'am, the bake sale is technically over. I don't care. I'll pay top dollar Name your price. Uh, okay, um Name your price Five Five hundred dollars 500? Dollars? I'm sorry, ma'am, but we can't take personal checks Shhh! Can I take one now? Uh, yeah Mmm! Anyone who says Jesus Christ is the only way has never tried one of these So Jesus? They should start replacing the communion crackers with these brownies I'm glad you call me back. I'm glad you called I can be a little abrasive. I forget not everyone finds that charming. I think I'm not everyone How did a guy like you not - never find someone? Marriage wasn't for me And some things I wanted to do Did you do them? Some of them, and then I realized Those things on my bucket list would be a fun if I had someone to do them with You know, they have a Craigslist ad for that kind of thing. I'll keep that in mind when I bomb the third date You didn't miss out on anything though On what? Being married Is that true? Well At least I didn't have such great look at it I'm sure you've been hurt by people you cared about I think it's really brave of you to put yourself out there again That's one way of putting it Obviously you didn't need it Look at the life you've created for yourself. You raised two great kids That's a direct product of you Parenting is like any other skill You do it for years trying new things failing hoping to get better at it and Years later that day eventually arrives where you're Acceptable at it And you just hope that now is good enough where everyone can forget how bad the trial years were Parenting is like any other skill it takes practice Except it's the most difficult one to master And who knows maybe marriage is like that too Except no one sticks around long enough to where they're decent at it If you said that being with someone wasn't worth it, why did you choose to go out? Because I wondered if I was wrong Were you? We'll find out Um I have to go to the restroom Right? Me too. Too much wine Hi Finn, Hi Cosmo, Hi Finn Why... Why'd you say that twice? Did you boys work hard? Yeah, you wouldn't believe it Ms. Dula, we sold every brownie Great I knew they'd like it. I always put in my own extra special ingredient It makes my brownies stand out above the rest Is it love? I was thinking more along the lines of Cigarette butts? Mom not again! I can't believe you put drugs in these brownies Why are you so upset? It got you in the Boy Scouts and it worked here, what is the problem? Mom, you can't keep doing this it's - it's embarrassing Oh, Bobert. You'll have the whole ride home to complain. Come on. Bye! Do you really think she did? Well I mean was a little convenient how everyone showed up at once Either way it worked. That's all that matters right? Let's grab some milkshakes and count the money. 1,200 1,200? That's not even half And accounting for Ms. Dula's cut that's 1104 dollars So tonight was basically a waste. No, Finn don't think about it like that Tonight was a victory. You know, we're one step closer to getting you to your goal Yeah, but time is dwindling we have to think fast We're doing the best we can. Yeah, but I feel like we could be doing more, you know I mean I read somewhere that broke college girls will sit on birthday cakes in front of a webcam to make money, you know Maybe that can work Finn, that's ridiculous Okay, you're right I mean, where would we get a birthday cake at this time of night? Mom what are you doing here? Finn, Kate. I was seeing a friend. What are you doing here? We just came for shakes after the bake sale. We're counting the money Hi Ms. Conwell. Hi Cosmo Well, how'd it go? Meh He's down because we only made $1,200 $1,200 from a bake sale? Ms. Dula sure whips up a mean batch Ms. Dula. I bet she does. Wait you didn't have any did you? Nah Mom we still have $3,400 to go. I don't know what we're gonna do Well you guys, are smart kids, you'll think of something Kate how's the scratching going? Good girl. Hey one last thing Father Flynn called earlier had some Church tax questions And he won't return my calls. Did you see him tonight? Uhhh, I'm just sure he's Wiped out after today All right Well, I'm headed off to the loo Why'd I say it like that? Your mom's nice Uh, my mom is weird Okay. Well, maybe that's where you get it from Well, hey guys Mr. Hollenbeck. What are you doing here? Well, you know that date I had last week. I guess it went pretty well So you're out celebrating? With another date Congrats! We have some news What's that? We raised eleven hundred dollars to open the ring back up Eleven hundred? No way. All this money's for the rink? And we're not through yet.

Exactly But Those are always for like Nonprofits or educational institutions and They're always something so low like 15% Which is why we're in luck My dad owns a bar downtown remember, so maybe I can pull a few strings You know alcohol is expensive the place is poppin. And since it's my dad, he'll probably give us a better deal than any other establishment You're onto something I'll make a few calls All right any ideas?

This is sure gonna be anticlimactic Hey, Mr. Hollenbeck what happens if there's no one here to compete with me?
