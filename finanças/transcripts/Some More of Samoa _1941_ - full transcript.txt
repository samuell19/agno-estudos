[♪] Oh, nurse, how's my husband this morning? How is he? Did I come here to nurse a patient, or that silly-looking tree he has in there? Well, that's a rare tree, and worrying about it has brought on his nervous breakdown. Hm, well, I shouldn't wonder. I've been running errands for it all morning. "Give it a drink, give it some air, put it in the sun, take it out of the sun." Just be patient. I'm going to call a doctor. You'd better get six doctors. My feet are killing me. MAN: Nurse! [HUFFS] MAN: Nurse! Nurse! Mr. Winthrop, I-- A fine gardener you are. Look at that tree. The only puckerless persimmon in the country, and you're letting it die. But I didn't -- Shut up! Say something. Oh! Call for the tree surgeons at once. Get out. And when they come, you can go. You're fired. Nurse! Nyuck, nyuck. Mmph! [SQUEALS] Lubazac. Lubazac. Lubazac. Whozica. Whozica.

I don't like the sound of its bark. [BARKING] Ooh. [TICKING] Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. What is it? Two o'clock. Why, I... Ohh! [WHIMPERS] Needs a transfusion. Certainly. A transfusion is less confusion. What's this? Oh, just a little thing I picked up to make big trees out of little saps. Don't look at me. [RUMBLING] It's magic. Certainly, before you know it, we'll have fruit. Look. "Raspbereenies." Oh, boy. Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck-- Oh! [BARKS] [RINGS] ♪ Hello ♪ ♪ Hello ♪ ♪ Hello ♪ Dr. Howard, Dr. Fine, Dr. Howard.

But, doctor, you can't operate here. Are you gonna tell us our business? Ask her to leave. Outside. All right, come on, lady. But, doctor-- LARRY: Outside 'till after the operation. Oh, they're going to operate. Operate? This is a plain case of dry rot. Cut off that limb. They're gonna cut off his leg. You're not gonna cut off any limb. Put that saw down. Sit down. We know our business. MOE: Hold him. Cut off that limb. Nurse! [GROANING] Oh, stop it! Stop it! [INDISTINCT SPEECH] That's one of 'em. What about the other one? [GASPS] You vandals. You've ruined my persimmon tree. I've waited 15 years for it to bear fruit. You have? Where's its mate? Mate? It has no mate. It's the only one like it in the country. You ain't gonna get anywhere with a single tree. This poor thing is pining away for a girlfriend. Or maybe a boyfriend. Quiet. Are you sure? CURLY: Certainly. Gentlemen, if you'll find me a mate for it, I'll pay you $10,000. We're on our way. Where is it? On the isle of Rhum Boogie.
