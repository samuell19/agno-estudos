Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. The Human Rights Watch is certain that there will be more killings once the names of officials suspected of drug trafficking is made public. Those who want the list published argue it would serve as a lesson to everyone. It just proves that the administration will not spare anyone in its campaign against illegal drugs. The organization insists that many of those in the list have become victims of summary executions, as the government’s war on drugs escalates. The Department of Interior and Local Government has ordered district officials to work with them in drug clearing operations by implementing the Barangay Anti-Drugs Abuse Council or BADAC. Non-compliance may lead to administrative charges. Somebody was shot! Dharna! It’s All Souls' Day and they’re killing people. What’s new? Oh God, poor Ronron. Ronron? The guy who was gunned down. You mean the baker’s nephew? The teenager with a pointed nose? He has a mole on his crotch. He frequented my salon. He owes me money. Slut! You made out with him, didn’t you? Biba, watch your dirty mouth. But how did you know he has a mole on his crotch? Well... I consulted a psychic. Flirt! Have some respect for the dead! I’ll get some of those. Me too. I’ll pay you next week. You still owe me money! Come on. I’ll pay you. How many kilos? Just a quarter. Give me the ones for grilling. Just a reminder! We are strictly enforcing a curfew from 10 PM until 5 AM! Dharna, good thing you passed by. I need a haircut! Oh really? You still owe me from the last time. I’ll pay you tomorrow! Yeah, right! Checkpoint. Checkpoint? Dharna, can you give my nephew a haircut? He has a job interview. No big deal. It’s on me. Thank you! Dharna, send me some load! Go and ask your Mom for it! You ignored me yesterday. Now you’re asking for load? Dharna! Hey. Where have you been? Ask your Mom. I’ve been running errands for her. Will this be done in time? We need to be at the bar by noon for the rehearsal. It will be. Just leave it to me. There will be celebrity judges, including Ogie Diaz. I don’t want to fail. When did I ever let you fail? Don’t stress yourself. Go and take a bath. Okay. Thank you! Why is this here? Ma’am? Ma’am. Ma’am, here it is. Your newly-dressed Santo Niño. Cute, right? Why is he wearing red? For a change. He always wore green. What’s that? That’s his bag, Ma’am. For good fortune. It’s nice. Take it back. I don’t like it. Ma'am... But he looks nice. Look. Maybe for you. I’m the one praying the rosary to him, not you. He’s an eyesore! You make everything gay, even Santo Niño. Are you okay? Of course. Run after your Mom. She’s on her period again. Ma... Dharna, be patient with my Mom. She lost in a card game and is in a bad mood. Maybe she would like me more if I had a vagina. Even if you had three vaginas, you’ll never be a woman to her. Don’t waste your time on her. Dharna! What? Bitch! Have you seen this? What's this? You are on the watch list. What watch list? Our district just released an updated list of suspected junkies here. Your name is included. Let me see. Where? There. That’s your real name? This is not me, Biba. You are the only Panfilo Macaspac Jr. that I know here in District 124. Where did you get this? I’m dating a district officer. For real? Who? Doesn’t matter. But bitch, that's legit. No, this isn’t. Madam Chair knows me. I cut her hair regularly. I even give her facials. She knows I’m clean. What happens if you’re on the watch list? The police will call you for questioning. You’ll have to take a mandatory drug test. Then go and take the test. For sure it will come out negative. You’re still in danger. Some say it’s actually a hit list. Most of the names there end up dead. Ronron’s name was on the previous list. Dharna! I’m going to be late for my rehearsal. Is that what you only care about? What if I get killed? Stop it. Everybody knows that you’re not a junkie. Why would you get killed? Last week, a student who was mistaken for a junkie was killed by the police. That kid was a junkie. The dailies just wanted to vilify the police. What if I get in trouble with the police? I need to speak to Madam. Wait for me here. Make it fast. Is Madam here? Thank you. Those panties are mine! No, they’re not! But you’re pregnant! Your belly is too big! Stop it. You’re hurting me. Shut up, both of you! You’re getting on my nerves! Go home. We’ll just conduct an investigation to find out the rightful owner of those panties. These panties are mine. No. You stole them from me. Quiet! I’ll keep these panties here while our investigation is ongoing. Madam, I only have three pairs of panties. Don’t take them away. Try washing your other panties. You still have two pairs. Use them alternately. Or don’t wear any, I really don’t care. These panties will stay here until your case is settled. Now, leave. I am so close to pulling out all your pubes. Leave! Raul! Madam! Come with me. Sign your names here. Good morning, Madam. Dharna. What brings you here? It’s like this, Madam. My name... Madam? Madam, you have a call. Hello? Where’s Connie? What? Then call her. Damn it, Manolo. Do I have to do it for you? Madam, you see, my name... Damn it. I’m running late. I’m attending a mass at the Mayor’s house. There’s a party afterwards. How’s my makeup? It still looks good, Madam. Come, help me get dressed. There. I'll put it here, Madam. Here. Zip me up. Smooth out the creases. Yes, Madam. My shoes please. Shoes? Yes. This pair, Madam? Okay. They're backwards. Sorry, Madam. What are you doing here, anyway? Madam... I saw my name on the district watch list. There, Madam. This is confidential. Who gave you this? It was being passed around, Madam. Come here. Yes, Madam. How did this leak? Where did you get this? I can’t trust any of you. You’re all dimwits. Madam. Madam. Madam. Am I in danger? They say that those in the watch list get killed. Don’t believe the news. Most of them are lies. The president only wants to solve the drug problem at the district level. He wants officials to report suspected junkies in their district. Make sure Atty. Reyes gets this. Yes, Ma’am. Madam, I am not a drug addict. Do you know who put my name on the list? I don’t recall. I’ve been so busy. How would I know that you’re Panfilo Macaspac, Jr? But if you’re innocent, why would your name be in the list? Madam, I’m really innocent. Believe me. Madam, please help me. What can I do to get my name out of that list? I will give you free haircuts for a year. Including free manicures and pedicures. That’s quite insulting. Are you bribing me? No, Madam. Of course not. I just want to clear my name. You know what, Madam, my father is proud that even though I’m gay, I’m not a junkie. And now this? I might get in trouble with the police. I beg of you, Madam. The police won’t bother you if you’re not doing anything illegal. Madam, I didn’t mean to insult you. What did she say? All candidates, proceed to the stage now so we can start rehearsing. Dharna. Dharna. Why does it feel loose? Dharna! What size is this? My dick won’t bulge. Let’s not fool each other, Zeus. Your dick won’t bulge even if you use a kid’s underwear. Why are you so cranky? What do you want me to do? Do you want me to rejoice for making it to the watch list? If you’re that worried, then let’s move to a new place. Problem solved. As if it’s that easy. My salon is here. If we leave, I will lose all my customers. Madam? Hello, Madam? Madam! Yes, Madam. Yes, Madam. I know where that is. OK, Madam. I’m on my way. Thank you, Madam. Thank you. Madam wants to see me. You’re leaving? What about my costume? I’ll be right back. We have enough time. I’ll be quick. Just go straight ahead. Thank you. Let's release it. We’re not releasing the body until they pay us. She’s putting a down payment. What about the remaining balance? We’ll probably never hear from her again. The family is pleading. We have been keeping the body for a month now. Let’s release it. We don’t have enough space for all the dead bodies here. Dharna! Come here! Don’t be upset. There were a lot of people around us earlier. It wasn’t the place to talk about the watch list. This is Manolo, my husband. This is Dharna. He will be helping us. Good afternoon, Sir. Do you know how to put makeup on the dead? Oh he’s good. Extremely good. Can you start today? We won’t have any problems. He works fast. Okay then. Just get Connie’s kit from the cabinet. I have to go. Think about what I said. Madam, what is happening? Connie, our stupid makeup artist here, suddenly did not report for work today. That’s why I missed Mayor’s party. Good thing you agreed to sub for her. Come. Madam? Come have some refreshments. Work on those bodies and I’ll connect you with the person who put your name on the watch list. But... that doesn’t mean you’re absolved. You still need to prove that you’re not a junkie. Madam, can I just appeal my case to you? We have a process to follow. We can’t take shortcuts. You know, the list hasn’t been submitted yet to the national police. So you still have time to settle your problem. By the way, it’s the General’s birthday tomorrow. And of course I am invited. For sure we’ll talk about the list and all the names in there. I just noticed almost all of them got shot in the face. Why don’t we just tell their families to keep the casket closed? Oh no. They get more donations if guests can see their dead. If you don’t want to, I won’t force you. I just wanted to help you with your problem. Hello? Where are you? You said you’d be quick. I can’t leave just yet. Madam asked me to do something. What about my wings? Zeus, isn’t the show at midnight? Stop pressuring me. I’ll take care of it. You don’t know what I am going through. I’m already 30. This will probably be my last big night. I need to win this, especially since Ogie Diaz is judging. You know what that means? The meaning of what? Of Ogie Diaz judging. Does that really mean anything? Of course! It means... that he’s gay? Dharna, he’s always been gay! I know. The whole country knows it. So what’s your point? He is a starmaker, Dharna. He might be looking for a new talent! This is my chance. Hello? Dharna? Hello? You’re still alive? Don’t scare me! Why? There’s a rat. They don’t bite. They’re always full. Madam sent these snacks. Wow... looks like they’re just asleep. But why is he wearing shades? That’s the best I can do, Madam. Is that Gucci for real? This is nice. It fits me perfectly. Oh well, let’s just give this to the dead, so he’ll look posh. You are really good. Do you want to work here? I already have a job, Madam. Here, you won’t run out of work. Especially now that business is booming. Madam, I like having chitchats with my clients. Think about it. You’ll love our clients. You never hear them complain. Madam... how do we go about my case? You said I can make an appeal? Fine. A promise is a promise. Come with me. You’re from Area 2, right? Yes, Madam. It’s the biggest, but also poorest area in our district. Illegal drugs are rampant there. Mr. Roja is the president of Area 2. He was probably the one who listed you. He can’t hear well, so speak up when you talk to him. What should I say, Madam? It’s up to you. Just make a moving speech. He’s the principal of Makopa Elementary School. It’s near. Just meet him there. But there are no classes today. He’s there, finishing his syllabus. He’s waiting for you. One more thing. He is allergic to gays. Yes, Sir? Mr. Roja, please. I need your ID. Please write your name here. The principal’s office is on the second floor. Go straight ahead, there are stairs at the far end. Thank you, Sir. Thank you. Mr. Roja? Mr. Roja? I’ll call you back. Mr. Roja! Sir! Mr. Roja! Mr. Roja! Sir! Mr. Roja! Sir... Sir... Jesus Christ! Sorry, Sir. Who are you? Why are you scaring me? I’ve been calling you, Sir. Are you Panfilo? Did Cynthia send you? Yes, Sir. I’ve been waiting for you. But now I have to exercise. Do you want me to leave so you can exercise, Sir? I’ll just come back. Why is your hair like that? It looks rusty. It’s hair color, Sir. Why? Black is beautiful. Don’t change what God gave you. You look gay. Are you gay? I’m not gay, Sir. What’s that? A bag, Sir. I know. You might be hiding some drugs in it. Of course not, Sir! There's none, Sir. I hate drugs. Any kind of drugs. Even if I have diarrhea, I don’t take any drugs. I just drink tea. And pray. I always get better. Why did you stop? Do another round. Sir? Are you deaf? I said do another round. 100 times. You said you wanted to prove that you’re not an addict, right? Go! OK, Sir. When Cynthia called, I prayed hard if I should see you. I heard the voice of God. It is only humans who make the watch list. We make mistakes, despite our good intentions. But what’s one mistake? In any war, a collateral must be offered for the greater good. That is why I asked Cynthia: is he worth my time? I’ll make it worth your time, Sir! Just tell me what I need to do. I’ll take a bath first. There are CCTVs around, so I’d know if you stopped. Remember. CCTV is watching you. Sir, can I take a break for a second? Where’s the CCTV here? Hey. Mr. Roja has already left. What? But he told me... He asked me to tell you to take a drug test. Get back to him once you have the results. Where are you? The rehearsals are starting. Here, Ma’am. Please check if your name is correct. It is. Collect the sample midway, and then bring it to the other window. Thank you. Dharna! Sorry, excuse me. You’re so annoying. I told you not to go here. Don’t you have rehearsals? We’re done. I just need to be back by 11 PM. Don’t fret about your wings. I already called Biba. She’ll go to the bar to finish it. Why, are you not going? I still have to bring the results to that old fuckhead. He made me run around like a horse, only to be asked for a urine test. That won’t take long, right? If I pee fast enough. Where are you going? Where are you going? I have to buy water. That’s already your second bottle. Still nothing? This is it. False alarm. This is it. You sure? No. You’re ruining my game. Sorry. This is really it. Wait for me. Ma’am, what time will I get my results? Tomorrow afternoon. Tomorrow? Yes, at around 5 PM. That long? Sometimes it takes longer. Ma’am, you have a call. Excuse me. Why? I can’t wait any longer. Madam will discuss the list with the General tomorrow. General who? I don’t know either! The point is, I have to take my name out of the list within the day. But you told me to go back here and look for Mr. Roja. I said, get back to him once you have the results. I didn’t say get back here. Sir... I need to talk to him. Please help me. Do you know where he lives? No. Are you sure? I said I don’t know. Damn it. Who are you calling? Madam. Why can’t I contact her? Just relax. How can I relax? Have you seen the morgue? You have no idea. There’s no more space for the dead. Once that watch list reaches the police, I’ll suffer the same fate as the dead. But if you prove that you’re clean, why would they bother you? My cousin was a victim of that watch list. He had stopped using drugs, but they still killed him. If you have an enemy, he can put your name on the watch list even if you’re innocent. He has no enemies. Except for my Mom. What? My Mom would never have you killed. She’ll just have you cursed. Did I say she would? Try going to Alibangbang. Mr. Roja might be there. Alibangbang? The massage parlor? He frequents that place. A lot of people have been seeing him there. Thank you. Thank you. Let's go. Wait. These are yours, right? Thank you. Dharna, let's go. This is him on Facebook. Is he here? I just need to talk to him. Sir, we’re not allowed to disclose any information about our customers. Please? Didn’t you hear what I just said? Nobody has to know. You can have it. You need it more than I do. Sir, don’t mind him. I’ll just have a massage. Thirty minutes. Sir. Please get changed. I’ll be back soon. Jesus Christ, Tess! Pretend like you’re enjoying it. Sir, what are you doing there? Sir... I’m sorry for intruding. What are you doing here? I just need to talk to you, Sir! Get him out of here! But I really need to talk to you, Sir! It’s important! Sir, we’ll call the police! Go ahead! So they’ll know what is really happening here. I saw everything. Let me talk to you if you don’t want trouble. Leave us alone. Sir, I’m really sorry. You junkies are a piece of shit. Are you trying to blackmail me? I’m not trying to blackmail you. And I’m not a junkie. I just want to talk. My drug test results won’t be released until tomorrow. I assure you, it’s negative. So what’s your problem? You have to remove my name from the list before they submit it to the police tomorrow. Sir, I may be poor, but I’m decent. I have a small business. My reputation is everything. But I didn’t put your name on the list. I don’t even know you. But Sir, you’re the president of Area 2, right? I’m a resident there. You’re the only one who can put my name on the list. Are you only registered at Area 2? Panfilo... Panfilo! Panfilo, wait up. Whatever it is... Whatever it is you saw earlier... I’m a good man. Are you trying to convince me? What if I make you run around in circles 100 times and ask for a drug test to prove you’re a good man? Don’t worry. I won’t tell anyone. I don’t give a fuck about you. And don’t you dare call me Panfilo. My name is Dharna. Dharna with an H. Dharna! Foot massage, Sir? Oh no. I’m with him. What a time to get a massage. We’re done here. I’ll just get some lotion. His phone has been ringing constantly. I tried to wake him up as it might be urgent. Sorry, Miss. He really sleeps like a log. [Fuck you! You got me pregnant! Answer my calls!] Just a reminder! Our curfew is from 10 PM until 4 AM! Minors are strictly prohibited from going out. Just a reminder! Our curfew is from 10 PM until 4 AM! Minors are strictly prohibited from going out. Just a reminder! Our curfew is from 10 PM until 4 AM! Minors are strictly prohibited from going out. Just a reminder! Our curfew is from 10 PM until 4 AM! Ghalema, where’s Dad? What a surprise. What’s up? Did you fight with your boyfriend? Don’t get me started. I’m not in the mood. I was minding my business until you showed up. Bullshit. Dad... Dad! Do you see what I see? An apparition. Vholta, stop tattooing Dad. That’s why people think he’s a junkie. Shut up. Did you visit your Mom? No. I’ll just visit her on her birthday. I hope she haunts you. Light a candle for her at the chapel. It’s All Souls' Day, right? Dad, please. It's so messy here. I’m going through a lot now. You only go here when you have a problem. Vholta, stop it. You’re annoying me. Isn’t it true? Why are you here, then? Girls, dinner time! Are those cooked enough? Of course. You only get one stick. I didn’t know you were coming. Ghalema, watch your words. I’m telling you. What’s your problem? Add another line here. The entire arm, Dad? Dad... Let's eat. Vholta, come on. Okay. Rice, please. Hey. Are you just going to sit there? Let’s eat. I’m on the watch list. Damn it. Have you been called for questioning? The police hasn’t received the watch list yet. I saw it ahead of them. Fuck. Are you an addict? I told you, I can accept your being gay. Just don’t taint our name. I’m not an addict, Dad! You know me. Then why are you in the watch list? You know, Darna the superhero, she’s probably a junkie too. And her sidekick Ding is her supplier? True! That’s why Darna always shouts: Ding... give me the stone! Stop it! Don’t make me hit you. Your sister’s situation is no joke. That watch list has already claimed lives! I’ll fix it, Dad. As you should. It’s our name that’s on the line. I know. The district might revoke Ghalema’s scholarship, too. They can have it. They are just giving us pittance. They can shove it up their ass! Stupid! You ingrate! Ghalema. Be thankful the district is giving you 500 pesos every month! Do you know how many pedicures I have to give to earn that amount? Damn it! Why did you have to hit me? You’re really asking for it! Stop it! You animals! That’s enough! Zeus suggested… that we should just move away. To get away from it all. Your boyfriend… is really dumb, isn’t he? Going away is an admission that you’re indeed an addict! Don’t you know anyone who can help you? I’m told it was the president of Area 2 who put my name on it. I went to him earlier. Why? You just moved there. Area 5 is where you grew up in. That was my mistake. Do you know who our president here is? It’s Melba. Your mom’s midwife. I’ll call her later. Vholta, is this yours? Bitch… I haven’t worn this yet. Looks like you got it from a thrift store. Let me borrow it. I’m so sweaty. Sorry, Mom. I wasn’t able to visit you. If ordinary people could be saints, Mom would definitely be one. She had no vices. And she never swore. Kind people die early. Nothing to worry then. Even if they kill you, you’ll still rise up from the grave. Very funny. Sis… Why is your boyfriend texting me, and asking if you’re here? Don’t reply to him, Ghalema. So I was right. You had a fight. Sis, your boyfriend’s work makes you vulnerable to diseases. We always get tested. We’re healthy. What did you fight about? He has another woman? Am I right again? That’s nothing. Of course he’ll look for a girl. Deal with it. As long as he doesn’t get her pregnant. That’s a dealbreaker. What the fuck? Are you a psychic? So he did?! I read a message from his girl. Asking him to marry her. Well and good. You can give that girl the job of feeding Zeus’ family. Idiot. Sis, did you really think your relationship would last? I’m talking to Melba now. Are you meeting her? Miss Melba? Miss Melba? Help me out, bro! It's coming out! It hurts! She’s going to see Melba. Melba? This way. Take care of her, bro. What? But wait! Don’t you have anyone with you? Isn’t it obvious? Sorry. Miss Melba! It hurts! Miss Melba! Miss Melba! Let’s go inside! Come on! Okay, push. Open your legs wider! I need a… I need a hand here. Stay with your wife while I finish this. What about this, Miss Melba? Where do I put this? Can you get it from him? Me? Just get it! Wait a second. Hurry. Move! Push harder! Get a blanket and cover your wife! I need a hand here. Hey! Eyes on your wife! She’s not my wife. I only met her outside. Then just help me out! How’s her vagina? And cover her up! How’s her vagina? Come on. So how’s your vagina? Three… Four… Five… Remove her panties! Check her vagina! Remove her panties? Yes! Tell me if there’s blood coming out! It smells! It really smells! Push harder. It won’t be long now! Melba! Help my wife first! What do you think I’m doing? Miss Melba, attend to her first... Excuse me, can I get the name... She’s Linda! Not her. You. What’s your name? Joshua, I’m Joshua. Joshua. Yes. Hi Joshua. I’m Dharna. You scums! Can’t you see, I’m working?! Save the chitchat for later! Push! Is it over, Melba? Oh my. He’s so cute. Joshua, he looks like you! Of course! I think he also looks like me. I could be his mom. Get him. Can I be his mom? Move! Wait! You smell good, baby. Oh, no. We have a problem. The baby’s head is too big for her pelvis. I can’t stand it any longer! Hold on, we’re here. Nurse! Slowly. It’s killing me! Slowly. You’ll be okay. Nurse! Nurse! Miss Melba, where’s the old woman? Thanks. Who? The one who almost fainted. She owns these. There was an old woman at the ER. But she left already. Ma’am, excuse me. How is Elsa doing? She and her baby are safe. Ma’am, are you the midwife? Yes. Do you have a license? No, I don’t. But my Mom and Grandma were midwives. I learned from them. What you’re doing is illegal. I know. That’s what I tell my patients. But they’re insistent. I’ll let this pass. Just don’t do this again. You can be jailed for this. I will only stop if you’ll admit them even if they can’t pay. But if you’ll reject them, then I must help them. Never mind if I go to jail. Wow, that doctor is hot. That was a solid speech. Just like in the Miss Universe. Wait... who are you again? I’m Lando’s son. Dharna. With an H. Dharna... Right. Lando called me up. Is this about your inclusion in the watch list? Yes. Madam Cynthia told me that… it’s the area presidents who put the names of junkies on the list. I thought… Maybe you were the one who put my name on it. Since I used to live in Area 5. It wasn’t me. In fact, ever since they rolled out BADAC. BADAC? Barangay Anti-Drug Abuse Council. All area presidents are required to report there. But not once did I submit a list to them. A lot of innocent people could get in trouble because of it. Look at you. If it wasn’t you who put my name on the list, who else could it be? Didn’t Cynthia tell you? In some areas, they use a drop box. Anyone can drop an entry, and tag any person as an addict. No proof. That’s what happened to you. Do you know which areas are using a drop box? Why, are you going to visit each of them? Yes, if I have to, just to clear my name. This is not the right way to clear your name. You’ll be in danger. I will be in greater danger if my name remains on that list. Dharna... You have no idea what you are getting yourself into. You better stop. Can’t you really help me? Listen. Leave this place for now. Once you’re tagged as an addict, true or not, no one can tell what they’ll do to you. Good thing you still remember me. Holy fuck! Holy fuck indeed. How dare you light a used candle for me. Mom? Is that really you? Are you haunting me? You ingrate. I have all the right to haunt you. You forgot to visit me at the cemetery, and you only pray to me when you have a problem. I ran out of people to ask for help, Mom. Pray to God. Not to me. Was I the one impregnated by the Holy Spirit? And you have the audacity to ask for help. You never even helped me when I was still alive. Why are you like this? Are you mad at me, Mom? Of course not. I am thrilled to see you, you motherfucker. Damn it, what do you think? You left me! You just left me to die! Mom, that’s not true. We did everything. We asked everyone for money just to save you. And? Were you able to save me? You and your sisters are useless, just like your wretched Dad. You shitheads. Mom, watch your mouth. What happened to you? Since when did you learn to curse? And to smoke? Do they allow that in heaven? Stupid. Would I be this angry if I got into heaven? You animal! You’re in hell, Mom? But why? You were a church devotee, you were always serving Father... So the rumors were true? You were Father’s lover? It only happened once. And I was sent to hell right away? How about my good deeds? I accepted my sons being gay! It should count for something. Wasn’t that enough to get me into heaven? You make it sound like it’s my fault. You should have complained. Moron! You think I didn’t? Damn it! Even in the afterlife, nobody listens to us. You die poor, and then they burn you in hell. Why do we even strive to be good people? Fuck. Fuck all of them! Are you all excited? Yes! Let’s start the show with candidate number 1! Dharna! There’s your man. What took you so long? Long story. Whatever. Good evening, everyone! I am Zeus Bola, the sharpshooter of Big Papa! I believe in the saying: What looks good, tastes good, just like my dick. You liar, you said you’d be back early. I was the one who finished his wings. I’m sorry! I’ll make it up to you, I promise! Yeah, right. So, were you able to solve your problem? No. I think this day is cursed. I don’t know who else to turn to. Why don’t you try talking to Madam again? At this hour? She’s probably asleep. Dope! There she is! She’s one of the judges? Yes. She’s one of the new owners of this bar. Wait. Madam... Oh, it’s you again? Madam, I met with the person you referred... He didn’t put my name on the watch list. I was told somebody must have put my name in the drop box. Do you know which areas are using a drop box? Madam, I am running out of time. Please. Can’t you see, I’m busy? Let’s just talk tomorrow. Madam... Madam... Madam, l’m willing. Stop pestering me! I’ll work for you for a month. I’ll do the makeup for all your corpses. For free. Make it three months. And then train your replacement. It's a deal, Madam. Just please help me. Raul! Madam! Ask around. Find out which areas used a drop box. Yes, Madam. Thank you, Madam. Just wait for Raul. Stop bothering me. Thank you, Madam! Are you a dog? Why? I’d love to doggy-style you! Madam... What do you want now? The candidates are all good, aren’t they? Especially Zeus, the one with a pair of wings. Are you joking? He’s too old. He’ll never win. You like bananas? Why? Mine is so large it will make you gag. Zeus... Hey. I thought you forgot about me. Dumbass. If you’re going to cheat, you should hide your cellphone from me. I was planning to tell you. When? I don’t love her. It doesn’t matter, you’re having a baby with her. Are you going to leave me? Do you want me to? No, I don’t. I feel the same way, Zeus. But I won’t pay a dime for your child. Do you think I only want your money? I don’t mind if you only need me for money. But I have nothing to give. Dharna! Someone’s looking for you. His name and address are there. He’s waiting for you. Is this the former actor? Exactly. He’s the president of Area 8. He’s the only one using a drop box lately. What are you waiting for? Go. Thank you. What was that about? Madam gave me a new contact. He’s probably the one I’m looking for. You’ll leave at this time? It’s dangerous. I need to settle this before morning. Do your best. You’re one of the favorites. Really? Says who? I just overheard it. How many months along? Nine months. Hey! Where do you think you’re going? To Area 8. You might be hiding some drugs. Then go ahead and frisk me. Some hide it in their ass. Go and check him. Don't rush me. Sir, that’s my friend. We work at the bar. Which bar? Big Papa. That’s where we work. The gay bar? What’s funny? Madam Cynthia owns it. Do you want to be summoned to her office? Just go. Why are you here? To keep you company. Why? I don’t want to worry. You might be in danger. How about your Big Night? Forget it. I’m not going to win, anyway. Why? Do you think I have a chance? Dumbass. You shouldn’t even ask that question, Zeus. Sorry. Don’t worry. I’m OK. Really? Yes. If you’re really OK, give me a kiss. Don’t be stupid. Just one kiss. Don't worry. I promise. One day, you will win a title. Promise? Which house, Dharna? Just up ahead. Show us your bags. Okay. Who lives here? Quiet. Hello, Ma’am. Madam Cynthia sent us here. We were only expecting one. Which one is Dharna? I am. But I’m with him. Only you can enter. I’ll just see you later... Ma’am, if I can’t join him, then we’ll just leave. Thank you. What are you saying? I don’t like this. Fine. Get in, both of you! Make it quick. He’s been waiting. Just come with me. Who are we meeting? You'll see. This way. Dharna... Is this the house of Donato Rapido? I’ve seen all his movies when I was a kid! Cocky Cowboy... Especially this, Cocky Cowboy! I remember all his lines! You’re not that excited, are you? Look at your eyes. Good thing I insisted on coming along. Let’s take a selfie with him later. Hey. No selfies allowed. Donato has an official photographer. Let’s go. Come on. He’s here. Donato boys... Pack up! What a presence, he’s glowing. Motherfucker, turn off the light! It’s too bright! It’s just lights. Which one is Dharna? I am. I had high expectations when I heard your name. Why do they call you Dharna? They say I’m good at swallowing. What do you swallow? Me, Sir. Zeus, Sir. Your number one fan, Sir! Cocky Cowboy... Cocky Cowboy, it’s time to surrender! We got your horse now! You can’t escape! No, I won’t surrender! You may have gotten my horse... but never my courage. We also got Petula! Surrender now or we will kill her! Help... Help... No... Not my beloved Petula! Pe... Tu... La... He’s so good! And that’s how he won Best Actor at the Metro Manila Film Festival! Did you like it? Sir… My dream of becoming an actor just came true tonight. Sir... You are my greatest idol, Sir! Sir... Sir... are you done? Are you done playing cowboys? Sir, can we now talk about why I’m here? Oh, right. You want your name taken out of the watch list. Because I’m not an addict, Sir! Is he telling the truth, Zeus? Yes, Sir. It’s true. Well then, you have a lot of explaining to do. This is the drop box that I made for my Area 8 constituents. With this, residents can anonymously submit the names of junkies in their area. Sir, I’m not from here. I am not your resident. I know. But I can’t just dismiss what people put in my drop box. See for yourself. Read the names that have been submitted. Read it aloud. Say it out loud. Don’t be shy. This is just between us. Really, Sir? They may look suspicious, but you can trust them. Ask them who they trust. Come on. Ask them. Who do you trust? Donato! Who? Donato! See? Do you still doubt me, Dharna? Come on. Read it to me. This also has your name. And this. PANFILO MACASPAC JR. AREA 2 ADDICT What fucker did this? I don’t think it’s the work of just one person. See? You understand now why I included your name in the watch list? A lot of people are saying you’re an addict. I’m just an ordinary person, Sir. I don’t know why anyone would waste time falsely accusing me. It must be the work of junkies. They were probably high and wanted to prank you. You know what. Let’s help each other. You need something from me. I need something from you. What is it, Sir? I have a job for you. But don’t ask questions. In return, I’ll have your name removed from the list. No questions asked. Really, Sir? I’ll do anything you want. Good. Divina will explain everything to you. Should I include him? Why not? You want to be an actor, right? This is your chance. Stay right here while we’re loading the vehicle. I need to talk to Donato. Ma’am, where are we going? I’ll tell you later. You careless motherfucker! You idiot! Move faster! We’re in a hurry! Sorry, Ma’am. Stupid! You’re all useless! Hurry! Get in! Come on! You’re in critical condition. You had a heart attack. And you, you’re hysterical. Your acting should be believable so we can get past the checkpoint. We’re almost there. Be ready. But why should I be hysterical? What’s my motivation? What? Can I just cry silently? Let them see the pain through my eyes? Like my idol John Lloyd. He acts with his eyes. Like this. I don’t give a damn if you want to act with your eyes or your nose. Just make the police believe we’re rushing to the hospital so they won’t inspect the ambulance anymore. Clear? We’re near. Wait. I’m not feeling it yet. Are you feeling it now? Good morning, Sir! Good morning. Routine checkpoint. Fight for your life! He had a heart attack, Sir. Don’t leave our kids! Don’t leave me! Heart attack or epilepsy? Why is he having a seizure? Please help us! Go! He might die here! Help us! Hey. Enough. It’s over. We got past them. Sorry. I got carried away by the character. Especially when you started convulsing. Really? It just came out naturally. Damn, that really shattered me. Your cry was so moving. I started crying too. Was I holding you too hard? It’s okay. It’s okay. Was I really good? They’re OK. Are you proud of us? Amateurs. She’s busy. Did you like me doing this? I was surprised. It just came naturally. You were good! Did you like it, Ma’am? Sorry. Get out. Where are we? I’ve never been to this place. Donato. Hey. I heard you gave an award-winning performance. That was one of the strictest checkpoints and you got past it. Are we good, Sir? Does this mean you’re removing my name from the watch list? I already called Cynthia. You have nothing to worry about. Thank you, Sir. Thank you very much. You two are reliable. Let’s continue working together. I’m running for mayor next election. I already have a slogan: “Mayor dreams come through with Donato.” Brilliant, right? Right? I think you can help me. You want to make big money, right? What kind of work, Sir? The same thing. Do you even have to ask? I can’t do it, Sir. You already did. It feels so good, right? We’re friends now. You can’t just leave me. Sir... There’s nothing to fear. This is just like making a movie. We just give the audience what they want. A little bit of joy. So they can escape their problems for a while. Donato. Wait for me beside the ambulance. I just need to talk to someone. Get those ones first. Hello? Dharna... Sorry, did I wake you up? Who is this? This is Melba, the midwife. I got your number from your Dad. I can't sleep. I feel bad for not helping you. Why are you calling? I need to get this off my chest. Don’t worry about it. The truth is, I know who you should see. There’s only one area that uses a drop box. Its president is a suspected pusher. Who’s that? He pretends to hate drugs so people won’t suspect. The residents know about it but no one wants to talk. There are rumors that this man is a big-time pusher. He earns millions from selling drugs. I don’t want to give you his name. You might look for him. It would only put your life in grave danger. Dharna...? Are you still there? Hello? Everything is there. Everything we agreed on. Let’s lie low for a while. Who will win Mr. Hoe-Hoe-Hoe? Who? Here we go. The second runner-up... The second runner-up is contestant number... Who? Contestant number 6! Now... for the grand winner! Who’s your favorite? Number 4? Number 9? 4 or 9? This year’s Mr. Hoe-Hoe-Hoe is candidate number... Number 9! Zeus Bola! Congratulations! And, of course, our first runner up is candidate number 4! Rafael Diaz! Congratulations to the winners! Congrats! Thank you to all our sponsors! Congratulations! Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
