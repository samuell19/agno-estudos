Hey. Hi. I'm Rachel Apartment 107? Hi. Umm... I'm sorry to bother you but I think someone was in my apartment. Did you see anyone wandering around? No. No. Umm I've gotta pee and I'm kind of too freaked out to go in my place. Yeah, sure, come on in. It's right there. Thank you! You're a lifesaver. Yeah, no problem. Those are pretty. Snapdragons They don't look dragon-y. They were originally used to study genetics. God! The view from your place is so much nicer than mine! What's this? That's my job! Um, just don't Don't touch that. Okay! Do you design apps? I work in biotech. We, I, designed this device. It's called an anonymizer. What's it for? Uhmm... There's this tiny area in the back of your brain in the fusiform gyrus that lights up when you recognize a face. And the anonymizer causes most people's brains to just keep firing the pattern of the last face they saw over and over, even if it's just a photo, burns it out wipes it. But there's a cascade effect the memories that you have of the person associated with that face, they... vanish too. Deleted Names, events, moments, their voice, Gone. That sounds really fucking awful! Yeah, well, I... I mean, it could be used by people to extract themselves from dangerous situations. Hostages, stalkers By... by erasing their memories! Okay, it's a little more complicated than that. I'm, I'm so sorry I didn't mean to insult your job. It's fine, you don't need to constantly apologize. I'm gonna - I'm gonna go talk to the other tenants. It was nice to meet you. Yeah, you too! God! I'm so sorry! It's fine, I got it! I got it Shit! I have to take this. Hey! Charlie, what's up? I'm at the lab now. Where are you? You're at your apartment? What's going on? Goddamnit! You need to get it back here ASAP, okay? It's not a library book, it's a fucking weapon! I'm logged in right now, I can see you've armed it! Fuck! I'm sending a car, okay? Just get it back here, I'm not going to jail for you. I got it! Yeah! Bye What the goddamn fuck is this? Put that down. This is me! And this is you! This is us! Stop, stop! Stop! STOP! Have you pulled this shit before? To me? To you, only once. Look at me! Who the fuck are you? That's mine. What's your name? Alex. As requested, I'm here to escort you from the bus stop. I am so excited to see you and put my arms around you. Today is six months! We have officially been dating longer than anybody you've ever dated. And umm... This afternoon I saw some guy trying to walk a cat near our building on a leash! It was beautiful. I think this is your bus at the end of the block! I'll see you soon. Bye!
