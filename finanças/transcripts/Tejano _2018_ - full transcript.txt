Couple thousand, huh? What, another one of your little bonuses? Oh, yeah. There have been some bonuses at work lately. You really gotta be careful with that shit, you know? Yeah. Yeah, I heard that shit before. What's your abuelo think about you leaving, anyway? I haven't told him yet. You don't need no shit. What's he ever done for you? What, you mean, besides raising me from the age of ten after my parents died? Yeah, besides that. He taught me how to shoot. What-- Oh, shit! Holy fuck!

How much you got saved, man? I don't know, enough to get Lorena across, and maybe-- In dollars, wey? I don't know, eight grand, maybe a little more. ( scoffs ) Eight grand? You got eight grand saved and you made me buy the beer today? You are a fuckin' asshole, dude. Well shit. Sounds like you would've been set. Not anymore though, I mean, what's your old man got again? Fuckin' tumor in his lung. Man, that shit is expensive. ( harsh chuckle ) No shit. And no health insurance? Dude, you know I don't have any fuckin' health insurance. I mean, what the fuck! You know, I think I could help you out. Yeah, and how's that? With that kind of cash, man, we could buy a bunch of cocaine, drive north of Sarita and flip it. Shit, we could do that a few times, man, we'll make some real money. No man, no way. I understand. All I'm saying is, you probably could've had the best of both worlds, that's all. Here you go. Need anything else? ( speaking Spanish ) Yeah, sure. ( New Age music playing ) ( phone ringing ) Javi? Javi? ( phone beeps ) - ( sighs ) - ( dialing phone ) - Duke: What's up dude? - Let's do it.

( man shouting in Spanish ) ( banging on door ) This is the way I found it this morning. I suppose he took everything he thought he could pawn. Hell, he even took six World War II gold pieces from my room. They're worth more than his goddamn car. Duke's always had problems with money... but honestly, I just can't afford to pay his debts anymore. You know that I'd pay you back, every last penny. You know, last several years... ( sighs ) we've just been getting too little rain when we needed it the most... and too much when we didn't. I guess the future's in these damned ugly windmills. Either way, Javi, I... I just can't swing a loan. I just can't. If I find anything of Duke's that's worth something-- Thanks. - Hey. - ( Abuelo speaking Spanish ) Just working, Abuelo, just working. - ( speaking Spanish) - Lorena: Javi? Lorena.

They call the clinic, And Dr. Garcia will tell them the same shit. Then you meet me at the Las Palmas Hotel off the 77 highway. You know where that is? Once you get across, you call me. If anything happens, you call me. If I don't hear from you, if you pussy out or whatever, I'll come fucking find you. The number on the phone is Mom. Hey. ( clicks tongue ) This is important. Once you get on that bridge, you don't stop moving. They stop people who hesitate. Right. But don't go slow either. What the fuck? Hey, what about the money? I'll have the cash with me at the place tomorrow. 10 a.m. ( chatter in Spanish ) ( officer speaking Spanish ) Javi! ¿Que paso? Officer: Passport. Thank you, sir. Let's see. Mr. Ramirez.

Have a good one, take care. Next. Passport. All right, you guys bring anything back from Mexico today? - Man: No, sir. - No? Awesome. All right, you ladies are all set. Thank you so much. - Okay. - Take care. Sir, your passport? - Yeah. Hey, what's up man? - How's it goin'. What happened to your arm? It was a car accident. You didn't have that last week. Yeah, no, it, uh, just a couple days ago in Brownsville. You bringing anything back today? Nope. Went out for a couple beers and tacos. What's going on? - Follow me, please. - W-Why? Just gonna ask a few questions. Dude, I mean, he sees me here every week. I come by-- I go through every week. Go with the agent, please. Sir. Stop. Step back. Hey, what about my passport? ( door opens ) All right, just tell Martinez we'll make that call tomorrow. I'll get back with you. Apologies, sir, but your name was flagged in our system, so according to United States immigration law, I'm gonna have to ask you a few questions.

I dropped out. Well it seems like he's telling the truth. Agent 2: Just a second, Duke. I have a few questions for him. ( clears throat ) What was your business in Matamoros today? Visiting my girlfriend. What's your girlfriend's name? It's none of your business. And you're sure that's your only business in Matamoros? Yes. How'd you break your arm? I was hit by a car. A truck. Got a good look at the driver too. Real fuckin' ugly, probably inbred. Where were you treated, what hospital? Brownsville. Got a note from my doctor here. ( laughs ) Seems a little funny that you'd be walking around with a note from your doctor. I figured you guys would give me trouble here, so I had Doctor-- I had-- I had the doctor write me-- write me one up. You don't know your doctor's name? I was-- I was in a lot of pain. Agent 2: That's a funny-looking cast. And It's got quite a smell too, doesn't it? Doesn't it, Duke? You know, actually I can't really smell it from here. Well, not from over there, you can't. ( sniffing ) Yeah, I'm actually kinda getting over a cold right now, - so I can't really smell shit. - Agent 2: Mm-hmm. Agent 2: I'm gonna have to take a sample of whatever that is on your arm. Well, I'm-- I'm-- I'm pleading the fifth. What's that? I'm pleading the fifth. I-- I want a wa-- I want a warrant, and I want my phone call. ( laughs ) You see son, we haven't let you back in yet. You're in No Man's Land. You aren't a citizen, and you don't have any rights until you cross that little yellow line out there on the linoleum floor that reads, "Welcome to the United States of America." We don't need a warrant, and you don't get a phone call. Now let me see-- What the fuck, man?! Haven't you ever seen a fuckin' broken arm before? All righty. ( snaps fingers ) ( door closes ) ( door opens ) Sir, we have not been satisfied with your answers to our questions, so we're gonna have to ask you to take a sample of that cast. Now why don't you step into this room over here, we can ask you a few more questions. This way.

With the money, and we'll tell them where it is, they can go get it, and that's it. You know, they'll have everything. But why? She'll have the money, she'll have the coke. She's not gonna need me any longer. How do you know that? Well, we need to get the fuck out of here. And you just got the one rifle?
