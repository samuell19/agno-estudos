RUSSIA - BAIKONUR - ARMY RESEARCH BASE WARNING FRANCE - PARIS - ÉLYSÉE PALACE Mr. President, President Putin is on the phone. Gentlemen, the auction is now open. The rules are simple. When I feel that bidding is out of place, I will cut the communication. The last screen lit up wins the chip. 25 million dollars. Secure electronic transfer. We don't even know where the money goes, maximum security for your company. Cheers. DGSE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE Project "Exterminator", the crown jewel of Russian military nanotechnology. When injected into a soldier, Exterminator inhibits neurotransmitters and prevents the formation of prostaglandin in the brain cells. The soldier can fight until death without feeling pain. The Russians have managed to equip their gadget with two milligrams of C4: if the chip doesn't find its gun 12 hours after injection, Exterminator and its host are literally vaporised. So has this chip changed hands in the last 48 hours? Victor Zilenko flew Exterminator to a secret base in Baikonur, Admiral. It immediately went for auction. This is where we come in. President Putin has instructed France to win the auction at all costs. We have the highest offer: 25 million dollars. It's obvious. We're going to form a team to negotiate the transaction. No, Admiral, just to monitor it. Zilenko's demands are clear. He only wants to negotiate with one man: François de la Conche. Sorry? François de la Conche? Yes, de la Conche. Your Quai d'Orsay aristocrat is dangerously rigid. We owe him one of our most bitter failures. Eight years ago in Vienna. Code name: Operation Condor. Aim: Exfiltrate Zilenko. Conche is our cover. To make him trust him, Conche gives his word to Zilenko that he'll be guaranteed freedom. Do you know what? He kept it. Zilenko escaped us. Sorry, gentlemen, it's a non-negotiable demand. Approved by the President. You'll form a team with Mr. de la Conche, who will have withdrawn to his land. To Concherie castle. Pull! Pull! Misfire, Count. Pull! -Misfire, Count. -Pull! -Good, Count! -I'm on form this morning. Pull! Come, dad. So, how's my son-in-law? Pull. Another misfire. I can't hear you! Show him the plans. Watch out! "La Concherie thalassotherapy centre." Really? The ballroom is the perfect place for the shower cubicles. We can easily put about 20 of them. Right? I think he likes it. I'm going to make something classy and profitable, from your old stuff! No more holes! It's a 17th century hole, it's classified 1650, does that mean anything to you? I suppose not. Louis XIV wasn't even 12 yet, and my ancestor, Gaëtan de la Conche, was the leader of the royalist forces. He was loyal to the king and his motto: "For God, and for honour." The rebels led by the Grand Condé mobbed him. He died three days later, victorious but according to his wishes looking God in the eye, in this hole, a symbol of our sense of duty. If there's a Conche alive, this hole will stay a hole. Who's that? I'm warning you, I'm sick and tired of going bankrupt maintaining this castle. My father isn't called "de Something" but he's succeeded through hard work. -That makes you jealous! -No. I'm talking to you about history with a capital H. This isn't the first time our marriage has led to this type of deadlock. Yes, darling. Right. He's armed! -François de la Conche? -Right here. Major Vidal, DGSE. Admiral Mandelieu requires you for a most important mission. Dear old friend. What's the matter, is it the war? Let's not exaggerate, but France needs you. France, you say? I'm your man. But… François! BASCHIERI FICHARD BANK Hello. We're more than 90 days overdrawn. The law requires us to resolve it. I'll just break into my savings, how much is left? Nothing. We emptied it in January to pay off some debts. Yes, of course! I can't save with my interpreter's salary! But in a couple of weeks, I'll be able to manage. I can't wait any longer, okay? When I can't, I can't. And it's not for lack of warning! Do you want me to have an asthma attack in your office? No, Jean-Pierre, no. Please. Not an asthma attack. You know my situation, I've got two ex wives who I pay exorbitant child support to! And a former lover who lends you money. Sonia… -It's the bank's money! -Exactly! -I'm accountable. -Sonia… No, listen… You fix things or I close everything. What do you want to close, Sonia? Come on, you can't do that to the man who took you to Venice! Let's talk about it! I'm still waiting for the money for the tickets. And that, you see, was my money. After this short break, we'll resume the debates… Yes, darling! I promise I'll come to London as soon as I can. No, Punam, it isn't about money! What? Wait, don't go. …between rich and poor countries. No, I'm just snowed under. As soon as I get a break in my crazy schedule, I'll buy a Eurostar ticket. Well yes. I've got to go, I'm being waved at insistently. Yes, I love you too. Well, okay, there's no rush! Don't forget that the range of action of two milligrams of C4 can reach several metres. Any questions about how Exterminator works, also called the Baikonur chip? One question. What is the Baikonur chip? De la Conche, you know our motto and the less you know… The safer I'll be. I know them, indeed. Another question: Have you planned tactical support? The minimum. You'll be totally immersed. I like that. A lot. Have you hired an interpreter? -Not yet. -Even better. I have a request, Admiral. I'd like to work with my friend, Elliot de Saint-Hilaire. He's a great expert in Slavic languages. He's a lovely man who I get on really well with. -Elliot de Saint-Hilaire? -That's right. Tell him it's for a job with François de la Conche. -He'll like that. -No way, Jose! I don't want to work with de la Conche anymore, sir. Be reasonable. You can't reject this offer. Handcuffed to the car of the bloodthirsty Russian he stood up to. De la Conche is rigid, narrow-minded and dangerous. You're putting me in a very embarrassing situation. I'm not the only Georgian translator at UNESCO! Who's the other one? Let's say I might have an idea. Here, you owe me a euro. A weekend in London, Crown Donovan Hotel, everything paid for! My friends, I'm going to have fun. -What language? -From Georgian. -You're really lucky. -I don't know if it's luck. -Anyone for a coffee? -I'd like one. -Yeah, go on. -Have you got change for a 50? So what, I'm asking if you've got any change. -Yeah, okay. -Don't you have any? -I'd really like a coffee. -Do you have change? So you're going to spend a weekend in London? A Georgian translation. -Do you speak it, by the way? -Very, very well. Why am I not on it? -What? -I don't know. Experience, maybe? There you go. Well, have a nice trip. How many times have you been to London this year? I've lost count. -Maybe a dozen times? -Ay, ay, ay. What do you mean? London is the French's favourite place for tax evasion. I have a cousin who works in Bercy and the order there is to take close interest in Paris-London regulars. Do you mean a tax check? I'm afraid so, yes. Tell me, do you take cash in hand? If you take cash in hand, wait… -You too. -Yes. But I'm careful! I haven't been to London this year. Do you understand? You speak Georgian, right. -You… Don't you want to… -What? -Replace me? -No. No, I… I can't. I've got a big job. A meeting with famous diplomats! You can meet François de la Conche. A professional, humble, great guy. I'm not happy about this at all, I'm really doing this to help you. -You… You won't tell Cambalis? -Thanks a million, Jean-Pierre. I'm happy you'll meet him. François de la Conche. -Believe me, you'll remember it! -Even better. What an idiot, that Saint-Hilaire! -So? -That Moindrau, what an idiot! Hello, Punam? I'm coming to see you tomorrow in London. Yes. Wait! No, like this, on a whim. No, don't pick me up at the station, I've prepared a surprise for you. Meet me at… wait. At The Crown Donovan. Ah right, it's got five stars? No, I didn't know, no. Anyway, nothing is too much for the woman I love. Yes. Yes? -Eurostar number 9542… -What are you wearing tonight? Yes, that tight, little dress, you know that… it drives me crazy. Yeah. Ouch! You could say sorry. I'm on the phone. Sorry, that can't be your seat, I'm waiting for someone. Sweetie, can you hear me? I fell on a… On a… No, 35, that's my seat. Look at your ticket. You must be on the wrong coach, it happens a lot. Look, it's coach four, seat 31. There, this is my seat. Ah, François Conche? You're François Conche? De la Conche? Yes. Who am I speaking to? Thank you. Didn't they tell you? Jean-Pierre Moindrau, interpreter. I've replaced Saint-Hilaire. What? Replaced Saint… Why did nobody tell me? He'd like to keep it quiet, which doesn't surprise me. He's got salmonella. -He's on a drip. -On a drip. Anyway… it'll work out! Right, listen… Listen, it's… Listen… Have you ever worked with the Quai d'Orsay, Mr. Moineau? Moindrau. -It's a highly confidential job. -What? A highly confidential job. The slightest error can have consequences so serious you can't even imagine. All clear, Mr. Moireau? Moindrau. Call me Jean-Pierre if you find it difficult. That's to say I wasn't told at all. No, I signed for a small, routine meeting, so, if you want, if it's a high-risk job, it's not the same price at all. Right now… money is no longer an incentive. Speak for yourself! No, listen, I've got two ex wives, I have huge expenses, so it has to fit! You should feel lucky to be working to serve France. Right, listen, Mr. Tronche. Let's settle the money, it'll relax us both. It's strange, I don't have that feeling. Right, we're off. -Colonel. -Colonel. Are you satisfied with the Échelon access code? You are the supplier. -What are you going to offer me? -Exterminator. The Baikonur chip? For 20 million dollars. Welcome to Punamland! Taxi! This is awful. Let me take care of the foreign language stuff. What does that mean? One, never interrupt a gentleman. Two, my English is very good. -There you go. -The man speaks French. Yes, of course. Yes, absolutely. We have a reservation in the name of the company Impex. Look, that girl is gorgeous! Yes, I have it. Churchill suite. -What a body! -What's up with you? -She's cute. -Here are your keys. Enjoy your stay at The Crown Donovan. In what name? Jean-Pierre Moindrau. Sorry, I have nothing in that name. Tell me, Moindrau. We're not on holiday. You don't need a suite for yourself. We're staying for the job and then we'll leave. You won't have time to unpack. -Is that clear? -All clear. It's perfect. Avoid smutty remarks towards women. -We're representing France. -Okay. Forget about the suite. Right? Thanks. Your English is good, but your accent is terrible. Whatever! Have you heard yours? Are you wearing braces? What? Nothing. Nothing else. That's all they have to do. What are you doing? I'm ordering drinks, I'm thirsty. I'll order some for you, I don't like it. Hang up right now, Moindrau! Hang up now! Is there a problem? Call room service back and cancel your order. Are you really putting up a fight over an aperitif? It's paid for by the princess, let's enjoy it. The princess has a name, the French taxpayer. They rob me, I won't mind! I already gave you a price on the Eurostar. It deserves a good compensation. A price? Are you joking? Twice as much as Saint-Hilaire! And Saint-Hilaire… Listen, I'm not here to be yelled at. Let's set out some principles. You do your job, I do mine and that's it. Do you get it? Let me stop you, Moindrau. Let's adopt some principles. No friendly talk between us. Ever. Well, we haven't finished with these idiots. What frequency are we using? 3500 megahertz, Colonel. I'm going to smoke, one moment. JAMMING STARTING Shit! I've got interference! Shit. Piss off. Yes, Punam. Yes, I've arrived safely. Let's meet at 10 p.m. in the hotel bar, we'll have a glass of champagne and then… after we'll have dinner. Wait, don't touch anything, it's back. What the hell is he doing? He's robbing towels. This is a real professional. Why not before? Because I won't be hungry, darling. Yes, the time difference. You know, I've always had bad jet lag. Moindreau! I don't have a towel! -Moindrau! -Oh, roll around on the carpet. Are you there? Moindrau! I don't have a towel! Colonel, there was a break in reception while you were away. That's annoying. For how long? Exactly 47 seconds. Check all the cables. It's 8:20 p.m, serious things will happen in ten minutes. Once the transaction is finished, we dash to the station and leave. Wait, and if I want to stay here? You could have worn a tie. I can't. Ties strangle me. They don't strangle you, they're elegant. Take discreet photos. It's in automatic mode. A photo every five seconds. You press here. So I'm not elegant because I don't wear a tie. Actually, I'm extremely elegant. Okay, just be polite and go open the door. I'm a quadrilingual UNESCO interpreter, I'm not a baron's doorman. Viscount. I'm a viscount. And I'm the Queen of England. Victor. Victor Zilenko. My friend. Turn up the volume. Right away, Colonel. To my friend, without whom I would not be free today. To my French friend. Tell him that nothing is nicer than negotiating with a man of his calibre. And… And I'm very honoured to represent France… Just as I like Georgia, the country with its dull and steep hills of unsuspected beauties that have forged the depth of the Slavic soul. Could you make it shorter? No, I can't. Just translate it. Thank you. He says thank you. -Is that it? -Yes. I think he's in a rush to start the transaction. Right, ok, let's go. Quickly. I want to zoom in. Closer! That's the maximum. Okay. We have the chip. He has it. Yes. He has the chip. If you're successful, we'll save 20 million. You know what to do. Count on us. François. -It's up to you, dear François. -I understood that. In a few seconds… your secure account will be credited with 25 million US dollars. There you go. Perfect. Shit! It's starting again. Shitty equipment, shitty timing. Isn't it coming back? De la Conche? Cheers, Mr. Zilenko. The chip, Zilenko, or you're a dead man! Wait! -Who are you? -Do you understand? What did you say? One moment. If I don't get a risk bonus, I'm out of here. If you move a muscle, they'll kill us. Just translate! -Shut up! -No problem! Give me the chip! You have ten seconds! What did he say? He says he wants the chip. What? Give it to them. Tell them I prefer to die for my country than give in! I don't give a damn about France, I want to stay alive. -Translate, this is an order! -Okay. We'll give you the chip, but put down your weapons. -What's up with you? -I'm having an asthma attack! Look! He's armed! No sound or images, this isn't right! It isn't moving. The transaction must be finished. Find the fault, I'm going to find our two birds. Moindrau? Moindrau? Are you panting? Moindrau? Is it you who's panting or not? Moindrau! I saved the chip, Moindrau. I saved the chip! Sorry. What are you doing, Moindrau? Come on! I'll stay and wait for the police. You'll explain what you were doing with an international trafficker. And the Taiwanese… He wants the chip! Give him the chip or he'll kill us! I never go back on a deal. Never. In fact, this is what I do with it. Breathe. You've lost your touch, Conche. You didn't used to be so nervous. -What? -He knows you well. He says you're a wuss. I'm not sure that you're an expert in Georgian slang. Wait, Moindrau! U-turn. Bye, Mr. de la Conche, hello, my 20 million dollars! Come. Don't take it personally. Don't worry, they already got me. It's swelling! I'm sure it's infected. What have you put into my arm? A little chip. Stop complaining. Wait, maybe I'm having an allergic reaction and I shouldn't be complaining? Speak quieter! We're escaping. Escaping? Quieter? As long as you tell me what we were doing in that suite. I know the exact steps to follow. So just do as your boss says. -My boss? Ah, great! -Yes. I didn't know! What do we do now, boss? -Huh? -I said: What do we do? Wait for me here, I'll be back. What the hell! Ah, Punam! You're on your way? I think it's better if we meet up… Do you want us to be seen? Step number one: No non-secure communications! No more mobile phones. My phone! It's old, we'll get you one that's ten times better. He's completely mental! What are you doing? I'm calling my management, it's procedure. Who the hell are you kidding? We said no more mobile phones! Are you playing dumb? It's ringing! I'm connecting the outside camera. That's not good. That sounds really bad. There are uniforms everywhere. Spooks, as the French say. The serial killer's identity has been revealed by Scotland Yard. His name is Jean-Pierre Moindrau, interpreter and a French citizen, who the English have named "The Donovan Butcher." Tell me the truth or I'll call the police. At least I'll be treated. The less you know, the safer you are. Great. This is where our paths divide. Give me my bag. I have a date with my fiancée. -Moindrau. -What? You're on TV! Oh, shit… Christ almighty! -Where did they get the photos? -Scotland Yard is looking for you. But I'm innocent! Stop! -Twelve deaths. -Jean-Pierre! -Punam. -What are you doing? I've been going round in circles for ages to find you! -Who's this lovely lady? -I told you, she's my fiancée. It's our lucky day. Hurry! Er… What are you doing? Listen… Moindrau! -Let's go to your friend's house. -Okay! You look gorgeous, darling, I've missed you! Me too, Jean-Pierre. You've got 25 million dollars in your arm! Let's go, Moindrau, let's go! Get a move on! Hurry up! -Hurry up! -Yes! You're either irresponsible or a real idiot! Stay seated, Colonel. Colonel, I suppose that you can't say anything more… significant about why you were at The Crown Donovan? Alas, Superintendent, you know that I have a diplomat status, and with that title, I benefit from full immunity. Say, she's a lot younger than you, right? What do I care? I didn't want to butt in on your privacy. There's no risk to my privacy in that respect. My dad, my mum and my brother. Welcome. It's a pleasure. My grandma, my little sister, my little brother, my uncle, my cousin and my other uncle. Nama… namasté. A lovely… lovely family. -Yes. I don't feel… -Jean-Pierre! -He's tired. -Oh, jet lag. Stress, you know. It's better if he lies down. Oh dear. I need to lie down. -Lie down. -I need to lie down. -Miss Pou… Poupoupou… -Punam. Punam, that's it, please forgive me for disturbing your family gathering. -No problem, we love having people. -It's very kind of you. I didn't want to abuse your hospitality but could I make a call as… we were rushed, unfortunately I couldn't sort things out… Thank you. Thanks a lot. Thank you, thanks a lot. You're free, Colonel. -Thank you. -We'll keep your weapon. As evidence. An embassy car awaits you. Colonel Berthaud? There's a reverse call for you, Colonel. In the name of François, then "de", then "la", then "Conche." An urgent call, my father is sick. -His father… -Yes, dad? How are you? My dear father. No, It's François de la Conche on the line. Dad, do you have your medicine? I'm telling you I'm not your… Oh, right. Okay, I get it. It's your dad on the line. I have the medicine but it's no longer in its tube, it's in the interpreter's arm. It was an accident. -I know everything. -Already? Have you seen the papers and the TV? Scotland Yard has interrogated me, thanks to your escapades! Are you in London, Colonel? Ah, okay, I get it, you were the tactical support. Of course. Who, the archbishop of Canterbury? The archbishop of Canterbury too? No, yes, of course. I thought… but it's an image. Don't worry, I understand the procedures perfectly. Meeting at the French embassy? Scotland Yard will be waiting for you there. Sure, of course, you're right. Tomorrow I'll catch the Eurostar with the other idiot. Impossible, you've set off the Exterminator process. The chip becomes a bomb once implanted in a body. Really? He won't feel pain for 12 hours. -Really? -And then, boom. What you're saying is terrifying! The poor bloke! -Why did nobody tell me? -We did, you don't listen. Oh, Punam… If you knew how much I wanted you. -What's he doing here? -He's my older brother. If he knew that we… before marriage… he'd slit your throat. Punam, I can't say everything, your life would be in danger. but you need to help me. Danger? But why? Imagine I've got a… Listen, change of plan. -You're going to meet me here. -Negative. You're under strict surveillance for 24 hours. -Damn. I mean, it's a bit… -You must act alone. -Oh right, but why? -Because you're the best, is that clear? Er… -Affirmative, Colonel. -Good. Remember that as soon as you get the chip. You'll have the rest of the steps. Take care, dad, and be careful with the medicine. -I love you, dad! -I love you too. I mean, my regards, Colonel. My regards. Jean-Pierre told his friend he would taste the best Indian food in the whole of London. It's kind of you but… we can't stay, Mr. Moindrau, we must… Careful, refusing an Indian invitation is a diplomatic affair! -Did I misunderstand something? -Yes! The entire family works at the Indian embassy, here in London. So when he says "a diplomatic affair"… -Do you understand? -Yes, I understood that, thanks. Dinner is served! -Mr. de la Conche. -Thank you. Jean-Pierre. -Me. -Yes, that's good, thank you. -What are they? -Chillies. Oh yes, of course. Careful, they're very, very strong. Gracias. Er… I… Thank you. I feel nothing. Loving chilli is a sign of masculinity in our country. What did she say? Eating chillies in India is a sign of masculinity. That's interesting, can I try? You prefer it if I don't? She says yes. Indians shake their heads when they mean yes. -And vice versa. -That's surprising. So when I do this, it means "yes"? No, not that. Yes? Oh yes? Okay, that's it, I understand. If I finish the bowl, do I win anything? Do you like it? Punam, do you work at the embassy? I'm an interpreter like Jean-Pierre, I'm part of the… Mr. la Conche! It's the Indian chilli, you need to get used to it. You see, I'm used to it and I don't feel anything. That's normal, it's thanks to the chip! -I don't see the relationship. -I'll explain it to you. Put your hand here. Ouch! Are you crazy? -Did you feel something? -Of course! I don't know. Try it yourself. Ouch! But not on me! On yourself! I wanted to do a test first. A test… Ouch! No, it's true, I don't feel anything. Okay, don't butcher yourself. This chip is a nanotechnology monster, it blocks a soldier's pain, do you understand? Very well. So if I want to punch you in the face and you take a hammer to defend yourself, I won't feel anything. I don't recommend it. As unfortunately, I've just been told that in precisely ten hours and 21 minutes, this chip will go "boom." Without me, you're dead. What do you mean, "boom"? We'll be fine, don't worry. See? I told you! He's the Donovan butcher. He's going to kill us! Filthy traitor. -Dirty pig! -You dog! I'm going to slit your throat and spread your blood! -What did he say? -Basically, he's going to kill us. There's a mistake, I didn't kill anyone. Punam, please believe me. He's telling the truth. M. Conche works for the French government. And Moindrau was accompanying him on a mission which turned into a drama. He had nothing to do with it, you have my word. And a Conche's word counts. He has nothing to do with the massacre. He gives us his word. -That's it. -That's it. What do you think? Get out of my house! Or I'll rip out your guts and make wreaths with them! -Sorry for the misunderstanding. -Bastard! Thank you for your welcome. Thank you again. -I'm going to look ridiculous, darling! -Trust me. What the hell are you doing? Let's go! Here, have my phone. -No. -Shut up. Come on! -Come on! -Yes, Conche! -Be careful, baby! -Yes, be careful. -What's that ridiculous clothing? -Eccentric. -Here, everyone is eccentric. -Really? -What do we do now? -Go to the hospital. Let's get a taxi. -Your in-laws are special. -Especially the dad. What a shame. Taxi! Taxi! Can you open the door for me? Er… London Hospital. Major Bashir? It didn't quite work out the way you wanted at The Donovan. Am I wrong? Do we still agree on 20 million? -Absolutely. -Just a little hitch. Tomorrow, same place, same time, and the chip is yours. A little clarification, supplier. In the event you were double-crossed by The Donovan Butcher, I'll probably have to deal directly with him. The situation is under control, Your Excellency. See you tomorrow. Conche, we've been driving all night! All the hospitals are under surveillance. I don't want you to explode in the taxi either. -Are you crazy? -Did I hurt you? -No. -This chip is incredible. One second, please. Put your hand in again to see. -Like this? -A little higher. Don't move. You're sick! Come on! It's for science! -Hey, hey! Taxi! -What are you doing? -We're changing taxi. -No, we've changed 20 times. -Anti-tailing technique. -I don't care about your techniques. I'll explode because of you and you will too, for France! Long live France! You aren't going to die, Moindrau! I swear! I always brought my teammates back. There's another solution. Let me go. Let me go, Moindrau. STANFORD MORGUE - LONDON Don't move, don't say anything until I give you the all clear. -Two knocks to say yes. -How many for no? Are you doing this on purpose? You can't imagine what I've seen. Take intermittent breaths. No, don't breathe now. Ah. Tree. And in his… And in his… How do you say "arm"? Impossible, he's in the vapes, at worst. My dead is not dead. Don't try to make the malin with me. No, no, careful! Moindrau, what the hell are you doing? What are you doing? And you? Moindrau, the clock. That's it, Moindrau. We're safe. The chip is in the syringe. Ouch! What's he doing? A couple of stitches. Ouch, it hurts! Normal, you no longer have the chip. You've been very brave. I'm proud of you. Thank you. You're a real wimp! You need to man up. You'll never be a hero. No. General Directorate for External Security. De la Conche for Colonel Berthaud. Don't hang up, I'm passing the call. Do you have the chip? Yes, I have it. What are the instructions? I'm stuck at the embassy. We move to the retreat phase. Hide. Do you have network contacts? Network contacts? Obviously I have network contacts! I really feel like you're taking me for a novice, Colonel. -It's irritating! -You're one of the best. -Go and hide, and then call me. -Affirmative. Sorry for my behaviour. Here on the ground, we're on edge, the situation is difficult and I'm not being helped at all. All right. -So? -Nothing. We get out of here. It'd be nice if you could stop acting like a clown. It'll stop us from getting noticed. -Admiral Mandelieu? -Affirmative. Berthaud on the line. I can prove that Conche has overtaken us, allow me to retrieve the chip, whatever the price is for that traitor. I want the chip. I don't care about that little diplomat's life. I understand you, Admiral. I know someone here who can help us. You have contacts with otters? -With who? -Nothing. -Where are we going? -To see the manager. She's crazy for me. She can't turn me away. -Crazy for you? Are you sure? -Shut up, idiot. Gwendy? François? Gwendoline, you haven't changed, you're just as beautiful! Lady McFarlane… Niels, let me introduce you to François de la Conche, an old friend. Not so old! -Pleased to meet you, Sir. -Hello. I'll see you in a bit. -Who's he? -Huh? -Who's he? -Niels? He's my assistant. -Ah, your assistant? -Yes. He's quite young to be your assistant. -Right? -Young and dazzling. One of the greatest specialists of tropical plants in England. Ah right? You'd never know by looking at him! He's very dull. He's the kind of rich kid I can't stand. Why don't you admit that he makes you turn green with envy? Me? Look Gwendy, are you joking? For that dorky-looking guy? Look, we aren't even playing in the same league. -Reassure me. -Sorry, I've got work to do. Wait, Gwen… Help me. Scotland Yard is on my tail. Scotland Yard? I guess you've heard about The Donovan Butcher? -Obviously! -He's here with me. I find it exciting. Gwen, please! Am I not disturbing you? Gwen, this is Jean-Pierre Moindrau. The Donovan Butcher. Harmless, but… it's him. Mr. Moindrau, Miss Gwendoline McFarlane. Pleased to meet you, madam. Miss. I insist. -My heart is still to be won. -I don't believe you. A woman as beautiful as you must be surrounded by a crowd of wooers, followers, people who want to marry you. As long as you're not too picky. -I wish. -Thanks for the compliment. I live with wild beasts, I have the same instinct. A relationship between two beings is above all… bestial. -Right? -We didn't come to talk about animals. Have you got anything to eat? We haven't eaten since this morning. I think I've still got some porridge and jelly. Wonderful, you'll like it. Keep your chair, I'll bring it back. You know you drive me crazy. If only you wanted to! But yes, no, so am I, I'm an animal. I'm a wild animal! -Stop. -Yes, Gwen! -Yes! Gwen… -No! I'll be back. That Moindrau… What the hell! The Embassy Cultural Attaché, but why? -Where did you get that phone from? -Shh. You have something that interests me, Mr. Moindrau. Shut up. Or should I call you "The Donovan Butcher"? Me? I don't understand. I know you have the chip. -What's he saying? -He knows about the chip. No! No way, tell him that we haven't got it! Okay. You're right. I've got the chip. You speak our language? So listen to me. I have 20 million dollars in my secure, Maureen and Bruce Bank account. Give me the Exterminator, you get 20 million dollars. What do you think? He's furious. He thinks we're lying. He's taken Punam hostage. Hostage? That's annoying, yeah. You can't make an omelette without breaking eggs. There's always collateral damage in missions. You're talking about Punam. You're talking about the woman I love. -I know. -You know what I'm going to do? Tell him we're at the zoo. There'll be some big, but really big collateral damage. Don't do it! You don't negotiate with a kidnapper. It's obvious! If you want to see your fiancée again, tell him we haven't got the chip, that it's a big misunderstanding. And then be firm, very firm. Go on. I want… I want 25 million dollars. You're really tough. That's a highly significant amount. I'll call you back in one hour. You were perfect. What did he say? He knows we have the chip. He'll kill Punam in one hour! Do whatever you want, I'm going to save her. -You aren't going anywhere. -Do you think you can stop me? -We'll give him the chip. -You're being reasonable. -Your phone, so I can call my wife. -Here. LA CONCHERIE THALASSO - OPENING SOON -The yellow product. -The what? The yellow product that you use for the hydrangea beds. -A question of life or death. -Benzoic tetrachloride? -What? -It's a fertiliser. Great. Marie-Hélène! -Isn't this lovely? -Wonderful. What's that noise I can hear? The works have started. Remember, the thalasso centre! -What? -We'll finally make money on the house. Don't you dare do that to my ancestors! -Yes! -It's my castle! Yes, but it's my money. When I'm back, Marie-Hélène, we'll talk about this properly. Perfect! Hello? -François? -Huh? Ah! You scared me, Gwendoline. -What are you making? -Me? I don't know, I was thinking about us, all the hours we spent in this greenhouse, rolling around among cuttings and seedlings. -No. You've chosen. -Yes, Gwen, the beast is back. -All of that is over. -Gwendoline? -Can I talk to you? -Yes, I'm listening. One-to-one? One-to-one. Wait a minute, he's spying on us, it can't be true. -He's jealous, it's normal. -Jealous? Why? Sorry, it's really urgent! Wait for me here, we need to talk. Right, Gwendy? Yes. Moindrau! Moindrau! The phone! Leave it, it's the Cultural Attaché. Above all, say that we have what he wants and he mustn't touch the hostage. Hello? Have you thought about my offer? 25 million dollars is fine. Er, I've told him we have the chip. He's about to spare Punam. Good, good, good. Great! So tell him we'll do the exchange at the City Hall Square under the London Bridge. -Go on. -And not here? Sorry? Who's the professional? Yeah, okay. Tell him! Don't get angry! The place of exchange will be the City Hall Square. A public place. I see I'm dealing with a true professional. In one hour. Watch out for the blue car! The blue car, watch out! Gwen! Right! Right! No, Niels, everything's ok. I'm taking François to the town hall, don't worry. Why does he call you every ten minutes? The baby, the baby! Stupid idiot! Here we are. I don't get why that Niels calls you all day long. -All the time, it's strange! -We're here. Yes, we're here. You're coming, right? I'll stay behind you, Moindrau. Don't forget, cool-headed and professional. I'll cover for you, you're safe. You're on time. It's a quality that I like. What's my fiancée doing here? Let's say she's my personal guarantee. You know who you're dealing with, Major. The transaction will take place once Punam is free. You're demanding, Mr. Moindrau. Too demanding. I don't have much patience. He's the key to the safe. In return, the chip. Mr. la Conche! Didn't you catch it? Wait, Major. -No need to hide. -What are you doing? If you want Gwendy, over my dead body. Great… Here! Rotten roast beef! Here! I'm a pro, Major. I didn't come without tactical support. Tactical support? You just have to… There you go! Let go of my leg, bastard! Bastard! -I'm sure you're bluffing. -No! Move a muscle and you'll be with your ancestors in the Ganges. One look and I'll start a carnage worse than at The Donovan. The guy with the guitar over there, nine millimetres of explosive bullets. The street cleaner, hand grenade in his bucket. Alright? So… not one movement that could be misunderstood. -Jean-Pierre! -Quick, get in the car! Let's go, Conche! Yes. Sorry, mate, you asked for it. Well, thanks for the tactical support. I had a hitch because of this jealous guy. He doesn't get that Gwen and I are soulmates. Your Niels turned up mid-transaction, almost ruining everything. Without me… I knew it! He kicked your teeth in, obviously. Obviously not, Gwen! It was me who taught him a lesson, fair and square. Did you do that? What happened with Major Bashir? What did you say? She says that she was very worried about me and thought I was very professional. -Ah, she's kind. -That's not what I heard. What did you hear, darling? I lived in Delhi for eight years. I speak Hindi fluently. Mr. Moindrau says he made you believe that the lady and her entire family had been taken hostage. Wow! Is that true, Moindrau? To get the chip. With your crappy principles, I would never have gotten it. I never gave it to you. -What? -I put fertiliser in the vial. You let me go to that meeting and risk my life without the chip? It's a profession, it isn't for amateurs. Very good. I know how to get rid of offsets. Go to the Maureen and Bruce Bank. Do you know where it is? Yes, I know it, not only the address, but also Lord Conrad Bruce, the director. -Who's that guy? -The man has ten girls at home. The grey car! It's improvisation, it's against the rules of the job. I don't care about your rules! My method is wild and free. Okay then, wild and free, well… Yes, er… Are you Lord Conrad? Oh! Do you speak French? Very well. I write it just as well. Très impressionant. Have you heard about The Donovan Butcher? Ah! Horrible, horrible, what a massacre! What world do we live in, Lord Mayfair? How do humans come to commit such violence? I wouldn't like to be in the mind of such a man it must be complete chaos! With an animal-like IQ. That's what I think. I'm The Donovan Butcher. Of course! You are, I am, we're all Donovan Butchers in power. No reason to act on it! Would you like some tea? You didn't answer. Are you doing this on purpose? It's me! I'm the butcher! It's me in this picture! -You're the butcher? -Yes. Hey! Don't move. What's the number of Mr. Bashir's safe? -Mr. Bashir? -Hurry up. -I can't remember the numbers. -Careful! I have the IQ of an animal. I can be extremely violent. -Yes. -You have a wife. And you have nine daughters, right? Do you care about them? -You haven't… -Not yet. But I have them. -You have them? -Yes. Go! Shut up, slut, or I'll kill you! Scream, no one will hear you. Enough. -You're sick. -I know. If I open the safe, promise me… you'll spare their lives. Of course, I can't refuse. Thank you. Did he do it? That's amazing. Look… Get a move on, Moindrau! We need to go! It's long, right. No, Moindrau, now, we have to go! Sorry, darling, but we need to go! -Yes, we need to go… -We need to go! A SIG Sauer, just as you requested. Thank you. Conche had planned his stunt from the start. And the ninjas? He must have promised them the chip, tricking them, and let them find out at the place of exchange. And the interpreter? Sorry. It's my wife! If you could… Five minutes, thank you. -Hello, darling? -Darling? No, I'm not your darling. François de la Conche. I'm alone, you can speak normally. -There's something fishy. -Absolutely. -The messages from Paris. -Thank you. I started the recording in the room, we'll know soon enough. -At London Zoo? -Don't you like animals? -It's on the other side of the city. -It's a quiet place. Okay, I'll be there in half an hour. So, what do you say? This isn't our money. We'll end up in prison. Who's going to want it back? A shady Cultural Attaché who wanted a chip stolen by Zilenko? There are 25 million dollars in that bag! Can you imagine what we could do? It could change our lives, we could do whatever we wanted! -It's dirty money. -Not at all, it's very clean! -The notes are new! -Not literally. I've got something to drink. -Whisky. -Whisky! I propose a deal. You feel hesitant, I understand, it's normal. I'm offering you a small share, just enough to pay your expenses, and I'll keep the rest because, you know, I'm a scumbag. Okay, we'll do it like that. Show me the notes. You're coming, huh? -Ah, the pig! -What pig? Have you got a lighter? Er… no. Here! The pig! You're mental! Look at the flame! -What about it? -What colour is it? -There's no real colour. -Rightly so! The ink of real notes gives off a highly recognisable blue halo. Do you see a blue halo? They're fake notes. No, Conche, are you serious? -So much that you can have them. -Chin chin! The possession of fake money can get you life in prison. Very smart. Conche, you're a diplomat, don't you know a way, a way to get rid of them? I'll leave them to you, I won't touch a single note. -Wait, I don't want them either! -What shall we do? Do you know a way to make them disappear? Yes, there is the incinerator which is used for weeds. They'll be burnt in the morning. That's what we have to do. We can't keep them. Do you agree, Moindrau? I need to go to my meeting. I could have been a millionaire for half an hour. Yes, Moindrau. Darling? No, I'm not. -François de la Conche. -I'm alone, speak normally. -I'm at London Zoo. -I'll be there in half an hour. There's no doubt that the traitor is Colonel Berthaud. I hope you know how serious these accusations are. The evidence is formal. It's undeniable, Ambassador. We must warn Scotland Yard. They're in charge of the investigation. Colonel. Come, I've found a more discreet place. Isn't it discreet here? A better place, Colonel. Just to be careful. We'll be more relaxed. Well done, de la Conche. Great work. Thank you, Colonel. The President will pay tribute to you for serving the country. -It's an honour. -Posthumously. What? "He was a fussy diplomat who served France." "His death reminds us that every day, men in the shadows risk their lives." What's the matter with you? You've gone crazy! Put down your weapon, Colonel Berthaud! You're surrounded! Did you tell Scotland Yard? I swear I didn't! An aristocrat's word! You degenerate lowlife, I'll… Ouch! Present… arms! Jean-Éric Berthaud. François de la Conche. Two names that France will never forget. These two heroes served the country with bravery and selflessness… -Are you okay? -No. …will live on in our thoughts. No, it's the tie, I can't stand it! I'm going to take it off, I can't breathe. Jean-Éric Berthaud. François de la Conche. On behalf of the French President, by virtue of the powers bestowed upon us, we make you knights of the Legion of Honour, posthumously. It's quite practical, two dead heroes. It means we can bury the matter. Present… arms! Fire! PUNAM'S PLACE -Bye, thank you. -Bye, see you soon! OPEN What about the bags with the money? Right, in this moment, the story becomes even more unbelievable. I open the bags in the greenhouse and before me, 25 million dollars. In little notes. But then, something smelled fishy. I had a doubt. I'll explain it. -Does anyone have a dollar? -Me. Do you know the colour of the flame when you burn a dollar? I knew it. -No. -Blue. Blue, that's it. You'll see, it's surprising. It's surprising. A blue… Yes. The flame isn't blue. What… the flame isn't blue? -No. -Impossible. He can't have done that to me! He can't have. He can't have done that to me. LAND DEEDS Is that it, Lord MacAnnan? It's a pleasure doing business with you, Mr. de la Conche. The MacAnnan manor is yours. -It's done, darling. -Yes, perfect. It's perfect. It's ours now. Amazing. I can finally be your explorer. Colonel Berthaud, what happened to him? I think he'll be in hiding for a long time. Subtitle translation by: Katie Wright
