This is the town of Vayalathaadi in Vellaramkunnu. It's the love child of greenery and nature. That's what our ancestors said. People here believe that this land is a fertile ground for love. This is where Ashokan's story began. This is a town which has love in its air. She was as beautiful as Vellaramkunnu itself. She was the one every man in the town dreamt of. She shined as brightly as the sun. And was as soft as moonlight. And that moonlight was called... Unnimaya. Unfortunately for everyone in town, this is where Unnimaya's story ends. The hero of our next story is, of course, Ashokan. It's a story of a marriage that sounds like a fairy tale. I think I should grease it. I mean... the door. Ashokan... there's something I need to ask you. It's-- I want you to tell me the truth. Please don't lie to me. I wanted to ask this before we got married. Is this your second marriage? Do you have two children? Here's your tea. Is he still in bed? You want to get him married, so that he stops acting like a kid, right? Waking up late is a good sign. It means that he's not a kid anymore. -Do you get it? -Hey! You should be ashamed of yourself, old man. Enough! Sweet! Did you mean the tea or... My girl... My girl... My eyes are wide open My heart beats often Yes, she is here I'm looking at her -She is superb! -Ashokan is really lucky! Perfume! My girl... My girl... My eyes are wide open My heart beats often Yes, she is here I'm looking at her My girl... My girl... My eyes are wide open My heart beats often Yes, she is here I'm looking at her My girl has the eyes of a babbler birdie My girl is charming Like a princess in a story My girl has the eyes of a babbler birdie My girl is charming Like a princess in a story My girl... My girl... My eyes are wide open My heart beats often Yes, she is here I'm looking at her My girl is like the springtime mizzle In her deep eyes, the kohl fizzles Like waves... The praises you can hear Are nothing but the names of my dear Like stories... My girl has the eyes of a babbler birdie My girl is charming Like a princess in a story When my girl smiles... The whole universe... In darkness, lights up My soul in happiness leaps up My girl has the eyes of a babbler birdie My girl is charming Like a princess in a story My girl... My girl... My eyes are wide open My heart beats often Yes, she is here I'm looking at her Ashokan! -Ashokan! -My girl! What? I knew it! I saw you staring at her yesterday! I knew there was something fishy. "My girl!" Alright, so where were you today? The first date or the first night? Tell me! I know one thing for sure. I'll have twins. -Really? -Yeah! I dream of twin babies these days. Really? Dreams that one has at dawn come true, right? -I don't know. -Yeah! Why did you miss the game today? I didn't feel like it. Don't you have to go to work? -Work? -Yeah! -Get out of my way! -Ashokan! Shit! I'm late! He's really dedicated! He's going to work without a shirt. Ashokan, you forgot your shirt. Ashokan! Sir? Yeah. -Manoharan? -I got married. She's my wife. -How are you doing? -I'm good. Sweets. I thought Manoharan has forgotten his office and his colleagues -after marriage. -No, Sir! I'm planning to resume work in two days. Hey! Don't worry about it. -I knew it. -Take your time. This is the perfect time to take some time off! Visit your relatives, go on a trip, have fun! You are useless anyway. No... I mean... the quality of work we have isn't good enough for him. I am telling you the truth! I haven't had a subordinate as dashing and intelligent as him in my entire career! And I've been here for years! I keep telling him to take the IAS test. Right? IAS? IA... S! Yes! IAS! IAS! Yes, you do. He is really lazy, but he's really smart as well. I would say you are really lucky to be married to someone like him. Anyway, wish you a happy married life! Please... Thanks. -Sir. -No, that's okay. May I? -Here he is! -Pushpa! Sweets! -My wife. -Alright, bye. -You're really popular here. -Of course, I am Hey! Ashokan! Are you leaving? Yes, we are having dinner at her uncle's place. Goodbye. Come on, dear! Have you put on some weight? Hold me tight. -I'll tell you the reason later. -What are you doing? Ashokan, when are you going to give us these sweets? I'll give you not one but two sweets! She wants me to get married for her sweets! -Narayanan, take this. -Yes? Okay. She is from Masinagudi. Masinagudi? Yeah. Come on! I had a younger sister. You know her. She had eloped with the postman Padmanabhan. Unnimaya! Yes, Unnimaya. Anyway. I can't blame Padmanabhan either. She was really beautiful. Of course! Back then, every young man in the village wanted to be with her. My father used to beat them to pulp. My father would use his trademark hiccup punch to hit them! They will hiccup for the rest of their lives. Then? Then what? She lives in Masinagudi now. Her elder son got married last year. I went there to give him my blessings and she gave me a gift. -This is that gift. -That's good. You got a banana corm? Is that a nendran? No, it's a special one from Masinagudi. -Masinagudi? -Yeah. Chathan Nair gave it to me. His sister lives there. -Unnimaya, the girl who ran away! -Who? Unnimaya! Unnimaya? Unnimaya! Unnimaya! Ashokan, the kids are swimming out there! Why the hell are you using a bucket? Swimming is not a tough job, dude. First put your left hand forward and then right. -Then left, then right. -That's all. -And repeat it. -Can I use my right hand first? Yes, but you need to get into the water. -You can't swim up there. -That's true. You didn't mind coming in earlier, right? What happened? That's because he knew Arjun would save him, right? How is Arjun? I had hoped to see him at Ajayan's wedding. He hasn't called me for a while. So, I'm the only one who has met him recently. When was that? When I went to Mumbai to crack a deal for Mehta's apartment. -I forgot to tell you guys. -Well, say it now. What can I say? He looks great. Meeting him was really useful. -I got back to Kochi for free. -How? -Do you know the Navy's warship Vikrant? -Yes, Vikrant! They brought it down to Kochi for repair. It was in the news. Arjun is with the Navy. You know what? He got me a free ride! God! -But that wasn't the best part. -Idiot! The captain was a Sikh. Mr. Singh. Was it Yuvraj Singh? No, Harbhajan Singh. -Stop making fun of him! -I'll run away! -He's bluffing. -He was really cool! Whenever he felt sleepy, he gave me the ship's control! Really? I'm telling you the truth! I steered the ship more than half the way. It's really simple! -Shyju, you're... -Yes. -a big fat liar! -Hey! Go! You should be at school! What are you doing out here? -Hey, calm down! -The kids know it as well. "Color your wedding dreams with Vanaja Jewelry." -Didn't you take your bike, Ashokan? -No. Pazhampori is sitting under the banyan tree with a coconut sapling. -Coconut sapling? -Yeah. Hey! -What? -Where is this from? -Come. -Bye! Shall we? Where's teacher? She's taking a day off. -Really? -Yeah. -Excuse me? -Yeah? Can you stop by later? Grandmother is not well. Sure. Here. Medicines are really expensive these days. Thanks for coming, Ratheesh. That's alright. We tried calling many drivers but no one came. They're all idiots! If you have any emergency just call me. But we can't blame them either. They may have come to know it's a viral fever. What fever? Viral fever. There is... nothing called... viral fever. If there was, everyone would have it, right? Anyway, I need to go. Hey! -I need to go. See you later. -Okay. Take care, Grandma. I hope he is waiting. What happened? All I have is four cents of land. My forefathers didn't plant a single coconut palm. So, I make do with these. Let's go. Why didn't you tell me about it? Because... I didn't want to hurt you. Then? Then... one evening... Ratheesh, please wait. Wait? -What? -Take this. It's a red-king coconut sapling. You will get a good yield in a few years. I don't get it. Our children shouldn't complain about their forefathers. I don't want my children to pick coconuts from the roadside. God! You have... really... thought it through. -Here! -What? What next? Well... we'll see! It's her! Hello. Yeah! No, I'm here. They look swollen. What happened, Father? Hey! It's just some knee pain. It's okay. I feel better now. When you have someone to care of you... knee pain is a good thing. Right, Father? What did he mean? -You didn't get it? -No. Only a loving father can understand... how his son's mind works! What? He didn't like the ointment. What's wrong with it? God! Like father, like son. This one is good. -Is it a poovan? -No, she is from Masinagudi. You can take two corms if you want. Great! Come on! Finish your tea! Just a minute! They need a corm. Come. From Masinagudi? You're looking for a match for your son, right? He can do it on his own. What about your daughter? She has finished her education. She works at the village bank. We are getting many proposals but nothing is working out. Where is she? -Sweetheart! -Yeah? What are you thinking? We could get these two married. That's up to him. What do you say, Ashokan? She wouldnâ€™t have a problem. She won't find a more humble and good-natured boy. Not to mention your lineage. He has a government job as well. No girl here is as modest and as well-behaved as your daughter. Besides she works in a bank. Send us your son's horoscope. Sure. We'll take your leave. -Alright. -Okay. Bye. -We'll meet again soon. -Okay. -Ashokan, pull over. -You want to see kids playing? -Just pull over. -What's wrong? -What's it, Father? -I left the corms back there. -Well done. -What do we do now? We go back. He is short, brown and unattractive. And he's a clerk in the village office. I don't like him! Please don't force me. Looks don't really matter! Really? Why did you marry a tall and handsome man like him? Ashokan is a good guy. Please don't force me. I don't like him. Tell her to stop shouting. We'll tell them that their horoscopes don't match. -What more can I do? -How many times should I say it? Ashokan... What's wrong? What happened? Did they say something? We'll find you a better girl! Narayanan's daughter is not exactly a princess! She works at a bank. That's the only good quality she has. That's not a big deal. We were just going with the flow. I'll introduce you to Mr. Balan's daughter. She's pretty and she's a lawyer as well. I'll do it soon. Come on! Shit! I won't be able to ride it. Come here. Let's go. Okay. -You're coming, right? -Yeah. She was right. But she shouldn't have rejected you. Ashokan... you should learn to deal with setbacks in life. You'll soar like Philips! Do you want to fly? Tell me! Soar like... Philips. It's not Philips, it's Panasonic. What? Your knowledge has improved after you started driving. But you should work more. Bye, Mother! Hey! Phoenix. What? The bird is called "phoenix." Oh, come on. You got my point, right? -Shyju, just a minute. -Yes, Mother? I want you guys to come home for lunch tomorrow. What's the occasion? I have invited Ajayan and his bride as well. -Perfect! -Bloody hell! All the best! Yeah! Let's go! We'll be back for lunch with Ajayan! -No. -Come on. AJAYAN WEDS KUNJU Aunt? Ajayan, come in. Oh, God! Hey, Ashokan. How are you doing? Have you met all our relatives? No, I haven't. You need to get a life, man! Shut up. Would you like some rice? No, thanks, I'm done. We're having a feast every day. You must be on leave, right? They gave me two weeks. I managed to make it two months. That's good! This is the perfect time to take a break! -Hey, Achu! -I'm coming. I'll be back soon. Mother, give me some stir-fry. He loves stir-fired banana stalk. He can finish a bucketful of rice with this stir-fry. Ajayan, have you guys been on your honeymoon? Of course. We went to Kullu-Manali for our honeymoon. -Right? -Really? Kullu-Manali? It's a great place. Shyju, have you ever been to Kullu-Manali? No, but Kullu-Manali is a great place. I've been told. Hey, Ajayan. What is the price of land in Kullu-Manali? Shyju, we didn't go to Kullu-Manali for a land deal. God! Hey! Are you alright? -Have some water. -Awful! Are you okay? Carry on. What the hell... Ashokan... don't you like these drumsticks? This dessert is really tasty, right? Aunt makes the best desserts. We used to come here every year for a vacation. And then we had a blast! I used to win every game we played! Like... Kuttipanthu. I won at singing as well! -Can you sing? -Of course! You haven't heard anything yet. Mother, I'm leaving! Please tell Father. Okay. Who is this? That's Arjun, Aunt Ranjini's son. -Was he at our wedding? -No. He is an officer with the Indian Navy. Apparently, he didn't get a leave. Here. Have some more. It's so good. What? What's up? Are you snooping around? Hey! He is my age. Ashokan, you need to grow up. Your parents should feel that you are ready for marriage. That's because I'm their only son. That's not your fault. Ratheesh, what's happening? I hope you're staying here for a few days. No way! I'll leave by evening. I have a lot to do back home! When will we meet again? Hopefully... -at Ashokan's wedding. -What? -I hope I live to see it! -What? -Idiot! -God! Go! He is your aunt's son. -I knew the right answer. -You're a smart boy. -Father! -Achu? Father? -Where are you going? -I'm going to meet Grandma! Will you buy me a sweet? Father? Hey, son! Do you want a chocolate? Yes. Which one do you like? -Munch! -Munch it is. Let me get it. Hey, I'm taking this. Here you go. Give me a kiss. I don't care how he behaves with me. But... what about this little boy? Let's go, son. Ashokan! Ashokan! Ashokan! -Oh, God! -Ashokan? Ashokan, wait. Why are you running away from me? Do you want to humiliate me in front of everybody? I hurt you really bad, right? Hurt! I want you to know why I rejected you. It's not that I don't like you or you're not good enough. I'm in love with someone else. Well, he is a lucky guy. What makes you think you're not? When I was in school, I was one of those boys... who used to laugh at those who had girlfriends. You know why? Because I never had one myself. Many girls might have been in love with you. That's rubbish. Have you ever confessed your love for anyone? No. Why not? I was scared. Don't you think the girl would be scared as well? Really? There's a girl out there for you. You'll meet her when the time's right. But one thing is certain, the girl you marry will be lucky to have you. -Really? -Of course. -Shyama? -Yeah. -Shyama? -What is it? Go and get the milk. Why don't you tell him? He's playing out there. -Nonsense! -Go on! It's awful! I don't know what to do with him. -I told you to be home on time, right? -Sorry, Father! -Please don't, Father. -You little scamp! -I'll never go again. -He has no time to study. Go now! Over here! Goal! Sister? What are you doing? Nothing. Something's not right. -What do you want? -Father wants to see you. Go, I'll come. -Go away. -Alright! Mother? -Mother? -Yeah. Where are those old newspapers? I sold them off to some scrap dealers. What? History, right? We consider history a tough subject to crack. But history is the true essence of life! Hey! What? Come home with me this evening. Why? It's my grandmother's birthday. No, my father will rip me apart if I'm late. We'll be making the vermicelli dessert. -Vermicelli dessert? -Yes. I'll definitely be there. What about your father? Grandma! Happy birthday to you! -What are you doing? -What did I do? Granny is diabetic. I can't get her chilly fritters on her birthday, right? Go upstairs and keep your bag in my room. Here you go. Idiot! Shyama? Idiot! Ashokan! On the night of a moonlit shower Someone... In the heart of a lily flower Came one... Someone... Neither the rain cloud Nor the bright star Neither the snow nor the breeze Saw it coming unknown But come it did alone An illusion... Of desire Over the eyes fingers blind Caressing a flower in kind Someone... As the summer dream sheds its quill Who comes to you unseen still? With the hues of a rainbow Who holds out to caress you so? With a song in your ears every beat Who hums to you, Oh, so sweet! Who turns your bitter silence... Into sweet nectar? Someone... Who... Like the brimming cloud... Gives me the pot of never-ending love? Someone... -Ashokan? -Yes? The sun that shines all day without a purpose is really inferior as compared to the moon that lights up the night, right? Yes. You are the moon. What? What? Yeah. When the lily that floats on the night's shore Weds the beguiling moon That it bore... The first scent of love! The eyes of the night sky Gaze at them and don't bat an eye Like... A guardian angel! ARTS AND SPORTS CLUB Someone far away Will sing the song of my heart Who... Like the brimming cloud Gives me the pot of never-ending love? Isn't it cheesy to sketch the man you love? You use a bucket to have a bath near a pond. You're equally cheesy. You saw me bathing? I did. Okay? Your father! Come on! How dare you hang out with a loafer! I won't let you get away with it. Look at him staring at us! Hello. Hello. Ashokan? Yes. Where are you? Why are you whispering? My father is awake. But why are you whispering? Because you are. What? Yeah! Really? Hey, listen. Did your father hit you? He has hit me before. But today he outdid himself. God! It's okay, this was for us. They might be a respectable family. But he is just a clerk in the village office. Yeah! Yeah. We had almost fixed her marriage with a guy in Dubai. He is coming to meet her tomorrow. We tried to convince her but she just won't listen! I'll hang up now. I need to boil some milk. Where do you work, Sumesh? Dubai. You work in Dubai as well? Hey, no! I've been working there for two years. You work together? Shyama, have you ever heard of Burj Khalifa? It's the tallest building in the world. That's okay. I'll take you there after marriage. Don't you like Dubai? So, he works in Dubai? Burj Khalifa. Burj Khalifa! He must be quite tall as well, right? Six feet. Six feet! But, Ashokan... rather than standing tall with a six-foot man all my life... I prefer bowing down to you. Shyju, she has her speech ready! -The Ashoka tree is finally blooming. -Definitely. Hey! -Where are you off to? -Home. Take the other route. -What happened to my rights? -Leave! -Buzz off! -Bloody, Pazhampori! -How dare you call me that? -Go to hell! I have a plan. -Open the door. -Sister? -Open the door. -What's wrong, Indu? She's been ranting all morning. Now she has locked herself up. Father, she'll kill herself if she doesn't marry Ashokan. -I don't know-- -Shut up! Shyama, open the door. -My child! -Sister? -Sister! -Shyama, open the door. -My poor girl! -Move! My dear girl? There are some serious inconsistencies in their horoscopes. However, those can be ignored. But there's a greater concern. Ashokan's horoscope is problematic. His first wife will not survive the marriage. It means that... ;death is certain for the girl who ties the first knot with Ashokan. My child! -Shyama! -Shyama! -Shyama, dear! -Are you alright? -Ratheesh? -Shyama, wake up! -Open your eyes. -Shyama? -Sweetheart? -Shyama! Hey! It happened months ago! Are you still thinking about her? She is in Dubai with her husband. She tried to kill herself for Ashokan. But when she heard that she might die for real, she ran away. We should have bribed the priest! We could have easily changed the horoscope. Now look at him. -And then? -What? I don't want to live at the cost of a girl's life. Marriage is not the only problem in my life! My dreams are dying as well. Don't worry, Ashokan. Son... when a man tries to walk through the maze of life... with a little lantern of his dreams... he inevitably runs into darkness. The darkness weighs him down. But he eventually finds a speck of light. And that is all he needs. You may not see it if you look for it with a broken heart. I've been through this ordeal. And then your mother walked into my life. Your first marriage will end either in separation or your wife's death. That's certain. Ashokan! After losing his kingdom and his men... Emperor Ashoka was forced to flee. But he won his kingdom back, right? Don't worry, there's a way out. I'll help you. You need to marry a tree. A plantain tree! A plantain tree? Hey! Yes, a plantain tree. The tree will be your bride. Treat her as your wife and tie the knot. Do it at dawn. It is auspicious. Marry a tree? Really? Is there another way out? Well... if I look at your horoscope... No, it's difficult. You could find a bride. But I would strongly advise against it. If my mother can see... Lord Krishna in a lamp... Why can't I imagine a plantain tree as my wife? -Oh, my God! -What's so funny, Manoharan? Sir, it says frogs were married to please the rain Gods in Rajasthan. How's that? It could have been worse. -These people are insane. -Let me see. Where is it? Ashokan, which one is the bride? A tree is far better than a frog. But I can't just marry any tree. I will marry a pretty one, for sure! This tree you see here is the finest specimen of feminine beauty in nature! She's slightly fat. She's too old. You are so tall. You are pregnant. Isn't there a single tree for a man of my stature? -Do you like this one? -Yeah. How much does this cost? I want to be like him. -I would let my daughter marry him! -Who? Let me see. That's you! Shut up! Idiot! Ashokan? Ashokan? Hey! Did he sprain his neck? Ashokan! -Where's he going? -He ignored us! Is he campaigning for elections? Ashokan? Mother? What time do you wake up in the morning? At 5:30 a.m. Why? Just wanted to know. Why does he want to pee now? No! He has locked the door. You might think I'm a liar because I didn't keep my promise. It was my father who cheated you. I'll marry you tomorrow. You have Ashokan's word. I'll keep the front door open. Where are my father's feet? Doesn't he ever sleep? Bless me! Bless me, Father! Oh, the wedding of Seetha! How splendid it is! Oh, the wedding of Rama How splendid it is! Mother, three bowls of dessert please! Is that the dessert? Yes, vermicelli. Why didn't you go to work? I'll go after two days. -Here comes the dessert. -Here. One for him. -What's the occasion? -Nothing. -He wanted to have dessert today. -That's good! Ratheesh, when are you and Rani getting married? I have no clue. -Lakshmi? -Yes -Don't you want to start a family? -That's not the problem. She says it can wait until I learn the multiplication table for seven. She must know that. She is a math teacher. -Hey, she knows but I don't. -Okay. But why the table for seven? I have no clue. What is this, Shyju? Is there a serious problem between you and Asha? I know that couples fight, but that's really common. Talk to her and try to work it out. It's not that easy. Besides, there's no profit in it. Your marriage isn't a bloody land deal! I guess you have found something more profitable. Two times seven is fourteen! Three times seven is twenty-eight! -Four times-- -Ratheesh? Yes, sister? -Why haven't you married Rani yet? -I'm learning-- I mean, it's just... Where did you go? I had a meeting with my lawyer Mr. Rasheed. Why? I received a legal notice yesterday. He has decided to end it. Let's go, son. Shyju... Stop it, Ratheesh. Why are you doing this? What did she do to you? Can we please discuss something else? What do you want to discuss? I'm leaving. Shyju, please, don't leave. Talk to him. Shyju, just stop. Shyju, that's not what I meant. Shyju? Shit! Idiot. Why didn't you say anything? What can I do if he has already made up his mind? Forget about it! How's your life? May I tell you the truth? It's going really well! We need someone to stand with us through the ups and downs of life. When I'm late, she waits anxiously for me. Why do you want to be home early? Well... we shouldn't bother the women by going home late, right? Shit! I have to go to work tomorrow. I'm going there for the first time since our wedding. I should distribute some sweets, right? You look way more beautiful in the moonlight. -Who is it? -Oh, no! We should really marry your son off! I'm just gonna keep my mouth shut. Like father, like son! Bye! I'll see you in the evening. That's true! Pradeep, pull over. There are many plantain trees in this place! Yeah. We should cut them down and plant nutmeg. -Get lost, man! -Yeah, I'm leaving! -Go to hell! -Hey, it's my bike. I need it! Hey! That plantain tree from Narayanan's place has borne fruit. It's a top-class plant from Masinagudi. You came for me from miles away You fill my heart with love today Slowly, will you get closer to me? Lovingly, will you come near to me? What the hell is this? Take it away. Useless fellow! You've become the music that I hear You've become the night When love pours, My dear You are the rain And you are the hail You little thief! She's strong. Great! Take good care of her. "Woman delivers a baby on a road full of potholes." Do you know what's happening out there? My parents will be back soon. I heard something and I got really scared. I came here to check on you. Don't worry, I'll be here. You are the shade That keeps sun at bay You are the frost That keeps me cool all day You bring color to my life You keep my heart alive You came for me from miles away You fill my heart with love today Mother? I chopped it down and tossed it at the foot of the palm tree. When I die and leave you forever Will you toss a handful of earth in my memory? When I walk away with the burden of loss Will you pat my cheeks with your tears? Ashokan? Stir-fried banana stalk. It wasn't too ripe. It tastes really good. Ashokan, wake up. You didn't have dinner last night. Have some tea. Ashokan? What do you want, Mother? Why can't you just let me be? Go away and don't bother me. Just go! When I'm born again I want to live my life with you That's when my dreams in all their hues will come true When I'm born again I want to live my life with you That's when my dreams in all their hues will come true When the rains stopped in my life's way The colors of the rainbow faded away When I die and leave you forever Will you toss a handful of earth in my memory? I'll be honest. Office is really boring without you. What happened? Are your parents... alright? Alex, I thought you won't come today. -Praise the Lord! -May He always be praised! Father, this is Ashokan. You can see the condition of this place. It's difficult to sustain. Thank God we have people like Alex to help us. Who would look after these orphans? You seem surprised. It's true. Every child living here is not an orphan. Some of them were abandoned. Have you made friends, my child? Yes. Father, you told me that these are its children. Why are they being taken away from their mother? Well... we have to plant them away from their mother so that they can get enough sunlight... and grow up to be good children. Is that why I'm away from my mother as well? You will grow up to be a smart girl. Come on, dear. Let's go. We have to plant them away from their mother... so that they can get enough sunlight... and grow up to be good children. Mother? Mother? Your father has planted two of its saplings in the front yard. Mother, I'm leaving. Okay, son. Bye, Father. My mind is finally at peace. We have to get him married soon. Yes. What about his horoscope? Come on! It's rubbish. You managed to find a good-looking man as well, right? Really? -Good-looking? -Of course. I was a stud! Every girl wanted to marry me! Yeah, right! But I've never wooed any girl in my life! This is the truth! God! What happened? It's been a long time since you've had this problem. I'll get you some water. You are the perfect melody of my life You complete my dreams You will be my daughter And you will be my son In the pictures that my eyes paint My smile speaks of my luck so great We become one We become a boon Yes, this will do. It's a good match. Goodbye. They seem like good folks. Indhu! Indhu Ashokan! Let's do this as soon as possible. Yeah. -We will go visit her family this Sunday. -Okay. -I'll come get you at 10:30 a.m. -Alright. I have a meeting with a client. What's wrong? Ashokan, we've struggled really hard to find a match for you. But you... Have you seen her picture? She's really pretty. She has a really sweet name as well. Indhu! Indhu Ashokan! Great! Perfect match. I can't do this. I haven't told anyone about it. What? I'm already married. I'm a father of twins. Twins? Yes. One... two. They're twins! But they don't look like... Hey! Go easy! -On this? -Yeah. He has lost it. Yes, that's right. What? You have a black spot in your armpit, right? This one has a similar black spot. Oh, my! It has a black spot. You're right! This is your child. Ashokan, stop fooling around with me at midnight! His wife and twins! Crazy fellow! Go to bed, man! Their horoscopes are a good match. Can we have the wedding in the month of Chingam? -Is that okay? -Yes, why not? Chingam is just around the corner. -Yeah. -Right! This is about you, just smile. Ashokan seems like a quiet person. Hey! Once he starts talking it's difficult to stop him. Am I right, Ashokan? Smile, man! -Have you told them everything? -What? That this is my second marriage and I've twins. Come with me! Hey! He's just bluffing you. No! He told me something a few days ago. I'm already married. Come on! Something's wrong with him. No! I told you the truth! They are my world now. She is Sivakami and she is Sivaganga. Sivakami is a bit naughty. His parents are really happy about his wedding. They are visiting temples and praying to Gods. Poor folks! Don't worry about it. Let's go and talk to him. Hey! Shyju! I had called you several times. Where were you? I got a call from Indhu's family. They want to have the wedding soon. What's on your mind, Ashokan? Marriage? No, I can't do it. Why not? Is there a reason? There are some issues. You can tell us what it is. There are certain things that one can't tell anyone. We know what your problem is. That! And if you want a solution you need to get rid of it. I'll take care of it myself. -Shyju! -Shyju, please don't do that. -Shyju, stop it! -Ashokan, get out of my way! -No, Shyju. -Shyju, stop it. -No, Shyju. -Stop it! -Back off. -Ashokan! Ashokan? His damn plants! Ashokan? Stay away! If you touch my children again... I won't spare you, Shyju! These are your children? Don't you dare touch them! You walked out on your wife and child. You aren't worthy of judging my children. I'm not leaving them empty-handed. I'll give them all the money they want. How much money are you willing to pay... to buy your son's loving kisses? You are crazy. Crazy about money. Everybody in this town will know who is really crazy. What are we going to do? No matter what happens... this wedding must take place. We need to go away for a few days. When his parents return... tell them that we're off inviting his old friends to the wedding. Teacher... I'm entrusting you with the responsibility of my children. Please look after them. Memories, like snowfall, never doom Darkness dives into your plume Clouds of tears burst Into a rain it loves the most I will come alone And be your shade forlorn Everybody in this town will know who is really crazy. No matter what happens... this wedding must take place. Ashokan! Arju, stop there. Look the moon is drowning in the water. Help him! You fool, the moon is up in the sky. Ashokan! I've told you a thousand times. Before you jump in to save the moon look to your right and your left. At least look up at the sky. Do you see your moon? You can't even swim. So what? You can swim. Hey! When we were kids... you would cry your heart out to save the moon. Do you remember how uncle solved that problem? With a spade! Then he would put the spade over his shoulder and pose like Superman. The sky, the moon and the stars haven't changed at all. They are the same. We're the same as well. At least in our parents' hearts. Hey, I was a kid when I jumped in. Yeah, you're some kid! There's the moon! Go! Hello? I need one kilogram of ripe Ashokan! Arju, is that you? When I saw the foreign number... I thought it was the American President Donald Trump. Is Trump your aunt's son to call you at midnight? I'm your aunt's son! But you are busier than the American President. You couldn't get a leave for your cousin's wedding. I chose not to come. I can't stand Ajayan or his mother. He flirts and she boasts. I really wanted to make it to your wedding but it doesn't seem likely. The highly adventurous Navy Commander Arjun... is set to travel the world on a sailboat. I'll fetch a world record for your son. So? Indhu? I like her. She is perfect for you. -Marriage! -Why? Is something bothering you? You are still the same reckless kid who would jump into the water to save the moon. Ashokan, darkness will give way to the light. Not only in the sky but also in your vast heart. When I rise like the waves You rouse like sea When I gush like the spring You turn into river, you see When I light up like a wick You turn up to be its soul You are my smile, my oar You are my succor that's always so close Over the dainty petals of a rose You spread like sun's gloss To you I will return soon You'll bat an eye and I swoon How are you? -Mother. -We've started the wedding arrangements. Come in. -Where's Father? -He stepped out a few minutes ago. Ratheesh? -That's too bad. -Ratheesh? -He acted like a moron. -What happened? -Ratheesh? -Too bad. -What's too bad? -It's-- -Those two would be so sad. -Who? Ratheesh, what's wrong? Ashokan could have looked after those children. Poor things might be so sad. Children? They are just plants, Ratheesh. No, they are children. Sivakami and Sivaganga. Hey, what are you doing out there? The workers will be here this afternoon. -You said that yesterday. -Did I? Okay, I guess, I'll leave. I need to drive the children to school. Right. Right. Come on! Come on! Turn right. Go on. Alright, stop. Right. This house is huge. It will need a large shamiana. I'll start unloading. Stop here. Here's your fare. They've started working. Brother, sister-in-law, welcome! Where's the groom? He's having a bath at the temple pond. Don't worry, he took a bucket with him. Hello! Uncle Keshu! When did you get here? I hope you're all set to have fun at the wedding! -Who's that? -It's Suku. -Suku? -Yes. You're having the same problem? -It keeps coming back. -Everybody seems to have it. -Sister? -Yes. If the twin plantain saps could go, the shamiana will look grand. Cut down as many as you like. But the shamiana should be grand. The shamiana will be great. This is our only son's wedding. -We should have a blast. -Yes, of course. Go and cut them down. Hey! -No. -Why not? -Let it be. -Uncle told me to do it! -Who? -Him. These two have more rights in this house than he does. -Them? -Yes. -These? -Yes. -So, I can't cut these? -No. Alright. I don't care! Hey, Shyju? Hey! -When did you get here? -Just now. I'm not alone. Father! Come here! -He wants to give you something. -Okay. Who's that? Sundaran, love your new shirt! -Ashokan's getting married. -Really? Our Ashokan? -Let's go! -Reverse mode! Full throttle! -Really? -That's my husband Manoharan. He works at the village office. -He is preparing for the IAS exams. -Wow! -He'll be a collector in five years! -Really? Am I right? -How are you doing? -I'm good. Hey! You think Ashokan will be jittery? Ashokan? Really? -No. -No. Look at you, strong man! Is this true, Ashokan? What are you saying? I saw you panic today and I thought... This is my first marriage. I'll do better next time. Thank God! Goddess Muttathara has blessed us! -Goddess Muttathara? -Yes. She is a really powerful Goddess. We went to her temple to pray for my father's hiccups. What? Hiccups! Hiccups. Okay. He gets it once or twice every month. It really hurts him! Is he better now? No, he's not. Your Goddess really is powerful. I think we should finish the milk. Here you go! You have a... mustache! Ashokan? What are you doing? I've been looking for you! Have some tea. Sweetheart! Come in. It's raining out there. What do you think... about your stepmother? Do you like her?
