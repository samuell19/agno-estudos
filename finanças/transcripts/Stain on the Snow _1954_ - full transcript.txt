STAIN ON THE SNOW STAIN ON THE SNOW only seeks to understand one anomalous and anguished case. In the disarray of an invaded country, people can reach the greatest heights of sacrifice and heroism. They can also fall into the deepest pits of degradation. However there is no path astray that does not rejoin the way of the Lord. This is the case with the pitiful hero here, who finds in the end his redemption and his moments of light. Besides, all the people are purely fictional. The action unfolds in a town of Central Europe. Frank Friedmayer is dead. He spent most of his life hating his youth, looking for death. This death that he finally found, terrible and lonely. The death of a murderer. For a long time, Frank Friedmayer hadn't wanted to carry on living. From when he was still a child, from when his mother saw him and said... Here's my little Frank. My son is a darling boy, eh? This is Mr. Léopold. Your uncle Léopold. Well? Aren't you going to say hello? I mean, what's wrong with you? Aren't you happy to see us? Oh yes, mummy. - Frank, you can re-wind the clocks. The dancer or the concert? Any that you want to. Will you come with me, Mme Irma? - Yes. Wait a minute, Lolo. This is all he seems to enjoy. He'll be a watchmaker. He's too sensitive, the boy. He can stay for hours squirrelled away in his melancholy... without saying a word. At his age, you know... he's a child. That's just it, there are moments where he no longer has a childish look. When he has fights at school... He has fights? Why? Over you. Over me? Yes. He defends you. His classmates yell things about you, say rude things, and he fights them. He's never said anything to me. Regardless, Mme Irma, it would be better if you came and saw for yourself. Oh... there's no need. Léopold is a most respectable man. He wants to marry me. You change too often the men who want to marry you. The boy notices it. He suffers. He loves you. But I love him too. Yes, but he loves you alone. Goodbye, mademoiselle. - Goodbye, madame. Goodbye, dear. Behave yourself. - Yes, mummy. Let's go, Lolo. I'll be back next week. Are they going? - Yes. Turn the light on. You can hardly see anything. I'll tell you one thing, Frank. It's very naughty to enter without knocking. I didn't know. You know now. Here are the napkins. Set the table. The wine is in the cupboard. And hurry it up, while I go look for the ham. Frank? Blimey... What's all this then? Tell me, darling, where have you put my pyjamas? I'm worried. He's never there when you look for him. It's the same every time. - This time is different. Ah, here he is. My God, what have you been doing? I fell over. But... you've been wading in the mud. The snow was dirty. Slowly they passed, weeks, months, years, yes, years... everything was changed in the small town. Then came the war. Patrols roamed the streets, silence fell on the bombed-out houses. More and more, the people were hungry and cold There were men who made a fortune, there were cowards and heroes. Mme Irma hadn't changed much in ten years, although lately, she had started to acquire a great deal of money. This was her house. There were carpets, cosy armchairs, a good fire, and as much food as you could eat. Can I put the parcel here? - Of course. What should I call you? - Marguerite, madame. No, that's too long. Call me Moune. That's more like it. Bertha, that's your third slice. Well, I'm hungry. Let her eat, mummy. Watch out. Big thighs are not in vogue. They might come back. Come. So, have you worked previously? No, madame. But you've known men? That I have. Then you've worked. - Yes, in a bar. This worries me somewhat. This is a respectable house, and I expect good manners above all else. Very well, madame. A gentleman who leaves must want to come back. That's what it's all about, building a clientèle. See you again soon, big boy. Yes, if I'm still in town. Goodbye, madame. - It's been a pleasure, captain. And thanks again for the foie gras. Mme Irma, come and see. My room is freezing. This job is impossible in these conditions. I had a hell of a time with the captain. How can I work well in cold like this? Ah, for heaven's sake, the stove was left off. Bertha! You didn't bring up the coal. Your son has the cellar key. Ah, that's true. Wait, girls. Frank! Where's he gone? He's never there when you look for him. He's in that room, madame. Frank, answer when I call you. - I know, I know. Have her come down with me to get the coal, I'm going down. I forgot the key. Bertha. Come on, we're going. My dear, you know I worry, when you go out at night. Don't be too late back. - Maybe, since there's a newbie. I hate these stairs. We're so frowned upon that we get insulted. Not because of what we do, because of the coal. He didn't say anything to you. Mr. Holtz, he's always nice. The lady on the 1st floor spits on the ground. As long as it's not on you. I was called an old trout. - You're not old. Then I am a trout? - You're intelligent. If you don't want to end up badly, be kind. Go and get the coal. Here's the key. Aren't you going to help me? - I don't have time. You have time to come to my bed. It's for training. Frank knew that Suzie Holtz watched his exits. She lived with her father in a room without carpets, without fire, without comfy armchairs. Suzie was a young girl. Hi, Timo. - Hi. Thanks. Your friend Krommer's over there waiting for you. You come here every night now? All the time there are girls like you. He's right, this young man. - No, he's not. You come for the food and drink. Then there's no shortage of girls. - There are never enough. Well, so much the better. It was hot. She had big breasts and clear eyes. She simpered, but it didn't put me off. In making love, I strangled her. Why? - She knew about the jewelry. Plus... she was so soft. And that's how you killed her? In times like these, who hasn't killed in the war, or otherwise by denunciation? That's too easy. Strangling, it's not such a big deal. A little squeeze, and it's over very quickly. You know each other? Yes. - Yes, of course. Your thing with the knives, how's it going? My van is full of them. You should see the latest model. What do you think of this jewel? It goes in by itself. Lend it to me. What for? - No reason. This wasn't created to do nothing. Let's say, I'm going to deliver it. You wouldn't know how to use it. You bet that I can't bring you back a pistol? And then what? Frank didn't even know why he had killed that man Perhaps for the pistol or to prove to himself that he was capable of killing. His gesture made no sense but the fact that Mr. Holtz saw it changed everything. Now, there was Holtz and him. Mr. Holtz, Suzie's father. I haven't done anything! He didn't do anything! He didn't go out yesterday. You can ask. The neighbours will have heard him practising his violin. Tell this to the Kommandantur. [German] A musician. He allegedly killed a non-commissioned officer at the terminus. Who can you trust? - They're crazy, these youngsters. We have fallen very low. We deserved defeat. No more moral values, no more anything. Yes, sir. There are moral values. And there are patriots too. We've just seen the proof. They grabbed him quickly. - Come on, let's go. Poor chap. What did they say? The colonel has kicked off. A little clarion call. He's right, you fool. - You think the same way? You'd do the drunks under the bridges. What about you, in Casablanca? Please, that's enough, girls. You'll end up saying something you regret. Go and get dressed. Frank... - What? Did you know that little violinist? I met him 2 or 3 times on the stairs. What time did you get in? Moune, get that. You were at Timo's? Mme Irma. Hello, Mr. Hamelin. - I can't stay long. That's not nice. Don't you like it here? Mme Irma, I'm always happy at your's. I was teasing you. There's a customer, at this hour? No, he's a cop. Don't worry, he's a friend of my mother. Can you join us, Frank? Hello, commissioner. Good morning, young man. Frank, can you get Mr. Hamelin. something to drink? I'll have one too. A rum, I think. Have a seat. - Thanks. Some gentlemen were busy, last night. A non-commissioned officer was killed a 100 metres from here. We were playing cards. I didn't sleep well last night, but nobody heard anything. No shots were fired, they used a knife. Thank you. His pistol was stolen. It's good stuff, this rum. The best money can buy. Those gentlemen are running the investigation, not us. All I know is that they've found leaflets in the suspect's violin. Another drink? No, thanks. I must get going. There's too much chatter. If we listened to all of it, we'd arrest everyone. At least, it will pay to be cautious. So long, Frank. - Goodbye. Come back and see us. - Yes, I will. See you soon. Frank... You know you can tell me everything. Give me the pistol. Why did you take it? It must be hidden. The police could... I don't know. - Where have you put it? Where have you put it? On the dressing table. Behind the mirror. Not too bright. You aren't going out with that pistol? Where do you want to end up? That's my business. Really, you're doing this deliberately. You want them to arrest you. You're looking for trouble. Get off my back. Why do you always speak to me in that tone? What, in the end, have I done to you, eh? Answer me. Neither of us would like the answer. I've nothing to worry about. I can explain everything. Everything that you blame me for. You'd like that, eh? I blame you, then you explain it to me, we soften, we cry... That would be too beautiful. It's not for the two of us. How wicked you are. You don't care, to see me cry? I've seen you cry so often... As that industrialist said, you cry easily. Madame Irma, a customer. Show him into the salon. Good evening. - Good evening, sir. You going to look out the window now? You spy on me all the time? What makes you say that? Your name is Suzie. How do you know? - I heard your father in passing. Then you spy on me too. - Yes. We're both spies. - However, I'm not curious. Neither am I. It must be something else. Indeed. For sure. Can I come in? - Why not? I'll put the lights on. Don't overdo it. There aren't many lights here. These are yours? You manufacture all these flowers? They've not manufactured, it's an art. People love our flowers. Pretty girls wear them on their hat, like this, or... like this. How did you come to do this? The days are long. The fire is out. - It has been for years. Don't you get cold? - I do my physical exercises. I'm used to it. Is that you, Suzie? I just got back, sir. That's Mr. Limmer. He shares the apartment with us. It was he who taught me. He's an expert in flowers. Good evening. Good evening. This is for you. Have you been working? I've completed the bouquets. I've started on this one. Oh, let me congratulate you. These leucanthemum vulgaris are most successful. What are those? Daisies. Take it. Here's one for you. Thank you. - Come on, to work. We have orders. Excuse me, but Mlle Holtz and myself are going out. Going out? Together? We must run an errand. But you only just got back. She forgot a very important appointment. Yes, very important. Then I'll get started. Don't dally, Suzie. It's not nice, to leave the flowers all by themselves. Good evening, sir. Good evening. I shouldn't be going out. You regret it already? I'm wondering if he'll tell my father. People never say anything. Yes, they do. I'd mention it. - Fair enough. Where are we going? - Dancing. Dancing? Are there places one can dance in these times? At a pal's of mine. It's a stone's throw from here, at the dead end of Rue Verte. It's expensive here. - What else? I'm not suitably dressed. - It doesn't matter. Hi. - Hi. For hors-d'œuvres, foie gras, chops, French fries and Rhine wine, you know which one. Okay, coming up. Take off your coat, won't you? Who are all these girls? Girls who are hungry. These officers? The sort who are hungry for pretty girls. Frank, I want to go. Wait, let's eat first. Here. The remainder is on the way. Well, eat. It's foie gras. What did your father do before? He was an art critic. He wrote books. We travelled a great deal visiting museums. But... what does he do after work? He reads. Poetry. Often, he explains them to me. He doesn't go out, then. Not since the death of my brother. Did your brother die in the war? No. - How did he die, then? He committed suicide. He was 20 years old. Frank. - What? It's important. I must have a word. You can see I'm not alone. - I see. Compliments. Mademoiselle. Your father drives streetcars? Yes. I'm not hungry. Eat, come on. Eat. You know, that's some change, from an art critic to a streetcar driver... Doesn't he ever complain? Why do you keep talking about my father? If you don't want me to, I won't anymore. Quite the opposite, we love each other very much. He's all I have. What about you? What about me? Your father? He couldn't have been anything like yours. Sorry, I didn't mean to open old wounds. What old wounds? Some guy performs gymnastics between the sheets and hup, one's born. Frank, I want to go. Aren't we good here? - I must go to the terminus. What came over you to leave so abruptly? I couldn't help it. You had a mean look on your face. I don't like you like that. You won't see me often, then. Why? I know you, it wasn't you anymore. I'll admit it. I've been spying on you for weeks. Yes. Oh... I'm cold. - Lean against me. What have you got hidden there? It's a pistol. Oh, be careful. I haven't used it yet. I haven't had the opportunity. This is the terminus. Goodbye, Frank. - Come over here. Congratulations, she's a prime cut. - Yes, but she's a virgin. She won't stay that way, with you. - Don't be mean. What do you want? - I'm on to a great deal. An officer wants clocks and watches. You mentioned a watchmaker where you used to live. Yes, I remember. Meanwhile, the general is resolved to pay a great deal. I'm going to take him for a pretty packet. He needs watches by the bucketful. Antiques? Yes, XVIth. But the real thing, eh. He knows his stuff. Clocks with figures? I used to play with them. I can get them for you. What will you do? That's my business. I've never bluffed you, have I? No. Fifty-fifty. Say, are you kidding? I'm doing all the work. I'm bringing the client. - I'm bringing all the merchandise. Your papers, gentlemen. Here you go. Card for tobacco, card for power, bread, meat, soap... Identity will suffice. It's past curfew. I'm taking you in. Green card. Excuse me. Good night, gentlemen. Okay, 50-50, but I need a card like that one. Oh... I'll ask about it, but I'm not making any promises. It's that or the deal's bust. They're very difficult to obtain. So are watches. You know what you have to do. Okay, I'll sort it out. Come to the garage tomorrow. Hi. Here, take this back. I don't need it anymore. I've something better now. Will it be tricky over there? Will it cause trouble? No, they're old. We might need to scare them. - Yes. I don't want to get wet, I've been ages drying out. Are the crates in the car? - Yes. Is three enough? Yes, from what I can remember. Who's there? - Open in the name of the Führer. Where's Vilmos? But sir, you should know that he died two years ago. The keys to the cupboard. - What is it you want? The watches and the clocks. There are more than just these. The clocks are next doors? - Yes. That's where I keep them. The cupboard's open. - Leave it to us. Here are the clocks. Be careful, they're fragile. Who are you? How did you know? He's been dead for two years? He loved his watches so much. They were all we lived for. Get on with it. Okay, okay. - The old lady having an impact on you? May I? Can I sit down? Finished? Go out that way. It'll go better for you if you keep your mouth shut. Excuse me. What? What do you want this time? I wanted to know if you'd come back. I was so worried... Why? I saw you take the pistol before going. What's it to you? It must've meant something to me, because I couldn't sleep. Now you're here, I feel better. Have many customers did you? If you knew how ashamed I am of what I've become... You shouldn't have become a whore. Easy to say. Go on then, let's hear it. Oh... When they found out I was pregnant, they kicked me off the farm. What else? I was in the hospital, then a bar, then another bar, then the hôtel. The child was with you? Yes, he was with me. He was hungry, he cried all night. He got sick. He almost died. What did all that do to you? I thought I was going crazy. So I placed him with a nanny. But that took money. So I resumed, in another bar. I had to sleep with the landlord, with the customers. So here I am. And the child? He's with some good people. I pay. Now he's well fed. If you knew what a darling he is... A child, a woman like you... You should have let him die. Why are you always so hurtful? Do you enjoy wounding others? It's not that. I'm telling you what I believe. I could also tell you some hurtful things. What? What's your point? I can't help thinking about you. I'm worried for you all the time. There's nothing to fear. Soon, I'll have a green card. Here's your green card. They're not easily obtained. Signed by the chef of police? And the regional commander. The patrols should wave you through, but a word of warning: don't overdo it. The money. Your share. Count it if you like. No need. Making any progress with your little neighbour? I felt her up a bit. You haven't slept with her yet? No, but I know she's a virgin. And that tells you nothing? You know, innocence and me have never got along very well. You're too young. You think she's in love with you? Maybe. - I'm telling you, a doll like her, brand new, untouched, with her sense of an abused child... Lucky you. - She's not my type. What do you intend to do? I don't know yet. Well, if you don't want her, pass her on to me. I might have a chance. We'll see. 1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3. You have to dance without counting. Ah? - Yes, you must. Colette, are you coming to dance? Of course. - What about me? Join me. Hello. - Hello, madame. They're keeping us entertained here. We're staying, we're staying, and we're not going. Good for you. Colette, Moune. A moment, girls. We mustn't make a racket. It was them who wanted to dance. We'll have some hassle, especially today. Their police are conducting searches. - They need to be told. Shall I go? No, leave it to me. Gentlemen, excuse me. Your police are in the vicinity and searching all over. It might be better... Of course. "The Nazis in Russia". Thanks for the heads up. Here... Somebody did in an old lady. Where? "The police are continuing their investigations." "The murderers knew the place." "They broke into Mlle Vilmos at night," "and after killing her, they stole watches" "and clocks." Here you go, Colette. I bought you new pyjamas. Try the trousers as well. I would, but Bertha takes everything of mine. I'll be surprised if she can fit in those. Where's Frank? - Still asleep, madame. Frank, you can get up you know. I'm tired. Don't open that. Oh... Why are you looking at me like that? Frank, you don't look good. I didn't ask you to come in and wake me up. It's 4pm, you know. They're not waiting for me at the office. I don't work, I can do what I like. They're at the door. - You want me to open it? The police want to search the apartment. I'll get rid of them in no time. Wait, you'll see. Gentlemen, my green card. Very good. Excuse us, sir. That widdled on their fireworks, eh? Where'd you get that card? They're searching every apartment. - What are they searching for? They're at the Holtz's. I need to enter your home. - Gentlemen, I know these people. You take responsibility for them? - Yes. All right, very well. I haven't seen you for 4 days. I've had a lot on. I've been waiting for you. I've been looking out for you. I thought you didn't want to see me anymore. Why would that be? If you like, we can go to the movies tonight. I wasn't counting on it, you know. Goodbye, Frank. You still here? What do you want from me? Have you seen the newspaper? Someone murdered Mlle Vilmos. Remember, those timepieces you loved so much? Well, answer me. Tell me it wasn't you who killed Mlle Vilmos. Why would you do that? I know it wasn't to steal the clocks. You're always saying... that you are... a villain. It's because I am what I am that you want to be a villain. Frank, have pity on us both. I know that you don't want to answer. You want me to suffer. You want your revenge. You won't forgive me. But I'm begging you, don't take your revenge by destroying yourself. Don't pay for me. Other women... At least, the ones like me, when they have a child, they abandon it. But I couldn't. I couldn't. I preferred to fight for you, and I became this woman you despise, that you detest. And yet, if you knew... If you knew how little it's my fault that I am what I am. I have the preliminary findings... Judge sir, the murderers left the van outside. It left some tracks. Why do you think they knew her? The rapidity of the execution. The neighbours heard nothing. Nothing's been recovered from the scene? - Yes, a shell casing. And an artificial flower, but this doesn't constitute evidence. See? It's a daisy. You've done yourself up. You've become coquettish. - I always was. Where's the daisy I gave up? I lost it. Take it. Here's another one. I'll never cross that portal there. What does it matter, when we're happy? Do you like me? You've never told me. You have to say these things. If I wanted to take you away, would you come? You want to leave? - I'm only asking, to know. And if I asked you to sleep with me? I love you. Do you love me? You have to say so. You must say these things. So, will you come to mine on Sunday? If you like. Why do you love me? Who knows why we love? You're the opposite of what I once thought I loved. Perhaps because you're unhappy. Unhappy? What makes you think that? Oh, Frank... I'm so clumsy. Every time, I hurt you. Hurt me? You couldn't if you tried. You're the unhappy one. - Me? Oh no, why? Look at yourself. Look at your ice-cold room, your fourpenny dress, the misery where you live. It's not misery that makes you unhappy. What then? Say what's on your mind! What makes us unhappy? - You know what. I would like to console you. - Shut up. No. Let me continue. Yesterday, my father was talking about you. He understands you. I don't care about some old loser who drives streetcars. I won't let you talk like this. We're not losers because we're poor, losers are those who have no more hope. Hope? Where do you get these ideas from? You're not a loser when you have money, a fire in the hearth and nice clothes to wear. How I pity you, Frank. What's up? Nothing, daddy. I'm pleased to see you because I'm proud of you, you who doesn't have nice clothes and money in your pocket. Goodbye. Hello, Krommer? Hi, old pal. Say, the girl... Yeah, that one you fancy. It's okay, I pass her on to you. Yes, this is definite, since I just told you. So come here on Sunday. A letter? Give it to him yourself, miss. I don't like the responsibility of charges like this. A letter for you. What are you doing here? Frank! Hey, Frank. Frank! What is it now? Forgive me. The other day I hurt you. Sometimes, I act badly. You want to come over Sunday? I can love you like that, but I love you differently. Differently? Yes. I could have given myself without regrets to someone else. It's not the same with you. I love you, Frank, so I get a bit dreamy. Come on, it's okay. That's enough. Tell me anything you want. I'm your friend, I'd understand. And you dream of our love? - Yes, Frank. I dream of our love, you can't stop me. I see it simply, but with bridal bouquets, wedding rings, prayers, then a wedding day at the end. Why not? It could happen. Yes, but not with me. You've come to the wrong place. Goodbye. Frank, I'll never leave you. You hear me? The bells are ringing. Are you nuts? Close the window, for Pete's sake. It reminds me of Sundays in the village. Me, Pigalle and my man with lots of money. You always look on the dark side. I'm a romantic. It suits you, the line you're in. Bitch, trash! - Cut out the nonsense. Come on, girls. Goodbye, Frank. Goodbye, Moune. Sure you won't come? No, I'm not feeling too good. We'll finish up at the movies. She prefers listening to sweet music. That's enough. I'm not in your way staying here? Why didn't you go out? You know I have a migraine. Then stay here. Are you expecting someone? Go to your room. Is it Suzie? Mind your own business and leave me alone. You smell like a whore. I've just had a bath. Is she here yet? - No. But she's going to come? - Perhaps. Have you told her? - No, she wouldn't come. Besides, she didn't need to know. Come through. Here's the bed. You'll be in the dark. She'll think it's me and it'll be you. But when she realises that... I suppose that it will be too late. You don't think this could turn out badly? Especially in your case, eh? You're not chickening out, are you? You should know what you want. What about her? - All she has to do is not come. Tell me... Why are you giving her to me? You got me a card, I'm giving you a girl. But you said she's a virgin. So what, does that worry you? Considering your age, this is some vice you have. Is it her? - I don't know. Go in the kitchen. Don't make a sound. Frank, what are you going to do? Will you leave me alone? Suzie? - It's me. How warm it is here. The fire is lit? Aren't you happy I'm here? You shouldn't have come. Maybe I spoke harshly, but I wanted to see you. Your hands are like ice. Come on. Do you love me? Do you? Of course. Otherwise, I wouldn't have come. Perhaps you do love me, but you loathe me too. Don't say that, Frank. You could still go, you know. Aren't you going to regret it? No. No, I know I'll never regret it. You know I'm capable of anything? The ugliest things, the most awful? I love you, Frank. I'd love you even if I knew I was going to die from it. So? - I'd accept death. Come. No. - Come. No, please. I'm embarrassed. I'll leave you alone. I'll be back. Go on, she's in bed. Frank. What have you done? Look at yourself. Can't you see you're dying? Frank! No, get off me! - Calm down, mademoiselle! Frank! Mademoiselle. - Get off me! Mademoiselle. - Get off me! Don't leave. - Get off me! No! No! Mademoiselle! No! Mademoiselle! Mademoiselle! - Leave me alone! Don't go, don't go. Nothing happened. Get out. In God's name, get out! Leave me alone, I'm telling you! - Mademoiselle! She's run off like a madwoman in the streets. Frank, her shoes. And her coat. What a wretch you are. Timo? Timo? What are you doing? I'm closing up, it's late. A drink. - No. One last one. - Come on, you've already had too many. You see that guy? I'll put two bullets in him. You'll feel my fist first. Oh yes, that's right, punches. Punches until I die! Shut up, you're depressed. Stop screaming like that. Death is the only genuine thing, you know. Because afterwards, we're at peace and don't think anymore. No more thinking, you understand? Shut it! - No more thinking! Where do you think you are? In your dive, you black marketeer, you sell girls and you go home in the morning, and once there, draw the curtains. You have your wife, your children. I can't do that. I couldn't act like you! I couldn't! - You disgust me! I disgust myself even more. What have I done? Eh? What have I done? If you knew... I don't want to know. Scram. My floors are already dirty enough. Get out! What have I done? What have I done? My God... What have you done? I fell. But you've been wading through mud. The snow was dirty. The snow was dirty. Frank? Where have you been? You've been drinking. Come in, quick. I remember, one evening, you were with a lover, uncle Léopold. What on earth are you talking about? Come to your senses, come on. Frank, please. Please, listen to me. You must leave, right away. I have to leave? Why? Maybe it''s not too serious. When she recovers, people will forget. Frank, do as I say, get out. No. The house will side with the girl against you. Her father might look for vengeance, to kill you. He'd be within his rights. He'd be acquitted. Her father will kill me? Hello, madame Irma. You, at this hour? Alas, yes. I hoped not to find you here. Why? - Where did you get that flower? What's it to you? Tell me. Find out, you're the cop. It's not just me. There are other cops, Germans. They want to talk to you. They're waiting for you. So, he's under arrest? There's nothing I can do. They can't arrest you, with the documents you have. I'm begging you. What's he supposed to have done? I'm begging you. What's he supposed to have done? Hamelin? Hamelin, say something. What's he accused of? Frank wanted destiny to take him. He had defied it from dawn to dusk. However, he never thought it would happen like this. We may have to wait a while. We're early. You say it wasn't you? Come on. Here's my green card. Frank Friedmayer, unknown father, son of Irma Friedmayer, proprietress of a house of prostitution. Yes. A pistol, a wallet. 25000 Francs. 2 photos. Sign here. Come. Here. This is your cell. That's all very well, but where do I go? For the time being, the prisoner remains here. There's no more room. You're a prisoner as well? - Oh no. I was a school caretaker. They've put me up here, luckily. Otherwise, I'd be on the street. The bread?... Thanks. I can't see much. At least here, I don't need to see well. I'm very used to it at my school. It's been turned into a prison? - Ah no. It's not a real prison. What do you mean? Here you're released, or you're executed. I must go and feed the dogs. They're calling me. They belong to the police? - Yes. Once upon a time, it was the cries of kids I could hear. Now, it's them. Like everyone who loses their freedom, Frank marked with a sign his first day in prison. He didn't know what he was accused of, what they'd found out. He didn't know if he was going to deny it, defend himself or confess. The dawn found him like the sick who toss and turn in bed without being able to sleep. What is it? Someone's going to be shot. You can see it from the window. They shoot somebody every day, at dawn. Before going through the gate, the man raised the collar of his jacket. Yes. They all do that. The opening of the gate sends a big chill through them. You slept with the girls at your mother's? Sometimes, yes. Was there one you preferred? Bertha? Moune? Colette? One to whom you told your events, your business? No. You slept with them and you didn't talk to them? Let's say I used the minimum words. Your mother received officers, officials. Why do you keep looking out there? I'm looking at the house opposite. The woman on the third floor has her window wide open. She's young. She comes and goes. She does her housework. She's happy, no doubt. She must be married, because she's watching a crib. Happiness indeed. Yes. There are those who never know it. Friedmayer, follow me. Frank. Hello, Frank. My boy, what do you look like?... Hello. These gentlemen gave permission to come and see you, to bring your effects. For 10 days we didn't know where you were. It was Mr. Hamelin who informed us. Here's some linen. You can have a change, my boy. I've put in a suitcase your wool scarf, white shirts, handkerchiefs. You needn't have bothered. I don't need anything. We've been so worried... Ah, you had the time? Not many customers, eh? You're still the same. You don't like anyone trying to get too close. Perhaps you're right, but I can't stop myself trying. Forgive me. All your friends are wondering how you are. I don't have any friends. However, there are people that love you. Madame, the visit is over. Thank you, sir. Goodbye, Frank. Goodbye, Frank. You know, Suzie is still in hospital. I've heard she's recovering. However Mr. Holtz hasn't returned yet. Yes, sir. Take care of yourself. Be careful. Don't go out on a limb. Goodbye, Frank. You know, Suzie is still in hospital. I've heard she''s recovering. However Mr. Holtz hasn't returned yet. Another alert. Come on. Sit! Sit! Get off him! How did you get in? Come on, you must go. It's forbidden. I saw him, Frank. He was there. Yes. He came. He's very different... I hardly recognised him. He came from another place. Another place? Yes. The hell he lives in, that mother he can't love and that he loves all the same. Daddy... He looked like a dead man. - Come on, my girl. Come on, calm down. Sleep. Get some shut-eye. Come on. What was that? Who's there? Don't be alarmed, madame. - Someone knocked, I opened... It's me. Frank. There was bombing, we made a run for it. They'll look here first. You have to get out of here. Go the the farm where my kid is. They won't find you. - It's your only chance. Come on, we can go together. Don't flap. There's bound to be soldiers in the street. Perhaps not. Bertha, go and check. - Right now? Of course, go on. Okay, if you say so. Stay here. You'll be able to detain an escapee. Very well. You can go, nobody's there. They took him. Mme Irma just saw it. That'll teach him. What? You did it? You gave him up? He was always giving me crap. I warned him. You have to be nice to people. Frank Friedmayer? Yes. Well... You've been thinking, I trust. You've had some time, given your flight. I don't know what the accusation is. - You don't know? Nevertheless it was on you that we found this. This is a great deal of money, don't you think? Yes. Well, I want to know who gave you this money. I got it from various sources. - Well, well. You put it in your pocket without a second thought? Yes. - No! This is a lie! Stand up. Come and look. Tell me this is any old money. In the right-hand corner, there are these tiny little holes, see? 10. It's the same with all the money in your pocket, and with those that you spent. Well, these notes were stolen. Not by me. They were stolen from a safe in GCHQ, by an officer. At all costs the thief must be found. That's the issue here. This is why I've been arrested? - Yes. And now, we'll have a nice talk. Sit down. Cigarette? If you tell me what you know, you can go back to your old life. Your evening excursions, girls, the whole lot. I'm sorry I have nothing to tell you. Be careful. You are going to talk. No. - You don't know what awaits. I don't care. Are you starting to get the idea? You know a certain Krommer? He's the one gave you these notes. I know this much. So why question me? Who gave them to him? Answer! If I'd asked, he wouldn't have told me. You knew each other well enough that he'd tell you! We weren't close. Don't play the fool. It's in your best interests. I don't gave a damn about your officers! Friedmayer, be careful! I'm running out of patience. So am I! Do whatever you like! I don't know anything! How can I make you understand this? I don't believe you, Friedmayer! You're going to talk! I'm sick to death of you! Can you believe that? Friedmayer! No! No! Well, feeling better? You had a rough night. It's nothing. Wait a minute. Oh, Frank... My God... They've kindly allowed us a brief visit. I brought Moune. She's always thinking of you. My child, I must talk to you. Have no fear. I'm not afraid. Frank, those who you believed were your friends are not. You know who I mean? People have told me. Who, for example? Mr. Hamelin. I know you won't like this. You're wrong. Why have you come? This is it. He's convinced that you let yourself be detained, but that you won't confess. As he puts it: "It's a fake point of honour." I have no honour. Don't say that. I know you're not wicked. You know more than me. Listen, Frank. You must speak the whole truth. They'll take this into account, I'm certain. I trust them. Like you'll trust them even after they've shot me? Don't you think I've suffered enough? I can withstand anything. But to see you like this, you, my son... Calm down, madame. Moune, tell him that if he confesses, he'll get out of here. They've promised me. We'll take good care of you. Madame, your time is up. - Yes, sir. Frank, don't protect those who don't deserve it. Think about what your mother's said. Goodbye, Frank. You won't kiss me? Goodbye, Frank. There's another request to visit you. Me? Who's this? Mlle Suzie Holtz wants to see you. Mlle Holtz? Oh no, not that. I don't want to see her. I don't want to! Why won't you see her? It's my right, I don't want to. I refuse to! Is that clear? No, it's not clear. She's coming all the same. No, it's possible. It can't be. I'll talk. I'll confess everything, on condition that she doesn't come. Okay, I'm listening. I stole the watches and I killed Mlle Vilmos, the watchmaker's sister. I also killed one of your officers to obtain his pistol. I've committed an action much more shameful. I've committed the greatest crime in the world, but this one is no concern of yours. I'm not a fanatic, nor an agitator, nor a patriot. I'm a louse. I've been trying to buy time, hoping maybe to save myself. But now when you can promise to save my life, I no longer want it. I want to die as soon as possible, and have nothing else to say, because there's nothing more I know. Good. We've reached the end. So, it seems you've confessed to that which you weren't asked about, and that you continue to refuse to tell us what we want to know. I've told what I know. However, when Krommer got his hands on the money, he wasn't acting alone. You were there. It wasn't me. - Why would he lie, Krommer? You need to ask him that. Too late. He hanged himself. It's only you that can talk, and we'll make you talk. I swear I know no more. We'll see about that What? Sentence of execution has been passed? Yes, madame. I've received the order. They will shoot him tomorrow. My God... But you told us he would be pardoned. I didn't say that he couldn't be saved. So what do you advise? It's difficult, but there have been more serious cases we've been able to arrange. I know lots of people. but it's Christmas. Where to find them? What can I do? I know who to see. He's not someone important. He's a subaltern. It'll require a great deal of money. - I have some. I'll do anything. I'll sell everything. Do you have the money here? Yes. Wait. This subaltern won't take the money and do nothing? - It wouldn't be the first time. If you doubt me, I'm leaving. No, come on, please. Colette, shut up. Take it. We'll give whatever it takes. I trust you, me. We'll save him. It's that woman with the balcony. In this cold? No. Now, she's indoors, with her husband, her child. They've put up a Christmas tree. For the festivities in school, I'd go looking for a big tree. Mlle Clémence would spend all day decorating it, and at night, the children would gather round and sing. It seems straightforward, like that. A woman, a man, a child... and a Christmas tree. Indeed it is straightforward, in times of peace. In times of peace... Friedmayer, it's for you. What's this? Maybe they're going to free you. You may enter. I ask your forgiveness. Your mother came to see Suzie. She's trying to save you, but you don't want it. My mother's been to see you? Did she speak to you? Yes. She was so unhappy. She loves you, Frank. She hasn't had an easy life. You shouldn't judge, my boy. You should know how to forgive. My mother, poor thing... We can't live as we'd like. We live as we must. I had a boy your age. He committed suicide. He wanted to be a great doctor. One day, expensive items went missing from the laboratory, and they caught him on a train stealing a wallet. When they were going to take him to the director's office, he jumped from a window on the 5th floor. That was that. The task of being a man is not an easy one. Thank you. Frank, why? You see, Suzie, I wanted to be no better than my mother. I always felt alienated from life from love. I thought I wasn't cut out for this. So when I started to love you, I attempted to be tough, to be insensitive. And if I punished you, and if I punished myself, it's because I love you. Don't cry, darling. No, leave it, leave it. Oh, leave it. I couldn't cry before. Today is like our wedding. One always cries at one's wedding. Yes, Frank. Yes, one cries at weddings. You remember what you said with... with your prayers, your rings, your bridal bouquets. We're not going to get all that, but... it's our wedding all the same, eh? Yes. Oh yes, Frank. Yes, Frank, our wedding day. Time's up. The visit is over. No! No! No, Frank! You have to go, Suzie. Don't grieve. Death is not so hard, when you've had your share of happiness. "Your share of happiness..." Yes. An undreamt of happiness, one we couldn't imagine. A happiness we didn't even deserve. Oh, Frank... Frank, I... I've loved only you. I'll love you always. Me too, Suzie. I've never loved anyone but you. Come on, come on. Come. - No. Come on, we must go. - No. No, Frank! - Come on. No! Daddy! No! Farewell, Suzie. Farewell, Frank. She's your fiancée? Yes. It so happened that I lived my entire life in one minute. Frank Friedmayer. Why are you looking at me like that? You can play your song now.
