That's the most I got is 3,000 bottle of cr?me de menthe*. * Peppermint-flavoured liqueur. You got things pretty much your own way now, haven't you, Louis? Sure. Everything is just fine. That's good. But Pete was saying just tonight... He say that the South Side, she's get out of line. I say, what are we gonna do with the South Side? Let some of the other boys get theirs, too. I got all I wanted. Johnny Lovo, he's talking about starting something. Yeah? He's looking for trouble? Johnny's very foolish! Look at me. A man always got to know whether he's got it or not. I got plenty. I got house. I got automobile. I got nice girl. I got stomach trouble, too. Better get some sleep. All right. Well, she was a pretty good party? Next week, I'm going to give the party which the boys ain't never seen nothing like it before. We'll have much more music, much more girls, much more everything. Everybody, should say, "Big Louis, he sit on top of the world!"? - Goodbye, Louis. - Goodbye, boys. Take good careful of yourselves? - Bye. - I see you some more. Hello. I want Lakeside 417, please. Yeah, 417 Lakeside. Sure. That's the wrong... No, I want Lakeside 417. Hello, Louis. How many of them? All right. Copyboy here. Copyboy! That's rotten! "Costillo slaying starts gang war!" That's what I want. I'm working on that angle now. - I've got four men on it. - Four? You'll need 40 men on this story for the next five years. You know what's happening? This town is up for the grabs. Get me? You know, Costillo was the last of the old-fashioned gang leaders. There's a new crew coming out. And every guy that's got money enough to buy a gun is going to try to step into his place. You see? They'll be shooting each other like rabbits for the control of the booze business! You get it? It'll be just like war! That's it, "war." You put that in the lead. "War. Gang war." Here come the coppers! Hello, Rinaldo. You coming along? Where's Camonte? - Hello, Guarino. - Come on. What's your hurry? I'm getting a massage, too. We'll finish that at headquarters. Put your coat on. I got lots of time. Who wants to see me? The Chief. That kidney foot? Never mind the jokes. How's it look in the back? Very good. Come on, you rat! "Tony Camonte, aliases Cabrone, Joe Black. "Assault, carrying brass knuckles and sap, DW*, disturbing peace. * Possession of a deadly weapon? "Street robbery on three counts, loft burglary, violation Volstead Act. "Indicted for murder of Buck Kempner. "Member, Five Point's Gang, came from New York, 1920. "At present, bodyguard and strong-arm for Louis Costillo." Bodyguard for Costillo? Pretty smart boy. I suppose you didn't kill Louis Costillo? Who, me? That's very funny. Big Louis and me, we're like this. Can I slap it out of him, Chief? I'll let you have him in a little while, Ben. This fellow got ideas I don't like. Costillo hired you for a bodyguard. Where were you at the shooting? I was having my beauty sleep. Where? In a lady's house. You want her name? Phone number? She's very nice. We'll go into your alibis later. You've been hanging around Johnny Lovo, haven't you? Lovo split with Big Louis. What were you doing at Lovo's house last week? Now listen, Tony, I'm gonna give you a chance. You play ball with me and I'll play ball with you. Last night, you met Johnny in Spinelli's Barber Shop. What did he give you money for? Now listen, you. What kind of mug you think I am? I don't know nothing, I don't see nothing and I don't hear nothing. And when I do, I don't tell a cop. You understand? All right, Guarino, you can have him. Thanks. Come on, Tony. We'll take a look at the goldfish. Here's Epstein. Hi, boys. Hello, Chief. All right, let's have it. Writ of habeas corpus for the release* of Tony Camonte and Guino Rinaldo. * Requires a person under arrest be brought before a judge or into court, especially to secure the release for lack of lawful grounds. - Who gave it to you? - Flemming. All right, gentlemen, see you later. - I don't go with this guy? - No. Listen to me. You've come into this town and you think you're headed somewhere, don't you? You think you're gonna get there with a gun, but you're not! Get me? You know why? Because you got $1,000 bills pasted right across your eyes. And someday you're gonna stumble and fall down in the gutter, right where the horses have been standing, right where you belong. You got me all figured out? I've spent my life mixing with your breed and I don't like it. Get me? You can hide behind a lot of red tape, crooked lawyers, some politicians with the "gimmes", writs of habeas corpus, witnesses that don't remember overnight, but we'll get through to you just like we got all the rest! Maybe me, I'm different. No, you're not! Take your gun away and get you in a tough spot and you'll squeal, like all the other rats. You're gonna get me? In your particular case, I'd give up a month's pay for the job. Are you gonna see Lovo? Yeah, right away. Tell him to stay undercover. I'll come up tomorrow. Hey, what's this writ you got me out on? Habeas corpus. Deliver the body. Can't hold you without booking you no matter what they think you've done. That's a fine idea. You tell Flemming I want lots of them. - Hi, Boss. - Come in, Tony. Glad to see you. Hey, that's pretty hot. Silk. Expensive? I see that Epstein got to you in time. Yeah. Nice little fellow. He give them a writ of hocus pocus. - Sit down. - Thanks. He said you stay here till the heat's off. He said... Hey. That's pretty hot. That's Poppy. Poppy. Meet Tony Camonte. How are the coppers taking it? I didn't pay much attention. What about the newspapers? Yeah, I bring them along. The News has got the best story. Pictures of you and one of me, too. Where did they run it, in the razor ads? That? That's an old business. You'll get used to that. I got it in the war. War with a blond in a Brooklyn speakeasy. Some kidder? It takes a long time with the pinchers? You've got an office for this sort of thing, Johnny. Why don't you use it? There you are, Tony. That's a bonus. Hey, that's a nice feel. That was a fine job, Tony. Remember, that's only chicken feed. You've stepped into big company. You stick to me and do what I say, play square and you'll be walking around with lace pants and a gold hat. - You know what I mean? - Sure, I know. Now, listen, I'm gonna cut you in on a percentage. Give you a raise, double. The South Side is rolling in jack*. All we gotta do is step in and take it. * Money. And have some fun with O'Hara, too? Who? Now wait a minute. O'Hara's too big a guy to buck now. There's lots of jack on the North Side. Now, listen, you. You let me think up the ideas. I'll take care of that big hop in my own way when the time comes. I say we stay out of the North Side. I say we leave O'Hara alone and what I say goes! Don't ever forget that. - You're the boss. - That's better. From now on, next to me, the boys take orders from you. Me and you? That's fine talk, Boss. Here. Have a cigar. There'll be plenty of work for everybody. Costillo slowed down too much. And now he come to a dead stop. Here, you better smoke one of mine. That's pretty nice. Expensive? I don't like cigar smoke in my room. Do you mind? Listen, I'm gonna hold off that meeting with the boys a couple of days. After Big Louis' funeral, it's better. You know what I mean? Sure, sure. It don't look so good. And I want you to send some flowers. A cross of white carnations from me, see? And I send lots of purple, a bunch. Big Louis he always liked purple. Why don't you go and do it now? You better make that meeting Monday. Tell all the guys that want to run beer on the South Side to be there. Tell them I'm gonna make a speech. You know what I mean? Well, goodbye, Poppy. See you again. She don't like anybody but me. She's a very busy girl. Expensive? Here, Little Boy. Easy dough, for just standing outside and listening to a gun go off? - Cinch. When are we gonna get some more? - We'll get plenty. There's business just waiting for some guy to come and run it right. And I got ideas. We're working for Lovo, ain't we? Lovo? Who's Lovo? Just some guy who's a little bit more smart than Big Louis, that's all. Hey, that guy is soft. I could just see it in his face. He's got a setup, that's all, and we gotta wait. Someday I'm gonna run the whole works. Remember, those monkeys on the North Side ain't so soft. Yeah? Say, they're satisfied, ain't they? Why didn't they come and take Big Louis before we did? Listen, Little Boy, in this business, there is only one law you gotta follow to keep out of trouble. Do it first, do it yourself and keep on doing it. Where's Cesca? - I don't know. She go out. What do you mean? Ain't she coming home for dinner? I don't like that! You tell her I want she should come home for dinner. Understand? Sure. I tell her lots of times. "Come home. Come home. Tony no like." Still she don't... That's a nice way I catch you? What do you mean, "catch me"? I wasn't doing nothing. - You was kissing him! - Sure. What of it? - Well, I don't like it! - You're missing lots of fun, Tony. Listen. I don't want anybody kissing my sister, understand? You're hurting my arm! I don't want anybody putting their hands on you. - What do you think you're doing? - I'm your brother. You don't act it! You act more like... I don't know, sometimes I think... I don't care what you think! - You do what I say! - Sure, and never have any fun. "Never have any fun." You call that fun? Running around with guys like that. That's fun! Listen, you want real fun? Here. How's that? Gee, Tony, where'd you get it? Never mind where I got it. You just spend it, see? You're swell. Go on, get ready for dinner. And remember, you do what I say. No more fellows, understand? What for you wanna give her money? Well, she's just a kid. She wants to have fun. Yeah? Sometimes I think you crazy. Cesca! What for you take that money? - 'Cause I want it, that's why. - Give it back! It's bad money! Tony no got it in no good way. Gonna bring you lots of trouble. What do I care where he gets it? There's nothing wrong with his giving it to me. Tony wants me to have a good time. Yes? You listen. Tony no love you like he make you believe. All of the time he smile on top, but what he thinks... He's got lots of tricks! He no give money to nobody for nothing. He would to his sister! Sister! That make no difference. To him, you're just another girl. Someday, when he needs you, he mix you up in his business just like anyone else. And he's gonna make you bad like him! He can't make me do anything I don't want to. I'm gonna live my own life. I can take care of myself. All of the time Tony say like that. Afterwards, he no belong to me no more. He's no good! And now you start to be just like him! No, I'm not. Don't worry about me. I'll get along all right. That's all right, boys. Just changing the name on the door. Meet the new president, Johnny Lovo. Hi, boys. Where's Berdini, Zeigler, Meehan? Anybody see them? I did. They ain't coming. Is that all they said? They said you could take a flying... Now we know where they stand. All right, you guys, I'm making a speech. Here it is. Big Louis gets a wad of dough and then he gets soft. He lets you guys come into the South Side and run beer. Well, I'm gonna change it, see? You can still stay in but from now on you're operating the way I say. Are you asking us or telling us? I'm telling you. We're gonna get organized and I'm gonna handle the works. It's gonna mean twice as much dough for everybody and half as much trouble. - You got something figured out, Johnny? - Everything. Not being able to get it's gonna make this town thirstier than ever. Running beer ain't a nickel game anymore. It's a business, and I'm gonna run it like a business. Swell! We've been cutting each other's throats long enough. There's 3,000 saloons on the South Side. Half a million customers, figure that out. Add up what they're gonna lay on the line every year for drinks and nobody in charge. So you're going to be it? Yeah, "it." That's me! I make my own beer and I got my own trucks. I don't have to go into business with nobody. - Where you going? - Who wants to know? You sit down here! And don't interrupt the president no more. All right, President. - Well, are the rest of you guys in or out? - I'm in. What about Meehan? Yeah, Berdini and Zeigler? Why, they've been selling to 700, 800 joints between them. Yeah? Well, from now on they're out. Those joints buy from us. Sure. If you try to sell at one of those places, Meehan'll turn this side of the town into a shooting gallery. Fine! Anything he starts, we'll finish. You guys don't have to worry. All you gotta do is to haul beer. Yeah? Well, who's gonna stick his neck in those joints and get the orders? My friend, Tony Camonte. Yeah, I'm what he call a good salesman. I start right now to get orders, Boss? All you can get, go to it. Hey, dope, got a pencil? Boys. I don't write. That's one. Come on, Little Boy, business. - Ever eat at home? - Once in a while. You get all the samples here. Here have your beer. Hey, what is this? Let go of me, will you? What do you want? Let go! - Say, what's the big idea? - Sit down! - Who're you buying your beer from? - Meehan and Berdini. - How many barrels a day? - Three. He's lying, Tony, he's been taking five. Chiseler. Well, you're getting eight now, see? And you're buying from us. Johnny Lovo. - But, listen. I can't... - Sit down. I can't use eight barrels around here! I get you a hunk of soap, you take a bath in it. - What do you paying a barrel? - Fifty! Well, ours is 65, it's better! You get delivery tomorrow. What am I gonna tell Meehan and Berdini? We'll take care of them, don't worry. Well, that's order number one. Now we get plenty more. There's a system to these things. How many barrels did you say you wanted? Six. Yeah? Well, you're getting 10. You're getting a delivery tomorrow. There's no use arguing with this joint. Zeigler runs it himself. Step on it. Hi, Boss. Lots of garlic. Get me some, too. Well, how's business? You get some more orders? Lots of orders. They all buy from us. All we have to do is fill them. It's a good idea. You better tell Meehan and Berdini. Them fellows, they retired from business. They what? What've you been doing? You remember you say all they have to do is start something, we finish it? - Well, did you? - About an hour ago. - You mean... - Kid. - Extra here! - Come here. - Keep the change. - All right. Thanks. Here you are, Boss. There's your South Side all nailed up in a box. All nailed up in a... Yeah. Well, you didn't get the lid on very tight. - What do you mean? - Look at that. Keep this hot. We'll be back right away. - You can't come in here. - Come on, get out of here. No, it's a private hospital. You can't go... What did they do? Hi, Poppy. What's all the time biting you? You afraid of me? Well, that outfit's enough to give anybody the yips*. * Make nervous. Nice? I got three more. Different colors. I see you're going in for jewelry. It's kind of effeminate, isn't it? I got them in an auction. A bargain. You sure are a funny mixture, Tony. That's the first time you smiled. Well, how do you mean, you think I'm funny? You just are, that's all. What else are you doing with all your money? I hear you're getting a new car. It's different. It's got bullet-proof glass and a steel body. And I got myself a new house, too. Come up sometime? I'll bring my grandmother. No kidding. You come up? Why don't you get yourself a girl, Tony? Well, I'm working on that now. Well, don't tire yourself out. Johnny in? He's mad? Hi, Boss. When are you gonna learn that I am the boss? Sure, you're the boss. Then what do you mean by breaking up that Lakeview joint last night? Didn't I tell you to stay out of the North Side? Now, listen, Johnny, it was easy. Now, you listen to me, stupid! That was one of O'Hara's places and you know it. Didn't I tell you I wasn't ready for O'Hara yet? It was a nice little order. Fifty barrels a week. I don't care if it's 50 a day! What do you use to think with, an empty beer keg? Just when we get this territory lined up and running smooth you step out and gum up the parade. How do you mean, Johnny? I just sell a little more beer. Don't worry. Don't worry? You know what O'Hara's liable to do now? He'll send his guns down here on the South Side. They'll move around like hummingbirds. You're liable to get it and I'm liable to get it. I know that hop. He's tough, see? He ain't so tough. Hanging out in a flower shop. You afraid of a guy like that? I ain't afraid of anybody. Sure, you're not. That's a crazy question, Johnny? - Come on, don't argue. - Where you going? To clean up after you, you mug, unless it's too late. Look out! It's Keach! Hello, this is Mr. Camonte's secretary. What's the name, please? Secretary, I told you. Secretary, you dope. Secretary. Okay, Boss. No. I no talking on you. I was talking on Mr. Camonte, that's my boss. Get a name. What's your name? No, I no wanna know what's your brother's name. I wanna know what's your name. You do? Listen, I come on over there, I smack you right in the teeth. - I get you, your brother... - What's the matter? That's no way to talk. Talk nice. Tell him to state his business. Go state your business. Who was it? I don't know. What do you mean, "I don't know"? Didn't I tell you always to get a name and write it down over here? Boss, I forget again. What are you writing there? I don't know. I can't write. Can't write? That's nice. A secretary that can't write. A secretary must be able to write. Must be educated. Get an education. He cannot write. Education? That's your fault. This Mr. Camonte's... No, please, you're wrong. I no hang up on you. I thought you was through. I told you before. You have to write a letter. You have to make... You do? Let me tell you... Shut up, you. What's the matter with you? You crazy? Listen, the last time I tell you... You pick yourself a nice one. You get one for me? Didn't have time. Was there any trouble? No, it was easy. - How many were there? - He was alone. Hello? Who is it? I don't get... Boss, I don't get the name. Who? Sure, send her right up. That's Poppy. It's better nobody see you with this. Hello, handsome. Well, Poppy. Hello, Tony. They tell me O'Hara was killed in his flower shop this morning. Had you heard that? - Did Johnny send you up here? - Johnny? How do you like this place? - Kind of gaudy, isn't it? - Ain't it though? Glad you like it. Come here, I show you something nice. Steel shutters on all the windows. My own idea. In case you have visitors you don't like? That's right. How do you like the view here? You see that? Someday I look at that sign and I say, "Okay, she's mine." You think so? I got a pretty good idea. That's pretty hot. Expensive? Come here. I show you something what's pretty hot. How do you like this place? Come here. Here's some stuff I buy. Aren't they sweet? You like? I'm gonna get some ties made to match. See, what I'm gonna do is wear a shirt only once. Then I give it right away to the laundry. A new shirt every day. You're just gonna drive the women mad, aren't you? One of them. Meaning me, I suppose? Feel it. It's got inside springs. I bought it at an auction. It's a bargain. Go ahead, sit down. Try it. It's all right. You like it? I thought you were Johnny's friend. Sure. I like Johnny, but I like you more. Excuse, Boss. Cops is downstairs. All right, tell them to come in and sit down. I'll be right out. I don't wanna be caught here. This is a mess. It's all right. Don't get excited. It's easy. Great. Thanks. Poppy. After I get through with them, I'll meet you at the restaurant at 4th Street. - All right. - Go to the left. Hello, Guarino. You all alone? You're a cute fellow, coming here all by yourself. You ain't afraid of me? No, nor 10 like you. The Chief's waiting. Angelo, call up Epstein and tell him that... Little Boy, call up Epstein. Tell him there's a kidney foot here taking me down to the Chief's office. Tell him to come right down with habeas corpus, understand? You know, I just hear O'Hara, he was met with a terrible accident. That's too bad? So Camonte thinks he's going to run this side of town, now that he's got O'Hara. He's getting too big. He won't get any bigger. We'll take him before he finds out about these guns. Three hundred slugs a minute. Get the rest of them unpacked. How many we got? Plenty. There's a lot more coming. O'Hara had them run in across the line* last night. * State line. We'll have the cops on our necks. Forget it. They can't do anything about it. There's no law against bringing guns into the state, and we can buy all we want. - What a cinch. - You said it. Gaffney, listen, Camonte just left headquarters. McGill's trailing him. He's gonna phone. You guys. Load those guns. You get the cars ready. Stick the hearse in front of them. Then to the South Side, and I want everybody. - Now you hang onto that phone. - Right. Snap into it, now get going! Hello, Tony. Have a seat. What took you so long? The moxie, he was late with the habeas corpus. Go on, order some food, will you? I'm hungry. Every time I see you, you look better. That's a cute hat. - Please, my stockings! - What's the matter? Well, don't do that, Tony. They're brand new. - Hands off? - No, feet. You know, I know lots of girls. I know redheads, I know blonds, and all kinds. They all like me. You're pretty good? I'm the best. Are you gonna eat by any chance? I'm not hungry. Except for you. You got something I like. I'm nice with a lot of dressing. You work fast, don't you, Tony? No. Say, I've been waiting a long time. I'm crazy for you. Everybody say, "Tony Camonte, he's a big shot! "He's got everything he wants." I got everything but what I want. You understand? Pardon me, telephone for Mr. Camonte. Dope, go see who it is and get a name. This Mr. Camonte's secretary. What's your name? I say what's your name? This Mr. Camonte's secretary. You have to speak louder. I can't hear what you say. That's too loud! Talk lower! Please. Don't be a fool, Tony! What's the name, please? I can't... Hello? Please, I can't hear what you say. That's O'Hara's mob. I can't hear what you say. It's too loud. Lookit! They got machine guns you can carry! If I had some of them, I could run the whole works in a month. I'll get you one in a minute. That's swell. Look, it's little, you can carry it! Let's get out of here. Boss, there was too much noise. I didn't get their names. That's a dope! Too much for him. Bring him upstairs. That's all right. The back door. Lookit. They've been here too! Look at that. Come here. Get me some shells, let's see if she works. Call Fugatti, tell him we want three cars, right quick. Johnny, look what I got. You dirty murdering mug, you bumped off O'Hara! Who, me? That's foolish. You told me to stay out of the North Side. I stay out. I've been home all day! Little Boy? Sure! So that's it? I told you to lay off! I don't hear so good sometimes. You won't be hearing anything if you go on like this! Look what happened to me. They clipped me! Lookit, Johnny, you can carry it around like a baby! Shut up! We gotta get organized. This is only a starter. They'll be back after us. What do you mean? We don't give them time. We go after them. We throw them Micks* up for grabs. * Irishmen. When you're laying in an alley with your head blown off, maybe you'll learn how this business ought to be run! And who's gonna do that? O'Hara's mob, Gaffney. He's running it now! He'll give it to you here, a pound of hot lead in the belly. Make sure it's him, Johnny! - Cars are here, boss! - Little Boy, it's business. You fix who goes in each car, understand? - Where do you think you're going? - To the North Side. - Like I always knew someday. - You can't do that. What do you mean "can't"? Who's stopping me? I am. I'm giving you orders for the last time. There's only one thing that gets orders and gives orders! And this is it. That's how I got the South Side for you and that's how I'm gonna get the North Side for you. Some little typewriter? I'm gonna write my name all over this town with big letters! - Stop him, somebody! - Get out of my way, Johnny, I'm gonna spit! Come on, fellows! Tony, take this along in case that bean shooter doesn't work. - Come on, Dugan. - All right. - You see what happened here, kid? - I don't know, mister, but they said a big black car with side curtains, and a machine gun gave them the works. Hello, Ben. - Hello, Chief. What do we gonna do about them machine guns? What can we do about them? There's no law against manufacturing them, just against having them. If they can't get them in one state, they go across the border and get them in another. These fellows bootleg machine guns like they bootleg booze. They better do something about that because with these toys to play with, what happened before will look like a tea party. I know it. So you better put the screws on the 22nd Street freight house. I hear they're bringing them in in fruit boxes. Right. - Get that guy's number! - Somebody get an ambulance! What's the matter? What is this, a pinch? No, just bringing you a valentine. Don't you know it's Valentine's Day? I forgot. Line up, you guys. Over there. All seven of you. What's the gag? Is the heat on? Plenty! Face the wall! Put your mitts up. All of you! Here's Gaffney. Gaffney, what do you know about this? I was on my way here to the garage to keep an appointment. And I was late. And a car drives up and some guys pile out. Two of them was cops, at least they was dressed like cops. Cops! That's a new gag. Then what? It looked like a pinch. So I beat around the block till it was over, then he picked me up. Lucky you were late. Take a good peek and see what you missed. Seven of them. Lined up against the wall. Mowed down, just like that! They didn't have a chance. Sit down, Chief, you're wearing out the carpet. I'm the only one left! Thinks he'll get me? Fat chance. Who's there? McArthur from the Journal. Let him in. - Hi, Gaffney. - How'd you find me? We boys from the Journal always get around. Anybody else know I'm here? Nope. It was just my own little idea. Sit down. You're going to stay for a while. Can't get a thing on him. We're right up a blind alley wherever we go. And Gaffney's turned yellow, and he's hiding out. - What about Lovo? - Lovo is practically out. He's as scared as Gaffney. It's Camonte all right, but we can't prove it yet. No, but we will. - Say, Chief? - What do you want? - This fellow, Camonte. - What about him? A story. Public's interested in him. He's a colorful character. Colorful? What color is a crawling louse? Say, listen, that's the attitude of too many morons in this country. They think these big hoodlums are some sort of demigods. What do they do about a guy like Camonte? They sentimentalize, romance, make jokes about him. They had some excuse for glorifying our old Western bad men. They met in the middle of the street at high noon and waited for each other to draw. But these things sneak up and shoot a guy in the back and then run away. - I guess you're right, Chief. - Colorful. Did you read what happened the other day? A car full of them chasing another down the street, broad daylight. Three kiddies playing hopscotch on the sidewalk get lead poured in their little bellies. When I think what goes on in the minds of these lice, I wanna vomit! Ben? See if you can find Gaffney. He'll probably get it next. They got all the others. Right. Our organizations are opposed to your policy, Mr. Garston. Your paper could be an influence against the gangster, yet you keep right on playing up his activities as front page news. Murders, gang wars, killings, that's all we read about! You're glorifying the gangster by giving him all this publicity. You're trying to tell me you can get rid of the gangster by ignoring him? By keeping him off the front page? That's ridiculous! You're playing right into his hands! Show him up! Run him out of the country! That'll keep him off the front page. In the meantime, you expect our children to read of nothing but outrage and murder? That's better than their being slaughtered. The city is full of machine guns. Gang war in the streets. Kids aren't even safe to go to school. You want that to go on? Certainly not! But what can private citizens do? Even our police force can't stop it! Don't blame the police! They can't stop machine guns from being run back and forth across the state lines. They can't enforce laws that don't exist! Then it's up to the federal government to do something about it. You're the government! All of you! Instead of trying to hide the facts, get busy and see that laws are passed that'll do some good! For instance? Pass a federal law that puts the gun in the same class as drugs and white slavery! Put teeth in the Deportation Act! These gangsters don't belong in this country. Half of them aren't even citizens. That's true. They bring nothing but disgrace to my people. All right. I'll tell you what to do. Make laws and see that they're obeyed if we have to have martial law to do it! The governor of New Mexico declared martial law to stop a bull fight, the governor of Oklahoma to regulate oil production. Surely, gang rule and wholesale law defiance are more of a menace to the nation than the regulation of oil or a bull fight! The Army will help. So will the American Legion*. They offered their services over two years ago! And nobody ever called on them. * An association of ex-servicemen formed in 1919. Let's get wise to ourselves. We're fighting organized murder! That Sadie Thompson, she's a pretty smart girl. What's a girl wanna hustle in a place like that for? It's raining all the time. That rain, that's pretty good. That comes from a pipe, you know, just like a shower. Them two fellows... Which one do you think she takes? The guy with the collar? He ain't so hot. Listen, them Marines ain't so hot, too. I go take a smoke. That's a fine show. I gotta see more shows like that. You know, serious. Ain't got no jokes. I like a show with jokes. That's a dope. What more do you want? Listen, this girl, Sadie, she's got what you call a problem. This fellow with the collar, he's gonna... - What's the matter? - They found Gaffney. Spotted him down at Frank's Bowling Alley. He's got into a game. It's a setup. Take about an hour to get the boys. I'm looking at a show now. Listen, it's the last act now, see? There's two fellows after a girl. She's called her name Sadie, see? Now this girl, Sadie, she's been, what do you call, disillusioned. We gotta do it now! He's liable to slip us again. He's the last one, Boss. Come on, Tony. That's too bad. All right, come on. Wait a minute! Now, you stay here. You stay and see the show. - Boss. I gotta know which fellow this girl, Sadie, she take. You stay here and find out, and then come and tell me. It's all right, Boss. The copper's gone. All right. Come on. Little Boy, you go around the back, up on the balcony, grandstand seat on Stanton. Pietro, side door. He may have friends, you never can tell. Joe, I want you stand in the alley. If he gets that far, you do your stuff. You keep the motor running. Bring the present. You stay here. Come on, fellows. Now we'll know what happened to that girl, Sadie. Angelo, did she take the guy with the collar? No, she climb back in the hay with the army. That's fine. She's a smart girl, I think. What're you doing? Not bad? Just watch this one. Hello, Tony. That's pretty hot. Hello, stranger. Chair. Well, Johnny. You're looking swell. I thought we were gonna see something of you. Here I am. Where have you been? On a vacation? I've been working. Up on the North Side, Johnny? That's what the papers say. Don't work too hard. I just finish up tonight. Now I play a while. You got your own table, Camonte. What's that? This is a table for two. Well, maybe you get another table, Johnny? Listen, you. Who do you think... All right, go on. Nothing seems to bother you much, does it? Well, I get used to noises. - Hello, Guino. - Hello, baby. Why are you always high-hatting me? Go on, beat it! I suppose you need an organ grinder to work with? Tony's inside. He see you in that outfit? I looked pretty good from two stories up. Am I different now? Wanna dance with me? Listen, you're Tony's sister, see? Besides, you're only a kid. I'm 18. You like that music? Now do you wanna dance? Afraid of Tony's sister! Why you... I noticed you stood there and watched. Someday you'll find out you've been missing something. How about it? You and me? I thought you weren't dancing? I've changed my mind. I need exercise. We show them something? I think you missed me? That's right. We make up for lost time. How do you wanna play, Tony? Like this? That's good. You wait here. I take her home myself. - You can't. - Shut up! You'll be sorry for this! Next time I catch you in a place like that again, I'll kill you! You're telling me what to do? I'll do what I want, same as you. Understand? You listen to me! I hate you! Never mind what I do. That's all right! But you're gonna stay home. Understand? I'm no baby! I can take care of myself! Running around with fellows? Letting them hold you like that! Letting them look at you! Dressing up like that for fellows to see? What I do with fellows is my business! - Mama. - Cesca. What's the matter? What did Tony do to you? What'd he do? He hit me. He said he'd kill me and I wasn't doing anything! I was only dancing. That's all right, figlia mia*. * My little one (daughter). No cry. All right, tell Mama. Come on upstairs. No cry, baby. He hasn't any right to. Just because I'm his sister he can't throw me around like that. No. All right, no cry, baby. I tell you. I tell you lots of times. He hurt you. He hurt everybody. Pour a little on those tires. Right. That's got him. Just shut up! Get me some nickels! Hurry! Lakeside 1305. Get me a drink. Is this Jim? Tony Camonte. Is Rinaldo there? No, Mr. Camonte. He left an hour ago. - Is Lovo there? - Lovo? No, he left, too. Said he was going back to the office. Bosworth 4503. Mabel? Camonte. Rinaldo there? Why, no. He ain't been here. Say, you know, I think that guy's giving me the runaround. I've had a date with him two or three times... Maybe he's going home to bed. What are you talking? - That tomcat? - Try Maizie. Maizie, that's right, I forgot about her. Hatfield 6401. Maizie? It's Tony Camonte. Rinaldo there? For you. Rinaldo. I'm at Pietro's. Pietro's! Come right away. Anything wrong? Plenty. Go get me a towel. I thought you weren't doing anything tonight? I'll be back later. This is worse than being in love with a grasshopper. It took you a long time to get here. - Who done it? - I don't know. But I got a idea. You just wait. How do you stand with Lovo? - Who's Lovo? - That's good. Say when. That's enough. You call Johnny Lovo at his office at 10 minutes past 2:00, see? That's 10 minutes past 2:00. You say that you're calling from the country now, see? You're one of the guys that took me for a ride. The car got smashed and I got away. You think it was Johnny? I don't know. But we'll find out now. We'll be there when Pietro calls. And if it was Johnny, he'll stall, won't he? - Sure. - Let's go. Open the door. Tony, where you been? What happened to you? They spoil my brand-new suit. Who, coppers? No, monkeys. Never seen them before. Somebody must have brought them in. How did they get you? They smashed my bus, took me for a ride. Almost. That's right. You left there alone. You ought to know better than to do that. Where were you? I thought you always stuck to Tony. Baby, I'm glad you got away. I'd have missed you plenty. I'll get somebody for this. I knew you would, Johnny. That's Poppy. I don't wanna see her tonight. I'll tell her you ain't here. Wait a minute. I'll talk to her. Who? No, there's nobody here by that name. What? Ring off. You got a wrong number. You better have a drink, Tony. It's a lie! I didn't do it! I wouldn't try anything on you, Tony. We're pals. Sure, we're pals. No. I didn't do it! You got me wrong. Listen, Tony, I brought you out here. I worked with you. You're the last guy in the world I'd try to cross, you know that! You wouldn't do anything to me! Don't take me, Tony! Give me a chance! You can have anything I got, anything! All the dough you want. Poppy! I'll let you have her! I give you my word! You can have Poppy, Tony! I'll tell her! The boss! Let me go away. Give me a break. I never did anything to anybody! - I never hurt anybody! - No. You get somebody else to do it for you! Wait! Don't! Tony, come back! What's happened? Where's Johnny? Where do you think? Go pack your stuff. Come here. Look at that. Do you remember what I told you? Tony isn't here. He's out of town. You're telling me? Why did you hang up when I called yesterday? Too busy. The one on the end's kind of cute. She ain't bad. I should think you'd want something more like... Like what? Me. Cut out that sort of talk. You're only a kid. I told you I had grown-up ideas. You're like Tony when you go after something? What would Tony say? He'll be away for a month. The big fellow's on his way from Florida. Well, he'd better watch his step. This town's entirely different than when he left it. That new crowd down at the City Hall is looking for him. The first crack he makes, they'll climb all over him. Hand it to Hap. Tell him to play it for what it's worth. You stay out here. - Tony. - Where's Cesca? She get a place of her own. She say to me, "Shut up. Mind your business." Just like you say. Well, is she living alone? All the time that's what she tell me, but one day I follow her. She meet a man. They go in the house together. I look and I see her name under the push bell. See what you do? Once I have a son, I have a daughter and now... Ma... Where is the place she live? 236, Central Street. What you gonna do? What you... Tony, no! Stop! Central Street. He was going downgrade Making 90 miles an hour When his whistle broke into a scream And they found him in the wreck With his hands on the throttle Scalded to death by the steam It's a mighty rough road From Lynchburg to Danville And the track's on the three-mile grade It was on this road That he lost his average You can see what a jump he made Hello, baby. I'm so happy. You're telling me? You do love me, don't you, Guino? You know I do. Never stop telling me, will you? I'm not like all the others, am I? You're up there all by yourself, sweetheart. We'll always be happy, won't we? Tony, don't! Guino, speak to me! Say something! Tony, he's my Guino! I love him. We were married yesterday! Really married! We were going to surprise you! Weren't we, Guino? Darling, speak to me! He's dead. He loved me. Really loved me. Don't touch me! Don't come near me! Stay away from me! You're not my brother! Don't you think I know? Murderer! He kills people! He kills everybody! He kills everything! He's a butcher. That's what you are. You're a butcher! Drive down to the house. Come on, Boss. Go on, beat it! Get out of here. Come on! Mr. Comante's secretary. You have to speak louder. I can't hear you. It's Poppy, Boss. I got her name. I didn't know. Tony, what is it? Tony, say something. He did? Did you get the rest of them? All right, let me talk to Duffy. All right, Ben, here's what you've been waiting for. Camonte killed Rinaldo. Put up a fight when they tried to take him and holed up in that steel fort of his. Get him! Take Madden and his whole outfit. I'll send you more if you need them. Wait a minute, Duffy. Don't lose any men. Block off the street. Put your lights on and smoke him out away from his guns and he'll quit! Get going. Duffy? Send those monkeys on in. Tell Jake to stay put. Quick, they're coming! The police! They're after you! They're gonna get you! Why didn't you shoot, Cesca? Why didn't you shoot? I don't know. Maybe it's because you're me and I'm you. It's always been that way. Three of you fellows, go on that roof across the street there! You two cover that alley back of the house. Right. What are we gonna do? What do we do? Come here, I show you what we do. Tony, they followed me! This is my fault. I shouldn't have come! What's the difference? Your fault, my fault? Just so you're here, that's all what matters. Here, you load them? Sure I'll load them. I'm not afraid. I'm like you, Tony. That's the way to talk. You're not afraid? Come on, we'll show them. Here, here. Put it here, Cesca. Put it right here. We'll show them something. Look at the monkeys there! They think they're gonna get Tony Camonte? Cesca, wait, I'll show you. Look, Cesca, see? Steel, all steel! Solid steel! No one can get in here! Cesca, you and me? We'll show them! We'll lick them all, the North Side, the South Side! We'll lick the whole world! Let me lie down, Tony. I'm all hollow inside. Cesca, what is it? Where? It doesn't hurt, really. Just put your arms around me, Tony, just for a minute. I won't be able to help you now. You can't go away. I won't let you, you understand? I won't let you! So dizzy. Hold me, Tony. Don't let me get scared. Listen, you don't understand. I'll be here all alone! You can't leave me here all alone! Why, Tony, you're afraid! Don't be afraid, Tony. You're all I got left! Little Boy, he's gone! Angelo, he's gone! I'm no good without you, Cesca. I'm no good by myself! They're out there! They wanna get me! They're all there! Cesca, they won't give me a chance, please! Guino wasn't afraid! Cesca, don't go. Please, Cesca! I won't let you go! You hear, I won't let you! You understand? You gotta stay here, you hear me? I don't wanna stay! You're afraid. Guino. Cesca, please. Come back, you hear? Come back, I say! Hurry up with that gas. That second window up there. All right. I can't see! Angelo! Little Boy! I can't see! Break it down! Stop! Don't shoot, Guarino! Lookit, I'm all alone. I got no gun, see? Give me a break, will you, Guarino? Break? Who'd you ever give a break to? Look at me. I got nobody. I'm all alone! Little Boy's gone. Angelo is gone. And my steel shutters, they don't work. Shut up, Camonte! Give me a break, will you? Don't shoot! You got me covered. I can't do nothing! Give me a break, will you? Listen, don't shoot me! I told you, you'd show up this way. Get you in a jam without a gun and you squeal like a yellow rat. Climb into this.
