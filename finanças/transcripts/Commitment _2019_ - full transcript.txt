COMMITMENT ASLI I'll introduce you to Jenny in a minute. She's been in our country for a few years now. She's from the Philippines and is very experienced in baby care. She has references from very good families. Let's check to make sure the information is complete. Jenny... 34 years old. No bad habits. Fluent in English and speaks a little Turkish. Oh great. She's not a live-in nanny, is she? You stated that your house is available for a live-in-nanny. Yes, it was... but after our experience with Diana, we told you that we changed our mind about a live-in nanny. I'm not sure if it was you or someone else, but the person we spoke with took note of it. Well, it is not noted here. You were supposed to get back to me in a week, but a month has passed. I told you that it was very urgent. But now you are offering me a live-in nanny. You're right. It is our fault, but, believe me, we have a long waiting list. And now you are next in line. I can't wait for another month. I will get back to work. I see... We'll try our best to help you. But, since you have come all the way here, I suggest that you at least meet Jenny. Maybe you'll change your mind. Ayla, can you send Jenny over here? Hello? I told you we've got nothing to talk about. Stop calling me, please. Hi. Isn't she sleeping? I put her to sleep, but she wakes up every five minutes. Come my dear... Oh, my legs are numb. I told you not to rock her to sleep on your legs. I really appreciate it... Thank you. I ironed Mr Faruk's shirts... I'll finish up the rest next week. What's that? I have to go to Mrs Muazzez; we've got work to do. She's already been waiting for me for an hour. But you were supposed to cook, too... Say hello to her from me. Welcome home... Thanks. How are you? Good. Same, as always... You're gradually getting your old figure back... Oh, I wish! But, that's still not happening. How was your day? They called about the nanny... And? What happened? I'll tell you more about it later.. How are you? I was in at the work-site all day. I didn't get to eat anything. What's for dinner? What did you make? Fatma didn't come today, did she? - She did... - So? She left early... How come? What for? Your dreams have come crashing down, I guess? Yes, frankly speaking, they have. I made tuna salad. There's some leftover potato salad. What's up with the little monster. She seems quiet tonight. She is sleeping in her room... Well that's a change... Didn't go through again? From the Philippines... Has good references, She looks like a decent woman, but she is a live-in nanny. But we told them we don't want a live-in nanny... This has taken too long Faruk. I'm getting so upset. Me too... You should've scolded Fatma. How dare she leaves early! She had to go to your mom. Whatever... Didn't you like the salad? I can make you an omelet if you want. It's nice.. The salad that is. The dressing is different. It's a Catalan sauce. The recipe called for sardines, but I used tuna instead. Did you like it? It needs a sprinkling of flaked chili peppers. Thanks... I am afraid we'll eventually going to end up with Fatma. But Fatma is so rude, Faruk... If Fatma is our only choice, I'd rather stay at home, and take care of my child myself. I mean it... OK, whatever. I talked to HR today. They're going to let me know which branch I can start at. You told me not to interfere, and so I haven't. You don't want my mom; you don't like the baby sitters. But you want to get back to work as soon as possible. Asli! Wake up she's crying! Asli? Come on... She's crying, come on... It's ok, Sweetie, it's ok. I have a ton of work to do tomorrow? Come on. Food is ready... Here you are... Yes? Open your mouth, Dear-One Come on, Zeynep, why aren't you eating? Won't you eat? OK, so now what do we do? OK, then, let's not eat. Come on. You want the breast? Well, here you are... Of course, we don't recommend it at such early stage. However, it is your decision. If you have financial reasons pressuring you... I'll go back to work as soon as I find a trustworthy nanny. Your breast milk is fine. You can pump and store it in the freezer. I do try that, but... somehow Zeynep hasn't gotten used to it. She just won't accept it. I tried to mix it with formula, but she spits it out at the first sip. She has to suck from the breast. Naturally... Doctor, I know it sounds funny, but I read about some old school methods on a website. They wrote that using pepper and vinegar can help to wean the baby. Yes, such methods do exist... Excuse me. Those methods are not good for the psychology of the baby. She senses that you have breast milk. As long as you have breast milk it's going to be hard to wean Zeynep off of it. Several sites also mention the name of a drug. They say it stops the flow of breast milk. Is that true? Yes, there is such a medication. It suppresses certain hormones. Can I use it? Sure... Zeynep has already been on breastmilk for six months. As we see it, that's long enough for her health. There have been no reports of adverse reactions to the drug thus far. However, it can cause some side effects. Really? What kinds of side effects? Irregular periods, nervousness, exhaustion etc. It doesn't happen to everyone of course. It depends on each person's metabolism. As far as Zeynep knows, she and you are one single organism. The child's realization that she is separate from their mother's body, is the second greatest trauma for the baby, the first being the actual birth. We call it 'the bonding' trauma. It is a delicate situation for the baby. And for you as well. She is going to be more restless than usual. She will cry. Her sleep will be very irregular. But she will get used to it eventually. OK, please prescribe the drug for me. OK. I'm also going to prescribe a vitamin supplemented formula. Zeynep, what's the matter? Why are you crying? Are you hungry? Are you hungry, Sweetie? Zeynep... It's OK, Sweetie please don't cry... It's OK, Hon, don't cry. Here I come Honey... Come my sweet girl. Yes my dear... Yes. Here you are. Well done good girl... Well done my dear... - Asli Durali? - Yes, that's me. - Who sent this? - I don't know. It should be written on it. Please sign here. - Have a good day, - Thank you. Hello, Seval. She's started calling again. I wouldn't have answered, but she changed her number. Seval, tell her not to call me, OK? I don't want this. She's upsetting me. She sent me a gift package today. I don't know what it is. I didn't open it. I just tossed it in the trash. That's enough! Is she psycho or what? How am I supposed to let go of it? Alright, Seval, OK. Alright. I'll try to calm down. Can you bring me the coffee when it's ready please? OK my dear... Where is this girl's mommy? Where is she? Is she in the garden? Call her to come back, Is that you Asli? Where've you been? I just wanted to get some fresh air for ten minutes... I kept calling you, but you didn't answer... I didn't take my phone with me... Bravo! Well done! Really! Great! You take her. Why are you shouting? I am not shouting, am I? I mute my phone not to wake her up! When you go out, undo the mute then, so that I will... Alright, Hon... Try to get some sleep. What is it Sweetie? Why are you making a fuss? Are you hungry? Let's clean you up. Come on, Hon, OK. OK, Sweetie, you're hungry. Your food will be ready in a second. In a second, Dearest. I know, I know... I know, you're hungry. Yes dear, just a little patience... Your food will be ready in a second. Yes dear, yes my dear.. What is going on? She never cries this long. We're waiting for the formula to warm up. Couldn't you just breastfeed her while it's warming up so that she stops crying? She needs to get used to formula. Why didn't you go to sleep anyway? How can I sleep with all this noise? Yes, Sweetie, it's OK. The formula is ready. Could you hand it to me? Yes, dear one, it's warm already. My daughter's food is coming. Yes dear... Yes my dear... Here it is dear. Here it is, yes Sweetie. Thank you. You're welcome. Let me ask you something... Go ahead... What do we call that brick made out of baked soil, slag and cement? Asmolen? Where did this come from... I came across it in a crossword... Thanks... Any other questions? Nope. May I ask you something then? Yes? Is there any other way to switch to formula without making her cry? Does it bother you? I put up with it all day. Have a little patience. Why am I not included in the making of these decisions? And what is all this about then, Faruk? Right. You are going to do whatever you want anyway. You're trying to provoke me... What did we decide? What? We promised to make our decisions together, right? You've always known that I'm planning to go back to work... Just a little while ago you were telling me not to bring food from my mother without asking you first. Then why don't you ask me when you are ordering food? Now, you are making a hodge-podge of everything. I'll go crazy... It's going to be very hard. I can tell you that. Hard for Zeynep and for us as well. You see that too, but you insist. Faruk, I am going to go back to work. OK? Whatever it takes; I'm going to go back to work. And you just have to accept that fact! Couldn't you wait for just a few months more? I don't want to forfeit my legal rights. You can start at another bank. You can find a different job. What's the rush? You're getting me really upset... Really, you're getting on my nerves... OK. Alright. Then, I can take paternal leave... for two months and I'll take care of her... That way you won't have to forfeit your legal rights. Yeah, sure. You couldn't even take care of her for 10 minutes tonight. Couldn't stand just 10 minutes. Take care of this babysitter issue. I don't want to talk about it anymore. OK, My Dear, good night to you! Hello. I had a meeting with Mrs Ayca. - She's right there inside. - Thank you. Mrs Ayca? Hello. I'm Asli Durali. - How are you? - I'm OK, and you? I'm very well, thank you. There will be a vacant position at the Carsi branch next week... Carsi branch. That's great... May I know the position? Personal client relations rep. The branch is located pretty close to your house. True, It is very close-by... However, it will be a downgrade for my career... I suggest that you look at the bright side... You have a baby, you won't have to work overtime. Yes, but I'm not sure. When you take a long break, returning gets harder. Believe me, this is a much better solution for you. I've missed work and I'd love to return as soon as possible, but I'm not sure if it makes sense or not for my career. Well then, give yourself some time to think it over. Let me know by Friday. There're no other openings then? Not right now. I'm back... Welcome back darling... Yours is sleeping inside. Asli used to work in a bank. She was an assistant manager before she had the baby. Are you still breastfeeding? We are trying to get her used to formula these days. How is that going? Zeynep protested quite a bit initially, but she accepts the formula when she's very hungry. Isn't it a bit early? You mean to get back to work? No, it's about time actually. Oh... Well done, yours are fine like pencils... Oh really? Thank you? Let me see... Oh my... Amazing. Thank you. Mrs Aysel? Will you be available to look after Zeynep? I could only manage if I lived closer to you. But getting to your house by 8, and leaving after 6 is pretty much impossible for me. I can come over though to help out once in a while... I see... Thank you... I mean, I would love to look after Zeynep when Asli starts working again, but it is just too hard for me to do that everyday. I am not as young and healthy as I used to be. Come, let's look outside... Oh look! Look at the flowers. Mr. Hamza is going to come to straighten up our flowers. Where are the birdies? Have some tea. Thank you very much Mrs Asli. Not at all... These flowers are so pretty. We couldn't take care of them, they all dried up. Don't worry, I'll bring them back to life. Thank you. Mr Hamza, a few months ago, you mentioned a young woman who was looking for a job. - Your neighbour. - Oh? Yes... Did she get a job? Why do you ask? We are looking for someone to take care of Zeynep. Of course, we would have to meet and get to know each other. Don't worry. I'll talk to her tonight. Thank you very much. I would be so grateful. I'll let you know. Come my dear... Where are we? Where are we? - Dad? - Welcome home. Thanks Dad. I thought you were coming tomorrow. I must have gotten it wrong. I told Seval we were coming today. Is that so? Whatever... Where's Faruk? Didn't he come along? No, I came on my own. Faruk is extremely busy these days. So I thought I'd visit you before I go back to work. Had you quit your job? There's some stuff in the trunk. Can you give a hand? You shouldn't have gone to this kind of trouble... It's nothing, Dad... Are you hungry, Hon? I'll bring your food right away. Where are you off to, Dad? I have some business to attend to... I'll handle that and will be back. You rest... Dearest. I'm really surprised that dad still keeps putting out the newspaper. Are they still selling at a time like this? Nope. He has only 23 subscribers. He told me that the other day. Never mind; he is occupying himself with it. How is he managing to fund it? How? You know the land along the river? He sold it. That was supposed to keep him afloat until he dies, but it only paid off his debts. He doesn't even talk about it with us. Never. So this house is all we've got now. What is it? Well I am not even sure about that though. What are you saying, Seval? He took out a bank loan last week. He mortgaged the house. What? - Is he out of his mind? - I wonder what his problem is. Oh Dad... How could you? - I'm going back to work on Monday. - Really? At the same bank? Yes... At the Carsi branch this time... I'll try to help you out like as I used to do before. We'll pay off that mortgage. - Don't worry about it. OK? - OK. Here you are, Sis. Thank you, Dear. It tastes good. Enjoy. Thank you... Why? What did I do to to get a thank you? She hasn't called since yesterday... She is planning to return to Turkey for good in the near future. So? She bought a flat in Kartal. She's going to move there... Really? I didn't have any idea... She's wondering if she'll ever get to see her granddaughter. I'll ask Zeynep when she turns 18. If she wants to see her or not. I'm not sure she's going to live that long. Why? Is she sick or something? She had a heart attack last year. She was hospitalized and spent a week in intensive care in Berlin. So, she does have a heart after all... Why don't you listen to what Mom has to say? Sit down and talk. Maybe you'll understand her better, I mean... Talk about what? Talk about what, Seval? What is she going to tell me? Do you think we have something to talk about? She should've thought about that when she left us when we were 7. Let's change the subject. I don't want to talk about this anymore. Did you get a haircut? My beautiful, Seval. Well anyway... You can rest as long as you want. I've got tons of exam papers that need marking. OK... Where did you get stuck? Top down third column. First two letters are E and E. Have a seat. Let me see... From left to right, the forth slot... If it ends with C, you can make it "Bloc." - So that makes this one "EEC". - Of course. So the question should be: "What was the acronym for the previous name of the European Union?" EEC Like always, you found the missing link. Are you OK? Yes, Dad. What about you? The tea should still be warm; let me pour you some. I can get it myself... You can put it here... Have you worked somewhere else before? I haven't had the opportunity. I finished high school. Then marriage and getting used to living here... Where were you living before? We're from Kastamonu. - Is your husband also from there? - Yes. What does he do for a living? He is doing his military service right now... He used to work as a mechanic at a car repair service... He's an electrician.. Very good. Very nice... When were you born? Oh dear, You are so young. Do I seem so? Yes, sure. You look even younger than your age. I also have a daughter. Do you? Yes she's 8 months old... Didn't Uncle Hamza tell you? No, he didn't... I hope you don't mind... Of course not. On the contrary. I was just thinking about how this could work out. I live with my mother-in-law. She's going to look after Ayşe... Our house is very near here. - Can I hold her? - Yes, sure. Come on... Have you weaned her yet? Since I'll go back to work I'm trying to get her used to the bottle. I'll be back in a minute... Is she asleep? Yes... She passed out... Come let's put her to bed... Then I can show you around the house. And show you how to prepare her food. OK. This is her room... Come... Come my dear... Yes my dear... You understand me... Yes my dear... Can you hand me my bag please? My love, bye bye. See you. I'll call you OK? OK. Have a good day. Mommy and daddy gone? Now it's only us dear. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. - Hello... - Yes? I was looking for Mr Serdar... Isn't he here? Mr Serdar has transferred to another branch. I can help you. I am your new Representative, Asli Durali.. I've applied for a personal loan. But I was missing some documents. Let me have a look. - Can I have your ID? - Sure. May I have your client number? 6641173 Well, you don't have an online banking account. If you want, we can open an online banking account so you can make these transactions from home. No need Dear... Excuse me. Yes Gulnihal? Is it urgent? OK, I'll call you right back... Excuse me... Yes, are we opening the account? Don't bother with that My Dear, I cannot manage that by myself. I had a hard time learning how to withdraw money with the debit card. Yes, Gulnihal. What is it that you couldn't find? What are you going to do with it? You're going to blend banana and yogurt. I'm not sure, check the second drawer. If it's not there... Check the cabinet under the oven then.. Just check over there... I'll talk to you later. Ms Fatos, can I have the new files please? - Thank you. - You're welcome. Is she asleep? Lovely... What are you doing? Is the TV on? Who? Fatma turned it on? Please tell her to turn off the TV. I have told her several times. I don't want Zeynep getting used to watch TV. OK? OK, alright. Call me again if you need anything. OK, see you later. She's turning the TV on! What are you looking for? The glass grater. The glass grater. What for? I'm going to puree some fruit. The nanny must have put it away somewhere. We'll find it. We spoke in the morning. She asked me where it was. I told her it's in this cabinet. Why didn't she put it back in its place? I hate that. - Is this it? - So, she put it there? By chance. How many do you want to eat? One'll be enough. Take this dear put it on the table. My lovely girl! Come here... Come to Mommy. What have you done? I missed you so much! I missed you a lot! Did you bake this cake? No, my mother-in-law made it. Mine never turn out quite right. I've tried a few times but they're never as nice as hers. We don't always have to do everything perfectly, do we? No, we don't have to Sister Asli. Let me get a bite of this cake. Can you hold Zeynep? Today we went out for half an hour. What's that? Who's we? The weather was so nice. I didn't want to bother you. This condo doesn't get much wind, it is tucked away in a corner. It was even hot. Why didn't you call me? My mother-in-law dropped by with Ayse. Did they come in here? No, no just to the garden. Mom was a bit anxious about how I was doing. I nursed Ayse a bit. Gulnihal, look... Don't take Zeynep out again without asking me. OK I won't... Since the weather was so nice I thought it would be nice for her to get some sun. - Do you have a photo of Ayse? - Yes, of course. Show me, I've been curious about her... Oh, she is really cute. She looks like you. You have the same nose. - We do? - Yes. - Is this your husband? - Yes, Kamil. He is good-looking... - And this must be your mother-in-law... - Yes. She looks quite young... You know we should try baking cakes. Sure... Why not... Oh, why did you take them off? They looked nice on you. Do you like them? They were hurting my ears a bit. Yes, here we are... Yes dear. My girl smells so nice. Lie down... Yes my love... Are your feetsies cold? We should put some oil on you... We have to put oil on you, my love... Hold on, hold on a second. Call your daddy... Call your daddy... What are you doing, my love? She smells so nice, Daddy. Please thank Gulnihal for me... - What for? - The cake is delicious. It's been a while since I had some home-made cake. What are you doing my love? What happened? Nothing... It's nothing... Is that a new bruise? I don't know. It wasn't there in the morning... The one in the middle? Yes, that's the one. There they are. Move in. Zoom in, a little closer? Who is that woman? Her mother-in-law. Look how she's holding her. I got angry when she told me they went out. We are sure about this camera idea, right? Then I suggest that we tell Gulnihal about this... No.. Maybe later... Are we going to pretend that we forgot to tell her? We'll handle it later... If she figures it out, she will quit! Don't say that I didn't warn you! Please sign on the back as well... No, I didn't tell you... I am not an expert when it comes to insurance, Sir. I'll connect you to my colleague in charge.. We are going out for lunch Asli. Do you want to join us? I need to key these files into the system. OK... You want me to get you something? Thanks.. I am going to go out soon anyway.. - See you. - See you later. Looks so delicious... - Yes... - Yes... - Asli, what is this? - What is it? I don't know... Take a look... It's yogurt... Don't tell me you didn't know about it. Gulnihal made it. She just creates new jobs for herself. Can you hand me a bowl? You didn't see her making it? No I didn't. I can't watch what she's doing the whole day. Ayse is doing well. Don't worry. She had a slight fever last night. But she was fine in the morning. Don't worry. What about you? It must be cold out there. I also miss you very much. You be patient. After all, only 10 months left... She stopped nagging me after I started working. Mrs Asli? They are very nice people. The house is great. You just come back and then we will see... This one should fit you, too. How did you meet Kamil? My mother-in-law saw me in Kastamonu... We are distant relatives. They asked for my hand. We stayed engaged for a few months and then got married... It looks very nice on you. You can also use it with the zip up. Do you love each other? Pardon? Do you get on well with each other? Yes, we do. I better get going... I'm getting late... Thank you. Don't forget your phone... What's going on? Open up... One more? The number you're calling is busy now... How's Ayse? Is she better now? OK, is she sleeping? How about you? Zeynep is flying! Hello.. Hello? Excuse me? Hello. I want to increase my credit card's limit. OK, how much? By 500 TL... By 500 TL... Your client number? 6688202. You should immediately receive an sms... What have you done? You've increased the limit by 5000 liras instead of 500 liras. - Excuse me? - Yes? You increased the limit by 5000 liras instead of 500 liras. Oh, sorry, I'll fix it right now. - Thank you. - I'm so sorry. Gulnihal, are you waiting for me? Yes, it's already 6:30... Really?! I wasn't aware of that at all... I called but you didn't pick up. I mute my phone when I'm in the office. I forgot to cancel the mute. How do I look? It looks nice on you. OK then off I go. - Did you buy salt by the way? - No I didn't... I added it to the list on the fridge. Don't ever add anything to that list; just tell me, ok? - OK... Have a nice evening... - You too. - Good morning. - Good morning. Gulnihal, I'm leaving. Call me if you need anything. OK. - Take good care of Zeynep. - OK, have a nice day. Mommy's gone? Come now. What's going on? OK, OK... Here you are... Please read the agreement thoroughly. Fill in the blanks and then please bring it back to me... Hello? Hello... We are fine... I fed Zeynep and put her to sleep. I can't find my earrings, Gulnihal. Your earrings? I might've left them in the living room. I'll look around, if you want, and let you know if I can find them. OK. OK, have a look... Come on; it's time to eat. Come on have some... Why are you doing like this? You haven't eaten anything all day. Here is your food... Oh you're back! I didn't hear you! You were sleeping. I didn't want to wake you up. There's tea; have a cup. You know what happened today? What happened? Zeynep started crawling. Oh, she did? It won't be a surprise if she starts walking soon. How nice... Kids these days start walking right away, even before crawling. How was your bike ride? Where did you go? It was very nice. I rode in the forest... I got some fresh air. I've missed being by myself. Don't you ever miss it? I only miss my mom. Oh, damn it... You leave it sis, I'll take care of it... This was my fault. Take these. Did you hurt your hand? Let me pass... Faruk... Faruk can you have a look? She has fever. - Fever? - Yes... - She doesn't have fever. - Yes, she does! Darling, she doesn't have fever. - Check it with the thermometer. - It's not working... Don't you remember? I've told you several times to get a new one. But you didn't bother. - Sorry. - So, what do we do now? - Now get up and go get one. - How can I find it at this hour? Why does everything we buy have to be electronic? There must be a 24-hour pharmacy around. Ok I'll go, no problem, but she doesn't have fever. But you have a slight fever... - Stop teasing... - I'm not teasing. Check her again. Check me. Now check yourself... - I'm fine! - You don't look fine to me. I'm very fine! The only thing I asked was a thermometer! Still talking about it! Thank you, you shouldn't have bothered. It's nice... You are most welcome... Bon appetite... - Are you knitting this for Kamil? - Yes. It's a nice color... It is, isn't it? I also liked it when I was buying it. Everything is green in the military. So I thought at least this would be a bit different. You want some more? Thanks. This was just what I needed. Thank you. - Hello. - Hello. It seems that this is yours... My colleagues have identified from the surveillance cameras You seem to have misplaced it, so I delivered it... Thank you very much. - Have a good day. - Thank you. Do you like it? Is it pretty? Well... Looks OK. It smells good, too. OK. Now it's time to add these... Give me a hand. OK. Now lets pour this. You pour it, I'll rotate the pan. Oh my! I spilled some. No problem. OK. Yes, let me put this away. Has the oven preheated to 165 degrees? Put it in the oven. I'll be back in a second. Gulnihal, this is for Ayse... A cardigan... I bought an identical one for Zeynep... Oh, you shouldn't have bothered. There was no need for that. Open it, see if you like it... Why don't you bring Ayse one day? Yes, sure. Hello... How are you? I'm also well thank you. There is something I want to ask you. I suddenly realised that my breastmilk is back. So, you are saying it can happen.. What should I do then? OK, I see. So, it will gradually dry up, And there's nothing to worry about. I guess I have been a bit stressed out... OK, I won't worry about it then. Thanks. I've got to go now. Have a nice evening... Thank you very much. - Is the cake done? - I don't know; I haven't checked it. You knew very well how to listen in on my conversation. What are you saying, Sister Asli? So, you didn't hear what I was talking about? What? I haven't heard anything, I swear! Yeah, alright... I believe you... Didn't rise very well. Maybe it'll taste good though. What do you think? Maybe... Do you want me to give you a ride home? It's not necessary. Don't bother; I can go on my own. What are these? Cameras... Take them away. Get rid of them; I don't want them in the house anymore. I need to ask you something. Why did we install these, and why are we taking them out now? What time is it? It's 8.25, Asli, what's going on? What is it? It's nothing... Asli, what's the problem? Is it about Gulnihal? Did she find out about the cameras? No she didn't. Did you argue with her about something? - No we didn't! - Then why are you removing them? I don't want them anymore... I'm here! Where have you been? I was really worried! I hope I'm not late... I'm sorry about last night. I've been a nervous wreck these days. I thought you wouldn't come back... Ayse had a fever last night. But she's better now. Hope she gets well soon. You look like you didn't get much sleep. No, it was a sleepless night. Don't bother with cooking or anything; just get some rest ok? OK... Zeynep is sleeping in her room.
