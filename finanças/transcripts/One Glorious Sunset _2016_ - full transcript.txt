Dehydrated? - There's always water. - We needed a drink! No, you needed the drink, he needed to be at home, safe. Come on, Dad, put this down. - Come on, come on. - No. Let's get you home. (BROODING MUSIC) Don't forget your wages. Oh yeah. Ah, so, how's he been today? Yeah, he's been a bit better. It's been a good day today.

No, I've got to open the shop. Yes, but what am I meant to do? He's relying on me. - Eva can't open... - what the fuck am I meant... Look, will you just please come home? I need you to look after Dad. Yeah, well, I've got fucking responsibilities as well. Jackie. Well, it's me, where are you? Well, I have had to come into shop and open up. Do you realise that?

Oh, good. But his car isn't, mate. Eh, what did you forget to do? You forgot to bleed the cooling system, Sean, is what you forgot to do. How basic is that? Even I know about that. So, now his car's all seized up, and he's taking his business elsewhere. You made me look like a right pillock. Sorry. Yeah, well, you will be, Sean. I'm letting you go. I've gotta let you go, mate, I've had enough. I can't cope with your moods and your drinking. It's just too much, all right, so get out. - Oh, come on. - Leave, go. You give me the right hump, Sean, just get out. I'll sort your money out, and I'll send on to you. You gotta go, go! Leave your jacket on the side. Well, I'm sorry, man. Yeah, so am I, just go.

Oh, Sean, please don't make me, please. I can't put him in a home, you know this. I'm not going over it again with you. Yeah, I realise that, but... I think it's us that's failing him. (TRANQUIL MUSIC) EVA: Hey. JACKIE: So, Sean and I had a chat last night. - Oh, really? - Mm-hmm. I think I am gonna go for that managerial role. Right, well, we need to get you spruced up, then. - Oh, no. - Yes. We need a pamper night. - Oh, no. - Yes, come on. If you're gonna go for that, you gotta look your best. You know, your face back, feet up, I'd do your nails. It's so much fun, come on. - Really? - Get you spruced up, looking like your old self again. Oh, I wish you could come round every week. - Speaking of which. - Oh, yeah, so, he came back about an hour later. Yeah, he starts asking all these questions about you. Were you in a relationship with someone, and did I think you might be interested in going on a date with him, and, like, would I give him your number. Oh, you're kidding. No, seriously. But obviously, I didn't give that to him, but I did take his business card. I feel terrible. - What? - I'm not sure I shut the front door of the shop properly, like, that I locked it. I'm not completely 100% sure. - I'm gonna have to dash. - Eva! Yeah, I'm really sorry. - No! - Yeah. - Sean. - Hi, Eva. Oh, hi, you're off work early. Yeah. Good night? (CHUCKLES) Yeah. We did a bit of a pampering session. Oh, oh, okay. Are they for me? Yeah. Oh, really? SEAN: I bought them for you. What did I do to deserve these? Blimey, I'm being really pampered at the moment. I know, you deserve it. JACKIE: Well, what have I done? You haven't done anything, I haven't anything. No one's done nothing. Honestly, you haven't made a decision yet, have you? I have made a decision, but I think I should tell her first. (CELLPHONE RINGING) Hey, boss. It's nice to know I'm appreciated. Wow, I don't know, manager's position? Yeah. Can I get back to you? - Dad. - I want to see. Where is Spud, for goodness' sake, where is he? Dad, Spud's not coming today. I want to see him. I know. I like him, but I just want to see him. - I know, I know. - Where is he? He said he'd come next week. I don't know what to do. (UPBEAT MUSIC) Have you noticed how much Sean's been drinking every time we see him? Well, actually, now that you've said it. - Yeah. - Oh dear. We had a few too many. ROSIE: Together? INSTRUCTOR: head. And we had a bit of a moment. (GASPS) She doesn't know, does she? No! You're not gonna say anything, right? No, I'm not. Okay, girls, to the poles. Let's do it. Oh, come on. Oh, come on! - What? - Yeah, fluke. So, I've got a bit of a quandary. Oh dear, why, what's up? Boss at work has offered me the manager's job. Oh, congratulations. Yeah, not really. Oh, how come? Jackie really wanted it. I won't wanna be in your shoes right now. I don't know what to do. I want my dinner. But you just had your dinner. - No, I haven't. - You did. You had it 10 minutes ago. - No, I didn't. - You did. Jacket potato. I didn't, I know I didn't have it. Jacket potato, beans, cheese. Where's Spud anyway, where's Spud? Dad, Spud's not coming today. Oh. Now, go and get my dinner. Go on, now. You've already had your dinner. You had it 10 minutes ago. I haven't. I know I haven't. JACKIE: Spud let Dad down again today. - Did he? - How long do you think that's been now? SEAN: About six months. JACKIE: It's just not on, is it? SEAN: I don't know. I haven't seen some of my mates since six months. If the tables were turned, Sean, Dad wouldn't do it to him. It's absolutely disgusting, I'm livid. - Hey. - Hi. As you know, Marjorie's leaving soon, and I have been watching you carefully, and you do make a big effort with the customers, especially over the last few months, so I'd like to offer you the job. Really? I really appreciate it, but I think you should give it to Jackie. I would've preferred to have you, but if it's not to be, it's not to be. ♪ Doodah, doodah ♪ ♪ Doodah, doodah day ♪ ♪ Doodah doodah do ♪ ♪ Do de do da do ♪ JACKIE: So, thanks for the offer of help. EVA: Oh, it's okay. Well, it's a big job, this garden. I'm probably not gonna have that much time in the future. EVA: How come? Mike offered me that manager's role. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Oh, that's amazing, well done! Thank you, I was so surprised. Well, yeah, it's mine. - Congratulations. - Thank you. I'm surprised you didn't go for it, actually. No, not really for me. Really? I think you'd have been quite good at it. I think it suits you better. Oh! (BOTH GIGGLING) Oh, hey, it's Dad's birthday on Sunday, his meal. You haven't forgotten, eh? EVA: No, I'm gonna be there. JACKIE: Good. 'Cause you'll be the light relief if the rubbish would happen. (BROODING MUSIC) SEAN: Right, here we go, bit of red wine for ya. There we go, lovely. Get your laughing gear around that, eh? - Yeah. - Lovely, all right. All right, another one for you there. Dad? (DOORBELL RINGING) - Hello! - Hi, hi! Oh, thank you for coming. - He's over here. - Oh, there he is. - Birthday boy. - Dad? EVA: Happy birthday, Bob. - Dad? - Bob? - Hmm? - Hello. Dad, it's Eva. She's come to wish you happy birthday. Happy birthday, mwah. - I think... - Yeah, that's it. You can do it. Okay, so. Down there. Yeah! ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday, dear Dad ♪ ♪ Happy birthday, dear Bob ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ JACKIE: Yay! EVA: You've still got it. You feeling a bit tired? Oh, let's sit you down. Sean's outside, if you wanna go and grab a drink, or give him a hand. Hey, Sean. Oh, Eva. (CLEARS THROAT) Do you want a drink? Yeah, just some wine. All right. You know what happens when we drink together. Maybe a bit more. Yeah. Just, we've had too much. Help yourself to a samosa. Not too many, mind. It gives you havoc on your bowels. (EVA LAUGHS) Hello, surprise! Oh my god, Rosie! What are you doing here? I had to come back to get the rest of my stuff, so I thought I'd time it in for Robert's birthday, so I could be here. - How kind of you. - Oh, it's okay. How's he doing? Not so good. But he'll be delighted - to see you. - I'll go say hello. Dad. Hey, Robert. Hmm? How's it going, happy birthday. Mwah, how you feeling? Okay? Oh. (BROODING MUSIC) Shit party, ain't it? Bit like our lives, isn't it? I'm so sorry, Rosie. I know I should've told you, but, I just didn't want to accept how bad he'd got. ROSIE: I just, I don't understand what happened. Well, the doctor says that he's having hundreds of tiny strokes all the time. When things start to go wrong in the brain, you just can't tell how it's gonna affect them. I was just so shocked, 'cause he just, he didn't recognise me. I'm sorry. Hey, it's okay. It's just, there's hundreds of tiny strokes, and each, each one is taking a little bit of of my dad away. I'm sorry. Here's to Dad, eh? Cheers, to Robert. Or what's left of him. Hey, Spud. Hey, look, Bob, Spud. Happy birthday, Robert, I made this for your birthday. That's kind, isn't it? Go on, well, take it. Get yourself a drink, Spud. You used to work up in the mountains. Yeah, of course it is, look. Look at the shape. He got you this as well, it's the shape of Tenerife. You used to work up in the mountains. I'm gonna miss you, yeah. Look after yourself. Okay. (MELANCHOLY MUSIC) You know, sometimes I really hate myself for thinking about... I wish he were dead. I mean, I don't actually mean I wish he were dead, but, if he were to die, then... I just wish he could do it with some more dignity than this. Yeah, yeah, I know what you mean, yeah. I couldn't stand the looks he was getting today, Sean. I couldn't bear it. Come on, we're used to it. Yeah. Yeah, I know, but I just felt so ashamed of him. I don't wanna feel ashamed of him. Jackie, we gotta remember him as we used to. You know, Big Rob, the Robmeister, Glampost. (LAUGHS) You know? Yeah. I know. But he's just... It's just, I don't know, I want people to remember him like that. And they're just gonna remember him like he is now. He looks like Dad, and he sounds just like Dad, but how much of him is there, Sean? I can't bear it. What would he do? Say, if I was Robert, right? The smart and healthy Robert. We're getting to five years now. What would he do? (MELANCHOLY MUSIC) He was too proud. He was too proud to go like this. He'd hate it. He'd go up to the mountains, wouldn't he? Yeah. Seatbelt, Dad, seatbelt. For God's sake. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) In a minute, Dad. No, now. (UPBEAT MUSIC) I need to wee.
