Now, Jo Ann. Now, Class, be quiet. Shh. Class! - Well, why'd you let them take me away? - I couldn't help it, Bobby. They was all bigger than me. - I hate it there. - So do I.

Don't run off! Ain't nobody here gonna hurt ya! Come on back! Come inside! - You all right? - I guess. - Were you out here all night? - Yessum. - You listen to your grandma now. You gotta stay clear of your grandpa for awhile. You do that, and things will get better, I promise. - Am I gonna have to sleep out here all night? - No, hun. I'll get that worked out, but you gotta help me. You gotta be on your best behavior, all right? - All right. Grandma, how come Grandpa hates me so much? - Oh, he don't hate ya, little bug. He's just got a bad tamper. It won't last. You do as I say, and we'll all be fine. - Thanks for breakfast. - Our secret. Now, on the way home from school, I want you to stop by the preacher's house, and get a dozen eggs from his wife. Okay. ♪ Kokomo ♪ - Hello, little Foley. - Grandma sent me for a dozen eggs. - That right? Does she know she hadn't paid me for the last three dozen she got? - If I go back with no eggs- - You'll get a whoopin'. - Yes, ma'am. - You like flowers? - I do. - Flowers is how God laughs. - Really? - It's true. I'll get the eggs for ya, and you pick a flower, take it with ya. - Thank you, ma'am. - Oh, those are real nice eggs, and a flower too. Is they for me? - Well, I took some tomatoes from your garden last night, and I'm sorry. I wanted to pay you back. - Oh, ain't no need for that. Come on inside, and we'll make somethin' real nice for us to eat. It's all right, sit down. Sit on down. We gonna make us somethin' good out these eggs. I'm not hungry. - Well, you look hungry. - If I tell people I'm hungry, I'll get in trouble. - Well, you don't have to tell me you're hungry, just tell me how much you like the biscuits. Now... Now, tale this right here, and I want you to stir this till it's nice and smooth. Oh, no, darlin'. No, wait, sweetheart. No, sweetheart. You got to hold the bowl in one hand, and take the spoon in the other hand. You don't have to stir hard, just make it nice and smooth. See how smooth it's gettin'? You're doin' a good job there. - Well! Looks like we got us a guest. - That's right! - We're makin' biscuits. You are? - Come on in, Too Tall. We gonna have us a tea party. - Oh, sounds good to me. You's a good cook, huh, baby? When you and your momma goin' to Kokomo? - Oh, I think pretty soon. - Well, I reckon you won't mind goin'? - I reckon not. - Well, now, listen to me baby. When you get there, I want you to remember to listen and learn. Listen to everything. You got good, sharp ears, so you ain't gonna have no trouble at all teachin' yourself to learn. You just listen and learn from everything you see. And if you got a problem, you talk to somebody got some sense, and then you think about it. You think about it, and you decide what you wanna do. It's best to make your own mistakes in this life, because then, if you do make a mess, it's your mess. You understand what I'm saying to you? Come on, let's go in the house. They're telling you lies about me, Karl! - No, I heard it from fellas in the barracks that I trust. - You'd believe anybody before you'd believe me. - But this is no joke, Marie! - You don't understand. This is real trouble! - No, please! Please don't go. Please believe me before you believe them! - I tried to shut my eyes to a lot, Marie. I wanted to take you away from all this. I tried to convince myself that it was only your family that was trash, but the truth is, you're no different! - Then go! Go, damn you! Get out! You think you're the only man in the world? - No, that's the trouble, Marie. I know I'm not. And I know you take money to do what you're supposed to do for love. - Yeah, what do you know about love? You talk about it real good, but you don't know anything! Get out! Fine. - Don't worry about him, Jo Ann. - I liked him. You can't like nobody like him. He sees somethin' wrong in everything. He don't care how people gotta get by! He just cares how it looks. Well, survivin' ain't always pretty, no matter how much makeup you put on it. - Guess we ain't goin' to Kokomo? - Nope, I reckon we ain't. - So you ain't goin' to Kokomo, huh? Well, that ain't the worst thing. What letter's that? - A "B"? - Right. Now, you make it. Very good! Now, you see how easy that is? - Out here it's easy, but in school with everybody watchin', expecting you to get it wrong, I forget. - Well, the next time, you take that piece of chalk just like it's this stick, and you look at that blackboard just like it's this dirt, and you think about old Honey, and you'll get it, because you's right smart. I can tell that about you. You's right smart! Yeah, she is too. - Jo Ann? Class! Now, we are all here to learn. Now, we need to do what we can to help Jo Ann. Go ahead. - Are you goin' to The Joint? - Well, now, just 'cause I've put on makeup don't mean I'm goin' to The Joint. - Ain't makeup what you put on before you're goin' out to have a good time? - I ain't doin' nothin' bad, if that's what you're worried about. - If it ain't bad, then why can't you tell me? - 'Cause what I do outside this house belongs to me, just to me. It's like I ain't a Foley anymore. I pretend I've got a big, fine house and shiny, new car. That's the life I want. And I go out, and I live it, even if it's just for a little while. It's like a secret. Don't you got a secret? - Maybe. - Jo Ann, you've got a secret? - No, Mama. - Won't be long before you'll be goin' with them. - Says who? - Says Pa. - So it don't mean nothin'. - Nothin' but money. I saw you sneaking back the junk man's farm. - No, you didn't. - Yeah, I did, and I'm gonna tell Pa. - I'll say it's a lie. - He'll believe me before you. - Bobby, please don't tell him. - What will you give me if I don't? - I'll give you money. - You ain't got no money. - Yes, I do. Just promise! - Go and get your money. - Promise? - I promise. - Remember, you promised. For now. Listen, don't you hear 'em calling? Who? These tomatoes is talkin' to us. What are they sayin', Honey? - They sayin', we's ready. Come on and get us. They sayin', where's that little gal and that old man that been waitin' and watchin' for us, so they can pick us? Well, we's ripe, why don't they come on and pick us? - But don't it hurt 'em, Honey, to be picked up and eaten like that? No, child. That's they place in this world. You see, God made 'em to be eat up. He made 'em to be food for his children. You see, everything God makes has a place and a time. You see, that's why we has to use up all the stuff he done sent us, you see? Mm-hmm, sure as God makes you, he got a job in mind for you. Don't even bother if he don't, 'cause God don't like no waste, and he don't like no wastefulness. Makes him sad. Makes him cry like a baby. - God cries? - Oh, sure he does, child. Ain't nothin' wrong with a few tears. Sometimes... Sometimes them tears, they help pass the pain away. - Get off! Stop! - Say, "Uncle", white trash! - I is no white trash. - Get off of him! Who you callin' white trash? - Nobody! Say you're sorry! - All right, all right, nobody's white trash! - Say you're sorry like you mean it! Ow! I'm sorry! - Bobby? - Now, I told you look out for Bobby. - I did. - Then how'd he get a black eye? - It wasn't my fault, Grandpa! The bully was whoopin' him before I got there, and then I laid into him. - Is that right? - I whooped the stuffin' out of him. Just ask Bobby. - Did you make him cry? - Almost. - Well, you're a tough little squirt, aint ya? - I'm a Foley. - Well, that's right, you are, and you proved it today, didn't ya? Good for you, Jo Ann. Good for you. I'm thinkin' of goin' down to the river later, do some fishin'. You wanna come along? - Sure. - What about me? - Well, you can stay here with the women folk. Here, let me. - It's squirming. - I know. That's what makes 'em so delicious to the fish, I mean. - Grandpa, how long have you been comin' down here to go fishin'? - Oh, lordy, since I was as young as you, I guess. - You were little like me? - Well, it's hard to believe, I know, but your grandpa was always a crooked leg moonshiner. There was a day, a day when the world was at my feet. I could have been anything. Foleys were respected in this county. It's true. And Papa died, and I had my accident at the cotton gin, and things went bad after that. - But it'll get better. - You sound like your grandma. She's made me believe it too. But the older you get, the more you realize, that day came and went. Now, don't just sit there. If you're gonna fish, fish. - Now, I ain't got time to keep turnin' this rope when you ain't even jumping. - Look, Honey, don't hurry me. I have to get this just right. - Don't make the girl do what she don't wanna do, Honey. - Will you butt out of this, Two Tall? - It's no so easy to butt out when I'm sittin' right here watchin'. - Now, Jo Ann, this rope is all your troubles, and they gonna keep comin' around, so you gonna to have to learn how to jump over 'em, so they won't trip you. Now, come on, you gotta do it! A man's gotta help himself. - We gotta help ourselves too, Honey. Us women. Child, we's all the same in God's eyes, men and womens. - Girls too, Honey? Girls to. - Cows too, Honey? Yes, cows too. - Roosters too? - Yeah, roosters too. I'm scared of your rooster. - Oh, he ain't nothin' but some old fluff and feathers. Look how she jumpin', Too Tall. And you told me, "Don't make her do somethin' she don't wanna do". Sometimes I'd like to put a stamp on your butt, and mail you off somewhere, but where would we find a box big enough to fit him in? Help me! Yeah. - You old rooster, do you hear me? You scare this child, you gonna end up in my stew pot, and I ain't playin'. Now, these hens may be bowin' down to ya, but you mess with this child, you'll be sittin' on my dinner table. He ain't gonna bother you. Honey! Dammit, Honey, you scared me! Wait! He tried to kill me! - Oh, baby. - Honey, you lied to me! You said it was fine! - Oh, I'm just gonna hold you until the bad comes outta you. - Let go of me! - Help us, Father. - Let go! Let go of me. He's trying to kill me. Why didn't you protect me, Honey? Oh, my baby. You my baby. I ain't gonna let nothin' happen to you. That rooster wants to kill me, Honey. What am I supposed to do about that? - Now, listen. Now, you just don't look him in the eye. You act like he ain't even there. - But he's there. He's there all the time. - What? Who? Who's there all the time, baby? Tell Honey. Who? You feeling all right, baby? - Yeah. - Now, you just remember, ain't nothing gonna happen to you as long as Honey's here, and don't you forget it. - No, I won't. You always make things better, Honey. - I'm glad, baby. - You're the nicest nigger I met. - You better go on now. - What? What's wrong? - Just go on! Your folks are waitin' on you! Go on! - Honey, what's wrong? - Just go home! But I... - What's the matter? - I must be outta my mind. I can't help no white girl just wanders up the road. - Jo Ann? - I don't want her in here no more, you hear me? Honey? - I don't want her in here no more! Too Tall, give me a pin. - Where are they? They're right there. I'll try. Right where? - There, there, right there! I declare, you must be blind. - What's the matter? - Nothin, except you useless. What? - You're thinking about Jo Ann. - I can't get her off my mind. - There may be things you can't change no matter how hard you try. The well's she gotta draw from is polluted. The Foleys, they used to control this whole county. Now, look at 'em. Something's wrong over there. Somethin' bad. - I know it ain't right, that's what got me worried about her. She ain't got nobody but me, and if I turn away from her, what's she gonna do then? - There's gonna come a time when you won't be there to rescue her. She gonna have to do it all by herself. - Are you still mad at me? - I ain't mad at ya, child. - But the other day, I said somethin' that made you mad? - You hurt me. - How did I hurt you? I didn't hit you or scratch you. - You called me a nigger. - So? - That word... That word is used to hurt folk like me. There's a lot of words that folk use to hurt ya. If you remembers, you, yourself, got in a fight at school, 'cause somebody called Bobby white trash. Them words hurt you, didn't they? - Yeah. - That's what I mean. - I didn't wanna hurt you, Honey. I wanted to make you feel good. - I figured as much, but it still hurt. - I'm sorry. I won't ever do it again. I promise. - I believe you, child. Don't worry. We's is still good friends. - I want you to get Jo Ann ready. She's goin' with us. - She'll be 14 in a week. Can't it wait? - No, it can't. We've been feeding her for 14 years, her turn to give a little. And Bobby's goin' too. - Another generation of the Foley's. - That's right! Learnin' the family business. Not a thing wrong with it. - I ain't never been out of the county before, - Yeah, well, Bristol ain't much. - That'll be your first lesson. Never try nothing in your own backyard where they know ya. - What is it exactly we're gonna do? - Oh, you'll see, son. You'll see. Okay, Bobby, you come with me.

Well, well, look at what we got here. - Ma'am. - Ma'am. - Now, Jo Ann, you stay here. I'm gonna send some boys out to have a look at ya. You don't let 'em touch you now, you hear? Okay? ♪ Early in the morning ♪ ♪ I haven't slept at all ♪ ♪ I've been sittin' on a barstool ♪ We was just about drinkin' all day. - Hi. - Hi. - So what you doin' out here all alone? - I was about to ask you the same thing. - I'm too young to go in. - Yeah, I can see that now. - And you? - Well, I drove some friends here. We're all waitin' to get shipped out, and some of us needed to blow off some steam. They get a little drunk, and I get 'em home. - You're a good friend. I think that that's about the most important thing a person can be. - You do? What makes you think that? Well... Oh. - What's the matter? - Just pretend like I'm not here. - Hey, soldier? I'm lookin' Jo Ann. Know her? - No, sir. - You're a fine boy, doing duty and all. Keep it up. Jo Ann!

To the graduation? - You want me to come? - Yeah. Sure, I'll be there. I wish things would have been different, Jo Ann, but, well, they ain't. - Look at her. Over there. And the Composition Award goes to Miss Jo Ann Foley. Congratulations, Jo Ann. - How'd it go? Is that your award? Sorry I couldn't come. Somethin' came up. Now, don't get all in a mood. I made you that dress, didn't I? So you'd be the prettiest girl in school. - You said you'd be there, but you lied, just like you always lie. I ain't never seen nothin' like it. You are some kinda smart girl! - And it all started with letters in the dirt out by the chicken coop. That's right. - Well, we got a little somethin' for ya. What is it? - A surprise. Let me see! Come on! - Hmm? Let me see! Let me see! - Here. - Oh, Honey! I knew'd it! I knew you was gonna make that apron for me! Oh, and look at these flowers, and these pockets.

And look a there, look a there. Too Tall done put a peg up there for you. Go on. Thank you, Too Tall. - No problem, no problem. I'm gonna keep my apron right here. - Till you get a home of your own. - I wished that this was my home. - Baby. Well, come on, y'all. We gotta go. We don't wanna be late.

Take a good look inside. Now, that is a man that understands suffering! That is a man, that in his last days on Earth, felt abandoned by everybody, even God himself! Praise the Lord. - My God... My God, why hast thou forsaken me? Now, I don't know about you, but I've said that a few times. - Praise God! - Amen! - Said that, and a whole lot more. Daddy! Daddy! - Daddy! - Daddy! - It'll be all right, yes, uh-huh. I'll shoot you. Come over here, old girl. - You liked that music this morning, huh? - I sure did. - Let me show you somethin'. What's this? - It's a hymnal. Every song we sang this morning is in this here book. - Even "Rock of Ages"? - Page 32. - That's right. - Mm-hmm. - You already know now how to figure out the words, and if you's a good girl, maybe Miss Evelyn here will teach you how to read the notes. - You'd do that? - Surely. - 'Cause every woman needs a song in her heart... And an apron in her kitchen. That's right! - Now I got the song and the apron. - Jo Ann, why don't you run outside and see how Two Tall's doing with that barbecue? All right. She's somethin' else, ain't she? Mmm, she sure is. Thank you. You're awful attached to her. Well, now, that's the truth. - You think that's such a good idea? - What do you mean? - I know it's been tough on you all these years since you lost the baby, but don't you think you should think this through a little more? - Losin' my baby in childbirth didn't have nothin' to do with Jo Ann! - I don't mean to rile ya. - I ain't riled! - But she's white. And a Foley on top of that. - You think I don't know that? - I'm sure you do. But sooner or later, there's gonna be a price to pay for you takin' her in like this, and it'll be high. It's for you. - Grandpa. - Put it on. We're going to The Joint. - Where's Mama? - We don't need your mama. - I don't want to. - Oh, come on. It'll be fun. Just you and me. I'll teach you to play pool. - I don't like The Joint, Grandpa, and I don't wanna go there. - Now, I bought the dress. I spent good money! - I like it. It's nice, but I- - Don't backtalk me! Now, put it on, and let's go. - I won't! - Don't raise your voice to me! Get back here! Think you're better than me, do ya? Huh? No! Ow! Ow. Jo Ann! Stay away from me! - Honey got a crush on that quartet, boy! Believe me. - Just hush up, Too Tall. Honey! Honey! Wait one minute. Did you hear somethin'? - Honey. Honey! - I did hear somethin'. Honey! Honey! - Oh, look what they done to my baby! Oh, honey. Oh, my darlin'. It's like you ain't payin' no attention at all. Just drop a child anywhere. Oh, darlin'. This is it. This is all of it. We got to take her away from them. I ain't gonna let them keep beatin' this child like this! I ain't gonna stand for it! I just ain't gonna stand for it! Oh, my. I ain't gonna take that child back. - They're trash! And that's the truth of it! - But they're white. - That don't make 'em right. - But it does. You know that you! - You try and keep that child, they're gonna take everything you have, everything you ever worked for. - You could start trouble for all of us. - Y'all thinkin' about yourselves. You ain't thinkin' about the child. - We have to think about everybody. Now, what's it gonna mean when a poor black woman go into a courtroom with a white child, and say, "I know better than her folks". "I'm gonna keep her." - They don't even want that child! - And they never did! We are the ones who love her! - You're gonna set white against black in this county. That little girl's gonna be in the center, and she is gonna get torn to pieces. - I think Dr. Joe is telling us that we'd do more good staying in the background and helping her when we can. - And we'll be standing in the back when they lower her in her grave, Too Tall. - Honey, it's the only choice that we have. - I can't send her back! - Honey. - I can't send her back! - Honey, Honey! Honey. - You have such a pretty voice. - Oh, I'm sorry, baby. I didn't mean to wake you up. - Will you teach me to sing like that? - I surely will. - You look sad. - Some things even old Honey can't make better. - Like what? - I got to take you back to them wicked folks of yours for the second time. - What do you mean? - Did you ever wonder where that little cross you wear really came from? Yeah. - When you was born, I heard you cryin'. And then I seen him lay somethin' down by the side of the road. Too Tall didn't want me stickin' my nose in it, but I knew somethin' was wrong. I can't tell you what happened when I looked in that sack. You was lookin' at me just like you knowed me, and my heart burst open, and the stars fell out. I didn't know what to do with you, so I took you home, and that's when I gave you that little cross, and I gave you a bath, and I wrapped you up. And Too Tall, he just worried me talkin' 'bout, you can't keep her! You can't keep her! He was right then, and he's right now. I'm gonna have to take you back. - But what if I don't wanna go back? - Oh, baby, we don't get no choice. You stay out here, sooner or later, somebody gonna come out here and bring Too Tall and me a mess of trouble. I gotta take you back. But this time, we gotta be smarter than your grandpa. You think we can do that? - Sure. - We may not have his strength, but we got the brains to beat him, baby. We can beat him. We can beat it. We're just gonna see about this. I'm not gonna let him do you like this. We gonna fix this now! - Well, well. - What happened? - I found this child wanderin' around in the woods. She says she belongs here. Somethin' bad done happened to her, but she won't say what it is. - Come on in the house, Jo Ann. We'll fix you up. - Must be some kind of a vicious animal to treat a child like this! - Thank you for your kindness. - Least I could do. - I'm glad that you've been there. - It's a shame! It's a dirty shame what you're doing to that child! - Now, that is enough, nigga woman! You get along now! - Yes, sir, Mr. Hank Foley! Look like to me, you done had some of that same stuff that happened to that girl. I bet the sheriff find that pretty peculiar. - I don't think the sheriff would believe a thing you say, nigger woman. - Well, I'm just an old woman. But when you live long as me, you sees things, like a man layin' a newborn baby by the side of the road in the middle of the night! It's a thing you'll never forget! And I tell ya somethin' else, Mr. Hank Foley. I ain't gonna be still, and let no more babies be hurt no more! He done made me mad, now, Lord. He's mean. He's evil spirited. He just beat that child. I know vengeance is yours, but when are you gonna start? - I'm sorry, Jo Ann. I'm really sorry. - Did Grandpa take me the night I was born? - When you come out of me, Mama was real happy for a second. She said, "It's a girl, it's a girl!" And then he come in. When you come home, I swore I wouldn't let nothin' else happen to you in the world, but I messed up. I messed up many times. You're better off without me. You're better off with that junk nigger woman. - Her name's Honey. - Honey, that's a nice name. - She's gonna teach me how to sing. - Is that right? Well, you get some sleep now. It's been a hard day. Whatever I want. - Come on. - Come on, baby. Gotcha! Come on! - Son of a bitch! You can't leave, Hank. What am I gonna do? Who's gonna run the business? Well, Bobby would have to. And Marie goes too? There's no other way. If we can get across the state line, everything will be all right. Just give me some money. Get the money! Give her some too. Why? We can't travel together. That's exactly what they'll be lookin' for! - Well, you can't leave us empty handed. You'll look after Jo Ann, won't ya? Surely. Lord have mercy, this is bad. - Mama, are you leaving? Hush, I got no choice. - Well, can't I come with ya? - No, it's too dangerous. I'll send for you as soon as I can. - How? - Jo Ann, don't worry about every little thing. I'll go to New York. I'll get a job there sewin'. They pay really good there. Maybe I'll get married. But I'll send for you as soon as I can, I promise. - But Mama, what am I gonna do? - Bobby will be taking you to The Joint or some other places, and you act like you like those men. There's no harm in that. Some of 'em are really nice. - But Mama, I can't! - Yes, you can! That's just the way it is, Jo Ann! - Yeah, well maybe for you, but not for me. - Jo Ann, you do what you're told, and everything will turn out all right. - Has everything turned out all right for you? I hope I never see you again! Ever! Mmm, mmm, mmm, sure do smell good. I might've baked 'em too long. - I'll be sure to let you know if that's the case. - What's the matter, child? Why you cloud up like that all of a sudden? - My mama took off. - Well, why didn't you tell us about it right off? - You know how she is, Honey? She talk when she get ready to talk, and not a second before. - It's gonna get worse over there. I have to make the money my mama would've made. - Well, what if you just don't go? Don't go to The Joint. - I guess I could try that for a while. Grandma and Bobby are already losin' patience with me. We got no other way to make money. - Well, what if you hide out over here with us? - They'd find me. They always find me. I just can't get away from those Foleys. - I hate to say this, but what kind of mother would leave her child in the middle of all that? - Now, you just wait a minute, Too Tall. Her mama tried. Her mama was in the middle of that mess over there too, you know? - I'll never been that kind of mother. - What kind of mother are you gonna be, little darling? I'm gonna be a mother just like you've been to me, Honey. And I'd be just like you. - Let's eat this biscuits now. We don't want 'em to get cold. - Where is she? - She says she ain't comin'. - He's waitin' for you. - I'm not going, Grandma. - You gotta understand somethin'. Sometimes a woman's gotta do things she doesn't like in order to get by, in order to make it to the next day, because tomorrow, the thing you've been waitin' your whole life for may happen. But if you don't make it through today, then tomorrow won't be there. - But I don't want to. - I'm not giving you a choice, Jo Ann. If you don't go, we don't eat. - Isn't there anything else we can do? - If there was, don't you think we would have done it by now? - That's right. - Like you said, Pa. ♪ Too many women ♪ ♪ So little time ♪ - Yeah. ♪ I'm still tryin' ♪ ♪ To meet someone new ♪ - Now, just do as I say. - Right. ♪ Sometimes I meet them at the dance hall ♪ - Hey!

You got to be pretty, but you knows that thing, don't you, baby? - But Honey, what if the Lord reaches down, and takes you and Too Tall from me before I can come back? - Well, if that'd be the case, I will just sit down on the banks of the River of Jordan, and I will tell Peter, I can't go, 'cause I got to wait on that little child that ain't here yet. - It'll be all right, Honey. You'll see. Now, don't you cry, because I love you. I love you all to pieces, Honey. - Baby?

I can't believe you never told me any of this. - You never asked. I never saw much point of it until now. You said something earlier about someone you know, someone who has less than you have. - You heard that? - You need to know, that everything that you have, everything that you enjoy, was built on the hard work of the people who lived here.
