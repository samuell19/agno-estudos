LEE Soon-jae YOON So-Jung SONG Jae-ho KIM Su-mi You there. Did you fall because of me? No, right? Are you hurt? No. I'm talking to you! I asked you if you were hurt! Don't make me repeat myself! - I'm fine - Don't mumble! Is he deaf? Speak up! I'm not hurt! You can go! You're really okay? Don't blame me later on. - You got it? - Okay. You got it? Yes! Goddamn motorcycle. Piece of junk. I shouldn't have stopped. Damn it. Now I have to drag it up. Excuse me. Excuse me! What are you calling me for? I'd like to buy some milk. Is a dollar enough? Look here. Are you trying to repay me or something? I don't need your money. Forget about it. You don't have to yell at me. I've seen you around in the mornings. Take it. It's leftover anyway. Why are you out in this weather? Those scraps aren't even worth much. You don't have a family to support you? No. What? - I said I don't. - Sheesh. What are you doing? You want to break your hip? The snow will freeze up soon. Why is thing so heavy? Grab the back! Oh my! Damn back. Are you all right? No, I'm not. I almost threw out my back. Take care. Drive safe. Just worry about yourself. Oh my! It's nothing. I'm fine, so go on! Sheesh. Shucks, that was embarrassing. LATE BLOSSOM Get rid of that piece of junk, Gramps. Did you just call me a piece of junk? Put your hearing aid on! This old hearing aid is dying out on me. Deok-bae. Is there someone who takes these? Of course. This is worth money too. Do you have to give it to them? What do you need it for? Can you give it to someone else or not? Of course not. It's a matter of loyalty. Deok-bae. Don't take your time and just say it. There's a new parlor across the street. What about it? Wonder where you got the money to spend there every night. Gramps! - Deok-bae. - Yes? Yes, Father! - Why are you so jumpy? - I'm not jumpy. Watch the store. Going somewhere? Have a nice day. I'll watch the store! Good morning. - Is Dal-suis running late? - Seems so. I see. It's getting bright now. Should've been here by now. It's cold. Why don't you wait inside? I'm late. It's morning now. Why am I worrying about it? Shucks. Give me one carton, Gramps. But what if she breaks a hip? - Gramps, I want to buy milk! - Is that why she's not here? - What is he mumbling about? - No, that's absurd. Grandpa! Milk, please! Milk! Crazy bastard. Excuse me? I've got no milk for you! No milk! Annoying little punk! Who does he think he is? Just looking at you makes me sick. Why was he yelling at me? Sheesh. Be careful. Have a nice day. Hello. Hello, sir! Oh! You're late today. - Yes, it ended up that way. - You don't have to shout! - You have your hearing aid! - Don't shout now. I don't wear it when I'm riding, since it's so loud. I see. And who might you be? He's the manager of the parking lot. Mr. JANG Kun-bong. Nice to meet you. Well, I have deliveries to make. What a racket. It is. Thanks to that motorcycle, I'm never late. - You wanted an alarm clock, right? - You have one? I put some rice cakes in there for your wife. See you tomorrow. Dal-su! - Thanks again. - It's just a piece of junk. Honey. Remember to use the bedpan next time. Okay? Say "ah". Good. Chew it well. What did you do today? Tell me. I made stew with noodles for lunch today. Ordering in is easier, but I had nothing better to do. Dal-su from the junkyard gave me an alarm clock... I'll get three hours of sleep. That's strange. Why isn't the parking lot open yet? I'm not sure. He's never been late before. My goodness! I'm late! He didn't look. It's cold. So cold. Grandpa. Let's get some sleep on a Sunday. It's just habit. I can't help waking up. Then go for a walk or something. You want to go? Sheesh. I apologize. Have a nice day. I apologize again. Could I ask you a favor? Please go to my house and lock the front gate. Take your shoes off inside the house! My, my... She's gone senile. Don't eat that dirt! She's completely lost her mind. Sheesh. Isn't there a guardian here? Anyone looking for a senile old woman? - Huh? - Huh! - It's freezing! - Freezing! Jesus, it's freezing. - What's your home number? - Jesus. Freezing. Darn it. Doesn't know her name or her address. Darn it. I'm going to freeze to death. What are you doing, old hag? Your hair is all white. Of course it is, at this age. Don't grow old, dear. You can't get old. Don't grow old, darling. Goddamn it. What did you do today? Tell me. Tell me what you did. Stop pulling! Tell me! She's driving me crazy. - Hurry up. Tell me. - All right. Well... This morning... I couldn't sleep, so I was watching TV. Then Yuna comes and... - Yuna is my granddaughter. - I know. Excuse me? Is anyone home? Hello? What? The front gate was open? Honey! Honey! - Again. - What do you mean, again? I came out to the park and now I'm stuck with you. - Start again from park. - Sheesh. I went for a walk in Siberia and got stuck with a senile granny. She took my clothes and shoes and I'm freezing now. The end. This old fart has lost his mind. How could you go to Siberia? Are you thinking clearly now? - You know what Siberia is? - Of course I do. It's two stops away on the 105 bus. - Gosh darn it. - Gosh darn it. You really don't know where you live? - Where did you come from? - Goodness gracious! Over there. Can you find it if we go there? What am I even asking you for? That tickles! - Shush. - Shush! The kids are inside, so wait out here. - You got it? - Okay. Why do I bother? - Stay here. - Okay. So cold. Yay! That looks fun! - Follow me! - Should I push? Hurry up! This is fun! Wasn't that Gramps? Hi! You'll get sick running around like that. We should call the police first. I'll call the police. Go check the streets. Right. Hey! - I parked here just yesterday! - Yes, I know... But no one's here right now. - Come back later. - You've got to be kidding. Hey. Do you even know who I am? Shit, that's hot! You little punk. Who are you? That's none of your business. Why does everyone here look like shit? You've got shit on your face. That's no way to talk to a stranger. We' re not strangers now. Bam! You flinched, asshole. What? You want a piece of this? Can you see it? Try to see my fist, asshole! Goddamn... Use words, sir. - Get your car out, punk. - Yes, sir. You said it was around here. Over by that telephone pole. We've been there dozens of times. What the hell are you laughing for? I'm working my butt off here. What? Don't glare at me. All you do is swear, fucking old fart. What did you just say to me? What did you say? Get off. Go take a cab. - Cabs are expensive. - Then take the bus! Get off! No! What? That's how you want to do this? Fine. - Get off. - No. Get off! Wait. Honey... I'm not your honey. Boo... Boo what? Poo... Poop? - I'm pooping. - Jesus Christ! - What am I supposed to do? - It's coming out. No, don't! Hold it in for a minute. My goodness. One already came out. Just hold it in. Okay? Pee-pee! She has Alzheimer's, so she couldn't have gone far. Please find her. Thank you so much... What's taking so long? Are you done yet? We'll both freeze to death! Granny! You better not be eating it like you ate that dirt! Why aren't you answering me? Granny. See the toilet paper? Wipe with that! Don't get poop on your clothes! - Excuse me. - Excuse what? Just hurry up and poop. What are you doing? I'm just... Hey! Give me back my umbrella, you thief! Damn it. Sheesh. Honey! Honey! Can you hear me? Honey! Where are you? Honey! Honey! Where were you? Where did you go? Are you all right? Aren't you cold? Are you okay? - Where were you? - I'm sorry. Are you okay? - I'm cold. - Let's get you home. - What took you so long? - Were you scared? - I want to go home. It's cold. - Let's go home. We'll get you warmed up. - I'm hungry. - Okay. - Thank you so much! - Shucks. You don't need to thank me. Hurry and get her home. Thank you. Thank you so much. That's how I wanted to grow old. I'm KIM Man-seok. What's your name? - I'm SONG. - What's your first name? I don't have one. You don't have a name? My father was drafted into the military. Mother waited for him to come back and name me. People began calling me by my last name, and I was called SONG ever since. I came from a small town in the countryside. Deep in the mountains in Kangwon Province. We'll be set once we get to Seoul. Just trust me. Mom... I'll come back with lots of money. We thought we would make it in Seoul. But there were many people and not enough jobs. He slowly changed, but I stood by him. I'm good at sticking it through. We eventually had a daughter, and he left to go and make some money. That was the last time I saw him. My child's body began to burn up. Doctor! I carried her in my arms and ran all around town... Save my baby! But... Since then, I don't think I've ever been happy. I'm being punished. For breaking my mother's heart. You want me to read this for you? I don't know how to read. I see. Have a seat. "To SONG"... To SONG. They say that fate works in mysterious ways. You and I walk the same road every single morning. Some would even call that fate. But we still don't know each... - Going somewhere? - Just out. - What about dinner? - No thanks. - But it's you r favorite stew. - Skipping one meal won't kill me. Out of the way! - It's time for dinner. - I don't want any. - I made mushroom stew. - To hell with the mushrooms. - You' re not eating? - No! I'm goddamn sick of mushroom stew. I'll be waiting at the hill where we always cross. "Around six o'clock"... Goodness. - It's already past eight. - I should leave. Wait... You forgot your letter! Am I being stood up? Even if she doesn't like me... That granny... She could at least come and tell me in person. I would've had dinner if I had known. Mushroom stew... Oh! Why, if it isn't SONG! I'm sorry. - Did you wait long? - Not at all. I thought maybe something came up, so I just had dinner with a friend. - Did you just get here? - Yes. The truth is... I don't know how to read. You can't read? No. I told you, I just ate dinner. Your nose is running. Gosh darn it. I waited for three hours. You happy now? Let's go. As long as I saw you. Button up. It's cold. You know how to tell time, right? I'll see you then. You look pretty. There's a seat. It looks expensive. Let's go somewhere else. How expensive could it possibly be? Why is it so expensive here? I didn't bring you out to eat this crap. Just try it. This crap is surprisingly good. Watch the road. This is the real deal. You don't drink milk, right? No, I'm going to drink it. Weren't you lactose intolerant? I'll be fine if I drink a little at a time. Milk is good for the bones. - It's all right. - Sure it is. Just follow me. Come on. What brings you here, Grandpa? Old people living alone get money, right? - The government grants? - How much is it? It depends on the situation. If there are children or not, and any income... A rough guess! - A hundred dollars? - What? A hundred and fifty? That wouldn't even pay the damn gas bill! They'll give me all that money? Yes. It'd take more than a month to save up that much. - Thank you. - Sure... - Thank you so much. - It's from the government, not me. Thank them, too. Thank you. Thank you so much. Hurry and register her. - Did you print out the list of benefits? - Right. Here it is. It's so little! I'd get her more if I could... Me too. Could I have your ID? I don't have one. You don't have any ID? No... She can just make one now, right? You shouldn't impose. They've got more important government things to do. Government things? - Expedite her things, Yuna. - Okay. We'll make you an ID first. Can I have your name? SONG. Your first name? Well... Only. Only what? You're not understanding me. It's Only SONG. Write it down. Don't try to spell it out. As in "you're my only one"... That ONLY! That's good. Okay, gorgeous. Pretend to look away, and then one, two, three! Fantastic! - You have beautiful eyes. - Smile some more. You want to be smiling in your funeral picture. - What did you just say? - What? Why, I oughta... This is for her ID! Of course. An ID picture. Of course. - Get a good shot! - I will, sir. All right, gorgeous. Bring up all that energy from your toes, all the way up, and two, three! Bravo! Put 'er there! How dare he mess up my hair? Grumpy old fart. Bring me the salt! My goodness! - You're back, sir. - One more picture! - Print one more, idiot. - Okay. This way. Oh my... You're playing innocent now? - It's just that our regulations... - Screw your regulations. Don't you know who I am? I'll tell your boss and fire your ass. I apologize. I'll be back once I get this checked at the auto shop. I'm sorry, sir. Have a nice day. Dad. Young-ok. What are you doing here? Just... Let's go inside. Damn it. I should move out of this rough neighborhood. What the hell? They covered it up! This is destruction of evidence! Goddamn it! Anyone home? Granny? What brings you here? Come on in. Please excuse the mess. Your ID came out. Here. Only SONG. You should receive the grant starting from next month. How could I ever thank you? - It's nothing, really. - How kind of you. Wait one minute. - No, I should get going... - I'll be right back. Granny. Yes? Everyone is scared of Grandpa. Aren't you scared of him? He has a foul mouth, but he's soft inside. When he said your name back at the town hall... "Only SONG"... I thought he was really saying, "There's only SONG for me. " Are you all right? My hand slipped... I think Grandpa really likes you. Don't you think so? I shouldn't have brought out such a humble meal. No, it's great. Is this what I think it is? It's one of my favorite vegetables. How did you know? What was your name? It's KIM Yuna. Just like the pretty girl who ice skates. People say I look like her too. And you're really cute too, Granny. - Digestive medicine, please. - Sure. I'm sorry for asking you again. I can help you with the security deposit. I know I should see Mom, too... But the diner is busy. I'm sorry. Go on. FIXED DEPOSIT ACCOUNT I'm going to live with Mom and Dad forever. Don't worry about retirement. You've got two reliable sons. I'll become rich and support you. - Make a lot, please. - Don't worry. We've got nothing to worry about. Since the commute is so long... We're going to move out once we get married. I'm sorry we won't be living with you. Help yourself. That's how our eldest son left. - You should get going. - Right. We'll visit often. There's no need for that. I'm sorry we rushed it when Mom's health is so bad. But we'll visit often. We became people they talked of visiting often. Now we 're a couple again. We used to be a family. Sheesh. Hey, punk. Did you see SONG? Why are you looking for her? Don't question me. Just answer my question. She's been in the manager's office a lot these days. What? Ocean. O- C-E-A-N... You write well now. Why is he flashing smiles at her? And why is she smiling back? You're getting much better. Jesus! - Go away! - What are you doing? Go! That's good. Have a nice day. What are you doing here? I should get going. Are you looking for SONG? Don't call her SONG. Her name is Only SONG now. - Ms. SONG went to my house. - What? You dragged her into your house now? You're always swearing so much. And you're that popular because you don't? Let's go inside. Let's have some tea. " Let's have some tea. " He doesn't get how serious this is. Here. It's a pinwheel! It's spinning! - You're good at it. - Thank you. I don't drink coffee! You can't take her away with this lousy coffee. Don't you see this? I'm tougher than I look! I'll speak casually since we're about the same age. See if I care. I'm teaching her how to read. How to read? Do you know what she learned to spell first? Your name. KIM Man-seok. Drink up before it gets cold. It tastes pretty good. How sweet. You're pretty jumpy these days. You're home early. I gave Granny SONG her ID today. You did? Grandpa. You like her, don't you? What? You like Granny SONG. Me? Yes. - That's what you sensed? - Yes. You think she'd sense it too? Of course. Aw, shucks. Go tell her. It's enough if she senses it. - You have to tell her yourself. - Why? Because Granny SONG is a woman too. Telling her yourself makes all the difference. What do I say? " I love you, dear. " You're crazy! You have to tell her. Go and tell her, "I love you, dear. " Yuna. For people our age, "dear" is meant for our spouses. What that means is... "Dear" is only for your late grandmother. It's the least respect that I can pay her. I looked at her ID and her birthday is tomorrow. Good night. Wait for me, dear. Slow down, please. What are you dawdling for? Hurry up. - Help me move the table. - Lazy old woman. You can carry it one at a time. Pick up some digestive medicine. At least pretend to listen to me! How could you not know when it's gotten so severe? If the cancer spread so much, shouldn't she be in pain? She probably was, in a great amount of pain. Dear, buy me some milk. Why milk, all of a sudden? - You're going yourself? - Who else is there to go? Why not? She can't have any dairy products. - Just let her have one. - Give it to me, sir. I mean it. - But she wants some milk. - No, she can't. She won't have any more. They're saying that milk isn't good for you. This is nice, though. Having my blunt husband taking care of me for once. Just get well. I'll buy you milk every day. Would you be all right? Would it be okay if I do? Where are all the small rocks? It's rather big... Can I come in for a minute? You're not curious about why I didn't work today? I'm sure you had some reason. You wouldn't for no reason. So, you didn't wait for me? I waited. The kitchen's through here? Stay right there. It's your birthday today. Should we get the lights? Yes. No, I meant those lights. Wait. Why are you in such a hurry? Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. You could clap along. Happy birthday my Only SONG. Happy birthday to you. Dam n lyrics. I wanted to get you a cheap ring or something, but the stores were closed. Here. My arm is hurting. You're not opening it? My dear... I love you. You can blow them out now. THANK YOU, KIM MAN-SEOK. FROM ONLY SONG What did you do today? Tell me. Well... I don't know what I'm doing, to be honest. My mind is elsewhere all day. Like I'm dreaming with my eyes open. Eyes open? How long has it been like this? I don't know. My tummy hurts a lot. She's okay, right? What did they say? Should we all go on a picnic? This is the taxi I used to drive. No one would take it and I couldn't throw it away, either. A lot like us, eh? I don't know if I could... go on without her. The test results aren't even back yet. Honey! Look here, Kun-bong. I don't have any friends. Because of my bad temper, I guess. Is that okay, though? Seems I've made a new friend at this old age. You came to us too late. The best we can do is to relieve her with painkillers. You should prepare yourself... Mommy... Don't cry. If you cry, then I cry too. Why is it so cold this spring? Why are you here? I have to work, Grandpa. Work. Don't mind me. How does this work? It's not for you, Grandpa. - Did you buy gloves? - Oh, no. - Did they catch your eye, though? - What? I didn't buy them. They were a gift. Nice and soft because it's real leather. How did you notice when I didn't say anything? Because it's high quality leather, eh? Have a nice day everyone! Come straight home after work. Good day, gentlemen. What brings you here, Gramps? - That looks like a bad move. - You even have gloves on. Well, aren't you sharp! - How'd you know that it's leather? - I never said anything about leather... It's different from that fake synthetic stuff. No air slips in between the fingers. Take a look. Sounds nice, doesn't it? Have a nice day, then. You too, Gramps. Is he sick or something? Real leather does sound nice, though. Huh? Academy lessons? Missing one day won't kill him. Bring him with you. NOW HIRING? MANAGER We'll be waiting for you then. All right. Bye. - What's that sign for? - You're here. Is it because of your wife? I was thinking about taking her on a trip. - Is that from SONG? - Yeah, isn't it nice? It's real cow leather. Nice and soft. Hello? It's you. As long as you're coming. Don't be late. And bring the kids. We'll be waiting. All right. Are they thinking of moving in with us? - You know we have two kids, right? - Come on. We have kids too. My kids are in high school. Should we look into a cheap nursing home? They have Young-ok. She's their favorite, anyway. - You two come inside too. - Yes, sir! We're all here, Dad. Honey. These kids... You brought them into the world. So many of them, eh? You did good, honey. Is there something wrong, Dad? - You can all go now. - What? - Go on. - Dad. Get up. Come on. - I'm sorry, Dad. - No need for that. I'll pay you back as soon as I can. Get on home. Go. Go on. - Go. - Thank you. Come again. Goodbye all of you. You can sleep in now. - Is this everything? - Yes. Wait, I'll take that! Woah! Are you all right? - Are you hurt? - How typical of me. What are you taking these for? It's such a waste. You wear them everywhere, don't you? These are special gloves, buddy. Be good to SONG, Man-seok. We could all go any day now, at this old age. Stop trying to sound so wise. We've had such a long life together. I'd still pick you in my next life. What about you? You always gave to me and I only took from you. I couldn't do that to you again You know what? You're so beautiful. - More beautiful with age. - Liar. I'm serious. Don't cry. It's bitter. I'm so sorry. Goodbye. I'm a timid old man. I couldn't go on without you. So hold on tight to my hand. Let's find each other again. Gramps. Someone named JANG Kun-bong left this for you yesterday. - Kun-bong was here? - Someone like that. Dear Man-seok... I was quite lonely, but I enjoyed my time with you and SONG. Thanks to you two, we now have good memories to cherish. For so many years, my wife and I have depended on each other. I was afraid of being left behind. So I've decided to go with my wife. Since we've always been at each other's side. Man-seok. I have a favor to ask. I don't want the world to know how we left. Don't want to cause trouble for our children. Thank you, my friend. JANG'S HOUSE Damn fool worried for his kids even as he died. You did the right thing. Kun-bong would be very grateful. How did they pass away? They slept through a gas leak. heard they were a loving couple. - How old were they? - Seventy-seven, I heard. - It was quite timely. - Su re. They would've just lived to burden their children. - It was timely. - Better than troubling their kids. That's what everyone is saying. What's so timely about it, you punks! What's so timely about it? - We didn't mean it like that, sir. - How can any death be good? Should all us old folks just die? Crazy bastards! Timely, my ass! Kun-bong! They're saying that you died at a good time! That it's good you died, you damn fool. Only... What's on your mind? Man-seok... Why are you stalling? You're going back to your hometown? Because you don't want to lose me? That's right. Because I don't want to lose you. Death will tear us apart soon enough, and I don't think I could stand it. How could I let you go? The first happiness of my life... I want to go back home, and grow old cherishing it. Listen to me. You think we can meet again? We'll never see each other again! Go, then. Just leave me! Let's never see each other again! Don't even come if you hear that I died! I'll take you. To your home. WELCOME TO SURARI HILL 600M ABOVE SEA LEVEL Only... I just felt like saying your name. Man-seok... I just wanted to say it too. Could I hold you once? Could we see each other again? Could we see each other before we die? - Grandpa. - Yeah. - You're here again? - Coming from work? Why did you let her go, then? Don't worry. This will pass. I'll get used to it. Life is about getting used to things. This is our house. So you moved in here. Yes, with my mom. That's sweet of you. The granny who lived here asked me to. She said it's dangerous for motorcycles in the dark. Directed by CHOO Chang-Min Translated by Stefanie Y. Hong
