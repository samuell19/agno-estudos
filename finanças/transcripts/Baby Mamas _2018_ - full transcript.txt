You must live every day as if it's going to be your last. What must I bring you from the zoo, Mommy? You can bring me anything you like. Oh, just don't bring me an elephant. It won't fit into this small house of ours. That's exactly how I used to live, until six years ago when I found out that I was pregnant with my son. That was both the best and worst day of my life. That's the day I became a baby mama. Let's go, before we get stuck in traffic. Here's your bag. - Oh, enjoy your day, guys. - Jacket? Bye, Mommy. Uh, Tumi, please make sure your son doesn't bring me any animals from the zoo. Can't promise you anything. Bye. - No. You keep the change. - Thank you very much, sir. Okay. Hey, are you sure you don't want to join me in Cape Town for the conference? I mean, my PA can easily book a ticket for you. Unlike you, I am not the CEO of the company I work for. I can't just take unexpected trips to Cape Town. Take leave. Hmm? You do know I'll be just here when you get back from Cape Town, eh? Yeah. Tell you what? What's up? Hmm? Don't do anything I wouldn't do while I'm gone, right? Of course. Uh... Jonga, take yourself out for the spa treatment. Baby. Hmm? Mm. Hmm! - Mm-mm-mm, Look at you. - Stop. Stop. You look quite gorgeous yourself. - And so do you. - Sizwe, don't. - Hmm? - We're going to be late for work. Don't. - It's for a minute. - Baby, don't. No, no, stop it. You're so bad. You're terrible. I can't believe you always get me. Now, a baby mama, is a female who has a child with a male, usually outside of wedlock. The male and the female don't always see eye to eye, often because of the female's decision to keep the baby. Once the child is here, conflict can be increased by one party's refusal to help raise the child. - Hi, Ma. - Morning. How did things go with Thandiwe? Oh, well, you know how she gets after she comes from seeing her father. Never stops talking about him. Mm. Did he bring her back on time last night? - Yes, but... - But what, Ma? The party that usually refuses is the male... leaving the female to fend for the child with the help of family and friends. It was his girlfriend who brought Thandiwe into the house. What? He let that woman bring my child into my house, Ma? - Ma, I'll call you back. - Sandy. I will call you back, Ma. In cases where the male changes his mind and wants to be a part of the child's life, that causes a different kind of conflict. Hey, Sandy. Ntuthuko, how dare you bring that woman into my mother's house? Sandy, don't you think it's a bit early for us to be fighting about this? Can we talk about his later? - We're gonna talk about it now, Ntuthuko! - What do you want from me, Sandy? I brought the child back on time. You didn't tell me there's people I can have or not have in my own car. Oh, I see. You're trying me, eh? You're really, really trying me. Okay, for your information, it was actually Thandiwe who asked Khethi to walk her in. So... Well, that is the last time you see my daughter. Oh, no, no, come on, Sandy, you can't do that. She's my daughter, too. She's been your daughter for two minutes, Ntuthuko. - Two min... - She's been mine for ten years. Okay, Sandy, okay. We're just being unreasonable here, we can talk... Wow. Baby. Howzit? Are you okay, baby? Yes. Are you sure? Yes. Baby, I can see you're not okay. What's wrong? Is it your parents? They're gonna kill me. What did you do? Why? This. What's this, Chantel? A pregnancy test, Keenan, and it's positive. Shit. Okay, how true are these things anyway? I suggest you go to the doctor to go make sure, okay? And then what? What if the doctor still says I'm pregnant, Keenan? Then we'll take care of it. Tumi is a great father. He was a lousy boyfriend, but he's a great father. Go. All right. I will come and pick you up later, eh? Bye, Dad. I love you. I love you, too, my boy. Toli. Tumi, I think you just sent me a message meant for your mom. No, it was actually meant for you. Thanks for dropping T off at creche. Remember it's your turn to pick him up all week. Neh? Yes, yes, I remember. Okay. Toli, what about the other part of the message? Yeah, you see? That's the part I thought was meant for your mom. It was meant for you. - Tumi... - Look, you don't have to say it back. I wasn't going to. - Ouch. - Thanks. Thank you for your love. Sure. Um, good luck with your interview this morning. Thank you. Thank you. I will see you tonight when you bring back my child. I'll still love you tonight. Bye-bye, Tumisang. Sometimes I wish I had someone to cuddle with at night, or just have a quickie with. But most times, I wonder if it won't just be easier to get back together with Tumi. Chantel? - Okay, let's try this again. - All right, yep. - Boom. - You look very handsome. You look gorgeous. Mm. Later. We're not gonna do this again. All right. Oh, swagger. I think we're hot. Wipe your lips. Let's go. Michael, I don't remember booking you this morning. Oh, no, I was busy upstairs, and I thought I'd come down and say good luck before I left. - Good luck? - Yeah, for your interview. You remembered! Thank you. I'll see you soon. I've gotta go. Good luck. - Oh, Chantel. - I'm sorry. Hey, friend, what's the matter? Is there anything I can do to help you? Friend? Okay, Toli, you've got this. I see you certainly do have a lot to offer our company. But you haven't told us why you should get this promotion. Something I think the HR department would also like to know. Yes. Thank you for that question, Mr. Pickering. I don't think I need to tell you why I should get this promotion. You've seen my stats in the last 12 months. Since I started in this position, no one has been able to match them. I've implemented systems that everyone was afraid to implement. I've improved staff morale and, as a result, the staff have been able to achieve great results. Overall, I have managed to bring in a little over one million rand in sales... We've read your resume. Toli, what are you going to do about your child? What exactly do you mean, sir? Don't take offense, but this is gonna be a very demanding job. There are times where you will have to work nights. I see here... you're always going off to fetch the boy from school, go to the doctor, parent/teacher meetings... What exactly were you hoping I'd do with my son? Sell him to the highest bidder? You're taking my question completely out of context. I didn't mean it like that, Evelyn. - What I meant... - You just meant that I shouldn't get the promotion because I'm a mother. Yes, I might need to get off early from time to time, but I can assure you that would never affect my overall performance. In fact, my son motivates me to work harder than anyone else here. I want to build a bright future for him, just like you've done with your kids, Mr. Pickering. Thank you, Toli, thank you for coming in. I think that will be all. You do know that we're interviewing other candidates? Of course. Thank you for seeing me. Thank you. So, spill, how'd it go? - I don't know. - No, Toli. What happened? That job was yours. Let's go make some tea and I'll tell you all about it. See you later. - So, tell me, are you still on diet? - What are you on about? Am I pouring five sugars or just one? Better pour five, chom, you've had a rough morning. I'm the one having a rough morning, but you're the one having five sugars? - Okay, friend. - What happened? Did "Pick-on-me" start with his old, dirty tricks again? - I am so over that man. - What did he do? So, basically, he asked me whether my being a mother - would affect my work. - What? Is he even allowed to ask that, friend? It is not our fault we have children. Just because he has a housewife does not mean we all have one as well. You know what, let's just go outside and have a smoke. I'll find you there. - I'm going to the bathroom. - Please bring my tea with you. - Sure. - Thanks, friend. So, there are four stages of being a baby mama. Chantel is going through the first one, the "what-will-people-say" stage. Ooh, I remember this stage. - Hello? - Keenan, Keenan? Keenan? Keenan? Hello? He hung up. Chantel, you really don't seem okay today. Are you sick? Do you wanna go home? Toli... I think I'm pregnant. This is when the baby mama is concerned about how her family, friends, and the community will view her when they find out that she is pregnant by someone who either denies the paternity of the child or is not ready to be a father as yet. The test said that you should do it in the morning, and I did, and it came out positive. Two pink lines means positive, right? Um, I think so. Friend, there's no need to panic, it really just depends on the test. Why not try going to the doctor just to be sure? It's not supposed to happen like this. I don't know why it's always the woman's fault when she gets pregnant. It's not like she was by herself when she conceived. I can't believe Pickering. He probably wants you to suck up to him so you can get that promotion. Ooh, shame. If he thinks I'm like the other girls that he's used to, he's got another thing coming. If he doesn't wanna give me the promotion, I will apply for it elsewhere. Where, Toli? Don't you dare leave me here. Friend, I found you here though. That's not the point. Did you hear from Joy this weekend? No, she was supposed to come my place, so I can take her to the bag place in town. No show. Oh, she's asking where we are. But where would we be at this time of the morning? Joy asks stupid questions. Would you leave her alone? Why are you so grumpy this morning? Ntuthuko. Who else? Have you told him you love him yet? Friend, you'd better get that out of the way. Hey, ladies, we slay, mm, all day! Mm. Good morning. - Look at us looking so pretty. - Hey, baby. Don't come here with your cheap flattery, neh, Joy. Why you so angry? Sandy, you know what you need to do? This part of your body, particularly this part of your body, you need to use it to get laid, get laid, get laid. Howzit? Who says I am not getting laid? Second of all, you were supposed to come over to my house, so I can show you the bag shop in town, remember? Oh! There's that. Sorry, friend. Something better came up. What, uh... So, basic rules of respect, neh? When something better comes along, you let the people that you had plans with know, i.e. your friends, - that you won't make it anymore. - Sandy, you're taking this so seriously, it's not like you had anything better to do. I actually did. Boutique hotel with Samuel. - Ooh! - Hey! And? - He wants me to go with him to Cape Town. - Really? But I have a J-O-B. - Of course you do. - Yes, you do. So... - girls... - Oh, dear. I didn't go to a boutique hotel, but... I was with Sizwe. Sizwe? The same Sizwe who kicked you out of the house in the middle of the night, - that Sizwe? - Why are you being so judgmental, though? He's better. He had issues back then. Friend, he used to beat you. I don't know why you would go back. See, you guys are always focusing on the negative, though. This is why I didn't want to tell you that Sizwe and I are back together again. Why can't you just be happy for me? Famous last words. He's better, he's changed. I swear, he's really a better man. You know we're talking marriage? No, you're talking marriage. That man is not going to marry you, or anyone else for that matter. Sorry, ladies, I've got to go. Where's Chantel? Friend, I actually saw her in the bathroom earlier. - Oh. - She's not okay. - Oh, no. - Clearly, we have a lot to catch up on. - Lunchtime? - No, no, no. - We've got that managers meeting at lunch. - I forgot about that. Dinner, drinks, my place, soon. - Sure, done. - Done. Tell Chantel when you see her. - Will do. Have a good day. - Later. - So can I tell you about Sizwe? - Uh-uh, wena. Don't talk to me. ♪ I thank God for making you my Baby Mama ♪ ♪ Baby Mama ♪ ♪ I thank God for making you my Baby Mama ♪ ♪ Baby Mama ♪ ♪ I thank God for making you my Baby Mama ♪ - ♪ Baby Mama ♪ - ♪ Yeah ♪ - ♪ Baby Mama ♪ - ♪ Yeah, oh ♪ ♪ Like a biggie, biggie ocean, yeah ♪ ♪ I'd sing this song for you 'Cause you're smooth like lotion ♪ - ♪ I like the drama, baby ♪ - ♪ I love the drama ♪ ♪ The drama, no, they make me lazy ♪ - ♪ You gon' be my wifey ♪ - ♪ Be my wife, oh ♪ - ♪ Baby Mama ♪ - ♪ Baby Mama, yeah ♪ - ♪ Baby Mama ♪ - ♪ Baby Mama ♪ What's this, Chantel? A pregnancy test, Keenan, and it's positive. Shit! I suggest you go to the doctor to go make sure, okay? And then what? What if the doctor still says I'm pregnant, Keenan? Then we'll take care of it. Chantel Steyn? Chantel? Follow me, please. I took a pregnancy test this morning and it came out positive. How accurate are these things? Well, they're quite accurate these days. Why don't you tell me what made you take the test in the first place? I missed my period. It always comes on time. And, uh, when was the last time you had your period? - The 22nd of last month. - The 22nd... All right. Let's, uh... Let's have a look. Hey! Shh, he's sleeping. Aw. What's with the stuffed animal? He promised you a lion, that's your lion. Aw. And this? Um, I heard the traffic was a mess, so I figured you'd be held up, so I'm cooking. Tumi, we need to talk. Not tonight. Tonight we eat, okay? While I appreciate the gesture, you do know you don't have to cook for me - in my house, right? - Oh, no, I know. And I wasn't cooking for you, I was cooking for our son. Okay. Toli... I know that we still love each other. - Um... - Okay. I still love you. And I know that you like me. But I want you to love me again. Look, I... I want us to be together again. Tumi... Something is burning! Oh, shit. I hope you didn't go to Ntuthuko's office this morning and start fighting with him. No, Ma, I didn't. I spoke to him on the phone. Huh. And what did you tell him? About what? That you still love him. Yoh. Hai, you don't understand, Mom. The sooner you let that boy know you love him, the better. It's not that simple, Mama. Well, make it simple. Because I am sick and tired of you fighting with him. Thandiwe, come eat, baby. Come, my baby. You eat. I was worried about you. I'm still pregnant. Okay, don't take this the wrong way, but is it mine? You see? You're taking it the wrong way. I... I just... You know, I don't know if being a father is part of my plans right now. Like, I'm still young and there's things I want to do. I want to buy a new car, there's these new sneakers coming out. Actually, I've got plans, Chantel. I'm sorry for ruining your plans, Keenan. You see? Taking it the wrong way again. I just expected more from someone who was raised by a single mother. Sizwe, baby, your phone's ringing. You have no business going through my phone. Yeah, I did not go through your phone. - And it's on silent, why? - Well, that's none of your business. I don't ask you about your phone, do I? What's going on? Things were okay until your phone rang. Things were okay until you went through my phone, Joy. I did not go through your phone. I didn't even see who was... Joy, Joy, you know what? I don't like it when you don't trust me. I'm so confused. What's going on here? What is going on is that you keep going through my damn phone! That's what's going on! You know what? Pack all your things and get the hell out of my house, right now. Joy... I'm sorry, okay. I didn't mean it. You didn't go through my phone, I'm sorry. - Sizwe... - I don't want to lose you again, okay? - Just... - I love you. Joy, hey... I love you. I'm sorry. Lizzy, baby! Lizzy! Why are you so happy? You should have told me. Told you what? I'm still a man. Stop it! You don't need me to tell you you're still a man, you know you are. And that Chantel might be having a little brother, or a sister. How? Chantel! Most girls never find out what it feels like to disappoint their parents. But those of us who've fallen pregnant before marriage get to see the sparkle fade right from their eyes. "That-woman-is-not-going near-my-child" stage, is the second and worst stage that any baby mama can be in. Because you want to be the only woman standing next to your baby daddy. You're getting heavy. Ready for school? - Yes, Baba. - A sucker? - Thank you. - Hey. In your mind, there's always a chance that you can still work out your issues, and have a great relationship going forward. But not everyone is that lucky. Hello, Sandy. So, it's not enough that you bring her here once, you have to bring her here again for effect? Okay, I'm sorry, Sandy. I didn't think you'd be so offended. Well, that's it, right there, Ntuthuko, I don't think you think at all. And the only reason I'm allowing you to take her today, is for that stupid Daddy and Daughter thing that is today. Well, thank you for allowing me... Sandy. I need to tell you something, and I don't want you to find it out - from other people, okay? - Yes. My uncles went over to Khethi's house to ask for her hand in marriage. And I know how you get, so I was wondering, if Thandi could possibly come to the wedding in a few months' time? It won't be any problems for you, I'll pick her up, I'll drop her off, there'll be nothing... Whoa. Wait. You're getting married? Yeah. So you don't think there's a chance for us to get back together? How? We tried that, all we do is fight all the time. We were young, I had some growing up to do. - Khethi makes me happy. - And I didn't? Come on, you can't take it like that. It just didn't work out between the both of us, okay? Oh... - Sandy... - Just please bring her back on time. What is it? What? Come. Come. What is it? He's getting married... to her. Oh, my dear. Oh, my love. So, how are you feeling? I'm okay, Ma. Listen, I know your dad and I were upset with the whole situation. But I want you to know, we're here for you, okay? Anything you need. Thank you. I know I disappointed you guys. No. Just... surprised. Have you thought about your options? And? I'm... going to keep the baby. I'm so glad. Oh, and your father will be too. I don't want you to feel alone at this time in your life. I know your mom's not around anymore. You've been the best stepmom any girl could ask for. Thanks. Yes, Mbali? Hi, Toli, Michael is here for you. Okay, cool, thank you. I'll be right there. Hey, Michael. - Hey, Toli. - Hmm. Looking beautiful as always. Thank you. Let me take you through. Let me know when you're done, I'll come back for you. Cool, well, I should be done just before lunch. - Maybe we can grab a bite together? - Sure. All right. Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to startle you. It's fine, I don't know where my head is. You've been staring at that screen all day. Are you okay? Last time we spoke... Yes, I was a mess. Have you and Keenan sorted things out yet? I wish. Decided to keep the baby though. That's great, Chantel. My parents have been so supportive. I thought they were gonna kill me. You are gonna be just fine. You have your parents and you've got us. Thanks, love. Keenan will come around. He's probably just scared. You know what, I think we need a proper catch-up session. I have not seen you girls in such a long time. Drinks at my house tomorrow night? That will be great. Just as long as there's juice. Of course. - Good day, how are you? - How are you? Good, thanks. Bubble-gum milkshake... and a hot chocolate. Thanks for the milkshake, Daddy. It's a pleasure, monster. It's my pleasure. What do you think of Sis'Khethi? I think she's nice. Think she's nice? You know that Daddy likes her, right? A lot. - Yes. - What would you say if I told you - that Daddy's gonna marry her? - Really? - Yeah. - Can I be a flower girl? Of course you can be a flower girl. I'd be honored to have you as a flower girl. Think your mom will be happy about me marrying somebody else? If she knows it's something that will make you happy, then she will be happy for you in the end. You think? I reckon also. High-five, monster. You're very smart. What are they teaching in grade three now? Physics? Do you know what physics is? That's cool. That's pretty much what I've been up to, you know, just looking after the business and my sister's overseas at the moment, - but my mom's still here. - Hmm. Oh. - Thanks. - Thank you. And any girlfriends? There must be a long queue of women waiting in line. I wish. It seems the one woman that I really like, just doesn't seem to notice me. Really? Who wouldn't notice that cute smile of yours? You have no idea, do you? Huh? It's you, Toli. Michael... Sorry, I got to rush, but this has been a really good day. It has indeed. We should do it again sometime? Maybe dinner? Let me bring my A-game this time. I... I would like to see your A-game. Good. - I'll be in touch. - Cool. Refill. - Yes. - Thank you. Finally. - Yeah! - There you go. - The thirst, oh, my gosh. - Grapes for Chantel. So, we spoke about his mom and sister, how he's been looking after them since his dad passed away. Oh, Toli, he sounds like such a sweet person though. Yeah, yeah, yeah, sweet, sweet, sweet. When are you guys kissing? - Hey? - Who says we haven't already? - Wow! - Hey, now? Hey. And? How was it? Well... He kissed me on the cheek. You are such an embarrassment. That doesn't count as a kiss though, at all. - Mm. - You guys didn't specify - where this kiss should be. - Oh, no, friend, I mean, is that how you got pregnant with Tshepo? With a peck on the cheek? That would mean that Tumi was depriving you - of all that goodness. - Yes. It's all still very new. I don't even know if we should even be together. There you go again, Toli. Always finding reason to avoid being happy with someone. Yes. - I do not avoid being happy. - Nuh-uh. You do. You always do it. Okay, let's put you to the test. - Girls, help me with this one. - Let go. So isn't it for the past couple of months, Tumi has been begging you guys to get back together again, and what's your response? Deny, deny... Deny! Uh-huh-huh. Are you guys forgetting what Tumi did to me? Yes, we know what he did, friend, but that doesn't mean Michael's going to do the same thing. I mean, he's a little bit more mature than what Tumi was when you started dating. You can't even compare the two. I agree with them. I don't think Michael is the type of person who would... See, let's run a checklist. - One, knock you up. - Yeah. - Two, deny paternity. - Uh-huh. Three, get his crazy side-chicks to call you, drive you crazy, and not even contribute a cent towards your medical bills. Yes, guys. To be fair, Tumi was very young when he did that. - Uh-uh, soeke. - It's been years now, he's changed, right? You'd swear Tumi and Keenan were raised in the same house. - Same WhatsApp. - Same WhatsApp group. Still no word from him? Nothing! I've sent him messages asking if we can meet so we can talk, he doesn't reply. Hmm, Chantel, let's be honest. If he were to call, would you take him back? Honestly, guys, I don't know what I want from him. You see, now? That, for me, is a big problem. You're gonna have to sort that out, 'cause you know what's gonna happen to you in your life? You're gonna end up with a baby daddy that you still love, and he's moved on and now you miserable. - Wow. Uh-uh. - No, true story. - Whoa. Whoa. Stop now. - True... What? Why are we throwing shade now? No, guys, be fair. I'm not throwing any shade. - Oh? - I'm telling her as it is, true story. What would you like to see happen? You wanna see our poor, little friend here date married men who aren't available, because also she's got these little hopes that Keenan's gonna come back to her. - Guys, come on. - Wow... Girl, take my advice. You are so over-simplifying it, it's not even funny. Okay. Is that not what's happening in your life? Guys? - Yes, but... - Thank you. Stop right there. - I rest... I rest my case. - What? Toli, top me up! Let's drink! - When did this come to me now? - I win. - Oh, my... Wow! - I will... - Wow. Wow. - Did you just throw a grape at me? - Well, you deserve more! - I will eat that grape and drink these grapes. Okay, you don't have to rub it in. Yes! - I won! - All right. It is time for us to go to bed. - Let's go. - But, Dad, if I go to sleep, you won't have anyone left to talk to. Yeah, but if you go to bed, then I can stay up all night practicing this game and making sure that I beat you tomorrow. If I go and sleep, you come sleep with me. No, I don't have bedtime. Remember? You do. Okay, fine. Can I drink some milk first, then I'll go to sleep? Tshepo, what is it with these delay tactics? You never negotiate with your mother when you have to go to bed. - Why do you do it with me? - 'Cause Mom says, "I don't negotiate with kids!" Well, I don't negotiate with kids either. So it is time for you to go to bed. Let's go. Mommy, can I ask you something? Go ahead, son. How did my father react when you told him that you were pregnant with me? Such a deep question so late at night. Why do you wanna talk about such things? I'm just asking. Well, he wanted nothing to do with me when I told him I was pregnant. He just disappeared. His family said he had gone to the army. Oh, I see. My parents also wanted nothing to do with me. My pregnancy had brought shame to the family name. That's why they sent me to live with my aunt. But what if he had his reasons for running away? Well, I hope I raised you to be a better man than that. Not one that will run away after making a girl pregnant. What if I'm not that guy? You are. You saw how I struggled to raise you. I don't think you have it in you to put someone through that. - Keenan? - Yes. Is there something you wanna tell me? Chantel says she's pregnant. Well, I hope you do the right thing. - There you go. - Thank you. I'm so glad you could make it. Thanks for the invite. Wow. You have really outdone yourself, Mr. Rembrandt. I'm really glad you like it. All right. Okay. Red wine? Are you trying to take advantage of me? I'm just trying to take care of you. - Want some salad? - Yes. Thank you. I come with a lot of baggage, Michael. It's a good thing I've got strong arms, I'll help you carry it. I also have a handsome son, you know. I love children. Okay, you got me. Cheers. Cheers. Much better than the office canteen, right? Much. No, no, no, honey. Let's get you more comfortable. - Okay. - There we go. - Oh, thank you. - There we go. - Mm. - Anything else I can bring? No, no, no, no. - Come here. - Okay. - You... - Mm-hmm? - Okay. - Have been nothing... - Mm-hmm? - But loving and caring to me. Thank you. My love, it's just that I... I don't want you to think that I don't care because I don't see you every day. No, baby, you see, as soon as we get married, that won't be a problem. Uh... Yes. But you know I'm not ready for that step yet. Juice? Let me bring you some juice. Hey, Sandy. - Show. - Oh. There it is. You didn't have to bring her textbook all the way here. She needs to be more responsible and not leave her things just lying around. No, it's okay, Sandy, I don't mind. - Well, thank you. - Thank you. Thank you. I'll see you in court. Court? Sandy! Sandy... Chantel! Chantel! Hi. Good morning. Oh, these are for you. Your favorite flowers. What are you expecting to happen right now, Keenan? That you would take the flowers. And then? And then I would tell you that I'm sorry, for everything. And then we would get back together. - You think this is a soapy, don't you? - Ow! Don't come back here again. Tumi, hey. Sorry to keep you waiting. You know how difficult Pickering can be when I need to get out. It's okay. I already took the liberty of ordering your favorite drink for you. Thank you. Listen. Remember we need to talk. Yes. I told you that I love you a few weeks ago and you still haven't said it back to me. It's not that I don't love you back. I mean... I've known you since I was a teenager. It's just... I've never had another boyfriend besides you, and I think... I just wanna see what else is out there. There isn't much out there, though. No. I... I don't mean it like that. It's just that I know what I want now, Toli. I want you and Tshepo in my life, for good. Yoh. Tumi... there was a time in our lives when I really, really needed to hear those words from you... but those words never came. I know that I hurt you. But I need you in my life, Toli. You and I are at a great place as parents right now. Yeah, I think you are a great father to our son. And we are great friends. Tumi, I spent the last few years chasing you... now... I... have someone in my life. Is it serious? It's new. And I don't know if it will be serious. Sandy? Sandy, is this perfectly necessary? Would you rather your child goes to bed hungry, Ntuthuko. Of course not, Sandy, but that's not... I don't earn enough money to give any more money. Oh, but you have money for a wedding? - Is this what you brought me here for? - Oh, don't flatter yourself. Okay, quiet now. Why do you need more money, Sandy? Our child has grown, Magistrate. There are things that she needs that I can't pay for on my own. - You don't raise kids on things. - Exactly. Ntuthuko, you're currently paying 1,800 a month. - Imagine. - Yes, sir. But I don't earn any more money to give. You've been paying this amount for the last two years. I think we can increase it to at least 2,200. Will that help? Yes. Yes, of course. Yes, it will, Magistrate. I'll see you back here again twelve months from now. Try not to kill each other before then. - I don't have that money. - Yes, you do. - I don't. - You do. Your financial records say you do. Come back next month if he hasn't paid in full. Of cour... Thank you, I will. - Thank you, Magistrate. - Hambani. Sir. Damn. All this... Cheers, guys. Good night. I'll see you tomorrow. Hey, baby. Are you still on your way? Honey, can you rather come over tomorrow, please? I'm still stuck here in the office. Really? Sizwe, seriously? Hey, come on, I'll make it up to you. I just need to finish this presentation. It's fine. Listen, I've got a call coming through. Let me take it. We'll speak later. Bye, gorgeous. Hello, Joy speaking. This is Busi. Sizwe's girlfriend. Excuse me, you're Sizwe's what? The mother of Sizwe's unborn child. E... Excuse me? You heard me right. I just wanted to tell you to just please leave Sizwe alone. I'm expecting a son and he doesn't need distractions like you in his life. Thank you. Please forgive us for coming to your house at this late hour. I knock off late at work. It's all right, so what brings you here? My son asked me to bring him. He has something to say to your family and your daughter. Um, I just wanted to say, Mr. and Mrs. Steyn... that I'm sorry for how I handled things with Chantel. I don't know why I acted the way I did. I don't why you've apologized to me. It's not as if you made me pregnant and forgot somehow to answer my calls. I'm sorry, Chantel. You hurt my daughter, Keenan. And when you hurt my daughter, you hurt me. I know, sir. I'm sorry. You said that already. Okay, I think Keenan has poured out his heart to Chantel and to us. So, now we need to look at a way forward. Yes, Mrs. Steyn. I want you to know that I will look after your daughter and the baby. I can look after my own daughter. You see, I wasn't overwhelmed by my responsibility as a man. I know, sir. I will look after the baby. Thank you for being so understanding. I still love you. I need to go pee. Please help yourself.

What's going on, huh? What are you doing? Don't ask me that. Don't. What have you done to my place? What have I done? What have I done? Sizwe... what have you... What have you done to my heart? What are you talking about? The neighbors called the cops. I mean, why on earth would you do something like this? Who's Busi? Who? Don't! Don't! - Hey! - Don't lie to me! All right, okay. Don't. Busi... Busi's just some girl. You're lying again. "Oh, Busi is just some girl." Some girl that's pregnant. Pregnant with your baby. My Sizwe, my Sizwe. She's pregnant with your baby. You think I'm a fool. How many times, Sizwe? How many times have you beaten me up in this place? And nobody's called the cops. Nobody. I come here and break just a few plates, look behind you! Look behind you! They come running in. Get out of my way! - Get out! - Joy, relax. Shut up and get out of my way! Arrest me, please. Won't you please be a gentleman, and grab my shoes and my bag. I said all I could say to your parents. But honestly, baby, I was stupid. Are you trying to get me to feel sorry for you, Keenan? No, not like that. I really want to be involved with the baby. But I also want you back. You think I'm an alarm clock you can switch on and off as you please? No. I want to prove myself to you. - Keenan... - Just give me one last chance. - Please. - But you... You can even call it off in the end. But I want you to know that I've given it my all. Please? I don't know. I mean, I think sometimes things start out good... but then something happens and all that goodness disappears. Yeah, but I think then there was no goodness to begin with. I'm scared you'll break my heart, Michael. I'm scared you'll break my heart, but I wanna take the risk anyway. I don't know. I don't know if I'm ready for something serious. I'm ready for all of you, Toli. You turn my life upside down in the best possible way. I want something serious with you and Tshepo. Sorry. Hello? I'm at the police station. Joy? Joy, hello? What's wrong? Um, Joy's at the police station. I'm sorry, I have to go. What are you doing? Where are you going? I'm coming with you. I'll grab your stuff from the kitchen. Thanks. There she is. Joy? Hey. I'm so sorry, Toli. It's okay, friend. It's okay. You warned me about Sizwe. Everyone warned me about Sizwe. I didn't listen. You love him, friend. Not anymore. What happened? Toli, you know how much I wanted that man's baby. And then he goes and he gets another woman pregnant. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. - I'm so stupid. - No, no. No. The "How-could-you" stage of being a baby mama is a tough one to find yourself in. You realize that the signs that your relationship won't work have always been there. When the shit hits the fan, you're forced to look at your relationship through a different lens. - They say he won't press charges. - I'm glad. Let's go home, yeah? Please help me, thanks. There you go. Thanks guys. Hi, howzit, babe? Sorry I'm late. What time is our appointment? - Any time now. - Okay, cool. Chantel Steyn, the doctor will see you now. There you go, just a few more weeks to go. Thank you, Doctor. You're welcome. I think he looks like me. No, he doesn't. I think you're right, I think he looks exactly like you. Do me a favor, take very good care of Chantel and that baby until I see you again, okay? Okay, Doctor. - Yeah, thank you. - Thanks, guys. I told you. These wine glasses, yours are nicer. - Girl, you know I got style. - I know. I'm so hungry. As always we're waiting for Sandy. The way she likes to diss me about running late. It's 'cause you always late, friend. - Cheers for being early. - That's not true. No, yeah, yeah, yeah, actually. - Askies, askies, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. - Mm-hmm. Hello, baby. Finally, wena. - Ladies. - Hello! - I'm so glad Chantel is not here yet. - Mm. I wanted to check if we can have a baby shower for her? That's nice. I don't know why I didn't think of that. That's a great idea. But I was thinking, neh. - We have it more intimate. - Uh-uh. - Intimate? - Yeah. Sandy, for a baby shower? - Yeah. - Come on. Maybe we can have a weekend away. Guys, we've been talking about going to Harties. We never got around to doing it. This is the time. - That's true. - Neh? Yeah, and we could all use a weekend away, hey? - So badly. - But wait, there's more. - Always. - Oh, jeez. Guys, give me a chance. - I was thinking... - Mm-hmm? We keep it as a surprise, neh? Until that very last minute. Girl, why you so addicted to complicating things? I actually like it. Yes. - Ah, yes. Yes, yes, yes. Yes. - No. No. Seriously? - Yes, yes, yes. - Joy. I like the concept of a weekend away, but now, like, the complications of... Road trip. Road trip. - You know you wanna. - Road trip. Road trip. Road trip. Majority rules. Road trip. That's fine. So, Dad, are you and Mommy gonna get married someday? - I don't know. - Why? I don't know why, Tshepo. Why don't you know? Mommy is pretty. I know that Mommy's pretty. I just don't think that it will be a good idea for Mom and I to get married right now. Then you need to find a girlfriend, Daddy. Ah, Tshepo. - Hello, ladies. - Come, come, come, oh, my gosh. Oh, tsomponontso. He's so big now. Look at that cute nose. Oh, my, oh, my God. Oh, you did good. Let me see. Mommy's nose. Chantel, Daddy's eyes, he's gonna be a heartbreaker. No! He better not be. So, I haven't seen you ladies in a while. - I know. - Hi! But I'm glad to see y'all are still dedicated to drinking wine. - Yes. - Yes. - Oh, yes. You know it. Of course. - And I'm drinking extra today. Ntuthuko? He's getting married to his girlfriend. Sorry. I don't understand why he has to marry her. You know? And why must my daughter be at that wedding? Sandy, you're gonna have to get it, hey? He's marrying her because he loves her. I mean, you guys know deep down, I thought we could work things out. You know? - You need to let it go, friend. - Mm. Oh, it's not that easy, Toli. - I know. I know. - And then there's Samuel. He's been MIA lately. Every time we make plans, he just cancels at the last minute. Uh-uh, you're also just a mountain of issues. Isn't it that you wanted him because he's unavailable. Generally, that's what married men do, they just don't leave the house because you want them. No, it's not how it works. You know, I find when I give you ladies advice, the sun shines on me and the day becomes nicer. Feels like a better day. Don't you see it? True story. The glow, you don't see it? Thank you, Libanditi. Oh, wow. I hear you wanna be Minister of Correctional Services now. What did you expect me to do though? - Hlayos. - You know he deserved it. But what's the point? You're gonna get back together with him anyway. - Uh-uh. - Really? Nope. Not this time around. I'm so over Sizwe and his nonsense. Like, so done with him. So, babes, you're gonna go cold turkey. But I thought you said his machine is the... Don't get it twisted. He give it good. He lay it down thick and nice, but no, thank you. I'm, like, totally over him and I truly believe that there's good men out there. There are, and they're all after Toli over here. True story. True story. Tumi and Michael have her on a high. Look at her. Look at this. I actually told Tumi about Michael. You lie. And? How did he react? Girl... Nobody cares. Nobody cares. You need to give it up to Michael and stop kissing each other on the cheeks. - Please. You need it. Right? - Hallelujah. Please. Please. You know I never agree with anything she says, but this time... Finally. Same WhatsApp group. The last stage of being a baby mama is where I find myself, the "I-love-you but-I-can't-be-with-you" stage. Tumi and I get along well, but I have been through too much with him to know that I could never go back to being in a relationship with him. It just wouldn't work. We are better as friends and as co-parents. - Hey, why is it so quiet... - Shh. He passed out. I was actually gonna call you and ask if it's okay if you pick him up tomorrow instead? Yeah, that's fine, he can sleep over tonight. Maybe... Maybe you can too. Stop it, Tumi. - You know I'm seeing someone. - Yeah. - Juice? - Mm-hmm. You know, at some point, our son will have to meet the people we date. Yeah, don't remind me. He was actually asking me... why are we not married. - No! - Yeah. What did you say? Nothing much. But he did tell me to get a girlfriend. - He's right, you know. - I know he's right. Some day. So... I've never introduced another man to Tshepo before. Yes? So, how do I do it? So you want to introduce your new man to Tshepo. Yeah. And... you're asking me how to do it? Yes. How am I supposed to know? Well, you're a guy, and you're his father. Do you think he's ready for something like that? I think he can handle it. He's a smart boy. But as to how you're supposed to do it... Look, Toli, I don't wanna lose my street cred now. - Street cred? - Yes. You've never had any. That's why. Even your son wants you to get a girlfriend. He's worried about your street cred. Well, last I checked, my street cred worked perfectly well on you. Mm. This is you... Girls! It's done. The booking for the getaway. - Oh! - Yes. So you'll let us know what to bring in terms of food, drinks, decor... I'll get in touch with Chantel's mom, ask her to pack her bags for her. - Fantastic. - Yes. Then we're gonna have to get her out of the chalet for a few hours so we can prep the room for the baby shower. It's cool, we'll make a plan. - Yay! - Ah! All righty, lots to do, gotta go. Thanks, bye. - My tea. - It's okay. I don't suppose I can pop in on this weekend away? Absolutely no boys allowed. Okay, what if I drove you there? Nice try, Michael. Tumi's giving me his car for the weekend. Mine is too small for all of us. Taking your ex's car? Yeah. He always gives it to me when I need it. He's the reason you can't get serious with me, isn't it? No. It's not that. And I am serious about us. I don't think so. I mean, you could have asked for my car, but you didn't. I... See what I mean? He's still the first person you go to when you need help. That really hurts. Food's ready. Sorry, I've lost my appetite. Michael... - Good evening, ma'am. - Hi. Ah, you're not Samuel. It was pre-ordered, ma'am. Thank you, have a great evening. Thank you. - Mommy? - Hmm? Why are your bags packed? - Where are you going? - Nowhere. What do you mean? What were you doing in my room anyway? I stay here, remember? You know, you ask too many questions. Does Daddy know your bags are packed? There you go, asking questions again. - Hey. - Hello. What are you girls doing here? Well, we're here to fetch you. - Yes. - Are her bags packed? - I'll go and get them. - Mommy, you were in on this? - We're going on a girls weekend away. - But, girls... Don't worry, everything is sorted out. - You stress too much. - Oh, here we go. Oh, thank you, Ma. We'll see you when we get back. Did you pack my toothbrush? Did you pack my vitamins? She's your mom, she has you covered. - Thanks, Ma, bye. - Bye. Hello, sir. - Thank you, sir. - Stop it now, Joy. Thank you. - Mm, I love to watch you walk away. - Take it off. Gosh, before I hurt myself. So how's it going with Michael? Michael is great, but... But what? He's being so childish. He got upset because I told him Tumi gave me the car for the weekend. Okay. So how would you feel if Michael was giving his ex-girlfriend his car for the weekend? - It's not the same thing. - Uh-uh. See, that's where you get it wrong, Toli. It's exactly the same thing. What if Tshepo doesn't like Michael, and vice versa? Oh, my... how did we go from a car to Michael and Tshepo not liking each other? Guys, I'm scared to introduce a new man into my son's life. - Yeah? - Michael doesn't have a child. You guys know, my son comes first. Babes, it's normal to be scared. And at some point, Toli, you're gonna have to trust that it's all gonna work out in the end. Exactly. Look at my mom and I. We love each other. Most people don't even know that she's my stepmom. And to make it sweeter, she doesn't have kids of her own. I don't know. Also, look at Sandy and Ntuthuko. Thandiwe really likes Ntuthuko's new girlfriend. Right, Sands? Wow, she does. It could work out for Michael and Tshepo. You just have to be upfront with your son and don't make him feel like he's not part of your new journey. Also, Toli, try not make him choose between the two men. You guys have been doing really great at this co-parenting thing. Friend, don't mess it up, hey. I hear you. - You guys are right. - We always are. Ha! I only have on question though. Mm-hmm? A white guy? It is not my fault he's into chocolate, okay? Oh, goodness, oh, my gosh. How are things with you, Chantel? Better. Keenan thinks we're back together. And? Are you? Are you? I guess. I'm learning to forgive and not forget. You know, your situation reminded me of when Tumi said he wasn't the father of our child. I didn't know it was possible to feel that much pain. But I'm glad Keenan came to his senses sooner than Tumi did. Mm-hmm. I think he just got scared. I think they forget that we are just as scared as they are. Except we can't run away. Yeah. You guys will never guess who's been calling me. - Who? - I said, guess, Sandy. Well, it can't be Sizwe, so... - Well... - Well, what? Well, Sizwe's been calling. Joy, you just can't seem to say no to this man. - What does he want? - I don't know. I have not been taking his calls. Don't lie, we won't judge you. I swear, I have nothing to say to that man. Do you still want him back? Joy! You want him back? That's not what I said. Babes, you didn't have to say a thing. Seriously, I don't want Sizwe back. I am done with that man. Then what did he say? I don't know, I've not been taking his calls. Guys, maybe he just wants to apologize. Oh, Chantel. Sweet, sweet, Chantel. This is how you fell pregnant. Sizwe is not the apologizing type. He is not. Some milk? Please. Anybody see the sugar? Chantel, please get the door. Hello. - Hi, Evelyn. - Good morning. Bye, Evelyn. Bye. - Thank you, Evelyn. - Bye-bye. - She wouldn't leave. Let's do it. - Decor. Let's go. ♪ It's time to love myself ♪ ♪ Not you, I'm through with you ♪ ♪ It's time to love myself ♪ ♪ Not you, I'm through with you ♪ ♪ Been trying to keep you happy, baby ♪ ♪ Mm ♪ ♪ Can't ever seem to reach that depth of you ♪ ♪ Baby, can't you see ♪ ♪ Not you... ♪ - Oh, almost there. Almost there. - She's gonna be here anytime. There she is. - Yeah? - There she is. Come in! Surprise! You guys are the sweetest! Come, come, come, come, come... - Take a seat. - Come, come, come. Sit. Why didn't you guys tell me? Because then it wouldn't have been a surprise, Chantel, would it? Would you like something to drink, Chantel? Maybe you can have some water! - Sure. - Yes, please. Pass my drink to me. - Mine too, please. - No problem. So I think I should have been a bartender, 'cause watch my skill. Watch my skill. - Yes! - I slay. - All day. - All day! - Yes. - No tray... - Thank you. - Here's yours. - Okay, start... - Put... - What? - Put the gift down. Sandy, put the gift down. She supposed to guess, you're ruining it. - Sheesh. - Put the gift down. Take your drink. - I completely forgot. - Stop acting like you don't know - what baby showers are about. - I'm so sorry, Minister of Baby Showers. It's okay, ladies. How about we all start with a short message from each one of us to Chantel and the baby and then she can open the gifts in her own time. Okay, I'll start. To Chantel and... We don't know the baby's name. - Actually... - So, guys... Keenan and I decided to keep the baby's name a secret until the baby's born. - What? Okay. - Okay. - It's fine, it's her day. - Yes. Okay. All right, to Chantel... Ooh. I wish you well on this journey to motherhood. You will cry, you will laugh, but most of all, you will love like you've never loved before. To the baby with no name yet... I cannot wait to meet you! - Oh, well done, Aunty Sandy. - So sweet. Okay, so I'll go next. So obviously I don't have a baby, right? But what I want to say to you, Chantel, is please don't deprive yourself of a sex life because of that baby that's growing in your belly... - Joy! - What? Do you have another message for Chantel and the baby? - Maybe. - Yeah. It's a very important message. It is. Have you seen how deprived they are? Have you seen how depressed they are? That is because they deprive themselves of a sex life, so do not deprive Keenan of his baby daddy duties. Don't do it. - Don't do it. - Thank you, Joy. And don't make another one. Not yet. - Thank you. - Who invited you? Oh, don't it. Apologies for our strange friend. My turn, my turn. Chantel, you came into our lives for a reason. You make us laugh. You've allowed all of us to be big sisters to you. So I just wanna say, we love you and the baby. And you must always remember that we'll be here for you no matter what. - Yay! - Girl! - Thank you, guys. - I love you, guys. - You guys are the best. - We love you. Wow. What is happening? - Oh, my goodness. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Morning. - You have been busy. - This looks so beautiful. - Darling. Looks amazing. - Have a seat now. - So hungry. Wow, this is gorgeous, sho. So... I just wanted to thank you ladies for this weekend. I really appreciate you. Friend, you didn't have to make us breakfast, you're pregnant. Pregnant, not ill. Exactly. What, were you gonna make us breakfast, Toli? - No. - Thank you, so, allow Chantel to flourish in serving the queendom. - Thank you. - What she said. On that note, I'd like to make a toast. To the amazing women in my life, may we find true love... may we appreciate it once we have it, and may we never, ever, ever, settle for less. - Mm. - Here, here! Cheers. Wait for me. Wait for me. Wait for me. This is so good. Can we dig in? - Dig in. - Yes! This is so good. I think I'm gonna have champagne for breakfast. Won't you please pass me those. Thank you. I think I am going to tell Michael how I feel. I really, really like him. I wanna see where this relationship will end up. I'm so glad. I'm so, so glad you're finally coming to your senses. It's good. I think I'm gonna let Ntuthuko go. What? It's time, guys. How else will I find true love? Guys... I think I'm going to forgive Keenan. Give our relationship another chance. Obviously not rush anything... but it's worth it. Good for you. I think I'm gonna close the Sizwe chapter for good. I think my only regret is that I didn't listen to you ladies sooner. Come here. Come. Come. Come. - Thank you. - Look, they're hugging. Mr. Rembrandt. - Hey, Toli. - Hey. - How was your weekend? - It was good. Really good. Can I sit? Thanks. I'm sorry. I get it now. I'm listening. I was scared... of letting you into my life... of introducing you to my son. What about now? I'm still scared... but I'm doing it anyway. Michael, you're my man and... I want us to be serious. You sure? Well, that's if you haven't found another girl? Well, not as sexy as you. Toli, I really wanna meet Tshepo, but there's something I need to do first that's very important. Okay. First give me some love. We can't always control everything. Some things will happen the way they are supposed to. Tumi, howzit? - Michael. - Tumi. Nice to meet you. Have a seat. Can I get you a coffee or something? A cappuccino? Coffee's fine. Can I get some coffees, please, brother. What province is Cape Town in? Western Cape. Write it down. Are you going to leave tonight, Mommy? No, my love, I'm not going anywhere. Right, and what province is Durban in? - KZN. - Up top. Other things we have to take into our own hands. Such a beautiful evening, hey? Yeah, it is. So, are you not... I guess you're not that... That hungry. Keenan, what's with the balloons? Well, I didn't think you liked flowers that much. Sense of humor, neh? Keenan? What are you doing? Look, I know I haven't been the perfect guy to you... but you have been perfection to me. You've changed my life around. You've made me into a man that I never thought I could be. You are the mother of my child, and I love you, Chantel, with my whole heart. I want to love you every day going forward. Will you marry me? Keenan, I do love you, with my whole heart. We've been through some stuff together, but we're still standing. I don't want us to get married because I'm pregnant. I want us to get married because we can't live without each other. Ask me again in a few months from now, when you are sure that you're doing this for the right reasons, and not because you feel pressured in doing the right thing just because I'm pregnant. But I do love you. Babes, I know, but this is not how I imagined it. Keenan, I want the fairy tale... not when I'm feeling like a whale. But whatever decision we make has to put our children first and make them happy. Here you go, my boy. Have some tea. Thank you. So, wedding is this weekend. Yeah, yeah. We're very excited. I can imagine. It's all Thandiwe talks about. I hope I haven't upset Sandy too much. Oh, don't worry about my daughter. She's stronger than you think. She'll be fine... eventually. Ma... you know this wasn't my intention, right? I didn't mean for... For me and Sandy to work out the way we did. That's not what I wanted. My boy... you really don't have to apologize to me. - Hello, Daddy. - Hey, monster. Can I go put this in your car? Is it locked? No, no, no. Come, give me a squeeze. - What? - Car keys, Daddy? No. It's not locked. Somebody is inside the car. Bye, Mommy. Bye, Gogo. Bye. It's her, isn't it? In the car? Sandy, come on. We had so many errands, so much work that we had to do. What are you doing, Sandy? Sandy. Listen, Sandy, what? Okay, wait. Sandy! Sandy. Sandy, Sandy... Sandy. Mama, please don't do this. What are you doing anyway, Sandy? - Hi. - Hi. I'm Thandiwe's mom. I'm Sandy. Hi, I'm Khethi, I'm Ntuthuko's fiancée. I figured I should come and introduce myself, since my daughter spends quite a bit of time at your place, and when she's there, you take care of her. - Oh, she's... We love having her. - She... She's fantastic. A star. You should ask her to give you my number. For anything and everything pertaining to her. Oh, okay. Um, I'll do that. I hope you're not too stressed. - About the wedding. - Oh, a little bit. It's fine. It's great. All the best, sis. Thank you. Thank you so much. Tha. Don't forget to give Aunty Khethi my number. I will, Ma. Love you. I love you, too. How did this happen? I don't know. - Guys, what's going on here? - Shh! Oh... What are you going to do? I'm going to keep it. Okay, okay, okay... Are you going to tell Sizwe? I don't know, maybe. Maybe. It's going to be rough. Okay. Are you happy? And Joy did become a baby mama after all! All right! All right! Come, come, come! You're gonna be a mommy. You're gonna be a mommy. You're gonna be a mom. Okay. All right. All right. You do know now you gonna have to start answering Sizwe's calls and... Oh! - Right? - Yeah? Oh, my God. Okay. Oh, there's two! Hello, baby. Hello, baby. Aunty Sandy's your favorite, Aunty Sandy's your favorite, Aunty Sandy's your favorite, Aunty Sandy's your favorite... Michael, hi. Come on in. - Hey. - Hey. - How are you? - Good. Good. Thank you. Nana, I'd like you to come meet Uncle Michael. Hello, Uncle Michael, I'm Tshepo. Hey, buddy. I've heard so much about you.
