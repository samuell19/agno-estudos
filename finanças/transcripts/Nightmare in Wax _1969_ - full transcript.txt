(dramatic music) (laughing) (upbeat music) (chatter) - Ladies and gentlemen. Ladies and gentlemen please. I know your all aware of the reason for this little celebration. And it's only fitting that I Matt Black head of Paragon Studios should make the announcement. But first a toast to the lovely Marie Morgan. One of Hollywood's and Paragon's top stars. (cheers) And to that young man, who was so sensational in my last film that he will be costarring with Ms. Morgan in her next The Three Sisters, Mr. Tony Deen. (cheers) And now that the commercials are out of the way let me make the official announcement of the engagement of Marie and Tony. (cheers) Wish them both a happy marriage. (cheers) (dramatic music) - [Max] Marie take good care of him for me will you dear? - [Marie] Yes thank you Max, thank you for everything. - [Max] Not at all. (dramatic music) (tires squealing) - Goodnight Max. (eerie music) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) You! (dramatic music) (dramatic music) - This is Rudolph Valentino the greatest lover in the history of film. Most of you are too young to remember his glorious and triumphant career. But from the first moment he appeared on the screen his magnetic personality captivated the hearts of all women. He became the first matinee idol. He became the symbol of romance, glamour, and a dream of impassioned women all over the world. - I'll take any of The Beatles. - There have been many screen lovers from Tyrone Power to Clark Gable who try to emulate him without success. There have been many casting agents who think that I should play the story of his life. (laughter) But I don't want to be typed. (laughter) Now here's the group you've been reading about. The three stars who work for Paragon Studios who mysteriously disappeared one by one. Stella Costello, Ralph Tenier, and Leslie Packet. Another figure will be added to this group soon, that of Tony Deen. The last star that disappeared only three months ago. These disappearances remain one of the great unsolved mysteries of Hollywood. Right this way. (eerie music) (dramatic music) Well my baby, I'm very proud of you. You could be a great lady. Immortalized in wax. You could be the face that launched a 1,000 ships. Helen of Troy, a princess, the woman of Don Quixote. You could be these and more my darling. But unfortunately in just a day. (phone ringing) - Yeah. - There's a Detective Haskell to see Mr. Vincent Rinard, would he be in? - I'll be happy to see Mr. Haskell send him in. - Mr. Rinard is in the workroom. The door next to Marilyn Monroe. - Thanks. - Excuse me my baby, we have a visitor. I'll be back. Mr. Haskell, is this visit social, or official, or? - [Haskell] Official, you remember my partner Bud Carver. - [Vincent] Yes Mr. Carver. - [Bud] Mr. Vincent. - Well I haven't seen you since the Tony Deen thing. - Yeah the Tony Deen case is still open. - [Vincent] Yes I know, what should I do to help? - Well, remember you told me that you were gonna make a wax figure of Tony Deen to join the others here at the museum? - Oh yes, I'm working on it. - Mind if we take a look at it? Well if there's no objections. - No, no objections, certainly not. It happens to be here. - Gee that looks like him. - [Vincent] It's remarkable. - Remarkable. - Naturally. - Naturally. - Yeah, naturally. Tell me has there been any unusual curiosity over this? - No, only a small rumor, nothing serious. - What small rumor? - I don't like to say it. - Well do me a favor will you? Say it anyway. - Well it's rather petty of me and I don't like to repeat rumors. But there's a story going around that Paragon and Max Black had a two million dollar policy on Tony. - [Bud] That could be the motive. - A motive for what? - Come now Mr. Haskell. - Now wait a minute, it's never been established that Tony Deen was murdered, if that's what you're getting at. He's still classified as missing. - Money, especially insurance money, is a pretty good motive. - [Bud] The best. - Number one suspect. The insurer of the insured. - Now listen Tony Deen's box office potential was worth millions to Paragon Pictures. Besides insurance companies don't pay off without a (speaking foreign language) - That's a body. - Thank you Mr. Carver, you know, you know I rather like this Mr. Haskell, and I rather like you. I love to play games, do you mind if I carry it further? - [Haskell] Not at all. - Good, we have number one motive money, number two. - Jealousy? - Mr. Deen had announced his engagement to Ms. Marie Morgan on April 3rd, and begging your pardon Mr. Vincent, not counting Mr. Black, there were two between you and Mr. Deen. A Mr. Ralph Tenier and a Leslie Packard. Both incidentally among missing and - [Both] Both under contract with Paragon Pictures. - Thank you very much Mr. Carver. - Thank you Mr. Carver. - [Vincent] That leaves us two motives so far. - [Haskell] So what does all this prove? - Legally, nothing except Marie's case of death. (dramatic music) - [Haskell] You managed to survived, now she survived Ms. Morgan and Mr. Black. - Yes. I was shall we say fortunate. (soft music) Soft what light through yonder window breaks? Tis the east and Juliet is the sun. Arise fair sun and kill the moon with envious delight. - O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo? - Well I'll tell you Juliet, old Romeo he's out there in that there woodshed, and he's hiding his secret love. From all them Capulets and Montagues and Black Maxs. - Darling it won't be long. - You keep saying that Juliet honey, you've said it for weeks. - Well Max has been good to me, I can't forget that. - Max is good to Max. He treats you important because you are important. But importance is the one commodity that Max Black ain't never gonna have no how, no way. - Perhaps, but I can't forget what he's done for me. I don't know he built my confidence up. Developed one ability I have. - That was an investment honey. And it sure paid off. - Well whatever the reasons are, I am grateful. - You can be grateful honey, be grateful all you want. But look at it from my point of view, how do you think I feel? This fat, old man. This old, lecherous, evil, wicked man, yeah. He shows you off. He mauls you and he calls you. - Max is a stubborn old man. - I know honey but look, tell him tell him today will you? Today? - He'll fire you. - I don't want to work no how. Besides there's always UI. - UI? - Unemployment insurance. (soft sexy music) - Do you love me? - Oh baby do I. You fill the moon with envious delight. - Oh don't kill it Vinny, I want it, I want the moon. I want the moon, and the sun, and all the stars. - Oh baby, I want you. (dramatic music) - You can't go through with this, I won't let you! - Oh Max we have been through this a 100 times, now I love Vinny and I'm going to marry him and that's all there is to it. - You'll marry Vinny over my dead body! - Now Max don't, Max it's time for me to go. - Now look you can't do this to me, I made you a star! You belong to me. - Nobody belongs to anybody. Max you're a wreck. - Nobody does this to Max Black, not nobody. You're mine and nobody's going to take you away from me, nobody do you hear? Nobody! - Oh Max, come on you're hurting me! - Come on Max. - You shut up! Look okay so I'm high, but you're an opportunist. You're all through. I'm Max Black, I made you head of make up. I can make you so tiny again the devil will never be able to find you! - Sure Max boy let's do it tomorrow, right now let's go home, hmm? - I'll leave when I'm ready to leave. - Max if you have any consideration. - You shut up! You're an opportunistic little. - Aren't we all Max? Now come on you want to fire me, you'll fire me tomorrow. Come on, I'll take you home. (dramatic music) (screaming) (dramatic music) (screaming) (dramatic music) (screaming) (dramatic music) (screaming) (dramatic music) (screaming) (dramatic music) - [Haskell] Well it was an accident wasn't it? - Was it? - Still hurts huh? - No Mr. Haskell, I accept it as unintentional. (clanking on floor) - I'm sorry Mr. Vincent. - That's quite alright. - Well we got to be going. - Mr. Haskell, this is now my life. These creatures, creating, I'm happy. Very happy here. I have no time, no room for regrets or bitterness. I have only time for my work. - [Haskell] Well thanks very much for your time. - [Bud] I'm sorry again Mr. Vincent. - Oh wait, perhaps you'd like to have that as a souvenir? - [Bud] Gee thanks Mr. Vincent. - No thanks, anyway, let's go Carver. - Goodbye gentlemen. - I suppose he's got a good reason to hate Max. His face, and loosing that doll Marie Morgan. - We're well tattered Bud, nothing makes sense. You know if something would've happened to Max, or even Marie. I don't know. Maybe there is no connection. - Maybe some mug just doesn't like actors. - Yeah. You know I'm beginning to hate them myself. Let's go have a little talk with Marie Morgan. - You're my family, Theresa, huh? My happy family, shrunken head you've come home. I'm not hateful, why should I be hateful? I survived, I was lucky. (chuckles) I'm not bitter, and I'm not vindictive. Not at all. I'm sweet. I'm lovely. And charming. And I make beautiful works of art. Shrunken heads, dummy. I don't like you. I don't like you. I don't like you. I don't like you. But I'm not sinful. And I'm not vindictive. And I'm a terribly nice man. Understand? Agree? Agree, yes! (dramatic music) (doorbell ringing) - Can I help you? - [Haskell] Yes please, we'd like to see Ms. Morgan. - I'm sorry but Ms. Morgan won't see anybody. - [Haskell] Then I'm afraid I'll have to insist ma'am. I'm Detective Haskell. - Terry it's alright, let them in. Mr. Haskell. - Ms. Morgan. - [Marie] Have you heard anything? - Oh I'm afraid not, this is just a routine follow up. - Oh this is Sargent Bud Carver. - How do you do? Please. It's been three months, six days. No information. Nothing accomplished in all this time. I don't know it just seems very strange that someone can disappear off the face of the earth with no trace. - Well it's usually like some kind of a jigsaw puzzle until you find all the missing pieces. But for now only three people are involved in this case. You, Max, and Vincent, and no apparent motive. - Please sit. Sit down. - Well let's see what we do have to go on. Now Max, that is Mr. Black, he was your, well your first boyfriend, right? - Yes, before Vincent. - He was kind of jealous of Vincent wasn't he? And in fact he was the one that caused Vincent to have that accident? - It was a long time ago. (soft music) (dramatic music) It's been a long time. Vinny why don't you want to see me? (dramatic music) I know you're upset about the accident. Well you're overly sensitive about Max. You were drunk Vinny. - Really? (dramatic music) - Don't send me away. Talk to me. - Darling, get out. - You do wonderful things. You can have surgery and. (soft music) They can give you a new eye. (gasps) (soft music) - Give me a new eye. (laughs) When all you can remember is this! (crying) Look at it Marie! Look at it, I want you to look at it! I want you to look at it, look, look! (dramatic music) Make me an eye, make me an eye! Give me a new eye! (dramatic music) (crying) (dramatic music) - It's not a pretty story is it? - No. - I suppose you're aware of the fact that Vincent is making a wax figure of Tony for the museum? - He is? Well now with Ralph, Stella, and Leslie? - I guess that's the general idea. - I don't know if I like that. I don't want to share Tony with everybody else. Don't tell him Mr. Haskell, I. - I suppose I covered about everything just for now. Good day Ms. Morgan. (dramatic music) - Tony. (dramatic music) - Tell me Bud, by now the shocker of things should've worn off. Sure seems to be taking it pretty hard though don't she? - Just doesn't seem logical that she should of had anything to do with it. Unless she's a nut too. (dramatic music) - Yeah. (dramatic music) (phone ringing) - Hello. - Hi Vinny, it's been a long time. (dramatic music) - Yes. A long time. - I suppose I should've called you but I. - Unreasonable? - No, unapproachable. (chuckles) - Well they say that I'm beautiful. - Always. Am I disturbing you? - No, not at all. - Well I understand that your wax figures are very good. - [Vincent] Thank you. - Are you? Are you doing Tony? - Well he's practically finished. Just needs a few touches. - Well tell me then does he look good? (dramatic music) - The best I've ever done, a masterpiece. - Why don't you come over for dinner? (dramatic music) - I'm not ready. (dramatic music) - Please Vinny. - I'll come for dinner. - Thank you Vinny, early? - Early. (dramatic music) - [Tony] Hello Marie, hello Marie, hello Marie, hello Marie, hello Marie, hello Marie, hello Marie. - Shut up. - Hello Marie, hello Marie, hello Marie, hello Marie, hello Marie, hello Marie, hello Marie, hello Marie, hello Marie, hello Marie, hello Marie, hello Marie, hello Marie, hello Marie, hello Marie, hello Marie, hel-lo Marie, hel-lo Ma-rie, hello, Marie. (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (doorbell ringing) - Oh Terry would you get that please? It's only Vinny. (soft music) - It's not Vincent, it's a Mr. Max Black. (dramatic music) - Hi Marie. Sorry to barge in like this, but you wouldn't return my phone calls. - Well the answer is still no Max. There was nothing to decide. - Look. I'm a patient man, but I've got a studio to run, and you've got a contract to fulfill. - I'm not interested in making pictures. Didn't I make myself clear? - Alright, so your lover died, but three months is an awfully long time. Look here, I've been through these affairs of yours before, but I know I was rough on you. - Tony Deen was not just an affair as you so slightly put it. I loved him in a way that you wouldn't understand. - Look Marie, this is Max, not the press, not your fans. You've been going for me. So I made you a star. - That's not a very convincing offer. - Marie you're so unreasonable, so bitter. - You're damn right I'm bitter! Someone doesn't like to see me happy. I'm beginning to be typecast. - Marie I've got a great script for you. Suspense picture it'd be directed by Alford Herman. Look sweetheart, you can't throw away your career. Don't let the public down. - You mean don't let Maxie down is that it? - Alright, it's true, I need you. Without you I'm through. The can pull it right out from me. - Well Max you're through because I am not doing another picture. - I'll sue you, I'll sue you for everything. - Say you're gonna sue me, but there is an act of God clause. - Act of God! - Or was Tony's disappearance an act of God? (doorbell ringing) If you don't mind I am expecting company. Will you please leave? - I won't leave, not until you promise to do this picture. You're holding up production here. I'll call you. - When? When will you call? - Soon, tomorrow. (dramatic music) - Vincent. (dramatic music) It's been a long time. - Yes. (dramatic music) - Vincent she's gonna throw away her career and mine. Alone, Herman. (dramatic music) I'll be in touch, I'll be in contact tomorrow. I shouldn't forget this baby. (dramatic music) - I'm sorry, how are you? You're hand. You're shaking. Come on we need a drink. (dramatic music) Hey come on. I wanted this to be a nice evening. - I agree, you want something. - How is it you always understood me? Maybe that's why I'm still so fond of you. - Are you Marie? In between the others. - Hey, Vinny, you're not being fair. You know that there was only you and Tony. (dramatic music) - Shame on me. (dramatic music) (soft music) - Well you shoved me right out of your life, I tried every way to stick to you. - Yes you tried too hard. Let's forget that Marie. We're gonna stay rich friends. Though I can't possibly imagine what you want of me. (dramatic music) - Can't you imagine what will make me happy? - Let me see. Kill Max? - No. Don't be silly. - I give up what do you want? - I want the wax of head of Tony that you're doing at the museum. (dramatic music) - You want Tony. - [Marie] Can I have him? - You'd like me to give up Tony, hmm? (dramatic music) - Would you do me that favor? - Well I could make you a complete replica of Tony Deen. Then you could completely retreat from reality. I could make you a total recluse. Tony is alive sharing your thoughts, your dinner table, your bed, there's a name for like that. - Oh I'm not sick. Just like having a photograph of him, that's all. Oh Vinny, you must know what it's like to be in love. Really in love. For the first time in your life you really feel outside of yourself. Someone who's more important than you. - Yes, maybe I had the standard. Maybe I experienced this. - Yep. With us it was different. We never really matured, but with Tony oh it was special. I'd sell my soul to the devil if I could have him back. - You can have him back. (dramatic music) For a price. - What price? - You. (dramatic music) The price is you, I want you to pose for me. - I'll pose for you, when? - Ill let you know, but there's one stipulation to this rather bizarre arrangement. - [Marie] What? - Discretion. (dramatic music) - [Marie] Oh thank you Vinny, I promise I won't tell anyone. - Yes it's better, no one. (dramatic music) No one. (dramatic music) - Good night. (chatter) Good night. Good night. Good night. - [Man] Good night. - It was delightful. - Good night. Alright everybody it's your special time. Time to go bedy bye. (singing to self) (upbeat music) (singing to self) Hiya Clark, this is one of your greatest films, Gone with the Wind. Frankly Scarlet, I just don't give a damn. Yeah. Pow pow! Got you Cook, you need more practice, you're getting rusty. And how are you tonight Stella my love? What should we do go dancing? Or should we fly to the moon again? (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (whimpers) (dramatic music) Mr. Black, Mr. Black! (dramatic music) Mr. Black. - Just a minute Nick. (dramatic music) - I saw her eyelids move, I saw her blink! - Mm hmm, here. Have a drink. - Thanks. - I could always suspect that you took a nip now and then. - Well I spill every once and a while, but I ain't an alcoholic, it's just a small bite. - How many tonight? - It wasn't the drinks, I really saw it. - Alright Nick. What did you see? - Well I always say goodnight to Stella, I pretend she's my girl. - That's nice. And tonight per chance she winked at you? - With both eyes. I wanted to be sure, wham, she did it again. - What were you drinking Nick? - It wasn't the drinks, I ain't a alcoholic. That's a secret I'd like to keep from the little woman. - Can you keep one? - What's that? - A secret. - You got a pRalphlem too? - No, nothing like that. Sometimes I talk to my friends here. Occasionally they answer me. Not really of course. - I understand you're talking to 'em and imagine they answer you but I saw it. I saw her eyelids move. - Yes of course you did Nick. But we won't tell anyone will we? - We won't tell nobody, they don't understand. - No they don't and we don't want to lose the best museum caretaker we've ever had now do we? - No sir we don't, I like it here. I like all my friends here, and they like me. - Of course they do. Of course they do Nick. I think we'll keep this confidential, hmm? - Confidential. And you'll keep my secret likewise? - Likewise Nick. - Likewise. Excuse me ma'am. - See you're talking to them. - That's nice. (dramatic music) - You are truly beautiful. (dramatic music) (speaking foreign language) Miguel. (dramatic music) Well my children, it's always good to see you. My three favorite zombies. How goes it Leslie? (dramatic music) That's my boy, I have news for you. I heard from Marie, she has a new friend. His name is Tony Deen. No comment huh? Now Stella I understand you've been mischievous again. Blink again. There you go blinking it frightens people. Well this should take care of you at least for some time. (dramatic music) You remember, you're not to blink, not even move. Nothing until I tell you. Excuse me.

Vinny, when you talk like that I blush. - You blush? - Yeah. Other men talk okay. But you I blush 'cause you're so class. - Oh thank you that's a lovely compliment. Cheers. - Cheers. Vinny you like my body? - Yes. - Yes. You just say yes and I'm goosebumps all over. - I'm sorry honey, I beg your pardon, what kind of bumps? - You know all bubbly, like champagne. Excited. - So true, so true. But you know seriously, it's rather good. I'm proud of your face, your head, your hair. It's a very good fit. - Peachy. What about the body? - That's peachy too, it will be. - When? - When? - When are you gonna make it? (laughing) I didn't mean that. I meant when are you gonna match the peachy face with the peachy all of me? - [Vincent] Soon baby, very soon, I'm checking out a few details. - I'm really going to be in a museum. - Yes. - Vinny I'm so touched. I could cry, just cry. - Don't. - Oh I can't wait to tell Max, he's using me in his next film. - You still see Max? - Like a calendar and always on a Sunday. - Do me a favor, do me a favor okay? - Okay. - This Sunday I want you to bring Max to the museum, late. You come alone at once, you don't tell him, you don't tell anyone else. Just you and me, we have a secret. Between us alone, alright? - I promise. - That's my girl. - And cRalph my heart. - You don't have to do that. What I need, what I want is discretion. - Discretion? - Shh. - Oh. Maybe more, maybe more. - And maybe more, on Sunday. The important thing is Sunday, late. - I promise, Sunday, late. Lola! (soft upbeat music) (dramatic music) - Morning Mr. Black. (dramatic music) - Come and see me Pam. - Might come early. - I was just getting myself a helicopter. How about the contracts, did you read them? Were they to your satisfaction? - Yes. - Good. - Except there are no mention that Marie Morgan's playing the lead. - Well I'm having a bit of trouble there, she's dying of a broken heart over Tony Deen's disappearance. - Very unfortunate tragedy. Make a great film. A femme fatale who kisses her lovers and they disappear. A female Mathias kiss of death. - A wonderful idea. Be a great follow up to Three Sisters. - Good, I'll put my writers to work on it. Now Mr. Black part of our agreement was for Ms. Morgan to play the lead in The Three Sisters, that's what attracted me to the deal in the first place. - I can't move that neurotic dame, I talked to her yesterday she gave me the Garbo, Camille bit you know? - Perhaps if I talk to her. - Would you? That's a fine idea. Get Ms. Morgan on the phone. - Yes sir. - What's her weakness? What do I appeal to? Career, money, her vanity. - Tony. - Tony? - Tony Deen, a tribute to him. The Three Sisters is about a scientist or hypnotizes people. We can use Tony in the picture. - You mean footage of his last film? - No, no. Do you remember Vincent Rinard who used to be head of makeup for me here? Did you ever hear of him? Well anyway he's a genius. The greatest man with a sponge perhaps since Lon Chaney. - He was working at the Wax Museum. - That's right. That means we hit her on her head with Tony Deen. - And we shoot the scene in the museum. - Right! Here she is now. - Hi Ms. Morgan. Alfred Herman here. - This is me. - Ms. Morgan I was just thinking of The Three Sisters which we're going to do together and I wanted to call you and tell you I think you're going to be just wonderful. And I'm looking forward to directing you in it. - Oh well I can't do that Mr. Herman. I could never work on that picture. See Tony and I were. - My dear that's exactly why you should do it. We're changing the locale to the Wax Museum and featuring the statue of Tony Deen. Yes, it's going to be a tribute to his memory. Ms. Morgan if you really cared for him, you'd want this. Yes. I'll personally go and talk to Vincent. I'd like to talk Mr. Rinard. - It'd be rude of me to make you come to Paragon. - Once she knew that we were going to use Tony's head she agreed as a final tribute to him. - Well hello Stella, I remember directing you in The Vampire. She's so lifelike, hard to believe she's gone. - Maybe she isn't. Like your plot Mr. Herman, maybe she's hypnotized by a maniac. You know there's a thing about hypnosis, and old, old theory that you cannot really make the person do anything that he doesn't want to do while under it. - We take literary license, it's still the best gimmick. - Mm hmm. You heard about Dr. Zertag's theory? You take pentathol the truth serum, controls the mind. Maybe we control the nerve. It's possible to put a person to sleep and wake centuries later. - Merely a theory it never worked out in the experiment. Seems that electricity revived him. - Electricity? - Had my research staff check into the latest report. If a person touches them the electricity from their bodies disturbs the nerving path. An electrical storm could disturb the effects. - You sure about that? - Absolutely! - Hmm, very interesting. You could always use license, hmm? - The public is familiar with the Svengali approach. Why should I educate them? Well Vincent, can we get your okay to shoot a few scenes here? - I'll let you know my answer in a couple of days. I have to think it over. - You know I usually appear in a short scene in each of my films, sort of a trademark. Perhaps in The Three Sisters I should be one of the statues? - Good, maybe one day you'll pose for me. - I'd be delighted. - Goodnight Mr. Herman. - Goodbye. - Well Nick you seen any blinking eyes lately? - Not a thing since I've been on the wagon. - Good. I'm expecting some visitors tonight, I'll let him in, you lock up. - Yes sir, good night. - Good night. (eerie music) (dramatic music) - Why are you being so mysterious, why won't you tell me where we're going? - Because I want it to be a surprise. It's not far now. (dramatic music) - I don't like surprises, besides, I have plans myself for this evening, for us. - I bet they were original, let me guess. First we just have a steak at Jason's. And then a couple of drinks at Geno's. And because you're interested in that new singer. - I am not. - Yes. And then we go to your little hideaway house in the hills above the Strip. (horn honking) - You drive you! Yeah. - From there your man will have chilled the bottle of champagne. - Or two. - Or two. And then there would be a fire in the fireplace. And soft light and music. And then you would tell me about that part you have for me in your next film. - You are cute. Can you think of anything more interesting to do, or rewarding? - Yeah, what I have planned. And then we can do your act. (laughs) There it is, that's where we're going. - That's the Wax Museum, it's closed. - We'll just go around to the rear entrance, and Vincent Rinard is expecting us. - Us? - Yeah, he told me to bring you along. - He doesn't like me very much. - Who does? Except me sugar? The road. - Oh, we're here. (squeals) Here we are okay then. (dramatic music) (knocking on the door) (soft music) - Come in. - Hello doll. You know our Max. - Yeah I know Max. - How are you Vince? - I haven't told him anything yet. Where is it, can I see it? - What's all the mystery? - Theresa wanted you to be the first to see it. It's all ready for the unveiling. - Well don't keep me in suspense, unveil. - We really should have some fanfare, some Max Black fanfare but anyway. (dramatic music) - Oh. (dramatic music) Oh, beautiful. (soft music) Beautiful. - It's fabulous Vince. - Thank you. I'm proud of it. I believe this calls for a celebration. Would you like some wine Max? - Sure. - God bless, adorable. I mean, no one can tell whether it's the real me or not. - Yes, I'm very proud of it. I mean to put it in the museum. - It's fabulous Vince. - Oh by the way I spoke with Mr. Herman today. - Oh, was here to see about shooting pieces here? - [Vincent] Mm hmm. - That's the picture you're gonna be in sweetheart. - I want co-star billing, my own dressing room, a chauffeured limousine, and a speaking part. Okay Max? - Okay doll. - Oh let's drink a beautiful toast. - A beautiful toast. - I understand you've done a head of Tony Deen. - Yes. - Could I see it? - But of course. It's over here. - Hmm. It's unbelievable. It's so lifelike it's almost real! - [Vincent] I think you'd better sit down Max. - No, I'm alright. - I insist. Listen to me. You listen to me Max. He's alive, he's alive like you and me. He's not dead. He's aware of everything that's going on. - What are you doing? - Everything. He's paralyzed, only I control him. - What are you doing? - I'm going to preserve him for prosperity. - Why? - I'm preserving him. - Why? - My injections. It's my vendetta Max, my personal vendetta, do you hear me Max? And I have a place for you. I have a needle for you Max. You're gonna be famous Max. - [Max] No way. - You're going to be in my museum Max. People from miles around are gonna come and look at you Max. To wash out the failure. They're gonna come and laugh at you. They're gonna come and stare at you. They stared and laughed at me all these years. And they left me all his hair. (dramatic music) Now my pet, you're next. - Vinny what are you talking about? I didn't drink it. I hate drugs. - You should of baby, you should've. Would've been less painful. - Gee Vinny what are you gonna do with me? - Kill you. (dramatic music) Unfortunately I must. - Don't come near me Vinny, I'll scream! - I like it, I want you to scream. I want you to hate me, come here baby, come on, scream! - No. - [Vinny] Come on baby scream. (screams) Scream! Scream! - No Vinny, no Vinny, (screams) you're scaring me. - [Vinny] Scream! - No. - [Vinny] Scream! (screaming) Scream! Scream!

(dramatic music) (soft music) (dramatic music) (screaming) (dramatic music) (screaming) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (screaming) (dramatic music) (crying) (dramatic music) (screaming) (dramatic music) (screaming) (dramatic music) (screaming) (dramatic music) (whimpering) (dramatic music) (screams) (dramatic music) (moaning) (dramatic music) (crying) (soft sexy music) - Vinny, naughty Vinny. (chuckling softly) (dramatic music) - Why didn't you scream? Why didn't you just scream? Why didn't you just scream? (dramatic music) (laughs) What a party we're going to have Max. What a party. You need more. Steady. (groans) (dramatic music) Relax Max, relax. - Now tell me, what do you want of me? Name it, it's yours. - I don't want your power, I don't want your money boy. I want you, I'm giving you a shot on my ship. - What for? - From now on you're going to be one of my zombies. Maybe my favorite. Oh Max we're gonna have such a party. - Vincent you'll never get away with it. The police have been following me ever since Tony disappeared. They're waiting outside now, if I don't come out they're going to come in and. (dramatic music) Oh am I stupid. - Yes, you're stupid. (dramatic music) (dramatic music) Make it right. (dramatic music) Listen carefully Max. From now on you're mine, you belong to me. (laughing) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) - Hold on. There Max. - Yeah. (dramatic music) - Now baby we're a couple of lovers. We'll follow that idiot Haskell. (laughs) And old Max, what a party he's gonna have. Oh baby, he's gonna be the party. You'll never get me Haskell. Hey flower face, why don't you scream? Hmm? Make a little scream, would've liked it with a little scream. Oh baby, I didn't mean to hurt you. I didn't mean to offend you, no. (sirens) There, that's it, that's it! Make me wanna scream! Come on little old car, put it up, put it up. Come on fat old Lincoln! Fat old bag. (sirens) - Look at this guy, he's really starting to move. He's got it up to almost 90, he's trying to lose us! - Come on baby, oh yes, it's our party little flower. It's our engagement party. You're gonna be so lovely. You are little flower, you are. And in blue. Now how does that go? Something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue. Something blue. Oh Maria, I liked you in blue. Oh I love you in blue. I love you in blue. Burn baby. (sirens) Here we go. (sirens) (tires squealing) (dramatic music) (sirens) (dramatic music) - [Bud] He's there Lieutenant. - [Haskell] Let's get back. (dramatic music) - [Bud] It's the police Max Black, we know you're in here! - Will you shut up! (dramatic music) (dramatic music) Hold it will you, it opens there. (dramatic music) A dead end. (dramatic music) - Well he sure didn't take a boat. (dramatic music) (dramatic music) Looks like we're locked in Lieutenant. - [Haskell] That's right. (whimsical music) (soft music) - [Vincent] I'm sorry you're upset Marie. - Well you say you were the last to see them. - [Vincent] Mr. Haskell phoned, he's coming over. I knew he would. (knocking on door) He's here now I'll phone you later. - Okay. - Come in. Would you like some coffee. - No thanks. - Well it's quite a mess isn't it? - Yeah, it's quite a mess. I just got a few more little details I'd like to add to my report. - Anything. - Well first of all, why were you making a head of Theresa? - Somebody recommended it? - Oh. Just who specifically on the committee suggested Theresa? - I think the committee voted on it. - Do you think it was more than just a coincidence that Theresa should bring Max around last night? - Not really, it's a very small industry. Alfred Herman was here, he wanted to shoot some footage of the museum. For Max's next film, Theresa's going to be in it. And we're going to put her in the museum showroom. It's a natural for publicity, I think it's logical. - You said that they were arguing when they left here. What about? - Max said something about Theresa putting pressure on him. I don't really know, something about being compromised. - You know it's a lucky thing for you that we were trailing Max. Because otherwise it would have been you all over again that was the last one to see the deceased. - Lucky for me Mr. Haskell. - Gosh you know what's funny? Every time you start to sculpt somebody they either wind up dead or missing. I wouldn't be surprised if you were doing a head of Max right now. Who's this? - Oh it's nobody really. - Mind if I take a look? - No, not at all. (whimsical music) (dramatic music) Well I suppose now that Max is - Missing. - missing. One could assume that he could be responsible. - Oh that's a pretty good assumption, only we don't go by assumptions you know? We go by facts. And we don't know for a fact that Max is dead yet, now do we? - No, no we don't. - That's right. Well you see until we find his body then we want know for sure will we? - No we won't. - Hey how do you get out of this place? - Oh excuse me. You got to have a key. Sorry you need a key. Goodbye Mr. Haskell. - Oh not goodbye, I'll be seeing ya. (dramatic music) (dramatic music) - Well another half hour they'll be closed. - Why do all the leads wind up here at the museum? - Well like Vincent said, it's a small industry. Everybody's joined together by the type of work they do. - You know we don't no for sure that Max left the museum last night with Theresa. - What are you getting at? - Vincent could've killed 'em, and the girl. And driven off with the body. Where would that body be? - You mean it could be stashed away in there? - I don't know, boy I'd give plenty to find out. - Well let's get a search warrant. - There's no time for that. (tires squealing) Look there's Marie's car. Boy I got a hunch that something's gonna happen tonight. (dramatic music) (knocking on door) - Coming. (dramatic music) - [Vincent] Who is it? - [Marie] It's me. - Hello Marie. - Oh hi Vinny. Oh the storm. (thunder) What a wild place. (dramatic music) Hey I like your Turkish bath. Where's Tony? (dramatic music) (dramatic music) - Bud I'm going inside and hideout until after closing. Something's going on in there and I aim to find out what. - You want me to go along? - No you better stay here, now listen if Marie or Vincent come out you tail 'em. Don't worry about me. - Okay. (thunder) (dramatic music) - [Marie] It's magnificent. - Thank you. - It's as if he were alive. - I always liked your reputation. I'm glad. - I feel as though if I spoke to him he would answer me. May I touch him? - No. You better not. (dramatic music) - Goodnight everybody. Come back and see us. (thunder clapping) Good night Stella. (dramatic music) She's doing it again. I'm not drinking, my mind's really playing tricks on me. I've got the DTs. (dramatic music) Now they're all starting to move. Next they'll be talking to me. I got to have a drink, it's off the wagon for you Nick. You're seeing things again. (dramatic music) (dramatic music) - Come Marie, we'll make a mold of your face. - [Marie] Like Tony's? - [Vincent] Yes, like Tony's. This way. Under the cabinet. (dramatic music) You comfortable? - Oh very. Am I gonna be in here for long? - Only an eternity my dear. (dramatic music) Circumstances being what they are, it's the only way. - What are you talking about Vinny? - Don't worry about him, he's not dead. At least not yet, now he's my pet. He's in a state of limbo shall we say. Oh Marie, Tony's alive, he's alive. Look, Tony you may now breathe. - Tony? Tony speak to me. - Tony you heard the lady. - Marie! - What have you done to him? What have you done to him, what have you done to him? - I have here a special serum which I have perfected. One injection in the neck induces paralysis. At least, oh it's chocked full of vitamins and minerals. It can sustain life for long periods of time. Under my control 'cause I control him. Shortly you'll receive the same injection. - Awe Vinny, let me out of here please? Vinny you can't do this! - But I can my dear. If I can't have you the right way, then I shall have you another way. - Oh Tony tell me this is a nightmare. Tony do you hear me? - Of course he can hear you. (laughs) But he won't listen to you. He'll only listen to me. Watch please. Tony you can move, you can breathe. I want you to get up and release Max from the cabin. - Max. Max is alive? (dramatic music) - [Vincent] Yes not for long. (dramatic music) - Oh Max. (dramatic music) - Max, you may breathe, you may move. Stand up, leave the cabinet and follow me. This way Max. (dramatic music) (thunder clapping) - Oh no. (dramatic music) - [Vincent] Stop, stop Max, put this on. (dramatic music) Go back. (dramatic music) Stop. - No! Max. Somebody help, help somebody! Tony. - Maximilian oh great lover. Maximilian, Max the blubber. - Oh Max. (laughing) - Now you listen to me Max. You listen to me this time. You can think you are normal. - Let me down. let me off this silly thing. Vincent! - I'll let you down in time. You will be the first of her lovers to, of course, since Ralph and Leslie, they should be here. Don't go away. - [Max] Oh do come back. Marie, Tony, somebody, help! (thunder clapping) - You do respond to electricity in the air. There's a pRalphlem boy, a dangerous pRalphlem. Ralph, Leslie, you may move breathe, move walk. Follow me. (dramatic music) (thunder clapping) (dramatic music) Ralph and Leslie, just have a good seat. You're about to see the sideshow. Go down below. (dramatic music) - Black, Deen, what is this? - Nevermind that Mr. Haskell, get me down off this silly thing! - Right now. (dramatic music) - [Max] Watch out Mr. Haskell, watch out. - Look honey don't try anything funny with that knife. I don't want to hurt you. (dramatic music) Don't be foolish with that knife. Honey! Watch yourself. - Ralph, Leslie grab him. (dramatic music) Well it's unfortunate. And you Detective Haskell, you haven't been invited to our little party, but as long as you're here, you may witness the executions. - Listen you'll never get away with this Rinard. I got a man waiting outside. (laughing) - Shut up Max. Oh him, we'll take care of him later. Yes right now we're busy, we have to eliminate our pets. - You're sick, honestly. (yelling) You're sick. Maybe a little psychoanalysis would help. How about a year at Menages, would you like that? Maybe even five years I'll pay for the whole thing. (yells) Boy you are really sick. - But of course Max, aren't we all. Now let's not analyze me. Let's analyze your position. Slowly you will descend into this vat of molten wax. So. - Oh my God. (laughing) - Max shut up. (laughing) Stop it! Shut up! (laughing) Stop it Max. Stop it Max. Stop it Max. Stop it. (laughing) - I'm Max Black head of Paragon Studios. I made you head makeup artist, and I can make you so small again, where nobody will ever be able to find you. (laughing) - Stop it Max. (laughing) Stop it Max. (laughing) You stop Max, you stop it. You stop it Max. (laughing) (dramatic music) (laughing) (dramatic music) (laughing) (dramatic music) (laughing) (dramatic music) (phone ringing) (dramatic music) - [Marie] Vinny hello, Vinny darling, the party is tonight. Max is coming, I've decided to tell him we'll be married. I love you, I love you, I love you. (dramatic music) (soft sexy music) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (dramatic music)
