Pancakes? Uh no, crepes with strawberry jam. Yay! But you didn't know for sure that you were adopted until you were 63. That's right. Gram, we're leaving! Not 'til after my parents were dead. Give the cat some food before you go. We got a cat? No, come on. * All this time we spent * Waiting for our lives to happen * * This time has been wasted while the world * - * Keeps moving and changing - Sam, I know you're in there.

Come on, come on, enough. You don't think I see you, Scout Havers. You enroll Tallulah in school yet? It's complicated. It's not complicated. It's public school. You fill out a form, they take you. She really likes it here. This is a daycare center for two to four year olds. She is four. If Tallulah is four, I am the Queen of Shiba. And I don't see no crown sittin' on top of my head. Just for today, please. No, some of the other parents have been calling and complaining. I'm sorry. You have to go. Come on, Lulu. This is the window to your bathroom, right? Yep. Okay, so just go in and open the door and into your class, okay? Okay. Am I going to get into trouble? No, you're gonna be fine. But when you're done, instead of going out into the hall, just come back here, okay? Okay. Love you, Lulu. You too, Scout. The sea otter was almost hunted to extinction, their trusting nature making them an easy target for the fur traders. Doctor Arginow says that you absolutely must go to a real treatment center. I suppose you could always go to Mclarence. Pigeon. It's a mental institute, not a boarding school. They're used to people behaving badly. The food's horrendous there though. Some devoted mothers have been known to carry their pups for days, even after they have died. Of course, we could try something different. The Doctor thought you might like Prosper. Your father really loved it there. New York passenger, Sam Prescott, please meet your party at the baggage claim area. A Mr. Prescott, please meet your party at the baggage claim area. Mr. Prescott? Mr. Prescott? Mr. Prescott! * We are skin and bone * We are skin and bone * We are skin and bone We're supposed to paint our feelings. Fantastic. Why can't I go to school any more? Is it cause of the goldfish thing? What goldfish thing? I told you. Ms. McGintey got mad cause I was petting the gold fish. You didn't tell me that. You stuck your hand in the goldfish bowl? No stupid. You can't pet them in the bowl. They don't stay still. You gotta take em out. Fish die without water Lulu. Duh. Scout, what's that guy doing? Trying to escape from the looney bin. But he's not going anywhere. Don't tell him that. If they catch you, they're gonna give you a lobotomy. They stopped doing lobotomies in the 1980's. Toto, I don't think he's been to Texas before. Can we eat now? Are you okay? Yeah. I'm just waitin' for it to rain. I bet you know how to make it rain. People don't make it rain, silly. No. People make cookies. Sorry, that was kinda weird. Yeah well, you don't wanna end up on my side of the fence. They're not poisoned. Uh oh. Busted. Prescott. You should be ashamed of yourself. Now, if you'd read your rule book, you'd know these woods are off limits. And fraternizing with strangers is strictly forbidden. Page 65. Go ahead. Okay, Mr. Prescott. Next time, let's go some place it rains. Let's go. Prescott. That cookie, Prescott. Spit it out! My guest today, Tammy, had a tumor that grew, now you're not gonna believe this, to 275 pounds. Yes, you heard me correctly. A 275 pound tumor before she called the doctor and when the ambulance finally did arrive to pick her up, well they needed one for her and one for her leg. Now, Tammy, I gotta ask you, why didn't you call the doctor? I think like anyone, I was scared. Scared that they might... Hey, I was watchin' that. We need to get a birth certificate for Lulu. Oh no, I'm not havin' any of those busy body bureaucrats stickin' their nose in my business, no way. Well, I need to enroll her in public school and I can't without a birth certificate. I thought she liked daycare. She's too old for daycare. She has to go to real school now. So, send her to school. But I just told you, I can't without a birth certificate. If Lulu doesn't go to school, I can't either. Well, sure ya can. Just leave her at home here with me. What? I raised four kids in this house before you were even born. Gram, you had two children. Hmm, well, felt like four. Some more tea? You got it all over my new dress! How is it new? You've been wearing it for five... Hey Lulu, I gotta run, but I'll be back at noon to check on you, okay? Wait, Scout! Me and King Bochi don't have any cakes. Well, you and King Bochi must be blind. There are plenty of cakes. Don't you see em? Okay, love you Lulu! Sorry about my sister, your heiness. She's a little. There's gotta be cakes here somewhere. What else can I do ya for? I'll have an oreo milkshake with rainbow sprinkles and green gummies. You got it. Sorry about the weather. Guess you should have picked a looney bin in Seattle. Killer shoes though. You seem to normal to be at Prosper. You've caught me on a good week. There ya go. Anything else? Not unless you've got a pepto bismol I can bum. I don't think so. Shit, I gotta run. Thanks for lunch! Hey, wait! My boyfriend'll pay. But that's not a to-go cup. Lulu! I brought you a milkshake. Lulu? Gram? Are you playing hide and seek? Lulu? I'm gonna find you. King Bochi and I are gonna find you. Lulu? Lulu? Lulu, you have to come out now. It's not funny any more. Lulu! Hey, come here. That kid's still here? Yeah, I've been calling the number she gave us all night. No answer. No machine. You want me to call child welfare? Nah, I'll go talk to her. Is she okay? We had to pump her stomach, but she'll be fine. We've been calling that number that you gave us to talk to your family. But no one's answering. We've been staying with my great grandma. I'm sure she's there but, you know how old people are. Once she's asleep, I don't think an atomic bomb would wake her. Well tomorrow, we need a parent here when we release her. And someone to make payment. Not a problem. Okay. See, so this is what they used to do. They'd be buried under there. Like in the middle of there. Oh, so everyone would have to walk around it? Mmhmm! Egyptian boys and girls wore their hair in a style called sidewalks. Nobody knows why. Hey, how long do you think that guy's been sitting over there? Here. Be back in a second. So, are you a cop or a perv? Bureau of child welfare. Guess that makes you a bit of both. Are your parents at home? My Dad's at work. What time do you expect him back? Is there anyone over the age of 18 I can speak to? My great grandmother, but I doubt she's gonna wanna talk to you. Dial the number. There must be another way. Yeah, there is. You go to foster care. Aren't you the one that's saying the government should stay out of it... Dial the number, Scout. Will you dial the f'ing number please? Hello? Ray, it's Mary. Hey. You comin'? Who's that? Trouble. So, you gonna take em? He doesn't need to take us. All he has to do is put an appearance at BCW and it'll be fine. Scout, will you give us a moment alone here? Look, I know you don't wanna take us, okay? You can say it to my face. Do you want my help? Let me talk to your grandma alone for a minute. You're gonna take em right? Come on, for Christ sake. Mary, I'm... I'm a f'in carnie, ain't no way to raise a kid. It's a little late for that. Or are you gonna abandon this one too? What was that joke Janie used to like to tell? What do ya get when ya put 20 carnies in a room together? A full set of teeth. She loved to tell that joke. Can we stay focused here? He's got A.D.D. Is that what ya call it? This smells pretty. They give you money and food stamps and stuff for takin' care of em, don't they? Every month. I know a guy who will buy food stamps for cash. Maybe this way, we can afford that nice apartment you keep promising me for the winter. You couldn't pay me a million dollars to live in a 10 by five shit hole with a moody teenager. Can't breathe as it is. Well maybe we could just take the little one. She don't need much room. Hey, I want you to run to the store and get your Gram a Coke. She ain't gonna drink it unless you got some rum to put in there. Do you ever do what you're told? Depends who's doin' the tellin'. Um, your father. The only fathering you ever did was gettin' my Mom knocked up. Sorry, I don't think that's much of a parenting skill. Lulu, come here. Go to the store. Get a Coke. You gonna talk to BCW? Yeah, we already worked it out. Well, you wanna tell me the plan then? When you get back. This is my life. Yeah, ya know what, and everybody else's too. Go get the f'in Coke. Hey! Hey! What the hell are you doing? Scout! Wait! Scout! Scout! Oh shit. Shit! Shit. Now, the foster family that's taking you is very nice. Yeah? When was the last time you said to some kid the foster family that's taking you totally sucks, so just pull yourself together 'cause the next four years of your life are gonna be pure hell? What about my great grandmother, huh? She going to foster care too? She sure as hell can't take care of herself. Can I say goodbye? * It's the first defeat * That cuts you to your bone * Knock you off your feet * You just never felt home * It's not a person or place * But a feeling you can't Gram, I'm going. Someone from Visiting Nurses is gonna come by and check on you. Try not to burn the house down. I love you. * This will be the last time * This will be the last time * This will be the last time * You take me Hey. You ready to break outta this joint for real? Go on a road trip? How did you get up here? I brought you some clothes in case you're getting tired of the whole bathrobe look. They're kinda lame but wait. Tada! It's a raincoat. Listen, we can get you new ones. Okay, you don't have to come if you don't want to. Send you a postcard. Besides, you'd be missing out on some really great events here. Come on Ray, pick up. Got a drivers license? I bet you're one of those cat people. You know, those cat lovers who go to all the shows and stuff. He hates cats. Yeah, my mother died and left me this sweater. Aww, I'm so sorry. Yeah well, she could've left me a house. Or a car. Thank you. Alright, all I need is a drivers license and credit card please. I don't have a credit card but... No credit card? No, I got a license. You're staying at the most expensive mental institute and you don't have a credit card? Can we pay cash? That's a good one. Everybody knows you can't rent a car without a credit card. Do you have a ladies room I can use or do I need a credit card for that too? Yes, we do. It's right over there. Thanks. * Some people call me crazy * Spin round and round * I just say whoopsie daisy * Then come unwound 'Scuse me. Hello, how can I help you? Which kind of car would you like? Sure, sure, no problem. Just a moment, let me look into that. Mmhmm, I'll get that for you right away. Well, I'm not sure. Sure. Are you crazy? That's your department, remember? Get in before she sees us! Get in the car! Alright then. Thank you. We'll see you at 12:00 noon. Come on! Just drive. Drive! Oh! Oh no, no, no! No! 'Scuse me. I have a rental car that's being stolen. The corner of I don't know what I was thinking. We needed a car. Yeah great, now you can add grand theft auto to your resume. We're just like Bonnie and Clyde. No, we're just like dumb and dumber. Do you want me to drop you off at the pawn store? No. What'd happened to you then? I don't know. I'd hitchhike, I guess. Yeah great, then you'd end up duct taped to death in the back of a van. You wanna drive? No. It might look better if the person with the license is the one actually doing the driving. I'm not much of a driver. Wanna try? No. Is your Mom really dead? No. She's not. Hey, clothes store. You keep a lookout, okay? Come on, let's go, let's go! Hey! No. Lighten up soldier. Think it looks pretty good. I mean, what if somebody sees us? Who? Why did you, ya know? There must have been a reason. A girl? Money problems? Sorry, I don't mean to pry. Just never met anyone that killed themself on purpose before. I lost all hope. All hope of what? All hope of anything. That's not possible. What's not possible? To lose all hope. I mean, you might have hoped to be dead but, it's still a hope. Pretty shitty hope. Just sayin'. No, it's actually kind of like the worst. Hope. Must have been a bummer when you weren't. Yeah, I guess. Was it bloody? Shit, duck. Where are we going? To get my sister back. Will you help? Yeah. Goodnight. All my children have left me one time or another. No reason why Scout should be any different. You don't think she's a little young to be? Scout? Scout's as old as the hills. And this boy. You ever see him with your great granddaughter? Well, he don't look familiar. Yeah, New York boy. So, you have no idea where... Now, didn't you already ask me that question? I had a talk with the waitress at Lynn's. Said she saw em together. Never trust a man who won't drink with ya. Wish I could. What's retirement? Crystal had her first baby at 12 after being raped by her father. She ran away from home. Well, if you hear from anyone. Oh well, Scout won't call here. She's too smart for that. Yeah well. I don't suppose you're a smoker huh? Lungs are a terrible thing to waste. Past tense. Already did. Might as well enjoy it now. Yeah, might as well. Good evening, ma'am. F'in bureaucrat. Stuff started happening. The hitting, the kicking, it's just always been a part of my life. The sexual abuse? That started when I was eight. So, here you are with two unwanted children by this man, your father. Where did you get the courage? My Mom and Dad needed some privacy. Psst. Hey. When I was pregnant with my second baby, my father attacked me with a kitchen knife. I blacked out. I was in the hospital with over 100 stitches. It was the people in the hospital that convinced me to go get help, go to a shelter. Weren't you scared? Yes. Every day, I walk out my door. How do you watch that shit? It's educational. The beloved classic, To Kill A Mockingbird, went on to garner three Academy awards, including the only best actor Oscar for Gregory Peck - as Atticus Finch. - Hey look, it's you. His young co-star, Mary Badham, who gives a beautifully... What? ...nuance performance as Scout. Isn't that what you're named after? No. Scout Willis. Demi Moore's kid? Demi Moore, the actress? No, Demi Moore, the Senator. Me and Tallulah both. My Mom worshipped her. People used to say they could have been twins. I guess she thought if Demi Moore could make it outta the trailer park, so could she. Did she? No. Not the way she intended to. It's hard to make it outta the trailer park when you're a junkie. Do you think I look like her? Demi Moore? Well, the asshole disconnected his phone, but the lady at the Ryder office says the carnival's gonna be in Clayton next. You hungry? Yeah, I got a little money in the car. You've got money? A little. Why didn't you tell me? You thought I was gonna steal it from you. I was just saving it for an emergency. Well, please let me know when we reach emergency status. Can I have the keys? We don't need your precious money. Though an untimely end to Amy the Armadillo, she will no longer be the mascot of the school. But, we hope that... Go ask the clerk for some condoms. Just keep them distracted. Look, I can get money. That's no fun. Go! Hey, could I get some condoms? Well, here's one from the only in-Texas files. Teenage girl walks into a west Texas car rental company, but when the clerk refuses to rent her a car, she slips out the back and steals one. Oh, the police say the girl in question has dyed her hair pink, so that should make her a little bit easier to spot. If you know anything, they're looking for a 2008 dark blue sedan that was pretty serious... Just hang on. Hey, don't you want any of these? You made me pull them all down for nothin'. Hey! Asshole. Who you callin' asshole man? Just go, don't worry about it. Hey, you're that girl. The one that stole the car, that's you. Put the phone down. Hey, find something to tie him up with. Yeah. Sit down. Sit down, face the wall. Sit down, give me the phone. Give me your hands. That the front key? Yeah. Go get the car. You were pretty cool back there. You know that? Hey, can we just pull over a second? Right here? Yeah. Woah, hey! Hey! Hey, come here! Come here! Sam, come here! It's this thing, I saw it on Faith Price once. Just lie down and put your head on my chest. Just try it. Listen to my heart beat, okay? You'll probably go to hell for that, ya know? Coloring over the Virgin Mary. Bet that's where your Mom is. You listening to me? My Mom is dead. My point exactly. Yeah, nothin' serious, but if you see her, just give me a shout out here. And here's a little somethin' for you. Thank you. Hey baby! You comin' back in here soon? Yeah, I'll be right there. Alright. Thank you. Okay, like the lady on the phone said, they're gonna be in Clayton on September 2nd. We should be able to get there by then. Alright. What are you doing? What's funny? Nothing. Didn't your mother teach you it's rude to Google? It wasn't right to Google people? Wanna give me that thing? You know, there's this guy, Vlad the Impaler and they base Dracula off him. Anyways, he used to have these picnics when he was surrounded by like hundreds, I mean hundreds of his victims and they'd just have like these spikes stuck up through their bodies and they'd bleed to death as he ate his lunch. Or breakfast or ya know. You and Lulu are gonna make a great pair. Are you sure she's better off, ya know, living with me? You know, I mean, you don't know how crazy I am. Yeah, trust me. You're a lot less crazy than my Dad. He's nuts. Totally nuts. And nasty. He's kinda like that guy from the oil movie. What oil movie? Ya know, he'll drink her milkshake. Oh, you've seen that? Yeah. If you keep doin' that, you're gonna throw up. What about your Dad? Is he crazy too? Yeah, he was. What do you mean? He died. How? He was in this mental institution and he stole the director's car and drove it off a cliff. I think someone's following us. It's been following us basically since we left the taco truck. Pull over. Is that it? Yep. Guess they're not following us any more. We should find a hotel. A hotel? Did we strike oil? I don't think it's a good idea to live out of the car any more. Wow. Sorry, didn't hear you guys. Hey, look it's your book. It's like his bible. Yeah, it's pretty good. Guess that's why I didn't hear you guys. Have you gotten up to the part with TJ Eckleburg? Eckleburg, the eyes of Dr. Eckleburg. Are blue and gigantic, their retinas. Okay Shakespeare, you can stop. He just got out of solitary. Uh, so you read the Great Gatsby in jail? Yeah, death row. So, we gonna start a book club or can we get a room? Sure, sorry. Is that gonna be one room or two? He just spent three years in jail. What do you think? My sister and I can share. Alright, just need a signature and a credit card and you'll be good to go. Oh, I don't actually have a credit card at the moment. But, I could pay for the whole thing upfront, if that's okay. Room 414. Were you really in jail? My sister and I can share? What did you want me to say? You liked her. Admit it. You thought she was cute. She is cute. If you like bimbo's. She's reading The Great Gatsby. I doubt she's a bimbo. You should ask her out. Why? You just called her a bimbo. You're a guy. You're supposed to like bimbo's. Wow. You think you could live here? After we get Lulu? Yeah. Yeah, you could be like Eloise from Lubbock. Who's Eloise? Another one of your bimbo's? No, she's um, she's this girl that lives at the Plaza hotel. She's fictional. A lot of your friends are fictional. Yeah, I mean, they're better than real people. Thanks. No, not you, I mean. You're different. Hello? He's not here right now. It's the bimbo. If we stay, she has got to go. See? Told ya. Small town, nothin' to do. So, this is how we amuse ourselves. Wow, I don't... wow, how does that even work? There's something in the soil from the plant that just makes it light up. Drink! Got it? Can't believe that you're really into The Great Gatsby. You're really obsessed with that book, aren't you? I didn't mean that in a bad way. It's nice. In school, we had to go around and say which character we identified with the most. I bet you'd choose Nick. No. I was more like the son that Gatsby and Daisy never had. And I'd be what's left after she was finished destroying him. That's really sad. Is it always this empty around here? Pretty much. You're not exactly in the center of the universe. Especially this time of year. It's a bit claustrophobic, don't you think? You okay? It's about time. Bonehead. Scout Havers? Hey look, Melinda, I'm really sorry. You said that already. Yeah, well. Yeah. Scout. Scout. Shit. 'Scuse me, have you seen this girl that I've been with? She's like this tall. She's blonde. No, I haven't seen anybody. Well, has anybody else checked in today? I'm not supposed to tell you that. Hey! You can't do that. Ren Preston, 506. Scout. Where is she? Hi Sam. Where is she? She's fine. Oh fine? Yeah, it was either that or put a muzzle on her. Look what she did to my arm. Your mother wants to talk with you. Well, my mother can go to hell. Hey Sam. Do you know how many laws you've broken? Look, I don't need a babysitter. Just talk with her. Okay but, can we go somewhere else? Just downstairs or something? Okay. It's so desperately hot. Why does the power always have to go off on the hottest day of the year. Oh, I'm sorry. Where were we? The word for when you wanna kill your own child. Abortion. No, no, no, no, umm... matricide. Babycide. Sam. Oh, speaking of children. Pigeon. Do you know how absolutely distraught I've been? Maria. Oh sweetheart. You can't just keep running around the country breaking the law. It's uncouth. Is that all you give a shit about, how it looks? 'Cause you really didn't seem to mind when Dad was losing his mind. Pigeon, you don't really mean that. Oh, no of course. I'm sorry. Having a crazy son's nowhere near as romantic as having a crazy husband. Pigeon? Have you been drinking? She wants to talk to you. Yeah? You've gotta help me here. I just. Just a minute. You okay? I'm just feeling a little nauseous. You didn't stop taking your medication? Red, I'll be right back. I'll be right back. Alright. I guess he went to the restroom. Yeah, he said he's a little nauseous. Hey hey, you okay? Look, we only have five minutes together. So I need you to be calm, okay? You know this asshole? Yeah, he kinds works for us. You've got to be kidding. No, I'm not. He used to be a Texas ranger and then, he was put in the psych ward next to my Dad. So that's who's been following us, someone that works for you? Hey, did you see the bite mark I gave him? Yeah, nice one Mike Tyson. Alright, come on. Sam? Son of a bitch. Hey, can you help me pack? Yeah. Sure. What happened to this room anyway? Your friend attacked me. Oh yeah? With cookies and mini bottles? You know how in the beginning of Cinderella, all those little mice and things come and help her? You should see those suckers drink. You're crazy. That's why you like me. Okay Cinderella. Cookie if you want it. Damn it! Shit. Careful. No, no, no, can't take the car. No, we can't take the car. Come on. Sam! Have you ever been in love? Yeah. Once. What happened? She was a goldfish. No, I don't know. She didn't love me back. Didn't work out. She was an idiot. Yeah. I guess so. We should get married. No, we really shouldn't. Besides, it's been like what? 24 hours since we've broken any laws? No. I'm serious. No, I'm serious. You're 15 and drunk. I'm not drunk! I'm serious! No, you're really... Hey, I'm serious. No. I'm serious, you're 15 and you're wasted. I'm not wasted. Yeah you are, I saw like a thousand mini bottles in the hotel room. You have no sense of adventure. Ray loves to claim he's not my real father. Sure as hell hope he's right. You know what their favorite place to aim is? The balls. He has to wear all this protective gear and stuff so he doesn't get hurt. Ladies and gentlemen, step right up! Can we live in New York after we get Lulu? What, with my Mom? No, definitely not with your Mom. She probably lives in some big, fancy building right? Yeah, 76th and 5th. It overlooks the park. The East Village. I've always wanted to live there. Sure. Sure, but you gotta go to school though. I hate school. You hate school? I hate school! Jesus, school's great. School's great. You get an education. Ya make friends. Do drugs? Have sex? We'll be just like a normal family. Yeah. It'll be nice. Yeah. Okay, we need to find Ray's trailer. Wanna look down here? Yeah. I mean, should we be looking for anything, like shitty decorations maybe? I don't know. I've never been to his carnival before. I bet you that one's his. Real welcoming. Come on. Well, his junkie girlfriend's in there, but I don't see Lulu. I'm gonna go around front. You stay here and keep watch, okay? Your head is backwards. I don't care! Lulu! Oww! Lulu! Lulu, are you okay? No. I'm dead. Why didn't you put me on a milk carton, Scout? Maybe somebody would have found me. I did find you, Lulu. Now I'm gonna take you home. Come out and talk to me, okay? I can't. It's my punishment. Come out here please and talk. What happened to your hair? Tallulah? You talkin' to somebody? King Bochi. King Bochi? He's my stuffed dog. There ain't no stuffed dog out here. That's because Daddy made me leave him with Gram. But I can still talk to him. K, well talk to him a little more quietly. You're givin' me a headache. Shit Lulu. You're all banged up. Come on, let's get outta here. Hey Tallulah, you under the trailer again? I got a new one for ya. What do you call the red gooey stuff that gets between the toes of the elephant at the circus? The slow clown. Well, look what the cat dragged in. You disconnected your phone. Have you been hitting her? Nah. It's a rough and tumble world, Scout. Tallulah, come on out from under there. Come on. Say goodbye to your sister. But she just got here. Yep and now she's leaving. She said I was going with her. No, you're not going anywhere. You come around here again, I'm gonna get the cops after you. Yeah and if your druggie girlfriend lays another finger on her... Leave Georgia outta this! She saw the Virgin Mary once on the side of a 14-wheeler. That's really tragic. It's not a joke. She saw God. Go on! Thing like that'll mess you up for life. Living with you would mess you up for life! Goodbye Scout! Why did you even take her? You don't want her! Goodbye. Hey! Walk away! Shit. Hey. Hey. Hey. It's okay. I got a plan, alright? It's fine. Red, it's Ray. Ray from the carnival. Get the red, get the red. Yeah! Hello. Georgie Russert? Yeah? John Forest, Jesus for Me and You magazine. I'm doing an article on people who have seen the Virgin Mary and I was hoping to include you. You're shittin' me, right? You're like a rock star at the magazine. So, this is like that show where Ed McMahon comes to your door? Except... without the giant check thing? I'm just thinking I could take a few pictures. Maybe ask you a few questions. Would that be okay? Okay! Wonderful. Alright, I'll just be over there. Okay, I'll come over there. You stay in here so you don't mess everything up. Okay. And don't make so much noise all the time. My goodness! Look at you! Wow. You look A okay. You look miraculous. Thank you. Wow. I can't believe it. Okay, so first off, I'm just thinking, maybe some prayer? Okay. Is that Mary? Face Mary this way. I'm gonna just talk to Jesus right now. Okay. Beautiful. Did I not tell you that you're gonna be the cover? The cover! The cover. Oh my God. Isn't this unbelievable. Oh my gosh, this is crazy. You have no idea how much of a rock star you are. I can't wait to tell Ray. Who's Ray? Ray is my fiance. Oh so, actually now that I think about it, do you maybe wanna change your outfit? Because you're gonna be on the cover, anything that should show your true colors? I'm gonna go put on my Miracle at Smiley shirt. Okay? You'll stay right here? I will. I'm gonna be famous! You are. Alright here, we haven't got long. Give me this. Jump on my back. Alright, I got ya. Lulu? Lulu! This way, this way, come on. Sam. Lulu. Sam! Oh shit. Lulu? Ray. Sam! Sam! No, you guys go this way. Put her down. Scout! Move! Move! You can't go in there without a ticket. I need a ticket! I need a ticket! 'Scuse me, 'scuse me. Come on. Sorry. I'm sorry. 'Scuse me. I'm sorry, ma'am. Hey! Watch the front. There's no other way for them to get outta here! We've got it covered. Sam? Scout? Come on, get in, get in. What now? Down that hole. Here, you guys make a run for it, I'll keep him distracted. Give me the gun. We're not leaving you here. Give me the gun. I'll keep him distracted. I'll meet you at the bus stop at 8:00, alright? Give me the gun. Sam? Come on out. Lulu, put your legs down. You got her? Yep, here, come here. Alright, come on. I will sit here until the cows come home, Scout! The bus stop, you'll be there, you promise? I'll be there, I promise. If you're not there, I'm gonna kill you. Love you too. Alright? Alright, come on Lulu. I'm going. Sam! Scout! Come on out. Sam, drop the gun. Drop the gun, Sam. Okay? Just drop the gun. Come on now. Come on. Drop the gun. Alright. You sure made a mess of things this go round. I mean, I wouldn't wanna disappoint my mother. God knows what she'd do without a mess. They're holding you on a $10,000 bail, but they're gonna drop the charges if you promise you'd go back to New York with her. I'm not going back to New York. That's not happening. If you don't, they're gonna bring those two girls in. The younger one will go back with her father. The other'll be sent to juvie. But they've got nothing to do with this. It's not a perfect world. Whatever, if I go back to New York, will you take care of them? I don't know if your mother will... Ray. Okay yeah, I'll make it happen. Thank you. I wish you and your Dad could have gotten to know each other better. I think you would've been able to help him a lot more than I did. He's not coming. Scout? Are you okay? You're making it easier. Thank you. Pigeon. Who always rescues you when you need help? Red is taking care of your friend. This might be hard to believe, but I was actually taking care of my friend. Don't be ridiculous, Pigeon. You can't take care of yourself, let alone anyone else. What were you planning to do? Spend the rest of your life on the run? I wasn't on the run. You ready? Hey, you remember what I asked? I got ya covered. You take care of yourself, alright? Thank you. You're welcome. Shh. Can you stop that? There's nothing to do here. Why can't we go back to Gram's? Because we can't, okay? Can we play dressup? Whatever. Okay, we need to find 76th and 5th. Come on. Which one should we try? How about that one. Okay. We're looking for Sam Prescott. Mr. Prescott doesn't live here any more. But he did? Did he leave a forwarding address or? Would you like me to ring up Mrs. Prescott? Nevermind. Does that woman ever go out? Scout? What? Can we go now? I'm hungry. You're always hungry. It's dinner time. Soon, okay? Oh my God! That was his Mom! Come on, come on! Hey, wait. Okay, let's go. Lulu. Lulu, get away from the window. Scout, look. It's him! The looney bin guy. He's sitting right there at the table. There are some things I need to talk to you about. He's smiling. Pigeon? Oh my God, it's that girl. Why didn't you tell me she's in New York? I didn't know. Sam, where are you going? Sam? - Hey. - Hi! Tallulah, welcome. You want me to take that? * I went out in the rain suddenly everything changed * * They're spreading blankets on the beach * * Yours is the first face that I saw * * I think I was blind before I met you * * Now I don't know where I am * I don't know where I've been * But I know where I want to go * * And so I thought I'd let you know * * That these things take forever * * I especially am slow * But I realize that I need you * * And I wondered if I could come home * * Remember the time you drove all night * * Just to meet me in the morning * * And I thought it was strange you said everything changed * * You felt as if you'd just woke up * * And you said this is the first day of my life * * I'm glad I didn't die before I met you * * But now I don't care I could go anywhere with you * * And I'd probably be happy * So if you want to be with me * With these things there's no telling * * We just have to wait and see * But I'd rather be working for a paycheck * * Than waiting to win the lottery * * Besides maybe this time is different * * I mean I really think you like me *
