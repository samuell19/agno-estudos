Hobie, you're joshing me again. No, I ain't, Miss June. Everyone of them fence posts took root and started to grow. This old boy turned his cows loose and went into the timber business. Made a fortune too. Sold your uncle these very posts. Well, there's a lot of fence on the Teton Ranch. I must say that. Wiping your nose on a hoop. [SIGHS] Just ain't no end to it. I still say the feller invented this stuff ought to been hung with it. You don't like fences, do you, Hobie? Uh, can't say I do. But your uncle does, he owns this ranch. I just draw wages a-riding his fence. So, uh, could be I'm wrong. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Ride. Get out of here. Quick! Ride! [COWS MOOING] Wire cutters. That's mighty big game you were hunting. That girl was Sam Brassfield's niece. You make Sam Brassfield sound awful tall. He is. Well, we better get moving. We're still a long way from Cheyenne. You. When I start a job, I finish it. You wait. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [WHINNYING] MAN: Ride him, Webb! [LAUGHS] Cross your fingers, Johnny.They'll be crossed. Let's go. Hyah. Hyah. MAN: Take it easy, there, boy. Attaboy. Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! [MEN CHEERING] [LAUGHING] Look at him go. Ride him, vaquero. [CHEERING] [GRUNTS] [MEN LAUGHING] Don't worry, Webb. We'll make a cowhand out of you yet. [LAUGHS] [GRUNTS] [SOBBING] Uncle, it's Hobie. He was showing me around and a group of masked riders-- Sis, what is it? What's wrong? Get Ruth. Go on. It's okay. Come on, honey. Come on. [JUNE SOBBING] Here, now. What they been doing to you? This poor child's on the verge of hysterics. Shh. Just calm down now and Ruth's gonna take care of you. Shh. You poor little thing. Come on. Off we go. So it's started up again. I didn't know it ever stopped. Get Johnny Quatro and start saddling up. And Webb? You won't need that gun you've been so anxious to wear. Johnny's gonna take this mighty hard. Hobie was his best friend. I know. If these were the days when Johnny and you and me was riding-- They're not, Ed. I'll meet you at the barn. Yeah. Sorry, Johnny. Sure, senor Sam, I know. [COWS MOOING] Abe Clevenger and the homesteaders. It had to be-- I don't know Abe Clevenger did it. And neither do you. You saw that fence. That's the sixth time it's been cut. Now one of our best hand's dead. What are you gonna do? Let 'em get away with it? I'm not gonna let them force the Teton Ranch into a range war. Johnny, they've got an hour's start on you. It'll be days before you can hope to catch up with them. Hobie was my friend. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [HOOFBEATS APPROACHING] Johnny. Glad you thought it over. If there'd been any chance at all, don't you think I'd have come along? In the old days I would have kept on riding until I caught up with them. To hell if I had to. But now I guess my job is here. You share all the troubles, Johnny. I wish you and Ed would share the rest. Partners? I don't think so. You both deserve it. It's not for Ed. He likes being foreman. And you? Johnny Quatro? [CHUCKLES] He likes wings on his shoulders so he can fly wherever he wants to go. Where is it you want to go, Johnny? Right here. How's June? Sleeping, I hope. That poor child having to see a thing like that. Sometimes I wish she'd never come to this godforsaken country. There wasn't much choice. Oh, Sam, I-I didn't mean that. You've been like a father to those two kids. A lot more father than they ever had in the first place. You and Ed take care of the funeral arrangements for Hobie. I'm going into Cheyenne. I'll leave first thing in the morning. [ROOSTER CROWS] [DOOR OPENS] Well, I... I've put some bacon and coffee and biscuits in your saddle roll. I have to stop by and talk to Harry Travers for a minute. Give our love to Sharleen. Do you know how long you'll be gone? I doubt that I'll be in Cheyenne more than one night. The place will be in an uproar with President Arthur's special train stopping there. Be careful, won't you? With the President of the United States? I won't bother him. And I'll bring you a present from Cheyenne. [CHUCKLES] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] He said he was camping out in the Wind Rivers tonight. I-I sure wish I could shake the feeling I got. There's something in the wind. I heard it in the coyote's howl last night. [DRAMATIC MUSIC ] [HENS CLUCKING] [COMICAL MUSIC] Stupid. Idiot. SAM: I heard what you said. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Well, now, that's a pretty sneaky thing to do, coming up on my blind side. And can't you just once come by when I'm looking decent? You look pretty decent to me. [GRUNTS] Why don't you let Harry do the wrangling? You're much too pretty to be doing a man's work. Why, Sam, that's the nicest thing you ever said to me. Is it? I thought I told you once I liked your cooking. Oh. Do you what I like most about you? Well, I've been waiting for you to tell me. You're the only wrangler I ever knew who smelled sweet even in the corral. You know the thing I like about you? You always say such romantic things. [CHUCKLES] Now, what brings you by this fine day? There's been some trouble, Sharleen. Not Harry? No. Hobie Renton was killed yesterday. Oh, no. Hobie? Shot down. Fence-cutters again. Sam, what do they want? What are they trying to do? I can't prove it, but they've got a big stake. A fenced trail, 10 to 15 miles wide running all the way from Texas up to this country. It'd handle a million cattle. They need our grass. Hmm. Maybe it's a good idea they-- they offered to lease a lot of small ranches, like ours. Do you think opening up this range and overstocking it with scrub Texas cattle is going to prove anything? I don't know, Sam. I only know that Harry thinks it's a good thing. Where is Harry? He went to Cheyenne, day before yesterday. To see Clay Mathews, huh? Well, why shouldn't he? Clay Mathews is a mighty convincing man. I'd like to talk to Harry before Mathews makes up his mind for him. Don't you think Harry has a mind of his own? You don't really want me to answer that, do you? Oh, Sam, he's trying so hard. He-- He hasn't had a drink in over two months, and I just don't want to do anything to upset him. He's 40 years old. Well, he's still my brother. You can't go on covering up for him forever. Look, Sharleen, Mathews doesn't care anything about your brother. He doesn't care about this country. All he wants to do is sell cattle, strip the country clean and run. What do you want to do, Sam Brassfield? Do you own a ranch? You wanna sell cattle? I thought you knew what I wanted. We've talked about it often enough. I've always thought of the Teton as a-- A future for you, me, June and Webb. Don't you think my brother is entitled to a future too? And how do you know Clay Mathews isn't right? Oh, Sam, can't you see Harry's side of it? I can't see where Harry has any side. You'll never change. Do you really want me to change? No, Sam, I don't want you to change, not one little bit. Not ever. [ROMANTIC MUSIC ] Where do you think you're going? With you. Who invited you? I did. Look, Johnny, all I'm going to do is talk to the Cattlemen's Association. I'll only be in Cheyenne one night. Senor Sam, you told me not to go looking for the man who killed Hobie. You're the boss. I do what you say. But you gotta keep on telling me. If you don't, I stay here, alone. Maybe I forget. Anyway, long time since we've been in Cheyenne together. Big city, it's good to have a friend around. You might get in trouble. You're worrying about me getting into trouble? That's a new one. You mean I'd better go with you, no? I mean, I haven't got time to argue with you. Come on. If Ed were around, it would be just like old times. Well, I hope you don't get into as much trouble as you used to in those old times. Why are you always picking on me? I never saw you missing out on anything. It'll sure be good to see Cheyenne again. [LAUGHS] You remember that senorita in Dodge City? Heh. Where'd you dig that one up? I didn't dig her up. She was my cousin. Man, have you got a lot of cousins. Ay, Chihuahua. Que lindathose cousins. [SPEAKING IN SPANISH] Ah, what do you want now? Do you think when we get to Cheyenne maybe we we see our Presidente of the United States? Look, if you don't shut up and go to sleep you're not going to see anybody, because I'm gonna bat you right over the head. Si, senor. Ay, Chihuahua. Chester A. Arthur, the Presidente of the whole United States. [PIANO PLAYING] [CLANKING] SAM: We can tie up here. The Cheyenne Club will take care of our horses. Sure you won't stay at the Club with me? I can get you a room. No, this place is too fancy for Johnny Quatro. Too fancy, or not enough girls? Well, uh, maybe I go see one girl I happen to know. Cousin? Yes. My cousin. Yeah, I-I'm thirsty. Uh-- Maybe I go find a little tequila. Give me. Ah, senor Sam. Give me. Just because one time I had a little tequila. Three fingers in a washtub. Come on, give me. That time in Dodge City, the other fellow started it. Oh, you're still mad about that time in Abilene? I was only having fun. Everybody else was shooting out the lights. Yeah, give me. Oh, senor Sam. You never want me to have any fun. I want you to stay alive. Need any money? Like you say, ha, ha. Give me. [BOTH CHUCKLE] Hey. [SLURRING] What the devil is that thing? What's it doing in the Cheyenne Club? Well, a Holstein bull, sir. Painted by a very famous Dutch artist. That's a bull? I ain't never seen a polka dot critter like that on any range I ever rode. Holstein are milk cattle, sir. Milk? [ALL LAUGH] Well, that'll hold it. A critter like that get loose it could chase all the decent cattle clear out of Wyoming. Milk. Bah! Country's going to the devil. Good for you, John. What we want in this country is Texas cattle. Whoo! [ALL LAUGH] We'll have them too. I've got every Southern Senator and Congressman backing me solid. When the Government gives away a million acres of land to the railroads, how're they gonna argue over a little strip of land that'd let us drive cows from Texas to Canada? It'll bring a lot of cattle into this country. And no doubt about that. That's what I like about you, Travers. You're a man that sees an opportunity. [BOTH CHUCKLE] Did you talk to Abe Clevenger? Oh, well, uh. Ahem. He's not a man you can push right into something, you know. Well, of course not. No man worth his salt is. Well, Mr. Mathews... Clay. Uh, I might as well tell you. Uh, the smaller outfits are worried about Sam Brassfield. Oh, I don't mean Abe Clevenger. He hates Brassfield and all the rest of the Cattlemen's Association. But if it was to come down to a fight-- And it's gonna come down to a fight. If Sam Brassfield keeps cutting his own fences and blaming it on his neighbors. Oh, I'm-- I'm on your side, Clay. You know that. Tell me, Harry. How does your sister feel about all this? My sister doesn't run my ranch. I do. Remember Harry, when I'm talking about getting range, I'm talking about paying for it. It's you and your friends and nesters like Abe Clevenger I'm interested in cutting in, not the big land-grabbing outfits. SAM: Like me, for example? MATHEWS: Sam. Ha, ha. You old cow thief, you. How about a little Texas lightning to wash the dust out of your gullet? Don't mind if I do. Harry. Uh, Sam. I stopped by your place. Sharleen said you were here in Cheyenne. Oh, I-I had some, uh, some pressing business. So I see. Thanks for the drink, Clay. Like old times. That's right. I've known Sam Brassfield a long time. Now, don't you and the rest of the boys up there let him shove you around. Why, he don't shove me around. Nobody does. You're gonna be an important man, Harry. Real important. [EXHALES] [COUGHS] [SIGHS] [KNOCKING] Door's open. Sam. You're getting to be a big man, Sam. I own some land. Yeah, with a fence around it. That's right. There're getting to be too many fences for me, Sam. My business depends on open range. Well, then, maybe you ought to change your business, Clay. No, Sam, I don't see it that way. The way I see it, as soon as this National Cattle Trail Bill passes, my business will just be starting. I don't expect it to pass. I'm doing everything I can to stop it. Well, that kind of puts us on different sides of this fence I was talking about, don't it? You could say that. Sam, I don't wanna fight with you. I think a lot of you. Do you remember that first day you come to work for me down in the Brush Country? I remember it. Just back from the war, your land gone, your folks dead. You were some green, boy, but you learned fast. You trying to say something, Clay? Well, I figured you might still learn fast. I'm offering you a chance to put in with me, Sam. I figure you know the answer. You're being a fool, boy. That's possible. Sam, we're friends. I taught you a lot about the cow business. You think I'd go into this if I didn't know what I was doing? I've got a million dollars in back of me. [SIGHS] You have a lot of cattle in Texas, Clay. Wyoming is the last spot on earth you have to sell them. You're a man between a rock and a hard place looking for a way out. Alright, Sam. Suppose what you say is true. I'll still make a million dollars. Any reason why you shouldn't be a part of it? Yeah, plenty of reason, Clay. But I doubt you'd understand it. I know why you're in town, Sam. And so do a lot of the small ranchers in your part of the country. You come in here to yell to your Cattlemen's Association. They start sending in hired guns there, calling them range detectives. You got it all wrong, Clay. I came here to tell the Cattlemen's Association to stay out of this. Anybody wants trouble, they'll have it with me. Sam, I hate to see this happening to you. A lot of your neighbors don't like the stand you're taking. They figure you're getting in the way of something good. That why my fences are being cut? One of my hands killed? I couldn't say. But Harry Travers and Abe Clevenger got an idea that you know more about that fence-cutting than anybody. You the one put that idea in their heads? You saying I might be? When I know for sure, I won't stand here talking about it. I guess we know where we stand. That's right. We know. [TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING] I reckon that must be the President's train. I reckon it must be. [BAND PLAYING UPBEAT THEME] [CROWD CHEERING] My fellow Americans. Thank you. Thank you, indeed, for this true Western hospitality. On this occasion of my visit to the scenic splendor that is Yellowstone National Park, I am indeed humbled in the presence of the vastness of this land. [BAND PLAYING UPBEAT THEME] [CROWD CHEERING] [GUNSHOTS] Son of a gun. The Presidente of the United States. Gentlemen, the President of the United States. [APPLAUDING] Clay Mathews, Mr. President. It's a great pleasure, Mr. Mathews. Thank you, sir. [CHATTER] Gentlemen, uh, I, uh-- I should not even discuss the subject of the, uh, genus bovine in a gathering of the finest cattlemen in our United States. But in order that you may not suppose me completely ignorant of the subject, I would like to observe that this is the first ventilated bull it's been my privilege to see. [ALL LAUGH] Mr. President, my name is Clancy from the Cheyenne Daily Leader. Can I have a statement from you, sir, as to your feelings about the National Cattle Trail? I'm in Wyoming to visit Yellowstone National Park. This evening is a purely social function with no political overtones whatsoever. And, uh, you may quote me. [ALL CHUCKLE] Yes, Mr. President. Mr. President, here in Wyoming we do things like we do back home in Texas. We go whole hog. We didn't want you to get the idea that we were all heathens in this part of the country. Mr. Mathews, if I ever had any such preconceived notion, I assure you, it's being rapidly dispelled. This is just potluck, Mr. President. We don't want you to make any speeches or grant any favors.Good. Good. We wanted to give you a chance to put your legs under a table and wrap yourself around some good old Texas beef. Believe me, I'll be delighted. Right this way, sir. [CHATTER] MATHEWS: Ha, ha. So the next morning w-we got out to ride, professor turned to me and he said, "Mr. Mathews, why is it that my horse is the only one with horns?" [ALL LAUGH] The way you talk about it, Mr. Mathews, I wouldn't mind going along on one of those trail drives. Now you say there were 265,000 head driven up from Texas last year. That's right, sir. And there'll be three times that many next year. And three times more the year after if we get this National Trail Bill passed. This is all very interesting, Mr. Mathews, but, uh, where does such a large operation leave the small farmer, the homesteader? I'm glad you asked that question, Mr. President. CLAY: What the homesteaders want is cheap cattle they can afford to buy. And Texas is full of cheap cattle. Folks just got to be guaranteed a way to get them there. Mr. President, it's the little fellow I'm most concerned about. That is a private party, Mr. Brassfield. Even though you are a member of the Club, you must have an invitation. MATHEWS: Don't take my word for it. Ask one of these small ranchers. Mr. Travers, there. He represents all the Jackson Hole outfits. I just got an invitation. The ranchers all want the trail, sir. Everyone. I'm afraid that's not entirely accurate, Mr. President. Nobody invited you in here, Brassfield. From what I've just been hearing, somebody should have. PRESIDENT: Uh, Mr. Mathews, I, uh-- I would like to hear what this gentlemen has to say. I take it you disagree with what's being said here, sir. Rather with what's not being said, Mr. President. I heard no mention of wild speculation, overstocked range conditions, Texas ticks and Texas fever, and scrub stock that's already depressed the market. That's a lie. Gentlemen, if you please. I'm sorry, sir, but as a Wyoming cattleman, this becomes a matter of life and death to me. And if I'm forced to, I'll fight it on that basis. You mean, literally, sir? With every gun and every man on the Teton. Those are pretty strong words. I'm sorry I had to use them. I apologize for the intrusion. [CHATTER] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Hello, Harry. Uh, George downstairs said you, uh, wanted to see me. That's right. Come on in. Come on in. [CLEARS THROAT] I was, uh, just going out to look for Johnny Quatro. I thought maybe you'd like to ride home with us. Oh, well, I-- I-I can't, Sam. I got some, uh, press-- Well, I just can't. Not today. Business with Clay Mathews? Now, look, Sam, I've got a ranch, same as you. One 50th the size, maybe, but it is a ranch and I run it. I got a right to make up my own mind to things. That's all I'm asking you to do, make up your mind. You see, I've made mine up. Sharleen and I are going to be married. I wouldn't wanna wind up fighting with my own brother-in-law. [GUITAR MUSIC] MAN: Myrt, that's the finest apple pie I ever had. Whiskey. JOHNNY: Hey, senor. I know you. I seen you one time before in Jackson. You remember? Say hello to the man, little cousin. I would rather say hello to you. Oh. Who's your Mexican friend? Sam Brassfield's right-hand man. Oh. Is that so? Things might as well get started right away, hadn't they? You better leave it alone until after we see the boss. You're gonna make me leave it alone? Hey, you, girl. Come here and have a drink with me. [CHUCKLES] She's pretty busy, senor. [BOTH CHUCKLE] I said, come here. And I mean right now. You stay right here. MAN: Maybe you didn't hear me, sweetheart. I said come here. [WOMAN GRUNTS] Oh, senor. Keep your hands off her. And suppose I don't, chili-picker, what're you gonna do about it? I kill you. [ALL GRUNTING] [THUDDING] [GRUNTING] You know something, chili-picker? I don't like people saying they're gonna kill me. [GRUNTS] [LAUGHS] [GRUNTS] You wasn't very friendly. We won't disturb him, little cousin. He's played too hard. He needs a nap. Come on, Romeo. Let's get out of here. [CHUCKLES] Listen, you--Remember what I told you? If you get in trouble, it's good to have a friend around. [WHOOPING] Well, you've been wanting to meet Sam Brassfield. You just met him. I'll remember him. Sam, Johnny. I'm glad you're back. June. Ruthie. Come on out. They're back. Sam. Hey, Ed. Johnny. Oh, boy, did you have a good time. Yeah. Our friend here was playing again. You should have seen the fight, Ed. It was just like old times. Did you find out anything? I'm not sure. I told the Association to stay out of it. We'll talk about it later. Yeah, I'll take care of the horses. Johnny. Welcome home, uncle. Hello, Ruth. Welcome home, Sam. Do the girls in Cheyenne still miss me? Oh, yes. I saw dozens of them, prostrate with grief. I cheered them up for you. Ah.Thanks. Thanks. Hope you got something to eat. I'm starved. Ain't you always? Come on. I got a big hunk of venison. Johnny, let's play some poker. No, I'm sorry, Webb. I spent all my money. You know, in Cheyenne, I have so many-- [IN UNISON] Cousins I have to take care of. [ALL LAUGH] Alright. Come on, you two now. Get out of here. June and I want to do up the dishes. I don't know about you, Sam, but I don't wanna get a broom broke over my head. [CHUCKLES] Ruth, you're married to the sweetest man in the world and you know it. You shouldn't pick on him so. You don't need to tell me how sweet my husband is. There was pictures of 50 other women in that lonely hearts catalog, and he chose me out of the whole bunch. That's good enough for me. I never know whether to believe that story or not. You might as well believe it, because it's the truth. And if you don't find yourself a man pretty soon, I'm gonna slip your picture in one of them same catalogs. Come on, let's get these dishes done. [DOOR CLOSES] How'd everything go while I was away? Well, fair enough, I guess, except Webb had another run in with Abe Clevenger. The kid's got to learn to control his temper. Yeah, but he's got the makings of a good hand. Still a little too much paw and beller in him, but that ain't gonna hurt him any. Clevenger's one man I don't want trouble with. He packs a lot of weight with small ranchers. He does that, alright, but he's the orneriest cuss I ever met in my life. We need him, Ed. Sheepherder. That's what he is. A dern sheepherder. I never did like sheep and I never will. Sam, you feel like you wanna tell me about what happened in Cheyenne? Mathews is going all out. He's offering to lease every place in the valley. He even offered to cut me in. He did? There must be an awful lot of money in back of him. Well, if a man wants to lie and twist figures a little, he can make the cattle business sound mighty inviting to someone who wants to invest. How far do you figure he'll go? All the way. And he's taking Harry Travers right along with him. Now you listen to me, Travers. And you listen good. I've gone too far now to back down. I want that range open. And I want it wide open. You hear? I told you what to tell your neighbors. Now, you tell it to 'em. Uh, sure, Clay. I'm with you. It's just that, uh--Just what, Travers? Well, uh, n-nothing. Forget it. There's gonna be some fence-cutting. Maybe somebody's gonna get hurt, but all you've got to remember is you saw Sam Brassfield cutting his own fence. You hear? Yeah, yeah, Clay. I understand. Now, don't make any mistakes. I always sort of liked you, Harry. [CHUCKLES] I don't trust a man who takes that much time making up his mind. Get the rest of your boys, Bodine. We're riding out. Let's see if we can't stir up a little trouble for Mr. Brassfield. Now there's an idea that appeals to me. Personally. [DRAMATIC MUSIC ] [DRAMATIC MUSIC ] If I didn't know better, I'd swear you was going girling. Uh, no. I-- I just thought I'd take a ride. Oh, will you, uh, tell Sharleen I've got that light bread biscuit recipe she wanted. Sam, how nice to see you. Didn't Webb tell you I was coming by? You don't have to make it seem so obvious. I don't care if my nephew does know I like girls. You glad to see an old bachelor who has two kids? How do you think that would sound to someone who didn't know Webb and June were your niece and nephew? Well, it'd make me sound like quite a devil, I'd say. Feel like taking a walk? I'd love to. Where? Uh, down by the river. I wanna look for a couple of strays. As I say, always so romantic. Come on. [ROMANTIC MUSIC] Care to join me? Oh, I'm so glad we came here. Where are the strays? Uh, they can take care of themselves. Do you know something? What? I love you. I brought you this from Cheyenne. Oh, Mr. Brassfield. Imagine. All the way from Cheyenne. Sam. Don't you like it? Of course I like it. Oh, Sam. I wish it could stay like this forever. Can't it? The world's still out there. World's always out there. Always has been. More important, it always will be. Tell me about the world that's going to be. I wish I could, Sharleen. I guess I didn't think much about it before June and Webb came to live with me. You never told me much about their parents. Their mother was my kid sister. Nobody could have been spoiled more than we spoiled her. We were all guilty. Anything she wanted, she had. So while I was gone during the war, she wanted a man named Fremont Carter-- If you'd rather not talk about it... You know what I just decided love is? Having someone to talk to. Someone you don't have to choose your words with. I haven't talked about it in a long time. Well, don't now. Yeah, Fremont Carter. He left her, my sister died. I have two kids. How are you going to like having two kids almost your own age, Mrs. Brassfield? I'm just going to love it, Mr. Brassfield. It's beautiful, Sam. So are you. HARRY: Now ain't that a pretty picture? [CHUCKLES] Uh, well, go ahead on, there. D-Don't mind me. You're both great big grown-up people. SHARLEEN: Harry. I didn't even know you were home. Well, that doesn't surprise me. Since when has anybody ever known that old Harry was home? SHARLEEN: Oh, Harry, stop it. Don't pay any attention to him. He's drunk. Just like all the rest, ain't you, Sam? You say something you think I can't hear it, huh? Well, I can hear, see. And I can see too, hear? Same as you or anybody else. Sure, Harry. I know that. "Sure, Harry. I know." You know everything, don't you? SAM: I didn't say so. Harry, please go in the house and leave us alone. Now, hold on, little sister, I got obligations. Mom said to take care of you, didn't she? That's what she said. I can't go back on in the house and leave you out here with some stranger on the porch. Harry, please go in the house and leave us alone. No, no. I'm just gonna sit down right here. Well, you go ahead on. Both of you. Don't mind me. [CHUCKLES] Forget it. He'll finish his bottle and then sober up. SHARLEEN: You know better. He'll be at it for a month. SAM: Well, then, let him. You do all the work around here, anyway. We're not talking about me, we're talking about my brother. What do you want me to do? Feel sorry for him? You said yourself, you spoiled your sister. Don't you think anyone ever has family problems? Sure. I'm sorry you took it that way. Oh, now that takes a big man. Did you hear that? He feels sorry. [HARRY CHUCKLES] You are a big man, ain't you, Brassfield? Why don't you forget about it? A great big man. Well, you know something, Brassfield? You ain't the only big man in this country. You know why? Because I'm gonna be a big man. That's why. Clay Mathews is gonna have the biggest spread this country has ever seen. And you know who's gonna manage that ranch? Me. That's who. M-E. Me. Good for you, Harry. You're damn right it's good for me. But it's not so good for you, Brassfield. You know what I'm gonna do with you, Brassfield? I'm gonna run you right out of this country. Is that plain enough, huh? Yeah, that's plain, Harry. We'll talk about it tomorrow. Harry, please--Sharleen, keep out of this. He knows exactly what I'm talking about. Cuts his own fences and then goes running off to the Association, hollering for more range detectives to come up here and hang some more homesteaders. That's not very funny, Harry. It sure ain't, is it? Why you suppose he run off to Cheyenne? To see the President? Well, I s-- I saw the President. That's right. Me. Harry Travers. I had supper with the President of the United States. I'll see you tomorrow, Sharleen. He hadn't had a drink in two months. Well, he's had one now. Oh, you went all the way, didn't you, Brassfield? Even ready to marry that girl just to get a hold of my land. [GRUNTS] [DRAMATIC MUSIC ] At least let him sober up by himself. [GRUNTING] I told him what I thought, didn't I? Harry, why did you have to do it? Oh, it ain't no harm done, sis. Don't you worry none. That's right. No harm done. The harm was done a long time ago. Oh, now, sis. Well, I'm- I'm sorry, but, well, you know, I was tired from a long trip and talking business. You know, four days takes it out of a man. [CHUCKLES] What man? Well, me. You're no man. You never have been. You never will be. Sharleen, you don't wanna talk to me like that. Why don't I? I've been wanting to say it for 10 years. I'm sick of your crawling, sniveling, and begging for sympathy. Oh, mother was always there to give it to you, wasn't she? Her only son, her first-born. Sis, you're getting yourself all worked up. You're damned right I'm getting worked up. I'm sick of living my life for you. I'm sick of apologizing for you. I have a life of my own to live. I'm going to be married, and nothing on this earth is going to come between me and Sam. And least of all you. I'm through with you. Do you understand? I'm through with you. Now, get out. Get out! [DRAMATIC MUSIC ] [SOBBING] [HENS CLUCKING] Come on, Johnny, there's a lot of work to do on a ranch. Now hurry up. Hey, doggone you, Johnny Quarto. That does it. You come on off that wagon and I'll beat your hide off. Oh, I wouldn't like that. Uh, so I think I might as well stay up here, huh? Oh, well then I am coming up there. Whoa. [LAUGHS] [WHISTLING] Hey, boss, there's work to be done around here. [JOHNNY WHISTLING] [LAUGHING] [SIGHS] Johnny, I'm gonna kill you. You wouldn't do it in front of company, would you? WEBB: Hey, Harry. When-- When did you get back from Cheyenne? Few days ago. Is Sam around? W-What's wrong? Something-- Something the matter? No, I just want to talk to Sam. Did Sam say where he was going, Johnny? Think he's in the house working on the books or something. If he's not there, June will know where he is. Anything we can do to help you, Harry? No. That's alright. I'll-- I'll talk to Sam. Come on. Yeah. [HOOFBEATS DEPARTING] [GRUNTS] Now what-- What's eating on him? Same thing that's eating on everyone else, I guess. Too much night riding, fence-cutting. Yeah. If I was running things around here, I'd hang a gun on every member of the Teton crew. I'd tell 'em to shoot first and ask questions later. That's what I'd do. I think we better let Sam run the ranch for a while. Yeah. But, Johnny, what I mean is-- Hey, you'd better go in and dry off. You're wet. A little behind the ears, maybe. JUNE: I've been meaning to get over to visit with Sharleen, but since all this happened with Hobie... HARRY: Oh, I know how it is. Company, uncle. Hello, Harry. [CLEARS THROAT] June, why d-- Why don't you get us some coffee, huh? Of course. I, uh... I-- Ahem-- I've come over to apologize. I'm sorry. Is that what Sharleen told you to say? That's sort of kicking a man when he's down, isn't it, Sam? Sit down. Why don't we stop fooling ourselves, Harry? We don't like each other. We never have. You've decided to go one way, I'm going another. Well, that's the whole point, Sam. I-- I haven't decided anything. You seemed fairly sure of yourself the last time I talked to you. I've never been sure of anything in my whole lifelong. You know that. I guess that is hard for you to understand, isn't it, Sam? You know where you're going. Every move you're gonna make. Well, I don't. I wake up every morning scared. And if I don't start something, at least I-- I know I won't fail finishing it. Well, look, Harry, if you need some help or anything, if you wanna borrow a few of my hands-- No. Well, I guess it's, uh... Not as simple as that. B-But thanks, anyway. Well, ahem, like I say, uh, I am sorry. [SIGHS] If they found out I told you this, they're gonna kill me. But I'm gonna tell you anyway. Clay Mathews is moving in on you. He's hired a Texas killer by the name of Vince Bodine. That's the one that's been cutting your fences. And that's the one that killed Hobie too. Mathews wanted me to talk Clevenger and the others into believing that you're trying to make a land grabbing. I told him I would. You know why I told him I would? Because I was scared not to. You've changed your mind? [SIGHS] I don't know. All I want is that Sharleen shouldn't be tied down any longer. You can't stand in the middle, Harry. I've been doing that all my life, haven't I? Harry. Thanks for coming over. Oh. Aren't you going to stay for coffee? Oh, I-- No, June. Not this time. [DRAMATIC MUSIC ] Well, what are we waiting for? You know who's behind it. He wants war, let's give it to him. Calm down, Webb. I'm still running things around here. It looks to me you're running them right in the ground. Easy, amigo.You watch your sass, boy. Sam, what do you think our next move ought to be? I've gotta talk to Abe Clevenger. Try to make him see this. He has more influence with the nesters than any of the others. You mean you're gonna crawl to him? Now, what good is talking to Abe Clevenger gonna do? I tried to talk to him and he ran me off his place with a shotgun. Well, if you accused him of fence-cutting and murder I can't say that I blame him. Webb, sometimes I think you talk too much. You've only got Harry's word for that. As far as you know, maybe, Clevenger told Harry to tell you all of this. I say, let's show those nesters we mean business. Webb, you ride along with us and take orders from me or you stay right here. Now make up your mind. [DOOR OPENS THEN CLOSES] That's all I need is a hotheaded kid. Above all, I don't want trouble. Not right now. The President and his party left Green River several days ago. They're up in this part of the country somewhere right now. Let one man get killed and every newspaper in the world will know about it. That's right. You think you can talk to Abe Clevenger? I don't know, Ed. All I know is, he's an honest man. If he can put common sense and decency ahead of his hatred for the Cattlemen's Association, maybe I can talk with him. We'll try, anyway. I guess today is as good as any other. I'll get the horses. [DOOR CLOSES] I know how you feel, kid. Me, I guess I feel the same way. I can't see crawling and begging for favors. It's pretty hard for me to wait to find the man who killed my friend. But I'm waiting. How long? That's what I wanna know. I don't run this ranch. I don't think I could. Lots of times I would fight instead of wait. I talked to Ed about that once. You know what he said? He said, "Johnny, the difference between Sam and you and me "is that Sam knows that any fool can fight. "A smart man, he fights, only when he knows there's no other way." Well, there's no other way now. I think they've got him scared. [SIGHS] Don't ever let me hear you say that again. I know Sam too long to let anybody say that. You ever see a man killed with a gun? If you ever do, you're not going to like it. [DRAMATIC MUSIC ] [DOOR CLOSES] He's going to see old Clevenger, alright. I figured he would. He's playing right into our hands. I still don't like the way Harry Travers is acting. Why? Regardless of what he said, he got Brassfield out in the open, didn't he? [SHEEP BLEATING] SAM: Clevenger. Sam Brassfield. Anybody home? Right here, Brassfield. What's the matter, Brassfield? Afraid to come here alone? SAM: What's the matter with you? Afraid to talk to me without a shotgun in your hand? What do you want? I ain't got no time for visiting. Harry Travers gave me some information I thought might be of interest to you. If Harry has something to say to me he can say it direct. Now, get out. We came here peacefully, Abe. I don't want trouble with you or any of the rest of my neighbors. That ain't the way that kid there of yours tells it. Accused me of fence-cutting and shooting one of your hands. Well, you've accused us of trying to fence you in and drive your sheep off. I don't like the way you're grabbing land. If you say I ever fenced one acre that I didn't own you're a liar. You speak your mind plain, Brassfield. I feel it's the only kind of talk you'll listen to. ABE: What was it Harry had to say? Clay Mathews has hired a bunch of Texas gunslingers to try and stir up trouble with the Teton. They're doing the fence-cutting, not you or any of your friends. Do you think your high and mighty Stock Growers Association is gonna believe that? The Association has nothing to do with it. I'm talking about you and me. I'm giving it to you plain, Abe. You make up your mind how it's going to be. Sam, what do you think? That's hard to tell with a man like Clevenger. He's like a lot of people in this country, he hates success.It seems like a man who fights for something little, he's a hero. He fights for something big, and they call him a range hog or a cattle king. CLAY: Alright, Bodine. You and your boys know what to do. VINCE: Don't worry. You'll get what you paid for. [DRAMATIC MUSIC ] ALL: Hyah. VINCE: You stand put, old man. Brassfield says you're having trouble making up your mind. So we're gonna make it up for you. Alright, boys, start tearing this place apart board by board. And when you finish here, then start working on them sheep. Brassfield doesn't want one of them stinking woollies left alive when we leave here. Well, there's a start. MAN 1: Hyah. MAN 2: Woo-hoo. [GUNFIRE] [SHEEP BLEATING] Hello, Abe. Brassfield, I'm gonna watch you die. [DRAMATIC MUSIC ] [GRUNTS] SAM: Put that gun away, Webb. The man's hurt. Can't you see that? What's the matter with you? He tried to kill you. SAM: Well, he didn't, did he? Now, get him in the house. You get up. [GRUNTING] I didn't want this to happen, Abe. You should've killed me when you had the chance, Brassfield. I'll come after you again, and I'll have every outfit in the valley with me. Those weren't my men tore your place up. You're a liar. Get away from me. You're a Brassfield too. I ain't gonna stop now until I drive you all out of the valley. Every one of you. [GRUNTING] JUNE: Uncle. Has Webb left to get the doctor? Yes. But I don't think a doctor can cure what's wrong with that man. I've never seen such hatred in my life. Can you blame him? Ten years of back-breaking work torn down right before his eyes. His sheep stampeded. But don't you understand? He is going to try to kill you. Well, honey, you can depend on me to do what I can to see that that doesn't happen. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Will you see who that is, Ruth? MAN: Is Mr. Brassfield in, please? Won't you come in? Mr. Brassfield. Yes. Didn't I see you at the Cheyenne Club? Yes, sir. Stafford. Secretary to President Chester A. Arthur. Mr. Brassfield, the Presidential party is camped a few miles south of here. The President has expressed an interest in visiting your ranch. The President wants to come here to see me? The President of the United States? [CHUCKLES] I, uh-- I hope we didn't choose an inopportune time, but we'll be in this area for only one more night. Of course not, Mr. President. I'm delighted and honored to have you. Uh, this is my niece June Carter. President Chester A. Arthur. How do you do? And, uh, my manager's wife, Ruth Winters. How do you do? Land of Goshen. Look at this house. It's a mess. [ALL CHUCKLE] I, uh-- I believe I recall my own late wife making that same speech on more than one occasion. Mr. Brassfield, uh, I was anxious to see a cattle ranch firsthand. I was told this was one of the best in the territory. Well, we like to think so. I'd be happy to show it to you. Stafford, if you'll, uh, tell General Sheridan and the others we plan to stop over here for a few hours. Yes, sir. Would you care to go outside? By all means. SAM: After you, sir.PRESIDENT: Thank you. I started up breeding my stock a little over five years ago. That, uh, pasture of hay I showed you back there makes good winter feed. Well-kept ranch, Mr. Brassfield. I wanted you to see this, Mr. President. Well, you know, there's, uh, been much criticism of the big cattlemen moving in and taking what they want of the public land. It's feared that they'll destroy it and then move on. Move on where, Mr. President? Days of free grass are gone. It's been a big change in this country, and I felt I had to change with it. I realized there are a lot of people who don't agree with me. Strangely, Mr. Brassfield, you and I occupy somewhat, uh, similar positions. I too have discovered that when a man tries to stand up to his responsibility, there's a good chance that he'll make many enemies. And sadly, he may even lose some of his old friends. We'd best be getting back, or the Army will be out looking for me. [SIGHS] A little privacy is a precious thing. Straighten that sofa. That Sam Brassfield. Inviting the President here without giving me any warning. I tell you, Ed Winters, it was a sad day when you got mixed up with that man. Ruthie, Sam is my best friend. You know that. Well, then you go out there and polish the silver and cook the dinner. Just like a man. "Come on in to dinner," he says. Just like him. What does he think I can do? Turn myself into a roast beef or a dried apple pie any time he snaps his fingers? I'm afraid I'm putting you to a great deal of trouble, Mrs. Winters. [MUTTERS] I'm-- I'm used to it around this place. I, uh-- I'd like it very much if all you folks would come out to our camp. We have six cooks traveling with the party. No. you're staying right here now. I got everything fixed. Six cooks? Yes. They're all men, I suppose. It's hard telling what they've been feeding you. Frankly, Mrs. Winters, uh, I would prefer your cooking. Well, just happens I-I have enough. So don't let it worry you none. Can I take your hat?Thank you. And next time, wipe your feet before you come into this house. June and I just finished cleaning. Ruthie, that was the President of the United States. Well, his boots get just as dirty as anybody else's if he walks in the mud. I must say, Mrs. Winters, I believe that is the finest meal I have ever eaten. Just plain old ranch cooking, that's all. [ALL CHUCKLE] Uh... Y-You can call me Ruth if you want to. Why, thank you, uh, Ruth. I'll do that. You're a very fortunate man, Mr. Winters. I think so. Mr. Brassfield, I, uh, I hope you won't think I'm rude, but I would like to talk with you for a moment, if I may. Yes, sir, of course. Sit down. Sit down. Please, all of you. I hope we're not standing on protocol here. That's a pretty fine man, our Presidente.You know that? I have enjoyed myself immensely, Mr. Brassfield. Well, it's certainly been an honor having you, sir. [SIGHS] PRESIDENT: I, uh-- I'm reluctant to bring up an unpleasant subject. SAM: If there's any information I can give you. You seemed quiet adamant about this National Cattle Trail Bill the other night. Only because it's years behind its time. It can only result in overstocking our ranges with inferior cattle. You feel that fencing and controlled breeding are the only solution? I believe that very strongly, sir. PRESIDENT: I've heard complaints that the Cattleman's Association has been arbitrary, high-handed in its dealings. Well, sir, when there's very little formal law for a man to call on, he immediately tries to form a regulating body. A regulating body, Mr. Brassfield? Or a punitive committee? I've been told that there's been outright warfare here. And killings. SAM: Yes, sir, there have. I lost one of my best hands just recently. And it's been reported that a man's house was torn down. His sheep were driven off. Are you involved in this, Mr. Brassfield? Not involved, no, sir. But I know the man you refer to. His name is Abe Clevenger. He's here in this house. Wounded, seriously. I'm the man who wounded him. You shot a man? Not because he opposes any of my views. I-- I shot him because if I hadn't, he'd have killed me. In heaven's name, why did he try to kill you? Abe Clevenger's an honest man, Mr. President. He honestly believes that I was out to destroy him. Because he believes it honestly, I respect him. But isn't this a matter for the law or perhaps your, uh, Cattlemen's Association? SAM: Why? Because a man is willing to stand up for what he believes is right? And you'd protect a man who tried to kill you? Give me a choice between these spoilers, these National Cattle Trail proponents, these paper profiteers, and a man like Abe Clevenger, who-- Who owns his land and wants to preserve it. I'll fight on the side of Abe Clevenger. It's been recommended, Mr. Brassfield, that I send Federal troops into this territory if the situation worsens. Well, I'll do everything in my power to see that it doesn't. I see. I appreciate having your views. Thank you, sir. I just took breakfast into Mr. Clevenger, and he actually thanked me for it. He must be sicker than I thought. When'll Webb get back with the doctor? Well, it's a long ride. He'll get here as soon as he can. Meanwhile, you're not doing anybody any good pacing up and down like that. What do you expect me to do with myself? Well, you might go over and see Sharleen and tell her about your visit with the President. If I were your girl, I'd like to hear about it. I hadn't thought about it. Hadn't you? You're getting worse than Ruth. [HOOFBEATS APPROACHING] Uh. Hello, Mr. Bodine. You ought to stay home more, Travers. Uh, I don't guess I know what you mean. Oh, I figure you do. You been seeing Sam Brassfield. Oh, well, I went over to his place, but that was on ranch business. Was it? Well, that's all it was. Why-- I swear. I think you're a liar, Travers. And I think you talk way too much. Who is it?Sharleen, get back in the house. [GUNSHOT] [WHINNYING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC ] HARRY: Sam! Sam! Over here, the corral. [DRAMATIC MUSIC ] Harry. What happened? Bodine. He found out I talked to you. I was coming to tell you. Where's Sharleen? Is she alright? She's dead, Sam. Sharleen is dead. You were right, Sam. A man can't live in the past. He can't stand still in the middle either. I wanna stay here, make a go of it. That's what she would have wanted most. I may need a little help. At first. We'll all be here, Harry. This is between Mathews and me. I'm gonna try and keep it that way. None of you had anything to do with it. I'm not asking you to get mixed up in it. What's the matter? You think I wouldn't stand by him? No, I didn't think that. Not for a minute. They work for you, Sam. Your trouble is their trouble. Alright, you ranchers. You saw what happened to Abe Clevenger's place, didn't you? Well, that's what's gonna happen to all of you if we don't take care of Sam Brassfield right now. Come on. Let's ride. [DRAMATIC MUSIC ] CLAY: Get those cutters and cut that wire. [HOOFBEATS APPROACHING] That's as far as you'd go. What're you waiting for? There's only four of them. Remember what he did to Abe Clevenger? This started out as a personal fight, Clay. That's changed now because you changed it all. You raided Abe Clevenger's place. You're a liar, Clay. You wanted to make trouble between me and my neighbors. Swenson, McCoy, Hartford, Deneen, Farwell, have we ever had any trouble? You wanna wind up like Clevenger? Let's ride 'em down. [DRAMATIC MUSIC ] [MEN MUTTERING] You start it, and a lot of good men are gonna be killed. I'm asking you, Clay, keep this personal. I've been waiting to see you, Brassfield. Do you remember me from Cheyenne? Take him, Mathews. If you don't get him, I will. Alright, Brassfield. ED: Hold it, Mathews. You men better all look at who's coming. You fight Sam Brassfield, you're gonna fight me. [MEN MUTTERING] Don't make me do it, Clay. [DRAMATIC MUSIC ] That was for Hobie. Why couldn't you realize you can't turn back the clock? Alright, the rest of you. Is it worth it? ABE: I appreciate how you took care of me. JUNE: You were a very good patient, Mr. Clevenger. I was no such, and don't you accuse me of it. As for you, Sam Brassfield, you had no right taking your boys over there, patching my place up. Like as not, I have to do it all over. Why, you ungrateful old whelp. Mind your manners, boy. You'll live to grow tall, and when you do, thanks to fellows like me and your uncle, there'll be some grass left for you to graze on. Giddyup. Giddyup. Alright, we got a ranch to run.
