[faith, narrating] christmas is a magical time of year, especially where I grew up. For as long as people in ponchatoula can remember, things happened at christmas that no one could seem to explain. When my grandparents were kids, billy finch wished for a pony. And it was in his backyard the next morning. Both of his parents swore they did not buy it. When my parents were teenagers, their teacher, mrs. Johnson, wished for an answer to her financial woes. And wouldn't you know it? She found a winning lottery ticket on the sidewalk that same week. [camera shutters click] after a while, the town believed there was real magic in the air. My family was certainly no exception. I guess it's fitting, then, that my parents named me faith. Come on, maddie. My sister maddie and I could not wait to put our wishes in the wishing box, which was set out every year on the first day of December. We would write down our heart's deepest desires, fold them extra, extra tight, and then we'd grab hands and close our eyes before dropping them in. A lucky few would have their wishes granted by the wish committee, a tradition that started when we were kids. But maybe, just maybe, your wish would be granted by something, or someone, even bigger. Back then, I believed I had hope in the impossible. And things never seemed more possible than at christmas. But that was a very long time ago. -[girl] morning, miss mason. -Hey, stella. Good morning. You making a wish? Yeah. See you at school. [faith] I'll see you there. Oh. [bells jingle] -hello? -[porter] hey. I was just wondering if I had gotten out of bed for nothing. Sorry I'm late, mr. Porter. Thank you so much for opening up early for me again. Well, I wouldn't do it for anybody, you know. I mean, I am your favorite customer. So, what are you cooking up this week? Well, today is the last day before winter break, so all the kids are putting the finishing touches on their homemade gifts. -Really? -I know what you're thinking. These are not macaroni necklaces or awful popsicle stick picture frames. These, my friend, are works of art. I have had this one little boy all semester knitting a hat for his sister, and it is adorable. [chuckles] we've been running dangerously low on supplies, so I just wanted to stock up and make sure the kids have everything they need to take their gifts home. You really go above and beyond for those kids, don't you? Well, yeah. They're good kids. I know. Okay. These. That's it. That's all I'm going to do for today. Yeah. Right. Anything special for the holiday? I'm going to sleep in. I might read a book. My sister maddie's coming into town. She's bringing her new boyfriend. We think he's the one. -Oh, good for her. -Mm-hm. Hey, you and maddie plan on putting anything in the wishing box this year? I think I'm a little old for the wishing box. Well, if you're too old, I'm way too old. But I've already put in my wish. What did you wish for? Well, I can't tell you, or it won't come true. -[both laugh] -I think it's very sweet that you are an honest-to-goodness believer. But my mother's on the wish committee, so I know how the whole thing works. Although I will keep my fingers crossed -your wish gets pulled. -Well, there was a time when there was no wish committee, you know? That wishing box is nearly as old as the town itself. Well, I have heard all the stories. And they are magical. I, however, am late to school, so thank you so much for your help today. -You betcha. -Put it on my tab. You are the best. -Enjoy the candy -thank you. Ho, ho, ho. [both laugh] thank you. Talia, why are we refilling the cream? It's 7:00 a.M. Everyone cheats during the holidays. Extra sugar, extra spice, and mountains of whipped cream. He's here again. Same table. Oh, really? I hadn't noticed. You said you were going to go talk to him last week and the week before that. He looks busy. [talia] his name's andrew. He lives right up the street. Just go say hey. What's the worst that could happen? I could find out that we have nothing in common. Or that, like, he's a bad tipper. -He's a great tipper. -Oh, god. Okay, fine. Then he's perfect. Why ruin it? -Got to go. -Bye. Bye. -[door opens] -[bells jingle] I know, I know. We're going to be late for work. -What'd you get me? -Huh? I get breakfast on wednesdays. This is Tuesday. Tomorrow's holiday break, so I'm calling it off. -Oh, blueberry. -Wyatt. All right, I'll get my own. It was the last one. You can have half. Okay, then I accept. -[gasps] -oh! Hey, are you okay? Oh, yes. I'm all right, thank you. -[faith] okay. Come on. -[woman] oh. -You good? - Oh, just my boot. Oh, no, here. I got you. [groaning] let me see here. All right, well, I'll tell you, I really like your laces. Those are very festive. Oh, well, it's the little things that make a person stand out. I think so too. Now, unfortunately, I do not think you're going to be able to walk on those anymore. -No. -But I think I have a solution. Hold on, let me see your foot. Yup. Okay. I was going to wear these later, but you need them more. I couldn't possibly take your shoes. -No. No, no, no, no. -Yeah. Please. They are a work of art. I make stuff like this all the time. Really. And I have to walk to school, so I'll just wear my sneakers. I'm good. Please. [woman] oh, my. Oh! Oh, they fit so good. Oh, good. Beauty. See? It was meant to be. Oh! [laughs] -how can I repay you? -No, no, no. -It's a gift. -I think that's everything. You sure you don't need help with this? No, I'm fine. You and your lovely girlfriend, -you have done so much. -Oh... -No, she's not my girlfriend. -We're friends. Oh, well, my mistake. Well, merry christmas. -Yeah. Merry christmas. See you. -Bye. [kids chatter indistinctly] -[school bell rings] -[wyatt] good morning, greta. Getting back from dance class? Tuesdays, thursdays, and fridays. Have a great holiday. You too. We're in the homestretch. All right, see you. Oh, my god. I hope I am that cool in my 70s and I start a new hobby. Oh, my god. I'm into it if you're into it. Maybe we'll get our black belt in karate. -Yes. -Learn how to scuba dive. I'm glad that we're still friends in our golden years. Yeah. We're gonna keep getting better with age, I think. Really good job, you guys. I am very impressed. Yes, I like-- I like what's happening here. Michael, tell me who this handsome guy is. This is harvey, my grandpa's dog. [faith] oh, grandpa's dog. He's very smart-looking. Do you hang out with him all the time? You guys are doing so great. Oh, man. Aiden, this crosshatching is incredible. What are you going to name this tree? Hmm. The family tree. The family tree. Oh, my gosh. Miss stella. Why the long face? -It's ruined. -What are you talking about? Anybody would love to display their flowers in this. [stella] it's cracked. See? -Right there. -Oh, honey. I see. Well, where you see a crack, I see a golden opportunity. May I? Check this out. Going to let you in on a little secret. Life seldom goes as planned. So we just have to change our perspective. To quote my own personal hero, the one and only bob ross, we do not make mistakes, my friend. Only happy accidents. What do you think? How's the strand of light to fix things? -It's perfect. -You like that? -Yeah. -All right. Keep going, and I'll tell you what. We'll put a little sealant on the inside so it doesn't leak. -Yeah. Thank you. -Okay. Okay, ladies and gentlemen. You have exactly 30 minutes to finish. Ready, set, go. Make every minute count. [inaudible] [inaudible] [school bell rings] all you guys, have a great holiday. Enjoy your break. Make sure you pick up your projects after school. I will miss you, but I will see you in the new year. Oh, bye, honey. I'll see you later. Have a great break. Bye, hon. I'll see you later. Thank you. -Miss mason? -Yeah? Can I see you in my office? Sure. I'll be right there. Hi. Sorry. If this is about the new pottery wheel I requested, I feel terrible, but someone thought it would be funny to put a big old can of paint on top, and... There's not going to be a new pottery wheel. There's actually going to be no more pottery, period. Okay. I'm having a little bit of trouble following you. [sighs] there's no easy way to say this, especially at this time of year, but the school board has voted to cut the funding for the arts program. By how much? All of it. -What? -I'm sorry. My hands are tied. But that money is earmarked for technology upgrades that are state-mandated. So the art room... Becomes the new computer lab. We're going to keep you for the remainder of the year, of course. But you are going to have to start clearing out your room. I'm happy to write you a recommendation letter. It's not about me. This is about the kids. I mean, you know how they are at this age. They don't know how to express themselves. My classroom is where they figure that out. I'm really sorry, faith. Just so you know, I tried my best, and I'm always on your side. Thank you for letting me know. Yes! Just passed out my final "why you should get your flu shot" pamphlet, and it feels good. Thanks again for the pin. Got a lot of compliments on this baby. What's up? You okay? No. You're standing in the new computer lab, as of this spring. Faith. You're serious? I just ran into bob from the music department. They're getting rid of the jazz ensemble too. What? What is wrong with people? I mean, when did art and music become, like, disposable? [scoffs] yeah, and I'm the last school nurse in the whole parish. I guess health and wellness are up for debate too. I'm so sorry, faith. I know how much you love what you do. Yeah. It'll all be fine. I just... I really worry about these kids. They need a place where they don't have to be perfect. That's the beauty of this room, you know? All their little mistakes are awesome. [sighs] like, look at this guy. This is the perfect example. Can you imagine a world where he doesn't exist? [laughs] I don't think I want to live in that world. Me neither. It's going to be okay. You're going to figure out something. You always do. And I'm always here for help. Thanks. You're the best. Yeah. [inhales and exhales sharply] all right, are you ready for carpool? Oh, I love carpool. Let's do it. See you later. Hey, so what's up? Are you going to your brother's house for the holidays? They're going on an alaskan cruise this year. Gift from the in-laws. That's a nice gift. What are you doing? Well, my parents are visiting my sister in chicago, so I'm just chilling. Going to play some video games, watch some nature documentaries. You can't spend the holidays all by yourself. Just come to my family's house. My parents would love to see you. Yeah, I don't want to impose. I know maddie's coming over. We could do something tomorrow, though. Just thinking about getting a christmas tree, maybe. You're going to get a tree? Even though I'm jewish, my mom gets a tree every year. Plus, it smells good. Might remind me of home. You realize there's only a week left before christmas. Bye, honey. You're cutting it really close. Not everyone starts decorating the day after thanksgiving, like somebody. I stand by my decision, thank you. -Hey, come on. Come on. -[blows whistle] all right. Crossing. Have a great break. Have a good holiday, guys. Bye. So are you in for tomorrow? Yeah, I'm in. [blows whistle] I'm here, and I come bearing wine. Sissy! Hi! Maddie! Hi. -Oh, I missed you. -I missed you too. Let me look at you. You get prettier every time I see you. -No, stop. -With that fresh colorado air. -[laughs] -how's it going in there? So far, so good. Dad picked us up from the airport in his patrol car, which I think gave ryan just the right amount of anxiety. Dad does love to make a statement. [laughs] oh, look who I found snooping around the christmas tree. Are you still a starving artist? Starving? Yeah. -Hi, dad. -Hey. How are you? -Ryan! You're here! -Hey! Welcome to the madness. Good to see you, bud. Take these. I could not remember if you were a red or a white guy, so I got you one of each. Have I told you how much I like your sister? How was your last day, sweet girl? Oh, it was-- you know, it was-- busy, chaotic, and the kids were all excited. You're an art teacher, right? That must be really rewarding. It is, yeah. Hey, mom, gingerbread cookies. Do we have the stuff for them? Dough, sprinkles, icing, candy. Yeah, it's all in there. I haven't decorated cookies since I was, like, 10. -Sounds fun. -Oh, it's not going to be fun. -[laughs] -it's going to be war. [faith] it's on, buddy. Okay. These are no ordinary gingerbread cookies. These are going to be some of the most famous faces in history and pop culture, dead or alive. Okay, so faith started this whole celebrity gingerbread competition in, like, the eighth grade. And it just kind of stuck. Dad usually likes musicians, politicians are your thing. Usually. Mom is partial to, like, powerful women in history. Gingerbabe, if you will. Thanks. And maddie vacillates between actors and actresses. Really? Yeah. It like my thing. Remember clooney cookie? Faith is a wild card. You never know who to expect. But she always wins, so... -All right, are you ready? -I'm in. Great. Everybody, grab your cookie. On your mark, get set, go. [indistinct chatter] [ryan] thanks. I need the scissors for the green. [indistinct chattering] [laughs] all right, all of you guys have playing cards in front of you, numbered one through ten. When I unveil the cookie, you will slap down your score. One being for indecipherable, ten being a masterpiece. So with no further ado, let us begin with cookie number one. Ooh. Okay, that looks like the grinch. Yeah, good work, daddy. -How'd you know? -Hands. [laughs] you got a score of 30. That's a good start! All right, cookie number two. Ta-da! Ooh! Mick jagger, with those lips and the leather pants. Faith. No, it wasn't me. And it wasn't you either. A rolling stone gathers no moss. Mother, I am impressed with you. What a hip choice. You have a score of 38. Good, good! Onto cookie number three. Oh, this one's maddie's. I know it. She's been in a big elvis phase lately. Listening to all your old vinyl, robert. [maddie] I couldn't decide which elvis, so I went with classic white jumpsuit elvis. -That's always the way to go. -[maddie] thank you. You chose, wisely, because you've earned 42 points. I'm winning? Oh, my god! -[faith] you love this game. -I love this game. Okay, that means there's only two cookies left. It's between you and me, bro. Let's see what happens with cookie number four. Ooh. What is that? Some kind of masked bandit? No, it's... What do you call it? It's a ninja turtle. Michelangelo, to be exact. Cowabunga, ryan. I'm very impressed with your detail work. You put a lot of time and energy into that. And you have earned yourself... You have 45 points. [ryan] whoa! -Oh, you're winning. -[ryan] yeah. Don't get too excited, though, because we have one cookie left, and I think we know who it belongs to. Bam! Ta-da. Okay, so mrs. Claus is yours? That's your meemaw in sweatpants. Are you guys joking? That's clearly bea arthur. -Who's that? -From the golden girls. The best golden girl. It looks like the little old lady, sophia. -[laughs] -[joyce] it's very good. This is a total of, like, 18 points. Wait, does that mean you won? I think so. [maddie] congrats! [robert] congratulations. I'm sorry. Good game, good game. -Congratulations. -[ryan] good game. I'm going to get some milk. -Faith! -Oh, she's upset. It really does look like meemaw. [joyce] it does, doesn't it? Let us do this. We'll take over. -[joyce] are you sure? -Yeah. Yeah, go rest. Why is it that the women always end up in the kitchen? Because we're type a and like things done a certain way. Oh, yeah. I forgot. [laughs] all right, I'm going to head up to bed. -I love you. -I love you too. -Tonight was nice. -My girls. It was fun. All right, stay up as late as you want. -Really? -[joyce] mm-hmm. -For real? -All night? [joyce] night night. Ooh! We can't be trusted. Okay. Spill. What? Tell me what you're not telling me. [laughs] school board decided to cut funding to the arts program. So as of next year, it just doesn't exist. What? Is there anything you can do? I don't know. I, like, found out today and I'm just still processing it. I'm being weird. Have I been edgy? I'm sorry. No, you're fine. You don't always have to be on, especially with me, okay? Have I told you how much I miss you? [laughs] yes. Maybe we should go be bad. Do you want to go be bad? So bad. How bad do you want to be? Like, the baddest. [laughs] should we go get that really dirty ice cream and get a chocolate-dipped cone? With the graham crackers on top? -Oh, my gosh. -We need it. Yes. We've earned it. This can wait. [maddie] mm. This is better than I remembered. I've got to bring ryan here. Thank you for being so nice to him, by the way. -He's awesome. -It means so much to me. He's one heck of a cookie decorator. And he makes you happy. What more could I want? -What about you? -Mm-hmm. Anyone special? -No. -What about coffee shop guy? I regret telling you about that. [laughs] here's my plan for you with him. I feel like what you need to do is you need to just act like your normal self and be like, "oh, I'm so sorry." drop your hot cocoa in his lap, and you have to get some napkins. You have to help him pat it dry. Then looks will be exchanged, then names will be exchanged, and then phone numbers, and who knows what'll happen? A lawsuit. No! This is how it happens in the movies. Movies are dumb and not real. But I don't need a guy to be happy. I don't need ryan. I want ryan. That's a big difference. Dude, the wish box. Let's do it. Just for old time's sake. Come on. Just one. Come on. Thank you. Fine. Fyi... Mom and all her lady friends on the wish committee have already picked their wishes for the year. Well, this isn't for the committee. Who's it for? Santy claus? Hmm. Wait, it's not, right? I believe anything is possible at christmas. I remember a time that you did too. What did you write? Oh, this is just between me and the box, so... Let me see it. If you don't believe that it's true, then why do you care what it says? I didn't say I don't care. -Just... -Okay you can have it. -I'm going to fight you. -Reach for it. It's not even that far. [laughs] what? "I wish for faith mason to have a true love's kiss." is this a fairy tale, or...? Well, either it doesn't come true and nothing changes, or it does and you get a christmas love story. -Guys don't even notice me. -Could you really say no to coffee shop guy swooning over you? Okay. You have to put it in the box so it's gonna come true. That's the wish box rules. -[sighs] -I didn't make them. [cell phone vibrates] that's ryan. -Hey, babe. -Hey, I'll catch up. Go ahead. [wind gusts] [dog barking] [clock radio buzzes] ♪ be my christmas valentine ♪ ♪ and make my dreams come true ♪ ♪ christmas valentine ♪ [music shuts off] [groans and sighs] [whistling] -good morning. -Oh! [laughs] ah! Hey. Hi, I'm john. This is jonah. -We're your new neighbors. -Okay. Please excuse him. Take that in the house. [chuckles] I'm sorry. The moving company misplaced a few of our boxes. It's fine. I'm sorry, I'm faith. I was just coming out to get my paper. Oh, no, let me. Thank you. I normally wear pants. I just wasn't expecting to see you. Or anybody in general. It's okay. I'm happy you did. [laughs] well, welcome. You've moved in at a nice time. Christmas is fun. Oh, yeah, the most magical time of the year. I think so too. So, john, if you ever need a cup of sugar or a cup of...Rice. Or a cup of anything, really, you know where to find me. And you know where to find me. Yes. Just right there. -Right there. -Right there. [sighs] I'm coming, son. Well, it was a pleasure meeting you, faith. I'm sure I'll see you around. I'll see you around... Neighbor. [laughs] neighbor. We're neighbors. Of course I'll see you. Okay, bye. Hmm. [dog barking] -[maddie] hey, babe. -[ryan] hey. Morning. Hey, do you know where the gift card is that I got my dad? I looked in my bag and I can't find it. Yeah, it's in the outside pocket of my carry-on. Oh. Oh, perfect. Okay. [object thuds] [tap water runs] -did you find it? -Yop. Found it. Just perfect, thanks. Great. By the way, your dad invited me to ride along with him on his route this morning. I don't know if I should be scared or excited. I think you should do it. I think... I think it would be good for you guys to spend some quality time together. He talks a big talk, but he's just a big old softy. A softy with a nightstick and a taser on his belt. He's just trying to be cool. I think he always wanted to be a musician, so the fact that I fell in love with one makes him a little bit jealous. -You think I'm cool? -Yes. I think you're the coolest ever. Don't worry, you'll have fun. Yeah. Robert? Look. [laughs] it came. Think you're going to be able to top last year? It's not about the size of the wish. Each one means something to someone, and that's all that matters. [exhales] ooh. "greetings, wish granter. "this year, your recipient is michael mills, age 11. "michael's christmas wish is to see the play a christmas carol "with his grandfather, lewis mills. "thank you from the city of ponchatoula for helping make his wish come true." wait, that's it? Theater tickets? What did you just say about the size of the wish? I mean, I could do this one in my sleep. I've been known to deliver some pretty stellar wishes in my day. -Hey. -Hey. Ooh, did your wish assignment come? Oh, he's so cute. Lucky michael mills. My mom grants the best wishes. One time, we all even took part in this big surprise engagement. -Oh, yeah? -Yeah. They arrived by carriage to the giant christmas tree in the park. We had six trained reindeer at the helm. A gospel choir sang "at last" by etta james. And the whole thing ended with fireworks. Wow. That sounds...Big. It was so romantic. -Ready to hit the road, ryan? -Yes, sir. -Daddy, don't keep him too long. -No promises. Have a good day, boys. I should go too. I have to run some errands. But let me know if you need help with your wish. -Love you. -Love you more. All right, kid. Let's get started. Thank you, guys. Hi. -[bicycle bell dings] -hey! Oh! Are you all right? What? Are you all right? [stammers] oh, yeah...Thank you. Andrew. Yes. I'm faith. Well, I've seen you here before. -You have? -Yeah. Yeah, I'm a regular. Well, sort of. Actually, I was hoping I would run into you. You were? -Yeah. -Oh. Well, it might sound a little strange, but it's like suddenly you've been on my mind. [laughs] what? That's weird. Yeah. Would you want to have dinner? What, together? -Yeah. That's the idea. -Okay, yes. Yes, I would-- that would be fun. Okay. Are you free tonight? I can make tonight work. Great. -Let's say 6:00. -I love 6:00. Text me your number and we'll sort out the details. Okay. Andrew. Faith. Yes. Oh, my gosh. Hey, maddie, it's me. You've got to call me back. Or you know what? Just meet me at roux & brew for brunch at 10:30. I have news! Bye. Hey. -Hey. -Where are you going? Muffin. I got to buy my own now. Actually, I'm glad I ran into you. I had some ideas about the art program. Oh, good. Me too. Okay, three words for you: District holiday party. You're going to spike the eggnog? No. Maybe. I have to get in front of the school board, and if I can have a face-to-face conversation with them about why the department matters, then it'll make a difference, right? -I was thinking the same thing. -Of course. -So... -[crowd chattering] do you hear that? Is that a flash mob? Somebody's wish is coming true. Come on. [rhythmic clapping] is that-- is that greta, the librarian? [faith] of course she wished to be in a flash mob. [laughs] -oh! -No, no, no, no. -No, me? -[woman] do it! [laughs] [all cheer] I cannot with you. Where did you learn those moves? It was, like, really cool being a part of somebody's wish. Oh, my gosh. So are we still on for later? -We are now. -Cool. I'll see you at your place. -All right, bye. -Bye. You ever ridden in a police car before? That a yes? No, sir. I always wanted to, though. When I was a kid, I even wanted to be a police officer or a rock 'n' roll singer. Some days, both. Well, between the two of us, we did pretty well. Maddie mentioned that you used to be in a band in college. Let me guess: Long hair? I was a drummer. It was in the job description. -Do you still play? -Nah. I haven't picked up the sticks in a long time. Sold the drum kit when the girls were little. Didn't want to add more noise to a house with two toddlers. Do you miss it? Sometimes. But there comes a time in every man's life when he's got to grow up. [keys jingle] -[engine starts] -which one's the lights? [siren blares] oh, I'm sorry. [cacophony of sirens] son... [sirens turned off] buckle up. Hey. Hi. -Hi. -Hi. I think ryan's gonna propose. -What? -Yes. I just found a ring box in his stuff, and then I put it back before he saw me, but I'm freaking out, it's all I can think about. Honey, that's so exciting. Thank you. It's crazy. Anyway, I'm sorry. You. You have news. What's your news? I'm not engaged. [mouthing] with you? It is the coffee shop guy. So you took my advice. I didn't! I was leaving the coffee shop. And, of course, this idiot on a bike flies by, -so I trip. -Of course. Coffee shop guy catches me, and he dips me. He dipped you? It doesn't even sound real, right? Wait. The wish. -Don't be a dork. -Come on. I'm serious. You cannot deny the timing of that, faith. -That's crazy. -Well, we wished for a kiss. I mean, this is a... It's a dinner date. What normally happens at the end of a date? Dessert? -You're so lame. -[both laugh] no, I think you should be open to the possibility that love is in the air. He is lovely. I'm sorry, I didn't order anything. Hi. Do you know him? No. Just a coincidence, I guess? [knock on door] oh, hang on! Just one second. I got to... Surprise, little brother. Grant, what are you doing here? -Uncle wy! -Hey, meg. My gosh, you look so big. -Where's james? -Oh, he's parking the car. Long story, but we're spending the holidays with you. What? Turns out james' dad booked the cruise for December of next year. We were on our way to the airport when they realized the mistake. We couldn't go home, because winter storm meghan is making her debut on the east coast. So we just decided to come here. Uncle wyatt, where's your tree? Hey. Sorry to barge in on you like this. Grant thought it would be exciting and spontaneous to surprise you. For the record, I thought we should call. This is a surprise. -[knock on door] -oh, it's faith. Art teacher faith? Yeah. Hold on. [gasps] -hey. -What's up? You ready to go? -Yeah, I just-- -oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know you had company. Faith, this is my brother, grant. [faith] architect brother? Oh, my gosh, I have heard so much about you. And I, you. And this is his husband, james. -[faith] hi, how are you? -Nice to meet you. [wyatt] and their daughter, meg. I had a dress just like that when I was your age, and it was definitely my favorite. This one's my favorite too. -[wyatt laughs] -wait. I thought you told me you guys were going on an alaskan cruise? Slight change of plans. Yeah, they're spending christmas with me now. -That's better! -[meg] and hanukkah. I get eight times the presents! [james] please don't let us interrupt. We showed up completely unannounced. We were taking this guy to get a christmas tree. You guys should come. It'll be fun. Oh, yeah. The more, the merrier. Well, I mean, this place could use a little more cheer. That is exactly what I was saying. Come on, let's do it, meg. There's my favorite former student. Hey, mrs. Mason. Oh, please. You can call me joyce now. Joyce. Got you. I was hoping you could help me with something. Just between us. -Yeah, what's up? -This. This is your little brother, michael, isn't it? Yes. Ooh, wait, does this mean that he...? I've been selected to grant michael's wish. To see a christmas carol live with your grandfather. He's going to be so excited. I've already bought two tickets to the show in southport. But I wanted to know what else michael liked-- isn't southport, like, a few hours from here? Yes, but the show doesn't start until 7:00 p.M. Yeah, but grandpa lewis can't travel. He's too weak. Oh. He loves dickens. He used to read it to us all the time when we slept over. Nicholas nickleby, oliver twist, copperfield, and-- -a christmas carol. -Yes. I mean, he used to promise to take us to see it live, but it's just been a few years since he's been well. Mm-hmm. I guess it was just on mikey's mind this year. Don't worry. I'll find a way. Remember, I was never here. Got it. [inaudible] [faith] do you think santa put this on the tree? -No. -No? I bet he did. He does all sorts of cool stuff. Hi, miss mason. Merry christmas. Hi, bud. How are you, aiden? Good to see you. Hey, thanks. I'm faith. I'm aiden's art teacher. I'm gwen, and we have heard all about you. Aiden loves your class. He's even asked for easel and paints for christmas, -so he can practice at home. -Did you really? Painting is just another way of keeping a diary. That's pablo picasso. That's one of my favorite quotes of all time. [gwen] all right, hon. Let's pick up a tree so we can get home. -Okay. -I'll see you later. -Bye. -Bye. Whatever you are doing in that class, keep doing it. You have brought out a side of him that we have never seen before. Thank you. -Merry christmas. -You too. Hey. Meg! Excuse me, mrs. Claus. Oh, meg, hey. Oh, hi. It's nice to see you. Yes, hi. -Is santa here too? -Oh, honey, this is not missus-- no, no, no. I'm afraid not. You know, he's very busy this time of year. Why are you here without him? Well, I have a lot to do here every christmas, and we don't want santa to have all the fun, now, do we? [laughs] can you tell him my dads and I are staying with my uncle wyatt. We were supposed to be out on a cruise. I want to make sure he knows where to find me. Luckily, I have a way to reach him. -Magic? -No, something a lot faster. Okay, now, it's "meg is with..." -wyatt. -Wyatt, yes! Message sent. -[wyatt] back. -Oh, hey. Did you get the peppermint brownies? I couldn't tell how many to get, so I got a whole tray. I put the chocolate drizzle on, because I know what you like. -Oh, that looks delicious. -Yeah. I think I'm going to have to go get one myself oh, hey, yeah, they got all kinds of stuff over there, just past the wreaths. Yes. Meg, it was lovely meeting you. And thank you for coming by to say hello. Bye, mrs. Claus. Have a merry christmas. [mary] oh, you too, sweetie. It was very nice seeing you two again. Yeah, nice to see you. Merry christmas. [mary] merry christmas. [faith] hey, who wants to get a christmas tree? -[meg] me! -Me, me, me. But I still want to play games. You two go ahead. We'll catch up. -Okay. I'll see you in a bit -see you, guys. -[meg] okay. -[grant] bye. Oh, let's take a picture of them. [indistinct chattering] [faith] so, what are we looking for, exactly? I feel like if I'm going to get a tree, I want to get something kind of different, you know? Something overlooked. A tree that bucks the system. Okay. I like weird. How about this? How about you go that way. I'm gonna cruise over this way. And if you find something you're just in love with, holler. All right. You're too wide. Too crunchy. And too feathery. Ooh! Looks the same. Aah! Ow! Aah! I am so sorry. No, it's okay. -No, take this. -All right. All right, it's fine. It happens. I don't go around spilling drinks on beautiful women, by the way. I'm glad to know that's not standard procedure. You know, I was looking for the douglas firs. My ex, she used to pick out our tree, so... They're just right over by the front. Oh. Must have missed them on the way in. Just my luck I bumped into you. Not sure I'd call it luck, but I do hope you find what you're looking for. You're probably going to want to wash that. Oh, uh...Okay. Okay. That guy was totally trying to get your number. No, he's just looking for a tree. You don't even work here. I have a very friendly face. Hey, what happened? Are you okay? He burnt me real bad with his hot chocolate. -Who, that guy? -Yeah. -And it was really hot. -May I? Oh, faith, it's red. We got to put a cold compress on it. Am I going to survive? I think so. Hey, you found your perfect tree. Yeah. Yeah, I think I did. Come on. You guys, get this little guy in his new home. [faith] bye, meg! You're not coming in? No. Go have some family time. What? This little guy could use your artistic touch. Well, I can't tonight. I have plans. Hanging with your family? No. I have a date. -Oh. -Yeah. I didn't know you were seeing somebody. I mean, it's like a first date. It's not a big deal, but... -Cool. -I mean, I could cancel. I don't want you to have to fend for yourself with them. No, no, you should go. Really. -Yeah? Okay. -Yeah. Well, I am going by the school tomorrow to clean out the art room, and I'm going to be an emotional mess, so if that sounds like the kind of fun that you're into... You know it. I'll be there. -Thank you. -Yeah. You're the best. -I will see you tomorrow. -All right. -Bye. -See you. Have fun. That's right, 12 costumes. Period appropriate. And I'll need them delivered by tomorrow. Mm-hmm. Yes. I understand it's three days till christmas. [laughs] oh, I appreciate it. No, thank you. What's this? Cast list. A cast list? Michael's grandfather is too ill to travel to the show, so I'm going to bring the show to him. So you're going to stage an entire production of a christmas carol in three days? It's abridged. Very abridged. But it'll still pack a punch. -You and your big ideas. -[laughs] I've already cleared it with father nelson. But he's letting us have a little time before christmas eve service. I've got costumes on the way. I'm going to need all hands on deck. -Sweetheart? -Mm-hmm? Why is my name on this cast list? [laughs] right there. Okay. That's the one. [sighs] you dork. [cell phone vibrates] [doorbell rings] coming. ♪ let's get out of here ♪ ♪ I got a place on the edge of town ♪ lean into the things that make you different, for better or for worse. Well, I'd say it's worked out pretty well for you. That's very nice. Thanks. I want to hear more about you. I have to admit to you, though, I looked at your business card and I did some light internet research. Internet research? Hmm. Yes. It's a very important part of every first date. -Find anything? -No. Because you don't do social media. You also have not been arrested, that I could find. And you were captain of your debate team at stanford. Now you know everything. I have to imagine you had some pretty big opportunities, so how did you end up here? Oh, family practice. Hence "lawson and sons" on my business card. Oh, well, yeah. We open a firm here in August. I'm the second son. And we specialize in contracts, patents, incorporations, that sort of thing. Boring, I know. No, no, no, not boring at all. I mean, not if it's what you love. Yeah. Yeah, and I love it. I could never do what you do. I don't have a single artistic bone in my body, -what? -Much less the patience to teach kids, no. Oh, no, kids are great. Kids, oh, they'll totally amaze you if you give them the chance. I'm going to show you something that will change your mind. You're going to love this. My kids have all been working on these cute little projects for the holidays. Look, check this out. Isn't that sweet? And look at all of these different mediums they use. [andrew] well, that's very... -Interesting? -Yeah! Wait, wait. Your student did that? What, this? No, no, not this one. That was just something I was working on. That's nothing. And have you ever thought about selling your work? I know people who pay a lot of money for a lot less. No. I mean, that's just not why I paint. It's my passion. It's just really, really personal, so... And plus, I love teaching, you know? That's my job. I can't really imagine doing anything else. Well, then it sounds like we're both where we should be. Yeah, sounds like it. She shoots, she scores! Crowd goes wild. She gets some muffins. There you go. -Is that what you brought me? -Yeah. Thank you. -How's it going here? -[sighs] I can't bring myself to throw any of this away. Let's not make today about that. Let's just put things into boxes, okay? -Okay. -Because we both know you're not going anywhere. Okay, I raided mom's storage cabinets... Maddie, this is wyatt. Wyatt, this is my sister, maddie. The wyatt? -I feel like I already know you. -[wyatt] I know. -How's your holiday been? -Really good. Faith helped pick a christmas tree. Oh, which reminds me. I wanted to show you... [faith, gasping] it looks good! -Wyatt, you did a nice job. -Well, grant did most of it. But I did the dinosaur ornaments. [faith] of course you did. -That's my favorite too. -That's a handsome dinosaur. So I wish I could stay and hang, but mom corralled ryan and I into this whole christmas carol thing. Wait, how was your date last night? You were supposed to call me. Oh, I'll get these boxes here. -It was good. -Did you get a good-night kiss? [faith] no, I did not. But he did ask me out again. Okay, well, you're welcome. -For what? -For the wish. -I love you. -I love you back. -I'll see you again, yeah? -All right, hope so. [maddie] yeah. -So that's maddie for you. -She's cool. Yeah. Sounds like you had a good time last night. Yeah, it was fun. I didn't get to play with any dinosaur. Well, next time, maybe. Oh, costumes go to the rectory. Thank you. -Joyce? -Uh-huh. -Joyce? -Yes. I got some notes on some of this dialogue. Notes? You can't change dickens. Yeah, but my character, he's a little mean. Sweetheart, you're playing scrooge. Are you up for an errand? You see, I promised all the thespians christmas cookies. The stage demands sustenance. -Now? -Yeah, come on. We need a break. Let's go. Hey, get out of here. You've gone above and beyond the call of duty today. I'm wiped. All right. [sighs] and it was portrait week. Aww. [faith] look at these sweet little faces. Was that one supposed to be you? [faith] honestly, I've never looked better. [laughs] wyatt, these kids need us. We've got to make tonight count. Tonight? The district holiday party. -Is that tonight? -Don't! I made this so easy on you. I put it in your calendar. -I'm just kidding. -Don't do that to me! I told you, I always got your back. -You know I'll be there. -Thank you. Of course. You sure you're good? -Mm-hmm. -All right, see you tonight. Can't wait. [indistinct chattering] robert! That's him! Hey, mrs. Mason. Hi, talia. What a beautiful day for a walk. It really is. This is my little brother, michael. -And this is our grandpa lewis. -Hey, how are you? -Hi. -And, mike, this is your art teacher's mom and dad. Miss mason's cool. She lets me get as messy as I want in her class. [talia] we're out christmas shopping for our parents. And then once we get home, we're going to have some cake. It's his birthday on christmas eve. Oh, well, happy birthday, grandpa lewis. I hope you get everything you wish for, and more. [laughs] well, it was great seeing you. You too. Well, let's go. Pressure's on, ebenezer. [cell phone vibrates] andrew, hey. Yeah, I could meet you. Of course. Okay, I'll see you there. -Hey. -Hey. Have you seen tiny tim's crutch? I can't find it anywhere. No, sorry. But maybe it's in the back room. You want to come with? Something I want to show you. Okay, sure. [indistinct chattering] okay. Just wait right here. Okay. What's going on? What do you think? It's beautiful. I was hoping you'd say that. Wait, I'm sorry, what's going on? This is my idea for the ghost of christmas past. We can drape his robe in lights. Oh, look, there's the crutch. Oh. Yeah, great. Thank you. So should I pitch the lights to your mom, or not? Hi. Well, look at you. Already breaking the "wait three days" rule. I think I'm rubbing off on you. I'm leaving tomorrow on a ski trip, and I really want to see you again. I thought maybe if you weren't doing anything tonight, we could have another spontaneous dinner. Oh, no, I've got this school work thing that I have to do. It's okay. It was short notice. Yeah. And... I wanted to give you something. [laughs] what? You got me a present? That's-- it's so-- it's so soon. I saw these and immediately thought of you. Go ahead, open it. Okay. [faith] oh, wow! [laughs] you saw this and thought of me? I thought it could be a useful too. -Yeah. -You like it? Yeah, it gives me an awful lot to think about. Thank you. I'm going to grab some coffee. I'll be right back. Thank you. [sighs] oh! Aah! Sorry. -I am so sorry. -Really? Oh, hi. What are the odds? I have no idea. I just came to get some gingerbread men. My ex, you know, she-- can you just please hand me a napkin? It's... Oh, let me help you. Yeah. Oh, thanks very much. Yup. See? Now we all have one for santa to fill up when he comes. I love it. Just what the place needed. And to complete the festivities. You brought a menorah? We were supposed to be on the open seas until new years. All right, meg. We've had a big day. Why don't you go put on a movie, then bath time. Elf or home alone? Elf. Let's do it. And how was your day? Oh, do I sense some subtext? I don't know. Should there be subtext? That's what friends do. Faith would have done the same. Is that all you two are? Friends? Yes. She's dating some guy named andrew, anyway. Well, you got a year plus on whoever this andrew is. So if you wanted to make a move... It's not happening, grant. Stop meddling. But I do it so well. All right, I'm taking a shower. I got a work thing. Faith and I are going to try to appeal to the school board. Bit of a hail mary, but could work. Back up. This work thing, is that code for holiday party? Maybe. Why do you have that funny look on your face? [indistinct chattering] [faith] this feel like some sort of weird prom to you? [maddie] not in that dress. There they are. Hey. Looks like we both brought backup. -Hi. -Whoa, who's this businesswoman, and what have you done with my friend, faith? It's for the kids. You look fantastic. [grant] tonight, my name is tomas, an art gallery owner looking to set up a scholarship for teens. That's good, right? Okay, just don't make it worse. Grant, this is my sister, maddie. Tonight, I'm playing the role of the supportive sister who's never met a party she doesn't like. Oh, we're going to get along just fine. -[laughs] -[faith] okay. We are going to create organic conversation. We have to stay on message. Art is not disposable. So should we split up? I feel like we'll cover more ground that way. Are we ready to do this? -One, two, three. -[all] break! Principal wilson, hi. Happy holidays. Oh, same to you. -Faith, this is-- -guy woodbury. How are you? School board member. You started off in the world of finances, then shifted over into education when you wanted to get more involved with your children's schooling. I read it online. Faith is our art teacher. Yes. Did you take art growing up? No. Art was never my thing. I'm more a facts and numbers guy. That's good too. I'm really hoping this scholarship will encourage young artists to think about art not just as a hobby, right, but as a possible career. Did you know that there is a direct correlation between kids in the arts, and academic performance? I mean, those are hard facts to ignore. Thank you. Merry christmas. Oh, how do you feel about art in schools? -Hey. -Hey. Hope you had better luck than I did. Everybody's a-wassailing and no one wants to talk about work. I'm sure it wasn't as bad as you said. Hang on there. We'll keep trying, all right? Okay, everybody, it's time to slow it down christmas-style. [jazzy christmas music plays] come on, let's show these squares how it's done. [laughs] I'm glad you came tonight. Of course. I got your back. Always. ♪ snow falls on this town ♪ ♪ the tree's already trimmed ♪ ♪ and the lights are almost up ♪ hey, faith. I've been meaning to ask you. I've been wanting to ask you. Oh, my gosh. -Marilyn. -Oh, hi. [faith] marilyn culver-simpson. No, don't be obvious. She's the head of the school board. Like, if I could just get one minute with her. You know what? Follow my lead. It's a really good turnout this year. Principal wilson, the caterer wanted to talk. Something about an eggnog emergency? Oh, I'll just be a minute. -[marilyn] oh, sure. -Right this way. Hi. I'm not sure that we've met. I'm faith mason. I'm the art teacher at ponchatoula junior high. -Hi, I'm marilyn-- -culver-simpson. -I know. -Oh, I suppose you do. -Well... -We considered all of the upsides of the program before we made our decision. -It wasn't easy. -I know. It's... It's just that art isn't just about the art. I can't even begin to tell you how many of these kids have opened up just because they've picked up a paintbrush and felt free enough to express themselves. Well, I have to say, art was my favorite class in school. -Great! -I remember walking around with this little sketchbook all the time. And at christmastime, my grandma and I would sit in the park and we would draw the ice-skaters. Oh, I haven't thought about that in so long. I would really love to show you some work that the kids have been doing. I've got pictures, if you'd like to take a look. Yeah, sure. Great. Landscape paintings right now, which is great, because they can articulate feelings without being literal, you know?

Hi, miss culver-simpson. -What happened? -I'm sorry. That was nothing. I was just hoping we could finish our conversation. Maybe we should get you dried off first. -What? No, I'm-- -hi, neighbor. I didn't know you'd be here. -This can't be happening. -Your friend had something spilled on her. -It's okay. -Marilyn, sorry to interrupt, but there's someone I want you to meet. -Miss mason... -I... Hey. It's okay. It's just a spill. It's a spill. I'll be right back. [applause] faith? -Faith, wait. -What? [sighs] I don't want to do this anymore. At first, it was kind of fun. And now it's like this wish is ruining everything. -Okay, what can I do to help? -I don't know. What is this? Is it bad karma? It is just, like, awful christmas magic? Because right now, the only thing that I wish is that I had never put that wish in the box. Okay, well, let's take it back. We'll go back to the park, put a new wish in. It'll be like this one never happened. I already put a wish in. You know the rules. You did, but I didn't. I got you into this mess. Let me get you out of it. [indistinct chattering] faith? Wait, where's the box? I don't know. It's always right here. Well, it's not christmas, so it should be here still. -Look around. -Okay. -Did you find it? -No, didn't find it. Did you? No. Maybe it got kicked under here and got lost. Or stolen. [sighs] [maddie] morning, just checking in. Any luck finding the box? Pulling footage from the park. Should shed some light. I really hope it turns up. I mean, in all the years we've been granting wishes, it's never gone missing. Whoever took it must have had a really good reason. Yeah, probably made a wish they wanted to take back. Well, I'm heading out. And I'll let you know if I find anything. -Good luck. -I'll make some calls. [computer chimes] hey, don't worry. It'll turn up. What's someone going to do with a box of wishes anyway? -Mads. -Yeah? A thought. What if I don't need the box? You know, there's got to be another way to reset this. There's so many ways to make a wish, which means there should be more than one way to break it. You think that'll work? There's only one way to find out. ♪ we wish you a merry christmas ♪ ♪ we wish you a merry christmas ♪ ♪ we wish you ♪ ♪ a merry christmas ♪ ♪ and a happy new year ♪ me? Great. [camera shutters click] [inaudible] ♪ we wish you a merry christmas ♪ yeah? I get off in an hour. Do you want to grab a coffee? I cannot believe I got hit on at the north pole. That's not romantic. I don't think that's cute. I don't like getting stuff spilled on me. I don't like being tripped just so you can catch me. I really don't like being ogled at, because direct eye contact is an intimate thing. You have to earn it. I don't like people getting into my bubble. And you know what I really don't like? When people touch me without permission. That's not romantic. That's creepy. Right? You know? Do you know what is romantic? Like, boring stuff. Stability. Loyalty. Laughing at my dumb jokes. If you know my coffee order... [sighs] ...That's the real magic. I'm so sorry that I made you put the wish in the box. I love you so much, but there is not a kiss in the whole, wide world that is worth all of this. I literally don't even know what to believe anymore. Well, maybe you just need to get through a few more frogs before you get to your prince. I mean, we did say not just a kiss. It has to be a true love's kiss, so... Maddie, that's it. A true love's kiss is the only thing that will end all of this. We just have to fulfill the wish. Okay, then let's go catch him. Who? Andrew. The cute guy you've been dating. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, him, that'll work. He's leaving town. We got to move it. Andrew! Hey! Faith. Hi. What a surprise. Yeah, well, I wanted to say goodbye. And I wanted to tell you to have a very safe trip. And hurry back. And you came all this way to tell me that? Yes. And to do this. I am so sorry, I can be very impulsive sometimes. -That's quite all right. -Okay. Good. [car horn honks] sorry, I really need to get going. But I would love to see you when I get back. Great. When you get back. -Yes. -Merry christmas. Merry christmas. Bye. [sighs] -have fun. -[engine starts] wish officially broken. Well? Do you feel any different? Maybe. Do you think it worked? It sure feels like it worked. I've never done this before, but I just had to say hello, and would you ever want to go out sometime? No? No. -Not even a coffee? -No. No. [knock on door] nobody's home. [wyatt] hey, it's me, wyatt. Hold on. -Hi. Come in, come in. -Hey. I'm so glad it's you. I have had a day. -Oh, yeah? -Mm-hmm. What's going on? Actually, I wanted to talk to you about something. Oh, I do not want to talk about last night at the party. -I'm sorry I stormed out. -No, no, it's not about that. Well, it kind of is, actually. All right, get comfortable. I'll grab us some beers. You know what? I think I'm going to stand, if that's all right. What's going on? You never miss an opportunity to get comfortable. Oh, man, this is harder than I thought it was going to be. What is it? It's me. You can tell me anything. Faith, you know you're my best friend. And I love our relationship. Yeah. Me too. But lately, I've been wondering if we could be more than that. If we could be more than just friends. [sighs] oh, no. Not you too. No, no, it's my fault. I should have told you-- okay, this is going to sound crazy, but you need to understand that in a few days, you won't feel this way, okay? You don't want me. You're confused, and there's stuff happening-- no, I'm not. Look, I-- I know I was seeing someone when we first met. You and I worked together, so it kind of put me in the friend zone. But, faith, I'm in love with you. Oh, I can't believe that this is happening. It's okay if you don't feel the same way. No, wyatt. Okay, none of this is real. Listen to me. What you're feeling for me, what you think that you're feeling for me, it's like this big cosmic joke that's gone so wrong, and I don't know what to do. I should probably go. Wyatt, just understand-- no, I feel like you've been pretty clear. Stop! Stop. I'm sorry. I'm sorry too. [door closes] [faith] I don't even remember what I said, but I remember how I felt. And I remember the look on his face. Maybe he's telling the truth. I mean, he's known you longer than all those other guys, so maybe he's, like, immune to whatever's happening. If he really, really felt that way, then why bring it up now? I mean, it is highly suspicious timing. [cell phone vibrates] hi, daddy. Yeah, mad's here with me now. Why? Really? Okay. We'll meet you at the park. [sighs] they found the box. [police radio chatter] dad. Hey. What's going on? I think you might know these two. Their parents are on the way. Caught them trying to put the box back. Hey, aiden, stella, over here. You guys want to tell me what's going on? We're really sorry, miss mason. We always planned to put the box back, I swear. Yeah, and all the wishes are safe inside. Faith, you might want to look at this. Looks like they were trying to do a good thing. We heard about what's happening to the art program. We just wanted to try and save it. We had already put wishes in, so we wanted to take them out and replace them with new ones. -Some of the other kids did too. -[aiden] we love your class. It's the best part of our day. Bud, it's the best part of my day. Come here. Thank you. Are we going to jail? Mm... I think that now that this box is back safe and sound, we can just forget it ever happened. I know that look. What are you planning? I'm just saying, if the school board can't see the value in the art department, maybe we have to show them. -You guys in? -[both] yeah. Hey, mom, it's me. Look, I really need your help with something. Spread the word, mr. Porter. We are putting on a little art show at the christmas eve service tomorrow night. Show off just what these kids can do. Everyone's welcome to our art show tomorrow night. Thank you. Thank you. Please come to our art show. Here's a flier to our art show on christmas eve. I guess we'll drop some off. Thank you. -Have you got? -Yeah, I've got it. [sighs] right about here. Thank you. Thanks for coming. Hey, merry christmas. What's going on, bud? Good to see you. Grab your favorite brushes. [indistinct chattering] every single one of you is getting a wish that was not selected from the wish box this year to feature in your artwork. I want you to remember a couple of things. Take your time. The best pieces of art all throughout history weren't just images. They were stories that people told. So I want you guys to think about how you can tell the emotional story of your wish. Does that make sense? Yeah? All right, cool. Grab your paints. Grab your brushes. If you need anything, you just holler for me, okay? All right, get to it. Hey, meg, race you to the cider stand? Okay. Go. You're supposed to say, "one, two, three, go." you want to talk about it? No. Not really. It's just, I don't understand what happened. I thought we had such a moment at the christmas party. Maybe I misread the situation. You two have more chemistry than an atomic bomb. Look, you did the right thing. You had to tell her how you felt. And as for her reaction? Was she scared? I don't know why you waited so long to tell her. Scared to mess up a good thing? Stop making sense. This is love we're talking about. You have to be willing to risk everything to get it in return. Well, well, well. I knew she'd think of something. All right, now, what do you want to get? [ryan] okay, robert, merry christmas eve. All right, it's from one musician to another. Oh. [joyce] that is so cool. I figured you could put those to good use. Well, these are great. So, has everyone opened a christmas eve gift now? No, ryan hasn't. Whoa, whoa, wait, wait. Here. Let me. Last, but not least. Is something wrong? I'm sure whatever's in this box is great, but there's really only one thing I want this christmas. [sighs] I wasn't sure when or how to do this. The moment just never felt perfect enough. But the truth is, as long as I'm with you, everything's perfect. And I know you found the box. You put it back in a different pocket. [all laugh] I'm sorry. It was an accident. I hope I didn't ruin it. [ryan] only if you say no. I know this isn't some horse-drawn carriage, or a big fireworks display in the sky. But as I've watched you this week, I realize that sharing how much I love you with the people you love the most was just right. Madeline marie mason, will you make me the happiest man in the world and be my wife? Yes. Yes. [laughs] [joyce] yay! Thank you. Oh, it's so pretty. I'm so happy for you. -[joyce] sassy! -[maddie] it does fit. [indistinct chatter] I can't believe we pulled this off. Well, christmas is all about family. And that's what ponchatoula is. One big family. Hey, would you guys mind going, just talking to some of the kids and mingling and speaking loudly and enthusiastically about the art? Thank you. I love you. -Hi. -This is incredible. -Huh? Oh, hi! -Hey. Hey, I didn't know if you were coming. Are you kidding me? I wouldn't miss this. Plus, I wanted to give you this. Wyatt. I got you something, but I didn't bring it here. I didn't know if we were... It's all right. We're good. Hey, you know what? I'm going to hang on to this. Why don't you go save the art program. [inaudible] you got this. -I'll see you. -All right. Okay. Hi, miss culver-simpson. Thank you so much for being here. Hi. Look, it's my wish. My husband and I have been so busy this year, I was hoping maybe we could find some time to slip away together. Just us. It's perfect. These kids poured their hearts into this artwork, because they love it, you know? It really matters to them. Really, it matters to our whole town. I can tell. Hi, miss culver-simpson. Oh, hi. We wanted you to have this. We heard you were an artist too. Merry christmas. Thank you so much. This is so special. [faith] I'll see you guys in a little bit? -Bye. -Bye. Some of these kids were really shy when I first met them. But art has given them the opportunity to connect with one another and to open up. And I know that you have a really tough job. You have to make tough decisions. But this isn't one of them. These kids gave you your wish. I really hope you can give them theirs. Hi. [indistinct chatter] hey, hi. Have you seen wyatt? I have some good news that I want to give him. No, I haven't. Sorry. Oh. Hey, wyatt left this. -He wanted me to give it to you. -Great. Okay. Are you going to open it? Well, it's not christmas. I really think you should open it. Okay. "you give so much of yourself to others. I want to be the one to give back to you." [gasps] okay. What? [maddie] these are so you. Wyatt has good taste. Or he spent hours in the store asking every lady who came in what she thought. It was really cute. He really did that? Maybe he was telling the truth. Maybe he really does have feelings for you. Or maybe he's wanted to ask you out for months. I'm sorry, I thought he told you. He did. He did. Oh, I mean, he tried to tell me, but I...I told him he was confused. I told him that his feelings weren't real. [grant] oh, it's real. It wasn't the wish. Maybe it was. Like maybe this is how it was always supposed to be. Maybe I was supposed to finally see what has been in front of me this whole time. I have to go. I'm going to go find him. Merry christmas. [applause] [joyce] good evening, everyone. Father nelson was kind enough to let us doing a little something special before the service. We have a wish recipient amongst us. Actually, it's a wish for a whole family. One that I've come to know personally. Would michael mills please come up? [audience murmurs] [applause] michael, what was your wish this year? To see a christmas carol live with my grandpa lewis. -He's right there. -[joyce] I see him. Well, we're here to grant that wish. How'd you like to be our tiny tim? God bless us, everyone! [all laugh] not yet. Enjoy the show. [applause] a merry christmas, uncle. God save you. [robert] bah! Humbug! Christmas isn't humbug, uncle. I hope that's meant as a joke. I said humbug! No joke. [sighs] are you going to make a wish? Oh. Hi. No, I don't think so. Four hours until christmas, and there's still a lot of magic left. I don't think a slip of paper is going to solve my problems. I don't know if a wish will solve your problems. But when we make a wish, for that brief moment you were honest with yourself about the things that are truly important to you. And the magic of christmas is what you decide to do with that honesty. Come on, take a chance. What's the harm? The truth is, I did take a chance, and it didn't really work out so well for me. Are you sure about that? [faith] wyatt. Hey. What are you doing here? [faith] I hoped you'd be here. I'm glad I found you. Thank you. For my shoes. I love them. They're perfect. You weren't supposed to open those till christmas. -I know. I'm a mess. -[laughs] so I just wanted to be really honest with you, because you deserve that. The last few days have been just strange and confusing and overwhelming. And I feel like I have been pulled in a thousand different directions. But every single one of them led back to you. But, I thought you said-- I know, I know, I know. I'm scared. I'm, like, really scared... Because you're my best, best friend. And I don't want to mess it up. But the truth is, you've always been more than my friend. And I should have admitted it before. But I'm in love with you too. [laughs] what is this? Oh, it's nothing. Are you making a wish? -Did I interrupt? -No. I can leave. Let me see it. You've always been my wish, faith. You busy? Now? You want to help me with something? Yeah. [indistinct chattering] [faith] oh, she said yes? [faith, narrating] well, I guess it's true what they say. Anything is possible at christmas. Magic or no magic, you just have to believe it can come true. I got my wish this year. Here's to hoping that you get yours.
