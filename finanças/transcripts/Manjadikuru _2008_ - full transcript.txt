People often ask me where I come from. I tell them the name of the tiny village somewhere in the backwoods of Kerala. I was not born in this area, has not grown and do not live there. But I belong to this land, it belongs to me. The roots of hope for the earth. Wood relies on the roots. Sheet relies on a tree. Green fetus relies on the sheet. Ripe fruit relies on green fruit. Seeds of hope for ripe fruit. Land trusts in seeds. Transfer film Oksanchic In this country, never better not be. The roots of trees on the road. Everything must be cut down and asphalt. How did Dubai. To get the spare tire should be replaced. Harry! - Harry? - Yes What are you doing? Come here. What is it, dear? You udumal it? Hurry get in the car! So what? Is not that was my first job abroad? Terminate vary pozority! Get in the car, he would. Good. Who are they? Daughter and son-in-law of Kaustubamov. Oh! From Dubai.

It is the job of the driver, not yours, right? - Okay - How can you be so stupid ?! The Daughter and son-in-law is my mom and dad. I was one among their countless luggage. Their only son. Almost 11-year-old. Vicky. Viki! Come on, get in the car! Our arrival in this small village was a great event. Many years ago there was a very different era. Before Kerala has become a country of the gods. Without modern television series, traffic jams .. ... Elections and voting, mobile phones. It was Kerala, which was not even ice cream! Sudzha, we got to your house. Sudzha I otnesu luggage. Kaustubam where my mother was born. The political capital of our family. The family is big. 4 daughters and 2 sons. Girl! Yes? Postoronisy!

Tasteless food, seasoned with silly traditions. The house's funeral. The girl, be quiet. Stop making me hungry! So I get ready for exams like the devil! Well, why is it so? How are you, my child? All came to the funeral? Almost all. You know that our uncle and his son Balu live here. Have you heard? Our older brother showed up after 10 years! Kto? Murals? Yes! The one who escaped to become a Naxalite. Hush! It is not for the ears of outsiders. My husband comes from Delhi. He has a meeting with the governor, so he was a little delayed. It is not easy to find the time when you're a government official. And what about the others? Sujata and her husband had just arrived from Dubai. Then there was Sheila, she works as a teacher in Madras. But her husband, she is unemployed. So they could with the baby arrive early. More Raghu, he lives next door. The youngest, Sudha, lives in America. She just called and said that he would come tomorrow. Raghu is the one that has filed a lawsuit against your father? It is true that he sued .. It's time to gossip? Girl, please, carry away the glasses. -Ammu! - I'm coming! I'll be back soon. Maybe they do not like to hear it, .. ... But we came here only to fight for the house.

Hey, I swear by the gods and tell me .. ... You like to share your machine, if I asked? No! Never! So why ask? Sugi, please, can I go to bed? Not until you can wash a face mask! What is it, Vicki? What kind of dirty socks! Did not I tell you not to go out without shoes? Like some kind of redneck! Mummy .. Who are the boy with the girl? Which? Who live in a small house. You mean the house that for the thickets? Vicki, do not communicate with them. They are children of Raghu. Useless bunch. He sweetly singing, talking with his sister, so he went to the wrong house.

No one that night could not sleep. There were many reasons. Unbearable heat. Mosquitoes. Crying baby. Grief. Avarice. Guilt. Earlier in the corridors of the house echoed the voice of his grandfather. But now ... Until that day I had never seen a corpse. Except for wool in the nose, there is no much difference. Sorry! Sudha come only for dinner. There are now all solved those from America and Dubai? Ritual washing is necessary to make immediately. That's all I wanted to say. Should we not ask the older son? He is standing there like a confessor. Let's ask. The body is only an attribute. But as long as it exists, we have to treat it with respect. A convincing argument. Satisfied? What do we do now? Listen to me. It is necessary for the body to find the ice. Good. Marimutu! It was given to my great-uncle of the Maharajas. For Dubai it would be old-fashioned. Right? Sure! You're not done yet? Spate of work! Finish faster. Uncle, something we have brought to the funeral home. What is the need? We do not need them. Her husband then it uses that apply to us in court. Hari, let's go, please. Sure What did he do there? Come with me better. Sudzha law. As you say. What's your name, son? Viki Who do you think, in front of you? How touching! The brother of your mother - Raghu. And this is - his dear wife. Such harmony in the family. In what class are you? In the fifth. In the class B. My son - the same age as yours. Kannan. Did you eat? Sit down And in all this hustle and bustle of all completely forgotten about my grandmother. My dear grandmother who baked cakes for me. Please drink, Mum. Get out of the way, girl! Vile creature. Steep here about my mother. There was no one who would have helped, and therefore ... I come every year, but did not see you here. Why would this concern about my mother? Maybe you're mad at Raghu, but do not take it out on me. Pozhalu–πsta, pomolchi. Mama, we all arrived. We'll take care of you. Have a drink a little, Mom. Apparel for the funeral in the closet. Father ... apparel. Raghu, apparel brought. Sir, I brought the ice. I put the house. Ok Awaiting the arrival of her daughter from America. All these rituals of bathing eyewash. In terms of? Just will wash and disinfect the body. Bring me something to drink. Less glass could not find? So where did the grain! Your? I'm lost in thought about .. ... Why did she put the grain in the grandfather's arm. Specify the path of the body. Take away the child, while I did not. What are you watching! Go! So, Kannan and Manikutti. Make friends with his older brother? Older brother? Yes, it is beneath me! So what? He, like you, in the 5th grade and older than you. Here, Vicki, drink. Let's see who is first on the right. How hard little brother Vicky! Shorty required "Horlicks" (* brand milk) to grow. Like any hero offended I longed for revenge. What are some things - and the consequences of such. Father! Oh, father! Aunt Sudha - the star of the drama of our family. The American came. And her husband did not come? He called saying that he could not. Even her mother could not beat in the views. Brother, do not have a slingshot in a stable. I know. This is the handiwork of the little man. Do not be angry, we'll find her. Do not get in the way. We hid his car yesterday. So what? He can now steal my slingshot? Brother Vicki probably joking. Brother Viki? So you're on his side? Come on, go to him! No, I'm on your side. But my mother said that we should make friends with him. Who is he? Stupid from Dubai. But suddenly everything became totally unneeded. "Horlicks" for the baby Vick. Mosquitoes may bite baby Vicki! Too sunny for the baby Vicki! Hey, you! Stop! Where are you my affairs slingshot? I threw it into the bushes. You have me for it get! Come on. Cremation postponed until tomorrow? Yes. The sun is almost village and Sudha also very tired. I said that should not have to wait. By zavtrashemu day it will have 48 hours! Do not fuss, Raghu. It's okay if you wait Sure! People here like to wait ... especially young women with money. I'm sorry, I forgot! Do not forget, you are now so easily speak of the soul of his father. Raghu, come with me They do not understand! Go Nobody cares what I say. Brother. You stay here Brother Brother, let's go. Let us look for tomorrow No! I want today! Boy What are you doing here? Who is it? This is me ... you do not know me? Who is it? I'm not gone. I'm still with you. Get out, whoever you may be! Do not shout! You hid the red beans in my hands. Oh, Grandpa! Manikum, run! For the first time in my life I escaped from the image of a "good boy." I do not follow my mother's rules. And I loved it! Perelivisty Rogen laughter still rings in my ears. In an instant, I had a new friend. Yes, operator, please connect me. I arrived in the morning. It's horrible! It's so hot! I'm really tired. Hello? Disunite. I forgot how hot it is here. Soon the monsoon season begins. In America, it must have air conditioning everywhere, right? Of course, there is a completely different world. Cremation will be tomorrow. Uncle here, you can ask him. One minute Hello? Jay, good evening. No, good morning. Sure! Sudha me like a daughter. My son Balu here, he told her, too, throughout the help. Who is it ?! Father .. are you ?? This is your daughter, Amma. Do not do anything to me, please. I know you did not like that I have sold the house of Radha. Please, spare me. I will no longer do anything that you do not like. I forgive you. If you're going to cook the children milk pudding. Milk pudding? I'll make whatever you want, Father. Vicki! Where's the baby? I'll make milk pudding for children. Sister? With whom are you talking in the bathroom? Who is it? Grandmother? Please spare me ... Sister, it's me, Sudzha. Please come out and talk. Get out He left? Who is left? My father came to see me. Just. Do not talk rubbish! Wait ... believe me! He was just here! He came to the children. And now he prisleduet me. I'm scared! Why would my father went with you to the bathroom? What do you think? What do you and he can fool me? Both of you - my friends. But you too teased him. He does not know anybody here, and he was always alone. You just want more of it to get a candy bar. I never ate the chocolate, which he gave me. It would be great if you were reconciled and became friends. Friends? Why would he be friends with us? He's from Dubai. Maybe because you're smarter than him. I'll think about it. Kannan and Manikum want to be friends with you. Why is that? Because you're smarter than they are. Smarter? Very smart! Again, the trick? No! Women possess the art of fog envelop the facts. If you want to make friends. For the first time in my life I really wanted. Did you see the mango tree in the backyard? Come back in the evening. Like most men, would I could not refuse? Well? Shorty does not come? Coward! Let's see. And yet .. I have to have something to eat. It's his chocolate! I do not want. Well, do not eat. We Manikutti divide it. You do not even know how to open it! How to divide it into three equal parts? It is a lesson in mathematics? You can divide it into four. Go. Go. Manikutti. Kannan. Idemte Where have you been? What is on your face? Harry? She was just a girl on an errand. The poor soul tossing baby from the heart ... ... Responsible adult. Oh, my lord! My lord, my heart hurts. Best of hosts. Best of lords. Death took him from us. He disappeared from our eyes. My dear sir. Without it, the good times are over for us. Our happiness is gone. Without it, all gone. All the flowers wilted. All the odors have disappeared. My dear sir. The ceremony should carry out an older brother. I'm the only son. Father! Dear father! Perhaps they were very different from each other .. ... But something invisible ties them together. Something that did not bind them in good times. Why did they go there? Quiet. There they will be cremated. What? Burn it. They have it and my father did. Brother Brother, look - mango. How did he die? Grandpa? Old and ill. No, not him. Your father. Your father. Father were transported milk. The truck knocked him off his bicycle. How much are you going? Many Vicky, let's go fish. Once! Two! Three! Wow! Rog, sister ... This for my mother. Black - for the older son in law. And this for you and brother Hari And for whom? For Raghu. Put them together. I myself give him. Vicki will not drink regular milk. Give him a "Horlicks", which I brought from Dubai. Why are these green algae? Fish feed on them. I read in a scientific book. Science book for the third grade? Viki synok, Hold. Who today first right? Girl! I do not believe! I'm looking for you everywhere! And you're here with the children play? You paid for it really? ≈†evelis π, tupica! -Devochka? -Yes Legal Counsel Balaraman Nair came. He wants to know when you want to announce the testament. It is better to read it when everyone assembled. Such questions must be addressed by all family members. The rest should not interfere. In-law rights. And even then some may sue. I forgot! Some have done this way here just for the sake to hear what is said in the will. Do not you dare talk to me! Sister ... what is it? At such times, you are both tuned to the abuse? There is no point in sentimentality Someone has to be practical. Sure Let sawed the house and sell it piece by piece now! Almost! That's not the point ... Some leave on the 4th day of the funeral rites. Then it is better on the 4th day and read. I'll be on the fourth day. It will be better this way. Lawyer ... A will can be read out on the 16th day. Ammu? It's impossible! My husband should leave on the 4th day! He's such an important post! You can not leave the affairs of the government. Is not it? Yes. Announce on the 16th day - right. Then I go back to the 16th day. What does this Mean Girls doing here ?! Ceases to listen and get out! On the road! Poetic image of the perfect couple ... ... In a perfect Eden. Hey guy! You are allowed to swim only 20 minutes! 20 minutes? During this time, I can not and legs dunk. Do not try to be clever here! Milksop. Steps for girls! Come and dive over there. Mommy! Lord! It seems he can not swim. How did it happen? He jumped and began to sink. It looks like he's an asthmatic. Mother! Sindhu, sister! Stay! Ball, brother, stop it! No! I tell her why you kicked out of the house uncle. Bastard! Sindxu! Vicki, open your eyes Son Son ... what happened? Son My son has asthma. These children - a real headache. Baloo, you were not here or what? He jumped! Kid wondered whether better little brother Vicki. I thought I lost it. My poor baby is so suffocating! Mommy, I choke it now I am sure that those children are to blame. My child did not guessed to jump. Mommy, they have not done anything! I'll jump! So said Baloo.

Won! Go How do you feel? Fine Kannan Where? Events Sit down You could say that you can not swim. You did not ask. I thought it would be easy. What brother Balu was thrown out of his uncle's house? He tried to kiss her cousin. It seems, too, hence his throw. Look Lay a place Mom will swear. And he's still not real. Oh, you beast! Did not I tell you to stay away from my son ?! Mummy, do not! Silence! She was lying on your bed! You are a dirty servant! How dare you forget about it? Chertoff servants! Another spoke to my son, and I'll throw you out of here! Ubiraysya! And what are you doing here? Get out! Damn kids! I told you not to talk to them! How dare you disobey ?! You should be flogged for this! Mammy Rog! She's ... she's just a girl! ABOUT! And I did not know what it is - "just a girl"! Teach me to even think ?! Shut up and sit here! Rog! It's chili ... tears from him forever. Forgive me For what? And you're about it ... Irrelevant. This is not the first time. And certainly not the last. While I will not "good girl." I like you just the way it is. Truth? Shake the tree and you will find a small red seeds. Grains were green, now turned red. May they forever remain red. Colorful dragonfly flew ... ... Together with the cool breeze. They flew together? Let's sing and dance. Shake the tree and you will find a small red seeds. Grains were green, now turned red. May they forever remain red. Let us pray for the soul of the deceased, and will let let it rest. They are having fun at the funeral of his grandfather! I think it was last year. When I met with the governor in Trivandrum. My brother always talking about you. He says that you always help in difficult times. When I met with the governor in Trivandrum ... Today, the fourth day of the funeral ceremonies. Now, here I am the oldest. This is my son Balu. When it is financially stable .. ... I can go to my brother. And he's already graduated? He never studied. But although he is bad in terms of training, .. ... It is better than any know how to communicate with people. Can he try his hand at sales or marketing? Yes, this is the most suitable. Brother, can tea? No It is easy to escape from all the worries. But I can not. Unni, please help me. Let's see. Amma, I want to take a bath. Girl When did you last see your father? Last year on vacation. He always says about you. What did he say about me? He said that you have a good heart. And you're always helping those who need help. Our ball. He passed on the driver's license and applied for a passport. What are the prospects for the work in the Gulf now? Oh ... not very good. Brother! Enough! Poor Rog. She has to work all the time. And at this time we swim, we play and do what we want. It is not fair. That's because it is - the maid, and we are not. It is not Rog wanted to be a servant. It's her mother needed money, so she sent her to work. So much work for such ridiculous money. And now her uncle refuses to take her home. And she is no money. Where are they? Their uncle takes Marimutu. He says he takes them to her mother, and who knows? I think there is only one way out. She must escape. Like in the movies! Are you crazy? Brother, the fish did not move. Rog, sister, we fish died. Who said it was a fish? The brother said so. This is not a fish, and tadpoles. Big difference! Fish or tadpoles, but they died. What happened? They died. Hardly born, and already dead? How they deal in fish? They're not grown at the fish market, as you are. Right. Sudzha says that when I buy fish, my eyes like a fisherman. Not only the eyes, and even smell! Do you like? This is a new cologne, which I bought Sudzha. You are not going to hold a funeral? We ought to throw a grand! Suddenly tadpoles also made a will. Why is our fish died? All creatures are killed if they do not give to live at home. Only insensitive human beings are torn from their homes to escape. Oh my God! I can not stand this infernal heat! In the United States have never been so hot does not happen! Pregnant useful walk. It's time to make a move. Maybe they bathe? Let us not torture them. Poor fish Not fish and tadpoles. Boys suffer body. What is she mumbling? Hush! This is for their souls. And the fish have a soul? They do not fish and tadpoles. We need a fire. Wait a minute. All state of the family to share. There was only a question of inheritance of the house. We all have a part of the inheritance, but the house is important. My father always gave me to understand that he wants me to live here. I do not much care about the house. I for an apartment in New Delhi can not find workers. I think if I did not pick up that little girl with him to Delhi. Who? Rogen? Hush! I think Sheila also put it on her. Sheila can not afford to hire a maid. And she is not too young? So what? Plow horse. And children do not need to pay a lot. Enough food and clothing. And they are happy. But this girl - solid problem! When she leaves here, everything will change. My husband knows how to knock out of the shit ... rods. I thought he prefers for these cases the belt. Not with me. This servant need discipline. If not for the visa, I would take her with him. I have to talk to him about it until he left. You're the eldest, so you have to ignite. He was right. I was the eldest. Because it was my duty to save her. There was only one way to do it. The water bath is ready. If we took that girl, it would be such a help to me. And why did you need? Behind the house you can not follow. The work can not be found. Only shlyaeshsya the kitchen all day and smell like onions and garlic. Think what you want, but it does not bother me and my daughter Get away! What a stink! I'll leave for Delhi. Do not hurry, there is no one waiting for you. I finally got a clean shirt? Or do I have to endure and all stained? I'll give you another shirt. What a fate ?! And this is you. He has not changed much. It's my fault. It's always your fault, right? At that moment I realized .. ... That the most evil people in fact the most helpless. Both at home and at work, I like things to be the way I think is right. My wife did not dare to contradict what I say. We have all this happens: If Sudzha said that now a day, then now a day. Different opinions can be only where there is a point of view. What is the opinion of your wife may be about dissolute life? Good! I do not henpecked husband like you, to laugh. Do you drink scotch, which I brought back from duty free Dubai .. ... But I'm the same, and insult? Come on. From all of us brother Unni smartest. You collected debts at his own wedding! If they want something else to give, I'll be glad to take. I have yet to give his daughter in marriage. Our test was ingenious. All forced to guess who will get the same result in the house. The sons are useless. So the house is likely to depart one of the daughters. At Amma as the older, more rights. Moreover zyat—ëk from the Gulf, like me, as a bonus. The house can get and Sudzha. When shared property .. ... Sister Sudzha tried everything to be as it is convenient. My nature does not allow you to trade as others. Perhaps, therefore, to have so many responsibilities. The old man knew that you - the ILO. Our wives bite on the subject without end. So hold your hopes. Maybe we should finish this tape? That's right! When will we all get together like this? The wait is not long! At the funeral of an old woman. Oh no! Sister! Why are you asking me about this now? Tell me, please. Tell us! Rog, sister. My house is about Shivakasi. This state abroad, in the province of Tamil Nadu. It is very beautiful. Huge temples and large trees. It is far from here? Very far. I there are three monkeys, with whom I am on friendly terms. They eat everything! How did you come here? By car? On a cart pulled by an ox. And then on the bus. My uncle brought me here. He hates monkeys and always chasing them. And how much time you drove here? Long. I slept on the road. My poor friend, a monkey, probably crying. All think feeding them there if anyone. Shivakasi .. on the bus ... Hopelessly in love, .. ... You split with the one you love? Shivakasi, right? I was there 40 years ago. With his brother. That is your grandfather. And with the guy that owned a local store products. He is no more. His son ... bastard! What was his name? Vishnu! He now manages the shop. Useless fellow. Bring me a coin box with coins? One by one, all die. The one I stayed. In the meantime, my day has not come, .. ... I have to endure such suffering. Free me from these burdens quickly, Lord! No one understands my problems. They appreciate me only when I die. Grandpa? What? Grandpa, a little something for you I gave them the tadpoles and grandpa when they died. You're the next to die, right? Nonsense! Fried bananas so smell! Well, kids? As there del—ëzh property Kaustubame? You got anything? Because of this old house 3rd world war will begin. Who told you that I am from Shivakasi? Great-uncle. Who? Vasudevan Nair of Kaustubamov. This old man is still alive? He owes me ... about 55 rupees. He was going to bring them to you. Of course, when it's the day ?! What do children want? How to reach Shivakasi? Shivakasi? We went there many years ago. Go there in two buses with change. The seams? And there is a new bus to Shivakasi? There is a bus that goes to Madras via Shivakasi. It stops here. Uncle, how much is a bus ticket? I look like a conductor in your opinion? In any case, this is not a place to rest. Children there have to work hard to get something to eat. Understood? It is not for us, it's for Po ... He said that the bus goes to Madras. So we can ask the ticket price at Aunt Sheila. Cool idea! Children Take the girl with you, and I'll lock it. For example, in the jar. They played a game called "hide and seek" With red polka dots, with a fallen tree. You know, what is it? A Manikum? You do not know? Silly. Bring good luck red grains. Aunt Sheila, when you come to Madras? On the 16th day. And how will you go to Madras? By train. Not on the bus? Children can not long to go on the bus. Until the child was born, we went to the bus. Do you know how much is a bus ticket? I do not remember ... Back and forth, I think, about 70 rupees. Why do you ask? Are you going to go with me to Madras? For Manikum? We should share plans about Rog ... ... With Aunt Sheila? Why not ask her to pick up with Rogen in Madras? That sister Rog. Where's the kid? There. And what are you doing here? Come play with us. I have a lot of work. He will carry it. My aunt would scream at me. Come with me! I did not ask for money from the son-in Unni. Sweet little girl asleep. He knows the management of our bank. If he has recommended, we would get a loan for the business. And who will pay this loan? We'll find a way, my love. You mean that I have to find a way. All of these decorations - fake! We have nothing more to sell! Daddy's favorite girl woke up. You're mad at me, too, like your mom? I do not, my dear. Everything will be fine, dear. I even now there is no father, who would have to support. 70 crore. You know how it is? Thousand of candy and ice cream a full stomach, .. ... Hundreds of movie tickets and still remain. How many machines do you? Two or three. If you like you, one, perhaps. Do not even think about it! About what? Sell ‚Äã‚Äãthe car! It's just a toy car. Maybe, but it is amazing! How else do we collect so much money? I have an idea! 14 rupees! What? 14 crore? That's all you can get for it. Another 2 rupees. 16 crore. Foreign chocolate! Each can be sold for 5 rupees! Foolish children! Only 16. Money will not be more if you count them. What would you do if you had a lot of money? At first, I would have bought a ticket for Rogen. Then Superman comics. Then candy ice cream ... ... gum ... ... A lot of toys ... And then ... Many bring good luck red beans! Silly girl! None of their money can not buy! They are worth nothing! At great-uncle in the bank full of money Razbivayu? That's wrong, right? It's for a good cause. Splits faster. 13 rupees and 15 paise. 9 rupees and 60 paise, I think. It just seems this way to you? That's four times counting? This time for sure say! And some can not? There definitely 10 rupees. What is with the money for the chocolate? 39 rupees and 15 paise. How many more do you want? 30 rupees and 85 paise. What do we do now? Aunt Sheila said that it is necessary to 70 rupees, right? Yes. But it's there and back! Exactly! We have to send Rogen home, you must buy a one way ticket. What is half the price. And this is? 35 crore. We have them! Tremendous heat! Monsoon season does not occur. Electricity is turned off all the time. Sit. Two months ago we had no electricity in Dubai. A total of 5 minutes. Sheikh immediately ordered an investigation. It lasts for 6 months. What? The investigation! This only can happen in Dubai. 6 months to investigate what .. ... What happened two months ago. Rain, as politicians, have never come on schedule. In the 20th century, no normal electricity nor air-conditioning. The future of this country is hopeless! If everything is hopeless .. ... Why are some so greedily eager to get a house here? We are not greedy. Father wanted us to live here. Those who did not want to see, he was kicked out of the house. Some without shame or conscience still live in the neighborhood. Both of you can calm down? So you think I'm greedy? I did not submit to his father to the court for the home! Hello? What kind of country is this? No electricity, no running phone! That's why I do not like to live here. We should sit down a bit. Why are you calling him all the time? Soak pause a few days and he'll call you. Such muzhskaya psychology. Nothing like him does not work! Why are you brother Raghu always tuned to swear? You were a child. Remember Kumar? Another Raghu. Poet Kumar? He went crazy for me. I devoted many poems. It was all so romantic .. and so useless. When Hari made the proposal, all told, that he could get rich. Yes, he was educated and attractive. But I did not care. Someone has to take care of the future. All of them are envious of my life. I have never since seen Kumar. I heard his poems. They have become much better. And since then, Raghu despises me.
