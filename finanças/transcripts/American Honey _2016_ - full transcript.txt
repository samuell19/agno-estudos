Business is tough. I only take hard workers. Shut the fuck up. Yeah, I can work hard. - Yo, get in there. Hey. - Hey. What the fuck's going on? - We're getting in. - Get in the car.

Now you gotta turn and lick his collar grease. - Yo, it's Mary Jane. - Y'all got that? - Hey, what's up? Are you new? - Yeah. Yeah? You should let me be the first one to fuck you. Hold up, hold up. Don't worry, he wouldn't know where to fucking put it if you had it, 'cause you're still a virgin. Man, I ain't no damn rookie, and this is no damn toy. Corey pulled his dick out in front of the new girl! You got me in the ass! - Get him! - Get his ass! Get my shoe back. I'm sorry. My bad, y'all. Yo, my bad! We got his ass! Hey, you gotta learn to leave the new girls alone. Don't worry, new girl. We do that all the time when he does that. Stop looking so damn nervous.

Ow, shit... Fuck. Was I not doing it right? No, you gotta be gentle. Kal with the long blonde hair, he's from Missouri. He really don't talk much about himself. He's scared of flies, moths, birds, and damn near anything that flies. - Shut the fuck up. - It's fucking crazy, man. - Corey, tell her where you're from. - I'm Corey. I'm from Baltimore. - I'm Katness, and I'm from Miami. - She got mean pole-dancing skills. Katness is so beautiful, loving, caring... I don't even know what to say about that girl. So, I have this obsession with Darth Vader. To me, he's just like the epitome of just darkness and suffering. - Yeah. - Um, and misunderstanding. Um, I feel like he was just a broken heart that lost any hope for love and life. What about Jake? What about him? Where's he from? - He's from Bakersfield. - Let me tell you something. This man, when it comes to his job, he takes that shit serious, like. This dude can sell, like anything and everything. You give it to him, he'll sell it. - Jake is a power agent. - I don't know what the fuck he says. Maybe it's his personality, I'm thinking. He is Krystal's bitch, like super bad, and he has to drive her around everywhere. - She loves the ass... - Meow! - A puppy in heat. - Yeah, yeah. Hey, Billy, can we stop? I need to pee. Are we able to get us something to drink? Hey, can we just pull over and go randomly milk a cow? Hey, there's water right on the floor, man, right in front of you. I'm gonna piss in my seat if you don't stop. We'd better go through a fucking drive-through. Food, yeah. Is this of you selling? Yeah, we're at a Walmart selling some shit. - So this is what I have to do? - Yeah, sell magazines. You just gotta come up with your own spiels and shit, like I use the whole, "Oh, my dad was killed in Afghanistan" shit. Shit, was he? No, but, shit, people love that patriotic shit. - Kansas City, y'all! - Oh, shit. Kansas City. I never seen so many tall things in my life. This is where Superman lives. - That bitch is fucking huge. - Oh, hell, yeah, dude. - I wonder what those buildings are? - It's a city. I know, but I wonder what the bigger buildings are? Holy shit. Look at those fucking buildings. Kansas City, baby! - Hell, yeah. Kansas. - Wizard of Oz. Dorothy. I ain't never seen so damn many train tracks in my life. Is this where we're staying? Yeah, this looks like where we're staying. It's about damn time. It only took, like, fucking forever. Is this the fucking place? It looks like a fucking crack fucking motel. - Oh, fuck. - Fucking bird. Look at this fucking place. There's kids right there, watch your mouth. Pet the poochie. This is a sketchy-ass motel. It looks like you go up in there and get a good staph infection... I'm excited. Hey, look, Krystal's car. Yeah, that's Krystal's car. - That's what her and Jake came in. - Serious? - What the fuck, y'all? - Damn, dude! Chill the fuck out. Fuck, man. That's some bullshit. Get his fucking ass. The motherfucker can't drive, man. - Hey, hey, hey... - Oh, my God. Star, wait up a second. Maybe we need to roll one up. Hey, get your girl. This is your blanket. Who the fuck are you talking to? - What's up with you? - Hey. - Are you good? - Yeah. All right, so this is your welcome packet, yeah? So in there are the crew rules. You gotta memorize this shit by tomorrow morning. Basically, you just, like, memorize the first ten parts. It's quick. This is where all the magic happens. This is your pad case. So it's got everything you need in there. I got your stickers and shit, so you can decorate it however you want. - Stars. - Yeah. Stars for Star. So your contract's in there. You gotta get that signed by 7:30. You get it to Room 233 for Krystal. 7:30? And Krystal's, like, she's a bitch until she gets to know you, you know. But she's good people, you know? She is. It's just she doesn't know you, you know. You're new. So... Oh, and, um, I got you a present. You got me a present? You don't have to close your eyes or anything. You just gotta prove to me your real name is Star. You're funny. Prove to me your name is Star, and I'll give it to you. It was my mom's idea. She said we're all made from stars. From Death Stars. Can I get my present? I made that. You got girly handwriting. You're a Death Star? Scared? Bang. What the fuck? What's up, G? You can't be doing that shit. You came too close. - You came too close. - Stop. And now you're stuck. - And now you're stuck. - Stop. - And now you're stuck. - Jake, stop. Okay. "Be on time for all meetings, curfews and pick-ups. No males in female rooms. Dress for success. Don't tell anyone where you're staying. Uh, "Do not talk to motel guests. Be on time for all meetings, curfews and pick-ups. No males in female rooms. Dress for success. Do not tell anyone where you're... They're gonna send us to the spice mines of Kessell, and they'll fuck with us. They'll fuck with us. Hey, don't let her go on the road. Fuck... Goddamn world of Google. Fucking McDonald's poisonous shit. Fuck. Stay. You're late. I'm sorry. I... Shit. What's rule one? Don't be late for anything. Bitch, you don't make money, I don't make money. You get it? I'm gonna let it slide this time because it's your first day. You keep 20 percent of what you make, 25 if it's cash. - Always try and get cash. - Okay. The rest is management fees, goes to motels, gas. That's basically it. Jake'll train you. You like that idea? He's the best I got. He knows everything on how to make money. And what are we here for? To make money? Good. Hold on. Here's for food and things till you start earning. Thanks. I'll pay you back. Damn straight. This isn't no fucking charity. I'm gonna take it off your first paycheck. Okay. We have a crew meeting at 8:00 in the parking lot. Where'd it go? Point at it. Point at it. Let's fucking bounce. K.C., K.C.! That's right. What's up? She looks just like she wants to fight. Nah, I'm good. You see the stickers Jake got me? - Hey, that's pretty. - Yeah. He got me Princess Leia stickers when I first got here. He got you stickers, too? Mmm-hmm. Yeah, I used to have them on here, but the rain kind of washed them off. - Hey. Hey. - Hey, shut that off. All right. Okay, listen up. Where y'all headed today is real wealthy territory. I ain't tried this kind of territory before, but these people are loaded and it shouldn't be hard. - So what are there? - No excuses. And with Loser Night coming up in a few days, some of y'all need to step the fuck up. Step the fuck up. I said one, two, three, four, five. This loser ain't got no job. Six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Let's back it up and do it again. - Say I. - Hey-o! - Got money. - Got dough. I said shit, goddamn. Get off your ass and slam. 071, 071, 071! All right, get to work, you lazy fuckers. I'll tell you what. Ain't nobody coming to my fucking room to take a shit again. You and Runt can go to y'all room to take a shit. When I walked in the fucking bathroom, there was a fucking cow patty. That wasn't me. I fell asleep. And there was a little fucking Hershey kiss just floating in the toilet. I don't give a damn who takes a shit in my room as long as you flush it. Febreze, though. If somebody comes over to my place I ask them to use Febreze in my bathroom, so if you do take a shit, you better spray and you better flush. I don't know. Everybody knew my fucking toilet didn't work. Hey, Austin. What's Losers' Night? That's a fun motherfucking night right there. Yeah, kinda, sort of. It's a party practically. It's where the two losers of the week... - Whoever makes the least amount... - Least amount of money. ...has to fight each other. It's a game, but technically it's not a game. - 'Cause they're physically fighting. - It's like a tradition. They're putting their hands on each other. - Krystal kinda set that shit up. - Y'all are fucked up. - It's stupid shit. - It gives us something to do. When you're on the road most of your life, you need something to get some shit out. We gotta have something to occupy ourselves. Like every time he whips his dick out, we all jump on him? It's a game. We all have our little thing, you know. Like when the Rihanna song comes on, you know how, in Kmart, we all, like, dropped. Yeah, it's stupid shit. It's bullshit. We have fun. - It is tradition. - I never lose. You know what Darth Vader looks like inside his suit? No. What? He's a skeleton. Just like the rest of us. Look at the water fountain. The fucking water fountain. I was laying down, right, and I seen these little fucking shadows on the fucking ceiling dancing, dog. It's called acid, bro. Look at this fountain. Look at this fountain. Look at this fountain. Look at this fountain. - Holy shit. - That's big. - This is a nice-ass neighborhood. - Mission Hills. It's not like you just get a couple of magazines... - Give me your money, bitch! - You rich motherfuckers. These are, like, lawyers and shit. Yeah, we're all gonna do very well today. Yeah. Yeah. Let's go to that house first. Dude, that fucking place is sick. Oh, yeah, like, I was in Del Rio, Texas. I was hunting turkey with my stepdad. That motherfucker was, like, chasing me for, like, 20 minutes, like, pecking my ass while I was running and all that shit. Man, my stepdad had to shoot the motherfucker off me, like, straight up. - Look at that horse. - Shit, that's tight. - Yeah, yeah. - It's badass. Let me get your number. Let me get that number. That is. That's like a ten. That's like a ten. Yeah, it probably cost like a thousand. Damn, look at that house down there. The thing about it was, I wasn't even hunting turkey. I was hunting deer. I wasn't even trying to hunt the motherfucker. You'll see me with a skate park in the back, a skate park in the front. A skate park through the house. I don't give a fuck. - I'll be skating all day. - Fuck this place. - Yeah. - That's what I got to say. Hey. All right, I'm calling out teams now. We're going backwards from yesterday. QT and Austin is team one. Kat and Gay Ray's team two. Kal and Riley's three. Sean and Shaunte again, four. Pagan, Billy, five. - Corey, Runt, six. - Hell, yeah. Me and new girl. I need my pad case and my cigarettes and my phone. I'm ready for this. Let me get out of this car before I slap the bitch out of her. Good luck. Have fun. - You stay on your own side. - Yeah, faggot ass. - Hey, you guys got phones? - Hey, JJ. - Yeah, I got 'em. - Sell as many as you can, bro. - Bitch. - Dicks. So it's me and Star next, and then you're gonna take Pagan to the church, - and then we'll just all hook up there. - All right, cool, yeah. All right. How do I look, Death Star? Let's see. Hold up. - Like a smart-ass power agent. - You know what I'm saying? Fuck, yeah, like a power agent. Shut the fuck up. - Wanna see something crazy? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Pow. - That better not be real. - Dude, are you fucking kidding me? - You just put that shit in my face? You're fucking laughing. You just put a real-ass gun in my face? Yeah, but it wasn't chambered. It's not like... What do you need a gun for anyhow? I don't trust many people, you know? - What the fuck? - Let me see it. Come on, give it here. I got it. I just don't know how to... Asshole. What did you press? What did you press? You really put a fucking gun in my face, and you don't even know how to use it? I know how to use it. I didn't know how to press the release. There's nothing in it. Relax. You read the handbook last night - about the five sales steps? - Yeah. That's a bunch of shit, all that. You don't gotta listen to that. See, 'cause in Jake's book there's one fucking step. Not five, just one. It just takes one step. Once you get this one fucking step down, you're the chief of the tribe. And I'm gonna teach you that one step today. You hear what I'm saying? Basically, as soon as they open that door and look at you, that's the critical moment, that's the make-or-break moment. 'Cause in that second you gotta work them, you gotta read them, you gotta be able to scan them and figure them out, figure what kind of person that person wants in their life. Then you gotta be that person. You know? So, like, a couple of the other agents are really rigid about the five sales steps and all this shit. So they'll pick a spiel that's, like, some sad shit, like... "Mama's got cancer" or, "My fucking foot is falling off." "I'm trying to get my life back together." You know, "I got a little lost there in my teens, and now I'm really working on myself, man," and, "Oh, you know, my dad, he died in Iraq." Any sad spiel, and they'll just say it over and over and over again until it's meaningless. This person? This person doesn't give a fuck about magazines, right? They want something from me, so if I'm a G, I'm gonna figure out what that something is and I'm gonna work that. - Yeah? - And that's a power agent. All right. Let's go. You're my good-luck charm. Here we go. The thing you gotta remember is, every Jones is different. Mmm-hmm. Every sale, right? Mmm-hmm. You gotta treat it like it's a game. You know? - Hi. - Hi. No, we've never met. I'd remember a face like that. What's your name? - Destiny. - Destiny, I'm Jake. How are you? - Nice to meet you. - This is my younger sister, Star. - Uh, you want my mom? - No, but can you do me a favor? One favor. Can you feel this material? Just feel it. What does that material feel like to you? I don't know about that. You know what kind of material it is? - Uh-uh. - That's boyfriend material. You know what I'm saying? Look right here. - Who is it? - Genuine boyfriend... - Hi, there. - Can I help you folks? Hi, yeah, I was just explaining to your daughter, we're part of the Three Cs contest, which is a collegiate communications competition. So we've been going door-to-door, sort of garner support for our team. Walking all day. You think I can get a glass of water from you? - Where's your accent from? - I'm from Bakersfield, ma'am. - California. - Hmm. - Yeah. - You're a long way from home. Long way. But you gotta do what you gotta do, you know. Um, I'll get you guys a glass of water. - Thank you. - Hold fire, Destiny. Just you go join your friends. I'll deal with this. Uh, good day to walk, though. Really good day to walk. How long we walked now? Five, six miles? - Something like that. - A little dehydrated, ain't you? Six or seven miles in this is pretty good. It could be worse, you know? - Okay, you can come in. - Thank you. - Just for a moment. - Thank you so much. Excuse the mess. Destiny had a birthday sleepover. I'll just grab you something to drink, and then you can tell me about the contest. Okay. - This is a beautiful house. - Thank you. Yeah. Thanks so much for letting us in. We have just about everything. What would you like? I'll take a beer if you have it. - How about you? - I don't want anything. I thought you were on your last legs. Well, I'm not. Okay, well, look, I don't have much time, so if you wanna just tell me about the contest. Well, so basically I'm working on gaining points towards school. That's the ultimate dream, to study, you know? So if you just... Do you mind if I put this on the floor for a second? Oh, sure. So if you just pick two items off this list, that will go a huge way towards making my dreams a reality. - How does this get you to college? - It's an old-fashioned magazine drive. So for every subscription that you pick, I get points for. When I get to 100,000 points, I'm at like 88,000 now, I get a free year of school. So, you're selling magazines? Yeah, that's what he's doing. He's selling you magazines. I'm selling magazines, yeah, but I'm also selling myself, you know, belief in my future. Um... You know, they put us through a whole course for, like, five months where... I'm sorry. I just... I don't really read magazines anymore. Yeah, you could give the magazines to whoever you want. I mean, it's less about the magazines and more about sponsoring impoverished youths, so that they can chase their dreams and actually make something of their lives, you know. It'd be a belief in me, you know. I come from nothing, ma'am. Like I'm an impoverished youth, bottom barrel, and this would be my chance to, like, achieve something more with myself. - And what do you plan to study? - Politics. - Really? - Yeah. Why is that funny? - Oh, it's not. - No. - I was just... I was surprised. - It's a strange pick, you know. - It's a strange major. - Why? I'm sorry. She's my sister. I love her, but she's special, you know. I'm not your fucking sister, and I'm not special, all right? - Hey. - You can go fuck yourself. Hey. I don't allow language like that in my house. Well, I don't live here. You know, it's been really hard for us emotionally since my mother threw herself in front of a cow truck about four years ago. We've been trying to acclimate. - That's not even funny. - Hard to adjust emotionally. No, it's not funny. I'm just trying to give her some insight as to why you're acting out. Okay, I think it's time for you to go. I think if you gave me five more minutes, ma'am. I have been trying to be Christian, but I can see the devil has a hold of the two of you. I think the devil has a hold of your daughter. Destiny, turn off the music and put some clothes on! No! It's my birthday, and you said I could do what I like. Thank you so much for your time. - Happy birthday! - Turn it off! Hey! Hey, hey! Hey! What the fuck was that? - You went too far. - With what? With the whole mom and the cow truck thing. - You can't say shit like that. - I said it to you before we went in. I said it doesn't fucking matter. You say what you have to say.

Pam O'Neil, huh? - Yes. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Have any other students walked by your house - from Kansas State? - No. - None? - Not that I'm aware of. Okay, so we picked a good spot. So, basically, we're here with the NCA Communications Competition. We're 50 girls, 50 guys. Top five get to travel to Hawaii. Me, too, sir. We're coming from the United Methodist Baptist Church about 45 miles from here. We build a little bit of a traveling distance. Come here, Star. This is my sister. - Hi. Hi there. - Hello. How are you? Whole family's here, huh? How you doing? I'm Jake. I don't wanna take up too much of your time. I just wanted to come by, say hello, sorta give you an introduction as to who we are. We're coming from K State, we're doing a magazine drive, sort of gain some money for the new cafeteria we're trying to build. Yeah. I go to K State, and I haven't heard about this new cafeteria. Yeah, there's a new cafeteria they're building. They're trying do it altruistically as opposed to using like student funds. Oh! Trying to sorta see if we can get it from the community. It seems like you'd have to sell a lot to, you know, actually make enough to build a cafeteria. Well, here's the thing... Mmm. Now put your finger right here. Thanks for keeping it alive for me. - Where you from? - We're both from Kansas. - Where? - Uh, where are you from? - I'm sorry. I just... My... - That's okay. We just walked through a whole bunch of pollen coming across the street. - My eyes... - Kansas City. It's really pretty. - All the bridges. - Yeah, yeah. Kansas City. You know where Zeke's Barbecue is? So maybe about three blocks around Zeke's Barbecue by the coin laundry, there's an apartment building there called The Magnolia. - Yeah, I'm not familiar with it. - It's a really nice area. - I love barbecue. - I do, too. - Yeah. Does your husband love barbecue? - Mmm-hmm. You're not gonna believe this, but there's an outdoor frontiersman magazine that basically is all about paleo diets and outdoor eating, which is a really nice pick, um, if you have any interest in that. Ooh, I got this one now. Watch this. Don't say anything. Okay. # We gotta keep on dreaming # We gotta keep on dreaming # Dream on, dream, baby, dream # We gotta keep our hearts open # We gotta keep our hearts open # We gotta keep our hearts open # Dream on, dream, baby, dream You like that, huh? # We gotta keep our hearts open - Is she okay? - What's that? - Is she okay? - Oh, yeah. You just gotta keep her in your prayers, darling. We're coming from the Covenant House. We're trying to help... - What's the matter with her? - ...homeless children. You got five seconds of your time to spare? Oh, I really don't have time right now. Not even five seconds for homeless kids, huh? - I am so sorry. - You sure? I'm so sorry. Not right now.

You know Jake's one of my top sellers, right? Yeah. So how come in the past couple of days he made less than he ever made in the past year? He's training me. Jake's trained almost everybody on crew. That ain't stopped him making money before. So I wanna know why. I don't agree with the way he does things. You don't like the way he does things? Jake. - Mmm. - The fuck you doing? - Start with my legs. - Yep. So, tell me, what was it that you don't agree with that Jake does? The lying. He ain't lying. He's selling. That's his job. I don't get what you want. You wanna make money or you don't? - I wanna make money. - What? - I wanna make money. - She just needs more time. I'm good with the wild ones, you know? I'm not a fucking cow. It costs me when you don't earn. Do you get that? This shit, the motel, the gas, everything, that costs me. And I can't run my business like that. So you show me you can do it, or I'll leave you on the side of the road. Clear? Crystal. Is that a joke? No. That's it. We have business to take care of. Turn around. - Somebody opened their door... - Is this Nebraska? ...trying to let their dog use the bathroom. And I seen this bitch, I was like, "Damn, she's a badass bitch. I gotta have her." So this nigga right here... Ran up and snatched this bitch. - Now she's ours. - She's our dog now. Nobody's ever gonna get her back 'cause she's gonna be the new dog-food dog. - Hell, yeah. It's our dog now. - Or I'd kill you. Hey, do you think I can borrow your phone real quick? Yeah. I just got one quick call to make. Thanks. Make yourself useful. Hold this.

You're a long way from home, huh? Yeah, I do selling. Door-to-door. Door-to-door selling? What you selling? Nothing anyone ever wants to buy. Try us. Magazines. What kind of magazines?

All right. - You've got a pool? - Yep. Towels are right in there in the cupboard. - You want another beer, honey? - Have you got something stronger? Well, I think I might have some mescal. - What's that? - Mescal! That's... That's some kind of a spooky, powerful drink. That's... That's kind of a hard liquor. Women can't normally handle that. Give me some of that, then. You want some of that, dear? Is that what you want? - Well, all right then. - I don't know. It's not like normal liquor, you know. It's got some other kind of power to it. Sends you to kind of an ecstatic place. Come here. Like... Like ecstasy. Love drug. Yeah, I drank a little too much of this... I got you. Some kind of hoodoo-doo-doo. You drink enough of that, you'll bark like a dog and howl at the moon. Mescal. I would like some of this. You wanna go for a swim? I don't know how to swim. Well, you don't really have to swim.

Oh, yeah. - I like a girl with spunk. - Easy. - There you go. - Yee-hah! That's a hoodoo drink. I told you, women shouldn't drink that. That's bad for women to drink. - Fuck it. - Hey, hey!

That's a worm. - A worm? - Yeah, you're supposed to eat it when the bottle's empty. Oh, gross. Well, it's supposed to bring you love. And luck. Wait. Is it dead? Either that or it's real, real drunk. That's so gross. Yeah, people like that worm. Some people says they have magical properties. You eat that worm, you'll go on a trip and not even leave. Oh, no. Mercy. Oh! Magical. That'll wake you up in the morning. No. Put you to sleep. I think that's enough. Careful. I told you now, that's a very powerful kind of a substance there to be fooling around with. You're fascinated with that worm, aren't you? You thinking you might wanna eat that worm? No, she ain't woman enough to eat that. Put the bottle away. - It's not for women. - No. And especially not for little girls. Well, then, let me eat the worm. - Let you eat the worm? - I got this. You wanna eat that worm?

When I was younger, like when I was eight or something... - Mmm-hmm. - ...nine, eight, nine, my dad used to drop me off at his old man's house in Bear Valley. It's Tehachapi, it's like the hills of Bakersfield, and they got all these woods up there. And he used to just let me free, just let me roam, you know. He taught me that wolf noise in case I ever got lost or got into shit, you know, I'd just do the noise. How could he tell if it was you or a real wolf? 'Cause there's no real wolves up there. - So you were the only wolf. - Mmm-hmm. Losers' Night. Come on. Let me get the money. - My sales? - Just give it to me. Krystal's gonna be pissed 'cause we missed the pick-up. So I just need something to grease the wheels, like a peace offering. But I did the sale. It's my money. I've got it. - No. We did the sales. - No, I did the sale. Can we not argue? Can you just give it to me? Do you wanna be on the mag crew? You gotta listen to me. Just give it to me. We missed the pick-up. We gotta do something. Just give it to me. Please? Can I have the slips, too? You don't have to give me attitude. You gotta listen to me. Just listen to me. Don't fight me right now. And this relationship thing with me and you? It's not happening, you know. What do you mean? I mean, we just can't talk about it 'cause it's, um... She's got this thing. She says, you know, love is bad for business. So there's no relationships in the mag crew. It's just her thing. Just go with it. - But what about you and her? - Just go with it.

Yeah. You think they're gonna miss any of this stuff? - Who? - The people. I don't know. How is this your dream, though? Well, that's not the dream, but that buys the dream. I just wanna get, like, my own spot somewhere in the woods and just fucking... Just stay small, you know. Like a little duplex or something. Like the 40 acres and a mule, you know? Just some piece of land in the woods somewhere. Someday. This is a lot, though. It's gonna be enough. Not quite. I need a couple more thousand probably. Did you hear that? This is so fucking crazy. Whoa. See? You're not the only wolf. - Fucking pizza. - Fuck you, pizza. Where's that pepperoni? - What up, Krystal? - What up, QT? What's happening? What's up? - I got presents and I got you pizza. - You got some presents? Okay. Okay, so this town has got people from all over the country and it's filled with fucking oil. - So what does that mean? - Money. # Money, money, money It means these people are making a shit load of money. And how does that make people feel when - they make that kind of cash? - Amazing! - Makes me wanna cream my jeans. - No, it makes them feel like shit. - Yeah. - It makes them feel guilty. So I want y'all to dress like dirty white trash, and then they'll pity you. - Dirty white trash. - Like we're not trashy enough. Can I be clean white trash? Oh, no, that's the boys' bag. Pagan. - It's a shirt. - No, that's a dress. That's what you wear. That's for Shaunte. Star. That's a dress. Yeah, you don't wear underwear with that too. So the men here work 17 hours a day, so there are some lonely ladies here. So I'm gonna drop all the boys off here. - Jake. - Yeah. Billy, y'all get out here. Make that money, honey. Look at that mama with her baby. Kalium, there's a bee. There's a bee. Put some fucking shoes on. Put some damn shoes on. Hey, why are you dressed like that? - You dressed me like this. - No, I didn't. Yes, you did. Y'all are gonna make hella money today. I'm taking you out to the oil fields. These guys make like a hundred grand a year. Shit got real. They're away from home, - there's no ladies... - Ooh! Butter 'em up, baby. Butter 'em up! - It's gonna pump you up. - It's gonna pump me up? I love getting pumped up. So get 'em before they get off to work. Let's do that shit. Long day selling magazines, huh, Bella? Check out this song I got for you. Hey! Check it. Let's go. Let's pump it up! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! # Yellow diamonds in the light # Now we're standing side by side # As your shadow crosses mine # What it takes to come alive # It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny # But I've gotta let it go # We found love in a hopeless place # We found love in a hopeless place # Yeah, QT. Hey, hey, hey, hey! Whoo-hoo! Oh, yeah! - Thank you. - Whoo! Whoo! Shake it! What's up, ladies? You girls prostitutes or what? The fuck? Do we look like prostitutes? - I mean, kinda, yeah.

I respect that. Good luck, sales associates. Can I get you to go for me? It's okay. All right. How about, er... I gotta go to work. How about you give me your phone number? - Go get some drinks? - How about a kiss? A kiss? Already? Damn. You called me a prostitute. - Do you like prostitutes? - I love prostitutes. Well, put your sunglasses on top of your head. - Not right now. - Are you sure? Yeah, I'm all right. I gotta get to work. Thank you. - It's free. - I know it is. All right, then. - Come on, let's go. - Ask for five minutes. You're not gonna find many good guys here. I didn't say I was looking for men. - Hey, wait! - Whoa. Wait. I wanna see the oil field. Do you think I could ride with y'all? - What do y'all think? - Yeah. Climb up in. Thanks. Y'all are good. Star! Wait! What the fuck? Where you going? So you're all rich? - Yeah. - Yeah, we're filthy rich. Hell, everyone working the oil field's rich. If you're all so damn filthy rich, y'all can buy some of my magazines. So you hopped in the bed of this truck to sell us fucking magazines? - Basically. - What kind of bullshit is that? - You make money selling that shit? - I got a shit-ton of titles.

Get on in. I brought some wine for you. I figured all girls like wine. Yeah, thanks. Cheers. - So where are we going? - It's a surprise. I think you'll really like it. Especially for you. This is a good deal, isn't it? There are a lot of guys that would get you drunk and take advantage of you anyways. Yeah. Can you play with me a little bit? This is a nice truck. What's funny? You're sitting there talking about my truck while you're stroking my cock. Well, it's a nice truck. Yeah. Kinda turns me on. Am I doing this right? Can I ask you to do me a favor? - Since I am paying for this. - Okay. Could you be quiet? Okay, I'll shut up. How long do you think you need? For fuck's sake. Can we try something else? Can you take your panties off? Turn and face me. Open your legs. More. You can pull over right here. Thanks. Don't I get a kiss good night? - What the fuck are you doing? - 071, motherfucker.

A hundred dollars every time he finds a girl. Where you think Drema came from? And he fucks all of them, too. Y'all don't mean nothing to him. I've been trying to think if I should keep you or not. Did you make any money in Williston? Yeah, I did, but I ain't got the slips for you. That's cool. Just give me the money and give me the slips later. Did you think that was Jake? That's Bill. - Bill, that's Star. - Hey, Star. And that's Frank. Jake's gone. I told him he can't come back again. Anyways... Hey, so this is all... Hey! - Krystal's fucking talking. - Yo, everybody.

I would not wanna have dreads right now. I couldn't even fucking sell. It's too hot. - Like this. - How much'd you make? I didn't make shit. You didn't make nothing? - Take me from behind. - Get away! I'm like, "Where do you think you're going, bitch?" She's like, "Yeah! Yeah!" Jake's in the van. Where the fuck you been? Yeah, where the fuck you been, bro? - Hey, let's go. - Running off like that. Yeah. # She grew up # On the side of the road # Where the church bells ring and strong love grows # She grew up good, she grew up slow # Like American honey # Steady as a preacher, free as a weed # Couldn't wait to get going # But wasn't quite ready to leave # So innocent, pure and sweet # American honey # There's a wild, wild whisper blowin' in the wind # Callin' out my name like a long-lost friend # Oh, I miss those days as the years go by # Oh, nothin' sweeter than summertime # And American honey # Get caught in the race of this crazy life # Tryin' to be everything can make you lose your mind # I just wanna go back in time # To American honey # There's a wild, wild whisper blowin' in the wind # Callin' out my name like a long-lost friend # Oh, I miss those days as the years go by # Oh, nothing sweeter than summertime # And American honey # Gone for so long now # I gotta get back to her somehow # And American honey # And American honey # Hey, Krystal, where's the music? Let's go. Let's go. Whoo! I singed my goddamn eyebrows, bro.
