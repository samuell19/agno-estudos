Good Evening and welcome to the show that dares to lift the veil on the unknown to confront our darkest fears. Are you ready to spend the night, with Spencer Knights? My team on tonight's vexing vigil are... Kev on roving camera. And returning to the show after a three-year sabbatical, we have camerawoman extraordinaire, Jo. Hi. And facing her nocturnal nightmares, tonight's celebrity fear-facer, star of Dream Angels, Martha Clewes. It's Marva, with a V. Tonight, through the power of mind control technique, I will give our guest the will to face her deepest fear. Fear, of the dark. But unknown to Miss Clewes, we're not taking her just any dark place. We're taking her to one of Britain's most haunted locations. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Baylock's Folly. So remember folks, don't lose your cool. And be Mind-Full. Is that the best you can do? It's gonna be a long night. Where is everyone? I don't know. We're supposed to meet the caretaker. I see you've got your coverage sorted. Kudos. You ain't seen nothing yet. Someone's left us a tipple. Oh hi, Clem. Jesus! Apologies. Must have nodded off. I sleep like the dead. Clem is the keeper of this isolated outpost. She's held the position for, quite a while so she knows a thing or two about it's unsettling history. Oh. For your troubles. Much appreciated. I'll put it away for a special occasion. Yeah, like breakfast. Over the years, there has been a plethora of phantom phenomena in the lower levels of this building. What isn't said, is the foundation of this folly contain the remnants of a 15th century plague hospital. No they don't. The bubonic plague, or black death was one of the worst diseases in history. Half of Europe's population was wiped out by it. A plague doctor who worked here, William Baylock, took it upon himself to ease the suffering of those in his care. It is said Baylock succumbed to the disease himself, losing his mind in the process. No, no he didn't. Let's descend and see what lies in the bowels of this dark folly. Kev, that's her head! Sorry. Jesus! It is said this diseased doctor still wanders the tunnels beyond this door, endlessly searching for victims to dispatch from their despair. But if his spirit comes across the living, well, it's a case of bring out your dead. Tonight, we will be completely cut off from the outside world to investigate the mysterious manifestations in this tunnel of terror. The guys back at the hub will put reverb on that. Awesome. You okay? Yeah I'm fine, just not big on enclosed spaces. Good job you're not spending the night in an underground tunnel then. What's that smell? Is that vinegar? That's not vinegar, it's rat's piss. Or, it could be all the rotting dead bodies down here. Kevin! Spooky. The beaked masks of plague doctors contained oils and herbs to filer what they thought was infected air. Maybe I should get one. Kev, here. Bizarrely, these guys would soak their garments in vinegar and rose water to keep the Black Death at bay. The wooden cane was carried to inspect patients. Legend has it, Baylock used this not only to examine the infected, but ultimately to choke them to death. There have been many reports of stick-like tapping echoing through these tunnels, often followed by the muted screams of Baylock's victims. Some have even felt the sensation of something wooden, slowly choking them. I'm used to that feeling. It's probably just rats. Yeah, rats with rhythm. Bloody hell Spence, when was the last time you got these things serviced? Just keep documenting! Shit! We can't leave her like this for much longer. Nice work with the vinegar. What vinegar? Darkness sees all. It stares at the fear hiding in your soul. when you hear the word, you can and you will face the darkest fear of all. Angels. Where am I? Jo? I't okay Marva, I'm here. Where's here? Miss Clewes, you're in the haunted remains of a 15th century plague hospital, 60 feet below a remote tower, deep in the English countryside. Oh, and it's almost midnight. I'm being filmed? Jo! Ah! Miss Clewes. Miss Clewes? How do you feel? Um, I'm quite good actually. Now that's the magic I'm talking about. Some say this is the face of one of Baylock's victims. If you look closely, it's screaming out in terror. Is this part of the therapy? Yeah, ruining it. Looks like a yawning camel to me. Kev, that does not look like a camel. Or an alpaca? What the hell's an alpaca? It's a sort of llama. What like the Dalai Lama? No, that's Lama with one L. Alpacas are smaller than llamas, and they've actually got a much thicker coat which is used in... What the fuck? The face is said to be that of a child. He killed children? To Baylock, all souls were equal in the need for redemption. Which is another way of saying, he was completely insane. How many people did Baylock kill? Oh, hundreds. It's said he finished off whole families. Must have seen it as his calling or something. Hundreds is probably pushing it a bit don't you think? I preferred you when you were comatose. Charming, nice to know you live up to your reputation, Spencer. What reputation? AHHH! Jo, are you okay? Have you been lurking in there all this time? Is this...? Yes it is, what's he doing here, Spencer? Who'd you think's been chucking these cameras and lights about the place? Nice to know we've go our very own techno-monkey on call. Nice to be appreciated. Took me all afternoon to install these puppies. Oh, and I don't suppose you've been tapping any walls tonight either? Whatever makes you say that? Thanks Xan, for adding a touch of drama to tonight's proceedings. But just remember in cyberspace everyone can hear you scream. That was bloody awful. It's my script honey, just stick with it, yeah? Not if you keep churning bollocks like that out I won't. Remind me why I asked you back again? Uh, because I make you look good? Fair enough. It's chilly. Oh, right. Aw... Oh. Thanks. Hands. William Baylock. Show us your presence. William, please give us a demonstration of your power. The darkness, whispers.... Silently giving release to God's children. No! The children! Suffering, all of them screaming, help, please help us! It's coming! Oh my god! Don't take stock of the tittle tattle about this place having once been a plague hospital. That was on the edge of town. This place has a different story to tell. In truth, children were moved here to be kept safe. Isolated from the black death. In these tunnels, under what was the old monastery. Baylock did see it upon himself to rid the town of the curse by dispatching the diseased. But not because he was infected himself. One night a fire broke out in the town. Everyone rushed to help, including the monks. But unknown to them, Baylock made his way down here. When the brothers returned, they found him surrounded by the lifeless bodies of 13 children, all with their windpipes crushed. He was said to be in the process of an incantation to invoke the spirits of darkness. You see, Baylock was what many people today would call a Satanist. He sacrificed victims as an offering, to gain his own soul passage to a darker dimension. But whatever the good fathers did to him that night thwarted his plan. Soon after the monastery was burned to the ground. The Folly was built in it's place, leaving the souls of Baylock and his young victims trapped eternally beneath it. Some say Baylock's remains are here still. And hundreds of years after his death, he walks these catacombs in endless search of them. Just thought I'd put you straight. On the reality of the situation. Remember. There is more in the darkness than you know. Good night. Now that was scary. That's it, I've got to get out of here! Marva, deep breaths, they're just stories. I don't care! I-I can't breathe, I'm suffocating! I can't get any air! Shh, Marva keep it together! We can get through this if we just stay calm. No, I can't deal with this! Dream. Your friend's great, a real screamer. One a.m., and the Mind-Full team split into two separate vigils. Intrepid newcomer Marva and myself in the first chamber, Jo and Xan at the far end. Kev will act as roving camera. But remember, whatever happens, don't give up the ghost. You're probably right, but I'm just saying the guy's moral compass is completely fucked. Shit, I can't believe I left Marva with him. I should be with her. Just relax. Spencer's many things but at least he's got the you know, touch, to keep her zoned out. Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of. Oh, please don't stop on my account. I'm just here to document. Don't kid yourself Kev. This craps' about as far away from a documentary as you can get. It's okay Kev, trash peddlers like us can only marvel in the presence of a real filmmaker like Jo. What films have you made again? Nothing that would register with your I.Q. That famous friend of yours does. Marva Clewes. I've still got one of her Dream Angels calenders. Actually I've got three years worth of them. December was always pretty hot. Why are you here, Xan? I was curious, to see how you were doing after your film course. I wondered if you'd learnt to grow up yet. Hey guys, remember it's Dark Vision, not Jerry Springer in a basement. Nice. Now we know where to dump Spencer after I kill him. That's a bit harsh. Don't tell me you've fallen for his gold-plated spin as well, Kev. Actually I have quite a lot of respect for him. That's funny, so did I. Playing with yourself again, Xan? It's the latest paranormal pocket product. A ghost hunting app, awesome! You seriously think this thing's for real? It's got a mode for measuring fluctuations in room temperature. Ooo, wow. It seems to have found a cold spot. And my own personal favorite, ASA. The ambient spectral analyzer. Which is? The detection of sound beyond the mortal range of hearing. Voices from the astral plane. Sun... Kitten... Cabbage... Car... Rainbow... And two million people stop downloading. It's okay. God Marva, you're freezing! What happened? I'm not sure, but I was deep in a contact trance when Martini just lost it. It's Marva! I felt some pushing against my throat. It felt like w-w-wood. Hey babe, that's just your imagination. Awesome. My arms, my arms! What's on my arms?! Somebody stop her! Keep filming. Marva, you're having a panic attack. No, I can see it! Disease, I've got the plague! Marva, keep, keep taking breaths. Nice and slow. That's it. That's it. She's in no state to continue with this. No shit. She'll be fine. Let's just get her some air, and we'll cont... No, Xan's right, she can't go on. It's okay. I just, I just needed to breathe. No. My necklace. Oh, you're shitting me. Must be around here somewhere. You're freaking out, about a piece of jewelry? It's special to me. I'll help you look for it Jo. Hey, Kev will help you find it. Okay. Uh, where do you think you're going? I'm taking her home. We've another four hours to get through yet. What? Look, I'll take her upstairs. I need to check on the streaming anyway. No, I'll take her. I'm taking her home. Well then, both of your fees for the evening will just have to stay in my bank account, unless someone can take her place. You manipulative little sh... It's ok, Jo. I'll go with Xan. But... We need this, hun. Okay. See you later, yeah? So that's what you learnt at film school. To help avoid cold spots. Bet that pushes your hits up. It pushes something up. Please, tell me you got that. Why was Jo so freaked out about losing a necklace? Um, maybe because it has sentimental value. It was just a cheap piece of old tat. Oh right. No. It belonged to her sister, Corinne. Jo doesn't have a sister. Didn't Jo tell you? Tell me what? They were out for a drive, when Jo stopped and got out to chat to a friend. While they were talking a drunk driver crashed into the car. Both cars caught fire. Corinne was trapped. When was this? Six years ago. Why didn't she tell me? Obviously you were good enough to tell. I was the one Jo stopped to talk to. I think I need some of Clem's little helper. So how long have you two, you know? We've been together for almost two years now. Wow, two years? That's... Longer than you had? I was gonna say quite a while. I had no idea Jo was, ya know? From what I hear, you were too busy checking out other girls to notice. Clearly I wasn't the only one. Besides, I wouldn't believe everything you hear. There are two sides to every story. Ain't that the truth. Hope you're refreshed and ready for round two, Miss Clewes, I know you're in there. I'm not going back down there. It's okay, I'll tell him you're not ready. I'll huff and I'll puff! I'm not doing it! Marva! Ah, Miss Clewes. I'm not doing it! What have you done to her? Carry on streaming, Xan. I thought Marva wasn't coming back. With the hits that we've been getting? The hub said that two teams have already been voted off. that leaves us and just two more to boot. You're not doing this. Jo, will you just get with the program and start taking this thing seriously? What? My girlfriend's having a major meltdown, and will probably never speak to me again for getting her into this bullshit. And I'm the one not taking things seriously! She'll be fine. In the meantime, we're down to the last three teams. We've almost got our own series. This is a big deal, Jo, we need to win this. Okay, I need to win this. If this goes tits up my next stop's the shopping channel. It's always about you. You'll do anything to bolster that over-inflated ego of yours, no matter who gets hurt along the way. Don't get superior on me. I know why you were fired from your last documentary. I wasn't fired, I quit. I, I need you, Jo. Look at what I've got to work with here, an app-obsessed nerd, and a cameraman who'd more used to delivering pizza than getting a shot in focus. No offense, Kev. Awesome. We're the same, Jo. Passionate, hungry. And we'll do whatever it takes to get it in the can. I did that on my last job. I may not be perfect, Spencer, but I do have some standards left. I just took a wrong turn before I found them again. That's okay! I understand. At the end of the day you've got to follow your heart. Even if that does mean hooking up with an ex soap star to get back on top. I'll pass that on to Marva when we get home. Great, you tell... Marva! Have you got a trigger word for everyone? Take her. What's mine? Awesome! Hic en spiritum. Sed non icorpore. Evokare lemures de mortuis. Decretum espugnare. De angelus Hakkai. En inferno inremeablis. WA TA NA SY YAM WA TA NA SY YAM WA TA NA SY YAM What are you doing, Spence? Just a bit of theater, Kevin. Jingle bells. I'm okay with that Spence, it's just, ya know, leaving Jo by herself. Believe me, she can handle it. Look, if we just give this thing one final take, we'll hit big, Kev! Okay. What do you want me to do? Well, start by chucking a few stones, then tapping the walls a bit, before really scaring them shitless. How am I gonna do that? There's a camera installed in the beak. Awesome. Contact me if Jo gets out of hand. Back at dawn. Sleeps like the dead. Great. The things I do for this show. Why can't I get this close to them when they're conscious? Spencer? Spencer! Spencer is that you? What the fuck? Marva. It's okay. But, Jo. Shhh. If that's you Spence, I swear to God I'll rip your fucking nuts off. Spencer! Open the door! The very walls of this building are transmitting the evil beneath. I've never experienced such a case of spectral banging in my life. I'm in awe, at the bravery of the team in the tunnels below. I hope they're alright. Clem, Clem! Kev, hello? Kevin. Hello? Jesus! I heard knocking. Shit! You look like you've seen a ghost, Mr. Knights! Here. Are you okay? I've been better. Tell me Clem, this devil worship thing. How can you be sure? I don't quite understand your meaning, Mr. Knights. I mean, Baylock. Was he really trying to open a doorway? Isn't what you've learnt this evening dark enough? Fairly. I was just curious. As I said, Baylock's victims were an offering, to gain passage to the shadow realms. Thankfully he was stopped before he could complete the incantation, thank the gods. Hence, his spirit is in purgatory. Trapped between this world and the ones beneath. Is that right? Well I think he just popped up to say hello. His shade may appear from time to time. In fact I've seen it myself on several occasions, most alarming. But I assure you Mr. Knights, it can cause no harm to the living. How do you know so much about this stuff? A PhD in witchcraft and the occult? One should never judge a book by it's cover Mr. Knights. Believe me, never before has one place been so plagued by the presence of evil. But so long as the ground below us remains hallowed, Baylock's spirit will remain safely trapped. Yeah, about that. I think there might be a little problem with the hallowed bit. Jo? Jo is that you? Spencer? I don't know what you're playing at, Spencer, but if you don't get me out of here right now my agent's gonna... I don't have an agent anymore. Marva? Alone. Here. You've got to be kidding me. Trapped. Evil. Help. Please. Please. Please. What did he do to you? Trapped. Evil. Help. Help, somebody please! Help me!! This kind of witchcraft is beyond the understanding of all but the most omniscient. Who taught you the incantation? Um, I was contacted by someone at the hub, I think. They sent me a text, along with illustrations. Oh God. I've forgotten. I don't know who it was! You have been manipulated, Mr. Knights. But that's impossible. I do the manipulating! Indeed. No! How can I have been so blind?! What? Tonight is the eve of Mabon, the Autumn Equinox. On the occult calender of old, it signifies a time when the barriers between this world and the ones beneath are at their most thin. What are you saying? I believe what has taken place tonight is a conjunction of factors adding to the master plan of, whatever is behind this. But, isn't it all just words? Just words? Maybe. But human sacrifices were also required. To seal the deal, so to speak. And if that is what has occurred tonight, then... What have I done, Clem? It appears you've opened a doorway. To Hell. That's one name for it. Whatever it's called Mr. Knights, there could now be an evil far more powerful than the spirit of William Baylock walking beneath us. Please, no. Believe me, Mr. Knights. The shadows are out there. Foul hordelings of demonkind. Is that what we're dealing with? Possibly. Though the incantation you read points to something more specific. A cambion. The name cambion was given in the post-medieval period to anyone thought to be the semi-human offspring of a demon. The energy of a developing fetus is extremely powerful. An ideal source for the demon to feed off. In fact, the young in general, hence the high possession rates among them. But what we're dealing with here is quite the opposite. This is the possession of someone who is already dead. Even centuries after death, Baylock's energy remains intensely powerful. I believe it is magnetic to the cambion. By joining with Baylock's spirit, a hybrid may be formed. Part phantom, part demon. That sounds like a pretty twisted mash-up. Yes, quite. And my theory is correct, the more souls this particular cambion takes, the stronger it will become. You mean, the more alive? If it's absorbing the life force of the living, it could enter the physical world, Mr. Knights. Our world. I'm responsible for unleashing this evil. What must I do, Clem? To recall the cambion back to the depths, you must invoke the spirits of light. But I can't do this by myself. I beg you Clem, please help me to stop this! I can't do it alone, I just can't face it! Man up! Fear feeds fear. Now. Let's go down there and send this evil fucker back to the dimension from where it came. Stand back. What the hell happened to you? I took the elevator. Obviously I've missed a few things. You can tell me how you did this when we get out of here. In the meantime, I want you to meet someone. Baylock. They crucified him. Yeah, that's not all they did. Oh god. Marva. No. Evil. Evil. Run. Run. Run. Run. Run. It won't open! I'm sure I've got the right key. The forces of evil are mocking us, Mr. Knights. We have reached the point where humankind ends, and the beast begins. We must fight fire with fire. What does that mean? Terra, ignis, aqua, elements of astral power I summon thee, earth by divinity, divinity by earth. Clem? Grant me the power to see, the strength of my enemies by my side. By the dragon's light, on this night, call to thee to give me your might. By the power of three, I summon thee, to protect all that surrounds me. So mote it be, so mote it be, so mote it be. I'm thinking this leads to a way out. Last time I passed through. We need to move, now! My leg's not up to that. Wait here. Xan! I'll be right back. I'll get you away from here. I'll get you away from him. Help. Help. Evil. Jo! Please. Help. Evil. Evil. Help. Free. Kev? Oh, Kev. Xan! Xan, let's go! Help. Please. Help. Just go! Come on! Help. Please. Baylock. Demon. Come on, let's go! Baylock. Fuck. Kevin, you scared the crap out of me. Where's Jo? Look, we need to get out of here and I'm not screwing around, Kev. Jesus. Back, demon! I seek out against you, cambion. I break your bond. May warlocks bewitch you, I break your bond. May Kurgarras bewitch you, I break your bond. May Narsindus bewitch you, I break your bond. May Agulgillu bewitch you, I break your bond! Go back deceiving figure, go back! Mr. Knights? Mr. Knights! The ground, is it hallowed? The evil is banished. We did it, Mr. Knights. We f-finished? Yes, Mr. Knights, you have completed your show. You okay? Yeah. Let's go. Alive. Alive. Alive! Alive! Alive! Alive!! ALIVE! * Old Soul by Louise Latham You're back in the room.
