Let's take another chance. - It's a waste of time. And we're ushers at a wedding. If we're late, it will throw out the whole works. Who gives a hoot? Stop at the drug-store. I'll call the club. Try his office. I've been trying that office for 3 days. - Do it anyway. Chapman, McBurn and Durant. No, sir. He hasn't shown up yet. Tell me. How are the old gentlemen taking it? Well, not so good. Mr Chapman caught him on the phone two days ago and talked pretty straight. Yes, I know. But don't they know what the trouble is? Well, you know how they are. And this is sort of a climax. He missed out on a couple of important cases last week. Wouldn't you think they'd be just a little sympathetic. Well, I would. College Club. He isn't in at present. Oh yes, Mr Brown. Why, he came in yesterday afternoon. We got him to his room and put him to bed, but he went out again last night. Yes .. yes, in rather bad shape. Well, that's that. The first thing Valentine will say is: "how is dear old Geoffrey"? Tell the little hypocrite he's swell. - Yeah. Busy in court on a big case. Say, drunk. I hope you will forgive my awkwardness. Why, sure. Say, did you notice .. - Shut up. I want to hear what they're saying in there. There are two people in there making important promises to each other. And trying not to laugh. Shut up. Valentine. Do you take this social register parasite to be your legal wedded toy? To hate, dishonour and ignore. Since it brings material advantages. Both social and financial. To supervise an annoying innate fineness with which I have been afflicted. I do. I do. I do. Then I pronounce you man and wife. And a cock-eyed credit to the country. Shut up! Why, that is Geoffrey Sherwood. The one that she threw over. - Yeah? He looks like he might start something. And take our love together to some sky .. Because I have anybody tell the angels. You'd better tell Murphy to pick him up. Where did he go? Bellevue for that one. I say, Mr Sherwood. Hmm? There is a plain-clothes man after you. What for? - Well, you look kind of excited. I'm not excited. I'm merely curious. There is going to be a merry spectacle coming out of that door in a minute. They'll take you to Bellevue. Am I being conspicuous? - Well, slightly. You'd better skid around that corner. Well, why not? - No, go along by yourself. Ditched again, eh? Well, come on then. You will forgive me but the impulse has evaporated. You need a drink. Do you know, I believe I do. - I know a spot. Up the center aisle together, eh? Okay, up the aisle. Boom de boom .. Congratulations. - Tony, thank you. It's been a beautiful service. - Yes, hasn't it. Lovely. How is poor dear Geoffrey? Busy as a bird-dog. He's in court this morning. The biggest case he's ever had. - Oh. Oh, I am glad. Best wishes, John. - Good luck, John. Thank you very much. - Goodbye. Boom de boom. Boom de boom. Boom de boom. Haven't you "boomed" about enough of that yet? Do you mind? - What? It's totally ridiculous. Was the lady walking up the center aisle of that church ridiculous? Why should she be? - Exactly. She was parading with a man she didn't love. Now you're parading with a man you don't love. You're not doing so badly either. Put that back in your pocket. Anything you suggest, my dear. That's better. You know, you wouldn't be so bad if you were sober. It's why I'm getting you off the streets. Get in there. Bonjour, mademoiselle. Hello Marcel. - Entré, Monsieur. A shot of whiskey for the gentleman. Huh? How do I know? I can smell the brand. I will have a chicken sandwich and a cup of coffee. Très bien. - Pardon me. A quart of champagne and two glasses. - Oui, Monsieur. Listen, I'm not celebrating with you. What's the arrangement? A Turkish bath for you. You need a steam and a sleep. Fine. So I can wake up around midnight and think. Well, you've got to get over it sometime. About the time the steamer sails? Oh .. she'll be on it, huh? They'll be on it. - Hard luck. Forget it. You and I are going places. I'm going to work. Work? Believe it or not, I do. This is my lunch hour. You are using up the time so you can buy the lunch. A model? Don't be funny. I sew on labels. Three dollars a day. You need a vacation. - I'll get plenty, starting Saturday. They are laying a bunch of us off. Aright. You are sewing labels on me until Saturday. Hey, give us that sandwich. I'm going to sit over here. Marcel. I'm buying my own. I'm sorry I'm not dexterous enough to avoid that chip on your shoulder. I've been awkward for some days. Here. Get something on your stomach. When did you eat last? I shan't be upset by inquisitiveness if you tell me when you expect to eat next. I can take good care of myself. I wish you would pass the secret along. How could any get girl get you like this? I only know it can be done. I could have socked myself once. Then you ought to know what it's like. I do. Let's drink to 'em. 0kay. May the two who left us always be happy. Here, let's try this one. - Wait. Bonjour, Messieurs. Asseyez-vous. We are joining this party. Well, what a nice depressing sight you both are. - Hello, Geoffrey. We caught a glimpse of you marching down the avenue. Let me present you to Miss .. I must go. I wouldn't introduce you to anyone you shouldn't know. I'm glad you found him. You chase along with them. - We'll all have a drink. You are making a mistake, Geoffrey. I made one. I guess I can make another. So you trot off to your wedding reception. Come along Geoffrey. Take hold, Tony. Taking me out of here? - We are. - Watch your step. I haven't had a fight in a restaurant .. Since I protected the honor of a mademoiselle from Armentieres. Sid down while I tell you about it. - I'm going. Oh, no you don't. - Alright, Geoff. We'll drink some wine with you. - Swell. You won't mind one more? Will you go with them then if I do? I make no alcoholic commitments. Sit down. Well, I'll get a couple of glasses for myself. What's he going after, the lady's credentials? They are excellent. Marcel, can I go out this way? - Sure. Just a minute. I'll sneak out. You can handle him. I'm afraid if you try, he'll tear the place down. Oh yeah? I call the Cops. Hold on. You know this girl? She's okay. She works at Hawkheimers. 0h. You'd better keep out of crowds and learn to size people up right. I do apologise. Take two more glasses in will you. You'll have to help us out. I suppose you think you are of some great importance to me. If you get him to his club and a Turkish bath there will be $100 waiting for you. Well. Well I can't very well afford to turn that down. I'll give you my number and the club's in case he passes out and you need help. He's got a big roll. You had better take it off him. - I'm afraid I can't. I'm glad you mentioned it though. - Anyhow, you know. I don't think I caught your name. Miriam Brady. I live at 1650 Tenth Avenue. It's sort of a .. a working girls club. You can ring them up if you want to. You got to be alright to get in. We'll take a chance on you, Miss Brady. College Club. Who? Oh yes. His friends had been hoping we'd hear something before this. I just wanted you to know that he's alright. We're at Marshans. Say listen. This man has got a mind of his own. I got him to go to the barber though. He looks swell now. As a matter of fact, we both do. He wouldn't shave .. Until I went across the street to a shop and bought myself a whole new outfit. And I thought, as long as I was going to be seen in places with him. I'd better look good. - Ah, sufficiency. I thought you were calling a friend. - Well, they are your friends. What do you think I'm sitting here trying to forget them for? I'm sorry. Listen, mister. I'm beginning to feel this. You're lucky. I wish you were having half as much fun as I am. Gee, I never thought I'd be in a joint like this. You've been mighty sweet. Keeping me from going crazy all day. Now, please. The boat left the dock half an hour ago. Let's dance. What do you say? She's alone with him. Look, you've been swell up to now. Don't go to pieces. Don't leave me. I can't be alone. I'm sticking. I've got my arm around you. Right here in a public place too. You're just a little boy that wants to be petted. Ah, let's get drunk. 0kay. Hey, waiter. Bring us another bottle. For a crying jag? Do we get it here or do we get it somewhere else? Okay, Miss. - You're fresh. You won't let me down, will you. Not for a minute, darling. Hey! What happened last night? Did I marry you? Yes. The end of a perfect day. How about a drink? There is some orange juice and other stuff coming up from the drug-store. Swell. Ooh, that helps. Intelligent drinking from me, wasn't it. Champagne on top of everything else. All I can bite off is stale balloon gas. Here. What's this? - Well .. It says that we didn't know what we were doing and .. And I haven't got any claim on you. You're a lawyer. You can get an annulment, can't you? Sure. Your money is under the pillow. We didn't blow very much. I let you hand the court clerk 25 dollars. Because you woke him up at 3 o'clock in the morning. You wanted to give him a hundred. The taxi driver got ten dollars for being a witness. The taxi bill was $16.50 Here. Here, you count it. Let's avoid mathematics until I get a pick-up. [ Door knocks ] Well, here it is. Come in. How much is the seltzer? - Seventy-five. There you are, boy. Where are we? - Harrison. Where is that? - New York. I'll make a note of it. Get me a quart of respectable bourbon. - Yes, sir. Oh, Mr Sherwood, please. - Mrs Sherwood. If you study our marriage licence you'll discover that my first name is Geoffrey. Drink this. These flannels must be a wedding gift. Did you make them, Miriam? No, I got the outfit from the night clerk. Here is your orange juice. You certainly take excellent are of me, Miriam. You needn't rub it in. You can get rid of me any way you like. I don't want anything. I don't even want this. Did I buy you a wedding ring? Yeah. From the court clerk. He keeps them for suckers just like you. It'll be valuable as evidence. You'd better keep it. I don't want any hold on you. Why did you go to the trouble of marrying me then? Well, I was all glowed up on champagne. I felt sorry for you. I'm beginning to remember now. You were awful brooding about those two on the boat. You said that I was the only one who could keep it off your mind. You begged me to stick to you. I guess I got the crazy idea that you really needed me. So, when you asked me to marry you. I thought it sounded swell. When we got back here. You fell asleep. Sobbing in my arms. Well. I guess all I can say is .. I'm sorry. Well, you probably kept me out of the river last night. Not that it makes any difference. You don't have to talk like that. It will all be washed up in two week's time. You will have forgotten about her and me too. I'll never bother you. Come in. Take that bottle out. - No you don't. Paid. - Thank you. I give up. You are hopeless. Let's go back to New York. Maybe your friends can handle you. You go if you like. I'll be more comfortable here. - I see. Lapping that up, huh? Tomorrow or the next day you're to call on Harold Chase, New York City bank. He'll have something for you. - Oh no you don't. Well. Thanks for everything, Miriam. And goodbye. You want to stay here alone so that you can drink yourself to death, huh? Well, I'd be delighted to have you with me but you'd be better off not. This is the first time I've seen you sober. Now I can tell you. You can't take it. I'm afraid I can't, so why bother? So let's say .. - No, I don't mean that. Your nerves are shot or you would see it different. Get yourself into good shape and you'll realize you never really loved the dame. You're too smart to love a .. Take it easy, now. - Listen. Last night you cried on my shoulder but didn't know what you were crying about. You were like some little kid that got started and couldn't stop. That's straight. You didn't know what you were crying about. You'd forgot her. So what? Keep on crying if it will make you feel any better, and you'll come out of it. Cry all you want to. On your shoulder? Sure. If you like. I'll stick with you until you're normal again. I don't want to be normal again. I'm much more comfortable as I am. But you can give yourself a chance, can't you? You can always go back to this. Listen. Let's take a motor bus and go up into the Adirondacks. I've not seen the mountains .. But I've read all about them in those folders the bus companies give out. Gee, it must be swell this time of year with everything turning green. We'll take a cabin somewhere. Maybe on a lake. Cook our own meals and you can taper off on this so you'll never notice it. Gee, I in few weeks you'd love it. - And then what? Well, goodbye. Then the same as here. Oh, I couldn't use you like that. Don't worry about me. Tell me honestly. Are you falling for me? Well, I guess I must like you a little or I wouldn't want to help you so much. You're my wife remember. - I've got sense enough to realise that. No. I'll stay with you as long as you need me. And then we'll quit. Friends. You'll never regret it. - No, I'm sure I won't. Go and get dressed and we'll get out of here. Wait a minute. I'm the bottom. You're the tops. For a while. Wait here. This seems to be the place alright. But why live in Washington Square? I don't get it. He's been consoling himself. That's a cinch. Well, here it is. Oh. Oh, hello. We are looking for a Mr Sherwood. Well, this is it. Not bad. I guess you don't remember me. I never came back for that hundred. Oh, of course. So that's why he's been hiding out on us. Well, we thought he was up to something, but never .. This is marvellous. Well Geoff will be back in a few minutes. Won't you come in? Thank you. - Thank you. How long has he been back? Oh about .. about six weeks. We just heard where he could be found. We thought we'd dig him out. Swell. Oh, this is Mrs Martin. How do you do. - How do you do. I don't believe I got your names. I'm Hewlett. This is Mr Brown. Mr Hewlett - Mr Brown. Brown? Say .. You're not giving me phony names are you? Not at all. I knew Mr Hewlett's father. Quite well. Why, you don't say so. But that was many, many years ago. When I was in the Florodora Sextet. Well, that was before my time. You may not know it young man. But one gay winter your advent into this world hung precariously in the balance. Really? Your father wanted to marry me. I can understand that. Had it not been for a substantial check from your grandfather .. You wouldn't be here now. Well, I must be going. - We're not driving you out? Not at all. I make a point of calling on all of my tenants at cocktail time. Oh, you're the landlady? Well .. I own the building. It has doubled in value since your grandfather's time. If he knew it, he'd have rolled in his grave. Goodbye. Goodbye, Mrs Martin. - Goodbye, dear. Goodbye. Bye-bye, chicken. - Bye. Goodbye, gentlemen. Oh, why didn't I live in Ben Franklin's day? She's been a mighty good friend to me. As though you needed one. You are coming right along. Won't you sit down? - Thanks. This looks cosy. Like it? Mrs Martin helped me fix it up. That woman is an artist. I think Geoffrey likes it too. - Well, he ought to. He'll be tickled to death to see you two. Well, you want a drink? We'll never survive this if we don't. Tell us about Geoff. Oh, he's swell. Since the big drunk, we've only had one note because he was travelling. We imagined alone. No .. I was tagging along. To date old Geoff. Has the work turned? Like an adagio dancer? There you are. - Thank you. Well, he certainly went about forgetting his troubles in the right way. Did he pick that outfit for you? - No. Mrs Martin helped me with it. Ah. So he's grooming you for big things? Too bad Geoff is an orphan. Aren't you drinking? - No. Not without Geoffrey. That's devotion. How is he doing with his self? Everything is pretty well under control. Honestly? Well Brady, if you've done that to him, you're immense. Did you notice? I remembered your name. Miriam Brady. That's right. I think we ought to celebrate the boy's return. How about tonight? I wish you'd take him. He never goes anywhere. The phone? - Over there. I know just the two girls we need. Pearl and Vi. They used to work for Ziggy. Geoff knows them. Geoff. Well, you old scoundrel. Hello, fellows. I thought I recognised your voices. - So you've been hiding out on us, eh? How did you find me? One of the drivers from the club drove you home here one night. He tipped us off. - I see. Who were you calling? Pearl and Vi. We're going to celebrate. Are you are asking those two here? Why not? What's wrong? Have I made a mistake? Oh that's alright, Geoff. Why didn't you tell them we're married? Well, if you can't guess .. Take a look at their faces. It would be easier for you if your friends didn't know. Sure. We're married. But the minute he wants me to. I get out. That's our agreement. Well, there is nothing so horrible about that. Well .. no, of course not. I want to apologise, Geoff. Oh that's alright. You shouldn't put people on the spot like that. It's awkward. You can't go on hiding out like this. The rest of your friends will dig you out the way these two did. The thing for you to do is to go and meet them and .. Keep quiet about me. I don't care what they think. - Don't get that nonsense in your head. Well, you talk it over with them, and .. I'll go down and return these books that I borrowed from Mrs Martin. Alright. Tell her we three might go out and dine later. You think she'd like to? Why can't we all go? We'll see. So long. We'll see you again. - Yes. Sit down, fellows. Come in. Can I visit with you while Geoff sees his friends? Indeed you may .. visit with me. That's right. May I. How did you like the books? - Oh, they were .. They were splendid. I have another one for you. You know it's awful sweet of you to lend me books and watch my speech for me. It can't be much fun for you. I shall have my fun. The day your husband wakes up to the fact that he can take you .. anywhere. I wonder if that will ever be. - Sooner than you think. You have a perfect ear. You can wear clothes. Why, your husband's friends didn't know you. What do you suppose they are saying up there? I wonder. And here we are. And that's the whole fantastic story. What's going to happen?- I suppose we'll go on as we are for some time. Falling for her? Ha. My falling days are over. She's amusing. Keeps me sober. I suppose I'd be going under the daisies by now if it weren't for her. Gratitude? - Maybe. I must keep her happy as long as I can. - After a time you'll be sick of her. Then she'll let me go without trouble. Of course, I'll see she never wants for anything. You can't go on leading this kind of life indefinitely. Avoiding your friends. Giving up everything that means a darn to you. What about the firm? Do they know? They'd be enchanted with this set up. Especially as my chief drag with them was my social connections. Well, I've resigned. No. My last act of alcoholic bravado before Miriam got me on the wagon. Well, why not? After all, what's a little thing like the future. Now I'm in oil. So is a sardine. Just to prove I'm not avoiding you here's my office address. This will interest Valentine. "Geoffrey Sherwood. Crimson Pass Oil Company. 83 Wall Street." She is back from Europe, I suppose? She rings up to ask if you've been heard from about every other day. Why? Anxious, I suppose. Don't remind. [ Buzzer ] "Mr Sherwood, this is the day for the report to go to the bank." Very well. Mail it. So, you won't step out to lunch with me? No. I think a man's business hours should be for his business. And a wife shouldn't butt in. I mean, a wife shouldn't intrude. If she brings his galoshes to town as it looks like rain then she rates a lunch. Nope. I told Miss Mansfield I will have lunch with her. Bye. Well. I'm ready to go any time the boss says you can, Miss Mansfield. I usually go at noon. That enables Mr Sherwood to get away by one. Well, you needn't hurry back today so don't bolt your food. I'll keep the office until you come back. In another month I'll be able to afford a decent sized office staff. So long. Thanks for the galoshes. Wait. Hey .. that's some dress you've got on. I was wondering when you were going to notice it. Much too smart to waist on a drug-store lunch counter. Well, I asked her out but she turned me down. Alright. Where will we go, the Waldorf or Sherrys? Well. I'd take you if it weren't so far uptown. Well make it .. make it Belmont Park? Some Saturday? Next Saturday. That's a date. Watch me knock them over when I cross the lawn in this. Who is that blond with Sherwood? I never saw her before in my life. I do admire his taste in women. Oh, she's wearing that Carnegie I was crazy about. But I simply couldn't wear it. Not until I get this down. Would be nice if you could wear it like she does. Bye. - Bye. [ Telephone ] Hello? Why, Valentine? You sound startled, Geoff. I'm in a jewellers not far from your office. I'll drop in if you don't mind. Yes .. do, by all means. I won't be more than ten minutes. - Well, there is plenty of time. What is it? - That bank report. It should be in the two o'clock mail. I almost forgot it. Can I stay in here? May I stay in here? Why, of course. What are you thinking about? Go ahead. I'll read. I've just had a telephone call from Mrs Marland. Oh .. that's nice. She happens to be in a jewellers close by. She's dropping in for a minute. I suppose you'll be interested to see her, won't you? Oh no. No, I'll be going, - Well, there is no necessity. Well, she is coming to see you and .. Besides. You don't want me on exhibition. Miriam, don't talk like that. - I didn't mean that crack. Sorry. It will just be more comfortable. If I weren't here. Well, I'll .. I'll see you later. I'll meet you down at the drug-store. Down? Oh, go ahead. First corridor to your left. [ Door knocks ] I hope I'm not intruding at a busy moment. Of course not. Won't you sit down. You know, I hadn't the slightest intention of calling on you. But when I found myself so near your office. Is the first time you've thought of me since our last meeting? Why, of course not. I've thought of you often. One of the reasons I came here today was .. I knew were bound to meet somewhere sooner or later. I thought it would be better if we met like this first. I don't see why we were bound to meet. Well, we've so many mutual friends. I never see them now. - No? You have dropped them all? - Most of them, completely. I .. heard of your marriage. Is that why you dropped us? Not altogether. Although my wife isn't a society girl. Well .. that's no reason why you shouldn't see us. It's a pity to lose one's friends. I'm very busy building up a new business. Oh. So she is acquiring charm. Hmm. How is she doing, Geoff? Why did you really come up here, Valentine? Of course you'll believe nothing but what's bad of me. Well, I wish you hadn't come. It's no satisfaction to either of us to meet like this. You are awfully practical, Geoff. So were you when you married Marland. - No, I was ignorant then. Ignorant of what marriage really means. You haven't come here to tell me .. That you found it's too late and you've made a mistake? My husband treats me very well. Much better than I deserve. He is extremely generous an attentive. Too attentive. Oh, I shouldn't have said that. I'm sorry, Geoff. If you knew what it was like not to be able to speak one's thoughts to anyone. I have no-one to talk to. No-one. I feel so lost and .. I can't help you. You've gone right out of my world. You're Marland's wife now. After having been what I was to you I'll not sink down to being your confidante. I wish you hadn't come. Yes, I know. You've told me that already. It's time I was getting home anyway. Going up for the big game next month? I won't be able to. - Really? It's will be a good one. Oh, I don't know. - Look who's here. Well, hello Miriam. - Haven't seen you in months. I know. Geoff and I have been as busy as bird dogs. May I present Mr Marland. This is Mrs Sherwood. Oh, how do you do. - How do you do. Well. I spend most of my time in the library and poor Geoff is working all the time. He only takes a couple of hours a week off for golf. He's out this afternoon. Well, I've just remembered. I've left the theater tickets at the club. I'm very pleased to have met you, Mrs Sherwood. Same here. - I'll see you later then. I suppose you know who he is? - Sure. He looks kind of down in the dumps. How has she been treating him? - Well, he moved back to the club. Aha. How are you and Geoff getting along? Couldn't be better. What do you think? We're going to South America. Geoff will handle that end of the business. Why that's fine, Miriam. He'll get by better with me down there. Someday I'll come back to New York .. With a South American accent and everything will be hunky dory. It looks as though things will be permanent, doesn't it. Well. I'm beginning to hope so. Well, I got to get along. Bye. - Goodbye. Good afternoon, Mr Marland. - How are you? We are showing the Blakeley collection. Do come in. Well, I am waiting for a lady. Possibly. I'm sure you will find something quite worthwhile. How are you, Mrs Sherwood? Why, yes. Have you seen the Blakeley collection? I'm not very much up on art. I know but I'm so anxious to speak to you. Might we go into the gallery? Sure. I guess so. Shall we sit here? Alright. It's back here, Mr Marland. Yes. Later, later. We'll spend a little time on this. Oh yes. Yes. You and your husband are planning a trip to South America. Aren't you? - Why, yes. And your husband is to postpone the date of departure? Yes. Well, Mrs Sherwood. If it is possible. I hope you will persuade him to go at once. But why? Well, Valentine and I have started living apart. That's too bad. - For no apparent reason. A sort of "vacation" she says. We're getting on each other's nerves. Geoff has nothing to do with it if that's what you think. Oh no, not deliberately, but .. But, he is the reason for Valentine's action. What do you mean? Well. I'm not considered brilliant. Easy to fool and all that, Mrs Sherwood. But .. I haven't told a soul but Valentine is after your husband. Listen. Nothing gets by me. Geoff has only seen her once since you married her. She came to the office once a few months ago. I don't know what Geoff told her. But I can guess. She never came back. You don't know Valentine. His recovery? Why, it was a harsh disappointment. He needs to stay recovered. Why do you suppose he stays away from the places they used to go to together? On account of me? I begged him to go without me. He doesn't want to see her. He's on to her. Yes. And then she got desperate and left me. So that I wouldn't be in the way. - And I suppose I'm not in the way? Well, I am sorry to be blunt, Mrs Sherwood. But Valentine doesn't think that you are. Well she can't see him if he doesn't want to see her. Read this. If Geoff had met her he'd have told me. She's only been at it a week. But give her time. But there is nothing I can do. I've done all I can. But get him away if you can. Well, I'd let her have him if I thought he'd be happy. He wouldn't be .. any more than I've been. Only somehow, I can't bear the thought of losing her. I know. Good luck. Thanks. Mr Marland. I am sorry Mr Marland wouldn't see the exhibit. He had to go. - You'll see it won't you? These paintings were recently shown in the Ledger Gallery in London. You will find .. There's a certain harmony that exists between all these exhibits .. That is both soothing and agreeable. Sure. It's marvellous. My husband and I aren't buying any pictures right now. We're going to start travelling. Want some more coffee, Geoff? - No thanks. You're a bit quiet tonight. Are you tired? A little. You haven't said very much yourself. A lot of on my mind. What? Business? Yes. Mostly. How was your game today? So-so. What did you do? Oh, spent most of the afternoon in the library. You know, before long you'll be a highbrow. Coming out I ran into Tony and Hugh. Really? What do you think? Mr Marland was with them. Oh .. well? Did you know they had separated? - I heard they had. He is sort of out of his head about it. That dame certainly has the ability to drive men bugs. He kept wanting to talk to me. What about? Well .. I'll show you. He gave me this. He was pretty excited about it. There is just enough truth in this to make it nasty for Valentine. Oh? Treating her like a dog. As a matter of fact she did come out there. Hoping she'd run across me. Well, she had to talk to someone. And you were the only one? I'm one of her oldest friends. - Oh, yes. She has certainly treated you like one. - Don't let's get on a dangerous topic. You are right. Your friends are none of my business. But when it comes to that woman. I guess I can't take it. You know, Miriam. I know, Geoff. Say it. Don't be upset about what Marland told you. I won't. Why don't you and Agnes go to a picture? Are you going out somewhere? Yes, to the office. Oh. One evening this week however, I'll have to call on Valentine. Despite that clipping and what Marland told you, I've only run across her once. That was this afternoon on a public golf course. Didn't talk at any length out there. Of course not. She's pretty much alone in this now. Her mother is siding with Marland. She's asked for my advice. The least I can do is give her what little I can. Her husband loves her, Geoff. Perhaps. Do you? My dear, until now we've kept away from that subject very nicely. But she's no good. She's just a heel. What did she do to you? Left you in the gutter, a drunk. Just because I picked you up and helped make a man of you. She can't bear to keep her hands off you. She is nothing but a common, little .. Geoff. I'm sorry. 0kay. Who is calling? Well, won't you give the name please? Is that necessary? I'm a friend of a friend of Mrs Marland's. Alright. Tell her that Mrs Sherwood is calling. Mrs Geoffrey Sherwood. Come in. I'm calling that woman. She's been trying to see Geoff. Oh. Oh, she won't talk to me, huh? You tell her that she can .. - Now, now, now. She'd only call Geoff and tell him that you are annoying her. Alright. I'm going to her house. I'm going to see her. You will never do it that way, dear. - She's running after Geoff. He's kept away from her but she runs after him and I'm going to stop her. And if you go haywire now .. You will spoil everything. - Well, I'm nearly crazy. Geoff is going to see her soon. She's asked him to. Well, you want to frighten her off? But you'll never do it by making a scene outside her home. And that is as far as you'll ever get. I suppose you're right. She'd pretend she didn't know I was out there and call the Cops and .. I'd end up in the night court. She'd like that you know. She'd love to throw it up to Geoff that he married a guttersnipe. Well, I'm learning. I've learned a lot thanks to you. I can walk in the Waldorf and conduct myself like a lady as well as she can. If .. you don't lose your head. And I won't. - Good. I'm going to give that dame a shock. Huh? What the ..? Now, what are you up to? Well I found something. I saw it a while ago. She is giving a luncheon at .. At the Waldorf for a girlfriend. Some swell club. Here. There it is. And it's tomorrow. But you are not going to make a scene there I hope? A scene? I'm going to get a table next to hers. I'll have the bellboy page Mrs Geoffrey Sherwood until it makes her ears ache. And after she's got an eyeful of Mrs Geoffrey Sherwood. She'll realise that I'll do better in a divorce scandal .. Than anybody she'd like to be up against. As a matter of fact. After her and her girlfriends get good and interested. I think I'll go up and introduce myself. Good heavens. - Better come along and see the show. I wouldn't miss it for the world. He married some factory girl in a moment of inebriation. But I believe he's quite over it now. Two madame? - Where is Max? He's holding a table. - Just a second, please. There she is. - Don't nudge. That must be the table you ordered behind her. I ought to be facing her. - Yes, I've arranged for all that. Tell Max it won't do and be sure she hears you. Raise your voice just enough. And watch your grammar. Look who's here. How do you do, Mrs Martin? Mrs Sherwood has a table reserved. Oh yes. This way please. Well, what an entrance, eh? Half way down the room. Here is a man that wants to bother you. Well, how do you do? Just a Belmont tout. We're passing him. Is this the table? - Yes, ma'am. But I have no intention of sitting behind that pillar. I am sorry. This is the only table for two we have left, madame. Well, I telephoned this morning. "Mrs Geoffrey Sherwood"? If you will sit here just a moment, Mrs Sherwood. I'll have another table set up for you. If you could put it the other side of that party. There seems to be room. Very well. She got it. How do you do it? Well. Back in the dear old Florodora days .. Max's father was head waiter at Delmonico's. And I always saw that he was well looked after. Some woman seems to be breaking her neck to see you. Your table is ready, Mrs Sherwood. Thank you, Marcel. My husband has dieted and exercised until it is just pathetic. But it hasn't had the slightest effect. He's just a shadow of his former self. Now that I get a good look at her she's not such a mutt. Darling. Mind your expressions. We will. We'll just sit quietly here. And give her a bad half hour. I've impressed her alright. She realizes now she's not taking on any tramp. Darling. You are under a terrific strain. So confine yourself purely to pantomime. Would you like to order? What shall we have? You order. - Well. We might begin with a cocktail. Martini, sec?? And .. caviar la rousse? Caviar? Is that alright for you, dear? - Oh yes. Yes. Don't be long. Yes, madame. We had better bow to someone. How do you do? You would pick out an acquitted murderess. Try it again. Someone at her table. With your most pained expression. How do you do? Do you know her? I can't think where we've met. Who is she? I've no idea. Interesting looking. Just the sort of person you'd like to know. Yes, isn't she. She's a washout. Stop glaring at her like that. I can't help it. Each time I think of Geoff going to see her, I .. But you must frighten her off by appearing to be superior to it all. That is the idea. Isn't it? Well, I don't feel like that. - Well, you must feel it. To look it. You must submerge yourself in the part. You are too much of a lady, too well-bred, too secure of your position. To suffer the slightest concerns over your husband's peccadilloes. Another cocktail might do it. Waiter. That is so much better. And is she squirming, huh? She's getting rattled alright. You know, I'm just beginning to get the feeling I need. Back in the Florodora days. I invariably gave my best performance after champagne. That is superb. So she won't talk to me. Well, after listening to those dames chatter, I think I can mix in alright. Oh no you can't. Well I can crack back at anything I've heard her say. What are you going to do? - I'm going over to introduce myself. For heaven's sake, don't make a scene. Don't worry about me. I can be just as Park Avenue as any of them. It tell you it would be simply tremendous. If we could get the right leader. But among the younger men, who is there? How do you do, Mrs Marland. May I introduce myself? I'm Mrs Geoffrey Sherwood. Oh. Are you really? Yes. I thought that since you and Geoff were such good friends. That we ought to know each other. I haven't seen or heard of Mr Sherwood in quite some time. Geoff said he enjoyed that game with you at the municipal golf links yesterday. Well, what a preposterous creature. You know, I never thought you would play at the municipal golf course. I thought naturally .. - Are you aware this is a private party? Yes, I think it is delightful. You know, since you've asked Geoff to call on you evenings .. We really must know each other. Will you go away. If you had talked to me on the phone last evening I wouldn't be here today. But I am very curious to know what you want of my husband. Especially since you threw him in the gutter for a richer man. No idea of cheating, I suppose? Well, I'm afraid I'll have to go. - If you do, my dear. I'll put that grapefruit smack in your face. I'm sorry I had to say that. You are not a good enough sport to talk to me. So I've got to make you. When you dumped Geoff .. He was ready to drink himself to death and jump in the river. I suppose you'd have been flattered if he had? Well, I put him on his feet. Is there any reason why you can't leave him alone? Perhaps he feels he belongs among people of his own kind. Anytime Geoff feels like that he can go. He knows that. But I'm not going to have him stolen from me. Especially by you. You've no idea what you're saying. - Oh, yes I have. Geoff would never have gone after you of his own accord. You looked him up and then you played on his sympathy. You miserable little street gamin. You need his help do you? Your good-natured husband whose money you are spending abuses you? Why you horrid little blackmailer! Sometimes I do that. But my aim is better. Good afternoon, ladies. I'm sorry I've got you in a jam. I like it. I haven't seen my name in the paper for twenty-five years. I'm the hotel reporter, madam. What's your version? Never. Since the Grand Duke Boris kissed my neck in public. Have I been so humiliated. [ Telephone ] Hello? Is he home yet? Oh, I am sure it will be alright. I was just wishing that you could get some sleep. Well, I am too excited. I'm not worrying though. Why should I be? It will probably open Geoff's eyes to the kind she is. Hold the phone. He's coming upstairs now. Thanks. Hello. - Take a look at this. She did make an awful fool of herself but I'm sorry it got in the papers. Too bad you had to do it. Me? I didn't throw the grapefruit. - Does it make any difference? What do you mean, does it make any difference? What are you looking for? - My grey suit. I sent it out to be pressed. - I see. Doesn't it make any difference to you .. who makes a scene? You went to make a scene, didn't you? I went there to ask her to leave my husband alone. You picked a fine place. Where's the blue suit? I sent that out too. I suppose I didn't have any right to be at the Waldorf? But I behaved myself just as properly as anybody there, I'll have you know. Look at the headlines: "Mrs Valentine Marland hurls grapefruit." "Society women stage battle." That includes me too. They took me for a society woman. And she was the one that made a fool of herself. You can ask Mrs Martin. I never even raised my voice. I .. I suppose you've been talking this over with her? Yes, I have. Don't you think you ought to hear my side of it before you get sore? I'm not sore, Miriam. I've thought this over very carefully all evening. Yes. With her. I can't see that matters. You talked me over with her as if was a freak from some sideshow or something. How about talking her over with me? I might give you a few good tips too. But I'm in the wrong class. Even if I don't sling grapefruit at people in public. Oh, it isn't fair. Can't you see my side of it? I do, Miriam. I'm not blaming you for what happened this afternoon. I only wanted to ask her to leave you alone because .. Well, I love you so much. You are mine in a way. I'm trying to tell you that I blame myself for everything. Oh, darling. Darling, let's forget it. I'll try very hard to please you. Maybe I'll show up better when we get to South America. I can't take you to South America, Miriam. Oh. Now let me talk, will you. I did a very cruel thing by never letting you come into this bargain. My mind was numb or I would have sent you away that morning. Then you'd have ended up in the morgue. At the sight of hurting you like this, I wish I had. So, you're through with me? - Ah, don't put it that way. We both knew it had to come sometime. I guess I forgot. My dear, it is the only way out for both of us. We're too far apart in every way. You've let me go on loving you more and more. I know. I couldn't bring myself to hurt you. I'm terribly fond of you, Miriam. I always swill be. In six months or a year from now. You will realise that this is the right thing to do. Of course, you will always be provided for, but .. Even with that .. I know I can never repay you. I'm terribly sorry, Miriam. Where are you going? I'm going over to the club for the time being. Oh. Oh, so you're going to love out to the club. Like the perfect gentleman. Why not throw me out tonight? Out on the street where you picked me up. Please. You don't do it that way. You ditch your women with dignity, don't you. You leave them the apartment, a check on the dresser and move out to the club. Miriam. - Give me that. Miriam! You won't move out on me, as I'm going to spoil your act for you. Listen, will you. - Listen to you, nothing! That's all I've done since I first met you. Listened to your hooey. How I ate it up. And for what? So I'll be fit to associate with a cut-rate gigolo like you? That's all you are at heart. A gigolo! You don't take money from women but you take something better. Something you haven't got: guts! Oh, no you don't. You can't stand on your own feet. The minute a woman walks out from under you, you flop in the mud. And lay there until another woman comes and picks you up. That's what I did. Well I guess I was lonely. I wanted some love. I thought you wanted love too. But you don't know what the word means. And now that you're the big strong stuffed-shirt again. The vulgar little fool that helped you out might cramp your style. He's embarrassed by the way she holds her fork. So he's taking his dress suit and his topper. And he's moving out to the club. Well get this. You're not moving out on me. There isn't a heel in the world that is going to do that. Because I'm moving out on you. Miriam. Mrs Martin, Mrs Martin. Let me in. Miriam! Quick, will you! Darling, take this will you. Just a little. Take this. Just a sip. Just to please me. Sweetheart, don't cry. Just a sip. Now I'll get you something to make you sleep. That isn't ..? He's coming down. Oh, Martin. Martin, he's gone. He's gone. Good evening, Mr Sherwood. - Alright, Charlie. That's alright. Well, Mr Sherwood. - Well, James. I seem to be a regular. It certainly seems like old times seeing you walk in. I suppose your curiosity yearns to be satisfied? Well, this is not the same jag that I walked out with a year ago. Although there are certain aspects that have an unfortunate resemblance. [ Telephone ] Do talk to him, dear. It's only fair. No. - Oh, honey. You'll regret this all your life. No I won't, I tell you. - Oh, alright. You little idiot. Hello? Hello, Geoff. No, she won't talk to you, dear. No. Well, she is going to take a train tomorrow. To Reno. I have reasoned with her until I'm black in the face. And it is no use. You must definitely get rid of the other woman, then perhaps she'd speak to you. You needn't tell him that. You know I'm through. She says not to give you any encouragement. You certainly spoke your little piece at the wrong time. Goodbye. Goodbye, Geoff. Poor boy. He sounds to me as if he'd been drinking. Well she can nurse him out of it this time. On grapefruit juice. How about a room? - Just for tonight? Indefinitely. - That is nice. How are you, Mr Sherwood? Decidedly uncommunicative, Nicky. Yes, sir. Take Mr Sherwood's bag to his old room. - Yes, sir. [ Singing ] A musical evening? - Oh, that's Mr Marland. I didn't know he did that. - That's something new. [ Singing ] Hello, Geoff. - Hello, Geoff. [ Singing ] Hello, John. Well, it's old friend Sherwood. Have a snifter. Herbert. - Yes, sir? What will you have, sir? - That will do for me. I just moved back to the club. Well, here we are. I want to say I'm sorry for what's happened. You couldn't help it. My wife wanted you and that's that. But it's all wrong, John. No, no. Don't be sappy. I shouldn't have come between you two birds in the first place. You don't quite get me. - Now listen. I like you in spite of what's happened. You mean Valentine's happiness. Well now. If I can help it, nothing is going to stand between Valentine and happiness. But that isn't the angle. - Ah, forget it, Geoff. Let's collect our things. What are you looking so morose about? I'm the one who ought to look sad. Don't you feel we're rather precipitating matters, John? Why? You've been in love with each other for years, haven't you? But we can't think only of ourselves. Now listen. I can take it. And so can that other little lady. She's got class. Imagine making Valentine throw a grapefruit. That's the point. We're letting a measly grapefruit change the whole course of our lives. Pathetic. Why? It didn't hit anybody. But it sent me home to row with Miriam. It ended by her telling me to get out. Well, you were going to walk out on her in any case, weren't you? I suppose so, eventually. Well she beat you to it. So what's the difference? Well it's hard to explain but it makes you see it from a different angle. So that's what you're celebrating, huh? I've been a blind fool, John. So now that you've blown the works, you don't want to go on with it, eh? No, I don't. If I wasn't so relieved I could swing at you. I couldn't be more humiliated if you did. Go home where you belong. I can't. When I've broken with Valentine Miriam may listen to me. Come on, then. Where? Oh sit down. It's three in the morning. Come on, come on. Bring your drink. Come on. Shush. Do you want to wake her up? Well, that's what we came for, didn't we? Yeah. That's right. Oh. - Huh? We left our drinks in the cab. No. No more for me. What's wrong, Mr Marland? Go back to bed and stop prowling. But Mrs Marland has retired. A smart fellow. Keeps abreast of the times. Hadn't you better let your man go ahead? What for? I know the way. But Mr Marland .. Is that you, John? Yes, darling. Will you go back to your club. You've been drinking. So has Geoffrey. Oh. Is he there? Well .. I wouldn't have the impertinence to come alone. What on earth made you bring John here? There is something I must tell you tonight, Valentine. And I am here in the capacity of a chaperone. Necessitated by altered circumstances. Oh. Come in. Come in, come in. Well, what's happened? That wife of yours means to make trouble, I suppose? Now listen. She is above that. Far above it. Oh, shut up. Well, good luck Geoff, if I don't see you again. Well, what is it? Don't keep me in suspense. We've been so keen on getting together again, Valentine. I wonder if we've ever had time to know our real feelings. What brought that up? Are you satisfied that we have? We want each other. Don't we? It's hard to say it, but feeling as I do now .. It wouldn't be fair to Miriam. You weren't talking like that earlier in the evening. What's come over you? I wish I could explain without seeming too brutal but .. I'm afraid I can't. I went from here directly to Miriam to tell her I was leaving. Shortly afterwards I found myself standing on the sidewalk. Bag in hand. It dawned on me then. What Miriam really meant to me. I can't imagine why I didn't realize it before. Oh. You love her? Yes. Goodbye, Geoff. Bye. Geoff! Let go. Let go I tell you! You know I don't want to see you. Remember that ring I married you wîth? - I've never worn it. Well, here is what I want you to wear from now on. # s d # ö ö
