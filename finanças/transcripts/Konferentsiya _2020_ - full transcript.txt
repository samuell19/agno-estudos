He laid for the whole day in the hallway while they were away. They couldn't reach him on the phone so they came back. They placed him immediately in intensive care. They said it was a massive stroke. They knew it was a stroke already while in the ambulance. Galya… She asked not to tell you anything. Let's remember our kids. For my Vovka. -You again? -Yes.

Wait a second. Your day is tomorrow. Not today. What do you mean? I was told by the management that tomorrow is the day for hostages. There will be a guest list. Can't I come in for just five minutes? You have to understand I can’t let you in without a guest list. That’s what I was told. If you have any questions, go see the management they'll let you in.

We would like to invite him. At eight o'clock, after the evening service, we wanted to gather in the theatre. Tell him, please. Thank you. Do you eat chops? Meat ones? No, fish ones. Yes, I eat it. I’ll give you a couple? No, just one. So far, there aren’t many people who come tomorrow. How many people came last year? Even less. Even less? On the 23rd, no one came, it was very cold and on the 26th a few people came. When I was there for the 15th anniversary I’ve seen a lot of people. For the 15th anniversary even TV came. Someone even held a speech. Our people forget everything so quickly. Only yesterday a horrific event took place and today no one remembers that. Go on, eat. Lord have mercy. Let us pray to the Lord for peace from above and for the salvation of our souls. Lord have mercy. For the remission of sins in the blessed memory of the departed let us pray to the Lord let us pray to the Lord. Of the ever-memorable servants of God... Brothers and Sisters today is a memorial day of the Iveron icon of the Mother of God. This is a special for us united by the memory of the tragic events that took place here 17 years ago. Memory of the victims and hostages of a terrible terrorist act. An act that was designated to install fear in people And people who do these things think they serve God. Lord tells us "Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but who cannot kill the soul. Fear him who can plunge body and soul into The Fire Gehenna". Brothers and sisters. Fear is only a feeling it has no content. We were not afraid then, and we will not be afraid now. Today mother is here. Mother Natalia from the Voskresensky Goritsky monastery. Natalia was with us. The mother survived the tragedy, and lost her son. Today she will hold a memorial event in the theatre hall to which she asks us all to come. Brothers and sisters let’s remember those difficult days, so that the memory of loved ones never leaves us. Amen. So good that you came here. Thank you. 17 years ago we survived such events that we cannot forget. But... as time passes by everything is being erased. And a lot is being forgotten. Svetlana and I... to make it easier to restore the situation we bought inflatable mannequins. There are three colours. White ones are for... As we have decided they are victims who didn’t survive the attack. Black - for terrorists who were in the hall maybe some of them were near you. Blue - for those who couldn’t come today. For some reasons anyway, they were at first, total strangers. But they were your neighbours in the rows and you know something about them and can tell it now. So that we could also remember them. Some have already passed away over the last 17 years. When you want to say something... Take the mic. When you want to say something raise your hand and I’ll come to you with a mic. Now, Mother Natalia and I will give the mannequins that you need to inflate. Just to remind you - white is for the victims black - for terrorists blue - for those, who couldn’t come today for some reason. -I need a black one. -One second. -I need a blue one. -Blue one as well. -Here is a blue one. -I need two - blue and white. Blue one for me. Here are two of blue. Blue one as well. I can't even open it! Let me do that. -Which one for you? -Blue and white. -Thank you. -You're welcome. I need blue, for those who didn’t come. Two? How do I do that? This is valve there. Just hold it. How should I do that? Just hold it. That's it. My name is Ekaterina. I came on the 23rd to watch the musical together with my husband, ex-husband now, and niece. We were seating close to the stage. The second part of the musical it started at nine o'clock. Nine o’clock sharp. Five minutes later, a man in a camouflage, came out to the stage wearing a black mask, with a machine gun over his shoulder. Without a word, he fired some shots at the ceiling above the stage. A few light bulbs shattered, shards of glass fell down but the dancers continued to dance they haven’t stopped yet and musicians continued to play. More terrorists appeared in the aisle to the right. They also fired some shots and that’s when the music stopped. Dancers stopped. The gunman on the stage grabbed the closest artist dragged him to the edge of the stage and pushed him into the aisle. Other artists left the stage under the pointed guns of the terrorists. The audience took the first shots laughing as if it was a bad joke the shots were loud and everyone was wondering what would happen next. Gradually, more terrorists started to appear, there were girls in black with their faces covered with burqas. They didn't seem to wear explosive belts - they put it on later. Then they demanded that everyone put their hands behind their heads and everyone laughed. The idea that this is not a joke occurred as soon as music stopped. I felt my heart beat twice as fast. But after a moment I calmed down and told myself - "It can't be happening. It's a joke! Very stupid, but just a joke!" When they demanded again "Hands behind your head!" someone loudly shouted - "behind whose head?" But then the terrorist that was walking down the aisle. And then he hit that young guy, first with foot and then with gun. He hit the guy who either said something to him, or tried to stand up. The sight of blood running from the guy’s temple convinced me that it wasn’t just a joke. And then someone from the hostages said you need to put your hands on your head. And I said why? And they said it’s a terrorist attack, didn’t you understand? And I said - no, I didn’t. I said - ok and I put my hands on my head. But I didn’t understand anything. I didn’t think anything. After it all ended I was surprised by the reaction of people who were asking me if I was scared. I didn’t know what to tell them. I said - I think, from your point of view it looks different because I wasn’t scared. It was something... Not fear. It was something absolutely different. There were several layers of feelings. When you enter, and see that in one part of the hall some guys and girls are smiling, chatting. There were a lot of us who were rehearsing upstairs. And I was looking at them in the hall and saw that some of them started talking and laughing they were passing notes to each other. Asking "did you hear that?", making jokes. And I thought - look at that guy, he got around already. He’s already met a girl and they have their own thing going on. Other guys were just sitting like that. Then someone told me that my mum is here as well, on the third row. "Look. She's on third row." I looked down and I saw my mum looking on the balcony, to check if I’m there. And I waved at her - "hi". I was surprised to see her. I don’t know why I started talking about it now. I really don’t know. What were the terrorists’ demands? To withdraw the federal troops from Chechnya. I remember one in camouflage, he was some kind of press secretary. Others called him Aslanbek or Aslan. He was walking through the rows, communicating with the hostages. He told us to take our phones and call our families friends and television. So they would arrive here, to the theatre. I hid the phone. Then I pulled it out and called my friend. I said that I was held hostage. Asked her to call my daughter later. Then I called my daughter myself. I didn’t know how to tell her that... that her father and I, her sister and her nephew - all held hostages. That was so weird. I tried to hide what happened for a while but the daughter understood at once that there was something bad going on. Then they made everybody change their seats. Can I continue? I remember that women were told to sit on the right side and men on the left. They allowed us to stay with children. They allowed us to stay together. My son stayed with me. They allowed me to. And my husband managed to take the seat right by the aisle. So we ended up sitting not that far from each other and we could look at each other. And even talk occasionally. You know one of the terrorists that was on stage... I’ll come over to you now. One of the terrorists, that was on a stage he had spoken loudly about a withdrawal of troops from Chechnya. Everyone listened to him, the hall was quiet. And then he... he said that as long as there is no assault we were not in danger, but if the assault begins they would blow up the whole theatre. And for every terrorist killed, they would kill ten hostages. Someone from the audience shouted that the withdrawal of troops takes a long time to which one of the shahids who were sitting next to me replied that they were not in a hurry and were ready to stay for as long as necessary. Then Aslan came out on stage carrying a radio. He screamed: "Listen to your radio lying!". I didn’t hear what they said on the air but I assume they didn’t like it. Is there anyone today, who was sitting on the balcony? My daughter was moved to the balcony. When everyone was changing their seats we were in the toilet and when we returned the gunman, who accompanied a few girls sent us all to the balcony. Later, the terrorists spend a long time looking for the keys to the side doors of the balcony. They just lost them. Then they tried to barricade it with chairs and for this purpose began to break off one row. Aslan asked if anyone wanted to help them. One guy volunteered to break off the chairs, but Aslan told that it isn't necessary anymore. One shahid girl sat next to the door she had already put on the belt with explosives She was addressed as Ir or Ira, but I wasn't sure if that was her real name more like a nickname. Unlike other suicide bombers, she opened her face straight away so we called her "Gulchatai". She looked very young, an ordinary Caucasian girl who you can usually see on the street or at the market. She was always frowning, but it was kind of unnatural. She looked very, very nervous. Let’s talk about Romanova now. Maybe someone wants to talk about her? Let me talk about her. Ok. -Take the mic. -Thank you. My name is Victoria. Olga Romanova came in once they've already declared on TV about the siege. She somehow made it through the entire cordon, walked into the hall in the concert hall. And down the aisle to the stage. She came up to one of the terrorists, they pointed guns at her. She loudly demanded that they would immediately release all the hostages. They told her to raise her hands she didn't. She told them to let at least the women and the children out. Then gunman came close to her. Like extremely close. And told the others she was drunk. He gestured her to walk away. He demanded to take her out. They took her right here. Through the side door. All of us who were sitting here we saw how one of them pushed her in the back with the back of the gun. She was saying something, I think to keep their hands off. They hit her one more time and she... she just fell on the floor. Everyone who sat in our row saw that terrorist started shooting at her unloading the whole machine gun magazine at her. In the hall, everyone froze. Complete silence. As we realised that the first blood was shed. We took it from the buffet. Come here, take something to eat. You are probably hungry. -Come here. -Anyone? Sparkling water? -Should I give it to you? -Thank you. Surprisingly, no one was hungry for such a long time. Probably because of stress. Then when we got hungry the terrorists took out from buffet what they called "trophies". It was buffet food in the boxes. They asked the guys from the hostages to help them bring the boxes to the stage. The shahid girl, who was sitting behind us... yes, she was sitting right here told the guys from the group of actors to stand up and help. The guys were carrying boxes to the stage. There were two-litre packs of juice sparkling water, chocolate, chewing gum, candy the usual buffet food. Strange that they also brought melted ice cream. The militants loved to throw food from the stage into the hall. And also after all of this Then they put two chairs on the stage back to back and tied some packages with explosive to it. There was that screeching sound. That sound stayed with you. They were doing it in different places of the stage. Then they put a canister on top of it. There was a box with the wires under the chairs and they started connected the wires. Another gunman was hanging a flag on the stage it was some Arabic script on a black background. I afterwards saw the same flag hanging in the mezzanine. So... There was conflict between the terrorists and our electricians because our... The terrorists must have broken sound and light equipment. All the lights that were blinking went off. Before that, for two hours, light rays continued to fall on the stage Tell us about the suicide bomber girl, who was sitting near you. I remember only that her face was always covered. I never saw her eyes. I don't know her name but she was very calm. She was one of the few who talked to some of the hostages. Apparently she was still a child. Something like 15 or 16 years old. What did she say? She didn’t talk to us. I’ve just seen her talking to others. Katerina wants to add something. I remember her telling that her father and brother were killed in the war. She was saying that there was a war and we go to theatres here. And also something around the time they started handing out food they hung something from the balcony like a gas cylinder. Everyone started saying that it was a land mine. Same one was installed not far behind me in the stalls. Right behind guys. Another suicide bomber was sited there and the terrorists spend a long time connecting wires to that cylinder. You wanted to add something? I remember that when they were installing a land mine Aslan was going through the aisle and asked men whether anybody had any knowledge of mines. He asked men. He asked those who did to stand up. But no one did so he laughed and told them: "You are no men!". We then thought that he needed minesweepers to convince everyone that the bombs were real. I’m sorry but are you going to stay up long tonight? We agreed with the management that we will have the whole evening. I understand, but understand me. It's midnight already. I have to turn the lights off. But we... Wait a little. We are not done yet. -How much longer? -We should... Some more time. I understand. But I need to turn the lights off. - Give us some more time. - We agreed with the management. We will try to wrap up fast. Just put it back. Some water for you? Thank you. Just put it back, please. I will have to kick you out soon. You don’t have to kick us out. I have to lock everything. Galya! She came. I was struck by one of the terrorists looks. He was young, he looked like 18 years old. He finished just a few classes of school before leaving for the war. He loved picking up cell phones that were piled high in the aisle and studying them. He kept on asking about their brands. He just kept on approaching the hostages. He played games on those phones. The phones rang often on the first day they were ringing nonstop and then he answered he liked to talk to the hostages’ families in an arrogant tone. He distributed cell phones to some other terrorists so they called each other. Can you tell us about the toilet? Galya, don’t interrupt him, please. He was taking small groups of people to the toilets, where he passed them to other terrorists. To go to the toilet you had to stand in the queue by the wall in the side aisle. And you had to wait. They were taking us to the toilet. First they took men to the men's toilet, and then they arranged the toilet right in the room next to the hall. There was some kind of an office. They even moved tables, they made toilets right there. They even sprinkled bleach in room, so there was no strong smell. Tell us more about the toilet. Please continue. Women were taken to the ladies room by the balcony. That day two women escaped from the toilet. And the terrorists said - that’s it from now on you will go to the toilet in the orchestra pit. They also said that if anyone escapes they will kill ten hostages for each one who escaped. However, when those two women escaped they haven’t killed anyone. Thank you. It became so quiet at some point that we dozed off. We calmed down. And for the first time we dozed off. Then we woke up because everyone was screaming and then I was told that some man hit the shahid girl in the head with the bottle and then ran in the aisle. The shahid girl started shooting at him. But she missed him and instead shot a young woman who was sitting next to the aisle. She was wounded in her stomach. Badly. And she just fell and everybody saw that... Please, continue. Everyone saw how another terrorist fired a machine gun and shot that man. And that girl, she was my niece. And... And I... I couldn’t help her at all. You are leaving, Katerina? Wait! Just wait a little bit. Good bye! And then terrorists... I’ll come to you. And then the terrorists told everyone to return the glass bottles and they put them back in the boxes. I was backstage when... the attack happened and then I hid in the dressing room. I sat there for quite a while. I was lucky. There is one moment that still stays rather mystical for me. Only I know about that. It’s only my psyche, my memory. No one has ever talked about that particular moment. And when we were discussing it no one has ever talked about that particular moment. I was sitting under the table in the dressing room. I was sitting there with my parents. At some point I started realising that something bad something unexplainable is happening. But I wasn’t afraid. I was just observing. I was in a state of "here and now". When they say "to be here and now", it’s exactly that moment when you are not reflecting on anything you just exist in "that moment", under the table. Because nothing else exists in that moment. While sitting under the table I was thinking that maybe a batman or whichever superhero will come now and it will be over. And in that very moment I’ve heard a voice of a Russian man, I’m not sure whether he was real or not Speaking about memory that somehow stayed in my memory. I’ve heard that voice. He shouted: "raise your hands up". Maybe it was a Russian soldier or a kamikaze hostage from the hall. A gun was fired then and we’ve heard... Actually, not we, I'm not sure about the others - I’ve heard a sound of a body falling to the floor. And at that very moment it hit me. Something happened at this moment. It became obvious to me that a superhero won’t... That he won’t come to save us. Because the man whose voice I’ve heard is dead. That’s it. That’s it. Let’s wrap up here. Why you are looking at me like that? Am I not clear? Who is in charge here? You? Mother signed all the papers. Have some decency. Take your people and leave. We are almost done. Without "almost". Without "almost". It’s time for you to leave. Collect your stuff from the cloakroom and leave. What’s the point of sitting here? Let’s stay for a bit and go till the end. Don’t leave. We will go till the end. Natasha, I’m not sure. Go till what end? I think you are totally detached from the reality. Why sit here, digging into details? The underground is closing soon. I’m done here. Guys. Good bye. We need to talk it through at least once. At least once to go through till the end. We can’t just leave. I understand it’s not easy it’s painful. I understand that. But we need to find strength in us to do that. We should do this work. Otherwise, we will keep dragging all our mistakes along us. And because of that it can happen again. And people will suffer again. Jesus, nothing has changed. Natasha, what are you doing there? Sveta, come help me here. We have to block it. So that they won’t disturb us. We have to close doors. That's it! Let’s do it for our loved ones. We did love them, didn’t we? Why "did"? We still love them. We will do it for them. We will need large wooden planks. You're right. We will find something. We are sitting here, saying nothing. Here we go. Every time a disaster happens to us we just sit and say nothing. That’s why they follow us. One disaster after another. That’s because we say nothing. Because we are too scared to say something. Like we are dead. Pinned down by our fears. Why are you sitting? Come over. I won’t let you out anyway. Stop being scared. Everyone, come here, help us. It’s our life and we will live it minute by minute today. Why they keep interrupting us? How we can help? Take care of that door. You need to block it. Just block these two doors. To block with what? Find something. Let’s move this fridge to the door. We're blocking it! Use these planks to block the door. Come back for more. What circus you are creating here? Why did you block the doors? What the fuck are you doing here? What the fuck is happening? What in the actual... Get up and leave now. Why you are looking at me? Stand up and leave. -No. -What? We need a couple hours more. Are you out of your fucking mind? We need to stay here for a while. Please, wait. What do you mean "wait"? I’m going to call the police now. Is that clear? Listen, we haven’t done anything wrong. You listen to me. If I say it’s over it means "it’s over". We will leave in a couple of hours. - No more hours! - We will clean everything. You are out of your fucking mind. Be quiet. There was a woman sitting in front of me. She had an icon... An icon of Matrona of Moscow. She was passing it through the rows so people could pray. Another person wrote "Our Father" prayer on a piece of paper and passed it through the rows as well. I remember there were Russian people sitting next to me. They were also praying. I slid down to the floor and started praying. "Our Father". I didn’t know any other prayer back then. We also prayed. Then someone behind Anya started crying. A shahid girl who was sitting next to us she finished her prayer. She kept her eyes shut. And told us, whispered: "Pray, pray". Just pray. And at one point one of shahid girls started saying something loudly Girl next to me told afterwards that shahid girl said if they start the assault we will all die and that’s how we will get into heaven. I came here and saw that the doors are blocked. They blocked it with a plank and a hose. What am I supposed to do? Stand up and leave immediately. I repeat - stand up and get out of here now. Pointless. Hey you, nun. Stand up now and open the door. You don’t understand when I talk normally to you! Got it. We will talk differently then. Where is police? On its way. Switch off the lights. Let them sit in the dark. I don’t have the keys. Find it then! Later there was a fire in the orchestra pit. A fire. Why did it start? Anyone remembers the details? Here you go. Thank you. We used the orchestra pit as a toilet short circuit happened there and the fire started. Everyone had to use the orchestra pit as a toilet after two women escaped it was forbidden to leave the hall. They demanded to use orchestra pit. Who were those two women? Anyone knows? I don’t know. I haven’t seen them either. I was one of those two women. When I could no longer hold it, I asked to go to the toilet. I took place in the queue to the toilet by the aisle. My kids have already gone and I haven't. I kept exchanging glances with them. It was my turn. Me and another woman we were taken to the bathroom. One of the terrorists sat by the toilet and he listened carefully to the radio. He didn't pay attention to us. When we went inside there was one more woman. She was with a child, with boy. They were drinking water from the tap. And then I went into the closet and heard that Olga that was her name the one who came with me asking the woman with the child to close the door behind her when she was going to leave. I got out of the closet, went to sink to get some water, too. And I saw Olga opening the window. I asked her what she thinks she is doing. But Olga had already jumped out of the window. Continue, Natasha. I looked down and I shouted at her she was on the visor "What have you done?" "You will be shot". From the window. And if I don’t come back with her I'd be shot, too. And she quietly told me not to scream. Just jump. And I jumped. I immediately felt pain, I’ve broken my legs. And when I was crawling on that visor, I thought what have I done and how I can go back. But I couldn't go back anymore. It was not possible to go back. It was not possible. I made a mistake. And... I can’t fix it. I can’t. Open the door. Switch on the lights. All of you will have to go with me to the police station now. Here she is! She organised all of that. Please don’t, stop. - It’s a memorial evening. - Stand up, all, stand up - We did nothing wrong. - Stand up, all, stand up Take her with you. Look, they have damaged the whole stage. We will deal with that. You are coming with us. Don’t take her. Samokhina? Yes, it’s me. Natalia Mikhailovna start writing your statement, I’ve already asked you once. Father Andrei Father Andrei blessed me. Blessed you to do what? Everything. He blessed you to take hostages? I didn’t take anyone hostage. They decided to stay. By their own free will. He blessed you to trash the hall? Not the hall, the stage. He blessed you to wreck the stage? Start writing your statement, I won’t do it for you. I don’t want to press charges anymore. I changed my mind. Sveta. Everything ok? Yes, they let us go. Goodbye. See you. Goodbye. Sveta. Why didn’t you tell anything? When? At the memorial evening. You didn’t say a word. You surely have something to say. I didn’t want to. Why? Those who talked were not enough for you? Wait! Do you remember how the assault started? Let’s sleep. We had a tough day. Do you remember that? I do. It was almost morning, I wanted to sleep until 8 a.m. but woke up around 4 a.m. One of the gunmen started shooting at the ceiling. Many were frightened and they also started waking up. And then what? There was a sound like someone was running on the roof or the attic. They were saying, gas was without any colour or smell... On television... Is it true? There was a strong smell. And there was something like a fog near the vents. Did the gas put you to sleep? Not immediately. I remember how I wanted to move my arm, my leg. I wanted to hug Lena and hide under the chair with her. But I realised I couldn’t do anything. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t feel my body. And then it was like a dream. I saw that the wall fell on the stage. Our people had come in and started shooting the terrorists. And then? Then what? I don't remember anything after that. I woke up in the hospital. They told me straight away that my husband and daughter died. I know that. If you know that then why you started asking me about that? You wanted me to tell you all of that again? To tell you again that... To tell you how my husband and my daughter died right in front of my eyes. Why? Why you organised that memorial evening? Why you were asking everyone? Why? Because we must remember. We can’t forget our loved ones. Our children have to remember. We don’t have to remember anything. People don’t want to remember. With all the baggage they have inside, they want to live on with it. They want to make new families, raise new kids. We must remember. You came here like it’s a vacation for you. From your monastery. Where it’s calm and peaceful. Where no one can touch you. You have your own god there. And here people are afraid to go outside. They are afraid of going into the underground. I’ve never been to any stage play or any concert since then. And I will never go again. Never! I’m scared. Fear... Fear... Fear is our strongest sin. Fear. Good night. Let’s sleep. I thought we were going to have some tea. Just talk. Do you want some vodka? It's ok, it's ok. When do you stop torturing us? When do you stop coming here to remind us about that? When will you finish praying for your redemption? Never. Never? I can’t earn redemption. You can. It’s impossible to earn redemption for what I’ve done. It is possible. Mum, can I show grandma my dog? Go to your room! Do not stick your face out of it! Shut up! You’re drunk. You can’t talk to a child like that. It’s my house and I can do whatever I want here. It is clear to you? I see you are a sober one. Go wash your dirty mouth! Do you hear me? You are a monster. Hey, you. Fucking nun. Get out of here! Get the hell out of here! I will not leave. Get the hell out! Don’t forget it's my house too. Get the hell out of it. Get the hell out of it. Get the hell out of it. You won’t make me leave. It’s my own house, it’s not clear to you? You have nothing here. It was given to me and your father. To us. Oleg, tell her. This house was given to us. Do you hear that? Even your father is saying it! You weren’t even born when we were already living here. I wish you were dead. Die! Die! Die! Die! Are you going by the evening train? I hope to catch the afternoon one. Are you going to pass by Galya's place? No. What should I tell her if she asks? Nothing. Do you want to stay? I do. I do. But you can’t? I can't. I’ve just understood that I came here for the wrong reason. I prayed for the wrong things. I was asking for the wrong things. All this time. I realised my mistake only now. Fear. I am full of fear. How can I get rid of it? I don’t know. YEGOR SAMOKHIN 12.02.1989 - 26.10.2002 Ambulance! Quiet. Are you the relatives? Going with? - Yes. - Yes. Insurance, Passport.
