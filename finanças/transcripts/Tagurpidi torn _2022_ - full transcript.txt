It was our secret. No one was supposed to know. We meant no harm. But somehow it turned out that way. Why didn't we seek help right away? I don't know. We didn't dare. But I had a feeling, that I must do something. But the witch saw him stealing. She got mad and started yelling: For that I'll keep your firstborn! The frightened man agreed. And when his wife gave birth to a girl... Close your eyes. And when his wife gave birth to a girl, he took her to the witch, who named her Rapunzel. As the years passed, she got more beautiful. Everyone admired her, especially her long golden hair. The witch became jealous. To keep anyone from stealing her, she locked her in a tower. One could only enter through a window high up. To enter, the witch called out: "Rapunzel, let your hair down, so that I could come up to you." One day a prince riding by, saw Rapunzel in the tower window, and fell in love with her. THE SLEEPING BEAST Kristjan! Ariel! I saw you, Ariel! - I scared you. - No, you didn't. It doesn't matter, let's go up! I saw you too, Mia-Margot! The prince is escaping the zombies, but the spirit is leading the way. - We need something bigger. - I can be the spirit. No, you're the princess, you have the nicest clothes. - Be a princess yourself. - I'll be offering magic potions. Potions, that make you jump really high, and escape The Spirit of Death. Who wants some? It'll make you invisible. - There's an earthworm inside. - Drink it yourself! - Your turn, Mia-Margot! - So tasty. Put it on. Three... Wait, wait. You lose! This board belongs to The Spirit of Death. One wrong move, and you'll be stuck with The Spirit of Death. Don't take that, it could break. Don't teach all the time. Don't touch that. Siim, do you want my old bow? Fix it, I don't want it. Your old broken bow? What do I do with it? Okay. Hey, check this out! - Who's foot touches the floor... - Gets taken by The Spirit of Death. - You're The Soul of a Lost Knight, right? - Yes. I drink the blood of girls. I'll suck all the blood out of you. You're such a fool! The Soul of a Lost Knight is not a vampire! Siim, if you fall, you fall to the Spirit of Death. He'll grab your leg and yank it! - You're dead! - That doesn't count! Did you hear that? - That might be them. - Who? The witch? No, the one! The Spirit of Death! Loore! Elmar! Are you here? What a great guard you are... Should have gotten a watchdog. Siim, show me the beetle. - Thank you. - Give it back! Who lost the battle? Loore! Loore! Hey, Karmo! What are you doing? What's it to you? Mom was looking for you. Why? Loore! Come on! Crank it up! Crank it up! That's for you. Mom said if I don't look after Lisandra, she will send me to my father. My dad has a new wife. She's weird. I don't want to go there. Stop bouncing the ball! Nothing better to do? Loore! I'll think of something. Kristjan! - Okay. - One more time! - One more! - Okay. That's it. - Once more. - No. - One last time. - No. Good night. - Turn off the light. - One second. - Hello! - Hello. Do you understand? "The presence of children on the territory of the complex is strictly forbidden. Private property." You can't go there. Is that clear? Ariel, let's go. Your hair is a mess. Owner Teet Raspel. - Beet. - Rascal. - Well, what's that? - What? - We can't go inside. - We get it, stupid. - Whose home is it? - It's the princess' castle. She's been asleep for 100 years. Well, big man, can you open it? Wait! Remember, there's a hole in the fence? - Maybe they've left it open. - If yes, we can enter through it. - It will be legal. - Let's go! I think so. Come on! In and out. Lisandra, let's go. Come on, let's go. - Come on Siim, you brave zombie! - You can't get away! Well, zombie! Do you want to fight? Don't fool around! This is a serious fight! Are you hurt? Are you okay? Let's keep playing. - I don't want to. - I accidentally. I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. Lisandra! You could have fallen in! I can't keep an eye on her here, we're going down. Why do we have to carry this baby around? Pointless baby! - Lisandra! - Let's go out! What are you doing here? You can't be here anymore. It was allowed all the time! Why not now? Children, listen to me! - I want to pee! - Leave! You can't be here. This place is not for kids! Go away! Up! Hurry! Catch us if you can! Why don't you understand? Don't move! Leave this place! If he's asks you to let your hair down, don't do it. I'm not stupid! - You can't be here! - Run! - Come, run, run! - Faster! I don't want to see you here again! Come on now, come! - Dads are here! Dads are home! - Dad! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy's home, run. Daddy! - You're fooling around, yeah? - No. I'll get you some food. I won't be digging coal tomorrow. Me and the guys are going to a rally. - Can I come? - The car is full. Who's going? Siim's, Mia-Margot's and Lisandra's dad, me and Karmo. Who knows, maybe Karmo will also become a rally star one day. Let's eat. Go buy some candy. - I've got shitload of candy. - What? - You heard that? - Yes. Take him with you sometimes. He's not a baby anymore. I can see that. He's becoming a thug. With alcohol. - What's that? - A gift from dad. Goddammit! There should be a mark on the ignition. - And on the crankcase. - Shut up, wise guy. Have you tried to align the lines? - Go play with your dolls. - You're the one playing with dolls. Hey, kid! Here, take the wrench. Get lost. He orders too little. Two bags per square meter should be fine. He doesn't know anything about construction. You need a lot more for 200 square meters. But who should I explain this to? PÃ¤ivi? Go get some sausages for us. - Go, Siim. - I don't want to. Why not? Are you scared of your dad? - I'm not hungry. - Of course you're scared. Scared, cause your dad kicks your ass. I'll go myself. Here's some sausages. Split them evenly. Take it, I'm not a cannibal. Thank you. - And you stop doddering. - I'm not doddering. - What? - I'm not doddering! Then act like a man! Not like a faggot! - Take this! - I don't want to. Take it. - Is there more? - No more meat. Stop it. "The presence of children in the industrial complex is strictly prohibited." Stop pulling so hard, it hurts! You have to braid hard for curls. I said stop it! - Then braid it yourself. - No. I was thinking about autumn... ...but only if we... ...grow your hair. And they're going to get really long. And if you behave well... ...then... ...maybe... ...you won't have to... Play the piano anymore? Yes, yes! Mommy! But starting from autumn. Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the cutest of them all? Damn, it's crackling! Hey, come down! Karmo, get in the car. Wait, I'll bring Karmo's trousers. Wow, look who's alive! The Oaf! Speed up, stutter! - Go on! - Hey, I wanted to tell you... Please listen to me, or I'll have to call the police on the children. What? They're still running around there. In the ruins. - They were there again? - Yes. Where did you think they'd be? This man is a guard there? What? He's a pervert. Everybody knows that. Remember when, years ago, child's remains were found from the school boiler ash? - Wait, they found... - Police came to investigate. They found schoolbag's buckles there. Who knows. Anyway, the child was never found. - I don't remember anyone going missing. - Nobody did. And our children are playing there... Wait a second. Mia-Margot! It's horrible! Stop it, it's an old wives' tale. If he was guilty, he would've been in prison. He's just a drunk. Not all criminals get punished. Psychopaths know how to cover their tracks. In any case, they're not allowed there. And we need to tell Siim's mother about this. I can talk to her. If she's in the condition for it. Right now they're here. I'll drive to the city for a few hours. - Want to join? - Yes. Wow, surfers! - We're professionals. - Hey, you! Come down before someone falls head first. We're bored. Play with your smartphones or something. Loore, take Lisandra, I'll drop my cake off to the town. That Oaf has some nerve to tell on us like that. That drunk ruins everything. He locked his children in the basement. Something heavy could fall on this drunk's head. He would definitely leave the place after. The drunk. Mom has all sorts of bottles here. They're gifted, but nobody ever drinks Do you really think he would let us in for some alcohol? We'll add sleeping pills, he'll be asleep. I don't think we have any sleeping pills. This is our new couch. Let's go now! Come on! Let's go! The door is locked! Does anyone have a rope? Let's go play! I can't get it off! - Kristjan, come down! - Come down! He's coming! Kristjan! Kristjan, come! What is he doing? Mean wizard is gone! Let's go play! Where is it? Why didn't you put it in the bag? Rapunzel wouldn't have fit. Why didn't you pack the book? I can't do everything! - Where did you get this? - I gave it to her. Come with me. Siim, move. Let's play that she's asleep. We should tie her down, then we would have time to play. - What should we use? - I don't want to. If you don't fall asleep, a giant monster will come out of the monster cave and lick you with his slobbery tongue! You're gross. Let's pretend you're the Sleeping Beauty. - Rapunzel! - Rapunzel... But Rapunzel wanted to sleep in her tower, she didn't want to hear the wizard saying: Rapunzel, let down your hair. So she kept her eyes closed. She went to sleep again. Closed her eyes. Siim, let it down further. Loore, now! OK, done! Ariel, let the curtain down. Okay, more. Done. Siim, bring some more plastic! I died from sorrow. Nobody loved me. To bring her back, we need to rescue her from the underworld. - You didn't want to save me? - There's nothing to save. - Let's feed her to the Spirit of Death. - Ha-ha! Very funny! Found it! Found it! Found it! The Beast will be very angry! Come here! - Don't run anywhere! - The guard! Come here, girl. Come, talk to me. I mean no harm. Leave her alone! You're disgusting drunk! I'm not going anywhere! You're really disgusting! - Run! - Run from him! - Run from him! - I'm going to get you! Lisandra! Lisandra! Lisandra! - Lisandra! - What is it? - She's not here! - Stupid baby! - Lisandra! - Lisandra! - Lisandra! - She's nowhere to be found! She's nowhere to be found! What do I do? How can I go home? What will I tell mom? You go to the back! Ariel and Siim, check here! - What about the guard? - Never mind him! Everything will be okay! I'll go to the basement! Meet me soon! - Lisandra! - Lisandra! Lisandra. Damn. Where are you? Bunch of brats! It's no place for children. I can't find her anywhere. Neither can we. What am I going to tell mom? Maybe she woke up and went home? Ouch! My foot! - What happened? - Nothing. Lisandra! Lisandra! Lisandra. Where are you going? - What's wrong? - Nothing. What happened to your foot? - I fell. - Jesus. We have to clean it! Sit down. - I have to go. - Sit, calm down. Sit down! - Ouch! - Stop playing the victim. Where's Lisandra? Lisandra! Did you leave her out alone? - No... - So, where is she? Look at me! You can't leave your sister alone! - No... - Stop it! If you won't stop running around, you know, where you'll be going. And I mean it. I am getting tired of this. Go bring your sister inside! - She's not at home! - Darn it! Let's go back there! Loore! Loore! Hello? Loore! Hello? Rapunzel, hello? - Where should we be looking? - We're getting our butts whooped. - Shut up! - Loore! What are you yelling for? Wipe your nose. Want some water? Stop screaming! Loore! Loore! - Don't want! - Don't want... Loore! What am I supposed to do with you? - Loore! - Stay here! Loore! - What are you banging for? - Let Lisandra go! The child would have been killed, if she had fallen into the pit! Lisandra, we're here! Come back with your mother! We'll talk! There's nothing to talk about, you fool! What? Damn! Loore! - Stupid monkeys! - Let's go! - Damn! - Loore! Catch us if you can! - You brats! - Side doors! Brats! Here you are, you brats! - Kristjan! - Leave him alone! You! Help me! I'm sorry. What? See, he's alive. What are you staring at! Help me out of here! - What about Lisandra? - Lisandra! - Where are you fools going? - One second. Hey! Lisandra! Lisandra! Sweetie, let's wipe it all off. - Rapunzel? - Let's go already! Rapunzel fell into the pit. - We're in a hurry. - What about the guard? - Let's go now. - There's going to be trouble. You fool, who are you calling? - But the guard is... - In the dungeon with Rapunzel. We'll take care of him. He's going to be fine. And later we'll see, okay? If he promises not to say a word. Well? Wait. We need to promise, that this is going to stay between us. I promise. I promise. - Me too. - I promise. - I promise. - Your turn. Kristjan? - I promise. - Look at me and repeat it. I promise. Let's go now. What's the problem? I'm home Friday afternoon, and leave on Sunday afternoon. Every week! Yes, but then there's the rally... No, the rally isn't every Saturday. Honey, when was the last time we did something together? Hey, boys! Are you coming to see me off tomorrow? I have to get back to Finland. We could spend some time in the city. Okay. I can't go tomorrow. - What's so important? - There's this one thing. Okay, Karmo, but you can. Wake up early, okay? - Yes. Good night. - Good night. Are you still mad about the rally? I was grounded for six months, because of the car incident. I couldn't go anywhere. So stop sulking. I'm not sulking. Help! Help! You know what? My mom scolded me, for not taking Lisandra straight home. It was horrible. Now I'll definitely be sent to my dad's. You think so? Maybe not? - I'm thinking about the guard. - The guard can wait. Think, how to get the doll out of that pit. But... Figure something out. Please. Lisandra won't stop screaming. She wants her doll. I gave her my old ones, but she wants that one. We have to get it out. Or she will tell to mom. Your crown, princess. I'm tired of playing a random princess. I'm going to be Lara. - Who? - Lara Croft, a warrior. You'll think of something, yes? Right, Kristjan? Here's your crown, princess. Help! Help! Where were you? You didn't call for help? Or you will leave me in this pit forever? If we get you out of here, can you promise us something? What? What do I have to promise? That you won't tell anyone. - I won't! - You're lying! I'm not lying! Throw me a rope! Prove it! We'll get you out, if you'll give us something. We'll pull you out if you give us Rapunzel. Ah! - This one? - Throw it to me! Only if you'll... ...if you'll give me a rope, or something. Throw it first! - You have to promise to help me out! - Give me the rope. - Do you want to get out or not? - Yes. You can climb up along it. But only if you promise you won't tell a soul. Oh, witch, let Rapunzel go! - You promise? - You have my word! Can I trust you? - Yes. - You promise? - Throw the doll! - You promise? - Throw the doll! - You swear? Throw it! - Throw the doll! - Throw it already! Throw the doll! Throw it! Yes! The rope! Now the rope! Let's go now! Faster! - A little more. - Climb. - Okay. - Start climbing! - Okay. - Climb! Okay. What? Are you kidding me? He promised not to tell anyone. He has told on us. He's going to do it again. It's his job. You can't trust grownups. He won't let us back here anymore. You promised! You promised! You gave your word! - We'll see tomorrow. - Tomorrow? Be reasonable. What are you doing? Stop it! The Spirit of Death is now trapped forever. He can't eat people, it makes his stomach ache. And then he won't be able to scream! - Look what I found! - You can give it to him to eat. But if we only feed our lion with grass for a whole week, he won't die, but will be hungry enough to eat anything we'll throw down there. Oh, come on! He's not a lion. How long will he survive in that pit? But we feed him these leaves... Have a great dinner, lion! What's this? Ariel? Since my skirt is torn, could I wear sweatpants tomorrow? Ariel, don't start with this again. It's inappropriate for a girl to run around like a savage. You don't go to the ruins with others, do you? - It doesn't matter. - Jesus! But that man... That guard is a pervert! You have to stay away from there! - And from that man as well, okay? - What did he do? Dying of thirst. No matches. - Add some beans as well. - Okay. Done. What are you doing? Let's add some salt as well. - Stop it! That's too much! - Let it be! - What are you doing? Stop it! - Some ketchup as well. What are you doing? These are... Come on, these are raw! What are you doing? No, not this. Cat food as well. Some mustard. Get out of the way or you'll get hit! Are you deaf? Let him eat. - He lives in his crapper. - Eat your poop! Do you have a can opener? We can't give you cutlery, you're going to kill us. - How is he going to kill us? - I don't know. The strawberries were for him! I won't eat all of them, there'll be plenty for him. Eat your poop! Eat your poop! Lisandra! Let's pretend that you're a hungry monster and want to drag us into your pit! Did you hear? You're a hungry monster! They rode on horses... Well done. If someone falls in, he'll be forever stuck in monster's pit. - You need to be more scary. - Are you a faggot? Jump! Catch it! Jump! Jump! Catch it! Jump! Catch it! Let it go, you bastard! Let it go! Let it go, you bastard! Let it go! Let it go! Look at what you did! You're such a bastard! Look at what you did! - I'll look for something to help him. - No! You promised! We all did. We didn't promise not to help, we promised we wouldn't talk. It's all the same. Think of others. Think about what happens to Siim, if his parents find out. And Loore. She'll have to leave because of you. Maybe forever. Please. Flap it around. Give me the crown. I am the war princess, and I conquered this kingdom. - Isn't that right, Mia-Margot? - Yes. - Come on princess. Prince to the rescue! - Go, catch them! You can't go anywhere! I know where. Yoo-hoo? Never mind. I have to talk to you. Privately. Hey, about the guard. We can't leave him there. Kristjan, please don't start. Loore, please! You have to help me! Everything is fine as long as you don't tell anyone. But the guard is dying because of us! - Loore! - Give me the crown. Here's your crown, princess. - How does it fit me? - Very fashionable. - So cool. - The right war princess. What are you waiting for? Find something for yourself too... Where are you? What are you thinking? You need to change your weapon. It's useless. They come from the side. Shoot! Thank you, yeah... You seem exhausted. There's no point in playing. Pointless. - Are you stupid? - Loore! - Lisandra, what are you doing? - Feeding the man. - What man? - The one in the monster's pit. What are you talking about, sweetie? - I'll feed her myself. - What man? Have you scared her again with your monster stories? Stop scaring your little sister! Do you hear me? And clean this pillow. Right now! You can't tell anyone about this uncle. Or I won't take you with me anymore. Never again! If you don't take me with you, I'll talk. Shut up! And I want the princess crown to be mine. Ouch! Why are you hitting me? Don't you know you shouldn't hit girls? Come on, get up and start jumping, you damned pervert. - You need to... - Jump, jump. ...get me help. I can't take it anymore. Are you crazy? You were fine yesterday. He's faking, so that we'd feel bad. Don't you see? He can't do it anymore. Serves the pervert right. Think about what he would've done to us. What then? Maybe you're also a pervert, doing pervert things. - Perversities. - Exactly. That's why you feel sorry for him. - Let's do something fun! - Yes! Young man! Kristjan, right? You're a good boy. My name is Elmar. Please feed my dog. - He's starving. - Kristjan! - Brown house. - Come on, now! Near the cemetery. Please. - Why does it stink so bad here? - Eww. Human bones. - He's killed someone here. - Oh, come on! What? He's drawn us! - Eww, disgusting! - Freaky pervert. Someone's coming! Hey, Elmar! Answer it! We got lucky. What a bastard! What did I tell you? He's a pervert! We have to keep doing what we do. Doggy. I brought you some food. Here you go. What's your name? I can bring more. I thought you already fixed it. Yeah, "fixed"... When I'm done with school, and go to work in Finland with dad, I'll buy myself a decent motorbike with the money I earn. Kawasaki or something. Karmo, let's say I know somebody who's in trouble. But saving him would get me in a lot of trouble. What would you do? Is it one of your games again? - No, I was just thinking. - I'm not in the mood for this. Look, mom prepared some food, go home. Wait. I was just wondering where you are. Leave the pan alone. I'll give you some. You don't go to the ruins anymore, do you? - Do you? - We don't. Please make sure you won't orchestrate anything. We've had enough of Karmo's trouble last summer. You're my good boy. The gates are now locked. Yes, but the guard is missing. The Rescue Board is looking for him. Missing, how? The owner said he hasn't seen him for days. He wasn't at home either. This old man has no relatives or anyone. His mother died recently. He's coming! - What is it? - What did you tell Karmo? Am I not allowed to talk to my brother? We know that you want to save the guard! - But he's a pervert! - He's not a pervert! Kristjan, it's been proven. - We promised, remember? - But I didn't tell him anything! Interesting, what did I hear then? I just asked him what if, but I didn't tell him anything! If you can't keep your mouth shut, you won't have a life anymore. Ever. Not even at school. - Hi, children! - Hello! We're going to tell everyone how you defended that pervert. And you won't have any friends. Even your brother won't be your friend. They've never been friends. About a thousand times more, you've waited for a long time. The tea is getting cold, and strawberries are on the table. A few more moments, because the prince must be precise. A few more moments, and the fairytale can begin. Rapunzel is waiting for love, he's coming with an armful of roses. Rapunzel, let down your hair, for your lover to get up there. Rapunzel is waiting for love, he comes with an armful of roses. Hey, you! Kristjan, Kristjan! But you have to promise to remove it later! Otherwise they'll find out! Yes, don't worry. I'll take it away. Couldn't you find anything better? - I couldn't do anything! - It's okay. It's okay. You go! Don't worry. I'll put it away. I'll be fine. You go! - Get up, you pervert! - Jesus, he's dead! He's not dead, just sleeping. See? He's alive. Where did you get that? Where did you get the ladder? Who brought it? - You brought the ladder. - He's hurt. And who's fault is that? Why didn't you do as we agreed? You made things worse. You promised! I promised and I'm going to get help. No! Think about what they'll do to us! Maybe you want to go to the pit yourself? Yes, let's throw this faggot in as well. They'll start looking for him sooner or later. And they're going to find him. Kristjan's bow is in the pit, I wonder how it got there? Go and tell on us now! - It's your fault, that he's there. - What do you mean? It was your idea to bring him alcohol. And you provoked him to chase us. And you led him to the pit. Siim, did you see that he led him to the pit? - I got that impression, yes. - Got it? Siim also saw. Loore, you also saw, right? - I was with Lisandra. - I saw it. Mia-Margot? Kristjan is the one responsible, right? Of course. You see? Mia-Margot also witnessed it. Let's go to the castle. Kris... Kristjan... Take care of my dog. Hey, I brought you food and medicine. You take what you need from here. Sandwiches. I visited your dog. He's okay. Why are you whimpering? Fall asleep. Hey, Karmo. When they took you to the police last summer, what did they do to you? You're in trouble? No. Think about our mom. Testing megaphone. Let's gather in front of the building. Here you'll get the reflective vests and after that we can start heading towards the industrial complex. - Maybe they'll get choppers as well. - They won't see anything from the air. You think so? What? - Where is she going? - I don't know. I'll hold a quick briefing. We'll be searching the ruins... Where are you going, Mia-Margot? - To visit my grandmother. - Why? Her dad is coming this weekend. I'll have a vacation soon, but she wants to see grandma. - Did you get into a fight? - No. Okay, bye! Traitor! Before we start sweeping the area, I would like to stress... Have you seen my reflective vest? You're also going? Yes, I am participating as a volunteer. We have to do something. He could still be alive. He is going to be found, right? Hopefully before it's too late. You're going to stay home, and not going anywhere, okay? I don't want to worry about you right now. - It's already too much for me. - Okay. You have to come someplace with me! Karmo, please! It's important! Once in a lifetime, believe me! - What's wrong with you? - Please! Let's go fast! Let me. Let me try. I don't know. Take the helmet. Come on! - What? - Let's go! Let's go. Faster. Let's go. What are we here for? What's this? I don't get it. Did you bring Karmo to play with us? - What? - Ignore them. Karmo, would you be a brave prince? Please! Bring your friends as well. I'm not here to play your childish games. I was about to go swimming. - Wait! - You'll stay here. - Why did you bring Karmo? - What does he know? It's none of your business! We don't have our stuff here anymore. We're taking all of our stuff away. And you know whose stuff will be found? Yours. Is he still down there? What did you do to him? Let me through! Is he alive? Look! Come on! Kristjan, remember, three against one. No one's going to believe you. You'll go to prison! Children's prison! Seriously. Hey! Hey! What are you doing here? Go home, right now! - I want to talk to the chief. - What chief? Don't mind him. He just wants attention. He doesn't have any friends. And he has lost his bow. Beat it! I don't have time for you! We wanted to help... What were you thinking? I'm sorry. Poor guard. I wish that the guard was found and the offender would be punished. What offender? Someone has to be responsible. What are you talking about, children? It's nice that you wanted to help, but you help more by staying at home. - Go home now. - Mom, can I come with you? It's going to get dark soon. Get out. - Bye! - Bye! Wait a second. - What is it? - Wait. Come with me. I want to talk to you. - Can't we talk here? - We'll be seen. Come. - What is it? - Come. My mom told me to bring her a basin from here. That's what you wanted to tell me? No, there was something else as well. About the guard. - But help me find that first. - Okay. Can you give me your phone? I'll ask mom where it is. Where is it? Loore! - You can't betray us! - The guard is going to die! - Open the door! - Sorry! - Loore! Let me out! - Ariel! Siim! Damn it! Damn it! Look to the left and right, look through the area. Rapunzel is waiting for love... Lisandra! Lisandra, come here! Come here, to the door! You have to get me out of here! - I can't, the door is closed. - I know! Open the latch. I'd better go home. Lisandra! Lisandra. Hey, maybe you'd like to play a game? What are we playing? Would you like to be a prince? - But I'm a girl! - Yes, okay, a girl. You'll be a princess. I'll also be a princess and I'm in prison, you're saving me. - But you're a boy! - Yes, I'm a boy. I'll be the prince. You'll be the princess, and get me out of prison. - Do I get a crown? - Yes, of course. Open the latch. Open it! Where are you going? He's in the shed. - Stop, you fool! - How did he get out? I don't have a weapon. Let's just talk to him. What are you waiting for, you fools? Don't go through the bushes! The road is faster! Loore! - Stop it! - Shoot! - What are you doing? Shoot! - I can't, he's moving! - Shoot! - Ouch! Stop it! - He's getting away! Let's go! - My sword is missing! He's getting away! Run, run! I saw something. Get him! Is anyone here? Anyone? Is anyone here? Is anyone here? - You can't tell on us! - They're all gone! Damn, he got away! - He couldn't get far, he was limping. - Well where did he go? - Don't show it to my face! - Oops! Kristjan? Get him! The door! Faster! He can't get anywhere! Come out! We know you're there! Come out! He's hiding. I can't see him. How will we get him out of there? - I don't see him. - Are you sure? - I can't see him. - It's closed! - What are we going to do? - I don't know. Come out! Try again! Kristjan, seriously. Come out, we promise we won't hurt you. Kristjan, seriously, come out! Promise you won't tell on us, and everything will be fine. - What are we going to do? - What a coward! He's signalling! - Come out! - Get lost! I won't come out! - Set yourself on fire! - Set yourself on fire! Let's smoke him out of there! I don't know... I'll do it myself. You can't... Let me try. - You can't... - Shut up! - It's starting! - No, it's not. It's starting! Move. - Did you hear that? - A cough! - Isn't that going to kill him? - He can come out! He'll be out when he can't breathe anymore. Back up! - Kristjan! - Oh, boy! Is it getting hot? Can you hear us? - Come out before you get burned! - Kristjan! Kristjan! Damn it, someone's coming! What the hell? Hey, what's going on? - Get out of here! - Come. It's dangerous, don't do that! I'll show you. The guard is back there! - Under the pile! - Check the pile! Take it off! Quickly! Pull this! Push it! Got it! - Loore! - Lisandra? - Lisandra! - Loore! - She was supposed to be home. - You bring her everywhere! Wait! Leave me a flashlight at least! Loore! - Lisandra! - Loore! - Lisandra, I'm here! Lisandra! - Loore! Child found in the forest. We're coming back. My sister is still here. Bring blankets! Kristjan, don't tell on us. Don't tell on us. I don't want to go to my dad's. Please, don't tell on us. I don't want to go to another school. Please, don't tell anything, please. Please, don't tell on us. It was our secret. Nobody was supposed to find out. I should have done something earlier. It was my fault, that I didn't dare. That's all I have to say. Well... Sounds convincing. Now what? What's going to happen next? We'll let you know. You'll need to come to the station, for statements. Will he survive? You're right to worry. You should've thought of that before. - That's one word. - Yes. How is he? We'll question him when he regains consciousness. Luckily I haven't seen you anymore. Keep it up. Goodbye. - He'll live. - Yes. Why didn't you tell me it was that serious? Your Loore runs around with Kristjan the most. Maybe blame my 4 year old as well? All of our children are suspects now. Ariel is so sensitive. She is easily manipulated. Anyone can do it. I don't think Mia-Margot knew anything, she would've told me. - Stop it! - I would want... Stop moping. The man will get better soon. I brought you something from Finland. A retro game. So you would have less time for stupid things. I used to do all kinds of stupid things when I was young. There was a sucker in our class, and we bullied him. Once we put his schoolbag, jacket and stuff into the boiler for them to burn. The boilerman, the same Oaf, got in trouble because of it. We were so stupid. Don't be scared. Everyone knows - boys will be boys. The guard will tell what actually happened. Sit. Don't jump. I have to go now. He'll be back soon. I promise. Now I know, I won't let anyone tell me, how it should be. After what happened, I'm not afraid of anything anymore. Come, sit here. Sorry, my brother is back there. Are you okay? You know, I thought about it. When I go to work in Finland, I will buy a car. I'll teach you to drive. We'll beat everyone in a rally. Easily.
