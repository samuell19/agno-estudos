All children believe in magic and cease to do so only when they grow up. Except those who have been too disappointed by reality... to expect any reward from it. - Bruno Bettelheim - Who's that guy? - He's not a member of the gang. Are you awake, J.R.? I know where you're hiding, J. R. You're in the laundry, and I have a little surprise for you. Thomas, breakfast is ready! Go get your grandpa and come eat. And then... free the dog. WAR SOUNDS Rise and shine! On your feet or I'll shoot! Here. Ah, yes. Wait, wait, wait. Here we go. What? Now you're overdoing it. - Well, it's okay... - Soup's on! I caught this half-blind, diabetic prisoner. No big deal. Thomas, he's your grandfather. Show a little respect, please. He's right, you know. - Good morning. - Good morning, Thomas. Where is my medicine, Julie? Right in front of you. In front of you, grandpa. Ah, yes. I had seen it but I got a little distracted. - May I have a croissant, please, mom? - Your medicine first. Hey, you... I'm not drinking by myself. Bottoms up! That's it! Your croissant. Toy Center stock is down. What do you think, clad? - Should I buy some? - Don't you have enough stores? No. Buy it! So I'll get lots of toys! - Don't you have enough already? - I'll get more. Then I can sell them to Santa Claus. His mother's son, huh? And his father's. And his father's. Mom, Pilou says Santa doesn't exist. He says parents buy all the presents. Pilou? What rubbish he talks, that Pilou. - He's raving mad. - No, he's right. Santa's not real for him. Of course. He's naughty to his parents, doesn't work for school... - You hear that? - So Santa never comes to his place. His parents have to buy him presents for Christmas. And so, for Pilou, Santa's not real. Yeah... Makes sense. You know, I don't have to write to Santa anymore. - There's an easier way. - What? You can order through Minitel. Minitel? Yes, you can order through Minitel... but If I were you, I'd also write. Just to be safe. Will you mail it for me? Here. Okay. Here comes your cohort. Don't experiment too much. And no more holes in the parquet. This house is like Swiss cheese. Right. Tommy... you look after your grandfather. - Don't forget his insulin shots. - Distilled water would be just as efficient, you know. Mom! Don't worry about grandpa. I have a very important meeting tonight. I'll be home late! Have fun, you two. - Good morning, madam. - Good morning, Charles, how are you? No, not here. Let's go. I have to go all out this year. Thomas has his doubts about Santa. That's normal, he's ten. Well, I still believed in Santa at eleven, so will Thomas. Yes, but you were no genius... designing computer programs all the time. But Thomas isn't like that. How would you know anyway? Despite his high IQ he believes in Santa, fairies, goblins, the works! That's what's so nice about him. He's like all other kids. Look. You see the address? "Santa Claus, North Pole". I order all that's on it, plus a few extras? See you tonight? Sit down, gentlemen, sit down. I called this meeting because tonight's Christmas and we're open late. We're going to hire lots of extra help. I want fairies on roller skates, clowns, fire-eaters. Tell all the cashiers to dress up. I want Santas at every corner. Without wrist watches, please, or pants showing underneath the robe. I want a party. I want the world to know that Santa patronizes our store. But a party takes preparation. There's no time. Why didn't you mention this last month? Because... last month kids still believed in Santa Claus. Can't you see they always answer the same? "What's your name? How old are you? Have you been nice?" - It's for retards. - You're the retard. - You believe in nothing. - And you in everything. I told you Santa's not real. This is Thomas. Santa Claus, if you're real, please answer. "What's your name?" Okay! I've had enough, I'll split. Right, I don't want to see you anymore! - You're really stupid. - No more help with your homework then! And you'll fix your videogames yourself! Oh, Well... "This is Santa Claus. What do you want, Thomas?" Come back, Pilou! He answered! So you're real? "Yes. That's why I'm answering you." - If this is a joke, I'll break your neck. - See for yourself! Where do you live? "North Pole." - It's just some jerk answering. - You're the jerk. It's only what you want to hear! All right, I'll ask a question. Type! Come on, come on. Is it true you got midgets working for you, like in stories? - "No" - Shit... I was sure he'd say yes. And I was sure he'd say no because your question is completely idiotic! You're coming to me tonight? WHY ASK IF YOU ALREADY KNOW? To see if you're the real Santa. I AM, AND IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME, I'LL HANG UP. I believe you, don't get mad. You should stop talking to this guy. There must be some sort of interference. You are connected to another message board on the same server. DO YOU WANT TO PLAY WITH ME? Could be a kinky message board! A message board for weirdos. You're the weirdo! - Do you want to play with me? - What'll we play? Give me your address. But you should know it. You know everything. You want my letter? My mother has it. She is the manager at Le Prihtemps. She has a great assortment! It's with your mother? - Can I help you? - I'm here for the job. You still need Santas? Yes, just fill in the form. This crate's prehistoric! Why doesn't she buy herself a Testarossa or something like that? She likes it for sentimental reasons. She's attached to it, that's all. That car's offbeat. Well... offbeat...? - A 12. - Pardon? - A 12. - Yes, okay. It's hard to see the numbers. My eyes... I can see fine, sure... but not that fine. - You said 12? - Yeah, yeah. Yes, well... you don't want the screwdriver? - No, a 12 wrench! - I know, I know, I heard you! Thanks, grandpa. That should do the trick. - You sit at the wheel, grandpa? - Okay. Getting there. - Wait till I tell you before you start it. - Yes, I'm waiting. Go! - You give me the wheel? - With pleasure. Take it. Well, Tommy, I'm proud of you. And your mother would be pleased if she could see you. Yes. And she wouldn't need to be chauffeured around anymore. - A spin in the park, grandpa? - Yes. But no slalom between the trees. - And no speeding this time. - All right, all right. Network interconnection: okay. Now, compatibility test between armband monitor, traps, and cameras. This is zero hour, J.R.! Not now, J.R., I'm working! All right. What was I saying? Ah, yes, check chain of command. Start compilation. A little CALL in assembler to optimize everything. DINING ROOM We made it, J.R.! Imagine, with this armband I can tape all my cameras! And tonight, if Santa really exists, I'll be the first kid to see him! I'll have evidence that he exists! And maybe I can even capture him. Come around, enjoy yourselves with us! There's a spectacle in the street tonight! We have many attractions for you! Ladies and gentlemen, missus, children and angels, come around! Enjoy yourselves with us! There's a spectacle in the street tonight! We have spectacular attractions! Acrobats, jugglers, clowns... Jeff and his umbrella, Mousse and his magic eye! I will perform comical gymnastics for you! Come around, come around and laugh with us! Enjoy yourselves! Don't just pass by! You won't regret it! - What's your name? - Marion. I don't like your face. You're not the real Santa. What have you clone? Are you crazy or something? Don't cry, darling, don't cry. Where's your mom? She went in to buy something for five minutes. - She left you alone? - Not alone, with Santa Claus. We'll wait for her together. You're fired. Go to the personnel office. - What's your name? - Marion. - Are you coming with me? - Yes. PERSONNEL OFFICE Just a moment, please. Yes... The boss's order must be delivered. It's in the second basement. Right, it's for her little son. Hey. Be sure you deliver to the caretakers. Not to the kid. Yes. I'm counting on you. You'll be responsible, you hear? Bye. What can I do for you? - Is this the boss's order? - Yes, that's it. - Life of Riley, huh? - Yes, the life of Riley. - Hey, take these, too. - All right. Well, will you dream or will you play? I'm in the maze. So what comes next? - You're stabbed twice in the back. - Ah, well... You're hit once. Costs you four hit points. - What do you do? - I use my third eye to see who's behind me. Okay. It's a troll. I throw a light to blind him! He protects himself from the light. Your turn. What do you do? You know, grandpa, I wonder whether Santa really exists. And Napoleon, and cavemen, and all that... Did they really exist? So you doubt not only Santa Claus but the whole history of mankind? - There's no evidence. - But there is. Take the cavemen for example: There are cave drawings, even skeletons. But Santa... his skeleton was never found. Well, excuse me... but Santa Claus isn't dead. Yes. - Have they found Vercingetorix's skeleton? - Well... no. - Then how do you know he existed? - Because it's written in history. - Maybe it's a lie. You've never seen him. - That's true! Tell me, Thomas, do you believe in aliens? Of course. You've seen them? Well... no. - I captured the ring. - Bravo, grandpa! You've finally completed the quest! 1,000 experience points and you change levels at last. - What do you mean, "at last"? - Listen, grandpa... we've been playing for two years, and you're still on level 1. Come here, you scoundrel. Are you making fun of old grandpa by any chance? - Tell me, grandpa... - Yes? Could Santa Claus be an alien? Tell me, could it be that Santa Claus is occupying your mind a lot? Come on, let's go to bed now. Take it easy, grandpa. You too, J.R.! Otherwise Santa Claus won't bring you anything. Come on. Come on! How beautiful our tree is! It really is the king of the forest! You're dressed up as Santas this year. That's a good idea. Mrs. Julie has only good ideas. Is all that for Thomas? Stop that noise, J.R. You'll get us caught. You stay here, J.R. So, if I get caught, you'll still get your presents. Okay? We inform our customers that this store's closing at 10 p. m. Please go to the checkout. We wish you a merry Christmas. What a clay. - Wait. It's not over yet. - What do you mean by "not over yet"? There's all the accounting to do. Let's do it on Monday. And lose a two-day value date on today's revenues? There's at least ten million! Look, it's 10:30 p.m. on the 24th of December. - You'll never get an armored car. - I had them on the phone. The truck will be here at 12:30. We'll do the accounting and prepare the money. No, listen, I'll do the accounting and I'll prepare the money. And you take my car and go home to your kid. It's only accountancy. I don't need you here. Unless you don't trust me. Okay, I'll be in the next room. Roland. Thank you. - Hello? - Hello, Tommy. This is mommy, honey. Why are you still up? You're waiting for Santa, huh? YEP- You know you shouldn't try to see Santa Claus... because he'll get mad and turn into an ogre. - An ogre? - Yes an ogre. Quickly, go to bed. He'll come as soon as you're asleep. You'll call back to see if I'm sleeping? Okay, but close your eyes then. - They're already closed. - Here? a big noisy kiss in your neck. You'll wake me up. See you later, mommy. See you later, honey. SNOW SPRAY Thomas? Grandpa! Grandpa! - What is it, Tommy? - Santa Claus... he killed J.R.! Santa Claus? What are you talking about? You want to play with me? Come, grandpa! - Hurry up, grandpa! - Where are you taking me? - What...? - Faster! Come on, grandpa! Come on! Hurry! Mommy's car! It's the only way to leave, grandpa. - But you don't have the keys. - Come! They're in the ignition. Hurry up, grandpa! Hurry! Faster, grandpa! Start. Start! Start! Start! Start! Start! Start! Start, you hear? Start! What shall I do, grandpa? What shall I do? - Step on it! Step on it! - I can't! He's right in front of us! Oh, no...! Start. Start! Close the window, grandpa! Go! Now! Quick, grandpa! - How did he get in? - Through the chimney. Why didn't the alarm system work? Well, I turned it off. You forgot to do it. Santa had to get in without waking anyone. What's this strange place? A secret passage. No one knows about it. Not even mom. It was a secret between clad and me. All my dad's toys are here, and his dad's. And all his ancestors'. And all of mine, one clay. Imagine that Santa had to carry all this on his back, just for our family. It's the telephone in your mother's office. It's still working. ' P“ 90! ' No! - You stay here, I'll go! - You can't do it, grandpa! - Your eyesight's fuzzy! - My eyesight's fuzzy... Okay, we'll both stay here and wait for your mom. - It's too dangerous... - And it's not dangerous for her? She has to come with reinforcements. Didn't you see what he did to the car? Please let me go, grandpa. No...! Nothing can happen to me. I have my armband monitor. Do you want me to tell you where Santa is right now? He's... He's... He's on the staircase. You see? No danger. I'll take another route. You know what we'll do? So you don't have to worry, I'll give you a walkie-talkie. Then we'll always be in contact. Okay? I guess if I say no, it won't change a thing, huh? Affirmative. What are they doing? Why don't they answer? Shit! Do you want me to dial for you, Thomas? Thomas. Thomas... Thomas? You're gonna fall... Mommy... Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! - I keep calling but no one answers. - Did you try your private line? - There's no answer either. - Listen, keep calm. Call the caretakers, send them to the mansion. - I'll keep calling your place. - Okay. See you soon. Busy... Thomas calling grandpa. Answer, grandpa. Thomas calling grandpa. Answer, grandpa! Thomas calling grandpa. Please answer, grandpa! Hello. is that you, Tommy? I'm sorry, I couldn't find the switch. Are you okay, Tommy? Yes, I'm okay, but the phone doesn't work. Don't worry, grandpa. I'll send an emergency message with my computer. Someone's got to see it. So don't worry, grandpa. I have the situation under control. Don't forget to call me. And be careful. Who's there? Is that you, Tommy? Tommy, is that you? Is that you, Tommy? Is that...? Who are you? What do you wan t? Grandpa... Grandpa... No! It's me, grandpa. The mansion is gigantic, and there are hundreds of rooms like this one. I'm just an old and tired cripple. I'm just holding you back. The journey ends here for me. I can't go on. I have nothing to lose if I stay here. Come on, stop crying. ”Lift up your hearts", chin up. Save your life, Thomas! Mine is finished. I'll stay here. You can stop your western, grandpa. It's over now. We're going. - Shit! - What is it now? - We can't get out of here, grandpa. - Why? - Because my armband is broken. - So what? Don't ask, grandpa. It's too long to explain. Listen, Roland, it's impossible! It's been busy for 15 minutes! I tried the other line, I tried the caretakers! I'm sure something's happened. I'm sure! It's my fault for leaving them alone. They must've taken daddy to the hospital. That's why they're not answering. No, if anything had happened to your clad, Thomas would've called. No, the phone must be out of order, that's all. Listen, if it relaxes you, I'll call the police and send them to the mansion. - Is that okay? - No. I'll call, they know me. You keep calling home, okay? Don't worry, I won't skip out on them. HELP. SANTA CLAUS IS ATFACKING MY GRANDPA AND ME. COME QUICK. TOM. All right... The upstairs windows aren 't locked. But it is too high to jump. There 3 only one solution: Disconnect the armband and the automatic lock system. But that'll take time. Grandpa, you must hide. I'd like to talk to the commissioner. How come he's not there? I know it's Christmas! Listen, this is Mrs. de Frémont speaking. I'm very worried because I keep calling home and get no answer. The caretakers don't answer either. I'm sure something happened. Could you go to the mansion right away, please? Yes, I'm on my way! But you'll be there before me! Thank you very much, sir. Radio telephone, please hold on, we 're trying to connect you. The number you're calling doesn't answer. The number you're calling... It's fixed, grandpa! We can go! No! Scram, Pilou! Scram! - Are you okay, Thomas? - Yes, I'm okay! Don't worry, grandpa, I'm fine. I fell, so it hurts a little. Don't move, yes? That would be difficult, you know? You don't know where I am, huh? You can't know because you don't know the house. This is my home, and you'll be sorry you ever came. You killed my dog. You tried to kill grandpa and you hurt me. Only because I wanted to see you. But now I'm mad too! And even though you're Santa Claus, I swear you're gonna be scared! DEAR SANTA CLAUS... No! - Are you okay? - Yes, I'm okay. Did you speak to them? - Wait, I'll help you get back on the road. - Did you speak to them? It's over, grandpa! We're saved! We're saved! The police are here! I told you they will come! I'll help you get out of there. Grandpa? What's wrong, grandpa? - Answer me, grandpa! - The insulin... Quick, the insulin! I win. You lose. Now I hide and you seek. Okay? You count to 20! No cheating, huh? One... two... three... You hang on, grandpa! I'll go get the insulin at the caretakers'! Charles, Louise, are you there? Patrol car 427, calling central. Answer, central! This is central. We read you, 427. I'm Thomas de Frémont! Send an ambulance to the mansion! You're cheating! Why? Grandpa? Are you all right, grandpa? Grandpa? Grandpa? Grandpa! Breathe! Grandpa! Breathe! Breathe! Don't die, grandpa! Don't die! Don't die, grandpa! Breathe, breathe! Grandpa! Grandpa! Breathe! That's it. Easy! Yes, that's it, grandpa. Breathe. Easy. No! No! No... Go away! Go away... - Get down, Thomas! - No! You shouldn't 't try to see Santa Claus... because he 'll get mad and turn into an ogre. I told you Santa '5 not real. But Santa... his skeleton was never fauna'. Santa Claus isn't dead. I'll be the first kid to see him! I'll have evidence that he exists! Get down, Thomas! No! Thomas. My little boy. My little boy. Thomas... it's over. Thomas... it's over. Over! - Over! - Mom... Mom... It's my fault. It's my fault, mom. I wanted to see Santa Claus.
