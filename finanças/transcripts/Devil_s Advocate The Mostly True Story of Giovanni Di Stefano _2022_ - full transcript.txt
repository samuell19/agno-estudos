He came under the immigrant scheme. My mum and I in 1961. Northamptonshire, that was pretty tough. There was an awful lot of racism in those days. I was an eyetie. People were always bullying or teasing me. So I became John because I wanted to be one of the British. (slow music) Wellingborough Grammar School was a formal school. This was manifested in the wearing of gowns by masters. You stand up straight, boy. Take your hands out of your pockets. Corporal punishment was readily and regularly applied. It was administered using pieces of wood and gym slippers, which were given familiar names in order to increase the mystique around them. Cuthbert was one. You had to wear proper school uniform, black shoes, black socks, black trousers, white shirt, school tie, blazer, badge. In 1971, I moved into the sixth form. And in English literature there was a new boy sitting next to me who introduced himself as John Di Stefano. John was always immaculately turned out, as many young Italian men were. His name stood out. It was different. We had very few people who were other than straightforward white English then. But there is a photograph in which he is the object of a large number of pointing hands and fingers. And he is smiling as if he's revelling in it. And the others, I think they're probably thinking, "Not a bad chap." I think he became a kind of mascot. He was a natural performer, was quite happy on stage. Out, I say, from this place at once. [Narrator] We had a pop group called Chuck Will's Widow. [Presenter] Longest-running top rate talent show, "Opportunity Knocks." (upbeat music) [Narrator] We went on "Opportunity Knocks." [Interviewer] He claims he went on "Opportunity Knocks." (laughs) You mean the one with Mr. Green? [Presenter] And here he is, Mr. Starmaker himself, your host, Hughie Green. (upbeat music) (audience applauding) [Interviewer] What do you think of that? I never heard about it. But it wouldn't surprise me that he claimed he'd been on "Opportunity Knocks." It would surprise me to learn that he'd actually been on it. Was he? [Interviewer] We don't know. He claims he was, but we can't find the recording. There's a pattern emerging here, isn't there?

(dramatic music) [Reporter] Devil's Advocate, Mr. Murder, call him what you will, his client list runs the who's who of the criminal world. Giovanni Di Stefano was one of the attorneys representing Saddam Hussein. Mr. Di Stefano, good morning to you. Good morning, Katie. I defend people who have committed the most serious of criminal offences. You know, I don't defend Snow White. [Interviewer] Do you live in a fantasy land? If you really believe that, that's fine, but that's a matter for you. I really don't care. (traffic rumbling) (rain pattering) (slow dramatic music) After five years of investigation, we had concrete evidence that Giovanni Di Stefano had never qualified as an Italian avvocato. And we suspected he'd defrauded victims as well. But he had still managed to find his way to the top of his profession. We were hoping that he would be arrested in Rome. That's where we thought he might be. But it became apparent very quickly that he was no longer in Italy. The real challenge is that we didn't know where he was. He could have been absolutely anywhere in the world. (slow dramatic music) [Narrator] I adapt my life almost like animals. Animals don't think about the future. They think about living today. They don't plan for their death because they can be eaten tomorrow. So I just move on and move forward. I don't have security. If you want to kill me, go ahead. (dramatic music) We had an Interpol Red Notice, so wherever he was going to turn up, that's where he'd be detained. (man speaking in Spanish) (camera clicking) (camera clicking) (camera clicking) (doorbell buzzing) (dramatic music) (slow dramatic music) (phone ringing) We were contacted quite suddenly, a bit out of the blue, by the Spanish authorities to say, "We have located your man," and they had arrested him. (slow dramatic music) This is 2011. This case had gone on since 2006. That's a long time to be looking for one person that had caused all this harm. So it was a massive breakthrough moment. Pretty typical of Giovanni Di Stefano. He had played what I would describe a bit of a tactical game. (birds chirping) (slow music) I'd discovered that Giovanni was to be arrested. The barrister who was prosecuting him contacted me unofficially and said, "I know that you've done some work with Giovanni." "Do you know where he is?" Blah, blah, blah, and so on. I happened to know where he was. He was in Spain at the time. So I called him and I said to him, "Look, there's a warrant for your arrest. "Let me try and negotiate a deal" "that will allow you to return without being in custody" "awaiting your trial, that you would get bail." He was clearly affected by the fact that he was going to be tried, and he knew that the establishment would be against him. I don't think that particularly frightened him 'cause he felt that he could probably beat it. (birds chirping) (slow dramatic music) We travelled out with two colleagues with the agreement Spanish police would hand him over to us. I was slightly nervous. It was just the fact that I thought, "Well, maybe something is now going to go wrong again. "The Spanish will have done something with the paperwork "that won't be quite right or something," "or we can't leave today," "or he will feign some illness or something." (dramatic music) You know, you've seen this name every single day for the best part of five years, and now he's gonna be handcuffed to us potentially for two hours. It was absolutely surreal. (slow music) (plane engines roaring) I knew he would turn on the charm. And I wasn't wrong. I wasn't disappointed, put it like that. We had coffee, and being a football fan, we just talked about Madrid, and he talked about a story about his son that was apparently on the books with Madrid. Then he talked about his relationship with the chairman. I don't know if he was telling the truth, I don't know. For a man who'd flown to some of the biggest war zones in the world, to say he was a nervous flyer was an understatement. As we came in to land at Gatwick, I remember him grabbing my forearm and saying, "Oh, I'm a bit of a nervous flyer." We just laughed about it. (camera clicking) There was paparazzi and cameras. I'm not saying he set that up, but we certainly didn't, and how did they know about that? (camera clicking) A lawyer nicknamed The Devil's Advocate has been arrested in Spain on charges relating to fraud, theft, and money laundering in the UK. I was completely unaware that the police had got their claws into him. (slow music) I opened the pages of "The Daily Telegraph," and I saw a report on some kind of arraignment of Di Stefano. Bloody hell, that's John Di Stefano who I sat next to at school. When I heard the details of the deceptions, it confirmed a tendency that I'd been half aware of in his school days. And as the scale of his activities became apparent, a sense of awe developed. When we heard about Saddam Hussein, Arkan, Milosevic, some of the biggest villains of the late 20th century, the sense of awe increased. How could somebody do this? This is a red letter day. I wanted to find out when he was on trial 'cause I wanted to be there. (slow music) When they looked at the diary, the first available date was 2013. We'd have to wait two years for the trial. And at that point, my heart sank. But I saw the bigger picture. It sounds strange, but after five years I knew that the work was now going to really begin. And the reason I say that is because he was now gonna get the opportunity to give his side of the story. (dramatic music) When Di Stefano provided his pretrial defence case statements, the whole case took a rather dramatic twist. (dramatic music) [Narrator] The defendant is a long-standing member of the Security Services, MI6. (camera clicking) (dramatic music) He was claiming to be a spy. [Narrator] Part of his duties was to build up a reputation as an international lawyer, and thereby gain access to some of the world's major persons of interest to MI6, Mossad, and the CIA. [Reporter] Di Stefano was saying that he had worked. Under the cover of a lawyer to essentially befriend despots. [Narrator] Martin Royston Chambers of Little Rissington, Oxfordshire made contact with him and recruited him in the 1970s to carry out covert activities on behalf of the British government. He named somebody, and he said, "This person's my handler," "and I've been on the Secret Service payroll for years." [Narrator] In doing so, he placed himself and his family in grave danger. (guns firing) Indeed, in 2006, his own father was murdered by the British government to force him to continue with his covert actions on their behalf. This prosecution is a politically-motivated abuse of process. It is no coincidence that these arrest warrants were obtained just after the accused's request for consent to privately prosecute Anthony Charles Lynton Blair, the former British Prime Minister, for war crimes in relation to the treatment of prisoners in Iraq. It had gone from not a question of his legal status now, but actually a political trial. If this was going to be his defence, and this was gonna be a political trial, we had to discredit what he was saying. But it was going to be problematic. By their very nature, MI6, very secretive organisations, they don't want to tell you too much information. It's something that we needed to bottom out. (dramatic music) The Di Stefano case was totally unique. Essentially, it was Jerry against Di Stefano. (phone ringing) Whilst he was out on bail, he took the whole prosecution to another level. I received a call from the Crown Prosecution Service. The lawyer said, "You'll never believe what we've just received." Jerry came in and said that Mr. Di Stefano was suing him for perverting the course of justice. (dramatic music) This was a private prosecution targeting specifically Jerry. No one else was named. It's not something I've ever seen, past or present. The allegation was that I had encouraged a particular witness to make a witness statement against him. He was entitled to make that allegation, like anyone could. We couldn't ignore it. This was not the City of London Police. This was a personal attack on, "DC Jerry Walters is a corrupt police officer." "He has been encouraging witnesses" "to give evidence against me." I felt it personally. At that moment in time, I was angry. I had an unblemished police record, you know. I'd never had any allegations against me for dishonesty or violence. What I found the most difficult aspect is that, of course, he splattered all over social media, "Corrupt City of London officer." My kids were teenagers, and they live on social media. And they saw that, and so had their friends seen it. So that hurt more than anything. I was worried in that the worst case scenario was obviously a finding against Jerry, which is a massive deal for Jerry as an individual, his career, his career beyond policing after he retires, massive implications. Also, if there was a finding of guilt against Jerry, that would put the case against Di Stefano in massive jeopardy. I trotted along to the court, now finding myself as a defendant. Was I nervous? Yes, of course I was nervous. Did it bother me? Yes, it did, of course it did. (dramatic music) Waiting for someone to pass judgement on your character. In fact, what he was passing judgement on was my police career. We obviously wrapped some security around Jerry in terms of getting some legal advice, so he was properly represented at the first hearing. Di Stefano put the case against me. It was two counts on this indictment that he'd drawn up. I really wasn't sure what course of action the judge was gonna take. (gavel banging) (slow music) The district judge gave his ruling, he said, "There's no merit in your prosecution." And he threw it out. Massive relief for him personally. Massive relief for us, and we could just get on with the investigation. (traffic rumbling) (slow music) I felt very vindicated, but it left a very bad taste in my mouth. (dramatic music) It heightened the feeling that I could not afford to lose this case, because if he was gonna do that to me, what was he going to do to the legal system? By hook or by crook, we had to win this case. (slow dramatic music) As we got nearer to the trial, my honest view was that we could do no more. You know, this was seven years' investigation now, and the evidence was all there. But of course, we had to factor in the Di Stefano element. (people talking) (cameras clicking) [Man] V for victory. [Photographer] Swing around a bit. (people talking) [Man] V for victory. [Man] All right, sorry, guys. Let's go. No, I do mind. We've got no comment at this stage, thank you. (dramatic music) Normally, fraud cases are very, very dull and boring. This was completely different. Here was a hugely colourful character on trial for conning all sorts of people, not least the legal establishment themselves, but also there were victims, you know, the likes of you and me. 25 fraud charges, and these were charges beyond impersonating a legally-qualified lawyer. This was stealing from his clients, which was a whole aspect of his character that I don't think we knew anything about. But knowing his background and knowing the way he operates, I thought that he must have laid some loopholes somewhere, and there was some way he could go back and get out of it. Giovanni Di Stefano is 57 years of age. He was born in Italy on the 1st of July, 1955. After the prosecution made their opening speech, the defence asked the judge for Di Stefano to be given permission to leave the dock and to come and sit behind him so that he could give instructions better. And the judge agreed. And Di Stefano rose to his feet in the dock with this massive smile on his face. And he looked across us at the press as if to say, you know, "Here I am." "I'm halfway to winning now." "I'm out already." (slow dramatic music) This trial, more than any trial in my police service, I knew, and everybody knew, gonna come down to personalities. Would they believe Di Stefano when he took the stand? One of the key elements of any trial is when the defendant gives evidence from the witness box, and we were expecting big things from Di Stefano. His defence was that he had acted at all times in good faith. [Giovanni] I honestly believe that I can advise and provide legal services to anyone that seeks my assistance. His problem was that he had officially claimed that he was a qualified Italian lawyer. [Giovanni] I may not be formally qualified, but who can say that I'm not an effective lawyer? I think it's a great shame that he didn't feel that he could go and study and become a lawyer, because he could've, and he would have been a good lawyer. [Giovanni] Every team has to have a leader. Leaders appoint generals. QC is the general on the front line. Of course, when he's up on his feet, he has command of the situation. But I was in charge at a political level, shall we say, if that can be an analogy. He said that, "I am the leader, and the QCs are my generals." And that was probably the worst thing that you could have said to two QCs and a judge. That one remark summed up his arrogance beyond all else. I always dealt with Giovanni on the basis that, so long as the instructions came legitimately from a firm of solicitors, I didn't mind. The fact that he was a bit of a maverick, I quite liked. For far too long, the legal profession has been a very sort of strait-laced profession. And if there is some bucking of the system by those who are ready to do it, then why not? Of course, there was still a possibility that he was gonna make great play of his work for the Secret Services. He gave a story of his father's death back in Italy. (slow dramatic music) [Giovanni] He died at, I'm told, approximately 7:20 p.m. in the village Petrella Tifernina, where all of us were born. He was coming home. (footsteps tapping) He was walking in the dark, and nobody saw anything. (dramatic music) He claimed that because of his own involvement with the Secret Services and his involvement with, particularly Saddam Hussein in Iraq, that as a retribution, someone had murdered his father. [Giovanni] There was a hole in his head where the blood was coming out, which was consistent with being hit with an ice pick. He didn't just say he'd been murdered. He went to the extent of saying he'd actually been murdered with an ice pick. [Giovanni] I received a call from the mayor of the village saying, "What do you want to do, Giovanni?" I was in the middle of making a decision on Saddam Hussein, and he told me my dad is dead. And so with a great mea culpa, he was sort of holding his head and saying. [Giovanni] If I wasn't so full of my own bloody self-importance and taken that case, my dad would still be alive. But I did my best for Saddam Hussein. I was scared that there would be other consequences. I have children. I have a mother. I have family there. The message was very, very crystal clear. We were aware that he'd made an allegation to the Italian authorities. We didn't know about the ice pick. Something that we needed to bottom out, clearly. We finally heard that MI6 were going to deliver something to the court. So I went down. Sure enough, in the reception there was an envelope. It had been delivered by a motorcycle. It was addressed to the judge, and only he was to open that envelope and see the contents of it. This could have a serious impact. From the judge's observations, Di Stefano was not a spy and had never been a spy. And he had no involvement with MI6 and clearly had never been on the payroll. (dramatic music) This is a complete fabrication, isn't it? This whole idea that your father was murdered is something that you've dreamt up in order to try and gain some sympathy with the jury. [Giovanni] I'm not even going to bother to answer your question. You have your job to do. I had mine to do at the time. We had an email communication from the Italian authorities. There was a statement from the ambulance driver. And essentially, the very day that Saddam Hussein was hung, his father had died of a heart attack. Your father, Mr. Di Stefano, died of natural causes. [Giovanni] That is what was on the certificate. You're quite right. But that's not what happened. And that's not what's being investigated at the moment. [Jerry] He dug himself deeper and deeper in the hole, conspiracy theories about what had gone on. His explanations got crazier and crazier. But it seemed he genuinely believed that he would be acquitted, that no jury in the land would surely ever find him guilty. (slow dramatic music) So the closing arguments were made. Then the judge made his remarks, and then he sent the jury out. It is a very nervous time. You never quite knew where the jury was sitting right up until the final moment. If he was acquitted, there would be serious ramifications, I believe, for the legal system in the UK. He would be able to reinvent himself as a lawyer. "I've been through the system." "The evidence has been tested," "has been tried, and I've been found not guilty." (clock ticking) The stake for me was a huge amount. If he was acquitted of the charges, then there was always the realistic possibility that he would go after me personally again. (dramatic music) (slow music) Once the jury is sent out is an incredibly tense time. (coin clacking) There's nothing else after this. There's no more evidence you can present to them. (clock ticking) You can't second guess what they're gonna come back with. I still think he's a bloody good lawyer, I'm sorry. If he's not a qualified lawyer, and he's just an amateur, how did he defeat the British judicial system twice? The way he talked about, you know, his time in Iraq and what he was doing, like, you know, with Saddam Hussein, you could tell that he had no legal qualifications. He did find problems in the law. He did identify issues for his clients, irrespective of whether or not he was legally qualified. Normally, if people are competent, they're not gonna be thieves. The two things don't go together. A competent person can earn their own money. The fact that he achieved so much without the professional qualifications, that he didn't study law at Cambridge, which is what I believe he claimed to have done at some point. To have been self-taught, I personally see that as a heck of an accomplishment. Try and empathise, like, not so much with him, but with what the people have been through. And my understanding is that for some people, it was years of suffering. You can't have a situation where people are going around purporting to be lawyers, heaping further misery on people. The fact is, is that some people may have been improperly represented. But we have a system where everybody is regarded as innocent until they are proven to be guilty. I don't want to live in a society in which a defendant is already guilty before he even stands up in court. (slow dramatic music) (clock ticking) Within four hours, the jury were back. Police always think that if a jury come back quickly, they've had it. It was very nerve-racking, I must admit, going back into court. Many people would say that when the jury file into court, if they're looking at the defendant, it's not guilty. When the jury came in, quite a few of them I noticed actually staring at him, looking at him, and I thought, "That's not a good sign." This was a culmination of seven years of hard work. Of course it's self-doubt. It is butterflies in your stomach. (dramatic music) (slow dramatic music) The clerk said, "Answer the following questions yes or no." "Are you agreed on a verdict to all the charges?" And the answer was, "Yes." Are they gonna say guilty? Are they gonna say not guilty? And there's that sort of heart thumping moment where it could go either way. "Do you find Giovanni Di Stefano guilty or not guilty?" "Guilty." (soft music) A man who worked as a defence lawyer for Saddam Hussein and claimed to have offered legal advice to Osama bin Laden had a dark secret. He wasn't really a lawyer at all. (rain pattering) [Reporter] Giovanni Di Stefano was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being convicted of 25 charges of fraud and deception. The best way to describe it is a thoroughly dishonest individual, very cunning, very clever. [Reporter] One of the convictions involved taking compensation money from a man who lost his arm in a car accident. He received a massive sentence. I mean, 14 years for fraud is a huge number. What? Surely, whatever he's done it can't justify a 14-year sentence, can it? (slow music) It was a significant conviction, no question about it. And it is no question that he should have served a significant period of time in jail. He shouldn't have been taking money from people. But when you add the 8 1/2 years default sentence for the confiscation hearing that he had, you've got 22 1/2 years. Murderers don't get that. It's ridiculous. The money you stole, over 1 million pounds, was a large sum. You could argue that it was the legal establishment's revenge. And certainly there were a lot of people who were very happy to see him convicted. Was it disproportionate? I would say no. Because anyone who says that has not accepted the, I suppose the misery he brought to a lot of people. So I have no qualms whatsoever about the sentence that were handed down. The judge was absolutely crushing in his sentencing remarks, highlighting the deep cynicism that Di Stefano had shown to these poor clients, whose life savings and money he had stolen. (slow dramatic music) What he did certainly constitutes emotional, and psychological, and mental rape and manipulation. It's not so much about the money. It would have made such a massive difference to my life at the time. But what I'm left with 12 years later is a scarring effect. And no amount of time in jail will ever be enough for that. (traffic rumbling) I taught Giovanni Di Stefano about the sometimes downright barmy religions that have arisen. Some of the stuff was frankly unbelievable. But the fact is that thousands and sometimes millions of people believed it. It may have been a formative influence on what he actually became. He would have realised there are no limits to human credulity. (people talking) (cameras clicking) As court reporters, we should have done more. [Katie] Mr. Di Stefano, good morning to you. Good morning, Katie. But there was an element I'm sure of, "It's such a good story." "I don't want it not to be true." Dr. Shipman never accepted that he murdered anybody. The media loved him 'cause he was good for a quote. Mr. Ronnie Biggs was not a participant in the Great Train Robbery on the 8th of August, 1963. That perpetuated the lie and the myth around his legal status. His acquittal has led to a persecution, in my view, and not a prosecution. Ironically, his love of the media is the thing that was his undoing. Mr. Di Stefano, thanks very much for spending a few moments with us here on CNN. Stick a camera in his face, he'd absolutely love it. (people talking) (cameras clicking) He saw his life as a movie. He'd flipping love to have a movie made about him. And someone should make a movie about him. (speaking in Italian) [Man] All right, stand by. And action. Should I give this straight? [Man] Quiet please. [Giovanni] You've asked me now twice the question. And I will answer you a third time. I am a qualified lawyer. [Man] Let's start again please. [Giovanni] I'm qualified in Italy. [Man] Hang on. This is a complete fabrication, isn't it? You live in a fairly enjoyable fantasy land. [Giovanni] For heaven's sake, this is TV. Am I going to be condemned on a television programme? You mustn't believe everything that you see on television. [Man] And hold. (slow music) [Interviewer] Do you know what he's planning to do when he's released? Yeah, I suspect that when Giovanni is released, he will want to make television programmes about his life and that he will seek to do things which will, again, put him back in the limelight. And if that means playing out the fact that he'd got one over the legal system in this country, he would do it. [Interviewer] He won't go quietly? There's not a chance of Giovanni ever going quietly. (dramatic music)
