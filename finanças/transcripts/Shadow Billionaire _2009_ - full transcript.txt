( Indistinct Radio Chatter ) ( Rumbling ) ( Crash ) Man: There Was A Scramble Of Boats Contacting The Navy, The Air Force Out Of Guam, Just Trying To Find The Plane. Newscaster: After An Entire Day Of Searching For A Sign Of The Downed Plane, Two Private Boats Found Not What They Were Hoping For, But What They Feared The Most--Two Bodies-- The Body Of 52-Year-Old Robert Long, The Pilot Of The Ill-Fated Flight, And The Body Of Saipan Congressman Jesus P. Mafnas. There Still Is No Sign Of Billionaire Larry Hillblom. There Is The Faintest Hope That Larry Hillblom Might Somehow Be Out There Alive. Man: He Was The Founder Of A Huge Corporation-- Dhl-- And He Was A Reputed Billionaire. And He Was A Genius. If You Took Out The Sexual Part Of Larry's Life, He Was A Fascinating Character, A Very Interesting Person. No One Ever Really Got The Full Picture Of Who Larry Was Because Larry Didn't Reveal His Full Self To Anyone. Man: What Came Out In The Weeks After His Disappearance Shocked Even Those Who Thought They Knew Him. Larry Hillblom Was Not Married, And He Didn't Have Any Children, As Far As Anybody Knew. Trying To Grab A Piece Of It. Trying To Grab A Piece Of It. There's A Lot Of Money There. Larry Cut A Wide Swath Through The Pacific. Ha Ha Ha! What Was It About The Story That Initially Intrigued Me? I Determine The Suitability Of A Subject For A Story On The Basis Of The Three Cs-- Cash, Crime, And Cunt. Those Are The Three Cs. Uh, Clearly, The Larry Hillblom Story Incorporated All Three Elements. The Outlines Of The Story Were Very Clear Going In. After Larry's Disappearance, Prostitutes Stepped Forward On Behalf Of Their Children, Claiming That They'd Been Fathered By This Rich American. And At The Front Of This Whole Thing, Is Larry-- The Enigma Of Who This Person Was. Because There's Something Diabolical In This Whole Thing. This Is It. Let's See If It's-- Looks Like It's Unlocked. ( Dog Barking ) Wow. This Is It. After 13 Years. What A Shame, Huh? This Was A Pretty House. My God. It Took Him Seven Or Eight Years To Build This House. He Was Really Proud Of How Cheap It Was. God, This Is Sad. Anderson: I Happened To Be Down At Cocos Island One Time With My Family, And People Were Pointing Him Out, And They Were Saying, "You Know Who That Is?" I Said, "No, Who's That?" Zoris, Shorts, T-Shirt. Didn't Look Like One Of The Wealthiest Businessmen In The World. I Found Out That He Was The "H" In Dhl It Turns Out That He Was Living Up On Saipan Because Of Tax Reasons, Primarily, But Also Because He Just Liked The Lifestyle. Larry Hillblom Came To Saipan In The Early 1980S. Saipan Is Part Of Micronesia. It Was Given To The United States Government As A Trust Territory After World War Ii. Today, This Is America's Farthest Western Outpost. People Were Mostly Just Curious About Larry. He Was A Little Bit Of A, Uh-- I Don't Want To Say Eccentric. But A Little Bit Of An Unusual Character. I Think People Felt Kind Of Good That He Chose To Live Out In The Marianas. There Must Be Going Out Here That Somebody That Rich-- Who Could Live Anywhere In The World-- Decided To Live Out Here With Us. I Think There Was A Deep Anarchistic Strain In Larry. He Knew He Could Get Away With A Great Deal In Saipan That He Couldn't Get Away With In America. Because There's No Other Explanation For Some Of The Truly Strange Elements Of This Story. Why, For Example, Did Larry Never Get A Pilot's License? He's Flying These Rickety Old Airplanes. Micronesia's Eccentric Billionaire-- Its History Was Really Larry Hillblom. Larry Had A Couple Of Planes, And He Really Treated Them Like Cars. He, Like, Parked In Your Garage. It Just Didn't Seem Like Larry Had A Really Good Maintenance Program. ( Laughs ) Larry Could Write A Check For A Learjet. But Larry Was Interested In Older Planes As A Hobby. And He Just Didn't Think It Was A Real Risk To Fly The Plane From Saipan To The Neighboring Islands. I Did. And So Did Everyone Else. Ha Ha! Oh, No. I Would Never Fly With Him. I Liked To Humor Him, But Not That Way. I Would Always Say, "Never, As Long As I Live-- I Will Never Fly With You." Oh, I Never-- I Never Flew With Him. Well, That Was Quite A Landing Coming In, You Know? Especially For Someone That's Had Six Beers For Breakfast. Calvo: I Think That, By Any Standard, Most People Would Say That Larry Was Just A Little Bit Different. But He Wasn't Seeing Shadows, And He Wasn't Doing Unusually Strange Things, Other Than, You Know, The Fact That Maybe He Never Grew Up. ( Laughter ) He Never Spoke Of His Hometown Or His Family. He Didn't Want To Talk About His Family, During His Time In Saipan. Woman: Larry's Dad And His Mother Helen-- We Were Very Good Friends, Very Good Friends. And I Remember Going Over To The Ranch, And Larry Was In A Crib, And He Was So Full Of Energy That He Had Chewed Off Clear Around The Top Rung Of The Crib. Man: He Looked Like A Little Kid, But He Just Did His Own Thing, You Know, Somebody Would Look At Something And They Would Just See What's There. He Would See What Possibilities Were There. I'm Sure A Lot Of People Just Thought, "Oh, This Guy Is Somewhere Out There Where The Buses Don't Go." He Loved Howard Hughes. He Thought Howard Hughes Was A Very Fascinating Person, And He Liked The Mystery Of Howard Hughes. During The Time We Were Growing Up, Howard Hughes Was Reclusive. No One Knew Where He Was At Or What He Was Doing. And That Fascinating Larry. We'd Be Walking Down The Street, And He Would Disappear. Two Or Three Blocks Later, He'd Show Up. You'd Never Know When He Was Gonna Show Up Or Take Off Or-- When We Were Roommates In College, We Wouldn't See Him For Days. I Don't Know Where He Went. Never Did Ask Him. Heh. Scheline: What Surprised Me More Than Anything Was The Fact That, When He Went Off To Law School, He Rarely Came Back To Town. Um, It Almost Was As If He Had Severed His Ties With The Community. Man: I Knew Larry Since He Was A Second-Year Student Here In The Late 1960S. And He Was Always Coming From A Different Perspective. He Came From A Different Wavelength Than The Other Students. So, I Sort Of Took To Him, In Any Event. I Got To Know Him That Way. A Lot Of People Thought He Looked Like A Hick. He'd Sort Of Slouch When He Walked, And He Didn't Care How He Dressed. He Had No Money, Or Very Little. And, In Order To Generate Some Income, He Would Pick Up Documents That Had To Be Delivered The Next Day In Los Angeles. He Would Take The Last Plane Out Of San Francisco, Get The First Plane Back In The Morning, Get To San Francisco At 8:00, And Go To Class. He Did That Five Nights A Week. And That's How He Got The Idea. I Remember Him Telling Me That He Was Forming A Company. I Remember It Very Well. Take Yourself Back To The Middle 1960S. There Were No Faxes, There Was Certainly No Email. And If You Had To Have A Signed Contract, The Only Way To Get It Was In The Mail. There Certainly Wasn't Federal Express In Those Days. Dhl Started In 1969. That Was The Year Man First Walked On The Moon, The First 747 Landed... And Dhl Opened Up Business Communications Around The World. It Didn't Become An International Company Right Away. But Larry Had A Talent For Business Organization, And He Was A Major Mover, If Not The Exclusive Mover In The Whole Thing. Corral: Larry Was 26 Years Old. He Was A Very Nervous Type Of A Guy. Seemed Like He Was Always Shaking, And He Was Real, Real Shy. But He Was Brilliantly Eccentric. In The Early Days, Dhl Had A Tough Time Selling Their Service Because People, Number One, Didn't Believe We Could Do What We Were Saying. I Served As His Courier. We'd Have Free Tickets-- Two Fo Them. And We Didn't Do Anything But Check This Baggage. At One Point, The Fbi Came In And Met With Larry Because They Were Investigating Why We Were Giving Away Free Tickets. So, Then The Fbi Became Couriers For Us, You Know, On Their Off Time, If They Wanted To Go On Vacation. Ha! The United States Postal Service Started Giving Dhl Some Trouble, Alleging That The Documents That We Were Carrying Was Really First-Class Mail. It's Hard To Understand Today, But Back Then, There Was One Mail Service, And They Had A Monopoly. Larry Sued The Post Office And Was Successful In Breaking The Monopoly In The United States. It Was Just Amazing-- Not Only For Dhl, But For Other Companies As Well. It Was The Beginning Of The Transfer Of What Was Then Documents Worldwide. First Honolulu And San Francisco, And Then It Expanded To The Far East And Places Like Abu Dhabi And Beirut. Imagine Opening Up A City In The Middle East, And They Have No Street Addresses, I Just Think He Saw The World As Small As It Really Is. ( Crowd Chattering ) You Have To Trace Today's Globalism-- The Whole Concept Of Globalism--To Larry Hillblom. Larry Created An Industry That Had A Huge Impact On The World. ( Airplane Engine Roaring ) Manso: So, What We're Talking About Is A Terribly Inventive Guy, A Terribly Ambitious Guy. You Would Expect A Very A Carefully Drawn-Up Will-- All The Is Dotted, The Ts Crossed, And So Forth-- And That Appears Not To Have Been The Case Here. Larry Hillblom's Estate Was Not In Tip-Top Shape At The Time Of His Death. The Lion's Share Of The Money Was Left To Medical Research. But There Were Holes In This Thing. It Said Nothing About Any Kids. The Only Surprising Thing Was That Larry Was An Attorney, And Yet Larry Left Out The Possibility Of Any Progeny In His Will. Any Attorney Will Tell You That If You Put Progeny, Or The Possibility Of Offspring, In The Will, And Then Either Give Them Nothing Or Give Them Very Little, You've Covered That Possibility. Larry Just Didn't Do That. And That's When The Trouble Started. Good Evening, And Thank You For Joining Us. I'm Travis Kauffman. And I'm Debra Lee. An 11-Year Palauan Boy Is Claiming To Be The Sole Heir To The Hillblom Empire. Today In Superior Court, The Child's Mother, Kaelani Kinney, Claims She Had Sexual Relations With Larry Hillblom. She Got Pregnant And Had A Child. His Name Is Junior Larry Hillbroom. He's 11 Years Old. Kaelani Kinney Claims He Was Actually Hillblom's Illegitimate Son. If They Can Prove That In Court, He Would Become One Of The Richest Little Boys In The Entire World. Manso: The Claimants Were Going Up Against The Representatives Of The Estate. Larry's Business Lawyer, Donnici, Was Running The Trust For Medical Research. Chairman Of The Charitable Trust, Peter Donnici, Propelled The Image Of A Money-Grubbing Woman Out On The Take, To Take Advantage Of A Dead Man's Estate. And Larry Had Signed The Bank Of Saipan As The Executor, Or The Manager, Of His Assets. The Bank's Front Guy Was Joe Waechter. Joe Waechter, Executor Of The Estate, Denied Larry Hillblom Had Illegitimate Children. I Don't Know Whose Kid This Is, But It's Definitely Not Larry Hillblom's. The Responsible Thing Would've Been To Turn To The Claimants And Say, "Look, Maybe They Are, Maybe They Aren't Larry's Kids. Let's Find Out." That Would've Been The Correct Response For Them To Make. They Didn't Want To Do It. Joe Waechter Was A Longtime Friend And Business Manager For Larry. Waechter Had Started With Dhl Early In The Dhl Days, Ran Dhl United States For A While. And Peter Donnici Had Helped Out Larry Tremendously In The Early Days Of Dhl. Donnici Pretty Much Became The Lawyer For Dhl. There Was No Direct Gift To Joe Waechter Or Pete Donnici. So, I'm Sure There Was Jealousy And Resentment. Why Should These Women Make So Much Money, Yet They Get Nothing? It Was Altogether In Their Interest To Preserve That Money, Because The Trustees Are Legally Entitled To A Percent Of Income Generated By Assets. If You're Administering A Billion-Dollar Trust, This Is Not Small Potatoes Where I Come From. This Is Real Money. Good Evening. Welcome To Island Focus. I'm Grace Lee. In A Way, The Death Of Late Billionaire Larry Hillblom Remains Open-Ended, His Body Never Recovered. And So It Is With The Court Case Over The Distribution Over His Massive Estate. There Is An Ongoing Battle To Keep The Kids From Getting Any Money. The Hinge On Which The Whole Drama Turned Is The Entry Of Lujan. I Came Into The Case To Represent Junior Hillbroom. I've Never Held Myself Up As A-- As An Intellectual Lawyer. Give Me The Facts, And I'll Argue. If It's Red, And You Want It To Look Green, Then, You Know, We'll Make It Look Green. The Hillblom Case Was My First Big Public Case. And David Asked If I Would Be Interested In Coming Into The Case. And I Said That I Was, For Sure. David Told Me It Was Larry's Kid, And I Believe Him. Newscaster: Donnici Called Junior Larry Hillbroom's Attorneys "Greedy Lawyers, Trying To Line Their Pockets With The Late Billionaire's Money." Probably This Is An Attempt To Extort From An Estate, Trying To Force Us To Settle So That They Can Get Some Money Quickly, Without Working For It. Lujan: I Saw It, As A Lawyer, That I Was Representing Someone Who Was, Frankly, A Helpless Kid. Lujan Is David Going Up Against A Goliath. You Have The San Francisco People Thinking That, You Know, They'll Be Able To Do What They Want In Saipan. There Was No One To Stop Them Or Stand In Their Way. Dotts: There's Actually Always Been A History Of That, That The People On The Island Sleep Under Coconut Trees And Really Don't Know Anything About The Law. So, Quite Often, Attorneys Arrive From Off-Island To Kind Of Teach Us The Way Things Work. The Worst Thing Anyone Can Do In Battle Is To Think, You Know, That You're Smarter Than The Other Guy. The Whole Case Gets Chaotic. It Goes Back To, You Know, The Very Fugitive Nature Of Larry's Existence. Why Didn't Larry Leave A Very Tidy Estate? There Are Mysteries To This Story That Do Not Go Away. Larry Was Scared Of Dying. Larry Didn't Want To Die At A Young Age, And He Deliberately Was Careful About The Food He Ate, And He Would Eat All Sorts Of Things To Lower Cholesterol, And He Would Not Smoke. And When He Reached The Age Of 51, I Think It Was, He Said, "You Know, I've Reached The Magic Age. "A Lot Of Men Die Before They Get To This Age "From Strokes And Heart Attacks. "And If You Can Get To This Age, You'll Probably Live To Be An Old Man." Larry Was Not A Daredevil At All, Except Flying Airplanes. It Was A Test That Wasn't Passed. Well-Known Businessman Larry Hillblom Was Trying Out A New Engine On His Airplane. Something Went Wrong Just Before It Crashed On Tinian Yesterday Afternoon. Although There Were Deep Gashes To His Face, Hillblom Suffered No Brain Damage. However, He Will Need Major Facial Reconstructive Surgery. Man: Larry Was Certainly Conscious When He Arrived. He'd Obviously Had A Lot Of Facial Asymmetry Because Of The Injuries, Which Were Primarily On The Right Side Of His Face. Basically-- And This Is A Human Skull-- It Involved This Part Of The Face. The Scrub Nurse-- The Person Who Hands You Your Instruments-- Said, "I Don't Think I've Ever Seen Anybody Have This Many Plates And Screws In Them In My Life." We Had That Many Fractures To Put Back Together. The Healing Proceeded Perfectly Normally. So, What Happened And When It Happened-- We Can Never Put It Together. We Realized He Wasn't Seeing In The Right Eye. It Was Very-- It Was A Huge Disappointment To Both Of Us-- I'm Sure Particularly To Larry. Man: The Reconstructive Surgery Made His Face Look A Little Bit Unreal. Regarding That Accident, Has There Been Any Follow-Up With The F.A.A. About Your Licensability To Fly In That Plane? Yeah, But That Had Nothing To Do With The Accident. The Accident Is An Accident Question, And I Don't Think The F.A.A. Ever Found The Cause. I Mean, We're Pretty Sure What Happened Was That, Uh, The Carburetor-- Something Was Wrong With The Carburetor, And It Came Out At 200 Feet. And Actually, What I Heard From The F.A.A. Is I Did Everything Right. I Shut The Fuel Off, I Shut The Master Switch Off. It Was A Pretty Good Crash Landing, As Far As Crash Landings Go. That Covers The Accident. How About The Question Of Whether You Were Licensed To Be Flying The Plane At The Time? Has There Been Any Follow-Up On That? Well, There Hasn't Been Any Follow-Up Now, But There Is No Follow Up. I Mean, You-- When You're Not Licensed, You're Not Supposed To Fly, But That's It. I Mean, Uh... The Sort Of Bittersweet Comment That Stuck In My Mind-- Larry Says, "Well, Now I Never Have To Worry About Another Airplane Crash, "Because The Odds Of Getting Into Two Airplane Crashes In One's Lifetime "Is So Remote That It's Never Gonna Happen. It's Never Anything I Have To Worry About." When I Was First Approached About The Case, I Had A-- You Know, I Had An Idea About This Claim. When Larry Was Alive, I Would Run Into Larry All The Time. Everyone Would Tease Larry In Front Of Me, That He's Got A Kid. And Of Course I Just Kept My Mouth Shut. You Know, But My Mind's Registering All This. Larry Denied It. But When He Would Leave, I Would Ask, "Is That True?" And They'd Say, "Yeah, He's Got A Boy Down There." Dotts: There's Always Been A Rumor About The Boy From Palau. Larry Had Been In Palau, And He Had Met Kaelani Kinney, And They Had Had Basically A One-Night Relationship. Lujan: And The Boy Grew Up In His Grandmother's House. With A Picture Of Larry. "That's Your Father." "He's Not My Kid. It Belongs To Somebody Else." He And I Were Good Friends, And One Day I Did Ask Him. I Said, "Larry, Just Between You And Me-- "I Promise I Won't Tell Anybody-- Are You His Father?" I Promised I Wouldn't Tell Anyone. ( Laughs ) In The Old Days, Guess What The Best Proof Was? Bringing The Child In And Showing The Judge How The Boy Looks-- You Know, Spitting Image Of The Father. Jones: It Was An Odd Situation In That There Was No Body Found For Larry To Obtain Dna. Larry Just Disappeared. He Only Body That Wasn't Found Was Larry's. You Would Think That Someone Like Him-- When This Guy Fosset Disappeared, They Searched Everywhere. They Spent A Fortune Looking For Him. When Larry Disappeared, The Search Was Stopped Very Quickly. I Think They Didn't Want To Find His Body Because They Knew That There Was A Child Out There. You Find The Body, You Find Dna. Dotts: That Day, Larry Was Flying To The Northern Islands. So, They Were Not That Far Away. And No Word Came From Them, No Cell Phone Calls, Not Distress Beacon, Nothing. First Of All, We Had To Prove That The Boy Was Hillblom's Child. Right? So, That Was Goal Number One. The Obvious Way To Solve The Case Is To Get Blood Samples From Hillblom's Relatives. That Would've Had A Good Chance Of Solving The Problem, You Know, In Two Days. They Refused, And There Was No Way To Force Them To Do It. In A Case, What You Have To Hope For Is That You Can Find Some Biological Material That The Circumstances Would Suggest Are From The Person You're Interested In-- Hair Or Blood, Or Maybe Semen. That Kind Of Evidence Can Be Found In Residences Where People Live. Newscaster: The Attorney For Junior Larry Hillblom The Court Last Week Ordered The Estate Executor, Joe Waechter, Not To Clean Or Disturb Anything In The House. Lujan: We Went And Searched Hillblom's House For The Dna. There's Not A Single Thing. Not A Picture, Not A Comb, Not An Underwear-- Nothing Of Larry Hillblom's. I Was Surprised That Everything Seemed To Be Very Clean At That Time. There Was No Dirty Clothes In The Corner. It Seemed Like A Place That Had Been Maintained In A Very Neat And Clean State All The Time. It Didn't Bode Well For Finding The Kind Of Evidence We Were Looking For. We Dug Through Bathtub Drains And Sink Drains, And Typically, Hair Gets Caught Up In Those Things. It's The Cleanest Pipe He's Ever Seen In His Life. I Remember Him Telling Me He Was Looking Around His Bathroom As He Was-- You Know, How Clean Bathrooms Are Normally In Hotels, Because Every Day, They Clean It. He Said Hillblom's Pipe Was Cleaned. But That's What An Investigation Is All About. There Are More False Trails In Any Investigation Than There Are Fruitful Ones. Um...What We Found Out Later About What Happened Was... You Know, Sort Of-- It Made A Lot Of Sense. But I Wasn't Suspicious, Really, Before That That Anything Strange Had Gone On. All My Instincts As A Criminal Lawyer-- You Know, The Radars, Everything, Red Flags, You Know-- Are Flying All Over. At The Time Of Hillblom's Death, Larry Was Living With A Girl Named Josephine Norcasa. She Was Larry's Live-In Girlfriend, And She Had Made A Claim Also Against The Estate. O'connor: I Was With Him When He Met Josephine, And He Was Just Instantly Smitten With Josephine. I Couldn't See Why, Because Josephine Didn't Speak Much English, And All She Said Was, "No. No. No." Every Question--"No." ( Laughs ) And I Thought, "Jeez, Larry, Why Are You Wasting Your Time With This Girl?" But There Was Something About Her That Just Struck Him, And They Were Instantly Inseparable. Always Held Her In A Higher Level Than The Other Girls. I Even Told Josephine, "You're One Of A Kind That I Think Larry Has Feelings For." And She Even Told Me-- She Said, "Really?" I Said, "I Absolutely Believe That There's Something That Clicked With You And Larry." She Was Jealous, And She Suspected Larry Of Seeing Women Behind Her Back. So, She Used A Black Marker, And She Wrote "Josephine" On All Of His Underwear. So, He Had Underwear That Said "Josephine". ( Laughs ) Larry Actually Had A Couple Of Passports. So, The Passport That She Would Look At When He Got Back On Saipan Wasn't The Passport He Was Using To Check Into Different Ports Of The World. It's Not Wise On A Small Island To Cheat. So, That Was The Reason Not To Go Out To The Bars On Saipan. Anderson: He Liked To Travel Around To The Hotspots Of Asia. He Enjoyed Having A Good Time. After Larry's First Accident, Josephine Wrote Up A Will, And She Tried To Get Larry To Sign It. That If He Signed The Will, Then She Might Want Him Dead, And He Wanted Her To Be Concerned About His Well-Being, And So He Refused To Sign The Will. After Larry Disappeared, She Was Still Living In The House. She Was Very Broken Up. She Didn't Know What To Do. She Lived With Larry For Ten Years, But She Really Had No Money Of Her Own. She Knew All Of Larry's Friends, And Joe Waechter Was A Close Friend Of Larry's. What I Was Hearing From Joe Waechter Is That They Were Gonna Do The Right Thing By Josephine, That I Shouldn't Worry, They Were Gonna Do The Right Thing By Josephine. But Nothing Ever Happened. I Got Involved Representing Josephine, And I Started Hearing, "Josephine's Just A Maid. "She's Got A Contract Approved By The Department Of Labor. She's Just The Housekeeper." Anderson: Josephine-- That Was A Real Tragedy. She Was The One Who Was Suddenly Left With Nothing. And I Think People On Saipan Actually Felt Sorry For Her. It Was Kind Of-- "Ignore Reality, Create A Story, And Then Sell The Story." So, The Story Is, Josephine's A Maid, These Are Prostitutes Who Are Making It Up. It Wasn't Really Larry They Had Been With. Manso: Young Girls-- Most Of Them Filipinos-- Claiming That Larry Was The Father Of Their Children-- Were Poor, Uneducated, And Rootless, With No Connections. And They Simply Didn't Have Many Options. There Was Kind Of An Elitist, And Also, To A Degree, Racist Attitude. A Poor Lady From The Philippines-- Why In The World Would She Need $40 Million? Why Should We Give Somebody Like This So Much Of The Money? Calvo: The Heir Claimants Had Everything To Fight For, One Of Those Kids Was Sleeping In A Cardboard Box. Dotts: In The Philippines, There Is A Very Big Divide Between People Who Have Money And People Who Don't Have Money. The Poor People In The Philippines Tend To Be Very Poor, To The Point Where There's Still Starvation, There's Serious Malnutrition, Children Don't Go To School. So, What Often Happens In The Philippines Is, Some Daughters Will Work For The Bar Industry To Help Provide Money To The Family. Jones: As Far As I Know, When They Get To Be The Age Of Physical Consent-- I Don't Know Legally. These Girls Were 13, 14 Years Old. I Think Probably The Proper Term Is "Puberty". The Parents Would Sell Them To Some Agent, Who Would Bring Them To A Bar To Work And Make Money As Prostitutes. I Don't Remember Anybody Ever Saying, "What Can We Do For These Children? How Can We Do The Right Thing For The Kids?" No One Ever Said That. People Thought That These Kids Didn't Deserve Any Of The Money. We Had People Tell Us That, You Know, "Why Should A Filipino Kid Be Rich "Because Of Larry Hillblom, When We're Going To Spend The Money On The Noble Cause Of Medical Research?" Lujan: "Wouldn't This Money Be Better Served "By Being Spent In The United States? Why Should They Get All Of This Money?" My Answer Was Simply, "Because They're Hillblom's Kids." As Simple As That. The Law Allows It. ( Children Chattering ) Israel: And I Don't Think That They Really Looked Upon These Kids As Real People. In That Part Of The World, People Take Care Of Their Families. If They Can't Take Care Of A Kid, They'll Ask Another Relative To Take Care Of The Child. After The Rumors Started Surfacing About Junior Hillbroom, Peter Donnici Advised Larry On Numerous Occasions-- "You've Got To Revise Your Will." And He Refused. Dotts: There Was Some Speculation That Larry Knew That He Had Kids, And He Meant Not To Have His Kids Disinherited. Larry Himself, In His Role As Special Judge In The Saipan High Court, Participated In Writing An Opinion Which Firmly Established As Law The Inheritance Rights Of Children Born Out Of Wedlock. I Mean, It's Almost As If He Were Writing Law That Addressed His Particular Situation. Lujan: I Have To Believe That He Didn't Want To Disinherit His Kids, At Least Not Then And There. The People On The Other Side, They Said They Had To Find Another Way I'll Tell You Why I Really Went After Them, Okay? 'Cause They Treated Me Like Shit. We Had A Meeting In San Francisco, And We Were At Peter Donnici's Office. We Came To An Agreement That, On The Following Week, They'll Give Us An Offer In Writing. And I Remember Going Up To Saipan On Monday. And After The Hearing, I Asked, "Do You Think I Should Fly Home Or Just Stay Here And Wait For The Offer?" He Says, "Dave, Why Don't You Hang Around? The Offer's Coming." Tuesday, Called Him Up. "The Offer Here?" "No." So, Wednesday--No Offer. Thursday-- I Said, "I'd Better Go Home, And I Can Come Back When You Have It." He Said, "No, Dave, Why Don't You Hang Around?" "Okay." "Joe Waechter's Coming In This Evening." So, Friday Morning, I Go Out There At About 10:00. He Sent His Associate Partner, One Of Them, Who Came Out And Said, "Oh, We Decided There's No Offer." So, I Said, "Okay." And I'll Tell You This-- I Swear To God-- That's What This Is-- Personally, For Me, That's What This Was All About. Just For That. That's When I Went After Them. And I Said, "I'll Teach Them A Lesson." They Should've Given Me The Offer. I Would've Been Lazy. ( Chuckles ) Newscaster: The Attorney For Would-Be Heir, Junior Larry Hillbroom, Questions The Motives Of Executor Joe Waechter, Hillblom Trust Chairman Peter Donnici, And He Started Picking Apart The Way Joe Waechter Got Control Of The Estate. I Asked The Judge For Them To Produce Certain Things. So, They Stood Up And Said, "Oh, Your Honor, No Problem. We'll Give It To Him Tomorrow." There Was A Stack This High Of Documents, You Know? All These Loan Agreements And Mortgages And Everything. So, They Said, "Here It Is, Dave. "You Know, It's A Lot." "So, What Do You Want To Do?" I Said, "I'll Tell You What-- "Why Don't You Just Leave It, And We'll Meet Back Here At 4:00." He Says, "Oh, You're Gonna Go?" I Said, "No, I'm Gonna Stay Here And Read It." And I Remember-- Because I With Joe Hill, And Joe Hill Told Me Afterwards, "You Should've Seen Their Face." Because Joe Believed They Never Expected That I Would Sit Down And Read Everything, Which I Did. I Read Everything That I Could, You Know? And The Next Day, I Went To Court And Told The Judge, "Guess What, Judge? They're Stealing. They're Engaging In All Kinds Of Conflicts." Manso: Right After Larry's Disappearance, Donnici And Waechter Swoop In And Take Over The Bank Of Saipan, Which Larry Had Assigned To Oversee His Estate. It's The Most Extraordinary Thing. It Happened With Such Alacrity They Borrowed Money From The Estate To Pay For The Stock In The Bank, And That Is Wrong On So Many Different Levels. But That's What They Did. So, I Come To You, And I Say, "Let Me Buy 40% Of You, But Lend Me The Money To Buy It From You." Okay? Because That's Exactly What Happened. The Plan Clearly Was To Take Over The Bank, Which Would Then Allow Them To Take Over The Assets. Newscaster: The Judge's Order To Kick Joe Waechter Off The Hillblom Case-- Waechter Was Managing The Affairs Of The Hillblom Estate Until The Bank Was Suspended. Without Lujan, They Probably Would Have Gotten Away With It. We Thought We Were Being Retained To Prove That Junior Was Larry's Son. But When We Saw What Was Going On, We Realized That We Had To Function As The Executor And Save The Assets. The Way Hillblom Did Business Was Very Convoluted. In Vietnam, He Put All That Money In, And His Name Wasn't On Any Documents. He Put In About 102 Million Into Vietnam. I've Been Through All The Corporate Records Of The Company In Vietnam. I've Been Through The Minutes Of Every Meeting, Going Back To 1992. We Know He Was There. But His Name Doesn't Appear In Any Document. He Had To Do It That Way Because He Was There Pre-Embargo. Americans Weren't Allowed To Invest Money In Vietnam. The Justice Department Sent Him A Letter, Asking To Know What He Was Doing In Vietnam, And He Wrote "Fuck You" On The Letter And Sent It Back To The Attorney General. Just A Week Ago, I Found Out There's Another $40,000 That Belongs To The Estate In Hong Kong. It Just Keeps Coming Up. When He Died, I Found Out That He Had Left A $3 Million Apartment Complex On Saipan In My Name. So, I Could've Said, "I'm Keeping It. It's In My Name." But I Didn't. I Gave It Back To Them. The One Important Ingredient, In Part, To Keeping His Estate Together, Uh, Was Larry. No One Else Could've Done It. There Was No Rhyme Or Reason To The Empire That He Built. Hillblom And His Friends Was Like An Octopus, And Larry Was The Head. And All These Guys That Worked For Him Were Nothing But Tentacles. And When Larry Died, You Know, It Was Like The Head Had Been Cut Off, O'connor: He Was Careful With His Friends. So, Most Of The People Who Were Friends With Larry Were Friends Inside Of A Box. They Were His Friend With Regard To A Federal Takeover Issue. They Were His Friend With Regard To Taxation. They Were His Friend With Regard To Chasing Girls. He Didn't Want People To Have A Good Handle On Him. He Recognized People Thought He Was Crazy And Unpredictable, That That Gave Him An Advantage. He Truly Enjoyed His Privacy. He Had People Work For Him That Were On The Cover Of Forbes, But It Was Never Him. He Liked His Anonymity. I Think He Was Counting On The Fact That Nobody Really Knew Who He Was. ( Water Splashes ) After Waechter Is Tossed Off The Estate, After The Ploy That He Attempted To Pull Off With The Bank-- The Takeover Of The Bank-- Somehow, The State Attorney General From California Gets Pulled Into The Case To Reinforce Donnici And Waechter. God Knows What The Back Channels Might Have Been. There Was So Much Money In Larry's Estate, And There Were, Um-- The Lifestyles Of The People That Made Claims Were Such That, Uh... Anything That They Could Shake Out Of An Estate As Large As This Would Be A Great Boon To Them. There Was A Great Deal Of Opportunism There. Why Would The Attorney General Of California Get Involved With This Thing? Well, The University Of California Had Been Designated In Larry's Will As The Beneficiary Of Larry's Estate. There's A Billion Dollars Riding On This Thing. When Peter Donnici Reached Out To The Attorney General Of California, We Thought That We Could Just Go In And Educate Them That-- "Look, If There's All This Wrongdoing Going On, "You Guys Are On The Wrong Side Here. "We're Trying To Protect The Assets, And You Ought To Be In There Helping Us." Well, That Was Completely Naive, Because Of The State Of California's Financial Interest In The Estate. The Reaction Was, "What's Next?" Manso: Then It Became A Frenzied Fight To Hang On To Something. The Lawyers Then Descended. Peter Donnici Went And Hired A Big-Time Law Firm To Represent The Hillblom Trust. And Then The Assets Themselves-- They Hired Their Own Lawyers-- Law Firms From California, L.A., New York. Dotts: It Turned Into A Real Circus, With Dozens Of Attorneys And Hearings Several Times A Week. Israel: It Overwhelmed Our Judicial System. This Was The Biggest Thing That's Ever Happened In Saipan, For Sure. Some Of These Law Firms Were Billing The Estate 1 Million A Month. 1 Million A Month. Imagine That. ( Chuckles ) They Came To This Tiny Island In The Middle Of The Pacific Involving Lawyers That Were Not Of Their Ilk. We Had A Very, Very Colorful Opposing Counsel, By The Name Of Mr. Lujan. I Remember His First Appearance. I Was Watching Him-- "This Man Reminds Me Of A Snake." And We Know What To Do With Snakes In Guam. We Cut Their Head Off With Machetes. He And I Butted Heads At Every Turn. A Criminal Lawyer Learns To Utilize Theatrics. That's Why I Call Him The Rooster. The First Meeting With Mr. Lujan Was In Some Very Provocative Court Appearance, Where He Filed A Challenge Suggesting That The Judge Himself Might Have Illegitimate Children And Shouldn't Sit In The Case. And I At Least Had Never Accused A Judge, Without Supporting Evidence, Of Having Illegitimate Children, And I Realized I Was Now In A Different Jurisdiction. One Of The Trust Lawyers One Day, You Know, Was Wandering Around The Courtroom, And He Was Kind Of A Corpulent Guy, And He Had His Stomach In Between David Lujan And David's Line Of Vision In Cross-Examining A Witness. So, David Stood Up And, In His Very Courtly Courtroom Tone, Said... "Your Honor, He's Doing It Again. "His Big Stomach Is Blocking Me. Can You Tell Him To Remove That Big Stomach?" Things Aren't Always What They Appear To Be. We Got Some Background Materials About Larry Hillblom As We Dug Deeper And Deeper, And It Became Very Fascinating. And... We Had An Interesting Time With It, Given The Facts Surrounding Larry's Life. Larry Was A Colorful And Interesting Character. He Found Adventure In Places Where Few Of Us Look For It. Kennedy: A Local Counsel In The Philippines Gave Me A Tour Of Larry Hillblom's Manila. The Clubs Were Unbelievable. 300 Or 400 Or 500 Women In Them Who Were Classified Either As "Dancers", "Nude Dancers", Or "Guest Relations Officers"-- G.R.O.'S-- Which I Thought Was The Most Formalistic Title I'd Ever Heard For A Hooker. Apallas: When I Interviewed One Of The Ladies In Charge Of A Bar That He Frequented, She Told Me, When Larry Would Come In, She Would Arrange Young Girls, Ten Across. Larry Would Look At The Young Ladies And... Either Choose One Or Decline The Entire Line, And Then They Would Step To The Back, And A New Line Would Come Up. He Was Always Interested In Young Ladies That Were From The Farm, People From The Back Parts Of The Philippines Or Palau-- Virgins. And I Asked The Mama-San, "How Could He Possibly Know That?" She Said, "Well, He Would Take Them To The Hotel And Show Them To The Shower." ( Elevator Dings ) If, In Fact, They Knew How To Operate A Shower, He Knew That They Obviously Were In The Facility-- Or A Facility Similar To That--Before. So, Therefore, He Would Eliminate Them. Choper: He Told Me About His Relationships With Women, And He Explained That He Would Only Have Sex With Virgins Because He Didn't Want To Get Aids. So, He Went Into A Long Explanation Of The Millions Of Dollars That This Had Cost Him. I Forget The Details, But I Know He Said "Millions". In One Of The Depositions, I Understand, One Of The Young Ladies Testified About How Larry Would Take A Spoonful Of Iodine Or Some Other... Um, Chemical... And Would Pour It Down His... Penis... In Order To Kill Any Germs That He Might-- He Never-- He Never, I Am Told, Enjoyed Sex With A Prophylactic, And Therefore He Had To Take Certain Precautions To Prevent From Getting A Disease. It Was The Philippines That Really Bothered Me With Up-Front Exposure To What Poverty Requires People To Do And The Just Plain Sinfulness Of Westerners Taking Advantage Of That. It's Appalling. We're Talking About People Who Are Living By Something Other Than A 20Th Century American Morality. It All Was Kind Of Shocking. Uh... ( Laughs ) I Have A Lot Of Newspapers, Do You? No. Everybody Makes A Mistake. You Would Hear Things, And None Of It Was Good. I Was A Little Puzzled, Uh... That He Had That Need. Uh, He Had A Girlfriend-- Josephine-- And She Was Very Attractive. I Just Couldn't Understand Why He'd Be Off Somewhere Else When She Was There At Home. And, Uh... Dotts: He Didn't Cover Up His Lifestyle. I Remember Him Talking To An Executive With Continental Airlines About How Many Girlfriends He Had, And The Guy Should Consider Doing The Same Thing-- "Come On To The Philippines. I'll Introduce You. We Can Find You A Girlfriend, No Problem." And The Guy Was Just So Uncomfortable With The Conversation, And Larry Kept Going Just, I Think, To Goad The Guy. Those Of Us Who Are Educated And, You Know, Comfortable In This Country Affect Great Shock That American Business In The Philippines Are Being Serviced In Precisely The Same Way, With The Encouragement Of Local Officials, Businesspeople, And Government Officials. It Is Not An Unusual Thing. The System Is There-- Was There Before He Came Along, Is There After He's Gone. And There's Still Thousands Of Girls Working In Dingy Little Brothels, Trying To Work Off Money That Was Given To Their Parents. Dotts: The First Bit Of Paranoia-- One Of The Mothers In The Philippines One Day Disappeared. There Were People Who Were Looking For Potential Heirs That They Could Represent In Saipan. Private Detectives Were Hired, And The Word Was Put Out. They Went To Bars And Posted Sign That-- If You Know This Man, You Might Get A Lot Of Money. One Of The Investigators Found Mercedes, Who Was, At The Time, Pregnant. Dotts: The Private Investigator Was Holding Her Hostage. Manlapaz: This Was Just A 14-Year-Old. She Was Eight Months Pregnant At The Time. They Wanted Her To Be Brought To Saipan. But, Before Doing That, The Child Was Asked To Undergo A Caesarian Operation Instead Of Going Through A Normal Delivery. There Was A Deadline Coming Up For Claims, And They Wanted The Baby Born Before The Deadline. They Wanted To Make Sure That The Kid That She Was Carrying At The Time Would, You Know, Have These Caucasian Features, Or At Least Look Like Larry. We Were Able To Rescue Her From That House. She Wasn't Even Aware That Larry Was Dead At That Time. And, According To Her, She Was Waiting For Larry, Because Larry Promised To Come Back And, According To Her, Marry Her. So, We Asked Her If She Was Really Carrying The Child Of Larry, And She Said She Was Positive. We Also Felt Threatened. You're Just In Time For The Most Informative Half-Hour Of Your Day. Here's What's Ahead. With His Claim Against The Hillblom Estate, Junior Larry Hillbroom Will Have Quite A Tale To Tell His Own Kids. But, For All The Arguing, All The Hearings, All The Publicity, Not One Shred Of Evidence Has Been Put Before The Court To Prove These Children Either Are Or Are Not Children Of Larry Hillblom. At That Point, The Only Thing We Had Done Is Preserve The Assets. We Had Made No Progress In Demonstrating Paternity. And Then, Out Of Nowhere, Pops Up Larry Hillblom Dna. Someway, Somehow, We Found Out That There Was A Mole That Was Excised From Larry's Face When He Had Some Reconstructive Surgery. Now, What Happened To That Mole Is Another Story. We Knew That That Was An Important Piece Of Evidence That Could Either Make Or Break The Case Of The Children-- Alleged Children. Agreed That We Would Try To Dna Out Of It. Israel: The Deposition Was Scheduled, And The Doctor Walked In. He Reached Into His Pocket And Threw It On The Table. It Was Like It Wasn't Even Real, Like It Was A Joke. Every Time We Turned Around, There Was Somebody With A Conflict Of Interest Working Against Us. The Davies Medical Center Stood To Benefit From The Money Coming Out Of The Foundation. You Know, For All We Know, They'll Put Someone In There, So That Way, For Sure, It's Gonna Come Up That They Don't Match. Was That Their Motivation? I Don't Know. But It Sure Looked Like It To Us. So, Of Course We Were All Suspicious. We Were Scared Of That. ( Laughs ) We Didn't Want Anything To Do With It. So, It Was Never Opened. I'm Just A Naive Scientist. I Don't Understand All These, Uh... Derring-Do Plots And Intrigues. You Couldn't Help But Be Angry Because Of The Constant Assault, You Know? They Were Constantly, Constantly, Trying To Screw You. They Wake Up One Morning, And There's A New Law In Place. It Was Known As The "Hillblom Law", And This Law Was Very Simple. It Disinherited Illegitimate Children. And The Whole Thing Had Been Engineered By Donnici And Company. Newscaster: The Former Executor Of The Hillblom Estate Admitted From The Start That The Bill To Change The Probate Law Began With Him. The Hillblom Law Was Checkmate For The Children, And It Applied Retroactively. It's Unprecedented. We're Talking About A Whole Bunch Of Things That Never Happened Before In The History Of The World, Including Anything Like The Hillblom Law. Everything Is Not Surprising... Everything Is Possible In Saipan. ...And Possible In Saipan. Dotts: There Were Suspicions That Perhaps The Hillblom Bill Passed By Bribery. At That Time, There Were Promises Of Donations By The Trust, Raising Red Flags. An Enormous Setback To The Plaintiffs. Pete Donnici, Joe Waechter-- They Were So Taken Up With The Fight Which Really Means, "How Can We Disinherit Larry's Son?" Which Is Not The Right Thing To Do. Disinheriting Children Is Not The Right Thing. I Don't Think That Larry's Friends Looked At What The Implications Would Be Of Some Law Like That For Other People On The Island. What We're Talking About Is The Phenomenon Of The Ugly American. I Mean, Americans Taking Advantage Of Locals. With Our Money, With Our Clout, We've Got The Power, They Don't Have Anything. Boom. You Know, I've Represented Murderers And Rapists And... All Kinds Of, You Know, People Accused Of... Various, You Know, Heinous Crimes. I Just Thought These People Were Worse. Because These Are Supposedly Intelligent People, And People, You Know, That Were Businessmen, People That Are Held Up As Upright Members Of The Community And All Those Things. You Know, It Was Disgusting. How Do You Overcome This? Here, By This Time, We're Into It Pretty Deeply, And We Were Pretty Much Out Of Money. ( Gavel Pounds ) Lujan Should Have Lost It All, But These Guys Simply Won't Take No For An Answer. It Was Kind Of The Final Straw, I Suppose. It Was Thermonuclear War After That. I Went After Them With A Vengeance. ( Train Horn Sounds ) Dotts: There Was A Rumor That Larry's Mother Had Been Hospitalized Because Of High Blood Pressure, And A Nurse Had Come Into Her Room And Taken A Swab Of The Inside Of Her Cheek. And Then She Later Asked Somebody, "Why Did They Do That?" And They Checked The Records, And There Was No Record Of Any Nurse Having Come Into Her Room And Taken A Sample Of The Inside Of Her Cheek. Taking A Sample Of The Inside Of The Cheek Is A Very Typical Way Of Getting A Dna Sample, It's A Very Easy Way To Get A Dna Sample. And It Was David-- The One Who Was Accused-- The Group Of David Lujan-- Who Was Accused Of Doing That. But, Of Course, They Denied It. There's Some Accusations Made. Shortly After That Incident Happened, David Lujan Announced That-- That He Knew, To A Scientific Certainty, That Junior Was Larry's Child. But He Refused To Say How He Knew. I Felt That We Could Win This, No Matter What The Inheritance Law Said. We Wanted To Pound Them, Beat Them, Destroy Them, So That They're Crawling To Come To The Bargaining Table. Lujan Pricks The Interest Of Nbc, And Dateline Does A Story On The Case. Businessman Larry Hillblom, Who Was Killed In A Plane Crash, Left The Bulk Of His Estate-- Hundreds Of Millions Of Dollars-- To Medical Research, But There Are Those Who Say He Left Something Else Behind. Junior, What's Your Name? Larry Hillbroom, Jr. This Palauan Boy, Called Junior Larry, Was Born Nine Months After Larry Hillblom Had Visited Palau. Kaelani, How Old Were You When You Met Larry Hillblom? 16. Is It Possible That He Slept With Kaelani Kinney? Anything Is Possible. Do You Think He Did? I Don't Know. Um... It Doesn't Seem Like She Would've Been Larry's Type. With The Dateline Exposure, Donnici Can No Longer Hide In The Shadows Of Saipan And The Philippines. It Forced Donnici To Speak. This Is Not About Trying To Keep Money Away From Children Who May Be Larry's. This Is About Greedy Lawyers. Donnici Really Feared Badly In That Interview. These Are Not The Innocent Young Virgins. These Are Experienced Bar Girls. There's Filipina Bar Girl Mercedes Feliciano. Mercedes Was Introduced To Hillblom In One Of Those Bars, Who She Says Supported Her And Her Family Until She Had Her First Period. Then He Paid Her $2,000 For Her Virginity. He Was The Only Man? That's When I Believe The Tide Started To Change. What You Have Is A National Tv Show Where The Truth Is Emerging. And Then There Was Another Bizarre Turn Of Events. Everyone Should Go To The David Lujan School Of How To Prepare A Bill, You Know, Bills That Include Their Time Charges, And They Include Their Receipts For Whatever They Spent During That Month. And David Is The One Who Found The Muriatic Acid Bill, Which Was Huge. The Estate Lawyers Submit To The Estate A Series Of Expense Accounts, And Included Here-- There It Is. Muriatic Acid? Muriatic Acid That Had Been Poured Down The Drains To Destroy Evidence. Lujan-- He'd Meticulously Go Through Bill After Bill After Bill. Well... The Devil Really Is In The Details, And David Really Knew That. Of Course, We Were So Angry When We Learned About It, Because We Spent A Lot Of Money Trying To Prove That These Kids Are Larry's Kids. These Guys-- Waechter And Donnici-- Want You To Believe That It's Just A Probate Case. It's Not A Probate Case. It's A Criminal Case. I Mean, If Nothing Else, We're Talking About An Attempt To Defraud On A Massive Scale. This Is A Felony. You Go To Jail For 15 Or 20 Years For This Kind Of Behavior. Israel: Clearly, When They Poured Acid In The Drains, They Knew That There Was A Child Out There. Otherwise, Why Would They Have Done It? Where Big Money Is Concerned, People Do Funny Things. It Was Just A Matter Of Time Before What Happened To Larry's Clothes Was Discovered Josephine Says, "Guess What, Guys? Get A Backhoe And Dig A Hole Out Behind Larry's Old House." Josephine Had Been Asked By The Executor To Destroy Evidence, And This Was At A Time Before I Represented Her. She Was Basically Asked To Take All Of Larry's Belongings-- Hairbrushes, Toothbrushes, Clothing, Anything That Would Have Dna-- And Burn It. When Joe Waechter Called Her Up And Asked Her To Do This, Josephine Kind Of Realized This May Not Be The Right Thing To Do. So, Instead Of Burning The Clothes, And Then She Reported Back To Joe Waechter That Everything Was Gone. Newscaster: According To Norcasa, The Same Man Who Denied Larry Hillblom Had Illegitimate Children Was Scrambling To Get Rid Of Evidence That There Were Any. However, Waechter Testified That It Was Norcasa Who Called Him, Asking If She Could Get Rid Of The Belongings. Waechter Testified Norcasa Got Rid Of The Belongings As Part Of Some Filipino Ritual. ( Both Laugh ) So, We Did What Was The Practical Thing To Do-- We Hired A Backhoe Operator, We Wandered Around This Big, Huge, Beautiful Property Overlooking The Bay. And We Had This Guy Dig In All These Different Places, All Of Us Standing Around In The Tropical Sun, And We Weren't Finding It. And So, Finally, This Backhoe Operator-- Said, "Well, You Want To Know Larry's Clothes Are Buried?" And We Said, "Well, Yeah." And He Said, "Well, I Know, Because I Buried Them." And So, You Know, I Thought, "Well, God... There Probably Is Only One Backhoe Operator In Saipan." He Went Right To The Place. He Dug Them Up. The Clothes, The T-Shirts, Jeans, Hairbrushes, Toothbrushes. And, You Know, It Was Just This Kind Of Real Moment Of Sadness, That, You Know, This Man Was Walking Around With These Clothes. He Was A Real Alive Person. We're Out Here, A Bunch Of-- Like Myself, Nothing But A Criminal Lawyer-- We Were Able To See Through Them And Beat Them Simply Because, You Know-- It's Not That I'm Smarter. It's That They Were Dumber. It Was Exhilarating That, After Several Years Of Fighting And Hundreds Of Lawyers From Big Cities, Against All The Odds, Against Every Odd That You Can Think Of, Our Client Was Now Going To Be Acknowledged As Larry's Son. And The Whole World Was Going To Open Up To Him In A Way That Most Of Us Can Never Experience. And We Demonstrated That We Belonged In That Courtroom. It Was A Mountain That Needed To Be Climbed. And, You Know, I Wasn't About To Give Up Until I Raised That Flag On The Top Of That Mountain. * Trouble In Mind * I'm Blue * But I Won't Be Blue * Always... It's Kind Of Ironic That, Ultimately, With All The Hue And Cry Over Larry's Dna And The Hiding Of It, And The Accusations About It, You Know, It Never Really Was Necessary. We Have A Whole Bunch Of Kids That Claim To Have The Same Father. So, Why Don't We Test The Children Themselves? And So, That's The Testing That Showed Junior, Two Filipino Kids, And A Child In Vietnam, Have The Same Father. We Used To Call It "The Lucky Sperm Club". We Became Friends With David When We Got The Results, The Dna Cross-Testing Results. He Called Us Up And Said, "We're A Family." I Wanted To Go With His Mother And See The Children. I Said, "Why Don't You And I Just Take A Trip And See The Children? I Think You--" I Thought She Would Be Anxious. But She Didn't. She, Uh, Refused To Believe It, Really. I Don't Know What It Was With Him Emotionally That He Was In Such Denial, Because They've Proven Now There Is At Least Four-- Maybe More--Kids. That Part Of Him, I Can't Understand. The Possibility Exists That He Had Set This Whole Thing Up. Larry Would've Loved The Hillblom Estate Litigation. He Liked Lawsuits, He Liked The Battle. He Was Always Getting Involved In Cases And Lawsuits And Plotting Strategies. And If He Could've-- If He Can Sit In Heaven And Look Down On The Hillblom Proceedings, He Probably Would've Enjoyed It Immensely-- The Battle That Raged Because Of How His Will Was Unclear And The Body Was Not Found. Who Knows? The Fact Is, People Say He Might Still Be Alive. Who Knows, You Know? That's Larry. He Might Show Up Somewhere. ( Laughs ) * ...Be Blue Always * 'Cause The Sun's Gonna Shine * * In My Back Door * Someday * Trouble In Mind * I'm Blue * But I Won't * Be Blue Always * 'Cause That Sun's Gonna Shine * * In My Back Door * Someday * Trouble In Mind * I'm Blue * But I Won't * Be Blue Always * 'Cause That's Sun's Gonna Shine * * On My Backdoor * Someday * Trouble In Mind * I'm Blue * But I Won't * Be Blue Always * 'Cause That Sun's Gonna Shine * * In My Back Door * Someday
