03 Cube Zero - Horror Mystery 2004 720p [H264-mp4] English I hate this place. (man breathing heavily) (door closes) (screaming) Water? Water. Water. Water. (screaming) Man: Now that is sick. Are you watching this? Second man: No, thanks. I don't look anymore. We've seen a lot, but this is just... Oh, dear god. Wow! You know, you shouldn't be looking At the files. Well, it's not against the rules. But it's not encouraged. Come on, man. We've all... It's not encouraged. OK. OK, screw this. Pawn to king 2. Knight to queen's bishop 6. Check. What? I didn't even see that. You know, I was just wondering... Um... When is chickliss coming back? Sometime this week. Probably all suntanned, the prick. Let's see... King to king's bishop 8. Rook takes queen. Check. Damn it. Damn. Sorry. Shut up. I don't need your sympathy. (pen rattles) And Owen? Where's Owen? Are you trying to psyche me out or what? I can't hear myself think. Owen is... Owen is probably out sick again. That would be my best guess. Are you sure? Yes. Yes. Despite your rather transparent tactics, brain man, Prepare to die. Bishop to queen's knight 7. Checkski. Queen takes bishop. I believe that's checkski mateski. What? No way. Aw, come on. How did you... You freak of nature! You know, the other night, I heard some noise. Noise? Yeah. In Owen's room, like a... Scuffle. Really? Yeah. You don't think that... You dreamt it. No, look... You dreamt it. You always complain about your nightmares. They come for you at night. What? They come for you at night. Who does? They do. Drop it. They do. Enough! What are you, suicidal? (clang) (ding) Ah, good. They didn't forget lunch this time. Goat-cheese salad with ginseng, Liver fricassee, and mango sorbet. Ew... Must be you. Steak frites. That's me. Hey. What? Oh. Sorry. Bless us, our lord, for these, thy gifts, Which we are about to receive from thy bounty. Through you, our lord, amen. Amen. Down the hatch. (gulp) (sighs) "please record R.E.M. Sleeper in room 172409." Let's go. OK. Zooming out of 061221 And zooming in to 1724-niner. Good. Here we go. Hot-patching gear works And flipping to R.E.M. Reader mode. Locating subject. Subject located. Zooming in. Wow. Keep your tongue in your mouth, brain man. We're on the clock. Are we locked? Sorry. Locked on. Thank you. Arm extension... Go. Calibrating. Steady. I got it. I got it. Light her up. Inter scan is locked. Commencing R.E.M. Read. Mommy! Mommy, help! Anna! (rustling) Uh! (girl screams) Anna! (anna screams) (dart fires) Uh! (typing) OK. Now let's... Cycle back. And there you have it. You do this long enough, You could do it in your sleep. Ha ha ha. In your sleep. Recording dreams in your sleep. That's funny. When's the last time you remember being outside? Uh... Last night. I had a dream about being at the beach. No, no. I mean really outside, Not a dream. I don't remember. I've been busy lately, Overloaded actually, picking up slack... For you, I might add. I don't remember, either. Isn't that weird? You're weird. Shut up and let me concentrate. (clang) Damn it. You know, I was just thinking... Stop thinking. What's gotten into you? What's gotten into me? You know who these are? Chickliss' kids... Arthur and sunshine. Orphans. They're orphans. You told me chickliss was on vacation. I have to go to the can. (beep) Try not to drool on the controls. Screws up the calibration. (click) (beep) (moans softly) Bastards. Where is she? What have you done with her? Where's... Girl's voice: Mom! What have you done to me? Why can't I remember? Why can't I remember my daughter's name? Hey. Let me go! Get off me! OK, OK. Sorry. It's OK. She's one of us. Touch me again, soldier, And you'll be eating your eyeballs. Why "soldier"? What do you know about me? Tattoo on your forehead. You're in the squads, right, killer? You show up by night, And people disappear. (spits) Why did you do that? Because you're scum. Look, miss... You have us at a disadvantage here. None of us remembers how we got here... Or pretty much anything else. Including who we are. So whatever you think you know about me... I don't even know myself. I don't trust her. She knows something. Thank god somebody does. Have you seen any children? A little girl? No. My god. I hope they don't put kids in here. That would be horrible. Why do you think there would be children in here? I've got to keep moving. Wait. You've got to be careful Climbing around here. Why? There are traps. Traps? How do you know? Because of this. That's a good bandage. You a doctor? I don't know. I did it. I might be Friggin' mother Teresa for all I know, But I don't remember. You remember something... Before all of this. Not much. Being chased through the woods By guys like you. Tattoo set me off. When I first woke up, I don't think I would have known my own name If it wasn't stitched on my shirt. I don't even know if this is my name. I feel like we've been here for hours, And I still can't remember anything! Hey, hey, hey. Give her a moment. Fine. A moment. But we've got to get moving While we still have our strength. You guys have a plan? We keep moving in the same direction Till we find the edge. This place has got to end eventually. Well, what about the traps? We test the rooms. We have a system. Safe. I'm going in. Help. Help! What kind of animals would do this? Does she look familiar to you? I keep thinking I've seen her before. Wonder what she's in for? You're making a mistake. Huh? What's the first rule I taught you about this job? Uh... Neatness counts. Very funny. Don't get involved. I know. I'm not getting involved, OK? I'm drawing. You have your chess. Owen has his fish. Chickliss has his... Could we spend 5 minutes Without bringing up Owen and chickliss, please? And get us back on real time. Gonna get us in trouble. I'll show you 3 ways to beat that game, But if you answer one question. Fine. What? OK. See, what I want to know is... Hold it. Show me. OK. Whew. Checkmate. You win. That's brilliant. Do that again. What do you know about a third exit? What? A third exit, an auxiliary exit That leads directly outside. There's no such thing. Owen said there was. He said chickliss found some old plans... They were having you on. No way. Actually... I think that's why they're gone. I think they found something out and... I think you better stop listening to old wives' tales. Just listen to me. This conversation is over. Don't you ever worry? About what? One day, you're gonna wake up inside. The only way I'm gonna wake up inside Is if I keep on talking to you. No... These things are useless! The sensors in that room must have been different. Maybe they're not motion sensors. Maybe they're triggered by heat or sound Or something. Why don't you just admit it? We're dead! He can't admit it. It's the training. The army never admits defeat. You got a problem with me, lady? Yeah. Why? I don't trust you. Man: Aw, how the hell did we miss this? What is it? "C.I.A." What is that? A clue as to who built this place? I think that's just a coincidence. Try the other doors. "Y.Y.O." "U.D.S." "S.A.N." what do they mean? I really think it's a mistake To think of these letters as meaning something. It's like some kind of code or puzzle We have to figure out. A puzzle? They're playing with us. We should make a map. Using what? Our blood? I don't know. Maybe. You got a better idea? I have a better idea. I need something. I need... You have a hairpin. They did us the favor of polishing our boots. OK. We'll flag the safe rooms. "C.I.A." Give me the others. "Y.Y.O., u.D.S.," And "s.A.N." Good memory. Yeah, in the short term. Now I wish I could remember what happened to me Between birth and about 3 hours ago. Ha ha. Right. I don't know. Shoe polish and a hairpin. Nothing in this place is random. Maybe the bastards just underestimated us. So near and yet so far. Yeah, but she's doing better than most. I mean, half of them don't even notice the letters, Let alone map them. I meant the chess. Give it up. She doesn't stand a chance. Of course she has a chance. Ha ha. Yeah? You gonna ride in on your white horse And whisk her out? The rooms could realign to zero position. Ha. No, it happens. And then she'll figure out the letters And sail through. And what's the first thing the program does When the rooms realign to zero position? A clean sweep. Exactly. Poof. The only thing that's gonna sail through that Is her ashes. Ha ha. Hey. Cheer up, buddy. They'll catch you another one. The boys upstairs like them young and pretty. Don't you ever feel guilty? Don't you ever feel? Son, you're out of line. Yeah, whatever. Excuse me? Why don't you stop your doodling And do some work for a change? Like what? We're waiting for orders. It's what we do best. It's what we do. Clean up your space. It's disgraceful. You're kidding, right? Do I look like I'm kidding? This one's "s.D.F." Wait. Wait a minute. What? I don't know if this makes any difference, But they're not periods. They're commas. He's right. They're commas. OK, so they're commas. What difference does it make? We don't even know what the letters mean yet. I mean, if they were numbers, I'd understand the commas. Haskell: Understand the commas how? Well, isn't that how you plot Coordinates on a graph... X coordinate, y coordinate, Z coordinate? Right. So if the rooms were labeled with numbers, Like 10, 1, 7... You would know something About the room's position. Yeah, but we've got letters That so far tell us absolutely nothing. That is where you're wrong, soldier. The letters tell us one important fact That numbers never would. What fact? Oh. There are only 26 letters in the English alphabet. So? So we know the parameters. Exactly. If each room has its own unique letter combination, Then it's a pretty good bet That this whole place is a cube With 26 rooms on each side. Worst-case scenario... We're anywhere From one to 25 rooms away from the edge. Let's go. Great. Actually, it's your turn to go first. "S, o, s." No kidding. Uh... I guess we'll try another way. Cassandra. The little girl's name is Anna. Protests and strikes. Troublemakers up north. The whole country's going to crap. Ungrateful pigs. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. What is it now? Please tell me that's not a... Would you put that away? There's no consent form. What? There's no pink page. The consent form's missing! So? So? You know the rules. She can't be in there without a consent form. You think they're gonna stop this whole operation Because you lost a piece of paper? I didn't lose it! Look, you know how anal these guys are. Maybe she'll get another hearing. Listen to yourself. No, but this could be huge... a mistrial. Oh, sure. Anything you say. Look... Hey! See? I told you I recognized her. Hmm. She's a political. So that would explain it. What do you mean? I mean... There might not be a consent form. Get it? But that's illegal. You know, for a child prodigy, You ain't too bright. We've got to do something. Like what? We've got to let them know upstairs. And how are we gonna do that? Call up. It's just for emergencies. Well, what do you think this is? I don't see a fire. I don't see a gas leak or flooding. I don't see you writhing on the floor In the throes of a heart attack, But, god knows, right now I'd like to! She's gonna die in there, and she's probably innocent! Hey, none of them are innocent. You read the files. You know what kind of people end up in there. Exactly! All we know is what we read in the... Files. Oh, my god. What if it's all bogus? The files, the crimes, everything. Maybe they're just putting Anyone in there they don't like. (slap) There's a purpose, and there's a plan. And I'm not so stupid as to think there's no plan Just because I don't understand it! Here's a news flash. We're just the button men. If we were meant to be analysts, We'd be working upstairs. Would you forget the party line for once And make the call? OK. (keys rattling) You do it. You're the hero. Just remember... She was in the news, And they made her disappear. How much easier would it be to get to you? No one even knows you exist. Who knows where you'll wake up tomorrow? (ring) (ring) Hello. It's for you. Yeah? Sir. Yes, sir. Right away, sir. Yes, sir. I understand, sir. Yes, sir. (hangs up telephone) We got work to do. Someone's at the exit. Our exit? Uh, what do we do? The exit procedure. Whoa. Wait a minute. I've never done this before. Don't you usually do this with Owen? That's right, my friend. But Owen's not here, is he? And the rules clearly state That 2 senior technicians Have to be present at all exit procedures. Right, but I am not a senior technician. Hey, I need help here. That was a phone call from upstairs... Personal contact, direct orders from above. They never do that. We can't screw this up. Uh... We? Yes, we. (machine whirring) As far as I understand... Sir, Only senior techs are allowed To perform the exit procedure. Perhaps it would be in my best interest To abstain until receiving clearance from... Higher up. You little prick. OK. OK, I get it. Look, you help me with this, I'll tell them about your girlfriend. OK? When? What? When will you let them know? As soon as we're done with this. All right? OK. What do I do? Just follow my lead. OK, here we go. "Step one... visual confirmation of subject In exit room." (typing) Oh, no. Owen. It's Owen. Shut up. Ah! (gasps) Hello. Hello! Hello. (screaming) Hello. Anyone there? Hello. What now? Shh! Please! Aah! "Question one... Please state your name." Huh? Who are you? He doesn't recognize your voice. Owen: Who are you people? They fried his brain. Please state your name. They fried his brain like the rest. Shut... Up. Owen. I think it's Owen. Thank you. Please... "question 2... Do you believe in god?" What? What? Question 2... do you believe in god? What is this? Screw you! Please answer yes or no. What kind of god would do this to people? Please answer yes or no. No. OK? No! Now let me go. Let me go! Goddamn it! Let me out of here! Hit it. I need a doctor! What does it do? Just hit it. Please! For christ's sake! (screaming) Still want your girlfriend To sail through to the exit? He... He's gone. It's over. He was one of us. No. Once inside, he's one of them. So this is your big exit procedure? What are we doing here? "Do you believe in god?" It all hinges on that?! I just read the questions And push the buttons, OK? What happens if you push yes? I don't know. No one's ever said yes. Here. Send this upstairs. Do it. (owen screaming) Do you believe in god? (ring) What kind of animals would do this? (elevator dings) Owen is... Owen is probably out sick again. Yes. You sure? What the hell are you doing? You're not allowed in there. I'm through pushing buttons. No! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! (door closes) I'm inside. OK. (rumbling) (elevator rumbles) Oh. Thank god. You stupid jackass. Good evening, Mr. Dodd. I believe these belong to you. Well, it looks as though You've got yourself a little bit Of a situation down here. May we? The boys upstairs felt you could perhaps use a hand, And so here we are. My name is Jax, and these are My associates Mr. Finn and Mr. Quigley. Right. Gentlemen, first things first. We locate our mouse. He has no implant, And so we shall have to do this The old-fashioned way, I'm afraid. Mr. Quigley, run a visual check on all rooms. He couldn't have gone far. Yes, sir. Thank you. Mr. Finn, run a probability tree On his potential movements. Let's have some contingencies, shall we? Right away, sir. Excuse me, Mr. Jax, sir. Uh, excuse me, sir. Yes, Mr. Cod? Uh... It's dodd, sir. Oh. What... What do I do? I'm sorry? You? Yes. I almost forgot. I have your orders from upstairs. It's a personal delivery. Ha ha. Ha. "Order number 793..." blah blah blah blah. "Commence standard series of needle tests On rains group." You do know what that means? Yes, sir. Of course, sir. All in a day's work, sir. Right away, sir. Do us a teensy favor And use Mr. Wynn's auxiliary monitor. We'll need the big guns here For our little mouse hunt. Of course, sir. Anything I can do to help, sir. That's the spirit, Mr. Mod. Way to keep the world safe for democracy. Have we got a visual yet? Quigley: Still working on it, sir. OK. "K, g, k." that's 3 odds. "M, a, q." also 3 odds. Safe. Like taking candy from a baby. "A, z, z." "a, z, z." Rains: Got it. Oh. I don't know why we bother with these things anymore. "A, z, z." Hmm. That's the first time I've seen a "z." Do you think it means anything? I don't know. Ah, don't let the door... (door closes) Damn it! She's gone. (typing) OK. Subject is isolated. Now the tricky part. (whirring) Uh! OK. They were last seen here... Less than an hour ago. So she should still be in the same quadrant. The rooms move. I mean, they have to. She can't be that far. Yeah, but if we veer too far off course looking for her, We'll never find the edge. OK. Well, what do you suggest, killer? We cut our losses? Uh... Guys. Are we sure this room is safe? Maybe he just starved to death. God, I'm hungry. What are you doing? We could use these. (removing boots) We have to keep moving. We have to get back on track. We've already chased our tails For an hour looking for her. God, this headache is not going away. Maybe it's the chip in your head. What? Well, it's true, isn't it? I mean, they now put bio-receivers in all you army boys. Keeps you on a leash. (door opens) Lady, you've got a hell of an imagination. Jackpot. It's her. Hmm. Is she all right? Uh... She's not moving. Great. Hey. Hey, wake up. Are you all right? Rise and shine. Is she... There's a pulse. She's burning up. Can you hear me? Oh, my god. What happened to you? I don't... Feel so good. (coughs) I need a doctor. Don't let her touch you! Let go! Aah! Oh, my god! Don't leave me. You... You just... I...I didn't mean to. She scratched, and I just... Haskell: You put her out of her misery. My headache's gone. Something was eating away at her... A chemical or a virus. We never checked this room for traps. It could be in the air. Let's see your arm. We've got to get out of here. Show me your arm. He's right. We've got to get out of here. Your arm, where she scratched you. Let's see it. Why? You think... Yes, I think. Fine! There! See? Nothing! A flesh wound. Aah! Sure. Nothing. What do we do with him? What do you mean? I think whatever was eating away at her is spreading to him. Hey. Hello. I'm still here. Not for long. I say we ditch him. Screw you! OK, just relax, guys. Nobody's ditching anyone. Look at him. Oh, my god. What? It's your face. Crap. (gulp) Please don't leave me. This is horrible. You want to baby-sit a dead man, be my guest. Please. I'll do anything. Anything? From now on, You test the rooms... All of them. Fine. Oh. Well, we're not going down there. No sense wasting a good boot. Get off him! Aah! (thud) Help me. He's still alive down there. Forget it. He's gone. You heartless son of a bitch! (screaming) No! Don't come near me. I was protecting us. You murdered him. He was infected. You saw it. It was spreading. We'd be dead by now. You don't know that. Wynn: Uh, actually, he's right. It's a highly contagious form of necrotizing fasciitis... A flesh-eating disease. Who the hell are you? I... I've come to help you. Damn. Problem, Mr. Scrod? No problem, sir. Anything of interest? Well, actually, sir, I was about to... Would you care to share with the rest of the class? Yes, sir. As I was running my test series, As instructed, sir, The quarry intersected with my subjects, sir. Good work, rod. Who says they only hire The mentally challenged down here? Open. Thank you, sir. Up on the main monitor now, please. Wynn: We collect... I mean, they collect data and run tests, All kinds of tests... Testing chemical and biological agents, Measuring brain activity, endurance. Most of it I don't understand. And that's just what I see in my... Department. I hear about others who do different work. I've even heard there are other facilities... Cubes. Christ. Well, I just heard rumors. Why can't we remember anything? I don't know. I always assumed It was so that they could have Blank slate? A blank slate to work with, but... You bastards have been using us as lab rats. Hey, man, not me. I'm just a computer guy... System checks, stuff like that. Oh, yeah. You just followed orders. Yeah. You make me sick. Look, you got it all wrong. I hate my job. Your job? How can you do this to people? It was your choice. Look, you volunteered, Only you don't remember anymore. At least, that's what they told us. I... You believed them? Well, yeah. I saw the consent forms... Except for yours. You're lying. Who would volunteer for this? Well, it was either this or execution, so... What? They say you're all condemned prisoners Who volunteer for the experiments Instead of facing the death penalty. I never did anything to deserve this. Yeah. Well, tell that to meyerhold, right? Hey! We're innocent, damn it! I didn't volunteer for this! I know. See, your consent form was missing. Shut up. While you were doing your systems checks, Did you happen to see a little girl? No. Yes. I mean... I saw her. I saw one, a little girl... In your dreams. What? Yeah. It's hard to explain. Uh... Here. You see, another thing they have us do Is record the subjects'... Well, the people's dreams. Her name's Anna, right? Haskell: They can see into our dreams? Yeah. Where is my daughter, you piece of shit?! I don't know. You're lying! No. Please. I came to help. Rains. We need him. Why? I can show you the exits. OK. Go ahead. Where are they? You were wrong about the cube. It's only 25 rooms all around. Only 2 rooms have "z" coordinates, Value 26. They periodically move to the perimeter, But those 2 exit points are monitored. Now, there's supposed to be an auxiliary exit That leads directly outside the cube. How do we get to that one? I don't know. So what use is he? He can show us how to avoid the traps. Yes, definitely. OK. Just read me the coordinates From the surrounding rooms, please. I was right. They're coordinates. Jax: Well, well... It seems that our little mouse Is a rat after all. Mr. Finn, could you do something about that, please? Yes, sir. (computer beeping) This one's "c, f, p." (sizzling) What the hell? Damn. What is it? The letters... They just disappeared. What? They're all gone. They know I'm here. So now would be a good time to move. Good idea. You first. (door closes) OK. I can't make any promises, but this should be the way. Jax: Mr. Quigley, Could you isolate that quadrant for me, please? (computer beeping) Ah. Mr. Finn, show me The current trap configuratio, s'il vous plait. (computer beeping) Mmm... Merci. Now, let's make their life A little more interesting, shall we? Oh! OK. Trapped. It sure looked easier from my desk. Uh! They've trapped all the rooms around us. Now what? Really glad you showed up to help. My god. I'm actually starting to enjoy myself. You know what? I think we should all Keep getting together and doing this a lot more ofte. (telephone rings) (ring) Oh, god-damn it. What? Sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Sorry, sir. Right away, sir. (mockingly) "just finish it, you idiot." Ungrateful cretins. You didn't hear that. OK... Gentlemen, We have the word from on high. It's time to blow this Popsicle stand. Mr. Quigley. Sir? You heard the man. Just finish it. Yes, sir. OK, OK. Let me think. Let me think. (electrical buzzing) What the... Ah, Christ! OK, OK. Ah! Now what do we do? Ah... The floor. The floor! I'm sorry. Goddamn it! I don't want to die in here! What's happening? What stopped it? Wynn: Uh... I don't know. Jax: Come on, you piece of... What the hell? I don't know, sir. We suddenly lost contact. Yes. I can see that. Why? Maybe the energy required for the test itself Blew out the capacitor. I mean, we're not talking state-of-the-art equip... (whistles) Wrong. That's not how it works. That's not how it was designed. Someone is screwing with the connection. I don't know, sir. It isn't me. Me neither, sir. What? I have no idea. It's not me. I swear. Now, you wouldn't lie to me, Now, would you, Mr. Clod? No, sir. Wouldn't think of it. Questions? Comments? What are we waiting for? Get us back on line. Damn. Nothing. "Nothing" is not an answer. Uh, excuse me, sir. Excuse me. What is it? Uh... Can I use the facilities, sir? Just go! For the love of... Where do they find these people? Quigley: I don't think it's the software, sir. Finn: It's definitely a hardware problem. Yoohoo. Listen. This is getting embarrassing now, OK? I needn't remind you gentlemen That in a few minutes, we'll have no choice But to send people in there, and it'll... Call me impulsive, but I could probably think of a couple of names. (coughing) quigley. Finn. You know, right off the top... (alarm sounding) What is that noise? Something's wrong with the main power source. It's gone into reset mode. What the hell is going on? Boot. Oh! Oh, damn. You can say that again. What? The power go out? Yep. So the traps don't work. That's the good news, yeah. What's the bad news? It's gone into reset mode. The system will restart itself in 10 minutes. The first routine that runs on restart Is a clean sweep. That as bad as it sounds? The clean sweep program flash-incinerates Anything still living in all the rooms. So, we've got to move. Well, which way do we go? Uh... I don't know. OK, OK. Last time I ran the numbers, You were pretty much in the center of the structure. So I guess we just keep going in the same direction Until we get to the edge, right? Great. So we're back to square one. Do you have a better idea? No, I don't, because I'm not the one Who uses people as fucking guinea pigs in this place! Whoa! Wait. Back to square one. Dodd. Dodd is the only one Who could power it down this quickly. But he knows that the reset mode would kick in. So why would he... Of course. The clean sweep happens After they realign to zero position. What? Quick, let me see your map. When the power comes on, the rooms are programmed To realign back to their original positions Before the clean sweep starts. Now, if we're in one of the exit rooms, Like "a, z, z" here, It'll move us to the perimeter, And we'll have about... 3 seconds to get out. Before it fries us. Yeah. If that room hasn't moved, we might just make it. Come on. You know, Mr. Wodd has been in the little boys room An awfully long time. Gotcha. Uh! A noble attempt to save Your protege, Mr. Dodd, but... Quite foolish ultimately. Have I have that widget back, please? I don't think I can do that, sir. Mr. Dodd, are you disobeying a direct order? Yes. There. (gulp) (pen rattling) Cute... And rather cliche, In an endearing kind of way. Unfortunately, I do believe There is a penalty, a rather strict penalty For sabotaging state property. Ooh. Instant paralysis. They weren't kidding, were they? However, not to worry, Mr. Dodd. You still will be able to feel. (dodd screams) All right. It's 5 minutes till reset. I think I found the source of our power problem. Does anyone know where this goes? Anyone? That's the central coupling. I got it, sir. Still doesn't solve our observation problem. They could be escaping as we speak. Sir, in less than 5 minutes from now, The clean sweep kicks in, And then I think our problem will evaporate. Mr. Finn, I don't trust machines. I have a machine to thank for this... (tapping) And this. I need to see them With my own god-given eye. Of course, sir. I just... I don't know how. Shh. Sometimes I even amaze myself. Mr. Finn, one of our runaway rats Is a former squad soldier, is he not? Yes, sir. That would be haskell, the big fellow. Yeah, the big fellow. And they still bio-chip The enlisted men, do they not? Of course. Sir, that's brilliant. Ah. Mr. Quigley comes through. Mr. Finn, acquire us an up link To the squad surveillance network, Por favor. Yes, sir. Right away, sir. Time. Just over 4 minutes. Aah! Hold on! Aah! (thud) There's no way he survived that. We got to go. Come on. And we're locked on. Sir, we have a visual. It's a weak signal. Ah. Your tax dollars hard at work. Well, transmit the kill code. Pain inhibitors activated. Neuro-chem enhancers amplified. Rains: Are we there yet? Wynn: Almost. Haskell? Move it! Get off her! (coughing) Thanks. Yeah. OK. Come on. How much farther? We're almost there. "A, z, z." this is it! Uh! It's OK. The power's out. The power's out. Chickliss. (gulp) Oh, man. (rumbling) Just over one minute! Can't this thing go any faster? Oh! Sir, we've got the grid display back. They're at the perimeter. 30 seconds till clean sweep. Well, I think it's time for our little surprise. I hope your shortcut worked, Mr. Quigley. (water trickling) (gasps) Oh! Water? The auxiliary exit. Leads directly outside. Now what? Can you swim? Huh? Wynn: Jump... Down! (choking) No! Jump! Jax: Well, did we get them? Sorry, sir. Signal got scrambled at flashpoint. I think we got them. I don't like it. Get a squad to the exit point. (helicopters approaching) Hey, this way. (darts firing) Come on. No. Run. Run! Go! (wynn groans) He's conscious. Thank god. Well, welcome back, Mr. Wynn. You're conscious, so, yes, we can begin now. "Eric Wynn... "as you have been found guilty "of high treason, sabotage, and various other crimes Against your country and your god..." And so on and so forth, blah, blah, blah... "your sentence has been extended for 2 more lifetimes." What sentence? I don't even remember the trial. Oh. Well, you were found guilty. No further questions. Wait! What are you doing? Well, we've decided on a few modifications Before putting you back inside. Wait! Mr. Wynn, you are holding up progress. Don't I get a choice? Don't all the condemned get a choice? Well... I choose death. No, Mr. Wynn... You do not get a choice. You have already made your choice. I believe this is your signature. I...I don't understand. (mockingly) "I don't understand." You chose to become a test subject many years ago. Now you simply don't remember that. Oh, it's all standard procedure. But my job, dodd, Owen, chickliss. All lab rats, just like you... Observing the observers, you know, that kind of thing. "Oh, very, very interesting results." Wait! You're actually starting to bore me now. Where is she? Oh, the elusive ms. Rains. Uh... Well, you needn't worry about her. You didn't catch her. (laughing) He's all yours. Don't touch me. Don't worry. This won't hurt. Wait! Aah! Anna: Mommy, I'm cold. Why can't we have a fire? Rains: Shh. Because the bad people might find us. Hey, I have something to show you. See? That's us. We're superheroes. These are very special Because they were drawn by a very special person. Is he a superhero, too? Yes. Yes, he is. Man: What's wrong with him? He doesn't seem to know we're here. This room is green. (sniffing) Hi there. This room is green. Yes, it is. Woman: What is it? Shock? I want to go back to the blue room. I think he's mentally handicapped. That's all we need... a retard. Don't. How the hell did he survive in here? I want to go back. I want to go back. Back. Back. I want to go back. I want to go... Back.
