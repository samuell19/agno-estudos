Allow me to introduce myself. Get off the stage! That's me, Jordan Sanders. Well, actually, this is me now. I know. I get it. Big change, right? But that was me in 1993, the day I decided to show everyone at Windsor Middle School what I did best. The laws of science. They're actually true. I can trust them. I can rely on them. Who cares? There she is. You know her: the person who just can't let you live your best life. Prepare to behold a death-defying feat! I trust the conservation of mechanical energy 100%. So much, in fact, that I am willing to risk my very life to demonstrate. Boo! Um... Because this ball should not be able to pass this very spot again. Go. ♪ Hello? I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was... ♪ Now, this should have been my moment of victory. And for seven glorious seconds, I was on top of the world. But then, just like that, it was over. Ow. Ow, ow, ow. Something changed. Little did I know, that something would be me. Jordan, I know you had big plans to go out there and show those kids how awesome you really are so they wouldn't be so hard on you at school every day. Being me sucks. I want to be someone else. I know it's hard right now, but that's just because you're little. When you grow up, it won't be like this. - It won't? - Nope. - Because you're smart. - Yes. I am smart, aren't I? And do you know what happens to smart people when they're big? They become the boss. - Really? - Really. And nobody... and I mean nobody... bullies the boss. Well, then I can't wait to be big. So I can be the boss and no one will bully me. Now that's my girl. Because I'll bully them first. ♪ Hey, hey ♪ - ♪ Ladies ♪ - ♪ Hey ♪ ♪ Where my girls with the blonde hair? ♪ ♪ Where my girls, where my girls with the jet black? ♪ - ♪ Jet black ♪ - ♪ Hey ♪ ♪ Where my girls with the purple hair? ♪ ♪ Whip it, whip it everywhere, wh-wh-whip it everywhere ♪ ♪ If you don't need no validation ♪ ♪ Wave them hands in the air, no hesitation... ♪ Jordan, it's time to wake up and live your dreams.

What are you still doing here? I overslept. Forgive me. You always have an excuse. Why you always got your guard up, huh? Have I ever hurt you? No, you haven't, because my guard is always up. - Why do we have this discussion back and forth? - Wh... I should've known what you was about. You got my name as "D Boy" in your contacts. Yes, I saw that. "D" is... it's-it's DeAndre, which is French for Trevor. - What? - You know what? I don't have to explain myself. - Jordan, come on. - Why were you going through - my contacts in the first place? - Come on, Jordan. - DeAndre? - You have to go. - No, no, no. - Oh, my... - Are you serious right now? - I'm not go...

Wow, that looks so good on you. - Huh? - Huh? - I-I thought you said something. - No, uh... So, wait... so are... Wait, are you gonna do... gonna pitch your idea to Jordan today? - Yeah. Today is the day. - Yeah? Yeah! But tomorrow's also good, too, I heard. No, no, wait, you... April, you've been saying "tomorrow" for, like, months now. DiscoverEyes is great. Yeah, you got to go for it. Hey. You got this. Okay. - You got this. - Yeah. - Oh, wait, that's a step. - I got it. I'm good. And you can get this. - I'm sorry, you say something? - Huh? No, no, no. Jordan, Jordan, yeah, you can... you can get the product, the apps... Mm! Not gonna catch me slippin'. Mr. Connor. May I help you? I am waiting on Jordan. Oh, well, um... would you like to wait in our lovely lobby? Nope. She's fine with me chilling in here. - Um... - Cool, cool. Oh. Uh, of course. She is gonna love that you're sitting at her desk with your feet up. I'm just gonna go get her. She's here! Take cover, everyone! I've gotta be at my desk! - Hurry, hurry! - I'm sorry. - Yes, you are. - Good morning. Okay. - So, Connor... - Shh! How did you do that? Thank you. Why are y'all out here congregating like you were in a yard? Sorry, ma'am. Sorry. That's not what I'm paying you for. Can I interest you in some magic? There is no such thing as magic. Well, what about Black Girl Magic? You're a black girl fire hazard. Now, go and disappear. What? Happy birthday! Call the city and get JS Innovations off - that dumpy doughnut truck's delivery route. - Grab the cake! Of course. Immediate... Who did this? I told you guys no carbs around me! Oh, uh... Um... Your biggest client is in your office. Connor? How did he get up there, April? You know you're not supposed to speak directly to him. I didn't. I... He was already there when I got there, and I-I tried to tell him it's... Shh. There she is. Connor the Incredible. What a pleasant surprise. Please, stay seated with your feet on my desk. It's... actually fine. They got to be on the desk. Up top! Well, what can I do for you? I am bouncing to another firm. What? No. No. Connor, you can't jump. You're my biggest client. That's why I wanted to give you the heads-up in person. Wait a minute. Where is this coming from? We just want a fresh voice to bring in new tech ideas. Listen, my next product, it-it's still in beta testing, but I promise you, HomeGirl, it's gonna be big. It's-it's more than a virtual assistant. It is a virtual assistant if she were your homegirl. It's just not for us. All right. Story time, JoJo. Oh, not again. When I was a kid, I lived a hard-knock life. - Mm-hmm. - Anyway, I started getting into tech, and one day, I had to come to my dad and ask for a $10 million loan to start my company. And he's like, "What? "When you start a company, you don't get ten million. I'll give you five million." - And that hurt. - Wow. 'Cause I was expecting ten. I had budgeted for ten million. Mm. So I go to Grandmother and Grandfather. And I'm like, "Can you invest more millions of dollars in my company?" My grandfather's like, "Well, I don't know what this is." - No. - That was hard, but he gave it to me. And then, finally, I sell the company for $400 million. So, that's my struggle. That's how I came up. I felt that. I do. I mean, you could give me a chance like Grandmother and Grandfather gave you, and just... just... take that leap of faith and-and-and-and-and-and-and... and-and-and-and-and-and-and... - and... and... - Look, JoJo, okay. I'm meeting with another firm to talk about new gaming app ideas on Friday. - I'm sowwy. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Connor, please just give me a chance before you make any rash moves. All right, fine. 48 hours. Cool? Yes. I will take it. Thank you. And I promise fresh voices coming at you. Also, you... do you know you have, like, three dinner napkins on your back? I didn't know if that was a choice or if you leaned on something or... No, it's fashion. It's fashion. It's... - Oh. You got one shot, JoJo. - It's fashion. Don't blow it. All right, people. Settle down. Oh. Apparently, it's lunch, since Scott wants to eat during our meeting. Okay. There you go. Take a bite. We don't have all day, Scott. Eat. Yummy. Anybody else hungry? No. I just had salad. - Mm, I'm fasting. - All right. Connor wants a new gaming app, the best thing we've ever come up with, and we're gonna give it to him. It needs to be big. - It needs to make noise. - But when you say "make noise," do you mean, like, literally make noise, like the app makes noise, or is it just a... Okay. I-I get it. I know that face. We've got 48 hours to save our asses. So let's go. - Go. - Impress me, people. Um, an-an app like, uh, Tinder, uh, but instead of matching people for dates, you match with people for dating advice, uh, and then analyze why all your dates went bad. So, like Tinder but sad. Like how your parents felt the day you were born. - Oh. Okay. - Next. Um, a crossword puzzle app for news junkies. So, like a crossword puzzle that makes you angry. - No... - Exactly how I'm feeling right now when you come up... - Ow! - ...with those ding-dong, ding-dong, bad ideas! I think I have a pretty interesting idea. What? You do, April? I don't even sound like that. What's going on? - Nothing. - What? I didn't say anything. Somebody said something. Uh, y'all... y'all need to be quiet. - We having a meeting up here about important stuff. - Shh. Sorry about that. So, you have nothing? You have nothing? Wow. Nothing. She didn't say anything. He thought he heard something. Y'all ain't said nothing. Connor is out the door unless we crack this. And in case I wasn't clear, if Connor is out the door, all of you are out. Bye-bye, health care. Which you know you need. Bye-bye, Ping-Pong table. Bye-bye, ergonomic chair, - which... - Sorry. Dang. You better stop quivering that lip. - You better not cry. - Stop, girl. - Stop crying. - This isn't about you, Melissa. Are there no more ideas? Fine. Once again, I will have to figure it out myself. Go. Go! I can't look at you anymore. I have an idea for a new app? Are you asking me or telling me? I'm telling you. I'm telling you that I have an idea for a new app. It's called DiscoverEyes, and I... No. I don't take pitches from assistants. It's just... I've been here for three years, and you promised room for growth and... So I owe you a promotion? No, no, no. That's not what I'm saying. I... I know this is a terrible time, but I-I really think I could help this company if you just gave me a chance like... someone gave you a chance. Let me explain something to you, Miss April. Nobody gave me anything. I saw an opportunity, I took it, and I ran with it. And you know what? I'm still running. Every single day. You know how many times I had to pitch my first idea before I sold it? Seventeen. And I sure as hell didn't take no for an answer. - Wait, so does that mean you'll hear my pitch? - No. You know what it is? I'm a taker. You're not. So just concentrate on being my assistant and try being good at that first. You can't talk to April that way. Who let the fire hazard in here? She's just making deliveries. Come on, Stevie, let's go. Were you always this way? - Was I always what way? - Mean. No. Actually, I used to be just like you when I was little. And you know what? People treated me like crap. Then what happened? I got big, and I got rich. So, now who gonna check me, boo? Well... well... "Well... well..." Well, you ain't ready to play with the grown-ups, so go ahead with your little self. I wish you were my age. Then I'd check you. Everybody who you're awful to would check you, too, boo. Well, I wish your little cartoon dog would bite you. I wish you were little. What was that? What was what? What was...? Get out. Get out. Get that little chocolate Hogwart out! Are you okay? 'Cause you don't look so good. No, you don't look good. No, you don't look good. That's what happens when people don't eat carbs. They start seeing Satan. Move! - Go back to work! - Yep. Work! Work! Morning inspiration. It is better to have money and be brokenhearted than be broke and brokenhearted. Let's wake up and get this money. Come on. I need coffee. I told you watch it. I swear to God, when I see you again, I will whup your butt! I'm not the one. - What was that about? - Beats me. The usual. What's your usual? You playing with me, right? Here. Does that help you remember? Triple espresso with foam! You know, too much caffeine stunts your growth. First of all, shut up. And second of all, does all this body look like my growth has been stunted? Depends. How old are you? Thirty-eight. Well, then yes. Yes, it does. What the...? Oh, my God. I need to go to the hospital. Security! Homeless kid is trying to carjack! Who's missing a bag? No! Back off! No one is touching this bag! Step away from the car. It's me, Jordan. This is my car. I'm not losing my job over this! Ha! Hey, little girl. Who are your parents? Um, Jordan Sanders is my mom. Uh-uh. Jordan doesn't have a child. Well, she keeps me hidden. Just, please don't tell anyone you saw me. You poor child. That woman is even more horrible than I thought. She is not horrible. She just has a very demanding lifestyle that might be giving her a nervous breakdown. Hello? Hello, Child Services? Stop. Stop talking like that. How do you know what I'm gonna s... ...say? Where are my natural teardrop boobs? I paid 15 Gs for those things. Why?! Why did you change?! This can't be happening. Okay. No. Not this girl. Jordan, it's me. I got all 15 of your messages. Oh, aren't you cute. Are you related to Jordan? So you see her, too? See who? The little girl. Where's Jordan? Jordan? Do you really want to know? Yeah. She's inside me. So you ate her? Is that what happened? Did you cook her in your little Easy-Bake Oven? Jordan, hey, I'm here. Where are you? I got your dry cleaning. Did not pay me to babysit. I'm just gonna call her. She would never give her phone to a child. Got that right. I don't know what you did or how you did it, but you did something to Jordan, you crazy little Chucky doll. I'm calling the cops. Um, you had a strawberry doughnut stain on your shirt yesterday. What the hell? One night, we were brainstorming a dating app, and you were telling me the lamest story about how you lost your virginity in the back of your mom's Dodge Ram van. But you told your college sweetheart that he was your first. You lying thot. What in the black Jesus? This doesn't make any sense. You went to bed grown, and then you woke up... Little. But that's for white people. 'Cause black people don't have the time. - I know! - What happened? I can't even think of what could possibly have happened. No, no, no, no, no, no. I mean... how did you go from this to this? That's... I have never seen a better glow-up. April, can you help me and figure this out? No, you're right. I'm... sorry. Let me just focus. Think. - I got it. - What? Gucci Mane. He's had a better glow-up than you. I mean, he's happy, he's healthy, got a six-pack. He has a really nice smile, and I don't know if those are veneers, - but people say we smile alike... - April! Can you help me? Mm-mm. I don't like that. - What? - I like kids to have old-school manners, so... I'm not a child. - Mm... - Okay. Please help me. "Please help me... Miss April, ma'am." Are you kidding me? No. Please help me... Miss April, ma'am. Okay, child. Okay, um, well, try Benjamin Button syndrome. No. That's when you're born old, and then you age backwards until you're a baby again. Oh, well, my bad. I must have gotten my magical body curses mixed up! Wait a minute. - What? - That's it. That girl. The fire hazard from the doughnut truck. She was waving that dumb wand and wished I was little! Yeah, wishes don't come true. 'Cause if they did, I'd be on maternity leave with Michael B. Jordan's baby by now. Okay. So you're gonna go to the office, stop by the truck, kidnap her and bring her back to me, okay? I have some duct tape. We'll just starve her until she reverses this. Yeah. Okay, or we could just ask her to use her toy wand to make another wish, 'cause that's way less felony-ish. Just... - What are you doing? - What? I need a glass of rosé. It's too early for tequila shots. You're too young to drink. Relax. Just a couple of sips to take the edge off. "Female... Gary Coleman disease." He died? Nosy neighbor. Swear to God, you're gonna learn today. What?! Child Protective Services. Are your parents or legal guardians home? Oh, um... April! Sorry. What you got there? Nice rosé? So, who's in charge? Me. I have that, uh, Jordan Sanders is listed as the owner of this apartment. Correct. Paid in full. Okurrr? You told me your name is Jordan Sanders. I did. Well, the, um... the other Jordan, the owner, he's, uh, my brother. Yeah. My-my dad. I'm a junior. Yeah, 'cause women can be juniors, too. And where is your father now? Mm. My, um, father. That is a good question. - Auntie? - Mm-hmm. Where's Daddy? You know exactly where he is. - Um... - He's, um... - overseas. - Space. - Uh, in a space overseas. - Mm-hmm. Space Force. Got it. And your mother is where? She's a crackhead. Yeah, Jordan is a crack baby. It's so sad. That's why she's so hyper all the time. Oh, yeah. Yeah, okay, let me just document this. Aunt and crack baby. No, no, no, but this-this is, this is just temporary, because she's going back to her dad soon. Mm-hmm. Very soon. - Back where? - Home. In Hawaii with my brother. That's President Barack Obama. Hmm. No, that's... my brother. Like, do they just think we all look alike? Same dog and everything. Okay, uh, and could you please tell me why you aren't in school today? - Hmm? - School? Girl, bye. I haven't been to school in, like, years. No, that's not what she meant. That's not what you meant, right? Oh, yeah, that's not what I meant. - Mm. - Joking. Okay, good, because any parent or guardian of a child during the ages of mandatory attendance shall send such child to public school, private school or a homeschooling program. Furthermore, any parent or guardian who violates this code section shall be subject to fine, imprisonment, community service or any combination of such penalties as the court sees fit. Say what, now? "Say what, now" is enroll this child in school, or somebody is going to jail. That's what now say what. By "somebody," do you mean... You. That would be you. Now, the school district which Jordan would be assigned to would be... ah... - Windsor Middle School. - Windsor? - Mm-hmm. - Oh, hell no. Yes. Hell yes! We love that school. Enroll her there today, and I will be checking that you do so. No. Look here, lady. I am a businesswoman, and I have a company to run. She sells Girl Scout Cookies. She just takes it really seriously. - I'm like... - So I don't have time for Child Services, and I sure don't have time for school, okay? Let me be clear. I will have you in foster care and your goofy aunt over here in jail if you don't. Okurrr? Yes. Okay. Yes. - No problem. - Excellent. Now, if you don't mind, I'm just gonna get - a video of you two together. - Are you gonna... post this? And this apartment because... I like the evidence. I can't go to school. I'm not going to jail. I can't believe I have to say this. You're gonna have to be me in the office. They're not gonna listen to me. I'm like the homey. You have to make them listen. I'll be on the phone in your ear, so don't say anything I don't tell you to say, don't do anything I don't tell you to do. So you're still in charge? Always. Just keep everyone focused on fresh ideas, or else the whole company is over. That just really makes me uncomfortable. Oh. But do you know what else is uncomfortable? Unemployment. Okay. I will agree to cover for you at the office if you agree to promote me to creative exec. What'd you just say? I said, um, for you to promote me to creative exec. Well... look whose balls just dropped. I got to take what I want. - Isn't that what you said? - Maybe. So, deal? Deal. Yes! - Just... - You know, since I have to be you, I should probably dress the part and borrow some of your clothes. Your body can't fit into my clothes. This is squats. This is Pilates. That body looks like BabyGap, Gymboree, OshKosh B'gosh to me. Ooh, you get on my nerves. Fine. Yes! This is ridiculous. Let me get this straight... you went to Target, and you got me this? "Tarjay." The overalls is what I got. The shirt is mine. I look great. Looking like Cookie from "Empire." April. - Uh, you know this kid? - Oh, hey, Vince. You know how Jordan always asks me to do everything? - Yeah. - Uh, well, this is her niece. Yeah, I'm watching her while she's out of town. Oh. That-that explains it. Yeah, we had a little confusion with her yester... Um... Uh, did-did you guys, uh, call Lyft? No. I got my keys. No, actually, Jordan left these for me. Yeah. It was part of our agreement. I-I don't think Auntie said that. Now, stay out of grown folks' business. Let me just take... Give me the keys I let you play with. She's so funny. Ah, here we go. Okay, how do I close the doors? Now, how do I start the car? Just put it in electric mode. It's easier to... Whoa! Stop! April! Okay, I got it. I got it. W-Watch it! Stop! What-what are you doing?! Whoa! Okay, I got it. I got it. - No, you don't. - Oh. No, I don't. Oh, I got... okay, I got it now. I can't go in there. Mm-mm. You heard Agent Bea. If you're not registered today, I'm going to county. But this place, the memories. It was so hard for me. I never felt so small. I-I know this is hard for you, and I'm sorry, but I'm not going to jail for you. You got to... you're going to school. If you think I'm listening to someone with such poor control over their edges as you, then, girl, you are severely mistaken. Okay. That's it. Listen, I'm the adult, and you're the child, so when I say something, you listen. Please. If you don't stop embarrassing me in front of these white people... Well, you're embarrassing yourself. You know what? I'm sick of you. Say one more thing. - I dare you. - Fine. You're too fat for that skirt. You know what? If you want to take it there, we going old-school. - What? - Oh. - Let's go. - I'm requesting backup. We have a BMW situation. Black mama whupping. - How you like that? - Mm-mm! - Try me. - Okay, see? - How you like that? - No. You tried it. No, you tried it. 'Cause I've been looking at you like a little girl, but you a grown-ass woman, and you gonna catch a grown beat. Fine. 'Cause I got this good knee back. And how about this? - April. - Should I sell it? - Give that back to me now. - What you gonna do if I don't? I told you not to test me! Yes! Start spanking your kids! Remind me of my mama. Can't believe I'm back in this hellhole. That must be Principal Han. Just shut up and stay cool, and I got it. - Hey. Nice to meet you. - Hey. Nice to meet you. Welcome, Jordan. Uh... She's just nervous. - Aw. - Oh. Okay. Well, let's get you started. Come on. Pull it together.

Okay, we should, um... we should go. - Okay. Yeah. - Okay. Bye, Gary. We can get it. ♪ Run, run, run, mama say come home ♪ - ♪ Before the streetlights do... ♪ - Okay. We have a new student joining our class. Ladies and gentlemen, this is Jordan. All right? And here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna give her a nice, warm... a Windsor welcome. Huh? Let's start with... There you go. What are you doing? This is not a Windsor welcome. This is not wh-what... what I-I taught you guys. - Hey, hey, hey. - I blame the parents. You know what, Mr. Marshall, I'll just take it from here. Hi, everyone. I'm Jordan Sanders. And I want to make a few things clear before we get started. First of all, you're meeting the new alpha of the class. I can establish my dominance easily, or you can make it hard for yourself. Oh, nice pants. If the floods are a-comin'. Come on. Yeah, your clothes suck. Charlie, zip it. Thank you, Gary. It's Mr. Marshall... for you. I'm the teacher. Mm-hmm. And I'm the student. Okay, where was I? Yeah. We're gonna skip the "haze the new girl" thing. No. It's dull. Predictable. And I will strike back with a vengeance like you've never known. Well, if you didn't want to be hazed, you should have combed your hair. Okay, you know what? One more outburst, and I'll cancel Spirit Day. I'm not joking around, young lady. But you can't cancel Spirit Day, Mr. Marshall. I am Spirit Day. - Oh, good Lord. - Which reminds me... get your tickets to the hypest school spirit pep rally ever. This year's theme is Winchella. Windsor's most talented students... and others that we couldn't block from signing up because of new rules of inclusion... ...will show what makes Windsor the best. Yeah! All right, all right, all right. Thank you. Pipe down. Pipe down. Open up your books. You know what I mean? We're gonna do some learning. Start pretending to read. Oh, boy, you know, meeting new people. It won't always be like this, okay? 'Cause I could tell when I met you that you are a special young lady. You know what? - I feel like you get me. - Really? I feel like I get you, too. So, you feeling what I'm feeling? You want to quit? I think about quitting every day. But I can't, because I have a responsibility. Wh-What are you feeling? Oh. No, I'm not feeling that at all. I'm a... I'm an adult... adult man. And you should have a seat. Okay, Mr. Hard to Get. I see you. Mm-hmm. Go ahead and sit down. It's time. Time to sit down. Just don't... you know, just look... look-look the other way. Look the way... look the... look up there. Look away from me. - Teach me something. - Don't... So, uh, what are us kids into these days? I'm looking for the next big thing, you know. Uh, excuse you. Cutting without tipping is rude. Ugh. Really? You feed this to children? - To eat? - Mm-hmm. Postmates. You got this, Jordan. You're grown. You're successful. These kids can't hurt you. Next table. Oh, my... She's coming over. Oh, really? - It's like that, sister? - Mm-hmm. Okay. Fine. Come on. Come here. Hey. Come here. Oh. Never thought I'd say thank you to anybody offering me the worst table in the house, but, um, thank you. - Sure. - Mm-hmm. Why do you guys need a "safe space" for lunch? Stop. - It's becoming clear. - Three years ago, I answered too many questions correctly. Friend Zone. I didn't have any new clothes at the start of school one year. Over. I don't even know why I'm he-he-h-here. Who did this to me? You better show yourself! D-Don't-don't worry. No one gets s-s-stuck in the Friend Zone forever. You're cute for thinking that. Keep living. No. He's right. Once everyone sees our talent at the pep rally, we can finally get out of the Friend Zone and be in the center of it all. We'll be cool with everyone. It's gonna be very "wh-what's up, what's up?" in the hall. Who does that Jasmine girl think she is? J-J-Ja-Ja-Jasmine, sh-she's... Sing it, Isaac. ♪ She's so ♪ ♪ Perfect. ♪ He doesn't stutter when he sings. I see. - These answers better be right. - Duh. What is wrong with this school? What is it? Guys, check this out! "When you can't afford a blowout or new sneakers"? Look at it. Order for Sanders. That's me. All right. Thank you. Da-da-da-da-da-da-da. There's no Postmates in school, okay? Sorry. You know what? I am done chasing you. A man who finds a wife finds a good thing. That's Bible, Gary. What a weird little girl. April, you have to come pick me up. These kids are demons. Jordan, I have my first meeting, and I am freaking out. I-I don't think I can do this. Calm down. Put me in your ear, like, on Bluetooth. - Hey, April. - Hey. I heard... Okay. Uh... - I heard Jordan was sick. - Yeah, she's... definitely gonna be out for, like, a day or two. You ready to hold it down without her? Mm-hmm. All right, well, I'll see you in the meeting. And I'm sure you're gonna shine. You shining already. Okay. Okay. Command their attention. - VR goggles... - Good idea. Oh, I think... I think we should do the... Right? Guys, I need to command your attention, please. Uh, can we all just quiet down and focus, please. Thanks. Where's Jordan? Um, she's under the weather. So I'm here just filling in for her. Is that why you're wearing her clothes? These aren't her... This? The-These aren't her clothes. These are my clothes. You don't wear cheetah. I always wear cheetah. Jordan is never sick. She must really be on her deathbed. Oh, which would be a developer's, uh, dream. Yeah. Was that Preston? Oh, if he wasn't so talented, I'd fire his butt. And he also has a good butt. He does. April's right. We need to focus. Thank you, Preston. No. No. Uh-uh. JSI is going under. I'm gonna need Melissa to shut up. - I need to get a new job. - No, you don't. I'm looking at Jordan's Facebook right now. - Don't check it. - This is off the rails. You have to show them you can be crazy. - Y'all, I can be crazy, so... chill. - Shoot. Okay. Do it now, or you'll never get control. - Do what? - Do it now! I said listen up! You want to see crazy?! I can show you crazy! Uh... What, y'all put bricks in here or something? Y'all recycle a lot. Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait. JSI is doing fine. We all have jobs. Let's do... Let's innovate! We're JS Innovations. I'm in charge. Oh, God, this is so hard. I don't know what that was, and... What are you wearing? You look like a cheerleader for the Migos right now. This is the worst day ever. I'm gonna need a stiff drink and some clothes that fit. Corner table for two. Right this way. Can I start you with something to drink? Oh, yes. I'll have a glass of rosé, please. Scotch on the rocks. Two rocks. And I mean two. If there's three, it's going back. How cute are you? - Are you in charge? - Mm-hmm. Let's get real. This black card's in charge. - What is this? - The kids' menu. Would you like this kid's foot up your... Oh, she'll have a Shirley Temple. Porterhouse, rare. Right away. Thank you. Any leads on the doughnut truck? The city doesn't provide contact info for the trucks, and since someone took them off our route... - Damn it. - But... these trucks need to be inspected every year, and they can't just go to any auto repair shop. So I narrowed it down to a dozen repair shops in the city that handle food truck inspections. And I have an intern making calls, so we should have a lead soon. - Thank you. - Here you go. Yes. Thank you. Mm. This is heaven. - I would... You know. - Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-mm-mm! Oh, it's not all bad at your school, though, 'cause can we talk about Mr. Marshall, the other white meat? Oh, girl, I was thinking about going back to pork. Hello. Oink, oink. Him fine as swine. I'd like to teach him some things. What are you gonna teach him in that scrawny, flat body? Well, at least I'm not dried up like a creek hit by a drought down there. Please stop. Just a dusty bed of rocks where water once flowed. First, that's not... it's not dusty. Anyways, what's up with you and Preston? Making puppy dog eyes at him all day. We're just friends. Well, yeah, 'cause you're too scared to get at him. You see, that's your problem with work and men. You can't close the deal. Wh-What about you? You hire employees but don't trust them. You meet people but don't make friends. You date, and you don't commit. Committing is overrated. I'm a boss. I can't be heartbroken. Men want me to be just like a Mary J. Blige song. Just down without them. But I'm too strong for that mess. Okay. Wait. Oh, can you actually just leave the whole bottle? 'Cause she left her card, right? She comes from money. What are you doing? Mm, nothing. Why are you sniffing and holding my glass? My hand is not on your glass. I literally see your baby fingers right now gripping my glass. Well, I think you're seeing things. Jordan, no drinking. I mean it. You got my aunties over there trippin'. Stop. Relax. I'm fine. She's fine. It's a game we play. I'm drinking. You're drinking. One, two, three, drink.

April. Y-You can't leave. If Vince sees you outside leaving, then he might call Agent Bea. Are you asking me to spend the night? I don't know how much longer I can take being 13. Please... Miss April, ma'am. Thank you. Well, see you at the crossroads, Wicked Witch. So, how's it look? Um... it'll get you through the night, yeah. You like this movie? Yeah, I love it. Work! Work! Work! Work! Work! Yes. Come through. And all lunch hours are canceled! - Are you serious? - Now suffer! Really? Evillene was a boss. I learned so much about running a company from her. We haven't had a lunch hour in six months! That explains a lot. But I wasn't always this hard on people. When I was first this age, I stopped being open and kind. Every time I tried to fit in, kids would just beat me down. Make fun of me, bully me. At that point, I just gave up on people. It hurt too much to care. Anyways, when I grew up, I guess I just attacked people first before they could attack me. I get it. You know, it's hard out here for girls. It's like, you get one shot if you're lucky, and if you don't hit the bull's-eye, people will drag you. Am I done? You finished and done. Cool. Initiating "Bed" light sequence.

What-what are you doing here? Well, what are you doing here? This is my house. Who are you?! Oh, um... Well, I'm April, with an "A" for "available." It's so good... so nice to meet you. Yes. Ooh. Wh-What I'm trying to understand is... why would you be in Jordan's apartment watching some... Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I know exactly who you are. You do? Well, sure. Man, listen, listen, everything's gonna be okay, all right? Don't worry, everything's gonna be fine. We're gonna figure this out together. It's-it's gonna take some adjusting, and... To be honest, I'd always imagined having my own kids at first, but... I guess, when God sends you a child to love, it doesn't matter where it comes from. Wait, what the hell are you talking about? This is why Jordan was so closed off to me. She was embarrassed to tell me she's a single mom. Oh, God, no. - No, no, no, no, no. Get out. - You know what? - I think you better go. You should go. - Go! Look at you. You're so cute, like a little doll. We can go together, but... you got to go. Just lovable. Look at... No, no, wait, wait, wait, wait. Oh, my God, you're so strong. Key. You sound just like your mama. That... that tough exterior just trying to... just trying to protect what's on the inside. Look, you ain't got to do that no more. - Just give me the key. - Okay? I'm here for you. All right? And look, don't-don't... Listen, don't... don't tell your mom, all right? Just-just give me a chance to explain, okay? I'll-I'll be back, all right? I'll be back. Daddy's home. Mama's home, too. I'm on Hinge, Tinder and Christian Mingle. So, now what? I hate to say it, but I have to go back to work. And you have to go back to... No, no, no. Please don't say it, April. To school. We can't risk it with Agent Bea. You don't understand what school was like. Or is like. The way this Jasmine girl makes people feel about themselves? She's mean, cruel, a bully. Doesn't care about anyone's feelings. Yeah, I can't imagine what that's like. You're not talking about me, are you? There's probably a reason why you became this Jordan. You know, maybe you have to do something differently at this age. Botox? I'm just saying... you have a chance anyone would kill for. You get to be a child again. So, knowing what you know now, what would you do different? I'd stun on those kids.

That's huge. - It's time! - Yeah. - Time for what? - Time for everything to change around here. - Yeah! - Uh-huh. Winchella auditions starting now. - No. No, no, no. - Yes!

We could really use one more dancer. - You could freestyle. - No way. I am never going on that stage and sharing myself again. I landed butt first in a stack full of cardboard boxes the last time I tried that. Next! Hi. Okay. So, what's your talent? Uh, uh, I'm-I'm-I'm singing. ♪ A-And, a-and ♪ ♪ A-And, a-an-and, a-and... ♪ A-A-And we're finished. Next! Okay, so... sometimes he gets nervous. B-But trust us, he's amazing.

Sorry. Oh! Okay, that's enough. You're in. See you all at Winchella. Awesome. Thank you. You guys are gonna be blown away. We already are. Yes. See? See what? That was a disaster. It wasn't as great as we-we-we thought it was gonna be. But that's okay. We'll totally kill it at-at-at Winchella. Right? - Yeah. - Are you crazy? She just let you into Winchella just to make fun of you. I don't know. I mean, she seemed pretty nice. Yeah, plus they won't laugh when they really see what we're about. - Forget showing who you really are. - Yeah! - That is social suicide. - Huh? - You know what? Let me teach you how to be somebody else. Somebody that a bully wouldn't dare to make fun of, because you're living a life that they can only dream of. And that can't happen here. - Oh... - I-I-I've... I-I've never skipped a second of school in my whole life. Mm-hmm. And, uh, where has that gotten you? Let's go. Whoa. Wow. - Wow. - Whoa. You live here? - This is so c-c-cool. - Whoa. - Is this what having money feels like? - Wow. Okay, guys, now, focus. This is about showing Jasmine and the rest of the school what they're missing out on by not being friends with you guys. So we have to look like we're having the most fun. Isn't it easier to... just to really have fun? Ain't nobody got time for reality. We're talking about the Internet. Okay. Um, HomeGirl, a vibe, please. HomeGirl doesn't know you. Voice recognition denied. I said, "HomeGirl, a vibe, please!" All right. Playing a vibe. Okay. So, no one's gonna be jealous of you guys looking like you. So we have to change all of this.

Forget Winchella. She's right. We can't mess this up. I've changed your life for the better. My work here is done. Your Lyft is downstairs. Thank you. - Bye. What are you doing here? I don't know, okay? I-I-I... I walked into a store, there was pink everywhere, and the next thing I know, I'm handing over my credit card, and... You... you probably don't play with toys, huh? I should have thought about this. Look, I'm-I'm nervous, okay? I just want to make a good impression on you and your mom. - Wh-Where's Jordan? - Business trip. Look, do you want me to send her a message or something? N-No. I-I mean... yes. There's just so much I want to say. But your mama just makes it so hard to talk face-to-face. Just... come in. Hey. - What is happening? - Hey. N-No, n-no. Yo, these are dope. Uh, thanks. So, you ready? Uh-huh. Uh, no. I can't do it. I can't run another pitch meeting. And it's fine. It's good. I'm good. April, you have so many dope ideas. Look at this. You know, you could really bring a team together. I can't do it like Jordan. Yes, thank God. She never lets us get our ideas out, and that's... that's including you. You're right. So, what you gonna do? I-I guess I'm gonna run it... like me? I'm sorry, I couldn't hear what you said. I said I'm gonna run it like me. I'm sorry, I-I couldn't hear you. - I'm gonna go up there... - Uh-huh. ...and run that pitch meeting like April, who's me. - Uh-huh. - And I'm gonna kill it. - You gonna kill it? - Yes! I'm gonna... up there, - I'm gonna kill it. - You gonna kill up there. - Yes. - Okay. April, when I first heard that you were leading the pitch meeting, I really only came for the bagels. But this is the first time I feel like my pitch has actually been heard. Tell me about it. I haven't even taken one of my antianxiety pills today. I mean, look at us. I mean, this is nice, right? I mean, this is, like, a very positive, like, A.A. meeting, right? Yeah. Right? Well, thank you, guys, so much. I-I'm so glad this is fun. But I have to be honest. The ideas just aren't there yet. We got to do better. Let's hear 'em! Ready to make that money! - Uh... - Is-is that...? Mr. Connor. - How long have you been here? - I don't know. I never learned how to tell time. Someone else does time for me. Well, the-the pitch isn't until tomorrow. Where's Jordan? Jordan... Can I see it? She's at home... dealing with some stuff... in her private area. That's... Whew! It is on fire. Mm. Got a hotbox down there? I've dealt with a few o' those. You said you dealt with a... a few? So, what have you got? Come on, the suspense is killing me. So, what's your plan for my mom? There is no plan. I enjoy spending time with her. Well, that can't be it. There's got to be some... angle. Well, there isn't. I see her, you know? I mean, she's only tough so no one can hurt her. But on the low... your mom is really, really silly. Like, I can't even tell you how many times I caught her goofing and dancing around here when she thought no one was watching. Mm-hmm. All right. Then let's get real. Mm. You're here for her money, huh? What? Mm-hmm. No, I'm not here for her money. I, uh... I do pretty well for myself. You're a starving artist. Yes, I am an artist. Your mom only assumes I'm starving. I actually just had a great show at the Studio Museum in Harlem. I am surprised that I... my mom didn't know that about you. Oh. I mean, how could she? Right? She never asks me anything, and... she definitely doesn't tell me much about herself. I mean, I... I didn't know about you. Then... if she's so tough, then why are you here? I care about your mom. To be that guarded... it has to be lonely. I just want her to know that, even though she may feel like she's on her own, no matter what, I truly have her back. That... is very nice to hear. You see, I could... I could do this. I can do this, right? I-I could be a great dad. You know what? This was a really good talk. How about you just give me a hug? Okay. - Yeah. - Oh, my gosh, you're so cool. I knew it. I knew we were gonna hit it off. Okay. All right. All right. Oh, oh. Okay. All right. Okay. Let go. Uh-uh. Mm-mm. Ah, wait, wait, wait. Get... Ah-ah-ah. A-All right, all right. Oh, w-wait a minute. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, no. What-what are you doing? Oh. Right. Um... No, don't. You're on time-out. You need to stay here and... Matter of fact, you go sit in the corner, you think about what you did. I-I'm gonna leave you by yourself. No, just... wait. Come back. Come on. - What's-what's her name? - Oh, it... that's April. April. April! - Hey. - Put me in your ear, and I'll tell you what to say. Time is money. Bring it. - What do you got? - April? - I got to go. - Don't you dare hang up on me! Sorry. It's... Can't hang up. It was like, "Can you hear me now?" And then it... April! Uh, the idea that we want to pitch tomorrow is called, um... It's called DiscoverEyes. It's an interactive game where you can see the world through the eyes of a child. Or, you know, we have other ideas, too. - You... She... - Mm-hmm. Right? No. That's the one I want to hear. DiscoverEyes. Dope. I'll be back in 24 hours to hear the pitch. - DiscoverEyes. - Yes. DiscoverEyes. - Sounds promising. - Yeah. - Right. DiscoverEyes. - Scott? - Yeah. You did it. We did it, guys. You did what?! I never approved DiscoverEyes. I never approved you even pitching that idea. And now my future of my whole company is gonna be running off an assistant's pitch? Well, what did you want me to do? You told me to help. You serious? Disloyal, self-serving! Huh. You did this for you, not me. Not the company. So I'm self-serving?
