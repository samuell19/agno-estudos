You should be ashamed of yourself. Yet, I'm not. ♪ You are the icing on the cake [Sam] Can you do this for our wedding? It's the perfect representation of our love. You see this silverback? That's how we met! Sam was living in Rwanda, documenting silverback gorillas to protect them from poachers. Pam came walking through the mist one day, camera in hand ready to share their plight with the world. [Both] Love is out there. [moaning] Oh, how cute. Um, so you want this whole painting on a cake? Pft, no. A cupcake. Sss, 955 cupcakes. One to represent each free silverback in the world. Yes, God, snookums, I love you. And I you, cupcake. [squeals] We would love to. Really? You are making this the most amazing day - of our lives. - Mm-hmm. Thank you. And the gorillas thank you. Only [sighs] I don't know if we can pay you the amount it says on the website. Well, that's a shame. It, it's okay, just pay us what you can. Oh, my God! I don't know how we'll ever repay you. [laughing] I love you. [jungle music] I don't know how we'll ever repay you. How about with money? [Hope] They're gonna pay what they can. Oh, oh great. Hmm, let's see, custom cupcakes still cost money. Didn't you see how in love they were? Aw, I wanted to, but I was having a hard time looking past the giant gorilla penis in that painting. Do you think she painted that herself? Why can't you just look at a couple and see how happy they are? Aw, actually, you know, I can look further. I see two incredibly attractive people celebrating their first divorce in three years. You're a cynic. And you're a dreamer. I own a place that sells a little piece of love. And I own a place that sells a little piece of the American obesity epidemic. - Mm. - Seriously? Have you hired anyone new yet? Not yet, I wanna find someone with the right heart. [groans] Oh, God, well, you better get started, because I've gotta go meet with another potential client. Hopefully this one will actually pay. Very funny. Are we still on for dinner? [Joy] Only if you're bringing food. Have fun with the cupcakes. Shit. Morgan, the Fox Hills blueprints are ready. Drop 'em off. Hey, Henry proposed, we're getting married. Oh, really? Let know when you need a good lawyer, all right? What? [Morgan] Oh, I said congratulations. Thank you! It's beautiful. Oh, I know. So you're, you said yes? Yes. That's so, that's so great. Morgan, the Howard French doors key cylinder is missing. [Morgan] Yeah, gimme a sec. Hey, hey, L.A. Fatness! Oh, did you hear? They figured out how to fry butter. Whatever, Don Draper. Nice, a handsome dig, really cuts to the core. [scoffs] I meant 'cause you're an alcoholic. Hey, I'm not the one who looks like he puts down a case of beer every night playing video games. Oh, by the way I threw out some day-old donuts on the, uh, in the break room, but they're right on top of the garbage, so you might wanna run. You're, you're the day-old donut. Good talk. - Use that. - Cool. Extra key cylinder back in the garage. All right, take care, bald Jonah Hill. Morgan, why don't you fire that guy? Oh, him? Because he's better at his job than you are. [Aaron] Better at my job than you are. Mr. James, excuse me, Mr. James. You seriously didn't get a signature? She said she wanted to see the plans first. So? So? So convince her otherwise. She specifically said no condos. So? You know what, it's fine, I'll do your job for you. Great, we hitting the club later? I'm thinking about bringing sexy back. What? And I'm bringing sexy back, it's coming back. [Jen] Morgan Eugene James! What? [Jen] Your grandfather needs to speak with you. I've got my phone on. It's your grandmother. What's with the boxes? Ooh, is Todd fired? Oh, I hope he's fired. Morgan. Okay. Tell Grandpa I'm on my way, just as soon as I fix this. Oh, no, you stay. Make yourself useful. Hit on the intern. That's what you heard, right, hit on the intern? [chuckles] Okay. Damn, I know milk does a body good, but how much you drinking, girl? I'm afraid you've wasted your time, Mr. James. I'm not selling. Look, Mrs. Pendergast, this is an amazing deal. Now look, now I, I understand... Clearly you don't. I said no teardown, and definitely no godforsaken condominiums. We had a verbal agreement. Don't speak to me about verbal agreements, Mr. James. I'm old, not stupid. Harry and Joanne Pendergast, married June 26, 1963. You two built this house with your own hands, completing construction on May 11, 1964. This house is a home. This house was everything to our family. Not every family can afford a house. This, your house, can be a home to so many families, Joanne. In fact, if you let us build here, we'll name the condo Joanne's House. We'll put a stone plaque right in the front lawn. The Pendergast House. I want it to say The Pendergast House. [cell phone buzzing] Okay, all right. [cell phone buzzing] One second. What? Yeah. Okay, Mom. I'll be there as soon as I can. Everything okay? Keep your home, Joanne. [children screaming] Watch out for my eye. All right, mad dogs, oh, hold on. Awesome, reinforcement. Come on, get in. Force fields, we got force fields. [Boy] Look out, she's not big enough - for both of us. - Watch your feet. The Bandros Bragadeer Bandits from the planet Balthazar are invading our ship again. You're never gonna take us alive! [grunts] Watch out for ricochet [grunts]. You want a beer? No. Oh, that's right, you're a girl. Wine? Sure. Ah, okay, cover me. All right, you bandits, eat laser! Run! [Boy] Run! I'm gonna get you, little bandits. I'm gonna get you, you better run, you better run! Oh no, I'm gonna get you, I'm gonna get you! Enough! All right, jeez, really? [Hope grunts] Oh! Run, you fools! [slurping] May we be excused? Yes, by all means, sleep, please. Who's ready for a bedtime story? Me! Ah, I'm gonna eat this, too, huh? Come on, let's go, go, go, go. [kids screaming] [Boy] No, I don't want to. [Boy] We don't wanna - go to bed. - All right, all right, guys, go look for the book. I'll be right back. I'm prairie doggin' [groans]. Oh, one minute, oh, there it goes. Oh, sorry about all that. It's cute. It's juvenile. He is a fun dad. He is their peer. Do you know how hard it is to get turned on by a man who's a bigger, fartier version of your kids? [Hope] Oh, no, no, stop. No, seriously, I have to think of Zac Efron just to get off. He's not that bad. I married Corey Haim and he turned into Seth Rogen. He is handsome. He's just, he has a child's heart. Right, childlike spirit, which is code for will fart under the covers and waft it in your face directly after sex. Okay, not all guys do that. They do. Not in the beginning, but they do. It's like a primal instinct. I can't tell you what my husband is feeling, but with one whiff, I can tell you what he ate. Ew, okay, gross. It's like a straitjacket for babies. He loves it, doesn't he, yes, you do. Weird. Who's my little masochist? Yes you are. Oh, mm. Oh, God, I miss booze, ah. Mm. Look how happy you were. We are. But that's not love, Sis. That's a moment in time. [toilet flushing] Ouch. Ooh. Honey, I finally lost that 20 pounds you've been wanting me to get rid of. Oh, great, great. [Hope] Oh, gross. That is love. Love is chaos and pain and poop. It's never getting enough sleep and always having something that has to get done before tomorrow. I mean, happily ever after, it's about as real as Space Pirate Pete. [melancholy music] [sobbing] I didn't get to say goodbye. I didn't get to say goodbye. [melancholy music] [Woman] Latte's up. What can I do for you? Um, uh, double shot of espresso, steamed almond milk. Already on it. Can I get a to-go cup, please? Yeah, mm-hmm. Double shot espresso, almond milk. I saw him standing there, my man of mystery. Returned again to fill up his cup. But it is my heart that yearns to pour into him. Does he see me, my man of mystery? His gaze stirs my soul. I'm overflowing with thoughts of a future unknown with my mystery man who doesn't even know my name. What can I do for you? Uh, Miss, can I get the coffee? Sorry. Um... Please? [Hope giggling] You got a lovely place here. Daydream? Stroke? Um, I just couldn't sleep - last night. - Oh, I don't know. Well, wake up, I need you to cover the event today. Uh, no, no, I hate these. Well, you're the one that said we could paint Fabio on a billion cupcakes. - But I... - No buts. Van's in the back. I'll just meet you there. Fine. [Marilyn] I'm so sorry for your loss. Oh, Marilyn, she loved you so much. [somber music] Morgan. My goodness. This is wonderful. Jan, I'm so happy you could make it. I'm, I'm happy you all made it. [sobbing] Darlene. Darlene, just hold on right there, hold that there. Hope wouldn't want to see you guys crying. Hell, the truth is, she's probably crying tears of joy right now somewhere, just looking at you wonderful people. Yeah. My granddaughter. My great grandson. No, this is a happy day. We're here to be together, to remember, to celebrate the greatest woman I've ever known. Life is not about the end result. It's how you live it, and who you live it with. I love you, Great Grandpa. I love you, squirt. I love you all. Now, I feel like I'm on a stage here and I wanna surrender this stage. I wanna leave it open to all of you, to, to feel free to share, share your stories. That's what Hope loved best. She loved stories. Junior, sit down. I'm all right. I'm all right, Dad. I love you, Dad. I love you. I love you, too, Mom. Ah, hell! I love every one of you, you're all badass. [clears throat] Right, the story. I almost forgot. Anyway, Mom played piano, and she was like an angel on that thing. She, uh, [sighs] played the Moonlight Sonata. I have that in my brain forever. ♪ Da, da, da, da, da, da, da Anyway, I would've given anything to play just one note the way she did. Remember what you said, Pop? Probably encouraged you to play the guitar. Yeah. You said it wasn't [sighs] my strong suit. But Mom believed in me, and she let me sit on her lap for a long time learning to play that thing. You see, that was Hope, that was my mom. She lived up to her name. She believed in me. Here's to you, Mom. Maybe if she was here today, I would be suited for that company that you're giving to Ned Flanders over there. Or at least it'd be going to your grandson, who I know can do it. All right, Junior. Everyone, a freer spirit there is not. [sighs] Ah, there you are, kid. Right, kid. I, I'm... When were you gonna tell me? I don't know if you realize it, but I've been a little bit preoccupied. Well, not too preoccupied to make a decision on who you're handing the family business to. It wasn't easy. No. But you told Dad and SpongeBob SquarePants, didn't you? No. Why Todd? I mean, look, look, I, I get Dad. He's a drunk. But Todd? He's a caricature. He doesn't have the balls to make the tough calls. The guy should be working in a damn cupcake shop, not running your multimillion dollar development company. You couldn't run a cupcake shop. I've watched and waited over the past year while your grandma was sick. I put you, Todd, and your dad in charge. You only ran it with your head. Yeah. You say that like it's a bad thing. Only, only with your head. Leia stole your heart. Do not bring up Leia. That's what love does. It hurts sometime, that's the price you pay. You can't close your heart forever, Morgan. I... What, what, what? You can't run this company without love. I close more projects, all right? Mm-hmm. Todd isn't even blood. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. You've got to put love into this company for my sake, if nobody else's. Todd's got that in spades. Find it, Morgan. Not everyone's as lucky as you, Grandpa. Give it a chance, kid. Morgan's my best friend and, uh, you know, I, I didn't have, like my parents weren't really involved, so Gammy played a really big role in my childhood. She used to bake all these amazing cakes and, uh, and every time I came over, we had like a different dessert to eat, and I never had dessert at my house, and maybe that's, I don't know, where I gained all these pounds. It tasted so good, though. She was such an amazing woman. I'm, I'm not good with women. - You're late. - I didn't know I was running, - Excuse me. - I'm so sorry. Davy, I didn't know - I was running this late. - Well, as usual, I saved you and your sister's ass. I love you, Davy. Girl, you love everyone. [Tim] Cared about me. And that I hope that I can find a woman in my life that can bake goods as well as the goods that she baked. Are you tray passing? No, great, replenish the dark roast. Old people need coffee. I saw the client head to the courtyard. Go let him know you're here. What? [Hope] That's the guy? No, the old guy in the front. Where are your napkins? Well, put them in your hand. Middle one's my wife. [Hope gasps] [glass shattering] Oops. [Hope] Oh. Ghosts scare you? [Hope] Oh, my God. Maybe it's a little too soon for that joke. I, I'm, I'm so sorry, you startled me. [Mr. James] Oh, now, now. Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. Oh, it's all right. I'll get you a new picture frame. Mm, no, it's all right. It's all right. Morgan James, this is my home. You've met the rest of the family. Yeah. Beautiful family. Mm-hmm. Amazing home. [Mr. James] Ah. Yeah, my sister and I are catering your party. Oh. Um, no, event. Yeah. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I said, it's not necessary, I swear. Morgan. Dave! Excuse me. Oh, I'm so happy you could fly in. Uh, uh, excuse me, Miss. I've got guests to entertain. Pleasure meeting you. [Hope] You, too. How long's it been? - Far too long, my friend. - My sister and I are catering your party. [Mr. James] Your hair was brown for starters. Moron. Miss? [Hope] Yes, yes? What's best? The cupcakes. [Mr. James] Mm. We make the best cupcakes. Well, coming from a cupcake like you, I'll follow your lead. Come on, it really means so much that you came out here. Ugh. [Mr. James] So great you could make it. How's your granddaughter? [gentle music] It was love at first sight, something seemingly extinct these days. By chance we met, through trust we overcame, with compassion, we isolated each other from loneliness, we lived as we loved, through sacrifice. We were vulnerable, old, young, strong, and soft. And through it all, I still thirst for you. You tried to flip to the end of the story, so, as promised I wrote you one. One every day of our lives. I love you and miss you, my dearest. May your next story be as amazing as the last. Eternally yours, Morgan Nathan James. You gotta be kidding me. Thanks for the fairytale, Grandpa. [gentle music] [Morgan Voiceover] Alea iacta est. The Rubicon River has been crossed and little time can be wasted. [Mr. James Voiceover] Pompeii has ordered me to disband my army and return to Rome. An order that would, without the immunity of a magistrate, assuredly seal my fate. There is no turning back now. Am I to remain in the shadow of the Great Alexander, or will my story be the one that looms over the ambitions of future great men? [Sexy Woman] Caesar, I've come to reheat your water. [grandiose orchestral music] [record scratching] Okay, Grandpa, maybe, right, that the sexy woman is Grandma. [exhales] Sexy woman. [Mr. James Voiceover] It was the most amazing feeling I'd ever felt in my life. She was a servant, and yet her lips were sweet as honey. It felt like the fire of a thousand suns going off in my chest, warm as a summer in Rome, a home I couldn't return to until this war was done. I wasn't a general that night. It was hers. She conquered the mighty Julius Caesar. She held me through the night. It wasn't lust. It was something much stronger. [exhales] [bird squawking] [speaking in foreign language] What? [speaking in foreign language] Oh, okay. [speaking in foreign language] Can you help me find her? [whooshing] [speaking in foreign language] [shrieking] [percussion music] [squawks] Catch me. Okay. [yodeling] [gentle music] See. You see, when I discovered that me is me. Not who you told me to be. See. You see, when I discovered that me is me. Not a princess, but a woman, vulnerable and soft, yet strong and bold. Yeah, man. Not too scared to be me. No, no! See, you see, when I discovered, that me is me, I discovered that I don't need you. But I want you. But we were young. Hope didn't care. Hope just loved to travel. A true spirit of the world. One time, when we were very young, Hope and I took a trip together to Argentina. Wow, look at all this, pal. This is a lot to choose from, huh? Coconut for me and one for mommy. What should we get for your sister? Worms. Worms, that's not nice for Belle. Oh, I see, worms. Wow, weirdly inappropriate for a wake, but you know what, I'll lift you up, you grab one, grab a chocolate. There you go, buddy. Oh, no, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, no, pal. No, no, it's okay, don't worry about it. I can get him cleaned up in the kitchen. [Todd] No, then I miss out on the chance to clean up my little funky monkey, no, I'll do it, that's all right. Thank you anyway. It's okay, well, what were you reaching for, chocolate? There you go. Oh, perfect. And what about for Belle? Right, worm cake. Oh, worm cake, right, there it is. Pal, let's go find Mommy, okay? - Okey-dokey. - Thank you so much. It's no problem, really. I'm sorry about the mess, appreciate it. Really, no, it's fine. [Todd] Hey, there you guys are. Sorry, he got a little messy. Go with Mommy. Ugh, are you serious? Why do they let kids come to parties? It's a wake. And he's married? You should be ashamed of yourself. What? Hitting on him. Oh, I was not hitting on him. Whatever. Can I get a cloth here, today? Love you, mean it. Hey, I was just admiring his family. [scoffs] That's not admiring. I'm pretty sure your thoughts were dirtier than that little kid's shirt. Okay, no, he is proof that guys like that exist. Honey, married people never smile that much unless they have something to hide. Just 'cause you're not married. Please, I was pissed when they passed gay marriage. When it was illegal, only straight people had the right to be miserable. Listen to your sister. I think you're wrong. There are lots of great guys out there. Whatever, don't care. Hi. Hey. Hey, I'm just, I just wanna... Yeah. Oh, sorry. Yeah. You into bald guys or... All right, I'll take that as a maybe. Text me. Nice face. [Tim] Dude, whatever. Oh, nice face. Was, uh, was Fat Efron bothering you there? 'Cause you are fine. Not like a police violation, although you could write me a ticket, consisting of 10 numbers, starting with your area code. Say, is that coffee vegan? 'Cause I, I like my coffee like I like my women. Skinny. Yeah, she wants me. [clapping] And I really don't care what anyone says, Hope kissed me deeper than any man ever could that night. [laughing and clapping] Ah, Darlene, everyone. Wow. Yeah, I knew you two loved that vacation in Argentina. I just didn't know how much. You know what I'm talking about, you lucky bastard. Yeah, every, everyone she met seemed to love Hope. So tell us how you two met. Here we go. Well, like everyone meets, chance. [banging] [Sharon] Would you stop already? You're torturing the groceries. It's not fair. No, it's not fair. The fruit in there is helpless against your attacks. I'm serious. So am I. I opened up the fridge this morning and I saw the string cheese trying to hang himself. Ha, ha, hilarious. I should've gone with the mustard gas joke. What are you evening going as anyway? Sexy Kim Jong-un. You know you're gonna look like the fat kid from Up. Come on, I have a great pickup line. Hey, you, you wanna put the dick in dictator? Ew. You need help. Sexy Kim Jong-un don't need help from anybody. Sexy Kim Jong-un supreme reader. Uh, that's disturbing. [Sharon] Get dressed. We're gonna be late for Darrell's Halloween party. I'm not going. You're not going? What do you think this is, a democracy? [Hope] No, I'm not going, I don't have a costume. You're already wearing your first world problems costume. No. Mike and I had a couples costume. I can't just show up without him. [Sharon] Please don't tell me you two were going as salt and pepper. No. Pigs in a blanket. Fine, we'll flip for it. Heads we go. Sometimes you win by losing. ["Rehab" by David Crown] Now aren't you glad you came? What? I told you this was gonna be a good party. I can't hear you. I'm gonna get us drinks! Yes, God, yes. ♪ This party don't stop till the morning ♪ This animal got no one contain Oink, oink. There's supposed to be a blanket.

No one is paying you to stand around. [Hope] Okay, you have to hear this story, it's so cute. Oh, unless it involves a six-pack and a Speedo, I don't care, mimosas. Davy, there are pigs, there's a blanket. - Go on, pass the tray. - I'll tell you later. Okay. Okay. All right, love you, mean it. Not everyone's as lucky as you, Grandpa. Can I offer you a mimosa? Oh, I'm, I'm sorry. Ba, ba, ba, I'll take one. You gonna make me drink alone? I'd love to, but I'm working, Mr. James. [scoffs] Mr. James [laughs] is my dad. Call me Junior. Besides, aren't you the boss? Um, well, yeah, I guess. Then cheers. Oh, all right. Your dad's an amazing storyteller. [laughs] Yeah. Happily ever after. What's wrong with that? Bullshit. That's what's wrong with that. Oh. Well, you're still married, so... Oh. Is that what that's for? - Yeah. - Oh. [laughing] Yeah. I still love the old bird. But it ain't a fairytale. It seems like your mom and dad had one. Exception to the rule. You know, [sighs] between living up to my parents' lives and what Disney sold me, I figure there may be a clue as to my drinking problem. But everyone's not as lucky as me. Nope. Sometimes shit happens. Sometimes a couple that's in love faces stuff. Stuff that just drives you apart. You see, sometimes, the world just don't give you the story you read. Sometimes it throws you a curve ball. No one prepares you for it. You do the best you can. You talk, try to reason with her, yourself, God. Months can go by. You try to reach her in different ways. Touch, story, song. [gentle guitar music] They wake up when they wanna, and when they do, well, sometimes, you were part of the dream they wanted out of. You lose them. [gentle guitar music] You get afraid of losing again, so you climb inside of something. You stop believing in love, stop taking chances, trusting. Loneliness sets in. See, fear of getting hurt again makes us protect ourselves, makes us forget how to sacrifice. Fear becomes the substitute for love. Wakes us up in the morning, kisses us goodnight. Gets mad at us when we [sighs] forget to pick up the milk at the grocery store. But my dad's stories are good, too. Aw, Junior. come on, sugar bear. Better get you some coffee. Come on. See, not everyone's as lucky as me. Come on. [Belle] You'll never escape my dungeon! Help, help, help! Release him or face my wrath. Oh, my. Prince? Princess Fiona. Forgive me, lady. Princess Fiona is not on the menu. You see, once upon a time, I was a great Barbarian warrior! [majestic music] [grunting] Help, help, help me! Help, somebody help! No! I'll never marry you! Oh, but you will my desert flower, but you will. I was gonna wait till our wedding night to start that, but why not do it right now. Take her to be bedded. Where? The, the, the, the rock. Just put a sheet up. I will never let a pig-dog like you touch me! [laughing] No, no, help me! My king, we're being followed. Yes, look yonder. [dramatic orchestral music] Take care of it. And you, find a softer rock. [intense music] [grunting] [birds tweeting] [sobbing] Quit pouting, my little desert flower. Soon you will be with my child, and your empire will be mine. I will never bear your child! Why, I'm like a really good guy if you get to know me. Ah! What, you're not into it? I mean, we can switch up. I'm into like role reversals and just exploring a little bit, and I don't... My king. What, you fool, I'm wooing her! He is still coming. [Hope] Yay! Well then, stop him! [yells] [grunting] [whimpering] [Man] Oh, my beard. [knuckles cracking] [grunting] [yelling] [thudding] Ooh. No! Yay! [intense music] You're my hero! How can I ever repay you? Your safety is my thanks. Great Grandpa, it didn't happen like that. Aw, shucks. You got me. Well, it was actually more like this. Help, help, help! Help, somebody help me, please, help! [Mr. James] Sometimes we aren't the hero. Sometimes we all need saving and protection. Sometimes it comes from someone we least expect. You'll do, the boys are in the back. [dramatic music] [Man] Put the money on the table. [dramatic music] [door slamming] [zipper zipping] [groaning] [grunting] [gun firing] [Morgan] Oh, my God. [Man] She's in the back room. [whimpering] You like action movies, Morgan? [Man] What's going on, open the door right now. Yeah. Well, you're about to - live in one. - Open this door, - what's going on in there? - Only you've got one take - and no stunt doubles. - Open this door right now. You're gonna open that door, and we're gonna make a run for it. Are you crazy, why don't we wait for the cops? You're looking at them. Open the door on my signal. You ready? Okay. Scene one, take one. [Man] We're breaking this door down. - Get back. - Action. [Man] Break it down, break it down, let's go! [gun firing] [screaming] Wait here. [grunting] [panting] [laughing] [gun fires] [grunting] [crashing] [laughing] [grunting] Oh, what the? [grunting] [thudding] [grunting] [suspenseful music] Wait a minute, wait, is she okay? Is she gonna get out all right? [Morgan] Oh, please don't hit me. You okay? Wow. I'm Hope. I'm Morgan. Tell us another one. Yes, a romance this time. Something beautiful. Ah, yes, of course. I have a very special one for that. [Morgan Voiceover] Morgan stumbled through the manual of his new speed boat. He was strangely annoyed for a man with a new boat, while his friends slowly boarded, ready for an amazing cruise around the cove. You know, most people buy cars at their midlife crisis. I am not at mid-life. And you know nothing about the ocean. It's amazing what you can learn by reading, and besides, it's, it's a cove. I mean, It's not like we're boating to the Caribbean. - Avast, ye mateys. - Wow. Check out my new boating duds. Could you please just get the rum stored away in the, uh, uh... There? Right. You know nothing about this boat, and you've never learned to swim. This is gonna be awesome, man, this is gonna be great. Whatever, get the rum stored away. You're gonna get seasick. All right, Captain Pissy Pants. What about ye, sea wench? Mutiny. Here, have a bagel. Oh, now you be speaking to me heart. Just go to the bow. Be ready to take the rope off. The, the what? Bow. Yar. Oh, the front, just say the front, stupid. Morgan, this boat's amazing. Why'd you buy it? Ha, me thinks to make up for the size of his mackerel. Oh, God. Just, uh, you know, always wanted one. Just never had the right motivation, though. Oh, yeah? Wait, what, what was that motivation again? Ah, just... Oh, my God, it's a girl. That'd be a first. No. Oh, does she love the ocean? Did you buy the boat to whisk her off to an island? Feed her pineapple by the beach? Oh, God [retching]. Hey, hey, guys, there's dolphins. That's good luck, right? Yeah, yeah, seems to be working great for you, man. Dude, why didn't you just bring her? He can't, she got married. Ah... Well, why didn't you stop her, tell her how you feel? 'Cause he took too long. He tried a couple of times, never pulled the trigger. Wrote her those love letters though, didn't you? Guys, I don't wanna freak anybody out, but they're following us. Are, are they vengeful creatures? You should've told her. Did you send the love letters? No, I was... I was waiting for the right time. Oh, my gosh, there's, there's like, never, ever a right time. He waited for five years while she dated the same guy. You never made a move, man. Well, there are plenty of fish in the sea. Some he hasn't puked on yet. Technically, dolphins aren't, oh, God. [Tim retching] So you're just never gonna trust your heart again? Well, he's gotta learn to trust himself first. [Morgan Voiceover] Morgan was hurt from his last love. Flooded with memories of her, he needed to step away. He went to the front of the boat to remember the dreams they once shared. [gentle music] [splashing] Morgan hears a splash and wakes up from his daydream. [Morgan] Guys. Guys. [panting] Yeah? You're not gonna believe what I just saw. I, I, I, I, I... I just saw a fish. Oh, my God. Funny place for that, did you get a picture? Yeah, was it, uh, was it one of my barphins? Was it seeking revenge? Did it, did it leave a note? I, I think it was a mermaid. What? Oh, my gosh. [laughing] Sweetheart, that's not what I meant when I said plenty of fish in the sea. Morgan, Morgan, do this. Why don't you write this beautiful mermaid a letter and then wait like five years to give it to her. Ah! I got you! [laughing] I was drifting off, um... Ah, it was probably one of those killer dolphins. Barphin, all right, I'm combining dolphin with barf. We get it. Are you okay, man? Yeah, I'm fine, just, uh, let me get the helm. I'll get us there in 20 or 30 minutes. Good. Let's get you in town for some dinner. That should clear your head. We're gonna need a bigger boat [chuckles]. [mystical music] [Aaron] Well, here she be. [Tim] Is that a tree house? [thumping] We're okay. You know, I think I'm just gonna sleep out under the stars tonight. Dude, why? Come on, man, the night is young. Nah, I'm good. Are you sure? I'm positive. You're gonna pass up a nice big feather bed? And some blackjack? Nah, stars are gonna be calling my name real soon. I'll crash under them. Beware the barphin! All right, well, I guess good night then. You gonna hang by the dock? Don't know yet. Okay. Well, enjoy yourself. Yeah, you, too. Hey, Morgan, I hope you don't mind, I grabbed a couple cigars. I wasn't sure which one I'd like. Is that cool? Yeah, you knock yourself out. Just, uh, keep an eye on those two, all right? Aye-aye, Cap'n. [Morgan Voiceover] With no cigars left and less than a taste of rum remaining, Morgan found his way to his old box of letters, the letters he never had the courage to send. Coward. With a heavy heart, Morgan drifted off to sleep. Alone. [somber music] [Kacey] So you're just never gonna trust your heart again? [Aaron] Well, he's got to learn to trust himself first. [Kacey] Well, there are plenty of fish in the sea. [Aaron] Well, he's got to learn to trust himself. [Kacey] That's sad. So you're just never gonna trust your heart again? [Aaron] He's got to learn to trust himself first. [Kacey] So you're just never gonna trust your heart again? [Mr. James] Leia stole your heart. You can't close your heart forever, Morgan. You can't run this company without love. [sniffling] Find your heart. Right, okay, need love to run a business, right? [sniffling] You need love to run a business. I had it! [crashing] [gentle piano music] The sphere, if traveled around, has no end. Let this be a symbol of our love. [gentle piano music] [Hope] April 24th. [gentle piano music] [Morgan] April 24th. [gentle piano music] [water splashing] You're not gonna drown me, are you? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, come back, please! Trust your heart. [Morgan Voiceover] He decided to trust his heart and take a leap of faith. Come back, please come back! [gasps] You're out of your boat. You left. You're not scared of me? No. [chuckles] I'm Hope. I'm Morgan. So many old tales. So many old friends. Mm. Yeah, Hope would've cherished today, people sharing stories, sharing love. Tell us her favorite story. I, I don't think it would be appropriate for the day. Do you have a better day planned? Well, no, I guess not, yeah. Uh, you see, Hope always believed that there was someone out there, someone for all of us. She believed with every part of her being in soul mates. Two hearts that are one, no matter the time, no matter the place. [Morgan Voiceover] She believed that souls attract each other, she believed that all you have to do is open up your heart. She believed that all you have to do is give your heart permission to let them in. I'm Hope. I'm Morgan. Do you wanna go for a walk or something? Yeah. [Morgan Voiceover] Such a simple act leads to so much more. [gentle piano music] But sometimes in life, those that we love most can hurt us most, and we lose more than we think we can stand. [gentle piano music] Where am I? [Man] You know. Where's Morgan? [Man] He stayed behind. We didn't have enough time. [Man] How much time would be enough? [Hope] All of it. [Man] And would that be enough? I wanna go back. [Mr. James] If you'll excuse me. Please don't! Please stay! How did it end? Hope. She came back as a different person. Same soul. We still recognized each other. How did the real story end? Same as it began. How? With a story. The real story. Yeah. The real story. [Morgan Voiceover] I just closed my first deal, and the boys took me out for drinks to celebrate. I was young and naive, but ready to take the world by storm. I didn't know what the future would hold, and then I saw her. My heart almost popped out of my chest. We locked eyes, and it's almost as if the rest of my life gazed right back at me. She stole my heart. [Morgan Voiceover] And the boys could tell I liked her, so naturally, they took me to her table. I was nervous, but my buddies talked me up, telling her that I was a successful businessman, and I had a secret passion for writing. Spent a whole night trying to get me to tell her a story. A story! To be honest, I, I was scared to death to tell her one. What if my stories weren't any good? So we ate. She just kept nagging at me. What a pain in the ass. Tell me a story. And we danced. Tell me a story. And we drank. Tell me a story. Tell me a story. And several martinis later, and I'm minimizing the number of martinis, I was kissing the sexiest broad in the whole bar. [Morgan] Morning. Good morning. Oh, God, you're leaving. I suppose I'm just flipping to the end of the book. Please don't. Please stay. Tell me a story. I'll tell you a story every day of your life. Just stay. I don't even know your name [giggles]. [Both] It was loud. I didn't catch yours, either. I'm Hope. I'm Morgan. [laughing] [gentle piano music] Romance isn't always what you think it is, but it's out there. And when you find it, as you surely will do, even though there are bumps in the road, everything's not storybook, you remember that. In fact, in the end, it's, uh, absolutely certain that one of you will have to finish the last chapter alone. Is it worth it? A thousand times over. A thousand times over. Now, if you'll excuse me, my dear, I believe I have a story to finish. He responds, "I'm Morgan." The moment isn't technically perfect, but it is perfect. Jesus. There you are. I started breaking down the tables. Is there anything else you want taken down? Actually, put everything back up. Keep this going as long as people are telling stories. Okay, but your sister's gonna be pissed. We are selling a little piece of love. I thought we were selling diabetes, but okay. Now's not the time, son. I got this, Dad. I got it. Hi, um... Glad to see you all made it out. A lot of people think I'm an ass. Yeah, they do. [laughing] Okay, I had that one coming, I had that one coming. But, um, you all aren't here for me, no. You're here because two wonderful people shared so much with you. Not because they fell in love and lived happily ever after. No, that's cute. You're here because, because they chose to love each other each and every day, no matter how hard it got. See, somewhere along the way, I forgot that lesson. I forgot what I learned from my grandma. See, I forgot that every day, every day is a gift. It is a chance to open your heart up to the world, or to close it. Open it, baby! That's right! Open it up, open it! That's right, Darlene. Now I look out and I see all of you amazing people, sharing your heart with my family today. Thank you. Um... Grandpa? You're right. I can't run this company without love. I, I can't. You picked the right guy. Todd should run the company. Todd has love in spades, don't you, Mr. Rogers? And Rob, Rob's right, too. I have been a bit of an ass. How'd you like your job back? Your grandpa already gave me my job back. [gentle piano music] Well, how would you like mine? You okay? I'm great, Grandpa. Well, what are you gonna do? I'm gonna go sell cupcakes. What? Oh, and Grandpa, you're an amazing writer. Grandma was a lucky woman. My God. Oh. Hi. Hi. Are you still hiring? Um, yeah. Yeah, we are. Your sister's on the phone and she wants to talk to you right now. - Hope, are you serious? - Hope! [Joy] Listen to me, I'm over here slaving away like Michelangelo on these cupcakes, and you're gonna extend the event? You need to get back here. Hope, Hope, are you even listening? Hope, Hope, Hope? Wait, um, I've stopped by your shop like a hundred times, I mean, I, I should've asked your name. You are not gonna believe what I just read. You're... Hope. Yeah. And you're... Morgan. Yeah.
