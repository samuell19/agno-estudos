Rat traps. Be careful, they'll snap your toes off. I can't stay. Kate Hudson is opening a pottery store. But Christine Walsh from {\i1}Parade{\i0} is coming by tonight to interview you, so you need to be on your best behavior. Don't try flirting. The love of men is alien to her. Just stick to the script. Gary? Yeah? What is the script? It was a one-time bender. Because? Because the love of my life betrayed me. I was heartbroken and emotionally devastated. And how do you feel today? Incredibly lucky to be alive and have this chance to fix my mistakes. Are you wearing cologne? No. Yes. Gary. You know you don't have to impress me. Hi. Five right there. There you go. No, {\i1}Crime Lab.{\i0} I think they solve murders using chemistry or something. Look, Marilyn, I gotta go. Call you later. Tape one, Christine Walsh for {\i1}Parade{\i0} magazine, interviewing Gary Banks, B-A-N-K-S. {\i1}So I had to explain{\i0} to Christine Walsh of {\i1}Parade{\i0} magazine, No, my client's not gay! He's heteroflexible! And incredibly lazy. He'd fuck Alf if he rang the bell." I'm sorry. A celebrity apologizing? Can you fix it? Make it go away? What--do you think I'm some sort of mastermind? I think you already did fix it. You just want me to feel bad, and I do. Look, whatever you did, however you did it... thank you. Fucker. Demon liquor. And the best part is, I can drink it. I pumped before I came. So did I. Nice house. It's not mine. I know. It belongs to the universe. Possession is illusion. Voltaire? Me. Vaguely Buddhist intellectual posturing. I like it. I know I asked for it, but motherhood is a cult. A cult? Yeah, it has all the classic characteristics-- sleep deprivation, repetition of meaningless sounds, laser focus on unachievable goals. Like, right now, we're trying to get Jaden into Wagon Wheel. The fuck is Wagon Wheel? Only, like, the best preschool. It feeds into the Center. Which sounds very culty. I don't want to talk about mom stuff. That makes two of us. Wow. That was complicated. That's impressive. -You can have that. -Okay. {\i1}Et voila.{\i0} -Your turn. -Pass. Come on. No, I'm crippled. Gary, your small penis is no handicap in hopscotch. You gunning for a rematch? No, it's just-- It's fine. Are you feeling lunchy? Yeah. -I feel so dirty. -That's how I like it. I like that one. {\i1}How are you doing{\i0} {\i1}with your reading?{\i0} I think we got 15 new scripts this morning. {\i1}Okay, don't read anyone{\i0} {\i1}below supervising producer.{\i0} I got a system going. My system is that I don't read anything until Susan forces me to meet with someone. First off, I'm terrible at the interview process. I hate it. If I may say, {\i1}Knowing{\i0} is a terrific project. -Thank you. -I mean, it's so well-written. Yeah, it's close to me. Scarily close. Did it come from some place in your own life? I mean, I know it's dark subject matter-- I can't really tell whether I'm obsessed with the project or the project's obsessed with me. It's sort of like I'm really having trouble delineating what that line is. I feel like my real life exists only to gather material for this show. Somebody'll say something, and I'm thinking, "How can I use that?" You have to. It's your show. It's like your child. You have to become obsessed with it. I feel I'm responsible for maintaining this alternate universe 24-7 in my head, and if I stop thinking about it-- and I mean even for a moment-- it'll just all go away. I'm gonna tell you something quite blunt. Please. Shows that I have been on, the people who run the show had nervous breakdowns because it is so stressful, but I think if you have a support system-- Susan Howard's been great that way. I've had such a great experience with her so far. I'm-- I know that you've worked with her before, and I don't know what that experience was like, but I just-- For me, she's been great. I think she's definitely gonna have our backs. Have they tested it yet? We haven't tested yet. We're testing tomorrow. Could Dahlia do it? Absolutely. She's terrific. It could work. I don't know if I want it to work. I got to see some of Toronto, which was beautiful. We weren't actually in Toronto, but we were just outside of it in the forest, and just-- just these wide open... Kirsten mentioned in her e-mail that you're going on sabbatical. Yeah, I get off between now and January. Oh, my God. Yeah, no, I mean, it's the great thing about the academic life. Yeah. Wow. The only other word that starts sounding better is "emeritus." Yeah. Of course. I can't imagine what it must be like for you to have to think of all those things at the same time when you're running a show. Yeah, it certainly is all-consuming. It's--a sabbatical is something that would be absolutely lovely. So, when you're doing all of the different-- I mean, when you're producing and scouting location and dealing with the network and stuff, how does the writing go? Good. I'm--the writing's really-- effortless. There's poison in your drink. No, what I mean to say is that-- See, I don't feel like I'm doing anything. I feel like-- I feel like I'm just an observer documenting what's happening. I can tell you what everybody's wearing, the color of the leaves. It feels more real than sitting here talking to you. Maybe it is real. Multiple dimensions, string theory. Would--explain string theory? In the end, it all gets tangled. -And the more you try to untangle it... -The worse it gets. Yeah. Makes you appreciate why God made scissors. You're saying cut my losses. {\i1}My conversation with Howard{\i0} {\i1}went really well.{\i0} All our friends are really nice gay men. So, easy to get along with gay men. They're, you know, nice guys. More considerate, probably. {\i1}If you are lonely, then you will know{\i0} {\i1}When someone needs you, you love them so{\i0} Melissa is doing some kind of musical thing in between. I think it's a one-woman show. I'm not really sure. The only thing I'm sure about is that I'm about to fire my best friend. I'm about ready to jump off a cliff. Always fun. Never a dull moment. {\i1}If you are lonely, {\i0} {\i1}then you will know{\i0} {\i1}If someone needs you{\i0} {\i1}You love them so{\i0} Honey, who were you talking to? No one, I guess. Noelle wants her bunny. You coming to bed? -Think I'll stay up. -'Kay. Love you. Love you too.
