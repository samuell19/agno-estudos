A cemetery on Long island, in the state of New York. There is a grave here like many others around it. With nothing unusual or distinctive. And yet, it holds the key to one of the Second World War's biggest mysteries. In capital letters, the gravestone bears a name that has masked the truth for historians. "Stuart Houston... Rest in Peace, Brigid Elisabeth, William Patrick." The family named carved in stone should be: Hitler. Brigid Hitler, wife of Alois Hitler, Adolf Hitler's brother. An unwanted legacy passed down to her son. For the latter part of his life, he attempted to escape from his own patronymic. Because of his uncle, Adolf Hitler, who died in a bunker in Berlin in 1945, and whose memory still haunts the nightmares of millions around the world. William Patrick managed to conceal his secret, but could never avoid the reality of being part of the Hitler dynasty. Is William Patrick Stuart Houston the last of the Hitlers? In order to find out, I shall have to delve into the past of the most hated man in history. THE PACT The story of WPH begins in Liverpool, where he was born on March 12th 1911, the son of Brigid and Alois Hitler, Adolf Hitler's elder brother. The history of the British branch of the Hitlers resides in this birth certificate, and a few lines written by a civil service registrar. Testimony to Alois Hitler's life in the UK. The Hitlers were a complex family, with multiple marriages and remarriages. Alois and his sister Angela were the eldest, half brother and sister to Adolf and Paula. They all shared the same father, Alois senior, but did not have the same mother. Alois and Angela's mother was Franziska. Adolf and Paula were born to Klara, Alois senior's last wife. They were brought up together over several years. Alois senior was a customs official. He was authoritarian and violent towards his children. He died in 1903, Klara in 1907. After moving to the UK and marrying an Irish woman, Bridget Dowling, Alois settled in Liverpool, then one of England's biggest industrial centres, with the world's largest port, and a haven for immigrants from around Europe. Alois built up contacts in the German community, and the future WP's father attempted to make money by running a small restaurant in Dale Street, a boarding house in Parliament Street and a hotel at Mount Pleasant, all of which failed. He was too eccentric to succeed in business. Alois and his wife lived in Toxteth, a working-class suburb of Liverpool. They lived here, at 102 Upper Stanhope Street. In 1913, Alois set up another project, in which he had high hopes: creating a safety-razor company, and commercialising its products across Europe. He explained his adventurous plans to Bridget. At the end of 1913, Alois left Liverpool and went to Germany. Soon after, in the summer of 1914, World War One broke out. Alois disappeared, without leaving an address. Florian Beierl is an historian, specialising in the Hitlers. For years, he has been tracking down clues and evidence relating to the family history. We don't know what he did during the 1st World War. We do know that he was in Berlin that time. But there is no strict record of what Alois Hitler was exactly doing at that period of time. Alois apparently had no contact with his family, and notably his brother, Adolf, about whom we do have historical details. When war was declared, Adolf left Austria and was seen in Germany, in this crowd photo taken in Munich city centre, in Bavaria. He was a simple army private, but after barely escaping death, was promoted to corporal and became a dispatch runner. At the end of the war, in 1918, he stayed on in the army, in the political chaos of post-war Germany. Embittered by the country's failure, he joined the German Workers' Party. In 1920, he helped transform the party into the National Socialist German Workers' Party, and became its leader in 1921. Hitler himself chose the swastika as the party's emblem and created a paramilitary group, the SA stormtroopers. Meanwhile, back in Liverpool, alone, with no news of her husband, Bridget was trying to cope. She joined a dance troop. William Patrick attended primary school in Toxteth, an English schoolboy like any other. In 1919, Bridget finally received news from a friend: Alois had died during the war. In reality, Alois Hitler met another woman in Germany, Hedwig Heidemann, and they were married in 1916. Alois and Hedwig had a child in 1923, a boy named Heinz. Alois was a father for the second time. His English son, William Patrick was already 13 years old. But Alois's ruse was discovered by the German authorities, and as a bigamist, he risked prison. British historian Mike Unger has closely studied the relations between Alois and Bridget. He wrote to Bridget asking her to divorce him and she said "No". He wrote her again saying "Would you give me a letter of credibility, because if you don't, I will go to jail." and she felt sorry for him, didn't want him to go to jail, so she did this letter. As Alois faced judicial problems in Germany, his brother Adolf launched a coup d'état in Munich in November 1923. There were 16 casualties. Hitler was wounded by the police and arrested two days later. The party was banned and he was accused of high treason. His trial was held in Munich in early 1924 and he was sentenced to 5 years in prison. Adolf Hitler was incarcerated at Landsberg prison, but stayed there barely 9 months. It was here that he dictated to his secretary, Rudolf Hess, the first draft of Mein Kampf. In just a few months, Hitler became a household name in Germany. LIVERPOOL ENGLAND Bridget and William Patrick moved to London, renting a small house in Highgate, a northern suburb. She soon found work as a teacher at a dance school. William Patrick began an apprenticeship as an accountant in a company in central London. It was here that the first public photo of William Patrick appeared. The only known photo from the period. In Germany, the economic crisis of 1929 caused chaos. Nazi party meetings attracted ever larger audiences. Hitler chose Nuremberg for the party congress, and not by chance. The medieval city was the perfect setting to exalt Germany's past glory and embody the project for the Nazi Reich to come. Frank McDonough is an historian specialising in the Hitler family. Hitler stages these grand Nuremberg rallies where he appears in front of hundred thousand people. And people who were at these rallies have left behind memoirs of what they felt. They say it looked like some kind of religious experience. The second Nazi Party congress in Nuremberg in August 1929 was the scene of the first Hitler reunion since the family separated in the early days of the century. Alois and his family were invited by his brother to take part in the Nazis' first great rally. Alois invited his son, William Patrick, to attend. He was 18 years old, and it was the first time he'd seen his father since 1913. I have found a letter from William Patrick to his mother, recounting his experience in Nuremberg. I had heard a great deal about Nuremberg. I was looking forward to seeing it almost as much as Uncle Adolf. But in fact, all I saw was flags. They were everywhere, and they hid everything. I heard Uncle Adolf make a speech. There must have been 30,000 men there, all in uniform. Father went to talk to Adolf, and I hoped to get the chance too. But when he returned, father said it was impossible, as Uncle Adolf didn't want to mix family and business. I think obviously, when WP goes to visit Hitler, he stands there not just his uncle, he stands into this as an international celebrity who is totally mesmerizing when he speaks, totally charismatic and he has thousands of people supporting him. So obviously William Patrick was mesmerized by this. He now knows he is part of a family with an amazing member. Anyone would be amazed to see Hitler at this time, and I think he's amazed too, he wants to go and join in what's happening in Germany. It seems as though it's very exciting and of course he is related to him. Adolf Hitler was now totally invested in his pursuit of power. On January 30th 1933, at around midday, he finally achieved his aim, and was appointed Chancellor. The same evening, his militia paraded triumphantly before their new leader. This dramatic ascension affected every member of his family. In London, William Patrick was sacked by the accounting firm, Benham &amp; Sons, as his surname was an embarrassment. Encouraged by his mother, he decided to try his luck in Germany. I think you can interpret everything WPH does as opportunism, but remember, he is a family member, this is his uncle. Everybody has an uncle. Why shouldn't he want to actually get closer to him just from a personal perspective? So it's easy to sort of dismiss WPH as he is being dismissed by lots of historians. A young man on the make, trying to latch on to a celebrity to make money. But this might not be true. It might be that he genuinely wanted to join in in what was happening in Germany and to get closer to his uncle. And maybe also to see his father, Alois, who actually lived in Germany as well. BERLIN GERMANY In Berlin, he received 500 marks from his uncle, and the promise of a job as a sales coordinator with Great Britain for the Berlin department store, Defaka. Otto Schlepper worked for the same store. The Nazi party appointed him as William Patrick's chaperone. He is the only living witness to William Patrick's life in Berlin at the time. He recalls one episode in particular which illustrates Hitler's nephew's behaviour during this period. I saw him at a Defaka company party. William Patrick had been invited. The company organised fabulous receptions. This one took place in a grand hall at the Land Volker casino, near the Banhoff zoo. He danced with a number of women. The problem was that he used very inappropriate words when he said what he wanted to do with them. Clearly, his knowledge of German was not up to scratch. The story obviously spread quickly among the women in the company. For the next dance, the women chose their partners. A very attractive department head, asked him to dance. She explained to him that the words he was using were very vulgar. William Patrick Hitler understood that it was improper to use a certain word in German, which means both "to kiss" and "to screw". He asked her what he could say. And she, being a bit of a bitch, gave him another word, which was even worse. So WP was persona non grata with all the women at the party. After that, I lost touch with him. He didn't last long in the company. The Nazis had him sacked for his behaviour. William Patrick was clearly behaving opportunistically. He took advantage of his family connections, and believed he could do as he liked, which displeased his uncle and the Nazi party. In 1933, Adolf Hitler's entire family gravitated towards the seat of power. His sisters were in Bavaria. Alois opened a wine bar in Berlin with his wife. William Patrick soon found a job in a Berlin bank, the Reichkredit, where he was employed as an accountant. In Germany, Hitler's coming to power was a boost to morale. Optimism returned. Berlin was once more a leading world capital, and the scene of festivities. But they served as a smokescreen. The economy was reborn through re-armament. The cult of leadership and Nazi ideology... all of German society was submitted to mass indoctrination through the media. The first measures of exclusion affected the Jews, designated as the principal enemies. In this context came the violence of the Night of the Long Knives. For a while, the SA, so valuable in Hitler's conquest of power, had been a thorn in his side. During the night of June 29th-30th, Hitler and his new militia, the SS, brutally assassinated dozens of SA members, including their leader. On the evening of June 29th, William Patrick was sitting on the terrace of the Kranzler café when an SS patrol appeared. They controlled every customer, clearly looking for someone. When WP showed his ID papers, an SS officer said: "The Fuhrer's name must not be used for stupid games. I suppose you are pretending to be related to the Fuhrer." William Patrick replied that he was his nephew. He was arrested and taken to Lichtenfeld, a prison camp in the Berlin suburbs. Here, he asked if he could call Rudolf Hess, to confirm his identity, but the British embassy intervened for his release. William Patrick wrote: "I am sure I was on a list. otherwise I wouldn't have been arrested, and especially not in a café where I went every day." And his problems were far from over. On several occasions, William Patrick attempted to send money to his mother in London, who required his assistance. In October 1934, he was summoned to see Hitler. He wrote: "My uncle was in an ugly mood. He said my mother was an able-bodied woman, and that I could send no money out of the Reich, to her or to anybody else. Then, with a curt 'Heil', he turned on his heel and swept out." After these refusals, William Patrick decided to send a threatening letter to his uncle. It was found among correspondence belonging to his aunt Angela, by historian Florian Beierl. Dated November 29th 1934, it was addressed to Julius Schaub, Hitler's right-hand-man. One extract says: "I intend to make a declaration to the British press, so that my situation becomes more secure. I have to accept that there is a conflict between me and my uncle." The very next day, William Patrick was summoned to the Chancellery and presented to his uncle. When he returned to work the next morning, he discovered his salary had been doubled, and that he'd received a bank draft of 100 marks. MONEY TRANSFER 100 MARKS What else was in the letter that could have been of concern to Adolf Hitler, the most powerful man in Germany? Well that is where it gets a little bit murky because he is sort of suggesting that he might bring out some kind of revelation about Hitler being Jewish, which of course would be a bomb shell. The man who really hates Jews, the man who has built his all reputation on anti-Semitism and who was introducing a wide range of anti-Semitic laws, turns out to be Jewish. So obviously there is a little bit of blackmail threat there and he doesn't really like that. Did WP really possess compromising information about the family? Perhaps pertaining to his uncle's Jewish origins? Adolf Hitler feared any revelations about his family, which he kept in the background. He knew his nephew had led an investigation into the subject in Austria, several years earlier. Hitler commissions Hans Frank, who is a key legal lawyer within the Nazi Party movement, to go and investigate this whole issue: Did Hitler have some Jewish ancestry? And this was a highly secret report. Apparently, Frank found nothing compromising during his thorough research. Yet Hitler remained wary and preferred to give in to his nephew's blackmail. If you decided to blackmail Adolf Hitler, your chances of survival were not very big. In the case of WPH, it's remarkable that Hitler refrained from any dictatorial action that would have been typical for that period of time. William Patrick was a nuisance to both Adolf Hitler and his own father, Alois, who kept him at a distance. Alois opened a restaurant called "Alois" in Wittenberg Platz, only a few minutes-walk from various places frequented by his son. He had bought the restaurant for a pittance from a Jew he had had evicted. Unable to join his uncle's inner circle, and to reap the benefits, William Patrick had to work. Between 1935 and 1937, he worked for Opel, at first in a factory in Russelheim for several months, and later in Berlin, where he was employed by the prestigious Opel dealer, Eduard Winter. He was once again hassled by the authorities. The Gestapo blocked his work permit for two months. Opel was obliged to fire him. The police accused him of selling cars under the name of Hitler. He found work in a Berlin restaurant until January 31st 1939. The next day, he left Germany. It would appear that his departure was sudden. WW2 had not yet broken out, but Germany had been geared up for war since 1938, and the annexation of Austria and Sudetenland. Historians have theories regarding possible threats and pressure applied to William Patrick. By 1939, certain dynamics must have evolved that prompted William Patrick Hitler to take off, to leave Germany. Maybe he knew something about the war preparations, maybe he was threatened by the Gestapo. He must have been advised by people around him, that what he was doing was ultimately going to lead to a pretty bad end. The version he gives for his departure is connected to the blackmail of his uncle Adolf. If he wanted to stay in Germany, he would have to change nationality: become German, or leave the country for good. He chose the latter option. WP had just signed a contract with an American agent representing the Hearst media group. He and his mother left London for Le Havre, where they set sail on board the Normandie in March 1939. William Patrick and his mother enjoyed a luxurious crossing on the period's finest ocean liner: a 6 day first-class cruise, paid for by his agent. He arrived in New York on March 30th 1939 at dawn, and was enchanted. At the time, the USA were isolationist, but the Americans were curious about the Hitler phenomenon, widely covered in the nation's press. In the days following his arrival, numerous articles were devoted to him around the country. William Patrick and his mother were also filmed. A very rare document of just a few seconds, but which reveals something of his personality. I hope the American people in this country will not be kidded by my moustache, because, after all, my heart is in the right place. He became a curiosity in a country hungry for novelties. His joke about his moustache endeared him to the public. He and his mother were taken under the wing of the prestigious William Morris agency, and housed in the Buckingham Hotel, near Central Park. Hitler's nephew signed a contract for a lecture tour lasting several months around the USA, focusing on his uncle and the Nazi regime. William Patrick was relying on his new-found fame to find a lasting place in the American dream. In Europe, widespread conflict had been imminent since Hitler invaded Poland. This increased the appeal of the Fuhrer's nephew's presence in the USA. For three years, he gave lecture after lecture across the country. He spoke of Adolf Hitler, the Nazis, Rudolf Hess and the other dignitaries he had met during his stay in Germany. His name became his stock-in-trade. Some of his lectures became famous, such as the one in Boston, where his presence caused a riot. But over the months, the interest dwindled. After speaking in prestigious halls, he had to make do with colleges and reading clubs. At the end of 1941, his constant movements around the country, and a request to prolong his and his mothers' visas aroused the attention of the FBI. The FBI archives contain a file on William Patrick and one on his mother. They were declassified and made available to the public in the mid-90s. They reveal that J. Edgar Hoover, the FBI director, closely followed the movements and declarations of Hitler's nephew. With addresses and profiles and biographical detail, the files are succinct but very precise. Apparently, in mid-November 1941, there was no reason to refuse a visa extension. Since Great Britain entered the war in September 1939, William Patrick and his mother led a media support campaign. Bridget Hitler joined the British Red Cross in New York. William Patrick talked of joining the Canadian army. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7th 1941 changed the course of the war, and the life of Hitler's nephew. The American fleet was partially wiped out. The day after the attack, President Roosevelt declared war on Japan. On the 11th, Germany and Italy declared war against the USA. The war was now worldwide. William Patrick and his mother decided to stay in their new home country. On March 14th 1942, J. Edgar Hoover received a priority memo from President Roosevelt's cabinet at the White House. It contained astonishing news. WPH had written to the President, expressing his desire to join the American army. In a letter, never mentioning his uncle's name, he explained to Roosevelt he wanted to fight under the American flag, but it was impossible, due to his British nationality. Because of his name, neither Canada nor Great Britain were willing to accept him in their armed forces. So he pleaded with the President to help him enlist in the US Army. The letter immediately triggered a major FBI investigation, mobilizing several agents from the New York bureau. The enquiry took a certain amount of time. In March 1942, William Patrick was interviewed by agents from New York, as this document shows. He then took part in a top secret investigation carried out in 1942 and 43 by Bill Donovan, the director of the OSS, the forerunner of the CIA. This investigation, led by psychiatrist Walter Langer, aimed to establish a psychological profile of Adolf Hitler. Marc Sageman, a former CIA profiler, knows the case well. His knowledge of his uncle became a national priority and I think Walter Langer volunteered to do a study of Hitler. At the time, it was really the height of psychoanalysis. People actually thought that it was a science that could predict people's behaviour. So they thought it was worthwhile and they allocated some money for this project and Walter Langer went around and interviewed quite a few people who knew Hitler. Also, he had a team of researchers looking at all kinds of documents, all kinds of newspapers, articles about Hitler, but one of the people interviewed was William Patrick Hitler. After two interminable years of waiting, keen to do battle against his uncle, William Patrick Hitler finally got what he wanted. The American authorities gave the dictator's nephew the go-ahead. He could join the US Navy. On March 6th 1944, he was called to the Manhattan recruitment office at 88 Vanderbilt Avenue for enlistment. Exceptionally, cinema newsreels were present to record the scene, as if William Patrick were a star. He swore allegiance, and became the object of US propaganda. Only living descendant of the Hitler family bearing that name, and I expect shortly to enter the US Navy. As a member of the Armed Forces, I hope to take an active part in the liquidation of this man, my uncle, who has unleashed such misery upon the world. It was a declaration of war against his uncle. Adolf Hitler's reaction is unknown, but such images would have warranted the firing squad for high treason against his family. William Patrick was posted to a medical unit until 1946. On April 30th 1945, uncle Adolf committed suicide in his bunker in the Chancellery. Germany capitulated, unconditionally, on May 8th. William Patrick's father, Alois, barely survived the chaos in Berlin. Japan signed its surrender on September 2nd 1945. The Second World War was over, and the world discovered the horrors committed by the Nazi regime. The millions of dead, the final solution decreed by Hitler and his SS. This photo taken in 1946 during a demobilization ceremony is the last image of William Patrick in public. Now an American citizen, he disappeared. The name "Hitler" was a thing of the past. After the War, Adolf Hitler's name was really synonymous with evil, death, war, destruction... You name it that's negative. He was associated with it. So nobody would like to be associated with Adolf Hitler. Where did William Patrick Hitler go? Did he stay in the USA, having taken American citizenship? Did he return to Great Britain or go to Germany, to look for his father? Articles in the postwar British press supply details of his father's life. Arrested in Hamburg in August 1945 by the British Military Police, Alois Hitler was released the same day. He was not a member of the Nazi party. After the war, Alois and his wife changed identity. The Hitlers became the "Hillers". For the British, Alois's case was finally closed after an investigation in 1946, when he was "de-Nazified". His second son, Heinz, had died on the Eastern Front in 1942. Alois spent his latter days in Hamburg, and died there in 1956. He is buried in the vast Holsdorf cemetery, on the outskirts of the city, in a grave still identified as number 209.75, but there is no tomb at this reference address. The concession exists, in his name, but there is no gravestone. A film found in German archives provides a further clue. A film in which Alois's grave appears. Buried here are Alois and his wife, Hedwig. And two other unknowns, Erna and Hans. Research reveals that they too were Hitlers. Hans was a cousin of Alois and Adolf. Erna, his wife, worked in the restaurant in Berlin. Erna had a daughter, called Margot, today deceased. Margot had a son, called Michael, who is still alive. A cousin of William Patrick Hitler. The discovery of his home address was a complete surprise. Michael, Erna's grandson, has been in Israel since the 1970s. He lives with his family in Jerusalem. A Hitler living in Israel is surreal. He and his mother both knew Alois, and above all Hans and Erna Hitler, his grandparents. He must certainly know the history of his family and perhaps have information about his cousin, WPH. A few other children of Nazi dignitaries and Nazis have followed the same path to Israel. The Jewish state was born from the ashes of the Holocaust horrors, and for some, going to live there is a form of repentance. Michael converted to Judaism and became an Israeli national. Over the years, he has become a leading specialist in Hebrew studies at the University of Tel Aviv. This is the marriage contract of Erna and Hans. - Which took place when? - That was in 1942. And the Reichsgesundheitsführer was there, as well as gastwirt Alois Hitler. And... in the second part, the interesting thing is that it gives you the names of the parents of both. You see here Hans Hitler, the son of Johann Hitler, who must be an uncle of Alois. He claims his grandfather, Hans, was a cousin of Alois and Adolf Hitler, which would make him William Patrick's cousin. A cousin he never met. Michael grew up in postwar Germany before seeking exile in Israel. Living in this country is not influenced by any kind of relationship... What can I do if my grandmother married a man with that name? Even if he has put the past behind him, he offers some precious details about his grandparents' lives after the war. He was not killed like other Hitler family members who were killed by Russians when they occupied the part of Austria. He stayed safe after the War and I wasn't interested in a precise relationship. How he came to be... I knew that my grandmother was very proud to be Mrs Hitler. Ok, let that be. They changed name officially to "Hiller" after the War, but everybody knew that "Hiller" was "Hitler". Michael has heard of his cousin, William Patrick, but knows nothing about his life after the war. But back in Germany, another witness perhaps has some information about Alois' elder son. She claims to be Alois' adopted granddaughter, and to have spent her childhood days with him. Packages arrived from America, and they came from William Patrick, granddad's son. They were lots of sweets and brightly coloured clothes. I remember some red shoes. There was also some tinned corned beef, I remember that. But especially candy. Apparently, in the US, they had candies shaped like pebbles. They were very good. Papy never talked about his American son. And so William Patrick stayed in the United States after the war. In New York, his mother, Bridget Hitler, apparently wrote a family biography. The book was deposited at the Manhattan municipal library. An archivist there supplies us with further details. Hello. Here is your book, by Bridget Hitler. My Brother in Law, Adolf. It came as part of the collection of Edmund Pocker, who was a literary agent and Czechoslovakian-born playwright. His papers came to the library in 1959, but it was only later that this typescript was found among his papers. He acquired it from Bridget Hitler. I'm not sure if he actually wrote it. He was a literate agent, so he was trying to get this book and sell it to find a publisher. The book contains plenty of information about WP and Bridget's lives before the war. With documents and photos too. But nothing about the postwar period. Nothing that can help locate them. Did they stay on the East Coast or did they head west, or elsewhere in the vastness of the USA? What is certain, however, is that their lives changed radically, as if their disappearance had been organized. American social security records show that Bridget died on Long Island in 1969. On her card, there is an address. It's a small suburb, like so many others in the USA. Long Island is something of a dormitory for New York City. Wooden houses, in neat rows and lines, proudly sporting American flags. At the address indicated, there is a small house. It was here that Bridget Hitler, William Patrick's mother, lived until she died. The new owners wish to remain anonymous. But they do reveal something of value. In the house next door lived her son, William Patrick. The second surprise is that he raised a family. This house also has a new owner. And the new inhabitants wish to remain anonymous too. And no-one knows what became of the family, but they believe they stayed close to this small Long Island town. Further discussion reveals that the family changed their name to Stuart Houston. A name chosen by WPH to hide behind. It's an odd name, and one that proves to be rather ambiguous. After the war, they changed their name to Stuart Houston, which clearly refers to Houston Stewart Chamberlain, who was a renowned anti-Semite, who had regarded Hitler as the future of Germany. Chamberlain wrote that if there were more men like Hitler, Germany would be saved. So choosing this pseudonym reveals a certain ambivalence, an element of allegiance to National Socialist ideology, and in part, to anti-Semitic ideology. I can't work out how he could imagine that even in America, where not everyone knew about European history, that no one would notice the obvious reference to his uncle that he was making in choosing this name. The Hitler line was therefore continued, and even extended after William Patrick arrived in America. Yet, checking through all directories, there are no traces of any Hitler, or Stuart Houston. No doubt ex-directory then, impossible to find. But if the children grew up here, they must have gone to school. Municipal libraries are often a good source of information. They notably keep school year-books, a sort of precursor to Facebook, published every year by colleges and high schools throughout the US. The highlights in the students lives are featured along with photos. The yearbooks surprisingly reveal that William Patrick Hitler had 4 children: 4 boys, Alexander, Louis, Brian and Howard. The one most photographed is Howard, indicating a lot of friends. He was a member of the school band. One of the easiest of his friends to find is Joseph Silhan, Howard's best friend. But he is the bearer of bad news. Howard died at the age of 32, on September 14th 1989, in a terrible car accident. He had just got married to Marie, a girl from Quebec. Joseph and Howard met in the high school band. Joseph has videos of his friend, with Howard conducting the band. The video was shot at a high school football game. Howard is the young man dressed in white and yellow, dancing in the foreground. He's wearing a white hat. At the end of the game, we can see him laughing with his friends in the stands. He was the life and soul of the group, as this other footage reveals, at a private party. What's with you and this camera? Howard also told him of the terrible secret this apparently ordinary middle-class family was hiding. At the time I knew Willy, I didn't know about his history. That was such a well-guarded secret, even from me. No outsiders knew about that, nobody. That's the way it had to be. Howard, his son, said: "I have something to tell you." We were outside, I remember like it was yesterday. I couldn't believe it. It was just too fantastic to believe... that the man I'd known for these many years was a relative of Adolf Hitler. But the more it settled in, the more things made sense as to why they were so guarded, secretive. I thought it was how the family was, they minded their own business. Thanks to Joseph, we can finally complete the Hitler family tree. After the war, WP married a German girl, Phyllis Jean-Jacques. They had four children. Alexander, Howard, Louis and Brian. They are the last in the Hitler line. The last to bear a name defamed by history. During our interview, Joseph also provided some valuable information about the life of William Patrick. He was great with his kids. I guess he was an older father. He treated me like one of his sons. He loved talking to me. He was very heavily into the zodiac, into astrology. And knowing your sign, and telling you what your fortune may be, what's ahead of you. He was pretty accurate. And his accent... He always reminded me of Michael Caine, the actor. Exact same voice. William Patrick led two lives. One in the spotlight, while his name was an asset, the other in secret. William Patrick worked at home. Phyllis was a telephonist. They lived a life of discretion and isolation. The main idea being to protect their children. But how could they live with such a secret? Was it not too big a burden for them? Especially for the children, as they grew up. The Hitlers' secret weighed heavy on all their children. Of the three surviving brothers, Brian and Louis chose to live together in the family home, staying with their mother until she died in 2004. The two brothers created a gardening business together. Brian and Louis lived a cloistered existence. Paranoia does exist, I'm sure, for at least two of the remaining brothers. They still live together, they are still very guarded, They have a business together and that's all they do. They work and go home. Brian and Louis have reinforced their isolation, building a fence around their house, against any prying eyes. A barrier against any curious visitors. There were no photos of the last Hitlers since high school. But during our preparatory work, we managed to get some unique shots of all three surviving descendants. On this photo, we can see Brian, the youngest, 49 years old. This is Louis, 63, putting away his gardening tools. The third and eldest brother is Alexander, 65. He has chosen to live alone. Alexander also has a terrible secret to conceal. William Patrick and Phyllis's eldest child has a middle name. A name with an ambiguous, despicable significance. His patents baptised him Adolf. Alexander Stuart Houston is also called Adolf Hitler. And yet, of the last three Hitlers, he seems to lead the most normal life, if still discreet. Alex, he was more like Howard. He just found humour in everything, he was very laid back. He was a social worker, for Pete's sake. You can't work with other people and be paranoid yourself. In my opinion, I believe he took the lineage of his history, the Hitler thing and he just put it on the shelf. "It's part of my life. Nothing to do with me. I didn't do any wrong." And that's how he lived his life. Whether or not he had other things to keep from people, I don't know. It would appear that William Patrick Stuart Houston cut all ties with his uncle and his own past. But appearances can be deceptive. Certain indications contradict this notion. The first clue is this book, co-written with his mother, now available at the world's biggest library. The second, the first name of his first son, in homage to the uncle he claimed to hate. The third indication is the ambiguous family name he chose. Why so much mystery? Did he want us to find traces of the Hitler family's past? Did he perhaps hope his own story would not be forgotten? Whenever you start penetrating this family history, you always see some hidden hints, which of course makes it easier for us historians, nowadays, to look at the whole matter. But it doesn't make it easier for us to profile him psychologically, because WPH appears as an individual who was continuously drawn forth and back into different ways of thinking and perceiving the country where he was born in, the country that he decided to go to, Germany, and the country he ended up living in and where he died, the US. We will never get an answer. William Patrick died after a long illness in 1987. His will has remained secret, much like the second part of his life. The only clause we can guess at is his request to be buried on Long Island, next to his mother. So did William Patrick die as "Stuart Houston" or as "Hitler"? There was a great dilemma apparently when WPH died. Because they felt very awkward, very uncomfortable burying him under the name he'd made up. It wasn't his real name. And there was the strong feeling within the family that perhaps this was the time to bury him as WP Hitler. I think, that in the end of the day, they just decided it would negate everything they'd done to keep their lives private. So I think had he successfully left that old life behind, then he would have been William Patrick Stuart Houston. But he didn't really. The fact that we're still talking about it today... He kind of failed, if you like. His children are still living with that name, his wife lived with it till the day she died. So, thinking about it, I think he was buried William Patrick Hitler. Unbelievably, at the death of their father, the four brothers, Alexander, Louis, Howard and Brian, are believed to have taken an oath never to have children. A pact to put an end to the Hitler lineage. A close family friend has confirmed this. A reliable source, whose identity cannot be revealed. To verify this, we'd have to meet the last three surviving Hitlers, but it is impossible to talk to or even see Louis and Brian. They don't want to talk. That leaves Alexander Adolf. By chance, heavy snows the day before meant William Patrick's eldest son was clearing the driveway in front of his house on Long island. With a hidden camera in my glasses, I approached Alexander, and tried to talk to him. Hello. Are you Alexander Stuart Houston? - Yes. Who are you? - My name is Emmanuel. I'm a French film director. Oh yeah. I don't want to talk to you. I know what you're here for and I'm not talking to you. I just wanted to let you know that I'm making a film on your father. Why? Nobody knows anything about my father. But it's nice, I'm glad. You know what? My brothers and I, we don't talk about it to anybody. Ok. It's not important and we don't know anything anyway. I haven't said anything to anybody yet and I don't intend to. You know I read the book your grandma and your father wrote. Why? What good could it do us? Nothing. He wrote a book about it and it was mostly made up. You mean what he writes in it is... We're not going to say anything that's going to change the story. You know, his book is one of the only sources... Yeah, well I would say at least 50% of it is wrong. - Really, that bad? - More than that. That's what writers do, they recoup and they rewrite and they change it the way they want, so have fun. I mean, not you directly, but your family is part of history. Yeah, I know. Unfortunately. Not a good part, either. But like you know, to have once and for all the story... You know, I'd only have to make a call to tell the story. I mean, to avoid people coming, you know, from time to time... I can't stop people coming, but I can not talk to them. Did you make a pact with your brothers, not to have children? My brothers and I have a policy. Don't talk to any kind of film-makers, reporters… Ok. Ok. That's what you're gonna get. Not much. No, that's ok. Why did your father call you Adolf? You do your story, I hope it comes out good. That's it. End of story. Ok, alright. Well... See you. To this day, Alexander, Louis and Brian have no children. And that situation looks likely to continue. They are getting older. We may never know why they would have taken this oath. Perhaps one day they will say. But they grew up with secrets. Secrecy is part of their lives. And yet, there is a certain paradox. Their father grew up as a Hitler, and founded a family, despite the burden of his background. Why do the other Hitlers not grant themselves the right to live like ordinary people? Is it a form of punishment? Are they the victims of their own bloodline? It's difficult to imagine a generation, a family, deciding to put an end to the lineage. It wasn't William Patrick Hitler's choice. He felt quite legitimately that he could have a family, and continue the lineage, regardless of the name. The idea that the next generation almost deliberately decided to refrain from having children... It's possible to imagine, it's a hypothesis that makes you think, because that means they believed there was something rotten in their family's blood. It means that, within themselves, they were convinced by the pre-genetic theories of Adolf Hitler, which goes to show that bad ideas can sometimes live on.
