CONFESSIONS OF A CONGRESSMAN Perhaps I should go to the police before they do. But how do I know that they haven't already done so? Perhaps the police know everything. I have nothing to fear. I am a legal politician... a Democratic Congressman... a representative of the people. And I am important despite being in the opposition. But we've operated in secrecy for so many years. I wonder what my police record is like. "Roberto Orbea, born in Vizcaya in 1938. "Son of Pedro Orbea, a man devoted to the régime. "At 17, he moved to Madrid and entered law school... "where he came into contact with subversive groups... "and joined the Spanish Democratic University Federation - SDUF. "1956, arrested for communist revolt at the university... "starting the incidents with the Political Social Brigade." Where's the meeting? Where? Don't be a fool. Tell us about it. All we want to do is help you. Your respectable father must be very upset. We've also arrested a friend of yours, the Doctor's son. I can't see why you'd get mixed up in a thing like this. Tell us... Who put you in contact with the SDUF? I told you. I know nothing about the SDUF. Oh, come on now! We want to help you, but you're making me lose patience. "In 1962, Roberto Orbea graduated from law school... "and was contacted by the known subversive leader, Professor Pastrana... "ringleader of known militants of the Leftist Party... "and of the Socialist Party. "Their goal is to unite the Leftists with the Socialists." Be reasonable, Orbea. You can't lie to us. We all know about you and that Moreno Pastrana. I have already told you... my relationship with Pastrana is purely academic. Purely academic? He was thrown out of the university years ago. We are very good friends. I also admire him as an intellectual. Do you consider a subversive party something intellectual? I told you I know nothing about that. Sure, I know. Your kind never know anything. They are nonpolitical. It's always a mistake if they are arrested. If we find them with a printing press... they're only printing school notes. Now, why don't you level with me, Orbea? Tell me. But we've also obtained some more information. One of your students has confessed... that you're one of the leaders of a secret organization. Secret... and Marxist! I don't know what he could have said but I assure you... Hold it! Lopez, bring the kid in. "In 1968, Roberto Orbea was fired from the university... "and his teaching post there. "Although the police were sure of his implication... "the proof was not sufficient for indictment. "After teaching, he became a professional lawyer. "With the inheritance received after his fathers death... "he opened a law office with other subversive lawyers. "Their main work was to defend all public offenders. "In 1970, Roberto Orbea defended a terrorist... "and subsequently saved him from the death penalty." My client admits being a terrorist... but this council should know what drove him to it. Counselor, this court is aware of this terrorist's motives. We have more than enough information on that. Your Honor, trying to ignore the social, political... and moral motivations of this man is unjust. On the contrary, this could even turn him into a hero. If you wish to continue his defense... you must respect this military court. How many cases have I defended in my life? But... will I be able to defend myself? Your Honor, trying to ignore the social, political... and moral motivations of this man is unjust. It is necessary to listen to his testimony... all of it! I realized I was a homosexual when I was 15. I was a terrible shock for me... to feel something I had always considered hideous and wrong. At first, I only had a few elusive contacts... in the subway cars... during the matinees at the theater... and in those dirty and smelly... public lavatories. When I was 19, I went to bed with my girlfriend... and discovered that I also liked women. I felt better. I had no real homosexual experience until I was in the service. I couldn't be in the active service because of my record. I was confined to barrack duty in Alcalá de Henares. There I met a boy. We went all the way. It lasted... our whole army life. Then I met Carmen. She was a fellow member in the Party. We fell in love. I hoped that... Carmen would make me forget my homosexuality. And I wouldn't be persecuted all my life. Defending myself before the courts may not be difficult. At least I'm accustomed to that. There they go... to Congress. Willing to elect me Secretary General... of the Party. What will they think of me once the scandal is known? But I'll talk to my friends before that happens. I have the obligation and the right to explain myself. VI CONGRESS SOCIALISM IN FREEDOM BECAUSE SOCIALISM IS FREEDOM Besides, I had already decided to go all the way... to end all this. But where do I begin? How can I tell them? I'll have to tell them that it all began when I was arrested... way back on April 3, 1976. The acting Minister of Internal Affairs, Manuel Fraga Iribarne... decided... that a group of Democratic leaders who were meeting at the Hotel Palace... should be put in jail. It all adds up to five million. - Why aren't you writing? - I'm working on it. So we have decided not to pay the fines. Sure, but don't you favor Fraga that way? Are you kidding? We're about 300 politicians. The Basques, your group, our group... Simón, Ramón, Paco Romero, etc. Who's going to believe that ridiculous Arias Amendment? This may be the last arrest made by the Franco régime. I hope so! We can't take much more. If I were you, I would make a film of all this. It would be much easier to write a novel. Don't you think so? Yes, you're right. What's wrong? Your stomach again? You've got to see a doctor right away. I don't want to be stuck in the infirmary. What the hell! You can't go on like this. Very good. See you tomorrow. How are you today? Fine! Your problem is just a simple case of nerves. Can I go home to my family, then? You're better off staying here. There's good news. The government is giving in. They received many international protests. They'll be free within a week or so. Well, get up. Don't stay in bed. You've got to move around. Whatever you say. Thank you very much. You're welcome. Stay well and have faith. Well, let's see how that boil is doing. Good, it's almost gone. It still hurts. Come on, don't exaggerate! How long? Under arrest? 11 months. Got a long term left? I get out in next month. - What are you in for? - I'm a danger to society. What have you done? Well, they picked me up one night while I was on the make. What do you mean by "on the make?" I go with queers who pay me. And I get good money for it. You're a politician, right? Yes. But how do you know? Because a lot of them roll through here. What's your rap? Dirty politics? No way. I don't deal in such politics. I was here in September when they shot those guys. What a fucking night that was. I'm going to take a piss. I have to go too. I've never liked political prisoners. Why not? They think they are superior. But in here we're all alike. We should all be alike... in here and everywhere else. So you were here the night of the execution. Yes, nobody was able to sleep. It was unbelievable. That morning you could hear their mothers and wives screaming. That was too much. I do my thing anywhere... We received positive information at the meeting yesterday. It seems imminent... Is it true that the King has called various political leaders? No. The only one allowed to see him was Gil Robles. From now on, the King is going to have to change. Who can replace Arias? They're talking about Areizla, but I'm not sure. I don't know. I think it'll be a big surprise. Perhaps some young and unimportant politician... with blue blood and a lot of ambition. Another drink? No, thank you. Besides, it's getting late. Yes, and Roberto and Carmen want to be alone. Not really. We love having you here. But, Carmen, your husband has been in jail for two months. He needs your loving care. Honestly, I don't regret what I have done. I am just... very surprised. I haven't had a homosexual experience since we were married. Not even the desire for it. But in jail... I found that strange environment again. And all of a sudden I recalled... the lavatories when I was a student... the army barracks. My homosexuality was just like that... dirty and persecuted. Something I had to overcome... that is back again. Perhaps stranger than ever. You told me all about it before we got married. If I accepted it then... I must accept it now. I only want you to be sincere with me always. I thought telling Carmen would make it easier for me... but I was wrong. Nes had given me his phone number in jail. I decided... to call him... secretly hoping not to find him. I can get you young kids that'll drive you out of your mind. I told you that this sort of thing... Knock it off! I'll get you some real nice kids. You're in good hands. Don't worry. As long as you pay... and not very much. For 1,000 pesetas you get all you want. But... are there that many on the market? Thousands, and more every day. Being a politician... I can't afford anyone recognizing me. Recognize you? These kids don't care about politics. Why should they recognize you? If you were a singer or a movie star... but you? He was right. Among this kind of people nobody knew who we were. Not only those kids, but everyone in general. I began meeting various boys. Always... in the car... in a hurry... on dark roads and alleys. Always hiding. For once, my clandestinity was an advantage. They didn't make our party legal for nothing, you know. We've had to fight for this situation for a long time. First we'll plead for the Democratic split. Then we'll accept the stipulated split. And finally we'll negotiate with the government opposition. After hearing the Secretary General of the Party, Moreno Pastrana... we will now listen to a member of the Executive Committee, Roberto Orbea. Whether legalized or not... all political forces struggling for democracy and socialism... have always been present in our country. I know that guy. Another son of a bitch! It's just like Portugal after April 25th. They also started with flags and TV speeches that resulted in nothing. All they achieved was getting Lisbon packed with negroes. This guy is in it up to his ears. How come? Because he's been with me and others. He pays pretty good. I'm dead tired. How was the executive meeting? Moreno Pastrana was nominated to run in Santander and I in Madrid. You'll be elected. You can be sure of four votes in Madrid. There's a very good chance that we'll come out on top. Is something bothering you? No. It's nothing. I'm just a bit worried about responsibilities I'll be faced with. You were never afraid of that before. You've known all along that they wanted to elect you Secretary General. What's the matter? Have you had the other problem again? What do you mean? Have you done it again? No, Carmen. Not since jail. It hasn't happened again. Come on. I've prepared a great meal, Mr. Congressman. What about the guy you were going to introduce me to? Which one? The politician. Oh, that one. He's tied up with the elections and stuff. He's a candidate. He's a communist or a socialist or something. Want to earn big money? It's something special. Tomorrow I'll introduce you to a VIP. - Does he pay well? - It's not for that. But he has lots of money and other things. Important, very important things. Above all for kids like yourself. Forced by society to be what you are. We are well aware of you activities, and we've seen your police record. But, none the less, we know you can be useful... in helping to strengthen our country. And money? We'll come to that. With us you'll become a real man... a real Spaniard. But I need money. Don't worry. You'll get enough to stop living as you do now. You'll be protected. We'll even give you guns. And you won't have to run from the police anymore. That's him, right? Look here, Mr. Carres. That's the faggot I was talking about. Nes knows him well. The cops! Don't panic, kid. Come with me and tell me all about Roberts Orbea. Maria del Carmen Madurga Goyanes has voted. Roberto Orbea Salaberri has voted. With that we end our special program. Join us again tonight when we'll update you on the elections. As usual, nothing has been said. Unbelievable! In any other European country, we'd already know the results. In any case, from the information already received... it looks like we've come out on top in Madrid. We'll have to wait until tomorrow to be sure. I'm beat. I'm too old for democracy. I'm going home to rest. Well, that's it. Four congressmen for Madrid... and about 15 more for the rest of Spain. That's not bad after a 21 day campaign... and 40 years of fascism. But you know what worries me? Too much coffee gives me heartburn. That's why I said I was too old. And this happens to many of us. Well, at least we are here and not buried already. Until tomorrow, friends. Good health to all. I love you, Roberto. You're Roberto Orbea, aren't you? Look! The tape that Anna and Victor mentioned. Hey, look at that. There's that queer, Roberto Orbea. Let's hope he hasn't recognized any of our boys. It would ruin our plans. What's going on? We've been attacked. Why didn't you come sooner? Who do you think you are talking to me like that? A congressman. So what? You must have seen what happened. You can't talk to me like that, no matter who you are. You should be ashamed of yourself, taking part in street fights. Nothing would have happened if you had come sooner. The police are fascists! That does it. I'm afraid you'll have to come with me. You can't arrest me. I'm a congressman. Tell that to the judge. If we want democracy, we must do away... with the gangs that threaten our well-being day after day. We still remember crimes like the one in Montejurra. Like the execution of lawyers. The bombing of the newspaper El Papus. All the criminal actions of those gangs... aimed at destroying the legal political groups. Using Spain as an excuse to murder. Murder students... assault journalists, intimidations. That's only a small part of it. And all this is... the action of leftist terrorist groups... whose only goal is to overthrow the present government... and reinstate dictatorship. As a result of Mr. Orbea's speech, a motion was passed... to form a parliamentary committee... that will investigate the activities of the terrorists. Mr. Orbea will be heading the committee. We are going through a very dangerous situation. After the arrests in the Province of Lérida... the police will be harder on us. That's true. The intervention of Orbea and the committee requires direct action. If we go ahead as I have suggested, we have nothing to worry about. I think it's a brilliant idea. We should avoid all violence for a while. The Leftists are discrediting us publicly already. That doesn't help our cause. We'll give them a taste of their own medicine. Hello, Nes. It's been a long time. Sure. Ever since you began avoiding me. Well, let's get into the car. I came here because it's more discreet. The truth is that... I gave it up. What a shame. I was gonna introduce you to a fine kid. Nes, I already told you that... I know you better than you think. He's a real... nice kid. The boy is all right. We've been informed that he's been involved with delinquents all his life. And the kid is a minor. We can get Orbea on charges of corrupting a minor. Can we trust this kid? I've never really liked to make use of scum like him. Do you think it would be easy to find somebody else to do it? No, but we'll find somebody who is willing to beat that faggot to death. Calm down. We're on the right track. This could be very influential to the public opinion. Carres must convince that boy to do it. - A million pesetas? - Exactly. And you don't have to worry. There won't be any complications. We have many friends... on the police force. Really? We can't have you involved in anything illegal. When do I get paid? As soon as we get the evidence we need. Be patient for now. It would be for nothing if he suspects anything. Take it. It's not much, but not bad for a start. What do you want? Nes told me I'd find you here. - Do you mind my coming here? - No, but... I told you I have no time and that it would be difficult. - I'll go then. - No, wait. Since you're here... get in. From then on, my dates with Juanito became regular. He became an absolutely necessary part of my life. When I was with him... all my doubts and fears disappeared. My emotions changed... like a strange frenzy. I'd lose all rational sentiments... as if I were in another dimension. The poems that I had read when I was a teenager... came to my mind again. And far from feeling silly about those childish thoughts... I identified myself with certain verses... while reciting them to myself. "From all the phantoms that inhabit our lives... "you were the truth. "The only truth I was in search of. "More than truth of love, truth of life itself. "You have rid me of all my grief... "my sweet boy." Say, Carmen... where are the keys to the apartment? In the desk drawer. What do you want them for? I want to rent it out. We don't use it anymore. It's a waste to have it empty. You're right. Although I feel kind of bad about renting it. But why? For old time's sake. If only the walls could talk. Sure. I had no idea how much I'd use it when I inherited it. For subversive meetings, as a refuge for political leaders... Don't be nostalgic. It's absurd that it's empty. All the parties now have official offices all over the place. All right. You've convinced me. Who are you going to rent it to? I thought I'd let an agency handle it. Whatever you say. I hasn't been used for a few months. We'll have it cleaned it up in no time. Not bad just for screwing. It's very discreet here. The rest of the building is all offices. I don't really care. I have no opinion at all. We can take the elevator from the garage. Got any music? Sure, listen. What's that? Our National Anthem. Got anything else? I don't know. I have Victor Manuel, Raimón, Ana Belén, Serrat... No rock or flamenco? Better? You'll have to buy new tapes. I'll give you money so you can buy what you like. Is this apartment for love affairs? How many guys have you brought here? This is the first time I've had a guy here. How about broads? Never. Then why so much secrecy and mystery about the apartment? I'll tell you, Juanito. I would like our relationship to last... so I believe it's necessary to be sincere. Do you mistrust me? I trust you. That's why I want to be sincere with you. I want you to know who I really am. You're one of those politicians. Did Nes tell you? He didn't tell me. Who told you? I have seen you on billboards, in newspapers and on TV. I see. Then why didn't you say something sooner? Simply because it is none of my business. You know all about me... but it doesn't bother you. I'd like to know all about you. Everything. I don't even know the color of your eyes. You're too much. Where's the bedroom? What's up? Don't you want to screw tonight? I don't want to keep it from you any longer. It's no longer a simple love affair... with a nameless boy. I suspected it. I knew you had continued it after you got out of jail. But I was confident... that you'd get over it. But I haven't, Carmen. I haven't overcome it. On the contrary. I swear I've attempted to. But the more I think of you and my public image... of my political responsibilities... the more I long to... go to bed with a boy. All the brainwashing I've had for so many years... all the theories I tried to apply... don't mean a thing any more. Perhaps the answer is to give everything up. Resign. I can still be useful. I know I can. Our only mistake was to think that you'd get over it. I thought I could help you get over it, but... Yes, thanks to you... Don't thank me. I'm not trying to be an understanding wife. I'm trying to behave like a Marxist. Do you understand? I'm trying to analyze certain realities. Do you think it doesn't hurt me? That it's easy for me? When you told me before we were married I cried all night. And when I said it didn't matter... it wasn't out of pure love. It was vanity too. Yes, vanity. Because I thought being with me would chance you. You'd need nothing else. So did I. We confided too much in our strength. And we must continue confiding. But not in strength or vanity... not even in theories. What do you suggest? We must only believe in our capacity to love each other. That we need each other. Yes, it's possible. But let me remind you that you are contradicting yourself. If you confide in sentiments, you begin to forget... about the analysis of a certain reality. But sentiments are a certain reality. Although they're difficult to analyze. Although they're impossible to analyze. I love you, Carmen. That's all I can say. Above all and despite everything... I still love you. Two boys to see you. How's it going? Great, according to him. Sure. He's even given me the key to his secret apartment. That makes it even easier. Does he suspect anything? Are you kidding? He's gone completely ape over me. Right on, kid. Will this go on for long? For the moment, we must be patient and not get excited. Well, I'll just have to hang in there. Do you like it? What a rod! Can I hold it for a moment? Hey, be careful! There's no ammo in it. I unloaded it. Let me shoot with it. Some other time. If you do well, we'll give you one like this. I hope so. When's your next date? Tomorrow. We're going to spend the weekend in the mountains. Why do you do this? Why do you go with me for money? Well, because I like money. Although I don't really need it. My dad owns a bar and provides us with everything we need. But I don't like to depend on him. Isn't your father concerned about the life you lead? Are you worried that my dad may come to you and complain? There's no danger of that. No, that's not it. I simply asked because I'd like to know more about you. Does it bother you? I don't dig it, really. Well, in that case... you ask the questions. There's nothing to ask. Nothing? Well... why the hell are you a leftist? First you have to tell me what you think a leftist is. I haven't the slightest idea. But I never thought they were like you. I pictured them differently. How was that? Workers without money. But never a queer like you. We should be getting back to the tent. It's getting cold. "The proletariat dictatorship that contradicts the role... "which Marx assigns to democracy... "is not his invention. "It arises from the most radical and social current... "of the Jacobian principle." Not again. Let me sleep. Despite my affair with the boy, I continued my political activities. Along with Moreno Pastrana, I represented the party at the meeting... that finalized the Moncloa Pact. In congress I became a speaker for the Constitution. The Executive Committee held a meeting... to study and discuss the amendments of the constitutional project. We also discussed the tactics we planned to use in the elections. Another topic was the upcoming Party Convention. The first one to be held legally. They named me spokesman for the press conference. We had to give our opinion of the Moncloa Pact... and our position concerning the Constitution. We are going to present 120 amendments. To achieve this draft, we needed the consensus... of all the different political forces. I have a question, Mr. Orbea. Are you going to replace Pastrana as Secretary General? That's something Congress must decide. But would you accept? Yes, as long as the majority of my comrades agree. Has anything positive been achieved... after our intervention in court two months ago? Due to the Parliamentary committee formed then... some positive results have been achieved. The arrest of various terrorists at the border... the discovery of an arms depot and other police actions... demonstrate that the so-called "uncontrolled groups"... have lost a lot of ground. I'm a correspondent for Argentinian National TV. I have a question. Go ahead. As a lawyer, you have defended many terrorists in court. Isn't it rather contradictory that you are so hostile... towards certain terroristic groups and actions? My party and I are against all terroristic actions. As for my work as defender, I'm quite proud of that. Because we defend the accused against a totalitarian régime. Now we have finally achieved amnesty for them. From now on, no crime can have a political motivation. All terrorism will be a crime against freedom... and peaceful coexistence. Assassinations like that on Aldo Moro and others... would never be carried out by real revolutionaries. What's all this about revolution? It's for a just and free society without prejudice. In other words, a free-for-all. Everyone should have the right to be free and participate. - What's that? - Just a joint. Do you mind? - Want to light it? - No, you do it. I've never smoked one before. It's time you did. I don't feel anything. Swallow that smoke until it burns you lungs. Until it burns... Stop it or you'll fly higher... than a kite. It's finished. I'd roll another one, but we've already had 4. I've had it. Same here. You're hurting me! Stop it, will you? Your balls are heavy. Must be all those books you read. After all this time there's still something we haven't done. We haven't kissed. It's probably because I'm used to kissing my wife. When I'm with boys, I have other things on my mind. I don't really care. I was just surprised. You must have lots of enemies. They're not personal enemies. They're against the ideas I defend. Can't they hurt you? No, I'm used to it. It's 8:00 p.m. We'd better go. Yes, let's go. Hey, Juanito. What's up? Nothing. You don't sound very convincing. You seem to have a problem. Carres and two others were at the apartment. They want to install cameras. But you knew that from the start. There's no backing out now. No, it's not that. I just don't like the whole situation. You'll make a fortune. I know that. Forget about it. Do you want to come to a way-out party? I don't like faggot parties. Don't worry. Only the host is weird, and there'll be broads too. I'm craving to screw a broad. Come on, let's find a bed. Now? Let's wait awhile. Right this moment! Can we use a bedroom? Sure. There's one upstairs to the right. Is he available? It depends on the money. He's a bit strange lately. He's involved with a VIP. Oh, yes? With whom? I bet I know him. How do I know? He's free to do whatever he wants. Do you think I can go and watch them in the bedroom? Go right ahead. Where are you taking the coke? I think you've had enough. This costs money, you know. May I come in? What the fuck... I brought some coke. Great! You might as well have brought a cup of coffee. I'll have some. It's not for sniffing. You've to put it there. There? Where? Where do you think? There. Oh, yes. It feels so damn good. - Now you. - I don't want to. Do it. You'll see how good it feels. Out of sight. You can't complain, Paola. What a rod he's got. Hey, do you want to shove coke up my ass too? If you like... Why don't you just let us screw in peace? Oh, come on. It's his house and his party. You know what? I'm getting out of here. I've had it. You can do what you like. - What about me? - Let him do you. Who? Me? Use coke if it helps. Please stay here. How much do you want? I don't want anything. I'm getting out of here. Do you have a cigarette? It's damn cold. The damn bus is late again. What time do you start work? At 8:00 a.m. Where do you work? At Pegaso. I slave for a travel agency. I'm supposed to be doing real work, but I don't care for that stuff. I thought your family was well-off. It's not true. But you said your father had a bar. My mother is still single. I started going with guys when I was about 13. I was a bellhop in a hotel. Give me a puff. One day I escorted a man in the elevator. This cigarette doesn't draw well. Must be the filter. Once in his room, he grabbed my crotch. He gave me 500 pesetas to jerk me off. I had heard about these guys. Many of the kids at the hotel would hit the streets at night. I came... as soon as he started. I came right away. And that worried me. I wondered whether I was going to be a queer too. But I was only doing it for the money. That was all. Then it became regular. One day they caught me in bed with a guy and fired me. You can imagine what happened after that. I stole cars, pushed grass... a bit of everything. What about your mother? I don't see her very much. She sells cigarettes in a club. Juanito, I'm glad you've been sincere with me at last. It burns me up! Because... why the hell should I tell you everything? Why? Because it's always good to tell the truth. I wonder what they'd think of you if they knew your truth. That you're a queer. My private life is nobody's business. Imagine if they found out that you're paying a guy like me. Don't talk like that. It's the truth. I'm a male prostitute and you know it. And I'm only with you because you pay me. That's all. Listen, Juanito... I don't understand... How the hell can you afford to pay a guy like me anyway? Does your party pay for these services too? I pay for my vices with the money I earn working. I have my own money. Understand? And another thing. Don't talk about the party like that, or else... Fuck your party! I'm sorry. I'm not myself tonight. Are you mad now? I'm trying to find an explanation for all this. But I can't. Let's go to the bedroom. Sure, let's go. Who could that be? I'll go and see. Don't open the door. It's only logical to open the door and see who it is. It's probably someone who's made a mistake. I'll tell them you're not in. But why? I'll just say you're not in. Is Roberto in? No, he's not. May I come in? - Who are you? - His wife. Holy shit! Good evening, Carmen. I knew it was you. And now let me introduce... I was just leaving. Because I have to go. You don't have to leave. Timid, isn't he? Not really. What happened is... you scared him. He's afraid of the truth. Aren't you? Partly, yes. Like you. You could have come in without knocking. You have a key. No. Remember you had rented this apartment out. You never believed it. Of course not. Our old hiding place when our party was still illegal. So many memories. Of printing presses... of illegal meetings... of refugees. Without a doubt a discreet place. It's strange that it ended up being used for this. On the contrary. It's very appropriate. Our party is legal now. I attend meetings at the Moncloa and receptions at the Palace. But I still need this place for certain aspects in my life. I still need the same secrecy. Is this music he likes? You imagined him different, didn't you? I assume you expected a more fragile person... a Visconti character... lying on the beach in Venice listening to music by Mahler. He's not a little Lord acting like Oscar Wilde. Nor a Greek nymph or a "little prince." None of that. He's a whore, a local street loafer. There's no Mahler, no operas and no Venetian beaches. None of all that. Low-class music, noisy discos, overcrowded suburbs... stolen motorbikes and misery. That's his world. Do you love him? Very much. I want you to understand one thing, Roberto. I'm not here to surprise my husband with his lover. Nor to meet him. What for then? I don't want you to lead a double life anymore. I don't want you to continue using a secret apartment. Because, in the long run, I'll get left behind. I don't want that. What do you suggest? I just don't want anything to come between us. I can't live without him... nor without you. He's very young. Yes, he's very young. You've seen him. He could be our son. But he isn't. Don't complicate matters. I'm not complicating anything. The only thing I want is to go ahead. The three of us. And we did. The three of us started going out together. When we met some of our friends... Carmen would introduce him as a relative. Thus avoiding suspicion. Juanito discovered... a different world, unknown to him. His personal interests were aroused by things... he had never cared about... in his life. We are faced with a challenge... a historical challenge. This economic crisis caused by 40 years of fascism... does not help us in developing a truly democratic society. This is, comrades and friends, despite the Pact and new Constitution... the new Constitution we are preparing for a new democracy. There can be no democracy without socialism, and vice versa. But we have a long way to go. A first step would be a leftist victory in the municipal elections. We must make absolutely sure that we take over... the administration. This will enable us to build new schools, parks and cultural centers. Our civil life should be where it belongs. In the hands of the people. I didn't know what to do after I left the meeting. I met a group of friends from my neighborhood who said... "Hey, Juanito. What are you doing here?" I didn't know they were interested in politics. I hadn't seen them in a long time. A lot of kids your age go to the meetings. We walked around awhile with flags and signs... when a van full of cops pulled up. They told us to get rid of the signs. We paid no attention. Only Manolo talked to them. Then we all started to yell, scream and whistle. Will you see them again? Sure, next Sunday. Some youth festival. Well, how about a drink and listening to some music? What's that? Hashish? Yes, it's Afghan. It's not that shit they sell everywhere. It's very dark. I've always seen it lighter. What do you know about it? My brother Tito always smokes these. He's different. Many of our friends smoke them quite often. And many of them are very important people too. What's wrong with it? It all depends. Many people want to legalize it. That would be great. The pushers would be out of business. They charge ten times what it costs them. And they have kids do their dirty work. Doesn't it make you cough? Why should it? Your brother has taught you too much. Here, take it. I forgot the words. Sing another one. No. I can't lift the guitar anymore. Another one? Why are you laughing? She's high. What are we laughing about? Who knows? It's coming on great. Do you like me? I'm not bad, right? Don't you like women? He likes them very much. Maybe I'm too old. But I'm still younger than Roberto. You're so timid... so quiet. Will you accept the truth too? It depends on what you're talking about. I want him to kiss me. Well, ask him. Will you kiss me? Ah, you have to ask his permission. No, that's not it. I'm just bashful. I just want to find out what's so special about you. What brand? I want to talk to you. To me? What about? Are you the mother of Juan Garcia? Yes. Is there anything wrong? Are you the police? No. I belong to a Catholic society that protects minors. How can I help you? We've been informed that your son's having an immoral affair... with a well-known politician. To be specific, with the Marxist Congressman, Roberto Orbea. Did you know that? Of course not. I... Your son... is a minor. Therefore, you have the right... to press charges against the man who is corrupting your son. But Juanito wouldn't stand a chance. He's been arrested before. Here are a few pictures of your son and the congressman. They were taken in public places like shows, meetings, etc. But we know for sure that they go to a private place afterwards. We can give you he address of the place where they meet. Look. If I do that, the boy will have to go to a reformatory. Something terrible could happen to him. Is he in danger? Well, that man is a leftist who is involved with terrorists. You never know what could happen when he mixes with people like that. Well, I've done what I had to by informing you. Good night, Señora. Is Juan in? He's still in bed. I have an urgent message. All right. Come in. It's a message from Roberto Orbea. Wait a minute. I'll tell him. Someone to see you. - Who is it? - He says it's... It's me, Nes. Come on in. What's up? Carres wants to see you this afternoon. What for? He'll tell you himself. I think he wants to install those cameras. Why only now? Who knows? From what I've heard, they're waiting... for Roberto to finish something in Congress tomorrow. I had forgotten all about that. Are you some kind of jerk? What about the money? Perfect... very good. The other Congressmen arrive this afternoon. The committee? They know about it. The phone hasn't stopped ringing. Who? Juanito? Put him on. I am listening. No, I can't. You know I'm very busy with the campaign. Something very urgent? Is anything wrong? Well, the earliest I can meet you is this evening. At the apartment. Good bye. A problem? Just a family matter. Now that you know the truth, you think I'm an asshole. The important thing is that you told me. Many times I wondered about our relationship. But I never suspected his. Of course I was aware that you lied to me... but I knew it couldn't all be false. Which do you consider the biggest lie? Not telling me you were fascist bait. It was telling you that I did this just for the money. I told the same lie to many others too. I tried to convince myself of that ever since the first time. Well, Juanito. This is no time to analyze our behavior. The important thing is that we've all changed. You, me... even Carmen. Between the three of us, we've found a new life. A new dimension. Now we must find a way to face the world. I'm going to call those damn bastards. Don't do it! When will they install the cameras? In two or three days. Well, we must continue to play their game a little longer. What do you mean? We must let them believe that you're going ahead with the plan. You should find out when they intend to install the cameras. But what for? It's the only way to catch them. I'll show up with the police and catch them in the act. Are you afraid? I understand. I'm afraid too. But we must stop being afraid. Once and for all. How can you explain the connection with Roberto Orbea's wife? What's the angle? At times she comes with us. How strange. Does she know about you and her husband? How could she? I have no doubt that you'd go to bed with both of them. They're capable of anything. Although I wouldn't mind. What a piece. And the meeting. Why the hell did you go to the meeting? Out of curiosity. Sure, that's what we thought. When do you intend to install the cameras? We don't need special cameras to take these pictures. I mean the bedroom shots. What for? To see two faggots making out? Wasn't that planned? We don't like pornography. Do you think we're some sort of shit-ass magazine or what? But Nes told me... We know what he said, but we've changed our plan. You liked this gun, didn't you? I still do. Go on, take it. You're nervous, huh? With a gun in your hand, you should take it real easy. Especially if you have to use it. Would you be able to kill someone with that gun? I think so. It all depends who it'd be. For example, could you kill Roberto Orbea? I'll load it for you. You son of a bitch! Do you think you can play games with us? Well, you can't. We don't need those pictures any longer. Our plans have changed. We'll tell you about it. We'll explain it to you in full detail. It's past 10:30. He should've been here over an hour ago. I don't know, Roberto. Perhaps you shouldn't have confided in him. Maybe he's changed his mind and is back with them again. No, I'm sure he didn't... Wait, I'll get it. Where's Juanito? At the apartment. Waiting... with them. With whom? They said they'd do him in if you called the police. What do they want? If you want to save him... you'd better be there in less than two hours. If you call anyone or do anything drastic, they'll kill him. They mean business. I don't know what they want from me, but I'll go anyway. You'd better. They are really serious. This wouldn't have happened if I hadn't met you. Why, Nes? Why? Well... you bought me, didn't you? So did they. I have to go. Good bye. You heard? Don't go. I have no choice. It's a trap. But I have to save him. Please don't dramatize. I know you love him. Do you think I'd have gone through all this otherwise? I tried to share my love... with both of you. But don't expect everyone to react like me. The party and the people... will turn against you once they know. Tomorrow they'll elect you Secretary General. Do you know that's impossible for a homosexual? It's not only your prestige. It's the prestige of the whole party. I've told you that it'd be better to resign. And that I thought I could still be useful. I wasn't wrong. But you may be right. If I'm being used by both extremes... I can at least have the satisfaction of sticking it out until the end. Living up to my contradictions. As you know... I always wanted to make history... and now I'm going to be a victim of it. I had a lot of bad luck. Listen, Roberto. What I meant to say was... I know what you meant, Carmen. It's very simple. In a few years, the people will say... "Oh, yes. Roberto Orbea. "That faggot who wanted to be a politician. "What a jerk. "An irresponsible ass." You'll leave... sick and tired of this mess. Having sacrificed the best years of your life for nothing... or practically nothing. To have received... nothing but the love and appreciation of a failure. Juanito will also leave... hoping to find someone younger. Or some woman he can fool and be happy with. Oh, and be normal! That's what it's all about. And I might end up... being one of those dirty old men who hang around public lavatories. Who write on bathroom doors... and sit in the last row of certain theaters. Who spend every afternoon in the pool halls... or watch the school kids go by. Of course, I can always go back to my theories. An analysis of the concreteness of the concrete reality. And who knows? I might discover that it's the best way to make history. Suffering. Let the others have the power. Those who don't mind giving in... and covering up to get ahead. But not me. I'm tired of giving in and covering up. Don't touch the switch and close the door. Where is he? In the bedroom. Go in. I'm sure you're anxious to see him. Surprised? Why did you do this? I came here... before the time was up. Are you going to kill me too? It's much more fun to see how a leftist leader... explains a dead body in his apartment. In his secret apartment. I wish you luck in Congress tomorrow. They'll elect you Secretary General. Isn't that right? How nice for you. I stayed with the body all night long... trying to be reasonable and not despair. I called Carmen and told her what had happened... asking her to wait there until I had made a decision. What decision can I make? For the moment, tell all my friends. Tell them the truth. The whole truth.
