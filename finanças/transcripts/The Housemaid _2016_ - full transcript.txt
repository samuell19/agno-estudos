Subtitles by explosiveskull I'm Officer Guy Baron. This is Officer Bao. Do we need a interpreter? I can understand you. We know you discovered the captain's body and you're shaken up. We need your help. Can you answer some questions? How long have you been in Sa-Cat? Sebastien! Who are you? Why are you here? Get out of my home! Get out! I'm sorry. Were you here last night? Yes, captain. I just saw flashes of what happened. Thought I saw your face. Mrs. Ngo is the one you should thank. You speak well. Not really. How did you learn? My aunt was a school teacher. She taught me and my brother. It's nice to have someone else in the house who understands me. We need to clean your wound.. ...from the infection. I need to bathe you. How long have you been here? Just a couple of weeks, captain. Do you like it so far? Yes, captain. Pass me my scotch. I'm sorry. Those damn revolutionaries. Got me in an ambush on my way home. I'm glad you survived it. I have feeling that Giap will want to confront us should we go into Dien Vien Phu. And they will be prepared. How do you know this? They almost got me on my way home. I just think we shouldn't get too confident. Tides of war are turning against us. What do you mean, Laurent? I mean they've become wise to us. We didn't think that a small group of rubber workers were going to make much of a difference in 30's. And it resulted in a revolution that forced us plantation owners to make concessions. Let's not underestimate them. I've been watching you. I see you looking at me too, right? No, I don't. No, I don't. I know you want a big French man like me, yeah? - Come on. - No, no, please. Leave me alone. No! - You will like it. - No! Please! No! Please. Leave me alone. No! You.. You think you can hurt me? No! You deserve it, you god.. No! Get off of her. Sebastien, wait, wait! - Wait! - Get the hell out of my house. Are you okay? You have the whole week off. I know. I'm looking for my schedule. I'll get it for you. - Oh. - I'm sorry. No. Don't worry. It's just old files. Who are these people? All the workers. Every single one of them. From the very beginning of the plantation. Your schedule. Happy day to you too. What's wrong? Holidays are difficult for me sometimes. Me too. It's me. It's just me. Good morning. How did I get here? I put you there. I slept on the couch. But, captain.. You don't need to call me captain. You can call me Sebastien. I'm going out for a drive. Would you care to join me? Get in. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Keep going. Keep going. I'm breaking your car. - It's okay. - I'm sorry. Ong Chau will fix it. - Let me. - Okay. How's your family, Aunt Ngo? Good. Did you see your children? I didn't know that. After all these years. Yes. There is. Sit and eat with me. Sit. I invite you to eat with me. Please eat. Have her take them up to the bedroom. Why didn't you write to me to let me know you were coming? I wanted to surprise you. But what if I weren't here? You would have traveled all this way for nothing. I wouldn't say for nothing. I'd have just stayed here until you returned. Besides, I've missed it here. Madeleine, I distinctly remember you calling Vietnam wretched. You ran back to France as quickly as possible after your family sold their plantation. It's no secret I was homesick. I missed Paris as much as I missed you, my darling. Didn't you miss me? Of course. You could have given me some notice. Can't I come and see my fiancé whenever I please? So, you're Sebastien's maid? Yes, mademoiselle. Has he been faithful? Sorry? Has Sebastien been faithful to me? I wouldn't know, mademoiselle. Yes, you would. You're here the whole time. I don't know. I don't think he'd cheat on me. I can't imagine him falling for a crude local. I guess you'll do. Pardon me? You are to be my chambermaid when I live here. I don't understand. Well, Sebastien is obviously not coming back to Paris with my family fortune dwindling I'm gonna have to live in this horrible place. But I thought that the Laurent family was the one... You were eavesdropping. It's okay. You were in the same room. Besides, we're gonna have to get to know each other if you are gonna be my servant. A woman needs to do things to secure her future sometimes. Take my advice. You'll need to learn that to survive. Thank you. Do you have marmalade? She couldn't find any at the market. And she has no time to make it, mademoiselle. Well, I suppose the service here isn't as good as it is in Paris. Thank you, Mrs. Ngo. Perhaps this afternoon, you can show me the new rose garden. Sure. What are you doing in here? I was just cleaning. Why are you crying? I'm not crying. Mademoiselle. I'm missing my bracelet. What have you done with it? I haven't seen your brace... It was here on the night stand and now it's disappeared. I'm sorry but... I distinctly remember seeing it there before we went down to breakfast. I'm sorry but I do not know where your bracelet is. Sebastien, you're not listening to me. But it doesn't mean that she stole it. I've seen this before. My maid was stealing from us for years and by the time we found out it was too late, she'd sold everything. You are jumping to conclusions. She's the only one that could've been in my room. I know it was her. Mademoiselle. - Please, mademoiselle. - What are you doing? I know she has it. Madeleine, stop! Now do you believe me? But I didn't take it. These servants steal from us all the time. You need to punish her. Make an example of her. Whip her. I can't whip her. Then she needs to leave this house. I'm not staying in our future home with a thief. - Madeleine, let's just.. - We have proof. She needs to leave. You won't regret that, Sebastien. I have to do it with our servants all the time. It's not a nice thing to do but it's a necessary burden. And it's my favorite bracelet. Look. You said that you put your bracelets on the night stand before you went to breakfast. That's right. Then how were you wearing it this morning? What do you mean? I remember you wearing the bracelet at breakfast. I specifically took note of it. How was it supposedly taken from your night stand when you already had it? What are you saying... You planted that bracelet in Linh's room. - Didn't you? - Of course I didn't. Why would you do such a thing? Because I know. What do you know? Don't try to deny it. How could you? With a lowly housemaid? - I'm not ashamed. - You're not ashamed? You're cheating on your fiancé with a primitive, common whore and you're not ashamed! She's not a whore! You love her, don't you? Sebastien, you're sick. You're becoming one of them. - I won't stand for this.. - No, this is.. This is proof why you need to leave here. I'm not leaving. You are. I mean it. Leave. Now! Just you wait till I tell your family about this. That you've risked their good family name on a common harlot. Yeah. Go tell them. Go tell all of Paris. See if I care. Linh. Linh, listen.. How could you believe her? I told her to leave. She's gone. I'm sorry. Hit me. Hit me again. Harder. Harder. Harder! I want you to hurt me. What was that? Oh, God! Oh, no. Hello? Hello? Oh, God! Hello? Oh, God! I, uh.. I couldn't see you there. What are you doing? Oh, God. You don't need to be upset, Mrs. Han. Linh has only been here for a few months. She doesn't know. Nobody knows Sa-Cat like you do. But I think it'd be best to have... a new vision for the house. No, thank you, captain. Please, take it. Mrs. Han.. ...Linh has displayed the hard work and dedication I want for the future of the Sa-Cat. Do you have a problem with taking her instruction? I do, Captain Laurent. Then perhaps it might be best to return to your home to take care of your mother. She needs you more than Sa-Cat does right now. Can I take you to the train station? No, thanks. I can go by myself. The war has escalated and the French army is worried about losing the Gulf of Tonkin. I have to return to battle. Now? Tomorrow. I've recovered from my injuries. I must return to my post. You mustn't go back. You'll be killed. They're ordering me back. I have to fulfill my duty. I'm leaving in the morning. Where did you bury them? Betrayer! I promise I'll return. This has happened before. You leaving someone here in Sa-Cat while you were away at war. It's like.. ...history is repeating itself. I'll come back to you. You are mine! You are mine! No! Stop haunting me! You are mine! Stop haunting me! Stop! Stop haunting me! But why would the ghost of his dead wife want to kill him? We don't have enough to keep you here so we're letting you go. Forgive me. No. No! Subtitles by explosiveskull
