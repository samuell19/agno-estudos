Open the door Open the other side Harder! What’ve they done! Stop! I’ll open it. Do it Just 6.5 A film by Saeed Roustaee - I divorced my wife and married her again. - What was the problem? I don’t know... You don’t know why you divorced your wife? I didn’t do it. She asked for it. - What for? - My job. What did she want you to do? Take a desk job. I’ve put your name on the promotion list Should I cross it off? No. I love my job! Your wife divorced you over your job and... ...you remarried her to get promoted in that same job?! Would you have done it if being married wasn’t a requirement for the promotion? What a thing to say boss! My child was suffering from the divorce. - So your wife is okay with your job now? - Not if I get promoted You think it’ll make a difference? It did for you. They gave you a council house. So her problem is your house? She was afraid what happened with Hamid’s child, would happen to ours What if Hamid gets the promotion? Then I’ll divorce her again and be free Why do you want me to fill out the report? Because you found the dope. You were in charge, why do I need to write it? - Was I in charge of the mission? - Yes Then I’m ordering you to write it. We got the dope but not its owner so I need to go to court to explain?! My wife’s been back for two days I woke up with the buzzer today with a subpoena at the door! If my wife had woken up before me my life would be up in the air now She thinks all this stuff is over now! Subpoena for what? Remember the dealer we picked up six months ago with 50 grams? Yes. We brought him in but lost the 50 grams I’ve been to court 30 times If this gets added to that the judge will throw me straight in prison Why didn’t you tell me you were picking up Parviz Abbasi? Because the guy is only Nasser Khakzad’s inferior. - Parviz Abbasi killed the kid! - Nasser Khakzad ordered him to do it! The guy killed my child! He had the child kidnapped He killed him! I interrogated him myself They were trying to escape and crashed. How do you know it all leads to Nasser Khakzad? You said he was in Nasser Khakzad’s gang! Who’s ever taken responsibility for his dope? Nobody And Nasser Khakzad’s name is in now Everyone says their dope belongs to him Just ask who he is, what he looks like and none of them knows a thing! I don’t care what you say I’ll find a way to take my revenge Any news boss? About? Nasser Khakzad? No Any trace? Nothing - The phone company? - Samad tell him There's no Nasser Khakzad in the drug trade. I told you how smart he was Don’t turn him into such a mastermind We won’t be able to find him until we believe he’s smart. He’s not smart, he’s just lucky So why haven’t we caught him yet? Not everyone with a drugstore connection who... ...buys antihistamines to make crack is smart! I don't think he's smart If he wasn't smart we'd have found him by now Reza Shate was smart, it took us ten years to arrest him I’m sure out of every four dealers you arrest one will know this bastard. This round will be different from the rest We’ll go after every user and homeless person we know Through them we’ll pick up the petty dealers With their confessions we’ll get to the major dealers Am I disturbing you?

He took his motorcycle. Come in sweetheart. Come sit here. Don’t be scared. Don’t cry honey! Samad? Yes. - There’s nothing. - Nothing here either. It's impossible, he gets 60 calls per day. What are you looking for? - It’s just a tiny house. - We’ve looked everywhere. Did you search everything? Take a look for yourself. I even looked inside the TV, there’s nothing Don’t cry honey I'll file a complaint against them What do you wanna do? Have them file a complaint? I would’ve found it if he’d hid anything. It’s non-alcoholic beer, for kidney stones! Clear up, let’s go. - Go where? - Did you find anything? Let’s go. There’s nothing here. Okay. And he’s not here. - So? - He’s gone to get some! Maybe he’ll have some dope on him He won’t come! What dope?! We won’t file a complaint! Please go! We haven’t done anything! Morteza? Yes sir? Call if you see a motorcycle. Yes sir. A Honda turned into the alley. - Is he alone? - Yes. - Don’t let him see you. - Yes sir. - Is he coming toward us? - I think so Yes - Is he carrying anything? - Some bread and a plastic bag.

Call someone to pick up your kids. - My wife will take them. - Your wife’s a accomplice, she'll stay. - Call a relative. - We don’t have any relatives here. - Why is this on my desk? - Sorry, I forgot. Charge him an extra week so he doesn’t forget. Call Welfare and have someone pick up his kids. Why Welfare?! If you don’t answer every question, you and your wife will go straight to prison and your kids will end up in welfare. If you separate them they’ll die of grief. You think I’ll let your wife go just for the sake of your kids?! What’ll the judge read? A report. Who writes the report? Me. What did I write? Here it is I wrote you own the drugs and your wife is a carrier We know what’ll happen to you and your wife’s gonna get a few years What’ll happen to your kids in this time? What should I do? If you take me straight to his Lab I’ll tear up the report and send your family home. But only if I won't come back empty handed. Do you think your kids will have a good time in the welfare system? I don’t know if he cooks it himself. Himself! Who is this person? I want a name! What are you afraid of bastard?! If we get him here he won’t be able to do anything! Just give me a name! Nasser. - Nasser who? - Khakzad. You get it direct from him. I called him directly in the beginning, but he wouldn’t bring the stuff He’d have the big guy deliver. Will you know him if you see him? No. - So how do you know him? - Through his dealer. What middleman? Explain! His name’s Hassan Daliri they call him Hassan the cow. Fine Call the cow and have him deliver some dope. He’ll get suspicious if I call now I just bought a batch. - Fine, we’ll call tomorrow. - They’re going away tomorrow That’s why I bought so much I usually don’t buy this much. - Where are they going? - Japan. - Is he going too? - Who? Who’re we talking about? Nasser Khakzad! I doubt it. Why Japan? It’s the right place now. The profits are greater It’s about 300 million per kilo. What time’s he leaving? In the morning. What’s wrong? It’s nothing. Exhale. Let’s go. - Is something wrong? - Come here a second. - Why? - It’ll take a few moments One, two, three, four. Sergeant? How’s he? He’s too fat. I don’t think it’ll show. How about him? He’s good. My flight’s about to leave! You stuffed it in them so it wouldn’t show? What're you talking about? Let me see your legs. Got something there too? Why did you tighten your muscles? I haven’t tightened anything. Don’t worry, I won’t do anything. I wanna see if it’s still in your stomach, or down in your intestines. For the love of God, let it go. Should I push it up and have you puke or push it down and have you shit? Neither Be a gentleman and let me catch my flight. Your stinking breath isn’t because of what you’ve swallowed? I’m always like this, like there's a dead dog in my stomach! Go through the x-ray, if you're empty I’ll let you all go. What’s this about? Maybe we’ve made a mistake. Go ahead. What if I refuse? What? Get up. Stand straight, look ahead, don’t move. It’s all drugs. Some of it is in his stomach, and some in his intestines. What’s that? Platinum rod in his leg. Come out. Come in. Which one is it? Him. Which one? Show me! That one. Go and point. Point and say his name out loud. Hassan Daliri. Hassan Daliri, Hassan Daliri, the guy you buy... Drugs. ...buy drugs from. Get out. - So you don’t know where he cooks? - No one knows. - You don’t know where he lives? - I swear on my kids' lives How did you buy from him? We’d meet a different place each time, the car, a motel.... - You said the drugs on you belong to him? - Yes. If we don’t find him, it’ll belong to you. When all four of us say it’s his?! It doesn’t make a difference as long as we don’t know who he is. He’s wasting time so Nasser Khakzad will find out and escape. Hassan the cow! I’ll treat you exactly the same way you treat me. What do they call three fatsos next to each other? What? A gang. What do they call bringing together three fatsoes? Making a gang. What’s the sentence for making a gang? Execution! They’re my neighborhood buddies! What gang?! Who put together this gang? You! Who decides you made this gang? Me! How did I decide? All three say you’re in charge, signed and fingerprinted. What did you sign?! One: I can say you are neighborhood buddies and you’ll all receive the same sentence. Two: I can write you're a gang, make you the leader and add their sentence on yours. - Which one? - Why? - Gang or neighborhood buddies? - I swear I don’t even know what a gang is! So it’s number two. It’ll be a gang and you’ll get their sentence added to yours. - Maybe I know someone who knows something. - “Maybe” won’t do any good. - She was Nasser’s fiancé. - How do you know Nasser’s fiancé? She’s my niece. - Your niece was Nasser’s fiancé? - She might know where he is. Why do you think I’m lying? I don’t think you’re lying. I’m sure you are. Get out. Get out. All of you. Hurry. Hurry. You too. - I’ll be done in a minute. - Take him outside. It’ll be done in a minute. Hamid! Get out now. Sergeant! Why’re you still here? Get out. I said hurry up! You too ma’am. You stay. I’ll call you. Stay by the door. Yes? - What? - Can I make a copy? No need. I'll be quick! Fuck copying! Get out! The door! Stop repeating yourself. Where is he now? I haven’t seen him in more than a year. Did you marry Nasser Khakzad? - It didn’t work out. - Why? We had differences - Difference of opinion? - No. Class difference. - You were wealthier than him? - Not necessarily financially. Behavior-wise? No, he was quite nice tempered. The issue wasn’t his behavior, it was his character. I don’t understand, Explain it to me. I’m engaged to be married soon. I don’t know why I’m here and why I have to answer your questions?! If you change the subject you'll go to jail a week... ...and I'll ask the next question afterwards. Explain, what do you mean the issue was his character? He tried to act respectable, but couldn’t. He tried hard, but it didn’t work. He couldn’t help it. It was clear he was pretending. He wanted to speak politely, but was more comfortable cursing. He was more comfortable being a hooligan. I tried to help him become what he wanted, but I couldn’t. Is that why you left him? It wasn’t just that. Then what? Was he a druggie? An alcoholic? No. But... he couldn’t sleep, if not taking a pill. He was always very stressful. Almost every night... Every night? He behaved strangely... Every night? He slept with his shoes on. Did you ask why? He said he was more comfortable And you didn’t know he was a crack dealer and your uncle his carrier? Yes. Yes means you didn’t know? Yes. Are you confirming what I said? Yes. You mean to say you didn’t know? Yes. Louder, I can’t hear you. Yes. Very well. If you’re done playing games we can get to the main subject. Your car is worth 800 million, right? I don’t know. You should ask my dad. I doubt he'd know He bought it for me. His entire assets are less than 500 million. How could he pay 800 million for your car? - What’s that got to do with anything? - What’s it got to do? I don’t want to connect your car to Nasser Khakzad, ...make you a accomplice and send you to prison. I just want an address, That’s all. Not the restaurants where you had dinner, I want his home address. The place where without being married, you saw him sleep with his shoes on. How can I make you believe I don’t know? You can’t! I won’t believe it. Tell me the truth and I’ll believe it. If I confiscate your car will you get into class issues with your friends?! I didn’t mean it like that. Does the groom know the bride’s car was bought by Nasser Khakzad? You don’t know that. Un-decided. That’s what they call people like you in prison. If your file goes in here... ...you’ll go to prison until Nasser Khakzad is arrested. What’re you gonna tell the groom if I sign your arrest papers? For what crime? The fact that Hassan the cow is your uncle is a crime by itself. I barely ever see him! I don’t care if you’re soon to be married. I’ll make you forget you were ever gonna be a bride. Do you want him to leave you when you’re in jail? Why are you mixing everything together? I’m not mixing anything together. It’s all related. Nasser Khakzad to you, you to your uncle, your... ...uncle to Nasser Khakzad, Nasser Khakzad to crack, crack to your car, you to your soon-to-be-husband, your soon-to-be-husband to me, ...and I am dying to get my hands on Nasser Khakzad. Just see what I can do to you that I won’t. What’ll happen if you find him? You’ll go home and he won’t find out... I mean about Nasser? He’ll go through the legal procedure. I don’t know if he’s still there. Not revealing the address is a crime too. Would you rather give the address and go home, or should I send you to jail? How will it end? What’ll you do to him? I won’t do anything. I’ll hand him to the court. Will he be executed? Ashkani! Ashkani, come here. Send her to jail if she doesn't give the address - Hello. - Can I help you? Police. We have a search warrant. - What do you need? - The keys to the penthouse. What for? Mammad, lobby, Pirouz, parking, the rest of you follow me. No one leaves the building. Guys, no one leaves the building. One person at the door and one at the parking entrance. Cuff him and come in. Uncle, why won’t mom let me call you? Your uncle’s busy, you can’t keep calling him. Can you tell mom to change my gymnastics class? Ever since you told him your friend has a gym he wants to go there. Will you make arrangements so I can take him? Arsalan changed his class and learned the cart wheel, but I haven’t learned yet. Give me the phone a second. Brother, do something. He’s driving her mad with his nagging. Call me when you get home. I want to ask about Vahid's car - I found his stash Nasser Khakzad. Call an ambulance. Bring Hassan the cow for identification. - Why so low? - It’s where you belong. - Cuff me somewhere else. - Stop talking. - Don’t you know what I do to rats? - Why’re you telling me? They told you to send me a message. Why didn’t you give me a hint? It was our fate to get caught. What do you wanna do now? Your fate is to take responsibility so I can get out... ...and if it’s your fate I’ll get you out. Take responsibility? You or one of these guys will take responsibility. You can’t talk like that in here. I’ll be out of here before morning. Who's gonna get you out without me? I saw you ruin so many people, but I was dumb enough to keep working for you. How dare you talk to me like that when I’ve been paying you for the past four years! Even if I take responsibility for the stuff on me, what're you gonna do about the dope in your house? Deal with these and I’ll take care of the rest. I’ll handle the guards. You’re gonna be executed for sure. At least tell them we’re innocent Is that all you have to tell me? Aren’t you tired of all the shit you’ve done? At least save four petty dealers so you’ll have a good deed for the other world. Hassan the cow... any prison, any cell, anywhere they send you I’ll have you shanked in the toilet. I’ll do something you’ll wish you were dead. What about us? - You’re worst than him. - Watch your mouth. Shut up tanker! - You’ll take responsibility for mine? - Did I ask you to take the stuff? He brought us over, but you gave us the dope. - Go file a complaint if you’ve got proof. - What’s the stuff in our stomachs then? I dare you to say you got it from me! Get up. Get up. Leave him. Leave that one. I wanna talk to him. Get up. Who told you to sit down? - I can’t, it’s too low. - You can. Get up! Get up! Straighten your knees! Straighten them! I told you to stand up! Knees straight, feet together! Get up. Card. What? Give me your bankcard and name your amount... ...just make sure they don’t take me to the drug agency. Are you trying to buy me? Do you know how long I’ve been searching for you? How long? One year? I’ll pay ten years of your salary. Have you ever been kneed in the face? Name your price. You think I’m a child?! - Is 500 million enough? - I don’t want you to go bankrupt. A billion? Your minimum sentence will be execution. Two billion. - Will you pay me yourself? - You want the money and you’ll get it. I’m not alone. - Two billion’s only good for one person. - Two billion for one person?! You know better. It takes money to do anything in life. Don’t worry about the others. I’ll deal with them. When will you do it? I need to make a phone call and it’ll be in your account. How much? Whatever it takes for me to go straight home Add another billion If that’s your final offer Final offer... then add another billion I’ll deposit four billion into your account Don’t you wanna get out? I do. If you did you wouldn’t have asked for my card number. If a deposit will get you in trouble, I can get you cash. Traveler checks, dollars, whatever. No. What’s your problem? I didn’t like it when you said “if it’s your final offer”. - Wait, we can make a deal. - Maybe we’ll make a deal. Who said you could sit? Get up. Don't you dare sit again!! I won't repeat it again Drive. Massoud Shahi, come over here. Saeed Farahani, Come here! Doctor, leave him. Examine this one instead. Get going. Move it! - Open your mouth. - What do they do here doc? Open up. They fingerprint you and keep you in a cell till the morning. He’s fine. Musa Ramak, Jafar Ramak, Jahangir Ramak, Jahanbaksh Ramak. Stop reading the list. Let’s go. Fingerprinting for what? I’m not coming! - I’ll cut you into pieces! - You won’t dare! Who said you could talk to me like that?! You have to control yourself. - I’m not coming! - It’s not an invitation! - You’re making up a case against me! - Shut up! There won’t be a case until we go to court. So why do you need to fingerprint me? Samad! He’s bruising his fingertips! - I’m not going! - Get in! Come here! - Stand here. - I’m 172 centimeters. I didn’t ask your height! Stand here! Look in the camera. The camera! - We talked. - So what? You can’t do this stuff until my lawyer gets here. You’re making up a case against me. Stop making a fuss. Do your job. Why do you let him talk?! Name? Nasser. Last name? Khakzad. Not tonight. Father’s name? Are you asking or is mom? Davood. Just say yes or no. Did your mom ask you to call? National ID number? I don’t remember. Home address? Where they picked me up. It’s in the report. Done. Take him away. Was that so hard? Take a look. His name isn’t Nasser Khakzad. These fingerprints belong to Ali Rostami, his father’s name is Ramezan. He was arrested two years ago with nine kilos of crack. He was to be executed but.... Are you sure it’s him? Yes. His birth certificate’s been voided. Do you want to take his fingerprints again? - Is this the one you just took? - Yes. With his address and father’s name. Everything matches. Are you sure? It’s him sir. It’s him. - Get a print out of his record. - Yes sir. - Get up! - Yo! What’s up?! Your time's up. He wants to sit It's just a holding cell, no need for prison action. His brain is tied to a fuse, if he repeats himself twice he’ll get all mad, the fuse will light up, his brain will catch on fire he’ll beat you up and you’ll spend the rest of your life in a wheelchair. Hurry up! Did you recognize me? Or have you forgotten like your brother? What do you think you’re doing? I’ll respect you for a maximum of two minutes. Just so you know. You have no respect. You just know who you’re dealing with. If you were a stranger you wouldn’t talk like that. Who do you think you are, talking to me like that? You’re from the old neighborhood, so I won’t say anything. Hurry up and go in. No lying down. Sit straight. No lying down. Sit straight. I’m talking to you. I had your back as soon as you walked in, but you embarrassed me in front of everyone. What old neighborhood?! Zamzam. You barely show up once a year, but your brother comes around every week with a high-end car, swings around the poor folks. How do you know Vahid? We were classmates. You used to bring stuff for my brother back then. Crack was popular. Let’s go sit in that corner. - What’s wrong with right here? - It’s in the center and you have enemies. You may get shanked in a place, you’ll be too embarrassed to get stitched. - Who’s your brother? - Jafar. South of Jalili Square in Bank alley. You’d bring him crack with your red bike. The last time you brought him stuff he got caught. Get up. Go sit over there. Move over a bit. When did you turn into a rat? What rat? I’ve been arrested. - For what? - One gram of opium. - You don’t look like a user. - I’m not. It’s what I do. I hand myself in with a gram of opium. Spend the night and get out in the morning. - What do you sell? - Mobile phones, cigarettes... Mobile phones? Yes. Any time you want, but cigarettes after midnight. What about pills? Got any? Only opium and heroin. - Can you get me pills? - If you’ve got money. Make a phone call for me. Not here. There’s a camera. - You’ve got to go by the toilet. - Let’s go. Hurry up! Get out! What’re you doing here? He’s my kid. Need anything? I’m dying from withdrawal already. Just imagine how I’ll be in prison. - Dial a number for me. - You have to ask them to pay for the call. - How much? - 500,000 per call. I’ll text my card number to the number you call. Fine Hurry up and come out old man or I’ll tell them you’re vaping off toilet gasses! Would you like me to embarrass you like that? Shut up! Go in and pretend you’re taking a shit. Where do you keep it? It stinks worse than in here! Where do you think I stuff it to get it in? Vahid hi. Hi bro, how are you? Fine. Listen to me. Did you call Japanese Reza? Yes a few times. - What did he say? - He’ll be right out. - Let me know what you find out - Okay Ask him who it was that took all that money to wipe my file clean. Okay. They took my fingerprints and all my records showed up. It’s occupied. Do you know a guy called... Mohammad Ali Mohammadi. ...Mohammad Ali Mohammadi? Who is it? He says he was your classmate. Oh yeah! I’ll send you a card number Deposit a few million, I’ll need it. Okay. Tell him to do whatever he can before the court date. I want out before I get on the bus It’ll be cheaper here. Make sure he follows through. Okay Bye Oh God! - Will it work? - Why not? - I’m afraid - There’s nothing to be afraid of Just tell them my dad didn’t know I sold drugs. Look at this asshole. You’re teaching your kid to take the blame for your dope? I have a record. What’s it got to do with the kid? If it gets pinned on me I’ll have to spend three years in prison. I’ve only been out for a couple of months! How will he turn out if he goes in at this age? Don’t make me laugh. He’s small. If he goes in, they’ll make him stuff it. Mind your own business. Get out. Me? I said get your ass out there! You better pray I don’t come back. Get out. - Where are you taking me? - Hush! Move. Tell me where you’re taking me. - Did Parviz Abbasi work for you? - Hamid! Who’s he? You don’t know him? Does he know me? - Did he say he’s a customer too? - Just wait and you’ll see. You ordered him to kidnapped the child He won’t take responsibility Stop wasting your breath. What child? The innocent child you handed to them and they crashed! My child! Stop it Hamid Open the door Come out. Stick out your head. Is that him? Is there anyone who doesn’t know this bastard? - Name! - Nasser Khakzad. You and Japanese Reza said you’d get me out. - It was all empty promises! - Shut it. I’ve been stuck here... You believe everything they blame on me? Do you know Japanese Reza? Let’s go. Hamid! Are you out of your mind?! Take him back in. Why did you keep so much dope in the house? Ten people were supposed to come take it, but some got scared and didn’t show up So I was left with the dope. Find the bastard Japanese Reza Ask him how can i clean up his shit! What’s he done? Some guy has killed a cop’s kid He claims he was one of my guys. This way I’ll be charged for every crime in Tehran! The one who killed the cop’s kid, was he your guy or not? He was my partner’s guy. So why isn’t he following up on your case? Because I don’t know the location of his biggest kitchen. What about the other one? We’re partners in that one! I can’t rat out myself! Vahid you said Japanese Reza was following up on my case. He was nice to me on the phone. But he was real upset when I talked to him. What did you do to him to get him so upset? The Japanese were his customers but they came to me without his knowledge. Why is he getting even if he doesn’t know? I don’t give a shit if he finds out! He should’ve thought of it before he set up a kitchen on his own! - So you did something to get him mad. - Whatever! Make him get me out of here! What if he doesn’t? He has to! Vahid, forget about the lawyer. Listen to me! Go to his house Follow him wherever he goes. What for? I swear on my mother’s life if he doesn’t get me out by morning I’ll tell the cops everything I know. Go in! - Do you know who ratted me out? - It’s better if you don’t know. Don’t drive me crazy! Answer me! Elham. How did they find Elham? Her uncle. Hassan the cow. Hassan the cow fucked up Why did she rat me out? What do you expect of a poor girl you dumped a year ago and won’t let go? If they can’t get you out call the guy you know. They found out about him last year and made him retire. Samad! Samad! Soldier! Open the door! What’re you doing?! Open the damn door! Sit here, I’ll find you some pills! I’m burning up! Samad! You animal! Where do you think you are?! Shut your mouth and get your superior! I’m his superior Lower your voice! Turn on the fans! We’re suffocating! Why’ve you packed up the place? Are you collecting slaves?! Sergeant, Can you give him a pill to calm him down? You shut up and sit down. I’ll send you to solitary if you raise your voice again. You don’t have any empty cells, otherwise I’d already be in one! I have an empty toilet. Wanna go there? Would you dare talk to me like this if we were on the outside?! I wanna know if you’d dare look me straight in the eyes! If you weren’t a cop, would you dare come closer than 500 meters? you all - Let me shut him up - Stop. Your buddy hit me for something I hadn’t done Wait and see how I’ll tie him and beat him up! You deserved it and he did me a favor! Thank your lucky stars I’m an official and can’t beat you up. Otherwise I’d do what every one of their families would like to do to you A product of your deeds! He’s a hooligan among these folks. Not another sound out of you. Pour some on me. Here! Here! Have you had dinner? No. I get a stomachache from spaghetti. What do you want? I can get you something to eat. Nothing thanks. Why not? Pizza? Kabob? Really? - Is Kabob okay? - Pizza. Ashkani! Yes sir? Call and get a pizza delivered for this kid. Charge it to you? Charge it to the office Hamid, bring that to me when you sign it. What happened doc? He distracted me. I broke the castor oil. Son, go get a mop from the back. Go from the side. Son, I could be your father. I’m too old to quit and don’t want to quit. What’s he talking about? Give him a pill and let him sleep. He’s obnoxious! I’m not giving him any pills or syrups! Is this it? That’s a broom not a mop. Give me a pill or take me to the hospital! I may die on your hands! If you die I’ll put in the report death due to drug withdrawal. Jerk! Can I go to my dad? Aren’t you uncomfortable in there? I wanna be with my dad. Samad, Hamid’s gone. Gone? Why? Because of the report he signed in your place. Take the kid to his dad. Sergeant! Don’t die a minute, I’ll be right back. What’s this silliness about? Why did you have me sign the report? Were you running away? Samad I’ve had enough troubles in this job. I don’t want to go to jail for something I haven’t done. - Fine - Let me go! Fine, we just want to talk. Go in. What are you doing? Why are we going this way? Belt, mobile phone, shoelace, watch, coins take it all off. - Why? - So you don’t run off again. What’re you trying to do? Samad, let’s go. - This has nothing to do with you, go. - Stay here. You wanna put me in there? I’ll talk to your judge in the morning. - You were there. You saw for yourself! - I wrote down what I saw. You wrote no one saw the suspect and you got the dope from me! Is that a lie? Who saw anything? If anyone saw anything they should tell me and I’ll tear up the report. I could’ve caught him if I’d made any noise? - Did you catch him? - So where did I get the dope from? I told you where I saw his shadow, how far I chased after him, and where I lost him! But you’ve written the report as if I lied! Explain it to the judge and you’ll be free to go if he believes you! - And what if he doesn’t? - I’m not the one who chased the guy! - If I don’t give your name I’ve got to give mine. - Do it! - If he doesn’t believe me? - You think he’ll believe me?! You’re being a sissy. I’m still going to court everyday... ...for your incompetence six months ago! But I never gave your name! Don’t expect me to sign the report! What my wife will do If this gets added to my file Samad! Stop saying my name! My life’s hanging from a thread! Why don’t you think of my family! Get in! Why me? Why not someone else?! Because six months ago we got the suspect but lost the dope, - And now we have the dope but no suspect! - What’s it to do with me?! Maybe the dope you got off the suspect no one saw, is the same dope we lost before! - What’re you saying Samad?! - I’m not saying anything. - You just did. - I did and I stand by it. We’ll go to court and tell the judge we lost 50 grams six months ago, Now we find it again on another mission! He’ll have me arrested till further discovery! Your record is clean, just think what he’ll do to me! Shame on you! Get lost! Go inside! What’re you looking at?! Don’t shut the door. Stop it and get in. I won’t. Let’s see what you’ll do. Haven’t you been taught to do what your superior tells you? I arrested half the people in there and you wanna throw me in with them?! Please, cut him a break! We’re looking like fools! I’ll cuff him so he can’t get away! I’ll file a complaint against you! I’ll do it myself! You thought I was running away?! I thought he might think that and pin it on you. I’ll be here, you can leave now. Move over. Incoming. Everyone stand up. Hurry in! Go Go - Vahid? - I was with Japanese Reza just now. - And? - He said he’ll get you out. Don’t worry. That’s good if it’s true, but what if it’s a lie? He left the house a few minutes later with his bags. And? He headed out of town and I’ve followed him. Are you sure it’s him? Yes. Should I stay here or go? It seems dangerous. - No! - No! Stay right there and send me the address. Bye. - Bye - Give me the pills. - What pills? - The ones you stole. - Me? - You want me to raise my voice? - I didn’t see any pills. - So you didn’t take them? - No. We only had one pack of Tramadol and you took it. - Come here. - Is that you? - Yes. You took the pills and hid them in your pants. Yes. - So why did you say you didn’t take them? - I didn’t take them. Then who’s that? Me. The camera shows you taking the pills and hiding them. Can I go to my dad? I don’t want any pizza! If I show this to the judge he’ll double your sentence. - Am I going to prison? - Yes. If not for this, you’ll definitely go for your father’s drugs. - But I’m a kid. - You’ll go to children’s prison. My dad said children didn’t go to prison! You said the drugs were yours. If you say the’re your dad’s you can go home right now. You gave the pills to your bastard father? Your father’s a bastard! Watch your mouth! Doc! Stop it! Go in your office. The pizza’s here. Okay. What do you want with your pizza? Soda? Soda I’ll ask you a question. Just don’t say you didn’t take the pills because I’ll get mad and tear up the entire jail. Did you give the pills to your dad or someone else? I didn’t take the pills. If you don’t tell me the truth, I can’t send you to solitary because you’re a kid but I’ll send your dad. I swear I don’t know. So you won’t tell me. Eat your pizza. Where did he go? To see your dad. Sir! - Sergeant! - Don’t you want your pizza? - Open this gate! - I want to go in the cell! - Hurry! - My dad doesn’t have it You want the pills? I’ll give them to you Don’t go in there. Please! - Where’s the kid’s father? - Here - Come here! - Why? - You’ll know when I put you in solitary! - But why? - Come here and bring the pills! - What pills? He doesn’t have them. I have them. - Then give them to me. - Okay. Leave and I’ll bring them to you. I have the pills If you wanna put the lame man in solitary do it for his other crimes. That’s none of your business Give me the pills. I took a few myself and gave some to those who needed it. Does the kid have to stay in here? If you felt sorry for him you wouldn’t have him stealing pills for you! Handcuff him Go finish your pizza The lame guy is pinning his drugs on his son and you won’t do anything about it? As long as the kid says they’re his, even the judge can’t do anything about it. He’s a kid! He’s got a record He’s not a regular kid. Then why’s he so afraid of going to prison? The last times he had private plaintiffs who dropped the charges What’s it got to do with you? Tamper his file and send him home. And what should I tell the judge? Put it all on me and send both of ‘em home. The pills are working magic on you! And what’ll you tell the judge? Maybe we’ll raise the price and you’ll tear up the records and we won’t get to the judge. Such a nice guy! How did you fit all this dope in their stomachs? Prove they’re my guys and I’ll show you how much dope fits in a stomach. I’ll do the first round of questioning, with words. Someone else will do the second round, with kicks and punches. Ask me using tanks It won’t make a difference ‘cause I don’t know them. And you didn’t have them kidnap Hamid’s kid? - Of course not! - You’re lying. I’ll say this because we’re talking about a child I swear on my mother’s life, it wasn’t me. Was it Japanese Reza? Who’s that? Swear on your mother’s life that you don’t know him. Forget that. Tell me if you’ve made up your mind. I’ll think about it. You should think about yourself and tell me where he is. What’re you writing? You’ll get it however you want, cash, automobile, house deed Just text the amount to this number. Okay Write down Japanese Reza’s number and address I’ll help you out at the right place. - What place better than here? - A place you can’t imagine It’s too visible in here Write it down My family and I are not sellouts. If you had a real family you wouldn’t be here now. - Got a sister? - Watch your mouth. - Wait a second. - I’m warning you! I’ve got brothers and sisters and a mom and dad. Write it down, I’ll ignore the pills and won’t put you in solitary. Put me in solitary. - Is your last name Kalalei or Kolalei? - Kolalei I want to file a complaint. You couldn't keep me overnight with my lame leg? People have called and said drugs are sold in your kiosk. They’ve mentioned the kiosk, not me personally. - What’s the difference? - He lives there too Without plaintiffs you can’t keep me here There aren’t any plaintiffs but there are the drugs You were arrested while selling drugs I got it off the kid but it belongs to him. Did you see me give them to the kid? - How old are you? - Twelve. - Have you ever been to prison? - No. Tell me if it’s yours and I’ll cut down your sentence but if you lie I’ll give you the highest possible sentence. Sir, it’s not mine - I told you not to do these things! - Yes. Tell them how you bought it from a stranger in the park. Are you teaching him what to say?! Get out! The kid stays Take him out and stay out. - Vahid, whose dope is it? - Mine. If you don’t say it belongs to your dad you’ll have to go to prison. Can we both stay out of prison if I say it’s my dad’s? Whoever owns the drugs has to go to prison. Do you know if you go to jail you can’t get a job anywhere you want? Tell me it’s your dad’s and I’ll send you to your mother. She is gone Where is she? When she lived with her friends I’d sometimes visit her but... What about now? Don’t you ever visit her? No. What about her? Does she ever visit you? She saw my bad grades and came home and said she wouldn’t leave again. So that I could study She woke me up in the morning, made me breakfast and took me to school! She said she’d pick me up after school. But she didn’t! When I got home no one opened the door! I stayed behind the door until night. - What grade are you in? - I didn’t go to school after that. Say the drugs belong to your dad and I’ll send you to stay with a relative. I don’t have any! I don’t know anyone! Talk instead of crying Tell me the truth. So I won’t have to send you to prison instead of your dad. Send me wherever you want. Just leave me alone... Out! Hurry out! Out! Open up! Open it! Open it! Ashkani, gather ‘em up And take that one this away. Don't push! Get Back! Take him out Come here! The rest from the other side That way! Pay attention to what I say. Every one I call should go out the back door and head to court Those in front should open a path to the back and wait for the bus Move back Move back. - Am I free? - Where will you get off? Have you made the call? - It was deposited. - So? - So, where’ll you get off? - Right here. We’ll drop you off somewhere better. Have you lost your mind? He’s handcuffed me to someone like you Delivering you would guarantee his promotion! - Why’d he ever let you go?! - So it’s just for a promotion? What else? Did you get the money? Pull over. Pull over. Pull over! Let him out. Are you serious? You think I’m joking? Go Samad? Let him go. Samad?! Let him go! Go! Just don’t tell anyone we got money off you. Samad! He’s getting away! Drive What’s all this mean? I’m helpless here Stop playing games. I’m not selling my honor for a few pennies. What honor? You don’t have the guts! You’re scared. All of you. Scared of you? No, scared of money Lot’s of money. Billions. I made a mistake. You don’t deserve that much You would’ve made a deal over a few million Every person has a price I don’t understand a few billion but I definitely understand hundreds of billion But your number’s real low You can’t fathom big numbers Your brain can’t handle it It can handle a maximum of five or six zeroes at best! You made this money with honest labor? You don’t need physical labor, you need guts! I wanted to beat you up to make you neigh like a horse but now I see having you simmer is much better! You should thank me instead of beating me up If not for me you would’ve never seen the inside of a penthouse worth billions Just for that you should’ve given me a straight yes or no answer Stop being an ass! Did you buy that house in a year? If I wanted to take bribes I could’ve gotten one in a week by skinning people like you Skinning?! I wanted to hand you money and you were terrified! Why would I take money that’s brought misery to millions of people? Do you know how many people have lost their lives to your drugs? Do you know who spent the night in the solitary cell you occupied? Some guy who high on crack cut his wife to bits and raped his ten-year-old daughter! You should beg the judge to expedite your execution instead of struggling to get free! To go where? Ruin how many more lives? I just don’t like prison and having my family displaced. That’s all. Nasser Khakzad I’ll make you feel the misery of every person whose life you’ve ruined! Every single person caught with your dope who was executed or received a life sentence without knowing who you were! Are you punishing me or threatening me? He’s trying to turn you into a better person. Yeah, go ahead and make fun of me with the guy who kidnapped your child What’re you talking about?! Remember the night you called Hamid and his wife telling them to come pick up their child alive? No because I don’t know what you’re talking about! Yes you do! Where were you hiding when his wife held her five-year-old child in her arms?! I’d never do such a thing! Instead of that old rotten blanket couldn’t you have spent a few dimes to wrap his dead child in a new blanket?! I don’t have the heart for it! I swear I never did the things he says! When you called telling them to pick up the child she thought her child would be running into her arms. How can I make you believe it wasn’t me? I swear I’m not cut out for such things! Everything I’ve done has been for the young! It’s all been for my nieces and nephews! I’m not into kidnapping! I can’t kill a child! You speak about guts! If you had any you wouldn’t kidnap a child! You wouldn’t have killed it! And you wouldn’t have dragged them on thinking their child was alive! - It’s just the start! - I told you it wasn’t me! - Then tell me who it was! - I swear it was Japanese Reza! Swearing won’t do any good All the evidence points to you If it’s not you, then give me his address I will, but don’t ever say I killed a child! Don’t spread that rumor! I’m glad you gave me a name Now give me an address. I’ll give you an address I don’t know if I’m awake or dreaming But if I’m awake and you’re doing all this to me you should be scared for the rest of your life Scared of you? No, I’m done for But scared of everything else Even your own shadow Instead of this bullshit tell me if you’ll hand over Japanese Reza. I’ll only do it for the sake of your child Make a U-turn Good Boy! Turn around We’re going back Our suspects will go to court tomorrow. Go to the back Two in the back and two on this side. Hurry! Go that way Samad can’t take part until Hamid’s file is cleared. Boss, don’t say that in front of the guys. No! Ashkani hand him off and follow me. Samad, don’t take your eyes off him. Over there You too. Put your hands on your head and come out! Drag him out! Shut up and come out. I haven’t done anything! I’m just a welder. Yeah right! How many in here? I said how many are you? - Where’s Japanese Reza? - Who’s that? - Where’s the kitchen? - What kitchen? What kitchen? Who are you trying to warn? Tell me. Are you gonna talk or not? Underground. Get up! Be careful. Keep your eyes open. Hurry up! Look at all this! Ashkani, hurry! Samad keep your eyes open. Hurry up! Send him first. Be careful. Vahid! Vahid! Vahid! Vahid! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Ali Rostami. Ali Rostami aka Nasser Khakzad. What‘ll happen with the case of Hamid Moazeni’s child? That case has to go to penal court The lawyer realizes he can’t interject during questioning? Yes sir. I will only listen. Did anyone else die at the cow ranch? Five of them and one of our guys Ashkani and Shahbazi are in the hospital. Why was he called Japanese Reza? Did he look Japanese? No, it was because he worked with the Japanese He killed himself like the Yakuza before getting caught. What’s your explanation about their drugs? No one’s dope belongs to me. Whatever they have is theirs. What about the ones in your house? Yes, that was in my house. Sir, everyone knows we worked for him! Who is everyone? Give me a name so I’ll know too. You’ll have a chance to speak The crime of carrying and dealing drugs is no less than making drugs When will I know what’ll happen to me? The review of this case may take a year or longer. Why? Multiple records, multiple identities, faking your death... ...and statements made against you by others, eleven of whom are serving long sentences abroad This is just part of your file. Killing a child. Fadavi, get me a green sheet What was the exact amount of drugs confiscated from his house? Six kilos. Six kilos with packaging. 5.7 without. What? Six kilos? What do you think? Six grams?! Are you gonna say it was planted in your house?! No. It’s mine. But it wasn’t six kilos It was eight Our deal was you’d either take all or none. Are you talking to me? What deal? I asked if you had customers for it and you said you did! God only knows how many people like me he’s... ...ruined Taking our dope and having us executed! There’s closed-circuit cameras all over there. If what he says is true you’ve got to go to jail. - Me? - Yes you. Why? Because we don’t get the films from the cameras on time. I swear on my kid’s life he’s lying! If that works I’ll swear on something and be home for lunch! Settle down! What’s he saying? I’ve written down everything and handed it to the court. You think I’m an idiot? You said if I handed over Japanese Reza you’d change the report to six grams so I’d only get a few years! The deal wasn’t you’d take two kilos and leave me with six! What difference does six or eight kilos make when the sentence for both is execution?! You’re such a bastard! Fine, I’m a bastard. Where’s the two kilos? There’s a big difference between six grams and six kilos! I swear he’s lying. You know me! Stop swearing and explain Prove it was six kilos and I’ll decide if it’s true or not. Are you falling for what he’s saying? How can I tell he’s lying? I have witnesses. My colleagues. - Who? - Hamid Moazeni. Don’t leave Your previous file hasn’t been closed yet. He is right outside. I’m ask him to come in. Go with him soldier. Look at us! The guy’s telling the judge that I’ve nicked two kilos off his dope! The judge asked if I had a witness, I said you could explain. Come tell them he’s lying. Why don’t you explain my case to the prosecutor first? Okay, but he’s waiting now. I won’t come until you clear my case. - Where is your file? - Right there. - This one? - Yes Let’s go! Come On What? You think I’m gonna escape?! Were you in charge? Yes. - Then why did he sign the report? - Because Hamid found the drugs. The suspect threw the bag as he was running away The wall was too high and it fell in the street When we walked in the house the suspect ran away Hamid chased him and managed to get the drugs, but the suspect got away. - Did you see it? - Yes I did. You wrote that no one else saw the suspect - Are you claiming you saw him? - I meant I didn’t see his face, I saw his shadow and noticed him running on the rooftop. But I didn’t recognize him. If I see a suspect throw something away, shouldn’t I pick it up? It was my mistake. We depend on Hamid in all our missions He’s a key member of our team These things happen. It’s happened to me too He’s one of the candidates for station chief. Rewrite your report. Yes sir. So? You can go. You can go. Let’s go. Thanks very much. Let’s go. Thanks very much. - How much was it? - Eight kilos. Six kilos, 12 packs. I’m asking him. I think it was 14 or 15 packs. 14 or 15 packs means 16 packs! Each pack is half a kilo that comes to eight! Didn’t you bring in the drugs together? We did, but he weighed them I don’t know who he took along to deliver them. The person in charge was there, so was Ashkani and there’s closed-circuit cameras! Why don’t you have them bring in the film? It’ll take a couple of days. Were these two ever alone together? Yes, several times. Why don’t you have them search his house? Soldier, take him away, he can’t keep his mouth shut. It was eight kilos. Shut up already! What do I want with all that dope? Have them search my house! So that’s how it is then?! - I am only telling what I saw. - Is that what you saw? I’ll have you detained for now and will call you up when I have more time. Don’t you think you’ve made a mistake? I’m the cop and he is the suspect! Your previous file hasn’t been cleared yet and now you’re accused of a similar act. You want to keep me here for a few days until the films arrive?! I have to write a request and it’ll take a few days for it to get here Take him away. Nice job Hamid! Nice job! Sir, the soldier is his inferior. Do you want me to take him myself? Do it - Watch your hand. - It’s my duty to take you downstairs. - Okay, but let go! - Go ahead. I’ll do it. - What’re you doing? - Shut your mouth! The judge told me to take you myself. - He told you? - Yes, get going! - Do you know what you’re doing? - Keep walking. - Let me call the station. - I don’t have the permission to allow you. What I did was work related, but you’re making it personal Just let me make a call! - Did I put you in with them? - You wanted to but couldn’t! Which of you has a phone? If you give it to me I’ll lighten your file. What’ll you give me if I tell you who has one? - Whatever you want. - Cash I don’t have any cash here. - Raise your leg. - What? Let me see your shoes Is it an original? Guys hand over the shoes. Don’t give it to him. Pass these up. It’s in the right one. Don’t give it to him. Do I know you? Just return the phone once you make the call... Let him go! Hello? I’m sergeant Majidi Rezai is it you? Listen... I’m in trouble at the court. You’ve got to do me a favor I need the film from the close-circuit cameras - What’s going on?! - It’s very important! From two nights ago Take personal time off, just get it to me. I don’t have an hour! Two nights ago. Yes. Get it here. Hurry Eight. That’s four kilos Nine Ten Eleven Twelve That’s all we weighed and handed over. Six kilos. Very well. You’re free to go. I said I wasn’t sure. You can go. Yes sir. Thanks. Fadavi! Excuse me sir. What’s the sentence? The child will go to reform school for three years. Can’t you forgive me? I’ll make it two years. What about me? The child will go to reform for two years. The father is free to go. Thank you sir! Let’s go son. So I ruined all these people on my own? The price of crack has gone from 200 million to 30 million When supply goes up prices come down When prices come down it becomes easier to access With easier access people use more, or start using None of this would happen if it weren’t for me? Over the past months that you’ve been in jail the... ...price of crack has gone from 30 to 85 million. Someone else will build a kitchen tomorrow and... ...it’ll go back to 30 million. You can’t stop it. Don’t worry about that They’ll end up right here one by one We didn’t do this stuff out of pleasure We needed money. That’s all. A lot of people claim you gave them drugs Several kilos each, for a total of 500 kilos! When the sentence for 30 grams or 500 kilos is execution you might as well go for more and make some money to make up for your childhood woes! Who gave you the right to ruin so many people for your childhood woes?! We couldn’t pay for a kidney for my older brother and he died. We bought him a shroud for 6 Toomans per meter Next door we bought some black cloth for mother’s mourning clothes for 4 Toomans per... ...meter, why do we have to bear it all the time? What a childish excuse! Should everyone who goes through a tragedy cook crack? Have you ever met someone who became a father figure for ten people older than him? There was seven of us, and four of my siblings’ children Eleven living in a tiny damp house, at the end of an alleyway The mason refused to repair it. He said the clay was dead I bought a washing machine and its top and bottom rusted off in three months! Who knows what the damp did to my parent’s bones. If you have anything to add, write it here and... ...sign My ears have had it listening to you. I’m sorry for your ears! Why didn’t you quit when you were released last time? You had money then. My eyes were still hungry. Fadavi! Ghezelhesar Prison. Go in Hi Hello It stinks, The smell of addiction. Does he need to be here? He’s a student intern. Sit - Go outside and come back later. - Yes sir. That’s not necessary. Stay and learn. Sit down. You didn’t tell me your nieces and nephews are in Canada. Why would I need to tell you? - Because you sent them there. - So what? - Did they move drugs for you? - They’re my family. Stop playing around and give me a straight answer. Straight how? I sent them to study Yes, but you paid for them with drug money. - Do you still have the old house? - Yes, it’s rented. So they have a place to return to. Sign these three places. Who? Read, sign here and place a fingerprint. Why would they come back? Everything in your name and the name of your immediate family that you earned with drug money is confiscated. - You won’t do that. - I won’t. The law will. All they have is in their name. It’s in their name, but you gave it to them. It’s theirs. My dad bought it himself. Did your dad sell crack too? What do you want with my family? Why’re you talking like that? Your father’s pension is 1.5 million per month How could he afford an 1800 square meter house up town? My dad spent a lifetime working uptown. Let him live there for a couple of years before he dies If every child of a laborer thinks like that nothing will last! - Why would you issue this sentence? - It hasn’t been issued yet It’ll come from a higher court not me Why do you need to drag my parents out of their house? The evidence says these properties must be confiscated and we obey Sign it. I have to send the file. I won’t sign anything You won’t sign? Fadavi? Yes sir. Ghezelhesar Prison You dragged me here for this signature? No we brought you here to thank you for your good services! Sir, I don’t care if I live or die With five years of illegal activity I lived better than a king I don’t want anything from the world I’ve thought about dying and am not afraid. But... But you didn’t think of this part. Did you? Don’t do this to me. It’s nothing personal. I’m the one you’re dealing with What do you want with my family? Everything you’ve paid for will be confiscated From your brother’s car, to your mother’s jewelry and the house where they live. I’ll give the list to your lawyer. Hello sir. Take him away. Take it all, but leave the house One needs a certain spirit to live downtown... ...and my family doesn’t have it. Wait a moment. I sent those kids to Canada so they’d forget why their father died If you confiscate what they have and send them back where I grew up what do you think will happen to them They’ll turn out worst than me! I managed to set them on the right path I sent them to study Taught them not to punch people in the nose over nothing! - Remember the cop whose kid... - Yes He gave his consent. Vahid already told me. What made him do it? I don’t know yet. Did you fix it so my nieces and nephews would be able to complete their studies? As far as I know they have to come back, because we can’t support them financially. - But if I have the time... - Forget that. Leave it to Vahid. Just focus on getting me out and keeping the house from being confiscated. In this situation the issue of the house... I don’t like that house! I hate that alleyway! Don’t make my family go back there - Your father wants to go back. - Really? Yes. Have you seen it? No The alley is so tight that if two people come face to face one will have to back up so the other can get through You’re lucky if you can get to your home Why do we have to stand in line to get to our house? We’re not sheep! We’re human beings. We deserve more than a shed - What difference does it make now? - Why wouldn’t it? We got your sentence. And? Execution? File an objection! I did. It was rejected. So the cop gave his consent because he knew I’d be executed! You know what pisses me off? I did whatever I could... The night they came to arrest me I tried to commit suicide, I took 11 packs of pills If they’d arrived an hour later it would’ve all been over It pisses me off that I was already dead but they resurrected me so they could kill me themselves! It might be a scare tactic We may be able to find someone to get you out Then you won’t have to kill yourself... Why wouldn’t I? When I’ve tried to save everyone I know from misery only to find out they like being miserable! I bought them a house worth 30 billion you tell me they want to live in a shed in a dead-end street?! I sent five of ‘em to study abroad Only to find out that other than the two girls the rest are just having fun! When all your life boils down to one girl I spent five years of my life on her I know she’s with someone else I know she’s the one who ratted me out I know she doesn’t love me anymore But all I want is to see her one last time! Why wouldn’t I kill myself? She had nothing and I gave her everything I want to go Don’t let them take the house Mom, he’s here! Uncle! Uncle! - Did you change your gymnastics class? - Yes Did you join my friend’s gym? Yes. His English is pretty good too. - Did you learn how to do a cartwheel? - Yes What else do you know? Tumbling cartwheel handstand... You can do all that? - Here? - Yes, here. My clothes are too tight. I can’t do it. Yes he can. I’ll take off his clothes and he’ll show you. - How was Canada? - Excellent You couldn’t finish your studies? We got evaluated and will continue here. I’m sorry I couldn’t finish.... sorry Please don’t say that! Mom say something instead of crying We’re running out of time I wish I were in your place! I wanna die and not see these days! My love! Dad? Leila? Yes dear? Don’t do that. Try to calm them down. Who will calm me down? Who will mend my broken heart? Time’s up. Let’s go Don’t you see their time is up? Ignore them. Go ahead. Brother you’re still around and they don’t listen to me What will they do when you’re gone? He only comes home once a month! What’ll he do when you’re gone? Go on Do it Officer please do anything you can! - Who do you think he is? Stop begging! - Brother! Say something to Vahid! Tell him one brother in crime is enough! - Vahid! What’s she saying?! - The Japanese’s number! What do you want it for? - I’ve found a way, we won’t get stuck! - Don’t be stupid! They’ll find out! Don’t do it! Shut them all, Hurry Move It! Come forward. One by one starting here. You chose a desk job over being chief? Do you expect an explanation? I’ll resign my post and you’ll be the chief - What happened all of a sudden? - Who said it was all of a sudden? - If your seat’s got nails let me know. - Let me ask you something What was the difference between Nasser Khakzad and Reza Moradi? - Reza Moradi was Nasser Khakzad’s guy. - Who’s guy was Nasser Khakzad? His own. There you go. That’s what they’ve made us believe... ...that Nasser Khakzad’s the end of the line. He wasn’t? - If he was, we wouldn’t have caught him. - Are you okay? No! I am not ok Hamid When I got this job we had a million addicts Now we’ve got 6.5 million! We arrested so many people like Nasser Khakzad, gave them life sentences and executed them and we got 6.5 million instead of one! If we hadn’t done all that we’d have 20 million by now. So we should be pleased it’s not 20 million? I don’t like this type of thinking - It’s our job to do what they tell us - If it’s your job, here’s your seat Sit and do your job It doesn’t have any nails Let me go be with my family I don’t understand in this situation... Hamid let me be. Sir, I’d be grateful for a handout.
