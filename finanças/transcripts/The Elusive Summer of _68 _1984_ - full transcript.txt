In the spring of the, now long gone, year of 1968. it seemed to me that everyone have women of their lives, except me. Time passed by unrelently and I had strong feeling that soon something will happen to me, something grand and beautiful. I will fall in love. Yes, I will fall in love. I shorted my list and from that shorten list I singled out her. New professor of sociology, Nevena Moreno. All around her, she spread smell of south fruit, tropical seas and mornings after rain. But most important was that, she singled out me from the crowd. She looked at me. Because of her, just because of her, I've decided to take marxism for my marticulate theme. THE ELUSIVE SUMMER OF '68 At first, my choice was really surprising for my father. So, marxism? So suddenly? Through the whole year C, and now. Listen... Maybe you made a mistake? You know what that means to me. Don't change your mind by any chance. No, no. That and nothing else. Then, I'm proud of you. Barely 18 years old and already getting involved with giant of world's social idea. Son, look your father right in the eyes. You've made a descision that will meant a great deal in your life. I'll get somebody to help you. I'll do it by myself, I don't need anybody. Just to be sure. You listen to me. We gotta make it in our life. Modern society is made in that way, that every opposition turn to be useful at the end. You listen to me? - I do. - You don't listen anything. You oughta be ashame. And shame is form of revolution. - Here you are, conserve. Is that you, Vladica? - Here you are. Dad appointed student Cile to help me after all. He insisted that we together follow world's political events. He think that will help me with my marticular theme that I have chosen for my exam. He was death boring to me but he had cocnclusively influence on my sister Vladica. Dear viewers, good evening. In the beginining we'll have review of the most important domestic and worlds events. After 12 hours of demonstration in Paris, that turned into real battles between students and the police, there is nothing but desolation. What happened and what still can happened made rude wake up call from the dream about best of all the worlds. Busted skulls and other fructures don't count anymore. That's the battle that haven't been seen on the Parisian ground from the Second World War. Clashes, charged with hatred, are atrocious. At that time, my father have been preparing three months ahead for the duck hunting season. My younger brother Tadija, enjoyed in his childhood. You're done? He's sitting here for a half an hour and you didn't noticed. What is there to be noticed? Today I'm cleaning my guns. Don't bother me with some nonsense. It's over! It's getting close. - What? - Demonstrations. Student Cile says... - You hear what she's talking? What Cile! -Vladica, don't disturb your father. Tadija, you're too big to poop in the chamber-pot. You hear me? -I do. -So? -This way is better. And why? -Someone else is doing all instead of you . Mom, like every mom, had a job over her head. Get out! Begone! And don't you ever come into my house again! Father threw Cile out. He considered that he has negative affect on us. And politics didn't interested me at all. Day and night I was fantasizing about my professor of sociology, Nevena Moreno. I've decided to punish her cruely, and not to speak a word with her ever again. Petar, what's the meaning of Marx's concept of revolution? I knew that I will fail on exam but I stayed tough and resolute. Alright, tell me, who is only capable to accomplish revolution? Petar! Tadija, sit properly! Let's have lunch! Bravo, my son, bravo! Just like me, pass the exam from the first try. Right on time! Foundations of healthy diet, remeber that well, are: Green today, red tomorrow, and yellow day after tomorrow. More vegetables. Peas, tomato, paprika, cucumbers for every meal. And he gets the goose. -He's talking about me? Son, dad eats vegetables first and then meat. He got himself a meat first! -Give me some wine. My son passed the exam of maturity and we have to drink in that name. Petar!. Take the tankard, get in the wine cellar and you'll drink first! Hurry son, we have to go to visit grandpa in the hospital. Let him have some joy. Listen, Raka called from Belgrade. - And? Again about that thing. Our moving to Belgrade. We will think about it, for sure. Just, every smart man lives in a smaller place. It's healthier. - Sudents are in Belgrade. That's most important. And why that's most important? Because they're the only one who could make a change, if they rose up. And they will for sure. They've had enough. She means in France... -In France, really? -In Germany. And why she mentioned Belgrade? -She didn't, I did. I'm telling you about Raka. It will be good for Perica's studies. I waited for my father to find out that I didn't pass the exam and then to kill me. But instead of my punishment, in my life, so suddenly, walked in a new neighbour. Good afternoon. I am Olja Miranovski. We talked over the phone about the apartment. -Yes. Can I come in? -Of course. -Thank you. Olja Miranovski. Attention! From now on, in our town girl Orchestra from Czechoslovakia, Every night on Lido at 19 hours. Every sunday we were going to visit grandpa, who was in hospital cause of some unknown, but viscious and incurable disease. Grandpa. Wait a minute, Perica. Four queens. You skinned them? -Of course! Why they play if they don't know? Perica, is that true what they are talking about? -What? That some Czech girls arrived. What are they like? -Fine. Year '22 in Brno, jambree. Those were the days. Good afternoon. Grandpa skinned them all in poker. -Of course! Dad, this is the hospital after all. I hardly persuaded a director to take you in, and you're acting like this! -These are my last days, and I won't deprive myself anything. -You won't, of course. Last days which last 20 years. What did you bring me? Why so little? Little? Here's roasted goose, carrot, potato. Sheep cheese. Aged? -Aged. -Then hoacake, pie and pancakes with walnuts. Dad, if I ate all of this I would die. Cowards die thousand times, and brave just once. Where are spices? Where's garlic? -Here with sour milk. And salt? Salt it's forbidden for you! Then all of this is for nothing! Take it! Dad, please, don't! It's forbidden. Don't! Please, let me eat and drink in peace. Cheers! -Cheers! Dad, Perica pass the exam. Son, tell him a details. -I know, I know. Rector of the highschool have told me. Congratulations, my boy! Don't worry, I failed three times. And diet grandpa? -Only for tonight. True. Maybe this is your last night. Good day, pleasent meal. -Good day. Dad, please hurry. It's going to rain. How did you came? Not on the bikes? -We did. You black sheep of the family! What are you doing? This is century of science, by yourself a car. If you need them, you buy them. Yes! When I needed them, I bought them. And not one but two. You have pictures at home. See how grandpa was driving. How, when father doesn't allow to see your pictures. Why? -There are always two or three ladies with you. Dear guests. I have the honour to present you, our guests from Czechoslovakia! Orchestra Palenky! That means dolls like you can see. I hope that you can understand now why I was telling you so much about my Czech semesters. Whole four years! Czech is right here! There was plenty to feel, see, smell, to taste... And you could find something for brave hands. Last night's incident in University campus in New Belgrade it's not just incident anymore. What it looked like just a rugged and hooligan ending of one well concieved night, today got a new form. Violent fightings that shook the University campus, were just a cause for a long student kolumn to start at noon their march from New Belgrade to the very downtown. Crowd of the distrubed students demostrants in their march, police have been stopped on the road near building of Federal Chamber. Soon after that dramatic events took place, and there was clash between the police and students. So far we know that there are injuries but there were no casualties. Where to? -Swimming. -Get back! You wanna get shock from temperature difference. First sit here in a shade for five minutes, both of you. Saska llic, apothecary. All aorund herself she spread a irresistible smell of essentialoils, hot summer and sunny sands. Put something under my head. And pour me some vine. I forgot it. -How did you forget it? We came to the beach without wine. -Less wine, less wine. -Silence! What do you think of? -If we had a car we could do it easily. Petar! Go get wine! Take a shortcut. Be here in 20 minutes. I'll measure the time. Go! Hi. What are you doing? -We're preparing attack on Czech. Join us, we're stronger togehter. I can't, I must go to get wine for my father. Good afternoon. -Good afternoon. You are Olja Miranovski, our new neighbour? How do you know? -I know. Petar Cvetkovic, student. What do you study? -Politics. I'm interested in marxism. And you? -I finished only school for library. I got spot in your city library. Can you show me way to the beach? -Of course. That's where I'm going. I'll show you. I don't have a bike. -Take mine. I will run, it's not hard for me. It's close. -No way. You just show me the way, I'll find it. It's not that close. Alright, then give me a ride. You drive well? -No problem. What she's saying? -Asking for a name. Him? Djoka. -Him. Pera. What is she doing? Reading newspapers. -Is that the way to read a newspaper? Vladica, come here! Perica, is not hard for you to blow this up? I will do it, just to bring wine to my father. Perica, only top button. Perica got a girlfriend. Perica got a girlfriend. What does he babbling about? What girlfriend? Big girlfriend. Brother got a girlfriend. You, who where you talking to overthere? What do you smell... Where were you mooching? You smell on perfume. -I just show her way to the beach. What do you have to show her a way?! How it can be that no one on the street, not one perfumed girl, ask me not you? -Don't hit me! Who're you talking to? Is he talking to me? -Of course. I don't understand why did you hit him. What did he do? See how he's talking to me. And you don't understand, right?! Who is the father here, me to him or him to me? These are the same ones that made riots in Germany and France. Their fathers feed them, and they're demostrating. Now this one in Belgrade. A frog sees how big is the horse, so she wants to become one. It's not going to happen! -We're going too. -Where? To help demonstrators in Belgrade. There is Cile with students, they're preparing to go to Belgrade. Nobody will move from here! He is some student!? He's studying 100 years already! He's eating someone else's bread, and he wants to change my world! We came here on a fresh air, to swim and sunbath. That's it! Let's go on the sun. Dear visitors, temperature is rising, now it's 32 degrees Celzius. We wish you a pleasent dwelling on our Lido! Here are some more waltz. Right here! Lay down! Don't you look at those punks overthere. Cile is taking care of himself. And eats pie and yogurt. He agitates. -And everything he says it's true. Do you see what he's doing? How can I see when you told us to lay down? You, stand up. Bring me the pills. -For the stasis or apetite? You see I'm barely breathing. Why would I need for apetite? So for the stasis. My head is bursting. Less wine, less wine! Pardon judge. Can you spare me a moment? Excuse me madam. I haven't heard anything. -Yesterday in Belgrade. Students bariccaded in the faculties and won't come out. You know what paroles they were using? Down with social differencies! Down with red burogoisie! Down with the corruption and down with just one set of people in power! Come on, nonsense! I don't know nothing. You didn't say anything, I haven't heard anything. We're on the beach, for God's sake! -Alright but... -There's no but! We drudge, we're working here and we don't have time for that. Excuse me, but I still have something to say to you. My wife is complaining. -On students? No, no. On your son, Perica. -Excuse me? Perica is not a child anymore and he started to act, little indecent. How do you mean indecent? -Well, breathing down her neck. Breathing? -Yes. You see, everytime she go to shop, he is always there, behind her and always so close, so she can feel him. Like this... That's what I had to say to you. And I beg you to do something. -I will. Don't worry I will. And where is your wife so I can apologize? Here, if you please. I'm sorry, it will not happen again. -Let's hope so. Good afternoon. -How did you teach your son? It's always my fault. Excuse me, please. Highschool rector was looking for you. -What does he want? -I don't know. Pera is like our grandpa, so am I. Good day. -You probably heard. I haven't heard anything and I don't know anything. You have to know. Believe me, there's nothing I could do. We're friends,I respect you. Your father especially. But I couldn't do anything. About F's in geoography and history, I fixed that, but on matriculation exam your Perica didn't say a word. Not a word? You know professor of sociology? Take a look at her body. Look at those curves. You see, how can I say that, in that motherly curves, Perica was looking inproprietly, and he didn't say a word of the matter. Believe me, we had to plough him. Every member of comission was there, I couldn't do anything. I understand. Petar! My son to get F from marxsism! At this particular moment! And he's hiding that! He gave you his word... -What word? If he knows what honour is, he wouldn't allow the whole town to laugh at me! Son of county judge failed on matricular exam! I made a great sacrifice sou you can be able to be doctor, architect, engineer or judge some day! I don't want to be a judge. -What did you say? -Nothing. Answer my question, you hear. -I don't want to be a judge! -You won't? Pull down your pants! It seems like the war in Vietnam is reaching its climax these days, judging by American war operations and by bloody retaliation on innocent Vietnamese people. Pentagon is saying that right now, over the North Vietnam 8 American planes and 9 helicopters were destroyed. But Pentagon is keepenig the exact informations about how many pilots have been killed, saying just that, 382 pilots and 289 other crew members died over South and North Vietnam. Saygon is saying that French goverment firmly refused wishes of South Vietnam for restitution of diplomatic relations. De Gaulle is constantly convicting American interferance in the war and demands that South Vietnam... You, stand up! Say good night to your father, mother, sister and brother. Why good night? It's day. -It's night for you. Very dark night. Understood? -Understood. Good night. Where are you going? -We're solidary. Excuse me? I didn't say anything. -You did, with your look. Like you don't know, in what state our society is today. Veso, what's wrong with you? No one can object you anything. You recently joined the Party, you're new. -Exactly! My son must have at least B in marxism! They forgot how to bring up children. Today it's coming back to them. Under my roof that would not be the case! Period! Petar! Petar! From tomorrow you must not pass by the drug-store. That's first. Second: Sign up into a library and read all about marxism. Clear? -Clear. What's clear? Repeat. -I can't pass by drug-store, to sign up into a library and to read all about marxism. That's right. That night I firmly decided to listen to my father. I would not pass by the drug-store, but I will sign up into library, for sure. And read everything about marxism. Olja Miranovski. Bring it! Come on! Bravo, dog, bravo! One more time, bring it! Come on, don't do it mechanically. Come on! Dog, doggy! Here you horse. Bring it here. Sit! Sit! Don't do it mechanically,you horse! Capital can be created in productive process before and it must be created in it, before learning... Capital can be created in productive process and it must be created in it, before learning to master its own extrems. You're learning, I see. Marxism, son. Marxism is not like the other matter, geography for example. You can live, even if you don't know, where is Abu Dhabi, Singapore, Singhal. Or from the history, when did king Milutin came to a throne. But marxism, you must simply know it. Do you understand? It will follow you your whole life. Marxism is pervading all the pores of our society. It's truly neccesary. Do you understand that? I do. And you had to join the Party in your late ages to progress. -Who said that? Who? That's not true, I didn't have to. I always wanted to join. I felt that so intimate and deep inside of me. There just were no conditons... You're investigate me? You want me to slap you behind your ear? Hoodlum! You have a big mouth, but don't know anything from the matter! Come on, say something from the book! Say it! -What to say? Veso! Phonecall! Read that from A to Z, from cover to cover. I will examine you. Who is it? -Belgrade. -Why me? What do I have to do with Belgrade? Hang up, that's some provocation. Buddy Raka. -And what if isn't Raka? Are you insane? Taking calls from Belgrade in moments like this. Hang up! We don't go to Belgrade. I have no attention of doing that. Raka about those hooks you were looking for. Hang up. Not a word! Hooks! They want to play with me. Hooks? You won't hooked me. They said on television last night, that public rallies are forbbiden in Belgrade. And you're goggle into TV? Goggle! And what did I say? Sealed until until further notice! Hello, Perica. What are you doing here? -I came to sign up. Nice. Come on. Plenty of meat. And I am a vegeterian. Enough! Turn it off! How many of this kind of movies you played in your restaurant? Five. Where did you get them from? -From Germany. Actually from Denmark. That's the best quality. You know that's forbbiden? -I didn't know. And customers don't mind at all. -Take him. This should be locked until the inquest. After the trial it should be burned infront of comission. What do you think, what fine he will get? -Maximum they can. Let's see what happened next. Dog! On the spot, dog! Sit! Bravo, dog! Summer. -Elusive. - What is elusive? You said summer. And it's really elusive. It's raining so often. Where is he? Did he go to the library? -Three times. Why three times? -First time, to sign up, second time, to pick up the books, and third, to pay for the membership. And now? -He went for the fourth time. -Why now? -To sign up Jova and Djoka. You see how it worked? Even an animal you can learn, and not one young hot head. You just need... -Hand of steel! Let's have lunch. You scared me. I feel that something is breathing down my neck. You want something? -Yes. You want some book? -No. What then? You. That's new generation! Everything without effort, without work, without knowledge. They just want to enjoy! And breath down women's necks. If we have a car, he would be at home more. He'd be doing something around engine. And everything would be fine. I will employ him at my friend Spasoje. He will be working hard. His back would be broke from the hard work! And what about the school? Let him finish that highschool. Let him learn what's working class. He'd be work by day, and learn by night. That's marxism in practice. -I'm not sure. Well, I am! Said-done. Turn it off! Here you are. Thank you very much. Good morning, buddy. -Hello, buddy. I brought my kid, like we agreed. Don't worry. He will be just fine. Come on kid! You know that Spasoje engaged? -Again? It's like he got right this time. I found her through some connections. Healthy, strong. Not like these girls today. And most important, virgin. My fiancee, your boss. Good afternoon. -Hello. Take off your pants. Why are you staring? Pants! You see that truck? Don't stop until you unload all that flower! Not much. Four and half tone. Her name was so simple, Jagodinka Simonovic. She smell like fresh pastry, salt pretzels and bake leaven. Go play outside, Vilkica. Why are you looking at me like that for two days now? You fell in love? -You're engaged. That's right. Pera, Perica! What? -Nothing. I just wanted to hear your voice. Where is your tie, dad? Even if it's hot like hell? -There must be an order in hell too. This is not some village but civilized town. We're not some village bakers I've learned my trade in Belgrade. In civilization there's a system. And inside that system are, you father, you brother and me. Order must come from our family, and not from some students. Jagodinka. -What is it? -Nothing. Just wanted to hear your voice. You just knead, it won't hurt you. Get out! What does it mean? -From now on you can watch television. Comrade Tito said, that students are right. Petar, hold this. Phone! Must be Raka. Daughter, tonight is quiz. Hello? Fine. Alright. You say, you're satisfied with work in a bakery? Do you hear your father? You see that he's on cloud nine. We're bothering you? What did you ask? How is it for you in a bakery? -Great. - Really? Really great? -I think so. And why did Spasoje called me then? Watch on that TV. I think it was about you. Why did he banish you from a bakery? That's 'cause of that breasted baker woman. You raff! Hoodlum! I understand your age, puberty, but why her, friend's future wife?! You bastard! After the speech he made, president Tito is still receiving telegrams from all parts of our country. Till tonight president recieved over 600 letters and telegrams. Worker's collectives, social- politic organizations, students and citizens are honestly expressing their assent with Tito's words and they're saying that, like they were solidary in accepting social and economy reforms, they are solidary now to conduct those reforms until their goals. Telegrams and letters also confirmed, that workers are eagerly waiting decisions from the head of the Party promising that they will put maximum effort to to revive those ideas. In the most telegrams, that Tito received from the students, it's confirmed, that they are categorically insist on coherent realization of Tito's conception of our way into the socialism. Foreign agencies mainly did properly informed their publicity about reactions of Yugoslavian students on Tito's speech. While the situation still was tense last night, journalist of France Press is saying, just one speech that Tito made on TV, made all disappear. Almost all of students and professors of Belgrade University unanimously agreed that after one week strike they will continue their work on Monday or Tuesday, because chief of state, very simply explained them, what he intends to do for them and country. Similar informations are published by Reuters, Associated Press and other agencies. You decided? -I did. All of it? -All. Cile! What have you done? Nothing. I cut my hair. I'll never forget you. -Give me something to remember you. Give me your shirt. It has your smell. I had to come after my baker girl. I couldn't stand not a day, not an hour without her. Since she left, my heart was beating in the rhythm of her name. Crazy heart ceaselessly repeated: Jagodinka Simonovic, Jagodinka Simonovic, Jagodinka Simonovic... Dad, it's time for us to talk very seriously. For sixth time I'm prolonging your staying in the hospital. It's time to go back home. Here is real life. Here. Medical highschool is having practice here. Besides, maybe these are my last days. Dad. I cannot beg director of the hospital anymore. It's true that he's my friend, but you're going too far. You're healthy. -Me? -Sure. -And my back is hurting, my knees tremble, then bile, nerves? I am your father and it's your duty, to make director to do that. Besides you don't have to. I made him to play poker and he sucks. I will forgive him his debt if he doesn't threw me out. Chief of the hospital, 2 200 000. Highshool rector about 3 000 000. Highshool rector? -He also likes to play and he also sucks. I'll forgive him his debt if Perica passes the exam. What? You need money? Dad, I have big troubles. What is it? Talk. Perica is missing. What do you mean? -He fell in love with that Spasoje's fiancee and ran after her in Belgrade. I told Raka to find him. But nothing. I can't call the police, I would be ashamed. Him? Women? Petar!? That's my grandson! Where is he now so I can kiss him? That's not pedagogic. I scold him and you want to kiss him. How can I not kiss him? I was the same in his age! Dusko Mandic! Dusko! Just wanted to hear your voice! For unfortunate love and liberating death. Comrade, you're sitting on my wife's seat. I came after her, and she already have found some other clown. She forgot everything in two days. Tell him to stand up. -You see what state he's in? Tell him. -My wife doesn't have a place to seat. You have a ticket? -"L'amour est terrible." "La morte e bella." -Where is conducter? He's so sweet. Tadija! Czech are holding so well. That Dubichek is worth them like a gold. Dubchek. -How do you know? -I had a chance to exchange ideas with some philosophy students. Comrade judge, should we bring that band for wellcoming of president? Not a chance! We would be embareced. He's a gentleman, man of the world. Mila, check please! Let's go! You must be comrade Micic? - That's right. -Welcome. Wellcome? -A little county and patriarchal custom. It's suitable. After all, you're new president. I am Cvetkovic, local judge. My wife. I'm glad. -My daughter. My wife. And my younger son. That's my wife and my daughters. -What was your trip like? -Awful! Good at the start, but then some drunk noddy came in and started to vomit in the car. That's the youth of today. Please, car is waiting. -Thank you. Thanks collegue. I didn't expect something like this. If you need something, don't hesitate to ask. Take a look. Pittyful is the father that has a son like this. Sorry and pittyful. There was a meeting today betweeen Communist Party of SSSR and Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. As Agency Tass is saying meeting was full of total honesty, openess and mutual understanding and it was objected to develop more stronger of traditionally friendly relations of between Parties of two nations founded on the principals marxism, Leninism and proleterian internationalism. Both delegations... Why do we brush our teeth now? -Guests are coming. And what are we going to do to them? -Shut up and brush like crazy! For that embarassment, you will get detention. Dad, it's not a medeival. -Shut up you bastard. President of the court mustn't find out, that you were that raff from the train. Man who can't educate his own son, can't and mustn't be a judge! Veso! -I'm coming! And don't make a sound! Your roses are wonderful. -That's my work. Yes, your work. And who's watering them? You're watering them, but I give them a soul. Please, let me show you. I interbreed them, graft them. I know their every particular need. You see, this is Elvira, there is Simonida, then Teodora. And what's the lady's name? -Leposava. -Leposava. Here! This would be Leposava. Please, madam. Let me show you our house. Our local bicycle union is organizing duck hunting. I don't know why people are rushing so much. You know how many cars there is? 105 000. -And you're not for cars? While I'm live we're not going to buy that. This is old family vineyard. -Congratulations. You know what you live for. In this house we're drinking only top class drinks. Can we try that? -Of course. I have something special for us. Good old fashion of living. Peaceful, quiet, calm... I always say to my husband, that something like this has to exist somewhere. What are you doing here? -We're in a visit. You're so sweet! Let my sister go. It's two of us, we're stronger. Just go ahead. I haven't be scared of stronger than you. This wine is from 1928. Famous vintage. There's only this bottle left. Here you are. -Thank you. You're lucky. Home, family, peace, stability. Eh my collegue... I'm sorry. -Something's wrong with the wine? -No. What can be wrong here? This is paradise! I remembered my pain. It's not right, but still, even if we see each other for the first time, I'll relieve you my soul. Feel free. If I can help you with something. Go ahed. It's about my children. -Excuse me? -I practically run away here. To pluck them off from bad company. You're lucky to have such kids. Me? -You don't know what kind of troubles I had. Comrade president... -Don't comfot me, I haven't told you everything. I'm sorry, you're wonderful man. I have to complain to someone. And who can I complain to? -You didn't had problems. Tadija and Vladica are angels. -Now I will show you. Hand of steel is the cure. He's tide up. -Who? - My ex problem. My oldest son. Come on. Petar! I will kill you! I will kill him. I will kill you, Petar! Here are the photos that reminding us on those days, when the struggle for the foundations of the first sky-scrapers began. The most important thing at the start was to take the land from the river and swamp. On 800 hectare came 21 millions cubic of sands. All that work without help of engines, using only pickaxe and shovel. For two decades 20000 apartments was finished. There are schools, health centers, cinemas, shops, everything that 100 000 citizens need. So that's in a few words, yesterday, today and tomorrow of a New Belgrade. And that tomorow is beeing made by the hands of young workers. Dear viewers, good bye. Daddy. -Sorry my darling. I'm pensive. You don't know, Vladica, the troubles I'm in. If you didn't get the good grades, I wouldn't know what to do... Daddy, I want to read you something from my diary. Read it. After everything that happened, this turbulent and decisive year 1968. is promising that in the near future we're going to fulfil all our awakened hopes. Fully employment will be achived, we will not owe anyone, social differences will almost not exist, and our whole country will be flowered and beautifuly arangged garden, united community of nations and ethnic groups. What dead line to make for this? Five or six years? Daddy, you're crying. -I'm happy, my daughter. Happy, beacuse you pervade, feel, you know things. You, 15 years old, know more than that idiot of mine in his 18. First son! Come on, daddy. He'll pass the exam. Trust me. He promised me. -I don't know, my daughter. Maybe this year of '68 is good for a mankind but for me it's a disaster. Here come grandpa with Czech girls. -What grandpa? You're all insane! Vladica, please, go stop him! No, no. I will go! Your grandson is passing the exam and you're in a parade with those Czechs. This is too much. I came out to have some joy. This may be the last night of my life. That would be 1000th jubilant. -My darling. Everyone has to die sometime. We're all of flesh and blood. I will die first. -You won't. -I will. -No. Go and see if Petar is coming.. And I failed three times. So what then? I was best geometar in the whole county. You're still using my cadastres. And I spent 8 years filling and rearranging what you wrote. -You are my son. You had to make some contribution in life. Brother is coming! Brother is coming! Brother is coming! Brother is coming! - He's coming? But he hanged his nose down. -Hanged his nose down? Clear! He failed! Petar, grandpa's pride! Congratulations! -He's congrulating him. So, brother? -I passed. -Passed, of course! Mama, he passed the exam! -He passed beside my grave! Die, Veselin Cvetkovic! Die! My son! You passed. -He passed? I will remember this day, 20 of August, until I die. Your highschool rector's debt is now gone. And now, the two of us will merry until the dusk. This is your first big night. Your first big night. And maybe my last. Pera, Pera stop. Petar, how it's wonderful to live! I'm fed up with hospital, wheelchairs, spoons... My legs and my heat are still good. I want to live Petar! Grandpa! Look Petar, carp! Here you are, your carp. One litar of white wine. -Grandpa! -Grandpa's pride! Rumpus salad, sliced sheep cheese, chilli pappers. To remind ourselves of everything we used to love. Right away Mr. Cvetkovic. This is my older brother. Dance, Petar, make me proud. Ruzenka. -Petar. We must bring him back to life. A long time ago I was study in Prague with good soldier Svejk. Dance, Petar. Eh, how did we randan in my time! In Prague, on the Karlo's Bridge. Petrchek, wake up. Live. -No, I want to die. This may be the last night of my life. You're dancing with a dead man. Last salute. You only live once, Petar, remember that. Only once! If I could only live for another 10 years! And then I would retire. My blood. This is my tree. I call it a tree of life. How do you say tree? Tree? -Vrba. (Willow) It is a willow. I come here when something significant happened in my life. First grade, end of elementary school, first year of highschool, scarlet fever, grandma's death. I wanted to hang myself here once. Would you come one time in Prague? One time! Hundred times! That morning, like I premonited, finally I have found a woman of my life, Ruzenka Hrabalova. I've decided to give my Ruzenka, the most beautiful bouqet of roses from a father's garden. Simonida. Emilia. Leposava. Armed forces of SSSR, Democratic Republic of Germany, Poland, Hungaria and Bulgaria, in the night between Tuesday and Wednesday, ocuppied the whole territory of Czechoslovakia.. During the night Radio Prague announced that, forces of 5 states of Warsaw Pact are entering from all around on Czechosolovakian ground. Radio appealed on citizens to maintain peace and order. When did they gone? -Just now. That's how started and ended my first and great love that long gone year of 1968. I haven't seen Ruzenka Hrabalova ever again.
