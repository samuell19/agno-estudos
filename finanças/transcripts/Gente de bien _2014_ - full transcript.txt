[kids playing] I'm defending! Cuca! Cuca! Quick! Take this, you fag! Now for real. No letting go nor anything! Don't let it go! -kid: No letting go? -Gabriel: No letting go! Get it! Son of a... False alarm! That was false alarm! It was false alarm! It was false alarm. DECENT PEOPLE [child crying] man: Little girl... man: Could it be because you're leaving? woman: The iron, watch out. Hey, that bag. Oscar, I want to bring that bag. man: Are you leaving all this here? -Another bag? -Yeah, that one's black and... -woman: Calm down... -man: We're going, ok? -man: Leave the girl. -Go with your granny. Go. woman: I think we can bring everything. Bigger stuff first. -little girl: Dad! -woman: Your daddy's coming. [muttering] [dog whining] Get the dog, we're stopping here. mother: Take the dog. This way. Look, there's your dad. Good evening. Hey, Mr. Hedgehog, how you doing? They call you "The Hedgehog", right? Hey, Lupe! I've been waiting for half an hour, in this cold weather. That's too bad. I brought as much of the kid's stuff as I could. Two bundles and the dog, I couldn't carry anything else. There are still some books and toys back in the house. He can get them later. Ok, we'll see what Gabriel needs and we'll go get them. Sure, just call them and they'll give it to you there. You know. And here are his sheets, towels, all that. -Oh, good. -All his things. -Clothes and shoes in this bag. -Ok. And some more clothes in here. Gabriel: And when are you traveling? woman: Tomorrow, that's why I'm in a bit of a rush. Gabriel: Well then, best of luck. I hope it works out. I hope so. Bye, son. Take care, alright? -Be a good boy. -Yes, ma'am. You know this is as hard for us as it is for you. Okay? You know it. Be a good boy. Be good. Really good. -Bye, Gabriel. -Gabriel: All the best to you. Gabriel: Ok, let's go. It a long road ahead. We're almost there. About eight blocks left. Are you tired? Should we stop and get something to eat? I'm not hungry. -Huh? -I'm not hungry. Don't you want anything to drink? [indistinct voices] Put your bag down. Here's where I live. I'll make some space here so you can put your shirts, trousers... Your shoes too. A lot of stuff can fit in here. Do you know how your mom packed all this? -No. -No? Then let's take a look and check how she did. Socks... Do you miss your mom? I don't like this place. It'll only be for a couple of days. I knew you were coming, I've been looking for a different place. One more comfortable for the three of us. Alright? -Good morning. -man: Morning. We're coming to Mrs. Maria Isabel's apartment. -What's your name? -Gabriel Santamaría. -Get out of my room! -Get up! -No, you son of a bitch, get out of my room! -Get up! Don't shout at me! You stop shouting! You damn nutcase! Juana: Get out of my room! Maria Isabel: Juana, don't talk to me this way, you get up now. -Juana: I can't stand you! -Maria Isabel: I can't stand you either! Maria Isabel: And know what? Forget about your trip. -What's that? -Yeah, you're not going! We better start getting ready here. -Juana: Oh, just like that? -Maria Isabel: Yes, just like that. -No. -Yep, just like that. -I've been planning this for too long. -You don't say! What a joy! Maria Isabel: Anette, get breakfast for this little girl, she's going to school. -Hey Gabriel, how are you? -Gabriel: Good morning. -Is this your son? -Yes, ma'am. -Say hi. -Nice to meet you. I'm Eric Santamaría. -How are you doing, Eric? -Very well, ma'am. -Are you here to accompany your dad? -Yes, ma'am. I'll introduce you to my son, Francisco, so you can play with him, alright? -Okay. -Relax, go ahead. -So you haven't found anything? -Gabriel: No, not yet. -Maria Isabel: Well... -Gabriel: But I have three other quotes. Maria Isabel: Three quotes? Gabriel: I have several ones, but nothing gets confirmed. Now try this one on. I've been thinking that I should try to find you something permanent at the university. That's what you need. That'd be good, I actually need to move out of the house I'm in. -Did you take a T-shirt? -Yeah. -Maria Isabel: That one? -But Mom, I... I still wear that one. No, anyway... I don't like it, and it's too large for me. Maria Isabel: It looks great on you. Eric: No, I'm serious, it makes me look fat. Maria Isabel: What about sport shoes? Which ones are you not wearing anymore? The white ones. -Francisco: We have to go. -Maria Isabel: We'll go in a minute. My purse... Have you seen my purse? I'll give you some money, then I'll deduct it once you're done. -Well, I... -150. -Thanks. -Bye Eric! -Bye. -See you later. Bye. Watch it, be careful. There. -I know. -Open it up a bit. A bit. So how come you failed so much at school this past year? I don't get it. You've always been a good student. I dunno. But you were doing fine at midyear. Yeah, but that was at midyear. Tell me, we're going to spend quite some time together anyway. -No, but... -We have to talk about it at some point. A gift! Woooh! Chicago Bulls, one! Come on. My turn. -One. -Come on, my turn. It's my turn! You can't play like this! You know you're not getting it in! Come on, be serious! Can't you play normally? Is it too much for you? Nothing's too much for me, bitch! -Is that so? Is it? -Is this how you treat people? Then come on, you bastard! Get out of my room now! Get out! -I will when I fucking want to! -Get the fuck out of my room! Faggot! Maria Isabel: What happened? Gabriel: Can you explain what's going on? Nothing. If that's so, then what was all that ruckus about? Jeez, nothing's going on, ok? Nothing's going on? That kid, Francisco, he's an arrogant. But he can be how he pleases, can't you see this is his home? He's arrogant. Then tomorrow you better stay at home taking care of the place, because... All the better, I don't want to come back here. -This is boring. -Maria Isabel: What happened? Francisco was arrogant! Come here. -Apologize to him. -Why? Shake hands. Maria Isabel: Come on, apologize to each other. Make peace, ok? -Francisco: Why should I apologize to him? -Maria Isabel: Shake hands! -Maria Isabel: Come on. -Go. Shake his hand. Go. Maria Isabel: Come here, Eric. -Shake hands. -Why? -Because I say so. -But Mom... Like I'm telling you... This kid's here, we're on holiday, he's living at a place that's not his home. Alright? Please. Plus you're older than him. -Yeah, but... -Shake his hand! -Shake hands properly. -We already did! -No, do it right. Come on! -We did! Shake hands right. Come on, Eric. Done? Would you like to go to the movies? Why don't you go out for a while? [background chatter] Our turn. -Come on. -Alright, alright. Smile a bit. Done. You look great. Thanks. So cool. Which one should I post on Facebook? Which one of these? -This one, this, or this one? -None. Pick one. One, or the three of them! How much is it? -Too much. -We don't have enough, they're too big. I've already got one anyway. [indistinct chatter] Stop right there! Oh, I'm dead. Francisco: No, don't shoot at me. We'll play in a minute, not yet. -Give me your wallet. -Let me eat my ice cream! Your wallet. Put it here. I didn't bring it. Just let me borrow it once. Francisco: I am... Officer Francisco! [TV news] -That vest looks good on you! -Yes. You like it, huh? [rapping] Gabriel: Eric! What's the name of that song? "Your body calls me." [resumes singing] I don't really like reggaeton, but I do like some songs. Gabriel: And people dance that to? -Obviously. -Oh? Gabriel: Do you know how to dance to it? -Well, yeah. -Really? -Show me. -Uh... No, in a minute. -Huh? -In a minute! [singing] Gabriel: Oh, I don't know if I'll be able to do that. [Gabriel laughs] [singing continues] Trees all around. [dogs barking] Can you hear the dogs? They also guard this place. And the fresh air, the calm... This is very peaceful. Depends on the time you get here. It's not that peaceful in the morning. Berenice: This is where I live. Gabriel: What's that sound? Berenice: Birds. I've got birds. -Canaries? -That's right, they're canaries. -And who do you live with? -With my husband and daughter. Bernice: This is the apartment I'm renting out. -Luis: Look at this apartment. -Bernice: Fully furnished. You will live here like kings. -Thank you very much, ma'am. -Not at all. We're settled, I'll bring you the money next week. -Luis: Thank you. -Okay, Mr. Luis. -You're welcome. -Luis: See you soon. Come on, Eric. Come on, Lupe. Remind your dad, If he didn't like the place, he has to say so, so her father doesn't wait for nothing. I'm thinking about decorating my area of the room. I think I will decorate it with San Andreas, GTA 5 and Halo 3. -Um hmm. -And... And also about the TV, I'm thinking about getting an Atari, to play. Here's where your aunt lives. -Hi, Marta. -Hi, Gabriel, how are you doing? -Fine, you? -Welcome, so great to see you. -Thanks. -Come in. Oh my God! Look how big you are, Eric! You've grown a lot. I thought I wouldn't see you again. -Gabriel: Hi, how are you? -man: Good evening, take a seat. -Gabriel: Thanks. -Do you remember me? -The rest, how are they? -Gabriel: Fine enough, you know. -How's work? -Good, always something to do. Kids! Come on, sweetie, sit down. -Look how big Eric is. -man: Hi, Eric. -It's true he's gotten big. -Kids! [mutters in the distance] Carolina, Juan David, please come down here! -Carolina: Hello. -Gabriel: Hi. -Carolina: How are you? -Gabriel: Good. -Hi. How are you? -Fine. They've grown up a lot too. Marta: Quite a bit. Next time you come here, I'll make a juice, that I didn't make this time, but it's made of vegetables, and you won't know which vegetables is because... -man: Pumpkin. -Eric: Carrots. -No... -Eric: Ullama? Yes, but it tastes like vanilla. And... -Eric: No, that's horrible. -No. A friend invited me once to eat Bandeja Paisa. And I knew she was vegetarian, so I thought "Wow, she changed her mind." Alright? So once we get there, it turns out the Bandeja Paisa restaurant was a vegetarian restaurant. So they served me the so-called Bandeja Paisa, and it looked like a regular Bandeja Paisa, you know, chopped beaf, beans... What about the chorizo? The chorizo was probably some broad bean, I don't know, but it tasted like chorizo. -But it was delicious! -Indeed, delicious. I didn't say the contrary. The milk was soy milk... So besides the beans, they poured milk over it? Um... No, not milk... I... I don't quite remember... I don't remember what we talked about after dinner, but... And then half hour later... [imitates fart sounds] Gabriel: You're my sister, so... I know I'm your sister, but only when you need me. I'm sorry, I just need to borrow 400,000 pesos. Do you remember last time you were here? Do you? Yeah, I... And you've worked, you had money to pay me back. -I won't steal from you, Marta. -I know that. When somebody works and gets money, he should pay back what he owns. Gabriel: That's what you think, but I haven't cheated you. -But the time you were with the kid... -Alright. Don't worry, Marta. Don't worry about it. We'll just drop it and... Marta: Don't get angry, Gabriel. -No, I... -Look, Gabriel, I can help. You can come here, stay with the kid, live here for some time... No, I don't want to become a burden for you. You won't be any burden. Mom, could you give me a glass of soda? -Of course, love. You too? -And me? -Are you ok, kids? -Yes, fine. -Are you spending time together? -Yes, ma'am. That's good. Marta: Here you go. [TV chatter] [voices of people arguing] [noisy chattering] Gabriel: The prosthesis! -Here, boy. -Oh, good! man:...'cause Lucy had it there. man: I thought you were talking about Lucy. man: My dentures, man. It falls off. So Lucy had to suck gum. man: Get this sucker out of here, please. Could you serve them another round of beers? -waitress: Same one, right? -Yes, ma'am. -Who's this one on? -On him. Can I have a kinder egg? Get whatever you want. And a kinder egg, please. -Can you take these? -Yup. -Need help? -Nope. Here. This fag here says this one's mine. Brother, you shouldn't be the one bringing the beers. Why are you bringing these? Do you work here? Mrs. Carmen, how can you send the kid here with the beers? You have feet? You can get up and come here to get them. -man: It's a joke! -old man: No, I stand by this. waitress: Ok, then we leave it here, I give you the bill... -old man: No, no... -Not yet. Perfect. I'm giving you the bill. old man: This kid can't be in an establishment... Then why did you send him? old man: Tomorrow, when he gets busted... man: We have to be understanding, he's a senior citizen. -You know you can't... -He's a bit old. man: Alright, understood. old man: He just can't carry alcohol. [noise in the street] man: Alright, Dad. I understand. old man: Just to get your beers, you allow this to... Gabriel: Where's the dog? [people shouting nearby] [dog whining, people yelling] Eric: Lupe! -Hey, hold on! That one's mine! -Just a moment! -We have to take the dog. -No, you can't! No! man: It was in the middle of the street! It was just there, right in front of us! [people arguing] -Come on, let's negotiate! -No, sir. -But think about the boy, man! -No, no, the dog is coming. Eric... Let her use the computer, she has a paper to do. Come on, we have to go. Besides, I know how to do that. We'll get the dog out on Monday. -Okay? Let's walk. -Okay already! Calm down, both of you. Arguing won't solve anything. -Just let him finish. -Come on, Eric, let's go. Seriously, come here. Gabriel: The process takes eight days. We've got time, boy. I said no! -I told you we're going! -No! Okay, let's see if you know how to walk by yourself. Walk! -Come on, calm down now. -What's wrong with you? Be respectful! -Go away! Go away! -Go to your room! Be respectful, there's people sleeping here! woman: And you, please teach your boy to respect this. Gabriel: Don't tell me how to raise him. woman: Please start looking for some other place to go to. I'm already looking, alright! You think I like it here? With you bullying me all the time? Well, I hope it happens soon. I'm not giving you a deadline, but... How rude! Don't slam the door in my face. Savage! Maria Isabel: If we go down that alley I think... Gabriel: No, it's not this one, it's not here. It's down the other one. Maria Isabel: Because of the new naming, I'm not sure now if I got the correct address. 106 A. 106 A, that's correct. Still a little further. If we keep going in circles, we'll never get there, neither of us. Maria Isabel: 65 B... Gabriel: I think it's there. Gabriel: This is it. Maria Isabel: Yes, it's here. -Thank you. -Thank you, Mrs. Maria Isabel. -Call me if you need anything. -Bye. Don't waste time, or you'll be late for the meeting. Yes, of course. [dogs barking] -She's a white dog. -White? -Yes, she's... -A mutt. That's it, a mutt. There she is. She's a mutt. These are little ones. What is her size? Medium? Big? Medium size. Medium? What's her name? Lupe. She looks like that one, but bigger. -Which one? -That one. But bigger. [dog barks continue] And where are placed the dogs that have been brought recently? There's just these two areas. Gabriel: Look! Here she is! That's her! Lupe! -Gabriel: Hello, Lupe! -Eric: Lupe! -Can we take her out? -Up here, Lupe, jump! Lupe! -The ears. -And this side too. The chassis. Easy, little dog. When did you bathe her for the last time? Huh? When was it? There's still a bit here. -Oh, right. A lot. -A lot. Come on, come on. -Juana: Who did you go with? -girl: Mochis and Pablo. We slept at his aunt's. Juana: Really? Look! Look how he's spinning! -Juana: For how long? -girl: About two weeks. -Alright, your turn now. -Thanks. My turn! Give it to me! In a minute. After me! Even the teachers are tired, they go like "Get out!", see? Yeah, they make us leave class earlier and all. So cool. And by this time, they start threatening with exams. -Yeah. -Weird ones. I'm going to Australia on Monday. Why Australia? Um... All my dad's family is there, so I'm going to visit. -First time I'm going there. -The flight must be tiring. -Yeah, like 24 hours. -Juana: That's terrible. -What about stopovers? -girl: One in Los Angeles. Jeez. -girl: We have to go upwards before... -...going downwards again. -girl: Right. -Up and down. -boy: Where are you going, Juana? -I'm going to my ranch. -Where is it? -In Arbeláez. -We go every holiday. -girl: Is it cool? Not really. [girls laugh] Not that much. -girl: Can you bring Santiago? -No. -girl: Why's that? -Francisco: Mom said no. Because I argued with my mom. So then... Gabriel: I know I was wrong, but... wait for me to get the money, then we'll see what we can do. Meanwhile, we have to stay here for some time, I don't know for how long. We could borrow something from Maria Isabel. I don't want to borrow anything else from that woman. Eric: Why? I already owe her much, and I can't pay her back. If she lent you once, she'll lend you twice, I assure you. Gabriel: That's childish. -Eric: But... -It's our problem, not hers. You know I don't even want to live with you. -Oh, yeah? -Eric: Yeah. Well you will have to stick with me, 'cause your mother also wanted it this way. I don't care. I'm not staying with you. Gabriel: So what are you going to do? Are you going to live in El Cartucho or what? If I have to. So you like the street urchin life? -Eric: No, but... -Well then... -Eric: I prefer that. -Oh, you prefer that? Are you starving here? Are you freezing? What do you need? No, but you... What about me? You are... fine, it's alright. As you can see, I haven't gotten up. There must be some reason, then. -Um... Ma? -What? This... Tania Rodríguez didn't answer anything. Oh. Well, give her a zero, since she didn't answer a thing. Maria Isabel: One, two... three, four, five... Maria: Monochromes... How can they answer monochromes when it says chromatic analogies? -They don't even read the questions. -No. -I'm done. -Maria: You are? Yes. That was quick. -Can I go play with the Wii? -Just a minute. Can I play with the Wii? Go stupefy yourself with the Wii, okay. He did correct them fine. Incredible. [sound of Gabriel sanding wood] [Wii booting up] [video game music] Is that what you are? A thief? Do you go to people's houses to steal? No. Maria Isabel: So? Why did you take that money? Answer me, Eric! I'll talk to your dad. Should I talk to your dad? No. Should I tell him what you just did? Answer me! We're getting kicked out of the house we're living in. You think your father would accept this money? What would you do with it? I'm sorry. So you think being sorry solves everything? No, sir. What should I do now? I can't trust you anymore, what should I do? Sorry. Do I have to stay around to make sure you don't steal anything else? I forgive you, but that's not... that's not the issue here. Maria Isabel: Oh, God... I'll talk to your dad to see what can be done about his rent. But that's a grownups' problem, it doesn't concern you. Yes, ma'am. That boy, stuck in that boarding house all day long. Not doing anything. Hating the place he's living in. I appreciate this, but you should spend time with your family in December. Maria Isabel: And I will. I know this is not ideal. Maria Isabel: But this is a complex situation, don't you think? And given this opportunity, and not having anything else to do... Besides, if you come repair some furniture there, that means more money for you. And Eric can enjoy some quiet holidays. Maria Isabel: It's not a gift, you'd be coming to work, don't play noble. If you have a towel, get it too. Uh-huh. What's that for? It's a present for Maria Isabel. It'd be better to not bring anything at all. It's the thought that counts. [wind blowing] Juana: You're just doing this to annoy me. Francisco: Mom, she hit me. Juana: I didn't, I... Francisco, stop it. Seriously. Maria Isabel: Please, don't get started again. Gabriel: Eric, sit down properly. Hey, sit properly. Maria Isabel: It's alright, he's not doing anything wrong. Francisco: You used to tell me it was dangerous. Maria Isabel: It is, but he's not sticking his head out too much. Gabriel, please give me a hand. Open the door, it's probably unlocked already. -Do I need a key? -No. -Thanks! -Gabriel: No problem. Juana: The lights are on. [honking sounds] Maria Isabel: Hello there! gardener: Hi! kids: Hi! Hello! Gabriel: I'll help you unload the bags. Look, there's Juana. -Hello! -Hi! We almost didn't make it! -Hello. -So good you came! -How you doing? -Stop it. [chatter] Alright, grab your things! Juana! man: Go ahead. man: I want to see that. Start settling in! -Eric. -How do you do? -man: What's the name of the dog? -Lupe. Maria Isabel: Hey, love! Where's José? -How do you do? -Good afternoon, how are you? -How you doing? -I'm Gabriel. -man: Please come in, Gabriel. -Thank you, very kind. Maria Isabel: Gabriel will stay here with us during holidays. Maria Isabel: Keep walking and we'll settle in. woman: But we've prepared it so he stays in that house. Maria Isabel: At Jose's? man: Yes. Maria Isabel: Do you want to put him up there? woman: Yes. Him, and the boy and the dog too. -woman: You can stay there. -man: You can set up the place as you want. Okay, let's go. [birds chirping] Oh, they already made a bed so you can settle in. José: Yes, ma'am. They can settle in here. Do you think the dog can stay here with them? I think so, I don't see any inconvenience. Maria Isabel: Okay, José, thanks. -I'll see you in a minute. -We'll be down soon. Bye. Would you like to take a shower? I sure am taking one. -Maybe I will. -Huh? Maybe. Hail Mary, full of grace. Our Lord is with you. Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus. all: Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. all: As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen. woman: Joys. Oh, Wisdom, from the sovereign God, that a childish reach you have lowered. O Divine Child, come to teach us prudence, that makes truly wise men. all: Come! Come! Come to our souls, Jesus! Come! Come to our souls, Jesus! Come! Come do not delay! Come! Oh, King of the nations, Emmanuel illustrious, from Israel yearning, you are Shepherd of the flock. Child who grace with soft arch the surly sheep and the meek lamb. all: Come! Come! Come to our souls, Jesus! Come! Come to our souls, Jesus! Come! Come do not delay! Come! From weakened relief and suffered under, you are comfort for the sad and light the exiled. Life of my life, my beloved owner, my unfailing friend, my divine brother. [chatter] Francisco: Santi! You have it here, alright? Santi: Okay, thanks! Francisco: I've got two. I've got three! -Francisco: How many? -Three. Francisco: Who're they from? From Juana, Francisco and Maria Isabel. I think something got his attention now. He's been a witness the whole morning. -girl: You too? -No, I'm okay. Thanks. He's happy, isn't he? Yeah. He's with the rest of the boys. It's good you came. Eric will enjoy Christmas. So where did your mom live? We live downtown. In a really cool area, La Candelaria. That's cool. Where's that? La Candelaria? Eric: Downtown. [people chatting] [boys talking] Eric... Let me know when you're done eating, so we can go to sleep. No... I want to sleep in the tent tonight. Gabriel: Which tent? In that one. And you boys are going there under the rain? Eric: No, perhaps here. Francisco: It always rains. It does? And Maria Isabel gave me her permission. Alright, I'll bring your pajamas so you can sleep comfortably. Eric: No need, we'll stay inside anyway. Okay. See you tomorrow, boys. -G'night! -Good night, Gabriel! "Good night, Gabriel"? He's your dad! I know. Why you call him Gabriel, then? I like to call him by his name. -See you tomorrow. Rest well. -See you! Then I go like "Wah"! I got into something that'll never end! I will finish it! Yum! You strip off her tongue. He strips off a bit of her tongue. boy: She was like this. Oh! And this guy is about to die, people! He's gonna die. She wanted it a lot, so she's like... And I was like "I got myself into something that won't end!" But well, gotta enjoy it! This doesn't usually happen! So I started to enjoy it, and I also went like... Gross! [birds] [dog pants heavily] What's wrong? -Good morning. -Good morning. Could I borrow some old newspaper or something? The dog pissed on the floor overnight. José: Yes, sir. Baby! Can you give him some newspaper, and a rag? For the dog. woman: Yes, sir. [chatter nearby] Good morning. Could I talk to you for a minute? -What is it about? -I need to tell you something. I don't think I'll be finishing the job. Why? What happened? I don't even understand what I'm doing here. You're repairing furniture, Gabriel, what else? I know, but... You can have those repaired in January, February, anytime. And Eric and I... I think we're not... So you're a wealthy man? If you refuse this job, how are you going to live? I'm offering you this so you can rest assured. Some other time, then. I'm sorry to leave those unfinished, but... -But... -Did something happen? Nothing in particular, but... But I feel we shouldn't be here. So what are you going to do? I already made the decision. In a while we... And how will you leave, Gabriel? I got enough for the ticket. How will you feed him? You're taking him to make him suffer. Whoa! woman: Boys! Come to take your shower, it's late! We're coming! woman: Come on, we have to go to town soon! Wait up. He's driving now. Go. How do you accelerate? You brake with this one, and accelerate with that one. Jeez. Francisco: A bit more. Francisco: That's not the brake! boy: What are you doing? [passengers chatting] woman: We gotta to see this. man: Yeah. -Good afternoon. -Good afternoon, at your service. -What would you like? -Eric: I dunno, a juice. -A juice and a bottle of water. -Yes, sir. Gabriel: Thanks. We could drink this on the road, so we get to the parade. We'll go in a minute. How'd you like this trip? Cool. -Huh? -It was cool. Maria Isabel's ranch was nice, wasn't it? -Uh-huh. -Really nice. I have to go to Bogotá. I have a job to do there. Gabriel: I'll earn some good money, it looks good. How's that? I'll go repair some furniture in a restaurant. Gabriel: I talked to Maria Isabel already. Gabriel: So you can stay over with them during these holidays. What happened to your job for Marisa? Gabriel: That can wait. It can be done on January or February. She also offered to... to take care of you for a while, while I get back on my feet... economically, or until your mom can take care of you again. Gabriel: She'll get you everything you need. What about the dog? I'll take the dog, and... she'll be with me. The dog in Maria Isabel's apartment... would be a pain, don't you think? -Good afternoon. -You made it! -Hi. -I thought you'd get lost. Oh, yes, it's easy to get here. -So? -Yes, I'm going. I'm ready. I just need to go get the dog. So are you staying with me? -Yes, ma'am. -And are you happy? Okay. Be a good boy, do as she says. -Alright? -Yes, sir. I'll call you as soon as we get back to Bogotá, so you can talk to him. Thank you for everything. -I will call you. -Ok. Well, say bye to your dad. Good bye. -boy: Bye, Gabriel. -Bye. Francisco! -Have you ever ridden a horse? -No. Pancho, come here. Maria Isabel: Look, Eric's here. Maria Isabel: You can teach him to ride. Which horse should we give him? Which horse will you be riding on? Eric: I like this one. -I'll go with that one. -That one? -Francisco: That one. -Okay. -Maria Isabel: Doing okay? -Uh-huh. Try to make him turn around, so you start learning. Now that way. That's right, very good. He can walk on his own. Look. Hit him with the spurs on the belly so he starts walking. Alright? Come on. [horses galloping] This one's beautiful. -This one? -Juana's. Look. Right on! [Band playing "My Way"] Take this. We'll now ask José to air out the mattress and that's it. -No problem at all, ok? -Yes, ma'am. But making sure nobody notices. Don't worry, I'll ask him to air it in the afternoon. Don't worry about that, I'll have it cleaned now. Relax. Nothing's wrong, boy. This can happen to anybody. Do you have everything you need? -Yes, ma'am. -A towel, everything? Alright. Come have breakfast once your done. Francisco: Hi, mom. Everything fine? Yeah. Good morning! [singing] [laughing] -Cheers! -Bravo! man: Cheers, Juanita. woman: Here's to the sorrow of not having Santiago here. old woman: Here's to you understanding that cigarettes are good! If you stop smoking, you get... Maria Isabel: Don't believe a word! Hey, they've got to have something good. boy: That's some bad example! old woman: You're the ones giving bad example everyday. A toast to... cigarettes rotting in the trash! Cheers! -Cheers! -Let's have fun! A toast to Christmas, to presents! A man opens the door of his house. He takes the keys. He shuts the lights. Maria Isabel: How can he open the door if he... He opens the door. He gets the keys. He shuts the lights. He goes out. He closes the door. After walking down some blocks, he realizes he just made a mistake for a lot of people. Which one was it? -boy: The sea is a great clue! -And... boy: It's the key. boy 2: It's got relation with the sea? -It's fundamental. -The sea... I don't know! Tell me, what is it? boys: No! boy: I'll give you the answer, because... -Yeah, no, tell us. -Yeah, tell us what it is. It's too difficult. boy: He lived in a lighthouse! -A lighthouse! He lived there! -Oh, right! man: What? What's that? Maria Isabel: You've got some great stories! boy: Okay... I'll tell one too. What does a gate say to another gate? "Hey, you're weird. What did they do to you?" "Nothing, they just didn't put any lock on me." [all laughing] -Eric: My turn! -woman: That last one was a bit weird! woman: I didn't get it. -I'll tell four. -everyone: No! man: Just let him, it'll be fine. boy: One. Tops! Maria Isabel: Come on, go ahead. The first one. Down a little short road, walks a scowling creature which name you already know. Which is? -Richard? -No! Where did you get that from? Eric: Somebody try finding it! -man: A man? -woman: A scowling creature? -Eric: Don't you know how to decipher codes? -man: No... -man: Tell it again. -Maria Isabel: Yeah, tell it again. Down a little short road, walks a scowling creature which name you already know. Which is? The cow! -Oh! -The cow! Down a little short road, walks a scowling creature. Cow! everyone: Oh! Okay! [applause] Do you realize I'm not the only one thinking this? Everyone, your whole family, is thinking the same way. I don't care what everyone else thinks. But... no. This can't be. What can't be? You can't bring this kid home. -Maria Isabel: Why not? -'Cause it's not right. We simply cannot live with a stranger like this... all of a sudden. -Oh, so terrible! -Juana: Can't you see? -What should I see? -Juana: We don't know this kid! We do know him! No, personally, I don't. And you don't either, so stop lying. This is about helping somebody who needs it, try to put yourself in his place. -Why can't you listen to my opinion? -I am listening! -I just don't find it interesting! -This isn't right! I'll do this because I think it's correct, it's fair, and I'd like you on my side, not on everyone else's. Well then, let's do something. Why don't we start helping all the poor children around the world? You know what? This decision's been made. I don't want to talk about this anymore. The decision's made. And this is my home! I'll do as I please! I won't be leaving with a stranger, I won't accept this. -Maria Isabel: Oh, you won't? -Francisco won't either. Maria Isabel: No? Then what will we do? I'm leaving. -Oh? You're leaving the house? -Juana: Yeah! Where to? [crickets and birds] I was the second best! I was the second best. Nine... and ten. Eleven. Twelve. Thirteen! Francisco: Here! Nice one. Enough! Eric, stop it! It's his fault! Just stay put. Hey, don't hit me. boy: Stop bugging! Why should I? Shove off! Get lost, prick! -Or else what? -"Or else what". -You stop it right there. -boy: You do too. Francisco: Stop pissing off! Seriously. Enough. Like this. The three of us. One, two, three. Come on! [boys chatting] Fag! Asshole! [boys yelling and laughing] Let's play. Let's do a handstand. Oink oink. You just missed the oink. Oink! And the kiss! But you can't do that. man: Hit. woman: Next card, you deal it face down. woman: I've got 20 here. I stand. woman: That one I want it face down here. You've got 21 there. [people chatting] Did you fall asleep? Look dear, I made you a sandwich. Don't you want to eat? Aren't you hungry? Umm, nnn. So what do you want? Do you want to go to sleep without having supper? Eric... -Eric! -Enough, leave me alone! What's wrong with you? What did I do to you? You haven't done anything, let me be. Ok, then let's go to sleep already, come on, get up. You can't stay here all night! Come. -Enough already! -No. Can you look at me for a second? It's ok. It's over. The fight is over. Tomorrow's Christmas. Tomorrow there'll be presents. -Eat something. It'll make you feel better. -Knock it off! Since you don't want to eat, what is it you want? What do you want? I want to go home. But you can't. We agreed you'd be staying with me. Eric: Yes, but... I don't want to. -Let's see. Here, get up. -No! Knock it off! What's this rudeness? What is it you have with me? What's this nonsense about? Ok, let's go. To the bed. Eric: Bitch. Leave me alone, idiot. Do me a favor, and go to sleep already. -Are you my mom? -Shut up! Now go to bed. Go to sleep! -woman: What is this? -woman: What happened? Eric: Bitch. Go to sleep right now! [crickets, people whispering] It's your mom. Go talk to her. I'd better wait for a moment, I'll go once she's calm. -Are you okay? -Maria Isabel: Yes. Francisco: What happened? Mom, you okay? It's okay, just keep playing. [door opening and closing] Maria Isabel: I know it's around here, but not exactly where. Can you tell me where do you live, Eric? Maria Isabel: Eric? It's further ahead. Don't you say goodbye? -Gabriel: Good evening. -How's it going, Gabriel? I'm sorry, but I couldn't do anything. I couldn't calm him down. It's not your fault, after all. Are you going back to Arbeláez? No, I'll stay at home, I'll go back tomorrow morning. Those are two presents for Eric that I forgot to give him. So you can give them to him. See you later, and merry Christmas. Same to you. I wish you well. Gabriel: Did you eat yet? Yes. -Huh? -Yes. What's wrong with the dog? Looks like some kind of illness, she's not well. What happened with those boys back at the ranch? You don't want to talk? We better go to sleep then. Tomorrow's another day. Eric: What happened? Gabriel: Lupe's still very ill. [dog whining] -Come on. -Eric: Get up, Lupe. Gabriel: Come on, you'll get better. Bring her water. vet: Little Lupe. Okay, relax. Now let's see if she can stand. And... I know, dear. Please, give me a hand. Thanks. Okay, after examination, I've found several dysfunctions. But the most important one would be this. All the dog's lymph nodes are bigger than they should be. Isn't that an infection? No, not when it's widespread, not when it's all of them. That implies something different. Besides, when palpating her abdomen, there's a mass. I'd say she has a canine lymphoma. That's a tumor. vet: Some type of cancer, to be more specific. Thus the cough, the difficulty walking... In order to confirm it, I'd have to run some tests. X-ray, cytology, blood tests, scan... to see if these lymph nodes are what I told you or not. And how much do all these tests cost, doctor? All of them, about 200 or 250,000 pesos. Then we can proceed with... All of it, just to tell me she's got cancer? Yes, but then I'll be able to offer some treatment. vet: If it is cancer, one possibility is chemotherapy. On the other hand, looking at her, based on my experience, there's little we can do. Then let me speak with my son for a minute, so we can make a decision. vet: Alright. We'll do whatever you decide. -Thank you very much. -Very well, sir. Easy, little one... I don't want the dog to die either, but... No way. If I had the money to pay the treatment for that little animal... But it won't even save her. Do you forgive me? [razor buzzing] Goodbye, Lupe. You were a great dog. Gabriel: Thanks for being a good little dog. vet: What we'll do is that we'll apply the product, intravenously of course. That will depress her breathing, and her heart will stop beating. It won't hurt her. She won't feel anything. [both crying] [sad music]
