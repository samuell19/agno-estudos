José, Candela will be yours. Okay. What do you say? - Let's seal the pact. - May it be for the best. To our children. Love is just like the will-d-the-wisp Love is just like the will-d-the-wisp Flee from it and it pursues you Call out to it and it runs away Love is just like the will-d-the-wisp Cursed are those dark eyes that chanced to see it Cursed is the sad heart that sought to burn in its flame Just like the will-of the-wisp Love too fades away Carmelo!

Dance, José! Carmelo, you dance! Let's have the grandmothers dance! What do you want from me I'm losing ground Nothing surprises me when you're around You want to see me suffer I'm not that kind of girl There are lots of other pretty faces in this world When you leave tomorrow I'll miss you every day Though I know you only came to steal my brown sugar away Steal it away Steal it away I know you only came to steal my brown sugar away What do you want? I want to talk to you. We have nothing more to discuss. You're lovelier than ever, Lucia. I'd like to... Son of a bitch! Go find your wife and leave me alone! I'll be back for you. - Good luck to you, Candela. - Thank you. They're leaving! Come on! I think we lost 'em. Come on. Because the Virgin is a gypsy She's dear to their heart Because San José is spoiled He rebels and rebels I got my way and left you for another The Virgin leads the young child by the hand Glory to the mother And the newborn child If you bring money the whole house is yours If not, you'll have no place to stay The Virgin washes diapers And hangs them on the rosemary bush The little birds are singing And the rosemary is blooming I don't know what this feeling is Or what's happening to me When I yearn for that cursed gypsy Candela, you're burning Hell bums no hotter than my blood Afire with jealousy When the river roars what's it trying to say He loves another and has forgotten me When the fire bums when the river roars If the water doesn't put out the fire This suffering will haunt me This love will poison me These sorrows will kill me - Dance with me. - I'm dancing with him. - Come on. Don't be like that. - Okay, okay. She only dances with me. - Is she your bride too? - That's enough. You have the manners of a dog! Go to hell! The cops! Run! Come on! José, wake up! Come back! FOUR YEARS LATER José, wake up. Come back. José, come back. Let's go, Papa! Come on. Are you all right, son? - Yes, Papa. Let's get to work. Lobe! Carmelo! Great to see you! When did you get out? - Yesterday. Look! - You look good. A bit thinner. - And older. Like all of us. Not as much as me. Come along with us. Let's go! - Aunt Rosario. - You're finally out. I'm so glad. They got tired of me and tossed me out. I'm so happy- We missed you a lot. No one really missed me. We forget about other people. That's how life is. I lost four years of my life! You'll get them back! Start over now, with no grudges. Good-bye, Aunt. What's Candela been up to? Ever since José died... let me tell you: She's been under some kind of spell. Every night she goes to the spot where Jose died and talks to him. That woman! He was cheating on her all along, while she thought only of him. Everyone knew he was seeing Lucia. Do you still love her? With all the women around! I don't know what you see in that wallflower. - You know who's back? - Who? - Carmelo who? - Who do you think? How is he? A bit worse for wear, but he looks good. Candela, here he comes. And your gaze Pierces my eyes Like a sword How are you? Fine. And you? Better now. It's been a long time. Will we see each other later? A woman deceived Turns into a wild beast Don't try to caress her Or even go near her Don't try to caress her Just let the storm pass If I cursed you now If I cursed you now It would be like cursing The hour I was born I can't go on suffering like this I'd rather die Forget her, Carmelo. Forget her? José, wake up. Come back. She's mad! I told you. She comes here every night to find him. Careful! Keep back or they can cut your face! Come at me. That's it. Attack me with all you've got! Now you come at me. No, not like that! Right here! You try it with him. Get your hand out of your pocket! You come fight me! Attack me! Listen, steer clear of Manuela. Don't go out with José. He belongs to her. That's my business. Cousin Rocio... when's the wedding? Next month. Next month? Next month! Lucky girl, getting married next month! So you're getting married next month Getting married to Jacinta What a lucky girl He's the nicest, the best-looking, and the manliest. The nicest, the best-looking, and the manliest? He's not that great, girl. How would you know? What about you? How would you know? Could it be... you've tried the wares? What do men want from women? I don't know. Do you know, Candela? Me? I don't know! Do any of you girls know what men want What do men Want from women I know what men want! What's that? What they want is a nice warm place for their little birdy. Like a nest? Like a nest! My nest is on fire and can't find a little birdy Take my cage If a birdy enters it'll never escape Have you seen my brother? Yes. It's great that he's back. You must be happy. He's in love with you. Always has been, ever since we were kids. Did you know your husband had lots of other women? Really? So you didn't know that Lucia was one of them? Hello, Carmelo. How's it feel to be free? I'm still not used to it. I want to do so much that I end up doing nothing. When can I see you? Aren't you seeing me now? I can't stop thinking of you. Why me? You know why. I love you, Candela. - I'm going now. - Wait. - It can't ever be. - Why? You're free now. I'm more bound than ever now. Who's binding you, Candela? José is dead and I'm alive, and I love you! It just can't be. You were cheating on me the whole time! Were you seeing Lucia? Tell me! Did you love her? Tell me! Candela, it's me! My darling Candela! I love you! Leave me alone! I love you! Leave me alone! I don't know What this feeling is or what's happening to me When I yearn for that cursed gypsy Candela, you're burning Hell bums no hotter than my blood Afire with jealousy When the river roars what's it trying to say He loves another and has forgotten me When the fire bums when the river roars If the water doesn't put out the fire This suffering will haunt me This love will poison me These sorrows will kill me The cops! Run! Come on! He's calling me. But I don't want to go! He's chasing me. I'm too weak. What can I do? Calm down. What can I do, Carmelo? Let's leave this place. And go where? Anywhere far from here. He'll follow us everywhere, to the ends of the earth. What can I do? - Lobo. - What's up, Carmelo? Where are we going? Just come along. I was expecting you two. There's only one thing to keep the dead from returning: fire! Lucia still loves José. She was his lover in life. Let her be his lover in death too. What do you mean? Didn't José die defending her honor? If he died for her, it's fitting that she should offer him her love. Her love? You mean her life. My son... the happiness of some always comes at the expense of others. That's how life is. You must speak to Lucia. Tell her to go tonight to where Jose died, where Candela meets the apparition. Talk to Candela. Arrange it with her. There's no other way? You love Candela, don't you? Talk to Lucia. Convince her. - It doesn't feel right. - Let's try this. Hi, Carmelo. What do you think? So-so. Listen to him. Then why don't you teach me? Stand like this and lift your knee higher. Accent it. Wait. Make the first part softer, the second part stronger. Accent it more. It's always her, that little hypocrite! What do you see in Candela? What's she have that I don't? Aren't I prettier? Don't I have a nicer body? Caress me. Did you think of me in jail? As much as you thought of me. What would you know? Who are you trying to kid? You were crazy about José. I can't live on memories like Candela. I forget easily. You loved José. He gave his life for you. The day José died... a part of me died with him. I've never loved anyone as much. Ever. If you want, you can be with him again. José is dead! - You want to see him? - How? Like Candela? That's right. If she can see him, why not you? Just go at night to the spot where he died. We'll go together. I'll go with you. Are you serious? I don't believe in such things, but I've got nothing to lose. Tonight? Tonight. Put these on. Want me to go with you? No, this is for me and Carmelo to do. There's nothing you can do. I know. Wish me luck. I hope everything goes well. Thank you, Lucia. José, wake up. Come back. You're that evil gypsy That a gypsy girl once loved The love she gave you You didn't deserve Who'd have thought You'd betray her for another I'm the voice Of your destiny I'm the fire in which you burn The wind that hears your sighs The sea in which your ship runs aground The new day is breaking Sing out, bells, sing out For my glory has returned Subtitles by SUBTEXT SUBTITLING
