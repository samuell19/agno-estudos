BASED ON A SHORT STORY BY ÉMILE ZOLA Look! Look, it's Julien, the post office employee. Hey, Julien! Are you interested in women's laundry? It's time to educate yourself! Come here! Let us show you... The devil, he saw the devil! Don't run! He'll always be faster than you! Did you fall? Did you hurt yourself? No, it's the castle's carriage. I don't like horses. We whip them and blind them so they crush everything. It's said that dogs end up looking like their masters, horses are also like the men who lead them. - -Men are mean. - - Some are born that way. - -Give me some matches. - - You buy me matches every day. Keep the change. You're a good man, Julien. Oh! It makes me feel rich. Here's the most handsome one! Always well combed, Julien! - -Hi, Don Juan! - - Waiter! Two out of six, white on white. I won. Sit down, pretty mailman, I won't eat you. Hello, Ernest. Nice work. Your mermaid is pretty. A wooden woman! How peculiar I wonder what it can be used for. Fortunately, there are others such as Nana... Nana, what are you waiting for to seduce this Apollo? I can't do anything. His friend is mute, but he must be blind! Julien is afraid of women, aren't you Julien? They're nice, if you know how to speak. How handsome you are, Mr. Colombel! The lady of the castle has arrived. - -It shows. - - I'm having dinner at the De Marsanne's. A small ball in honor of Thérèse who's back from the convent. You should take Julien to see the upper class. I can't! Julien is busy in the evening, he works in the field. As a scarecrow! - -Good evening. - - You're back early, Julien. It's strange for your age. Says you. Always cooped up! Behind the post office counter by day. Upstairs in the room you rent by night. You'll grow mushrooms if you don't get some fresh air. You know, to me, being alone is a blessing. I'd live in a hole if I could. There would always be a reason to leave it. - -Love. - - Love... You can always find the right person, trust me. Hello, father dearest! Oh, you're not supposed to be here, you rascal! Don't forget that you're the son of a servant. - -Go back to the kitchen. - - Leave him be, Valentin. Sometimes the rule is to not follow the rules. - -Baroness... - - Don't be nobler than me. Thérèse came back from the convent, your son wants to see her. They grew up together! I understand that you're jealous. - -Hello, my boy. - - My respects, Baroness. - -How are you doing? - - I'm in pain. My kidneys are bad, my heart is failing. I don't feel very well. Have you come to admire our beloved girl? Wait for her, she will come down. PARISIAN LIFE Thérèse! Thérèse! Thérèse, Colombel is downstairs. He wants to say hello. Be nice to him. He helped take the Bastille. DAMSEL'S JOURNAL I'm glad you have smart reading material. In these times of republic and easy life, youth must preserve itself. - -Are you ready? - - I'll put on my ribbon and come down. You see, I became stylish. Coquetry is a sin. But it takes sins to make a world. And to make a woman. So, Francoise, what do you think of her now? She's a real little lady now. Miss Thérèse, a lady? She looks more like an angel. You make no sense, but thank you. Hello, Pierre. Good evening, Miss Thérèse. You're elegant. What are you up to? I'm the third clerk at Master Savournin's, and I'll maybe go to Paris soon. What about you? - -Glad to have left the convent? - - Yes, I'm very glad. You'll soon forget it. One does not forget such things. She became smart. I was the same. She'll be like me. Go and tell the colonel that we're waiting for him. He must be covering himself with glory in his room. Onward! Boldness, always boldness. Have the whole artillery fired! What is it now? Excuse me, colonel, the ladies are asking for you. At the moment when the Austrian cavalry is going to impale itself on the bayonets of my infantry! What would Napoleon have said if ladies had asked for him on the evening of Austerlitz? Do you know what he would have said? - -No, I don't know. - - I don't know either. My young friend, women were the end of Alexander, Caesar, the end of Tristan, Samson, Bonaparte. And when there's no one left alive, they kill time. What's it all about? - -Dinner, I guess. - - Dinner? It's the only psychological moment of the word. Let's have dinner. Tell me, my little Colombel, how do I look? You look great. You look younger. It took me a while. She's an angel. She looks like she came down from a stained glass window. I hope she never gets as low as you. What do you mean? Meaning, Ludobert, that you behave like a wine bag. Anaïs, in Cognac, there's an aristocracy of drunkenness. You'll end up completely demolishing your liver. No, don't try to scare me. I have a little illness that keeps me in excellent health. I don't blame you for eating too much. What do you mean? One-third of what you eat would be enough to sustain you. What are the other two-thirds for? To keep the doctors alive. Look at this. If you were still a colonel, you would be arrested. If Master Savournin gives me my raise... It's enough for tonight. Go through the service entrance. Mr. Butler, your descendant greets you. Despite all your big words, you're weak. Neutral, don't mix it up. Why didn't you mention her marriage? I didn't want to ruin the joy of his return. You know that it's wise to marry Thérèse. She doesn't get married, you marry her. Françoise, can you hear the music? The shoemaker's tenant thinks he's an artist. Good morning, Mr. Fordessus. Are you here to hire our national flutist? My budget does not allow for this luxury. - -Ten cents. Where are you off to? - - Oh, tell me about it! I have to withdraw 100 francs from my savings account. Yes, 100 francs. Small purchases, sending flowers to thank the baroness for her dinner. This dinner was absolutely lovely. - -Hurry up, I'm in a rush. - - Sign here. Telegraph, excuse me. This is crazy. I don't have time to waste. WILL ARRIVE AT 2:20. RESPECTFUL TRIBUTES, VETEUIL. Here you are. There will be other flowers in the castle, and more beautiful than yours. - -What is it? - - A telegram, Baron. Slide it under the door! I can't, sir, it's on a tray. As requested by the Baroness. - -Hey! Véteuil is coming. - - Oh! I'll tell Thérèse the good news. Thérèse! Thérèse! Thérèse! Thérèse, wake up! You sleep too much. Tell me, Thérèse. - -Do you remember the Marquis De Véteuil? - - The old fool? A man with three castles and a mansion in Paris is never completely a fool. What do they teach you at the convent? The marquis has a son and we're waiting for his visit. He's charming. We love him very much. - -Do you know what I mean? - - No. You may be an angel, but not nearly so much. Since you need more details, we would like our family tree to join that of the Véteuil. Ask the gardener. Don't be silly, let's talk seriously. - -Mister De Véteuil... - - But! What's wrong with you, Mom? Your face looks like it's all puffy. - -Puffy? - - Yes. Oh, how awful! These mirrors make you ugly in the morning! You're not bringing your whips? - -To get married? Don't be silly. - - You're an optimist. Well, too bad for you. Men only get what they deserve. Others remain single. So kind of you to encourage me. How do you like your little Henri? You look stupid like the prize-winning steer in the agricultural competition. Thank you. You chose a strange day to be jealous. It's just a bad time to get through. The slaughterhouse isn't far. You definitely have a lot of jealousy. Jealous, me? Jealous of whom? Of your unsightly provincial woman? Mademoiselle is wrong to be angry. She forgets that marriage is the only life sentence from which one can be freed by one's bad behavior. Should I understand that I'll continue to be your bad behavior? You mean you'll become it. Until now you were only my girlfriend, a subordinate and banal position. From now on, you'll be a mistress. That's progress. Aren't there days when you get disgusted? Oh, you know, I'm all about forgiveness. Is it normal to marry a girl you don't love? I'm well-mannered enough to give her the impression that I do. That's what matters. And we're the ones called courtesans... Why are you getting married? That's just how it is. Traditions, my dear, traditions. I see. So, you marry by heredity like others have rheumatism. Exactly. In more refined terms, we say, "nobility obliges". Maximin, bring down my luggage. See you soon, my spring. You'll receive something from my jeweler tomorrow to mark this day. No! - -What is it? - - A white stone, of course. Traditions. Always traditions. Vézilly! Vézilly! - -My dear Véteuil! - - My dear baron! The car is there. Tell me, my friend, did you have a good trip? During the first part of the trip, I was a bit bored. - -In your company? Is it possible? - - Indeed, it's strange. - -Then I was no longer alone. - - You met someone? - -Oh no, I was dreaming. - - How nice. It may seem surprising to you, you don't know Semandrilla. You've never seen her run? No. You were dreaming about a mare! She won the Grand Prix de Diane. An important day in a man's life. - -It all depends on the man. - - What's the news? Oh my God, not much. Although... I've beaten Napoleon at Austerlitz. Excuse me. They say he came for the girl of the castle. Maître Savournin, there will be work for you. From convent to marriage. We don't take risks in society. The lady could fall on a young cock. Losing your virtue is nothing if you lose it for money. The De Marsanne already sold some land. Now they have to sell their daughter. It seems that in her youth, the baroness... If the daughter's like the mother... Hi, everyone. Hello, Michelangelo. When your mermaid has babies, save one for me. Do you know what he would answer? You know sign language, what is he saying? Don't force me to say a word incompatible with my dignity as a notary. My third clerk, what do they say in the castle? This engagement? She won't do anything without consulting me. How is she? Too young, perhaps, for the earl. The earl is perfectly desirable, Sir. Come on, Maximin, I'm talking about my new whip. - -Where's your head? - - Where yours should be. Mister earl seems to judge mademoiselle De Marsanne severely. Of all the parties offered to him, this is certainly the most pleasant, physically speaking. Maybe. But her attitude is quite difficult to deal with. And I'm weighing my words. Women's attitudes are a bit like new shoes. May mister the earl forgive me the image, you must simply put up with them for a few days. But it's not you who will limp, it's me! Moreover, she has no dowry. Miss De Marsanne brings eight quarters of authentic nobility. It's the only dowry the earl has to worry about. You're terrible, Maximin. You speak like a conscience. Does the earl forget that my great-grandfather was already in the service of his family? The servants' nobleness is to remember. It would be sad if the masters were less noble than their servants. Very true. Above all, watch them. But not too much, the earl must be able to declare himself. - -Poor Thérèse. - - Why "poor Thérèse"? I don't know, I have a feeling she's going to be in the cavalry. - -Do you like hunting? - - It's a way to get your heart pumping. I know many other ways! Is it the result of your savings? - -And you like game? - - Yes, when it escapes the hunter! The hunt is over, Mr. De Véteuil, so is fishing! Your daughter is a good rider, but... she's hard to woo. Why do some people say, "He's dumb as his feet." Feet aren't dumb. - -Are you listening to me? - - Yes, go on. There are some people who read palms, I read in the soles. Nothing's more expressive than the shape of the feet. When I hold a shoe, I know the one who wears it. Look, these belong to the little lady of the castle. - -I'll tell you what she's like. - - No, don't say anything. - -Breathe, Julien. - - Yes. It's like holding the smell of the season in your hand. Look at the clouds. They stop or they pass by, and each time, they are what we make them. I don't understand you, Julien. But please keep on speaking, I would like to understand you. We see in the clouds things that others don't see and that exists only for us. Do you mean... the ones we love? Yes, the ones we love. What are you seeing in those clouds, Julien? A face. Ah! You're cheerful, my pretties. I can see why. All-day long with pretty underwear! It's mating season. They're all like that. You don't like my face? Give me some contraband matches, kid. It's stealing from the control room, but... I'm good. - -I don't have change. - - You do! Look carefully. Not in your pockets, silly. Your change is in your eyes, in your smile. On your lips. May I help myself? Let me go! Let me go! You're hurting me! Let me go! Let me go! You're hurting me! Let me go! Julien and Colombel are fighting! Come, hurry! Next time I'll throw you in the water. - -You don't say anything. - - Silence is an opinion. - -May I pay you a compliment? - - If it's witty. - -Personally, I find it funny. - - For the province. Don't you think they'll be happy together? They'll only be separated by the marriage. Keep your stupid thoughts for yourself. You're right. No defeatist talk on the eve of victory. Do you know the right man for you? Every girl has her opinion. I have one. - -Ah, may I know it? - - No, you may not. - -I would like to know your feelings. - - Why? You know my father's and mother's. Aren't they enough for you? You want to conquer all the Marsannes? You especially, miss. You're so young, so smart, so pretty. Pretty as can be. Clumsy. Good evening. Michon! She smiled at me! Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. Hey, you! The employee! Hey, Julien! How do we get service around here? He's always up in the clouds. That's what taxes are for, to pay incompetents like you. Don't talk nonsense, you know nothing about life! I know what it would be like if I marry him. There's nothing more stupid than a love marriage! - -I want to be stupid. - - I was before you. I was crazy about your father. Now, I know that you have to marry with your head. Keep your sentences, I'll keep my freedom. To be free, you have to be rich. Start at the beginning. He'll be a perfect son-in-law, it's up to you to make him a good husband. Make an effort! We go out of our way to please him. The colonel will take him to play diabolo! Diabolo is a charming sport. - -Difficult but charming. - - Oh, fascinating. But I'm here for a wedding. Has your daughter made up her mind? Certainly, but you know young girls. This cursed modesty which prevents them from saying yes immediately. They sulk against their hearts. Don't worry, the Baroness is with Thérèse, everything will be fine. I'll make sure of that. You've my word of honor that the wedding will be announced at the reception. You're like a merchant who has to sell her lot for fear it will rot. A merchant, me? We've never sold anything! Except for your lands and your children. I'll never marry your earl. Why is this? Give at least one valid reason. De Véteuil is rich. He's a poor man. He has 50,000 pounds of income. And not a penny of wit. You should have seen it sooner. You agreed. I just didn't say no. - -That's the same. You'll marry him! - - Never! - -Thérèse! - - Never! So? Everything is fine. I told you. Her mother does what she wants with her. We'll announce the engagement at the reception as promised. You're waiting for Thérèse, aren't you? She's making us wait. Alas, dear lady, this seems indisputable. Mlle De Marsanne doesn't seem very eager to meet me. How little you know her! She enjoys playing hard to get. Simple coquetry, believe me. She's learning her job... of being a woman. She seems remarkably talented to me. Isn't she? Don't be fooled though. She's an angel. But the angels of today have so much experience already. I admit that it's quite disconcerting. Don't worry about the outcome of your charming romance. I know Thérèse. She's a De Marsanne. She will say yes when you least expect it. I agreed to marry Ludobert one day when he had just fallen off his horse. I never fall off my horse. It's a figure of speech. See you later, Monsieur De Véteuil. Aren't you at the reception? All those feet wiggling, spinning, flying, doesn't it sound nice? No. My reception is the reception of the poor. Oh yes. At the reception of the poor, the heart dances. Come along. Come! Go through the small door in the alley. I'll open it for you. Mr. De Véteuil. - -Do you still want to marry me? - - Well, I... Yes or no? Yes, of course. Well, I accept. That's all. Thérèse! We'll start the reception. What are you wearing? Where were you? I've just married Monsieur De Véteuil. See? Everything worked out! I called you here because I need you. You love me, don't you? I know you love me. What would you do for me? Anything. It's difficult, but I need help. I'm listening to you. Swear to do everything I ask of you. I swear. How did he die? It was an accident, right? Miss Thérèse, we're starting to worry, get dressed. Look at you, what happened to you? It's nothing. Be careful, you'll wrinkle my petticoat. How beautiful you are! You're a sight for sore eyes. Where are your gloves? Not the bed, you'll mess up my things. They're in the drawer. There isn't a whiter Blessed Virgin in church than you. I'm ready, let's go. I'm too old for that. I'm going to bed. Have fun, my little Thérèse. You're light, miss, like a feather. No, like a bird! You're not speaking, you're elsewhere. Yes, I am elsewhere. Are you there? We must move him now. We must make him vanish. The river. You've sworn to do whatever I ask. I swear so too. If you want, I can be your reward. Later, tonight. Thérèse! Your behavior is unacceptable! Taking refuge in your room on a day like this? Have a little more judgment, if you don't have feelings. You're the sweetest, and the weirdest fiancée I've ever seen. My beautiful girl, be nice! Tonight is perfect for having fun! Oh, you're lucky I'm afraid of ghosts! You're lucky. You have a nice job. We call you to prepare happiness. Whereas I... Look at these two guys. They must have had fun. It's Colombel! That's a job for you, my friend. You should take him to the station. Drunk and disorderly conduct. The police will turn a blind eye. If I lock him up, he might get offended and not want to play cards anymore. That Colombel! Take care of him, Julien. Don't lose him on the way! My friends, my friends! I have great news. The engagement of our daughter Thérèse to the earl Henri De Véteuil. Julien. Julien! It may be a crime. A crime! You're an accomplice. - -It may be a crime. - - A crime... You're an accomplice! An accomplice... Murderer! - -Murderer... - - Accomplice... Murderer... I did what you asked. You've made me your accomplice. I have the right to know now. I want to know. How can I explain? It's horrible. We were struggling. I was afraid that someone would hear. So I pushed him. Little bitch! You piece of trash! I hurt myself. - -I'll tell them everything! - - No, please! I'll shout it, I'll tell everyone that... - -Thérèse! - - You'll be silent! He died where you found him. You killed him? He was my nanny's son. I grew up with him. We used to play together when were kids. Every time, I wanted to be the strongest. One day I pushed him into the pond because he wasn't obeying me fast enough. I always had bad instincts. Before I was able to understand myself, I scared myself. What's wrong with me? Tell me more, I want to know. Later, when I returned from the convent for the Holidays, I went to see Pierrot. Pierrot, always Pierrot. - -You're obsessed because he's dead. - - No. Because he was alive. Come on! Come on! Faster! Our games became more and more dangerous. Three years ago, in the attic... It lasted three years. At night, I was Pierre Colombel's mistress. And during the day, I was the little Thérèse De Marsanne, an angel. Pierre became more and more demanding. - -When the earl De Véteuil arrived... - - Is the earl your fiancé? Yes. I hate him. Pierre was jealous. He was only my valet and he made a scene. Tonight... I'll go to the reception. I'll make a scandal, I'll shout the truth! - -You have no right. - - I have every right you gave me. You didn't imagine it would last a lifetime? It will last as long as I like, Thérèse. You won't dismiss me like a servant. I'm not a dog you can send back to the doghouse! I'm your lover, whether you like it or not! Imagine the scandal if the butler's son shouted this among your guests. Enough, I forbid you! Let me go! Bitch! Now you know everything. Why did you come to me? You were the only one who could save me. I didn't know you, but I was used to your presence on the other side of the alley. Who else could I turn to but you? I had to be left in my dream. I was less unhappy there than in your reality. If you want, I can keep my promise. No, never! Colombel drowned in the river! Warn the police! He drowned in the river. We found Colombel, he drowned. Poor Colombel, when I think that I saw him last night at midnight with Julien. They were both drunk, it was a pleasure. Yeah. There are pleasures that end badly. Why? - -So you think that... - - Exactly. Don't you think it's obvious? CLOSED - -This is a first! - - He's never sick! There's a dead person, but it is not Julien. I wouldn't wait any longer. I'll repeat the question. Where is Julien? How would I know? We don't work together. I repair the soles, he wears them out. Come on, Michon, answer. You know something. Don't make us go around in circles. I make everyone walk around. That's what my job is about. Okay, I get it. We'll have to go after him. - -Are my new boots ready? - - They'll be ready tonight, brigadier. Perfect. With a spike under the heel. Brigadier, what brings you here? Are you the named Colombel Joseph, born in 1841, on July 22nd, and currently a butler for the Baroness De Marsanne? Come on, we've known each other forever. Want a drink? In conformity with the law, in accordance with my duty and with the usual care, I inform you that your son, Colombel Pierre, has been murdered. What do you say? Pierrot? Murdered? The death was duly noted by the medical examiner. My little Pierre. I can't believe it. Here are the details. This morning at 9:17 a.m. on the banks of the Chanteclair, washerwomen found the body of a drowned man with a wound in the neck. Pierre! Is it too late for that drink? Thérèse! Thérèse! Pierre! - -Pierre, my little Pierre. - - What's the matter, Françoise? They killed him, it's awful, they drowned him. - -It's impossible. - - It's impossible, but it's true. The brigadier came and told Joseph. My little Pierre. My poor Françoise, how can that be? Pierrot. If I knew whoever did this. We will hang him, the gendarmes promised. My Pierrot, my little boy. Don't talk all at once. - -Did you know him? - - Of course, I knew him! A handsome guy with no pride. He was a clerk at Maître Savournin's. He was always fooling around. He knew how to talk to women. Was he often with Julien, the mailman? Oh, Julien! Yes Julien, what a bad guy. The other day he was fighting with Colombel. And he beat him. He even told him, "If you do it again, I'll throw you in the water." If we weren't there, he would have done it. You're confusing me. Why did Julien make these threats? Let me through! It's because of that good-for-nothing! Julien defended me. Liar! Scum! Julien's strong, he's the best, that's what you can't forgive him! No mistake, Julien did it. Well, that's bad news. We'll need a new partner to play cards now. The dressmaker is here for the fitting. Come quickly. You'll be a beautiful bride, miss. I'll be back to give you my advice. Thérèse, be calm. Beauty begins as a gift and ends as patience. Pass me the pins, Ernestine. Thank you. I didn't sleep all night thinking about this wedding. I'm already not sleeping because of Pierre. My poor Françoise. The whole country pities you. They were my two children. We'll catch that punk. I know, but it won't give me my boy back. But you'll be avenged. As the mayor said to my husband, we must not let this assassin run. We're going to let the dogs loose. Let them tear him apart, he deserves it. Let me go! Fontenoy. Lowendal's cavalry. Destrée's regiment. Back to the Scheldt, no retreat. Poor Marshal de Saxe, he was defeated 100 times and as proof, I launch the infantry, I break the French line and bam! When you think... "Englishmen, shoot first." I'm going to get some ammunition. That's right, Colonel, while I count our last cartridges. Mom, I can't keep quiet anymore, I'm not allowed to. We must tell everyone before it's too late. Thérèse, what's wrong? Listen to me carefully. - -I killed Pierre Colombel. - - What are you saying? I thought the convent cured you of lying. Couldn't you come up with something less serious and more plausible? You must believe me. If you think you can escape this marriage, by talking such nonsense, you're mistaken. Why would you kill Colombel? - -Because he was my lover. - - Will you please shut up! A De Marsanne the mistress of a servant? You're out of line! Someone could hear you! I'll say it, I'll tell everyone. You'll have to believe me! What is it now? - -Father, you'll believe me. - - Thérèse, be quiet. Have you heard her latest delusion? My dear, I'm in the middle of the battle of Fontenoy. - -Do you know what she's saying? - - Less and less. Your daughter here accuses herself of... Ah. I'll never be able to say it. - -I killed Pierre Colombel. - - What? I killed Pierre Colombel. You? killed? And that's nothing, it gets better. Do you know why she says she killed him? Because he... Because... I'll never be able to say that either. Because he was my lover. This is beyond the limits of bad taste. That you fill your head with the bad literature of this period, that's fine, that it gives you flashes of unhealthy imagination, I'll admit that without excusing it, but that on the eve of your wedding you say a servant was your lover, that's madness. It's the truth, but it scares you. - -Enough. Go to your fitting. - - You refuse to believe me? You've made a fool of yourself long enough, now leave. So be it. You'll regret it. Thank God, it's M. De Véteuil who will deal with her delusions from now on. I look forward to this wedding like a castaway looks for a plank. And she just got back from the convent! Nice to see you, Thérèse. - Sister Marie- - Louise, may I speak to our mother? You look upset. What's wrong? Speak to her alone, Mother, I'll wait for you. It's a very painful task that you impose on me. I told them the truth, they didn't want to hear it because it came from me. They might hear it more if it comes from God. My task is difficult, but God in his mercy will have mercy on us and help us. Speak, Mother, you look troubled. I'm here by request of your daughter. She made a painful confession to me this morning, it's my duty to report it to you. Thérèse accused herself of the murder of Pierre Colombel. She had to go tell that the nuns. This is insane, 150 women... Excuse me, Mother. Holy women prattling on about this stupid story. We only talk to God, sir. This secret would not be the first to be buried within the convent. So, let's not talk about it anymore! It's my duty to make you remember yours. Listen to your conscience, sir. Listen to your common sense first, Mother. Colombel was found in the river. Could Thérèse carry a corpse two kilometers at night wearing a dress? It's ridiculous, Mother, Thérèse has not left the castle. I see that there is something troubling about this. Troubling? Excuse me, Mother, Thérèse made fun of you. She always makes things up. If there is some doubt, it would be your duty to clear this up. Certainly not. I've never enjoyed making a fool of myself. I'm not talking to the superior - of the convent Sainte- - Marie, but to Miss Catherine De Germain, who must remember the great name she bore before taking the veil. There cannot be two truths. Precisely. So please admit that there is only one, ours, the truth of the good people. - -I find this approach inappropriate! - - Ludobert! Françoise! Here is the mother of the poor victim. Francoise, come downstairs. Françoise, you who raised our Thérèse, tell our Mother what you think of her. Our little Thérèse is so lovable, she's so pretty, so innocent. My little Pierre got along so well with her. - -You see? - - I see. You have every reason to be right, ma'am. You've sinned grievously, my child, you've lied. - -They didn't believe you, did they? - - No. Maybe I wasn't convinced enough myself to convince them. The evidence is in now. God himself is afraid of scandal. Michon! Michon! It's me, Julien! Are you crazy? The police will find you here. I'm leaving right away. I'm hiding in the mountains, in the old hut. I'm hungry. I'll prepare something for you, but first, you must answer. - -Why did you do that? - - You think I killed him too. It's not true. But I can't tell you. But I'm as miserable as if I'd really done it. Julien! You have to leave! You have to leave right away! Ludobert, aren't you going to bed? Just a minute. - -Anaïs? - - What do you want? - -What if it was true? - - What? - -What Thérèse told us. - - It's not true. But what if it was? Thérèse's fantasies are enough for me, no need to add yours. Come sleep instead. We're alone right now. What if it was true? Then it would be the end of a name that is our last reason to live. It would be the first time in four centuries Ludobert. For the first time the opportunity would be given to a De Marsanne to blush with shame and bow their head. That would be your end, mine, Thérèse's. The end of a world. The end of the world. But it's not true, it can't be because it has no right to. We must telegraph Véteuil and marry Thérèse right away. You've changed the fate of enough illustrious battles to save your family. - -That's right. - - Believe me. It's no more difficult than beating Napoleon at Austerlitz. - -Who told you I was here? - - Michon, the cobbler. - -Why are you here? - - I had to see you. The gendarmes are on your trail. You must flee. - -You're afraid that I'll talk. - - No! As long as I'm hiding, you'll be more comfortable. After all, my escape is a confession. - -It's better for you to prolong it. - - I don't fear the truth. I said it, I told everyone. They didn't believe me! And I'm afraid they won't believe you. My parents will do anything to lose you and save me. Go away, I'm serious. You must flee, it's dangerous. Nothing is serious anymore. Thanks to you, I had forgotten for a moment that I was ugly, poor, alone. I believed in myself because I believed in you. Now it's all over. Leave me to my ugliness, to my loneliness, to my poverty. Don't talk about poverty, Julien. I have gathered everything I own. I give it to you. You can flee, start a new life. I don't want them to condemn you. They'll catch me, they'll condemn me, unless they kill me on the spot, like a bandit, like the bandit I've become through you, for you. - -Julien, you're hurting me. - - You can't understand. They think I'm the killer, but that's not what I'm blaming you for. It's for having allowed me to believe in love, to believe that by serving you we would be closer when everything separates us, our lives, our dreams, our classes. That's your real crime. Now leave! - -Let me help you. - - Go away! Take back your place in society! And leave me alone! Are you having a love marriage or a money marriage? A love marriage. You're doing the money marriage. - -Véteuil, you forget yourself. - - You, baron, you don't forget anything. - -I'm giving you my daughter. - - I'm delighted. But it's costing me a lot. Come on, gentlemen, we are among gentlemen. Marriage is marriage, business is business. I propose a transaction. A usufruct. Speculate on my head! Sir, what do you think? With certain precautions, we can accept this deal. Very well. Let's make an effort. My son-in-law, I congratulate you. The hymen is a charming thing. The first 30 years are difficult, but after that, it's paradise. Michon was kind to send me food, but I don't need it anymore. I'm going back. I'm going back because I've had enough. She offered me money. Money, as if I were a mercenary. I've thought it through. Everyone must know. A poor man won't pay for the rich. I'm going back to say everything. If I see Thérèse, I'll strangle her! Let me go! Julien! You can't come back, leave at once. They'll hurt you. I don't care. Where is everyone? I must tell them. At church or on the square. To see the wedding. The wedding? Yes, Miss Thérèse's wedding. M. Henri de Véteuil, will you take Miss Thérèse de Marsanne here present for your lawful wife according to the rite of our Holy Mother Church? Yes, I do. Miss Thérèse de Marsanne, will you take M. Henri de Véteuil here present for your lawful husband according to the rite of our Holy Mother Church? - -Yes, I do. - - Join your right hands. In nomine patris et filii et spiritus sancti, amen. Julien, I'm arresting you, but I don't want to. Yes, if ever you had anything to say... I have nothing to say. Bastard! Julien is innocent! Julien! Julien! Julien! Julien! Julien!
