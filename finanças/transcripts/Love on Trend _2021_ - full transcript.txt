What do you think? Would you wear these to a real office? Hmm, with a tailored top, maybe on casual Friday? "Don't Sweat It, From Running a Marathon to Running a Meeting," is that too long for a headline? No, I love it. Remember that junior designer position I interviewed for? It's down to me and one other designer! For Catalina Garibaldi? My dream job! This isn't your dream job? You know you're the best for letting me work here while I get settled. Well, I am rooting for you, even though you are the best writer, assistant, office manager, stylist, photographer I've ever had. It's a good thing you never got me business cards. So how do you plan on clinching the job? Hope they like my work better? It's a cutthroat industry, you have to go for it. You can't just hope that it's going to work out. Like my mom always says, if they don't pick you, it's not meant to be. Your mom is lovely, but she works at a doggy daycare in a town with more dogs and people. I don't know if I would take her career advice. What am I supposed to do, send them a singing telegram with a gorilla begging for the job? No, although I do love visual. Allie, you got to fight for your dreams. They don't just land in your lap. Not my style. I just have to distract myself while I wait. Well, I got that covered. Our favorite movie theater is having a Hitchcock retrospective. Dinner and "Psycho?" Sounds like my last date. And then next weekend, it's "The Birds." As if movie night can get anywhere exciting! Not sure exciting is the right word for a night at the dollar theater. But watching old movies is where I get my best 1950s slang, like scalawag and crumb bum. Those are classic insults. And maybe while we're out, we'll get some good news about the job, and then we could afford the $2 theater. Oh, you spoil me! You spoil me. - How does this look? - Cute. I love it. Casual chic is in. Cool. Hey. Hey, I'm about to buy our movie tickets online. Do you want to eat first and then watch the 8 o'clock, or do the 5:30, and have dinner after? Allie? Oh, sorry. This town car just pulled up at the club across the street. It's either an A-lister or someone who desperately needs to make an entrance. It's a little early for the club scene. Probably just a prom. They have proms at clubs here? Mine was at our school gym, a tiki theme, which worked because our gym was always strangely humid. Oh! Not a prom, some models just got out. Oh, fringe! Remember when that was trending at Fashion Week? Ugh, fringe. Someday, it'll be us getting out of limos wearing something impractical. Yeah, maybe. Hello? Sorry, had to dump out some snap peas. The microwave took out all the snap. Hold on. Ooh. Uh-oh. Allie? Hello? Allie? Sorry I'm late. Had to get a new phone this morning. Garbage disposal, one, Allie, zero. Well, better your phone than your finger. Got you the usual. I think the new barista was going for a heart. Mine looks more like a kidney. Mine looks like Australia. Any word yet from Catalina? No, I e-mailed them my new number this morning. They're still deciding. I've been working so hard on my portfolio. I wish I moved here after design school. Well, you can't change the past, as we've learned from all time travel movies. You know, step on a butterfly, and come back to a dinosaur setting your house on fire. You're so weird. Anyway, we're here now, and even if you don't get this one, you're going to get the next one. You're so talented. I know my big break is coming, I just wish I knew when. Hello? Cassidy? No, sorry. You have the wrong number. Aw, looks like our photo department just got an upgrade. Hmm, let me give you my new number. My new San Francisco number! Oh! Hi, Marla. Oh, I thought it would be better to meet down here. Who knew renovating our offices would be so loud and dusty? Everyone who told you to wait until we weren't so busy. But I do love being outside. That's why I'm building you a window office. That new biotech startup you brought us is going public. You can certainly spot talent. Anyway, I wanted to circle back and see if you've heard from Cassidy. She knows that she has to present the fall collection industry at the boutique opening next month. Is there anyone else in her office who can finish her designs? Cassidy has many talents but delegation isn't one of them. She's, uh, very secretive. Even her staff. Colin, I invested in her line because you vouched for her. She's brilliant, but I cannot work with a flake. I'm sure she has a rational explanation for taking off. Ah, well, I don't care if she was abducted by aliens. That's irrational. If I don't see those designs by the end of the week, I am cutting our losses and pulling our investment. But what about everyone who works for her? They don't deserve to lose their jobs. That's on Cassidy, not you. These are good people, Marla. They shouldn't have to pay the price. I hired you at this firm for your tech background. You can spot the next best thing, if it's an app. I don't know why you decided to dabble in fashion. OK, I believed in Cassidy's vision, we invested in her, and we made her a huge star. I never expected that she would take off. Let me fix this. You really think you can track her down and get her to finish her designs? I have to try. OK, look, she's been spotted overseas. So we know she's OK. Maybe she's back in town by now. She has to be on a panel tonight. I hope you're right. I'll take care of this. Good luck. And one more with your arm down. OK. Awesome. Get any good shots? So many! Great, then it's time for lunch. Two, please. Sauerkraut and mustard. If I die, you're out of my will. Don't you actually have to own something to have a will? Hello? No, this isn't her number anymore. Sorry, I don't know how to reach her. Another wrong number. You won't believe this. My new number used to belong to Cassidy Clark. As in, the Cassidy Clark? I have all of her wrap dresses! She keeps getting these text invites to everything, and she has this ex-boyfriend named TG who's sending her the saddest texts. What are the odds that you'd inherit a famous fashion designer's number? Whoever had my old number owed a lot of money to a collections agency. She has the wife I want. Invitations to Fashion Week in Paris, parties, backstage tickets to concerts! I wonder why she changed her number. Hmm, she's doing a portfolio review tonight. They just sent her a confirmation text with all the details. Right, so you can ask her. They're only accepting designers by invitation, I can't just show up. You have her phone number, I'm sure she wants to know who's been trying to reach her. Besides her heartbroken ex-boyfriend? Wish my ex was that devoted. Your ex was a jerk who didn't believe in you. It's at the Fashion Institute, just bring your portfolio. Maybe if I had a good cover story, like I'm writing for your blog. Don't overthink it, just show up, say you have an invitation, and the worst that can happen is that they shoo you away. That would be embarrassing! You're not committing a crime! There's no event-crashing jail. Anyway we have a date with Hitchcock. Here you go. Cheers. I'm here for the portfolio review. Let me scan you. OK, I have your badge. Oh, I'm not Cassidy. She's a no show, you can fill in. But I should probably have my own... Next! I'm starving. That cheese plate's been out all night. I survived a hot dog cart, four-hour old cheese will only make me stronger. Ah, you ARE here. Did you see where Cassidy Clark went? Cassidy? No. OK. Can you tell her that Colin borrowed her portfolio and she can pick it up at the office? Marla, I have Cassidy's designs. I'm at the Fashion Institute. Bye. Hey, where's my portfolio? Some guy named Colin took it? I don't know any Colin! Whoa! Hey! Give me that portfolio! That's my work! Well, wait, wait, wait. This isn't Cassidy Clark's? Because her name badge is right there. Not that that would make you any less of a thief, but it's mine. I was filling in for her. Give it back, you crumb bum! That is the most adorable insult I've ever heard. I watch a lot of old movies. Well, I am Colin Ferguson. I'm Cassidy's investor, and she said she'd give me her designs tonight, so I thought those were hers. And, as you would say, that is not a bunch of malarkey. I would never say that. May I? Thanks. These are really good. Do you really mean that? No, I'm just saying that because you tried to mug me, and I'm really scared. I did take self-defense classes before I moved to San Francisco. No, but seriously, these are... These are really good. Like, mind-blowingly good. Thank you! Where do you work? I'm freelancing right now. I think I have a job with Catalina Garibaldi. I mean, she's no Cassidy Clark, but it would be a really great place to be. Well, they'd be crazy not to hire you. Thanks. Good luck. Sorry about the misunderstanding. No, it's OK. Actually, I have a proposition. How well do you know Cassidy's style? Really well. I knocked off one of her dresses for my cousin's wedding. Don't tell her that. Could you make a couple pieces for her fall line? Are you offering me the job? Not exactly. Marla! This is my boss. Please play along. Colin, let me take a look at Cassidy's designs. Uh, sure. Where's Cassidy? She couldn't be here. But this is... Allie Eaterling. She's Cassidy design director. I didn't know she had a design director. Yeah, hot new talent, just got promoted. She's overseeing things while Cassidy's out of town. Oh, I love this. Very original. Most are kind of a radical departure from Cassidy's style. This one is stunning, I want to see more like it. Uh, the other designs might add a little variety to the collection. I'd like to see something closer to Cassidy's spring line. Something successful, why mess with it? Well, Allie and I will chat, get you some new sketches. But I'm not... Did you leave your dog in the car, Marla? Because I'm pretty sure I just heard a yelp. I better go. Nice work, Ellie. It's Allie. What was that? I'm trying to save Cassidy's company. I need your help. You want me to lie to your boss? Just until we find Cassidy. It's a great opportunity for you. Not if I can't use my original designs, or get credit. Any job is going to make you work in their style. But it would be a job. Listen, we just left a whole room full of design students would probably love to help. Allie, my job is to invest in talent, and you clearly have it. That's nice of you to say, but I can't help. Ah, OK. Hot, hot, hot! What's that? Chicken soup, extra noodles, no carrots. Oh, you're the best! How are you feeling? You look better. It's amazing what 15 hours of sleep will do. I ended up crashing the portfolio review. And, how did it go? Did Cassidy see your work? I met her investor, Colin, and apparently she's AWOL. Oh, who's this Colin? Cute, single, sane? Yes, unsure, and jury's still out. He has no idea why Cassidy skipped out before finishing her fall line. Did she meet with foul play? You're watching too much Hitchcock. She's fine. She's just off the grid, probably on some tropical island getaway. Ugh, why isn't that in my life? Anyway, he wants me to design some pieces for her boutique opening. As Cassidy. Is that crazy, or what? You said he was cute! Well, yeah, but that had something to do with anything. He stole my portfolio and wants me to lie about my designs! Or he thinks you're talented enough to work for one of the city's hottest designers. You think I should do it? All I'm saying is you've been looking for a job like this since you got here. You save Cassie's company, maybe it'll turn into a real job. I'm going to get a real job. I'm supposed to hear from Catalina any day now. Well, it's all about connections, and you just met a big time investor. Still, no. Let me get you a bowl. OK, thank you. You're welcome. This isn't Cassidy Clark. Oh, Catalina! Sorry. This... this is Allie! OK, thanks for considering me. Hi, Allie. Any news on the job? Hi, mom. You didn't get it. How did you guess? When you have good news, you're excited, like one of our puppies here. They actually said that I was the better designer. Somebody in the company pushed for the other guy. Then it wasn't meant to be. Just like all the other jobs I've interviewed for? Allie, I may not have a glamour job, but all of my dog's come through referrals. Maybe you need to get out more! Well, San Francisco is a really hard place to make friends. I'm working for Kendra all day, and then on my designs at night. It doesn't matter how good your work is if no one sees it. Bailey, don't eat that! Honey, I got to go. Someone thinks the ottoman is a chew toy. OK, love you, mom. You look great. Thank you. OK, here goes operation expand my social network. It's always about who you know. Or in this case, who Cassidy knows. Which apparently, is everyone. You never know who you might meet at these places. This looks at the perfect place for a power lunch. This is Arturo Franco's new restaurant, the judge from Super Chef! Yeah. Do you think he's here? Those celebrity chefs never actually run their own restaurants. I just read an article about this place. You can't get a reservation for the next three months. Not that I want to spend a week salary on fancy spaghetti and meatballs. Yeah, true. Uh, we're here for the restaurant opening. Password is mascarpone, or mascarpone? However you say it. Go right in. I can't believe we got away with that. This spot looks good. Wow. It pays to be Cassidy. This was the only invitation that was really interesting. I am not crashing one of her friend's parties or going to the clubs that she comes up for. No wonder she didn't finish her designs. Yep. Another text for Cassidy. One of her friends just bought an island. Wow, I am in the wrong profession. I can't even afford a kitchen island. It's Colin! Did he see me? Uh, well, since I don't know what he looks like, I have no intel for you. Changing my answer to yes. Who are we hiding from? It's not me, is it? Oh, we're just getting a better look at the menu. Colin, this is my friend Kendra. It's nice to meet you. How do you two know Arturo? We don't, but I've watched the show a bunch, so I feel like I know him. Because he only my friends and family these launches. I'm impressed. Kendra has a blog. You're a food critic? Fashion. I'm here to review the waitstaff uniform. And now is a perfect time for me to go do that. OK. So, I have a great table over there, if you and Kendra want to join me. Sure! So, do you really know Arturo Franco, or are you just dropping his name to look cool? I have known Arturo for a long time. When I first moved here, I was a server and he was a sous chef. I can't see you as a waiter. I will prove it. So, we stayed friends after I got fired. Hopefully not for your napkin folding skills. No, the owner was keeping our tips. So, I stood up for the servers, and they got the money, I got canned. I'm sorry. No, that was for the best. Two weeks later, I got my first job in tech. That led to venture capital, and then my firm helped Arturo opened his first restaurant. Ta-da! Impressive. So, have you given any more thought to my offer? I already told you. No. OK, well just hear me out. If it's still a no, I'll get up. You'll never see me again. Fine. Tell me why I should pretend to be someone I'm not and get a huge designer very angry at me. Marla's getting ready to cut our funding. If that happens, Cassidy's fall line won't go into production. Well, if Cassidy worried about that, she shouldn't have taken off on her tropical island getaway. Yeah, Cassidy will be fine, but you know it won't be fine? Factory workers making her clothes. The pattern makers, the salespeople expecting the work in the boutique that won't open. They don't have island getaways. They have families who depend on them. And, if you help save Cassidy, you're helping to save their jobs. Let me guess, I'm saving your job, too. Sure, but I'll be OK. Look, I've met the people who work for Cassidy, and whatever reason she has for leaving, she would not want to hurt them. If I decided to help, how would it work? Uh, we would tell Marla that as design director, Cassidy has giving you some preliminary sketches, and the samples will be ready for the boutique opening. One condition. Name it. I want to include some of my originals. Fine. I can have them ready for you by next week? Meeting's at 4:00 PM today. As in, a few hours from now? Marla sets a deadline or she pulls a plug. What would you have done if I had said no? I would have given you said puppy eyes until you said yes. Colin, you didn't tell me you were bringing a date. Oh, we're not together. Allie's an amazing fashion designer. She's helping me on a project. Well, this is for you, and some appetizers, too. On the house, of course. I'm sure you're busy. I can just order from one of your servers. No problem at all. I wouldn't even have this place if it wasn't for Colin. But I should probably go see what that was. Thanks, Arturo. Wow. Whoa! So sorry, are you OK? - You're... - A klutz? I know, I should watch where I'm going. I was going to say Arturo Franco, but you probably already knew that. I'm a huge fan. Or you were. That's going to stain. Send me the dry cleaning bill. Oh, no. This is washable. Just give me a couple quarters and I'm good. How about I buy you and your friends lunch? I'm really sorry, I have to run, but it was nice to meet you. A couple of quarters. I just got us free lunch. You're welcome. Actually, I have to work. And I have a meeting to get ready for. Kendra, you should stay. Where everyone who passes by can see me sitting alone with a huge red wine stain on my shirt? No, thank you. I'll just leave. Don't judge me. Oh, I should get your number. Uh, I'm out of minutes. Weird data plan. Email is better. Do you have a card? I do. See you soon. What's that all about? Tell you in a minute. I have a conference call in five minutes, did you tell Cassidy today was the deadline? Allie will be here. She's reliable. Didn't you just meet her at a portfolio review? Yeah, but I have a good feeling. You had a good feeling about Cassidy, and now I am looking at the largest loss I've had in years. I'm sorry, you're going to have to tell the boutique employees... Get ready to sell the fall line! Sketches are a little rough, but you get the idea. When Marla says 4 o'clock, she means 3:45. I was still sketching at 3:45. OK. So, they're just OK? OK, you keep your funding. I am very impressed. Allie, I'd also like you to handle the boutique opening. Uh, aren't there event planners for that? I mean, Allie is going to be very busy getting the samples ready. Actually, I'd love to. I already have some ideas. Fantastic. I'm off to an interesting pitch, Purr Coin, cryptocurrency for cats. Good work, you two. Nicely done! We invest in some very strange things. Someone actually came up with a virtual eraser, and... I'm boring you. No, I'm just... Really needing some caffeine right now Well, Marla's got a stash of civet coffee. The kind that goes through a weasel's digestive system? Civet cat, but let's get you some normal coffee. I like that idea. Kendra and I play this game where we try to guess what the foam is supposed to be. Like reading tea leaves? Something like that. It actually looked like a heart today. I think the barista's playing psychology experiments on us. You look more awake. If I don't have my afternoon coffee, I feel like I'm jet-lagged, without going anywhere fun. These are really, really amazing. - You out- - Cassidy'd Cassidy. I didn't get a chance to get to my originals. I want to take Cassidy's designs and make them edgier and more affordable. What made you want to become a designer? I think I was born with it. I used to make clothes for my dolls, and then I made close to my dogs. Well, do what you love and success follows. Ah, if success was on my trail, I think it got lost. I couldn't afford to take an unpaid internship after design school, so I didn't get a job and I kind of gave up. Ah, I get it. I mean, Cassidy's parents had a lot of connections. She just happened to be talented. What happened to her? Is she OK? I think she got too famous, too fast. Her line was the head of Paris Fashion Week, and then she said she wanted a week or so off, but one day just left. Didn't tell anyone where she was going. I wonder why she hasn't returned any calls or texts. Uh, actually... Oh! Got it. Shall we? Yeah. So what were you going to tell me earlier? Oh, I was going to ask you how you got into venture capital. I was an app developer, which I loved. Marla invested in one of my ideas, which tanked. And she needed someone who really knew the tech world well, so she offered me a job at the firm. You like it? For the most part. I do like taking an idea and making it real, but I miss coming up to my own projects. Tech might sound boring to an artist, but it's actually really creative. I don't think it's boring at all. You see a problem in the world and use tech to solve it. Like an app that lets you know when the wind is picking up so your cup doesn't fly away. So, can you still come up with your own ideas and bring them to Marla? Ah, yeah, turns out that I'm better at finding the million-dollar idea than I am in coming up with them. Marla is all about the money. She... sometimes we butt heads. Just have to come up with the right idea. Oh, whoa! Nice save. Hey, do you want to see the boutique? I mean, it's just an empty storefront right now. Sure. They literally just sell James? Otherwise it's just false advertising. Whoa! Are you OK? I'm just really glad you're here. You know, to save me from dangerous scooters. Here we are. Hope your imagination's still intact. So, it's not much to look at now. We could put the fall line up front, and classics and accessories in the back. And the fitting rooms? We can make it anything we want it to be. What did this space used to be? It was another clothing store, actually. They lasted about a year. Tough biz. We need something to set us apart. Make it a cool shopping experience. We could add some nice furniture. I always like when there's some comfortable man chairs A man chair? You know, like, when the girlfriend takes you shopping and she tries on every outfit in the store, so you and the other boyfriends just sit in the man chairs. And what do you do in these man chairs? Talk with the other guys? Answer emails, maybe play a game on your phone, check the scores. What if the chairs have little TVs where you can watch the game? That would be less torturous. I think we could really upgrade the whole boutique experience. A lot of the new stores are using tech, which we got! You're the expert. Actually, I have some friends who are working a virtual mirror. Clothing automatically adjusts to the customer's size, and you can send your outfits to your friends, straight over social media, directly from the screen. See, you have great ideas! I would consider that a pretty good idea. Bringing you on board, that's a great idea. What? Is there a spider? Not that I'm afraid of spiders. I think some flowers might add a little warmth. Like roses? Anything but those. Wow, I've never actually met a girl who doesn't like roses. It's a story for another time. I should probably get back to work. There is also a spider. Smells amazing. Why are you feeding me? Arturo sent dinner. You picked the wrong day to skip out of work. Wait, Arturo Franco? Mm-hm. He sent a note. He said that since we left before he could pick up the tab, he had to deliver it. I think he sent the whole menu. He must like you. I'm not his type. How do you know what his type is? I can't even get the accountant across the hall to go on a second date. A celebrity chef might be a stretch. Is that the boutique? Colin took me to the space so I could get some inspiration. Spent all day with him. I know I owe you an article. Two, actually. Anyway, I think he's interested in more than just your designs. He's trying to save Cassidy's company and all her employees. I can tell you like him. That guy you're drawing in the chair? That's Colin. It's a generic man chair guy. Where is your extinguisher, because your pants are so on fire. It doesn't matter, I can't go out with anyone I work with. You don't really work with him. Well, even worse, if things go wrong, I lose my big break. Colin is going to talk to Marla about selling some of my pieces. I'd like to see some of these at Fashion Week. Definitely not Cassidy's style. I want mine to go at a lower price point than Cassidy's, and be made from sustainable material. What if I had a fashion show during the boutique opening? Mix some of my pieces in with Cassidy's. When Marla sees how much people love my designs, she'll have to go for it. That's a great idea. You should text Colin. Uh, no can do. I have to email him. Trying to keep it professional? He can't know that I'm calling from Cassidy's number. He'll think I kidnapped her or something. Why is he going to think that? I don't know, because he keeps saying she didn't get back to anyone. If he knew I was reading her messages, he'd think it was creepy. I wouldn't worry about that. Anyway, what's new with her ex? It's so sad. Everything reminds TG of Cassidy. Poor guy. I hope they work it out. Should we dig in? Yes, I am starving. Wait, hold on. You go on without me. I'm slowing you down. We're just jogging, not escaping from zombies. Well, we almost made it a mile. That's OK. I just like being outside, some fresh air we never would get in the city. Day time is overrated. I had two hours of sleep last night after the crowd left. Went to a party, you should have been there. Nah, I got another meeting with Marla and Allie today. You used to be able to go out all night and still make it in to work the next day. Yeah, that's when I was in tech, set my own hours. Now I wear a suit and say things like "ducks in a row" and "shift in the paradigm." I thought you liked being in venture capital. You're making people's dreams come true. You're like the man the Fairy Godmother. Yeah, it's stable. Unlike the startup life. But I do miss coming up with my own dreams, even if I couldn't make my ideas work. Just didn't have the right apps, it's not too late. Nah, man, it's tough get inspired these days. If I can't save Cassidy's company, a lot of good people are going to lose their jobs. It's not fair. Think Marla would fire you, too? I wouldn't blame her. I staked my reputation on Cassidy, now she won't even return my texts. I thought Allie was going to step in. She's got potential, but I don't know if she has experience to pull this off. Well, you're a good judge of talent. You got Marla to invest in my company. You must see something in Allie. I can see how passionate she is about her work, like you are about cooking. Like I used to be about my apps. Well, I mean, aside from the work stress, this is the happiest I've seen you in weeks. Are you sure there isn't something going on between you and Allie? I just met her. So? So, I... I can't start dating someone right now. I can't have another thing go wrong in my life. Not everything ends badly. OK. You know, I think you recovered. Race you to the park! I expanded on Cassidy's formal jumpsuits for the fall, and I think her live-in capri pants could look great with a hounds tooth pattern. Well, you can't go wrong with a jumpsuit. Unless it's orange and you're in prison. And for the boutique, we're thinking about adding a digital mirror. That uses augmented reality, so you can see the clothes in different colors without having to try on a new item. Which cuts down on the time it takes to shop. And, there's a waiting room. With personal TVs, so nobody's pressuring our shoppers to leave. Allie, did you come up with that idea? Actually, it was Colin's. I'm not great with tech. Colin, I've never known you to give this much input. You two certainly work well together. Well, I think Allie has taken Cassidy's vision in a very good direction. Good. And how's the launch party going. Some thoughts on that. We want to put on a fashion show. Really get everyone excited about the fall line. If people are watching, they're not buying. We need to see some solid numbers. I disagree. The fashion show will energize people about the brand. We can even raise money for charity. Then we'd have to choose a cause. We don't want Cassidy Clark's name associated with doom and gloom. Let's just make it a fun party. OK, maybe the charity angle was wrong, but I really think... Fun party it is. I'll hit up the PR team and make sure we get some good coverage. Great. That was a great meeting. Mostly, but with no fashion show, no one will be able to see my work. Well, when Marla less no, you don't want to push back. But she left everything else, so we just have to pick our battles. Well, you know her better than I do. We'll figure something out. I promise. What title do you like better, "Be My Vest" or "Wild, Wild, Vest?" Yeah. Come on, you usually love my punny titles. What's wrong? Sorry, I thought Colin had my back with Marla, but I don't know. She doesn't want to do the fashion show. Then bring your best samples and show her anyway. It's not like you officially work for Marla. What's the worst that can happen? I don't want Colin to get in trouble. He's on your side. He just needs to keep Marla happy so she doesn't pull the plug on Cassidy's company. You're right. So I was thinking of doing an article on restaurant uniforms, and maybe interviewing Arturo. That's a different angle. I haven't seen a fashion blog do it. No, I mean that's a different excuse to spend time with the guy you like. It's just business. Like you and Colin, right? Hmm. What about "Invest In Vests?" That's either genius, or completely terrible. I can't tell. Can you take some photos if me in this vest? Uh, can I do it later? I have to run to the boutique to sign for the furniture. Can't someone else do it? You're doing everything for this launch. It'll be worth it. Why did I agree to do this? I thought of a way to have a fashion show. What if we do an after party? That way, it won't interfere with Cassidy shoppers. That sounds cool and exclusive. You're cool. I'm so not. You're talented. You are smart. You are good with mannequins. Clarissa agrees. Oh, Clarissa! These clothes are so lovely! Hi, do you have time for an interview? I always have time for my favorite customer. Well, technically, I've never eaten here. I wanted to ask you about how you pick the uniforms for your wait staff. I didn't give it much thought. Guess it kind of shows, doesn't it? Kind of looks like they're off to set a heist in an art museum. Mm, sorry. Guess I'm not giving you much for your article, am I? At least the uniforms look comfortable. That's what I was going for, but if I wanted to change it, maybe you'd have some ideas? I could maybe do some research for you. Looks like you got to go. Talk to you another time? I think the digital mirror can go here. And, jeans and tops up front. You ever design menswear? I've never tried. I usually only make clothes that I can wear. Ah, sorry. I got to meet a potential new client. I think I'll stay here for a bit. Get some inspiration. OK, see you later. Oh! Clarissa, keep an eye on her. She's trouble. Hey, mom. I just have to tell you, I wore the dress that you made me for my birthday, and I got tons of compliments. Thanks, but I'm totally over losing that job. I actually have an amazing opportunity. A new job? Why didn't you tell me? Well, I'm helping out this guy in San Fran, this designer that I totally love ran out on her deadlines, and I get to finish up her full collection. Congrats, I knew you could do it. Just one catch, I can't take any credit for any of the work, it's more like I'm ghostwriting, but for clothes. Well, at least it's a step in the right direction. This designer doesn't sound very responsible. She's not, she put her company in a really bad place. Colin says I'm saving a lot of jobs. Colin? Tell me about this guy you just met. He's great. He really gets me. I'm making him a shirt as a thank you. You don't just make clothes for anybody. Something you want to tell me? There's nothing going on. It's just that he's the only person, besides you guys and Kendra, that believe in me. His boss is even putting me in charge of the boutique opening party. Well, that sounds like a lot. It is, but they need me. Well, just make sure they don't take advantage. What do you mean? Allie, you can never say no when somebody needs help, but if you're working this hard, just make sure you have something to show for it. Don't worry, he's got my back. Hope so. Hey, does dad want to shirt? I can make two. Dad has enough shirts. I want you to get some sleep. OK. Love you, mom. I created some apps to improve customer engagement with the brand. I'm more concerned about your engagement with the brand. You seem to have an unusual interest in this boutique, and in Allie. Look, I just... I believe in her. Which is why I think she should get that fashion show. We can do an after party, so it doesn't interfere with Cassidy's line. Colin, I am worried your personal feelings are interfering with your involvement in the project. Hold on, me and Allie? No, it's purely professional. You haven't brought me any tech startups. That's what I hired you to do, not plan fashion shows. I know, and I have some pitches set up. I just think she's incredibly talented, and we should treat her fairly. OK, Allie can have her show. Sorry to interrupt. Colin, I made something for you. You shouldn't have! It's a small thank you for your help. I... no, I'm just doing my job. OK, you... you seem a little busy, so I'll just leave it right there. Allie? I'm having a small get together tomorrow at my summer home in Monterrey. Why don't you join us? I would love to. Colin will give you the details. Absolutely! Thank you. I don't know what I'm going to wear to Marla's. Even on sale, I can't afford anything from this consignment store. You can't make your own dress? I don't have time, it's tomorrow. With designing for Cassidy, party planning... The articles you owe me? This says, I'm here at your swanky party. It needs more oomph. So you can impress Colin? Please. I need to look like I'm a design director of a major fashion brand. Is Arturo going? Marla invested in his restaurant, so maybe. This makes a statement. It says you're a lamp. You should come. I can bring a guest, Colin's email said it's going to be a wild party. I don't know, what if Arturo brings a date? Then you can interview him for his blog and stop obsessing. I am not obsessing. You're the one who always tells me to go after what I want. And you should! This is it. Let's see. No. Unless Marla adopts you, this is way above your pay grade. I wish I inherited Cassidy's closet along with her phone. I'll just try it on. No. It's a trap. Don't do it. If you do it, and it looks good, you're going to buy it no, matter what. No, I won't. I have willpower. Cassidy, I know you're reading these. We need to talk. TG, Cassidy's... Oh, why did I not charge it? I hate new phones. Doesn't sound like a wild party. Earplugs. Just in case. Did Colin say it was a wild party, or a white party? Wow, you look amazing. Thanks, I guess we didn't get the "everyone wear white" memo. I'm coming from a polka-dot party. Ah, welcome. Allie, thanks for coming. Marla, this is my friend Kendra. Sorry about the dress code violation, all my white clothes are at the dry cleaner. If there's tomato sauce within a five mile radius, it'll find my white shirts. No worries, just have fun. Kendra, what do you do? I run Kenya's Runway. It's a fashion blog, and I cannot wait to cover Allie's fashion sh... Shenanigans. It's OK. Marla approved the fashion show. What? Colin really believes in you. Well, I should go say hi to Arturo. Nice meeting you, Kendra. Arturo is here. How are the kids? That's code for, is there anything in my teeth? You're good. OK. Does she like Arturo? Because he's single. I can tell him she's interested. She'd kill me, and she listens to true crime podcasts, so she knows how to get away with it. I can't believe I didn't wear white. A designer making a fashion faux pas? Marla cares more about your talent than some silly dress code. Besides, you're the real deal. I wore the shirt you made me. It's my new your favorite shirt. I wasn't sure if you'd like it. Are you kidding, I love it. No one's ever designed a shirt for me before. Why isn't anyone dancing? Ugh, no one ever dances of these things. Do you know how to salsa? Nope! So, I feel like we've met before. Yes, at the restaurant. No, I mean before that. I think I'd remember. Should we rescue them? Yeah. Ooh! Oh, never mind! I learned this at summer camp. So did I! This might be a great party after all! Champagne? Oh, thank you. For sure, something. Cheers. Cheers. Hey, you guys seen Kendra? Marla was talking my ear off about menu changes. Kendra had a trunk show to cover tomorrow morning, so she took off. I'm heading out, too. Ciao. See ya. This is the best party I've ever been to in my life. Well, you have never been to one of Marla's yacht parties. I've never been on a yacht, but I've listened to yacht rock, so that counts. So, I have a confession to make. I actually know how to salsa. Passably. So you were just wanting me to look silly on the dance floor? No, you didn't look silly. You looked like you were having the best time ever. Well, it was fun to let loose for a change. If you like, I can teach you some dance moves. Sure. Play salsa music. OK. So, three steps. Dun dun dun. Pause on four. Dun dun dun. Just... just follow my lead. I'll get the hang of it. OK. Five, six, seven, eight. Yeah! So, when I first tried this shirt on, I think I finally understand why you love fashion. When I'm wearing it, I just feel more creative. Fashion is about self-expression. It's telling the world who you are. It's the tailored suit that says you can do the job, the leather motorcycle jacket that says you're effortlessly cool, and the flirty dress. When you want to flirt? No comment. So, when I was in tech, I was a t-shirt and jeans guy. Now I wear suits every day. It's just not me. Do you miss your old life? Sometimes. I mean, when you're a startup, you're always looking for funding. When you're the money guy, no one wants to hear your ideas. Except you. Cassidy didn't want your input? Definitely not. I don't think she'd want mine, either. Why not? You're both artists. Her life is all about glamour. The average person can't afford her designs. I think everyone should be able to look amazing. So, if you're Marla's tech guy, how did you end up investing in fashion? Ah, I met Cassidy through Arturo. She was doing the costumes for his cooking show, and when I saw her designs, I was blown away. So you do have an eye for fashion. I can spot someone who is passionate about what they do, someone who puts their heart into it. And you see that in me? Well, I mean, you're working so hard to save a company that's not yours, to help people you don't even know, so, yeah, I think you love what you do. And now, you know how to salsa. Kind of. Well, it's late, and it takes a while to drive back to the city. I have a meeting with our caterer tomorrow morning for our launch party. Thanks for the dance lesson. Have a good night. You, too. Mine looks like a clock with wings. Mine looks like a foot with seven toes. So, what happened with you and Arturo? That was quite the spicy salsa. Well, he took my card, but he's just being nice. By the way, Colin is totally into you. We had a moment, but it doesn't matter. We're working together. Not really. Besides, I'm designing Cassidy's clothes, my own originals, and planning this whole boutique party. I don't have time to date. I see you left out working for Kendra. I would have fired me. You're so understanding. Well, you can make it up to me. It's my turn to host the fashion blogger's. Game night I rented out game room in my building. Yay, networking. I'll definitely be there, and I can help you set up and clean up. I was, uh, thinking of asking Arturo to come. Aren't nights really busy if you own a restaurant? Exactly, so then he won't be able to make it, and it's not a date, and maybe he'll counter with a real date. That's quite the chess move. You we should ask Colin. Nah, that's crossing the line. We're supposed to be professionals. It's a game night, not a weekend in Hawaii. It doesn't get less romantic than charades. Everyone looks like a dork. Maybe. But I'll definitely be there. What can I bring? Soda. My mini fridge fits exactly one bottle. You got it. I gotta run. See you later? Mm-hm. Have fun! Thanks. Hey, Kendra! Hello! This place is starting to look amazing! Mm-hm. Hey, what do you think about having a red carpet for the opening? I think it could really elevate my designs. I love it. Hey, do you want to come to Kendra's game night? Sorry, it's so last minute. Uh, tonight? I am in. Be nice to play a game when I'm not trash talking some kid online who lives in his mom's basement. Well, there's a lot of trash talking with charades. Actually, it's trash miming. Well, with your imagination, I'm sure you're a ringer. Actually, I'm terrible at giving hints away. Oh, OK. OK. Um, two words. Book. Book? Book. Second word. Tall. Ceiling, height? Ah, oh, "Wuthering Heights"! Yes! How did you guess that? I have no idea. I... maybe you're better at this than you think. I mean, plus, it was my favorite book in high school. Mine, too. I never met a guy who liked it. I guess I'm just a fan of doomed romances. I mean, not in real life. I second that. It's the caterer. He just canceled? Who are we supposed to get last minute? Look, you don't have to do this. We can hire an event planner so you can just focus on the design. I already told Marla I'd do it. Well, designing, and party planning, and writing articles for Kendra? I don't know how you do all of this. Coffee. And I love what I do, and I want to impress people. Well, people are impressed the moment they meet you. Not if I throw a party and I don't offer any food. Huh. If only we knew a Michelin star chef. What, you think Arturo would do it? He owes me so many favors. Look, we can go there now. We can talk to him over the lunch rush. As long as we're not lead to Kendra's. If her only employee is late to her party, it will not look good to the other bloggers. OK, sure. Hey. They told me you were here. What's the big emergency, besides getting my salmon special before it sells out? Actually, we're here on business. The caterer for our launch next week dropped out. I don't really do catering. But, you'll make an exception for your friends, because everything is riding on this event? Let me put together a menu for you, on the busiest day of the week. Thanks. Allie, where are you hoping to do a buffet, or just passed hors d'ouevres? Which is better? Well, I have to check on the special, so walk with me. Bet that's better. I'll be back. Sorry. Nah, it's OK. Just gotta return a call. I think a buffet would be less intrusive during an event. Arturo, you know Cassidy fairly well? Not that well, I met her a few times. Did you ever know a "TG"? I think you may have some friends in common. I know a Tia and a Gia, but no TG. It's a guy. Thomas? It was Cassidy's boyfriend. Does Colin know him? Cassidy's pretty secret about her personal life. How do you know this? Oh, I don't. Not really, just a hunch. Probably wrong. Sorry. Looks like they need me. I'll be back with some ideas for a menu, but it could take a while. Arturo's first restaurant was this little pizza place. I used to go there every day. It's nice to have a regular hangout, makes the city feel like a neighborhood. Yeah, I came up with a business plan for my startup there. Used to write all my ideas down on napkins. Arturo let me sit there for hours. And you thanked him by investing in his restaurant empire! Ah, it wasn't an empire when we started, but I knew it would be. I mean, cooking is his life. And, any time that I got stuck on an idea, I would just build a little sugar packet house. For some reason, it helped me focus. I use a game of solitaire to clear my head, but I'll try this. I didn't knock them over! So, how long you been in San Francisco? I've been here for about a year. I decided to give designing one more chance, while I had no commitments. And did you leave anyone behind? I was still dating my high school boyfriend. He decided we were in a rut, I thought we could fix it by getting married. His solution was to break up. How could anyone be in a rut with you? You're like one of the most interesting people I know. I highly doubt that, you know Cassidy! She must be really exciting to hang out with. She's got quite the social life, from what I've read. People who do exciting things aren't always the most interesting. Well, it turns out he was right about the rut. Even though I went to fashion school, he didn't think I had what it takes to be a designer. Well, you proved him wrong. He's why I don't like roses. Any time I got mad at him, he'd send me a dozen to apologize. What about your ex? Ah, I don't really like to talk about exes on dates. So this is a date? It's a business... business date. Business. Yes. So, the... the trick is in the wrist. And in the design. Says a superstar designer. I'm so not. Well hey, they wouldn't have asked you to judge a portfolio review if you were nobody. Uh-huh. There's something I need to tell you. Good news is, I got some appetizer options ready for you. Bad news is, I need your table. We just booked a party of 20. Allie, if I could get your decisions by tonight, I could have everything ready in time. Great, I'll try these at home before we go to Kendra's! I have a better idea. I like the mini quiches and the tiny tacos. I'm a big fan of miniature food. I could eat an entire meal just made out of appetizers. Arturo and I used to joke that we were both app developers. So, I like your idea of the virtual stylist app. Yeah, just type in the event, and the app will suggest the Cassidy Clark pieces you should wear. Or, it could expand to offer other designers. I think Marla is going to want it integrated into the boutique inventory. Maybe we could add some other brands later, though. When I was little, I used to think that dandelions were real flowers. I had no idea they were weeds. Me, too. I mean, my parents used to rip them out of the front yard. How can they be bad if you can make a wish on them? What did you wish for? Ah, you know the rules. You say it out loud, it won't come true. See? I'm learning about accessories. After the boutique opens, what's my future with the company? That's a good question. I have to confess, Kendra isn't just my friend. She's my boss. This is my first actual design job. That doesn't matter. You're killing it. Well, here's the thing. If I'm going to work with Marla, I have to give up my job with Kendra. Right, is that what you wanted to tell me in the restaurant? Actually, I had... Listen, if Cassidy comes back, she's going to take back control of her line and tell Marla that you're not her design director. If she doesn't come back, Marla cuts off the cash. You could still run the boutique? I didn't move here to be a store manager. I want to design. Well, maybe your fashion show will get your name out. I'll do what I can. I bet I know what that wish was. I bet you don't. Uh-oh. What time is it? It's you're two hours late o'clock. I completely lost track of time. If you couldn't make it, you should have just texted me. I'll be right there. I have to go to Kendra's. Will you go over the menu options with Arturo? Yeah, of course. OK. Thank you. Shoot. I'll meet you there later! I'm too late? You think? I'm so sorry. Let me help. No, I can do it. I feel awful. Things took a long time at Arturo's and Colin and I had a really great talk. Uh-huh. I never want to be the bad friend who blows everything off for a guy. I don't blame you for being mad. I'm not mad, Allie. I'm just disappointed. I've been cutting you a lot of slack at work while you're working on Cassidy's line. I know, you've been the best. But I've had to do your job and mine. Well, it's just temporary I hired you because I needed help, and I don't want to replace you in case it doesn't work out. Why wouldn't it? Colin has my back. You've been doing all this work for the boutique opening, but what happens after next week? We've been too busy to talk about that. Has Marla even hinted about keeping you on? And what happens if Cassidy comes back? She might not. Then there's no Cassidy Clark label. Marla's not giving you your own line. She might when she sees what I can do. I've been covering fashion for a long time. This is usually how it works out. I thought you believed in me. I do, I'm just being realistic. I know how hard this business is, but I don't need reality right now. See you tomorrow? I got this, Clarissa. I need more hangers. Like, a ton more hangers. I got the swag, where are the bags? If your model's sick, get me a new one. I don't care what she looks like, she's a model. I'm sure she's fine. This cake says Cassidy Cluck. This is not a chicken restaurant. I need a new cake in two hours! Hey, you. Hey, you're early Thought I'd come help out. This is going to be a big success. I don't know. I hope so. I've been hashtagging Cassidy Clark boutique launch till my thumbs went numb. Listen, I'm sorry about game night. Don't worry about it. The other bloggers have fun. And thank you for turning in your article, I know you must be slammed. You have no idea. Did it make sense, or was it just random words strung together? That's what an editor is for. How can I help? Can you hang up the rest of the clothes, and then check the models in when they get here? Sure. Should I set up in the back? Sure, Arturo. I know you want to talk to him. I got this. I promise, I'll be right back. When the music starts, maybe I can give them to play some salsa. You said you learned to dance at summer camp. Yeah a little place upstate, Camp Caribou. I spent one summer there. Actually, half the summer. The year the storm took out the boys' cabin? How'd you know that? We must have been there at the same time, it wasn't very large. I don't recall an Arturo. Sorry, sorry. I have to finish setting up here. Catch you later? Arturo is acting very weird. We just realized we went to the same camp, and he just shut down. It's funny you have that in common. No, it's terrible. He must have realized what a huge dork I was, and changed his mind. That doesn't sound like him. I got to get ready still, can you? Go. Thank you. Hey, your investors are here. It's looking good, it's looking good. Great job, Allie. We're getting some excellent press! And not just from Kendra. The launch officially ends at 9:00 PM, so I was going to start the fashion show at 9:05. After the crowd settles, I want you to say a few words about the clothing line. Maybe explain that cool digital mirror. Well, Allie has got a lot to do already. It's OK, I don't have anything planned, but I can wing it. Oh, just talk about your work, your inspiration. I think I'm going to say for the fashion show, too. It's Cassidy! Is it really her? TG. Cassidy. It's her! I thought she disappeared. Hey, TG. I have missed you so much. What are you... what are you doing here? Oh, I just flew back from Nepal this morning. I couldn't miss my own boutique opening. You're TG? And, who are you? Nobody. I should get back to the party. Who is she? Never mind. I just missed you so much. Hmm. Colin is TG. Cassidy his ex. There is no way he's over her. And she's here! What's the big deal? He's into you now. I can't compete with her. She's this beautiful, successful designer. I've always had my imposter syndrome, and now I'm literally an imposter. Hey, If Colin's right for you, he won't care. OK? Hey, hey. I can explain. - You don't have to. You're TG. I should have known. How do you know who TG is? So, Cassidy. You must be jet-lagged to not recognize your own design director. I don't have a design director. Who did these? They're not yours? No. Someone tell me what's going on. I want answers. You lost the right to ask questions when you disappeared. I just needed a break. It all got to be too much. You got to answer your calls! I called you. I texted you. You never answered once. I was totally off the grid. I got rid of my phone. To do this right, I needed an electronic cleanse. Well, I'm glad you're back, Cassidy. Just in time to introduce the fall line. I thought I was going to do that. Cassidy is the face of the brand, and apparently you're not who you say you are. What about my show? I don't think so, considering you misrepresented yourself to us. Marla, that was on me. I told her to say she was design director. I couldn't have all those people lose their jobs. I trusted you, Colin. Allie, thanks for your work, but we don't need you here right now. Colin, we're going to introduce the line in a few minutes. You can fill Cassidy in. We will talk later, once the press is gone. OK. OK. Allie. Allie, I'm sorry. I should have been honest with Marla from the beginning. If it makes you feel any better, I'm probably out of a job. Does it make me feel any better? I just lost the last few weeks of my life! OK, look. We'll pay you for your time. I'll talk to Marla. She'll get you a letter of recommendation. That's not what I meant. You're TG. How do you know that I'm TG? That's... that's Cassidy's nickname for me. Only we knew that. I have Cassidy's old phone number. What? I got a new phone, and I started getting all her invitations and messages. That's how I ended up at the portfolio review, and Arturo's restaurant opening. So, you've been reading all my texts to her? You've been lying to me this whole time? I tried to tell you. You had plenty of opportunity. You're the one who lied, here. You never got over Cassidy. You were still sending her messages! Because I needed closure. She just left. We never broke up. I couldn't move on with you until I talked to her. I read the messages. You weren't ready to move on with me. Those were private. It's like you were reading my diary If I knew you were TG, I would have told you sooner. You should've been honest with me from the beginning. I liked you because I thought you were a good person, because I thought you were honest. Look, I can't be in a relationship based on a lie. What are you really doing here, Cassidy? I'm back in San Francisco? You left. You didn't say goodbye. I was checking hospitals for you. TG. You're so dramatic. If I tried to say goodbye to you, I never would have left. I needed to do this for me. I couldn't love you if I couldn't love myself. You broke my heart, and everyone at your company almost lost their jobs. I know. I'm sorry. But the good news is, I figured everything out. I missed you. We've got a lot of catching up to do. My friend Petra is letting me use her condo in London. We should have a little vacay. Vacay? From what? You've been traveling for months. Great job on the boutique opening, everyone loved the clothes. Cassidy's boutique. No one ever saw my work. Are you spying on Colin? No, it's Cassidy's social media. Arturo says the gang is back. I thought he was Team Allie. OK, spying is not healthy. Talk to Colin. Sort it out. What's the point? Because there's something special between you two. You can't just give up. You have more to offer than some self-centered party girl who doesn't have the common decency to say goodbye to those who care about her. We lied to each other. I don't know if I can get past it, and I don't think he can. Did you order soup? Chicken soup made me feel better when I was sick, maybe it'll cheer you up, too. And it's fewer calories than ice cream. I don't deserve you. But, soup isn't going to make me feel better after screwing everything up with Colin, and with work. Don't give up on yourself yet. I should've just told Marla the truth, made a case for why she should invest in my line. Do you need a pep talk? Because I feel one coming on. Please, no. Phew. Kendra, do you feel fulfilled in your job? I like what I do. Is it the dream? Maybe not. But I don't think I'm cut out to be an astronaut, either. Yeah, I'm having a crisis. Is there one between quarter life and midlife? I wish I could just hide like Cassidy. And here I am, trying to be her again. OK, your job isn't who you are. I'm not Kendra Bundy, the fashion blogger. I'm Kendra Bundy, the classic movie fan. Or the obsessive trivia buff. Or the good daughter when I remember my parents' anniversary. But how could he like me, when he could have the real Cassidy Clark? Allie, you took an impossible task and you crushed it. You can do this. You promised me no pep talks. I couldn't help myself. Allie, some dreams are worth fighting for. And some people are, too. Cleared out my office. Let's just get this over with. Actually, the boutique opening was a huge success. Cassidy's return played very well in the press, and you can tell Allie that her designs for Cassidy's line were very well received. Then I'm going out on top. You lied to me about Allie. You also lied to me about dating Cassidy. I have no other choice than to promote you. Wait, what? You've proven to me that you will stop at nothing to get the job done, and you can keep a secret. Just don't keep any more from me. I... I mean, I already cleaned my office out upstairs. Good, when construction is done, you're moving into a bigger one. Uh, then... then, I quit. Why would you do a silly thing like that? Allie helped me realize that I miss seeing my ideas come to life. I want to find the dandelions. The what, now? Dandelions. They go unnoticed. They... they're not valued like roses or tulips, but they... They're tougher than flowers, and they make the grass around them grow stronger. You know you're not making any sense? OK. Well, if you change your mind, my door is always open. You know, once they put the doors on. See you around, Marla. I called you last night. I snagged some tickets to the game. Yeah, I just wanted to lay low for a bit. Thinking about things. - Oh, yeah? Now that Cassidy's back in town, does she want you to find yourself, too? No, this one is coming from me. She wants to get back together, though. Did you tell her about Allie? There's nothing to tell, right now. You know she had Cassidy's old phone number? It's how she know about the restaurant opening. I'm glad you find this amusing. So, she wanted Cassidy's job and her boyfriend? Ex-boyfriend. And no, she didn't know it was me. But she was reading every single text that I sent Cassidy. She had the nerve to tell me that I was still hung up on her. You're interested in Allie. You're still texting your ex, who isn't even getting back to you. Yeah, I see how that might hurt her. Speaking of Allie, are these her designs, because I found a bunch of them cleaning up after the party. I... can't see Allie right now. Um, maybe you can drop them off later to Kendra? Uh, that's all right. What did you do? I thought you liked her! It's complicated. Everything's complicated. We went to the same summer camp. She'll know who I really am. So? I kind of ghosted her. She's going to think it's something that she did. You have to tell her. Yeah, you're probably right. Well you know, I do want to talk Allie, because I think these jackets would be perfect for my wait staff. What do you think? Hmm. I think I see a rabbit eating a boot. How about you? Sorry, I'm not in the mood to play today. Hey, I have a fun assignment for you. There's a fashion show tonight. Way to rub it in. It'll be fun! I promise. - As fun as Pac- - Man holding a banana? What? Hi, sweetie. I'm sending you a box of the clothes I made for the fashion show. At least someone can enjoy them. Oh, Allie. I know things didn't go your way, but it's not like you to give up. What's going on? It's Colin. He didn't tell me that Cassidy was his girlfriend. Whoa, that is a big thing not to tell you. I'm sure he has his reasons, at least give him a chance to explain. But I don't know if I can trust him anymore. He lied to me. Well, there is a difference between a secret and a lie. Did he ever deny that he was dating Cassidy? Well, no. But I didn't think to ask. I'm sure you and dad never keep secrets from each other, and surprise parties don't count. All right, here's one. When I met your father, I was engaged to someone else. What? No, I don't believe it. I knew your dad was the one the minute I met him. And after our first date, I broke off my engagement. And you never told Dad? Eventually, I did. But he knew that if I had told him the truth, there never would have been a first date, and you wouldn't exist. Does that make me a bad person? No, you're like the best person. It sounds like Colin really cares about you. Just give him a chance to explain. But I don't want to get in the way, if they're working it out. You know that she's not the right one for him. You took a risk to go after your dream. Take a chance on Colin. Thanks, mom. Interesting choice of decor. Yeah, must be a special occasion. Oh look, they have DJ JD. Who? Lawyer by day, DJ by night. Come on. So, who's the secret designer? My favorite. She has a new line coming out. What's going on? Just wait. I owed you a fashion show. I keep my word. Now you can design uniforms that don't make the waitstaff look like mimes. Then branch off to do whatever you want to do. I can work with that. And I can design an app for you, so you can sell everything online. And I have the time, since I quit my job. Congratulations? So, it, uh, looks like your plan worked. Oh, Colin's plan. My plan was to apologize to you for the other night. Oh, it's... it's OK. Let me explain. You don't remember me from camp, because my name isn't Arturo Franco. I wanted to get into Italian cuisine, so I pretended to be Italian. Wait, you're not Italian? Uh, when you knew me, I was Arthur. Artie! I do remember! Sort of. Do you remember my last name? No, just that the boys were kind of mean to you. But they were mean to everyone. I'm Arthur Frankenstein. Frankenstein? Like the monster? Like the scientist. It's a real name, but it's not a great one if you want to be a famous chef. Well, my last name is Bundy, so people think I'm related to the serial killer. So I kind of get it. You know, I still owe you dinner. Do you know a place? Uh, anywhere I don't have to cook. OK. Cassidy was my girlfriend. We met when I was in tech, so she called me TG, for "Tech Guy." But if Marla knew that we were dating, she would have thought that I recommended her based on a relationship, so I promised Cassidy I wouldn't tell. I wanted to tell you, but I couldn't betray her trust. I get that. But I don't feel that way about her anymore. Cassidy cared more about being famous than she did about the work, that's why she couldn't handle the pressure. I didn't realize how unhappy I was, until I met you. I want to create things. I want to make my own dreams happen, and those dreams include you. That barista's vest was one of my designs! And, Marla has a couple more meetings set up for us, starting with my favorite donut chain. Perfect, they can pay me in donuts. Well, something tells me our investors might object to that. I think the barista knew he was wearing my design. This is definitely a dandelion. Without a doubt. To Dandelion Designs. Except, I don't think you can actually make a wish on that one. That's OK, they've all come true.
