(1960s theme music) - [Film Narrator] I'm Lieutenant Williams, a police officer attached to the juvenile division. I'm on my way to Monroe Junior High School to talk to a group of young people. That looks innocent enough, doesn't it? Lots of young people hitch hike. Seems like a good way to get from one place to another. But sometimes there are dangers involved that never meet the eye. Let's take the case of Jimmy Barnes. Jimmy played baseball all afternoon and he didn't feel like walking home, so he decided to thumb a ride. (car passing) - [Man One] Started with a nice man who picked me up at the bus stop after school. And then I discovered places where you could go. In those days it was train, and bus stations, and movie theaters. - [Man Two] Going downtown, getting picked up from this older guy, who is actually a therapist. (laughing) And he did things to me that I didn't even know about up until that point. - [Woman One] All I knew was that something went through my body when she kissed me. (traffic) I felt all kinds of sensations I'd never felt before. And one was, first, revulsion. But right on the heels of that, I felt attraction. - [Man Three] I knew I was off track, somehow, from the boys around me. I didn't jive with them, I didn't resonate with them. - [Man Four] Four years ago, I self identified as a gay man. (vehicle breaking) (group chattering) (applauding) - [Joanne Highly] Thank you, very much. It's wonderful to be here. You know, when I mention the word homosexuality, we all have different reactions to it, don't we? I was just thinking this last week when we stood on the steps of city hall with your pastor, Pastor Joe Paterra, and we were protesting the idea of same sex marriage that this state is considering. Now, when I was a girl, I know you can't remember that far back. (laughing) But when I was a girl, there was no thought of such a thing. Same sex marriage? We wouldn't even mention anything about same sex, much less same sex marriage. But yet, when I was 13 years old I began having same sex experiences. Now, this was a shock to me. I must admit, I didn't understand why I got involved in such a thing. But I want to tell you what happened to me, personally, in my life. - I just like to ask, by a show of hands, how many of you know a family member or friend, someone in the neighborhood, who is gay? Look at that, a lot of people. So see, you can minister to them now. See, the Bible says; be the truth in love. Always in a loving, respectful way. Don't be telling em; you're gonna burn in hell. - [Audience Member] That's right. - Don't say; you're an abomination. Speak the truth in love. You can share the love of Jesus Christ with people. - See, the Bible says clearly that the testimony has the power to break Satan's... - [Richard Wagner] That's right. - Grip, if you will. - It says; by the blood of the lamb, and the word of your testimony. So, as you speak your testimony, as we're speaking the truth of God's word, it's penetrating hearts because the word of God will not return voided. It was in high school that I started to, for the first time develop same sex attraction, and I was devastated. I was like; why am I havin this? I will humiliated, I would never share with anyone. I remember praying to God; God take this away from me. Why am I, I don't want these feelings. I was repulsed by it, but strange enough, attracted to it at the same time. - [Man Five] But I was at 42nd Street House, it was part of my coming out. When I first found out that men wanted to have sex with me, once or twice, without my asking them, men gave me money. And somebody, probably on of the other kids that hung out at the train station told me that; oh yeah, if you go into New York City you can go on 42nd Street, and all the men will give you money. - They prayed over us, and I heard, I didn't hear an audible voice, but I heard a voice speak to me. And it said; you're going to minister to homosexuals and Jews. And I though to myself; well, there are plenty of both of em in New York City. So this must be where we're called. - What happened to me, is that I would go to a bar, or go to a cruising area and wait for somebody to approach me. I mean, I was not the person who did the approaching. I would wait until someone approached me. And then, make my mind up at that point, whether this is someone I would want to go with or not. Might not have been my first choice, if you will. But especially early on, there wasn't any question of choice. I mean, all I wanted to do was get my rocks off. (turn signal blinking) - Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived, neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor male prostitutes, nor homosexual offenders, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor slanderers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. And that is what some of you were. Thank God for that line, right? - [Audience] Amen. - But, you were washed, cause you were dirty, right? - [Audience Member] Yes. - You were sanctified, made holy. You were justified. - [Audience] Amen. - Brought as if you had never sinned. In the name of the Lord, Jesus Christ, and by the spirit of our God. - [Audience] Amen. - We thank God for this opportunity to be here. We have materials in the back we'd love for you to pick up, and of course, if you want us to pray with you or talk to you about friends, or about yourself, we'd be more than happy to do that. God bless you all, we love you. - When I go out, I have a street ministry now, where I go and minister to the gay community. I meet them where they're at. That's where God has put me at. And I got out and share what God has done in my life. I don't go out with condemnation. Because I was right where these people are, where they've been. But see, I can share... They connect with me 'cause I start sharing about the things in my childhood, and there's a connection. - [Bill] Right. - And see, they may think; well, I was born this way. But as I start to show them that no one's born that way. It is 100% environmental. - [Bill] Right. - I share the things in my past, they can relate with some of the things I'm saying. And that's what brings the connection. - [Bill] When you say you go where there at... - That's right. - [Bill] What does that mean? - Cruise areas on Long Island. Park and rides on Long Island where people carpool during the day, but into the city at night. They're filled with men driving around, looking to have a sexual encounter. - God keeps bringing to me, people in the lifestyle. - [Joanne] Oh. - Constantly. I'm in retail, and my heart is like, I love them. Every friend, I even have my niece is in lifestyle and I believe in God for her freedom. So I'm just hearing these testimonies, I'm totally encouraged. 'Cause I'm like... - [Joanne] That's great. - Lord, I know so many of them, they know the Lord. - Henry Savant came in once and I told him there. I told him what I was doing, he pulled up next to me. And he asked me, cause most people are in the vehicle, but I like to be outside the vehicle. And I told him, I said; I'm a minister of the gospel, and I used to come into these places. I've been delivered from homosexuality. He just looks at me; okay. - [Bill] That's a new one. (laughing) - He's like; alright. That was a new one, I don't think he ever heard it before. - [Joanne] Whatever you say. - Right, whatever you say, okay. - Maybe about the time I was 16, 17 years old. Not that I would have identified as gay, but I was allowing men to use my body for sexual satisfaction. The man who was to be my life partner, I met when I was 18. I was in a cruising area one night walking. He was in his car, he picked me up. We met, we had sex. We met again, and we met again, and then we decided that we were in love. You might find another person who's doing the same thing who you can hook up with. You might find another couple who are in the process of having sex with one another that will invite you to join them. It wasn't all the unusual of a thing, either. The way I worked is I would walk among these paths and back through the woods, here. On a nice summer day, there's quite a few men that are also walking back there. If you saw someone who you think is interesting to you, you might step into the woods and see if he follows you, or vice versa. Someone may step into the woods in front of you, and you might follow them. - [Bill] So it's mostly nonverbal? I mean the communication? - Oh absolutely, yeah, yeah. Very little conversation. In the parking lots there's a lot of conversation, but back here, there's very little conversation. When you're living the lifestyle the way I was living it, you're never quite sure whether people know or not. There was no reason to discuss it. I was never quite sure what the story was. People knew that I lived with another man. And people assumed what they wanted to assume. Whether it's healthy or not, it happens. And if that's considered unhealthy, that's unfortunate, but that's what the truth is. Absolutely, because there are, and I know a few people who swear that the whole promiscuity thing is a myth and it doesn't exist. - [Bill] Cruise and have 10 partners, did you cruise and have hundreds? I mean, is it possible? - The number would be hundreds. (birds chirping) (car honking) - One of the things that I perceive from hearing people speak who have gone to reparative therapists, people who are parts of the ex gay movement, many of the people in those who wind up seeking that treatment, I can ascertain, have had complicated lives. It's one thing to say; I have difficulty forming relationships. It's another thing to say that everybody who's gay has difficulty forming relationships. We're getting into the realm of stereotyping. So again, we get down to the specifics of the individual who seems to define their gay life in a certain sexualized way, in a certain self destructive way. And then they say; well this is what all gay people are like. I think that's rather grandiose. - [Bill] Excellent. - Okay. - [Bill] Good start. Thank you, Doctor. - Not at all, thank you. You got my blood boiling. (laughing) - [Bill] Did we? - A little bit, yeah. - I view the larger culture, mainstream America, as hoodwinked. It's the emperors new clothes. You know the story of the emperors new clothes. The emperors out naked, walking down the street and everybody has come to believe that the emperor has to have clothes on him. And no one's willing to speak up. I think our larger society has just swallowed what they've been taught in the media, as they typically do. Those who I see as fascist, are the people who say; there is one way to be, and there is one way to think. And we are the ones who are gonna tell you what that way is. And that way is, that if you have homosexual feelings, you're gay, and if you're gay, you were born that way. Despite the fact that there's really little or no evidence to suggest that, this is the way it is. And you must think that way. In fact, we are gonna pass laws to ensure that you don't think any other way. Does that not sound like Nazism? Does that not sound fascism to you? - Matheson certainly is someone that we recommend a lot of people to. In fact, David is a person I helped recruit here. Basically, 90% of his client base or Jonah Clients. My name is Arthur Goldberg. I am the co founder and co director of Jonah, which stand for Jews Offering New Alternative to Homosexuality. I'm also the president of Path, which is simply a coalition of the various secular and faith based ministries. I'm also the executive secretary of NARTH, which is the primary scientific and research arm of the movement. I'm also involved as an advisory board member of the German Institute of Youth and Society. And also on the advisory board of PFOX, and a number of other organizations. I'm very deeply involved in the movement. - But it wasn't until I was about 22, 23 that I finally put together that what I was feeling toward other men, and my masturbation fantasies, meant that I could be homosexual if I wanted to. I remember the day very clearly when I finally decided to push it. I finally thought, you know what, I'm going to actually masturbate and fantasize about a guy, fantasize that I'm having sex with a guy and let's just see what that's like. And it was exciting, it was pleasurable. At that moment, I realized I could be homosexual if I wanted to. I never felt obligated to be. Let me clarify, people are not born gay, period, end of discussion. No one is born gay anymore than anyone is born heterosexual. I'm denying the existence of gay biology, that's different. I don't deny the existence of gay identity, but I absolutely deny the existence of gay biology. - Nobody is a homosexual by identity. It is a human problem like any other human problem that people have. - The implicit belief within the gay and lesbian civil rights movement is that homosexuality is inborn, that people are born gay. By which they mean that it is immutable, meaning that they cannot change. That is something that is out there in the popular culture, on both side of the culture wars. And that is the way the argument is being framed. - [Bill] Is that where the science is? - The science, well the science is not clear. The science doesn't provide us with definitive answers at this point. The science, anybody reputable would say; there's enough science to make a convincing case that biology plays some role in the development of a sexual orientation. But what role biology plays verses what role the environment plays, that's unknown. - Well absolutely, it's part of the multicultural movement. Multicultural movement really, has got to take into consideration that religion is a very deeply felt, and for some people, unchangeable part of identity. And, if I may, in my case my religious identity trumped my sexual orientation. There was no way I was going to accept gay. It just wasn't going to happen. - [Bill] Are you straight like me? You know what I mean? - I don't know. - [Bill] I know you don't know. But you know the question. - I know what the question means. - [Bill] Okay. - And I'll give you the answer. - [Bill] Okay. - I don't care. - [Bill] Okay. - I don't need to be. I'm as straight as I need to be. In fact, I'm probably a little more straight than I need to be. (crowd chattering) - [Parade Announcer] LGBT Africanites. - Well, I think they're misguided. I think that they should just let people live the way they want to live. I guess if people are really uptight and come from areas where they can't live openly gay lifestyles, and that's what they want to do, I think that would be fine. But I don't think it would be fine for other people to tell them they have to do that. - They have no concept of what Christianity is. They wouldn't know a teaching of Christ if it hit them in the face. - [Bill] Have you ever heard of these ex gay ministries, the folks that say they can change homosexuals? - Yes. - [Bill] What do you think of those folks? - Can I curse? (laughing) - [Bill] Please. - They're full of shit. They're the biggest hypocrites on Earth, the biggest hypocrites. Because they're preaching that they could change us, and that's all publicity. That's all for them to get money, that's a load of crap. Those who criticize us, and complain about us, are the ones who really need the help, and really need the Lord, like they say. Because I'm happy with myself. - They're very misguided and they do a lot of harm, actually. - [Bill] Where do you think they're coming from? - Ignorance. Probably some of well intended from their own point of view, from what they were raised with. They don't have all the facts, and they're relying on stereotypes. (whistle blowing) (gospel music) (applauding) - I looked everywhere in the Bible for some approval of homosexuality. I didn't want it to be what it was. But, I couldn't find anything else. Every mention of homosexuality was accompanied by a stern warning, it wasn't a light one. You will not inherit the kingdom of God, is in First Corinthians, chapter six. (birds chirping) (background chattering) - My name is Peterson Toscano. I live in Hartford, Connecticut, and I identify as queer. I like the term queer because it's more than just gay to me. And I definitely identify as an ex gay survivor. I survived over 17 years, and $30,000 of my time and money in trying to change from being gay to straight. But I often have to ask the question when people say; is change possible? My question is; why is is necessary? Why is change necessary? Why isn't it just as good to say; let's be gay. (birds chirping) And if change is possible, why is it so elusive? They had Saturday night meetings at Glad Tidings Church. I was impressed in that, was like; wow, she knows what she's talking about. Because she spoke with such authority about what makes people gay, about God can change you. She had faith, and hope, and very powerful personality. If you asked me then, it would be like; well, because I'm a Christian. And that seemed to be the only answer I needed to give. Hello, I'm a Christian so I've got to repent of being gay 'cause that's wrong. But looking back, I realize this resonated with me because I had been sexually abused as a child. And I had never acknowledged that it even was abuse. So it wasn't just that I'd been sexually abused, but I just assumed I was this demon child that wanted, that enjoyed sex with adults simply because these situations were thrust upon me. And they were enjoyable. And they were terrible, all in one. And they were things I never told anybody about. (birds chirping) And so I just assumed I was a dirty, bad, perverted person. And I grew up with that sense of who I was, this nasty, perverted, spoiled person. That I was broken inside. So when I started hearing the message that Jesus can wash away all your sins, he'll make you whiter than snow, he can make you a new creature. If any man be in Christ Jesus, he is a new creature. Behold, all things have gone away. All things have been made new. For someone feeling like a piece of trash, like I was feeling, that was a powerful, powerful message. And I considered myself ex gay, and I tried very hard to be celibate. And the thing is, in the ex gay world you can have what's called a fall. Which is bad and wrong, but you repent. And it's your heart that's most important. So although there were many of us, I'd say most of us, were falling left and right almost every week, it was your heart, like; but I don't want to do this. I wanna serve God, I wanna figure out why I keep doing this. And that kept you in a place where you were safe in that community, 'cause you were a struggler. (background chattering) And sometimes it was even with people in Life Ministry I was having sex with. You couldn't tell Joanne that you kept screwing up every week unless you wanted to open yourself up to some serious ministry with her. You know, Joanne Highly, I'm not sure what sort of degree she has, but you're dealing with people in extreme trauma trying to sort out their lives and who they are, and you don't know what you're doing. You're trusting God and the Bible. Which is a lovely thing to do for certain things, but when you're dealing with psychosis and addiction, family dysfunction, or your assumptions that these things exist, you run the real risk of hurting somebody deeply. (cars passing) - Well, at the time I was in a long term relationship and my partner died. After he passed, the first thing I did was, I said; well, I'm gonna go back into the active lifestyle. I wanted to meet another person and I didn't know how to do that. And so, one of the options that was on my calendar was to go to a gay bar. So, I came here. And I came the first time and had, well, what for me was an unpleasant experience. Everyone was friendly and everything, but in terms of making a connection it was obvious that that wasn't gonna happen. I became very obvious to me, from where I was, was that the men that I was interested in weren't interested in me. - [Bill] You mean that it's that you weren't young and pretty? - Yeah. I have a button, I should have showed it to you, I have a button that says; I was once young and pretty, but I got over it. (laughing) And in trying to re evaluate my life after his death, I looked for religion. And as I looked for religion, I first went to the Catholic group called Dignity. And after, oh I guess about two years with them, maybe a little bit less than that, I discovered a group called Courage, (sirens) which is the group for men with same sex attraction that's sanctioned by the Vatican. And again now, they provide, among other things, a venue where like minded men can get together and meet for socialization and other activities. And I met a man at that very first meeting who became my mentor. He's been my mentor ever since. And one of the first things he did, is he said; I want you to come with me to a meeting at Jonah in Jersey City. There's a man named Richard Cohen who's giving a one day conference there. He's a man who has a record of converting, whatever the word is you wanna do, changing men from gay to straight. And I said; yeah, sure. That was something that was so foreign to me that I just couldn't imagine that someone could actually change their orientation from gay to straight. I believed that you could live a chaste life, but that you would ever identify otherwise, that was not on my agenda. But I went to this conference. (water sloshing) This is The Case Museum in Jersey City. It's a museum that features Jewish art. It's also a place that headquarters the Jonah organization. (footsteps walking) - [Bill] And so again, this is the room? - This is the room. - [Bill] And what happened here again? - Richard Cohen lead a one day conference. There were about 40 to 50 people in this room. I sat, about over here with my hands in my lap, scared to death, and heard people talk about what change meant in their life. - [Bill] Why were you scared to death? - Didn't know why I was here. Didn't believe that change was really possible. And this is the room where my change started. - The speakers were here, and people were set up there, on the audience. We had chairs like this, set up there in the main art gallery room. - [Bill] Okay, and the speaker was? - Speaker was Richard Cohen. - [Bill] And Richard Cohen is? - Richard Cohen is one of the leading therapists, a very controversial therapist, but one of the leading therapists in terms of healing of homosexuality. He has given up actually doing individual private practice now, and instead he basically teaches other therapists various techniques that have worked for him. He himself is a person who came out of homosexuality, probably 20, 25 years ago, I'm not sure exactly how long, and is really one of the more innovative types in terms of (phone ringing) therapy procedures that he uses, and that kind of thing. - [Film Narrator] Public restrooms can often (1960s theme music) be a hangout for the homosexual. Bobby and his friends hadn't noticed the man who had been in the restroom when they changed. And as it was later suggested, they take the shortcut under the pier. But the others preferred to take the more traveled way home. (suspenseful music) When Bobby recognized the stranger as the man in the restroom, the shortcut under the pier didn't seem like a good idea at all. (birds chirping) - Say hi to tv land. - Hi. - [Bill] How long have you been married? - 23,000 years. (laughing) And it doesn't feel like a day over 28. So simple science demonstrates that opposites attract. If you have a positive charge and a negative charge, I have actually magnets in the garage, it works really good. (laughing) - [Bill] Shall we get them? - Yeah, you want me to get it? - [Bill] Yes, please. - Actually, I was a little put off by Richard. Not because he was so extravagant and exuberant, but one of the first things he announced at the beginning of this conference was that if we had any questions, we had to address them to Arthur Goldberg. We couldn't ask him a question directly. We had to ask Arthur, and then... And I thought, this is, this guy's a little weird. - We have a south and a north, and a north and a south. What's gonna happen? - [Bill] Opposites attract. (click) - They love each other. They love it baby, they love it. Okay, let's flip this around. We got two north and two south, what's gonna happen? - [Bill] Repel. - Waa, waa, waa, waa, you know that. They just can't do it. Okay, so why is a guy attracted to a guy if opposites attract? Because he doesn't feel his guyness. He's looking to complete himself. If he felt masculine, he would say; Ew, hooking up with a guy? It's a non sequential. But, he's internally more feminine that masculine. So he needs that guy to complete him. Once you give him his sense of masculinity back, or once he gets in touch with it. He gets in touch with himself, he knows who he is, he gets other men, he knocks around, he feels good. He's internalized that paternal and fraternal sense. Hey, look at her. Cause opposite attract. (click) - [Bill] So your initial reaction to Richard was? - That he was eccentric. (laughing) - I think he was a member of the American Counseling Association until he was dismissed for unethical behavior. That's what I've heard. - [Bill] Okay. - I'm not an expert on Richard Cohen. (laughing) Well, he doesn't have to prove his theory that the cause of homosexuality is the difficulty with intimacy with other men. He simply gets to do his theory without having to prove it. This is so far out of the mainstream, it's on Mars. - [Bill] I mean, does... - Out of this world. - My Courage friends, they all; Richard Cohen, be very careful. And it's generally around his idea about touch therapy, that whole concept. And I've spoken to men that feel they've been hurt by touch therapy. I've spoken to other men that think it's the best thing that ever happened to them. (laughing) - That's the guy touch is this thing. (slapping) - [Female] That is the guy touch. - Now just, like there. - Like this? - Uh huh. - Okay. - See, what don't need to. (slapping) I'm not coming on to you, Bill. (laughing) - Is this a come on move? - No, no, but this is kind like... - Oh, that's the I'm not gay move. - Yeah, I'm not gay and let's not be too close. - Oh, I got it. - Yeah. - Okay. - Not you get to do it better with him. - Yeah. - It's just this. - Yeah. - [Female] Lots of love. - Okay. - Right. - [Female] See, girls don't have a problem with that. - [Richard] Yeah, right. Guys are afraid. - [Female] They are. - [Richard] 'Cause they've been punished for it. You're a sissy, you're a fag, you know, on the playground. - We have a rule in most of the circles that I sit in that you can only participate in male touch if there has to be at least three people in the room. The two people touching and another person. Just because psychologically you know there's somebody there but also physically, that is something gets out of hand there's somebody there to say stop. - We really don't want to have any unnecessary aggravation. And also, a lot of the men who are involved in the healing processes really are not anxious to have other people know who they are. - Alright. I gotta even push it further on this 'cause I'm curious. I mean, what are you afraid of... - I'll get you copies of that. - Okay, thank you. - You're afraid of... (bang) I was getting somewhere. You're afraid that people are gonna picket you? Or people, or what are you afraid of? - We're concerned, yeah, the gay activists certainly have, can make things difficult for people who wanna heal. This is a civil rights issue as far as we're concerned, from the viewpoint of people who are eager to make changes. - [Bill] You're not gonna sue me, right? - You're not gonna... Yeah. Actually, what I normally do, I actually have a form I should give you, but I trust you. But normally I have a form that says; I wanna see what you're quoting me as in order for my stuff to be done. - [Bill] Does anyone sign that? - Yeah. Yeah, the guy trembling before God did, and that's how I was able to make sure that he quoted me correctly. - [Bill] Huh. - Because was happened was, he took one sentence. I said; no, no, no, that's not the sentence that I want. So he took another, so we had another sentence. - [Bill] Interesting. I'm after the truth, Arthur. - No, no, I understand. I believe you. And that's why I'm, you know. - [Bill] You literally received death threats? - Literally received death threats. My family would get calls cussing out my wife and my kids, if they answered the phone. And told us; we'll burn your house down. I spoke in Manhattan one time, they said; if you stand up and speak tonight, we will shoot you. I have had my literature, which was next to me during the talks, a group of lesbians in Seattle came up to the table while I was speaking, took all my brochures and destroyed them. And after the talk I went up to one of them. I remember her name, she was Susan. I asked her her name. I said; you must be very hurt, aren't you? And she went (spitting) right in my face. So if you don't think that's a hurt puppy. - No, no. Other's have, people don't know we're here yet. That may change when this is on the air, but people don't know we're here, so we don't get any trouble. - I believe very, very strongly that this issue, in terms of the ex gay movement as it's called, is a civil rights issue. That this is an issue in which we need to give rights, and the right of patient determination, the right of freedom of choice to individuals who want to change. And I am very, very upset about the, I actually even call it almost fascistic type of mentality we have that the ex gay doesn't exist, there's no such thing as an ex gay. John Sterback, who you've interviewed, is clear example of of ex gay, someone who found it unsatisfactory to him. That the life didn't work for him. And we have many people like that. I came into contact with this in several different ways, and they're some members of my family that are involved in it with same sex attraction issues. There are friends that I have with same sex attraction issues. - [Bill] I thought this was your son, from our previous interview. - Yeah, but I usually don't talk about that publicly. I don't want to embarrass him, and we've approved for that not being on the tape. - [Bill] Okay, so who else? - That's why I said my family. - [Bill] That's what I thought. I thought we discussed your son. - Yeah, it is my son, but my son doesn't usually like to be publicly identified with the issue that much. So I try to ... - [Bill] Was it anyone else or was... - I've got some niece... I've got a cousin who's a lesbian. My wife has a couple of gay relative. So there are several in the family. (laughs) - I am a heterosexual man who struggles with same sex attraction. Well, I believe that all men are born as heterosexuals and through whatever wounds they go through, even in childhood or puberty, or as young adults, there's confusion that comes in. And that confusion results, for some men, with same sex attraction. With others it might come out as alcoholism, or wife abuse, or drug abuse, or people who just are too shy to even open their mouths some days. Four years ago I self identified as a gay man. - [Bill] You today are changed? - I have greatly diminished same sex attraction. I still have same sex attraction. Maybe I always will, but I don't lust after men. - I came out to my parents and I had suppressed who I was from the time I reached puberty, and a little before that, until I was 17 and came out, and finally at 18 to my parents. So I had gone many years trying to hide and change who I was. And the first thing my parents brang up, practically, was; why don't you try to change? Which was, to me, maddening. I was just mortified. And I said, vowed, that if I ever have an opportunity in my life, to make sure no one has to go through that humiliation again, I was gonna do something about it. And that episode has driven my activism to this day. In the process of writing my book, Anything But Straight, I went undercover, I went to big conferences, both right wing conferences and ex gay conferences. Sometimes I would go as myself. Other times I would go undercover and change up the hair a little bit, glasses. It worked for Clark Kent, figured it could work for me, right? And in the process I learned quite a bit. The ex gays go on television or talk to mainstream audiences with a big happy face and fuzzy language, but you go behind the scenes and it's a lot of talk about Satan, demons, and spiritual warfare. In fact, many, many people have been through these exorcisms where they try to extract the demon of homosexuality. They believe homosexuality, in many cases, is demonic. They love to show you, they love to talk about how change is possible, they don't want to show you how. 'Cause that turns off mainstream America because the methods go everything from the bizarre to demon extraction. (traffic passing) - One of the reasons why I pulled away from Life Ministries after a couple years was specifically after a counseling session with Joanne. And I was dealing with issues, struggling, still having problems like almost everyone in the ministry was having problems. And so I went to her for some one on one counseling, but we sat, it was so strange, we met in her apartment, which wasn't strange 'cause it was kind of an office. But for our counseling session, we went into the bedroom. (background talking) And we sat on the bed, and she started telling me her theories about how gay people become gay. And that by having sex, demons enter various parts, they enter from areas where you have sex. And that, she said we need to take those demons out of those places. (opera singing) But it was so intimate, and it was so invasive. It was so personal, and in a very personal space, her personal space, that if felt like abuse to me. And it was from that point on, I drew the line and I started not getting as involved in Life Ministries, because I felt really weirded out by the whole thing. (cars honking) - Twenty years ago I chose to quit my first high school English teaching internship when two ninth grade boys picked up on the evil, sexual desires in my heart. And they'd torment me mercilessly for sport. The afternoon I submitted my resignation I sat in my car in the parking lot of a Jacksonville, Florida mall, and I wept bitterly for my miserable, hateful existence. - Again, if your peers abused you, or made fun of you, or somehow you told yourself that you were less than a robust boy because you didn't play sports. Or, they call them kitchen window boys, have you ever heard that expression? (children playing) - [Bill] No - The boy who sits in his mother's kitchen window and looks out, and watches the other boys playing ball and wishes he was with them. It creates this longing. - In the seventh grade locker room, they've all got pubic hair. I don't have any yet. They're big and muscular, I'm not. In his mind at least. So these are biological things that could predispose this boy to feel incongruent. Or could predispose him to have difficulty affiliating with the other boys. So, father was an unpredictable, angry man. Loving sometimes, but unpredictable and angry. And there were some things that happened that really weren't his fault. For example there was a murder suicide in our neighborhood. Another father killed his family, killed himself. I transferred that onto my father. I was convinced my dad was gonna do that same thing. - Well, their pattern of therapy is entirely based on a very skewed environmental view. Most of the people who practice these treatments, first of all, they say they do know what causes homosexuality. That they know something that the rest of us don't know. Two, they also say that the biology is meaningless, and they tend to dismiss any biological contributions. Most of them, there's a couple of exceptions. And three, they say that because it is environmental, what is environmental can be changed. You inculcate in the patient, a new theory. You have to learn the patients here. This is actually true of many psycho therapies. In my field, in psychoanalysis, we have Freudians, we have Kleinians, we have Kohutians. And everybody reports cases in which the patients say things in their analysis that reflects some theoretical belief of the analyst. So everybody's theory is always being proven true in their respective literatures. (birds chirping) (car driving) - Yeah, Love In Action went a lot of different directions. I was surprised there was much less Bible and prayer than I'd ever had before in any other ex gay ministry. Life Ministry was almost all about Bible study, and prayer, and worship, and spiritual things. But Love In Action was much more based on a 12 step model. You are subject to all sorts of charlatans. It's humiliating, but the desperation was so high that you would do anything. - He never got involved with girls or anything like that. All the girls from the pub, from Manhattan mostly, they all fell in love with my son. So he didn't want to go out with them. I says; my God, she's Czechoslovakian, beautiful woman, 17 years old, a mountain of love. (laughing) I says; you can't find no likens for her? He says; well, I don't like her. I said; well, I like her. (laughing) My wife had a lot of hopes for him and he feels bad that he ain't gonna have a grandson for me. I says; you do whatever you have to do. Don't worry about nothing. Some of them, they had that kind of an idea that it had something to do with the parents. But I feel that whoever's born, whatever way they're born, is fine. Yeah, they kept telling me that he's gonna be squared away, he's fine, and he's this. And meanwhile, the instructor himself, he was off the wall himself. I don't think he every straightened himself. He said he straightened himself out, but I don't think he did. - [Bill] So you could tell that by looking at him? - Well, sure. I mean, you know, when you see a woman you get shook up when you get certain women that could shake a man up. - [Bill] Right. - But this guy didn't get shook up too fast, you know. I tell ya, I didn't really care too much for the way their system was working. You know, with the sittin down for hours and talkin, and talkin. It didn't amount to a hill of beans. They want money, but what do they want money for? If they're doing something, I see givin em whatever they want. 5,000/2,000, whatever. But why give em money for something they're not doing? So they finally told me that I was completely out of order. I says; no, I'm not out of order. You people are out of order. I mean, you taking money for something that you're not gonna do. If a zebra got stripes, you gonna take the stripes off the zebra? He was born with them stripes, and that's it. So, they didn't like me at all then. Yeah, I didn't make no big hit down there, you know. - So you go to Catholic church once a week? - Yeah, every Sunday morning. - Every Sunday morning? - Yeah. Our winter time is 8:30 mass. In the summer time it's 9:00. - She's the only woman friend that I have. I mean, I know women from church and things like that. But she's the only person I would really call a friend. (turn signal blinking) She's always been there for me. I never thought of it. It was a friendship that just grew over the years and got deeper and deeper. (wind blowing) - I saw John, and I hope it was temporary, become some ape who seemed joyful, at least on the outside, and we were kicking each other under the table and seeing the ludicrous, and mixing with people. And I saw him become very serious and solemn. And seemed to lose his joy in life. I don't know if that was because of Richard's death or because of other factors. But that is what alarmed. - She made it clear that she was concerned that I might be making a mistake. She asked me several times if I was sure about what I was doing. But also, at the same time, assured me that she would be there as a friend if I thought that I needed someone to talk to. - I was frankly afraid that if he did not succeed, he might attempt suicide. I was terrified. I thought to myself; why don't people leave other people alone? And I thought if he didn't make it, that it would be a disaster. And I worried, and I worried. I was also afraid of his becoming cultist. - [Bill] You're telling me he seemed happier back when he was gay? - Yeah. - [Bill] Okay. Fair enough. (Gospel Music) (applauding) - Can I hear an amen? - [Audience] Amen. - And everything that has breath, say hallelujah. - [Audience] Hallelujah. - One more time. - [Audience] Hallelujah. (applauding) - We must cooperate with God's grace by resisting sin with all our soul, in heart, in strength, in mind. But truly I can step into a gay bar for a drink. I'm struggling with not to cruise. Lie. - I just knew I'd been sick for a number of months. Meaning, very weak. Being in bed, sometimes having to crawl on the floor because of being so weak. Going to doctors, finding nothing's wrong with me. And yet, that they could detect, but yet still sick, weak, debilitated. And as I kept going in trying to discover what's wrong with me, 'cause I was a professional singer. My body was my instrument. Therefore, I was incapacitated. And I had a lot of time to sit and think. And God could speak to me then. And he told me some interesting things. He told me he was going to heal me. It was not an audible voice, but it knew as surely as I'm sitting here, that it was not me. And I knew it was God. The Lord was doing something in our lives that we couldn't stop. It was that he was drawing us to this apartment, in this particular location. Because he wanted us to minister to the people that he wanted to draw to him. Here, this particular area, we are called to the west side of midtown, New York City, Manhattan. - The devil roams the world 24/7 like a prowling lion seeking who he may devour. And make no mistake, he wants to devour everyone in this room. - If you read the testimonies of many ex gays you see things such as visions and voices that appear to me they need to get out of these phony ex gay therapies, and get some real, serious, professional help. Maybe a psychiatrist or a team of shrinks, but please, they need somebody to look at their disorders. We see everything from depression to possible schizophrenia. And instead of addressing the real issue they're told to blame their sexual orientation. It's quite sad, and a little bit tragic. - One of the reasons that we're still married is because of our faith. Because of our strong, spiritual grounding because God's a part of our family. Absolutely, absolutely, that's the pivot point. - I mean, the religion is me, it's in my DNA to have faith. From the time I was a little, tiny, kid. - I married a guy who was struggling with same sex attraction. I mean, after I became more educated about it, after we got married, after the whole thing started going, same sex attraction is the way that we have looked at it. That's that way I look at it. Because to identify himself as gay, or homosexual, he's not. He never has been. - Before we got married, I believed it would go away, that the same sex would kind of go away, or wouldn't really be an issue if I got married. It's not that anyone told me that, cause I hadn't talk to anybody about it. But I just kind of assumed that it would be that big of a deal, wouldn't be an issue. And so, I went into the marriage, got married, and the feelings weren't really that big of a deal for awhile. - David and I met in a film history class at Brigham Young University. He was a film major and I was a musical theater major. We were such good friends, that when he went to kiss me the first time, I was like; oh no, you're not gonna kiss me are you? And that's not really what I meant to say, but this trait in him has been a real saving grace for our marriage. And instead of being offended with that he just looked at me, and took my hand and said; well yes, is that alright with you? And I was like; sure. So he kissed me, and from there we were married very shortly after that. - I wasn't drawn to her at first. She was just kinda this interesting girl in class. And then we did an assignment together, and it was while we were doing this assignment. The assignment was to do this little skit together, this play from some 18th century, 18th century play. So we did it, and I realized that I really was interested in her. I can see that I had some degree of normal attraction toward her, but very blunted. Meaning it was semi attraction to her. I realized she was beautiful, I realized she was interesting. She was intriguing and fun, all of that. But as I look back, I realize the attraction wasn't what my male peers were probably feeling toward the girls that they were going out with. It was far less, because now, all these years later, I have a much more full heterosexual attraction. And I realize how diminished my attraction was at the time. - Yeah, he told me a year after we were married. I knew something wasn't quite right when we got married, but I knew he was the right man for me. I felt, I was really, really sure about that. I just deeply loved him, and felt deeply connected to him, and I just knew it was the right thing. But he did tell me about a year after, well, within the first year after we got married. He said that, and I just took it in. He said something like, and I don't know if this is an exact quote, like again, it's been a long time, but he said something like; I need to tell you something, and actually I was sitting on the steps going to the upper floor of the apartment. And he said... I don't know if he said; I think I'm attracted to men. Or I think I'm dealing with homosexuality. He said something like that. I think it was more like; I realize that I'm attracted to men. And, I wasn't shocked. I wasn't even necessarily surprised. - When is a good time to tell your wife that? But I found the best time I could and told her about it. I remember her crying, but it wasn't crying like; what did you do to me? It was crying compassionately. I'm sure that there was some fear and some hurt, but that's not really what she lead with in the way she responded to me. It was much more of a compassionate understanding, I want to help you. There was some fear too. But her response was really wonderful. - There has been a lot of pain. Because what causes pain is distance. Is that, really, you know. So that had been some incredibly painful times in our marriage. There was only one time in our marriage, of all the years that we've been dealing with it, not that I ever thought it was wrong, not that I thought I made a mistake, not that I ever thought that any of that was the case, but that he might actually choose... I actually, I don't know how much you want, but, I actually told him, I said; you either change this or you leave. So, I said; I can't do this. And he was upset 'cause he was like; well, what about the kids? I said; well, you'll have to tell the kids. - I mean, what I really wanted, even from the time I was, probably even at the time I was 21, 22, 23, when I first realized it, I wanted to have kids. I wanted to have a family. And then by the time I started dealing with it, six or so years later, by then I had kids. And I never wanted to do anything really, other than be their father and her husband. What would we have, another broken marriage, a wife with a heart broken, me with a heart broken. Because I would miss her. I'd never be able to make up for that. And three kids with hearts broken. Now do we need more of that in our society? - So he would say to me; I'm really attracted to this guy. And he was in a group that he was... - [Bill] He'd tell you that? - Yeah. - [Bill] Wow. - He'd tell me that. So he was really honest with me. There were times when I would just sit and take a deep breath in. And go, okay, what am I gonna hear now? - And I did a lot crazier stuff than look at pornography. And she is an unbelievably intuitive person. And she caught me without catching me. Something just told her; he's looking at pornography. And she just straight out asked me, I'm like; yeah. Does that answer the question? - Yeah see, that's their judgment. He suppressed it. But I can tell you from experience, if my husband was suppressing it, I would know. I would know if he suppressed it long enough, I would know. - I can so deeply understand why a gay person is gay. I can so easily and completely understand that choice. - [Bill] 'Cause you can relate? - Huh? - [Bill] 'Cause you can relate? - I can absolutely relate. I understand the choice. I can even understand why a person from a religious background would choose homosexuality over their religion. I can understand that. A slightly different personality, I might have gone there. I'm glad I didn't because the rewards of where I am now are really high. I'm very happy with where I am. - Well honestly, because... From my perspective... He's grown so spiritually connected to God. A lot of our years being married have been me being the spiritually strong one. And saying whatever. And he's now really stepped into that more and more. He really, I see him initiating, I see him seeking out God more. I see him really connected spiritually. And really connected to the core of who he is. - The term I have to use is ego dystonic. Ego dystonic means against the ego, or against the sense of self. Or, in other words, a behavior that does not resonate with who you see yourself as being. I've always been ego dystonic about homosexuality. So even though the feelings that sometimes have been very, very strong to the point I was ready to give into it, I don't know what saved me, even with that, it was always ego dystonic. It always felt like this is not who I am. After being in this process, after working on myself for 16 years, I'm sexually attracted to my wife still. I have been for a long time. And there is almost a... I don't know if you'd call it fortunate or unfortunate thing that I've discovered, which is that I'm attracted to other women as well. I'm like any other guy who has to watch his eyes when he goes down the street because sometimes women dress in a way that's provocative, and I'm attracted to them too. - The very existence of ex gays does put the question of gay identity up for debate, which it shouldn't be. And to me, this is as absurd as an African American using skin bleaching saying that he's an ex African American. Any culture, any place we have seen a minority oppressed for who they are, people have tried to change. When Jews have been oppressed, many convert. In places today, like the Dominican Republic, we still see hair straightening, and skin bleaching. It's very prevalent. And we also have seen it in a variety of other areas, such as eye rounding for Asians in areas where its advantageous. This is no different. This is the latest version of people trying to change to fit in to be accepted in society. - I chopped all that down yesterday. - We're gonna go to the grave together. He's not gonna go to any other place, no. There's no question. (laughing) We're gonna hold hands, and we're gonna go together up and down. He's gonna be on top of me. (laughing) No, no one is gonna be between us, no. - [Bill] I think I just found the sound bite. (laughing) - Even if anybody is coming after him, I'm gonna say; no, he's mine. No way. - [Bill] He might think, but it aint gonna happen. (laughing) - He might think? No, he doesn't think. I know if he thinks or not, no he's not. - What happened then, is I joined a religious community. And for the next nine years I became celibate. I was celibate for nine years. - [Bill] This is the Unification Church. - Mmmhmm, correct. And I thought if I was a good Christian boy, and follow God, and study his word, and serve other people, that's what I was taught, it will go away. Well, I did, and it didn't. And then I met my wife. We actually knew each other for many, many years. We got married, and that's when the peanut butter hit the fan. - It was wonderful, it's mass wedding. It's a lot of people together. - [Bill] Where was that? - In New York. - [Bill] Do you remember where? - Madison Square Garden. I don't understand why you get into this. I wanted to say; kinda stop. - [Bill] That's alright. I mean, you offered her, I thought we were talking. - [Richard Cohen] No, I understand, but... It's not about our faith in church cause that's in our past. - [Bill] It's about your history. - Yeah, but you get into it so deep. It was almost like a cut, I don't wanna talk about it. - [Bill] It is context. - Actually, you don't need to actually put that in. - [Bill] Just one more question about that period of time, if you promise not to walk away. - It's my right. - [Bill] It's your right, absolutely. (laughing) He's even written that he was so out of control, he thought about killing you. - [Richard Cohen] No. - [Bill] You didn't write that? - [Richard Cohen] No. - [Bill] Do I have to find the quote? - [Richard Cohen] Yes. - [Bill] Okay. You did not write that? - [Richard Cohen] Never, no. - [Bill] Okay. - [Richard Cohen] 'Cause I didn't think that. - [Bill] Okay. (Laughing) You did describe yourself as a rageaholic. - [Richard Cohen] Yeah, like my dad. - It's like Beauty and the Beast type of thing. It was really, really difficult for me. - And I did a show down with God. And I sat there for about an hour or two, very quiet. And then finally a voice spoke to me. And it was crystal clear, 'cause I asked for it; would you please repeat that? (laughing) I wanted to make sure I didn't concoct it in my own head. And it was very clear. Move to Seattle, cause we were living in Manhattan. I lived there 12 years. And I had my wife and two kids at the time. Move to Seattle, get help for your marriage, get an education, and reach out and help other people. - [Bill] Such... - Boring, I'm not. - [Bill] No, boring you're not. Such specific instructions from God, and I mean, move to Seattle. - Well hey, Noah, look at Noah. Talk about specific. - [Bill] Okay. - I mean, that boat, man. He got every measurement. That was a little more specific. - [Bill] More specific than Seattle. - Right. (laughing) - All I know is they were wonderful with us. They helped us with individual, couple, and family counseling. They were wonderful. And they helped, as my wife said, they helped us just beautifully. We saw no impropriety when we were there. We were not privy to any of that. We had no knowledge of that. It was a wonderful, healing, educational experience for all of us. - They're all counselors. And anytime we turn around, they can tell us what was wrong or how to help with holding. I've been held a lot, with clothes on. Not taking clothes off, no, no. - [Bill] No sex, no naked sex therapy? - I don't know what they doing by themselves. No, I don't think so. No, I never saw. But a lot of holding, just a little grieving. So, I grieved a lot. - When I was going through my healing process, initially, before I got there, 'cause I had gone through it before I got there. I wouldn't have had to go through all the things I didn't want to do. But I was looking for men who would put their arms around me. I didn't want sex. And I went from person to person, not only in Unification. I went to other ministries in the area. They all thought I was crazy, with twenty heads, because I wanted to be held. I'm a very kinesthetic, demonstrative man. And I deserved it. And I wanted it. And my soul needed it. So I finally found it, as I told you, with some straight guy who was willing to hold me as I grieved, and heaved, and shoveled out years of pain that I had kept in since I was a child. I saw it naturally happening there, with men, big burly guys who work in the fields everyday. They were just so willing to put their arms around a guy. And that was wonderful. And that's what I'd been teaching ever since. William Reich, he was a descendant of Freud and Jung. And Reich branched out. And Reich started realizing that the body was a repository for all archaic emotions. Feelings buried alive never die. They get frozen in this cellular structure of our physiology. So all our history's in our body. In bio energetic, you get into the body. It's a body centered therapy. And in doing it, you access these repressed memories. When I was in therapy, that's when I found out about sex abuse. I was beating the crap out of my mother, actually, and then all of the sudden, I mean, you know, symbolically, (laughing) I was beating the crap out of mom in the therapy sessions through the bio energetic, and all of the sudden a penis starting coming right at my face. It was like; (soaring noise), it was a flashback. And it just floored me. So I found out the efficacy of bio energetics. - You can tell them (punching noises) you always know loving of the people who desire to change. - One more thing, and then I'll finish. If you want visual aids. - [Female] Yeah, he's got more visual aids. - [Bill] Oh, excellent. - [Female] We shouldn't stop him from doing that. - This is what the key, I figured out. These are same sex attractions, okay? People try to pray them away. People try to get rid of them, whatever. Repressed them. Go away, go away, go away. I hate you, I hate you, I hate you. Or, now people are loving you, loving you, embracing it, and living it. To me that only adds more walls of layers of hurt and wounds. How one can get rid of these unwanted desires. There's a trick. (laughing) there's a trick. I'm not a good magician. But what I found is (laughing) the wound is connected to the desire. As soon as you grieve the wound of what created it, the desire goes away. And I'll show you the trick. How that happens, is there's a whole here. (laughing) - [Bill] Okay. - It's amusing if it weren't so obnoxious and offensive. He was the president of Parents and Friends of Ex Gays. He was a NARTH trainer. These big organizations that are trying to pass anti gay laws and try to getting into the schools. He was a central part of them. So this isn't some obscure quack that we plucked out of the swamp somewhere and made a fool of. No, this is somebody who is integral. - When I started doing psychiatry in 1960, it was very common for gay men, particularly men, to be patients with a goal of wanting to change and become heterosexual. The 1973 decision was regarded by the gay community as the best thing that had happened to them in years. I met these gay activists, and they told me what it meant to be gay in American society, and I was motivated to be helpful, there's no doubt about that. And the definition of mental disorder that I came up with, in some way facilitated arguing that it was not a mental disorder. So if you're asking; was it pure science, not it was not. So it's not true that there was no new information. There were new studies which showed that there were a large number of gays who were not dissatisfied with being gay, and who were functioning quite well. The purpose of this study, one has to understand the context. The context is that the gay community says there are ex gays, but if you really interview them and find out what they mean by change, you'll find that they don't really change their sexual feelings. What they change is the way they identify themselves. So, they may come to the conclusion; I'm really heterosexual because God makes me heterosexual, but I still have these feelings. So the purpose of the study was to see, are there a sizable number of people for whom it's not true they only change the way they label themselves, but they actually change their core sexual orientation feelings. That is what arouses them, what fantasies they have. - The reputation of the study has nothing to do with the science. The reputation has to do with the personality of the scientist. That is, this is a man who is a well regarded scientist. Who, in this particular instance, he's not a sex researcher, decided to invest his personal reputation in this particular project. And that's really the basis of all the interest in the subject, not the science of the study, but Spitzer himself is the story. - What we found is that most of the subjects gave very credible accounts of changing not only the way they labeled themselves, but their core sexual feelings. The amount of change varied for different subjects. Most of the subjects made major changes. It was a minority that claimed they have made a complete switch, I think it was only 11%. - Therapies can enlarge peoples, in some cases, can enlarge some people's capacities for sexual function. That is a possibility. But, how often it can do that, can everybody who walks in the door get that? I don't think so. - Do I believe, for the record, do I believe people can go from gay to straight? No. Do I think if there's some remote possibility that, and I'm wrong, it certainly doesn't come to these ex gay programs. - You see this huge billboard in your town that says; I questioned homosexuality, change is possible. Well the change that you're thinking of is not two fives for a ten. (chattering) - [Joanne] Did anybody see Lance? Where'd he go? Lance! Is Lance downstairs? - [Male] Joanne? - [Joanne] Yeah? - [Male] Lance is in the restroom. - [Joanne] Oh, okay. Alright, let's try this then. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. (phone ringing) We're missing seven. - [Woman] Here's one, here's one. - That's good. We know that Ty is gonna be late. We've always had a Christmas party every year. The first year was in our apartment. We just had a Christmas tree, and our ministry had just begun. - We call it, really, or we believe, because other's have said it, that it is probably the best Christian Christmas party in the city of New York. (piano playing) (singing) - The message essentially is how I got free from homosexuality. That's basically it. (singing) - And I was still struggling, not only with homosexuality, but also with pornography. And in my lifestyle, I never accepted in my mind or in my heart, that I was gay. (singing) - It was hard for me to believe. When you first hear the voice of God it's a shock, I'd guess you'd say. And many times you don't want to believe it. But, I was so hungry to get well, that when he said he would heal me, I was excited. But, the thing that happened after that, was I seemed to get worse and worse. And soon, I was feeling so sick that I asked God to take me. I thought it was time for me to die. One day I was working out in the yard, I love to garden, and I remember Ron saying to me; Joanne, let's go to church, they're having a prayer meeting. And this voice came out of me that I knew wasn't me. It just said; no! I thought; that's strange. I never had such a strong feeling against going to church. And yet, he took me there. And after that, it was a morning prayer meeting, after that the pastor met with us in his study. And I began to tell him about my former lesbianism, and that I'd been very sick, and that I didn't know what to do. (singing) - God does not make gay people. I am sorry, you can quote that. And I know that's gonna get a lot of people upset. I really don't believe that. I believe, what a cruel God that would be if he says that no homosexual will enter the kingdom of Heaven, if he doesn't allow a way out. - It was right after that that he prayer deliverance over me. And I didn't even know that Christians had demons. I was quite shocked. But I knew something had reared it's head that day when I said no to going to the prayer meeting. But also, it got more intense because I was dressed fully, as I thought, ruling prima donna of the Kansas City Lyric Opera should dress. And all of the sudden, when he began to pray for me, I was just sitting in a chair, I found myself down on the floor. I felt a scream come out of my mouth that I knew wasn't me. And then he began to cast these spirits out of me, these demonic spirits. And I knew they came out. I felt them come out. And then afterward I felt very shaky inside, like, I used to describe it like a wet dog. - [Bill] What did that feel like? Did it feel like a physical catharsis? I mean, where you... - [Joanne] Yes. And when I had cast demons out of people, I have seen clearly that people always say they feel lighter. Many times, when you're casting out demons, they will talk back. They will talk through the person. Something like; you can't cast us out. We're in here, and you can't get to us. So, there's no reason to converse with demons (singing) cause they're liars, and they'll say a lot of things just to try to trip you up. - [Bill] And what does it sound like? - Sometimes like growling, sometimes just like... All kinds of things, screaming, different voices. I've worked with people who've been in Satanic ritual problems and all kinds of voices will come out according to the different personalities. Basically, homosexuality is not natural because it is not the created design that God ordained for sexuality. We believe it's a demonic counterfeit for God's created design. It parodies it, if you will. And causes sickness, causes death, does not bring what God says sexuality should bring. You know, Godly offspring. I pray for every person here tonight (piano music) and for every person who ever walked through the door of Life Ministry in all these years, Lord. That there will be something, something, that would break through the darkness. Something that would say to them; yes, you can be free. Yes, you can be pure. - [Audience] Yes, - As if you had never sinned. By the blood of Jesus, by the power of almighty God. - ♪ Hair must be in place, ♪ ♪ Must have a perfect body, perfect smile, perfect face, ♪ ♪ Living in a perfect state to the inth degree, ♪ ♪ There's only one thing wrong with that ♪ ♪ This person isn't me. ♪ (laughing) (applauding) (singing) - ♪ I'm too full of the future, and I'm too full of the past ♪ ♪ I'm too full of my feelings and the shadow that I cast. ♪ ♪ I'm too full of rejection, failure, power to success, ♪ ♪ It seems I might identify with fear, I must confess. ♪ (singing) - ♪ I have to make you feel good, I really have to please. ♪ (group singing) ♪ Serving God with all our heart, the promise that we're in. ♪ (Applauding) - And after I came to my senses and ultimately came out, I had this huge struggle over my faith. What do I do with Jesus? And it was hard for me to go to a traditional church with a preacher, and a pulpit, because it just gave me flashbacks to those abusive days and churches. Yeah, I used to live on 81st, between Columbus and Amsterdam. This is one of my favorite spots, going to Shakespeare in the Park, going to the castle. Yeah, I love this. Of course, it's dangerous too. Because there's a gay part. At least there used to be. - [Bill] Yeah, The Ramble. - And so, we were always like, warned, don't go to The Ramble. I didn't find out about it until I was warned about it. Which (laughing) you learn more crap about this sort of stuff by sitting with the ex gays than if you actually just lived your life. And my first shot of a play was gonna be just monologue of just me talking without the comedy. And it was so horribly depressing. I was like; I can't do this to anybody. And I realized that in the comedy, and in the characters, I can tease out stuff that's just too hard to handle directly. I mean, some of the pain is so unbelievable that you have to be laughing through it to really get it. And that's the power of comedy. That you can get to those places through comedy. (children playing) I think the bottom line, what I'm getting at, is that the greatest sin on the planet is when we're inauthentic. That's the greatest sin to ourselves, the greatest sin to society, the greatest sin before God, is when we're not being true. Do you say; well, I have these problems because I'm gay, which is a lot easier to say than; I have these problems cause I was horribly, viciously abused when I was young. I was victimized, I was powerless. Instead you blame yourself and your own desires, and say; aw, it's my fault, I'm gay, and that's why I have all these problems in my life. I didn't want to do something that was simply gonna bash ex gay ministries, but rather something that was gonna be proactive. And that's when we decided to do the Ex Gay Survivors Conference. It is primarily about public awareness and education. If dialogue occurs as a result of that, that's really good. But, the reality is, it's gotta get into the mainstream that there are dangers to these programs. It's about identity, and it's about being an individual, something that is both prized and feared in the United States. We always talk about; oh, we have to be individual, individual. But as soon as someone is an individual, they are often punished for it. (water flowing) I was accepted as a queer person, that was awesome. My spirituality and my faith in Jesus was accepted, but also, so much of my other beliefs in the world, how I'm really very much against war, and I'm very much against any sorts of violence, even against animals and such, and it all clicked together in a really nice way here. So I felt; hey, I can be gay and Christian, and politically minded, and it all works together. (1960s Theme Music) - [Film Narrator] The decision is always yours, and your whole future may depend on making the right one. So no matter where you meet a stranger, be careful if they are too friendly. If they try to win your confidence too quickly, and if they become overly personal. One never knows when the homosexual is about. He may appear normal, and it may be too late when you discover he is mentally ill. So keep with your group, and don't go off alone with strangers unless you have the permission of your parents or teacher. - George Foreman is here. Blue October is coming up. Our next guest is a controversial psychotherapist who believes he can make any gay person straight. If effective, his methods could bring the show tune industry to it's knees. (laughing) His book is called Coming Out Straight. Please welcome sexual reorientation specialist, Richard Cohen. (upbeat music) (applause) - Richard Cohen is very important cause he's entertaining, which makes him a media icon. He's been on the biggest shows on television. More people have seen his tale of change and his methods, than any other ex gay leader with the exception of maybe Allen Chambers, the head of Exodus International. That exposure, on national television makes him a big player. It makes people go to his website from across the world when they want help going from gay to straight. Based on that alone, he might be the most prominent, famous ex gay leader in the world today. - [Bill] You're an ex gay success story, right? I mean, that's fair to say? - I think that's fair to say. So as long as we're saying I'm an ex gay success story, and that doesn't mean that I'm healed, that's a fair statement. - If in his heart, he's fulfilled... The goal is to help each client fulfill their dreams. It's not what we want for them. Otherwise that's not therapy, that's dictation. Dictatorial living. So John, his passion is to be straight, and now he wants to date. And we were coaching him a bit in our last session about that as he was asking for help. - Richard is running a four session training program for people who wanna know more about his work and who, at the end of this work, might be qualified to be called counselors in continuing the work. One of the things Richard talks about doing is people who get this accreditation from him will be listed on his website as life coaches or sexual reorientation coaches, whatever he wants to call that. - Well he's now participating in my counselor training program. I started last year, last year I terminated my private practice in order to train more professionals. So I did it for 17 years. He cannot be a licensed counselor, that's correct. - [Bill] Correct, he cannot be a licensed counselor. He cannot engage in therapy. - That's correct. - [Bill] Okay. But he can be a life coach because there's not right out law. - He can be a sexual reorientation coach. - [Bill] What you said the first time. (laughing) - And the second, and the third. - [Bill] And the second and the third. (laughing) - And I shall continue. - [Bill] Your expulsion from the American Counseling Association. - Which I'm very proud of. - [Bill] Well, why are you proud of that? - (sighing) (phone rings) Oh, because I saved by the bell. (laughing) - [Bill] Your expulsion from The American Counseling Association. - Right. - [Bill] Okay, you essentially... - [Richard] It's a smoke screen, Bill. - [Bill] Well, we have to get through the smoke screen. - [Richard] Okay, I don't want to comment any further on this. You can go over point by point. I will read you the letter. I'm gonna read you the letter. So you don't even have your facts straight, Bill. - [Bill] You have the letter right there? - Yes. - [Bill] Could I see it? - It's in 2002. When did I terminate counseling, Bill? I started last year, last year I terminated my private practice. Are they a licensing organization? - [Bill] No. They are a professional association. - Right, so they have no... - [Bill] The licensing board handles licensing for all health professionals. - So they have no jurisdiction over anything. - [Bill] Correct. - Yeah. - [Bill] But they have professional guidelines that are adopted by the association. - [Richard] Okay, I wouldn't want to comment anymore on this. - [Bill] Okay. - [Richard] So if you want to keep going on it, I'm done. - It's the lie I tell myself. I tell myself; I can look at this today and I'm not gonna... - [Bill] You can look at gay pornography? - I can look at gay pornography and nothing's gonna happen. And you know what, sometimes I can look at it, one day, two days, three days. But sooner or later, if I continue to look at it, somewhere in the back of my mind I know, the very first time that I look at it, somewhere in the very back of my mind I know I'm gonna masturbate. And I try to convince myself I'm not, but again, that's the lie I tell myself. - [Bill] This is about being fair to you. - I answered you. I don't want to talk about it anymore. - [Bill] Okay. Can we talk about the training you're doing with John, which you charge... - (Richard) We already did. - [Bill] You charge people like John money for that training. If you are a member of the American Counseling Association that would be another violation. (laughing) - [Richard] It's not important. - [Bill] It is because you were kicked out of the American Counseling.... - [Richard] But I don't care, I don't care. It's just like the Unification Church. You wanna make a deal out of that, and I don't. - I wanna be happy, I don't want to be lonely. If someone came into my life that I could spend the rest of my life with, and lead a chaste life, whether that's as a married man leading a healthy married life, or I suppose the possibility is still there that another man could come into my life and I could have a chaste relationship with him. I haven't met any of those people, so. But if we're talking fantasy here, I don't wanna be lonely. I don't want to die a lonely old man. - [Bill] Instead of walk up and down out of the camera shot. - [Richard] Well, what is gonna help me to help you. - [Bill] Sit down and talk to me. Sit down and talk to me. - Okay. - [Bill] 'Cause I'm here to be fair to ya. So you don't agree that homosexuals are predisposed to pedophilia? Which is Paul Cameron's point. - No. That homosexuals are predisposed to pedophilia? - [Bill] Yeah, that homosexuals are pedophiles. - Some are, and heterosexuals are too. - [Bill] Okay - [Richard] The majority are heterosexuals. Well it's ratio of population, I don't know. - [Bill] Okay, I understand what you're saying. - [Richard] I don't know about Paul Cameron much. - [Bill] Okay, so you do not support the argument that homosexuals are disproportionately predisposed to pedophilia? - I don't know the statistics on that. - [Bill] Okay. For allegedly pressuring clients to give you money. - (sighing) Are you taping all this? - [Bill] Yeah, absolutely. - Okay. - [Bill] We can move on. Because I don't want this to get to a point where we can't discuss the other material. You alright? - No. - [Bill] What's the matter? - I didn't like all that. You kept going on and on, and on. It was your agenda. It's your agenda. - [Bill] And my agenda is the facts. - Your interpretation of words. So if you can... - [Bill] Next subject, next subject. - Okay. - [Bill] Let's talk about bio energetics. - I don't wanna comment on it, no. (laughing) - [Bill] Before we came down here, Richard. - I don't think I wanna... - [Bill] You called me. - Yeah. - [Bill] And you said that you asked us not to show some video tape of bio energetics that we had taken. - Yeah. I'm done with the interview. Thank you. Sorry, Bill. - Homophobia is a made up term that was made up about 10 or 12 years ago as a way to make the average American feel guilty. - I have clients that come here from London, I have clients that drive nine hours to see me. Clients that call from all over. We have a client from Jicarda, a client from Turkey. I've had clients from Iceland, from England. Because there's just no one out there doing it because it's politically incorrect. - And they took over. They put their faces in the faces of the people and they said; how dare you! And they said; we're gonna kill you! You f'ing this and that. We're queer, we're here, you better get used to it! And stop treating us like second class citizens. - [Female] Do you think Richard's completely healed? Cohen? - No. - [Female] No. Have you met anyone that's completely healed? - No. - Well, we have seen that if there is demonic oppression in a household, many times the children could possibly be involved in incest. - Yeah, basically you have to become a white anglo saxon and conservative, born again, evangelical, republican, Christian. And pretty much every ex gay I met if it didn't start out that way, they pretty much end that way. - [Bill] What would you say to the folks who run these reparative therapy programs that think they can change homosexuals? (whistle blowing) (laughing) (chattering) (whistle blowing) (typing)
