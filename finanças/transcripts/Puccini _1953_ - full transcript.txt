Subtitles by Nostromo I saw you trying to slip by me Good morning Very pleased to see you I was afraid to disturb you so early -But in little,no time.. -Why are you leaving me now? What about the money I laid up for renting the piano,eh? Don't worry,it'll all be settled today Can you hear we settle today? When Signor Puccini's wins this prize,his operas will be for distribution For six months you've been calling me with that same story Then when we have the contract will be leaving this pigsty But you'll be happy clucking with the other chickens Musicians, I'll turn them out him and his soprano -Wait for me -Come now,Cristina I didn't know you were a fighter When it is for Giacomo Wait a minute you think it's certain -I'm going to win it -Oh of course you will -Everybody I spoke to at the Opera says -You're the only good one -And I ought to know -And the thing we celebrate,eh? I propose a banquet tonight at Sardini The Patron will never pay the pawnshop Don't worry I'll have enough to get your violin out You return those ten liras to me now Of course I will, money from the piano money for the apartment and the rest will be enough for celebration Off we go friends,Milano is ours And you,what would you ask of Giacomo? Oh what do I think? One day I asked if we might visit Lake Como but he forgot about it Where's the coffee? Today is a big day Here's the prize winner Give him something extra-special Wasn't Giacomo to have waited there until the prize winner was named? Here he is I think we'd better go outside Come on, come on ,come Hurry,hurry they seem they are posting the names What do you feel like Giacomo I've been thinking of the new life that's ahead of me Everything that went before in the past Oh,I'm so happy but I'm afraid Why afraid? You keep remembering her What do you know about her? I can't understand it And yet Giacomo's music is certainly finer Also with your libretto but that's unimportant,Fontana People like us never have a chance in ten years I never won one single contest But I was so sure I was with him every minute he was working on that opera I'll find someone for one sure Please,don't give up hope,Christina -Tonight there's a ball at the De Carlo -Yes Try and convince him to be there and I'll get invitations for all of us All right we're wasting time until tonight then And you're Maestro Puccini? Yes,that's right Puccini, our young Fontana has spoken to me of your case Very interesting,of course, my dear young fellow As for the verdict you know better than I These judgments are beyond appeal The regulations beyond question I'm very curious, Signor Puccini How does it come to you,your inspiration? Are you trying to make a fool of me,Sir? Oh,but not at all That's a legitimate question, if you're really an artist Very well, it's probably too personal But I smoke more than is good for me Pity you didn't submit that with your opera For the Commission would have been pleased to donate a carton of cigarettes Be careful about whom you're joking -We may be in the house of a countess -But don't start Giacomo -Leave me alone -Calm yourself he was only making a joke I won't permit jokes for eight months of work 10 years of hoping and lost Maybe it's funny for you but it's not for me My friend said that some of you might be able to help me But all you can do is look down your noses and laugh because of my rented suit I am a clown Yes,my poverty is funny to you isn't it,Countess? I don't belong here do I? It's funny isn't it? And for that reason my music isn't worth anything I'll show you Here is my music I'm sorry I had no idea Quiet,just a moment,a moment If the opinion of our Arrigo Boito is worth anything today I want the Commission to be made aware of what it is overlooked I beg you for your support because this opera should be presented Wait a moment,Cristina where are you going? Tonight we all celebrate No,no it's better if I go Giacomo won't miss my not coming It's a month that he's been avoiding us But you know how he forgets everything when he's concentrating on his music The Opera had to be rehearsed and perfected,come back please No,no I'm sure that he too prefer it like this Tomorrow I leave for Bergamo I have a small engagement there But no, wanting to go away like this without even seeing him I'll write him a letter Goodbye Gianni You're the only one who ever worried about me,thank you Yes 15 now Well,Sir,do you want to keep on going? Yes,drive to the corner and back again "Ever been it,back and forth, up and down",I understand Keep moving Stop it,stop Say,say,did they seem like they were hissing in there? What's that? No,that was the train the 1048 you just relax about your music now Don't all new composers ride with me because I bring you luck That Giuseppe Verdi,you know He was even more nervous than you were for his first performance Giacomo Fontana,here,what is it? Hurry up the audience is nearest going wild How much do I owe you? What's the hurry? You got plenty of time to pay Quick,the Ricordi publisher wants to see you Dearest Giacomo When you read this letter I shall be far away from Milan and all that meant to us I had hoped one day I would share your success just as I shared your hardships and struggles But tonight there's a new road opening for you There is no place left in your life for me When you dreamt of a success it was always with her in mind So your first step will be to your home in Lucca And to her I wish you well Always Lucca Hurrah for Puccini There he is now God help us,Puccini came home at last Good to see you again He means Giocondo Hope it means they won't start any fighting Like they used to Hey,hey I wish you were happy to see me Ah? Do you expect me to bring a band down to the station? Listen,I'd better have a word with you No thanks,leave me in peace Wait,Giocondo,what about Elvira? What's happened to her? You're the only one able to tell me -Giuseppe put the empty ones up there -Yeah Why haven't I heard anything? Her last letter was five months ago He,you mean you really want to give me a chance to get a little satisfaction I've got some sad news for you You know how it was I loved her but she loved you Every time we fought over, you always beat me up No,come on Three years ago when you went away I told myself Giocondo, Elvira is certainly never going to marry you for love Maybe I might be able to influence her father -He'd want a rich son-in-law -And so I began to work like a dog And then It paid off all right So I bought myself some fancy clothes The usual bunch of flowers -And I went over to -Her father?-Yeah And he accepted you? Of her marrying you? No,the old fellow threw me out of the house He's found a Count for her, an old Count with 75,000 acres of land The ceremony will be held tomorrow I hope she's forgotten you If not,I guess it'd be better if she married you For me it's the same but at least she'd be content Thanks -Elvira, -I've been waiting For you to come back To pass this way You expected me? For a long time You're still as beautiful And you,you haven't changed at all Have you? Just a bit That's why I came back Now I find everyone else has changed much more than I Come here Why did you stop writing to me? I felt that you had gone into a new life A strange life The most famous people and artists -I was sure you'd forget me -Never Elvira,believe me all that time There wasn't a moment I didn't love you What shall we do,Giacomo We'll be far away from your father no one will be able to separate us But tomorrow I gave my promise He forced you,it's not valid Elvira because you made me a promise before I remember it with all of my heart Elvira,I left two years of my life on that one promise But winning my battle for a career isn't enough -I want you -But how? What shall I tell my father? How will he think about it? It'd be much better if you thought of your own feelings You pick the man you must marry,Elvira I can't live without you Giacomo I'm desperate -Help me -Oh my dear,my dear come away with me now Yes,yes We'll be happy won't we? Of course I'll care for you all of my life My father did wrong,wrong We'll be true to each other And good,we will be happy Yes,darling As counsel for the present cooperation The mandate of Giulio Ricordi president by proxy is transferred to us We unanimously agree first We are contract with Giacomo Puccini musician and all the terms of the contract considering the poor quality of the last production of the author in question and considering exorbitant the amounts of monies paid monthly up to the present This counsel now reject the opportunity of renewing his contracts and payments -Elvira -Giocondo,stop for a moment please Now what Signora you know I don't get paid for waiting Just a moment,please I didn't know you were in Milano I've all moved in,you see Since when? Ten days ago you may not believe it But when you left Lucca especially since I was never able to see you on Sundays Do you think badly of me? Oh,what a thing to say I said, if she'd have eloped with me,I'd have justified it so And the others? The others are unimportant Have you,have you seen my father? Sure every Saturday at the market of piazza San Michele He keeps repeating he'll forgive you Yes,on one condition,that I leave Giacomo When he finds out you're happy he'll bless you Everybody back home feels he should give his consent So you and Giacomo just be patient Of course,that's the only thing Please let's go it's time Just a moment I'm coming You see,we are moving Elvira,if you're having difficulties -You still need Giocondo -I know,thank you But I have everything I need Really,there's nothing Listen lady,I'm getting pneumonia Will you come and visit us Via Salcerina 73? Yes Giacomo -Hello -Hello Haven't you anything to say? It's a castle I thought I could make a curtain out of the summer spares(?) And I was thinking Where's the piano? -The piano? -Yes,the piano where is it? You know I need it, why didn't they bring it? I tried to stop them,I begged them -I promised -You didn't renew the rental? No You haven't played for so long And so you'd rather I don't play the piano,eh? Is that your purpose? Make me a banker or something or put me in business I'm sure to become somebody then Giacomo,I don't want you to give up I want everything for you,the world That's what you say but you don't mean it Otherwise you would have felt what I expected from you Just a bit of encouragement a spark for my work Elvira,I beg you to help me I understand that you want to But to dispose of the piano Better to have spent our last lira Giacomo I bought this Forgive me Who do you want? Signor Ricordi,and this time you can't put me off Just a minute,you can't go in there he's in conference now -Signor Ricordi -He forced his way right past me It's all right,Valeri Finally be able to talk with you All these months past speaking only to ushers,secretaries,vice presidents But now you have to hear me I finally found the story for me I want to write an opera from this here it is But this one's been written by Massenet What difference does it make Massenet written one I'll write another Manon Well,Giacosa and Illica seemed quite surprised at your strange idea But why? Do they feel they're unable to produce a libretto out of it? For the moment we don't see the use of it We could never do it better So then Raphael should have stopped painting Madonnas because there already were so many others What can we do dear Puccini In as much as your previous works hardly been outstanding -And the Council of Administration -Yes I know Your Council of Administrators doesn't even think that my ability is worth the 200 lira months that they paid me But then it was you who picked the libretto I felt it was wrong all through the work to be pretending to make music like a parrot But let's not be pretending but I'm going to revoke a decision of the Counsel Merely because you have my sympathy Signor Ricordi There's someone suffering,a girl about to have a baby There's a limit to what she can take I've even lost my piano Too bad,I'm sorry let me study your case Come back again in about two weeks Don't bother I've been told that before,come back Oh what do you want here Elvira said you were in Milano now for over a month I'm looking for Elvira but I'd rather talk to you Go on I've already seen the furniture Now I see this house you're doing alright Listen why do you bother me I can manage without your help That's all very fine -But how are you eating? -There's plenty for me and for her And if you don't start minding your own business I'll break your head Try it Signor Puccini,Signor Puccini where were you all afternoon? I tried to find you they had to take her to the hospital the poor little thing -When? -About 4 -Where? -Via Ascenda -How is she? -Why don't you keep still -How is she? -The first one is never easy,you know I think it's better you went to see her Look here,I'll need money to get there Here -Would you save these please? -Sure -I brought them for the Signora -Thank you -Thank you -Please I'm so proud,darling,he looks like you Just like you Are you pleased that it's a boy? Oh yes how do you feel about it,Elvira I'm proud too Giacomo Do you think that now we'll begin to understand each other better? I don't want to hurt you any more and I know that I have sometimes Oh,no,Elvira we're going to start again from now on I need you with me but I feel it's all going to be different -We must be kinder to each other -Of course You are my life to me and my music more than my music -More? -And better Please don't be tiring her too much -No -Tomorrow I'll bring you flowers And I'll be here every day -Come on now lift it -All right,hold now Who's this for? I don't know in there -Come on -Oh,yes Your landlady gave me permission to enter while you were out They are bringing a piano in here? It's for you,my dear Puccini And I bring more Illica and Giacosa are now at work on the libretto Here is something that I hope to receive together with music of high quality And here is that opera Manon by Massenet but only to remind you to go higher If you want to win your battle and yours must fill us more than this one does Now here's a check for 800 Lira But please my associates know nothing of this,eh? It's a secret for me and you What's wrong? Hard to believe it? Thank you Thank you Oh Signora,welcome home Oh the baby,show me the baby He is asleep you can see him later it's too cold here Oh yes,and I have a present for you and I bring it when I come to see you -You know if my husband is home -I don't know Giacomo Giacomo What is it? Signora Puccini All those men would drive you mad All those men are just the same And we make children stupid women are Wait I'll be back Signor Puccini Signor Puccini Now what do you think you're doing Never mind about that your wife been waiting outside for over an hour Take your hands away from him Elvira We waited for you for ten days Waited,waited, waited your son And the mother of your son Ten days Forgive me ,Elvira, but I've worked all these 10 days And once the music comes into my head I've got to finish it now that I had a chance my thoughts have been only on Manon Manon? I hate Manon There will be other Manons and I'll hate them all -Good morning -Well good work It appears for the first time after many years I'm putting on an opera I've complete confidence in -Sit down -Thank you And in order to thank you I found a bonus for you I prepared a big surprise My feelings are beyond words you'll understand Cristina,a wonderful Manon Good Morning,Maestro It's a long time since we've met -Cristina -You mean you know each other? Now who could imagine it after all Cristina's appeared abroad for quite some time Now I can't even plan a surprise for our maestro But your surprise worked,dear Ricordi Didn't it maestro? Puccini must remember me when I was different I was only a little girl then Isn't it true? I feel I owe you a debt of gratitude,Maestro But most important was what I learned about friendship through you -Well,speak about Manon -What do you think about it It's a marvellous opera Manon will be somewhere wherever music is heard They like my opera Tonight I really feel that the public is with me It's marvellous isn't it? You're very handsome in that suit -It fits -Yes I have to go backstage excuse me Well don't go away please don't leave me alone It's easier if you stay here with me,please But I'll meet you in the intermission I'll be coming back here -Bye -Giacomo -Well Ricordi -Listen to them We continue like this will be a triumph Massenet written one,I'll write another You remember Perhaps the public thinks you're right The director of the Opera in Buenos Aires is already been to see me He wants to option Manon for presentation all through South America We'll speak again during intermission -Oh,you were adorable -I've asked him tonight to Cernis(?) Even his editors will turn up Is he so irresistible that he's escaped marriage? Oh,no I've heard he's not quite married There's supposed to be some little girl from the country trying to get him A young man does need to... Please where can I find Maestro Puccini? There in the dressing room with Signora Bernini Excuse me Come on,we'd better be moving Puccini,Puccini We're all waiting to applaud you I received your invitation please let me thank you And I'm honoured And here is Vice Consul Omaro, Countess Duc de Pravi -How do you do -And Duke of Olmo-How do you do And I hope you and all people expecting you breathlessly at home -You and all of course -Yes naturally Excuse me Elvira I looked around everywhere for you but I thought that you'd gone home We've had a great success Yes Well,I'm invited to a celebration with Ricordi at the Countess I can't possibly refuse And I know it would be very dull for you So go back to the hotel and wait for me and order us a bottle or two and I won't be very long Shall I take you back? You mustn't keep them waiting Giacomo -It's only a few steps to the hotel -I'll see you later then How does it feel,you waking up to such a sensational success? So good I'm buying a house near a lake -Signor Fanelli -Oh You may go home now I know it's you and not Giacomo Excuse me,Signora Elvira,Giacomo Giacomo has gone hunting and he told me He didn't want you to be worried You don't have to be concerned about me -Yes,but he told me.. -You'd better go home,Signor Fanelli Yes, yes it's better But look I want you to know Giacomo has gone out hunting Giacomo What are you doing here? She has discovered that it was only me at the piano -I don't play well enough -What did you say? -That you were out hunting -And so? She knows exactly what kind of game you're out hunting Why? What did she say? Nothing in particular but there was a funny look in her eyes when she told me to go home Giacomo I know women and I want you to listen to me That woman knows everything about you two Cristina,Cristina Cristina Christina where are you going? Where I'm no trouble Wait a minute can't you understand? Elvira knows all about us Oh she does eh? What's that supposed to mean to me? What is the difference between us once and for all? Why must I always be the one who has to put up with this humiliation Having to sneak around in the dark like a common criminal It's unjust to speak that way Cristina Unjust? Anything is unjust to you when it touches her Bear in mind that when it comes to Elvira we're both at fault I see And so that's the difference is it? I'm the one to blame for it and she's the victim You feel that you can judge us I'm sorry,Giacomo but when you speak to me like that I feel and still what I was to you so many years ago A second choice And I don't feel I can go on that way any longer Cristina -Giacomo -What is it? The wind is rising hurry up Alright alright the lady will be right there Addio -I'll meet you again in Torino -Yes We'll begin work on Boheme Elvira,I'm sorry I know you can't forgive me now Sorry You're always sorry Do you want me to give you up? No,Elvira No I won't,never I beg you listen Maybe I should It would mean less suffering After a while But I will never leave you Not for my sake but for yours You don't know what you're doing You're destroying everything Your career,us But you don't know it now But someday you will You will I want only happiness for you Then how can you see me in so much pain Please forgive me Forgive,always forgive Elvira I love you You can't leave me Ever Close your eyes There Now open them Well now,don't you like it? What's wrong? Nothing perhaps I was thinking of the day You were going to take me to visit to Lake Como This has cost you a bit more Then I hope it pleases you a bit more Too bad it does What do you mean? Nothing never mind Sometimes I wonder how it all turned out this way Very lovely But why am I so honoured? I don't know Maybe,maybe it's because you're much more unselfish than I am I'm glad you realized it I know quite well you're no longer happy with me Oh no I'm just different It's you that won't allow me to be happy Or maybe,maybe I'm unable to accept this situation What are you trying to say? You have to make up your mind I have no use for a man divided in two even if his name is Giacomo Puccini Anna Anna Hurry up Bring me the costume I may be wrong,Giacomo But I feel we must arrive at a decision once and for all All right if you really have to But why tonight the premiere of Boheme? Of our opera Because it's tonight of all nights that you'll be able to make your choice It's really very simple I who am singing the music you created Or the other one Who's not even here to offer you a bit of comfort In case you're not a success tonight You ought to know better than anyone why she isn't here Listen to me Whatever you may say to justify her It won't change matters You have to make your choice It's me or that little provincial whom you can't even take anywhere without being embarrassed We have too much in common No woman can replace the Opera She may be a provincial But I can't help thinking That little girl never said anything like that about you She's not as honest Perhaps Elvira is generous She's perfect I suppose Well remember that when you decide Because tonight you have to choose It's me or her What's the matter? Is it your conscience? You're afraid she'll suffer? But wouldn't she suffer even more If you choose to stay with her because you know as well as I do You'd spend the rest of your life searching desperately for some Cristina or other Who could understand you and help you Ten minutes,please Coming Be strong Hello,hello,excuse me Will I be indiscreet if I asked where you were going? To Elvira -Oh well all right -Just a moment How do you mean that all right Nothing I know that she was up in a box alone So I was thinking Well,Elvira's concerns you think too much my friend And you not enough What do you mean by that? Well answer me I'm not answering I'm asking Why don't you marry her I'll tell you why Because this way is more convenient You never know maybe one day You might want to get rid of her And leaving a wife is more complicated You know I'd prefer to let you go on doing whatever you want But this is wrong It's sordid Disgusting So I finally got it all out And I've waited so long to say it And now I'm going back to the theatre cause you're a mangy dog I'm fed up with you But your music is magnificent -Good luck -Thanks Giacomo -When did you arrive? -Just now Look like our old attic -The baby has a little cold -Has he fever? No he says it will go away when you come home -Did he really say that? -Yes When I come home He sent you this for your birthday Excuse me Elvira I have to go See you then at the hotel? Yes Giacomo,vieni You go out,go ahead Giacomo Cristina come My dear Countess But you're not to fly away You've not forgotten that tonight you will be at supper with us -No,no , naturally -Oh you frightened me Excuse me I'll be right back Oh I never let them out of my sight Elvira Elvira,come There are some of my friends I want you to meet Come Maestro,maestro I found you Countess,at last I have the pleasure of presenting my wife Oh,how nice She's most delighted to accept your invitation And so am I -Aren't we? -Oh,yes Shall I put out your evening dress,Madame? Tonight I won't need it Now we are near our simple street(?) I won't leave you any more Not for a minute I mean it I believe you Giacomo I believe you Mama,when papa comes home again couldn't he stay with us a long time? A long time ago I told you I would never leave you Do you remember? I loved you and I thought I had the strength to stay with you In spite of all the heartaches But now so many things have changed Only you never change I'm tired Giacomo And without hope for us any more How much you meant to me And how little I ever meant to you I know that I'm in your way And even to write the word hurts more you could ever believe You want to be free Perhaps you were born to be free And now at last I wish to give you your freedom Especially freedom from sending me picture postcards and rag dolls without life or love So when you come back I'll be gone Tonio is now grown up You will be proud of him Goodbye Giacomo If it's bitterness that gives me the courage to do this I am grateful to it Perhaps I no longer love you And even if it is an illusion I am grateful to that too Goodbye -Tonio -Father- How are you? You've grown up to be a man let me look at you And tell me how do you find school here? Fine father, fine In New York my agents took up a lot of time in the negotiations for the rights to Butterfly You know they're not quite as fast as here in Milan about these things But now before we talk of anything else I brought you that watch I promised you Here with all my best Thank you Father Tonio Where is your mother? I don't know father Tonio It's very important that I speak with her We must have her with us She must come back It's better if mama doesn't come back But why? Because She was too unhappy at home But the other day When she came to see me It seemed that at last she found peace Father It's better if you don't look for her I'll write you about her My mind's made up I'm going to the country I don't intend composing another note I couldn't even if I wanted to -But Butterfly? -And Butterfly Butterfly Here is the libretto as we have found it And we rewrote the end just the way you wanted it She blindfolds the baby before her suicide We rewrote it to fit your music Now it goes perfectly with what you had in mind Before you left for America They worked so,and the fragments I've heard About the very best,supreme Well there's my car I'll have to be going now I'm afraid I'm quite sure there's no other way It's better if I'm all alone Maybe if I feel different somewhere Pardon me Giulio you've been a friend to me We'll see we'll see what I find in the country Good luck to you Giacomo Please be careful driving that car Now who's that? Good morning maestro This is Delia the doctor sent her to look after you Her for the way you smashed yourself up in that car You'll need someone to take care of you Maestro to begin the morning right the doctor said I should take your temperature To begin the morning right We just need some good strong coffee that's all It's ready for you Well did you think it over Will you write to Elvira? No I told you I won't have Elvira come here out of pity Just because I had an accident Most women come back anyway even if you don't want them Enough I once heard of a woman because a man wouldn't take her back She was so hurt,ping ping, she murdered him I'll tell you Elvira won't return Thermometer maestro Delia,you can't take his temperature while he's eating Later What are you doing? What are you hiding there? Let's see come on Madame Butterfly where did you find it? I found it one day while I was putting the room in order I never meant to do it any harm I didn't say you harmed it Did you read it? -Mm-hmm -All through? Yes many times The story is so beautiful Oh is it? And what's it about? Sit down Well go on It's the story of a young woman And the wonderful man she fell in love with And she would say please love me But love me in a small way small as a baby's love As simple as my heart Dear Giulio,I've been meaning to write and tell you that I've taken up the music for Butterfly again My life is full of enthusiasm and work,work,work Who's there? -Delia is it you? -Yes I'm right here,Maestro Oh good come in and take this Tomorrow morning please post this letter And don't forget it huh? Oh Delia it's almost eleven Why didn't you go earlier? Your father will be worried My father had to go to America he couldn't find work around here any more As a boatman on the lake And so you live alone? Alone and far away seven miles each morning and night I don't mind but when it rains the roof leaks My dear foolish girl you can't go out in this weather You might have told me before You know there's plenty of room upstairs You don't mind my staying here? Of course not Oh many thanks -Signor Puccini -Who's there? I'm Delia's father But aren't you in America? In America? Of course not We're down there less than two miles found a piece of land It's better than nothing Oh oh I see Well go in go in So you quit the sea and became a farmer A man has to live So you keep busy Like most men do this year will go better Well that's good So you'll be able to finish repairing the roof on your house And you won't be getting wetter Getting wet? I guess you're joking Signor Puccini Sir,I worry about Delia I don't want to cause any fuss yet -Yet it's strange -Sit down It's two weeks since she left us to stay here And it does look bad It would be different if Signora Elvira was in the house I quite understand Well,we'll send Delia home tonight I'm very sorry Signor Puccini my girl can return to work Whenever the Signora finds use for her All my respect,Sir Papa What is it you said? What did you say to him? Delia If he sends me away because of you I swear you'll be sorry Delia So your father's in America eh? And the roof leaks Oh tonight you go back home Come now Stop crying Don't you think I may have understood Why you told me all those little lies It may seem cruel but it's the only sensible thing Look at me Do you know how old I am? I have a son almost as old as you I know we suffer a lot about these things There are so many fine young boys around will be wanting to marry you You'll see it passes You have to leave You do understand? Delia,go Let me stay here,please,I'm only happy when I near you Delia Delia In the morning when I'm back I don't want to find you here,understand? Good evening What are you all looking at you've seen me before haven't you? It's nothing nothing You just got it the face A face of a man who wants to play cards Now move over let me have some wine You see everybody knew you couldn't stay away for long,Giacomo Who deals the cards? Gino There's been an accident Come here Help,help Keep them searching keep them looking anywhere Fanelli Yes those men will go on looking all night for her Now Giacomo,don't blame yourself so After all it was a very sad accident but we mustn't What accident? What accident? How can you say it was an accident And we weren't even able to bury her That's enough out of you don't laugh This is not a comedy here The people will not accept Madame Butterfly And the fault is mine Mine alone you see Because everything a man is becomes his music Giacomo the public must one day come to the realization that they've made an error I am more than honoured to have been the one to bring Madame Butterfly to the stage Be sure and print that for your readers Gino Of course,Sir -Maestro Puccini -Impossible to see Maestro Puccini just now But I have to speak to Maestro Puccini A few minutes,Giocondo, he knows me and I felt it was better If someone stays with him a moment -Giacomo -Let's get out of here Giacomo Giacomo,come on,it won't be long If it had lasted any longer I would be a sleep Oh,boy, sentimental They'll never give it again Embarrassing to have to watch I don't know anything so.. A little bit of Manon a drop of la Boheme And he thinks he has a new opera Perhaps he'll turn up with something better next time -(Next time?Puccini is finished) -And they're right,Giocondo I know that I am finished Let's go now,let's go home I'll fix the light,eh Please Now listen Elvira,Elvira you've come back Yes I thought I could stay away But I couldn't I was at the Opera I had to see you Like something happened to me Your music was so beautiful I knew it was beautiful because of something In you Something And nothing to do with me or us Only you and I forgot everything mean or unhappy between us I just listened and I was proud So proud of you And it was you who applauded? Yes,it was me I love you Giacomo I never stopped loving you I don't know why but I feel it so deeply without each other without each other we are lost We have had the pleasure to present selected audience from the pages of Madame Butterfly by Giacomo Puccini to commemorate the 20th anniversary of its first performance My friends if I were alone I'd speak to the walls to the photographs to the years that went so quickly I beg you don't misunderstand me I would like to say Thank you to whom I don't know to all of you and to music which has always been very good to me to the orchestra to the public and to all the many pianos I've had And the first simple tune I played to my fine Tonio I feel so proud he's here for this occasion I'd also thank the men who understood Ricordi The premiere tomorrow but he'd say Giacomo,the new music in the second act It's better than the finale and to all the old friends who aren't with us I say thanks and to the new ones You young people who'll help me write Turandot I wanted it to be the best one and I feel it can be the best one For you Elvira I thank God each day for all you've done for me and for your love because you see I know now You said I'd find it out I'd be a failure without you I'd have done nothing I'd have meant nothing No,no don't think I'm sad today I'm happy there's every reason to rejoice So let's drink a toast We've been listening for 20 years to Butterfly And now we're still listening to it My friends I drink in the hope of our being around this table 20 years from now listening to Turandot Elvira where are you going? I'll be right back I forgot to tell Anna something -Good Luck -Good Luck Mama what is it? What's happened here since I've been away? Tonio your Yes,mama -Your father -What? -He's sick -Badly? Here it is Tonio He doesn't know he mustn't know -The doctor said -What? There's no hope none Now boys I didn't want you to know But you have to help me It's best to finish as speedily as possible Because there isn't much more time And what's in here Won't wait for any of us Good night Mama Your father is still working Perhaps he'll get sleepy Listen mama you're not able to continue this -You have to get rest -No,no You can't be sitting up every night come along -Come -I'm alright Now I'll take care of him But you sleep well don't worry he'll be fine You're a sweet boy Antonio a good son And a brave one Your father is so proud of you Try to sleep a little while There father Better start obeying the doctor We'll go to that clinic in Brussels and arrange things for the operation You know Antonio Yes -And your mama knows -No the doctor told only me but if you refuse to stop this I'll tell her I have to finish Turandot But you're almost finished father When you feel better you'll be able to Listen I'll go with you but you have to promise me that you won't say anything to your mama No I don't want her to suffer any more for me Here the opera ends because of the death of the Maestro Subtitles by Nostromo
