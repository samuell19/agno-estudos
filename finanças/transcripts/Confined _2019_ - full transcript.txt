(SLOW ELECTRONIC MUSIC) Three months. I know, I'm so excited. I'm not sure if I'm more excited about the wedding or the honeymoon, though. Oh, the honeymoon. Besides, the wedding's just a glorified cookout. I'd rather just say, "I do," and get a plane to Fiji. Oh, there will be a wedding. You know how important that is to my family. And besides, I deserve a day where I'm the center of attention and look like a queen in my dress. You bet your ass we're doing that part. Oh, because you're really struggling for attention, right? Donnie, look out! (TIRES SQUEALING) (CAR THUDDING) (GLASS SMASHING) (EERIE ELECTRONIC MUSIC) (HEART BEATING) (SUSPENSEFUL ELECTRONIC MUSIC) (HEART BEATING) (EERIE VOCAL MUSIC) (DRAMATIC ELECTRONIC MUSIC) I tried to tell them that if we go for that argument the judge will not listen. Ortez is logic-based. The client is going at it in such an emotional way. I tried to tell them that if we use that argument the judge won't go for it. It amazes me how people have an emotional reaction, then expect everybody else to understand how that is. And I mean, when you're the one in the situation, clearly you understand it better. The client just isn't hearing me. I hear you, babe. They come to you for advice and don't follow it. The meaning of ignorance is having access to information and simply not using it. Yes, sir. Can I get another beer, please? WAITER: Of course. Anything for you, ma'am? WOMAN: You know, I'll take another as well. All right, I'll be right back with those. Thank you. And I'm sorry I have been babbling on and on. How has your day been? Evidently not as eventful as yours. What's going on? Oh, nothing. Just some of the guys from the fantasy leagues. Anything else I can get you? I think we're good. Just the check. What the hell is this? I must be correct then. Why would I remember you? We've never met. What is he talking about? The accident. What accident? Makes sense that it wouldn't be as memorable for you as it was for me. Are you talking about the car accident we were in a couple of years ago? Exactly, Sara. SARA: Excuse me. It took me a while to track you down, but here we are. So what? We were in a car accident a couple of years ago. That doesn't give you the right to come over here and harass us. Because I was one of the people you hit. If you recall, there were several cars involved but only one person was seriously hurt, my wife. She died later of her injuries. Listen, what's your name? Noah Harvey. Listen, Noah, I'm sorry about your wife, I am. But what does that have to do with us now? Because of you, my world changed forever that day. Are you trying to say that your wife's death is my fault? It was your car that struck mine, Donnie. It's that simple. It was your responsibility. Because of you, my wife is no longer here with me. Noah, you have my sympathies, but it was not my fault. There were plenty of other people involved in that car accident. You can't just put that on me. I don't even remember seeing you. I remember you. That's what's important. It's been two years. Why are you just confronting us now? It took me a while to put all the pieces together. Pieces? It's not important right now. I just wanted you to know what you took from me, and that I'm here to get even. Listen to me, asshole, don't think you can come in here and shove your sorrow in our face just to try and get even. What happened to your wife was a tragedy, that's it. If you think you can come in here and threaten us and try to get away with it, you're wrong. You'll be amazed at what I can get away with. That is enough. Sir, I am very sorry, and I cannot even imagine the pain that you have gone through. But it wasn't our fault. It was just an accident. We didn't do anything wrong. You've done plenty wrong. I'll be the mirror for your indiscretion. And I will teach you the lesson you couldn't learn the first time. One step at a time. I'm sorry, is Noah bothering you? Damn right he is. This guy's got some serious mental issues, lady. We will take care of it. Lunch is on us today. (DRAMATIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Noah, you can't confront people in this manner. Your personal issues stay home. Fuck off. If all we have to do is deal with a crazy man to get a free meal, hell, I'd do that every time. There was definitely something off about him, something not right. You think? You just can't get something past people like that. I see it at work all the time. Lawyer. Can we just go one moment without you talking about yourself or your damn job? I'm sorry I'm passionate about my career and want to share that with my husband, how selfish of me. I don't mean it like that. Just don't be so sensitive. Sensitive, as you stand here and insult me? Now look, I didn't insult you. You basically insinuated that I'm self-absorbed. How is that not an insult? Sometimes maybe I'd like to talk about something different. What would you like to talk about, Donnie? Let's talk about politics, or how about the fact that we never see your family, or how about the baby you don't want to have? Plenty to talk about. Just once, we were having a nice day. And you just got to throw that in my face. This has been anything but nice. Now look, Sara. I think that guy was following us. You don't think it was the waiter from the restaurant, do you? That guy was certainly off his rocker. I think he was more hurtin' for attention than anything. (HORN HONKING) (TRAFFIC PASSING) (DRAMATIC ELECTRONIC MUSIC) (OMINOUS ELECTRONIC MUSIC) Sara, Sara. Sara, are you here? Hello, Donnie. You probably never thought you were gonna see me again, did you? Shame. I did try and warn you. Oh, you're probably wondering about your wife. Here she is, safe and sound. And she'll stay that way, with me, confined. That's actually what leads me to making this little video. I'm here to outline the rules for you. You have a week, one week, to find her. Don't go to the police, or she dies. And if you fail to find her, well, you're never gonna know what happens to her. Those are the rules, Donnie. One week. You find her, I'll return her to you and I disappear. If you fail to find her, she dies and you never find her body. One week, Donnie. The clock starts now. (DIRE ELECTRONIC MUSIC) What is this? Welcome to the next phase of my plan. Meet Sara Jeter, Donnie's wife. What's the deal here, man, you going to feed us or what? Noah, I can't do this. Kidnapping and keeping people hostage just to get back at one man for the accident. It's insane. This is what has to happen in order for him to understand what he took from me. From us, Noah. She wasn't just your wife, she was also my sister. No one loved her like I did. It is my responsibility to bring meaning to her death. I will do that by teaching these people the lesson they couldn't learn the first time. And I will do that any way I see fit. Come on, Mike, don't be a hater. He's building a fuckin' basketball team down here. Austin, would you shut up? You're going to do more harm than good. Mike, you can't leave yet. Game hasn't even started. Ain't that right, Noah? Shut your mouth or I will cut out your tongue. This has gone too far. I'm out. Might want to reconsider that, Mike. Really? And why is that? You gonna do something to me too? This is simple. You will do what I need you to do to accomplish my goal. Because if you don't, when I'm done with Donnie, you're next. You wouldn't. We're family. We're nothing. I have one purpose here. Anything and anyone that gets in the way of that will be removed. That includes you. Mike, hey Mike, you obviously don't want no parts of this, so how about you cut us loose, let us go, and we can all escape together? You saw what he did to you for running your mouth. If you keep it up, it'll just get worse. You don't know what he's capable of. We're all trapped in his game. Please, I don't want to die in here. Just help us get out. I can't, and don't ask me to. Why? Why can't you help us? 'Cause you're more worried about saving your own dick than helping us people. He's out of his mind. You don't understand. I understand. I understand plenty, you're just a coward. You don't know what you're talking about. You're just a stupid college kid with no clue about how life really works. I'm just trying to survive. But there's three of us to one of him. And when she wakes up, that's four. You don't get it. He has a plan for everything. Now you haven't witnessed what I have when it comes to Noah. It doesn't matter how many of us there are. He always wins. Donnie? Teddy, I need your help. Come in. What's it been, two, three years now? Three. Ever since you found out Sara and I were engaged. Right. Married now, I suppose. Yeah. And in fact, that's why I'm here... Never could listen to anyone else, could ya? Still with that shit? I listen. I just don't always agree. In fact, maybe I don't want to live your life. Never wanted you to live my life. That's why I tried to steer you away from her. You see, there are some people who once they get their grips into ya, it's awfully difficult for them to let go. Just always had that gut feeling about Sara. Teddy, just 'cause you're my older brother doesn't mean you're always right. You're wrong. And she's gone. What do you mean gone? She's been kidnapped, Teddy. What? How, by who? By some guy that blames me for killing his wife in a car accident a couple of years back. So you know who this guy is? Noah Harvey. Other than that and the fact that he was involved in this accident, that's all I got to go on. And if I go to the police, he says he'll kill her. You're an insurance investigator, yeah? Wouldn't you have ways to find out details about the accident or maybe more about this Noah Harvey? It'll take some digging, but yeah. Hold on a second and slow down for me here. How do you know she's gone? How do you know who this guy is? And how do you know why he's doing this? He put everything on a video on this flash drive. He left you a video and just revealed all this information to you up front? Well he confronted us at a diner. And then leaves this video with rules and these crazy consequences. I have a week to find her. I can't go to authorities. Teddy, I had nowhere else to turn. The fact that he revealed himself to you and his motivations up front, that's scary as shit. Oh, that's comforting. I'm sorry, Donnie. Just giving you the facts. Look, I'm glad you came to me. I know we haven't had the best relationship in the past, and I'm sorry about the things I've said. We'll figure this out. Just keep doing as he says and look for Sara any way that you can. In the meantime, I'll start digging. I'll get back to you as soon as I have something. Thank you Teddy, but please, be quick. TEDDY: I will. (DRAMATIC ELECTRONIC MUSIC) What's happening? Where am I? We're in some kind of storage unit. It's just the three of us. Who are you, why are we here? What's happening? 'Cause a madman is collecting people. Couldn't be normal and collect sports stuff, coins, shit, even guns. But nope, he collects people. What, who are you? My name is Brook. This smartass here is Austin. Sara, I don't know why we're here. How do you know my name? AUSTIN: That Noah guy that is down here said your name when he brought you here. Noah. Noah, I know who that is. How about enlightening the rest of us? He confronted me and my husband, Donnie, last night at dinner. He blames my husband for his wife's death in an accident a couple of years ago. - Okay. - Oh my God. - What? - What? My husband and I were in a car accident a couple of years ago, and it was bad. Several cars. A woman got killed. Oh, I know what you guys are talking about now. Me and my sister were in an accident. She totaled her car. Well, that's got to be it. He must be trying to get back at us for his wife's death. AUSTIN: We didn't do anything to him. Clearly he doesn't see it that way. Okay, we're going to have to work together to get out of here, so how often does he come in here? Just occasionally. Sometimes it's the other guy, Mike. There's another guy? Yeah, he has a real wimpy personality too. Okay, we're going to have to figure out how to get out, o I don't know, can either of you move? I think I can. Wait, Austin, see if you can get to that post. Try and cut yourself free. All right. Is it working? I think so. Oh shit. Hurry up. (DOOR RATTLING) (SARA SCREAMING) You just can't pay attention to the rules, can ya, Austin? What were you planning to do, hm? Oh, now you have nothing to say. Look, man, we can work this out. SARA: Leave him alone, you piece of shit. He's just a kid. Shut your mouth. You want a reason to leave this room? Hey, man, I'm just... I'll give you a reason. Come on. (DRAMATIC VOCAL MUSIC) Donnie, glad you could make it. Did I have a choice? You're right, I do kind of have you by the balls. You have to understand, none of this is what I wanted. It is what it has to be. You present yourself as not wanting to do any of this, but you're enjoying it. Torturing the man who took my wife from me, I can't say I don't find enjoyment in my work. You don't have to torture Sara, or me. I'll do anything you need. Just give her back to me. You don't own her, Donnie, so I won't be giving her back to you. That's exactly what this is about though, the lesson I'll teach. You have nothing to teach me. You have a lot to learn. You have no idea what love is or how to value it. And you know better? I never cheated on my wife. You're wondering how I knew. I've been studying you, Donnie, watching you. I know you better than you know yourself. There's no secret you carry around that I don't know about. I can't fathom how you know these things. But what happened to your wife was an accident. I can understand if it was on purpose, but it wasn't. Intentions are pointless. Actions are everything. I'm sure your intentions when you cheated on Sara were not to hurt her. But if she found out, would she care about your intentions or your actions? She doesn't know because it didn't mean anything. It was nothing. One year after you were married you have an affair for over six months and it didn't mean anything? That's ridiculous. It means everything now. Someone who recognizes the love he had in his life wouldn't take it for granted. You'll pay for that decision. I don't need to defend myself to you. You're a fucking psycho. You better learn quickly that you have everything to prove to me, Donnie. I own you right now. If you don't learn that lesson, you'll never find Sara. There are two types of people in this world, Donnie, those that learn from their mistakes and those that are destined to repeat them. Which kind are you? Noah might find out I'm helping you. Well, you're not the authorities so we didn't break his rules. So what'd you find out anyway? Well, what I have so far is brief. I've pulled all the records I could find from the accident and traced 'em from there. I think I can get more info on his background, but that's gonna take more time. From the records connected to the accident I have his address, contact info, job, that sort of stuff. We should be able to use that to find out where he might be operating from. Were you able to find out anything about any property he owns where he might be keeping Sara? Nothing yet, other than his home address. But I seriously doubt he's keeping her there. I plan to dig further to see if he's connected to any other properties. Maybe his family or his wife's family own something. But that's gonna take more time. Well I know this is all of a sudden, but her life hangs in the balance. I understand the urgency, Donnie. Let me recommend something to you. Yeah, I'll listen to anything at this point. The best thing we can do to find Sara is to learn everything we can about this guy. Who is he, what's his history? What can that information tell us about him? By studying him we should be able to learn about his routines, his habits, and that could lead us to Sara. Yeah, 'cause right now all we know is that he blames me. And why? I don't know the answer to that, but I do think we need to turn his game around on him. If we get information on him, we should be able to use it against him. So stay the course. Present yourself to him as if you're playing his game, that you're following his rules. All you want is to find your wife. In the meantime, I'll keep digging for information. Teddy, I'm not good at these mind games. Hell, I'm an engineer, I'm a numbers person, not a people person. Well you better figure it out quick because the only way to save Sara is to get inside this guy's head. Now I'm not saying you have to do it alone. That's what I'm here for. In the fraud cases I've investigated I've come across guys like this. Trust me. How do these situations typically play out? TEDDY: Well, that depends on the people involved. Oh shit. If you let me do my job and you keep your cool, we have a good chance of finding her. But if you don't go along with me on this, Noah will win. All right. Whoa, easy now. You need to listen to me, Donnie. Oh, you know my name. Do I get to know yours? My name's Mike. I'm Noah's brother-in-law. Son of a bitch. There's two of you? No, I'm nothing like him. I just came here to warn you, you have no idea what you're up against. Just give up and give him what he wants. What he wants? The only thing I know he wants is to make me suffer. And the only way to get around that is to find Sara. Do you know where he's keeping her? I can't tell you that. If I tell you, he will kill me. Maybe we can work together to take him down. It won't work. I'm just telling you this because no matter what he will win. No, no, no, no, no, he said I've got a week to find her. That means nothing. He wants to drive you to insanity, to make you suffer. Then why are you here? Are you helping him? He's forcing me to help. Look, to be honest, I wanted to make you pay too because you killed my sister, but he's gone too far. I can't get out. He has me trapped, just like you. Just run and save yourself. (MEN GRUNTING) (DONNIE GROANING) Damn it, Donnie. This isn't what I wanted. You know, you don't have to do this. This isn't an answer to your problems. - NOAH: Come on. - No, please, please don't kill me. I'm not gonna kill you, we're just talking. Now come on. Don't give in, Sara. Don't tell him anything. He's fucking crazy. Shut your mouth or suffer the consequences. AUSTIN: Psycho, huh? Sara, I want you to tell me why you decided to spend your life with Donnie. What? Why would you want to know that? Just answer the question. Because I love him. Why else would I be with him? I understand that. I want to know why you love him. You don't need to know something like that. You're not in a position to make that decision. I've studied Donnie's life, but I want your perspective. Why are you keeping me alive? We both know you're not going to let me go back to Donnie. NOAH: What makes you think that? Because you want us to suffer. You want me dead just like your wife is dead. You don't speak of my wife, understand? Then tell me about her, Noah. Make me understand. When a person comes into your life that gives every day meaning, that person becomes your conduit to the meaning of your own existence. So you saw your wife as someone to spend your life with, not just to be with? My wife was my teacher. She taught me everything about life. I just wanted to give that back to her, but she was taken from me before I could. It sounded like you loved her because of how she made you feel, not unconditionally. What you don't understand is the kind of person my wife was. There was no concern over how she would treat me. We all have bad days, but in today's society people only want to deal with each other when things are good. When things go wrong, they run. So now you're here to set us straight? What makes you think you know everything? I don't know everything, I've just seen what others haven't. Now I'm here to teach you what you should have learned from the beginning. I just want to go home. Even if Donnie finds me, you're not going to keep your word, are you? That wouldn't work into the lesson that you're trying to teach us. You're only alive because I've spared you. Remember that with every breath you take. Or should I say, every breath I've allowed you to take. I just want to go home. Just tell me, Noah, when are you gonna kill me? Fucking tell me. I'm not telling you what's going to happen because it hasn't been decided yet. I know much more about Donnie than you do. If you prove that you're open to learning who he really is, maybe you can save yourself instead of relying on him to do it. And if you ever lay your hands on me again, I will give you back to Donnie in pieces. (DRAMATIC ELECTRONIC MUSIC) (DIRE ELECTRONIC MUSIC) Hello, Donnie. What do you think of your beautiful wife now? What do I need to do for you to realize that I'm serious? Do I need to cut her? He's not gonna rescue you, Sara, because he's not a real man. He doesn't give, he takes from people. Donnie, do you really even love Sara? I don't think you know the answer. Clock's ticking. How's it gonna feel if you never know what happens to her? May I help you? Are you Donnie Jeter? Yeah, I am. Get back inside now. I don't know what you want, but you don't have to stick a gun in my face to get it. Just shut up. Just stop talking, okay? I was told I have to come here and kill you to get my brother back. Now what do you know about my brother? I don't know your brother. Yes, you do, you're lying. He said you would know. Who said? WOMAN: He said his name is Noah. He took your brother? Yes, that's why I'm here. Now how do you know it was Noah for sure? Just answer me. Why do I have to kill you to get my brother back? And you think by doing so he's just gonna hand over your brother? I don't know. DONNIE: Let's just go back a few steps here. Tell me your name. Haley. Listen, Haley, you don't look like a killer to me. I don't want to kill anyone. I don't know why this is happening. Why can't he just leave us alone? Haley, he has my wife too. You and I, we're in the same situation here. We can help each other. He sent me these video messages. If we work together, we can find 'em both. You would do that? Yeah, I would. But what would we do? Well, we would start by you handing over the gun. We can sit down and talk it through. I'll put the gun away, but I'm keeping it. Fair enough. (DARK ELECTRONIC MUSIC) Come on. So let's start from the beginning. How do you know that Noah has your brother? He left me a flash drive with a video on it. He was on there with my brother, Austin. What did he say? He said if I want my brother back I have to kill you. I can't go to the police or anyone else for help or he'll kill Austin. He said he's watching. He left me these to prove he's watching. Convincing. Could this be a joke? I'm afraid not. I didn't want to believe it. Haley, Noah kidnapped my wife and blames me for killing his wife in a car accident a couple of years ago. I just don't know where... I was in a car accident with my brother a couple of years ago. I'll be damned. He's after everyone involved. Then why would he tell me to kill you? I don't know. I do know that he blames me most. And killing me would just ruin his game. Maybe he thinks we'll turn on each other. Maybe, but he plans everything in advance. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Hold tight. May I help you? Donnie Jeter? Who's asking? My name is Sam Ryan. I was told to deliver this box to you by a man named Noah. My wife is gone and he says he knows where she's at. I'm just trying to find her. Hey, Sam, I'm Donnie. Come on in. Thank you. Sam, meet Haley. - Hi. - Hello. So you brought me this box here to open, huh? Yes, do you know anything about my wife? I don't. But I can tell you one thing, whatever's in this box is gonna give us some answers. See what we got here. A flash drive, that's it? Gonna tell us everything we want to know. Come on, have a seat. I think I'll stand. Suit yourself. Hello, team. So excited that everyone could be gathered for my little pep talk. Here are your loved ones. Don't they just look so excited? So this is really simple. Whichever one of the two of you kills Donnie will get their loved one back unharmed. Of course, if you should choose that Donnie's life means more, I guess they could always stay here with me. After all, they look pretty comfortable. But if you should decide to play the game the way it's supposed to be played, whichever one of you kills Donnie, delivers his body to the Motel Inn at Conley and Kidd, in room 23, will see their loved one again. The other one, well, tick tock, time's running out. Who the fuck is this guy? What's happening, how did he get Brook? Now, Sam, you're going to have to calm down. Don't tell me to calm down. Who the fuck are you? You don't know me. Now I get it, this is the first of these videos that you've seen. But it's not for Haley and I. Then why is he doing this? Because we were all involved in a car accident that killed his wife a couple of years ago. He wants revenge now. The car accident was two years ago and he's just doing this now? What kind of psycho is this guy? Listen, my brother's an insurance investigator. He's helping us out with this. Why don't you come with us? He can help you too. But he said on the video we have to kill you. You just called him a psycho a minute ago. Why would you listen to him? Trust us. SAM: What do you know? Listen, I've been dealing with this guy. You can't trust a thing he says. It's all part of his sick, twisted game. I can't just kill somebody. I'm not a murderer. And that's exactly what he's counting on. The fuck are you talking about, man? I'm not going along with his game. I'll take my chances with the police. There's more people involved than just you. If you do that, he's killing everyone. I don't give a shit who's involved. The fuckin' psycho has my wife. If I can't go to the police then I'll make him tell me where she is. If you do that, it'll risk all their lives, not just your wife's. SAM: That's a chance I have to take. Are you Noah? Sam, so nice to finally meet you. How's Brook? Is this really necessary, Sam? Tell me where she is. Come on, Sam. You're not gonna do anything to me. I'm the only one who knows where Brook is. You're not following my rules. Shouldn't you be killing Donnie? Why are you doing this? I've done nothing to you. Interesting how you say you've done nothing without a mention of your wife. (NOAH GROANING) I'll fucking kill you if you don't give her back to me. What's the matter, Sam? Feeling guilty about how you treated Brook? (NOAH GROANING) Shut up. You want another chance to make it right. (NOAH GROANING) You never deserved Brook, Sam. That's why I took her away from you. You don't know what you're talking about. Yes, I do. I've watched you both for a long time. I know about the beatings, the cheating. And after all of that, she stayed with you. (NOAH GROANING) Doesn't sound like love to me, Sam, it sounds like someone you can control. How do you know so much? I've watched you both for a long time. You don't deserve Brook, so I took her away. (NOAH GROANING) Tell me where she is. You think taking my wife is a game? This is my life you messing with. Stop, Sam, Sam, stop. Donnie Jeter to the rescue. If you kill him, we don't find them. He'll kill of them, you understand that? Easy, easy. You're breaking the rules, Sam. He ain't breaking your damn rules. You know better. So you're the one who's behind all of this? Look, I'm really sorry about your wife. But Austin didn't do anything, I was driving. Exactly, Haley. Each of you here today were the ones driving. So you suffer the most. At least that's what I thought. Then I started watching all of you. None of you appreciate what life has given you. All you do is take it for granted. Don't listen to him, Haley. Look, I'll do anything you want, just please let him go. You're already doing exactly what I want you to do. Just let me take him to the police, Donnie. Then they'll find them. You don't think I've thought of every contingency plan? Something happens to me, something happens to them. I'm taking you to the police. I'm done listening to this shit. Uh, uh, uh, not so fast. You remember her? Fine, I'll go to the police, show them the video you left us, then they'll hunt you down. Sam, stop. We can still find 'em. Donnie, you do what you have to do. I'm going to the police. Didn't you hear what he just said? If you go to the police you'll risk all of them. I'm not listening to anything he has to say. He's insane. You can't deal with people like this with talking, you got to use force. I'm going to the police. (GUN FIRING) Consequences. I can't make this any clearer. I always have someone watching and you never know where they are. You two should probably leave before the neighbors call the police. You know what'll happen if you get caught talking to them. Go! Oh my God, he just killed him. He's insane. Haley, you're going to have to calm down. Calm down? He just murdered Sam. How am I supposed to be calm? What are we going to? We'll have to regroup. Why aren't you driving yet? We're going to need a plan. If we make one wrong move he'll kill us, or he'll kill Austin or your wife. We're going to have to go somewhere quiet where we can think. We need to get you some place safe where Noah doesn't know where you're at. What about you? Well, I'll have to find a way to turn this game around on him. I don't believe he's gonna give them back to us alive. Let's go. I think it's best if you stay here for while. I'll be back in a little bit, and hopefully we'll figure something out. What if he does to you what he did to Sam? I don't think he'll do that to me. You see, I'm too important in his game. If he kills me, if he eliminates me, it's game over. Well maybe that's his plan, to pick us off one by one. It's like he wants to teach us and make us suffer at the same time. Just a narcissistic ass. And what he did to Sam, it's like his way of proving a point, letting us know that he's capable of anything. I don't think I can handle this. Haley, you have to, for your brother's sake. Maybe this was meant to be. I've been a terrible sister to him. Ever since our parents passed away I've been more focused on myself than on helping him. Maybe this is my selfishness catching up with me. Now, that's Noah getting in your head. And if you do that, we lose. You have to stay strong. Nobody's ever stood up for me the way you did today. You don't know what that means to me. I said we're gonna be fine. You hold tight, you're going to be all right. TEDDY: Donnie, get in. Teddy, what's going on? - Hurry up, get in. - All right. So what's got you so freaked out? I'm sorry to approach you like this, but I found some disturbing information when I looked into Noah Harvey. We're not dealing with any average guy here, Donnie. That's an understatement. No, he's done some crazy shit. I mean, borderline evil. He used to be in the FBI, retired early, supposedly to spend time with his wife. But from what I found, it seems like he was discharged. He ended up starting a security business with a friend from the bureau, but get this, not long after they started working together, everything went sideways, according to this guy. What'd he say? Well, we're going to go see him right now. He agreed to meet with us. Well, let's go. All right, but are you ready to hear what he has to say? I think we're going to have to be. You got it. DONNIE: So how do we know this guy? TEDDY: As I was digging into Noah's history, his business is on record, and his business partner, Kliff Harrell is on record as a co-owner. So, I tracked him down and gave him a call. He almost hung up on me until I said the name Noah Harvey, then he couldn't wait to spill the beans on him. - This should be interesting. - Yeah. You Teddy? Hey, Kliff. Is this your lucky brother? DONNIE: Yeah, Donnie Jeter. All right, come on in. You guys can have a seat right there. So, Donnie, you get the pleasure of dealing with Noah Harvey. How lucky are you? (DONNIE SIGHING) Oh, do you guys want a drink? No, no thanks. You're going to have to share a glass. Uh-uh, I'm good. Well, all right. More for me. I'm sorry he took your wife, man. The guy thinks he's some kind of messiah, always got to be right. He's not right, self-righteous. What can you tell us about him? Well, we were friends when we were both in the FBI. We weren't partners but we worked in the same unit. And eventually he took things too far with several suspects, gave him a bad reputation with the bureau. After one too many incidents they discharged him. They let him keep his pension, probably so they didn't bring any attention to the situation. Tell him about your security business, Kliff. Well, I put in my 20 years. I retired. He approached me after I retired. Yeah. Wanted to start a small security business, wanted to go after big businesses, talking to them about tightening up their security, IT, things of that nature. So we were on this one case with this law firm. They did criminal law so they wanted things very tight. We disagreed on how to approach this one. I stood my ground, he stood his. Why don't we just go to our customer and let them decide what approach they want? He was not having it, it infuriated him. We just couldn't come to a compromise in the situation. I worked late one night, thought he had already gone home. But nope, he was sitting in his car waiting for me to come out. I felt like he was stalking me. He gets out of his car and he starts threatening me. And he says that his way is the right way. And I said, you can shove it up your ass pal, and I left. I took a couple of days off, decided I was going to sell my share of the business. So what was his reaction to that? Well, I think you have a pretty good idea of what he's capable of. I filed harassment charges and sued him. He starts to terrorize me for just a few months. And I ended up winning the law suit. I dropped the harassment charges, just to get him to leave me the hell alone. Well did he? I haven't heard from him since. That was about two years ago, just around the time that his wife died. But it looks like you were his new project. Yeah, I'm afraid so. Any advice on how to get rid of this guy? Ha, listen, man, you have it was worse with him than I did. I would take everything to the police. I mean, I would send you to the bureau but this sounds more like a local police matter. Yeah, he said if we go to the police he'll kill Sara. I'm sorry to be so blunt, Donnie, but my guess is she's already gone. He's left traces of himself all over the place. He has to know if we go to the police, they could fry his ass. That'd scare me even more. He doesn't care if he gets caught. He thinks he's serving some type of purpose. He's a fruitcake man, I'm telling you. Well, Kliff, we thank you for the info. I'm sorry, I wish it had been better news, but don't play his reindeer games, man. Don't fuck around. Hey, good luck to you both, I hope you find her. Thanks again, Kliff. Oh fuck. NOAH: You two wait here. I'll be back in a second. (GUNS FIRING) You're gonna pay for what you've done. I always told you you have to pay for betraying me all those years ago, Kliff. I just didn't think it would be me that would bring it full circle. I'll haunt you from hell until you meet me there. Probably. (GUN FIRING) I told you I'm always watching. Stay out of my past. This is your one warning. I'll be in touch once I have more information on our next move. Okay. (DONNIE SIGHING) (PHONE BUZZING) Peyton, what the hell are you doing calling me? PEYTON: I hated the way we left things. And I started thinking, if you were telling me the truth, I want to help. Listen, let me say this out loud. So my wife has been kidnapped, and now my secret girlfriend wants to help me find her? Does that make any sense to you? PEYTON: I mean, not when you say it like that. Listen, this whole thing's my fault. I was the one that flirted with you, I was the one that pursued you. I had no business doing that. You're young, you're beautiful, you're smart. You can do much better than me. You got to move on. PEYTON: That's easier said than done. He knows about us, Peyton. The man that took Sara, he knows I had an affair and he's using it against me. I've seen him kill someone. You got to get as far away from me as possible. You're not safe until you do so. SARA: What are we doing now? NOAH: You'll find out soon enough. Well what if I want to know now? Why don't you just fucking kill me and put me out of my misery already? Sara, I thought we talked about this. SARA: Right, it wouldn't work out with your game. Mike, do you want to deal with her for me? Why do I have to? This is your project. I'm only here 'cause I have to be. Accept your fate, Mike, and do what I said. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) I'll be back in a few minutes. Mike, this is ridiculous. We can work together to get away from Noah. Don't start with this again, Sara. - It's not possible. - Not possible? How much of a coward are you? I'm not a coward. Okay, I just know what battles to pick and choose. You haven't seen what Noah is capable of. I've watched him torture people. He is going to kill me. Please, help me. We're in the same position here, Sara. I'm trapped too. (KNEE THUDDING) (MIKE GROANING) NOAH: What happened? She got out. You idiot. Don't just stand there, help me find her. You go that way, I'll go this way. Fuck, no! (SARA GRUNTING) (MIKE COUGHING) No, no, no! (SARA SCREAMING) Not this much trouble. (MUSIC DROWNS OUT SPEECH) Get up. You let a girl beat you up. MIKE: I thought you said from your surveillance that Sara was a spoiled brat. That's what I thought. MIKE: Yeah, well she's a lot tougher than she looks. Yeah, she is. She's earned my respect. You, on the other hand, are on thin ice. Help me get her back inside. (DRAMATIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) So what's the plan here? You hold him at gunpoint, tell him where to go. I'll follow right behind you to make sure he doesn't do anything crazy. Take him to Mom and Dad's cabin and I'll join you once you get there. So you really think taking him to a secluded place is gonna do anything? We're out of options. I was on board with what Kliff said until Noah shows up and murders a retired FBI agent right in front of us. We have to flip the script on him in some way. And breaking one of his rules, you know? I thought about that. All bets are off. Besides, if you're not cheating you're not trying, right? I guess we'll find out. Like you said, we're out of options. I'll be right behind you. We'll get him. It doesn't feel very good to be surprised by someone in the back of the car now, does it? Donnie, getting desperate, are we? We're going to for a little field trip. Start the car, keep both hands on top of the steering wheel as you drive so I can see. If you try anything funny I'll put a bullet in the back of your head and take my chances on finding Sara. Where are we going? For now, just take the highway up here. I'll give you the directions as needed from there. It's a secluded place where we can talk. And you're not in control anymore. What do you think this is going to accomplish? DONNIE: Well, I think it's time we had a little heart to heart. What would you like to talk about? You've always considered yourself the victim and me the antagonist. When all I am is an innocent bystander. Innocent? You cheat on your wife, kill mine, and you're innocent? My infidelity, yeah, it was a mistake. Your wife dying was an accident. What you don't seem to understand is that I know it was an accident. When I first began observing your life, Donnie, I was ashamed at first for my desire for revenge. I thought you loved Sara the same way I loved my wife. I do love Sara, more than anything. My mistake didn't change that. Cheating isn't a mistake, it's a choice. Accept that. Once I saw your love for Sara was fake, I knew you deserved everything that I would teach you. Teach me? Do you hear yourself? You think you're some sort of messiah or something? I have a purpose here, to teach you the lesson you couldn't learn on your own. Some lessons create more suffering than others. Well it's time for a new lesson. I believe in an eye for an eye. An eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind. You're no Gandhi. And you're no Jesus. Life is full of unintentional tragedies. You're not special, Noah. Removing Sara from the man who doesn't appreciate her will ruin your life and give hers new meaning. I will go as far as I need to for my wife's death to be redeemed. Did you say someone was following us? Yes, so don't think you have control of the situation, because you don't. Really? Then why isn't Teddy following us anymore? Have a nice walk home, prick. (SLOW DRAMATIC MUSIC) (MIKE GRUNTING) (TEDDY GRUNTING) (TEDDY GROANING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (TEDDY GROANING) Teddy, no, I didn't mean for this to happen. Why did you do this? It wasn't me. It's all Noah. This isn't what I wanted. Teddy, Teddy. Come on, stay with me. Teddy. Donnie, Donnie, no, it's not what it looks like. What the fuck? (MIKE GROANING) It was an accident. - An accident? - Yes. Like Noah's wife was an accident? Son of a bitch. (MEN GRUNTING) I didn't mean to kill him. I didn't want to be a part of any of this, Donnie. Please, you got to believe me. It wasn't my fault. (MEN GRUNTING) (DOOR KNOCKING) Oh my God. What happened? Haley, what have I become? What am I doing? I don't even know who I am anymore. If I'm capable of this, then maybe Noah was right, that I'm not worthy of Sara. What happened? Maybe she should have been taken from me. All I wanted to do was save her from that raving lunatic. But if I got to go through all this to do so, I can't. Donnie, tell me what happened. I killed him. I stabbed him over and over. You killed Noah? No, Mike, his brother-in-law. He's been involved in this the whole time. I went to Teddy's, walked in, and Mike killed my brother. He told me things. What if he was telling me the truth? You can't feel guilty about this. Noah's pushed us so far. We're bound to break eventually. Everybody has their limits. Limits? I never thought I'd be capable of actually murdering somebody. I think we're all capable of that when it comes to someone we love. Yeah. Yeah, maybe so, but I don't know if I can live like this. Anything we have to do to find them is worth it. You have to believe that. But am I doing it for the right reasons? What do you mean, the right reasons? Do I really love Sara? Or do I just want her to be mine? Love is a little bit selfish. You're letting Noah get in your head, just like you told me. Anything we have to do to find them is the right thing. Come on, let's get you cleaned up. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) What is that? Proof of who Donnie really is. You're sharing your life with a liar. What are you talking about? Look for yourself. (SIGHS) Your time has come. What does that mean? Well, your family didn't play the game with enough gusto to find you within the one week time limit, and well they both suffer the consequences of the broken rules. You've outlived your usefulness. No please, Sam didn't mean anything. He just gets angry sometimes. And that's your problem, Brook. You didn't stay with Sam because you loved him. You stayed with him out of fear. And I have no respect for people who live their lives in fear. (GUN FIRING) (BROOK SCREAMING) You crazy. I didn't do anything. My sister didn't do anything to you. Now you can just let me go. She proved unworthy. AUSTIN: What? You know, both your parents had died and you could have come together, love and support each other, but you turn on each other at the first opportunity out of self-preservation. No. Another thing I have no respect for. (GUN FIRING) Are you gonna look at that or what? Look at it. Look at it! Why should I look at it? It's just part of your game. You're just going to kill me like you killed them. Sara, nothing I've said has been a lie. Nothing I've done has been without reason. What's inside that folder is the truth of who Donnie is. What you do with that information will determine your fate. The truth can be a matter of perception. Perception of truth is still a lie. It's just something people do so they can sleep at night with their own inadequacy and weakness. I take a more transparent approach. Now look at it. Not who you thought he is, is he? These aren't real. These can't be real. I'm flattered. I mean, I know I'm good, but even I can't fake an entire mistress for Donnie. He did that all by himself. Why didn't you show this to me sooner? I needed to make sure you were ready for what comes next. You're not going to go anywhere, are you? - Get up. - Please. - Get up. - Please no. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sara, meet Peyton, Donnie's mistress. So this is the bitch he cheated on me with? Yes it is, Sara. What do you have to say for yourself? I'm sorry. I never meant to hurt anyone. I didn't mean to fall in love with him. It just, it just happened. It just happened? This doesn't just happen. I don't even know how to process this right now. I'm so sorry, Sara. I know Donnie loves you. That's why he broke it off with me. I promise, I didn't know he was married. Please, please just let me go. Let her go. Donnie's the one who cheated and not her. Just let her go. Too late - Oh my God. Why did you do that? Donnie is the one to blame. He's the one that broke his vows. He's the one that threw away the life that he promised me. He betrayed me. You finally learned, Sara. You're ready for what's next. - Come on. - What? Come on. Time to face the consequences, Haley. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (GRUNTING) Time to take your punishment for breaking my rules, Haley. Nobody breaks my rules and gets away with it. Fuck your rules, Noah. (HALEY GROANING) Enjoy your slow death, Haley. You earned it. (SLOW DRAMATIC MUSIC) Donnie, finally becoming the aggressor. Well it's time for this game to end. Maybe there's hope for you yet. Take me to Sara or I put a bullet through your skull. Okay. Coming? No more games. Are you taking me to Sara? It's time, you earned it. Don't try to pull anything though, just take me to Sara. I have anything left in this game, Donnie. Make yourself worthy before I return Sara. Worthy? That's a strange way to reward someone, you sick fuck. You have no idea. Shut up and take me to Sara. Is she alive? I already told you, we're even. (NOAH LAUGHING) DONNIE: I'm so sorry, Sara. You never deserved her, Donnie. She loved you unconditionally and you took advantage of her. Because you could never appreciate her, I took her away just like you took my wife from me. You son of a bitch. Did you kill her? Let's just say it's over. Finish it. (GUN FIRING) I'm so sorry, Sara. I'm sorry I couldn't save you. I'm sorry I didn't appreciate you more. I love you, Sara. Hello, Donnie. (DONNIE GRUNTING) Sara, why? Why? Because I gave you everything and you threw it away. (DONNIE GROANING) Bye, Donnie. (DRAMATIC ELECTRONIC MUSIC) (SLOW DRAMATIC MUSIC)
