(Heavy breathing) (Grunts) What the hell? You ain't no mannequin. This ain't Halloween, pal. Where do you think you're going, huh? (Groans) (Groans) (Man) Midwood, your time has come. No more shopping in the rain, no more trucking 45 miles to the Southern Mall - no, thank you! No more "Saturday night, and where are my kids?". And on a personal note, as a beloved parent, it gives me great personal pleasure to share with you this, our wonderful mall - the new Midwood Mall. (Applause, cheering) Melody? Believe me, Mr. Webster, it's perfectly alright. I do understand if you need someone a little more qualified. You can start tomorrow. Here's your uniform. Thank you so much, Mr. Webster, you won't be sorry - I'll do a real good job. Thanks a lot. The driving force, the person that is responsible for all of this, the Mayor of Midwood, Miss Karen Wilton. (Man) Alright, Karen! Thank you. Thank you all very much. Ladies and gentlemen, when I was campaigning for the office of Mayor of this city, I made you some promises, and today, we see our efforts come to fruition. Ladies and gentlemen, we have finally succeeded in putting Midwood on the map! - (Man 1) Alright! - (Man 2) Hear, hear! (♪ Pop music playing) (indistinct chattering) (Mayor) Today we have a new town center. - We have new jobs. - (Susie) Mel! Give me the good news. - (Gasps) You got it! Oh, that's great. - Yes. And as we complete each phase of the mall project, we'll light another section of the mall model. I don't know how she does it. She always looks so perfect. Ladies and gentlemen, phase one! Thank you! OK, folks, don't forget, I know some of you have already received your invitations to the Mall Investors 4th of July ceremony. Mark it on your calendar, and we'll see you all there. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Gasping) (Breathing heavily) Here, you guys. Thanks. Bye. (Laughs) (Both clearing throats) Melly, Susie, how you guys doing, huh? They let you handle the food? I promise not to spit in your yogurt. Ugh! I'll pass. She'll have a vanilla, Buzz. - OK... vanilla. - Trail mix. Here you go. Melody, what are you gonna have? - Um, I think I might have a vanilla also. - (Gasps) Oh, hey, hey... Hey, ears are extra. (Bizz) Mm... Mm, mm, mm... 9h, gross! I'd share with you guys, but really, look, there's not enough for three. - Buzz off, Buzz! - I heard that one before. - (Camera shutter clicking) - skylight over here. You've got four major department stores, sixty clothing stores, Speaking of which, gentlemen, if you're tired of this P.R. talk, we could stop here. Hello. - (Buzz) Can I help you? - (Mayor) I'll have a small vanilla, please. - Hello, ladies. - (Both) Hi! - You enjoying the mall? - Oh, it's great. - We both start working tomorrow. - Oh, great! Now, this is just what I'm talking about - new mall, new jobs. In fact... why don't we get a photograph with the ladies? - You don't mind, do you? - (Both) No... not at all! Oh, great! Thank you. Hi, how are you? - Thanks. - It's perfect. Now, if you would like to go downstairs with me, I'll be glad to show... - Hello. - Hi. I know this sounds corny, but you look familiar to me. You look familiar, too. That fire last year - I'm the one who took your picture when they brought you in. You have a good memory. That fire happened around here somewhere, didn't it? Yeah, you're standing on it. You know, you were pretty hysterical that night. I remember you kept saying you saw some guy. - Yeah, I saw him. - You said he had a medal in his ear? Yeah, some kind of religious symbol. I don't know about you, but that sounds suspicious to me. Yeah. But no one ever believed me. No investigation, nothing. Eric was murdered, and nobody cared. Wait! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to press you. It's my reporter's instincts getting out of hand again. I'm Peter. Peter Baldwin. I'm Melody Austin. - It's nice to meet you, Melody Austin. - It's nice to meet you. I am sorry... about your boyfriend. Thanks. I guess I'm just not over it yet, that's all. (Gasps) (Eric) 'Surprise!' - Mwah! - Thanks. You're welcome. Orchids! I love orchids. (Peter) What's the matter? (Chuckles) They're just orchids. You don't understand. Nice flowers. Mel? What's wrong? Buddy, I think it's time for a little talk. What's wrong? Look, I kinda overheard your conversation of yours and Mel's. - How? - I got this special talent called supersonic hearing. I mean, I can listen to one conversation while the whole time I'm, like, involved in another, man, it's weird. But I've been doing it since I was a kid. - I'm impressed. - Look, anyway... Look, I heard you were talking to Melody, right, and you gotta lay off her. I mean, she's really been through a lot. Why don't you let her tell me that? No. Nope, absolutely not, you can't borrow my car. No, you already wrecked two this month. Thanks a lot, Dad, OK? You know what? I'm just gonna take Mom's car. You little prick! I mean, she and Eric, I mean, they were the perfect couple. You know, they were so in love. And she's just starting to get back to a normal thing, a normal life, you know. So, what do you think? Was it arson? Beats me. I think someone dropped the ball on the investigation. Yeah, me too. - Hey! - Hey, watch it! See that kid? His dad owns this whole mall. Don't worry, jerks run in their family. - I didn't mean to upset her. - Don't worry about it. Melody doesn't talk to people she doesn't like. (Footsteps) (Heavy breathing) (Clicking) (Heavy breathing) (Groaning) (Indistinct chattering) This one's great. I knew I shouldn't have eaten that pizza last night. I hope it still fits. Relax, Suze, you look great in everything. (Man) Oh, yes, my dear! I think I recognize you. I do, both of you. (Laughs) Yeah. Now, don't leave it on the floor. You've gotta bend over and take it. Yes. (Laughs) Oh, God! (Chuckles) Oh, yeah, now look at these. They just look right up at you. Oh, yes, my dear! (Chuckling) Alright, here's a new one. Oh, yeah, come on, take it off. Oh, my God. Oh, yes. Now the bra. Yes... Oh, don't do that! Oh, man, I thought we were gonna have a show here. Hey, shut that damn thing off. Posner's coming in on five. There's some kind of strange knocking in the G section ventilation ducts. - Check it out. - Right, Chief. What the hell are you waiting on, asshole? - Go check it out. - Hey man, not now, come on! It'll go away by itself anyway. Get off your fat ass and go down there and check it out right now! (Sniffs) Son of a... (Indistinct whispering) Susie... look at this. It's beautiful. Oh, it's nice. Yeah, but it's expensive. My approach is simple - if you like it, buy it. Besides, you're employed now. I can't. I gotta save my money for college. "I gotta save my money for college. I gotta save my money for college." Don't you ever do anything on impulse? No. Hey, girls, you wanna pull my chain? (Laughs) (Heavy breathing) Gosh, that security guard was such a jerk. That's what I like about the mall - you meet charming guys like that. - Hello, ladies. - Hi! Have a nice day. (Knocking) (Knocking continues) (Humming) (Thud) (Screams) (Howling) - Harv, am I interrupting anything? - No, no, come on in. I'm just doing some initial work on my shop rental revenues. This mall is going to be a gold mine, and when I finish with my plans for expansion, there's gonna be even bigger bucks. Well, actually that's what I stopped by to talk to you about, Harv. First, I wanted to congratulate you on a very successful opening, and then I just thought you might be interested to know that there's some talk going on downtown about, um... supporting you for the city council. And if things keep going the way they have been around here, I might be persuaded to throw my support behind you, too. Oh, Karen, I... I want you to know that your guidance and support is of the utmost importance to me. I mean that. I mean that sincerely. Gee, Harv, you sound like you're running for office already. Oh, by the way, can you keep a leash on that son of your, Justin - I'm getting complaints from the shop owners already. Bye, Harv. Bye, Karen. Stop by anytime. (Rustling) Oh, shit! God! You like him. No, I don't. Come on, Melody, why can't you admit that you might be just a little attracted to Peter Baldwin? Well, I don't even know him. How can I be attracted to him? Well, he can ask me probing questions anytime. (Chuckles) - He is pretty cute, huh? - Uh-huh. You OK getting to your car? Yeah, other than they make me walk to Timbuktu I'll be fine. - Night, Mel. - Bye, Suze. (Engine turns over) (Shrieks) No! (Grunts) (Shrieks) (Groaning) Are you alright? I... I don't understand. This is Posner. I may be requiring your services again. So, the only thing that you remember about him is that he walked with a limp. Yeah, and that somebody, I don't know who, shot him in the arm with an arrow. OK, um... Look, I'll take you home, and then I'll report it to the police. I know they're gonna wanna talk to you, but for tonight, why don't you just try to get some rest? OK. (Grunts) (Screams) Pete! Have I got a scoop for you! You know, this could be the big one. Yeah, thanks, Buzz, but I'm looking for Melody. Uh, where does she work? Look, that's no problem, pal. All I need is to take a moment out of your valuable schedule just to accompany me. Come on! - Do I have a choice? - No. - Deal. - Let's do it. OK. Now, this is unbelievable. (Grunting) One Nautilus exercise machine, one crossbow, three pillows, one mannequin's head, one VCR, two video cameras, one tape recorder - all missing. Well, you look into it and find out what the hell's going on. And Devin, he didn't show up yet this morning. - I fired him last night. - What? Don't worry, I already hired a replacement. What about the other guy? - What guy? - Stanley. He worked the night shift. We haven't heard from him since. - Another guard? - Huh? Nothing. Nothing, I just... meant that he probably got himself another job. Right. And let it be known that we will prosecute shoplifters to the fullest extent of the... law. I'll catch you later, Chief. Goddammit! How many times have I... How many times have I told you not to... (Laughs) Yeah, Dad. Too many, Dad. Too many.

Watch this. - (♪ Music starts playing) - Hey, shh! Turn that stuff off! Look, it's only in here. The public address system's off, they can't hear us. Listen to what it does to your body. Oh, it's unbelievable. Oh, yeah! Oh! Oh, God! Oh! Oh, it's real nice, huh? Muzak is not exactly big news, Buzz. Look... Watch this. (Woman over speaker) 'The sales clerks are my friends.

What's the big deal? - Gotta go. - Wait... Pete... This is just great. Well, thank you, Buzz. (♪ Pop music playing) (Camera shutter clicking) (♪ Whistling) (Woman shrieks) Excuse me! Excuse me! (Woman) Hey! - (Roars) - Shit! (Inaudible) Come on! (Groans) (Groans) Hey! So, if you could just take those papers over to... Excuse me, Mayor. Boy, am I glad to see you. Oh, you're the young man from the paper, aren't you? Right. Look, I'd like to take your picture for our weekend section. Do you mind? No, not at all. Always glad to oblige the press. Great. (♪ Pop music playing) (Heavy breathing) Mel! 'You're not gonna believe this. We're famous.' (Melody) We are! Front page news. That's Peter's picture. Listen, I gotta go. I'll talk to you later, OK? Thanks, Suze. Hey, Buzz, where's Melody? She's working over at Sleuth's. Why, what happened, Pete? - Gotta go. - Hey, Pete. Huh, that's great. Hey, hey, hey! Wait, Suze, just one second. - Hi, Buzz. - Look, OK, I got a special today. OK? I got free yogurt... for an incredibly buxom young woman who gets her picture on the front page of Thursday's paper. Are you free tonight? Thanks, Buzz, but no thanks. (Gasps) An eye! Nice try, Buzz. (♪ STAN BUSH: "Heart Of Darkness") - ♪ I feel the night time call... ♪ - Melody, I got to talk to you. - Peter. - Oh, come here, this is important. I think I just saw the guy who started the fire at Eric's house. - Where? - Here, in the mall. Look, he had the same medal you described to me hanging from his ear. Look, I got a picture of him. I want you to take a look at it once it's developed. There's something else wrong here, isn't there? Yeah. First the flowers, then yesterday I go to my car, and there was something left in my car. It was the same dress that I wanted to buy but I couldn't afford. Then, right before you came in, I went and I punched some numbers on the jukebox, and this song started playing. So, somebody screwed up the records in the jukebox. No! This was Eric's and my song. Peter, it's like he's still around. I know he's still around. Listen, I saw the way you looked at the flowers yesterday. Brought back some memories, huh? Eric always gave me orchids. It's tough to lose somebody you care about. I'd really like to see that picture when you get it developed. Great. Look, I'll bring it by later. So, this man could still be lurking here at the mall. Now, the girl said he wore a black ski mask and he walked with a limp. And then somebody rescued her by shooting him in the arm with an arrow. An arrow? Yeah, well, that should make things easier. Just look for a man dragging an arm and a leg. We'll do our best, Mayor Wilton. Excuse me, ladies. It's time for my break. (Breathing heavily) (Heavy breathing continues) (Hissing) Agh... (Groans) (Hissing) (Water pattering) (Hissing) Oh, my God! (Hissing) (Screams) No! (♪ Pop music playing) Come on, Susie, it's Buzz! Let's just dance. Come on, just for a sec. - No, Buzz, I don't want to dance. - Look, it's so much fun, though. (Heavy breathing) Here, take a look at this. Peter... I don't know. I mean... I can't tell. Sorry, it's not my best work. No, no, that's OK. It's just... If he's a security guard here, can't we check with the security office? I already described him to the main office. - They said they never heard of him. - Oh, come on! - You don't believe that, do you? - No. 'I don't trust them. They're not gonna tell me about what happened.' Maybe this all ties in somehow. I'm gonna call you after work. You call me when you're through, and be careful. Peter... Thanks a lot for being such a friend. It's been real hard for me to open up with anybody else... since Eric. I really loved him a lot. Let me show you something else. How's this? What the hell do you mean, my son's hanging around Windsor's? I told that little bastard that the mall was off limits. I know, sir, and I was gonna escort him off the premises, but I thought you might want to handle it a little more discretely. Discretely, huh? Yeah. I'll discretely kick his ass out the exit door. Hair alright? - See you tomorrow, Sue. - Good night, Terry. - The store's closed. - Oh, that's OK. Well, you'll have to come back tomorrow. We open first thing in the morning. You know, I've seen you around a lot lately, and you are looking so good. (Susie) 'The store's closed.' - (Grunts) - You know, you are really cute. We could get to be friends. Close friends. I think you'd better leave. I've got to lock up. (Justin) 'Maybe you need some convincing.' (Panting, grunting) 'Baby, don't be like that. You know, my dad owns this place.' Could be helpful for you, you know. You don't have a prayer, asshole. I'm calling security. - Come here. - (Posner) Hey! - What the hell are you doing in here? - I'm looking for a job, Dad. You get the hell out of my mall, and I don't want to see your face until after the opening ceremony. OK, Dad. Teenagers, you know how they are. Yeah. Chip off the old block. (Woman) I just want to get a catalogue. (Man) Alright. - Who was that? - I don't know. Come on, let's get out of here. (Groans) (Choking) Shut it off! (Grunting) (Choking) (Grunting continues) Now, listen, I've been thinking about this all day, piecing it together - it's starting to make sense. There's only one thing left to find out, and we can do that tonight. I think I know what's going on. I just need to verify some facts. You have to tell me what happened at Eric's house that night. Peter, I can't. I know it's painful, but if you ever want to get to the bottom of this, you have to tell me what happened. We went to Eric's house that night. 'It was about eleven o'clock, I think. 'Remember how all the developers had the houses condemned?' (Peter) 'Yeah?' 'Well, they left a notice on Eric's door. 'God, he was so mad.' These goddamn developers are really pissing me off. They're still bugging you guys? Yeah, they won't stop hassling my mom and dad. Hey... Let's not let it spoil our evening, OK? OK. My parents are asleep. (Chuckling) He actually was really sweet that night, though. He gave me orchids. And he played our song. Mm... Thanks for the flowers. It was nice. It's my pleasure. Are you sure you want to hear this? Yeah, please go on. Well, we were - you know... 'You know... 'And... And then all of a sudden, it just happened.' Do you smell something? - (Shrieking) - Oh, my God! Eric, be careful! Mom! Dad! (Strains) (Grunts) - Eric! - Go on! Go on! (Shrieks) - (Screaming) - Hold on! Hold on! (Continues screaming) 'Eric saved me... 'but he didn't get out. 'I... I don't know, I mean, I don't really remember. I hit my head. 'That's when I saw him.' (Sirens wailing) It was so awful, Peter. Hey. It's OK. It's almost like a bad dream, you know. Yeah. I think I know what's going on. See if this makes any sense to you. The guard with the earring has got to be the guy that you saw at Eric's house that night. Now he's working here at the mall, and nobody in Mall Administration seems to know who he is. Somebody is covering up for him. But who? Posner? - (Whispers) Posner. - But why? Because Eric's family wouldn't move out. They must've hired the guard with the earring to torch Eric's house, the guy you saw that night. But why would he come around now? Peter... What if Eric didn't really die in that fire? It would explain a lot of things. The song on the jukebox, the flowers... Yeah, and the dress in my car. - There's one way to prove it. - How? We see if Eric's really buried at Walkers Grove. The grave's empty - we'll know he's alive. Peter, we can't. There's no other way. Oh, God! (Gun clicks) Out! Get out. Out! Turn around. You remember me, huh? Huh? I remember you. What the hell are you looking at? You keep your eyes forward, you hear me? (Panting) Yeah, you remember me. We've been friends for a long time. You go first. Argh... argh! (Clears throat) Volker to Unit Two. Volker to Unit Two, in pursuit. 'Southbound, six-yellow, brown Chevy wagon.' I'll head him off at orange-three, maintain pursuit. (Gasps) Peter, look out! Cut 'em off! Oh, shit! Damn! (Gasps) Watch out! (Indistinct shouting) Son of a... Shit! Shit! (Groaning) (coughing) Look... Look, Peter, maybe we should think about this. I mean, not only is this illegal, it's sacrilegious. Only if he's in here. This place is giving me the creeps. You OK? OK. Here goes nothing. I knew it! That was Eric tonight. And Mayor Wilton, I know this may sound crazy, but we believe that the house was burned down for the property. We think that Posner's responsible. Now, if that were true, he would be guilty of murder. That's a very heavy accusation. Eric Matthews is still alive. I want to believe you. But this is hard to accept. Well, what can we do? Find Eric Matthews. God damn you! What do you mean, they know? If you had done your job right, we wouldn't be in this mess right now. I'll take care of it. Why don't you just wear a friggin' sign, "I did it"? So help me God, that's coming off right now! Over my dead body it's coming off. Hmm? OK. Do it tomorrow. It's time, pretty lady. (Gasps) (Rustling) (♪ Pop music playing) - (Peter) 'Hello?' - Peter, it's me. I just saw Christopher. (Screams) Melody? (Shrieks) (Grunting) (Choking) Shh, shh, shh...! It's time, pretty lady. (Screaming, grunting) (Shrieking) (Groans) (Grunting) (Straining) (Choking) (Grunting) (Screams) (Bones crunching) (♪ Pop music playing) - Hey, Pete. - Look, have you seen Melody? No, not since this afternoon. What's going on? I think she might be in trouble. I gotta find her. - Look, I've got an idea. - I gotta go. It really is a good idea. We relying on this party to impress the investors. I understand. So, I think it would be best if security was a little less conspicuous. Yes, sir. - Suze... - Buzz, what are you doing here? Listen, we gotta find Melody. She's in some big trouble. Look, I'm sorry, pal. (Rustling) Hello, Eric. (Heavy breathing) I'm sorry about the way I look. I always knew you were alive. I knew it! You were watching over me, weren't you? Yeah. Nobody will ever hurt you, Melody. Nobody. I won't allow it. Please don't be afraid. (Heavy breathing) Oh, Melody. I always knew we'd be together again. (Indistinct chattering) Excuse me, Mayor. Oh, yes. Excuse me just a moment. - Peter, anything? - No. Look, have you seen Melody? No, not since last night. Why? - I think Melody might be in trouble. - I think some people need your attention. - Please excuse us. - Um... um, Peter, keep me posted. Yeah. Jesus! Buzz, what kind of ridiculous thing are you up to? We gotta get him out of here. I got an idea. Shh, shh, shh... Now be quiet. (Sighs) I'm glad that's over. I'm not. OK, come on, we did it. Now let's just get out of here. OK, come on, come on. Shh, shh, shh... OK, now look. See, there's cameras everywhere. If she's in the mall, we're gonna find her. Just... right here. (Pressing buttons) Come on. Come on, baby. - Hold it, Buzz. - What? Those keys on the floor. Come on. Let's get out of here. - Is this where you've been the whole time? - Yeah. Told you I had a place below my house. You know, a place I used to work out, hang out... It was my special place. Well, this is it. Well... Well, what's left of it. Let me show you something. OK? Wait right here. Let me show you something. They're for you. Purple was always your favorite color. Put it on for me. I'm sorry, Eric, I can't. I got this for you! I got this all for you! I can't! It's him, isn't it? Isn't it? Remember when we were kids? Remember that? When we vowed that we would always be together, that we would never let anything tear us apart, well, I respected that vow! I'm sorry, Eric, things have changed. (indistinct chattering) Buzz! The keys. Why is the vent open? - Do you think she...? - Come on, she must have. Let's go. (Grunts) Hello? Hello? Can anybody hear me? (Laughter) (Woman) Oh, this is delicious! Oh, this looks good, very good. Time to make money. - Lots of money. - Thank you. (Beeping) We have absolutely no idea where we're going... or what we're doing. There must be a billion vents that lead to God knows where. Look, Suze, we're just acting on a hunch, alright? I mean, cops do it all the time. Let's just... Great! Now which way? Argh! Whoa! (Shrieks) No! Eric, no! Shut up! You're not going anywhere. Eric, I don't belong here. I got this all for you, Melody, so we could be together. (Grunts) Eric, I can't stay here. You will stay here! I won't let you go... ever! Eric, I can't! - I have a life up there. - No! No! Without me, you have no life. (Melody shrieks) Once I've destroyed what's above, I'll join you here. Then we'll be together... forever. You can't. Too late. Soon it'll all be blown to shreds and them with it. A bomb? Eric, no! - You can't! - It's done. It's done. (Hissing) Argh! - You're insane. - I will have my revenge, Melody. And not you or anybody else is gonna do anything about it. They'll pay for what they've done. I'm only sorry... you won't be sharing it with me. (Knocking) (Peter) Melody! (Grunting) No! Eric! (Roars) (Grunting) (Melody) No! No, Eric! I love him! No! I love him! (Grunting) The flames are blocking the exit. How are we gonna get out of here? And as proud as we are of Midwood Mall, it won't be complete until we finish the Midwood Monumental Spire. (Melody shrieks, snake hisses) (Hissing) (Fire crackling) (Melody gasps) Grab on to it. We all want to see this one last section lit as a symbol to Midwood, of the prosperity we hope this represents for generations to come. Hear something? Sounds like it's really coming... Buzz? Thank you all very much. Thanks so much for your support. Now, just keep it up! And we're delighted that you were able to share this momentous occasion with us. Thank you, have a good time! (Beeping) We'd better go warn everybody. Look, there's Karen. - Hi, Karen. Look... - What happened to you? We've got to evacuate the place. There's a bomb. Now, I can't let you wreck this nice party, can I? Just turn around... and head back the way you just came. Look, just come on! Get in here. Go, go, go, go... You mean you know how to drive one of these things? I'm a quick learner. OK, what's this part? OK, this is the ignition. Posner was supposed to take care of this earlier today. Of course he botched it. You and Posner? Why? Because I'm a major stockholder in this mall. That means major profits! This is my ticket out of here. And who do you think covered up for the arson? Posner? Listen, there's still a bomb in this mall. A bomb underneath the mall... Oh, come on! You're gonna have to do better than that. (Melody shrieks) (whimpering) (Screams) (Gasping) (Posner) Excuse me, please! Excuse me! Oh, Jesus Christ! Look! Up there! - (Man) Look, up there! - (Crowd shouting indistinctly) - (Woman) Somebody... call the police! - (Man) Who is it? (Beeping) Ladies and gentlemen, please don't panic, but the mall must be evacuated immediately clue to a bomb threat. Please move calmly and carefully to the nearest exit. 'Start at Sam Goody's, Sleuth's, 'Windsor Fashion... The police have been notified. 'Please move calmly and carefully. 'Ladies and gentlemen, please don't panic, 'but the mall must be evacuated immediately clue to a bomb theat.' Wait! Wait! Don't leave! This is... Everything's gonna be alright. This is just a publicity stunt. Wait! Please! No! No! (Sobs) No! No, please! No! - (Shrieks) - (Peter) Melody, no! - Hang on! - (Melody shrieking) Help me! (Shrieks) No! No! Peter! Help! (Gunshot, Eric grunts) Kill that son of a bitch! (Gunshot) (Gunshot) (Gunshot, grunting) Posner! (Screams) Look what you did to me! - Look what you did to me! - Eric? Eric... Look, we can compromise.
