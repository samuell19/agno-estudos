[Christmas bells chiming] [joyful Christmas music playing] [sighs] Getting an early start on lunch? Nope. I'm working on something new, butternut squash risotto for Christmas. It sounds delicious. Tried it last night, but the ingredient ratios were all messed up. Keep getting distracted. By what? So I'm partway through this painting, and I was finishing it in my head now. You can't let your painting be the cause of wasted food. Right. How would you like to rustle us up some breakfast? Can you make your father's smoked salmon scrambled eggs? I can. Can't make it as well as he did, though. Yes, you can. Your father would be so proud of you the way you've just stepped in and made this restaurant your own. Smoked salmon it is. You should paint a picture of yourself to go with your picture of your father. I don't think so. I didn't even want you to put up the photograph of me. I'm no equal of Dad. And it's pretty apparent that the customers agree. Stop that. It's getting steadily better, and Christmas is always great for us. Oh, I got to go to town and meet Ella to take care of something. - I'll be back for lunch service. - Just come back in time for Ella's shift. The staff can look after the kitchen for lunch. Have fun! Thanks. [joyful Christmas music playing] Why are we here? This is my happy place. You okay? The walls are empty. Yeah, but can't you feel the artist creating art for the contest? If you say so. You love creating dishes. That's your art. I mean, I do too, but... - You think I'm a good chef? - You're terrific. Then why is this my happy place? Because you have a soul of a painter. Soul of a painter? Okay, I saw it in a movie, but it fit the moment, didn't it? So where's your happy place? You know, the restaurant. The day you moved me from desserts to sous chef was the second best day of my life. Well, I'm sure your husband would be happy to hear he beat sous chef. Gabe supports my dreams. You need someone like that. After the disaster that was Jeff, I'm fine alone. And I have a lot going on. I started painting again. Well then... you need to submit to the art festival. - That's why we're here. - Consider me shocked. I took over the restaurant about a year ago, and Mom said it's starting to come back, so I thought, "Why not?" Do you ever wonder what would have happened if you went straight to art school after graduation rather than sticking around the restaurant? Well, Charlie's Kitchen isn't just a restaurant. It's my family's lifeblood. I can never leave it behind. Especially now. If you're looking for support, I absolutely believe you could win this art competition. Come on! You know it's true! I started something. It's very Christmas-y. No, no, wait. I have a better idea. You could paint me. I look very cute in Christmas outfits. [giggles] I'll definitely win then. Absolutely. That's a great idea. - You should've told me this days ago. - I have all the good ideas. [peaceful Christmas music playing] [man] Knock knock. David. You were supposed to call me when you got in so I could pick you up. I just grabbed a rideshare. It was easier than bothering you. Aww! - Ooh! - Good to see ya. Having you here for Christmas is, like, the best thing ever. It's a double win for me. I get to see your new place and spend the holidays with you. - Mm. - Bayside is a big change from New York. Yeah, and that's exactly how we like it. Hey, I hope you're okay with this whole garage vibe. - No. - You know, I hope this works. It's different from what you're used to but... Works for me. I started out in the garage. One more picture to finish and then I'm yours until the next corporation calls. Score. Oh, hey. I actually kept my old sketching desk from our days in New York. And don't worry. Your original masterpiece is still intact. Wow. Look at that. A stone-age cave drawing. Whoa! This is a Wyatt Graham original. How much do you think I could get for it? My originals are computer-generated these days, so unless we can find a hotel lobby this will work in, I don't think anyone's going to be interested, but enough about me, come on. Yeah, not quite. Cheryl is going to need a lot more, and she's definitely going to ask about Michelle. And I'm going to tell her what I tell everyone else. She wanted to settle down. I wasn't ready. Not ready to stop traveling? I love the places I get to go. I'm just... I'm not artistically satisfied. [unzips bag] I used to use pencils to create my drawings and now everything is computer-generated. There's no human element to the finished product anymore. I get it, and so... I've gone ahead and done something. [chuckles] What did you do? I have entered you in the City Christmas Art Festival. - Hmm. - So it's time to put up or get mad at me. Or maybe... maybe thank you. Hey, what are friends for? The contest is Christmas-themed. So I was thinking, hey, you know, you could just enter this, and then you don't have to create anything new. Nah, no way. It's a lot to process, but I love a challenge. And, hey, it could be fun. [David] All right. I'll need supplies. I got you covered on that. There's a shop downtown. - Perfect. - Let's go get some food. Okay. [David] I got this. [carefree Christmas music playing] - Hey, welcome back. - I just came in to drop Ella off. I forgot my work shoes so I need to go home. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. Hurry back. - Hey, Patrick. - Charlotte, boy, am I glad to see you. - I got a question for you. - Sure. What's up? There's been a hiccup in the Christmas festival planning. Is there a chance that Charlie's Kitchen could come on as our official restaurant? Really? What happened? I thought Home Cooking was doing it this year and every year. Yeah, well, Brenda hurt her back, and she's out for at least two weeks. - Oh. - I need someone and thought of you first. Well, thank you for that, but... Not all of the events need food. Just three of them. Just the opening holiday party, the Christmas Art Festival Showcase, and the Yuletide Gala. Um... Well, you know, I love the festival, but the opening's tomorrow. I would be grateful for whatever you put together, it doesn't have to be fancy. I just... I don't have anyone else I trust to handle this on such late notice. Yes? I mean, I'm sure my mom would love the publicity for the restaurant. Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. You have no idea how much this means. You are saving the day. Is your mom in the back? Yeah, she is. Tell her I said yes? Thanks, Charlotte. No. [sighs] Hey, what are you doing? I'm fixing the picture. Can't have a messed-up Santa at Christmas. Oh, really? Yeah, whoever drew this is pretty good too. - Pretty good? - Absolutely. Is there something that you'd do differently? Maybe I would put a Christmas tree right here in the background. Hmm. I'd prefer a sleigh. Yes, but the public would be expecting a sleigh. Plus, I get to decorate a tree. You? [scoffs] My board, my decorations. I might let you draw a tree 'cause I can always erase it. And you are? The pretty good artist. Oh, well, in that case, I'll just take the tree. Okay, Rembrandt, but if you mess it up, you got to answer to the owner. Which I'm guessing is probably you. Yep. Well, I'm willing to chance it. [sighs] Hey, artist at work. My board. Okay. Your turn. Artist at work. Okay. You're better than pretty good. - So are you. - Well, thank you. - And you are? - I'm Wyatt. - Charlotte. - Your restaurant? Any good? It is! I'm also the head chef. You're invited to try it. Sounds good to me. I'd love to try. Right now, I'm just headed to the craft store, but... this was fun. - I'll be seeing you, Charlotte. - Hope so. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Right, shoes. [jolly Christmas music playing] One quick touch-up. [ringtone playing] - Hey, Ella. - [Ella] Hey. Are you coming back anytime soon? Uh, yeah. I'll be right there. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. It's really good to see you again. Happy holidays. - You made the shoes? - Sorry, I got distracted. [Ella] Distracted with painting? Mm. [chuckles] Your mom wants to talk to us about some big news. - I already know all about it. - Am I being promoted? - Am I finally your boss now? - You already got a promotion. Oh, well, I'm impatient. Don't wish for too much because Mom's news is going to tax your cooking skills. Huh, yeah. Good, that's news I want to hear. The art festival has last-minute food needs, and we have been asked to save the day. - I thought... - Brenda hurt her back. The Yuletide Gala will be here? Yep, on the 22nd. Plus, two more events. The Gala means out-of-town reporters, articles, blogs. - Mm-hmm. - People all over the country see them. - This could put us on a bigger map. - I know it could be nice. We have to hit the ground running. The opening party is tomorrow. So we'll meet here in the morning. Early. And for now, let's get on that dinner rush. Come on. [contemplative music playing] I couldn't sleep. I saw the light on. Why are you still up? I'm just unwinding, fooling around. Don't stay up all night. I am worried about tomorrow. I need you to be fresh. I'll be fine. I'm sorry, I don't mean to push, but could this... project wait until tomorrow? - Sure... - Or after the festival? - Oh, absolutely. - That would be better. Okay. Thank you. I'm counting on you. Of course. You can always count on me. Good night. [cheery Christmas music playing] [David straining] [sighs] - What you got there? - Free Christmas decorations. Who's going to argue with free? You know, people around here always go all out for the holidays. Yeah, I noticed. And what's... what's this? Oh, it's just something by the box, I think someone was just throwing it out. [Wyatt] No, this is half-finished. Just toss it then. - I don't think so. - You want to keep it? Yeah. Okay. [cheery Christmas music playing] Are you really okay with all this extra work? Why wouldn't I be? I figured both work and getting your painting done for the contest would be too much. - How are you going to do both now? - Don't worry about me. The restaurant has my complete attention. You submitted it already? Nope, I threw it away. - You what? - Mm-hmm. You need me. My mom needs me. Everyone needs me. - It's for the best. - No, it's not. Come on. Look, as much as I love painting, last night, I saw how overwhelmed my mom was with all of this. If she can't sleep, then it's serious. So work over hobbies, right? I don't want you to do something you're going to regret. No, it's... it's for the best. [patrons chatting indistinctly] Well, look who it is. Oh, hi. This is a nice surprise. - Are you offering caricatures? - No. - Mm-hmm. - Don't mind if I do. Thank you. Oh, that's good. You know what else is really good? That painting. [peaceful Christmas music playing] You okay? You look like you've seen the ghost of Christmas past. - Worse. - What happened? Nothing. I'm okay. I just... I hallucinated. I mean, like, I hope I hallucinated. Oh, I get it. Seeing everyone else's artwork out there isn't easy. Next year is going to be your year, okay? Mm-hmm. We should get back to serving food. - Would you like some more wine? - Oh, no, thanks. Are you okay? Did I do something to upset you? You just disappeared. You're Wyatt... Graham, the architectural artist? - You've heard of me? - I have a coffee table book of your work. You must like hotel lobbies. I like art. Mm-hmm. So do I. You know, I find it really strange that the only art with your name on it isn't even yours. I'm not trying to steal anyone's thunder. I'm going to submit my own work. I just... I love what there is of this. You don't happen to know who the artist is, do you? Yeah, I do. And you should take it down. If the artist wants to tell me in person, I'd be happy to. Let's just say the artist threw it away for a reason. I can't imagine what would make an artist throw out a work like this. I can. Even half finished, there's nothing like it in here. Everyone's talking about it. Well, it would be better if they were talking about the food. Excuse me. Charlotte, we are making a great impression up there. - Everyone seems to love the food. - All thanks to your and Ella's work. Well, it's the job, Mom. It's... my only focus right now. That's why you're the best. [laughs] Good night. Thanks so much for coming. Well, I think we pulled it off. And I'd say the food was pretty perfect. - Oh, thank you. - I got to say, you look amazing. Oh, stop it. Well, it has been a while since I've been this dressed up. Oh, well, then I need to host a few more of these. I was wondering, are you coming to the Color Me Christmas event tomorrow? I wasn't planning on it. Charlotte's the artist, I'm the numbers gal. Oh, that's too bad. Thought you might use it as another opportunity to promote your restaurant. Lots of out-of-towners never heard of Charlie's Kitchen. You've got a point. - Just think about it. - I'm thinking. Well, I hope I see you tomorrow, Molly. Good night. What was that about? He wants me to go to Color Me Christmas. Really? You should definitely go. Well, I would be promoting the restaurant if I brought some of our hot spice cider. That works. Business and some pleasure. - Mm-hmm. - Just business. If you say so. Okay, Wyatt. What do we draw? [whimsical music playing] - Hi. - Sorry, we don't open for another... hour. I was just taking a walk and I thought, "olive branch." Last night I gave you the wrong impression about why I hung the painting up. I'm listening. I wasn't trying to take credit away from the artist. I was just trying to spotlight the art that spoke to me. Well, I love that it spoke to you, but what if the artist isn't interested in having the art seen? That's a fair question, but why wouldn't they be? It's complicated. I hear the next event is some public painting thing today. You want to come with me? I'm not much of a painter and maybe you can give me some pointers. I'll think about it. Can't ask for more than that. I'll head over early and save you a seat just in case. The mystery man you were hanging around with last night has followed you here? His name is Wyatt. He's a well-known artist. He seems like a... interesting guy, but, um... But what? But we have unfinished business. Oh, like your unfinished painting hanging at the gallery? I'd know your style anywhere. Well, only you, and now Wyatt, know that. I should have known you wouldn't throw it out. But I did. I threw it in the trash. I don't even know how he got his hands on it. I'm failing to see the problem. Based on what I heard, you could win. It's a half-finished painting, nothing that I'd want anyone seeing in its current form. With the restaurant responsibilities, I can't finish it if I wanted to. I just... I'm going to take it down. - I am. - You had a chance to last night. Well, people were talking, and I, you know, like, I didn't want to... Take it down. Well, I do now. Well, I think you should accept the nice artist man's invitation today, even if it is to tell him you want your painting back. Can I at least know more about him? [laughs] There's... there's nothing to say. Tell me you don't want to know more about him. I already know about him. Well, I mean, I know what he does for a living. Like, I mean, I know his career. I don't know him personally, but it's the same... You must want to know more because you're talking in circles. Okay, I'll go if it'll make you happy, but only to tell him that I'm taking the painting down. Mm-hmm. Right. Yeah. Just for that reason. - Yep. - Just for that. [laughing] [sighs] Not bad. I thought I heard you coming in. What are you doing home and dressed like that? Ella has the kitchen covered today so I was going to Color Me Christmas. Oh, you are such a good daughter. I could use a second set of hands with the spice cider. Oh, I'm happy to help. I'll take care of the cider. You know, if you are looking this good, I should step up my game too. I'm sure Patrick would like that. He never crossed my mind. Right, right. Oh, you just... [giggles] [joyous Christmas music playing] [indistinct chatter] Charlie's Kitchen cider? Enjoy. So my invitation was just too irresistible to pass up. You got lucky, I was working. - It's a nice place to work. - Mm-hmm. I love the boats. Yeah, it's an outdoor boat museum. They're part of the town's history. You know, your station here looks like it's self-sufficient. Why not come join me at an easel? Uh... I should really stay here. People can figure out how to fill their own cups. - Okay, wise guy. Let's go. - All right. I warn you, though, using a brush is way different than using a pencil. - [Charlotte] Ready for your lesson? - I am. Wait, it's turning into, like, a watercolor. - Yeah, that should work. - All right. So get some green. [Wyatt] Green, green. - All right. - No. You hold it like this. - Oh. - Yeah. - Almost like a pencil. - Kind of. - All right. - Just let the brush do the work, okay? - Hold on. - How's that? - [Charlotte] Here, just let me... - Sure. Close your eyes. Just feel it. [contemplative music playing] Yeah! Look, you can do it. [both laugh] [Wyatt chuckles] [joyous Christmas music playing] Hey, you made it. I did. They really like our cider. Yeah, we've had a lot of folks in and out today. I saw a lot of people over here so that's good. Well, thank you for inviting us to do this. You should go look at what Charlotte is painting. She has a talent. She likes to paint. It's a good release for her, I guess. It's been fun spending this holiday time with you. I'd have to agree. So, what big city do you live in? Well, what makes you think I'm from a big city? - Really? - [laughs] All right, New York, but I travel so much for each gig, I can barely say I live there. And you came to Bayside, why? To visit my good friend, David. He's the one who encouraged me to enter the art contest. You mean enter someone else into the art contest? I'm going to enter. I just haven't figured out what I want to draw yet. Well, Bayside has some beautiful buildings. I'm tired of architectural drawing. Well, I like them. They're so precise, so... Dry? Unemotional? - Do they move you? - Yes. I love them. Well, I... I always thought they were cold. I mean, I want to bring warmth and life to my work. Like your work. Even half painted, your work shows so much more than mine. No, but thank you. Believe me, I know where you're coming from, though. So many people have been dictating what I create for them. I just... I want to create something for myself. Well, there's nowhere more inspirational than Bayside at Christmas. I'll be first in line to see what you submit. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Okay. Well, what about you? You are clearly a talented artist. Why are you working as a chef? Sometimes being there for your family is what's most important. Well, if only someone would understand the value of chasing your dreams. You're dreaming if you think you're gonna finish that by dark. - More painting, less talking. - Okay. Charlotte, that is so pretty. [Charlotte] Thank you. - Okay. Be honest. - Okay. Uh... It's good. Ah. You know, tomorrow's festival event is Kringle's Krafts in the art gallery. You could do a demonstration with pencil. You know, try out some ideas on the people there? I bet you they would love to see you work. Seriously? I haven't drawn with a pencil in a while. You could do it. And Patrick would love it. Would you come? [clicks tongue] I just might, after work. I'm holding you to that. You know, I think I'm gonna go burn this now. - No! - Yeah. [Charlotte laughs] - See you at Kringle's Krafts tomorrow? - Tomorrow. Bye. Bye. He looks nice. Wyatt? Oh, he has a name? Yeah, he knows mine too. That's a good start. I am so glad you're getting back out there. [Charlotte sighs] That is very nice. Very nice. [peaceful Christmas music playing] - Hey, man. - [Wyatt] Hey. I thought I'd add a little more Christmas cheer in here to help get those creative juices flowing. Love it. Did you fish another painting out of the trash? No, this one's all mine. But you were blindfolded, right? [chuckles] I had my eyes closed for part of it, but I'm not a painter. Let's see that. Okay. Then why did you paint this? [Wyatt chuckles] Have you and Cheryl already had dinner? I was thinking about getting takeout from Charlie's Kitchen. - It's good food. - Yeah. And between you and me, the chef there turned out to be the creator of that painting you found. Okay, I like where this is going. - So, chef, huh? - Yeah. You going there for the food or you're going to see her? Both. [David chuckles] [peaceful Christmas music playing] - [Wyatt] Hello. - Hi. Is it too late to place an order before closing? Of course not, but we need to talk. Have a seat. I'm sorry. Have we met? No. No, I'm Ella. I'm Charlotte's best friend, and she's not here right now, which is good for us. Look, I don't know how you ended up with Charlotte's painting, but you clearly thought it was something special if you submitted it to the festival. - It is. She's a rare talent. - Mm-hmm. And she finally decided to enter the contest this year until you cut her off at the knees. I didn't know that, but she also threw the painting out. Well... there is that. But I was going to talk her back into entering and... that's going to be harder to do with that half-finished painting hanging there. Hmm. What do you suggest? Let her take it down if that's what she wants to do. You know, I can do with some more friends like you. I'm glad you understand. - I love Charlotte. - I like her too. Thought so. [Wyatt chuckles] Now, will that be dine-in or takeout? Takeout? Takeout. [pan rattling] Hey. So, I was thinking about the Gala. We really need to shine, you know, bring our A-game. So I thought Christmas: something new, something different. Butternut squash risotto. Hm? Sure you want to do something new instead of what we know our customers love? Hundred percent. - Honey? - Hmm? What's going on? You know, it's just a lot of things. My responsibilities here, I mean, which is my priority. I'm also enjoying the company of a man who's about to leave town. I have conflicted feelings about that. And I just want to express myself through my paintings. I'm just feeling... Overwhelmed. You don't think I can manage? I don't think anyone could handle this. It's Christmas season, the restaurant is picking up, the festival... And you need to go see that man again before he leaves. As far as your painting goes, well, when this is all over, I'm sure you can fit it in. Yeah, yeah, maybe I can. Okay. Now, I want to taste that risotto. Oh... Yeah, not this one 'cause it burned while we were talking. Oh, okay, okay, okay. [nervous laughter] [Charlotte sighs] Okay, I'm just going to go. [joyous Christmas music playing] Hi. I'm glad you're here. I'm so sorry I missed the show. We had a later-than-usual lunch service. - I like it. - [Wyatt] Yep. - I saved the last bit just for you. - Me? Mm-hmm. You showed me brush technique. The least I can do is show you a little pencil technique. Okay, what am I doing exactly? Well, Santa wouldn't be complete without his belt. All you have to do is darken the lines. It's great. Just close your eyes and feel it. Nice. I have to admit, using a pencil is different than a paintbrush. Feels great to draw again. Um... Can I... Can I ask you a favor? Sure. I've been putting together samples for my submission piece and was hoping you could look at them. I could really use an honest opinion. I'd love to. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Th-That's great. - Well, let's go do that. - Okay. [perky Christmas music playing] Whoa! This is my workspace while I'm here. Oh, hey. I thought I saw you come in. - You must be David? - Yes. - I'm Charlotte. - Nice to meet you... You're the chef from Charlie's Kitchen. I am. I love your grilled shrimp. It is the best. - Well, thanks. - Yeah, and thank you, by the way. I hear that you're the reason that this guy has gotten into drawing again. I just suggested it. He did the rest. Well, I got to head to the store, so it was very nice meeting you. See you later, buddy. [Charlotte giggles] He's probably my oldest friend. Keeps me grounded. Just moved here, actually. Well, he'll be here awhile then. People who move here don't leave. Good to know. [cheery Christmas music playing] I just started drawing things that sparked my interest. What do they have in common? Honestly, I don't know. Well, you said you travel a lot for work, so maybe your submission could be about places you visited? I don't really get to explore much while I'm working. As soon as I'm finished, it's on to the next. My mom's favorite chair. She sat in that every Christmas while we opened up presents. I like it. This record player is cool. Oh. My mom, she was a singer with a great career. She traveled all over the country from gig to gig, even performed at Carnegie Hall. And that's where she met my father. He was in the orchestra there. So did you gain any of their musical abilities? Hm. I can clap my hands to most songs? [Charlotte laughs] You ever travel with them? Uh... No. Once I came around, they taught at a local college and that was it. Stopped touring. - Do you think they regretted it? - Yeah. I mean, I don't know. I would have. I love my career. I thought you said that you weren't satisfied? Yeah, maybe that was the wrong choice of word. It's more like I'm unfulfilled. You know, I'd rather be drawing by hand. Instead, I use a computer to create the architecture of choice for corporate headquarters or hotels. And they pay me. It beats having a real job. Like being a chef. You know, I didn't mean it that way. Um... Cooking is an art form, isn't it? Sure. It can be. For me, it's a job. Which is why you should be painting instead of cooking. Easy for you to say, world-traveling artist. I don't think I could do what you do. Nothing brings me peace like being at home, especially at Christmas. Yeah. I agree with that. - Which is why I'm here. - Mm-hmm. Spend Christmas with David and with new people. You know, um, I... I don't think these are all that random after all. I bet you have a story about how each of these was a part of your home growing up. Like the rocking chair? Has anyone ever told you you're very good at changing the subject? I have a Girl Scout patch in it. But look! Yeah, you might be right. Maybe I can do something with this. About the painting in the gallery. Yeah, it's... it's okay. You don't have to explain. Look, you're a talented artist and it wasn't my place to submit your work. It's your painting and if you want to take it down, you don't need my permission. I know. So? I'm taking it down. Hey, Charlotte. Is everything okay? Uh... I need to talk to you. Yeah, of course. So, the anonymous painting? It's mine and I decided to take it down. Wyatt knows about it. It's yours? [Charlotte] Mm-hmm. Charlotte, I love it. That painting stands a good chance of winning the competition. Are you sure you want to do this? Yes, I'm sure. All right. All right, well, if you change your mind, you'll just have to resubmit it with a new application. But using my own name, right? Good point. Submissions close on the day of the awards ceremony, the 23rd. Charlotte. I hope you submit something. You have real talent. [contemplative music playing] Nope. - [David] Hello! - Hey. Hey. So, uh... how's it coming? - [sighs] I'm still working on it. - Mm. Uh... You left this inside on the table. You missed a call... from London. Thanks. So you and Charlotte? Yeah, I asked her to give me input on my festival submission. Sure. No, really. Charlotte has an inspired approach to art. Please tell me there's something else to this other than "an inspired approach to art." - Of course there is. - Okay. She's fun, and she's different, and she's smart. She might even understand my dreams better than I do. I just don't know how I can make that work. Try this: take her on a real date. Spend Christmas with her. Don't prejudge. Just realize you have a lot of time to think about this. My constant travel doesn't really leave room for meaningful relationships. You know it killed my last one. I do. But people approach things differently and will change for the right person. My job isn't going to change. Just be open to it, okay? The call? Oh, yeah. London. Yes, I understand, but I'm not in a position to give you an answer right now. Let me get back to you. Thank you for the offer. - Whoa. - What's the scoop? The Hotel Magnifique could use my services. They want to commission drawings for all of their hotels. All of them. That's at least a six-month to a year job in London. - Big money? - Yeah. Wow. What are you going to do? They want to fly me down right after Christmas. What? One thing's for sure... their timing stinks. [sighs] [spirited Christmas music playing] Charlotte. What... What are you doing here? Were you up all night? You took it down. Yeah, I saw something in it. I didn't intend to finish it. I just wanted to do that one thing. I just... I couldn't stop. It's not done yet. Your mom sent me to wake you up. - She did? - She wanted to let you sleep. Well, I did all the prep work. - I must've slept past my alarm. - It's okay. - I'm so, so, so sorry. - Oh, no, it's okay! Oh, so glad you're back. We're starting to get busy. We're on it. I will take the crab cakes. Okay, I will take that. Honey, that's sugar. Are you trying something new? Oh, no. I just grabbed the wrong... It doesn't matter. Uh, Charlotte, why don't we take five? Ella, kitchen's yours. Okay? - I'm sorry I was late. - Figured I'd let you sleep. I was in the studio painting. I just felt so inspired. I really needed it. Is this about Wyatt? Maybe. Yes, um, but it's also about me. I'm just not ready to talk about it yet. Okay, well... you know I'm here if you need me. Thanks, Mom. I'm ready to get back to cooking. Okay. Is everything all right? I wish I knew. Tried giving her support, space, room to breathe. And look at her. She's more lost than ever. Believe me, she's far from lost. I think she's finding her way. Really? I sure hope so. Trust me. All Charlotte wants to do is make you proud. [Patrick] Welcome. Welcome to the annual Christmas Art Festival Showcase. [cheering and applause] Now, this year, our chosen artists are going to be decorating trees. So, watch as they create Christmas magic before your very eyes. Let the festivities begin! You really outdid yourself this year, Patrick. The gallery looks fabulous. And I love the tree decorating. Well, thank you. And people are really talking about the food too. And business is up, thanks to you and my daughter. Speaking of Charlotte, I have an idea I'd like to run by you. [peaceful Christmas music playing] Looking to decorate that tree too? - Can you do it by computer? - Stop that. Yeah, I'm looking at all the art on the walls and some of this work is seriously impressive, but nothing from my favorite artist yet. Doesn't mean I'm not working on it. Because of you, I am finishing my painting. - That's great. - Mm-hmm. I, on the other hand, am still unsure of what I want to draw. Okay, I'm finding that very hard to believe. Can't a guy fish for more help from his favorite artist? I'd be grateful for any ideas. In that case, I know just the place to help you get fresh ideas and shake you out of that funk. Meet me after I'm done here? - Can't say no to that. - Perfect. Well then. [laughter, indistinct chatter] [Charlotte] You should check out the ornaments. - [Wyatt] Are they all personal? - They are. [Charlotte] Every person writes down something they're grateful for every year. Reminds us that we're not going through life alone, you know? And it's also tradition for couples to put up a joint ornament each year. And have you ever put up an ornament with anybody? I have. His name was Jeff. I won't be putting up another ornament with him. What happened? We both grew up together here, and he couldn't wait to get out, and I needed to be here. He finally left a few Christmases ago. You've never wanted to leave? My mom needs me right now. Well, I'd love to see what ornament you put up this year. You think you can find it? - I think so. - All right. [laughs] Let's take a look. Warmer. Cold. Cold. Freezing, freezing, freezing. [laughs] Oh. - "Flavor"? - Yeah, flavor. Seasoning. I'm grateful for everything in my life. For the flavor everyone brings to it. Well, if it means anything, you've already added flavor to my life. Goes both ways. So, do they let visitors participate? - Any unclaimed ornament can be yours. - Okay. You okay? Yeah. I'm great. Okay. "Christmas in Bayside"? It brought me here to see my friend David and gave me something personal, and I'm grateful. So my plan coming here worked? Better than you could ever know. You want to share? Hmm... Not yet. And I'm grateful that Christmas in Bayside introduced me to you. You know, there's this awesome hot chocolate stand. Lead the way. [Charlotte] Wyatt, you in there? - I did it. - Hey, someone had their morning coffee. I finished my painting. It's amazing. I couldn't wait for you to see it. Can I see yours? Um... Not... not yet. I'm going to be late to the restaurant, but I couldn't wait for you to see it. - I love it. - I'll see you later? - Yeah, sure. - Okay. Yay! [laughing] Oh, good that you're here. We were just discussing how to freshen up events, and I thought with such fabulous chefs on my team, why not make tomorrow's open day a Christmas Cookie Decorating event? Show families that art can be tasty too. I like it, but I wanted to talk to you first. Well, as long as we have a day to prepare, I'd love to. We could host it here between lunch and dinner when we're closed? That'd be okay with you? Like you don't want to make cookies. I already have ideas. That's great! I'll fire up the publicity machine and fill this place up. I volunteer to get the ingredients. I know exactly how to do this. - I'll go with you. - Okay! Have fun! Thank you for being so accommodating. I know. It'll be fun. I love Christmas cookies and this would be really good for the restaurant. You could invite Wyatt. You read my mind. [both giggling] Ella did most of the prep on the cookies. She was really, really in her element. - Should be fun. - Then I'll be there. I wouldn't miss cookie instruction for anything. Did you get any work done today? I did, and, you know, I'm feeling very inspired. Good. Well, we have a full day tomorrow and I need my beauty rest, so... - No, you don't. - Stop. [both laugh] I wouldn't think of it. [lively Christmas music playing] - Wow. Nice crowd. You ready? - Mm-hmm. [sighs] I'm doing it with Ella. I wouldn't dream of doing it without her. Plus, she knows more about this than I do. I don't even know where to begin. Maybe you could start by not wearing the ingredients. Oh, my God. Thank you. It's time to get started. You got this. Thank you all for being here. Such a turnout. Look at all of these beautiful families! Today, we are going to be decorating Christmas cookies with Bayside's very own Chef Charlotte Williams! [cheering and applause] Hi! I'll be joined by dessert chef extraordinaire, Chef Ella. Now, every table has fresh baked cookies courtesy of Ella, as well as different frosting colors and candies to suit your artistic vision. So, let's all start with our Christmas tree cookie. Do you guys all have one? While there's no wrong way to frost a cookie, there are a few techniques to create something special. So, let's learn how to feather the frosting to create pine needles. [relaxing Christmas music playing] [indistinct chatter] What's wrong? The event is running long and we still have dinner service. I told them that I would be the bad guy and clear everyone out. I don't want to cost you money. We have a roomful of potential customers. Let's see if they want to stay for dinner service. - That's genius. - [Molly] Half price! Let's do it! All right. The fine folks here at Charlie's Kitchen have asked if you'd all like to stay for half-price dinner. What do you say? Anyone interested? I'll get the oven prepped and sauces started for dinner service. - I'll get the rest. - I got the menus. And I will, uh, start setting tables. Your wait staff just saw the crowd. They look pretty happy. Great. I don't think we've been officially introduced. I'm Molly, Charlotte's mom. I'm Wyatt, and I see where she gets her good looks. - You can keep this one. - [Wyatt chuckles] - So, anything I can do to help? - Do you know how to wash dishes? Our dishwasher just called in sick. Bring it on. [peaceful Christmas music playing] [sighs, chuckles] [Molly] I love a full house. That felt great. Better get used to it. This place is going to be packed again for the Gala tomorrow night. I think we can handle it. I'm excited. Our chance for some real press. So, how about a quick coffee before we call it a night? Hmm? - I think we all earned it. - I'll help you? Great night. But I still have a lot of work to do when I get back to David's. - I thought you were on a roll? - I am. I just want it to be perfect. Hey, you two. I forgot to say I'd love an extra shot of espresso with mine. I'll go see if anyone else wants something special in theirs. [clears throat] I like him. Me too. - Well, I'd like to talk to you about him. - I'm sure you would. Okay, fine. I get it. New subject. You still pulling all-nighters on your painting? No, I actually finished it last night, but I'm not submitting it. - What? - Yeah. I found something better to do with it. I'm going to give it to Wyatt for Christmas. Now, let's get these coffees out there, right? Come on. I got it. [peaceful Christmas music playing] Ella, Charlotte, get some rest. We have a big day tomorrow. - Wyatt, I hope we'll see you there? - I wouldn't miss it. We're going to take a walk. Good night. You went above and beyond for me and my family tonight. All I did was washing dishes. You and Ella did all the heavy lifting. So, did you decide what you're gonna draw? I think you're going to like it. That's all you're going to say? You're going to make me pry it out of you? What is it? Well, I can tell you it's better than I could have ever hoped. - Okay. - You added what was missing. Really? What? Flavor. That special inspiration only you could bring. - Wow... - [chuckles] And? And what? What is it? What are you drawing? Okay, I get it. You're not talking. Charlotte, I want you to know I've been happier this past week than I've been in a very long time. Me too. [exhales sharply] Okay, I need the right red. The right red. Christmas red. You talk to yourself a lot when you paint? What are you doing here? Gabe suggested I come talk to you. Why? He got tired of me telling him how worried I was about you. He has a point. I've been trying to set you up with guys since Jeff, and I'm worried you've fallen for someone who's gonna leave. And, you know, he is leaving. I mean, it has occurred to me. - But! - But what? But I think we actually have something here, and I want to believe that he would actually want to stay. Honey! He got me painting like I did when I first discovered it. He did this! This is more than my happy place. It's... it's where I belong. - I've known that for quite some time. - You could have told me. [chuckles] Is there really more than one color red? So what I'm looking for is Rosso Corsa red? A bright, beautiful, brilliant Christmas red. It's a funny name. - Italian sports car red. - Oh, pardon me. - I have a tube here somewhere. - I'll help you find it. Wait. I don't want to keep you, we have to prep for the Gala in the morning. We do, but first we need to find your red. - What's it called again? - [Charlotte giggles] - [brushes rattling] - Uh... Nope. [peaceful Christmas music playing] Hey, buddy. I'm heading to bed. Can I get you anything? Nah, you've done more than enough. You know, I'm watching your work, and it just reminds me of the loft in New York. [chuckles] Crazy Wyatt working until the middle of the night. You know, I feel like Crazy Wyatt. Yeah, well, women can do that to you. Yeah, she is the nicest person I've ever met. - Mm. - And I've been a lot of places. I guess it would be safe to say that you found your muse? I think more. Whoa. Oh, wow. [Wyatt] Not bad, huh? - Great work, buddy. Great work. - [chuckles] [sighs] [pan rattles] What are you doing? Making your butternut squash risotto. I added a few extras of my own. I never did finish a good version of this. I just kept getting distracted and messing it up. Well, your heart wasn't in it, but I love the idea, plus it turned out amazing. Here, try. Mm! This is incredible. We need to serve this tonight. With an herb chicken breast. We making progress? We were discussing what to serve tonight at the Gala. And? Ella's butternut squash risotto with herb chicken is Christmas on a plate. - Ella's? - Really? Really. This is your happy place. Well, it's your call. You're the head chef. I will get back to decorating so you can cook. You have no idea what this means to me. Trust me. I absolutely do. Thank you. You concentrate, you get the perfect delicious chicken. - Been cooking chicken since I was ten. - You've been painting since you were nine. - You need to tell your mother. - I know. - You can't tell them apart. - That's the point. I learned from the best. You are a terrific cook. Sometimes the student surpasses the teacher. [Ella chuckles] [exhales sharply] [David] Uh-oh. Trouble? Email from my friend in London. Double the money of the original offer and first-class tickets to London the day after Christmas. Whoa. Well, you're going to have to answer them. Yeah, I know. [exhales sharply] [jolly Christmas music playing] [indistinct chatter] I can't believe it, there is not a sour face in the room. At this rate, we are guaranteed to be in every article and blog. Do you think they'll want my photo? Do I look okay? You look beautiful. And if they don't want your picture, I do. We just might have pulled it off. There's not one plate with a single grain of rice left on it. All thanks to you. You made the right call. Thanks. Sorry to interrupt. I'll go check in with your mom and see if there's anything else. [Charlotte giggles] I know I'm probably not supposed to be back here now, but I need to talk to you. No, I'm glad you are. There are dishes to wash. Absolutely. Grab me an apron. I'm kidding. We have help, but I love that you were so ready to go. Unfortunately, that's why I'm here. I have a job in London after Christmas, and I wanted to be completely transparent with you. I also wanted to ask if you would wanna... No, no, it's fine. It's... it's fine. Like... it's not that I wasn't expecting this. I mean, it's just a bit more abrupt and direct than I was expecting. But you're you. You're... you're great. You're in demand. Um... I'll be fine. I... I'm fine. - Uh... Are you staying for the contest? - Charlotte! - They want a photo of all three of us. - Not right now. You made a huge difference in my life. Thank you for that. What did you do? [contemplative music playing] Charlotte, wait. Look, I wasn't trying to hurt you. You didn't let me tell you the rest of my news. Look, you have a "vagabond" life. I have a "find a place you love and stay" kind of life. - Oil and water. - It doesn't have to be. Yeah, it does. You know, for a moment there, I had dreams of you staying, working from here. I shouldn't have. I knew better. But you did teach me something that I'm so grateful for. What was that? That my art is something special. It is. And I intend to keep pursuing it. That's what I was trying to tell you. You can come with me. To London? I'm hoping you'll say yes. This could be your chance to start fresh as an artist without anything holding you back. Wyatt, this is my home. But you're stuck here doing something with your life you don't love. No, I'm not. Being a chef isn't my life. You helped me understand that. I'm an artist. That's what I am. But I can't go with you. And if this London job is your dream that you need to follow, I don't get in the way of dreams. I know how important they are. - Charlotte, just... - Goodbye, Wyatt. [contemplative music playing] I wasn't expecting to see you here today, you know, after last night. I wanted to talk to you, but your door was closed. I appreciate that. That's my favorite. But there are quite a few others in that studio of yours that are really quite beautiful. Really? You noticed? Of course I noticed. You're my daughter. I love everything you do. I always thought you considered them a hobby. I did, and I am so sorry. I have something I want to show you. You leaving? I am. I took the London job. Just called and got an earlier flight. What? Whoa, hang on. Whoa. You're leaving before Christmas? What about Charlotte? What about the contest? The contest? I started off doing it for me, I ended up doing it for her and... now she's gone. Gone? Wait, hold... What happened? I told her about London. When... when you got here, you were complaining to me about how you felt like your art had become this computer-generated business. You weren't happy artistically. Okay? But I've watched you since you got here. When you were making this, you were smiling. Heck! Even when you weren't working on this, you were smiling. Do you know why that is? No, I'll tell you why. It's not because of the art. It's because of her. - You know, I asked her to come with me. - Great. She said no. And did she tell you why she said no? This is her home. This is where she wants to be. Sometimes we just need to learn to get out of our own way, Wyatt. Just hold on to the things that make you happy. Okay? Everything else is just going to fall into place. I tried. Thank you for everything, man. - Of course. - It's really good to see you again. Come here. Now... I better go before... I don't know. One more thing. Make sure she gets this. See you. Hey, wait! What am I supposed to... do with this? Wait, did you... Is this the unfinished painting that everyone's talking about? This is the one I threw in the trash. And I'm really glad I did. It is spectacular. You really are a special talent. I can't enter this one. I won't. I'm going to give it to Wyatt for Christmas. So I painted a different one. It's called Christmas at Charlie's. Honey, it is magnificent. Mom. I can't be both a painter and a head chef. Believe me, I have tried. I am sorry if the pressures of running the restaurant made you feel like you weren't allowed to follow your dreams. I don't regret one second of it. It's our family's legacy. The restaurant will be fine, and I will be fine. What I need most is for my daughter to do what she loves. Now, I hope you're entering this one. I most certainly am. And I really want you to be at the awards ceremony. I need your support. Okay, I'm going to go clear my head. I'm going to go to the Christmas tree and add another ornament. Oh, I'm sorry about Wyatt. It's sad, but I'm a better person now that I knew him. And I like that. Charlotte! David, hi! You're putting up an ornament, nice. No. Um... no, no. Uh... Wyatt left this at my place. I brought it to show you. You know, he is more than grateful for you. I mean, the drawing he did for the contest, you need to see it. Where is it? He left it at my place. You know, I thought I had it all figured out before he got here. But I quit my job and I'm dedicating my life to painting. He gave that to me. That's incredible. Can I... Can I show you what you gave to him? Well, what are we waiting on? - Great. - [gasps] Hold on. [peaceful music playing] He's not going to, like, jump out or anything, is he? No. No, he's gone. Gone, like gone? I thought he was going to at least stay to enter the contest. No. No, he left. But... not entirely. He wanted you to have it. I had no idea. David, I... I can't accept this. Why not? Because every time I look at it, I just... will be reminded that he's gone. You know, he said you were his muse. Thank you. I'm glad I got to see it. Thanks again. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, Charlotte. Just the person I'm looking for. Hi. I just wanted to make sure everything was back in order after the Gala last night. Ella, what would I do without you? What would I do without all of this? You have been a rock since you first got here, and I think it's time you get the credit you deserve. Charlotte has decided to pursue her painting, and I am in the market for a new head chef. You are just what this restaurant needs. The job is yours if you want it. Yes! Yes, yes! I just... That was a position you wanted to keep in the family. You don't think you're family? Are you kidding? Now get your coat. You and I have an awards ceremony to get ready for on Charlotte's request. What about dinner service prep? Oh, you have staff for that now. They know what to do. We'll be back before the first diner. - Oooh! - [gasps] - [laughing] - Thank you! [lively music playing] [patrons chatting indistinctly] I'm glad you changed your mind. It's beautiful. I called London back. Turned down the job. You did? I sure did. - I love it. It's amazing. - It's the reason I couldn't leave. The reason I drew it. I can't stop thinking about you. I can't stop thinking about you either. And this. This right here. This is your heart on a canvas. You're meant to do this. So are you. [Christmas jazz playing] [patrons chatting indistinctly] - Charlotte and Wyatt? I thought... - [Patrick] Is something wrong? Apparently not. I have so many questions, but I know better than to ask right now. I'm gonna go look at some art. You know, I've been doing some thinking, and I believe that it would greatly benefit all parties involved if Charlie's Kitchen were to become the festival's official food supplier from now on. We'd have to work very closely on it, of course. [scoffs] Well, I happen to know the owner of the restaurant, and maybe you would like to join her for dinner there sometime. I would like that very much. [Molly laughs] It was my family's dream to make Charlie's Kitchen the heart of the community, to make it feel like home for anyone who stepped inside. Whatever I do in my life, wherever I go, Charlie's Kitchen will always hold a special place in my heart. They didn't ask anything because they know you're the winner. We'll see. How many finished paintings do you have not hanging in the restaurant? Hmm. That I'd want seen? Maybe over a dozen? Then you have enough to have your own showing. Would that make you happy? I know the owner here. That would be a dream come true. But what about you? We could show our art together. Well... you're my dream come true. But I'd love that. The results are in. [tense music playing] All right, before I announce the winner, I just want to acknowledge all of the incredible talents over at Charlie's Kitchen who've stepped up for us this entire Christmas week. Let's give them a big round of applause. And now, without further ado, the winner of this year's Christmas art competition is... With a remarkable personal piece, the award goes to... Charlotte Williams! - [Ella shrieks] - [crowd cheering] [whooping] [applause fades] [Patrick] There. [chuckles] [applause resumes] [patrons] Yay! I thought for sure you were gonna win. I didn't enter the drawing. Too personal. Besides, it's yours, not mine, to enter. I don't know what to say. I do. [chuckles] Thank you for all the flavor you add to my life. - Okay, you win. - [chuckles] Oh, I know. I have you. Merry Christmas, Charlotte. Merry Christmas, Wyatt. [sweeping symphonic music playing] [patrons cheering] [joyous Christmas music playing]
