All right, everybody shut up now! Listen up! You are in the presence of General J.W. Quantrell of the United Regime. [military drum roll] The settlement of New Hope is now under the jurisdiction of the United Regime. All oil malt refining will continue under the supervision of the regime. New Hope is no longer a town. It is a military post and will be run as such. One more thing, you are no longer the mayor. Now get out. All right, people, break it up, go home, and go to bed. Got a helluva day tomorrow. So get the fuck to sleep. Come on, boys. Let's lock this town up tight. MAN: Move it. Move it, you goat lickers. Get your asses to bed. I'm pulling out tonight.

[clapping] Come on, fat girl. Goddamn it, you know you drop a few pounds, you might be worth a shit to me out here. Huh? Maybe if you quit yelling at her, she would be able to get some work-- Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh, if it ain't the sassy one. You know-- you know, [chuckles] a purdy pin cushion like you, uh, ought to be tending a man 'stead of chucking these goddamn tires, hmm? Every think about that?

[chuckles] (SHOUTING) Come on, fat girl, goddamn it! [chuckles] [inaudible] tire. Woo-hoo! Come on, you bitches, get back to work. [woman yelling in fear] MAN: [inaudible] your ass. Stupid bitches, what the hell you thinking? I want the tire fuels empty and our gas hole is full by the end of the season. You don't have the manpower for that. I want yieldings, Mr. Ackett, high yieldings! Well, you're not gonna get 'em by killing off the farmers. Besides, Julie, you don't give a damn about yieldings. You just want to please your daddy. Well? We brought in four. That's all you found? I saw at least 20 fleeing town. [clanging] Home sweet home, tire suckers. Ran into a problem out there, sir. What kind of problem? Get the fuck in there. Hang him. He killed Freeman Zeke and [inaudible].. Well, how did he kill all three of them? [thud] It's obvious you're no tire farmer. Who are you, sir? Nobody special. [laughing] Well, what were you doing out in the dry lands, Mr. Nobody Special. Oh, I was just ambling, until your speed monkey showed up and started chasing me. What the fuck you sayin'? [spitting] Why were you running? Well, why were they chasing? To travel the dry lands alone, a man must be mighty confident. Or mighty stupid. Which is it? Well, sir, it would be stupid of me to say that I am confident I could kill any 60-year-old man before they draw a gun from a holster. However, (CHUCKLING) I can confidently say that I'm not stupid enough to say such a thing. So, uh, you tell me, am I stupid or am I confident? You don't seem to be taking us very seriously, sir. Well, I wonder if you even know who we are. Well, you're-- you're my captors. You joke in the face of death, sir. And you point a gun at it. I'd, uh, think twice about it, Julie. [click] [jagged breathing] [chuckling] May I see you for a moment? Julias? Why don't you settle this in the street? Your daddy would. [shouting and screaming] [bell ringing] [jeering and cheering] MAN: Yeah, woo-hoo! Let's go have some fun. Woo! Yeah, a lot of fun. Let him loose. [wind whistling] [inaudible]. [laughing] Let him have his weapons. [wind whistling] That's JW Quantrell's son. You can imagine what's gonna happen to you if you kill him. [giggling] [cackling] [wind whistling] Not yet! You want me to tell you when? [giggling] [gunfire] [wind whistling] Now, I ask you again, am I stupid, or am I confident? Shoot him. Hold your fire. I said shoot him! Hold your fire. [wind whistling] I want that drifter executed. I wouldn't be too quick to kill off a man with that skill. He humiliated me in front of my men. I want him killed. And I don't. Excuse me, gentlemen. It seems that you have an entirely wrong idea of me. Hell, I ain't looking for trouble, never was. Then what are you looking for? [wind whistling] I believe I have found what I'm looking for. [wind whistling] You wanna run with the pack, you gotta be one of the dogs. [sizzling] [wind whistling] [sizzle] You're not quite done yet. [sounds of fighting] [cheering] [laughter] Goddamn you pretty, but so what! [sounds of fighting] [cheering] [wind whistling] [howling] ANNOUNCER: Attention. Attention. Anyone caught wandering the camp after dark will be shot on sight. [chuckling] [wind whistling] Sweet dreams. BOY: Did you see that gun gypsy today? Showed that damn Death Rider a thing or two. MOTHER: Hey, watch your language, Luke. Did you see him? No, I did not. But I heard about him. Oh, should have seen him, Mom. He was one dirty badass. Oh, yeah? Do you know where he's at now? He's probably over in the liquor pit with the rest of the murdering devils, just waiting for someone to cross him so they'll have an excuse to kill him. But the stranger didn't kill him. He just danced his goddamn gun through the air like a bird. Hey. Hey. Hey. - Pow. Pow. Pow. You listen. Listen to me. It is by God's grace alone that we are still alive. And it's by God's grace only that we're going to survive this nightmare. Now, some gun-carrying man is no man to look up to, do you understand me? [wind whistling] Is everything all right? Hi, Dad. Grandpa, did you see that gun gypsy today? Fuckin-A right I did, boy. Goddamn he could shoot! Dad! Oh, sorry. Uh, Luke, don't cuss. Knock, knock, knock. Oh, keep your seat. Keep your seat, dad.

Son-of-a-bitch wins again! Get me a beer, bitch. Give me a beer, bitch. [laughs] Good to meet ya, Yuma. [crickets chirping] Our lives our in danger by just being here. If Sarah's not here by now, I don't think she's coming at all. We better get started without her. I say the decision is absolutely clear. Our only hope of surviving is-- is by complying. We are complying. We haven't lifted a finger against them, and they're still using us for target practice. I say we strike back. Vengeance is the Lord's, Miss Ada. His day of reckoning is near. Preacher, get out of your religious pipe dream and come back to reality. [drunken yelling] [chuckling] I'm goin' bet it all. Goin' bet it all. [laughing] All of it. Every last penny. Come on.

It's a nasty twist of fate when a man's shootin' at ya in the morning and reaping your money in poker that same night. What, you, uh-- you got something going on between my lady, hm? Huh?

Well, it's been nice playing with you boys. Me and my grand prize have got to go. I said you're cheating, mister. And you didn't takin' my whore nowhere. [laughter] Pshoo! [laughter] That's good.

You go home now. [crickets chirping] What? I said get out of sight before you get shot. [crickets chirping] [running] [crickets chirping] Shh, damn it. Keep your voices down. Sh! Sarah! Thank god. Are you all right? I'm OK. How do you get away? God's grace. [panting] What did I miss? Talk, Sarah, nothing but talk. But what are we talking about, Ada? Fight or submit. We have no weapons. They'll squash us if we stand up against them. That's right. They're squashing us right now. Ada, they killed my son. But they didn't kill me. I don't know if fighting is the answer. I don't know what the answer is. But I'm not going to stop until I find out. Wellman's right. We can't give up hope. We got to stick together. Hope for what, Sarah? God to come down on his mighty horse and save us all? You have no faith, sister. You have no balls, preacher. Just the hope that we don't fall apart. Let God's will be done! (WHISPERING) Look, preacher, I have faith, and I believe in the Lord. But there ain't no savior coming. It's just us and them. [raucous horn music] Why can't you just leave us alone? Get out of our town! [gunfire] MAN: Oh, that's it. Go on! Fuck off! Ah! [mariachi music playing] [laughs] Let's play some cards. [howling] [crickets chirping] [grunting] [sighs] You know they say that there are still astronauts up there. They're still floating around in their spaceships. [crickets chirping] I suppose they'll drift around up there forever. They ain't missin' nothin'. Maybe not. I was gonna get into space travel myself. But I join the army instead. [howling] Is that where you met, uh, Quantrell? Yeah. [sighing] Yeah, we were on an ocean transport when it got torpedoed, sank. And so we were underwater trapped when the boom hit. And that's what saved us. Then after a while, we-- we got out and made it to shore. And JW found an underground military munitions depot. [crickets chirping] There were roach-eaters everywhere, so we formed our own army. The old army was gone. But we weren't Deaths Riders then. We were survivors. [crickets chirping] [howling] When do you reckon, uh, Quantrell'll be headed back this way? Who knows. Maybe a couple of weeks. He's off somewhere "building an empire." What about yourself? What brings you here? Sir! Sir! [panting] Some people spotted outside of town. [belch] And they're not ours, sir. And And where are the others? They're drunk, sir.

You know what, Mr. Bacchas? You are really beginning to annoy me. [sizzle] Ah! Ahh! [sounds of pain] [fighting sounds] [screaming] [fighting sounds] [gunfire] Ooh. If I wanted him dead, I would have killed him myself. [wind whistling] What the hell happened to Charlie? Saw him a couple of hours ago, and he was fine. Where did you see him? Out in the tire fields. They were looking for that whore that Charlie was messin' with last night. - Where is she now? Back in the fields. Clemons, go get her. Somebody shot Charlie from behind! Somebody shot him in the back! Cowardly act indeed. What the hell is going on here? [wind whistling] We've been here a week. And already we've lost a dozen men. Mr. Ackett? I trust you will find out who killed these men. I trust you won't find anyone around here who's going to fess up to that. [inaudible]. And goddamn drifter took all our money in poker last night.

You're supposed to be in control of the situation! Where were you? Where was I? Where were you, Mr. Commanding Officer? Where were you? I am your superior officer. You will respect me. You're a pathetic little shit, Julias. Where are you going? [wind whistling] United Regime is the new way, Mr. Yuma. You are the old way. You are extinct. [chuckling] [gunshot] [car starting] You let him go! Why did you let him go? He's gonna catch up with Quantrell and then bring them all back here. And then he'll kill every one of us, once he sees what he did! We got no choice now. It's time to make a stand. I tell you it's suicide. It's suicide! - It's survival! - Now you all pay heed! God is coming back, and He's bringing his wrath with Him. Judgment Day is the only thing that's going to rectify us, nothing else. I'm telling you the end is near. And you all better be ready! The end? [wind whistling] I don't know where you been, Preacher, but the end's already come and gone. God done left you behind. Now, if you ask me, you people better learn to stand on your own feet. [wind whistling] Son of a bitch! [wind whistling] [snarling] [snarling] [FIGHTING AND SNARLING AND TEARING] [snap] [choking] [snarling] [snap] Damn roach-eaters.

[crickets chirping] Where's the boy's father? He's dead-- disease. He was the founder of New Hope. Built this town up from rubble. Was he the genius who figured out how to turn tires into a natural resource? Yes, he was. You invite a massacre to this town, Mr. Yuma. Well, that's all right. I'm a good host. [crickets chirping] This town was marked for death the day Quantrell rode in. [buzzing] Ah! What? God. Son-of-a-bitch shorted. Are you OK? [crickets chirping] LUKE: Here's your clothes, mister. [crickets chirping] [wind whistling] Ah. [clicking] [beep] [buzz] COMPUTER: Security code admittance level four. Sir! Where are you going? [baby crying] This is our home! You gotta stand up for it. Where are you gonna go, out there? There's nothing but death out there. [baby crying] If the sun doesn't get you, the roach-eaters will! [baby crying] We built this town from rubble. We gotta fight for it! A Preacher, please, if you stay, so will a lot of other people. I cannot lead my flock astray, Sarah. "Walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I shall fear no evil," remember saying that, Preacher? Where's your faith now, huh? Where's your faith now, Preacher? Sarah, give it up. They're leaving. Bunch of goddamned cowards, all of 'em! [wind whistling] What the fuck do you mean, one man? How could one man do all that? Christ was one man. So was Hitler.
