[MUSIC PLAYING] [SAW WHIRRING] [MUSIC PLAYING] MARTIN: Hi, honey. Hi. Rough day, huh? PATIENT: I don't want to lose this good thing that I've got, because if I do, I will surely, surely lose a lot. Because his love is better than any love I know. It's like thunder, lightning. Oh, the way he loves me, it's frightening. I better knock on wood, baby. Doesn't she ever shut up? Never. PATIENT: --about you, but I-- So can I go home now? I'll talk to somebody about getting you a private room or something. I don't like it here. Why can't I just go home? No. Why not? Because I can't afford the suits. PATIENT: Because your love is better than any love I-- I'm sorry about that. You are gonna have to stay here for a little while longer. Hello, Mrs. Jarett, time for these. Oh, Mr. Jarett, it's almost noon. Fine. I'm going. Thank you, dear. Listen, about the suits, it was just a thing. I'm fine now. You want anything? Magazine? Something like that? Are you going now? You're gonna be out of it in about five minutes. Want me to wait? Want me to stay? No. I'll wait. PATIENT: I better knock on wood baby. I better knock on wood. I better knock-- [MUSIC PLAYING] A new house? --lose a lot, because this love is better than any love I know. You're crazy. You're crazy. I'm telling you, you're mad. This woman is crazy, do you understand? She's mad! She's crazy! Doctors! Doctors? Doctors, this woman is-- is-- is insane. She is crazy. She's crazy, I'm telling you. She's nuts. [LAUGHS] She's crazy. The doctor said you're free to leave in a couple of days. WOMAN (VOICEOVER): You can't be serious. That the peace and quiet could do you good. I'm free? You're free. You're free, Alice. ALICE: I'm free? You're free, Alice. You're free. [CHAINSAW WHIRRING] [SCREAMS] There's no point in being inactive. Just don't overdo it either. Try to stay at home as much as possible. NURSE: Good luck, Alice. Relax. I am relaxed. Well, get more relaxed. [LAUGHS] OK. A house in the country is just what you need to get you firmly on your feet. I am on my feet. [LAUGHS] Well, get more on your feet. Oh, and don't forget, if you have trouble getting to sleep, take two of the tranquilizers. Or one, even, if your dreams are troubling you. I'm sure I'll be fine. I'm sure you will too. Oh, and I'm sure you'll take good care of her. I'm sure I will. And I don't want to see you back here again. You'd have to be crazy to come back to a place like this. [LAUGHS] [MUSIC PLAYING] BARRY: Mr. Jarett. It's beautiful. Honey. Honey. This is Barry Farnsworth. he's in charge of the renovations here. Hello. Pleasure. Pleasure. Well, what do you think of it? It's beautiful. It's huge. How are we going to pay for all this? MARTIN: I got a [INAUDIBLE] [MUSIC PLAYING] Don't worry. It'll warm up in a couple of weeks. Sorry, my wife-- - It's OK. I'm fine. I'm You just startled me. What? Fine. It's beautiful. Hell of a place. Hell of a place. It's big. Well, it needs a lot of work still. But still, one hell of a place. Practically had to sell my soul for it. It's done. Yeah, [INAUDIBLE]. Look, it's just like heaven. Morning. Hi. Hi. [BEES BUZZING] MAN: So we had a couple of joints and that was it. I left. MAN: So you didn't-- MAN: No, I didn't. I told you. The guy was there. She was there. We both felt stupid another time. Hey, guys, you want to give me a hand with the scaffolding? - You're an idiot. - OK. So I'm an idiot. So great. So give me a goddamn cigarette, idiot. Oh, jeez, sorry. I only got 11 left. Only 11. Nice guy. Nice dickhead. Come on, guys. Back to work, huh? We're on break, boss. Listen, you've been on a break for the last half hour. It doesn't look good. Come on. Hey, one more smoke, huh? Back to work. Come on. Get going. Now, now. Taking yours? What? Tranquilizers. No, I don't them. Helps you sleep, just like sleeping pills. It's so quiet here. I really don't think they're necessary. I can't seem to nod off without mine, especially when it's quiet. Why do you have so much trouble sleeping anyway? I'm a vampire. Night. [HAMMERING] [SAWING] Martin. Martin, do you hear that? [HAMMERING] [GRINDER] [HAMMERING] What are you doing? Just getting the job done, ma'am. Now? Do you have any idea what time it is? Well, a job ain't done until it's done. [GUNSHOT] Oh, it's a nail gun. You know, I'd rather use a hammer, but these things just rip the heck out of the rats. Well, I can see that. I best set some traps. That's probably a lot cleaner. I guess so. Um, look, this-- this work, do you have to do it now? Well, it ain't done. And it's-- yeah, it's gotta be done. Oh, OK. Sorry. Well, at least someone's working around here. Martin. Mm? I was thinking of doing some shopping, maybe buying some wallpaper. Let's get everything else finished first and then we'll talk about wallpaper later. What's your big hurry? Yeah, but I'd like to take a look around. And what if I see anything? Do you have any money? We'll have to talk about this some other time. [INAUDIBLE] Goodbye, honey. Have a nice day. [CAR STARTS] Hello? Hello? What the hell's going on around here, you guys? What are you talking about? Have you seen the basement? No. Well, I went down there last night before going home and there was nothing done. I go in this morning and it's almost finished. Get out of here. Yeah, it's true. Burns probably did it himself and then he forgot. Hey, fuck you. Look, basement walls don't dress themselves, all right? Well, then who did them. It's Gabs. It's Gabs for sure. Well, we could all use the overtime. It's students. He's got fucking students coming in at night. Students. Yeah, maybe. I don't know though. Hey, you got a smoke? Hmm? Do you have a cigarette? Hey, Burns, phone for you. I really can't say, Alice. Probably late. Well, you know these meetings can go on and on. As soon as I can. I promise. Yes. Fine. Hi. Hi. So looks like you're on your own tonight, huh? Yeah, I hate eating alone. Hate it. Of course, you know, we could have dinner together, huh? I don't think so. Ah, sure, have a little dinner, a couple of drinks, maybe have a bit of a [INAUDIBLE],, you know? So what do you say, huh? One aspect worthy of careful note is the pronounced masculinity factor in Paul Bunyan. As a matter of fact, it can be said that Paul embodies, in the extremes, of course, every masculinity trait that was valued at the time of his conception. Slide. Now, Paul was a woodcutter, an occupation, obviously, associated with robust masculinity. But he was also a giant. He was exaggerated, made immense. Slide, please. Now, the man's companion was-- was a big blue ox, a bull of sorts, a super animal with obvious male implication. But the threat of modern technological lifestyle to Paul Bunyan's brand of masculinity-- [BELL RINGING] All right. We'll pick it up next time. Do the readings. Don't forget, Michaelson, chapter 4 and 5. [MOANING] So there we were about to do it. And she says to me, so you have a rubber? So I look at her, and I say, no, aren't you OK? And so she says, if I don't got one, then we can't do it. So I think to myself, now, there's a girl with class. If I don't got it, then she won't do it. Now, that's class, if you ask me. You call that class? Yeah, that's what I just said. Guys, you want to talk about class, let's talk about that Jarett woman, OK. Now, there is a woman with class. Maybe a little too much class for you. You're very wrong, buddy. It just so happens I was supposed to go see her tonight. Her place, husband away. You're full of shit. You don't believe it? No, I don't. So what do I care? Anyways, that's what I'm doing. I don't know. I'm feeling-- I'm feeling kind of sensitive. You're going home. You're going to watch some TV. Look, guys, believe what you want, OK. That's what I'm doing. If you all excuse me, I'm a little bit busy tonight. Have a good time, Roman. Take it easy, sport. [LAUGHTER] [KNOCKING] Mrs. Jarett, uh, I'm sorry. What are you doing? I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I realize this is very unannounced. That just-- Can I come in? No. See, this is the thing, Mrs. Jarett. I just-- well, I just couldn't stand the thought of you all alone in this empty old house. My husband's home. I've come to keep you company. Would you please leave? How about a nightcap, huh? A little clever conversation. Get to know one another. Come on. What do you say? - Could you please leave? I think we got a lot in common. You read? Yeah, I don't much, but I like you. I like you a lot. So you like me? OK. Don't answer that. I've seen you. Would you please leave now? City life's pretty good, isn't it? Yeah. Busy, active, challenging. Country life isn't too bad either. Could you please go now. Of course, I'm not going to be here forever. Could you please leave? No. Work up a steak, and I'm gone. Kind of a city boy myself. Mind if I join you? Would you please go away? Great. Thanks. Look, why don't we just crack this open right now, huh? You know, Mrs. Jarett, I love wine. Love it. Don't know too much about it, you know? But I know what the hell I like. And I like you. I do. So let's just ease up, huh? [GASP] I do. [GRUNTING] No! Come on, honey, relax. No! No! [GRUNTING] [HAMMERING] What is that? Is that what I think it is? Huh? Fucking students. It's those goddamn fucking scab students. Well, we're just going to have a little chit-chat, huh? Yeah. Little chitty-chit-chat. And you know, you're just going to have to learn to keep your hands to yourself, aren't you, son? [SCREAM] [SAWING] Best get some rest. I'll manage things. What time did you get in last night? I don't know. 1:00, 1:30, I don't know. You were out of it. I guess so. You think you should be taking wine with your medication? I'm not taking medication. Really? Don't you think you should? You have a lot to say about what I should be doing, don't you? I think you should be taking some medication, before you go to bed, I mean. Could help you with your dreams. My dreams are just fine. Thank you. What are you looking for? I think this house needs a total cleaning, top to bottom, everything, floor, ceilings. Don't be ridiculous. That would take days. What's for breakfast? Yes? Any retail experience at all? No, but I'm very good with people. Good. What's your education? Do you have any chemistry? Paint is chemistry, you know that? Yes. Liberal arts mostly. Liberal arts. Mhm. Mm. You are aware that we deal in house paints, not art paints? You are aware of that? Well, yes. I'm about to paint my own house. Good. What about health problems? Anything that we should know? Well, I recently recovered from a nervous breakdown that had me in the hospital for several weeks. And sometimes I see things that can't really be happening. But I know that, so I don't think it's really anything that will interfere with my job. Fine. I think you'll do. When can you start? Excuse me, Mr. Jarett. Could I have a bit of a word with you? Yes, what is it? Oh, not much, not much, just a little labor problem, you see. It seems as though we lost our window man, Roland. He just disappeared. What do you mean disappeared? Can't be found is what I mean. You see, some of these guys here, you know, good guys, but they don't got the cleanest past. I don't think I want to know about this. Well, you know, every now and again, one of them is going to take off. But that's why we get them so cheap. That is absolutely fabulous, Farnsworth. What you're telling me is I'm going to have a beautiful house that won't have any windows. No, that's not what I'm saying. What I'm saying is there's going to be a delay. That's what I'm saying. Same price? Same price. So what you are telling me is that you can get rid of this guy, and yet, get the job done for the same price? Yes. Well-- Well, let's start by tightening things up around here, like those two. Get rid of them, Farnsworth. I don't want to see slackers here. Now, listen, those guys are just-- Farnsworth, I don't want to see them here anymore. Get rid of them. Do it. So how's your boss? He's OK. He's nervous. He's really nervous. It makes me nervous. What's he so nervous about? I don't know. I never know if he's mad about something, or if he's just nervous. Introduce me to him. Right now? Mhm. I'll make him happy. Angel. How's business, girls? Fine, Mr. Moore. Fine. Mr. Moore, I'd like you to meet my sister Rachel. Your sister. Well, hello, hello. How do you do? Didn't know you had a sister. Well, sisters are nice. Nice to have somebody to talk to. But talking sisters don't sell paint. And we're here to sell paint, aren't we, Alice? Yes, Mr. Moore. Mr. Moore, I'm an interior designer. And I work with one of the largest firms in the state. Here's my card. Perhaps you and I can do some business. What kind of contract are we talking about here? I'd say maybe 40 gallons a month. I hope you mean that, because jokes like that make me very nervous. So if you don't mean it, just say so. I mean it, Mr. Moore. I certainly do. Perhaps we can draw a contract up this week. So how's my little sister doing at the job? Very nicely, very, very nicely. Good head on this girl's shoulders. [GRINDER] [MUMBLING] Hi. Evening, ma'am. Nice night. Nice enough. You work pretty hard, don't you? Oh, well, hard work builds the world. Yeah, you work really hard. Don't you ever take a break? Not much. You lose your momentum that way. The thing about hard work is you can't lose your momentum. It's just like music. That's a nice thought. Well, that's just the way it is. You know, once you get it going, once you get the rhythm, it takes on a life of its own. And the moment you stop it. [CRUSH] You kill the rhythm. But you've got to stop sometime. Not until the job's done. Well, then, don't let me interfere. Oh, ma'am, you don't-- you don't break the rhythm at all. Matter of fact, you fit right in. I've got a job too now. Well, that's fine. I mean, that's real fine. Yeah, I understand that these days that's a lady's privilege. Hard work builds to work. Yes, ma'am. Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ. Hey, Farnsworth, what the hell is this? Listen, I'd-- I'd like to talk to you two guys. Come here for a sec. You guys. Yes, massa. Yes'm, we's coming. We's coming. - Shut up. - Come on. Loosen up. [HONKING] Say, I'm going to have to let you two guys go. Yeah, right. Well, it's not my choice, understand that. What the fuck are you talking about? Well, Jarett saw you horsing around the other day and-- So? Well, he doesn't want you on the site. Well, Jarett's an asshole. Well, maybe Jarett's an asshole, but, you know, my hands are tied. You're full of shit, Farnsworth. Hey, take it easy, you know. You should've kept your nose to the grindstone. You're fired. Yeah. Fuck it, right? Take the rest of the day paid. [ENGINE REVVING] [KNOCKING] Yes? Mrs. Jarett? Yes. John Johnston. Call me JJ. As acting sheriff for this community, I just want to welcome both you and your husband to the town Iron's Claim. Thank you very much. Would you like to come in? Well, I don't mind if I do. Thank you. Strong, or weak? Anyway is the right way. Beautiful house have here. Thank you. Yeah. Fascinating history in this house. How's that? Funny kind of story. First heard it when I was a kid. Well, what is it? Well, what had happened was there was a guy who bought a bit of land to build a house on, his house, a guy named Ed Vern. Yeah, Ed, was a carpenter by trade, small town, but good. Everyone pretty much agreed that Ed was a nice enough guy, expect he had a bit of a temper, a wild temper. [SMACK] So he had started taking out all these loans all over the place for material rentals, that kind of thing. And he gets to building his house. Wouldn't hire nobody to help him with it, or nothing. Wanted to do it all by himself. May I? Please do. Thank you. I love the sugar ones. Anyway, his house got to be a bit of an obsession with good old Ed. He'd work long, long hours. He wanted to make everything perfect. Excuse me. Oh, sure. Since he was only working on the house, he wasn't bringing in any other money. A year later, the house still wasn't finished. Of course, creditors came down and repossessed with the goods since it didn't look like Ed was going to pay up. Ed went a bit nuts about that. Couldn't deal with the place not being finished. And that temper he has-- [TICKING] So he killed a few repo men. Start killing them in the most disgusting, hideous ways you can imagine. Killed himself six or seven before we could nail him. You hear that? [DISTANT SCREAMING] It's the screams of repo men [INAUDIBLE].. Men ripped to peaces and killed without mercy. Men torn asunder. [DING] That'll be the tea. So what happened to him? Well, [INAUDIBLE],, never did get to finish the place properly. In fact, no one's finished the property till now. That's terrible. That's so sad. He sounds like such a nice man. Well, that's a funny way to look at a psychotic mass murderer. [LAUGHTER] Look, let's just forget it, huh? It's only a job. No, I'm not going to forget this. This is bullshit. They're going to pay for this. Split the whole fucking job. That would be great. They're not even Jarett's tools. They're Farnsworth's. Jarett couldn't care less. Well, Farnsworth got his head up his ass, all right? I mean, he could have stood up for us. Now they both deserve something. And I want those fools to get it. I'm not doing anything. Hey, come on. We can set ourselves up with all that hard work. We're going to business for ourselves. So you coming, or what? No. I'm not interested. But I'll bet you're coming, though. No. [GLASS SHATTERING] Shh. Shut up. Shh. Come here. Hold this. Shh, shh. Hey, look, if the window didn't wake them up, nothing will. Shh. Shut up. There's some more in the basement. We have enough. Look, I'll tell you when we've had enough. There's a brand new sander down there and I'm going to get it. Forget the sander. Let's go. Just wait. Hurry up, for Christ's sake. [SLASHING] [SCREAMING] Jesus Christ. You idiot. Come on. Let's go. [SCREAMING] You know, it's really not your fault. You've just been hanging around the wrong crowd. [DRILLING] You really should do something about that temper of yours, Ed. Mrs. Jarett. Call me Alice. Oh, good evening. Do you really think that's necessary? Oh, I don't like to leave things half done. I mean, If you're going to do it, you might as well do it right. It's a bit messy, don't you think? Oh, no. Don't worry about this. I'll fix it up. I love the job you did on the house. It's quality work. Well, thank you. You know, if you do something right, it stays right. Well, you certainly did something right. Yeah, that's the trouble these days. People do not take the time to do something right. I mean, they're always looking for the fastest way, or the cheapest way, and what you end up with then is shoddy workmanship and people living in little cardboard boxes. Well, people have different things on their minds. It's a modern world, Ed. Modern world? Aluminum siding, ma'am. I mean, there used to be a time when-- when a man took pride in what he did. Now all you got is a bunch of smart ass cop-- oh, I'm sorry. Pardon my language. Oh, that's quite all right. You see, nowadays you don't have craftsmen. People-- people are lazy, people are soft, people are scared to work. I mean, take a look at this guy, watch this, see. [DRILLING] You see what I mean? Soft. Everyone has their weaknesses, their soft spots. Have you had a chance to take a walk in the woods yet? No way. I haven't had time. Oh, it is so beautiful. We should do that sometime when I'm not so busy. Sounds like fun. I'd love to. - Yeah. Great. Anyway, I'll let you get back to your work. It's a pleasure talking with you, Alice. The pleasure's all mine, Ed. Goodnight. Goodnight. [SAWING] Things are starting to look pretty tight here. Glad to see it. I got rid of those two guys, if that's what you're talking about. I had to see it. Nice tight little team here. You know, with a tight little team like this, we should be able to polish things up a lot quicker, don't you? Save a buck or two. [TELEPHONE RINGING] Well, we're a little shorthanded. I wouldn't count on it. ALICE: Martin, telephone. Yeah. Yes? Oh, hi, there. Uh, no, no. Not at all. Yes, I'm fine. How are you? Mhm. Good. So well, what can I do for you? Mhm. Yes, that is a bit of a problem, isn't it? Yes. Mhm. Oh, uh, well-- well, yes, I understand. Mhm. Well, I probably do. Listen, we've discussed this before, you cannot call me here. Well, God knows I've already made enough concessions for you. You cannot call me here at any time. I've got a wife. Don't you think she wonders? Well, maybe you don't give a damn, but I do. All right? Well, yes. Well, of course. Yes. All right. OK. Bye, bye. Well, I'm here. 3:30 smack. Of course. I've got an alarm clock between my legs. Oh. Before you get too excited, there's something I want to talk to you about. Yeah, so talk. No, this is serious, Martin. Well, not too serious, I hope. I'm feeling a bit of the piss and vinegar right now. I'm pregnant, Martin. [SCREAMING] How long can you stay? Until Martin throws me out. Oh, God, you can stay longer than that. So all I might have to do is join the circuit, you know, ride the elephants. being shot out of a cannon, or walking the tightrope with everyone looking up my skirt. They hated that. God, they freaked out. Remember they grounded me for just wanting to shovel tiger shit. And now it's just Tupperware parties and wallpaper conventions. So have you thought about what kind of colors you want upstairs? What did they used to paint these houses, like a long time ago when they first built it? Sky blue was often considered-- I would stick to beige. I would stick to the somber colors. Maybe peach for the kitchen. I like that. Actually, I was thinking that a nice yellow for the kitchen might be more cheerful. Do you remember that guy, Nelson something, the guy that used to take his pants down near the school. - The school? - Right. Do you remember the day that he came with a garden hose on his neck? And he was running around telling everyone he was going to hang himself. And everyone said, please, Nelson, please do it, put yourself out of your misery. We were mean. We were sick to that man. Yeah. Girl talk, such music. Go to hell, Martin. I'm just kidding. I am kidding. I'm sorry. She's just kidding. I am. I'm just kidding. I'm sorry. I'm just kidding. What do you think you're doing? Having a barbecue. What does it look like? Do you have any idea what time it is? I'm not finished yet. And I really want to finish this. It's 4 o'clock in the morning, Alice. Job isn't done till it's done, Martin. But anyway, I'm not tired. Can I get you a glass of milk, or something? Thanks, Martin. That would be really sweet. Promise me one thing. What? Promise me that as soon as you feel a little tired you're going to come right up to bed. I will. Promise. I promise. Good. See you soon, then. Thank you. [DISTANT MUSIC PLAYING] Good evening, Alice. Hi, Ed. I was hoping you might bless me with a dance and maybe a glass of wine. I'd love to. Yeah. The music's lovely. Well, nowhere near as lovely as you. God, Alice, you-- you're such a woman. What do you mean? I mean that you're beautiful, and you're sensitive, you're bright, you're funny, and you know what's what. You do, you know what's what. What's what is you could do a whole lot better for yourself, better than him, you know? Don't you-- don't you want better than that? Things turn out a certain way and you stick with it. I don't know. I just don't think about it very much. Oh, no. Alice, you-- you gotta think about it. You gotta keep thinking about it. Listen, I'll tell you what, I'll give you something to think about. OK. You just think about us together right here in this house, just us. OK? Yeah? Wow. I'll tell you, Alice, we're going to close off the whole world. That might be a bit hard to do. Well, but it would be worth the effort, wouldn't it? I mean, nobody's getting between us and spoiling anything. No one. Just us, and the house, and the woods, and a love that would just grow with time. And a well. I'll dig you a well. With a bucket? I'll make you a bucket. Alice, you know what, there's always this. [SAWING] [SCREAMING] [GASPING] [CRYING] Morning. Good morning. Uh, Rachel. What? Nothing. You don't like me, do you? No, Martin, to tell you the truth, I don't. Yeah, I noticed that. I notice that a lot. Why not? Well, perhaps it's because you treat my sister like shit. Well, you and I could have been very happy together if you had played your cards right. I think he's having an affair. But, you know, I'm not surprised. So what are you going to do about it? Nothing. Doesn't really matter anyway, does it? Well, you've got to do something. It's not that simple. You see, there's somebody else. There is? Well, that's great. Who is it? Who? The carpenter. The carpenter? What do you mean, one of these kids that works on the house? It's not one of them. Well, who is he? Well, he-- he comes to see me at night, then he works, and we talk. He does things around the house. I don't know. He fixes-- he fixes things. And when I have problems, he takes care of them. I don't know. He makes me feel good. We were talking in a dream last night and he would make plans, and he makes me feel like a lady. I don't know. You'd really like him. He's-- he's real nice. That's good. We understand each other. I guess we're lost. That's really good. I'm glad. I'm happy for you. But you gotta do something about you and Martin. OK? This is serious. Something very real. Something real? Are you going home? No. So I'll see you in school? No. I'm not going that way. So I'll see you Thursday. Hmm? Same time? Mrs. Jarett? Yes. My name is Laura Bell. I'd like to have a talk with you, if I may. Right now? Yes. Come on in. Would you like some tea, or coffee, or something? I'm putting the kettle on. No, thanks. Unless you have some beer. [INAUDIBLE]. Have a seat. Funny thing about a day like today, the way the clouds are. First it's really sunny and then all of a sudden, bang, it starts to rain. Funny weather. Funny weather. Even funnier, though, is I'm pregnant with Martin's child. You think I'm stupid, don't you? You really think I'm stupid. You think I don't know that Martin screws the hell out of little kindergarten girls like you? I know. You want to hear something even funnier? I don't really care. Have Martin. Well, if you don't care, why don't you just give him up? Well, Before you come into my house then to drag your dirty little filth into my clean house, now that I care about. Your smart ass little filth into my clean house. So please, get out, cause it's not funny. You're crazy. Get out of my house. You're out of your fucking mind. Get out of my house. I'm here to tell you what's what. And you're just out of your goddamn mind. [INAUDIBLE] sleeps around. You're crazy. Who cares [INAUDIBLE] into this house. Stupid sack of shit. Get out! Hmm. Wait. [GUNSHOTS] You know, I'd rather use a hammer, but it just tears the hell out of the rats. Oh, shit. What is this? It's your girlfriend. You're crazy. You're fucking nuts. I've heard that before. In fact, I've heard it a lot before. It's not me that's crazy, Martin. It's you. Shut up, Alice. It's you that's crazy. It's you that's twisted. It's you that's sick. It's you that's a sick pervert. It's you that's a fornicating animal. Shut up, Alice. Kind of hard to fuck her now. [SMACK] Mister, that is a lady you're smacking around. [SCREAMING] Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Jesus Christ, you guys never shut up, do you? That's the trouble with guys like you, smart asses like you don't ever shut up, do you? You know what I mean, Alice? Smart asses like this just make me sick. Always have, always will. Oh, yeah, you've got your smart ass, perhaps you've got your smart ass theories. But you don't know the value of a hard day's work, do you? Smart asses like you, all you know is how to use your head, and not your hands. And you've got your big brain ideas, and your big brain smart asses, but, you know, if you had to use your hands, you wouldn't live a day, would you? And you know how to stop a hard working man with your smart ass accountants and your smart ass legal punk. Well, I've been putting up with smart asses like you all my life-- I've been-- [CRACKING] Ah, damn. Alice! Alice! Alice. Alice. What the hell happened? What happened? Answer me. What happened? Martin and Ed had a bit of a tussle. I think I've been fired. It's been a bad day. What? Ellie, you listen to me. This is serious. This is serious. You tell me what happened. It's just a bit of a mess. I guess there's going to be trouble, huh? We have to get out of here. No, no, no. There doesn't have to be no trouble. Unless, of course, somebody who has made trouble, right? And like you say, there's a bit of a mess, but hell, I'm the one who's gotta clean it up. Who in the fuck are you? Well, I'm just the carpenter. If you don't mind me saying, language like that does not sit well on a lady's tongue. Anyway, I'm sure a woman like yourself can see that a guy like that deserves what he gets from a guy like me. And if he gets it, bingo, he got it. What are you going to do, huh? Right? Right. You're absolutely right. You just stay here, OK? Because we're going to go. No, no, no. I'm sorry. I just can't do that. I tell you what, if you want to go, you go, but Alice and me, we got this-- we got a plan. We're going to go. You just stay back. We're not going to go now. OK. And I wish you'd quit repeating yourself to me. Not to me. I'll take the lady. Excuse us. Leave her alone. No! Rachel, no! Alice, I didn't have a choice. If she'd give me a choice, but she left me no choice. Get away from us. You're an asshole. You're just like Martin. You're an asshole. You're a pig. Stop that. Stop what, you asshole? Oh, Alice. Oh, Alice. Alice. It's not like that, Alice. I want something real special. I was pretty damn good. You know? Look at me. Look at me. What am I supposed to do, huh? What was I supposed to do? It's the house. It's the goddamn house. It's not the house. It's you! This is my house! [SCREAMING] Alice! Alice! No! No! Alice, stop it! Stop it! [INAUDIBLE] young lady. [SCREAMING] This is a tool, not a toy. You know, I really tried. I really tried to be reasonable. But enough's enough. Courting, done. Besides, you ain't married no more, are you? What else is there left to do, huh? Nothing. Don't do you think it's time you gave out? You're disgusting. You make me sick. You're filthy, and you're dead, and you smell bad. Come on, Alice, give it out. Look, I am sick and tired of your game. Now, you and I-- you and I, we got plans. Now, come on. Give it out. With me. Get away! Hey, Mr. Fix It. Not him, the house! [POUNDING] Alice! No! Alice, don't! Alice! [GRUNTING] Alice! Alice! [SCREAMING] Come back! Alice! Come back here! Alice! Hold on, Alice! Get back, damn it! Don't do this! It could have been us, Alice! Don't go! I love you, Alice! Don't go, please! Alice! Alice, don't do this. You should have been more of a gentleman, Ed. [MUSIC PLAYING]
