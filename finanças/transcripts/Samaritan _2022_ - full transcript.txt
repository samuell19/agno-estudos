Many years ago, a battle of good versus evil was waged between Samaritan and Nemesis. Twin brothers who became sworn enemies. But let me start at the beginning. They were freakishly strong. They unintentionally hurt people. The residents of the town grew to fear the brothers. They waited until the family slept, boarded up their home, and set it on fire. The parents were burned alive, but the twins were unscathed. Samaritan grew to fight for justice, to be a protector. Nemesis, consumed by revenge, wanted the world to suffer as his parents had. Samaritan tried to contain his brother's fury, so Nemesis forged a powerful weapon. A hammer that he poured all his hate and rage into. It was the only thing that could destroy Samaritan. Nemesis lured him to the power plant, where he would defeat his brother once and for all. Joey! What happened? Run, man! He's... It's Nemesis! Get the hell back! Nemesis knew his brother would come to save the innocent. The brothers were equally matched. With the hammer, Nemesis had the upper hand. But not for long. Samaritan and Nemesis died in the blast. This is the story we've all been told. But I believe Samaritan is still alive. In fairness to our caller, if Samaritan was in fact... - a type of guardian... - Which he is. ...why fake his death? Samaritan abandoned us. - Yes, but why? - That's bullcrap. That answer is in my book, Samaritan Lives. Sam? Sam, you got any cash on you? Ma, come on. What happened to the five bucks I lent you last week? I need it for the bus. Please, I'm gonna be late. I need it. And, you know, after taxes, it takes me about an hour of bedpan cleaning just to earn that five. Ma, just take it. Thank you. I love you. - I love you. - Oh. And don't forget, take out the trash. It's raining. It's smelling. Lock this door. Be good. Morning, Joe. Yeah. Wait up, wait up. Anything good? Maybe. Get a puzzle. Come on! This again. Damn it. Hey. What is that thing? - Radio. - That's cool. Does it work? Dead as a doornail. Why do you have a broken radio? Why're you wearing a broken watch? Shorty! Hey, yo, Sam! Come on, squirt. Heard your door got taped up. Think you might wanna help me, now? Why would I wanna help you out? You always call me squirt. What you want? An apology? You wanna make some money or not, little man? What'd I just say? - Shut up, Jace. - You got it, squirt. Where you going? Come on, stop being lame. You need the money, don't you? All right, then, come on. Whoa, man! Stop crying and get up there, man. Ain't nobody watching. Let's see, let's see. It's time to handle business. - I want you to start right there. - What? You heard what I said? Come on, man. - Come on. Start over there. - Okay. Right at the bottom. That match your height. Bro, don't look at me like that, bro. Come on. Come on. Put your back into it or something. Yeah. Come on. Pull it up, pull it up, pull it up. Loving it, loving it. Yeah. That's a lot of money right there. Come on, little man. You can go faster than that. Come on, man. Whoo-hoo! I feel like a birdie. I'm flying like an eagle. Hey, man, you might want to downplay this type of thing where we're going. What do you mean? Man, Cyrus loves Nemesis. Wanna be just like him. We're going to Cyrus' place? You didn't tell me we were going to Cyrus' place. That guy is out of his mind. All right. How much you want for it? $400. Divide that by 10. 40, 40. Nah, man, put a one in front of that 40. - Are you high? - Man. Throw it on the scale. The scale never lies. - 40. - Man, that don't even say 40. You tripping, bro. Hey, boss. Yo! What's up, shithead? What you doing? Selling candy for your basketball team? What's up? Nah, man, I'm selling wire. Ah. You coming up. How much they drag in, Pete? - Uh, $40. - $40! Y'all wanna make some real bread? There's a package store on Castle Road. I need someone to make a fool of themselves, cause a distraction. Hey, look, man, I ain't doing nothing for you. Punk bitch. - My boy Jace big, but he a pussy. - I'll do it. What? - Nah, come on, man. - This lil' kid here. What? I can do this. - Nah, man, you tripping, bro. - Yo, this kid is crazy, man. I just distract the guy? That's it. That's all you gotta do. Yeah, I'm in. Come on. You got a problem? No, there's no... What you looking at, old lady? You got a problem with my friend over there? Yeah, you got a problem? Come on, come on. All right. - You see him? Old guy? - Yeah. Stop looking. Stop looking. We're just taking the lotto tickets, right? All right. He's not gonna shoot you over that, probably. What do you mean, shoot? You know what to do. - Wait. No. - Come on. Pow. Help! Help, please! Help! A car... I don't need this shit. - A car ran the light. - What? Help! Please! Get the hell out of here. This is none of my business. I need your help. I can't get up. Come here. What the hell is that? Hot sauce! - Run, run! - Goddamn thieves! - Let's go. - Go, go, go! Goddamn sons of bitches. - Okay! - Let's go! - Open the box, open the box. - Yeah. Yes. There's some serious value in there, cuz. - And we can do that shit anytime. - Anytime, huh? What the hell's wrong with you? I told them to check inside the boxes, cuz, I... - You didn't look inside the boxes? - Hey, chips is good though. It was him. Cuz, it was him, man. - He took the wrong boxes. - That didn't happen. I did exactly what you said. Are you calling me a liar, bitch? Yeah, boy. Are you a liar, Reza? Nah, Cyrus. How old are you, pal? Thirteen. Youngest and the smallest, huh? Used to happen to me too. That gets old. Shit rolls downhill. That's what's happening here? Should be grateful. The little man knows when to keep his mouth shut. Cyrus, that's bullshit. Reza. He likes you. He likes people that got bite. I was scared as shit. But you didn't rat. That means something. Yo! Come on. Shit. Big fan, huh? Let me guess. You like him 'cause he was the good guy. Me... I got a different perspective. Nemesis hurt people. Sometimes. But it's not always if you hurt, but who you hurt. Nemesis always punched up. I was about your age when he died. He was my hero. Nemesis humbled the proud, gave people a beating who needed a beating. To people around here, Nemesis was a god. Samaritan, just another cop to protect the rich while the rest of us went hungry. For what you did today. For what you'll do for me in the future. You do this every month. And every month, I tell you I get my check on the 5th. Like, why do you do this? Why do you embarrass me like this? - Mom... - We got rules. - Has my check not been there before? - Mom. - Not on the first. - Mom! - Mom. - No. - Mom. - No. You enjoy doing this. I'm not running a shelter here. Take the damn money. Here. Open the goddamn door! It's not personal. Same shit every, every time. Can't open it fast enough, huh? Come on. The nerve of this guy locking me and my son out. As soon as I get enough money, I'm gonna quit this job, we're gonna get on a bus, and we're just gonna leave this city. You will never have to deal with that creep's face again. And go where? I haven't figured that out yet. What's that all over your face? I went to the store, and I slipped, and I broke a shelf, and I got sauce all over me and in my eye. And the guy at the counter gave me some money so I wouldn't tell anybody about it, okay? What have I always told you? Sam? What have I always told you? The decisions you make add up. Exactly. Where did you get that money from? Why didn't you ask me that before you took it? Even if I'm not very good at the job, I'm still your mother. Ma. Good. They're here. The guy who led us to 'em said they pack one hell of a punch. Where'd you get 'em? You know that army base they're closing down outside of town? We planted one of our guys to the burial ordnance. The things you bury tend to haunt you. Like a ghost. - Oh! - Boom! When are we gonna do this? Tomorrow. Tensions in the city continue to rise as the civil servants union enters its second month of strikes due to drastic budget cuts. Unemployment is on the rise and homelessness is at an all-time high after an unprecedented spike in evictions and foreclosures citywide. Many attribute our current fiscal crisis... Hey. Yo. Hey! You thought I was kidding? I want the money you cost me. Get him! Hey! Get back here! Go! Come on! Come on! Get him! Come on! Get him! Chris, grab him! Your mama's gonna hear you scream. My mom's at work. Oh, yeah? Well, she's gonna find you dead. Oh, my God! Oh, my God. What's your problem, man? Come on. Oh, my... Go on. Beat it. You need to make some new friends, okay? Let's get out of here. - Come on, bro! - Hey! - Let's go! - We know where you live, old man. Samaritan. Oh, my God. Nearly 17% of the workforce has become un or under employed. With the rise of autonomous manufacturing, that number is set to explode. Now the machines are taking jobs... Okay. "Smith, Joe." And it's not a matter of if, but when. And there needs to be a safety net... Joe. Joe. Joe Smith is Samaritan. Am I always gonna have to look out for you? "Am I always gonna have to look out for you?" Officer. Evidence room's closed. Come back some other time. Ever seen one of these before? Blackout bomb. Plays hell on electronics. Poof! Where's... What's that? Nemesis. It's here. I feel its power. With this, I can finish what Nemesis started. Yo! Wait, that thing is for real? Of course, it's real. You think he's messing around? Let's go! Oh, God. - I gotta talk to you. - No, you don't. - I found him. - No, you didn't. Hi, kitty. Seriously. I found him. Samaritan. Yeah, you told me months ago. The custodian at your school, right? No, not him. Turns out, he was just really strong for a janitor. Or the mailman who outran the bulldog, right? A breed known for quickness. That dog was so fast, you gotta see him run. Look, kid, I am a serious journalist. An intellectual. I know. I respect your work. Did you even buy my book? Of course, I bought your book. Okay. I watch you online. - Yeah. - No, but... I love your videos. I watch them all the time. Come on. Look, kid, you can't just come in here and harass me, and scare away all my customers every time you see an old man make a sudden movement. Get out. But this time is different, I'm telling you. Look. I got ten bucks. I'll buy one of your books, if you just hear me out. This is sweet. Twenty years of blood, sweat, and tears on these walls. Whoa. Hey, I actually... I have something I wanna show you. Now, you can't touch this. Do not touch. Just look. Ten years ago, I had a friend who was a custodian at the police impound. He took this photo. That is a special hand-forged hammer. It's a beauty. Do you know where it was found? No. They found it at the death site. Oh, wow. Bet that hammer was forged from the hatred that Nemesis had for his brother. And that that hammer is the only thing that could leave a scar on either twin. Now my theory is that Nemesis started the fire in that power station because he wanted to throw the whole city into anarchy and chaos. And, of course, he wanted to lure his brother into a trap. But that plan went haywire. Ultimately, it was his own hatred that destroyed him. Man. Okay, let's get to the main event. Who is your Samaritan this time? He's a garbage man. He lives in the apartment building across from me. That's convenient. Look, this time is really different. He beat up these kids that always bully me. He beats up children? No, no. Like, older kids. Like, gang kids. He has this big, nasty scar on his back. Exactly like he was in a fire. And how did you see this scar? I can see him in his window. Okay, I don't know what's more concerning here, that you think Samaritan lives across from you, or that you're peeking in the windows of old men. No, no, no. It's not like that at all. Look, kid, you've said your piece, that's ten dollars' worth. Okay, just wait one second, okay? Let me grab something. Let's go, grab your stuff. Look. He did this. Just by grabbing it. With his bare hands? How cool is that? How do you know the knife wasn't like this before the garbage man grabbed it? I saw him do it. Oh, kid. You're gonna need more than a horrifically scarred old man, and a bent knife, Tim. Sam. Close enough. Grab your stuff. I see you up there, a-hole. Whoa. What? "Samaritan saves the day." Samaritan. You understand what it makes me look like, when my cousin lies to Cyrus? It looks bad. I vouched for you. - Farshad, what do you want me to say? - Nothing. Just stop talking. Yo. That's him. That's that old man. That's the old man that beat you up? Tuna, you go try him. He'll beat your dumb ass, too. That's him. Sam? Sam. Come here. Sam! What, Ma? What are you doing? What do you mean, "What?" I thought we could have dinner. I... - What happened there? - That? I ran into a locker. A locker? Does that locker have a name? What? No. Just a locker. Yes? Your kid took something valuable of mine. What? Who are you? Joe Smith. I live over there. What did he take? My scrapbook. Sam. Get over here. You have something that belongs to this man? Let's have it. Apologize. I'm sorry. Is that all you have to say? I don't know. I'm a fan? What is wrong with you? What is that even supposed to mean? Wait. Could I ask you for a favor? He's a good kid. He really is. So please, don't call the police. He won't do this again, I promise. And this is not an excuse. His father... Look, he's changed. And you can blame me. It's just... He's good. He's just a little lost. No harm done. You have a good mother. Lucky. Very lucky. Oh, shit. I've already checked out that dumpster. Not much in it. You know, I wasn't gonna keep the album. I just thought you were him. That's all right. You know, I used to steal some stuff, too. But who did you think I was? Him? Yeah. Samaritan's dead. That's what they say. Yeah. I just pick up garbage for a living. That's what I do. Don't punch me in my face if I don't agree with you. I would never punch you. What? Why do you have that scrapbook? Because I'm a fan. Like you. That's it. So, why don't you go play football or whatever you do, because all this questioning is just starting to get on my nerves now. Calling me this person and calling me that. You mind your business, I'll mind mine. You're a liar! I don't believe you! Listen, kid... Oh, we got him. Oh, he's out. He's out. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Come on. Oh, my God. Oh, my... Are you okay? Fuck no. Holy shit! Oh, my God. Oh, my God! I knew you were him! I knew it! I knew it! Come on. I knew it was you this whole time. I need water. I knew it, everybody! - Hold it down. - Okay. - Water. - Okay. All right. Okay, go. Get lost. You're bad luck. No way. This is the best day ever. For you! Heaven! I can't believe I found Samaritan. Wrong. You're just a dude who gets hit by a car, gets his bones broken, and eats mad ice cream. I eat this stuff to cool my body down. Why don't you just drink some ice water? I don't like the taste. -Can I have some? No. undefined -undefined Sorry. I need it for emergencies. Why were you steaming? You know anything about binary fission, cellular thermodynamics? What? I'm 13 years old. You know what happens during a heat stroke? When I get hurt, my body overheats, and if I don't cool it down, my heart explodes. That is not human. Wait. Is this how it was for Nemesis? You guys were brothers, right? Enough with the Nemesis stuff. Why don't you go have some ice cream? Thanks. You saved my dad once. Where do you come up with this stuff? Have you ever looked up the word "delusional," because that's what you are. You're delusional. I'm not delusional. I'm serious. You saved my dad. He used to boost cars. You caught him one night. And instead of busting him, you talked to him. What'd he do, write fairytales for a living? No, he died. Let's see if we can wake these people up. My bad. There they go. We can do better than that. I swear, I'm gonna beat the crap out of you. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah! Bring it! Hey! Granite City... Who comes to help the helpless? Who is our hero? Is that Nemesis? I am back to start a revolution for all the people this city left behind. Our movement will put the power back in the hands of the people. It's time to take back what is yours! Put this on. Here you go, my man. The revolution starts now! Nemesis! Nemesis! Nemesis! Nemesis! Nemesis! Nemesis! Go! Go! City officials are in shock from last night's events. A mysterious blackout and gang of men in Nemesis masks triggered a long night of looting last night. Several people were injured. With the town on edge already with high unemployment and poverty on the rise, some say it's only a matter of time before the city implodes. Hey. What do I have to do? Throw you under a bus to make you stop following me? Samaritan wouldn't do that. What if he was having a bad day? Come on. So, what's in the bag? Hey, hey. It's a camera. Don't touch. - Where you taking it to? - To a pawn shop. Sounds horrible. What do you even do all day? Fix things and get depressed? I'm a troglodyte. - Do you know what that is? - No clue. It's Greek for a man who dwells in a cave. See, I'm a caveman. I live in a tiny apartment, and it's fine. I'm good with it. I like being alone. You know what bothers me? What really depresses me? Being around other people. Follow me? No. That doesn't make any sense. You save people. That's not a loner. Smells like bullshit to me. You got big balls. I'll give you that. So, how much do you think you're gonna get off the camera? I don't know. 10 bucks, 20 bucks? God, what are you, an accountant or something? Do me a favor, stay here while I go in there. Still want me to come in? No, yeah. That's why I said, "Wait here." Hey! What are you looking at? Sorry. What? You just let that happen? Should've thrown him over a tree or something. I'm disappointed. Stay out. What the hell did you do? Just snapped off. It's falling apart, like both of us. Yeah, well, speak for yourself. This is solid brass. I know. But even brass gets tired. I'm taking this out of your account. That's fair enough. Another Sunday, another piece of junk. - Give you $25. - Whoa. Really? Here we go again. It's not a Canon. How about $50 and I take your picture with it? Okay. Hey, come on! What are you doing? - Stop! Thief! - Look at this. See? This is what happens when you let a couple of genetic freaks try to fix your city. People gotta get rid of their own problems, or their problems gonna get rid of them, right? Right. How many bad guys did you fight at once? 100. Wow. How strong are you? I'm still pretty strong. You saw that. But not like I once was. Things start to fall apart when you stop caring, and I stopped caring a long time ago. How far can you jump? Then, maybe over 10 cars. Now, nine. No way. Let's see you do it. No, forget it. I'm not gonna wreck my knees entertaining you. Have you ever had to jump off a building? No, but I've thrown a lot of people off 'em. I'm just kidding. Man, I've told you too much. You can trust me. You should know that. You ever get scared? Why? Are you scared of something? - Just... - Sure, I get scared. Come on. Everybody does. Fear, that's natural. But you'd still fight. Yeah, when necessary. But I don't want to. I don't like it. When I get scared, the first thing I think about is running. And I always freeze up. Hey. Come here. That's the smart thing to do. Street fighting is for fools. Why would you wanna get into a fight with some stranger who has nothing to do with your life, who could take your life? What you're doing is right, okay? You better get going before your mother calls the cops. All right. Good night, Joe. Sam. Let me see your watch. I'll try. But no promises. Thanks, Joe. You're welcome. For the second consecutive week, rioters filled the streets of Granite City. Another spontaneous blackout followed, which some attribute to a man claiming to be the presumed dead villain, Nemesis. Under the cover of darkness, organized looters vandalized financial institutions wearing Nemesis masks. Is Nemesis back? That is what the city is asking this morning. Morning! What's so good about it? What's the matter? You sleep okay? I got a migraine. You'll get 'em when you get older. They're a nightmare. Well, funny you say that. I always have nightmares about you getting hit by that car. - And since I saved you and all... - Yeah, thank God for that. ...I was wondering, if you could teach me how to fight? -No.Please. undefined -undefined -Forget it. Come on. undefined -undefined I wanna learn. I wanna be like you. Please? Be like me. All right. Meet me on the roof after work, okay? Okay. Thanks. What a bad idea. Hey. Sorry I'm late. That's all right. -Come on. All right. undefined -undefined Let's see you move around little bit. See what you got. -All right. Come on. undefined -undefined I don't have a lot of patience. Chill out, old man. - Oh-ho. - Okay. All right. Look at speedy boy. Wow. Where'd you learn to rip like that? My father taught me when I was four. I quit when he died. - That's impressive. - Thanks. Hey. Hit my hand. No, no. Hit my hand. It's kind of hard to miss. - Why do I do that? - What? - Back up? - Yeah. Like a coward. - Why? - 'Cause you're lucky. I don't fight back. How am I lucky? You're lucky because you were raised right. What if you don't got a choice? Like, let's say if someone messes with your mom. Well, then you sucker punch the fool and run like hell. Is that fair, though? Hey, if life was fair, everyone would get along. But guess what? They don't. Crazy. -What? You. undefined -undefined Well... Really? That's what you get for sucker punching me. Come on. We'll get some ice. - Oh, my God! - What were you thinking? I don't know. You know I'm built like a tank. I think it's broken. Nah, it's not broken. Just bruised. This will fix it up. Here you go. Put your paw in here. Thanks. Why you like working on all this old junk so much? It's therapeutic. You see this old toaster? See? Breaking things comes easy. Now, fixing them, that helps me relax and focus, and I figure, some of these old things deserve a second chance. Like you? Nah, I'm just kidding. Whatever happened between you and Nemesis? You just don't quit, do you? Good thing Nemesis is gone. Maybe, but none of you know what really happened. All I know is that Nemesis died that night. Do it. Albert Casler says that Nemesis had a plan to blow up the power station. And throw the city into anarchy and chaos. He doesn't know what the hell he's talking about. Go home. Go on! Little man. What's going on, kid? Nothing much. Come to earn that $100? Yeah. Decided I wanna punch up. Get in. Sil. Let's go. Hey, kid. So, you got a family? Just my mom. It's more than I had. I never had shit. Not till Cyrus found me. Sleeping in a car out back when I was, like, eight years old. He woke me up. So, I bit him. You been with him ever since? He's my family. Same for all them. Cyrus gave us this. So, don't disappoint my family, Sam. I'll take everything from you. Ready? Yep. This is gonna be complicated, so pay attention. Right. If a cop comes, you whistle. That's it? Let me hear. No. What? Vicinity of 34th and 3rd, all units in the area. Do it like that, kid. Sorry. Hello, Officer. Here you go. You gotta learn how to whistle. Notice how a cop don't look like much without a badge and a gun. Why are you screwing with me? I paid you to look the other way. That power station, it controls the grid to this part of the country. Yeah. So what? You almost blew the whole plan. I wasn't gonna sit by and watch you assholes plant bombs. Okay, Super Cop. Sil. Okay, okay! I'll leave! I'll leave, please! Stop it! I can't hear you. It's very loud. I'll get out. You'll never hear from me again, I swear. I won't tell a soul. What? I'll leave! Just turn it off, please! Stop. Thank you. Leave and never come back. You'll never hear from me again. I promise. Thank you. Thank you. Welcome. Always give people hope. Help! Yo, stop! Come here, fat boy. I'll smack you. This turd owe me money. What? You gotta choose, either him or it's us. You either with us or you ain't. Come on. Sam! Help! Get a good grip. Hold him up. Jace! Get the hell out of here! Go! Go! - Hold him up! - Come here. Hold him up. Hold his arm out! Let me go! No! Hey! Hey! Cry for me. Do it. Burn it up! Yeah! Would you look at this shit? Come on, come on, come on. Doctor Davis, telephone, please. Doctor Davis, telephone, please. Hey, Sam. How you doing, buddy? What the hell happened with my son? Some kids beat him up. And you couldn't stop them? No. Some hero you are. Doctor Blair. Doctor Blair. When the bombs go off that we planted at the power station, the central grid goes, okay? That means - all of the power that comes in and out... - Hey! Hey! He's alive. - Who? - The old guy! Not a chance. Do you see that damn car? Cuz, I'm telling you, I saw the guy walking around like nothing hit him. - Man, we hit him solid. - Who? Some old man that was messing with Reza. And you popped him? Hundred percent. Think I'd like to meet this old man. Sweet. Thanks. My boss wants to meet you, old man. You're coming with us. Well, my advice is you should think long and hard before you make a big, big mistake, Tiny. Well, why don't you just show me? No problem. Get him. Get him! Oh, shit! Really? Fly. Hey! Hey! Did you just do that? You threw that bad man through the wall. How'd you do that? Well, little girl, you didn't see anything. See, that hole was already there. That's an optical illusion. - No, what I saw was you threw that man... - No, no. - You actually didn't see... - Hey, old man. Try this. Mayday! Come on! Sorry, kid. You all right? - Yeah. - Yeah? All right. I gotta go, kid. Nice meeting you. What? Is there hope on the horizon? As Granite City grapples with continued violence and mob uprisings caused by the return of Nemesis, could this remarkable footage, just in, mean that Samaritan is back, too? Mayday! Now, this young girl saw everything. Tell me, do you think it was Samaritan? My grandma told me a story about how Samaritan saved
