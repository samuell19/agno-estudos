Commemorating 100 years of Shochiku Cinema A Yoji Yamada film It's a Flickering Life "Cinema Companion" As rugby fever swept over Japan, no one thought the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and high school baseball would be called off. Maruyama, phone for you. Someone called Suzuki. - Company? - No idea. Don't stop! Don't stop! Hello, Maruyama here. Sorry to cold-call you. I'm Suzuki from Asia Holdings. Your father is Gohchoku Maruyama? Yes, he is. My company lent money to your father. He's behind on last month's payment. Listen. I've... got nothing to do with my father's debts. Of course. I just thought I should let you know. If he refuses to pay, we may have to visit your home... Go! Go! Go go go! Go go go! Hello! Sorry I'm late! Don't worry. It's only just begun. Good house for "Cinema Paradise"? Thankfully. Glad to hear it. Terashin. I've cleaned the restroom. I'll go now that Mizukawa's here. I'll be back day after tomorrow. Goodbye. Thank you. Yoshiko. Did your husband get his test result? He won't show me. He just insists he's fine. He says his back hurts now and then. That worries me. His liver's crying out from all that alcohol. I'll be strict with him. What's Goh doing today? Afternoon... horse racing? He works for the senior center on Fridays. He's probably toiling away, raking or something. "Horse Lovers" Leading Light stays ahead! The dark horse leads! Hang in there! Leading Light hangs on! Or will it be My Destiny? Hang in there! It's My Destiny at the finish! My Destiny wins! So much for the dark horse! Dammit! Uh-oh. Let's go. Just leave us alone today! Ow, ow! Don't make a scene. I'm not gonna get violent. I just wanna see your father to talk money. I'll call the police! Don't bother. Police can't get involved in civil affairs. Just let me see your father. I know he's home. Is that your mother back there? Take this and go for today! It's not enough, but too bad. Be sure to tell your father. I'll be back next month. Is Dad home?! In the bath. Five years ago, after I quit my old job, I used my severance pay to cover Dad's debts. "Ayumi, I'm sorry. I'll never get in debt ever again." He was crying and bowing there. You were bawling too, Mom. I believed what he said. I didn't cry. Yes you did! Your nose was running too. What was all that for? At lunchtime today, I got a call at work. I don't know if it was the same guy, but he sounded sleazy. "He's behind on his payments." My vision totally blacked out. I'm sorry, Ayumi. Don't apologize to me. Get angry with me! I'm angry too. - Are you really? - I am. Then you've got to make a scary face! You two are hopeless. That sure revived me! Honey! Beer! Coming. Mom! Don't say "Coming"! Why are you mad? Dad. You said you'd never use loan sharks again. Was that a lie? One was waiting outside just now. Some creep wanting money. It slipped my mind. So, he came here, huh... She paid him for you. With her own money. How much did you borrow? Hardly anything. Hardly anything at all. I'm down on my luck, but that'll change soon. When it does, I'll bet big, and win a few million easily. You've got some nerve to say that. I'm hungry. Make dinner! You got your pension today. Chip in for food money. I've got no cash. Can't pay by card? Little lady? No! Yuta. Your mom and your grandma are plotting to starve me to death! Going without food for a day won't kill you. Grandma, I'll eat in my room. Dad. Be honest with me. How much do you owe? Hardly anything, I said! H-Hey, stay here! Ayumi. I'll cancel my life insurance for a million. Could you help out too? You must have savings. You've worked a long time. If we don't pay, something terrible will happen. I won't help Dad anymore. I mean, I can't help him. I can't... ...extend my work contract now! Not the way my magazine's selling. You read fancy-pants film criticism like this? It's an interesting mag. Get this. Movies should make you feel something, in your heart. Not make you think in your head. My heart, huh? Yeah, your heart. Grandpa. Is gambling about heart? Dummy. Can't compare gambling and movies. What's fun about gambling then? Whether it's fun or not doesn't matter. It's just... ...an escape, for me. An escape from what? That ain't easy to answer. You're escaping too, from something. Maybe I am. You've got worries too, right? Grandpa, want to eat this? You sure? Go for it. I skipped lunch. I could eat a horse. Hey. Gimme water. Okay. I'd prefer beer though. No luxuries. Yes sir. Okay, next question. "I'd like my 78-year-old heavy-drinking father "to spend the rest of his life peacefully, so how can I cure his love of gambling, to pay off his debt?" 78, is he? It'll be difficult at his age. I went through the same thing with my father. I'm guessing your father has low self-esteem, and lacks confidence in himself. A lonely loner, unable to confide. That's right! He thinks he'll get over it someday, but depends on his family. Eventually, he can only find joy in drinking and gambling. Gambling addiction is a mental illness. It can't be cured easily. If you want to save him, start by adamantly refusing to cover his debts. Are you with me? Make him repay them. That's most important. His family must seize his pension and everything. If that doesn't work, make him declare bankruptcy, and cut all ties with his family. It's the only way. Why didn't you leave him? Dad wouldn't agree to it? Actually, he said "Okay." He even put his seal on divorce papers, years ago. So? What happened? I thought, if he went on to deal with his debt, alone, and live a miserable life, I couldn't live with myself. So you worked a sewing machine all these years to pay his debts? You cleaned up his messes for so long, you only made things worse. That counsellor said so. Dependence on gambling. Debt. And family. Dad's illness can be blamed on me and you too, Mom. As galling as that is. Hey, I was watching that. What? What's with the scary faces? Dad. What? We've made up our minds. We're not going to cover your gambling debts anymore. From now on, you pay them back. That means, we'll take possession of your pension and park cleaning pay, and pay your debts with it. We have to stop you from gambling. It's the only way. Get this straight. Gambling's what I live for. What right do you have to take away my only joy in life? Without horse racing... Without mahjong... What will your dad have to look forward to? You've got movies! Movies? That's right. Instead of gambling, you can watch your beloved movies! A long time ago, you used to make movies. You said that movies, and film itself, have a divine spirit within them, remember? Now it's time to seek the help of that divine spirit. We'll take your pension, but your Theater Ginmaku yearly pass, video rentals, satellite TV, we'll take care of all of that. From now on, watch movies and stay out of trouble. That's all. That's what we thought up, to end your gambling addiction, and save you from alcohol addiction. If you can't do it, you'll break up with Mom. Right Mom? Right. Are you outta your mind?! Mine's clearer than your booze-soaked brain. You'd... ...tell your mom and dad to break up? Yeah. Yoshiko! How can you let her say that? Darling. This time, I'm ready to take drastic measures. Don't you get it? Even if we break up, my debt'll follow you. No, it won't. Luckily, we're not your guarantors, so the burden of debt's on the debtor. Who is, you Dad, and nobody else. If you get divorced, Mom won't be burdened anymore. You listening? You understand? Gotta go. Wait! I told you. I'll take care of your money from now on. Leave your pension and bank cards here with me! Leave them! You're demonic! Listen. Ayumi isn't being mean. She doesn't want our assets, or you to provide for us. She only wants the four of us to live happily together! Dad. Cards. Where are you going?! The movies, where else?! No movies are playing at this hour. I'm all finished. What are you doing? This movie starts tomorrow. Gotta do a film check. I'm gonna screen it from now. I'll help. Your friend Goh's here. Where? Lying on a lobby sofa. At this hour? Goh? Why come so late? Lend me some cash. For booze? Yoshiko laid down the law to me. "Don't lend Goh any money." I want to give you money to drink, but I can't let Yoshiko down. That's more important. I'm outta here. Hey. I'm gonna screen an old movie. Watch it. What movie? From a Hiroshi Demizu retro. Starting tomorrow. Like old times. Demizu, huh? Which one? "Drifting Petals." Starring... ...Sonoko Katsura! Buddy, you were the assistant director for it. Go inside. Goh, it's showtime. Boss. That guy Goh asked me to lend him money, but I said no. Good on you. How are you friends with him? The longer you live, the more you go through. You'd better go. Gonna go hit on girls? I don't do that! Hey, you free? As if. Dumbass! Eri. - Dumbass! - Whoa. What's with you? Nothing. Theater Ginmaku Where is the Lily Room? This way. Excuse me. Hello. Come in. Sonoko Katsura. Every crew member loved her. Such a lovely woman. Oh... How kind of you. Have a seat. She had beautiful eyes. A little shortsighted. All part of her charm. Mt. Fuji. Hey Terashin. Time for Sonoko's closeup. Pay attention to her eyes. You'll see me in them. You, in her eyes? Get outta here. I'm reflected in them! Nobody else noticed in the preview room, but I saw it back then. At the cinema. How rude of me. My name's Ikehata. I'm... ...beside the camera, with a clapper. Your first name... Is it Yoshio? This shot! I'm Fumie! Look, there I am! Cut. Goh. How was that? A great performance. Okay, fine. We got an okay! Next shot's a wider angle. Goh. How was my acting just now? Great, I'd say. Why do you sound so unconvincing? Tell me if I was no good, Mr. Demizu. Like I always say, I don't care how actors act. You're just going to ruin my pictures with ham acting anyway. It's your job to make a ham actor act well. You could at least tell me how you want me to act. Actors like you think about emotion and acting well, so everything you do seems fake. Look at kids. Do they think about emotion? They don't think about acting well for better pay. You hate actors, don't you sir? Overseas, good actors are a dime a dozen. Such as? Bette Davis. Claudette Colbert. Greer Garson. I like Janet Gaynor too. Want to know who I don't like? Greta Garbo. Ava Gardner maybe. Oh really? I love Greta Garbo. Sir, let's do a test. Alright, let's watch our homegrown actors and their corny and unnatural acting. Forget it. I'm leaving, Goh. Only two shots to do. Even if I'm unnatural? You've got it. Test shot! Lower the mic. Test! Demizu team, rushes will now be screened. Come to the preview room. "Drifting Petals" "Director: Hiroshi Demizu" Move your legs. Watch it, jerk. Projectionist, the director and cameraman are here. Roger that. Hey there. Demizu team rushes. Demizu's new picture seems promising. Yeah? Like how? Just a feeling. "Just a feeling"? How exactly? You know, Demizu's rushes come across so bland by themselves. You're right. The camera's always eye-level. Vague long shots. Nothing but stiff acting. When those boring shots are cut together to make a movie, it's great somehow. I totally agree. Why is that, Terashin? Directorial talent, obviously. That's what movies are all about, Goh. Between each shot lives a divine spirit. The god of cinema. Roll it. The cinematic god. The god of cinema. - Thanks for waiting. - Thank you. Wow, this is the projection room? Hey Terashin! You've never had katsudon from Funaki, right? It's delicious. Thanks for last night. Hello. You know her. Funaki's next owner. He's Shintaro Terabayashi. Nickname Terashin. The diligent projectionist I trust most at this studio. He watches every picture made by this company. Over and over again. He knows movies better than me. - Cut it out. - See ya. Hey... Ask him anything. He reads a lot of books. This is where you work? Not pretty, is it? Why? Smelly oil and mechanical noise help make wonderful movies. I don't know about that... Mind if I take a peek? G-Go for it. That's Miss Sonoko! She's beautiful... Right. I'd better go back. You're Tera... What was it? T-Terashin. Mr. Terashin! I'm Yoshiko. "Yoshi" is written as "lady." I'm no lady though. Eat up while it's hot. I'll collect the bowl later. Bye. Hey, it's finished. Projectionist, wake up! Mister! Yoshiko dear. Over your cold? My doc told me it ain't a cold. What is it? Heartache. No doc's gonna cure it. Silly! "You... know me... ...all... too well." Keep going. "I feel like crying. Sumi dear, may I cry?" Fumie buries her face in laundry and cries. A child calls out from far away. "Hey! Auntie!" Sumiko. "Listen. Your boy's coming. Dry your eyes." Fumie. "Thank you, Sumi dear. Thank you." How's that? Brilliant. Maybe add something like this? "Sumi dear, you're a true friend." That's a great line. Unnecessary. Say a lot without saying it all. Complete but incomplete. Write haltingly, not fluently. That's screenwriting. We're done. I'll hand it out tomorrow morning. Sir, what about dinner? I'll eat at home. Yoshiko. Yes sir? Want to get married? I know a guy. Don't say that. This place can't survive without Yoshiko. Funaki depends on her. Right ma'am? Adopt a male heir then? Sir, no arranged marriage for me. Oh my... Keep saying that and you'll miss out. Be careful. Studios are full of delinquents. Don't be mean! Only delinquents want to work in movies. You too, sir? You bet. - Bye now. - Good night. Go straight home. Stay away from... ...the scent of makeup. Gimme a break. Goh, how about you? You're a delinquent too? Not me. Yes you are! Why? You play mahjong, love horse racing, and those utility actresses, Nobu and Mie. Really? Oh my... That's a lie. Don't talk garbage to Miss Sonoko. Watch it, Goh. I gotta get back to the studio to print this out. No sleep tonight! - Evening! - Hello. Hello! Where are you going? The Oda team staffroom. Goh's on location, right? The Izu Peninsula, I heard. Lucky him. Beautiful scenery and hot springs too. Poor you, Terashin. Stuck in a dark room all day. Rolling! Ready! Action! Kind gentlemen are so scarce. I'm not so extraordinary. Sorry! I flubbed the line! Cut! Sorry! Goh. Sound's added later! Lines don't matter, dummy! It's not his acting I want to shoot, it's these white waves! Goh! Go tell him! Mr. Okamura! We'll dub it later, so just fake it! Got it! Okay, one more time! Look, the sun's out! Rolling! Ready! Action! Hurry it up, dammit! How far did Sonoko have to go to pee?! The sun's setting! Sorry! Hurry up! She's on her way! Any time now! The house she went to is far! Dummy! She could've squatted in the grass over there! We've waited three days for clear skies! And it's gonna rain tomorrow! Only one minute of light left! Do something! It's setting! Goh! Run and tell the sun to wait! Go do something! Yes sir! Move! - Goh... - Wait, please! Don't! Goh! You idiot! The sun's not gonna wait! Tomorrow, we must part. I... don't want you to go. Hey Goh. Remember when you took me and Yoshiko? To the Izu Peninsula. In Sonoko's nifty American car. You forgot, you old dotard? Yoshiko. Look. If you turn this switch, cold air comes whooshing out. You can close the windows in summer. Right, Sonoko? Know what Mr. Oda said? What? "When did this studio become a market?" Meaning what? Hams get driven in by car. That's so mean, calling actors hams! Sonoko, don't touch it. It's hot. - Hey, Goh. - Yeah? Why'd you invite those two? You know why. I thought it'd be awkward if it was just us two. I was hoping to come here alone with you. Perhaps you don't want a certain someone to find out? There's nobody like that. Really? Yeah. Liar. Look at me and say that. There's nobody! I'll go get more water. Yoshiko. May I take a photo? Sure. Yoshiko, guess what? I've got movie film in this camera. Oh, is that so? From a camera assistant friend. Scraps of film. A piece of film that lasts a second in a movie can take 12 photos. Hey. Do you want to become a director? That'll never happen. Unlike Goh, I've got no creative talent. How do you know that? From talking with him. Talent's something you're born with. Then, what do you want to become? I'd like to be a film critic. But if I can't, I'll do my best to save up, build a little cinema in suburban Tokyo, and screen the films I love, for people who love films. That's... my distant dream. It's a lovely dream. So that's what you think of, in the dark. I know what I'll call my cinema. What's that? "Theater Ginmaku." As in "silver screen." Fumi... I'm glad I met you. Yoshiko? I knew he'd be here. Did you two fight? Sorry to cause trouble for you. I'd better wake him. Hey, Goh. Let him sleep a little more. Look. Do you recognize this movie? It's an old one. "Drifting Petals." Directed by Hiroshi Demizu. Mr. Demizu? That takes me back... Wow, Miss Sonoko. You'll star in Mr. Oda's film? But Oda's not easy to work with. He's demanding. I have to do exactly what he says. Just like last time. I had to stir my tea two-and-a-half times, put down the spoon, and drink. I did it nervously, then he said: "Sonoko dear, you only stirred it twice. I told you to do it two-and-a-half times." Like that. I felt so humiliated, I stirred my tea like crazy! Actors are raw material to Oda. They're only props. Not people. That's so mean! I don't think that way. What kind of director would you be? You're a playboy. That's not fair. Sure, I like mahjong and horse racing, but not just for fun. It nourishes my development as a director. What a bighead. Right, Yoshiko? Goh's writing a screenplay. It's quite original. What's it about? The protagonist's female. What's she like? W-Well, sh-she's... Beautiful. Like Sonoko. Yes, yes. I don't need your flattery. She has a husband. An irritatingly fussy man. Inspired by him. Why you... Terashin has delicate sensibilities. Unlike you, Goh. Sorry I'm a numbskull. Hey, no fighting. So what happens to the woman? What she really loves is movies. She scrimps and saves from what her tightwad husband gives her, to go and see movies. What does she watch? She's a fan of a star actor, and never misses his films. Right, Goh? If she can, she sees them two or three times. One day, she's watching one of his films as usual. Just some boring melodrama. But she only cares about seeing him. A beautiful wife, captivated by her star's closeups. Now comes the best part. The star up on the screen stops acting, turns around, and looks at her. A screen actor looks at a woman in the audience? How? The camera's here. The star's arguing with his lover's stubborn father. In mid-argument, he turns toward the camera. Or rather, he looks into the lens. Against the rules of cinema. The woman's startled, as if the star's looking at her. Then he speaks to her. "Ma'am, we meet again. For the third time today." The woman can't believe it. "Something wrong? You always look so sad. Why not tell me about it?" The star stands up. "I'll go to where you are." The star emerges from the screen and appears in the audience. How'll you film that?! Emerging from the screen. By using a screen process. The star leaves the screen and descends into the seats. Later, a love scene. They head to the Enoshima seaside. The star talks of the loneliness of his profession. Eventually, the sun goes down. Before returning to her cruel mother-in-law and husband, the star embraces her tightly! "No need to go back to them. Come with me and enter your silver screen dream." What fate awaits them?! Movie glamour versus dreary reality! How's that for a story?! It's fantastic. How do you think up such wonders? Yeah! Want to see it? I want to be in it! Thanks. You know, our company's melodramas and domestic dramas are treacly and sentimental. I'm sick of them. Frankly, that includes Demizu and Oda's work too. Men and women unable to express their love. A father forlorn over his daughter's wedding. Forget all that repressed human emotion, I want to do away with such outdated Japanese sentiment. Realistic films. Dry comedies. Dynamic, and unabashedly fantastic stories! That's what I'll make. His directorial debut already has a title too. What is it? "The God of Cinema." Hurry up and make it! Huh? You sleeping? Hey, Terashin. What's up with you? Goh? Are you eating properly? I brought you pressed sushi. Thanks. Hey Goh. I think I'll quit the studio and move back home. Why? This hurts too much. I want to forget about her. I need some distance. Who's "her"? Yoshiko. Yesterday, she paid me a visit. Bringing flowers. I felt so uncomfortable. I didn't know where to look. Where your ugly legs are now, I could see her pretty little knees. My heart was beating so fast. So... ...you like her, huh? I had no idea... ...just how painful it is to fall in love. Terashin. Write her a letter. A letter? A love letter. Send her one. I can't. She'd only laugh at me. You're such a dope! Get this. If a woman were to find out a man loves her so much that it makes him ill, she wouldn't laugh. If she did, she wouldn't be worth loving. It's Yoshiko we're talking about. She's as kind as they come. If she hears how you feel, she'll definitely be moved. She came to this filthy place. She cared enough to come check on you. Write to her. A love letter. Your handwriting's pretty, just like your prose. Are you sure about this? About what? Isn't there... ...something between you and her? There's nothing! Nothing between us! I mean, she's a sweet girl. To be honest, I might be sweet on her. But she'd be better off being with you. You'd be a perfect match for her! Not me. You mean that? Thanks. Okay. Go for it. Hey! Oda's team just wrapped. Five or six more to come. You alone? You're busy. Some other time. - Why not drink with them? - Nah. Goh! Get over here! Thanks anyway! Goh! Let's drink! Stop singing that! You'll rot my ears. Mukai team, Mukai team. Heading to location. Hello. Oh my. Mukai team? Goh. Haven't seen you at Funaki lately. I can't afford to go by myself much. Yoshiko wants to see you. Go see her. You can drink on my tab. Alright. That's kind of you. Say... Is there something between you and Yoshiko? There's nothing! What a womanizer. Hello. Closing already? Not for you. Yoshiko! Goh's here. Cook something for him. Hello. It's been a while. Something to eat? Or drink? Don't bother. I heard from Sonoko. You wanted to see me? I got a letter. From Terashin. Wow! He's great with a pen. Yes. Very pretty handwriting. So, what does it say? Let me guess. A love letter? That's great. I know exactly how he feels. He's a good guy. Clever, and studious. Well-mannered and dedicated. Why not go out with him and talk alone? Why won't you? Because... Don't tell me... ...there's some other guy? Oh man, there is? Why didn't you tell me? You should've. I get it. He doesn't work at the studio. Somebody I don't know. Right? Stupid. Numbskull. Yoshiko, I'll take my bath now. Close up for me. I'd better go. Goh! It's raining! I'll... write a letter to turn him down. Would you... take it to Terashin for me? Goh? Leaving already? Gotta piss! Hey, Terashin. You home? Come on up. Long time no see. You're drunk? Went to a movie in Yokohama. Shumai dumplings for you. I wanted to see you, but you weren't around. I had to help old Demizu do script research in Shinshu. Shinshu, huh? Must be nice there. You wanted to see me? What about? I wrote that letter. To Yoshiko. But I got no reply. It's okay though, if she doesn't like me. I just want to know how she feels. Yes or no. I was gonna... ...give you this right away, but I went to Shinshu. I'm sorry this is late. Goh, wait. Stay right there. Yoshiko asked you? To give me this letter? Well, she felt awkward, so I... You two... You've always liked each other, haven't you? If so, what about what you said to me?! I really meant what I said. I believed Yoshiko would be happier with you. That's the truth! Forget it. Come on, Terashin. Don't take that letter seriously. Women's feelings change easily. Meaning what?! How is that consolation?! Just calm down, okay? Let's drink somewhere and talk. Leave me alone! (Nine years earlier) Part-time staff wanted Am I... ...too old for the job? Your age isn't a problem. You look healthy to me. I can only pay the minimum wage for Tokyo, but if that's okay, I'd love to have you. Thank you. Do you like movies, ma'am? I saw a lot when I was young. What are your favorites? Let me think... Frank Capra's movies. They're old though. Oh? "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"? I saw "It's a Wonderful Life" so many times! Aha. About a miracle on a snowy day like this one. Yes. When I was young, my home was near a film studio, and we ran an eatery. Directors and actors often came. The film industry was still booming back then. You're Yoshiko! Don't you recognize me? My old face? Terashin! How's Goh doing? You're still together? Is he doing alright?! He's surviving somehow! He is? Goodness me, Terashin. I can hardly believe this. Oh my! What lovely flowers! Thank you so much. "Congrats on your film. From Hiroshi Demizu" Mr. Demizu sent Goh sake. It's finally starting. You'll visit the set, won't you? If I go there for no reason, won't it seem strange? It'll be fine. Don't you know? Everyone's talking. "Yoshiko's got prettier lately." Don't lie! Hey there. Hey there. Goh, congrats on your film! Thanks for taking part. Restroom. Are you alright?! He's been sick since yesterday. He's actually quite delicate. I understand. My first time on set, I went to the restroom many times. Even you? Oh yes. Goh's weak under pressure. I hope he has an ounce of Demizu's talent. He made all these notes... Good grief. So many... I'm starting to get worried. Film shoots are organic. They don't go according to plan, like this. He doesn't have to be as easygoing as Demizu, but... I'm concerned for Goh. Goh, want breakfast? Nope. No appetite. I couldn't digest it anyway. Goh! Wait a moment! It's your first battle, young samurai. Go! All the best! I'll bring hot tea and rice balls later! Goh, congrats. Thanks. Goh, hang in there! Hey, Director. Mr. Morita, thank you for this. Let's make it good. Goh... I mean, Director. Which necktie for Kenichi? His suit's navy. This one. - "Director: Goh Maruyama - The God of Cinema" Sonoko. Check your eye line. Is this good? Take the first shot from here. It has to be a closeup? It does. Alright, how about this? First, pan up from opening the lid, into Sonoko's closeup. Then Sonoko passes the bowl to her husband. Here you go. Sounds good to me. Okay, change to a pan up from her hands. What about me? You can skip this shot. Oh! Oh, excuse me! Sorry! Is he okay? Hey Goh. Make a good movie. Thanks! Miho, enough. Outta the shot! That took forever. Roll on this one. Rolling! Quiet! Goh. Go for it. Ready... Scene 1, Take 1! Synchro number 1! Action! Hey, no laughing! Sorry, Director. Goh? What's up with him? Diarrhea since this morning. Director bathroom break! Gary Poo-per. Can he get through this? - May I come in? - Sure. Hello. Where's your director? Kimura, come in. Say, Kazuko. Where were you at noon? I told you. Out shopping. Don't lie! Stop there! I want this shot from overhead. I can't do this. I don't get you at all. Basically, their marriage is a formality. I want to objectively express that their love is barren. I follow your logic, but it's better to shoot it wide from the deck. Not this weird position. What's weird about it? Overhead is weird. Have it your way. I give up. I'll obey your wisdom. Don't talk like that. Come on. All you do is go against what I say! Goh, calm down. I just want to do right by your film. No more overhead. We'll do it your way and shoot it mundanely. Don't be hasty. Forget it... What the?! Emergency! The director's hurt! Call an ambulance! Today's shoot for Goh Maruyama's team is called off. Crew, stand by. Repeat. Today's shoot for Goh Maruyama's team is called off. Crew, stand by. You tried to resign? Did the chief accept it? He said he'd hold onto it for now. But... he looked disappointed. Don't talk so recklessly, Goh. Don't waste your knowledge. You've got talent! I've got none. Not an inkling of Demizu and Oda's talent. I know that now. You're wrong. You're wrong! Only you could write "The God of Cinema." A star emerging from a screen. Easily transcending fiction and reality. Neither Oda or Demizu could think of that! Wrong. It's only a flight of fancy. I realized when I came to direct it. Crazy, childish imagery like that would never work. Like a kid's comic. - So what?! - I'd be ridiculed. Wait, wait. Think calmly. The studio and I have made up our minds. I'll go home, and help with my dad's business. This is goodbye for you and me. So long. Hey. What about Yoshiko? I didn't promise to marry her. Too bad. We'll break up. But that's cruel! You can have her. "Have her"? She's not an object! She's a human being, you know! You're still in love. With her. Damn you... If you weren't injured, I'd knock you silly! Goh! You recovering okay? Thanks. What a relief. My hair ain't gonna recover. Tomorrow, I'm going away on location for a while. There's something I need... ...to say before I go. You could ignore your mother's protests, and go to Okayama to struggle through life with Goh. In my melodramas, that'd be a happy ending, but not in reality. Goh's a good kid. But, if you choose him, life'll be hard for you. Goh won't be able to make you happy. Best to rethink it. Sir. It's not your business! Yoshiko! Mr. Demizu kindly came during work for you... Mother, stay out of this! Goh needs me right now. I don't need him to make me happy! I'll make him happy instead! Please forgive her... Yoshiko! That was rude of you! She's a good girl. Yokohama Station at 9:20? Don't worry. We'll make it easily. Miss Sonoko, I'm sorry. No need to apologize. I'm actually quite glad. I'm helping you make the decision of a lifetime. I'm all nervous. After all, you might regret getting married to Goh. You'll also regret it if you don't. You choose what to regret. That's how life is. I just can't let go of Goh. Then don't. Goh's a lucky man. I don't have much on me, so take this as a parting gift. Sell it if you need to. - It's too much... - Take it. Give my regards to Goh. Tell him, if he hurts you, he'll have to deal with me. I will. The End That was our last screening for today. Please go home together nicely. Yoshiko, are the trains still running? It's alright. We'll make the last one. You can take it home. What about you? I can't go back to that psycho daughter of mine. Terashin. Something wrong? Goh says he won't go home. Don't worry. He can stay with me. Thank you again. I'll bring his medicine tomorrow. Good night. Hey. Gimme some money. If you end up dead, it's not my fault! Dad walked out on us, like always, so no one worried. Not long after that, I lost my contract job, and began searching for work. No. 23, Ms. Ayumi Maruyama. - Here. - Thanks for waiting. How do you do? Your grandma home? No. Long time no see. You good? What do you do all day, staring at that computer? Games? No. I'm doing web design. Making homepages and things. This one's for Mr. Terashin. Theater Ginmaku. Does it make money? More or less. I bet you got nothing to spend it on. Got a lot saved up? Well, you could say that. Yuta. I had a dream last night. Guess what it was about? How would I know? Listen good. I was fishing in a pond. Plop! A pond so quiet, you can hear a frog dive in. On the surface, a snow-white snake came gliding toward me. The white snake stared with its two red eyes, seemingly at me, then in a flash... Badoosh! It jumped at me, and bit down on my hand! I panicked! Then I woke up. You get me? That white snake was a god of gambling. It biting me means I've got a huge win waiting around the corner! So! Gimme some money. You won't regret it this time. I'll add loads of interest, and multiply your money. Horse racing's still on today. Please! I'm begging you. Hey. Say something! Will you or won't you?! I won't. Hey. Do you plan on being a gambling addict and alcoholic, till you die as a pathetic old man? Yeah. Got a problem? I sure do. You're much more than that. The truth is, you're abundantly talented. I was shocked to find that out, by reading this. "The God of Cinema" That's my screenplay. Where'd you get it? Mr. Terashin lent it to me. I was amazed. He hung onto it all this time? So, you really read it? How was it? It's an old relic now. I was immature. It's lousy, right? You read it to "The End"? I finished it in one sitting. It's awesome. Oh please. Don't butter me up just because I'm old. I'm not. I'm dead serious. You've got talent! It was really that good? It was. What was so good about it? The characters are memorable, and it's funny. Most of all, that. Where that place marker is. A movie star comes out of the screen to talk to his female fan. That part! How on earth did you come up with it? You know, I got it from a silent film by the genius Buster Keaton. Why didn't you make it? I got as far as the start of filming, but... What happened? How can I put it? Well... The lead was a newcomer, and he was so nervous, he got diarrhea on day one. Constant toilet breaks. Plus, he fell off the set. A nasty bump on the head. I lost the will to keep going, and the movie went up in smoke. What a waste. So... You liked it... It's a masterpiece. You've got great taste. After all, you're my grandson. A masterpiece, huh? Grandpa. Let me type up your script and submit it to a competition. We can go for the Kido Prize. 1 million yen. This is no time for horse racing. 1 million yen! It'll never win. It must be outdated by now. Then we'll update it. Modernize it. Oh... Let's do it together. We've both got time to burn. We do. Even so, a screenplay I wrote eons ago won't win 1 million yen. It's like a dark horse in a race. Your snake dream was a sign. It's a sure bet! You... wanna take a gamble on me? Grandpa, I'm serious! Don't laugh, let's begin from Scene 1. Read it! Now then... "Scene 1: Kazuko's Home. An early spring morning at a suburban house with a tiled roof." Let's make it an apartment. Sure. "...a stylish suburban apartment." I'm home. Hello dear. Has Dad come home? They're up to something. Wait. Your interview result? "We regret to inform you that we cannot hire you at this time. Best wishes for your future endeavors." How kind of them. Ayumi. Don't get angry. Why not try asking Katsumi? About hiring you. He's a section chief at Hobokusha now. You must be joking. The man who betrayed me? I won't talk to him. Come now, he's still Yuta's father. Shouldn't he help you at a time like this? How can you think like that? Don't you have any pride, Mom? May I say this? Say what? Something that'll hurt me again? Dad... ...left you for a woman once. I was in high school. How could you forgive him? I haven't forgiven him. Then why stay? I thought of leaving him many times. But... When it came down to it... You can't do it. You love him after all. That drunken womanizer. Don't be so hard on me. Grandpa, hold up. You should add this note. "It's the film's last day. Her last meeting with screen star Masaki." Clever. Go on and add it. You're a natural at this. Dad, you're back. What are you two doing? We're writing. You're a distraction. Next is Kazuko's monologue. "Masaki, I won't see you ever again. I'm so sad!" It's excessive. Like some old period piece. Okay, cut it! Masaki whispers into Kazuko's ear. "I've always watched you, from the screen. Talking to you like this feels like a dream." Grandpa. It's the most important scene, but it's cringey. What should we do? How about this? Masaki whispers in Kazuko's ear. "Say, are you single?" "No, I have a husband." "Are you happy?" Kazuko... sadly shakes her head. You know your stuff, for a virgin! Great. Go with that! On cruise ship Diamond Princess, where a mass infection has occurred, 39 more cases have been confirmed. Early in the new year of 2020, as worrying news began to break around Japan, our little family received a delightful surprise. Terashin! Mr. Maruyama?! Sorry! This... This... This... What's wrong, Goh?! Water! Gimme water! Call an ambulance? Not yet! "Cinema Magazine" Mrs. Maruyama. Your husband's here. He wants you. What for? Something's off. He's always off. Today's different. I'll take over for you. Holy crap! Ugh, nasty! Whoa! Yoshiko, this is serious. A really big deal! Oh no. What has he done? You did something bad?! No, dummy! Read this here. What is it? The Kido Prize. A famous award for screenplays. Come on, read this! Read it. Hey. Read it calmly. Don't wet yourself in surprise. "The winner is a 78-year-old first-time screenwriter." "Grand Prize: The God of Cinema." "Gohchoku Maruyama." Oh my. That's you, dear! I wrote it with Yuta. The screenplay for "The God of Cinema." We entered it as a long shot, and our dark horse came in! A million yen. One million yen! Don't lie! I ain't lying! Wow... Goh, come here. Come here! What?! Everyone! Your attention please! I'm the manager here! The Kido Prize is our country's most prestigious screenplay award, and this year's winner has been announced! It was written by this man right here! A Theater Ginmaku member like you all, and also my old friend! Once a movie director in the making, now a 78-year-old novice screenwriter! Mr. Gohchoku Maruyama! Thanks. Congratulations! Thank you. Thank you so much! Miracles really do happen. It totally blew me away! The Kido Prize! That Kido Prize! Dad won it! Huh? You're worried? About what? Listen, if they pay him one million in cash, he'll fritter it away. On horses and mahjong. We've got that sorted. Yuta looked into it. A bank transfer. I have Dad's card. Rest assured, Mom. See you later. Thank you, Yuta. Use the whole prize money to pay his debts. His debts can wait for the time being. We've gotten by up till now. What I'm happy about... What I'm happy about... ...is that you... ...recognized him as a man with talent worth respecting. After all, I... I was seriously... ...considering cutting ties. I wanted him to go away, for real! Even though he's my father... Thanks. "78-year-old newcomer wins Kido Prize" "Oldest winner ever" "Kido Prize party at Theater Ginmaku" Mr. Maruyama! It's your talent, not your age! Write more and more great screenplays, and reinvigorate Japanese film! Go for it, old fella! Go for it! Now then, let's ask Mr. Maruyama to give us a song! Okay! How about "Block 4"? It's about time! Higashimurayama Lake Tama's just down the road In tea-growing Sayama Everyone's your friend Higashimurayama Block 4 Higashimurayama Block 4 Higashimurayama Block 3 Drop, drop, drop on by Stop by sometime in Block 3 Honey, I'm home! Good evening! Oh dear, Mizukawa. You brought him home? Tonight, I had a drink with a young director he knows. They want to make a movie of my screenplay. "If you'll direct it, it's yours for free," I said. Thank you. But... I'll have a say in the casting. Right, Mizukawa? Hey! Come in for a drink! You too, miss! Okay. He's such a bother. I'm so sorry. We'll go now. Thank you so much. Good night. Good night. Honey, gimme water. All you do is drink. Your friends come from the racetrack, mahjong, and who knows where. "Congrats! Way to go, Goh!" "Thanks! Let's head out!" Boozing though you're broke. My prize money'll cover it. Your health is my concern. What if you get ill? No prize ceremony for you then. What's this? It's from Terashin. He asked me to give it to you. Oh my! Who's that? She's a cutie. I don't know. Who could she be? Look at her smile. I wonder how that girl's doing now? I wonder too. Is she living happily? I bet she's... ...with a good hard-working man. That would be nice. A non-drinker. A non-gambler. A non-joker. An earnest gentleman. Yoshiko, I feel... bad... Yuta! Yuta! Grandpa's ill. Call an ambulance! 46th Kido Prize award ceremony Now then, let's introduce the winners and present the awards. The winners will receive a certificate and a watch, and the Grand Prize winner will be awarded 1 million yen. The four runners-up will be awarded 100,000 yen each. Oh, this is it. I told you to get me beer! I ain't drinking that! Don't want it? Then don't. It should be starting. What is? Your award ceremony. What award? It's a bit late to play coy now. The Kido Prize award ceremony's beginning! Look, it's Yuta. Calling for you. Your grandpa? He's right next to me. Grandpa, listen to this. Get a grip, man! Congratulations. Without further ado, let's introduce the winner of the Grand Prize. He's been big news in film circles this year. 78-year-old novice screenwriter, Mr. Gohchoku Maruyama! His winning screenplay is "The God of Cinema." Sadly, Mr. Maruyama is ill and unable to attend, so his daughter Ayumi will accept on his behalf. Ms. Maruyama, please. They're giving her the certificate. Next, the watch, and 1 million in prize money. Cash? Probably just a promissory note. Written on paper. "Promissory note." This is alcohol! Sneaky little... "Promissory note" Now, Ms. Ayumi Maruyama, please say a few words on behalf of your father. Last night, I saw my father in hospital. I asked him what I should say here, and he... ...wrote something down, and gave it to me. I'll read it to you now. Hey, what did you write? I forgot. You can hang up now. Hang up! - Hang up! - No! "Honey. Yoshiko. My sweet Yoshiko. Thank you. I owe you, for everything. For me surviving all these years. You kept me alive. I'm grateful. Truly, grateful. My dearest daughter Ayumi. I beg your forgiveness. I've been a poor excuse for a father. Please forgive me." My first tears in years. You're a wizard with scripts, Goh. Very cleverly written. I wasn't being clever. I was honest about how I feel! I know that. You're finally taking stock of your life too. Now you can quit gambling and booze, live peacefully and humbly, and make Yoshiko happy. Soon, your family will bring flowers and stuff. I'll... go back to work. Congratulate them for me. Hey Terashin. What? Yoshiko... What about Yoshiko? Yoshiko should've chosen you! Goh. Don't even joke about that. You... ...succeeded in fulfilling your dream of opening a cinema! She chose wrong. Yoshiko did. "She chose wrong"? You feel sorry for her, huh?! If you do, if you truly do, you can still make things right! You damn fool! Dammit! My hospital-hating father frequently tried to escape, and was practically kicked out... ...but the world that awaited him had changed drastically. As an emergency declaration loomed, he insisted on going to see a screening of one of Mr. Oda's films, so we reluctantly turned it into a family outing. The Maruyamas are here. Terashin. Thank you for all your help. Good to see you, Goh. All better now? He insisted on seeing it here. Mr. Oda's "A Story of Tokyo." I said a DVD would do, but he wants to die watching a movie here. I never said that. It must've started. It's over halfway through. You all made me late! Of all the nerve... Yuta, sit here. That seat has to stay empty. Social distancing. Social what?! Just be quiet, okay? It's a worrying situation. The emergency declaration's forcing you to shut down. I never expected this to happen at my age. Business is bad, Ayumi. I don't think I can go on much further. The Kido Prize money. It was 1 million yen, but we used 300,000, and only have 700,000 left. Goh insists on donating all of it to you, Terashin. He actually said that? Even so, it won't be enough to keep you going, will it? I've been talking to your members. To get through this, we could raise money by crowdfunding, or ask film industry people to approach the government. I'll do my best, so don't let this get you down. Ayumi, aren't you too busy for that...? I've got time. I'm unemployed. I'll work hard for you. Please. Terashin. Take this money, and use it. You're making me cry... Alright. I'll accept it, gratefully. I've never given money to Terashin before. Your first and last time. God of cinema, please protect us. Oh. Yuta. Know that actress's name? I know. Sonoko Katsura. A star of years gone by. She was a friend of mine, you know. We were pretty close. Maybe she'll spot you and step out from the screen. "Goh? Oh my." "You look so old." Like that? Oh my! Goh. Oh my... You look so old. Y-You... ...look so beautiful, as always. Stop it. You don't have to flatter me. Say... Are you still together? You and Yoshiko. Children? A daughter. And a grandson. A fine young man. So, you both must be happy. I'm happy, but... What about Yoshiko? Well... I don't know... You're not sure? Don't worry. If you're happy, I'm sure Yoshiko is happy too. I'm a little envious though. You womanizer. Now then. My train's waiting. Back to work. Goh, let's go. Go where? To the set! Have you forgotten? Oda's crew asked you to help. Oh, did they...? Come... ...Goh. Alright. Sorry I'm late! Let's go. Dad! An ambulance! Dad! Hey! Dad! Dad! - Camera ready? - Ready. Lighting ready? Ready. Then let's roll! Rolling! Goh, do the clapper. Let's go. My father's wish to die while watching a movie must have been... ...granted by the god of cinema.
