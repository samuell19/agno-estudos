Have you been well? Rest in peace Mr. Mayor! It's been so long. You are? -The mayor from the next village over. -Ah! Mayor Chu, welcome. Long time no see. - Say hello to Mayor Chu In-hwe. - Please sit over there. Governor, you must be busy with the election. Don't call me governor yet. I barely won the primary. - Sit down. - Sir, good to see you. Sit, sit. How's the campaign going? I need a lot of help. Please volunteer for the province. Of course! We're not strangers, we're doing well thanks to you, we'll do all we can. Stop mincing words. Come on, let's toast to the new governor! Stop! We don't toast at a funeral. You can't hide stupidity and poverty. That's good. This tastes funny. Yeah? It's fermented well. What's going on with the casino? - The casino? - Yeah. I don't know the details. Our citizens of Daecheon just have to live prosperously, no? Your love for our hometown is endless. When things go bad, you lure a casino in and get our children jobs. We're well off thanks to you. Say no more! We all must repay your kindness, or we would be animals. Your son got a subcontract with DL Construction, you sent your daughter to Las Vakas to become a dealer, right? It's Las Vegas, you bonehead. No wonder your son failed everything. Don't blame your stupidity on your son. CHU: You named your sons Quartz and Mercury. You had to name them after minerals? [LAUGHING] Bud, wipe your nose, it's so nasty! Don't blow your nose my way, it got on me earlier. So nasty. [CHAE SINGING] I must be out of my mind. I'll be right back. Mrs. Chae. CHAE: ♪ Sitting in the flower bed... ♪ CHU: My deepest sympathies. ♪ Watching the petals... ♪ Are you okay? ♪ Where did this pretty color come from? ♪ CHU: I'm so sorry. CHAE: ♪ Such a beautiful flower ♪ ♪ Such a great day ♪♪ [DOOR OPENS AND WOMAN GROANS] How is this a great day? Jesus Christ! [EXCLAIMS] Why isn't your hotshot daughter from Seoul here?! The burial is tomorrow! Why do you care?! Does it make sense for his daughter not to be here? How dare you speak about my daughter! [♪♪♪] My brother is dead! He's my blood! You raised your kid all wrong! What? You've never had a child! What did you say?! Stop that! Let her go! Don't you dare badmouth her! [ALL CLAMORING] MAN 1: Hey, Jung-su! Buddy, leave that! Give me that! You bastard! Hey! Jung-su! Jung-su! Come here! Mayor! Sir! MAN 2: Someone call 911! 911! Innocence The evidence from the previous trial lacked credibility. The defendant supposedly murdered his wife, put her in the tub, and started a fire in order to destroy the evidence. So he must have had a device of some kind to keep the fire under wraps for an hour and a half, but no special devices were found at the scene. [ALL MURMURING] Also, time of death noted in the original trial, which was before 8, when the defendant was home, I have a witness who will refute that. Terry Wilder is a forensic scientist who performed over 5,000 autopsies, and analyzed murders all over the world. [IN ENGLISH] In case of high temperatures, such as at the scene of a fire, it's almost impossible to estimate the time of death because the body decomposes really fast. [IN ENGLISH] Simply says, you're saying there's something wrong with the evidence presented by the original trial? WILDER: Actually, it's absolutely impossible to say with certainty that the victim died before or after 8:00. However, I disagree with the autopsy report saying that the victim died before 8:00. [IN KOREAN] That is all. A gift from the pharmaceutical boss's wife. Buy a Hermès bag with it. [MAN SPEAKING IN KOREAN ON TV] If we shut down the Supreme Court, we'll get IH's account for good. The firm will be set for the year thanks to you. Ha-ha-ha. You haven't heard? I decided not to take on the Supreme Court appeal. What do you mean? You won this massive case. I took on this case because of you, but this is where I draw the line. Why is our best attorney pulling our leg? Sir, be selective when taking on new cases. If we only represent thugs, we too become thugs. Be sensitive to the crime, not to money. Hmm. MAN [ON TV]: A harrowing incident took place. At a funeral in the township of Daecheon, a guest has died after drinking pesticide-spiked rice wine, and four others are in serious condition. Among the victims is incumbent Mayor Chu In-hwe. [♪♪♪] A prime suspect, Mrs. Chae Hwa-ja, has been arrested and investigated. I forgot about an urgent matter, I better go. - We're not done. - My apologies. Hey! [CELL PHONE RINGING] Yes, Ms. Ahn. My case wrapped up well thanks to you. Detective, I have a favor to ask you. Could you look into Daecheon pesticide case? Sure, I'll look into it and call you back. Okay. [CONTROL PANEL BEEPS] [♪♪♪] Recommendation Letter: Seoul National University. Your eyes! I told you not to look at me like that! Huh? Whenever you look at me, I'm reminded of bad things! Whatever you want to do, you can't do it until I'm dead! Huh? You'll never get out of here! Never! [DOOR OPENS] Are you crazy? Stop it! TAE-SU: Don't even think about it, bitch! Mom... We spent a lot of money on Jung-su. Let's talk later. Why should you die?! Staying strong to stay alive is barely enough! You can't die! I should be the one! You don't recognize me? I don't really know. Who are you? I'm a lawyer, I've got some questions. Do you remember what happened at the funeral? Funeral? Did someone die? You don't remember people drinking poisonous rice wine? Rice wine was poisonous? Oh. Is Jung-su okay? He's fine. Where am I? I have to go home. [GASPS] [♪♪♪] I need to prepare a meal for him. JUNG-IN: How far has her dementia progressed? MAN: Has she recently had a traumatic experience? We'll need to do a thorough exam. She needs treatment right away, but in her circumstances... JUNG-SU: Kitty! Kitty! MAN 1: Jung-su, you can't play here! JUNG-SU: Kitty! Kitty! That bastard! Officer! Get him! Officer Lee! This is a crime scene, get out of here. I'm a lawyer, also the prime suspect's immediate family. Immediate family? "Ahn Jung-in." Jung-in? It's me, Choi Seok-gu, from the mill. Ah. Why are you here? I became a cop, this is my case. I heard you were a hotshot in Seoul. I didn't recognize you. It was batshit crazy. MAN 2: Sergeant, take a look at this. [OBJECTS CLATTERING] CHOI: People dying at a funeral. Does this make sense? Mr. Ji died like that, and my dad's barely hanging on. - I'm sorry this happened at my home. - That's all I get? I may have to bury him soon! Kitty! CHOI: Jung-su! You idiot! [MEN SHOUTING] [CAT SHRIEKS] I got it! CHOI: You bastard! You're ruining the crime scene! What are you doing? Are police allowed to use violence? The thing is... JUNG-SU: Return a slap with two! Don't sit back, hit back. That's what Mom said. Did you drink pesticide too? [MEN SHOUTING] Son of a bitch! MAN 1: Mr. Ji died when he arrived in the ER, and we intubated others and put them on respirators. MAN 2: Methomyl that was found at the crime scene, and the pesticide found in the victim's bodies, and pesticide discovered on Mrs. Chae's clothes all match up. SHIN: Mr. Bang Jung-hwan, you stated that you saw Mrs. Chae acting weird at the funeral, could you explain? I left the funeral early, because it was near bank closing hours, but I wanted to greet her so I went back, and I saw Mrs. Chae Hwa-ja and Jung-su pouring rice wine into the pot. There were many pesticide bottles next to them! My son doesn't know anything! He didn't do anything! Please calm down! [CROWD MURMURING] This isn't the right one. She may have signed the confession during interrogation, but she does not admit to... When did you sign this? [♪♪♪] [CROWD CLAMORING] WOMAN: Chae Hwa-ja, you bitch! Hwa-ja! Are you okay? Take care of Jung-su! Okay, don't worry! I'll look after him! JUNG-SU: Mom! Mom! Mom! CHAE: Jung-su! Mom! Mom! CHAE: Jung-su! LAWYER: Don't worry too much! Aren't you Jung-in? You don't greet your aunt after more than 10 years away? Did you retain this lawyer? Who is she? She's my lawyer niece from Seoul. [CHUCKLES] I saw you on TV, you look prettier in person. - So good to meet-- - Sir. They've got no concrete evidence, it's all circumstantial. Why haven't you objected? Anyone can see that initial investigation was messy! Are you doing your job or not? One moment. It's only been 12 hours since I took on this case. Even so, the suspect has no prior and she's not a flight risk. How could she be detained for signing the confession? You might be good but you're not the only lawyer! I only took on this case out of pity for a petty sum. Ma'am, I'm done with this case as of now. What? Wait! Sir! LAWYER: I'm done! How could you just show up and mess everything up?! A lawyer like him will help create new charges. Even if you're all that, how could you not even show up at your father's funeral?! I'm done with this too! How could your mom cremate him instead of burying him? Ugh. MAN: Ms. Ahn. Has your judgment been clouded as it's a family matter? Looking beyond that, it's still a weird case. Crime scene integrity and initial investigation were messy. Every client of ours says they're being treated unfairly. Sir, am I right? Pharmaceutical chair protecting her son, Ahn wanting to protect her mom, how are they different? This isn't about that, this case is different. How could someone who doesn't recognize her child do this? She said it's different, we must take her word. I'll send a lawyer there. Why don't you focus on the pharmaceutical case? Hm? The pesticide case will be over when the defendant is released on sick bail. Please allow me to do this, I'll be quick. How dare you show up here after killing my husband! I'm investigating the case as a lawyer. That makes it all right? Don't pull that shit on me! We helped out because we felt sorry for her. Then she poisoned us? How is this possible? Don't got methomyl pesticide anymore. It got banned because it had too many problems. But, Uncle, why are people like this to our family? It's because of that incident, money is evil. Has it been like this since the mine scam? Don't even mention it. After I lost my savings, your aunt and I got a divorce. Imagine how those who aren't related to us felt. But how could anyone mix pesticide in rice wine? Your mom is so unfortunate. Jung-in, do you still hate your mom? Don't do that! [♪♪♪] She's a pitiful person. JUNG-IN: The witness testimonies could be lies. I think there was a trespasser. There are too many suspicious things. I think she was framed. She only signed the confession because your brother could be named co-conspirator. Detective, did you get what I asked for? Do not tell anyone that you got it from me. [♪♪♪] [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] As you see here, they bullied and screamed at the defendant, then they promised her to let her go if she signed it, so why would anyone not sign it? We also noticed inconsistencies on photos submitted by the prosecution. Do you see the bottle prints on the ground? They were placed here but moved for the convenience of the police. You're accusing us of evidence tampering? Quiet please! Mr. Bang testified that he went to the bank before closing, but he was nowhere to be found in their security camera feed. We suspect perjury. The preliminary investigation was conducted with suspicion, it's a targeted investigation. SHIN: Targeted investigation? Bottles of pesticide were found at the defendant's residence, the same pesticide was found on her clothes, and she confessed to the crimes during interrogation. What other proof do you need? Then please take a look at these photos. So a prosecutor, detective and witness can't dine together? The men in this photo are the prosecutor, primary detective and the witness. Det. Choi and Mr. Bang went to the same school since elementary and are sons of victims of this case. [ALL MURMURING] Do you still deny this isn't a targeted investigation? In addition, the defendant's health is deteriorating. The detention doctor's report indicates how far along her dementia is. To get to the truth, her treatment is urgent. We request detainment to be lifted. CHU: Release from custody? [♪♪♪] Does that make sense? How could you mess it up? It's obvious Hwa-ja did it! How could you mess it up since her kid showed up? I'm sorry. Mayor Chu, you should first go to the hospital. Don't ever! Let her get released! Did you look into what I asked? We are still looking, sir. Find it at once! Give Chief Prosecutor Shin a call. DOCTOR: It looks to be rapidly progressive dementia. The shrinking of her brain must've affected her judgment, memory and cognitive ability. At this rate, she should be out on medical release. Chief Doctor's Secretary: Director would like to see you Could we follow up later? My apologies. Sure. [ELEVATOR CHIMES] [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] [♪♪♪] Where's Mom? [CELL PHONE BUZZING] Yes? That's correct. You found her? [MEN SHOUTING] Mom! [SIREN WAILS] Mom... My baby, my dear boy... - Did you have dinner? - Yeah. Baby, this is that place. It's here! This is the place. Get up! Don't cause a scene and get up! JUNG-SU: Mom, Mom! JUNG-IN: Where are you taking her? The court's order is to take her back. Aren't you... Jung-in, by any chance? And you are? Chopyung Elementary, 6th grade, class 3. I'm Wang-yong. Oh. It's been a while. You became a cop? Wow, you're still... Still same old... If you're not busy, could we talk at the station? WANG-YONG: About three months ago, I was on night shift and your mom came in soaking wet. [AS CHAE] "My husband is a killer! Mayor Chu and his friends are all in on this!" [IN NORMAL VOICE] I calmed her down and sent her away, but she refused to go home for a few days and caused a scene. We finally found her by the reservoir like before. Was there a murder there? No way! We got a commendation for crime-free village too. She's got dementia, she doesn't even recognize me. I thought this'd help, I shouldn't have done that. There are so many weird things about this case. It's driving me crazy, and my mom is sick. She was close to Mr. Hwang, so she had no ill will against him, but circumstantial evidence is there. What do you think? No! Your mom would never do that! Anything I should know about, stuff happening in the village? Aside from the casino ruckus, this is the biggest case. Casino? Here? Yeah, a casino's being built in the mountains behind the village. [♪♪♪] [SIGHS] CHU: And the casino? They're asking for a few more days. Once the construction is done, they may not pay me. I can't run my campaign without a payoff. I'll revoke their permit if they don't pay by the end of the month! [KNOCKING ON DOOR] [DOOR OPENS] Come in! [CHU CHUCKLING] [DOOR CLOSES] So you stopped her medical release? Mrs. Chae is back in custody. When today's documents are included, it's all but dismissed. [EXCLAIMS] Chief Prosecutor Shin, you do some great work. [CHU CHUCKLES] JUNG-IN: Aunt, I have a question. Who introduced you to the first lawyer? AUNT [ON PHONE]: I don't know. We somehow ended up retaining him. Why? You're not gonna take the case? I just wanted to check something. I think someone asked me to. I don't remember, who was it... Does it have something to do with the casino? Casino? Heh. I don't know what you mean. I heard you specialize in civil cases, no? [CHUCKLES] There's no specialization out here in the country. Ah. I'm sorry but I'm quite busy. Extremely busy. Heh-heh. My apologies, please forgive me. Take care. CHU [ON PHONE]: What did she say? She asked me why I took on the case, then she brought up the casino all of a sudden. Probably to confirm something, there's no need to worry. She's pretty like a doll. I'll call you right back! - I'm sorry. - What is it? I think I left my cell phone. Oh, my, should I call you? Ah. It's right here, goodbye. Yeah, I don't have your number anyway. LAWYER [ON RECORDING]: She asked me why I took on the case, then she brought up the casino all of a sudden. [♪♪♪] Mayor Chu Casino CHAE: "My husband is a killer!

Don't touch that! Maintain crime scene integrity! The letter L? Did the prints get ruined? I found it! I found it! I found it! Ah! I got it! Jung-in! I got it! The footprint! I think the neon shoes you saw were... Lecaf. Look, the sole pattern is identical, no? You're right. A few months ago, there was a massive sale on these. Was there anything else? Oh. I think I scratched his face. Ah. He had a burn mark on his face. Burn mark? Why didn't you say so?! Daecheon Karaoke, Lecaf shoes and burn mark. SHIN [ON PHONE]: Mr. Bang's father passed away. So Bang's finally gone. [♪♪♪] Pick out some nice flowers for him. By the way, are you going to let her mess around like that? I'll take care of it, sir. [TITTERING] You should have a drink too. [SHIN CHUCKLES] You're a handsome fella. Thank you. Do you like taking pictures? Could I take a look? Ahn Jung-su! JUNG-SU: Yeah? What are you doing? Who are you? I've been assigned to your case. So you were at the Seoul Central District Court? Chief Prosecutor Shin Cheol-min A lot of parties are interested in this case. Good to meet you. If anyone asks you anything, just say you don't know. Don't talk to anyone except me, got it? Hey, you got a light? No smoke, bad! Cigarette smoke contains nickel, naphthylamine, benzene, vinyl chloride! Why are you being rude? I was just asking for a light, you're the one being fucking rude. [♪♪♪] You're Ahn Jung-in from Daecheon High School, right? You're glaring at me, bitch! No! Don't hit my sister! Protect family, that's what Mom said! Who's this idiot? [JUNG-SU GRUNTING] JUNG-IN: Stop it! MAN: Causing a fucking scene. Why are you doing this?! [JUNG-SU GROANING] Piss off before you get hurt more. [JUNG-SU MUMBLES AND COUGHS] Jung-su! Jung-su! Are you okay? Get up. Are you hurt? Let me see you. Oh, my, are you okay? Jung-in... We've received the prosecution's new evidence submission. Please elaborate. In the credit card statement, rice wine was purchased at multiple shops. It was purchased up to three days before the incident. The defendant's husband enjoyed rice wines. Her husband's condition was so bad that he was sent home from the hospital. Ergo, the defendant estimated when her husband would die, and she planned to murder those who alienated and shunned him over the period. Look at the defendant's condition! Does she look like someone who can plan a murder? She was also said to be close with one of the victims, Mr. Hwang. There is no murder motive. SHIN: Then how can an ailing man like him keep drinking all on his own? These photos are from an unverified source. The one who took these photos is present here. He lived with the defendant for more than 20 years. We request the defendant Ahn Jung-su as our next witness. Hello! I'm Ahn Jung-su! [CROWD LAUGHS] We request a motion to reject him as a witness! The said witness suffers from severe autism. He's not fit to testify as he possesses the intelligence of a 10-year-old. He is a crucial witness. There are precedents for autistic witnesses in the past. CHAE [ON VIDEO]: Mayor Chu, welcome. It's heavy. Jung-su. Is this when Mom got sick? Constitution Day? Did this man come by often? You've been well? Oh. He's bad man! Mom was very, very sick! He's bad man, call police! Call police at 911. When you take the stand, you'll swear an oath. Say it after me. When you take the stand, you'll swear an oath. Say it after me. No, from now. No, from now. I solemnly swear that I'll tell the truth, the whole truth. I solemnly swear that I'll tell the truth, the whole truth. And nothing but the truth under penalties of perjury. And nothing but the truth under penalties of perjury! Jung-in, what's perjury? It means if you lie, you'll be punished bigtime. I'll ask you some questions, so answer. Was your father's condition serious? Yes! Very good. He was very sick! [JUNG-SU TITTERS] He drank even though he was sick? Yes. Who gave him rice wine? Mom? Yup. I wasn't allowed to go into his room, I could get sick! Or Mom beats me. [♪♪♪] Jung-in, is it your fault that I'm dumb? That's what Dad always said! He said you made me an idiot. [OBJECTS CLATTERING] [CRYING] What are you going to do about it now? You made my only son into a cripple, bitch! Didn't you hear the doctor? He was born like that! TAE-SU: How dare you interrupt me! Don't you dare stop me! Mom said it was her fault! Dad said your fault, Mom said her fault! Dad said your fault, Mom said her fault! Jung-su, it's nothing like that. But why aren't you home? Was it Jung-su's fault? So Jung-su was sad, S-A-D, very sad. When you're sad, you get tears, T-E-A-R-S. Does it hurt? Jung-su, do you have any other clothes? Jung-su. When you take the stand, make sure to look at me. When I shake, say "I don't know," and when I nod, say "That's right." - Understand? - Okay! SHIN: This is the security footage from the day of the incident. No one else poured rice wine except the witness. Let me ask you, did anyone else pour rice wine in the pot other than yourself? Please answer, was it just you? I dunno. You could be punished severely for perjury! Were you the only one? I don't know! [♪♪♪] So you are the only one who poured rice wine. Yes! Say it loudly, it was only you? Yes, only you! Allow me to ask you again, you're absolutely sure you were the only one? Me... Jung-su... I don't know! Mom, Mom, Mom! He doesn't know anything! I did it, it was me! I killed everyone! The defendant is making a false confession! She is only trying to protect her autistic child! I did it, my son doesn't know anything! JUNG-IN: Constitution Chapter 11, Article 6, Criminal Code 310, confession alone cannot establish one's guilt! - Mom! - Jung-su! - Jung-su! - Mom! Mom! Honey! WANG-YONG: Mrs. Chae! Someone call 911! Get an ambulance! [CROWD CLAMORING] Make way! [SIREN WAILING] JUNG-SU: Sister! Sister! WANG-YONG: What are you doing? Jung-su! Why you do this?! Jung-su! What are you doing? You don't have a warrant! We're arresting Ahn Jung-su, who confessed to the crime. Your mother's condition and her circumstances are bad. We can end this with a 10-year sentence. More people have died by tongue than knife. Use your tongue properly as a prosecutor! I could sue you for cajoling a lawyer. This case won't be easy. Proving the innocence of an obvious murderer. Just watch me, I'll prove her innocence.

MAN 1: It was raining, so I was there to get out of the rain. Couldn't you get me a lawyer? Good day, everyone. The case has been handed off to the prosecution so we'll take over. It's an unrelated case, why is the prosecution involved? It happened at the defendant's home during the trial, so we're taking over. [SCOFFS] You ignored requests for additional investigation, but now this? As he said, the suspect was at the defendant's home. They should investigate-- What are you talking about? - Get to it!

Indeed, from the casino to your campaign, you must be busy. What casino? Didn't that land have greenbelt status? It's nothing. I'm sorry that this happened at my home. No need to apologize. Did you meet my dad often when he was alive? Mr. Ahn Tae-su? I was busy with town work, so not too often. How's your mother? She's not well. Yeah? Aging is hard. The older you get, the harder it is for the children. Mmm. Could you actually be our witness? Witness? Sure, it's no trouble. But since I'm not well, let's do it later. Hmm. I knew you'd say that. What do you mean? You knew what? My doctor won't let me leave. -I hope you recover quickly. -Mm. See you again. Sure thing. Off you go. [DOOR OPENS THEN CLOSES] Oh. I found the security footage. The truck belongs to Mr. Bang's construction company. I knew it. What about Mayor Chu? Did he agree to be a witness? No. I'll have to force him. They're far more cunning than I thought. Just say what I heard and saw? MAN: Please rise. The judges are entering the court. JUNG-IN: The pesticide found at the defendant's house was purchased from Mr. Jeon's shop. Five years ago, he did tenant farming on the village mayor's land. He took them on credit. Did you know the defendant's family well? They're my ex's family. When he was shunned by the entire village, I became his drinking buddy even though I don't drink. What did you two talk about over drinks? The times when he was doing well, but it always ended with badmouthing others. What happened? Mr. Ahn Tae-su... was a big shot when he headed the quarry. [♪♪♪] There aren't useful rocks here anymore. Is that true? Speaking of which, I got a killer tip. You know the mountain in the next village over? Gold was found there. [EXPLOSION IN DISTANCE] JEON: He believed a geologist and bought up the land by pooling the villagers' money. How much longer are we gonna keep digging? Huh? You sure there's gold in there? JEON: After the gold digging scam, he was after one last comeback. Sir, could you pass the nomination to me? JEON: He wanted to use all his connections to get into politics. - How much more will you scam us? - Let him go. Nomination Forfeit Agreement CHU: You should've done this earlier. Why get beat up for it? JEON: Everyone in the village shunned him. Chu, Hwang and others stood by Mr. Ahn until the end. But they planned a betrayal. Where's Chu In-hwe?! Where is that bastard?! You son of a bitch! You're campaigning instead of me?! People here want me to, what choice do I have? Son of a bitch! You bastard! MAN: Must be hurt. CHU: Am I wrong? Stop it before you look even more pathetic. [IN ENGLISH] Game over. I'll kill you all with pesticide! Wait a minute, kill them with pesticide? Yes, he always said that. JUNG-IN: Chu, Hwang, Ji, Bang and Choi, these are all victims of spiked rice wine at Mr. Ahn's funeral, right? JEON: Looks like it. People in this village all quit drinking for their health. They were the only drinkers in the village. Did the defendant and Mr. Ahn Tae-su know this? Of course, even I knew that. Eh? They always hung out and drank together. Your Honor, we request one of the survivors of this case, Mayor Chu In-hwe, appear as our witness. [IN KOREAN] You made things worse by not killing that bitch! Look at this approval rating. Approval rating is one thing, but the public opinion is bad. Don't talk back to me! [♪♪♪] I should've tossed her in a mental hospital long ago. CHAE: Chu In-hwe, you bastard! Where is he?! I know, you're the same as Ahn Tae-su! Come to the police station, let's go right now! What the hell did I do, woman?! I know exactly what you did! Everything's going to shit, I'll have to set this right. So many of you came, good day! WOMAN 1: How do you know the defendant? MAN: What is your current condition? WOMAN 2: Do you have anything to say to the citizens of Daecheon? [ALL CLAMORING] Do you know 2004 Daecheon Councillor Yoo Young-dae? Yoo Young-dae? I'm not sure. According to Mr. Jeon, you assaulted Yoo and obtained his nomination forfeit agreement. Jeon said that? Why did he talk all that nonsense? The assaulters usually don't remember but the victims do. Who's the victim? Bring him here. Mr. Ahn Tae-su threatened the former councilman Councillor Yoo, and you were said to have assaulted him during the nominations. So bring the victim. The defense is making speculations based on nothing but hearsay. Allow me to make this absolutely clear to you. I received my nomination fairly and entered the election. Witness, is your wife's name Lee Soon-ja? CHU: Yes, that's correct. [♪♪♪] This is Mr. Ahn's bankbook. Your wife received $30,000 six months ago, and $10,000 three months ago, could you explain that? I was told that she lent him $30,000 for his liver transplant, and he asked for an additional $10,000. Is there an IOU? My wife lent it to him on good faith, so I'm not sure. Of course there isn't, because Mr. Ahn threatened you. Threatened? Lady, do I look like someone who'd get threatened? Wasn't that to make up the loss from selling his land? Jesus, what are you talking about? As soon as Mr. Ahn's land was sold, its greenbelt status was removed, and casino construction plans were revealed and someone profited. Who gave consent for the casino to get built on greenbelt land? Whether someone profits or not, what's that got to do with me? Huh? Did I own even 1 percent of that greenbelt land? How did I profit from this casino?! Witness, do not raise your voice. Wang-yong: I've arrived I'd like to request a new witness. SHIN: We'd like to object. He's an unscheduled witness. He's a key witness who invaded the defendant's home. He may be in danger so we request a closed hearing. The defense's request for a closed hearing is approved. Please clear the courtroom. We'll announce the next hearing separately. Why did you even bring a sick man here? You broke into Mrs. Chae's home, no? Did you do it on your own or did someone order you? Mr. Bang ordered me to. Bang is head of the construction company where the witness works. For what reason? He said it was Mayor Chu's order. I was told to bring back Ahn Tae-su's old land certificate. Are these the documents you were looking for? Yes, that's right. I kept a copy just in case Mayor Chu changed his mind. What do you mean? He promised me a spot when the casino-- I shouldn't have said that. In the convenience store when the casino opens, but I didn't take the offer. During the prosecution's investigation, did you mention this document? Yes, of course. But they shrugged it off and told me to leave. Who was the prosecutor? Him. JUNG-IN: That is all. MAN: Daecheon Mayor Chu, leading candidate for governor, was in court today... I managed to find the part, it's as good as new. Forty-two dollars, please. Thank you. Find irrefutable, consistent evidence! If it's consistent enough, it'll become the truth. The truth can be a lie with a small crack! [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Sir, what should we do with Ahn Jung-su? Attorney Ahn is waiting outside. ♪ Happy birthday Happy birthday to you! ♪ ♪ Happy birthday dear Ahn Jung-su! ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to... ♪♪ [CELL PHONE BEEPING] TAE-SU [ON PHONE]: Whenever I eat my wife's food, my chest hurts and I can't breathe. [♪♪♪] [COUGHING] Because of Choon-woo, she's gone crazy, she's trying to kill me. Jung-su. Who broke this phone? Was it Mom? Why did she break it? I don't know. Mom scares me. Why did you cremate Ahn Tae-su? His body won't rot, so I wanted him burned. He deserves to be burned. JUNG-IN: Do you remember these men? Bastards. They're the same as Ahn Tae-su! Goddamn trash! Why? Did they kill someone? You reported to the police that your husband killed someone. CHU: Thirty thousand dollars isn't enough? TAE-SU: It's not that. CHU: Mm. TAE-SU: Choon-woo keeps showing up in my dreams lately. The statute of limitations has all but passed. You killed him, I didn't do shit! We all did it together. CHU: Huh? - What did you do to Choon-woo?! What did you do to him?! HWANG: What's the matter?! Tell me! Say it again! [SHOUTING] Knowing what he did, Ahn deserved to die! Because of Choon-woo, she's gone crazy, she's trying to kill me. What the hell are you doing?! [JUNG-SU WHIMPERS] [♪♪♪] CHAE: For the table over there. [GASPS] JUNG-IN: Choon-woo, all this was because of Lim Choon-woo? Sleep a little more, I'll be back shortly. Hm? CHAE: He had a good heart. It tears me up just thinking about it. [♪♪♪] [MUFFLED GRUNTING] [SOBBING] [COUGHING] Why did you do that?! What about the baby?! If I keep my mouth shut, no one will know! I'll raise her as my own, I give you my word, so live with me! JUNG-IN: You lived with Ahn Tae-su because of Choon-woo's daughter? CHAE: I was scared because I had nothing. I had no family. I had nobody to look after me. So scared of leaving for somewhere. But I wanted to save my daughter. My baby, Jung-in... Jung-in... But I didn't get to protect her. I just couldn't. Imagine her pain that led her to slit her wrist. I pretended not to know until then. I'm the bitch, I deserve to die. A child just needs her mother in the toughest of times. But I couldn't protect my own child. I didn't recognize my child's pain. I'm the bitch, I deserve to die. I couldn't protect her... Jung-in! Jung-in! [♪♪♪] [JUNG-IN SOBBING] [♪♪♪] My daughter... Jung-in. Mom. Why are you crying? I'm sorry. Jung-in... I'm sorry. Mom... I'm sorry that I left without you. I'm so sorry. Baby, are you all right? Where am I? What happened to me? I don't know how this happened or where we are. What do I do? What am I to do? Don't cry, baby. If you're all right, then I am too. Don't worry about me and look after yourself. I'm so lost, Mom. What do I do? Mom, what do I do? Tell me what to do. What do I do, Mom? Tell me... [♪♪♪] JUNG-IN: What was the witness looking for at the defendant's home? Or was he trying to destroy something? You can see the names of the owners as of 2018. This land used to belong to the defendant's husband Ahn Tae-su. But to pay for his liver cirrhosis treatment, he sold it to Bang and Ji in 2016 at a bargain price. Then the witness removed its greenbelt status, and with the casino moving in, the land value shot up. Your Honor, the defense is continuing her irrelevant line of questioning. [CHU CHUCKLES] Lady, you got a memory problem, or do you not have a point? My name is not mentioned on that map at all. If there's even a slight conflict of interest, I'll take full responsibility as the mayor. [CROWD MURMURING] Will you swear by it? I absolutely will. Everything I did was for the love of Daecheon. [♪♪♪] If that's a crime, I'll take the punishment. You're right. The witness has not profited from the casino deal. I discovered that there is irrefutable evidence from this 1998 map that Ahn kept until his death. Lee Soon-yim, Lee Soon-bok, Lee Chang-seok, Lee Dong-seok. Witness, do you know them? They're your wife's family members. How much did you invest in the gold mine in the past? What? Well, that's... JUNG-IN: You won't remember. Because the gold mine never existed. [CROWD MURMURING] The geologist who spread rumors of a gold mine was your wife's cousin, and your wife's family made an incredible fortune by selling useless land to Ahn Tae-su and the villagers. Certified ownership transfer register 1998->2016->2018 Could you still say that you have not profited from this land? Didn't Ji, Bang and DL Construction give you election funds on the condition of the casino permit? You son of a bitch! MAN 1: Chu In-hwe, you bastard! [ALL CLAMORING] WOMAN: How dare you! MAN 2: You'll be punished! JUDGE: Silence! Lady, what kind of novel are you writing here? I'm the victim. I was poisoned and almost died at your father's damn funeral! Witness, mind your manners in the courtroom. Jung-in! Are you kidding with me? Huh? That happened 20 years ago! How dare you... You brought out a sick man for this?! [POUNDING ON TABLE] I'm looking for a murder suspect. Lim Choon-woo, don't you remember? The actual murderer is Tae-su Ahn, the defendant's husband. [♪♪♪] The deceased Ahn Tae-su? [CROWD MURMURING] JUNG-IN: Yes, that's right. After the gold mine scam, Ahn was in living hell. But when he found out that it was part of Mayor Chu's scheme, he soon lost his life to liver cirrhosis. And he put pesticide in the rice wine before death. As expected, Chu, Hwang, Ji, Bang and Choi drank it, and three are dead, and two are hospitalized. We'd like to add Ahn Tae-su as the prime suspect of this case. He expected his own death, and planned to kill people at his own funeral? This is a preposterous and delusional story! This is an analysis report from the forensics. Methomyl, which was found on the defendant's clothes, was also found on Ahn Tae-su's clothes. We'll rule on the validity of the evidence at the final hearing. MAN 1: Are the accusations uncovered in the trial true? WOMAN: Tell us the truth! MAN 1: Is Councillor Yoo complicit in this? MAN 2: One comment please! MAN 3: What is the truth? Tell us the truth! [ALL CLAMORING] Bang, you're under arrest for perjury and conspiracy to commit murder. MAN [ON TV]: Mayor Chu's bid for governorship is on shaky ground as... What are you doing? Stop that. The police are looking into any illegal election contributions. Mayor Chu may not run for governor. Jung-su, could I ask you a favor? Dad asked me to give it to them, as a present. The rice wine pot was the present? When Dad's in heaven, there'd be a party. He said to give it to the man on TV. Is this the man on TV? Yes! [CROWD MURMURING] This man bad, very bad! That is all. JUDGE: We'll now hear from the defendant. Defendant, where are we? I don't know. Where is this? Who am I? I don't know. I'll ask again, who am I? I don't know. But you sure are pretty. I've got a daughter like you. She went to Seoul National University Law. She's pretty. Her name is Ahn Jung-in. [♪♪♪] I haven't seen her in so long. I feel bad because I couldn't do anything for her. I wonder if she's eating well, if she's sick, if she's got a boyfriend. I miss her so much. I'll ask you again, [VOICE BREAKING] who am I? I really don't know. I'm sorry. [SNIFFLES] [IN NORMAL VOICE] The defendant beside me is my mother. But she doesn't even recognize her daughter. She dedicated her life to her family and ended up with dementia. For this reason, she can be excessively emotional and prone to arguments. But it is not fair to assume that her arguments led her to plan and execute murders. To be innocent, there can't be any reasonable doubt. All the evidence presented by the prosecution was circumstantial, leaving room for reasonable doubt. But the defendant's husband Ahn Tae-su is different. He had a clear motive and his own son witnessed it. The defense insists on Chae Hwa-ja's innocence, and declares that Ahn Tae-su is the prime suspect. [ALL MURMURING] I'll now read the verdict of case 2017-363. To obtain a conviction in a criminal trial, there has to be irrefutable evidence, but all evidence presented against the defendant was circumstantial. In addition, new evidence presented by the defense concerning Ahn Tae-su has to be verified by the prosecution in the future. Verdict is as follows: Defendant Chae Hwa-ja is not guilty. [ALL CHATTERING] Are you certain Ahn Tae-su is the perpetrator? How do you feel about winning this trial? Let me ask you something. Do you really think your mother is innocent? She has already been punished. JUNG-SU: Jung-in! ♪ Sitting in the flower bed ♪ ♪ Watching the petals ♪ ♪ Where did this pretty color ♪ ♪ Come from? ♪ ♪ Such a beautiful flower ♪ ♪ Flower ♪ ♪ Such a great day ♪ ♪ What a great day ♪♪ Mom, is that the only song you know?
