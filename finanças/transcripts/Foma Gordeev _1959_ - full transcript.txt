Ignat Matveevich! Ignat Matveevich! Ignat Matveevich! But just see how the Volga is working! She can rend the whole earth apart. One more time! Look, look! There goes my barge! Ignat Matveevich! Ignat Matveevich! You're to blame. O Lord... O Lord... Glory to Thee, oh Lord! Thou hast not willed, it appears that my race should die out! My sins will not be left without justification in Thy sight. He will pray away my sins. I thank Thee, oh Lord! Hey! Send someone to St. Nicholas' Church for the priest! Say that Ignatiy Matvyeevitch has got a son Gentlemen of the merchant class! I raise my brimming beaker for Ignat Matveevich, the parent of the newborn successor of our class, Foma his name. Hurrah! Long live the child! How are you, Natalya? I shall not survive it. Oh Lord! How could it be? Consider, he cannot get on without you. For he needs the mother's breast. Take courage! Drive away the thought! Drive it away... For the little baby... Forgive me... farewell! Be careful — see that you don't drink. Kum, Foma's lost his mother. Kum, he needs breast feeding. Kum, my wife is feeding Luba. She can feed both of them, Foma will grow together with Lubava. So summer will pass, and autumn will pass. Autumn will pass, winter will arrive, and then again summer, again winter... Preserve the child from all evil, from every cruel thing, from every storm, from evil spirits, of the day and of the night. And a man is appointed to organize life on the earth. In proportion as he circulates in life, and absorbs tallow and oil, sweat and tears, mind and soul are created in him. And from that time forth he begins to grow, both upward and downward. Eat, Foma, absorb tallow and oil, and mind and soul will be crated in you, Foma. Eat, Foma. Grow up, Foma. Why are you such a shy fellow? Why don't you laugh more? Enough of it, I didn't beget a son for your benefit. It is not cheerful for me without him. My house is empty. I'll take him. Fomka! What do you want? Speak! Presents? Toys? Come, ask me! There's nothing in the world that I will not buy I have a million! Do you understand? All is yours. Do you like it? Yes? Take it, all is yours. Take it. Hey, Fomka, wait a bit. In spring we'll inaugurate a big steamer a real one, and will float down the Volga river! Fomka! Enough! You're not loading a horse! And do you hold your tongue. You're yoked, so don't kick over the traces. And if he does suck the blood out of you Still, hold your tongue. Daddy! What? Do you suck blood? Who said that? He. He says I'm using too much oil. Greedy like a devil. Greedy... Look, our employer. Who sucks blood? And ain't I right? Aren't you going to suck it? Give it to me. Why do you frown? You are very strong. I? Well, God has not been unkind to me on that score. Wha-at a crack you hit him a while ago! You mean Pashka? Yes, you brought blood. Are you sorry for him? Sorry! There's no occasion for pitying him. He got what he deserved. And you keep away from them. They're not fit companions for you. You are their master, they are your servants. When we finish, we can fling every man of them ashore. They are as plentiful everywhere as dogs with undipped tails. Take it. Little you are, can't understand my words. I must teach you how to live. Ekh, Fomka... My dear little son, my joy, Learn, learn well while I am alive. Whose son are you? Gordeev's. And you? Smolin African. And I'm Ezhoff, if you like, I will always prompt you? The teacher doesn't punish the rich boys. But I'm a poor hanger-on, I have to study hard. For what? Poor fellows have to study a lot, so that they may become doctors, or officials. And what are you going to be? I don't know. Tisn't necessary for you to be anything. Eh, you little patty-boxes! Hand chow-down over, and I will help you for that. Sit down. Hand it over. Eh, what good things you do have to eat! Patties with green onions! I'm awfully fond of them! Hey you, karamora, show what you have. You're a beggar, a pauper! All right, go ahead! I won't prompt you any more and you'll be as dumb as a rock! Why are you abusing each other? Look! Look! Is the owl completely blind by day? Yes. Some men just like the owl - They thrash about in life, search for their place, struggle, and struggle, only the feathers fly off them, and the accomplish nothing. Eh, woe to such men, woe! Life is such thing that as soon as you walk unsteadily, it will yell at you with a thousand voices, and will beat you, and knock you off your feet. O Lord, forgive my sins. A man, my dear fellow, is just like the pilot on a ship. In youth and in flood-tide, go straight ahead! Come on, Ignatich! 54 kopeikas! Our burdock is going to blossom into a scarlet poppy! I can't understand him! I feel something strange in him. He's a handsome girl, and not a young man at all! Now, there's Afrikan Smolin, who's two years older - and just see what he is! Pitch him, head over heels into some urgent business or other! Gold is tried by fire. - Just wait... - Why wait? He'll circulate on the Volga for two or three years, and then will marry. There's my Liuboff, a fine girl. Hello, Liuboff! Foma, what a good thing that you have come! What's the matter with you? Ah, Foma! What a book I have been reading! It seems as though doors flew open into some other realm. The whole life is different. They're inventions, delusions. You are mistaken! You have never read books. Drop it... you'll get no good out of your books! There's your father - he doesn't read books, but isn't he a clever one! And you'll be just such another skinflint. Ah! My children, my dark-blue doves! What were you cooing about chiefly? Oh, various trifles. Who asked you? Hold your tongue. Go and prepare us some refreshments. I'll teach you, Foma. I'll instruct you in the real, genuine science and philosophy. If you understand it, You will live without making mistakes. Life, my dear Foma, is very simply regulated. Bite everybody, or lie in the mud. Every mortal affair has two faces, Foma. One, which is visible to everyone, that's the false one, and the other concealed, which is the real one. In the person of the merchant class we see our brothers in Christ. This feast was organised by our brother Ignat on the occasion of prosperity in trading and building a shelter for orphans and dispossessed people. Let's turn to the Almighty with our thoughts. Enjoy your meal! Music! Play! Son'ka Medinskaya, wife of the architect. Sofya Pavlovna This is her husband. He's strong for eating. Sofya Pavlovna? Hello. Please. Are you still collecting contributions from us poor people, Sofya Pavlovna? Haven't I a fine son? He's not bad. In favour of the poor! I am deeply grateful to you! Here's your souvenir. A charming dog. To hold in arms this creature is allowed only for the happy chosen one of it's owner. If you throw much money - you will go bankrupt. Pretty little woman, isn't she? You'll gape at her and she'll devour your whole insides. She is sticking fast to your father. She has enticed seventy-five thousand rubles out of his pocket. Has my father made her his mistress? God, you are out of your mind! To get up a mistress at the age of sixty-three and at such a price. We merchants, we trading people, have carried Russia on our shoulders for centuries, and are still carrying her! For Russian merchants! Hurrah! Quick hands you have, Ignat. Snatched wheat from under my nose! Of course, I cheat you, you cheat me. Put no trust in people, do not expect much from them. We all live for the purpose of taking, not of giving. Gentlemen of the merchant class! To the health of Sofya Pavlovna! Music, play! So you began? And then you'll bow all the time, and keep a fast, eh? Oh, the old raven! In his eyes, my money and his own are the same thing. He has an object. He wants to unite the money. I will not marry Luba. But why? I don't like her. Pray tell me, sir, what sort are most to your taste? The very simple ones. She's there with the students and her books She will laugh at me. She's clever and religious, everything is in Liuboff. Anyway, I'll not marry her. And why you stare too much at Sofya Pavlovna? She's like birch-wood coals. They seem to be cold, but if you take them in your hand, they burn. Vodka is bad for you. Who are you talking to? To your father?! See here, I'll squeeze so that the tears will burst out of your heels. You've run up rapidly! Go away. Go away. Your Honor! Let's make a carousel! Guys, let's make a carousel! How much have you given in favour of the poor?! I gave a thousand! I gave five thousand! And I gave seventy five! To the health of Sofya Pavlovna! Hurrah! To the health of Sofya Pavlovna! If you don't sin you can't repent, and if you don't repent, you can't save your soul. You mustn't break down today like a weakling. See what a crowd of people. Seventy-five thousand rubles — 'tis a sum for which one has a right to demand so many mourners. Look, here's Sofya Pavlovna, the benefactrix. You're the leader of an army in battle, now. Аnd you must command your soldiers bravely. And your soldiers are rubles. Stand proud, for the esteem should descend to the heir. Esteem is the same as money. As it said in Solomon's sayings: "Wealth attracts many friends". Drink, you feel relieved. Be more affable, more talkative Why are they gobbling here? Have they come to an eating-house? Pray come to the table! I'm not going to eat. It's his grief, you know. Ignat was father and mother both to him. Please sit down! The pancakes will be served immediately. Please, sit down. Foma, You know, you're as unlike a merchant as possible. And you're very unlike a merchant's wife Thank heaven! Why are you glad? That we are not like our parents. To the founder of the house, eternal memory! Now we lay the foundation of a lodging-house, a shelter for orphans and the dispossessed ones, that'll be built on 75000 rubles, given by Ignat Matveevitch Gordeev. I watched your face on the day of the funeral, and my heart ached. 'Heavens,' I said to myself, 'how he must be suffering!' I am deeply grateful to you! My poor boy! Can I address you thus? I am quite an old woman. You? Am I not? Don't you believe that I am an old woman? I do believe you, only, that is not true! What you mean? That you believe me? No! not that, but that I... You... Forgive me! I do not know how to express myself! There's no need to feel troubled over that. They are men who have pure hearts, who are confiding, sincere as children, and aren't you one of those people? I am deeply grateful to you! Perhaps, some day, you will just drop in? I... thank you! Why are you, immortal old man, everywhere with your umbrella? Your Excellency, the umbrella protects me not only from rain and sun but also from evil eye. Be careful, Foma. She'll turn your head. What things I know about her! You lie. Lie! How repulsive everything is. I want to talk with a man, and there's not a man about. There's not a living soul about. Since my mother's death, my father has chased everyone away. I'm disgusted. Disgusted... What live for? What's the matter with you? How I wish that everything should disgust you and that you should be disgusting to yourself! You simply are... a goose. You haven't been inside my soul. And there are men who never sparing themselves, they toil and suffer and perish! Ezhoff was excluded from university for that. They do want something? Happiness for all men! Well, I don't understand that. Foma, you ought to wish to be better. Well, and don't I wish that? Here, now you know that there's a building named after Ignat Gordeeff. God rest his soul. Depart from evil and prepare us some refreshments. Consider, Foma, what are they for - those night lodging-houses and other institutions of that sort? For what? What is there to consider? For the beggars. But what is a beggar? A beggar is a man who is forced, by fate to remind us of Christ, he is the bell of the Lord, and rings in life for the purpose of awakening our conscience. But men have so ordered their lives That it is utterly impossible to act in accordance with Christ's teaching. And Jesus Christ has become entirely superfluous for us, God forgive me. Not once but, in all probability, a thousand times, we have given Him over to be crucified, but still we cannot banish Him from our lives, so long as His poor brethren sing His Name in the streets, And so now we have hit on the idea of shutting up the beggars in such special buildings, so that they may not roam about the streets and stir up our consciences. Forgive me, O Lord! So then, god-son! Investigate! That's cle-ever! Ecclesiastes said that a crooked thing one is not able to make straight. and one can't count something that doesn't exist. Time goes, time comes. But the relation of the honorary chairman to our patroness has become such, that should have become. He's in love. How are you, Sofya Pavlovna? Let's go, I'm tired of all those men. Save, God, your servant, Foma in the name, from tortures of our patroness. They will walk for long, and will return late. Do you love me? How many times have you asked that? I need to know. You are playing with me. How am I playing with you? What does the word mean? I love you! I love you! Is it possible not to love you? But you want only that. There, you have said it! Would you like to kiss my hand? Recruited. Go away, my dear one, I am weary and wish to rest. Sofya Pavlovna! Sofya Pavlovna! Dear! Wait, wait. Good bye, my friend, don't forget me. I'm always glad to see you. You are so good. I am deeply grateful to you! Foma! Foma! What? You go to see Son'ka very often indeed. What business have you to call her Sonka? As for calling her Son'ka - everybody knows about that. What does she represent? An insect for the adornment of Nature and nothing else! Enough. Wait, why are you so irritated? Come here. Who else except myself will warn you? Come here. Do you often make gifts to her? What gifts? Why? Do you mean to say that she lives with you simply for love? You're an old man, but it's shameful to listen to you! Well, and man is stupid in his youth! Fie on you! Has she been leading you by the nose all winter? Ah, whore of Babylon! For Christ's sake, don't say that! Well, the thing is clear. Go to Son'ka if you can't get along without it. And tell her plainly: "I want to be your lover, don't charge much". Who's there? It is I. I'm glad to see you, sit down! Why haven't you been for such a long while? What's the matter with you, my good one? And if I am good, then things ought to go well with me! And the good always have a worse time on the earth than the bad! Bless, O Lord! Sofya Pavlovna! Make an end of it! This is what I came here to say to you: Enough! You must deal with me in a straightforward manner, openly. I see you do understand with what object I have come to you. Oh, cease. I will not! I will speak! I know all about you! All! Yes? So much the better for me. So you have learned all and you have condemned me? I would like to be your sister. And you look at me in such an unfriendly way. Do you believe me? Yes? No... I don't know. I did believe. But now? But now it is better that I should go away! I understand nothing, And I don't understand myself. Understand me, I am sorry for you! Sorry? I don't want that. You have not treated me well, you allure a man. Am I your plaything? All I wanted was to see you near me. Oh, you! God gave you angelic beauty, but where is your heart? Farewell! Farewell! Perhaps I have said something which offends you, Forgive me! But, you see, I love you. No, you have not offended me. Go, and God be with you. Well then, farewell! Yes. Yes, Foma Ignatievitch disappeared. He hasn't been here for a year. He's mourning. Yes. How are you, my modest millionaire! Where've you been for so long? Do you know, Foma Ignatievitch, Our incomparable patroness is going abroad to be gone all summer. - Sofya Pavlovna? - Yes. Foma Ignatievitch, my dear, How are you? Have you heard of Sofya Pavlovna? The sun of my life will set. And, perhaps, the sun of your life also? Medinskaya goes? Splendid! I'm delighted! There'll be one cocotte less in town. Sir Knyazeff... How do you know that she is a coquette? I didn't say a coquette. I said cocotte. But if you do not understand it, I can explain. Yes, you certainly will explain. Gentlemen! Gentlemen! A cocotte, if you care to know is a venal woman. Don't revile behind a person's back but rail straight to his face! Come away! My dear fellow, for God's sake! Wait till I give him a kick. Come away, come away, my dear fellow. Music, continue! You can't! You can't! Oh, you scoundrel! I have children! Everyone knows me! Rascal! Savage! Duel! Listen! Excuse me, but it was savage! Deuce take it, 'tis the first time I have ever seen such a thing. The dear man! Wasn't he worth the trouncing? Of course, he does. He's a scamp and a sharper. But, bearing in mind that the lady, in whose defence you came forward... Sir, you must not say anything bad about her to me. She is dear to me. But it wasn't for her sake that you beat him? For whom, then? Oh Lord! Sofya Pavlovna's going away... Stop thinking about that little lady. She's poisonous food for you. No, hold on! What's the meaning of it? Am I worse than other men? I understand nothing, my dear fellow. One person says this, another that. And how to live? I thought, I should become a man by her side! Eh, my dear sir! This won't do! Life is given us for life, that's the philosophy! If you like, I'll make you acquainted with such a virulent specimen. Somewhat epic. I'm ashamed to. Why are you ashamed? Let's go, eh? All right, let's go! And when I get screwed up, I'll break loose, after all this — look out! Ai-ai-ai, he sent barge to the bottom. If the deceased Ignat could read in the, newspapers about his son's indecent life, he'd kill his Fomka! You see how he is described? He deserves it! That sharp fellow described Foma's behavior adroitly. We-ell now, Efimushka, I'll flay you alive. Where's the steamer, captain? I didn't do it! You didn't? The master himself. Fomka? And you... what were you doing? I was lying under the hatchway. A-a! You were lying. I was bound. Wha-at?! Permit me to tell you in proper order. Well? He didn't manage and sent the laden barge to the bottom. He has a very strong character. When he's sober, he's silent most of the time, and goes about thoughtfully, but when he wets his springs with liquor, - he gets wound up. Hold your tongue! Where is Foma? There, on the spot. They are going to raise the barge. Probably they have already begun. Is he alone there? He has a lady with him, a swarthy sort of... The woman doesn't seem to have quite all her wits. She's eternally singing. She sings very well, It's a great scandal. I'm not asking you about her! I'm going. Calm yourself, dear papa! Perhaps the loss is not great. Not great? What do you understand about it, you fool? Is it that the barge was smashed?! Ekh, you... A man's character was smashed! That's where the trouble lies! And, you see, I needed him! I needed him, you stupid devils! Well, wait, dear god-son. I'll cover you. I'll cover you. I dreamed that I was singing a solo, and opposite me stood a great big dirty dog, and I knew that it would devour me as soon as I stopped singing. So I kept on singing, and singing. What does it portend? Stop your jabber! See here, tell me, what do you know about me? Why, I know that you have waked up. What sort of a man am I, in your opinion? A drunken man... Don't trifle! Tell me, conscientiously, what do you think of me? You're better than the others. And how am I better? Why - in this way! When a fine song is sung, you weep, if a man does a mean thing, you thrash him. With women you are simple. And you can be audacious, on occasion. You're not telling me the right thing. Well, I don't know what you want. They're raising the barge... What shall we do? I'm not going to get drunk any more! Nonsense! What do you think about it? Is it well to live so? What is better? A cockroach crawls, but he knows where he wants to go and why. But how about you? Where are you going? Stop! What have you to do with me? You take from me what you want, but don't you try to creep into my soul! Soul! Can an individual who has a soul live as you live? In the soul fire burns, it feels shame. What are you looking at? Eekh, you...! But what am I? Don't you dare to speak about my soul. You have nothing to do with it! It's nothing that I'm a woman of gay habits! A man in the mire may lives more cleanly than he who strolls about in silks. You ought to know what malice I cherish against life. Ekh, you... And I feel the same. Something is springing up in my soul. Ekh, I will express myself in my own words when the time comes. Against whom? Against everyone! Against falsehood. I'll ask! Ask whether the samovar is ready? Go to the devil! Go to the steamer! We'll lift the barge and go to Kazan. Hey, come here. Why are you so happy? Work's pleasant, to anyone who likes it. It's regular play. It's like fondling a woman. And you know me, Foma Ignatievitch. Don't you remember? We have prepared everything, Foma Ignatievitch, everything is in good shape now. We'd better ask a blessing and begin. Well, begin. Bless, O Lord! O, all-holy Birth-Giver of God and Saint Nicholas. Gi-i-i-Ive wa-a-ay! Gi-i-Ive wa-ay! Heave-ho! He-eave a-awa-ay, heave away, heave! I congratulate you on a successful ending, Foma Ignatievitch! Glory to Thee, O Lord! I think you must be tired? I'm not tired. Get out! Get out! There's forest spirit! Go to the hold, maybe there's a woman. 2,8 millions kilograms, like a radish from a garden-bed! Your Honor! Are we to have the liquor, hey? Your Honor!.. Will you give us for a bucket? All you want is to get drunk! You ought to reflect, why? You ought to understand. It isn't our place to ponder over our work! Just so. You must do such work, so that men may say, a thousand years later: See, the Bogorodskoe peasants did that. Are we to drink the Volga dry? But even if we were to drink the Volga dry, and eat up yonder mountains to boot, even that would be forgotten, Foma Ignatievitch. It is not for us to do such deeds as stand out big above all the others. Here understanding is needed. Well... I make you a gift of three buckets of liquor! He's strange! What's the matter? I'm disgusted, Alexandra! I wish you'd do something with me, can't you? Ekh, you, baby! I don't want to live like that. How are you, dear god-son? Whither are you pleased to journey, Foma Ignatievitch? About my own business. Very laudable, my dear sir! And who is the lady with feathers? She's my mistress. I must have a talk with you. Will you come to the hotel with me? Yes, but not for long. Well, come along. And couldn't you drown that lady for the time being? Go to the town, Sasha, and engage a room. I'll be there before long! I'm ready! Why have you come hither? You've been behaving outrageously yonder. I want to see - how much. You're troubling yourself for nothing. Now, see here, papa. Either give me complete independence, or else take my entire business into your own hands. Take everything, and have done with it! But I shall be free to go where I please! I can't live on like this, I want to live in freedom. I will search out life for myself. Otherwise, what am I? A prisoner. Ekh, you have gone astray. And you are babbling nonsense. Papa! It has been done - men have abandoned all their possessions, they've gone away... Not in my time! Nobody whom I know intimately! I'd have shown them! Papa! Why won't you do it? Calves don't roar like bears! Don't talk drivel, don't try to climb where you have no business. You have millions. What fun in them? Is it possible that a man is born to accumulate money, beget children, and die? No, we must consider why we are living. There's no sense in our life. Ekh, you don't understand the power of money. Who does understand it? I! And so does every sensible man. Thousands of persons have staked their lives on your money. And you can fling all that money into the fire, and watch, how it burns. And you will regard yourself as the master. Through business the masses are fed, and you are the master over all those masses. A man craves power. And what, except money, gives power? Why do you play the fool? You want freedom! And all of you people of the present day will perish through freedom. The devil has laid hold of you. All right! You won't do it? Then there will be nothing! I'll get rid of everything! And we have nothing more to say to each other. Farewell! Do you know how I can deal with you? As you please! Here then. If I choose, I can go to town and have it arranged that you shall be declared crazy, and put in the lunatic asylum. Is it possible? Everything is possible with us, my dear fellow. I pledged my word to your father to set you on your feet. If you don't remain standing, I'll hoop you with iron. I'll cover you up from the head down! I'll put a bell-glass over you. It's an awkward thing to jest with me. So there is no alternative for me? You have an alternative - go ahead! But I will guide you. Why do you brag? What have you to brag about? Ekh, you manager of life! Come now, you're clever, you know everything. Tell me, why do you live? What have you done for life? By what are men going to remember you? Hold your tongue, puppy! I'll carouse and spend everything We'll see! You'll see what I'll do. Can't I have a drink of seltzer water? Hello! Hello. Don't you recognize me, Foma Ignatievitch? Ezhoff. Heavens! Is it really you? I myself, my dear fellow, can hardly believe it, but it's an actual fact. How old you have grown! Life has robbed you. I assume, from my troubled soul, that you also, my friend, do not find a jolly life very jolly, eh? What is my life like? Something outrageous. This is curious! For it proves that the holy spirit of dissatisfaction with life has made its way even into the bed-chambers of the merchant-class. Come, tell me, what one ought to do, in order to live calmly? So that one will be satisfied with himself? To that end, one must live uneasily, and avoid, like the plague, even the possibility of being satisfied with himself. Well, and dare you talk like that to men, to their faces? On every convenient occasion. And every Sunday, in the newspaper. No, this is not what is needed. If only... If only my fod-father could be set out against them. To show them up. They're a pretty mischievous sort of people I'll show you! Our hopes of Foma are poor. O Lord... Ain't I clever? Ain't I sharp? Dear papa! Do not grieve. And I'd better be quick about marrying you off. I've been casting my eyes on a fellow. He's not stupid, has been polished up abroad. Is it Smolin? And if it is he, what then? I don't know him. We'll introduce you, arrange a nice hearty little feast Set old silver on the table I want him to be impressed. Why that? Because a lass is not a horse, you can't get her off without the harness Foma, I can't stand it... Take me away... Let's get away from here. What a weak creature you are, brother. The song is good. You think I'm drunk? My body is drunk, but my soul is sober. My fate has wronged me! Why have I toiled for twelve years without a rest? In order to learn? So what? What faith have I won for myself? Only the belief that everything in this life is of no use even to the devil. Everything ought to be pulled down! Broken up! But I saw people who worked and sang. Interesting! If you are bored, then where are you going? What can you understand in songs? - I'm going. - I'm going too. Vassa, dress yourself. Stepan! Get things together! You beast! You! Don't touch him! What? Don't touch him! Stepan! Cut the connections. Your Honor, rafts will drift away... Hold your tongue! Cut, I want to serve my country, I want to purify the earth of worthless people. Cut! As you wish. Forgive me, O Lord. Music! Our guests depart! Your Honor, I'm not responsible. Have no fear. Hey, you! Farewell! Drowning! People drowning! Are you people?! I'm cold. Did I offend you? Don't be angry. No, I'm not angry. You'll disappear if don't do your business. My business is all fraud. My soul aches. How to live? You know, I'll go away. Where? I don't know. When my time comes, I shall grow sad and then I shall disappear. But it's early for me yet. Ah, and then, come what may. And I, also, shall disappear? Of course! All such people disappear. Farewell, Foma Ignatievitch! Sasha! Hello! What do you think of him? I venture to hope that you have not forgotten your old play-mate. I thank you for invitation. How goes life with you Liuboff Yakovlevna? She finds life with me very tiresome She's my housekeeper. The whole management lies on her, she doesn't have time to amuse herself And no place, either, you ought to add. I am not fond of merchants' balls and evening parties. But the theatre? I rarely go there. I have no one to go with. Theatre! Tell me, pray, why it has become so much the fashion to represent the merchant as a wild fool? It's very amusing, but it's incomprehensible, because it isn't true! Of course, if you are giving a historical play, for example, 'Life for the Tzar', with singing and dancing, or 'Hamlet', truth to nature is not required. The matter is past, and does not concern us. No matter whether it is true or not, so long as it's good. But if you're representing the present day, then don't lie! And show the man as he is! Why are you laughing? Isn't it true? You may go, for the present, Liubava, while he and I finish our little confab. Will you excuse me, Liuboff Yakovlevna? Pray do not stand on ceremony. Now, Afrian Mitritch, explain yourself Ah, Lubava, Lubava, father thinks that you are not capable of attracting the attention of a man, and deck you out with silver. For four years I diligently studied the position of Eussian leather in foreign markets. All these petty leather-producers cannot raise product to the proper degree of merit. So your present intention is to establish such a huge factory, that for all the others only a coffin and its cover? You've understood me. It will require about three hundred thousand. Father won't give that much as my dowry. My factory will turn out leather goods in the shape of trunks, shoes, harnesses, and... What per cent do you dream of making? I am not dreaming, I am reckoning I've drawn up a little record, founded upon my personal study of cattle-breeding and the consumption of meat in Russia. I see, upon personal return of cattle-breeding and the consumption of meat. He's like dear herald. It's an awkward thing to jest with me. Why don't you come, Foma? We are like family to you. Don't bristle up. Will you come to dinner? What dinner? Kononoff is going to inaugurate a new steamer, "Ilya Murometz". I haven't been invited. What are you saying? I promised to come with you. Partner of "Smolin and Mayakin" firm. Brothers, help, I can't live. Nothing suits me. If I perceive that everything is a fraud? We plug up the emptiness of our soul... Fomushka!

I'll introduce you to my friend, He's cleverer than we both. He's read Deuce knows how much good books. Travelled through half of Russia. Sit down. How are you? Hello, Foma Ignatievitch! Hello! Are you acquainted? Yes, for a long time. So 'Ilya Murometz' belongs to Kononov? Yes. It should have been called Nightingale the Robber. and his owner is a chieftain. No, chieftain is his immortal old man. Have you heard? The merchant class are pushing your god-father to the head of the city. He'll get his share of the cake. But you, you dry stump, are you gradually decaying? Well, I'm waiting, and then I'll say such words... You cannot liberate yourself with words. So, it's Kononoff's. Welcome. Hello! Hello!
