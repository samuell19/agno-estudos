(silence) (music) Hi there. Hi there, my name's Ted. Nice to meet ya. Hi there. My name's Ted. Nice to meet you. Hi there. My name's Ted. Nice to meet ya. Now the sociopath represents a different set of problems for the mental health worker. For the sociopath does not suffer from the sort of repressed impulses that the neurotic patient needs to examine and to recognize. He will lie, he will cheat, even kill to attain his ends. And not even the prospect of swift and sure punishment will deter him from his path to gratification. Four beers, please. Want to dance? Oh, I just got here. But thanks anyway. Come on. Dance with me. I won't bite, I promise. You won't regret it. are you a student? Uh, huh. Me too. Groovy Urn, thanks. Sure. I am so drunk I am hallucinating. Aw, hell. You again? Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Shit! Fuck! Fuck! (screaming) (laughing) This better be good, Ted. I just needed to hear your voice. It's four in the morning. I know, Lee. I've been hitting the books so hard I lost track of time. I haven't heard from you in nearly a week. I've been studying. Lee. I'm sorry. Yes, I know you've been studying. But, uh, God, I just ... I hate the way you make me feel sometimes. I need to see you. You only want to see me when it's convenient for you. Why can't you just be honest? You don't really love me. Not really. If you did, you would call. Lee, I just ... I just need to hold you. Then why don't you come over right now? I'll make you something to eat. How 'bout tomorrow, Lee? I'm really tired. First tell me what I need to hear. I love you, Lee. And I haven't been seeing anyone else. Now get some sleep, okay? You can't hide from me, Ted. Ted! Hey cutie pie. How are ya? Whoa. Oh. No. No Look, mommy, it's almost in outer space. It sure is, hon. Hmm... Make it come back Well, I can't do that. Did you ever hear the story about the little girl who was holding a balloon and a gust of wind came along and carried her away? That never happened. You're just being silly. Yes, it did. No, I'm not being silly. Aargh, aargh. Oh, ho, ho! Show you silly. I gotcha. I gotcha. I gotcha. Be careful. If I had one-tenth her energy, school would be a breeze. She's just showing off for you. Yeah. I seem to have that effect on women. Oh, no, she - she really adores you, Ted. So do i. And I adore you, Lee. So, one day maybe I won't have to share you with so many women You're so stupid Yeah. I may be stupid, but not so stupid to think you don't have plenty of other admirers. Yeah, Lee. I have admirers, but just because someone admires me doesn't mean I'm sleeping with them. Look, look, I don't want to start an argument, okay? I was just hoping we could commit to each other. Like really commit, Ted. We are committed. And I love you, so can we just focus on that? Really? Yeah. Really. Urn. Urn. What's that? What? What's that? Did you steal this, Ted? (laughs) No. Ted! Well, it's not like it's the first time it's ever happened, huh? Just - just keep your voice down, okay? Why, you afraid somebody might find out the wonderful Ted Bundy's a thief? You tell anyone that, I will break your fucking neck, you hear me? No. Take it back! Give it to one of your other girls! I didn't steal the watch, Lee! Look. Listen to me. You have a future. And you've worked so hard. What do you think is going to happen to that future if you get caught stealing, huh? Yeah, right. Why do you talk like this? It's easy, because first I flunked out of law school and now I'm flunking psychology. Ted, why didn't you tell me? I don't know, I just.. Look, there's still two months left in the semester and I can still help you. But if you just give up. Ted... Look, I didn't steal the watch. I just wanted to get something nice for my gal. Show my appreciation. After all you've done for me, all the money you've given me to stay in school, I figured it was the least I could do. It's a beautiful watch, Ted. Thank you. I'm sorry I ever doubted you. Is it good? Yes. Is it good? Yeah. Let's try something else. What? Come on. Flip over. No! No, you know I don't like that. It's disgusting. Lee, it's just another way to make love. No, it has nothing to do with love. It's just, it's dirty. Lee, sex is only dirty when you do it right. Let's just do it regular. Okay. Fine. We'll do it regular. Okay? 'cause that's what feels like love, right? Yeah? Yeah. That feel like love? Yeah? Good. How 'bout that? Ted! Does that feel like love? Huh? Does that feel like love? Ted! What about this? Does that feel like love? Oh, you're choking me! That's what love feels like to me, Lee! No! Ted! What, are you nuts? I gotta go. No. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. It's fine, Lee. It's fine. Am I going to see you tomorrow? Yeah. I'm at the crisis center from eleven to three. I'll call you when I'm done. I-I remember it was my birthday that day and afterwards, when all the kids went home, he, urn, came up into my room and made me put it in my mouth. He put it in your mouth? Yeah. I didn't want him to be all mad again. I wanted to make him happy. Did you tell anyone? Yeah, my mother. She didn't believe me. And if she did, she just looked the other way. You must have a lot of anger towards her. I don't know. She's dead now. You still there, Ted? Mh-hm, I'm still here. Well, uh, tell me one thing. Why are men such assholes? Well, I think you just haven't met the right guy. You sound like one of those right kind of guys. Thank you, Karen. Look, Karen, one day you'll find a love that's deeper and more meaningful than anything you've ever imagined. God. Do you really think so, Ted? I know so. Do you think we could talk again. Ted? I gotta go to work now. Uh-huh. Anytime, okay? Okay. Take care, Karen. All right. And don't do anything crazy. All right. (doorbell rings) Where have you been? Huh? You said you were going to call and you didn't. Ted? Ted. Oh, my God! Are you okay? What's wrong? Are you sick? Actually, I'm really hungry You really were hungry, huh? Yep. Whatcha thinkin' about? The future. How I want things to turn out. How do you want things to turn out? Well, I guess we could start with the basic premise that whoever dies with the most toys, wins. Okay. You want a lot of toys. What else? Good job. Nice clothes. New car. All the things I didn't have growing up. Maybe go into politics. I still haven't given up on that. Mm-hm. But mostly, I just want to be normal. What? You don't think you're normal? I'm trying to be. Oh, Ted... I'm really trying to be Don't make a sound. Understand? (whines) Yes? Okay, now get up. Get up. What do you want? Shut up and listen. Cooperate and everything's going to be okay. Otherwise, I'm going to kill you. Okay. Do you believe me? Yeah. Good. Now, I just broke into your apartment. Why do you want to believe me? (music) A drink? Oh, yeah. Whoa. Nice TV. Yeah, it's a gift from my parents. They're cool, huh? Yeah. So when do I get to meet your folks? Mmm ... They look like nice people. They are nice people. So what's the problem? Who said there was a problem? What, do I embarrass you? Huh? You're the most paranoid woman I ever met. No, well, you've met my parents. Yeah, and someday you'll meet mine. Someday? Don't start, Lee. Jesus. No, it's just, if there's a problem, I want to know about it. Yes, there's a problem. But just because there's a problem doesn't mean that you're the center of it. Come on, please, just tell me. I don't want there to be any secrets between us. Please? I'm illegitimate. That's it? I'm a bastard. Ooh. That's an ugly word and it should be removed from the english language. Maybe so, but it's still true. Stop saying that. Don't ever, ever, ever say that. Imagine being five years old and finding out that your sister is really your mother. Okay, and that would be a little weird. Yeah, and then being seventeen and finding out that your father's not your father. Well, they still loved you, didn't they? Yes, they loved me. Of course they loved me. Yeah. Who could not love you? Ah, damn. Aah. Whenever I see anybody carrying that many books, they're studying to be a doctor. Yeah, well, in this case, it's law school. Well, those aren't law books. No, these are for everything else. Is there any chance I can get you to help me carry these to my car? I'm basically helpless with this cast. Well, okay. But if I need any legal advice, you owe me one Its a deal. It's, uh, over here. Okay. I hope this isn't going to make you late for class. No, I'm fine. If you could just, uh, put them on the floor right there. Okay. The killer came in from the night... Just what this town needs, a psycho killer running around. Well, don't look at me. I didn't do it. I think we can rule you out as a suspect, Ted. I can't wait to see what the son-of-a-bitch looks like. You really think it's just one guy responsible? You know, what the police say and what they think are often two completely different things. That's what I think. I think that they hold a lot of stuff back so that there's stuff only the perpetrator knows. Do you think those women could still be alive? No way. They're way dead. Ted, this is a party. No one wants to talk about this. Oh, really, Lee? What subjects can we talk about? Actually, uh, I think it's fascinating. Well, I think its sick and disgusting. Well, certainly murder is aberrant behavior, but, I mean, the psychology that motivates it is really quite interesting, don't you think? Totally. I think I need a refill. I'm, so sorry. I'm Betty. Hi Betty. I'm Ted. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too. Lee, right? That's me. I'm Beverly from the crisis center. You know, I-I work with Ted at the crisis center. Oh, great. Hi. Oh, he is doing really great. I- he has an amazing knack with the callers. He always knows the exact right thing to say. Yep, he sure has a way with people, all right. Oh, my God! Please don't hurt me. I'm not going to hurt you. What do you want? I just want you to listen to me. Pay me a little bit of attention. See, girls like you, they don't pay attention to guys like me. Guys who don't came from good families. Who don't go to top schools, or drive fancy cars. (whimpers) Shut up and listen! God! Don't get me wrong. I'm not some share the wealth' type of pinko creep or something. Don't do this to me. In fact, I'm a republican. I worked on a number of campaigns, and one day, I'm gonna be governor. You don't even believe me, do you? You probably just think I'm some kind of loser. Well, maybe you're right. Maybe I'm not so important out there, but here, I'm in charge. Here, I'm in control. Because this is the court of Ted! What I say here is law! You get the picture? (screams) (screams) (cries) Do I have your attention now? And Julie's staying with your parents for how long? All month. I was kind of hoping maybe we could spend some time together alone before you went off, back to law school. I told you a thousand times, you can come with me if you want to. Your enthusiasm isn't exactly overwhelming, Ted. Hey, you gotta make your own decision. I mean, if things don't work out, I don't want it to be my fault. I don't want to argue, okay? I am just saying, we both know the reason why I am not going with you to salt lake. Mm-hm. And what is it? You don't want me to go. Oh. You know, you're giving me a headache. Is she going with you? Is who going with me That woman at the party. The one you were talking to that thought murderers were 'oh so fascinating' You're certifiable, you know that? You're a hundred percent certifiable. That's right, Ted, just dismiss it. Treat me like I'm crazy. Anybody with the audacity to disagree with the great Ted Bundy has to be crazy, right? What the hell? Asshole! You're such a fucking jerk. Look, I don't know why you're so upset. It was a joke. Where are my keys? Don't ask me. What the hell are these? I dunno. I've never seen them before. Who's a pretty girl? You are. You're the pretty girl. Yeah, you are. (knock on door) Who is it? It's me Just a minute. Look, I don't want to fight. I just want us to enjoy our time together before you have to leave. Now is that so much to ask? No. Nothing would make me happier. Mm, what's that smell? Whew. I left a bologna sandwich out on the kitchen counter. Well, it stinks. Mm-hm. Sorry. Oh, God, I love kissing you. Hmm, me, too. What? What? I have an idea. Oh, no. What has that little brain of yours come up with this time? It's just something I want to try. What? Have you ever heard of a thing called 'submission'? Well, I thought that's what I was doing every time I opened my legs. Is that what it feels like to you? Sometimes. But did you ever think there might be a little bit more to sex than just opening your legs? I just want to make love. So, hmm, what could be more loving than having me take total control? Okay. Just make sure it doesn't hurt. It's not going to hurt. And it doesn't make me feel degraded, either. Will you stop worrying? Oh, God, Ted, I just want to make you happy. Goddamnit! I hope you're having fun, 'cause I'm not. All right. All right. All right, don't talk. Don't move. Don't even breathe. What? What, you can't pretend that you are dead? You serious? Yes, I'm serious! Just give it a fucking try, okay? Okay! I love you, Ted, and if that's what you want- I want it. Do it. Okay, open your eyes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Fuck ... You ... Bitch! Fuck ... You ... Bitch! Aah ... Aah ... Aah ... ... Aah ... Aaah ... Hi. Excuse me. I'm uh, sorry to bother you, but, uh, I was wondering if you could help me out. Help you out with what? Uh, with my sailboat I hate asking, but, uh, I basically can't do anything with this cast. I'll take you for a ride in it, if you'd like. Please? Pretty please? Okay. Okay. Just don't beg. Sure. It's, uh, right over this way. I'm Ted. What's your name? Shawn. Hi, shawn. H-hey! I thought you needed help unloading your sailboat. Yeah, it's at my folk's place just up the hill. Didn't I mention that? No. Well, is that a problem? Mm, I guess not. Great. Hop in. Don't touch me! You know what? I hope you're not going to act like this all day If you don't start with me, I'll be fine. I, uh, are you on the rag or something? Shut up! Goddamn lemmings. Look at them all. They fester like a bunch of rats. If they're all rats and lemmings, then what does that make us? I like how you make me do all the work. Hey, I brought the cooler down. Whatever. Where is everybody? They could be anywhere. Well, shouldn't we go look far them? Right now, I just want to drink my beer. Fine. Wh-whoa, where do you think you're going? I gotta pee. Is that okay, your lordship? Jesus. Excuse me. Uh, I'm sorry to bother you, but is there any chance you could help me out with something? Help you out with what? Well, with my sailboat. Urn, see, I'm having trouble, uh, unloading it with this stupid cast here, and I'd really appreciate it if you'd give me a hand. (screaming) Okay, that was a mistake, bitch. I'll be right back, kitten. (screaming) Hi, again. (screaming) Get off! (screaming) Are you ready for some fun, kitten? Give me that. Thank you, munchkin. Well, guess this is it. Won't be seeing you for a while, little one. I don't want you to go. When you're here, it's like we're a family. Yeah, but I gotta go to college so I can become a lawyer and buy lots of nice things for you and mommy. Will you still come see us? Mm-hm. And you can come visit me, too. In Utah? You got it. You be good, okay, munchkin? All right. This is it. Call me, okay? As soon as I get settled. See you in the funny papers. We just found a third body. What kind of shape's this one in? They're all skeletonized. Nothing good. Seven heads and three bodies. Jesus! Thanks for the ride. I really appreciate it. Sure. Where're you headed? Silver canyon. How 'bout you? Me, too are you from around here? No. Holy shit. Look at that. (screams) Fuck ... You! Fuck ... You! Fuck... Fuck ... You ... Bitch fuck ... Fuck fuck ... Fuck Excuse me, ma'am. Ma'am. I'm Officer Roseland with the Murray police department. I'm sorry to bother you, but it looks like somebody's broken into your car. What? Yeah, I'm sorry, ma'am, you're going to have to come with me. Do you have any identification? I mean... Ma'am. I mean, how did you know it was my car? Well, what kind of a car do you drive? Green imperial. I'm sorry, but that's the one. Fuck! Mom's gonna kill me if anything happened to that. It's still locked. It hasn't even been touched. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to file a report, ma'am. But there is nothing to report. Its fine. Our sub-station's just around the corner here. This is so stupid! You have, like, the wrong car or something! Its for your own protection, ma'am. Your station's back here? Oh, it's a substation, ma'am. It's really just an office. Our headquarters is a few blocks from here. Well, I hope it smells better than this. I assure you, ma'am, it does. We're just to the right, here. Damn, it's locked. My partner must have already taken the guy in. What guy? The one who broke into your car. But nobody broke into my car, so Sorry, ma'am, I'm going to have to ask you to accompany me to the station. In this? Its the dumbest looking cop car I've ever seen. It's a civilian car, ma'am. Department budget only goes so far. Oh, great. The police station's not over this way. What the fuck are you doing? Fuck! What the fuck are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? You son-of-a-bitch! Kill you ... The fuck ... Oh, fuck. Fuck. I'm gonna fuckin' kill you! Don't fucking move or I will blow your head off! You hear me? Yes. Are you gonna be a good little girl? Yes. Huh? Yes! Fuck. Jesus. Fucker! Uuhh! Fuck. God! Stupid, stupid, stupid! Ted, don't mess around! Ted, hit her in the head! Bye. See ya later. Hey. Oh, my God! You scared me to death. Here, let me get that for you. Oh, thank you. That's so sweet. Don't mention it. Wow, you're just a kid, aren't you? No, I'm actually almost eighteen. I didn't mean to insult you, it's just ... No, forget it. Wait. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to sound like such a bitch. I just, you know, I don't like when people say I'm like some kind of baby or anything. That's okay, kid. Forget it. Boy, you're batting a thousand, aren't you? Look, I'm sorry. Don't mean to be a jerk. It's just that when I first saw you, I got kinda turned on. But now that I can see how young you are no offense intended there either, but well, let's just say that I'm too old for you and leave it at that. Well, you may be too old for me, but that still doesn't make me a kid. Good point. Another one? All right. Oh, boy, look at this! Oh, is it a boy or girl? It's a girl. We know. You must have been a really good girl for Santa to bring you all these presents. Uh-huh, I was. Okay, well, let's see what's next. Why don't you try this one? Oh, my gosh! We know. Just what you needed! Thank you! You're welcome. Hello? Hello? Hello? Jesus mister. What is it, your heart or something? (siren) Hey, I'm sorry, officer- You stop right there I didn't see you back- Now! Put your hands above your head! Okay. No problem. Turn around! Put your hands on your head. All right. Okay. You don't need to explain the law to me. I-I go to law school. Yeah we checked that out, and you sure do. And I worked on the "Thompson for governor" campaign. You can ask him about me. A law student active in politics. But what's a groovy guy like you driving around with a rape kit in his car? Look, I told you, it's not a rape kit. I can explain to you every single thing you found in there. I don't know, Ted. A nylon stocking mask with eye slits, a hacksaw, a crowbar with duct tape around the handle, a knife, a rope, handcuffs. Lock-picking tools? So far you haven't explained anything. I think I've explained things pretty well. Well, let me ask you something else, okay, Ted? Look, it's your show. Dig it. Knock yourself out. Great. So, urn, you ever hear of a girl named Tina Gabler? No. Well, that's funny. She saw your picture and she insists that you're the guy that tried to kidnap her from the mall the couple of months ago. Well, she's wrong. Well, you wouldn't mind standing in a lineup then, would you? You're wasting your time, but if it'll make you happy, go ahead. Look, why don't we get back to that stuff later? I'm going to read you a list of names and see if any of them ring a bell, okay? Look- Just shut up. Okay, Ted, listen. Barbara Vincennes, Karen Stills, Suzanne Welch, Karen Parks? Brenda Ball? Patricia Garber? Miriam Cutler? Shawn Randall? Lucy Lee? Melissa Smith? Wendy Fit? Anita Mintier? Stephanie Merkson? Ellen Carter? Betsy Walter? Lynn Adams? You never heard of any of these women? Look, I don't like the tone of your voice. This interview's over. My dearest Lee. I feel my heart is going to break as I write this letter. Here I sit in a cage like some kind of animal. So much for the humanity of mankind. The so-called authorities are continuing to persecute me, even though their case is a total joke. They act like I'm supposed to be remorseful, even though I've done nothing to feel remorseful for. Maybe its all for the better 'cause it makes me appreciate our love all the more. For even if I'm locked in a cage, I think of the love that we have and I am able to be free, if only for a moment. I know I haven't always treated you the way you deserve, but I'm only a man and sometimes it's just so hard. But all that melts in the face of the love as strong as the love I feel for you. Ever lovin', Ted. (sobs.) I want to talk to you about something. Sure. Please don't think that I'm trying to add to your problems here okay? I mean, I know you've got a lot on your mind lately. Okay? Okay? And-and the years that we've been together, I have been completely faithful to you, an honor that I know you haven't always reciprocated. Even here in prison, I've been willing to give you the benefit of the doubt. But when I hear on TV that you've got some girlfriend coming visiting you, that's when I have to ask myself what am I doing here? Is that what this is about? Look, Lee, that woman is working for me. She's trying to get me outta here. I'm in prison, for Christ's sake. I can't control what they say on TV. Lee, honey- No! No more 'Lee, honey'! Now you tell me right now, is that woman your girlfriend? No. You're my girlfriend, Lee. Now there's something I need to tell you. Okay. I'm being charged again. What? For some girl's murder. Some girl? Yeah, but their case is totally weak. They will never get a conviction. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No. Lee... Lee! Get me outta here. Lee. Theodore Robert Bundy was taken from his cell in Colorado state prison and brought to Aspen, where he will stand trial for the murder of Terry Bell whom authorities claim was abducted from the Pinewood ski resort last Christmas. All right, Ted, las get these chains off you buddy. All right, Randy. Thanks. You seem kind of excited this morning. Cooking up something for your defense, huh? Yeah, I got a few ideas. Lets get the legs off real quick. Hey, Randy. Yeah, Ted, what's goin' on? Why do women wear makeup and use perfume? I don't know. Why, Ted? Because they're ugly and they stink. For your sake, I sure hope you've thought this through. You know the old saying: An attorney that represents himself has a fool for a client Yeah, that's what I've heard. Thanks, man. Good luck now buddy. Thank you Hey, Ted. I'm gonna have a smoke in the hall, okay? Okay. Bastard! Bundy's loose! I repeat, Bundy's loose! Bundy's loose! Bundy jumped out of this second story window at the front of the Pitkin County courthouse this morning. Witnesses say he left in a hurry. However, nobody saw him open the window. And he escaped clean in an unknown direction (screams) Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! This is so terrible! It's okay. Oh, God. How could I do it? You didn't know. How could I have ever touched him? Ssh. It's okay. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Hi, Ted. Welcome back. Ooh. Oh, God. Oh, Ted. If I didn't have this visit to look forward to, I think I'd go insane. I-I tried to come last week, but you know, with Christmas and all, I just couldn't find the time. No, it's okay. Did you get the money I sent? yeah. Thanks. I'm going to pay you back. I know you will. Just as soon as we get you out of this place. Yeah. We'll see. They want to kill me. What are you talking about? Who wants to kill you? They're moving my trial to Colorado Springs. I don't understand They're asking for the death penalty. They don't think they've got justice unless they kill somebody. But their case is so weak. They framed me once, they can frame me again Okay, Bundy, wrap it up. Okay. Look, I'm sorry. I haven't seen you in two weeks, and here I am talking about myself. How are you? How was Christmas Oh, it was good. I liked seeing my parents. What they must think of me. Don't worry about it. I'm here and I love you, buddy. And soon ... Very soon we're going to be together, okay? Yeah Come on, Bundy. Let's go Whatever happens, just know that I love you. I love you. Theodore Robert Bundy, believed by authorities to be the worst mass murderer in U.S. History, and who some investigators are saying is responsible for up to one hundred and fifty brutal sex murders throughout the country. Has escaped from custody for the second time. One detective familiar with the case is warning the public that Bundy should be considered extremely dangerous and that it's only a matter of time before he kills again. Lord have mercy. Listen, mister, whatever you're selling, I ain't buying. I'm here about the ad in the paper. You still got that room for rent? No offense, but you don't look like you'd know what to do with a room if n you had one. I got money. Right here. Mama! Mama! All right! What the hell are you carrying on about? Mama, this here is... Chris hagen. Mama, this here's Chris. And he'd like to rent a room. He gives me his word he can pay Hell, I'd give a dog the best room in the house 'he had the money to pay for it. Cash. Yes, ma'am. You won't regret it. Yeah. And don't be botherin' me anymore. I couldn't believe it. I mean, I know we haven't been dating that long, but I, at least, expect him to buy me something for Christmas. He didn't give you anything? Sure he gave me something. The only thing he's been trying to give me all year long. What are you talking about? You know what I mean. No, I don't. Tell you what, a few more of those and I will just tell you all about it, girl. Good evening, ladies. How would you like to help me finish my pitcher of beer? We love being helpful Great.

No, she's just not really good in social situations. She'll be all right. So, are you a teacher here? Yeah. Yeah, I am. If you'll excuse me. No excuse. Wasn't tonight fun? Yes.

Good night. Good night, Lara! Good night. See you tomorrow. Asshole! Jesus. (screaming) Some fucked up shit. How you doin', Randy? I tell you what, Chris, its a crazy world we're livin' in. No argument there. Hear about that psycho last night? Went and killed two girls and then beat two others half to death. L-less than a mile from here. Yeah, I heard about that. Why would somebody do a thing like that for? I wish I knew. I mean, goddamn. I guess some people are just compelled to kill. I'm compelled to hit my mama over the head just about everyday, but I don't do it, goddamnit. But still, you gotta admire the guy who did it.

It is further ordered that on such scheduled date, that you be put to death by a current of electricity sufficient to cause your immediate death. And such current of electricity shall continue to pass through your body until you are dead. I can tell you that everything's moving ahead with plans for the execution at seven A.M. Bundy was offered a last meal about forty minutes ago. He was offered steak and eggs, and he refused it. Prison officials are now preparing to shave his head and prepare him for execution at seven o'clock. I would like to go right in there and see him fry. Burn Ready for him to die. Snap, crackle, pop, buddy. Justice- justice is gonna be served at seven o'clock, bud. (crowd noise) I-I don't want to die. I'm not going to lie to you. I admit that. And I'm not asking for clemency. I'm not asking for forgiveness. I'm not asking for sympathy. I know they're going to kill me sooner or later. Uh, you don't need to worry about that. But but there's a lot of crimes I could solve if the state could just see fit to let me live for two or three years longer. I-I mean look, I know I'm not like other people. I know I can't feel sympathy for other people. But I'm still human. And then I cut her head off with the hacksaw, and I took it home with me. I mean, there's so much more to me than this guy that goes around doing those crazy things. I, so much more. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies. Thou anointest my head with oil. My cup runneth over. Surely, goodness and mercy will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the lord forever and ever. Amen, Ted. Amen. Amen, Ted. Hallelujah. Hello, Ted.
