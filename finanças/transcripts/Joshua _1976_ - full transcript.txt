Would someone care for some more stew? No I, I'm not... That sure is a pretty wife you got there. She's my new bride from back east. You're a mighty lucky man.

Some men rode by yesterday, took my wife, and killed Martha. Where is she burried? Looks like we lost 'em in the rocks Sam. We did trail 'em as far as we could. Who's that? Martha's boy Josh. That rifle you got, it belonged to my pa. It was all Martha owned. Wherebouts did you loose 'em, sheriff? About 10 miles east in the hills. But there's five of them. I just finished fighting me a war sheriff, and I killed nearly twice that many. [ Men talking inaudibly ] [ Sam's wife yells, men laugh ] Take care of that stuff, jed! Don't bruise her! Ow! Woah!

Hyah! - Jed, what's that black rider want? - What we gon' do now, jed? Let's just keep moving. I know a town he'd be plum loco to try to follow US into. Let's go. [ Horse neighs ] - Howdy. - Howdy. I'm lookin' for three men and a woman who might've rode this way. Don't recall seein' 'em. You're welcome to stop and rest awhile. You look tired. Thank you. Rod, this stranger here is lookin' for three men and a woman. Who rode this way. I asked him to stop and rest a spell. Good. Howdy, I'm rod. - Josh. - These folks are friends of yours, Josh? - Nope. - Been on the trail long? - A couple days. - Must get lonely riding out there all alone. Got my horse. I can tell by the way you got your gun to your leg, you're a gunslinger,right? Maybe you're a bounty hunter, or maybe you're an outlaw. Thank you for the coffee ma'am, I'd better be moving on. You gotta stay and taste my cooking, I'm the best around. Thank you ma'am, but I better be movin' on. Right, so you can catch up to those folks and gun 'em down. Maybe there's a sheriff behind tracking you. Why don't you stay a spell longer, friend. Toss it over here. You ever kill a man before? You know what it feels like to kill? I killed in the war. People I didn't even know. Only the battleground is different now. You wanna kill me? Go ahead. [ Harmonica playing ] Bartender? More whiskey. [ All chatting ] You know something jed? You was right about that black rider. He ain't gonna come to this town lookin' for US. That black riders' making me more crazy than ever was. [ Patrons laughing ] [ Ominous music plays ] Stand easy mister. I don't like guns pointed at me ma'am. And I'll use it too if'n you make a move. - Might friendly, ain't ya? - Who are you mister? Why don't I just wait and tell your friends? We've got company. They ain't my friends. They're part of a bunch of renegades that run the town. Lost hombre? What you lookin' for around these parts? I'm lookin' for three men and a woman who rode this way a short time ago. You a bounty hunter? You lawman? Neither one. Stranger ain't welcome around these parts. I'm beginning to get that feeling. If you don't mind, I'll move on. Yeah well the woman stays with US. That's fine with me. You can ride out the same way you came in. That ain't the way I'm headed. Now I can either ride around you or through you. Either way. Well you better look around before you start anything. All I have to do is raise my hand and you're a dead man. You do, be the last time you raise it. [ Gunshots ] Mount up! [ Gunshots ] [ Gunshots ] Let me go! No, no, stop! Let go of my horse, leave me alone! Leave me alone! Go away! Let me have my horse, please! Go away! Please, please! Go away! Leave me alone! We're boxed in. Uh! Ah! Uh! [ Both men grunting ] Can you make it from here? I guess so. My place is just a few miles away. I'll round up the horses for you. What about you? Where do you go? My fightin' ain't over yet lady. [ Harmonica playing ] Hey partner, hey. Bartender? You got a place we can bed down for the night? Yeah, uh, got a couple of sheds in the back you can use. And you can sleep tonight with me. No she can't. She's my woman now. Well how come I can't sleep with her? You just do like I tell you. You go out there and stay that shed by yourself. I ain't goin', out there with that dark chap all by myself. Then I'm stayin' here with you. [ Ominous music plays ] A double. Rye or whiskey? Whiskey'll do just fine. Bar's closed. I'm lookin for three men and a woman. You see them ride through here? Who wants to know? Nah, we didn't see any. I followed their tracks here. You sure you ain't seen 'em? You callin' my friend a liar? You achin' for trouble Sonny. But I ain't aimin' to start none. You got a big mouth stranger, my men will shut it. You'll never make it. I asked you a question. They headed north. [ Knocking ] Who's there? Weasle. There's a man lookin' for you. Was he black? Yup, he sure was. What do you want? We figure it's worth somethin' to you to see that he don't bother you no more. [ Inaudible gibberish ] What's your price? We figure maybe... A hundred apiece? Now you bring him to me. Dead. And you'll get your money. [ Gunshots ] Mm-mm. [ Speaking Spanish ] Let's take him to the abandoned shack. You found that in me? Well. Glad to see you awake mister. My name is Joshua. Mine is Maria. Well Joshua. Looks like the worst of your travels ain't over yet. You've got a very high fever. And I reckon pretty soon you're gonna be a sick fella. Looks like everytime we meet, somebody's always gettin' shot. Yeah, except this time it's you. You must want these fellas pretty bad to follow them into this territory. I didn't have no choice. You a bounty hunter? No ma'am. I'm gonna kill 'em. That's all men think of. Killing. [ Inaudible mumbling ] I think the worst of your fever's over. [ Door opens ] [ Speaking Spanish ] You talked a lot during your fever last night. You talked about three men and a woman riding into town. So I sent one of my men to check on it. And theyre still there. Nuh-uh, hold it, hold it, easy now. You're gonna need more time than that. Maybe after a good meal you will be stronger. So I stayed on after my husband was killed. That lady with these fellas, she your woman? Nope. You really have to do it, don't you? Josh? After your fight is over... Maybe you come back? [ Snoring ] [ Gunshots ] [ Inaudible ] [ Horses neighing ] [ Inaudible yelling ] How 'bout you, where are ya? [ Gasps ] [ Dramatic music plays ] [ Thunder rumbling ] I don't like it. That black riders' still on our trail! Weasle, bring up some fresh water. Weasle! Where are you? Weasle! Let's go. Weasle! Come on weasle, where are ya? Weasle, come on! Please don't leave me mister, leave me- [ Inaudible babbling ] [ Inaudible babbling continues ] [ Gunshot ] Wait, jed! Come on, let's go! Ah!

I'm not one of them! [Jed] Who are you? No! No... Who are you!? [ Gunshot ] I'm my mother's son. [ Dramatic music plays ]
