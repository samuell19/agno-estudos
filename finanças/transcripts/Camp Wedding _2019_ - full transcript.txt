[FOOTSTEPS RUSTLING] To live a life free of sin, it is not enough to follow the rules. The moral and just answers to life's difficult questions lie within you. And you'll find ways to ignore them, to twist them, to serve your selfish desires but deep down you know what is correct. JAMES 4:17, "If you do not do what you know is right, you have sinned." [BIRDS CHIRPING] [DARK DRAMATIC MUSIC] You do realize your venue has a past. Everything has a past. No, I mean like a past. Like little did they know, 200 years ago... [MESSAGE ALERT BEEPS] In a relationship? Alexis? - Oh shit, sorry, - [MESSAGE ALERT DINGS] I didn't realize you'd get a notification. I didn't mean to upstage your wedding, Mia. Are you kidding? Gore, like that post. Who's the guy? Totally stalking him. [KEYPAD CLICKING] Hello, Danny Ralston. Cute. [SINISTER MUSIC] [KEYPAD POPPING] You guys are hilarious. Gore, are you going to post anything funny for me? [KEYPAD CLICKING] [KEYPAD POPPING] I'm really happy for you. Sorry, was that super dramatic? Sometimes I forget how to interact with real people. #momproblems. More like #everyoneproblems. - Totally posting that. - [KEYPAD CLICKING] [SINISTER MUSIC] - [REMINDER BELL RINGING] - [KEYPAD CLICKING] Oh shit, it's grapefruit time, Gore. Grapefruit time? It's for the Bride Boheme Cleanse. Mmm, it was on the man of honor checklist. I must have missed that email. [MIA SIGHS] [SENT MESSAGE WHOOSHING] There were a lot of emails. Man of honor fail. [BIRDS CHIRPING] - Was that it? - [KEYPAD CLICKING] Okay, you're not navigating. [TIRES SCREECHING] Sorry, I was posting a humorous comment on Alexis's profile for you. Oh, okay, right, you're using the OkCupid app to do that. - Okay sorry, I went on like four dates yesterday and... - Four? Yeah, it's like sending out resumes. And no one's gotten back to me. It's just very surprising. Camp Pocumtuck. [SINISTER MUSIC] It was a steal on Airbnb and we're their first wedding. You booked a summer camp on Airbnb? [MIA] You can book anything on Airbnb. "Electronic devices will not be tolerated." Is this place Amish? [MIA] I think it's so the kids can experience nature. "Inter-camper liaisons will not be tolerated." - [GIGGLES] Stupid. - [CAMERAS CLICKING] "Gum chewing, gambling, and public nudity will not be tolerated." Interesting assortment. "Drugs and alcohol will not be tolerated." Sorry, Camp Putuck, I didn't pump three-days' worth of breast milk to stay sober. [CHUCKLING] Well, I for one am gonna have a serious inter-camper liaison. - Oh yeah. - With Dalvaro. And I expect all of your electronic devices to be posting up a storm to #MiaCampWedding. [BIRD CAWING] - Should I add #whatadivadoes? - [KEYPAD CLICKING] Oh no, that's just my personal one. It's for my opera posts. Are we finally going to get to hear you sing at the talent show? Uhm, I haven't worked with my voice teacher for a while. Oh, I forgot to mention that the service is really kind of sketchy so posts and texts will work but phone calls really won't work. Text Scott. Can't do Jefferson bedtime story. Wasn't informed there was no service, ellipses. It was in the bridal party email. [OMINOUS MUSIC] [BIRDS CHIRPING] - [CAMERA CLICKING] - Oh. [PAULETTE] Please delete that. I can't. It's a Polaroid. Then just burn it and you won't owe me for the cab. [CHUCKLES] Oh man. Mia's Kickstarter video was badass but it's better IRL. You should pay for your wedding yourself. But it's the crowdfunding that made it a Bride Boheme Special Feature. Mia really nailed the cross-promotion. Wow, this Mia sounds pretty amazing. - Whoa, you haven't met Mia? - Nope. But I thought you were the groom's best friend. Mmm hmm. [CAR RUSTLING] Oh shit they're coming! I got to hide. - Here first hold my gum. - Oh. Okay. [OMINOUS MUSIC] Oh, oh my gosh. It's so dilapidated. I love it. Okay, so we have a few wedding prep things and then we can enjoy the outdoorsy bachelorette fun. Oh sorry we couldn't do a girls' night in the city, honey. Our schedules just... It's okay. This is going to be way better, you guys. I didn't want one of those obnoxious bachelorette parties. Oh let the bachelorette-palooza begin. [MIA SHOUTING] And hi! Oh, Eileen, my friend from... - Community Theater, yeah. - Community Theater. - You took forever. - Oh. - Oh! - Oh, thank you so much for including me. Oh, thank you for coming all this way. Hi. Hi. Paulette, it's really nice to meet you. [EILEEN] Man of honor. [GORE] Oh, you know who I am. - Yeah. - I, okay. And this one's for you. Thank you. And the biggest and the brightest. Let's get this party started. I've got your favorite, Bloody Eight fixings. - And penis straws. - Oh my gosh, that sounds really great. I was just thinking that we were gonna get some lunch. And then we have a brief production meeting in, you know, 20 minutes. So, um maybe later. - Babe, your... - [GENTLE MUSIC] I bet. [MIA LAUGHING] All right, smile, you guys. - It's my first #MiaCampWedding. - [CAMERA CLICKING] - Okay, so good. All right. - Some info, this is yours. Here you are. Here you go. Take this one, Gore. - Alrighty, so I think. - [GORE WHISTLING] Everybody's almost done lunch. Well, I'm sorry, I know you said everything would be gluten free, but since you don't have a gluten-free kitchen, I didn't want to take any chances. All this is supposed to be accomplished today? No, no, just the Friday to do. Yeah, I'm referring to the Friday to do. It's really not that much. I mean, we just have to get the playhouse ready for the talent show. And then we need to get the cabins done for the guests. -[BIRD CAWING] Not going to take that long. And then we're gonna come back here, we're gonna arrange some tables, throw up some lights, and we're going to have so much fun. Oh, I almost forgot, we have butterfly nets so like if you happen to be prepping and you find a butterfly, 'cause we're going to have a butterfly release. [GASPS] Oh my God. - Let's do this! - I get it. It's a plantation wedding really. [DOOR CLATTERING] Guys, this is how weddings work. I mean, we didn't have to throw her a shower or a bachelorette party. And she let us pick out whatever dress we wanted. - Hmm, as long as it was pink. - [PAULETTE SLURPING] Hey, you know she would be just as ridiculous - about helping us with our weddings. - We eloped. I mean, let's just suck it up and help make her dream come true. [GENTLE MUSIC] [LIVELY MUSIC] [MESSAGE ALERT DINGS] - [PHONE VIBRATING] - [BOSS] Nice pic on Facebook. I did not approve this vacation. - Hey, how's it coming? - Hey. Great. Okay, so are all the other cabins done? Did you split them up with Paulette? No. I was just getting this one wrapped up and then I was going to go over to the next one and get going. - So, none of the other cabins are done. - No. Okay, where is Paulette? I don't know. [DOOR CLATTERING] [GENTLE MUSIC] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] "Meet me tonight in the clearing across the lake." I want you to be my first kiss. "Chuck." [WHIMPERS] [GASPS] [LIQUID TRICKLING] [MESSAGE VIBRATING] [DALVERO] We need to talk. Meet by the camp entrance tonight after bedtime. [SIGHS] [GENTLE MUSIC] [DARK EERIE MUSIC] [PULSING MUSIC] Oh my God! You have to see this. [LIGHT MUSIC] Yeah, what happened to the chair rental? - This camp was intense. - [DARK EERIE MUSIC] Yeah, that's crazy. Can you clear the stage and cover whatever that is? And you can figure out the whole lighting, sound situation, right? Sure. All right, okay. Oh, so it's time for canoeing? Yeah, just come whenever you're done. [GORE SIGHS] - [BOARD THUDDING] - [DARK EERIE MUSIC] [PHONE VIBRATING] [DANNY] I'm so hungry for you. [SCOTT] Jefferson's only allergic to hazelnuts, right? - [BULBS CLINKING] - Fuck, sorry. - No, my fault. Nothing broke? - No, we're good. - [PHONE VIBRATING] - [DANNY] Get over here. We only have the weekend before my girlfriend gets back from that wedding. - [BULBS SHATTERING] - Fuck! [GRUNTS] Sorry, just got a weird text message. I'm just gonna have to find service. Okay, but if you see any pretty wildflowers, can you bring them and then you... [DOORS CLATTERING] [MIA SIGHS] Dom. Dom. [GRUNTS] 13. Oh hey, oh it was 14. How are the cabins going? Yeah, actually I'm all done. We going to canoe? Yeah. So maybe you could help Eileen with her cabin 'cause she's falling behind. Okay, and you're going to... I got to do high intensity interval training every three hours to reduce water weight and flush my skin. [BIRDS CHIRPING] Paulette? [OMINOUS MUSIC] Text Scott. Walnuts, exclamation point. Is Jefferson all right, question mark. Fucking text me back, period. [BIRD CAWING] Call Scott. - [EERIE MUSIC] - [WIND HOWLING] [PHONE RINGING] [PHONE BUZZING] [BRANCH CRACKING] [MESSAGE ALERT BEEPING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] [TINKLING MUSIC] - We'll catch up tomorrow. - [MIA SIGHS] - Are you sure your text went through? - Yeah, I am. Are you sure nobody's seen Flynn since before dinner? Maybe she's looking for a gluten-free kitchen. [GORE CHUCKLES] You guys, she gets really sick. That's why I got gluten-free everything. Wait, these are gluten-free s'mores? [OMINOUS MUSIC] Oh, Jesus! Oh thank God. I need to use the van to get somewhere with service, okay? Scott has Jefferson's nut allergies confused. Is he okay? Scott's not getting back to me and I'm supposed to call him at bedtime and I've never been away from him. I'm just the only designated driver and I just got Lasik so I'm not allowed to drive at night for like a month and, but if you need to make a call... You got Lasik? Yeah. Dalvero got it for me as a surprise so I can go water skiing in Cancun. - [ALL] Oh. - [FLYNN SIGHS] You could walk to Bufflehorn. It's just 7.8 miles. [GRUNTS] Fuck it. It's your weekend. He'll be fine. I just need to trust. Are you going to be okay? Did you get dinner? I had some flax chips. Oh my God, you must be starving. The s'mores are gluten-free. Yeah, they're right out of the package. They weren't in my kitchen, just here. Take mine. It's not part of the Bride Boheme Cleanse. Now that we're all here, maybe a little sneak peak into the talent show? [ANIMALS WARBLING EERILY] Summer 1985, Camp Pocumtuck. A picture of youthful innocence until it is deflowered by death! Wait, are you part of the talent show? Yeah. Ghost story, summer camp. - Too tropey? - Yeah. But it's true. I did the research. As did I. It was a social experiment gone awry. [EERIE MUSIC] That's pretty obvious. But did you know that the girl drowned because she was struck by lightning? - [AIR WHOOSHING] - Odd. Wait, what are they talking about? There was just some unrest in the '80s. A camper drowned, it was an accident. And honestly, in the history of a camp, one death, it's kind of amazing. This is also the location of an Indian massacre. [DRAMATIC OMINOUS MUSIC] And there were some witch trials up the road. - [DRAMATIC OMINOUS MUSIC] - [WOMAN SCREAMING] Nothing Salem level but some girls got immolated. [FIRE SNAPPING] Wait, is someone else doing horror spoken word? No, they're not but I think maybe you should try something else a little less maudlin. Like what did you decide to sing? [CLEARS THROAT] "Battle Hymn of the Republic." What, you said it had to be rights free because of Bride Boheme taking video but it's difficult to find public domain songs and have time to rehearse when you're a mom, okay? And I just sang it for Jefferson's 1776 party. Why don't you guys sing that together? [CRUNCHING] Are these handmade marshmallows? Yeah, they're from that great little place in my hood. All marshmallows are gluten-free. - I checked. - [SPITS] No! All mass-produced ones are but some of the handmade ones use flour in the process. [SPITTING] Oh my God! [SPITTING] - Oh my God! - What the fuck is that? Vodka. Wheat or potato-based? Cheap. It's okay. I'll know in a couple of hours. [TENSE MUSIC] - Another one. - Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. No green piles still? - Flynn! - Oh shit, my tolerance is gone. Guys, help me drink all this gluten-free beer so it's a fair fight. Oh, got enough of this. [MIA] Bride Boheme Cleanse. - I'm okay. - [BOTTLES CLANKING] You're refusing alcohol? Are you pregnant? [GORE GRUNTING] - Flick fly. - Oh, fuck! Ah ha ha ha ha. [ALEXIS] Should we see if Eileen and Paulette want to play? Can we discuss Eileen and Paulette? Yeah. I know Paulette's. Dalvero's weird college friend but Eileen. I accidentally invited Eileen. [GORE SIGHS] ♪ Na na na na na na na ♪ [BOSS] Not going to sugarcoat this. You're fired. [EILEEN SIGHS] so autocorrect thinking I typed in Flynn's name and now she thinks she's a bridesmaid so, yeah. [SOMBER MUSIC] [WATER SPLASHING] - [PAULETTE SIGHING] - [KEYPAD CLICKING] [PAULETTE VOICEOVER] Can you be more specific than camp entrance and after bedtime? [SENT MESSAGE WHOOSHING] [PERSON CLATTERING] [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [OMINOUS MUSIC] Shit, fuck, whore. Oh, fuck I miss swearing. Are you guys getting baby pressure yet? Yeah, ever since we announced the date. Fuckety fuck fuck! But, you know, it's just for the taxes in other words. [SPUTTERS] Everything changes. Shit! It's like a mortgage. You sure he's a safe investment? Yeah, what does that mean, Alexis? - Blitz. - Mother of God, shit, whore! Fuck you. I... [CRYING] I got to take five. - [CRICKETS CHIRPING] - [TENSE RHYTHMIC MUSIC] Wow, you just let her have that fantasy? She thought you two were having a fren-a-ssance. [SCOFFS] Should have let the poor girl off the hook. - [EERIE MUSIC] - [WIND WHOOSHING] What, it's a long story. I mean, if anybody was supposed to apologize, it's her. [ALEXIS] You guys, blitz pile. There are these guys with these scary fucking masks out in the woods! [CRYING] - Couldn't they just be other Airbnb renters? - No, I booked the whole camp. I guess the escaped convicts that are going to rape and murder us didn't book their crime scene on Airbnb. Were the strippers not a joke? Oh, you would've killed me. You hate all flavors of exploitation. - [KNOCKING] - [ALL SCREAMING] [DARK EERIE MUSIC] Gluten-free knife, just in case. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] - Fuck this! - [LAUGHING] - What the fuck? - Yeah, I'm sorry, boo. You were supposed to come tomorrow. My fault, I had Jack drive us up. Dalvero didn't even know. Yeah, well he knew he was wearing a mask to scare the shit out of us. It was really poor judgment on our part. But this way we can help you first thing tomorrow. Hey. Oh, hey, you made it. Shocked? I'm Trask, groomsman. Sorry if you all thought I was a murderer. This is Jack, best man, designated driver. And you all know Dalvero. Uh, sorry to psychologically molest you all. Hi, I'm Eileen. I'm not supposed to be here but I'm just going with it. Okay, I think we should all just go to bed because we have a very big day tomorrow. - The big day, boo. - [MIA CHUCKLES] Sweet dreams. [DALVERO] Come on, Jack. - Oh, mother of God. - Who is Trask? He's one of Dalvero's douchey work friends. He's really not that sexy. Bride blindness, he's everything. Okay, lights out, all right? We kind of got a lot to do tomorrow. - He's kind of too much. - No such thing. Mia, what team? [SPUTTERING] Straight guys don't look like that. Oh, Flynn, welcome to the decade of CrossFit. I'll take one for the team and propose some inter-camper liaisons. [FLYNN GIGGLING] Dalvero mentioned he had a wife. He could be bi. - And polyamorous. - Well, what about Jack? You guys seemed to have a little moment there and you bonded over hating Tom Hanks at my engagement party. And we made out and he never responded to my follow-up text. Bridal Yenta fail. Anyway I've moved on to Traskier things. Who doesn't love Tom Hanks? Good night. [TENSE ELECTRONIC MUSIC] Well, he said he'd text me but... Oh, pull the fucking reigns on that. If you like him, text him. - It's late. - Fuck late. Late's hot. Late's desperate. Ignore the man who hasn't dated since high school. I am very happily married. That was before apps and texting. Dating is like espionage now. I'll get intelligence from Mia. Fuck, I'm out. [LAUGHING] Good night. Come on, one more round. [HANDS THUDDING] I can bet a professional lap dance worth $55. - It's how I paid for my MBA. - Off! It's your last night of freedom. Taste the magic. - Go the fuck to sleep. - On the house then. Show them my loyalty to you and the bank knows no bounds. Stop kissing ass. You'll get VP. [JACK SIGHS] You're really stiff for this guy. Ah shit. Best man speech. Come with me. I got just the thing. [FOOTSTEPS CRUNCHING] The fucking outdoors! [OMINOUS MUSIC] Re-trip, then you do your speech. Tomorow'll be easy. Genius, right? I've never actually uh... Oh. Virgin territory. [JACK CHUCKLING] Okay, electronic devices will not be tolerated. Please. There's so much to do. You friends with Trask on Facebook? Powering down. Dalvero's substance abuse issues are well known to his friends. He is literally addicted to substance. [CHUCKLES] [TRASK LAUGHING] He binges podcasts. Terry Gross is his celeb crush. And he'd donate a kidney to Noam Chomsky. [LAUGHING] I'm going to pee in my pants. [TENSE MUSIC] When I get back you're totally going to sext that Gore dude. [EERIE MUSIC] [PHONE VIBRATING] [TRASK VOICEOVER] Hey, it's Trask. Want to meet at the playhouse? - [ALEXIS VOICEOVER] You are not Trask. - [KEYPAD CLICKING] - Who are you? - [SENT MESSAGE WHOOSHING] - [MESSAGE VIBRATING] - [TRASK] Trask. What the fuck? Got your number off Mia's contact sheet. You are so my thing. [MESSAGE VIBRATING] I'm waiting. [EERIE MUSIC] [DOOR SQUEAKING] Trask? [FAN SCREECHING] [GRUNTS] What am I doing? [MESSAGE VIBRATING] [TRASK] Nice catch, sir. Bring my mask and a couple of zip ties and meet me on the other side of the lake. [KEYPAD CLICKING] [GORE VOICEOVER] Trask? [MESSAGE VIBRATING] [TRASK] Duh. [KEYPAD CLICKING] [GORE VOICEOVER] How did you get my number? [SENT MESSAGE WHOOSHING] [MESSAGE VIBRATING] [TRASK] Contact sheet. Not as bright as you are handsome. [KEYPAD CLICKING] [GORE VOICEOVER] That's a mildly creepy request. [SENT MESSAGE WHOOSHING] [MESSAGE VIBRATING] [TRASK] Creepy equals sexy. Keep on the DL, duh. [MESSAGE VIBRATING] Hurry. [TENSE MUSIC] [UPBEAT MUSIC] [MESSAGE VIBRATING] [TRASK] You're on the pill, right? [KEYPAD CLICKING] [ALEXIS VOICEOVER] No, but it's not an issue. - [KEYPAD CLICKING] - Yep. - [SENT MESSAGE WHOOSHING] - [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [MIA GASPING] [KEYPAD CLICKING] -[MIA VOICEOVER] Boo, can you pick me up some grapefruits ASAP? Gore failed. - [SENT MESSAGE WHOOSHING] - [MESSAGE VIBRATING] [INSTAGRAM] AlexisG77 posted to #MiaCampWedding. [KEYPAD CLICKING] Hey, what's with the scary selfie and where are you? [EERIE MUSIC] [SENT MESSAGE WHOOSHING] Gore, Go... What the fuck? - Shit. - What's wrong? Where's alcoholic girl? [FLYNN GROANING] [OMINOUS MUSIC] [GRUNTING] [GROANING] Flynn? Ah. [GRUNTS] [SPRAY HISSING] [TOILET FLUSHING] Hey. Definitely wheat-based vodka, sorry. It's quite the shit show. Did I wake you guys? We're the only ones left in the cabin. Why would she sully up my feed with this? - Aye. - [EILEEN LAUGHING] I'm just going to say what we're all thinking. This is not a selfie. Someone else took this pic. Someone psychopathic. That's what we're all thinking? [EILEEN SCOFFS] Alexis used to be goth, okay? She's probably just doing some like bachelorette - haunted house thing. - Is this her stuff? Hey, that is her stuff. Come on. I'm looking for a clue. [PILLS RATTLING] - Jackpot. - Wait, no. - These are prenatal vitamins. - [EILEEN SCOFFS] Do you think she's pregnant? Uh, she refused that beer. That's a first. Or she's trying to get pregnant. Maybe she was cheating with the psychopath and she thought he was a full- service sperm donor until... [SCREECHING] Oh my God. Okay. Let me just go check the boys' cabin in case they're not sleeping. [PILLS RATTLING] - [WATER SPLASHING] - [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [MESSAGE VIBRATING] [TRASK] Where are you? Starting to not feel this. [OMINOUS MUSIC] [WATER SPLASHING] [DOOR CREAKING] [MIA] Boo? [FLYNN] Where are they? - Oh, I asked him to run an errand. - [FLYNN] Now? Oh, he picked up my dress after the bachelor party. I'll be right back. [DARK EERIE MUSIC] [MIA] You guys at the store? Alexis posted this. Can't find her. Is Trask with you? [TRASK] Jack, where are you? [VOICE ECHOING] [OMINOUS MUSIC] [MESSAGE ALERT DINGS] [MIA] You guys at the store? Alexis posted this. Can't find her. Is Trask with you? - Is this happening? - [KEYPAD CLICKING] [EERIE MUSIC] Hey. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [GRUNTS] Jesus! [DALVERO VOICEOVER] Yeah, boo, be back in a jiff. I'll text him to look for Alexis. And is Gore not into Jack or what? [SENT MESSAGE WHOOSHING] [TENSE MUSIC] [MESSAGE VIBRATING] [TRASK] Come deeper into the woods, put on the mask, and zip tie yourself to a tree. I'll find you. [CANOE SCRAPING] [MESSAGE VIBRATING] [MIA] Man of honor, need you. Where are you? [EERIE MUSIC] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Alexis's phone must've just died. And your best gay? Caustic drunk girl. What was it, a phone massacre? [MESSAGE ALERT TINKLING] [INSTAGRAM] Gore&More posted to #MiaCampWedding. Trask is flaunting his conquests. Trask? Who was everything to Gore. And whose genetic makeup would you want for a child? -[FLYNN GRUNTS] He's some nympho psycho, so bathed in unexamined privilege. This is just sport to him. Well, that's an airtight theory. Gore was acting pretty desperate though. And prenatals? She wanted a baby bad. They could both be out there still alive just bleeding out somewhere. How are you even getting service? I've been trying to text Scott all night. We need to call the police. Man of honor fail is an inside joke and Gore was probably in on the prank. We'll just wait for them to scare me and then I will kill them. - You're not looking to come with us, are you? - No. I should stay with my friend here. Are you going to be okay? [KNIFE CLINKING] I'll be fine. [DOOR CREAKING] [CRICKETS CHIRPING] Alexis! Gore! Shh, turn that thing off. We need to be stealth. Okay, I can't see. Your eyes will adjust. [DOOR CREAKING] - [EILEEN SIGHING] - Coast is clear. While we're here, we could just finish the... Stealth. People are coming tomorrow. - To a blood bath. - [MIA SIGHS] [FLYNN VOICEOVER] Recovering from an accidental glutening. Hydration is key. Reach for electrolyte-rich beverages such as coconut water. [GRUNTING] [CAP CLATTERING] - [MESSAGE ALERT TINKLING] - [FLYNN GULPING] [SCOTT] He didn't make it. So sorry. [FLYNN SPITTING] [PANTING] [FLYNN CRYING] [MESSAGE ALERT TINKLING] [MAN] You're next.

Are you okay? Amazing. What are you doing out here? I needed some fresh air. You? I, uh, gave the best man shrooms to calm his nerves, but it freaked him out and now I can't find him. You gave him shrooms to calm his nerves? [SIGHS] For tomorrow not like right now. You don't have any pot? I thought that would have been better right before his speech. So you do have pot. [MATTRESS RUSTLING] Oh, maybe we could smother Trask with one of these. ♪ Oh oh oh oh ♪ Oh, is that how you yawn? [BINDER THUDDING] You're like a big opera singer now, right? - I love that #whatadivadoes. - Thanks. I just looked at your profile every once in a while - to see what you're up to. - [TENSE MUSIC] Yeah, sorry about not accepting your friend request yet. I just got really busy with the wedding, so, you know, haven't had... [GASPS] Oh my gosh. This camp is so adorbs and so un-PC. "Retarded"? What decade did these kids come from? [MIA] I don't know. I think they haven't had campers for a while. [DALVERO] At your cabin. Where you at? Oh my gosh. This could be a trap. We should get Flynn's knife and take one of these mattresses. [MESSAGE ALERT DINGS] [PAULETTE] If you're afraid to talk about this wedding, it's obviously a mistake. [KEYPAD CLICKING] [MESSAGE ALERT DINGS] [MIA] Eileen's cray.

How to Be Your Best Diva. Email's really the best way to reach me. #whata... [KEYPAD CLICKING] - [TRASK] Dalvero's totally sprung for that girl. - [PAULETTE] Mm-m. He wouldn't even go in the vicinity of a strip club. [SIGHS] That's not sprung. - That's whipped. - [MESSAGE ALERT BEEPING] Am I interrupting something? No, um, no. So what are you doing right now? Getting some fresh air, remember? [TRASK CHUCKLING] I'm going to show you something. [PAULETTE GRUNTS] Fucking hell. Fucking outdoors, right? [BRANCHES CRACKING] [FABRIC RIPPING] Shit.

Are you high? Either Trask or your husband-to-be or both or someone else is killing everyone. But we haven't found a body. That's beet juice. - [EILEEN SCOFFS] - [OMINOUS MUSIC] Everyone is missing. We need to find a landline and call 9-fucking-1-1. Unless you want to deliver your vows to a room full of coffins. If you would like to explain creepy selfies to 9-1-1, be my guest. I'm going to go find Dalvero and I'm going to sort this whole thing out. - I don't want you to die! - Oh, you're wrinkling the dress.

You're the one who disappeared for hours clearly to set traps for us. Are you even gluten-free? I have celiac disease. What did accomplice do to my son? [GRUNTS] Do you even have a child?

I don't really want to know how long so please don't tell me. But seriously I'd do anything for her. I know you would, too. I mean, if you were straight, you would probably be marrying her. So, yeah, I feel some competition there but I also think of you as a friend. I hope you think of me as one, too.

JFK's wound was pretty visible. I fired a warning shot into the air. This is weird. Maybe the same thing happened to Dalvero. I didn't kick him that hard. Do the selfies mean you're dead? I should have texted him. Adorable but people are dying without visible injuries. Alexis didn't have any either. You found Alexis? I got a text from a 510 number and it said, "Don't tell anyone and hide the body or there'll be more." Wait, you never gave me your phone number for the contact sheet and Dalvero has a 510 number from Berkeley and you probably do, too. I got the same exact text after Trask croaked on top of me except from a 617 number. Aren't you originally from Boston, Mia? No, Eileen texted me, "You're next," and she's the one with the Polaroid camera. I don't have your number. We all got the contact sheet. [SCOFFS] I'm not that organized.

I don't think he's alive. - This is supernatural. - [PHONE BUZZING] Oh, that explains everything. The paranormal always explains everything. He probably just got knocked out, came to, and... Is really engrossed in a "New Yorker" article? Mia, I did a background search on the camp and all of the permits were expired. - Did you book it or are we just trespassing? - I am not that cheap. And if they are out of date, I'm going to ask Miriam for a discount. Who's Miriam? The Airbnb contact for the camp. And the name of the girl who was struck by lightning and drowned? - Convenient. - You think that she's capable of being behind all of this? Shit, that's her last name and her profile picture was the camp sign. [SCARY MUSIC] - I've seen that Walkman. - [PHONE BUZZING] Her spirit is probably entrancing through his phone and made him a slave. Maybe if you take it away, it'll sever the tie.

[OMINOUS MUSIC] Yeah, that would've been a red flag for me. Oh my gosh. Look who's on top of the board. The last camp director was this psych grad student who, according to this very creepy website, pitted the kids against each other through some like disciplinary game. We've got to save her from his ghost. You break a rule and, bam, you're on the board. Mmm, but we all broke camp rules. I did. I drank, did drugs, I had sex, well kind of. Yeah, and the camp director's not dead. Well, fuck. Let's play the tape. Oh yeah. [EILEEN SIGHS] [LIVELY MUSIC] ♪ Don't toy with me to love ♪ [TENSE MUSIC] [MAN] To live a life free of sin, it is not enough to follow the rules. The moral and just answers to life's difficult questions lie within you and you found ways to ignore and twist them, to serve your selfish desires but deep down, you know what is correct. "JAMES 4:17," If you do not do what you know is right, you have sinned." Now, excuse me, is that a tape recorder? [MIRIAM] Director McFuffer, my parents said I had an exception. I record everything so I can study it later and get it perfect. [DIRECTOR] There are no exemptions at Camp Pocumtuck. Electronic devices will not be tolerated. Your parents warned me about your lies. Your selfish desire has twisted - your moral truth. - [TOMAHAWK WHACKING] That's makes you our first addition to the Board of Sin. If you do not do what you know is right, your picture goes up here. What's your name? [MIRIAM] But I'm not lying. They told me that... [DIRECTOR] What's your name? Miriam Kleingeist, sir. [DIRECTOR] Step up here, Miriam. [CAMERA CLICKING AND WHIRRING] The only way to get off the Board of Sin is to report a sin. What the Nazi Germany fuck? [DIRECTOR] Do you have a sin to report, Miriam? -No, sir. How does he expect to police the reporting of other's sins especially when the incentive is so high to report a false sin? [DIRECTOR] Reports of false sin just to get off the Board of Sin, is the gravest sin of all and God will tell me if you do something so heinous. -[MIRIAM CRYING] Stop it, stop it, stop it! Miriam, I'll need to be confiscating that. So everybody who was zombied just didn't do what they knew was right? - [KEYPAD CLICKING] - [TENSE MUSIC] [ALEXIS VOICEOVER] Yep. - [EERIE MUSIC] - [CAMERA CLICKING AND WHIRRING] Cheating, okay sure. But man of honor fail, unprofessional. I don't know, that stripper, man, he could have saved us but he decided to save his own ass instead. And also Gore forgot the grapefruits. I highly doubt it was the grapefruits. He probably got an ultimatum text just like Trask and even he had to know that cheating on his wife to get VP is just, - you know, fucked up. - [THUDDING MUSIC] Wait a flippin' second. [TENSE MUSIC] It wasn't the camp director that pitted the kids against each other. It was the drowned girl. She needed a sin to report - to get off the board. - [THUDDING MUSIC] But she reported like six sins and she's still on the board. [SIGHS] Because the religion Nazi camp director has to approve it. We need to open up a channel to her spirit and then call the camp director... But the camp director is in prison according to the website. Well, all that matters is that she believes it. One of us can pretend we're the camp director and let her know she's off the hook. Or we could pretend to be God and tell her to go to hell. How hard is it to open a channel? WikiHow, don't fail me now. [PHONES BUZZING] Circle of salts, silver amulets, blessed prayer shawls, serpents? Where are we going to source all this stuff? We can improvise.

I don't like the lake. Stop, I'm scared! They were so mean. I just wrote the notes. I didn't make 'em do anything. I'd never been in trouble before. Did it ever occur to you that maybe your parents just didn't tell them about the exemption? Take me back to camp or I'll report your sin right now. What sin? Lying. You did sleep with Dalvero. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [PAULETTE] Do you have proof? November 15th, 2008. It's in your MS Word journal and you wrote - a lot of poetry about it. - Wow. I was just starting to warm up to you. It was undergrad and I was a virgin and I didn't tell him and he freaked out midway through so defining it as full-stop sex is like a stretch, okay? It was awkward and then we became friends and I have a hard time making and keeping friends so this wedding felt like the death nail. So sue me for not being totally honest. You lied, too. Who? Both of you. [DOOR THUDDING] [DARK EERIE MUSIC] [PAULETTE] No! We can't help you if we're dead. - [DRAMATIC MUSIC] - [PHONE BUZZING] [MIA] Oh! [ZOMBIES GROANING] We could swim. [TENSE MUSIC] Oh, that's why you failed Quantico. It's a phobia. Miriam, I have a sin to report. You don't have to trick anyone. Maybe that'll get you off the board. What? Mia, I knew the email was a mistake but I wanted to force a fren-a-ssance. -Um... And exploit your opera fame to get my career back on track. But I really think we connected and not because you're just teaching. But I knew the right thing to do was to ask you if it was a mistake and I didn't. Sinner. [OMINOUS MUSIC] - [ZOMBIES GROANING] - [PHONES BUZZING] Fuck, it didn't work. Maybe you all have to do it? Uh, I didn't send the stay away from the wedding email. Seriously? Do you just want your friends and family to show up to this shit storm in case we pull off an eight-way exorcism. Oh my God. So this isn't just my wedding, okay? It's an audition for a wedding-planning position at Bride Boheme. My opera career is over. Okay, fine, it never even started. I just started lying about it on social media but... I have to do something with my life. I can't just be somebody's wife. Wow. Send the fucking email! - [EMAIL WHOOSHING] - [OMINOUS MUSIC] - [ZOMBIES GROANING] - [PHONES BUZZING] What more do we have to do? I, I cannot die! Oh, duh, full ceremony. What? No, no, no. [EILEEN] Say cheese. - [PAULETTE GRUNTING] - [CAMERA CLICKING] - [PHONES BUZZING] - [ZOMBIES GROANING] [OMINOUS MUSIC] We could still swim. Miriam forced Paulette's sin out of her, but not yours. - No, no, no! Fuck. - [DRAMATIC MUSIC] - [CAMERA WHIRRING] - [ZOMBIES GROANING] Um, sorry, that job at Bride Boheme, that's all me. - But you didn't cause our email mix-up. - I, yeah. That was me, too. [ZOMBIES GROANING] When I was ten years old, I stole a chocolate milk from the liquor store. - [PHONES BUZZING] - [ZOMBIES GROANING] And I set a cat on fire and I blamed it on neighbor boy and he went to juvie and I knew it was wrong. [EERIE MUSIC] No! You have to sin at the camp. [OMINOUS MUSIC] [PHONES BUZZING] Am I supposed to report myself? Ugh. Maybe I lied about the electronics exemption. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] - [ZOMBIES THUDDING] - [METAL CLANKING] [CAMERA WHIRRING] [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [BIRDS CHIRPING] [SCOTT] He didn't make it, so sorry. Maybe we can apply to that preschool in Carol Gardens? [BOSS] You're fired. Kidding. You need a vacation. Shit! That was meant for Dax. We were going to surprise you turning the brew room into a nursery and then he got tickets to the Yankees' game but totally doing it next weekend. [QUEENA] Toxic gas? I hope you're all okay. No worries. -[ANNIE] We're staying away in our rental car. - [TODD] Did you try Gas-X? - Smirk. - [MESSAGE ALERTS BEEPING] - [MESSAGES VIBRATING] Is everyone alive? [DALVERO GRUNTS] Okay, Mia, I mean, she's totally great. I approve. Can we just be friends again? Jefferson's alive. Oh! [GIRLS SCREAMING AND LAUGHING] - Alexis, are you pregnant? - I didn't want to upstage you. - Stop, that's amazing! - [GIRLS SCREAMING] - Boo? - Boo. Oh my God, my dress. [BOTH LAUGHING] 25 minutes? Deal? Why is it daytime? [MESSAGE ALERT DINGS] [WATER SPLASHING] [CANOES THUDDING] Hey. Hey. [GRUNTS] [SIGHS] Okay, phone time over. - Let's make this wedding happen. - But nobody's coming. If you actually love each other, does it matter? And you have a pretty strong case to contest your Airbnb fees. You can use the money to throw a party in the city for the obligatories. And I can probably Molly Ringwald this into something. What about Bride Boheme? Oh, it's okay. [BIRDS CHIRPING] Paulette is actually right. If we're going to have a wedding, we should do it because we love each other and we have really great friends. - [LIVELY MESSAGE MUSIC] - [OMINOUS MUSIC] - Oh my God! - [TRASK] What?
