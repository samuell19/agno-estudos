- This winter, Elegant Events invites you and your guest to the fabulous Swiss Alps for the ultimate celebration. An unforgettable evening begins as you enter through the magical crystal snowfall and are greeted with the finest champagne. I thought at this point, waiters could be standing by with frosted champagne flutes for the clients. - It's a lovely touch, Chelsea. And then? - And then they are escorted to the hotel's grand ballroom where we will create the splendor of a magnificent ice palace. - Is all of this in their budget? They're music executives, but it's a new company. They're just introducing themselves. - Yes, we're actually coming in under the budget they gave us. All of the numbers are here in the packets I provided in front of you. Oh, sorry. I'm sure the rest of the presentation is dazzling. But you seem to have everything well in hand here. And I need to take this call. - No, Trish, there's so much more. - I will look it over later. Who's the lead on the anniversary party in the Marina? Follow me. Do we have the final numbers on the yacht rental? - I worked so hard and I was just getting started. I didn't even get to the food, the entertainment. - Relax. We all know you're the best event planner at the company. - I just need Trish to approve of this pitch. - You have nothing to worry about. Trust me. - Well, we'll see. - No. I mean it. Do you wanna know how I know? - Uh, yes. - The new VP position? Events Development? Larry in the mailroom says you're a shoe-in. - Wait. Me? How does Larry know that? - He overheard Trish mention the position and your name in the same sentence. - Vice President? Oh, wouldn't that be something? - And well-deserved after all the big events you've created for this company? - Aw... - Chelsea? Do you have a minute? - Of course. - Privately? - Oh. Told you so. - Hello. - This ice palace presentation is remarkable. I hope you know that. - I'm so glad you approve. - They will love it or I will resign and put you in charge of the company. Kidding. I'll be doing this until I'm 100. But I can always depend on you. You are such a valuable player in this organization, which is why... - Yes? - I would like you... - Yes? - To welcome our new hire when he comes in from Boston next week. Show him around. Bring him up to speed on our procedures. You've heard of Danny Abernathy? - Uh, yes. He spearheaded the Metropolitan's Christmas Gala. - Mm-hmm. He's been on everyone's radar for months, but we got him. So take him under your wing, will you? - Sure. Is that all you wanted to ask me, Trish? Just out of curiosity, what position is he getting? - He will be our new Vice President of Events Development. I know it's a lot to jump into and I thought, if anyone can bring him up to speed, well, who better than Chelsea Whitmore, hmm? - Right. No, who but Chelsea. - Mm-hmm. Great. - You have got to be kidding me! You didn't get the promotion? Oh, Chelsea, I'm so sorry. - Maybe it's a sign. In a long list lately. At first I break up with Bryce, and then the rent hike at my apartment, the car trouble. - You've had a rough year. - And it's only January. - Garden salad? Ranch on the side? - Right. The usual. Thanks. - Oh, this came for you. I signed for it. Looks important. It's my Uncle Grady. - In Colorado? I thought you told me he passed away. - He did, a couple of months ago. But it says here that he left something for me. It's a deed. To a chalet in Vail! - He left you a chalet, a whole chalet? - The last time I saw him, I was graduating high school. - Oh, Chelsea, this is gorgeous. - Oh, I feel terrible. I mean, every winter he asked me to visit. But with work, I just... there was no time. And now this? What do I do with it? - Rent it, sell it, loan it to your best friend? - You know what? Maybe this is the real sign. You know what I've realized? I... sorry. I've made work my life. 24/7, day after day, the same thing. - Here we go. - Thanks. - I mean, look at this. I have a "usual". I never thought of myself as a "usual" type. - You could switch dressings. - This is bigger than a salad, Vienna. This is my life. It's going nowhere. Something has to change. Trish? - Yes? - Do you have a minute? - Sure. You quit? - I quit. I'm turning in my apartment key, filling the gas tank and I'm heading north. I already set the GPS, I checked weather conditions. I've even planned out stops along the way. - But you're giving up everything! The job. Your paycheck? Can you afford to do this? - I can't afford not to. If I stay, there will always be another Danny Abernathy skipping past me for a promotion. I mean, it's a matter of principle. I'll just take some time to consider my options and clear my head. And figure out what it is I want to be when I grow up. Maybe I'll change careers entirely. Maybe I'll start my own business. My life is a blank page. - You're actually good with that? - Good with it? No. I'm terrified. And isn't that exciting? - Wow... - First time in Vail? - How'd you know? - Call it a hunch. You planning on parking there? - Uh, shouldn't I? - I wouldn't. That's just me. You can do what you like. - Okay. Thank you so much for that. - Kevin will appreciate your business. - Who's Kevin? - Kevin is the tow truck driver here in town. - No parking? - Any time. - Well, you're parked. - There's a garage up the street. I'd say follow the signs, but they don't seem to be your thing. Just a block up, left then left again. - All the way up there? No, I'd rather find something in town. - Yeah, you could try. - Are you serious? Really? I mean, is this how you welcome everyone to Vail? Why can't I just go into town? - There's no driving in town. It's a pedestrian area. No cars at all, except, of course, for yours at the moment. - So I should move it. - Or Kevin can. Oh, there he is now. Hey, Kev! Welcome to Vail. - Uh-huh. Hi! What a cutie! Hi! Oh, what a good dog. Hi. - Willkommen. Welcome. I got that. Everything is so cute, so alpine. - You know, if you're thinking about lunch, you won't find a better burger. - Wow, half off, huh? - Best schnitzel in Vail. Ask anybody. Ask me. I own the place. - Well, you do have a very honest face and I will definitely try it while I'm here. But right now, I was looking for a grocery store. Just trying to stock the shelves for a few weeks. - You're staying a while. I hope you enjoy your visit. - Well, thank you. Certainly better than the welcome I just had. - Oh? Well, you're always welcome at the Edelweiss. Meanwhile, there's a nice little market down the next side street. Tell them Karl sent you. - I'll do that. Thank you, Karl. Phew. - Deliveries are in the showroom. Which shutter needed that new hinge? - The squeaky one, the one on the left. - Right. Really, Pop? Half price? - It's only for lunch. Prime tourist season. Gotta stand out, bring in the crowds. - You could give the food away for free. - If I thought it would help... - Schokolde-Lebkuchen... Spetzle... Spaetzle? - You look like you could use some help. - Oh, perfect timing. Yeah, I was just trying to find something I don't have to translate. Do you have any... - Oh, I don't work here. You just seem a little lost. - Oh. I'm sorry. I thought with the... what do you call your dress? - The dirndl? My uniform for my job around the corner, but if there's something you need... - I was just looking for pasta. - Um, one aisle over. - Perfect. - But as long as you're in the German section, you could try the spaetzle. It's really good. Eat like a local. - Is everything so Old World here? - Every part of Vail has its charm, West Vail, Lionshead, East Vail. This is the village. It's the original section, so it's more traditional. - Oh, so it's like a theme park, just without the rides. - We have those too, skiing, bicycles, ice skating. How long are you visiting? - I'm, uh... long enough to try this. - Well, if you don't feel like cooking someday, come around to the restaurant. The schnitzel's terrific. - Must be The Edelweiss. - You know it? - A nice man named Karl gave me the same pitch. - My boss, and he's right. Best in town. Ask for Molly when you come by. The Gluhwein's on me. - Well, thanks. What is that? - Spiced wine. You'll love it. - Oh. I bet I will. Thank you. Oh, that's cute. Hi. I hope I didn't keep you waiting too long. I made a grocery stop on the way. - Oh, not at all. We tend not to live by the clock around here. You're Chelsea. - Yes. You must be Beverly? - Oh, just Bev. Bev Hankins. - Great. Wow. So, this is it. - Three bedrooms, three baths, living room, den. Gorgeous views. Grady was so proud of the place. - Did you know him? - Oh, of course, I did. And he knew everyone. You know what a charmer he was? Yeah, that was Uncle Grady. Can I go inside? - Oh, got the key right here. The lawyer wanted me to meet you, show you around, answer any questions. After you. Welcome home. - What happened in here? - They didn't tell you? Your uncle was in the middle of having this place remodeled. - Oh, it's freezing! - Vail in the winter. We can fix that in no time. The heater must be acting up, but there's the fireplace. - Great. - I know the contractor. If you like, I can get him up here and back on the job in a jiffy. - Oh, that would be great. Really, as soon as possible. Please. Thank you. - I'm on it. - I caught him. He'll swing by in 10 or so. - That soon? - Oh, this is a small town. Everything's only a few minutes away. - Wow, that's just great. Thank you. - Chelsea, I have a showing I need to get to. But if you need anything while you're here, you call. And once you've decided what you're gonna do, keep it, sell it, rent it out... - I know where to find you. - Quite the change from Los Angeles, I imagine. Just a bit, yeah. Thanks again. Wow. Oh! Oh, that's great. All right. Let's make a fire. - Uh, one second! Uh... I'm coming! I'm coming! Hi. You must be the contractor... You? Really? - Do this for me? Looks like I came just in time. - Come in. Sorry to keep you waiting. The only room with clean water is the guest bathroom. - Yeah, we were in the middle of replacing those when... I thought you could use a fire. - I thought the same thing. It just didn't work out so well. - I noticed. Let's take a look at your heat situation. We, uh, turned this thing off the day that we left, it's a tricky model. Should replace it. - You are the last person I expected to see again today. - Or wanted to, I bet. So Bev tells me you're Grady's niece. - Chelsea Whitmore. - Owen Becker. I see you found a parking spot out front. - Yes, and there's no need to call the tow truck, if that's what you're planning. I know the owner. - Really? And who's that? - That would be me. - Oh. Okay, that should take the chill off. - So when you're not tormenting tourists during the day, you're also a delivery man and a contractor? - Among other things, yeah. It's a long story, but if you need work done, I can definitely do that for you. And you do need work done. Floors, walls, paint, pipes. What a mess, huh? - Weren't you doing the renovation? - Yep. - Oh. - But that all stopped when Grady passed. We all really miss that guy. But I don't need to tell you how great he was. - Yeah, I know. Uncle Grady was... he was one of a kind. - Hmm. - Can I... Can I show you something? - Mm. - Just out here. He had this telescope with this inscription, "Look to the Stars". - Yeah. He was crazy about astronomy. One of his favorite things in the world was to sit out here on a clear night and watch the universe fly by. Look, I think we got off on the wrong foot. - You think? - And some of that may have been my fault. - You know what, let's just compromise. Let's just say it was all your fault. - I like my version better, but we can go with that if that keeps the peace. - Well, you know, since we're gonna work together and all. - Okay. So you'd like me to tackle this job? - Yes. I don't really have a choice. I can't do it myself and I can't live here without fixing it. So I really have no other choice. I also just quit my job, so I'm not exactly sure how much I can afford. - Oh, don't worry about that. Grady already paid for all the materials. We can work out the labor cost. It won't be much. - Great. Deal? - Deal. - When can you start? - Uh, first thing tomorrow. I've got an extra guy. So we should get you up and running in no time. Does that work? - Yeah, but let me just check my... Just check my phone. - Something wrong? - I don't have my phone. I don't... That's just so strange. I have been on this mountain for a day. And I don't know if I have an email or a text or... I have no schedule. I have no meeting to run to. - That's a good thing, right? - I don't know. For the last five and a half years, I have planned someone else's schedule down to the millisecond. I didn't even have a spare second for myself. So I guess I'm gonna have to find out who I am when there's nothing on the calendar. - Well, Vail's a perfect place for that. And I'm gonna guess that you're not gonna eat here tonight. - No. Do you have any suggestions? - Yes. The best restaurant in town, perfect place to sign a peace treaty. - All right. I'm just gonna grab my phone. - Okay. - And change my sweater, since it's covered in soot. - Okay, this must be what the inside of a cuckoo clock looks like. - I have never thought of it that way. But that is exactly right. It's about as authentic as it gets. - Do you eat here often? - I have to. My father owns the place. I help out here when I'm not busy with remodeling jobs. - You came! Good to see you again! - Hi! - Do you two know each other? - Do you two... Dad, this is Chelsea Whitmore. She's hiring me to finish the remodel up at Grady's chalet. - I'm his niece. - Well, any niece of Grady's is a friend of ours. Oh, wait. Molly? Molly, you got to meet-- - Hey, Molly. - Hi again. - How have you been in town for one day and managed to meet everybody in Vail? - No, no, just the important ones. - Oh, and that's Vail's finest entertainment over there. That's fine for now, Hans. You can take your dinner break. Molly, will you tell the chef to prepare our special schnitzel for our special guest? - But you're the chef, Karl. - Well, then I guess I'd better get busy. Excuse me. Pick a table. There's plenty available, unfortunately. - I'll get that wine I promised you. - Thank you. - Oh, let me get this for you. - Oh. Well, thanks. - Of course. - So where is everybody? - Tourist tastes run toward the higher-end restaurants these days: fusion places, sushi, tapas bars, celebrity chefs. - They don't know what they're missing. - That's very kind. Don't ask me what's good here because I have to say everything. - All right. So what's good here? - Everything. - Wait a second. There's no strudel? - Mm-hmm. - Oh, sorry. I always look at the dessert menu first. It's just a bad habit. But I find that kind of odd, a German restaurant with no strudel. - That was Grady's specialty. Sorry to say, it's no longer on the menu. - Grady worked here? - Yeah. He and my father were best friends. They opened this place together. - And he was the cook? - The pastry chef. Grady's strudel was legendary, highlighted in all the guide books. There wasn't a tourist in town who didn't try it and come back for more. You don't seem to know much about the man. - To be honest, I, uh... we were really close when I was little. But, you know, as I grew up, and he moved away to Vail and I got busy with my career and... Yeah, I hadn't seen him in years and that's on me, I hate to say. - Mmm. - The things I missed. Frankly, I was actually surprised he left me the chalet. - I do remember him not being particularly close with his family. But, hey, sometimes it takes someone who doesn't really know you to really know you, you know. - Hm. I actually have no idea what you're talking about. - Yeah, I was going for profound. To be honest, I lost myself in there a bit. - Here we go. - Thank you. - Welcome to Vail. - Wow. Welcome to Vail. - Don't wait for me. Get started. - Oh, I won't. - So this can't be normal? Is this the way everyone travels around here? - I told Barry to take five. Can't have you walking all the way back to your car in the cold. - Oh. What, this sleigh was just handy? - What? This old thing? Just good timing. - Well, lucky us. - Lucky us. What, you see something? - Yeah, it's just the sky, the stars. You never see stars like that in Los Angeles. - There's no stars in I.A.? - No. Only on the sidewalk. With all those bright city lights, we're lucky if we can see the moon. - Right. So quiet here. Is it always like that? - Yeah. - Maybe that's what Uncle Grady liked about it. If it weren't so cold, so far away from everything. - Yeah, there's not a coffee shop on every corner. But some people think there's plenty to appreciate. - Oh, I didn't mean that... - It's okay. I know. - My car's around the corner. So I should... It's parked legally. - Good. Nicely done. So tomorrow, first thing? - Yeah. Whatever time is good for you. - First thing. - Okay. Thanks. - Wait. You're not planning on staying up there tonight, are you, with all that needs fixing? There's plenty of good hotels. - No. One night of roughing it won't kill me. I mean, it's like camping out, not that I've ever done that, but... - Hold on. You've never camped before? - Okay, and goodnight. - Okay. Goodnight. - Oh! No heat? Oh, come on! That's great. All right, fix the heat, patch the walls, finish the floors. Check the plumbing. What else? Paint. Approve colors. Vienna! Oh, hi! What a wonderful sound! - My voice? - No, my phone ringing. It hasn't rang all day. I feel like I was going through withdrawals. - You're in Colorado, not Antarctica. - Oh, well, you check my thermometer and tell me the difference. Do you actually know the symptoms of frostbite or... - I really doubt you've been there long enough. So tell. How's the chalet? - It's, uh... it's different than I expected. My uncle was actually doing a remodel. - Oh, no. - Kind of starting to wonder if I made a big mistake. I mean, the village is adorable, it's absolutely adorable. But I kind of miss the traffic and crowds and noise. - Isn't that everything you wanted to get away from? - You know, I thought it was, but, Vienna, I'm serious. I have never heard so much quiet in my life. There's a creek a half mile away and I swear I can hear it from here, unless that's just another part of the plumbing that actually has just broken. Honestly, if it weren't for Owen... - Owen? - He's the contractor. He's helping to put the house back together... And that is all. - If you say so. - Look, what I need is heat and plumbing and... And a good electrician. Argh! - Chelsea? - Owen! Oh, no! Uh, I'm coming! I'll be right there! - Chelsea, it's Owen! - I am so sorry. I overslept. I never sleep this late. What time is it? - Six. - A.M.? - You said first thing. Yeah. In I.A., first thing means 10. - Rob? Chelsea. Chelsea, this is Rob. - Hey. - Hi, Rob. - Heat off again. - Yeah, since last night. I banged on the thermostat. - That didn't work? That's strange. Rob, you wanna check the heat? - Yeah. - Here you go, Rob. - So what's the plan? - The plan? The plan is to fix all of the things. - What? In no particular order? - You have a preference? - No, no. I mean, you're the expert. But I did make a list last night of everything that needs attention. You'll see that on the first list, it's in order of importance. - I see that. - Yeah, and on the second list, it's room by room in a flowchart. I wasn't sure what you prefer. So... - This is so helpful. Thank you. Rob, you see how helpful this is? - Great, so where do you want to start? - Well, he's already going on the floor, so... - Oh, that's actually number seven. - I see that. Just... - Okay. - But he's already going, so... I'll slide seven up to one if that's all right. - Okay. - The heat's fixed. That's one. - Check. - Now let's get started on number two. - Plumbing. - Great! - Great. - Great. Rob, list is there if you want to take a peek. - It's alphabetized. You know. Great job. - Brought you some hot chocolate whenever you're ready for it. - Thank you. - Is there anything I can do to help? - Uh, no, no. Your lists were more than I could ever hope for. - Come on. There has to be something. - Uh, yeah. Why don't you come over to the sink? Turn the water on when I tell you. - Wait. Do what? - Turn the water on. No! Off! Off! Off! - What, what, what? Oh, no. - When I tell you. - Too soon? - I don't know, maybe a little. - Sorry. Really sorry. - That's okay. - I'm just gonna go outside. - Okay. - Yeah. - Oh. - You know, you don't have to hide out here. - Oh, I'm not hiding. Feel like I'm in the way in there. Out here, I can get work done. - Lists, schedules. Lists of possible schedules? - Research actually. Yesterday was nice, but I didn't get anything done. I've set the mornings aside to look for new opportunities. - What'd you do back in I.A.? - Event planning. - Really? - Splashy parties, you know, corporate clients. But I have to stay organized. Otherwise, I don't get anything done. - Mm-hmm. - So research until noon, 30 minutes for lunch. And then job applications until three. - Do you set any time aside to relax, stop and smell the pine trees? - This afternoon, yeah. 4 to 5. - Oh. - Although it's, I mean, it's flexible. - Good. For a second there, I thought you were being rigid. You know, there's a lot to do in Vail. An hour might not cut it. - Like what? - Skiing if that's your thing. - I'm not really a skier, no. - Okay. Skating? Day spas? - Uh-huh. - Adventure Ridge? - Adventure Ridge? What's that? - It's a gondola that goes to the top of the mountain. There's tubing back down. - That sounds like fun. - Yeah. - Can anybody do that or... - Of course. There's no experience necessary. Rob and I are gonna head up there later. You're more than welcome to join. - I mean, I don't know if I have the right... the right clothes. - Just layer what you got. There's plenty of places in town if you want to do some shopping while we keep at it up here. - All right, yeah. I might find time for that today. - Or you can go now. It's a beautiful day. Stores are open. - Are you trying to kick me out? - No, never. Trying to kick you into town. Go enjoy! And I'll see you at the gondola at 5:00. - Hey! - Hey! Looks like somebody found a ski shop. Very nice. - Thank you. At least I'll be warm. Okay, this place is unbelievable! - Yeah. Good place to unwind. - So where's Rob? - He went on ahead. Weren't sure you were coming. - Oh, so it's just you and me? - Am I not good enough? Want to back out? - Nah, not a chance. Is this the only way up? - You good with heights? - I work in a skyscraper, or I did. It's just skyscrapers don't sway. - Come on. You'll like it once we get up there. - Okay. - It's gonna be a fun ride to the top. You okay? - Okay. Better than I thought. - Okay, good. - It's kind of fun actually. - Yeah. People come up here year-round. Wait until you see in the spring with the wildflowers. - If I'm still here. - Oh, yeah, right. If you're still here. - I mean, this is only temporary. My life is back in California or New York probably. - Well, life is wherever you are, isn't it? - Yeah, my business life. - Well, I'm no event planner, but couldn't you do that anywhere? - You have to go where the prospective clients are, film studios, record companies, celebrities. What about you? Are you always a contractor and a parking inspector? - No. No, I went to school for architecture. You know Grady's deck? I designed that thing. - Really? - Yeah. - Wow. It's beautiful. Why don't you do more of that? - Well, you know what they say. Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans. Around the time I graduated, Vail changed a lot, trendy cafes, celebrity chefs. My dad couldn't keep up. It got to the point where he was barely holding on. I thought he should sell. I still do. But it can't be my decision, you know? So as long as he needs me... - You're here to help. - Yeah. At first, the idea was to do some general contracting to make some quick money to supplement what the restaurant brings in, help out where I could until things turned around and I'd go back out on my own. - It just hasn't worked out that way? - No, it hasn't. But if business doesn't pick up, my dad is forced to sell, it'll break his heart. - Oh, I'm so sorry. - That's okay. It's just life. Anyways, we're almost at the top here. We're gonna do some serious tubing. You ready? - No, not ready. - You better get ready. It's about to get intense. - What do you think? - Wow! This is the most beautiful place I've ever seen! But wait. Is that what we're here for? - No backing out now. - Oh, my. - I was afraid I gave up on you. Glad you made it. - Hey. Hey, Molly. - Hi. - So, what are the instructions? What do I do? - Nothing to it. Just settle in and hold on. - I'll be right next to you. - You'll be fine. - All right, come on. Let's go. - Are you sure about this? - I'm sure about this. - Well, I don't know about this. - Watch your step. - Woo! - Wait! How... how do we steer? - You don't. Just put your trust in the mountain. - What...? - Just come on. Let's sit down. - I mean... - You got it? - Trust it? - Just sit. - I barely know it. That doesn't make sense! - Here we go! Yeah! - Oh, my gosh! - You having fun? - Oh, I am! I really am! I hate to say, it's been a while. - What's a while? - Just a long while for too many things, you know. - Yeah. - Like this. - Don't start something you can't finish. - Oh, I'm gonna finish it. I'm gonna finish it. - I got a shield! You're in the open! - Patricia? Hi. It's Chelsea Whitmore. Yes, your company's Christmas Party, exactly. I remember you had mentioned to me that your wedding anniversary was coming up. And I was just wondering if you had hired anyone to organize that for you yet. - Hey, we're here! - Because-- - Sorry. - It's okay. - Pastries if you're want. - No. I'm no longer with Elegant Events. It would just be me. Colorado, but I can... Oh, yeah, no, of course. I understand. Happy anniversary. Good morning, guys. - Sorry to interrupt. How's the networking going? - Oh, nothing yet. A little harder than I thought. - Well, I got some good news for you. We should be wrapped up here today. And all you gotta do is arrange your furniture and hang some pictures. - That's great. That's awesome. This is... are these from Edelweiss? - Yeah, those are your uncle's recipes. - Wow! It's amazing. - You should have tasted his strudel. - Where's the recipe for that? - Gone. Grady had it memorized. - Hmm. I'm sure there are other strudels. - Yeah, most places have them, but Grady's was special. Once you have one of them, every other strudel is just strudel, you know. - It sounds like you guys need to find another dish, something else that people line up for. - That's a tough one. Easier to just sell and move on, you know. - Mm... Oh, it's looking good. - Thanks. You okay with the color? It's what Grady picked out. - I love it. Guess we had more in common than I knew. - He was very proud. He talked about you all the time: all your awards, your recitals, all your accomplishments. - I saw him every summer when I was a kid before he moved here. I always felt like we had a special bond. It's nice to know he felt the same. - Hey, is this Grady's star map? He's got all the constellations renamed. He used to love doing that. We got Kitty, Trudy... - Trudy. Trudy, that's my mom. Isn't that sweet? Yeah, they live in Cincinnati now, but they made it up here a few times. I'm gonna have to tell her to check the stars. - That's a cute picture. - You bake? - I don't remember baking. I found something else in here. I wanted you to have this. - What's this? This is Grady's apple strudel recipe. - What? - This is his recipe! - So now you can put it back on the menu. And it'll help get The Edelweiss back into black! - Well, it would take more than one dessert, I'm afraid. But, gosh, it's wonderful to have this. Thank you. You know, have you seen Arabelle Square yet? It's hard to find anything prettier this time of year. Why don't you let Owen show you around? I think Molly and I can handle the lunch rush. - Yeah, we should be good. Want something to eat? - Yes, please. - Sounds nice, if... you don't mind being my tour guide? - Are you asking me to skip work? - Yes. - Okay. Let's go. That was so much fun. Is there any part of this town that isn't beautiful? - No. No, not much. - You know, I don't know how you do it. - Do what? - Just between the restaurant, your father and wanting to help, and also move forward. I don't know if I could be that noble. - Oh, I am not that noble. I once pretended to forget my wallet just so Rob would have to pick up the check for once. Still haunts me to this day. - Right. I take back what I said. - Sometimes in this life, you meet good quality people. And you're lucky enough to be able to stand by them when they need you. My dad's one of those people. Your uncle was one, too. Jury's still out on you, though. - You know, I've been thinking about my uncle's strudel recipe and I want to try it. I want to see what all the fuss is about. - Yeah, sure. And how are we supposed to do that? - We can do it. We can make it. - We? We? - Yeah. - You and me we? - Yes! He's my uncle. Pastry's in my genes... maybe. We have the recipe. What time's the kitchen free tonight? Flour, salt, butter, raisins, oil, cider, lemons, cinnamon, sugar, apples, a rolling pin and baking sheets. - You sure this is a good idea? I can cook a steak, but that's about it. - A recipe is just a plan, and me? I'm all about plans. You, you like to build things. So here's the plan. Now let's start building. - Like a little poet. This? - Two cups of flour, please. - Yes, ma'am. - Half of the oil... Cider. Perfect. - All right. So we pick it up. Gentle... - Okay. Gently stretch. So, what do you think? - About what? - Is it thin enough? - Yeah, right. Uh, let's get the menu. - Lift it up. - Lift it up very, very, very gently. Edelweiss Restaurant. - You can read it. It's perfect. - I think it's perfect. - We did it. Grady would be proud. - Yes, he would. - Okay. - All right. - What's next? - Now we fill it, roll it and we bake it. - And then? - Strudel! - Strudel! - Okay. - Okay. It's got a good crust to it, just saying. - It's quite beautiful. - Off to a good start here. - Thank you. - Moment of truth. - Right. Here we go. - Cheers. - Cheers. - What do you think? - What do you think? - I think for our first try, this is incredible. - Yes! - Yeah? - I mean, it's no wonder it was so famous. If it's this good and we made it, can you imagine what your dad could do? - True. - Remember when you said how you needed something to make The Edelweiss a destination again, get it back in the guide books? - Mm-hmm. - So what if you did a huge promotion around this? It's the triumphant return of Grady's famous strudel? People love this sort of thing. Bring it back. Make a big deal out of it. Make an event, a festival or, you know, I don't know, something that is big, that'll draw attention. - What? Like a Strudelfest? - A what? - Strudelfest. - Is that a thing? - No. No, I just stuck the words together. - Oh, sure. Festival, right. Strudelfest. Huh. Hmm. - Hmm. - Strudelfest. Oh, I just can't get over how bright the stars are out here, just all those constellations. Where do you think Trudy is? - Trudy. I'd have to check Grady's map. But I do remember one thing he taught me. Where is it? Oh there it is. You see the bluish-white one? - Yeah. - You don't see it. - Yeah, I do. I'm looking at it. - This one right here. You see? - Yeah. - That's Vega, the goddess in love with the farm boy. The star Altair which is right over there. - Wait. The bright one? - Yeah, the star at least. The boy, I'm not sure. He might be dim. - So what happens? They just stay up there light years apart, they never get together? - Nope, not yet, but legend says maybe someday. - Ah, so there's hope. - Yeah, there's always hope. - Is there a Strudelfest? Hmm... Wait a minute. It is! It's a thing! Owen, you're not gonna believe this. - It's a big annual celebration, Pop. - Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, why not Vail? - We could do something like that here, reintroduce The Edelweiss, make a big thing out of it. - Yeah. Music and arts and crafts, and just all things celebrating strudel. - That sounds ridiculous even to me. Bev? - I think it sounds like fun! Will there be dancing? Did you know I love to dance? - Oh, dancing, yes. - We also want to do a contest. Best strudel in Vail open to everybody. Pop, if you're serious about getting The Edelweiss back in the new official guide books, they come out next month. - Well, you know, something like this could bring tourists back to all the village businesses. It's worth a try, don't you think? - It would be an event everyone's talking about. Can you please let me do this for you? - What? No, no, no, we couldn't ask you to do all that. - Of course, you can. This is what I do. Really, it's what I do. And you would honestly be helping me build my portfolio as well. - What do you got to lose, Pop? Come on. - You're right. - Is that a yes? - That's a yes. - Great! Good! This is gonna be spectacular! So a whole weekend of celebration all leading up to the contest. There'll be decorations everywhere. We'll make a big deal out of the strudel entries by giving samples to the customers. Oh, and I was also thinking that we should have a special menu for that night, like a fairy tale theme? - I could do that. - Okay, great. So I just need a list of all the shop owners in the village. Because we want everyone onboard. - Easy enough. What do we tell them? - It's all right there. - Oh, my goodness. When did you do this? - Earlier this morning. All right, so we just need to settle on a date. We should look at the calendar. Oh, oh, and the band. There has to be dancing. - I know Vail's finest entertainment. - Lots of room for Vail's finest. During the day, we'll have polka exhibitions in the street. And at night, there's the back room, space for dancing if we want. But we haven't used it in a while. Come take a look. Tell me what you think. - Hmm. - Okay, this is it. Started storing stuff back here a while ago. - When? 1930? - Nice. It's been a little busy. Space is good, though, right? - Yeah. Yeah, it will be. I can picture some chandeliers and maybe some twinkly lights in the corner and some cozy seating. Oh, we could set a judge's table right here. - Right. - Speaking of, we need judges, who do you know? Who's an expert? - Local chefs. I think we can get a few. - Okay, that's good. - Is this what you're like in Los Angeles? All take-charge like this? - I like to make things happen. - Yes, ma'am. - All right. First we gotta get some judges signed up. We need at least three. - If you want chefs, I know one we can start with. Bonus points, her restaurant is fun to get to. Come on! Left, right. - Oh, my gosh. - Left, right. It's like being in the Army. Look around! We're on a lake! - Wow! - But I mean, don't you do anything the normal way? - Sounds like a terrible way! I thought you'd get a kick out of this. - Where is this restaurant? - All right. See those trees up there? Just past them. - Okay. I'll race you! - I love it! I love it! - She's in the lead! - Go, go, go, go! You tired yet? - This is a workout! Well, now I can officially say I skied on a lake. - There you go. You've done it. Yes, there you go. Just dramatic walking. - Woohoo! Okay. - Not gonna let you win, though. - When I said race, it was just a friendly race. - All right, we're here. - All right, nice. So this place is on an actual road. Like we could have driven here? - Yeah, that's a fact. There's no fun in that. How's the fondue? - Oh, it's amazing. I'm making a mess... - You're throwing it everywhere. - But I haven't done this in ages. - Yeah, it's an alpine treat, especially the way Chef Frankie makes it. - Hey, Owen. I hear you wanna talk to me? - Yeah. Chef Frankie, this is Chelsea. Chelsea, Chef Frankie. - How's your lunch? - Oh, it's delicious. I mean, every bite is so good. - Well, when you finish there, we have a chocolate fondue you're going to love. - Wait. No apple strudel? - Sorry. Plenty of places offer it, but nobody makes strudel the way Grady used to, so why try? - Amen. Chelsea here happens to be his niece. - Oh? - And if you have a moment, we have a proposition for you. - Okay. - So it's a new thing for the village. Everyone's getting involved, the whole town. Strudelfest. - You're kidding. - Nope. - Nope. - You're not? Tell me more. - Okay, quiet, please, if I could get everyone's attention. Thank you all for coming. Pop, you wanna take it from here? - My friends, each and every one of you for so many years now, you know the changes in Vail these past few years, they've been wonderful. They've been wonderful, to be sure, but it does mean that we need to work that much harder to bring the tourists to our charming older section of town. - Which is why we want to introduce you all to a new friend who brought us an idea that could benefit all of us. Everybody, this is Chelsea Whitmore. Hi. Oh, thank you. I thank you all so much for coming. As you've heard, we are gonna be calling this concept "Strudelfest", a celebration of music, art and food everywhere in the village with the main attraction being strudel in all its variations. - What if each restaurant features its own version? Plum strudel maybe? - Strudel ice cream? Oh, I'm serious. I bet I could come up with that flavor in my shop, apples, raisins, cinnamon? - Or there might be a strudel cocktail? - These are all great ideas, great ideas. But it won't just be all about cuisine. It'll be a street fair highlighting local arts and crafts. You know, fun for the whole family. - Some music, local bands and singers. - Where's the money coming from? - Ah, yeah. It takes money to make money. Isn't that what they say? Most of it is donated time, creative thinking. As for the rest? - Each business will cover its own costs and share the price of banners and advertising and so on. Think of it as promotion, you know, investment in future sales. - And when would it be? - Oh, as soon as possible. I think we'd all agree that there's no time to waste, right? - And with your help, we can pull this together in two weeks. Now the main event will be a contest held here at The Edelweiss, open to everyone, judged by local experts, for the best strudel in Vail. - It's a clever idea. It's peak season, so the tourists are already here. - I've made a flyer and there is a signup sheet over there on the other table for those who want to participate. And I'll be here if you have any questions. And maybe... just maybe this will be the first annual Strudelfest. - You good, pop? - Yeah. - She's something else, isn't she? - You were great tonight, the way you took control of that crowd. - Oh, it's easy to sell something you're passionate about. - You're passionate about strudel, are you? - I am. I don't know how that happened. - Okay. Flip that switch. - Now? - Yes. - You sure? - Yes. - Because I remember the sink at the chalet. - I do, too. This time, it's fine. Hit that switch. - Look at that! It's perfect! - Yeah. So you really think we can get it all done this fast? - Yeah, of course. I once planned a retirement party at Dodger Stadium. I mean, fireworks, marching band, food, the whole thing in two days. - When you put your mind to something, you don't mess around, do you? - Yeah, you have to go after what you want in life. Can I ask you a question? - Yes, you can. - Is this enough? - What's that? - Fixing freezers and rewiring chandeliers? You're an architect. - I hear you. I'm doing what I like. - Yeah, but what about doing what you love? - Family comes first. Besides, it's been so long since I've done any of that. I might not even have what it takes. So for now, I do what I have to. But we have more important things to worry about. We need to focus, so we have got Chef Frankie at the Cabin Restaurant for a judge. - Yes, and we have a pastry chef from the hotel who signed up tonight. - That's two. - Any thoughts on a third? - One, and if we get her, it'd be a really big deal. - Right. Let's do that. - Everyone's talking about your festival. Maybe you'd like to include this. We could set up a booth. It's our version of hot chocolate here at The Sebastian. - Chef Laura has won pretty much every award there is to win for her desserts. - Oh, but it's just hot chocolate, right? - Easy. - It sounds simple, but wait. We start with shells. We fill them with Irish Crème marshmallows and chocolate crunch pearls. - Look at her. Like Rembrandt. - Very precise. - After that, we dust them with gold. - Wait, real gold? You're kidding. - She never kids. - Oh, and will you bring over that pot of hot chocolate? - Yes, Chef. - It's spiced with vanilla, cloves, anise, cinnamon, and cardamom. Chocolate globes in here. - And then the hot cocoa gets poured over that? - Exactly. - Here we go. - It melts through the chocolate shells and... - It's like magic. It's like magic. - Something else. - Have a sip. - Cheers. - To baby marshmallows. - To little tiny baby marshmallows. - Mmm. - Taste that? - I have never tasted anything like that ever. That is... that is winter in a cup! - I may have to use that on the menu. So what was it you were coming here to see me about? - Oh, um... Oh, what a day! Look at those pastries! - Yeah, I've been sitting here waiting you so we can dig in. The best part is we got our third judge, so we're all set, right? - Yeah. I just need to arrange bunting for the shop owners to really pull the theme together. - Do you ever stop? It's okay to take a break, you know. - Yeah, this is the only way to get things done. - Oh, I don't know if I believe that. I think you can get things done and still have a life. You might even enjoy what comes your way, like this absurd chocolate, for instance, these ridiculous pastries. Time with good people. - I should probably get that. - Yep, you could. - You know what? I can check it later. - Cheers to that. 400 more pastries, please. We got her now. She's taking a break. - Vienna! What are you doing here? - Thought you'd never get here. - Why didn't you tell me you were coming? - Oh, I wanted to surprise you. But when you weren't home, I texted. - Oh, sorry. That was you. I didn't even... I didn't even look at it. - Chelsea Whitmore didn't check a text? Do I even know you now? - Come here. It's so good to see you! - Can we go inside? I'm freezing. - Oh, I know. Yeah. - Is this your uncle? - Yeah. - Look how sweet you two were. And this place, you made it sound like a disaster zone. - Well, you should have seen it when I got here. Owen has been so helpful in pulling it all together. - Owen, huh? - Sit down and tell me why you're here. What's going on? Tell me everything. - Everything could take a while. - Well, start with why you're here. - Maybe I'm missing my best friend? - Vienna, come on. You just got a promotion. You have all this new responsibility. You're taking time off already because you miss me? What is up? - Oh... "Let me know ASAP. Trish." Let her know what? - Okay. She sent me. She thought you'd listen to me before you'd listen to her. But in my defense, I wanted to come anyway. The new guy, Danny, he's not exactly a team player. Insists on doing everything his way. - And we know Trish hates that. - Exactly. So when he almost lost us the symphony account... - He didn't. Are you serious? - Trish stepped in and smoothed things over. But now she's in a bind and she wants you to call her. - Don't tell me she wants me back! - Like tonight. Oh, Chelsea, she'll give you anything if you'll consider it. - Vienna, are you kidding? I mean, I've already told you. I made a commitment. - Strudelfest? - Yes, and I... honestly, I couldn't even think about Trish until after this weekend. - Then can I at least tell her that, please? I need to tell her something. And, hey, while I'm here, let me help you with this. Whatever you need, like old times. - Like old times. Like a few weeks go? - Okay, like recent times. It'll be fun. What do you say? - Cheers to old times. - It's like we landed smack in the middle of Europe. I love it. - I know, and the people are so great. Just wait. Hey! - Hey, Chelsea! What do you think? - Oh, you figured out the strudel ice cream. - Wait'll you taste it. The tourists are going wild for it. - You better save me a scoop. - Strudel ice cream? - Yeah. Everybody's just getting into the spirit. The coffee shop is doing a flavored creamer. The art gallery down the street is doing a special exhibition "Vail in Winter", it's paintings by local artists. It's gonna be awesome. - I have to admit when you first told me about this, I thought it was maybe the biggest, craziest idea you've ever had. - And now? - I think I was right. - Hey, Molly! This is Vienna, my friend from I.A. - Hi. - Nice to meet you. You approve? - Oh, it looks perfect. Is Owen inside? How's it looking? - Wait until you see. - Oh, great. Good. Good morning, everybody! Okay, we got more decorations for tonight. - Just what we need! Who's your friend? - Uh, Owen? Everyone? This is Vienna. She came in from I.A. to help us out. - Welcome, and thank you. - Karl, where would you like me to put the Belgian chocolate fountain? - Uh, ask Chelsea. - Maybe we should make that the centerpiece on the buffet. Want to help with that? - You got it. So that's Owen? - Everybody's confirmed and they're all gonna be here in three hours. - Is that really enough time? - You know what? That's the magic of these things. It seems, like, impossible, then somehow at the last minute, it just works out. - Where do you want the sound set up for the judging? - Oh, you know what? I'll show you. Owen, is the back room ready? - Yeah! Yeah, it is. - This... This looks amazing! - The guy did a great job. - Yes, he certainly did. Okay, sound system. Maybe we should put the sound system here. - I'll grab the equipment and get you set up. - Never had a chance to properly thank you for everything you're doing. - You don't have to thank me, Karl. This is the most fun I've had in years. If it helps the restaurant, then... - No. Not the restaurant. Not the town. For my son. - For Owen? - Yeah. He's given up so many dreams just to help me, not that I asked him, mind you. - I know. He, uh... He needs to make sure that you and The Edelweiss are okay. Family first. - Mm-hmm. Well, whether this works or not, it's his turn to come first. After tonight, we'll either make it or I'll sell knowing that we tried. But either way, I'm grateful. - It's my pleasure. Back to work. Great job on the menu, Molly. Enchanted Black Forest Cake, Red Velvet Writing? Like that is genius! This is just what we need to cap off Strudelfest weekend. - Thank you. - Okay. I think we are all set. We are just missing one thing. - Decorations, tables, guest list, judges. What could we possibly be missing? - Welcome to everything we need for our own entry, Grady's strudel. - Wow. Do we have time? - Haven't you learned anything since you've been here? In Vail, we keep our own time. But it wouldn't even be fair. I mean, it's your father's restaurant. - In the game of strudel, all is fair. It's an old mountain saying. - Mm-hmm, yeah, I'm sure. - What kind of celebration would it be if Grady wasn't represented? Let's do it for him. - Let's do it. Yeah, for Uncle Grady. - For Uncle Grady. Let's go! - This looks absolutely perfect! I can't thank you all enough for your hard work! - Tonight, with gratitude to all of you, but especially Chelsea, we've managed to put a spotlight back on this village. We put a spotlight back on The Edelweiss! - Pop? - What... - Let's open the doors. - Yeah. We'll do it together? - Uh, sure. - Willkommen! Welcome to Strudelfest! - Where should I put my strudel? Somewhere Karl will notice? - Is that your entry? - My mother's recipe. She always said it was the way to a man's heart. - Oh, any man in particular? Looks delicious. Follow me. - Make note of the numbers. People will vote for their favorites, and their votes will be added to those of the judges to determine tonight's winner. - Chelsea? - Oh, Laura, hi! Okay, I have been dreaming of your hot chocolate. - Thanks, Chelsea. Meet my friend, Helen. She owns the local bookstore. I've been telling her about you. - Oh, how lovely. Nice to meet you. Thanks for coming. - We're moving our shop to a larger location in the spring. And I would love it if you could do something like this for my business. If that's something you do? - Do I? Up here. Um... I, uh... Yes, yes, I do. And I would love that. - I'll expect your call. - Great. - Laura? Helen? May I escort you to the dining room? - Enjoy! - Did you meet Helen? - Yeah. - You should see her bookstore. It's the best. - She actually... wants to hire me to plan an event. How about that? - How about that? All right, enough running around. It's time for you to enjoy your party. Come on, let's go. - All right. - Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen! So it's kind of that time of the evening. The judges have had a chance to sample all the entries and they've added their votes to yours. At any moment now, we're gonna have a verdict. - We're gonna win. - Not a chance. Did you see the competition? What do you wanna bet? - One single dance. - You're on. - Okay. - Okay. Can we have a round of applause for all our pastry chefs? - Woo! - All of these were delicious, so you've made our job very difficult. But we're in agreement with all of you that the winner of the first annual Strudelfest is... Beverly Hankins! - Oh, that's just Bev of Elevation Realty in case anyone's looking to buy a new house. - This is so great. It'll be all over social media by tonight. And then Edelweiss will be on the cover of the next guide book. - I hope so. It's exactly what the restaurant needed. Would you look how happy Bev is? My dad, too. - But we did lose. You got to admit, I was right. - It was our second try. There's plenty of room for improvement. In the meantime, you owe me a dance. - But we didn't win. - Look around. The restaurant's full. People are having a good time. Vail Village is alive again. If that's not a win, I don't know what is. - Thank you. - Get ready for the worst dance of your life. You should see me ballerina moves. - Hello? Trish? - I don't remember the last time I enjoyed myself this much. My dad, too. Look at him. - They're the perfect couple. - I was thinking the same thing. Listen... I know you're still figuring out where life is taking you and I don't want to make that more complicated than it is. Look at the difference you've made here. I don't just mean the village. - It's funny how I had to run away to find myself. Yet here in Vail, it just feels like home. You feel like home. - I really, really hate to interrupt, but... - Vienna? - Please, for me? - It's okay. - I'm... - Sorry. - I'm so sorry. - It's all right. - So sorry. - It is work? Yeah? Okay. - Trish, this really isn't a good time. - I apologize, Chelsea, but you are taking to a desperate woman! - Vienna told me what's been going on. - Then you know! Elegant Events needs you back! I need you back, whatever it takes! - Trish... - I'm begging you, Chelsea. How did I let you leave in the first place? - I know what you're getting at, but I'm in Vail now and I like it. - It's a lovely place to visit. We can work another vacation into your new deal. I can make you vice president of something, whatever you want! - Are you serious? - Come back and we will work it out! A corner office, you name your salary. What do you say? - Trish, I'll call you back. - Okay, so you're leaving, but you're coming back? - I'm sorry. It's just this offer. I mean, it's everything I've worked for all these years. It's everything I've ever wanted. - Everything? - Yeah, and this is my job and that's where I can do it. I've... I've loved my time here. I really have and you're a huge part of that. I mean, it's been like this incredible dream but... Dreams aren't real, right? And... I don't know what happens when we wake up from this, but this job... - It's real, yeah. The job's real. I get that. - This was always supposed to be temporary. - If it's what you feel you want, then I'm happy for you. I mean that. - This is one of the hardest decisions I've ever made. - Then maybe it's not the right one. - But Owen, I know if I don't try, if I don't at least try, then I'll always wonder. - That's true. Okay, uh, that's that. You should know you've changed a lot of lives out here, including mine. Especially mine. Okay, safe trip. Let us know if you need anything. - Owen... - It's okay. Come and visit us. Congratulations. - Second thoughts? - No. It's the right thing. I was just trying to commit it all to memory. - It's beautiful. Owen did such a good job. - Yeah, he really did. I just wish Uncle Grady was still around to see it, you know, now that it looks like paradise and now that I'm leaving. - Some lucky buyer will surely snap this up. - I hope so. No, of course, we can handle that! I will take a red eye and be on the east coast Wednesday morning and supervise that myself. No, it's not too much trouble. It's what we do. I'll see you then. - This is Chelsea. Oh, Mr. Delacorte! I'm so glad it's you. Listen, regarding... Oh, I'm so sorry. If you could hold for just one second? Hey, Trish, what's up? - I'm just heading out to dinner, but here are a few of the balls Danny dropped. I know it's late, but some of them need immediate follow-up. Did you talk to the museum about opening night for the new exhibition? - Yes. I suggested a dozen local artists doing Picasso variations. - That's inspired! Did they love it? Of course, they loved it! We're so glad to have you back, Chelsea. It's as if nothing's changed, right? - Yes, nothing at all. - Goodnight. - You still here? Something wrong? - Oh, it's my hot chocolate. There's no gold flakes. - I have no idea what that means, but you're not in Colorado anymore. How's it feel? Big new office, beautiful view of the city. - Honestly, I've been too busy to even notice. - Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no. Mr. Delacorte? Hello? - You miss it, don't you? - What I miss is... the person I was in Vail, the slower pace, the people, Molly, Karl and Vail's finest entertainment. I miss brisket at The Edelweiss. I miss the snow and I... I miss the stars. - We have stars. - Yes, a few, but... Kind of hard to see with the bright lights. I miss real hot chocolate. - And Owen? I was wrong, Chelsea. You were the happiest I've ever seen you up there. If that's what you really want, you should go back. Get your life. It's still there waiting for you. - All right, I have so much work to do. - Okay. - Grady's world-famous apple strudel. We may not have won this year's Strudelfest, but next year, watch out. - Busy? - Nah, just playing with some ideas. I asked Chef Laura to introduce me to the owners of The Sebastian. I pitched them a concept for a brand new hotel wing. - Aha! My son, the architect finally! Such good news, and I have more. A guide to Vail, advance copy hot off the presses and we're in it again! - Wow. - Oh, look at all those stars! It even mentioned Strudelfest. - Oh, that's great! - You know, even without this, we've got a wedding planned for next month. And I just got off the phone with someone who wants to organize their class reunion here. - That's fantastic. It's too bad we don't have an event planner, huh? - About that, um... Owen, you're my son and I love you. But, sorry to say, you're not thinking clearly. - Okay. - Well, you're not. Geez, when it comes to love, Owen, that's what life is all about. You let it get away. - Dad... - I've lived. I know things. Look, you helped me through the hardest years of my life and I'm grateful for that. Time for you to make your own life. If you love her... - She's gone, Dad. It's too late. This is good, though. - It's something Bev made. - Mmm. - Spending a lot of time with me in the kitchen. I think we may have a new pastry chef, full-time. - Right, easy. Okay, okay. - Think about what I said? Oh, uh, speaking of Bev, she called this morning to remind you to pick up your tools from the chalet. It's been over a week. - I'll get 'em tonight, Pop. Hello? Hello? Anyone home? Chelsea? - Too many clouds tonight. I can't see the stars. They're still there, though, right? - Yeah. Yeah, they're still there. - Vega and Altair?
