I'm in charge of social media for our three teams and 96% of our followers are men. It's always been said, "If a girl races a bike she's crazy." There are many more men than women in the world of motorbikes. I'm one of the few female mechanics. If you see 35 people, you don't know their sex because of the helmet. You take it for granted they're men because of your culture, your biases. You see 35 men. It surprised me. I thought it was brave of a girl to be part of a world that was dominated by men up to now. She had something special even as a little girl. Apart from the fact she's a girl in a man's world. From what I gathered, she was very clear about her future. Women are very underrepresented in motorcycling. She's a woman in a man's world. I'm Ana Carrasco, I'm 22 years old, I'm from a village in Murcia called Cehegín, and I'm a world championship motorcycle rider. My dream has always been to become world champion. I'm one of the lucky few who has actually achieved it. My dad is the main reason why we're talking about this today. My dad always used to take us to do sport together, to go running in the mornings, cycling in the mountains. We bought a motorbike so the three of them could try it out. She took snacks and sandwiches. The kids were getting on and off the bike all the time. We gave them a snack and spent the afternoon that way, sort of like a hobby. It started off as a hobby and... as a way of having fun, like going out on a bicycle. She'd ride a mini motorbike... and that way she'd play and have fun. The three of us would go everywhere with my mum and dad. Yes, we'd get on the motorbike right from when we were little. We all had the same opportunities to ride bikes as my sister Ana. First, my sister María Victoria, then my sister Ana, then me. María Victoria didn't like it, I thought it was fun, but I preferred playing football, so in the end... the motorbike was left sitting there. Time went by. Her sister didn't want to carry on because when she fell over she realised it was dangerous. I started crying and said I didn't want to carry on, I didn't want to ride the bike again because I was afraid. So I got off. Her little sister was over the moon, now the bike was hers. It was our hobby, but Ana was the one who was into it. As parents, we supported her as much as we could when she demanded things. I was given my first bike as a present when I was three and I made my dad put it in my room so I could sleep with it. When I was four I wanted to race, but they wouldn't let me. I cried for three days solid until they agreed. We started taking her so that she would have fun, but actually she was the one who got us involved in the races. She was competing by the time she was four. We're finally joined by the star. Gosh, Ana, you go so fast. Yes. How come you ride so well? Well... I don't know. You accelerate in some spots and brake in others. How come you ride so well? I accelerate quickly and brake late. You're just a kid, aren't you scared to ride such a big bike? No. No? Well I'd be scared. It doesn't scare me. How do you concentrate in a race? What do you do? What do you think about on the bike? I imagine that it's just training and that I'm by myself. What do your parents say? They say I'm the best. Do you want to be a professional motorbike rider when you grow up? Yes. Who do you want to be like? Who's your idol? Dani Pedrosa. Ladies and gentlemen: Dani Pedrosa. Álex Márquez. Ana Carrasco. Yes, I think that the goal is to be here every year. I think that it helps to encourage the presence of women in motorcycling. Seeing that women like Laia Sanz, or me in this case, are obtaining good results in traditionally more male categories. That helps the grassroots to grow. I'm very pleased to be here yet another year, it's a sign that last year was a great season for us. The feeling on the grid when you have your eyes shut... You have to say to yourself, "I'm in charge because I'm here." Today we have one hope of winning the championship. Today is the day. Okay, Mara, we go in with P6. Come on, come on, come on! Come on, damn it. 56-2-1. Hendra has made 56-5 but she's slightly ahead. She was two tenths faster in the first half-time. Oh, Dad! Dad! - I couldn't overtake. - That doesn't matter. You did a great job. You did a great job, believe me. I couldn't overtake him. - He was blocking me. - You did a great job, take it easy. Relax. Take it easy. You got third position. - Enjoy, we'll look at it later. - I'm pissed off. Just enjoy your result. After a bad result like the one we got, she'd burn down everything. She'd burn the box, everything. She's very angry. I'm not crazy. If the bike is fine, I go fast. If it isn't, I don't race. Ana is very demanding. She likes everything to go... as smoothly as possible. - The front one... - Yes. I get a weird feeling... And that makes her demand a lot of others. Even me. She can be demanding with me. Sometimes... I forget things that she is very clear about... and we end up... having our differences. When Ana is angry.... Wow. He was messing about with me. I was telling him to go for it. And he was like this. Out of twelve laps, we can't screw up ten. We just can't. What I mean by "wow" is that I've seen her angry... and I find it cool. It's cool because she's explosive. I lost it on the run-off area... - I saw it from up there. - Bloody hell. If they don't go fast, you catch them up in three turns. They told me when I joined the crew. "Careful with Ana when she's angry, she doesn't mince her words." Ana is really good. I've seen a lot of riders and the time comes that when you see one racing, you realise how good they can be. Go for it, Ana! Go for it! Go for it! She's very communicative. Then you check it out with the data and see that's she's right. She helps quite a bit when tuning-up the bike. It needed to be half a tooth longer on the crank trigger. It's hard for me to stop the bike here. The change we made to the fork has got worse. I think that when Ana is on the bike she feels everything or nothing. I think that’s when she can completely let herself go and feel free. What I liked about riding is that I could be myself. It was what I liked doing, I was by myself and I could do whatever I wanted. There is nothing that lets you feel that free, that independent. Jesus. This girl really races. She gives her all, you see her working every day, doing sport every day, being careful about what she eats. She's super strict. I enjoy riding fast. Feeling that everything is going fine and I can do what I want. I love the feeling of speed on a bike. She says that it feels like she's sprinting all the time. That is what is fun for me, but... it's very different getting on a bike to have fun and getting on it to win. She's competitive in everything. Since she was little. She couldn't lose at a video game, she couldn't lose a football match. She always ended up quarrelling because she always wanted to win. We went on holiday where there was a racing circuit nearby. We spent the morning on the beach, they'd play like all the other kids. And in the afternoons, training at the circuit. There was always a circuit somewhere on all the holidays we ever took. We could go and play with the others. If we went out to play. There were maybe 10 or 20 other families who were doing the same thing. They liked it and had fun. It was a lifestyle that made them happy. It was always motorbikes, motorbikes, motorbikes. She wanted more. But it kept on growing and there comes a time when you can't stop it. You see that she likes it, she enjoys it. I think that it was something that we enjoyed and had fun doing, but I knew from the start that it was what I wanted to do. That's the life she's chosen. It always has been. There's no stopping it. When she began competing in regional championships on those mini motorbikes, the people around us who were also competing said the same. They said she was talented and a good rider. And because we saw that she was having fun... We had a motorhome. When we went to bigger circuits, we set it up there. It was like our second home. We'd spend all our weekends there. Like fairground workers, but going from one circuit to another. Something like that. Always training and rushing off to all the championships. And as she got older, the championship level went up. It was something she was set on from when she was a kid. From the moment she tried it, she wanted more and more. She won three championships in one season. The Open of Extremadura, the Murcia Championship and the Castrol Cup. She won three in the same year. No girl had ever won those or any other championships. Maybe one hundred kids were competing. And perhaps two or three were girls. There was a junior world championship in Valencia. So we decided to go and see it. There were so many kids they competed in two sessions. We were surprised when she finished number 22. There were kids from all over the place. The very best of each country in Europe. And that made us sit up and realise she'd done a great job considering she hadn't been riding long on this particular bike. And somehow, that was where it began. If she was among the world's best and she'd only just begun, she must be good. Motorcycle racing is a very expensive sport. Starting with the fact that every time you go to the circuit you use a set of tyres, you have petrol, travelling expenses. Every training session you do... Every time you leave home it costs a stack of money. However little you spend, it's still a lot. And actually... the family made a big investment and took risks to finance it at the beginning to be able to afford to pay the teams and carry out projects... It's crazy. Ana was so successful in 2013. When she competed in the third race she had no backing that year. The sponsor made the first payment and then withdrew. So my dad asked my brother and me what we thought about selling the motorhome so that my sister could keep competing. The motorhome belonged to the whole family, it was where we'd shared moments with the kids. It was when the sponsor let us down and the team had no money. We both agreed. We preferred her to carry on competing in the races if it meant selling it. It cost us €150,000. We rolled up, had lunch and said: "Let's see how much you can get for it." That's how it was. He sold the motorhome and my sister carried on racing. End of story. We never got wind of anything at home. Things were always fine. I don't ever remember having problems when I was a teenager. Never. All the bad stuff is coming out now that it's over. My mum took care of us while my dad accompanied my sister. And if we had money problems, we never heard about it. And that's thanks to my mum. My dad was always a lot more involved in everything. He taught me virtually everything that I know. He always came training with me. We spent the whole day together. Travelling, training... Night and day. We shared the same hotel room. We shared a lot of experiences from when I was three up to about 17. I cracked one of my teeth while eating. Now what? We needed all our money for a good pre-season to compete in the world championship. So, the dentist would cost us €100. If we ate out, it would be the same. No, we needed it for training. In the end, I pulled out my own tooth. I pulled out half of it with a pair of pliers. The problem comes when eventually we stop being the parents who go with her and it becomes more professional. It happened sometime between when I was 13-14. Up until then I'd always been a good rider, I'd won championships and races and did a good job, but I went to the races with my dad. I didn't have a team or anything. It was a process of change. It wasn't easy either going from it being a hobby to a professional activity. She joined a team. That's where her problems started. Because she was the first girl who'd done it. So that meant a lot of problems. What I mean is that the riders didn't want to pass the finish line with her next to them, or they didn't want her to be ahead of them on the next lap. They sort of isolated her. My sister was the only female in the world championship. I remember she had a really tough time. It was really hard for her at that time. There were no female riders. The world championship wasn't ready to accept female riders. It was weird for everyone. The riders, the teams, the press... It was something new that had never happened before and everyone needs time to adapt to it. I've heard such terrible things about the circuit. "If you can't win, I'll have you mopping floors." "If you can't beat a girl, I'll have you mopping floors." How can a father or a mother allow something so disrespectful? You always have someone who doesn't mind and lends you a hand, otherwise you have to give up. In this case it was Luis Salom who lent her a hand and helped her, he didn't care. He was the only one. That's why she's so fond of him. That was where she found the support she needed. - Support that nobody gave her. - Because she's a woman. They built up a friendship because of those circumstances. He gave her the support that she needed at the time. And of course she's very fond of him. Young guys in their late teens and early twenties don't like to be beaten. They're competitive and want to race. But what they like even less is to be beaten by a woman. Ana Carrasco! What happens is that once they're in the box, the adult is the one who encourages them by saying: "How can a girl be in front of you?" It's like you're less of a man. It's so absurd to try and show your manliness that way. It's absurd. What kind of manliness is that? Saying you want to be better than a woman because she was born one way and you were born another. That makes no sense. We've been trying to gain equality for years but it's impossible. Something as simple as that. It's very simple from my point of view. I have three kids and they're equal. I have two daughters and a son. I think that I do contribute indirectly. My goal is 100% sport, my goal is personal, but I do know that in some way I am contributing to this, helping other women to gain more opportunities, making it easier for them get to where I am. And really... I like that. At the end of the day, being able to do my bit and helping to make everyone equal is important to me. But I think that what is especially important is to believe we are equal. That's equality, isn't it? Not stopping to think about it. That's the way I see it and what I believe. I've never stopped to think about it. I believe it's a question of attitude and rising above it. In my everyday life, I never stop to think that I'm a woman. I'm really proud of the way I am, of the things I've experienced that have made me who I am. I'm grateful to my family and the people who taught me to be a good person, which I think I am. I never stop to think that I'm a woman. I don't care. I'm me, I'm Ana. This is the way I am, end of story. - From the beginning. - It was good job. Yes, amazing! It was amazing! Go and rest. - I will let her rest before the race. - Yes. Congratulations yesterday on the pole. I understand the kids. It must be very tough. You're at school and they ask you, "Did the race go well?" And you say, "No, Ana Carrasco beat me." "Shit, beaten by a girl?" Go for it, Ana! Go, go! I bet the riders' mates pick on them for being beaten by a girl. They may say it as a joke, but you hear the typical remarks. How could a girl have beaten me? She beat you because she's better. It's not about being a guy or a girl. You're brilliant, Ana. It should be regarded as something normal. To start with, we're all people. Ana represents post-feminism. She never talks about being a woman. - She's normalised a situation. - She's normalised it. She never refers to herself as a woman - she's a rider. I think that the biggest change has been going from being "girl on the grid" to a rider on the grid. A rider who wins races, championships, a rider to watch out for. Today one pilot who stands out from the rest on the grid. Looks like Ana Carrasco didn't want a paddock girl to hold her umbrella. The rider found a clever, tongue-in-cheek way of questioning the role of these girls. Up to now it was standard practice at the start of a race, but we don't know for how much longer. I fractured my elbow when I was nine, that was my first operation. Then my collar bone, my shoulder... I had minor injuries almost on a daily basis. My shoulder injury was quite tough because it happened at a time in my sporting career that was complicated. And it was what made me pull out of the Moto3 World Championship. It's like you're watching something that isn't real. You're at home, you turn on the TV, and you're watching her. And then you see how she falls off. What happened? They cut the image. Is she hurt? And when they start saying that she's fractured her shoulder... I just felt completely numb. Her shoulder was so inflamed they couldn't operate. It was horrible. Then they operated and after that she did rehabilitation at home. It was a tough summer for her and for everyone. The shoulder injury, the fact the sponsors left her in the lurch the year before... I looked at her and asked myself why we needed to go through all this. This wasn't right for a girl her age. At her age she should be out having fun with her friends, not suffering in a hospital. It was a bad injury, the doctor told me to forget the championship, forget finishing. He said I'd need two years to recover. And so obviously that... It was like saying I'd never compete in a world championship ever again. It was a tough blow for her and for everyone. You see she wants to pull something off and in the end she can't do it because there are so many problems. You don't know if she'll eventually be able to do it or not. It was an awful year. She cried a lot, lost her temper. But then you saw what strength of character she had when she got up, left the hospital, and began doing exercise. They told her she'd be laid up for six months, but in just two months she was onboard a bike again. In Ana's category, which could be called world-class category, there are more risks. Although they don't race as fast, there is more physical contact. In general, all the races in this category have been... equally tough. The riders are very young and they want to show their talent. Sometimes they overdo it when they take risks. To be honest, I never think of the risks I take when I get on the bike. I've come to terms with the fact and I do understand that we risk our lives in this sport. But I never think this could be the last time I'll do it. Can it happen? Yes. But we never stop to think about it. Unfortunately, I experienced it up close. Luis Salom's death. I was very close to him. So... all of that affected me personally. It's especially hard for the family. You see that something exactly the same happened to someone close. He was a Moto2 World Championship who died three... Yes, three years ago in 2016. Here in Montmeló. So... thinking that there's danger doesn't help you to go fast or win. All ready to go here in Portimao for the 7th race of this 2017 season. García has number 41. Ana Carrasco, third, with number 2. A great get away from García, who is out first. Ana Carrasco overtaking on her Kawasaki Ninja 300, recognizable because of those yellow rims. Three riders in front: Marc García, Dani Valle and Ana Carrasco. Still in the fight, Ana goes into second position, now in third position. Constant overtaking here. Three laps left, it's still a close battle between García, Valle and Carrasco, all fighting for victory. Last lap now and Carrasco is out in front, but with a few turns left, García and Coppola take the initiative again. We'll see if Ana has something up her sleeve. Yes, she makes the most of the Yamaha's slipstream to go past the chequered flag in first position. This has been a truly epic end. Ana Carrasco has reaped the reward. She has become the first woman to win a world motorcycling race championship. Sixty years of racing events have had to go by for us to witness this historic moment. The first woman to win in a world racing championship. A day to remember, one that has already made motorcycling history. When she won, it was like she was getting back on track. I was with her sister when it was over. - They were somewhere else. - We couldn't believe it. They all went running off to the podium. I didn't hug anyone or do anything. I was sort of sleepwalking. I felt like... I felt like I'd died and woken up in heaven. Amazing. The feeling a father has when he sees what his child achieved after all that effort. Carrasco! It was the joy of seeing that she'd reached her goal. But without thinking that she was going to be the first woman or its importance at international level. What was going through my mind was the personal satisfaction she would be feeling at that moment. - Her face said it all. - That was her goal. Ana Carrasco! If you can go fast once without any hitches, technically you can do it twice. Then three, four, five, six times. It's worth investing in that person as an individual, and because you know you can work with them and create a project. The project was set up. The limitations weren't so much about Ana, but rather the technical and human structure behind it to ensure that she won. I thought that we would never find a team who believed in a woman as a world champion. It was what I had wanted to have all my life. When we go to the races we never talk to her about the motorbikes. Otherwise, we interfere with her work, her performance. We act like her parents: we give her kisses and hugs. And that's all. She knows that we're there for her and that's it. The team does believe a woman can win. They certainly do. They're committed to her. And their rider is Ana Carrasco. Mario is in charge of telemetry and he's chief technician. - Feels stiff, what do you say? - Maybe. His job is to interpret what I say. - I think it still feels hard. - Do you? - Back and front. - But wasn't there a change? Yes, the bike is running better, much smoother. I feel things on the track, on the bike, and he's the one who decides how to improve it. More grid is needed. - But since the track is sort of... - No, don't be too sure. When I accelerate a lot, it's like... It's strange, the bike is a living thing. It always tells you something. Every coloured line means something. Based on those values, you analyse it and act. I'm the chief mechanic. Fleky is fantastic. There's no other word for it. I'm teaching Mara how it works and how it operates, because Mara has a motocross background. Fleky has been a blessing to me. He suggests how to handle the bike, what needs doing. He's in charge of the technical aspects. Good, go for it, go for it! Jesus! Mara is wonderful. Mara is a lovely person, she's fun, a hard worker. She's a professional. She's an ace, the smart one. Perfect. I think that Jordi is the one she relies on most. We need to keep up the pressure. Especially the feeling that the race is on already. Get a feel for everything. We haven't ridden for six hours. You're in the middle, huh? Taking no risks. I need someone to bring me down to Earth. He's the most cool-headed person, able to stay calm in the most stressful moments. In the end, he's the one who helps calm down the team. He makes sure everyone does their job, even if the situation is a bit stressful or critical. He calms me down. I know that whatever happens, I always go out feeling relaxed, knowing what I've got to do. You get away first, two will be behind you. If you get away last, six will be behind you. They'll be behind you, so you get away first. Whoever follows you. They have a great relationship. Ana relies on him a lot. He makes her feel relaxed, and that's good for her. He gives her confidence. You find the slipstream or look for it, that's how it is. - I'll go all out. - Go like crazy. - Then we'll see how... - But give it your all, huh? He really helps to bring out the best in me. Jordi acts like a father with Ana. Yes. She's the apple of his eye. In fact, one time Ana's father said to him: "Look after her as if she were your own daughter." Mario, the front or back pressure haven't gone down, huh? They've stayed the same or increased. They were at 2.44. Mara? Give Mario the tyre pressure figures. - In front or at the back? - Stay in front. - Let them follow you if they can. - Okay. But calmly, do what you know how to do. Ricky joining the team as the coach was also a great help. Because after all, he's a former rider, he knows how to deal with lots of things at all stages. That was his contribution. There's no pothole here. To avoid thinking about them, make sure the bike doesn't move. Don't wait for potholes or your mind will never react. You brake here, get stuck, and you're done. You didn't hit it, but you go slow. I'm waiting for it to do this, then I accelerate. There's a spot... Keep the bike straight and move like we said. But don't lower your upper body, just your whole hip. Ricky will tell you now, then you picture it, okay? Let him say what he has to and you picture it. On such a long turn, it's important to get your knee down quickly. Like we said. Put it down before, you spin like a compass needle. Ana had never touched the ground. She'd never done motocross or flat track or anything. We started from scratch. Working body-to-body, which is what she found hard. She wanted to win by racing fast, racing away from everyone, but that isn't it. That might happen once, but normally you fight for your space. Hold on, hold on! Tighter, tighter! Come on, go for it! Move it, move it, move it! Come on, go for it, Ana! Go for it! That's the way! That's it! For me this team is so important in my career and in my life. If people are to perform to the max, they need to feel comfortable. Part of the job is to create that environment or try and create the right working environment. Either you get on with your team or it just won't work. They're more like my family than my bosses. Even though I always joke about it, I actually have seven fathers and seven mothers. We're following Fleky, this is tricky. - He's walking in the shade. - That's what I mean. We might end up in Murcia, it's all connected. Anyone want a lucky charm bracelet? We'll need it. It's for good luck. - Shall we bless it? - They are already. We bought them here and next year we'll win the world championship. You can have the best bike, but if the rider isn't any good you won't get to where you need to be. And you can have the best rider, but if the bike isn't well tuned-up you won't get there, either. They need each other. Even though the pianist is brilliant... If the piano is out of tune, there's no music. This is the most finely-tuned piano in its category. Bloody hell, get in here! - Did you call your dad? - I can't, I need Wi-Fi. When I get in, it's noisy. And this one? You go on the inside? You touch the new wall? A straight line. See the guy in the Kawasaki shirt? The girl on the left? Straight there, stop, and go right. This is just for Superbikes there are too many meters to try... And this long, so... You stop and then start to build the speed. In our sport, Jonathan is... the best Superbikes rider in history. And I'm lucky enough to experience all of this by his side. He comes to see her after each training session, asks questions, shows interest. On Thursdays we all go together on the circuit lap. Johnny gives Ana an awful lot of help. Both on and off the track walk. On a daily basis. She's very professional. But when she's riding she looks like she's having fun. Off the bike she's having fun. We have a saying in English: "When you smile, the world smiles with you." And sometimes behind her helmet I can see her smiling, even in the most difficult of situations. You can tell that she loves to ride the bike and that's really nice. I don't know how this relationship came about, but it's amazing. They really love each other. I can see that it's mutual admiration. It's magical. They experience victories and defeats as if they were their own. Johnny drops everything to watch one of Ana's races. He leaves the Japanese waiting, data engineers... "Hang on, I'll be right back." He goes off, watches the race like a maniac, like a hooligan, yelling like it's the end of the world. If she wins, he goes off. If she loses, he gets so depressed. He's like a fan. Just another hooligan. It's amazing. Come on! He sees Ana differently. He likes Ana to win. I can tell her stuff from outside the track. But if it's cold, or the track is slippery because there is no rubber or whatever, he tells her, I can't. When he sees something strange or potentially dangerous, he runs to the box and says, "Ana, I recommend you do this." Depending on what Rea says, we adapt it to our category with our power and our tyres. Seeing how he does things helps me to want to be better and improve myself every day. If I have to focus on someone or on how I'd like to be, I'd like to be like him. I think tomorrow will be with the sun. We start at three. She has number two. It's there on the left. Look confident and don't stop. Like you know where you're going. - Don't even brake. - The trick is not to look at them. You have to look convincing when you do illegal stuff. Don't look at the guy, drive straight through. Like you've been here a thousand times. This is your home. Then they'll throw me in jail when this documentary comes out. For being dodgy. Come on, your turn to work. Conviction. It's over here on the right. Drive straight ahead. Don't look at him. Quick, quick, quick! - Don't look, huh? - Don't look. Did we get through? You did something illegal for the first time. At the circuit. Yes, here at this circuit. How do you concentrate in a race? What do you do? What do you think about on the bike? I imagine that it's just training and that I'm by myself. - What do your parents say? - That I'm the best. Come on, come on! You were going to be the worst, huh? Hello and welcome to the 2018 Superbike World Championship. We're at Donington Park in the United Kingdom. In the previous race held in Imola, Ana Carrasco completely owned it and she's currently the Supersport 300 world champion. Today she's back again from pole position. Will the 21-year-old from Murcia clinch it again? First position on the grid for Carrasco, Meuffels and Pérez. The championship is led by Ana Carrasco on her Kawasaki Ninja, a much more solid partnership than last year. This year's bike has greater cylinder capacity and acceleration, but that isn't what makes the difference, there are a lot of bikes like hers on the starting grid. The difference is that yesterday, Saturday, Ana Carrasco, smashed Meuffels' score by 48 ms and blasted to new pole position. We think it might be hard for Ana to win again with such absolute authority like she did in Imola. The key for her will be to lead the race right from the start. But check out her rivals: Meuffels, Pérez, Loureiro, Sánchez, Deroue, among others. Supersport 300 is a category where nothing can be taken for granted. The competition between these young riders is fierce, willing to make a name for themselves in the world of motorcycling. Will Carrasco be able to take the pressure and keep the lead? It's impossible to predict what will happen now. The light goes off and this year's fourth World Supersport 300 race starts here in Donington Park. A stunning start by the leader, benefitting from her position to get a few metres away from her rivals. That was a superb start by Ana. Koen Meuffels, Mika Pérez and Borja Sánchez well placed after the first turn, but not quite enough because Carrasco is already leading the race. Ana is imposing her intense rhythm, leaving Meuffels and the others behind. Ana is developing quite a gap. Carrasco is showing what she already revealed in practice: no one has more rhythm than she does. Despite her youth, remember that this rider already holds several motorcycling titles in Spain: First Spanish woman to score points in the World Championship in Malaysia. She was also the first Spanish woman to win a world speed race, that was in Portimao last year. Or to do what she's doing now: being the undisputed leader of the Supersport 300 World Championship. Carrasco tears up yet another lap, she has a 4.5 second advantage over her rivals. It's quite unusual to see that much distance in this category between first and second classified riders. No battle to lead here, the world champion is setting a rhythm the others can't keep up with. Carrasco has finished a fantastic race once again. From start to finish, just like in Imola. Setting her rhythm, with absolutely no need for the slipstream. Just her and her Kawasaki. Together, they've secured an undisputable victory. Ana Carrasco takes the first position of the championship with 73 points, 22 more than Grünwald and 27 more than Scott Deroue, the third classified rider. The next date is the Czech Republic from 8-10 June. Will Carrasco be able to hold on to this significant advantage? Your second successive victory. What a race here at Donington. It's incredible for us. I think we did a really good job. It's really good for us and the championship. I want to say thanks to all my team, to Kawasaki and all the people who are around me. Also, to my family and friends who are watching me at home. As a mother, I experience all the difficulties she faces, and I've seen her achieve something almost impossible. You enjoy it in a way... It's indescribable, you don't know how to explain what you feel. Not so much for yourself, but for how she's been rewarded. But I also feel a great satisfaction as a woman. To be able to say, "Bravo for my daughter." She's able to fight for her goal. Despite all the difficulties and hardships that she's had, she knew how to stick with it and was able to achieve that goal. And to show the world that a woman can do it. I feel like I've been given two prizes, so to speak. I feel incredibly satisfied both as a mother and as a woman. After winning those two races, the regulations changed. From then on, the change made things worse for me. We had to add a lot of ballast to the bike and I suffered as a result. There was a rule change about "weight-rider." Motorbike plus rider. If the weight wasn't right, they added kilos. 12 kg extra on a bike is a dead weight that alters your centre of gravity, it pushes you outside on turns, you can't brake. 12 kg of muscle for turning a bike is not the same as a dead weight that messes with you on every turn. Things began to get really tough. We went from winning outright, as it were, to struggling to stay among the first ten. I took it very badly. I saw how I was gradually losing the series of points that I'd won. They were catching me up and there were less and less races. So it was really agonising. We were losing when victory had been ours all year. In some of the races it was hard for us to brake or to turn. We were already championship leaders, but managing that was not easy until the end of the year. Obviously, it's very hard to win a championship, but I think that staying on top is even tougher. The kind of pressure that Ana was under from half way through the year to the end, is not easy to handle. You're about to make history. Here comes the group, Scott Deroue is clearly in the lead. It looks like the Supersport 300 World Championship won't be decided here in Portimao, but in fact this category looks more open than ever. The Dutch rider making the most of his options to clinch the title. Winning would mean being 5 points ahead of Carrasco, who had a terrible start and has gone down to 17th position. We can see her trying to regain positions here. Deroue, on the other hand, is having a superb race. He wants to keep on pressuring the Spaniard in this championship. Ana has lost points in the last races that might be vital for winning the championship or not. A fantastic win by Deroue in his first victory of the year. Way ahead of Carrasco, who eventually comes in 11th. Despite everything, she's still in the lead, ahead of Deroue, Pérez and Grünwald. She'll reach the last event with 90 points, ten points more than Deroue, who is second after this victory, and 18 more than Mika Pérez, who is third. Magny-Cours from 29 of September to 1 October, where we find out who is the new world champion. - Anita... - What's up? I'm here already, okay? Yes, we'll be there in about five minutes. - All right, I'll get changed. - See you inside the gym? - Yes, okay. See you later. - Fine. See you later. We're here. I'll send a selfie of us all to the group. So they see we're working. Write "Me and my shadows." I'll do it now and see what they say. Physical training is always the hardest part of the season. We put in hours of bike, gym and strength training. The pre-season and summer are especially tough, with five or six hours of intense daily training. I think that physically, riders have to be completely prepared. Having quick reflexes and the ability to make decisions at 200 kmph in just one second, requires you to have a level of physical fitness that enables you to think calmly. Being physically fit for a race is basic if you want to be competitive during a weekend event. Come on, Ana, squeeze tight when you finish. Fifteen. We go to France, the last race, with a ten-point advantage compared to the second one. Damn, she could be the world champ. It's a possibility, right? It was a very stressful weekend. I didn't want to see anyone. Believe in yourself. First, she had to go up a few positions to opt for the title. I think that the title was being disputed by four people. It was pretty complicated. There were 25 of us on the grid. My rival, Deroue, classified in second position, was on pole. The idea was that if he won the race, I'd have to get third place starting in 25th position. That's tough. Here is Ana Carrasco, 25th position on the grid. Lots of work for her to do. It's under way! It turns out that I won back positions in the race. With four or five laps left, Deroue's shift broke. His shift lever broke. A technical issue for the Kawasaki rider! Okay, that's one down. Pérez was in second position, but if he got first, he'd beat Ana by one point. As I was gaining position and he was at the top, first position was changing all the time. They took the last turn... and Pérez finished in second. Dani Valle takes his first race win! Mika Pérez finishes in second position. Is it enough for the title, though? No, it's not! Carrasco takes the World Supersport 300 title by one singular point! I won by one point in the championship. Yes! I didn't know when I passed the finish line. All the photographers were there, the TV crews... Of course I didn't know if I had to stop or not. And when I was approaching, I saw a photographer I've known for ages and I asked him: "Did I win or not?" And he said, "Yes, yes, stop." That was where I found out. My wife ran like a mad thing... I couldn't run. I walked, and as I walked, I had the feeling that each step I took was a really long one, like it was five metres. I felt like a completely different person inside. Ana Carrasco! Some say the most important day in life is when your child is born. For me, this is much more important than when they were born. When they're born, you're excited about having kids, but in the end you're the selfish one. It isn't about them, you're excited about buying them stuff. But having a child is a selfish decision that a couple make between them. So when your kid becomes world champion after struggling by herself, facing all the difficulties that she has, crying her eyes out like she has, possibly not being able race again... There's no price for that. All the money in the world can't buy you that. It's the ultimate reward for me. I don't need her to win any more races or anything. Ana Carrasco, the new Supersport World Champion. This female rider, just 21-years-old, was named world champion yesterday after beating 38 men. Ana Carrasco goes down in motorcycling history. Congratulations, Ana, well done. You're changing history. Carrasco is paving the way, changing the face of motorcycling history. This young lady is teaching a lesson to the motorcycling world. This had never happened before. A woman at the top of the podium. Carrasco's feat changes everything. Motorcycling was a man's world until Ana Carrasco arrived. She's Spanish, from Cehegín in Murcia, and she's now part of world motorcycling history. They're all men at the start line, except for her. Ana has shown there is no difference between men and women when racing. For me, Ana's championship win was like a barrier that was removed. The first woman to win a world championship, that's historic. She's the first woman to win an FIM Championship. A world championship. She's a female world champion, but competing against men. Up to now, no one had achieved what she did. Well, Ana has made history. There's no denying that. I think that record won't be broken. She's one in a million with what she's achieved. Ana Carrasco! Ana has been the first woman in history to win a world championship. And that's a record. She did something that... will be more acknowledged and appreciated as times goes by. She makes history every day, because in the end she's still at the top. She never did it to prove anything. She did it because she loved the event, she worked hard for it and wanted to achieve a goal. And thanks to that goal, things have definitely changed. She's a woman who changed something in the world. That record will go down in history. Fifty years will go by and it'll still be there. That's why these moments are unique, they're written in the history books. Her legacy is in the history books. The work done by Ana and other women will create a balance. I think it's thanks to what they're doing. If a little girl sees a motorbike and she likes it, now she can follow the footsteps of someone else. That's tough if you don't have a role model. Ana Carrasco! It's a message to a lot of women that it's okay to come here. For sure. Especially because it means many people have stopped seeing the difference between "a girl or a rider." Just because she's a female and has a vagina doesn't mean that she can't do whatever. - I've got flow, huh? - Yeah. Told you so. She's broken down barriers. Certainly what she's doing for motorcycling has made motorcycling inclusive of females. This year three or four females are competing in the SSP300 World Championship. That's awesome. I put it down to Ana showing it can be done. But what she's done is shown that you don't have to compete, but you can be a world champ, and she can be really proud of it. Ana has triumphed and more women are competing. There was a before and an after. If we look at the dates, you can see that after Ana's victory and all the media coverage, there are more female athletes appearing on TV in football, basketball... So she helped, but this has to continue. She broke all the barriers that needed breaking down. I think that what Ana did really helped equality. It showed that equality does exist, it's real. There is no difference between men and women. I think this has been a real step forward and a clear vindication. - How are you? - My name is Nina. Like the singer. I wish you all the best. Now that she achieved this, what we need to do is be able to keep it up. Keep it alive. Yes, the "Ride like a Girl" thing. It's usually used in a derogatory way. You're a woman, you can't ride. In a way, she got rid of that slogan that used to exist. It was sort of the right time to say: "That's stupid." I ride like a girl and beat all the men in a world championship. In the end, the world champ rode like a girl! She's done her bit. This is the beginning of a future of equality that promises to be awesome. A little girl from Murcia who raced motorbikes and wanted to be world champion, a small-town kid, without means and in a man's world... Everyone would have said, "No way, she's mad." I did it. So if I did it, everyone can achieve whatever they want. It's about work, believing in it, perseverance and not throwing in the towel when things go wrong. If I'd done that every time things went wrong for me, I'd never have become world champion.
