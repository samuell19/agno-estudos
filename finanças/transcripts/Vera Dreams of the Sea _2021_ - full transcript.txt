Vera. Wake up. - Did you prepare everything? - Almost. What did you do for lunch? Not that much... Mezze, rump steak, two pies... What is it? I forgot to order the baklava. You forgot the baklava... It looks like you left the oven on. I wish it was that. Trust me. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1... Good Morning. Besim Pllana, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Infrastructure, was arrested this morning, along with 6 other Ministry officials. They were arrested after months of investigation for corruption, influence peddling and abuse of power. The materials are certified, all German. It has light, uninterrupted water supply... Oh yes, security cameras in the surroundings. How many square meters? This space, 74m². What? He is looking for 60m². Vera, I know it's not what he wants, but... - How much for the square meter? - In this region, 850 euros. What is he talking about? His nephew said it would be 500 euros. Tell him to buy it with his nephew, since he's so smart! Forget this shit... Vera, Vera! - We have a buyer. - For what? To that house of yours in the middle of nowhere. - Serious? - Yeah. Don't spread the news yet, because it's not official, but they are going to build a highway through the village. You've hit the jackpot, Vera! VERA DREAMS OF THE SEA This side is too dark. Vera, I'm sorry, but we make mistakes too. I wouldn't care but I'm arranging dinner - for Fatmir's birthday. - Ah cool! Since you spend the day in your pajamas, at least be stylish. Did you like it? Maybe I'll wear it today, for dinner. Funny guy! What is this? Open it. Can't you understand? It's the new highway. Now we can sell the house. I saw some apartments for sale in Mat. We can buy one for Sara. And we could change the windows here at home, paint the walls, change the floor... And with what's left, I see both of us having a drink by the sea. Or at least eating a cold watermelon! A little more. That. - You're a bit short. - Vera, how much do you need? Don't worry. I'll bring it later, right? - We are neighbors. - Thanks. My God, they don't get tired of war! I forgot to bring enough money for the groceries. Fatmir... Fatmir! Fatmir. Fatmir... Fatmir. Fatmir... Fatmir... Fatmir... Fatmir. Fatmir! Where were you? In the market. Was he alone? Just about 10 minutes. The door was locked. I unlocked it when I got back. Nobody could have entered. Do you have any anxiolytics? Hey. How are you? Is there any of your guys on duty? There was a suicide. I don't want the press. Fatmir Gashi. Dardania street, 14 - door 4. I owe you this one. The police will take care of everything. The police? My people. Don't worry. - What are you looking for? - Maybe he left a suicide note. I shouldn't have left him alone. Vera... Nobody must know what happened. Hello. I saw Fatmir for the first time in the corridors of Law School. Tall, handsome, well dressed, wearing a tie. I said, "Good morning, teacher!" And he, to save me from embarrassment, replied: "Good morning." He was like this with everyone: Fair, honorable, kind. The death of Judge Fatmir Gashi is not just a loss for his family and colleagues, but for the whole of Kosovo, that is still rebuilding itself. Fatmir, my dear friend, rest in peace. My condolences. My condolences. He was a great man. Take some. Whenever he visited, he would bring Egzon a gift. A chocolate, a toy... He often gave money too. He loved Egzon like a son. Hana. Basri... He always said: "Ahmet, you are like a brother to me." Sorry. Take more. Fatime, get more. This man has been through a tragedy! All of his brothers died in the war. And he stood up again. What happened? Ahmet... - It's already getting dark. - I know. And the last bus is just coming by. I'll take you home. Why do you never say anything? One, he is our guest. And two, he is your father's closest cousin. It even seems that Dad lived just for him and Egzon. Lower your voice. They can hear everything. Vera, do I take the tray out of the oven? Yes. You didn't have to. Just because he died doesn't mean we shouldn't celebrate his birthday. After a brief illness, at age 65, the renowned judge Fatmir Gashi died. Gashi has been a judge since the late 1960s. His career was interrupted in the 90s, when he was forced to abandon his job by the violent measures of the Belgrade government. Why did you come to work? You can take a few days off. - Vera. - Ahmet. - How are you? - Well. Do you have a visitor? I don't. You may come in. Take it. Thanks. Vera... Fatmir and I had some unfinished businesses. What businesses? His house in the village. - What about it? - He gave it to me. What do you mean, gave it to you? Didn't he tell you? No. The last time he went to the village, he said: "Ahmet, my brother, you always took such good care of this house. I want to give it to you, for your only son." I'm sorry I have to tell you this. I thought you knew. All that's missing is Fatmir's signature. Yours now, of course. - What is this? - The lawyer's letter. And what do I do with it? Sign it. Did Fatmir leave written proof about this? I just explained. This letter proves nothing. - You don't believe me? - I want proof. Do you think I'm trying to steal his house? Our house. Vera, you know Fatmir was like a brother to me. Enough of this brother talk. Please sign. I beg you, sister. Let's close this matter. It started 3 or 4 days ago. On the first day, I felt it in my fingertips. In the second day, it started to spread. It went to my hands, to my palms, until it started to run down my spine. Since yesterday, is standing right in the middle of my spine, and I can't move. Can you be more specific? I don't know how to explain. It feels like nails going through my fingertips. You smell like beans. I love beans! Behind nine meadows, nine mountains, nine rivers, nine brothers. Oh dear father, why did you leave me so far away? Again. Behind nine meadows, nine rivers, nine mountains, nine brothers... Behind nine meadows, nine rivers, nine mountains, nine brothers... Behind nine meadows, nine rivers, nine mountains, nine brothers... Behind nine meadows, nine rivers, nine mountains, nine brothers... Behind nine meadows, nine rivers, nine mountains, nine brothers... Behind nine meadows, nine rivers, nine mountains, nine brothers... Behind nine meadows, nine rivers, nine mountains, nine brothers... Behind nine meadows, nine rivers... - Can't we change anything? - Get out! What is it? - I can't do it. - It's quite simple. - Can't we change anything? - No. I don't want to change the meaning. Just the structure of the phrase, I don't know. Say it. Say it. Say it. No. Honey, listen. If you can't say a line, it will be difficult to continue the play. I'm serious. Mom! Take 10 minutes. Why are you crying? Mom is tired. She's been working a lot. I'm just a bit sad. You know, I had an idea. How about you do your nails with Shema? - OK. - Go, love. - Bye, honey. - Goodbye! Do you want me to take her home? You can get her after the rehearsal. Don't interfere if you have no idea what's going on. Her backpack. -Avni? -Vera, how are you? - Sorry to bother you. - I couldn't answer that time. The buyer is pressuring me. - He increased the offer. - I don't know what to say. I'm in trouble. With or without problems, it increased from 30 thousand to 80 thousand. How much? 80 thousand, Vera. No one will offer that. I'll come over there so we can talk. - Prepare the documents and decide. - See you later. Hey, Vera! Why did you pass by me as if I'm a ghost? Hello. Why don't you answer? Are you avoiding the collectors? Vera is here. Alone, as a boss. Ask about the key. Listen... Where is the key to Fatmir's house? It's with him. OK. Right. Ok! This call is not free. See you soon. Come on! - Did my wife put you to work? - Just a little bit. - Get that dog away from me! - Well, he doesn't bite. Come on, Egzon! Come! What happened here? The pipes froze and exploded. It flooded the whole house. You should have seen my hands. They bled from rubbing so much. Go see the red peppers in the oven. You're right. And the furniture? They're in the warehouse. Elmaze wrapped everything up. It must be all right. Did Fatmir know? Without his approval, we wouldn't even open the windows. He didn't say anything. He didn't want to worry you. What do you need the dog for, Ahmet? You can't trust anyone these days. I hope you don't blame me. I don't. You are right. Fatmir hasn't been doing well lately. What did he have? His heart. Hey Ahmet! Hey! Are you home, man? I am! Welcome! - It's all right? - All great, thank you. Uncle Avdyl, how are you? How are you? Come. - It's all right? - Yes and you? - Did you come walking? - Yes, I took my time. Take it easy. We were here, the same men who are here today. Fatmir was right there when he said to Ahmet: "Ahmet, such and such and such and such... The house is yours!" - Wasn't it, boys? - It was just like that. Ahmet is no liar. He is an honorable man. He took care of Fatmir's house the best he could. And, as you can see, he doesn't have many possessions. We're telling how it happened. But even if it hadn't happened, to be honest, the house would be Ahmet's anyway. Fatmir had no son to inherit it. Then Egzon, son of Ahmet, is the legitimate heir. Maybe the lady from the big city doesn't know how it works, but here in the village and in the whole region, a female daughter never inherited a house. I see they are building new houses in the village, and the highway is coming. Yes, those who live abroad are building for their children but we take care of our own business. We want peace with everyone. We don't want problems, either with our own or with foreigners. Uncle Avdyl, see... Her signature is all we need. You must be educated. You can read. You certainly know how to use a pen. You're not a child. The house was flooded. Maybe it needs... Madam! We're not just talking about the house. We are talking about the final words of a good and honest man. Ahmet. Excuse me. I have to go. Stay. You haven't finished your tea. God bless you all. Don't worry. This way. Ahmet, he's really mad! Can we go? Come on, men! - Have a good day. - Thanks. Calm down. They cut our power. I didn't pay the bill. Do you need money? I lost the lead role. He said, "It's not for you." He offered me a minor role. Two scenes, no lines. Because of that phrase? What an idiot! It's not his fault. I will not accept it. And what are you going to do? We choose the profession to be respected. In matters of the heart, We always find a way to listen to it. That's what daddy said. He wasn't sick. He killed himself. He didn't left any written proof. Doesn't it help? You don't have anything. He has witnesses. Yes, some men he brought to say that. What do you mean? Are they lying? Fatmir would never make such a decision without consulting me. Fatmir wasn't doing well. Furthermore, the war destroyed the village. The house is worthless. The value rose from 30 thousand to 80 thousand. Was it for sale? I have a buyer. For real? This house, Basri, is the future of my daughter and granddaughter. Good Morning. The construction of the Pristina-Skopje highway was interrupted for reasons of expropriation. Civil society once again appealed to the authorities, asking them to guarantee the transparency of the process and recalling the corruption scandals of the previous project. - Ahmet. - Vera. - What are you doing here? - Taking care of some business. Do you have businesses here on the channel? No. TV is not my business. What happened? I was trying to train that dog, but he's too stubborn, it's no use. - Was he the one who hurt you? - I fell. I came to ask for your signature again. You haven't said anything else since that day. Nobody asked me anything. What did you expect? That someone there would hear you? Uncle Avdyl and the others... That's the way they are. They are simple men. What can I say? I will not sign. Why? The house is mine. Yes, but it was Fatmir's will. Fatmir left no will. What are you talking about? You heard what Uncle Avdyl said. He gave 3 children for this country! He built 3 schools in the city! Three! Think some more. I'll be back. Hello. Hello! Naz, bet it all for me. It's a lot of money, Fatmir. How would you pay it back? I've already decided. I am strong as a bull. I'll pay you 20% more. In two minutes. You never made money so easily. - What if you lose? - Impossible. I am a fortress! If you don't sign until Monday noon, this video will be in all media. Fatmir was a gambler. I already knew. But then everyone would know. And Ahmet? Uncle Avdyl and the men? What were they going to do, poor people? They couldn't talk to you about it. But they could lie, right? They will take Egzon from me. They're not kidding. My son's life is worth nothing to them. Who are they? Vera... Please sign. My son's life is in your hands. Mother? Vera, I have to go. I'm sorry about your father. Hey, beautiful. - Bye, Vera. - Goodbye. Why was Elmaze crying? For your father. Where have you been? We went to the rehearsal, then to the park. Didn't you turn down the role? I said I was thinking about turning it down. Excellent. What is happening? What? Hana... The kitchen is getting great. I just hope it doesn't take too long to finish. We've been living like this for 3 months. My husband doesn't have time for family. He lives for others. And speaking of the devil... I'll pay in two minutes. You never made money so easily. What if you lose? Impossible! I am a fortress! You have to sign. Why? Do you want to ruin Fatmir's reputation? Everyone knew he gambled. - Sara and Hana too? - Hana is a child. Such a thing marks us for our whole lives. A black car followed me. Did you see who it was? They can't do anything to me. Vera... Do you want to be messing with loan sharks, bandits? Sign the damn document! Why don't you stay for dinner? No. Sara and Hana are waiting for me. - Send them my regards. - Thanks. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Call me when you get home. Hello. Speak it! - I came to get Hana. - She's been gone a long time. What do you mean? - Her father came to get her. - Which father? Hana! Someone caught her in school! Don't scream. We're rehearsing. A man went there to get her! Hana is with Shema in the dressing room. Let's go again. You can't just take any one and say he's her father. Arben is my friend, my colleague and my partner. - He stole your role! - Because of my problems. If he liked you, he would be more considerate. What got into you? Do you think before you speak? Hana! Get up. Go wash your hands! What example are you setting for your daughter? What example did you give me? What example did you give me? Cooking, cleaning, washing, ironing... And shutting up. "Be quiet, the neighbors will hear." "Keep quiet or you'll get slapped." "Shut up and never forget your place." Educated, but not too much. Just enough. Enough to know when to laugh and when to be silent. When daddy kicked me out of the house, what did you do? You kept quiet. Take the medicine. What a horrible taste. If you want to get well, you have to stay at home for a week. I work with my fingers. I don't get tired. But you cut your finger. It's a tiny cut. Hello. Yes, it's Vera. It was a hard crash. The car threw her 3 meters away, and she fell on the asphalt. I spoke to the doctor. She will spend the night in the hospital for observation. The injuries are not serious. And the driver? He ran away, ma'am. Hello. Hello! Hello... I will find you! You will pay for it! Ahmet! Tie the dog! Ahmet! Vera, sorry for bothering you. I know we've been bothering you a lot lately. - Shall I make some tea? - Yes, do it. I ask you to understand. We... You almost killed my daughter. What is there to understand? What? Sarah? Congratulations. Your son is safe. Vera! Wait! Vera! I swear on Egzon and my mother I don't... - Ahmet! - Get inside! We had nothing to do with it. Vera! - Ahmet! - Get inside! Vera, we are family. Who did it? Vera... Who did it? I can't say. Vera... Vera. Waiter, one more round! I pity those who remember with sadness of your youth I pity those who remember with sadness of your youth I don't expect anything good from you I wish you would talk to me again, my love Let me do it. Be careful, don't hurt your mom. - I missed you so much! - Did you get well? Are you alone? Excellent! Congratulations. Go there with mom. - First you click... - No. It has to be double click. It is yes. You click, a photo appears, and you click on the rest. OK. Let's see how it works with the photo. What is this place? What do you want? One beer. A tea, please. How are you? Well. There's no alcoholic beverage. Why didn't you come to my office? I'll pay you 20% more. In two minutes. You never made money so easily. What if you lose? Impossible! I am a fortress! But this is a game, Fatmir. If you lose, unfortunately I'll have to get my money. You know I respect you. I don't want to have to rip your nails off. Don't worry. I give you the village house. It's worth three times this value. Basri, does he have a house in the village? He does. A house with a backyard, right where the highway will pass. Will you be his guarantor? Yes. I will. Credit granted. Vera, turn it off. Bet without fear! Bet everything! Turn it off! Motherfucker... Are you crazy? Relax. Everyone here is deaf. What now? You tell me. What do you want me to say? Don't you see what happened? What exactly happened, Basri? Nothing. We played. We lost. We lost everything. The house? Fatmir bet the house. I was his guarantor. And he lost. He sunk both of us. Are you happy now? And Ahmet? Ahmet needs money. He's willing to do anything. Anything but running over Sara. Vera... You know how these guys are. Do you think they consulted me before doing it? For the love of God! Did you even imagine what had happened? - He said he had stopped. - Did you believe him? Of course. And why did you call me when he killed himself and not the police? And when you saw that he was in danger, why didn't you go to the police? You knew. You knew, but you didn't want to believe it. You held Sara in your arms when she was born. Even before Fatmir. What could I have done? She's lucky to be alive. What are you going to do now? Vera. I have 10 years of career ahead of me. Things are going well. This would destroy me. Please... Fatime... She thinks I quit 3 years ago. She can't even imagine. If she finds out, she'll dump me. If she leaves me, she will take my kids. Fatime is waiting for you to finish the kitchen. Vera, where are you going? SUMMER, 1995. SARA, VERA, FATMIR - Egzon, help them. - It is not necessary. Where's your dog, Ahmet? I gave it away. That mutt was worthless. Come, come... Slowly, slowly! Come come... Fatmir wanted to leave the house to you, but he lost it in a gamble. He never stopped thinking about your future and Hana's. He loved you, but he had this addiction. I knew it, mother. And I told him. The last time we talked. It is not your duty to protect anyone's honor or reputation. Not his, not anyone else's. It's finally over, mom. Do you remember my father? Vaguely. I was too young. He was the only one who wanted to marry my deaf mother. Because his wife had died, leaving him alone with 3 kids. When my mother died, Dad decided to give the house to the boys. I came to Pristina with the only inheritance my mother left me. Inheritance? Sign language. Luckily, I got a job right away. It's not working. What did you do? You look at me, smiling as if you wanted to talk to me Yes, I will talk to you my love I can't wait for the day Yes, I will talk to you my love I can't wait for the day Three brothers were building a fortress high above Valdanos. But the bridge they built by day collapsed at night. Then, 3 wise men appeared and said: "For the wall not to collapse, it will be necessary to sacrifice the woman who brings breakfast and bury her alive on the bridge wall. Only then will the bridge stand." "Leave my right shoulder uncovered, so I can caress my son. Leave my right breast uncovered so I can feed it. Leave my right eye uncovered, so I can see it grow." Judge Basri Haziri has been suspended after the leak of a video where he is seen with the late judge Fatmir Gashi and other men, who have not yet been identified, gambling in a game of cards and staking lands near the new highway. The police and investigation office still not informed whether investigations into the case have already begun. FOR MY MOTHER, VERA.
