I'm here. ﻿It's my husband's computer. ﻿Something's wrong with it. ﻿- What model is it? - The model? ﻿I haven't seen it. ﻿So, it's the bed with ﻿the kids and the... ﻿family. ﻿EshkoL ﻿Yes! ﻿Exactly. The Eshkol model. ﻿Excuse me! ﻿Who's it from? ﻿I don't know. ﻿Hi. ﻿I'm Vicky. ﻿Lady Gold's photographer. ﻿Nice to meet you. ﻿Hi, ﻿Weren't you told that I'm coming ﻿For what? ﻿The photo shooting for "The 50 most influential women". ﻿I don't remember. ﻿Can you focus your gaze? ﻿What? ﻿You have this glassy, dead look. ﻿I'm a bit tired. ﻿Will you go to the Biennale along with your work? ﻿Which work? ﻿I don't know. I've read that this is a secret work. ﻿"This is not a chair" Can you look at me? ﻿With Jerusalem as a background, you're stunning. ﻿It's 6 o'clock, you'll be late. ﻿Nadine! ﻿What will I do with you? ﻿It's a MP3 player. ﻿I thought it was a bomb wire. ﻿If it were a bomb wire, you'd pull it and blow up too, moron. ﻿At least I'm on my toes. ﻿Etaca, good morning. ﻿Hi, I'm assembling one of your beds ﻿and I'm missing a screw. ﻿I'll put you through to the shift manager. ﻿Your name? ﻿Does it matter? ﻿What's your name? ﻿Fine, I'll put you through. ﻿Etaca, good morning. ﻿I got the bed I ordered and noticed that a screw is missing. ﻿A missing screw? ﻿That never happened to us. ﻿That's very strange. Are you sure? Did you count them? ﻿Come on. Are you kidding me? ﻿Put me through to your manager. ﻿Hold on. ﻿Hello. ﻿I'm Anna, the coordinator, we've talked on the phone. ﻿About what? ﻿I have an interview with you for German TV, ﻿the cultural report about influential women in Israel. ﻿You're Michal Kayam, aren't you? ﻿Right. ﻿Please, come in. ﻿Let me just finish this call, okay? ﻿Alright. ﻿Michal Kayam... ﻿Hello, are you the manager? ﻿Jerusalem regional manager. How can I help you? ﻿This is Michal Kayam. I'm missing a screw. ﻿I'm assembling a bed and I'm missing a screw. ﻿Excuse me? ﻿The instructions say there should be 5 screws, I got 4. ﻿- Are you sure? - Stop doubting what I'm saying. ﻿Hold on. ﻿Can we move some furniture? ﻿There's a German TV crew in my house. Instead of discussing my work, ﻿I'll tell them about your stuff and how I regret my purchase! ﻿No need to be upset. ﻿I'm not upset! ﻿I was promised 5 screws and I only got 4. ﻿And that secretary of yours tried to tell me that I'm a liar. ﻿Your website advertises kids with blonde hair. ﻿I don't want kids, I want a bed, that's all! ﻿Ma'am, please calm down. We will fix this. ﻿I'll make sure the worker who did that will be fired. ﻿You don't have to fire... ﻿We're ready. ﻿Have a wonderful day, and again, I apologize. ﻿That's not so bad... ﻿Goodbye. ﻿Nice tiles. ﻿Your work? ﻿This is an Arab house. ﻿Please, sit down. ﻿Head back. ﻿Close your eyes. ﻿Nadine Nasrallah? ﻿Are you in charge of putting screws in the bags? ﻿How many screws do you put in? ﻿Are you sure you put in 5? ﻿Someone very famous just called and complained that she got only 4. ﻿This can't happen at Etaca Jerusalem. ﻿We employ people, instead of machines, ﻿so that care is given to every screw. ﻿For the attention paid. ﻿Zadok tells me there's a problem with your work permit. ﻿Could you please show me your permit? ﻿You're fired. ﻿I'm sorry. ﻿Good luck. ﻿Bassam, I found someone. ﻿My neighbor. She seems suitable. ﻿Give me a day or two and I'll handle this. ﻿I'll call you later. My battery's dead. ﻿You have often said ﻿that you hardly feel anything. ﻿That you're never hot nor cold. ﻿I don't remember saying that. ﻿Let's talk about your conjugal life. ﻿Your husband's in high-tech, ﻿a far cry from what you do, ﻿and he's often overseas. ﻿I gather you hardly see each other. ﻿As a feminist, you must manage well on your own. ﻿A feminist? ﻿You say that having children •Is selfish. ﻿And that if you do have kids, ﻿you'll probably adopt a Palestinian child. ﻿Really? ﻿Did I say that? ﻿Tell us about your secret work, ﻿the one you're going to unveil at the Biennale next week. ﻿It's still a secret. ﻿What do you think about the road blocks? ﻿You formed a group of women artists from Jerusalem ﻿who stand 8-9 hours a day at the road blocks. ﻿Can we continue this some other time? ﻿The crew is going back in 4 days. ﻿She's not entirely here. ﻿If we go in Arabic, ﻿would it be easier? ﻿I don't speak Arabic. ﻿May I smoke? ﻿I've seen one of your interviews ﻿in which you insisted to speak Arabic. ﻿I have to make a phone call. ﻿Where to? ﻿I will be short. ﻿Let's finish this first. ﻿Please, sit down. ﻿As an artist ﻿who lives and creates here, ﻿do you think there's a chance for peace in the Middle East? ﻿Yes, there is, but... ﻿Let's continue tomorrow, I'm ﻿exhausted. I﻿'m sorry. ﻿Hello. ﻿He'll be back in 3 days, can you get it back by then? ﻿I think you're confused. ﻿Aren't you the computer guy? ﻿No. ﻿Are you from Etaca? ﻿No. ﻿We set an appointment for today. ﻿I can't do another interview or photo shoot. ﻿I've had a rough day, so whatever it is, can we do it some other day? ﻿You asked me to cook crabs for your anniversary. ﻿'Im a chef. ﻿Do you have a bathtub? ﻿Would you like to talk about the atmosphere? ﻿What does your husband like? ﻿What do you like? ﻿What do you do to create intimacy? ﻿Candles? ﻿Candles are good. ﻿Good, I'll bring candles. ﻿I told you the price over the phone, right? ﻿Remind me ﻿It's 3,000 shekels. ﻿It includes importing the crabs. ﻿But what makes it costly is the music. ﻿The music? ﻿I thought that's why you chose me. ﻿I play for them and they soften up. ﻿Crabs are hard to soften, ﻿because their skeleton is on the outside, ﻿unlike us. ﻿Their insides don't come in contact with the environment. ﻿So they can't be marinated, ﻿but you can play music for them. ﻿They feel the vibrations and react to it, ﻿crumbling from the inside. ﻿Melting. ﻿It's very tasty. ﻿You look hesitant. You can still call it off. ﻿No, of course not. ﻿My husband will be disappointed. ﻿You said he doesn't know. ﻿No, he knows nothing. ﻿Is there anything else you want? I ﻿don't know. ﻿Any fantasy? ﻿Excuse me. ﻿She has a good heart, that's what matters. ﻿My son needs special treatment. ﻿Bring him to me. ﻿Can she cook? Do the laundry? ﻿Their mother died last year, ﻿so she's still learning. ﻿Where's the father? ﻿He was arrested last month. ﻿I've been here ever since. ﻿We don't know when he'll be back. ﻿Why doesn't she have a man? ﻿She's special. ﻿My son doesn't need "special", he needs a wife. ﻿Just bring him over and we'll see. ﻿No use talking about it. ﻿Alright. ﻿I'll bring him over tomorrow. ﻿Who was here? ﻿What woman? ﻿This woman has a son. ﻿Shes seeking for a bride. ﻿She married him off twice, ﻿but he fled and returned home. ﻿There's nothing like Mother. ﻿Aunt Nazima wants us to send you to her, to Kuwait. ﻿She's willing to send money. ﻿Her boys used to beat me up. ﻿- They're grown up now. - So I bet they punch harder. ﻿Maybe you need a beating ﻿to bring you back to reality. ﻿I'll tell her to send the money. ﻿Mika! ﻿Inspect this one. ﻿Hello. ﻿Take off your clothes, please. ﻿Yes? ﻿Don't make a reservation yet. ﻿I told him my birthday is this Saturday. ﻿N°. forget it, rm sick of that, Mom. ﻿Make me a roast beef. ﻿Okay. But... ﻿I have to hang up. ﻿Me too, bye. ﻿What's this? ﻿Screws to mark my way. ﻿I have no sense of direction. ﻿I don't understand. ﻿I know how to get there, but not how to get back. ﻿Okay. ﻿Wait here. ﻿Get dressed. ﻿Come. ﻿Until we look into you. ﻿Michal Kayam? ﻿Who is this? ﻿- This is Tanya from the hospital. - What happened? ﻿We had to set a date for the follow-up, after the surgery. ﻿And also, where should I send the... ﻿- Surgery? - Where should I send the picnic cooler? ﻿I have two addresses in Venice, so I just want to make sure. ﻿I'll call your assistant. ﻿Good luck. ﻿Hi. ﻿I have a presentation to give in 10 min. How's your headache? ﻿Someone called from the hospital about an operation. ﻿Forget it, what's done is done. ﻿What's done? ﻿Does it matter? We can't undo it. ﻿You didn't even discuss it with me before you... ﻿You know that... children... ﻿I wanted... dad... ﻿I can't hear you. Can you hear me? ﻿I love you, Michal... ﻿sometimes... ﻿Damn. ﻿I'm losing you. ﻿And after what you did... ﻿I feel totally distant. ﻿Here you are. ﻿What did you say? ﻿Never mind. ﻿Give me a kiss. I'm running late. ﻿I can't. ﻿You can't... ﻿Okay. ﻿Bye. ﻿"Your dreams are just a double-click away" ﻿I'm telling you that I know her. She's my neighbor. ﻿don't care. ﻿Let her go. ﻿She's not right in the head. ﻿Okay, go. ﻿You can keep the cell phone. I noticed you don't have one. ﻿The soldiers are hassling you, huh? ﻿I can't talk now. ﻿I want us to meet. ﻿Then we'll meet. ﻿Wait for me tomorrow at 3 in the warehouse behind the factory. ﻿Now. ﻿We need somewhere quiet, remote. ﻿I know a place. ﻿Tell me where and I'll meet you there tomorrow at 3. ﻿It's now or never. ﻿What have you got there? ﻿All kinds of things. ﻿I collect what people lose. ﻿I remember what they forget. ﻿I see you leaving the house, ﻿putting on your headphones. ﻿You dance on the outside, but youre dead inside. ﻿No one should live that way. ﻿Look at yourself. ﻿You don't even know what you want. ﻿Whenever you wanted something, you never saw it through. ﻿I know this feeling. ﻿-I can help you... -A child. ﻿I want to have a child. ﻿And you, what do you want? ﻿"Self-made dreams" ﻿"Happiness comes in small packages" ﻿Its 9 Ma'ayan St., Ein Karem. ﻿Michal Kayam? ﻿Yes. ﻿Nissan! Hurry up. ﻿What? ﻿Excuse me? ﻿What...? ﻿Excuse me. ﻿Sir... ﻿- Do you need help assembling them? -I didn't order anything. ﻿Are you Michal Kayam? ﻿Yes, but I didn't buy any of this. ﻿No, it says here that it's free. ﻿"Refund gifts". ﻿Enjoy. ﻿I was told you were missing a screw. ﻿"Look for lost people." ﻿Nadine! ﻿Nadine! ﻿Go... ﻿Look for lost people. ﻿I know who I am and what I want. ﻿- To sort out screws? - To live. ﻿You call this living? ﻿Resentment at the checkpoints? ﻿Humiliation, serving the Jews? ﻿What do you get out of it? A bullet. ﻿Is that what you want? ﻿If you want, you can be a hero. ﻿Your pretty eyes will look out from huge posters. ﻿I don't want to be famous. ﻿You are really special. ﻿I've heard all about you. You say that to 10 women every day. ﻿Usually, I don't mean it. ﻿Your mother. ﻿Would you drink something? ﻿No, thank you. ﻿I'd switch places with them. ﻿Getting soft in the bathtub... ﻿Imagining I'm somewhere else. ﻿On some isolated beach, under a palm tree, ﻿at sunset... ﻿I need some privacy with them. ﻿Hi. ﻿You have to see the view. ﻿Its amazing. ﻿Can we talk later? ﻿Actually, they really liked my software. ﻿Ill stay two more days. ﻿But they'll die. ﻿Who will die? ﻿What are we gonna do? ﻿I don't know. ﻿Nothing... ﻿Nothing makes sense anymore. ﻿What's behind you? ﻿That? ﻿It's a playpen. ﻿It's the only thing that I managed to assemble. ﻿Nice, right? ﻿You bought it? ﻿No, I didn't. ﻿I got it. We got it. ﻿I don't get it... ﻿A playpen? ﻿Excuse me? ﻿The door was open. ﻿Hold on, someone has come. ﻿Where's the laptop? ﻿The computer technician is here. ﻿A playpen, what for? ﻿My car is double-parked. ﻿I prepared you a surprise. ﻿I don't want any surprises. ﻿I want normal. ﻿Hurry up, before my car gets towed. ﻿Give it to him. ﻿Unbelievable! ﻿You're two days late, and you cant give me a second to speak with my husband? ﻿Shame on you! ﻿It was fantastic. ﻿Is it true what they say? ﻿Are you dating our neighbor? ﻿You know in what hes involved? - Don't worry, I want to live. ﻿You want to live, but you're already dead. ﻿I spoke to Aunt Nazima. Tomorrow you're going to Kuwait. ﻿- Well be better off. -I like it here. ﻿Here, where? In your head? ﻿You can take it with you. ﻿Michal Kayam "Rolling From The Inside Out" ﻿This is where Michal Kayam's new work will be displayed. ﻿It will be unveiled at the Biennale, then displayed here. ﻿She says that it's her boldest piece to date. ﻿I assume she will continue to test and explore the pain threshold, ﻿as she has done in her works up to now. ﻿She likes to push... ﻿the boundaries, ﻿especially the moment when something becomes irreversible. ﻿Now, let's all enter the theater and watch Kayam talk ﻿about her new piece for the Biennale. ﻿Please follow me. ﻿I came to say goodbye. ﻿Come in. ﻿I can't, ﻿give me sometime. ﻿Bassam.. ﻿I'll find another girl. ﻿The boy will do it, but someone must go with him. ﻿Are you coming with me? ﻿Where to? ﻿To paradise. ﻿What are you doing here? You came too early. ﻿You did not tell me when to come. ﻿I have a math exam. If we leave, I wont have to pass it. ﻿Go to school. Take the exam. ﻿I failed 3 times, if I fail again, my father will kill me! ﻿"A bike rider left at 7:00 at a speed of 35 km per hour. ﻿Another bike rider left at 7:30 ﻿at a speed of 26 km per hour. ﻿"At what time will they meet?" ﻿Depends how many checkpoints there are on the way. ﻿Just say that you're bad at math too. ﻿Do you have anything to calculate with? ﻿A calculator? ﻿What are these screws? ﻿That's what I have left. They helped me a lot. ﻿Do they have special powers? ﻿The powers of the hands that holds them. ﻿Thank you. ﻿When are you leaving? ﻿Is that a sunset or a sunrise? ﻿I don't know. ﻿Its a very old photography. ﻿Will you have a computer over there? ﻿So we could talk on Skype? ﻿It's a sunset. ﻿You'll see, ﻿we will have a child. ﻿I will attach two small handles, ﻿it will become a small purse, ﻿but it can stretch. ﻿After all, the baby can grow inside. ﻿You talk about it so easily. ﻿There's nothing sensational about it. ﻿It's like pulling a tooth. ﻿It's not the heart. ﻿But it's the organ that gives you the most precious of all, ﻿your child. ﻿And if I don't want children, Does that make me a criminal? ﻿Extracting intentionally your womb is an extreme act. ﻿Yes, life is extreme, I only live once, ﻿I feel that I must... ﻿You must what? ﻿Well, to go inside in order to get something out. ﻿In order to express something. That's the only way I can... ﻿Feel? ﻿Before the extraction, ﻿you filmed yourself painting your womb with medical devices. ﻿Is there an ultrasound video? ﻿-Yes. - Let's watch it. ﻿It's hard to see here. ﻿In fact, it's fluorescent violet. ﻿I don't know what it will look like. It will add interest to the thing... ﻿It will be a surprise. ﻿And now, after it has been taken out... ﻿The womb will turn into a purse. ﻿Women love purses, ﻿maybe even more than their kids. ﻿This purse will travel around the world ﻿and it will empower women... ﻿Michal Kayam? ﻿It's the third time I've come to see your exhibition. ﻿I really like the yellow flowers printed on stone. ﻿This saturated yellow, full of hope. ﻿It's not me. ﻿Its strong, that's what I love about you. ﻿Nothing is taken for granted. ﻿I need a picture with you to show my students. ﻿One more... ﻿Open up! ﻿Open the door, you lunatic! ﻿I'm going to call the security guard. ﻿Excuse me. ﻿Excuse me! ﻿There's a woman in there. ﻿She threw out my cell phone! ﻿- She locked the door. - Ma'am, open the door! ﻿She's crazy! ﻿- What's her name? - Michal Kayam. ﻿Michal, can you hear me? ﻿God knows what she's doing in there. ﻿Michal, open the door. ﻿I'm counting to three, before breaking in. ﻿One, ﻿two, ﻿three. ﻿Stay away from the door. ﻿Our aunt promised to take good care of you ﻿like mother. ﻿Your bag. ﻿Open the bag. ﻿You open it. ﻿- Open it. - You open it to inspect it. ﻿Don't you understand Hebrew?

It wasn't a real shot. ﻿It's not a real bullet, it's a rubber one. ﻿It's a bullet wrapped in rubber, you see? ﻿It's an Israeli patent. ﻿It doesn't kill, it just hurts. ﻿You want some water? ﻿Hey, you! ﻿Excuse me. ﻿Does this look like a show to you? ﻿Please come with me. ﻿Sit over here. ﻿Soldier! ﻿Why is she being detained? ﻿Who's she? ﻿She's famous.

Please enter the desired destination. ﻿"Sea" ﻿Start driving. ﻿In 100 meters, turn right. ﻿"Let's escape from the asphalt ﻿"And from the crumpled cities" ﻿Drive straight. ﻿"Let's escape ﻿"to the peaceful lagoons ﻿"Come to Eilat, to Eilat..." ﻿In 300 meters, turn right. ﻿Prepare to reach your destination. ﻿You've reached your destination. ﻿I decided to stay here a bit longer, ﻿to think. ﻿You look wonderful. ﻿I'm pregnant. ﻿Is that for the Biennale? ﻿"Biennale"? ﻿Nice name, but... ﻿I think it's a boy. ﻿Sometimes I envy you. ﻿The way you change so easily. ﻿It's nice... ﻿from afar. ﻿I'll go jogging before it starts to rain. ﻿Bye. ﻿We came today, just like we said. ﻿We're sorry to disturb you, but we have to finish today. ﻿Come, sit down. ﻿- What do you want? - Only to ask you a few questions. ﻿We know how busy you are. Come. ﻿Head back. ﻿Close your eyes. ﻿What do you think about the road blocks? ﻿You formed a group of women artists from Jerusalem... ﻿who stand 8-9 hours a day at the road blocks. ﻿No. I stand there for 3-4 hours at the most. ﻿- What do you hear there? - Music, hip-hop. ﻿What do you see? ﻿An orange peel/ ﻿peeling nail polish, ﻿a baby muttering, ﻿a gleaming bead of sweat, ﻿a purse, ﻿rubber bullet, ﻿a flower brooch. ﻿A flower brooch, ﻿a rubber bullet... ﻿Could you powder her please? She's a bit glossy. Don't touch me. Damn! ﻿Let's watch one of her first video installations. ﻿We're shooting. ﻿Speak. ﻿Go on.
