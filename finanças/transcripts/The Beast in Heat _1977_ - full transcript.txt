(tense, dramatic music) (The Beast grunting) - This is the last injection of Depodroxina I'm administering to the subject in my experiment. The effects of which should confer precisely with the status we've conducted up to this point. Don't you agree, doctor? You seem to be perplexed. - That is quite true. Because I think what we're doing isn't quite correct. No one can play God, cynically trying to change the nature of a human being like we're doing here. - You surprise me. You're actually preaching to me. I'd never have known that, despite your scientific mind, you have a priest's heart. - No, Dr. Kratsch. I am a human being and can only deplore what you're doing here to these poor creatures. — If that's how you feel, I feel sorry for you. If your conscience is worrying you so much for helping me in these experiments, I'll erase your name and take all the credit for this tremendous discovery. And as far as your God is concerned, well, you should know that we Germans have always had him behind us. It's an exclusive privilege of our race. (The Beast grunting) There we are. Now he's ready to give us the demonstration that would make the god Eros go green with envy. - Dr. Kratsch, I beg you, listen to reason. Don't go too far. Can't you be satisfied with the results so far? The price the human race would have to pay could be too high. Your studies could create a biological catastrophe. (chuckles) - Are you so worried, on my behalf, or on yours? Nothing to say? Let's proceed. I'm certain that my creature will give you a demonstration of its virility that no human being could be capable of imagining. You will see, dear doctor, and appreciate the immolation of the chosen virgin who, without realizing it, will be sacrificing herself to science. Hm. Very well. Open that door. - Come. (woman whimpering) - Hm. You're very pretty. I can tell that you'll be appreciated. - [Female Guard] She was chosen from the special batch. - So you must be one of those who refuse to collaborate. Am I right? Well now, you'll find out for yourself that we Germans aren't nearly as bad as we're painted, you know. Come on. Don't be frightened. I only want you to experience a moment of intense pleasure. (screaming) (The Beast grunting) - No! No, no! (grunting) No! (screaming) (The Beast grunting) - What are you screaming for, you silly fool? After all, my creature's only showing you a little tenderness. (woman screaming) (The Beast grunting) - [Woman] No, no! (screaming) No! No! (screaming) (The Beast grunting) No. (screaming) (The Beast grunting) (woman sobbing) (grunting) No. No. No. - Tell me. Do you find the spectacle exciting, Private Schultz? - Yes, of course. Who wouldn't be excited? (Slaps) (grunts) - Spineless fool. A soldier of the Third Reich isn't supposed to get excited at any spectacle. (woman sobbing) (The Beast grunting) (screaming) (The Beast grunting) (breathing heavily) And you, how do you find the experiment? - Excellent. I think you're a genius. You're wonderful, Dr. Kratsch. (tense, dramatic music) (The Beast grunting) — And I suppose they'll decorate you, too. (tense, dramatic music) (The Beast grunting) (tense, dramatic music) (train whistle blows) (tracks rattling) - Now. (grunting) (tense, dramatic music) (gunfire) — Step on it! The train'|| be through any minute. (mumbles) (tense, dramatic music) (train whistle blows) Quick. - I'm coming. — Come on, hurry up. (grunts) (tense, dramatic music) (track rattling) (whistle blowing) Come on, it's already connected. What the hell are you waiting for? — Why don't you shut up? You just can't hurry these things, you know. (track rattling) (explosion) That's it. - But you blew the bridge after the train had passed. - Naturally. That train's full of soldiers. Too many people are dying uselessly. - Are you crazy or somethin'? You tell me whose side are you on. — That's a stupid question and you know it. I'm going down to the village. Tell Moreno that the other bridges have been primed with explosives, so I need three hours notice before blowing them. (birds chirping) - Hm. The creation of an artificial master race. Allow me to toast your genius, Dr. Kratsch. Your studies, of course, are going to revolutionize the accepted concept of humanity. I should be more than happy to speak of this to the Fuhrer personally when I get back to Berlin. - Thank you, General Von Kruessen. We still haven't been able to totally master a human being's mind, but we are capable of taking all will power from conquered enemies and so turn them into willing slaves to work as beasts of burden for the glory of the great Third Reich. - It's really quite incredible. Have you ever thought of trying out your experiment on still friendly nations? Hm. All it would need... Yes? What is it? — I am sorry, General Von Kruessen, but it's urgent. — I especially gave orders not to be disturbed. What has happened? What is so urgent? — I'm sorry to say the partisans have committed another act of sabotage. — And you come here and disturb me just for that? - They blew up the Lambertoni Bridge. - What? But that bridge is essential to us. - Yes, I realize it's important to our eventual retreat. — What the devil are you talking about? I especially gave command of that to Captain Hardinghauser, so will you kindly get him on the phone? I wish to find out what the hell he's doing about it. - [Doretta] Heil Hitler. — You're an obscene whore, that's what you are. If all Italians were like you, no one would come here to make war. (Doretta chuckles) - If all Italian women were like me, we'd destroy you without firing a shot. — Love is your reason for living, but that of my country is to wage war. — I'll soon change your mind. (moaning) (heavy breathing) (phone ringing) - Damn. (phone ringing) Who the hell is it calling at this hour? At your service, general. - Listen, captain, I wanted to inform you that the partisans in your area have committed another act of sabotage. As a soldier, you are useless. (grunts) Now listen to me, Hardinghauser, over a period of five months, you seem to have been incapable of bringing to heel a few small season country clods. It seems to me you seem to be unaware of the enormous gravity of this last attack. The Lambertoni Bridge was of vital strategic importance to us, if you didn't realize it, playing as it did an important line both for for victualing and for munitions. And how am I going to explain to the Fuhrer that a bridge personally entrusted to you by me no longer exists? - Bridge? But, General Von Kruessen, that bridge is guarded day and night by my men. — [General Von Kruessen] And your men went with the bridge. - Well, this is the first I've heard of it. - [General Von Kruessen] You are an idiot. - But, general. — [General Von Kruessen] Start the investigation. - But that's impossible. - How dare you dispute my orders, Hardinghauser. You'll answer for this insubordination as well. Meanwhile, try and act like a soldier. You've received your orders so go and search for and round up all the partisans you can find on both sides of the river and make them talk. Or do I have to instruct you on how to do that too? — Of course, yeah. Jawoll, General. - Yeah, yeah, jawoll, General. Is that all you can say to me is yeah? You are completely useless. — Yeah. —Ah. As you can see, my dear, it's not easy dealing with half wits. (tense, dramatic music) - [Ellen] Yes, but they have their uses, too. - Lieutenant Mueller. Mueller. — Yes, Captain? — Don't just stand there like a dummy. - Of course not, sir. - I've just had a call from General Kruessen who very kindly informed me that the partisans have blown up the Lambertoni Bridge. You knew the strategic importance of that bridge. Explain yourself. I don't know why you didn't inform me earlier. You'll be court-martialed for dereliction of duty. - You gave me express orders that you weren't to be disturbed for any reason at all. - Are you trying to justify your mistakes? Have the whole area closely searched. We must flush out these partisans once and for all. Meanwhile, arrest 10 or so men, taken at random from the families in the village. - But there are only women, old men, and children left. - Right. The fathers, wives, and children of those bandits. We will search all the young women that fall into our hands. - [Lieutenant Mueller] Yes, sir. (tense, dramatic percussive music) (yelling in foreign language) (women yelling) (soldiers yelling in foreign language) (yelling) (grunting) (yells) (gunfire) - Go away, leave us alone, get out of here. Stop, get out. Leave us alone. (yelling) (baby Crying) Get out! Get out. Go! Pigs, pigs. Get off her, you Pigs! No! No, no! My baby! No, my baby! No! No! (gunfire) No! (gunfire) (sobbing) (dramatic, melancholy music) - They won't talk. They're old, men and women and children, but they're our people, and they all think like we do. What is worrying me is that they might catch Stefano. He's far too precious to our cause. There's not one of us who can avoid ambushes like he can. - We haven't much time if you're going to save at least some of the prisoners. I'm afraid that this time we won't be able to rely on Captain Hardinghauser's stupidity. He's like a mad, ferocious beast if his dignity as a soldier is ever questioned, and the general gave him such a blast on the phone that he jumped out of his skin. - You're a clever girl, Doretta. You and your sister Irene are loyal patriots. Now you must go down to the village, by yourself, and try and trace Stefano and find out what the Germans are up to. - That shouldn't be too difficult. They know me, but they also know I'm Hardinghauser's mistress. I'll be back as soon as I can, take care of yourselves. - The trouble is that the villagers know about it, too. That can't make the girl's life any easier. Poor Doretta. - We can't allow for sentiment in our struggle against the Germans. Aldo, call up Moreno. Tell him to keep himself ready, but not to move until I say so. - [Aldo] Hello? — As soon as the Germans decide to retreat, we'll put a combined operation into action, a lesson that they'll never forget. We must have faith. — [Aldo] They don't answer. Lupo calling Moreno, come in. — You did a good job on that bridge, but we're going to make them sweat blood. - I was thinking of those in the village. They had nothing to do with it. - Lupo calling Moreno, come in. (birds chirping) — For God sakes, it's blown another valve. (birds chirping) I can't get Lupo, the damn radio's gone off again. - Ah, it's indeed serious. We haven't got a lot of time, damn it. — As far as I'm concerned, it looks dangerous. Why don't we move on? - Move on where? Have you all gone mad or something? We must wait for Drago at 8:30. We have no other choice. Our operation must be very well coordinated. - What coordination if our radio's out of service? If you think that Drago will make it here in time, you must be an optimist. - Don't make me laugh. His job is to blow up bridges, but also to make sure there aren't any victims. (laughing) - And not only that, but to run after Don Lorenzo to examine his soul. - He's a card, that priest. You know, I've never trusted fellas of the cloth, just never did. And I don't suppose old red beard's any different. - Well. Up until now, he's provided us with food, hasn't he? — That's true, but he could be playing a double game like that whore, Elara. I suppose you remember who I'm talkin' about. — That's what gets up my nose. We seem to be at the mercy of priests and prostitutes. (laughing) - You all know quite well how Elara's been useful to us. And now just because we've had no news of her since yesterday, you consider her an enemy. You're just a bunch of hysterical old women. You, go back to your observation post and stop talking nonsense. See if Caralta is coming. — Okay, Okay- (birds chirping) (man yelling in foreign language) (men grunting) (tense, dramatic music) - Well, well, well. Hm. Bring me that old man and go and get the child. (tense, dramatic music) (birds chirping) (tense, dramatic music) (tense, dramatic music) - Follow me. (tense, dramatic music) (strange, dramatic music) (tense, dramatic music) (barrel rolling) (clicking) — Up until now, you've been fortunate. There's been one bullet in the chamber, but this time, you may not be so lucky. So why don't you talk? - But I don't know anything. - You had a gun and your pocket's full of cartridges. You'd like to convince me you're just a simple old man, but I'll make you talk. Come here, you little brat. You know where the partisans are, don't you? Your father's with them too, come on. Where's your father? Do you want me to force it out of you? - Think of grandmother. That'll help you resist, my child. - Don't listen to him. Hm? (child sobbing) I swear. If you don't tell me all you know, I'll roast you alive. (sobbing) Well? — You must be desperate if your fear of us is so great that you can stoop to menacing children. - Shoot him. Shoot him, I said. (barrel rolling) (clicking) (child sobbing) (gunshot (child sobbing) (melancholy music) - Heil Hitler. Lieutenant Ellen Kratsch of general command. - Heil Hitler. I'm sorry I kept you waiting. - [Ellen] That's all right. — You're very kind. Unfortunately, serious problems came up and had to be dealt with. Won't you sit down? — Thank you captain. - Would you care for a drink? — Have you any brandy? - Yes, luckily I have. - As you probably already know, I've been secondered to you to give you a hand. Certainly not to replace you. Everyone is aware of your extreme devotion to the Third Reich and to the just cause for which we are all fighting this war. - Thank you, lieutenant, that's very civil of you. Perhaps you know that partisans aren't soldiers, but bandits. And in order to root them out, we need special combat forces. — You want special combat troops? (laughs) Come, come, captain. It ought to be enough to make the others talk. Don't you think? - They're quite fanatical. They'd rather die than squeal. (match lights) - I don't want to talk out of turn, captain, but could it be that your method is wrong? - Well, if you can point one out that is better, I'd be more than happy to implement it. - I can suggest one that is infallible. - What's that, then? - It's a system with feminine characteristics. - Oh, yes? — Sweetness, with a dash of sexual stimulus. - Hm, sweetness. But that's a prerogative of the angels. But you, from what I've heard, enjoy a reputation of being rather a devil, lieutenant. - Oh, really? And what do you prefer? An asexual angel, or an exciting devil? - Well. Let's say, an angelic devil. - Wonderful. If that's how you feel, perhaps you won't mind if we deal with the problem in my way, and I assure you that very soon, you will have these swine under lock and key, you'll see. With a minimum of energy, and not counting the fact we'd be combining business with rare pleasure. — [Captain Hardinghauser] You paint an attractive picture. - Hey you got a match? Here, give us a drag of that fag. - Move your wheel, you slut. (men laugh) - [Man] Look who's there. - [Man In Pink Shirt] Hey Irene, if we all come, what's the discount? — The same discount your sister gives, eh. — Hey, the atrocity. — Yeah, so where do you get off getting on people's nerves, eh? Ugh. - Hey, hoity toity, who does she think she is? - That's right, why don't you tell us where you're going and what are you doing day and night? — Look, I do what I like and with whom I want to, bumpkin. — Oh, so you don't like bumpkins. - No, I don't. Why don't you go and do some work you layabout, or go and fight? - I'll screw Germans like you. - Hang on, we'll have some fun with her. (laughing) - [Irene] No, don't, I'm warning you. Don't any of you dare come near me and if you do, I'll let you have it, I will. No, no! Put me down. Don't make me. Put me down, you bastards. Leave me alone. I'll fix you for this. - Come on, I'll drip some water on her. (splashing) — I know, sure, I know. It's too bad, it's also your fault. Let them retreat. After all, the Americans-- - No, no quota. In a farm house nearby they tortured two women to death because they wouldn't reveal their husband's whereabouts. They set fire to houses, murdered young children and you stand there and say-- - I know. But your hands aren't too clean. Killing, endless killing. Is that all we can do? Everyone's doing it these days. - Not everybody. Unfortunately, I'm incapable of killing. It's something inside me. But if they wanna cross bridges, they're gonna have to swim. And while they're swimming, the other day, Goofo picked off seven of them all by himself. - Seven men? Oh dear God. Oh dear God, forgive us. Seven men murdered by one alone. But Drago, do you realize Jesus taught us we must always—— - Don Lorenzo, we realize that if we don't strike first, it'll be the Germans killing us. And as far as what Jesus taught, well, I'm not too bright. But I remember when we were in the trenches, the chaplain used to preach that killing one's enemies was truly one of God's divine commandments. I'm sorry, Don Lorenzo. Whoever understands you priests must be very clever. Even Mussolini was considered by the church to be a man sent by providence, do you remember? - But what has the church to do with God? Oh. What are you making me say? Oh Jesus, forgive us. Whatever race we may belong to, to forgive others, that is what we must learn to do. - That is something the Germans must also learn to do. Those who are shooting against us. — Enough. Now you must go. When Christina comes, I'll send along the provisions I've got. - Thank you, Don Lorenzo. I know how difficult it is for you to help us. But the Germans have plundered every single thing within the range of 50 kilometers and we must maintain our position at any cost. We're awaiting orders. - Yes, I see. If anything interesting comes up, I'll let you know through usual channels. (door opens) (Irene sobbing) — Irene. What are you doing here? What's happened? - Come my child, sit down. — Oh Don Lorenzo, those wicked boys are saying I'm a German spy, and they're at it, too. - But what do you care what people say? We know quite well what you're doing for us, okay? - Don't worry, my child. You're now in God's house, and nothing will happen to you here. You're quite safe. - No one is safe, I tell you, padre. And the awful thing is that... one of us has betrayed the partisans and the Germans are on their way over here. They know all about the partisans and they don't trust me anymore. I tried to come as quickly as I could, father, but those layabouts held me up and they wouldn't let me pass. That's why I was so late. Drago, hurry, go and warn our companions. They're in grave danger. Go, now. — Go. Don't worry Drago, we'll come through this somehow. - [Irene] Yes, please, go. - Yes, but, Irene, my wife is an ill woman. My boy is almost alone at home. - Don't worry. I'll look after your boy for you, Drago. And I'll help your wife to get better. - Thank you, Irene. I knew I could rely on you to look after them. I knew you wouldn't let me down, Irene. — Just a minute, Drago. (soft music) Here, take this rosary. It's mine. The Lord won't betray you. He's the best, and if you have a moment, pray for me too, sometimes. It'll all be all right. (soft music) - The position couldn't be worse. Damn it. (radio buzzing) For God sake, try that radio again. — It's been all day I've been fiddlin' with this box of tricks. Moreno's radio must be out of commission. Corville receives me. He's ready, awaiting your orders. - Well, why hasn't Doretta come back? And Drago, Stefano? (fire crackling) I'm sorry to have to say it boys, but I think we've been screwed. — Thank God you're here, Lupo. We've been caught napping. The hills are crawling with Germans, and the lower road is teeming with armored cars and tanks. — What are you talkin' about? Doretta was certain that—— - But I just talked to Irene. Someone's betrayed us, possibly one of Moreno's boys. We don't know. Or a woman. Anyway, someone that knows all of us. - Fuckin' bitch, fuckin' traitor. And Stefano—- - I don't know. It seems he got away. But if he did, it was sheer luck. — Let's hope he did. We must warn Moreno's lot. There's no time to lose. Otherwise, they'll fall into a trap. They're in a dangerous position. - If you want me to, I'll go, Lupo. - No. There are too few of us left. And anyway, you'd waste too much time. You don't know this area too well. — So why don't we send Christina? The girl who brings the provisions? It'd be easy for her. (fire crackling) - Perhaps you're right. We have no other alternative. (tense percussive music) (speaking in foreign language) (tense percussive music) — [Boy] Quick, the Germans are coming. Quick, run, the Germans are coming. (tense percussive music) (soldier speaking in foreign language) - [Woman] The Germans, the Germans. (soldiers speaking in foreign language) — But my boy, you couldn't have chosen a worse time to come home. The Germans are arresting people daily. We have no peace, we've had no peace since they came here. They're like mad bulls. They stop at no atrocity. They're even shooting children, they don't care what they do. Day and night, you can't go out-- - Mother! Try and calm down. I've come to get these provisions. Don Lorenzo is expecting me. Someone had to do it. Look, I know how to evade those murderers. They won't catch me, you'll see. I'm much smarter than they are. — But don't you see, people are getting tired and someone will start talking. They're even now starting to arrest the women, you understand? — The women? - Yes, the women. They're choosing the youngest, and I've heard that a woman doctor's coming from the German headquarters and the things... - What sort of things? - Terrible things. They rape the girls, and if they still don't talk, they burn them alive. (door closes) - They're here. They're here. They're everywhere. They're taking another lot of girls. They're talking of murdering everyone if we don't reveal the partisan's hiding place. - Run away, run away, my boy. Those pigs, they'll kill you if they get you. - Okay. That's right. Very good. Let him escape, we can pay for them later. There you are all safe. Armed to the teeth, ready to shoot any German who comes into view. But how much does every dead enemy cost? Can you tell me that, Stefano? Can you tell me that? Have you thought what it costs us, you playing at heroes? — Perhaps you're right, Susanna. I'll wait for them to give myself up. It's not fair that you'll die for an idea that you don't believe in. Possibly because nobody's taken the time out to explain it to you. - [Soldier] Open up! (banging) Open up. - No, Stefano, no. - Leave me be, I've made up my mind. (hits) (Stefano grunts) - Quick, help me get him into the cupboard. (soldier yelling) (banging) - Hm. Well, well. Ladies, I'd like to know where your son Stefano is. Come on, speak damn it. - Since he joined the Socialist Republic, I haven't heard a word from him of any kind. (laughs) - Socialist Republic. Well, perhaps you can help, Miss Lipson. You'll tell me 'cause you don't want the old woman to get hurt, am I right? Huh, am I right? (Susanna gasps) - No. (slaps) - No, don't hurt her, please. Oh no, leave me alone, let me go. Let me go. - Hold on to the old bag. You two, come here. (grunting) Hold her down. - [Susanna] Oh no. No, what are you doing? Let me go. - And you, scream as much as you'd like. — [Susanna] No, stop it please. Let me go, please. — Please don't hurt her. - [Head Soldier] We shall see who will crack first. - [Susanna] Oh, please no. - No, kill me instead. Don't hurt her. - No don't, please no. — [Mother] She doesn't know anything. She doesn't know anything. - [Susanna] Stop it, stop it, no. No, stop it, get off me, you pig. (sobbing) Leave me, leave me alone. No. Stop it, leave me alone. No, no. Leave me alone! Stop it! Please, stop it. Leave me alone. Help! Stop, Stop- — You filthy swine, you cows! - Don't shoot, I want him alive. That's right. Take him away. - [Stefano] Let go of me, you swine. Let go. — Young fool. I could never allow my race to have any relations with yours. (tense, dramatic music) (gunshot (birds chirping) - [Man] Oh, we're sick to death of waitin'. I don't see why we gotta hang around here all the time just 'cause the radio's broke. If you ask me, I think we oughta attack. — We've got precise orders to wait until the German Colonels will be on retreat. That's the only way we can have any affect on the Germans, concentrated as they will be on the roads. - But that's crazy, we ought to be knocking out the German general headquarters. That way, we'll have 'em by the short and curly. - Certainly. The Germans might even anticipate their departure. - Why don't, why don't we find out what the boys at the lower base know. Surely their radio can't be out of action too? - What if they're expecting news from us? Witzery, you know this country around here like the palm of your hand. - Oh, it'd take me three hours to get there and back. - I'll come with you. - No, it's better I go alone. - I think that is right. You go together. A man and a woman could arouse much less suspicion. You send her ahead and then you follow carefully. If you're not back by nightfall, well, we start the attack then. Now you better be going. And be very careful because you're very useful to us. — Hm, I don't wanna be a wet blanket, but I have nasty feeling that something isn't right. — Yes, Cheech is right. There is somethin' wrong somewhere. I can feel it in my bones. - Eh, don't talk such superstitious nonsense. You better get back at that radio and try to repair it. Did you all get neurotic or something? We got to wait for Drago, I hope he can bring some good news. — Drago. He'll almost certainly be having a talk with his priest. - Hm. (tense music) — Very good work, captain. Very good indeed. A lovely selection and just right for my purposes. I must congratulate you. - Thank you, lieutenant. — A connoisseur's choice. - Well, with all the material available, we had some difficulty in making the choice. They're all either sisters or girlfriends of those damn partisans. — Choosing was difficult you say? Don't be absurd. They're all so interesting, each and every one pretty. I won't hurt a hair of their heads. Don't worry, my dears. The captain and I look at things from a different point of view. (spits) Lovely. (tense music) Lovely in character, too. Later on, I'll get to know you even better, my spirited little fawn. Shall we go? — [Captain Hardinghausen] You two, stay as guards at the foot of the stairs. - We must be strong girls. Even if they torture us to death. Because even if we do talk and betray our men folk, those swine'|| kill us all the same. So be strong, resist. - As I said before, I'm sick to death of Moreno playing at being cheap. What I don't understand is how someone like you takes his orders when it's you who ought to be cheap. — Oh, shut up for God's sake and let's try and avoid the Germans. Now that I think about it, the idea of going to the other group was yours. - Certainly. And I've got my own good reasons. I'm bored with this war. Risking our necks for the politicians. And then getting a kick up the backside for our pains. That is, if we're still alive. — What did you expect? Honors and medals? Or perhaps a heap of money to hide under the floor? - You said it. (men groaning) (tense music) (grunting) (groaning) (tense music) (groaning) - Captain, would you give me the pleasure of participating in this experiment? - I can't wait to see your methods. (laughs) (hits) (grunts) — So you're still able to look upon me as a women, aye? (laughs) (hits) (grunts) Ah, Stefano Pallermi. Did you know we've also got your little fiancee here? Would you rather be with her, or do you find me more exciting? — You're just a bitch on heat. (tense, dramatic music) - Look at me. Are you frightened of me? - I'm not frightened, you disgust me. - Oh really? You're not disgusted with me. You're frightened. (laughs) Because I'm going to make you talk, you see. (tense, dramatic music) (heavy breathing) - [Man In The Middle] Don't waste time with that boy. Come here, come here with me. Come here! (yells) I want you! (yells) I want you before I die. (yells) (heavy breathing) (tense music) (yelling) (tense music) (man groaning) - [Ellen] That's just a little sample. The fun's just beginning. (man yelling) — They're coming our way. (birds chirping) (tense music) (tense, dramatic music) - I'm glad you arrived punctually, Mara. — You brought the money with you I hope. - Here it is. — The agreed amount? - But of course. — What about the safe conduct? - There is no safe conduct. - What? But you promised me. How will I cross the lines? — You filthy traitoress. (GUN clicks) - I'm sorry, Witzery, but I can see I did the right thing in taking the cartridges out. Ha, listen to reason. Come away with me. Stop playing at being a hero. The medals you get won't buy you anything. I'm quite willing to share this money with you if you decide to come away with me. Come on. - You foul bitch. (gunshot) (yells) (groans) - Stupid fool. Good bye, Franz. — Good bye, Mara. — Lousy bitch. (tense music) (birds chirping) Angry bitch! (slapping) (grunting) Bitch! To the butchers, huh? Huh? (grunting) You bitch! (gunshot (Mara grunts) (gunshots) (gunshot (groans) (gunshots) (tense music) — The Germans are here! We're surrounded! (explosion) (explosion) (yells) — Come on, quickly boys. You two behind the wall there. The others, behind the ruins. (gunfire) (men yell) (gunshots) (soldier yells) (gunfire) (gunshots) (soldier groans) (hits) (grunts) (hits) (grunts) (hitting) (grunting) (explosion) (men yelling) (explosion) (men yelling) (gunfire) (exploding) (gunfire) (exploding) (yelling) (gunfire) (explosions) (gunfire) (gunfire) (tense music) (yelling) (gunshots) (gunshot) (solder yells) (gunfire) (tense music) (soldiers yelling in foreign language) (grunts) (exploding) (men yelling) (gunfire) (exploding) (gunshots) (tense music) (gunfire) (gasps) - Look out, there's a hand grenade! Get out fast! (exploding) (yelling) (gunfire) (tense music) - Christina, get the hell out of there. (gunfire) (tense music) (spits) (exploding) (gunfire) (screaming) (grunting) (whimpering) (buzzing) - Just a caress, and she'll never be able to resist. (screaming) (buzzing) When she can stand it no more, she'll talk. (screaming) (screaming) (mice chittering) (grunting) (yelling) (Whipping) (yelling) (Screaming) (yelling) (screaming) — I swear. I don't know anything. (screaming) You're hurting me. (screaming) I can't stand anymore. Go and ask the priest. He knows all about the partisans. (screams) Go ask him. - Don't listen to her, she doesn't know what she's talking about. She's mad. I'm the only who has any information. I'm a partisan, I'm a partisan. I know what I'm talking about, you can only get information from me. - So you're a partisan? - Oh yes, that's right. - That's enough. (screaming) - You merry swine. (laughs) — A priest you say. But what a stroke of luck this should happen. A subject I study with great interest. - A pleasure I intend to share with you. I'll go personally and issue the invitations. — You murdering bastards. You can't play your vile games on innocent priests. Don Lorenzo doesn't know anything. I'm the only one who can help you, I tell you. (laughing) — So he's called Don Lorenzo, is he? You can't do a thing, my poor little Italian. (laughs) Not for now, anyway. Anyhow, you're too late. (laughs) (The Beast grunting) (screaming) (mice chittering) - Carry on with your fun. (mice chittering) (screaming) (screaming) (grunting) (tense, dramatic music) (screaming) (tense, dramatic music) (laughing) (screaming) (soft acoustic music) (birds chirping) - Drago, Drago. Drago, I've seen them, they're here already. There must be hundreds. There must be a whole battalion. They're on the other side of the hill. - Yeah, yeah I know, I saw them too. I'm on my way to warn the others. I hope to God they've got their wits about them. Listen, get down to the church and tell Don Lorenzo. We'll take over the provisioning, all right? — No, stop, Drago don't go. It's useless to go, you won't find anyone there. They've all either run away or they're dead by now. Can we back up when things are calm? Hide yourself, Drago. (soft acoustic music) (birds chirping) - That way. (birds chirping) Follow me. (birds chirping) (gasps) — There are Germans over there. Quickly Don Lorenzo, you must try and hide yourself somewhere, anywhere. I know how to hold them off. (birds chirping) — Oh. (laughs) At last, darling Adolf. I'm about ready for some fun. It's so boring up here. You know to find a handsome man nowadays is pretty tough. - A beautiful woman coming out of a parish house? Hm. Have you been converted, my dear? (Irene chuckles) And don't tell you've come to confess your little sins, hm? (chuckles) - Don Lorenzo is very kind. He always absolves me, even without confession. — Does he really? Hm. Hm, I'm intrigued to see whether he'll absolve me. It so happens that I want to talk to him. - But he's not in now. I rang his bell, but no one answers. Strange, well. I think, maybe, he's with one of his flock. Someone who's dying. - At this time of day? - He hasn't a nine to five job. - Come along, Irene, let's look for him together. If he's not at home, perhaps we'll find him in the church. (soldier speaks in foreign language) (gasps) (slaps) (screams) You're a stupid little bitch. We knew all along that you and your sister were playing a double game but we used you. You're a lot less clever than you really think. You're the parish priest for this area, aren't you? - I'd say you're very well informed. And very courteous. You had me worried there. - We are quite capable of being courteous with those who are friendly. And that is why I'm asking you courteously to collaborate with us. We have been told that you know all the partisans in this area. Therefore if you help us, I promise, you'll come to no harm and you'll be able to march with us to the final victory. But first you must give us the name of these bumpkins. (Irene whimpers) — These bumpkins, as you put it, are also children of God and I can see no earthly reason why I should betray them to you. Why should I? Would it bring back to life those that you've killed? The children that you've slaughtered? The women you've raped? The countryside you've razed to the ground? And please don't tell me it's part of a soldier's duty. It's a pity. You had a great civilization. Now you've become barbarians. (slaps) - That is for having insulted an officer of the Third Reich. For much less, at another time, I would have killed you. — Too many people have been killed for lesser reasons. Life of a priest isn't worth much. With that I'd agree. But I'm willing to sacrifice my life to save others. (speaks in foreign language) — I'll know how to make you talk. And you too will talk, you whore. (clattering) — Lord, God, forgive me! (grunting) (speaks in foreign language) (hits) (grunts) (Don Lorenzo grunting) (hits) (grunts) (speaks in foreign language) (hits) (hits) (grunts) (hitting) (grunting) (grunting) - [Drago] Hang on, Don Lorenzo. (hits) (grunts) (grunting) (hits) (grunt) — Come on, let's go. After all, that wasn't difficult. He's only a priest. Schmidt? See that bandit? Finish him off. Four minutes. (grunting) (soft music) (gunshot (exploding) (speaks in foreign language) (bombs whistling) (exploding) (gunfire) (Irene screams) (bombs whistling) (exploding) - [Christina] No! Let me go! Let go of me, you swine! (Christina sobbing) (melancholy music) (bombs whistling) (exploding) — Irene. Rene. (melancholy music) My poor child. (melancholy music) (plane flying overhead) (explosions) (Sighs) (birds chirping) (motorcycle puttering) - [Man] Halt! (speaking in foreign language) (birds chirping) (speaking in foreign language) Hey little boy, you tell me, are there any partisan in the hill? Huh, any bandits? Come on, talk. Oh, you poor bloke. Come on, talk to me. Tell me, any bandits that look Italian? (tense, dramatic music) (grunting) (hits) (Drago grunts) (hitting) (grunting) (grunting) (tense, dramatic music) - Here, nothing. — For God sakes, what is that crazy fool up to now? He should've been here more than an hour ago. - Perhaps he was with Clive by the bombardment. — Or perhaps he's chewin' the cud with Don Lorenzo. You know how he is. - Always got a little joke, huh, Mitchell? - Who's jokin'? - We'll wait another five minutes then we'll move on. — I'm very curious to make the acquaintance of this female doctor. - He's on his way here. Here he comes. — Where have you been? What the hell happened? Why are you so late? - They murdered Irene and arrested Christina and Don Lorenzo. - Well, what are we waitin' for? Let's get on with freein' 'em. - Lupo gives the orders here. — Come on, let's move on boys. Those Krauts are already in retreat. We must get there to the command post before they kill everyone. - I only hope we get there in time to save some of those poor people. - Take this then, and start using it. It's no crime to murder those beasts. (dramatic music) — Well, where are the other guys? — They should already be at their posts. - What are we waiting for? Let's join them. - Come on boys. (tense percussive music) (grunting) This way. (tense percussive music) (grunting) (tense percussive music) (gunfire) (exploding) (gunfire) (gunfire) (gunfire) (gunshots) (gunfire) - Follow me. (explosion) (men yelling) (explosion) (gunfire) (soldier yelling in foreign language) (explosion) (grunting) (exploding) (gunfire) (exploding) (gunfire) (soldier yells) (grunting) (whimpering) (laughing) — That's it, go to work my beauty. Show us your stuff. That's right, rape her. Show her no mercy. (laughing) (grunting) (screaming) You and me, we're going places. With that dong of yours, we'll conquer nations. That's it. (laughs) (grunting) (screaming) Guards, she's escaping. Shoot her. (gunshots) (screaming) (grunting) Help- Shoot him, help. Do something. Get away. Help me. Help- Oh no. (grunting) (yelling) Get him away from me. Oh, help me. (grunting) (yelling) Oh, take him away. (grunting) Stop- stop- stop- (grunting) (yelling) Oh no. (grunting) (yelling) Help me. Help- Help me, please. Oh. Help me, please. He's killing me. Oh, help. (grunting) (whimpering) (gunfire) (whimpering) (gunshots) (gunfire) (explosions) (plane puttering) (gunfire) (bombs whistling) (explosions) (melancholy music) - Luisa! Angelo! Angelo. Luisa. (melancholy music) My Angelo. Angelo. Angelo, my boy. Come. Come. (bombs whistling) (explosions) I'll take you to a safer place. (bombs whistling) (explosions) (exploding) (yelling) - [Christina] Don Lorenzo. What are we going to do? (hits) (grunts) - Quickly, this way. (bombs whistling) (explosions) (exploding) (Christina screams) (bombs whistling) (explosions) - [Christina] Oh. - Come on, Christina. (bombs whistling) (explosions) - It's really not such a bad thing to leave this crazy world. So full of evil and malice, you'll see. We're going to a wonderful new world where everything will be peaceful. Where no child will ever need to cry. — Drago, where are you going? - Where the light of goodness never fails to shine, shining as it does with so much charity on men of good will. - Drago, stop. I beg of you. - You, my darling child, will fly high in the sky as a winged horse. Yes, that's right. - Drago, listen to me. Drago, you must listen. - You will be an angel. - Where are you going? I beg of you, please. — Among angels. — Drago, look at this. — Pray, pray for us. — You'll be shot. Drago. - To go on struggling, struggling here. - Drago. Drago, come back here. [Drago] Oh, my God. If you didn't accept my prayers, please accept his. And so it shall come to pass that each man will embrace his neighbor and call him brother and then peace will finally reign on earth. (explosion) (melancholy music)
