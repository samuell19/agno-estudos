ANGEL GUTS: RED VERTIGO Mayako Katsuragi - Nami Naoto Takenaka - Muraki I'm sorry. You been out having fun with that guy? No. Things go wrong when you're not sleeping properly. Sure. Writer & Director Takashi Ishii l'll have to work over the holiday. Nami. l promised we'd see a movie. That's fine with me. - Has something gone wrong? - Huh? lt's come out fine. Take a seat. You haven't had a break, so you must be tired. I'm OK, I'm OK. Your work is what really counts. Who's this one? Pretty, isn't she? Which one? Oh, her. She works in cabaret. She's a dog. A dog. There've been a lot recently... ... pictures of the girl. Really? lt's all done according to what seems to be the editor's taste. lt's all part of the service. Good photos, aren't they? The camera shows the trust in her face. Her faith in you. Nami, is this the girl worrying you? Why do you ask? lt's just a job. Part of it involves lots of girls being around. lt's no big thing to me. That's why l give you a hand. l trust you. lt's cool. Something's out of gear. Is it down there? Stop it. We don't have time for that. Nami, if you were prepared to work with me l wouldn't mind not taking pictures of the other girls. lt's not for me... displaying myself. But they're all Nami... ... it's always Nami's image I'm taking. My only thoughts are of Nami. I'm so pleased. Don't worry about me. l believe in you. Wouldn't it be nice? - Let me take some. - l don't want to. Do we have time? Looking good, Nami. Great. Nami, you're so good-looking. Kenji. What's the matter? She's in love? Is it 203? l'll see to it. You don't mind? Get it together. What's gone wrong? Something... ... something's... come adrift. From your willie? lt feels like something wet's coming out. l've fixed it. lt had parted at the join. Now it won't happen again. Good. Relax and rest. Sleep's your top priority. Yes. - If it's for me, I'm not here - Fine. Hello. He didn't come by today. Yes. Thanks. Same one as before? Don't think it was. But these last two days... ... there've been a lot of people... ... asking 'Is Muraki there?' They don't stand on ceremony. - Is it true what they say? - What's that? Yesterday, you went off with money belonging to... ... your company's investors. lt was because they fired you. That's ridiculous. Would l do something crazy like that? lt's alright, isn't it? The nest egg l gave you to invest? Have l once let you down? Hey, let's have a little drink together. The bar's closed. Don't pick it up. Sit down and have a drink. Why not? You wouldn't let me down. Your glass? I'm this bar's good luck mascot. ln a way. But maybe not recently. There's no reason to say that. Isn't it the same old story. The magic touch has disappeared. But one more time with you... ... things might get better. How about an investment of 100,000. You'll triple it in six months. Right, that's settled. What's with you? lt's because your wife left you, you think l... Do you want me to play wifey to you? You've said it. Don't do that. Don't do that here. Where are you off to? Pee pee. Haven't you just had one? Wait... Mama... l said wait. Mama. Mama. Mama. What's that? So you're here, are you? Don't you worry. I'm the keystone of that company. Ten or twenty million yen is nothing to them. They can easily cover up for me. Oh, I'm in pain. Give me your hand. You never give up, do you? - This is Muraki speaking,,, - What time do you think it is? ,,,We're not at home at the moment, Please leave your message, l didn't invest my 20 million yen for your pleasure. Even if it kills you, you have to give me back that money. Shall l burn down your house. so you can claim on the insurance? Just sell your wife to a pimp. She's already gone. Yes. What's wrong? I'm feeling sick. l'll be with you. Get a move on. Bitch. She's all ready... ... waiting for you. I'm going to. I'm going to. I'm going to because I'm dying. What's happening? l thought this place was closed up. Doctor. Please call a doctor. Miss Tsuchiya. Kenji, my dear. Help me, Kenji. Help me. Kenji, my dear, help me. Wider again. That's it. That's really nice. Pull your panties tight. Pull them tight. More. More. More. Show your crotch. Enough already. I'm getting all wet. OK. Help. Kenji. Help me. What are you doing? You horny thing. - Show me it. - Show you what? Silly. No way. What's that? Naughty boy. l bet you're always doing this with your wife? l told you I'm not married. And l don't feel like getting married either. You're that sort of person? That's the artists' sacrifice. So... What time does she get in? We've still got four hours left. Make me something tasty. My stomach's empty. I'm off home. l've no wish to meet the other one. Hey, what sort of person is your wife. A nurse...? Haven't l told you often enough, she's just some girl? Isn't there anything l can trust you not to break? Oi, Nami... Who's that? Mr Miyao? lt is, isn't it? You're being very tough. You shouldn't be drawing up charges and things. Haven't l helped you in the past? Because of what you've been saying on the phone, my wife's gone back to her hometown. No more, please. Hello. Boss... sorry... Good morning. Yes. Yes. That's correct... OK. What's this about being fired? So the charges... But most of these things could happen to just about anybody. Huh... Why...? Eh? lt's Muraki speaking, We're not at home at the moment, Please leave your message, Are you still alive, you robbing scum? You're going to be dead. How stupid! The fact that l took care of three million yen won't stop me. l just need to get it together. I'm gonna overcome this crisis, otherwise my life will be... Bad luck follows me around. This time it's manslaughter. Tsuchiya, Nami. And these are her details. lt's no fun keeping a corpse company. Yes? Kangyo Finance. Ohkawa speaking. This is... Muraki. Ah. Is the boss around? The receptionist insists that he's away on a business trip. You still there... Ohkawa? What do you think you're doing...? Contact the police straightaway. The scandal's putting a hard squeeze on us. Hey, you. My life's hit the rocks. You've got it all wrong. Wait. Please wait! Please wait! Are you all right? Please listen to what l've got to say. No! l understand. I'm not going to do you harm. Get away. Don't come any closer. Is that how you provide help? There are good hospitals around. Why didn't you try them? Why? Why are you like this? What if l were to die? You really hate me that much? Don't mess with me. I'm not gonna let it finish like this. Do you know how much profit l made for the company? The customers thought highly of me. l lived a life of stress on their behalf. Nothing else... that's how it was. Don't take me for a fool. Who am l...? What do you think l am? This is me. This is me. This is me. I'm not gonna let it finish like this. Shit! l can't get it up. l can't. l can't! Shit. l can't. l can't. Maybe... l didn't want to sleep alone l just wanted to be next to you. Even somebody who was unconscious. Maybe. But that's not correct. Maybe... ... lt's wrong... l wanted to have sex... l thought... if l could have sex... ... it might end my run of bad luck. I'm a selfish person. I'm so sorry. Can you forgive me? Don't touch. l'll take you on. l'll publish everything you did. It'll tear your life into little pieces. You think of me as a thing. What sort of things do you think people are? Men don't feel for living creatures. That's why l won't forgive you. Things are hard for me. The electricity's still on. Maybe this is a biker's club. Maybe this is where they put on the discos. Good evening... this is room service. l brought you your dinner. What do you say? l remembered l'd bought this. You haven't eaten a thing since morning. Eat something. l found this. You can find a lot things here around here. There's enough of civilization here. We could set up home... Until they discover us. Whatever you say, there's the blessing of not having a phone. lt's certainly raining. lt's been non-stop since our meeting this morning. lt will never stop. My wife vanished. People have hounded me. Haven't they just? I'm a stockbroker... l sell stocks. l was trading 100 or 200 million yen everyday, l lost all perspective about money... When l realized, l embezzled customers' money and put it in my own account. Before l realized it l'd accounted a big debt. l got fired for doing this. The customers threw stones at me... ... they chased me and l ran awaY... l felt as if every single person in the world was chasing after me. l was looking back in fear all the time. Then l realized you were in front of me and... bang. Sorry, it doesn't answer why l did... ... what l did to you in the car... When l found out that you were alive, my head was spinning... l had one thought... ... that for the first time in my life... Look here. lt's a cassette player. Is it going to work? No, it's not. The battery's gone moldy. Aren't you eating? Don't you like the smell? What's up? Have you developed an appetite? Once you fill up, you may feel like having a chat. l need a pee. You still haven't forgiven me? l see you haven't. After what l've done... ... it's too much to ask. Hey, although you were unconscious for a long time... ... you really, really didn't see a thing. l can take a rest from work here. l haven't slept for 6 years. ln the end l fell into a deep sleep. l may be wrong-headed, but I'm not a bad man. lf you would forgive me... When we're back in Tokyo... ... l could do something, not much, but if l could... - I'm not going back. - What? There's nowhere for me to go back to. l've been dragged through the gutter. l don't feel right. lf l could get into a warm bath... ... that's all l'd want. What do you say? That's great... should we go? Would a motel somewhere do? l'd wait outside. When you look like that, you're beautiful. ln the meantime l'll buy you clothes. OK? Don't think l've forgiven you yet. There aren't many around here... ... but this might suit us. l bought you panty hose. Thanks. The old man at the store gave me a strange look. They don't normally find someone like me buying women's underwear. Funny old man. Once l've paid for this, l have left... I'm going to have to use my cards. Excuse me. What's wrong? l'd like to wash my hair, too. - Will you? - There. We may as well. Well, that's the way things are. Hey, why don't you tell me about yourself. l don't know your name. Or why early that morning you were walking along with an apron in your pocket. Are you going to let me in on it? You're a young wife. You're off to buy the morning miso and tofu. Sorry, just joking. We didn't get married. I'm a nurse. l see. My work... ... finished early. l was tired, on the way home. You're telling lies. Your old man had brought back a woman. Not having slept, l felt dizzy. No details remain... ... l've forgotten everything. Sorry... that's enough... sorry. My patients... wanted to rape me. And... when l got home. The man l'd trusted the most... ... l was wrong... l was hit by a car... ... and then assaulted. l was assaulted not just once or twice, but three times in one day. Sorry. Do you mind if l come inside you? l don't want to go back to Tokyo. Let's just go from place to place. Us two going together. Well... that's just great. You up? Thanks a lot. Does it suit me? Has something happened? Does it look nice? Yeah. l meant to get up before 6. To get some cash out... on my credit card. I'm sorry. You bought this to give me a present. l've hardly... Why not go home? Someone who's used to playing with fortunes... can't let this get him down. You can't give up. Let me look after this. Wow, l feel good. Hey. Hey. Mmmm? An air conditioned place, en suite, where you can do what you want... where could you find a hotel like that? What? Is that right? - Let's go. - Let's go. You dope. How about that? We're out of gas. I'm sorry... l didn't think. Should we go home? Get a taxi and use a cheque? There, there. We've still got a gas can. Wasn't there a gas station? Yeah, I'm sure there was. l'll try using my legs. Wait here. l don't mind... going home. What did you say? We won't be able to get cash tomorrow. Without a car... I'm going. l'll come with you. Please, wait right here. - Hey. - Mmm? Nothing. What's wrong with that Merc? lf you get a gang of bikers coming around... You'll come down from the sky and save me. Just leave it to me. Down from the sky or across the ocean in one jump. Be quick. No good, eh? You've been very sympathetic. Whereabouts is it? A way back there. Cheer up, l'll take you back down. You sure? You're a great help. l'll get the car. Whereabouts are we heading? Let's see... Turn right into the road, and then... - Come on. Come on. Stop. - Thanks. Oi, oi, hang on a minute. Get something and wipe this mark off. What was that? l told you to wipe it. Didn't you just mark it? You think l marked it? l said you marked it, didn't l? Sorry. l was in a rush. What's going on? What did you do? Eh? Get in... or stay by yourself! Nami. Nami. lf l go back. l'll separate myself from him. l'll look for an apartment. Finally, it'll be work, work, work. l'll give it my best shot. He never came back, did he? So, that's the end of that. lt works. I'm on my own again... Well, will it be alright?
