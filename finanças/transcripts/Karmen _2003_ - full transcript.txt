PYGMALION PRODUCTION presents Let's start, we haven't got much time. Episode one. Tobacco factory. I'll catch up with you. Give it to the jailbirds, they'll have it fixed in a jiffy. Too much trouble. Come out! Move! Come on, move it! Look, he's so domesticated. Honey! I've got a seam ripped in there, the wind blows in. Will you fix it? Why are you standing, rats? Move on! Will you fix it? Just a minute late, and you get a day in a solitary! Goodbye, my love! Yes... her hair smelled of tobacco for a long time after. That smell got into your skin for good. I was transferred there for a promotion. I had already bought sergeant's shoulder-straps. I tried them on before a mirror. I was a good cop, doctor. A conscientious, sober cop. I was just the right cog in that whole machine. This is for you. I don't smoke. Right dress! Attention! Left turn! CARMEN - Who's that, with a flower? - Carmen! She's a helluva bitch! Carmen? But she's got light hair. They say she tells you your fortune just to the letter. Ask her when you gonna get sergeant's stripes. You got a girl, Seryoga? You don't, really? Then make your choice. Take her off the conveyor and into the recreation room, and go ahead. But there're rules. If you start off with one, you have to stick to her until she's out. Otherwise they'd be at each other's throats... Cut it out. No, I'm serious. Only keep away from that one. She belongs to Vitka. Did you see the one who just walked? That is my rat. Oh, what a rat! She's already done time for double murder. And that one is new. A model! Cover girl. Hey, come here! I'm telling you. No, don't. You like her? I said no. It costs nothing just to look. But don't make yourself vulnerable. You give them a chance, and they'll eat your brain out, those rats. I bet they already gave you a nickname. Something like 'seamstress'. Show them their place right away. You're the boss, they're the shit. You order them and they'll polish your boots with their skirts. But to be honest, this is no service, but a vacation tour. And you've got a free ticket to it. There're exercisers and a sauna over there. And nothing ever happens. They have already done their time. And none of them wants to be locked up again for some minor offence. They only filch cigarettes. When they go out, we search them. They shove them in all kind of places. I felt neither sympathy, nor malice towards the criminals. I never tried to understand why we happened to be on the opposite sides. Each chooses his own life. Dear Hussars, please welcome Comrade Seryoga. Oh, beer! Listen, I'm gonna tell you a funny story. A colonel-general calls a major- general and says... I couldn't get her out of my head, she stuck in like a pain in the neck. I wanted to find her among those faceless sweating women. To see her, get my mind at rest and forget myself. And I saw her. ...We need to set the sofa right. Oh, holy mother! Lie down! I said, lie down! Get down, rats! Down! Call an ambulance, quick! Who did it? You've gone too far, witch. You gonna get five years. Really? My cards tell me differently. No need for fortune-telling. You gonna rot in the can, I promise. - Take her to the station. - Shall I call a car? Too much honor for one rat. Take Kalyuzhny with you. Yes, sir! So long, girls! Don't miss me, because I won't! Seryoga, I'll be right back. Make it quick, pops. One beer! And give me five pies. You're from an orphanage too, aren't you, honey? We all look the same to them, we're not like them. No home, no job, they just threw me out, no one needed me. I couldn't even take my skirt off without holes in my hose showing. All I was good for, getting banged by sailors for some food. I just took one jacket. It was in the fall, raining. They gave me two years. They think we're trash, not humans. You know what that bitch wanted? She sleeps with your lieutenant, she can do whatever she wants, scum. Either I do as she wants, or I'm back in the can. But I can't go there, I won't go back. You get me? I won't survive there. I don't know what happened to me. Something's gotjammed in my head. Like with a man who throws himself under the wheels, though he sees the car in front of him. I realized that I'll bring her to the station and never see her again. I'm gonna push you, not hard, and you fall. That weakling'll never catch me. If they catch you, it'll be the end of you. I know a through alley on that street. - No, I can't. - Then shoot me, that'll be better. I said, no! Thanks, honey. I'll find you, I pay my debts. Thanks. Shit! I cursed myself, doctor, for that moment of weakness. Everything I had worked so hard for, had been so easily crossed out. Kalyuzhny wrote in his report that you two whispered something all along. Before whispering, you should've looked at her rap sheet. You could study Criminal Code by it! Fraud, robbery, blackmail. Was on the wanted list for 3 years. I don't know how she managed to make the judges so sympathetic that they'd given her only 3 years for the theft of a jacket. A mink jacket, though. So you have to take off those stripes, too, Nikitin. Go about without them. Perhaps that'll make you wiser. After giving up service, I made rounds of the city, hoping that I'll meet her and drag to the police by her hair. Once again I was a model cop. But mostly, I wanted to atone for my sins. Hi, honey. You're a private now? I'm so sorry, I didn't mean it. I owe you one, I know. When will you be relieved? Well, I won't be free sooner, anyway. Remember: 16 Donskaya Street. You're so strong, aren't you? I got hypnotized once again. I couldn't wait till I see her, though I was sure she'd doublecross me again. I would have taken apart anyone who came near her. Hey, don't forget: 16 Donskaya Street. Commander, have you seen a girl here? A dark one, in a leather skirt. - No, I haven't. - Shit! What are you standing here for, then? Bitch! I'll kill her when I find her! Hi. - Hi. - I mean, how do you do... She hasn't locked the door again, a fine how-do-you-do for you. It's night already, but they keep coming. What do you want? Does Carmen live here? No Carmens here. - Wait. Is that 16 Donskaya Street? - Yes, it is. You got a warrant? - I say, you got a warrant? - You've got me wrong. No warrant, then go away. Dorothea, that's my honey. Don't you see? Honey? I thought he was a cop. Come on in. Change. I can't see that goddamn uniform anymore. So you say, holes in your hose, took a jacket to hide from the rain... I couldn't help myself, it was such a nice jacket... I tried it on and couldn't take it off. Do you ever tell the truth? Did I lie to you today? How did you get away? There was... Are we going to drink, or you gonna interrogate me all night? Thanks, honey. Stop playing your tricks on me. You're pissed off, aren't you? I'm sorry, honey. I didn't hit you too hard then, did I? I didn't mean to, honey. It's all right. Is it all right? You checked it? Where're you going? It's late. To do my work. Why? There's such a word - duty. I know. One has to pay one's debts. But I don't understand to whom and what you owe. All people owe only to themselves. They're supposed to be happy, but they're not for some reason. Are you still here? Beat it to your barracks, Mister Private! Give me your watch. That's it! No more time. Are you angry? Come here. Don't. I've paid you off, honey. I don't owe you anything anymore. - What happened? - Nothing. Go away! - When shall I see you? - Never, I hope. Why not? A dog and a wolf can't live together. I'll get you back to a tied house, only the other side of the bars. The cards told me so. Do you believe in that bullshit? Get out. I walked thinking about what had happened to me. I let go the criminal who all but killed someone in my presence. Then I shared a bed with her when my comrades were searching for her all over. Doctor, I realized I was going nuts. It's interesting. Why do you keep calling me 'doctor'? My occupation is altogether different. - You look like a doctor. - All right. A doctor's sitting next to a hopeless case, and writing something. Thinking about yesterday's soccer game and being sure that he himself will never lie on that stinking bed, yelling and squirming in pain. I don't think I'll ever be in your place. No one is safe, doctor. It's like an avalanche. A rock falling from the sky doesn't choose whose head to hit. Go on. Hey, come here. Wait! Shit... Damn, where are you? Wait! Freeze! Freeze, I said! You feel like running, bastard? It's you again, honey. Let go. I got my jeans torn because of you. With you, I'll have nothing to wear. What are you doing here? Why haven't you come back? I was waiting for you like an idiot. I can't come to you myself, you know. I don't know what came over me then. I cried all day after you left. Enough! What are you doing here? I need to pick up something. Will you go with me? You'd better run home. You know that the port's been cordoned off? - Have they found the shipment? - No. They'll arrest it at the exit. I'll have to pay for that shipment all my life. You understand? No. And I don't want to understand. You'll just have to look the other way, while we make it there and back. Then we'll go to my place. Well, as you wish. It won't take me six seconds to get that moron, your chief, help me. He loves broads, and bread too. He will enjoy himself at my place. Well, see you. - Wait. - You gonna apprehend me? Come on, you'll get your stripes back. Promise me that'll be the last time. Forget it, I don't need anything from you. You can drive in only here. Elsewhere, there're posts all over. Here. - Nikitin, how is it with you? - All is quiet so far. - Honey, how you doing? - All is quiet. Come tomorrow at 3. - When? - At 3. You've got half an hour. That's how long I was pleading with you last night. Come on, the timer is on. I was afraid you'll never come back. Don't ever make me beg again, please. I lived with her for a week. My goodness, how happy she was when I came back in the evening. I slept no more than two hours, then went to my job. My boss tried to smell my breath, seeing me sway from side to side. I walked like a somnambulist. I fell asleep in the car, at the station, orjust leaning against a wall in some entrance hall. Now I remember it all as one happy dream. Then she disappeared. Dorothea said she had left. But I continued to come each day anyway. There she is. Come here. Where are you? Close the door. Now I'll show Dorothea to you. Hi... I didn't expect to see you today. I'll explain everything later. What is there to explain? I'm not blind, I can see for myself. - We'll talk tomorrow. - Tomorrow? Shall I sign in for my turn? Calm down, Commander. Let's sit down and talk quietly. You'll be the last one I'll talk to. Who do you think you are? - Aren't my threads too tight for him? - Stop it! He's tough, isn't he? - Are you nuts? - And what do you have here... What's going on? Come on, Commander, calm down. - Get out. - What's the matter, man? - What are you doing? - Stop it! No! - Stop it! - What are you doing? Leave him alone! Enough, I said! Don't do it! Oh, God... Oh, my God... Oh, God! God... Shut up! Idiot! I've wheedled him for a month. That's it, your service is over. I told you I'd get you to prison. Why didn't you believe me? Why don't you say something? Are you a man or what? Say something! Honey! It's all right, wait a minute... Where are we? Oh, my beauty... Blessed be the hour... Are you here for business or pleasure? We came to see you, Nikolai. The car should be registered to his name. And we'll need new passports. This is Sergey. I see, I see. She amazed me, doctor. She could do without sleep for three days in a row, and just laughed at the others who felt exhausted. There was nothing she wasn't competent in, from the navigation regulations to Paris fashions. She spoke to Tatars in Tatar, to Gypsies in Gypsy, to Georgians in Georgian. It seemed she knew everybody. And everybody knew and loved her. Doctor, that made my life unbearable. Behind each of her acquaintances I visualized a former relationship. In each phrase I saw a hidden meaning. I could have been happy with her only on a desert island. One grand of greenbacks. All right, give me a half. - Then it's a deal. - How can I say no to you? Why don't you stay here with me? What are you talking about? She brought me together with two weird characters and left. I spent two weeks with them, waiting for her to return. But I guess there was nothing to wait for any more. Ace. King. And Carmen into the bargain. Oh, Wener, watch out. I'm lucky with cards. I'm lucky in love. And you're never in luck. You even were born a Tatar. Oh, devil! You cheated again, didn't you? Yes, yes. Here, look. Give it here. Money! May you choke with it! Oh, shit! Bad luck again! What do I do... Holy shit! I think I'll be in luck again today. - Stop that. - Everything will be all right. We'll just have a drink and relax. Miss? Miss! I wanted to make your acquaintance. Sorry it was not the right time. Wener, look what a girl we've got, a beautiful, smart girl. Where are you going, darling? Gotcha! Idiots. Leave her alone. Will you rescue me, my knight? A band of dimwits. Goldfinch, I told you not to stick your neck out. And you're looming like a baboon, your red ass seen from a mile. Wener has his pants too tight, but what's the matter with you? Feeling horny? We'll get dough, you'll pick up whores. Let's go! Give me the vest, please. I can't swim! Give me the vest! Don't be scared, we won't have to swim. They'll take care of it, so that you don't suffer. Please, give me the vest. Give it to me! Come on! - I'm going to die right now. - Here. Here, before you shit in your pants. Thanks. You, fucking pirate! Hey, guys! Sailor! Sailor! Come on, guys, let's work, let's hook in. Move it! Work, drag it. Move it! Come on, come on, come on... Otar never said there'd be a broad. You want a dozen of them, for the whole crew? That would be nice. Load it! Run, run, run, suckers... Hey, sailors, don't drown my ship. - One, two, three, four... - Come on, come on... Five, six... come on, come on... What are you doing? What are you doing, you kooks? You'll get your load and yourselves drowned. Come on. No, me, hold me! - Where have you found that crew? - It's none of your business. Goldfinch, we're casting off! Hey, boss! Tell Otar, tomorrow at 8 at the base, and he better not be late with the money! Don't you offend us, Commander! Otar is a man of his word! Who's Otar? I have no idea. I hope we'll never meet him. Speaking of the devil, that must be him. Cover the load. Don't look that way. Hey, take us in! Hurry, hurry, hurry up. Are you seasick or what? - Don't you see I'm working? - Go to hell! Are you crazy? Wener, quick, help me. - Take the sacks and carry them. - Quick, we're leaving, dimwits. Move it. Thank you, Danila Karlovich. You'd better keep the boat hidden for a while. Just in case. Bye. Honey, why is it like this with us? Not like with the other people... First you dance with a girl, the you tell her fairy tales... Come on, don't sleep. We have only 150 miles to go. Want some? All right. La dolce vita, huh? You'll have a taste of the bitter one, too. I don't know whether I loved her, doctor. I guess it was something different. Something more powerful and excruciating. One can love even at a distance, with an unrequited love. I wanted to possess that woman. To possess her every second, to possess every cell of her body, her past and her future. Can I help you? I'll tell you when. Not here any more. - What? - Thatjacket. That bitch over there had made such a racket then. And that bastard behind her called the cops. Are you out of your mind? Do you like it on me? Hold it. Please, miss? Come here, honey, and look. - What are you so happy about? - Nothing. - Didn't you forget anything? - No. No? What about this? - Why? We could buy it. - It's a matter of principle. Come on, what is it? Carmen has gotten Squint out of prison! You don't say! What a broad! You hear, Seryoga? And who's that? Her husband. Stop babbling. - Is she married? - You didn't know? They were accused together. He took the blame on himself in the court. It made no difference for him, he could turn everybody in and drag them to prison with him. But that way Carmen waltzed away from it, and he got 15 years. Wener, are you dumb or what? Cut it out. Shut up. To make it short, they changed the doctor there. And Carmen had wheedled the new one right away. She arranged that Squint be put in a hospital, and to bugger off from there was no problem. - Are you a complete asshole? - Go to hell... He's got some problems with his eyes? No, he's squinted up here. - Yes? Squint! - Howdy, Goldfinch! You feigned it great! You're really something! Aren't you amazing! Squint! Still growing? You'd better pump your ears into meat. Squint is back! Long time no see! Beard! - What a mess you've got here. - I'll clean it right away. I've heard of you. Way to go. Goldfinch, put on volume on TV. Slut! Bitch! Whore! Go to hell! You stink of all of them! Are you finished? Can you listen to me now? I had to pull him out of there at any price. I couldn't have been happy with you like this at his expense. I can't do it any other way, honey. One has to pay one's debts. - Do you love him? - No. I loved him very much once, I was crazy about him. Not now. Let's leave right away. Stop torturing me, honey, please, I beg you. I don't know what's going to happen to us. I don't understand anything. But I beg you, don't leave. I don't want to lose you. I dreamed last night... Can you read dreams? They're coming. When you see blood, it means money, a dead man means luck. I'd seen that dream as a child. All right, let's get rolling. I stand on the beach and there's an alarming silence all around. Then I see a dark belt on the horizon which moves closer and closer. I realize that it's a tsunami. To dream that on the first day of your freedom. What could it mean? I don't know. Of course. I guess cops never dream. Not allowed by the regulations. I've got an idea. First light supper. Then a night stroll by the sea. I know one terrific harbor with gorgeous cypresses. So, it's agreed: at 9 by the rotunda. Sure. You're such a fun. After a night with Carmen, one can dream even worse stuff. Cut it out. We're one family. Don't worry, I'm not the jealous type. To be jealous of Carmen is too costly. Why are you so nervous? Step on it, don't lose them. I can read to you from Rimbaud. Or maybe you prefer Russian poetry, Yesenin, Lermontov? With such surroundings... What do you think? You don't understand jokes. And I'm a simple, easygoing guy. I've noticed it. The sea, the sun... I'll give you my card. Jerk! Where are you going? Open the door. As they say, good evening, ladies and gentlemen! Welcome to the beaches of Crimea. Give me your card. Remove the ring. Get down! Just look at that landscape! Nice and easy you get rid of the ballast. Quiet. - Turn your bag inside out. - No use, I'm still empty. Keep it. You should've hidden it better, dear. Take off your earrings. Get up. Come on, come on! - Tatar, it's you? Over. - Yeah, it's me. Say something in Tatar. - What are you doing there? - Me? Nothing... I've got a pregnant wife. What the hell are you doing, dear? 911? That's it. Let's split. - You forgot your Tatar, didn't you? - How can we forget you? Squint, that's a lot of bread! I'll go back to my aul today. Faster! Faster! The cops! You hear, Seryoga? Take a turn! Slow down! - Slow down, we won't make it. - Oh, God, I'm innocent... Slow down, I said! Shut up, Goldfinch! Back up. Slow down, we're out. Squint! Squint! Squint, my leg! Come on, come on, get up, we must run. What? What's the matter with you? Look that way. Fuck you, Squint! What are you doing, bastard? With him, we would've never got away. If anything, you shoot me. Or I'll shoot you. We hid in the mountains for 3 days. The cops got very serious about us. At daytime a copter circled over, so we walked at night. We slept in caves, embracing each other, not to get cold. Squint, me, and our woman between us. We had a bag full of money, but we starved. That's what money is worth, doctor. Then she left for the city. From there she let me know that she planned a major operation. She needed someone to help her. Too many people knew Squint there. And Wener was no good for a delicate job. Drink orange juice! The best fruitjuice in the world! I had nothing against it. I came there, got a by-the-day job, and waited. Hey, orange! Orange! Orange! Yes, yes, you! Come up here! Smile, honey. This guy doesn't know a word of Russian. - Say 'nyet'. - Russian... nyet... - It's very important. - You've got yourself a fine pad. I'm happy for you. Honey, the guy's got so much money you'll never count the zeroes. Has plants in Crimea and all over the world. He's under my thumb. - You sleep with him? - Oh, God... I'm in love with you. Isn't it enough? Let's not start it all over again. What a fool. - Vodka. - Hey, I don't want any vodka... All right, just a little bit. I told him that, according to our tradition, he has to offer you vodka. Look how much he's pouring. I need only up to two fingers. Drink it, don't disgrace the nation. That's it, honey, the show is over. We have to go to a restaurant. We can't take you along, you won't fit into the car. Tomorrow, when he leaves, take off your sack and come here. Oh, Mister Orange! Come on in, please. I missed you so much, honey. Come on, I'll show you how the rich and famous live. This is the bedroom. - Ever been to such palaces? - I can do without a tour. I want you to remember the rooms' plan. This is the living room, you've already been here. - Want some tequila? - No. Let's get to business. Sorry, honey, it was not I who put that stupid costume on you. I just asked you to find a job on this street. Though it's even to the better. Thousands remembered your costume, and none of them your face. Besides, it suits you so much. You could have been a great actor. All right, let's forget it. Only business. Come on. Take off yourjacket, it's warm in here. Come on. These windows look onto an alley. And this is, look... Look. One camera looks onto the street, the other one on the entrance. Sorry I've turned it off, you won't be immortalized for posterity. This is a housemaid's room. The back door is over there. There must be a key somewhere. He probably thinks I'm a Russian doll with a wooden head. But I moved the mirror and found out the code. I got into his computer, but there's all kind of protection there. Next week he is to get 200,000-250,000 dollars in cash. When I know for sure, I'll let you know. Go on being an orange for a while. Look around, maybe I can't see everything from here. Perhaps there's some external surveillance, the cops or bandits. Damn, where's that key? Tell Squint we won't need the car. He gave me a Mazda, though he could afford a Honda. Honey, what about our business? I'm screwed up. Twenty. Well, some get lucky at cards, others in love. Playing? I'll pass. You're being wise, Wener, or your little Tatars will go pantless. Playing. You take. Twenty. Don't be so sad, Carmen'll cheer you up. You're not the first nor the last. Shall we play again? All right. More. More. Now you. Six. Twelve. Eighteen. Blackjack. Looks familiar? Incredible! That's it. That's it, easy, easy. Easy. What is she going to say? Don't get fidgety. It had to happen anyway. She's only mine, I love her. You think nobody knows it? You think everybody's blind? Oh, how I hate that love of yours, that idiotic feeling! There's no love, you're just sick in your head. You, she, him! Wener, you're a good man. You may take your share and leave. But you may also stay. She'll come and we'll get easy money. When she arrived, I simply told her that Squint was no more. That now she was my wife and we were going to be together forever. Do you pity him? Do you pity him?! I don't pity him, I pity you. You're so stupid. You've already killed two men. The third one will kill you. I don't remember the first digit. I couldn't see it well. Got it! No running, no shooting. Just come and take. Awesome! Shit! The radio alarm system! I should've known better. Sons of a bitch! Bastards! Parasites! This way! The back door! Hurry! Hurry! Just a minute... Wait... Where is it? Seryoga! Where's the exit? I don't understand. Seryoga, what is it? We blew it again... No... Sons of a bitch! Seryoga, help me! We'll break it! Come on... Not this way! - What? - The cops. - Well? - Let's go! Lay off. Lay off. Don't be in the way. Hold on, honey, please. Hold on just a bit. Hold on. Hold on just a little bit. Your life may be not very happy, but it will be a long one. You must live, you must make it. Do you hear me? Breathe in, please. Try to breathe in, please. Come on, come on... Honey... honey... A whole month I floundered between life and death. For that whole month she'd never left my side. She spoon-fed me, changed the dirty sheets under me. I reeked like a dog, but she undressed and lay down beside me, to make me warm when I was shivering. Sorry, doctor, I myself hate tearful men. But when someone up there will be passing a judgement on her... this alone will outweigh all her sins. Nature blessed me with strong health, and I began to get better. Only then she left. We needed a new partner. She said, "Two are not a gang. Two are a family." The cops have gone wild. Our pictures are on every corner. That beau of mine promised a reward for me. I didn't know I was worth so much. He'd better have given me that money and we would have parted friends. Listen, something great has happened to me. I was looking for one man and got to a motorcycle race. The whole town was there. I even made one round myself, can you imagine? Oh, you don't understand anything. It's so awesome, so powerful! You didn't start yet, but it's all shaking under you. You just touch the handle-bar, and itjumps. You touch the brakes, and they grip like with clutches. And at a curve you have to hold to it with your knees, not to be thrown out. I made up to 150 on the straight line. He didn't let me make more. - Who? - Ah, just a boy about 20. I've found some people there. I'm still checking them up. Listen, let's go away from here. We've got a hell of a lot of money. We don't need anyone. We'll buy new ID's, an apartment. Yes, a kitchen-garden and a small tractor. I'll make pickles for the winter, and we'll spend long winter nights sitting like two love-birds and watching TV. In a month I'll begin to hate you, and in another one I'll run away. I have to go. You can't, your stitches will come apart. - Do I have a wife or not? - You have, but she's in a hurry. She's got a very important meeting. Sometimes... it happens, honey. - Did you see it? - You were great! The participants of the second race are invited to the start line. I didn't know where to look for her. The entire police force has been looking for her for a year, with all their detectives, snitches, and her photos in the news. And what could I do all alone? But I knew of a place, doctor, where she was supposed to show up. We kept our life-vest there, the money we put away for a rainy day. I was ready to wait for her a year, even ten years. But she showed up in a week. Hi, honey. - Where's your racer? - I have no idea. Making rounds somewhere on his bike. How come it didn't work out? He's a spoiled brat. He probably thought I'd be like a spare wheel... for him. I loved you much more, honey. And, perhaps, longer. Look, I'll forget everything. I'll never ask you about anything. Only let's go away. Let's hop in the car and go away. Why? Why not? I don't love you any more. I'll never live with you. What? What have I done wrong? I gave up everything. I got only you, nothing else. Tell me what I must do. Perhaps I can change something. It's not your fault, honey. It's my fault. I don't know why it's like that. I can't order myself to love only you and no one else. All right. Let's leave it the way it is. But let's be together. - Maybe, one day... - I'll never be with you. Never. I guess you're a very good friend, the best I've ever had. But you're going to kill everyone who touches me, even in passing. Then I better kill you. A car's waiting for me. Over there. I'll tell him to go. Honey! The driver has nothing to do with it, he just wanted to make a quick buck. I don't know any prayers, doctor. I was just begging someone up there to make her disappear. She could take my car. The key was in the ignition. She could take the money and run, even walk away. And I would have looked for her again, my life would have had some sense. But she didn't even move. Look... During the investigation you didn't say you killed her. What for? It concerns only her and me, no one else. I don't think she would have wanted your corpse manglers in rubber gloves tinker with her naked body on their table. Look, in your situation one more murder out ofjealousy in the state of temporary insanity wouldn't make any difference. Sure, I can get you to receive 20 years instead of life imprisonment... Take it easy, doctor. One can live one's life for 80 or 100 years, but one can also live it in a year, the whole life, completely. Look. I picked it up back at the factory. I often get to thinking... Why did it happen to me of all people? I'm an ordinary man. And that's what I understood. Everyone of us - you, me, someone else - has gotten one and only woman. Each has his own. You may never see her, because she lives far away. Or you may meet her as soon as you come out of here. She may be living on the nearest street, just around the corner. And then, doctor... I hope it'll never happen to you. You seem to be a good man. I honestly hope it'll never happen to you. What have you decided? I said it already. You're no stranger to me and I won't lie to you. Right. You could've done it much sooner, back at the factory. It would have been much simpler. You could even have gotten a medal. I'm begging you. Why do people think one's heart is here? It is right in the middle. You talk of love when you don't even know where she lives. Doctor, do you believe there's something up there? Where we are all bound to meet? I don't know. No one knows. And I believe in it.
