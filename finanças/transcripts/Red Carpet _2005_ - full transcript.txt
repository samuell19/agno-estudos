"RED CARPET" The pain of a longing Who's never felt that? Remembering the past Who has never Missed someone? The pain of a longing Who's never felt that? Remembering the past Who has never Missed someone? The little house The shining moon The gentle breeze Swept from the sea The pain of a longing Who's never felt that? Remembering the past Who has never Missed someone? - The pain of a longing - Hey, Neco! Ê, goat shit! Neco, com'ere, boy! Shake a leg, son! What's with all the hollerin', woman? Here I am, thinkin' about the good o' days and you scare the heck outta me. Whatcha frettin' 'bout, anyway? Whaddiya want with the boy, now? I want Neco to hunt me a frog. Benedita's boy is down with bronchitis. A frog? Forget it. Ain't no more frogs in the swamp, woman. Too darn difficult! Them frogs like nice clean water. They purdy much disappeared. When it rains, you can still hear a couple of 'em croakin' by the creek. But not like when I was a boy. Not anymore. It's all different in these parts... but the poor. Either sun or rain, for us it's just work 'n' work... believin' one day the sky's gonna open up and split the worid down... with good, hard workin' men on one side... and the low-lifes on the other, headin' straight to hell. But I don't think that's gonna happen in this worid of Our Lord. Only in the next. Ya called, ma? I'm on my way, ma. On my way. Hold on... Ê! This boy's more like a frog... jumpin' around all the time. Here. Take this to Benedita. Tell her to serve the boy plenty of this broth today. The rest tomorrow, as soon as he wakes up. Take this syrup, too. In two days, her boy will be just fine. Later on, I'll pass by to bless the boy for healin', okay? Now, hustle 'cause it's almost lunchtime. Come back soon 'cause I got somethin' important to tell you two... - What's that, pa? - I'll tell ya when you get back. Ouch! Your birthday's comin' up, son. And I got a present all lined up for you. We're all goin' to the city to watch a Mazzaropi film. You're gonna like it just like I did. When I was a boy, my pa used to take me to the movies. And I promised him I'd do the same with you when you was old enough. - A movie? Where, pa? - Tsc, tsc, tsc... Where do you think you can watch a Mazzaropi film? Where ya gonna find a movie theater? Mazzaropi's dead... - As far as I know. - Don't be so dumb, woman. The man's dead, but the movies are still around. The movie people can show 'em whenever they want. We're gonna find a place showin' Mazzaropi... in one of those towns in the Valley. I'm sure he's playin' somewhere. What about my promise to pa? It's time to do my duty. Merciful Lord! Stop inventin' stuff, crazy fool. Pa, is a movie bigger than the TV doctor Marcolino's got... ...with that dish antenna thing? - Much... much bigger, son. A big boy, knows how to read 'n' stuff, and yet he ain't never been... to the movies like I used to go ev'ry Sunday with my pa. Are you two out of your mind? I ain't settin' foot out for no movie theater. - I got too much to do. - Oh yes, you are! You're gonna enjoy it. The yam crop was good, we got some money to go sightseeing. Neco's on summer vacation, eh, Neco? Time for a little adventure, woman! And how are we goin'? What about the livestock? - We're walkin'. - Walkin'? You're outta your mind! And I'm takin' Policarpo along! Colonel and Tarzan will care for the house. Benedita for the livestock. - And period. - Go without me or I'll leave you! I'm up to here with this Mazzaropi story! And for a long time, now! Wow! The movies! Howdy, Quinzinho. Is that boy gonna grow up to be a fisher or a liar? You kiddin' me, Adâo? Ya got two top-notch fishermen here, right son? - The best of the best! - Ê! That's the way! Zulmira paid you all a visit. How's the boy? He's fine, now! His lungs are all cleared up! I heard you're headin' off to see Mazzaropi. Benedita's gettin' the donkey ready for the trip. - We're all going... - Alrighty, then. Have a nice trip. - We'll tell ya about it afterwards. - May the guardian ángel be with you. Thanks. May God be with you! So you all are gonna go on a trip? Not me, Benedita. I'm gonna leave Quinzinho. I'm gonna leave Quinzinho. I'm gonna leave this house... and move in with my aunt in the big city. - I'm tired of his crazy ideas! - Don't say such a thing, Zulmira. You all are young and you like to travel, visit your aunt and stuff... Besides, it'll be good for your legs, your blood circulation... your head, and your eyes to see different stuff, city stuff... I ain't interested in no city stuff! Now, son, if you really wanna fish, the first thing... you need to know is where the fish are. Ya don't just cast the line any ol' place. First ya gotta take a look, find a pool... a place where more fruit fell from the trees... where there's more food. That's where the fish are. Then just cast the line... ...sit tight... - And when you feel them nibblin'... ...pull fast. - Uh-huh! Pull fast, but gently, so you don't tear its head off. Ya gotta be calm 'n' gentle for ev'rything in life, son. To sow, to pull the yams out from the soil... to get food from the river... to feel the surroundings... Life's all about finding a place... where you can get what you need without gettin' all worked up. But what if there's no pool with fish, pa? Then you gotta make one for them. Ev'ry day you put a little food... some berries, corn, bread crumbs and soon... the fish'll start livin' there. I got my birds, my herbs, my livestock... Gosh, I sure like country livin', Benedita. I'm used to the silence, the hard work ev'ry day. I got no business in the big city, my Lord. But don't ya go visit your aunt there now and then? Yeah, but that's different. When I visit my aunt Marvina, I'm back here in no time. Zulmira, could ya help me with the cow? Her milk's gone watery. She's lost weight suddenly. I think it's the evil eye. They put a spell on her. There's always plenty of envy around people of value. Get me some herb of grace, lots o' coarse salt... and off to the corral! What about that other film, pa... the one where Mazzaropi was full of money and always... runnin' away from the ladies? In the end of the film, we find out it was all a dream. He wakes up just as poor as when he went to sleep. Them piles of money he could even swim in... and the lady-folk runnin' after him... had all been just a dream. Ê, Mazzaropi, huh? Ê, Mazzaropi! - What's the matter with your cow? - Evil eye! The Lord cometh, the Lord goes. What's troublin' you, cow? Belly, legs, evil eye. Oh sad yellow cow. Oh Holy Trinity. Oh sad yellow cow. Oh Holy Trinity. Oh sad yellow cow. Oh Holy Trinity. "Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women... and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners... now and at the hour of our death. Amen." I'm goin' to town today... It's a fine day to see the worid. Go, Tarzan, go... Don't look like rain to me. The sun's out, but we ain't getting no sunburn. Neco! Go fetch Benedita, Policarpo and Colonel, on the double! Time is short! Are the provisions ready, Zulmira? Fried chicken, rice, yams, farofa, a bunch of bananas... tangerines, tobacco, the guava paste, the jug of water? Stop buggin' me! The day's a risin', the swallows are singin'... I got an eye on you, 'cause you're really purdy. Stop buggin' me! Here, Colonel! Ê, Policarpo! - I brought ya'all some cake. - God bless you, Benedita. See ya soon, Benedita. Send my regards to Adâo. Watch the house for us, Colonel. Giddy up, Policarpo. Giddy up, Policarpo. Bye, Colonel. Bye, Benedita. See ya soon. I'm gonna leave this fool. You'll see! See ya all! May St. Benedict, St. Anthony... the Good Jesus of Pirapora and Our Lady of Aparecida be with you. Don't fret, now, 'cause the house is well taken care of. Just look at that. One mule drawing another. I can see where these clowns are headed. In one film, Mazzaropi says women are nothin' but trouble... since the day God made the first one from Adam's rib. Is that so, pa? Your ma is real systematic. Yup, systematic, poor soul. She just can't get away from that o' routine of hers. Not even once. FLOSS-SILK TREE FARM Whoa, Policarpo. Mrs. Maria! Hey! Mrs. Maria! Hey! Hey! Howdy, Mrs. Maria. Hi, Zulmira. Hi, Quinzinho. Come on in. Come on in. Gee, Maria, it's sure been a long time since I've seen you. It sure has. Where's Mr. Marcolino and Mrs. Rosa? 'Round here somewhere, waitin' for the hoedown folk. - Hoedown? - Yep. Mr. Marcolino loves a hoedown! - And you all? Out sightseein'? - Yep. We're goin' down to the Valley to take the boy out for some fun. - We need a place to sleep tonight. - Stay right here with us, of course. Mrs. Rosa's gonna like to see you. You came just in time for the hoedown. Mrs. Rosa's busy with the baby now. It won't stop cryin', poor thing. - But you'll be wantin' to freshen up. - What about Policarpo? Just leave the donkey there. Come inside, come in. Let's have supper. Let's go, pa. My stomach's growlin'. We thank Our Father for the food the Lord has placed before us. - Amen. - Amen. You know what happened to Mrs. Memorina's mare? - Com'on 'n' tell us, good man. - Fell down that steep slope... in front of Celidônio's farm. They had to sacrifice the poor thing. She broke a hind leg. You remember that tall guitar player, a fella from Minas, a Mr. Renato... who was always 'round here... Iookin' for a pretty bride to marry, only he had a bad temper? Well, he can't come here no more. Folks here are scared to death of him. His guitar plays by itself. - Merciful Lord! - Yep. Mr. Marcolino brought him here to play at his son's baptism. He showed up all fancy dressed in black, a silk scarf around his neck. They even drove him here in the pickup. He sang and danced all night long. We loved it, it was wonderful. Then he went to sleep in the guest room. But he left his guitar in the living room, on a chair. Ev'rything was nice and quiet and we were all sleepin'... when suddenly the guitar strings began to play by themselves. I didn't hear a thing, but the other folks say they did. Next mornin' Mr. Renato made fun of ev'rybody... saying a mouse had fallen in the guitar... n' tried to play his way out. But nobody believed a word he said because... he's the son of Evil One! We just let him talk n' talk... and now we don't want him anywhere near here. Is that so? Well, folks say Mr. Renato made a deal with... the Evil One. I don't know for sure, I never met him. But people say nobody plays the guitar like him. Not here, nor Sâo Paulo... Minas Gerais... He's real good. - He is good. - He is real, real good. - Real good. - I agree. He's good, alright. - Real good, he is. - Very good. - He is good. - Good evening. Hello, dear. Howdy, Quinzinho! Brought your guitar for some singin' tonight? - Sure! - It's a full moon out there. Good for guitar playin'... and hoedowns, too. A night for werewolves and Saci Pererê. Let's see if your guitar plays by itself, too, Mr. Quinzinho? Hush! My guitar was christened at a St. Gonçalo feast. Ya won't hear this one playin' by itself. - Gumercindo, where's Mr. Marcolino? - Over there. We all came together. Oh! Let me go and say "hello". - Hi, Mrs. Rosa. - Hi, Zulmira, nice to see you! This is Joâozinho, my baby. My breasts are full and yet he cries as if he were starving. Could that be evil eye? Pray for him, Zulmira. Pray. Could it be...? Could it be that...? I think I can help, Mrs. Rosa... but I'm gonna have to sleep here in the room with you. I'll hide behind that closet. You just take it easy... and do ev'rything ya normally do ev'ry night. Just make sure Mr. Marcolino knows... so he won't be surprised to find me here! - You know what's goin' on, Zulmira? - I have a hunch, Mrs. Rosa. A hunch. Zulmira knows what she's doin'... Tuned up my guitar To play at the hoedown Qur little Brazilian dance Qur people are ever so fond of Ai, ai! A dance that's part of our heritage With undeniable value! Isn't that right, Mr. Marcolino? Zé Pirambêra is a basket case. Soon he'll be on all fours with his... hiney pointin' to the moon. This is the dance of the redneck An important part of our culture I invite the people to enjoy Ai, ai! We tell you only the truth Don't like no lyin' 'round here! So I hear you all are lookin' for a Mazzaropi film? We're on our way. It's all arranged. Zulmira's a little disagreeable... ...but she's comin' along as well. - How do ya plan to get there? On foot with Policarpo carryin' our stuff. No, thanks. - Policarpo's going too? - He's good at long hauls. Well, every once in a while they show one of his movies on TV. Next time, I'll call ya and you can come here to watch. I promised my pa I'd take the boy to a movie theater to watch Mazzaropi. It's time to honor my word. They must be playin' his movies somewhere. - We'll find out where. - Well, that's a fact. You just need to look hard enough. Thank you, Mr. Marcolino. It was an awesome feast! Hey, Neco... Neco! - Oh, I wanna watch the cartoons. - Your pa wants you to go to bed. - Just an itsy-bitsy more, like this. - Then he's gonna come here after you. Bedtime, Neco. Bedtime. Come on. Alright! You don't let me do anything! You wretched thing! You curse! - The party's over, milk thief! - What's going on? - My God! What's goin' on here? - My God! Relax, Mr. Marcolino. Don't kill it. I'm gonna pray for it and let it go in the woods. Then it'll go after the one who cast this spell against ya'all. "St. Anton, remain always by my side, St. Anton. Thou who defeated the demon... in the form of this filthy beast... please, help me, St. Anton. During the hour of temptation, please help me, St. Anton. Amen." Come on, I'm gonna let you go in the woods... and you're gonna seek the one who cast the spell. Now, go... Gumercindo will take you to the city. You decide where to go from there. - Thanks, Mr. Marcolino. - Don't mention it. - Say "thanks", son. - Thank you. And God bless you. - Maria. - A gift from Mrs. Rosa. You shouldn't, Mrs. Rosa. Oh, how pretty! You guessed my favorite color! - What's that? - What the heck? Told ya so, Maria. Ê! It's a big ol' worid out here! And here I am, after some dumb ol' Mazzaropi film! Try to enjoy yourself, Mrs. Zulmira. Have fun. Life can't be all about work. There's gotta be some fun, things to see... I've got plenty of "worid", Gumercindo! Poor people have fun goin' to the grocer and fillin' the shoppin' bag. This is all good! The rest is just a waste of time... foolin' around like Quinzinho, who's got his head in the clouds. - That's for sure, right, Quinzinho? - Huh? - Bye, Quinzinho! - G'bye, ol' buddy. God be with you. - Have a nice trip ya all. - God be with you. Well, let's look for a movie theater in the next town... 'cause this one's never had one to begin with. - Let's go? - Let's. We're gonna wind up sleepin' under a bridge, that's for sure. Why are we stoppin' here? Looks like rain. We need to find some shelter for us to eat, right? Boy, am I cookin' his goose. Mazzaropi, dear friend, don't keep us out here in the rain. We only came to see one of your movies and then go back home. So gimme a hand 'cause I can't afford to lose my wife... nor let my boy down, can I? Gee, I think it's gonna rain, pa. - Mornin'. - Mornin'. Where can I find the movie theater, please? Nowhere in this town. The only one we had is now this store here. What good is a movie theater for a hillbilly? I have what you need. Come in. A TV just like this one. Now that's entertainment. It's even better than the movies. Let me show you. Yeah, it sure is purdy. I bet you're sayin' this 'cause you ain't seen Mazzaropi on the movies. Heck, I bet you ain't never been to a movie theater. Listen, you redneck. Why don't ya go home and tend to your potatoes? Yeah, I'm a redneck alright. And I'm proud of that. Got my little piece o' land... my yams, no potatoes! I work for myself! Ain't nobody else's employee. The movie theater is now a supermarket. You'll only find one still working... in the next town, straight ahead. Shucks! Our shoes are gonna wear out before we find us a movie theater. Take it easy. Why don't ya rest a while and play some for us? Alberico, bring some of that cachaça from Minas, the one in the barrel... we got us a guitar player here. Ma, since we're already here, let's stay. My birthday's comin' up, so let's follow pa. - You still mad at me? - Don't give me no sweet talk. Your days are numbered. Zuri... In these modest words My belle, my love To you I wish to speak About my pain and sufferin' I'm like a thrush Who sings in sorrow Comin' from where he's perched With this guitar I sing from the heart - Did ya have other girlfriends, pa? - Nope. Never liked any other woman. Only your ma. The others seem too fat for me. - How come? - Cause they're chubby, kinda flabby. She's the one I like. - Mornin'. - Mornin'. Where ya headed? We're headin' to the next city over there. What about you? I'm headin' there, too. If ya like, get onboard. I'll take ya there. - We'd like that, huh? Come on, Neco. - Let's go. I'm gonna meet with my wife and kids... who are at a campsite near there. My comrades found this huge farm and... it's all empty land. We're lookin' for a piece o' land to set a house... ...make a livin' 'n' plant in peace. - That so? And who owns all this land? A farmer who people say has even more land than the Andrades. He doesn't even live 'round here. Folks from the landless movement... said we could stay, for government would give us the land over time. - More land than the Andrade, huh? - That's right. We'd go with ya, but thank God I already got a little piece o' land. Right, Zuri? I inherited it from my late grandpa Tonico. The government's givin' land? For us, they won't even give a bag o' manure. - I bet it has to do with them 'lections. - They ain't exactly givin' no land. They call it a "settlement", but for us it's the same thing. A handful o' folks with way too much land and loads with no land at all. So what's new? It's been like this since the beginnin' of times. - What's your name, friend? - It's Manoel Pinto. But call me Mané, the Cart Driver. That's how they call me 'round here. Mané? That's my son's name, right son? Mine is Joaquim Silva, Quinzinho. Where do ya live? I don't have a home. I used to work on a farm nearby, a real big farm. I was born n' raised there. But one day they brought in the machines and we all lost our jobs. Now whenever they need workers, they go into town... and get themselves some hired hands. So I do odd jobs, this 'n' that. I take goods to the markets... then go 'round lookin' for work. If ya ain't got your piece of land by now, ya ain't gonna get it anymore. If we move to the city, we go hungry and wind up livin' under the bridge. - No jobs for people like us. - Hey, Zuri. Give the fella a fruit, a mango or somethin'. Much obliged. Look, whenever you go near Formoso... ask around for Quinzinho's place. I'm Mr. Baltazar's son. - You're welcome anytime. - Gotta keep on fightin', Quinzinho! - Giddy up! - That's it. Keep on fightin'. What a redneck! SELF-SERVICE RESTAURANT "Eat well, pay little". Com'on, pa, let's go in. My stomach's growlin'. Let's see what kinda grub they got. We'll look for a movie theater later. We got time. Merciful Lord! Get ready to empty your pockets. Would you like two plates for that? No, thanks. It's all goin' to the same place, anyways. - That's R$ 25. - My golly! That's the price of ten bushels o' yams. Hear that, Zuri? Serves ya right for bein' a glutton. Next. That's why the city folk is always sick: not enough food and too much fancy livin'. Dimwits. Spendin' all their money on clothes. Good afternoon. Please, where could I find a movie theater? Nowhere in this town. Last one was made into an evangelical church. Churches are more profitable than movies. Movie theaters went bankrupt. People even pay to get in churches. I don't like this thing about payin' now to receive in the afterlife. I don't like people owing me, nor to owe to anybody, right Zuri? If ya gotta pay, then pay in this ol' life. Stop yappin'. Would ya know where I could find a movie theater... to watch a Mazzaropi film? Ya might find a movie theater in one of them towns down the road... but I don't know about Mazzaropi films. What's goin' on, my God? Them crazy mosquitoes got chamber pots on their heads! Gee! MAZZAROPI SHOP Excuse me, sir. Is this store yours? - Yes. How can I help you? - Are you related to Mazzaropi? No. This was my father's store and he was a big Mazzaropi fan. Me, too. Would ya happen to know where we can watch a Mazzaropi movie? I know of a movie theater, but I don't think they're showing Mazzaropi. I never watched one. Never watched one? What do they show, then? They show movies everybody wants to watch. Who likes Mazzaropi, anyway? Heck, I do. So does my son, my wife 'n' a lot o' people I know. So where's this movie theater? The movie theater? It's at the square. Go straight ahead, and you'll get there in no time. Thanks a bunch. Come, Policarpo. There goes the biggest redneck I've ever seen in these parts. Hey, mister! I know some people who might know something about Mazzaropi movies. People who like it. They play the guitar. They meet around 8 PM to play guitar over at Ico's Bar... ...at the end of this street. - Thanks again. VOGUE MOVIES THEATER - Evenin'. - Evenin'. Are ya playin' any Mazzaropi movies? Mazzaropi? No, we only play new movies. They show oldies at the church theater on Sunday afternoons. But not this month. The projector's busted. Let me take a look inside, pa, to see what a movie theater looks like. Can't do that. You got to have a ticket first. But we'll be opening soon. Now where am I gonna find one o' his movies, my St. Benedict? - Just let me take a peek inside, pa. - Hush, Neco! The sessión's starting soon. If you want to watch, just buy a ticket. But let me tell you beforehand: it's not a Mazzaropi movie. Please, mister, let me take a peek inside. All right. I'll let you in... but just for the boy to take a look, okay? A quick peek. - Come. - Thank you. We won't take long. - Alright. Let's go? - Did ya like the movie theater, son? Real nice. But it's chilly inside, like wintertime. Well, let's go to that Ico's Bar. We'll find a place to sleep along the way. Let's go. I'm goin' to that Ico's place to see if I can find us a Mazzaropi movie. Wait for me here. We'll find us a place to sleep when I get back. Don't take too long, ok? I once beat a satanic guitar player It was a diabolical challenge! To mediate this titanic encounter An exorcist and a Catholic father It seemed like Germanic warfare And the outcome was truly chaotic He lost control of his own organics Stained his guitar and became a neurotic Whoa! Hey, you. What's your name, guitar player? Who, me? Yeah, you with that beat up ol' hat that looks more like a bird's nest. Quinzinho. Well, join us, Quinzinho. Gonna sing us somethin'? Oh gosh. No. You guys play real good. I can't play up to you guys. - Oh, com'on. Just one. - Oh, no, no. I wouldn't dare. We're here to have fun. You even brought your guitar. Oh, this? It's nothin'. You guys play. You're good. Yep, Blackie. It's gonna be a long night. You keep us company 'n' watch over us while we sleep. Not a star in the sky, a night for lost souls. I'm gettin' me some sleep. Sleep, too, silly. The sun is settin' on the range Soon it'll be nightfall A man stops his plowin' Picks up his ax n' sickle And heads back home to rest Ico! Well, if it ain't Mr. Renato, the worid's greatest guitar player. Hi. Hi! Where I come from, ev'rybody talks about you, you know? - You a guitar player, too? - Hardly at all. - Where ya from? - Formoso. Oh, you're from the so-called dead towns along the Paraíba Valley. That's where the troopers rode the gold shipments... from Minas Gerais to the port of Parati. Those towns were rich during the coffee-baron days. They used to live in palaces bigger than the ones in France. But when coffee collapsed... they all went out of business and the towns were forgotten. Died out. Can't really say the town's dead. Lots of folks alive n' kicking there. Though there ain't no movie theaters for us to watch Mazzaropi. Yeah, you gotta be very "alive" to get your kick 'round here. Once this woman from Sâo Luiz do Paraitinga fell in love with me. - Is that so, Mr. Renato? - A major problem. I suspected she was tryin' to fence me in. Folks told her that if she made this cake I'd fall in love with her... if she could get me to eat it. That brunette sure was hot. And married, too, they told me. Tramp. One day she spotted me as I was ridin' my horse nearby her place. So she cast her spell: "My husband ain't home. Tie your horse and come on in for a coffee". I did just that. She came up with a mug of coffee and a nice fresh cake. She must've been keepin' an eye on me 'cause she knew I'd be around. The moment I saw that cake, I excused myself... tellin' her I had had a bite to eat a little while earlier. She insisted, but I got off the hook by sayin' that... I'd take it home and eat it later. She was real pleased. So when I got home, I gave it to my dog. The dog ate it all up. - My dog's livin' with her now. - The dog fell in love with her. Mr. Renato escaped from double trouble! Ya gotta be smart, buddy, real smart. Listen, I'm gonna ask you a question you must answer at once. Wanna play the guitar just like me? Me, Mr. Renato? I sure would! Would ya do anythin' to play the guitar just like me? - Anythin', Mr. Renato. - Even a deal with the Dark One? I dunno. What's the deal? Go to the crossroads at midnight... tonight, and take your guitar. You'll be a great guitar player and the ladies will be chasin' you. You'll make a fortune, do whatever you want, buy a big farm... Buy a movie theater... and go straight to hell! God forbid! Could hell be worse than all the evil and sufferin' we see in this worid? What difference is there? And do you have anything to do with that, Mr. Renato? Did you and the... make a deal? I know about these things. I can take you to the crossroads, if you like... Oh well, I'm protected. Can the Evil One do me harm when I got all these saints protecting me... since the day I was born? I'm in, Mr. Renato. I'm in. I'm in, okay? I'm in. Our Lady of lmmaculate Conception! Back off! I'm out! - I'm out! - Chicken! - Come back here, you coward. - Oh dear Lord! Mother of God! Merciful Lord! Merciful Lord! Zuri, honey! Zulmira, wake up! Look, a black beast! He's okay, Blackie. Come on, you. This dog's our friend, what are you all scared about? That darn thing almost got me! We're leavin' here right now! We'll go to the church. - He won't show up 'round there. - What darn thing? Come on, Neco. Com'on. - Come on, come on. - Now imagine that. Good mornin', pa. Blessin'. Come, have breakfast with us. I just brewed a fresh pot o' coffee. - God bless you. - Amen, Jesus! - Amen for all of us! - Come, let's have some breakfast. - This is nice, huh? - Delicious, this cheese. Hey, girl, did you hear about... the Evil One's appearance last night? He took a guitar player with him. They say the man, who was a real dimwitted hillbilly... like the kinds we ain't ever seen 'round here... followed the Devil somewhere... and nobody's heard from him since. Oh, my! Let's talk about somethin' nice, instead. The bread's nice and fresh, eat up! We're eatin' already. - Bye. Thank you. - Bye, now. Don't mention it. But wait. Here, take these rods, so you can go fishing. - I know you like, clears the mind. - Thanks. - You're very kind. - God bless you. - God bless you. - What a nice lady. FISH PREPARED OVER HOT COALS Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Could I perhaps make use of your fire and enjoy your company? Come over. Thanks. I'm Gabriel. I'm moving about. You seem to know this river well. I didn't catch anything, but you know where to drop the line. Here, have a bite. I'll let it roast a little more first. - Are you a guitar player? - Uh-huh. But just for fun. I got an order a guitar player asked me to deliver. What's that? What's a guitar player want with a baby coral snake? For him to pass between his fingers and become a great guitar player. - Ever heard of this system? - Can't say I do nor... that I'm interested much, neither. I play enough for needs. If you like, I can give you this baby coral snake. I can get another one for the guitar player who asked me. Much obliged. But what I really want is a little shut-eye, 'cause... last night I didn't sleep a wink. Thanks a lot for your attention and all. I guess we'll have that fish some other time. - Alright. - See ya, folks. See ya. God be with you. Amen. Pa, pa! Ask him to teach us the sympathetic magic. You ain't afraid, are ya? Alright. Let's talk some more, Mr. Gabriel. Teach us that sympathetic magic. But, first, have a seat... and take them boots off to relax. Tell me. This snake thing has nothing to do with the Evil One, does it? Nothin' to do with the Evil One. It's a tradition passed on by Minas guitar players at St. Gonçalo feast. Pass the snake between your fingers, let it go free in a proper place... and you become the greatest guitar on Earth an in the whole worid! But hear now: it takes a real man... to have the guts to pass the snake between his fingers. It takes a real man, pa. Let's find out if Mr. Baltazar's son's got blood in his veins... ...or just plain water, right? - Merciful Lord, forget about that. Why are you so greedy? You already play a few tunes. - Ain't that enough? - Ê, woman, if only you knew! I deserve this gift from Mr. Gabriel. Why, he even has the name of an ángel! Let's do it, Mr. Gabriel. - Let's get the little critter. - And pass it between them fingers. Let's pick up the critter, right? Gotta pick it up, right? Pass it between them fingers. Pick it up and pass it... For the love of God, Jesus, help me! Now with your right hand pass the snake along your left-hand fingers. Good. Now with your left hand, pet her head a little. That's it. Now switch hands. Now with your left hand... pass the snake along your right-hand fingers. Fine. I see you're a man of great courage. What a fine guitar player you'll be. That's it. Well, it's time for me to head my way. Be with God and Our Lady of Pirapora. - Bye, now. - Thanks, Mr. Gabriel. Thanks, Mr. Gabriel. Thank you. Don't forget to praise St. Gonçalo whenever you play the guitar. Sure, sure. Ain't plantin' no yams anymore. - I'm gonna live off my guitar. - Hey! He forgot his boots, pa. - He forgot... - Mr. Gabriel! Mr. Gabriel! Your boots! - Where'd he go? - Where is he? - He went up in smoke... - He went up in smoke! Up in smoke? Look, Gabriel's boots fit just right on Neco. Hey, Quinzinho! If ya wanna go back, we'll go back. We've been runnin' up and down like gypsies for a long time now. But don't forget you're a great guitar player now. You can do whatever you want with that guitar. You can even get us some money to buy us some more land... provide more comfort for the boy. But let me tell you something... if ya wanna keep on goin', that's alright. Let's go, then. Let's go! Let's see. Let's see. We gotta decide if we wanna go back... or go ahead. - Let's go ahead, pa, go ahead! - Let's see. Hail St. Gonçalo! Here ya are, look... Let's go. Let's find a place where we can get somethin' nice to eat. Then a warm place to sleep... me 'n' you, you 'n' me, feet to feet. Yeah, snuggle up a little, I miss that. Close your eyes, Neco! Do ya remember how we wound up marryin'? Ya was a little turd who thought he was big shit. But we make a good pair, don't we? That's true. What was I to do? But sometimes I think I should've stayed with Teodoro... ...to lead a quieter life. - Teodoro... that hot shot. Look at him now, as fat as a hog... playin' that crummy ol' guitar as bad as ever. You'd wanna lay down with a guy like him? Become Mrs. Piggy? You was born to be the wife of a brave, strong man! - Me! - Yeah, right. A birdbrain, that is. Love is beautiful! - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. I want some chicken, but with "Cooka-Cola". Me, too. I want some of that chicken that keeps turnin' inside that oven. I know, I know... First you gotta wait for the man to ask what we wanna eat. Now ain't that chic? Nonsense! If the man don't show up soon, I'll go straight to the kitchen to... Hush, woman. Where's ya manners? Good manners, please... Hey, excuse me, please... I want 3 of those spinning chicken... rice, beans, potaters, guaraná... coca-cola and... Boy, is he in a hurry! These people are so rude. But don't worry. They're not only rude with you, they treat everybody like that. What a lovely family. Where ya'all from? Mighty kind of you, sir. We're from Formoso. We're out sightseein' 'n' lookin' for a movie to watch! Out sightseein', you 'n' that shiny donkey out there! Us 'n' Policarpo. He's part of the family, a fine animal. I see, I see. But where ya'all headin'? What movie ya'all wanna see? We're headed to the biggest town down the road... Iookin' for a Mazzaropi movie to show the boy here. - We're still looking for, you know? - Mazzaropi? My cousin Mazzaropi? Ya'all lookin' for a movie with my cousin Mazzaropi? Whaddiya mean? Cousin? The man's your cousin, sir? My mom, God bless her, was his cousin. A distant one, yet a cousin. I always hanged around his farm to see the shootings. I was his size. Yeah, right. Ya'all believin' this? Ê! Don't say that, ma! Listen up! How complicated! Zuri, Zuri! He's gonna take us to a place where they show Mazzaropi ev'ry night! And where is this miraculous place? 'Cause if it's far I give up. I got that strange tired feelin'. Don't like it when I feel like this. C'mon, Zuri, I never understood this strange tired feelin' of yours. No complainin', ya hear? Didn't we agree on somethin'? Tonight it's you 'n' me together, feet to feet. Let's go with Aparício to watch a Mazzaropi movie. The movie, Zu! Our luck is turnin'! Hmm, Aparício... "Aparício" is for "apparently"... Look, there is the campsite. That's where they show the movies. And this humble home is mine. It ain't much, but it's yours. You can go off, watch your movie, then come back here. Meanwhile, your donkey can rest over here... together with mine, alright? Ya'all are welcome to sleep over. Come on. - Com'on shiny, giddy up! - Policarpo. Com'on shiny, giddy up! Hold it, Policarpo! Not the guitar! - I never let go of it. - Get my herbs! Get the bag! We better take Policarpo along. He won't like stayin' away from us. Relax. We'll take good care of him. Let's watch the movie. Com'on. What a small worid. Mané, the Cart Driver is there too! Then I put the bait on the hook like this and cast the line... Good afternoon! - Who are you? Are ya one of us? - Nope. We came to watch a movie ya'all show ev'ry night. Movie? But that's for our own folk. Who sent you here? My friend Mané, the Cart Driver. I'm a guitar player. - He invited us to pay him a visit. - Mané, the Cart Driver? Somebody fetch him 'cause guitar players are always welcome here. Tirso, get the Cart Driver. Tell him his friend is here. He'll be here in a jiffy, alright? - Thank you. - They look like gypsies! Howdy! - Good to see you brought your guitar. - Sure thing! Tonight it's party night! Ya'all can stay with us... sleep 'n' eat with us. Where's the donkey, your stuff 'n' all? With a friend. He's a cousin of Mazzaropi, Mané! - Is that so? - Yeah. We'll be sleepin' at his house later on. We came by... to watch one of those Mazzaropi you show ev'ry night. Well, Mr. Quinzinho, we show movies, alright. But not Mazzaropi's. But stay. These movies are important for us. Watch and maybe... you can learn somethin'. Alrighty. After it's over, you can play us somethin'. - Alrighty. - Mané... the medicine you got us ain't doing no good. The boy's burnin' in fever. - This is my wife, Maria Sebastiana. - Howdy, my pleasure. My pleasure. Mr. Quinzinho, one of our boy's has got a real bad fever. - My Zuri's a healer. - Is that so? - Let me see the boy. - Please, Mrs. Zuri, come with me. Here's where we show the movies, Mr. Quinzinho. - But not Mazzaropi? - Nope. - The movies are about our movement. - But not Mazzaropi. No, no. Tonight, comrades, our video is about our recent action in Brasília. - MST! - Qur fight is for real! - MST! - Qur fight is for real! - MST! - Qur fight is for real! The farmer's men are comin' with the police. Everybody to the gates! Things are gonna get hot! Quinzinho, head to the gates with the rest! Head to the gates, Quinzinho! We're not removing the lot of you. We just want the leaders! Just those son-of-a-bitch troublemakers! I want Antonio Pereira, Josué de Jesus and Mané, the Cart Driver! We want Mané, the Cart Driver! - Neco! - Take it easy! Watch the kids! It's not fair. You don't have a warrant. You can't come in and arrest us. We're not goin' quietly! Maria! My Mané... Mané, Mané... What's goin' on here? You people are crazy! - Mané... - Let's get outta here, my God. - Let me go! Let go off me! - You're under arrest, punk! That's my Mané, my Mané... Let go off me! Let go off me! Zuri, Zuri! Go to Aparício's house. If we split up... you go to your aunt Marvina's taking the boy and the donkey. - Take the guitar, too, Zuri! - Let him go! He didn't do anythin'. Let him go! The boy's waitin' for him. What's goin' on, dear Lord? What's goin' on? Neco! Neco! Neco... Maybe your boy... SÂO PAULO NEWS went along with the others... in Mr. Joâo's truck. He took the women 'n' children away from this mess. Look for a place in downtown Sâo Paulo... where they take the kids who get lost from their campsites. Sometimes the kids get lost in Sâo Paulo. It's terrible. Have faith. I'm sure you'll find him somewhere. Where did the police take Quinzinho? To the local police station. - Why did they arrest Quinzinho? - Troublemakin'. Are you Aparício's wife? I own the donkey. Aparício? Who's Aparício? And what donkey are you talking about? My husband's name is Jeremia. There ain't no Aparício 'round here? Sorry, ma'am. Never heard of no Aparício. Mother of God, help me, mother of God! Mother of God, help me, mother of God! SHERIFF Name, ID. Joaquim Silva, Quinzinho. Don't have no ID. Left it at home in Formoso. Never had to show any ID, 'cause ev'rybody knows me there. As a troublemaker, right, Mr. Joaquim? You came from far away to disturb other people's peace n' property... ...and you don't even carry an ID? - Look, sir... I came to town here in the Valley to go sightseein' with my family. - Never heard that one before. - No? Only the truth. You're a troublemaker just like all the others, right? No, sir. I just plant yams and play my guitar. You shut up and listen. Answer only when spoken to. You knew perfectly well you couldn't stay in that farm. Someone owns that farm, Mr. Joaquim. But I didn't want to stay there. I have my own land back in Formoso. All I wanna do is find my guitar, my donkey, my boy 'n' my wife. - Do you know how to read and write? - Hardly. For a dimwit, you sure know how to disturb the peace. You sure know! There's been a crime and an illegal action, Sheriff Peçanha. And these men are not the murderers! Times have changed! And things are changing! You have to find those who killed Mané, the Cart Driver. - Release these innocent men at once! - That's right, officer! You shut up! Gee, I can't say a thing in this police station. POLICE STATION Zuri... Zuri! Zuri? What happened? What happened? Neither Neco, nor Policarpo! What do you mean? They vanished, Quinzinho. Policarpo and Neco are missin'. Zuri, look at me. You still have a little money. Catch a bus 'n' go to your aunt Marvina's house. I'll find the boy and meet ya there. Our Lady of Aparecida will help us. Yes, she will. - Mornin'. - Mornin'. - Where ya headed? - Aparecida. Guitar players are always welcome on my truck. Hop up! Thanks. I'm goin' there to pray and make a promise. She's a strong saint, a miracle worker. Keep your faith. Is that a problem with money, health or women? None o' that. I gotta find my son. We came to town to watch a Mazzaropi movie... We live in the countryside. Then Neco suddenly vanished... at the landless campsite where they killed Mané, the Cart Driver. What's your name? - Quinzinho. - You see, Quinzinho... now everything's different. The worid's no longer the place... where your pa, your grandpa and Mazzaropi used to live. I've been hearin' about land reform since I was a little boy. But the government took so long to start doing things... that the landless workers multiplied like ants. On the road, I see so much idle land. What's gonna happen, Mr. Quinzinho? What's gonna happen? The rich only notice the poor when they get in their way. "Get in their way"... But the landless workers... only achieved somethin' when they learned to make noise. That's what ya gotta do to find your son. Appear on TV, go to the newspapers. This land invasión thing is going to be in the news. Tell them you were there and get the word out! Let's see if the saint can help. They're good, they're strong. They never abandon us. I'm sure Our Lady of Aparecida... ...will bring your son back to you! - God help me. Now these Mazzaropi movies... they are a thing of the past. The last one I saw, I don't even remember the title. I was with a girlfriend I had around here. I can't remember the film much either. But I do remember a song, which went more or less like this: I hitched my ox to the cart But I had nothing to carry I hitched my ox to the cart But I had nothing to carry I hitched my ox to the cart But I had nothing to carry Here we are in Aparecida! Have faith and you'll find your son. Now finding a movie theater that still shows Mazzaropi... is gonna take a miracle. I hitched my ox to the cart But I had nothing to carry A lone man's fate Is made of dreams and dust As I am, lost in thought Upon my horse Qf lassos and knots Qf satchels, the jiló Is a life lived under the sun I'm caipira, Pirapora Qur Lady of Aparecida Light up this dark, deep mine The train of my life I'm caipira, Pirapora Qur Lady of Aparecida Light up this dark, deep mine The train of my life Our Lady of Aparecida! I never imagined I'd be seein' you this close... in your great big church. It's our boy. God only sent us him. He is our everything. Without him our worid is finished. For me and Zulmira. Our Lady, I was the one who brought him. Zulmira didn't want to travel, but I insisted... I insisted and insisted... Please bring him back. If he comes back, I promise to come back here... and bring you a precious gift. I'll come back with my boy... and Zulmira... to offer you my guitar. I promise you. Amen. CHILDREN'S EMERGENCY ROOM PROVISORY SHELTER Gee, I even forgot it's my birthday today. Gosh, Neco! Let's go to the bakery to get us somethin' sweet. It's his birthday, you guys! Let's go! - Let's go to get us somethin' sweet! - Let's go! The four of you, stop right here. You can't come in, beat it. Scram! - I'm going to get you some bread. - It's his birthday, ma'am. - His? Is that so? - Yes, ma'am. It's his birthday. Happy birthday! So today I'm getting you a special treat! Wait here. For the love of God, how do I get to the subway hole, son? - Straight ahead. - That way? To go downtown, too? - Nonstop. - God bless you. Amen. GLOBAL CHURCH OF DIVINE LOVE May the hand of God caress... the heads of each and every one of you. You must bring in new brothers... so together we may express... our faith, our unwavering faith in the Creator of all things. - Hallelujah - Hallelujah! - Hallelujah! - Hallelujah! Oh God, my Lord, one who says "amen", pray. We must turn to God and expand His kingdom... to banish the Devil from this earth... - Amen, amen! - Amen! This is another house of God we have built... with great sacrifice. Before it belonged to the Devil... when this place was movie theater. Amen, amen! - Hallelujah. - Hallelujah! Now you can feel the hand of God... caressing the heads of each and every one of you... Good evening. - Evening. You came to pay your dues? - No, ma'am. No pay. - Could you tell me somethin'? - Go ahead. - Was this place a movie theater? - Yes, until recently. Why do you ask? - Just curious. - I see. We're still full of junk to throw away, stuff nobody wants. See? Trash like cans of movies... posters, nicknacks. - Are these film cans? - Yep. - May I take a peek? - Okay. But for the love of God, don't put anything out of place... or you'll mess this up even more than it already is. "Je... ca... Ta... tu". "Mazza... ropi". Mazzaropi? - Mazzaropi! Mazzaropi! - Shhh! Come on! Hush, now. This is the house of God! Hey, lady! I can tell you're a good soul. Could you give me... these Mazzaropi cans? It's Jeca Tatu. I watched it when I was a boy. You have no idea how far I walked to watch this movie. Well, at least someone's interested in the movies. They're all yours, take them. There's a bag over there. Please, put them in that bag. - Thank ya, ma'am. - Take 'em away. Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, dear Neco Happy birthday to you! Oh my boy, my boy... Where are ya? I even got the cans of the movie I wanna show ya, Neco. Popcorn! Neco... Pa? - Neco! Son! Neco! - Pa! My son! - Tell me it's not a dream. Tell me. - This ain't no dream, pa. I didn't know how to get to aunt Marvina's... My boy, my boy... Where did ya go? Zuri! Zuri! I found him! I found him, Zuri! I found him, I found him! Virgin Mary, my son! Come on in, it's cold outside. I found him. Good afternoon. Could I speak with the owner? - What for? - 'Cause I wanna speak to him. I wanna show him these cans of film. - Film, what film? - Jeca Tatu. - What does he want? - Beats me. Good afternoon. I wanna show you these Mazzaropi movies... the church people gave me for you to show here. No way! You'll have to excuse me, but I can't accept this. I can't show this here and I have no place to keep them. - I'm not showing anything. - But not even once? Just one day. Not a single day. I'm not showing this even once. Next thing you'll be asking me to roll out the red carpet... for you to come inside. I'm not showing anything! Nutcase... Alright, I wanna see if you won't show the movie I brought! I'm gonna watch this movie here come hell o' high water... or I ain't Joaquim da Silva, son of Baltazar! You're gonna show my film, alright, that's for sure! Stop that, pa! My birthday present was findin' you again. Let's go! Goat shit! You show all kinds o' shitty movies in this shitty movie theater... but ya don't wanna show my film? Why not? Why don't ya'all?

You do as I say, boy! Ya'all think a bunch a nitwits are gonna beat me? No way! I'm only leavin' after they show my movie. I came all the way from Formoso to see a Mazzaropi movie... but the theater people don't even know who Mazzaropi is! Now I wanna speak to the owner, the owner of this shitty place! Oh, goat shit! We walked our feet off. We ate this dreadful "all-ya-can-eat" food. Now I want some Mazzaropi. Where's the owner? I almost wore my boy 'n' wife to pieces for nothin'? No way! I lost my donkey and now after all this work... we gotta go back to the farm without anybody givin' us the time o' day? Bullshit! I wanna speak to the owner! And live from downtown... our reporter Toni César with the latest news. Quinzinho, as he is known, remains chained to the movie theater... Merciful Lord! What's all the fuss, aunt Marvina? He left the countryside to take his family to watch a Mazzaropi movie. - He claims... - Merciful Lord! It's Quinzinho! ...he lost his son and his wife was bitten by a coral snake. He also claims he met up with the Devil himself, who tried to steal... his guitar. He fought hard against the Evil Qne and is unwounded... - But what is he doing? - I have no idea. ...the theater owner has agreed to exhibit a Mazzaropi movie tonight... provided Quinzinho unchains himself from the main entry. We'll be back later with new developments. I'm so glad you came. So glad! All right, folks, make way... - Please, folks, that's the owner. - The proprietor has arrived. Please, folks, make way. Please, let's make way here. Excuse me, excuse me. Folks, let's make way. Be kind, make way. It's the theater owner. It's the owner. Make way, please! Thank you, thank you. Friends, we're booked solid, but... following a meeting with our management, we'd like to fulfill... the dream of this man, this great man, an excellent father... excellent guitar player, who came from afar... to make his dream come true. And what dream could that be? To watch a movie starring his idol... Mazzaropi, the memorable comedian! The Brazilian Charlie Chaplin! So today and today only... we'll be exhibiting a nonstop sessión. And there's more! As our tribute to the people of this city, free of charge! I repeat: free of charge! But for that to happen... Quinzinho must unchain himself from the entry. He must unchain himself from the entry. Must unchain himself from the entry. Alright, alright! I'll leave. But you gotta put a red carpet on this floor right now. Otherwise, I'm stayin' right here. "A red carpet"? He's as stubborn as a mule, aunt Marvina! Let's go over there 'n' see what's goin' on! Let me get my pink blouse! Zuri! Aunt Marvina, you came just in time. We did it! - What's up, Mr. Giácomo? - What Giácomo? I'm Giovane! So, Mr. Giovâo, what's the matter? I came to fetch ya so you can see... what your donkey's doing to my vegetable garden. Not now.
