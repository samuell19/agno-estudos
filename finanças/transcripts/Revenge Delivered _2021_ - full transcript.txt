Something's wrong! Remember to breathe, Ms. Myers. It's going to be okay. Where's my husband? I want my family. Deep breaths, Kerry. In, out. Is Dr. Mitchell here yet? He's stuck in traffic. Should I call someone to assist? No. I got this. What are her vitals? 140/90, pulse 115. She's lost a lot of blood already. We're running out of time. This baby needs to come out now. We can't wait for backup. Kerry, I'm Dr. Brooks. I'm going to be taking care of you now. All right, honey? You and your baby are going to be just fine. - Okay. - Okay. Can I push yet? Not just yet. Kerry, remember your breathing. The baby's shoulders are a little wide. If we go forward with a natural birth, I'm concerned we might have dystocia. What? What? It means the baby could get stuck, which would cut off her oxygen. Breathe, honey. We're out of options. Let's move to emergency c-section. Are you sure, Dr. Brooks? She already lost too much blood. If we do a c-section... Thank you. Save the baby. May I have your attention, please? Can you believe how lucky we are to call this woman our colleague? For five years now, she's been head of the ob-gyn, and look at all she's done. I mean, it isn't enough that she manages the department every day, but she's created a new initiative that provides financial assistance to women who cannot afford natal care. Dr. Brooks, would you like to say a few words? Certainly. What an honour it is to receive this award tonight. I mean, how can I accept it without thanking all of you? The bond that we share here is like that of a family. In fact, some of you may know my daughter Noelle. Noelle will be joining us tomorrow for her first day in the rotation program. I couldn't be more proud of her, and I cannot wait for us to welcome her to the St. John's family. I'd also like to thank Dr. Evans for presenting this award tonight, and for being there through every step of the journey. Noelle? Noelle, no! Noelle, no! All right, Noelle? - Noelle! - Come on, baby. Noelle! To St. John's hospital. To St. John's. You have some big shoes to fill, Noelle. Let's give it up for Dr. Brooks, the best doctor in Evanston. You nervous for tomorrow? Uh, yeah. A little. But I know I can do this. I've wanted it all my life. I'm going to go get ready for bed. - Good night. - 'Night. She seem okay to you? She seems fine. And here I thought the therapy was working. What do you mean? It is working. I shouldn't have mentioned her at the dinner. I wasn't thinking about how she would feel. You gave her a little recognition. It's no big deal. What if she still feels that she's living in my shadow? Look how far she's come. She's not like that anymore. You're the one that suggested she take a year off. She did, and that year is over. I think you're more nervous for tomorrow than she is. I thought it would be good for us to work together, but maybe she just needs to be out on her own. No. It is good. It is good, and she's going to do great. I love you. Come in. - Hey. - Do you need something? I wanted to tell you how proud I am of you for everything you've accomplished. Thanks. And I want to give you something. Your grandmother gave that to me when I graduated med school. It's gotten me through many difficult times. I've faced things you couldn't even imagine, but it made me a stronger person. And I know that you're strong, too. I want you to keep it. It's okay. I love you. Oh, look. There she is. Our fearless leader. Dr. Brooks, have you met our Northwestern med students? This one looks familiar. Hello, Dr. Brooks. Hi, Dr. Brooks. My name is Claire Matthews. - I am so excited to be here. - Nice to meet you, Claire. I'm happy to have you. And you must be Luna. It's nice to meet you, Dr. Brooks. Congratulations to all of you for making it to your first year of rotations. I was just about to introduce them to everyone, but I figured you should take over. Oh, wonderful. Let's do it together. Okay. Maddy here books our appointments, handles records, you name it. She also evaluates the clerk applications, so I think you ought to thank her for getting you the interview. No. Don't thank me. I just found the best applicants for the job. It's great to see all your lovely faces in person. Oh, and look at that. Head of security, Darnell Forbes. Nice to meet you all. Please feel free to reach out if you ever have an issue. He also has a spare key for every room in the hospital, including the supply unit, shall you ever get locked out. Later today, Peter will go over more specifics of your duties. Each of you will spend some time in the supply unit as a part of your orientation so you get familiar with our inventory. Mm-hmm. And Luna, you're on supply unit the first week, followed by Noelle and then Claire. It's nothing crazy. Just an hour or so each day. And before you see any patients, let's take a moment to think how important it is what we do here. You're going to realize that those babies are the next generation of teachers, lawyers, politicians and doctors. You never know how they'll affect your life someday. All right. Let's get to work. How are guys you adjusting to the hospital? Well, I already did a pre-med internship at Dartmouth, so none of this is really new to me. Wow. You went to Dartmouth? That's amazing. You didn't get into med school there? Well, Northwestern offered me a scholarship, so that was the only way I could afford it. Still, having Dartmouth on your residency application is going to be amazing. Thanks. But it's so cool that you have a mother who can get you in here after we graduate. Uh, yeah. Well, I'm sure that there will be plenty of open positions. Yeah, but you know how competitive it is. It's good to have that advantage. Well, I bet that Noelle can get a position here without Dr. Brooks. Yeah. Definitely. I was just saying that it could help. Right. Good job today, everybody. But don't expect tomorrow to be so easy. - Thank you, Dr. Evans. - You're welcome. And thank you, Dr. Brooks. - Have a wonderful night. - You, too, Claire. - 'Night. - 'Night. Bye, Dr. Evans. Bye, Dr. Brooks. Thanks, Dr. Evans. You're welcome. I still have paperwork to do, so I shouldn't be too long. See you at home? All right. Bye. Oops! Dr. Brooks, I am so sorry. Oh, it's okay. No, no. Here. Don't even worry about it. - I got all of it. - Everything okay? Yeah. Just a really busy day. That's all. Need some help? No, I'm good. Thank you. Okay. Have a good night. Come on. Kerry, stay with me. The hard part is over. What are her vitals? Pulse is dropping. We're losing her. Paddles. 120 joules. Okay. Clear. Increase to 180. Charge. Clear. - Dr. Brooks? - Not now. 200. Charge. - Dr. Brooks? - Clear. Come on, Kerry. I'm sorry, Dr. Brooks. She's gone. Time of death is 23:49. Hello, hello? Hello, hello? Hello? Anybody here? Hello? Hey. Anyone here? Hello? Good morning. 'Morning, my love. Aha. You got in late last night. Yep. How were the new recruits? Um, it's a little early to tell, but they seem okay. How did Noelle do? Peter said that she did great, but something weird happened last night. What happened? Oh. I put a dollar in the vending machine and my snack got stuck. So, there goes my cheat day. Uh-huh. - Good morning. - Good morning. You ready to go? Oh, I'm not riding with you. Claire is going to come pick me up. Come on in. - Hi. - Hi. Just thought I'd wait inside. I hope I'm not intruding. No, of course not. I'm ready to go anyway. Hi, Claire. Dr. Brooks, you have such a lovely home. Thank you. Hi. I'm Claire Matthews. Hi. Thomas. Noelle's dad. Don't tell me you're a doctor, too? No. I don't have the brains for that. I just work in the garage on old cars and sell them. Very cool. I love cars. Oh. Cool. What a beautiful family you have. Thank you, Claire. You girls better get going. Dr. Evans may look nice, but he hates tardiness. - Bye, dad. - See you. - I'll see you there, mom. - Nice meeting you. Nice meeting you. So, what were you going to say? What happened? Nothing. I'll tell you later. - Come on. - I got to get to work. - Love you. - You, too. Hi, Joanna. These are my clinical clerks, Noelle, Claire and Luna. - How are you feeling today? - I don't feel good at all. I feel really hot. Why is it so hot in here? Okay. I need some nurses in here. Let's get her some oxygen. Can you lift your head for me? There you go. Slow, deep breaths. That's it. Okay. What's her heart rate at? Blood pressure is 70/30. Heart rate is 30. She's unconscious. Okay. Code needs to be called. Code 12. Let's start with chest compressions. Is Dr. Mitchell here yet? He's coming. Clear! I need one milligram of epinephrine drawn up. Noelle, keep up with those compressions. Luna, you'll be our scribe. And we're short-staffed today, so you're going to be our timekeeper, too. Keep pushing. Save the baby. Paddles to 140 joules. Clear! Okay, team. We are moving to a rapid caesarean. We're at five minutes since code. Okay. Step back. Let's check for pulse. I feel a pulse. Great job, everybody. Claire, that was very well done. You showed some really strong leadership skills. - Thank you. - That's true. But can anyone tell me what Claire did wrong? She forgot to put the backboard under the patient before the chest compressions. Very good, Luna. And great job, Claire. But in the future, if you're the leader, then it's your responsibility to make sure everyone follows protocol. Oh, Luna? You forgot to call out time of delivery. It's kind of important. I need that room cleaned out now. Hey, can I talk to you for a sec? Sure. - What was that? - What was what? That should have been you running the room. You hesitated. Well, she beat me to it. You have to be in the moment, Noelle, ready to jump on things. You can't be passive when lives are on the line. Uh... You're still worried about me. But I told you, I am better now. I am good at this job. I know I have what it takes, and I will show you, okay? You'll see. I'm not... You're right. I didn't mean to doubt you. It's okay. I'm going to head out. I'm going on a date with your dad. Okay? You have a good rest of your shift. Thanks. Have fun. I've never seen anything like this, not in all my time here. But I'm going to have my team on the lookout. We're going to get to the bottom of this. Thanks, Darnell. How's Tamika? She's fine, other than the cramps and heartburn. Mm-hmm. Third trimester will do that to you. Okay. Here we go. Let's see if we can identify the perps for when the police arrive. Huh. Hold on. Let me try another angle. Hmm. You recognize them? Hard to say. And you said nothing was missing from your car? No. This has personal written all over it, especially with the notes they left. I'll get some stills for evidence. Dr. Brooks, you mind if I ask what this might be about? If you could just keep a lookout, Darnell, I would really appreciate that. I got you. Of course. All right... Noelle, can I borrow you for a second? Absolutely. Do you need help with something? Yep. I have a walk-in pelvic exam. She's asked for a female doctor. Dr. Brooks is gone, so I thought you should do it. You want me to sub in for you? That is, if you're comfortable on your own. I could always ask Luna or Claire. No, no, no. I'm happy to do it. All right. Come on. I'll show you there. Okay. You got this, Noelle. Strange things have been happening, but I don't want Noelle to hear about it. She's got enough on her plate. And now today, this. Victoria, what is this? Thomas, do you remember that day? Should I? Do you remember me coming home? I stood staring at Noelle's crib for the entire night. You thought I'd lost it. I do remember now. Mm-hmm. You were in there for hours, just staring at Noelle. I can't imagine how hard it was to watch that baby go home with her father. You should have seen him, Thomas. The hate in his eyes when he looked at his own child. I knew he would blame her for what happened. But I still let him take her. I thought I had to. By the time I realized I could've done something about it, it was too late. Oh, god. I never found out what happened to her. Noelle is around the same age, and all her life I wondered what happened to that baby. You think that the father of that baby is the one harassing you? I don't know. Maybe. Then we have to go to the police. You need to tell somebody. Hello. Come on in. Hi. It's detective Garcia. Nice to meet you, Dr. Brooks. Nice to meet you as well. Thanks for coming so quickly. Sorry I couldn't come to the station. It's fine by me. I'll do anything to get out of that cubicle. No thank you. Officer Gordon filled me in on the situation. We don't get too many repeat offences like this, so the chief wants me to take over. There may be a bigger case here. Did she show you the pictures I sent? Yes, she did. Shame about the car, but at least we got a still of the perp. Gordon also mentioned a possible suspect. His name is Russell Myers. His wife was Kerry Myers. I'll look into getting a warrant to search their medical records. If he is harassing you, why do you think he waited 26 years? I don't know. Would you remember what he looks like? I can pick him out from anywhere. Would it be easy for him to access the hospital? He could have walked in and printed those papers from anywhere in the building. I see. What I'm going do is run a background check on Mr. Myers. Find out where he's been. Ask him a few questions. In the meantime, you be safe and keep an eye out. My phone is always on if you need me. Thank you, detective. Hey, folks. You ready for your last ultrasound? We sure are. Okay. Well, I guess you know the drill by now. I'm going to get you to pull your shirt up and you'll tuck this underneath, to protect your clothing from the gel. And remember, it's cold, so be ready for that. Here we go. Ooh! Okay. Let's take a look. Those are his little feet. And... That is the heartbeat. Everything looks normal. Okay. You're ready to go. Ah! It was amazing. Easily my favourite part of the job so far. I have one scheduled for tomorrow. I can't wait. Oh, I'm just so energized. Do you want to get a drink? - Tonight? - Why not? Okay, sure. Where are you thinking? - Oh, I don't know. - Don't know what? We're going to get a drink. Do you want to come? Sure. I know a place. Let me just get changed. Okay. Oh, what's your tattoo? Oh, yeah. It's just something I got a long time ago. Okay. We'll see you outside. Okay. Cheers. Oh. Ha-ha. Mine is a little strong. - Nice to finally take a break. - Mm-hmm. Yeah. We are going to be putting in some long hours, that's for sure. Well, that's what it's all about, right? Yeah. What made you guys choose this field? Ooh. Noelle? Uh, well, my mom was always working when I was a kid, and my dad wanted to make sure that we had a good relationship, so he would take me to visit her all the time. Every day, I would meet new mothers and their babies. And my mom was just oh, so good at her job. I wanted to be just like her. I love that origin story. What about you, Luna? I've been taking care of a sick relative for years now, and I always thought health work would be a good fit for me. Was it one of your parents? Yeah. My dad. Lung cancer. My mom left when I was little, and so, I'm all he's got. - I am so sorry to hear that. - Yeah. It's okay. Yeah. He's been doing better lately. So, why ob-gyn and not oncology? I spent all these years going to the doctor's with my dad, and I realized I'd rather be maintaining health than treating sickness. Ob-gyn seemed like the perfect place to do that. Hmm. - What about you, Claire? - Hmm? Oh. Um, I guess my sister kind of pushed me into it. Hey. You have a sister? What do you mean she pushed you into it? Um, we grew up in a poor family, she just wanted me to be successful. That's all. But then I realized how much I love it. Are you two close? Um, I don't really want to talk about it... Right now. Sorry. Maybe I should slow down a little. Is that Dr. Brooks? Oh, my god, it is. Should we say something? No. Yeah, yeah. We are saying something. - Hi, guys. - Hello. Ah, well. Fancy seeing you guys here. Mm-hmm. Dr. Evans, Dr. Brooks, would you like to join us? Oh, yeah. Let me get some chairs. That's really nice, but, uh, I was just about to leave. Well, that's too bad. Dr. Brooks? I'll stay for a drink, if you don't mind. Of course. Have a seat, please. Take care, everyone. - Bye, Dr. Evans. - All right. So, what brings you all here? Nothing special, really. - Just wanted to grab a drink. - I understand. It's good to treat yourselves. It's only going to get busier. Trust me. I'm going to go to the restroom real quick. I'll come with you. Sorry if I was pushy earlier. I always wanted a sister. My mom tries to be mine. Don't worry about me. Everything okay with you, though? Yeah. I just wasn't expecting to see her here, that's all. Sometimes I need a little bit of space. I don't blame you. I mean, you're practically with her 24/7. Yeah. How about yourself? Where are you from? I'm from Maine. My dad and I moved here when I was in high school. And then, you know, fast forward a few years later, I was in Hanover. Dr. Brooks? Dr. Brooks? Sorry. Uh, I thought I saw someone I knew. I am so proud of her, and I want to be just like her. But that's a lot to live up to. What's your mom like? Claire? Ha-ha. Very funny. Claire! Gotcha. That wasn't funny. Are you seriously mad? You scared me half to death. Yeah, I'm mad. It was a joke, Noelle. Chill, okay? Okay. Don't forget your drink. I'd like to make a toast to new beginnings. New beginnings. Whoa. Don't have too many of those. I'm going to get some air. It's nice to get to know everyone a little bit better. - Noelle! - Oh, my god. - Noelle? - Noelle, are you okay? - Oh. - Hey, hey. Noelle. Come on, come on, come on. What happened? You had too much to drink. That's what happened. What? I don't believe you. You're not in high school, Noelle. I had one drink. Oh, please. One drink doesn't make you collapse. I thought you said that you were doing better, that you needed me to let you prove it. Is this you proving it? Argh. I am telling you the truth. I think that you should take the day off work tomorrow. What? No. This is important to me. I have a responsibility to be there. Then act responsible. Stop coddling me like I am some kind of child. I am not a child. This is my life and this is my career. Not yours. Fine. Dr. Evans and I will expect you bright and early tomorrow morning. Sorry. Just wanted to get her situated. That's all right. Thanks for the tea. Mm-hmm. I know you're really worried about Noelle, but she'll be okay. I wish I was as certain as you. Even though she's an adult, I still go into mom mode sometimes. I'm sure you do. There's nothing like the bond between a mother and daughter. I'm really glad Noelle and I are friends. You did a great job raising her. Thanks, Claire. Why'd you stop at one? Excuse me? It's just you're so successful. You have the perfect life. Why only one kid? I guess I'm just busy helping other women have children. Noelle is all I need. That's sweet. Yeah. I'll take that. Want me to call you a ride-share? Oh. Noelle said that I could spend the night, so... Oh. Is that a problem? No. You can stay in the guest room. Thanks, Dr. Brooks. You know, you're a real lifesaver. Thomas? Thomas? Oh, Jesus! What the hell, Thomas? Where the hell were you? I couldn't sleep, so I went downstairs to do some reading. Are you okay? You're rattled. I just... I thought I saw something. What? What did you see? There was a shadow. But I heard something, I swear. Okay. You're all right. No one's here. Hey. Look at me. No one's here. We're safe. Let's go back up to bed. - Hey. - Hey. You know, there's a fresh pot of coffee in the break room, right? Oh. Uh, I'm okay. Yeah? You sure? You seem a little out of it. Yeah. I am totally fine. Thank you. Dr. Brooks? That patient you wanted morphine for? There's none in the cabinet. Sure there is. It's on the bottom. No. I'm afraid not. I looked everywhere. Do you want me to go to storage? No. I'll go. Hello? Oh. Hello? Hello? Help! Is anyone there? I'm locked in. I'm locked in. Hello? Hello? I'm locked in. Hello? Hello? Hello? Is someone here? Dr. Brooks, is everything okay? Yeah. I was locked in. Oh, no. Yeah. These old locks, they can be really finicky sometimes. What are you doing in here? I was just checking the supply. Hey. Have you seen Dr. Evans? Oh, yeah. I just passed him. He's on the second floor. Thanks, maddy. Yeah. You know, that is strange, Dr. Brooks. I swear it was stocked when I last checked. I supervised the last supply stock. You know what? I'll follow up with the supply unit manager and get back to you. Thanks, Ev. Come with me. Something's wrong with your charts. What is it? You mixed up the dosage reports for two different patients. I did? I told you to take the day off. You said you'd be just fine to work. Do you realize how serious this is? If I hadn't caught it, somebody could have overdosed. - Mom, I... - Dr. Brooks. I'm sorry, Dr. Brooks. I don't know how that happened. Unacceptable. I'm sending you home today. You're lucky I don't write you up on this. Hello? Hey, are you home? Yeah. What's up? Noelle's coming home early. She's hungover and made a big mistake at work. I think you should keep an eye on her. Keep an eye on her? Yeah. I'm tracking her phone to make sure she gets home okay. Oh, you don't still have that tracking app on your phone, do you? Victoria, she's fine. I know she's fine. You're not with her all day. You don't see what I see. Maybe you're just looking too closely. Look, if it makes you happy I'll check in with her, okay? Yeah. Well, there she is now. I'll talk to you later. Okay. Everything okay? Hey, hey, hey. Yeah? You know you can talk to me, right? Look, your mom, she's just worried about you. Yeah. Being a med student is stressful enough without having your mother breathing down your neck. I get it. You know what I say to her? What? Well, I tell her that you're doing great. She just needs to take a step back sometimes. Thanks, dad. It's nice to have someone who understands. A bit of grease. Come on. Come on! Get out of here. Alright, go take a nap. Hey, you have a good nap? Yeah. You look good. I feel better. Good. We're having lamb for dinner tonight. Oh, I told Claire I'd eat with her tonight. Well, we have more than enough food. Why don't you invite her here? - Yeah? - Sure. She'd love that. In that case, let's invite Luna, too. Oh, I don't know. I'm not that close with Luna. Well, this is an opportunity for you two to get close. Okay. Hello? Dr. Brooks. This is detective Garcia. Is now a good time? I have a few minutes. Did you find anything? As a matter of fact I did. Turns out our friend Russell Myers has been missing for eight years. Just up and vanished one day, didn't even pack a bag. Based on what you've told me, we think there's enough to reopen his missing persons case. You think you can find him? It's gonna be tough, but I won't rest until we do. How are you? Has he made anymore contact? I'm okay. No contact, but I keep getting this feeling like I'm being watched. Probably nothing. Don't be so quick to shake it off. Better to be paranoid than to let your guard down. Right. Thank you, detective. So, Luna, where did you go to pre-med? Dartmouth. Wow, Victoria says they have an excellent program. Mm-hm. And yet here you are at the same table as Noelle and I. What? I'm only kidding! Okay. What was the Dartmouth program like? How were your classes? I loved them. I was a psych minor and took some really interesting courses. You'd be surprised at how much of it applies to our job. How so? Well, a child is a chance for us to see what humans are like at their most primal. That's true! Their behavior. Their imagination. The way they cling to their mothers. I find that quite fascinating. Me, too! And not to mention the philosophical questions. Like, how do we really know the difference between right and wrong? For instance, what if one day we were in labor and delivery, and we had to choose between the mother and the baby? It's the kind of... Are you okay? Excuse me. Uh... Luna, what were you saying? Yeah, I think it's the kind of question that gets you thinking. Not everyone will agree on who to save. We all have different values. Who would you save? Uh, depends on the scenario, but probably the baby. It's pure, innocent, still has a whole life ahead of it. And what about the mother? What about her life and her responsibilities? The mother who carried the baby for nine whole months? Yeah. Yeah, she'd probably choose to save it too. But you don't know that, Luna. How could you possibly... - Ow, ow! - Know something like that? Mom, are you okay? Here, let me see that. - Luna, I'm so sorry. - Yeah, I'm so sorry. No, it's okay. It was an accident. Uh, Luna, let's go find you a shirt you can get into. Don't worry about it. I got it, I got it. If you don't mind me asking, why'd you bring up such an odd topic like that? Oh, um, well, sometimes I just picture myself in these difficult situations, and wonder what would I do? How would I live with myself? But it was inappropriate for dinner and I'm sorry. How's this? It's perfect. Save the baby. What's that tattoo? Oh. You saw that. Yeah, it was a teenage mistake. I'm in the middle of getting it lasered off. Thank you. Tamika, I promise you, you have nothing to worry about. I read that only 75% of first time mothers have a successful induction. That statistic means that only 75% have a successful natural delivery. The other 25% might need a c-section, but there's nothing wrong with that. I have done this a thousand times. Everything's going to be all right. I think you've just done a little too much googling. Dr. Brooks, can you promise me something? What's that? Please make sure my baby's okay. If anything goes wrong, save him, not me. I love that ring. Oh, thanks. It belonged to my mom. Hey, so, sorry things got so heated last night. Oh, don't worry about it. I mean, if you ask me, Luna should never have brought - all of that up anyway. - Yeah. Plus, my mom is acting so weird lately. Well, yeah. I mean, can you blame her, with everything that's been going on? What do you mean? Oh, nothing. Anyway, I was wondering if you wanted to come stay with me at my family's cabin this weekend? It's not far, we could hike there. - I would love to. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Okay. Great! Okay! Dr. Brooks! Wait up. Did you get that lab report I asked you about? Oh shoot, it's sitting on my desk. Want me to grab it? No, no I'll get it. Are you okay? Yeah, why? You just seem really on edge lately. Do you think Noelle is doing all right? I caught her making a few mistakes. Sometimes I think that she's just not trying hard enough. Really? I think Noelle's doing terrific. You know, now that you mention it, her performance seems to be at its best when you're not around. Don't take it personally. It's a parental thing. She'll get used to it. I gotta get that report. - Have a good night. - You, too. Alright. When am I gonna get to see your apartment? Maybe soon, if I ever find the time to clean it. I miss living on my own. Why don't you move out again? Well, I kind of went through some stuff about a year ago. And I told my parents I would stay with them until things got better. What happened? Um... I was really overwhelmed with school and work and my future. I felt like I was drowning. And one night I got so upset that I... I tried to kill myself. Oh, my god. Noelle. I had no idea that you ever felt that way. I'm so glad you're still here. Thanks. I took a year off before our rotation, and I am in a much, much better place now. Good. I can't stop thinking about my mom that night, though. I've never seen her like that. I'll never put her through it again. Well, if it helps, you seem happy to me. Oh, shoot. You know what? I got to go. Oh, you're leaving? It's only 8:00. Yeah, I'm kind of tired, so. All right, grandma. I have stuff to do early before work tomorrow. I'm just messing with you. I will see you tomorrow. Thanks for having me over. Of course. Yeah. - Night, Noelle. - Night. Come on, come on, come on. Hello? Anyone here? Come out you coward! Kerry Myers? Oh, my god. Are you okay? I'm fine, just shaken up. I was so worried, you sounded terrified on the phone. - Did you call the detective? - In a minute. What do you mean in a minute? You gotta tell him about Luna. Tell him... Tell him to look into her. I will, but I just don't think she's involved. Are you kidding? The conversation at dinner, the tattoo! What more do you need? I don't know. It might not even be the same tattoo. They're on different body parts. I just don't know what to think anymore. Victoria, sweetheart! Code blue. Room 305. Someone turn that alarm off! Yes, doctor. Dr. Brooks what's happening? Get him out of here. What's going on? Is she okay? - Is my baby okay? - Her vitals are extremely low. I want one milligram of epinephrine on standby. On it. Tamika? Can you hear me? Wake up, Tamika. Start chest compressions. There's no epinephrine in here. It's in there, it's right next to the morphine! No, there's no morphine in here either. This cabinet is basically empty. I'll run to storage! Wait! She's overdosing. She needs naloxone! Switch. Tamika? Tamika wake up. Come on. Okay, we need to get this baby out. Let's move to emergency c-section! If she's not up in one more minute, give her another dose of naloxone. Come on, girl. How are they? Tell me they're both okay! Everything's okay. Tamika's okay, your son is okay. When can I hold him? Soon. They're just gonna run some routine tests first. Dr. Brooks, what happened? We're not exactly sure yet, but I'm doing my best to figure it out. The most important thing is that they're both safe. There you are. You okay? I'm fine, it's just that was a lot. Mm-hm. Well, you held it together like a pro in there. I'm impressed. Thanks. I want to talk to you about something. What is it? I've never told you this before. Remember the bracelet I gave you? I told you it's gotten me through difficult times? Yeah. Yeah. Well, when I was a new doctor, I was put in a situation. Back then, we didn't have the same procedures as we do today. There was an issue with a patient, and we were only gonna be able either to save the mother or the baby. That actually happened to you? That's why you were acting so weird at dinner. What did you do? She told me to save her daughter, and that's what I did. I still feel horrible. I feel like it's coming back to haunt me. Wait. What do you mean? Nothing. I've just been stressed, that's all. Mom, I had no idea. This job, it puts a lot of pressure on us. Sometimes we do the right thing, and sometimes we do the wrong thing. Because we're human. So, Noelle... If you mixed up tamika's charts, I need you to tell me. How can you accuse me of that? I'm not accusing you, I'm just asking. That is accusing me! Just because I messed up the other day doesn't make me some kind of incompetent child! She wasn't even supposed to get morphine. The only way that could have happened is if... I said I didn't! Noelle! Hello? It's detective Garcia. There's been a development. I'm listening. What can you tell me? Our forensic team ran some modern tests on evidence from a cold case locker. We were able to track dirt found in Russell Myers' home to a specific location. I don't think that Russell is the one that's been harassing you. Why do you say that? Because we just ID'd his body. And he's been dead a long time. If he's dead, then who could it be? Your guess is as good as mine. Is there anyone else we should look into? I have to check something. I'll call you right back. Everything okay with Tamika? Yes, she's safe. Listen, you saw the supply unit manager stock the cabinet the other day, right? With my own two eyes. There's no way we would have run out of morphine already, is there? That supply should have lasted at least a week. Did anyone else have access to the cabinet? What the hell happened back there? The board is already circling in on this. They're going to want to speak to you. Did anyone else have access to the cabinet? Well, Luna. Thomas was right about her. Maddy, give us a moment. Sure. Is everything okay? I just need a minute with Luna. Hey, Dr. Brooks. Did you hear about Tamika? I heard. It's awful, but I'm glad she's okay. Hey. You know, I think they might need you guys in a bit. We think she overdosed on morphine. Know anything about that? - No. - You sure? She's not even my patient. So, yeah, I'm sure. You were the only person with access to the morphine cabinet. Excuse me? Luna, I'm giving you one chance to come clean here. What exactly are you accusing me of? It's one thing to come after me, but you don't mess with my patients! I don't understand. Fine. Have it your way. I need head of security in here please. Sorry. No, no. I... what's going on? Luna, we're going to hold you here and ask a few questions. - No, no. I didn't do anything! - Let's go. Let's go! Dr. Brooks! Dr. Brooks! Dr. Brooks! Please have a seat. I'm gonna cut to the chase here, Dr. Brooks. Toxicology reports have shown that Mrs. Forbes did overdose on morphine, and she was under your care. I saved her life. Yes, you did, and she's very lucky, but if it wasn't for your negligence, she'd have never needed saving to begin with. What can you tell us about today's incident? All I can say for certain is that twice in the last week, I noticed morphine was missing the cabinet. The only people with access is Darnell, the supply unit manager, and Luna. One moment. Please come in. I've asked your colleague Dr. Evans to give a testimony. I'd like to listen to him first, then we'll get back to yours. Please have a seat. Dr. Evans. What can you tell us about today's incident? I can't say I have much input, but, uh, Dr. Brooks asked me to briefly pull Noelle from the program so that she could get some experience with Tamika, and things were going very well as far as I knew. How is Dr. Brooks' work relationship with her daughter? Noelle has nothing to do with this. Dr. Brooks, you will have your time to give a statement, right now we're just getting all the facts. Dr. Evans? I think their relationship is very professional. So, she wouldn't give any special leeway to the med students, or say, for instance, cover up for her daughter's mistakes? She would never do that. Could today's events be attributed to any change in Dr. Brooks' behavior? Well, um, she did seem a little on edge lately. I see. Sorry. Mr. Leyland, how can I be held responsible for something Luna did? We're not sure what she did until a proper investigation can be held. The hospital is barely within its rights to detain her. Yet you want to punish me? This isn't about punishment. We are simply placing your license on a brief suspension until we get all the facts. Suspension? I don't believe this. Clearwater. Again? Maybe I should pick it this time. Are you serious? After what she did? What kind of mother accuses her own daughter like that? I know, but she was just doing her job. I can't be mad at her forever. Why not? Who needs her when you have me anyway, right? Come on, Noelle. Call me back, baby. Watch out for Claire, she's dangerous! Hello? - Thomas! - What's the matter? Where's Noelle? Is she with Claire? Yeah, they went to a family cabin or something. Why? What's going on? It's Claire, it's been Claire all along. She set up Luna! Wait, wait, wait. What are you talking about? Claire is Russell's daughter. Okay, and now she has Noelle! Where is this cabin? I don't know! They didn't say. Oh, god. Wait. She's still sharing her location with me. I could track her. I got it. It's not far from here. I'll send you the address. Okay. Okay. I'll see you there. Be careful. I'll see you there. What was your mom like? I asked you before, you didn't answer. I never met my mom. No! This is supposed to be a girl's weekend, remember? Wow. This place is pretty isolated. Just the way I like it. Come on! Noelle? Noelle? Noelle? Mom! Mom! Noelle? Mom! Mom! Rise and shine, Dr. Brooks. Hi. Too bad you didn't figure it out sooner. You could have saved Noelle's life. You know what you did, Dr. Brooks? Hm? You know how awful it is growing up with a father who blamed you for your mother's death? Every day was a struggle to stay alive. Sometimes he'd be passed out on the couch for so long he'd forget to feed me. Other times he made me pretend like I didn't exist, and if I spoke, he'd beat me senseless! 18 years I dealt with him. 18 years! Something had to be done. You know that killing him was the most satisfying moment of my entire life. Until tonight. You see, before I was born, my father was a loving, caring person. And you took that away from him, and he may have been a monster, but he was right about one thing. None of this would have happened if you had saved my mom. Who are you to decide who lives and who dies? After I hid my father's body, I created a new life for myself, yeah, brand new identity, with one goal in mind. Revenge. So, what happens here tonight, I mean, that's just first step. Step two is becoming a doctor. A better one than you, and, I mean, let's face it, not that that says much. Setting up Luna was so easy, I mean, nowhere near as easy as setting up Noelle. I just had to give her a little incentive. And then you took care of the rest, see, I wasn't satisfied just ruining your relationship, 'cause you deserve to lose everything! So, I did what I had to. Dr. Brooks, after what you did to me, after what you took from me, you're not fit to have a medical license. But you haven't lost everything, not until I take your daughter. What's that? Your mother told me to save you. You were such a beautiful baby. You had so much potential, a whole life ahead of you, she knew that. She didn't want to live in a world where her baby died. But you know what? Your mother would be ashamed of you, because of the despicable woman you turned out to be! Untie me! Claire! Hey, how did you... We have to get out of here. Go, go, go, go, go, go! Detective! Thank you for everything. Of course. Although, we never would have found this place without you. Dad? Dad! Sweetheart, are you okay? Are you okay? Are you hurt? We're okay. What took you so long? She slashed my tires. Bring her out. Get off me. That poor girl. It's awful what happened to her. I just can't believe she would do all of this. Neither can I. At least we're safe now. You saved my life. I don't know what I would have done without you there. I love you so much. I love you, too, mom. Come here. I'd like to propose a toast. The past year got off to an interesting start, to say the least. But these two persevered, I so am honored they completed their rotations at St. John's hospital. Not only did they both step up to fill in but both of them have matched at their top choice residencies. I am so proud to say that Luna will remain at St. John's hospital. And Noelle will move on to the angel of mercy hospital in Chicago, where she will Blaze a brand new trail for herself. Both of them are going to make excellent doctors. So once again, congratulations! Congratulations. Yes! Darnell, you don't want a glass? She was the designated driver for nine months. I've been doing it for about a year now, and she still doesn't think we're even! You excited for Monday? Yes, I am. I just want to tell you that I appreciate your forgiveness so much. It was so wrong of me to accuse you... Dr. Brooks, we've had this conversation a million times. I don't blame you for what happened. I know, I just... thank you. You have such a great career ahead of you. - Thank you. - Honey! Hm? It's okay. Could you take those out? I've got another one coming. - Okay. - Thanks. - I'll help you. - Yeah, thank you. Noelle, can you get that for me, honey? Yeah. Who was that? You got a package. Someone dropped this off for you.
