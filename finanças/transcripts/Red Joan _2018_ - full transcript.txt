Would you describe your father as a socialist? Oh my God! Hassan, was a school principal Pay attention to the normal human order He saw Garo's protests pass through the town - But my socialist? No! - Who has politicized you? That's an amazing way to express it My family fled from anti-Semitism In (Russia) to settle in (Germany) It was not the right decision At the time the university entered It was impossible to stop them But I did not hide from them Not because I was a hero But if I did not stand up to them, who would he do? - Well done, sir - The small ...

The smart answer is that when they discovered Nitron in 1932 The whole world has changed I wanted to be part of that But the truth is that tadpoles are the cause When I and my little sister were gone To the pool and take her with us to the house She smelled a little bad smell We rubbed it with hot water We accidentally killed her - You are wild No She made me want to understand Now I'm studying physics here I want to show you something Let's go! from here! Tell me if all this ... The whole world will be destroyed ... What would you save? Pyramids - Perhaps the tower (Eiffel) - Did not those things? Have not you saved any of them? Perhaps this is an opportunity To rebuild civilization from scratch A whole new way My little companion Will I see you at the meeting? Lady (Stanley)? I (Zinoviev) would like to repeat that I am guilty Fully and fully I am guilty because I was the organizer and Thalia (Trotsky) only to try to kill (Stalin) Do you think (Stalin) forced him to confess? of course not He made his statements freely The only ones who claim the opposite Members of the Western press Their mission is to discredit the Soviet Union But surely you can see what they say Some confessions are unbelievable who are they? - Most people in Britain They serve the interests of criminals And enemies of the state who cultivate confusion The last words of his partner in the plot (Kamenev) clearly shows: Whatever my sentence, I consider it fair Together with the people Follow where he leads you (Stalin) thanks thanks very much I wanted to ask if anyone would come To the pub (eagle)?

No I received a message saying I have to come here for an interview Yup! We employ By personal recommendation only from here "Professor (Max Davis)" Looking for personal help you print Arranging in files and so forth But more importantly Someone who understands science This is important because you may be a party Everything happens here So before we speak more I will need you To sign on one of these papers It is a pledge that requires absolute secrecy "The Official Secrecy Act 1920-1911 " Do you have a pen? If our name is (YouTube) ... Do you have any idea what it means?

Our goal is to break the corn - and to touch the specter of matter - What does that mean? You will know after your test period The critical mass is smaller than anyone thought That can not be true Uranium 253 ... I'm sure we'll get better answers Once we obtained Uranium 235 data But getting enough of it is difficult Central Extruder? - Very sorry, I studied gases - Say that again - I studied gases - No, the other part? Well, I'm sure you thought so but ... But central centrifugal force It can separate the gas mixture of the two pairs thats good It's an interesting theory Go and talk to Spencer That's exactly why I wanted a graduate of science The first to be paid as an aid And not just a pretty girl I mean of course ... I do not mean you are ugly - Can we start again? - Please start Imagine if that were possible Separation of the two And you have a critical mass For pure uranium 235 is isolated One atom broke This will generate more nitrons Then more uranium will break down The result will be a self-contained chain of interaction - Bomb? - super bomb If we have a small chance to win this war We have to get the Germans to invent it Now I want you to read these summaries See if you can paint me A preliminary plan understood by the ordinary man We do not have much time An important mission will arrive, not just scientists Deputy Prime Minister (Atly) In addition to Mr. James Chadwick, - (James Chadwick)?

OK If you succeed Do you understand what that means? We will have a say in the decision How can we sleep at night? Currently their purpose is only deterrence This is called to build a deterrent to ourselves Otherwise, the Americans will decide on everything We need a bomb now ...

Only to have great relationships I thought I'd take a book - Become explosive - That's why the reserve reactor ... Is a generator reactor It's a lot of stuff Chemical and if combined all ... Heterogeneous reactor Uses much less heavy water If you take the platonon of uranium Or uranium 233 of thorium? Or from borium? O Christ!

No, no, stop sharing research with us When they started the project (Manhattan) They think that we strangers are a danger to security They have entered into their minds that we Canadians - We want to get into the Russians - It may not be a bad idea sorry? The Russians saved us, we could not Than to withstand the missile battles - Thank God that (Hitler) conquered them and did not dare us - Do not let anyone else here know that this is your opinion They are our allies Now we have excluded them from research Not surprising That makes them more terrified Americans want to get there first They do not trust anyone now They are looking for no excuse to close our center Professor (Kirill), I present to you Professor (Davis) and his assistant ... (John Smith) We met once before Yes, I admire your work at Cambridge. First, we will not know if we We have enough plutonium So we get the reactor guide In a dangerous situation uses heavy water I will leave you to work on it We eat together every night so see you at dinner Second, we plan to closely follow the experience (Oak Ridge) to the company (DuPont) Using chemical separation techniques The phosphate process (Bismuth) Now regarding that extension It's really fun If I get the news I'll need Assistant Graduate of Science in Cambridge (Cambridge) Which has the fastest minds in atomic chemistry So maybe you can wait?
