Sir! A person named Balaraman here...? He's left from here. It's 8 or 9 years since he left this place. I don't know where he is now, sir. From where do you come? - Rameswaram! You people, who got suffered a lot...! If you people go out leaving your motherland... Searching some other place...! You people should get justice. But our suffers have got doubled now. You'd go to Chittoor through East Godhavari from Srikakulam. If you travel up to 360 kilometers from there in road way... You can reach Dharmapuri. You people should stay there on that night. You'd reach Kerala through NH 47 route in the morning. Deep forest of Idukki Jilla, which is situated in Southern Kerala. We have to reach this place. Here...! East to Aanaimudi & foothills of Iravi mountain...! A terrific forest, where elephants & tigers dwell...! Chittazha, what we search is situated here. A village in the forest. Woodcutters festival will be there here in the next 6 months. Woodcutters such as Lorikar & Vanivasang, who are there across many hills & forests...! They are magical people, who travel throughout the day. Chittazha is going to welcome the next spring season. We can able to come here via mountain also. But this is shortcut. You lady! Did you come from your palace? Why is your face looking dull? Your keep is looking dull, man. You stealthy fellow! This old lady will make fun always. Walk there. - You man! Your people are less this time, aren't they? I only know my suffer of making these people to bring down from the mountain. Vinay! Let me come settling their accounts first. Okay...? Walk fast. Come. Move forward, men! Is it enough? - It's enough. Make it fast. You'll get good money. He has not yet come. Right? How? He has made me to keep his things there. That man will be here among these people. That person, whom we search. Idiot! All of you finish his chapter together. Stop it! It's enough. All of you leave the place. Even if you are a sage, you behave like a womanizer. Shameless man! Come. - He's like our saloon shop man. - He is no more now. Who told that ladies are innocent? Oh mother! Goddess! Don't give them such a great strength. Mother! - Get down! You've reached the place. Right? - Give me your hand please. Let this Kuttappa sage stamp the land & breath. You have to save me without making me to fall down. My body is very tired by those ladies beatings. Thanks a lot. Please bless me. - You'll come up in life. Me & my family. Goddess! This should not be a covering jewel. Oh God! Please save us. You need not take your hands. Let me go through this way. Sir! I told you. Right? He's the party Allu Salim. He's a new import of Thambi's contract. He was there in jail regarding a murder case. He's come out in parole now it seems. We used to get this wood contract from the 8 to 10 years. We lost that contract this time. Can Thambi contractor just watch this? Nair brother! Whatever it is. It's a good way for the season. Let me hear their talk. We have to know their procedure. Right? That's always good. If it is not a procedure that affects us, enough. They've started their light decorations & music. It's a festival of getting forest Goddess consent for cutting woods here. They believe that Goddess will decide the fate of this season at the end of their festival. Whether it will be good or not. Goddess only knows that. We got a good profit last year. Everybody got good profit & earnings. But one year before. There was a great flood & destruction in our forest. God! I don't know what Goddess has decided to give Chittazha people this year. Goddess! Give us good things alone. Ramani! Didn't you feed our cow & tie it until now? She's a lazy lady. Oh my Goddess! How many times I have to tell you, man? You only agreed that you would come to take our loads. Right? If you give any reason in order to avoid to take our loads... Bashir sir! There's no use in shouting here. We should get our vehicle maintenance charge to take your loads in Kuruvithodu. If we got our vehicle maintenance money last time... We would have bought a brand new vehicle. We stopped that job there itself. We will take your load only if you pay our money. Or that will be there itself permanently. We won't touch that. Can any good thing take place? - We can't predict anything. Idiot! You have threatened me. Right? Go that side, man. 12000 people have come there for work across hills & forest. If you spoil this season demanding money, they will starve for their gruel. Bashir is thinking about that only. Tell me. What's your demand for your vehicle maintenance? We can consider about you if you give Rs.300 or Rs.400. - Oh! Rs.300 & Rs.400. I can sell those wood & give you more than that. Hey! Don't threaten me, men. Bashir has met many people like you. I've started my work. I know how to take our loads also. Let me see the rules & law for that work. Kunjikanna! Start our jeep. Hey! Law & rules are very low in our place. Our rules are different. You don't try to change those coming from the hill station. Okay...? If you do so again, I'll finish your chapter. I am seeing, I'm seeing his shadow across many trees of this forest way. He's come. Hail the lord Hari. Shouldn't we teach them a lesson? There's a hot problem outside. Will he get affected? - That's definite. Don't say something by your evil tongue, man. Go & give me my drink. - That's it. Can any good thing take place here? Then, no need. We've known about your strike after when we made our loads ready. Why didn't you give us a notice about strike in advance? Please come. Let me tell you. Come. You people used to take Kuruvithodu load until the last year. Right? What happened to you people this time? That is our decision this time. That's all. We've told all the matters briefly to him. If you want to tell anything further, tell him. Here...? - Yeah. Swallow-wort is better than date-palm. If we decide to take date-palm in swallow-wort, can it take place? It won't take place. Because there is no date-palm in swallow-wort. That's the matter. - We have to go there, where date-palm is available. If you trim your mustache, date-palm won't come here. Bashir told that he'd give Rs.100 as maintenance charge for a vehicle. My brother! If you ask Rs.100, it's not a great matter. You can take 2 plates of Briyani. - You can take Briyani fully & work happily. That will be a happiness for us. Bashir! Fix them for the next trip. - It's enough if they tell their flexibility. The problem is solved. I told that Sunny sir is very decent. Right? What does it mean? - It means if we try, we can make him decent. Is that the matter? -That's the matter. Come! Stop there, man. You're irritating us from sometime. Right? Take back your load & chase some other work. Or I will bury you. Am I a seed to bury? Go, man. Raman brother! Move. Mother! Why do you stretch your hands, men? I'll give your needs to you. Raman brother! No. Don't kill him. Listen to me, brother. Don't do this. - No. No. Don't do him anything. Listen to me. Come here, man. Get up & leave the place, man. You come. Leave him. Come here, man. Raman brother's house is there in Aramuli only. They both studied in the same school & same bench up to 10th standard. Sathya had time to tell me about his friends only in the beginning after our marriage. Whatever he says. That will be ended with Balaraman only. We got a great pride in our colony after when Balaraman uncle started staying here. I need not pay money, if I want chocolates. His daughter is there in Kozhikode. Right? She is staying in hostel for her entrance exam coaching. She is not his own daughter. Brother's daughter. His brother & his wife died in an accident, when she was 2 years old. You've seen a person with him, haven't you? He's Maniappan. He was his brother's driver. He & that child alone got saved. Pity! They were staying in Pondicherry for some years. They came here with Bashir sir in a season time. After seeing Sathya... I have to explain you everything. After how many years they both are seeing each other! He joined with us, when my hubby compelled him. What was our story before when Balaraman came here to stay? Remember that just. Nobody came out fearing for Thambi contractor & his people. When we got a person to question their cruelties... Thambi got controlled. Right? Raman brother! We can't go back after holding a tiger's tail. Right? I've interfered into this problem by your support only. Do you know that? There's a story in Pancha Thandhiram, Bashir. A story of a lion as it got afraid seeing its own face into the well. All the rowdies of world are like this only. If anybody questions them, they will fear. That only has taken place now. Right? I've interfered into this matter, when you could not solve it. Thambi contract will not be there here in this birth. It's confident. Am I right, Sathya brother? - Should we say that too, Mani? He's given them a heavy load. Right? - Yes. What, man? Ramani sister... My heart says that it is a good party. Ramani sister! Serve me fast. You people start the party. Let me come taking bath. Let me also come. - Have you drunken already? 3 rounds! Ramani! Bring 5 to 6 tumblers & side dish here. Where were you, man? Keep that here. Is it enough if I calm? Shouldn't I achieve our goal? Shut your mouth. - You don't tell me. I'll cut your neck & remove your head. My sweet drink. - You proceed. Why didn't you do these things already? She's Ramani's sister, who was studying in college. Right? Yes. She's a girl, who passed B.A. She is suffering a lot by poverty. Her problems started after when her mother passed away. There's no use in telling me as her uncle. We have to finish her father in the middle of the road. She got chased out from her family by a new relationship. He got an illicit relationship. When I went to her house last time, I asked my wife to bring her here. Let her stay here. Let's support her. Come, man. Let's take bath & take drinks there. Let's take 2 rounds. - It's enough if they keep some drinks balance. Once I received an interview card from Tribal department. My good time. Postman gave that card in my wife's hands. I saw that card after 5 days from the interview. Whatever it is. It won't be like that. This letter came by today morning only from your daughter's institute. Here! They ran the model exam of entrance there. She only got the top mark in all the 3 centers. Is it so? Show me that. You mind it. She will get 100% marks this year. I'm confident about this. Kaveri would be alive at this time. She only dreamt about our daughter. Right? Come! What? Come. I'll tell you. Our daughter will become a doctor. Watch her activity. My gold! Come, dear! Has she slept? Our daughter is smiling after dreaming something, What will it be? I can't say what will be that. But she will take sometime to get up from her dream. Let's have a dream until then. What? Beautiful parrot! Why did your lips turn into red? Who has kept the eyetex in your eyelids in the mirror? Sky's moon, which comes down in the pure evening time. Like breeze plays on the jasmine... Who plays entertaining me here? It's a function time, when flowers will blossom. That's this girl's wedding time. I have to buy glittering gold & beautiful dotted dress for you. My time is not enough to play prattling this girl. What? Beautiful parrot! Why did your lips turn into red? Who has kept the eyetex in your eyelids in the mirror? Clouds came with golden deers to swing on the branches. Let's join together like dew drops on the grass. I was roaming actively. You've joined me with you. What? Beautiful parrot! Why did your lips turn into red? Who has kept the eyetex in your eyelids in the mirror? Sky's moon, which comes down in the pure evening time. Like breeze plays on the jasmine... Who plays entertaining me here? It's an usual problem. What happened for your stay this time, man? Did you leave it to any new relative? No one can control me except God. Did you understand this, man? - Yes. Who is that dog? Why do you hide, man? If you have guts, come in front of me, man. Idiot! Are you playing with Thangamala? Did I know that she would take bath? It's enough if season starts. All the rowdies will be there in this Chittazha. I've come. Hey lady! Come! Have you locked? Where do you go locking our home? -To shop! - A shop...! Is that a great five star hotel? Those lorry people have kept that rubbish shop. My uncle Lukochan arranged a wonderful job of Rs.3000 as salary per month. You spoiled that job at that time. So suffer now! You have to beg my favour after when this season gets over. You've decided not to bear our wellness. It's enough if you go there lonely. Don't try to relate my daughter with anybody. A father can decide about her. - Oh! A father...! I've never seen such a father in this whole world. Come. Give me the key & go. - Come to shop & get it from Sathya brother. I asked you to stop. I have to go out. Give me the key & go. Wherever you may go. Get the key from Sathya brother & go. Your dog will come for that. Go, girl. Let it be. You lady! Come out. Won't you obey my words? Have you come? What? - I got a pain in my hands. I got injured my hands while working in Vizanral. Without knowing that, I've fallen down, when I took the bottle outside. What about that now? Ramani sister! Clear these with the broom. Where do you come? It's glass. Right? If we stamp it, it will hurt our legs. I'm a genius. - Dear! No need of a broom. Let me clear these things. Here, she is. Hey! What did you say having a third person's key? You asked me to get the key from Sathya brother. Who is Sathya? What, man? He is my dear brother-in-law. Leave my hands. - He married my Ramani sister. I used to call him as baby. He is my soul. A great Sathya brother. Who is Sathya brother? Ramani! Bring that parcel here. He came with a great shout. But he has gone silently like a rat. Did he come again? Hey! Come here soon without delay. It's me. Has he gone? Who is that? - Balaraman! I didn't get him in my hands. Whenever you see Balaraman sir... Why do you get scared? What's there in between you both? What's that? Hey! I can fight with a person, who is equal to my status. Otherwise it is shame for me only. Right? - Is it so? Then? Do you have Rs.50? No need. How much, lady? - Rs.28. Thank God. - Hey! Wait a minute. Hey! Take away this suitcase. Let it be here itself. Is this there in your house? - No. That's why I asked you to go with this coffin. If you play with me again, look at me. I swear on my grandma. You'll get hits definitely. If you say so, how it will be? If it is somewhere else, people will steal this. Right? I'm Ramani's close relative. Right? Don't we have same blood? Same blood...? Don't make me to tell something badly. An useless relative. Hey! Give me. Rs.28. Hey! Give me my money without wasting my time. What do you mean? Why do you play with me? Give me my money, man. Dumb man! Why didn't you tell already that you don't have money? Can you tell this after taking food? Such people trouble us in the morning itself. You can pay me & go. Move away. How much should he pay you? - Rs.28. Is that all? Did you make this innocent person to drop tears for that? Here. Rs.30. Come, man. Follow me with that suitcase. Tell like that. All are worst here. But you've understood some good qualities in me now. Right? Move away, old lady. Is this your path, man? Leave away, man. - How strong this old lady is! - Leave off, man. Indiscreet fellow! 2 tea without sugar. 1 tea No need of sugar. Brother! How can we go to Chittazha from here? Don't wait for any jeep now. A lorry will come. Lorry, which will go to take load. It's enough if you give some money to the lorry driver. Okay. From where do you come? - Rameswaram. Raman brother! Shall I order for tea? If tea is available, I'll get more stuff here surely. Someone has come searching you, sir. Who is that? - I don't know. He's gone to river side. Rauthar...? Balaraman...? I got an indifferent fear. I got consoled myself thinking that I got this fear by my old age. But after when I heard about Reddy... Something in me... They've killed 3 people such as Reddy, his wife & his son in Farm house. We don't know the murderer and his motive, Ram. First Naik sir. Next Mohan Rao. Now Reddy. We both alone are the balance. Let's assume that Naik has passed away by an accident. Everything is over. But Mohan Rao has passed away after 11 years. 8 months correctly. Now Reddy. Mohan Rao & Naik sir. Both have passed away in car accident. Right? Am I right? - People believe like that only. But both are planned murders only. Rama! They only are following us secretly. I don't know why I don't have guts like before. Whatever I see now a days. I am getting a sort of fear, man. I went to Rameswaram with my family last month only & got settled there. Because my relatives are there only. Right? I thought about you only as soon as hearing Reddy's news. But I didn't get any news about your place & occupation, Rama. By God's grace I met our friend Ramanujam at that time. He only told me your details. You'd be careful, man. Rauthar sir! So long... It's many days since we met each other. Right? Won't you tell a word as you'd come to our house...? Maniappa! Don't consider my this time visit. I'll come with my family by next time definitely. I've seen Ganga in her childhood. It's many days. She might have grown up well. Right? I'll meet her next time definitely, Rama Shall I leave, Maniappa? He is looking very dull. I don't know anything about him. He's come normally. Right? - Normally only. Mother! Who is that? What, man? - I would like to make a call to my daughter. Until the foothills... - Man! How can there be a telephone booth in this midnight? You sleep! You man! What, man? What's the problem? Nothing. - You have some fear about your daughter. I have watched that many times. What's that, man? Tell me frankly. Nothing. Nothing. She is there for me now. Right? - You suffered a lot. Right? Try to stop this hectic movement atleast henceforth. Think to get settled anywhere. Your own house. That's your daughter's primary dream, isn't it? Her studies should get completed first. She'd become a doctor as Kaveri wished. I have to give her a good life, then. Who knows the matter after that? See, how he is sitting! Hey! Give me those drinks, man. What's the use in telling to a deaf man? Did anybody... Oh Jesus! Today should be a good day for me. Mathayi sir! Here...! - Where? - Here. Oh! Sage! Come here. Come here. - I was waiting to get your blessings, sage. I don't have that necessity. - Bless me. Come up in life. - Bless my daughter & wife also. I can't see her here. - She's in Vizanvol. My wife. That's okay. Wife. Okay! I've blessed her too. She'd come up in life. Okay. - Just wait. - What a senseless sound? I'll get strength only if I take a pure liquor. Can't you give me your liquor? Sage! Did anybody beat you? - I'll tell you. I've written a amulet for child & given to Karaikudi lady Rajamma. I brought her to my hermitage saying that I'd tie that amulet... Give me some more. Is it that? I give amulets to everybody. I wrote an amulet for myself & forgot to tie it. Oh guru! What a difference in taste! This is cashew & this is battery. That's my technique. Have you got intoxication? - It's time for my meditation. Leave away. I leave, sage! It's my luck. He's left the place. Did you hide it from me? Should I delay further? My dear liquor. This forest is okay for Thambi. This will be a protection for Thambi at any cost. Have you come up on the Mullur hill, man? - No. Climb it. If you walk throughout the daytime & reach the summit, you can see Thambi's kingdom. Pistol is not the protection for Thambi's large Indian hemp garden. Forest! This date-palm contract is a silly wood matter to Thambi. Only wood. Whether I get it or not. My stocks will be keep on going like the rainfall. In your date-palm lorry without your knowledge too. What? Do you have any doubt about this? I've come to tell you this only. You're not at all a matter for me. But he's taught me. Balaraman is the cause for your death. Ask this bastard to go back. Ask him to leave this problem without spoiling this season. Or you will see the forest's destruction. Some dialogues first & then hits...! People will feel bore. That's why I've changed. I'll hit first. I'll say dialogues after that. I'm telling you a matter for the third time after when I came to Chittazha You can crop Indian hemp or anything. Don't do that cheating us, who are innocent workers here. You've seen the forest only. You got these problems as you didn't see the city. You man! Find the people first. If you want to know about me, ask him. Tell him, man. Give this powder to her. If she doesn't get cured in 2 days, I'll give her English medicine. Go. Don't threaten me by your sight, boy. I'll throw you into the drainage tying your hands & legs. Call your dad, man. - He's started in the morning itself. Father! Why don't you advice him also? He can get changed. He is a true Christian. Right? I can advice him. But I will get changed. That's the fact. Leave me, please. What, man? Why do you quarrel with him as soon as coming here? Why don't you scold him, man? - I should not only scold him. I have to beat & chop this idiot. He missed my money more. Do you know that? I earned those money with a great difficulty. I've filled the liquor in bottles, tied it & kept into the river. But no rope & no bottles. Not only one or 2 times. He is doing this only for the third time. I've tied my liquor bottles tightly & came out. I have to keep somebody to protect it. Or he is looting fully. You know this, old lady? How do you say confidently as this boy only did that? - I'm confident. I've seen him standing in the river side, where I kept my liquor bottles. I've gone there for fishing, Fishing...! You don't talk anything. He... Difficult! Rama brother! He will become a vapor in his place itself while seeing you. What's your power, man? It might be by our soulful relationship. - Is it? - Do you want this plantain? Do you want this plantain? Yes. His words are true. Some thief is stealing here everything. Tell like that. - This man's liquor bottles got missed. My things have gone. This man's... - 4 bottles Horlicks & 2 Chandrika soap. Not only this. Old lady's money Rs.75. This man's belongings. Do you mean that this boy only stole everything? No...? There is a thief in this colony, then. A trained thief. We have to find that thief first. What's the use of scolding this boy? Not that. When the thief is there in us, it is very easy to find him. I'm seeing. - What? - I'm seeing his foot prints in hill rocks & deep forests. He's a brave man. He's not a silly man. He's an incarnation of Lord Krishna. Don't try to trap him. Leave him. That's good for you all. Or... Wait, man! Hey! He's not a sage. Our barber Kuttappan! Are you playing with us, man? - I'm finished. - Catch him. Enough. Leave me. I've not got anything. Hey! This is his gigantic form! What's your confusion in staying in your hostel for tonight alone? I told you that I'd come & pick up you tomorrow. Right? That... - Don't talk. You've acted according to your wish. - What's this, Rama brother? What happened now to scold her this much? Your daughter was adamant. Let it be. She's come here without any problem, hasn't she? Then what? - She's come. That's not her smart behavior. She's come from a long distance climbing the hill & forest...! I don't understand anything, Don't tell me anything further, dad. I didn't want to stay there after completing my exams. I wanted to come here immediately. That's why, I've come. Did you see? They are father & daughter, who are going to get placed in Guinness book. Are there anybody in this world like them? Why are you watching them yet? Didn't you see her arrival? Keep that Tiffin ready. Come, dear. Let's eat it. I'm not hungry now, uncle. - I'll make you to get hungry. Come. If you eat our Tiffin hot, it will be very tasty. Right? Dancers have come. Hey! Hey boy! We can go there together after sometime. Dancers performed last year. Do you know that? Young beauty! Your pony tail hair style is shaking, when you walk. We can see the beautiful fish, when you wink your eyes. Can your gold colour get stuck in my hands if I touch you? You flower! You fair beauty! You're a smiling beauty. You pure Tamil peacock. You sweet honey! Your beauty is catching everybody's eyes. walk with me to a place as your ear stud shakes. Just wait. Let me see your beauty fully, dear. Hey! It's getting late, dear. You stay in my heart like the fire, uncle. Hey! I'm a night cock, which comes singing a romantic song. You dance like the June month's Muruga's holy wooden rod with arch. My dear! You're beautiful like a jasmine bud. Come here prattling me like a forest flower. Sweet parrot! Jasmine creeper! Young sprout! Chill breeze! Fragrance flower! I've got melted by your beauty. You flower! You fair beauty! You're a smiling beauty. You pure Tamil peacock. You sweet honey!

There is a great flood in your sea like eyes. Sun & moon are there in your body together. Breeze is flowing in the forests, where summer rain falls. A small drop! A small cuckoo! Silver statue! Golden paste! Fragrance flower! I've got melted by your beauty. You flower! You fair beauty! You're a smiling beauty. You pure Tamil peacock. You sweet honey! Your beauty is catching everybody's eyes. walk with me to a place as your ear stud shakes. Just wait. Let me see your beauty fully, dear. Your beauty is catching everybody's eyes. Hey!

Right? - She's come just now. You'll be here only without making him to get tensed hereafter. Right? You boy! Come here. This is Manu. He's my close friend's son. He's a photographer of Malayalam Bhoomi news paper. He is here to take some photographs. He will be there with me for some days. I told you about Chittazha hero. Right? He's that hero. Balaraman! Take his photograph in advance. Hey! Take my photo also as his close friend. Dad! - What, boy? - Come. Let's go. He wants to sleep. Shall we move? Let's move. Come. - Come. You man! I've kept my house key in our shop. You go with them. I'll come there. Go carefully. Come, dear. I got a great forgetfulness. What are you doing? If my dad sees me... Leave me. - I'll leave you. But I want to your know who is there in your heart. I've come here to know that. God! My dad will see me now. Leave me. - I'll leave you. But I want to know whether you like me or not. Tell me. It's enough if you tell me this & go. Leave me. What happened? What, dear? - Nothing, dad. I've got slipped. - I asked you to walk in front. But you didn't obey me. You are walking alone. Have you seen now? Walk. Can we stay anywhere permanently atleast hereafter? If you don't take any decision atleast now, I won't talk to you. Note it. Are you hearing my words? I like this house very much, dad. Shall we buy this house from Sathyan uncle? Why don't you answer me? - Don't talk to me. Let me think about it. Lord Shiva! You've told this atleast. Right? Gayathri sister! Are you sighting my dad? That's, I... - I've told just for fun. This man only will do that work. - Go, girl. What's this? If anybody sees you... Why don't you leave off? I'll go. But I want to know your reply. If dad sees you... You go. Let me tell you my decision later on. When? - I'll tell you definitely. Please leave the place. You'd come to the wooden bridge near the river tonight. Okay...? Can you come? - Yeah. - You'd come. - I'll come. You go. What? Problem that has come by wood has got solved by wood... Are you making that dumb boy to lift your things? Why don't you treat him respectfully? Shouldn't he agree that? Shouldn't he tell me that? Am I right, man? Sack! Sack! Bag. Container! Fish! Should I take that also? Problem that has come by wood has got solved by wood... A creature like this. What? What happened? Why are you mood off? Nothing, sister. - Dad & Sathya will come very late today. You come, dear. Let's be there. No need, sister. Let me stay here itself. In that case, let me send Anu here. Wait there. From how long I should follow you? This way or that way...? You sent your people out. Are you using my daughter for the supply, ladies? You can read later on. Where is your father? Call him outside. You uncle! Why are you shouting here, uncle? That girl is sitting there. Why don't you have a common sense as she will hear you? Is she a girl? Let her hear well. This Mathayi Pillai is shouting for everybody only. My daughter's fiancee Lukochan... He is the number 1 sales man. I asked you not to come here. You didn't obey me. Right? People told that she has gone by his lorry. When she was waiting for a jeep, Raman brother came by his lorry through that way. She stepped into that. My children also were there with her. What's your problem in that now? No any problem. Let me tell you a matter. Don't make my daughter to roam in this forest with respect. What a look! Shit! Shameless people! I'm disappointed. Or... Can I take so long to read your mind set? I've started to leave this place. But I could not leave. Let me have a look. Where? This is that stealthy sage's photograph. Right? Oh God! Why did you click these snaps? I didn't go to click him. My camera went there. I've got you because of my camera only. Right? Rama! It's not a great matter to feel this much. They are moving for fun. - It's not a fun, man. Daughters will live with their father before marriage & hubby after marriage. That's life. Can you listen to my words? Let me go & meet our church father. I'll explain everything to that guy. You don't create any confusion before that. You don't ask or tell anything to your daughter at present. Leave this matter to me. Believe me, friend. You drink that. Ramani! Get us some fish gravy. You are a short tempered person! You got only son. Can you be temper or adamant with him? Here! What's this, old lady? You're coughing continuously. If I ask her to go to her son's house, she is not obeying me. She is adamant. I'm going to the foothills. Let me drop you. No, man. This forest is peaceful for me. I'm peaceful here only. Then stay here. Move away, lady. I'll miss my number. Go, man. Rama brother! What, man? - When I went to our shop... 4 people got murdered in a family. Mohamed Rauthar, who got retired from Andhra police department... His wife Jameela. His sons Roshan & Salim were dead by gunshot. First Naik sir! Then Mohan Rao! Now Reddy. We both only are the balance now. What game it is? Did you see? Look her, sister. Put it immediately. - Hey! She is failed. Ravi sir! I'm Balram here! It's bad time. I've taken their work in my hands. What happened, brother? - They are Andhra police. If a problem gets solved, I get another problem. Everything is irritating me. What's the matter? They need all the details & address of wood cutters here. These crazy officers...! Corporation office...? It's me Bashir. What can I do, sir? I'm collecting everybody's address. What a rank did she take? Rank girl! Let me have a look. Girls only took top three ranks. See. Her photo has come. Meena, Ganga Balaraman & Amala I told already that your daughter would pass in exam. Right? I've prayed to our forest Goddess. Her grace only. Forest Goddess...? She will say like this always. Whatever good incident may happen. She tells that as forest Goddess grace. All of you move away. Doctor girl! You show your hand. You're the first doctor of Chittazha people. It's a mantra sweet as you'd not forget this place after passing in your exams. Take it. As our Ganga's daughter is going to become a doctor... This Udhaya studio is closed temporarily. All the other details will be written in the notice board later on. Say like that. Hold it. This Baskaran is also going to announce a great offer. As I don't have any notice board... I ask this old lady to roam here with make up. Useless fellow! Go, man. Leave out. I'll teach you a lesson today. Stay there, man. You... Come. Your mom might have become very happy now. Right? Shouldn't you tell this to Manu? Go & tell him. Go, dear. Go. That bird like girl has flown away somewhere without telling me anything. She disappeared like the water bubble into the deep sea. Like the shadow of evening moon, a flower alone sleeps together with me. Don't cry my dear! Your mother's milky face will feel a lot if she sees your tears. Like the Veena music, I'll take care of you like my dear. I'll feel happy by treating you royally. That bird like girl has flown away somewhere without telling me anything. In the childhood, when you don't know to comb your hair too... ...I kissed you with crores of wishes. When you suffer in hot, I'll protect you as a shadow. Affectionless people's life is waste. You, who are the meaning of life... My love & your naughtiness won't get reduced even if you grow up. I'll lullaby you like the dream. I need to go on December first week atleast. I have some correspondence balance. If I those by tomorrow or day after tomorrow, I can confirm the date. If you go from here, can you come again on Onam or New year? If I join, I will get my leave only after 3 years. Why like that? Are you going to jail? This is the foreign people's problem. They can't do anything as they wish. I have to send some photos in mail. Let me go to foothills. You can leave. If we think about a matter, it will be surprised. This man started staying here, who has come here to take load in season. He is talking about his daughter's marriage here. That's Chittazha's specialty. If we like it, it will support us. Take your tea. Everything is decided, then. We have to control both of them at present. Their marriage after when Ganga's doctor studies & my boy's scholarship gets over. What? Let's make a move. - Okay. - Yes. Father! You called Manu's mother today, right? - I've agreed that responsibility. Right? She's keep on questioning me about the bride. Oh God! I became tired in replying her. Father! Shall we leave, then? Father! I like him. Don't you know that? I'm giving my soul in his hands. Balarama! He is my boy. You go peacefully. Don't switch off the jeep. Did you see this? What a get up is this, Mathayi brother? Did you join drama troop? Shut up, idiot! Mathayi brother! Did they name me making me to sit on your dad's lap? Mathayi is an owner in this Chittazha from today onwards. This is too much. - Where's Sathya, lady? Where did you hide him knowing my arrival? Call him outside. Sathya has gone to market. You'd inform him about my arrival. You'd tell him that I am not an useless & previous Mathayi also. This Mathayi owner is eligible to buy this whole Chittazha That is this Mathayi's financial state now. You lady! You've locked my daughter here. Right? I've come to take her with me. If you obstruct me to take her, you'll see my original face. Want to see that? Nobody has locked anybody here. If she is willing, take her. Why should we bother about it? - I'll take her. This Mathayi owner will take her. This Chittazha... I'll make her Vizanvol's queen & bring her in front of you all. This Mathayi owner has that much of power. What, lady? Do you have any doubt in that? Do you have? Did you see? Dear Lukocha! Come out, man. Come. Everybody will get shocked seeing us. He's my only daughter's fiancee Lukocha. He is a king in Vizanvol. Come, buddy. - He's not a king. Only an old man. Is there such a king? Which hereditary king he is! He may be a king of middle period kings hereditary. That's why he is having middle period look. I don't want to waste my time. I've made my daughter & Lukochan betrothal there. Your daughter is here. Right? How did you make her betrothal, then? Wherever she may be. We will make her betrothal in Vizanvol. That's my Molammai's obedience. Son-in-law! Wait! Ramani! Call my daughter. Is she here or outside? Didn't you hear my question? - Boss! What, man? - Please come here. What's your present position? Pillai or Mathayi? I was Pillai. I've become Mathayi after Molammai's marriage. What's the matter, man? Please come. Have you stopped your liquor business? - Temporarily. What about your assistant, then? - He may be somewhere here. Brother! Can you give me some credit? Do you want to get alms from me, man? I want to chase you & that cooling glass old man together. Then, I'll pour something in your mouth. You've brought this useless fellow to marry your golden daughter. Is he so worst? - You & your son-in-law should leave the place. Or... - We will leave the place. Your daughter. - First we'll escape, then daughter. Get into the jeep, son-in-law. Hey! Come. Why do you run leaving me? Oh god! You people, who got suffered a lot...! If you people go out leaving your motherland... Searching some other place...! You people should get justice. But our suffers have got doubled now. Our heart has become strong. Our tears have got frozen. Even if our deaths are different, our goal is the same. You people have taken birth to blossom our world. When can we get freedom? Can you tell this? You people should get justice. But our suffers have got doubled now. Our heart has become strong. Our tears have got frozen. Even if our deaths are different, our goal is the same. Who is that, father? They've come from Hyderabad. Did you take so long to reach the station? You have to come here with a great difficulty. Right? Hey Venu! Wait there. You kids! Careful. - Padma! You leave that girl atleast now. She is prattling her as soon as she came here. Shouldn't she breath freely? Did you hear? She didn't allow me to stay there as soon as she reached Pallimedu by jeep. In short, teacher likes our daughter. Am I right? Why did you come here, Ram brother? She has come there. Please come. Let him also come here. He's come. Right? He's Balaraman. - He mailed me your photo. You're there in a group. What happened to you? You're looking dull. No. I got a slight headache. We have to make their marriage to change everybody's headache now. Right? Sathya! I'll be back now. Balaraman! You just come. - Dear! I'll come now. I've left an important matter in our discussion. Not as I wanted to hide it. It's many years since I forgot that matter. That's true. I also thought about that only after when she came & told me about that. Padma doesn't want to hide anything from you. When I thought about it, I also felt that as right. I told you that their marriage is an inter-cross marriage. Right? Christopher was railway station master. Their family members didn't support their marriage. They got register marriage & went to Hyderabad at last. They, whom their relatives & native land refused... I was their only relationship with their native land. When they didn't get any child after 4 or 5 years from their marriage... That was a great burden for both of them. At that time I thought to adopt a child for them. I got their letter, when I was doing my procedures regarding that. In Secunderabad railway station platform... A boy of 7 or 8 years fell there by stupor as an orphan. Christi felt a lot seeing that incident. He admitted that boy in a hospital. He cured that boy's problem & he brought him to his house. That boy started to grow up there from that day. As Christi & Padma's son. Our Manu is that boy. I never had thought that he is not my son. He is also like that. He doesn't know that. He alone is there for us as our son & daughter. Christi wrote our properties on his name before his death. - Enough! Stop it. Father! Go. - Balaraman! I... - Shut up. Leave out. Both of you get out. Ram brother! - What, man? What happened? Can you make your daughter marry an orphan boy? He gave us confidence after telling us everything, Did you hear their talk now? They found him in a platform it seems. My daughter doesn't marry a platform or orphan guy. Do you understand this? He's not an orphan. I know everything, Father! Manu! Wait! Listen to my words. Hey! Wait, man. You've given your consent. That's why I called my mom also here. But now... I want to know whether Ganga knows your words or not. Call her. Leave now. Let's talk afterwards. - No. I want to know the truth. I want to know now itself. Did you refuse me as I am an orphan? Answer me. If you tell that you refuse me, I'll leave immediately. Or I won't go. Whoever may tell me. I won't go. I've told everything. You go. Go, man. Dad! - I said leave away. Take him away, man. Come, man. - Note my words. I'll take her tonight itself. Listen to me. - I asked you to go. Right? Go, man. He'd suffer for telling me a bastard. Mind it. What happened here to take this decision? Seeing whom are you fearing? For that boy's words... I don't understand anything. - I understand everything, Nobody can understand. But he... I won't leave her. What happened to you? Come with me immediately. We have to leave right away. Dad! I'll come. But I want to know some matters. Who is Manu, dad? Do you know Manu already, dad? Dad won't act like this to Manu for the only reason as he is an orphan. There is something in my dad's heart. Some secret, what we people don't know...! I would like to know that secret. I want to know the concrete reason to come refusing Manu. Otherwise I won't come. Kaveri! Hey! I'm coming. Let me see that. Belt is missing. Cap is missing, Why don't you keep things safely? Our daughter is growing up. I told you not to call me for everything. It's here. How it will be if you shout there keeping your belt here? It's there only. Is it enough if you just search it? I have hundreds of work in kitchen. That was a period, when Naxalites attacks were in peak. That meeting was a selection for a special force officers to face & arrest Naxalites. Police department started operations to stop their dangerous attacks. We people have only aim. We should destroy all the Naxalites. We'd destroy the Naxal camp totally. We should have that aim only. Arresting such a dangerous group into that village is not an easy task. They got a leader, who melted those people by singing songs & giving speech. We can't turn those villagers against him even if our total force tries. So we have to arrest him first at any cost. He's being called as Abdullah! But his full name is doctor Syed Abdul Rahman. He passed in M.B.B. S with rank in Usmaniya University. He worked as a government doctor in Warangal for 2 years, then. He started a mission with radical force there. He threatened police department in Delhi & Bombay. Finally... Again here. He is not a leader for his village people. He is their God. Department recruit a special team to arrest Abdullah! You people, who got suffered a lot...! If you people go out leaving your motherland... Struggle for the truth & our freedom, brother. Take birth newly to get back our rights putting intellectual plans, brother. We have to start our struggle for revolution. Winning in our aim is our talent. We have to get our motherland under our control in this terrific land. Struggle for the truth & our freedom, brother. Take birth newly to get back our rights putting intellectual plans, brother. Who is the owner of Sun & Moon in this world, man? People are the same on this earth, man. In our journey of our lives... Move with freedom & rights, brother. Our rightful struggle only should be there in everybody's heart. Struggle for the truth & our freedom, brother. Take birth newly to get back our rights putting intellectual plans, brother. Our life won't be good if you don't chase out your fear from you, man. You open your eyes & get awareness atleast hereafter. Struggle to change your fate, brother! Know the truth first. Get succeeded by struggling with us. This world is common for each & everybody, brother. Hail our land! Doctor sir! Go & see. Eat it, boy. Who are you? I'm coming from Chandragiri. My father's health is not good. Please send doctor sir with me. Ask him to come in. Please come. What's your father's health problem? He has got a high fever. Many people are getting such problems as they are not provided healthy food items. But everybody should not get such problems. That's my request. Did you have your dinner? - No thanks. - Rukmani! Provide him tiffin. You also sit here. Sit here. My husband will come now. You eat little bit atleast. Eat it. - Enough. Village people are taking weapons in hand for their injustice... ...seeing the city development. People are not struggling for their happiness & enjoyment as everybody thinks. They are sharpening their weapons. This is not the correct route for Chandragiri. Right? Let's go. Who are you? Who are you? Tell me. No, officer! I don't have any weapon in my hands. Why did you take out your gun? I'm not the person, who will run off by fear. I came to know more about Abdullah in our united journey. He became our friend as S.P. Adhi Narayanan's orders didn't disturb us. That revolutionary leader was a brave man. He was a great singer. Abdullah was like that in my vision. We saw him as a calm person in those 4 hours of our travelling time. That man sang many good songs for us. He gave us small cumin candies. What happened? - I don't know. I'm trying him. Are you a Malayali? - Yeah. How did you find it? I know Malayali's Telugu very well. My wife is also a Malayali. She knows Malayalam little bit. Me also. Marriage... - I'm married. - Children. - I have only daughter named Ganga. It's the name of a holy river. If I go back with you, let me write a song for your daughter, Balaraman. Get down! Get me some water. Abdullah is going to die here. Right, Balaraman? I don't fear to die. But I have many more things to do. My struggle has not got succeeded yet, Balaraman. Abdullah! You can be a God father for Naxalites. But you didn't expect this. Right? Many people are taking birth & dying in this country. But you people roamed behind us in the war field. I didn't allow any people to live in Telungana like you. You only are the balance. If an Abdullah dies in Telungana... Lakhs of Abdullahs will take birth. Our duties will be going on there by my songs. When I stop my song, people will start their struggle investing those songs. You don't know. People are vibrated by their anger. We don't have any right to punish him. Very good. Have you mingled with them by staying with him for a day? If you don't shoot him now... Somebody else will shoot him. You won't be alive to see that. You'd do what I said. Adhi won't talk unnecessarily. People, who had hurt me more than Abdullah's death in front of my eyes... His wife & his son...! Without knowing about her hubby's death... They came to give complaint in S.P office as her husband is missing, That will take place by next year. No. We've booked our tickets for Friday. We have some programs about our daughter. I'll call you later. Rukmani's eyes were burning. I saw the full strike in Telungana after that. When people found his body in Godhavari on the fourth day... Telungana started burning by his death. Naxals threatened everybody performing many terror attacks. I heard in radio that they killed S.P. Adhi Narayanan by bomb blast. Government ordered a curfew act in that city. What a dangerous air flow! What happened? It's some days passed since you slept. Right? No. Let me open & see. You took my hubby on such a night. Right? I got him today only in Godhavari. As balance ash, what bullets & fishes left over...! You took him out lying to us & killed him cunningly. Right? Shouldn't I thank you with my soul for your great favour, sir? Who is she, dear? What is she saying? His thousands of followers are waiting outside with terrific weapons. If I show you to them, your total house will get destroyed. But I won't do that. Death is a very small punishment for you. I won't leave you. You have to burn & suffer throughout your lifetime. Seeing your lovable family members death in front of your eyes... Your heart should get broken & you'd die. He is the witness for that. He will be there in front of you. Leader Abdullah's son. Remember this face. This man only separated your father from your permanently. This man only has destroyed a specific group's dreams fully. You'd not forget this face anymore. Go, boy. You have nobody from today. No father & no mother. Go & live somewhere else. Go, boy. Go. Whether she felt that I am a murderer... ...or by the shock of seeing Rukmani's suicide in front of her eyes... Kaveri took a long time to become normal. I knew the fear of the destruction of my life like the water drops in my palm. I gave my resignation in between a great pressure... I came out from there with the police consent. We shifted to Visagapattinam. Kaveri came back to her past normal life there. I thought that God gave me my life back, whom I lost. But... But... Mother! Mother! I got a sort of fear from that incident. Rukamni's final oath. Her son's firing eyes...! I thought that he would come searching me & my daughter. I've run from there as a mad hugging her tightly with my chest, then. I've seen the fire in his eyes here now. Eyes those are burning by his hatred on me. I won't leave my daughter to anyone. To anybody...! Rama! We don't have any evidence to prove Manu as that boy, do we? Let's enquire & investigate this clearly tomorrow. - No. Nobody needs to enquire about it. I know very well as he is that boy. My daughter is his target. I won't leave her to him. You man! Where...? - Why are you watching us yet? Bring all the luggage. What do I have to bring? It's many years since I joined with you. I never had asked you about our destination while driving also. But let me ask you now. Where is our journey, Raman brother? You man! Sathya! Send my daughter also with me. I have to take her also. You man! - Do you know the matter? Landslide has taken place here. Thambikottan's jeep has got struck into that. He said so. Let's go there & come seeing that accident. He's got struck there with his loaded vehicle. - Come. Let's go. Who is that? Who is there? Who is there? Catch them, man. Daddy! Don't leave them. Catch them. 2 people, who got arrested, are Andhra's Naxalites it seems. I was convincing you until now. But you should get escaped from here. If I know that you & your daughter alive in any corner of this world, that's enough for me. It's 15 years since this war has started. I lost my 50% of life as a return for my mistake, which I did unknowingly. Right? Isn't that enough? What should I do further? I should be alive. If I can be saved only by fighting with them now... This Balaraman is ready for that too. Let him win to see my blood atleast. Our informers are there in between tribes. Right? They only gave us these information. Graham team is there in enquiry now. We are trying here, sir. But we don't have any way to communicate with them, sir. They don't know any other languages except Telugu. Sir! This man... - Sir! Please come! We've collected half of the information from the beginning. They are pure Telugu people. You please talk to them. Do you know them? Look this. Do you know anybody in them? Why did you both come here? Tell me. For what purpose you both have come here? Who has sent you here? Who is your target? Tell me. Who is your next target? You... Balaraman is our target. Do you remember Comrade Abdullah? Your blood is the compensation for his blood. They've arrested us & kept us into the lock up. But our commander is there outside. He will finish you. Your daughter is first & you are our next target. He will murder you, man. You... Balaraman is our target. But our commander is there outside. He will finish you. Your daughter is first & you are our next target. You're the commander, who has come to kill this Balaraman from Telungana Right? What do you want, men? Do you want my daughter's life? Or... Do you people want my life? Tell me. Tell me, criminal. Or... Do you want my life? Tell me, man. Have you turned as a mental? What's my mistake? I'm not the person, whom you suspect. It's true. - Don't shout. I knew you on that day, when I heard Abdullah's song in this Chittazha forest. Which Abdullah? Which song? I don't know anything. Don't you know anything? You people, who got suffered a lot...! If you people go out leaving your motherland... Searching some other place...! You people should get justice. But our suffers have got doubled now. Our heart has become strong. Our tears have got frozen. Even if our deaths are different, our goal is the same. You people, who got suffered a lot...! If you people go out leaving your motherland... Searching some other place...! Do you know me? I'm great leader Abdullah's son. Remember this man well. This person only separate your father from you forever. You only made me to be alive for the past 15 years. Though if I forgot my home, land, my dreams & everything... I've not forgotten you. I'll see your destruction in this place in front of my eyes finally. God will be there after giving the final food to sinners. Abdullah's song...! My father's song...! They came here to go back again. People, who came here, have started dominating you all. Before killing them... Your final relationship is going to get ended here. It's here. You fear. Right? You get afraid to see your daughter's death in contact. Right? Why do you fear? You've killed my father, Telungana's leader cunningly. Right? You were just seeing my mother's suicide by shooting herself. Why do you fear, then? Son...! I... - Son...? Look here. Raman brother! Rama! Rama! Raman brother! Listen to my words. I didn't murder your father Abdullah. That took place without my knowledge. This is the truth. Don't kill him. Don't kill him. Don't kill him. We have to correct our past mistakes. Murdering the criminals is not our law. He'd be there in front of us to call back his people, ...who are roaming in forests with weapons. We have to walk holding his hands to make Naxalites as our friends. Don't kill him. Don't kill him. His mind will get changed. We can't be without defeating him while starting to love them. Don't kill him. Let him be alive. This world is common for everybody. Right? Don't kill him listening to an old policeman's request. Rama! Rama...
