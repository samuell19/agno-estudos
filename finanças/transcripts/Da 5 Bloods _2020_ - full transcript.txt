My conscience won't let me go shoot my brother or some darker people or some poor, hungry people in the mud for big, powerful America, and shoot them for what? They never called me "nigger." They never lynched me. They didn't put no dogs on me. They didn't rob me of my nationality. ♪ Rockets... ♪ That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.

Gentlemen, welcome back to Vietnam. - Thank you. - Thank you, man. I have itinerary for you. That's for you. - For you. - Thank you. -For you. Thank you. -Pull up a seat. I still think hiking into the jungle without me as your guide is a big mistake. -We know that jungle, man. -Yes, we sure do. Oh, yeah. Do you have the necessary documents? Yes, there you go. From the Pentagon... and from the Vietnamese government. When we locate Norman's remains, the DPAA is gonna send in a recovery team to bring him back home. Arlington National Cemetery. Hey, man, what the... what the fuck are they staring at, man? Who? Those two right there. Shit. Those two over there, they've been staring at us for the last ten minutes. - Just chill, man. Just chill. - Chill? People staring at me, man. Staring at all of us. Those gentlemen just buy you this drink. They are former Viet Cong and wanna welcome you all back to their country. Yeah? - One of them is my cousin, Nguyen. - Get outta here. And my father's younger brother. - But you're from the south. - They fought for the north. Nguyen does tours for North Vietnamese tourists. The American War turned Vietnamese family against Vietnamese family. -Paul. -Hey, man. Those could've been the dudes that zapped Norm, that's all I'm saying. Will you raise your goddamn glass? The American War is over. Come on. Come on, man. Whoo! - Good night. - Oh, yeah. Oh. -Feelin' the love. -Oh, man. Look at him. -I tell ya. -I know. GI! GI! Now I know why this mission was so damn important. It's about what this war is all about. There it is. All right, Bloods. Our objective is in the C-47. Hold yourself! Hold on! - Come on. - Hold on! - Lock it up! - Cover the Bloods to the plane! - Go! Go, man! You got it! - Harlow and Cots, KIA! Lay down cover fire! Go! Reloading. -Reload! -Reloading. Move out! Move out! Fuck! Jammed! Come on! Go! Move, move, move! Go, go, go! Go! Man down! Man down! Check fire. Paul! Get up! Get up! Team one, take security! Set security! Set security! Hey, Paul, come inside! Clear! Bloods! Yo, come on in here. All right. Let's see what we got here. - Out of sight! - Great googly-moogly. You know what this means? We gold standard. We gold standard. I've run many tours for GIs from the American War. Glad you can now see our country in a different light. Wow! Will you look at this? - It's a whole different place. - I can't believe it. They didn't need us. They should've just sent Mickey D's, Pizza Hut and The Colonel, and we would have defeated the V.C. in one week. - You got it. - Finger-lickin' good. Paul, when did you serve? I did three tours, man. '67 to '71. 1st Infantry. Were you involved in Operation Junction City? -We were there. We were all there. -Oh, yeah. Yeah. My father was there, too. -Yeah? -25th Infantry, ARVN. He fought to the very last man. My brother, give it to me. Give it to me. My family was here in Saigon when it fell. My dad spent 18 months in a communist re-education camp. Wow. Many other were not so lucky. Hey, y'all remember those fugazi Rambo movies? -Sly. -Yeah. I like them shits, man. You gotta be fucking kidding me, man. Him and that... that dude, uh, Walker, Texas Ranger. -I ain't saying nothing about him. -Man! Out there trying to save some imaginary POWs. All them Holly-weird motherfuckers trying to go back and win the Vietnam War. Yeah. I would be the first cat in line if there was a flick about a real hero, you know, one of our blood. Somebody like Milton Olive. That man jumped on that grenade and saved his Bloods' lives. And he was the first brother to be awarded the Medal of Honor in Nam. Eighteen years old. Look, I love y'all and all that bullshit, but, uh, I ain't doin' that. Man, nobody want you to die for them. 'Cause I ain't. Like Aretha sang, "You better think." -Oh, Vinh. -What the fuck he talkin' about? Listen, Bloods, I'm out, all right? Thank you very much. -Thank you. -All right. -Oh. Oh, oh. Be careful, man. -Yeah? I'll be careful. Later. Where's he going? He got something to take care of, man. Tiên... you have hardly changed. We both know that's not true. But thank you for being so kind. You look like you've done well for yourself. We find a way. -Yes, we do. When we can. -Yes. The gold is belong to Vietnamese government. Monsieur Desroche converts the gold into cash. He's the only person that I know who can handle a transaction of this size. -Have you dealt with him before? -Yes. He's expensive. 20%. And I will need 10%. And there's no other way to move this? International export is my business. -It's why you call me. -Yeah. This is my daughter, Michon. And this is my old friend Otis. From American War. - It's, uh... - Hello, Otis. It's very nice to meet you. Thanks, my dear. Is, uh... Is, uh... Is that our daughter? Our... Yes, she is. She was a bastard child of the enemy. I was a whore. Her father was a moi, the nigger. The white GI taught us that word. Everyone want us out. We was too dirty to even clean the toilet. They call our beautiful Michon the cockroach. -Mmm? -No. Good night, Tiên. Good night, Otis. May I ask, how did they end up in your possession? You ask a lotta goddamn questions, wringer. Monsieur, maybe they're from a bank you just knocked off in Manila. Or maybe the authorities are looking for them. I don't need that kind of shit. We ain't no international criminals, you dig? In my line of work, I have to be very careful, and that means knowing exactly who I am in business with. This cat getting on my last goddamn nerve, man. Gentlemen, I believe our business is finished. Hey, wait a minute. Do me a favor. Sit down, please? Just give us that respect. Where were Frenchies in World War II? Hitler had y'all by the snails. The goddamn US of A saved your asses. If it wasn't for good ol' Uncle Sam, all of yous, y'all be speaking the deutsche eating bratwurst, schnitzels and sauerkraut instead of croissants, snails and escargot. Come on, Blood. Let it go. -No, man, no. -Just let it go! No, fuck that. I ain't done. This motherfucker can't tell me shit. My daddy, God rest his soul, landed in Normandy and killed beaucoup goose-stepping Nazis. Let me tell you something, them Nazis weren't no punks neither. Not like you. -Yeah, okay, I'm done. -You feel better? - Yeah. - Well, I thank you for this ignorant American one-sided version of World War II. Please understand. He taking big risk. And we ain't? DaRoach, we gotta trust you, and you gotta trust us. Mr. Desroche... Our platoon was ordered to find a C-47 CIA plane that went down with a payroll for the native people. The Lahu. Now, they didn't wanna be paid in paper currency, so Uncle Sam was paying them in gold bars for their help against the V.C. Well, we found the gold, and we... We bury it. For now. They ask, we say the V.C. got it. Later on, we come back and collect. You mean rip it off. We ain't ripping off shit! Who feel like they're ripping something off? We was the very first people that died for this red, white and blue. Yeah, that's right. It was a soul brother, Crispus Attucks at the motherfuckin' Boston Massacre. We been dying for this country from the very get, hoping one day they'd give us our rightful place. All they give us was a foot up our black asses. Well, fuck that. I say the USA owe us. We built this bitch! So, what you sayin', Blood? I'm saying... we repossess this gold... like they about to come repossess your cash yield convertible now. We repossess this gold for every single black boot that never made it home. Every brother and sister stolen from Mother Africa to Jamestown, Virginia way back in 1619. We give this gold to our people. You feel that? You feel it? - Now, let's bury our gold. - Reparations. Bloods. --Bloods. We went back a few weeks later, but the area was napalmed, and we lost all of our landmarks. But recently, a mudslide has exposed what might be the C-47's tail, and satellite pictures have pinpointed the spot. Mmm. You're more informed than your friend here. Sir, are you in or out? This is my last offer per kilo, less my commission. Tiên said 20. One cannot carry millions of dollars through US Customs. The extra two points will get you a dummy corporation and a tax-free offshore account in Macau. You can then withdraw the funds from any bank in the world. How do I know that you two ain't a con artist team? As you said, you simply must trust us. Yeah, well, the extra 2% comes outta her cut. That's right. -I'll cover it. -Price of doing business. -So, we good? -Yeah. -I'm good. -Yeah, I'm good. And, sir, Uncle Sam did no better than France in Vietnam. Gentlemen, I look forward to seeing you again in a few days. If you will excuse me, I have a lot of things to do for all of us. And, uh... vive la France. This motherfucker, man. I don't take that. What the fuck are you doing here? I'm worried about you. Why? -Well, I found out you were coming here. -And? And I came to check on you. You don't give a flying fuck about me. I do. You been acting more crazy than usual. Yeah, well... you consider me checked on. You're here for the gold. Don't lie. You're going after the gold. I read Otis' emails. You gotta choose better passwords. "1-2-3-4"? Come on now, Dad. What do you want, David? -An equal share for helping you find it. -Hell to the naw! The authorities find out about this, y'all go back to the crib empty-handed. So, you just a lil' jive-ass gangster now, huh? After everything you've put me through, I'd say you getting a basement bargain. You ungrateful lil'... lil' Black Studies teacher nigga. You want to tell your Bloods or should I? You sure know how to raise 'em, don't you? What happens if we bum-rush your boy and throw his ass off that balcony? Know I'm taking a couple of you OGs with me. -Don't ever threaten my son, man. -Or what? Or you will nab more trouble than you know what to do with. -Oh, come on! -Come on! Cool it, God damn it! Cool it! David, you are not getting a full share. -You and your daddy can split a share. -You can forget that. You take it or leave it. You see what you made me do, man? Let me tell you somethin'. You ain't been nothin' but an anchor around my neck since the day you were born. Yeah, I said it, and I mean it, too. Take this shit. God damn it. David, you're a buck private in this outfit. You do what we say when we say it. No questions asked. Understood? Overstood, Godfather. -I have bad feeling about this, Otis. -I'm gonna be all right. Gold does strange things to people. Even old friends. Be safe. All right. Yeah. I just hope I don't have to use it. I'll see you in a bit, all right? - You just gonna stay there? - Motherfucker, go around. -David. -Yeah? Why did you come here? Well, he's my dad. Feels like my last chance with him. -He needs counseling. -I know. Talks to himself. Your pops was never the same after we lost Norman. Hmm. -You know, he calls his name in his sleep. -I can believe that. -Who was that guy? -Norm? That brother was the best damn soldier that ever lived. Wasn't many brothers who made squad leader. The man was using Bloods for cannon fodder. White boys who stayed in college, they'd dodge that shit. They put our poor black asses on the front line, killing us off like flies. Stormin' earned his name, was in all kind of firefights. Trained us in the way of the jungle. Made us believe that we would get home, alive. To your left! - To your left! - To the left! Go, go! Go! - Cease fire! - Cease fire! - Cease fire! - Cease fire! - Everybody all right? - Yeah. - Good right here. - Good, good. War is about money. Money is about war. Every time I walk out my front door, I see cops patrolling my neighborhood like it's some police state. I can feel just how much I ain't worth. Gave us something to believe in. A direction, a purpose. He taught us about black history when it wasn't really popular back then. Schooled us about drinking that anti-commie Kool-Aid they was selling. Yeah, he was our Malcolm and our Martin. Norm had a way of keeping us from going off. He wasn't no Tom. He was a bad mother, shut your mouth. Like Ali. This is the voice of Vietnam, broadcasting from Hanoi, capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Black GI, in Memphis, Tennessee, a white man assassinate Dr. Martin Luther King... who heroically opposed the cruel racial discrimination in the USA. Dr. King also opposed the US war in Vietnam. Black GI, your government sent 600,000 troops to crush the rebellion. Your soul sister and soul brothers are enraged in over 122 cities. They kill them while you fight against us, so far away from where you are needed. Black GI, the South Vietnamese people are resolute against these fascist acts against Negroes who struggle for civil rights and freedom. Negroes are only 11% of the US population, but among troops here in Vietnam, you are 32%. Black GI, is it fair to serve more than the white Americans that sent you here? Nothing is more confuse than to be ordered into a war to die or to be maimed for life without the faintest idea of what's going on. I dedicate this next record to the soul brothers of the 1st Infantry Divisions. Big Red One, 2nd Battalion, 136th Regiment. Have a good day, gentlemen. Be safe. -Goddamn bullshit. -Got the wrong motherfucking enemy! Yeah, goddamn white man gone too far. -The Bible says an eye for an eye. -And a tooth for a tooth. We need to kill some crackers. Our brothers and sisters are burnin' shit down back home, Norm. I love you, man, but you're wrong. Dead wrong. You're talking about Dr. King. You're talking about a man of peace. And that's what got Dr. King killed. I'm as mad as everybody. All us Bloods got a right to be, but... we Bloods. Won't let nobody use our rage against us. We control our rage. Now, what y'all are trying to do right now ain't changing shit. So, stand down. That's an order. Nah. Fuck an order, Norm! You're gonna have to kill me first. Blood on Blood. And let me tell you, out of all of us, your pops was closest to him. Believed in Norman like a religion. I don't think he believed in anything since. Floating market. You brothers want anything? Is there some barbecue up in here? I might get a couple of things. What's that? You got bananas? -Whoa! -Hey, who wants a cold one? - Six pack. - Bring 'em on up. Hey, don't let her get on. That's good. Hey! - Oranges? - Get your beer here. - This is good. - Here you go. You're gonna cut it open? No, I'm good. So, how you eat it? It tastes like chicken. That probably don't taste like chicken. That's race-related. Got any money? --No, man. Not today. Không. Không. Không. No. Let me get some bananas. - I know, that's what I'm getting. - Bananas. - That's amazing. - You see this? No, and thank you. Yes, it is. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There you go. That's great. No, thank you. No, thanks. -Hello! - What's up with that? -Hey. No, not today. Not today. No, I don't want it. Nah. No, I-- -Chicken. -No, man. I... No, man. I... Okay, due respect. No. No. Okay, all due respect, no. Vinh, talk to your... Talk to this man. Come on, no means no in any motherfucking language, right? Come on, man. Come talk to him, man. --No! Vinh, come talk to him! No, man! Back up, okay. Just back up. Back up, please. Shut the fuck up. I don't wanna hear that gook shit. -You know what? Fuck this place, man. -Backward-ass people. -Hey! Get that fucking thing off of me! -Hey, get him. -These backward-ass motherfuckers, man. -Yeah. Let's go. - Shit! I don't know what the fuck he got! - Come on. Come on, man. -No, motherfucker! -Let's go. Dad, come on. Man, it's just a goddamn chicken. Huh? What? You don't know nothing about me, man! Fuck that! You don't know shit about me! I didn't kill your mother and father! Fuck you! --You don't know me! Let's go. Come on. You don't know what the fuck you're talking about! --What the fuck you know about me? --Paul, relax! -Man, nah! He kept coming up on me! -I know. - What the fuck? --What the fuck is going down? -I got you. I got you, brother. Stop talking, and fuck you! -Get the boat moving! -Move on, man! -I got you. -Stop fucking talking! -Don't know shit about me. -You killed my father and mother! What are you doing? He knows what "gook" means, man! I don't give a fuck about that! I don't give two fucks about that. I tried to talk to the man. --Put the fucking camera down. You're just having a panic attack. This shit happen to you all the time? -Yeah, he has PTSD. -This happen all the time? -He gets triggered. -Come on. The guy off with his shit. It be all right. Hey, David. What you know about it, huh? You don't know nothin' about this. -I don't have no fucking-- -Nightmares. You been having nightmares. -He does. -I don't have no nightmares. - You do. - We all got PTSD. - Come on and tell me. Look. - Just breathe, come on. I see... -Come on. -I... Come on, bud. Come on. There you go. There you go. - Come on. - I see ghosts, y'all. I see... ghosts. Well, it happens to all of us, man! -You seen 'em, too? -Yeah. Dead come to you at night? Huh? Stormin' Norm comes to me damn near every night. Now, he talk to y'all like he talk to me? - Brother, come on. - I don't think so. Come on. Come on. -Take it easy, man. -Go ahead, get it out. -Yeah. -Get it out. Come on now. -Come on, bud. -Think I'm a crazy fuck, don't you? No! - Come on, man. - Smart niggas, huh? - It ain't like that. - Man, don't call me that. That's right. Y'all saditty niggas don't like that word. You know what, man? Nigga. Nigga. Nigga. Nigga. Nigga! A yellow nigga. - What? - You feel me? Look, I'm tired of this bullshit! Squash it! I'm with you. I'm with you. Fists up! Get in there, David. Get in there. Put your fist up, David. Come on. You, too, Vinh. Go ahead! Fist up, man. Come on, Paul. -Bloods! -Norm! Norm! Get that out of my face. Get that out of my face. And I told him, "Pick your poison," and he told the waitress to pick the poison. -Excuse me. -Sorry. - How's it going, boss? - How you doin'? I'll be better at the bar. Didn't think I'd meet another American here. But I'm French. -Beg your pardon? -I'm French. Sit. You're traveling alone? I'm here with a group of Vietnam vets. One is my father. Must be something powerful, coming back after all these years with your father. -Yeah, it's powerful all right. -Yeah. What is your name? Hedy. Like Hedy Lamarr. No? Old time Hollywood star. But, well, my last name is Bouvier, so... Cool. It's cool. -Uh, I'm David. -Ah, David from the Bible. Like David Ruffin from the Temptations. Motown. Yeah, you got it. Is there another place to go at night around here? Have you ever seen so many scooters in your life? Thank you. So... what's their story? Well, Simon is my best friend. And Seppo and I use each other for sex once in a blue moon. What do you, Simon and Sep... Seppo... Seppo... what do you do? We locate old landmines, and detonate bombs, too. Wow! - Wow, okay. - "Wow, okay!" Yeah, that's some gangster shit. For sure! How does one get involved in the landmine disposal business? Pray tell. The Bouviers have a history in Vietnam. It's strange how a war never ends for those involved. See, like, landmines planted years ago... and still harvesting death all these years later. Back to your family history. My family made several fortunes owning a rubber plantation, and then they bought up much more of the rice market and made another fortune. See, the white gold. Hmm. Wonderful family business. But one exception, we exploited the shit out of the Vietnamese people. So, that's the meaning behind the mines. So, what did the Bouvier family think about what you do? What family? I'm the founder and the director of LAMB, which I started three years ago. LAMB? Yeah, LAMB. Love Against Mines and Bombs. No. I must look like some Patty Hearst heiress who's cast herself as a guilt-ridden bourgeoisie cliché. Hey, look, I know all about bourgeoisie clichés. I'm a poverty-stricken fool who loves teaching kids. However, my guilt trip is a lot less dangerous than yours. -Yeah, less dangerous. -Yeah. Unless you count school shootings. School shootings. No fun. You always been the solid one, always. Got a... wife who loves you. Daughter who loves you. You got a son who loves you enough for two daddies. I couldn't love David... back. You got back to the world, you made that transition. Me, I'm all... fucked up inside. I'm broken, man. Broken. - Fuck. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. -Blood, we're all broken. -Not like me, man. Norm and I were holding those gooks back when the man bought it. I see him. I saw him die, man. -So what? You're blaming yourself? -You don't even know. Paul, when we get back to the world, I'd like you to come with me to a meeting. I don't do that "sit in a circle, whine about shit" group thing, man. I don't do it. I never have and I never will. You got to talk to somebody. I talk to my brother Stormin' Norman every single night. -Yeah. - Oh, oh, oh, drink, drink. Whoa. Hey. Simon. -David. -David. Okay. How's it going? I can't call it. Hey, that dude over there by the bar, is he with you? -He's getting pretty shit-faced. -Uh-huh. Brotherman. It's been an emotional trip. It appears so. You Americans are just incredibly uninformed. I guess you're too busy watching reality TV, or electing a reality TV clown for a president. Knew that was coming. Well, on behalf of all the black folks in the USA, which are the only group who didn't vote for the motherfucker, we plead innocent to all charges, claims, accusations, allegations, and associations connected to the Klansman in the Oval Office, so help me God. The Bloods search for the lost treasure of youth and the remains of the dearly departed Norman Earl Holloway... -We're going. -...KIA, December 7th, 1971. We're here to bring home a fallen brother. A brother! A tomb is sacred, not to be looted by rogues and vandals. There's gold in them hills! Gold, goddamn it, gold! Thanks for getting us this far, Vinh. My pleasure. I gotta tell you, you put on one hell of a tour. - Sure do. Thanks Vinhi-vin. - You're welcome. Nothing is more precious than independence and liberty.

This the spot, right here? - Wait, I see something here. - Watch your fingers. - Otis, it's right there. - Mind your hand. Look out. Look out for your hands. - Let's go.

Where? -Right here. -I got it! - Right there! - I got it! I got it! I got it! - Got that one? - Yeah. All right, go. - I got another one! - I got it! -I got another one right here. -I'm coming! -Right there. -All right. - You good? - I'm good. - I got a hit! - Oh, shit!

I find the motherfucking gold! -Fuck you! -Silly-ass. - Watch your fingers. - Come on! Keep digging! Forty-five thousand per bar. Seventeen million all in. Yeah. But I'm not leaving here without Norman. You think Norman cares whether you find his remains or not? You remember what Norman said. "That gold should go to our people." Whoa, what you trying to say, man? That gold should go towards black liberation. Yeah, our black liberation. You do for self. I'm talking about black reparations, man. I got mine's. What about our people? What about my people? You do what you want with your share, and we'll each decide for ourselves. -That's what Norman said now. -Now, see? See? Otis knows. Norman wanted that gold to go towards the cause. Yeah, that's easy for you to say, Eddie. You rich. Money don't mean shit to you. -I am not rich. -Yeah, right. Whatever. - I'm not rich! - Okay. -I'm broke, man. -How the fuck are you broke, Eddie? Huh? -I lost it all. -Oh, he bullshittin'. I wish I was, man. Spill it. Come on, man. Fess up. Ex-wives, bad investments, back taxes, livin' large, drinking, being stupid. -You fuckin' name it, I spent money on it. -But you paid for all of this shit. Yeah, yeah, I paid for all this shit on a black card that's already overdrawn. What about all them car dealerships with your name on 'em? I don't own 'em. I mean, my name is good in the business and all, and... dealers choose to use 'em, but... they'll pull that shit as soon as it stops working for 'em. I'm telling you, I ain't got a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of. And that's facts! God damn. Sorry, bro. Can we just go find Norm? Stormin' Norm's been waiting. Damn. Ain't that some doo-doo. Hey, Bloods, I got something! Right here I got... I'm getting a big hit. -I'm getting a big hit, right here. -Are you sure? Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's all over, right in here. Right in this whole area. It's a big hit. Right here. Right here. Right in here, baby. Right in there. Oh, my God! Oh, God! That's... Shit. It's Norm. Oh, brother. It's Norm? - Yeah, it's Norm. - Oh, shit. Okay. Okay. Holy shit. Come on. Shit. Shit. Shit. Hey, Norm. We all here, man. Otis, Melvin, Eddie. I got my son, David. Right here. Took us a little longer than we thought, but... we came back like we said we would. But this time when we get on that plane, that Freedom Bird, going back to the world, you are coming with us, brother. You coming with us, brother. Now, both of your parents have passed, I guess you know that, but your sisters, Janet and Kim, will be waiting for us... when we land, brother. You goin' home, Blood. You're goin' home, Blood. Come on, now. Blessed holy God. We come around your mighty throne of grace... to thank you for this day. We thank you for the reunion of family... and friendship... and the brotherhood. Continuing in prayer, Lord, we ask you for traveling grace... and the mending of hearts. In your son's righteous and holy name, we pray. -Amen. - Amen. Damn! What is that sound? Uh, cicadas. -Cicadas? -Yeah. They don't sound like that back home. We ain't home, son. We ain't home. - You all right? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, son, get this off of me, man. - All right. - I got it. - Just let it drop. - Let it go. Hand me my water, man. Hydrate. - Lord have mercy. - My man. Hey, I can manage another 30, 40 pounds. -Yeah. -That be just great, bud. My son play the pack mule, my son gets a fair share. -It's fine, Dad. It's fine. -No, the hell it is. When did you turn into a grade-A, first-rate, certified, old, tired and crazy motherfucker? Ah, fuck you, man. When you've been cheated in life as much as I have, you learn to spot the sign of all them dirty rat bastards out there. - How much you need, huh? - Huh? That enough? You want more? -Man, get that out of my fucking face. -Huh? Do you remember? You remember what Norm said about money? I don't remember that. No, no, no. I am sick and tired of trying to get you fools to love one another. Go ahead! You wanna tear each other apart, go on. Go on! Here I thought... I hoped that we could be Bloods one more time. But, no, that ain't gonna never happen again because of this. Traded brotherhood for this shit. Right, Paul? That motherfucker walks backward pigeon-toed. "Eddie, you black as a damn crow Ain't white like snow And if you didn't know If you ain't got no dough Then you don't go And that's for damn sure" Yeah, well, my mama told me... ...that money is the root of all-- Oh, shit! -Oh, my God! -What the fuck? Eddie. - Fuck. - Oh! What? - Otis, don't move! It's a minefield! - Eddie! It's a minefield! Don't move, Otis. Okay, okay, okay. Shh. I got you. I got you. I got you. I got you. I got you. -I got you. -Bloods. Jesus! -Jesus! -What? Jesus! Dad! Dad! I think I stepped on something. - Whoa! Stay right there. - Motherfucker! David, don't move. Don't move. - David! - Hey! - Everybody freeze! - Everybody okay? Hey! Dad, no, no! Put it down! Put it down! They can help! - We were just walking back to our camp. - He stepped on something. -Is it a pressure plate? -Well, if it was, he would be dead. Uh, maybe it's a dud. Or maybe it's not. We can help you. Look! Look! He can help. Okay, come on. And, David... don't move. What are we gonna do about my son? Well, all he can do is lift up his foot and pray to God it doesn't explode. There's gotta be something else we can do. Well, if there is, I don't know it. Fuck. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Jethro Bodine. -What? -Who? Remember that big ol' hillbilly kid from Oklahoma? He stepped on a toe popper. Remember? -Yeah. Yeah. -Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, we're gonna spring my son... the same way we sprung that hillbilly kid, you got me? Yeah, that'll work. That'll work. Give me that rope. Where am I walking? Where am I walking? Straight to me, I swept it. You're good. You're good. Do us both a favor. Don't fucking shift your weight, okay? Stay right where you are. David, I want you to take this rope. I want you to wrap this rope around your body. Two times. Go ahead. Twice around your body. Go on, like that. There you go. High as you can, man. High as you can. Right. David look at me. Where did you go to college? -The House. -The House. Who went to The House? -Come on. -Edwin Moses. The class of '78. -Come on. What he'd do? -Won two Olympic gold medals. -Yeah. -Four hundred meter hurdles. He took 13 steps between each hurdle. Everybody else took 15. David, that man could fly. What you gonna do? -What you gonna do, David? -Fly. -Like? -Fly like Moses. I want everybody to take a piece of this rope. Back on up. Otis, back on up. Back it on up, man. You, too, Mel. Back it on up. All right. - Here, take this. - That's good, big man. -That's good, big man! Right there. -Yeah. Fuck. Fuck. - Get that slack! - Tighten up! Now, everybody... you get an armful and a handful of rope. -We good? -We good. I hear you. On count of three, you pull harder than a motherfucker! Yeah, baby. You got me? - We got you, Blood. - Got you. All right. One... two... three! Come on, man. God is great. Okay. All right. Now... - What the fuck? - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Get on your knees. If you get... Get on your fucking knees. -Dad. -Put that damn gun down now! We're compromised, Melvin. Okay, okay, okay. Just take it easy now. Whatever you're doing, it's none of our business. We can just go. Otis, the sound of those blasts traveled, man. Somebody is on their way here right now. - We gotta get the gold and get outta here. - You serious? -We gotta get somebody for Eddie, Dad. -Hey, man. American Embassy. Somebody. -We can't tell nobody nothing. -Just slow the fuck down, man. We have to bury Eddie. Are you deaf, man? Are you deaf? Are you deaf? We gotta get out of here, Otis! -I'm not leaving Eddie like that! -I can be helpful to you. You can be helpful? Okay. Can you bring back the dead? Huh? - Get the rope, tie 'em up. - Not doing it. Let's just talk about it. Otis, you ain't giving the orders, man. I'm running shit now. Dad! Dad! Dad nothing. Dad nothing. Dad nothing! Boy, I've killed far better men than you, and I will not hesitate to plug a hole in you right now. David, tie 'em up. You want your share? Tie 'em up. You wanna remain my son? Get at it. Get at it. Come here, son. Come here. Come here. - All right. - Give me your hand. You had me fooled. You got something to say? You say it to me. Not my son. Let me tell y'all something. I'm the motherfucker. I... am the motherfucker. I'm the motherfucker. I'm the motherfucker. So long, Blood. Rest in power. Amen. -Amen. -Amen. We should give Eddie's share to his family. It's the right thing to do, y'all. And David? That's my boy. He deserves a fair share. Deal? - Deal. - All right. I can't believe I was actually... jealous of you, back at that bar. Yeah. You seemed so fuckin' sure of yourself. Should've known you're actually just a spineless fucking rat. Hedy, you can't still want this guy. Look at him, his father's gonna kill us. Seppo, shut up. Well, your father scares me more than landmines. Shut the hell up, up there. -Yeah, over here. -Here? Mmm-hmm. Take us about a day, and we get to... You be careful with this OxyContin shit. It can be addictive. -Where were we? -What about right here? -But I think that Vinh should-- -Mmm-mmm. Mmm-mmm. Vinh is out. He in cahoots with Charlie. Ain't that right, traitor? If you don't trust me by now... just shoot me... when you kill them. What the hell is that? Night vision, baby. Night vision. Let's see what's shaking. I need to urinate. -She needs to pee. -Yeah, I heard her. I'm not deaf. Yeah, I know the Geneva Convention's off the table, but maybe just let her take a piss. Well, could you untie my hands? Please. You gotta go, you gotta go. Fast, all right? -To the tree. David, don't you want the first time I unzip and remove my pants to be under better circumstances? Were you flirting with me the other night because you were looking for an easy fuck or because you were actually interested in me? -Actually, I'm interested. -Uh-huh? Yeah. You left your wealthy family behind to do something good, help people, kids. And you're fine, too. I ain't gonna lie. Wow. Then let me go. Give me a ten-minute head start. All I ask, please? Hmm? You know, I hate to cockblock. She cute, though. Mel, take her back to the tree. You better listen to your pop, son. You're a worthless fuck. Just so you know, I was only trying to escape. I wouldn't fuck you for all the gold in the world. Just what I thought. Just what I thought. Mel, you make sure that rope is tight. - Oh, yeah. - Hey, Dad. Okay. Okay. - God damn! - Get the gun! - God damn! - I got the gun. Drag his ass over there. Drag his ass over there. - Seppo's loose! Give me the gun! - Get him. I'll crack your head open! I knew it! I knew it! Another motherfucking dope fiend double-cross. David, you don't see what Otis is doing? You're playin' into his fuckin' hands! Your dear mother would be ashamed of you! Yeah, you ain't no fuckin' son of mine! You're dead to me. You hear me? - Get the rope. - Gone! Buried! - Get the rope. - You're a fucking coward. -Fucking disgrace! -Get the rope! Get the rope, David. Don't get shit. You stay your ass right the fuck there. You stay your ass right the fuck there! You've had quite an adventure. -My friend, let me help. -Oh, no. I got it, I got it. Thank you. Thank you, I got it. Hey. -Get this off of me. -Where's Eddie? Broke his ankle. We left him with food and water. He insisted. That boy is stubborn as an old mule. - Sounds very bad. - Yeah. I knew you should not have gone alone. I have a friend in the district. He'll send a rescue group. How would you like to earn more money than you ever earned in your whole life? Eddie didn't break an ankle, did he? No. Help me. You kill him? Oh, God, no. Minefield. Otis! -Huh? -Here come your partners. Ain't no partners of mine. Hedy! - Hedy! - Seppo! Seppo! Seppo! -He said you have his gold. Forget that. We trade your friend for gold. He ain't our friend! -What? -You heard me. Hedy, for God's sakes, help me. David, you've got to help him. Otis? Please. We want him alive. -Fuck! -Fuck. We can share. There's enough for everybody. What's he saying? I like you. Black Uncle Sam. We share. - This for you, rest for us. - Hey! Look, man, we're Americans, all right? You kill us or hurt him, you got an international fiasco on your hands. We're not gonna kill anyone... yet. You heard him. Nobody gets nothing. Nothing! Black Uncle Sam, this is belong to Vietnamese people. We take what is ours. Hey, boy, you ain't taking what's ours. You look on that gold bar right there, it says USA, my friend. You, USA? Damn skippy. -It say USA, but I don't think so. -Well, you better believe it. Who the fuck are you, man? - We? - Uh-huh. You. Vietnam officer. Oh, yeah? Where are your official badges? We don't need no stinkin' official badges. Do you know Calley, brother? Yeah. And first of all, you ain't my brother, and I know California, yeah. You imbecile. It's not a state. Lt. Calley. Ever heard of My Lai? I know all about My Lai. And you, GI murder, killer of innocent children and babies. There were atrocities on both sides. So why don't you go chew on some motherfucking chopsticks? -Chill, chill, chill. -No, no, fuck him! "Make America great again." I show you something! - Simon! - Oh, fuck! Chavy! Chavy! - Simon! - Stay down! Come on! Come on! Chavy! Where's Norm? -He's gone, man. KIA. -Oh! Đi đi mau! Let's move. -Go ahead. Go ahead! -Đi đi mau! Go ahead. I got this. Okay.

Clean through and through. - Press this on. Press it down. - Seppo. I know, boy. I know. There you go. All right. Just keep the pressure on. Breathe through it. Just breathe through it. Keep on going. Keep on. All right. Press this. Press this on. Here we go. Press it on. Press it on! Press it. Press it tight. All right, I know. I know. I know. I know, come on. All right, you got this. Move your hand! I know. There you go. Man, it's gotta be tight. Clean through and through. - There you go. Hold on. - Hey! Straighten up! Straighten up! All right. All right, hold on. It's all right. How he doin'? - You'll survive. You'll survive. - How's he doing, man? That's nothing but a mosquito bite. - Don't fuck it up, man. - Come on. Come on. Man the hell up. -All right. All right. All right. -Okay, look... First thing that gook's gonna do when he gets back to town, he gonna round up all the local muscle he can. Now look. Who you callin'? I'm calling Tiên. She can get us out of here. - What the fuck you do that for? - What the fuck... - I should shoot your crazy ass dead. - Do it. Ain't nothing to it but to do it, Blood. Don't tempt me, motherfucker. What the fuck is wrong with you guys? Brother. We have very little gas left. Perhaps enough gas to get to the temple ruin. - A few miles from here. - What do we achieve by that, huh? If you wanna choose to fight these men, you need some defenses. Otis, try doing the math, huh? Tiên is with the V.C. Otis, that's how they knew about the gold, man. That's how this whole fucking ambush was a setup! Mel? You know Tiên? No, I do not. And you expect him to tell the truth. Okay, look here. Look here, man. Okay. We gonna cut through the jungle to a river. To a village, Hng Ng. Right there, Hng Ng. Wait till nightfall. We gonna rip off a boat, and then we skirt past Tân Châu. - Hey, guys! No! - Tân Châu. We can't go there. That's 20 miles away from here. So what? You scared of a little bit of exercise, fat boy? Huh? David's leg won't handle that. David ain't my problem... anymore. Man, David is your son. My son... is a backstabber. Are you with us or not? My share is my share. You do what you want with his share. Hear me? Listen, you crazy fuck! -Norman wouldn't want us to split up. -That's right. He wouldn't. And that's my problem. Ah. That's my problem, Otis. Stormin' Norm ain't with the living. You feel me? My problem. Peace out! "The Lord is my shepherd! I shall not want! He maketh me lie down in green pastures! He leadeth me beside the still waters! He restoreth my soul! He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for His name's sake! Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me. Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me!" I can help you get it out of the country. -All right. We'll give you a share. -How much is that? Million. We want in, too. - You want in? - Yeah. All right. Damn, Otis. Just put the gold on Craigslist. Mel, what am I supposed to do, huh? Eddie, Simon, that bullshit with Paul and the kidnapping never happened, all right? And what about Seppo? We all know what happened to Seppo. He stepped on a landmine. Hey, so real quick, just for our edification. Our share is also gonna be a million? Shit! Half. They ain't snatching my gold. Not me. No, sir. Not this time. I ain't getting fucked again. Trying to fuck me with salt in the Vaseline.

Not this time. No. Them son of bitches. Son of bitches. Son of... Turned my own son against me. My own blood. God damn. Well... we gonna see who's standing in the end. I don't care what the VA say. VA don't know shit from Shinola. Worst fucking doctors in the world. Malignancy? Shit. You made me malignant. This fucking place here... bathed me in that lymphoma Agent Orange herbicidal stew. Those army bastards, they scorched the earth with it. Sprayed that shit in the air and the water, my bloodstream, my cells, my DNA, and my motherfucking soul! But I ain't dying... from that shit. You will not... kill Paul. You hear me? Hear me. You will not kill Paul. And the US government will not take me out. I will choose when... and how I die. You dig? You couldn't kill me then, with three tours, you sure in the fuck can't kill me now. Right on? Right on. Right on. Right on. -I know that thing is throbbing like hell. -Yeah. Thanks. Don't thank me. Thank your Uncle Meli-Mel. You OGs. Hedy, he's running a fever. I think that wound is infected. Look after him. Get off me! Get off! Get off! What's the issue between you and your father? Jacklyn. Who is she? My mother. My mom... She had a very difficult delivery. And she didn't survive? My apology. I'm intruding. It's none of my business. My father... he loved her more than me. Never let me forget that either. He has hated me since the day I was born. All my fault. I should've died instead of my mother. Goddamn snakebite. Come on. Mother... Fuck you! Fuck! Oof. God, you're a trickster. Oh, God. You're a trickster. Come to Papa. Oh, f-- You got it, Norm. All for you, baby. Life is a bitch! If I gotta go out, I gotta go out like a man, Blood. -Morals and ethics. -Hmm. Sounds like Stormin' Norman. You know, I keep hearing his voice in my head, telling me to do right, just to get it right. Stormin' had this whole living thing figured out. We are not gonna die in Nam. Come on, let's battle, Blood. Bloods. I was asleep. Man, I was fast asleep, knocked out, man. God poked and woke me. I said, "God... God, why you waking my black ass up?" God said to me, "Paul, fuck them motherfuckers. Keep on keeping on." I said to God, "God, do what now?" God raised His voice, didn't yell, but put some bass in that heavenly voice, said to me, "Fuck them motherfuckers, Paul. They don't know shit. Do your thing. Show you're right." What you doing here, bruh? I've been wanting to talk to you. About what? You know. Go away, man. Please? No, no, come on now. Come on now. Come on now. That I can't do, Paul. Gonna have to come clean. Hey, Norm! Norm! Hey. There it is. It was an accident. Ain't no thing, Blood. Accident. I forgive you. You hear that? I forgive you. Ain't no thing, Blood. Come on now. Come on, Paul. Come on, Blood. I forgive you. God is love. Love is God. Come on. Hey, you got me now. You got me good. Ain't no thing. I'm sorr... I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I know you, Blood. I died for you, Blood. Keep digging. You're outnumbered. We're always outnumbered. Where's gold? Stormin' Norman took it, man. It was his. Who's Stormin' Norman? One bad black motherfucker. Where's all the GI? No, I will never tell. See, we're Bloods. We got a bond. We fought... in a immoral war that wasn't ours, for rights... for rights we didn't have. They're my brothers.

Kool and the Gang. After you've been in a war, you understand it really never ends. Whether it's in your mind or in reality. There are just degrees. Tell me about it. If I happen to die, send my share here. One of you two should have this. No. I don't want it. I ain't fired a gun in my life. I shoot, I'd probably miss by a mile, especially with my leg. My father? You seen him? My hunch is Desroche is with him. - Who? - One of your countrymen. He set up our deal, probably gave us the old flimflam. Perhaps I could appeal to him. Worth a try. Are you ready for this? Blood, this ain't my first time in Nam. Well, if we live, you'll teach me that. We're all gonna live. And maybe someday if I come to Paris, you can show me the "Champs-Eleesees." The what? You know, the "Champs-Eleesees"? That big thing y'all got. The Champs-Élysées. - Bet? - Bet. Remember the plan. Yes, sir. Who is your pretty companion? Ah. What'd he just say? That the green is more important than black. He asks for Norman's share. I don't know. Norman is pretty particular about what he shares. -May I ask you a question? -Yes. Was Tiên in on all this? Tiên is a very smart woman, but she doesn't have the appetite for a venture like this. She knows nothing about this. She is as innocent as you are ignorant. Well, take the gold and... leave in peace. Go with God. We just want what we came for. Good. You bastards! Go, go, go! - I can't feel a thing. - Fuck. Straight through. Through and through. - You'll survive, buddy. - Be safe. Grenade! No! Your Bloods are all dead. There is no one left. Where is the gold? Five Bloods don't die, we multiply. Allow me. Madness! Madness! Godfather, you'll be all right. Dear David. Son... if you're reading this, you know I've met my maker. I gave this letter to... my main man, your godfather, Otis, when we landed back in Nam. I came back to confront the demons that haunted me and tortured you. I made you feel like you weren't loved. Our brother Stormin' Norman always commanded us Bloods, love one another. In that way, I failed you, man. All I can say to you is... I'm sorry I put you through holy hell. Believe me... This just came. ...it wasn't your fault. There are things about me that you will never know or understand, David. I wish I could turn back the hands of time... I can't. Nobody can. - Mic check! - Mic check! - Mic check! - Mic check! I got something I gotta share with y'all. We just received a check from our soldier Eddie for two million dollars! - Mic check! - Mic check! - Mic check! - Mic check! When I say "black lives," y'all say "matter!" - Black lives! - Matter! - Black lives! - Matter! - Black lives matter! - Black lives matter! Black lives matter! Black lives matter! Black lives matter! Black lives matter! Thank you. Thank you, everyone being here on this sad but beautiful day. And I'm happy to tell you that this three million dollar gift is donated in the name of my late colleague, Seppo Havelin, and will work toward removing mines and bombs, and also restoring the lives of victims all over the world. Left. Left. Left. Left. Left. But to eternity and back, your dear mother, Jackie, and I... will love you always. You best believe I will love you always, son. Your father. Your dad. Otis. I couldn't go back home without seeing you both before I left. I miss you. And I love you so...

We were convinced that we could not limit our vision to certain rights for black people... but instead affirmed the conviction that America would never be free or saved from itself until the descendants of its slaves were loosed completely from the shackles they still wear. In a way, we were agreeing with Langston Hughes, that black bard of Harlem, who had written earlier, "O, yes I say it plain America never was America to me And yet I swear this oath America will be!" Be safe. Shit! Cut!
