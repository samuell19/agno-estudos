Wait a minute. She is coming, she is coming. All Rosa newspapers. The editor of the newspaper is here with the photographer. Rosa, voc follows. It's time. Rosa, you don't have to do this if you don't want to. I know. We believe in you. You can do it. Rosa, why did you do that? Refused to give the place. THE HISTORY OF ROSA PARKS Go around the block. Mrs. Parker, smile. Right. It's all right. Sra. Parks. Sra. Parks. Rolly, Rolly, voc� est� errado. Many girls here. I wanted to study here. Rosa. Rosa, we have to come in dear. Be careful not to step on McCauley. Rosa, make sure you behave yourself. As I said. Yes ma'am. Mrs. White's school costs money. Yes ma'am. Just talk if they talk to you. If the teacher asks questions and you know the answer, answer. Don't be ashamed. Everyone will know that you are very smart, my baby. Yes ma'am. Come on, they're waiting for you. Good morning Mrs. White Good morning, girls. We have a new student today. Rosa McCauley. You can sit back there. You'll be fine. Thank you, Mrs. White. Everyone looking ahead please. Thank you. Where are you from? Pine Level. I've heard of it. I don't know where it is. But I've heard of it. I will present myself. Call me Johnnie. What do you think of Mrs. White's school so far? It is not so different from the others. But this is the first time, inside a classroom, with glass tables and windows, never seen chocolate before or had a white teacher? How do you know all this? Only girls from the country eat tomatoes for lunch. Please bring your exams. Rowena, did you fail the test? I'm never doing well, Mrs. Barton, I'm really stupid. Rowena, voc� n�o � burra. I don't know why we care about reading and arithmetic. At the end we will wash and clean babies' noses. Does anyone want to answer Rowena's question? Rosa, why do we care? We bother to be equal to everyone. We are not equal to everyone. We are not like whites. I was raised in a way that if I want something, I can do what I want. No one is better than me, man, woman, black or white. If any white man says ... Ningu�m. You can take anything from me but not my dignity. No one can take this away from you. It was what my grandfather said and I believe him. If you don’t learn anything here, may the Lord help you to remember what Rosa taught you. Am�m... Don't talk nonsense. Will keep looking for a man ... but Rosa is not going anywhere. It's all right. Amooo you. Pink ... Pink. Or, yes, madam. How is your mother? She's fine. I will visit you at any time. Yes ma'am. Bye Bye. We wear the mask that smiles and lies. Hides our cheeks and protects our eyes. This debt we pay to the deceitful human. With torn and bleeding hearts, we smile. Parks, don't make me get up and take this blade from your hands. What? These are the words of Paul Laurence Dunbar. Who? A great black poet. It wasn't the one who ... ... a bastard. Oh my God. It will take time to free the Scottsboro boys. At least they're not on death row. The newspapers started talking about it. N�o � a NAACP John... NAACP are a bunch of fearful old people who do nothing. It will cost a lot to help the boys. A lot of money. I'm expecting a group from Montgomery, raising money. It's very dangerous, Parks. Can be. What are you doing now? Fox trying to steal those students again. Who's in the purple sweater? I've never seen her before. Maybe she is new. From where I am brother, it looks better than new. I know I know... Hello girls? Ol� Parks. They don't have to stay in the rain. It's all right. It would be sad to see this wet sweater. just water, it will dry. With this bright smile, I'm sure you will. There are newspapers here. Take as much as you need. Black newspapers are hard to find, but not here. - Isn't it cute? - Who? Parks, garota, Raymond Parks. Or Chicago defender. It's too white for my taste. But it's perfect for me. They said something about the Scottsboro boys, raise money. S�rio? Life is about facing danger my friends, about risks. Having to fight for what's right, even if we risk our lives. As I see it, all black people in this city, should support the Scottsboro boys They need money for the defense fund. And I have the address here, to make your contribution. It's the owner of the place, let's go. Maybe we should go, we shouldn't be here. We are ... We do not use mask. Hides our cheeks and protects our eyes. Underneath our feet is the mile long. But let the world dream differently. We do not use mask! Paul Laurence Dunbar. I better go home. See you tomorrow. Wait Rosa. Wait Rosa. Hi. I'm Raymond Parks. Everyone calls me Parks. I would like you too. I ... I have to go. What's your name? It's getting wet. Better hurry up and say your name, before I go. I really have to go home. They said I fell in love with the girl, who was kind and made me lose my mind. And I almost lost my mind. Way. Parks, I'm going to be late for work. What's her name? Fanny, what's her name? Why should I say? Of course it should. Or it wouldn't be darling Fanny. Rosa. My cousin's name is Rosa Louise McCauley. Thank you Fanny. Tell your cousin I will see her. I paid to shave, man. You paid for the first date ... with Rosa Louise McCauley. Scottsboro, Tennessee trial. Yup. Very close to the border. A lot of people are angry about that. Of course they are, brother. Everyone knows that boys don't ... raped the girls on the train. They are commenting that the NAACP is coming from New York. They will get even worse. They were sentenced to death, mother. How much worse can it get? Who is this? Hum? Who is this? Nobody we know has a car. Not just a car. It's a Studebaker. A rare Studebaker with a rascal inside. Hey dude. How are you? All right? A real Studebaker. Oh, mother? - Pink? - To him. - He who? - The barber, mother. Parks, Raymond Parks. I think it's his name. - How did you meet a barber? - I didn't know ... Motion sensor cameras. Come on, turn it on. I can't see. Mother, go there and say that I will leave. Hey Sylvester, how are you? All right? I'm looking for Rosa. Is she at home? Rosa? She's not, but I say she came here. - It's all right. Give it to her. - Right. I still want to learn to drive. - Tell her well about me? - Leave it to me. Rosa, that man again. - Hey man, how are you? - I am fine. - Your sister is ... - She can't come here now. - I'll tell her she came here. - Yes, I know you will. Him again? Rosa! I'm losing patience with you. I don't know why he always comes back. Come on, Mr. Parks. What did he say mom? He said... I'm glad Palma Holandês grows all year round. Come on, I want to show you something. If I had known, I would have come with my swimsuit. It is not a good place to swim. But great for fishing. My grandfather taught me how to fish. Always in summer. Even after all these years. He was born nearby. He spent half his life as a slave. - Did he talk about it? - Not for me. I prepared the hook for him. When his vision got worse. We sat for hours. We talked about anything. Sometimes we didn't say anything. Mom liked to tease. She said she learned to fish even before walking. I don't know about it but he sure did. Did you fish a lot? N�o. Did your father never teach you? My father never taught me anything. Except different ways to hate him. - I'm sorry, I didn't want to ... - No, it's okay. Dad was a coal miner. He was white, enough to pass for one, mostly. The problem was the times that I couldn't get through ... Anyway... ... used it on my mother and me. When we left, it was an immense joy. We heard that he died falling from a roof. It seemed that the joy was even greater. Will you be my greatest joy? - Ah. - It's a pol cia. It was all I needed. Maldi��o! Don't worry, everything will be fine. - Whose car is this? - My. You wouldn't lie to me, would you? I can confirm that the car is his. S�rio? - I have the documents right here. - Not a lot, kid. Calling all vehicles. All vehicles. Get your ass off the road. You did the right thing, Parks. I didn't do anything. Sometimes this is the right thing. Sometimes not . I know that too. It is likely that they will lynch these boys. A colored group was protesting in front of Scottsboro Court, but ... Are you ready? TWO BLACKS FOUND DEAD. BELIEVE THAT THEY WORKED ... IN THE DEFENSE OF SCOTTSBORO BOYS. - Barber shop. - Mr. Jetter? - Sim. - � Rosa McCauley. - Hi Rosa. - I'm looking for Parks. - Parks? - Is he there? Has anyone seen Parks? Not since he went to Scottsboro. I said not to go alone with all those people, but ... know with him . Keep talking ... - Thanks. - Pink? A MAN WAS LINCHED TODAY Next week I will teach how to ... Come on. Have some water. WHITE ONLY Brother, do you think their water is sweeter? There is only one way to know. If they do, we'll be in trouble. Not if I change the plates. Do not put your mouth in this water. I think it's worse, it tastes like rust. Get away. Everyone out, don't you hear? I would like to tell him. Sylvester, don't say anything. Won't we change the plates? Rosa? Help us, Lord, to understand, how weak we are. How irresponsible we are ... Mam�e... In the disease ... Help us understand ... How do you ...? I thought you were dead. I know. I'm so sorry. How do you ...? Your car is not outside. Where is your car? I'm fine. What happened to your face? I sold the car. Why? As long as I have you, I don't need anything else. May God bless you and keep you. And I declare them husband and wife. Mr. Parks, you can kiss the bride, Mrs. Parks. Kiss. Thank you very much. Kiss, kiss. Here it comes, it takes time. Lets go in. Hey? What do you think you're doing? I said, what do you think you're doing? I'm going to Cleveland Avenue. If you go on this bus, will go down and enter from behind. Why leave? I'm already here, and it's raining. I don't care if the world is ending. If you go on my bus, will leave and enter from behind. Did you hear me? Don't touch me. It's all right. Come on. Come on. He doesn't feel close to her. Get off the bus. Maybe, you can get out of this. It is a letter of conscription. No one manages to escape. There must be someone we can write to. And say what? I think it's a big mistake, Mr. Roosevelt. Mom thinks I shouldn't fight other people's war. What's the matter with that? It's the truth. Oh Raymond. Instead of creating a safe world for democracy, this country tries to create safe Alabama for the Blacks. Well, that's true. Ai est Rosa. My God. What happened? Rosa? - I ... I came home. - It is more than 8 kilometers. - Missed the bus dear? - No. - What happened? - I was thrown out. - Off the bus? Why? - What difference does it make? I'll make a coffee. Take off your wet clothes. My God, it's soaked. - Did he put his hands on you? - No. But he wanted to. Why did they throw you off the bus? Because I didn't want to pay to leave ... and enter through the back door. Sure. Come on dear, deite-se, deite-se. It has been that way for a long time. - How is this right? - I didn't say it's right. Said it was always like that. The last time I checked, the money I paid for the bus, It is the same color that white people use. We pay to be humiliated. This does not make sense. Since when does anything make sense? I say one thing, never again I'll forget the driver's face. Pink? Didn't you study with Johnnie? She's in the newspaper. Pink? Rosa, haven't you studied with a girl named Johnnie? When are you going to stop this voting process? After the Devrel B campaign. Can we help you? Sorry to interrupt. I'm here to see someone. Rosa? Or Johnnie. So good to see you. What are you doing here? Well, I saw your picture in the newspaper. I'm sorry. Excuse. We'll talk later. No, come on. No, no, no. Stay here. This is important. To my best friend, guys. Could you give the chair, please? You're right here. - Excuse me. - Sit here. Wait a minute. Are you a member? Member? NAACP? us. The people you just interrupted. - Well, you know ... - No. Stay here. Well, you're here through an exceptional member. Dusa collects fees at the end of the month. Let's make a new membership. It will be an even better member, if you know how to make good notes. I think I can do it. The loud one over there is Ed Nixon, the President. It is a Pullman Porter normally. It is noisy but harmless. - We have a big campaign ... - Do you need a ride? No, no, let's have lunch. Take my friend to lunch. Oh, excuse me. Mr. Nixon? I don't mind being a secretary, but I hope you don’t think that’s all I can do. What else can you do? Well, tell me what you need, and say if I can. The same Rose as always. There is this group called the Youth Council. School-age children who need information, counseling. Biblical Studies, self-esteem. I Love... Wait a minute. We also need a little enthusiasm. A spirit of protest. Something many don't have at home. She can do it, Mr. Nixon. You found the right person. She can do that. Alright then. Thank you. Have a nice day. So, what have you been doing out there? I work as a seamstress in a department store in Montgomery. - Alterations, dresses. - Isn't it your face? N�o. We hope, in the Lord and in ideas ... of how we spend our time. - Would you like something to drink? - Hey ... Wait ... No. You came so far for me, and I still put you to work. The least I can do is buy a soda for you. Let me see here ... it's my voting card. I always wanted to vote for Mr. Roosevelt. S�rio? His wife Eleanor made it possible for Marian Anderson ... sing on the stairs of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC - Are you registered? - Not yet. Don't tell Mr. Nixon. Give a moral lesson. Blacks who don't vote, deserve the treatment they get. Here's your soda. Call me Johnnie. Since you're new, you don't have friends, I will be your best friend. Mrs. White, Mrs. Barton and all the teachers are from the North. - They seem to be strict. - They are. It's something called Quaker. It is a religion that believes that everyone is equal, - that must be treated equally. - It is a good religion. My mother thinks Mrs. White is holy. For what you did to keep the school open. Like what? Many don't want to teach girls of color. Even important people tried to stop it. But every time, Mrs. White and other teachers, they rose and continued to teach. - Secret ria? - Aham. The meeting is held once a month. Secretaries do much more than just go to meetings. I'm just a volunteer, I do as much and whenever I want. This is scary. You will do everything you ask and more. Are you afraid you won't be home often? Fear that it won't run fast enough. And never be home again. You know the police watch these meetings, Rosa. I don't need to tell you what can happen. I will not be one of the leaders, Parks. Do you think you won't be screwed if you are just a secretary? I want to do that. You don't need my permission. I didn't ask for your permission, but your approval would be good. Do you want my approval? Risking your neck with a bunch of cowards at NAACP. - I can't do that. - That's all we have. And ... Scottsboro was 10 years ago. That, 10 years and these boys are still in prison. 10 years with the Almighty National Association ... of blacks holding their hands like a bunch of old men ... screaming justice with a whisper. Jews and Communists did more to help those boys now they're dead. You will do what you want. Est for sale ... Uhhhh, torta de ma a tamb . Aham. - The path to the heart. - Your heart I already have. - It's the mind I want. - Yup. Parks? I need you to understand that for the first time ... I feel I can help. Maybe do something important for our people. I understand this passion Rosa, I was there, remember? - I know. So ... - I'm afraid of this passion too. Fear of everything that could happen. If I promise that I will be very, very careful? But you can't. Are you new? It cannot be careful and effective. You niggas tempted ... for 300 years. "Although we don't stand up and give it to you because it's your friend". "Because of your persistence". "He will get up and give you as many as he needs". Sure. Who knows what persistence means? Sim. A MAN WAS LINCHED TODAY VOTER REGISTRATION Hello. I came to register. - Do you live in Montgomery? - Yes. How many states are there? 48.

What else can we do? First, a black soldier shot on the bus, now this. We have to force the city to treat black people like human beings. Good afternoon. I'm Rosa Parks. Oh, I'm sorry, uhh Clifford, Virginia. Rosa Parks. - Pleasure. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, Rosa. - And you. Jo Ann Robinson, women's policy advisor. Pleasure. Mr. Nixon, call tomorrow if you change your mind. Very good. - Good evening everyone. - Good night. - What happened? - A black woman was arrested on the bus. - Claudete Colvin? - For not giving way to a white. We need to find someone who motivates people. - Like a revival and all. - Claudete is a child. Claudete is not that person. No. - Well, I'm going home. - You can give me a ride. - Good night. - Oh, Rosa? - Yes. - Don't stay too late. - I don't want your husband mad at me. - Parks knows I like the job. God knows that a woman, you don't need to be anywhere but at home and in the kitchen. So I can't type all your letters in this mess or ... organizing your lecture schedule or answer your letters, without salary. Well I needed a secretary, - and you're very good. - Thanks. - Good night. - Good night. Jo Ann, are you coming with me? Give me the bus cases. They are always buses. - Hello, can I help you? - I'm looking for Mr. Nixon. Oh, I'm sorry but he's gone. Something I can do for you? My boy, Elijah. He need help. Okay, okay. Calm down... They knew what he did. Happening since summer. Since when I started living with Sarah's relatives. Mrs. since we were kids we played together. So, you were inside her house? Yes ma'am. Nable, peering out the back window. Sarah said I broke down the door, and I went after her. I didn't do what Ms. Parks says. I believe in you Elijah. I believe in you. - I'm going to the electric chair. - No. Not if we can help. But it can't help. No one can. You have to have Elijah. I have already lost hope Madam. The police all the time saying ... who are going to watch me fry. Saying things like ... You'll fry black. That boy didn't rape that white girl. Maybe not, but going to prison didn't help him. Someone had to do something. And what do you do there, besides giving you false hopes? Not even that can give. I never felt so useless. The cemeteries are full of innocent black boys, Rosa. There are also innocent black girls, men and women. I have never sat in front of others or seen the fear of the desperate. - I don't know them. - You don't know this either. Rosa, this boy was caught in bed with a white girl. Your mother has to thank the police who got him before Klan. Is it better to fry than to be lynched? - You know what I mean. - What if it was our son, Parks? How grateful are we then? If it were my son, what happened between him and the girl, - it never would have happened. - You don't know that Parks. Oh, I know. Because I would make sure you know how the South works. Remember if... Whatever happens, don't be angry or stupid. Just do what we came to do. Would you like me to sign my book, please? The procedure that v for black agency ... in your neighborhood. Sign your book there. I went but they didn't have what I need. Hardly as much as I need. It may be, but you cannot sign your book here. Why not? Others signed the books. You must place the order at your own agency, to have the book sent to you. It takes a long time. When I send it, I won't need it anymore. I can't do anything. Your procedure is unfair ... and insulting to anyone who knows right and wrong. Would you like me to sign my book, please? Thank you Jesus. All right? tonight. I know. They're going to kill my boy, Mrs. Parks. The Lord... My Pastor ... A MAN WAS LINCHED TODAY What will you wear this Christmas? School shoes test. Merry Christmas to all. I usually shop in New York, or Atlanta. I come here because of you, Rosa. You are the best in town. Thank you, Mrs. Winner. I like my job. Rosa, can you come early tomorrow? Natal is very busy. Yes, Mr. Bradley. I can count on an extra. - Great. Could it be 8am? - Yes. Is the size of your shoe on this piece of paper? I want to try shoes too. I want to try on shoes. Mam�e... Can I help you? She will win shoes today. Why not measure directly from the foot? Never had new shoes before? Blacks cannot try shoes in the store. Right. I'll see what I can do for you. Could they release the front seats? I'll stand on the stairs until they leave the place. Are you going out? N�o. If I don't leave, I'll have you arrested. Do it. Jesus. Driver James Blake. I have a black woman on my bus, in violation of the law. Did you warn her James? - Yes, sir, I warned you. - Then make the arrest. You have to exercise your power and get her off the bus. All right then. Just get off the bus. What are you trying to prove? - Grandma, I think I hate whites. - You need to remember something. He is as capable as anyone. White, black, or green with stripes. Never be afraid of what might happen to you, if you fight for what is right. As long as you remember that, you don't have to worry about others. Come on him. She is sitting in the black section. I needed this place and she didn't want to leave. I want you arrested. Why didn't you get up? Why do we bother so much? Will you hear this? The Law is the law. Miss, you're under arrest. Would you like to make a phone call, please? Remove your glasses. Look forward. Rosa Parks, come with me. I need to use the phone. Did you just leave the Church? Hello. Good night. You are listening to WCO, this is a number 1 Gospel. - Sra. Leona. - Sr. Nixon. - How are you ma'am? - Just in time for the Christmas cookie. - No, I can't. Thank you. A coffee? N�o, n�o, s�rio. Rosa was arrested. - No. - It's gonna be okay. Calm calm. - What happened? - Everyone is commenting. - Rosa was arrested, she's in jail. - Did they hit her? - We don't know anything yet. - Oh, no. Parks? Montgomery Police. Call the sergeant. Get her out of there. Yes. Here is Ed Nixon, President Montgomery of NAACP. They arrested one of our members ... Son of a bitch. Al�. Sim, Sr. Nixon. Clifford. And Mr. Nixon. The police arrested Rosa Parks and do not want to give information. What happened? When? Okay, I'll try. I'm already going. Here is Clifford Dare, lawyer Clifford Dare, Sergeant. We pray that God will comfort us. Am m. Okay ladies, let's stop this. Rosa Parks? Come on. Everything will be fine. - Oh, Rosa ... - Everything will be fine. Thank you, Mr. Clifford. Everything will be fine. Don't worry. The deal is as follows, we have to find a way to pay. Rosa will not return to prison. - When is the hearing? - Monday. Don't worry, in no way Rosa goes back to prison. She shouldn't be there in the first place. - Parks? - I'm sorry Rosa, But I won't hide how I feel. You and your group are responsible for Rosa's arrest. - Al? - Mrs. Leona, this is Johnnie. Rosa's arrest angered all blacks in Montgomery. Remember Jo Ann Robinson. The students made posters. They want to boycott the buses. - Yes, Johnnie? - They organized a meeting. - Yup. - With the new Minister. - When? - Tomorrow at Dexton Avenue Church. Sure. There will be a meeting early tomorrow at Dexton Avenue Church. - For what? - About what you did on the bus. All ministers, had the phones ringing all over the city. They want you at the meeting, and if you can't go, you'll understand. Dexter Avenue Church? The one with the new Minister? This is it. I better go. Mr. Parks, if you think we put Rosa to do that, he doesn't know his wife very well. One thing ... She is the one who is leading us. Raymond? I'll get something to eat. You must be starving. You can't really believe I was asked to do this. My wife was in prison. I didn't ask to be arrested, Parks. All I wanted was what everyone on that bus wanted ... go home. And I don't need Nixon, NAACP or anyone else to tell me ... that I have the right to my dignity ... when I pay 10 cents for the bus. I want to know what we're going to do about this prison. Well, we need to get ... This is what we're going to do. Let's stop using the bus. If they don't treat us with respect, they don't deserve our money. Stop using the bus? Like this? That's right. For a whole day. It's the moment everyone has been waiting for. Rosa Parks is a great citizen. We have to demonstrate. I say we're going to stop using the bus on Monday. The day of Rosa's hearing. We don't have time for that ... Montgomery and most black citizens have to join the rings. That's right. Let's press where it gives more. In money. Boycott is illegal. In the name of the protest. How are you? Everyone knew there would be some retaliation. Let's start by sending letters. To send letters? We're talking about a day without a bus ... One day is all they need to put us back in place. Our place is not to wait for them for what I need. I say that even the dogs are tired of this clowning. Mrs. Parks, it gave us courage, a golden opportunity. Shall we be cowards and miss this chance? N�o. Don't talk to me like that, I'm a man. - So act like one. - I'm acting. Let the Reverend speak. Let the Reverend speak. For the protest against buses to work we have to be united. - Division is on the way to failure. - This is what we're doing now. The charge was disorderly conduct. Do you think it will be a problem? Mrs. Parks is not messy. He did not resist or disrespect the police officer. There is a law that says that a black man does not need to give the place ... for a white if they're sitting in the black section ... - there are no more empty seats. - I didn't know that. You and all the blacks in Montgomery. The point is that buses are full of laws only for you. You can stop there. Look at the bus stop. Hi how are you? You don't expect everyone ... Many live far away. Are you going to get on the bus or not? I don't go in until James Blake leaves. Beautiful thing man. It will be a good day. It proves that teamwork works. Do you swear to tell the truth, only the truth with God's help? Sim. Mrs. Wycliffe, where you were at 7pm ... on the afternoon of December 1, 1955? I was on the bus, near Court Square, at the bus stop. And did you see the arrest of the woman named Parks? Clearly how I see it now. At the time of the discussion with driver Mr. Blake, was there an empty seat in the black section on the bus? There were many empty seats. This is a lie Sil ncio, please. Ei Parks, est pronto? - Oh Mrs. Leona, beautiful tree. - Rosa who did it. Oh Rosa, they are very happy. Are you not? - Go where? - Dexter Street Church, at the meeting. - About what? - The protest. I think they will continue and want to know if you will. Why do they need Rosa? It would be better if she was there. Good for whom? Well, if you're going to hurry. Half of the blacks in Montgomery are talking about this meeting. It is an important meeting. Come with me, Mrs. Leona. I'm saying. now ... Very important meeting. Come on Rosa. - Parks? - Is Rosa using you, n ov? Yes, I know and I don't care. But I care I care that you use my wife, you are not Harriet Tubman. No. I'm Rosa Parks, and I am your wife. If you don't want me to come to this meeting, I won't. Voc or. Do what you want. Here, Mrs. Parks. Ladies and gentlemen, the hero of the moment, Mrs. Rosa Parks. These days, Thursday passed to be exact. One of the most exemplary citizens of Montgomery. Not just an exemplary black citizen, mas de Montgomery. She was taken off the bus and taken to prison, and arrested because she refused to give the place to a white person. How it happened. I'm glad it happened to someone like Ms. Rosa Parks. No one can doubt the unlimited reach of your integrity. Good character or Christian commitment to the teaching of Jesus. Let's work with determination ... to have justice in this city. And we are not wrong. If we are wrong, the Supreme Court of this nation is not wrong. If we are wrong, the constitution of the United States is wrong. If we are wrong, Almighty God is wrong. If we are wrong, the justice is a lie. And we are determined here in Montgomery ... To work and fight until the justice rolls down like water ... - Pink? - Yes, Mr. Bradley. His position was eliminated Rosa. I'm sorry. - Movement is weak ... - Weak? It is the busiest period of the year. Not if your boycott continues. Last week's payment. L�, � Rosa Parks. Play at the door, play, play. - It's me, it's me. - Damn. I saw a lot of people so I decided to go in the back. It's okay, okay. Where is mommy? Reverend and Mr. Davis will look after her tonight. We're on the side of the house for security, Rosa. We can't take it anymore. You should call the police when they come like that. For what? They never do anything. Half of these masked people are in the police. I should still call for registration. Legally, they can help us. Why are you so late? I was looking for work. Have you lost your job? He said the movement is weak and he had to dismiss me. It will work, I will find something. - With your job ... - My job? You mean, the job I had. What happened? Let's say that my wife is not a secret. Al�? N�o, n�o, n�o. Come here. There are some new ones there. What time does the bus come? Look at the clock and choose a number. It's as good as the schedule. If you don't want to wait, you can take the city bus. I will stay with Durain. Maybe I will do that. One of my customers at the Mrs. Rymer store, I said I might have more work when we're done. Well, blessed be Mrs. Rymer. And Mr. Rymer also for not caring. - Parks at home? - I haven't seen it since early. - That that dear. - I'm losing him, mom. Not Rosa, Raymond loves you. I know he does. That's why I see him like this. Things are hard for everyone these days, Rosa. But it's my fault. It's not your fault. � sim. It was me sitting on that bus. It was me that driver had to deal with. And he coped, so what? Here we are. Are you trying to tell me you're back? Sim. N�o. I don't know. You know. You know. Even knowing what you know now, you would do exactly the same. Why you can't stand it. I would do it because who you are Rosa. Thanks God. Thank God Rosa, for whom you are. I love you wanted. This protest is not helping at all. People think that something is going to change. Nothing is going to change. Mr. Charlie here is not better than it was before, when those women created this mess. Someone had to do something. Well, I'm tired of it. I'm tired too. See? It's not just me. Because these feet, long ago, they walked many kilometers and saw a lot of red sand, that voc never seen. Yes, but I've walked enough. My soul is tired son, tired of being treated ... as less than a man. Yes, I know what you mean. You don't know what I mean boy. And you don't know what that girl was saying on that bus. But I know what he was saying. I will keep walking for as long as I have to walk. Because the feet may be tired, but my soul is rested. Hey, let me help you with this. - Thanks son. - It's all right. - When did you get home? - Just arrived. What are you doing? Reminding me how lucky I am. I remember when I started courting you. You didn't come to the door. There was something about you that kept me coming back. I knew on the first day. Outside the barbershop. If I knew at that time, that would turn this city around, maybe the whole south upside down. Would you keep coming back? I don't know. What you did on that bus changed a lot, Rosa. It made many people think of themselves. How to treat people. How to live your life. - It wasn't supposed to change us. - I know. But it has changed. Even though it took a while to see. It was a good change. I didn't really do anything, Parks. All this because of me and that bus. THE LONG AND HAPPY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RAYMOND PARKS, CONTINUED UNTIL HIS DEATH IN 1977. For many of us, alive today. In a very real sense, this journey began 43 years ago. When a woman named Rosa Parks sat on a bus in Alabama ... and didn't get up. She's sitting with the first lady tonight, and she can get up, or not, as she prefers. Tradu��o, Sincronia, Revis�o: Andr� Kauffman Revis o: Weight
