Nastya! Not the porcelain! Why the checks, my love! Not our check! Bastard! Not our check! With my sister! With my sister on our wedding day! Nastya, calm down. We've been married 20 minutes... And I already want to be a widow. Okay, my love. Let the honeymoon begin! A toast to the bride and groom! Let's wish them many happy years together. The party goes on! Come with me, Sir. Mom, the groom is going to do something to the bride. He's allowed. Now she's his wife. No, there was screaming and they threw things. - It's what you do after you get married. - Mom, you have to help the bride! It's not polite to intervene between a husband and wife. - Now come on. - I don't know the steps. There's nothing to know. You just dance. Keep smiling, girls. I'll be right back. And now, for something a bit more romantic. Will you let me dance with my wife? Go check the batteries. And don't walk around with your camera. You're annoying my customers. I almost forgot you were here today. I noticed. You dance like a circus bear, Daddy. You dance like a dismissal notice. - Come on, just till the song is over. - Your boss is watching. Oh, one more minute. How often does the whole family spend an evening together? Come on. We're not here to fool around. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me, miss. Excuse me, Bride! Drop dead, you bastard! Let me be! I want to die! Miss, come back! Please, it's dangerous! Help! The bride is drowning! Nastya! Nastya, come back! Somebody help! Nastya, don't do it! Don't do it, Nastya! Hey girls! If you give me a kiss, I'll give you 50 shekels! If you give me a kiss, I'll give you 50 shekels! If you give me a kiss, I'll give you 50 shekels! Go away, you don't even have one shekel! I have a million! My dad just got back from the casino. That's enough, go home. Kiss my ass! Chen... if you give me a kiss, I'll give you 50 shekels. Okay. I'm late. I'll give you one later. Chen! Tell your mom if she gives me a kiss, I'll give her 50 shekels. This isn't out of the blue. I just heard there's a place where they teach you the salsa here in town. Really? Where do they teach laundry and how to make schnitzel? I'll clean up when we return. I asked for a free night so we could go salsa. What salsa? It's for people looking to get laid. - Let them look. Who cares? - You're a big girl. Do as you please. - Hey, man. - Hi, Dad. How is Judo? You learning to kick ass? - Yeah - Great. This neighborhood is a big Mafia. Don't forget we're going to the sand dunes, tomorrow. He forgot. Again. Our twelfth anniversary, and not even a flower. And there's no chance for an invitation to the movies or the theater. What an idiot your Mom is. Found herself just the right guy to ask out to go dancing. If you ask me, I'll come with you. Don't they teach the steps there? Very funny. I'm serious. Come on. I hate it when you're sad. You act so... I can't. I have to clean up. Dad will get angry. We'll clean up quickly when we get back. So come on. Oh, gosh... - Just look, I'm such a mess. - You look fine. Come on. Won't you be embarrassed to be seen with me? What a shitty town. Ashdod isn't shitty. Don't say shitty, young man. It's not polite. Ashdod is rated as one of the best cities in all Israel. - Says who? - Our geography teacher. I'll bet that the geography teacher can afford to live up north. Let's walk. Santa's sled will go by before the bus comes. Soon, you'll be out dancing with girls your own age. You know, I've never seen you talk to a girl. What would I talk to them about? You're right, for now, you're all mine. Go on. Drive right by. Who needs you? - May I have this dance? - That's the teacher. May I have this dance, Madam? I think he wants to dance with me. I'll be back in a minute. Natalie, you know the rules. We said nine. It's now nine twenty. Good foot work. We'll work on your shoulders tomorrow. Good night. - Can I help you? - No. I'm just waiting. - For whom? - For my mom to finish dancing. - What are you filming? - Me? Just stuff. - Are you making a movie? - I guess you could call it a documentary. What's it about? I don't know yet. I see. Your mom's going to be here for a while. Call your dad to come pick you up. - No thank you, madam. I'll wait. - As you wish, sir. Chen! Hurry up! The light's going down. Don't we take pictures of scenery? Tourists take pictures of scenery, kid. We are photographers. We're interested in wandering sands... or "sand migration", as they call it. Today, the dunes are here, shaped like this. Tomorrow, the wind will come and blow them all away. Isn't that the most beautiful thing you've ever seen? Almost. Despite the marks those assholes with 4x4s make with their wheels... it's still the most beautiful sight. But how many times can you explain that to a snobby curator... from the "De la Fart" Gallery! Spray it! Now you tell me, Chenovsky... your mom said you went to the community center with her last night. What? You suddenly felt like salsa? Me? Daddy's little boy. And your mom? Did she drink anything? Dance on tables? No. The teacher just showed her the steps. Did you have your camera, by any chance? Catch anything on tape? I did have my camera, but nothing interesting happened. You know, when I'm not around, you're the man around the house. And you know your mom. If you don't watch over her, she can get in trouble. So will you help me watch over your mom? Yes. Look at me. Now quiet. Don't breathe. Excuse me, madam. Can you close the door? Anna, when you look at the floor... does it say, "I'm crooked?" Madam Esti, a partner is not a cane. You don't have to lean on him. How tall are you? I don't know. One meter and a candy bar. Want to dance? No, I don't know the steps. Just follow me. Hold your head up and straighten your knees. Stand straight. Open up. Release, don't resist. No violence, please. Sharon, if he doesn't improve, send him back where you found him. Cha-cha-cha, two, three. Cha-cha-cha, two, three. Next class at the same time, on Wednesday. If you're interested. - Okay. - You decide what your movie's about, yet? Me? Well, you could say it's about your class. I mean, if you give your permission. Please. - Roman! - Yes, my sweet. Could you leave the poor girl alone a minute and throw me a cassette? I could, but you see, I'm working. Come on, Vicky! Here you go. We already have a movie. Make a nice film about judo, okay? - But, what if I only film when... - I have work to do. Good bye. Thank you, madam. You are welcome, sir. Do you want to waltz? Hold your hands just like this. And start dancing. One, two, three... One, two, three. Low, high, high... Low, high, high... Beautiful. We are Roman and Yulia Rabinovich. This cassette will open up the world of ballroom dancing to you. That's it. I knew you looked familiar, man. I see you went for size this time. Chen, get some soft-light gelatin from up there. I'm just kidding, sweetheart. His taste improves with time. Next time, it will probably be even better. Great! Hold that chin up! Chen, what's with the gelatin? Let's change positions. Act as if you're dancing. - What's your name, sweetheart? - Ruslana. Does your mother know? Haven't you heard that Russian women and Israeli men... are two parallel lines that never meet? Smile! Beautiful! You look very happy. Chen, can I get that gelatin this week? - You dance very well. - Thank you. Do you want to be a dancer when you grow up? A dancer, a model, an actress, and a veterinarian. But now, I'm focusing on dance, because of the competition. - Are you participating? - Me? In what? In the National Championship. They'll be there from the television. And whoever wins first place will go to a contest abroad. - Were you ever abroad? - Me? Well, I was... - No. - Were you ever in Tel Aviv? When I was little. I don't really remember. Were you ever on TV? No, unfortunately. - Yes, how can we help you? - I want a facial piercing, please. - In my nose, or eyebrows, or lips. - Take your girlfriend home, okay? Why home? So she'll give 20 shekels to some bum in the neighborhood... gets an infection which gets to her blood stream. - And then rest in peace, poor soul? - Enough bullshit from you. You'd better watch out! Come on, already. And bring some cigarettes when you come back, bitch. What'll it be, man? Hello? I asked you, what do you want? Don't take it off for two weeks... otherwise your ear will get an infection and rot away... - get it? - Yes. Good, thirty shekels. Excuse me, but aren't you the lady from the famous duo... - Rabinovich, Roman, and... - Yulia. Wow, I can't believe it. What an honor. My mother is your number one fan. This must be an imposition, but could you please... - For my mother. - Gladly. What's her name, please? Novogrodesky Sophia Pavlovna. Just two weeks ago, out of the blue, she mentioned you. "Where did they disappear to?" She asked me. And here you are! In our own little Ashdod! If you could perhaps perform in Mom's senior citizens' home... - it would be a dream come true. - We stopped performing six years ago. Of course, family life, kids... Good day. Yes, I see. Goodbye. I don't understand. Is it an ear inflammation? - Is an inflammation an infection? - Yes. - Then I need medicine for infection. - So you do have an inflammation? No, it's for you know, to take out the earring. Get a move on, man. It's not Russia where you wait in line for a year! - Yes, please. This isn't a playground. - Dima, I'll take care of him. Do you have a name? - Chen. - So please tell me, Chen... why did you get your ears pierced, if you take the earring out right away? I had no choice. I mean, I did, but... Excuse me, madam. Can I sign up for your class? Our class isn't a hole in your ear. You don't sign up only to impress the girls. So write her a letter, invite her to a movie... but don't mess up my class just to impress a little girlfriend. Hold this. Isn't there a nice girl in judo class? Thank you, madam. Little friend... Sharon, the girl you danced with, could use a partner now. So I'll let you come one more time, as a trial. Forward, aside, close. Back, aside, close. Back, aside, close. Down, up, up. - Chen. You're a homosexualist! - Chen, you're a Russian bisexual! - Chen, the girlie Russian! - You little pussy! Two, three... Esti, what's chewing gum doing in my class? What are you doing? You're dancing sideways, like a crab. The other way... with your thick ankles, you stupid cow! If we won't be accepted to the competition... I'll cut your face up so that even your own mother... won't recognize your ugly face. Stop, stop, stop. Stop, stop... Who here is men? Who the men? - The man? I am... - So lead, please. You. One, two, three. Stop, stop, stop. You know machina? A car. A car, yes? Driver has wheel. Where is your wheel? In the wurst. In the waist. In the wurst, the wurst, the wurst. You tell her where she go with the wurst. Come on. Closer with wurst! Closer with wurst! Now why are you afraid of little girl? One, two, three... One, two, three. One, two, three. Roman, what's up? Who is that kid? Does he pay? - I don't know. Leave him alone. - Gladly. He's all yours. And one, two, three. And one, two, three. - Roman, what happened to you? - What happened to me? What happened to us? To our self respect? There should be at least a minimum standard. Since when can any kid come off the street to our class? - I let him in. Why are you so hard? - Because enough is enough. For three years, we've worked in this stinking hole. Housewives salsa in the evening... in the mornings, it's tango for senior citizens. And in the afternoon, I have to wipe those little brats' noses. - Why me? - Why you? Are we here because of me? Where are you going in the middle of work? Okay, eyes up front! Whoever wants to participate in the contest, raise your hand. So please remember. It's the annual National Contest and anyone who wants to be in it must what? Work your ass off! Work your ass off! Work your ass off! More or less, Esti. You must practice a lot at home. Three, four. If you want to practice sometime, I live on 5 Bracha Street, apartment 3. So little friend, are we going back to judo? Sorry if I disturbed you... it's just that I have to learn the steps... because I want to dance in the contest. Look, Chen. You're not going to the contest... not because of steps. You can learn the steps in two weeks. But the judges in the contest, they already know the steps. What they want to see is a couple. - Do you know what a couple is? - A woman and a man? No, it's much more than a man and a woman. A couple helps one another, takes care of one another... trusts one another. In short, a couple is a lot of hard... - work. - Yes. Have you ever heard of someone winning first place in a dance contest... all by himself? Could I really learn the steps in two weeks? When you bang your head against a wall, what hurts? Your head, or the wall? - Yulia? - I'm coming. Look, little friend, for the contest, you need to know at least... the English Waltz and the Cha-cha-cha. Now, I have a class to teach, sir. - Hello. - Yes, sweetie? My name is Chen. I'm from the dance class. Oh, it's you. - Is Sharon home? - Sharon, you have a guest. - Hello. - Hi. Do you wanna practice the English Waltz and the Cha-cha-cha with me? Why? Do you want to be in the contest? Yes, there are three and a half weeks to go. You know we'll be last place. Maybe next to last, that if we even get in. So you don't want to. Don't let me lead. Two, three. With the wurst, two, three. Closer with the wurst, two, three. One, two, three. Closer with the wurst. Don't let me lead. I didn't know what to do with myself when he told me why. But you know that lying pig. - He fired me for no reason. - Of course. If you don't bring home one shekel, there's nothing to look for outside. Certainly not salsa, samba, or caramba. Oh, just come and dance with me once and you'll see how much fun it is. And who will work 25 hours a day to pay the rent for the store... the mortgage on the house? Who? Julio Iglesias? I can't be shut in here all day. I'll go crazy. You stay at home, and don't you dare drag the kid out with you. And how many times have I told you not to talk to him in Russian? - Does he live in Russia? - I don't understand what's wrong... with speaking Russian. Be so kind... - Do you have anything against hair loss? - What a joker... What about hair coloring? Do you think that would help? I'll pull out all of your hair! Where have you been all night? "Where were you last night?" Read it. I asked where you were. So read it and you'll know everything. How did he find us, this Jorgen? Who cares? We're going to a contest in Stockholm... like in the good old days. Did you check in the mirror lately while we're dancing? Half of our pupils dance better than we do. We're a little rusty, so what? A little lubrication... a lot of rehearsals, and hocus-pocus... and the Rabinoviches... are back. You want to go in the middle of this semester's course? I don't understand. What course, little kitten? Next month in Stockholm. A contest for professionals. First prize, 30,000 Euro. Milan, Vienna, Moscow. That's our future. No, Romik, we've been there before... and I don't want to remind you how it ended, and who was to blame. I should have found myself another partner... when I still could. It's still not too late for you. Do you have some cash on you? This goddam ATM took my card. You're starting to sound like an Israeli. If only you'd know a bit of Hebrew... after three years of living here. I already started brushing up on my English. You won't be selling eyeliner in this refugee camp forever. I'm telling you, in Stockholm... you and I are going to make the biggest comeback in the history of dance. Just don't disappear on me again. You promised. I didn't mean to worry you. Excuse me, madam? We're here again? I just came to tell you that I know the English Waltz and the Cha-cha-cha. Okay, let's see. Now, little friend, the waltz is a dance of court... - Yards? - Ship. Courtship is a game. Show me that you know the rules. Bow, please. Good. Now I know that you respect me and I agree that you court me. And I come to you. You do not come to me. You show me that you're not looking at little girlfriends on the side. Instead of your eyes, put your hand where I almost... We are only going to dance. And one, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. I'm not the teacher now. You're the gentleman. You lead. One, two three. I trust you. Waltz puts a lot of responsibility on the gentlemen. Are we going to hit the wall today? One, two, three. This is not a discotheque. Two. Three. Here we've got rules, two, three. Here we've got steps, two three. Now, show the audience you enjoy dancing with me. - You're having a good time, aren't you? - Yes. One, two, three. One, two, three. - Hi, Natalie. - Hello. Yulia said I know the basic English Waltz and Cha-cha-cha. I have a lot of work to do, but I've been accepted to your group... and I think I'll participate in the championship. Good luck. Have you been dancing with Arthur for a long time? Ever since we began. Why? You two again? I told you if you came back, I'd call the police, right? And you! If I see you again, I'll pierce your dick, without any anesthesia! So get lost! Okay. Excuse me, madam. You want them to take my license away? Get out! Go! - What color are my eyes? - Brown. - Are my lips thick or thin? - Regular. - Do my ears look like pan handles? - No. - Do I have a double chin? - No. Can't you see I need plastic surgery? But you should know that it doesn't matter. Models don't need classic beauty anymore. They have to be photogenic. Do you think I'm photogenic? Of course. Yulia said: "Arthur and Natalie are the most photogenic couple." If we take first place in the competition... photographers will take my picture, and my photos will be in the paper. That will open the door to the world of modeling. And no one would call a model ugly, would they? Natalie, can you wait a couple of minutes? It's important. It's about being photogenic. - Just wait a minute and a half, okay? - Okay. - Hi, Dad! - Open a tripod and put a tweenie on it. You know the saying, "Trouble begins when the bride is too pretty?" Give him your hand. The problem with a bride who's too pretty... is that you fall in love with her, and she makes a doormat out of you. Take my wife, for example. She's out of work, lies around the house like a dead body. She doesn't shave. She doesn't shower. Breaks my heart to look at her. I'd put her on a plane back to her mother in Russia... but she's too beautiful. I'm crazy about her. I'm done for. Well, at least you don't have that problem, right? Smile! Chen! What's going on? It's nothing. Look in your partner's eyes. Rumba is a dance of love. Stop. Stop, stop, stop, stop. Eyes over here. Sorry I'm interrupting you all. I truly apologize. What's going on here today? Arthur, what is so funny? Esti's filthy. Your mother's filthy, you son of a bitch. May your prick burn off, Amen. May you be buried in Hitler's black grave... you scum, you fart, you monkey's ass... Esti, that's enough. - Now Shahaf and Arthur switch partners. - What? I'll die of the stench. Only that deaf boy can dance with her. Because he's deaf in his nose, too. He's not deaf, he's hard of hearing... - and you'd better not open your... - Arthur! Today, you'll dance with Esti... or else you won't be in the contest. - But I didn't say anything. - You heard me. Esti, that goes for you too. This is the last time you use that language. Now be quiet. I only want to hear steps and music. I'm reminding all of you to look in your partner's eyes... and show your feelings. Rumba is a dance of love. Time for a career change. Fitting into the scenery. - Do you want to join in? - Romik... I can't demonstrate the Rumba by myself. I don't have time for midgets now. I started working on original material for Stockholm... so that we can start practicing right away. Look. I'm going to show you a little something I've been working on. It's a bit dangerous, but don't be afraid. I want to call it "The Mediterranean Schnitzel." And it will end up like the Cuban Eagle? What Cuban Eagle? I have been apologizing for the past six years for that. - The Pope'd have forgiven me already. - Who's blaming you? I slept by your bedside for three whole months. And managed to screw only half the nurses in the hospital. Why only half? All of them. - Bye, beauties. - Bye, Roman. I'm sorry. Roman, This thing about going to Stockholm is so... I worked an entire year to get that Stockholm invitation. We won't get another chance like this. - You're the one who arranged it? - We have to get back to Europe. Look at me. This place is killing me. If we don't get out, it's only a matter of time... before you look like one of those aunties... and I'll be lying drunk on some dock. So please, whether we go or stay... I want an answer this week. Yes, little friend, why aren't you dancing now? It's because... well... I have a question. Shahaf, you're not in rhythm. What is your question, sir? Can I be Natalie's partner instead of Shahaf? - Thank you. She has a partner. - But Arthur is with Esti now. Arthur's with Esti for half an hour. You don't just break up partners. Haven't you been listening to anything I've said? Arthur curses and insults Natalie. I know. I understand Russian. - No, you don't understand. - But you said that it's a dance of love. That you look in her eyes and show your feelings. And Arthur, he doesn't love Natalie. So it's a lie. And I don't love Sharon, so that's a lie too. What's wrong with lying, sir? Only animals don't lie. That's why animals don't have manners, or theater. Animals don't get married. Animals don't dance. Have you ever seen a donkey dance the English Waltz? No. I let you come to this class because Sharon chose you. No one else was good enough for her until you showed up. She's been dancing alone for 3 years. It's bad enough that her dad died. I trust you to be a worthy partner. Can I count on you? Yes. And tell your mom to come to the office. This class is not free of charge. - What did she say about me? - Nothing. Look into my eyes. This is the Rumba. If you're dancing with me out of pity, I'll beat you up. - Look into my eyes! - I'm looking. I forgot to tell you not to come and practice tomorrow. I have better things to do. Chen! Look out! You! Don't you dare get close to Natalie anymore! Got it? - Do you hear me, or not? - But this class... Natalie is my partner, and you know what place we'll be in the championship? - No. - Fourth place? - Fourth place? - No. - Third? - I don't know. No. - Which place will we be? - First. First! And you keep your hands off of Natalie... or I will stick a knife through your skull. Do you understand? Yes. Chen. 50 shekels. Bye. Do it. What did I tell you about that box? I'm your big brother and you will do exactly as I say... or else I'll tell Dad and he'll beat you up. What happened, Lena? Lena, what did you do? Lena, get up. I'll change the sheets. You can't sleep on these sheets. They stink. Lena, get up! You have to get a hold of yourself, my darling. Make room for me, love. You know I can't sleep alone. Mom, on Tuesday, we have a Judo championship. I can't go. Tell your dad to go with you. No, it's so you can go to salsa. You know, Tuesdays, Dad's always at a wedding till late. If he asks, you were with me at Judo, understand? My knight in shining armor. That's good, Vicky, go on! Hello, Natalie. Can I sit next to you? You remember what you said, about being photogenic? I have a camera. I know a bit about that kind of thing, and if you want to... I think your eye is bleeding. Who did that to you? You have to make sure it doesn't get infected. You want me to come and help you? I have some experience with that. No. Go home. Do you live far away? Hi, Grandma. Why won't they let an old woman die? If I only had a knife. If I only had a railroad track. If only I had a high rooftop. I would do it myself. Young man, if you do it quickly and painlessly... I won't be mad at you. Come on. Come on. Come on. Do you have any alcohol? Sorry. Is this all for your grandmother? This is for Grandma to poop... this is for when Grandma is in great pain. This is for Mom when she's sad. This is so Mom won't get pregnant. This is so Mom can fall asleep. This is also Grandma's. I forget what it's for. Maybe it's poison? Want to check? No thanks. I found what I need. This burns a little. - Why are you laughing? - Because I feel my face. You what? - Can you keep a secret? - Yes. Promise that if you tell, you will instantly die... - a slow and painful death? - Yes. I can't see my face. In the mirror I can, but not the same each time. And when there is no mirror, I can't see it at all. - But nobody can. - You can't either? My eyes are in my face. Just like yours. - Can you feel your face? - Yes. And now? Sometimes, everything gets erased and disappears... even my eyes. But that's not so bad, because when I'll win the contest... when I'll get on TV, then everyone on the street will recognize me. And they'll say, "There's Natalie! There's Natalie!" And then, I'll be sure that it's me, and that my face is there... and that it's still the same. Right? Right. Swear that you won't tell anyone, ever. I swear. I don't know where you disappeared again... but if you think that leaving me alone at night... might convince me to go to Stockholm with you, then you are very wrong. Sleeping alone like a dog all night I can do here in Ashdod. Go by yourself, if you want. And another thing: You and I have only three things in common. A name, a history, and a debt to the bank. So we will play the old game, but with new rules. From today, you and I are a dance instructing company. We're business partners and I ask you to be a good partner. - Are you here again? - I just have a question. Not now. Come to the studio. But it's about... you could say, it has to do with your job. You want to buy cosmetics? We have a discount on lipsticks. Yes, well, let's say someone can't see his face. If he puts on these colors, like those here, will he see then? Chen, either I don't understand Hebrew or you're talking nonsense. I am not, I have some money. I can pay for it. Yulia to the main register. Yulia to the main register. Come with me. What do you need makeup for? Do you want to dress up like a girl? No, it's not for me. I'm not a homosexualist. - So who is the makeup for? - For a girl. There's something wrong with her face and I don't know if it's dangerous. - Chen, did something happen to Sharon? - No. - It's not Natalie again, is it? - No, why would it be Natalie? Listen to me, sir. - Who is your partner? - Sharon. So why aren't you practicing? The tryouts are on Tuesday. The tryouts are Tuesday? I thought you wanted to be in the contest. I do. Then you don't have time to stand here and talk about Natalie. I don't know how all that romantic garbage got into your head... but you're a kid. Next week, you'll forget she even exists. If you want a chance at the tryouts, work with Sharon from morning till night. And get yourself some clothes and dance shoes. What do you have a mother for? - Okay, I'm sorry. - You're welcome. I'll keep you safe. I'll keep you safe. Hello, is Sharon home? Sharoni, it's that boy who used to be your partner. - I'm not at home. - She's not at home. But, tell her that the tryouts are on Tuesday. He says the tryouts are on Tuesday. Ask him if he learned to look into the eyes. He nodded "yes". You know you're an ass? Yes. You're sorry, right? I'm sorry. - Did you at least bring your camera? - Yes. Get it and come in. I have to show you something. - Aren't we going up to the roof? - First, open it. Go ahead! I sewed it myself. My mom only helped with the sleeves. Thank you. There's also a pair of shoes, from the neighbor's kid. Thank you. "Thank you?" "Thank you?" You're a tough client, you know? All the other boys I sewed for were very satisfied. Not funny? Wait, I have another one. A turtle family went for a picnic... father turtle, mother turtle, boy turtle and dog turtle. Suddenly, it started raining. Why are you laughing? I still haven't finished the joke. Sorry. You are the strangest boy I have ever met. Good afternoon to all our young dancers, and welcome to the tryouts! Shortly, we'll know which of the couples here today... will represent our magnificent dance club in the National Championship... that we will host tomorrow here in Ashdod... and will be broadcast on TV! I would like to apologize that, due to a Judo Championship... our community center is taken. So here we are, on this wonderful, picturesque field... made available to us by the municipality. And now, permit me to introduce our guest judges. Anna and Gregory Peschayev from the Quickstep Club in Ashkelon. - What's the rush? - There's a Judo Championship today. And you didn't invite your dad? It's Tuesday. Don't you have a wedding today? There is a wedding... but from what I heard, you're not that great at Judo, anymore. I heard you've been seen at a dance class. Me? Of course not. That's what I said. My son? With bowties and patent leather shoes? Only Russians don't realize how funny that is. It's not just for Russians. How would you know? I heard. You also probably heard that Russians... like all our neighbors and most of our clients... think they invented God, that every one of them was born a poet and a doctor... when in reality, they're security guards and cashiers. But I have different plans for you. Or would you rather be an unemployed waitress like your mother? But I'm half Russian. But you're more than half not-Russian, right? - How many half-kids do I have? - Two. - And which of them do I love most? - I don't know. Kid, from the day you were born, you've been daddy's son. Between your mom and me, you never can tell. But you and me, however they might cut the cake... we'll both end up on the same slice. True or not? True or not? True. Look at me. And I don't want to hear any more rumors about you. And now, without further delay... Okay. I have the pleasure of inviting the managers of our club... to start us off with a dance. Shake it, Soviet broad, shake it. What do I have to do so that you'll talk to me? I talk only business with you. Alright. How long will you play this silly game with me? So I forgot myself for a night or two. You know me. I have a laugh, I drink some vodka, I flirt with the aunties... I pinch some fat girl's ass. "How could I know that girl was under 16?" "Why must we run in the middle of the night, from Hamburg to Ashdod?" - It was all your sick imagination. - You are the one who's sick. My love, tell me what I have to do. I'll do anything. I want a child. So a child it will be. Even two. A boy and a girl. And they'll dance together. We'll be a family act: The Dancing Rabinoviches. Is it a deal, or not? Bravo, Soviet broad! Thank you to the marvelous couple... and now, for the first round, in the English Waltz... I invite all of the couples from the "Star" group. Sorry, I'm late. You look like a warmed-over omelet. - Where's the costume? - In my bag. There's no time to change. Turn around. Natalie didn't show up. - There's sand dripping out of your shoes. - Sorry. What are you dressed up as, you pansies? This is our field! - Go dance in Russia, whitey losers. - Watch your mouth! You lousy Russian trash. Watch your mouth, I said! You all suck ass, you faggots! Your sister sucks ass, asshole. Shut your face, skank! What's that? Get lost, you stinking sons of bitches. May your mother's hairy ass burn up! Your hooker mother sells your slut sister on the street. I hope they'll bury you in Saddam's grave. You and all your family. Esti and Shahaf. Get to the corner! Go back to Russia, those gentiles, sons of gentiles. Esti... I don't even want to talk about your big mouth... but a girl who looks like that cannot dance in the contest. Who do you think you are? I told you a thousand times, this is how I want it. If I don't want to shower, I won't. What will you do to me? Shahaf, don't you agree with me? Okay. You don't do me any favors. And you, don't either. This is what I'm like. And you can all kiss my ass, you, him and the judges. Esti! Teacher, did I insult you? I was just joking, Ms. Teacher. Shahaf, give me your hearing aid. Now turn around. This boy deserves to be in the championship. He deserves a better partner than you. But you're all he's got. He's in your hands. Do you really want to be in the championship, little friend? Yes. You're not going to win first place. And not second place. But... the judge here today is a friend of mine... so... good luck. - Thank you very much, madam. - You're welcome, sir. - Excuse me? - Yes? Natalie, why didn't she come? I don't know but we'll save her a spot in the contest. Now go get ready for the Samba. - What did she say? - That we're in the contest. Great! Great! Great! Aren't you happy? We're the greatest! We got in! Give me five! Way up high! Down low! Too slow! Hello, Grandma. - Is Natalie home? - No. Is she coming back? No, she's not coming back, ever. - Thank you. - Good bye. Natalie? I've been looking everywhere for you. You didn't come to the tryouts. I would've failed anyway. No, Yulia told me they saved you a place in the contest. - I can't participate in the contest. - Why? Are you blind? Yes, you're blind and stupid. Making me think I'm good and pretty and smart. But now I see my face. I see it all the time, and I'm ugly. If I come to the championship, everyone will see that I'm a shapeless monster... who doesn't know how to dance. And then you'll see, too... and even you will never want to look at me again. Natalie... Look at me, please. What do you see? Aren't you beautiful? Why are you good to me? Because I love you. I love you and I want to dance with you in the championship. Arthur is my partner. Arthur's a bad boy. He's mean. He's the reason you think such bad things about yourself. If you want, I promise to watch over you. I'm not that strong, but I'm stubborn, that's what everyone says. If we both ask, together, to be partners, Yulia will agree. Do you agree? I'll do what Yulia says. Let's go down. Natalie, please tell the viewers at home how you feel... about winning the National Ballroom Dance Championship. It's the happiest moment in my life. Can you tell the viewers what is the secret to your success? No, I can't. It's a secret. What are your plans for the future? I'm going to tour the world in a series of performances. Will you take your new partner along with you on tour? Of course. That's obvious. Is the interview over? Where are you going? What's wrong, doll? Slut. What happened, little friend? Chen, what happened? Everything you teach is just talk. A partner has to do this, a partner has to do that. All your rules are one big fraud and everyone knows it. You barely believe it yourself because you don't see anything. All those steps of yours make me sick, because they're all lies... and I won't dance anymore... not in the championship, and not ever again. When is the earliest flight out to Stockholm? I know it's two weeks away. I know tomorrow's the contest. I said order the tickets as quickly as possible. Which leg do you want me to break? Which leg? This one? Should I break this one? Should I break both of them? What did I tell you? What did I tell you? - To stay away from Natalie. - Or else what? - You'll stick a knife through my skull. - That's right. But before I stab you, Natalie wants to tell you something. I'm not dancing with you in the championship. I'm Arthur's partner. Again, maybe he's a retard and he still doesn't understand. I'm dancing in the championship with Arthur. We're going to take first place and we'll be on TV. Now, you tell Natalie goodbye for the last time... and she's going home... or else she can stay here and watch how we break your bones. What do you choose? Tell them to let me go, please. I'll tell her goodbye standing up. He's making you do this, isn't he? No. Goodbye, Natalie. - Get him! - Dad! We were dancing, all of a sudden he was all over me like an animal. - Did you sleep with him or not? - Rami, you're not listening. Couldn't you get a hotel room? You had to do it in the community center, where your son could see you? - I did nothing wrong! - Bullshit. Tell me exactly what happened. Now! - I just wanted to dance. - For the last time, don't lie to me! Dad, kids on the street want to beat me up. Not now. Go to your room. Do what your father says. - Three kids want to break my legs. - Chen, I said go to your room. - But what are you... - Go to your room! - Mom, you have to get out. - For once, do as you're told! Come to me. Everything will be all right, my sweet little baby. Your mom made a silly mistake. Just a little mistake. But don't worry. Mom will set everything right again. Stay in the room and don't come out. You hear me? No matter what happens. Stay in here! This is the end, you know. I'm going out to make some calls... and when I get back, I don't want to see you here. If you touch my son, I swear, I'll call the police. Come on... we're going to take some pictures. I'm done taking pictures. I promised I'd teach you to take pictures at night, didn't I? Come with Dad. It will be fun. Come on. Where are we going? It's a surprise. Get in the car. Chen, come on. I don't have time. Get in. Ready? Put on your seatbelt. Chen, come here! Chen! Chen! Chen! Stop! It's dangerous! Come back, I won't hurt you. Chen! Greetings to all and welcome to the National Ballroom Dance Championship. Let's have a round of applause for our contestants. Hobby class couples, please... take your places on the floor. Sharon... do you want to dance with me? Turn around. Couple number 88 and couple number 40... please approach the floor. Couple 88, we'll wait another five seconds. The first dance for this round is the Cha-cha-cha. Chen? Look at me. - What are you looking at? - Why aren't they filming me? Because you're an ugly slut. Look at me! Look at me! Cha-cha-cha. Two, three. Thank you, dancers. Very good. The second dance for this round is the Rumba. Four hours to go. Come, the cab is waiting, little kitten. - Wait a minute. Look at that couple. - What about them? They're so beautiful together. Look at him. At who? The little friend. He is falling in love right now. Right before my very eyes. He's dancing from the heart. I didn't teach him that. And... I see him, and all of a sudden, I feel like dancing. And we are going to dance in Stockholm. I'm not going. It's not the time for jokes, little kitten. That was the deal, we travel, perform, then have children. I already have children. What's wrong with you? Didn't we say like in the good old days? In the good old days, we danced. But for ten years, we've just been doing the steps. The last dance in this round is... the Viennese Waltz. Sir, will you please dance with me? Something very interesting is going on today, here in Ashdod. And it's totally against all the rules, but... Come on! Katya! Anna! Shay! Anna! Hey! That's not fair! Lena... shall we dance? Just once. One last time.
