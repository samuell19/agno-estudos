I'm on a bus back to Cleveland at 4:00. I was wondering if there's someplace I could put this while I walk around. Sure, Father. Right where you came in, there's a blue building. That's the hospitality center. They will be more than happy to help you with whatever you need. They got some great refreshments there. Go! Go! Freeze! (GRUNTING) Drop it. (GRUNTS) Let's go.

(CHOIR SINGING AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL) DIRECTOR: Sopranos, you're flat, you've gotta reach for those high notes. We all want this over as quickly as possible. I don't steal from people who can't afford it and I don't hurt people that don't deserve it. So relax. (WHIMPERING) I'm no better than you. You're no better than me. If I say I'll do something, I'll do it. If you say you'll do something and you don't, I'll make sure you regret it. (SQUARE DANCE MUSIC PLAYING) (MUSIC CONTINUES) (STAMMERING) We don't have the keys to that cabinet. Only Mr. Leeds has those keys. ROSS: Shut it, old man. Hands behind your back. Everyone! Hands behind the back! (WHIMPERING LOUDLY) GUARD: Stay down, Ben! Back down, sailor! (STUTTERING) I make minimum wage, please! I'm nobody! I don't wanna... Please! I don't wanna die! I don't wanna die! Shut your cocksucker or I'll blow your head off. (WHIMPERING) Hey, I'll take care of this. Tie him up. (PANTING) Calm down, calm down. Take it easy. Shh. Take it easy. It's okay. Everything's gonna be just fine. I promise. (WHIMPERING LESSENS) What's your name? (STAMMERING) Ben. You got a girlfriend, Ben? Mmm-hmm. She loves you, right? What's her name? It's Hannah. Tonight you're gonna be sitting with your arm around Hannah, watching this on the 10:00 news. She'll be so close, you'll feel her breath on your neck. And when she hears how nobody got hurt today because of your cool head she's gonna press her warm hand against your cheek. She's gonna look into your eyes like there's no place else she ever wants to look again. Trust me, Ben. It's gonna be a good night. Thank... Thank you, Father. On the floor. Hands behind your back. MELANDER: Okay, let's get in. That partner of yours better be right about what's inside these tin cans. Hurry up before he drinks it all. (IN ENGLISH ACCENT) You're right. We should have left earlier. (CHUCKLING) Hey. You look beautiful, Claire. I bet you say that to all the girls. You know you're the only one. What about your partner? Come on, your dad's important to me. I know it. I love that you love him. Hey, Dad! Hurley! ...you think, and you'll... Hey! Howard, excuse me a second. Sure, sure. There's my little girl. Claire, who's this bum you brought? Hi, beautiful. Hi, Daddy. I'm going to find Jen. Good. Go see her. It's so good to see you, man. You too, Hurley. Okay. One down, one to go. How's it look? What do we got? Full. Totally full. (SQUARE DANCE MUSIC CONTINUES) MELANDER: Ching, ching, baby. I got everything from a guy who's worked this fair for the last eight years. Blueprints, everything you need. They rake in a big haul on Saturday and Sunday. One, one-and-a-half million. Not bad, huh? PARKER: So you think I need those guys. HURLEY: Yeah. It's a five-man job. How do you know this guy, Melander? Melander and I worked together out in Portland, 20 years back. Always had a good crew. Independent, like us. I told him right off, if you were in, it's your show. You're in charge. Number two, good to go. (SQUARE DANCE MUSIC CONTINUES) (ALL EXCLAIMING IN FEAR) (PEOPLE SCREAMING) (DISTANT EXPLOSIONS) (IN AMERICAN ACCENT) Let's go. ROSS: What the fuck was that? Just stay with the plan. Move it. (PEOPLE SCREAMING) (SIRENS BLARING) It's total fucking panic out here! Here. (GRUNTS) All right. Down on the floor. Stay out of sight. We're going out the back. So, we all good? (IN ENGLISH ACCENT) You were supposed to torch the hay bales behind the livestock pavilion, away from the midway. You know what? There was some trouble, so I improvised. Big fuckin' deal... Ahhh! Someone gets hurt, cops come after us. That's the big fucking deal! Motherfucker! I said behind the livestock pavilion. (GROWLS) Thirty seconds. Come on! I'm rolling! Right now! (TIRES SCREECHING) (CHUCKLES) I gotta say, Parker, you came as advertised. So, I've decided to bring you in on something else. Something big. Look, 200 grand each isn't gonna make any of us rich. But if we all kick in our share as seed money towards the next little piece of business down the line, we all end up with two million. Each. PARKER: We just took a million bucks. That's a hell of a lot of seed. And that's just for the house. I don't think so. Look. Picture one of those duffel bags, only instead of tens and twenties, it's filled with diamonds and pearls. Jewelry's 10 cents on the dollar. No, thanks. No, not 10 cents. I'm getting 20. MELANDER: Parker, two million each. We've got someone on the inside. It's the score of a lifetime. Guaranteed. We made a deal. You said we'd split the take. That's what we need to do. Why don't you think about it? Come on. Parker, hey. We're talking millions. Seriously. (SIGHS) Okay, Parker, cards on the table. I'm gonna need the whole score for this next thing. So, if you were me, what would you do with a guy like you? Divide up the shares and that'd be the end of it. What if you decided not to do that? I'd kill him while I had the chance. Jesus Christ. Oh, shit. (GRUNTING) MELANDER: Watch it! (TIRES SCREECHING) Whoa! Grab him! MELANDER: Shoot him! HARDWICKE: Oh, my God! Grab the gun! (TIRES SQUEALING) Grab it! (GRUNTS) Ahhh! Shit! Damn! (MELANDER YELLS) MELANDER: Stop him! (TIRES SCREECHING) Oh! Son of a bitch! My nose! He broke my nose! Let me see, let me see! (GROANING) What kind of an idiot fires a shotgun in a fucking car! Shut up, Hardwicke! CARLSON: Oh, my God! Shut up! CARLSON: I'm bleedin', man! (WHIMPERS) Stop this blood. Go finish him. Wait, wait, wait. Look. He's fucking dead. Let's just get the fuck out of here! I don't give a fuck who your uncle is! Now, you wanna be a part of this, you go finish him. ROSS: You heard him, Hardwicke! Go! CARLSON: Go do it! Get the fuck out of here! CARLSON: God, I gotta get out of here! Handle your business! CARLSON: Come on! I gotta go! Do it! Blow his fucking head off! (GRUNTING) Fuck. Fuck. You got to fucking bend sometimes, Parker! You're so fucking stupid! Do it! Come on! Good. Let's go, let's go! I didn't get a good look at his face, just that he was a priest. So far as his build or that goes, I don't know. I guess I'd say average. INTERVIEWER: Did he say anything to you? Not really. Nope. JAMES: That looks like a man's shoe up there. JAMES' WIFE: That looks like blood. BOY: Hey, Eddie! Look at that! James, stop! There's a man! Boys, stay in the truck. You think he's dead? I don't know. You boys hang back. I'm going to check it. Oh, sweet Jesus. Come on. BOY: What do you want us to do, Daddy? He's alive. BOY: Take him on the other side, here. EDDIE: Okay. JAMES: Get him over. Come on, now. Get him out. Let's go. (ALL GRUNTING) BOY: Wait, wait! Support him. JAMES: How you all doing, boys? Look at my back? Mmm-hmm. Too many scars. If you came into the ER with this many holes, we'd be prepping you for the morgue. That's why I stay away from hospitals. Stay still. We're going to get you to the hospital. We gotcha. (NEWSCAST PLAYING ON TV) FEMALE NEWSCASTER: That's right. Nicely done, Benjamin. Well, a silver Suburban used by the thieves who struck the neighboring Ohio State Fair on Monday was found in a strip mall across the state in Cincinnati, Ohio. Now, the men made off with approximately one million dollars and are believed to have set a deadly fire while making their escape. A 51-year-old Sedalia resident, Charles Stockton was killed in that blaze that injured six others. (PEOPLE SCREAMING) Anyone with information is asked to call Crime Stoppers... (ON ELECTROLARYNX) Don't get up. You were shot. I'll call the nurse. Don't you call the nurse. (PANTING) Where am I? Covington, Kentucky. You know... Do you know what happened to you? They don't even know your name. Hey. Hey. Are you crazy? ORDERLY: Good morning, ladies. NURSES: Good morning. ORDERLY: How are you today? NURSE: Doing good. Okay, Mr. Quinn! Radiation's all set for you. Help the man. This man needs some help. Okay, okay, no problem. Let me get you set and I'll check him out. This man needs help. Come on. Get up, get up.

Please don't. Please don't hurt him. Please. Oh, my God. Is he dead? He's dead. You killed him. PARKER: No. (MONITOR BEEPING) Praise the Lord. What's... What's going to happen now? Please don't hurt me. Please. (INDISTINCT TALKING) SHERIFF: Ain't no wallet, no ID on him. OFFICER 1: You said he was shot two times, though? MAN: Yeah. Found at the side of the road, left for dead. OFFICER 2: How long was he in surgery? I need you in the chair to hold up my weight. Don't call attention to us and I'll let you go as soon as we're outside, understand? OFFICER 1: Is he talking? SHERIFF: No, I believe he's still unconscious. Yeah, a farmer found him. We'll get you inside now. (GRUNTING) Hey. Feel better. You too. (GRUNTS) (GROANS SOFTLY) ROSS: Blow his fucking head off! Do it! HUNTER 1: I got it! HUNTER 2: Get your ass in the truck. Ain't going to be no ducks left. I'm about to leave you. (SHOWER RUNNING) (THUNDER RUMBLING) (ENGINE STARTS) PARKER: Mr. Norte, I'm a friend of Bob Hurley's. Yeah. Listen, I need some documents. Don't worry about the money. I start a new job in the morning. (VAN BACKING UP) (INDISTINCT TALKING) JACK: Don't cash your check when she's around. DRIVER: Be back at 18:30. All right, we'll see you later. Do what I say and you won't get hurt. Mine's bigger than yours. (INDISTINCT TALKING) (GROANING) It's not the size, it's how you use it. What the hell? You got hurt because you didn't do what I said. (GROANING) Your bulletproof vest doesn't cover your legs. Next time I'll take out your eye. Who the fuck are you? Do right, in a few minutes you're on your way to the hospital. They'll get you, you know. Yeah. So don't sweat it. It's only money, you're insured, and they'll get me. Get up. Remember I got a gun on you. What's your name? Jack. People call me Jack. Move it, Jack. (GROANS) What's your partner's name? Oliver. You say, "Oliver, I got shot. This guy helped me." Nothing else. (BANGING ON WINDOW) I got shot. Thank God this guy helped me. Jesus. It's small but it hurts. He knows we're wearing vests. He'll shoot you in the face. Can we get this over with so I can go to a goddamn hospital? Okay, Oliver. Help Jack get into the other room. I need cash. You know they're gonna get you for this. Yeah, Jack already told me. (MUFFLED SPEAKING) Sorry about the leg, Jack. You sit tight for five minutes, I'm gonna call you an ambulance. NORTE: Hey! Come on in, senor. You made it in record time. So you're Hurley's friend. I'm glad you found us, Mr... Well, step right this way. You know, this was my daddy's business. We make most of our money off the high schools. You know, printing yearbooks, diplomas... Stuff like that. I need to be able to buy a car, get a loan. Name, birth certificate, driver's license. Social. Passport? Anything else? Did you bring a picture? No. NORTE: Ernesto... (SPEAKS SPANISH) Five days, my friend. (BELL RINGING) Come on through. You're out. Go. Move. (CELL PHONE RINGING) Hello? It's Parker. Yeah? PARKER: There was a problem with the job. I need you to do two things for me. Yeah. Name it. First, let Claire know I'll be gone longer than I thought. All right. You got it. Second, you know where I can get a hold of that client, Melander? What happened? I invoiced, but I wasn't able to collect. Oh, Jesus, Parker. Uh... Are you all right? Where is he? (SIGHING) This is not a good idea. After you didn't call I did some checking. It turns out that Melander is not as independent as I thought. He's got connections. Big connections. We're talking Chicago. Danzinger. So don't start anything. Hurley, it's me. Give me a name. Listen. Hardwicke is a nephew of Danzinger. You understand? Give me a name! (SIGHING) Jesus Christ. All right, here's what I got. His brother, Bobby Hardwicke, owns five bars on Bourbon Street. Plus a rock 'n' roll club. Now, listen, you be real careful. These are bad guys. (JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING) (BAND PLAYING ROCK MUSIC) (SINGING INDISTINCTLY) BOUNCER: Trying to get in? PATRON: Yeah. BOUNCER: All right, go ahead. I need to see Bobby Hardwicke. Not going to happen. Tell him Mr. Danzinger sent me. Wait here. Idiot. Get out! (GROANS) I got 300 people down there and you're telling me you only got 200 pays. That means I got 100 fucking guests. Who are these fucking guests? Relax, Bobby... Now don't tell me to relax, you understand? What? Bobby Hardwicke? Out. Private. I need you to tell me where your brother is. Get him the fuck out of here. Come on, you heard... (GRUNTS) You son of a... (GRUNTING) (GROANING) Your brother went off on a job with a man named Melander. (WHEEZES) Do you know how fucking connected I am, chief? They took money that belongs to me. Tell me where they are and I'll get out of your hair. Do you have any concept of the unholy shitstorm you're about to unleash by fucking with me? Do you? (GROANING) First I should tell you, when I say I'll do something, I always follow through. Always. Ahhh! Fuck you! If you don't tell me what I need to know I'm going to press down on this chair until it crushes your trachea. Trust me, it's agonizing. Plus, there's the posthumous humiliation of having been killed with a chair. (GROANING) Florida. MAN: Joey? Joey? Holy shit. (BOBBY GROANING) Where in Florida? Palm Beach! (COUGHING) Palm Beach, for Christ's sake! Bobby! Jesus! You okay? Fucking get him! Get him! (CONTINUES SINGING) (VIBRATING) CLAIRE: (ON VOICEMAIL) Hi. You know what to do. (BEEP) Claire. Claire, I wish you'd keep that thing on. Look. Trouble might find its way up there. I think you'd better talk to a travel agent. Tomorrow. (CELL PHONE RINGING) (MUTTERING) Yeah? Hurley. Time for a vacation. Yeah. (ALARM CLOCK BEEPING) RADIO ANNOUNCER: Here's your Mighty 690 forecast, folks, and let me tell you Palm Beach weather, it's just unbelievable this time of year. (GROANING) The temperature drops to 50 and everybody's wearing boots, sweaters, and leather jackets. Then, poof the next day it's 85 and we're back in flip-flops, halter-tops, and board shorts. There's nothing between Sherry and... Oh, God! There will always be something between you and Sherry. Always. (GASPING) You're not going to wear that skirt! You know we can't wear earth tones! It's Tahari. Oh. That's what's important. Not your hips. It's what they expect me to wear, Ma. They tell you what to wear, what to drive. You can't afford it. You know I'm not loaning you any more money, right? Can you open my pills? My hands are bad. I put them out. At least take Pipsy out. (WHIMPERING) Leslie! It's your dog. And it's my house! It's a condo, Ma. ROSS: I put one of these devices in each speaker. When these babies go off, all hell's gonna break loose. Hey, just watch what the fuck you're doing. The beauty is, speakers will still be able to work. (CELL PHONE RINGING) Trigger's very simple. Hey, bro. Nah. Hold on one sec. CARLSON: Now, will you just shut the fuck up and concentrate? Are you sure? (SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) Bobby. I'm... CARLSON: Look at this thing. ROSS: Stop playing with that thing. (ROARING) Fuck! What the hell was that? What! He's alive. Who? Parker. He knows we're here. Oh. He ambushed my brother. He tried to kill him. Parker's dead. You got out of the SUV and you shot him. Right? Yes. I fucking shot him. You... (GRUNTS) I fucking... He was dead when I fucking left him! I swear to God! We need five men for the gig. We can get by with four. It don't work with three. Fuck! (AUGUST CHOKING) All right. Okay. You get with your uncle in Chicago and you have him handle this. With a real professional. Now. That fucking Danzinger better do something for all the money he's going to make on this haul. (PANTING) The Mafia doesn't usually touch family, but who knows with Danzinger. I'm not taking any chances. Jen should be packed. I'll be back and get you in 15 minutes. Yeah. Hey, don't worry. He'll be fine. Claire... It happens. Yeah. Not to me. God. Dad, it never happened to us. Yeah, I know. Times change. I'm the one that should be jealous. He called you first.

Two minutes after he left, a strange man with a big knife let himself in. Was that... (SNIFFLES) Was that a message, too? Listen. Drive straight to the fishing camp at Okeechobee. No stops, no calls. You'll be safe there. Gotta make sure you're not being followed. How long? I'll be there Friday. What if you're not? Parker! Empty the cash out of the storage locker and disappear. (SIGHS) LESLIE: Look, I'm one commission away. I'll get it to you by the end of the week. I swear. No, you don't understand. I need my car for work. If you repossess my car, I can't pay you. Please, just... Just give me another week. Great. Thank you. Next week at the latest. (HANGS UP) LESLIE: Hi. An Americano with two Splendas, please. BARISTA: We've got it all ready for you, Leslie. Oh, thanks for remembering. Leslie Cienfuegos. Rodgers. Right. How is the ex? You hear from him? Shouldn't you be over in West Palm? I like it here fine. Like you do. Hey, you have a cup holder in your car? Or you just keep that between your legs? Well, it's large and black, Jake. Where do you think I like it? (CHUCKLING) Yeah. We'll see who's laughing next time you need a ticket fixed. Jackass. MAN: Don't fuck with us! Just give us Parker and you're done! Am I talking to you, boy? Am I talking to you? Shut up! MAN: Fuck you! You know who we are? You deliver or you're gonna be dead like Parker. NORTE: What are you talking about? I don't know any Parker! (NORTE AND ERNESTO TALKING IN SPANISH) Huh? Watch out! Dissatisfied customers? I don't have dissatisfied customers. What I have is you. And now I have this! (SPEAKS SPANISH) Your gun. Give me what I came for and I'm gone. You brought them here, now you get down on the floor with them, boy! We had a deal, Norte. I gave you your money, now give me my papers. Fuck your papers! I don't need this bullshit! Did they say they were from Chicago? We didn't say. Shut up! Get on the floor. Did they mention someone named Danzinger? Look, I don't know anything. All I know is, I got a situation here. You know who I think brought them here? Ernesto. He sold you out. (SPEAKS SPANISH) Get on the floor! (GRUNTING) (SCREAMING) (PANTING) All right. I'm done. (GROANING) Hey, look. We... We don't have to kill each other. These men wanted you. I don't want any part of it anymore. I'm like... Sweden. You mean Switzerland. (STUTTERING) Whatever. Your documents are in that middle drawer. Right behind me. Right there. Take them out. (ERNESTO SWEARING IN SPANISH) (ERNESTO GROANING) Daniel Parmitt. Ecuador You're an American citizen. Born in Ecuador. (STAMMERING) There's lots of gringos down there. Your family was in the oil business. Pick up the gun. Now look here, there's not very many people that can do what I do as well as I do. If I get dead, a lot of people are gonna be very upset and they're gonna come get you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Everyone's gonna get me. Pick it up. (ERNESTO SPEAKING SPANISH) Shoot them. The other way we can do this is I shoot 'em, then I shoot you. I'm trying to help you here, Norte. Listen, pal, you can still get out of this alive. Why did you stop? They're dead! Then they won't feel it. Keep going! (GUN CLICKING) Toss me the gun. So now what? You got a hold on me, right? I don't need a hold over you. Not if you make all this disappear and tell anyone who asks I never showed up. What do I say about them? Maybe they died on the way here. Don't forget to take care of their Navigator outside. Ecuador HURLEY: I just hate flying. I hate it. I mean, the goddamn landing was terrifying. It went up on one wheel. I thought I was gonna die for a minute. I mean, Jesus, Jen's already at the lake with the damn dog. What about Claire? Taken care of. I promise she's safe. All right. Okay, so, Danzinger must be the fence to get 20 cents on the dollar. That's why Hardwicke's around. Yeah, I'd think so. You know, two million dollar share, five ways, 20 cents on the dollar... Hmm. Fifty million dollar score. Yeah. So wherein Palm Beach? Oh, no, no. Parker, I'm telling you, Bobby was lying. Not Palm Beach. Look, the problem is not the score, the problem is Palm Beach. Nobody does business there. There's a cop to every eight residents. Drawbridges. They could shut the island down like that. (SNAPS FINGERS) You're trapped. The state pen is full of lightweights that have tried it. You know Melander. Is he a lightweight? No, Melander's not a lightweight. But it doesn't matter. Listen, I got a call from Danzinger. And for whatever the reason, they want it to go down without a hitch so they sent me this to give to you. (UNZIPPING) This is your Ohio share plus 10 points. Take it. Go somewhere with Claire. Keep your money. Who are you kidding, Hurley? Chicago doesn't pay to keep people out of their way. For Christ's sake, Parker, Danzinger's a fucking savage. He sent an assassin to your home, he almost killed my daughter. I'm just trying to help you. I don't want it from you. I want it from them! It's the principle. Principle. (SIGHING) You wanna get yourself killed over principle? And me? Claire? Is that what the fuck you want? You almost died on a plane runway. If it's gonna happen, it'll happen. It's not something you can control. When I enter an agreement with someone, terms on both sides have to be honored. If they're not, and I allow that, I'm asking chaos to take control of my life. Nobody likes chaos. Yeah. Yeah, no one likes chaos. That's right. Hey, look, what if... (SIGHS) What if you had a place in Palm Beach to sit things out? Nah, nah. Cops would be all over the rentals. Nah, not a rental. What if you... What if you bought a house? Hmm. Palm Partners, how may I help you? Hey, Noelle, any messages? All right. I will transfer you to Mr. Samson. BONNIE: Why do you even read the society pages? It's not like you could ever go to one of those parties. Look, if a normal couple gets divorced, they need two houses instead of one. Rich couple gets divorced, they need four houses instead of two. BONNIE: I don't know what you're worried about. It took me two years to get my first commission. Even then, it's only a quarter share. Yeah, well, I would've had my first if Jameson hadn't swooped in. Morning, ladies. LESLIE: If I don't sell something soon, I'm screwed. Amber picked up a cold call from some rich-ass Texan looking to buy his third vacation home. I've been answering the phone for three weeks, and nothing. They are great clients. All cash. What's Amber's line? Twelve. (PHONE RINGING) Hello? Yes. AMBER: But I'm gonna close them. Um... Excuse me one minute, sir. Thank you. No problem. Absolutely. I'll let her know. Mmm-hmm. Hello? Hello? Oh! That was Mr. Thompson. He said he wants to close on Edgewater right away. Said he's gonna be flying in at noon. Oh, his phone died while I was on the phone with him. If you want I can go take care of that for you right away. Oh! That's so sweet of you. But no. One, one, at a price of 1,000... Noelle? Excuse me one moment. Call Mr. Parmitt at the Boca Resort and tell him that I'll call him later to reschedule. Of course. Sorry about that. Again, the price was $1,155. And item 8-0-0-0 at a cost of $2,353.20. I can't believe you just stole her client. There's nothing wrong with a little (WHISPERING) stealing now and then. They do it to us all the time. Welcome to the Boca Resort. Mr. Parmitt? (IN TEXAN ACCENT) Miss Rodgers. Yes. LESLIE: Anybody who's somebody, and rich, (CHUCKLES) winds up in Palm Beach. I mean, more billionaires per square foot than anywhere else. Palm Beach is about style. Community. You know, it's... It's not about money at all. Of course not. Where do you live now? I got a place in Vail. One in South Padre Island. One in Maine. Yeah. I'd like to see a few more areas before zeroing in on one. Do you have time tomorrow? Sure, yeah. I have all the time you need to zero in on anything you want. I'll pick you up at your office at 10:00. I'll never remember my way around unless I do the driving. Taxi. Can I drop you somewhere? No, thanks. I'm good. Where to? Lake Okeechobee, please. Yes, sir. Take Highway 441 to Pelican Bay. (INDISTINCT MUSIC PLAYING ON HEADPHONES) (BLOWING) MAN: (IN TEXAN ACCENT) Pardon me, ma'am. Daniel Parmitt. San Antonio, Texas. (SQUEALING EXCITEDLY) I thought we agreed, no more scars. Hmm? I don't want to lose you. Mmm. Hey. I keep thinking about that man inside our house. I've been around thieves my whole life, but this guy... He was a killer. He really scared me. (IN ENGLISH ACCENT) They wouldn't have killed you, Claire. They'd use you to get to me. Then killed us both. You can leave, Claire. No one would blame you. This italianate villa was built three years ago. It's only $17 million. If it were older and one mile down the beach, it'd be $35 million. You like? (IN TEXAN ACCENT) Mmm-hmm. You know, the furnishings are all antique and they could be available for, you know... For the right price. So, married? Once. She passed away. Oh. I'm sorry. What about you? What does your husband do? Oh. Divorced. Eleven months. He was a salesman. He sold me. The whole dream. I thought he was something. His Ferrari was rented. At least it wasn't stolen. Well, he declared bankruptcy before the divorce so I get to help him pay off his debt while he lives there in Key West with his new girlfriend. And I do mean "girl." LESLIE: This one right over here, this has been on the market for about a year for about $27.5, but if you make an offer now you could probably get it for about $19.5-ish. It's a good price. LESLIE: This is, obviously, more of a neighborhood. The one here, with the screen of palm trees, this house sold, about two months ago, for $1.2 million. Mr. Rodrigo says he wants to renovate. Can you believe it? It's obviously a tear down. Mr. Rodrigo? Yeah. Amber sold it to him. You know, I think he said he's from Texas, too. I'll have to meet him some day. You know, the one nice thing about it is the Intracoastal's right down here. Wraps right around the houses. It's really beautiful. See what I mean? The intracoastal widens out here. So you lived in San Antonio your whole life? Yeah. Since I was about three. Tell the truth, I was born in Ecuador. My folks are both in the oil business down there. Ecuador? Really? That's what it says on my birth certificate. (CONVERSING IN SPANISH) I was in the management training program here before I got married. I could've got you a great discounted room rate, say, 11 years ago. (LAUGHS) You know, do you mind if I hold on to these? Fax a few to my banker so he knows ahead of time what I'm getting into? Yeah, sure. I mean, they're all sold. I just wind up tossing them anyway. Here. My card, too. Mr. Parmitt? Uh... Daniel? (CHUCKLES AWKWARDLY) Um... I know that you're in town alone, so, if you'd like, we can go over more places, say, over dinner or just drinks? That is so kind, but I'm afraid I have other plans. I'll be in touch. Okay. Plans. (SIGHS) (PIPSY BARKING) Pipsy, stop. (SPEAKS SPANISH) Leslie, put on the soap channel. Do we have to have the soap opera channel always on? I pay for it. (SOFTLY) I pay every minute. I heard that.

We'll put Pipsy in the carrier. The girls would love to see you! (FOOTSTEPS RECEDING) (DOOR OPENING AND CLOSING) (SOBBING SOFTLY) (DOG BARKING) MELANDER: All right, let's get it while it's hot. HARDWICKE: Jesus Christ. I'm over this shit. I'm sick of beans. MELANDER: We have to lay low. HARDWICKE: What? That's bullshit. I don't understand what the big deal is to go out and get two pizzas. MELANDER: We'll go. But we call it in, we go and we pick it up and we bring it back here to eat. Okay? HARDWICKE: I'm getting cheese. CARLSON: I'm getting two pepperonis. (GARAGE DOOR OPENING) (UNZIPPING) If he's in town, we can't risk him getting any of us alone. We have to lay low... My uncle sent his best guy to take care of Parker. Mr. Danzinger's going to be very disappointed you haven't seen Parker. Listen, my friend, I keep telling you. I don't know anybody named Parker, all right? (MAN SPEAKING SPANISH) Nice new carpet. (GROANING) (KNIFE SLICING) (WHIRRING) I love that shit. Give me those pies. (GARAGE DOOR WHIRRING) (REMOTE CONTROL BEEPS) (WHIRRING) HARDWICKE: I ain't waiting for you old guys. CARLSON: Get that pizza in there. Don't worry about it, man. I got the pepperoni. (GARAGE DOOR WHIRRING) If you're free, maybe we can go for that drink now. (IN TEXAN ACCENT) Who knows you're here, Leslie? If you want to go somewhere more private, we can go to your hotel. Or we can go to the office. I have the keys. You know, Mr. Crenshaw usually keeps a nice bottle... (GASPING) om When I ask you a question, you need to answer. Ow! Ow! Ow! You're hurting my neck! Who knows you're here, Leslie? No one, okay? No one! Let's go to your office. Fuck! You know, everything you did in the car today was almost right. Almost. But I didn't buy it. Is Daniel Parmitt your real name? Why wouldn't it be? Because you're less than two months old. You have a bank account, an address in Texas, and a driver's license. You never owned or leased a car before this one. You never had a credit card and you never had a mortgage. You know, I've traveled a lot. My family business pays for everything. And the only house you showed any interest in was the one back there. Mr. Rodrigo's. Really? It was back there? Really. You know, I looked into Mr. Rodrigo, too. He's only six months old. Okay. Why are you parking all the way over here? We could've parked right in front of the office. There'd be no cars there this time of night. Let's go. Unless you don't want a chance of being seen. Is that what's going on? Wait a minute. Keep moving. (IN ENGLISH ACCENT) Don't turn those on. Ah. English accent. I knew you weren't from Texas. Look at that. A nice Chablis. Will you be joining me? Okay, well, I'm thirsty. Ugh! Yeah. I drink too much. And I worry too much. Divorced, pushing 40. I have a sister I haven't spoken to in five years. And I'm stuck with my mom. Doesn't look like she's going to kick off any time soon. I'm sick of chauffeuring these fucking entitled wannabe playboys who have never worked a day in their life. Showing them houses that I could never afford. Laughing at their jokes that I can't stand. All while fending off their gropes... But not all their gropes. Because you never know. One of these days I just might get a full commission. So if you're going to kill me, go ahead. I live with a snapshot of my future and nobody's going to know and nobody's going to care. But if you're not, I can help you. Help me? People in Palm Beach are sharp. Very sharp. And people like you only come down here for one reason, money. And I don't know what you're into... Kidnapping, extortion, robbery... But whatever it is, you're gonna need somebody who knows the territory or you're gonna get caught. Take off your clothes. What? I'm not sure if I'm better off with you alive or dead. Either way, I have to know if you're wearing a wire. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) Look, I've been in a third of the houses around here and I know the rest. I can answer your questions and I can tell you what questions you're forgetting to ask. And all I'm asking is for you to give me a small piece so I can get the hell out of here. Turn around. What? Turn around! (SIGHS) You know, to even find Rodrigo, you had to play that roundabout game with me and all it did was make me suspicious. I mean, how many people do you want asking questions about you? Lift your hair. Get dressed. Wash up the wine glasses. Lock up before you leave. I'll think about it. (CHUCKLES) MELANDER: Hey, Lionel! What do you say? I got something for your jones. Don't blow it all on the ponies again. Tell me what you got. I want to know every last detail. (TIRES SCREECHING) Leslie! Okay, last chance. All this right here could be yours for one low price. Hey. What's the matter? Nothing. Just... I bought a lottery ticket two days ago. I don't think it's going to pay off. Leslie, what'd you do that for? Those things are a waste. (CELL PHONE RINGING) Hello? Mr. Parmitt? Yeah, I have the perfect condo that I could show you! I'll meet you at 1000 Ocean Avenue in 20 minutes. Yes! (LESLIE GIGGLING) DISPATCH ER: Signal four, rollover with injuries at 124 North County Road. Code one. Right on time. You can park right there. DISPATCHER: Bravo 24, please respond. So, I'm hired? You don't have to check me for a wire again, do you? I mean, you can if you want. We got work to do, Leslie. You're hard to read. Not really. Let's just stick to business. Here's the deal. Don't ask me any questions because I'm only going to tell you what I want to tell you. The man who calls himself Rodrigo took something from me. He's in business with three other men. They're here for a robbery and they're gonna use that house to lay low when they're done. So... You let them steal something, you steal it from them. I help you and I get a commission. You're going to kill them, aren't you? I never said that, Leslie. You did. Civilized people need to follow rules. I'm just going to put things right. Where are they going to hit? I thought that was something you could tell me. You don't know? (CHUCKLES) Well, when are they doing it? I don't know that either. But it's jewelry. None of the stores I've checked have the inventory. How large? Fifty to seventy-five million. Mrs. Clendon's jewels? Are you fucking kidding me? (STAMMERS) Forget it! They are going to get caught, or killed and so are you if you're anywhere near them! Leslie! You can't leave. (CHUCKLES) You're in. LESLIE: Miriam Hope Clendon was the first lady of Palm Beach Society. She had more diamonds than Elizabeth Taylor! And when she died, she left the entire estate to Palm Beach. They're auctioning off her $75 million jewelry collection right here tomorrow night. What's behind there? Thirty acres, a golf course, pool, tennis courts, two ballrooms, and it's one of the only houses that's on the ocean and the intracoastal. Hey, Miss! This is private property! Oh! Sorry, guys. Just taking in the sights. No, no, no. That's too much white. Take them away and bring back some pink roses. And just what is this now? Speakers for the auctioneer. Small ballroom. Around to the right. Okay, Linda, you cover the left side, Robert, the right. Report all paddle numbers to Barry, who will be standing next to me. (CLEARS THROAT) Where do you want these? Put speakers in the corners. Uh, Barry, excuse me a minute, would you? (WHISPERS) Go get the gear. I'll meet you by the basement. Mmm-hmm. Stash that shit by the exit. MELANDER: Hurry up! LESLIE: So, you been in jail? (CHUCKLES) Do you ever feel bad about what you do? Everyone steals, Leslie. Some people admit it to themselves, some don't. It's what human beings do. That's why we invented locks. You think the people in these houses feel bad? Their grandparents and their great grandparents, they're the ones who got their hands dirty. I just mean, how do you sleep at night? I don't drink coffee after 7:00. Is this the back entrance? Yes. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) There's a taxi stand at the Breakers. What's going on? Out. Out! (SIGHS) Wait a minute. Can't you, like... What's the plan? What do I wear? Do I wear black? What are we doing? Go to your office. I'll handle this. This is getting old, you know!

(KNOCKING ON DOOR) (PIPSY BARKING) ASCENSION: Leslie, someone's at the door. Jake. Leslie. Mind if I come in? Yeah, I do mind. What time is it? I mean, how the hell did you get my address? It's sort of official. ASCENSION: Don't let him in! At least make your dog shut up! Can you do that? Yeah, what's going on? It's about a man named Daniel Parmitt. Oh, I don't know even how to use this thing. That's why I always get coffee. What... What about Mr. Parmitt? Do you know him? Yeah, he's in town from Texas. I, uh, I showed him some places, and he turned out to be a real time-waster. I happened to be driving past Sloan's Curve yesterday, and I saw you talking to someone. Yep, that was him. I showed him a condo. You think you can get the other list of all the places you showed him? Sure. I'd have to get it from the office. Why? Well, if there's a vacant place that he knows about... (WHIMPERING) He may just get it in his head to make himself at home for a while. Shoot. Can you please get that for me? Oh, damn dog. Always tracking in God-knows-what from who knows freaking where. (PANTING) And, he got into an altercation in his room with a fellow. The fellow went over the balcony and he's dead now. We haven't been able to ID the victim. That's crazy. (EXHALES) What about Mr. Parmitt? We assume Mr. Parmitt was hurt pretty bad. He ran out of the hotel, stole a car. No one's seen him since. Well, I guess I can kiss that commission goodbye. They found your business card in his room. We don't know what he was into, but I just wanted to give you the heads-up. LESLIE: You know, if you come by the office later,.. ..I could give you his application,.. ..and anything else you need, okay? (SIGHS) You know, makes you realize how dangerous this business can be for a woman. I mean, I was in places all alone with him. I mean, he could've killed me. That's why it might be good if you started thinking about not being alone anymore. (SIGHS) (CHUCKLES) Yeah. Sorry to wake you up. No, it's okay. Thanks again. (GASPS) Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Mi Dio! I can't believe he's not barking! Yeah, dogs like me. What do you need? Do I need to get you towels? Oh, my God. There's so much blood! What do you do when there's so much blood? Do you wash it? Do you not wash it? I need you to listen... Do we put pressure on it? What do we do? Leslie! Leslie, listen to me! Do we get a towel? Do we get a... What? Listen. Get dressed, get in your car,.. ..find a pay phone, and call this number. Okay, okay, I can do that. Might not be an answer but maybe. Then go straight to work. What? Yes. I can't leave you here! We have to get you to a hospital! You could die by the time I get back! Leslie! (YELPS) Leslie! Go. Okay. Okay. Okay. (WHIMPERING) So, Pipsy, you like this one? Can you make soup? Como no! Hi, um, my name is Leslie Rodgers. Uh, Daniel Parmitt asked me to call. Yes. Well, why don't you go ahead and take a look at both places again before you make your final decision. Yeah, I could be there in half hour. Okay. Bye. Oh, my God! MAN: Is that a... That's a person! WOMAN: Oh, my gosh! MAN: Oh, no! WOMAN: Did you see that? Oh, that's so terrible. WOMAN: Call 911! (CHUCKLES) AMBER: You ladies have a great day! I thought that guy sounded like trouble. I mean, Ecuador? Yeah. Just my luck. Are you okay? I'm going out. If anyone from the police comes, just give 'em the list of places I showed Mr. Parmitt, okay? What's the matter? Nothing. I just... I just need some air. (GASPS) I was afraid you were the cops. What's going on? Are you a nurse? I'm Claire. Leslie. Hi. I named her after Leslie on The Young and the Restless. Mom. Her sister's named after Jennifer in Valley of the Dolls. They don't care, Ma! (CHUCKLES) I used to have a beauty salon, and the TV was on all day. I told you to go back to work. I was, I did, I was... I left. I thought I was calling somebody to take you to the hospital. I can't do that, Leslie. I have something to do tonight. Are you crazy? You almost died! Wait. Well, you have a... A mangled hand, a broken rib! Four this time. This is a real man. You're in no shape to do anything! You... You can barely even sit up! Would you tell him, please! I can't stop him. He is who he is. Okay... All set. Do you want me to call a taxi or leave my car? I'll find a car. You're good at that. Claire... I didn't think you'd stay. I know. PARKER: Will you wait for me at the fish camp? CLAIRE: You know I Will. Um, Ascension, I've left a bag with his clothes and some amoxicillin in it. Thank you. Oh. (CHUCKLES) Thank you so much for taking such good care of him. ASCENSION: Oh, please, it was nothing. ASCENSION: Please, please. CLAIRE: Thank you. Bye. Come back to see me. Bye. Bye. Bye. Sopa de pollo. That cop, he's watching you. Go back to work. When you come back, I'll be gone.

(SHRIEKS) (SCREAMS) (CLICKS) (GASPS) (SHRIEKS) Fuck! Let me... Let me explain. You were supposed to torch the hay bales behind the livestock pavilion. (LESLIE SCREAMS) (LESLIE SOBBING) Come on! Wait. Not so fast. You shouldn't have come here. I thought you might need help. (GRUNTS) And what happened? Did you know that guy's gun wouldn't go off? When I broke in the night you followed me... I bent the firing pins on most of their weapons. Most of them? (GASPS) Here's what's gonna happen. (GRUNTS) Take the jewels to your office... (BREATHES HEAVILY) Find an AC vent, open it, and stuff 'em in. Put the grating back on and forget about it. But... You don't tell your mother and you don't check on them to make sure they're still there. In about three months, I'll send someone in to get them from you. Might take a long time to fence, but after that's done, you'll receive your share by express mail. (BREATH ES HEAVILY) You can't put that money in a bank, Leslie. (CHUCKLES) You can't go on a crazy shopping spree. Okay. But... How much will it... I get the first two hundred thousand. My original share. The next two hundred thousand, goes to my old partner who planned the job. Then we split the rest. How much? With the right buyer, your share will be millions. Mmm. (CHUCKLES) (GROANS) Oh, sorry! I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Oh! What? Wait, wait, wait! Where are you going? I'm going to lie low for a week or so until things calm down. I'll have someone drive in and get me. Claire? I never did have a chance, did I? PARKER: Danzinger? Yeah. Who the hell are you? Parker. All right. All right. I was going to give them 20 cents on the dollar. I'll give you 40. It's not about money. (KNOCK ON DOOR) (PIPSY BARKING) ASCENSION: Leslie! I got it. Morning. Sign, please. It's heavy. Okay. Ooh... (GRUNTS) (GASPS) Oh, my... ASCENSION: Leslie, who was that? It's the mailman! Nothing but bills! (CHUCKLES) (SQUEALS HAPPILY) (LAUGHING) We have received bounties from heaven. Like a new house, plenty of money to pay off all our debts. You know, I believe that man that we found on the side of the road that day, he wasn't no man at all. He was an angel,sent here to test us. © © © P © P@ © P@r © P@rM © P@rM! © P@rM!N © P@rM!Nd © P@rM!Nde © P@rM!NdeR © P@rM!NdeR © P@rM!NdeR M © P@rM!NdeR M@ © P@rM!NdeR M@n © P@rM!NdeR M@nk © P@rM!NdeR M@nkÖ © P@rM!NdeR M@nkÖÖ © P@rM!NdeR M@nkÖÖ © P@rM!NdeR M@nkÖÖ ™
