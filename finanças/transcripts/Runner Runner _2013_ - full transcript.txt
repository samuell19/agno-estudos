Mister Herrera. Paid in total. With dollars, as you wanted. What was once paid in full is now only half. Me doing damage? I'm a fountain of money in this shithole. I put millions into your economy. I give employment to hundreds of people, with better salaries than you can pay. I understand, that's exactly what I tell them. How much did I give you already? Who knows? If I give someone 5.7 million dollars in three and a half years, I notice it. And in return, I expect more than advice on a horse. I want stability. Listen to me. You have stability and you know it. Your problem is with me, let him go. What do you want?! He's gone, he left the country early this morning. Is this gonna work? I guess we'll see. Did you bring something for me? I am a man of my word. Very good. I'm also a man of my word.
