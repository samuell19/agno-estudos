- Unit 66. Unit, uh, 66 calling dispatch. Come in, dispatch. This is dispatch. Go ahead, unit 66. Is that you, Larry? - Yeah, it's me, Ida, stuck on shit detail out here at Hull House. Well, it coulda been worse. - Oh, yeah, how? It coulda been me. - You're a funny gal, Ida. Unit 66 over and out. The heck? Hello, anybody here? What the? - Good evening, officer. - Oh, you, uh, startled me. Uh, what are you doing here? - I'm getting ready for Halloween. - You, you, you telling me you've been living here? - Uh-huh, why do you ask? - Well, this is county property. No one's allowed to be here. - Why not? - Well, because of the murders. - Murders? - A few years back, Halloween night to be exact, group of kids from St. Rita's Academy got massacred here. - Here? Oh, God, how awful. - Yes, ma'am, um, I'm sorry. You're, you're gonna have to leave. - Says who? - Well, says me. You see this badge? That means I'm the law, and we have to obey it. - Here, I'm the law, and it's time to pronounce sentence. - Pow. Trick or treat, Lois? - The fuck is wrong with you, huh, Reggie? - It was a joke, Vince. Relax. - It's kinda cute, thanks. - Yeah, sure, glad you like it. - Smooth move, bro. - Yeah, bite me. Hey, Reg, that's a pretty cool joke, man, real def. Yeah, sure, whatever. So what's the plan? - Just cruising for some cuties. - Yeah, hmm. Looks like you already caught a couple. - What are you doing in my room? Hey, not in here. Get outta here. Get out, now. I'm telling you. Get out, get out. Get outta here. Hey, get. - Sorry, your mom said I come back. You all right? - It's okay. Thought you were my kid brother. Oh. - Did your mom let you have Fiero? - Oh, no, the station wagon. So much for being cool, huh? Abbie, what are you doing with these? - They're college brochures. - Yeah, but we aren't graduating for another year. - I know. Not all of us can be head cheerleaders, you know. Some of us have to work twice as hard to get noticed half as much. See, each of those colleges has a boy-to-girl ratio of two to one or better, so while I'm earning my BA and my PhD, I'll actually be working on my MRS degree. - Geez, I, uh, haven't even decided on how to wear my hair tonight. - Come on. You can't honestly tell me you haven't even thought about college. - Um, I've thought about it, sure, Abbie, but I don't know. Sometimes I feel like my life isn't kicked into gear yet, just sort of biding my time, you know, waiting for something to happen. - Mm, like a cute guy with a rad car to come along. - Yeah, listen, I, I'm using your shower, okay? - Sure. You still going as a harem girl? - Yeah, and you know that thing's really skimpy. I can't wear a bra with it. - Good planning, huh? If I had your body, I'd never wear a bra. Hell, I'd never wear anything. - Abbie, what are you talking about? You have a great body. - Think if I water them, they'd grow? - I'm taking a shower. - Shit, man, yo, where are all the women at tonight? Probably at the dance. What dance, party boy? The costume dance at school. - You might have heard about it if you went sometime, Nick. - Yo, who cares, man? I'm gonna find me a bitch who can suck a golf ball through 10 feet of garden hose. Think you can find one with a friend for me, huh? - Dr. Frankenstein couldn't find a friend for you with or without the mask. - That's funny, Lois, especially coming from the girl voted most likely to. Ooh. Nice one, nervous. - Hey, dickhead, that's my woman you're talking about. - She started it, man. - Well, apologize to her. - Come on, Vince. Apologize. - That's it, baby. Make him beg. - 'Kay, Vince, you made your point. Now, let him go. - This ain't none of your business, Nick. - I'm sitting in a speeding van, and you're choking the driver. That makes it my business. - Fuck you. - I said let him go. - Okay, I apologize. I'm sorry. Just cool it, guys. Cool it. - That wasn't so tough, now was it? I don't even know why I let you hang with us, Orson. - 'Cause it's his van, you dick. - Listen, you. The next time you get in my face, you better have a whole lot more than just a knife. - And you better have a whole bottle of mouthwash 'cause your breath smells like you've been munching some stale carpet. - What's that supposed to mean? - Well, if I was going to be eating at the Y, I'd like to know who else was sampling the cuisine. - Okay, guys, yo, we're all impressed. You've both got big brass balls. Now, let's sit down before that claim makes me deaf. - Man, you got a death wish or something? You know how crazy he can get. - ‘Kay, try it again. Oh, man. - Can't you fix it? - What do I like, Mr. Goodwrench? - You're the one who took auto shop. Hey, Nick. - What? - Yo mama is so fat she wakes up in two different time zones. - Oh, yeah? Well, your mama is so fat the back of her neck looks like a pack of hot dogs. - Don't be starting this shit, man. - What are you guys doing? - Snapping, you know, doing the dozens. - Oh, you mean this is one of your small-town games? - Hey, yo, Reg, can I try? Yeah, sure, what the hell? - Yo mama has so many double chins she needs a bookmark to find her mouth. - All right, Orson, not bad, homie, not bad. - Okay, Orson, you can get off the mothers now, huh? 'Cause I just got off on yours last night. Hoo, hoo, hoo. - Hey, guys, look. - Well, well, well, if it ain't the head cheerleader herself and her little shadow. - Uh, dibs on the cheerleader, and you can take the friend. Fuck you. She's probably got a wilder fine thing anyway once you get her out of those owl glasses. What about me? - You'll fuck the car's tailpipe, Orson. - Good evening, ladies, might we be of service? - Uh, depends. Are you guys going to the dance? - Shit no. - But, uh, we'd be happy to drop you there. Uh, thanks, but no thanks. - We're out here in the middle of nowhere. It could be hours before another car comes by. - So we'll walk. - I don't have a coat. I'll freeze. - She's right. - Yeah, now, get your fine self inside, and we'll warm 'em up for you. - Look, you're freezing, too. Mm. - Abbie, come on. - Well? - What? - Aren't you in my algebra class? - I don't know. I haven't been there since the first week. - Ah, I knew I'd seen you before. - I must have made a big impression on ya then. - What would make you say that? - Well, why would you remember me? Hey, guys, miss cheerleader here has the hots for me. - So, what, do you want us to drop you at the school dance or a motel? - You're an actual jerk. - Hey, there's a Quicky Mart. Pull in, I wanna get some smokes. Vince, man, what do you think? An improvement. - Hey, Nick, I gonna get me some beer. Look, I lifted my brother Raolo's ID. Know what I'm saying? Yeah. Geez, it's the last one. - Here, you have it. - No, thanks, you saw it first. - Nah, really, I want you to have it. Thanks. Listen, I'm sorry for calling you a jerk. - Nah, listen, I was really outta line back there. I apologize. No, you were right. You did make an impression on me in algebra class. - Um, yeah, I'll take a pack of menthol Kools, too, please. - This is supposed to be you? - It is me. I just look a lot younger without the goatee. - Yeah, and I'm the queen of England. - Pleased to meet you, Queenie. Now, gimme my beer so I can get outta here. - Oh, I don't think so. - What do you mean? You're refusing me service? - You got that right. - Yo, look, pops, yo mama's so ugly Ripley's couldn't even believe it. - Fuck off before I call the cops. - Yeah, right, the cops. Yo, come on, man. Screw that, man. Whoa, whoa, man. I was just reaching for my wallet. - I'll engrave that on your tombstone, asswipe. - What should I engrave on your tombstone, asswipe? - Come on, Vince, yo, what are you doing? - Showing this old fart a bit of his own bullshit. I'd love to be brought back to. - Dammit. - The guy's an idiot. He should not be playing ball. - Hold it. - All right, son, now just take it easy. Easy, hold it. - Hey. - Shit. - Oh, my God. Oh, my God. - Oh, shit, where are the other shells? Where are the other fucking shells? - On the wall. - Let me go. - Reggie. Reggie. Come on, let's get outta here. - Oh, my God. - Vince. - Come on, man. - Reg, Reg is hurt. Man, hold on. - Abbie. Get him, man. Abbie, Abbie. Hang in, buddy. Let's get the hell out of here. Come on, hurry up. Open the door. - Shit. Sarge. Sarge, tell me you're wearing your flack vest. Are you, are you okay? - I just flew, I just flew through a fucking window. Of course, I'm not okay. Good, come on, we gotta call in. - Oh, my God, oh, my God. Do something, please. Oh, we gotta get him out here, please. Please, look at him. We gotta stop the bleeding, and let's turn ourselves in, okay? Please. - Fuck that noise, man. - Vince, we gotta get Reggie to a hospital quick, man. - Fuck Reggie, okay? I killed a cop back there, and you are all accessories. - Bullshit, pull over. I'm getting him out. - Forget it, Nick. Whether you like it or not, we are all in this together, okay? All of us. - This is kinda cool. - There was only four of 'em? - Uh-huh. So three, uh, three men and a woman? Uh-huh. One of 'em was in a mask. - Hey, Lieutenant. - Hi, how you feeling? Like I just kissed an oncoming truck. Listen, I'm really sorry ‘bout missing your retirement. - Yeah. - Kettle and a Twinkie, not exactly the event of the season. When's the official date? - 'Bout two hours, just after Cinderella loses her slipper. So what have you got for me? - Well, I finished taking the clerk's statement. You still wanna talk to him? - Is he still claiming it's a robbery? - Says the kids cleaned out the register just before me and the boy walked in. - So I still wanna talk to him. - Mr. Morris. - Hi, Lieutenant Dewhurst. Homicide. - I didn't think this town was big enough to have a homicide department. - I'm it. I'm also the bomb squad, the truancy division. Tell me, uh, you like magic? - Magic? - Yeah, you know, um, vanishing acts, sawing ladies in the half, you know, magic. - Yeah. - That's wonderful because you and me, we're gonna do a trick together. We're gonna make all that stolen money reappear before your boss gets back. Are you ready? Choose a card, any card. - I don't understand. - That's a Miranda card. And unless you start telling me the truth, I'm gonna read it to you while I'm dragging your sorry ass down to the county lockup. And then we're gonna search the store, your car, and every orifice in your body until we come up with the cash. - Oh, God. Okay. - Vince, where the hell are you going? - We're just gonna drive. We're gonna drive until we are a million miles away. - Reggie can't wait that long. And they got roadblocks all over the county by now. - Shit. It's okay, Reg. It's okay. We're gonna take care of you. Come on. - Shit, we're almost outta gas. Hang in there, Reg. - No place to run, no place to hide. - Fuck, don't you ever fill this thing, huh? - I put 20 bucks in this morning. That cop musta hit the tank. - Fuck. We're probably leaking gas all over the place. - We've gotta find a place to lay low, fucking cool out, and chill for a bit. Well, we can't go home. - No shit, Nancy Drew. - Shut the fuck up, Nick. - Fuck you, Vince. Reggie's bleeding to death back here, and you two are playing Bonnie and Clyde. Fuck, quit pushing me, okay? Fuck. - Hull House. What? - The old funeral parlor, Hull House. It's been empty for years. - You're crazy. - Dammit, he needs a hospital. That place is a rat trap. He's gonna die of some kind of infection if he doesn't bleed to death. - She's right, Vince. It's not a good idea. - You're right. It's a fucking great idea. - Uh, lieutenant, sir, roadblocks are set, and the town to sealed up tight. - I want you to remind everybody that these kids are not killers. - Yeah, it's not like they didn't try, huh? - Look, I don't want you or anybody else looking to get even. There's been enough bloodshed for one night. - Yes, sir. - You got too many bad habits, Tony. - Uh, yes, sir. Wants 'em to handle it with kid gloves. - Well, he's off the force in an hour or so, so he can bite my badge. - Vince, please don't make us go in. I'm getting bad vibes. - Fuck your vibes. - I'm serious, please. Once we cross over the underground stream, we're totally screwed. - What underground stream? - That wall is built on top of it. - Why? - Supposedly, demons can't cross over running water. Yeah, right, boo. - Well, maybe it'll work on cops, too. - Vince. - All right, Nick, come on, inside now. - I am not leaving Reggie out here. - Then, bring him with you. - He can't be moved. - If you don't get outta this fucking van right now, there's gonna be another ghost haunting this place, okay? - What are you gonna do, Vince, shoot me? - If I have to. - Go ahead. - What? Come on, tough guy. Pull the trigger. Blow my brains out 'cause that's the only way you're getting me out of this van, you stupid motherfucker. - All right, does anybody else wanna be a fucking hero, huh? - Not haunted. - What? - It's not haunted, this place. According to the legend, it's not haunted. It's possessed, a gateway to hell. - Ooh, and tonight's the one night the gate's open, right? Ha. - Come on. You said this place was deserted. Let's get outta here. It looks like somebody's living here. Well, whoever it is, they're obviously not here now. Hang in there, Reg. So cold. - We gotta get outta here. - I know. - I'm not talking about Vince. - Well, then who are you talking about, Abbie, huh? Demons? Well, where are they, huh? Where are these fucking demons of yours? Maybe they're the ones who put up these nice decorations. Hello? Hello, anybody home? Come out, come out wherever you are. - Guess they can't hear you all the way down there in hell. - Well, maybe I better stop a whispering then. There, that oughta be enough to wake the fucking dead. Don't ya think? - Where's that draft coming from? - Forget the draft. Smells like something died in here. - It's too late. We're all damned. Look. - I'll look. - What is it, blood? - Sure looks like it. - No, no, I, I must have hit a, a pipe in the walls. Probably just rusted water or something. - I don't know, Vince. I, I don't see any pipe. - Smooth move, numb nuts. - Give him a break. It's probably the closest he's ever been to a wet hole. - Well, anyway, that's, uh, well, let's see if we can find a warmer room around this place. Holy shit. Who the hell are you? Yeah, who the hell are you? - Who the hell are you? - I'm asking the questions here. - I live here. - Nobody lives here. - I do. I was just getting ready for trick-or-treaters. - Guess that explains all the lit candles. - Anybody else live here? - Depends on what you mean by anybody. - Better talk straight, bitch, or he'll blow your brains out, won't ya, baby? - Damn right I will. - Orson, gimme the gun. - No. - This is not a game. Now, gimme the gun. - No. - Drop it, Orson. Give it up. - Drop it. - Shut up, both of you, man. - You're not the powerless little wimp anymore, are you? - Don't make me shoot you, man. - You're not gonna shoot him. - Oh, I'm not, huh? - No, you need me. You need me to watch everybody while you make sure she's here alone. - Why should I trust you more than any of these other assholes? - Come on, Vince, 'cause I can do it. Honestly, I wasn't afraid of those cops back there. - Orson, what do you think you're doing? - Shut the fuck up. - All right, Orson, you take care of them and her. And we'll go check out the house, ‘kay? Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Go. Push ahead. - What are you gonna do? Just go. - Fuck you. - I'm on Mountain View about two miles north of Campbell Ranch. Tell me, uh, how many big barns you figure are out this way? 809, why? - You ever been to Vegas? Sure thing, won over $1,000 once. - You ever take in one of those magic shows? No, are they any good? - Yeah. I saw a guy one time made an entire elephant disappear. - No shit? - Yeah. Well, I know he didn't really make it disappear. He just found something big enough to hide it in. Like what, a barn? - Well, we know they didn't go back into town, and that leaky gas tank's gonna limit mobility, so they must be hiding out somewhere. Fuck this, I'm putting on some music. Man, I'm dying. - Shut up, man. Can't you keep it quiet? So proud. - What's that noise? - Mama's just forcing them to play with the girls. I don't think so. - What are you doing? Get back to work. - Fuck you. - What the hell is she doing? - She's distracting him. - Come on, let's get outta here. Now's our chance. - Are you sure you know what you're doing? - A guy in auto shop showed me how. - Hurry up. Vince is gonna go ballistic when he finds out we're gone. - Abbie, what about Nick? - What about Nick? We gotta get outta here now. - Abbie, I'm not leaving without Nick. I'm not. - Look, we can get help, okay? - You're a real tough guy, aren't ya? Guns are so sexy. Don't you think so? Of course, Vince has a much bigger one. But then again, size isn't really that important as long as you know how to use it. Do you know how to use it? I could help you. I believe in your potential. You do want me, don't you? - It depends. Can you suck a golf ball through 10 feet of garden hose? - Open wide and gimme some tongue. Drop that. Nick. - Where are you going? No. Holly. Unit 66, unit 66, this is dispatch. Come in 66. Larry, where are you? - Okay. - Reggie, I'll be right back, okay? I have to go find Holly. - Come on, open, please, God, open. Abbie. Unlock, so close. Holly, are you up there? Abbie, over here. Follow me. Come on, let's go. - How did you get away? - It wasn't hard. - Wait, wait, Reggie's over there. - No, later, we've gotta hide. - What are we doing in here? - Nick got away from Vince. - Great. Come on, let's go find him. No. Don't you realize? The minute you leave here, you go back to being Holly, the cheerleader's cute little friend, her cute little shadow, a nobody that has to try twice as hard to get noticed half as much. Wouldn't you just once like to be a man-eating cat, the kind of woman that Vince would find completely irresistible? - You could help me do that? - Do you want me to? - Uh-huh. Please don't. Look, I can't. Stop it. Too late, you've already made your choice. - What are you talking about? Happy Halloween, bitch. Oh, my God. - Let's just forget these airheads. Let's get the hell outta here. - No, we're all staying. There's nowhere to go anyway. In case you forgot, there's a dead cop out there. The hell is that? Let's see. - Vince. - Ida, I've come up empty at the Gentry Ranch, so I'm heading over to the Davis place. You sure you don't want some backup? - Not just yet. Give the boys a little more time to cool down. It's after midnight, you know. Officially, you're retired. So I'll make a citizen's arrest. - Just wait here, okay? - Don't go in there. - Just fucking wait here, okay? Abbie, what the fuck are you doing in there? - Waiting for you. - How did you get away from Orson? - I don't want Orson. I want you. Mm. - Were you talking to Lois or something? Holy shit, whose room is this, Mrs. Satan's? - Abbie. Orson? Open, come on. Where are you going, Holly? The party's just begun. - Orson, what's happened to you? - Damned if I know. I guess the devil made me do it. Left, right, left, right. - Oh, baby, you are a wildcat. Reggie. Reggie. Reggie. Come to me, Reggie. Reggie. You can do it. That's right. Come to me, and everything will all right. Oh, Reggie, it doesn't hurt. That's right. Come to me, Reggie. It'll be okay. There is no pain. Oh, come to me. You can do it. That's it. Reggie. This way. Who is it? What? What's going on? No. Shit. Lois, get in here. Keep an eye on her, huh? Orson let all the others get away. - Where the fuck do you think you're going? They hot-wired the van. - Don't forget to do up your fly. - Shit. - You and Vince?! I don't buy it, no way. - Me and Vince every way. - You lying slut. Come on, you freaking whore, you alley cat. Show me what you got. I said show me what you got. - What's the matter, Lois, cat got your tongue? Vince. Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God. We gotta get outta here. Abbie, Abbie, Abbie, she's— - She's a pussy. - So what, you fucking sperm receptacle? You're a fucking snake. And the Lord say thus to her. Let there be light. - Lois, Abbie. Fuck this, everybody. Motherfucker. Fucker. How about a silo or an abandoned ranch house? No nothing, unless. What? Ida, tell me. Unit 66 hasn't checked in for a while. - Hull House. Nick, you fucker. Gonna kill you. Come here. - Hello, hello, is anybody there, hello? - Can I help, miss? - Thank God, officer, I need your help. - You're not supposed to be here. - I know. - Look at this. - Are you listening to me? - You wrinkled my uniform, and you broke my window. - Are you listening to me? I need your help. - That's what I'm here for, miss. Please get the gun away from me. - This is not my gun, missy. This is my pistol. This is my gun. This is for shooting, and this is for fun. What the hell are you talking about, you idiot? - I'm just trying to give you a piece of my mind. See? Who said you could leave? Come back here. I didn't say you could leave. You come back right now. Come on, missy, come on. Come back, come back, come back. Come on, come on. Don't cross the street. No, don't cross the street. No, no, no, no. No. - Shit. I thought you were Vince. - We gotta get outta here. We gotta get outta here. There are monsters. - Holly. - There are demons— - Holly. - in that place. - Quiet. Stop. - Please. - There's no way. The van's bust. We gotta go in there and get everyone. Now, where is Reggie? - I don't know. He was in the van. I don't know. - Come on. We're gonna get him. - I'm not going back. - Come on. - Nick, I am not playing. - Come on. - Nick, please, no. Nick, I can't go back in there. 'Kay, we're going to find Abbie. Nick, keep your eye out for burning string. - Hey, Nick. Yeah, you. - Orson. - Yo mama's so stupid she raised a son who thinks he's gonna get outta here alive. - Come on. What the hell's going on around here? Am I gonna ask him? Hell, no. - Orson, you dumb fuck. - What? Why'd you do that? - Uh. This'll bring tears to your eyes. - Why'd you kiss me? - I don't know. I, I figured we may never get outta here, and it's something I've been wanting to do since that day I saw you at school. I knew you were something special that day I saw you, too special for a punk like me. Hey, Nick, hey, hey. You got a friend for me? Or should we make it a threesome? - Hey, hey, hey, come on, take it easy. I'm a cop. - A real cop? How'd you find us? - Magic, how else? - Do you have a car? - No, a carpet. Don't mess with us, man. We're having a really bad first date. - Come here. Just the bitch I was looking for. Man, are these cuffs necessary? Hold it right there, pig. Drop the shotgun. - I can't do that. - Try. - Please, he's gonna kill me. - Now, we're taking your car and getting the fuck outta here. Nick, she's one of them. - You mean like Orson? Vince, get away from her. - Fuck off, Nick, this is our only way outta here, man. - Listen to me, son. The officer you shot was wearing a flack vest. He's fine. You haven't killed anybody, not yet. - He's okay? - You're actually buying this bullshit? He's a pig. He's lying. Of course, that cop died. - Thinks he's so fucking smart, huh? Oh, the minute you drop that gun, that pig's gonna blow your fucking head off unless you shoot him first. - You trying to fuck with me, huh? Die, you fucking pig. - You kids all right? - Yeah. You all right, miss? - I think so. - Well, come on over here. Come on, you're safe now. - We have to tell him what's going on. - He wouldn't believe us. - We have to do something. - Suck on this, bitch. - Excuse me, but I've been such a scatterbrain lately. Lieutenant, come on, let's go. - Great fucking trick. Get out now, come on. Let's go. Come on, come on. Come on, please. - Hey, Dewhurst, remember me? Shoulda retired yesterday. You ran away from me before. Shouldn't've done that, sweetheart. Come on, Dewhurst, come on. Took my shit. Yeah, come on. Hey, who's taking shit now, huh? Come on, baby, come on. You, I want you. You. you're mine. You ran away from me. You won't run away from me no more. - Abbie. - Come on, Nick. Fuck this, man. The hell is this? They're not going down. Let's head for the van. Shit. - Wait. You can see that I can kill you at will. I can take your lives, but not your souls. Those must be given to me by word or deed. - You want our souls? - Not yours, yours. Your soul is fresh, virginal. It has great power. If you give it to me, I'll let these two go free. This one saved your life tonight, didn't he? I'm giving you the chance to do the same for him. - You'll really let them go? Yes. - What about this? - Come. Come, my children. Morning is almost here. It's time to return to the bowels of hell. - What the hell are they doing? And now, you might be some hero, and I'm just some guy with a bad attitude who's got some sort of future in auto mechanics. Now, let's get the fuck outta here. I know you wanted him happy, but I think Vince is keeping an eye out for me. - We have to come up with a plan. - And now, it's your turn. - Please. - You create a diversion. - What about your I'm no hero speech? - What about it? - You have a knife? Excuse me. I know you're a supernatural being with infinite powers and all, but I was just thinking, you see, I do a little magic myself. Now, listen, I've got this one trick I'm very proud of. I bet you've never seen it before. Watch carefully. I say the magic words. Hocus-pocus, abracadabra, and. You dare to challenge me, old man? Come on. - Come on. - No, no, it's stuck. Come on. Come on then. Come on, come on. - Let's go. The sun's almost up. Let's just walk. The house looks dead. Come on. - You kids all right? - Yeah, how 'bout you? - I've been better. Here. You know, neither of you was caught by the surveillance camera in the Quicky Mart earlier tonight, huh? You could just go on home. Nobody would ever know you were there. - What about this? What about all them? - Who would ever believe this? - Oh, be still, my beating heart. You kiss your sweet ass goodbye. - Come on, we're almost over the underground stream. - You have had your chance, and now you're gonna die excruciating deaths. - Holly, look, the sun's almost up. Come on, pull. - Go back to— - Pull. - where you belong, bitch. - Pull. Come on, Holly, pull. Come on, let's go. - No. May they all rest in peace. - Come on. We can't do anymore. It's, it's time to go. - Seven people died tonight. We can't just erase that. - The police will investigate, and so will the government. I, I can't explain it. - Exactly. That's why I'm coming back next to Halloween. - Why? - To make sure this doesn't happen again and every Halloween after that till I die. - We'll see. Happy Halloween. That demon this.
