- Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes "Hawaii, land of romance, apples and passion flowers. Hawaii, inspiration for the world's most alluring aids to beauty. Products of the Michelle Bennett House of Beauty... toiletry, cosmetics and perfumes that capture the fragrance of Waikiki, the magic of the tropic nights, the enchantment of the emerald surf caressing the gold white sands. Here on the sun-drenched Pacific isle, we find glorious womanhood in all her pulchritude." In all her what? In all her pulchritude. Alright, kill it. Give me the house lights! Kill it! Ah, Mr. Newcomb. I, uh... I didn't go to Harvard. I didn't go to Yale. I'm a milkmaid in Idaho. Oh, yes, yes. I'm a factory girl in Pennsylvania, and when I see this film at the BonTon Department Store's beauty show... ...on Main Street, it is all I can do to spell "cat". But "pulchritude" is a word of common use. I know, but if you'll pardon me, you, um... You have a girl on your arms, you're holding her. Well, just try to imagine it anyway. She has doused herself with Big Moment, the new Michelle Bennet perfume. She wants you, Mr. Newcomb, she reeks for you! You say: "Ah... sweetheart, you look so pulch... pulchritudinous tonight? No! No, you say, you look, um... Lovely, beautiful, gorgeous. And, um... that's what we want to say, Mr. Newcomb. We're advertising Michelle Bennett's beauty line... ...in words of one syllable, Mr. Newcomb, you got that? All right, Mr. Crawford, from now on, basic English. That's better. Now, rewrite the narration... ...and punch on every message with our slogan M.B M.W.B. "Michelle Bennett Means Wedding Bells" Good. Get it done. Yes, Mr. Crawford. Pulchritude. Pulchritude. - Got the Bennett layout yet? - You'll have it, Duke, plenty of time. That's all I hear, I'll have it, I'll have it. - Just hold it, hold it! - You hold it. - Oh! - What's the matter, are they mad at each other or something? - No... - Well get them together, mix them up, that's the whole idea of the thing. Michelle Bennett's lipstick is supposed to work like a magnet. But Mr. Crawford, composition is an artistic... Look, I'm an advertising man. Every gal gets her guy, it's a law of nature and it hasn't been repealed yet. - But Mr. Crawford... - And you be sure... ...and get the prints in my office in ten minutes. But Mr. Crawford, that's impossible. That is the motto of the Montgomery Advertising Agency, all of out stuff is impossible. - Mr. Crawford. Mr. Crawford! - Where's your bathing suit? - I'm your secretary, remember? - Oh yes, hello, Miss Adams. Mr. Crawford, you've already missed your appointments with Miss Potter, the Sesame Girdle Company, Miss Collins... Oh, women, women, women, why don't they stay home and have children? Can't you ever make me an appointment with a man? You know that Mr. Montgomery sees all the male clients. Besides, all the females insist on seeing you. - That's why I wouldn't be knowing. - Oh, you wouldn't, huh? - Answer the phone. - It isn't ringing, Mr. Crawford. - It is ringing. - It isn't. It isn't? You're a bunch of nerves lately, you jangle. - Jangle, answer the phone! - It didn't ring! - It did ring! - It didn't! Adams, will you go away for five years? Yes, I'll make a note of it. Get out of my... Not you, honey, I'm just... training to be a woman hater before I go stark raving nuts. Why are you following me? I'm not following you, I'm going to my office! It happens to be your office too. I was your secretary! Hey, Duke, you want to plan Harry Martin's... ...Hawaiian guitars for the Michelle Bennet radio program? Yeah, yeah, sign him up, the contract renewal's in the bag. Hey Duke, it's the Clipper Cab ad! "Shave as you go. Save time, save money." "Don't look shabby, call a Clipper Cabby." I thought you were off your nut when you first sprung the idea, but the public's really going for it. They ought to give you an interest in the business. Interest? They ought to give me the business. - It isn't ringing. - Hello? He's not in. Who's not in? Why have you got your hat on? I'm going out to look for a job. What's the matter with the one you've got? Don't you like me anymore? - You fired me, Mr. Crawford. - I did? Why, that's ridiculous, I'm raising your salary. But you did that yesterday. Miss Adams, will you kindly not presume to tell me how to run my business? I'm going to take a shower and I don't want to be disturbed. You took one an hour ago. Please do not tell me when I may or may not take a shower. I like it, it relaxes me, and... besides, I'm dirty. He's taking a shower, Mr. Montgomery. Another on? Good morning, Duke. Oh, come on in, Monty, I'm just going to take a shower. It refreshes me. How do we stand with Michelle Bennett? Um, there's something I've been wanting to tell you for a long time, Monty, I, um... I want you to take me off that account. My job's finished, the Hawaiian campaign's ready. Michelle will love it when you it to show her. When I show it to her? Now see here, boy, Madame Bennett... - Where is that hanger? - ...will discuss the account with no one but you. Madame Bennett must have her... Oh, Madame Bennett desires, Madame Bennett... I can't go on with it, Monty. She's got me on the ropes. She knows it's finished between us and won't let me go. I never want to see her again! I'm afraid you'll have to see her, Duke. My company may go on the rocks if Michelle doesn't renew her contract with us. We need that account. We need it desperately. - Oh, I know she's difficult... - Difficult? She's impossible! Being engaged to her for six months is like one long wrestling match with an octopus. Well, I suppose so... Let neither snow, rain, gloom or heat or night... ...stay the swift carrier from delivering the contract. - Swallow my pride, huh? - Swallow your pride. It's a luxury in this business anyway. What do you say, Duke? - Okay, I'll give it one more try. - Good boy! Amazing what a cold shower will do for you. I feel better already. Michelle Bennett Limited. Thank you, I'll be back at four. I'm sorry, but you'll have to tell San Francisco to call later. I cannot disturb Madame Bennett now. - Oh, Mr. Crawford. - Hello, Kitty. Miss Bennett has a very, very important conference, but I'm sure she'll see you. As you'll see later in the agreement, a slight deferment in the initial financing will be to your advantage. And the debentures will pay 2,5%. - Yes? - Mr. Crawford's here. Oh, just a moment. I'm sorry, gentlemen, but I must adjourn our meeting. - Adjourn? - But we're discussing... Please, gentlemen, not today. I'm afraid it's much too complicated for poor little me. I haven't the head for figures. - But Madame Bennett, your decision must... - Some other time. Of course 2,5% is ridiculous. Entirely too much to expect me to pay. Good day. Send Mr. Crawford in. Bye, Kitty. Ah, greetings, Your Majesty! - Hello, darling. - How's Marie Antoinette today? Your loyal counselor has arrived to settle affairs of state, and when I say settle, I do mean settle. Why, darling, you're not thinking of leading me to the guillotine. Forsooth, to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs? Not a bad idea. Dukie, you're not going to insist on talking business, are you? Look here, businesslady, I'm a businessman. - You need me. - Yes, we do need each other, don't we? Yes... in a sense. You make this goo and I sell it. It's a smart combination. Why do we have to break our engagement? Why do we have to get engaged? Now look at this stuff. Heavenly Hawaii, land of romance. Michelle Bennett's "Aids to Beauty" that glorify. You too can get your man. Be lovable, be kissable, be beautiful. Beauty creams, as smooth and gentle as the moonlight at Waikiki. Well, everything's worked out to the last detail. Magazine layouts, newspaper ads, new package designs, movie shorts and radio programs... All with the background of heavenly Hawaii. Kiss me. Look, Michelle, I've been through an awful lot lately. - Kiss me. - Please, Michelle, there's no time to start this... - And you call yourself a businessman. - What's business got to do with this? Because I'm wearing my new Kissable You lipstick. If you want to advertise it, you'll have to test it first, won't you? Yeah, I'll give a sample to lab. It's not only absolutely kiss-proof, but you know what else happens? No, what else happens? It actually cools your lips. That's different anyway... - I'll show you what I mean. - Now please, Michelle, you... You liked it, darling, didn't you? - It tastes like cough drops. - Oh, Duke! I brought the contract for you to sign. - Not now, darling, not now. - You're always saying not now. We can't keep going on like this. What exactly do I have to do to get you to renew this contract? Whatever it is, you'll do it. We'll talk it all over tonight at dinner. I'm gonna be very busy tonight at the office. I'll see that you are at your office by nine o'clock. - You really mean that? - I really mean it. Up, Duke. Up, up! Well... where are we? At your office, darling. I promised to get you hear at nine o'clock, didn't I? Yeah, but what day is it? Today, darling. It's such a lovely spring day. Thanks. Eight. Eight, Mr. Crawford. Oh, call me at nine. Eighth floor, Mr. Crawford. Oh. - Up? - No, thanks, I'm going to take a shower. Yes, Miss Bennett. He's taking a shower right now. Yes. Oh, please, Miss Bennett, you can't do that. Oh, dear. Oh! Mr. Crawford! - Mr. Crawford! - Yes, Miss Adams, what is it? Michelle Bennett phoned. She's changed her mind again. She says the Hawaiian motive is old-fashioned. Change Hawaii to Sun Valley. Mr. Crawford! Are you alright, Mr. Crawford? Mr. Montgomery! Mr. Montgomery! Oh, dear, oh dear! Ah!!! Mr. Montgomery. Mr. Montgomery! Mr. Montgomery. - Mr. Montgomery! - Yes? - It's Mr. Crawford. - What about him? First of all, she's changed her mind from Paris to Bal Harbor, then to Hawaii... Who, Michelle Bennett, she didn't sign? - Said go right ahead with Sun Valley. - Oh, dear. She didn't sign. Didn't sign. - Mr. Montgomery, did I tell you that Miss... - You told me that. He was standing right there. Well. Women! Deliver me from women! From now on I take accounts where I deal only with men. Men who cuss you out and don't mind if you cuss them back. Tough, hard-boiled, straight-shooting, he-blooded men. My feet! I can't stand on my feet! - You got them on backwards. - Oh. Oh, thank you, Monty. Well, I suppose we'll have to change it all over to Sun Valley if Michelle wants it. I'll change nothing! One more night out with her and I'll look like a jigsaw puzzle. Duke, maybe if you forgot about Michelle for a few days, you could come back fresh. Forget about her, how in the world can I forget about her? Have you read this book here, Duke? Next time I have a chance to read, I'll finish Peter Rabbit. Dean and Dalton are pushing it on their string list, mister. They want us to give it a big publicity send-off. What's the title? "Let's Live a Little", by Dr. J. O. Loring. It's all about your nerves, serenity of mind, how to achieve it. Dr. Loring's a well-known neuropsychiatrist. Hey, you know something, Monty? We could work up a swell campaign on a theme like that. "Why not live a little before you die a lot?" Why don't you get the campaign started? The doctor's on the Pauley Building on Madison. Then when it gets under way, turn it over to somebody else... then go back to Michelle, fresh and determined. Monty, you've got something there. I'll do it. I'll go and see this doctor right now. I think, I need a shave, I'll get it on the way. - Duke, your shoes! - I'll put them on later. Taxi! Oh... Taxi! - Razor? - No, we ain't got them yet. - Pauley Building on Madison. - Yes, sir. How's, um... how's business? Great! The crackpot that thought this deal up will probably be a millionaire. I hope so. Ah, "A serene mind in a healthy body. Never run away from your fears." The barber shops are going crazy. There may be a jurisdictional strike before we're through. Yeah. "Think of the problems of everyday life." "How to control your reflexes." One of the boys figured it out that you can save 90 hours a year... - ...just by shaving on your way to work. - Yeah. "Dangers of a wandering mind." Don't mean nothing to me, though. I gotta drive this thing. "Always concentrate on what you're doing." Always concentrate on what you're doing... Silly stuff. Here's your building, mister. - That'll be sixty-five... - Sixty-five. There you are. - What's the matter, isn't that enough? - You should have took a round trip. Round trip? Oh, no, thanks, don't wait. Half a mouth. I'm looking for a nerve doctor, Dr. Loring. - What's the matter? - 20th Floor. Thanks. See you next week, Mr. Cruickshank. Thank you, maybe much sooner than that. - Please let me by! - Well, go ahead, I'm not stopping you. You've set me back six months in my treatment. You're crazy. The only difference between us is I know it. I know it! I know it! I know it! - In here, please. - Oh, hello. - I'm looking for a doctor... - I know. In here. How did you know? When one's been a receptionist as long as I have, it isn't guess work. In here. Sit here. - Name? - Um... Oh, Duke Crawford. Age? What do you want to know my age for? - Now, just be calm, Mr. Crawford. - Calm? I'm always calm. Who do you think I am, a patient? Of course not. - Of course not. - Of course not. Thanks. This is ridiculous. Dr. Loring's very busy but I think we could crowd you in. Crowd me in? Look, you don't understand. I'm from the Montgomery Advertising Agency. It's imperative that I see Dr. Loring about the promotion of this book. My moustache! What's happened to it, it's gone! - I'm half naked! - Mr. Crawford, you must keep calm. Calm, who's calm? I gotta get a razor. No need. Use this. And here are the bandaids. I'll tell the doctor you're here. - Friday at the same time, Mrs. Wilson. - Goodbye. - The doctor will see you now, Mr. Crawford. - Oh, thanks for the shave. Perfume. You sound as if you disapproved. Lipstick too. Now and then. Tell me, do you use beauty cream, pancake pack, mascara and eye shadow? Occasionally, why? That's what I though, a woman. Are you careless about shaving? Huh? Do you keep putting off the haircut you need? Well, what about it? You don't like women, do you? Women mean nothing to me. Absolutely nothing. The most beautiful, glamorous, gor... gorgeous woman in the world could be, uh... Well, right here in this room and I could, uh... ...kiss her. Yes, yes, kiss her. And, um... absolutely nothing. That I'd like to see. See? I mean... see? Well... Where's, um... Dr. Loring? Here. Well, does it make any difference that purely by accident I belong to the opposite sex? No... I mean, no! However, I may as well tell you that I've found, um... ...women clients extremely difficult to do business with. With your approach I can well imagine. Sit down, Mr. Crawford. Thanks. Women are absolutely incapable of, um... ...separating business from emotion. - Really? - Really, they waste too much of a man's time. Well, then why didn't you send somebody else to discuss my book? You see, now that's what I mean. You're getting emotional already. But not at all, it's just that I have neither the power... ...nor the desire to change my sex. Oh, that's all right. Everybody knows that we've made women. For what particular purpose, Mr. Crawford? For what particular... Well, for, um... Well, for buying a book like yours, for instance. Now. First we'll arrange interviews for you with the press. Um, how's this for a slogan? Every day, in every way, let's live a little longer. - Have you read my book? - Well, I got the highlights. I'll read it through before I write the ads, it can't do any harm. It can possibly do you some good. - Excuse me, Doctor. - Yes, Dr. Field. Could you spare a moment to look at this X-ray? Certainly. Excuse me. I just wanted to tell you I... I was able to get two seats front row tonight. Oh, good. Um, do you mind if I smoke? Of course not. It's quite a major operation, don't you... ...think? - Cigarette? - No, thanks. It's warmer this way. Naturally, with winter only six months away. I guess I got dressed in a little bit of a hurry, I didn't notice. Is there any particular reason why I shouldn't wear my vest the way I want to? Of course not, Mr. Crawford, only please try not to get too excited. Excited? Who's excited? Somebody please answer the phone. If you'll excuse me. I'll leave you with your patient. He mistook me for a patient. - It didn't ring. - It didn't? - Do you drink, Mr. Crawford? - Thanks, Doc, not right now. - How do you sleep? - On my side. Well, to tell you the truth, I don't sleep very much, I got a lot of things on my mind. Business, you know. There's a chapter in my book that might help you. How to induce sleep by mental suggestion. Oh, that's great... Wait a minute. You're acting as though there's something wrong with me. Just because a guy gets a little ringing sensation in his ears now and then... is no reason to suppose that, um... That you will soon hear voices? Voices? Ha! That's ridiculous. It's so ridiculous that you should see a doctor. Now look, Doctor, You're supposed to be my client, not me yours. I'm afraid we're wasting each other's time. Maybe you're right. Women, humph! 3,253... 3,254... 3,255... 3,256... 3,257... Jump! Jump that fence! 3,257... 3,258... - Mr. Crawford. - 3,263... 3,264... Beat it! 3,265... Go on! 3,266... Are you still there, Madam Bennett? Yes, I'm still here, Duke, my darling. And you don't fool me a bit with that phoney British accent. This is Morton speaking in person, Madam Bennett. Where is Mr. Crawford, why doesn't he come to the phone? I'm sick of waiting. Now don't tell me he's asleep. He's not exactly asleep, Madam Bennett, but I don't dare to disturb him now. It might upset his arithmetic. - Arithmetic? - Precisely, Madam. - He's counting sheep. - Ah! I knew you'd understand, Madam. Good night. Operator! Operator! 4,010... 4,011... 4,011... Jump! Baaaa... jump! Meow yourself. And stop stomping around. Go and count mice or something! Sleep... Sleep, sleep, sleep... Sleep, Chapter 5. Chapter 5... Sleep. One of the best ways to induce... Yeah... Imagine yourself doing some strenuous type of labor... ...such as chopping down trees. Chopping down trees... Timber! Timber! Mr. Crawford! Now what is the idea of screaming at me in the middle of the night? I beg your pardon, sir, but I thought you called out. I may be mistaken, sir, but it sounded as if you cried, "Timber!" I did! It's an expression we lumberjacks use. I was chopping down some trees. Quite so, sir. Good night, sir. Sleep well, I trust. Mr. Duke Crawford's residence. Put him on at once, and don't you dare tell me he's still counting sheep. Oh no, Ma'am, he's been chopping down trees. Now, don't be impudent, Morton. Just tell him he'll talk to me if he knows what's good for him. I regret, I cannot comply with your request, Madam. Mr. Crawford badly needs a few weeks of sleep. He can sleep tomorrow night. Put him on at once. And don't you dare hang up on me or I'll keep calling all night until I get him. I understand, Madam. Is that you, Duke? I need something, I need something. Hot milk. Yeah, that'll do it, hot milk. Hot milk. This isn't hot milk. What's the matter with Morton anyway? - Morton! - "Is that you, Duke?" Morton. I know you're there, Duke Crawford. You'd better listen to me, Duke. I've waited for you long enough. You've gone your own way. Now you're going my way. I'll get you, Duke Crawford. I'll get you. Voices. Voices. Morton! Morton, get me a doctor! But don't leave me! Get me a doctor, don't go anywhere! You mustn't leave! I gotta have a doctor! I gotta have a doctor! I gotta have a doctor! Well, Doctor, I've just given your friend Crawford a thorough check-up. Oh, thank you. Well, he seems to be sound enough physically, doesn't he? Yes, but he's just the worst case of frazzled nerves I've ever seen. Once I have no excuse to carve him up, I'll turn him over to you. Mr. Crawford. Mr. Crawford! Dr. Loring will see you now. - Good morning, Mr. Crawford. - Good morning, Doctor. You're looking very well for a man that has nothing wrong with him. Nothing wrong? I'm only a wreck... Wreck! Well... We have to do something about that. Can't you give me a pill or something that will cure me quick, I haven't much time. You can stay a little time. Come out here. Isn't it a lovely morning? What's your favorite season? Spring, summer, fall, winter, which? Oh, I don't know. They're all the same to me. Look up, what do you see? - Trouble. - Trouble? No blue sky? I haven't got time for blue skies, I'm an advertising man. How would you classify your trouble? Big. Why don't you tell me about them? It's a contract. Advertising contract. Worth $100,000 to my company and I can't get renewed. I've been batting my brains out for months trying to get... ...a certain person to sign the renewal. Tell me about her, what's she like? - Oh, she... how did you know she's she? - It's just a guess. Well you guessed right. Michelle Bennett, my former fiancee. - "Aids to Beauty"? - Yeah, that's the one. Sometimes I think I've been too easy with her. Sometimes I want to barge in, twist her arm and make her sign it. Oh, I can't agree with you. If I put myself in Miss Bennett's place, I wouldn't like my arm twisted. There might be a few things about women you've overlooked. I doubt it. For instance? For instance? I'd like champagne, a waltz... Maybe a little caress. And then, in the still of the night, I wouldn't mind if a contract was barely mentioned... ...just in passing between the waltz and the caress. Ever been to the Pink Champagne Room? Pink Champagne, spells as magic. Sounds very lovely. Let's say tonight. Um, Mr. Crawford, I'm your doctor. You understand that, don't you? Yeah. I'll take Michelle to the Pink Champagne Room tonight. Yet I feel better already. When can I see you again? That'll depend upon your progress. - Yes? - Richard, would you come in a moment, please? Certainly, Jo. Yes, Jo? Richard, I felt I'd like to get all dressed up for a change. And go to a nightclub. The Pink Champagne Room, for instance. The Pink Champagne Room? I didn't know you liked that sort of thing. Neither did I. But maybe I'm just curious to see what goes on in such places. Good evening, Madame Bennett. Good evening, Henry. - This way. - Thank you. - Remember the signal? - Of course, Mr. Crawford. With your handkerchief, and then you pass it... Shh... that's fine, yes... Oh, Duke, you're so charming and eccentric. I just can't resist it you when you're like this. That's fine. Tonight you're going to have everything your little heart desires. If you don't see what you want, just ask for it, anything at all. - Then first I'd like some... - Pink champagne? - See? - Oh! Yes, that's fine. What's that? Oh, yes, just put it here. Oh, no that again? Well, it's my favorite drink, it sort of relaxes me. To you and me, my darling. And may this evening last forever. That would be quite a while... I mean, that's... that's wonderful, dear. - Well... I think I'd like to... - Dance? Except for shaving off your moustache, you haven't made a wrong guess yet. Yes, well I'll take some vitamins and grow another one. This is the way it should always be. Just you and me and a simple life. - Hello, Dukie. - Oh, hello... Hold me tighter, darling. If I hold you any tighter, I'll be dancing in back of you. Dr. Field. Oh, Phil, table 16, please. - This way. Something more interesting, dear? Oh, no, I just thought I saw a friend of mine. - A friend of ours? - No, it's... it's a doctor that I know. Oh. See someone you know? What, Richard? Oh, it's just one of my patients. Well, I'd hardly call this place a rescuer for a nervous disorder. Hm, in certain cases it might have some value. - He must be a fascinating dancer. - Well, that is, it's a little unusual, I just didn't think this doctor was the type who'd would come to a place like this. - Lovely doctor. - Certainly is. Michelle! Please don't act like this, I planned such a beautiful evening. - So that's your eye doctor. - Eye doctor, she's not an eye doctor. Strange, she uses them beautifully. I must keep you more healthy, dear. - Perhaps an apple a day? - But you don't... Excuse me. Now Michelle, if you just listen patiently, I can explain everything. - Please take this off... - Go ahead, I'd like to hear it. Did you meet her professionally or otherwise? Otherwise... professionally, with a book. I mean, I went to see her because she wrote a book, but... ...right after I saw her I had an attack. Oh, you poor lamb. What kind of an attack, heart? No, it was nothing like that, it was just a little something around my ears. - Oh, now she's an ear doctor. - She is not! She is not. It just so happens I can prove everything I say. - Can you? - I most assuredly can! Well then. Assure me, dear. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Oh, it's you. - Yes, it's me. Um, I'd consider... I'd consider it a great favor if you'd, um... ...join us at our table. Michelle's very anxious to meet you. In fact she's anxious to meet all my doct... my friends. Of course, I'll looking forward to meeting Miss Bennett. Well, that's wonderful! Michelle, I'd like to have you... I'd like to have you meet Dr. Loring. - Dr. Loring, this is Miss... - How do you do, Miss Bennett? - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, Doctor. Duke has told me so little about you. - Please sit down, Doctor. - Yes. Like one? Specialty of the house. - No, no, thank you. - Well! Oh... hello there. Oh, I'm sorry, old man. You must have just slipped my mind. Come and meet my friends. - Dr... - Field. Yes... Dr. Loring. - We've met. - Oh, yes, excuse me. - Dr. Bennett... Miss Bennett, this is Doctor... - Field. - My, another doctor. - Unfortunately. Well, won't you join us, old man, or do you have to hurry off? No, I haven't got to hurry off. Dr. Field and I are associates. - Oh, you are? - Yes, in medical practice. Well, how convenient. Duke told me you were an eye and ear doctor. I suppose you are nose and throat. I happen to be a surgeon. You... you got it all mixed up. Perhaps you can straighten it out for me, darling. Um, yes... Dr. Loring is sort of a neurologist. Also a famous author. Well, it's my job to make her famous and get her talked about. - That shouldn't be difficult. - No, no, we'll advertise. Mr. Crawford's only joking. But he is serious about wanting my book known to the public. How nice that you and Duke have so many interests in common. Of course, you being a neurotic. - Neurologist, not a neurotic. - And the best of her profession. I'm sure she must be. Just what is it you do when you practice your profession? Oh, I treat nervous disorders of various kinds. I'm curious to know what's supposed to be the matter with Duke. I really can't tell you that. Ethics, you know. Do let me guess, I'm awfully good at it. - Was it because he... - Michelle! If you must know... Dr. Loring is treating me... Treating me for a nervous breakdown. A nervous breakdown? Duke, darling, you didn't tell me. I didn't know. Well, I didn't know either. It just sneaked up on me. There's really no reason to be alarmed, Miss Bennett. All Mr. Crawford needs is rest and a few less business worries. There's nothing basically wrong with him. I'm no doctor, but I can vouch for that. I'm quite sure you can. With a beautiful and successful woman like you to help him, he'll be back to normal in no time. Now I can see that you really are a clever doctor. When I get my first complex, I'll bring it to you. I'm quite sure you'll never be bothered with a complex. Well... wouldn't it be nice if we all had something to eat? Speaking as a doctor, I can highly recommend an occasional meal. Mademoiselle, voil?! And I thought it was something to eat. Oh, Duke, what a wonderful surprise. Duke! Duke. Hm? Beautiful! Isn't it beautiful? - What is it? - Er, it's... sort of a fountain pen. Fountain pen? - What am I supposed to do with it? - Well, you can... You could write your name with it if you want to, even under pink champagne. It's a beautiful pen, all covered with jewels too. Yes, it's wonderful. Nothing but the best for you, Michelle. Oh, what's this? Oh, you don't have to read it... What is it, our marriage license, Dukie? Perfect. The Michelle Bennet Aids to Beauty, Limited, party of the first part and Montgomery Advertising Agency Incorporated, party of the second... Hm-hmm... What am I supposed to do with this? Sign it. Well! Shall we all have some pink champagne now and celebrate? No. Let's have a loving cup. All right. You shouldn't have done that! I beg your pardon. Answer the phone, answer the phone. Aloha! Duke, darling, speak to me, darling, speak to me! Ah, Hawaii! Here we find sun-drenched womanhood... ...in all of her pulchritude. - Brief intermission. - Yes. Come on. Let go of him, I'm taking him home with me. You've done enough for him, Miss Bennett. He's my patient and in my care from now on. To be or not to be. M.B.M.W.B. M.B... It's lovely here, isn't it? Could have been. Frankly, I'm not very fond of that corporate fellow. But he's my patient, Richard. There's something about this case that interests me. So I've noticed. But you must admit he has improved in the last few days. Then why don't you send him home? If I send him home now, he'll be back on the same old merry-go-round. And in no time he'll crack up again. Here he can stay in bed and rest. I won't even let him use the telephone. That about covers the Cozy Foam Covers campaign. Oh, tell Lewis that the Colger layout has to be finished by tomorrow night. Yeah, yeah... No, wait... Hold it, Monty, hold it. I gotta find that in my files. Yeah... just a second, just a second. Okay, here it is. The figure, we quote, no lace the cost will be 75,000, no coverage. Wait a minute, wait a minute, Duke. I can't hear you very well. Your voice sounds muffled. Can't you speak a little louder? You know how these country phones are. No, no, Monty, don't call me back. I don't like to disturb the doctors, they're having tea out in the front lawn. Why must we devote all our time to Crawford? You seem to forget we have other patients. I haven't any important cases in town at the moment. But why don't you go back and handle the office? And I'll stay here and keep an eye on Mr. Crawford. We'll both stay. I'll phone the office and tell Nurse Brady we'll be here another day or so. I want to speak to Miss Brady too. Why, that's funny. The phone's gone. Yeah. Well, don't let it die, Monty, it's a good idea. Yeah, all right, swell. Well, that takes care of everything here. Oh, don't forget to send orchids every day to Michelle Bennett. That'll keep her quiet till I get back. Yeah, okay... Who, the doctors? Well, one of them is sort of a stuffed-shirt Simon Legree type, the other's a female bloodhound who keeps probing my subconscious mind. How will I know when I'm cured? This place is driving me crazy, I spend most of my time cooped up in bed. Yeah... yeah... Wait a minute, I'm in a draft. Bye, Monty. It's funny, I don't know how the phone ever got in here, I was... I was just lying here sound asleep and all of a sudden I... ...found myself in a conversation. You seem much better, Mr. Crawford. You may use the phone whenever you like. And you needn't stay in bed any longer. Oh, I'm all uncovered. Don't be embarrassed, I'm only your doctor. Yeah, but he's not. Hiding the phone under the covers. Why, he's not even following your orders. - Why don't you drop his case? - You know I can't do that. His problem is a challenge to me. His problem is women. He hates them. I don't think so. One unfortunate experience has made him suspicious. It's more than that. Is it? I don't know why you waste your time with him. # I love a girl, but she doesn't love me # # That's loving's call # # That's speaking to me # - Can you swim? - Hm? Can you swim? What do you want to know for? If I fell in, would you save me? Yeah, I guess so. You're worth saving. I used to swim a lot when I was a kid. I was the most prominent swimmer in my school. Oh, you were? Yeah, I was the center of activity, they were always pulling me out. You are afraid of water? No, not necessarily. How can you fall out of a boat sitting way down in the bottom? Unless of course somebody stands up. Like this. - Beautiful moon. - Hm-hmm. You look at it long enough, you get kind of crazy. - That's an old superstition. - No, no, it's true. I feel a little foolish right now. A nice kind of foolishness. The kind I need a psychiatrist for. Watchya you looking at, mister? Don't bother me. Wanna buy some worms? We like digging night crawlers. It's too late for us to fish, but you can catch a lot of bass out there tonight. Don't you want to catch a bass out there tonight? Yes, I want to catch one and I'd like to beat his brains in! Now run along, run along! We're not getting anywhere. I thought we were. I thought we were. We could walk back to the lodge. I know. Or we could row back. I know. But I think it would be shorter to walk. I know. Could you... I think we'd better go back. I really think it's best. Duke! You said you hated women. Not me. We can't keep this up. We can try. But this is impossible. I'm your doctor and you're my patient. It's unethical. It's unethical, but it's nice. He is cured. Send him home. - Send him any place. - Did, did, did... Did anything happen? Yes. No. I don't know! How can I come down out of the clouds... ...and get my feet on the ground? Wonderful, wonderful... I want to congratulate you, Duke. You've done a good job on the Loring book. It's opened a whole new field for us. What do you think, Duke? I think... She's on the radio this afternoon, in Chicago. Who's in Chicago? - Her... yes... - Duke! Hello... huh? - What do you think, Duke? - Oh, she's wonderful. What? Oh, you mean Dr. Loring. Oh, how can any camera capture that splendid forehead? I know, I know, you've done a wonderful job getting the campaign started. Now I want you to drop Dr. Loring and let the staff take over. Oh, Monty, you just don't know her. You just don't... Drop Dr. Loring? - Mr. Montgomery, you can't mean that! - I do mean it. The Bennett account means as much now as it did when you went away. Bennett? Bennett, Bennett...? A lot of firms are pushing pretty hard for the Bennett account. Mr. Crawford! Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Montgomery. Mr. Crawford, you're missing the program, Dr. Loring's on the radio! Now, now, now, relax, Miss Adams. We never get anywhere by becoming excited, do we? No, we don't, do we? Radio? You have to answer the questions posed by our panel of readers. All right, are there any questions? Oh, Mrs. Lansworth has a question. Dr. Loring, one of the chapters in your book is called "Shortcuts to Mental Health". Do you actually believe it is possible for a person... ...to recover in a few days from a nervous breakdown? Yes, I've seen it happen. But you didn't write anything about examples like that in your book. - No, I... - Possibly you could cite just one case, Doctor. Well, I'd rather not. I don't think I'm sufficiently prepared to... Was the patient a woman, Dr. Loring? No, a man, um... A young business executive. But the case is not typical and I... Was he married, Dr. Loring? I'm thinking of a case that came to my attention recently. The recovery of Mr... X, we'll call him. He had been hearing telephones that hadn't rung. He had been hearing voices that weren't there. He was so confused he couldn't distinguish between the things... ...that were real and the things that were imaginary. Bringing this young man back to a clear-thinking attitude... ...was only a matter of a few days. And one night. He now is back at work... successful and... charming. Would you care to tell us how this was accomplished, Dr. Loring? Or is that a professional secret? What happened was what we call transference. - Transference? - Yes. Um... transference of affections. Oh, I see, then it's still a professional secret. You see, the patient was frustrated. He had fallen desperately out of love. Then he was exposed to someone who was attracted to him. She was the first person who seemed sympathetic and understanding. This person was his nurse. They walked and talked together. He kissed her. When the frustration disappeared, he was cured. I'm sure we're all very anxious, Doctor, to hear how this story turned out. Did the nurse fall in love with her patient? A nurse is trained to recognize transference... ...and is therefore imune to any romantic urge. I will say this is a very unhappy ending for a love story. A love story? I wasn't telling a love story. I was merely describing a medical case. Then this was a deliberate out and out treatment? Yes. In such cases the transference wears off very quickly... ...leaving no serious aftereffect. Well, I sincerely hope so for the sake of the guinea pig. - Guinea pig? - Guinea pig? Guinea pig?! Jo, you can't do it to me, I'll... I'll... You can't do it, I'll, I'll... I'm cured. Yes, yes, I'm cured. I see everything in the clear light of pure logic. - Mr. Crawford? - Bring me a guinea pig. What color? - What color what? - Guinea pig. I am not! I want the Bennett contract. Must be in your desk. An important paper, what's it doing in my desk? Good afternoon. Well! I see you got the orchids. Hm-hmm. Every time I see an orchid, it reminds me of you. - And pink champagne. - Hm-hmm. It was quite an evening... so they tell me. Of course you're wondering what's happened to me since. It's quite a story. Quite a story. Well, what I really came to say... Duke. Dukie. Why, I didn't mean it. Michelle. Oh, Michelle... Oh, are we gonna start that all over again? All right, it's all my fault. I made you throw things at me the way I behaved about the contract. Well, the con... contract doesn't mean a thing to me. It was only because of Monty and the way business at Montgomery... Michelle, where are you going? Michelle, will you listen to me? Michelle, li... You signed it? Yes, I signed it. Isn't that what you wanted? Well, yes, but... why now all of a sudden? I don't get it. Oh. - Now I get it. - Oh, no, you don't get it. Not until we're married. - Married? - Yes, married. - Why not? - Soon? Soon. Sleep, Jo. Go to sleep. You must sleep, you know. You tell other people how. Count sheep. No? Dig ditches? No? Chop wood? Chop wood. Chop wood... Good morning, Doctor. Good morning. Why don't you answer the phone? But it isn't ringing. Must have been another phone I heard. A call for you, Doctor. Oh... Then it really was the telephone. It's Mr. Crawford. - Good morning, Mr. Crawford. - Well, hello, Doctor. - How are you feeling? - Oh, I'm fine. - Haven't heard any bells lately. - Good. You've been doing a splendid job advertising my book. Oh, thanks, thanks. It's, um... it's on all the best-seller lists now. That's why I called, We've got a swell new radio date for you. - You have? - Yes. Your last broadcast was so sensational they want you to guest star on "Pay the Piper". Well, that's very interesting. Well, I have to tell you it is. It's got the highest Hooper rating in all the quiz shows. Of course it may not be dignified enough for a lady medic, but then, we advertising mugs haven't any more dignity than... than guinea pigs anyway. My secretary will arrange details with you. Oh, thank you. And I wish you both happiness. Both? Oh! You mean about the wedding. Yes. - That's on Tuesday. - Yes. I hope we will meet again someday. Oh, sure we will. Michelle and I want you to be our family doctor. As a matter of fact, we'll send our friends to you. Well... thanks for curing me. Bye, Dr. Loring. Goodbye, Mr. Crawford. - Yes? - Mr. Hopkins is here. Yes, Miss Brady. Send him in, please. Good morning, Mr. Hopkins. - Good morning. - How do you feel? Oh, much better this morning. Good. I slept last night for the first time in a month. Anything wrong, Doctor? Duke. Doctor, you don't look well. Should I call a doctor, Doctor? Doctor? Doctor. Miss Brady, ask Dr. Field to come in here right away. Duke... I mean, Mr. Crawford... I mean, Mr. Hopkins, Do you mind changing the appointment to later? I... I didn't sleep very well. I... Why don't you try what you prescribed for me? Exhaust yourself. I dug four ditches last night. And I started filling them up again, and then... Later, later. I... I... Some other time. Do you want to see me, Jo? Aren't you feeling well? Oh, it's nothing. Just a little tired. Jo, I've been a bit worried about you lately. You've been working much too hard. This advertising campaign for your new book and... everything. Yes, it has been a strain. You know... I could help you a great deal if you'd let me. Thank you, Richard. Why don't you cancel your appointments and drive out to Shady Lake this morning? A few days' rest will do you a world of good. I'll come up as soon as I can get away. Yes, I think that's a good idea. - I'll leave right now. - Splendid. Now don't worry about a thing. Just rest and forget all about the office and... Duke Crawford. Mr. Crawford is not my patient anymore. He's cured. All right, folks, let them out, stand back. Going up, please. Duke! Why, Duchess! It's a beautiful night. Yes. I mean the... The moon and... everything. Hm-hmm. Very, er... romantic. Hm-hmm. Jo... The time has come when I can remain silent no longer. I... I must speak. Yes? I said I must speak. Jo... Will you be my wife? Oh, darling, I've been waiting for you to ask me. Of course I will. Oh, I know a wonderful place up in the Minnesota woods... ...where we can spend our honeymoon. We'll go there right after the Doctors Convention. Oh... Richard! I... I thought I... Oh... excuse me. # I love a girl # # But she doesn't love me # Now, Mr. Fetherstone, just get rid of all this old furniture... ...and have the whole room done over to give it character. Perhaps Chinese Moderne. - Chinese what? - Moderne, darling. Oh. You'll love it, Mr. Crawford. It'll be perfectly charming. - Sure it will. - Glad you approve, darling. It's settled then, Chinese Moderne. Oh, Duke darling, must you always play that same silly tune? Can't we have a little boogie-woogie for a change? And you will have the whole apartment finished... ...by the time we get back from our honeymoon at Sun Valley? Have every confidence we will. Oh, Duke, not so loud, please. That's better, darling. Beg your pardon, Mr. Crawford, telephone. You just make some drinks, darling. I'll take care of the tiresome old phone call for you. - Shady Lake Lodge, sir. - Shady Lake... I'll take it. - Who is it? - A gentleman. Oh. Hello? Oh, hello there, Doctor. Crawford, I don't like the vulgar publicity stunts you're cooking for Dr. Loring's book. - You don't like them? - That's what I said. I will not allow Dr. Loring's standing as a physician... ...to be jeopardized by your cheap, silly tricks. So, if you don't drop them immediately, your contract will be cancelled. And who says so? I say so. I brought Dr. Loring to Shady Lake for a much needed rest. As her doctor and associate, I'm in full charge. Who do you think you are anyway, her husband? - Not yet. - Not yet?! But what I say goes. Well, not with me it doesn't. Put Jo on the phone, let her talk for herself. I'll do no such thing. Well then I'm coming out there right away and see what Jo has to say about it. If you try to disturb her, I'll gladly break your head. And don't think I can't do it. I was champion middleweight at college. Well, you'd better get back in condition fast because I'm on my way. Morton. Morton, call my car. Where are you going? To Shady Lake Lodge to sock Dr. Field in the nose. Field? Isn't he Dr. Loring's friend? That's right. And she's out there with him. And incidentally, I hate Chinese Moderne. - Morton! Call the car quickly. - Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry. Miss Bennett, that dress is only basted, it won't hold together. Oh, no! Oh, no... Oh, no! No... No... No, he isn't there. I know he isn't there. I know it. Jo, your pal Field... Jo, what's the matter with you? Look, your friend Field is waiting to stop me from seeing you. Like to see a good fight tonight? Fight? Jo! Oh, no, he wouldn't do that. He wouldn't do that. I must keep control of myself. I mustn't see things that aren't there. I must keep control of myself. Jo! Two days' rest, that's all I need. Jo, it's me, Duke, remember? Hm, remember? I never forget. It's no use, I still see him. Oh, so that's it. Seeing things. I'm not here at all, hm? No, I'm all alone. Just my nerves. I'll be all right in a day or so. Tell me, do you just see me or do you see all sorts of things? You, just you. Everybody looks like you. Only this is the first time... ...nobody looks like you. Well, that's very interesting. You're all alone and ready for a good night's rest, aren't you? Of course it's a normal reaction in cases of this sort. Nothing to worry about. This marriage to Michelle will be very good for me. Very good for me. Well, naturally, since I'm not here, I can't be blamed for doing this. Talk about imagination. Even if he isn't here, I like it. Oh! - Where are they? - They? Yes! Duke and Jo. Why, she's asleep, he hasn't shown up yet. - He left ahead of me. - Say! You don't think... You don't know Duke. Well, if he's here, we'd better stop them before they do anything foolish. What's foolish about it? Go away, will you? Jo, your nerves. Her nerves nothing, her nightgown. Drop her, Crawford, or I'll slug you silly. Stop that while I'm talking to you! Duke! Someone answer that phone. Did you hear something ring? Hm-hmm... - Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes
