[electronic arcade sound playing] [girl] Come on. [melodic indie pop music playing] [girl 2] There's this tradition at my school. Every year, on the Saturday after graduation, the seniors of Kiffney-Brown Prep break into the school's bell tower, - party at the top... - Whoo! ...and take turns ringing the bell for an hour. - [bell ringing] - [all cheering] It's a rite of passage that everyone looks forward to all year. [cheering continues] To mark the end of the hour, they TP the tower. [all] Two, one! [cheering] [cheering fades] [indistinct chattering] It's actually kind of beautiful. It's not supposed to be beautiful. It's supposed to be a prank. Right. But, like, it happens every year, so... So it's essentially school-sanctioned, right? Like, if they wanted to stop it, they could, which is fine, for a tradition. But I mean, like, as a transgressive act, it's faulty. Right? - If it's faulty, what are you doing here? - Yeah. I mean, I... I wanna do it, I... I was just pointing out... Anyway, there's no rule that says that all seniors have to participate, so... Come on. I wanna get a good spot at the top. [melodic indie pop music continues] Shit. [girl 2] If this were an isolated incident, it'd be fine. [boy] Let's go! [all cheering] [girl 2] But the truth is, I do this all the time. Which is why, instead of celebrating at the top of the bell tower with my classmates, I'm at home with my mom and her colleagues, a bunch of old people. [woman] Nothing is gonna change when we don't recognize a woman merits our attention unless she's married to or having sex with a more famous man. And that is why I'm never getting married again. [group laughing] - What are your plans for the summer? - I'm spending it with my father in Colby. She thinks that they're gonna bond. - Mom. - [tongue clicks] It's a judgment on your father, not you. [chuckles] I'm saving money for college. I'm gonna work in my stepmom's store. And what was the name of that place? Oh, um... [tongue clicks] Cupcake Glitter Breast Implants. [group laughing] [woman 2] Good for you, Auden. A summer at the beach sounds like the perfect reward for all your hard work. I offered for her to be my research assistant, but she chose this. [Auden] I know my mom doesn't understand why I wanna go to Colby, but it's like I only know how to be one kind of person here. I've never done anything you can't read about on my transcript. [restaurant guests laughing] But maybe if I go to Colby, I can be someone else. Someone different. Or it will be exactly the same, and I can't change. I don't know, but I'm willing to bet the summer on it to find out. ["To the East" by Electrelane playing] [woman 3 squeals] Auden, hi! I'm just calling again to say how capital E excited your dad and I are to see you this summer. Let me know the second you think you're gonna arrive. Call me from the Colby sign... No, call me before the Colby sign. Call me every ten minutes because I cannot wait! Wait, you know, it's Heidi, right? It's me. It's Heidi, your stepmom.

Oh my God, no, Auden. I'm so sorry. I thought you were your father, and I... and I just got her to sleep, and... [sighs] ...I totally forgot what day it was. - It's okay. - I had everything planned. Banners, balloons. I even bookmarked ideas for a "Welcome to Colby"- themed brunch. I swear to God, all last week, I kept thinking to myself, "This is your stepdaughter. This is Thisbe's sister." "You missed her graduation, so you better get your ass in the kitchen and make this welcome special." Is my dad here? - Oh, he's in his office. - [Thisbe crying] He's always in his office. - [man] Yeah? - Dad? Oh! Hey! - There she is. Come on in, come in. - Hey. And before you say anything, I know. It's a disaster area. But I bet you remember that from when I was working on Narwhal. Gotta say, Dad, in my memory of that time of our lives, the status of your office cleanliness is not exactly what comes to mind. [laughs] Yeah, 'cause your parents were breaking up. Something about that. Hey, are ya hungry? I know a great place for onion rings. Really? Yeah. I'd... I'd love to. [chuckles] Great, great. Head out to the boardwalk. You can't miss it. It's called, uh, Last Chance. Here you go. - You're not coming? - I wish I could, but I'm really swamped. But if you wouldn't mind bringing me back a burger, that'd be, uh, that'd be great. They have those caramelized onions, so good. Yeah, of course. - Thanks, Aud. - Yeah. - I'm so glad you're here. Aw. - Yeah, me too. [chuckles] - Great. - Okay. [Thisbe crying] [melodic indie pop music playing] [gasps] Oh my God! Auden... [chuckles] ...you snuck up on me there. I'm gonna go for a walk. Do you need anything? - You should go to the Tip. - The Tip? Yeah. It's where all the cool, young people hang out. Super fun. - Can't miss it. - [Auden] Right. - Don't be nervous. - I'm not. Oh, when you get there, ask for Maggie. She's my favorite. She's great. Cool. Uh, thanks. You're young. Have fun.

Um, wait, I'm sorry. Is everything okay? [Auden] Yeah. Yes. Um, it's just... Have you ever done something to be a different version of yourself, but once you're in the middle of it, you think like, "Wow, this is so not me"? - You're gay? - Oh, no. I mean, I don't think so. It's all a spectrum, right? - But I was more talking about... - [shushes] It's okay, all right? Look, I'm not offended. You're figuring this out, and that's chill. But if you're not feelin' it with me, you're probably not feelin' it with dudes because all the honeys love the Jake. [chuckles] Oh, that's so cool. Um, I gotta go. But thank you. I'm sorry. Thank you. So... Oh, um, do you by any chance know where I could find someone named Maggie? - Are you being serious? Is that a joke? - What? No. - Never mind. Sorry. - [scoffs] [girl 3] Oh! Here she comes. Looks like they're done. [chuckles] But, like, I'm fine. - [girl 1] You're okay? - [girl 3] I'm fine. They had a great time, and I am fine. I'm doing good. I'm not. - [girl 2] Who is that? - [girl 1] Never seen her. - [girl 3] I don't know her. - [girl 1] You're fine? [girl 3] I'm fine. I'm great. [melodic indie pop music playing] [sighs] [tire screeches] [music fades] - [father] I told you to get a nanny. - [Heidi] I'm not asking for the world. I'm asking for 20 minutes so I can brush my teeth and shower. - Yeah, but it wasn't 20 minutes. - Oh my gosh... [Heidi] Auden? Is that you? Hi. [Heidi] Aw. - Good morning, sleepyhead. - [Auden] Morning. You just wake up? - Yeah, it's kind of unusual for me. - [Heidi] Oh. - Yeah, I better get back to it. - [Heidi] Mm-hmm. - Morning, kiddo. - Morning. [Heidi chuckles] - Coffee. - [Heidi] Mm-hmm. I didn't mean to make you feel guilty about sleeping in. It's just that I have zero sense of time right now. - [Heidi laughs] - It's okay. So, you ready for your big day? - Your first day at the store, silly. - Oh. [chuckles] And don't worry. You don't need a schedule as long as everything gets done, which I know it will, with you being Little Miss Honor Society. Don't think I don't brag about you to everybody. - [giggles] - [chuckles] Wow. [Heidi] I'm so excited for you to meet the crew. Do you like flamingos? - Aren't they the best bird? - They're cool. And voilà. Welcome to my nirvana. - It's great. - Would you mind? - Oh, yeah, of course. - Oh, thank you. Okay. Where are my ladies? - [girls squealing] - Oh my God! - [Heidi laughs] - [girls gasp] [girls in unison] Aw. [girl 2] She's so beautiful. [girl 1] OMG, her eyelashes. [girl 3] Are you dying over how cute she is? Oh, I missed you girls. Well, don't worry about a thing here because we've got everything covered. The Booty Berry perfume came in, and people are freaking out about it. And the lock-and-key necklaces have been restocked three times. [gasps] Did I tell you, or did I tell you? - Did I tell you? - Yep. - I told you. I told you. - [girl 3] You told us. [Heidi gasps] Oh! And this. Why are you hiding in the corner? - Sorry. - This is who I've been telling you about. My genius stepdaughter, Auden. Auden, this is Esther, Leah, and Maggie. Oh, we've met. - We have? - At the Tip. You know my ex, Jake. - Oh, yeah. - Oh, good. Now I know you girls will take Auden under your wing and show her all the spots and make her feel super comfortable here in Colby, right? - Mm-hmm. - [Heidi] Good. [sighs] All right, I better get the little one home before she has to eat. Can I just tell you, my nipples... [groans] [girls laughing] But I love that you four are a new little crew. So much fun. [chuckles] - You good? - Yeah. - Good. Okay. - [Auden] Mm-hmm. Love you guys. [kissing] Bye. - [Esther] Let me get the door. - Okay, let's go! Let's go into the world. We got this. Okay! Here we go!

Just thinking about what you said, and I think you should do it. Do what? Think of a bunch of stuff you haven't done, and just start doing 'em. It could be, uh, like a quest. [both laugh] - A quest? - Yeah, yeah. That sounds ridiculous. - What? What is ridiculous about it? - [laughs] I don't know. I tried to be a different person once this summer, and it was comically bad. Yeah? Did it happen at the Tip? Why do you ask? In my experience, most comically bad scenarios take place at the Tip. I mean, with a name like that... - How could they not? - Yeah. [both laugh] Uh, I'm just up here. Will you think about it? The quest? You seem awfully invested in my life for a stranger, Eli.

Yeah, how sick. - [Eli] Did you go to prom? - [Auden] No. [Eli] Why not? I guess I'm just not one of those people who thought high school is supposed to be this, like, big party. I was more interested in working hard so the rest of my life could be great. Okay, but come on. I mean, even the kids who hate high school still go to prom, unless, uh, you're too cool for it, which is the vibe I'm getting from you. It's not that. [chuckles] It's, I guess, um, I got stood up. Oh God. I'm sorry. That's terrible. No. Oh my God. Please don't feel bad. I was supposed to go with this guy, Jason. He was just like a lab partner. It was a friends' thing. And... Well, he got invited to a conference at Duke, so... It was, like, so not a big deal. I couldn't care less about prom. [Eli] Huh. Really? Are you sure? Okay, fine. Uh, maybe the one thing that sucked a little was the dress. - The dress? - Yeah. I was downtown one day, going to used bookstores, and I wandered into this store, and there was this dress on a mannequin that was just, like, so cool. Um... [chuckles] You know, if I regret anything, it's not being able to wear the dress. But prom itself? Yeah, pass. Did you bring it to Colby with you? No. No? Where would I wear something like that here? [chuckles] Anywhere. What? Yeah, wear it to, uh, skip rocks. Wear it to drink Cokes. I mean, it doesn't matter where you wear it if it's about the dress, right? I guess. [Eli] Hmm. You know, it's a shame you didn't bring that dress because it would have been perfect for the quest. Eli, we're not doing the quest. [chuckles] Oh, Auden. Of course we are. What about you? We've been talking about me this whole time. [Eli] Yeah, well, that's because you're a lot more interesting than I am. Stop deflecting. Your turn. [Eli sighs] I don't know. Sometimes I feel like all I've ever done is goof off. I even made a career out of it. - I mean, for a minute. - How'd you do that? Just, uh, bike stuff. Whatever. You know, now it's like, what does it all add up to? Just, uh, some grainy clips on YouTube? Bunch of stupid stories? I think that everyone deserves a do-over if they want it. You know? Wish I could have a do-over. A do-over for what? [Eli clears throat] You, uh... You didn't win, but it's a very respectable performance, I will say. Can I keep it? Just in case anyone ever asks if I've played mini-golf, it'd be good to have proof. 'Course. Yeah, gotta have proof. [melodic organ music playing] I hate when it rains. - Can't be a beach day every day. - Why not? I'll go get the ponchos. - [thunder rumbling] - [knocking at door] - Sorry, the ponchos are back here. - Oh. I can get them. Oh my God. These are awful. [Maggie] When you say stuff like that, you act like you're speaking for everyone, when really, you're only speaking for yourself. Oh, I... Um... You're right. Sorry. [Leah] Auden, you have a visitor. [box thuds] Mom. Hi. Auden. Hello. [chuckles] [mother sighs] Can we help you find something? I'm gonna wait for you outside. [chuckles] Here. I know what you're gonna say, but come on, you'll get soaked. Thanks. [boys indistinctly chattering] Have you sampled the local cuisine? - What? - Where would you like to have lunch? Um, there's a place on the boardwalk with good onion rings. How charming. [soft piano music playing] So, how's it going? Bonding with your father? Good. I mean, he's kind of busy. He's just working really hard. The thing about your father is, uh, he enjoys the performance of working arguably more than he does the actual work. And Heidi? Heidi's nice. Of course she's nice. Women like her are always nice. They have to be. It's part of the job description. [laughs] Poor thing. She must be exhausted, caring for the infant all by herself. Dad helps. Auden, who do you think you're talking to? [mother chuckles] Ah. Oh! That's quite the raincoat. - [laughs] - Okay. Just say it, Mom. Say what? Whatever it is you wanna say. [sighs] You'll have to forgive me if I find it alarming how easily you've adapted to the world of your father's new wife. That's insane. I'm... I'm exactly the same as I've always been.

Maggie, hi. Your mom's kind of intense, huh? Yeah, you could say that. She's a legend as a professor, but it must be hard to be her daughter. You know who my mom is? Of course. I almost went to the U just so I could take her classes. But I couldn't turn down Defriese. You're going to Defriese? I'm going to Defriese. [chuckles] I know. Heidi told me. I'm starting to understand why, when you saw me, you thought, "Wow, I hate her." Actually, when I first saw you, I thought, "I'm so depressed that cool, hot girl's hooking up with my boyfriend." - Yeah. - I didn't form an opinion until later. [both laughing] Fair. That is fair. But what wasn't fair was being so hard on you about the Jake stuff. I mean, you didn't even know me. Yeah, but I still feel bad. It's okay. He's a tool. I'm not gonna say anything. [Maggie laughs] It's okay. I've come to accept it. But at least he's, you know, a hot one. [both laughing] I'll give you that. He's... he's a hot tool. [both laughing] Okay, come on. I promised Heidi I would show you around, and I've been delinquent with my responsibilities. Esther and Leah are sitting up there if you wanna head over. - Where are you going? - I'll be up in a bit. - Hey. - [Auden] Hey. She roped you into this too? No worse than when you roped us into going to Ossify to watch that guy recite his shopping list over a drumbeat. Why did Maggie wanna come here? Why do you think? Is she into one of those guys? [Esther] You'll see. Wait, what? What's happening? This... this is a joke. You guys are playing a joke on me. She's... This is... this is Maggie. - This is Maggie. - I know. We've seen this before.

Are Jason and Carlos gonna be here? Are you embarrassed? ["Noisy" by Noga Erez playing] How do you know these people? Well, we don't know all of them. Some we grew up with. Some are alums who come home for the summer. Some Eastern Europeans who come work at the restaurants during our busy season. Why Eastern Europeans? I don't know. It's just always been like that. Speaking of which... Yeah, I'm from Colby. Where'd you say you're from? Uh, Latvia? - How long was that drive? - [laughs] Ugh. I don't understand why he feels the need to declare himself unofficial ambassador of Colby to every new girl in town. Oh, no offense. - No. It's okay. - [Leah] Come on. We don't need to watch.

I'm just curious because we're kind of friends. Never mind. Unless you think he might come tonight? [Maggie] You wish. He never comes to stuff like this. Not anymore, at least. Not since Abe. Abe. Right. - Has he told you about Abe? - Yeah. No. Okay. So Abe was Eli's best friend. Eli and Abe both did street BMX. Probably because that's what Clyde was most into, and they both idolize him. But anyway, they were amazing. Both sponsored, won crazy competitions, in a league of their own. Everyone thought that after they graduated, they would move to, like, Barcelona or Berlin. One of those European cities with great streets for riding. Is that what Abe did? No. Abe died. He and Eli had gone to New York for the weekend for this big invitational. On their way home, only, like, 20 miles outside of Colby, a drunk driver hit them. Eli was driving. After the funeral, he totally shut down. Now he's like a ghost. Gave up his sponsorship, stopped riding. Works in the back of a shop doing repairs and never hangs anymore. Which is why it was so surprising to us when he started hanging out with you.

What? - [woman in movie] Westley! - You hate it? No, giant rats are cool. [Auden chuckles] Okay, hold on. [radio shuts off] So what was your favorite movie in the fourth grade? The Piano? No. - [chuckles] - I don't know. I liked Bye Bye Birdie. Did you? Bye Bye Birdie the musical? It's for kids. [laughs] Yeah. - Yeah, kids born in 1960. - [laughs] What about you busting out the Jane Campion reference? My mom would be so proud of you. Yeah, well, when you don't sleep, you watch a lot of movies. - And eat a lot of pie... - Mm-hmm. - ...drink a lot of coffee... - [chuckles] Two nocturnes. Guess that's why we're pals. Pals. [both chuckle] But seriously, why don't you sleep? I'm just a night owl, I guess, you know? What about you? Same question. Same answer. Nocturne, night owl. Nah. You have a story. I can tell. If I had to pull it down, I guess it's that when my parents were still married, they used to wait for me to fall asleep before they would start fighting. And I thought if I didn't fall asleep, they can't fight. I mean, I was wrong, obviously. I'm sorry. That's... No, please don't be. I'm not like one of those kids who's defined by her parents' divorce. If anything, my life was probably better because they got divorced. Whose parents are still married anyway? Mine are. Right. [Eli chuckles] But I mean, I'm sure you had other stuff to deal with. [pensive music playing] Hi, what's up, everybody? Um, my name's Eli Stock. That doesn't matter. You don't need to know who I am. You know who this is right here. Your boy Abe. - You know him as Abeonimable. - Abeominable. [Eli laughs] - [Abe] Yes, sir. - [laughs] [Eli] Did you do the 360 bar today? [Abe] Yeah, did a 360 bar, aka Truck Driver. - [Eli] First try too. Nice, homie. - [Abe] First try. - Almost flipped the pedal, but I saved it. - [Eli] You always fall first try. [Abe] Always. Yeah, man, what's up with that? - Get out of here, bro. - [Eli laughing] - What? I don't even fall half the time. - Hey, be sure to check my boy out, okay? All right? He's, like, my best friend. - [Abe] Yeah. - [Eli] His hair is disgusting. He's never washed it a single time. He's my homeboy. He's so cute. [Eli, Abe laugh] Big Abe, stop playing, man. Stop playing. - [both laugh] - [computer lid slams shut] [exhales] - [Thisbe crying] - [Heidi shushing] Hey, everything okay? Do you need anything? I'm trying to get her to take a bottle so your dad can help with feedings. Hey, babe, I think she'll take this more easily from you. When I'm here, she just... she just wants the boob. [chuckles] Oh, honey, I wish I could, but I was gonna take Auden to lunch. - What? - Today? Yeah. Aren't you the one that said we should spend time together? - Yeah, but I mean... - So, what do you say? - Shrimp basket? - Um... [Thisbe crying] [Auden] Um... Great. [chuckles] - Great. - Okay. All right. [Auden] Do you think it's okay we left just like that? Heidi seemed a little, like, strung out. No, she's fine. I think that's just what new motherhood looks like. Was it like that for you and Mom? No, your... your mother and Heidi are completely different. As far as I can tell, all women go nuts with a newborn. But men don't? I think that's why she's frustrated about the book. It's like I told her when she said she wanted to get pregnant. I only have these three months before classes start to get it finished. We just gotta put our head down and get through it. Yeah. How is it coming along? [Robert] It's grueling. Very painful, difficult, but beautiful too. As you know from Narwhal, a lot of my work deals with undiscovered trauma that we carry from our parents. Auden, you're so lucky you don't have that to deal with, at least not from me. Right. Hey, um, you know, I'd love it if you read the draft. You want me to do that? Yeah, it'd be great to have a young person's perspective. You know how youth-obsessed our culture is these days. [groans] You just brought that with you to lunch? - I mean, a brilliant young person... - [Auden] Right. Of course. I carry it with me everywhere. You think you can read it? Yeah. I mean, of course. I'd love to, Dad. [Robert] Excellent. If you can get me notes by Friday, that would be really great. - My dad's book. - Looks long. Three years ago, I would have been so excited to have him trust me with it, but I just realized I have absolutely no desire to read this. My dad's always trying to get me to go fishing with him. My dad would probably use me as bait. Don't forget to dance at 6:00, okay?

Uh, but that's never gonna happen. Why not? I only wanted to go because a bunch of pro BMXers live out there. Pro BMXers like you? Isn't that what you told me before? That you made a career out of bike stuff? Yeah. Yeah, but, you know, I'm retired. - You're retired? - Yeah. At 20?

Yeah, Eli used to love hot dog parties. Wallace's parents go out of town every year on the Fourth, and we take over their house. We didn't come up with the name, which I'll grant you is terrible. The name doesn't matter. What matters is you showing up with Eli so that, as your friends, we can assess the situation. Can I admit something to you guys? I've never really had friends like this before. See, you say that, but I don't get it. I mean, there were people at our school way more awkward than you, and even they had friends. - [Auden chuckles] - I mean, look at Esther.

You're gonna quit on your family, again? Because it's hard? Is that what you think I did, Auden? That I... that I quit on you? I don't know what I think.

Eli, come on, the quest isn't real. The quest... It's a joke. It's... Just like this summer, you've been pushing me to be this whole new version of myself. - But you're too scared to be who you are. - Okay, and who am I, Auden? Who exactly do you think I am? You tell me. Are... are you gonna be someone who ambles around Colby, working in the back of a bike shop? [Eli] Ambles around, okay. Or are you going to ride professionally again, or move to Europe, or go to Barcelona? - That's what you were saying. - I think I'm understanding you perfectly. I get it. What... what do you get? I don't understand. Uh, let's see. Colby sucks. - And Auden West is too good for Colby. - That's not fair.

I was gonna open up a boutique there on the Lower East Side, but I decided I would wait until something came on the market that I truly loved. And it did. Clementine's.

[Leah] Who was invited? There was no invite. I guess. - [Maggie] Why aren't you over there? - [Leah] What are you doing? Talk to him. [Maggie] Just go talk to him. Okay, but what if he thinks it's weird that I'm here? Oh yeah. 'Cause guys hate when girls they like show up to watch them win.

[tongue clicks] I'm really sorry about what I said the other day. I didn't mean it. You did, but It's okay. You know, I needed to hear it. Look. I miss the hell out of Abe. I thought that if I stopped thinking about it and... if I gave up doing all the things he loved that it would just go away, but it only made it worse 'cause, you know... [chuckles] ...all the things he loved were the things I loved too. [sobs] He was just the best, man. I loved that kid so much. [sobs, exhales] I wish you two could have met. He would have loved you. So do I. And I'm... I'm sorry too. You know, if I pressured you into doing anything you didn't wanna do... Oh, no, no, no. I... I wanted to do everything I did. Okay, good. [Auden] That morning, me freaking out, it wasn't about you, or us, or the night before. It was just some stuff with my parents. Turns out I'm not as over all of it as I thought. It's okay. I get it. Okay, well, enjoy tonight. - You earned it. - Thanks. [soft melodic music playing] [breathes deeply] [Heidi] You know, it's the craziest thing. Both my girls slept through the night. [Robert] Auden, do you know anything about that boy on our lawn in a tuxedo? Oh. Hey. Hey yourself. You know, we, uh, came up with a new name for the bike shop. "Abe's Bikes." What do you think? I love it. Okay, good, 'cause you gave me the idea, so... Nice tux. - Oh, this old thing? - [laughs] Where you goin' all dressed up? I don't know. I was thinking maybe I'd skip rocks, drink Cokes. [Auden chuckles] Why, is that something you'd be interested in? I mean, I'd love to, but I don't have anything to wear. Right. It's a real shame you didn't bring that dress to Colby with you. [melodic indie pop music playing] Give me ten minutes. [Eli clears throat] Wow. - [chuckles] - [Eli chuckles] Wow. - [Eli] So this is it, huh? - Yeah.

[music ends] So are you sure you don't miss the prom part? Well, okay. Today aside, maybe I was a little hard on prom. Maybe there's something nice about getting dressed up and dancing with your friends to mark the end of something. [Maggie] I'm so glad to hear you say that. - Hey! - [girls laugh] Wait, what's going on? When Eli told us about his plan, I said, "Are you kidding?" "If my friend has never been to prom, she's gonna get a real one." The theme is Beach Bash. We thought it was best to work with what we had. Is this for real? Do you hate it? I so don't hate it. [chuckles] [Maggie] Hello? - [laughs] - Oh! [Auden] Thank you. All right, just 'cause you're the catalyst of this thing doesn't mean you don't have to help. Get to work.
