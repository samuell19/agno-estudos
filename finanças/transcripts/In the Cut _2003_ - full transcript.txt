Depends on the context. Pubic hair or marijuana. It's a noun. And "Virginia"? Vagina. As in, "He penetrated her Virginia with a hammer." [LAUGHS] Yikes. Slang is either sexual or violent. Or both. But it's witty. I think it's really witty. [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] How are you? MAN: Hi. How are you? Why didn't you say hi? I nodded. Are you happy when you wake up? No. Hey, there was a petal storm out here this morning. I saw that. I thought it was a snow storm. I thought I was dreaming. PAULINE: No, there's two stores we should go to in Soho. It would not take very much for me to make you look very good. You are sabotaging a fucking incredible figure, baby. Yo! Is that your student? It looks like he wants to eat you. They all flirt.

Cornelius, are you trying to tell me that you need an extension? [LAUGHTER AND CHATTERING] No. Look, I came to tell you I made a discovery. See, I discovered I can call John Wayne Gacy and hear him talk hisself, Miss Avery. Really? Dead murderers have their own phone lines? He wasn't no murderer. Look, there be a... a website for serial killers, you know, past and present. He recorded and explained himself how he didn't kill no 33 boys. Look, I got a radar for the truth, and I'm going to write how I know that. This paper's not supposed to be about you, Cornelius. That's the point of the whole assignment. You said that every word a writer writes, even the commas and shit, got to be a reflection of him or her. That we be doing this writing shit to express our vision. You know I got vision.

Not in my apartment. You got some place I could put it out? Thanks. Uh, Miss Avery, there was a homicide in your neighborhood on the 15th. That'd be Saturday the 15th, last Saturday between 12:00 and 2:00 a.m. Her body, or part of her body, to be exact, was found in the garden outside your window. [PHONE RINGING] That's why I wanted to talk to you. You know, just in case you saw or heard anything unusual. [ANSWERING MACHINE BEEPS] No. No, nothing unusual. [ANSWERING MACHINE BEEPS] Frannie. It's John Graham. Are you there by yourself? I don't think you're there by yourself. Why did you lie to me? Doesn't it mean anything to you that we slept together twice?

My ex-wife had long hair, then she cut it. So, um... you don't remember seeing anything? Hearing anything? Oh, my pen? It's fake. It's a cop thing. You don't remember anything? Didn't see anything? Didn't hear anything? No cries in the night? No. I don't remember seeing or hearing anything unusual, and I sleep with the windows open. Mm-hmm. You do that a lot? Can you tell me how it happened? Her throat was cut and then she was disarticulated. Here's my card. My number's there. If you remember anything, give me a call, all right? Do I know you from someplace? I don't know. Thanks.

Now, you think about it, all right? Now, take a walk. Miss? Oh, Miss? Miss? How you doing? Excuse me. Can I talk to you for a minute? Am I supposed to get in? You want to talk on the street? Never think it's a good idea putting your business on the street. You know what I mean? I'll get it. This is my partner, Detective Rodriguez. Hi. How you doing? How do you do? What is this? Coffee. It's a half a cup. Take it back. Black coffee, he gives me a half a cup of coffee. What, does he expect... ...problem with the coffee... How long is this gonna take? ...this morning? I'm sorry? How long is this gonna take? Are you in a hurry? Where you going? My friend's. Half sister's. We'll give you a lift. So, what do you do? I teach. You teach what? Hey, you get a chance to run those prints? Teach what? English. You know what an isthmus is? This must be my lucky fucking day. Now, what the fuck? You ran the prints? Yeah. And? Nada. Nothing. Look, the reason Detective Malloy and I thought you might be able to help is the bartender... Luther Wilker? Yeah. At the Red... Turtle. He said you were there on the night in question, the 11th. He's got a good memory. No, we have your credit card receipt. That look familiar? That's right. I was at the Red Turtle with one of my students. One of your students? Cornelius Webb, but it was early. It was 3:30. I was there for a short time, then I went home. Cornelius Webb? Is that with two Bs or not two Bs? W-E-B-B. And you were in the front room the whole time? Yes. Are you sure? Didn't I just say so? MALLOY: You didn't happen to see a Caucasian girl, mid-20s? Not too tall. Good-looking. Wouldn't you say? What? She was good-looking? She wasn't bad looking. Yeah, but, she... Well, did you? What is this about, exactly? Listen, Miss Avery, the deceased was seen in the Red Turtle the same night that you were there. Seeing how you were there and everything, maybe you wouldn't mind taking a look at a few pictures, you know? Sometimes you see something you don't remember. Take a deep breath. This one's kind of graphic. ♫ Come here, my love ♫ [HUMMING] Well, do you recognize her? No. ♫ Here in my heart ♫ [HUMMING] Thank you. Hey. Can't figure you out. What do you mean?

I'm looking good? You are looking good. Is Pauline home? Hey, sorry. Oh, baby, I think she could be up, she could be down. You know, go check the bar, baby, okay? Hey, hey, look. That's cute. Is it real? Of course it be real. Are you crazy? I don't let no psycho killer mess with my girls. He be dead. Bye, baby. I make sure no one fuck with my goddamn girls. What is it? What's wrong? It's so humiliating. Is it the doctor? Oh... Oh... Do you want to go up? Mm-hmm. Okay. Thanks, guys. Oh, well... Good luck. Hope you feel better. What happened? His receptionist called me with a referral to another doctor. He cancelled our appointment. Was this after you had sex with him? He's right. He shouldn't have had sex with me. I mean... of course he's right. Do you ever think about just imagining sex? What do you mean? Just thinking about the doctor and not making appointments, just... just not really trying to have sex with him in reality. That's kind of boring. I mean, I do... I do restrain myself. You know, I just... I got so enthusiastic when I would think about him and it confused me, because I think enthusiasm is a good thing, you know? I mean, I think about...

That's a good reason to kill your wife. I mean, of all the reasons I can think of. He wasn't gonna kill her, lady. He was just trying to scare her. ["A BLOSSOM FELL" PLAYING] That was his San Juan Man of the Year award, you know?

It's just a scrape. Did you get a look at him? No, he was wearing a mask. Anything stand out? Like, um... a smell, rings on his fingers, watch, shoes, anything? How was that girl killed? Who? The girl who was killed at the Red Turtle. Angela Sands? She wasn't killed at the Red Turtle. You're getting confused. What is disarticulation, exactly? Listen... it's not likely that your assailant's the murderer, babe. It's much more likely he was after your wallet. So you're not gonna tell me how she was killed? You really want to know? Her throat was slit with a straight razor. He was trying to take her head, maybe for a souvenir. We found another, uh... dismembered female body last June along the river. I think it's the same killer. Ritchie don't, but I do. Go over it again. No. Show me. Come here. Show me. He came from behind you? I don't know. Did you turn? Uh, he just... he grabbed... he grabbed my head in his arm. He had his arm around my neck. So he must have come up from behind you, then. Was it his right arm... or his left? [SIGHS] It was his right. All right. What's that? Take those off. No. What? Yeah. That's it. That's it. I've been wondering about you. Yeah? Don't. I want to know. Know what? How you did that to me. Somebody taught you. Who was that? Get the fuck out of here. You can tell me. An older woman. Hmm. An older woman, huh? The chicken lady. The chicken lady? Oh, you know her? When I was 15, I was delivering chickens for a butcher to housewives for a buck a chicken. The first time I show up there, it was fucking hot, and she... I came to the door and she offered me a glass of water, so we're in the kitchen talking about the weather or some shit, and she just reaches out and she grabs a hold of my joint. She asks me, "Does that feel good?" I said, "Yeah," and she asks me, "You ever been with a woman?" And I said, "Yeah. Uh, no." So she takes me into the bedroom. She takes her clothes off and she's a real woman. I mean, she's got pubic hair from here to here. It's black and curly like the Spanish girls, and I want to get the fuck out of there, so she grabs me and says, "Have you ever kissed a girl down there?" I said, "No." So... she wets her fingers. She touches herself real soft. She touches herself and tells me to lick there. Tells me to put my tongue there and take my time, work in a slow circle. And after a while, she came. She asked me to give her... Get on top of her and look her in the eyes. Why did you go back? My kids. I missed my kids. I didn't know you had kids. How would you? My oldest boy wants to be a teacher. I don't know what the fuck happened to him. It's like Martians landed and took over his brain. What does he want to teach? Schmoogs. Can you fucking believe it? Hey, I'm missing one of my, um... I'm missing one of the charms on my... on my bracelet. Maybe on West Broadway. [SIGHS] Hey, um... you know, there's something I really... I do have to tell you. Oh, yeah? You've seen me before. I've seen you at the Red Turtle. This whole time I'm thinking to myself, I've seen this girl before, I know her from somewhere, and now you're telling me I met you at the Red Turtle. I don't think so, babe. It was dark, and I had on my glasses... and there was a man and a girl and she was giving him a blow job. A blow job? And I watched. Oh, you did, did you? You like that sort of thing? You like watching? You don't remember a girl with long, blue fingernails with diamonds in them? What did you say? "Blue fingernails"? She have brown hair? Yes. Yeah, what about her? I think that's Angela Sands. I think that's the girl that was murdered. But I wasn't with her. I think you saw something. I think you should come down to the station and look at some pictures, as soon as possible. Swear you weren't there. Swear to God. I never seen you or her before in my entire fucking life. I got to get out of here. Hey, I had a nice time. Thanks. [CHIMES TINKLING] [TRAIN CLANKING ON TRACKS] [CHILDREN PLAYING IN DISTANCE] Oh... Oh, God, I could have lost you. And then you let the detective fuck you. I didn't let him. I wanted to. You guys ordered? Double latte, no foam. Yeah. It's sore, huh? So the detective guy's sexy? You like him? You gonna see him again? Would you trust a guy who gets blow jobs in bars? Yes. I think he's a liar. You think he's a liar or he is a liar? Because, of course, we never lie, so... I saw him in a bar with a girl. Wait. A bar? Yes. I thought you just met him. I thought that he rescued you. Look, if you don't want him, I'll take him. Go back home and-- Forget it, Pauline. Forget I mentioned it. I won't forget it. No, arrange an introduction with your lying detective. Ugh. Who's that? John Graham. [LAUGHS] I thought you said he looked like a movie star. He played a doctor on a soap. Now he's studying to be one. Hi. You look terrible. Thank you. Excuse me, sir. No dogs in here. I know that. Will you be long? I just ordered a coffee. You're very tan. Hi. John Graham. Pauline. How are you? Eh... Uh... take your time. I'll wait. Don't look out there, because he's watching you. Oh, he's so intense. [SIGHS] You know, I can remember every guy I ever fucked by how he liked to do it, not how I wanted to do it. Sometimes I think it's just me. I mean, are there women able to say, "Suck my dick, pinch my nipples, bend over the sofa"? Probably not "suck my dick". [LAUGHING] Here's what I think. I think you can come over to my place and sleep there for a few nights. Maybe even a week. It would make me really happy... and the mugger has your wallet, so he's gonna know where you live. You know... you really have to see this detective again. I ordered a coffee. Um, Miss, we ordered a latte. No foam. No foam. Very, very dry. Thank you. Oh, he's still there. Whose car did you get into yesterday? It looked like it'd just come from... Beirut. I don't know how people can drive around in filthy cars. Maybe it was one of my students. Are you dating a student? Pardon? Well, you went to the Red Turtle Bar with a black student. Are you dating him? No. I saw you last Saturday. What were you doing? Is that the point here? I don't think so. The point is that he could get the wrong idea. You don't know how guys think. Are you all right, John? Not really. I've, uh... been having these panic attacks lately. At least, I think they're panic attacks. I don't know. They're pretty bad. What happens? Doesn't that ever happen to you where you get these funny images from the past, like you saw something, or you knew something? Weird memories from childhood. I just wish I didn't keep having these funny attacks. My brain... Well, my brain practically explodes. I think I'm gonna go on anti-depressants. I... I, uh... I need to ask you a favor. Do you think you could... take care of Patrick for a while? He's barking all the time, probably because my hours are so long and he's alone. The landlord says-- I can't take care of a dog. Especially not my dog, right? You'd rather cut his head off. No. Not especially your dog. Why don't you put up a notice or something? Put up a notice? Where am I? I'm in the hospital 18 hours out of 24. You don't get it, do you? I... Well, okay. Say goodbye. John, are you gonna put him down? Maybe. I don't know, maybe I will. I could do it myself. I mean, I could just shave his little arm-- Look, I don't think it's a good idea that we see each other anymore. Fuck! Fuck. Well... [WHISPERING] Fuck. Well, this is out of the blue. I'm gonna, uh... I'm gonna have to think about this. FRANNIE: Midway along the journey of our life, I woke to find myself in a dark wood, for I had wandered off from the straight path. [BELL RINGS] Thanks. Thank you.

No. You an Amazon, Miss Avery. That's like an insult. So we're here? Yeah. Hey, Papi. Hey, baby. [DOORBELL BUZZES] Um, let me help you upstairs. No, no, I got it. Thank you.

You know what I'm thinking? What to wear. No, I'm imagining that when he sees me he's gonna realize that he's in love with me and, you know, one thing will lead to another and after a love child or two... we'll get married. Have I ever told you how... our father proposed to my mother? No. Tell me. Well, when he was very young. he was... very handsome and an excellent skater, and she was the new girl in town, barely able to skate. She was very, very innocent. Very beautiful...

[♫♫♫] This is my song. ♫ Each day through my window I watch her as she passes by ♫ And finally, his fiancée got very jealous and... I would too. and threw that engagement ring right back at him. Whoa. And that very same day, he took my mother by the hand, he danced her out to the middle of the forest-fringed lake, he got down on one knee and offered her the very same engagement ring. Oh, that's nice. Mm-hmm... and at that precise moment, which is the thing that my mother always added, it started to snow. That's very romantic. I don't quite believe it. Well, that's my mother's story. That's the way she always told it, you know? It killed her. When he left, she just went crazy with grief. You know, she didn't understand it. She just... couldn't believe it. How many times has Dad been married? Four. Four? He never married my mother. Yeah, he was already plotting the fifth. I want to get married once, just for my mom.

[CELL PHONE RINGING] You got the close-up on the ring? Got it. Okay. Now, we'll start taking out... Detective Malloy. Hi. Frannie, hey. Hold on a second. I'm stepping out. All right. No problem. Hey, where you been? I've been calling you all week. You're supposed to come down and look at some photos, remember? I've been staying with Pauline. Oh, yeah? Where she's staying? She has a place above the Baby Doll Lounge. So, uh... I must have called you like 10 times. Do you think you can make it down here to the precinct tomorrow? It's kind of important. Why? Well, another girl's been murdered. A med student. Oh. Oh, no. What happened? She was cut up. Can't find her head. The fucking press is all over us. It's a Magilla. We're all doing overtime here. Even the house mouses are on the street. Do you think it's the same guy who killed Angela Sands? If you're asking me, yeah. Oh, yeah. Hey, I'm getting out of here. WOMAN: I came down to look for her. What time? Oh, I don't know. Hold on a second. I'm not gonna sleep tonight. Do something for me, will you? Are you standing? Why? Are you alone? Where's your sister? Sit down. Are you sitting? Mm-hmm. Put your hand between your legs... inside your panties. That pussy that I like. [SIGHS] And you slip your middle finger in. It's deep. You run your finger up she's right there. It comes down to meet you. It jumps in your hand. When you touch a woman and she's right there like that, you know she knows about sex, like you. I gotta go. [HANGS UP PHONE] [CAR PASSING] FRANNIE: It's off in the distance. It came into the room. It's here in the circle. Hold on one second. Can I help you? I'm here to see Detective Malloy. Malloy! Yeah. Your visitor's out here, man. It's my sister. How you doing? I want you to take a hike. Did you sleep all right? I missed you. Come on. Over here. Maybe... Look at this. We got leaks in the ceiling. They shoot down on us with .22 caliber rifles from the rooftops. Detective Rodriguez. You remember Miss... Avery. Yeah, I know your name. Hey, how you doing? Fine, thank you. Hey, you got anything on that ViCAP? Nothing. MAN: Detective Malloy. Stand by, please. Malloy! Malloy! Yeah. I'm glad I got a chance to talk to you. I want to apologize. The other night, I was drunk. I was out of line. I hope you didn't get the wrong idea. No. I didn't get the wrong idea. We're square, then? Detective Malloy wants me to look at some pictures. He said you'd have them ready. Pictures? Mm-hmm. I was mugged the other night on West Broadway. Oh, yeah, pictures. No problem. Who's that? Really? I thought the guy was wearing a mask, you couldn't see his face. No, I couldn't. Then why does Malloy want you to look at pictures? Perhaps I'll recognize the face of somebody who was at the Red Turtle Bar. No, that don't mean shit. MAN: Hey, Ritchie, what's up? What's up, Halloran? How's the diet? Hey, pato, kiss my ass. I got those phone numbers for you. It took me all fucking day. You owe me big time. Just look through there. If he's in there, he'll jump out at you. You got a good memory? If you see this guy, you're gonna be able to pick him out? I don't think that memory is very reliable. Well, it better be. You're a school teacher, right? People fucking count on your memory. Detective Rodriguez bothering you? Telling you about the fish in the Hudson? Actually, I was telling her about the time the cat ate the DOA's balls on 123rd Street. That's a good one. Malloy. Malloy. What am I, your maid or something? Your food is ready. Your curry tofu. [♫♫♫] ♫ Come here, my love ♫ ♫ There'll be no harm ♫ ♫ Long as I've you ♫ ♫ Here in my arms ♫ [DRAWER SLAMS] I gotta get something to eat. You hungry? You like calamari? There's this great place over on Arthur Avenue. Hey, Ritchie, what I want to know is when did you start liking white women, man? About the same time as you. See you later. Let's get the fuck out of here. This place is too fucking busy. Come on. Let's go somewhere quiet. [INDISTINCT POLICE RADIO TRANSMISSIONS] How did you get to be a homicide detective so young? Me? Yeah. [CLEARS THROAT] In a word? Yeah. Compassion. I took the desk no one else wanted. What desk was that? The desk next to the holding cell. You know, so I talked to the perps. Gave them cigarettes, gum, so they start to trust you. You know, start telling you things you want to know. After a while, you pull down a big confession. You know, I got some bumps up. Hey, how long do you think, uh... how long do you think... you suppose a woman needs to know a guy before she'll get engaged to him? Shortest amount of time. Come on, Malloy. How long? Oh, I don't know. I guess it depends. Um... it took my mother about a half-hour. You're kidding me. No. What did your father do? Romance her to fall in love? Put a gun to her head? What did... How'd that happen? Yeah... Yeah. Oh, what can ail thee Knight-at-arms Alone and palely loitering? The sedge has withered From the lake And no birds sing What's sedge? Ferns. This looks like a place where they dump bodies. What's in these bags? [GUNSHOT] [GASPS] Garbage. Go on, try it. No. I'm frightened of guns. Oh, yeah? Then why don't you learn to use one? Go on. Go on. How do you hold this thing? With one hand or two? Hold it any way you want. Just don't hold it this way. Again. You have to hold it with two hands. Yeah. Try aiming this time. Try. Go on. Try. Cheap piece of shit. Let's see how good kissers we are. We already kissed. No, not really. Come on, Miss Isthmus. [KNOCKS ON HOOD] Did you used to do this when you were a kid? I went to boarding school. You're here for the sex, right? You don't go nowhere with me. I didn't fuck you. [♫♫♫] [MUTTERS] [CLEARS THROAT] [HONKS HORN] [CHUCKLES] Would you get engaged to me? Is this about the murder? No. Yeah, I can't get the sick fuck out of my head. While we were kissing? All the fucking time. So... do you want to stop by my place? Yeah... I got to tell you. I'm going away for a while. Probably not going to be able to talk to you for a little bit. Where are you going? Florida. It's all paid for so I could have some time with my kids. Is your wife going? My ex-wife? Yeah. No, your wife. Get the fuck out of here. I sleep on the fucking couch. All right? It's complicated. When I moved out, I didn't have enough money to get my own apartment, so I went to live with my mother. She's worse than my wife. Three years ago I moved back. We don't sleep together, all right? I moved back for my kids, okay? She can't control my kids. Do you ever tell the truth? Where you going? I'll give you a ride home. Hey. [SIGHS] [FLOORBOARD CREAKS] Something wrong? How did you get in? I hope you don't mind. I took a shower. You know, you might want to check your messages. That student of yours has been taken in for questioning. The police found his term paper illustrated in blood. That's a little weird, isn't it? You want some tea? I have to go out. [EXHALES SLOWLY] Actually, the real reason that I'm here is because... I thought I should tell you that I'm gonna call Pauline and ask her out. Really? Did I ever tell you that my mother used to dress me in girls' blouses? Yes, I think you did. So, do you think it's a good idea? What? About Pauline. I think it's a good idea, but, you know, then again, I hardly know her at all. Well, I don't think Pauline will sleep with you, if that's what you're thinking. Oh, you're right. You're right. What am I thinking? She's worse than you are. Have sex with me? I must be out of my fucking mind. Will you have sex with me? Shit! I'm out of my fucking mind! Will you have sex with me? Now Thinking back On the course Of my passion I was like one blind Unafraid of the dark [♫♫♫] Have you seen Pauline? WOMAN: No. She hasn't come in tonight? No, she hasn't, but, um... just let me check, okay? Have you seen Pauline? No. No. Myself, I hate to drink alone. [HANDLE TURNS] [WATER RUNNING] Pauline? Pauline? Are you alone? Oh... [SOBS] [CRIES OUT] MALLOY: Frannie? Frannie. Frannie, it's Malloy. Hon, I got to take that bag away from you. I got to take the bag. Come on. I know. I know. I got to take it. [WOMAN SOBBING] Hey, Jackie. Yeah? Can you get her to 622 on 6th Street, please? No problem. Oh, my God. [CLEARS THROAT] I was at the morgue. I'm sorry they made you wait. I told them to let you go home. I need to ask you some questions about Pauline, Frannie. [SIGHS] Let's go. When I was 13, um... my father left me in Geneva. He was called away to Washington for five days. He said later that it never occurred to him that I wouldn't be all right. Pauline said that I... failed to take advantage of the situation, that I should have ordered... hundreds of boxes of chocolate, that I should have made a snowman. Was Pauline engaged? No. Do you recognize this? We found it on her left third finger. No. Is that it? Is that his signature? Yeah, it's his signature. I want to know what happened. I want to know if it was quick. Why do you think knowing's going to make a difference, Frannie? I thought that all my life. Well, you're wrong. Knowing don't mean shit. "Doesn't" mean shit. This guy... This guy must have known her. He, uh... strangled her till she lost consciousness, probably in the bedroom, and then dragged her into the bathroom and cut her throat. Cut through the wind pipe, the jugular, the epiglottis, the hyoid, the tongue. He held her by her hair and cut all round. This guy likes blood. When he got to the vertebrae, he needed a bigger knife to cut through that, and he had one. He pulled the drain in the sinks before he left, so he left us nothing that could help us. It scares me that this guy knows about drains. I'm going to go back to the apartment. There's something I know but I don't know it yet. Sometimes it helps just to sit there, you know? How will you get in? I got a key. You have a key? Yeah. You have her key? I guess so. I have a key. Did you kill her? Sergeant Lawrence, can you give Miss Avery a drive home, please? Yeah. Go on, get the fuck out of here.

Ritchie said you were screaming half-naked out the window. You were a long time. Yeah. I was working. Getting a blow job? Isn't that your line of work? What is it? "No such thing as a bad blow job." Well, you're wrong there. Some women give terrible blow jobs. No rhythm at all. No sense of cock whatsoever. Good phrase. "No sense of cock." Yes, that must be terrible. Frannie, we got a problem here. I'm standing in your sister's apartment and I'm trying to put this case together and I can't. You want to know why? I'm worrying about you. Let's get you cleaned up, come on. Give you a bath. [SOBS] Let's go. Good cop. I'm a good detective. It's the only thing I'm good at. I'm not good at this. You want me to go, I'll go. You want me to stay, I'll stay. You got to want something. You're smarter than I am. I'm running just to keep up with you. I'm scared of what I want. Why? Is it a lot? [SIGHS] Yeah, it's a lot. That's the problem with you women. You can never be satisfied. I'm sorry. Why? You didn't do nothing. I'm sorry you feel that way. That's your problem, is you're fucking exhausting. Fuck this. You know, I was doing just fine before I met you. Just fine. What's this? You'll see. Will I like it? I don't know. I think so. You're not sure. You're not sure. You think I'm obsessed with you? Maybe. No. No. No. [MOANS] Go on. Fuck yourself. I want to watch you fuck yourself. Go on. You like to watch? Yeah, I like it in the cut. That's it. Fuck yourself. That's it. Go on. [CRYING OUT] [GROANS] Oh, you're so beautiful. If I keep looking at you, I'm gonna have to quit being a cop. Frannie... Oh, Frannie... Frannie... All right. Get me out of these things. [LAUGHS] Get me out of this. It makes me very nervous being in handcuffs. Hurry up. I'm starting to fucking feel like a chick here. [LAUGHING] Get over there. Where is it? In my jacket pocket. Hurry up. Yeah. Inside left pocket. Hurry up. Oh, yeah. The charm from my bracelet. Yeah. I keep meaning to give it to you. I forgot. Where did you get this? I found it on West Broadway. I went back there the same night to see if I missed something, and I found it. It was you. What the fuck is the matter with you? I saw you. I saw your tattoo. I saw... I never thought that you killed her. I just never thought that. Frannie, get me out of these fucking things now! That's enough of this shit, Frannie. Give me... Give me the key. Get me out of here! I'm not kidding, Frannie. Get me out of this fucking thing. Unlock these fucking things now! Frannie! [SCREAMS] Damn it! Fuck! [BRAKES SCREECH] Get your fucking ass off the goddamn street, bitch! Oh! Whoa, baby. Are you okay? You all right? She's fine. Thanks, Dad. Take it easy. I didn't know. Just take it... Take it easy. I can't-- I can't go with you, because he'll know. What? He killed Pauline. Who? Malloy. I saw him with Angela Sands. I saw his tattoo. I saw the three of spades. Jesus. We'd better talk about this. We'll go someplace. You can tell me about it. I can't go to the police. You tell me what happened. MALLOY: Frannie! Did he hurt you? No. [ENGINE TURNS OVER] Frannie! Fuck! No! Where are we going? To the lighthouse. You ever been there? To the Lighthouse. I teach that book. Yeah? I fish there. Look at the G.W. That's something. It's my little fishing lodge. Want to see inside?
