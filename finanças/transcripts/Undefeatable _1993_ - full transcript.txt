(slow, dramatic music) - I don't know what happened. Paul used to be so sweet. But he's changed. He's violent. Sometimes he hurts me. Paul used to make a good living as a mechanic. Now he just fights. (tense music) (grunting) - Boxing, you mean professionally? - No. This is different. It's brutal. (grunting) He fights for money in a ring anywhere. They call 'em death matches. (grunting) - Anna. If you're in danger, you need to protect yourself. Even if that means leaving Paul. - I don't know, I mean... He wasn't like this. Maybe you could talk to him. - I'd be happy to, if he was willing. But it sounds to me like that's something he's gonna have to come to on his own. In the meantime, you have to do what's good for you. If you would... Do you have anywhere else to stay? (solemn music) - Can I help you? - Sure, your money. - Hey, I just want to pay for this. - It's on the house, kid! - Ow. - Hey buddy, you okay? - Mm-hmm. - You sure? - Mm-hmm. - Money? - So, do I get mine on the house too? - No way, asshole. You gotta pay. - Now that's not fair. You gave the kid his for free. Or maybe you're just too much of a chicken shit to pick on someone your own size. - He's right, you shouldn't play favorites. Okay, tough guy, come and get some for free. - Come on, tough guy! (grunting) - Suck my dick! - [Nick] Suck this, jerk-off. - Hey, come on, Nick, we gotta go. What's this? - Just a couple of punks giving me a warmup. - We'll sue you for police brutality, pig. - Yeah, yeah, shut up. - [Man] You sure you're up for this? How's your rib? - What are you, my mother? Alan, how much can we make on this fight? - You couldn't punch her luck. Let's give this one. - No way. Karen's tuition is due this month. - [Man] Well, if you need money that bad, (mumbling). - [Man] Yeah, where is he? - He's over there. - If Kristi says she's okay, then I believe her. Right? - You're such a friend. - Hey baby. You like it rough? Why don't we just skip this fight and go on back to my place? - ' Cause you're gonna be too busy looking for your teeth. - Ah, so it's going to be like that, huh? - Yeah. It's gonna be like that. - All right, same game, same rules. Here's the money, winner takes all of it. Ready? (feet stomping) (hands clapping) (grunting) (shouting) - Don't touch, don't touch, you lose! - Come on! (shouting) - El Diablo, looks like you lose. - Okay, pay up. - Good fight. $600. (tires squealing) - Police! - Freeze! (bells ringing) - Do you know where they were going? - Yeah, man, I think she's in biology class. - Well, I think the science programs are down there, let's go. - Okay. - There she is. Hey Karen. - Karen. - Hi Karen. - Hi guys. What are you all doing here? Don't tell me Kristi got you all to apply. I thought she was joking. - No, we applied, but they wouldn't let us in, they said our IQs are too high. - Anyway. - Anyway, we didn't come to talk. - Yeah, Kristi needs your help. - Oh? Molly, I'll talk to you later. - [Molly] Bye. - What's wrong, is she hurt? Did she have an accident? - Nah, nah. It's nothing like that. She got arrested, that's all. - Arrested, why? - Just a misunderstanding. - Yeah, a misunderstanding. - Some guy was having a fight. - Yeah, and the cops arrested Kristi by mistake. - But why Kristi, was she fighting? - No, she was just in the wrong place. - Yeah, that's all. They swept through the whole neighborhood and just picked up everyone under 30. - Age discrimination. - Anyway, once the cops meet you and see how you're her beautiful sister and a terrific student and all, they'll chill out and let her go. - Okay, well, what do we have to do? - Just come with us, we've got everything under control. - [Man] Yeah, let's go. You drive. - Karen. - Oh hi, Dr. Simmons. - Aren't you coming to class? - Oh, I forgot to tell you, I have to go meet my sister for dinner tonight, right? - [Man] Yeah, right. - Okay, but will I see you in class next time? - Oh yes, definitely. - So what are you doing, some research for your abnormal psychology project? - These are just some friends of my sister's. - All right. I'll see you next time. - Bye. - Karen, I'm surprised at you, lying. Is that what they teach you in college? (tense music) (door creaking) - Tea? What's wrong, you don't like tea? - Do you know how long I've been waiting here? - So? Don't you like it here? - What do you want from me? I told you I didn't do anything. - I want the names of the other fighters, and I want to know who runs the fights. - Was there a fight? I didn't see one. - No? Where'd this come from? Fine, stay here all night. If you want to, you can stay here all week. Kristi, why are you doing this to yourself? Why don't you get a job somewhere? Get away from these gangs. - I have a job, but I won't for long, if you don't let me out of here. - You have a job? - Yeah, I have a job - Where? - Blue Moon Cafe, on Third and Main. - Kristi, you make this working in a diner? Come on. - What are you guys picking on me for? So I make a little bit of money on the side. Big deal. I have bills to pay, I have a sister in college. Cops. Why are you all doing your job, arresting murderers and rapists, instead of arresting innocent people? - There's this preppy-looking kid outside asking for her. Claims to be her sister. - Damn, Karen's here? - Anything serious? - No. A few arrests for fighting and disturbing the peace. No time served, though. - Kristi, I tell you what. I'm gonna cut you a break. You can take off. - What about my money? - Let me give you some advice. Stay off the streets. You'll live longer. - Thanks for the tea, Sergeant. - No problem. - You're making a big mistake, Nick. - I don't think so, Mike. You're wrong about this one. She's okay. - Ow! You're gonna make a great doctor. - You oughta know, you came here with enough cuts and bruises. Kristi, why were you fighting? I thought you weren't in the Red Dragons anymore. - I thought we weren't gonna discuss this. - I can't help it, I had to get you out of jail today. And the police told me you were in a gang fight, gambling. I don't know what I'd do if anything ever happened to you, - Nothing's gonna happen. I have the guys set up a few fights and we place bets. It's not dangerous, really. Just think of it like pro sports, only smaller. Karen, I can't afford to pay your tuition just by waitressing. So until I put you through school- - I can help. I can get a job, I can take time off school. - Nope. Nope. You're gonna finish school. - I don't see why not. - Do you remember how Mom died? Poor. She had no job, no husband, no health insurance. When she got sick, we couldn't even get a good doctor. I promised her then that I'd take care of you and make sure that you get a good education. - [Karen] I miss her. - Yeah, me too. But you're not off the hook. You're my investment. When you become a doctor, you gonna put me through college. - Those poor teachers. - So you gonna let me worry about the bills? - Only if you promise to take care of yourself, okay? - Okay, I promise. - Hey, Anna. - Hi Paul. How was the fight? - I made 'em squirm. (woman gasps) And I'm undefeated. - Oh sweetheart, why don't you just get cleaned up while I finished cooking dinner? - Come on, baby. - Paul, dinner's almost ready. - Come on, Mommy. I want to play. - Paul, I'm not in the mood. (screams) - Dammit, bitch! You ruined my mood! - You're hurting me! (crying) No, no, no. No. No. Stop! (crying) No! (shouting) No! Stop! (crying) (suspenseful music) (meat sizzling) - Anna, come on, eat. - I'm not hungry. - Yeah, that's what I like, a good deal. Get 'em in two weeks. Hey, (mumbling). All right, gotta go. Yeah, bye. That last fight was great. The boys from Philly were real impressed. - Thanks, Lou. You got my money? - Yeah, sure. Here you go. 20 thou. - Thanks, Lou. See you around. - Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. Got a deal I want to talk over with you. Those boys from Philly want you to fight their man next month. Talking serious cash, buddy boy. - How much? - You're end, 100,000. - Set it up. - Good. By the way. How's Anna? You taking care of her? - Yeah, real good. - Enjoy it while you can, Sting Ray. Monday we're back in the gym. - Later, Lou. (tense music) Anna, baby, I'm home. Anna? I have a surprise for you. Anna? Where are you? I said I'm home. If you're hiding, I'll break your fucking neck. Anna, did you hear me? - [Anna] Paul, by the time you read this, I'll be long gone. I left you your favorite dinner. My heart is breaking as I write these words to you. What happened, Paul? I mean, we had the perfect home. I just can't take it anymore. Your love has turned to abuse, your touch has turned to pain. I am not your mother. Every time you call me Mommy, you choke the life out of me. I've finally come to understand what my psychiatrist has said all along. I deserve better, and I'm leaving you. Don't worry, I'm returning the most precious gift you gave me, your mother's pendant. Don't try to find me. I'll be far away. I am not coming back. Anna. - No! (shouting) Anna! (tinkling music) - [Man] Tired of this shit, woman. I ain't taking care of him. - [Woman] It's just for tonight. - [Man] I don't care if it's for one minute. I'm with you, not your kid. - [Woman] What do you want me to do? - [Man] That ain't my problemm. You can get rid of him for all I care. - [Woman] He's my kid! - [Man] If I have to take second place to him, I'm gone. - [Woman] No, please! - Mommy, don't go! - Don't leave me, Mommy. (ominous music) I promise to be good. Mommy, take me with you. (water running) (dramatic music) - Anna. I'll find you. I will find you. (squeals) - What the hell? - I'll take care of this. Look, buddy, I don't know who you are, but I'm gonna kick your ass! - What are you doing with my wife? - Wife! - I'm not your wife, mister! - [Paul] Shut up, Anna! - That's it, man. (grunting) (suspenseful music) - Oh my god, somebody help! Oh my god, get up! Do it, do it! (shouting and grunting) - There you go. - Hey, thanks. - Would you like some more coffee? - [Woman] Yes, please. - So Tiffany, how you doing in school? - Fine, I got an A in math. - You did? Well that's great. You know, you have to keep up... What are you doing here? - Hey, this looks like a nice place, and I got hungry. - [Kristi] Right. - Well, how about some coffee, black, and a smile? I've been asking around. The story on your sister checks out. - No shit. - I respect what you're doing. I just think you could do a lot better than fighting for that punk. - So what are you, my job counselor now? Why can't you just leave me alone? - I'm only trying to help. - [Kristi] Well, I don't need your help. - Kristi, everyone needs. (pager beeping) Damn. Hey, how much for the coffee? - [Tiffany] $1.50. - Thanks. - Will there be anything else? - [Woman] No thanks. - Yo, Kristi. Our main girl. What's up? Whoa, where'd you get the roll? - Tips. - Not bad, you think you could lend- - No. So what's up, guys? - If you got the tab, we got (mumbling). Get it? Yeah? - Duh, no, I don't get it. - Anyway. We got a fight, if you want 'em. - Yeah. The man says the odds are three to one against. You interested? - You bet. Set it up. I have to get back to work, so see you guys later. - What about the loan? (muttering) (suspenseful music) - Stop! Let me go! Please! (shouting) Can't you see I'm not your wife? Please let me go! I promise I won't say anything! (shouting) Please let me go. I promise I won't say anything, just let me go. - Did you think I wouldn't find you? You shouldn't have run off with that punk, Anna. (crying) - Oh, god, no! (shouting) (people chattering) - Not now, stay back, please. - Chuck, Mike, what do we have here, guys? - This guy was beaten to death. He's got a broken nose. His eyes were torn out. You ready for the kicker? This was Sung Kim. - World karate champ? (whistles) Anything else? - Yeah, he has a strange bruise on his neck. - Any witnesses? - None. But the parking attendant said that Sung was with a girl when he came in here. No sign of her or the car. - Put out an APB on the vehicle, along with the description on the girl. - Sergeant, the captain's on the radio for you. - Great. What next? - Looks like she was tortured, and raped. That bastard poked her eyes out. - Mike, you personally make sure the photographers get a shot of this. I want the reporters kept out of here and I want that lab report on my desk as soon as possible. - You got it. (tense music) - Okay, Rocko. Where's this big bear? - You better not be backing out on us. - Hey, you said three to one odds! - He'll be here. What are you betting? - A thousand. - Where'd you get that kind of cash? - Tips. Do you have it covered? - No problem. Got that covered? - [Crowd] Bear! Bear! Bear! Bear! Bear! Bear! Bear! Bear! Bear! Bear! Bear! Bear! Bear! Bear! Bear! Bear! Bear! Bear! Bear! Bear! Bear! Bear! Bear! Bear! Bear! Bear! Bear! Bear! Bear! Bear! Bear! Bear! Bear! Bear! Bear! Bear! Bear! Bear! Bear! Bear! Bear! Bear! Bear! Bear! - He's big. - The bigger they are, the harder they fall. - All right, you know the rules. No guns, knives, bricks, or anything else. Remember, your hand touches the ground, you're done. - It's game time, rookie. (mumbling) - Poor little baby bear, had to steal his mama's Tupperware. Now it's time to play. - Ready? Fight! - Right. Jocks. - Bear! Bear! Bear! Bear! Bear! Bear! (shouting and grunting) - Awesome, yeah! - Come on, kick her butt, Bear! Get her, come on, you can get her! (shouting) (laughs) - You're done, Bear. - Son of a bitch! - Oh, Bear! (muttering) - Shit! - All right, yeah! - That bitch, she cheated me! - Oh, my honey bear. - Anna. (solemn music) - Get me a Coke. - Okay, give me a minute, I gotta go to the can. - Damn. Damn. - Hello, Anna. Time to go, Anna. - What? - Let me go! Bear, kill this bastard! - Son of a bitch! (suspenseful music) (grunting) - Get him, Bear, get him! (grunting and shouting) - No! (woman screaming) (grunting and shouting) - DeMarco. What are you doing here? I thought you'd be busy with this serial killer case. - No lead yet, Captain. We're hoping the lab turns up something, though. - Yeah, and I've been going through the files to see if anybody fits this guy's MO. - Good, drop all other cases till you clear this thing up. Mayor's breaking my stones over this one. You know what that means. - Yeah. Perform or else. - Do whatever you have to to bring this guy in, and keep me posted, so I can give the mayor something to feed the press. They're having a field day with this one. If something doesn't give, heads are gonna roll. - [Both] Yes, sir. (tense music) - Oh, excuse me, I didn't see ya. - That's okay. It can happen to anyone. - Sorry for the accident. - You could stop by my place for a drink and make it up to me. - Can't get this kind of stuff here. A samurai sword. - But I really wanna get Kristi the sword. - We need to go to a martial arts- - No thanks. - What are you gonna get Kristi for her birthday? - I don't know, I haven't figured itout yet. - Better hurry up, her birthday's tomorrow. - Yeah, I will. - Hello, Anna. Anna, you're coming with me. - Hey! (grunting) - You're crazy, my name's not Anna. (grunting and shouting) (grunting) - [Nick] Kristi. (solemn music) - Listen, I really appreciate what you did for me the other day, but I don't think you should be-- - Kristi, I've got bad news. - What? - Listen. Just let me say this. We think your sister was murdered. I need you to identify the body. - You gotta be wrong. - Kristi, I hope so. Let's go down to the station, check it out. - I want to warn you. This isn't going to be easy. - Go ahead (crying) - Karen! Oh my god! It's not fair, it's not fair! (mumbling) Who did this! (crying) (shouting indistinctly) (crying) No, no, it's not fair! (crying) (grunting) (cheering) (cheering) - You got a lot of nerve coming here dressed like that. - Are you looking for somethin'? - I'm lookin' for you, Lee. - Kristi Jones, the Red Dragons. (spits) What's up? I heard you went straight. - You still like hurting women, Lee? Heard you been busy lately. - Who sent you here? Gloria? Hey. She asked for it. She may not be saying it now, but I'm telling you, she was begging for it then, so naturally, I obliged the lady. - I'm talkin' about my sister. Your ass is mine. - Big mistake, Red. (tense music) (grunting and shouting) Lee, come on, get her! (grunting and shouting) Yeah! - You're crazy, you ain't no cop! - You're lucky I didn't kill you now, you piece of shit. - Hold it right there. Kristi, what the hell are you doing? I don't want to hear it. Save it to the station. Kristi, I was worried about you. You stormed out of the morgue on me. Where have you been? - I just needed some time to be alone. - Just get in the car. - Want to tell me why you were over on the north side, fighting Eagles? - I had to do something, Nick. Karen was killed by Lee. - How do you know that? - They're called the Eagles because the Lee is an expert in eagle claw kung fu. - So? - Karen was killed by someone using eagle claw. He and his boys have dumped lots of girls in that park. - Listen, I'm gonna share some classified information with you. I've studied the martial arts, and whoever was doing this is definitely not using eagle technique. The marks are different. I don't know what this is, but I have an idea who might. - Wait a minute. Maybe Lee knows another style of kung fu. We've got skin types from under the fingernails of most of the victims. Lee's skin doesn't match. - So it isn't Lee? - No, Kristi. Look, Lee's small-time, shoplifting, an occasional break-in. He's nothing like the guy we're looking for. Our investigation will go a whole lot more smoothly if you just stay out of it. I know you're upset, and you can get hurt. You're not a police woman. - And your sister isn't dead. (sighs) - Look. I'm sorry about Karen. I really am. But Kristi, you can't do this. Listen, if you get any more ideas, please, just call me first. In the meantime, I'll keep you up to date on our progress. Now go home or I'm gonna put you in jail. Okay? - Nick, what are you doing? - [Nick] Hey, I'm just working with the community to solve this case. - I can't believe you just let her walk out of here, again. You're getting involved with her, aren't you? - Come on, Mike, she's a good kid. She just wants to help. Besides, this way I can keep an eye on her. - Yeah, and I hope you know what you're doing. - I can't believe the cops. They haven't made one single arrest. And the only reason they brought Lee in was because of me. - Why'd you go after him anyway? - When they brought Karen in, she had these claw marks on her neck. Lee's the only one I know that could strike like that. - About three months ago, some guy at the club was hassling this pretty blond. And I thought to straighten him out. - Damn! - Caught me sideways, otherwise I'd be dead. - Who was it? - Some guy named Ryko from the Maniacs. - The Maniacs? They're a bunch of punks. - There were a bunch of punks. - Now they're a bunch of crack heads, and they do anything they want. - Set up a fight. I want to check this Ryko out. - The minute I show up over there, all hell's gonna break loose. - Then you set it up. And you better call in the boys, because we might need help. Do me a favor. Call Nick. (tense music) - That's Ryko. - Where's Jimmy? - In court. - I don't like this. - Let's do it. - Same rules, same game, winner takes all. - Kristi, you're dead meat. You got the one on finger Lee. - Just want to ask you a few questions about my sister's death. - This is fucking bullshit. - We don't do business that way. Take your money. Don't call me, don't contact me. I don't want to see you. - Lee's my friend. About your sister's death? I don't give a shit. I just want to kick your ass. - Wrong answer, asshole. - Hey, you watch your mouth! - Hey, hey! I'll take care of it. (shouting and grunting) - You okay? (shouting and grunting) - Let's go! - Let's go! (shouting) (gunshots banging) - All right, kids, recess is over. Up against the wall, you're all under arrest. Come on, move! You call this cooperation? Look at this. You're gonna start another gang war. Well, I tried to wait for you, but they jumped us. You've got a lot to learn about police work. Spread 'em. (solemn music) - I just wanted you to know how sorry I am. - Thanks. Karen really respected you a lot. - I enjoyed teaching her. She was a terrific student. - This is Dr. Simmons. She was one of Karen's teachers at the university. - Please call me Jennifer. - Sergeant Nick DeMarco, metro homicide. What do you teach? - Abnormal psychology. Have you found anything yet? - We've arrested some suspects. The lab results came back negative. Maybe I could get your input sometime, it might help. - Absolutely. And if you need anything, call me. You can reach me at my office. - Great, thanks. Kristi, if you're free, I got something at the station I think you'd like to see. - What is it? - I brought in a specialist in martial arts. He's gonna help identify that the marks. - In martial arts, there are many strikes modeled after animal claw techniques, such as the tiger claw, please, which is for striking, tearing, and the eagle claw, grabbing, praying mantis for striking, and grappling, hooking. - Which technique do you think our man is using? - None. - With all due respect, sir, it looks like our list of suspects just got pretty long. - Quite the contrary. This bro, he's (mumbling) of the Chinese dragon claw. And it was developed in Okinawa just before the war. Thank you. And I know of only three Americans who use it. - Can you give us their names? - Sure. (tense music) (knocking on door) (dog barking) - Tough guy. - Yeah, very funny. - What are you doing here? - We're looking for Mr. Stewart. - Who the hell are you? I'm gonna call the police. - Relax. I am the police. - Charlotte Crips, neighborhood watch president. Is Mr. Stewart in trouble? - Have you seen him? - No. Actually, he's been away for about a month. Honeymoon. I've been watching the house and walking his dog. Is anything wrong? - No. We have some questions for him, but it can wait. Thanks. (knocking on door) - Yes? - I'm looking for Joe Patrone. - Michelle, let me talk. What are you, a salesman? - Police. Have you seen him? - I'm Joe Patrone. What do you want? (mumbling) - Sure. - Okay. (tense music) - Shit, that cop's here. You guys take care of him, and I'm outta here. - No problem. - Here for lessons? - I'm here to see your boss. - He ain't here. - Why don't I just go see for myself? - No, no, I think you do need a free lesson. Guys, teach this guy a lesson. (shouting and grunting) - What's your hurry? - Honey, I don't know what you want, but I gotta get outta here. - Not so fast, honey. - Look, I don't want to hurt a girl. Get out of my way. (grunting and shouting) (groaning and coughing) - You have the right to remain silent. So do me a favor and shut up. - Ow! What the hell are you doing? - Just shut up. Impressive. - Piece of cake. So who's Ron. - He is! - I'm gonna get you guys (tense music) - I got good news and I got bad news. - Give me the damn bad news first. - Vista's not our man. The lab results don't match. - I know, lab guys were just here. - So much for Woo's list, huh? - Yeah. I've called in a psychiatrist from the university. I hope she can shed some light on this thing. - Good idea. - So what's the good news? - I got tickets for tomorrow night's game. Mid-court, fifth row. - All right. (knocking on door) - Sergeant DeMarco? - Here she is now. - She's a psychiatrist? - Down, boy. Dr. Simmons, come in, please. This is my partner, Detective Mike Thompson. - Dr. Summons. - Nice to meet you. - Do you like basketball? - No. - Mike was just leaving. Have a seat, please. - Nice to meet you. - Can I get you anything? Coffee or soda? - I'm fine, thanks. - All right, I'll jump right in, then. All but two of the victims are women. Each of them had their wind pipe broken and both eyes removed. Later victims had other broken bones, arms and legs. Maybe they tried to fight back. - Maybe, or he could be getting angrier, that happens. - Each woman was found with flowers by her body, irises, and they were all wearing flowered dresses. - How does he break their windpipes? - We examined the bruises, and identified a particular martial arts style, but I need to know more. Anything you can tell me'll help. - Well, most serial killers were seriously abused or neglected as children. They kill to get back at their abusers. I mean, this guy is obviously taking revenge on some woman. His mother, a girlfriend, a wife, very likely a wife. - Why do you think so? - Well, look at these pictures. I mean, if you didn't know better, you'd think these women were related. He has a fixation with one woman, red hair, young, petite. - Great. So you're telling me any young redhead wearing a flowered dress is at risk? - Not necessarily. He may make them wear the dress as part of some ritual. - But the eyes. Why does he tear out their eyes? - I don't know. Again, it could be part of a ritual. Oh my god. - Do you have something? - I'm not sure. - Doctor, I got a damn psycho piling up dead bodies with no eyes. If you think you have something, please tell me. - It could be nothing. I have a tremendous case load of mostly battered women. I'll have my secretary check the files and I'll get back to you. - Good. I'll have Kristi take another look at this photo to see if that's Karen's dress. - Good idea. - Thanks. - Hello, Mr. Robinson. - Hi Doctor. - Hi Betty. - Hi. - Is Anna Taylor's file still on my desk? - Yes it is. - All right. I'll be with Mr. Roberts in just a moment. - Okay. (tense music) (tense music) - [Anna] I've finally come to understand what my psychiatrist has said all along. I deserve better, and I've got to leave you. - Sergeant DeMarco, please. Nick, it's Jennifer Simmons. I think I found something. I have a client whose husband is a professional fighter, a very violent, abusive man. Now, not only that, but she always wore flower print dresses, and she even mentioned that her favorite flowers were irises. Now, in our last session, I had advised her to leave him. If she did, well, this could be his sick attempt to find her to punish her for it. - Have you seen this woman recently? - No. Not since that last visit. - Do you have an address? - Yeah, I do. If you're gonna go to their house, I'd like to meet you there. - Well, this is police business, Jennifer. - Nick, I can't continue helping you unless I do. - All right, but park down the block, and stay in your car until I get there. - Deal. Thank you. (tense music) (knocking on door) - Clear. Clear, go, check downstairs, move. All clear upstairs, you okay, Mike? - All clear down here. - This is her. - Irises. - Same kind we've been finding on the victims. - I think she must've finally left her husband. - Since she's not among our victims yet, maybe she got away. - Mike, get the lab guys up here, I want a set of prints. - You got it. - Also, try to find out what kind of car this guy drives. If he is our boy and he's getting sloppy, we might just get lucky. After you. - Okay, Mr. Williams, we'll see you Friday. Buh-bye. Hi, can I help you? - Hi, is Dr. Simmons in? - No, I'm afraid she's not. She won't be coming in today. Can I take a message, mister? - No message. I'm an old friend. I want to surprise her. - Okay. - Whoa, hold up, Speedy. - Hey, what's up? - Jennifer came through with a name and an address for us. It looks like a client of hers was married to our murderer. We searched his place, took prints. They match. - Who is he? - Paul Taylor, goes by the street name Stingray. You know him? - I heard of him. He's pretty brutal. That's why they call him the Stingray. He fights for a guy by the name of Lou Demsky. Big money, I hear. - You know where to find them Dempsky? - He has a place on the south side, across from Wagner's gym. - Good, let's go. - You mind if we stop at my house first? - Not at all. - Race you back. - [Nick] No, let's take my car. (groans) - Violet, I've been trying to get ahold of you all week. What have you been doing? - I've been busy. - Doing what? Big fight Friday, I got a lot of money riding on you, Stingray. Damn! Come over and see what's keeping you so damn busy. It's probably some broad. - Where are you going? - Hey, Marta, keep an eye on the place for me, okay? - But you have an appointment with Mr. Brown, where the hell are you going? - So set it up for tomorrow! - Mr. Brown, he went out. He probably went to the warehouse. Well, could we schedule you on Friday? How about Monday? Okay. Well, thank you, goodbye. (knocking on door) Can I help you? - We're looking for Lou Demsky. - Who in the hell are you? - Sergeant DeMarco, metro homicide. Where's Demsky? - [Marta] He went out. Why don't you come back later? - Is this him? - Yeah. Cute, ain't he? - Yeah, he's a real sweetheart. The minute you hear from your boss, have him give me a call. Okay? - Anything for you. - Paul! Stingray, it's me, Lou! You think he'd hire a maid, I pay him enough damn money. Shit! What's Stingray have eyeballs in a fish tank for? What the... (tense music) Holy shit. - You looking for me, Lou? - Hey Stingray. I came to check on you, buddy. You didn't make it to the meeting with the boys from Philly. - I told you I was busy. - Yeah, I can see that. Real busy. I mean, we can work this out, you know. We're old friends. - You shouldn't have come here, Lou. Me and Anna were having a nice time till you showed up. - What are you, crazy? She's dead. I didn't mean that. I mean, who looked out for you when you came back from Japan? Me. We can work this out, you know. Nobody needs to know about it. We'll hide the body- - Hide the body?! Hide Anna?! - Hey listen, I'm just trying to help, Stingray, you know? We're old friends. - You don't care about Anna or me. You only care about the money! (shouting and grunting) - Well, it looks like the sharks are here. - Who called all these reporters in, anyway? - Hey, is that Lou Dempsky, the fight promoter? - No comment. - Come on! - Later, please. (people chattering) Damn, I can't believe we got this close only to lose this guy. Think Stingray's onto us? - No, it's more likely Demsky was onto Stingray. We've got to find his warehouse before he kills anyone else. - I'll run the title search on Dempsky and Stingray. The warehouse has gotta be in one of their names. - That's a good idea. In the meantime, I'll check back with the doc and I'll also try Kristi. Maybe she knows a street fighter he's working out with. He's gotta be training with someone. - Nick, it's Jennifer. I've got something. I got a note from my client, Stingray's wife, along with a bottle of her favorite perfume. Anyway, the note says, "thanks for everything. I finally did it, I'll be in touch." - Do you remember her saying anything about the apartment we could use? For example, particular noises or odors? Anything at all? - No, nothing like that. I mean, if I find anything, I'll let you know. - Thanks, Jennifer. I'll talk to you soon. - All right. Betty, why are you... Betty? (tense music) Betty? Betty? Oh my god. (shrieks) (grunting) (screams) - It's all your fault. - What are you talking about? - Don't lie to me! She told me all about you in her note! (mumbling) - Did she tell you how much she loved you? - No! (screams) She told me she didn't love me anymore. She didn't want to be with me anymore. - Don't be ridiculous, sweetheart. Paul. Of course I love you. Of course I love you, sweetheart. I wore your favorite perfume. (tense music) - Anna? Anna, you smell so good. I'll make you some tea, okay? I'll make you some tea. - Okay, Anna. - Okay. And I'll give you a nice massage, okay? - No! (grunting) Kill you! Kill you for cheating on me. Come on, Mommy. I wanna play. Don't ever leave me. Mommy, I'll be a good boy. Don't leave me. Mommy, I'll be a good boy, I promise. - Behave yourself! (mumbling) How many times have I told you to behave yourself? How many times have I told you to clean up your room? - I'm sorry, Mommy. I won't do it again, I promise - No. If you're a good boy. I'll make you some dinner. Now you behave yourself. You be quiet. There's no food in the refrigerator, Paul. Now you stay here. You be a good boy. And your mommy's going to go out and get some food. Okay? - Okay, Mommy. Mommy? Don't leave. I'll get it for you. You stay here. While I go to the store. Is that okay, Mommy? (phone ringing) (phone beeps) - Hello, Jennifer. Are you there? - Hello? Can you hear me? - Jennifer, is that you? You sound funny. - Help me. He's got me. - What are you talking about? Who's got you? - Stingray's got me. I'm in the old Graycore warehouse on 10th and 18th Street. Call the police! - I'm on my way. - Hurry. - [Woman On Phone] Metropolitan police. May I help you? - Yes, please listen carefully. My name is Kristi Jones and I need you to get a message to Sergeant Nick DeMarco immediately. Tell him that Stingray is holding Jennifer captive at the old Graycore warehouse on 10th and 18th. You got it? That's the old Graycore warehouse on 10th and 18th. - I'm back. I got everything you wanted. This is gonna be great. Mommy? How? (grunting) - Jennifer, run! (shouting) - Freeze, police! (suspenseful music) (gunshots banging) - Nick. - Mike. Mike, hang in there, buddy. Come on, hang in there. Breathe. Breathe, Mike. Dammit, breathe! Breathe. Breathe! Breathe, bastard. (solemn music) (knocking on door) - Come in. - Hi. - Hi. - How you feeling? - Oh, I'm a bit sore, but the doctors tell me I'm alive, so. - You look good. - Well, you look great. And I brought you some chicken soup. I know that will make you feel better. - Thank you. So, did you find him yet? - Not yet. - Yeah, but don't worry. We'll get him. - Jennifer, if you need anything at all, I have an officer on the door, he can call me anytime. - Just be careful. - I want someone on this door 24 hours. No visitors. - Yes, sir. 24 Hours? What about my lunch? - How's the hand feeling, Kristi? - Doing better. - Good. - I'm gonna kill him, Nick. (suspenseful music) - Don't worry, we'll get him. These damn elevators take forever. - Let's take the stairs. - What's up, doc? - Oop. - What? - I forgot my sunglasses. - Oh, let's go get 'em. - Something's wrong. - Come on. (suspenseful music) - He's dead. Go that way! - There he is! There he is! - Drop the gun. Drop the gun. Now. (grunting and shouting) - Keep an eye out for you, Stingray. - Yeah, see ya. (tense music) - Well, kid, we got him. He's not gonna be hurting anybody anymore. But I guess you already know that. I love you, Karen, and I miss you so much. - You okay? Kristi, now this whole thing is over, I was... Well, it's up to you, but I was wondering if you're gonna stay in the Red Dragons. 'Cause I'd worry about you a lot, and I don't want to- - Shh. I'm not gonna be needing those anymore. Bye. - Ooh. - Hey Kristi. Do you think we should really apply to college? - I told you, man, our IQs are too high. (laughing) - Go ahead and laugh. I enrolled you guys. You all start Monday. - What about you? - Not me. - Yes you. I enrolled you too. - All right. - All right! Yeah! (solemn music)
