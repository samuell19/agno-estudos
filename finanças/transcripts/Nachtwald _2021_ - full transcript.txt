I'm so sick of waiting for good things to come happiness is like a fugitive that's always on the run now I'm stepping from the doorway I'm done hiding from the rain I'm going to that place where no one knows my name Headed out into the wild God only knows what we will find Hold on Gas Countdown starts T-minus 5 Take off! Is it true that we're all made of star dust? Every coal or oxygen atom in our body actually comes from the stars that exploded up there billions of years ago Boom Cool Do you know what that means? That you can achieve anything you want because you're a star Don't worry about what people say You have to dream as much as you can The dreams you have now you can never betray Promise?

Gentlemen, ladies Don't you really understand? This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance for St. John As soon as we have opened this cave people will only come to us I even made a few budget estimates for a cable car for a panorama restaurant and a hotel down here in town Dr. Haller That all sounds very interesting Yes I actually have one more important question Of course, Mr. Mayor Can you tell us what you're wearing under your bathrobe today? Dad, come on, let's go Please Hey What are you doing there? I'm making a little space I don't know I don't know I don't know I wanted to ask you something anyway Would it be okay for you if St. John moves in with us? What about dad? Oh Paul The police I don't give a shit what the police said Thomas has been missing for over a year There is no proof that he is no longer alive Dad is dead, Paul I miss him too Every day You know, at one point he was overjoyed and wanted to hug the whole world and then again he said to me it feels like he would stick his feet to his neck in such sticky tea Sometimes I think he decided himself that he doesn't want to live like this anymore Shit 5 years in math and physics Are you crazy? There was really nothing to do I'm sorry, Max I'm afraid the gym is not for you Yeah, I'm sorry too and I deserve to be judged Man, these women Hey, what's up? Come on in, loser So we can still meet after school I don't get it If it was up to me, I'd love to I could be with you all day Are you sure Paul agrees with that? We'll have to part ways at some point, right? If you could help Paul Do you also want to sedate him with medication or what? I thought we were going to therapy Come on, we've been through it all The only therapist in the area is an idiot But Vili won't sleep and at school... I know You think I don't worry every day that he'll be like Thomas You have to dream as much as you can You have to dream as much as you can How else can all the great and world-changing things become reality if no one dares to imagine them You have to come right away It has to be somewhere up there behind the hills It has to be somewhere up there behind the hills The Osulenberg And probably the biggest undiscovered cave in Germany And we both will find it But we have to be careful We have to be careful Because the people here have no imagination at all Do you understand?
