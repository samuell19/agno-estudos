Great! Looks like you're all fine. Field trip, field trip. Field trip! Yeah, a field trip. Field trip! Field trip, field trip. Field trip! You wanna go? Rinko, time to get up. Hey! Come on! Morning. Morning. Worked until late again? Yeah. When different organizations try to work together, friction is inevitable. Here you are! Thanks. You look happy, Hiyori. Another field trip? Yeah, a migratory bird bird-band survey. In Hokkaido, with a group from Teito University. Hokkaido? I envy you. It's way out in the sticks, so it's a tough journey. I see. Take care. I will. Bon appétit! Bon appétit! Looks delicious. See you! Hey, Hiyori. What? Would it bother you if I became prime minister? What do you mean? Oh, nothing. See you. See you. September 10th. Sunny. As I left to go on the field trip, my wife asked me a profound question. She avoided answering when I asked about it, but I'm sure that one day, I'll remember that exchange... as the moment it all began. As her husband of 12 years now, that's what my gut tells me. Look, a tundra bean goose! A tundra bean goose! However, things changed much more rapidly than I expected. While I was away for 10 days out of cellphone range, she changed the course... of this country's history. September 21st. Sunny. "105 missed calls from 0902510332" "9 missed calls from Rinko" Huh? You're Mr. Soma? Hiyori Soma? Yes What's your reaction to your wife becoming PM? How do you feel? Are you really the scion of Soma Global? Well? Excuse me. Let me pass. Excuse me. No more questions! This man is a private citizen. Let's go. Who are you? This way. Get in. Okay Ow! Ow! They're coming! I couldn't get hold of you, so I was worried. To your workplace? Erm, yes. A phone for you, so this doesn't happen again. Always carry it. The Orthogenesis Party? And you are? Fujinomiya, Orthogenesis Party, now a cabinet PR officer. You work with Rinko? I'll be handling your public relations. To avoid scenes with the press, don't go anywhere without our knowledge. PR for the cabinet? What does the press want with me? Haven't you seen the news? Rinko Soma, 314 votes. And so in accordance with Article 18 Paragraph 2 of the rules of this house, Rinko Soma is hereby elected to the post of prime minister. Today, my wife became prime minister. The first ever female prime minister of Japan. And so today, I became the first ever... first gentleman of Japan. "First Gentleman" I'll come fetch you this evening. He's here! Mr. Soma is here! He's here? Yes! I'm back. Huh? Where are you all? Good morning. Ready Congratulations! Congratulations, Soma! What is this? Yeah! You're the first lady No, the first gentleman! For the Soma family, and for us, this is a very proud moment. Oh. Don't just say "Oh". Your wife has become prime minister. Be more excited! I've only just learned about it on the news. It hasn't sunk in yet. Huh? Everyone, look at this! Ta-dah! I got the extra edition! Extra! Of course. I wanna see it. "Rinko Soma (42) graduated in law from the University of Tokyo." "As part of her degree, she studied at Harvard..." "under the Nobel prize-winning economist Harold Vermillion." Let me read it. "The youngest, and first ever female prime minister." Why did such an amazing person marry Mr. Soma? Yeah. I wonder. What a stellar achievement! She's beautiful. Yeah, amazing. Congratulations, Prime Minister. Thank you. This is Oh Thank you! Congratulations, Prime Minister. Thank you, Mr. Hara. It's all thanks to you. The hard part lies ahead. We have lots of work to do. I, Kuro Hara, will work my fingers to the bone for the Soma administration. I look forward to working with you. Excuse me. Please inform me whenever Mr. Hara makes a move. Understood. He's the key to this coalition. Congratulations, Prime Minister. Thanks. Please prepare yourself. From today, you'll be the busiest person in Japan. And you should prepare yourself, Shimazaki. You'll be the busiest secretary in Japan. Zenda Institute for Ornithology. Sorry, Soma isn't here at the moment. Zenda Institute for Ornithology. Zenda Institute for Ornithology. We can't get any work done. I'm so sorry. What will I do? Mr. Soma, it's for you! If it's the press, say no for me. It's your mother, Takako Soma. She says you aren't answering your cellphone. Please tell her I'm not here! Just hang up! Hang up! Milady of Otowa, please mind your step. Thank you for your generous donations. We're very, very grateful. I should have visited you to thank you, but I'm extremely delighted that you're visiting us! Think nothing of it. It's simply a tax-reduction strategy. Even so, we're very grateful. And where is Hiyori? Soma, what are you doing? Your mother is here. Mom! I told you not to come here. I'm working now. I'm the one who should be angry. Why didn't you say my daughter-in-law was becoming prime minister? I didn't know about it either. Rinko will be selecting her cabinet. As the chair of Soma Global, I have to... tell her my opinion. You can't do that! I pity him. Come on, let's go, Hiyori. Where to? The National Diet. What? Japan's first ever first gentleman, Hiyori Soma. Why didn't you dress smarter for the cameras? But Rinko shouldn't just think of her own appearance. Tell her to take more care of her husband. Rinko has nothing to do with it. You appearing on TV will make Tayori jealous. As the first gentleman, your younger brother is attracting attention. Will he be involved in the company? What about Hiyori? I'm the face of Soma Global. How dare you be so rude! CEO, a photo. I can picture him. Give me a break. I hate all that kind of stuff. And as for Rinko, I always thought you'd chosen an energetic and outgoing wife, but I never thought she'd go and become prime minister! Excuse me. Hello? I told you to go nowhere without me. Ms. Fujinomiya, how did you I'm tracking you via GPS. GPS!? Where are you going? To the National Diet, with my mother. You're joking! Turn around immediately! I can't do that immediately. Who is it? A cabinet PR officer. Is she saying you aren't allowed to go somewhere with your mother? No. Hiyori, are you listening? Erm, sorry, erm, I'll call you back. Excuse me. Let's go back, Mom. You thought I was serious? We're just going to drive past to show respect to your wife. What? Look. It doesn't look too bad from here. I'm very sorry. Why on earth are you wearing that? Mom said I should. For the cameras. It's too high-end. You'll look out of touch. Please don't do that! You need to be aware of your image. As the first gentleman, the eyes of the public are on you. Everywhere, all the time. OK. I'll take you to your house. Where's Rinko? I want to see her. She's busy meeting her coalition partners about forming the cabinet. I see. Come on, we have to hurry. But I don't have any plans. To pick up my son. I'm a single mother. Oh, sorry. A police guard? Since when? Hello. Hey, hey! Stop right there! You can't just go in there. Where's your ID? I'm the first gentleman! I'm so tired! So tired. So tired. I have to lie down! So tired. Hello! Marriage? What do you think? I don't think it'll work. You know, the life you dream of... and my dream of making people happy through politics... aren't a good fit. It's fine. I knew that. Don't sweat it. More tea? Rinko, please marry me! No! Shut up! Marry me! No, this is Is it really impossible? I know nothing about politics, and I'm only good at birdwatching. But even so... I'll support your dream with all my might. I don't know if I can make you happy, but I'm sure we can become happy together. Please... marry me! That's what I love about you, Hiyori. Hiyori, are you awake? Rinko? You passed out by the front door. I was going to call an ambulance, but Shimazaki stopped me. Sorry. You saw your mom today? How did you know? That suit. It isn't your style! How was Hokkaido? It was great! Thanks. A tundra bean goose. It's endangered, and a natural monument of Japan. The first sighting this season. Really? Come here. What? This bird. So cute! You're really good at sketching, you know? Thanks. Rinko, you're the prime minister now? Yeah. Must've been a shock for you. You looked fantastic on TV. Congratulations. Everyone's all "She's a woman!" It's so disrespectful. I don't see it as a woman becoming prime minister. I mean, obviously you're the prime minister, but you not being a man... is just a coincidence, isn't it? You're right. Yeah. That's so like you! Oh yeah! What? Today, you became... prime minister. It's worth commemorating. Prime Minister, please add something. Like what? Anything you like. Alright. What's that? The Orthogenesis Party logo. Oh, like this! Didn't you recognize it? Unbelievable! Well? That's cool! It's like you once told me. Birds fly against the wind. That's when I decided... the party's symbol had to be birds. Flying straight, forever and ever. My dream has just begun. I have to fly... much higher and further. And you can. I know you can do it. Thanks. That's just what I needed to hear right now. Looks like that cookie logo. What do you mean? Sorry! September 22nd. In Japan, all eyes were on the inauguration of the Soma Cabinet. Rinko founded the Orthogenesis Party eight years ago. They had few seats, but worked tirelessly, waiting for their big chance. A helping hand came from The Public Sentiment Party. A Diet member who left the party which had ruled Japan for decades. Kuro Hara. They co-operated and made a strong showing in the election. Thanks to Kuro Hara, Rinko became prime minister of a coalition government. I have no words to describe how beautiful Rinko looked today. To reduce greenhouse gas emissions to zero. We urgently need more investment in renewable energy. I like the way she doesn't mince words. Supporting today's generation... is the only way to stop the birthrate falling. She's great! I love "Sorin"! Radical reform of the tax and welfare system. A consumption tax increase is unavoidable. The Consumption Tax Increase Bill was expected to inflame public opinion, but the Soma administration's approval rating is still over 60%. October 28th. Cloudy. Here we go. Hiyori, smile. Let them pass! Stay back, please! Let them pass! Stay back! Don't get in their way! They've increased in the past month. The Rinkoites were inevitable, but I didn't expect the Hiyoristas. I'm sorry. But why me too? The whole package. Package? They support you as a couple. It means the public likes you. It's a good thing. Sorry about the early start. With a child I live in a dormitory nearby, so I have plenty of time to take him to daycare. I see. I got divorced soon after he was born, so it was tough. People are hard on single mothers. Think how much you're inconveniencing everyone! When he was ill, I had to leave work early, or take days off. I was being pressured to resign, but Rinko stepped in and saved me. I'm very sorry. A word? I need your help. Would you work for me? She was my savior! Women want to have children, but can't afford to. They have to give up their careers, or juggle work and childcare. Rinko is working really hard to solve those problems, so I want to help her in any way I can. The moving day has been decided. You're leaving the dorm? No, you're moving to the prime minister's official residence. Next Sunday. I'll help you move. I don't wanna move house. Hello Java sparrow! Hi. Mr. Soma, you're alone? Yeah. What about lunch? I've been told not to go out. You've just got back? Yes, the stork chicks at Johoku Zoo are ready to leave the nest. I was preparing their new enclosure. You're working hard. A warbling white-eye! So cute! How did you get so close? A lot of different birds visit my garden. See So cute! Wow! It's just like the director said. The estate you inherited from your grandfather includes a forest. A great spot for scientific birdwatching in the middle of Tokyo! Yeah, that's right. Mr. Soma! Quick, come here! Leave your food! Quick Their behavioral pattern is different from yesterday. They're beginning to move south. But it isn't migration season. Huh? What are you all doing here? The geese are starting to migrate. Migrate? How come? Can't tell from here. I'll go to Hokkaido, if it's alright with you, Director. No. Hatagaya will go this time. Me? The first gentleman going away for 10 days, The press will say you're splitting up. Sorry, I can't allow it. Hatagaya, you'll go. Welcome back! Right, here goes. I'm gonna tell her. Welcome back! I'm home. Hi. Still awake? The thing is Sorry, I need some water. Sorry. What's up? Ms. Fujinomiya said we're moving house. Oh, that. You don't want to? Well, the thing is, to me, this house is like a research station. I'd like to talk about how we each do our jobs Sorry. Hello? Shimazaki? Who told you to do that? If we act weak now, all our efforts will go to waste. Good night. November 6th. Cloudy. Moving day. Take care of yourselves. Why isn't Rin-chan here too to say you're moving? She owes us that courtesy. Rinko's very busy. I'm busy too! Unlike you, you bird-brain. Let's talk seriously. Rin-chan is going too far, isn't she? Too far? The tax increase and welfare reform. It's no joke! Ikushima of Yotsuba Heavy Industries has been complaining to me about her. She should consult with us before announcing wild schemes. She isn't working for Soma. You don't get it. If she doesn't accommodate big business, we'll have mass unemployment. She's considered the economy too That's enough. Tayori, you're making me lose my appetite. Sorry. I get too passionate talking about the future of Soma Global. Hiyori, until now, you've been blessed not having to deal with politics or business. But that won't do anymore. Your wife is the prime minister now. Yes Listen up. Excuse me. I don't approve of phones at the dining table. Tadokoro. Hello? Hello? Hiyori? Hiyori, can you hear me? It'll be hard to get hold of you once you've moved, so today, I'd like your full attention. I'm very sorry! What's with that outfit? I had to go play golf with my mom. Where's Ms. Fujinomiya? Her shift finished, so she went home. You should apologize to her. She was extremely mad. Of course. I'll show you around. This way. Sorry. That's the living room. How was your trip here? Wow! So that's the prime minister's office. They're to counteract terrorism. You're fully secure. I'll show you the shelter later. Good. Lastly, this is the bedroom. Ha Don't worry, the mattresses are new and unused. That isn't what I Never mind. Thank you. Excuse me. So far apart! November 7th. Cloudy. Mornings at the official residence are so dreary. Winter birds should be making their appearance, but there's no forest here for me to observe them. "Prime Minister Taylor of Canada is in Japan on an official visit." Rinko, you've cut your hair! You've only just noticed? We never see each other. She's very busy, so it can't be helped. This will cheer you up. I've brought you lunch. For me? Thanks. Can I open it? Sure. How come? This is for me? I just can't stand seeing you sigh as you munch your bean buns every day. Octopus-shaped sausages! I haven't had these for years! And the omelet looks fluffy and delicious. It is! Really? Yeah, it's yummy! Delicious! I'll be sure to return this favor someday. Thank you. Actually, I have a request right now. Sure. Can I go to your house in Gokokuji? Ha? The director told me you have the Givry Archimedes Encyclopedia of Birds. I'd like to quote it in a research paper, so may I scan it? Oh, I see. That's fine. We should do it soon, right? Yes. OK, let's go after I've eaten. No, I can't. What's wrong. My PR officer told me not to do anything unscheduled. Even going home for work? Oh, you're right. I'm going as part of my job. I'm just going as part of my job. Wow! These are all yours? The complete set of Illustrated Bird Flight! This field guide is out of print and impossible to find! So cute! The Archimedes! Careful, it's heavy. Thank you. This is amazing! Sorry, I couldn't help myself. That's only natural. I feel a little hot. Could you open a window? Oh, of course. Sure. What a wonderful garden. I wish I lived in a house like this. Thanks. I envy Rinko. Ms. Ito She's so beautiful and clever, and she has such a kind husband. We're both women, so why are we so different? You're a talented ornithologist. Do I have no worth except as an ornithologist? That's not what I'm saying. I might quit working at the institute. My family home is in Hokkaido. My dad died at an early age, so we always struggled. I had no luxuries, but I wanted to be an ornithologist. To earn money as a student, I did whatever I had to. It was really tough. But my mom has lost her health. I have to pay my brother's tuition, and pay back my student loan. My salary won't cover it. I don't want to quit. I don't want to stop doing research work with you. Ms. Ito Sorry about that. Forget what just happened. Let's go back. I'll call a taxi. OK. Huh? Five days after Ms. Ito's tearful confession. December 7th. Rain. Zenda Institute for Ornithology. Just a moment, please. Soma, it's for you. Kuro Hara! Excuse me. Mr. Hara, what are you doing here? This is a confidential matter. Do you recollect this? Yes. I recollect it, but we didn't do anything wrong. We just went to get a book. 10 million yen. That's what the journalist who took this wants. You fell for it hook, line, and sinker. He's always been sniffing around. He has no connection with the prime minister, so he came to me, saying I, as a coalition partner, would be hurt too if it came out. He's sized you up. As the scion of Soma Global, you can easily afford that sum. Let's go. Wait! Stop! Should I pay, or would it just make matters worse? Hiyori. It's no exaggeration to say the future of this country is in your hands. Don't worry, I won't tell the prime minister. Let's keep it between ourselves. Bye. Are you alright? Fetch a towel! Why are you so wet? Thanks. You're soaked. How come? You fell down? For the press, tomorrow morning Has something happened? Minister Akiko Yukuyama is alleged to have accepted illegal donations. This is a heavy blow for... the Soma administration, which purports to promote clean politics. The prime minister's responsibility is Please don't worry. Sorry, Hiyori. Go to bed. We need thorough checks on all the ministers. Yes. Mr. Hara's secretary has just called. I mustn't cause Rinko any more trouble. May I go to the bank at lunchtime today? Of course. I won't stop you doing things like that. Thank you. Welcome. In order to give everyone in Japan hope for the future We are calling for this tax increase. This scandal is deplorable, but it is a chance to show our resolve. In order to earn the public's trust, I promise to make all flows of money more transparent and above board. Hey, Hiyorista! Wait! Wait! Listen to me! Stop! No! Stop! No! Wait! Ha-ha-ha! Stop it! Wait! You're Hisashi Abe, right? The one who took that photo! So what if I did? I'm begging you! Please delete the photo! I don't want to cause Rinko any trouble. I'm begging you. Please delete it! And the money? I can't pay you. Delete the photo for free? Are you kidding me! I can't protect Rinko with money. I'll do anything! Please! What the heck? I'm nothing but a useless, pitiful fool of a man, but... I'm begging you! Please delete it! Please! You really think begging me will work? I can't live on good intentions! Bring me a different story I can make money on, then! You'll do anything, right? That's what you just said. Well? Stop right there! A clear case of blackmail. I'm a cabinet PR officer. Let him go... or I'll call the police. Look, the thing is Ms. Fujinomiya! Ow, ow, ow! What's all this? Rinko! You're going to tell me exactly what's going on. Why here? Outside, we'd attract attention. You can't be working alone. Who's behind all this? I won't tell you for free. I'll call the police, then. Alright, alright! Kuro Hara. But you threatened him, didn't you? You're joking! He's the one who proposed this scheme. Trapping the first gentleman. Whether you paid the 10 million or not, it'd be in the scandal sheets in three days time. What would Mr. Hara gain from that? He wants to topple me from power. Yes, exactly. But Mr. Hara is your ally, isn't he? All Hara has ever wanted is to become prime minister. He installs the popular Rinko Soma, and gets her to increase consumption tax. And just when public anger against the tax rise reaches a peak, he pulls the rug out from under her. This little scandal is just a prelude to turn public opinion against her. He's really devious. Even his name... sounds like "devious". "Kuro Hara", "devious". The prime minister! Yeah, it's her! The prime minister! Go play soccer! You idiot! Go away! Hisashi Abe. I thought I'd heard of you. The first one to dig into the previous administration's financial scandals. How did you know? I used to admire your journalism, but now you've lowered yourself to muckraking? You shouldn't demean your own talent like this. If you want scoops about the prime minister, make an appointment. We'll await your call. Thank you. This way. She's so cool! Sorry to keep you. By the way, Hiyori. According to the GPS records, you were at the institute all day. Care to explain? Prime Minister! If we'd known you were coming, we'd have come out and welcomed you! Sorry, this won't take long. Welcome. It's just like I told you, so Be quiet, Hiyori. Please May I have a word with you? Rui Ito. Let's talk about your childhood. Ha! Hiyori told me what you said. What made your childhood so tough? What did you want adults to do? And what problems do you have now? Tell me your experiences. I want to create a world in which nobody... has to suffer as you have. That's why I took this job. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Prime Minister! When did you first suspect Hara? I was always wary of him. The most ambitious and scheming person in politics. I couldn't ask for a better ally. Or a worse enemy than him. When the photos aren't published, he'll see it as a declaration of war. Sorry to cause this bother. It was gonna happen sooner or later. Things are clear now, that's all. I have no desire to cling on to power, you know? It's just that becoming prime minister was the shortest path... to achieving my vision. But I won't let go without a fight. I haven't achieved anything yet. That's my official position as Prime Minister. Personally, as Rinko Soma, how dare that old man use my Hiyori like that! I'm gonna win. Watch me do it, Hiyori. And you will. I know you can do it. First day of the year, January 1st. Rinko's first New Year as prime minister. We spent the morning... at the Palace, greeting the Emperor, Empress, and Imperial Family. The afternoon was hectic, greeting... those connected with the administration, and Diet members. And then Please take a seat. This won't take long, so we'll stand. He'll be here soon, so please. Please come in and sit. Now, you're the prime minister. Thank you for coming to my humble abode. I'd like to thank you for the way you... treated my husband. I'm greatly obliged to your kindness. I'm so glad everything was cleared up. Before the debate on the Consumption Tax Increase Bill, we can't allow anything to tarnish your image. Before the Diet session begins, I will explain to the public the outline of our tax bill, welfare reform, and economic measures. I'm confident the contents will meet with their approval. I've been thinking long and hard during this holiday season, with an eye on this country as a whole. Your consumption tax increase is something I can't support. Excuse me, but... it's to rebuild national finances and social security. I thought you shared our opinion. Well, that's what I said, but the coalition hasn't agreed to it. The Public Sentiment Party manifesto said nothing about a tax rise. Without the PSP's support, it will be difficult for the coalition to get the bill passed. Perhaps. I'm sure you're thinking beyond that. Meaning? You'll leave the coalition, and submit a no-confidence motion. That would be a big step. Excuse me for being so paranoid. Enough politics for today. A drink, Prime Minister? Thank you. Will it be OK? What? The no-confidence motion. If the PSP leaves the coalition and submits a no-confidence motion, going on the numbers, it's likely to be passed. What will you do? I have no choice. When the time comes... I'll just play my trump card. And the regular Diet session began. Mr. Hara! There are rumors of friction with Prime Minister Soma. It's too soon to raise consumption tax. It's true that the prime minister disagrees with me. Just as Rinko predicted, Kuro Hara left the coalition. June 21st. The Diet session ended. This house is dissolved. Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Rinko played her trump card. Before he could submit the no-confidence motion, she called an election. She launched a once in a lifetime summer campaign, and the election battle began. Please vote for Rinko Soma. I promise to never waste a single yen of your hard-earned tax money. No consumption tax rise! The government's vision won't fill the bellies of the people! Thank you for your support! I'm Rinko Soma! Thank you! I'm Kuro Hara. Thank you. The coalition government... led by Rinko Soma is pushing for a tax rise and welfare reform. The Public Sentiment Party and the Civil Rights Party... are opposing the rise and prioritizing the economy. Japan's first ever first gentleman... Hiyori Soma is here asking for your support! Smile more. Wave at the kids, too. Hiyori! A tax rise in this recession? What the heck is your wife thinking? Get out of here. Don't park in front of my store! Just keep on smiling. Rinko has to visit the regions. You're in charge of her home turf. OK. Hi! Welcome back! Soma, you know I All of us here fully support Rinko. Go for it! Thank you. We've bought you lunch. Eat it. Thank you! But it's against the Election Law, so I'll eat it. What? You must be so tired. Sit down and take a rest. A massage. If you need to take paid leave or whatever, just let me know, alright? Sorry. It's breeding season and It's fine. It's good for me. I get all the juicy work. Kubozuka, how's the election outlook? It doesn't look good. Really? Don't lose spirit! Whatever happens, I'm behind Sorin all the way! Wow! I believe she can change our future. You look cute. Hooray, hooray! Sorin! Thanks. You can do better than that! Please vote for Rinko Soma! Hooray, hooray! We're gonna win! You idiot! It's a terrible manifesto! A terrible blow for big business, which has built our economy! Raising corporation tax... will mean companies will leave Japan and go abroad. I'm so disappointed in Rin-chan! But she's promoting trade. Exports are up, and so are stocks Raising tax is like throwing a bucket of cold water on the economy! The Orthogenesis Party is now an enemy of business. Do something about your wife! She's not involved in our business! Yes she is! Hiyori. I'm not stupid, you know? You shouldn't come here again until after the election. The first gentlemen regularly visiting the chair of Soma Global... isn't good for anyone. Yeah So please leave. I'm home. You're back! Sorry, hi. You must be exhausted. You're not used to this. No, I'm fine. I'm tired! I'm so tired! But I'm fine, really. I want to do anything I can for you. Thanks. I have to be on top form to support him tomorrow. Yeah. Why don't you take off that sash? Oh yeah! Have you lost weight? Have I? I know you're busy, but eat properly, OK? Thanks. We'll eliminate all poverty and prejudice! A society where kids can be raised easily! That's always been the principle of the Orthogenesis Party! Shimazaki's standing for election. Yes, Rinko insisted on it. He hesitated at first, but she persuaded him. I really admire him. He's a good candidate, but it's a tight race. His main opponent from the PSP... is Kambe, who was Kuro Hara's private secretary. We have to win. I'm Rinko Soma. This country needs more politicians from this young man's generation. Please give him the power to open up our future. Please vote for Kozan Shimazaki! Prime Minister! Thank you. Good luck. Excuse me. Rinko? Rinko! Ms. Fujinomiya! Rinko! Rinko! Rinko! Pregnant? I'm in my third month. I'm already 43. I thought it'd never happen. Rinko, this is great! Wonderful news! Yeah! Yeah! Huh? But Don't make that face. It's fine. Other world leaders have become pregnant and given birth, so I have role models. In this country where women are discriminated and with a falling birthrate, this pregnancy has great meaning. If I win the election and stay in office, I'll be taking maternity leave, but the law allows for a temporary replacement. The birth is still far away. I can't announce it yet, but I can prepare for it. I have work to do, and a new life to raise. I'm not giving up. First, I have an election to win. Yeah. That's right. This is it? Yeah, look. You see it? Here it is. Rinko worked even harder than before, just as she said she would. Thank you! Rinko. Rinko! I have soda water, a sports drink, and still water. Soda water. Here. It's refreshingly citrus-flavored. Thanks. Can you eat anything? No, I'll just throw up. I see. Anyway, stay hydrated. Ms. Fujinomiya, anything I can do? No. Hiyori, please hold my hand. Sure. I'm fine. Morning sickness means that everything's alright. Ms. Fujinomiya. Let's leave in three minutes. Rest a little while longer. I have to go. Alright, Ms. Fujinomiya? Understood. We were anxious as we entered the final stage of the election. Election day is very soon. Today we're making our final appeal. Don't give up on Japan's future! Hiyori. Come with me. The Prime Minister. Hiyorin! Everyone, thank you for gathering here on such a hot day. The reason I dissolved the Diet and called an election... is to ensure this country doesn't move backwards, and that we all move forward together, as one. Welfare, energy, the economy. We need to face all of our problems. Radical reform is essential! Yeah. I have chosen the thorny path of raising consumption tax. In order to not burden future generations, and to create a society where anyone can access welfare, a tax rise is a tough but certain path. Right now, this country is trying to reboot and be reborn. Each and every one of you deserves a future. We'll never give up on that! Please trust me... and my colleagues! Let's all look ahead and keep on going. Let's change this country, the future, all of us together! Sorin! Thank you! Thank you! Rinko! Hiyori, you worked so hard! I did! Thank you! The day of reckoning, July 30th. Election day. Kozan Shimazaki is projected to win! The Orthogenesis Party has now secured 157 seats, giving the coalition government a clear majority. Hooray! Thank you! I just wasn't good enough. However, it remains to be seen how the government's policy will be evaluated. August 4th. Rinko formed her second cabinet. Her face that day... appeared on the cover of an American financial magazine... as one of the world's most influential leaders. Everyone believed Prime Minister Soma would make rapid progress. However Hello? Ms. Fujinomiya? Hiyori, come here now! Rinko has been rushed to hospital. A threatened miscarriage? Well, the baby is still in its mother's womb, but there's a high risk of miscarriage. Malnutrition due to morning sickness, anemia due to overwork, and abnormal vaginal bleeding. She's on a drip, and is confined to bed. But she has work Yes. I'm aware of that. But in order to protect both their lives, she needs complete rest. I see. Until when? She may recover in a week, or it could take several months. Even if she leaves hospital, she needs to rest until the birth. Hiyori? How do you feel? I'm fine. Sorry for disturbing your work. I've talked to the doctor. I have to be here for a few days. Officially, it's because of overwork. Why did I have to collapse right now, just after forming a cabinet? I'm useless. Rinko The Welfare Reform Bill is taking shape. Without that bill, a tax rise is pointless. I have to review parliamentary privilege and the budget. Shimazaki got elected, so I have to train my new secretary. I'm so busy Rinko. I'm worried about your health. For the baby too, you need rest. I know. Inside my womb... is another life. Some action by me... could put our baby at risk. I'm constantly... terrified! But I'm the prime minister. A manifesto is a contract with the people. I can't betray all those who believe in me. I have to keep going. I can't turn back. Rinko. Say what you always do. Tell me I can do it. Please say it! Rinko, calm down. Hiyori, please Calm down. Rinko! Prime Minister, you need rest. Prime Minister! Please lie down. Hiyori. Be a dear and fetch my papers and tablet, would you? But Please. In order to protect both their lives, she needs complete rest. Anything I can do? No. Say what you always do. Tell me I can do it. Darn! Darn! What can I do? What can I do? The prime minister's pregnant? How did you know? It's been leaked to the press. 4 month of pregnancy, stay or leave the cabinet? Cabinet formed for 1 month only, how will the Diet... Shocked by the news, members in the party are also confused I was so surprised! Sorin, congratulations! Even pregnant, she can still do her job. With a threatened miscarriage, she needs complete rest, for the baby's sake. Can a prime minister take maternity leave? An online opinion poll. 11% say you should stay, 31% say you should resign, and 58% can't decide. Who leaked it? It's way too soon. It's me. I leaked it. I wanted to... change the world with you. But I couldn't stand it. You protected me, and I did this awful thing. I'm very sorry. Thank you for everything. Goodbye. Ms. Fujinomiya I'm the one who's awful. I'd like to be alone for a while. I'll buy you something easy to digest. Thanks. I've caused you nothing but trouble. Huh? Me becoming prime minister... means you've had to rearrange your whole life. You can't do your research. You love field trips, but you can't go anymore. Hiyori, Ms. Fujinomiya, the baby. I've been hurting everyone who's closest to me. I didn't realize. And even when I did, I pretended not to. Rinko Making people happy through politics? Who was I kidding? Could you call Mr. Ozu and Shimazaki? I, Rinko Soma, have decided to resign as prime minister. Mr. Ozu. Shimazaki. Hiyori. You've given me so much support. I'm very grateful to you. Right then. I'll prepare your resignation, and begin selection of your successor. Two weeks later, September 29th. Cloudy. Prime Minister Soma left hospital yesterday. A press conference will be held at 11 AM today. It is thought that she'll make a statement about her future. Her office is frantic. Sooner than I thought. Rinko! Please don't quit! Is this really it? Unfortunately, it can't be helped. Hooray, hooray, Sorin. Looks like I've missed my chance to take a peek inside the Residence. Mom Shouldn't you be at her side at the press conference? She said I don't have to. She's already told me how she feels. She's such a difficult woman. Why can't she lean on her husband even at a time like this? I voted for her, to see what kind of future she'd create for this country. I didn't want to watch this kind of farce. But I told you before. I'm not stupid, you know? A married couple having a baby. I don't see what all the fuss is about. What's with this country? I hope she doesn't regret this. Well? That's cool! It's like you once told me. Birds fly against the wind. Flying straight, forever and ever. I have to fly much higher and further. And you can. I know you can do it. And you will. I know you can do it. Tell me I can do it. Making people happy through politics? Who was I kidding? Prime Minister, it's time. Excuse me! Let me through! Please! Hiyori, this way! Come on! Excuse me. Show your pass It's fine! Sorry! I'm just here to meet my wife! Please let me see my wife! Thanks! Hiyori! Go! Stop! Stop! Calm down! Let go! Ow! Ow! Stay down! Don't move! Ow! Ow! Don't move! Let me go! What's this commotion for? The Prime Minister. Everyone, I Wait! I want to say this while you're still prime minister. I fully support your choice. For choosing to protect our child, I'm full of respect and gratitude from the bottom of my heart. But I'm worried that one day, you'll look back... and regret this. I don't want you to throw away everything you've worked for. So make no mistake. This isn't a retreat. It's a brave step forward! Who says a bird who rests can never fly again? Women Everyone has the right to spread their wings again! You're the one who has put your heart and soul... into making society accept that! Even if you take a break, many others will carry your vision forward. Your dreams, your hopes... have reached a lot of people... who are working to achieve them. Why should you be the only one not to benefit from that future? You said you'd caused me trouble, but I was dependent on your strength. It's OK if some days you can't cope. That's what I'm here for. I'm pretty useless, but I'll never give up on the path to our happiness! This is the next step. We can spread our wings and fly as many times as we like! That future You made that future possible! Who let a member of the public in? I was going to say... everything you've just said! Let me introduce... the love of my life, my husband Hiyori Soma. Bravo! First gentleman! Everyone, please settle down. I, Rinko Soma, have decided to resign as prime minister. Creating a society where women can both work and raise children. That was in my manifesto. I don't want this resignation to turn that into a lie. My promise is embodied in the Welfare Reform Bill. I firmly believe it will be fulfilled. Since then, the world gradually changed. Good morning. Morning. Rinko's Welfare Reform Bill... was enacted without problem under Ozu, the new prime minister. Rinko's vision was carried forward. It is rumored that... working behind the scenes to get the bill passed... was none other than Kuro Hara of the PSP. On the day he let me into the press conference, he said Until I become prime minister, I need you to carry on a little bit longer. And gave us a devious smile. I guess he was our ally once more, but I couldn't really tell if he was. Mama, come on! Ms. Fujinomiya responded to Rinko's fervent requests, and went back to work for the OP. She's still a proud working mother. Mr. Soma. You're known as the brother of the famous Hiyori Soma. Will he be involved in the business? I'm the face of Soma Global. Stop asking that! CEO, a photo. Well, some people never change. As for us Field trip, field trip. Field trip, field trip. Field trip! Yeah, a field trip. Huh? Hiyori, come here. Hiyori! Yes. What's up? It's dripping wet! Sorry, my hands are full. It's fine. I filled in the daycare contact book. Thanks. Ready for your field trip? Yeah. Papa, field trip? Yeah, a field trip. Be a good girl, Hinata. I'm taking you to daycare. Wanna go with Papa! I'm hurt! Don't say that. Yeah, I wanna go with Mama. Let's eat. Here you are. Great! What shall we eat first? Looks delicious. Thank you. Start with the pancake? Looks yummy! See you. See you. See you! Hey, Hiyori. Would it bother you if I became prime minister again?
