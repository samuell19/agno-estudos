SHOOT! For the kids joy, in the circus ring... ...the tiniest army in the world. Turn around! I said turn around! OK.. OK. Go for it. Flip the gun. OK... here. What's happening? Shall we go? Wait a second. I couldn't even stand the circus when I was a kid. Makes me sad. Danilo, what are you doing? Admiral, do something! No Danilo, you can't do that! Get out! Get out of here! Everyone out! And now the most important part of the show... I've had enough. See you at the paper tomorrow. OK, bye. The Wonderland Circus presents, the queen of the amazons... ...the extraordinary, fantastic... ...Giuditta! Another hand for our extraordinary Giuditta! And now, friends, something never seen... ...to date in a circus ring. Giuditta will hit... ...and burst the balloons with her rifle... ...at full gallop. Go for it, Giuditta, we're all behind you! Kids, pick the color of the balloon Giuditta will burst. C'mon, a color! Red! Red! Red! Another color, c'mon! Green! Green! Green! The yellow, Giuditta, the yellow. Blue! Blue! Blue! Another balloon, you hear? The blue! It will only take a second. I don't want to talk to you. Please, Anna. I'm tired. What do you want? I'm Marcos Valles, journalist at "El Pais". This is Fernando. And so? I'm reporting on the circus for the weekend insert. I'd like to ask you a few questions, take some shots, if that's OK. What do you pay? Sorry? What do you pay? It's just few questions on your work, I don't... How much will you pay me? We'll make an agreement... Giuditta, are you German? I'm Italian. My name is Anna. Giuditta's my stage name. Are you going to publish my photo? Of course. I'll become famous. Why not? I never read the paper. I like TV. Anna, when are you going to teach me to shoot? When you grow up. You have to be strong to handle a rifle. I do gym every day, Mom gave me permission. She said I'm old enough. When you're a little older... ...we'll do a number together, OK? Ok. "Giuditta and Karen". No wait... "Karen and Giuditta"! Alright! Anna, when can we talk? Half and hour would do. I don't know... - Anna, ready for the bows. - Coming! How about tomorrow? Maybe... ...maybe... What time? She's beating around the bush. I like her. In the neighborhoods where homelessness, sadness, and desperation rule... ...there's a magic place, a forgotten world inhabited by strange people... ...who dedicate their life to a disappearing art... ...the circus. Fine. And it's possible to encounter a woman of fragile beauty, unexpected... ...who can shoot like Buffalo Bill. No, cut "Buffalo Bill". Marcos? I know you're there. It's Laura, pick up! I know you're listening... You there? I already said no. Why are you doing this? What have I done? Too difficult to explain. You're a son of a bitch! It's the guy from yesterday. Hello. Good morning. Did you come to interview her or to see her? Karen, please. Well... for both things. Can we talk? It's for the article. I don't have much to say. What's your name? Anna Meltzer. Passport number 841... ...8492. Where are you from? Bolzano, Italy. Have you done this work for a long time? Fifteen years. Are your parents with the circus? Listen... my father is a driver for Ferrari. A driver. My mother is a Russian ballerina. From Minsk, Bielorussia. My mother is an extraordinary dancer. Svetlana Pavlova, you know her? Pavlova. The great Pavlova. Svetlana Pavlova. Svetlana. She's the daughter of the Czar of Russia's... ...cousin. She's very famous. The world idolizes her. Strange you don't know her. I've never been interested in dancing. I've always had a mad passion... ...for horses and guns. My Cossack blood, no doubt. No doubt. I was an extraordinary child. If they gave me a "bambola"... - A doll. - A doll. I would cry desperately... ...but so desperately... Why? Why? Because I wanted a gun, a rifle, a shotgun... ...and a horse. I see. Why don't we just drop it? Ok. My parents were trapeze artists. They wanted me to do the same. But I have vertigo. My first boyfriend taught me how to shoot. I was 13, he was almost 30. We worked together six months. And then you got bored with him. He was an imbecile. But don't write that. - Do you like your work? - Yes. I'm very good. I could be in a bigger circus, or in Las Vegas... ...but I like this small circus... ...it's like family. Have you ever shot? When I was young I shot a BB gun. No military service? Never been hunting? I'm the interviewer, but I'll answer you. I'm against hunting... ...and I hate fire-arms. Here! Careful, it's loaded. What do I do now? Aim and pull the trigger. - Trigger... - Yes... And shoot. Good. That's simple. What if I kill someone? Who? OK, wait, let's see... Legs, one in front and one behind. And flex, correct? Yes, if you want to... Let's see... - You have it? - Yes... Shoot! Wow! Again. - I almost did it, huh? - Yes. Now. ...take a deep breath... ...aiming at the second one. Hold your breath... ...and shoot. Again. I'll load now. - Fine. - I like this. Again. - Why? - No, I 'm not made for this, you go. - No more? - No, I want to see you shoot. Want to make a bet? Make a bet? Well, if you hit all the cans... ...you'll give me a kiss. - That's not fair. - Why? Nothing personal. It's got to be money. A large bill. You have it? All I have is this. A true reporter! Take it or leave it! Shit... It's confirmed, Marcos. You're off to Barcelona tomorrow to cover the concert. That's annoying. Can't anyone else go? It was settled you'd go. Can't Carlos go? You can't back out now. Have fun in Barcelona. What's up? You done? Fuck no, everyone keeps bothering me. OK. I'm going. Those from the circus? - Anna! - Who's there? How are you reporter? Come in. If I'm disturbing... Come in and shut the door, it's cold. Want a drink? Well, yes... yes. A beer. - Help yourself. - OK. Thanks. You haven't finished your article? More or less. I came to show you the photos. I'll be right there. So you live here. It's my home, what do you think? If this is where you live... I like it. Look. This one's nice. No! Careful, it's oily, they'll get dirty. Look. I love this one. And this one. Your particular way of saying "goodnight". Of course. Look, look... This one with the little girl is beautiful. They're all of me. What about the others? I just brought yours. Can I keep one? They're all for you. No. I just want one. But which one? Let me see... This one... This one. This one? These are for you. A gift. Will you sign one? Of course. Got a pen? Can I write in Italian? In whatever language you feel. Can I turn the TV off? Yes, yes. Shoot... ...and get it out of your system. What now? What do you mean? With your paper, what will they do with the photos? The article and the photos will appear in the supplement. Everyone reads it, it's great promotion. We're leaving Friday. You're leaving? Where to? France, then Germany. When are you returning to Madrid? I don't know... In a year. Maybe less, I don't know. Fine... Well... ...I'm leaving. Have you eaten? Let me invite you out. Let me invite you. It's a special night because... ...Mary and Bruno got engaged and we're celebrating. Pedro, this is Marcos... ...Sheila... Rashi, this is Marcos. Thank you. - A little wine? - Thanks. - And you? - Yes, thanks. Do the circus people marry among themselves? Yes, if you want to keep working in the circus. That's how it is. It's difficult to find someone to share your life. We're gypsies. With no home, always here and there. If you live with someone not from the circus... ...either you leave the circus or they leave you. See that fat bald man? Yes. He fell in love with Ursula, the girl next to him. He left everything... ...and came to live with her. He had a delicatessen in Stoccarda. "Stoccarda"? Stuttgart. Well, he left everything, and there you have him. And you? You look handsomer without glasses. I don't know how to do anything else. Sometimes I dream of having a millionaire lover... ...a romantic villa, with two floors... ...a terrace that stretches as far as a lake... ...and in the lake is my boat, my private boat. Lots of... swans in the water. - Swans. - Swans. A garden with wonderful flowers... ...and at least 10 kids. Only? Silence! Silence, please! Sara wants to say a few words. Dear friends! Tony, light! Dear friends, though the circus has known better times... ...we're here to prove the circus will never die. If it does, that the fuck will we live from? Tony, light on the fiancees... ...our friends, Bruno and Marry... ...have decided to join their lives! For this... ...the great circus family wants to wish them happiness... ...and to their children... ...their children's children, and children's children's children! Anyway... ...that they may all work in the circus! For them, for the circus! Kiss, kiss, kiss! You have to take a deep breath. To your happiness. To Mary and Bruno. To Them. Your new companion? He's a friend. A reporter. A reporter? Happiness to you too, reporter. Be careful. She's a very dangerous woman. If you misbehave... Let's dance! Dance with me! Yes. Yes. Yes. No, I can't dance. I know nothing about you. More than I know of you. You interviewed me, didn't you? I know you had your first boyfriend at 13. No, I exaggerated. I was 16... ...and a little stupid when I was with that jerk. - And then? - Then what? How many men have you known? - Already jealous? - No. No? And you? Me? How many men have I known? How old were you when you had your first woman? - Wasn't a lot of fun. - No? Almost didn't notice. I don't know, I was 18 or 19. Truth is... ...I was a late bloomer. However, later... I made up for lost time! We're leaving Friday. I'll follow you. What if I go to Russia? I'll cry. No, I'll follow you to hell. When are you coming back? Tomorrow morning. Call me? Take care. I'll call from Barcelona. I was strolling in the park... ...and I saw a white horse shiny, beautiful... Are you listening? And suddenly... ...he sprung wings. I was impressed. A horse with wings! A little strange, no? I went close to the horse. Then... ...I went close to the horse and he said. "Climb up... ...we'll fly." So I climbed up. And when we were flying... Should I stop? Then from the sky... ...I saw a field. Should I stop? Yeah, yeah, stop. Telephone! It's me, Marcos. How are you? Fine. Slept 'till noon, and you? Little tired, but fine. Can't stop thinking about you. We're done, chief. Where are you, what's that noise? I'm in a concert hall. Would you like to see the show tonight? Alright. Three? When are you coming back? Don't know. The concert finishes late. If I'm not dead tired, I'll be back in the morning. Thank you. Welcome. I love you. Goodbye. A kiss. New guy? Naked! Naked! Naked! Try to get this! She's crazy, why does she do it? What you've done is unprofessional! It's rash. I know. You're right. Those three assholes bothered me throughout my act... It won't happen again. - Want some? - No, thanks. Wait, wait don't go away. This is Paco... ...Mario, and I'm Juan. You were out of sight. You're an impressive chick. We like you a lot. No shit! You're a great shot. Come on and have a drink. - I can't. - C'mon! C'mon, come with us. I'm sure you won't regret it. I'm tired, some other time. Fuck, let loose. Let me through. Don't touch me! Leave me alone! Chill out. Fuck, we just want to be friendly. What do you want? Go home. C'mon Mario. He's a crazy asshole. Let go of me. Miss Mariana, please. I met her in the convent. I'm sorry... ...we had a tragedy at home. Miss Mariana is... She can't see you. I know madam. That's why I wanted to see her... Anyway... Please convey to her... ...my good wishes. I won't be seeing her. I'm returning to Buenos Aires. What name? Raoul, Raoul. Nothing bad will happen while you're at my side. You won't allow anything to happen, right Johnny? Who is it? It's me. Marcos... wait a moment. I'll be right there. Shut up! Put the volume up! Stay still! You're gonna suffocate her! Quiet! Stop shouting! I'll bust your face! Shut up! Stop... ...please stop... Quiet! Turn her around. C'mon. Your turn. Come on! C'mon, what're you waiting for? C'mon! Have some fun! What are you doing? Hold her down. Nobody fucks with me. Let alone you, you whore. Get it, Giudatta? I didn't want to! I didn't... Where are you? Good morning. It's me, Marcos. What the fuck is this? Good morning. Coffee with milk, please. Fine. And a cognac. Right away. You can't believe the house Puri bought. It's fabulous. Gorgeous. Everything's marble. Dear me... Dear nothing. It's great, and I'm still poor. I'm fed up! Pass the cologne. It's very good. Let's see. Lovely. Good smell. I like it. I'm exhausted... all night, all night long. It's disgusting. You've reached Marcos Valles... ...you can leave a message after the beep. Thank you. It was horrible... Horrible... Now for the national news. This morning, 8:30 am, a triple murder was committed. Francisco Arroyo, 19... ...J. De la Encina, 24... ...and M.R. Benegas, 23... ...were shot at close range this morning in the garage... ...''Rodauto'' in Fuenlabrada. Motive of this execution is unknown. It could be a drug related gang shooting. A terrorist act is however not discarded. We are with the garage owner in Fuenlabrada. Any motive for this crime? I don't know. I don't see any. They were three boys... ...hardworking, good... Did you see what happened? I opened the garage, as I do every morning... ...and went up to my office. They arrived on their motorbikes, I told them what to do. One welded... ...the other did motors and... Mario there... I was in the office. He had long messy hair, and a big jacket... ...the rifle was pointed at the floor. I saw Mario fall to the ground the killer walked over him... ...as if nothing... - Sweetheart, wake up... I'm in a hurry. - I thought it was a film... ...or a TV show. I ran down... ...and saw Mario was dead. Then he drove away... ...in a grey Renault I think... Then Juan and Paco... ...all dead... Good morning. - What'll you have? - Coffee and milk. Black for me. My God! It was a bad accident. Were they hospitalized? Yes, in intensive care. ...years, were shot this morning... ...in a garage in Fuenlabrada. Marcos, it's Fernando, call when you can. It was horrible... ...horrible... It was horrible. They were three good kids... You saw what happened? I opened up like always... ...they came on their bikes and began... ...horrible... ...one on engines and Mario there... They started working... I was checking some papers... As I said, I was in my office... ...he had long hair... ...messy, wore a big jacket... ...the rifle was pointed to the floor. I saw Mario fall... ...to the ground, he walked over him. Excuse me... ...are you the garage owner? More press. Enough already. I can't stand it, I've told them everything. Wait... I don't want to bother you. Just one thing... Is it her? A woman... Can't be. A woman wouldn't do such a thing. The hair was long and messy... ...boys wear their hair like that. Wore a big jacket... The rifle pointed to the floor... Got a second? Leave it... What's up? You covering the killing? Those 3 guys... - From the garage? - Yes. Fuck, yes. Before breakfast I had to stare at three bodies. Some job! Anything new? Not that I know of. One had a file for theft and rape. Not much on the other two. Some drug stuff... Police think it's a hit between dealers... Come with me. You have to help me. I'm not completely sure. It's sort of a hunch. What is it about? Ok. The girl who blew them away... ...could be my girlfriend. Are you in a mess? No, no, not me. Only you can help me. What can I do? You get stuff from the police. I know nothing about that world... I have to find her. No, it's stupid, forget it. I'm making a mistake, makes no sense. I'll call you if I hear something. You're torn and hemorrhaging. You have to go to a hospital. What happened? I was raped. Did you tell the police? Not yet. Do it immediately. You can dress. Thank you. This will calm the pain, but you must go to the hospital... ...you're losing a lot of blood. I can't do more here. Do you have a car? Yes, it's outside. Go to the Ciudad Real hospital. Tell them what happened. No, I can't. Don't be afraid. Ask for Dr. Nunez. Tell him I sent you. Give him this. Go there quickly. What do I owe... Nothing. Thanks. Please... ...don't tell anyone. Sexual assault is a crime, they got to be punished. Yes, I know. I'll think about it, but please don't say anything. Just a moment, please. Is this the police? Good afternoon. Something wrong? No, I was resting. I'm exhausted. Car papers and drivers license. Italian? Tourist? Tourist. What's a pretty girl like you doing alone in this desert? Going to Madrid. It's not the fastest way. You made a mistake. Should've turned at the detour. Oh yes? Thank you. I'll turn and go back... Should I accompany you? Can I go? No, just a moment. What's in your bag? Traveling clothes... my things, nothing. Please step out and open the bag. Step out! Leave her alone, she's just a tourist. Get out! Come on. Get the bag. Rain is strong enough to penetrate the sand. A meter approximately... ...and wakes an animal that is suprising to find... ...in a desert. A frog. There are numerous frogs... ...who suprisingly survive in droughts. They hide beneath the earth for years... ...wrapped in a second skin... ...to keep their bodies humid. This provides the first meal when waters touch and ends a sleep... ...which could have lasted 5 years. Then follows a brief, but glorious freedom... ...during which they eat and reproduce... ...until dreyness sends the frogs back into their time capsule. Hi Manuel. What? Where did it happen? I'm going. Pick you up in ten minutes. Bye. What's your name? Alberto. Your nose is bleeding. And a scratch on your face. Where do you live? Over in that house. Doesn't start. What's your name? My name? Anna. Where d'you live? Don't know. How can you not know? No... Here and there. Mom... There's a lady. A lady... Let her in. Come in, come in. Good evening. What do you want? My God, what's wrong? You're hurt. It's nothing. I had a car accident, and... A drink? Like to rest? - Some water. - Son, get some water, quick. Come in, come in. Are you feeling ill? - It's nothing. - Come along. Lie down a little. Are you a hunter? Yes. Drink this. Thank you. Lie down now. Her name is Anna. I won't use the information I have on her. Don't even insinuate it, you know me better. In something of this sort... ...I don't even know my parents. Well, I'm different. Are you sure? If you're involved... ...why take her diary? This diary is worth a fortune. Don't know. Why d'you say that? People are morbid, they love a tragedy... ...as long as they're not involved. Isn't that sad? It's disgusting. Actually... ...it scares me. Because it affects... ...you directly. It's Santana... ...anything new on the girl? Fine. What? What fucking radio? Turn on the radio, someone's saying something. Call if anything comes up. When I checked her she was ill. Had a lacerated uterus, loss of blood. Clearly she was raped, brutally raped. I advised her to go to the hospital... ...to report it, so they would be punished... ...she paid no attention. - The girl's ill. - Fucking bad luck! With no treatment, she'll die. We can drop the whole thing! Our friendship's more important. Come on, Marcos. She's not well, Juan. I think she hit her head... You never know. Take her to the village doctor. Otherwise, I'll keep worrying. I'd like to know who she is... ...a woman doesn't walk around with this sort of rifle. It's very fishy. Feeling better? Need something? No, thank you. Why the rifle? - Want a doctor? - It's nothing. You should see a doctor. I said it's nothing! Sorry... ...forgive me. Once again violence has brought mourning... ...to the police force. A terrorist act has broken 2 lives. At 3 in the afternoon... ...at the 23rd km of the Comarcal Highway... ...police officers Francisco Munoz... ...and Felipe Hermoso were shot. The first was mortally wounded. The second is fighting for his life. The wounded policeman reported it was a young woman... ...a foreigner, with a semi-automatic rifle... ...who is prime suspect... ...in the killing of 3 young men... ...in a garage in Madrid, for unknown causes... Please help me. They found you. What d'you want? There's nothing valuable. Good lord... ...she's bleeding. Coming? They found her. Attention! Attention! You're surrounded! You have no escape! Give yourself up immediately! What are you doing? She's crazy! Why us? Shut up! No, Juan... ...don't do it! Don't shoot! Don't shoot. Out! Get out! Do what she says... ...it's better. How can I leave you? Out! Go, tell them we're OK. They should leave. Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Don't shoot, it's me! Don't shoot! We're reporting live... Don't shoot! ...where Anna Meltzer, the young Italian woman is hiding. She is suspected of 4 deaths and is holding a family hostage... The house is surrounded, we're waiting to an end to this story... - What happened? - Husband came out. - Who's inside? - The girl, the wife, 2 kids. They're hopefully alive. She's crazy. Can't work like this. Let's see if I know someone. Hello, Sergeant. My friend here... Can't come through. Listen... listen... I know this woman. I could talk to her. - Know her? - Yes. Come with me. Wait here. Excuse me, Captain. Someone knows the Italian. This guy? Yes. Evening. Can I help you? I know this woman. You know her? I went out with her. You're this bitch's friend? Listen... ...it would be sensible to speak to her. I'll do it, I know her. I could convince her. Let me speak to her. Do your job reporting and let us do our job. Thanks. The house is surrounded! Free the hostages and give yourself up! Come out with your hands up! You have no way out! Give yourself up! It's your last warning, you're surrounded! Come out or we'll come in. You have 15 seconds. What will you do? Don't know... I just want to be left in peace. And us? Why not let Alberto go? I'll stay with you. I can't. Let him go... I want to stay with her. You keep quiet. Aren't you sleepy? No. Mom says I sleep little. Do you ride horseback? Yes, but I'm afraid. I have 2 horses. One's called Laura, the other Claudio. What do you want to be in life? Football player, to play like Stoicof... ...like Stoicof. Who's that? You never saw him? How can you not know him? He's a forward for Barcelona. I'm on the school team. I play defense, but I prefer forward. Enough! Enough! Enough, please, enough. I can't bear this waiting. With your help, I could get to the house. I could go in. Try to do something. There's not much you can do. We can just wait. They won't do anything 'till morning. There's a woman and 2 kids in there. It's all over the news. The girl should give herself up. I read her diary and... She doesn't write anything... She's sensitive... You're taken by her. What happened was wonderful. You're putting her on a pedestal. This fucking girl killed 4 people and wounded one. Where's the Italian's friend? Come with me. You know her and don't mention it? What an asshole! Mute as a mummy! You're the asshole! This is personal, and I have no explanations to give. - Know, what? - No, what? - You're unprofessional. - You're professional? Vulture! Ball buster! It's me, Marcos! I'm coming in. I have to talk to you! I'm coming in! I need to talk to you! Hi, reporter. I told you I'd follow you to hell. Here I am. How are you holding up? Well... I'm well. I needed to see you. We haven't finished our interview. Let them go. I'll stay with you. Get out. We can go? Yes, get out of here. Alberto, son, wake up, we're going. Come on, son. I can't stand it. I'm tired. Wait. Don't say that. I want to die! No, you don't, I'm here now, calm down. I want to die. Wait, wait, wait. - I want to die. - No, we'll make it... ...you and I! We'll make it! I'll take care of everything. Just think about getting better. Can you get up? I'm sleepy. Listen, listen... Listen to me... ...we'll go outside. You'll get treatment. We'll get a lawyer. No! We'll get the best lawyer. You have mitigating circumstances. We'll mobilize the press. They can't give you many years. They can't! And I'll wait for you. I'll always be with you.
