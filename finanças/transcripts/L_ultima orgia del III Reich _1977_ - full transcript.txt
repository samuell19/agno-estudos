Murderer! You've killed your own daughter! Silence. Silence! My name is Gerda Braun. I'm 36 years old and I live in Cologne. Mrs. Braun, the court understands... the pain it must cause you to speak of your experiences... in the Nazi concentration camp at Neugen. Ask your questions. That is why I am here. On July 26th, 1943, you were taken to that concentration camp along with your sister Marian. Tell us what happened to your sister. Marian was a very beautiful girl. She was 20 years old. The Nazis cut the tendons in her legs. They made her unable to walk. Why did they do that? My sister had tried to avoid the attentions of two camp officers. She ran away. That's how those two officers got the idea. Unable to walk, Marian could only crawl at their feet. They had turned her into a beautiful object to pick up from the floor, lay on a bed and put it to use. Then they would throw her back down on the floor. My name is Helmut Lang. I'm 53 years old and I live in Berlin. Mr. Lang, you were a sergeant who worked in the archive department of the camp. - Is that correct? - Yes, sir. How many women were taken to that camp? The number is 4786, Your Honour. Are you able to tell us how many of them were executed? 3972. Not counting the 228 who died of natural causes. Mr. Lang, who decided the fate of the prisoners? All the elimination papers were signed by Commander Conrad von Dosslen. Objection! My client was only tasked with signing the death certificates! - The elimination papers came from Berlin. - Liar! Shame on you! Objection sustained. Use... Use... How did you manage to find me? I've looked for you. I'm glad you did. I didn't know what happened to you. It's been five years, I'm sure you must have created a new life for yourself. Where do you live? What have you been doing? Don't ask me anything. I've been looking for you. - What about you? - I've spent some time in prison. Then, after the trial, I've been trying to fit into the new Germany. It hasn't been easy. Thank you. Thank you. Your testimony stopped those bastards from sentencing me. You had a good lawyer. You must have paid him well, with all the passion he put into it. My country should have paid his fees. I was just a soldier. I only followed orders, I was doing my duty. It's really you... It's you... Your breath, your voice, your perfume... Your body... We're â€œhaw back together, Use... Why did you want to meet me here? To remember. Pig! Filthy pig! You just spread your legs! You don't feel a thing! You're nothing more than an animal! If only you enjoyed it, you could have anything you wanted from me. Out of the truck! Move it! No, no... No, don't take her away! No! Not my child! No! Don't take him away! No! Not my child! No! My child! Mercy! You can go. These Jewish girls are usually healthy. Most of them, at least. Well, I'm not surprised. The Jews have been eating too well for a long time. As well as affording the best doctors available. All with the money they've Stolen from our country. That's right. These girls are here from Munich. Some of them are Austrian. All part of wealthy families. Some married to bloodsucking usurers. A bunch of powdered, perfumed whores. Half the world is fighting us because we are trying to get rid of these people. - But one day they will thank us. - They will, indeed. You can go. I don't need to examine you. No. She must be examined like the other girls. - But this girl is a virgin. - Examined like the others, Doctor. Don't be scared. I'm not going to hurt you. This you see here is my battleground, Rudolf. How different it is compared to the glory dreams we had at the military academy. Stand up if you don't want those legs broken! You wanted to follow your father's heroic exploits. You said that all the time. - Too many dead German heroes nowadays. - Heil! What we really need now are soldiers who can manage to stay alive. Soldiers willing to follow orders without discussion, just like you. - Without discussion, indeed. - Heh. Not even when they ordered me to run this brothel-like camp. A love camp, as our enemies sneeringly call it. We're here only to keep this women ready to pleasure the soldiers who return on leave. The war is long. We have the whole world to conquer. You're right, and nobody will ever stop us. Heil! You know, Rudolf... When you were in Paris, marching down the Champs Elysees... Well, I wish I'd been there too. You'll be there when we'll march on New York. But right now you're needed here. There's many different ways to make our country proud, Conrad. - I'll see you soon. He". - Heil. Drive. - Heil Hitler! - Heil Hitler! - Heil Hitler! - Heil. Soldiers. Heroes returning from the front and who are already longing to return to combat. Our fuhrer has decided to reward your bravery... by assigning you to this camp on special leave. We'll do our best to make your stay as pleasant as we can. And to help your steel bodies regain all their strength before resuming the fight. We want you to keep on destroying the weak to create... a new world, led only by those who are strong. Lights. Look. This girl did not eat for five days. She stole scraps from a dog's bowl. That revealed her beastly instincts. Look. She's so focused on satisfying her hunger... that she's not even aware of being sexually stimulated from behind. It's all down to the law of the beasts, who are not capable of satisfying two physical needs at the same time. Those two women are mother and daughter. That didn't prevent them from having incestuous, unnatural sexual relations. They're utterly incapable of feeling the sacred bond of a family. A normal human being would never behave in such a despicable way. They asked never to be separated, that's why we tied them in that position. We'll keep them that way until death. Very much like dogs, who love sensations that humans would find repellent, this woman loves to smell the excrement of a man. Yet she did even worse. She eats it. She smears her body with it. That's how she finds pleasure. Like with a drug. She's happy. She even masturbates in that state. She reaches her climax. Lights. And now, I have the duty to remind you... that a soldier of the Reich never makes love to Jewish girls. He only takes pleasure from them. And he does so by dominating them. By showing them his superiority. His utter perfection. He should cause her to suffer. Never must a Jewish girl be allowed to enjoy your same sexual pleasure. See those girls over there? They're your enemy. Conquer them. Enjoy yourselves, soldiers. It's imperative to make them suffer. It's an order. Hooray! Hooray! Well done, boys. They're always ready for a good brawl. Always ready to return to the front lines. Move! Move it! Move! Get a move on! Move it! Come on! Move! Mum... Get some rest now, be good. Rest. I want my mum. Try to get some sleep. What's your name? Use. It must have been terrible for her. There's no time for mercy in a place like this. Where did they capture you? Dresden. Last month. Your folks? Forget it. There's no time for mercy in this place, you said so yourself. I'd have rather ended in a different camp. Buchenwald, maybe. There, at least, you can get a relatively quick death. No! No! No, stop. Don't. No, don't hurt me! You bitches! What are they doing to her? Don't get involved. They're doing the decimation. One of the group gets attacked and disfigured by the others, so the Germans will eliminate her. Why do they do it? It increases their chance of survival. Every time other pretty girls arrive, they get rid of some of the old ones. So it's better to help them take that decision. It's horrible. It's just like murder. You must always watch your back, even from your companions. This is Hell, we're surrounded by evil. Feel free to take it out on me next time. Anytime you want. Tell it to the others. Stand up! Here they are, my elite girls. Sorry for making you get up so early, guess you'd have liked to sleep till noon. I'm sure you were used to that. Things have changed now. Are you afraid? I don't like women who are afraid. - I'm going to need you. - No! No! No! No! No, no! No! No! - Who's that woman? - Dagmar. She's one of the commanding officers and works for the Gestapo. Where did they take that poor woman? She was chosen because she's menstruating. Dagmar gave her to her Dobermans. Those dogs go crazy over menstruating girls. They rip them to shreds. Professor, officers, a toast. Cheers! Everything in existence serves a purpose. Nothing was created without a clear reason. There's a motive behind every existence. Everything should be used in the best possible way. It is my opinion that a life should only be extinguished if strictly necessary. And only if it serves a clear goal. What about Jewish life, though? All the same. Killing is condoned only when absolutely necessary. But it is necessary to exterminate the Jews, not gratuitous. Am I right, Professor? The fuhrer proved that many times. - To our fuhrer! - To our fuhrer! Absolutely. Our fuhrer proved it many times, indeed. But that could perhaps change. In the future, at least. There is no future for the Jewish race! Our mighty Germany is the only nation that owns the future. A toast to our mighty Germany! To our mighty Germany! I hope I didn't force that cheer against your will, Captain. Not exactly. I too was drinking to a dream. To Germany becoming great for the right reasons. After all, God created nettles, scutch grass, cockroaches and flies. Alas, God must have created the Jews to fulfill some purpose. Every divine creation has one, after all. Then what would you use a Jew's life for, Professor? I'll tell you. Once Germany will finally achieve global domination, we'll be able to impose our rules for a better world. A world of peace and serenity. A world where the Aryan race will multiply and thrive as fast as it can. - So what? - We're bound to have problems sooner or later, Commander. Take humble jobs, wasting a superior Aryan intellect on those would be nothing short of sacrilegious. Humble jobs merely requiring the strength of human-like beasts. Jobs like ploughing the earth, for example, or unloading a ship. And let's not forget about the problem of nourishment. Even today, in 1943, we're already consuming much more than we produce. Now, try to imagine. Try to imagine Jewish families being confined within large farms. Harvesting and farming less prosperous acres. Ten armed soldiers would be more than enough to staff such model camps. They would be more than enough to guard 500 Jews. Can you even imagine it? Using ten to get the fruit of the work of 500! A fascinating project, I'd say. That's not all. Living in nature would make our Jews grow plump and healthy. It would prepare them to serve another function. Another way that would make them absolutely useful to our race. A toast to our race! Hear, hear! Tell us more, Professor. Once they reach a certain age, our adult, healthy Jews... will be sent to the most advanced butchery institutes we have. There they'll be transformed into edible, juicy... and nutrient steaks. That professor is smart. Now I finally understand your Christian mentality, Professor. But who assures us their meat will be good enough to eat? Oh, I hope all of you will, in a few minutes. After you'll get a taste of this dish. - This is monstrous and inhumane! - Captain Koenig! What we do in this camp is essential to get rid of the enemies of the Reich! And to uphold the honour and fate of our nation. You believe such useless barbaries to be necessary, Commander? What yellow-bellied individuals like you call barbaries are proper army experiments. Which will prepare our soldiers to relieve their comrades in the front lines. We have the duty to eliminate every enemy of our nation. And that includes civilians, children and women. And we'll do it, even if you don't agree, Doctor. I'm only trying to do my duty. For better or worse. I've always obeyed, even against my own personal opinions. Your duty now would be to leave this room at once, Doctor. We'd rather do without your company. Gentlemen, let's eat. - Excellent. - Tastes as sweet as pork. An exquisite dish. Tastier than veal. Didn't I tell you? Jews are actually good. Meat on meat. Meat on meat, indeed. Right on! Not too lean, yet not too fat. Yes, she's a fine specimen. - Top notch meat. - Exquisite. She looks so tender. Just like suckling lamb. She reminds me of Crepes Suzette. Yes... With plenty of Cognac. - Lots of Cognac... - In generous amounts... Love... My love... Love, my love... Love... My love... You filthy little beast. Come here. You repulsive beast... You didn't cry. You didn't despair. You didn't suffer at all. Who are you? Amazing. You know no fear. But you know I could have killed you just like that. It would have been better. Dying would be a liberation. A liberation, right. Just another way to get out of the camp, huh? Just another way to end it all. Damn you. You really ached to provoke me, didn't you, bitch? Put your mind at ease, though. There's no escape from this camp, not even in death. People here do what I want them to do. And that includes dying when I want them to. Never when they wish to. You wanted to use me as a ticket for a quick death. To finally escape. You will never make me. What fun would it be killing someone with no will to live? But trust me, I'm going to get that desire back in you. By making you suffer. That bite you gave me was nothing... compared to what I'll make you endure. I'm going to humiliate you. I'm going to destroy your body and your mind. And only when you'll fear death again... When you'll wish to live, only then... Only then I will allow you to die. You will regret defying me. Use... Use. Hans! Albert! Bring her in here! Liselotte Cohen... Come here, Liselotte Cohen. You're pretty. Beautiful, even. Beautiful as a beast. Like my Dobermans. Tame, just like them. When they're not hungry anymore. Look. 80 straight and silky. Feel them. These panties are made with the most precious fabric in the whole world. It wasn't easy to gather so many identical hair. We've been forced to sacrifice so many girls like you. Fine hair, yet stronger than silk threads. Keep them, I can have as many as I want. This is the first present we've given you, don't forget. What do you want from me? You will know in due time. Let's talk about beauty. I really admire it. That's why I like to preserve it. Come here. Come here. See these gloves? Feel them. They're made out of babies' skin. There's nothing softer than the skin of a newborn baby. Too bad babies grow up and their skin gets old and ugly. It's best to take it off right away, I say. It's monstrous. For you, but not for us. Drink this. Drink it! For us it's joy, and also a sense of greatness. It's happiness. It's vengeance and enjoyment. Enjoyment of being able to do whatever we like to anyone. Like what I'm doing to you now. I enjoy seeing you more relaxed and obedient. Even your hatred is fading. Drink it. Drink it. Drink it... Love and death. A poet's dream. Look. Look at it. This tattoo was too beautiful to let it rot with his owner. Look at it, I said! We took it from him. But first we made him happy. We wanted him to have one last nice memory. Scream! You'll feel like you're burning alive! Weep in despair! Weep! Stop my hand from skinning you alive! Cry. Weep in despair. You'll see your blood and you'll feel immense pain. Scream and weep for the beauty we're taking from you! You're about to be turned into a thing! A filthy little thing! Hans! Albert! Take her away, the game is over! We'll teach you how to suffer like the others! Because we are the strongest! We'll destroy, smash, annihilate you! And then we'll keep you after turning you into gloves, lampshades and panties! That's how we'll remember and mock your beauty! How we'll laugh! But first we want to see your tears and your pleas! We want to hear you begging for the agony to end! Love and death... Love and death. Come here. Come on, join me. Come here, my love. Soiled yourself again, I see. You're just a dirty little pig. A repulsive pig that needs to be punished! Your mummy will show you the right punishment for soiling your pants! Shame on you, Conrad. I'll show you what happens when you disobey me. You like being punished, don't you? My beloved pervert. I am your mistress. Your mummy! Your queen. I'm the only one who knows how to make you happy, Conrad. I'm going to help you break that prisoner's will. I will always give you the sweet pain you crave. Only I know what turns you on. Only I know your vices! Only me, Conrad. Only me! Sorry for keeping you waiting. I hope you've been able to get some rest these past two days. Be brave, my darling. You're about to start suffering for real. You'll start crumbling slowly. And you'll grow old very quickly and unnaturally. Remember that physical pain is enough to kill a person. And it's a horrible way to die! You feel like you can't breathe. You feel like there's a pain in your chest. More and more unbearable. You feel like your heart is about to burst. There's pain in every inch of your body. Your vision becomes cloudy. The eyes are the first to die. Then the hands. And finally your whole body! Whole! Whole! And you can feel it happening. Scream. Scream! Scream! Scream! I want to listen to your screams! You. - Ride her. - Heil Hitler! You must try to save yourself. You just have to show the commander that you're afraid of him and of death. It wouldn't change anything. He'll kill me anyway whenever he wishes to. Maybe he'll spare your life if you play his game. That murderer is still a man, after all, and he's very interested in you. Try to survive, Lise. I can't believe you're telling me such things. You've never done anything to avoid death. You're right, maybe I've been wrong. But you must try to survive at all cost. Get up! You must come with us! Don't cry. I won't let them hurt you. I spoke to the doctor, he'll let you stay with him for a while. I'm going to lower you. Slowly. Little by little. The rats are waiting for you. Look at them. They're incredibly voracious. My blood is exciting them. If I didn't take my hand out they'd pick it clean. Take a good look at them, Lise. Think about the last time you saw yourself in the mirror. You'll never see your beauty again. You wanted to use me to die, didn't you? I'm going to grant your wish. You'll win, but at a high price. The rats will go for your eyes first. They love eating eyes. But you'll still be alive. And you'll still be alive when they'll devour your nose and your lips. They'll eat all the flesh off your face. You'll go crazy. You'll try biting them. To eat them alive. But a few of them will get to your brain. That'll be the end of you. Still not begging for mercy, I see. Still not imploring me. Still not trembling! Scream! I'm going to break you. Pig! Filthy pig! If only you enjoyed it, you could have anything you wanted from me. Good girl. You've finally changed your mind. Yes, come here... Come on, hurry. Come here. Come on. Oh, yes... You must save Lise. Please, I'll do anything you want. Take her away from Conrad, I implore you. I'll do anything you want. Just save her. Save her. Save her, I beg you. - He's going to kill her. - Oh, yes... - I'll do anything, just say that you like it. - Just talk to him, I beg you. - Say that you love me. - Yes, I love you. Please, I'm imploring you... Save her. Save her, save Lise... Save her. I finally had you the way I wanted to. You filthy, spineless, murdering swine... You rotten son of a bitch! There. You are at death's door. Twenty, thirty or maybe fifty women are below you. You could join them. I'd just have to give the order. It's a quick death. It's a practical, hygienic method. It only takes a matter of minutes to leave a few bones. But your friend will precede you. Her punishment for attempting to bribe Lieutenant Reismann. Now you'll see what a death by quicklime looks like. Down. Down! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! It's not your body I want, but something more. Madness. I want your madness. I want to drive you insane before killing you. Up. Look at her. Take a good look at her. A ghastly sight, isn't it? By God, just scream already! Beg for mercy! I'll hack you into a million pieces! I'll make soap out of your body! Down! You'll either die or go mad, don't you get it? Down! Down! This girl seems to have suffered some mental damage. I believe she's endured too much suffering. Very well, Doctor. This is a one in a million opportunity for you. Until now you've only been able to operate on bodies, but here's a mind at your disposal. Make the most of it. This girl could only be cured in a specialised clinic. This girl will remain here. - Has Lise become insane, Doctor? - No. She's just in shock. Will she ever heal? The love of friends like you can do miracles. We must keep her here as long as possible, Ingrid. Go to bed now. And remember you're here only because they think you're sick. You'll be sent back to the barracks if they find out you're perfectly well. Try to forget, Lise. As a German, I'm ashamed of what they did to you. I'm ashamed that I couldn't stop it. But now I'm here to help you. Yes, I know. But how? You're on a path to self destruction. I'm a murderer. Let them do whatever they want to me. I only wish to die. Life has become too much of a burden. I only wish to die. You? A murderer? What are you talking about? I've killed my father, my mother and my brother. I don't deserve to live anymore. Why did you do it, Lise? I wanted me and my brother to be treated like any other German children. I wanted us to be free to walk in the parks of Dresden, free to listen to music, to say our names out loud, to live. I couldn't stand any longer to hide in an attic with my family. I knew a Gestapo informer. If I told him where my parents were hiding, he assured me he'd have smuggled them to Switzerland. Me and my brother could go home and fear no harm. Four soldiers came instead. My mother screamed. They broke all her teeth. My brother tried to defend her and they shot him down like a dog. He was only 16. Some time later they told me that my parents had died at Auschwitz. I'm a murderer! I want the Gestapo files on the arrest of the Cohen family, Oberstrasse 76, Dresden. Yes, all four arrested on the 18th of March. Send me the files as soon as you can. Personal. Heil! Heil! - No, Lise! Stop! - Let me go! - I wanna die! - You didn't kill your parents! Look! Read this! I've just received this report from Berlin. It's the file about your family, it's the real truth about what happened to them! You must not feel guilty. The Gestapo had known their hiding place for two months! They've been denounced by a man named Johann Smaltz. The priest. Denounced by the priest who swore to help us. It wasn't your fault. You had nothing to do with it. It feels so strange to find out the truth from you. Being cured is not just about having a wound heal. I don't know if I'll make it. Now I'm really afraid of this place. One can only die in this camp. You only need a few grains of earth to make a rose bloom. And you've found them already. The truth. Someone who loves you. Someone willing to help you. No one is ever truly evil. It's the circumstances that turn us evil. Or if we are forced into it. Men like Commander Conrad represent the last hopes of Germany. They are the evil that engulf es everything. Maybe, one day, peace will be built from the ashes of Nazi Germany. And our past atrocities will serve as a warning to preserve it. To live... Now I want to live. Live! Lise. Lise... Lise! Lise? Wait here. It's absurd! I'm sick of guarding a bunch of whores! I've asked to be transferred to the front. I want to make myself useful. The entire world has sided against Germany. What our nation needs right now is men who are willing to fight. Our nation needs soldiers ready to follow orders, most of all. We're not fighting a private war for wannabe heroes. There's no use on the front line for soldiers who cannot follow orders. But we have currently resorted to sending kids to the front lines! That's the point. Kids can follow any order without batting an eye. The only order a soldier should need is to go into battle. The higher-ups in Berlin have appreciated your work here, von Dosslen. We really wouldn't like to have to rethink our judgement. I believe you'll do everything in your power to avoid that. - Heil. - Heil Hitler! Hans! Your judgement... I'm still stuck here! I've become a brothel madam. So be it. Lise. Lise! Lise! I need you. These panties could have been made from your hair. My hair is much too precious. Because it belongs to you. I am important, too, because I'm yours. You're ravishing, Lise. In this place filled with death, you're the only thing that reminds me of life. I thank you. Now I've learned what love really is. And I've learned to live. You've learned how to love life. Because I've taught you about death. Yes, you taught me to know death. Lise! Lise! Lise! They want to take me away! Help! I'm begging you! Lise... Ask the commander to save my life! Lise, I want to live! I'm begging you, Lise! Help me! No... No! No! No! - No! - Peter! - No! - Stop! - Peter, no! - No! - No! - Peter! - No! - Stop! - No! - Peter! Let's go, Lise. There he is. You have won, Conrad. That girl has become your slave. You've been magnificent. There is nothing you wouldn't be able to make her do. The other day she sent her best friend to die. And she didn't hesitate for an instant. You've forced her to love life. She lives with you, you are together. But now it's time to get rid of her, Conrad. You must prove to her who the real master is. The master of life and death. You must show her no mercy, Conrad. Get this story over with. Did I make myself clear? Kill that girl. You're still my little boy. I'll punish you! You're a pervert. My own little pervert. No! No! No! No! No! No! I'm pregnant. It's a boy. No... No! No! No... My baby! No! No, you can't! - Calm down, it is necessary! - You can't! This baby would have had a tragic life, don't you get it? - No! - He's a bastard! The son of a Jew! - No! Not my son! - There's no place for him in the new world! - No! - We must do it for his own good! No! - It's our duty! - Spare him!
