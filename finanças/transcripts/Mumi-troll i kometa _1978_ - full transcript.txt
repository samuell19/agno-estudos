I am, Moomintroll Senior, continuing to write my reminiscences about how I and my family had settled in the Moomin blue valley. In a small house, which had been built by me... myself. Together with me have been dwelling my wife - Moominmamma. Moominmamma this is such kind of mamma, who always permits everyone to do anything and never forbids anybody from anything. Children, we've dined without you. The meal on a cooker. Eat whatever you want. And also here have been dwelling Moomintroll Junior, our sonny, and his friend Sniff, he's like a relative to us. Based on the same named story Tove Marika Jansson. Moomin-troll and the comet. Late in a night, when everybody had already been sleeping, someone's plaintive voice awaked Moominpappa. It's I am... The Muskrat. Excuse me, that I disturb you about trifles. The fact is that because of a flood hm-hm-hm... my house is destroyed. What a pity! Come in, I beg you magnanimously! This is an unnatural rain. There's something in the air. It's some indications. It looks that a comet is flying towards us. Look... It's really like a star with a tail. Like a comet. Like having a tail comet, which is going in a black emptiness of the outer space. And the comet... is it tasty? Do not bother me, I am pondering. I am pondering that all in the world are ephemeral. And what is it - ephemeral? Ephemeral means flimsy. All in this world are flimsy and ephemeral... Aha... Your hammock is ephemeral at that. And when will the comet fly against the earth? I have no idea. Ask at professors in an observatory in the Lonely Mountains. Mom! We together with Sniff are setting off for the Lonely Mountains, to the observatory, we'll sail in the raft. All right, sonny. Do will not forget, that Moominmamma this is such kind of mamma, who always permits everyone to do anything. Ah, how I wish I could set off together with them. And Moominpappa has remembred those daring jorneys, which he had been making in the days of his youth. And the comet... is it scary? And it is larger than what thing? It is larger than nothing. Who is that? What is that? Why! This is Snufkin! With his own harmonica! And we are setting off for the Lonely Mountains, to the observatory! The comet is flying towards the earth! But it's less than a fly! But it's flying towards us! And we want to look at stars in a great telescope! It's need to say, that such a lonely wanderer, as whom Snufkin had been and whom he have remained, was possible to lure only with a long journey. And Snufkin become agitated. I also, I also like stars! Before slumber I always look at them! Then leap! The tent! The tent have been left! Why it's dark?! I'm frightened! The music flew up the mountains, awoke echo by echo and awoke... one Hemulen. Noise? Noise. Noise, noise, noise, hush, hush... someone is noising here! Maybe it's insects, rare, haven't yet been discovered by anybody! Thank you, Hemulen. You've saved us. I wasn't saving you at all, I had been catching some cave buzzer for my collection. Is this the Lonely Mountains? Is this The Lonely Mountains? I haven't been catching mountains, I'm not interested in mountains. What have we gone off for? For the comet. The comet?! Oh, oh, oh, oh, hush, hush! Does it fly? Of course. Oh! Oh! Is it a great rarity? It comes once in a hundred years! Oh! Oh, oh, oh, hush! Hush! Hush! And how does it look? Bright red and with a tail. Oh! Oh! Oh! And what do they eat? They eat Hemulens. And there's no any comet. The Muskrat have made all up. As you wish, I'm going home. But we've agreed to stroll up to the observatory. Let's go home and then we'll stroll up. As you wish but I'm untying. But you wanted yourself to look at stars at last. So, look - so over there a star. It isn't pleased to look at her at all. On the very summit of rocky Mountain stood the observatory, professors was living along with stars here, and making thousands amazing discoveries. The huge telescope was moving slowly hither and thither looking out for dangers in the outer space. How do you do. How are you? May I look into telescope? We won't sploil. Professor wasn't answering. He have spent as it is 93 years of his own life on trifles. One moment. Let me in. You are not speaking right way. How do you do! I have heard so much about one respected professor, who had discovered the comet, but it seems he is not here? Perhaps it's in an another observatory. No, no, no, by no means, by no means, it is here, it is, it is he, that-that-that is, it is I. That is such a history you know... yes. It's you?! But there's no comet to be seen. May be you it is you, but the comet is not with you? Here is it! Here is it!!! Look! That is such a history... Sniff have frightened at the first minute - the sky was black, and the stars was huge and winking as alive, and somewhere afar twinkle something alike a red mean eye. Is it the comet? But where has it the tail? And why she doesn't fly? The tail where it's required - behind. The comet is rushing along towards the earth with a huge speed, but it seems, it seems, that it's motionless... And when will it have flown to us? Within four days sharp, m-yes, within four days, sharp, yes. And what will then happen? Will happen? I... I havn't been thinking about it. I... I havn't been thinking about what will happen. In any case I'll describe the course of events in detail for the history of science, that is such a history you know... And now don't bother me, I've lose because of you as it is whole 35 seconds, you know... Author of the script: A. Altaev Director: N. Shorina. Production designer: L. Tanahsenko Camera operator: L.
