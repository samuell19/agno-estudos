(animal vocalises) (birds chirping) (mysterious synth music) (woman vocalising) (mysterious synth music) - I now know I should've listened to my mother. And I should have followed her ways. Stayed in our nice, harmonious little town in Sombrero Land and become a straight, untroubled, and well respected, Valium bound husband killer alcoholic. And then cook my head like a turkey in a gas oven on a beautiful Thanksgiving day. Just like she did. But now it's too late. And anyway, things don't come that easy anymore. It all started four years ago with a heist. And a kiss. (upbeat mariachi music) (laughing) - I love you, man. No, I really love you. - Oh no way, man. I love you. - [Chip] You're beautiful man. You're really beautiful. - We pull it off, you and me. We cleaned that bank out. We pulled off the big, fat one!

Be a good girl and wait for me. (tense synth music) - I'll be waiting. - Forget unleaded, forget super unleaded. Out here in the middle of nowhere, you can find the cleanest, purest, holiest gas in this world or the next. - [Nun] Now sisters, settle down. Watch it. (camera clicking) Sisters, please. - [Woman] Stop Stan, let's go. - One more. Hey, come on girls, get a bit closer there. One, two, (woman gasps) three. (soft, mysterious music) (gasps) - Rita? (soft, mysterious music) (gasps) "Dear Candy, "After four long years of sun, dust, and pain, "I'm coming out. "Just four more days." - [Johnny] We can't take any risks and we don't need any last minute surprises so don't come and meet me. Just go to Porky's and wait for me. Keep cool and wait.

I don't think he's quite ready yet for the outside world. We need to help him. He needs to uh, stay here with us until he can be fully rehabilitated. Perhaps if you could lend a helping hand, so to speak, I might be able to put in a good word for you with the parole board. - Yeah, you know me, Chief. Always willing to help my fellow inmates. - That's my boy. - [Ralph] Hey Chief, look at this. - Jesus. - Nicely crafted, centre parted, with a well proportioned, balanced volume of hair each side, reflects great inner beauty.

He's only trying to get at ya! - Go on, do your worst. Fuck your parole. You'll make my day. - Oh, that's the game. The Chief's making you dance, isn't he? Isn't he? - Yeah. And I'm gonna dance 'til I get out. And when I get out, I'm gonna stick my love bum right up your fuckin' bitch. Give her all the fuckin' babies she wants.

I know you aint had it for a while, being in a nunnery and everything, but, calm down. You could suck the hubcaps off a car with that mouth. - Please, please. Help me. I've become a monster. - Become a monster? You've been the biggest lying, dishonest, devious bitch this planet's seen since the day your head saw light. - Please, please help me. My dogs, the poodles, they changed. I, I-- - I, I, I, I. ♪ Ay ay ya ya ya, ya ya ya ♪ ♪ Ya ya ya ya ya ♪ ♪ Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ♪ Ah! Ya ya ya ya ya! The happy couple.

Look, this is what we're gonna do. You take a frying pan and you put in some extra virgin olive oil, crush a clove of garlic and chop up an onion. Put it on a low heat and let it sweat for about five minutes. Meanwhile, chop up some big, fat juicy tomatoes. Well, under the circumstances, canned will do. And then, pull back-- Oh.

I don't know if I should tell you this, but you see, you're um, changing. You never used to be such a messy eater. I mean, this blood simply refuses to come out. I have tried absolutely everything. I tried bleach, I tried powders, I scrub with this and I scrub with that, but still, it refuses to come out. And the ironing. What can I tell you about the ironing? (plate shatters) - Come on. Come to mommy. Don't be shy.

Fold out the corners, so it's completely flat on the table. Then take the left hand corner, and put it to the middle. Not exact in the middle, but cornered. And now, the real exciting part is to bring up the bottom corner... - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - [Host] To make the shape of a diaper. - [Portia] All right, okay. - Easy. - [Tongue] Well, I guess it's not that easy. (laughing) Actually, I better perfect my technique or he's gonna be flopping around diaper-less. (laughing) His little shiny, red butt exposed to the world. He's gonna be just like his daddy. (rock music) - I hate fuchsia. (gun shot) (yells) (grunts) (gasping) Oh. (heavy breathing) (upbeat electronic music) Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god! (upbeat electronic music) (yelling) Oh my god! (grunts) Fuck it! (gunshot) All right, where are my men? (gunshot) I want my men! (gunshots) (tense, dramatic music) - Come back! - Where are they? - No! No! (gunshot) (Rudolph gasps) - What have you done with my boys, huh? Come on, bitch, hit me with your best shot. (hits) (grunts) (tense, dramatic music) - Oh, god! Holy shit. (hits) (Candy groans) (Candy whimpering) Oh, baby, oh baby, baby. What the hell is that shit? - Johnny. - Baby look, I-- - Hey big fella. Give me a hand. Hey! Hey! You gotta kill her. You gotta kill that bitch! - Babe, babe. I still love you. I still love you, babe. - Snap out of it! (tense, dramatic music) (grunting) - What the fuck's wrong with her? - Let's get 'em. - Got any bright ideas where the fuck we're gonna be going? - The convent, Johnny. - Stop the car, Johnny and let's fuck with that monster. - What? What the fuck are talking about, man? You're fucking talking about my girl, goddammit. - Lousy son of a bitch! - [Rita] Oh no. They're here. - Fucking great, just fucking great. - Stop the car! - Shut up! - Stop the car! - Shut the fuck up! (gasps) - [Tongue] Go, go! - Let's face 'em like men! - Shut up! - [Tongue] Go, go, go! (tongue yelling) - Son of a bitch has run off the road. Let's get 'em. Come on, pull over. - Are you out of your fucking mind? - Pull over. - [Rita] Stop here, stop here, it's my house. - Not a fucking chance. - Oh yeah? (yelling) (crashing) - Jesus Christ, haven't you gotten rid of that shit yet? (gunshots) - Come on down, motherfucker! (gunshots) - [Johnny] Chief, Chief! - What? - That's the wrong goddamn car. (coughing) - Don't shoot, Chief! Don't shoot! It's me. It's Wig, remember? - What the hell is he doing with my Jeep? - Don't shoot, man. - Jeez. - [Chief] Son of a bitch. - [Rita] Everybody into the church. - Yeah, yeah, get me a pine box or a virgin bride and I'll think about it. (laughs) (grunts) (soft, mysterious music) - [All] Rita? - [Wig] Anybody like to tell me what is going on? - Yes, what's going on? - [Rita] They're with me. - Rita, you can speak. - Yes. - It's a miracle. (Chief groaning) A beautiful, beautiful miracle. - Wakey, wakey, girls. This aint Sunday school. Hey look, it's just my baby. My baby, my girl, she's turned into this, oh god, she's got this, this uh-- - Yeah, yeah, yeah, we know Johnny. She's got a tongue like a fucking hose pipe. - Hey. Watch your mouth. - It's Candy. She's a devil. (heavy breathing) - Oh, shit. - I'm out of here. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no. - But Chief-- - No! It's up to Johnny now. What's it gonna be, son? (tense, mysterious music) - Is that a water tank? - [Nun] Yes. We don't have much space. - Will all of you stop all of this shit? (gun cocks) (gunshot) (yelling) - No, my tank! - What are you doing? Let's get the fuck out. - Just stay cool and do as I say. This is the only way out. (gun cocks) I hope. (tense, mysterious music) - Bitch time! - [Poodles] Bitch time! - We're gonna die. That thing's gonna kill us all. - Shh. Shh, it's okay. It's okay. There's nothing left to do but keep the faith and say our prayers. - I guess. You know, Chief, all that stuff back there, well I, I wanna apologise. - You know, I kind of like you with a natural look. (heavy breathing) (tense, dramatic music) (water running) - Oh my god, Chief. - Ah, the happy couple. (pinging) You little two-timing bastard. - Give me strength. (dramatic synth music) (exploding) (exploding) (yells) (exploding) - Oh god. - [Chief] What the hell is going on? Oh god, oh god! Help! Oh! (yelling) (exploding) (whimpering) (grunts) - Oh Jesus. What is that piece of snake shit? - This is my tongue! My tongue is everything you never were. You betrayed me. And for what? A cheap whore and a couple of bucks? (hits) (Johnny grunts) - [Tongue] Hold me back. - Hey, you piece of shit! (grunts) (yelling) Nobody fucks with me. (hitting) (grunting) (hits) (grunts) (splashing) (heavy breathing) (Candy whimpering) Oh god, baby, be reasonable. (Candy whimpering) (tongue grunting) (Candy whimpering) I've gotta do it. (pickaxe clatters) I can't do it. (Rita grunts) (all yelling) - [Tongue] My legs! My legs! Oh, what have you done to my legs? Oh, oh, oh, oh. Hasta manana, maybe. (groans) (sobbing) (Candy whimpering) - [Candy] I don't want anymore laughing tongues, no more talking dogs, no more paper money, no more paper men. I'd rather stay in and watch the circus from the outside. No redemption, no forgiveness. But hope. Only hope. (soft Spanish music) (upbeat Spanish music) (upbeat Spanish music)
