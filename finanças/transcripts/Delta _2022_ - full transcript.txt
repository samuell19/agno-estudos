You've burnt the coffee again. You always burn it! This is now a protected area. You can't fish here anymore, the army is arresting everyone. - Nobody will arrest us. - Yeah, they won't arrest us... Do you want some coffee? This is the third net we've lost this week. Did you hear? Either we stop fishing or we leave! And where do you want to go? Where...? - Let's go to Italy. - In Italy? I speak Italian, miss. What beautiful eyes you have. Come on, or he'll get pissed off! Shall we buy a Ferrari? Do you know the noise a Ferrari makes? Stop fucking around. Enough of Italy and Ferraris! This is our home... these are our canals. Dad, it's decided, we're leaving tomorrow! Look at this! We'll never get finished. Here you are. - This? - What is it? - What an idiot. - We'll take it home. Have you seen the foam? Look, there's even a fridge. Are these people crazy? - Shall we remove it? - It won't fit in the car. Look for a rope, something to pull it up. Someone's dumped a fridge here. At Napoleonico, if anyone's passing with a van, they could load it up. I'll take a water sample and we'll leave. Damn... what are those? - Nani? - What is it? Come and see. Mayor Carp's arrived. Fuck you. - Come on, guys... - Leila... Come on, let's get started. Come on, guys. Sandro, come on. Leave the card game, come on, let's start. Right... I called this meeting because they've started dumping again. We'd achieved a certain result, with the protests, the demonstrations, but we're back where we started. The industrialists have started dumping crap into the river again, and this means, as you well know, that everything will start up again, rates of tumours will go sky high, fish dying, a disaster. We all need to act right away. I've already notified the Carabinieri chief... Are you done with this shit? - Let's have a barbecue. - What the fuck are you doing, Zanna? I found them in front of my house. Bloody hell... you're such a prick! It's a burn from an electric stunner, this, eh? It's not the factories. These are poachers, people from the East, animals! - But have you seen them? - They're like ghosts. They pull up their nets and vanish. We need to organise patrols on the banks. It's chemical. No, I make a living with fish. What are you talking about? I make a huge effort to comply with the fishing zones that are imposed on us to repopulate this fucking river. Then these people come, two shocks and they lift out fish by the ton, and I've to sit here wanking about? - Let's stay calm. - He's right. That's enough. We're talking shit. What shit? The bosses have been discharging into the river for 20 years. What bosses? The times have changed here. We have other problems, do you understand or not? Maybe they've changed for you, but not for me. Has anyone else seen these ghosts? Right, then... - We'll do what we usually do. - Dickhead! Oh, great, do what you usually do. - You fuck-all! - We'll do what we've always done. Yeah, do what you've always done. Come on, then. Come on! - Wait, I'll help you. - Thanks. Go. What's with the eyeliner? No reason. - Anna, can I talk to you for a second? - Yes. This came for you. 130 km/hour on the Romea road... The HGVs use that road, Anna. Yes, listen, we need to sort this car thing out, so when I get a fine you don't have to bring it to me. It's OK, it's not a problem for me. - What an idiot you are! - What are you doing? - Mind your own business. - What did you say to her? - Come on, leave me alone. - What did you say to Anna? What did I say to her? Nothing. What's Zanna been smoking? "The times have changed"... We lost our father because of industrial waste. Listen, though, Zanna lives 20 kilometres from Napoleonico, right? So? - There was a spill there as well, then. - Let's take a look. Let's go. The next time you interfere I'll stop talking to you. And the moon knocked at the doors of darkness Let me in! He answered no And the moon knocked where there was silence... Well? Turn up the volume. It's been two years since she walked out. - Who? - Who, Anna! - So? - So life goes on! I kept going. Look, in these two years your brother's done a load of things. Such as? To start with... We founded the association, a great thing. Then? Then I became site manager at the dam which was always my dream. Don't laugh, without the dam, we'd all be underwater, eh? Now you're here too working with me and that makes me very happy. That's up to you, if you like it, you can stay on, it seems to me you're very good at it. What do you say? And so by chance She went down Closer to the pavements Where what you see is true So... she went down Without knocking... - Did you see that? - What? - Did you see it? - What? There's a van down on the floodplain. Stop, stop. What are you doing, don't touch. Stop it, come on. Let's take the pictures for the chief. What are you doing? Nani, get out of this van. Get out, will you, Nani? Guys, we found them, they're here near Zanna's house. Close this van. Don't touch. Leave things alone. - You see? - What is it? Shall I call the chief? - Hey, wait. - Stay here. We're river rangers, what are you doing? Who the hell are you? Fishermen. Never mind the fish! - Do you have a licence? - Fishermen... - I understand, your licence. - Let me see. - Let me see it, I said. - Yes, the licence... - Let me see it! - Yes, the licence... What licence? Leave the fish! Hey, we're river rivers, we're carrying out a routine check. Nani, let's go. Come away! Easy, keep calm. Let's go. Easy. - Who were they? - I don't know. He doesn't know... We've just got here and they've caught us already! We're going to have problems with them as well. What will we do if they come back? 30 kilos! - 30 kilos! - That's what it is! Put them all on, one on top of the other. Put some ice on it. Load the fish on to the truck. Fuck. Elena, come here. It's soft. That's enough! Stop! - Stop! - He's here. Get away! Come on! Get away! Load up! Causo, we've not finished loading. - You need to stop fishing. - We've not finished loading. They found out about you in the village. Causo, we'll only fish in the dark, nobody will see us. What does he want? Will you let us work? Stop for two or three weeks, then we'll see. Come on. I'll speak to him. You haven't given us anything for two months. Stop for two or three weeks, then we'll see. Come on. - Give me the 1,600 you owe me. - You owe us 4,000. Don't you move. I'll speak to him. By the way, you haven't given us anything for two months. Go! What are you doing? Open this van! Open this van, Causo! The van's mine. The fish is mine. I'll give you the money when I decide. Fuck off, you piece of shit! Do you understand? What'll we do? Causo, where are you going? Come here, let's talk. Come here, let's talk, Causo! Causo! We need to talk. Who is he? We're closed. Let's talk! Causo, come out. We're closed! We're closed! - We need to talk. - Fuck off! We need to talk... I'll do it. Causo! Open the door! Let's us two talk. You better not show your faces, or I'll be caught up in it. - You need to give me the fish money! - I understand, come inside. A coffee, please. You transport the fish, we catch it... the money is ours as well! It's always the money with you. I'm not leaving here without our money! I'm sorry, you can't smoke in here. Why not? Smoking hasn't been allowed in bars for 15 years. - How much is it? - One euro. Aren't you from around here? No. Yes, you are, you're Elia. You were always at Boscone, you lived in the abandoned house. I always came with friends when we skipped school, I remember! You said my face looked like a frying pan. - Me? - Yes, like this... no nose. - Sorry. - It's OK. Thank you. I'm going, see you. Can you make me a cigarette as well? Thank you. So you're back? I mean... do you live here now? No. What did he say? He didn't say shit and he didn't give us shit. He says he has problems with the bank. He says we have to wait. Elia, we need to get organised without him. Come inside, come on. Move. - Well? - It's sorted. What's sorted? We reported it, we gave them the video, now they have to deal with it. Yes, but if they empty the river, it's illegal... does the chief not give a damn? As soon as we see them again, we'll call him. If they don't catch them fishing, they can't do anything. We have to do it ourselves. I'm going to the club, see you there? See you there? See you there. Step by step, let's go step by step. Let's see who they are, patrol, map the territory. Then, when we find where they are, we tell the Chief. What do you still need to map, if we saw them here, then we saw them here and then... - Here as well. - Where? Here. So this is where we need to look, Osso. We start from the Ponte della Trava and go to the Delta. - They're here in Boscone. - Well done! What do you think, Nani? That they're waiting for you, like lovely little statues? When you find them, then what? We beat them up until they go back home. - He's obsessed. - Yes, but he wants to do something. But we're doing something as well, we're looking after the river. We founded the environmentalist association. But it's peaceful, we're not soldiers. So explain to me why we load up the fridges, clean the banks, carry out surveys, if these people come and empty the river? Do you know who these people are? Maybe they're armed. Do we wanna start a war, are we crazy? No, but we have to be organised, look for them, be faster than them, Osso. I know you're afraid. I'm afraid as well. But nobody gives a damn here. What did the chief say, Osso? He has bigger problems. But I give a damn. This is our home, isn't it? If we don't do this, no one else will. Anyone who feels like it... see you at three, at the entrance to Boscone. OK. All right. Come on, we can do it. We have to be united, Osso. Where are you going? Be careful, these people are out of their minds. Let him go... Where are you going? We have to stick together. - Who are you? What do you want? - I'm looking for Elia. Who's Elia? This is my house, what do you want? - I'm looking for Elia. - Calm down. Come here, come on. What is it? What's she doing here in my house? Come in, it's only Elia's friend. - I know her. - Who is it? She's my friend. - Come inside. - Go into the fucking house! Who's this? Elia, what are you doing? She's your friend... You're screwing her... - You're screwing her... - Come on, pull him up. Wait a moment. Give me a hand. Come on, help me, I'll leave you alone. How big was this fucking carp? He had a 100-pound carp. I had a hard time getting it on to the trailer. - 100 kilos? - Where? - What fish? Where? - Don't you believe me? The one that weighed 100 kilos, it was this big! How big? Show me, here on the table! Let me see. - The carp weighed so much. - Don't talk shit. - Pass the dishes. Put them here. - What carp? Forget it! - It was as big as your daughter. - Enough of this story! I'm being serious! Listen... do you work for Causo? - Do you work for Causo? - For Causo... at the bar. At the bar! - Do you work at the bar? - Yes. Causo, that arsehole we work for... Yes. Luiza... pass her some boiled fish, let's see if she likes it. Go to Uncle! Put me a drink! And why did you come here? Why did you come here? I don't understand. Why did she come here? He wants to know why you're here. - Because people are looking for you. - Who? The rangers... people from the club... they're looking for you. - What's she saying? - That they're looking for us. - They're looking for us? - Who? Do you know something... We'll stop fishing for two or three nights... without the Italian and when we start again, we'll tell him to fuck off. You still don't believe this story, even if you were there with me. - Yes, I was. But how big was it? - It was gigantic. - That fish was as big as the girl. - What are you saying? - He doesn't want to believe me. - Bloody hell! You've told this story a thousand times, no one believes it anymore. Bullshit. - A 100-kilo fish? - What? - Give me some grappa here! - It's not like that. - She really liked the grappa! - Go, pass, pass, pass. Where? Come on, stop! Oh, you're great together. Cheers! This is my family. I was fishing... one day, on the river... and I saw them. I don't even remember what it was like before. But it's great. Now it's great, and then... we'll see. Take this. Come on, gimme this! Are you coming to see a place? A place? Yes. - Yes. - You coming? Yes. Come here. Come on. You've slept two hours for three nights to keep up with Zanna. The chief said to tell him if we see something, not to play at being cops. Come on, man, let's not start again. This isn't just our problem, all right? I forgot to tell you something... The other day I went to the storeroom to look for something... In the big box, the one with Dad's photo plate, the one we hung up, I found a roll of film that Dad never developed. - Dad's? - A roll of Dad's film. I borrowed the stuff for the dark room from Sergetto and I'm going to develop it tonight. But can you do it? You won't ruin everything? - You wanna help me? - I told you, I'm going out, I can't. And what are you doing? Where are you going? Come on, stay home tonight. We'll develop the film together. It's been there 40 years, can you imagine Dad? We only have that one photo in the lounge of him as a young man. Help m out, OK? We'll do it together. I'll be back for dinner, OK? Oh, wait! Wait, I said! - River rangers, what are you doing? - Fishermen. Do you have a licence? - Fishermen. - I understand, your licence. - Let me see it, I said! - Yes, the licence. We're river rangers... we're carrying out a routine check. Be good. Nani, come here. Nani, let's go. Let's go! Come away! Beginning to make this movement for a minute. Then, every now and then... I bang it... to prevent the formation... At this point, we open... the tank... we take everything out... and we take the tank to the tap. We leave it... 15, 20 minutes... We mustn't be afraid in our own home. Go with the clubs, come on. Go, take them. I want to feel safe in my own home. Causo? No, I don't look at the group chat, I left. What? Are you sure it's them? Is my sister there too? Don't do anything... I'll call the chief. Oh, I mean it, don't do anything, eh! Come on, they're there. The truck driver loads up and takes the fish to Bucharest. Then he pays us when he gets back. Dad, come on, we have to go! Look, there's a boat here! Ready. This engine's worth 3,000 euros. Look at me. You're not coming to my place. Do you understand Italian? Repeat it! I want you to repeat it. What did I say? Do you understand Italian? Zanna! Zanna! Nani, where are you? Stop! Stop! Listen, open the back and show us what you have. Get out! I don't understand, what happens? Show us what's in the back. Open it! Open the back! Open it! Look how much there is. This is an electric stunner. What are you doing with this? Come on, let's take everything. Confiscate the lot. It's over, it's all over, don't worry. We're going home. I'll take you home. What happened? Bring him inside. We were fishing and they caught us. They beat me up, they nearly killed me. They really beat me up. - They caught us there. - Where's Leon? I don't know. The Carabinieri stopped him. We have to get away from here. We can't take it anymore. I want to go home. How do we do it? We have to get the money from the Italian and leave. We have to go home. What the fuck are you doing here? Do you know what happened? I told you to stop. What the fuck have you done? Give me the money. Give me the money, come on. I already gave the money to your friend... What the fuck are you doing here? I'll kill you, you piece of shit! Come outside. Come out, you piece of shit! Causo... don't move! Anna, I know you're with this guy! Come out, I know you're with him! I'll kill you! Come out! - Come out! - Don't move! No! No! I'll kill you! He defended me, tht's all! Anna, you're not helping me, though! So, you told me... Causo was here, There was a fight. This guy defended you. But why did he defend you, did you know him? Who is this? What's his name? He had this brown jacket, and what else? Where the fuck were you? Where the fuck were you? Hey, watch your tone, eh! Either you calm her down or you get her away. This arsehole has been questioning me for three hours! This arsehole! You go and find him! What the fuck do you want? Oh, take it easy, take it easy. How's Causo doing? Bad? Will you take me home, please? Take me home! - I want to go home! - Yes, but calm down. - I want to go home. - Calm down. I'll take you home. We'll go home right away, calm down. Let's go. Come. It wasn't a robbery. He defended me, you understand? He defended me. Hey, stop! Eh, Osso! Let me talk to the chief, I want to see those bastards cry! Let us through! He's our friend! You still saying nothing, still silent! Nothing's changed here, eh? - What? - Nothing's changed here. - Nani likes it this way. - Yes... Where are the glasses? - Would you like some water? - Yes. Nobody believes me. Come on... Try to calm down now. It's over now. Come on, come on! - I'm sorry. - Come on, don't worry. - I'm sorry... - You need to rest now, eh? Right... Do you love me? It's so good to have you here. The search will continue after dark. Prosecutors have confirmed he is armed and dangerous. PO DELTA: ROBBERY ENDS IN TRAGEDY The chief prosecutor of Bologna has made a statement. This is his message... Stay at home. Don't undertake any risky journeys and if you see anything suspicious... Oh, he's dead... - Causo's dead. - Oh, calm down, I get it, I get it. - Where's my sister? - We're going to get him, he's local. They're criminally insanes, let's finish this now! - Did you understand what I said? - Yes. Let's finish this now, enough! - Finish what now? - Get out... you insane criminal! What are you doing with this? What the fuck are you doing with a gun? - Leave her alone, come on! - Get it inside! Listen to me! He lives here, in Boscone, the chief told me. Do you know that she was at his house as well? You understand who she is? That's why you're defending him, right? Come on, let's go. At his house? So what? So what, does it change anything? Get your stuff now and go to your house. Get out of here! Hide! Hide! Go to the other side, these people kill us! - Run, run! - The girl! Take the girl away! Fire as soon as they get out the cars, don't let them in! Put them away. Give them to Leon when he gets back. Elia, hide, we'll deal with it! Look at this fucking place. Where are you going? Stay here! Down, get down! He shoots from the window. Stop there! Don't move, Nani! Stop! What the fuck do you want! Get out of here! - Come on, come on! Fire if you dare! - Get out of my house! I'll kill you! - Get out of here! - I'll come up and smash your skull! - I'll kill you all! Damn you! - Get down! Come on, come on, come on! Stay here. Shut up, shitface! Come on, come on! Get out of my house! I'll kill you all! Everything okay? Tell me where he is. You're not going to get away with this. Look how much stuff there is. - Look how much stuff there is! - Please, stop. What do you want from us? Talk, tell me where he is. Leave us! Where is he? Where's the bastard hiding, where is he? Is he through there, where is he? Do you understand Italian? Where the fuck's he hiding? Did you hear that? Right... This is a man who is armed. Now we'll beat the floodplain step by step to find where he's hiding. He's injured. He's wearing a brown jacket with a hood. If you spot anything suspicious, sound the alarm immediately. All right? Come on, come on, let's go! Come on! Go! Come on! OK, stay tight, stay close. I'm alone. I didn't tell anyone you were here! You can't stay here. Go away, go away! - Wait... - I said to go away! Go home, go! Go home, go! Listen to me! Listen to me... Listen to me! - You can't stay here. - Listen to me. Listen to me. I saw what you did. I saw you kill him to defend me. Let's go away together. Look at the fish here! Fucking poachers! Come on. Come on! Come on. Come away. - What the fuck are you doing? - Leave her alone. Mind your own fucking business. What are you doing, eh? What are you thinking, eh? What are you thinking? What are you thinking? Can you explain to me what's wrong? Let's go. Let's go. Go, go! What's that? - Where? - Turn... Go... go... go. Go, do! Turn, turn... Water, throw water on it! Get the bucket! Faster, Dad, they're burning the nets. It's all on fire! Where the fuck are you going? Stop! Elia, stop him! Stop him, Elia! - Dad... - Leave me alone! Let me in... my whole life's in there. - Dad! - Leave me alone! I want to go in! Let's load up. This is my cousin's contact. The van's waiting for you at the market. It leaves at dawn. - What are you going to do? - I don't know. We'll leave tonight, we'll get out of here. I shouldn't have brought you here. Don't worry. This is how things were meant to be. Forgive me. I don't want to be here anymore. Mullet... 3 euros. 2,50. 2 euros. Sold. Carp... 4 euros. 3.50. 3 euros. Sold. Catfish, 3 euros. 2.50. 2 euros. Sold. Why are we wasting time with this shit? We're only doing our duty. Our duty is to be on the river with the others. Yeah, burning people's homes? There are rules, Nani. It's just that you're scared shitless. I protect you, I've always protected you. What about everything I gave up for you? Who asked you to? You need to stop using me as an excuse for fucking doing nothing. Why do you always have to take it and not react, why? Why do you always have to suffer, why? Chief, I'll help check in the back. Stop. The manhunt is continuing. A man on the run, wanted for two murders in one week... He has been confirmed to be dangerous. The hunt continues day and night on the ground and from the air... 150 Carabinieri are looking for him... It's full of abandoned farmhouses... The manhunt continues with the aim of tightening the circle... Around the area where the fugitive is thought to be. He's on foot, among the canals, he's armed, he's very dangerous. People are afraid. Where are you going? Let me go, please. I want to go away, please. - Anna, it's me. - No. - Anna, it's me, look at me. - No, please. - I want to go away! - Anna, look at me. Let me go, please. - Do you want to go away? - Yes. - Yes. - Go. Go away. Go away! Go away! Go away. Go away. Go away. I don't need anyone. I don't need anyone. I don't need anyone. I don't need anyone. Nobody! Let her through. Tell me where he is. I beg you! Take her away. Take her to the station. Hey, stop! You can't go this way, go back. They've seen him. On the other side! Go back, on the other side! Stop! Don't move! Go! He's slipped under there. Don't move! I've lost him! Oh, I said not to lose him! Don't move. Don't move! Behave! Where are you going, eh? Stay where you are! Behave! You're mine now. Now you're mine! You're not going anywhere! You're not going anywhere! You can't run anymore. You're done. You're not going anywhere! I'll kill you! Do you understand? I can't believe it. So you're from here? You're from here, eh? Where the fuck were you? I've never seen you before. Who the fuck are you? Why the fuck did you leave here? What did you come back for? Did you come back to kill my sister? To kill my sister! Now I'll kill you. Now I'll kill you. Now. Now I'll kill you. Now I'll kill you. I didn't want to kill anyone. We spend a lifetime fighting against ourselves... trying to be better. But we are what we are. Easy. Calm down, easy. - Give me your jacket. - What the fuck do you want it for? Give me your jacket, come on! Go down this way. Go. Start it up. Come up. Come on! Get down! Get down!
