This film is based on actual events but it is not a precise reenactment of the events and characters herein. "When you light a bonfire, "you know how it begins, but not how it ends." Sun Tzu: Author of the Chinese book "The Art of War" Early May 1967 Why is Eshkol half a consolation? Because misery loves company. Good one. -Yes. Dubi, turn the radio on to the news. Levi Eshkol Prime Minister and Defense Minister This is the Voice of Israel from Jerusalem, good morning. It's 7 a.m., here is the news report. What's the difference between Eshkol and James Bond, Agent 007? What? The 7. Stop it, he'll be here any minute. Just one more. -One. -One. A waiter asked Eshkol: What would you like, tea or coffee? -I know this one. -Eshkol replied... Half coffee... and half tea. Well, I see that you're jolly. "Eshkol Jokes" Mr. Prime Minister, forgive me. That's alright. I'm in good company. Churchill was the butt of jokes too. Shifra, the last discussion on the Nat'l Water Carrier, I want the summary by 10:00. -No problem. Will you people get it done? -You people? You and the little guy. -Sure, it's here. Yona. -Yes? Make me tea. Do you want tea as well? Just one. Both halves, just tea. Yona, I told you to stop. Adi? -Yes? -What do we have today? 09:00 - a meeting with the representatives of the Negev towns regarding the Incentives Law. 10:00 - the board of the military industry. 11:00 - a discussion on expanding the Nat'l Carrier, 12:00 - a meeting with the Australian ambassador and at 14:00 - lunch with Golda. Sir, I apologize. Don't be silly, Yona. A man without self-deprecating humor is not a serious man. Thank you. Yona, just a minute. Yona, I'm warning you! I'm warning you, if you hear a really good joke about me, you better tell me. Promise? I promise. Riki Shelach Productions present: A film by Gideon Ganani "The Man Who Tried to Prevent a War" May 15, 1967 Independence Day After the Parade in Jerusalem Ladies and Gentlemen, Ladies and Gentlemen, Prime Minister Levi Eshkol and his wife, distinguished ministers, officers and diplomatic corps, best wishes to the State of Israel, its government and citizens. May peace reign on Israel and its neighbors, may Israel continue to prosper. Le'chaim, le'chaim. To you. To you. Miriam Eshkol The Prime Minister's wife Here he oozes niceties, but in France he doesn't miss an opportunity to defame us. Diplomats, that's what they're paid for. To say one thing then talk behind your back. If not, he's not a diplomat. Like all the politicians. Wait here. Oh, there's Yitzhak. Mr. Prime Minister. -Yitzhak, you don't have a glass. May I have a word with you in private? It's alright, Eshkol tells me everything at home... Yitzhak Rabin Chief of Staff What's wrong? -Nasser. What about him? He's deploying troops to the Sinai. Intelligence reports at least two divisions advancing towards the Sinai in addition to the two already there. Now of all times? Couldn't he wait until after the holiday? Do you think it's serious? It doesn't look good. I would like to mobilize one reserve division for now. Let's wait with the reserves, make do with putting the active army on alert. After the holiday, the government will convene to decide on calling up the reserves. You report to me on the goings on in the meantime. Are you sure? The deployment of their troops is in full swing. A day or two won't make a difference. Alright... in any case, happy holiday. Or what's left of it. Let's get back to the ceremony. Anything interesting? Nothing new in the Levant. May 17, 1967 - Government session As we speak, the Egyptians are deploying troops to the Sinai. Ahrale, enlighten our colleagues on the background to this development. Maj. Gen. Aharon Yariv - Head of Intelligence Directorate After we shot down 6 Syrian MIGs in April, the Russians took it harder than the Syrians. Of course. It's Western weapons against Soviet weapons. Exactly. We intercepted a message in which the Russians informed that we're amassing forces by the Syrian border to attack Syria. It all begins with the Russians. -Have we been amassing? Not one Israeli soldier was added to the sector. There's the same number of troops as before to protect the towns below from the Syrians. I suggested that the Russian ambassador go see for himself that we haven't reinforced our troops. Moscow was against it. As usual, they won't let the facts confuse them. If this deployment can be used to attack within little time, we must position a larger force against them. Meanwhile it's only the active army. (Maj. Gen. Ezer Weizman -Head of Intelligence Directorate) That's David versus many Goliaths. Our ambassador in the United States met with the American Under Secretary of State. (Abba Eban, Foreign Minister) The Under Secretary asked that we not give in to provocations and maintain restraint. Radio Cairo informs that Egypt demands the evacuation of the UN troops. That was to be expected, but ousting the observers still isn't cause for war. In any event, I ask for permission to mobilize two armored corps divisions. Take it easy... (Moshe Shapira, Minister of the Interior) We must be cautious, not give the Egyptians reason to attack us. Rabbi Shapira, don't panic. The Egyptians don't need any reason from us. Is there any objection to Yitzhak's request for mobilization? Then permission is granted. Two armored corps divisions will be mobilized. And we'll reinforce our active army in the north. This session is closed. Mobilization of reserves begins See you, my dear girls. Go. Newsreel The Israeli street has changed. The phrase, "The nation is an army" has taken on its past meaning. The tense wait is the most difficult, at times even harder than the fighting itself. Yet, morale is high and team spirit strong. Meanwhile in the field, soldiers dig trenches and remain on the alert. A few things about the Jewish Investors' convention. Postpone it until we see where we stand. We may have unexpected expenses, if you know what I mean. Another thing. Dayan wants to patrol the front. I don't think he should. Why? On the contrary. Give him a vehicle and guards. Are you sure? -Yes, why not? We'll hear what that bandit has to say. "We have no intentions to attack." I appeal from this podium May 22, 1967 Eshkol address in the Knesset to the Arab countries and our friends in the world, we have no intentions to attack. We do not want to harm the security of any of our neighbors. This is the time to display restraint and levelheadedness to prevent a downward spiral. Egypt's response to Eshkol's speech: President Nasser reviews the mobilization of tanks towards the Sinai and rouses the Egyptian people and the Arab world with his address. "The Merry Wives of Windsor" Miriam. -What is it, has war broken out? Not so fast. Is that good? -Really, it's Shakespeare. -It's Shakespeare... We won't debate who is greater and... -Well, well. Miriam, what is Nasser up to? What's this madness that's gotten into him? Nasser is like a dog, the more he barks, the more he believes that he can bite. Small dog, big noise. But I think he'll try to bite and it's my job to prevent that. You see, Mr. Prime Minister? As long as you're in charge, I can sleep soundly. And you're invited too. You have a long day tomorrow. I have a few thoughts. Good night. -Good night. By the way, there's no dispute. Shakespeare is the greatest of all. So be it, Shakespeare is the greatest of all. But Pushkin is greater. I heard you. "On a bleak day" "In discouraging thunder of chaos" "Did your pleasant image glow and your majestic voice play." Could Shakespeare have written anything like that? May 23, 1967 Nasser closes the Straits of Tiran to Israeli ships and meets with pilots in Bir Gifgafa The Jews are threatening to wage war. We say to them: Be our guests, we are prepared for war. Soldier. May 23, 1967 Government session following the blockade of the Straits The dog started by barking and now he believes that he can bite? That's what my wife said. That proves that she knows about dogs too. If we don't react to the closing of the Straits, we'll lose our credibility and deterrence capability. Besides, we detected two Egyptian aircrafts conducting reconnaissance sorties near the reactor in Dimona. Nasser is liable to exploit this situation to blow up the reactor. Start a war over a textile factory? That's a bit much, wouldn't you say? Time, people, is not on our side. As long as we don't take action, the Egyptians get stronger and we get weaker. We must make a preemptive strike. Excuse me, at least... at least seize Gaza in return for the opening of the Straits. "Rabin smokes like a chimney" If not, we could end up the barking dogs that don't bite. Johnson asked that we wait at least 48 hours. We have a friend in the White House. We mustn't lose him. I am going to send someone to talk to him and the administration leaders to get more explicit promises from them. Before we procure American support, a preemptive strike is out of the question. Does anyone want to add something? The session is closed. Mr. Prime Minister. -Yes? May I? -Of course, of course. You said that you're going to send someone to speak to the administration. Who is that someone? It has to be someone who can open doors and mainly hearts. I was thinking of Golda. She's an American after all. With all due respect, I think it's the foreign minister's job. If Sir would like to replace me with Golda, that's your right. Within minutes I will place my letter of resignation on your desk. Fine, you go. It's important... -Yes? That you emphasize to Johnson that opening the Straits is important, but the deployment of Egyptian troops in the Sinai is an existential threat. I have a small request. They're not all Cambridge alumni. Johnson is just a big fellow who grew up on a ranch in Texas. Talk to him in an English that he can understand. I shall take heed of your words. Thank you. -Good luck. I hope Johnson brings an interpreter. "Herzliya Newsreel" Other parties too grappled with the issue. Their boards and official institutions discussed the situation and met with Labor party representatives. The widespread mobilization of reserves only to remain idle gives rise to public and government criticism against Levi Eshkol. "Replace Prime Minister and Defense Minister Levi Eshkol with David Ben Gurion." "Levi Eshkol is not suited to be defense minister." Who's that? -Name it. That's what all the papers are saying. Suddenly everyone's a big man. And what's even funnier is that they want Ben Gurion back. He swore that he wouldn't sit with me. And besides, he's against war, from what I heard. Eshkol, from now on, no more reading the papers. It keeps you from concentrating on the important matters. Let the reporters write and you'll do what has to be done. The dogs bark and the caravan moves on. And don't forget to take your pills. I wish everyone was like you. I'm more than everyone, I'm your wife. Yes. I was lucky. Very lucky. -True. Otherwise you'd be still be a womanizer and making a fool of yourself. Don't be ridiculous. Me too, Levi. -What? I was very lucky I met you. Adi, there's this issue. I spoke to Chief Medical Officer Dr. Gilon, Rabin isn't feeling well, he'll have to take a few days off. Ezer will replace him as IDF commander. That's all I needed. He's worth a few divisions to the Arabs. Let's go in. Please come in. Mr. Prime Minister, Mr. Begin wants to talk to you. Please. Yes. Sit down. Well, what do you want? Do you want to join the government, Begin? Mr. Prime Minister, Knesset Member Menachem Begin Opposition Chairman (Herut-Liberals Bloc) I don't know where to start. From the end. It's always best to start from the end. The situation is complex. The people have lost their sense of security. A leader is needed to restore their sense of security. You're referring to Ben Gurion. He'll be prime minister and defense minister, you'll be his deputy. We talked to him. He refused at first, but then he came around. If you agree, we can join the government. At times of war, there is no coalition or opposition. We are all a coalition. I tell you now, these two horses, Ben Gurion and I, will not pull this cart together. Anything else? There is another option. Dayan. He'll replace you as defense minister, you'll remain prime minister. The National Religious Party supports this. Is that true? -Yes. The National Religious Party will support a multi-party government. Appointing Dayan will allow us to add "Herut" and the Liberals to the government. You'll remain prime minister, first among equals. I promise to think about it. I'm glad. -But obviously, I don't promise to commit. Thank you for coming to visit, Begin. -Thank you. Thank you for your time. "The starling did go to the raven." All of a sudden, Begin is a fan of Ben Gurion. For 30 years Ben Gurion made his life miserable. And Shapira? Against war and for Dayan. That's a contradiction. Get me Dayan, I want to see him at once. I was in the midst of a patrol. Did something happen? No, I wanted to hear your thoughts. From what I could see, it looks good. The main problem is the wait. It harms the soldiers and the morale. Lt. Gen. (Res.) Moshe Dayan Chief of Staff during the 1956 Suez Crisis The soldiers are questioning the leadership. You mean me? -I didn't say that. I'm referring to the overall feeling. Someone suggested having you join the security cabinet as a minister without a portfolio. Tell that someone that I don't intend to be a consultant. What do you call it? An advice giver? I won't fulfill a position that has no substance or ability to impact. Such as... defense minister? That's what you said. Those words didn't come out of my mouth. I'll make do with commanding over the southern front. It won't fly, I checked with Gavish, and this is no time for upheavals in the army. Then tell me what role you want me to fill and I'm with you. Otherwise, tell the guys to prepare the APC for me. Moshe? What is your recommendation? I have three recommendations. Attack, attack and attack. We'll consider it when the time comes. Let's hope it won't be too late. That man with one eye has more hidden intentions than someone with two eyes. Support in the political establishment for appointing Dayan defense minister increases. On May 24, Yigal Alon returns from a two week visit in the USSR. In an attempt to curb the support of Dayan, Eshkol offers Alon the position. Maj. Gen. (Res.) Yigal Alon - Labor party Deputy prime minister and labor minister Hello, Eshkol. Look who's here! -How are you? -Welcome. -Thank you. A guest from the Soviet Union, lucky they let you out of there, ah? Before everyone arrives, I wanted to talk to you in private. Thank you for your offer. -Yes. -But I can't accept it. The people want someone else for the job. Don't rush, take your time. Think about it. No, no, my decision is final. I can't fill a role as some compromise. Yigal Alon, a compromise? Yigal Alon, Palmach commander, a compromise? The people think otherwise and you know it. Thank you. Good luck. May 27, 1967 Government session The Egyptians keep reinforcing their troops in the Sinai and we know that the fourth division, the flagship of the Egyptian armored corps, is already there. Yesterday Nasser was quoted in "Al-Ahram" as saying: "If we're attacked, Israel will be annihilated." We must call it as we see it. Even if the American request resulted in a delay of the Egyptian attack, the noose around our necks is getting tighter with each passing day. Everyone agrees. The major threat is not the closing of the Straits, rather the deployment of the Egyptian army in the Sinai. Mr. Prime Minister... Minister Eban, welcome. -Yes. Well, you had a long flight. I slept the entire flight. Then speak and illuminate us. -Yes. I met with Johnson, he is a true friend and supporter of Israel. He is determined to assemble an international armada to break through the Straits. He objects to us acting on our own accord. There is logic to his position and I tend to side with it. We keep saying that the real threat is the Egyptian army in the Sinai. I don't understand why they insist on the Straits. It is my impression that the American Intelligence doesn't accept our approach. They believe that the Egyptian troops in the Sinai pose no threat to Israel. I am examining the issue from a military perspective. The prime minister is right. The main problem is the increase of troops in the Sinai that threaten our existence. I don't doubt that the IDF can crush the Egyptian armored corps and air force on its own, without external assistance. Yigal, welcome home. After two days of discussions the government decides to abide by President Johnson's request to wait. From "Herzliya Newsreel" A visit to the IDF units in the south. The prime minister and his entourage are welcomed by the Southern Front commander and the Armored Corps commander. The prolonged wait intensifies the criticism against the government and its leader. Levi Eshkol decides to address the people. We will listen to this address by Prime Minister and Defense Minister Levi Eshkol. Dear citizens, the government convened today to discuss the situation. The threat to Israel given the deployment of the Egyptian army in the Sinai is well founded. The government of Israel determines that closing the Straits of Tiran to Israeli ships is an act of aggression against Israel. The foreign minister reported on his talks with the French president, the British prime minister and the American president. In addition, action plans were determined to... Adi, what is this? What is this, Adi? Sir, we are live. Action plans to remove the forces. Action plans to remove the forces, yes. -Go ahead. In addition... Wait, where is it? I found it. Action plans were determined to remove the military forces from Israel's southern border and to maintain our sovereign rights. That was Prime Minister and Defense Minister Levi Eshkol. Fuck! An incompetent prime minister. Calm down, man! So the prime minister wasn't very eloquent. He'll be judged by his actions, not his talk. No more stuttering! No more stuttering! No more stuttering! No more stuttering! "The Merry Wives of Windsor" Women for Dayan as defense minister Dayan as defense minister! Dayan as defense minister! "The Merry Wives of Windsor," this is what the prime minister calls the group of women in favor of Dayan's appointment. I am here with Yael, an organizer of these protests. Yael, your reaction? "The Merry Wives of Windsor" is a play by Shakespeare, but this is no theater, this is reality. We are all following the prime minister's hesitant conduct since the crisis began, conduct that reached new heights with his fumbling radio address. Israel needs a person with a distinct voice who can make a decision. There is only one such person in Israel. Moshe Dayan! Look, my husband was called up. I know what the army thinks. The reactions to his address were harsh. Some soldiers even burst out in tears. We will all, and especially our soldiers, feel much safer when Dayan is appointed defense minister. -Right! And this will sow fear among our enemy. -Right. Thank you, Yael. No more stuttering! No more stuttering! Bring us Dayan! Bring us Dayan! "Replace Eshkol, the stuttering defense minister" I established "Mekorot", I initiated the National Carrier, I procured airplanes from the United States. All that dwarfs in comparison to one little stutter on the radio. I don't understand why the big deal? The prime minister read off a sheet that someone put shoddy, illogical changes in so he got confused. Even the finest radio announcer would have been confused by it. Eshkol, pull yourself together. Adi, sway the journalists. Emphasize that the prime minister will be judged by his actions, not his skill as a radio announcer. I did that, but they are behind the people and they're emphasizing his stuttering. Then try again. Find a leading journalist and promise him a scoop. All we need is one major journalist to put this whole thing in perspective. If you ask me, what worries me most is the impact of the address on the army. There are people there who are very displeased. Adi, schedule a meeting for me with the General Staff. Hello. -Hello. Meeting with members of the General Staff Sit down. -Hello, people. Hello. Gentlemen, the prime minister is here to listen and to say his piece. Would you like to begin? As you said, Yitzhak, I'll listen first, then speak. Ezer. We are busy lobbying. We must attack at once. Waiting is to our detriment, it conveys weakness. Besides, the enemy could attack us first and then we'll lose the element of surprise, which almost happened a few days ago. I don't understand what you're afraid of. After all, just last month we shot down six Syrian planes. We built an air force attack plan based on the element of surprise (Maj. Gen. Moti Hod - IAF Commander) which should bring an end to the battle within the first hours. The longer we wait, the harder it will be to carry out. It could leak out. The army is mobilized, but inactive. The economy is at a standstill. I have one question, Sir, how long do you think the State of Israel can exist in a situation such as this? We're sawing off our most formidable weapon against the Arabs - their fear of us. And keep in mind the people's low morale given the indecision. We have a strong army that can do the job, but your hesitation will lead us to thousands of casualties. Gentlemen, we all agree that the situation is complex. Let's say that we decide to attack now and destroy the Egyptian army. That won't be the end of it. It will rebuild itself. There will be no revival of the State of Israel if we take action without our friends' support, especially when the Russians are so much against us. Listen, a few days ago, the Russian ambassador came to me with a letter from Brezhnev and Kosygin that was full of threats. You must look at the situation not only through military eyes, rather see the overall situation, observe the advantages of restraint at least until the United States expresses its support of any scenario. But I must say that I leave here encouraged. Better horses that have to be restrained than horses that have to be goaded on. All I ask is a measure of "geduld," a little patience. That's it. Thank you. Thank you, friends. -Thank you. Thank you very much. Alright, gentlemen... Mr. Prime Minister. The country is on the decline. You don't need Dayan or Ben Gurion. Give the order and the IDF will do the job. You'll go down in history. I think I made myself clear. You're making a fatal mistake. Time will tell. Ezer, are you mad? You will calm down and apologize. Adi, let's go. Sweetie, get back to work. And he wants to be chief of staff... He will never be a chief of staff. May 30, 1967 King Hussein signs a military treaty with Egypt. In Israel, the concerns intensify and with them the pressure on Eshkol to appoint Dayan defense minister. May 31, 1967 Meeting between Levi Eshkol and representatives of the Labor party Well well, all the big guns of the party are here. Friends, I'll let you in on a secret. I sent Mossad Director Meir Amit to meet with the heads of the Pentagon and the CIA. They respect Meir very much. I hope that he'll return with good news. The National Religious Party threatens to break up the coalition if Dayan isn't appointed defense minister. What? -Mr. Prime Minister, I'm not sure Amit will do better than Eban. The Americans are busy with Vietnam, we don't interest them. "Herut" and the Liberals condition their joining the national unity government upon Dayan being appointed defense minister. I don't understand. A few days ago you objected to Dayan's appointment. What happened? There is discontent in the party branches, not to mention among the people. The pressure on us is escalating. You have not an ounce of steel with which to defend your comrade. Nasser did one good thing for me. What? Thanks to him... I discover the true faces of the people who are supposed to be my true friends. Levi, if you don't appoint Dayan defense minister, history will not hold you in high regard. Thank you. It's either me, Levi Eshkol, or Moshe Dayan. One was born in a small village outside Kiev, the other was born in Israel and raised in Nahalal. When they look at me, they see what they want to run away from. When they look at him, they see what they want to be. Maybe I should just give in. Sometimes when you let go of something, you achieve more than if you stick to it. You're giving up too quickly. Where is the Eshkol that I knew? The one that stood up to Ben Gurion and didn't let him sway him. Ben Gurion is not the issue. Judiciary committee or not, the whole party was with me. We're talking about the fate of the country and I'm alone. You're the first prime minister that was invited to the White House. Even Ben Gurion wasn't invited to the White House. You're the first who procured weapons from the Americans. You built the army. So now you'll give in to Dayan so that he'll get the credit and the appreciation that you deserve? That's the way of the world. Some do the dirty work and some take the credit. If you give in to him, you'll be making a big mistake. I already made the most important decision in my life, so one mistake won't matter. What decision? You didn't have much choice then, but this time you do. Stand your ground. Threaten to resign. No, that's not a good idea. There are too many people waiting for that. I won't give them the satisfaction. Eshkol? Eshkol, are you here? Eshkol? Prime Minister's office, good morning. Shifra, it's Miriam. May I speak to the prime minister? I'm sorry, the prime minister is in a meeting, he asked not to be disturbed. Can I give him a message? Yes, please tell him that... No, just have him call me when he can. -Of course. I feel as if I'm going to cut my hand off. In chess, sometimes to save the king you have to sacrifice the queen. The queen is the defense ministry and the king is the prime ministership. -Exactly. It's a risky move, but sometimes it must be done. He's here. -Have him come in. Mr. Prime Minister, you did a noble deed. History will admire you for this. That we shall see. Either I'll be admired or be called the village idiot. I prepared a document that defines our authorities. Any decision about going to war or any military campaign requires my approval. I agree, I didn't think otherwise. Mr. Prime Minister, good luck to us both and to the people of Israel. Good luck. Moshe, tell me, when you patrolled the front, were you planning this move then? Mr. Prime Minister, good luck to us all. It's your wife, can you take the call? Put her through. I tried to reach you. I wanted to support you regarding Dayan. You mean the new defense minister. You mean you gave in? Miriam, it's not between me or him. It's between me and the people. The people wanted Dayan, the people got Dayan. I said to myself, history, do as you please and do it quick. I hope you know what you're doing. Good bye, Miriam. Well? How am I as a chess player? At a time of crisis and trial, a national unity government came into being that included almost all the parties. Gentlemen, gentlemen. Gentlemen, Begin. (Government session June 3-4, 1967) I apologize for the late hour, but the matter can't be delayed. Let's get down to business, we'll hear Meir's report having returned from the United States. Meir. Maj. Gen. Meir Amit Mossad director Mr. Prime Minister, esteemed ministers, as you know, I met with the director of the CIA, Richard Helms, with Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara... What about Johnson? I didn't meet him, but he knew I was meeting McNamara. After speaking to all these people, we cannot count on the Americans at this point. They won't organize an armada, (to break through the Straits) but they won't mourn if we take the initiative into our hands. Maximum we wait one week until a ship of ours sails the Straits. If it is stopped, we will launch the campaign. Meir, I'm surprised at you. Once we sail a ship through the Straits, the Egyptians will know we intend to attack and will fire the first shot. I want to say one thing, best they denounce us and we live, than we be praised and die. I second that. Gentlemen, I think we all know where we stand. We did our utmost to prevent war. We were all over the world, we met with everyone we possibly can, nothing, "gornisht mit gornisht." We have no choice but to do what no one will do for us. June 5, 1967 07:15 The IAF launches Operation Focus - the opening airstrike on the Arab air forces on the ground and in the air June 5, 1967 07:45 The "Red Sheet" order is given over the radio IDF ground troops launch an offensive Three weeks after the war Ziva, Ilan, forgive me for interrupting, a dignitary is here to visit. Come in. Hello. Hello. Hello. -Hello. I was told, if I want to cheer up, I should visit the wounded. In which sector were you wounded? -Near the police academy. We sustained mortar fire, I was wounded in the stomach and brought here. How do you feel now? -I'm feeling better. Do you need anything? No, nothing. Thank you. The State of Israel exists thanks to men like you. Be strong and of good courage! Thank you. Thank you for coming. Thank you. -Thank you, thank you. Take care of him, and yourselves. -Thank you. Just a minute, Sir. I want to thank you as well. -Me? What did I do? I sat in an office. I'm referring to the waiting period. Only when you realized that there really is no choice did the army get the command. Knowing that we had no choice but to wage this war was our main weapon. It's the reason we won. Thank you, my friend, you warm my heart. Be strong and of good courage! Be well. -Thank you. -All the best. The Man who Tried to Prevent a War Between June 5-10, 1967, Israel defeated the Egyptian, Syrian and Jordanian armies and seized the Sinai, the Golan Heights and Judea and Samaria. On June 19, 1967, the Israeli government proposed a return of the Occupied Territories for peace. The Arab countries answer was provided in August 1967 at the Arab League Conference in Khartoum: No recognition, no peace, no negotiations. The "Three Nos" of Khartoum reinforced the radical camp and the supporters of settlements in Israel's political establishment. Levi Eshkol passed away in 1969. Only after his death was his great contribution to the establishment of the army and the victory in June 1967 recognized. The war claimed from Israel 790 dead soldiers and 2.500 wounded. This film is dedicated to Ilan Ganani and to the other soldiers who fell in the Six Day War
