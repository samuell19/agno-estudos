Just arrange everything. In two hours, Bapak and I will be there. That Japanese guy can only wait for 30 minutes. - He has to catch a flight. - Won't he wait for a deal worth millions? You want to talk to him? I don't speak Japanese. Boy! So which one should I call? Are you insane? She has three big children. Don't you have someone your age? Well, that's love. Love doesn't know age. Check everything. 360 speed! Stop it. Get that thing out of your mind. Which way now? Get off the highway already? Now go to Sudirman street. Just go at 80 kilometers per hour. If I go at 81, nobody will know, right? Epi 20. Hurry! Epi 20, nurse? Epi 20. Ready. Hurry up! You're not going to lose to a teenager, are you? He doesn't even know how to cure acne. - How much did you bet? Was it much? - Don't try to be funny. Why? The cops. There goes my money! Satrio, which one should I call? My name is Boy, and this is my journal. I'm picking up my girlfriend at the airport. Aren't there ATM machines there? Do you think I can pay dozens of millions of my debt through an ATM? At least you are willing to pay. And stop saying English words. I know what "stupid" means, crazy bule! Tell your boss, I will pay him tomorrow. What's new? It's like that in London too, right? Funny. A traffic jam at this hour? Don't be like that, dear. You speak Indonesian now? Yes. I socialize with people. How's my mom? Since she was admitted here, this journal has always been in her hand. THE RADIO DJ PROBABLY NEVER LEARNED IN SCHOOL... But I have to find this man. Raden Aryo Purbo Joyodiningrat. So. What about you? Well, you know. It's not that easy. I've been in London for over 20 years and then had to move here. My parents got divorced. If not, who knows? Maybe I would've had a sibling. He or she could have handled my dad's work. Your dad is Indonesian too. Bastard! Come out, you! Stop! Let him go! I will pay you tomorrow! Take that! You don't know who my father is? Your father is dead! You jerk! Enough. Take his car. My bag! My luggage! You and your old habit! Borrowing money! Gambling! Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you. Satrio! Come on! Andi! It's you who should deal with Satrio and the police. Why Putri? You're a man. I know how to talk to women. I don't know how to talk to the police. They speak a different language. You enjoy coming in and out of the police station? How can I not? There's a big spacious room, a lot of friends, and free meals. And I've got my own personal bodyguards. Bullshit. Just say that you don't have the guts. - Beautiful. - You mean that battered white guy? Last time I checked, I'm still attracted to women, you know? It's true. - Good evening. Please sit down. - I'm 100% a man. Three men beat me up. Did you know? Too much denial will cut your age in half. Your breath stinks like a dead body. I can recite "Ayat Qursi" and then you'll be sorry. Do you even memorize it? Hold on a second. Dad was granted clemency. The prosecution witness has now admitted the money was not that much. Big or small, what's the difference? At least go and visit him! Look at you. What's the difference between Dad and you? At the end of the day, you two ended up in the same place. Let's prove it. - How is it? - Putri is taking care of it. Why not you, Andi? - Good. Tell him. - Why not you? You're a man too. You should take care of this kind of thing. You expect me to handle this too? I can't handle everything. I do the bookkeeping. Now, it's your turn. - I bought you the book that you wanted. - I can buy it myself. But if you do, when can you see me? How is it, Putri? No problem. It's just like my routine now. - You're sad? - Andi. - Andi. - Scoot over. Sit here, Putri. Jacket. Watch. Wallet. You need to learn your lesson. Get the key tomorrow. Sign here. I don't want to see you here anymore. Don't do this again. Yes, sir. Officer. What about me? Who is that guy? - That guy? - Yes. He's my boyfriend. It will take a while. You should just go home. May I see my boyfriend first? Just for a minute. He's making the report. You can meet him at home. Okay? Listen. My wallet is in my bag. My bag is in the car, and the car is stolen. I don't have money. How can I go home? I can take you home. I'm not a criminal. I'm just a car racer. You'll be safe. Right, Officer? As long as you don't speed. You'll be safe. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. This is... - Tasha. - Tasha. That's Nina, the boss of the auto repair shop, and that's Putri, my sister. And they're Herry and Andi, my friends. They also work for Nina. - Hello. - Hi. - Tasha doesn't have money to go home. - Poor Tasha. - We'll take her home, okay? - We have to. Let's go. Don't stay too long in the police station or you will feel like it's home. Come on. Andi, stop it. Behave. Whatever. You just got here from London? What did they take? Everything. Luggage, purse, laptop. Also my design portfolio. - You get off. It's too cramped here. - How dare you?! Design? What do you design? I design clothes. - You design clothes? - Yes. - Seriously? - Yes. Me too. I designed clothes when I was in Bandung. Andi. That's T-shirt screen printing. He's not a designer. He's silly. Just ignore him. Don't speak like that. It doesn't suit you. I'm not famous. I'm still trying. And your boyfriend, is he a designer too? Very funny. No, he's not. Satrio, I have to pee. Why didn't you go at the police station? - I really have to go. - Can't you hold it? - Or I'll just do it here! - No! Do it! Do it! Do it here, Nina. I will do it here. Hurry up. Andi, move. I have to go. - Hurry up, Nina. - Andi! Yes. Wait here. - What are you doing? - Accompanying you. Don't look. - You're not going with them? - It's not hygienic here. How should I clean myself up after? Smear your hand on the wall. - Of course they have water. - I didn't bring my soap. What book is that? This book? A diary. But this is the 21st century. This diary is not mine. But if it was mine, so what? Someone who writes a diary is someone who can't communicate with other people. Just like Raden Ajeng Kartini. But there are certain things you feel that you can't communicate to others. Really? Just go on Twitter. You can share everything on your mind with others. But not everybody can do that. Yeah, you're right. I'm just surprised. I thought a Londoner would be more open-minded. She's mad. You're really annoying. Quick, say sorry. You've known me for less than an hour. But you dare to insult me? Sorry. I didn't mean to. They've only just met, but he's already asked about her boyfriend. That's your best friend. Flirty. He is. You're annoyed, are you? You should date me. I'm humble. Humble your ass! I can accept that. Beautiful, why are you outside? Let's get in. You might get cold. Come on. I'll get the door for you. It's all right. Come on. I told you, I didn't mean to. Come on, get in. It's all right. Go ahead. It was warm like an oven here. But now it's cold like a fridge. - I get off here. Thank you. - Bye. Today, my mom almost died and she never let go of this diary. So, what's not important to you might be important to others. Making girls happy, that's my specialty. But at making girls annoyed, you're the champion. You're mocking me? I want to have a wet dream tonight! Whatever. We're going to review the bookkeeping. Goats might be attracted to you. But girls will faint! - Faint in my arms. - Yes, you and a goat! What are you doing here? I want to get some coffee. We only have tea. I don't drink coffee. Me too. So what do you actually want? I want to apologize. I shouldn't have behaved the way I did last night. Yes. Apology accepted. And thanks for taking me home last night. - Now what? - I'd like to ask you out for breakfast. I can't. I have to go somewhere. I will take you. Ten minutes? Wait. So, Raden Aryo Purbo Joyodiningrat is your mother's boyfriend? - Yes. - And you know that from this diary? Yes. Tasha, you know it's not right to read someone's diary, don't you? Satrio, this is an emergency. And it's for the best. How much have you read so far? I've finished it. It's the story of the '80s. But interesting. - Really? - Yes. Like what? "I was so happy I could ride my bike with Nuke." "Maybe that was one of the best moments of my life." "Do you know where I took her? Puncak Pas." I'm afraid I won't be able to hold back my laughter when I meet him. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. - You want to see Mr. Aryo? - Yes. He's out of town now. Gosh. Why didn't you tell us earlier? I was at a meeting. This is really important. But he's not here. What can I do? When will he come back? In three days. Can you put us on his schedule? - And may I know who are you? - Just tell him Mrs. Nuke. He will know. All right. I will tell him. - Okay. Thank you. - You're welcome. Boy is here. But he doesn't want to see us. - How do you know? - Just intuition. Do you mind if I borrow this book? Maybe I can get some inspiration from it. Attention, Mr. Junaedi... I forgot to let Niko know. I just went to Boy's office, but he wasn't there. - And you couldn't call? - You know I lost my phone. Who are you? I was at the police station last night. I met Tasha and I took her home. Sorry. It's my fault. What are you doing here? I'm with Tasha. You're not supposed to be here. She didn't tell me to leave. That means she wants me here. Why don't you just leave? Before you regret it. We have to meet Boy immediately. Try this. You should help Satrio. I'm afraid Nina will fire her. - Why? - Nina has been nagging all day. Nina's mad at Satrio? "Satrio, if you want a day off, just say. Let Andi take care of everything." Satrio is a limited edition. I am more convinced now. Nina's real name is Nino. - She's actually a man in a woman's body. - But the body is good. Why didn't you just tell her if you like her? Look at my appearance. You're right. You look fake. I'm not that bad! You're dreaming. This is all because we took that girl home. I didn't like that idea. They are both good-looking women. I'd be confused too if I were Satrio. As long as it's a girl, you would be attracted. Even if it was an old granny. Wrong. I'd prefer a female goat. Andi, do not litter. Pick it up! Can you stop blabbering? Look. If she punishes him, I'll be downgraded to a lower-class man. - I'm a good-looking man! - Silly! Herry! Andi! - I have a job for you two. - What? To find someone. You keep giving us work, but you never pay us. Give me the tools. - You haven't checked this car? - No. - Satrio! - Yes? What are you doing here? If you want to have your car fixed, you can pay later. Stay away from Natasha. Your money and your family's money can't buy me. Pick it up! Pick it up! You don't know who you're talking to. Whose money is that, Satrio? Nobody's! Devil's money! Dirty money! Praise be to God. Hey! Do you want money? Absolutely. Pick it up! BOY WITHDREW FROM INVESTMENT PLANNING OF MALLS AND HOTELS IN MANADO "By filling in the shores, we're snatching the livelihood of fishermen. So I refuse to invest. Their lives are more important." He's a very noble man. We're not looking for him. We won't be able to meet him. So? I read his diary. There is one friend that he kept mentioning there. - What's his name? - Emon. - Come on. Seriously. What's his name? - Emon. - His real name. - Eko Mondial. He's such a popular guy. What does he look like now? - He looks like you. - What do you mean? What are you doing, Satrio? Helping Tasha to find someone. Yes, I know. Andi told me. I mean, what are you doing? Now, I'm confused as to how to answer this question. I just told you the answer. You just met her and you want to help her? I feel bad for her. She doesn't have friends here yet. You don't want to help her. You just love the competition, am I right? What competition? Satrio, you just love looking for trouble. When everybody is involved, then everybody will be in trouble too. Ibu Nina, I'm only helping Tasha. Her mom is seriously ill. Somehow she thinks that if her mom can meet this man named Boy, her mom can get better. That's all. There won't be any problem. Scroll down. What's that? - Hey. - Crap. Andi. - You're so mischievous. - Scroll down. Try and search for "love." Do you think Tasha's picture will show up? Smile, please. What should I do to make you listen to me? Or do I need to kiss you? Kiss her. I'm going to kiss you, okay? Nina, I will use the tongue. I will use the tongue. See? You want to be kissed. Only on the cheek? - Herry can kiss you on the lips. - No way. I can cut your pay. Stop browsing online. Do the bookkeeping. Go. How nice it is to be tall and handsome. I am richer. I am more macho. I am more stylish. I'm definitely cooler. You are becoming iron. What are you becoming? Iron! The impurity weakens you. Impurity weakens you. The more you are forged, the more solid you will become! - You will become more what? - Solid! Tell the people next to you, what are you becoming? Solid! The impurity will leave you. You will become strong! You will become pure! And you will turn into steel! Make it the motto of your life! You are a genius, Mr. Eko! THE SAME GOES FOR LIFE. EVERYTHING HAS TO BE SEWN TOGETHER... We actually came here to find Boy. We would like to give this book to him and reunite him with Tasha's mother. Maybe you can help us? Boy is not the same as he used to be. When the accident that took the lives of his family happened, his business became his whole world. He never had the courage to have a personal life. He has the power, but he's powerless. Can you do me a favor and call him? I don't have his number. And even if I did, he wouldn't answer my call. Here's my number. Maybe you can call me if you hear from him. Here. - Yes. - Thank you. - Mr. Eko. - Yes? My name is Andi. Can you spend a little of your precious time to take a picture together? - Sure. - Great. Nina! Picture. Closer. Take our picture with your phone. One second. Just a picture. Yes. One, two... Just relax. If Eko can't help, we can ask for help from Boy's other friends. It's not that. Then what? Emon. He seems different from the Emon that's written about in the diary. How is he in the diary? What do you mean? And why are you laughing? You're weird. You work in a car repair shop but you love fashion. His designs are good too. Do you really love fashion? Why don't you focus on it? - And you? Why do you love fashion? - It's up to her, Satrio. Weird. No. It's all right. This is silly. No. I mean, I love cars. I love the adrenaline rush when I hit the gas. The same thing with Nina. She was even born in a car. That's why she only dates cars. Actually, she wants to date more than cars. Sorry, Natasha. - She wants to date me. - You wish! You better shut up. Look at that. Isn't that good? - You mean the woman? - Very good. Of course not. I mean her outfit. Everything starts with the fabric. The fabric will be cut, torn, shredded, and will transform into one beautiful piece. The same goes for life. Everything has to be sewn together. Family. Future. Best friends. In the beginning, they were all separate. If we can sew them nicely, we will get a beautiful result. - I think I need a stronger drink. - I told you, it's silly. - No, no. It's not silly. - It's not silly. Nina has the tendency to laugh at the wrong time. - It's all right. Never mind. - Hi, baby. Oh, right. I asked Niko to come here. Is it all right? It's all right. Here. I've taken care of everything. Your luggage is at your house. This is what's most important to me. May I see that? You want to see this? Go ahead. - I need to go to the men's room. - What for? Touch up? Are you following me? Are you curious to see? How much are you willing to pay? I was wrong when I thought you could be bought. Yes, you were. But I would appreciate it... if you didn't tell Tasha about it. Don't worry. Blabbering is not my style. But I still don't want you to see her again. That, I can't promise you. If that's the case, I have to tell you... But I already won. See? I'm finished first. We were just talking about work. They all work in Nina's car repair shop. Oh, yeah. The auto repair shop. What do these three guys do in your garage? Andi and Satrio handle the machines and cars. Herry handles the cash. I bet your auto repair shop is busy and big. They want to work there? From what I see, they're all the modern type of men. Not the type of men who work manual labor jobs. Your garage must be cool too. The garage is definitely a cool one. But garages everywhere are the same. Get under the car. Get smeared with oil. - From his father. - His father. Hey, you're the one who started it. Why didn't you decide whose was bigger when you were in the men's room? No need to argue here. Mine is bigger, that's for sure. Tasha. - Crazy. He's a lunatic. - Drama king. What are you doing early in the morning like this? It's been a while since I cooked for you. Are we good? I should've studied medicine. Been a gynecologist. Then I'd be dealing with women instead of cars. If you dealt with women every day, you would lose interest in them. You want to touch me? - You want me to touch you with a wrench? - No. You would make it crooked. Herry! Please take this black car to its owner. He can't come to pick it up. Will someone come and follow me? Follow you for what? If not, how will I get back? Take a taxi. Do I really have to take a taxi? Dumb and Dumber, can't one of them come with me? What are they doing under the car like that? To turn you on, seeing men smeared with oil under a car. How dare you? Gossiping like girls, huh? Finish it by afternoon, okay? Yes, ma'am. That woman is available, but you're not interested? She's like a couch. Comfortable. I can't make her a girlfriend. And Tasha is like a body pillow. She can be hugged, but can't hug you back. Shit! You idiot. Smooth, Satrio. Oh my gosh! Satrio! - Herry was attacked on the street. - What did they do to him? They didn't do anything to him, but they destroyed the car. Who did that? We, the four of us, don't have enemies. Especially not Herry. Who do you think did that? You two get Herry. - Where are you going? - I will take care of it. I'd like to open a restaurant. I will cook myself. I can open a boutique next to the restaurant. Satrio, what's up? I want to ask you something. Where's Niko? He's inside. Why? Satrio! Wait! What's going on? If you've got a problem with me, finish it with me. Leave my friends alone. Don't act stupid. Satrio, what's actually going on? Niko's been here since this morning. I know he has been here. But he sent men to destroy a car from the garage that Herry took. Satrio! Wait! You and I, out now. What proof do you have to accuse me like this? Satrio, I've known him for ages. He's not like that. Do you have any proof? Is Herry all right? We'd better go inside and talk about it like civilized people. I have to go. His body was so huge. My heart stopped. I said to myself "I will die. I am going to die this time." I wanted to scream but no one would hear. The windows were closed. If I opened the window, I was afraid he would pull me out. I was so scared to death. God! How is it, Satrio? - Are you okay? - Luckily, I'm fine. But look at my face. Pale as hell. Okay. Next time, don't send the car. I'll do it. That's not the point. You were too flirty with that girl and got us in trouble. That's the point! How damaged is the car? I'll pay for it. The car was insured and the owner was very nice. - If not, how would you pay for that?! - I would find a way. Car racing maybe? Did you ever have a problem with men? What do you mean? - Maybe you broke a man's heart before? - Stupid. - What does it have to do with me? - Why are they fighting? None of my business. - Andi. - I'm not responsible for this. - Help me. - It's your problem. What did you do to the bule? It's not easy. We don't have any proof. What are you doing now? Looking for proof on the internet? No. I'm looking for Boy's other friends. You're still helping her, huh? Stop acting like Nina! Where are you going now? To meet Ina. Still in trouble with Nina, in progress with Natasha, and now you have Ina. Insane. I'm proud of you. I thought I was the player here. Finish what you start. I'm coming with you. I want to finish what I start too. Everybody, let's start. Do you want to join the yoga class? No. We came here to see Mrs. Ina. I am Ina. I would like to join your yoga class. Okay. Please take him to the dressing room. What are you doing? Doing yoga. Keep your body straight. Very good, now put your hands down again. Now, lift your hands up again, and put them down slowly. What is it? I sneaked out of Boim's room many times trying to read this book. But I always failed. I never found this book. Boim was really good at hiding stuff. How did you get this? I got it from Tasha, Nuke's daughter. Nuke? Are you her daughter's boyfriend? No. I'm her friend. Maybe you can persuade Boy to see Nuke? I've not seen him in ages. Last time I met him was last year, and it was just a coincidence. How come? Well, people change. Some people became brighter, some became darker. Have you read this diary? No, I haven't. And exhale, down. Lift your hands up again. Read it. If you want to know how to meet Boim, you have to read it. Maybe you can just tell me how can I meet him? I told you, I haven't read it. Excuse me, I have to go back to my yoga. Just leave your number. I will call you. Lift up both arms. What are you doing? Keep doing it. Inhale, up. "The days spent with Nuke felt so perfect." "Everything felt so right." "If Nuke is destined to be mine, nothing in the universe can stop us." "But I still have to move on with my life." "I shouldn't be drowned in sorrow." "Emotion has to be balanced with logic." "I have to face my life one day at a time." "Carpe Diem." Satrio, you have a race. Why are you fixing someone else's car? - Take a line. - I have checked it. When I was a kid and my parents had a fight, I loved to hide under the car in my dad's car repair shop. Sometimes I wondered... Why did two people who had nothing in common, who fought almost every day, and who never showed their love to each other, not just separate? My dad never appreciated my mom's job. As a dancer... my mom was amazing. Every time I watched her performances, the audience would be captivated. If my dad hadn't taught me so much about cars, maybe I would have been a dancer too. Why didn't you become one? It's only cars that I can handle. You're lucky, Satrio. You had a happy childhood. Your family gets along. Until one day I found out... my father was corrupt. My mom fell sick and passed away because she couldn't bear the shame anymore. Yeah, I was happy when I was a kid. I could get everything I want. Turns out, it was all from corruption money. Sorry. I didn't mean to. You don't need to say sorry. I have come to the conclusion that no one in our generation has a perfect family. Everything is dysfunctional. I agree. Even to me, I think my real family... is my good friends. Like you, Andi, and Herry. Ciput is now becoming my sister. Sorry, Nina. I can't. I know. It's ready to be picked up? Nina, Permai Surban called. The rim we ordered is ready. Why tell me? Tell the guy who ordered it. You always have a straight face. Like you never have problems. Of I course I have problems. But I'm such an introvert. - You? An introvert? - Nina, I always tell the truth. Nina! You're ruining my mood. See? Your mood is in your hair, not in your heart. But we will go out. Fixing my hair will be a nightmare. Hurry up. You don't want me to go and lie down again. Wait. Satrio's not here. He's in a car race. I didn't come here to see him anyway. - I heard you were attacked by a stranger. - I was attacked by a big, dark man. I thought I was going to die. - But you're all right? - Luckily I'm fine. - Let me get you a drink. - Yes. You're welcome. Am I interrupting something? What's up? Nothing. Actually, I came here to apologize. Maybe my presence has turned a balanced situation into an imbalanced one. What do you mean? We are both women. I'm sure you can feel it. None of my friends live in Jakarta. That's why I'm so happy I can be friends with you all. Nina, I just came here to convince you that I have no ulterior motive other than being your friend. I have known Niko for 11 years and have been dating him for 3 years. So you don't have any reason to feel threatened by me. - Excuse me. - Sure. Enjoy your drink. You're welcome. - I'm sorry, sorry, sorry. - It's all right. - It's all right. Really. - I'm sorry. - Are you going somewhere? - Yes. My friend will perform as a DJ. Come with us. I can't. My mom is in hospital. These things are not available here. Nina. What? Don't even think about it. Nina, this way I would feel like I was going out with a girl, not a lesbian. - Don't you dare! Why don't you wear it? - I am a man, Nina! - You're the one who needs to wear this. - I don't want to! - Stop it. - Wear this lipstick! It will make you pretty! That's now how you do it. Here, let me do it. I will help you, okay? Your mom won't be happy if you're always sad. Come with us. All right. Now, let's do Nina's makeover. Let's do it! We start with lipstick. - Really? - Totally. This is super cool. - Yeah. - Hi. Where is Nina? - What? You're beautiful. - You're very beautiful. Come on. - Pardon? - You're beautiful. - What? - You're beautiful. - You have to see it. - I'll be back. Look who I found. - Putri, right? How are you? - How are you? I'm good. - We met at the police station. - Oh, right. Nina, you're so beautiful. I could hardly recognize you. - Very beautiful. - Here's your drink. - Thank you. - She is so pretty. And this drink is from the guy over there. Oh my gosh! Lovely, you're here too? - Nina's not coming? - Nina? There she is. What's wrong with you? Where is Nina that I know? She's gone! You're here! - Excuse us. - Bye. How's your mom? Mom? She's doing better. Her condition is stable. The doctor also said no need to worry. For giving Nina a makeover. She really needed it. It was Herry's idea. I was just helping. - I've never seen her this happy. - Really? Nina is a really fun girl. She's a very nice boss. I hope everything will be okay. I hope your mom keeps getting better and your relationship with Niko is fine. Niko! Wait! Niko, wait. I want to talk to your boss. Now! The key. Nina. Come on. I'm fine. Give me the key. This is my car anyway. How messy your brother is. He could live comfortably in his mansion with servants. But he prefers to live here. He calls it an illegitimate mansion. He won't set foot in there ever again. Just like you. Illegitimate. Illegitimate but delicious. - You mean like pork? - How dare you? Even the TV's not working. What should we do? - Back door. - There's no back door here. I will call Satrio. Not active! - Call Andi. - He never brings his phone. - Why not? - Nobody ever wants to call him! Herry, they're coming. Her! Hide in the closet, Putri. Run, Putri! Run! Herry! Her! Run! Let me go! Let go! Let him go! Putri! Run! Herry, wake up. Moi! Herry! Putri! Moi, where's Putri? - Andi. - Get up. Get up. Take him to the hospital. Get up. Let's go. We're going to the hospital now. You can go to the dance floor first. I'm sorry. I want some too. Nick. You want a drink too? Now on the line with us... That's his car. The white one. I want to request "Bebas Sendiri" by XiruZ. - Back to DJ-ing. - Poor him. Hey! That's my car! Bro, calm down. You hurt my family! Please don't interfere. You jerk! - You piece of shit! - Jerk! Satrio! Enough! - Satrio. - Take that. Satrio! You might kill him! Let's get out of here! - Tasha. - Damn you. You know my mom is in the hospital, and now you've made my boyfriend have to go too. - Tasha, listen to me first. - Stay out of my life. It's your fault! If you hadn't acted like a smartass, everything wouldn't be like this! - I will fix everything. - Bullshit! How will you do that? Your life is a mess! How can you fix other things? Why does everything have to be about you? Why? Why can't you think of others too? I started this business from zero. Now, because you fell for that miserable girl, everything is ruined. Damn you! Damn! Damn you! Thanks, Nina. Herry, please... I'm sorry. I have to go. Where are you going? Nina was right. If I stay here, I will only put you in danger. You want to run away? Go ahead, do that. You ran away from home before. Now, you want to run away from here. Damn you. I know I was wrong, okay? - I don't need everyone to rub it in. - What do you mean? We don't do that. We are family, Satrio. Family is not always happy. You know that. If you leave this place now, you will leave a bad trail. In a new place, you will do the same. Before you know it, the world will be filled with your bad trail. Everything can be fixed, Satrio. If it's torn, sew it back together. Create something more beautiful. You can do it. You're a tough guy. If I liked men, I would've asked you out. Even if you don't like me, if you want, someday we can do that. Do that with Herry so he will stop being in denial. What's the problem? This auto repair shop? Just sell your car. Call the guys from M Club. They will help you. For the car insurance, I can try and check. She can't stay mad at you. Your face is annoying. But your brain is working. Not the brain. It's the heart. My heart is full of peace. Where's your brother? You can ask him in person. Andi, just stop. Stop talking. Come on. I don't want to do this. Hey. Andi. Andi, I still want to live. Pull it, Satrio. We have the designs. You just pick. Don't worry about the money. Satrio will sell his car. Who made the design? I did it of course. If Andi had done it, he would have used porn images. Nina, that hurts! - You still want to work for me? - Of course. Who else would do the excels for you? So sweet. Poor you. - Herry. - Explain it to her. Everything has to be bright. The toilet has to be clean. - The toilet? - The toilet. And then... You're cute, Andi. Rawr. Are you happy now? I could have just shredded you. So you love pink, Andi? Looks macho on you. I... - I don't want... - Don't be like a scene in a TV series. You don't know what to say so you say sorry instead. That's boring. But this time, I... I just can't stay mad at you too long. And you know that. That's why you take advantage of us. You have a look in your eyes like an adorable cat. But in the end, the cat will scratch you. I'm sorry. What is it now? You started it. Now you have to finish it. Attention, all nurses who are not on duty... Blood pressure? Please, wait outside, miss. We're all busy. But she's my mother! - Doctor, let me stay here. - What is the number? Please help. Excuse me. Which floor is Mr. Boy's office? - And you are? - This is an emergency. I'm sorry but we can't give you that information. Sir! Where are you going? - May I know where you are going? - To see Mr. Boy. - You have an appointment? - Yes. This is... Sir! Sir! - Get out! Get out! - Okay. Get him! Get him! "I start writing this part when I am in..." Where do you think you're going? Come here! Calm down, gentlemen. - Let go. - Hey! - Boim just called me. - Yes? He's going to Japan, and he usually goes to the airport from Inaya Tower. - Is that so? - So maybe you can try to catch him. Thanks. Watch out. Where are you going? The key! Just arrange everything. In two hours, Bapak and I will be there. That Japanese guy can only wait for 30 minutes. - He has to catch a flight. - Won't he wait for a deal worth millions? You want to talk to him? I don't speak Japanese. Boy! "I want to be a husband who will love his wife with all his heart." "I want to be a great father. That's my dream." "And if I can choose, I want to marry Nuke." - Who are you? How did you get that book? - From Tasha. Nuke's daughter. I promised Tasha I would find you to tell you that Nuke is sick. - What illness? Is it serious? - She's in critical condition. You should come and see her yourself. I will take you there now. Just leave the hospital name and the room number with my assistant. Okay? Now, Mr. Boy. Nuke is waiting. I told you. Leave the information with my assistant. There's always a reason not to make a mistake. You're not the man in this book. Satrio. I know everything. Niko told me that he sent people to destroy the auto repair shop. But I failed. Failed what? I couldn't bring Boy here. Of all the names, there is one name that always stays in my heart. The name that always gives me comfort. The name that I will always love with all my heart forever and in any condition. At least once in a lifetime, we have to start something from scratch. I'm not a superhuman and I'm not the best. Maybe that's why. But this is something that I can start from scratch. To write a journal about pieces of life. This is great. I just follow my feelings. But it makes me realize one thing. You can't have everything in this world, no matter how great or how strong you are. I always believe that friends are the family that we choose, and family is the fate that we have to accept. Fortunately, I have a good fate. As well as a nice family, I have friends who became my family too. Satrio. That young man has stolen my attention. With his will and determination, he can make his dreams come true. He can become a role model. He left his comfort zone to start something and finish it. From start to finish. This one is flawless, pretty, and rich. At least when we're in trouble, her family won't be a burden. And she has only one child.
