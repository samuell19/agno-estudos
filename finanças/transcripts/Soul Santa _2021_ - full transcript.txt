This is the story about how once upon a time, my daddy became Santa. And not just any Santa, the greatest Santa of all time. Go, Daddy! Go, go! Are you ready for the traffic light challenge? Are you ready for the traffic light challenge? Yeah. ♪ Let's go Go, go, go, go Vaeh! Go, go! Get me, get me, get me, get me! The light is green, get back in the car! Keep going! Oh, wait! We coming! Oh, Lord! That was fun, Daddy. It's gon' go viral for sure! See, I told you I could get you beaucoup followers. You know I'm the original social media. When I throw a party, they got to call the National Guard to get all the people out of my place. Million dollar business idea, make a repellent that clears the club hella fast when the party's over. Perfect Christmas gift, Daddy! Eh, you know, Christmas is the biggest con of all. Why you always say that? That's gonna land you on the naughty list. Ah, you always gonna be on Santa's nice list. My little miracle baby. No, don't tell the story again. Yep, doctors always told us we couldn't have any kids. But after many years of marriage, out of the blue, we got pregnant. We named you Nevaeh, Heaven spelled backwards. So where are we going today? Uh, Horseyland. You mean the race track. We going to House of Games. You mean the casino? Um, Pockets of Fun. You mean pool hall. And I also know the ballet's the strip club. How did you know that? I never took you there. I've heard you talk about it with your friends. We can go anywhere you wanna go. Yeah, this is Nicky. No, I can't do that today, I'm busy. No, man, I'm b... Fine, just text it to me. Yeah, text it to me. Dog! I gotta, gotta make a stop for my job. After we're done doing that, the whole day is yours. You know the drill. Lock the doors. If anybody approaches the car, blow the horn, and I'll come running. If it's an emergency... Pepper spray in your glove compartment. And most importantly, Don't tell Mommy! Daddy, explain your job again? Well, I guess you can say at my job, I'm the best BS detector out. Not any con that I can't catch. Remember that when you get to become a teenager. Know the rules, lock the door. I'm looking for a Deshaun. I'm his brother. So let me guess, he owes your boss a loan or something like that, and you're here to collect, right? But the thing is, our bro, he's not paying. Ever. Now you come around here again and I'm gonna lock your ass up. Shut up! First of all, your uniform is bogus. And what is this? Your badge is out of date and your gun is not even holstered properly. Pay me my money, Deshaun! Give me my money now! Okay, all right. What the hell you think this is? Get up, Ryker! Come on, man. You can't blame a guy for trying, right? I heard you might stop by, Nicky. Look man, your debt is high, and you're still gambling, bro? You're one to talk! You're shackled to the mob for the money you owe! Okay, at least I'm chipping away at mine. Come on, man! Irish Mike brags on you! He says you see things others can't. Well, tell me, did you see this coming? Daddy! Hey! Officer Rogers with Child Protective Services. We've received reports of your suspicious activity and we've been gathering proof of child abandonment, neglect. Neglect? I'm right here. Collecting gambling debts and illegal activity while your child is under your supervision. Not to mention the open liquor bottles we now see in your car. We have to take custody of your daughter, return her to her mom. Please don't do this. You'll appear before a judge this week where your case will be heard. Please, ma'am, he said he was sorry! Can't you just give him a break, please? We are. We could detain him for illegal debt collection, but that's another department's job. Listen, baby. Daddy did something really bad this time. So you have to go with the lady here. She'll be safe. Don't worry, Daddy! It's almost Christmas. Good things happen at Christmas! Bye! ♪ Oh ♪ Oh ♪ The only gift I want this year ♪ ♪ Is to feel love again, remember that it's real ♪ Mr. Malone, where is everybody? It's like the rapture in here. I like to drink alone. - Oh. - And for you, I'll make an exception. Oh, no thanks. I'm, I'm not staying. I insist. How many times I gotta tell you, call me Mike. Yeah. You know, six months you work for me and I don't know anything about you. Tell me. What do you want to know? You got an old lady? Kids? No and no. Family. Man, there's nothing like it, you know? Yeah, I know. I mean, I can only imagine. Can you imagine that my business, it's like an extended family? You included. Now I don't want to hurt my family, but I will. Debt's gotta be paid. Ow! Patty cake, patty cake, baker's man. I'll whoop your ass as fast as I can! Knock it off! Nicky, did you make the racetrack pickup? No, I'll get it by 5 tomorrow. Mike, remember the Timeless idea I told you about? The business? How could he forget? You always yammering on about that stupid night club. It's an entertainment experience. Okay, what is something that money can't buy? Everybody wants and we never get back? - Time. - Time. So, imagine a place where for a few hours, time stands still. Where the present meets the past and we celebrate life at it's highest level. So you, you smell the roses while you still got the chance, huh? - Exactly. - Let's have a party, yeah. And you said when I was ready, you'd loan me the money. So I, I have the business plan, I have location, all I need is the $100,000. Oh, Nicky! I like you! You're my best collector, but you don't exactly inspire a lot of confidence. So, uh, sorry. No. - Hey, baby! - Hi! Nicky, you're late as usual. No, we're not due in court 'til 10. Nine o'clock. We called you, and your cell went straight to voicemail. Forgot to put it on the charger, it went dead. Sweetheart, Daddy and Mommy need to have a talk. I feel for you, Daddy! When Mommy's neck starts rolling and eyes start blinking, stop, drop, tuck, and roll! It's your only escape. Little girl, this is grown folk's business. Go over there and have a seat. I left work in Connecticut to come over here during our busiest season to deal with this mess. Liz, I was set up. Par for the course and your so-called job. Courts have already ruled. Look, it's a restraining order, barring you from seeing Nevaeh if I sign. Ain't no piece of paper 'bout to keep me from seeing my kid. If you fight it, they could bring charges up against you, which could lead to jail time. - They reviewing this in 90 days. - 90 days? What about Christmas? Liz, you not gon' sign this, are you? Under normal circumstances, I wouldn't. But, Nicky, your behavior. You gambling and smoking and drinking. Your job. It's too much. I, I, I just need a few days to wrap my mind around this, okay? Come on, Nevaeh. Sorry. Million dollar business idea, find the cure for sadness, package it, and sell the hell out of it. So call Irish Mike, all right? Get you a fake union job, court'll think it's real. No, I don't want Irish Mike and his goons to know nothing about Liz and Nevaeh. Oh, before I forget. Here's Irish Mike's drop, 48,000. To Irish Mike, it's 50,000 a week here. He can't loan me 100,000? I gotta admit, I admire his hustle. He had the guts to go get what he want. That's what I'm gonna start doing. Listen, how much money you got? Four yards. I won a little bet earlier. Give it, give it here. Give it, give it, come on! Call your guy down at the racetrack, let him know it's an emergency. Tell him I need a, I need a long shot. Let him know it's gonna be 10% for the win. Willie, it's Joe. Hey, I need a winner and it's gotta be a lock. 10%, and I'll forget what you owe me. And it needs to be in... White Lightning. It's gotta be a lock! Life and death! There you go. Joey, if we gonna do this, it's gonna need to be big! If, if, if I'm gonna pay back Mike, open up my club Timeless, and be with Nevaeh for Christmas, this has gotta be huge. If you're thinking what I think you're thinking, stop thinking! No guts, no glory! Believe me when I tell you, man, gambling with mob money is certifiable! I can't be without my Nevaeh. I can't do that. It's like living without water. And I'm more afraid of that then Irish Mike any day. Gimme another one. Need it... on White Lightning. Is there a problem? White Lightning! Yes, come on, White lady! Come on, baby! No, no, come on, come on, come on! No, come on, come on, come on, come on! Oh... Oh God, no. Oh. Okay, okay, look, no, no. This, this, this is not a death sentence. This is $48,000, okay? - They're gonna kill you. - No, no, no. Nicky, Nicky, you gotta go, man! - No. - Mexico, Canada. You gotta go, man. You gotta, gotta go. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm, I'm his best collector, I'm good. H-h-he's not gonna kill me. No, I'm good, I'm good. That won't work. Mr. Malone, Mike, Mike. I was drunk and I'll do whatever I need to do to make it up to you. - And then Anthony. - Yeah. He hits the number for 10 grand, blows it all on a strip club. Ours I hope, right? Of course, of course! It's ridiculous! You know, 'bout Nicky. What's going on? Eh, Bernice from the casino said he bet a mountain of cash. Didn't click who he was until later. Gambling with our money? - I know. - I mean that's beyond stupid. Yup. Ah, I like Nicky. If he pays us back, he can live. Look, he's not gonna pay you back. The guy drives a old raggedy LeBaron. If you go easy on him, people gonna think you're going soft. Eh, you're right. - I'm too nice. - Yeah. - That's, that's my problem. - You want me to... Nah, just, uh, take him outta commission. Mm, all right. So, Andy's working out okay? Yeah. If he could stop being stupid and try to show off. Well, let's go Canada! Canada, here I come. LeBaron, it's me and you all the way, baby. Come on, no, no no. No, no, no! Come on, no! Don't do this to me now! No! No! God, I can't afford a bus ticket to Canada. Where can I afford a bus ticket to? Hi! Hi, Daddy! Daddy needs your help. I'm playing hide and seek from some New York guys, okay? I love hide and seek, fun! All right! This is your place to stay for now! Hide here. Mommy never comes here. Okay. I gotta get ready for school. See you later. All right. - Love you, thank you. - Love you, too. Bye! - All right. - Let's go. - So. - Let's go! You have a good day. You gonna close the door? - Yeah. - All right. Be careful! Bye. What? I see you, Liz. Stanford done turned Liz into one of the Stepford ex-wives. Okay, that's Liz! I see you! I see you! Ghost mall, zombie mall, dead mall! This mall has been in my family for three generations, I never thought we'd get these labels! Unfortunately, sir, pursuing anchor stores to lure customers in the mall has yet to render results! Well, we can't survive on Mom and Pop shops. Okay, so what are you saying, Mr. Fairchild? We face closure! Unless we can turn this around by New Year's. FYI... We have been in the red for years. Just losing it faster than we can make it. I have been floating this mall on my savings. I have been approached by Firefly Enterprises. The investment firm wants to purchase the mall and turn it into a fulfillment center for their internet shopping company. I don't want to shut down the mall, but I might not have a choice. Well, the good news is, sir, the Christmas season brings a good sale boost. And, we got our good luck charm. We got the most popular Santa in Connecticut. Yes! He is a local treasure and he's been our Santa for decades. Actually, 25 years to be exact. Perfect! Silver anniversary. We can celebrate his years as Santa! Yes! Make this mall a holiday event destination. Fairchild here. Yes. Yes. What? No! Hello? Santa just quit! What? He got an offer to be Santa at Firefly's mall in San Francisco for a lot more money than we could ever afford, we are screwed! All right, I made some calls. These are the available Santas. Here we go. Oh, he won't be driving anyone's sleighs, a DUI waiting to happen, next. Ow. Whoa! This is Christmas... not Halloween. Next. Oh! This is not Chippendale's, next! Oh, okay! One s... Mm-mm. This is going from worse to worst. Ah... I guess it's back to the drawing board. - Said it, Liz. - I tried! Shower. Ooh! Mom, hurry, I'm gonna be late for school! No, no, no, no, no, no, no! - I, I told you... - Please! Just hold on! I have to... Please, don't go in! I forgot my briefcase! - You're not gonna be late! - Mom, stop! Mommy, do not go in! What are you doing here? So you owe how much mob money? $68,000. I already owed him 20. I did hear him say if I paid it back, they'll let me live. So you wanna stay here until you get the money? And they don't know nothing about us? No, Liz. I swear on us, Liz. I mean, I swear, they know nothing. We have Navaeh. We cannot put her in harm's way. A restraining order, now this, Nicky? Excuse me, Mommy, Daddy. I know you think Dad's a bad man, but he teaches me good stuff, too. Like never double down against face card and always split aces. It's not that I need him to be a good influence on me. He needs me to be a good influence on him. We gotta help him. He has no one else. You have to do everything I say and stay outta sight. Yeah. I don't do that anymore. Okay, well, I have to go find a new Santa so I can keep my job. I'll see y'all later. And you've actually worked with reindeer? - Liz... - Yes, yes, real live ones. I want you to meet our new Santa Claus. This is James Evans. He just moved here from the south side of Chicago with his wife, Florida, and three children. He has references from former alderman, Fred C. Davis and community activist, Willona Woods. I'm sure you had a lot of good times in Chicago. Well, hoping to make better ones here. Liz, this Santa Claus is a method actor, so he likes to stay in character at all times. So, in order to help with his mystique, I will keep his information private, and from now on, we will only refer to him as Santa. My bad! Rules for being Santa, "no cursing"? "No stinky eye"? What, "no drinking"? - Hey! - Hey. We hear you only want to be called Santa. What about St. Nicholas, Papa Noel, Father Christmas? None of those. All the greats only go by one name. Sade, Beyoncé, Prince, Santa. I'm Kourtney from the Asian bistro. Hey, Kourtney. Damon, T's Teddy Town. Hey, Damon. So what's your deal, Santa? This is a safe space. Tell us your story. My life is an open book. Uh, North Pole, elves, yada, yada, ya, all that stuff. Whatever. So this whole Santa shtick. You like to role-play, is that it? Oh, is this your fetish? - Like a furry? - Hey, okay! So, um, this mall. This is pretty much like a family, and Kourtney is our one-stop shop for information technology. - Oh, like that! - Mm-hmm. Little Wendy Williams, what's the hot topic on those two? Oh, okay. So Liz and Conrad, or LizCon as we call them, they've been on the brink of an office romance, but the gag is, they haven't sealed the deal yet. Oh. I don't know why Liz is stalling. Conrad is a walking thirst trap, mm! I mean, you're acting like he's supposed to be the next lead on "The Bachelor" or something. Well, he could give me a rose any day, mm. Oh, he's not all that. I'll be back, I gotta go see a man about a reindeer, so. Something's we're gonna have to work on, - but listen, what can we do? - Okay. Hi, Santa. Here for the grindstone? Uh, n-no, I, I, I wanted to ask Liz a question, but I didn't want to disturb her. Oh, well anything you can ask her, you can ask me. Oh. Uh, I wanted to ask her what key she want her hos in. Her ho-ho-hos, 'cause you can do it in soprano, alto, tenor... W-w-well, indulge me. Oh... Ho-ho-ho or you can go ho-ho-ho... No, no, no. It's all about accentuating your hos. - Mm-hmm. - Tease your hos, twirl your hos. Roll your hos. Ho-ho-ho! Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho! Ho-ho-ho-ho! Ho-ho-ho-ho! So, do you like low hos or you want a high ho? Ho-ho-ho! I think lower is better, don't you? - Ho-ho-ho. - Ho-ho-ho. A good low ho is good. Oh, as you can see here on the screen, we were renovating the mall into a open-air mix-use area, okay? - Mm-hmm. - And then, we gonna... I'm sorry. I like, I can't keep my eyes off you. You know this right here, this part right here is what Mr. Fairchild likes most, right here. Okay, I'm sorry. Let me come see you, please. Conrad, I don't know if it's a good time. Nevaeh just got back from her dad. - Her dad? - Yes. The guy you were telling me about. Yeah. What is, is that why you ran off to New York? Not exactly. Listen. I just need you to know that I wanna make you happy. What? Hey, you do something different to your hair? - I like that. - Hey! It's nice, I like it. A compliment from you? Must be the Santa suit. Wow, that's cold. Uh, yep. Santa's Village, part kid zone, part Christmas camp, a place where the kids can play while the parents shop. Really? What is it, condemned or something? Just think, $75 an hour, plus a Christmas bonus, is a way for you to pay back the mob. Go get 'em, Santa. Okay, who first? What you want for Christmas, little girl? No, you... You can hang that up, you ain't getting none of that! What-what's wrong with her? What you doing? It... No, get her, get her! Honey, are you okay? Get her, take her b... Did you just throw up on me? What is this? Ain't this about a... Full disclosure, you're a disaster. I've seen a lot of Santas in my day, and frankly, you're the worst. Okay, you just seen me with one kid. I'm a quick judge of character. It doesn't matter anyway. I don't believe in you. Santa Claus is a patriotical notion. A propaganda tool used for heteronormative dominance. I didn't understand nothing you just said. - None of it. - Erix! Erix! Erix, you're making me late for my mani, pedi, facial, and waxing! What are you doing in Santa's Village? You were supposed to meet me at the food court. I just had a few questions for Mr. Santa over here. You... are.. new... - Santa? - Yeah. How did you get this job? Is it, is it Make A Wish Foundation? It's just, um... I didn't think that our mall Santa would be so... Hot. So tempting. A lot of people say this is Phat Klein. What you think? Our mall used to have standards before we got our Santas off of the discount racks and the FEMA lines! Well, ho-ho-ho to you, too! I'm going to call the manager on you, Santa! I already called him. Ho-ho-ho, Karen! - Yes? - Liz, customers are complaining about the new Santa, okay? We both know what that means. I said he was a stand-in until the real Santa got here, somebody can keep this going 'til Christmas. Let's hope so. Hey, baby. Hi, Daddy. Santa's Village was empty! It was emptier than my wallet. Emptier than the emptiest bowl of emptiness. It was terrible. - It'll pick up, I'm sure of it. - Yeah. You know what Santa's Village needs? We need a milkshake. A milkshake? What flavor? No, not the dessert. The appeal. Look, if... If all the milkshakes bring boys to the yard, we need something to bring all the kids to the village. - Hey, guys, what are you doing? - -Hey. But you're the milkshake, Daddy. You know what? If that's the case, I gotta get into the soul of Santa. I gotta get under the skin. Mommy, since it's my last day of school before the holidays, can I be Santa's helper at the mall? Please, please, please, please? Okay, okay! Now look, no one can know he's your dad! I see some things never change. Yep. Hey, I've been intending to ask you, what is it with all this new age glow up in here? Well, what's wrong with me bettering myself? Uh, you just taking this thing to a whole 'nother level, huh? Well, somebody has to. Did she just come for me? Oh, I have goals, too! Okay, you don't get it. Okay, look. So. Okay, imagine. A virtual reality state-of-the-art facility, where each room has its own pop culture that dates back a century. There's gonna be dancing. Like that. There's gonna be music. Also fashion, we gonna have fashion up in that piece. Oh, at our place, we'll create a nostalgia-induced experience that's gonna be just for you. At Timeless, it's always gonna be your party. You... just look at that. Look at the wiggle. Look at the wiggle, this is at Timeless. This is what happens at Timeless. Okay, okay! All right, okay! Daddy, you never told me how you and Mommy made this Timeless idea! - Oh. - Well... I'm sorry, guys, I have a conference call. You remember the club I told you about in Jersey. That's "Stella's," named after grandma. Yep. God rest her soul. Yep. You know, your mom was the main attraction. Everybody wanted to hear her sing. Mommy sang? She was amazing! But, Daddy's mistakes caused us to lose the club. Yeah, I caused us to lose everything. But I wanna keep my promise to Mommy. Wish I knew more. Nicky drank, gambled, picked up your cash. Other than that, he's a blank. Understood. Here's a donation for your soccer team. I was a kickass goalie back in school. You ever needed a team sponsor, Paddy Kake Chiropractic is available. Nicky, hope you're okay. Why did you tell Nevaeh about Jersey days? We agreed that we wouldn't. Well, I didn't wanna lie to her and tell her anymore... But if you're gonna tell her the truth, tell her the whole truth! Did you tell her how you gambled away our house, - our savings, the nightclub? - Oh. You promised you wouldn't be like your dad. Okay, don't bring up my dad. But when God blessed us with Nevaeh, I had to end this cycle for her, for her sake! I begged you, Nicky. - Oh, you think I... - Oh, yes I did! You don't think I know I messed up? I gave you an ultimatum to change and you didn't! You didn't, Nicky! And you wonder why I don't sing anymore. Wake up, wake up, wake up! You wanna build a bigger audience? You gotta go to bed sooner! Okay, wait a minute, is it six of y'all? What is going on? It's a Santa crash course. Image is everything when you're Santa. Us kids may not remember every gift for Christmas, but we'll never forget our Santa. She peed. You gotta wrap gifts better than Macy's gift wrapping expert. See? Master the jolly laugh, bellybutton rub, and do it in all different languages, hm! Merry Christmas! Feliz Navidad! Buon Natale! Joyeux Noelle! You are now ready to work that mall! Well, thank you, Santa sensei. That's funny. Liz, we gonna rock this Christmas. Rock Christmas? I love that, now that's enthusiasm, Santa. Um, morning Santa, how can I help you? Uh, I just came to check in. So, uh, I hear our little Nevaeh here is gonna be a Santa's helper this year. Yeah, um, Nevaeh is. Uh, uh, well thank you for coming by, Santa. Yeah, anytime. Thank you. Hey, hey, now you make sure you don't break any child labor laws working our little Nevaeh here. You know, I'd like to break my foot off in his little... Um, Nevaeh. Come on, we'll take you to Santa's Village. - Okay. - I'm sure Santa would... No, I can walk you. We haven't caught up anyway since New York. Well, Conrad, you and I have paperwork we need to discuss. I'm sure Santa wouldn't mind taking her, right Santa? Right. Don't mind at all. All right, well, ay, you make sure you knock 'em dead, tiger. Yeah, knock 'em dead. Come on 'fore I bite him. Daddy, you almost broke cover! I know, that's so unlike me! - You've gotta tighten up! - Yeah. Hey, tell me about this dude Conrad. I can't get a read on him, it's just weird. He's pretty cool. Pretty cool? Y'all spend much time together? No, but I think he likes Mommy. Does she like him? Not sure, maybe. Hmm, maybe. Uh, where you going? You passed the crash course. Now it's time to leave the bread crumbs. Come on! Conrad ever been over your house late at night? - Come on, Daddy! - I'm coming! - Work with me! - I'm coming! It's free samples from stores around the mall. Mommy uses these for promo purposes, and we are, too! Okay. What do you you want me to do? Hold this bag so I can put the free samples in there. Okay, free samples, wow! - Yep! - All right! - Ho-ho-ho! - Santa's Village over there! Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas. Come see us at Santa's Village. Merry Christmas, Santa's Village over there! Come see us at Santa's Village. Everybody, see us at Santa's Village for carol, songs, and Santa time! Oh, look, look, kids! Kids! Ay, who wants to write a letter to The North Pole? - Come on! - Come on. Tell me you wouldn't wanna make friends with Santa's elves in the North Pole? I know I do! Yes! Why are they writing? Wouldn't it be easier to text it or DM it? No! Magic happens when you write! It transforms into something real. Okay, here, you guys can take these right on over there. I'm circling back vis-à-vis our last chat. Okay, what is it with the Santa inquisition? Tell me about your life on the North Pole. Okay, have a seat, have a seat. You wanna know about my life? Okay, let me tell you. Everybody wants to be Santa. Do you know that Frosty the Snowman and The Little Drummer Boy tried to take my job? And Scrooge had an affair with Mrs. Claus! Yes! Jingle Bells tried to get me caught up in some "Me Too" scandal, and The Ghost of Christmas Past, Present, and Future all held me at gunpoint, while Dancer, Prancer, Cupid, and Comet all tried to take my sled. And you know who the ringleader was, don't you? Yes, that's right, Rudolph with his shiny nose. And don't get me started what The Nutcracker tried to do to me! Yeah, right! Sure, Santa! No! Oh, no! No, no, no, no! I take it you got that alert. Our mall is getting skewered all over the Internet! Our rating has fallen from a 3.9 to a 1 in one day! Bad-mouthing the business on the Internet is one thing, but a slander campaign, come on, that's something else. And their biggest issue seems to be new Santa! I just need us to break even before the New Year, or, or... Keeping the mall alive just doesn't make sense, and now, we may have to get rid of new Santa. I hate to say it, he's right. Well, I just got a text from my lawyer. They spoke with the review site who agreed that a rate fall that fast goes against any algorithm. Well, even if it's not Santa's fault, we cannot afford to tarnish our brand. Well, with all due respect, sir, what we can't afford is to allow outside forces to control us. If we give into the Internet trolls, the corporate wolves would eat us alive! The reviews should be down in 48 hours. Hey, I support you guys 100%. Thank you. I thought that when I grew up, I would become a gallerist. Artist, bourgeoisie. So what happened? My father passed away. Mall fell on my shoulders, end of story. Well, I had dreams, too. I, I was a lounge singer, if you can believe that. Really? I never would've caught that. Hmm. If you don't mind me asking, sir, h-how did your marriage survive trading dreams for careers? Mines couldn't. Well, it wasn't easy. Got ugly at times, but we had to redefine happiness. Find the beauty in the struggle. - Touchdown, yes! - Yes, yes! We gon' beat them! - Score! - Yes! Ooh, so who's winning, what's the spread? - New York, plus seven points! - All right! Let's go, baby, let's go, baby! Come on, Big Blue, come on, Big Blue! Woo-hoo! Yes! Liz, I know you all enlightened and stuff, but why won't you let us put some real Christmas decorations up? O-or is that gonna mess with your chi? What are you talking about? This house is decorated! Girl, look at that tree! That ain't no real decoration. My tree looks good! Look like a Charlie Brown Christmas. Oh! That thing catch on fire if your spark that. That ain't no real tree. Come on, let us, let us lighten the place up. Come on, let us slay this house, right? We gon' slay this house! - We gon' slay this house! - We gon' slay this house! Woo! We gon' slay this house! Woo! Searched the burroughs, no Nicky. My contact hasn't been able to track the cell phone, either. So what do you wanna do next? Up the bounty to 20k. Okay. What is it with this mall? Low morale, lackluster salesmen, bad advertising. It's a retail apocalypse. - Mm-hmm. - Yeah, I agree, but unfortunately, it's been that way. Well, it don't have to stay that way. I can turn this place around. The Donald may have the art of the deal, but I have the art of the hustle. Well, I'm willing to try anything, 'cause if this mall shuts down, unemployment lines are not a good journey for me. Yeah, but you would have to run any strategic ideas by mall management and... Cuffing season for the almost lovers. Can you feel the heat from here? Woo! Sure, whatever. Let me tell you how the 360 mall reboot plan will work, okay? I'll be back in a sec. I created the plan. I know, I know, and it was a great little plan in theory. But you know, in the real world, you know, theory has to be put into practice. - I'll say. - Yeah. Can I speak with you for a second? - Oh. - Uh, we're having lunch. Can it wait? Just one second. Why are you letting him mansplain you like that? Being all condescending? You wouldn't have never let me get away with that back in the day. It's not back in the day and you don't know him. He is my biggest support in this mall. So mind your business, Nicky! Mind my business? - Everything okay? - Yeah, it's fine. Okay. So yeah, as I, as I w... I have a few mall improvement ideas. That's cute, Santa, but uh, I think mall improvements are a little bit above your pay grade. I was talking to Liz. It's Ms. Cole. And, uh, the next time that I need my time or my meeting needlessly interrupted, I'll be sure to call you. Thanks, Santa. - This m... He don't know... - Would you... Thank you, Santa. Looks like you caught a fade from Prince Conrad. Straight canceled! Listen, Conrad is a butthole in all caps. Everyone here has a nightmare Conrad story. - Mm-hmm. - It's like some type of right of passage or something. Conrad is a whole snack, but he is too extra in all the wrong ways. Oh, you've been summoned, Kourt. That's the third time today he's sent back food! What a idiot! We're a buffet, Conrad, which means we don't cook to order. He's got some nerve! I think Conrad needs a little something extra in his food. Here. There. - Oh, that oughta get it! - Yeah. A little bit more. Oh, okay. Uh, for the homies! Mm! Bon appetit! Ah, merci beaucoup, mon amie! Thank you so much. Ah, magnifique! So uh, where were we? You were just agreeing with my data analysis, but disagreeing at the same time. Before that. You were telling me to trust your opinion, even if I had prior knowledge to the contrary. - Before that. - Conrad! I was telling you how beautiful you are. Well, thanks! Mm-hmm. It's the truth. - Is it better? - Mm-hmm! Much better! Here we go. We got action. What? What is it? You okay? What, what is it? We got a splatter! Oh, my God! Ay, forget about mall management, eh? Forget it! I always knew he was full of shh... Shut your mouth! Santa, teach us the art of the hustle, ASAP. - That part! - Yeah. You ready? Don't matter where you're from, everybody's buying or selling. If you can find out what a person want, they'll buy anything you're selling. Most people base their choices on five emotions. Greed... lust, compassion, vanity and desperation. Customers, they're your marks. Salespeople are your grifters. Co-workers, shields. These are your steps. Step one is debate. Find out what the marks want. Step two is your hook. Attach what they want with what you're selling. Step three is the real. Gain their trust and seal the deal. You got it? Let the con games begin. Hey! - Hey! - Hey. My first paycheck! I asked Mr. Fairchild to pay me in cash and he did. So why are you giving it to me? 'Cause I had a hard time helping you with child support. You never asked. So, I wanted to make it up to you. You should be using this to pay back the mob. Nah, making amends with you is much more important. And it's legitimate cash for a change. You know what? I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll put this toward the free-Nicky-from-the-mob fund. Okay, let me see your 360 mall reboot plan. I heard you talking about it. You really wanna know? I always wanna know what's going on in your head. - Oh, okay. All right, let me show you. Here it is. - Okay. ♪ Hey, jingle bells, jingle bells ♪ - ♪ Jingle all the way - Come on! - Yes! - ♪ Oh, what fun it is to ride ♪ In a one horse open sleigh Go Santa's helpers, yes! Ho-ho-ho-ho! Santa, you are really invigorating these children. What's your secret? Uh, my cousin Lavita Alizé Jenkins works for the school system, and she and her brother, Duracell, are teaching me the ropes. - Your life is so colorful! - Well, you know. ♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells ♪ Jingle all the Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho! ♪ Oh, what fun it is to ride ♪ In a one horse open ♪ sleigh Oh! So why didn't you join us? If I do walk about, it has to be substantive. Like a spiritual soldiering or a morning constitutional. Okay. Daddy, what's wrong? The kids are happy. You're doing great with the mall workers. Using your naughty skills for something nice. Yeah, but Erix makes the Santa's Village look like a jail sentence! If you can teach the mall workers the magic of the hustle, why can't you give some magic to Erix? You know what? You're right, you're right! Erix! Come here! I wanna make you Santa's helper along with Nevaeh. How much does it pay per hour? No pay? Why do you do it, Nevaeh? 'Cause she's a Santa's helper, she volunteers! Yes, but her mom works here. Well, just consider it community service. Can I at least get a certificate to put in my college application folder? Do you have this shirt in a Oxford button-down or polo style? People are talking! There's whispers out there that Nicky robbed me! That I got fleeced by a drunk! Told you! If you don't take this guy out, street's gonna think you're going soft. You forget about taking on a commission, hmm? You tell all the bounties from Vegas to Atlantic City, I want Nicky dead! Dead! Ah, dammit! Got your coat, have a seat. Go ahead, I got it. Okay, okay. No fever. Are you okay? - No, I'm fine. - Oh. - Have, have a seat. - Okay, okay, okay! Parenting is about meeting halfway. So, I made something healthy for you and slap-your-mama-good for me. Okay! All right! I call it Vegan Soul Food. - Oh, okay. - Let's pray. Lord, thank you for the food we're about to receive, in Jesus's name, amen. - Amen. - Amen. So, uh... Dig in. - All right, come on, come on. - What's the surprise? No, keep coming, keep coming, keep coming! - You'll see! - You'll see! Right there, right there! Okay, you'll see in 5... 4... 3... 2... 1... go! Now that's Christmas right there! Take it all in, Liz! Surprise! - You like that, don't you? - Okay! I know exactly what I want Santa to leave me - under this tree! - What's that, baby girl? More than anything, I want Santa to bring me a doll that looks like me! Oh, cool! I know you into this Christmas spirit. Right, right. Only thing we need now. Who's that singing? That's Mommy. Mommy, come back! - Come on! - Okay. Mommy, your voice, it's everything! Well, thank you, sweetheart! Hey, help me finish the tree. Okay, okay. Nicky, Nicky! Nicky! What is it with the women around here to keep waking me up? What is it? Wake up! Oh, this is about me playing the music, right? Yes. Why did you do that? Look, I don't, I don't want you to keep letting my past mistakes keep you from singing. If you never sing again, you'll always be a star in my eye. That's the thing, Nicky. You see potential in everything and everybody else, but not yourself. It's the way I was raised. My daddy didn't see me as a son, he saw me as a con. A kid with my skills, we swindled our way through Jersey like a hot knife through butter. There was a price to pay. My childhood. It's always been off limits talking about your dad. What changed? Being Santa. It brought back so many memories. You know, we had our biggest score during the holiday season. My dad say, "Christmas is the biggest con of all." We were so busy hustling that we never celebrated the holidays. Then my mom, on the other hand, she, she really wanted something different for me. I tried so hard not to be like that man. But here I am. You're not like him. You a dreamer. Not a schemer. Then why do I feel like I've, I've lost so much of myself along the way? I just feel like I've lost me. Say, dude, watch where you going! Ay, man, you got tissue every... Nevermind. I can't believe this! Who would? Huh, I think I seen who did this, but he's gone now! You think you can give a description to mall security? - Yes. - Great! You know, I don't believe in coincidence. Think someone's trying to get us. Yeah, I agree. - Come on, Liz, I got an idea. - Okay. Well, you help Santa, okay? Mr. Fairchild, look, we'll have this place cleaned up so fresh and so clean, just like my Santa suit. - Bless you, Santa. - Mm-hmm. How do you keep your Santa suit so fresh and clean? Oh, I only take my clothes to Jefferson Cleaners. Ran by George and Weezy Jefferson. Must make a note of that. George and Weezy. How do you spell Weezy? Two Es? - Two Es, yes. - Weezy. You know, Santa's on the marquee. The spotlight needs to be on me. But if you put Santa on blast, it might get you spotted by the mob. Yeah, but I've tried the suburban Santa stuff. That's not working for me. My soul's just not in it. If I'm gonna do this, I need to do it my way. Santa... - needs some... - soul! ♪ Hit it Go, Santa! Go, Santa! Go, Santa! Ay! Go, Santa! Go, go, go, go! Come one, come all! See the greatest show in the North Pole! Santa's Village reopens in 24 hours! Come see me! Nicky, this is not a nightclub! I mean, we can't take vandalism and you. Okay, well, uh... About that impromptu Santa show I just saw on the monitors. Sir, let me explain. Yes, please explain the exciting surprise. What? It was a jolt! And a great distraction from the vandalism! And it was all Liz's idea. Oh, well, with ideas like that, you will be getting a promotion as long as the mall stays afloat. I don't know what to say. Oh, Liz is being modest. She already had a plan to revamp Santa's Village, making it the hippest trip in America. Bravo! To you both, but, you, where did you get those moves? Oh, I learned the dance from my homies, Raj, Rerun, Dwayne, and The Fly Girls. "What's Happening" is when I dance, it's all in "Living Color". You are such a visual artist! - Well, that I am! - Hmm! ♪ Uh ♪ God ♪ Haha ♪ Good ♪ Good God ♪ Ah ♪ Yeah Squad goals? Santa squad goals! What does Firefly Enterprise have that we don't have? A dope ass mall. But we have dope people. We have a goldmine right here! Pickings look slim to me, Santa. Well, it's not about pizzazz. Instead of having everybody just sit on Santa's lap, I say we get everybody involved in on the action. I'm gonna do Santa like I seen growing up as a little boy. I'm gonna be Soul Santa! Soul Santa? That's a whole mood! It will be as soon as Erix shares his musical talents with us. What are you talking about, Santa? You play an instrument. How could you possibly know that? 'Cause I'm Santa. Come on! I demand an explanation! I did not approve my son as a Santa's helper! What? Oh, wait a minute! What... Are y'all seeing this? Are, are you seeing this? Yes! Oh, my... You, you don't see it? You are absolutely perfect! Yas! Hunty, yas-uh! You are so quiche! I am? Yes! I mean, yes! I know! And we would be honored if you would share your impeccable style with us. Tell me more!

Nobody can beat... And, uh, on you! I got fire in these hands, baby, fire! But what card do I have... Santa? Ah! No, w-we'll work on that. Throw the bones, throw the bone! Fried chicken and cornbread keep a poor man fed. Yeah. G-good job on that revamp, Santa. Yeah. Daddy shoots outtie, uh! Ooh, okay, okay! Nice, but no seriously, though. You really came through this season. You may have saved the mall, my job, and... Liz's. I better pay attention. You know, miracles happen at Christmas. You know, it's funny you should say that, Santa. 'Cause I think I found a miracle in Liz. She's a great one. Everything I ever ask for. Uh, boat 'em! Okay! Oh! And Nevaeh? She is the sweetest kid, I swear. Ooh! I think I found my family, though, Santa. They're amazing. And her ex? Some kind of degenerate, gambling low-life, I don't know. Somewhere in her heart, I think she's holding out for him, but her mind knows better. Three piece. Hold the biscuit. It's an earthquake! Domino! Hey! Better luck next time! That's my son! Put some stank on it, son, put some stank on it. - Great job! - Oh! - Sure, sure. - Yeah, sure! - Yeah! - Thank you! Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas! - Bye! Thank you, Soul Santa! Thank you, soul brother! Um... You haven't won me over yet, Santa, but this is a moral victory. - We won her over. - Yup! You're Santa now, really Santa. Sure, sure! Ay, yo! Come here! You gotta look at this, it's hilarious! Look at that! Enough fun and games. Raise the hit on Nicky to 40k. Yeah. Uh... What is this called? It's a grounding technique. Focusing on the here and now. Okay. Can we talk about the here and now? Grounding works best in silence, but words can't be therapeutic. Uh... Being here has brought back feelings. Inhale. Exhale. Breathe through it. It's, it's brought back feelings for me that I thought... Self-soothe, be aware. Speak truth. Well, that ends the session. Gotta get ready to meet Conrad. Conrad? Yeah, we're going to dinner. As the young people say now, we're Instagram official! This about a... Conrad. It's okay, Daddy. Don't give up. - Stop lying on Conrad! - Lying? I seen old boy booed up, booed up with the cosmetic chick. Nicky, stop throwing shade on my joy! What? Oh, man! I do not act like my mother! That hurt my feelings. You... You're patronizing me! You're right, I am trying to work on my weight and smile more! I am here looking for something pretty to wear for you! Was that hubby? What's it to you? Mind if I offer my two cents? No. What? What is it? It seems as if hubby treats you like a possession. So to balance it all, you come to the mall and buy all these things. But you're not gonna find what you need. Which is? I don't know, that's for you to answer. But it is something that money can't buy. Well... Hey, hey, Phil. Look what I did. I told you, I'm a stable genius. Get it? Just wheel him in. Good job! We have had some unsettling news. An unknown source has revealed that you have been giving our workers con job training. Et tu, Santa? Say it isn't so. This is a con-spiracy. Did I impart wisdom into the staff? Yes! Have you seen an increase in sales due to it? Yes! Enough said. Uh, he's right. Uh, sales are well, and the products are legitimate, so marketing could be creative. I am not comfortable with this! If it gets out, we could be flagged by the Better Business Bureau. Or worse. But we are so close to breaking even! Just no more cons! Right? No. - No? - Right. Yes. - No. - No meaning yes. - All right. - In a positive way. - Good. - Yes, no. What were you thinking? Conning at my place of business? Well, I was thinking about you. - Me? - Yes, you! Thinking about your job, thinking about this mall! I would do anything for you because I love you. That's what I was trying to say. Nicky, I will always care about you. I didn't say care. I said, I love... No, Nicky! Cannot go down this road again. It's just best that we be friends. - Friends? - Yes. Well, I don't wanna be friends. Yeah, I'll get that back to you. Everything okay out here? It's fine. Yeah, we good. Just having a conversation with my friend. Oh, dear. You never look so worrisome. What, was it the coup d'etat in my office? No, I just got a lot on my mind. You need an outlet. What do you do for fun? I usually cleanse myself in the waters of Lake Minnetonka. Oh. Well that sounds so fun, so fine. You ever feel like you've missed your shot? All the time. Like with our Christmas marketing, we're doing good, but we're missing something to tip the scale. The revamp Santa's Village is doing wonderful! It's growing bigger and bigger every day. What you need to do on Christmas Eve is throw a huge party! Big party! That will give you the audience that you need. Christmas Eve is three days away. Oh, that's plenty of time. It'll be Santa's Village on steroids! - Really? - Yes! This tree is gonna be so pretty! So pretty! Christmas Eve experience. So you want to pimp the house out, Christmas style? It's my turn. Go, go ahead. - Come on, Daddy! - Come on, Nicky! Join the fun! We could do it together. Okay. Christmas Eve experience. Just grab something outta the box. Okay. I'll get a... What if I do a bow? Yes, that sounds good! I'ma put it right in the center right there. Bam! Look at that! The Christmas Eve event is going to be a blowout! So please, check your inboxes because we're integrating all of your products and services into the event that night. Isn't that wonderful? Yeah, I know it is. I know it is. And everything that the customers will see when they come in is going to be for sale. So... Conrad is my man, not yours. What? Here he is! In my bed after we've taken real good care of each other. But the trees and all the good stuff. So we'll have trees and you can have your fragrances. - Mm-hmm! - And, you know, all your lingerie line and everything. Hey! The makeup counter lady with the bad lace front just bumrushed Liz! What? I'll be back. Excuse me. - Conrad! - What's up? Your chick, Tiffany in cosmetics, just approached me and said you slept with her! Come on, Liz, you know that's not true. Don't lie, Conrad! She just showed me pictures of you in the throes of it all. - So? - So? Listen, I don't do drama, okay? So if you want to be with me, you better act like it! Man, I ain't got to deal with this... - Whoa, whoa, whoa! - You better get your hands off of me! Listen, you don't walk away from... - Hey! - Would you let me go? Did I do that? Oh, dear! You saw what he did! He hit me! I'm going to HR, he should be fired! - And you? - Me? You were rough with Liz, horrible! And after today's drama, several women have reported your torrid relations around the mall! E-e-everything that I've done here has been consensual. It will be an internal investigation into all allegations. Investigation? That's right. I'ma ask you one more time! I told you, I don't know a Conrad! Stop lying, he gave you an envelope! I know he gave... I'm keeping this. I'm not saying another word. Oh, you not? Okay, okay, okay! I'll tell you everything, I'll tell you everything. Yeah, no reward. It's the wrong car. Hey! Man, what you doing here? Heard you talked to my connect this morning. You know something about me, now I know something about you. You don't know nothing about me. Ah, you're the deadbeat ex-husband. My tech guy's got your pictures, okay. Nicky Cole. Huh, you've been a naughty boy. Problems on both sides of the law, I see. And the mob's looking for you. - Mm, mm, mm. - I guess it's true. The only kinda con can't catch is another con. What you want? Not our mutual destruction. And how do we prevent that? Well, I don't call the mob, and you help us out. Help you how? Firefly saw your little Santa Claus seg. They want you to host their gala. They're gonna broadcast you around their malls all across the country. Okay, man, you know that's the same night as the Christmas Eve event. If I don't show up, it's gonna be a disaster. Exactly. And you can't warn anyone, but the best part is we pay. Nice to meet you, Nicky Cole. I talked to Willie at the stables. He said he tipped you off the day that Nicky lost all that money. And he also said you're Nicky's Jersey homeboy. You got me, Paddy Kakes. Ah! Come on, man! You lied last time! It won't happen again! Where's Nicky's daughter? Kid's mom took her to Hawaii, man! No. You're lying again! So now, I'm prescribing a musculoskeletal basic procedure. - No, man, no! - Without anesthesia. Oh, damn! Stanford, Connecticut. Don't do this, man. Come on, Paddy Kakes. Well, now I gotta make sure you don't call anybody. No, man! Come on, don't do this, man! Come on! Hurry up, Nicky, and get dressed. - We'll meet you there. - Mm-hmm. - Be on Santa time, not CP time. - I hear you. All right. In my neighborhood, we had a special tradition. - Really? - Yes! We sure did! We always gave the kids one gift on Christmas Eve from Santa. Can we do that tradition? - Yes! - Sure! - Look! - Gotcha! Mommy, Daddy, look what Santa brought me! Just what I wanted! Oh! These fresh dolls are positively perfect! They look just like me! - She does! - Yeah! Okay, you guys better get going. Okay. We'll be waiting for you at Santa's Village! Okay, baby, lady. Bye, Daddy! - Bye-bye. - Great job! Oh! - Okay. - Bye! - Bye-bye! - Bye! Can't wait! Be careful! Where's Santa? He's late. Have you called your dad? Keeps going to voicemail. A no-show Santa will be chaos! I should've sold this mall to Firefly! They decreased their offer. Before long, I'll be belly up! Uh, I made a mistake, I put in the wrong address. I don't need to go to Firefly Mall. Take me to Sunshine Mall, step on it! Ho to the ho-ho-ho-ho-ho! I'm here, I'm here! This is my husband, Bill, and these are his friends from work. They came to see the show. These bags aren't mine. We are buying gifts for the needy. Um, I, I don't usually, um, eat crow, but here goes. I am so sorry I judged you, Santa. Thank you for saving my family. Ho-ho-ho-ho! I still don't believe in Santa Claus, but I do believe in you. Well, I got to get this party started. Ho-ho-ho-ho! Let's get this Santa party started! Y'all ready? Okay! ♪ When I say Christmas, you say Eve ♪ - ♪ Christmas - Eve! - ♪ Christmas - Eve! - ♪ Christmas - Eve! All right, all right! Well, thank you all for coming. It's Christmas Eve, of course. And I want to let you all know that tonight, all of the stores in the mall are gonna be open extra late, just for you, okay? So get ready for a night full of surprises! Are you ready for the surprises? Yes! Speaking of surprises, I have one that's going to be a doozy. Santa is a fake. He's a liar and a crook. His real name is Nicky Cole, ex-husband of Liz Cole. Well, what are his crimes, you ask? Illegal gambling, loansharking, racketeering, and most importantly, swindling each and every one of you here. Even his own wife and daughter. He's a pathetic little conman. Go ahead, Santa. What do you have to say for yourself? Everything you said is true. That's who I was, but that's not who I am anymore. And I used to think Christmas was the biggest con of all. I seen Christmas through all of your eyes. I now see that a mall is more than its stores. It's relationships, it's community. I-it's not the building. It's the people inside that you connect with. It's a place where you can, you can come and find love. Place where you can come and find compassion and understanding. It's a place where you can find the meaning of life. That's timeless, and the person who's really trying to destroy Sunshine Mall is Conrad. That's absurd! No, it's not! Conrad is helping Firefly Enterprises to sabotage the mall... to force Fairchild to cave, and sell this property to them! Corporate spying is a... It's a federal offense! You and Firefly will be hearing from our lawyers! You're fired, get to stepping! Get him out of our mall! Got you! Let's go! Wait, what are you doing? Give me that back! Get your hands off of me! I'm Conrad Biles for God sake! In a world that tries to divide us by technology, it's good to know that we have a place that we can all still come and gather. This is my Christmas wish, save Sunshine Mall! Save Sunshine Mall! Save Sunshine Mall! Save Sunshine Mall! Save Sunshine Mall! Save Sunshine Mall! Save Sunshine Mall! Save Sunshine Mall! Save Sunshine Mall! Save Sunshine Mall! - Save Sunshine Mall! - Let's all give a big hand to our Soul Santa! Thank you, thank you, Santa! Thank you! I enjoyed the Christmas show, Nicky. Too bad you won't see it end. - Look, I'm sorry... - Too late for apologies, Nicky. I'm going to turn you into the new skeleton in my office. Filet-a-Santa style. Mr. Malone, I just need a little time, I'll pay you back. Got the dough? I had an offer for $100,000 but I would've had to sell my soul. Saved your soul as you lose your life, huh? - Get off me! - Santa! Honey, Santa needs our help! Santa! Y'all better let go of Santa right now before I throw hands, and that's on period! Thank you so much for coming, I hope you're enjoying yourselves. Liz, Liz! - E-e-excuse me. Yes? - Good news! I just heard from my accountant. We met our goal, the mall can stay open! Oh! Thank you so much for coming! Thank you so much! Congratulations, but... Before we celebrate, there's something else I need to say. Nicky, what are you doing? I didn't get a chance to apologize to everybody. Especially you two. I just wanna let you know that I apologize for all the hurt and pain that I've caused. Being here with you and everybody else is, is truly a miracle for me.
