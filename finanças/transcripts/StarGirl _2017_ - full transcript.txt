She sounds very much like you Stanley. You should have heard her last night. Pardon. Ehh nothing. I didn't think you had any family left. Where are you from Voyager? [Unpronounceable speech] North Wales. They don't speak much English up there. So her mother asked me to take her in. And get her talking proper like. She thinks she will have a better chance in life if she can talk the Queens. Like me. Your really very tall. Its on account of the air you see. They grow taller because there's less are pressure than down here in the low lands. Every body knows that Misses Brice. Hello mate. Lovely day. What do you want? That meteor shower a few days ago.

Every being is respected. That is simply enlightenment. Here were free to feed any urges. Humans have not yet reached enlightenment. Some have begun down that path I see. Many other have not. We should not have interacted. Why have we then? I find you... But you come here to hunt. I mean kill humans. Yes. You should have been first. You cough a great deal. Even more when I'm stressed. Why do you cough? Farmers lung. Hurts like hell. Breath. I don't suppose they have booze were you come from? I thought so. Mother used to say whisky was an old mans drink.
