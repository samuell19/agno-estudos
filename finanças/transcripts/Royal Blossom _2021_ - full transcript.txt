- This is like heaven! - If we were located in hell. Is the prince allergic to pollen? No, flowers. Well, maybe you should just wait for us outside. Will you please excuse me? Well, I love it. Do you think I can live in here when I grow up? I think you're gonna keep residing in the royal palace. You are destined to be queen one day, Elena. I don't wanna be queen. I don't even like being a princess. I wanna be a flower girl, no, flower lady, just like you. And I'm going to school in America next year. I hear you can be anyone you want there. Well, how would you like your first lesson? See this flower? It's like you. It has outgrown its home. Wanna help me relocate it? Is that a rhetorical question? Feel better, Herbert. You named the flower Herbert? He looks like a Herbert. Let's do some others. I think we should go and locate your brother before he sneezes himself into an oblivion. Come on. Do you mind taking a picture? Ooh, sure. Okay. Hello, Frank, this is Marvin and Elwood, and they're your new neighbors, so I expect you all to get along. More? Really? Daisy, this is Marvin and Elwood. If you bring one in called Audrey II, then I'm outta here. "Little Shop of Horrors" this ain't. I've been meaning to ask you. Is the only reason you befriended me because my name's Daisy? No. I mean it wasn't the only reason. Have you thought about starting a magazine? "Better Homes or Gardens"? - You're in a mood today. - Yeah. I just found out I'm gonna be looking after your inner sanctum while you're away. Your brother Paul called because you're not answering your phone, and your services required, princess. Don't call me that. You know I hate it. Well, your parents, the king and queen of Fenwick called, and they demand your participation on a goodwill tour around Europe. They can't go, so they expect you and your brother to represent the kingdom on a tour of London, Paris, Rome, and to be honest, by that point, I just really stopped listening because I was crying with jealousy. This is gonna be hell. You're kidding. It's gonna be amazing. Like, sounds like heaven. And besides, everybody wants to be a princess. Yeah, be one maybe, but not treated like one. You mean respected, pampered, rich. I personally wouldn't have a problem with any of that. As opposed to being independent, resilient, having dreams, carving your own path in life? Daisy, I grew up watching my mom go to embassy functions, balls, christenings, public events, you name it, just waving and smiling for an hour like a robot, for what? She'd come back home with swollen feet. Okay, so we can just buy you some comfortable shoes. I don't want a life like that. Well, they just sent the itinerary. I have two days to pack. That should be easy because they don't allow gardens and planes. No, but they allow secretaries. - Say what? - I mean assistants. Personal assistant to the royal princess. Interested? Well, I don't have to teach any 2nd graders at the moment. So what do you say to an all-expense, two-month paid trip to Europe? Daisy, please say yes. I cannot be alone with Paul for that long. We will literally kill each other. Okay, but what exactly does a princess's personal secretary do? Assist, advise, basically what you do for me now. I mean, it's much easier than all the volunteer work you pour yourself into. Hey, I like doing those things, and, but I cold get my cousin to look after the plants. He's been looking for a place to stay in New York for like a few months, so. Perfect. So you're in? We're going to London! Paul should be meeting us here. So tell me. What's your brother like? A real stick in the mud, no sense of humor, like below sea level. Come on. Everybody's got a sense of humor. - No, Not Paul. I swear. - No? Okay, when we were kids, my idols were Priscilla Susan Bury, Katherine Esau, Kate Sessions. Sound like funny ladies. They were illustrators, botanists. They won the National Medal of Honor for plant anatomy, aided in the cultivation of trees in San Diego, amazing things. - Like I said, funny. Well, Paul's idols were Queen's Guard outside of Buckingham Palace. Yeah, the ones that just stand there, emotionless, stiff all day, don't react to anyone? Yeah, that's his idea of a good time. That's Paul. So what does he think of you becoming a florist? Oh, about that? My family has no idea. Yeah. They think I've been studying economy and world trade for the last eight years and working on Wall Street. They have no idea about my minor in botany at night. You mean you majored in botany and you minored in economics? Exactly, and you're the only one that knows that, so please, can we keep it that way? Oh Paul, finally. - Elena. - Prince. - Good to see you. - Good to see you. - How are things in America? - Oh, you know. The Dow is up. Yay. - Ah, excellent. Oh, let me introduce you. This is Daisy McPherson, my personal American assistant, advisor, bodyguard, and secretary. Mm-hmm. I'm the complete package all right. She never leaves home without me. Prince Paul Ethrington of Fenwick. Pleased to meet you. Daisy of Detroit. Pleased to meet you. Coffee? Please. Must say I don't envy you. Knowing my sister as I do, you must have your hands full. The stories I could tell you. But not right now, not right now 'cause we have a public appearance, don't we? Oh, we have several. We must be on our best behavior at all times. The king and queen are counting on us. Mom and Dad. You can call them Mom and Dad, Paul. Never in public. Right, leave you here. See you back in the hotel. - Bye. - Ladies. - Okay. What did I tell you? You missed out the handsome part! Oh Daisy, please. Yes, father. Very well. Yes. We've just touched down in London. About a week or so. Good. Yes. How's Mother? What do you think? I think the regal suite suits me very well. Oh, okay. Good. Elena? Father wishes to speak with you. Oh. Hey Dad, how are you? Mom still turning tricks? Magic tricks. That's her hobby. Oh, she quit? Why? What happened to the rabbit? I was half hoping Elena's time in America might've changed her. - I think it has. - Well, not for the better. I don't know how she intends to run the kingdom with that attitude of hers. But aren't you the one that's gonna come king after your dad steps down? I wish. The reign gets passed to the eldest. Elena was born a year before me. Oh. So she's gonna be ruler. Are they kidding me? Can't just throw poppies and lilies and throw a rose in the middle. What kind of an arrangement is this? Pray for Fenwick. No, no, not you, Pop. I said poppies, as in the flower. No, there's nobody here named Tulip or Rose. It's also a flower, but Daisy's here. Yes, my friend. Yes, a real person. What? I was so hoping that she'd outgrow this juvenile obsession with vegetation. She's always been closer to plants than to people. Never really noticed. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Does Elena have many friends in New York? Sure. She hangs out with Frank, Marvin, and Elwood. - Just give me one second. - Elwood? - Mm-hmm. Paul? Hi. - Hi. - Look at these. Mmm. - Hey. - He's my favorite. Here. This is my dad. Talk to my dad. I'm gonna fix this. Oh. Hello, your majesty royal Highness. Yep, this is Daisy. No, no, no. I wasn't named after the flower. My dad used to watch "Dukes of Hazzard." Well, no, I didn't actually watch it myself, but I don't believe that they were from a royal family. Who the heck's Princess Elena? - Your next assignment. - No, no, no, no. I was supposed to be covering the FDT World Bowl this week. You know that. It starts tomorrow. It's not the Superbowl, Adam. Yes, it is, for flowers. You know, top florists from China, Russia, America, Africa, they all come to compete, and it's the first time it's been held in London. So take some pretty pictures and write something about dandelions, but interview Princess Elena. She is the actual person of interest. Oh, not to me she's not. Okay, come on. Tell me who she is. This is a private conversation. Thank you. She's on a goodwill tour of Europe. Just arrived. She's heir to the throne of Fenwick. Fenwick? Never heard of it. Did you just make that up? It's in Eastern Europe, somewhere near Panthrea. Oh, so now you've said, still no idea what you're talking about. Where's Panthrea? Do I look like a geography professor? Yep. Ask her. She's been living in America for the past 18 years. First time in London. People will want to know more. I told ya, I'm done with women, like all women. I imagine princesses, it's gonna be like 10 times worse. You've had one bad experience. And one was all I needed. You know Nina, she snapped me heart in two and then buried it in her abandoned garden. Hopefully one day it'll grow back. In the meantime, while you're a journalist for my magazine, you will do the stories that assign you, and then you can go and digging for dirt for flowers some other time. Fine. Floral Design Tournament first, then the princess. What's the obsession with floral arrangements? Because you know what, flowers don't kick you while you're down. They certainly don't walk out on you after five years. You know, just being around flowers, it can help lift a sour mood, improve a sad disposition, alleviate the symptoms of depression. Should I go on? - No, just go. And when you return, I expect to see those stories on my desk. Oh, bring me some flowers. Why? 'Cause after speaking with you, I am so sad and depressed. Charming. Yeah. Can I get a word with you for second just over here? Just over here. Okay. I shouldn't really be showing you this, but check it out. Oh, I wanna go here. Oh, but you have a really full schedule, a packed planned itinerary. But I have a lunch break now. Let's go. You know your brother is gonna wonder where we've disappeared to. Daisy, we're gonna look at the flowers for an hour and leave, okay? Relax. I know you. Wow. - Afternoon, ladies. - Hi. - Here for the event? - Yes. Is this where we sign in? - Oh, well that depends. Are you with the press, a member of the jury, or competitor? - General public. Well, I'm sorry, but the FTD World Bowl isn't open to the public until next Sunday for the final ceremony when the winner's announced. Oh well. I guess we can't- - I'm competing. Oh. Well in that case, welcome. Follow me. - What are you doing? - Shh! So what country are you representing? The United States. - Oh, great. We heard the American woman got the flu and couldn't make it this year. She did, which is how I was selected so last minute. You see, this is my first floral competition. Ah. Well, good for you. - Thank you. - So what is your name? - My name? - Yeah. You do have one, right? - Yes. My name- If your brother and parents find out- Daisy, Daisy. Daisy. Okay, Daisy what? McPherson. Daisy McPherson. - What? - How fitting, Daisy. Because my name is Violet, so yeah. Us flowers have to stick together, right? It's the only way to make a bouquet. That is true. Now fill out the entry form, and I will send someone right over with your ID badge. Okay. Thank you. Elena, you can't do this. You have commitments, important commitments. Boring commitments. You saw that basket of welcome flowers at the hotel. I bet I can win this thing. - As me? Well, I can't very well be me. You're right about Paul. Designing floral arrangements is not dignified of a royal princess. Been hearing that my entire life from him. This is my chance to really prove to everyone what I can do, what I was born to do, Daisy. Newsflash. You were born to be a queen. Newsflash. I can multitask, and we know that. - 719. - It's 3718. I live there, too. I know the address. Hi. Excuse me. - Badge? - Yes, yes. Do you need my name? Oh, only if you wanna give it. - Adam Birch. - Daisy McPherson. I'm just her friend. My amazing, supportive, and loyal friend. Okay, that's good to know. So. Badge? Yeah, please. I haven't got one yet. Oh, well you should probably go and get one. I know, right? That's kind of why I'm here. Oh. That's why I'm here, so. I'm just along for the ride. Mm-hmm. Okay, I'm getting a little confused. Let's back it up. I'm here for the press. I'm covering the event for "Better Ways" magazine in London. I'm sorry, I thought you worked here. I'm competing. - I thought you worked here. - No. Funny situation, multiple mistaken identities. More than you know. Well, I would love to interview you at some point for the magazine. Oh yeah. Yeah, I'm sure we can arrange that. Why are you looking at me, Daisy? I'm not your secretary. Right, why am I looking at you? No, you're not my secretary or keeper or anything like that. That's weird. No, I'm my own woman. I'm independent. - Good. I mean... What's so funny? Oh, I don't know. Okay. Here you go. - Ah, thank you. Please tell me that you can find me by press pass. Yeah, just inside the main hall. Good. Okay. Nice to meet you both, like I said, and good luck with competition. Thank you. I look forward to seeing you floral designs, Miss McPherson. Oh, well, I look forward to having them seen, Mr. Birch. I've forgotten where she told me to, did you say that main hall? - Yeah. Brilliant. Awkward. Main hall. - Okay. Thank you. - Good luck, Daisy. By the way, what's your social security number? And you better go check on Paul. He's probably freaking out about where I am. What do I tell him? Anything but the truth. Hey, so I came here to tell you that Elena's gone to the London Children's Hospital. - She's where? - London Children's Hospital. She thought it'd be a really nice idea to go and visit the sick kids and, you know, so they could meet a real princess. You know how she loves to spread happiness to the children. Since when? Since she started volunteering at the homeless shelter in New York a few years ago and also working with second graders. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Why would I lie to a prince and like get my head chopped off? Oh no, I wasn't implying that. I'm just, I'm impressed, that's all. Maybe Elena really is changing. I thought we only think she cared about where plants and flowers. You can just nip that thought in the bud. She's into all kinds of things now. Oh. Queenly sorts of things, or? Sure, queenly things. Like there was a food drive she did for the elderly, and another time, she found homes for this litter of 10 kittens and they were just cutest little things. Wow. That's quite something. Welcome to all of our finalists of this year's FDT World Bowl. We are so pleased to be celebrating our 15th Floral Designers Tournament. Each year, we raised the bar. This year, there will be four design tasks to decide the winner. We will begin with harmony in balance, where each of you designers get to show us your happy place with an arrangement of petals. Sounds like a fun challenge. Fun, sure. It's all fun and games until someone gets hurt with the prick of a thorn, the pierced flesh from a cocktail needle. I have been competing in this tournament since the beginning. Believe me, there is nothing fun about them. Not unless you win, which is precisely what I intend to do. Oh. - Andrey Svetkov, representing the great mother country of Russia. And you are? Daisy McPherson, representing the USA, and I actually intend to have fun. I saw you conversing with that journalist over there, charming the registration woman. Nothing gets past me, Miss McPherson. I have eyes and ears everywhere. Oh, so you're like Picasso, like? Don't talk to me about Spaniards. They had never won the Fee DT. - The what? - The Fee DT? - No- - Neither have any Americans - No, I heard that part. - Have never won- Spaniards have never won the Fee DT. - Oh, the FDT? - The Fee DT. They have never won it. Neither have any Americans. - Until now. - Oh, we shall see. We shall see. See, we shall. - Who was that? - Competition. Did you talk to Paul? How angry was he? Don't worry. I covered for you. Who can be angry with the princess who visits children's hospitals, saves kittens, and volunteers at homeless shelters? Those are all things you've done. Yeah, well you're pretending to be me, so I might as well go all the way, right? I think I'm in way over my head here. I mean, these guys take this competition really seriously. Like weirdly seriously. Uh uh. I have seen what you can do with flowers. There's like nobody with a bigger obsession with plants than you. You're like a walking, talking botanical garden on steroids. I think that's the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me. Oh, that's pretty sad. Okay, well. So do you wanna hear tomorrow's royal agenda? No, I want Persian buttercups and roses and lots of them. Miss McPherson. Let me introduce you to my very good friend, Elena Ethrington. Princess Elena? Of Fenwick? So you've heard of me? Yeah. Yeah, your reputation proceeds you. You're quite the talk of London. In fact, I'm supposed to interview you for my magazine. Oh, no, no, no, not me. You should interview Daisy here because she's my assistant, has more time, and is a lot more interesting than me. No, no, no. The princess is just being modest. Well, that's refreshing. This is perfect. How do you even have enough time to work for the royal family and compete in the competition? Hmm? That's a very good question. The princess and I share a very big passion for flowers. - More like an obsession. - A healthy obsession 'cause flowers and plants are so important. I mean, they spread beauty and life wherever they go. You don't have to tell me. I'd take a plant over a person any day. Okay, so can we carry on this conversation like another time? Because I need to speak to Daisy over here about some upcoming appearances. Of course. Well, I look forward to talking with you both. I'm gonna go and - Okay. Stop babbling on. Maybe we could get lunch sometime. Yeah. Yeah, I'd like that. Great, she'd like that. That's a good thing. - Mm-hmm. - Okay. - Okay, see you. - See you. - Bye. - Bye. Elena, you cannot go over and telling people that I am a princess! That just was not part of the deal! I had to tell him something. I couldn't just keep calling you friend. Hello, friend. How's your day today, friend? Oh, that's so great, friend. I would be okay with that because I don't need a name. You could've told him that my parents lacked imagination, kid, doll, sweetie, child, whatever, anything apart from being you. Okay? What's wrong with being me, one. Two, you've always wanted to be a princess. Well, now's your chance. Let's just pause for a reality check. I can't pass for you. Why not? Firstly, I know nothing about being a princess. Okay. Well we can do some research. I'm sure there's some easy 12 steps on how to be a princess or something. Secondly, your brother knows who you are and who I am. Daisy, I'm not asking you to pay me the whole time, just at the Floral Designers Tournament. And Paul, you do not have to worry about Paul. He wouldn't be caught dead in there. Like, he would die in there, so. Everywhere else in London, I'm me and you're you, okay? How are you gonna balance competing in the tournament and all your royal appearances? It's all about harmony and balance, yes. I just want you to know that I don't approve of what you did this morning, running off at the cathedral, but I must say I'm impressed with you. A children's hospitals is great for public relations. I don't know why we didn't have it on the schedule. It's a perfect spot for a photo op. Oh, I actually didn't take any photos there. Oh, Why not? Elena thought it'd be best not to exploit the moment or the children, you know. It was more of a heartfelt personal visit. Mm-hmm. Of course. Whose idea was that? - Daisy. - Oh. Well, seems you've been a very good influence. I'm glad she brought you along. Daisy and I are basically inseparable. Yeah, most days I don't even know where she starts and I end. Well, I for one would never have a problem differentiating between the two of you. Right? I was just telling Elena that. Well, remember we have a busy morning tomorrow, breakfast with the chancellor, then tea at The Shard, lunch at the famous ballroom, and dinner at Buckingham Palace. Stop, stop. We haven't even eaten, and I'm already full. Very well. Excuse me. I have to wash my hands. Ladies. - I think Paul likes you. - Stop being ridiculous! He just mistakenly thinks I can keep you in check. I don't know. He was very friendly. He's like that to everybody. That's his job. Prince Charming, remember? Oh, so you think he's charming? I did not say that. And I saw the way you will looking at that Adam guy, the reporter. I was just covering for you, But he asked you to lunch tomorrow. Hey, you can take him to the ballroom place with Paul. Okay. I get it. It's gonna be tricky, but we're just gonna have to get creative. And according to that schedule Paul's laid out, you're gonna have to learn how to eat all day without getting fat or sick. Or maybe not. Right. Does everyone know what they want to order? Food poisoning? It was terrible. She was up and down all night. She just got to sleep like an hour ago. Oh. Who orders steak and kidney pie and bangers and mash? You know, when in London. Well, I guess I'll have to greet the chancellor on my own. It's probably for the best, you know? You don't want her to be like all over him. No. That would not be good for public relations. Perhaps she'll be feeling better later? - I'll let you know. - Thank you, Daisy. I truly appreciate you. Well, Elena, I hope you make the most out of your sick day. Good luck being me. Good luck being me. Yes, may the best man, person win. Don't try to make any friends. It's useless. Wow. So sad. Contestants, you have three hours to complete your harmony in balance before the judges and myself evaluate. The time starts now! Okay, come on Sidney, Arabella, Penelope. Show 'em what real beauty really is. Miss McPherson. - Hi. - Hey. Do you mind if I observe your work for a little bit? Oh, no. You're just doing your job, right? Well, actually, my job would rather me be interviewing the princess, but I much prefer be covering this event. Oh really? Why? I don't know. People here are so grounded. You know, they're alive because they're passionate about what they do. I'm a big fan of passion. You? Yeah, yeah, especially when the feeling is mutual. I knew I saw that in you. It's what drives every great artist, right? You don't have to play games. They don't have to pretend to be something they're not. You know where you stand. Speaking of standing, you're standing on my greenery, Mr. Birch. Oh, oh. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm gonna let you do what you do, and I'll go over there and be passionate on my own. - Okay. - That sounds weird. Ignore I said that. - See ya. Time's up! A throne of flowers! Yeah, my happiest place in the world are gardens, so I just wanted to kind of create one where I could sit and relax. Hence, harmony and balance for me is the perfect resting place. Excellent work, Miss McPherson. You are off to a wonderful start. Thank you. - Wow. A throne. - Yeah. - That's pretty cool. - Thank you. It looks like hanging out with princesses rubbing off on you. A bit. - Well, I'd love to know more. - About me or the princess? - Both, actually. - Okay. What are you doing for lunch? - Eating. - Makes sense. Would you like some company? - I already have some. - Oh. Because I have a prior engagement with the princess. - I could tag along maybe. - No. - Okay. - Definitely no, but tomorrow, I'm totally free tomorrow for lunch. - Tomorrow works. - Tomorrow. - Okay. Yeah. - Yeah. - It could be just tomorrow. - Tomorrow. We should stop saying tomorrow. Yeah, yeah. Okay, it's a date. It's a work date. - Right. Right. - Right. The winner of the first round is Daisy McPherson. Congratulations! Now tomorrow will be devoted to strength in color and character. - Congratulations. - Thank you! I can't believe it. I have to go, - Yeah. - But I'll see you tomorrow? - Yeah, tomorrow. Oh. - Sorry, I was going for the- - That was so- And now you're doing the... We should... She said she'll be here. You know, you can never predict with stomach flu, so. I thought you said it was food poisoning. Well, Elena thought so this morning, but if she's not here, then... Do you have an earache or something? Oh, no. Hotel security lent me one of their earpieces so I can keep tabs on Elena. Yeah, copy. Just knocked on the door and she's not in her hotel suite. I'm sure she's on her way down. I like punctual people, like you. I like you too, Paul. Oh, no, sorry. I didn't mean, well, at least I wasn't trying to infer- And I wasn't trying to imply that you were inferring or anything. No, that would be a presumptuous. - Absolutely, sorry. - No, of me, not of you. I don't wanna put words in your mouth. No, nor I take words out of yours. Gotcha. There you are. Sorry. I thought we were having lunch at Buckingham Palace today. No, it's dinner at the palace, lunch at the ballroom. Oh, well, that explains it. Fake flowers. Nice touch, Paul. Yes. I'm glad to see you're feeling better. You know, it comes and and it goes. Reminds me of someone. Hmm. So prime rib with the prime minister tonight? No, it was breakfast this morning with the chancellor. He wishes you a speedy recovery. Well, he got what he wished. So what'd I miss? Well, half of your scheduled appearances, but here we are. Oh, I did receive an interview request from "Better Ways" magazine. I set up a time tomorrow at noon. Write it down. Did you get the name of the reporter, by any chance? Yes, Mr. Adam Birch. Oh, I spoke with him briefly, briefly. Did you? When? When I run into him. Where did that occur? - In London. - Yes, I assumed that. She met him at the convention center. Yeah, he's also covering the flower show. Apparently, it's like the biggest one in the world. Isn't that right, Daisy? - Mm-hmm. Elena asked me to go down and check it out for her. Mm-hmm, since I'm obviously way too busy to go myself, obviously. Yes. Well, like I say, I don't envy you. You wouldn't catch me going near that place. Everyone down there is covered in pollen. Probably the journalist as well. Yes. You know, I think you might have to do this interview without me. If I must. Yes, Mom, I did try to participate, but I had very good reason to leave. Didn't Paul tell you that I went to the children's hospital the other day? Well, I'm glad you approve. Thanks, Mom. Okay. Give dad my best. Good night. So how long do you think you can keep this charade up for? Until I win the competition. And what about my interview with Adam tomorrow? Okay. Don't worry. I'll tell him everything he needs to know about the princess over lunch because I'm having lunch with him tomorrow, and I know the princess better than anyone 'cause it's me. Hi. I'm the princess. Ah, but I think he's interested in me. Only 'cause he thinks you're me. I mean, no I'm you. - And you're not. So how are you gonna tell him about my background, my upbringing, my parents? I feel like if you come along, it's just gonna get messy and we won't be able to keep our stories straight. - Yeah. I didn't really wanna go anyway. I know, I know. You'd rather be with Paul. Well, yeah, but there's nothing going on between us, so just forget about it. Okay. Sure. So how am I supposed to learn your whole life story in one night? Do a 12 easy step search on how to be Daisy McPherson. Daisy, I- Have you heard about those devices the security guards wear to communicate with each other? Yeah, I think so. Why? Assignment two, strength in color and character. You have three hours to show us your masterpiece. May the flowers be with you. Always. Carry on. What is going on? Oh, come on. Please don't die on me now. Oh come on. Jacqueline, Becky. You should be keeping your eyes on the winner, Mr. Birch. Time's up. Nice, Miss McPherson, but I was expecting something more special. Yeah, it's really bad. You mean something more like... Good try, Miss McPherson, but this round's winner is Mr. Svetkov. Congratulations. Daisy, despite the outcome, I want you to know I think the flower fan idea was brilliant. Thanks. It was. How'd you come up with it? Well, I was thinking about what's the purpose of the bouquet, right? And their destiny's just to be put on display. So I was thinking about things that people use, and I just thought of a hand fan and I thought, "Why not let the flowers be beautiful" and serve a purpose, you know? "Why can't they do both?" - Why not indeed. - 'Cause it didn't work, and I lost. Yeah, and that was just this round. You're gonna get 'em next time. It's not over yet. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. But it is lunchtime. It is, and about that. My editor is so on my case right now about me interviewing Princess Elena. So I'm gonna have to take a rain check. I'm sorry. I was supposed to meet her at noon, and- I know, but she can't make it. Some royal duties came up and she really apologizes, but she did instruct me to tell you whatever you need to know about her for the article, if, of course that's okay. Yeah, that works for me. - Okay. - Okay. We're back on. - Yeah. Okay, I was gonna go to this restaurant. It's not far from here. I mean, it's a little bit fancy, but the food is really good. Okay, yeah. That sounds perfect. I'm just gonna grab my coat and I'll meet you outside. - Sounds like a plan. - Okay. - What do you think? - This is amazing. Hope this'll do. Quite nicely. Great choice. Thanks. You've obviously found your true calling in life, destined to work with flowers. I've been trying to tell my family that for forever. What, they don't approve? To say the least. What about you? When did your interest in florals begin? It started with a girl. Where else, right? - Yeah. You know, I thought we were in love. I followed her to London, but eventually, she, well, she dumped me, and she walked out. She left her flowers and her plants, all of it, behind. You know, God, I was just this close to chucking it away. Then I thought, "Nope." They're kind of innocent victims, right?" So I started caring for 'em, helped 'em thrive, and in turn, it kind of got me out of my funk. Yes. That's the magic with flowers. I mean, people don't realize how important nature really is. You take care of it, it takes care of you, and I'm not just talking about for the environment. I'm talking about for the soul. It's an air we breathe every day. Right. You know, I've got this crazy, crazy idea about opening my own cutting edge workshop. Yeah, like a florist street design center for gardens and those people interested in creating professional arrangements for all different types of occasions. I don't think it's crazy at all. I think it's a beautiful idea. I'd join in a heartbeat. Then you'd have to stop working for the princess, and how would you juggle both jobs? I know, I know, and that's basically the crux of the entire problem. Let's order some food. Then you can tell me all about yourself, you know, where you're from, what your parents are like. You mean about the princess? No. I wanna hear about you first. Mm-hmm. Yes, okay. I'm gonna have the chicken sandwich and a side salad. Do you mind to tell the waiter if he comes by? I'm just gonna go to the ladies room. Sure. Yes, that's the magic of flowers. - You wanted to see me? - Oh, yes. I wondered if you'd care to join me. - Just the two of us? - I thought why not? We can talk privately about my sister, amongst other things. Testing, testing. Daisy, can you hear me? Yes. Yes, what? Yes. This is lovely, Paul. Thank you for inviting me. You're having lunch with Paul now? Well, thank you for accepting. Daisy, I'm about to have my interview with Adam. You're supposed to help me. And I will try and answer any question you may have. Ah, excellent. Thank you. - I ordered. - Great. - You ready? - As ready as I'll ever be. Okay. Well let me start by saying, I think you're a remarkable woman, Miss McPherson. - Please call me Daisy. So Daisy. Where'd you come from? Well, as I mentioned earlier, I was born in the great state of- Michigan. Really? You don't sound like that. - Then I moved to New- - York. I've been living there for years. And which place do you prefer? Where you met Elena? Yes. You prefer yes? Yes, New York, 'cause that's where I met princess Elena- In college. Ah, that was actually my next question. I guess I just must've read your mind. Elena's in line to become the next queen of Fenwick. So when did your passion for flowers begin, and why does you family disapprove? - And you disapprove? - Oh no, not at all. No. I want Elena to be a responsible queen. Does Elena believe that I don't wish her to be crown? - I did not say that. - I didn't say that. Yeah, you did, earlier. Did I? Sounded like that's what you might be implying. What was the question again? Why does your family disapprove of your career choice in flowers? I just think Elena wants to be seen for who she truly is. That's right. What's right? They want what's right for me. You see, my family has this tradition. Tradition is everything. Elena must take her rightful place and do her duty. We all must. We cannot break with tradition. - I understand. - No, you wouldn't understand. Believe me, I totally understand. My parents wanted me to be a lawyer, you know, certainly not a journalist and definitely not a floral arranger. I need your help. The kingdom's future could depend on it. What do you mean? I mean I'm the same as you. I don't want people to tell me what to do with my life. Fenwick in dire financial restraints at the moment, hence this goodwill tour. We have to bring trade back into the country. Then what you need is a clever marketing idea to put Fenwick back on the map. I majored in business with Elena, and attractions attract. Then that's when money starts rolling in. Hmm. And you're naturally gifted at doing something that you love. You know, I wouldn't let your family, I wouldn't let Princess Elena get in the way of that, you know, with their own selfish demands. That seems pretty harsh. Mr. Birch. I mean, you don't even know my family. You definitely don't know who Princess Elena really is. But you gotta watch what you're saying. Oh, I am, believe me. I don't wanna scare her away, which is why I want you to speak to her. I know you have her ear. - I do? - You do? Mm-hmm. People with power, they're all the same. Royalty is no exception. - Hmm. Come on. I've seen the way she acts around you. I've been watching the two of you. Right. And what our royal princesses like? Controlling, self absorbed, self centered, egotistical. Should I go on? No, you know, I think they put a friendly face on to the general public, but when push comes to shove, the 1% always stick together. Wow. Well, if that's what you think of my best friend, then this interview is over, Mr. Birch. I need to be going, too. Daisy, Daisy, I'm sorry. I just- I didn't wish for Elena to monopolize our entire conversation. I didn't mean any offense by it. I guess being a journalist makes me insensitive sometimes. I have a lot of stuff to do and I should really go and have that talk with Elena. I just call things as I see 'em. Well, you made the wrong call this time, Mr. Birch. Goodbye. Please, there's no immediate rush. I think there is. Goodbye, Paul. Elena. Elena, where are you? I mean, where am I? Sometimes I talk to myself. Okay. - Elena. - Where? I know, I'm sorry. You're gonna keep a low profile. Yeah, that's it. Andrey Svetkov. And don't you worry. Your true identity is safe with me. If there is one thing with Russians can do, it's keep secrets. - My true identity? Yes, we both know who you really are. - She told you? - No, I'm just observant. I study people, learn their habits. My father was with the KG... Well, I cannot say, you understand. Mm-hmm, absolutely. So have you seen Princess Elena? No. - Does that mean you have? - Yes. - So where is she? - I have no idea. Okay, great. You've been really helpful. Thank you. - May I make an observation? - Sure. I do not think it's fitting for a royal family to be involved in a competition so beneath their social stature, nor should they allow one of their employees to be involved in one. After all, actions reflect, sometimes negatively, especially when one is keeping secrets. I'll keep that under advisement. - Princess Elena. - See what I mean? I'm sorry to interrupt. Have you seen Daisy? We were just talking about Miss McPherson. Would you just excuse us for a second? - Oh, sorry. I'll get that. - Thank you. Weren't you supposed to be having lunch with her? Yes, yes we were, but I said something wrong. It was really dumb. I didn't mean anything by it. I just, I wanted to give her some friendly advice, that's all. - Mm-hmm, I heard. Oh, she spoke to you? - Not exactly to me. - Okay. I need you to know that I only have Daisy's best interests at heart, you know? I think she's really talented, and I'd hate to see her take the wrong path. I hear you loud and clear, and we all want what's best for Daisy. It's just a little bit more complicated than you realize. Okay. Actually, when you see her, do me a massive favor. Please tell her that my intentions, there were sincere. You know, I want her to embrace who she is. She seems a little confused. - Aren't we all? - After two rounds, Miss McPherson and Mr. Svetkov have one win each. The third task is entitled season of bloom. In this round, we would like to see personal growth. We will be judging this tomorrow to decide our finalists. You will have one hour to design now and three in the morning to execute. I have to find Daisy. Where have you been? I've been looking for you. I needed some time alone to think. I need to talk to you. But not here. Oh wow. Paul would probably die in here. That's kind of what I needed to talk to you about. - Paul's dying? - No! So he begged me to talk to you along with that reporter, and the really, really creepy Russian dude. Oh, I don't care about them. What happened with Paul? Nothing. He's not interested in me. He's only interested in you. He's afraid that if you don't step up and become queen, then the whole kingdom will be in financial ruin, and that's why this whole tour has been so important. It's to save the economy of Fenwick. I heard, but finances aren't my thing. I mean, I took those business classes, but Paul's always been great with numbers. Well, when it comes to age, there's nothing he can do. You will always be older than him. Stupid first child rule. He really didn't ask about you? - A little bit, yeah. - See? Then he does like you. Paul has no interest in anyone unless he really likes them. And you like him, too. - Yeah, I do, but it's just never gonna happen. Why? Well, he's a prince and I'm a Daisy. My dad watching "Duke of Hazzards" is the closest thing to royal blood is I'll ever get, so your brother marrying a common girl, it's just not gonna happen. Daisy, Daisy, hey. If it makes you feel any better, that's exactly where I stand with Adam. Why, what happened? You heard. Elena, that was the worst four-way conversation I have ever had the displeasure of being a part of. I know, but he insulted me. He has no respect or regard for royals who happen to be my family. He wants nothing to do with me. But he thinks you're me, right? Right, right. He wants you to live your dreams and embrace your talent and open up a floral business and maybe live happily ever after with him. But in order for you to do that, you have to get rid of me. So basically, he's everything you've ever dreamed of in a man? Mm-hmm. Except I can't escape who I am. I should just quit this competition and accept my fate. - You cannot do that. - Why? That's not who you are, and you know it. They announced the last round of the competition. Seasons of bloom. You've gotta create a floral arrangement that showcases your inner truth. Well, now it makes this decision easy. It's over. I've already lost. Why? Because everything about me is a lie, everything. I quit. Elena! Hey, is Daisy or Princess Elena out there? - They have left. - For the day? - Permanently, I believe. - Huh? Princess Elena has finally done the right thing. She has quit the competition. She made Daisy quit. No, no, no, no, no. Daisy is Princess Elena and vice versa. She fooled everyone. She fooled you. She fooled everyone but me, of course. I saw through their little charade. Don't touch me. And now the World Bowl wants to schedule my interview with your magazine, Mr. Birch. Now, excuse me. I have a competition to win. Elena. You said we had an appearance at the opera tonight. Yes. Will you be joining me? I'm ready to serve my kingdom. I won't let you, Mother, or Father down anymore, I promise. Daisy spoke to you. She is an amazing woman. She is, and I know what must be done if I'm going to be queen some day. Well, I believe our car's waiting. Then let's not doddle. Princess. Come on, wake up, princess. We really need to talk. Daisy, I already know what you're gonna say, that I should not abandon my hopes and dreams, right? That I shouldn't quit the competition at this stage and that I should be with Adam cause he's Mr. Right and I should make it work with him. But I'm not gonna do that 'cause for the first time in my life, I'm gonna make my family proud and do my duty, okay? And there is nothing that you can do or say that's gonna change that. Just let me go back to sleep. I actually wasn't gonna anything. I just came to give you some reading material. What is this? "Better Ways" magazine just hit the stands and is online, too. He didn't. - He most certainly did. "My lunch with Princess Elena, the front runner of the FDT World Bowl." Are you serious? Cover blown. - Oh, he's a son- - Hey! Princess. Can you please remember you are a princess? Does Paul know about this? Elena! Elena, are you in there? Elena! I demand a word! I'd probably say he does now. Elena, we have to talk! Get Adam Birch on the phone right now. Oh my God. It's my parents. This is a nightmare. This is a nightmare. This is a nightmare. Elena! Elena, I demand a word! I don't know, Daisy, we're like eight floors up. If I land in the pool, I should be fine, right? No, that's crazy. Is it? I don't know. Oh my God. Okay, I only got through to Adam's voicemail. It says he's out all week covering an event. Oh, an event. Well, I know exactly where that event is, but you need to help me stall Paul. Hey, no, but how am I supposed to stall an angry prince? Daisy, he likes you, okay? He told me so last night. He thinks you're amazing. - He did? - Yes! And you're the only one that can calm him down right now because I can fix this. I can fix all of this. I just need some time, okay? So just do your Daisy thing and just 'cause I need time, 'kay? I think you're amazing too, Paul. Has Elena seen? Mm-hmm. She's on her way to sort it out now. She's just getting dressed first. - Oh. - Mm-hmm. Would you like to have breakfast with me? I'd love that. - Good. - Mm-hmm. Okay. Well, I'll see you later. Mm-hmm. Do you realize what you've done? Well, just, I did the job of any journalist. I uncovered the truth. You ruined the reputation of Fenwick. I barely mentioned Fenwick. The article's about you. I'm supposed to be their queen one day! Do you not get that? What affects me affects the kingdom, affects my family, affects my brother! Did you read the article? No! I read the headline, which was plenty enough. Well, I suggest you read the article. You had no right to publish this. Listen to me. I had every right because you granted me permission for the interview and you let me record it, and it's a good thing I did. A good thing? When Andrey told me yesterday who you really were, I was hurt. You lied to me, princess. You lied to everybody here. I was just trying to protect the ones I love. By hurting the one person that matters the most? - You? - No. You. The worst person to lie to is yourself. But when I started writing the article, I was upset. I'd opened up to you. I told you about me dreams, my ambitions. I thought you'd understand. I thought we were the same like that. When I found out your true identity, well, I felt like you betrayed me. Yeah, I was gonna write the article to expose you out of spite. You were gonna? Isn't that exactly what you did? No, no, that's not what I did. I wrote that article because I hoped the truth would set you free. I've never lied to you, Elena. You could win this. You're that good. You just need to decide what you want. What's in your heart? Look at me. I believe in ya. I think it's about time you believed in yourself. It's too late. I missed the third task and I'll be disqualified, so it doesn't matter. - You've got 30 minutes, 30 minutes to come up with something genius. Season of bloom. They wanna see your personal growth. They wanna see the inner you. Where's Elena now? She's gone to the convention center to talk with Adam, and I should really be there for her. Hey, where are you going? I'm coming with you. But what about your allergies? Oh, stuff the allergies. Grab your coat. Time is once again up, ladies and gentlemen. Let us see your season of bloom. Ah ha! Quite striking, Mr. Svetkov. Yes, it really represents me. Yes, I'm quite sure it does. Ah! I say! Oh my word. Very creative, Mr. Dagga. - Thank you. But we appear to be missing our American competitor. I have it on good authority she has quit the competition. No she hasn't. Thank you. Objection. That woman is not Daisy McPherson. Her real name is Elena Ethrington of Fenwick. - Fenwick. - That's what I said, Fenwick. We know. We've all read the article, Andrey. Well, I demand she be removed from the Fee DT. Princess Elena entered under false pretenses and lied. She must be disqualified. Whoa, whoa, just slow down. Yes, Elena registered in the competition under a different name, but that was only to not draw attention to herself, so she couldn't use a celebrity status as an advantage, and there's no rules concerning name usage, right? Well, I believe not. And the real Daisy McPherson, she gave a complete permission to do so. - Is this true? - 100%, your honor. Oh, Miss McPherson, I presume. You presume correctly, your honor. You needn't call me your honor. - Aren't you a judge? - Not that kind of judge. Oh, well, there you go. Nobody's quite who they seem to be around here. Princess Elena said she was representing the United States and she's not even American. She's Fenwickian, or Fenwuckan. Princess Elena has lived in the United States for most of her life. She's a dual citizen Fenwick and the US. I looked at all for me article. That's the thing about America. Be whatever you wanna be. Follow your dreams. Mr. Birch is correct. Princess Elena is still officially a contestant for the World Bowl, and I'm pleased to announce she's also a finalist. However, this round's winner is Mr. Markus Dagga of South Africa! Which also makes him a finalist as well, along with Andrey Svetkov. Congratulations to all three of you! Now this final round will determine the winner of the entire tournament. I think I need a moment alone with my sister. Oh, okay. I have to go talk to my brother. Paul. Paul, I was on putting an end to all this today, I swear. I came here to officially quit- Which is why I had to come and stop you. - Stop me? - I read the article. So did Mum and Dad. I spoke to them on the way over. They probably hate me. What are you talking about? They love you, Elena, and so do I. This is what you're meant for. Believe it or not, the entire kingdom of Fenwick's rooting for you to win. It seems there are a lot of flower lovers in the world. This is the best publicity Fenwick could've hoped for. If you win, it could triple our tourist trade. You know, I spoke to Daisy the other day, and she gave me a business tip. Attractions attract money, and you are the star attraction of Fenwick. Because of you, we're right back on the map! So you want me to pursue my- Your dreams, career, absolutely. That Adam Birch was right. You're as much an American as you are a Fenwickian now. It wasn't till I read this article and started to see you through his eyes that I finally came to understand who you are. I really have to read this article. You should. It's sort of a love letter. Lovely as it is, please will you lose that crown? It's killing me. - Oh, sorry. Sorry. - Now, onto more pressing matters. Daisy kissed me. Did she now? Yeah, on the lips. Then we had breakfast together. I think she might like me. Oh, what's not to like? I don't quite know what to do. Kiss her back, duh. Ah. That is a thought. All right, you better go. You have a bowl to win. This final task will determine the winner of this year's Floral Designers Tournament World Bowl. The arrangement designs are open. You can design whatever you desire. The theme is love. Show me your expression of love through flowers. You will have two hours. I'm gonna love beating you so much. Oh, bring it. Don't worry about him. You got this. Oh, by the way, I never said that's my last article for the magazine. - They fired you? - No, they loved it. I quit. - Why? - You, I guess, because you inspired me. My writing is okay, but it's not my passion. I've gotta follow what's in my heart, too. Yeah. Life's too short to not do what you love. Now go. Win this thing. Contestants, take your positions, please. And begin! Time's up! The moments has arrived, ladies and gentlemen. All three finalists have given it their all to be the winner of this year's World Bowl. Let us witness their creations. The judges and I shall now deliberate for a few minutes, but we shall return with the final decision. Consider all of us winners. And I consider both of your losers. There can be only one winner on the Fee DT, and that winner is me. Yeah, I'm full of surprises. Thank you. That was excellent work from all of you, but there can be only one winner. Like I said. And this year, I am proud to announce it is Princess Elena of Fenwick and America! That's how it's done! Thank you. Thank you, guys. I really feel truly honored to be here. This has truly been a childhood dream for me, and I can't wait to share this award with my family and my friends in America and of course the great people of Fenwick. I couldn't have done it without them. They really inspired me, and I especially couldn't have done it without my partner in legal crime, Daisy. And that dashing man standing beside her is Prince Paul of Fenwick, my brother. I actually have something for you. Markus, do you mind? Thank you. I was inspired by you and I made this. Well, thank you, but I'm never wearing that. Oh, well, that's okay. I think Father has a better one waiting for you anyway. You mean for you. You're next in line. I wanna take this moment to hereby announce that I'm officially and willingly abdicating my heir to the royal crown and passing down the honor to my brother, Prince Paul. No, Elena, you can't do that. Paul, you're the right person for the job. We've always known it. I talked to Mother and Father, and they approve. I also think that King Paul of Fenwick has a nice ring to it, don't you? I don't know what to say! Well, I'm sure you'll think of something before coronation. And I think I should be giving this to you. Wait. No. This is your story. I'm just the friend, the sidekick. Like, no. I'm not supposed- Supposed to be what, princess? Hmm? Like you always, always wanted? The grass is always greener, right? King does need a queen. Yes. Princess Elena, I've got a last question. Yes? What are your plans now? Well, I had this crazy idea of opening up this cutting edge workshop, kind of like a floristry design center for gardens and those interested in making all types of other arrangements for different occasions. - Like weddings? - Yeah. Coronations? Well, yes, but maybe not this one. But I will need a partner to fulfill this dream. Interested? Yeah. You? Life's too short to not do what you love or to be with who you love. I finally read your article. - And? Well, it was missing a few things. Such as? Such as the perfect romantic ending. Okay, I see.
