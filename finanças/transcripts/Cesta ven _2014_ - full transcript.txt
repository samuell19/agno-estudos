Mum... Have you had these heart pains for a long time? Yes... for a while. How old were you when you had the termination? I mean, the abortion. I was fifteen, seventeen, and nineteen. I wanted to finish school. Do you take drugs? No, and nor does my partner. You had an operation for appendicitis when you were six, right? Your father is a smoker and an alcoholic. What about you and alcohol? Me, never. He hasn't drunk for a long time. He only drank after my mother's death. Mum... I went to the orphanage... I was fourteen. My sister was one. My mother was twenty-eight when she died. She was born in '73. How did she die? Our family put a spell on her and she died three months later. You're in good health, just a little nervous. You have to know your parents' medical history. "The apple never falls far from the tree." Know that? It's an image to explain heredity. That's why it's important to know your genetic background. So you can know what mistakes you will make, what you'll inflict on those close to you, and what you'll probably die of. Hi. Hello. Shit. When you're doing an apprenticeship, buy a phone. In the meantime, keep this one. First, Mum's turn. - Again, like that. - I'll put this on you. Hang on... Is that OK? More here. Close your eyes. You're looking for work in a see-through top? You're made up like a whore. You talk to the whore upstairs. - Isn't she your friend? - I don't speak to her. Don't talk to her like that. Cuckoo. Do I stink? I haven't had time to wash. No, you smell good. And that? It's OK, but it was better without the tank top. You want me to take it off? Leave it, it suite you too. Boys are dumb. That's obvious. He's no exception Here we have a small production line... I don't understand why you were called in. I don't see any professional experience in your CV. We cannot accept you. You stayed at home for three years. No professional experience acquired at school. That won't work. How can I get experience when nobody hires me? I know, but we export clothes throughout the European Union. So, this isn't a suitable position for you. I suggest DV, a company not far from here. They could have a suitable job for you. I don't want to say you're part of this group... But they employ socially handicapped people. I went to see them, but they're firing people. They don't have nothing. You mean they're laying people off... The situation can always change. It could get better in two months, so you mustn't stop trying. Looking at your professional experience... You do cleaning, don't you? Sometimes. - How many children do you have? - One. It's that... having children just after finishing school, it's not the greatest idea for starting a career. So, I'm sorry... I wish you good luck. I can't, I'm broke at the moment. The Ukrainians took everything. There's no work. Can't you wait a few days? I need the money. Don't make me break your van. No threats. Everyone needs money. Next time, if you want work, don't behave like a Jew. We don't need to buy this fridge. We can put things on the balcony, it's winter. Here, on the ground floor? Are you nuts, Žaneta? You want us to be robbed? You know I take care of you and Cuckoo. Your dad and brothers don't care. Don't fuck me around! You're not going to decide what I buy or not. Got that? If you hadn't lost your driver's license, you'd have a job! They confiscated it because I'm black! - No, 'cause you're an idiot. - Shut up! - Don't shout. - I'll do what I want. - Don't shout. - I will! - Not in front of the kid! - Get lost. Moron. Cretin! 'Cause you're black? 'Cause you're a dick! Cuckoo! Stop yelling. - What's it to you? - Dumbass! Cuckoo! Home! That's my seat. I haven't eaten yet because of you. You didn't go to school - you won't eat. Why do we pay for the canteen? Why are you speaking about lunch? It's dinner! Fuckers! You got shit for brains? That guy's on drugs. You want to get pregnant? Shut the fuck up. Don't talk to me like that. If I see you with him again, I'll smack both your heads in. What you gotta learn? School is the most important thing. The time for boys will come later! Look at me. You want to be thick like me? What if I took private lessons with that whore, Andrea? You know how well she speaks with the Germans: in her Roma tongue! What are you doing, faggot? Don't touch me, OK? Leave her in peace. And you, don't be so stupid. Fill in your homework, then you can eat, OK? I'd rather die. Hi. Fifth Avenue are looking for a waitress. It's well paid. Good tips. Well, you're probably loaded. It's not for me, spending the night with men. No way. OK... What did that whore want? She told me about a waitress job in Fifth Avenue. Yeah, sure. You're not hanging around in bars. Come here, it'll be OK. Forget it. Go home. They won't trust you if you go all alone. I'm coming with you. Even if I wanted to, I can no longer get into the system. I'm sorry. You're too late. The computer already sent the information that he didn't sign on. It's the second time. He'll lose his right to benefits. But I'm telling you, my daughter doesn't sleep at night. That's why we went back to sleep. He doesn't work illegally. He was ready to come here. They're the rules for welfare. To benefit from it, you must adapt. Be on time 3 times a month, that's not so hard, isn't it? Czechs, Czechs! Who are the indigenous people? Gas the Gypos - What must we do? - The radical solution! You want to kill the gypsies? The protesters say the Roma get special treatment. Go to work, Gypos! These Roma tenants say that nobody will give them a job. Come on, then Show yourself! We're not afraid of you Come here and say that. Go to work, Gypos! They don't have work either. They're social cases too. She's drunk, isn't she? For real, but if she wasn't, she wouldn't go to see these fascists. She drank a litre of vodka and went to see them. She's great! - So how do you live? - I have a friend. He gets welfare, and the others get nothing. - Who? - Us. Let those black bastards fall! The Roma organizations and other NGOs say the anti-Roma climate is orchestrated by certain politicians who want to distract attention from the siphoning-off of public funds and European subsidies. One of the protagonists is the lobbyist Vít Jakeš. He is suspected of helping them provoke these-anti-Roma hate marches to make citizens forget the corruption of the political elite. Goodbye. Hello. - Excuse me? - No, nothing. Hello, princess. I need to talk to you. You're so beautiful, princess! I'll give you some cash. Go get yourself something. And some cigarettes for yourself. I don't smoke, I'm thirteen. Alright, cookies then, or whatever. Know how much you owe me? - I don't have it. - How come? I don't have it. You think I'm a cash machine? Or what? - I don't have it. - You trying to piss me off? You trying to piss me off, you shit? Hold that. You trying to piss me off? Want me to break your arms? Think I have a pussy between my legs? If you don't pay me. For now, I'm only breaking your little finger. You get it? Here's 4,000 crowns. You'll pay back 5,000 crowns. Get well soon, so you can go back to work. Are you messing with me? I give you my word: I'll give it all back. Which hand are you giving me? Give me the other. Žaneta, please. The social services want me to send them something by computer. Are you messing with me? Sorry, Dad, I don't have any credit. Cuckoo, please, do you have any credit? Can you unlock it for me? Dial the number. My credit's low. Tell them to call you back. Never mind, I'll walk there. What're you looking for? Know where my birth certificate is? No idea. Did you look for it at your place? When your mother was alive, she put everything in a big yellow envelope. You know where it is? I don't know, Dad. You must pay attention to things like that. God, how do you expect me to keep it all this time? I'll look into it. And next time, you could take off your shoes. Look at Mummy. Look at the photo. Look for your Daddy, too. It won't be here. I would've already found it. Cuckoo? You know about this? No, what is it? David borrowed some money. Didn't he tell you? What? It pisses me off, how we treat each other. We live in the same building, and we ignore each other. You don't even say hello. Do you remember Mum? She loved you. Come in. Sit down. And the one who just left, isn't he on TV? I know his face. Yes, it's this business. It's all over Facebook. Oh, yeah! Shit, he's the one doing all that anti-gypsy politics, isn't he? Incredible. If you saw his place. Insane. Wads of banknotes this big. Euros stacked in the drawers. It's too much. And all this stuff he gets me to do. I can't take it anymore. I'm going mental. Come here. At least you manage. Not me. We'll soon be on the streets. I have no more money. On the shelf, there's a box. Go on. Go on! I'll go to his place. You'll come with me. We'll do it. He likes it when I strangle him. Squeeze a bit more. You'll help me carry the bags of money. If it goes wrong... We're just whores. And we fucked up. But he wanted us to do it. You know, a few months or a year, for all that money... Do you know what he's like? A real fucking bastard! Will we let them fuck us forever? We don't need to kill him. It'll be done fast and clean with my brothers. But we mustn't screw up. David, I just want my children to go to school, so they can go on vacation and have nice things. They don't need a father in jail. Will they ever let us live in peace? There'll never be any work. We'll stay quiet for 10 years. I'll buy a van, start my own business, and no more thieving. Promise me to forget all that, and Andrea, too. Tomorrow, you pay off your debt, and the subject is closed. Where does all this money come from? I borrowed it from a friend. Is it forbidden to borrow when you have bills to pay? No, but I need your friend to prove where this money comes from. You know that benefit fraud is a crime. I need to check that the money doesn't come from undeclared work, that you do so often. There's no law broken. I earned a thousand crowns last month. And you'll deduct it from my benefits. How can I get by? I got bills to pay, electricity-, water, and all the rest. I have a kid! We have to account for all your income. It's only natural. Try to find a full-time job. What do you think? I'm looking for one! I kept the TV because of the kid. Why don't you lift up the backrest? It's broken. It needs fixing. Here. See the camera? We've seen it for an hour, you idiot. The bosses swindle and arrange things among themselves and it's fine. They crush us little guys. Get it? I'd like to tear that thing down. Could I? You're nuts! You're out of your mind! You're worthless! Why did you take him with you? He'll ruin everything. He's a fucking moron. Look: they're checking us out. Of course, they see a car full of blacks. Don't spit, idiot. They know who your father is just by your spit. Oh yeah? No, I said it for a laugh! Where do I put the butt? In the damn ashtray! Throw it outside, so they can find us, idiot! I explained it to you: The saliva! DNA! Is that radiology or what? No, it comes from our mother! God, I could punch him sometimes. So if I spat here in the car, they'll know? Fuck, David, where did Mum find him? I dunno. Shut up for a while. Well, you know, I didn't know. What's that? Maybe the maid. I'll go with David. We'll say we're coming for the meter. We jump on her, we tie her up. And we're in. Then, we can do what we want. Where were you? I needed to clear my head. Where? We walked. Who with? With friends. It itches so much. Show me. Does it hurt? Go to the doctor, it's free. What's that? I drew that with Sara. Promise me you're not planning anything with Andrea. I promise. Swear on the kid's life. I swear on the head of ...ara we're not planning anything. I READ FUTURE IN HAND Hey, bro. Where are you with Andrea? I looked for you everywhere. Why didn't you come? I have doubts. What doubts? What's wrong? Let's go see him. We won't give up. It's a good plan. Hey... Hi... brother. So, we're going to break into that place that we marked? - We're going? - What're you talking about? You know, the place we marked and how we decided to go there. Do you think you can do a break-in with me? Listen. I saw an angel. He told me that... I dunno, I dunno. You're stoned! He said to me: Come... And I said: What? Go on, tell me. And he said: Come here. And I went there... went... You know what? I went there. Listen, fuckin' bums. I went there, just like that. Overdose, you bastard. I'm dropping you. Don't you get it? I get it, but wait.. Die. It's OK, us two will do it! I'm sorry! I'm not doing it anymore. Not with you. You're stoned. Go fuck yourself. David! What's all this? Are you shitting me? Give me that. Are you crazy or what? I helped you! What did you buy all that with? If I see you with him again, I'll kill you! Look out, the Queen Bee's coming And you're staying here? Fuck off and die! I know she wants to lead you astray. It's her or me. Andrea: Come to mine. Waiting for his call drives me crazy. David: Coming. You still there? - How much you need? - Three thousand. - Two thousand five. - Two thousand seven. I can't. Two thousand five. - With the phone? - Two seven. You even gave Mom's gold? Where are you going? Butt out. What's this? She just shows up like this! I said, butt out. Come here, Sara. Here's your family! Take care of them. So? What're you going to do? Stop complaining. Yeah, I'm complaining. I'm entitled to! I pay here, I clean, I do everything! Shut up! It's my Dad's place. You hear? I got nothing to explain to you! She can't keep her man and she turns up with her bags! I came to my Dad's, so shut up! Take care of this mess! What'll social services say? We'll be in trouble! I don't give a shit about social services! Clean up. Piece of filth look at how you live! She's blaming me for that? Calm down! Your son will sleep here, with you! I don't give a shit! Why did you come here? Calm down! Shut your mouth! Take your bags and get out! Shut up! Žaneta, what is it? Did he cheat on you? Did you cheat on him? Take your bags and get out! If the social services see, we'll be in trouble. Aren't you ashamed? No, Dad. It's your bed, you'll sleep in it. We'll take the other bed. He'll sleep in the kitchen. But why? He's your brother. He's not our brother, just as this woman isn't our mother. Did you hear that? I'm not staying here. Go fuck yourself. I don't believe what I'm hearing. They'll be the death of me. And you'll all live off my benefit money? What's that whitey doing here? Vlada met him outside. He brought him here. He's out of jail and has nowhere to sleep. So, we took him in. I thought he'd help us with the money, that he'd get benefits, that we'd be better off. Are you thinking straight? You take in a convict? You're not afraid he'll hurt you? That you'll catch something? I don't have the heart to kick him out. You trust anyone. That's not right. We'll wait downstairs. We'll come back when you get rid of him. Come on. - Where are you taking that? - My place. That's my stroller. It's my stroller! Leave it! I said leave it! Stop! It's mine, bitches! I'm gonna call the cops! Leave it! Fuck you! Thief! You're the thief! You're the fuckin' thief! I found it. That's it, you got a kid at home. You got a kid Fuck! When we're loaded with cash, she'll come back. Two Scotch on the rocks. Keep the change. - I'm going home. - You're going to school! Wait here. Why? They don't want us there. Shit! Come back. I'm not doing it anymore. On my family's life. You already swore on Sara's life, fucking idiot. No, I swore on the life of "...ara' You didn't hear right. No plaster cast? I had something wrong, so they took it off. Let's go to England. There'll be a future for Sara and Cuckoo. You think they're waiting for us?! What do you know? "OK, football, thank you"? That's the best you can do. Stop it, sis. We're going back. Come on. Fuckin' bitch! Gotta stop, bitch! Don't be insulting Is that any way to fuckin' behave? The other sonovabitch didn't stop. So, why insult this lady who was kind enough to stop? Assholes! Be glad she's letting you on! What did you do? Go back to him. I don't want a criminal. He's the father of your child. Too right! He'll be lost without you. He'll go nuts. Go back to him. No. I hope she goes back where she came from. His girlfriend will come live here. She's pregnant. What? What can I do? I'm with her. She's my lady, she'll come to our place. I'm not a lesbian. You want me to live at their place? Am I the married one, the woman? It's not my fault. I'm with her, she'll live with us. How can you feed a child? When it's born, I'll find work, a seasonal job, I'll deal with it. In the meantime, play with your phone. What's with her? We won't go far if kids are still having kids today! What are you saying? Children are a gift from God. Perhaps a long time ago, in Slovakia. But not now. There, you had free food and water. You used to eat stolen hens and potatoes. Where do you live? You're stupid. Everything was free under the communists: water, electricity, school, buses, gas. Don't let David in. Gas is still free if you fart well enough. The words of a future dad! Hello. We've come from Social Welfare. - Have a seat. - Thanks. I was telling my daughter we'll buy curtains and flowers to improve things here. Hey... We didn't come to talk about your curtains, but to solve the problem with your son. Give me a fluorescent jacket, I'll clean the park like a fag. I must look after my family! Don't you understand Czech? We've nothing for you this month. What about retraining? Next month, I already told you. What good are you? It's hard to help someone without schooling. What am I to do? Steal? Go to England? If you believe in it, go on. That's a good one! You black bastard, you're assaulting a woman? Any professional experience? Six months. After, they closed the plant. And then, I was on maternity leave. This is the lining of the pocket. The pocket is drawn here. Try going backwards. More quickly. Like that. Great. Žaneta, don't be afraid. If you can sew, I'll take you on. But first of all, where do you live? In the projects, but I'm thinking of going to a hostel. - To a hostel? - 'Cause of the transport. What about the kid if I take you on? My boyfriend is unemployed. He'll take care of her. Would you prefer part-time work? I'd like to ask you you're Roma, aren't you? Should I be afraid that you'll miss work? No. Because if I take you on, you must come to work. Here we have girls with disabilities problems with their hearts, the after-effects of a stroke. They have machines that let them work just with their hands. If we take you on, I think you should be grateful and come to work regularly. Where's Žaneta? Who is it? 'Evening. I need to talk to her. Please bring me a glass. Don't want one. Have a drink with me. I don't feel like it. I need to talk to her. Have a drink with me. - Did you catch up with him? - No. You didn't speak to him? Forget it, it's cold. Wait. Sit down, Cuckoo. Žaneta, when you were little, you were seriously ill. You fell into a coma. And when you woke up, you told us. You were walking in a field and there were flowers all around. But you didn't want to climb the hill. You knew that if you got to the top, it would be the end. But you kept going up to a large podium. There was a cross and a lot of people dressed in white clothes. They pushed you and said "Go back, you still have time. You have your life ahead of you. Go back." And like that, you were returned to us. Once, I met a nice old gypsy woman. She looked into the stroller and she said that you'd be a great success, have a beautiful life. I'm terribly sorry... that I can't help you. You know I love you... both of you. But things are going wrong for me. I'm no use. Come on, Dad, it's cold. You'll go faraway with your Mum... And we'll be sad without you. Well, bye. Cuckoo, I have to go. This is for you. Where did you get it? A boy gave it to me. He gave you a phone, just like that? Just like that, he's a friend. Do you think I'm fuckin' stupid? You stole it? Don't we have enough problems? If I find out you stole it, you'll be for it. Is that clear? I'll come back for you. Come here. Up you get, Sara. Let's go. Here's the key to the bathroom. You're 15 minutes late, that's a fine of 200 crowns. Why? I lent the keys to a neighbour! This lady was there, she'll back me up. This isn't communism here. You borrow the key only for yourself, not for everyone else. That's great that you've found a job. I want to get out of here, too, later on. - Is everything OK? - Yes. What is it? Who called? No one. No one? Your phone rang. CALL ME Leave me alone. I have a job here. It's impossible. - Take your things and come. - No. You want your daughter to grow up without a father? Stop it. Stop. What are you doing this evening? Nothing. You want to hit the town? I dunno. Will you throw me out? Are you crazy? I don't want to stay with them. - Are you hungry? - Yes. How did you do that? Hang on. Marian? Can you hear me? David? When can you come? In two days, I'll sort everything out, give the keys back, and I'll be there. I can't pay the rent anymore. They say there's work in Germany. Cuckoo is here. Call you later. Come on, we'll manage. I'll just give her something to eat. Wait for me. Žaneta, what are you doing here? - I want to talk to you. - I don't. - What? - You heard. So, you're acting like a whitey now, going to a nightclub? What's it to you? Do I stick my nose in your life? And my brother? What about your brother? - Don't you have a child together? - What's that to you? I'll be back in a few minutes. If you're still here, I'll kick your ass. Is that clear? Try it. You'll see. Get out of here! You get lost! You'll see! Oh, I'm so scared! Where's Žaneta? Are you coming in without her? She's with us. I can't let her in. We want to prevent trouble. Are you coming in or not? - I guess. - Open your bag. I love him, I have a child with him, but I don't know what to do. What? I love him and I have a child with him. I've been robbed, too! The money and the phone! Let it go. You can't do anything. Let's not be put off by it! Come on. And now in D minor Yuck! I'd like to let you sleep at our place but I can't. Anyway, I have my daughter. - Hi, girls! - Leave her alone. What are you up to? What're you doing? You know him? She's family. She lived with my brother. What's wrong? Enough. I'm leaving, OK? Wait. Come here! - Let me go! - Did you hear me? Come here! Idiot! Žaneta! Is all that because of her? Are you listening to me? Is my brother home? You fooling around? What's the matter? Look, clear off. You're drunk as a skunk. Don't hit me, moron. - You're stoned? - You want a cigarette? Here. Why throw it away? Go on, get rid of everything. Throw me out with the whole family! You dropped everything. You go around drunk. Have you become a lesbian with that bitch? I love him, I have a child with him, but I don't know what to do. Get out of here. Stop it. You see? I'm immortal. I hold on here and there... My brother needs you. And we've always been good to each other. Here, I'll sing for you. Hi, my little devil Have you been good? I haven't been good. You haven't been good? - What's that? - It hurts. What hurts? Show me your belly. Veronika, the kids are full of bedbug bites. Why didn't you say? What am I to do? Complain to the guys downstairs? They'll say: If you're not happy, go. If you're so smart, you go. I'm going. I see you're too scared. Where will we go with all our kids? What will she do? This is insane! Don't involve me. I've enough problems. It gives me a headache. Where will we go? Are you thinking about us? - Did you get bitten, too? - No. What's that? You've been bitten. You think that if you go see them, they'll get rid of the bedbugs? It won't change. You know what? Take a bug and tell it to go! I'm going to see them! - You're going nowhere! - What? You're going to complain. So will the dirty bastards who brought them in their German furniture. Then, where will we go with our kids? That fucker is gonna do something! I can't even take my daughter out! What's happening? Shit! What's happening? Go to your rooms or I'll call the police. - There are bedbugs everywhere. - What bedbugs? I don't know where they're coming from. Nobody is stopping you. Pack your bags and go. What do you think you're playing at? Relax or you're going to jail. Who's going to jail? I think we'll be off. I'll kick your ass! Why yell at him? You're causing trouble. You're causing revolution and rebellion here. The others aren't. So, you can fuck off. What revolution? Give us flags! We signed a contract. Fuck with me and I'll call the social services and TV and raise hell! This hostel's private. The social services can't come in. And you keep drawing on the walls. Who did that? Who drew that? Maybe you did! Kids drawing on walls annoys you, not that they're bitten by bedbugs? I'll remove that and make you pay. All of you. To make money! Go to your rooms. I don't want to see you here anymore. I'll kick your ass, cock-sucking fucker! - I'm afraid. - Don't be. Hi. So you're pimping with David? Because of those brothels downstairs? It belongs to the Ukrainians. We work in Germany. I'm afraid. Don't be. If you stay, we'll redecorate the place. But you must stay. With David. Yeah? You must stay. We put good gypsies in here and fix the place up. Come in the stroller. No need. It's close by. Come and take the stroller. Who's that whitey? I found him in a public square. He had nowhere to go. His mother tortured him, his family beat him up. I took pity and brought him home. A poor homeless boy. What about your father? Not well. Why? He hasn't worked for ten years. You know what it's like. I see you've already replaced me. Don't be jealous. It's a christening. We're just having a drink. Move over there, please. I'm so happy you're here. I have work at Marian's. In Euros. I'm not sure I'll stay. Stop it, my love. My love? You talk to other women! Why am I here? Who for? You don't miss me and the kid! Of course I do. Why am I on my own here? They're just sitting next to me. - You weren't on your own! - Stop it. You're so jealous. This is our family. Trust him, please. You're the only one for me. - Have some. - I don't want any. - Come on. - I'm not hungry. Eat it. Want a drink? Drink. You know I'm here for work. Cut it out. What time is it? 8:30. Are you playing with them? - Have you been good? - No. David, wake up. To work! Marian! - Is Marian up? - He's sleeping. Wake him up. They must go to work. Marian, wake up. Wake up! Be careful! It'd be dumb to die here. You shouldn't drink so much!
