Uh, if you see Chuck, just tell him I'm heading home. Sure. I really like the way you sing. (CHUCKLES) Thank you. I couldn't take my eyes off your voice. That's a fact. If I ever get to make an album, maybe you'd like to watch it sometime. I think you struck out, Darryl. It's three and two. DEBBY: There you go. Thank you. DARRYL: (KNOCKING) Uh... -Miss Huston? -Yeah. DARRYL: What do you say, guys? I, uh, I didn't mean I didn't like your voice. I did. I just liked looking at the place your voice was coming from. Damn, that didn't come out right either, did it? Well, it's not my fault you look the way you do, is it? Well, it's not my fault you talk the way you do, is it? Oh. I really got to be going. * Everybody's got a hungry heart * Lay down your money and you play your part * Everybody's got a hu-hu-hungry heart * ANNOUNCER: Batting third, number four, right fielder Darryl Palmer. WOMAN: Hit it out of the park, Palmer! MAN: Let's go, baby. Take 'em to the field. Let's go. -Time. -MAN: Come on. Hit it out of here. WOMAN: Okay, Darryl, let's do it! MAN: Keep your eye on it, Darryl! * Guess I should've known * By the way you parked your car sideways * That it wouldn't last * See, you're the kind of guy * That believes in making out once * Love 'em, leave 'em fast * I guess I must be dumb * 'Cause you had a pocket full of horses * Trojans and some of them used Strike! * But it was Saturday night * I guess that makes it all right * And you say what have I got to lose * And I say * Little red Corvette * Baby, you're much too fast * Little red Corvette * You need a love that's gonna last * I guess I should've closed my eyes * When you drove me to the place * Where your horses run free...

Next time I'll watch with my eyes closed. What are you doing tomorrow? We got a day off. * But it was Saturday night * I guess that makes it all right * And you say "Baby, have you got enough gas?" * I say, little red Corvette * Baby, you're much too fast * Little red Corvette * You need a love that's gonna last... * Look, don't worry about it.

(SHUTS CAR DOOR) I'm real sorry. Are you all right? DEBBY: What do you mean, am I all right? Do I look all right? Yeah, you look great. Your car looks like crap, though. I was rushing. And I didn't want to miss you. Well, you certainly didn't "miss me", did you? Do you know what that's gonna cost me to get that fixed? Ten dollars. Ten dollars? Yeah, I'll pay the other $600. Well, how am I going to get to work? I'm playing err... Tomorrow night. Limousine. I'll send you a limousine with a color TV and little sandwiches in the back. I don't want little sandwiches. I want my car! I love my car! Just leave me alone! Jesus Christ. Who hit my car? That is a brand new car. That's all right, sir. I'm gonna take care of everything. (ENGINE REVVS UP) (TIRES SQUEALING) -(CREAKING NOISE) -(OLD MAN SCREAMING) -(GLASS SHATTERING) -(CAR STOPS) I promise things are gonna pick up between us. Don't give up on me. * Corvette * Little red Corvette DARRYL: Your money or your life. -Hey, hey, what's happening, Darryl? -Hey, Chuck. What'd you do, bring the whole damn team with you? Yeah, I brought a few of them. Are we all set for tonight? -Absolutely. -All right! * Ooh Ooh * Ooh yeah * A body like yours oughta be in jail * It's on the verge of being obscene (GASPING) * Move over baby, gimme those keys * I'm gonna try to tame your little red love machine * Little red Corvette * Baby you're much too fast... -It ain't gonna work, man. -It'll work! Moose, you think it's gonna work? Shit, no, he's just gonna embarrass himself. He's gonna embarrass the whole team. Clutch! I am a clutch hitter. I love pressure. Honey, bring me a pressure burger. WAITRESS: Sure. Coming right up. * Little red Corvette * 'Cause if you don't * You're gonna run into the ground * Little red (APPLAUDING, CHEERING AND WHOOPING) Hey, Debby! -Ain't she good? -(WOLF WHISTLES) Let me have a light here, Lyle. Thank you. Now, we all know the Atlanta Braves have been struggling pretty hard this year. And I got to say this as much as it pains me. We got a fellow out there in right field who's having a real hard time with the bat. Mr. Darryl Palmer. (CHEERING, APPLAUDING) You're hitting what, Darryl, .244? .239. I went 0-for-5 today. (CROWD MOANING) Darryl's real anxious to make us proud of our Braves. So he's promised to hit not one, but two home runs out of the park tomorrow! (APPLAUDING, CHEERING) Now... That's a real tall order, Darryl. If you want to withdraw, you just say so, we'll forget the whole thing right now. I'm gonna go for it, all right, on one condition. If I do, Miss Debby Huston promises to have dinner with me after the game. (APPLAUDING, WHOOPING, CHEERING) Now, now, if I don't, she's off the hook. And I give $1,000 to her favorite charity. (APPLAUDING, CHEERING) Now, you heard the offer, Debby. What do you say? MAN: Go for it. (CROWD APPLAUDING, CHEERING) Well, I already have a date for tomorrow night. -(CROWD MOANING) -WOMAN: Come on, do it! But considering the fact I'm gonna raise $1,000 for charity without much risk of breaking my date, I accept. -Thank you, ma'am! -(APPLAUDING, CHEERING) I'll see you at the players' gate right after the game. Dress semi-casual. (APPLAUDING, WHISTLING, CHEERING) You're semi-freaking crazy, that's what. Two homers? You can't drive a truck that far. You know why I haven't been hitting all year? Nothing has inspired me... Until now. That is my inspiration. COMMENTATOR: It's one-nothing, Astros. We're in the bottom of the second inning. Thus far, Mark Fidrych has been excellent. The Bird really doing his thing. UMPIRE: Strike! (CROWD CHATTERING, WHISTLING) (GULPING) Man, oh, man, that guy is throwing some shit. -COMMENTATOR: The two-two pitch. Strike three called. -Strike! Come on. Take yourself out of the game, Darryl. Tell them you're sick. I am. I just swallowed my tobacco. -(COMMENTATOR ANNOUNCING) -(CROWD CHATTERING) (CROWD WHISTLING, APPLAUDING) When was the goddamn last time you hit two home runs in one game? High school. It was a 24-inning game. I batted 12 times. (CROWD CHEERING) MAN: Do it, Darryl. MAN1: Give it a rip. MAN2: Just meet it. ANNOUNCER: Batting third, number four, Darryl Palmer. Play ball. COMMENTATOR: Fidrych, the tall gangly right-hander, gets the sign. Strike! COMMENTATOR: There's strike one to Palmer. (INAUDIBLE) (CROWD CHATTERING) And the pitch on the way to Darryl Palmer. Foul tipped into the glove. Palmer swings. There's a line drive, deep left field. This one is out of here! UMPIRE: Outta here! (APPLAUDING, WHISTLING, CHEERING) You have to come around here more often. (WHOOPING, TRILLING) (CROWD APPLAUDING, CHEERING) COMMENTATOR: Darryl Palmer, a very happy man -as he goes back to the dugout. -(WHOOPING) BURLY: You hit one for that girl, but you won't hit one for me. I told you to go on a diet. I don't like them fat. COMMENTATOR: Now, we go to the bottom of the fourth inning and Darryl Palmer will lead off for the Braves. And here's Fidrych with the wind and the pitch. It's hit deep to right center field! Back to the wall, it is gone! Darryl Palmer's second home run of the game. -(WHOOPING) -Where's a phone? I've got to break my date for tonight. You didn't think I could do it today, did you? No, I didn't. I even bet our drummer $25 you had no chance. -Are you hot? -Nah. I'm just not used to wearing ties. DEBBY: Well, then why are you wearing one? I'm putting on my best. I'm trying to impress you. -Why? -Because you're special. You're a lady. I knew that the first minute I saw you. (CHUCKLES) You're not anything like what I expected a ballplayer to be like. I know. It's refreshing, isn't it? (CHUCKLES) I don't mean this to sound insulting, but you really do come off a little too sure of yourself for your own good. DARRYL: Well, that's the refreshing part. Underneath all this hot-dogging, I'm as shy as a puppy, you'll see. Pretty soon... I'm gonna be standing up on the end of my chair, begging for food, and you're gonna be throwing me little pieces of chicken. (CHUCKLING) You are crazy. Excuse me. I hope you enjoy your dinner. Thank you. Your chicken looks a little dry. Her chicken looks a little dry. Does it look a little dry to you? No, it looks fine to me! I don't want you eating dry chicken on our first date. You'll remember it the rest of your life. No, no, no, it's not chicken, its duck. It is? She ordered chicken, this is duck. Take it back. No, I ordered duck. I love duck! Please, leave the duck. Sure the duck isn't too dry? Why don't you bring her another duck. I like dry duck. I asked for it dry. Please, leave the duck. -Yeah, leave the duck and forget the chicken. -Yes, sir. Oh, and could you bring us some more wine. Oh, no! I'm sorry. Did it get you? (CHUCKLING) No, it's all right. What do you mean, it's all right! I ruined your dress. No, it didn't get on my dress. It got on my duck. It did? I thought that duck was too dry, anyway. Here. Could you just bring us another duck. I don't want another duck. I'm fine! Will you relax? Please! I think I can safely say that this is the worst night of my entire life. Well, I'm beginning to enjoy it. (CHUCKLING) I'm glad someone is. My pants are soaking wet. We'll have to stay all night. It's amazing how you didn't get nervous at the ballgame. You've got guts. I'll tell you that. And what would you have done if you'd struck out? That wasn't the point. I was trying to get across how I felt. Did you ever see Gene Kelly in Singin' in the Rain? Splashing his shoes in the water, swinging from the lamppost. About 12 times. That's what I was doing up there at the plate. I knew you was watching me, and I can't sing, and I can't dance, But I sure as hell can swing a 34-ounce bat. Hitting the hell out of that ball... That was the only way I could tell you how I felt about you. (CHUCKLES) You are something. I never know what you're gonna say to me next. Depends on which drink I'm gonna spill. I'll be better at the next dinner. Next dinner? I've already paid off my debt. You planning on hitting four home runs tomorrow? I don't know. I'll come up with something. What's wrong? The duck is dry. (SINGIN' IN THE RAIN PLAYING) -(CHUCKLES) -* I'm singing in the rain * Just singing in the rain * What a glorious feeling * I'm happy again -(LAUGHING) * I'm laughing at clouds * So dark up above * The sun's in my heart -(SPLASHING) * And I'm ready for love * Let the stormy clouds chase * Everyone from the place * Come on with the rain * I've a smile on my face * I'll walk down the lane -(LAUGHING) * To a happy refrain * I'm singing, singing in the rain... * (LAUGHING) DARRYL: All right, here we are. -This is my kind of place. -Oh, yeah? DARRYL: Two doubles, two singles, four RBIs... You had a real good day today. DEBBY: I did? DARRYL: Yeah... We're partners in this thing. I go up to bat, -feel your hands on the bat right next to mine. -(CHUCKLES) We're hitting .271. * I'm just a red-blooded fun-loving all-American boy -(INDISTINCT CHATTERING) -I'll have a duck... -Yeah, right over there. * I'm just a red-blooded fun-loving all-American boy (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) Warner, how you doing? Hey, Darryl, how you doing? I love adulation. I love being recognized. Well, at least you're honest. I love being honest. Four, with everything that's bad, Pepi. No charge for Mr. Atlanta. I love being Mr. Atlanta. -So what's it feel like? -What? Hitting a home run. -You don't feel it at all. -Nothing? If you catch it in the sweet spot, the dead center of the bat, there's no weight. It's just like cutting through air. It kinda... (WHOOSHING) ...takes off. You don't even watch it. You know before anyone else in the stands. You just put your head down, circle the bases real slow, drink in all the applause. Greatest sound a ballplayer ever hears. "Sweet thunder," That's what we call it. Yeah, I've had that feeling. Oh, yeah? Which league was that in? It was up there on stage! Sometimes I get a hold of a song, I don't even realize I'm singing it. It just floats outta there all by itself pretty as anything you've ever heard. And that's when it works, you know. I mean, that's when I know I made music. Yeah, that's it. Listen, double-header tomorrow. Want me to pick you up? I'm going to Boston. I'm going to be gone for two weeks. Two weeks? Well, I gotta make a living, same as you. No, you don't. I can make a living for both of us. If I get 20 more runs batted in, I'm gonna hold out for the big money. Well, I earn my own money. What are you saying? You want to keep me? No, I just want to take care of you. I mean, you're not gonna be singing in clubs the rest of your life. Well, how do you know? I like singing in clubs. And maybe I'll get that record contract. Don't you try taking away what I love doing best. I wouldn't ask you to give up baseball. (MUSIC PLAYING) DEBBY: I don't want to be behind any man. If it's the right man and the right time, then standing side-by-side with him is where I wanna be. DARRYL: Am I rushing you? DEBBY: Yeah, you're rushing me! Would I be rushing you if I kissed you goodbye? Yeah! What kind of kiss? Regular. Just lips. Not too juicy. the number five, boy-next-door kiss. Do you stay up all night thinking of things... * Out of the blue and into the black (CHUCKLES) You are dangerous. * Pay for this * But they give you that * And once you're gone * You can't go back * You're out of the blue and into the black... * (DEBBY BREATHING HEAVILY) If you have something to say, I'd be very glad to listen at this time. (EXHALES) I'm scared. -Of what? -Of everything. My life, my career, means a lot to me. How am I going to manage you and a career at the same time? I won't take your career away. Oh, yes, you will. I know your kind. Possessive as hell. You're the kind that needs his woman around all the time, aren't you? I don't know. I never wanted one around more than overnight before. Am I really scaring you? Because I'll stop. If that's what you want. I'll tell you when to stop. You're just gonna have to teach me. You don't seem to be having any trouble. I'm talking about baseball! I don't know the first thing about it. Baseball. Sure. Whenever you want. Well, how about right now? -Now? -Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. (CHUCKLING) -Okay, now, this is first base. -Uh-huh. DARRYL: This is second... Third... And home plate's right about... (KISSES) There. Ooh, that's home plate? Yeah, right about there. Oh... So then what happens? -DARRYL: Well, then the batter steps up. -Uh-huh. And the pitcher pitches. -Ooh... -Now, that's a fastball, that's a curve... Uh-huh. And that is a slider. (MOANS) Ooh, that slider is a hell of a pitch. DARRYL: You want to see my splitter? Uh-huh! Uh-huh. Mmm. * It's better to burn out * Than fade away COMMENTATOR: Batting third, number four, (INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER) Darryl Palmer. -DARRYL: Time? -Time! COMMENTATOR: Now time is called. I think Palmer might have called time. (OH JIM PLAYING ON RADIO) BURLY: Hit it out of the park there, big guy! Play ball. -What in the hell is this? -DARRYL: What? What do you mean, what? There's singing coming out of your damn pocket! In my pocket? What have you got back there, Palmer? Nothing. It's just a cassette. -You can't listen to music during the game. -Why not? I listened to Star-Spangled Banne didn't I? CATCHER: Well, how do we know he's not getting signals on this damn thing from up the stands. He knows what pitch is coming up, and I'll guaran-damn-tee that's why he's been hitting the damn ball lately too. Give it to me, Palmer. (SONG CONTINUES PLAYING) I could fine you for this. She's good luck to me. He wears a rabbit's foot around his neck, doesn't he? Yeah, but the damn thing doesn't sing songs. All right, let's get back in there and play ball now. -(INDISTINCT CHATTERING) -Come on, Pete! Let's get this yo-yo out of here! Come on, pal. COMMENTATOR: Well, it's all straightened out now, and back in the batter's box is Palmer. Work hard, let's go. Work hard! The wind by Columbo. Here's the pitch. -(GRUNTS) -It's hit to deep left center field. I got her perfume on my bat. (CHEERING) * Don't you wanna do it * Yeah, Jimmy we could make it right * DEBBY: Darryl! -Hi! -Hi. -Hi! -Mmm. (MOANING) I thought you were still playing in Boston. We're shut on Mondays. We can stay in bed till 4:00 tomorrow afternoon. (MOANING) Let's get out of here. You look thin. I lost six pounds. -I don't eat too good when you're away. -(MOANS) * Oh, Jimmy don't you wanna do it * Yeah, Jimmy we could make it right * Oh, Jimmy you know where to put it * 'Cause I got what you want tonight * Are you sure can eat another one? It's awful big. I never ate a steak cooked as good as this. What do you do? You just look at it? I hit .424 in the last six games. Burly came up to me, and he says, "Kid, keep this up, "next year we're going to the World Series. "Take my advice," he says, "And marry that girl. "She's gonna make us all rich." Marry me? Thanks for popping the question. I was too nervous to ask. Now, wait a minute, Darryl. I never planned on getting married. Do you love me? I don't mean never, I just meant now. My career's just beginning to get started. People are just beginning to notice me. Do you love me? I'm not sure I'd make a good wife. You need someone around all the time! I'm not... I'm not cut out to be a baseball wife, sitting in the stands every day. Do you love me? (JITTERING NERVOUSLY) PRIEST: Deborah, will you have this man to be your lawful wedded husband, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to be together as long as you both shall live? And if she says, "I do," we're in next year's playoffs. I do. Who says I'm not a great manager? (CHUCKLES) COMMENTATOR: And in a moment, we'll be ready to go. Yup, you got it. Where were you? I'm up at bat. For Christ's sakes, I've been stalling like crazy. Oh, I'm sorry, honey, but they kept me on for four extra numbers and there's some record people here tonight. Burly, you better get him out here! If he doesn't bat right now, he's gonna be out! His mother's in the hospital. She's talking to him from surgery. Well, tell them to sew her up! I got a ball game to run! I've gotta bat now, honey. I just wanted to hear you say you loved me from Boston. Oh, I'd love you from China. -MAN: I'll hold the phone for you. -Don't hang up. Listen to this. COMMENTATOR: Apparently, everything's as it should be, because Palmer is standing in now. Now, he's ready to go to work. (CHEERING NOISES) COMMENTATOR: Ready to go. The pitch is swung on, here's a drive, way back! -(CHEERING) -This ball is out of here! Burly! Tell her that's for her! * If you're down and confused * And you don't remember who you're talking to * Your concentration has swept away * 'Cause your baby is so far away * There's a rose in a fisted glove * And the eagle flies with the dove * And if you can't be with the one you love, honey * Love the one you're with * Love the one you're with * Love the one you're with * Love the one you're with * Don't be angry, don't be sad * And don't sit crying over good times you've had * There's a girl sitting right next to you * And she's just waiting for something to do * Well, there's a rose in a fisted glove * And the eagle flies with the dove * And if you can't be with the one you love, honey * Love the one you're with (APPLAUDING AND CHEERING) (DARRYL WHOOPING) DARRYL: Terrific! I mean, terrific! You got a hold of that song, honey. It's out of the ballpark. Here, these are for you. What are you doing here in Boston? I thought you were in Los Angeles. No, I left this morning. I'm on my way to Atlanta. DEBBY: How am I supposed to concentrate on my work when you're popping up everywhere? I'm romantic. Damn, I'm trying to cut down. Darryl, you've got to stop this. I'm working now. Do you understand what I'm saying to you? You and I got five hits in the double-header yesterday. Oh, you don't listen to me! You don't listen to me when I sing, you don't listen to me when I talk. Why don't you ever listen to me? So, when are you going back to work? Uh, soon. Well, not right away. Darryl wants me to travel with him for a little bit. COMMENTATOR: The 0-1 on the way. Swung on, driven deep left field! That ball is way back. -It's out of here! Home run! -WOMAN: Yay! (CHEERING AND WHISTLING) He hit one about 450 feet, and the Braves lead it 6-2. MAN: Thanks, Darryl, that's awfully sweet of you. Go on, get your own stewardess. Hey, babe, here's your coffee. They heated up a bun for you. Oh, I'm not hungry, Darryl. Well, they made it special. Just taste it. (SIGHS) I don't want it. Just open it up and smell it. You won't believe it. In 27 years around baseball, I've never seen a man so crazy about a woman. How come your wife never comes to the games, Burly? Well, Marie put in her time in the big leagues. She went to law school after sitting around watching me for five years. Saved the marriage. Smart woman. What's wrong, honey? I don't know. I can't travel on trips like this all the time, Burly. I can't come out to the ballpark every day. What about kids? You talking about having any yet? I just don't feel like being tied down to anything right now. But you do love him? Oh, of course, I love him. It's just all the responsibility. I mean, some days he comes home without getting a base hit, I think maybe, I did something wrong. Luckily he hasn't been having many days like that. No, but I have. I mean, some days I feel like I want a hit of my own. (CROWD CHEERING, WHISTLING) COMMENTATOR: It's into deep left field, back toward the wall... She's gone! Another home run for Darryl Palmer. That's Palmer's sixth in the last ten games. Boy, is he ever on a streak! So if you went to work again, who would you work with? That... -Gary? -Gary, right. You ever hear from him? I spoke to him last week. You spoke to him, or you saw him? I saw him. We worked together last Thursday afternoon at his place. We're trying to write some new songs. Didn't we agree that I would work after your season was over? That's our agreement. We agreed on that. (SIGHS) (GRUNTS) * Find us a better way * There's still a lot that we both can learn * All that we hoped we'd be * Someone's fantasy * Just took a funny turn (CAR DOOR SHUTS) -Hi. -Hi! I was gonna go for some chili with Manny and Tina. Gave you a call, nobody was home. I got worried, thought something might be wrong. Nothing was wrong. Oh. Uh, where were you, at your sister's? I was at Moon Shadows. They called me and asked if I wanted to do a guest appearance. Just one show, so I figured it'd be just for one night, and I really felt like doing it, so I said yes! Hey... Why not? How'd it go? It went great. I mean, I was a little rusty at first, but it felt great to be singing in front of an audience again. That's great. I'm real glad, hon. When did they call you? Today? No, a week ago. A week ago? You never said anything. Well, I didn't know how you'd feel about it. I mean, I didn't want to upset you or anything. Upset me? Why would I be upset? It's just for one night. So you didn't see the game? I saw the first three innings. I was supposed to go on at 8:00, and I didn't get on until 9:00... (CLATTERING) Well, how'd it go? The game? Lost it, 5-4 in the tenth. -(POURING) -Oh, I'm sorry. Sounds like a heart-breaker. Yeah, Burly's out walking the highway and trying to get hit by a car. You want anything to eat? I'm sorry I didn't see the game, Darryl. You didn't miss much. I went 0-for-5. Struck out three times. Left five men on base. Two in the bottom of the tenth. I'm real tired. Gonna turn in. You're angry with me, aren't you? Angry? No! Why would I be angry with you? You weren't the one who left five men on base. Sure I was. If I'm the one hitting all those home runs with you, then I left five men on base tonight too. I said I'm sorry, Darryl. I can't watch every game! I had a chance to work for one night. It was important to me! Hey, I'm glad you did it. I swear. At least there was someone in this family gave Atlanta something to cheer about tonight. (SIGHS) (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) Hey, Darryl, that phone is out of order. Debby just called the front office. She says she loves you and go out and have a big game. Now, let's go. She didn't call, did she, Burly? She's out shopping, she's out spending your money, she's having her hair... What the hell is the difference? (EXHALES) -I think I'm losing her, Burly. -No way! I mean, she's nuts about you. Listen, I know more about broads than I do about baseball. Now, what do you say? Let's go. Go. Atta baby! (EXHALES) -COMMENTATOR: There's a line drive deep left field! -Shit! This one is outta here! DEBBY: Of course I saw the game. I'm at my sister's. She just got the flu again. No, it's nothing serious. I miss you too. I'm leaving right now. Yeah, I'll see you soon. So it's your decision. They'll give you the record contract, but they want eight new songs, and the best place to get them ready is out on the road. I can get the band together, but we've got to start soon. How much time do I have to make up my mind? Until I finish my beer. (INDISTINCT LOUD CHATTERING) Hey, take it easy, man! If you don't give me a chance to hit, they pay me no money next year! Didn't you ever feel guilty about not being there every day for Burly? Sure... A little. I felt a lot guiltier about not being there every day for me. All my life I wanted the right man to come along and love me. And then the right man comes along, only he gives me more love than I can handle. Have you discussed that with him? (SIGHS) What do I say? "Please don't love me so much?" "Give me a little room to breathe?" (CHUCKLES) That's a fair enough thing to ask. COMMENTATOR: Darryl Palmer has just hit number 52. He's now nine away from Maris. Boy, they love this guy. He really jacked the high fast ball. Hit it right out of here. (CROWD WHISTLING, CHEERING) That's his second home run today. Just another day at the office for Darryl Palmer. Way to go, Darryl. REPORTER: Darryl, what do you hear from Roger Maris? DARRYL: Well, Maris says, "Send over a case of Budweiser," And told me to get a haircut. (LAUGHTER) REPORTER 2: How does it feel? I like pulling the ball, but I can go with it too. I just feel real good right now. Darryl, you've got just 26 games left. 19 of 'em are left at the launching pad. That gotta be great for you. I think so. I'd like to do it here. I'd like to do it for the fans. (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) Burly, you've managed this guy for six years now. What's the difference between this Darryl Palmer and the one who hit only 17 home runs all last year? About 35 more home runs. Yeah, but is it you? Nah. Nah, I'm not doing anything any different. Well, what is it? Well, he settled down. He married this terrific girl. Listen, if I'd met her first, I'd have hit the 52 home runs. (LAUGHTER) Only, I don't think I'd have been able to make it around the bases. (LAUGHTER) (HOMER BARKING) Hey, Homer, how you doing, boy? Get this one. Get it! It's going outta the park! And it's another great catch by Homer, the barking outfielder, folks, and he saves the pennant for the Braves. Where's mama? Making us dinner or what? Hey, Deb, did you see the game? Hit 51... Fifty-two. Right in the left field stands. It's all for you, babe. Deb! Where are you, woman? Homer... Where's the old lady, huh? She making us dinner or not? What did you say, hon? DEBBY: Nothing. DARRYL: What did you do today? DEBBY: I bought a new suitcase. DARRYL: Yeah? Should have told me. I get them for free. (GRUNTS) Damn, my shoulder hurts. Doc said I should rest it, but I just don't think I can with two weeks left in the season. Darryl... I think there's something we'd better talk about. I'm gonna use the Jacuzzi, hon. If I don't loosen this up, I'm not gonna get the bat off my shoulder tomorrow. You are going to be at the game, aren't you? I mean, none of us can afford to miss any more games from now until the playoffs, okay? (CROWD APPLAUDING, CHEERING) DARRYL: All right, all right. HAWKER: Ice cold Coca-Cola. Debby, wait! Debby... What is it? Nothing. Is it another woman? -(SIGHS) -(HAWKER YELLING) How many times a day do you speak with Manny? I don't tell him where I'm going, but he finds out where I am! -Okay! -I've just got this leash on me, Tina. The biggest leash I've ever seen! Okay, so at least you know he cares about you. That's not caring, Tina. That's not caring. That's owning. I'm desperate. I've got to get out of here now before there's nothing left of me. Sure, when the season is over, you can have a few days apart... No, not when the season's over. Now. COMMENTATOR: We're ready to go. The pitch is good. Kind of a half-swing. He chopped at the ball. -You're out! -He's gonna be thrown out at first. Palmer started the season in good shape, hit the ball hard, but of late, he's been having problems. He's two for his last 18. He seems to be distracted today. He's in a bit of a slump. Of course, the Braves hope he'll pull out of it. -Strike! -Something's got his attention. He's taking an awful lot of strikes lately, and that's very unlike Darryl Palmer. Strike! Once again, Pete pumped right across the middle. Nothing and two, the count on Darryl Palmer still looking for his first hit of this game. And the 0-2 pitch on the way. Strike three swinging. Palmer out of there on strikes again. And he swung very, very late and... Well, as the Braves go... Uh-oh, this is embarrassing. That's three strikes, Palmer! ...goes down on strikes. Add a little embarrassment to this moment. He was right at the plate. He struck out and didn't realize that was strike three swinging. He was right in the batter's box, and they told him, "Hey, you only get three strikes in this league." Lost track of the count somewhere, so Palmer remains mired in that slump, striking out again. That'll bring up England. MAN: Next time, babe, next time. -It's all right. -It's okay, baby, shake it off. It's all right, Darryl. It's all right. It's all right. (REMOVING GLOVES) BURLY: Settle down, Darryl. (SLAMS DOOR) COMMENTATOR: England takes a strike. Nothing and one, the count. (BATS THROWN AROUND IN LOCKER ROOM) COMMENTATOR: The 0-1 pitch on the way to England. He takes a ball high and away. Maybe Palmer can snap out of it. England swings and misses! He's down on strikes. So the Braves are again not hitting. They're having big, big problems scoring runs. No runs, and no hits, no errors, none left. Let's go. Let's hustle. COMMENTATOR: We go to the top half of the seventh. It's 3-0, San Diego. (TIRES SQUEALING) * When I need you * I just close my eyes and I'm with you * And all that I so want to give you... "I pray it's not forever... "But I guess that depends on how we handle it." Oh, God. (SNIFFLING) (EXHALES) (SIGHS) If a woman wants out... A man's got a right to know. Am I right, Home? Homer... Don't you fall for no good-looking cocker spaniels. Don't ever get married. They're only interested in their careers. Am I wrong? * When I need you * I just close my eyes and I'm with you * And all that I so want to give you... -(TIRES SQUEALING) All right, all right, go ahead. -(SHUTS CAR DOOR) -(HOMER WHIMPERING) -(BARKS) -Oh. (GLASS SHATTERING) * I hold out my hands and I touch you * I never knew there was so much love * Keeping me warm night and day I want you to turn on the lights. But they're on already, Mr. Palmer. Not those lights. The lights in the stadium! What stadium? The Atlanta Braves' stadium. Where the Atlanta Braves play! -(LAUGHING DELIRIOUSLY) -Okay. Can't practice without lights, can I? Well, but I can't turn on them lights unless I have permission from the management. You want to win the pennant, don't you? How can we win the pennant if I don't get in my batting practice? -I'm in a slump. -Mmm-hmm. I haven't hit a home run since last night. Yeah, well... Now, you, are gonna turn on the lights, God damn it! Mr. Palmer, don't do that. Hey, I'll lose my job! Now, you know you don't want me to lose my job, do you? (STADIUM SHUTTER OPENING) * When I need love DARRYL: Yeah, baby! * I hold out my hands and I touch love... -(BALL PITCHING) -Shit. Inside, inside. Ball was way inside. Am I right, Homer? Al, who's been screwing with the machine? That's supposed to be a fastball! (GRUNTS) New pitcher. New pitcher. Just got to get used to his motion. Darryl, what the hell's the matter with you! You crazy, or something? I can hit this guy, Burly. Don't worry about it. I got his number. What's happening, man? You know who's gonna have to pay for these lights, don't you? I haven't been rehired for next year yet. Give me a break! It's in the bag, Burly. We got the pennant sewed up. -(LOUDLY) Ten more homers! -Man, he is wasted. I'm in the record book! Ahead of Ruth and Maris! BURLY: Let us take you home, kid. Come on, Al. I can hit this guy. Put the bat down, Darryl. You're not even warmed up! -(GRUNTS) -Come on, Darryl, let's go sleep it off. No. Did you tell her what I hit in triple-A ball, Burly? .365 average. 34 home runs. I didn't even know she was alive. -BURLY: Put the bat down, Darryl. It's cold. -(GRUNTS) You're gonna hurt your shoulder the last two weeks of the season. He thinks I can't hit him. I can hit any pitcher alive. I'll drop it down his throat, Al. Let's go! BURLY: Come on, Darryl! DARRYL: Faster, come on! Throw it faster. BURLY: She's coming back. Let us take you home, kid. DARRYL: Once I get my timing, you're dead. I'm gonna break your batteries, hot shot! BURLY: Stop it, Darryl! Stop it! I mean, think of the team! Just think of the team! Who's she thinking of? Is she thinking of the team? She doesn't give a shit if we win or lose! Just put her on stage singing for some assholes that aren't even listening! -Am I right, Burly? -Sure, kid, sure. I don't need her! I don't need her! BURLY: Cut it out, kid! (SCREAMING) (DOG WHIMPERS) * When I need you (APPLAUSE) I won't last three days without her. I'll die without her. If you die, I'm gonna hire a gay ballplayer. I mean, I don't wanna go through this anymore. Gays fall in love too, you know. With outfielders, with second baseman! At least he'll fall in love with somebody on the team! If she calls, will you wake me? Of course I'll wake you. What am I gonna do, take a message? Manny, get a chair, go to sleep right next to his door. (SNORING) -Wake him up. -(CHUCKLING) I always wondered about Manny. Last one out of the shower and all. -Did you ever notice that? -BURLY: Yup. Hey, Darryl! Is there any news? BURLY: She's in Kansas City. She opens there tonight. Call the airline. Get me on the next plane. BURLY: She won't talk to you. How do you know? BURLY: She told me. She doesn't want to be followed. She wants time to figure out what she's gonna do with her life. We're all entitled to live our own lives, Darryl. Well, where's she staying? If I could just talk to her for five minutes, that's all I need. I can get her back. I know it. If you call her, she'll run so fast, and so far, you'll never be able to catch her. When she's ready, she'll call you. What if she never calls? Well, then you'll have to step into the box and stand on your own two feet. It's Darryl Palmer batting fourth tonight... Not Mr. and Mrs. DEBBIE: We've gotta clean up that second verse. GARY: I got some ideas. Let's eat first, huh? DEBBIE: Darryl... -Let's get out of here. -No, just stay right there. Look, why don't we talk about this, huh? DARRYL: I beg your pardon? What is it you want? Well, I'll have a small OJ, two eggs over, crisp bacon, black coffee and some whole wheat toast. You know what? She called me. I never called her. Gary... She's the one that wants out. Now, if you think she wants to go back with you now, why don't you go ask her. You know what my bet is? Maybe I'm wasting my time here. Maybe I'm on of them jealous, dumb husbands that just doesn't... Maybe you're right. Listen, would you just give Deb a message for me? Sure. (GRUNTS) Tell her I apologize for having to smash in your face. Hey, man, why don't you just relax and take it easy? Why don't you take a walk, Slim. This is a family matter. Don't do this to me, Darryl. Please. I'm not gonna touch you, Deb. I'm not gonna lay a finger on you. You don't need me. I'm not your strength. I'm not your good luck charm. I'm not a gold locket around your neck. I don't want to be responsible anymore. I thought we loved each other. DEBBIE: I do love you, Darryl. There's no one else in the world but you. But to be with you, I have to give up everything that I am. I don't want much. I just want to be able to sing a song that means something to me. Tell me it's all right to have my own life. Please tell me, because even if you don't, I'm taking it anyway. Okay. Okay, no problem. You can't go back. That's easy enough to understand. You just let me know where you are, so I can send you the rest of your things. Just one thing, though. You were never a good luck charm to me. You were never a gold locket around my neck. You're my wife! I loved you more than I ever loved any woman. I hit that ball for you as far as I could, because that's the only gift that I could give to you. I wanted these next few years so I could quit this game with you as proud as hell of me, because it's gotta last me the rest of my life, and I'll tell you what. With or without you, that ball is going to fly out of the park tonight and tomorrow and every day until I get the World Series ring on my finger and 62 home runs in the record book! Ten more, that's all I need! You count 'em! One! Two! Three! Four! BURLY: You owe damages to a coffee shop, a guitar player, three airplane tickets, bail money... And a $2,500 disciplinary fine. If I so much as hear you passing gas, you'll be playing in Omaha next year. Did you get rid of her? Yeah, I got rid of her. Good. Screw her. No disrespect. BURLY: You and Manny are taking the night off. Oh, we're not playing? How come? If he goes to the plate five times without getting a hit, he's gonna be convinced he can't do it without her. Get him drunk, and when he's good and pissed, I want him laid. -Laid? -Yeah, three or four times. BURLY: Get all the anxiety out of him. Get a few young girls. Strong, healthy, good-looking. Tell him he's doing it for the team if he says he's tired. If he still says he's tired, tell him he's doing it again for the team. The city of Atlanta is behind him. Do you think it'll work? BURLY: Well, a guy that's just been laid three times is a lot looser than a guy who's wife has just left him. We're in the hands of the gods, kid. What about girls for me and Manny? When's that last time you hit a home run? I'm a manager, not a pimp! (STRAY CAT STRUT PLAYING) * Black and orange stray cat sitting on a fence * Ain't got enough dough to pay the rent * What the hell is this? You guys are up at bat in five minutes. We got the night off. Dislocated hand. Yeah, which one of you? All three. We're very close. * I strut right by with my tail in the air * Stray cat strut I'm a gentleman's cat * She's not that beautiful, you know? I mean, when you get up close. I mean, real, real close. You can see pores in her skin. You put your eyeball up on her cheek, those pores, they're as big as cantaloupes. She's cute. That's the most I ever thought she was, was cute. She used to be. They lose that fast, you know? Cuteness. That's one of the first things that goes. You know what the second thing is that goes? Their tits? * Ain't got enough dough to pay the rent * I'm flat broke but I don't care * I strut right by with my tail in the air * I've still got a good ass. You got a good ass. Moose has got a good ass. Moose has a great ass, man. Best one on the team. All right, there you are. So what the hell do we need her for? Especially since we've got our asses. Maybe, just maybe she's got one tiny little thing left. I mean, it ain't even worth mentioning. It's nothing. It's all that dumb chick has got left to her name. What's that? I goddamn love her. * I wish I could be as carefree and wild * MOOSE: Darryl? (CLEARS THROAT) I got a couple of girls here that want to meet you. -This is Paloma, -Hi. -and Sherry... -Hi, there. -And Peggy. -How you doing? -Debby? -Peggy. I thought you said Debby. I don't like that name, Debby. They're usually not there when you get home. I'm just the opposite. I usually am. -That's great. -(LAUGHTER) -Oh, why don't, why don't we find out? -Find out what? Why don't we go home to Darryl's place and find out if you're there. Sure, that'd be interesting. All right. Let's go, girls. Manny, grab his arm. Where we going? We got to get you laid. Burly's orders. I don't wanna get laid. Don't make me get laid, Manny. My heart's not in it. Your heart ain't even gonna get near it. I wouldn't make you get laid if you didn't want to. Moose? * I'm flat broke but I don't care at all * Mrowr! (THE MEN ALL PAUSE BY KLYMAXX PLAYING) Is that too loud? I'll see what's going on. * I was at home feelin' sleazy * So I went down to the speak easy * As soon as my feet hit the door * I had all attention from the dance floor * Don't you know the men all pause * when I walked into the room * The men all pause * The men all pause * and the brides held their grooms * The men all pause * and the all sang the same old tune * Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa * (KNOCKING GENTLY) Darryl? Is everything okay? Can I come in? It's never gonna change. MOOSE: What's happening here? Ain't you two made it yet? He won't let me take my bra and panties off. How the hell are we gonna make it? Peggy, could you wait downstairs a minute? Darryl and I have to have a talk. PEGGY: What kind of talk? This man only knows one subject. Her name is Debby. (CHUCKLES) (SIGHS) Darryl... -Moose. -I'm gonna level with you. This is my last year in the bigs. I'm hanging them up after this season. * The men all pause * And the brides held their grooms * The men all pause She's gone, Darryl. She's not coming back. Not in the next ten days, she's not. Now, unless you loosen up. Unless you get the confidence that you can do it up there by yourself. I try, Moose. Downstairs are three of the most fantastic women I ever saw. They're yours. I guarantee it. One hour with those girls, you won't even blink if I mention the name Debby. I used to do it before. I was pretty good with the ladies, wasn't I, Moose? (CHUCKLES) You were the best. You know, we had a list of 200 volunteers for tonight. Do it for me, Darryl. For my old age. Screw one for the Moose. I'd screw anybody for you, bud. You know that. (CHUCKLES) (LAUGHTER) You son-of-a-bitch. I could cry. Now, get your clothes off. Which one should I send up first? Not in here. This is where Debby and I make love. (SIGHS) What about the spare bedroom? Oh, no, we did it in there, too. Living room? Den? Wherever you want. Kitchen was the only place we never did it. Then it's the kitchen. (CLICKS TONGUE) Let's go, kid. (MUSIC STOPS ABRUPTLY) (EL RANCHO GRANDE BY FREDDY FENDER PLAYING) He's ready. He's ready. (SINGING IN SPANISH) I'm sorry if I offended any of you ladies. No problem. We understand. It's okay, honey. -Debby. -Peggy. Sorry. Where we going, the kitchen? Those counters are always so damn cold. I'll see you guys. Hey, amigo, we owe you one. This one's for the pennant, guys. I can't. That's our kitchen. Debby cooked in that kitchen! I'm sorry, Moose. I'm sorry. Please forgive me. I just can't do it. DARRYL: Homer, come on, we're going to bed. MOOSE: What about the cellar? I bet you never did it in the cellar. We tried, Burly. We really did. The kid's got character. I hate kids with character. They never listen to me. (SHOUTING PLAYFULLY) Oh, you had it, you had it, old man! Get your ass outta there. MAN: Hey! Oh, boy! MAN 2: Come on, baby, show them how it's done. DARRYL: Tom... Put something on it. I need my timing. Watch it! Let him get some air. Give him some room. Darryl! Darryl, talk to me. (GROANS) Debby? He'll be all right. At least he got her name right. DARRYL: Nurse, are there any calls for me? Who's that? Hiya, kid. How you doing? Oh, Burly. I didn't recognize you. They got the lights off in here? Hi, Darryl. It's Moose. Hiya, Moose. -Who's that with you? -WOMAN: (OVER PA) Dr. Hill... That's me, too. You got double vision, kid. I know. It was murder peeing in the bottle. Hi, Darryl. It's Burly. Can you see me? Two fat guys like you? Who could miss you? Doc says you're doing fine. I mean, he says you might be able to play tomorrow night. Would you like to give it a shot? Let's face it, Burly, I'm just holding the team back. Why don't you bring up that kid from Richmond. Give him a chance. At least he won't see two balls coming at him. Would you stop talking like that? Manny, tell him not to talk like that. Don't talk like that. I mean, I don't care who wins the pennant, or even the goddamn World Series. Nobody remembers who won it last year anyway. It was Baltimore. I care about you. My boys always come first. Now, get well, will you? When you're ready, you're ready. If not, we'll get the bastards next year. (SINGING SUMMER IN THE CITY BY THE LOVIN' SPOONFUL) * Hot town summer in the city * Back of my neck getting dirty and gritty * Been down isn't it a pity * Who's that? Oh, that's Aline Cooper. She's a real nice kid. She's been working here about three years now. No kiddin'. You guys think she's pretty? Yeah, sure. You want me to try and fix you up, Burly? Her boyfriend plays tackle for the Oilers. -He'll break your ribs, but I can ask. -(LAUGHTER) Squint your eyes and look at her. * In the summer in the city * Cool town evening in the city * Dressing so fine and looking so pretty * Cool cat looking for a kitty * Gonna look in every corner of the city * Till I'm wheezing like a bus stop * Running up the stairs gonna meet you on the rooftop * But tonight it's a different world * Ain't it nice just to be a girl * Come on, come on and dance all night * She look anything like Debby? Not much. Yeah, maybe just a little. Well, squint harder. Make her look fuzzy. Oh, yeah. Yeah, she looks like Debby now. She looks like anyone now. If I pull this thing off, I'm going to run for mayor next year. (MUSIC PLAYING) * Hot town summer in the city * Back of my neck getting dirty and gritty * (ELEVATOR BEEPS) Sometimes she wears her hair in a twist. -What? -A twist! Twist? I'm twisting. I'm twisting. -Everything's gonna be all right. -I'm nervous. Oh, come on. I don't know whether I can go through with this. Damn swell fellow laying in there. Think of how happy you're gonna make him. Come on. Hiya, Darryl. It's Burly. Burly? BURLY: How are the eyes? Not bad. BURLY: How many fingers am I holding up? -Two. -BURLY: Good boy. There's somebody here to see you, Darryl. It's Debby. -Debby? -Debby. Debby's here? Right there in that chair. She came in from Toronto. How about that, kid? Deb? Is that you? (WHISPERING) Yes, Darryl, it's me. DARRYL: You sound so funny. It's laryngitis. I mean, she can hardly speak. I told her not to come, but she wanted to see you. You're so far away. Can you come closer? BURLY: The doctors told her not to. In case she's contagious. They don't want you to develop any complications I don't care. It would be worth it. I'm gonna leave you alone for a minute. I can see you kids want to talk. DARRYL: I'm real sorry about that day in Kansas City. I was out of my mind. You know I'd never do anything to hurt you. I know, Darryl. Do you? Do you really? Yeah. I'm letting you go, Deb, but I'm not angry about it. I'm real scared. But I'm not angry about it, and whatever happens, that's what's meant to happen. Even if I wasn't your wife right now, I'd love you. Gee... I'm real glad to hear you say that, Deb. Because you know what? More than anything in the world... I won't be seeing you till after the season's over, Darryl. You're coming back after the season? I'm coming back, Darryl. I promise you I'm coming back. Hold my hand a minute. Darryl, the doctors said I wasn't... I don't care about the doctors. Hold my hand. You're so cold. Usually you're so warm. ALINE: I've gotta go. You take care, now, you hear? How did it go, kid? She's said she's coming back, Burly. You think she really means it? What have I always been telling you? Think positive. -Nice going, kid. -Get away from me. Don't you touch me. I must have been crazy coming here letting you talk me into this. I thought I was coming here to cheer someone up, not to break that man's heart, because that's what's gonna happen to him if his wife doesn't come back to him real soon. Well, I'm not gonna let you get away with it, because as soon as he's out of this hospital, I'm telling somebody what I did, and who put me up to it, and don't you try and stop me, or I'll have it on the 6:00 news as fast as you can talk out both sides of your mouth. You think she's right? You think I did wrong? BOTH: Yeah. You think I'm a son-of-a-bitch? BOTH: Yeah. But if we win the pennant because of what I did tonight, you still think I'm wrong? No freaking way. Damn right! Let's get going, we've got a game tomorrow. ANNOUNCER: A standing ovation at Atlanta Fulton County stadium for Darryl Palmer. Boy, what a year he's had. He had a big slump for a while. But then he rebounded. Hello, Debby? It's Aline Cooper. Aline! Hi! How you doing? I got something to tell you, and I'm not going to get a night's sleep till I tell somebody about it. ALINE: (OVER PHONE) Well, last night, when I finished off my set, Moose and Manny were backstage with that manager, Burly... And so they told me they were going off to the hospital to see Darryl, and they wanted to know if I wanted to come with them to cheer him up. I thought, "Wow, what a great idea." Because I know that, you know, the pennant's coming close, and I got changed and I went off with them to the hospital in their car, and once we got in the car on the way to the hospital, they announced to me what they really had in mind, and how they really wanted me to cheer him up was for me to pretend that I was you. Yeah... So then they also wanted me to say that I was still in love with him, and that I was coming back. So I did it... COMMENTATOR: (ON TV) Breaking ball. There's the drive, way back! And, uh, I know. I know. Wow! I must be a hell of an actress, because Darryl just hit a whopper of a home run! He's hitting again! BURLY: I'm smart! I'm smart! I'm rotten, but I'm smart! BURLY: Atta way to go, kid. Atta way to go! I don't know why I did it. COMMENTATOR: (ON TV) Boy, they love this guy. I just wanted you guys to get back together so bad. Oh, Aline, I don't know if I wouldn't have done the same thing if I was you. I mean, if it's working, it's working.

Hey, Moose. Hey, Darryl, you gonna make history tomorrow or what? -I don't know. I'm gonna try, Chuck. -Good luck, buddy. Mr. Palmer. Hi. Lloyd Parker, Sports Illustrated, down here to cover the game. I wonder if I can just ask you a few questions? DARRYL: Sure, Lloyd, just make it fast. I'm not staying too long. The Braves have won six out of their last eight games. You guys probably figured you had it all wrapped up. How do you feel about Houston winning all eight of their last games? DARRYL: Well, what the hell, Lloyd, winning isn't everything. It's coming close that counts. Okay, well, what about breaking Roger Maris's home run record, 61 home runs. You need just one more. Do you really think you can do it? Hey, man, don't ask questions like that. It's all right, Manny. Yeah, I think I can do it. I don't know if I'm going to, I don't know if I will. Yeah, I think I can do it. Yeah, I think you can too, and I hope you do. Hey, Darryl, thanks a lot for talking to me. I appreciate it. Good luck tomorrow. Okay, Lloyd. Thanks. * I held my nose I closed my eyes * I took a drink * I didn't know if it was day or night * I started kissing everything in sight * But when I kissed a cop down at 34th and Vine * What's the matter, Darryl? Your eyes bothering you? I don't know. Something's wrong, though. Debby... Shit, I told you we shouldn't have come here. * But when I kissed a cop down on 34th and Vine * He broke my little bottle of * Love potion number nine * Love potion number nine * Love potion number nine * Love potion number nine * (APPLAUSE) (MUSIC PLAYING) -Hey, Aline. -Hey, Darryl. Can I talk to you for a minute? -Sure. -Hi. Hey, nice show, fellas. Thank you, Darryl. Oh, so how you doing? -Fine. -Good. How's Kyle? Oh, real good. I think they've got a shot at the Super Bowl this year. Yeah, I figure they do. Have you heard from Deb lately? Debby? No, not in a long time. You always wear that perfume? As long as I can remember. Is it all right? It's great. I was just wondering where I might have smelt it before. Oh, everywhere in Atlanta probably. It's really popular. I've gotta go, Darryl. Hey, good luck tomorrow. I really think you deserve to get everything you want. Hey, Aline, that's not how we say "Good luck" in Atlanta. You know that. We shake hands. Kiss lips. I'm glad your lips ain't as cold as your hands. Darryl, it wasn't my idea. MOOSE: Darryl, wait a minute. Leave me alone, God damn it! -I'm going to kill that son-of-a-bitch! -MOOSE: No, Darryl. No! It wasn't Debby, was it? It was Aline, wasn't it? It wasn't Debby, it was Aline! Why did he do that, Moose? Why? The team. He was thinking of the team. What if we lost once in a while? Wouldn't people still like us? No, I don't think so. Well, God damn it, that's depressing! Were you guys in on it, too? Aw, Christ... That is even more depressing! We'll make it up to you, Darryl. I'd break my ass for you, man, you know that. I ain't promising nothing. When I go up to the plate tomorrow, I'll take my cuts. Just in case, do you want to go to church? Hello, Darryl. Hi. I called earlier to tell you I'd be coming by. There was no answer. Hope you don't mind my letting myself in? DARRYL: No. Why should I mind? Well, I didn't know if you'd be having guests over or not. No, no guests. Just me and Homer. Big day tomorrow. DEBBY: I know. I wanted to see the game. They're not showing it in Philadelphia. Oh, would you like to go? -I know you don't like... -No, I'd like to go very much. Thank you. DARRYL: Oh, I'll leave an extra ticket at the gate. I've been following the games in the papers. I'm really happy to see you doing so good, and you've been doing it by yourself. I mean, no good luck charms around your neck or around the house. It must feel good to know that. Did Aline tell you about that... Little joke Burly played on me in the hospital that night? DEBBY: Yeah, she told me. Didn't look or sound or smell like you. I was hoping so... I'd have believed anything that night. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Hell, what for? It worked. And that's all that matters, isn't it? Darryl, there's something I'd like to say. DARRYL: Don't. Please don't say anything. When I go to the ballpark tomorrow, I don't want to know what's waiting for me when I come back. I don't want to depend on you or what I'm hoping for. I want to play this last game by myself. Can you understand that, Deb? Yeah, I understand that, Darryl. Why don't you stay here tonight. Me and Homer will use the guest room. I've got to get up early and go to batting practice, so I probably won't see you before I go. You look real good. Did you put on some weight or did you lose some? I'm about the same. No... Not the same. I don't think either one of us is the same anymore. Night. I could try to relax you and say it's just another ball game. Well, it's not just another ball game. It's the most important goddamn game we'll ever play in our lives! And winning, it means not only pride and achievement and respect... But endorsements and TV appearances. BURLY: Okay, now, let's play this game for the most important thing in this man's world, big bucks! COMMENTATOR: He's got it. That's all for the Astros in the top half of the second. Nothing across for Houston. We go to the bottom half of inning two, still scoreless in Atlanta. Boy, so much pressure in this game. Obviously, the pennant will be decided today, and Darryl Palmer who will lead off the bottom of the second inning, 61 home runs. He's tied Maris' record. In this final game, he needs one more to set a new all-time record for most home runs. You wonder, Pete, what these fans want most. They want a Braves win, and they want Palmer to set the record. ANNOUNCER: Number four, Atlanta's pride and joy, right fielder Darryl Palmer. COMMENTATOR: So it'll be Darryl Palmer leading off here in the bottom half of the second inning. 61 home runs. The media here from all other the nation covering not only this game, but this attempt of Darryl Palmer's... CROWD: Palmer! Palmer! Palmer! COMMENTATOR: All the Braves in the very front of their dugout as Palmer digs in. UMPIRE: Time! -So it's Palmer facing veteran left-hander Al Hrabosky. -UMPIRE: Play ball. As we go to the bottom half of the second inning, no score. -And the first pitch is taken for a called strike. -Strike! Nothing and one, the count. Bottom of the second, no score. Pitch number two. He missed it, 0 and two. Boy, he had that home run cut, though. That's the cut that has hit 61 home runs this year. Tied Roger Maris' long-standing record. Everybody standing at Atlanta Fulton County Stadium. That's it! COMMENTATOR: Now Palmer back in. Hrabosky ahead in the count. No balls and two strikes. And Hrabosky ready with an 0-2. It's on the way. There's a drive deep left field! This might be it! Everybody on their feet. This ball is way back in the blue seats beyond Noc-A-Homa Teepee. And Roger Maris move over, make room for Darryl Palmer who has just hit number 62, setting an all-time Major League record. We'll remember this day. Baseball's never seen this before. The 62nd home run in one season. Darryl Palmer has done it, as he's done it so many times this year and here on the day when the pennant will be decided. MAN: Nice going, Darryl! A remarkable performance by a remarkable player, Darryl Palmer. The big scene is at home plate, we've got an illustrious group of Atlanta Braves congratulating Darryl Palmer for entering the record books with his 62nd home run of the year. I'm sure he'll have to make a curtain call for this one, the fans are not going to let Darryl just walk back into that dugout without getting a better look at him than they have right now. Boy, even though it's the second inning, everyone spills out of the dugout to welcome Palmer, like the game and the season was over. Burly DeVito now hugging Palmer right in front of the dugout. England is back into the wall, but this ball is outta here. Home run! Powell has just homered to deep left center field. Hrabosky getting his sign. Plato getting his lead at first. Getting a good lead over there. And the pitch on the way. -UMPIRE: Ball! -Takes it high. Runner going. -You're out! -The throw down. Plato will be outta there at second base. Whoa, tempers a little hot down at second, but this'll be handled. The umpire stepping in to break things up. There's a bouncer to short. He didn't have a very good swing. Short to first. -Perfect. -You're out! The pitch. Curve ball. Swing and a miss. DeVito with the classic sign at the Braves' dugout, there goes Pachter, a throw down at second base, and he's in there safely. The 0-1 on the way. Line drive. They've got a chance for two. UMPIRE: You're out! Pachter, a swing and a miss. Looking for a throw, Johnson back easily. There's a drive, deep right center field. Palmer back. He's... Got it on the track! What a catch! Shit! Well, the Braves are down to their final chance. Two men out, bottom half of the ninth inning. Houston with a 2-1 lead. Manny Alvarado, the batter. -WOMAN: Atta boy, Manny! -He is 0-for-three today. He's popped out twice, and grounded out hard to third his last time up. Now Hrabosky just one out away from eliminating Atlanta from the National League West Pennant. The pitch on the way to Alvarado. He slaps one toward right field. It's in for a base hit. Alvarado will take the turn at first and hold on. The Braves are still alive. Alvarado with pretty good speed at first base as Darryl Palmer comes up, but he won't be doing any running. ANNOUNCER: Number four, right fielder Darryl Palmer. Let's go downtown with it, baby! COMMENTATOR: There's a drive toward right. That's through for a base hit! Alvarado will round second, head for third. The throw will come back into second, and the Braves have runners at first and third with two men out for Moose Granger. ANNOUNCER: Number 24, first baseman, Moose Granger. COMMENTATOR: Now the Braves have the tying run at third and the winning run at first. CROWD: (CHANTING) Moose! Moose! Moose! Runners at first and third, two men out. First pitch to Granger. Say, Moose, what do you say, babe? Come on, Moose! COMMENTATOR: Alvarado on third, two down. The stretch by Hrabosky, and the 0-1 on the way. There's a drive deep center field Gulliver going back. Still going back. This ball is going, going... And Gulliver up against the wall to make the catch and end the season for the Atlanta Braves, and just like that this crowd is stunned into silence as Moose Granger's drive hauled in by Gulliver. Well, the Braves came so close, the tying run at third, the winning run at first. The winning run would have scored, and Granger's drive caught right at the left center field wall. And now the crowd starts to give the Braves a... A quiet, but steady ovation. They know the Braves came that close to winning it all. (MUSIC PLAYING) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) MOOSE: Damn. MANNY: Two more inches. Two more inches, he doesn't get a glove on it. DARRYL: That guy will never make a catch like that again in his life. Yeah... But he made it today. Nobody feels worse than I do. I love these guys. We'll be back. You can mortgage your homes on that. REPORTER 1: Where is he? REPORTER 2: Inside, inside. REPORTER 1: Hey, Darryl! It didn't go your way, but you broke the record. How do you feel? I wish we won, but we didn't. REPORTER 3: Darryl, after a colossal year like this, next year, do you think there's any way you could do this sort of thing again? DARRYL: I don't know. It's been a good year and a bad year. I can't think about tomorrow yet. REPORTER 3: Darryl, I know you're proud of breaking Maris' record, but does not winning the pennant take the edge off it? The edge, the center, and the sides. What do you do tonight after a game like this? Any plans? I don't know. I have to see what comes up. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Came to say goodbye, skipper. BURLY: You know what makes really good champagne? Winning. Forty dollars a bottle, it tastes like Mountain Dew. Winning isn't everything, Burly. It comes damn close. Well, we couldn't have gotten here without you, kid. I mean, Christ, you're in the Hall of Fame. How does it feel? Damn good. Is that wrong, Burly? I'm in the Hall of Fame, but we lost the pennant. Does that make me a selfish bastard? A little... But you're human, like the rest of us. Here's a Mountain Dew to you. I'll see you. Darryl... Sorry about that night in the hospital. The hell you are. DEBBY: Darryl... Hi. Hi. DEBBY: How do you feel? Well, it hasn't been an uninteresting day. No, I suppose not. I'm glad you were here. It must have been a hell of a game to watch. I'm finally going to get to make that album. DARRYL: An album? Hey move over, Dolly Parton. Well, almost, but not quite. No, you're gonna make it. I knew it the first night I heard you. You didn't hear me. You just watched me, remember? Yeah. It's a habit that's hard to break. I'm so happy for you, Darryl. I was so proud of you today. Thanks. I like hearing that. Can I drop you anywhere? No. No, I got a rental car to get me to the airport. Oh. Okay. Keep in touch. Let me know when that album comes out before they're all sold. Darryl... I miss you like hell. I'm just so damn confused about everything, but I know that I care for you more than anything in the world. I believe that, Deb. Is there a chance we could keep the door open? I mean, is there a chance, in time, we could reconsider the... Sure. Let's keep the door open till it's time to close it. Here's that home run you hit today. The man who caught it gave it to me to give to you. In gratitude, he said. That's okay, I've got enough. Why don't you keep it? That way, in case that door is still open, you might want to bring it back with you one day. I just might do that. Goodbye, Darryl. * Love * It's just the way it goes * Forever or for just a day * Well, it's just that way * Nobody ever knows * It's just the way love goes * (CAR DRIVING AWAY) (DOG BARKING) DARRYL: Hey, Homer! Hey, boy! How you doing? Come on up here. Yeah! CHARLIE: Hey, you're gonna have to get a stronger leash if you want me to keep watching this dog, man. I mean, damn, he's strong. -Okay, thanks, Charlie. -Okay. Come here, Homer. Come here, Home. How many hot dogs did you have? You got mustard all over your face. Hey.
