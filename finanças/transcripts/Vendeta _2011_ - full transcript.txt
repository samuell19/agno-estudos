Anybody here? It needs to be sold by Friday. - But today’s Wednesday. - I know. Well, I’ll call my associate who handles fast sales. The flat’s worth six million. - Agreed. - I’ll sell it for four. - Four? - Half by Friday. The rest within two weeks. I’ve downloaded all their albums. I’ll burn them for you. Thanks. How did the history test go? Fine, I think. I studied yesterday, so... I’m screwed. I hope she’ll feel sorry for me and give me a “D.” What if she goes to the cops? I’ll just laugh in their faces then. Are you stupid? How old are you, fatso? Fourteen. The cops can’t arrest you until you’re fifteen. Get going! - Is it still far? - We’re almost there. I told Dad I’d be home after 6. You will. Hope you didn’t tell him though. No. It’ll be a surprise. - Is the photo shoot really here? - Yeah. I said it was an old factory. But this is an absolute dump! Hurry, fatso! Try to relax. My uncle will kill me if you’re uptight. You did tell him I’d never modelled before, didn’t you? - Well... - Jerk! What was I supposed to say? You would’ve lost the job. I’m doing this for you. So you can make some money. I’m sorry. But what if he can tell? He won’t. I know a few tricks. Come on. Voila! This is it! My uncle’s favourite place. - So you have to take an oath. - An oath? - To keep this a secret. - Stop making fun of me, Tomas! Repeat after me. I swear. Come on. I swear. To keep this place a secret. To keep this place a secret. Great. Now I’ll teach you how to model. - It’s a crash course. - A crash course? - Yeah. Lesson one is called “Posing and Smiling for the Camera.” - Are you my teacher now? - This is the catwalk. You’re a model. I’m a photographer. Ladies and gentlemen, here comes one of our top models. Her face, hair and body. Gorgeous. Need I say more? Bravo! You see? Great! My uncle will love it. Show me. - It cost five hundred. - So? You stole it from your Mum anyway. That’s enough! Bravo! Tell us something about yourself, please. Stop it! Don’t turn down a TV interview. - What’s your name? - Hana Pochmanova. - Age? - Fourteen. What do you want to be? Certainly not a model. That’s a shame. As soft as Moravcova’s tits. You’ve touched them? Just like everyone else. - She let you do it? - Why not? I walked up behind her and grabbed her tits like this. Do you even know how to do it? Like this. I meant fucking, you idiot! Of course I do. - Got a rubber? - Yeah. He should be here by now, shouldn’t he? He sent me a text a while ago. He’s fifteen minutes late. - Are you nervous? - A little. - Can I see? - Sure. Wow! It’s beautiful. How much did it cost? No idea. Dad gave it to me. Why do you never wear this to school? - Do you think I’m crazy? - You’d be the school’s Beauty Queen. Put it on. Now? I’ll freeze. C’mon. You can wear something over it. Where can I change here? I don't know... How about here? Or over there. Over there then. But... I’ll stay here. I promise. You’re gorgeous. What’re you doing here? I thought you might need help. Thanks. I can do it myself. Why? Are you shy in front of me? - I’m getting dressed! - Am I stopping you? Yes. I’m just looking. Would you prefer if I touched you? My uncle. Hi! We’re at that factory. Gee. Sorry. OK. We’re coming. Shit. This is the wrong place. What is it again? - You said he was here. - He is. Where’s his car then? I didn’t see it outside. I don’t know. He must’ve parked on the other side. Can I talk to him? - Are you OK? - Can I talk to him? Sure. Why not? He’s upstairs. Two floors up. Can you call him? - Is everything OK? - Just call him! Sure. - But why? He’s upstairs. - You’re such an idiot. Shit. - Wait! Don’t be crazy! - Leave me alone. - I’m not doing anything. How’ll you get home? - Don’t worry about it. You don’t know the way. Let’s go back. I’ll take you home. I’m talking to you! What would you say to me up there? That it was a joke? That I’m stupid? - You won’t treat me like this! - That hurts! We’re going back. Got it? - Let me go! - Shut up, you bitch! Hi, Mum! I’m playing football with the guys. I’ll be home late. I know I promised. But I won’t make it today. - Help! - Shut up! Shut up, you bitch! - What’s wrong? - Shit. You said she’d want it. You said you’d be tough and tape her with the phone. - I know. - Then what’s wrong? Nothing. I just thought she’d want it. She changed her mind. - How about going back home? - Shut the fuck up! We can’t chicken out now. We’ll record her with the phone. She won’t tell anyone. It’s perfect. That’s it. High five. - Won’t her Dad notice? - I don’t know. We’ll get her a motel room. She’ll call home and pull herself together. We might do her again. No turning back now. - OK. - Yeah. We’re cool. Move it, fatso! - Give me twenty minutes. - Hang on! Why are you first? Don’t you get it? Whose idea was this? Mine. And who got the car? My brother would kill me if he found out! - Fuck the car! - I’m going home now. - What? - I have to be home by five. What a load of shit! - Sorry, guys. - You want to go home, fatso? - Take off your pants. - Why? So you can jerk off. Take off your fucking pants! Hurry, you fuck! - What’re you doing? - Recording you on the phone. Why? Cause you’re a fucker who breaks promises. - I’ll play it for the whole school in the morning. - Stop it. I’ll stay. - What? - I’ll stay. - I can’t hear you! - I’ll stay here! Rock-paper-scissors. Fine. Scissors mean first fuck. Yes! Come on, fatso! I swear. Try anything and you’ll be sorry. I promise you’ll never forget this. Who might that be? Daddy. Your daughter’s busy right now. Goodbye. I understand. Really. A horrific thing happened to your daughter. But life goes on. Find a hobby. The boys have to live with this. They failed their families. Their parents. That’s their punishment. If you’re interested, I know an excellent psychologist. Listen, they come from good families. They have excellent references. We can’t ruin their lives. That won’t help anyone. A word of advice. Try and forgive them. Otherwise it’ll drive you mad. Or should we send them to a borstal and turn them into criminals? Here. I wasn’t expecting to hear from you again. Last time you looked scared. I still wasn’t sure back then. And now? I am. I said it’d cost a fortune. I know that. I added up all the risks involved. It’ll cost four million. Some Russian might agree to do it for 100 grand. But that’s not what you want, I think. I’ll get the money. How? That’s my business. I want a deposit. One million on Friday. Let’s get one thing straight. I’m the boss. And you’ll do as I say. It has to look like an assault. It’s our only chance. I’m still planning it, but we can use the crime scene reconstruction. I’d like... When we get there, I want to be alone with them for a while. We’ll see. I need to pee. Make a final decision. No turning back after that. Cuff them. I’ll look around. Get out of the car! Leave your bags here. Out! Now! But this isn’t the place. I know that, you idiot. Stop calling me an idiot! You won’t fuck with me like you did with that girl. Go and get him. Go on in. Don’t worry. Go on. Let’s go. Don’t let anyone see you. Do you smoke? I do. Me too. You? Your loss. Is there something wrong, sir? No. Why? So why the handcuffs? They said there weren’t any charges against us. Don’t be scared. Everything’s legal. - Where is he? - Behind the car. You can’t be serious. Ten minutes should be enough. If you can beat a dog to death, you’re likely to be able to kill a man. Isn’t that what we want? Was it worth it at least? She was still a virgin, right? Yes. I’ve never had one. Maybe someday I’ll get a chance. What are you doing today? I have a date. I’m going to the cinema. You found a new girlfriend fast. Hanka wasn’t my girlfriend. She was just a friend. You were all friends with her, right? I’ll drop you right in front of the cinema afterwards, alright? You’ll impress your girlfriend. Are you kidding? You can’t miss a date just because of this nonsense. Listen, follow orders, and I’ll take you wherever you want. You’re really cool. Yes. But now I need to bind your legs. Fuck! - Got the rest of the money? - Yeah. Where are they? Inside. Take a look if you want. Nice shoes. Good you listen to advice. Go after him. He won’t do it, I think. - The guy’s just a scared doctor. - Then you can do it for him. Are you serious? Unless you have a better idea. Go after him like I said. You hear me? Yeah. Please put this over their heads. Fuck! Smoke? He doesn’t know what happened by the river. I didn’t tell him. You won’t do it, will you? I know why you hired us. You’re scared shitless, you wouldn’t even catch them! - Look at me. - What? - Look at me. Fucking look at me! Do I look normal to you? You have no idea what I’m capable of! We’d better hurry. They’ll send out a search party in an hour. What’s wrong? Something happened? - Have you thought about what he might do to them? - What? What if he tortures them? What they did was awful, but they’re only fourteen. - What’s your fucking point? - Nothing. - The guy’s crazy. - Shit! You just think too much. Come on. Let’s get them in the car. - Where is he? - I don’t know. - Get the fatso. - What? Holy cow! Fuck! Stop squirming, or I’ll kick your arse! Fuck! Damn it! The pig weighs a ton. Fuck this. Get the third one. Here you are. There’s still something we have to go over. Your associate. What about him? He makes me nervous. Relax. There are nine rounds. Three bullets each. Do you know where to shoot? Sure. Two for the head. One for the chest. Exactly. Damn it! Oh fuck! Here’s the tape. Where the fuck have you been? - Taking a piss. - I told you to stay with the car. Relax. I was watching them. If I go to prison because you fucked up... I’ll kill you! Got it? - I’ll do it. - What will you say? - When? - During questioning. That we were driving along. A guy was standing near a car. He was waving at us, it looked like his car had broken down. We pulled over. And then he pulled a gun on us. This isn’t necessary. I can do it. How much do you want? - Sorry? - For telling him I killed the dog. "No Entry" Where are you crawling to? Where are you going, you bastard? What did you think? What the hell did you think? That I’d just let it go? I went last. Hanka was still on the mattress. I told her not to be afraid. That I wouldn’t hurt her. Are you OK? We didn’t mean to hurt her. The guys said she’d like it. We’d just encourage her a little. Then what happened? I went over to her and untied her. Why? I was afraid. Of what? Of how she looked. She was pale. And shaking. I spoke to her, but she didn’t react. The guys said she’d be OK. That we’d take her home. Everything would go back to normal. What happened next? I told her to get dressed. And that she’d get all my money if she didn’t tell anyone. I gave her the bag with her clothes. I wanted to wait downstairs. But she started running and jumped out the window. I began yelling and ran after her. Tomas and Honza were already outside. I stood in the doorway. Hanka lay writhing on the ground. It sounded like she was suffocating. Blood was coming out of her mouth. Tomas was holding her head. He was screaming: "We need an ambulance. Otherwise she’ll die!" Honza didn’t react at all. And where were you? I was still in the doorway. Go on. Tomas started dialling a number. I asked him who he was calling. "An ambulance," he said. And then Honza attacked him. He grabbed the phone. They started fighting. And what did you do? I’m asking you what you did. Do you understand my question? Yes. Can you answer me? While Tomas and Honza were fighting. What were you doing? I’ll help you. I have Tomas’ statement. Honza attacked me. He grabbed my phone. We started fighting. Thirty seconds or so passed. I looked at David. He was kneeling over Hanka suffocating her with a T-shirt. I wanted to stop him, but Honza had me pinned down. You took off your T-shirt and suffocated her. Yes. Why? I was so scared my parents would find out! Why did you kill her? Why did you kill my little girl? Oh shit! Hey! Come on! Hey! Wake up! Can you hear me? Hey! That’s it! There. Now, now. Are you OK? - What happened? - I don’t know. What happened to you? I was driving along. And you were lying on the ground. Were you alone? Who beat you up like this? Come on. I’ll take you to the hospital. - Come on? - Hospital? - Yes, they’ll check you out. Relax. Got any ID? Come on. You’re covered in blood. I’ve got a rag in the car. You can use it to clean up. This used to be a military zone. It’s not easy to get here. Except for poachers. Do you remember how you got here? By car? Yes, I think so. Where were you going? But then I got in another car. But I don’t really know. Sorry. I don’t know. No problem. At least you’re OK. - Where are we going? - To hospital. - Hospital? - Yeah. Just to be safe. No phone service out here in the wilds. There’s no one else around to take you there. I bought that for my grandson. For his birthday. It was his wish. It’s a waste of money, I know, but what can you do? You know how it is. Do you have kids? Any children? Yes. I think I do. I think so. That’s good. Do you remember where you work? What’s your job? - Hospital. - Yes, we’re on our way. Don’t worry. I’ll take the shortest route. Through the quarry. You must’ve had quite a shock to make you lose your memory. I can understand that. It happened to a friend of mine. A tractor hit him. He was in such shock that he lost his memory. So us guys cooked up a story that he owed us money. But he didn’t even know his own address, so we... Pull over! You’re shaking. I have to go back. Sorry? We have to go back. I forgot something important. Please. Take me there. - We have to go back. Please. - I didn’t see anything. Right now! Can you hear me? Now! We have to go back. Fine. We’re going back. - There’s no bag here. - No, no, it has to be here. It was a brown leather bag. Hey! Where are you going? Oh shit! Damn! Bloody hell! Shit. I’m sure I had it. That bastard. Hello! Anyone here? Oh, my God! Wake up! Can you hear me? Wake up. C’mon. Hey, kid! Are you OK? Wake up. Help me! "Quarry" Calm down, boy. Don’t be scared. It’s over now. I won’t hurt you. C’mon. Get in the front seat. Relax. That’s it. Relax. There. Oh shit! I’ve got you! I know a shortcut out of the quarry. Then run through the woods all the way down. We’ll meet in the reeds. I’ll honk twice. Got it? Don’t worry. It’ll be fine. Go! Where are you? Where are you? Are you in there? I need the phone! Damn it! Where is he? Where is he? Where is he? I thought you were a victim. You’re a fucking psychopath! - You know nothing about me, so shut up. - I’ve seen enough already. Where is he? Gone. Mind your own business. I don’t want to hurt you. That’s what you told those boys? Made them beg for their lives so you could beat them to death? Where is he? Where is he? Where is he? If only you’d been there to help my daughter. You’d have saved her life. What happened to your daughter? Three classmates lured her out of town. They raped her. And killed her. She was fourteen. So were they, so no charges were brought. I’m sorry about your daughter. But this won’t bring her back. You can’t understand that unless you go through it yourself. - It’s over now. - No, it’s not. - Yes, it is. No, it’s not! It’s not! I have to finish this. I have to, I have to! What if I call your grandson now and toy with him? Grandpa, the game’s called "Vendetta." Will you buy it for me? Patrik. What a nice name. What a nice name. Hi, Patrik. I’m Grandpa’s friend. We caught a poacher in the woods today. Grandpa’s busy. So he asked me to deliver your birthday present. He won’t have time today. It’s a game you really wanted. It’s called "Vendetta", I think. I’ll be driving Grandpa’s car so you’ll recognize me. Just tell me when and where to meet. You bastard! Help! Help! It’s over now. No! No! No! You can’t! No! No!
