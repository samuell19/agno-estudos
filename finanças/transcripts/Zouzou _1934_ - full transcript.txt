Wasn't I brought by the same stork? Yes, it was the same stork. But that goofy bird let you fall down the chimney. Why didn't the stork make two trips? You're our dad, right? Of course. Then the father of Zou Zou is also my father. Well, your father is another story. You know, children, I didn't know anyone. So we have two parents? Well, two parents... What did my father say when he died? - I told you a hundred times. - Come on, what did he say? He said: "I was only her father, you be her dad." And what did you say? I said the same thing, but his eyes, poor man, because he could no longer speak. And what eyes! When so rotated, the whole circus died laughing. I always remember, with his red suit, his silk tights and stockings. He was so famous that he always closed the show. Even after following a number of horses. But mine also I was going to end. Yes, son, yours, too. With his parents in the group there was enough to fill the rooms. I remember one night in Amsterdam... No, it was in Turin. We will. Do not ever forget, Father Scrum, right?

Now we are surprised and count the days. One, two, three, four... five, six... Rogue. So quickly we age. Nine...

Zou Zou, do you know the star? When is the premiere? - Do you have free tickets? - Leave her alone. Talk about something else. Zou Zou is very mysterious. When will we get lingerie like this one? It is not difficult. Do as Barbara does. - What does a gigolo do? - This is not a gigolo. It is Saint-L?vy! Do not get upset. He is very rich. He directs the music hall. You know everything. In this business, one learns the dark side of things. Do you think of love? Love! Any young so small? They say it's a snake. The baskets are ready. Who delivers them? I cannot. Neither can I.

Well, too bad for you. - I do the orchestra. - And I see me! Twenty times a day dozens of very passionate lords Offer a queen's lifetime to deliver them to me. But there is only one that I like. he is Evil and doesn't have a penny Their stories - between us, are not very clear. I know well but I do not care.

No time, there is a lot of pressure. Every day I love him more than the previous. For me... For me there is only one man in Paris. it is he. For me there is only one Paris man... Hey, Saint-L?vy is in the room. Charming! For me there is only one man in Paris. it is he. For me there is only one Paris man... Miss. I beg you, I beg you. More intensity!

It's almost 4 pm. Go take the clothes to the theater You cannot take them all alone. I'll explain, friend. Barbara is a star going straight... To disaster! - What? - It's as I just said. Exactly! How much has it cost so far? 500,000 to 600,000 francs. - 500,000 to 600,000 francs? - At least. For that amount you can buy a field with old oaks, a trout river, and a mansion. And a field that does not sing. I love her. How can you not love a woman that leads to ruin? We will. That door leads to the stage. Hello, Zou Zou! - Hurry up! - Are you Jean? Yes. Clothing delivery. You'll see later. Right. Come with me. It's so wild, so wonderful! What gets me is a jaguar. A jaguar, Mr. Saint-L?vy? I never would have imagined. Saint-L?vy, no. It's a flea, a penguin. And who is the jaguar? - My lover! - Does your lover? And Mr. Saint-L?vy? I am your lover. How complicated! Mr. Saint-L?vy could cut off the faucet. And the jaguar would not have a penny. F*** my career. I'm not an artist, I am a woman. A woman vibrating like a cello. Is the jaguar a cellist? - What is your name? - Your first name? Chachagura. - What? - It is Brazilian. Brazilian? - She wants to marry me. - Who? With him! And then I?ll go across the world. In the moonlight, we will make love while the birds sing. Bird of Paradise, whimsical gazelle, my dragonfly. The entire zoo. Go away or I will bite! You are nervous! Again, you were drinking coffee. Viva Brazil! Pass! Your clothes, lady. - Is this the first time you have been behind the stage? - Yes. Zou Zou told me much about you. She already knows a little. So do I. In the laundry, she always talks about you. - Are you also a washerwoman? - Yes. - Good job. - Yes. I would have liked, but for a man... Naturally. That's it. It is very nice, isn?t it? Maybe we will finish early, Zou Zou. Do you want to dance? That would be good! Jean, we have to take Claire. Of course, if she wants. Do they bother you? How are they going to bother me? What a fool. I feel like dancing. See you later. I will continue working. What do you think? DANCING From the streets of Les Halles to the streets of Huchette everyone knows Fifine, the queen. At night when passing she attracts all eyes. The neighborhood boys shout without praying.

She always causes problems. - Thanks for nothing. - She's not my fault. Zou Zou's dream is dead. Take the key and go up. I will accompany Claire. It is not necessary. I live very close. Of course, I will accompany you. Good evening, Claire. Tomorrow. Zou Zou, it seems to me that you lead a chaotic life. If you had seen him fight, Jean! - Again? - Yes. A big guy tried to grab him. And Jean began: punch, punch. The big guy ended up under the table with a black eye as well. And his nose... It was beautiful, Dad. It's disgusting. - I'm so happy. - Go to sleep. - Good night, Dad. - Good evening, Zou Zou. - Goodbye! - Good night. - When can I see her again? - I do not know. - Tomorrow? - I do not know. - Don't you know? - No. I have to go.

If parties will be in a drawer with a knife stuck in the heart. If you have a heart. You would not go to Rio without me? Barbara, I told you that I must leave. But you also said you would marry me. I gave up everything for you. Even a fortune. Still it is something. Chachagura! What do you call a man who exploits women? You're a pimp. I think so. Hello? Since I left! Yes, everything will be delivered. Do not expect miracles! Yes, Yes I will have it in 15 minutes. Hurry up with the clothes for the music hall! They are getting nervous! - So heavy. - I look forward to Sunday. - Did you tell the suits? - Yes. - Here it is. - Thank you. Claire, are you coming? Today I cannot. There is too much work. - Why? - Take my brother. Pierre. Zou Zou will accompany you. - Well, if you want. - Good. Take a taxi. Give no tip and bring me a receipt. Claire! Did you deliver the diapers to the Children's Hospital? The manager of the Moulin Rouge complained again. His shirt was not well starched. - Have you gone mute? - No, Mom. - Claire, you're hiding something. - No, Mom. Claire! Speak! Don't you see I'm worried? A mother should be charged with all the problems of the world! This is Zou Zou. Why put Zou Zou in such a state? Yes. I'll tell you, Mom. Zou Zou and Jean are like brothers. - Which Jean? Did you know? - Let me finish, Mom. Zou Zou is in love with Jean. If you knew how much she loves him. So what? All the girls have the right to love. But I'm also in love. What? With Jean. And I know he loves me. Hey, Claire. What are you talking about? Daughter, daughter... That driver is Jean? - It's the electrician. - Electrician! If your poor father knew... Zou Zou loves him very much, and me too. And I really love Zou Zou. - Does Zou Zou know? - I dare not tell. And Jean cannot tell? He does not understand. He cannot believe it. Well armed electrician. -Josette! -Leave me alone! Men are all monsters! George and I dance on Sundays. My boyfriend is cheating on me. With his luxurious car! Women like that. And your Egyptian student returned to his country. Will he return? Egyptian students - never again! How do you know? I met one and I'm still waiting. What is it? It's a shame! Years ago and no screams. He is hungry. Look at that! It is the worst disaster since Titanic. You call that a musical? What a joke! Now I know there are miracles. One more trick for the last time and all goes well. The goalkeeper who suddenly becomes a great actor. The usher who becomes a star in a day. I do not believe in those things! If I have to produce this garbage... - No, let me... - You know nothing. Leave me alone! Do not worry. Get dressed. My heart fills like a balloon. She will. I've already booked a cabin on the ship. And your jaguar? She is going to Brazil and I cannot live without her. Josette, if you only knew. - When I get... - Who? - His jaguar. - What jaguar? Get out of here! What is it? I will smack you!

It is better to eat it cold. Look, Jean. Are you crazy? Don't I look good? - Yes, it's very nice. - I think so. Get there. I want to adjust the reflector. I don't know. Don't be afraid. Mira. Don't worry, the curtain is down. Turn left. Now here. Slowly and carefully. Stay there. Have you finished eating? - What good lighting. - I think so. Jean. Do you want to open? And that woman? Who is that woman? Where did she go? How did she get off the stage? Find her! Right. Anyone can take over the stage. Incredible! Go get it! Pass! Did you call me? What is it, Miss? The lamp broke. She loved him so much. Do not worry. I?ll fix it. He loved me, but he no longer loves me. Explain that. A short circuit. And after that? After I left. She goes to Rio How is Rio de Janeiro? I'm going to die! Not die. When are you leaving? Today Today? Couldn't you stop her? I cannot be without her? Well, kill him. What about suicide? I can understand. Do you get dizzy on a boat? - Go with him. - She does not want to. What does it matter? Did you reserve a cabin or the whole ship? - One cabin. - Then there is a place for you. If you love him, do not let him go. Love is like electricity. It needs contact to work. You saved my life! ... madly in love. The boss wants to talk to you. Come on! Come! Caviar morning and evening, a bank account... Man eating! - Where is Miss Barbara? - I was looking for her, exactly. Get out! Where is Miss Barbara? No rest. It's a girl. You! Leave me alone!

What you face. - Have you lost your money? - Is your lover cheating on you? Yes! Jean? I cheated. - With that woman. - What woman? This woman! They were kissing. Jean would be unable. It cannot be. It is true, Claire. - Are you coming to dinner? - No, I will miss the subway. Goodbye, Claire. Goodbye, Zou Zou. Goodbye. Claire. Are you going home? What are you doing tonight? Many fleas, puppy. God! What happened? He fell from the scaffold. We found him underneath. Dad... Let's get the doctor. Father Melee... Answer me. Does it hurt? Zou Zou. My little Zou Zou. Jean, you're very quiet. Ladies and gentlemen: Tonight, for the first time in this city... Okay, kids... Father Scrum! Jean! Jean! Jean! Father Scrum, listen to me! Answer me! Jean! Claire! - Do you remember that dance? - Shut up. - Will you dance? - I don't want to. Yes, there are days when one is not in the mood and does not know why. - Do you have any cigarettes? - No. I will buy some. - With filter. - Yes. - Julot, do not leave me like this. - Leave me alone. - I participated in the theft of the jewelry. - Yes. So what? - You owe me 5,000 francs. - I owe you nothing. - Give it to me or I'll kill you. - I will not. - Got it? - I don't owe you anything. - Add me, understand? - Get out. - They had outstanding accounts. - They fought in my bar the other night. But it was not him! He had gone out to buy cigarettes. Say, Jean! We will. Well, don't push. It was not him! Jean! - I said it was not me. - Yes, of course. It was not him! It was not him! I swear it was not him! Jean! Jean! - Jean! Father Scrum is dead! - What? Don't leave me, Jean! Do not worry, I will solve this. They arrested him right there. And he is innocent! Although he is innocent, he will still be tried. And you can try someone who has not yet been born. Why did he go out to buy cigarettes? I asked him to. I forbade smoking. Did you forbid it or not? A mother provides everything. Snuff is bad. Do you know how much damage it can cause? Why did that jerk raise his gun? I don't know what he was doing. Mom, we need help. It is easy to go to jail but it costs you dearly to get out. There are many innocent who are poor. A poor innocent is a culprit. And Zou Zou? Have you heard from her? No, no one knows where she is. - Did you go to the police? - Yes. The commissioner was not there. It never hurts. Poor Jean! I no longer know what to do to help. Two beers and a sandwich. - I talked to his lawyer - Who is it? A lawyer. - He would not listen. - I'm not surprised. Zou Zou, if we had money, things would be different. Money, money... I'll call that guy and say what I think. I don't do the evening shift. George is very jealous. Pass the mustard. I took singing lessons and I got a small role. How much will you earn? With matinees, 2,000 francs per month. Not bad for these times. Your name on a sign, a mansion with a fountain and a goalkeeper. In this profession, talent will get you everything. What, Gabby. I bet you have a savings account. - Until I have a checkbook. - With checks, right? Clear. It was a weekend. - Will you be there tomorrow? - I think so. I need to see Mr. Trompe. - Do you think I will get to see him? - Of course! How are you? It is unusual. When needed, it disappeared. And now it suddenly appears. What's wrong? See, sir. I need lots and lots of money. Christ! They are all the same! They take me for Croesus. What do you think? Thank you! We have an agreement. I am willing to comply. Want a raise? It is a success. Test yourself before the public. It is a unique opportunity. But I will not try as Miss Barbara. No! Once was enough. But I laughed a lot. Yes, I really laughed. Which characters, gentlemen. I swear it was not easy to get permission, and at what price, for the exclusive presentation in Paris. All the cities in South America wanted it. Her African tour was a triumph. London was a great success. wherever she went, mile after mile, she found her path strewn with camellias, her favorite flower. But she drew Paris, Paris, the City of Light. And so Zou Zou... Are you rehearsing a role? No, I'm practicing my speech for the journalists. I love to hear these kinds of stories. God! The curtain! My amulets! - Which one? - The missing one. - What? - Cuckold! Look. God, make it a success. Count on Him Do not get nervous. There is no time. Now it is Laforet. I might have stage fright. I should not say it. - Are not you afraid? - No. You're still angry. Are you still thinking about it? - Who is it? - Can we come in? Not impossible. We are completely naked. They are completely naked... They cannot keep him in jail forever. You spend a lot of money on it. What did you counsel? Do not call anyone? No. Nobody. - Do not talk to Poireau? - I have not seen him. Who will give me back my Haiti Haiti, my only paradise. When I remember your beautiful forests and vast horizons far from your shores a cage most beautiful is nothing more than a prison. My desire, my love song, Haiti to come back to you someday. Beautiful blue and distant country under your distant skies I lived happy days. But it all ended and today I am alone in my exile singing with my heart destroyed. My desire, my love song, Haiti to come back to you someday. Haiti. Josette... - Did I scare you? - Are you happy? Did it go well? Yes, very well. I clapped a lot. I'm not surprised. - Josette. - What? He is safe. Jean is safe. - He went crazy. - Watch this! BANK ROBBER CAUGHT He is the man who killed Julot. It is he. It's not possible. What are you doing? - I'm going. - How are you going? - Quick, my coat. - Are you crazy? And the show? You'll go another time, other day, when you have time. Your scene is about to begin. - My shoes, Josette! - I cannot give you anything. Think about it, Zou Zou. All Paris is there. There are ministers, ambassadors... - I do not care! - Do not go! You'll have to go over my dead body! What do we do? You will start your scene. On stage! - She's gone! - Who? Zou Zou, of course! - Tell the boss. - He will drop dead when he knows. - Where'd she go? - I do not know. She saw the picture of a man in the paper, said to be the murderer. I do not understand. What a mess! What a mess! What a mess! - Are you sure? - Completely, commissioner. Look at it closely. It would be very serious if you were wrong. No, I'm not mistaken. Are you quite sure? He jumped into the street in front of me. I saw his hand on the... - About what? - The railing. It was not me! - What's so unusual his hand? - She needed to see his finger. And it also has a scar there. I tell you it was not me! - Then, show us your hand. - It was not me. Let's see. I'll take him. Sit down, lady. Thank you. Now, tell me how it all happened. It was the day that Father Scrum died. It was raining. Jean and Claire had gone dancing. Hurry up, girls! Come on! - Continue. - What? Continue. Do an encore. Come on, we'll do an encore. Orchestra, orchestra. I have been 30 years in the theater and I've never saw anything like it. I've been here 30 days and I saw it. I'm spoiled. What do I do? Dear friend, You are the only one who can save me. But I dance badly. Where is Barbara? She sent me a postcard. Go get it! - Do you need it now? - Immediately! She's in Rio de Janeiro. - She's back! - Make her come here. - She's in her dressing room. - Go search for her. - She?s coming up. - Make her come down! Josette! Where were you? It's a shame! - Hurry, Josette! - But she is naked. Quick, let it happen! I was sure that she would return. Where are the times when I am driven to madness by a man? That's what I wonder. For me there is only one man in Paris. I cannot help I gave my heart. I must have lost my mind and he's so silly and not yet understood. For me there is only one man in Paris. I would crawl through a hole for him. Every day I love him more than the previous. For me there is only one man in Paris and he is it. For me there is only one man in Paris. 20 times per day Dozens of very passionate lords offer me a lifetime of being a queen if I surrender to them. But there is only one that I like He?s evil and does not have a penny Their stories are not very clear I know well but I do not care. He is so stupid and not yet understood. Every day I love him more than the previous. For me there is only one man in Paris and he is it. For me there is only one man in Paris. Chasing all the girls. All are at his mercy. The undressing of his gaze with his hands, too. I do not do anything for him to love me. I make others happy. but he still remains mine, because he is in my heart. He is so stupid and not yet understood. Every day I love him more than the previous. For me there is only one man in Paris and he is it. For me there is only one man in Paris. What a triumph! It is a miracle. We, the public want you! Curtain! It's crazy. I cannot stop crying. Even for Cyrano de Bergerac I did not cry like that. Wait, Zou Zou! - Jean? - You will leave tomorrow! 100th REPRESENTATION My desire, my love song, Haiti END
