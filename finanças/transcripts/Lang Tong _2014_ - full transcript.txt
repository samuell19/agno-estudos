SEE YOU THERE AT 5 P.M. SEE YOU Next. How are you? Are you Stephanie? -Yes. -I'm Zack. -Hi. -Hi. -Finally, we meet. -Finally, we meet. -Let's go. -Okay. This is a nice place. Yes. Thanks. -Let's eat. -Okay. This is delicious. It tastes like my mom's pork rib soup. Thanks for bringing me here. I'm glad you like it. Does your mom still cook this for you? No. My mom passed away years ago. She divorced my dad when I was very young. I stayed with her. I grew up eating her pork rib soup. I really miss that. I'm sorry that I brought up your unpleasant past. It's okay. I've gotten over that. How about your family? You haven't said a lot about them. My parents passed away when I was young, too. I grew up with my elder sister. She took care of me until I turned 21 and started working. One day, she disappeared suddenly. She didn't call me. We lost contact. I have no news of her whereabouts. I couldn't locate her to this day. Perhaps it was me who drove her away. She had to take care of me like a parent. I was very dependent on her. It must have been tough for her. But you turned out fine. I love children. I am lucky to work as a tuition teacher. At least, I enjoy what I am doing. But sometimes, it can get lonely. I know how you feel. I'm just like you. Working to make ends meet. You know what, I don't even like selling insurance, but I can't help it because it pays the bills. I have a good feeling that things are changing for the better. Because I've met you. Nice view. Do you plan to change your job? I have a friend who is a property agent. He asked me whether I'm keen to invest in overseas properties. Aren't those ventures a bit risky? There are risks in any business, but the returns are higher. Anyway, I'm still considering it. Let's change the subject. I don't want to bore you. Not at all. It's good to know more because I only know how to teach. That's a noble job. No, you're too kind. Yes, next! -Hey, you! -You're finally here. Are you busy with Stephanie? She is very clingy. She wants me to keep her company all the time. If I didn't tell her that I'm meeting you to talk business, I wouldn't even be here. You used me again. Of course. When are you going to dump her? Right now. -I'm Zack. -I'm Belle. -I'm Mike. -Becky. -One, two, three! -One, two, three! Drink up! Open the door. Coming. Stephanie. Open the door. Why are you so drunk? -I love you. -Come over. I love you. -All right. -I love you. Stop it. -I love you. -Zack. Zack, don't do this. Stephanie. Don't do this. Zack! Zack! Don't do this. Zack! No. No. Don't do this! What's wrong? Nothing. You can tell me. It's my own problem. I don't want to trouble you. Don't you trust me? Don't get me wrong. I trust you. I love you. I just... don't want to implicate you. Is it about money? Yes, it's about money. That's why I don't want you to... Let me help you. Come on. Tell me what you need. Remember the overseas property investment deal that I told you about before? Yes. I deposited 50,000 dollars, and I'm 20,000 dollars short. I thought that I could settle the amount with my sales commission, but... but my money didn't come in on time. If I can't settle the payment, I'll lose my deposit. I'm at a loss. -I'll lend you some money first. -No, I can't take your money. Just take it as a loan from me, okay? But, I can't. I can't thank you enough. As long as you will always love me. -Did you miss me? -Yes. -Who's that? -It's just a friend. -Did you miss me? -Yes. You did? Let's go. -Let's go over there. -What's for dinner tonight? Whatever you like. Zack? Why are you here? How could you? What? So? I like to fool around. You said that you loved me. I like you. I really like you. But I can't give up on other women because of you. If you don't mind, we can have a threesome. What has gotten into you? What? No. I know that you love me. Don't touch me. -Tell me-- -Stop it! Is it because of the money? -I don't need you to return-- -I don't intend to! -Please don't leave me. -Get lost! Come back to me, please. Get lost! You know what your problem is? You are too clingy. I can't stand it! I can change. -I'll change. Give me a chance. -Get lost! I'm warning you. Stop pestering me. Let's go somewhere else. Hey. How's your new prey? Settled. I've stayed at Li Ling's place for more than a month now. Hats off to you. Woman and money. You've got what you want. Hey, I've actually put in a lot of effort on her. I've even slept with her sister. You are despicable! You've slept with both of the sisters! You better take care of yourself. Otherwise, you will be exhausted from having too much sex! I have some drugs. Do you want some? I don't need your drugs to boost my libido. I can take care of myself. I'll prove it to you. Hi, girl. I'm Zack. Are you alone? HEADLESS CORPSE CASE POLICE STILL HAVE NO LEADS SISTERS KILL LIVE-IN BOYFRIEND Dear, the soup is almost done. Okay. Here you go. Wow, this is my favorite! Your cooking lesson is really paying off. Li Er, the soup is ready. Leave me alone. I want to sleep. Don't bother with her. This soup is delicious. -Dessert will be ready soon. -Okay. Dessert is here. -Wow! Red bean soup. -Yes. What's wrong? This dessert is really sweet! A sweet dessert for my sweetie. Could you buy some cigarettes for me? Okay. Do you need anything else? Please stop gambling. -Where's the money? -I don't have any more money! -Where did you put the money? -No! What is this? You should have taken it out earlier. -That's for our expenses! -You asked for it! I'll settle the expenses once I win it back! Who do you think I am? When have you ever won anything? I haven't even started gambling, and you're already cursing me to lose! I know. I'm on my way out. See you at the entrance later. Hey, Li Er, don't come back so late. Li Er is always out partying. I'm worried about her. Don't worry. She is still young. She will understand when she's older. If my dad was still around, she may have turned out differently. I'm here for you. Do you remember the overseas property we talked about the last time? I've deposited 50,000 dollars, but I'm still 50,000 dollars short. I thought I could settle the outstanding amount with my sales commission, but the money didn't come in on time. If I can't raise the outstanding sum, my deposit will be forfeited. Can I borrow from you first? I'll issue you a check tomorrow. Thanks. What is this? Is this a will? My assets and this house will be shared between you and Li Er when I'm gone. I want you. Mom? Mom? Mom? Mom? I've... I've let you down. Mom! Do you love me? Of course. Really? Would you do anything for me? What about my sister? I'll talk to her when the time is right. Then... help me get rid of her. What? Kill her. But, she's your sister. I don't care. Calm down. You can move out. You don't have to kill her. I'm serious. Why do you hate her so much? Because she's responsible for my mom's death. Your mom's death? After Dad left us, Li Ling blamed Mom for the separation. She disregarded Mom's feelings when it was really Dad's fault. He had an affair with another woman and left us. Mom killed herself because she couldn't take Li Ling's insults anymore. I can't believe that she would do that. I will never forgive her. Can you promise me? Look at you. You're having trouble with women, aren't you? I'm your buddy. Spit it out. Li Er wants me to kill her sister. What? Why? She blames Li Ling for their mom's death. Li Er will only agree to be with me if I promise to kill Li Ling. I'm lost. Actually, Li Ling treats me well. She's even left me a will to inherit her property and assets. Now, Li Er wants me to... I can't bring myself to do it. But, I also don't want to lose Li Er. I don't know what to do. Look, I warned you before, right? Now, you're in big trouble. Let me remind you, you're only after the money, not murder. I called you here to help me solve my problem, but here you are, judging me. Be decisive. Get rid of one of them. Either the elder sister or the younger sister, you've got nothing to lose, right? Am I right? Since you love Li Er more, then fulfill her wish... and kill her sister. You are right. If I kill Li Ling, I'll get her property and assets, and I can also be with Li Er. But, how am I going to do it? Poison. Come back and look for me tomorrow. Where's everyone? Li Ling! What happened? I know about you and Li Er's relationship. What are you talking about? I know it's just sex between the two of you. -You don't love her, do you? -I... I don't blame you. And I don't hate you. I know my sister is willful. I'm sorry. I couldn't resist the temptation. You know that our relationship is already on the rocks. I don't want to make things any worse than they are now. I'll talk to her. Did you see Li Er this morning? No. About last night, -you will talk to Li Er-- -I will. I know what to do. I'll talk to her. I'm running late. See you tonight. You had a good time last night, didn't you? She knows about us. How did she find out? Does she know about our plot? She knows about our relationship. Now, what do we do? You play along and pretend to be cordial with her. So that she won't suspect us. Will that work? Yes. She still loves you. When do we act? The day after tomorrow. Her birthday falls on the day after tomorrow. It would be the perfect time. Hey, did you bring it? When do we act? Tomorrow. It's Li Ling's birthday. Then, let's drink to that. Her birthday and doomsday! Bastard. By the way, I haven't had a chance to see what Li Er looks like. Can I have a look? I'll have to see for myself why you're so smitten by her. Wow. When you grow tired of her, just pass her over to me, so I can... Of course. You will get your fair share when it's all over. Do you have it? Here. Give it to me. Let me do it. Li Er, the day has come. You stink. Go take a shower. Let's do it together. You go ahead. I'll take over. The soup is almost ready. Okay. Happy birthday! I thought you had forgotten. Of course not. Come on. Come on. Have a seat. Li Er, your sister is back! Happy birthday. This is for you. Li Er. Li Ling, I'm sorry. Will you forgive me? Don't be foolish. Of course, I will forgive you. You're my sister. I'm glad that you're willing to talk to me. I've waited for this day for a long time. This is the best present I've gotten. Hey, I didn't know you can cook. Of course. There are a lot of things you don't know about me. Okay. Tonight's dinner is our favorite. Hey! Sit down. Let us pamper you tonight. Okay. Which bowl is for her? This one. Come on. Try my pork rib soup. It's my mom's recipe. Let me try. Wait! How can we celebrate without wine? You are right. Yes. I'll go get it. -Okay. -Okay. Pork rib soup reminds me of my mom. Why are you sweating so much? I was cooking. Didn't you say you and your mom were not on good terms? Yes. Since my dad left us. Before that, when we were still together as a family, Li Er and I used to look forward to our mom's pork rib soup every week. This bowl of soup brings back those good memories. It looks like we both share a similar past. The wine is here. Great. Let's drink to our future! Good wine. Li Ling, the soup is getting cold. Drink up. Zack spent a long time making this soup especially for you. Yes, drink up. Okay. It is delicious. There's something I need to confess. Actually, Li Ling didn't cause my mom's death. It was because of my adulterous, good-for-nothing dad, my mom committed suicide. And... Li Er and I are actually... Actually... There's someone that you should remember. She is actually my sister! I really don't understand men. Do you always use your penis to think? It is puzzling. Use your penis to think. You must be Mike. Yes. Is Zack around? He will be back later. He wants me to take care of you. Come in. Okay. Subtitle translation by Cheo Lek Tan
