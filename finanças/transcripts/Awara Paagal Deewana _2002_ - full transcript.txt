Please don't shoot. I'll do what you ask me to. I made a mistake. I won't do it again! Look, I have three wives, all of them will be widowed. I have 13 children and 26 dogs, all of them will be orphaned. As soon as I put the gun to his head, his face turned completely black! Scoundrel, liar! But sir, what was the advocate's mistake? His mistake was that he came into my bedroom to tell me that the police is looking for me, that too, without knocking. You killed him over such a small thing. You, idiot! I was with his wife. I was flabbergasted. Then? - You know how kind I am! I took pity on him before throwing him into the river. I thought of killing him, instead of torturing him. I caught him by the collar and took him to the terrace. I asked him what he wished. 'The choice is yours!' 'Will you jump or should I push?' That's it! He began to wail, 'I'm dead! Save me! Someone help me!' 'Is someone around?' 'I'm dead!' 'I'll die!' Father! Oh my God! Father has suffered a heart attack! Call an ambulance quickly! Call up his son quickly! Have you got the gun? - Yes. It's a .45 magnum model ATK with infrared night vision. Shoots 3 rounds per second. Even the world's best police force doesn't have this gun. It's a boon to global terrorism. Good weapon. - Thanks. This is wrong. What did you say? Guru Gulab Khatri and your father have already made a deal with someone else for this weapon. You can't betray boss by selling it to someone else. Who will stop me? I will... Take this pistol and leave the country. Sir, you have to eat this capsule! Capsule! - Yes. You'll feed me a capsule! I'll shoot you, doctor! I won't spare you if I die. Advocate! - Sir, keep the gun aside or else, I'll also have to lie down with you. Phone! - I've called your son. He must be on his way. You idiot! I asked you to call my son-in-law, not my son! My son is a fool! - Yes, I agree. My daughter's husband is a gem. Where is my son-in-law? Where is Guru? 'He is dangerous.' 'Sir, he is Guru Gulab Khatri. - Get him.' 'He is dangerous.' 'He is dangerous.' 'He is dangerous.' Hello? - Sir, father has been taken to the hospital. Come quickly! Father? What happened father? - It was destined! Look, I don't have much time. I've to tell you something that I'd kept secret till now. What is it father? Last year, I made a deal in America, whereby I got diamonds worth Rs 100 billion. And I... And I... What did you do, father? I've planted mango trees in the village. Forget the mangoes. What about the diamonds? Don't forget, they will rot. The diamonds will rot? You idiot! Not diamonds, the mangoes will rot, if you don't pluck them on time. Where have you hidden those diamonds worth 100 billion? Diamond! - Diamond! She was an amazing cow in the village! She used to give 10 litres of milk every day. She had a beautiful gait. All the bulls in the village were crazy about her. Make a memorial for her. I'll do that! Don't irritate me! - Spices! Your mother used to make pickle. I used to lick my fingers when she used to feed me. Dad, where have you hidden those diamonds worth 100 billion? Diamonds! - Father. The diamonds... In the American bank... Rs 75... - Diamonds worth Rs 75? Give Rs 75 to Laxmi laundry, and get my suit and tie. - Forget your tie. If you die, I'll have to wear a tie all my life. Where are the diamonds? - Die... Die... - Diamonds! Where are they? Dye my hair before I die. I want to die young. Where are the diamonds? Vikrant! - Stop it! Where are the diamonds? Father! Ballu Bol Bachchan alias Baba Baldevprasad Bandipurwala, has made a will before his death which I shall now read out to all of you. Okay. The will goes like this. He has divided his entire wealth among his son Vikrant, foster daughter Preeti and son-in-law Guru Gulab Khatri in three equal shares. According to the will, he has deposited diamonds worth Rs 100 billion at the New York Bank in New York city. The three of you can withdraw those diamonds from the bank, only if you go there yourselves and sign together. If any one of you dies, two of you have to sign and present the death certificate of the third. If two amongst you die, then one sign and two death certificate. If all three of you die, then the diamonds will be owned by Champak Lal. Who is Champak Lal? Give me his address. I'll kill him right away. How will you kill him? I'm Champak Lal. Advocate Champak Lal Sena Ramani. You're Champak Lal! You scoundrel! This is certainly your trick. - What're you doing? Let me go! Listen to the last clause in the will. What is the last clause? According to the will, if I die before the three of you, then all the diamonds will go to the animal husbandry trust. No one will get anything. No one will get anything if I die. Please think about it. Let me know whenever you wish to go to America to get the diamonds. I will be there. I'll send you to the land of no return! Hello! - Hello! Guru! I'm Preeti. - Yes, what can I do for you? Guru. Our marriage is a compromise. We accepted it to make father happy. We haven't met each other since we got married. We're strangers, not husband and wife. Now, father is no more. So I wish to end this farcical relationship. We should separate. I know why you want to divorce me. The will says that one-third of the diamonds belong to your husband. Which is me. After divorce, I'll no longer be your husband. You and Vikrant can then take my share of diamonds. I'm not at all interested in the diamonds! Shut up! - Listen to me, Guru. You've left me in a dilemma, father. On the one hand my stepbrother wishes to seize all the property. On the other hand, there is Guru. He doesn't even know that Vikrant wants to kill him. He must be hiding somewhere here, look inside! He will be hiding inside. Be careful. We have posted men here. He cannot escape. Okay, sir. Listen... Are you carrying a phone or coins? I asked you something. Send back-up commandos. He is here. Freeze. Surrender. 'Guru Gulab Khatri shot dead home minister Mani Shankar Sharma,' 'when he was inaugurating the international trade seminar.' 'Mumbai police has declared red alert in the city.' 'All the roads that lead outside the city have been sealed.' 'At railway stations, bus stations, airports, as well as all the check posts,' 'special police patrols have been put up at all corners of the city.' 'Police has claimed that Guru Gulab Khatri' 'will be nabbed, dead or alive in a few hours.' 'The murder of the home minister has created a stir.' Hello. - Don't say hello. Get ready to be shocked! Aren't you shocked to hear my voice? You wanted to trap me? You tried to kill Guru for a handful of diamonds. Now arrange for your own funeral. Because Guru knows where you are. But you don't know where I am. Guru. He escaped! Sir, I told you. Crime never pays. Shut up! He won't live. I'll find him. Someday, somewhere. Somebody must know where he is! "I've become crazy and carefree. I've become a lover." "Your eyes have robbed me of myself!" "My sweetheart... My sweetheart." "My sweetheart... My sweetheart." "I've given you my heart." "I've given you my heart." "I've become crazy and carefree. I've become a lover." "Your eyes have robbed me of myself!" "My sweetheart... My sweetheart." "My sweetheart... My sweetheart." "I've given you my heart." "I've given you my heart." "You're like the raging storm." "My thirsty heart longs for you." "Destiny brought us together," "and I realised I've become a lover." "Your eyes have robbed me of myself." "My heart only wishes for one thing." "To live in your arms" "forever and ever!" "You mean the world to me," "I've fallen in love with you." "Your eyes have robbed me of myself." "My sweetheart... My sweetheart." "My sweetheart... My sweetheart." "I've given you my heart." "I've given you my heart." Anu. My dentist, darling. Anu! It's 12 o'clock. - What! Does my beautiful face, remind you of a clock? No darling. You get up at noon every day, so I thought it's noon. Come on, honey. You know how badly mother scolded me today? Why? Didn't we sleep in different rooms yesterday? You didn't tell me you weren't keeping well. No. Then why didn't you hang the clothes to dry last night? It was 2 am by the time I washed the clothes, I don't know when I fell asleep. I like that! You made breakfast in the morning, broke people's teeth in the clinic, cleaned the house, did the dishes, washed clothes, cooked food, but you didn't fall asleep then! You had to hang five buckets of clothes to dry, and you fell asleep! Why didn't you keep the money you earned at the clinic under my pillow? Oh no, darling! I'm so sorry, I completely forgot. I swear, I am so sorry. I fell asleep. I don't know how and why I fell asleep. I was so tired! I was going to give you the money. Darling! Today, I need 20 dollars very urgently. 20 dollars. Darling, I'm asking for 20 dollars, not 20000. I need a tie... - Shut your mouth! (ECHO) It brings bad luck to ladies when men ask for money. Mother, my luck will change when I buy a new tie. - What? A new tie! 12 months back, you bought a new tie. What did you do with it? Ate it! Tell me. - That's torn and tattered! How dare you? Your father-in-law wore that tie for 25 years. He never complained! You think it has become old in just 12 months. I tell you! Tomorrow, you'll find me and my mother old too. Will you change us too? - Of course! What? - Not! Of course not! Viswajit! Viswajit! Here she is! Viswajit! Which sari will you wear? I don't know when he'll stop forgetting names. What are you doing with so many saris? Yesterday you bought 15 saris. I want to know which one needs to be ironed, Viswajit. Paramjeet! - Who is Paramjeet? My name is Paramjeet. I'm your wife! Sona, tell your mother, she keeps scolding me all the time. Father, my name is Mona, not Sona. Parimal, these saris made me forget her name too. Father my name isn't Parimal, I'm Anmol. Hey, Chunilal! What's wrong with you? Manilal! - Who is Manilal? Your name is Manilal. Manilal Patel. Since when did I become Manilal? - Since childhood! It's been my name since childhood. - Yes. And you're telling me now! Now, I'll remember that my name is Methilal. Oh Jesus! Jesus! Right now you said my name is Methilal. Where did Jesus.. - Get out! Get out. Go and make breakfast. Otherwise, I'll bite you! Don't bite me today. Yesterday's wounds haven't healed as yet. Come, brother-in-law. - I'm your son-in-law. For outsiders. In the house we both are servants. Come on! 'The students of France performed...' Where am I rotting? I married for a green card... and now I cut green vegetables! - 'For scholarship...' 'Some news from India.' 'Dangerous underworld mafia don Guru Gulab Khatri,' 'who is the main suspect in the murder' 'of late home minister Mani Shankar Sharma is still missing.' 'Famous Guru Gulab Khatri who invites people' 'lovingly for a coffee and then kills them' 'has also betrayed his opponent mafia don Vikrant.' 'So Vikrant has declared an award of Rs 20 million' 'to anyone who gives information' 'or address of Guru Gulab Khatri.' 'However, this news hasn't been confirmed.' 'Now some sports news.' Father, did you see? - Yes. Rs 20 million as reward. If you don't take the breakfast to the table soon, those two vamps will declare a 2 dollar reward on us. Come on, get the tea to the table. Yes. Father. - Yes! Make American chop suey for me. - I won't make it. Why won't you make it? I want 50 dollars. - What? We don't charge you for eating, and you need 50 dollars for cooking. I need the money to buy vegetables! Have I ever asked to be paid for cooking? Last week I gave you 50 dollars. You haven't given me an account. - I'll give it. It isn't easy. I need to think. If I make a mistake, you're after my life! If you give me 50 dollars today, I'll give you the total account. Okay? What is this? Give me the accounts by evening. I'll give it. I don't want to be thrown out. Come on, Tolmol. I'm not Tolmol, I'm Anmol. Come on, son-in-law. Why do you look sad? Don't you have to go to the clinic? Come on. What happened? Why are you so sad? I was thinking that I came to America in search of happiness. But all I got was sadness. I'm fed up of this humiliating life, father. I understand everything. I work all day at the clinic. I give mother all that I earn. Even then, I'm treated worse than a servant. I'll return to India, at the first opportunity. I've been looking for an opportunity for the last 25 years. But Satyajit has taken away my passport. Who is Satyajit? - Your mother-in-law, my wife. This is my fault. If I wouldn't have married, I wouldn't have had a daughter, neither would you be unhappy. 20 dollars for you. 20 dollars? - Didn't you ask for it? Keep it. But you... I'll muddle the accounts. It takes me 20 minutes to buy vegetables and 3 hours to write the accounts. Don't forget to buy your pants. Buy good pants. Come on. Drop me at the grocer's. Hello. Dr Anmol's dental clinic. May I help you? Sorry. No appointment before 2 weeks, honey. I told you I'm joking. When will I get to meet you, sweetheart? I love you my favourite don. I love you. Tina! Stop it. What are you doing? Oops! How many times have I told you to read a book on dental surgery? But you keep collecting these photographs of goons. What kind of a strange hobby is this? It isn't a hobby sir. It's a passion, obsession, emotion! In other words it is love, sir! My mother! I've taken great pains to establish this clinic. Please send these patients inside one by one. I have to leave early today. Today is a very bad day. Hey, doctor! What's your problem? You're always worried. My wife troubles me a lot. So what doctor? Throw her out of your life. What? I mean, leave your wife. - Leave? I mean divorce her! She won't divorce me. Why? She doesn't love you. She doesn't let you touch her. Why did she marry you? One doesn't get house-help in America. They're very expensive. - Oh really? Mona has warned me, even if I think about divorce, she'll commit half a suicide. What? Half suicide? What do you mean by that? People need 30 tablets to die. She'll consume 15 and leave a note for the police, that her husband is responsible for her suicide. She won't die, but she'll kill me. Oh so sad! That means you're in trouble! You neither belong to India nor America. Really! I don't know how long my innocent father-in-law and I, will have to live with our wives. Don't worry, doctor. Every dog has its day. Am I a dog? Don't you understand? Don't throw the garbage here. Can't you hear? I'm asking you not to throw garbage here. Don't you understand? I'm shouting myself hoarse! Are you crazy? Are you deaf? Don't throw garbage here! You're new here, so I'm nice to you. You rose tattoo, what is your name? Listen gentleman. Listen gentleman! What kind of a name is this? Don't you understand? Don't throw garbage here. I'm sorry. - Do you think this is India? You can do anything, say sorry and leave. - What happened? I'm tired telling this idiot for an hour, not to throw garbage here. Ask him to pick up the garbage or else.. Or else, what? You smart aleck! Once I get furious, I won't spare you! I'll break your bones! Is that so? - Is that so? First, you throw garbage and then say... - Father! Father! I tell you, once I get mad... - Father, I've seen him on TV. If I get mad.. - I've seen him on TV! Whether on TV or in the bathroom. If I get mad... - Listen to me! He is a great underworld don of India. There is a reward of Rs 20 million on him. I don't care who he is, so what if he's a don? Father, he is Guru Gulab Khatri, who kills people by inviting them for coffee. He is the same man. Is he a don? - Yes. A great don. Is he a don? - Yes. So what were you saying? What will you do if you get mad? No! I was saying that if I lose my temper, I calm down easily! You've come here for the first time. You're my neighbour. You should've told me. Throw the garbage here. We also throw our garbage here. Where else will you throw the garbage? Throw the garbage here. I'm Anmol Acharya. A dentist. If you've a toothache, tell me. Okay? Tell me. - And my name is... What is my name? I forget my name at the right moment! Just now somebody asked me, 'Manilal, where are you going?' Manilal. - Yes. He is smart! Can you see that house? I'm a housewife. I mean, house husband. Come for tea anytime. Okay? You come with me for coffee. - Where? Come on. - No! Come on! - No. I've work. Work later. - I need to wash the dishes and clothes! You come. - No... I also have to work. - Come on quickly. What's wrong? One of you come for coffee with me. Mona! Where are you? - Close all the doors and pull the curtains. Hang any cloth! - Why are you screaming? Hang Ranjeet's sari like a curtain. My name isn't Ranjeet, it's Paramjeet. Whatever your name is! Just pull the curtains. Mona! A don from India has come to live in our neighbourhood. They have put a Rs 20 million price on his head. Where are you? - Rs 20 million price! Let me see what he looks like. Where are you going? I won't let you go. Mother, look Anmol isn't letting me see him. What? Have you broken her heart again? I didn't do anything. - You go! Tell me if he is handsome! You old woman! He isn't a hero. He's a goon. He'll kill you. You don't understand Karamjeet. My name isn't Karamjeet, it's Paramjeet. Whatever it is! He won't ask for your name before shooting you. The bullet will pierce your neck. Close the door! He's dangerous! He can shoot at any time. Really? - Yes. What do we do now? My advice would be, to pack our clothes and leave for Mumbai. Good idea! I'll pack. You get the passports. I'll buy the tickets. I'll get the money. We'll buy the tickets right away. Yes, come on. - Let's go. Wait! There's no need to buy any tickets. I think so too! We'll get into the plane without tickets. When the ticket checker comes, we'll give him 5 dollars. We used to do the same in Rajkot. No one is leaving. I've seen through your trick. You want to run away to India, by scaring us with a don! No, he is a dangerous and deadly don. If he is a deadly don, I'm a deadly vamp too. I've no doubts about it. - Shut up! Just go into the kitchen, and do your work! We let go of such a good opportunity. Come, let's cook. Anmol! It's a long climb down! Come, let's go to the police station quickly. Police station. Why? I've written this letter to the police. Just check if the language is correct. - What is this? I've written in this letter, that a big goon from India, lives in our neighbourhood. Have you seen the signature? I've signed it as Ajit. Who is Ajit? - Your mother-in-law. My wife. But father.. - When the goon comes to know that these two have written this letter. He will kill both of them. Then the police will kill the goon. One letter will solve both problems, let's go! It isn't working. - Do something we're getting late. We need to push it. Oh God! - The battery has discharged. Can I drop you somewhere? 'He is dangerous.' We'll go ourselves. - Yes. Come, I'll give you a lift. What do we need a lift for? We live on the ground floor. We don't have to go up in a lift. We'll go. - Yes, we'll go. I mean in my car. No. We'll go. It's just 15 miles from here. He'll walk half way, and I'll walk the other half. - Yes. Yes. Where are you going, by the way? We don't want to go to the police station. Police station? No! Not the police station, post office! Yes, we have to go to the post office. I have to post a letter. Keep this carefully. - No, you keep it. You're elder to me. Keep it carefully, stupid! - No, father. Give me, I'll post it. - No! No! Why will you take the trouble? I'll post it. What's wrong? You're excited like a teenager. Is something special written in it? Nothing special! I've written nothing about you. Nothing special! Don't write about me. Because I don't like if anyone reads, writes or understands anything about me. Understand? That's right! We don't even know you. We don't even know that you're from India. - Father! He doesn't even know that there's a price on your head. Rs 20 million! Do you have any idea? He doesn't know. Come on! I don't like it, if anyone talks about me or discusses me. I get furious! When I was born, I bit the doctor. Why did you bite? - Why? He was screaming, 'Congratulations! You have a baby boy.' I bit him, and he died, scoundrel! Please don't. I don't bite now. It's good to know that you've controlled your anger now. When a man grows up, he changes his ways. Now, my speaking parrot bites. A speaking parrot. - You own a parrot. We have never seen it. Wow! Let me show you. Do you keep it in your pocket? Doesn't it bite you? Parrots bite you if you keep them in your pocket. This isn't a parrot. Someone has duped you. This is a knife. - Knife. You chop vegetables with it. It's not a parrot. This is a speaking parrot. If its tongue touches any man, then he begins to rattle off like a parrot. Not me. No... I find both of you very innocent and childlike. So I give you 3 lifelines. Time please! I have a doubt. Three means, 3 for him and 3 for me. That becomes a total of 6. You didn't understand. Total 3. One and a half for you and one and a half for me. Isn't it? Don't laugh. He'll kill us. I love your smile. I love your smile. - Mine is also good. Come along. Let's have coffee. - No, I'm fasting. I'm fasting too. Come, let's have coffee. There is fire outside and a volcano inside. Where do we go now? Come on! Are you here already? - Darling, I was waiting for you. I think it's the wrong house. No, Anmol. You're in the right house. Mona, get chilled water for dad. But I wash the dishes with hot water, not cold water. Not to wash the dishes, but to drink. Do you want to have chilled buttermilk? Has Florence Nightingale's spirit possessed you? What are you saying? - Yes... Come on, have dinner. You must be hungry. I'm starving. But I need to cook first. - Yes. I'll cook when you let go off my hands. Dinner is ready! - Dinner is ready! What is this? Darling, when did you get married the 2nd time? You didn't even invite us. - What are you looking at now? Come and have dinner. Look, your favourite pudding. - Pudding! Don't eat that pudding, they'll feed us and torture us later. Sweetheart, don't you dream every night, about going to India? Just a minute. Who is this sweetheart? Why does he dream like me? - Oh God! I'm talking about you. Here are your passports. Ours? - Yes. These are your air tickets. Passport! Hail the Goddess! You vamp! Witch! What are you saying? I used to unnecessarily, think like this about you. No one would've given a divorce so willingly. Darling, when I go to India after freeing myself from your clutches, I'll dream only about you. Come on, Bimbo. - Yes. Wait! I'm not divorcing you. I'm sending you to India for 10-12 days. Oh! She is bailing us. Yes. You have to return with Rs 20 million from India. 20 million? Darling, you're asking for dowry at this age. Shame on you! Oh, shut up! Look at this. This... This is our address. We know it, we should never come back here. Look back. - Where? Oh God! Look here. - Here, tell me properly. This is Guru Gulab Khatri. Yes. You have to go to India and inform Vikrant that he lives in our neighbourhood. No! We won't do this! - No! We won't do this! You'll have to do it! No, we won't go to India. - No, we won't go to India. Okay, then I'll send Vikrant this photograph and tell him, both of you have hidden Guru Gulab. Mother, we don't want to be killed by Vikrant! Then you'll have to go to India. No, we won't go to India. - No, we won't. Then we'll torture you to death! Clean the bungalow in half an hour. - Do the dishes in 15 minutes. Wash and iron the clothes in 10 minutes. Cook dinner in 5 minutes. In 2 minutes... Just a minute! We'll go to India! Your room has been booked at Hotel La Meridian, room 502. Get ready to leave tomorrow morning. Wow! You're going to India! That means your mother-in-law and wife have released you! No. I'm going to India for some important work. At least, you'll have a vacation. I hope I don't get a vacation for life. Don't worry, doctor. God is sending you to India, something good will come of it. Okay, bye. Listen, after I leave, look after the clinic. Okay? - 'Important news.' 'India's famous don Guru Gulab Khatri,' 'tricked Mumbai police.' Hello, Tina? Guru! - In spite of heavy scrutiny... Tina? Hello? 'This photograph has been taken from the internet.' Guru... - 'A lovely smile...' My handsome don! 'Difficult to imagine this innocent face belongs to a mafia don.' "A beauty and her beloved stood in the warm sunshine." "She looked at him with her blue eyes," "and a strange emotion arose in their hearts." "A beauty and her beloved stood in the warm sunshine." "She looked at him with her blue eyes," "and a strange emotion arose in their hearts." "I've sworn to love you, my darling." "My love for you is boundless." "Please wrap me in your arms!" "My restless heart urges you" "to close the distance between us!" "From the moment I saw you, I've fallen in love with you." "I can't live in peace. I'm in love with you!" "A beauty and her beloved stood in the warm sunshine." "She looked at him with her blue eyes," "and a strange emotion arose in their hearts." "Why do I long to be in your arms all the time?" "A strange new sensation has taken over me!" "Your love makes me crazy!" "Both are head over heels in love with each other." "Look at those crazy lovers. They are lost in their own world!" "I've sworn to love you, my darling." "My love for you is boundless." "Please wrap me in your arms!" "My restless heart urges you" "to close the distance between us!" "From the moment I saw you, I've fallen in love with you." "I can't live in peace. I'm in love with you." "Oh darling, please don't stop me." "Let me steal you away from this world." "Let me hide you beneath my tresses." "Love has spread the fire of restlessness between them." "The world could not stop them from coming close to each other!" We'll have a bath and then look for that goon. We don't have to meet Vikrant. Then who will reward us? Vikrant will give us the reward, father. But he'll kill Guru Gulab Khatri. Is this right? No! No! Then what do we tell our wives? I've thought about it. We'll return and say, we couldn't meet Vikrant. This is the best idea! We'll stay here for seven days. Eat, drink and enjoy. We don't have to wash clothes, neither do the dishes. We'll call room service for all our meals. It's a great idea! You look innocent, but you're a clever scoundrel! Come on. We'll include the expenses in the accounts. Understand? Tube light! Where is the light? Is there no light in this hotel? What is this? - I think it's a mannequin. Yes. But it isn't naked! I've seen a smuggler's mannequin for the first time. Wow! He's wearing gold. It looks real. What has happened to him? - I don't know. Forward! He stammers! What did you say? Sorry. It seems we're in the wrong room. We'll leave. - Hey! You are in the right room. Oh! So you're in the wrong room. Leave! I'm also in the right room! It seems, we're in the wrong hotel. - Right. You're in the right place. Don't act smart. Stand properly. That's amazing! The hotel and the room are right. Are you going to stay with us? But we've paid for 2 people only. Do one thing. You give us the rent. Indirect income, understand? We can adjust later. The thing is that we've booked first, so both of us will sleep on the bed. You take a bed sheet and sleep on the floor. Do you understand? Now let's talk about money. Give me some advance. Advance booking! Stop talking nonsense, or else I'll punch you. Do you know who I am? How will I know, if you don't say who you are? The great dons of India call me. Chota Chatri. Chota Chatri! So, he is an umbrella seller. - Yes. We don't want any umbrella. Neither big nor small. It isn't raining now. What do I do with an umbrella? If I buy one now, I'll have to account for it to my wife. Does he understand? - Oh God! Go to some other place. You dimwit! I haven't come here to leave, but to take you. Listen, tarpaulin. - Hey! I'm Chota Chatri! Who is Chota Chatri? - My name is Chota Chatri. So what? You said tarpaulin just now. Why would I say tarpaulin? You must've thought that it was my name. What? - Tarpaulin! But you said just now your name is Chota Chatri. You said tarpaulin, so I also said tarpaulin. Let anybody say anything, don't change your name. You keep that fixed. Or else there'll be a lot of confusion. Do you understand, doughnut? Look what he took out? - Now, I'll stab you with it. Understand? If I get mad, you'll have to leave this world. Come on! - Where do we have to go? To Yeda Anna. Anna! Anna! Anna! Anna! Anna! Anna! Anna! Anna! Anna! Anna! Anna! Anna! Anna! Anna! That's Yeda Anna. - He's dancing. Anna! Anna! Anna! Anna! Anna! - Come on. Anna! Anna! Anna! Anna! Anna! Anna! Anna! - Come on. Anna! Come on. Come on. Anna! Anna! Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Anna! Anna! Anna! Anna! Anna! Tell me, Chatri. Who are these buffoons? They're imported buffoons, Anna. From New York. Have you come to meet Vikrant? No, he is a liar. We've met you, Hira Panna. It's like visiting the Mecca. Let's go. - Hey! Never try to change the subject in front of Anna. Or else I'll grate you like... Yes, sure! That shortens when we cut it. Pencil. - Maybe he is right. No. The things we eat and make juice out of. Watermelon. - Shut up! Watermelon... The thing which is like a long stick and we can make juice out of it. What do you we call it? Sugarcane! - Yes! Sugarcane! Anna will grate you like cheese and put you on a pizza. Father, he also forgets words like you. I only forget names. He forgets everything. He says you're forgetful! Hey, nameless! Quiet! It looks like we have to take you hostage. Come along. - What? What are you looking at? Come on. Hey, Chatri! - Yes? Keep an eye on them. - Yes, I'll keep a watch. I'll meet Vikrant and be back. You'll land me into trouble. Look, how clear is the water. Isn't it? - It's a... You need to change otherwise, the water will become dirty. - It's a swimming pool. Come along. Vikrant has called you. Where did you see Guru? I don't remember. Do you know the punishment for lying? Why would we lie, Mr Prashant? - Shut up, father. They won't speak like this. I will have to put a hot... - Milk! No! - Then... The thing that turns red when we heat it. - Iron rod. Yes... - Exactly! That too it's cold part. Cold part. Then what's the use of heating it? If you keep the cold part inside and the hot part outside, who will they pull it out? Yes! But how will you put it in? Should I do everything? Just go and get it. He talks so much. - I will get it. Hey! Don't get the needle. We'll tell you Mr Peda. - It isn't Peda. Say Yeda. He has come to stay in our neighbourhood. On the first day when he fought with me, I realised that he is an underworld don like you. Do we belong to the underworld? Mr Battery, I'm talking about him, not you. Say Chota Chatri! He's going to drive me crazy! Yeda, is there any proof to verify their claims? There are many proofs. First, his name is Ramu Raghavan. Second, he has a rose tattoo on the back of his neck. What is his name? Boss, if you try to understand the name, you'll forget your name. He is speaking the truth. Guru does have a tattoo. See. - Preeti! These two have seen your husband in America. Why do you look shocked? Nothing! Yeda, take both of them to America. I will go there and kill Guru. You keep the Rs 20 million ready. No. You will just go there. You will find him and inform me. I will come there, and you will kill him in front of me. Once I see him dead, I will pay you the money. Once Anna gives his word, you can be sure that I'll cut his... What do we call it? - Finger. I'm not talking about the finger. - Hair? It's not hair. Answer me, or I'll wring your neck. - Neck! Yes. Neck! Once I give my word, I'll wring Guru's neck. Sir, you can wring his neck, but how do we survive? What about our reward, Mr Sankrant? We must laugh now. Come on. Father, listen to me. Listen to me! I think we won't get a single penny of the reward. Why? - Didn't you see how they were laughing at us? I'm telling you, let's pack our bags and take the first flight to America. No. If we go back empty-handed, our wives will kill us. It's better to die at their hands. Yes. At least both of them will be hanged for it. Good idea! You, pigeons! What are you whispering? You left us, so we were waiting for you. Is that so! - Good night, Mr Raincoat. Good night. Hey, my name is Chota Chatri. If you call me by any other name, I'll stab you! Hey, hero! Go to your room and take a... Chain? A chain is in the train. Take a sheet and go to sleep! That's exactly what we'll do. Let's go. Where are you going? You go there, and you come here. Come on. - In the bathroom? How can I sleep there? There are many mosquitoes in the bathroom. You mosquito! Don't puzzle me with your questions! Understand? Until we leave for America, you'll stay with me. So that he doesn't escape! Understand! - Yes. What! Don't try to act smart! Come along. Okay, let's go. Hey! At night, do you sleep... I sleep with my clothes on. Do you bathe before sleeping? - Yes, two times. But I don't wear clothes while bathing, Mr Vinod. I have a lot of work. I have to kill Khatri in America. Understand? Don't irritate me. You fool! Hello. - Hello, Guru Gulab! Tell me! - Okay. Guru, your life is in danger. Run far away so that no one gets wind of it. Whether anyone knows it or not, I know everything. Right now, you're in Mumbai, at Hotel La Meridian, room 502. How did you know? - Relax. I know everything you're doing in Mumbai. Now, remember, your 2nd lifeline has expired. Hello? Mr Guru! Mr Gulab! He has made me tense. What do I do now? God, give me some idea! Ring a bell! God! You? Here! Don't get me wrong. I didn't want to trap your husband. I don't like dealing with the underworld. I had to come here because of Mona. - Mona? My wife, unfortunately. She loves money, not me. She wants a reward of 10 million, not me. I'm a doctor, a dentist. Look, if you don't trust me, you can ask my father-in-law. Please! I'm very scared of bloodshed. I'm telling you the truth. Even I want to go far away from this bloodshed. I want to tell you something. My father's will has tied all three of us together. Father has divided the diamonds worth 100 billion so strangely that Guru and Vikrant have become sworn enemies. Oh! Now I understand. I want you explain it to my husband, neither do I want to kill him, nor am I with Vikrant. I'm even ready to give my share of diamonds to him. Just ask him to set me free. What do you mean? - I want a divorce. You also want a divorce? Even I want a divorce. We've been married for five months. But we haven't spent any time together. We have never loved each other. He was just waiting for father to die so that he can usurp all his wealth. You're so innocent and beautiful! Yes. No one has said this to me before. Open the door! Open the door! Chota Chatri! Open the door! Open the door! - What do I do now? Do you think I'm the milkman? No. Not in the bathroom. - Here... Get under the bed! No... Are you dead? - There isn't any place here. Curtains! Hide here! - Open the door! Come on, hurry up! You don't know me! I'll break the door. Chota Chatri! - Open the door! You cat! Were you sleeping like a log? What're you doing here? - Move away! I've been knocking for so long! The other guests were glaring at me angrily! Where were you? I was in the bathroom. In the bathroom! - Yes. The bathroom is here. You can see it in the mirror also. In the mirror! Is that where you were? Don't fool me! I tell you! Pack your bags! Don't you know we have a flight to board? Pack your bags! Or else I'll stab you! You'll forget the bathroom! I smell a feminine perfume, where is it coming from? I can't smell it! Get your nose checked. I can smell ladies perfume. Was anyone here? I'm wearing perfume. You? - Yes. Ladies perfume! Yes, smell it! Hey! Stay away! Don't you come near me! Whose is this? It's mine. I wear it at bedtime. I was looking for it in the bathroom! Is that so? Don't you wear anklets? What are you saying? Come, sit. - Hey! I don't trust you. Pack your bags now! In front of me! I'll pack right away. How do I tell you? - What? Till now, I had nothing to return to India for. No purpose. - What do you mean? I mean, after spending some moments with you, I found not only a reason to come here, but also a purpose to live. What are you saying? - Come what may, Come what may, I can even give up my life, to make you happy again. Now I won't leave you. - Shut up! I'll live with your memories. - Why? I won't be at peace until you're mine. Just stop! Your empty head is a devil's workshop! You idiot! Stop speaking or else, I'll stab... Are you still stammering? I'll stab you! - Yes. Speak out! Hey! Is he your son-in-law? Do you have any doubts, Mr Damodar? Hey! Who is Damodar? Do you think I'm a fool? I'm Chota Chatri! You two are dubious men. Father-in-law and son-in-law. I understand. Go and pack your plane. We have a luggage to catch. We have a flight to catch. We've reached Singapore. Singapore! Weren't we going to America? Are you trying to hoodwink us? - Hello, listen! This is America. Why don't you clarify that? This is my first visit out of Mumbai. Not just out of Mumbai, outside the country. I knew something was amiss! Mr Yeda. I've made a blunder. What do you mean? He made a mistake! I know blunder means mistake. What have you done? I called Guru Gulab Khatri from Mumbai and told him I met Vikrant and gave his address to him. What did you say? Are you crazy? Let him go! Does he look like a crazy man? You rascal. - You're crazy! Hey! - Did you say Anna is crazy? I was very scared, so I told Guru Gulab Khatri everything. Very good! Now he'll kill you. Vipul, you've ruined us. You'll die first and then it's your turn. Me? I'm a married man! Please find a way out, Mr Crook! It isn't Mr Crook. His name is... What? You can say it tomorrow. I'm in a hurry today. Find a way out, sir! Shall we go to our house and hide under the bed? Guru Gulab will reach there before us. Now there is only one way to save ourselves. We won't go to your house. We'll go somewhere else. - Where? Why didn't Anna come with us? Anna has gone to get a horse. Will he ride on a horse? Shut up! What was the need to be so honest? Do you know what a dangerous man Guru is? It's so dark in here. Where have you brought us? Have you brought us to a theatre to watch a film? I'll switch on the light right now. But where's the switch, Chatri? Why are you asking me? Have I come here before? Look for a switch, man! Can't you find a switch? Where is it? - If you can't find the switch... Yes. I've got the switch. Is it made of rubber? You fool! The thing you're holding is my nose. It's not working. - It's not a switch. He held my nose! - The lights! How are you guys? Have you informed Vikrant about me? Please forgive us! We made a huge mistake! Guru, forgive us. We were misled! Our wives forced us. I don't have the time now. But I'll tell you my story someday. It'll bring tears to your eyes too, Mr Chela. Gun! Come on, run! He has come here! A gun here and a gun there! A gun here and a gun there! Come here. Where do we hide? Come here. Anna, take care of your gun! Don't shoot, Mr Cheda! Don't... Did I scare you? Look at their faces! Are you both friends? They seem to be childhood friends. Vikrant offered me 20 million to kill Guru. But Guru has offered me Rs 50 million to kill Vikrant. So we'll wait for him together. Let Vikrant come here. What a game! Very good! - This is great! Wonderful! Can I hug you? - Wow! Get away! Excuse me, sir. A call for you. Hello. - Hello! Why are you screaming? I can hear. - Sorry. Sir, I'm Yeda Anna. - Speak. What those two buffoons said turned out to be true. Guru lives in their neighbourhood. You catch that and come here fast. What do I catch? - That... That thing. How will I know? Please hold on. Chatri, come here. What flies in the air? Wait a minute. - A crow. Not a crow. That thing that flies. The thing we control. A kite. - Not a kite. The thing in which we sit and fly. It's even controlled by us. Just a minute. - Plane! Yes. Catch a plane and come. Did you think I'll walk to America? Hang up now. I'll reach there and tell you what to do next. Okay, sir. Didn't I tell you, somebody will lead us to Guru. He is in America. - America? What is he doing there? - He must be enjoying my money. He must be enjoying there. "You stole my heart with your killer looks." "You made me fall in love with you, O beautiful lady!" "You presence makes me feel intoxicated!" "My heart beats wildly for you!" "When you look at me with those beautiful eyes..." "When you give me that seductive smile, my heart goes wild!" "You presence makes me feel intoxicated!" "Your beauty glitters like gold!" "I have fallen head over heels for you!" "I am in love with that attitude of yours." "I am crazy for you, my beloved!" "Your beautiful eyes" "have stolen my heart," "O beloved!" "You presence makes me feel intoxicated!" "My heart beats wildly for you!" "When you look at me with those beautiful eyes..." "When you give me that seductive smile, my heart goes wild!" "You presence makes me feel intoxicated!" Vikrant will surely come here. He'll come here to die a terrible death. May I tell you one thing, Guru? Why just one thing? Say whatever you want to. It's your wish. Actually, I met your wife in Mumbai. She is very nice. I mean she is very sweet-natured. She has sent you a message. What is the message? She had nothing to do with what Vikrant did to you in Mumbai. She isn't interested in the diamonds worth Rs 10 billion, which Preeti, Vikrant and you shall get, according to her father's will. She only wants to divorce you. She only wants to divorce you. She said that if you divorce her, then her share of diamonds... Hey! Don't try to speak on my wife's behalf. Neither will I divorce her, nor will I let her go. Don't interfere in my personal matters. If you do, I'll bury you here. Hey! Let it be! Look, I wish to discuss something important with you. Let's go to your house and discuss. Come on! No. You can't stay at my place. - Why? I don't trust Vikrant. He might've sent spies after you. He'll come to know, we're in it together. Then where will we live? Shall we live on the footpath? Go and live in their house. You'll stay in my house. Okay. Where do you live? I live in front of Mr Shani's house. It's not Shani. It's Guru. - Yes, Guru. Where does Guru live? - He lives in front of our house. Where do you both live? We stay in front of each other. Why? I'll just stab him! - What happened? He is crazy, don't mind him. I don't know the police here. Or else I would've stabbed him. We are back in hell. Wow! Awe... It's great, isn't it? Why didn't you let me finish? I was about to say awesome. You will find that out when we go inside. What did you say? - In our language, we call it living hell. Don't you have any servants to pick up the bags? Don't worry. That's what we do here. I am coolie number one, and he is coolie number two. Come on. Let's pick up the bags. And get ready for a fight. Our millionaires have come. Come on, let us quickly take the millions away from them. Come in. - Come in. Come in. This is the world's most horrible corner. Our home. That is our room. The kitchen? - Yes. We live here the whole day. That is the bathroom. There is hot and cold water inside. If you want to change, start washing your clothes. Welcome. - Hey wait! What is going on? Where have you picked up these beggars from? Don't be scared. This is a routine. He is new. I'll explain to her. Darling, they are my friends from India. What's your name? This is Chota Chatri and this is Yeda Anna. They'll stay with us for a few days. Why will they stay here? Is this a lodge? You should be grateful we let you stay. Okay? Come on, get out. - Darling, listen to me. Have I ever listened to you? - No. Then why should I listen to you today? Right. Come on, both of you pick up your bags and leave. Out! Are you leaving or should I throw you out? Hey! Hey! No spitting here! He isn't spitting. The poor man stammers. This one is dumb. He can only gesticulate. - Yes. Why have you brought such dumb and sick people here? Send them to the government hospital. Go on. - Go on. Hey! I said leave right now! Get out! Out! Out! Hey, smart woman! You're babbling away, and I'm tolerating you. Just get out of my sight and let me breathe! Shut up! - You shut up! Don't scream in front of Chota Chatri. How dare you speak to my mother like this? Hey ma'am! Stop your nonsense. Keep quiet. Or else I will blow your... What do they call it? - Brain. Women don't have that. The things that Rama destroyed from Ravan's head. Arrogance. Yes! Don't show me your attitude! What are you staring at? We're going to take a bath. Before that, we want flavoured hot tea. Understand? Come on, Chota. She is staring! Anna! Guru and Vikrant are dealing with diamonds worth 10 billion and giving us a paltry sum of 50 million. Look, what we've promised Guru is our final commitment. I'm not interested in the diamonds. Wow, Anna! Today, our word has value. I've learnt a new thing from you. I really appreciate your commitment. Wow! Very good! Wow! Wow! I'm not interested in diamonds worth 10 billion. Anna is only interested in... Have some sweets, we made them ourselves. Tell us quickly. - Really? Where is Rs 20 million? Mona, the fact is that... - Hey! Eat the sweets first. Let me tell them, or else, she'll snatch the sweet out of my mouth. Nothing will happen, be brave and take a bite. Paramjeet! Wow! I didn't know you could make such tasty sweets. Forget the sweets and tell me where the money is. Mother, actually, we didn't even get a single penny. What! We're in trouble by revealing Guru Gulab Khatri's whereabouts. All the reward money will go to Yeda Anna. What? Will those men get the reward? Those men will get the reward. These sweets are enough for us. Don't touch the sweets. Keep it on the plate. Both of you go and make breakfast for the guests. Go to the kitchen! Go! I told you not to tell them before eating the sweets. I spent so much money to send them to India, and they didn't bring back a single penny. Go! We have guests at our house. Won't you take care of them? Of course, mom. You don't worry. Doctor! Doctor! Oh my God! What happened, doctor? What's the matter? Is anything wrong? Nothing. - What is all this about? What do I tell you, Tina? I've gone crazy. Ever since the underworld don Guru Gulab Khatri has been living in my neighbourhood... What? Does the underworld don, Guru Gulab Khatri live in your neighbourhood? Am I speaking in Hebrew? Why didn't you tell me before? Doctor, he is my dream man! Come on, take me to him. What happened? I've to meet him. Come on. - Tina, listen to me. What is it? Is this a home for the destitute? Why are you ringing the bell so many times? Will your father-in-law pay the electricity bill? No. I've come to introduce her to you. Are you a doctor or a pimp? Don't do such nonsense. Got it. Just get out of here! What's the matter? I'm here to meet you, not to kill you! Who is this strange girl? She is my secretary and... I know him. Age 10 years. Age 10 years? He doesn't look 10 years old. At the age of 10, he played harmonium in Gandhidham Express. Right? Was he a beggar? Has he earned all this by begging? On which train did he beg? He used to smuggle liquor inside the harmonium. From Mumbai to Gujarat and Gujarat to Mumbai. Right? He was sentenced to 2 years of imprisonment in Arthur Road jail. In two months, on the pretext of polishing the jailor's shoes, he took the jailor's gun, pointed it at his head and fled. In Bhendi bazaar, he killed Salim Talwar with a vegetable knife. She is talking too much! Mina is going to die! Tina. - Who is Tina? My secretary Tina. So, what about her? Paratha Gali don, Babu Batli, whom you chased till, Haseena lake in broad daylight, without clothes. No, he was wearing his sandals. - Really? Then you became the don of that area. Who are you? Where have you come from? Come inside. You know everything about me. You are a dangerous girl. Keep this as a token of friendship. Isn't this the gun that you used to scare Babu with? Yes, it is. Keep it. It's yours. Thanks! I noticed that you like goons and guns. Don't your parents get mad at you? My mom died when I was a kid and dad died 10 years ago. In fact, my father was in the same profession. Have you ever heard about Chiman Chappu? Are you Chiman Chappu's daughter? Yes. Are you Chiman Chappu's daughter? - Yes! Come here. Is Chiman your father? Oh, God! Is she Chiman Chappu's daughter? Oh! She belongs to a family of gangsters. He taught me how to use the knife! He is my teacher. My father was your teacher! Why don't you become my teacher? Where is my fee? Close the door before you leave. Yes. - Yes. Sure! What are you doing father? He is asking us to leave! Hurry up! Sorry! Both of you can sit and talk. We'll leave. Come on. Let's go. What? I... I brought milk for you. You drink it first. - What? I said, you drink it first. Drink it. Chatri... Hey! What do you want? Milk. I brought milk for you. You drink it first. What? I said, you drink it first. Okay... What are you laughing about? You should have drank a little. So I could also have it. You and me, turn by turn. Turn by turn. Don't you know how it's done? Go away! You should have offered me as well. But you drank the whole glass. Whole glass! What will I drink now? Tell me. Hey... Yes... You fed a snake. So that it stays loyal to me. "One who wishes to laugh and cry may fall in love." "One who wishes to be crazy may fall in love."

Is the black crow alone? No, the cuckoo is also coming with the crow. Let both of them come. We'll see. I understand. You're going to collect all the birds and open a zoo. Right? You shut up! Why do you speak? Yeda. Lay a trap in the air and seize both the birds. Cut their feathers and go to the local museum and get them stamped. You don't worry. The birds will be... Stamped! - Yes, stamped! I'll show those stamps, collect the glass stones and flee. Where are they going to flee? What are you saying? I don't understand anything. Don't you know? - What do I know? I'm asking the wrong man! Hey, doctor, this is the jargon of goons. They said, crow, which means Vikrant and cuckoo, which means Vikrant's sister. Both of them are coming to America. Both will be cooked for lunch and dinner. Understand? Did you understand, what she said? There is a party. They'll serve both lunch and dinner. Right? What kind of a party? When both come here, we'll garland them. You should garland them. We should welcome our guests. Which flower do you want? Rose, daffodil or lily? This is America. We have to book in advance. - Not a flower garland. I'm talking about the sandalwood garland, that's put on a corpse, understood? How do I know? I'm yet to die. You'll see it after you die! - That's alright. Hey! How will I see after I die? What is he saying? Then see it when I die. When are you going to die? I'll kill you before I die! If we both die, how will we see the garland? Hey, Chatri... Mr Ganna is calling you! - Stop joking! Is this an enquiry counter? Is this an enquiry counter? How many are you, in all? When my work is done, all of you will get three diamonds each. Three diamonds! - Don't scream! Preeti and... Vikrant should die. So that I can present their death certificates in the bank. Preeti! Hurry up! It's time for the flight. Yes. I'm coming. Hello? Hello! Nonsense. Come quickly, we're getting late. Come on pick up the phone. Come on! Come on! Oh no! 'British Airways announces arrival of Flight BA-949 to New York.' 'Thank you.' They have switched on so many lights! This is America! Why have we come here? To see the lighting at the airport! Why is Vikrant coming alone? Are the other people coming in the economy class? The eagle has landed. Welcome to America, Vikrant. Did you have a pleasant flight? You're not late. We've arrived just now. Shut up! Has the prey suspected any foul play? Not at all. I'm waiting for your command. If you wish... What happened? Nothing. I was simply asking if you had any problems in the flight. Let's go. Please sit. Anna, I'll see you at the hotel. Then we'll chalk out our plans. Okay. Hey you. Sit. - Okay. You were thrown out! It's bound to happen if you sit in others' cars. Come on! Sit in our car. Come on! Don't look there. She has gone. Come on, Guru. Start it. The black crow has landed in the trap. Very good. Where are you taking both of them? The Grand Hyatt. I'll help him to check-in and come back. Okay? We'll talk when you get here. Okay, Guru. Vikrant, the top floor suite has been booked. You don't have to worry about your safety. Don't worry about Vikrant's safety. Wherever he goes, his security reaches before he does. You only think about Guru. Come on, sister. Hey, you! You'll stay with me. No, I can go anywhere during the day, but I've to be home at night. You don't know my wife. - Shut up! You. Little umbrella, you. Me? Boss, I can't sleep on a new bed. You won't sleep. You'll stay awake. So that, I can sleep peacefully. What do you think Anna? That's right. - That's right. You stay with him so that you can keep a watch on his moves. Okay? - Alright! Don't move! Hold it! Let him go! What are you doing? Hey, come on. Move! He has booked the entire top floor. And said that it can't go to the top floor. What can't go to the top? What is it called? The thing that goes up and down on pressing a button. Umbrella. - Yes, umbrella. No, not umbrella. The things that can handle 4-5 people at once. Hey! Don't say such things. Women are here. I didn't mean that. How do I explain it? What is it called? - Elevator. Elevator. - Elevator! And he said. - No one can access the top floor. You don't worry, Yeda. I'll take care of him. His guards stand outside the elevator! I'll go and climb the walls like a lizard at night. I'll beat him up in his room! I'll bash him up at midnight. Hey Guru! - What happened? Hey Guru! Hey, Chatri! What are you doing here? What would I do there? I asked you to keep a watch on Vikrant. Vikrant was kidnapped by Guru's men. Who kidnapped him? The Chinese goons you sent. Which Chinese goons did I send? Does he look like a Chinese man! Does he look like a Chinese? Who sent them? Wait! Listen, did the goons that had come to kidnap, leave a visiting card? - Shut up! Chatri, shut up! First we have to find out, where those Chinese goons have taken Vikrant. Then we have to go to China to look for him. We can go, but I don't know Chinese. Hello? - Can you speak Chinese, Mr Mangal? Shut up! Shut up. - Hello? Vikrant has been kidnapped. - What? Who are we going to kill? Where will we get the death certificate from? How will we get the diamonds from the bank? If we don't get those diamonds, then I won't get 3 diamonds. You never execute a single job properly, Mr Railroad. I see that from the beginning. You never execute anything properly. - It isn't his fault. The entire plan was hatched by Yeda Anna. It was a crazy plan. No, mom. It was Guru's mistake. Guru's plan was full proof. Understood? I don't care what Guru's plan was... The mess that has been... No, that's not true. Anna is the one who made the plan. Everything has gone wrong. - Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Quiet. Quiet. Quiet. Listen. Whose call was it, Yeda? Guru that Vikrant turned out to be our...

I'm so thrilled. Take them out. I've never seen real cherries. Take out some cherries. You and your dry sense of humour. They're diamonds, Take them out. Why do you want my permission? Take them out. Hey! Why are you asking each other to take it out? Where is the bag? Yeda, where is the bag? I don't have it. Chatri, take out the bag. Okay, boss! Aunt, take it out! I don't have it. - You don't? No. I remember. I threw the bag towards Mona. Hey, Mona darling, take out the bag. I don't have it. - What? I mean, I had it. But when those goons came after me, I threw the bag towards my sweetheart. What are you saying? Did you give me the bag? Come on Anna, don't try to take away the whole loot. Come on, take out the bag. - Hey! At least give me my share of 3 diamonds, please. I remember, when I was saving Tina, I gave the bag to Manilal. Then catch hold of Manilal, Mr Idiot. Why are you staring at me like this, Mr Raincoat? Hey! Chota Chatri! - Who is Chota Chatri? My name is Chota Chatri. - So, what should I do? Don't try to fool me, Manilal. Hey! He is Manilal. I told you. Get hold of him! You're Manilal! But you said you're Manilal. Manilal! - But you said you're Manilal. Take out the diamonds. I don't have the diamonds. You idiot, if they are not with you, then who has the diamonds? Should I take out my knife? No. I remember. Popatlal. Who is Mr Popatlal? Who is Mr Popatlal? - Popatlal? Who is this Popatlal? The one who was fighting. Fighting? - What is his name? Fevicol. Fevicol! - Fevicol! Have you given the diamonds to Vikrant's men? You've taken so many names, who is it Popatlal or Fevicol? Ranipal. Ranipal. - Who is Ranipal? Rekha's husband. Who is Rekha? - My daughter. Oh! He has given it to Anmol. - My daughter. That is what I was telling him. - Anmol. You've got me totally confused. - Anmol. How many names do we look for? Now that you have the name, take out the diamonds. But Anmol is missing! Think again, Anmol. Guru can be very dangerous when he's angry. He can kill you. No, Preeti. I can't go back now. I had promised to make you happy again. This is the right time. Hello. - I'm Anmol. Where have you flown to and where are the diamonds? Preeti and the diamonds are with me, Guru. What are you doing there? Come here! No, Guru. - No? We have made a decision. - What have you decided? We don't want you to be a part of our lives now. What do you mean to say? I mean I don't want to live with Mona. If you don't want to live with Mona, why tell me? Go and tell your wife. Bring the diamonds here. Preeti also wishes to free herself from her marriage. Forget about Preeti. Bring the diamonds here! I'll give you the diamonds, but on one condition. What is the condition? You'll have to separate from Preeti. Mona's monkey! Are you laying down conditions for Gulab Khatri? I won't divorce her. What will you do? What's more important to you, the diamonds or Preeti? I love the diamonds! Okay. Then sign the divorce papers and come to the docks at 5 pm. A second-rate dentist is ordering Gulab Khatri to get a divorce! It's impossible! What... Tina! You cheater! Flirt! I was blinded by your love. The woman you don't even love, you didn't spend a single moment with her after marriage, you didn't even touch her! The marriage is a farce. You don't want to divorce her, just because you think no one can order you! I didn't expect this of you. Tina. - Absolutely not! For the first time in my life, I've thought about someone other than me. And that is you. Yes. Come on. Yeda, you're betraying your boss. Hey, shut up! You ditch people yourself. You don't have to teach me about honesty! Do you think Anna is a fool? You'll have all the fun with Rs 100 billion and I'll be left to rot with Rs 50 million. Come on, take it out. What are you staring at? Anna! I'm coming. Just a minute. Guru, you want to take our diamonds. I won't spare you. Just wait! Anna! Anna! Anna! Come on. Yeda, over here. I've had enough of your smartness! Come on throw the bag. Quickly! Come on throw the bag. Quickly! - Anna, give him the diamonds, there is nothing we can do. Be comfortable, Yeda. Please maintain your balance. Chatri. - Yes. Take care of your boss. - Yes. Everything depends on your shoulders. Okay? Why are you trying to make me tall? At least give me that! What is it called? What is it called? How would he say it? Give me a stool at least! Don't move, or else Yeda will be no more. Yes. - And listen, Yeda. The world knows that Guru Gulab Khatri keeps his word. We made a deal of Rs 50 million. Look, these are diamonds worth Rs 50 million. Take these. And I have a special offer for you. 3 diamonds for each of you. Free! I'll leave. Okay. Bye. "Turn around and look at me before you leave!" Guru! Guru! Anna. Anna. Can you hold your breath for five minutes? I'll collect the diamonds. Shut up! I'm trapped because of you. I'll die if you move. Anna, I've adjusted with you, my entire life. Can't you adjust for five minutes? - Don't move. Four minutes? - I told you not to move. I'll be back soon. - Don't move. Stand straight. I'm trapped because of you. Don't move. Diamonds! What are you doing? First, help me. Cut the rope! Anna! - Idiot! What happened? Why are you so sad? Nothing. I was just thinking that... What? That we are going to India, but I've nothing to offer you. I don't even have a house. I can't give you, anything but my love. You can give me your love, can't you? Who said you're homeless? You have such a big heart. I'll live in it. Stupid girl! When you get the grocer's bill, love won't pay for it. You need to pay for it in cash. Father, you? Yes, your father. Look at this! What are you doing in these clothes? Forget the clothes. Take this. What is this? - Why do you ask questions? Keep it. Diamonds! Who gave you these diamonds? - I'll tell you. His name was... I forgot the name, God! The fact is... I've not done anything. My son-in-law is like that. My son-in-law is like that. I haven't done anything. - Shut up! Shut up! - I haven't done anything. I haven't done anything. - Shut up! It hurts! It hurts! Take this. Preeti's share of diamonds. Your diamonds are also in it. You're really a good man. - Hey! Don't abuse me. Don't say I'm good. Guru never takes anything which belongs to others. Understand? Okay. Okay. Come, let's have coffee. - No. Come, please. Let's have coffee. - No coffee. Please come. - I'm fasting today. Come on, please just, one cup. - I'm fasting for my marriage! I never thought that Guru could change for the good. You enjoy your diamonds. Why worry about other things? Anmol and Preeti, live happily forever. Father, you are wonderful! - Why? You spoke our names correctly. What are you saying? Yes. - Yes. Yes. This is magic. Look, as soon as he got the diamonds, Jayantilal's problem also got solved. Manilal! - Who is Manilal? Oh God! "Come to me, my darling." "Come to me, my darling." "Carefree, mad..." "Carefree, mad, lover." "Come to me, my darling." "Come to me, my darling." "You stole my heart with your killer looks." "You made me fall in love with you, beautiful lady!" "I'm all alone. I'm in trouble." "Come to me, my darling." "Come to me, my darling." "No one will be spared by us here." "The whole world calls us carefree, mad lovers."
