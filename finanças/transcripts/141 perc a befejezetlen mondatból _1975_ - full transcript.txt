From Germany. Court of Dortmund in the case of the attempt on the life of SS leader Geidinger announced today three death sentences. Let's listen to another song, Leitner. She went away with that elderly lady. Your Excellency surely remembers. They must have left around 11 together, and when Mr. Kövér returned outraged after midnight, he was looking for Your Excellency. Wanted to know the address of the old lady, since his golden clock-chain has disappeared. He said that the lady stole it, and he came back to ask her address from Your Excellency. - From me? - The lady told him You have been here already. Where? Did he know my name? Certainly not. He might have assumed... ... but do not bother with it please. - Can I bring You another one? - Yes, please do. This one will be good enough. This is a suitable place for us. It's dirty enough. Too many people here, Miklós. It's Saturday, the plebs is gathering. Let's cancel this bet, Miklós. - I resign. - I don't! - Your wine-and-soda, Your Excellency. - Waiter! - Yes, please. - What's your name? - They call me waiter or head waiter. Depending on whether Your Excellency wishes to order, or pay. - I asked you your name! - What the hell.. - Who is this person. - I'm sorry but I did not understand Your Excellency. - I can tell you my name, of course. - But I'd rather send it by post to Your Excellency. - I wouldn't like others to hear it. - Plenty of drunkards gather here around this time. - If they get to know my name, then there is no end to drink to our friendship. - I'll be back in a moment, Your Excellency. - I think this one played it low on you. - This one's also just another dirty Bolshevik. - Just like the others. - Bloody hell. Who is this? - Leave it, Miklós. - I certainly won't, my sweet brother. - You have to lead this plebs to a dance once. Sitting here, getting drunk, drinking their weekly wage away, and meanwhile they're complaining about unemployment, and that capitalists are skinning them. - Shut him up already... - There's the first one. Who was it? These are all cowards. One by one and all together. Stop that radio! Come on, who was it? They need order, not democracy, my friend. Indeed. Order. And a couple of slaps in the face. From time to time. What's your name? János Nagy. You're a Bolshevik too, right? - No, Your Excellency. - But you are! And if you are, then why are you wearing a tie? A tie belongs to a bourgeois wear, my dear brother. - And a Bolshevik should not wear a tie. What's your name! So you are not answering. Then you are a Bolshevik too. - Take off your ties. - This man is drunk. - He has to be thrown out. - I will step into the mouth of this one. Take off your tie! Get lost now or you might not be able to leave on your legs. - You dirty pig. - Calm down, boys! -... - If you have some sense you don't hurt him. - Don't let yourselves to be tricked. He's provoking. - This one wants something. - This one knows what he wants. - An intelligent working man does not let himself be tricked by such people. Béla is probably right, this one's a sneak. Indeed, a sneak. - He is. - Take off your ties. - What's happening. Give me your IDs. Ask for his ID, officer. Look at his hand. What do you want with that scissor. Give it to me. - Your name? - Miklós Vidovics. - Give me your ID. - Here it is. - Who started this? - This man. - Saturday night again, finally. - Look Sir. -Mr. Józsi, give me the 8 o'clock and the Borsszem Jankó please. What can we think, Sir? Why didn't she come the past two weeks? She does not come exactly on the day when she is accused to have stolen a golden chain. Since then there is no sign of her. What should we be thinking? Where is the 8 o'clock and the Borsszem Jankó, Mr. Józsi? Just a moment, Lady Hupka. Go go go, you too. Please leave the premises. - Guess! - I don't want to guess. - Take your hands off my eyes, or I will ask Mr. Józsi to go get the police. - That would be good, it's been a while since anything fun has happened. - But you always know and you never want to guess. - Are you hungry? - Yes. Józsi! Two paprika potatoes. What's with the newspapers? - Speak, mother. - I know you are awake. Did you switch off the light in the bathroom, Désirée? How many more times will you ask me that? I think I will write to uncle Lolo to go to the flat and take a look. - In case it is left switched on somewhere. - Go ahead.. Write to him.. - Wouldn't you tell us what's in that suicide note? Please, mother, don't cry. We are going to have to start this conversation once. I want to know what he wrote before his death. I know that aside from your name, mine and Lőrinc's was on the envelope, too. You don't have the right to keep it from us. What did he write in the letter? Is it true about the suicide? I demand an answer. I cannot bear you talking to me in this tone. I haven't slept for three days. You should take this into consideration. I can't bear it. You think only about yourself. - I want to know if it's true that he embezzled. - My god. - Désirée, quietly, for God's sake. Someone's going to hear it! Are you afraid that your lover might hear it? Do you know how Jacky calls me? Wild virgin, that's what he calls me. He hates tstill a virgin. He says that when we get married, he does not want to deal with this on our wedding night. Why shouldn't I spare you the sorrow. Although it is true that your father embezzled, What's that look? Didn't you know? The whole town talks about this. Of course it might not be true. Even if it's true. And indeed it is a great shame. You should still be relieved about what the whole family knows, but nobody talkes about. Namely that he was not your father, my child. Lőrinc surely must have known. But he is well mannered, I don't think he would have told. Right, Lőrinc, my dear? You knew! You knew that our mother is a whore? Oh, please. You blushed completely. Oh, please. I'm the virgin and yet it is always you who blushes. Yes? Désirée.. pardon. Come come, why are you terrified? I will start a new life tomorrow but first I'll dress up as a fool, right? - Aunt Irma's letter. The bank is not paying, Uncle Jenő disappeared. - Sit down. - As you know, I hate birds. I became sentimental only because of the broken wing, please. I hope it is an appreciable achievement. Yesterday evening Stevo, a tall, stupid, black haired naval officer. Today Van Derthuysen dutch engineer, 90 kilos. Two days, two lovers. What do you think, will it be enough for Jacky? In a few years Désirée forgot most of what's happened to her in Dubrovnik. Yet the magic memory of the late afternoon hours lived on in her so vividly, that after 27 years, after the death of her husband, the engineer Van Derthuysen, when she was in bed seriously ill in Rotterdam, she ordered leaflets about Pension Argentina. Although she had a high fever, she took a train, and died in her former room. Aunt Désirée in Dubrovnik At that time Lőrinc has been dead for 17 years already. The family received the last picture about him in 1944. The photo arrived after his death. It was sent by Miklós Vidovics. Lőrinc was executed three days after the photo was taken. If you wish, Désirée, I can stay for one more week, Seven more wonderful nights. You think so? As far as I'm concerned, You can stay as long as you wish. Don't stand, sit down. - Is this that Dutchman? - Yes. - Good morning. ... Hello. - Hello, good morning. - Did you sleep well? - Very well, thank you. - This is Stevo, the beau...This is my brother. - Hello, how do you do. - Hello. - I want to swim to Lacroma. Is it far from here? - ... - One hour, not much at all. But it is a little dangerous, ... There are lot of great fishes. How shall I say, so great, big fishes. They are coming in from the sea. You know, very, very dangerous. Sharks? All the more interesting. - You come with me, won't you? No, no, me not. - Kellner. Kellner, bitte. - Madam. - Did you see the Wiener Journal? - What will be with that 8 o'clock newspaper and the Borsszem Jankó, Mr. Józsi? - This boundless impudence! - I'm by no means willing to guess. Put down your hands. You can't guess, can you? - No, I can't./N - Hello, Uncle Béla. - Hello, how are you? - She doesn't want to talk. That the letter is addressed to her. She's lying as if she was playing bridge. When I asked her to at least show me the envelope, she said she cannot find it, maybe she left it in Pest. - May I introduce myself, Miss Parcen Nagy? I'm Professor Wavra. - How do you feel in Dubrovnik? Have you been to Kupari, Miss Parcen Nagy? Before yesterday we walked over there, but it was long for Laura. Although she foretold the day before that it would be too much. But she did not arm in time, as Machiavelli advises the prophets. That's why she could not deal with my cunning and aggressive nature. Thus both of us started to limp. Laura out of conviction, me out of vanity. We won't hold you up any more, Miss Parcen Nagy, surely You are accustomed to livelier walks. So this is my father. The lover of my mother for 20 years, who I don't remember the last time when he kissed me. He has a splendid head, doesn't he? I hope the scirocco ... ...won't bring rain. Hopefully. But it will surely bring two dozen german refugee families. The ones who went to Korcula today. The guests are not welcome, I think. Who invited them? You should show some sympathy towards them, here in Dubrovnik, there are also enough German refugees, whom you can meet. No, thanks. I don't discuss politics. It's not true, Mr. Schweichart, that you don't discuss politics. Only you are so tactful, that nobody notices that you have an opinion. - Who is he?/N - Mr. Kühler, from Berlin. The day before yesterday we went on the same ship to Split. - Where are you from, Mr. Schweichart. - From Marburg. People don't have opinions there? They probably do. Then tell me, why are you afraid of the fact that my father, the world-known dermathologist was put in a concentration camp just because he is a jew. Not all questions need to be answered. Don't let yourself to be provoked by a jewish girl. He was swept away. Lőrinc! The waves took him. He has to be fished out before he drowns. Lőőrinc! Désirée please, I'm sorry. Can I help you, please? Uncle Jenő escaped abroad. There is a warrant against him. 4000 people were fired on Csepel. The anxiety among the workers is worrying. Allegedly they are preparing a strike. I think I have to leave immediately, please. Yes, I think you have to leave immediately, please. It is better to see it personally, please. What do I care what's happening in Pest. I don't want to hear anything. I don't care. Would you tell us what happened? Oh, he left me, he has left this morning. I will never see him anymore. Désirée, don't leave. Don't leave, stay with me. Lőrinc, Lőrinc. My little son. I'm going to Pest by train tonight. Give me the letter of my father. Give me the letter. I demand that you give it to me. Dear Laura, I don't want to hurt you with this letter, which I am not writing for others to judge you. However, the fact, that I die today out of my own free will, which I've decided definitely and about which I don't want to change my mind, concerns Désirée and Lőrinc as much as it concerns You. Thus I address the letter to all of You, which, however, still concerns you mostly, with whom the old memories and the 20 years of hatred that came after the boredom, connect me more than my doubly suspicious paternity connects me to the two young beings who - to mislead ourselves and others - we used to call our children. As we won't have any more opportunities, I want to hereby thank you for the discretion that you have expressed with your choice of connecting Professor Wavra as a third person to our family. When 20 years ago, coming home one evening, the first time that I found cigarette ashes in the ink tray of my table, and next to it a knocked over Waterman bottle from which the ink was still leaking, I was astonished about this absent-mindedness which I classified as negligence, or even ruthlessness that time, later though, when I found Prof. Wavra's dirty handkerchief among my papers, or the dirty foot-print of his shoes on my sofa, I started to feel suspicious about myself, about my unhealthy meticulousness, which wanted to achieve order by all means. I accept that this is hard to tolerate, so let's just smile about the stupid assumption, that I shot myself in the head- or in the heart, i don't know yet- because somebody in my flat left the light on for 16 years, and with his fondness for garlic langosh he filled my flat with an unbearable smell of fat. These are all unimportant compared to that all I know about him was for my liking. His patriotic propaganda during the war, his brave anti-militarism during the October Revolution, and last but not least, that during the Commun he drew the consequences of his new ideology, and entered the Red Army, then in less then a year he became an angry racist and a whole-hearted anti-Semite. In 1917 I gave you 20 000 crowns for the Augusta Fund; I was not sorry to hear that you gave it to Prof. Wavra, to the anti-Slavic propaganda centre organized by him. I gave it to him with the same good feeling - with your discreet mediation - as one year later 60 000 crowns for the aims of the League Defending Human Rights, or then a few months later half a million for the communist party. The reliability of his orientation skills was always the object of my admiration. I trusted him blindly. Rare luck is to be able to spend even an hour with such a person, and I had the luck at that time. So my decision, dear Laura, is not related to him. Simply, it has been enough. Nowadays, during the evenings, when I think about returning home and saying goodbye to my driver switching of the lights from room to room, sweeping the ash off my table, collecting the paper fragments of Prof. Wavra from the carpet, going to bed, sleeping some, and knowing that the next day all of it starts from the beginning, I have a feeling deceptively resembling boredom. Maybe if I stayed next to my table for a few more years, the Trust could avoid the collapse that my unexpectedly fast departure and the related unpleasant discoveries will make imminent. But I have lost interest. It was enough. I don't feel anymore the beat of life behind the numbers, as before. And the fate of the 8000 workers, I admit, concerns me as much as the fate of our large family, whose nauseating untrue familial love I endured harder and harder as time went on. I hope my lawyer will save at least a fragment of my wealth for you. What's happening today? They are crawling like lice. We will miss the last bus. What was in the leaflet, Fisher? What do I know. I don't give a shit about politics. It was put in my pocket. I threw it away. I've read it. The factory went bankrupt due to the embezzlement of 6 million. Who believes that. I won't let myself to be fooled. Good for you, Mr. Fisher. Your wife cooks with horse fat, so that the four of you survive on that weekly 12 pengő you take home. and that Parcen Nagy needed 6 million. Stand up for yourself, Mr. Fisher. Just stand in the rain and take off your coat. Let your back be wet as well. Not just the engineer. Your tongue is wagging, Mrs Rózsa. I've been standing at the casting mould for 20 years. They know who I am. Nobody can fool me. If the others are fired, you will be too. They won't keep the factory operating just for your sake. - Except if you ask them kindly. - Or send your children to them. Solidarity is the garb of a worker, Mr. Fisher. Our kind must never lose it. Do you know what they do with your husband. For 3 weeks every day they beat him until he bleeds. They beat him like hell. What help is solidarity for him. He is better off until he is beaten. They will stop beating him when he talks. So they better beat him. What the hell is going on so that we cannot move? - It's almost quarter to, we are going to miss the bus. - What's going on there up front? They want to close the factory. If this happens the only way is to show our power and occupy the factory. What? What did he say? If they close the factory, the workers will occupy it. - Who is talking? - Who cares? What matters is that he is here and says what has to be said. - Let me go. - Occupying the factory? What would we win with that? They will call the military and we can go to hell. How the fuck will we get home today? - To hell with you! The police will shoot into the crowd in five minutes. Let me out of here. Let me go. Stop. Stop! Didn't you hear it? Stop! Stop immediately! Didn't you hear? You beat your mother? You are a proletar too, son. Shut up! - Stop! Stop! - The hell with you. To hell with you! Bloody brat! - What are you doing, mister? /N - What are you doing here? Hands up! - Here is your drink, Your Excellency. - Thanks. Why are you interested? Did you know Béla? - It's me who has found the body. - I know about it. - You want to know who the killer is? - Yes. - I could say a thing or two about this. This boy has been investigating this already for a month. He liked Béla very much. Did you perhaps, find out who killed him? Miklós Vidovics. Vidovics? Him. I don't believe it. Why would he do it? Come on, it's a complete nonsense. What's the problem, Péter? There is no problem. I want to talk with Uncle Józsi. Come here then. - Hi, brother. - Hi. My nephew. His mother is the sister of poor Béla, the one we are talking about. Maybe you should introduce yourself. I'm Péter Rózsa, good evening. Does Sir know if the Tram 49 will take me to Retek street? I don't know, but it's final stop is Keleti station. Behind the transformer building. Mrs. Rózsa! - What's going on with you? - Whatever. It's been three days since you haven't been home. I'm also Rózsa. The father of this boy is my younger brother. Well, what do you want to talk about with me? Do we have to talk here? Where else? Well uncle Jozsi, could you please lend me two pengős. What do you need 2 pengős for? I told you already... My father does not know about this. He was taken by the police more than three weeks ago. - Taken again? - Yes. But then he was released only recently. What are you shouting for? Go home and send your mother tomorrow. This is not possible. She's also been caught two days ago. Her too? Great. They cannot keep still. You know, Your Excellency, both of them are organized good workers. However, if someone is a socialist... My parents are not socialists, they are communists. Well, go home my boy, I will go over to your place tomorrow. I don't recommend it. The whole house is being watched. During the night Mr. Fischer was pulled out from his bed because they accused him of having participated in the sabotage at Csepel. - There was a sabotage at Csepel yesterday?/N - It's not sure, a 50 ton crane has derailed and fell on the furnace. But Mr. Fischer does not have anything to do with the crane. Where do you live, Péter? Béla Ország street 41. Do you know what happened to your uncle Béla? He was killed. Did you like him? I did. What kind of a person was he? Like the other workers. What do you think, why was he killed? Did he have enemies? With politics. Workers are killed with politics. And workers also kill with politics. You tongue is wagging, son. - Here is one pengő. Thank you, but it's of no use to me. - What do you need it for?/N - I need it for caution, I want to deliver newspapers for the evening Kurír. Here is another. Thank you, I will pay it back in a month. Can we prepare for closing, Your Excellency? Yes, yes. Could you please Please accept this from me, Péter. What... - Say thank you, 50 pengős, Mr. Parcen, His Excellency, gives this to you. - Who? Parcen Nagy? I cannot take money from a bourgeois. - Good evening. - Good evening. Stupid. Stupid! - Aunt Irma! - Désirée! - Welcome. Show yourself. - You are looking good./N - Welcome./N - Hello, Désirée. - How are you? /N Thank you, I'm perfectly well. - When did you come, if I may ask?/N - Before yesterday, I hurried. - I did not want to miss this big day./N - That was a good decision, my child. - I hear you've been to Napoli as well./ N - Only ten days. Three weeks in Capri, that's where I've met Jacky, we went to Siracusa together. That's where we have been the longest, it was wonderful. We've been sailing, sunbathing, we've been swimming a lot. Your daughter has changed, Laura, She has grown more beautiful. For God's sake, Laura, don't eat that much. There, there! Only a trifle. That's the ninth sandwich so far. Lest they don't make harm. Tell me, my darling, did you bring Károly's letter? - Yes./N A tea, Your excellency Parcen Nagy? - Yes, please. How long since they haven't seen each other? - Almost 20 years./N 20 years, my god. Can you imagine that 20 years of hate - can be reversed in one afternoon? /N She brought it, Mother. What, my son? She has the letter here with her. Good, my child. Is everybody here already? - Not yet, Mother. We are still waiting./N - You slut! You dare cheat on my son! Before you married into our family, you did not even know what a bidet is used for. A woman kept him, your excellency. that poor woman was really crazy about this ponce. in the end they were fighting too much, Vidovics was bored with the woman. Three weeks ago he left her indeed. And she was completely worn out. She could not bear the competition. She thought that the gate closed for her for good. Thus I could worm myself into her confidence. You know how this goes. I took it out from her. She admitted that during that evening when she woke up the bed was empty next to her, and the window open. This is that window, your excellency. Why do you think that I'm lying. I'm not lying to your excellency. I want only one thing, the killer of Béla brought before the court. - I'm not lying, please believe me, what reason would I have. - Géza! - Come here. - Jenny! - You see. Won't you come in for a short time? Come on. Well? Waste of effort, what Irma has put into this gathering. What can we expect from this day? You cannot be serious in thinking that either Laura, or Grandmother after 20 years did not forget that particular case with the bidet that the family blows up so much. You whore! You dared to cheat on my son? You cheap slut! You, who before marrying among us, did not even know what a bidet is used for. I would very much like to know, your excellency if you are ready to report at the police? What do you think about me, you stupid idiot? That I would send Miklós into prison? It doesn't help the working class that from time to time the police hangs a worker-killer. Béla was my best friend, we lived together. It is not possible to tell how good he was. Even my mother was not that good with me. Why are you not willing to report? Elemér! What is it with you, Elemér? - What do you think about Miklós, Elemér? I find it amazing, I don't even believe it. - The trial will be tomorrow. Yes, I've read it. - I haven't seen him in years, do you meet with him sometimes? - Not much. It seems that today finally the big reconciliation will happen. Here I am, mother. What are you saying? Why don't you speak up? She became hoarse from the excitement, mother. She asked mother to forgive her. Like Károly forgave her before his death. She said all that? Sit down, my children. Well. The reconciliation of two old women who have experienced and suffered a lot is not an uncommon sight. And how old are you, my darling? - 41. - Right, right. She was 18 and Károly was 38 when 23 years ago he lead her to the altar. And Károly would be 61 in a month if he would still be alive. 23 years ago, my God! I hope in 23 years you've learnt what a bidet is good for. Admit it, my son, that you didn't know. Why did you need to be offended so much about this. Admit it, my son. This is the least I deserve so that you don't refute me like you did 20 years ago. Well, repeat after me: I admit, mother - I admit - What did you say? I did not understand. I admit. One has to treat her like a child. I raised ten children. I hope God forgives me. C'est son metier. I still know more about young people than these frivolous women. Did you bring the letter of Károly, my son? Take this, my darling. It contains english drops. - I heard that this is the fashion nowadays./N - No, thank you. It's a shame as it is marvelous. Why don't you introduce your daughter, my child? She is lovely, the little girl. Even though she does not wear mourning, but that's understandable. Even if she is not a blood relative, we won't turn our backs on her. I know her, a really pretty and lovely girl. Though, It can be seen at first sight that she did not take after Károly. Why does she remain sitting, for God's sake? She must be ill. - I will take her by her arm and pull her out. I forbid you to interfere. The little girl is called Désirée, If I know well. Sadly, during 18 years, there was nobody to introduce her. Where is her father? Whose father? Your daughter's father, I'm talking about Professor Wavra, my darling. Est-ce qu'il decouche, le ???? Maybe he does not want to marry you? Maybe he is afraid that you don't have any money? Give me already my sons letter, how many more times do I have to ask. - I did not bring it./N -You didn't? - When I asked you before.../N - Yes! Yet I did not bring it. I knew that the whore wouldn't bring it. What could my son have written so that she does not dare to show it. What must he have suffered next to her my only dear son. Your excellency, madame, the police. Good afternoon! We are looking for Elemér Parcen Nagy. - That's me. /N - We have a warrant to arrest you. What? My son? Why? House search warrant. Where is your room, Mister? Behind the library room. Come with us please, your excellency, Parcen Nagy. What do you want with my son? Why are you taking him? This must be a mistake, a misunderstanding. - Where are they taking my son?/N Irma! Don't interfere, please. Why was he arrested? He was involved in a communist organization. Does the persecutor have any questions to the witness? Do you remember, that Béla Markot called the accused a police informer, or described him as such? Yes, I remember. Thank you, I have no more questions. The defense? Didn't his Excellency Parcen Nagy have the impression as if the accused was under the influence of drink when he arrived to the pub? I did not notice, although I cannot rule it out. In the statement you made at the police, you mentioned that when the accused stepped out from the pub, he turned back from the door and smiled kindly at the workers. Yes. I would like to phrase my message clearly. I had the impression that someone smiling so kindly at his enemy, is probably not offended too much and is likely not planning revenge. As far as i can judge, Mr. Vidovics could not have any reason to kill Béla Markot. - As he defended him. - Thank you, I have no more questions. Please take a look, this is the window, your excellency. Now tell me, is it a problem to jump out through this? At night, in cold wet weather when nobody is on the street. There will be someone to report him, don't worry. I will make sure of it. You don't need to be pompous. You also just live from what your father has stolen. Having the right to the last word, does the accused have anything else to say? Honorable court, your excellency the president, I would like to state that against all semblance, I am innocent. Let me briefly summarize the trial. The court interrogated six witnesses, five of whom testified in favor of me, and one against me. Sándor Reitner restaurant owner, Mr, József Rózsa and Mr. Parcen Nagy unambiguously testified that I've left the restaurant at 10.30 pm. Mr. Géza Feleki testified under oath that he escorted me to my home. Pálné Kakas house porter also testified under oath that she opened the gate for me before 11 pm. Naturally the unambiguous statement of five witnesses grants me a perfect alibi in vain if there is a sixth witness testifying that I've jumped out the window. My misfortune lies in the fact that Mrs. Timmerman lives in a ground floor flat, about which even a child can determine that its position makes it possible to jump out from its window. But how can it be proved that I indeed jumped out? There is only one witness of that, Mrs. Timmerman. However, Her statement can hardly be regarded as unbiased, as our relationship in that time was the worst possible. The witness was generally known to be my lover. Two weeks after the murder in question I broke our relationship and moved to the flat of Miss Kisteréz at Személynök street as a tenant. From this Mrs. Timmerman evidently deduced that I have a love affair with my landlady. This was naturally a completely arbitrary and subjective assumption without any factual base or goodwill. Mrs Timmerman, whom I considered to be a clever woman with an intelligence above average, led by her personal temper, probably blinded by jealousy, here in front of the court, I ask you to withdraw your false testimony! It is not possible that at the age of 23 you want to get me a life sentence in prison. - Jenny! - Don't terrorize the witness, otherwise I withdraw the right to speak from you. - The witness testified under oath. - I don't have the intention to terrorize her, Mr. President. Jenny! Don't hate me, tell the truth! Or you want my fall at all costs, Jenny? I would like to speak, Mr President. - What does she want? - The witness wants to supplement her testimony, the rules make this possible. You have the right to do this, Mrs. - I wonder what she will say now. Honorable court, I want to change my testimony. I warn the witness that she testified under oath, she should think over what she says. Otherwise, I will bring charges against her for misleading the authorities and for false testimony. I object against the Prosecutor intimidating the witness. Silence! I order questioning of the witness once again. Mrs Timmerman, come forward. My dear Jenny, bravely. I want closed trial, Mr. President. Silence! Why? A woman is sitting among the audience, in whose presence I cannot talk. I ask for her being led out. I don't want to object the truth. Don't dare to touch me. Don't dare to touch me! Aaah!! She has fainted. Mrs. Timmerman, if you don't come here, I have to suspend the trial. I feel better already, Mr. President. Excuse me. I've lost my head. That woman. She stole the happiness of my life. Do you allow me to sit down? Please. I withdraw my testimony. your excellency Mr. President, honorable court, it is not true that Mr. Vidovics jumped out the window. I made a false testimony. Please lock me up, Mr. Prosecutor. I wanted to take revenge on him because he left me. I ask you to acquit him. As Mr. Vidovics is completely innocent. Ten years later, in the middle of the last year of the war, Lőrinc, hiding as a war deserter, following an anonymous report, in a countryside town's hotel, the door was bursted open on him. And as he attempted resistence, he was executed. Four days before his death he accidentaly met Vidovics on the street whom he did not see for long years. As if the playful whim of chance connected two of his friends' fate, right on the same day did he read in the newspaper that his nephew Elemér was appointed to be a under-secretary at the Ministry of the Interior. The news surprised both of them, they had different opinions about it. Vidovics married a hotel owner, lived from her wealth, due to his alcoholism, the first signs of liver-cirrhosis where visible. In their long talk into the night he admitted to Lőrinc, that he killed Béla Markot. As he said he did it because he considered it intolerable that he called him a provocator. Vidovics sent the picture, without mentioning the death of Lőrinc, to the family as a memory. Lőrinc in 1944 october with Miklós V. and his family in Szentes. Hallo? Yes, yes. Unfortunately, I'm not available this afternoon and in the evening I'm going to a concert. No, no, by no means. Tomorrow? What is happening tomorrow? Yes, for example tomorrow at noon is good. Yes, between 12 and 1 pm anytime if it is good for you. Yes yes. Good, then tomorrow at 12 in the Gerbaud. Good-bye. I'm sorry. Your Excellency, Parcen Nagy! - How is your dear mother? - Thank you for asking. In one of these days I will pay her a visit. - May I invite you for a coffee? - Please. Anyway I wanted to visit her for a long time. I will go, I will. They don't understand that the Habsburg restauration is not timely not just because foreign affairs, but what is decisive from the aspect of the nation, it is not justified from the point of public law. Whatever amount of money of the Zsigray, Zichy... Palavicsini clique of earls lies with the Habsburgs, whatever he tries, he will fail. Since the Werbőczy concept, and that is what they forget, does not put weight on the king. In favor of the constitution of the orders it contents himself with the saint crown being the property of the nobility, which remains a crown even if there is no king, and... ... what is this? Come on let's catch that son of a bitch! What is happening here? It's the first of August, the twentieth anniversary of the start of the world war and the communists are organising an anti-war protest. Tell me my dear friend, on what basis is this anti-war propaganda founded on, with such an advert? Don't you sense what an illusion this all is? Soviet Russia has an excellently organised army, on which they spend a large percentage of its overall income. Even children in the kindergarden know, that every contemporary militarism arms itself with world peace. Well I don't mind, let them guard peace, but not so transparently... It's rare luck to spend with such an exceptional person, even just an hour. A person, who has such a high-handed knowledge about the world who can move so easily amongst the most radically different opinions and thoughts and who lies no more than most people. Well, at least only as much more, as much more he speaks. His opinion though, in each case... The reason is politics mylord. Workers are killed because of politics. Because of politics mylord. Hello? This is professor Vavra speaking, good evening. Tell me my young friend, were you aware that your cousin has been released? -Elemer? -You don't have to mention names. Would you bring us together for a meeting my dear friend? He has a phone if I may say so, his number is in the phone book. I know, but between the two of us, I'm suspecting that his phone might be bugged. You do understand, right? However you are not risking anything, since you are his cousin. Will you do it for me? 7 of clubs. 2 of diamonds. 2 of spades. 3 of diamonds. 4 of spades. Pass. He's arrived. Good evening ladies and gentlemen! -Good evening. -May I have a word, comrade Parcel-Nagy? -What may I bring you? -A capuciner, dark. -Well, when did you come out of jail? -It's been a week now. -It was wonderful comrade Vavra. -Wonderful? Oh, you mean the experience? Tell me, did you confess to the police that you received money from me? -Yes. -Why? -I have been mislead. It's not my fault comrade Vavra. I didn't confess out of cowardness. And they didn't get anything else out of me neither. Even though I have been questioned through a whole night. Three detectives tried. You can imagine comrade Vavra that they weren't picky about their methods. They beat me, hit me... He introduced a new time system. He only speaks in terms of before and after being busted. -Like christians speak about before and after Christ. -New Messiah, new time system. Why didn't you play your trump? You should have played it a long time ago! -Finally... Hi Evi! -Hello! -What is it, what happened to you? What took you so long? - I had to take care of something. -Hello Elemer! -Hello! Where have you been? -I will tell you later. And? Wouldn't you continue my friend? And then he asked me whether I know what value theory is. And that Karl said that me, who is from such a good family, etc. the usual, and then he casually asked Look sonnie, you also get your money from Prof. Vavra right? You can tell me. Since he's escaped to Russia a week ago. -And you naturally confessed.-Don't you understand comrade Vavra that I was deceived? He told me so cunningly, so convincingly, that you couldn't realise. -He mislead me, he tricked me! -He deceived you, of course. Maybe I should even feel sorry for you? You didn't confess on anyone else, except me. Excellent! Excuse me, how is it possible that you are still free? We will talk about this at another time my young friend. National socialism does not only not answer a bunch of fundamental questions, but does not even try to formulate them! However, fascism knows exactly what it wants and it wants it unequivocally, without any complications and that is war. It's worth thinking about why sympathy is rapidly growing towards it. The race concept opens such political perspectives... Don't you read a little too much? You had the chance to learn at the police station that too much speech is harmful, isn't that right? You don't have to answer. If you allow me a question Mr. Vavra, how do you make a living now? -From work. -What work? -Why are you interested? -You don't have to answer. Are you the same Vavra, who writes articles about economics in the Magyar Hirlap? Yes, I am the same one. Are you currently member of a party? -Of course. -Which one? -Why are you so interested? Are you the same Vavra that's having an affair with the wife of Karoly Parcel-Nagy? -Why are you interrogating me? -You know us. We don't know you. -Your friend knows me. -I don't think so. -If you sit down for a conversation with someone, do you have to know who they're having an affair with? -Not always. -In most cases however, it is typical of the person. -Not so much later, Evi started having an affair with Lorinc. Their love happened very sudden, but didn't last long. Their love was ended by an unexpected event. Half a year later, Evi was captured in Germany during her illegal work She was taken to court, sentenced to death, and executed. In general, I don't care. In your case however, I'm only asking in order to identify you. In order to clear your doubts, I'm the Vavra that is having an affair with the wife of Karoly Parcel-Nagy, this young gentleman's mother. Is there anything else? -Why are you trying to be friends with us? -Out of selfless sympathy. -That's completely in vain. I think you are overestimating the perspectives of communism. I don't think it's worth it for you. Don't cover yourself with us, it's not going to pay off. Don't be too hard on them my dear friend, these young people are mostly unreliable, superficial, most of them are outright stupid. There is only something charming about them, the idealism of youth! -Every word of them is a lie. Their behaviour is full of poses. -Lies... Lie is a dream caught red-handed my young friend. That's not the problem my dear friend, they're missing what you possess; the cunningness, the discretion and a sense of proportion -You cannot be only noble or only evil throughout your life my dear friend, you cannot do everything the same way... I admire you sir. Your endless life force. Your acting skills with which you cover your lack of character. That your personality does not have a single point, on which one can build for at least as long as one finishes a sentence. -But my dear friend... -Please refrain yourself from your untruthful friendly gestures. This is what I think about you. You are a traitor, impostor, multiple renegade, blackmailer, usurer, courtier and thief all in one person. I'm sorry, I hope I didn't offend you. Hello Lorinc, where's your coat? -Good day. -Goodbye. -Who was that? -My student. -Student? You have a student? -Please come in. -May I offer you one? -Thank you. -How may I help you? -I came to personally let you know, we are engaged with Desiree. -Congratulations. -Thanks. The engagement party is Monday evening, you are welcome. -I unfortunately cannot go. I will excuse myself in a telegram. -Have a seat Miss. How may I help you? -Do you live here alone? -I do. -May I offer you one? -Thank you, but I don't smoke. -How many rooms do you have? -Two. -How much do you pay for this flat? -Annual 1350 pengos, and 20 percent for central heating. -20 percent, that's 270 and one thousand..How much did you say it was? -13.. -Don't help me. That's 1620 pengos. -What's your monthly income that you receive without working? -May I ask you miss to what do I owe the pleasure? -I have several things to ask. I assume that you are aware of the circumstances of your father's suicide. -I do not wish to speak about this matter. -I do not think that you can prevent me from talking about something I want to talk about. Except if you throw me out. However due to your well-known courteousness, this is obviously not going to happen. This suicide. And the large number of misuses that he discovered gave a pretense to the unprofitable trust in order to stop operation of the plant. A natural cause of this was the workers ever-increasing excitement, that had to be intensified to such a degree, that the working class the trust however hired back only 4000 from the 7000 workers that have been fired. If you are by any chance interested, I am going to have a solo dance performance at the Music Academy's small room. This is a really pleasant flat. May I ask you miss, what does this all mean with regards to myself? This planned provocation of the workers has been organized by your friend, professor Vavra. -I have evidence that his agents were working at Csepel. -Mr. Vavra is not my friend miss. -You most likely noticed its signs at our last encounter. -You organized the meeting between him and Elemer. -I hope you don't wish to deny that. -Elemer has known him prior to that. I didn't introduce them to each other. -I mention for the sake of completeness, until yesterday, I didn't know that Elemer also received money for the party from Vavra. -I ceased all contact yesterday with Elemer, I will take him to court. That of course is none of your business. How did you dare accost me on the street? -So you're saying that you're not in contact with Vavra. -I'm not. -Not even through your mother? -Not even through my mother. -Then why do you meet with him in coffee houses? On the first of August you were seen together in the Club cafe. You watched from the window how the police beats the workers with their blades.. -You were amongst them? -That's not the point. I have to go shortly, so let me come to the point. Several hundred workers, provocated by your friends at the Csepel riots have been arrested. Most of them are still under arrest. Their families are being helped by the Red Benefit, an organization of the international proletariat. As the Hungarian group has little money, I ask you of a 2000 pengo contribution. Why do you ask me miss? These workers have been arrested so that your honorable name remain impeccable. It seems that you are one of those young gentlemen, that try to compensate their social position by an increased sense of responsibility. You can redeem your bad conscience with only 2000 pengos. You are behaving in such a way miss, as if you wished to make it impossible for me to give you money. -Maybe. So you won't give money. To my deepest regrets, I cannot help you. It's a pity. I'm sorry Parcel-Nagy. Look my dear son, your mother has been living so far in good conditions, we cannot ask her in this age to live in misery. Especially when she has a youthful healthy son, who can himself earn money. With Desiree, there's both of them. With Jackie's income they have altogether 900 pengos. They can hardly make a living. I unfortunately cannot help your mother out, and if I'm not mistaken, neither can your aunt Irma. Of course, maybe the situation will change from one day to the next. You know what he means. If the old hag croaks. Please Elza, I don't understand these rude insinuations. -However that's what he meant. It's useless to make excuses, he could have only meant that. That, of course that. Only heritage can help this family. Our proposition my son is that you give up the 400 pengos that you are entitled for your mothers behalf. Interrupt temporarily your studies and start working on the 400 pengo salary job that will be created for you at the trust. It's a wonderful flat. Could you lodge someone here for a couple of weeks, who cannot have his address reported? It's a pity. I'm sorry Mr. Parcel-Nagy. -Good evening miss. Please accept my congratulations, I really liked it. -Thank you. -If you don't mind, I would like to invite you out for dinner, if you don't have anything else to do. I would like to speak with you. Thank you Mr Parcel. Although I don't have anything else to do, but I rarely accept invitations. From higher class citizens, never. Out of principle. Good evening. Excuse me Miss... I am often mistrustful about human judgment. I think it is only righteous if it is humble. But prejudice cannot be that. In life in my opinion, decent behaviour is only possible if our sympathies or antipathies are not subject to our prejudices. It seems that the little gray book on your table is just a decoration. -You cannot have thought about it too much. -I have known you longer than you think miss. I'm sorry that we cannot speak. Good evening. Mr. Parcen-Nagy... I think... I think I have to accept your invitation. -You really didn't talk about Mrs. Rozsa to anyone? -I didn't. -Are you sure? -Yes. I didn't talk about her, believe me. -I'm sorry for being late. I couldn't get away earlier. -I'll get used to it. It's only midnight. Did you have dinner? -I didn't have time. -Don't even think about ordering something. I won't eat it. What do you think about me, how dare you? -I just wanted to make you happy. -That's how you make happy a chick from Lipotvaros, who likes being stuffed with presents. Look, I'm sorry. You'll take those packages tomorrow and never even think about sending me anything again. -Were you standing in this booth? -In this one. It's crazy. Each time I step outside that gate I look at this booth. Oh how hungry I was. I have been running around all day, I had so little time, I just realised how hungry I am. That was a miracle. I found some milk in the kitchen, I used that. You know we had a maid, a girl who always did it like that. -With milk? -Huh? How could I bring you here? How dare you accost me on the street? How dare you call for me? Did you want to scare me, blackmail me, what did you want? Why are you so suspicious? I didn't have any other reason, believe me. I just didn't want you to leave. I liked you. I wanted to hate you. I wanted you to hate me as well. Where did I make a mistake? Your job is to start a register of the personnel Mr. Parcen Nagy. 4000 workers and 600 employees. The data has to be partly collected from the Head of Engineers and the Work Directors. The production could increase by ten percent, if you get rid of the turbulent elements. Of course we're not talking about those who in January tried to smash skulls with a hammer. I took care of those a while ago. But you surely know that there are numerous people here who deserve attention. -You understand me, right? -I do Mr. Director. -Do you have any fortune interests at the trust? Do you have shares, or do you receive anything after your father? Or do you receive anything from your mother's pension? Karoly put one million franks in deposit for the sake of Laura, Lorinc and Desiree. And how did you meet him? Your student? -No. -Your friend? -Yes. -So he's a nice boy. -He is. The criteria is political reliability and working performance. The money was deposited in a bank in Basel. Dubrovnik was only an excuse. I don't understand you. Why can't you find yourself some nice prole who gives you a greater moral support. Eva! Come on! Comrade Parcen! -Come on! -I hope that you will do your job most conscientiously Mr. Parcen! I hope that we understand each other. What did you want? Did you want to betray me? Blackmail me? What did you want? Depora is the name of my darling... (singing) -Mr. Lorinc, may I take out the keys from your trouser pockets? In England, recently it was still unpolite to say the word "trouser". What would Queen Victoria say about my blouse? (singing) Don't worry, I'll lock it. I just don't understand why you keep staring at that bag. -Since when do you smoke? -I took up the habit. - When? -Now. I decided that now's the time. -You know what else I like about you? That you get undressed in the bathroom, and you come to me like that, naked. There's no sweeter sight than when someone, getting ready to make love starts folding a pair of trousers and carefully puts it on a chair. That would drive everyone crazy. -You're not suspicious anymore? -No. I think I know you by now. I'm sorry, Lorinc Parcen-Nagy? Please, someone's looking for you on the phone, second booth. -Hello! -Hello Lorinc, it's me. - Evi,is that you? -I'm sorry Lorinc, I cannot go there. -It's alright, I'll wait for you in front of the house. -No, don't wait for me, I'm not going home. -I cannot speak now. -I don't understand. Evi, I hope there's nothing wrong? -Well, tomorrow then. -No, tomorrow's not good either, not this week. I will be there Sunday 9 pm. Sunday? But today it's Tuesday. Hello? Hello? Hello? Evi, where are you? Hello? -I'm here Lorinc. We have to put it down. -Evi what happened? -I can't speak now Lorinc. Don't wait for me until Sunday. I'll be there Sunday at 9. -Do you wish to speak to Mrs. Timmermann? -Yes, yes. How is she? It's a miracle she's alive. She's been dying for three days now. -Miklos is not responsible that I tried to kill myself. I admit I couldn't bring him back. He had a very bad life with me. I committed the mistake that I pestered him at the flat of his lover. He sent me out five times. And I always went back. I couldn't leave him. The last time I went back, when he opened that door which I hated as nothing else by that time, so that I never have to step out of it again, and so that I can never go back, I rather jumped out the window. It's not his fault... Not his fault... Lorinc! Lorinc! -Bidet dear, bidet! -Oh, of course, bidet! Stop it please! Stop it! -Hello Lorinc! -Where were you all week? -May I drink from your cognac? -Where were you all week long? Don't interrogate me Lorinc. I can't tell you. -I'm leaving Lorinc. My train leaves early morning. -Where? -To Germany. Let's leave, alright? -For how long are they sending you? -I don't know, for a long time. I got an assignment, I don't know how long it will last. -Don't go Evi, cancel it! -Stop joking Lorinc, you don't mean it seriously.. -If I didn't know you, it would be easy. You're the reason why it's difficult. -Can I come with you? -No. -How did you call after me? Call after me! -Miss! Why do you let me do nonsense Lorinc? The only chance for fair behavior is if we don't insist on subordinating our sympathy or antipathy to our prejudices. -Calm down darling. -Stupid! Eva! -You silly. We'll manage without each other! singing... Where are you going? To undress? Why do you always have to undress in the bathroom you spinster? Sir Parcen-Kis Lorinc. I love you. I love you. What else can I say? Please keep me in your good memories. Good afternoon, you're a buffoon. Excuse me, sorry, my train is leaving. To Vienna, third class seat please. Evi! Don't pull such a sad face, rather from now on live a more reputable life, do you hear me? Or else I promise I will never come back! You think that you're alone in this world and that this is a grown-up way of living? -What happened? -Fischer! Go back to your jobs! Back to your places! The work cannot stop! -Come on! Are you alright Mr Parcen? Come to my office, sit down! -Thank you. Poor Fischer... For the ten years I've spent here he was never a minute late, and was always humble and respectful. One feels sorry for him... -You feel sorry for him? You don't say... -I don't say? What do you mean by that? -You don't have the right for condolences, engineer. You don't deduct the consequences. Otherwise it's just useless sentimentality, that I despise. -Do you understand? -I don't have the right? What the hell! I am astounded that you are surprised by this. Obviously the plant has no responsibility in the case. The worker caused the accident by his own fault. Unwise improvidence, for which as it is known, there is no material or moral gratification by law. -We could just as well consider it as a suicide. Am I right engineer? -You allow yourself astonishing things, Mr. Parcen! What was the worker's name? Jozsef Fischer? If you allow me, then in the name of the previously mentioned sentimentality, I give you 20 pengos, that you will please hand over to Fischer's family. -Engineer! Would you please send me in the afternoon the production reports! -They're not ready yet! -Mr. Engineer! Engineer! Would you please wait Mr. Engineer. Director Kerepesi has asked for them twice already Mr. Engineer. -May I tell him that you are not ready yet with the reports? -Tell the director, that I am an engineer and not a sneak! I signed on for engineering work with the Martin furnaces and not for office work, do you understand? I'm not willing to stick my nose in the personal matters of the workers; whoever has the taste for it, is welcome to do so! -Excuse me! -I would be much obliged if you told the director that personally. -Alright! -You know young man, the truth is such a serious matter that people like me shouldn't talk about it. I have a small house at Angyalfold, and behind it there is a shabby pantry. Now in this pantry the area's easy girls sometimes meet with some gentlemen. And if they wish, they sometimes leave a couple of fillers in the ashtray. For usage. It sometimes happens, that some of these gentlemen lose their watch chain, and then this gentleman writes an anonymous letter to the police chief. And what do you suppose the police chief says? The police chief says that Miss Hupka is an old procuress. And then if the police chief says so, then all the police officers say so, and whether Miss Hupka has stolen jewelry or not, the police chief is right. What do you think about that? What's your opinion young man? You're right, so right. You're too young to have an opinion about truth. But the problem is that even I'm too young for that, young man. We are all too young for that, young man. Tell me please, that kid, that Peter. Did he give you back then the 2 pengos? -Of course sir. Right the following month. As he promised. -And? What's he doing now? -Does his mother have a job? -She's at Csepel again. -At Csepel? -For about two weeks now. But that woman is a curse. She gets a job, one week later she's fired, or apprehended by the police. That's the best joke I've ever heard. That's the best joke. I want to know whether it's true that he embezzled. Is it true? Everyone says so... We knew who his father was, but it wasn't polite to talk about it. Isn't that so Lorinc, darling? Would you please tell us what he wrote in his farewell letter? You don't have the right to hide it from us! -First let that whore give me the letter my dear. -Csepi dear, go ahead! He stole the happiness of my life, highly respected court. -Go ahead, bravely! -The happiness of my life! -I withdraw my statement! Lock him up please. I wanted to take my revenge on him. -Her statement was false Mr. Judge! Lock her up. -I told you that I'm innocent. -Against all likelihoods I'm innocent. -Believe me or not, I'm innocent. Did you bring the Karoly's letter, whore? I don't feel anymore the beat of life behind the numbers, as before. And the fate of the 8000 workers I admit, concerns me as much as the fate of our large family, whose nauseating untrue familial love, I endured harder and harder as time went on. -What do you want from me? How can I help you? Why did you come here? -Do you have a problem my dear son? -You're talking to your mother rather strangely. What's the problem my son? -It's useless, please, don't touch me. -I talk to you in a tone that you deserve. I don't even remember when you visited here last. -To what do I owe the pleasure? -Lorinc! My son! Come here to your mother! -Get away from me, get away! I don't want this comedy anymore! -You ruined my life. -I ruined your life? With what did I ruin your life, my son. You always did whatever you wanted. Why do you open that window on me, it's cold out there! You should be ashamed of yourself. -Even your father behaved correctly with me. He didn't allow himself such... -Please, go home. Right away. Lorinc... -My son... -I don't intend to keep contact with the rest of the family either. Please tell them that. -Lorinc! -Please, leave. -Yes, please! Good afternoon! I'm Mrs. Fischer. -How can I help you? -I would like to thank you for the 20 pengos that you sent us. -You are mistaken, I didn't send you money.-No? But Mr. Bartok, the engineer said so. -Either he was wrong, or you misheard my name. -Due to my position, I feel it is my responsibility to let you know that there are politically unreliable elements amongst the workers. -For example? -I marked them on their papers. -Do you have a lot of these marked papers? -Just about 4000. -You are in a funny mood Mr. Parcen-Nagy. The full plant's workforce counts just more than 4000 people. -Not counting the overseers and the people in confidence, that number is exactly 3976 Mr. director. Please acknowledge my immediate resignation. During the resignation period I do not claim my salary. Thank you for your trust. singing Shut up! -Who are you looking for? -The Rozsa family. -First floor. There, in the corner! singing -Good afternoon.-What do you want? -My name is Parcen-Nagy Lorinc.-What do you want? -You have a son called Peter, whom I met a year ago by accident.-What do you want from him? -Nothing special. I would like to hire him. -How do you know him? -I met him in the pub in Csaki street. He was talking to your brother in law, he wanted to sell papers, he needed money. -I offered him the money, but he didn't accept. -Why do you blush always? I don't understand a word. Peter doesn't talk to bourgeois. How much did you want to give him? -Please allow me to take a seat, so that we can speak more calmly. -Do as you wish. -So how much did you want to give him?-50 pengos. -And what did he say, why didn't he accept it? -I don't remember. That is... I do remember. He said he doesn't accept money from the bourgeois.-Of course your remember. -And this touched you so much that now you wish to hire him? -In fact, I would like to adopt him. I live completely alone. I ceased all contact with my family, I don't have any friends, -I thought that we would understand each other very well with your son. -I know this gentleman Mrs. Rozsa. He's in Csepel, in the office. When my husband had the accident, he sent us 20 pengos. 20 pengos... How dare you dishonour other people! Get out of here! -Yesterday, when I went there, he denied it! He denied it to avoid speaking with me! - He denied it? -Listen. You're in the wrong place. I'm 45 years old and I've never eaten such a lunch that you eat every day. Peter, whom you want to adopt has never had enough to eat in his lifetime. His father was arrested and is going to be sentenced for 10 years. There is not a single week without a detective turning up. I can't go on a main street or use a telephone, or else I will be taken in and my children will starve to death. -You want to be charitable with such people? Go to hell! -Please, I will wait until you calm down. It's not important that Peter's father is arrested, but if he gets out, he will start again, and he will be arrested again. And detectives may come here, and even I will start again, until I'm beaten to death! And now you want me to give you Peter, so that you can raise him as an enemy and help you beat me to death! -Get out of here! And don't dare come here ever again, or I will beat your head to pieces with a coal shovel! -Come in! -Good evening! -I thought you would come again. -What do you want? -Couldn't we light a lamp? -We couldn't, since the power has been cut off. There's a chair, sit down. -Didn't I tell you never to come here again? -I would like to clarify something. -Do you hate the bourgeois people individually? -None of your business.-Please, answer me. If you sacrificed your entire life to the proletariat, you could really spare me half an hour. -After all, I am a person as well, you don't have to insult me without a reason. -I don't give a damn whether I'm insulting you or not. -Please, answer my question. What's the point of these questions? You are more educated and more intelligent than I am, you must know better. -You really think that I am more intelligent than you are?-Shut up! I can only think slowly. You always confuse me by interrupting. That's the trouble with proles, that they are closed in a prison of cleverness and intelligence. The prole doesn't hate the exploiter, he just defends himself as he would against cold or hunger clever and intelligent, it's easy to have power on us. And it doesn't change a thing that there are good people amongst you. -It's me. -Is that you kesztyus, come in. -As if I was ashamed of myself. -Who's here with you? -Come on, sit down here next to me, and stay silent. Marx said that you don't have to hate capitalists individually however Marx wasn't a proletar. He didn't know what it is like having to defend yourself constantly. The prole, who is satisfied by saying that it's not his fault, but it's due to the circumstances that he didn't become a man, that prole will not hate you. The one who writes books, even if he was a prole before won't hate you, because in fact that's not a real prole.

Your excellence. You lousy piece of shit! Son of a bitch! Please, I... Hey! Hey you! This one's most likely dead drunk. Hey! On this corner, very year they kill a couple of folks. Well, well..

Some acquaintance of yours? -Next to the Danube. -What? Danube? -Yes, I was walking there. -Leave me, thank you. I'll go home by myself. -Don't go, you might still be ill. -No, I'm alright.
