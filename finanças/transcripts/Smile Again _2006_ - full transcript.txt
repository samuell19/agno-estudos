Episode 9 The one I love most, my father. I love you. I love you. I'm sorry, father. Oh Dan Hee's mood today is really good. So I didn't stop her. I understand. Bring her in quick! I'll bring a glass of water. Pretty isn't she? She looks like me. Her eyes, nose, lips and even her heart. But she has never come back home so drunk like this. She's like me, she won't get drunk even after drinking a lot. Of course, that doesn?t include the times when she?s feeling upset. Actually these last few days, Dan Hee has been having headaches because of you. Please don't let Dan Hee be hurt because of you. If it's like that, I won't let you go. Yes. But, it might not be because of me. What's this? Isn't this taken in Switzerland? Who's Oh Dan Hee? I told you before right? There's someone who's like you. What does she do? She's a softball player. She's hurt today because of me. Who? Oh Dan Hee. Don't worry. People like you who grew up in a good environment might not know, but people like us who grow up getting blown by the strong wind, getting hurt like that is not such a big problem. Didn't you say you don't know her? Someone who lives in a greenhouse like me. Can I ever possibly play in a baseball team? Look at me. I'm definitely stronger than you. But it's better for you to give up. What? treating her nicely. I think wild grass should play with wild grass and flowers should play with flowers. If wild grass wants to play with a flower, it'll be very tiring. She's not a wild grass. Then what is she? If she's with you, she'll be like a wild grass. What are you doing there? You didn't even turn on the lights. You're so late. Looks like you have long working hours. Oh. Of course. I'm sorry. I couldn't get out just now. You want to have a drink? It's okay. I don't want things to get more complicated. What's wrong with you? Your expression is like that. You didn't see things that you shouldn't see right? I saw what I shouldn't have seen. What? What's our relationship? Are we friends? Now that I think again, I seem to know nothing about you. Aside from your name, Ban Ha Jin. Except for the fact that you saved my life, I know nothing about you. Yah. Isn't it enough to know my name and age to be friends? What else do you need to know? And I don't have a normal past like you. I don't want to tell you such past. It's dirty. I only want to keep the memories of my past to myself. I don't want to know either. Why are you suddenly interested in stuffs like that. I really want to ask you. If there's a reason, looks like you are going to tell me right? It's okay. Just go to sleep. Dad made some soup. Our Oh Dan Hee. How does it feel to taste a long-awaited victory? Good. My mood is much better. It would've been good if you came. I hit the ball so well. Everybody was shocked. That's why you drank like that? Do you know that last night that bastard carried you home? Who? Who else can it be? He's the only guy you meet. I was real drunk last night right? Yes. It wasn't a pretty sight right? He must've had complained a lot. Why? You don't want him to see you in a bad state? It's not that. Oh, dad. Kimchi. Eat kimchi. Wah. It's looks so good. Oh it's me. Where are you? I'm going to the company now. Really? Ah. Too bad I'm outside now. Then it can't be helped. I really want to see you. Yah. Oh Dan Hee calls me so early in the morning saying that she misses me. I feel that I have not lived for nothing. Oh are you alright? What kind of girl are you. Drinking so much until you became like that. Why didn't you cover for me? Dad got angry at me. How could I not cover for you? I don't remember a thing. How could I be like that in such a good day. Maybe it's because you were too happy. Don't worry. It wasn't that unpleasant that I'm not going to ever see you again. That's good. Then continue doing your work. I'm going off. Yah. Yah. Is that all? What? Shouldn't you say stuff like you want to hear my voice, you miss me or you want to meet me? At least you should thank me for taking care of you that day. Thank You. Ah. That's really Oh Dan Hee. You don't give people any chance to feel at ease. Ok. I'm going back. What's wrong? Ah this boy. What are you looking at? Are you crazy? No..no..no.. Eat quick! Didn't I say it clearly? That you shouldn't even walk around nearby the company. I know. Today I just came after finishing my work. Ah this boy. I miss you. Whatever. But in the future don't ever appear nearby here anymore. Ok? Someone who has committed a sin. How can you appear around here in broad daylight? I know. Ha Jin. Haven't you heard anything from Yoo Kang? what? nothing, nothing. You are really crazy. Stop the car. Let's go. Nice to meet you. I'm the team leader of this section, Yoon Jae Myung. I don't know how I should face you. Actually I'm quite surprised. That's a normal reaction. This is out first time meeting again after we met in Switzerland right? Have you heard any news about Ha Jin? How he's living now and all. I don't take interest in my ex-boyfriend. Of course, since we are both in Korea, it's impossible for me not to hear anything about his situation. Then, do you know where Ha Jin lives now? hm...if it's not me, he's just leaning on other people. Where does Ha Jin live now? You don't have to say it if you don't want to. What can I do even if I know? It's already over. This, this. Impossible! How can we come here so early in the morning to do this. My mood has been good until last night. How are you feeling? What? Weren't you half dead last night? You kept on drinking. Was I really drunk last night? It wasn't just as simple as getting drunk. coach, coach... Even if you are looking for him, but looking for a man in front of another man it's too much. How can you keep on giving us overtime? What overtime? It's still so early. The company said they would make them for it. You are cutting our training time! Shouldn't you be using your body? You can't go out to do publicity and you can?t manage anything, Now all you can do is just cut some training time. How can you say that? Be patient. If we continue on like this, they are going to make this an excuse to throw us out. Yes. Let's just do this now. We can practice later. You guys go and do your work quickly! If you keep on doing everything so slow, you are the ones who are going to suffer. How's everything? Can you still keep on doing sports? I heard the company is not giving their support. There's a little difficulty. It might even get disbanded. If it's like that, where are you going to go? Don't worry. I know we are not getting disbanded, but even if we are, I have a lot of places I can go to. really? That's good then. Lately, are you doing well with Ha Jin? He said he's going back to you and just abandoned me like that. When you meet him, can you ask him how he's doing? If I meet him. Let's just see. Be careful. A girl who's abandoned by the same guy twice, isn't attractive. What is it actually that you want to say to me? Don't beat around the bush and just get to the point clearly. I don't have that much time. I don't care if you know or not, Ha Jin is the only guy for me. Doesn't matter if it's the second time, third time, as long as he comes back to me, I'll accept him. but can you do that? Can you do that? Let's see. It's up to me whether or not I want to accept him. It's not something that I have to answer when someone questions me like this. And I'm also not yet in the stage where I should accept such a question. Why? Do you have another guy aside from Ha Jin? You can't answer. Looks like there's something. How's it? Choi Yoo Kang. Who did you make this perfume for? Then do you know what's the motto of Jean Paul? Isn't it the best smell coming out from best materials? There's something more important. Making perfume for your loved ones. I've made a lot of perfumes. But I think I'm not serious towards love. I hope all of you won't be like that. Only those who have hearts filled with love can make good perfumes. What's this? I'm sorry for not being able to answer your question just now. I was scared the others would have some misunderstandings. Actually that perfume, I made it for you. I've always wanted to make a perfume for you. Just like how you've made perfumes for your daughter, I also want to make perfumes, thinking about my mother. It didn't work though. But making one for you was much easier for me. Thank You. I've never thought of receiving such a present. Your lonely heart, missing your mom can get sympathy from a lot of people, but people might label me as a selfish woman. Saying how I left and abandoned her heartlessly, and now I came back looking for her. Maybe I'm just too greedy. * Kim Man Su * Yes. But the teacher can't answer the phone right now. Then please tell her my message. I need to contact her fast regarding news about her daughter. Yes. I'll tell her that. *add new contact* *are you sure you want to delete?* *deleted* * Kim Man Su * Are you Choi Yoo Kang? Yes. I'm Kim Man Su. I'm Choi Yoo Kang. Suddenly the teacher is not feeling well. So... I'm meeting you alone like this. I want to ask for a favor. That's why I requested to meet you. Yes. Please keep on looking for her daughter. But from now on, if you find any news regarding her daughter, can you please tell me first? Ahjumma, I'm looking for an address. This is my first time here. I'm looking for this Baek San bridge number 14. How do I get there? If you go along this road here up, you'll see an alley. And the first house there is the place. - Oh. I see. - Yes. Oh. What are you doing? Then what are you doing in front of someone else's house? Ah. You don't live here right? Yes. I do. Then, is there someone called Oh Jung Man here? Ah. You don't know right? But, why are you looking for that person? You don't have to know about that, I'm going now. Director. Manager Yoon Jae Myung is here. Let him in. How's the things that I asked you to take care of until today? There's not enough time... If there's time what are you going to do? You only know how to go after a girl and then? Get out now! What a lacking kid. Go call for Ban Ha Jin! And ask him to come to my office. You are worse than what I thought. I expected that you'll be a smart person. Don't be nervous. I didn't call you to come here for an interrogation. I'm just saying that since you did the work, you shouldn't forget the phrase " walls has ears." I don't know what you are talking about. I think now I have a fair condition to offer to you. How about it? Coffee? Yes. Don't drink too much coffee. People like us can get drunk from coffee. I know that too, but it?s the best way to get rid of tiredness. Your boyfriend. Who? Ha Jin? Yes. Please tell me how I can contact him. Ways to contact Ha Jin? If you want to say anything to him, I can say it to him. Then can you please ask him to come to my office now? Yes. I understand. If you saving our Jae Myung twice wasn't an accident, I can give you another chance. But it's not as a man, but as a way for me to save my son. Why are you so surprised? I'm just coming to see you because you didn't come to see me. You really have your ways to surprise people. You don't have to be nervous. I'm just coming to tell you something today. Somebody wants to meet you. Who? Teacher Sara Jung. Please come in. Have a seat. Why? Nothing, just... Just say it. You don't have to be polite. Maybe because you make perfumes, but the smell of perfumes all mixed up together is just so strong. You've seen it before too, my nose is like a dog's nose. Someone so sensitive towards smells, is really suitable to work in a perfume company. but for people who make perfumes like us, it's a rare ability. I'll just be straight forward. I wanted to meet you because I have a proposal. Proposal? I?m not sure if you?ve heard Yoo Kang mentioning it, but I?m a renowned person in the perfume industry. People like us usually do not mentor others, because I do not wish to pass on my skills so easily to anyone. But I like Ha Jin ssi?s talent. How about it? Do you want to be a perfumist? What? Well, it?s something I?ve never thought about. Then you should think through carefully. Opportunity like this does not come often. Don?t miss it. But, why did you pick me to say all this? If you want to groom a successor, there?s Yoo Kang. The talent that Yoo Kang and I lacked, I see it in you. Do you understand? Oh Dan Hee Yes. If you?re free, could we have tea? Okay. Please take a seat. Have you seen Ha Jin? I saw him once at the promotion but only from afar. That?s why I?m here to ask you for a favor. Favor... what is it? Actually, I would really like to see him. But he kept avoiding me when I call him. I heard that Ha Jin has got a new girlfriend. It may be due to this. Perhaps, you know who she is? I?m not sure. Yes. Come over here. Long time no see. What's going on? I?m the one who asked you here. How can you pretend not knowing that both of you are working in the same firm? Don?t blame Jae Myung ssi. I?ve asked him to call you because I wanted to see you. Is that so? Let?s order. Let?s drink. Should we make a trip to Gyeong Ju? I would like to visit the school, and the coffee house we used to visit. And also the bridge that we used to stroll by. Really? I heard you?ve started afresh with her. They said that once a relationship has been broken, it?s difficult to continue again. But looking at you two, it doesn?t seem to be true. Old saying can be wrong too. What about you? How are you lately? Didn?t you boast that you?ll find a man who?s better than me? Yes. Manager, are you in love? Oh, ah... not yet. Yoo Kang, you?ve become so childish. I?m childish all along. It?s just that you didn?t know that. Is this going to make any difference? We?ll have to see if there?s going to be any difference. What?s your reason for doing this? You still cannot accept it? I?ve already said that I?ve no intention of accepting it. I?ve been wanting to tell you. I heard something ridiculous. Why did you not tell Jae Myung about you and Oh Dan Hee. Control your balance. Hyun Su, use more strength. Hong Yeon Ah, twist your waist. Be serious. Be strong. Are you fooling around? More strength! Hey, who are you? It?s nothing. I heard you?ve started afresh with her. They said that once a relationship has been broken, it?s difficult to continue again. But looking at you two, it doesn?t seem to be true. What?s happened in the world? Avoid your destiny? If you hesitate, she?ll be snatched away by someone else. I?ve been wanting to tell you. I heard something ridiculous. Why did you not tell Jae Myung about you and Oh Dan Hee. You talk less now. Where has the talkative Oh Dan Hee disappeared to? All the players must be blaming me. That?s without a doubt. You've disappeared without any explanations. I was disappointed too. It?s as if I?ve seen another person. This change is due to many causes. Maybe I?m crazy. I understand. Why Sunbae has chosen this path. I?m starting to understand. But a disappointment is still a disappointment. You did not keep to your promise. There?s something I don?t understand. Why did Sunbae give up your dream? Do you lack so much faith in our team? I do not have faith in myself. Doubting others, doubting myself. That?s why you should confide in me during those times. Look what?ve happened now when you insisted on solving it yourself. *Ban Ha Jin* I missed you, Oh Dan Hee. Pick up the phone! What are you doing? I see that you?ve not settled it yet. So I?m doing it for you. I told you I love you. So you should just dump that fellow. The guy who had lied to you and played you, dump him now. Who?s lying to who? That?s what I?ve wanted to say to Sunbae. To be honest. I was confused. Did I hear wrongly? Don?t be troubled. Settle it soon. What? Don?t make a joke out of other?s heart. I?m not interested in that anymore. So... Ban Ha Jin means so much to you? Then I?ll just ask one question. When did you first meet that fellow? I?m asking you now. When did you start your sticky relationship with him? What does it have to do with you? What are you doing? Aye... really. How could the guy who left first came home later? What? Why did you drink so much? Let go! How long do we have to keep doing this? Until the company tells us that we don?t have to. That?s why I?m asking when they?ll tell us not to do this. I don?t know. When they feel good about it, I guess. Keep exploiting us. We?re just multi-purpose employees. What are multi-purpose employees? The kind that have to do this, that and everything else. It?s all because of that punk Jae Myung. After you blow in so much air, it will explode. It?s an order issued from some desk in the warehouse. Maybe it?s a ploy to get us to resign on our own. Do we have to continue putting up with this? Let?s go and look for the Chairman. If we?re to be dismissed, at least there?re some nice words for us. I?ll go. I?ll tell him clearly what we want and what we can do. Hello. I?m Oh Dan Hee from ?The Smell of Beautiful Smile? Sales Department. I?m also the pitcher for the softball team. I?ve been waiting here because I?ve got something to say to Chairman. Have you seen our team in a competition? Not yet? Do you know the names of all our players? We've won an invitation match against Chon Chen Group last week. Our wish is very simple. It?s not that we will completely not perform our tasks at the Sales Department. Can you keep to the promise that you will give us the afternoon off for training? It is important to paste the labels on the cosmetics, but training on the field is more effective for us. Chairman....Chairman. So, what do you want me to do, Ms Oh Dan Hee? Please reconsider as the competition is starting soon. We are running out of time for our training. That?s the problem of the Sales Department. But... Such an indiscreet girl. But she wasn?t entirely wrong. You did not uphold your promise to me either. You have to set an example before you can make a demand. I?m sorry. I?m so happy to see you. Are you crying? No. Seems like you are. I?ve already said I?m not. I?m sorry. The Sales Department needs to use this elevator. Please take the next one. I?m sorry. Why do people feel it?s so easy to take away other?s dream? - They?ve not done it, or experienced it. - Isn?t this world filled with thieves? It?s because you?re too innocent. Not everyone gets robbed like you. You give less and snatch more. It?s only fair. Is that fair? If not, those who have will continue to possess it, while those who don?t will have what little they have taken away. Is that fair? Oh Dan Hee. You hate the world, don?t you? A little today. Don?t hate the world. People who hate the world will become like me. I don?t want you to give a stinky acid smell like me. How can I like you then? And how can you like someone like me? That?s why I disliked the saying ?Birds of a feather flocked together?. I hoped that although we?re together, we'll each go on different paths. Wow! So beautiful! Didn?t I make your neck bare? So I?ve always wanted to give you something. Chairman, someone by the name of Che Kang Du has come to see you. Che Kang Du? Yes. He said that he?s from Gyeong Ju and you?ll know. What are you doing in Seoul? I?ve not seen brother for a long time. So I?ve wanted to see you for a chat. And also to visit this prospering company. You?ve expanded the company to such large scale. Aren?t you going overboard? If you did not come looking for me, nothing is overboard. Why did you say that? It makes one uneasy. I heard that you?ve opened a liquor company in Gyeong Ju? Thanks to brother. And you still come looking for me? Is that proper? Why are you still feeling so disturbed? That matter was in the past. You can now rest at ease, without any worries. But I?m still stressed when meeting you. It is so. Actually, I came because of my daughter, who ran away from home. And since I?m in Seoul, it?s only right to pay you a visit. Answer the phone. Answer the phone now, Ban Ha Jin. I?m leaving. Hey, wait. You need to take these. You can carry them by yourself? You have powerful arms, you?re a pitcher. Take care.
