- You asshole, Archie. That really hurt. What have you got in that bloody toy gun? - It's a normal cartridge. It shouldn't do that and it ain't no toy. It's made of stone. It's hollow, like an old drainpipe or a chimney. I wonder what's down there. - Probably just a sewer. Come and have a look at this, Archie. Well? - It's a trap door. - We going to open it? - Well, we've come this far. - Bloody hell, mate. I ain't going down there. Anyway, it's too dark. - As it happens, I brought a torch. - What'd you bring that for? - I thought it might be dark in the woods. - You're crazy. You're even more crazy if you're thinking of going down there. - Ah where's your sense of adventure? - You'd better take this then. Might be a bear down there. - Ha ha, very funny. Shit! - What you done? - Nothing. Just be careful of the bottom of the ladder when you come down. - I told you, I ain't coming down there. - It's a great big room full of stuff. Come and have a look. We better get out of here. - Anything? - Not much of any help at all in identifying him. He's garbled on about a friend and some sort of hideout in the woods but that's about all. - He looks a bit old for hide-and-seek games. Well, all we can do is something to turn up from missing persons. - Can you take over here for awhile? - Uh, why? - He's really agitated and mumbling about his friend so I thought I might take a look at the site of the accident just in case there's another boy injured or in need of help there. - Well, the place was still swarming with accident investigators questioning witnesses, measuring skid marks when I left. But if it makes you feel better, go ahead. - Thanks, Sarge. - The body of the female police officer was discovered in the early hours after a search after she failed to report back to her station. The police say suicide-- - Good morning. - Good morning, Linda. - Or revealed how the officer died. The police are also still trying to trace what they believe may be a missing teenage boy. - Oh, I hate that. - Bloody bastards. I bet they had something to do with that poor police girl being killed. - In the critical condition. - What you saying, Ethel? - As to whether the two incidents are connected. - That poor police girl what was killed, I bet they had something to with it. - We'll report more news when we have it. Now, here's Joan with the weather. - Sergeant Unwin, have they found anything? - No, sir. - And the undergrowth's making a ground search nigh on impossible. - Look, something's here, sir. - Well done, a spent shotgun cartridge. Probably used by someone shooting vermin and nothing whatsoever to do with the murder seeings as Bates was strangled with wire that was obviously so violent nearly severed her head clear off. So no, no gun was involved. Oh, sorry, Unwin, I understand you were the last officer to see her alive. - She was on my team. - Hmm, well seeing as you're being transferred to plain clothes detectives division tomorrow, you might be instrumental in finding her murderer. Who you working with? - Detective Inspector Huntley. - The new girl. Well, if you encounter any difficulties, pop by my office. Door's always open to colleagues. - I'll get forensics to take a look at the cartridge case, sir. - Yeah, you can do, but I think it's a waste of time. I'm calling off this search. We've moved too far from where the body was discovered. This is getting us nowhere. - Watch should be able to. - No, thank you. - What? No progress at all? Surely you must've been able to get somewhere. I've got a murdered policewoman and now a forensic officer who's apparently disappeared not to mention a missing youth and anther who's in a coma because of a traffic accident. What the hell is going on here? - I've got every single available officer back out combing the woods, but it's a massive area and it's the weekend. I can't keep the whole thing cordoned off. - Sorry to disturb you, ma'am, but there's been a development and I think Inspector Reed should take the call. - Put it through. He can take it here in my office. And what about this presumed missing friend? - You'd think the parents would've come forward by now. Think they'd notice their child's missing. - I think most parents have given up trying to keep track of their kids by the time they're teenagers, Huntley, but, uh, you wouldn't know anything about that, would you? Reed. Where? Okay. Search team have found another body. They're pretty certain it's the forensics officer. But it was found in undergrowth way over the other side of the forest from where WPC Bates was found. - Cause of death? - Likely to have been a stabbing. - That's right Detective Inspector, she was stabbed through the heart. Probably died instantly. Oh, and there was something else. - What's that? - The matter most certainly knew what he or she was doing. - Premeditated? - Possibly, but whoever did this was in control and very clever. - Professional hit not a crime of passion. - Well, he was certainly somebody with training. You see the knife wound entry was in exactly the right place to pierce the heart with the knife. But the knife remained in the body and was only removed after the remains were hidden. - Meaning? - Well, no trail of blood to indicate where the murder actually took place. Could've been anywhere in the woods really, but most certainly not where the victim was found. - Are you all right? - Yeah, I am. I was training her up to take over my job. You just make sure you get the bastard who did this and quick. - We'll do our best. Well, Detective Sergeant, find out anything that can help us catch the murderer? - Well, I reckon we gotta be dealing with a serial killer who's targeting policewomen. Could be someone must closer than we think, ma'am. - You can call me governor, boss, anything you like except ma'am. - And now over to our reporter Jeff Jacobs who is on the scene. Jeff, can you tell us any more about what appears to be a double murder of two female police officers? - Not very much I'm afraid. The police are giving out very little information at present, but they have said that they will make a statement to the media probably sometime this afternoon. - Jack, Jack. - Well that was Jeff Jacobs reporting on what appears to be the scene of an extremely violent - Do you want more tea? double murder in Shafton Forest near the village of Lower Pendlesham. - Oh, Jack! - What's wrong? Are you okay. - Losing his marbles if you ask me. - That's his latest school photo. Would you like me to look for some more? - No, this'll be fine for now. Is there any other information you can give us about where he could've gone? - We just don't know officer. - Okay, shall we start with when you first discovered he was missing? - When he didn't come down for breakfast yesterday morning. - And you didn't think to report him missing earlier? - He said he was going out with his friend Vince and that he might be late home so not to wait up. He's a teenager. These days they do their own thing. - And when Archie left, did he give any indication as to where he and Vince were going or if anyone else was involved? - I'm sorry, I've got to ask, is there any friction between you, an argument that could've caused him to run away? - Certainly not. - Archie is a good boy. He wouldn't harm a soul. - We'll see ourselves out. Call us immediately if you hear from Archie. - But we've already searched the forest. - I've got the police and crime commissioners breathing down my neck demanding answers so search it again. - Well, I'm guessing DI Huntley and her team have come up with nothing. - They're busy gathering relevant information. - Well, maybe her new sergeant can help you. - How do you mean? - Well, what I can gather he's the last officer to see both of the victims alive. - We'll never find it in there. - We best get Dad. - Dad, Dad, did you see the thing in the woods? - What you talking about? - It kicked our football back. - It was like funny man. - Well, you better go and take a look. You hear some strange stories these days. Nobody's safe. - There's nothing there. You're all exaggerating or dreaming. - Then how did our football come back out? - Sorry folks, you're gonna have to leave the area. We're bringing up a police cordon round the forest and there's about to be a major search here, so can you return to your car please? - Are you looking for the funny man? - Funny man? - Uh, I'm sorry, Officer, they thought they saw someone in the trees. They have a vivid imagination. - He kicked our football back. - He has a mouth there made of dust. - We're very sorry for the inconvenience, guys. - Not even allowed to go for a picnic in the park? Bloody Gestapo. - Thank you, sir. Wanna go take a look? Just in case the kids actually did see something. - We better check it out. - Come on. What do we have? - Yeah, a couple of kids claim they saw something in the woods so we're taking a look. Probably a wild goose chase but you never know, out. - Wasting our time, mate. - Yep. - There's nothing here. Kids were imagining things. - No, ja! - You need to see this. Intestines have been cut away and laid out like some sort of ritual murder. I think we may have a new Ripper on our hands. - Apart from the heat signatures of the odd deer and vermin there is definitely nothing alive down there. - Well, we interrupt our story to go live now to Lower Pendlesham where a police spokesman is about to give a press conference. - We have so far recovered four bodies from the woods all of them serving police officers from various spectrums of the force. - Here, this in the paper. - And all of them-- - They write must been a massacre in the woods. - Can you give us more details of these murder victims and how they were actually killed? - Hope they dump off some more of them foreign tourists. - Have you made or are close to making any arrests? - Ethel, I think you mean terrorists. - Is there any connection between the murders and the missing teenager? - I'm sorry, we're gonna have to leave it there as I can't reveal any more at this moment. This is an ongoing investigation. - Can you just confirm the rumor - Jack, are you all right? - that as the perpetrator seems able to slip through your net, this is not the work of a gang, but a trained lone hit man or insurgent who has local knowledge of Shafton Forest? - Any comments on that? - The reporter could be right. I reckon we're dealing with a loner type, an anarchist, hermit who thinks themselves a resistance fighter. - Maybe this guy isn't even living rough in the forest. Maybe he lives nearby with enough local knowledge to give us the slip. Might be somebody working on the land and living amongst the farming community. - I agree with that comment. It's gotta be someone with local knowledge. - Okay, here's the plan. We're gonna seal off all roads around Shafton Forest and question any motorists who go through regularly on if they've seen anything suspicious that could help us with our inquiries. At the same time, we're gonna visit all rural properties and ask the inhabitants along the same lines. DS Unwin will allocate you all your various assignments and please be careful. We're after a cop killer. - So he has no allergies that you're aware of or anything like that? Okay. We-- - Any new developments, Doctor? - He came round briefly earlier, but we're trying to keep him in a sedated state. - Did he say anything? - Nothing coherent or sensible. He sort of sat up in a panic and had to be restrained. Kept screaming something like, "Get it away from me," over and over again. - I've been showing these police officers our priest hole. - Yeah, very interesting. - They're here because of the goings on in the forest. Wondered if we'd seen or heard anything unusual or suspicious. - No. Sorry, can't help you. We've not seen or heard nothing. - I really think we ought to tell them especially how serious it is with these murders. - Tell us what? I have to warn you if you're in any way aiding or abetting a criminal in a case of this nature, the consequences for you will be very dire. - Have you been giving someone food or shelter? Or has anybody stolen an animal from you perhaps to kill and eat? - Oh no, nothing like that. - Fuel, large drum of petrol. - What about it? - Well, I'm allowed to keep diesel, petrol, oil for tractors and machines in proper tanks for safety. - And we keep a few drums at the back of the barn for our own use which is against regulations. - We're not gonna grass my mate up at the petrol station who supplies me. - So what are you saying? - One of the drums went missing last night. - Stolen? - Had to be. - Can you show us where it was taken from? - Aye. There and one's missing. - Unlikely to be connected to our main case. - Yeah, well, thanks very much for your assistance. We won't be reporting this, but you should stick to the rules in future. And please if you see anything else suspicious, let us know. - Of course. - What do you make of that? - Someone probably saw him unloading and decided to help themselves. Could be one of the neighbors. Let's check the next house. - Can I ask you to step from the vehicle please, sir? Take the cab in please. - What's the problem? - I'll only take a minute. Can I see it? Every day? Seen anything unusual? We should-- - Get down on the ground, get down. - The Home Secretary visited the scene this afternoon and had this to say. - I promise you that we will make sure that we bring the perpetrators of these cowardly and despicable attacks to face justice. - Home Secretary, can you tell us if it's known who was responsible? - I've just won at Bingo. - Get, get out of the way, Ethel, please. - There are several insurgent groups-- - Ethel, get out of the bloody way! - Oh, all right, all right. You're not still watching this rubbish. You'll get square eyes, you will, watching 24-hour news on the loop. Besides, I wanna see my soap, find out what's happening to the latest murder in the Chiplin. - No, no, no, no, don't change the channel! - No! - I've gotta watch this. Ethel, Ethel, Ethel. Get her away, get her away! - Give someone else a turn. - I've got a twist to that minister who was talking on the television. - Yeah Jack, listen, Ethel's right. You need to share the television. - No, no, no, no, you've got, you don't understand. I-I need to talk to the police. I-- - You've got to have him put away. He's getting violent. - Listen, listen. - Jack, Jack. - You're not taking this seriously. I've got to talk to the police. I've got to warn them because he's back, he's back. - All right, all right. And it's my fault. Oh God, it's my fault. - Okay, just... - So, not a sophisticated device. - Not at all. Basically, it's a large Molotov cocktail made by igniting a canister of fuel. - Obviously there's no clues to who made it. - Unless there's anything else, we need to get back to the farm, question the farmer again about the missing fuel. - The technology for this kind of device has been around for decades, at least since World War II. Insurgents, rebels, resistance fighters have been using this kind of incendiary type bomb for a century or more. - Basically anyone could've made it. - To be honest, there's probably instructions for it on the internet. Anyone with a grudge and bit of common sense could put this together. Teenage kids more than capable. - So maybe we should a bit of pressure on the doctors to get some more information out of that teenage kid in the hospital. - Let's get back to the farm. - I'll look after that for you then. Bit of old-fashioned police pressure might not go amiss. - Hello. Anybody there? - Mrs. Roberts. - Let me. And go. Leave me alone. - This is the police. Throw the gun out and come out with both hands fully visible. - Should I call for armed response units? - Okay. What's happened? - Don't let it get me. Help me. - Okay. - Please help me. - Okay, whatever it was it's gone now, you're safe. - You don't know. It might come back. - We're calling for backup. - Okay, I'll get on it. - No, no. - What is it that scared you so much? - It was, it was like a man. - Okay. - But he wasn't a man. He was a dead man. - Okay. - He was horrible, hideous. It was, it was floating, moving less. And it exposed both. And it didn't have a face, just a skull with eyes in deep sockets. Oh my God. - Okay, okay. Where's your husband. It's all right. Let's get you into the house. Come on. Come on, up. - Calvary's on its way. - It's okay. The husband. Come on. Come on, let's get you safe, come on, come on. It's okay. It's okay. We will. - Fuck! - See, there's nothing out here to be afraid of. - Oh, fuck! - Are you all right, then, huh? What's going on? Everything all right? - If you could just give me a few minutes with him and then put him back under. - The best chance for the boy is for us to keep him in a state of sedated unconsciousness and slowly bring him back. It's a tried and tested technique. - I understand that, Doctor, but this kid could save lives and there's been a lot of deaths already and anything he can tell me about what happened to him in the woods could prevent more deaths. - The risk to my patient of attempting to revive him too early or too quickly is too great. And anyway, how can you be sure he has any information that might be of use to you? I'm not prepared to change our medical procedure. - Well, this is a new one. What do you make of it? - You mean did she create a fantasy story to hide the fact she murdered her husband? - Well Unwin, you've gotta admit her story is a little bit farfetched. - Well, she was pretty distraught when we found her. - Well, she would be, wouldn't she according to her story. Well, let's just recap shall we? A zombie came out of the woods presumably to steal more petrol so it could make another bomb. Her husband disturbed it so it attacked him. She heard his screams so she ran out carrying their shotgun because she thought it would be a wild animal. She shoots the thing which doesn't stop it so then she thinks it's gonna attack her. So she cleverly runs away and hides in the barn which worked because it didn't find her. And then you two turn up. - Okay, it takes a bit of believing, but whatever it was, it certainly terrified her. - Come on, Huntley, you must've heard a few tall stories when someone's trying to cover up a murder even in your short time in the job. You don't think that it's too much of a coincidence that this creature buzzed off just as you two detectives turned up thereby stopping her from disposing of her murdered husband's body properly. - Have you seen the body, sir? - No. - No. - But I hear it's pretty horrific. - Yeah, his neck wasn't just broken. His head was almost torn off. - Yeah, and he was a big guy. I really don't think a woman like her could've done that. - Well, maybe she had an accomplice which is often the case in a murder. A boyfriend perhaps which is why they wanted rid of the old man in the first place. - Then why make up such an unbelievable story? Why not blame it on a wolf or a large cat or an escaped animal? Surely that's more plausible. - Oh, what, so you think that she really did see a zombie? - Maybe she saw a man in a skeletal mask, body armor, we don't know. - Thank you, Unwin, yeah, you mean like a budget Batman that's turned bad. Listen, I'm not buying any of it, okay? I want her under guard in the hospital until we work out whether she's committed an offense or not. Maybe then we can release her probably straight to a psychiatric hospital. - Have you forgotten that what we're dealing with appears to be a mass murderer cum terrorist who seems to be able to disappear into the woods without a trace? This is not an isolated domestic incident. - So you think that someone or something really did come back to get more petrol. - I'm not ruling it out. - Okay, and this person or thing, you think is foolish enough to actually try it again. - Possibly. - In that case, I think we should keep the whole place under guard. - I agree. - Good. Carry on. - Could be a potential trap for the murderer. - So what do you make of all this business? - What you mean? - Well, it's unlikely that whoever tried to steal the fuel is gonna come back for another go. Now, if we're meant to be some sort of trap, I think we're wasting our time. - Well, could be we're some sort of bait or something. - Not seriously trying to tell me you believe all that rubbish about a bloke in a gorilla suit, are you? - Ah, it might be a real gorilla loose in the woods that escaped from the zoo or something. - That's funny. Mind you I don't like the look of this fog that's developing. - Did you hear that? - Yes. Jesus. - You scared the shit out of us. - Sorry if we startled you boys. Just taking Kaiser for a sniff around. Looking for anything suspicious. - And why is it you dog squad people only ever use German Shepherds? - 'Cause they're the best for the job. What's up, boy? What's up? Kaiser! Come back, Kaiser! No! Kaiser, no! Oh. - What the fuck was that? - Someone call the air ambulance. - The dog just ran into the fog and attacked something. - Could you describe the assailant? - No, I mean we didn't get a clear look. - Yeah, we better get forensics down here again. Piece of material from an army uniform? - An old one. - What you thinking? - Military fanatic? Could be a deserter trained in guerrilla tactics. Should call the army. DI Huntley. Thank you, we're on our way. Let's go. - What's that? - The kid, Vince, he's conscious. - And talking? - Seems so. I am sorry to hear the boy died. - We were told he'd regained consciousness. - He came around, briefly. - Did he say anything when he came out of his coma? - Anything about his accident or what happened that might actually be of use to us? - Well, I'm not sure if this is of much help but he did mutter something although he was in a state of delirium. - What, what did he say? - Well, I can't be sure of the exact words but it seems that he and his missing friend were in the woods shooting rabbits with his friend's shotgun when they discovered a secret underground chamber filled with military equipment. Oh, there's something else. - What? - There was something in that underground chamber that obviously terrified the boy so much that it caused him to run and that's what led to the road accident. - Yeah, I'm sorry, honey, but you know how big this case is. There's just something about it doesn't add up. Yeah, I know I missed dinner last night as well but I can't just knock off, especially with the new boss as my partner. Don't be ridiculous. And no, I'm not even sure if she likes men if you know what I mean. Go, gotta go. Ah, so how'd it go in there? - Archie owned a shotgun. - Huh, so the boy Vince was probably telling the truth about everything else he said in his rambling. - Seems so. Any developments here? - Uh, army denies all knowledge of any soldiers AWOL or deserting. - Well, at least we have an idea of what we might be looking for now. - There was another thing which I thought was a bit too much for coincidence. - Go on. - One of the murder investigation team took a call earlier from an old geezer in a care home. He said it was essential he speak to someone in authority because he knew who was responsible for the attacks. - Why haven't we followed this up already? - Well, it seems that although the old guy managed to get to the phone, the people looking after him were adamant he'd gone senile. - Okay, so why are you telling me now if this is just some crazy old guy who watches too much TV. - Because in his call he mentioned about a so-called underground operational base in Shafton Forest. And he talked about it before the boy Vince got out with that information. So there's absolutely no way the old boy could've heard about it from anyone involved in the case. - Let's go talk to him. How far is it? - Few miles away. - Let's go then, Sergeant. Oh and by the way, I do like men. Just haven't met a real one yet. ♪ Wrap it up put it in ♪ Never take it out ♪ Wrap it up put it in ♪ Never take it out ♪ Wrap it up put it in ♪ Never take it out ♪ Your hands against my hips ♪ My lips against your lips ♪ You take me to a paradise ♪ My waterfalls are bliss ♪ And I can it rain all night ♪ 'Cause tonight - What was that? ♪ No rules apply ♪ I don't care who you been with ♪ - Oh my God. - Carl, what's wrong? ♪ So for the next three hours ♪ Nothing else matters ♪ We can make time stand still ♪ Stand still ♪ I wanna box this - You mustn't get Jack too excited or worked up. Must they, Jack? - We just wanna pick his brains a little bit. - Well, that should be easy. I haven't got much brains left to pick. - Can you tell us about these operational bases? - Yeah, OBs. In 1940, hundreds of these places were built underground and they remained operational until they were abandoned when the Auxiliaries were stood down in 1944. Now, most of the people never knew anything about 'em. And those who did know something about 'em well, most of 'em are dead now. - What were they built for, what were these Auxiliary units? - The OBs were our last line of defense. - Ah, so we're talking World War II. - Yep. After Dunkirk, remains of our little army came back and uh, we knew that Hitler was going to invade us any day. So Winston Churchill decided that he would create a resistance group made up of the most able and dedicated of the Home Guard. - Dad's Army. - That's right. - Old men and young boys willing to fight the invading Germans with pitchforks and blunderbusses. - It was like that in the beginning. But the Auxiliaries were something different. - And you were one of the Auxiliaries. - Yes, I was. And we were so secret that this is actually the very first time I've ever talked about it in all that time. - I think Jack's getting tired now. Maybe you could come back tomorrow. - I'm sorry, this is rather urgent. - No, no, no, it's all right, love, it's all right. Now listen, I think you better go make us a cup of tea because what I'm gonna say here now might contravene the Official Secrets Act and I don't want to get you into trouble. Well, not that way anyway. Now, where was I? Yes. Those of us who volunteered and were selected were taught how to kill the Germans in the most horrible ways. - So you were to fight on after the supposedly imminent invasion. - To the last man. They gave us the best weapons available. They gave us plenty of explosive. They taught us how to survive, how to improvise, and how to conduct guerrilla warfare. - Using the underground OBs as boltholes. - Yes. They gave us 14 days of rations 'cause that was just about as long as we were expected to survive after the balloon went up. - I'm sorry, balloon went up? - After the Germans invaded. - Except the RAF defeated the Germans in the air and without air cover, the Nazis would never adventure across the Channel from France. - You're right, the Battle of Britain. Course all this must sound like ancient history to you. - Thanks, Jack, this has been very helpful. - No, now wait, there's something else you gotta learn. - Don't upset yourself, Jack. You told us a lot. - The first task of the Auxiliaries was to eliminant anyone who knew anything about us, local policemen, town mayor, local dignitaries. - You mean murder your own people. - Yes. Anyone who might have any knowledge of our whereabouts and who could give it away under torture or interrogation was to be eliminated. Something went wrong. There was an accident. It's one of those things that happen in war. The signal for the invasion was to be the ringing of the church bells. They'd been silent since Dunkirk. I was walking home and the bells of the local church rang and I was the only person on duty. So I went straight to the OB. There was no one there expect Bob Pearce. Now, Bob Pearce was our commanding officer. He'd helped to set the whole thing up. I mean, he knew the whereabouts of every bunker in the area. So we opened our secret orders and the first on the list of the people to be killed was Bob Pearce. I shot him in the bunker. And then I climbed up to do the rest on the list. And it was only when I got outside that I realized that I couldn't hear the bells ringing anymore. There had been no invasion. It was just a couple of kids who broke into the bloody church to ring the bells for a lark. - It was an accident of war a long time ago. - I went back down into the OB, I smashed the radio, I sealed the hatch, and as the months passed, chances of invasion diminished, and then we were all called up. - What relevance do you think this has to our case? - I think Bob Pearce has come back to kill Nazis. No, no, no, I know it sounds ridiculous, but please listen to me. Bob swore to me once that no matter what, even if he was killed, he would find a way to come back and kill Germans. - So why kill police officers? - Oh, that's, that's easy. I mean, you think about the police officers in those days. All they had were those tall helmets. They were armed with a watch, a whistle, and a truncheon. Now, these days you're all wearing stab jackets, you're carrying automatic weapons, and you're all dressed in black. Have you ever seen pictures of the Waffen-SS? - Okay, so why now after what must be 75 years? - I think somebody found and opened the hatch. - It's gonna be okay, Jack. We know what we're looking for now in the forest. Thank you. - I, if you're going after Bob, you'll take me with you, won't you? - I'm not sure that's gonna be possible. - You'll never find it. That place was designed to be concealed from the enemy. I can take you exactly to the place. - Thank you, Jack. We'll let you know if we need you. - All right. Thank you. - Well, if we tell any of this to anyone on the force, they'll think we've lost our marbles. - Maybe not. - How so? - Well, from what the old boy told us, maybe we should be looking for a nut who is using this OB underground base. - DI Huntley. There's been another murder. - How lovely of you to join us. I should fill you in on what's happening, shall I? - I'd rather hear it from forensics, thank you. - A fairly straightforward crime, Detective Inspector. A young man in the front of a car with his throat cut and, again, probably died instantly. - And the shoe, tell them about the shoe. - I will get to that. Please don't try and tell me my job. - Shoe? - Well, we're convinced there was another occupant in the car, most probably a woman as we found a handbag in the passenger side foot well and a discarded shoe. - I'll send a couple of officers over to scour the woods to see if they can find another dead body. - Or missing person. - Do we have identities? - Well, we've got the man's details from the contents of his pocket. We haven't as yet opened the handbag as we're checking the blood spattered on the side of it, most probably from the murder vic. - Could the missing woman have carried out the murder? - Theoretically possible except for two factors. You see the victim was undoubtedly attacked from above and behind. If you take a look at the roof of the vehicle, somebody, and quite possibly the murderer, has gained access from outside after ripping a hole in the canvas hood. - That's a German car. - Uh, does that have any bearing whatsoever on this matter? - It might do. - Huntley, I've communicated to the Assistant Chief Commissioner and she has agreed with me that it's time to bring in the army so that we can do a thorough search of this forest so that we can catch this sicko, okay? Good. Carry on. - Looks like it's time for some more drastic measures. - I'm not being funny now. But we're not gonna scale up the operation now for one lunatic hiding in the forest. - I got up early this morning because I thought there was gonna be at least double this amount of men. What is this? - All right. Assistant Chief Commissioner Dale was expecting more men, sir. - I'm sorry I don't have the manpower to spare more troops for an operation of this nature. And Grant here is a very experienced officer at rooting out terrorist. All our men have been operationally trained for this type of mission. - Sir. - All right, boys, we're going into Shafton Forest. Obviously the ground that we're dealing with is thick and uneven woodland. Advance with caution. Situation enemy forces, we're dealing with one lone insurgent. He's responsible for a lot of casualties so he seems like he's gonna be trained. Situation friendly forces, we're gonna be joined by our friends in the police force. Hopefully they won't get in the way. Our mission, find, apprehend, or neutralize the insurgent. All right, boys? - Sir. - Happy? - Sir. - Let's go. - What on Earth? What exactly are you playing at, Detective Inspector, bringing this elderly gentleman here? - This is Jack. He's a member of the Auxiliary Group. He worked from an underground base here back in 1940. He's gonna show us where that base is and who's hiding there. - All right, look, this is ridiculous. What makes you think someone's gonna use a redundant old wartime base? What are the chances this guy can remember that far back? Forest doesn't even look the same. - How long were you based here? - Few months now, but I remember it like it was yesterday. - So why were you here? - When the German Army swept over this area, our job was to kill, delay, harass with all possible means. Our second function was to use our radios to inform what was left of the British Army of the situation. - Can you give me information about what somebody trying to emulate your resistance group might have done that we haven't released to the media? - Yes, ma'am, I think I can. It would surprise me if you have not come across some disemboweled bodies with their entrails decoratively spread. - What was the point of that? - To intimidate the enemy. There's nothing quite like seeing your mate's guts spread out like a plate of spaghetti for making you pause to think. - Anything's worth a try. - Thank you, ma'am. - You fit to talk? - But you're not gonna believe me. The military police spoke to me just now and they think I knocked my brains out. - That's okay. Most of our colleagues feel the same about us and we haven't been hit on the head. - Or choked half to death. But I know what I saw and I know what I felt and that thing was cold and dead. - Well, this is our friend Jack. He thinks he has some answers. He wants to ask you a few simple questions. - Okay. - Hello, darling. Now, this thing you saw, was it wearing a military uniform? - Wasn't paying much attention to what it was wearing. Even thinking about it makes me shudder and it happened so fast. But uh, maybe it did have or at least some remnants of Cargi, but it was decayed and like a body dug up and its eyes were just-- - Why do you think it stopped attacking you, let you go? - If this lump on my head is letting me go, then I don't know what you mean. But it did look at me and seemed surprised, curious, as if I was from another planet. It started to study my uniform. Uh, it was disgusting. It smelled putrid. - It's confused because she's black. - Excuse me. - Oh, no, no, no, no offense intended, darling. Now, I'm sorry, but look at it from his perspective, all right. I mean, he knows that the Nazis are the most racist people on the planet. You are clearly of Afro-Caribbean descent. There is no way that they would've allowed her in their army. He's confused. - Okay, this is all getting very weird. - Stormtroopers here, too. Here, tell that officer up ahead to slow down and keep his eyes peeled. - All right, we've thrown a police cordon round the entire forest. Now nothing can get out. We'll have the murdering bastard this time. - Listen, before you do anything, let me talk to Bob because I don't think you're gonna be able to stop him by physical means. - Do you really give any credence to this old man's fantasy? Because I think your career's pretty much blown if you do. - Jack, do you really believe that this Bob Pearce is carrying out these murders from beyond the grave? - Yes, ma'am, I do believe that. Bob Pearce was a patriot. He died for his country and I believe he thinks that the Germans have landed and are invading. And if I am right, you're gonna find a few surprises that he's set for us up ahead. - This man has confessed to murdering his superior officer. Shouldn't you be talking to the CPS about a prosecution instead of indulging him in this stupidity? - Excuse me. - With me, boys. This way. It's not far. - All right, take it slow. - Boys, keep left. Hold back. - Mother me. - She's alive! Get back! - Why? - God, no, get me down! Get me down! - Booby trap. Get down! - Grenades, take cover. - Oh, God! No, no! Get me down. - I don't know much about it, but I don't think you can delay a grenade that long before it explodes. - All right, everyone stay where you are. - Get me down! - They might be ancient and obviously pretty much dud but they're still dangerously volatile. Someone help this lady. - Oh, fuck her, get me down! - Go and get the bomb disposal team and medics. - Chief, ah! - And take your time. God knows what other booby traps are in these woods. - Ah, oh yeah. Oh, oh. - I don't think they're gonna get anything out of her for a couple of hours. Poor kid. - Shouldn't we wait for the others, sir? - No, waste of time. This is the area we should be searching. Clear evidence somebody's been living here. Quiet, quiet! And whoever it is is still around. You should've been more vigilant. You two, take this idiot back to the field hospital, get me another one, get back here as soon as possible. You two with me. - Oh! - Tell 'em to stop. - What's wrong? - We're here. - Captain. Halt your men. - What's the problem? - You see that rotting trunk there? - Yeah. - That is a chimney. Now, if I remember correctly, just over behind those bushes was the escape hatch. - Escape hatch. Meadows, go and check out that escape hatch. - Yeah, this is the place. - What do you mean this is the place? Jack, there's nothing here. - You're standing on top of it. - Yeah, there's something here. - Captain, I found it but the ground slipped and covered everything up. This is the only way out. - All right, how do we open it? - Oh right then. Only thing I ever nicked from the army was this. Now, now. Now, as I remember, the catch , the catch was over this way. Ah, there you are. Come on now, Bob. There are no Germans here. They're all British. There was no invasion. Those bells, ah, they were a mistake. The RAF beat the Germans in the sky and then Hitler bought London. He went and invaded Russia instead. And then all, all the decent people in the bloody world come to our side. The Empire, the Commonwealth, the Dominions, even the Yanks got in. Late as usual, but by God. Anyway, Bob, the only thing that remains now is something between you and me and let's do this man to man, face to face, the way we would back in 1940. Come on out now, old friend, please. Come on out. - Go! - No, it's all right, it's all right. It's Bob. It's Bob. Bob, I'm... I want you to know how sorry I am. Those bells, it wasn't the invasion. It was a couple of kids that broke into the church for a lark. And then you, you saw the orders for me to kill you and the others. Bob. I'm, I'm, I'm so sorry, mate. I'm truly sorry. I beg you, forgive me. - You all right? Jack. Just breathe. - All right, what's up? You okay, sir? - We need you back to a safe distance so we can get down there and sort this out. According to records, there's enough unstable TNT down there to blow up the whole of Shafton Forest. - I don't know how the hell you're gonna write this one up, gov.
