Do you know what it's like to fall on the floor? Cry your guts out till you… got no more? Hey, man, now you're really living. Have you ever made love to a beautiful girl? Made you feel like it's not such a bad world… Hey, man, now you're really living. Now you're really giving it everything. And you're really getting all you gave. Now you're really living What this life is all about. Well, I just saw the sun rise over the hill. Never used to give me much of a thrill. Hey! But hey, man, now I'm really living. Hey! Hey! Hey! Do you know what it's like to care too much Bout someone that you're never going to get to touch? Hey, man, now you're really living. Have you ever sat down on the fresh-cut grass Hey! And thought about the moment and when it will pass? Hey, man, now you're really living. Now you're really giving it everything Sha-la-la And you're really getting all you gave Sha-la-la Now you're really living what this life is all about. Now, what would you say… if I told you that… Hey! Everyone thinks you're a crazy old cat? Hey, man, now you're really living. Do you know what it's like to fall on the floor? Hey! Cry your guts out till you got no more? Hey! Hey, man… now you're really living. Have you ever made love to a beautiful girl? Hey! Made you feel like it's not such a bad world. Hey! Hey, man, now you're really living. People Do you know what's it like… Sing! To fall on the floor? Hey! Cry your guts out till you got no more? Hey, man… now you're really living. I just saw the sun rise… over the hill. It never used to give me much of a thrill. Hey, man, now I'm really living. That's very interesting. My doctor brings me a glass of water Okay, Doc, I think this is the place in the movie where I'm supposed to say, “Give it to me straight.” All right. It's worse than your first tests would have indicated. Your other doctors were right. What has happened is a series of lesions, more than 80… have spread across your chest cavity. In the x-rays, it looks like a star exploding. It's an unusually aggressive type of cancer. It's extraordinary, really. Extraordinary? How about that? Mr Griffin, you probably about another year to live, not more than two. So you can't operate? No. Is there anything out there? Anything… in development, or in Europe, or something that can buy me some time? I'm afraid not. You can't save my life? No. Can you validate my parking? Hey, boys, two on one. You think you can beat your old man? You don't even like basketball. Oh, I don't know about that. You know, I've been working on one of those… Yeah, like that. One of them skyhook-type things. I've been practicing. You work all the time. When do you have time to practice? You can't stop me, only contain me. You can only hope to contain me. Come on. What are you doing here? Playing some basketball. You know you're supposed to call first. The frustration and fear of it… is based on society's history of trying to figure out everything… control everything, conquer everything. We've learned to fly, travel in space, bend atoms to our will… but we can't conquer death… I'm sorry, I got… I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Take a seat. Oh, God. I'm so sorry, Sister. And to say God. Keep in mind during this course… that we are all dying a little more every day… and yet… we say… Excuse me, is this Punic Wars One and Two? –I'm sorry, what? –Punic Wars One and Two? Grief… No, this is… uh, Psychological Processes Of Death And Dying. Fear… Yike. And sadness. For when we perceive… I'm sorry, I'm not in… I'm sorry. I… For when we perceive that our moments are finite… well, class, they are finite from the moment of birth. Will it matter? And yet, remember, death is part of life. Excuse me. I'm just changing seats. Go on. Thank you. We lie to children through euphemisms… about three things in life… the bedroom, the bathroom and the grave. I think you should just be a little more serious. –Me? –Yeah. Remember… You shouldn't be laughing at the Punic Wars. Grief, anger… A lot of people died during those wars, you know. –Fear… and sadness… –Both One and Two. Yes, very sad. A lot of people were killed, a lot of Punics. It's one of the reasons you don't see many Punics anymore. Obviously, this isn't interesting to you, Mr… Let me see… you moved. Mr Griffin. Yeah. Sorry. You got me in so much trouble. Are you a student here? I'm the Assistant Dean of Academic Standards for the University. –No kidding? –No kidding. What about you, Mr Griffin? You don't strike me as the prepsychology type. Are you a full-time student here, or are you taking Death and Dying for fun? What's your name? Phoenix, Griffin. My last name is Phoenix. Okay, Phoenix. Uh, no, I'm not a full-time student here. I did take a writing class once, but that didn't go well There was all those… words. I sell life insurance. My company encourages us to continue our education, like this class tonight. Help us deal with, uh… Well, it gives us a better understanding of our customers Ah… Every answer can't be fascinating. No, I guess not. Well… It was fun. Bye. Wait a minute. It's early. I know a really great Italian place. So do I. What's that? What-what are you doing? I mean… what's going on here? I thought… Wasn't something happening? You know, you and I? You and me? Look, Griffin, your quirky charm and… odd knowledge of military history aren't going to get you into my evening, or my life… or anyplace else you were thinking about getting into. It was fun. Let's leave it at that. All right, Phoenix, don't flatter yourself. My life's a little bit complicated right now. So is mine. Fine. Then we understand each other. You may not… know this about me, but I only get bold about every five years, and today is my day. So… if you're seeing somebody, great. If you just broke up and hate men, fine. If you have other problems, you have my sympathy, but since it's my day… I'm just going to tell you where… and when we're going to have dinner together. 7:30, Wednesday night, corner of Bleaker and McDougall. Damn, the name escapes me, but, it's got a yellow awning out front. So if you don't show up, that's all right. That's fine with me. I don't really care anyway. And you were right, it was fun. So, would you like to order something? No, no. I think I'm waiting for someone. Maybe in a minute. Don't get up. Oh, quit looking so pleased with yourself. I just… Good evening. Can I get you something from the bar? Dear God, yes. Um… a Belvedere martini with a twist, please. –Belvedere. You got it. –Thank you. You know what we're going to do tonight? After we eat, when we're done with dinner? We're going to do something… Why don't we wait and see if we can make it through a dinner together first? You're a very strange person. That may be true, but you're here. I don't know what I'm doing. Well, tonight, you're going to do something that you've secretly dreamed of your whole life but never had the nerve to do it. Okay, stop right there. You know, I'm not drunk yet. Get on it. It's just dinner. If you're into some you know, weird sex freaky thing… you know, you've got the wrong girl. To hold me over 'til the liquor gets here What did you have in mind? This is against the law, right? Oh, pretty sure, yeah. What do you think they do to you if we get caught? Oddly enough, very few people have gotten away with what we're about to do. For those who have been caught… it's lethal injection. You did it! All right. I'll open the door, you go inside. That way if you're caught, I can run away. Terrible plan. Okay, let's go together. You ready? Now? Oh. Wrong door. Why? What's the matter? Subtitles. Foreign film. It'll be okay. It's foreign. That means there'll be naked people. Well, there's something. Will you go up to the concession stand and steal me some Milk Duds? Oh, it's impossible. You know, they keep those things under glass. People have been trying for years. There's just no way in. Please. I can't enjoy breaking… Excuse me, sir… but you need to get up right now and come with me to the manager's office. Well, I'd rather not. I understand in a minute there might be some naked people. There are other people in this theater. This is my ship. You're just a passenger, but if you want to have a scene, we can have a scene. No… we'd both like to meet your boss. All right, then. Come on. Actually, I'm glad you came over, because, see, she's been drinking, and frankly, she's just out of control. Would you mind if we stopped and got my Milk Duds? Go down the aisle and out the back door. Go down the aisle and out the back door. You're quite mad, you know that? Oh, my wife, she left her purse is all. Oh… okay. We got runners! What? What y'all looking at? I don't think he's following. That was fantastic. That was so… fun. Yeah. Yeah, it was. You want to walk? As opposed to run? Absolutely. Where to? Don't get me wrong, watching the sun rise is a beautiful idea, but I'm telling you, Griffin… the sun usually comes up in the East. Well… you never know. Always a first time. I've had more fun with you tonight than I've had in a long time. I've had more fun with me than I've had in a long time. If I didn't think I'd start liking you so much, I'd probably see you again. Wait, where did you just go? I thought we were having a fun time, right? You ever not want a new day to start? Why do you think we're facing in this direction? I'm… I just can't get involved with anyone right now. Who said anything about getting involved? Right. No one did. Right. Back to flattering myself again. Thanks for the coffee, and the night out. Don't you want your coffee? Bye, Griffin. Try to stay out of prison. Can I call you? Good morning. Morning, Peri. Oh, my God. You look terrible. First of all, thank you for the nice compliments… second of all, you are so fired. You can't fire me. I'm the only one who loves you. Typed classroom reviews for your signature. You do love me. I'll get you some coffee. I already had some, thanks. You already had coffee? Yes. You had coffee? Oh, my God, you got up early. You never get up early. I don't, do I? Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. Had coffee, look like crap, definitely cranky. You didn't get up early. You stayed up late. You did, didn't you? Bye. Close the door, please. You did! You did stay up late. You are now required to tell me everything. Close the door. You. On the other side. Nothing? I can see clearly now the rain is gone. I can see all obstacles in my way. Gone are the dark clouds that had my blind. It's gonna be a bright Bright… Bright… Bright sunshinin' day. It's gonna be a bright Bright… Bright… Bright sunshinin' day Oh, yes, I can make it now the rain has gone. All of the bad feelings have disappeared. Here is the rainbow I've been waiting for… It's gonna be a bright Bright… Bright… Bright sunshinin' day Look all around… There's nothing but… blue skies Look straight ahead, there's nothing but blue… skies… I can see clearly now the rain is gone… Mr Griffin, as I have been telling you for months, as I am now telling you again, and as… I am sure I will have to keep telling you, what you need is to consider a hospital stay. It's the only way, if you want to slow down the process. I still don't understand why you continue to refuse treatment. We do have the ability to prolong your life. What's left of my life is not going to be spent in a hospital. Not until I have to, anyway. Could you just get me something for the pain? Okay. But since you won't listen to me… if I give you a list, will you at least read some books? Yeah. Yeah, I love books. Need anything else? Just time. You got any on you? No, Mother, you act like I broke up with David. He didn't want me. He wanted to… He wanted to see other people. No. It's hard for me to believe, too. I am so magical. Yes, I know I'm getting older. Thanks for reminding me. I'd almost forgotten. Listen, Mother, I've got to go. I'm having friends over for dinner. No, just friends. Everybody's at the door. I'm hanging up now. You should know I hate surprises. Hate them. Never had anything but bad surprises. They just hit my button, Griffin. Showing up at my work constitutes a surprise. Are you really surprised? I'm thinking about it. Let's go eat and I'll think some more. Okay, then. Sit. Stay awhile. I read that it's important after Indian food to… not operate heavy machinery, and not stand around a handsome man's apartment with your jacket on. I don't know what I'm doing here. You're drinking wine. Have you noticed that we never ask… each other… anything about the other person? Yes, I have noticed. I was just about to ask you about that. Very funny. It's not that I don't have a good time with you. A good time is what you are… but you haven't even asked me what my first name is. Why is that? I don't know. Hey, you like my apartment? See, what I do is, I wait for people to throw junk out on the street, and then I go shopping. I don't want to make small talk about your apartment. Okay What do you want? I don't… I don't know what I want. I don't know what I want. I want to go home. Didn't we do this once already? Good night, Griffin. Good night, Griffin? How about a, “Thank you, I had a nice time?” Thank you. I had a nice time. Good night, Griffin. 2 AM, and she calls me 'cause I'm still… awake Can you Whoever you are. Help me unravel my latest mistake? I don't love him… Winter just wasn't my season Yeah, we walked through the doors So accusing their eyes Like they have any right at all to criticize Hypocrites, you're all here… for the very same reason Because you can't jump the track We're like cars on a cable And life's like an hourglass glued to the table No one can find the rewind button, girl So cradle your head in your hands And breathe Just breathe Oh, breathe Just breathe May he turned… 21 on the base at Fort Bliss “Just today,” he said down to the flask in his fist, “Ain't been sober since maybe October of last year.” Here in town you can tell he's been down for a while But, my God, it's so beautiful when the boy smiles Wanna hold him Maybe… I'll just sing about it 'Cause you can't jump the track We're like cars on a cable And life's like an hourglass… glued to the table No one… can find the rewind button, boys So cradle your head in your hands And breathe Just breathe Oh, breathe Just breathe There's a light at each end of this tunnel You shout, 'cause… you're just as far in as you'll ever be out And these mistakes you've made You'll just make them again If you only try turning around 2 AM, and I'm still awake writing a song If I get it all down on paper it's no longer inside of me Come on, don't be mad. Threatening the life it belongs to And I feel like I'm naked in front of a crowd Cause these words are my diary screaming out loud Hey, Griffin! And I know that you'll use them however you want to Griffin, open the door! It's Sarah! But you can't jump the track My first name's Sarah! We're like cars on a cable And life's like an hourglass glued to the table No one can find the rewind button now Sing it if you understand And… breathe Just breathe Oh, breathe Just breathe Oh, breathe… Here's a question. Of all superpowers, what would you like? Um, I want to, like, have… I want to have heat vision. Heat vision? Wow. I would like to fly, but I would like to fly in a I would like to fly standing up, just a couple inches off the ground. You know? Just more like floating along. –Gliding. –Gl-Gliding. Don't… Remember, don't yank it. Like a lightsaber. Oh, here. Keep the line taut. Can't feel the fish if you don't. Dad? I don't… I don't think… there's any fish out there. Oh, they're out there all right. Nothing like good fishing. Good fishing? This is good fishing? But we haven't caught anything. Well, when you catch something, that's great fishing. This is good fishing. I'm bored. You know what? I'm bored, too. Let's get out of here. That's it. Crank it. That's good. There you go. I'll take that. That wasn't fun, was it? Sure, Dad… it was fun. It was okay. Hey, Kirk, you drive –What? –Here, you drive. Hey, Kirk, you sure you've never done this before? You been driving? No, Dad, it's my first time. Well, son, I'll tell you this for free. You are one super driver. Thanks. And how about… from now on, on our weekends together, we always go out driving? Uh… when I get my license, I want a car just like yours, just like this one. Just like this one, I guarantee it. Are you there? Hello? Hey, what the hell is your first name anyway? Griffin. Yeah. What happened to you? I came back, but you were gone. You were gone, right? Y-Yeah, it's a long story, but I'm home now. Come on over. Was everything all right? Yeah, it is now. Come on over. Hey, Phoenix, this is the best note anyone's ever left me. Phoenix? The thing is… See, the thing is I… I don't think we're such a good idea. What are you talking about? Come on over. We'll talk about it here. I'm just not in a good place. It's just not a good time for me to start seeing someone. Wh… what? What is this on-again, off-again relationship for? You're the one that wrote the note. I'm reading it right now, and it says you want to see me. So why don't you come on over here and… and drink some wine, or make love, or something. I mean, let's get on with it. Hello? I don't know what else to tell you. I don't get it. Help me Help me Bye, Griffin. You got the wrong door. Nobody you know lives here. Open the door. Who is it? It's Sarah. Sarah who? Sarah Phoenix. I thought we were off again. You were wrong. We're on again. So let's get on with it. Okay. What are you thinking about? Just looking at the moon. Wrong answer. Unless by moon, you mean my fabulous ass. Griffin, it's all right. That's the right response. You'd have to say that. That's the truth. It ain't the end of the world. That's probably the only way you could play it. I think it's the advice they give in the women's magazines. Say it's all right. However… it's not all right. You know it's not all right. I know it's not all right. They have these little blue tablets now. Supposedly, it's four hours of magic. I take a medication. I… It's a blood pressure thing. So I can't do that. Okay. I'm not damaged d-down there or anything. Something happened a few months ago. I've had trouble ever since then. What something happened? Something. Okay. Want to know a secret? Holding is very nice. Phoenix. I have two sons in Westchester They live with their mom… and their soon-to-be new dad Thank you. For what? For telling me something about your life. Thank you. Is that where you went the other night? Yeah. My Ex and I had quite the drama. It turns out her husband-to-be is not such a bad guy after all. I've decided I don't like him anyway. Good. Did you get to see your boys? Yeah. I was able to tell them something I… Something I should have told them a long time ago. We had a good talk. Facts of life talk? One of them. That's good. That's one down. Let's have an adventure. All right, well, what else is on your… I've always wanted to do this list? My what? You know, something… you're just dying to do. Fly to Paris… climb Everest… rob a bank, start smoking. There's got to be something. We do have all afternoon free. That's true, we do. What was the third one again? I'm being semi-serious here. We'd need a gun to rob the bank. You have to take this seriously. Pick something else for now. There was one thing I… I haven't thought about this for a long time. Whatever it is, why don't you? Oh, I don't know. Why don't we? You know, we're going to feel pretty silly if this train doesn't… come along. Not as silly as we're going to feel if it does. Come on. Do you think we missed it? Did I make us miss it? Well, the guy at the station said 3:40. Come on, there's a place up here it's got to slow down. I'm sorry I was late. We should be all right. It's just, I didn't know what to wear. What? I changed three times. Don't laugh. It was hard to figure out. I've never hopped a freight train before. What do we do, what do we do? Hide. We've got to hide. You don't have to try and stop the train. Just hang onto it. The train will do the rest. Get up… Okay. Okay? Up, lift your… Okay. Come on, get up… Okay. Bed… Today's the day you hold the… world with… Ready, go right after the tank… Ready. –Ready? –Yeah. Go! Go now, go now… go now, help escalate Angels come down help with this parade… To hear the one who's words will ring Please let him sing Let him be heard This is the time This is the day that we've been waiting for All the world… will stop to watch you shine. This is the time This is the day that we've been waiting for. All the world will stop to watch you shine. We should go out to dinner. I'm starved! How can you live like this, Griffin? How about that new place, the one on West 4th? Hey, I think I found a… Looks like… Dear God, I don't know what it is. Now I know why hobos eat right out of the can. There's garbage on top of the couch. There's garbage underneath the couch. Today on that train was fantastic. It was perfect. Till I realized you weren't there, then it was just kinda perfect. You know, getting off one of those things is a lot harder than getting on. You… We could make a list, you know… Yeah, like today. Things I want to do, TERMINAL ILLNESS things you want to do. We can check them off Maybe invite Kirk and Andy sometime? TALKING ABOUT DEATH choices in the end a look at medical issues and options What a great afternoon. Man, you should have seen your face when you started running. Beautiful. Beautiful. Hey, we should get a camera. What is… this? What are you, some kind of freak? What are you talking… Is this all a game to you? Phoenix, what are you talking about? You think it's funny? This is… some kind of game? You think it's funny to play with… people's feelings? What? I cared… about you. I cared about us. –Phoenix… –I hate you. Damn you. Phoenix! Phoenix… Phoenix, tell me what's going on, please. You go to hell, Griffin. Please, wait. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I won't… wait a second, you ass. What? Hey. Hey, wait. I don't know what happened in there. I… Oh, stop it. Stop it. Quit acting like you don't know. I'm already humiliated. Don't insult me on top of that. What? I'm not. I mean, I don't mean to… but believe me, but I don't know what you're talking about. You know. You know. You liar. Just get away from me, you creep. Now, wait, just… Leave me alone. Stop it. Get off of me, you freak! Stop it. –Get… Get off me. –Stop it. Stop. Neither of us… are going to move until you tell me what's going on. Game's over, Griffin. What game? Get… off her, asshole! Okay, just take it easy… buddy. Why are you playing… with me? You know, Griffin. I have cancer. It started… in my ovaries, and now… How come you have all those books about dying? Why have you been being so nice to me? Why do you have those books, Griffin? Those books are mine. They're for me. I have a chest full of… lesions. That's why I was at the university. That's… That's why I was even in that class where we met. I… I had no idea. I had no idea. Oh… Oh, no. No. I tell you one thing. I have not been being nice to you. I've been being in love with you. So what are we going to do? I guess we're going to die. This is fun. Really, it's a damn Mardi Gras in here. How long are we going to wait for this doctor? Why don't you go work on your car? Go do something? I am doing something. Right, sitting here holding my hand. Not just that. I'm learning how the right swimsuit for my body type can make me look 15 pounds lighter. What do you think of this one here? It'll make your tits look fantastic. Let's leave. You just got to relax. These are the… special times we'll remember. I hope not. Here. Stop fidgeting. A gift? You shouldn't have. It's just like Christmas. I love Christmas. What about you? You like Christmas? I don't know. I guess I'm pretty ambivalent about Christmas now. That's too bad. I don't mind. I wasn't talking about you. I meant it's too bad for your boys. Me, I love everything about it. Christmas tree lights, cold weather, and hot cocoa. Food. All the food, actually. Presents. Mostly presents. Piles and piles of presents, that's my favorite. I love presents. Thanks for my candy. No, no. Please, come in. Oh, thank you. I'm sorry. I didn't want to disturb you. No, no. I need… a little break. Are you all right? Can I get you a glass of water, or… Oh, no… I'm fine, thank you. I just, uh… I'm just tired, that's all. My husband… is not going to make it out of here, I'm afraid. He wouldn't like knowing that. I'm sorry. That's very nice of you. No, he actually he doesn't enjoy much these days, which means… we don't enjoy much these days. So… I guess it's okay. Somehow. I mean, you wouldn't know it to see us now, but we used to be… quite the wild ones. I could see that. He was a pilot. He had his own plane. At one time, he flew us down to the Baja Peninsula in Mexico… and he landed us, uh… way out alone on a deserted dirt road, and we swam in the Pacific Ocean, naked. It was glorious… and he had the sexiest legs I'd ever seen. He still does. I think I'm going to go back in. Do you have children? Um, no. I don't. Oh, well, no. You're still young. You have lots of time. They're important, though, aren't they? Yeah. I've been thinking about the strangest things. I guess it's just some reflex to find comfort. Life is such an odd thing, isn't it? Thanks for the conversation. Stop it, really. I'm being honest. It doesn't matter. It does too matter, and you know it. I'll tell you what matters. I am very happy in all other departments. Very happy, thank you very much. I went to a shrink. You did what? First time I've ever been shrunk. This should be good. Gimme, gimme. Come on, gimme. He told me… he thinks… I cannot achieve such a life-affirming act because I'm so consciously aware that I'm so full of death. Wow. Yeah. And how much did that cost you? $235… for the hour. Wow. Obviously, that's all I have to say today, “Wow”. I was thinking. Let's go to the beach, spend some time. Maybe next week? Can you get off work? I can't ask for any time off. Sorry. It's a bad time. Really busy. I'll quit. You know when you said, “Let's go to the ocean”… one thinks, Hawaii, Bermuda, Palm Beach, even Jersey… not Coney Island. Pretty, ain't it? I quit my job for this. You better be sure to wear this. With that height, I don't think that's going to help. Oh, this isn't to help you. It's so there'll be something they can find to match to your dental records. All right. Let's get you ready. So this is your harness. Save your life. Change your life. Most importantly… it's going to keep you and your chute connected, which is a very good thing. Separate from the boat… float down. Separate from the chute… very bad day. I lose my job. Nobody wants that, right? Where's the guy that was parasailing before? And where's your boat? I'm going to be right back. Can you listen to me for a minute? Yeah. There's something I want to ask you. Okay. If I go f-first… I don't want you coming to see me… in the hospital… or at my funeral, or my grave. Whenever I think it's time… I'm just going to disappear. I'm going to go to the hospital… alone. I'll be like one of those old Eskimos, goes out on the ice floe and… just sits there and waits for the polar bear to get him… and that's that… and I don't want you to come looking for me… and I can't have one of those scenes that we saw in the hospital… with that woman and her husband. No long drawn-out goodbyes. That's really what you want? Yeah, that's what I want. Just promise me. I promise you. It's not going to be an issue, because in about five minutes, you're going to be making a loud splat sound in the Atlantic, so I don't need any instructions from you about the far future, thank you very much. –Are you scared? –I'm okay. Uh, yeah, I'm a little scared. I'm not that crazy about, um, well, heights… and, uh, open water. Do you think they ever found that guy? Well, anyway, we came this far, might as well give it a try. Oh, my God. All right. Okay. So, you ready? Yeah. Did you find your customer? Not yet… but we will. Tide's coming in, so that's not going to be a problem. All right, so the boat's just going to take off, and the line is gonna go pow! I mean, it's just gonna snap straight. You're… gonna feel it, okay? Harness is gonna pull you right up… okay? I mean, right up. So, what you want to do is… you want to hunch into it. You want to hunch your shoulders like that. Yeah. Hunch in. Hunch. Let it pull you up and back like that. Yeah. Up and back. Okay, now… we use hand signals. Thumbs down, he's going to bring you down. Thumbs up, high ride. Okay? You get scared when you're up there, something goes wrong, just scream like a little girl. We can't hear you anyway. I'm just kidding, man. We can hear No, we can't hear you All right, you get into any trouble, for real… you're going to pull this, okay? That's going to release you. Hold on and float down to the water. You afraid of sharks? I'm just kidding, man. I'm just kidd… I'm just trying to get you relaxed, all right? No, seriously, the sound of you hitting the water is going to scare any sharks away. Oh, right. When you hit the water, if you're conscious… what you want to do is get out of the harness… as quick as possible, because the weight from that… is going to pull you right under. We'll eventually find you, but it's a bummer. That's it for the safety stuff, man. You ready? Uh, yeah. Yeah, I'm ready for a for a hamburger, maybe a cold beer. Thanks a lot, man. See you later. I just… spent 20 minutes with you, man. All right, bring it down. Let's see what you got. Well, it's a special day. Today… I have… let's see, pink ones… some very nice big blue ones. Ooh. Oh, wait. I have blue ones, too. All right. Yup, blue ones. Good choice. Those are very nice. Lovely with red meat dishes and pastas with heavy sauces. Didn't know that. Didn't know, excellent side effects. Wow… that's a lot of pills. Yes, we're… collectors. I can see that. Would you like another bottle of wine? Absolutely. I'll be right back. I want to get you a present. Why? What's the occasion? Because… you gave me the train. It's your turn. So… what is it you used to always want? George Clooney. Serious question. Serious answer. George Clooney. I want him, and if you were really my friend, you'd get him for me. Come on, tell me. My father moved us my sophomore year in high school. It wrecked me. I was completely lost. All I ever wanted was to be in the in-crowd. Never got in the “in”. Tried out for cheerleader. Disaster. Tried out for the lead in the Senior play. Painted scenery. That sort of stuff. There was this one thing, though. It drove me crazy I never got to do it. What? Ooh! This is fantastic! What are you doing over there? It's a secret. I can't tell you! You think you're the only one who ever wanted to do this? Give me a hint! It's a surprise! I will tell you this. I love what I'm painting. I love it. It's magnificent. Hey, okay. Yeah! Not bad. Not bad? Everyone's a critic. Well, I don't mean that. I like it. I just… think that mine's so much better. I'll have you know, this is very inspired. Yours is better. I don't think so. I'm looking. No, no, no. Not yet, not yet. No, I want you to see it from down there on the ground. That way you can see it against the stars. I feel so bad for the poor student maintenance worker who's going to have to paint this all gray again. Oh, no. No. No. No gray on this tower. Nope. Nope. Never. This tower is going to live forever! Ah… Oh. Uh-oh. All right, you… up there, come on down. It's the police. –It's the police. –Yes, I'm aware of that. Think maybe they'll go for sleepwalking? Come on! I don't want to ask… you again! Come down off the tower! –We're coming! –Okay, Officer, we surrender. We'll be… right down. Thanks, Scarface. Let's go. Come on down. Do you have money for bail? I only have enough money for one, so you have a very long night ahead of you. –Dammit. –Get down there. I hate this job. You know, I should have been a fireman. They got it made. Yeah? How's that? It's just like this. They go to work, but the people run to them. Well, the women… sure run to them. I know that much. Yeah. We both made a serious vocational… error. You two, oh! Let's go! All right. What are we doing? We're doing a little drinking here tonight, or what? Alcohol? No, Officer. No, no, no. No? Oh, excuse me. I have to… We got… Kirk! Andrew! The cops caught us. You got to come down. Down off the tower! This is the police. You're on the tower, show yourself! Come on down off the tower! Come on, let's go, people. Let's move it! Hey, look, you'd better tell your friends… For fuck's sake. I hate this job. That was close, don't you think? I was so scared… they were going to make us go see… the Piece of Chelief. Whoever that is, I'm glad we didn't have to see him. You know, the boss cop guy. The Piece of Chelief. Do you hear yourself? The Chief of Police. I'm going to go find those officers. I think you lied before. You have been drinking. No, no. When you came to me with your Well, that's something new. Bad dreams and your fears It was easy to see you'd been crying Seems like everywhere you turn Catastrophe… it reigns, but who really profits from the dying… I could hold you in my arms… I could hold you forever I could hold you in my arms Oh, I could hold you forever Ah, ah, ow. I'm a delicate flower. Ah. I-I'm finding that out. Wait What? –Wait. –What? Water Okay Okay Eat your breakfast. First I can't get you started. Now I can't get you stopped. Bitch, bitch, bitch. Crab, crab, crab. What? I'm just looking at you. Come on, let's go back in the apartment. You eat your breakfast. How about we go for a walk. If I don't replenish some fluids, by tonight I'm going to need an I.V drip. We've had lots of the before-glow period… let's enjoy some of the after-glow. Okay. Griffin, I'm happy. Not just… I mean, you know. I'm happy. Don't take that as encouragement. Let's go for a walk first. Maybe hold hands. Remember that? Then back to the bedroom. –King Kong. –King Kong? King Kong, that's the perfect boyfriend. It doesn't take a psychology degree to figure that out. No, that's not it. He was big. Ah, see? I told you. In stature. Big in stature. Plus, he has a big ape heart. Very sexy to a woman, and of course, I'm sure, when called upon, Kong could produce for Faye Wray, a very big banana. See? I knew it. Ah… –Yeah. Stubborn thing… –You look at me when… the truth. –I'm talking to you. –That is the last time that I try and do… –Pretty funny… something nice for you, okay? What? Now you want to cry? You're going to cry? Great! You know what? I'll give you a reason to cry. Get in the car. Get… in the car! –Hey, hey… You need to relax. –Get in the car! Screw you. Why don't you go worry about your own kids? Screw… me? Screw me? Oh, you don't even know screwed. Does she… always talk to you like that? Don't talk to my kid. Is that a baby in your car? You know something? You're a monster. You're a terrible mother. You're a monster. Give me that. What are you doing? Just let go. Let go of my stroller! What horrible, unfeeling, weak God would let you be a mother to any child? Somebody help me! Give me that stroller, God dammit! Give it to me! You crazy bitch! People like you having children. People like you. It's not fair! It's not fair! It's not fair. It's not fair! It's ok. What a nut job. Hey, what you know is nothing. Why don't you shut up? I'm here now. Easy. Easy. So, you want to talk about this? Don't you ever just want to… Punch somebody? Smash something? Let God have it right in the kisser? Just… socko God in the nose? You don't get it. I'm mad as hell, and I got to tell you, I want everyone to know it. Well, today you were successful. Okay, fine. Look, you can bet I'm angry. Let me ask you something. Who am I supposed to be angry at? Who? Everybody? The whole world? Should I be angry at everybody? –Yes. Yes, you should. –Well, I can't do that. I can't believe in fair and not fair. I can't. I can't… blame anyone for this cancer in me. Not the air or God, or… I can't even blame me. It just… happened. It's just what it is. Okay, I don't mean this in any bad way toward you at all, but I don't think taking your emotions out on other people, or other people's property is the answer. It can't be. –There is your problem. –What's my problem? You think there's an answer. Something to put in the box. They're for your sons for Christmas this year. Well, how about you give them the presents? The big one's for Kirk, and this one's for Andrew. I'm telling you, they should come from you. I'm not going to make it to December. No more Christmases. Promise me you're going to make the day a special day for them. Promise me you'll make it a big deal. How about I make it… a big deal for all of us? If you insist on trying to cheer me up, I'm going to leave you. Kiss me. Not if it's going to cheer you up. It won't. Okay. You sure you don't want to come tomorrow? Fresh new paint job. Beautiful day. Big engine just… begging to drink some gas. You go and play. I have some things I need to do. While I'm out, can I get you anything? Everything. I'll pick some up on the way home. Oh, maybe I'm just… maybe I'm just a little tired today. I'm sorry. You… You should not be sorry about anything concerning me, ever. You pay attention. Ever. Phoenix… have I mentioned to you… how much I like you? Well, I mean, I don't mean love. I love you. You know that. You know that… but I like you a lot, too. I'm in like with you, too. It's hard to listen to hard hard heart Beating close to mine Pounding up against the stone and steel Walls that I won't climb… It's hard to know when to give up the fight Some things you want will just never be right It's never rained like it has tonight before… Now, I don't want to beg you, baby For something maybe you could never give I'm not looking for the rest of your life I just want another chance to live Strange how hard it rains now Rows and rows of big dark clouds When I'm holding on underneath this shroud Rain Sometimes a hurt is so deep, deep, deep You think that you're gonna drown Sometimes all I can do is weep, weep, weep With all this rain… falling down… Oh, darling? Your perfect boyfriend is home. I prepared a very special evening for us. I know you'll just go ape over it. Hello? Phoenix? Goodbye Griffin… Strange how hard it rains now Rows and rows of big dark clouds When I'm still alive underneath this shroud Rain Oh, rain… Oh, rain… I'm okay. Hi, beautiful. I knew you'd show up. We promised each other. Yeah. I lied. It's so funny. You know what I've been thinking about? Mm-mm. Last times. Really stupid things. Last time I used pencil. Last time I petted a dog. Last time I played the piano. I've done so many things that I did at some point for the last time and I wasn't paying attention. And then… I met you… and I got… to laugh, and make love… and fall in love… all for the last time. But this time I paid attention. Griffin… go away. There are no more good last things to do. We did them all. What are you going to do, bring me flowers? That's just more dead things in this place. You going to read to me? You going to hold my hand? Are you going to have the nurses… sing Happy Birthday to me? I don't want any of that. I don't need you for any of that. What I need is for you to be the one thing that was perfect. It was perfect, wasn't it? Yeah. We had a beautiful little lifetime together. Don't let that lifetime bleed into this. This is just waiting. Waiting. I want you to go. I want to stay. Well, I want you to go. You were right about this. I want you to go, Griffin, and I want you to go now. I guess you don't need it. I guess you don't want me to repeat it, but everything I have to give, I'll give to you. It's hard to believe it. Even as my eyes do see it. The very things that made you live… are killing you. Listen when… All… of this around us will fall over. I tell you what we're gonna do. Hey. You will shelter me, my love… and I… I will shelter you. I will shelter you… I will shelter you… I will shelter you… I will shelter you All… of this around us will fall over. I'll tell you what we're gonna do Hey. You will shelter me, my love, and I… I will shelter you. If you shelter me, too, I will shelter you. I will shelter you. Thanks. Oh, sure. It was really very educational, actually. I've never actually posted bail for a criminal before. Yeah. Sorry. Oh… No, don't worry about it. I've got to find a hardware store. You want to take a walk? Sure. I got to tell you, Terry and I were pretty surprised when you called. Calling your ex-wife and her fiancé to bail you out of jail is just… different, you know? Well, life's an odd thing, isn't it? I've never been to a New York hardware store before. It's turning into quite a day. What, Griffin? What are you doing here? Just go. Please? I have to say something, and it's important you listen to me. Never listen to me. I mean, I want you to just try and forget all that crap I used to tell you. Especially all that stuff I told you at the beach. I was wrong about all that. I was talking to this idiot the other day, and as he looked back at me from the mirror… I realized that, uh… I was right about one thing. There is an answer, and the answer's being with you. I love you, for better or worse. And this time… this time that we have, this can be part of the better part, because we'll be together, and that way, everything, even this… is better. Good, even. I want to stay… inside. Inside… this real life. I want to stay here. I want to be anywhere you are. I missed you. I missed you. So now you going to let me stay? Of course I'm going to let you stay. I want you to stay. I always wanted you to stay. What did you think I wanted? Shit. Okay. Then I'm not going anywhere. I'll stay here. Except there is something, someplace we've got to go, something we've got to do. What? Do you think you can get out of here for a little while? Griffin, I don't know. It's important. We'll have to sneak out. Okay. Where are we going? It's not far. It's just over here. It better be, really. What are we doing? We're almost there. Here. Why don't you close your eyes? Here. Keep your eyes closed. Here. Step around. Sit. Is this where the polar bear comes to get me? I hope not. I only have enough hot chocolate for two. You've gone quite mad. You know that, don't you, Griffin? Really insane. How many of the pink pills did you take today? Okay, enough. You know I hate surprises. What's going on? What's going on, Sarah Phoenix… what's going on is this… It's Christmas. He jumps in a taxi… For the sky… He's off to slay… some demon… dragonfly. And he looks at me That long last time. Turns away again, and I waved goodbye. In an envelope, inside his coat Is a chain I wore, around my throat. Along with a note I wrote Said “I love you, but I don't even know why” Darling, I wish you well On your way to the wishing well. Swinging off of those gates of hell. I can tell how hard you're trying. I still have this secret hope. Sometimes all I do is cope. Somewhere on the steepest slope Is an endless rope And nobody's crying. Nobody's crying. Nobody's crying. This is a call to all the simple days We spent without a reason Without a care. This is a call to the yesterdays We struggled through the season Then the seasons changed. And we are more alive than we've ever known. ⬄24000÷1001⬄
