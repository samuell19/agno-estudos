Take this. Go! 9 FINGERS Delgado's finished. Long Alley Pavilion Is this what you want? Right. Well. Well, it's a start. Still no news of my brother? Still none. None. You wanna survive it's time to wake up. He gave back the keys. Guys like us don't get funerals. If you want in you gotta finish a job others started. Time to go. Better follow us. You bought a ticket to death... look it in the face. War Council I got this affair from 9 Fingers. I'm still circumspect. I don't see any reason to doubt his word. Call it a fake hold-up. We recuperate tapestries paintings by masters and a series of miniatures. But the real goal is the contents of the safe. The guard is on the take and won't be any trouble. 9 Fingers... strange name. You didn't notice a missing finger from Delgado's right hand? That's his idea of a warning. Before cracking down. Otherwise, he's on the level. What he looks like is anybody's guess. Remind me to call Ferrante. Hello hombre! I'll buy your version of events. You're in. We'll be off soon. One little job is all. You watch the ladies. Tired out! You're mad, you know! They carry the plague. We can go away if you want. The Plague. Yeah well, tonight the roads are blocked. Outside nothing's there for me. Tapestries paintings by masters and a series of miniatures. The real goal is the contents of the safe. You killed my brother. I could take you down you'd end up in the furnace too. Fucking hell! Nothing went as planned! We'd better get a move on. Hello? Yes. OK. No problem, Ferrante. We'll be there. Gerda. Guerda? ACT 2 What's life like on a cargo ship? Prison on a floating factory. Welcome to hell! Sri Ahmed Volkenson 5 Am I warm? Hot as hell! We'll be on this rig a long time. If the others give you hell, ignore them. The road is wide open. So I'm free. With us you're free but not without us. I'll buy that. Last trip? One-way ticket. It'll be getting colder, here. Come on. Mr Kurtz. Ferrante! Hey! What a waste that break-in at the manor! OK, things turned sour. Shit happens. What kind of a mobster is your captain? We said no women on board. Malasorte! As if I didn't think about that! But orders. 9 Fingers again? How's it going, Springer? I must be seasick. I don't like the water. I can't swallow a thing. And how's the wound? Doing what I can. It must be something real nasty. Ain't even a doctor on this heap. You'll have to wait till the next port. Want me to get Kurtz? No, I'd rather rest. Ciao. Magloire! To sum up. OK for the twenty grand and Delgado's fortunate disappearance. So I picked up where they left off. I have a right to know. What did you unearth near the villa? What exactly is it? If I were to say polonium. A highly radioactive, toxic metal produces a maximum of alpha waves. Can be neutralized with a minimum of precautions. Do not swallow do not inhale or you're a goner. You seem to know quite a lot. So what are you worried about? The safe-box is lined with glass and sheets of lead. Springer's state makes a man wonder. I don't get what really happened. We had all the equipment. The plan fit the operation. You remember the famous guy they say was poisoned by the Russians. Ten micrograms in the blood! At two million a dose I find it hard to believe. Too expensive for a deadbeat! Bullshit! The guy was in up to his neck! He was preparing a bomb. Well, he fucked up. He fucked up. The bomb blew up on him before it was supposed to! He was a thief who forgot to take the necessary precautions. Let's say we change subjects. Trust me. We are harmless and have the means to do harm. That's powerful. We could blow up world after world. We are the detonator! I'd say that's not too bad. I'm thinking about VAMPIR a Novel in Tatters and Colors You want to fuck? Exactly. I'm in tatters too. To look in order to see. I just want to see. The problem is sometimes we do see and then we regret. Opiates! Nothing better against sea sickness. Poor Springer could use a hit! Not a thing worth its salt on this rotten ship. Nothing in the hold no crude oil, nothing but poison. Admit it, Captain you're running on death! Admit it, Captain! You're running on what? Street tramps and poisons are in command! Are you in? Ah, Zeitgeist! Why are we this and not that? It's our time that wants it that way. Memories I recall human glimmers of light that will no longer exist! The problem with drugs is to avoid consuming the object of one's commerce to conserve a necessary distance... whereas this leaden case makes you jump overboard rather than glance at its mystery. There's nothing on board? Not a thing. Meaning... We're becoming unhinged! Kurtz is fucking up. The Captain is going mad. Gerda is saving her ass. Ask yourself if the dope helps. It doesn't help at all. It's a means of exchange! With who? Do you see human beings on board? Who's buying? No one. Just yell you'll hear empty containers. We have nothing to sell! Death. And then... This vermin is a snitch! Shoot him! Why commit such thoughtless acts! I do what's necessary to survive. Like the others! Yet I don't give a damn about surviving. Am I an idiot? Yes, I am. To understand nothing. That is the key. Springer and that fucking lead case are getting to me. Going down this path is bound to take us in the wrong direction. I can't see us moving forward. We're imploding by entering this story. Everything is going the wrong way. I don't like it all. What the hell are you doing! You're keeping me awake! It's past five! I don't like this. What don't you like? This Grail of Death! What Grail? What death? In a few days we reach land and it's all over. Now is no time to lose it! I'm trying to think. Impossible! Dementia is on board! Do not ingest. Do not breathe. Do not eat. You might say the plague is on board! Your courage thrills Kurtz. You earn points doing his dirty work. But supposing you have a future with us what are you up to? Traveling through countries of the free zone. Wreaking havoc and the plague wherever you go. Producing disaster with no other alternative than the repetition of terror. You believe in that? I don't. The catastrophe must be set. Manage the madmen as Arlt would say. Every dive has three geniuses between a crazy fool and a cynic. These geniuses don't work they don't do a thing. But well employed, their energy becomes the basis for a new and powerful movement. You and I come from this impure pit and what have we done? We have shifted to the ways of cynicism but cynicism destroys us it's making us sick. Sadness and melancholy brand us like condemned, hunted beasts. But joy returns the instinct of purity. If we don't change our ways we're doomed. If we don't change our ways we're doomed. The world is going down, that amuses us. We profit from that. We believe in nothing! The route comes to a dead end quickly! We must change not completely, not immediately. Revolution promises one, two years maybe the ideal mob recipe. We'll be outdated after that. The time of blood has returned. The time of vengeance. But cities are like whores in love with their pimps. This can't go on? Not so sure! Nothing is less sure! Evil knows its empire. To choose between... I'd rather be shot than end up a suicide! Suicide leaves a bitter taste in the mouth. An execution is perfect. No more executions just straightjackets. That's why we need a revolutionary war. A lawless war. Only suicides of the elderly who have exhausted all possibilities seem to me legitimate. Or even admirable! Syracuse, 14/07/33? I date my books by the day of the death of the author. 14 July 1933. Roussel has held out for 56 years. 56 years! You're not sleeping. It seems no one sleeps on this heap. It's the storm. The storm, the storm. I'd like you to stop frequenting Magloire. Or I'll have you locked up! Outside the sky is spitting lightning bolts. Inside me it's the same. We're going down! Sinking! We're diving! I'm cold without conviction embarked on this ship with merchandise of death. Kurtz pretends to be in command. Ferrante as well. As for me I'm no longer here. Make yourself comfortable. The map is not the territory. Right? A planisphere! A map of the world! Suppose we're somewhere around here. We're crossing the Gates of Hercules Gibraltar. We completely bypass the Middle East for the Atlantic. No that was three nights ago. Now we're... here! Panama Canal! No here! Callao, Peru? Your end is near if you continue seeing Drella. You think you can escape! Look! Here here and here! No future. Roadblocks. Floods. And mud. Mud like the Russian war theatre. Shifting fields. Thousands of dead under the crumbling rubble of buildings. Horses up to their necks in mud. Buried cars. Marine currents spreading. Spreading onto the plains, amoebic monsoon epidemics. Are you vaccinated against diphtheria? No chance in hell. We're going to take power with the plague! This ship is the only life possible! And forget about her! But you're a good guy. I trust you. We disembark in two days at Antofagasta. You know what you have to do. Gerda? OK, yes, you can come. Naturally Ferrante is at the forever empty bar. Naturally. I've just left Kurtz. He's walking on hot coals. He should be. So, we're in deep shit? Indeed we are! Kurtz is totally out of it. What the fuck business did they have at the manor? To be Ir-Ra-diated? You kidding me? And the ladies? That cuts the cake! Look at yourself. Drella, my love. Trouble is we've got the plague on board. A double! You going down to play? With what? With the sailors. All thugs. So what about your bar-geniuses theory? The theory no longer applies. We have the bomb! Precisely, that is reality! No, not reality it's dementia, dementia! It's closing time, sir. The whole world is about to close! This man and I embody the last fissile link! By the way how much are you paid, sir? Rather little, sir. Come along with us! You might be the genius we need. Genius? The genius! We're preparing the Revolution. You're drunk! He's going to believe... No one believes a thing any more. God himself wonders. God? You believe in God? God demands the destruction of this ship. So we shall sink then? Not so sure! Not so sure! God is speaking to the Devil and they're planning grand things. But leave free will to men. Almost always the Revolution is not the cause... but the warning or the punishment! Sir, it's closing time now. Free will? It's up to us to bring Job down! God's too occupied by time. Time defies his control. Time overflows all! That's why there is a delay in the reaction. Its silence! Some speak of relativity. Everything is possible! Everything is possible. Temporarily. But one day everything is adjusted. So God... would be temporarily surpassed by several space times... which is why there is a delay in reaction. Its silence. Sir, it's closing time. That's it! Close this place up! All is temporary. We need an authority over time! Without that, it surpasses us! We are the ones who must be violent with time! We're going to react! The moon shifts. Resupplying ACT 3 How are you? I think someone knocked me out. Turn your head. The other side. Eyes up. Eyes down. It looks like an epidemic is on board. Open your mouth. Wider. Too soon to say. He's only suffered contusions. But I must examine the others. We had an accident. Springer, who was very ill, jumped overboard. Since then, nothing's been right. Have you seen the new crew? Somebody's mocking us! To what drum are we marching? To the Empire of Evil, we are all equal. Usury eats us alive. Everything is for sale. Everything is neutralized. We must be dreaming! I no longer understand Kurtz lied to us. We're not heading toward Callao, Peru. We're heading up north. No, you're not dreaming! One-third of the surface area of Canada is moving across the ocean in the form of waste between southern Japan and eastern Hawaii! We lose track of some of these islands when a storm breaks them up. Islands of Waste are forming a new drifting continent without geological roots. Everything is stabilizing. Mountainous masses are forming. Constrictions appear due to storm activity. Note the formation of artificial canals. I think... their origins are derived from East to West currents which are artificially reinforced by human industry. No doubt. People are consolidating river passages by injecting plastic charges or concrete. So what's going on? Who knows! And this new doctor who just boarded? He has products. So many products! Products, great! But what's happening to us? We're quenching the thirst. Ciao! Our ship has changed its name! Damnation. Neither Kurtz and his phantasmagoria of a new substitute stud nor Warner Oland and his capricious mania for the Zeitgeist nor even Ferrante captive to propaganda through action are capable of awakening me from the dream I've slipped into. Are we truly aboard a Ghost Ship? What's going on! What to say. Our visit by Zodiac to the Island of Waste leads me to wonder not to say perturbs me. Oh, so that perturbs you. Your visit! Absolutely. Which one? It's clear you don't lack imagination. For my part I think Nowhereland is good news! People are working to stabilize a refuge for us. I assure you I have a precise memory of Nowhereland. Formations of ice and ashes that allow for the consolidation of anorganic elements. Nature hates the void! Ash begins, vegetation follows. I beg your pardon. But this island this sub-continent I mean, raises questions. It raises questions if we don't eliminate our main problem! Men, my friend men want to block our enterprise. Eliminate them, end of the story! To an auburn shock on nine cities! Magloire! Kurtz, Warner, and even Ferrante are fucking fucked! Everyone believes they're fleeing but the Doctor is running the Marryat! I thought changing the name of a ship brought misfortune. It's too late now for superstitions. Get up, Magloire! Up. What? What's going on now? We're losing control! Since the layover in Nowhereland nothing's going according to plan. We're sinking. Kurtz can't be found and we all look sick. Nowhereland. The island we got supplies from where the Doctor boarded. And the new crew! But what is it Nowhereland? It's a terrestrial zone where emotions are frozen. Nothing is transparent about the emotional freezing-over that takes place there. Human beings act in a deported manner as if they were condensed. And then the facts come in. An observer could describe them, but there is no observer just accomplices. And now what? You don't get it. Not at all! After Nowhereland we act as if we had lived through an experiment experienced events we did not actually live through. The factual evaluation follows a path parallel to reason to sacrifice itself to a fixed idea. If it's true, it's false! It happened because it had to. It happened because it took place! Who produces what? We deduce! But after Nowhereland it's: What produces whom? Don't you have the feeling that you know Nowhereland while knowing that you have never left this ship? What you're saying is prodigious! That's exactly how I feel. It's enough to drive one mad. What does it all is the genitive, not the ablative! We are Nowhereland. We have to get off this ship. We're falling like flies. But who what is poisoning us? I want to go too. But it's not that simple. You can't even breathe on this bucket! We could start all over again. Start all over? The story about trafficking no longer holds water. In exchange for death, what do we win? Nothing but Death! Death! I'm no longer interested. I'm not playing any more. I greet you, Old Ocean O greatest of celibates! You are more beautiful than the night. Tell me, Ocean Will you be my brother? Spread out your livid claws And tear yourself out a pathway in your own bosom. Roll your appalling breakers hideous Ocean Understood by me alone And before whose feet I fall prostrate. Man's majesty is borrowed. It shall not overcome me. You, yes. Continue with the veronal and the soneryl the infection is going down. And don't forget the preparation I made for you. Things are looking better, looking better. Kurtz is nowhere to be seen. He's recovering, recovering. By the way how is that Magloire fellow? He's recovering, recovering. I don't dare go down to play any more. It's cutthroat! Ever since Kurtz has gone AWOL the Captain and the sailors think anything goes. I lost big time the last time I played cards. Nothing but cheating going on. That said, it's not all bad without Kurtz. True. It seems we're headed down toward Valparaiso. To believe the Captain it's Doc running the ship now. We're headed back up North the same way we came. Snap out of it. The real question is finding a port to disembark at. Then you can run off with Drella. That's what you want, isn't it? You need cash. Cash. Hey, we were worrying about your absence. Bad news. Gerda is dead! They found a box of sleeping pills near her bed. Gerda is dead. Like I said. And Drella? Things are looking better. Looking better. For Callao, we're screwed. Our cargo intrigues them seriously. Antofagasta is still far away. And the weather is not on our side. We'll try to reach Iquique. We have a contact there. You get that? I think so. Where are we? It's still raining. The Doldrums. The Doldrums? The sailors call this zone, the Doldrums. It's a low-pressure zone that corresponds to hundreds of kilometers from north to south of the Equator. The Doldrums are formed by the convergence of masses of hot air and humid anticyclones coming from the tropics. The clouds before noon turn into afternoon storms. Your blood pressure is not good. These are Atalanta Fugiens pills. Take one right now. Then, 3 every 24 hours. 1 every 8 hours. No more. It's potent stuff. All right. You don't look well. Something eating at you? It's like I'm reliving scenes I've already experienced. It's really unpleasant. The feeling of being blocked, as if by a curse. Tell me what do you really think about Nowhereland? It's a filthy zone. That's not the word that comes to mind. I'd say it's a temporary zone. Everything is temporary. We all come and go temporarily where we can. Nowhereland is an exception. Everything starts over again there. You'll see. I wish I understood. So, 1 every 8 hours? Exactly. But I thought that approaching this continent without a map was dangerous, in the sense that it's not organically agglomerated. Nature is taking back her rights there. Precisely what I was saying Temp-o-Ra-Ry! It's a virtual zone where all can start-all-over! Don't forget. 1 every 8 hours. Good evening! Forget about it Springer was a threat to everybody. Kurtz had nothing to do with it. Springer threw himself overboard. Just like that, all alone in the light of the full moon, in a bout of melancholy. Yes, just like Gerda! If I remember correctly, Delgado, Drella's brother didn't flee simply to steal $20,000. He deserted a situation that stinks! Trafficking in filthy shit leads us to... Exactly where it should lead us. Gentlemen, I must leave you I have an appointment. One hell of a doctor! He's got nerve. And Kurtz who still thinks he can follow the maps. The stakes have changed. Now we're aboard the Marryat. Assassins! We've brought assassins on board! The Painting of the Assassins I'd like to know if we're still working in the same direction. In the same direction? We're still heading south. I understand that the stop at Nowhereland has changed the stakes somewhat. That was the plan, to get supplies and fuel and to bring the Maestro aboard. I mean the Doctor. To deal with the epidemic... No Mr Kurtz wants to discuss the polonium. Polonium is on everybody's mind if I'm not mistaken. Yet... Polonium isn't worth a thing. It's a mistake. This world is a mistake! I know, Captain. What do we have left to inverse destiny or time? The ultimate poison! Besides, polonium is merely the fuse... Gentlemen, we're veering off path. Yes, everybody knows. But who's in command? You, Doctor? Or the Captain? Or myself? Who sets the routes and the objectives? We're linked like the fingers of one hand except that we can always rid ourselves of a useless finger! It was never my intention to... That's enough! So, we're going to disembark. Exactly! If the weather allows. Polonium lies in the holds. For what reason do you think? 1 gram is enough to poison 100,000 people half of whom will die for sure. Imagine... there are 10, 15 or 100 cargos en route on the seas! Air travel is controlled, not the ocean. There's one problem. Supplies! As we have seen! And now what? Now it's between Kurtz and the Doctor. Who will eliminate the other? For me, the game is over. Unless we get seriously involved. Kurtz, with his mania for exchange, is dreaming! And we, with our Zeitgeist. But it's true. The Spirit of the Time rules! You can't vanquish time! We have come. We are among the assassins and the cynics! Except that they're dreaming. They think they can beat time, but it doesn't work that way. Everything is on our side if we want it. But we must act quickly. We're gangsters after all. The others are merely assassins. Look closely at those men. They're vice incarnate. Terminal trash! Imagine what's in those paint guns! How to heal ourselves? Pass along the shame of the species? Fill in the deficit? Attack an other life far away anterior when we said: Let's go to Katchenko find love in a bordello and curse the West! I'd rather leave you than jump. I'll never have that courage. No, it's awful. Would you jump? No. I won't jump. That's stupid. That's stupid! Nothingness. Thank you, Magloire for having intervened during the meeting. You noticed land in the distance. It's as if we've come back to where we started. Nowhereland! In the morning I steer us toward our routes... But it's as if the damned ones, the new sailors oppose them during the night and bring us back to where we started! It's not South America we see out there. We have brought assassins on board I kid you not. And the Doctor... I don't know! We have to return to land. Yes, we have to stick together! We're gangsters, aren't we? For sure, I prefer gangsters to assassins. What do you want, killing is sometimes necessary. It goes with the job but it's not our profession. Who will you give up our "light" cargo to? I don't know exactly. It was a contract. The contract looks dead if you ask me. How so? You know. 9 Fingers is death! The text you repeat, we all repeat over and over again, is bullshit! There is no other way out. We have to disembark and flee by land. With or without the polonium! With it is better. You, a revolutionary now? The briefcase is missing! Probably disembarked at Nowhereland. What about the Doctor? He seems inspired. It's as if he fell from the sky. The Doctor will fall ill. We'll see about that. Since we obviously seem to be the dupes in this affair let's pretend to be the organizers. Right! Let's pretend to be the organizers. Gerda! The Doctor's Flight with Drella I told you so. This cargo ship is empty. Nothing but shit. Let's go, open it! From Marryat to Elseneur. From Marryat to Astrolabe. From Marryat to Terschelling. Dead addresses! It's a Ghost Ship. Never accept mail from a Ghost Ship! Nail it to the mast say the precepts. We're done for! Unless we set it all on fire. I don't get it. The Marryat is a Ghost Ship? Not the Marryat nor the Sri Ahmed Volkenson V! It's Nowhereland itself. The island drifts incessantly and it continues to grow in size. Look we're transporting containers just like mail. If we fail to act, we risk turning indefinitely around this atoll of plastic and ashes to sink into the depths forever. We're possessed. The Marryat is done for and re-done! You say that Nowhereland is a Ghost Ship!? Precisely! Nowhereland has no terrestrial roots. We have not ceased turning around it. Like it has a magnetic force. But this cargo... This ship, call it what you like the Marryat, or the Sri Ahmed Volkenson V is no more than a secondary shipwreck. So let's set this filth on fire! Ghost! It seems the storm has passed. Looks like it. No news of the others? None. Any idea where we're at? It looks like they put all the fires out. You can't locate anything? No location readings, but they're out there! Out there? Who? You see something? The crew of polonium painters! We can't see a thing. What do you expect! We're going nowhere. Are we far? Far from what? Stop being so enigmatic! Warner wait here! We're going for help. Strange sun! You call that a sun? Subtitles: Joseph Simas Subtitling: HIVENTY
