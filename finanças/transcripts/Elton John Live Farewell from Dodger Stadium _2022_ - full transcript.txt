Hello, and welcome to Elton John Live, Farewell from Dodger Stadium. I'm Kirsten Watson, and I'm so happy you have joined us for what will be, a historic and emotional night as Elton John plays his last show of his last ever American tour. And what better place to end it all than right here at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles. A venue with such rich history for Elton. Forty-seven years ago, back in 1975, he played two sold-out shows here that are still remembered today with legendary status. It was a defining moment for Elton. And in just under 20 minutes, Elton John will be back on that stage right here. And he has a magical night planned for us all. Along with his legendary band, his longtime collaborator, Bernie Taupin, will be making an appearance and Elton will be joined by some phenomenal musical guests. We're going to see performances by Dua Lipa, Brandi Carlile and Kiki Dee who sang the chart-topping duet, "Don't Go Breaking My Heart." We caught up with these incredibly special guests and Elton himself in rehearsals earlier today. When you duet with people, you get something from it. When you record with someone you haven't met before or worked with before, you learn something because it's so much fun, you bounce off each other. ♪ Don't go breaking my heart ♪ Kiki Dee was at Dodger Stadium the first time and"Don't Go Breaking My Heart" was a huge hit for us. I wanted her to be there for the last show. I'm so excited to be back here. It was such a magical time. I was in my mid-20s, getting to play these amazing places. And working with one of the funniest people I've ever met, Elton John. Elton John means everything to me. He's my greatest hero of all time since I was 11 years old. He was my gateway drug to rock 'n roll, my gateway to doing music, writing songs. He's everything to me. He's my favorite of all time. Elton John is... is my musical hero. And when I get up on stage and I get to sing the song that we… we did together, it really is… you know, a massive moment for me. ♪ When are you gonna come down? ♪ Bernie Taupin and Elton John, I think, are one of the most miraculous partnerships of all time. and they're the only ones like them that ever existed, and I think they're the only ones like them that ever will exist. Bernie's lyrics are so cinematic. You see them, you taste them, you feel them. He's the greatest lyricist of all time. ♪ Singin' the blues ♪ The last time we played Dodger Stadium in 1975, it was certainly ground-breaking because people weren't playing stadiums back then, you know. But there's much more significance to it now, I think. So it's really… a huge, huge situation to be back here again. I think it's going to be quite an emotional show. Elton has left such a mark, musically, on the world. And to get to see it come to life for, you know, the last time here at Dodger Stadium in LA, it's going to be emotional. It's going to be emotional. I try and record with younger artists because I'm 76, and I'm still feeling I have so much more to learn. Not just through music, but through every facet of my life. And I love that. It keeps me going. It's just wonderful. It gives me energy, and it really, really makes me feel happy. My dear friend and eternal brother Elton, as you celebrate this historic milestone in your life, I just wanted to give you a huge shout-out for all that you've achieved and all the gifts that you've given us over the past 50 years, man. There will never be another one like you, Elton, and I know the next 50 will be just as impactful as the last. So keep on keeping on, my brother. I love you. Forever. We just wanted to send you a message because as you head into your last show in the US, what an incredible, incredible career. And to have performed at the highest level like you have for so long and still have the passion that you do is really incredible. We are so proud that we can call you our friend, the godfather of our children, as well. And you have inspired us in so many ways. We've known you for so many years. And we love you so, so much. And so many amazing memories of summers that we spent together, shows that we've been to. I mean, it's quite incredible. We are so proud of you, and I'm sure tonight is gonna be a super emotional night, but I'm also sure that you are so excited at the prospect of spending more time with your incredible husband and your amazing children. It's amazing what you've given to the world and given to us. I hope you're okay. I don't really believe that it's your last concert, but... congratulations, if it is. And... I hope you feel as great as you make everybody else feel. Bye. If anyone can take us to Mars, it's the rocket man yourself. Thank you so much for all the magic you have given to the world, for all the light and love that you have spread through your music, through your authenticity. I love you so much. All right, Elton, congratulations and good luck with your final show tonight. I've made this video a couple of times. I've known you for many, many decades, and the first time we met was in Los Angeles at the Forum. And you were wearing a Minnie Mouse dress. And you looked gorgeous, as you still do. I love you, my friend. Congratulations. Elton John, you cannot say farewell to anybody, but congratulations on your farewell tour. Oh, my God, I can't believe this is your farewell tour. Thank you so much for all you've done for so many people, including myself. Much love. Love you. Do you remember in the early '70s when you and Cher and I did her first television special all by herself and we played old people in a rest home? I never thought the day would come. Sometimes, I do feel like that. Oh, my goodness, what a career you've had. Full of laughter, full of fun, full of music, full of great costumes. What a… And full of generosity. In fact, I am wearing a necklace that you gave me over 50 years ago. You are the bomb, baby. So, Elton, tonight, tonight, of all nights, sit back, relax, enjoy this ride, because... I can't believe I'm going to say this. I mean, you say this is the last show of the touring, but... all I can say to you is, I love you, man, enjoy this night. I'm sorry I can't be there with you, but... kill it! We are getting ready for Elton walking on that stage in just a few minutes. And you can feel the excitement in here. But it's not just a big night for Elton. We'll be making some television history of our own. As you are joining us for the first-ever global live stream on Disney Plus. Well, let me tell you, this atmosphere has been building in the stadium all week. We got a chance to catch up with some of Elton's most loyal fans. We drove from Utah for 12 hours. I flew from Switzerland. All the way from New York tonight. The fact he loves Elton John so much really just kind of hypes me up even more. As somebody that's in the LGBTQ community, he is everything to me. This was a momentous occasion for me but also to close out the place that made him a legend. He's such a huge part of our lives. And that 1975 photograph of him playing at Dodger Stadium, I want to revisit that. ALL: Cheers, Elton! The bees is back! (hooting) Last time I was here at Dodger Stadium was October 25, 1975, where I was a backup singer for Elton John, when we did the two dates at Dodger Stadium. It was absolutely other-worldly. It was like everybody was in that moment at the same time. And, uh, I get chills just thinking about it, and I got chills that night. I was 13 when I came to see Elton John, my first ever rock concert. And I just fell in love with him. And to know that this is the last time and to be at the place where I first saw him is like so special. It's like, it's a dream. It's a dream. It's my first concert and Elton's last concert, so I'm really excited. When Elton John takes the stage tonight, I'm going to be real excited. I'm going to come up and start singing. I've been a fan of Elton John for a couple years, since I was eight or nine. My favorite Elton John song is"Tiny Dancer." "Rocket Man." I love that song. I really, really hope he plays "Crocodile Rock." ♪ B-b-b-Bennie and the jets ♪ (mumbling) I've learned a lot from Elton being a piano player myself. I'm glued to his hands most of the show. And when they show his hands on the screen, I'm just glued to that, 'cause I want to see what he's doing. For me, that's… It's like having a piano lesson in a stadium full of 55,000 people. I'm going to cry. I know I'm going to cry. I got my bubble head T-shirt, my VIP pass, my glasses. Cheers to Elton. (smooches) I love you! We're both originally from Mexico. So this is a bucket list. (chuckles) Like, he's one of those people that's lasted generations. We could not miss this concert for the life of us, I actually went last week in Phoenix and saw him in concert. And saw him back now because I'm such an Elton John fan. Love it. I love Elton John because he is the best. We're just super excited. Like the circle of life, right? This is his final show. This is a religious experience in many ways. And as such, we need to wear Sunday best. Every one of his hits is a hit. To be back here tonight is an honor, a privilege and I think I'm probably going to cry. Elton, congratulations on this very special moment in your life. We are all so grateful for your music. Thank you for being the soundtrack to our lives. Thank you for doing all the work you've done to fight AIDS and to make so many lives better. We appreciate you. Your music will be part of American life for eons to come and everywhere else in the world, of course. May this show be as formidable as the thousands that preceded it. I know it will. Corny sentence alert. I know you will feel the love tonight. Sir Elton John, this is H.E.R. I just want to say thank you so much for inspiring artists like me with your fashion and your music, your playing, your performing. We love you and we appreciate you so much. Thank you. (smooches) Elton, we wanted to say congratulations, and we love you so, so much. We feel so lucky to know you and just like every audience member at these shows, what a privilege that you're doing these live shows for us one last time. Congrats. (smooches) Elton, it is your final night in the United States of America performing for the American people. It is a long way from the troubadour. I can't believe it's true. I can't believe that I'm here. I refuse to believe it. We know it's gonna be magical because your songs are so good. You got so many of them. It's really not fair to the rest of us, but we do hope that you have a great show tonight and we love you so much. Knock 'em dead. I cannot believe that tonight is your final show. I want to wish you the best of luck. It's going to be the best one ever. You have changed the world, the music industry forever. You are a legend. Thank you for sharing your gift with everyone, and have the best show. We all love you. Thank you so, so, so much for your beautiful music and for bringing my family together through your wonderful songs. It was my extraordinary privilege to portray you in the movie of your life. And for one final time at Dodger Stadium, I would like to say to you, knock 'em dead, rocket man. Thank you for being on this earth and blessing us with your gifts as a musician and as a human being. You have been there almost every single stage of my career and all the ups and downs of my personal life as well, and I'm so happy to you know as a person. You are like a mentor, a friend and also my musical hero. And I'm just very, very proud to be your friend and, yeah, hope you have a great gig. And good luck. I know it's time for you to retire, so you say, but I miss you already. I love you. You are one of the greatest people I've ever met. (smooches) Happy retirement. You going to have some spare time on your hands? Maybe you can come join us and jam at the house here. (chuckles) That would be fun. Love you! (audience cheering) All right. Well, it's not long until we see Elton right up there behind me. But before that, we wanted to tell you about another Disney-Elton collaboration coming soon from Disney Original Documentary is a new film from directors RJ Cutler and David Furnish, Goodbye Yellow Brick Road: The Final Elton John Performances and the Years that Made his Legend. But now, let's hear from the man himself. After more than 50 years touring around the world, tonight we will witness his last ever US show on his farewell tour. So of course, we had to ask Elton why he felt now was the time for his touring days to come to an end. (piano music playing) Well, I started in Los Angeles, The Troubadour Club. That's the first place I played in America. It was vital I finish in Los Angeles. Dodger Stadium has history. And I have history. And I want to go out inside of a place that has atmosphere and aura to it. I'm revisiting the past in hopefully a glorious kind of way. We sat down and conceived this tour so many years ago, seven years ago we started this journey, he said, "I want to go out on a high." (chuckles) "I want to go out on a high and I want to go out in a big way." And, um, this is bigger and more all-encompassing than we ever could have imagined. And to be doing the last three shows at Dodger Stadium with all of that history behind us is a… is a truly magical thing. The first, um, Dodger Stadium show was in 1975 were… hard for me because I wasn't in a very good place mentally and physically. The difference now is that I have a husband and someone I've been with for 29 years, two sons, Zachary and Elijah. My life is completely different. I'm sober. I've been sober and clean for 32 years. I'm ending in the happiest time of my life. I've never been happier. So compare that to 1975 when I wasn't happy. It's wonderful. He's back on top of the charts, uh, with, you know, hit singles with Dua Lipa and Britney Spears which is where he was in '75, but I think, most importantly, he's really happy as a father and as a family person because our relationship is wonderful and we have two of the most beautiful sons. I always explain to the audience why I'm stopping. And so I may bring the kids on. I haven't decided yet because I want them to see why I'm stopping, see how much I love them. That is what Elton is most excited about and we're most excited about as a family is the opportunity to spend time together, um, off the road because Elton is always touring. INTERVIEWER: What are you going to miss about touring? Nothing. Nothing. I've done it since I was 17 in the back of a van with my first band. I can't imagine how many miles I've covered in that time between then and now. I love music. I like playing live, but I've played enough concerts, and I can't really do a better concert than I'm doing now with a better stage or a better production. I'll certainly miss the joy that doing live shows brings Elton. Selfishly, I'll miss seeing him perform live myself. I love going to an Elton show. He's a brilliant entertainer and playing and singing better than ever. But… As he says on stage, he says, "I've had more than enough applause and more than enough love from an audience in my life." And he's really looking forward to the stage where he can, you know, put that beautiful chapter of his life behind him and move on to the next one. The audiences on this tour have been so loving and so kind they're dressed up and they're wearing glittery glasses and outfits from so many different albums, uh, Dodger Stadium outfits. It's just astonishing holding up placards to say how many shows they've been to. It's like, "Wow." It's like, "You are spending all your money just to see me." And it makes me feel good. There was a time in my life when I didn't think about that so much, but I certainly do now. And especially on this tour. It's the most gratifying thing. You want your music to be heard by every generation. They are as old as me and seven or eight kids in the front rows little boys, little girls singing all the words to all the songs. I'll be going, "How the hell do you know the words?" When you see an eight-year-old kid singing your song, you are just like, yeah. He's created music that he hopes will survive and stand the test of time. And I know, for him, personally, he can't think of a better compliment than the fact his music still resonates as strongly today as it did in the day that it was created. It's really hit home how lucky I've been, how great my fans are. It's a lovefest between me and them and them and me, and it's just so exciting. Thank you, everyone. Elton, we love you. -Hi, Elton. -Hi, Elton. -We just want to say congratulations. -Congratulations. And that we are just so proud of you. We're so grateful that we were able to see you on your farewell tour also. Um, and thank you for… Thank you for entertaining everybody for so many decades. Thank you for being the friend that you were for my mom. Thank you for being our friend, thank you for being friends with our kids, and thank you for entertaining people right around the world. Um, even though this is officially your retirement, uh, this will not be your last gig, we know that. Um, but we love you. And congratulations on an incredible career. You are simply one of the greatest of all times. Not because your iconic song but because your absolute courage. You turn pain into purpose and your advocacy has literally saved millions of lives. Elton, as you close this chapter of our story, I hope you know that your legacy has no end. From the timeless songs that have given voice to our joys and sorrows, to how you've inspired countless people to stand up and speak out, you will always be here on our playlists and in our hearts. On behalf of the American people, thank you for moving the soul of our nation. Thank you. Thank you. (audience cheering) Honestly, I don't know how I can follow that, so let's get on with it. The time has come for Elton John's last ever American show on his farewell tour. On the stage that made him a legend. Live from Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, please welcome Elton John.

This is a very special night for me. A very emotional night for me. And, uh… (clears throat) it's been a long journey and, uh… (audience cheering) I first came here to America in 1970 to the City of Angels, Los Angeles. And I played at a club called The Troubadour Club, which thankfully is still there. And it helped me. It accelerated my career in America with a review I got from Robert Hilburn from the LA Times. And I'm so… I'll never forget that. And I had an album out at the time called Elton John. My first single from that album was called "Border Song." When we put our single out, Aretha Franklin covered the song and put her version out. And so, Bernie and I, being young English kids and young songwriters, we're so knocked out, so flabbergasted that the Queen of Soul had recorded one of our songs, that it was probably one of the most exciting things that had happened to us up to that point in our career. And in the years that followed, I got to meet her and thank her for it. And I sang with her and I recorded with her and I played with her. And I hung with her. And it was just a surreal experience to be in the company of such genius. And her last ever show was in New York City, at St. John the Divine Cathedral for the Elton John AIDS Foundation. And she was really, really sick. It was six months before she passed away. She was this thin. And before the show began, I went backstage and said, "Aretha, let me do it. You're so frail. I'll do it, it's not a problem." And she said, "Honey, two years ago, I was supposed to be here, and I let you down. I'm not letting you down again." And she came out and sat at a piano like this one with an incredible band. And for an hour and 20 minutes she blew the roof off the cathedral. And those of us that were lucky enough to be there, 1500 people, were in tears because it was an incredible performance under the circumstances. And I think she was inspired by her surroundings, but it was phenomenal. And so I want to dedicate this song to the lasting genius and legacy of Aretha Franklin.

Okay. Thank you. ELTON: Okay. This is the time of the evening where I introduce the musicians and singers. That is the band. Now, I've had a lot of bands in my time starting off in 1969 with the late, great Dee Murray on bass guitar and vocals, and Nigel also in drums and vocals. And since then, many musicians and many singers have played with me on stage. And I can honestly say they've all been great, and I've learned a lot from each and every one of them. So I've been inspired all through my career by great musicians. But this band I have now, I say, is probably the best one. Save for the first one. Because every night I come on stage, they play so well, and they inspire me to play well. And they are just fantastic, fantastic musicians and people. So I'm going to introduce them one by one. And you're going to give them a final Dodger Stadium roar, okay? I want to hear you. On the right-hand side of the stage, on percussion and vocals, John Mayhorn. (audience cheers, applause) On keyboards, our keyboard wizard Kim Ballard. (audience cheering, applauding) And bass guitar and vocals, Matt Bissonette. (audience cheering, applauding) One of the greatest musicians I've ever played with, and one of the most interesting people I've ever met, who has been in and out of the band since 1973. I'm so grateful that he's on the Farewell Yellow Brick Road Tour. Because he adds so much to this musically. In 1979, he and I went around the world and played 120 shows just the two of us. And it was an extraordinary musical experience for me. So I'm grateful to him for that. He's played with everybody there is to play with, basically, on stage and record. On percussion, Ray Cooper! (audience cheering, applauding) He was playing drums in 1969, and he was singing in 1969 and he still is, 53 years later, Nigel Olson. (audience cheering and applauding) (inaudible) Of the madman across the board, I wanted to add another texture to the band and I wanted to add a guitar to the bass and the drums and the piano. And Davey Johnstone have played acoustic guitar on the Madman Record. So I asked him to join the band for Honky Château. And we all went to France, to the hotel, to the Château, the Real, and Paris, and Davey walked into the studio, and picked up an electric guitar for the very first time. And as you can hear, he has never looked back. He's my band leader that gets everybody together here in Los Angeles, and rehearses them, so that when I come over, I have very little work to do. So thank you, Davey. Um, and he's from Edinburgh in Scotland. And he's fantastic. On guitars and vocals, Davey Johnstone! (audience cheering, applauding) During my lifetime on stage, I've lost four great musicians. First of all, Dee Murray on bass and vocals. Roger Pope on drums, Guy Babylon on keyboards, and Bob Birch on bass guitar and vocals, and they were such great members of the band on stage and on record. So I would like to dedicate this song to the memory of those great guys.

(cheers, applause) (cheers and applause continue) Okay. It's been 50 years of touring in the United States, across all 50 states, and this is my seventh concert here in Dodger Stadium. Uh, my first concert here on October 25th and 26th in 1975. And tonight, is the 271st show of the Farewell Yellow Brick Road Tour. And my 103rd concert in the Los Angeles area. So, before we continue, I would like to thank all our crew, all the musicians, everybody involved in this show since, uh, we were in, uh, New Orleans in January. We've been in a Covid bubble, all of us, since then, and I only see the band when I come on stage. Everyone has been magnificent, um… Oh, I hope they have the best Thanksgiving and the best Christmas. Um, and I'd also like to introduce somebody who, if it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be sitting here right now. Come here. Come on, Mr. Bernie Taupin! (cheers, applause) We've been writing together now since 1967, and we still are, we still love each other more than we've ever done before. He's an amazing guy. I love you. Thanks for all the gifts. Hey, is this the greatest band on the planet? -Right? -(cheers) And as you know, I am stopping touring, and this will mean my last concert in America and Canada. And the reason why I'm touring, I think you know, is because I want to spend time with my family because I'll be 76 by the time I stop next year. So, I want to bring them out, and show you why I am retiring. David, Zachary and Elijah. (cheers, applause) (cheers, applause) ELTON: Thank you all for dressing up. It makes me so happy to see you when you wear the most fantastic costumes, and you've been to so many shows. Eighty-seventh. Hundred and something over there. Hundred and ninety-fifth show. Their first show over there. Um, yeah, baby, '67, '62, uh, 42nd, and I can't see over there. A hundred… just 185th? Wow. Blimey. Well, you know what, I became successful first in America, and you bought the singles and the albums and the eight tracks, the cassettes, the CDs, and, uh, more importantly, you bought the tickets to the shows which I love more than anything is to play live. Um, so I want to thank you for that because you made me. Without America, I wouldn't be here. So thank you for all the years of love and generosity and loyalty. (cheers, applause) I wish you health and love, prosperity. Prosperity. Be kind to each other, okay? And farewell.
