- He came here once. - Paulius? He'd just gotten out of prison. Asked for your Paris address. You didn't give it to him? I didn't think you'd want to see him. You could've gotten his number. I didn't want you to see him. Vilnius, January 1989 You know her? No. - Well, I do. - Who is she? A star pupil. Nothing wrong with that. Maybe. Jana! Let me introduce you. Paulius... Jana. Hi. I'm going straight to the national team! Seriously, I do play hockey. They want me on the national team. And I cycle. Lukas and I are on the junior team. I can't ride a bike. - Everyone can! - Not me. So you suck at sports. No, why? I love to swim. I hate swimming pools. I like to skate, but this rink is new to me. The biggest hockey games are held here. - Everyone knows this rink. - Not me. I go to the one near my home. - Paulius really likes you. - Really? I don't get it. Me neither! - Thanks for that. - I'm joking! - The second he saw you... - You're teasing me. You saw it yourself, he's interested. Maybe. I wasn't sure. Well, I'm sure. - It's so obvious. - Cheap talk. Want me to ask him? No, thank you. So... - See you. - Bye. - Why'd you leave yesterday? - I had things to do. What? - This and that. - This and that? And what about now? I'm interested in what you do. Hey. Hi. You fixed it? I think I found the problem. I just needed to adjust the derailleur. - Is it a Positron? - Yeah. Is that a new KTM? - It is, yeah. - A new KTM. - Wanna try it out? - Sure. - Are you coming? - Where? To the bus stop. Cool, right? Check out the stitches. Where did you get them? From a guy on the black market. He sells them triple the price. Where do you get the money? I have my ways. - Later, guys. - See you. We trade rubles for dollars. How? Everyone does it. Didn't you know? I've heard about it but didn't know you did it. How do you think people make money? - Who do you trade with? - Foreigners. - What foreigners? - Germans. There aren't many. How can everyone do it? Maybe not everyone, but we do it. Isn't it dangerous? - I don't know, maybe. - Very! - Ok, I need to go. - Me too. - Where to? - Home. I told you she's a star pupil. We all have responsibilities. Look at you. At least it was my own decision. Fine, get lost. Bye. Anyway, everything's going to change. Seen the universities now? Even the high schools are changing. What will you major in? Maybe architecture. Cool, we'll bump into each other. I hear they have really good new professors who remember that architects like Shukhov and Melnikov existed. So, if there are new professors who think differently, there will also be new students. And things will change, you'll see. We're going to university in the midst of change. I'd love to believe you. Me too. Hello. Hungry? Yeah. I'll heat it up. What's that? The new book by Gavelis. Someone retyped it. - Seriously? - "Vilnius Poker." What's that? "Vilnius Poker." Poor you. Glad I can skip all that. It's pointless. What do you know? Study architecture, then talk. To build another Union Palace? If everyone thinks like you, nothing will ever change. How long before you get busted? I'm not that dumb. You won't do it forever, right? I know people who do it for years and survive. And I know some who got busted really quickly. You do it your way, and I'll do it my way. Exactly! How long will you last? I can carry on until I leave, easy. - Where to? - Germany. You're leaving? It's the only way out. But it's impossible. Plus, change is coming now. What change? Nothing will change here. Everyone talks about change, but that just fuels the propaganda. I won't sit and wait for change. I'll make it happen myself. Paulius will start a new movement. Very funny. Come on, let's leave these two alone. Do you want me to quit it? Yes. Then what would I do? Same as us. You? I have no idea what you do or what you believe in. I'd like to be like you, I'd like to understand you. But it's impossible. Study, have a future? There's no future. There's only the present. Bye. See you. - Is anyone home? - My grandma, don't sweat it. She stays in her room and won't bother us. That's how it is here. That's my parents' bed, this one's mine. When they're open, it feels like sleeping under the table. Sucks. But I'm not ashamed. There's more shame in having a big apartment. Civil servants have those. Shame on them. Step back a little. You do this every day? I used to sleep in the kitchen. Join me. What's going on here? Nothing. Can I borrow your bicycle tomorrow? Then what would I do? What? Careful! I don't know how you stand it. I have to get drunk every night. Just to bear sleeping next to my parents. Imagine sleeping next to your mother. Hearing her breathing every night. Before my dad got fired, we had a normal place. He didn't know what hit him. Imagine spending ten years studying, and you end up working in a hospital parking lot. Sucks. - Which hospital? - The central one. My dad works there. Really? I suppose he's head of some department, a good communist? Doctors don't have to join the party. Whatever. I'm through studying. It's bullshit. Where to now? I'm going home. Seriously? Fine, go to your sweet home. Hi. I took it from my dad's desk. Wow. Too bad you only wrote one day. You could've written three weeks. What would I do for three weeks? You're lost without a routine. I've skipped school for 6 months and I'm fine. So what's the plan? I need to take care of something, then we'll be free. - Wait for me here. - No, I'm coming with you. Seriously, wait here. What are you doing? I told you to wait inside. You took so long! Did you get any money? I don't change money in the station, only at the hotels. - What do you do here? - What? - What do you do here? - Nothing. Don't worry, it's ok. You're so sure of yourself. You could never do what I do. You don't know me. Should I go? He's not a foreigner. It's obvious. So? They wouldn't buy at 10, so I got 5. They ripped you off. Anyway, it's ok for a first time. We still earned something. - I won't haggle. - Next time, be firm. 10,000 or nothing. Just look at it. So now we're a team. You're the only one I couldn't lie to. Lukas is quitting, I need you right now. Do you have a passport? - Not yet. - You need to get one. Could you get a visa? Maybe a French one, my uncle lives there. But for Germany... It's fine, anywhere in the West will do. Yeah. Yeah? So you'll work with me? It doesn't scare you? You surprised me at the hotel today. It's not that difficult. Right, but you can never be sure in this business. It's like a hospital. It's like they're already dead. I'm on Steponas Street. Which house? I'm here. On the street. What number? Be right there. years later Where are you going? Not staying for dinner? - No. - Is it because of me? No, because of what you did. Jana, what's wrong? Where are you going? Stay. I invited a Polish friend. He studied architecture in Paris. I'm sorry, I didn't realize it mattered to you. We never see you. I'll help you. Want me to come with you to ?elva? No, no need. Really? - You're going to ?elva? - Yeah. There's a lake I'd like to see again. - What's it called? - I don't know. How will you find it? There are many lakes there. No road leads to this one. It's in the middle of the forest. I think I know the one you mean. Really? Will you take her to the lake? I'd love to, if you could. It's not far from the building site. Ok. I'll come pick you up at eight tomorrow morning. If that's not too early for you? No, on the contrary. I'm very happy. I'll be waiting downstairs at eight. You're making that sound? It's asio otus. The long-eared owl. Can you stop? Why, are you scared? Stop, I don't like it. You're good, do you play a lot? I used to, but I'm too busy now. - Studying? - No. What do you do? Same as Tomas, but I'm planning to defect to the West. I could've done that when I was in East Berlin. But I couldn't leave Miroslav and Daniela behind. We wrote "Arkliuk Arkliuk" together. I wouldn't be offended, but I would miss you. I'd only miss one person. But we're leaving together, right? How is it? - Cold! - Cold... She's never cold. Guys, are you coming? Come on! Let's go! Did you know our song "Break of Day" is not about the dawn? It's about light breaking darkness. Illuminating the obscurity! Check this out! Have you heard the new band Makladas? We gotta go back. Everyone out of the water. - We just got in. - I need to take Jana home. Let us relax before the gig. To get to Kaunas by evening, we gotta go. - We gotta go. - We just got in! C'mon, let's go! Miroslav! That's him? Your boyfriend? He makes you do those awful things? Don't feign surprise. I know everything. I went to your school. They showed me the medical certificates you took from my desk. I never thought you could do such a thing. Even forging my signature. What the heck is that? See for yourself. You can't have a car like this. You can't go around in a car like this! How'd you get it? - I have my ways. - Cut the crap, how'd you get it? What's it to you? You're not involved anymore. - But you're dragging Jana into it. - Oh, come on. A snake! It's not dangerous, just a water snake. Just a water snake. It's more afraid of you! Hi! - What's that? - I need to drop it off. I'll take you to the lake and join you later. Wait for me here. Don't be mad. Good afternoon. Are you on vacation? No, why? - Shouldn't you be at school? - I have no classes today. - Could we see your ID? - I don't have it on me. Do you still live at 36 Bugos Street? Yes. - Are you waiting for someone? - No. - How did you get here? - By bus. - Have a nice day, miss. - Goodbye. - Are you coming? - I'm waiting for Paulius. I'll wait with you. - We're off, bye. - See you. Maybe he got arrested. What does he risk? Some go down for not much. Go down? He could get ten years. Trying to scare me? He's the one who needs scaring. Let's go see his parents. They'll know what's up. Come on. Lukas! Good afternoon. - Have you seen Paulius? - No. I rarely see him since he met those musicians. - What musicians? - I don't know. We'll go look for him. - Have a nice day. - Goodbye. So he wasn't arrested. Still, he's been going too far. I think it's the opposite. He wants it all. Like that car. You enjoy the benefits. I don't care about the car, I can take a bus. - I thought you were friends. - We are friends. At first I thought all our schemes were a way of being political. Then I realized it was just trafficking. I can't pretend that's the only reason I quit. I was also afraid, of course. But Paulius... At least he's not afraid. That alone makes him a dissident. Doing nothing is no better. What do you mean? We do nothing. We let others decide for us. I think it's sad he's decided nothing can change. - He didn't decide that. - Despair is a decision. We said it was temporary, but he got into it. I do understand him, though. What do you do all day? Wait for him in the car? I thought you didn't want to know. I'm worried about you both. The less you know, the less you'll worry. Do you really think I don't care? About what? Never mind. Where were you? On a business trip. We were discussing your business. Why, you want back in? No. I gotta go. Off you go. Back to the good side. - What happened at the lake? - The cops came. - Seriously? - Yeah. Did they ask anything? For my ID, why was I there, and with whom. Just a routine check. The usual. I was afraid they were after you. When I came back there were no cops. We shouldn't go there again. Going home? I want to show you something. Hop in. I won't be long. - Hello. - Hi! Hi. Don't mind the dog, it won't bite. His eyes are so sad. He does have a sad face. She's a girl, Mira. I have... Antanas... Jana. Sorry. Antanas. I have a meeting. We're taking over the old Cooperative. Renovating it. - You, how? - Some friends and I, all together. It's going to be great. Come on, they're waiting. Until recently, nobody was interested in such architecture. But you'll see. Soon it will be a historical monument. Historical or not, it's ugly. No, it's functional. I'm fond of such architecture. We'll merge it into a single complex. Most of the buildings are still in great shape. You're looking for a lake? Where is it? Not far, near ?elva. We have quite a few lakes around here. What's it called? What's the name of the lake? Jana never knew the name. There are a lot of lakes. I'm sure you'll find one you like. No. I'm looking for a particular lake. Well, lakes can be nameless. The one behind these houses has no name. A lake is a lake. Have you created a company? Why? We're all friends, we trust each other. It's not about trust, it's about... efficiency. I can see you're skeptical, but we will succeed. Shall we? If you're in a hurry, go right ahead. - Ok Antanas, we'll be going. - Bye. I'll be back soon. The saddest thing is to see people who, in the past, placed their hope in the future, and now, in the future, are placing their hope in the past. Is that aimed at me, too? Partially, yes. If we break up, will you get over me? No. Why do you say that? It's unthinkable. What if I left and you couldn't join me? You'd come back. Wouldn't you? You could just leave your parents and friends? When you want to leave, you leave. You've really changed. Hey. Hello. - The ruble went down again? - As if you care. They ask about you at the station. Send my regards. I'm not sure that'll amuse them. - I don't care. - We know. Leave him alone! He's free to do what he wants. - So am I. - Good for you. Let's take a swim. No thanks. - Want me to come with you? - No need. I'm going with him. We started the day with an argument. So you see? Anything can be worked out. We'll meet here again. So this is it? It's nice! - Why is it so thin? - I don't know. Will I ever have one? Probably. What does this mean? "Valid 30 days." If mine takes longer, I'll work hard until I join you. Wait for me here. I know, I know. You don't seem that keen to leave. I won't have my passport by the time you leave, but I'll drive you to the airport. - Will you join me after? - Of course. It's hard to imagine. You're right. It'll be like a dream. Why a dream? It just popped into my head. Waiting for me? To give you a sermon? No. I'm slowly adjusting to this. You go out at night now. And soon... It's hard to imagine you'll be leaving us one day. You know... It's always like this. - No, it's because I'm about to leave. - But not for long. - But we won't see each other. - If you stay there. Have you considered it? Everyone has. But you'll come back? Let's just go. Not yet. I'm going. But... I wanted to ask you... Could Paulius take me? Where? To the airport. Yes, yes. His name is Paulius? What if I can't come join you? This could be the last time we see each other. Let's go to my place, wait for my passport and leave together. And my parents? They'll think you're in France. They don't need to know. We can sleep here, my grandma is away. We'd have been at the airport right now. You going through security. Maybe we never would've seen each other again. I'm so glad you're here. Me too. Jana will stay with us a few days. I understand why he doesn't want to spend time with us. But why is he leaving you alone? Maybe you know where he is now? He's working with his musicians friends. What is he doing? - Driving them around. - Where? To other cities, like Kaunas. Why does he drive him to other cities? They have concerts. I never ask him any questions. I trust him. I think it's better this way. Right? Of course. We got by. You know how it was. He changed money illegally. - And you were ok with it? - Yes. I did it too. In the past, I did business with some of those crooks too. I never liked them much. Did you know he was in prison when you left? He wasn't yet. The cruel irony of history. Soon afterwards, everything changed. It's this way. I knew it. You couldn't have known my lake. It's hidden in the middle of a forest. Here anyone can come, anyone can find it. Impossible to hide. - Impossible to hide? - Yes. We wanted to hide there. You drank it all. Congratulations. Are you going back to Poland? Not right away. No one's waiting for you? We're both alone in... Where are we? Giedraiciai. Maybe you should stop drinking. You'll be drunk, and I wouldn't like... I'm never drunk. I'm used to drinking. So what can I do for you? Lukas could tell me. Lukas? Yes, Lukas. Who's Lukas? My friend. Our friend. We were always together. I see. And? What about Lukas? I know. I know where he lives. I've known from the start. The whole time I've been gone. I always knew where he lived. I understand. Can you believe that this whole time, I've never gone to see him? I could. I could have. All I'd have to do is ring his doorbell. He has a nice door. I walk by it every time. Every time... And so? I never ring the doorbell. Why don't you? Because behind the door is Lukas. And Lukas... And Lukas? And Lukas knows. Obviously. He knows everything. And he'll tell me. What? Are you dumb or what? Yes. Just... what would Lukas tell you? What happened. Why? Why what? Why don't you do it? Because I'm too afraid. Do you understand? Sure. Because maybe he'd say to me, "You piece of shit, why did you leave? "Why'd you drop him? Why didn't you come back?" Right. Why? "Because you're a bad person. "You're selfish. You only ever think of yourself. "Paulius and I... "You tricked us into thinking you were a good girl. "A nice girl. "A kind, sweet girl." I understand you. You're right. He's right. I feel the same way he does. You too? Obviously. It's true. What? What you and Lukas said. This light... really becomes you. What? What? No, it's... really bizarre, because... Where are we going? He's the greatest poet... from Poland, and he wrote... the greatest poem of his life... he wrote it in Paris. It starts in Lithuania. Let's go... Let's go... One step... Hang on, where's the car? This way, I think. Good afternoon. I'm Jana's father. I need to talk to your son. He was supposed to drive her to the airport. But she didn't take the flight. She didn't, I'm sure about that. Yesterday a friend of mine saw her. You and Paulius have forced me to lie. What are you plotting? You must return to your parents. It's too late. At least call them, reassure them. What can I tell them? You can't stay here anymore. What happened, why are you crying? Don't listen to my mother, it's not her business. I have a plan to leave. I found someone to get the documents. I want this all to end. Good afternoon, Jana. Did you come here with Paulius Vargalys? No. We know Paulius is unemployed. Do you know what he does? No. Where is he now? I don't know. Do your parents know you're staying in a hotel? No. How can you and Paulius be unemployed, yet have enough money to pay for a room here? In a situation like this, we should take you to your parents. You're a minor. But we'll look the other way. If you help us, we'll help you. Think it over. We'll be back. Goodbye. We used to go there often, but now nobody goes. We'll be all on our own. No need to be afraid, no one will bother us. It's the most beautiful place, with a lake nobody knows about. There's no path to it. I never thought I'd go back there. But now, with all this going on... We're so lucky. I only wish we could stay longer. - Is it a big lake? - Very. You can't see where it ends. That big? Maybe not. When I came with my parents, this was my room. Can you imagine if we were just here? Just here? Yeah, if we'd just come here without worrying about the cops. Do you see any cops? There's only spiders and bats here. Always have been. Come, I'll show you the best part. Wait for me. Are you sure this is the way? Why are you worried? Probably just an animal. We could spend summer here. Do you think they'd find us? In the middle of a forest? I doubt it. This is Walden. The lake? That's what my uncle called it. I don't know why. I recognize it. This is the house. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Are you looking for someone? No. We're looking for a lake. Can I help you? Jakub. No, it's too dangerous. Beautiful. This is the lake. What's the name of this lake? Walden. No. It's called Kamuzele. Strange. I remember it differently. Nothing has changed. What do we do now? We need to go. We can't stay here. We must go. Shall we? I can't keep putting you through this. Seriously, enough now. None of this is your fault. I have to deal with my problems myself. I'm scared. Me too. I may have a good idea. I brought you... - Poems? - Yes. It's the poem... I don't know if you remember, I told you about it once. - When? - On the path. - Oh right, that night! - That night. There's a lot of sex, a lot of... Where? Oh, after! Hidden in the middle. Of course. So maybe we should start... Shall we start at the beginning? Wherever you like. Let's start there. "Oh my Lithuania, as it is with health, "to lose you is to know your beauty...
