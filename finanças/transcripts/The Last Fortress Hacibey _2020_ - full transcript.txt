Why did you freeze on the spot? Look… What? This is my chalice. So, what? You'll board a ship and get to him. Show him this chalice. And tell him that I sent you. Why do I need it? Back in the day, Sirko handed this chalice over to me. He got it from Bohdan Khmelnytsky. And Bohdan got it from the Marshal of France Charles de Castelmore, d'Artagnan. It saved his life, and it will save yours. So, don't argue. So, don't argue. Well, give him this wine, too. It's from all of our brethren. Thank you, uncle Tymosh. Well? Are you going? I am. How exactly will it save my life? You'll see. At that time, my friend Yoram had no idea that for five centuries a fortress had been standing guard on the Black sea shore. The Lithuanians called it Khadjibey, the Italians called it Genesta. The Genovese portulans clearly indicate the way to find it. When in my time, the Russian empire started its military attack on my country, the famous fortress owned by the Ottomans happened to be at the frontier near the Dniester and Danube, where the glorious Transdanubian Cossacks who were holding the hand of the Ottoman sultan had been keeping watch. Andriy, listen to me carefully. We are surrounded by the Russian troops. Nobody will get out or get in here, over the Danube. Try to reach the Khadjibey fortress. You'll find the commandant there and hand this letter missive over to him. What's in it? Andriy, you're like a son to me. But you are our best warrior, as well. That's why I entrust this important task to you. I know you can handle it. That's a great honor for me. Don't interrupt me. Wait. You know that we lost some troops. And the sultan is sad because of those who died in the Caucasus. God rest their souls. It all happened because the high vizier is a traitor. The vizier is a traitor? Yes, we've intercepted his letter to Potiomkin that proves everything. The vizier conveys information to the enemy. As a result, the sultan keeps all of his troops in the Caucasus, but this is a deceiving maneuver so that the Russians could begin their attack in Bessarabia. It's impossible. The commandant is my friend. Besides, he's got connections in Istanbul and special influence on the sultan. If he delivers the information to the sultan, we can endure. I get it, Mr. Otaman. Now, I'll write where we got this letter missive. But it shouldn't fall into the wrong hands. … Hide it in a safe place. Here you go. I wrote to the commandant that you would hand him this costly scimitar. He gave it to me once. This way, he'll believe that you are my messenger. Take it. Well, now hurry up. God speed you! Guys, Andrii is going to hit the road! God willing, we'll hold out and then go back to Zaporizhia. THE KHAJIBEY FORTRESS Rather! Faster! .. Run! .. Hurry up! .. Faster here! Run-run! Fatima, my dear daughter. As you can see, it's hard times for us. I had lived a glorious life. But you must grow higher and higher as a grape-vine. And remember that your roots are in this soil. But can't anyone help us? Nobody will save us? There's no wind for the fleet. We lost a lot of men in the Caucasus. The Muscovites somehow know things about us, and they continue to attack. There's my old enemy standing at the Khadjibey walls. General Morozov? Is he still alive? He's here now, and he wants to take revenge on me for not giving him you and the wealth of our family. Whatever happens, I'll be with you at Khadjibey, father. No, you must live, because you're my only daughter and memory of my late wife. May Allah protect her soul. Father, I will do whatever you command. Remember the vineyard between the Dniester and the Danube? Yes, I do. I was always comfortable there. Nobody knows about this place. That's where you will go. In Danylo's tavern by the sea, you will take a horse and supplies. This is the key to the secret door that will take you to the beach. I don't know how to live without you, father. My sons, your brothers, died in battle. That's the only reason I taught you to wield a sword and shoot. I taught you sciences, languages, geography, mathematics, and medicine. You are the last of our kind. I ask you to make our descendants live on this earth, no matter what happens. What's in it? These are men's clothes and a sword. So no one will guess that you are a girl. Kemal will guide you. And now, go. Now I must be here, with my warriors. Only the Almighty knows what will happen next. Promise me that you will stay alive and our line will continue. I promise, father. Go. A year ago. You are in my hands now. But I offer you to resolve the issue in a noble way. Your conditions? I offer you a fight to the first wound. If I win, I'll cut your ear off. I agree. Take care of your ear. The first column goes to the left! Infantry Battalion on the right! Take this dog, the commandant, alive. Do it. You came at last, my poor child. Such bad things are happening in the world. Damn war. My father told me that from you, I can take… No more words. I know you need a horse and supplies. Katria. Bring out the horse for Fatima and add the supplies I prepared for the evening. I will, father. I need to change. Oh, yes, of course. Go to the room, and I'll take care of the horse. The old dog, the commandant, if he's still alive, he won't say anything. Where his money is and what their military plans are. Anyway, I know how to get him talking. Where is this dog, the commandant?! Alive? Finally, we met. Ahmet Pasha. I have only two questions for you. Which one of your ears would you prefer to be cut off? And where is Fatima, your daughter? Let me die as a warrior. You will die. But first, you'll tell me everything. Write a recommendation. Report to Suvorov that Khadjibey is ours. Take the pasha to the casemate. And send surveyors to the steppe. Find the girl, this dog's daughter. Hello, beauty. Ivan, we get the horse, and you get the pasha's daughter. What if she's not the pasha's daughter? I'm telling you, it's her, for sure. Now, that's great. Everyone is looking for her, and we got her. We'll divide the spoils later. Come here, baby. Why do you wear men's pants? "Who are you? Exactly. Pasha's daughter!" It's war again. The road again. The fog is so dense that I can't see anything. How do you find your way, my friend, eh? I'm so sick of it all… No wife, no home, no happiness. How does that song go, do you remember, Orlyk? 'I had a sword, a rifle, and a charming girl. "The rifle broke, and the girl abandoned me." Stop. Hey, anyone! Help me! Please help! Help me! Please help! Do you want to tell me something, little horse? What? Come, come. To me. Good boy. That's right. What a smart horse you are. Good boy. You love your master so much. Who are you? Where did you get this scimitar? Where is my horse? Where am I, anyway? Why the hell did you tie me up? Well? Don't mention hell in a house. Answer me. Give me some water. What a good job I'm doing, right? I don't know where I am, and there's some Turkish girl... Who are you, anyway? Why do you speak our language? Although I am a Turkish girl and the daughter the daughter of my father. But my mom is from Poltava. Where are we now? By the way, where are my things? We're in a safe place. When you feel better, you can go wherever you want. But first, you'll tell me where you got this scimitar. Well? My chieftain gave it to me. Why? I have an important mission. You? Yes! I need to get to the Khadjibey. Untie me! Why the hell do you care about that scimitar? I am the daughter of Ahmet Pasha, the commandant of the Khadjibey fortress. Yeah, right, and I'm the Sultan's son. I'm not kidding. Well, I can't tell you, I have an important assignment. A letter. Can you let me read it? No, I have to go to Khadjibey and hand it over to Pasha, personally. You can't meet him. The Muscovites seized Khadjibey yesterday. So? Where's the letter? In a safe place with me. You won't get it. Untie me. As if! What if it says that you are a traitor? Where did you hide it? Where?! Your guess is right. If you need it, you can get it. Well? Just be careful with the gun, please. What am I supposed to do with it now? This letter must be handed over to Ahmet Pasha. For him to hand it to the Sultan. Will you untie me? Tell me, Ahmet-bei, do you look back to the old times too? Why are you silent? The whole land is in our hands. Suvorov comes from the north. Potiomkin attacks from the west. Your fortresses are on fire. People are dying. I'm trying to pray. But you don't need it anymore. Allah has turned away from you. I'm the only one who can save you. You know nothing about the holy Maker… It was not the Maker. It was me who saved your life. Do I have to do something? I even know what. So you could tell me where your daughter Fatima is. You can't get to her. You will tell me where she is. You laughed at me earlier, too. You were sure that I would not get you. But now you are in my hands. You are silent. You will tell me everything. What are you hoping for? The Transdanubian Cossacks are squeezed to the river. We are also winning in the Caucasus. And also, you deprived me of my ear once. So, there you go. Although, no. I will spread the rumor that you are in my prison. And I will wait for Fatima to come after you. And then I'll cut off your ear in front of her. Take him to the dungeon. What's wrong? Nothing. You can get out of here. Well, don't cry, you. Come on. I'm not crying. Okay, I just thought so. By the way, you look better in a woman's dress than in men's pants. We need to leave fast and take some food with us to eat on the road. Maybe you can cook something? What's your name? My name is Fatima. And what's yours? Andriy. Well, Andriy. My father did not raise me as a maid. You can cook for yourself. A Cossack is not a nanny. If you say so. I'll go down to the cellar. Maybe I can find something. You can get out. How are you, Orlyk? She can't even cook some porridge, can you imagine that? … Has your mother ever taught you anything at all, eh? My mom died when I was twelve. I'm sorry, I... I didn't mean to hurt you. I'll cook something, okay? I will not eat Cossack soup. Who said anything about the soup? I'll cook some Turkish dish. Perhaps you can teach me how to plow? If it's necessary, I can teach you even greater things. Where is your vineyard? What do you see here? The harvest is ripe. You'll have enough food when I leave. Are you going to leave me? Yeah. You can't leave me. I have to find Ahmet Pasha, it's urgent. We don't know what happened to my father. If he's alive, we need a ship. Where can we get one? We need to find out what happened to your father And we can either buy or steal a ship. I'll find out where to buy it. I have money, and I also need to go home. To Istanbul. Wait, so, you need to go to Istanbul. There, you could meet the Sultan. Yeah. The letter must be handed over to the sultan, together with you and your father. How will we get to the seaside? There are surveyors in the steppe. The guard. I thought about it too. But we need to know what happened to Ahmet Pasha. And find a ship. Well, what else have you got? I also have a chalice for wine. Show me. Okay. … Let's do it again. Okay. … Let's do it again. I don't mind. … I think that's enough. I think we should play once again. Drop your ax. Take him away, let him cool off. Everybody, get to work! Well, you are lucky today. If in my life I were always as lucky as in the game, I would have long had my own vineyard by now. There has been no wind for three days. That's why the team goes crazy. And how long will it be like this? What, so eager to get ashore? They say one can get some land, explore the region. I can even understand the local language with a dictionary. Not exactly Don't forget that we are not going in peacetime. There is a war. And no one knows how it will end. Who wins, the Russian Empire or the Ottoman Empire. Thank you, Captain, but I have more than one goal. I carry what is more expensive than gold. What do you think? We need to know what happened to Ahmet Pasha. Are there any loyal people still left near Khadjibey? There is a man. The tavern owner, Mr. Danylo. He owns a tavern, can we really trust him? Yes. We can. He respected my father. And my father did a lot for him. Where is his tavern? Is it far from the fortress? By the sea. Near Khadjibey. If it's by the sea, then we'll find a ship there. What good would it do if we starved to death, okay? Your father will see you and ask me, "Why did you make my daughter starve, Cossack, eh?" Dying is not about me. I forbid you to die, as well. Your husband will be having a lot of fun in his life. He will have the best life with a girl like me. But it's none of your business, Cossack. Well, well. You still think this is the right decision. I had two options, either to stay in France or to come here. I was advised to board your ship. Did someone invite you? Do you have people you know? A relative of someone I know has a tavern here. Mr. Danylo. Do you happen to know where it is? What pilot does not know Mr. Danylo's tavern? Here it is. Thank you. See you, Captain. When are you going back? When the wind rises. Guys! Put it here. Shall we drink? Danylo, you always know when we're coming. Were you waiting for us? Pour us some drinks. Well, of course, if you have money to pay with. Today, our drinks are on him. Good afternoon, Mr. Danylo. Hello. Where are you from? My name is Yoram, my friend Tymosh says hello and sends you this chalice. The Lord gave me the news of my brother. Our chalice. Oh, what a guest. What a guest. Some wine? It would be great. The guys say their drinks are on you, right? Yes, I won some money. Why don't I treat the guys to your wine as well? I'll also pay for everyone today. The drinks are on me, too! What a guest. So you are a wine connoisseur. It seems that my face says so, right? It's not only your face. Only a great wine connoisseur can bring a vine in a pot. It's not just some vine. It's vine from France. Here, taste the wine made of it. What a taste... The last time I drank it, I was the same age as you. I don't think my brother's friend came back to us for no reason at all. I want to grow such a vine here. To stop bringing wine from across the sea and make it here. Uncle Danylo, I really need your help. I heard that they give out some land here and... Let's talk about it later. Katria! Katria, bring some meat, cheese, everything we have for our dear guest. My daughter. Musicians! Please play. Now, I want to tell you what's happening in the fortress and the region. I'm listening. It's better not to tell anyone about your plans here. Why is that? What happened? The new authorities set new laws. Today, the owner of the land has to take money from anyone who wants some land. This is the last thing I need. What am I going to do now? Whom should I see about it? Let's think about it in the morning. Your room is ready, you can go to sleep peacefully. And I'll call it a day. No, Danylo, you can't call it a day, not yet. You probably know who I am? Um… I certainly do. Such a glorious, such... a... such a noble gentleman. Pour me some wine. I want to know something. You are a merchant, Danylo. You've got a tavern and a daughter. God's gifts, I'm grateful to Him. I don't have time for long talks. Those who work here must pay me. Take Ahmet Pasha, for example. He didn't want to obey and now he is locked in the fortress. Soon, we will execute him. So what? Will you pay me? Or… You have a beautiful daughter. She will live with me for a while. I will pay everything. Excuse me, gentlemen! Is it really nice to treat a girl like that? Huh?! What is happening here, anyway? It's not your business. I guess it's not. But to hurt a girl… It's not good. What have you done?! Why did you do that?! … This is a vine. You need to be more careful with it. What did they do to you... What will happen to the tavern now? Uncle Danylo, he is a criminal, he should be tied up or killed. What do you mean, to kill? A rope. Where's a rope? Here's the rope. Damned rope. Okay, you need to get out of here. I think I know where to send you. Where? Take your things and go to the vineyard, quickly. And take Yoram with you. Well, where are they? I don't know where they went. They took their things and left my house. I wanted to treat you to wine, and this madman started a fight. Take him to the dungeon. Burn everything to the ground. Who is it? It's me, Katria! Did anything happen? Who is this? Morozov attacked us. He's looking for you. And this is Yoram, he came to see us, but I don't know if it's a timely visit. Where is your father? He stayed in the tavern to save me. Have you heard anything about my father? He's alive, I heard he's a prisoner in the fortress. But they are going to execute him. Well, at least, he is alive. How? When? I don't know. But they are going to execute him for sure. We must release him. I will not let your father die. Promise? You have my Cossack's word. One can't even pray in here. I think you won't have to. Ahmet Pasha? You're here, too! The Almighty left me alive. So, there is a matter that I have not finished yet. Ben biliyorum (I know) what exactly. What can you possibly know? I know that Morozov is looking for Fatima, and he burned down my tavern. For what? Because my guest, Yoram, who was in the tavern at the moment, stood up for me and almost killed his people. How is my daughter doing? When did you see her? I hope she's on the farm. She's alive, she's alive. I sent my daughter to the same place where Fatima is. Together with the Yoram. My dear daughter, Fatima. My joy. Mr. Danylo, we don't want to die here. By no means, I swear. I suggest then that we run away. How? I don't know yet. We need a plan. The plan is simple. What? We need to get into the fortress and, whatever happens, get Ahmet Pasha and Katia's father out of prison. This is clear. But how? There are few of us, and it's a fortress. Soldiers, army. Will you go alone? Do you really think you can defeat them alone? No. With you. Well, yes. If there's two of us, then of course. Yes, the two of you against the army. Good plan. By the way, yesterday, he defeated a whole gang in the tavern alone. Oh, I have no doubt about that! Okay, let's stop arguing, shall we? I'm not going. Katria, as well. And you can do it, Cossack. Where did you come from, anyway? And what's with the vine that you have? I traveled a lot around the world. I was looking for such a rare vine from which the world's best grapes would grow. Now I want to plant it here. Now I even know how to thank you. If you help us… Come on, I'll show you the vineyard. Katria, will you help us understand each other? Let's go. So, what brought you here to this blessed land? Do you like it? If you go with us tomorrow, the vineyard will be yours. What do you think? My father would have cursed me for helping the Turks. He fought with them all his life. How was it? Successful? Don't ask. So, we have a deal, then? I'm with you. I already have an interest here without a vineyard. Close it. Stop, you beast, stop. Who are you? We're salesmen, Mr. Guard. Why is that one silent? He's mute. My brother, Mykola. Say something, Mykola. There, you see? Mute. What are you carrying? Well, it's wine, grapes, to the market. Did you know that from now on, one third must be given to the treasury? Well, of course. Mr. Guard. How is it? Good wine? Yes, taste it. Oh, the wine is good. Earlier, we could buy it in the tavern. And now? Well, now… The tavern was burned, the owner is in the tower. Which one? The one where Ahmet Pasha was bagged into. … Open up! Come more often! Mute? I told him the first thing that came to my mind. So, this way you could bring anything? I know the Moscow army. Give them a bottle, and you are free to carry a cannon or whatever. Well? Come on, Napoleon. The main thing to remember. Two soldiers are always at the entrance. One is in the guard booth. And this one is the chief of the guard. At twelve pm the chief drinks milk. It sits under his chair. Oh no, it's not milk, it's vodka. And here is our friend, going to the steppe for the trainings, to check the posts. Yes, the chief of the guard is already tipsy. I wonder if he goes like that every day. I wish he did it every day! Damn him! Today and tomorrow he's definitely leaving! That's what I thought. When Morozov leaves, everyone is more lazy. At twelve pm there will be the changing of guard at the cannons. So, what's next? Where's the entrance to the tower? So, when there are no superiors in the fortress, we can throw a grenade into the sentry box and start. Hey, wait, are you saying we're going to attack them, just the two of us? Calm down, you still haven't understood anything. Of course, we will not storm the fortress. We just need to get Ahmet Pasha and Katria's father out of prison. Well, how do we get them out of the dungeon? We will blow up the tower door. Or the whole tower. And the soldiers? The explosion must destroy the barracks. We'll have five minutes till the other soldiers come up. We'll quickly find Ahmet Pasha, Katria's father, and retreat. Where? To the steppe? They'll catch us at once. We'll not retreat to the steppe, but to the ship that will be waiting for us near the fortress to take Ahmet Pasha to Istanbul. You forgot that Turkish ships no longer sail here. Unless you know where to find a ship. That's exactly what I wanted to ask you. How did you get here, Yoram? On a ship. Her captain is a Danube pilot. So maybe we can find this pilot and offer him a fun trip to Istanbul? Yes, but for him, it's risky. He might lose the schooner. Never mind that. We can buy this schooner from the captain. Well, we can make a deal with the ship. But how will we get out of the fortress and board the ship? I know a secret way. It will take us to the sea. It's close. Near the fortress. Good. So, tomorrow, we'll pay the captain a visit? Well, he will ask us what we have in mind, of course. Tell me what you have in mind. The main thing here is not to drag it out, but to say at once what we want. Mr. Pilot, we are going to charter your sea bird and send a passenger to Istanbul. It's Ahmet Pasha. Of course, everyone in the city and in the port knows that Ahmet Pasha is in the dungeon, so the captain will definitely ask... Ahmet Pasha, you say? You think it's possible. Otherwise, I don't get your plan at all. Well, it will be just a kidnapping. Nothing grand. Not even... not even a fight. Ha. You mean that you want to get into the fortress. There, you'll get the Pasha out of jail and sail with the wind to Istanbul? Exactly! You're out of your mind. What if your plan fails? My "chaika" can be easily sunk by cannons from the shore! Where will I get a new boat? Is it enough? To buy a new ship. And now, the most important part. Anything else? We need a big bang to blow up the tower and the barracks and leave Khadjibey. And who's going to blow the tower up? You? I'd love to, but I know nothing about it. Me too. Who's heard of the old Haiduck? He lives nearby. Who is he? He is a legend. My father granted him his life once. When he blew up the janissary barracks. He lives here, nearby. And everyone is afraid of him. He first shoots and then finds out who came to see him. He definitely can blow up the tower. Warchief Angel, Warchief Angel! Warchief Angel! Are you here?! I'll go alone. … Hello, anybody home? … Oh, wow, what a… Put the sword where you took it. Put it down, put it down. Hands up. Both of you! Mr. Warchief, we came with good intentions. What are you saying? I don't understand. Maybe you're praying already, eh? It's worth it. Warchief Angel, I'm Ahmet Pasha's daughter. Speak louder, I can't hear you. I am the daughter of Ahmet Pasha! Ahmet Pasha's daughter? Well. Let's talk, then. … As you know, I don't like Turks very much. I'm sorry, Fatima. But I don't like Morozov even more. Why is that? Ahmet Pasha was the real warrior and master here. He did construction works in the city, he planted vines, and anyway, I owe him, so I respected him. Thank you. So what? Will you help us? Fine. I'll go with you. There is one place in the fortress. I'll put up a barrel of gunpowder there. And I'll blow up the passage at the entrance to the dungeon. Okay. Well, to success? To success. I'd agree to give my soul to the devil just to get out of here and throw a noose around Morozov's neck. What's next? I find my daughter and go by sea to Istanbul. I used to own some ships, too. One was in Greece, the second sailed to France, the third one in Spain and the fourth sailed to England. Mr. Danylo, you are a rich man. Ships are just wooden boards, and sailors are just people. A daughter is the greatest wealth. Yes, you are right. Money can't be better than a daughter. Would I like my daughter to fall dead at my feet, with shiny diamonds in her ears? No news about her. There is no worse misfortune on earth than what has fallen on our shoulders. I understand you so well, Mr. Danylo. If we're not executed, we will reunite with our children. Can't sleep? No. Tell me something. Do you often think about your father? Yes, I do. When I was little, my father used to take me to the steppe. I was afraid, and he laughed and joked. "Look, Fatima, you will grow up and you won't be afraid." And I was no longer afraid. I don't remember neither my father nor my mother. How is that? The Transdanubian Cossacks grow up in the army. Well, like your janissaries. Maybe that's why we are so cruel. And rarely does anyone manage to get married, have a home, a family. But it's so important. I want to give you something. This is my father's ring. I want you to have it as a keepsake from me. My father would turn in his grave if he knew that I was helping the Turks. But he would be happy for us having a new house. And I can take you to Paris, to the wine fair. Water it more carefully. I always dreamed of having my own vineyard. Promise me. What? Promise me you'll stay alive. And we'll come back here together. I promise. Come on. Are you sure now that everything will work out? I hope so. It's bad that there are so few of us. But Izmail and our Cossacks are holding on and the ataman is waiting. Yes, I... I remember that... There will be three of us in the fortress. Me and Yoram and Warchief Angel. No, four of us. Who's the fourth? Me. No. Yes. Okay. Katia! I will be waiting with the horses at the exit to the sea. Agreed. Well, it's time, then? Oh! Old acquaintances. Hello, Mr. Guard. Who's this? This is our father. Oh, is he mute, too? No, he's talkative. Why is your father so brave, huh? Remember about one third? Well, of course, Mr. Guard. Open up! You can go. Hyah! And what's next? Now according to our plan. Everything is on schedule. The guard goes down. Two soldiers stand at the entrance, one in the guard booth. This is the chief of the guard. At exactly twelve pm, the chief drinks vodka, which sits under his chair. Okay, it's not vodka today. What happened here, huh? Son, are you literate? I am. My son went missing during the war, so I want to write him a letter. Okay. What should I write? "Dear son. … Good afternoon. Your mother is writing you a letter." I am alive and well, waiting for you". Well? Did you write it? I did, mother, I did. … Okay, that's it, let's go. Wait. Why did you freeze on the spot? This is my chalice. So, what? Mr. General. Mr. General. Mr. General, I... What do you want? I... I couldn't wait to see you. My son went missing two years ago, during the war. So, I wrote a letter, here it is. I was waiting for you to pass it over to him. Old woman, are you out of your mind? Where do you think I will find him? Granny, please go away. Move. Please give it to him. I'm begging you. She's begging… Ah, what a folk… Granny, go where you went. It will start now. Ahmet Pasha, we came for you. Who are you? Father! Fatima! I am a Cossack from over the Danube, I have a mission for you from our chieftain, but now is not the time to explain. We need to run. Let's go! Go get them! Take them alive! Hoist the boat out! Move it! Father, it's you! Oh, this day has truly become a holiday. Ladies and gentlemen, we have no time. Let's move to the ship. The Otaman sends his regards. You have to leave as soon as possible, the soldiers will be here soon. To Istanbul? Everything as we agreed. Yoram, Katria and Mr. Danylo will move to the vineyards. The captain will take Ahmet Pasha to Istanbul, and I will stay here, on our land. This is a letter from our Otaman. The Sultan must read it. Consider your mission complete. Let's go. Honey, we're going. I will stay here, Father. With him? I will stay with Andriy. Do you remember? It was you who told me that my roots were here. You are my sunshine. I'm leaving you here, on this land. You are with a great warrior. I'll see you later for sure, Cossack. Farewell, Ahmet Pasha. Shall we go now? The wind has come already! Shall we? Let's go! Come on, pull the boat! The wind is rising! Hoist it! The only thing left to say is that the sultan did receive the letter. Fatima and I got married, and Katria and Yoram did the same thing. A city was founded where Khadjibey once stood, and the Transdanubian Sich existed until the middle of the nineteenth century. Today, villages with the descendants of the Cossacks are still on the maps.
