Um... hoping that we can have a very clear and honest conversation. Be honest, once you went in there you saw a criminal. You didn't see a little girl. You didn't see this, you know, own it. But we'll see how open and honest he's ready to be and where he looks at what's next? You represent a system and what it--what needs to be changed in that system from his perspective? It, it's just, woo, it's a lot. It's a lot. ♪ Okay, there's an elephant in the room. Be very clear, when this went down was I like, oh, there's a grown man who just assaulted a child? Yes, I did. For a girl who wouldn't get out of her chair. -Right, right. -That's a child. Oh my God, this is a little girl. Is there any other way that this could've gone down? This is like just insane. And I still can't understand why it hasn't been like, "Shakara, I apologize. It should a looked different." There hasn't been an apology. I think she is owed one. Okay. You're critical of--of the situation and critical of me. I think that's fine. I was acting as a uniformed police officer, obviously, I was terminated for the incident for the use of force because the sheriff felt like it was improper. Okay? Uh, but certainly it wasn't, you know, it wasn't an assault in any way, shape, or form. You know, I was a political victim in this situation, meaning I was cut loose because politically it made sense. If I follow policy and procedure and I follow the law, there's nothing more I can do because that's my responsibility, that's the oath that I took. Uh, I just, I continue to, on a law enforcement level, I stand by what I did that day. So you said you came in and from the eyes of a police officer it didn't have to go that far, but if I'm looking at a criminal and not a child, yeah, it can go that far. Because I read the reports. The class wasn't really interrupted until this teacher got upset that she wouldn't leave. Why not remove the other kids and handle her? Because you've said you've known her before so it was some deeper stuff. So there could have been a like, "Shakara, what is it that's making you not want to leave?" Well, there's certainly-- and there's people close to me that feel the same way you do about that situation when you talk about classroom management and things like that. So it's not the first time I've heard that and that's fair. If I went to--If I was patrol and I got called to a movie theater to remove somebody from the movie theater, I wouldn't ask the movie theater to leave. Or I went to a restaurant and needed to remove somebody from a restaurant, I wouldn't ask the restaurant to leave, right? And so I viewed it from a police standpoint. And that's, that's where we keep going back to the system that created this to happen. You haven't been my focus. The system has been my focus. I don't believe police should be in schools. There's no reason that you should've been called in period. -All right, I got you. -Yeah. So let me, let me say a couple things. One is I would say, obviously, you know, we know that SROs in a school doesn't mean safety. I don't disagree with that. One of the biggest issues for me right now is they're sticking SROs in schools who aren't even trained properly, but you've got to move the goal post back a little bit. It's okay to discipline kids. It's okay to hold kids accountable. I'm not saying kids don't get to be held accountable. All we're saying is like, what does that accountability look like? We should not have a law where kids are being arrested for things that they can't get arrested outside on the streets for. Look at the system. What system are you referring to? You say the system, we need to change the system. Uh, help me understand that a little bit. So when I say system I'm talking about governmental, education, institutionalized racism, all the policies that we create, all the laws that we create, that's what I mean about the system. Okay, so, you know, you know, uh, the systematic racism and all this kind of stuff, I think it's talking points. I think it sounds really good on its face, but it's one of those things where we're taking the onus again off the kids and saying, "Hey, you're not responsible for your bad behavior, what we're going to do is we're going to blame it on the system." And one of the things that, you know, we looked at with the disturbing school law, it was brought up a lot, was a disproportional amount of Black kids were arrested to white kids, right? And a disproportional amount of Black kids were suspended to white kids, I mean, as you look at it as a whole, I mean, you go to any school district and that's going to be the case. Okay. Why is that happening in your opinion? There is a tendency to think that Black kids are automatically at fault. This one was running the hallways and this one was running the hallways, yet this one got the discipline referral and this one was like, "Well, you know you can't do that." It's something going on. There is a way that we're with young people depending on if they're white versus children of color. And that's been statistically proven. In these schools where the, um, where it was disproportional they also have Black deputies. How do you explain that? Are these, Black deputies and these Black teachers, are they part of the system that's hurting, um, Black people? Absolutely, then we talk about internalized oppression. So if I see that I've been trained all my life that this is better than this, I push that same narrative and I act in accordance to, SO yes. We can go all day on the problems. I don't--I can't talk about problems too much because we already know they're there. My focus is, how do we create solutions? How do we create solutions? And we keep talking about holding kids accountable, but we get to hold adults accountable too, because we're responsible for the next generation. -We really are. -Right. I think that's good. I think that, going back to something, I think you made a great point. I think classroom management... ♪ Lot to process. It's a internal battle I'm having with myself as I move forward and ask, am I doing stuff right? Am I harming? Am |--How do I sit and have a conversation with a man who's created harm to somebody I love. It's not going to make sense to everybody, especially since half the time it don't make sense to me. Do I feel like there's a piece of him that can still be worked with? If I, if my womb spirit had told me, "No, it's not there" I would've like left it alone, but I saw that you're a man willing to step into something new. You're a man still grappling because you've only going with all you knew and part of it is your white privilege. So you think you did nothing wrong because white privilege taught you that. But if you want to be in a room with kids, I do believe it's my responsibility to make sure like, "Oh, I'm not going to let you just go there without going through these things." If those conversations aren't had, then where do we go from there? Because if I throw him aside, I don't know what other room you're going to walk into, right? So sitting with it a lot. Just sitting. ♪ I think I connect with a lot of different communities well and I think it's because of the way I was raised. In the home I grew up in it was never about anybody's race. It was about people are valuable. That's it. Nothing else matters. Growing up I loved going down into the project areas and being the only white boy. There was something to that because you were scared, but at the same time you were like, "Hey, this is what it is, right?" And either you had to be able to ball or you're out. You know what I'm saying? And you had to prove it. You couldn't just walk in there. You had to prove it. Let me see here. I was kind of a hot dog so I was running my mouth. I had no chill to me, I was just like-- I would say things to the crowd and things like that. So yeah, they would give it back to me. Yeah, they would say stuff about my birthmark and my face and things like that. You know, I'm on the court and, oh yeah, they would go after me. "Nice face. Did someone punch you?" Um, stuff like that. The birthmark is one of the things that made me a good cop even, I could sympathize with victims and try to put myself in their shoes, how they felt. That's me right there. We all have these perceptions sometimes of ourselves without any real reality that, hey, this person's treating me in a certain way because we're Black or they're treating me in a certain way because I have a birthmark on my face or because I look different than them, but is that reality? My situation was only about race narrative driven when it was never remotely about race at all. The idea that somehow it becomes a racial thing based on nothing but just the visual of the arrest is just insane to me. With no other facts that matter, it is a five second video, and we're gonna dub this guy racist, we're going to dub law enforcement racist, we're going to dub the system racist, is dangerous to me. ♪ The most dangerous individual who utilizes implicit biases unknowingly are the ones who don't believe that they have them. They say that they don't have implicit biases because they have one or two Black friends. I've even had one officer tell me, "I know I have implicit biases, but I don't want to be reminded of them." I'll never forget that. Everyone has them, you know, uh, and unfortunately we want to uh, ignore them, you know. And often times that may come out in how you use your discretion. This job calls for us to be human first. You can't have this job and intentionally ignore your own implicit biases. ♪ This is Shauna Bell here, the way we know each other, we used to work together at Spring Valley, um, eight years ago, somewhere in that range. I was there for four years. I was there two years before Ben got there and then two years-- Or my last two years was when he was there. When did we date 20097 Yeah, we dated from 2009 to 2011, -somewhere in that range there. -A friend of mine actually called me to tell me that, um... She was like, you know, "Turn on the TV and turn to CNN." Um, and so it's shocking to see someone that you know plastered all over TV and being talked about in a way that you know isn't true, so my heart went out to him, um, because I know that Ben is not what he was portrayed as. I know that it was a lot of people who were making comments about how it should've been handled and I feel like they weren't necessarily in a school or haven't been in a school before. As a teacher you are one person in front of 20 and if they ever decide that they aren't going to listen to you anymore, that-- You're outnumbered. And so it is very imperative in the classroom for you to set some type of boundaries for your kids or you're gone for the rest of the year. I'd like for you to meet Ben Fields. -Ben, nice to meet you. -Good to meet you as well. So what are you speaking on today? Just the book you wrote, I guess? Yeah, the book, you know, the root cause of the Parkland School shooting. The tag line is that the Parkland School shooting was the most avoidable mass murder in American history and the policies that made it inevitable have come to your kids' school. You've seen this in the front line, right? The way that they strip SROs, strip teachers. Absolutely, when we ignore crime and bad behavior the very people that get hurt are the minority people. You know, there's just-- the school to prison pipeline is one of the biggest hoax I've ever heard of. It simply isn't true. And yet, and yet that's what they sell. And it's disgraceful. This issue I've been working on trying to expose the underside of this discipline reform business, right? Fight the school to prison pipeline by reducing suspensions, expulsions, and arrests. We get all those numbers down quite frequently simply by systematically hiding misbehavior or refusing to enforce the rules. The Parkland shooter story. If one single individual in the Broward County School District made one single responsible decision about him, it probably could've been averted, but every irresponsible decision actually makes total sense given the policies that govern the system. I really appreciate your coming today, Max. I'd also like to acknowledge that we have with us Ben Fields. His claim to fame is he did his job and then they disagreed with him about how he did his job. When I first saw the incident with Officer Fields in Spring Valley High School it mirrored incidents that I had seen in the high schools that I had been in and the incidents that had been described to me by multiple teachers with out of control students and students who came to school and did not obey any directive of a teacher. You can't allow two percent of the population to determine the education for the whole. When people say, you know, you need to be able to exclude a student from a classroom, you need to be able to have school resource officers present or you need to have police present in schools because you wanna make sure that learning can take place, they should watch that video. Because certainly no learning was taking place while that girl was being dragged across the room. Certainly no learning was taking place that day, the week that followed, for the months that followed thereafter, while those students have to live the aftermath of witnessing that in school and wondering if that will happen to them again. I asked the young lady if she would get up and come with me. She said, no, she hadn't done anything wrong. To which my response was, "I hadn't said you did, but get your stuff and come with me. You know me. You know I'm a fair guy. I've dealt with you before." To which again she refused. And at that point in time I approached her and went to place her under arrest and the fight was on. She cracked me in the jaw. She pulled away from me. I got her out of the chair. And the getting out of the chair part is the part that went viral. Schools need good, fair, firm discipline. Look towards me, not the camera, I'll just get you to say -and spell your name for me. -All right, Ben Fields, -B-E-N, last name, F-I-E-L-D-♪. -Tell me why -you wanted to be here? -We're not allowing teachers, administrators, and for this, for that matter police officers to do their jobs to keep schools safe... One of the things I talk about a lot is the whole race thing. This thing is about race, right? And so what happens is, is you have-- You have Black and white people who every day get along really well. You have Black and white people who coexist on a daily basis. They work together, they go to school together, and they get along together. And what happens is the media takes something and they try to divide us, meaning the regular everyday working class person who really makes this country tick, and they try to make us think that civil rights just ended yesterday, that slavery just ended yesterday, and that, you know, the racial disparities in this country are so great. My story was a good story because it was a white deputy and a Black girl. She made the decision to fight a uniformed officer that day. And the only person that was ever punished that day was who? Ben Fields. I lost my job. Regardless of anything else, Ben Fields was the only one punished out of that situation. (rain pattering) When you can't trace the past into the present, you are left with deeply problematic explanations for current conditions. Victim blaming explanations. I'm thinking about Trayvon Martin and I saw an interview with one of the jurors who said that George Zimmerman just seemed like such a nice guy, so relatable. And I think that's worth noting. Trayvon Martin, he didn't seem like a nice child or didn't seem relatable? He seemed threatening? But George Zimmerman with a gun, he seemed like a nice guy and relatable? So because Black people are seen as inherently criminal, Black children are also seen as inherently criminal. The core concern I have is that we know now. It's not an open question. We know conclusively from research that Black kids do not engage in more disciplinable type offenses in their schools. It is not that there's a particular gene for Black kids that makes them misbehave more. That's not accurate. And so, we need to throw away that frankly racist notion that kids of color are worse, and educate all of our kids like we believe in them. Educate all of our kids like they're valuable and treat them like they are somebody's beloved baby in that classroom. Mm, I'm just frustrated. About a lot. You know, I feel that once I put, every time I put one step forward I'm taking two back or like I can be on a good path and then something just come and set me all the way back. What made you come back to your mom's? My sister. Just being there for her, that was the whole reason. Once again with the unhealed trauma. If you talk to her, I often call it wisdom. She's one of those people that your grandparents would be like, "That's a wise child." Her dreams and her hope and that passion that she has for certain things, but all these barriers upon barriers. Are you okay? What do you need to be okay? That incident it sheds a light on how quickly we are to like just leave people. There's a lot at stake. Well, what we can do is we do like a practice test on just maybe that section or just, you know, work on that for a while until you really, really feel like you have it. Like some of this is easy because I know how to do the multiplication so that's how I do division, but then when I get to like this It's confusing. Okay. Hopefully, just zone in. The only pressure that you have is, you know, whatever you put on yourself. Like you've already come so far, So, you know, but especially getting that close and you've only got one more piece.

Okay, so Charlotte today was, an individual from the Manhattan Institute who went down to Parkland where the shooting took place. And what he did is he took a look--and this all kind of evolves around what, school safety and things like that, some of the stuff I've been talking about. This kid's criminal and bad behavior -was ignored by administrators. -Right. Constantly and because it was this kid was able to get and buy guns because he had no criminal record. And the shooting really could've been avoided in every way. And what's happening is it's being ignored because they want their arrest numbers down, they want discipline numbers down, and that's essentially -what it's about. -We'll say his behavior kept being ignored all this time. I'm going to say a child kept being ignored all this time. When you're talking a criminal you're definitely talking about a criminal, somebody who goes and shoots everybody is a criminal, no doubt about it. But it looks as though when it starts with a teacher calling for assistance 'cause a student is not putting away their phone or closing their book or being compliant with what they're saying is the same as someone who would pick up a gun -and go shoot their classmates. -Obviously, there's no comparison between somebody who kills 16 students, right? And then somebody who was just-- Because Black girls aren't doing that. Understand something, who was disrupting a classroom and then resisted a lawful arrest, which is what happened in my situation. You can like it or not, but that's what happened. My point is simply this, bad behavior is being ignored in schools. But if the automatic label is criminal, there's already all these things. That--that's, criminal behavior is criminal behavior. It is not criminal for me to roll my eyes at a teacher. Let's be human, there are certain people who get the benefit of being humanized, no matter how grotesque the behavior can be, i.e. when we think about Dylann Roof, dude gets to go to Burger King and get a burger after you have just murdered nine people. -But for her- -Those are--those are conspiracy theories and let me, let me, let me stop you. Dylann Roof was a conspiracy theory? Whoa, whoa, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. You didn't see this on the news? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, I'm not saying it's not the truth, but what I'm saying is in interrogations we give suspects food all the time. That's not an uncommon thing to do. He gets to be interrogated. African Americans primarily get to be dead before they're even questioned. That's--that's false, but okay. -It's false, Ben? -It is false. -How is it false? -That's a false statement. Okay, Walter Scott. Was he, was he-- Did he get to be interrogated? You're making blanket statements about things that you're not educated on, and I'm not-- What I'm getting at you're missing my point, though. The Walter Scott situation, where that cop shot and killed Walter Scott, right? He is now doing 20 years in prison, is he not? Yeah, but Phil an do Castile, he says, "I have a concealed weapon and I have a permit." -Shot and killed in his car-- -And that cop was charged. Yeah, but the thing is, it occurred. And you wanna keep--I'm not talking about the after. Hear me, white kids and Black kids do the same things, they get different levels of punishment, and that's the-- And we disagree on that, 100% disagree. Yeah, you shouldn't be working with kids, I'm sorry. What I'm saying is--Listen, do you understand what my-- And I said this, bad behavior's being ignored was the point. -And I said that, that's right. -This mass shooting could have been avoided, that's my point. Right and bad behavior-- and I said, bad behavior's being ignored among police. -And you can't accept that. -Okay. I want you to understand that where you were and what Charlotte was about, does color and play into how you think about what we're talking about. I'm not even going to continue to try to explain that because yeah, right, right. You know, because I don't feel this feeling from you that you actually really care. You care, but the breadth of your reading is confined within one area. Because that supports the thoughts and the ideas that you want to foster, that's going to continue to tell you that nothing you did was wrong in the situation with Shakara. That's what--that's what we need to be. So we--so we--So, I definitely didn't do anything wrong in that situation, but here's the point, we can disagree on it, so disagreeing is turning into you attacking me personally now. But that's what you've been doing all night. I didn't say anything about you personally. You've been slugging all night, dude! Hmm, okay, all right. I think this is a good example of the burden that, that Black people bear in trying to educate White people. This is one of the reasons you hear more and more, Black people saying, "White people, go talk to your own. It's nowhere near as exhausting and demoralizing as it is for us." Defensiveness that functions to refuse any challenge to your world view, any growth, any opening, that's white fragility. And that's what we're seeing in Ben, an absolute refusal in the face of incredible opportunity for growth. An opportunity to bear witness to the impact that seeing this happen to this girl had on so many Black people. He refuses it. ♪ Yeah! Thank you, guys! Y'all give it up for Miss Vivian. (cheering) Oh my god, okay. A little over two years ago, I came here to hug two girls, who should a never experienced what any child should experience. And I literally, only came here to stay for two days, so to look out right now and to know what we've been doing, and how many girls I got to hug, I'm having a moment. (cheering) Um... I will forever say, Black girl, no matter what this world tells us, you are loved, you are supported, and you are beyond magical. We chose these grounds because the South got something to say, and even more so, we got something to teach. (clapping) I'm gonna bring your attention to Miss Bree New some in the crowd. Bree is the woman who climbed up the flagpole on these grounds and brought down the flag. Miss Bree New some! (cheering) I was, in that moment, representing everyone who has contributed to the struggle for hundreds of years, the struggle that has been going on. I wasn't without fear, I just had a belief in something that's greater than my fear, and I have a determination to fight for it. Come on, yes! This is like a full-circle moment for me in so many ways. So, God bless all of you, and I wish you all the best. Thank you. Miss Bree, light her up. (cheering) And we want her to know, that no matter where you go, -every Black girl got you. -Yes. I love it. -The same way you had us. -Yes. (clapping) ♪ This is actually my favorite part of the conferences, when I get to celebrate and just acknowledge people. Brianna Bell is a high school student from San Diego, California. Two months ago, she was assaulted by a school resource officer. After her assault, Brianna chose that that was not gonna stop her, she's gonna graduate this year, but she also started mobilizing students to remove officers from schools. And now, there is a young lady in the room. We're gonna have our first Every Black Girl Black Girl Magic Award recipient, Shakara Murphy, acknowledge Brianna, and present her with her award. (applauding) Hello, my name is Shakara Murphy, most of you know me from a video that went viral when I was assaulted... by a school resource officer at Spring Valley High School, in 2015. I stand here today to honor another Black girl who experienced what I experienced, Brianna Bell. Brianna, I know that this journey has not been easy, but I thank you for choosing to stand for yourself and other students. It is my honor, as the first Every Black Girl Black Girl Magic Award recipient, to present to you the 2018 Every Black Girl Black Girl Magic Award. We stand with you. Can you please come to the stage? (cheering) I'm just so honored to be among so many women that understand that they have to have their voices be heard. So, I'm just so honored that so many people in this room understand, not only my struggle, but they understand my need to not shut up, to not be quiet. They understand that I need to have my voice heard. (clapping) When Shakara first came to us, I knew that there were some challenges ahead. She didn't wanna sit in the classroom with her back toward the door. So I had to rearrange my classroom to make sure that she was comfortable, for her not to fear of someone coming up behind her. And she expressed that, "Hey, I'm not good in math." And I told her, "Neither am I! I'm a reading teacher!" But I told her, I said, "If you put your mind to it, it's something that you can do." It was almost two years that she had worked to accomplish this goal. She's had just so many challenges before, she just wants someone to care and once she figured out that, hey, they care what I do, and it matters what I do, that made all the difference. ♪ Here we are. I heard that even your teachers were crying when they found out you passed. Like, the number of people that's cheering you on. Yeah and I stayed up a couple nights all night, just studying, I was like, somehow Imma get it, I don't care how I do it, -I'm just, I'm gonna pass. -Yup. It was a long road, but you did it. If you use this as evidence that no matter what life throw at you, it ain't nothing that you can't get past, it's nothing that you can't create. I haven't really thought about the situation. I'm trying to move forward because I know that was, like, a really hard time in my life. You know, I used to be a little bit more outgoing, and I'm just trying to get back to that point without thinking-- dwelling on the past and thinking about it. Yeah and I have you to thank for a lot. You've been, like, there. There's times when I couldn't get to the doctor. You was like a second mom, you made sure I got there. You went outta your way, no matter what time of day it was, to be there, you know, I can come to you and tell you everything and, you know, a lot of our talks made me keep going. Thank you, what happened to you should not happen to anybody, but like I told you from the beginning, you got me for life. My life shifted, it totally changed. All the thousands of Shakaras that we wouldn't have known and been able to reach, we've been able to reach, right? And so--And I owe that to you, that's why I said, so you got me for life. My word is my bond, so. ♪ Back to our top story, a Richland County deputy and school resource officer now out of a job. A federal lawsuit claims a Richland school resource office sexually assaulted a female student at Spring Valley High School. ♪ Today we arrested Jamel Bradley. He's charged with criminal sexual conduct, third degree. Uh, this is an incident that occurred in 2018 with a student at Spring Valley High School. Unfortunately, we had a monster that worked among us. Um, and that we did not know about. But we do now know, and he has been arrested. This is still a very active investigation, but we felt like he needed to be arrested and he needed to be arrested today. Sheriff Lott says, "Oh my god, how could this happen?" But, I'm like, you do the same speech and you make it about your SROs, that's just one bad apple, that's one bad apple. At some point you gonna have to be, like, "Oh, I picked these apples.” Sheriff Lott said yesterday that RCSD learned of the sexual abuse allegations that Bradley has been charged with less than a week ago. But RCSD told me today, that there has been five separate internal investigations into Bradley during his decade-long career as a school resource officer. ♪ This is a real structure over here that would have given them something to get out of flood waters. (birds chirping) There are many people in this country, especially in South Carolina, who will say, "Yeah, slavery's done. What's the big deal?" Right? "Why do Black people act like they're still enslaved." Right? Or, " Slavery," um-- or, "Slavery was yesterday." Like it just ended. Nobody's owning people anymore. But, we have inherited that mentality of racial oppression. This idea that within our society, certain people belong in certain places. Black people belong in a subjugated space, like they belong in-- They're an underclass of people. And if you're in the underclass, then you do what you're told, you don't challenge the system, and your space is to make white people comfortable by not talking about race, by not acting out, by not-- By changing the way we talk, and changing the way we act, so that white people feel comfortable. When those unsaid rules of who belongs where is challenged, that's when the wrath is felt. I can't breathe! I can't breathe! I can't breathe! -I can't breathe! -America has plunged into chaos. The recent deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery... They're all fueling massive demonstrations nationwide. -Black lives matter! -Protestors and activists are demanding justice for Black Americans that have been facing systemic racism for decades. Black lives matter! Black lives matter! Black lives matter! Black lives matter! Black lives matter! Black lives matter! Black lives matter! Black lives matter! Black lives matter! Systematic oppression needs to end! I can't breathe! We always say children are the future. The children are now the adults who get to lead. Schools are a microcosm of what we see in our world. Just like what happened in Spring Valley, what brought us here to start this whole stuff around, there was a 17-year-old girl who stood watching three authority figures in a room harm a Black body and say, "No, you can't do this." George Floyd was killed and a 17-year-old Black girl stood, filmed the whole thing and said, "No, you can't do this." And so, the nation just had enough. This is what democracy looks like! This is what democracy looks like! This is what democracy looks like! This is what democracy looks like! Mama, I can't breathe! Mama, I can't breathe. Those are the words of a dying man. (indistinct crowd) I keep saying it's not about Ben. Once again, this is bigger than him. He's a representation of what we see on a larger scale -with white America. - I need teachers that care about me and my brothers and sisters! I don't need to walk down the hallway and see a SRO with his knee in somebody's back. He still doesn't understand the difference between accountability and blame. So as long as he thinks he's gonna be blamed, he's never gonna say, "Oh, I see my role in this." I'm with these people half of the day, for half of my life! I don't need to worry about going to jail! I am begging y'all, if y'all want change, change it! (crowd cheering) They say Ben was just one bad apple, well, no, this whole barrel is contaminated. As long as they're starting at the top, and that's the place where it's been granted permission, it's just gonna be another Ben on another day. Teachers matter! Teachers matter! Teachers matter! Teachers matter! Teachers matter! Teachers matter! Teachers matter! Teachers matter! I'm here today with a call to action. We demand to divest from police and invest in our children. This demand is not new, let's talk about Spring Valley, 2015, when a school resource officer assaulted a child for not giving her cell phone. What is safe or resourceful about that? Think about that when we're talking about removing policing from schools. I need each of you to contact your school boards, your mayor, and your governor, and tell them police officers get to be removed and invest in social services, education, our teachers, because our children's lives depend on it, but also I'm very clear And Imma get emotional, I know I am. They don't have to keep showing up for the fight that we should a already had for them a long time ago. (cheering) We're at the tipping point. And I think we've actually tipped over. We gonna change it now, or we'll never change it again. This is the moment. ♪ Black students matter! Black students matter! -Our teachers matter! -Our teachers matter! Well another protest today in downtown LA. This time by students. They're pushing to eliminate the LA school police department.

Now One Pennsylvania and the Education Rights Network are calling on the district to remove police from campuses.

I prefer not to have to travel again, and the hope is, there won't even be an opportunity for me to go, because there will be no more Shakaras and Graces. This is the work towards transformation.
