Martial arts competition begins. Excuse me. The point is for them to learn from each other, hopefully both sides will benefit. Tell them to stop. Sony, official Yuan. New at the post maybe you ain't familiar with the rules They were made by General Nalan. The match won't end until one side has lost or has declared defeat. Stop the fight. Or someone would be killed. Don't worry. They signed a contract, we're not liable. If they die, it's meant to be. Give me my reward... Boss, should we reward him? What's the use for a loser like him? Yes. "Disclaimer contract" Can we continue? Yes. Continue. Who's up? Huang Long, the Single Spear. Fight... They're serious, trying to take the others life. I'd do the same, the reward is fifty taels of silver. Fifty taels. Move over. What was that for? Go to helll Talks too much. I've bet quite big on him. Excuse me, how can I join in the competition? Join in? I could knock you out in one blow. Don't bet on the fat man with the knife, he'll lose. Look What are you talking? You're saying that I'll lose? Sure. Not powerful enough, bad stance.

I won't allow them to continue. Those are only the small potatoes, you should be after Kahebu, he's behind everything. I'll take this to the General, about them gambling in the martial arts competition. General Nalan is Manchurian, so is Kahebu. You'd rather be very confident; otherwise, it's not unusual for a new ll magistrate to get killed. The suspect is dead. Whit'? The suspect has been killed, Sir. That's why you shouldn't act rashly.
