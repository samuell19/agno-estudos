MICHELLE: No! You promised! HOWARD: Come on, Angel. MICHELLE: You said the zoo! HOWARD: You'll feel mellow. When I say no, I don't mean yes! David, back in the other room. We're not quite ready yet. Look, this has never happened before. Let me have a few days to work with her. She'll be much better the next-- Howard, you don't understand. It's over for her. Bring on the next one. You know, you're very hard on her. Did I get her pregnant? Dennis, don't. She just-- She just needs you to... be more gentle and... And, well, a few days-- The few days you need to take care of her abortion won't solve her problem. She's coked up, dropped down, and burned out. [♪♪♪] Oh, bus her back to Wichita. Fresno. Fresno? She's from Fresno. Fresno, Wichita, whatever. All right, that's it for this one, gentlemen. You can take the rental equipment back. Remember the deposit for once, all right? [♪♪♪] [ROTARY PHONE DIALING] One more like her, it's over, Howard. Whistleblowing time. No more money, no more free cassettes, no more magazine sales. Uh, extension 421. No more "do you wanna be in movies?" line to scam kids. Steve, it's Dennis. Yeah. It's gotta be developed tonight. It's a rush. I'll hold. Whatever you do to them-- sex, whatever-- that's your business. But for my business, Howard-- Oh, perfect! Perfect, Howard. You never let me down. Oh, no. No. No. No. No. And no. Howard, I need that innocent but pouty look. Just like she had. But Candy here is a mirror image of Michelle. Pass, Howard. Either find the girl or not. You've got my service number. I'll get her. Count on it. You're a real professional, Howard. The best. [MICHELLE HUMMING] [♪♪♪] Angel? Angel. We'll go to the zoo now. PRINCIPAL: And so, boys and girls, friends and parents, we reach this special day as a weary traveler reaches the end of a long journey, happy to have achieved his destination, joyful to be filled with the memories of the special bumps and turns in this academic road that has led us over high mountains and deep valleys. And yet we are apprehensive, Probably even a little fearful of the future, because each of us here knows we have only reached a village, not the ultimate city of knowledge. That lies ahead, over the horizon line. So let me talk to you about you. Each of you very special human beings, each of you very dearly loved by those you leave behind. So as you steadily advance into young personhood, maturing as surely as summer follows spring, we want you to look back on these formative years at Edison with a warm glow. And whatever junior high you attend, we ask you to carry our colors proudly and with honor. So this is it... the culmination of years of laughter and hard work. And to the graduating sixth graders and their parents, we at Edison say congratulations. [ALL APPLAUDING, CHEERING] Hey, Jennie, I'll see you at Luther. Oh, no, I don't think so. I live over by Jordan. Well, maybe see you this summer. Good luck, Jennie. Thanks. You too. Congratulations, Jennifer. You did it. [GIGGLES] Mom... Oh, okay. I'll save the kissing for the car. Forgot my beautiful daughter was voted the shyest here. Boy, you goofed up heredity. Ah, Jennifer. Yeah, it's been rough. Why don't you, uh, go sign programs or whatever it is everyone does? Mom, you'll be late. Well, I'll be late. It's a special day. Go on. Go on. You're Jennifer's mother? Mm-hm. Jennie, will you sign mine? Gosh, I didn't think you knew my name. She was really happy at this school. Oh, Mrs. Foster, I wanted to meet you at open house, but I work split shifts, so... The, um, last three months of school, I've-- I've tried to be sensitive to Jennifer having lost her father. Now, meeting you... someone has also lost a husband. [SNIFFLING] Oh, thank you. Oh, Mom... It's a kind of a floating heart. It moves back and forth on the chain when you put it around your neck. I love you. Oh! I love you more. We're gonna make it... together. You and me. [CHUCKLES] Punkin! [LAUGHS] Congratulations, ha! Sure sorry I couldn't make it. Aw, thanks for the loan of the car, Frank. I tried every which way to get someone to drive my old roach coach for me, but, uh, well, you got me the rest of the day. That is some kind of graduation dress. Oh, she was great, Frank. Your dad, he'd have sure been proud. I know I am. Yeah, thanks. Uh, Mom, you're late. Ooh, yes. Oop! Here we go. From Edison to Jordan Junior High in one day. Must feel real grown-up now. Notice her hair? She's too grown-up for me to braid it. [FRANK CHUCKLES] I like it braided. Oh, I saw a corner set in the paper today on sale for your apartment. [ROMANTIC SONG PLAYS ON RADIO] Oh, I love this song. [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] Now, Frank, don't feel like you've gotta babysit Jennifer. Hey, I got enough paperwork and schoolwork to more than last till you get home. This is a grown-up young lady now. Right, Jennifer? Congratulations again, honey. I like your hair. [CHUCKLES] Bye, Frank. Thanks. Hey-- Ah! Mmm... Okay. Bye-bye. [ENGINE STARTS] GIRL [ON TV]: I can't. I have to go to the library to do a book report. BOY [ON TV]: I'll drive you there. GIRL: It's upstairs... FRANK: That really true, what your mom says, that you're a grown-up young lady now? [SIGHS] Well, it'd be my advice to stay your age forever. Between my own bills and the company's duplicate and triplicate... I get this crazy notion about night school. [CHUCKLES] What's funny? Oh, that. Oh! Oh, say, I almost forgot, the ball game's on. Do you mind? They only show them a few times a year. These go all the time, right? Okay? It's okay. Oh! I really appreciate it. Anytime you want me to do something, I'll do it, okay? Okay? Yes, okay. [BASEBALL ANNOUNCER SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ON TV] Thanks again, Punkin. I really love baseball. [♪♪♪] Jennifer, did they teach you--? [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] Hey, Jennie, where you headed? I don't know where I'm headed. I'm going to the Kurly Kone. I'm sorry. I-I'm gonna stop talkin' like a Nebraska farmer one of these days. You need some money? I'll take you over there as soon as the game's over. Hey, Punkin, I'll put your show back on. Damn. [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING AND PEOPLE CHATTERING] [VIDEO GAMES BEEPING, CLATTERING] Watch out. You look exactly like someone who's having fun and wants some more. Huh? I'm Howard, or Howie. Have fun. I don't think I should-- Don't, never, can't, won't, shouldn't? All bad words. Accept. Enjoy. Good words. "Thanks" is a good word too. Thanks. I blew it. Thank you. "You." Very important word. Parents never think about you, right? Only themselves. Thank you? Thank you. Perfect. See you around. Say, watch the birdie. [CAMERA CLICKS, WHIRS] I'll bet you photograph exactly like Olivia Newton-John. I don't think I should talk to you. Oh, your folks told you never to talk to strangers. Well, your folks are right. Sorry. Hey. Hay? Isn't that for horses, cows? [GIGGLES] I forgot your name. You first. Jennifer. Howie. Now, what about hay? Oh. Um, could I see the picture? The picture? Absolutely. Nope, I was wrong. Not even close to Olivia Newton-John. Farrah Fawcett. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] You should really be in movies. I mean, look at that nose and those eyes. That's the secret of all you movie stars, isn't it, the eyes? Did you ever wanna be a movie star? Well, my dad, he got to be in two movies shot here. One with Burt Reynolds. I knew you had a dad who's famous. Yeah, well... he died. I'm sorry. I bet it just happened. April. Car accident? He drove a catering truck. Well, somebody... they don't even know who... robbed-- Well, he had a gun. Hey, you better go home. It's, uh... It's dark. Your mom'll be worried. It's okay. She's at work. Waitress? Mack's. You two live alone? I mean, your mom got a boyfriend yet? No. Well, kinda. I don't know. You better go. You're still having rough times. I know. Really, I do. See you around. Thank you. Jennifer, I got a girls' softball team. We play Saturdays, some nights. We need a shortstop. Well, I-- Oh, I keep forgetting. We're still strangers, right. I'll tell you what, you talk to your mom. Tell her to come see me down at the park. I'm a supervisor. And also Farrah Fawcett's official photographer. Watch the birdie. See you around, angel. [SIGHS] [INDISTINCT CHATTER ON TV] SHERRY: Hello, Jennifer! Hi, Mom. [SHERRY SIGHS] You've gotta turn the TV off if you're not watching it. Aw, Mom, I'm watching it. Unless you've got Superman eyes, you're not watching it from our bedroom. Look at this mess! I mean, can't you do something? I'm working a split shift and you just sit around all day. I just bet... I bet... Yeah, I'm right. The dishes aren't done and the egg is dried on them. Now, you come in here. I want you to see-- I want you to see what you've done, or have not done. Oh, Mom, boring! [GROANS] See? See this egg? Guh! It's like cement. It dries on... Oh, Mom, don't be dumb. Dumb? Oh, dumb! When I was your age-- Ooh, if I have to hear one more of these stupid shows, they're gonna take me to-- I gotta go. You don't gotta do anything, but for once pay attention. Mom, I've heard it all before. Oh, don't you smart-talk me, young lady. You can't get a job till you're 16. The least you could do is help out. If Daddy were here, you wouldn't talk to me like that. God, I wish he was here. Then he could deal with your 12-year-old crap! Why didn't he just give him the money? It was so stupid. He wasn't stupid. He was brave! You're stupid! He wasn't-- Oh, listen, I'm not gonna listen to that anymore. Don't talk to me that way. Stop it! Come here! Stop it, you bitch! Don't you call-- Easy, ladies, easy. I hate you! I hate you! Jennifer... I hate you all! Jennifer, wait! I didn't mean-- Jennie, please wait! [SOBBING] Oh, I shouldn't have hit her! I shouldn't have hit her. Easy, Sherry, easy. Split shifts at work, split shifts at home. She understands. She called me a bitch, and she's right. Now, don't worry about it. I'll go look for her. Oh, I gotta-- I gotta get back. I'm gonna get fired. I will go and I will find her, and we'll come and pick you up. She knows I love her. Of course she does. Of course she does. Come on, now. GIRL: Come on! Come on, Chrissy, come on! Come on, strike her out! [ALL CHEERING] Come on in here! Let's go! "Two, four, six, eight." ALL [CHANTING]: Two, four, six, eight, who do we appreciate? Bruins! Bruins! Yay! COACH: Let's hear it! OPPOSING TEAM: Two, four, six, eight, Who do we appreciate? Scorpions, Scorpions, Scorpions. Shake hands. GIRLS: Good game, good game... Well, hi there, pinball princess. Hi. We're going camping next Saturday, but the following week for sure. Okay, Howie? Okay. We'll win in Diana's honor. Have a great time. Thank you, Howie. Jennifer, right? You know, you don't look like a Jennifer to me. You got a nickname? My dad called me Punkin. Well, we don't want anybody taking your dad's place. Let me see. Angel. You look like an angel to me. How's that? I don't know. Well, if you don't know, I do. Angel it is. Tigers next week, Howie? No, Giants, Sharon. Oh, we'll take it to those turkeys. From your lips to Howard Cosell's ears. Hold it. [CLICKS, WHIRS] You know, today you look more like Raquel Welch. You know, like Raquel with her fancy Ferrari. [BOTH CHUCKLE] It's a great bike. Gift? You pay for it? From my Dad. Christmas present. Hey, let's talk about picnics and parties... and, uh, oh, yeah, softball. Your mom didn't come to see me. You want me to go see her? What's your address? I, uh... I ran away. Oh. Howie, give me a ride? Sure. Jump in. I'll be right there. Not good, Angel. The more you keep things easy at home, the more things you get to do without having them on your case. I just couldn't-- I know, I know. I've heard it all. Pick up the room, wash the dishes, boyfriend gets into it. What should I--? Do? Nope, doesn't look like Raquel. Not one bit. Go home. Pick up your room or whatever your sins were, come back here tomorrow, I sign you on my team. Nuts to them, right? I don't know. Just tell 'em what they wanna hear. You can do it. Hey, you know why you don't look like Raquel? You're sexier. [CLICKS TONGUE] [♪♪♪] FRANK: I've looked every which way all afternoon, Sherry. SHERRY: Where could she go? She used to be my baby. Then it was like we were sisters. Today... it was like I was her enemy. FRANK: Maybe it's too little of you and too much of me. SHERRY: Don't be silly, Frank. Where is she? [SIGHS] It's time for the police, Sherry. [SIGHS] Wait. [♪♪♪] [WHISPERS] Jennifer. I'm so sorry, baby. I promise I'll never touch you again. I'm sorry too. I love you. I love you too. Are you hungry? Would you like something to eat? No. I just wanna go to sleep. Okay. [CHILDREN CHEERING] HOWARD: Come on, let's go! Coming to you! Be ready, be ready! Ball two! All right! Good eye! Okay, all right. Good eye! Keep your eye on the ball. Way to go, way to go! Okay, here we go. Okay! Good, good. Okay, keep your eye on it. Here we go. Walk it off! All right! Make her pitch to you. Come on, baby! HOWARD: Almost ready. Be ready! You can do it! Oh! Strike three! Aw, Howie, I blew it. I'm sorry. No, no. You took a good cut at the ball. You got a run in the fourth. You're coming along. Okay, let's give 'em a cheer, okay? ALL: Two, four, six, eight, who do we appreciate? Cougars, Cougars, yay! You looked great from up there! Your uniform's a little long, but... Mom, I struck out with two men on. Hey, I've seen Rod Carew do the same thing, Punkin. Yeah! Just yesterday. [GIGGLES] Hi there. You folks must belong to Jennifer. I'm Sherry Phillips, her mom. Frank Dawson. Howard Nichols. Uh, Kimmi, you wanna pick up the batting helmets? Wasn't she great? I mean, considering it's just her third game. Mom, I blew it. Well, we'll work on her grip this week. Jennie, you wanna help out? Uh, get the balls and bats, okay? Thank you. Well, nice meeting you, folks. Um, I wanna support Jennifer, but I called in sick today. Well, that's a good white lie. Yes. She's come out of herself since she's been on your team. You're doing a terrific job. I just treat her and, well, all the kids like people and care for 'em. Honestly. You know, if I do get mad at 'em, I let 'em know it and tell 'em you only get mad at people you care about. I'm sure you both do that too. Well, maybe not as good as you, but I try about the same. Is this ours, Howie? No, those rubber turkeys are theirs. Hey, you know, if I had a daughter, I'd order up one just like this nut here. Oh, you got the schedule yet? And your number in case she doesn't feel well, or we go out of town or something? Oh, sure, right here. I have two numbers on the bottom. One's home, the other's an answer-phone thing I'm always checking. You are nice, Mr. Nichols. Mr. Nichols was my father. Howard. Oh, ha-ha! Or Howie. Well, uh, let's make sure we have everything and then I'll take some of you guys to the Kurly Kone, okay? Uh, I'll drop her home later? Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Dipped in chocolate. The best for the best. Here's to the thrill of victory and nuts to the agony of defeat. Let's eat 'em in the car. The flies here are like condors. Thanks, Howie. Like I say, the best for the best. Your mom, uh, she was very nice. She's okay. When, uh-- When they getting married? Married? No. He's just sort of... Well, you know, after Dad died... Come on, Angel, you saw 'em at the game. You may be 12, but you're going on 29. You know exactly what's happening. Really 13. Me. In two days. Well, happy birthday two days early, teen Angel. Thanks. Hey, hold this. We'll take one now... another in two days. See the difference between 12 and 13. Lick the cone. [CAMERA CLICKS, WHIRS] Good. Good. Would, uh... Would your Dad have approved? Of your mom and him, Frank? I know my dad was even jealous of meter readers. Dad knew him at work. Both drove catering trucks. He's a friend of the family. At least to her and Dad. That's all. Uh-huh. See, Mom and I, well, we talked after the... funeral. We're gonna make it together. She works, and I'm kind of like a wife at home. You know, clean up, get the groceries. Were you a love child? What's that? Did your folks plan you, like, uh, "We want Jennifer," and along came Jennifer. Or were you, "Oops! Oh, my God, we got Jennifer." Like me. You mean like an accident? Well, it doesn't make you any better or worse. It just sort of says how your parents must have felt about you at the beginning. Mm-hm. Sexy. [SNICKERS] I look like an anteater. Never wanted to be an ant... till now. [ALL LAUGH SOFTLY] Happy birthday! Happy birthday! Happy birthday. Mwah! [POPS, THEN GROANS SOFTLY] Heh-heh, that's an IOU kiss. IOU the best present ever when I get paid. [CHUCKLES] Thanks, Mom. I'd have bet you were sisters. Hey, Lou! [CHUCKLES] You know when we get older, we get better and younger. [BOTH CHUCKLE] Mom, that's dumb. It's not dumb. First of all, it's for tips, you know. And second, men like women, women like men. It's okay. It's the way God planned it. Zoop, heh! You still like your heart? Tomorrow, Sherry. You keep it all going, Lou. Happy Birthday, little darlin'. Aww! [CHUCKLES] Tsk, oh. You gotta smile better than that for men to like you in this life. [SCOFFS] Mom, he's gross. Oh, Jennifer! You think all men are gross right now. I don't think we need men. We're okay just the way we are. You mean Frank. Sherry, I'll get 'em. Thank you, Julie. No. I mean men, period. Hmm. Jennifer, it's time you grew up. Now, men are just fine. You like your coach. Of course, it's his job for kids to like him. Oh, honey, I gotta go now. Mom? Hmm? Was I an accident? Or a love child? Now, why do you ask that? Sherry, your 10%'s dropping down to 5. Yeah, I'll be with you in a minute. [SIGHS] Your father and I were 18 when we found out about you. And we, uh, got married. And we had you and we loved you. And now, I love you. Oh... Sherry, I'll do the set-ups. Oh, I got 'em, hon. Mwah-mwah-mwah! Happy birthday, daughter. Oh, hey, maybe we could celebrate your birthday by getting our hair done the same. You know, keep the sister number going, huh? Huh? Yeah. Oh, how are you today? [MAN SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY] [ALL LAUGHING] Oh! Oh! You-- MAN: No. Heh, okay, let's start over, okay? Yeah, okay. JENNIFER: I'll call him Fred. No, not Fred. Cross your legs, Angel. No, wait, wait, that's-- That's good, actually. Leave 'em just the way they are, birthday girl. [CAMERA CLICKS, WHIRS] Howard. What an honor. A bear named Howard. Look over there. Good, good. [CAMERA CLICKS, WHIRS] Hey, uh... let's slide the skirt up a little. Raquel time. Just over the knee. No one's watching. What? Just a little bit of skin this time, okay? You know, the body's really a beautiful thing. Didn't you say your dad was in movies, hmm? Yeah? [CAMERA CLICKS, WHIRS] Let's go over there, okay? More privacy. Away from all these clawing, clutching Jennifer Phillips fans. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] Let me tell you about the human body, Angel. It's probably the greatest thing God ever invented. You know, other people your age do it all the time. Here, look. Let me take the bear. Yuck! No, no. No yuck. Come over here. Hop up on the rock. Okay. Oh! Right there. Sit down. Great. Let's try it, okay? You don't have to go all the way. Come on, Howie. Gross. Slide the skirt up over... Just over your knee. Just think about it. Maybe next time. There's nothing to think about. Look at the last few pages. How about the zoo soon? You like zoos? Ooh, I got something real special for you next time. [CAMERA CLICKS, WHIRS] By the way, Angel... I think we should keep our real-- You know, our real friendship a secret, okay? Howie! Come on. It's a beautiful thing. It's why God made Adam and Eve. Oh, you're a young woman. You know all this stuff anyway. Here you go. Perfect. [CAMERA CLICKS, WHIRS] Like I said, we'll keep what you and me mean to each other a secret, right? I mean, your mom and her boyfriend are too busy... you know. [♪♪♪] Watch the birdie. [CAMERA CLICKS, WHIRS] Great. [CAR HORN HONKING] Jennifer, I really wish you'd come. Frank and I have a sort of a surprise. Mom, let's go to the zoo today, just you and me. The zoo? My God, I thought you'd outgrown that. Be something to do. It's cheap. About ready now? Hi, Punkin. Well, Jennifer, the zoo it is, only I can't today. But you're off. Yes, but Frank and I are going shopping. We'd like you to come if you want to. Never mind. We're gonna be, um, looking at engagement rings. No! Mom, you can't. I'll wait in the car. [SIGHS] Jennifer, what's the matter with you? What do you want to hurt Frank's feelings for? He's been so good to both of us. Whatever happened to "We're gonna make it together"? We don't need him. We don't want him. Young lady, I need him. I want him. Now, I don't know why you have to wanna make things harder than they are already. I don't know why you can't think of somebody other than yourself and grow up a little-- Grow up! Grow up! If falling in love with the first man that comes along is being grown up-- Will you settle down a minute and listen to me? You know, you never did love Daddy. [♪♪♪] Ow! [EXHALES DEEPLY] Hey. Let's go to the zoo today. Just you and me, okay? Perfect. I love it. You would? Sure. Outside of one, my favorite monkeys are in the zoo. Still hassled at home? No more running-away numbers? Where do I run to? What happened to your hand? It got scratched. Come on. Dr. Howie's on call now. You ought to know what bad is, Angel. Up here. My dad drank. My mom played around. Then my mom drank and my dad played around. [WINCES] Sorry. Sometimes parents don't care whether you're alive or dead. You wonder why they had you in the first place. That's why I asked you if you were a love child. There. Better? Better. Good. Zoo time. One stop on the way, okay? Okay. [WHINING SOFTLY] Mine? You really mean it, mine? Somebody's gotta save his life. After six days you kill 'em, right? He's dewormed. Soft food and love. Lots of love. We prefer calling it population control. Or putting it to sleep? I'll fill the release out up front. He's just wonderful. He's Fred. He is indeed. Mmm! Just tell your mom you found him, okay? You know, the zoo probably doesn't need another ferocious beast. Let's do the lake again, okay? Okay. [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING] [CHUCKLES, THEN HUMMING] Great. Okay, let's try some shots without your clothes on. Howie! Oh, I'm sorry. I meant without the blouse and shorts. You can keep your bra and panties on. They cover more than a bikini anyway. It's okay. It's such a nice day. Like those magazines I showed you. You know I'd never do anything to hurt you. Please? Fred'll pose with you. He'd never hurt you, either. Fred's naked. I love you. You got a different camera. Oh, this? Yeah, the quality's better. You'll see. I'll-- I'll give you a full set of prints. Just like a real movie star. [♪♪♪] Okay. Why not? Exactly. Why not? [SHUTTER CLICKING] [SIGHS] There. Happy? [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] [CAR DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] Easy, Punkin. Where you off to? Practice. You had practice yesterday. Team's having a party. Ah. Well, can I give you and this good-looking dog you found a lift? It's okay. Um... I was, uh, hoping for a chance to talk. [POP MUSIC PLAYS SOFTLY ON CAR RADIO] What about? FRANK: You. Your mom. She, uh... She's the best thing that ever happened to me. That's another way of saying I love her. I gotta go. Uh... You could be the second best thing if you'd give me a chance. The best thing that could happen to me is if you'd just leave me alone. [SIGHS] Punkin, I'm just trying to be your friend. No, you're not. You're trying to be my father. I had one, and you'll never be him! Punkin, I don't want-- And stop calling me Punkin. Jennie! [TIRES SQUEAL, HONKING] DENNIS: She's perfect, Howard, perfect. You came through. HOWARD: Thanks. Oh. Now, if she can put a sentence together-- Oh, that's it. You sure? She-she's not quite there, but she's coming along. I just wanted you to know I was trying. [CHUCKLES] Next weekend? Dennis, I-I'd need more time. I mean, she may not even be right. I could find someone else. You can do it, Howard... [KNOCKING] ...assuming she can talk. Hi, Angel. There's the star of our movie. What's your name, young lady? Uh, Jennifer. Jennifer who? Tell us about Jennifer who. Dennis is the director I told you about, Angel. This is Heather and David. Just be easy, okay? Jennifer who? Uh... Jennifer Phillips. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] More. I'm 13. And I go to junior high school next year. I'm kind of into gymnastics. Are you shy, Jennifer? When I want to be. If I like somebody, I'm okay. And if you don't? Then I feed 'em to Fred. [LAUGHS] Terrific. Terrific. She's perfect. David'll be your co-star. Dennis, I told you. Howard showed me these. You're exactly right in front of a camera. You mean, this is like movies? Well, David's done a lot. We'll make you a star. Now how would you like that? I don't know. Dennis. Too much, too fast. Uh, why don't you guys play with Fred for a while? Get acquainted. Hmm? [SMOOCHES] Puppy, puppy, come on. Puppy, puppy. [DOOR CLOSES] Listen, kid, give them what they want. A little skin, some action, a toothpaste smile. You'll be the first on your block to get anything you want. Well, I think all Jennifer wants to do is play with-- What's his name again? Fred. Fred be nimble Fred be quick Fred jump over The candlestick How long you lived here? Six months. With all this? Oh, no. I meant I been acting for six months. Me and two other guys live in this apartment. A girl was with us. Hey, is Howie gonna set you up in our place? I live with my mom. She's a waitress. No, listen. I-I made a mistake. She's not for you. She's-- [LAUGHS] Of course. It's not even the money this time. You really love her, don't you? Okay. Look, let's forget it. Let's just forget it, all right? No. You'll find yourself somebody else to fall in love with on that ball team. I want this one. I can't let you-- Oh, yeah, you can, and you will. 'Cause I can make you lose everything. Don't threaten me. Make no mistake-- I am threatening you, Howard. 'Cause when the whistle blows, it'll all be there for the world to see. To despise. You'll lose her anyway. I can just disappear-- Poof. Kansas, Florida, Illinois. No, you'll find another shortstop, just for yourself. This one's mine. [DOOR CLOSES] Frisky Fred. Frisky Fred. [FRED GROWLING PLAYFULLY] [KIDS LAUGHING] Heather. Come on, let's go, kid. Howard, we'll make three, maybe four movies next week. No. Makes you feel good. I'm okay. Okay, stars. You ought to be in pictures, and you will be. Let's go outside. We'll do your first screen kiss. Don't worry, I won't bite. Unless you want. Just like John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John. Okay. Okay, David, stand about here, and Angel, you right here, okay? Good, good, good, good. Okay. David. [CAMERA CLICKS] Perfect. Perfect. Okay, uh, one more. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Perfect. [CAMERA CLICKING] Hey, guys, I'm not ready yet. Okay, this is the one. Okay. One more. [CAROUSEL MUSIC PLAYING] [CAMERA CLICKING] Great. Angel... Okay. One more and you're ready, guys. For this one, we need the suits off. Howard! David... take a swim. [DAVID SPLASHES] [SMOOCHES] Come here, Fred. Come here. [♪♪♪] I won't hurt you. Fred and I, we said we'd never hurt you. Howard, I don't want to. Yes, but I want you to. I need your help. I need you very much. Does anyone in the world need you? Your mother, her boyfriend? I need you. I want you. But it's wrong. Some people think so. I've shown you people who don't. I want you to do it, Angel. If you don't, you'll lose me. I'm all you have. My mom. Have you thought about when they get married? They could send you away. He certainly doesn't want you. Who wants to raise someone else's kid? [SUCKS TEETH] Howard, I can't. I like you. No, no, no. You love me, Angel. Love me. And I love you. I'm all you have. Help me? [CRYING] I want to, but... I'd have to send Fred back. I couldn't let you keep him after hurting me. Fred never hurt any-- But you'd hurt me. You know how they kill dogs in those places. They put 'em in a chamber. No windows, no air. Black. Then they push a button. A small button that literally explodes. Stop it! [FRED WHINING] It's up to you, Angel. Only you. [PILLS RATTLE] David, come on up. Now remember, Angel, this is our secret. See, if they find out about us, they'll break us up. So deny everything. Always say "no." [JENNIFER SNIFFLING] Good. Great. Perfect. Give a smile. Good. Good. Great. Fill 'er up? I'm fine. Sherry. Frank! Take five. Now. Well, my break's not-- It's important. Julie. Thank you. Come on. I can hardly have this inside the truck, let alone inside there. Those idiot sheet metal guys had these. Tell me I'm crazy. This ad's in both magazines: "Nubile Nympho," "Lollipop Lovers." Two movies for the sextra low price: $85. That's Jennifer? I-It can't be, right? Can it? No. It-it isn't. [GROWLING PLAYFULLY] [DOOR CLOSES] SHERRY: Jennifer? Hi, Mom. Fred got carried away. Yeah. I don't know how to say this, so I'm just gonna say it. Say what? Uh... When you're not here, have you been making movies? Movies? Me? I saw an advertisement for two movies, and the girl in the ad looks exactly like you. Mom, you and Dad were into movies. When you're not here, what do you do? You know. Go to the park. Play softball. Watch TV here. Don't you trust me? Oh, I want to. Well, I do. It's just that-- Look-- Yes or no. Is this or is this not you? You must be crazy, Mom. [SIGHS] She says "no." Well, maybe it's just the picture. You know, the camera angle. Come on. [♪♪♪] Stay here. [WHIMPERS] [BLOWS WHISTLE] Okay, guys. Lock-up time. Aw, Howie, two more and we got 'em. He's gonna be steamed. I'm not gonna-- I am steamed. This is the last, last time. Hi, Angel. What are you doing here? Here's all I got. But I thought you were going to stay home for a few days. Mom found out. What? How? An ad. You know, in one of your dumb magazines. You told her it wasn't you? Well, yeah. But... Look, I just can't stay home now. I can stay with you. Oh, no. I'm on my own. People would ask questions. Deny. Say "no." No, no. No way. You got the other kids places. How about me? I'll make it up to you. I am getting older... and better. [♪♪♪] JENNIFER [TEARFULLY]: I don't blame you for hating me. Because it's all true. I couldn't look at you once more without you knowing. I know you'll never want to see me again, but I do love you and Daddy. Don't hate me too much. Hi, help me. I have to report that my daughter just ran away. Yes. Lieutenant Cooper, right over there, ma'am. He'll take care of you. Over there? Yes. Thank you. I know. I'm doing the warrant right now. I'll get there when I get the judge to sign. Without anchovies. Lieutenant Cooper, I'm Sherry Phillips, and my daughter just ran away. My God, that makes it six today. How old? She's 12-- 13. [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] She's shy. Been to different schools. Watches TV constantly. You and your husband are not living together, or you are, and you don't see her much. She's run away before, but you found her. This time she's run away because of dope, pornography, or a man. Stop that, damn it! Stop that. Sherry Phillips, I got stakeouts in progress. I've got reports. I've got paperwork. Look-- Look... I was just trying to save us some time. I'm sorry. Look, I'm in a hurry too. I'm from Nebraska, and, uh, we used to track animals. See, the colder the track, the less chance... Nothing personal, Sherry Phillips, but most people think they can just call or come in here, we push a computer button-- Jennifer. We have no promises. No guarantees. We will try. You try, Lieutenant Cooper. [SNIFFLES, SIGHS] I'm gonna do. [CAR HORN HONKS] I need your car. But you got work. Oh, to hell with work. She could keep on-- She could do it again. Let me go. You stay here. She came home last time. I think-- I know it's different this time. Frank, I've gotta do something, besides being a terrible mother. Hey, I'm just as much to blame. No. It's my daughter and my problem. What did the police say? The police said Jennifer is hardly the world's only runaway. Please, you stay by the phone. If I don't find her right now, tonight, I may never. Just check in, okay? Yes. Is there anything else I can do? You can pray it isn't too late. [SIGHS] Okay, guys, the water slide tomorrow for sure, unless Dennis calls. The price of being movie stars. Remember, no more using or answering the phone, right? Okay. MAN [ON TV]: ...say aloha to the lovely Ms. Jane Nelson. Jane, welcome here. In each round, you'll be shown five possible answers for the questions I'll be asking. Any member of a team may buzz in and answer, but if incorrect, the other team will have... I got the game at 8:00. I better-- Absolutely, you better stay. That's almost the first place they'll look. I'll come back before I go home. I am glad you're here, Angel. I think it's time our special friendship went even further. [♪♪♪] [TV CONTINUES DRONING INDISTINCTLY] Later, Angel. [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] [SWANKY MUSIC PLAYING] [SIRENS WAILING IN DISTANCE] [♪♪♪] [DISCO MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS] [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS; VIDEO GAME SOUNDS] [CHILDREN CHATTERING] BOY: Yeah, come on, let's go! [CHILDREN CLAMORING] [KEYS JINGLING] [DOG BARKING IN DISTANCE] [SIGHS] Mr. Nichols? Howard, or Howie, Mrs. Phillips. It says here you had a ballgame tonight. Yes. We missed Jennie. Is she sick? [SIGHS] I-I don't want you to get the wrong impression of her, but...she's gone. She's run away. Has she done this before? Yeah. Listen, Mrs. Phillips, over the years, I've known thousands of kids. Most of them run away once. Often twice. Howard, I've been to the police, and I've heard it all. And I'm going to find her. I'm sure. I-I just wanted to say that practically all of them come home. Now, if I see Jennie, I'll talk her into going home. I'm sure Jennie loves you. You go home and wait for her. Be there when she walks in. Mr. Nichols, did you take those pictures of Jennifer? Pictures? Yeah. Uh... Oh, she had them up all over our walls. Oh. Pictures. Uh... I don't remember. Probably. I'm always taking shots of the kids. Mrs. Phillips, if I see Jennie, I'll not only talk her into going home, I'll bring her. And I'll look. Okay? That's wonderful. I know I'm nagging, but go home and wait. Whether it's me, the police or herself, I'm certain she'll get there. Whatever happened, you should be home to talk it out. She'll need you. Yeah. I-I think I will. [PHONE RINGING] MAN [ON TV]: Not just being carried away by... physical attraction. WOMAN [ON TV]: How can you be sure? MAN: Because this is 1972. HOWARD [RECORDED]: Hello, this is Howard Nichols. This warm, wonderful machine is ready to take your name, phone number, message, if you like. Get back to you very shortly, okay? Wait for the beep. [MACHINE BEEPS] Mrs. Phillips, it could be the pinball guy, just as it could be a bank president, lawyers, doctors. Coaches? Yes. Coaches, recreation leaders. These people rarely have criminal records. They're people who like and want to be liked. John. Mrs. Phillips, I've gotta-- Lieutenant, just give me the address for this number. Mrs. Phillips, I appreciate your-- Mrs. Phillips, I'll be back in half an hour. Then-- All right. All right. Jim, give Mrs. Phillips the address she wants. For me. Mrs. Phillips... Okay, here we go. Pizza. Pepperoni. Howard. And pepperoni and sausage. Perfect. Rich Beverly Hills brat. Angel? Did you guys win? Does a bear go in the woods? [GUYS CHUCKLE] Eat it in the other room, guys, okay? It's cold. Yeah, I remember my mother's advice on cold pizza. Thirty-two chews or every bite-- One for each tooth, okay. Hello, Angel. Hi, Howie. I want you very much. JENNIFER: Oh. You have me. No, I don't mean as a friend. As a lover. You and me. You mean like--? That's exactly what I mean. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Who's--? Uh, maybe it's Dennis. Remember--? Oh, yeah, could be. Yes? WOMAN: Mrs. Krebs, the new manager. It was you! Please, don't, please! Mommy! You bastard! Stop! I was getting her to come home! Mommy, stop! What kind of monster are you?! You're not a monster. You are worse! You don't understand. Understand?! Oh, my God, I understand. Look at these children! I finally understand! Listen. Please, listen. I listened, all right. Get away from her! Get away! I saw at that window. Before, I hoped, I really hoped, this was just your second apartment. I hoped it wasn't you! I love those kids better than their parents. Better than you! After what you've done to them?! Come on, Jennifer. I've taken them places. I bought them things. You have used them! Let's go, boys. I've given them love. Love? Let's go! I've given them love! Love? Oh, my God. Go. I never hurt you, any of you. Don't leave. Please. You're the most important things in my life. I love you all very, very, very much. Honey, let's go. Please, don't hurt me. Please, don't say anything. Have you ever called Jennifer Phillips and other girls you've known "Angel"? Yes. "Are you--?" Now, they'll be sure to ask this one, so you be ready: "Are you impotent with adult women?" I will object here, the judge will overrule. Okay, answer. Adult women? I-I'm not comfortable with them. As lovers? Yes. But you love children. Yes. And children love you. Yes. How do you get children to love you? You, uh, treat them as people, not as children. Parents want to rule children. Society the same way. My parents beat me when I was young. Then ignored me and beat me. Most parents don't really love their children. They take money, time. You feel, then, that you were a victim? Oh, yes. You see, it's so simple to be loved by a child. You take them places. You listen to them. You touch them. You trust them and they trust you. Suddenly, you're a father figure, even though you didn't mean to be. Even a lover figure? They'll ask that. I suppose. Do you think you're sick? No. Getting children to pose for movies and stills, having sex with children, isn't sick? I'm not sick. I'll object here. Society is. The judge will sustain. The kids have fun with the movies and the pictures. You know, someone once called me a molester. [SCOFFS] Molesters force kids. Hurt them. I love them. And I don't think love between consenting humans is wrong. You know, in every case of child-love, every case, the children never tell. It's society. Society says it's wrong to love a child, not children. Are you aware that a Michelle Moore, one of the kids that had fun, one of your "angels," is presently seriously ill in a mental hospital? Michelle? And angel Jennifer Phillips might have been, if you hadn't been caught by her mother? Well, that's it for now. Bail's arranged. You'll be on the street in 24 hours. Let's go. Come on. Come on. Let's go. No way. Absolutely not. Look, it's behind us. No one is gonna make her relive it. Now, this therapist, Bauder, Carol Bauder, that's different. I mean, it's not public. And we appreciate your telling us what her friends would-- I think we ought to move. Maybe I'm making this too complicated, Mrs. Phillips. I mean, we've got Dennis, and the films are evidence. But without Jennifer's testimony, we're just not gonna prosecute Howard. It's simple. SHERRY: Why can't the others testify? Because they're gone. They disappeared. Well, I'm sorry, but it seems simple to me too. We should pay attention only to what's important to Jennifer. But is it right to let Howard go on? Jennifer, you testify, you can say to yourself: "I tried to make things better for other kids." And what's right for Howard? I know you don't hate him. It'd be easier if you could. And he was your friend. Maybe still is, sort of. But Jennifer, he's sick, in his mind. And he probably doesn't even know it. You and I and your mother know he's done wrong. He needs help. He could go on, sick. Or he could face his sickness in this trial and get help-- good help, thanks to you. Someday, he'd even agree with you. Isn't getting him help the right thing to do? Jennifer? I don't know. Well, I know you've been through an awful lot. But it can make you a whole lot stronger if you help me. Keep thinking, Jennifer. Think of David, and all of Howard's other David's. Like Mark. Joe. Heather. Michelle. You didn't know her. She was before you. She's now in a mental institution. You are not being fair. No, I'm not being fair, but I am being truthful. And he can't go on. Or can he? [CHILDREN PLAYING] Look-- Look at those apes. SHERRY [LAUGHS]: They eat better than some of my customers. FRANK: My Guide Rock always said that apes could really talk. But if they did... [♪♪♪] [CAMERA CLICKS] [CAROUSEL MUSIC PLAYING] [CAMERA CLICKING] HOWARD: I want you to do it, Angel. Gimme a smile. Love me! If you don't, you'll lose me. Good. Perfect, Angel. Perfect. Did they teach you that in school, Jennifer, the difference between apes and gorillas? I think I can do it. Good, Jennifer. Which is which? No, I mean, I think I can testify. No. It's behind us. See, that's why we have to move. Are you sure? I'm sure. She's gotta go back to leading a normal life. You're sure because you're my mother. I'm not sure what Daddy would think. What do you think, Frank? [♪♪♪] Well... People say he's sick. I suppose they're right. One thing we both know for sure: that little girl in the mental hospital is sick because of Howard. [SIGHS] What do I tell you? I worry about you if you testify, and I worry about other kids if you don't. The last thing my little girl needs is more pressure. She's 12 years old. She's 13. And she's not a little girl anymore. This could be the most important decision Jennifer ever makes. She has to know that from somebody. From somebody besides lawyers and mothers. You keep on thinking, Jennifer. [♪♪♪] [VIDEO GAME SOUNDS] [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS] [♪♪♪] Hey, Fred's really growing up, huh? So are you. Don't-- Don't hurt him, please. No. No, Angel. We've all been hurt enough. It's time to stop the hurt. You must have known they'd let me out. I'd be free for good, if you'd-- If you'd help me. That'd be the real grown-up thing to do. Can I have Fred? You know they want to get both of us-- embarrass us about private things-- things that should only be between you and me. People-- Strangers'll look at you in court. They'll show the pictures, the naked pictures. Lawyers'll ask questions, super-personal questions, about sex and stuff. It'd be like a bad, terrible nightmare. Only we wouldn't be able to wake up. It'd be real. [FRED WHINES] Howard, I want Fred. They'll call me sick, and you a whore. They won't understand. I love you. Howard... I do think that you loved me. All-all of us. And I tried to believe that everything was right. Normal, like you said. But I know now it wasn't. And you don't understand it wasn't. And you have to. Maybe I was a wh-- I'm not anymore. [♪♪♪] The prosecution calls Miss Jennifer Phillips. PROSECUTOR: And so, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, we ask all adults to look at those below our eye level to take seriously America's current adult-child relations. There are one million runaways today. Child suicide has tripled in the last 10 years, 30 each day. More than half the patients in our mental institutions are under 21. Many children rarely relate to their parents, to the adults in their community, or the adults on television. And into this void walks the pedophile, the child lover. Now, we don't want to suggest today that every coach, every teacher, every adult our children come in contact with is a pedophile. It is possible that he or she might be. But it is not possible for our children to be psychologically seduced by these sick people if we know and love and discipline and talk to and discover what is in the very bright minds of the youngsters in our lives. We do want to suggest to you, the jury, that we can take one step closer in spanning America's adult-child chasm, by finding Howard Nichols guilty. [CHILDREN SHOUTING PLAYFULLY, LAUGHING] [♪♪♪]
