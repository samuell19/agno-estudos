But Sureshettan hasn't told me any of this. He's just bluffing. I don't think this will work out. You just keep quiet. Say the rest. There is nothing more to tell. We have reached his house. This one? This one? Come. Sureshetta. He'll come now. We are here for Suresh ettan. Suresh! Suresh! What is it mother? Some runaways are here to see you. This mother is reading our faces.

A great fight between two Tamilians in the market. That's when her uncle.. Walks in smoking cigarette in slow-motion. What I don't understand, What did we do Togo through all this? In Bangalore, the police won't interfere with our personal matters. But we are not in Bangalore. We are here right? Jinto, just stop the car. Jinto, just stop the car. I'm getting down here. All this for no reason. I'm stopping all this social service. Don't say that. How can we do this without you? Get lost man. It's their need and we get into trouble.

If it's this big a problem. I'll surrender. Now what's the use of all that. Getting beaten up is almost certain. Move aside. Dear Jinto, Before we run into her uncle, Take this car somewhere Start the car. Start the car. Sir, he had given Angel a rose before. What is that mark on your face. Did the rose's thorn cut you? - Sir, when someone swung a knife. - Quotation? No, dad swung it when he was off to cut down a tree. Sir. He gave her a love letter when she was in 8th. Did you get a reply. No. What is this, one shirt over another. I'm a driver sir. Driver? Sir, he.. Just thinking about all these proposals to a girl in our house. It does feel quiet great. I was the one who caught him sir. He proposed to Angel too? No, we haven't caught him for loving. There is a rental house next to our girl's house at Thrissur. He is the house owner. In his house there are are always two guys there. According to the servant one of the kidnappers were short. One of the guys at his house is also short. Me? Come here. Where are they? Where are they? They have gone for a tour. What tour? Company tour. Company tour. Which company? Not from his job? It's when we all get together.. It's when we all get together.. Company. - Where are you going to? - What is it? - Where are you going to? - What is it? This road leads to the front of my house. If you don't know, the don't show him the way. What are you doing Lovelesh? I told you not to bring such fools into this. Stop hitting. The phone is ringing. It's Sureshettan. Hello Sureshetta, Hello Sureshetta, I'll talk. Sureshetta, It's a complete mess here. This idiot made us round back to the front of her house. We have no idea what to do. Do one thing. Go further down that road. The only place there won't be any police will there. We have no idea what to do. You drive straight down that road. You drive straight down that road. No problem. I'm close by. Okay? Which car are you driving? A white color Omni, MGR BOSS. Okay. How long will you stand here? She'll come. Come, let's go inside. Let her come. Then I'll come inside. Then I'll come inside. Stop here. I'm opening it. Get down. You are here to save us at the right time. Thanks. I don't know if I can save you guys. Police came to my home, the second you left. They might have been there on because of my past. We saw a guy in Mufti. Near your house. Near your house. Then they will be right behind us. Sureshetta, we have been driving around with no idea off what to do. If you could tell us some solution. It would be of great help. There’s a way. Your town is Thrissur right? There is a temple at Thrissur They start conducting marriages from 6 in the morning. Just that one of you has to be a Hindu. If the groom is Hindu then there will be no issues. I know someone from the panchayat near by. We can get there and do the registration before 9am. We can get there and do the registration before 9am. But all we get is a temporary certificate but it has a 6 month validity. We can get this marriage done in between that. - Isn't that enough. - Thanks chetta. A big favor. If all this has to happen. You have to get to Thrissur. This town is surrounded by police. It's not easy to pass them There's only one way. You must hide somewhere for 2 hours. When they can't get any new information on you. They might think you got away. You can go to Thrissur in that time. We'll take care of that. Whatever you did for us. Is superb. We'll take care of the rest. We'll find a place. Then you call me when everything’s set. We have to find some safe place like Sureshettan said. Let's do one thing. If there is any lodge near by... We can stay there for the night. We can leave in the morning. That will be safe I won't come to any lodge. You have no issue if we get locked up. She can't stay in a lodge. Are these your friends? Are these your friends? Great. I have a friend. Her name is Honey. Let's go to her house. She will help me. jinto, take a right from this junction. We can go to Honey's house. Make it fast. Jinto take a right like she said. Honey then, We can go now. her house will be safer than this or a lodge. Yes. Where did you say her house was? That's okay. He know's he'll drive us there. My hair is okay right? Mine? Not so much. Then your's isn't that great either. Get lost, mine is superb. Vinu come. Don't create a problem. I couldn't inform you. But in the end I needed your help itself. What? Stay there. - Go sit there - You come too. Go. - She wasn't talking about me. - She said everyone. Alex. Is this tension on your face from seeing an unexpected host. Are these the brave ones? Us? None of them looks up to that range. Or has your taste changed? S.K. What if we slap him. So how is it, shouldn't we end everything. Should we tell your friends all the story or.. For God's sake. Leave him Alex. I won't talk about the number of years - But I always had you here. - Sorry. Vinu come. Let's go. Come fast. Shoes. Shoes. Come fast, we don't need the shoes and all. Run fast. Vinu, get inside fast. S.K. save me. S.K. save me. Get in. Start the car. Is this the safe place you were talking about? Isn't that the Alex who studied in Nirmala? Who is he to you? Why did he confront us? Why did he confront us? Speak! If it's personal, then no need to say. What personal matter? We are here because of her personnel matter. This is all happening because of her. What personal matter? Let her speak. First you say who Alex is to you.. First you say who Alex is to you.. Or let him say. He is the one marrying her. Say! Alex was my boyfriend. To escape from the marriage fixed with him. That's why I... Here. Vinu, come outside. I have something to say. What are you planning to do? Are you going to marry someone who is fixed for someone else. Vinu, let me be open with you. I was with you till this moment. But i won't be tricked. To get rid of someone shouldn't be the reason to marry you. Tell her to go. We'll drop her home and say good bye. Just because her uncle is in police, shouldn't we all live? It's me who should say sorry to you. She had already told me everything. I never took it seriously She must have done this because she wasn't interested. But please don't leave me. S.K. I have no other way. Leave? We didn't say it in that sense. Try to understand. Like Rahul said. Rest in a lodge. Without taking any risk we can go to Sureshettan I'm ready for anything. I'm ready for anything. But you guys. Shouldn't retreat from this idea. It's not that Vinu. She has another love and all. After knowing that, why? We have all loved and lost right Rahul? I know. You guys are talking a huge risk for me. But whatever happens. Whatever happens. I'll take the risk. Still.. Why are we even living if we can't help such a nice person. Why are we even living if we can't help such a nice person. Like S.K. said police will catch us anyway. So then Let it be after their marriage. Now going any further is a risk. Take the car to a lodge. - But Angeline.. - Then what are we supposed to do? - But Angeline.. - Then what are we supposed to do? Should we run right into the police? - Should we? - No need take the car to a lodge. Superb lodge. S.K. superb. Good setup. Park the car in a way that no one notices. There. There. We'll go and buy some food. From there. - Why? - Haven't had anything since morning. Will you reach fast? It's right next to this place. If there's anything just contact Vinu. Okay. Come Jinto. - Love, where are you going to. - To this shop. - Nearby right - 1km Just shut up and come. I'm hungry. Haven't eaten anything since morning. Bro Bro Bro Awesome, great sign. The current is gone the second we stepped in Bro! Bro Bro This is a routine here. Is there a room here. We need a room. Room? Did they go to buy something? Medical shop is very far away. Should have taken the car. What? Just give us a room. Don't talk too much. Including them 5, right? Do you need 5 rooms or 2 rooms is enough? 2 rooms is enough. 2 rooms is enough right. Okay then. 2 rooms is enough right. Okay then. Give it. Room up we'll find it. The room is above. - Which is the room? - Let me check - Which room? -I'm checking. Just say, we'll also look for it. This one? We'll take this. Let them take that What is your problem? Can't you speak? Don't irritate me Angel. I've been bearing all this for sometime. Hello! Hello! - Is S.K. there. - He isn't, tell - Is S.K. there. - He isn't, tell There is only porotta here. Then with that either beef gravy or sambar. You eat beef? Buy whatever you want. I know all this anger is targeted towards me. I also know the reason. I also know the reason. I have hid many things from you. I agree. But I never intended to cheat you. Those are things I don't want to remember. Whatever happened in your life. Did I ask you to tell me everything openly? Have we ever told that we love each other? No right? you called me up one day. Told me to come at 11am the next day and marry you. I never said a word. I haven't even told my parents. I came along with you like a fool. To a person like that. What would have changed if you had told this truth? I give too much value for a word. The word trust. You might have no value for that word. There is police around us. - What? - A car has come that way. Police? Escape from there as soon as possible. - What is it vinu? - Police. - What is it vinu? - Police. - Police? - Where? Lovelesh called. The police has reached here. Lovelesh called. The police has reached here. Let's go fast. No time. The police! Come. Come fast. What will we do? What will we do? What will we do?

Did you call me up at this time to teach me the law? Hang up! You are standing in my circle and yet talking upto me? Who are you? My name is Joseph Dhayanidhi. My name is Joseph Dhayanidhi. The circle inspector to this area. - Who is it? - Two-eyes. Oh my god. Put the phone in loud speaker. Hello. Is it clear who I am now? Sir. I know who's driving your car, how many of you are there. I know who's driving your car, how many of you are there. What's happening, I know it all. I'll give you two options. Option A. If you can.. If you can.. If you can. Try crossing my circle. Option B. Park the car to the side. Drop her there and keep going. I won't touch you. I'll also leave all your friends who are in my custody. Hey, don't get nervous. If you drive fast and get into some accident. You have our girl in there. I'm repeating. Listen to me carefully. If you park the car on the side and drop her there. If you park the car on the side and drop her there. I won't touch any of you and I'll also leave your friends. So.. Is the girl important? Or your friends? You decide for yourself. Hello.. Sir.. Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid. We'll do whatever we can to cross this circle. We'll do whatever we can to cross this circle. For sure. There is no issue. They are just threatening us. You don't be afraid. There is no issue. They are just threatening us. You don't be afraid. Threat? Don't play a drama to calm me down. I'm not a fool. I know what Ittupettan's and the others situation will be. When they are trapped among inhumane people. Stop the car. Why stop the car. There is no problem. I told you to stop the car. Stop the car. I'll stop. I'll stop. Are you all martyrs or something? You guys leave. First save your friends. Not just that. What I came expecting. I have realized that I have lost it. Vinu. - Vinu. - She's leaving. Go call her. Vinu just go! What are you thinking about? Go and call her. Vinu she's leaving. What happened? It's all over. That C.I. took Lovlesh and Jinto. She's gone too. What do we do now? Whatever happened. You shouldn't have let her go. What else can we do? We might have to give up something to gain something else. That's when certain looks come across our faces. Looks of small expectations. I have stood in that situation. I have stood in that situation. But then.. No one was there with me. I couldn't do anything. It's not because you guys came to my house or told stories. Or because of your dialogues. Before she left. She glanced at me. The same glance I have seen long back. That's when I saw in her eyes. The pain of someone who never wanted to go back. The pain of someone who never wanted to go back. That's why I came. Let it go. If there is something call me. Okay. Okay. Then bring her back. They must have got her right? They must have got her right? So you won. And my daughter as always lost. Come. What happened? The car isn't starting. Two hearts separate. They part away Alone. Two souls melt away in that. It darkens. It continues. The heart breaks as we part ways. Smile disappears All those dreams destroyed It spirals down itself, far away. The morning fades away in the distance. The heart trembles. Every day is the same. The dreams that burn away. The dreams that burn away. It was my childhood wish to keep staring at the oceans for a long time. Staring at the oceans? Yes. Why? What's your wish? To get a nice job. To build a big house. That's all. Isn't this what 80% people wish for? Then is staring at the ocean such a big thing It's for me. What is it? What happened to you? What good has your love and care brought? I have become a worthless person. I'm fed up in comparing the violence and non violence in everything I do. I can't take any decision for myself. When I do anything. Will it hurt my mother? Whether my father will like it or not. I can't even take a decision now. I can't even take a decision now. I'm scared now. I have become a coward. Aunty, is Vinu here? Did you let Alex take her for us? Come here. That too to a fool like him. You come, We'll face whatever happens. - Come Vinu - Vinu! Now you don't need to check violence and peace in everything. Your grandfather. That is my father. Wasn't a freedom fighter or Gandhian. Thoothukudy Veera Lingam. He was a great smuggler in Madurai. The leader of the poor. The police murdered him when I was 4 years old. We left Madurai then. In your childhood when we used to see you hold sticks like a gun. Then what will I do. Many fathers in our country might be using Gandhiji in such way. I had no other option. So son, don't be afraid. Some action is allowed. Some action is allowed. Where ever she is. Bring her back.

Are you happy after you lost whatever dignity you had? To shame gangsters. Tony where are you sitting? Oh no! Haven't seen her yet. have you told the lawyer everything? My close friend is a criminal lawyer at the supreme court. Should I call him? Must be Maraar from Narasimham? I'll be under that tree. I'm going. Wait. Don't leave me alone. We can go together. Crime No 218/17 Thrissur, Thalapilly Thaluk S/O Gangadharan from Kaarakattil house. Vinu Gangadharan and his team attacked the house of Angeline. D/O Fracis, from Thotapillly house. I heard about that case. What is this? One elopes from her house to avoid the marriage with the man she loves. That too with someone she knows only for 23 days. After abandoning her on the road. He tried to attack her house and kidnap her the next morning. What is this? Some Telugu movie? They might have better believable stories. Is she the mentioned girl? Aren't you educated people? Should you shame the people who took care of you all these years? Can't you avoid doing such things? Whatever happens she doesn't say a word. Then when things get serious she runs away.

There is a lot of meaning to my life in that. With a heart filled with hatred. With a heart filled with hatred. And then brush it all off with a smile. I was fed up all that. Its around that time. I met Vinu. A good friend I lost long back And some great day where I felt alive. It was like I got it all back. It was like I got it all back. I didn't say anything about me to Vinu, not to cheat him. I never wanted him to change the way he looked at me. But now I know. Something that isn't true never lasts. I won't trouble Vinu anymore with this. Are you this Vinu? To attack the girls house and try to kidnap her after leaving her on the road? Aren't you ashamed? No. Huh? You don't? Sir. We just went through a fight. That's why all that happened. Fight? You didn't mention nursery when you said you were old friends. Sir, not that. Sir, not that. Whatever you say. It is all my fault. But. But I don't wish to lose her for that. Now my parents are interested in this relation. Are you telling us some kind of riddle? Are you telling us some kind of riddle? Sir.
