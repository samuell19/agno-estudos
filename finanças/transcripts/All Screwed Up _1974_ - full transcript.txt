- Sorry. - How dare you? That's so rude! He didn't do it on purpose. I said I was sorry. She's not normal. She's a hick, a Southerner. - Let's get out of here. - Wait. Can't you see she's crying? Listen, he said he was sorry. Do you want him to get on his knees? It's not you. My cousin Isotta Carmela was supposed to pick me up here. My cousin Isotta Carmela was supposed to pick me up right here. If she doesn't show up, what am I going to do? Poor me! Calm down. Don't get upset. We'll help you find her. She's probably waiting here somewhere. Carmela! - Miss Carmela! - Isotta. Her name is Carmela, but we all call her Isotta. - Why? - Just because. - I liked Carmela better. - So did I. Isotta! Miss Isotta! If you're here, answer us! Miss Isotta, please, where are you? Isotta! Miss Isotta! Is there anyone named Isotta here? Please, Isotta! - Is there an Isotta here? - Are you looking for me? - Isotta! - Adelina! Isottina! - Is that really you? - Don't you recognize me? - I thought you were a man. - Come on! - Really! - What are you saying? Isottina, how you've changed! You look just like a lady. - Actually, like a gentleman. - Taxi! ALL SCREWED UP - Wow. Who are they? - Rich people. Watch out! Are you crazy? - You crashed right into us! - Perfect aim, right? You were hoping to avoid the Terror of the Metropolis, but I caught you both. I'll knock your teeth out! - Terror of the Metropolis, my ass! - Come on. You're hilarious. Come on! - You think you're funny? - Okay, I'm sorry! I'll pay for the damages. - It was my fault. - Of course, it was your fault. You crashed right into us. We got hurt. Everyone saw it! - Come on, damn it! - That guy saw it too. You, with the bicycle, excuse me. You saw it, right? That guy just ran us over. - You're our witness, right? - Witness? I didn't see anything. - What do you mean? - Excuse me. - Why? Come back. - Don't be mean. Leave him alone. Can't you see he's completely stoned on love? Besides, you don't need him. I acknowledge my guilt. You want me to pay for the damages? I'll give you my scooter. - There's no need to go overboard. - I'm not going overboard. - You shouldn't trouble yourself. - It's no trouble at all. It was my fault, so here. Take it. Besides, that's just who I am. I'm happy to give you the scooter. - You're being a little too kind. - Don't be silly. You should pay for your mistakes. It was my fault, so I'll pay. Who cares? Just take the scooter. This scooter is worth at least 100,000 lire. Just so I don't lose too much money, slip me 20,000 if you have it. - Are you joking? - Of course not. Then we'll be even. - It's this year's model. - That's great. There's half a tank of gas already. It's only fair. If you break it, you pay. I paid, and good luck to you. - You're too kind, really. - You're really fantastic. - But what will you do now? - I'll take the tram. - Wait. We'll drive you. - No, really. - We feel bad. - You shouldn't feel bad. The scooter's not mine anyway. I stole it! - No, get off the tram. - Unbelievable. - Quick, get on. - Hold on. Hurry, he's getting away! This thing is too slow! Serves you right, dumbasses! - Get off the tram! - Slow down. Watch out for the cars. Careful. Watch out. Screw you! You swindler! If I catch you, I'll cut you to shreds! Dream on! Thief! That bastard! If I'd caught him, I'm telling you, I might've killed him. - Forget it. Let's take it to the police. - No way! I'm not going to look like a fool. No way I'm taking it to the police. I'm keeping the scooter, even if it's stolen. - Gigi, are you crazy? - I don't care. You may not care, but I do. It's stolen, and that's that. What does it matter? Besides, there's no license plate. - Come on. Get on. - No way. I won't ride on that. - Get on. - No. - Don't be stupid. - No. See you Friday. - Bye, Anna Rosa. - Bye, Biki. Living large, eh? - What is it? You having trouble? - I don't have much experience. Look. It's easy. Push this thing in, turn the knob, open the door, put the laundry in here. You close it like this. Good. Put the token in here, and start it. - It's nothing. - Thank you, ma'am. Don't mention it. Did the Biraghis send you? Wait, I get it. You're Isotta's cousin, the girl from Sicily. - You know my cousin? - Sure, she was with me for two years. - She was your maid? - My maid? We were both maids. We shared a room. I feel so silly. You look like a real lady. And why not? Ours is a privileged line of work. In one year, with no expenses, you can save up to 1.5 million lire. Plus, we live in style. A television, modern appliances. - Where does Isotta work? - I don't know. For rich people. Hungry, hungry- Hungry, hungry- What are you two doing here? I'm talking to you. Move along. First of all, use this familiar tone only with your sister, please. - Have I made myself clear? - Okay. - But you're bothering the clientele. - We are bothering them? We, who are starving to death, are disturbing them? We're bothering you? It's you who are bothering us with all this stuff in the window. It makes me so hungry. Do you believe this guy? We're bothering him. Now I'll lie down and die of starvation, and then we'll see if I'm bothering you. Oh, go to hell! Hungry, hungry- I never would have thought there'd be so many cows in Milan. Here we'll get bellyfuls of meat. - We'll all be stuffed. - We'll end up getting gout. I told you, everyone's rich here. Everyone except us, damn it. - Stop working! - Are you talking to us? What are we supposed to do? - Let's go. We're marching. - If there's a march, let's march. - Let's go. - Stop working! We're on strike! OSVA WANTS TO BUILD THIS ACROSS THE STREET. WE SAY NO! CITIZENS, DO WE WANT TO BE MICE FOREVER? DOWN WITH SMOG HURRAH FOR NATURE LET'S CHASE THE LANDLORDS INTO THE BASEMENTS FAILED FACTORY THE REVOLUTION DOES ITS WORK METHODICALLY - K. MARX WHAT TIMES WE LIVE IN, THAT WE HAVE TIME TO PAINT Comrades, let's all join together. Green equals life! Hurrah for green! Agnelli is a bastard! - What does Agnelli have to do with it? - Nothing. But Agnelli's always a bastard. Listen. We don't have a lot of experience. It's our first day of work. We're country folk. - Where are we going? - To City Hall. This time we're going to occupy it, and no one is going to kick us out! - I like fistfights. I do it for fun. - Carletto, things could get rough. Look at that. Wanna bet we're the ones who end up in jail? The police are bastards! - The police are bastards! - What are they doing? Hey, is that a bomb? - These guys are beating us! - We have nothing to do with this. - We have nothing to do with this! - Damn it! - We have nothing to do with this! - Hey, you're going to poke my eye out! - I told you we'd end up in jail. - We didn't do anything. - We're innocent, you know? - We're all innocent here. Look at these two. It's like they're fresh out of a hen's ass! - They're going to put us in jail. - Don't bust our balls. - We'll all be out in half an hour. - You mean they'll let us go? Of course. Give me a cigarette. Sure they will. If they kept all the protesters in Italy in prison, can you imagine? They'd have to put a fence up around the entire peninsula. - You're sure they'll let us go? - Of course. You bet! I really don't want to be locked up tomorrow. - This guy and I have dates. - Let's hope so! We'll see the boss together. - What does mine look like? - I don't know. We haven't met her. - Where are the girls? - Let's just hope for the best. There they are. Carletto! Carletto, come on! - Where shall we go? - What are we waiting for? - Let's pick something. It's getting late. - Let's go see The Decameron. - They say it's good. - I've heard it's pornographic. Isn't he the guy from the other day? The Southern hick with the bicycle. - Hey, Fidel Castro. - Is that your girlfriend? - Who are you? - We met two days ago. Don't you remember the accident? You were staring at that girl. - Hello, miss! - Don't clown around. These things are delicate and extremely private. It's not funny, please. With that long face, you'll make her sad. - Girls want to have fun. - Listen to me. Take her dancing. - I would never dare. - Big mistake. - Maybe I should dare. - Of course, you should dare. - But she doesn't even know me. - We'll take care of that. - Stay here. - Please, come back! Miss. Miss! Miss, listen. Come outside. Do you see our friend, the one with the mustache over there? Be nice. Can we spend the afternoon together? A little prayer? Help, help! Oh, God! Hey, Adelina! Scary, isn't it? - Please, I need help. - I'm coming! Scared, huh? May I introduce Miss - It's just the excitement. Be brave. Why are you so stuck up? - Do you have a special model? - Extra special. My model's like a bear trap. It'll cut you to shreds. - Well, I could - - How dare you? Come on. You idiot! You don't know what you're missing! Scaredy cat! Hey, you look like you're straight out of the depths of Africa. Right, and we prefer blondes! - Gourmand - What does that mean? - It's French for glutton. - You're bilingual. I'm sorry, miss, I'm a beginner. But I'm honored to - So now I work by the hour. I make more, and I work less. There are a lot of expenses, but Biki has had a fantastic idea. I wanted to talk to you about it, because you're the only people we know in this town. She says we should all live in one house and share the expenses. Biki is a great girl. She's extraordinary, smart, confident and modern, right? Oh, sure. - Would you be interested in living with us? - You bet! We could save a lot. Of course, we're in. - Biki is looking for an apartment. - That would be great. We work like dogs, but we never have a dime. - This city is hell. - Oh, God, I can't get used to it. So much noise and confusion. - You see, I'm a country girl. - I'm a country boy, for that matter. I'm going to demolish you. Shit. What are they doing back there? They're behaving so strangely. No, nothing. Gigi is a bit of a scoundrel, that's all. Listen... if that's why you're holding me like this, I'll let it slide. Otherwise, I might even take offense, okay? Why would you take offense? Because it's no way to behave, without even the declaration. Where I come from, a man has to declare himself to a girl. If you have any intentions... I have certain intentions, but I don't know about any declaration. I could declare my taxable earnings. Come on. Don't feel insulted. It's just that I don't know what to say. A declaration is important to a girl. Sometimes it can last a lifetime. For instance, girls who get engaged and then married can only ever have one declaration. It's very important. - You're making fun of me. - No, I'm not. It's just that talking... I'm not used to it. It's really not my thing. I don't know. What can I say? I don't know what to say. What do you want me to say? - What should I say? - I don't know. Something about me. What do you like about me? Well... You're making me feel like an idiot. You're making fun of me, aren't you? There. For example, I like how you cover your mouth when you laugh, just like children do. And also how you cry desperately like you did at the station, sitting on your suitcases. Things like that. - I like that you're such a shorty. - You're saying I'm a midget. No! You're so cute and little, with those big eyes and black curls. All alone in this big city. Well... I want to protect you, that's all. You must be made of stone. No, you should really wait for my answer. Right, now I have to fill out a form. Well... Yes. I mean, you shouldn't get mad, because the answer is yes. Go on, Carletto! Time for action! You're so rude. Go to hell! I'm sorry. He's such an animal. - Forgive him. - Don't worry. There's no danger anyway, because from here down, I'm made of stone. - And that's all there is to it. - I knew it! Of course! A hundred percent, I was absolutely certain. Because when I like a girl, you can bet your life she won't give it up. Because you like virtuous girls. No. It's that I'm a total loser. I never get laid, damn it. Oh, well. Tell me more about Biki's apartment then. Biki might have found a wonderful apartment. In the middle of the sprawling metropolis, amid the jungle of skyscrapers, there's a little apartment building that's a real dream. It used to belong to a painter friend of mine, an eccentric. He specialized in painting ceramic statues. He only did Snow White and the Seven Dwarves. Well, this delightful apartment is miraculously available. Fortunately, a tragedy has occurred. The painter threw himself off the building. He jumped off the terrace. He was holding Snow White. Not that one, of course. Love or neurosis? It's unclear, but the apartment is free. It's a real bargain, even though it's run down. It's spacious, centrally located. We each get a room. We share expenses. We save money, time and everything. We can make a commune. It's all the rage at the moment. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfettes! They're well organized. Biki is really smart. The girls really know how to navigate the city. They work two hours here, two there, they make a pile of money, and they still have time to find a home and organize the whole thing. They're real go-getters, these girls. Poor devil. - Who? - The painter. With all this cement surrounding him, if he wanted to see a tree, he had to paint it on the wall. It's like La Bohéme here. This is a fantastic idea. - We really have everything here. - Shall we set down the rules? In the house, between housemates, nothing doing. It's all over. Worse than brother and sister, okay? - What do you mean? - Otherwise, it would turn into a brothel. It's going to be a respectable home. So forget it ever happened. But if you want to use your room to entertain company, you can pay a supplement. For 15,000 lire a month, you can bring girls home. Great. Clear guidelines make for a long friendship. I'll pay. Come here, you. I'm a gentleman, you know. Have I made myself clear? And never try that again. This is a commune of workers. Now you're going to turn ugly. You already look a bit like Brezhnev. Hey! - Who are you? Dracula? - I'm the cousin. - Of Dracula? - No, of Anna Rosa. Oh, in that case. There must be a factory down in Sicily, because they all look alike. It's like they came from the same mold. - What a wonderful bed. - Gigi, you're a bit too frisky. Anna Rosa! All these men in the house? Don't worry. Don't be so Sicilian. This penthouse is so nice, and the kitchen is adorable. We can put the stove here. There's already an exhaust pipe. Anna Rosa. What did the black widow decide? - Who? - Your cousin. - Is she staying with us? - Yes, she's decided to stay. Besides, she doesn't know anyone in Milan. She just got here from Sicily, where she was recently disappointed. She tried to kill her fiancé in order to defend her honor. - No way. - Yes! But the gun didn't go off. You laugh, but she was so upset, poor thing. - Carletto. - What? Come and see. This is the wash room, but the painter used it as a studio and a greenhouse. It's so nice. Very artistic, right? Look at my childhood friend, a blade of grass. What a place. - Do you like it? - Sure, look at the view. We can see tons of workers. - What are you looking at? - Nothing. Your skirt is a mini mini. Should I be the only one in a long skirt? Then everyone would look at me. But by trying to blend in, you might end up like Biki. She barely even covers her front parts. You can almost see her carpeting, her little garden, respectfully. It's the fashion. Do you want me to look like a peasant? What's wrong with peasants? You should look at yourself. You're all dirty. Now that we're here, don't worry. I'll wash your clothes. For 150 lire a day, you can forget all about it. 150 lire a day? Laundry service. It's a bargain. Biki has it all worked out: laundry, food, overtime, expenses. You'll see how much we can save. In my hometown, the fruit looks very different on the trees. There are small ones, big ones. I just don't get the fruit here. Have you noticed? They're all exactly the same. How do they get them to do that? They make them in the Pirelli factory. They're made of plastic. - Maserati, Ferrari - - Ferrari, Maserati! They're great, sure, but right now, I think there's no car that has the class of the De Tomaso. - What's a De Tomaso? - It's a beast! Four mufflers, and the tires just eat up the road, I tell you. Well, the best car in the world is the Alfetta. Mark my words. Okay, the Alfa, but right now no one can beat the De Tomaso. Good evening. - It was an accident. - That's right. No kidding. - If we may... - My compliments. Unfortunately, faced with the facts, her family is against us. My family is up in arms because I got screwed by a Southerner. No, don't say that, my love. Tomorrow we're getting married. - In that case... - In any case, congratulations. You should be saying, “Condolences.” I was an apprentice window dresser. I didn't even get severance pay. - That's true. - We're in really big trouble. Due to our extremely precarious situation, we'll impose on your kindness for a week or two, just until we get back on our feet. There's only room in the wash room, and you'll have to make do. It's 10,000 a week plus expenses. - For now, it's a decent solution. - How wonderful! Hey, you can't be in here! I'm not bothering anyone. - I have to feed my children. - Hey, are you dozing off? - Thinking about your girlfriend? - No, I'm thinking about shit. - That's nice, right before lunch! - Maybe he's constipated. In the morning, I'm very nervous. Don't worry about it. At first, I was like that too. - But you'll get used to living up north. - I miss the sea. Who has time to think of the sea? - Good morning. - Good morning. That damn alarm clock. Are you gonna turn it off? Please, let Mariuccia sleep a little. She's not feeling too good. You're telling me? I'm gone every day from dawn to dusk. The bathroom is free. Quick, quick! - It was our turn first. Damn it. - Please, Gigi. - Come on, Gigi, don't screw me again. - Open the door. - I have to get to work early. - You snooze, you lose! What a son of a bitch. Oh, well. I guess that means I'll take a bath tonight. The dirt on my body will be preserved in the freezer. - Don't use all the hot water. - Lighter, thanks! Now you're going to smoke in there! They always beat me to the punch. Everyone's always running, running. What a drag. You're all in such a hurry. Speaking of which, Carletto, please call Mrs. Penzotti and tell her that I'm going to be 15 minutes late. - The number? - It's on the wall. Penzotti, with a Look it up under Let me run. Let me run. Let me zip out of here. The foot traffic is crazy here. Honestly, Carletto, you still don't know how to make a telephone call? Go on. Of course, I know how. I just woke up. Excuse me. Hello, Mrs. Penzotti? Ma'am, I'm going to be 15 minutes late. I'm sorry. It can't be helped. She's so annoying. I'm thinking of quitting. - Hey, what's that? - Isn't it beautiful? Finally, we can watch Mike Bongiorno. It's second-hand. We shared the cost, me, Biki, Anna Rosa and Gesuina. You guys can watch it too in the evenings. - You just pay us 100 lire. - 100 lire? Great. First the washing machine, now the TV. 50 lire here, 100 there. It's a wonderful system. - Is there any coffee? - Yes, honey, it's nice and hot. Don't forget the 50 lire. The 50 lire! Of course, I won't forget. Okay, I'm all paid up! You girls don't miss a thing. It's convenient for you too, though. You have everything you need. Why? Aren't you happy? Of course, everything's fine. You're always working. Let me see those big eyes. Silly boy. - Go on. I'm already late. - Okay. I'm just afraid you're becoming too sophisticated. You work, you telephone, you make piles of money. After all, what does a man dream about? Some day, you and I will have a place all to ourselves. And I'd like to buy you a TV, a washing machine, all that stuff. But you've already bought it all. Don't worry. There are tons of things to buy. You worry about finding a good job. They say there's no future at the produce market. And with you? Is there a future with you? Darn it. Do you realize that since we got here, I haven't even been able to touch you? You're worse than a cloistered nun. Damn it. You know how I feel about these things. I'm Sicilian. “I'm Sicilian.” You're something else. I really don't get it. When it comes to everything else, the money, the TV, the miniskirts, you've become Milanese. But “down there” you're still Sicilian. - It's not fair, damn it. - Oh, well. I'm a man like all the others. I'm flesh and blood and all that. Watch out, or I'll bring girls to my room like Gigi. Try it, and I'll shoot you. So you do care. What's this? You've gone to town with the lingerie. Black stockings, very sexy. Come here, you. Are you trying to give me a nervous breakdown, Adelina? Shall we take a leap of faith? Let's get married. How can we get married if you boys can't even pay your share here? The girls have turned into piranhas. They're three bloodsuckers. 100 lire to wash our underpants, 50 for a cup of coffee. Any minute now, they'll start charging 16 lire every time we use the toilet paper. The minute we get home, they skin us alive. But it's worse in other places. At least we have everything we need. I wish they would let us stay after the baby is born. Who knows where we'll end up? - Boy, it's really freezing here. - It's 10 below out here. Inside the freezer, it goes down to 20 below. - You might as well move to Moscow. - It's not the cold that's bad for you. It's going from cold to hot or from hot to cold that's dangerous. Here we go from 20 below to 10 above every five minutes. At least they pay you well. How much do you make a month? 180,000 lire. It's enough for just the two of us. Later, we'll see. Hey, Carletto, what happened? Are you mesmerized? These raspberries are beautiful. - And all these animals! - Beautiful, aren't they? They slaughtered them seven or eight months ago. - Really? - In here, they can last for years. Then, when we need them, we pull them out again. You see this goat? It's Chinese! Really? It died in '71, and they might feed it to us in '77. Sure, because this place is special. Everything is preserved in here. One of these days, I might even preserve my mother-in-law in here. This friend of mine, Mr. Director, would like to work here with us. If you could find a job for him, he's a really good guy. I can vouch for him myself. - If you could find something - - No, he's already caught a cold. He's not suited for this kind of work. Is the pizzeria busy here? Are you kidding? We make 2,000 pizzas a day. Can I help you? - Destiny has thrown us together. - Destiny belongs at the opera house. Who put this pig's head here? You animals! Look at this hair. He looks like Mary Magdalene. - Okay, okay. I'll tie it back. - Or you'll make curly-haired pizza. Today he's really nervous. If I find this disgusting thing on my counter again, there'll be trouble! - Milan lost again, yesterday. - Thank you so much for the update. I know already! I don't need you to tell me! Hey! Alberto, there's too much talking. Everybody quiet! The owner, she's coming! What a sack of bones she is. She's a mummified remnant of the war. The Generaless, damn it. Even in a wheelchair, she still makes the rounds to increase production. The worst part is that she gives all her money to the fucking fascists. All in memory of the late fucking fascist general, her husband, infamous member of the colonizing invaders of Ethiopia. - Hey, Black Beauty, are you a virgin? - The Virgin Mary was a virgin. Hey, that's my fiancée. Even if at first sight, she may seem like a bit of a slut, she's being watched. Soon she'll be my wife, so hands off, or I'll cream you. - Of course. Forewarned is forearmed. - Yeah, right. It's just that she looks like a girl I used to know. What do you want? Leave me alone. I have work to do. Come here. Me, I go to the movies every night. Yeah, to moon over Mastroianni. It's fine with me if they want to watch Mastroianni, as long as everything else is made available to us laborers. Dream on. Nothing doing around here. - Speak for yourself! - Right! All I need is a book with sexy masturbation photos, and off I go! I worked for a very rich family for three years. Such a refined atmosphere. There were two of us. They called us the Kessler Twins, just like those two ballerinas on TV. Let's go dancing! Here come the paranoid obsessives. - About yesterday's game - - Never talk to me about soccer again. - Excuse me. - I just wanted to say that Anastasi said hi. You can stop making jokes, Piedmont, because you stole that game. You always have an excuse when Milan loses. What excuse? This guy comes over with his eyes all bugged out, and then he says, “Anastasi said hi.” What should I say? “Thank you very kindly. You send my regards to that cuckold, the referee.” - Excuses! - I'm not making excuses. - The referee is a cuckold! - The referee has nothing to do with it. - We're tigers on the field. - Tigers? You're kittens. Stop making fun of me! Hey, ladies! What about Carletto? He found a job in a big restaurant. It's right around the corner. He wasn't making enough at the market. - It's his first day. - Really? - They pay well. - He seems like a nice young man. - But living under the same roof... - There's no danger. - What's going on? - Enough! - Don't bust my balls. - Enough! I can't take it anymore! I can't take it! It's just too much. I can't stand it! I will, I’ll jump! And I'll take the children with me! Come on. Stop it. Those are my underpants, damn it! - Oh, shut up, you imbecile! - Stop yelling, damn it. She sounds like Maria Callas. - They married so young. - They shouldn't have. That's easy to say. But what do young people know of life's disappointments? What a prison. Two rooms with two children. It's enough to drive you crazy. What love could survive? Fists are flying over there. That's love for you. - He's the one who gets beaten up. - Really? No, no. When I look at these huge apartment buildings, I think of all the people sentenced to life living in these cells. When I read in the papers that people have killed themselves, I'm not surprised. - I want to become a faggot! - Go right ahead. - Great solution. - I'm going to become a faggot! Holy Mother, it's true! The eviction people are here. They want to evict us and build luxury apartments here. I don't give a damn! It's no use trying to evict us. We're not leaving! We're not moving! We've formed a neighborhood committee against the exploiters, and we're not going anywhere! Tell that to the owners, those stinking speculators and developers, exploiters of the people. We're not leaving! We're not leaving! Two Milano. Hurry! And you, I need veal chops and sausages, now! - I'm coming! - Hurry up! - Calm down, people! - We need the meat, now! I have to cut it first! Do you expect me to pull it out of my ass? Are my pizza capricciosas ready? - Darling, can I have my pizza napoletanas? - Yes, my love. - Here are your napoletanas. - Bye! Excuse me, I need - - Young man... - Of course, I'll serve you too. You're so annoying. Can I pick up - The napoletanas are ready. Hey, leave those there. It's up to me to serve you. You have to ask me first. I was trying not to disturb you. I saw you had a line. I thought I would take them because there was a line. Line or no line, you have to wait, and don't you dare take them. What do you mean, “dare?” I'm a very refined person. Actually, I don't know who you are. I'm a cook, and you're a waitress. In the dining room, you can do whatever you want. But not here! You must have patience, ma'am. Listen, young man, I refuse to speak to that boorish man. I beg your pardon. I'm taking my pizzas, and I'm leaving with them. No, you'll make him angry. God damn it! Stop right there. Give me back those pizzas. I hand them out! Don't you dare! - Have you lost your mind? - What language! That woman! This is my space, and I'm in charge here! - You shitty Piedmontese. - What? You shitty Piedmontese. Bruno! - Say that again! - You shitty Piedmontese! Wait! Calm down! Back to work! I'm so tired. Oh, Lord. I wonder how many pizzas we made? Thousands. At least 1,500 pizzas. Christ, you had to screw us with the pizzas. Pizzas or no pizzas, we're all screwed the same. We could die here. This place is unfit for human beings. For 200,000 lire a month plus a quarter of the tips! Why are you dumping on this place? It's not like other places are better. They're all the same. People, noise, the stench of fried food, and assholes to go around. He's right. This place is better than many others. Besides, 200,000 lire plus tips is a heck of a lot of money. - You can do a lot with it. - Like what? - For starters, you can get a house. - You already have a house, so why bother? No, one of my own. Not that hotel where we live now. - A house of my own. - Why, do you want to get married? - Why? What if I did? - Go on. - Carletto, where are you going? - To make a phone call. It's hellish out there! - Can I wear your raincoat? - It's pouring! Are you gonna let Adelina screw you? She wants to tie you down. What do you care? Are you going to marry Adelina? Well, then. - He's capable of doing something stupid. - With that face, he really could. Carletto, if you get married, you'll be dead to me. Whoever gets married is an asshole. What's gotten into him? 'Cause I doubt he's doing it for love. It's fear. Because ever since we came to the city, we've been scared. - Why? Would a wife take the fear away? - A wife would make it worse. Those with a wife don't want one, and those without are looking for one. - Go figure. - He's an idiot. If he gets married, he'll never see me again. Never trust a friend. It's just that we've been friends since we were children in the parish, at Don Vincenzo's in San Rocco. He was an orphan. I was almost an orphan. - I don't want him to make a mistake. - Come on. You know how it is. Pussy has more pull than a tractor. - Hello? - Hello! I have a ton of money. I'm a billionaire, Adelona! With 200,000 a month plus tips, I'll easily reach 300,000. - Get out the matching bra and panties. - What are you talking about? Don't you get it? Palermo, wake up! We're getting married! Will you marry me? - When, right now? - Right away, of course. Tomorrow, the day after. Not Saturday, 'cause I'm busy. What are you saying, Carletto? Get married right away? To tell you the truth, I think it's anti-economical. - You think it's what? - Anti-economical. What do you mean, anti-economical? Damn it, damn it, damn it! Adelina, between the two of us we're making half a million a month. Carletto, do the math. About 100,000 for rent, about 200,000 for food, clothing, gas, telephone. Factor in installments and other payments, all we need is a child or an illness, and we'd be destitute. Worse than Sante and Mariuccia. This way, we set aside 150 or 200 a month, and in 10 years, maybe we open a store. We're so young. We are young, but I don't want to get married when I'm old. I love you, God damn it. It can't always be about money, Adelina. Have you ever seen half a million, one bill on top of the other? I haven't. Besides, what more do we need? We have everything. A house, food, clothing. I even have two suits. We lack nothing. Adelina, we're set! You think you're all set. Just look around you. The shops, the commercials, Carrousel! Look around you. You'll realize that there are things you need that you'd never have dreamed you needed. Would you ever have thought you needed a leather wallet? Or a picnic outfit? Or perhaps a plastic bouquet of flowers? But you do need them. Women are crazy. We all know that. On top of that, yours is a hick. Get out while you still can. - Or are you a slave of love? - Get out of here. You get out of here. I'm going to the unemployment office. Well, I'll be. So you didn't call the cops. You kept it for yourself. Good for you. Well, one has to adapt, you know. My compliments on your bike. - Wanna go for a ride? - I'd love to. - Here. - So, I gave you a bit of a thrill. Did you like it? Would you like to buy one? I wish. Are you kidding? I can't, not with my job. So that's why you look so run down and underweight. You're working. I don't get it. Don't you know work is for the birds? Those who are rich don't do anything, and those who work are always broke. Take off your helmet. The war's over. Take a bite out of life. Life is an open window. - You wanna make a Michele? - What? - A Michelangelo. - I don't get it. - A rosé. - What's that? Oh, boy, you're so green. - 10,000 lire! - I wish. I'm taking you on an adventure. Hop on. Let's go. Careful with the package. Guess what's in it. - What? - Shit! Hey, don't rush it! It has to be a meticulous job. I even got you the small brushes, so you could reach every little gear. Cylinders, distributor, belts, shocks. Everything, everything. Millimeter by millimeter, everything must be very accurately... covered in shit. - Hey, Walter. - Yes? - Come here a minute. - What a stench. What? - Who's he? - He's a friend of mine. - I'll vouch for him. Don't worry. - Watch out. So, how are we doing? Everywhere, okay? It has to be perfect, meticulous. Walter, no, the pedals, the knobs, the heating, everything. When I say that, I mean millimeter by millimeter. We're not here to play around. For two years, every night in jail, I only managed to fall asleep by thinking of this moment. Because now we're going to lock everything up tight. It'll take at least a week for anyone to find it on this heap of garbage. And when, after a week, all this shit has fermented and has penetrated into all the gears, then, our dear Chief of Police will have the car he deserves. Everyone will make fun of him. “S H" They're going to call him as in “shit.” There's two of them! They're twins! - Two? - There's two of them! - Two! - What's wrong? Are you ill? Two? Come on. Buck up! - These Southerners always overdo it. - Two birds with one rock-hard stone! - Very funny. - You've got a dirty mouth! Two? My babies! Two! My babies! - See how happy he is? - So selfish. There, there. Don't worry, my angel. I'll work harder than a dog, but I'll manage. I'll manage. Don't worry. Yes, you Southerner. You won't get me again. From now on, pills. Pills for lunch and dinner. Shut up, damn it. You're really pathetic. Shut up! - Come on. Come with us. - Go screw yourself! He doesn't want to come. - No? - No. He doesn't want to come. We've lost Tarzan, the spider of the Dolomites, my friend. He got married, he's become bourgeois, he got a job. He's become honest, the big fat son of a bitch. Who are you? Quit playing around. We're professionals here. We take our work seriously. Well? What can I tell you? He doesn't want to come. We could use... I don't know about Walter's friend. - If you want to try me... - He doesn't have what it takes. He's a rube. I advise against it. Seriously, I advise against it. - You advise against it? - Yes. He advises against it. You must be patient. You know what, Fatso? If you're against it, I have to use him. Because Fatso's a kind of oracle. When he opens his mouth, bullshit always comes out. Come on, Fatso. Get up, you idiot. Why does he always pick on me? It's not your fault, Fatso. It's fate. Spouting bullshit is your mission in life. And you, stop laughing. It's just not fair! So, we're going tomorrow? Tomorrow, tomorrow. Tomorrow, you're going to start living! Come on. Let's go. Tell your friend Gigi, officially, that if he doesn't show up tomorrow, he's fired. It's not his fault if he's sick. Send a doctor to the house. No one has ever fooled us. We won't be sending any doctors. If he's not here tomorrow, he's fired. All right. I'll let him know. Abyssinian hick! Stop calling me a hick! Understood? - It's got to stop. We're sick of it. - I don't need your help. Go call your sister an Abyssinian, all right? Since I don't have any sisters, you can take it up the ass. And even if I did have one, she would have been born up north. Your mother, then, son of a whore. Easy on the whores. That's another line of work where there's been a lot of immigration from the south. You rotten bastard! I want to see your blood! I'll murder you! Have you gone crazy? I'll kill you! Let's hide the knives! Oh, brothers of Italy Italy has awoken The owners are CEOS, and right now they're all stuck in traffic. That's where we come in. The houses of the rich are ripe for the picking. - But in broad daylight? - Why? Do you want to do it at night? Times have changed. We keep decent hours now. Nights are for sleeping, or maybe... - I don't get it. - Don't worry. We have informers. There's only one occupied building. Wait till you see how organized we are. We know everything. We get it all from the maids. See the boss? Fatso, go stand guard. Hurry up! Wow! Who are these people? We're live from the match between England and San Giovanni. The referee is Death Warmed over. The linesmen are Peppe Ancuenta from Positano and Fatso Sforza from Gorgonzola. England, John Xyzzz passes the ball to the wing. Loff holds off Fetecchia. Now it's Pompidou. Peppe the cripple, Peppe Accanta, Antonio Midthigh, Peppe Ancuenta and Toto' Lostuolo. Now the ball goes to Skin'n'bones. Skin'n'bones advances, loses a bone. Canevacchi recovers the ball. He's in the penalty area. They trip him. Vacco's head is mistaken for the ball and kicked. Fell'nlove, then Still'nlove takes the ball and advances toward the goal! The ball is back in play. Loff advances and kicks it back. Pompidou recovers the ball and passes it to Midthigh. Goal! Motherfucker! Are we playing games? This is a burglary, all right? I wanted to see what I looked like on TV, boss. See? You look great too. - I just wanted to see what it would feel like. - So you had to play the sportscaster, asshole? Take the stocking off. It's not a robbery. It's a burglary! Look who I have to work with. They're worse than children. Get out of the way, idiot. This is bullshit. Silver, paintings, radios, watches, got it? Clean them out and leave. Let's move. Look alive. Let's go. - Whiskers, you come with me. - Me? Is he talking to me? - Do I have to go out on the balcony? - Hurry. This is your break. Go on! Hurry up! Come on. Hurry up. Turn on the light. I can't see a thing. The light. The light. Where are you looking? By the window? It's by the door! Wake up! What are you doing? Just watching me like an idiot? Go to the next room. I'll take care of this one. Mr. Fumagalli, lawyer. What do you keep in your desk? Pills, string, rubber bands. Come on. Where do you keep your money? What's going on? What's he doing? What the hell are you doing? Go to the bedroom. Jewelry, watches, radios, televisions, small objects. Get going. Be quiet. I can't believe the idiots I have to work with. What, are we cleaning up now? Poor people, I just thought it was rude. They're so tidy. Fuck you! - Stop right there, asshole. - My pants! That way is blocked. We can't get out. - You ripped my pants! Damn it! - Come here. Now we'll have to put on a show. Sit down. Not a word, or I'll kill you. My dear sir, thank you so kindly. You are our guiding light. Good day and all the best. Good-bye. Say good-bye to the lawyer. He's grown attached. He can stay. Good day, sir. Oh, you're coming? - Good-bye. I'll call you. - Good-bye, sir. - Ma'am. - Good morning. - Could you open the elevator for us? - Of course. - We don't know the building well. - Right this way. - Are those bifocal lenses? - Yes. - How do you like them? - Oh, I love them. I'm asking because I really should get some too. - They're wonderful. - Hear that pure Milanese accent? - The elevator's here. Thank you, ma'am. - You're welcome. Behave, or I'll crack your skull. And walk slowly when we get out, or I'll break your back, asshole. Don't run! - Somebody's coming. - Quiet! Help! Thief! - What's going on? - There's been a burglary. Imagine that. - On the fifth floor. - Oh, Lord! Help! Stop them! Help! Thief! I've been robbed! Help! Stop them! Oh, God, my pants! I'll nail you, damn shoe. Yes, but you could have told me you wanted to change jobs and be a sales rep. You left me in the dark. Like an idiot, I had to make excuses for you to the chef. I almost got fired. But you look great. That suit looks expensive. Listen, does it pay well, being a sales rep? It depends. Sometimes things go well and other times, not so much. This time I got lucky. But it's great being your own boss. You go wherever you want. You do whatever you please. - Couldn't I do that too? - No. - Why? Am I an asshole? - No, I mean - It takes initiative. I only just started. Let's wait and see. Maybe later, if things work out for me. Look who's here. - The brunette. - Where is Adelina? Good morning, miss, may I entertain the hope of taking you out to dinner? Sure, you just keep hoping. Tonight? Not tonight. Not ever. Just forget it. It just can't be. You're such a cruel Abyssinian. - You'll make me switch to blondes. - I'm here. Yes, my tasty little morsel has arrived. She's a client. We have to talk business up in my room. - Really? - Excuse me. Be my guest. The tasty morsel. Come here. Tell me something. He's allowed to have girls in his room? He pays a supplement. - Do you pay one as well? - What for? With Adelina, it's been a disaster living here. I can't even lay a finger on her. Marriage is “anti-economical.” If she sees me with a woman, she says she'll shoot me. I don't know what to do. Why is she doing this to me? - You let her do it. - Me? Sure. It's all your own fault. They did everything to convince us to move out of the building. They even offered us money, but we stuck to our guns. The neighborhood committee rejected the eviction and petitioned the City. Let's see if they get the message. It's tough when you have kids. Baby food is so expensive. I'm going to have to find more work. I could fix refrigerators at home, after hours. What else can I do? - Carletto, are you listening? - I'm sorry. It's Adelina. - What's wrong? - I mean, we live here together. She's always in front of me, but she won't... - I'm not a saint, you know. - Carletto, there's a simple solution. Where I come from, we have our own way of solving this problem. It's an ancient remedy. You have to take her by force and commit the impure act. The impure act will fix everything. What are you talking about? - Good night. - Good night. - I'm prepared. “Do not disturb.” - Good night. Pardon. Voila! - Oh, you're here. - I was waiting for you. I worked late. Mrs. Penzotti had a dinner party. - Really? Are you drinking grappa? What a strange expression. What's wrong with you? Nothing. Holy Mother, that Gigi. He's in his room with that blonde. I don't know anything about this sex stuff, but I think people make too much of a fuss. Listen. What's he doing to that girl? It sounds like he's slaughtering a sheep. Yeah. For 15,000 extra, he gets to organize a “reperotte” in his room. Excuse my language, but that means “brothel” in Italian. And he kicks me out. I mean, listen to the ruckus. We can't even have a conversation with that Boccaccio in the other room. But, Adelina, I wanted to talk to you. You see, you've become a city girl. Head on your shoulders. You're quick. You're clever. You work and make money. But in a modern girl like you, there's one note that's off-key. Why are you turning off the lights? What “off-key note?” That one. But... how dare you? You heard me. That one. - A clever girl like you, a virgin? - Oh, God! - It's laughable. - No, Carletto, don't mess around. Please, Carletto, no. Please. Come on. No. - Yes. - No! Yes! No! Scoundrel, coward! No! Hold still. There's no way out of this. - No! - Carletto is awake now. You're through. - Where are you going? - Help! - Stop, - No! No! - No! - This lingerie is so... No scratching! It's no use. I won't let you go. No, Carletto, no. I beseech you. - The others are in the house. - I don't care. Enough is enough. I'm tired of listening to Gigi. For once, he'll have to listen to my Decameron. Aren't you ashamed of yourself? You Zulu, scoundrel, sellout, coward! Who the hell invented these panty hose? Maria Goretti? No, let me go! Oh, God, God, God! Yes, God. Oh, no, let go of that! - Watch out! - Not the television! No! Oh, God. The television is brand new! Watch out for the television. Careful with the TV. It's new. If it falls, it'll break. Hold on to it. Hold on tight. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No! Saint Rosalia! Oh, my God! - What's going on? - Nothing, my love. Why? Why? Why are you doing this awful thing to me, Carletto? Because I love you. - You idiot. - Oh, my God. A score is being settled. Charge, Savoia! Come on, Blondie. It's an orgy! There's a rape in progress. Let's join in the fun! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Now you've calmed down. Holy Mother. You made a big boo-boo. That's right. Why bother with a little boo-boo? Are you cold? Are you cold? Boy, what a struggle. Did I hurt you? A lot? I'm sorry. I'm a fallen woman now. That's right. Finally. I'm willing to make amends. It's up to you. Poor me. What did you do to me? I really don't know what happened. What? You don't know what happened? Well, let me explain it to you again. Watch it. I'll tip the television over again! Execute the eviction. We have the paperwork. Execute the eviction. We're not budging from here! Damn you! You have no mercy even on women and children! Show them the babies. Go on. Hold them up! All of them! Didn't Biki say she wanted to get rid of the children? Yeah, but now they're coming in handy. Down with the landlords! We want housing! Down with the landlords! Who are those guys? Students. They're here to help us. They believe in our cause. We want housing! Down with the landlords! You have to think of your children, of your rights, and of your cause! Accessorized. Minimum consumption, maximum mileage. - Ice white finish, black leather interior. - It's gorgeous. I even joined the Automobile Club. Very high-class, isn't it? How did you afford the down payment? It's called “overtime,” dear. What overtime? What do you mean, Biki That pig, Professor Quinteri. The other day, when his wife was out, he was coming onto me. 30,000 lire for 10 minutes of pain. - Holy Mother! - What Holy Mother? These days, you can't afford to be squeamish. I'm telling you this now that Carletto has serviced you. If you get the chance, take it. - We did it! - We did it! Come outside! We did it! - The City bought the building! - Holy Mother! They're going to renovate! - Our rents will stay the same. - The same rent! We won! “Twenty-five years of leftist administration in Bologna have set an example.” Wait. “The historical center of town has been restored for the people.” Holy crap! “What happened here today is a historical milestone for Milan.” A historical milestone for Milan! - What's going on? - Mariuccia is feeling ill. - Mariuccia isn't well. - Give her some air. She doesn't feel well. My Mariuccia. - Didn't you take your pills? - Yes, I did. But with all our worries, I might have made a mistake. - Let's hope not. - Oh, Lord. Let's hope not. My word, Sante! Five! You two could repopulate the desert! - You do have a tiger under the hood. - Five! Come on. Buck up. Don't cry. Holy Mother! Five! She'll destroy her insides! Just imagine, Anna Rosa. In Sicily, I shot Carmine because he refused to disgrace me. I could have ended up like her. If he had gone ahead with it, who knows how many children I'd have by now? Five kids in one go! You could make a lot of money in advertising. - Right! With the pill, it's not so unheard of. - It can happen. It does happen. Seven of them, Holy Mother. How can we keep them all here? - Imagine what Biki will say. - She won't tolerate it. Gigi, Carletto, come here. We have to make a decision. There are too many of them to stay here. How can we keep seven of them here? They have to leave. - Have some compassion. - Look at him, poor guy. I know. I feel sorry for him. But he's irresponsible. If I were his wife, I'd cut his thing off. She's right. - He ruined that poor woman. - Yes, but you're going overboard. After all, children are a blessing too. With 200,000 lire a month for nine people? It's enough to kill you. You're all so severe. Listen, Carletto, don't even dream of putting me in that situation. Well, I ruined you. You decide if you want to live in disgrace. You're a scoundrel, but I refuse to do something that's anti-economical. I'd rather be disgraced than stupid. Just listen to her, damn it. My darling baby, don't worry. Your father will feed you all. Somehow he'll manage. He'll manage. Hey, are you going to light that cigarette? Why not? Listen, honey, what are you waiting for out here all alone? Are you looking for company? Why not? Well, then, get in, handsome. Why not? 20,000? All right, 20,000. Come on. - Payment in advance. - That's fine with me. Hey! - Are you joking? - No jokes. I charge 20,000 to fornicate. Me pay you? It's you who has to pay me, you cretinous dolt! Get out of here before I kick you in the ass! You imbecilic Southern hick! There's no need to yell. There's been a misunderstanding. I'll send you straight to jail. You're wasting my time, you fucking idiot! So rude. What about the new job? - Did you start it, Santino? - Yes. - Did it go well? - Not really. But they've promised me another one with the City tomorrow. Keep quiet, or they'll kick us all out. - Did you give Cicciuzzo his medicine? - Yes, of course. Don't worry. Sleep quietly, children. - Did you eat, at least? - Yes, my love, don't worry. Well, that's good. I'm so tired. No, be a good boy. Come on, please. - Not tonight either? - No, love, it's too dangerous. All you have to do is look at me. Come on, love, no. But I love you. - I can take anything, but I love you. - Quiet. No, not this! You can't do this to me, because I can't take it. You can't take this away from me. It's late. Go to bed. - How are you feeling? - A little better. Adelina, will you bring me the hot water bottle? Let me go to bed. I worked all day, and I'm exhausted. - Come on. Gigi's not here. - That's why I won't bring it. - Come on, Adelina. - Be good. No, be patient. Let's not get in any more trouble. Don't you hear those guys in there? We have to be level-headed. Life is no joke. Life! I just don't understand it. Everything is upside down here. At least when you get married, there's a hearth, a home. There are bills to pay. Come on. Let's go to bed. Tomorrow's going to be a busy day. Good night. Oh, my goodness. Tomorrow I have to work almost 10 hours. Work and money. Money and work. Work and money. We have to form a union of our own. You won't listen to me because you're afraid. There are some customers. - Hey! - Hey. - Well? - They don't have money. - Forget them. - Get out of here. We have to form a union. It's time to get rid of the bloodsuckers. Who could touch us then? We would have the last laugh. We would have our own hotels, health insurance, a pension, our own private police, so no one could suck our blood anymore. What are you doing here? You acted all stuck up, with your nose in the air. Well? You're a fool. But I can smell your type a mile away. No one can know about this. Not even Adelina. Do you have any conscience at all? Back home, I have my mother and four brothers. Five poor souls who live off this. If anybody finds out where it comes from, they won't be able to survive anymore. So get out of here. I've got you stuck in my craw, and you know it full well. Maybe it's better this way. I can pay. How much? Ten, 20? - Whatever you want. - No. Not you. There's not money enough for you. Why not, God damn it? That's just the way it is. Go away. Dirty whore! - Mariuccia, come into the other room. - Biki wants to talk to you. This time it would be unforgivable. But today? Right now? Right now, immediately. We don't have a minute to lose. Don't worry about the money. We'll take care of it. You can't go on being irresponsible. Anna Rosa and Gesuina will take care of the children. Sante doesn't know. What he doesn't know can't hurt him. - I can't think about it. - You have to think about it. Look at the state you're living in, with your starving children! When you leave here, you won't be able to feed them! Look how you've let that man ruin you! Look at yourself! You look like an old woman. Come on. Leave the children here, and we'll go with you. In two hours, we'll be back, and it will be behind you. Come on, Mariuccia. Let's go. Have you heard from Isotta? I haven't heard from her in ages. She's disappeared. Back home, her entire family is worried. Who knows where she is? She could give us a call, though. Come with me. Take your coat off. Hurry. Let's go. Don't be afraid. Everything's going to be fine. You go take a walk and come back in fifteen minutes. All these poor people. - Oh, Lord. - Don't dwell on it. Come on. A glass of water. Wait. Wait a minute. I don't feel well. I don't have any money. Wait here for a family member or the doorman, perhaps. Come on. Buck up. Now you'll go home and lie down. You have to go. We're busy here. - What do you want? - Some water. - Is she feeling ill? - No, she’s just a little weak. Now she's going to go home. Come on. The worst is over. I don't feel well. - I'll help her. - But Mariuccia! A little compassion. - Listen, we have work to do. - You should be ashamed! - How dare you? - Shame on you, you parasites! Get out, with your foul mouth! - Our work is of a delicate nature and - - You have to be patient with her. - Who did you bring me? - Bye. Get out of here, and don't come back! - Thank you so much. - It's going to be all right. Thank you, again. Oh, my God, I feel sick. Ma'am, I feel sick. I'm a mother. I have five children. - I was hoping - - Don't worry. Forget about it. I'll take her home. Come with me, ma'am. I'm the idiot here, trying to do favors for others. Go to hell! I'm sorry for Biki, but I'm not going back to those butchers. I know how many poor women die under the knife. Those parasites, murderers. So the government can save face. It's murder. In the end, I don't know who the real murderers are. - Calm down, Mariuccia. - Of course, I'll calm down. I'll calm down and keep this new wretch of a child. He couldn't have found a worse mother, poor thing. Poor Angel Be careful, Sante. Can't you see your lines are all crooked? You're ridiculous. You can't go on like this. Do you want to die? After 10 hours in the freezer, you can't work all night. You can't keep it up. What do you want me to do? Drown my kids like rats? They came into the world. They're here. I have to make it. Back home, seven kids, even if they were starving, the whole town would take care of them. They would all grow up together, in rags, perhaps, stealing fruit in the orchards, fish from the fishermen. But here, in the city, it's different. You can't raise seven kids. Food, clothing, surrounded by other people. It's different! Why don't you go back home then? Why? Because I've heard that even down there everything's changed. I'm scared. The trip is so expensive. I'm scared. No, Carletto, I have to make money. I need money. That's it. I have no more shame. I'll do anything for money, anything. Listen to those kids crying. Even if they're locked in their room, they're really giving me the blues. They have to move out. All the misery in the house makes me sad. By the way, any news? Did we get the apartment? - Did you give them the down payment? - Of course, the receipt's in my room. I'll show it to you. It's already rented for 50,000 lire a month. I did the math. The rent will pay the mortgage, so we won't have to worry about it. As soon as we get rid of Sante and Mariuccia, we'll clean the room, put some nice furniture in, and then you'll see. Girls, let's be honest. If we rent it by the hour, we can make 300,000 a month. - That's for sure. - Holy Mother. - By the hour? - Absolutely. Now that the City is putting in another bathroom, finally we'll pull in some money. This summer, we're going on a cruise! Enough with the daydreaming. It's late, and Mike has already started. Mike! Well? Why the long face? I don't know. Maybe I'm sad because of that poor girl in the other room. Tell me the truth. Is it because of Carletto? Did you tell him the wedding's off? No, at this point, he's figured it out. Don't be stupid. If you worry about other people, you're screwed. Just focus on having a good life, and we will, I promise. It's going to be great! This evening, as you already know, there are some new additions to our game. But I'll let someone else tell you about them. I'll pass the mic over to- - Hi, Sante. - Hi. What are you doing here? Did they offer you a job? - Sort of. - It's not for that fascist, is it? What do you want from me? I have to think of myself. I leave politics up to the rich. Did you know she's pregnant again? Forget about me. Don't say anything. Just let me be. Bye. That was Carletto. He says that Sante might be in trouble with that fascist from the restaurant. He's afraid they might have roped him in to do some political demonstration. They came around here looking for people too. It was for some demonstration. That idiot Sante is so desperate for money with all those kids. I'll go take a look. - What do you think they're planning? - I think it's something crazy. - You mean some crazy stunt? - It could be serious. Did you see how excited the owner's son was? Those fascist pigs don't fool around. They want to prove themselves to the industrialists who finance them and show the CIA that they're serious. A bomb! There's been an explosion! That was a bomb! - What the hell's going on? - They set off a bomb! And Sante? I don't know where he is. We have to find him. - How? In all this confusion? - We'll go look. - If bombs are involved, I'm out. - What? What's wrong with you, Gigi? He's a friend. We have to help him. What kind of person have you become in this shitty city? A thief is what I've become, idiot. Understand? It's full of cops here, and if they catch me, I'll go to jail because I have a record, okay? You go look for that idiot! Get down! Let me go! - Holy Mother of God. - Yes! That guy! Hit them! Take this and get lost. Stop that man! - Let me go! - It's him! - It's your friend. - It's him, it's him! Let me go! Help! Help! Let me go! Help! I had nothing to do with it! Have mercy! Let me go! My babies! My children! - My babies! - Sante! My babies! Come on! Come on! So it's all over? Back to work? You've already digested the whole thing? You couldn't care less about what happened outside. This is what ruins us all. It's this stomach we have. We can digest anything, anything at all, with this stomach. - Bruno, come on. - No, I've had enough. It's enough! I can't take it anymore. It's too much! You coward! Come here! Come with me! Come on, you coward! You're done, you coward! That's enough. Over here. Come over here. Mommy Who will help me? Will anyone help me? - Poor guy. - It was an attack of neurasthenia. - They'll put him in the psych ward. - Better never to set foot in there. He went a bit crazy, but he had tears in his eyes, poor guy. What kind of a life is this? Screwed. We're all screwed. If we keep on working like this, we'll all go crazy. I don't know. Maybe we should all just stop. We should start over somewhere else, in a different way. A different way. We should stop. What's all this? The restaurant is full. People are hungry. Let's move it. Back to work! Back to work! ALL SCREWED UP
