- Where did I find you again? - In your dreams baby. - Am I dreaming now? - I don't know, maybe. - And how do I know if I'm dreaming or not? - I would have to pinch you to find out, wouldn't I? - Pinch me where? - Oh I'm sure I could find somewhere. Stop it! I love you baby. - I've been searching for you my whole life, Esmay. You're the one. - Ready to knock 'em dead honey? - Always. It's about time I went back to work. - Well you haven't got it yet so don't put all your eggs into one basket. - I'll be fine. - A career change is a big thing. Just take it easy, one step at a time. - What are you gonna do for the rest of the day? I don't know if I want to go work right now, you sitting there looking like that. - Oh, okay. - Don't tempt me. - What, you still have energy in you after last night? Oh wait, come sit. - What's this then? - Open it. - Okay. Oh wow, cool. - Do you like it? - I love it. What's it for? - Well just to say thank you. Come here, let me do it. It suits you. Consider it your good luck charm, just like your name, Lucky. - Shit, I better go or I'm gonna be late for this interview. - Okay. - I'm telling you, Lee, I've never been so sure. - If you break my sister's heart, Joe, you know I will kill you. - Yeah, I know. Well, I gotta get her out of that serviced apartment that's for sure. - Coming. I just realized I do need you to get some groceries. - Well we gotta meet up for dinner or something soon I guess. - Sounds good. - Oh fuck. - What exactly are you doing now, Joe? - I'm on my way to a job interview. - God, Esmay has really straightened you out then. Good to hear. - Well I've over being a cop, that's for sure. - Who's this guy? - Don't you fucking touch him, bitches! - Oh shit. I'm such a dick. - What is it? - I've left my portfolio at home. - Well I better let you go then Joe, unlucky. - Ha, ha, ha yeah very funny. - Tell Ishtar to suffer cause I won my man fair and square. And tell her that I found happiness before she did. - Die bitch. Love sucks. - Talk later, bye. - Okay. - Bye. - Yep, bye. Damn it. Honey? - Joseph? Joseph. - Looks like I picked the wrong day to quit drinking. - How are you holding up? - We'd recently been engaged. I hadn't announced it yet. - That's terrible. I'm sorry you'll have to let her go. - Don't know if I can, B. - This case, it goes way deeper than you think. - But why her? - Believe me, you have to let this one go. - Easy for you to say. Did you see the sign they left? - Sign? - Now who do you suppose is responsible for that? - Look, I think forensics are already working on it. - It's familiar to me. - It's not your problem anymore. - I'm gonna find the son of a bitch responsible for this. - No you're not. - Hey! You can't tell me what to do! If you're not gonna help me investigate then I'll fucking do it on my own! - Can you give us a minute, darling? - Hey, she's not going anywhere. She's family. - Your debts have been paid, Joe. You've retired from the force. This is the end. You've got to forget her now. You were supposed to start-- - Start fresh? And I fell in love in the process. And look where that's got me now. - Yeah. - Yeah, that's right. So, are we going to do this? - We? No, this is over my head. No chance. - Even when my blood is concerned? - I'm sorry, Joe, but if you do this you're on your own. In fact, I'm going to confiscate your weapon. - Then I'll get another one. - Where the hell are you gonna start anyway? These people, they swoop in and then they're gone. They're ghosts. You see this? This is signature triad. Why would you want to get involved with someone like Ishtar? It's suicide. - Thanks for that. Ishtar. - I'm gonna leave the both of you now. - Hey! Is there anyone that can help me? - Really? Are you serious? Personally, I think you're past this. Are you even in good enough shape? - I've still got a few tricks up my sleeve. Now come on, I know you know someone that can give me a lead. - I might know one person. But it's a guess and I seriously doubt-- - Who? - Her name is DJ. She's an ex cop who used to work undercover on the job for a while. - How come I've never heard of her? - That's why they call it working undercover. - What's her bio? - She's been retired from the force for some time. Ever since her cover was blown she had to go into hiding. That's all I have. - We cool? - I'm sorry you lost her. - I'm sorry you had to hear all that. - It's okay, I'm a big girl. What's next? - That's a good question. - Do you have anything to report to me today? - Yes, I'm getting there. Okay, Mr. Gosling seems to be on track. We do need to follow up with Mr. Ray though. - Tell me something I don't know. That's why I'm paying you. - We do have one issue however. - Yes? - The Mr. Wong situation. - Wong? I thought we already took care of this? - Yes madam, um, no it appears not. - Bring me Mr. fucking Wong! - Thanks for this. - I should have my fucking head examined. - I really appreciate this, DJ. - The only reason I'm doing this is because I know you've lost your partner. But I gotta tell you, this ain't gonna turn out like you expect judging by your previous experience. - Go on. - This crime syndicate isn't like what I've come across in the past. - What do you mean? - There's this Ishtar. She's a crazed maniac. I mean a real schizoid. Would turn on even her own people on the drop of a hat. - What else? - This bitch has issues about race. I mean she's Chinese and her people are from different Asian backgrounds, but she does not hold back just to remind them of how inferior they are. - Can she fight? - My advice to you is stay retired from the force. Don't go back. - I need a lead. - You need to disappear. At least, that's what I'm doing. - Okay, give me a little bit more. Come on, tell me, how did you blow your cover? - Ishtar! - Mr. Wong. - Business is good, yeah? Come dance. Come on, come on. â™« All you had to do was ask - How quickly. Too quick. - Your singing is as bad as your business. Let this be a lesson to anyone who tries to fuck with me! Get this piece of shit out of my sight. - Hang on, I'm just logging onto this. Is that you? Hey Joseph, is that you son? - Dad. - Ha, there you are. Hey, lucky you caught me, mate. I was just about to head out with a few of the boys. - Yeah, I thought I'd log in now, just on the off chance that you were there. - Yeah, yeah, how are you holding up, mate? - Pretty bad. - Yeah well, I thought as much. It's a bit of a frigging tragedy, mate, hey. - You can say that again. - So what are you going to do, mate? What are you going to do with yourself? - I'm not sure. - Um, have you thought about coming back home? - The thought has crossed my mind. - Look, I'm sure everyone's had a bit of a piss in your ear, mate and it's hard to hear things when people are trying to give you advice, but I'm sure she was really a beautiful girl mate, a lovely girl. But you know what? Time does help, mate. It helps you heal these things, you know? - Any suggestions? - Yeah right. I don't know if you're asking the right bloke, mate. What do you usually do when your relationship ends? - I usually find another one. - Like father like son. Yeah well, I know it's hard and painful but I know you can do it, mate. I really do, I know you can do it. - Oh God. - Look, I know son I know. Joseph, why don't you just get the hell outta there, mate, and just come back to LA? - I got one more score to settle. - Right. Well, I don't like the sound of that. But you're your own man so whatever you do just be careful, all right? Just give me a call, mate if you need anything, okay? - Okay, thanks Dad. - Right, take care. - You all right? Hey! Take you stances. Just nice and easy. One, come on. - Duck! Good, good. Good, and again. - And you are? - Your present. - Looks like an expensive present. - It's already been paid for, darling. You got me the whole night. - But it's not birthday and it's not Christmas. - Darling, we can do anything or nothing you like. Are you saying you don't want any company? - Fucking internet. Did my Dad pay for you? Mr. Lucky, did he order you for me? - Ah yes, yes he did. I believe so. - Can you cook? - No. I mean yes. Anything you want baby. - Maybe you can come in with me for a little while. - Now you're making more sense. I like it. - Okay, maybe you can help me clean. - So are we alone? - Apart from the mice. - You want me to help you clean? - Seriously, did my Dad pay for you? - Does that matter? - Look, you're an attractive girl and everything but I've recently lost somebody. - What was her name? - Esmay. - Call me Esmay then. - What are you reaching for? - What? - What's this tattoo? I asked you a question. Who are you? Fuck you, bitch. You're going to fucking die if you don't tell me where you came from. - Fuck you, gweilo. - Lee, I don't want you to see this. - Is she one of them? - One of what? - What's that? - Not sure, but it doesn't look good. - She tried to kill you? - What the fuck am I going to do now? - Have you got a toolkit in your house? This is going to get messy. - Why do I get the feeling you've done this before? - This is for Esmay, you bitch. - House cleaning? Your name's Joseph, right? - Who wants to know? - I've seen you around. - Why are you asking me all these questions? - I'm just being polite. I'm your neighbor. - I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. - Fucking crazy gweilo. - Who is it? - Is that Ms Onna? - Who wants to know? - My names Joe. I work with DJ. - You're a detective? - No, yes. - Can I see some ID please? - I'm an ex cop. - I can't help you then. - Hang on a second. I just want to ask you some questions about the Ishtar organization. - Listen, I've already been through protective custody. You shouldn't even be here. - Okay, understandable. Trust me, you're safe. It's a favor to me. - You're on the case? God help you because these guys, they're monsters. - I'm just going to ask you a couple of questions and then I'm gone. Is that okay? - Mm, ah. - Put it away, bro. - It's in my fingers. I feel the power! - I said put it away. We have a visitor, hide it. - Fellas. - Anyone see you coming? - No, not that I think so. - Ah, don't think. You should act. - Nobody saw me. Hey. - Hey. - So why are we meeting here anyway? What's wrong with Ishtar? - Don't ask questions. - Okay. I was just-- - I'll ask the fucking questions, man. - All right. - So why are you late on the payments? - Oh come on, you know I'm good for it. I mean, you guys gave me a second chance. - Do we give second chances, bro? - No bro, we don't do seconds. - No, no, no, Ishtar gave me a second chance. - That I'm not so sure of. But this would be your third chance, Ray. - This is bullshit. You know I'm good for this. I mean how long have I been hustling for you guys for? - Do we give third chances, bro? - This is fucking bullshit, okay? I am good for this. Do not treat me like one of your amateurs. - Well, you know what they say. - No mate, I don't know what they say. What do they fucking say? - Three strikes, you're out. - Snap, crackle, pop. - Yeah, work it baby. Mm, nasty booty. - Good evening, Mr. Gosling. - He's going to become deaf if he keeps listening to his music like that. - Can I get you a drink? Cool mask. Where can I get one? - This will conclude our business for today. I will inform Ms Ishtar of Mr. Ray's unfortunate incident. Keep up the good work. Goodnight to you then. I'm off now. I need a full body massage. Too loud. Has anyone tell you that? - What? - Exactly. - Bunch of kill joys. - Who the fuck is that? Bro, where's the other chick gone? - Huh? - Get the fucking door, man. Dude, they're your party girls. You look after them. - Oh for fucks sake. - Bro, wait! - Please! - Shut up, bitch. Get the fuck outta here, it's going to get messy. You tell Ishtar that the gweilo is coming to get her. - Where the fuck are you going? - Who the fuck are you, man? - I'm Mr. Question and you're Mr. Answer. - Uh, uh, uh, uh. I have unfortunate news to report. The Gosling brothers have been attacked and their hideout penetrated. - Are we talking Mr. Raymond? - No, no, no, no, he's been taken care of. I told you that. - Don't, don't correct me. - Sorry, I'm sorry. - Fucking who then? - We're still trying to identify him. Gosling Junior turned off the security camera when trying to have threesome with African girl. - I don't need to hear about that. - Sorry. - I knew that fake shop front wouldn't last. Our cover's been blown. Lasso the black girls and bring me the Goslings. - It seems that Gosling Senior disappeared. Gosling Junior is in a coma. The black girls do not know them, it may take some more time. - Masked avenger. - I'm coming to get you, Ishtar. You stole my world, and now I'm going to destroy yours. - Watch where you're going, you fucking idiot! - Hi, how can I help you? We're not open. - I'm here for Ms Woo. - Hello, may I help you? - I'm hoping so. - I'm sorry, do I know you? Excuse me, are you here for business? This is a secure area. - Is it? - Yes. If you don't state your name or business I will have to call the security. - I don't think that's going to help you very much. - What is this about? Is that real? - You wanna find out? - No, no. - Tell me where Ishtar is. I asked you a question. Tell me where Ishtar is. - Don't know what you're talking about. - Your organization killed my fiance. - No, not me. I-- - You what? - I'm only just working for her. I'm not a bad person. Please. - Yeah, that's what they all say. - No, no, no, what do you want? - Tell me where she is? - Who? - Ishtar! Back up, bitch. - Move! Tell me what I want to know or you're going to die. - Okay, okay, I'll tell you. What do you wanna know? - Keep it to English! - Okay, got it. - Ishtar, where is she? You tell me Ms Ishtar or you're done now. - You'll never get her. They'll kill you white man before you get there. You're finished. - We have a situation at the restaurant. It seems someone threw a hand grenade at the building and in the process killed Ms Woo. - Who the fuck is going to throw a hand grenade? I mean, where is someone gonna get that in this town? What happened to our avenger on site? - Our second was at the scene so we fear that she's also a fatality. I'm still trying to locate the others. - Well maybe you'll try to find your brain too. - I'm trying my best! - Gosling down. Woo down. Avenger down. Who's next? Whatever happened to Ling Ling? - You mean the prostitute? - She's an assassin! - Ah yes, sorry, you mean the assassin disguised as a hooker sometimes. - Where is she? Don't tell me they didn't clean up Esmay's mess. Get me the security camera footage from the restaurant. I think we might have gweilo on our tail. - I eat gweilo for dinner. - Yeah, but I think this one might be an ex cop. - I eat ex cops for dinner. - And for lunch? - Italian stallions. - And breakfast? - Black mambas. - Be careful I don't cut your balls off. - Hey! - Speak of the devil. - I'm surprised. No guns. - We've been expecting you. - Oh? Should I be flattered? - In my company, yes. I should think so. You're standing in the company of the elite. - And in the company of murderers. - Yes, but you'd know all about that wouldn't you. - I must hand it to you though. You're the first gweilo who's gotten this far into my organization. - Wasn't that hard. - Oh really? How so? - I just followed the trail of death and destruction and your sloppy organization. - Awful lot of trouble for just one China doll? Esmay was good, very good. But not my best. She had it coming. - She was my fiance. - She was a thief! She disgraced us. - She was my world. - A world very different to ours it seems. - Who made you judge and jury? - You know nothing of my world. My gods. My power. My rule! Let's just see how good you really are then. Hm, can't even do the splits. - Karate. Japan. - Kung Fu. China. Taekwondo. Korea. - How many styles does this mother fucker know? - Oh God. What now? - Muay Thai. Thailand. - This is a disgrace! - Please, don't kill me. Please don't kill me. I didn't do it. I didn't do it. Please. Please. - Go. - Thank you, thank you. - White meat. Idiots. Must I do everything myself? You all abandoned me! Now feel my wrath, gweilo. Got you now, don't I, fucker? Who's gonna help you this time, huh? Sorry, what's that darling? - The cops are coming. They're on our tail as we-- - Do you think I'm fucking stupid? You're on your own this time, Lucky. You and your little revenge mission. You've gone all lone ranger on us. Everyone knows the cops aren't helping you this time. Christ, you signed your own death warrant. Now just like that little she bitch you're gonna learn that no one fucks with I-S-H-T-A-R! - Now let's just see what Esmay was all worked up about, shall we? Hm, what have we got here? Come on baby, let's make up. Don't worry, you'll forget about her in no time. Your heart says no but your head says yes. I changed my mind. You're not my type. - What are you going to do to me? - Oh, what I do to all my prey. Can the goods. - Ishtar, if you are going to finish me off, if you are, just let me ask you one last thing. - What? - You ah, kind of got me all worked up over here. - Well, I'm not asking you to finish me off, but. - Oh, I am gonna finish you off mother fucker. - Would you permit me just one last kiss? - Are you serious? - Mm-hm. - All right, darling. I'll make your dreams come true. You can call it the kiss of death. You're a cocky little bastard, aren't you? But I like that. - I hope you don't mind I borrowed your gun. - Works for me. I think she liked me. - It's over. My sister now can rest in peace. - That's true. Not sure if we can though. Get me out of here. What's up? You're not talking. - Oh nothing. - Come on. After all we've been through, you can pretty much tell me anything now. - Nothing that bad. I'm just curious. - What about? - Do you know that day Esmay was killed, you called me. - Oh yeah. Yeah I did. - Well, you said you were going for a job interview. What was it for? - Would you believe me if I told you it was for a job as a butcher? â™« This feeling's sweet â™« It's bittersweet and it's all that I need â™« You keep me safe â™« You keep me safe in a shield of my rage â™« These freezing nights â™« They're turning my soul into ice â™« Without you here â™« No evil shall I fear â™« When dark is closing in â™« And the thunderstorms begin â™« When skies are torn apart â™« Love will reign once again in your heart â™« Revenge is sweet â™« It's oh so sweet â™« And it's all that I need â™« And when you die â™« You've got to die â™« It's an eye for an eye â™« These freezing nights â™« They're turning my soul into ice â™« When dark is closing in â™« And the thunderstorms begin â™« When skies are torn apart â™« Love will reign once again in your heart â™« When dark is closing in â™« And the thunderstorms begin â™« When skies are torn apart â™« Love will reign once again in your heart â™« When skies are torn apart â™« Love will reign once again in your heart
