Why don't you finish it? -Calm down Sadegh You're a respectable man How can I when I've no money? Do your job Why are you asking for the impossible? Why do you try to build a house when you've no money? Don't speak to me like that what are you saying? Please -Leave him alone He's right, every job needs its own tools and materials He's right in what he says You can't renovate a house with empty hands Especially this Cr√©minil castle Too big of a task -What are you saying woman? I've never asked you for money for you to be moaning I've managed it so far I'll take on the rest too Don't give yourself all the credit You can manage the instalments for the rugs, it's 2 weeks past their deadline Have you been to the mosque -Yes I have But it was pointless -Why? How much did you need? They didn't care how much it was they could pay it But I needed another sort of help God help me Don't let me go back empty handed Thanks If you had brought in your paperwork a bit earlier I'd pay you right now Have you brought cheques?

The loan, you asked me to come later I did I didn't say come the next day We've not got enough money now The amount you're asking for means you have to wait Haji you don't understand You don't know me well enough you know my dad You were friends, you used to see each other Yes Your dad is my close friend But we've not got enough money Not here, go over there -Ok sure If that's true, how did you pay him?

Of course I have -Seriously? Interesting! I didn't know Although it was at the start When I was a student Right Yes Memories I'll never forget Don't worry Elaheh it was a dream -It was horrible I had a dream that you were at war And you've been shot by a massive bullet Was I wounded? No you died Sadegh Yes of course, you think about it so you dream it She probably just wants to get rid of me No Mr Meshkini, you're mistaken I know haji Mansouri from the old days he has good intentions You had to be a little less modest and told him you'd served the war -Yes I wouldn't mention such a thing I'm just telling you I don't mention it just anywhere Secondly I need the papers to prove it which I don't have it You could find someone as your witness Yes But unfortunately was asleep Asleep? -I mean I meant myself I was between dream and reality from the shock And there were no real witnesses about Right I'm sure if haji Mansouri knew you're such a good person It'd be a different story -Thanks I'm an ordinary person -I'll never forget the day I met you Yes Me too Here's Mr Meshkini our new colleague We'll be working with him as of today This is Mr Kamali, he's our top videographer He's the best for the war -Mr Backtosh is making a fuss, it's not true Here's evidence, a memoir from war Mr Kamali always keeps it on him Yes I'm sure his leg was wounded during war, right? -Yes That's what war is like You should take care of yourself during this trip To be honest, I never thought you'd be this willing to come to places like this Yes of course Sir Don't send me to the war front or anything like that I can't go They have the programmes You'll be staying with me don't worry Thanks man Also I've another problem you can help solve it What is it? -My house is half done, I've no money to finish it I swear I'm empty-handed otherwise I'd be happy to help I'm not asking you, could you get me a loan? You've not enough experience -I've been working for the TV for 4,5 years now I was a student -Ok You have to wait a little So many were before you I heard the videographers have an account -Yes they do You have to wait for that too Actually Kamali is one of the determining agents -Right His word means a lot They respect him a lot too They'll give it to you if he says -Tell him then I've asked for so many others I can't ask anymore You have to do it yourself It'll take time but it's worth it He's a nice man He'll look out for you if you become friends Try to get close I have to make conversation to get close Mr Kamali Yes I wanted to say I won't forget the day we were supposed to come to the front together To be honest, I never thought I'd ever be this lucky I have dreamt of it before, I wanted to thank you -No problem These sorts of things are out of our hands, he has to want us to be there Yes That's actually one of those memories that'll never be forgotten Hi Mr Kamali -Hi Mr Meshkini, how are you? Thank you, what's going on? Are you leaving? There has been a big mission last night Our brothers are going down south Interesting! Aren't you going with them?

Either with the videographers or room 123 Right in the middle of war, in the war front in Ahvaz Why! -What war front? Ahvaz is safe, people are living in it I don't get you -Thanks Have you forgotten your brother's wedding? -That was the start of war The enemies were close to town Ahvaz was under bullets -That's it, the front line isn't a strange thing Don't make a fuss Sadegh Ahvaz is quiet right now You'll film for 48 hours and come back -Where? War front? Under the bullets? -So he keeps saying Ahvaz is a quiet town There's a long way to the front You'll be back by Wednesday if you leave today I'll know where I stand too I'm either with the Sciend and Industry group or poetry Then we'll work together you'll become th standard videographer of the group There'll be no war there What kind of a friend are you? -Didn't you want a loan?

You can get it once you're back You just have to get close to Kamali on the way He likes you, he's said it to me quite a few times Try to get closer to him Get yourself together, go "You just have to get close to Kamali on the way" When will he get there? -Be patient There's not much left, we'll get there -I can't wait anymore I want to get there as soon as possible You have to control your excitement Dial down the excitement in yourself -I hope I can Get back quicker Have you told the family where you're going? Yeah I told them, they were very nice about it too Also I've written a will too A will for I'm sorry about the dream I had I didn't mean bad It looks like they've set back There's nothing going on here -There was at the start It was unsafe but they pushed the enemy back Right So it's safe here -Yes, thank god So it's not dangerous? -No it's safe We'll be staying here, right? Yes we'll be back tomorrow once we're done here It's a shame -What is? I wanted to stand in front of the enemy and say What do you want from these people? No I can't I can't calm down unless I'm at the front I would love to buy one of the scarves the soldiers have around their neck I like them, it has a good name Yes Chafieh I should remember to get one This is good sir I thought I'd get a memento to say I've been to the front Take some sort of evidence with us I like you a lot I have promised myself to bring you along for the next trip No, looks like he has plans for us God damn you Backtosh -Pardon?

God help me -That's what god has intended There's always a reason It's not right to object Please, let's go back to Tehran Yes, there's no other choice We have to go back But Mr Kamali I... How do we get back? I know it's hard But there's no other choice and we need a pass We can't go anywhere with a pass either -Why not?

How did you get hold of them? See Mr Meshkini you can fly now Yes, really I was about to jump up into the air -Mr Meshkini pray for us Don't forget us when you go to the front Sure, I'll pray Ok sure It's odd Seyyed is never in town he's always out He came around exactly when we needed his help God loves you a lot Now you can go Wait here, I need to ask for the address to the camp Please, let me go this once I said no -This one time Please let me go this once haji I'll have you arrested if you keep insisting Please I get you What is it sir?

Our lives are valuable Please, please try to understand him What are you like? Why do you try to get me into trouble brother? Get down, come on Why did you just get in? Get into a different car I'm tired I know But we were to go and come back together I'm going the same way You want to come with me? -That's what I've wanted all along Why didn't you say before? -Get in Get in, you were impatient I've never seen anyone so impatient in my life Tell me how could you leave me behind and go? I thought you'd mock me if I'd explain Why would I? It's a natural feeling, I was the same But you're a little different you go too far I'm sorry to have caused you any inconvenience Damn this life Bravery is very good But everything has a limit You have to keep it under control! -My point entirely Mr Kamali I say wife and kids have their own place War and the front has its own value too Sometimes you have to face the enemy What's the problem in that? We'll do it too -When it's time, yes Good, well done -Am I right? Yes you are Really? Do you agree? Of course I am -Really? I'm serious, believe me -Oh good Love you -We need someone like you on our team Don't say that I really think you What was that? -What? The tanks, one more there -They belong to the enemy The enemy had moved closer but we took our land back Look how far they came It's annoying, it makes me want to Pull over further ahead He's a man too, he gets it He's not a robot Why are you smearing mud on there? -We use it as disguise For the enemy? Where is it? What was that? -Don't be afraid, it was from our side So it can shoot from this distance? This is nothing, it can be used from 4 or 5 kilometres away We're only 2 kilometres away from the front 2 kilometres? But It's a little unbelievable It is see? You didn't have to get inside the ambulance Don't stand there Get in This is the end, the front line You're being impatient again, no it's not get out It's the last time I'm bringing him with me, I was wrong Why did you stay? I sent you away why did you come back? You have to be home, go -Please haji, let me stay There's no car to take me back -I don't want you here, brother Why don't you get it? -I beg you Don't beg me go Go to Ahvaz, or Tehran I'll arrange the transport myself Please -Mr Kamali the chief is so cool I really like him can we video him?

I'm here for my duty You're so modest You didn't want to say you were serving the war It was not for me to mention haji God bless you I'm so sorry Have you been here before? Yes, I mean almost That's odd, how come I've never seen you before? Where did you used to be? I used to explode tanks What? -Tanks Tanks? -Yes I don't understand, what did you do? What was it called? Not Jeep I handled PRGs Do you mean RPG? -Yes that's it, RPG I've used it so much, I've forgotten the name -Very good God bless you, I'm so sorry to have treated you that way It's ok haji, it happens What's this?

Welcome -I don't want this We're not doing anything, it's for soldiers -Don't say that Mr Meshkini Everyone should have one it doesn't make a difference You need it more than anyone else No they'll run out If not all of them get it We don't need one, I mean We Aren't worthy -Take it, don't say that Take it son, it's so that they can identify you I feel better, everyone will know you now Ok Thanks Mr Kamali, how's your leg doing?

I don't want my colleagues to know about my past Ok fine What have you done for it? I've forgotten about it doctors say it's genetic It might get better with physical exercise Your colleague is a very modest man Yes, he's annoyed us too I've never seen anyone so brave and passionate in my life You know me, he has left me behind so many times To get to the front line Yes I've controlled him Otherwise he'd be right at the front I've given up I can't stop him These plaques are essential for people like him You and I are careful These young men are too passionate God it's so surprising this way I'm not prepared at all My wife, kid, dad Damn your dreams Oh god, they're coming They probably have a new plan God Where did you find the other guy from? Bad timing Mr Meshkini Your request for the loan is approved Really haji? -Yes You can come to the office in mosque once you get back to take the loan Thank you so much When will you get back? -In a day or two Come see me -Sure Sure -Good luck Bye I definitely have to get back It's pointless for me to stay here Excuse me!
