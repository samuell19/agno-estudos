Trump! I was telling some of the folks backstage I never ever thought we would do this well this fast, this has been so incredible, what's happened all over, but what's happened in Iowa, has been... Oh my god. Well, I'm taking the car! I feel disgusting just being there. Still pissed I lost my favorite boxers. You realize we're gonna have to tell our wives about this someday? This is how our grade'll be remembered. Shit, man. I don't remember any of it. Bullshit. Other people saw, dude. Everybody blacked out. I high-fived you. You mean during?

Lucky us. Usually when guys chat me up, the first thing they ask is if I'm generous. Are you generous? Are you? Aren't you cold? I live around the corner. Make yourself comfortable. Do you have anything to eat? Yeah, well, you're just wasting away, aren't you. Just a small-town, corn-fed gay boy, moved to New York City to follow his dreams. Do you like my bed? It's a bit short. It came wrapped up like a cylinder. Is this whole townhouse yours? Yeah. Make yourself comfortable.

He's not gonna miss these? These pants? Does he have any underwear? Maybe some underwear. I don't know how to use this fuckin' thing. Well that looks like you. Feels like me. You like purple? Not particularly. Yeah it's terrible, take it off. How 'bout... this. Here you go. Yeah. Well if you want something a little nicer... ...try that. He has so many B.O. stains on his shirts. It fits. Do you think he'll know I'm homeless? Let's go with your eyes. What do you do? I'm a lawyer. But that's just what I do for a living, Most of my friends are artists and performers. 'cuz everybody does. 'Cuz everybody does. 'cuz everybody does. I'm just old. You're much more handsome than in your photo. You're more cute in your photo. I'm not cute. I have seven brothers and sisters. We're not a typical family, we all like each other. We get along really well. I was raised Irish Catholic. I must not've been a very cute kid, 'cuz the priests never so much as glanced at me. My dad was an amazing man. He sang in the church choir, 'cuz he loved to sing and stuff. Yeah, he was my best friend. Do you see him much? My parents both passed a while ago. Would you like another? I wandered lonely as a cloud That floats on high, o'er veils and hills When, all at once I saw a crowd A host of golden daffodils Beside the lake, beneath the trees Fluttering and dancing in the breeze Continuous as the stars that shine and twinkle on the milky way They stretched in never-ending line Along the margin of a bay Ten-thousand, I saw at a glance Tossing their heads in spritely dance The waves... I get nervous. Is he a sugar daddy? So, um, you sent me a lot of messages. Did I? Well, we're here now. You have small ears. I do? Well, compared to the rest of you. You okay? USA! USA! USA! What's happening? You can stay at the apartment if you'd like. Yeah, thanks. You don't say much. I'm quiet. Are you always this quiet? I'm a good listener. So, what do you wanna do for dinner? I could really go for some meatballs. Maybe some dessert? Do you want anything? I want you. I have three kids, by two ex-wives. I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner, but you didn't ask, so I didn't have to lie to you. I hope we can still be friends. Cheers. It's okay. So this guy told me he was in a relationship, but lookin' for a dad And I had to ask him about that, because for me, Dad implies supporting him, and accepting him. Hey, let's get comfortable, do you mind if I do this? Come on, do what I'm doin'. Isn't that nice? My ex-wife was a first-rate lying bitch. And my ex-boyfriend wasn't much better. But he did give better head. Come here. Come sit here. I'm fuckin' my boy. I'm fuckin' my boy. It's hard to find good people. So, uh, I don't want to offend you, but, uh, I can't really hang out anymore this afternoon. Every Sunday I get so anxious about having to go back to work the next morning that I can't think about anything else. I wouldn't be very good company. I should probably see a psychiatrist. It's okay. I'll see you soon. Yeah, yeah, definitely, we'll see what's happening, huh? Should we split this? I'm really sorry, I don't have any cash on me. That's okay. - I-I got it. - Thanks. Good luck with work tomorrow. Oh, yeah, thank you. I'll probably want to shoot myself in the head a couple times when I get up, but, uh, once I get there, it'll be okay. Hello? Hello, my name is Joseph, what's yours? Joseph. What? Aw, no way. Funny coincidence. I'm looking for someone to spend time with, and yes, I can pay. What are you looking to do? Just have some safe fun. I live upstate in Tuckahoe, but I can travel. What do you do? I work in a restaurant. I'm a chef. What else do you like to do? I like movies. I'm sure you like movies, who doesn't, huh? Wanna see a movie this weekend? I'd love that. I'd love to make more than 500. Maybe you can give me money for the tickets? I will have more than 500 in my wallet. I'll get the tickets. I got it. Daddy. What am I gonna do about you? Which one is your good eye? I'm a cyclops. I love you. Okay, here's one you can help me with. "Cease, exclamation point, at sea." I got nothin'. "Avast." You find your socks? Mhm. You need to get used to me not being a part of your life. Have you ever been arrested? Well, I threw an ash tray at the mother of my son... ...but I managed to avoid jail time. I'm gonna smack you back to the cornfields of Iowa. You got back in touch with me. Why? I don't know. Hey. Let's go to Atlantic City. Come on, we'll play some games, go to a show, go to the spa, we'll get a couple nice meals, we'll get a room, what do you think? What'd I do to deserve that? Because you're so nice. My twin brother molested one of my daughters. She was thirteen. So do I have a reason to beat the living fuck out of him? I made peace with the fact that he did it, but it wasn't easy. Want me to show him where my mother lives? Oh yeah. Here, gamble with this. Can I turn the light on? Come here. How hard is that? You have to understand. It was a different time. So, what's the plan, man? Oh, it's complicated. I have to work in the morning, and you know how I am about my work, and if you stay here, you're not going to let me sleep. Yes I will. No you won't. Jesus Christ. We used to walk down the block, and if we heard music, we would just go in. If there was a party, we automatically knew people. Do you know I have lived in this same apartment, the whole time? Wow. Mhm. Crazy. All right. All right. We'll get together soon. Okay. Have fun. And be a good boy. I miss you. I don't want to be missed. Everybody wants to be missed. Maybe. Are you an actor? I'm a lawyer. Oh yeah. Boy. Um, they have rolls and stuff. It's pretty good. Anyway have a good day. Can I borrow some money? I'd be a terrible fucking mom. I love you. I love you too. I love you too. Listen, um, I'm really glad you texted me tonight. Though I don't usually go for guys with smooth chests. I don't usually go for felons. Do you think I could crash with you tonight? No. No no. Look, we can't have everything, uh... I'm not who you think I am. What? What, you're going to force yourself on m... Be careful, please. I love your skin. I hate my skin. Mm, I love your name. Well, find somebody else's name to love. I think you should leave. That's not a bad way of saying goodbye. Pump. Pump. Pump. Couple more. You're going to feel a little pinch. Little pinch. We had a house together. He stayed, and I had to leave. For the first time in my life, I'm bitter. Promise me you'll fuck me again. I don't need money. Okay. I'm gonna turn you a little bit this way to give you a more flat light. No, that way. That's much... yeah, that's even kinder. I ain't kiddin' you. Good. Your being ill, you know, I think of your mother, also. Yeah. And, uh... You would've loved my mother. I mean this is very good, thank you very much, it was more than that, it was just... I wouldn't think of having my picture taken. So, but you're taking good care of yourself, right? Well I imagine they won't let you, uh, you know... They don't let me do anything. Right. What's this... they don't let you do anything? Not much. Stay where you are, Helen, that's very nice. I really like this. Oh my god, this is amazing. You're amazing Helen! Can you spare five minutes at this late hour? No no no, I'm not gonna do it. I just wanted to... because... You know what? It's out of my hands, it's... Basically, I can't... I'm at wit's end. I'm at wit's end. It's out of my hands, it's... Hello? Seven. Eight. Nine. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten. This and this and this I'm gonna put in here. What is this? So I have to open this, right? Download it. Oh god, no. Did I ever write down... Did I ever write down what my... I don't know what my number is. I do not know what my number is. I forgot my password. If I stand up, and I'm just going to hold on here, and she gave me this exercise... You can see I can barely raise it. Mhm. And... what else did she do? She had one other thing, where I put a, uh, band on here, and it gets resistance. Sure. And I have no idea what happened, but the change, last Saturday and since has been quite striking to me. Okay. You know, the joke always is, you throw away your cane, and, you know... All right. Do you find yourself tripping at all, or anything like that? No. Does that foot catch on you? No. And, I, what else is there to tell you... nothing. I have no pain, and when I did walking on Saturday and Sunday, I didn't have any pain when I came home, the next day. Well, I know what the weakness is from. Right. You have a slippage on two levels, at L5 and L5S, where the bones are shifting a bit out of position. Right. And that happens to some people, as their discs wear out. The spine becomes a little bit unstable. It's not like it's wobbling all over the place, but they shift just slightly out of position. Right. And that can trap the nerve, and certainly the left-sided nerve, your L5 nerve, your number 5 nerve, which controls the power of your hip, goes down to the foot, controls the power of your foot there, that looks like it is pinched. Yeah. Now, when you have weakness, if it's weakness that is really limiting you, meaning you're tripping over your foot all the time, your hip is weak, you can't walk without a cane, those kinds of things, oftentimes we are recommending to fix that, because if you wait too long, and then you do it, sometimes you can't get the return of that function. If you have pain, most people who have significant pain don't tolerate that for too long. That argument was just, out in outer space. Whatever the money involved is fine, but send the check, and, I don't think it's that kind of question, I don't know why, all right? I'm doing it. There may have been complications, but it's not my problem this week. So, that's what I wanted to say: I've done what I can today. All right? That's all for now, okay? I lost it. I don't know what needs to be done. And I'm scared. And I tried to change, and I did change. But I didn't... I didn't do anything, that would make a difference.
