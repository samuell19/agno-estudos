(ominous music) (clanking) (croaking) (grunting) - Thanks for the ride. - You're welcome. - I know. (grunting) (foreboding music) (sniffs) (sighs) Reporting, my lord. - What is the status of the takeover of the Shaolin Temple? - We've penetrated the final barrier. We expect total takeover within two days. We have suffered great casualties, but they are expendable. - Very good. Keep me informed on further developments. - Sire? There is one more thing. - Speak. - (sighs) Oh boy. There is a thief who we've already identified who penetrated our chamber hall last night. Surprisingly, he only departed with a mere plaque of stone. - What? Say what? You let him escape with the sun stone map of Kaloon! - But sire, it was just a mere plaque of stone! What value could it possibly have? - Silence! (squeals) That piece of stone is essential in my plans for conquest. - Say what? (burps) - I want him alive! For this thief now has in his grubby little hands the key. The key to a force, to a power most big. - Hmm. - [Raspmutant] Don't worry, my lord, he'll never make it past the Valley of the Yoko Onis. (sinister laughter) (tense music) (gasps) (screeching) (growls) (grunting) (roaring) (yelps) (grunting) (growling) (grunting) (screams) (grunting) (shouting) (howling) (humming) - Hmm. (laughs) Perfect. - Ha! What was that, an exhibition? (cackling) - Huh? - Huh? - I see a finger pointing a way towards the moon. - Huh? - Oh! (groaning) - Concentrate on the finger and you will miss all the heavenly glory. Huh? (crunching) (shouting in pain) (shushes) Ninjas. Come on. Come on. I don't see them. I think we lost them. Ow! (grunting) - Ha, fooling around again! You're really lucky I wasn't an imperial ninja, or else I would have... (whimsical music) Who are you? - It's me, Lao Ze! (laughs) - And what's with the wig? - It's an exhibition! (cackles) - Listen up. I don't want anymore fooling around. I got a funny feeling we're gonna be very popular from now on. So you guys pay attention at all times, you understand? (chuckles) - Thanks for the warning. - [Reepo] Yeah. - So did you get the map? - They don't call me master thief for nothing. - Oh. That's it? - That's it. - Looks like a gingerbread man. - A gingerbread man? - I'm hungry. - You're always hungry. - I'm hungry! - This gingerbread man, as you call it, is a map that'll lead us to a power so big that we'll be able to save our once glorious village from the evil clutches of the Bamboo Man from Kapow. (crunching) - Hmm? - So does it taste as good as it looks? (chuckles) - No, and now I'm really hungry! - Oh. Well then, perhaps we should go and have some tea. - Right, I know a great restaurant in town. - I bet you do. - What are we waiting for? Let's go. - [Lao] I can't believe you just spit on my new kung fu shoes. (croaking) (foreboding music) (croaking) (chatting) - So the sun stone thief's on his way here. You tell Raspmutant the sheriff will take care of this matter personally. (bell chiming) (speaking foreign language) - (gasps) Ooh, someone's gonna get it. (chuckles) Ooh, look, boss, it's that dumb guy we're after. He's fallen into our evil clutches. (giggles) ♪ La, la, la, la, la, la, la ♪ ♪ Time to wreck the restaurant again ♪ - Huh, not again! Why do you always have to fight in my restaurant? ♪ Gonna teach the kung fu etiquette ♪ ♪ Cause that's what a master does ♪ (giggling) (tense music) - [Man] Come on, let's get out of here, come on! - Hey! (clamoring) (bell ringing) (croaking) - [Owner] Fighting again. - I smell trouble. - Nothing we can't handle. - Well, what special occasion is this, that I have the honor of being graced by a high presence such as yourself, hm? - Hey, don't be so formal. I'm Chen Chow Mein, master thief and all-around great guy. - Do you know who I am? - Don't you? (chuckles) (bullet ricocheting) - Ooh! - [Ba Foon] Big trouble. - I'm the Sheriff of Ching Wa County. - Yeah, but who are you? And where's your badge? - Ooh, what ripply muscles. (chuckling) - Hey. (chuckling) (moaning) (tense drum music) - These are my students, all disciples of the Shaolin Eagle Drunken Snake Fist of the Mystic Schoolboy Clan. (moaning) Well, well, well, it looks you three fools better know kung fu. Cause we're gonna teach you a lesson in kung fu etiquette then. (laughing) - Just you three lousy guys? And I'm not impressed. - Well, perhaps you'll be impressed by this. (shouting) (tense music) - Better to stand. - And divide it? - We're outnumbered? - Go get them, boss! - Oh yes! (shouting) - Your move, sucker. - So much for lunch. - Ooh, you're gonna get it now! (giggling) Woo! - So what's it gonna be, punk? (screaming) (thudding) (ominous music) - What's taking him so long? (groaning) You again. Huh? (croaking) Oh, right. (clanking) (door creaking) (croaking) (groans) Filthy scum. (chanting in foreign language) Sire? - [Bamboo Man] Oh, my powers! (shouts) (growling) (choking) - I have good news, Sire. - This better be good. (coughing) - The sheriff of Ching Wa County has the thief and his accomplices in his clutches. We expect to bring the scums here for interrogation. - Silence! I'll decide the fate of those who stole my sun stone! - Yeah, yeah. - Now let me think. Ah. Bring the fools here for interrogation| (hissing) I want the stones now. - Yes, my lord. I shall bring the stones here for interrogation. I guarantee it, ah. (growls) (thudding) (squealing) (moaning) - [Dar Ling] Oh, my head. Who turned out the lights? - [Ba Foon] Oh, I don't feel good. Oh, Dar Ling. (chuckling) - It's just another day of kung fu fighting. (laughing) So where are we going? - To see the old wise man about this map. - Wait a minute, you don't mean that old drunk that claims he knows all for a price that's small? - That's the one. - I don't like him. - And I don't trust him. - Well I don't either. (uplifting music) - Say, you got any money? - No. But Reepo does! - Hey! - Come here. (laughing) (bell chiming) (mystical music) - Wow, will you look at this place? - Oh. Why couldn't we just meet him at the old tavern? Like last time? - Well I don't like it. It's creepy. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no, wait, wait! - Meow, meow! Meow, meow! - Hello? Is anybody here? - This place is as creepy as the old fool. - I like it. (scraping) (gong sounds) - Ow! (suspenseful music) What's happening? (shouting) What did I do? (whimsical music) (chuckles) Huh? (suspenseful music) (moaning) - What? What? - Behind you. - What is it? - Look, look! (shouts in fear) (growling) (snake screeching) (grunting) - (growls) Next time try using the doorbell, you idiot! (yelps) (growls) (sighs) - Greetings, oh wise man. - What is it this time? A magic lantern, or a treasure map, perhaps? - Yeah, well how did you-- (growls) - Now, first, perhaps a little something to warm the belly. (laughs) (snaps) - Hm? (giggling) - Not this time, you old fart. (grunting) (chimes jingling) - So tell me a little something about this map. It's the sun stone map of Kaloon. It has an ancient form of hieroglyphics that I need deciphered. - The sun stone map? It was rumored to be lost for over a century. How'd you fools acquire it? - Huh, hey, that's none of your business! We pay you, and you tell us what we wanna know. (tense music) - Don't touch that! - Huh? - Sit down. (coughing) - I see business is booming. (snake chirping) (chuckling) - Now let me see this map. (insect buzzing) Looks like a gingerbread man. (whimsical music) Aha! According to these hieroglyphics, follow the map to the spot marked X and you will come upon a power most big. - Well that much we know. - Tell us more. (sighs) - The start point of this map is located in the ancient town of Tupid, which is, which is... If you head north, it's two stones' throw, one pebble, and a hip hop away. (growling) (chuckles) (hissing) - [Chen] And don't touch anything. - Now let me get this straight. This town is two stones' throw, one pebble, and a hip hop away? - That is correct. - Oh, hm. What the hell's a hip hop? - Hey, lighten up. - Well he's making this really hard on us, Chen. - Exactly how far is a hip hop? - It's two days downhill, three days up. - Huh, not bad. Pretty smart for a dumb little stupid. - Dumb luck, I guess, hm? - I thought so. But still, according to these inscriptions, danger will befall he who holds this map. (yelps) - Well that much we know. Can you tell us our fortunes? - Yeah, what are our chances? - Well, let me see. Hm, hm, hm. Oh, most depressing. I see. - Tell us, what do you see? - I see! (tense music) - Uh-huh? - I see that it is empty. (chuckling) - Huh? (chuckling) - Let me see your right hand. (gasps) Your other right! In your search for the power most big, you will be captured and strung up like a pig. (yelps) (laughs) Aha, but lucky for you, when misfortune has doomed a friend to his fate, your climb to the top will mean his escape. Yeah, hey, don't touch that! (crashing) (tense music) - Yeah, but I, I... - What's his fortune? (moans) - With all the strength that comes from your heart, your mind is empty and useless like a fart. (laughing) Now sit down and pay attention! Listen to what I have to tell you, for it could mean life or death. When all of the hardship have befallen the three, three join together to unlock the key. For no chain is stronger than the chain's weakest link. Three join together, the key is closer than you think. (foreboding music) - What's this key you speak of? - Nevermind. Just remember this. The key is the puzzle, you got that? - [Lao] Don't look at me. - Yeah, I got it. - Now get out of here. You've wasted enough of my valuable drinking time. - [Lao] Every time we come here, he gives us a drunken riddle, I'm sick of it! - Why are you looking at me? (shouts) (farts) (upbeat music) - [Chen] Remember, to master the art of kung fu, you must first perfect the three key elements of speed, balance, and precision. The success of our quest heavily depends on our superior kung fu skills. Hm. Maybe this mission wasn't such a good idea. (serene music) - What is zen? Zen is what it is. Chen? I'm quite disturbed. - What's on your mind? - Well, in all these years I've known you, you always seem so calm in times of danger. When your life is being threatened, what are you thinking of? - I think of that which is beyond thinking. - Oh, please enlighten me. How do you do that? - By not thinking. - Ah! - Where is Reepo? ♪ We're three fools from the orient ♪ ♪ And we're back in trouble, a predicament ♪ ♪ The bad guys need a lesson in kung fu etiquette. ♪ (whistling) ♪ Reepo, Chen Chow Mein, Lao Ze ♪ ♪ Kung fu rascals three ♪ (whistling) (ominous music) - Call for Reepo, we're running late. (whistling) - Hey, jungle boy! (grunting) - Huh? Ninja! - Huh? (shouting) (suspenseful music) (yelping) (grunting) (wailing) - Speed! (moaning) - Catch! - Got it! (shouting) Balance! (grunting) - Precision. (giggling) - [Lao] Come on, come on! (yelps) (grunting) (shouting) (yelping) (grunting) - Where? Huh? (humming) (growling) (giggling) (grunting) (yelping) - [Ninja] You've yet to master the three elements. (yowling) - [Lao] One element's all I need. - [Ninja] Yeah! You can't escape us this time. - Ha, just you three lousy guys, hm? - [Ninja] Learn to count, you imbecile. But first, prepare to die. (grunting) (energetic music) - I got a bone to pick with you guys. - It's your bones-- - The vultures will-- - Be picking up-- - Then! Right! (shouting) (suspenseful music) (grunting) (shouts) (humming) You won't be so lucky next time. - Hey you! (croaking) (moaning) - [Broadsword Ninja] He's mine. (grunting) He's tough! (yowling) - [Ninja Monk] Try me! He's super tough. - [Sword Ninja] He doesn't scare me. I've seen him fight. Here, hold this. - Now that I'm warmed up, which one of you wanna die first? - Get him. - Get him? - [Sword Ninja] Get him. - [All] Get him! (yelping) (croaking) - Huh, hey. Hey you, come back here! Huh? I'm gonna get you! (shouts) (grunting) (croaking) (shouts) - Nevermind. Where's Lao? (muffled shouting) (chanting) - [Lao] Let me go! Let me go! Don't you know who I am? Let me go! - Shut up! ♪ One less fool from the army ♪ ♪ And he got himself in a predicament ♪ ♪ We taught this rascal a lesson ♪ ♪ In kung fu etiquette ♪ (laughing) (suspenseful music) - Lao. - Lao. - Okay, everybody, remember, next turn I get to deal. What strong cards. (chuckling) Hurry, come on, hurry up. (grunting) Oh, look. (giggling) (moaning) I'll match your five and raise you another five. I'm gonna win. - Hey! Ninja skulls, get me out of this! (grunting) Do you hear me? I said untie me. - He's annoying. - Get me out of here! - [Ninja] Shut him up. (moaning) - Hey! Help me! The bugs are crawling on me! - [Ninja] (growls) Hey, do you mind? I'm trying to concentrate on the game, so shut up! (grunts) Can you believe this guy? Hey! Cheating on me again. Every time I turn my back, you're cheating on me. Why you miserable... (giggling) - Read them and weep. I win. Pay up. - [Ninja] You're a strange fella. (chuckling) (shouting) - Oh, he's so noisy. - [Lao] You hear me? Enough's enough! Stop joking around! - Noisy. - You offended my family, and you offended the Shaolin-- - Shut up. You can talk all you want when the boss gets here. (giggling) (whooshing) (suspenseful music) (sniffs) Hey, you guys, the boss is coming, the boss is coming! Hurry, hurry, come on! - Come on, the boss, come on. (moaning) - Oh come on, hurry. Ba Foon, give up the cards, come on, hurry. Over here. Clean up. (tense music) Ooh. Oh. (moaning) - [Ninja] Oh, ominous. - Oh. (giggling) - You won't get away with this. When my friends show up-- - When! (gasps) Your foolish friends show up, we'll be waiting. In the meantime, why don't you tell us where the map is? (chuckles) - Search me. - Hm. That's a very good idea. - Ooh, it'll be my pleasure, woo! - Get away from me, you, you, whatever you are! - Ooh. (chuckles) (laughing) (whimsical music) Ooh. (giggles) - Oh look, oh look. - Very clever. I would guess that each of you have a piece. Suppose you tell me where your friends are. If you tell me, I might even let you go. - Never. (chuckles) - Then I shall have to do it my way! (grunting) (gong sounds) (moaning) (suspenseful music) (yelping) (gasping) (brakes screeching) - Oh, mm-hm, okay. (gasping) (tense music) - But he scares me! (chuckling) (shouts) - Get me my golden box. (yelps) (glass breaking) (gasping) (ominous music) (gasping) (groaning) (chuckling) - Ooh. - Oh, that's nice. Let's see what goodies we have here. (gasping) No. Oh. Oh yes, get you some. (giggling) No. This a very popular one, especially when you twist. (laughing) No, I've got better. Oh, so be it, this should do the trick. (ominous music) - Ooh. (chuckles) - What are you gonna do with those? - Shut up, you freak! (laughing) (suspenseful music) - No! Not the hair! No! No! (crying) No! (laughing) Stop, oh, stop! No! (cackling) Stop. I can't take any more of this. Please, just kill me now. - Then talk, or it gets worse! - No. (laughing) It can't get any worse than it is now. - Oh, but it can. - No! (cackling) No! - [Ninja] Oh? - Huh? (sighs) (shushes) - He's up on top, tied to the tree. You sneak around the back and I'll distract them from the front. Uh-huh. - Mm-hm. - Oh, and keep it quiet. - Right. (shushes) - Did you hear that? - What was that? (whimsical music) (shushes) (tense music) (grunting) (insect buzzing) (whimsical music) (bird screeches) - [Ninja] Huh? Intruder! - Hi. - After him! After him, come on! (tense music) (shouts) Sticky fly paper technique. - [Gruff Ninja] Snap out of it! He's getting away! - Right! - Hey, come on! (groaning) - [Ninja] I thought that technique was obsolete for centuries. (groaning) Hey, use the stairs! - [Gruff Ninja] Right. - [Ninja] Going somewhere? (grunting) (shouting) (whimsical music) (groans) - Most impressive falling skill. - Huh? - Huh? Hey look, it's Achoo. (chuckles) - Hi. - We want a word with you. - [Ninja] Yeah. (moaning) (ominous music) - A most impressive entry. I see you've used the sticky fly paper technique. Proven to be obsolete for centuries. - Oh. (chuckles) - It works fine for me. - But still, you're all alone, and you're surrounded. (shouting) And you will not get away this time. (laughing) (tense music) You know, for a master thief, you're incredibly dumb, as well as stupid, for using the front door a second time. - Uh-huh. - Mm-hm. - Ooh. (chuckles) Well, tough guy, the tables have turned this time. - Eh? (moans) (thudding) - Uh oh. - Not quite. You wasted all your energy guarding the front door. But who's guarding your back door? (ominous music) - The back door? - [Ba Foon] Back door, uh-oh. - The back door? Get him! (shouting) - Another day of kung fu fighting. (shouts) (grunting) - Oh, they're at it again! (sniffs) - Lao. (foreboding music) Huh? (screams) Lao! (yelps) (moaning) Lao, Lao. - Oh. (laughs) Don't laugh! It was terrible, terrible! Huh? (shouting) (suspenseful music) I've got an old score to settle. - Right, go. Hey, hey! Hey! Yeah, over here, yeah, come and get me! (laughing) (shouting) (yowling) (groovy music) (yelping) (thudding) - It's Lao's time. (grunting) (suspenseful music) (shouting) (growling) (shouts) - You will not win a second time. (shouts) (laughs) (grunting) - [Ninja] There he is, go! (screams) (grunting) (screams) My sword! (grunting) Not me, him! (shouting) (grunting) (laughs) - It looks like three fools are tougher than one! (growling) (shouts) (grunting) (shouts) - Hurry, hurry! We gotta find a place to hide! (moaning) Right. (yowling) (clucking) Hey. (yelping) Hey, watch the nose, you! (clucking) Oh, I said watch the nose, you. (clucking) Get him, use your chicken style kung fu. - Chen never told me about chicken style. - What, uh-oh. (yowls) (birds twittering) (moans) - Oh, my poor nose. (yowling) (giggles) (grunting) (shouts) (shouting) (grunting) (growling) - I assure you, there won't be a third time. (growls) (grunting) (chuckling) (yelps) (shouts) (gasps) (growls) (grunting) (triumphant music) (shouts) Ooh. (uplifting music) - Hey, Chen, Chen! (laughing) - Ouch. - Hey! (laughing) You did it. Yeah! - Yeah! - Here, you can keep this. (groaning) And I'll take this. (chuckles) Luckily I always carry a spare. (yowling) - We better go before more men arrive. - Very good. Let's go, then. (ominous music) (clanking) (croaking) - [Raspmutant] Reporting, my lord. (hissing) - I assume the fools are on their way here for interrogation? - Eh, no. But I-- - You fail me, and dare return empty-handed? - No, no. I didn't fail you. It was the stupid sheriff of Ching Wa. (growling) I mean it was really a small setback due to the incompetence of my men. I should never have relied on them. (growls) - Then what are you going to do about this small setback? - I'm gonna retrieve the map and bring the fools to you. Personally. (laughing) - You! - Yes. - By what tactical methods will you employ to capture these fools? - Well, I... I... - I think perhaps we will employ the use of my plan. - Speak. I mean, what's on your mind, Sire? - Summon Nio Titan. (croaking) - No, not the Nio Titan. - Yes, the Nio Titan! - But Sire, he is uncontrollable. How will I ever keep him-- - With this. (whizzing) (zapping) Behold the moon stone. With this, he'll obey your every command. But I warn you! Do not fail me this time. (chuckling) - Oh. Thank you, my lord. This time, I will crush them. (laughing) - [Bamboo Man] Now go and bring back what's rightfully mine! (laughing maniacally) - [Chen] When I was but a child, my grandfather told me stories. Fables, really, of how a guardian of the earth protected this castle and its people from evildoers. There was law and order throughout the province until the uprising of the Bamboo Man from Kapow. With his black magic, he overpowered the guardian and destroyed this castle. He ruled the land with an iron fist, and the people eventually fled, never to return. - [Lao] And whatever happened to this guardian of the earth? - [Chen] According to my grandfather, when the guardian was defeated in battle, the Bamboo Man transformed him into a guardian of evil. With it now on his side, the Bamboo Man's reign of terror grew out of control. - [Reepo] Well where is this guardian now? - [Chen] I don't really know, I just know his name. They called him the Nio Titan. - Oh god of stone, hear evil's call. I summon your power from the mountain wall. Awaken from this place of rest. Oh god of death, hear my request. Oh god of death, please, hear my request. (rumbling) (squealing) (ominous music) (laughing) Now go and crush the enemies! (laughing) (humming peacefully) - Missed a spot. (sighs) - All my life I have been searching for the secret of life, but to of no avail! - I learned the secret of life years ago. - You know the secret of life? - [Chen] Mm-hm. - Well tell me, what is it? (shushes) - Come here. It's a secret. - Huh? - According to this map, we are now at the outskirts of the town of Tupid. - Well that means we can go on our quest for the power most big! - Then from now on, everything should be smooth sailing. (chuckling) (rumbling footsteps) - Hm? What is that? - What is that? - I got a bad feeling about this. - Well it's headed this way. Quick, behind the rocks. (suspenseful music) Put the fire out. No, there's no time for that. (shushes) (ominous music) (shouts) - What? - What? - What? - What do you see? (ominous music) (shouting) (shushes) - Keep still, maybe it'll go away. - Maybe he's friendly. - Well that's the meanest smile I've ever seen! (shushes) - Stay here. - Okay. (roaring) (shouting) - Quick, run for it! (wailing) - Oh, run for it, right. (tense music) (roaring) (wailing in fear) (screaming) (gasps) - Come on, come on! Hurry! Come on! (yelling) (roaring) - [Reepo] Hey, wait for me! - Quick, find a way out of here! (screams) (roaring) - [Lao] Oh no! - Look, an opening! - Go, go. - Come on, come on! (yelling in fear) (cackling) - Crush them. (yelps) (roaring) - Yeah, you can do it! Yeah, you can do it! - [Chen] So can you. - You guys save yourselves, don't worry about me. - We can't leave you, we're a team! Just like the old man said. A chain's only as strong as a chain's weakest link. - And the rest link together like a puzzle. - And to solve the puzzle, we need the key. - And the key is the puzzle. - Yeah, but what is the key? - It's a gingerbread man. - [Chen] Think quick. The old man said... - It's a gingerbread man. - Three things join together, the key is closer than you think. Three things gotta join together to form the key. But what is the key? - It's a gingerbread man! He's coming! (roaring) - The gingerbread man! - The gingerbread man! (whooshing) - Huh? (ominous music) Crush them, destroy them! (wailing) (laughs) I have you this time! (roaring) (rumbling) What's this? Huh? Oh no. No. Why does this always happen to me? (screams) (shushing) - Come on. (grinding) (laughing) - (growls) What are you waiting for? Attack! Go, go, go! In the name of the Empire of Kapow, I order you to destroy him! (laughing) Crush, kill, destroy! (suspenseful music) - Good thing he's on our side, huh? - (laughing) Now that's a friendly smile. (tense music) - Crush, crush! (laughs) - Huh? - I have a plan. All right, this is what we do. (groaning) (laughing) - Huh? (moans) (laughing) - Right. - You guys know what to do. In the mean time, I got some pork chopping to do. - We gotta hurry. - Right. (roaring) (laughing) - Try your power against that of the moon stone! (laughing) (chanting in foreign language) (tense music) (laughing) (creaking) Soon the Bamboo Man will obey my every command! (laughing) Evil, evil! You'll never win against the power of my moon stone! I am the power! (laughing) I am indestructible! (squealing) (groaning) My powers! (shouting) (tense music) No, no! (suspenseful music) (gasps) - Come on, hurry it up! - I am hurrying. - Ready? - I think that barnacle guy's doing fine all on his own. - Chen says in order to fight evil, we must have courage. - Here, wrap this around his ankles. (screaming) (grunting) (laughs) Yeah! (yelps) (grunting) (whimpering) - You tell the Bamboo Man with this power most big, we're coming back to kick his ass. Now get out of here. (whimsical music) (suspenseful music) - Come on, hurry. Let's finish this up already. Yeah, that should do it. Right. - Right. (growls) (shouts) (moaning) - Yeah! Yeah! (whimpering) (ominous music) Get out of there, get away from him! Reepo, Lao, get out of there! He's gonna collapse! (screams) (creaking) - No! Reepo! Hang in there, pal! I'll dig you out! - It's no use. He's gone. - No! He's alive! He can't be dead! He can't die on us! He can't! Hang in there, buddy! - He's gone! He's gone. (somber music) (creaking) - He was very brave. - He was always there when we need him. - He saved my life. - He was always very willing to sacrifice himself for the good of others. - [Lao] He was a good friend. - [Chen] Yeah, a very good friend. - [Lao] Hey. Remember when we first met Reepo? - [Chen] Wasn't he running away from a wild boar that he was hunting? - [Lao] It was more like the boar was hunting him. - [Chen] From the way he was screaming, you wouldn't expect the boar to be so small. - [Lao] And after all that, he fell into his own booby trap. - [Chen] Yeah, and we had to rescue him from his own dinner. (sighs) That's our Reepo. - [Lao] I'm really gonna miss him. - [Chen] Yeah, me too. - You know, I really didn't mind him making fun of my hair. - Wow, must have been a great guy. - Yeah. - Yeah. Reepo! - You're alive! (laughing) (uplifting music) - Hey. - But how did you? - Hey, your kung fu skill is very not bad! - Not bad! - Hey. - Come on. - [Meta Spartan] Take out your sun stone, my young friends. (coughing) (laughing) - No more stranger than times of danger. In times of danger, no more a stranger. - I'm Meta Spartan. Protector of the righteous. In times of danger, we won't be strangers. (laughing) (uplifting music) - Yeah! - What? (grunting) (ominous music) - It was not my fault. It was all your idea. - Silence! How dare you blame me for your incompetence! - Incompetence?
