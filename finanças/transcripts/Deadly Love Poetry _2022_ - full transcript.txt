Who has never been pierced by words? No matter how small in their life. If words become love poems... who is not brought to life by them? If poetry could bring life... poetry is surely capable of killing. Always to overcome A thousand tragedies That is my Divine wish In a love story Pray for each other That is my Divine wish Divine wish, a thousand tragedies Divine wish, a thousand tragedies Verily all humans Are nameless We are all Adam and Eve Verily all humans Are nameless We are all Adam and Eve Food is... the universe. Food is... about the mystic and about health. For example this torch ginger, one of the basic spices of the Balinese. We have some radishes. Avocadoes. Please observe each one of them. Avocado has good benefits for our body. However, it is also believed that it carries the power to cast out spirits. Don't forget. Avocadoes are well revered by the Mexicans. Even as far back as 10,000 years. From the ancient civilization of Guatemala. Avocado was a symbol of the calendar. Symbol of sensuality. Its name comes from "Aguacate". Which means... testicles. Life is... about the body. And the spirit. You know I will be by your side. It's natural for me, as long as there's an empty space beside me. Relax. Do you know David Chang? The restaurant group owner and a famous writer. He said... "Everything... is all about cooking. Then... we eat with someone we love." Later I will cook at your home. Yes, please start. As I promised, I will cook at your home. A person's character can be revealed from their bedroom. I want to see it. Just so you know, I always cook with all my heart. If it's for one person... then my whole heart... is for that person. Look. It ripens on your body. Anyone... will ripen with you. Hello? Yeah, okay. Sorry, I have to go to college. I also have to leave the key with the apartment staff. Gosh, hi. Hi, Princess of the Night. We are all servants of the universe. Offering you blood. GET RICH ON MEETING ME Welcome all, my servants to my Hallowe'en event. With my new age... this story begins. I await your offering of blood. But you can't follow me, wait here. Where did you get that? Don't joke around. Of course you gave it to me. You tempting devil. Honey, baby... Honey. Hey... After the party, okay? Tonight I will summon all the demons. To our bed. Let everything become a horror. You adore me with your words and body. My pores are like an oasis of life. Beautiful desires in every hole. Now you've discarded those praises. Blood is flowing from my body. Like the lick of lava. The devil burns you. You deceitful man. Gosh! My beloved, I give you a kiss of death. The masterpiece... from my beloved. Only a chef, my lover. Who can create his own face. FIRE AT A PARTY Are you all right? Leave! Please come to my studio. Ranum? "Please drink my secret poison. I will make you fall in love." SPECIAL CRIME DETECTION SEMINAR PSYCHOLOGY AND CRIME Imagine. These seductive words... were spread by the most prolific rapist in British history. The perpetrator used an anesthetic before committing his rapes. He even kept around 250 to 300 recordings of his victims. The total of reported victims is 48 people. However, it is estimated that he has violated 195 people. The perpetrator, known as the biggest sexual predator in British history... is an Indonesian citizen. His name is Reynhard and lived in Manchester, England. And at that time, he was studying for his Doctoral Degree. Let's look at the 1998 case, there was Rian from Jombang. Mincing and killing, burning his victims. What did he do this for? Because he felt hurt and disappointed. He felt relieved by killing them. There was also Siswanto, aka Robot Gedek. Who killed 12 children. Nine to 15 years old, he split open their stomachs. Drinking their blood. Keeping the victim's limbs as mementos. Hello, Ma'am? Are you all right, Ranum? I've seen your fashion videos. They're great. I'm not feeling well, Ma'am. What is it? All that's left is your final assignments, then your final exam. Aren't they finished? I'm not ready yet, Ma'am. I am not ready. I understand. But you had nothing to do with that incident. Police and campus authorities have clearly proven, you were at the studio when the incident happened. So don't sweat it, Ranum. You don't have to go to the campus, we can talk at my studio. Yes Ma'am, thank you. I pray, I pray... I pray... I pray! They sew to bring beauty to other human beings. And to support their families. They see for years and years, curves of the human body. Curves of the body that are not just physical. But the feelings in the body that wears them. So they are able to understand the bodies and the feelings of my customers. This is beauty. Always from bleeding wounds. Look, Ranum. The beauty of the body. Always formed by those who have been scarred throughout this life. Thank you, Ms. Suri. You have no wounds. I want to make a dress for you. Lie down. I'm not a model, Ma'am. I don't deserve it. My way of teaching is like this. Likewise I rate my students. My body is stiff, Ma'am. Sorry, don't choose me. I don't sew fabrics. I sew feelings within your curves. There's a Chinese story about Yue Lao. The goddess of matchmaking, a symbol of marriage and fidelity. By tying a red string around the leg. In Japan, it's tied upon the finger. A pledge of allegiance between two humans' little fingers. If one is being unfaithful... the finger will be cut off. If you want to finish your work, just go home. Tonight you can come here to watch the fashion show. It won't be good if you don't come. Is your beloved husband not coming? I've paid for his vacation, as far as possible. So that I don't have to see him. I've left him. For you. I've looked for lace fabrics. Designing is not only seen as a whole. But it must be able to make everyone revel in the beauty of your body. So then when Ellen walks, the males will peek at your body. In between the silk flowers. That was sewn by Indian ladies. Who are used to presenting their finest fabrics to the British royals. Is your beauty... only able to be peeked at? I'm the one who has the right to enter into my fabric. Keep straight. Why didn't you come? You will never graduate! Didn't I tell you that it would be a bad luck if you don't come? After I tied the red thread. You fool! I don't sew fabric. I sew the body. And feelings. You've broken my heart. Because my heart is a delicate drop of blood. Blood splattered like red wine. Poured from a human's severed neck. Every drop... becomes... the devil's seeds. Verily all humans Are nameless We are all Adam And Eve Always to overcome A thousand tragedies That is my Divine wish Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! You have the soul of a devil, you are a murderer! Ranum often tells stories. Laksmi, you are more than her aunt. You're like a mother to her. When her mom chose to live in London with her new husband. Let's pray. Pray, pray... - God. - Pray, pray... - Give us Your peace. - Pray, pray... Pray, pray... - Don't let the devil live in my soul. - Pray, pray... Pray, pray... Ranum? I'm not the devil, I'm not the devil. I'm not the devil. - Mom said I could control my emotions. - Ranum... - I'm not a devil, I'm not a devil... - Ranum. Mom, forgive me. Mom, forgive me. I'm not the devil, I'm not the devil. I'm not the devil. I'm not the devil. Thank you, Anna. - Anna? - Yeah? - Thank you. - Yeah. For being Ranum's counselor. She really needs someone aside from her family. Often she locks herself in her room, busy with her college work. Well, yeah. Her fashion work is like her dialogue partners. We are Adam and Eve. But without the apple. With durian fruit, mixed rice, and sugar-apples. We are Adam and Eve. We're couples, embracing, crying, slaughtering. We are Adam and Eve. On steep roads, looking for love for our lives. Therefore I will always find you. Even if I have to overcome millions of tragedies like the stories in the scriptures. Guys, today we have a guest who likes to sing my poems. How about we listen to her voice right now? Applause, please. Just relax. I have always wanted To be with you That is my Divine wish Despite a thousand dramas Inside it That is my Divine wish Maybe you will see me as weird after this, Hayat. But I always feel like someone is next to me. She's always there when I'm sad, or when I'm sick. I can even talk to her and... we have our own language. Everyone has souls that accompany them. And that soul lives in our umbilical cord. Therefore the umbilical cord must be protected. She will always come. Just accept it. Hayat, I need to go to the toilet. Hayat. Let's play hide and seek. One, two, three, four... Five, six, seven... Eight, nine, ten. Ranum? Ranum? Where are you? - Hayat. - Huh? I'm here. Huh? DEVIL The police already have the people behind the attack against Ranum. It turns out that they are members of sects obliged to exorcize the devil from Earth. Yes, I know. Our family has always been called the devil's family. But you don't have to worry. Let the universe decide on her birthday. I'm worried. Everything will end up being violent. Those are invisible signs. Yes, but the signs should still be visible I don't believe in ghosts. Violence is what haunts our lives. Everything in life is like the story of Adam and Eve. Paired. There is a world of black, white. Positive, negative. Rational and mystical. Like this Balinese cloth. Good and bad, they coexist side by side. Like Barong and Rangda. Thank you. Both are within the human soul. That's why we put offerings in various places. In honor of these two souls. Including the black souls. If we don't place it properly, it is possible that the black souls will use human souls to destroy life. Two universes within... The great and the small I am that You are me I'm white and black I'm dark and light I am left I am right Black and white In balance Black and white In balance ‪Black and white ‪In balance How is it going? My heart has been Blossoming like flowers My soul has been Pruning tree branches And so are we MY HEART IS BLOOMING, LIKE FLOWER PETALS. PLEASE INVENT A POEM USING THE WORD "GLANCE". IS IT OBVIOUS THAT I GLANCE AT YOU ALL THE TIME? IF YOU DON'T MAKE ME THE POEM, YOU CAN'T GLANCE AT ME AGAIN. This cornfield used to belong to my father. Now, I take care of it. Why is it that ghosts are always female? Grandma Lampir. The creeping nun. Why isn't there a Grandpa Lampir? Or a creeping priest? But women are suitable to be ghosts. Hayat. This is a poem from my childhood comic book. My poems Are spells From the mouths of The inhabitants of the universe I keep them in a black wooden box Away from forest fires and soot In a hundred volcanoes of the archipelago Sister! Where are you, Sister? Hayat... I know this place. I know this place, Hayat. I know this place. Ranum. Ranum... What's wrong? I know this place. Ranum... Calm down. Pop culture, such as radio plays and comics, is famous for its cruel poetry. Like The Bloody Poetry Warrior in Tutur Tinular... which is currently popular on social media The bloody poetry is a release of violence and disappointment in life. For radio listeners and comic book readers from their daily lives. Heinous murders often occur because the perpetrator suffers from an acute pathology. Their psychology has been disturbed. But some people look at it from a biological aspect, genetic. Something that is hereditary regarding chromosomes. And other conditions they've had since birth. Including brain function, physiology, anatomy. What else, hormonal? I've always been scared like this, Hayat. Everything will be disastrous. Hey... Why must we always have traumas? I don't want to write using that pencil from my father. Because it always reminds me of the news. About that plane that caught fire on landing. Everything turned to blood. Everything turned to blood? Ah, enough of that. Let's forget about it. I just bought some books. These are vintage poetry comics. You can look. The Bloody Poetry Warrior. I didn't order this. I think I know this poetry. "You adore me with your words and body. My pores are like an oasis of life. Beautiful desire in every hole. Now you discarded those praises. My pores become blood-filled wounds. My heart and body..." There, there. Hello, Ma'am We have a new case. Wahyudi, 18 years old. Addicted to online games. Then he took R's life, a nine-year-old boy who turned out to be his own nephew. Just to grab his cell phone to play online games. I have sent the files, Ma'am. Working as a supervisor for violent cases in the Police. Sometimes it's exhausting. Violence. Violence. Violence is everywhere. Reminds me of my childhood. Anna, how come you haven't done anything yet? Hey! Why can't you even do something so simple? Remember, stay focused! I'm working. I work hard so you can stay in school. Look at me. You have to be a smart kid! Independent! Just like me. You cannot depend on anyone. I don't depend on your father! My mother pushed me very hard. After my father remarried and left us. Come on. Answer! How I hate my mother so much. Sometimes I want to stab her with the pencil she used to stab my hand. In high school... I decided to live alone. But my fate changed, when I was teaching at a university. As a psychology lecturer. My mother got cancer. She asked me to come home for months, but I didn't want to. Until one day she wrote me a message. "Come home, Child. I just want to wash your hands." I'm home. Your hands are beautiful. I should have caressed your hands when I helped you study. Forgive me. Forgive me. No more violence. Against you. Or against anyone. Alright? It's all over, Anna. You're now a well known psychologist. Your mother must be happy. You are good at voicing what your mother wanted to say. IS LIFE NOT LIKE HIDE AND SEEK? ALWAYS SOMETHING HIDDEN AND TO BE FOUND. Sis. Let's play. Sis. Come on. One, two, three. Four, five, six. Seven, eight. Nine, ten. Sis, where are you going? Sis, where are you going? Sister? Sister? Sister? Sister? Come on, Sis. I hate it when Mom and Dad fight! Many people tell stories. About our family. Our family is called... the devil's family, a cursed family. - I am not the devil's child. - You're the devil's child! Just lock her up, let's do it! Open the door! Open up! I'm not the devil's child. Open the door! Please open the door! Especially after the divorce in families where men leave the home. Yes, I read it in newspaper clippings. Your family has... Supernatural powers? Yes, our family has been known for generations to have supernatural powers. All humans have great energy. But sometimes it can be destructive. If we can't control ourselves in certain situations. Like what I experienced as a child. Frequently bullied and locked up. Because they considered me a child of the devil. Strangely, our family members are always divided into two. Either they become spiritual teachers. Or live a chaotic life full of problems and violence. The story of Ranum's family is very complicated. They always had huge fights when their twin daughters were born. Huh? They were twins? BIRTH CERTIFICATES RANTING - RANUM How come you never told me? Things would be different, Laksmi. How did they get separated? Ever since Ranum and Ranting were four years old... they loved to play outdoors. One... Two... They didn't want to see their mom and dad fighting violently. Six, seven... Eight, nine, ten. They loved to play hide and seek together. Sister? Sister? Sister? The curse seemed to repeat itself. Ranum's parents' fight exploded out of control. While Ranum and Ranting were playing hide and seek. Sis? Where are you, Sister? Ranting... Sister Ranting! - Sister! - Ranum! - Sister! - Ranum! Ranum! Ranum and her mother never knew about Ranting's condition and fate. Ranum herself... She was still too young to remember all of that. Their entire past had been erased. Ranum only knows that she was an only child. Since then, Ranum became a loner. She lives only with her mannequin. She doesn't like to hang out with anyone. Every day, she talked to the mannequin in their own language. Twins help each other. They solve problems their own way and with their own language. Well, curses always come to Ranum's family. People here think that twins are two personalities, the good one and the bad one. It's all a misunderstanding. Twins are not black and white. They help each other, complete each other. Imagine, since they were two weeks old they've been embracing each other in their mother's womb. Take a look at this case. The case of twins, wrapped by their umbilical cord, hugging each other. CASE OF TWINS Or take a look at this one. THE TWINS WERE HUGGING, WRAPPED BY THE UMBILICAL CORD Kissing each other whilst inside the womb. ‪BABIES KISSING EACH OTHER ‪WHILST INSIDE THE WOMB I'm worried about Ranum. I still believe in telepathy. Even between spirits, the living and the dead. Ranum and Ranting were entangled in the umbilical cord at birth. They share many of the same habits together. Like imitating The Bloody Poetry Warrior. Or listening to our family's favorite radio plays. Even play-acting as murderers. Despite our scoldings, they still did it. I told you many times not to read this Bloody Poetry Warrior comic book. Well, cases of twins can vary. This is a unique and extreme example. Twins have a language to communicate, so they can feel isolated. But when one dies, the other feels liberated and lives a normal life in society. Wait a minute. - Hello? - Miss Anna, we got it. Criminal news file, probably related to the Ranum's case. - We shared it with you. - Oh, right. - Yes, I'll check it. - Right. GIRL FOUND DEAD, HANGED HERSELF IN MEDAN - What? - Laksmi... Do you really believe... that spirits will be reunited in real life? That twins have their own telepathy and language to communicate? - Are you sure? - I'm certain. HAYAT, TOMORROW IS MY BIRTHDAY. WOULD YOU WRITE A POEM USING THAT PENCIL FROM YOUR FATHER? SO THE PENCIL CAN LIGHT UP YOUR SPIRIT. DON'T EVER BELIEVE MEN'S WORDS DIE! DIE! DIE! Ranum. I just received news from Laksmi. That you have a twin sister. Her name is Ranting. How come I've just found out now? So your name is Ranting, Sis. How come I've just found out now? Why didn't I help you? How come I've just found out now? Ranting! Ranting! Why didn't I protect you, Sister? Sister, how come I've just found out now? Why... Ranum. You have to accept the reality about your sister. Accept your sister's soul. It exists as you exist. She just want to go back to the way she was born. The way you two hugged each other on your birthday. The universe is a womb. Accept it. Aren't you worried? I'm worried. You know, Anna, I can't have kids. They're like my own. Life is in pairs There is good and bad There are men There are women Some are born Some die Some things are real Some things are unreal There is love and there is hate There is existence, there is nothingness There is me There is me There is you Ranting? Ranting? Where are you going? Ranting. Don't go. This is your favorite song. Some things are real Some things are unreal There is love There is hate There is existence There is nothingness There is me There is you Happy... Birthday We sing it Wishing you A long life We will pray for you We wish you Prosperity And a healthy life Wishing you A long life and... Sister. Happy birthday... Sister... Sister... Sister... Sister. It's been years, I... I never felt alone, Sis. There was always someone. It turned out that... It was you, Sis. It was you. I am very happy, I can meet you again. I am very happy. I am very happy, we can celebrate birthdays together. Happy birthday, Ranting. Happy birthday, Sister. Sister... Sister... Sister... What do you want, Sis? DON'T BELIEVE A MAN'S WORDS. DIE, DIE, DIE! Sister. Mom said no more violence. No more violence. Sister. I understand. Your wound is my wound too. So please... Please, no more violence. Please, Sis. This is Ranum's favorite cake. Hey! Hey, who are you? Hey, what do you want? - I'm scared! I don't want to see blood. - Anna. - I don't want to see! - Anna! Anna. You must have the courage to accept reality. Take a deep breath! Go on, open your eyes! Come on. Come on, Anna! Let's clean it, you can do this. Come on. Come on, calm down. Let's clean it, you can do it. Anna! Come on. Come on, clean it. Calm down. Take a deep breath! Hayat, write with your father's pencil. Write, Hayat. Come write, Hayat. Come write, Hayat. Write. Be brave to write beautiful words. Be like a tree, growing freely. Come on, Hayat. Hayat... Write, Hayat. You have to be brave. Be brave. Start writing. Sister, what are you doing? Sister, stop it. Sister, stop it. Write, Hayat. Hayat, come on. Sister. Hayat. Hayat, come on, write. Hayat, write it. Sister, don't. Sister, stop it. Please stop it. Sister... I will leave. No more violence. I don't want Hayat to be cursed, Sis. Hayat. Don't write, Hayat. Don't write. Hayat, stop it. Sis, I'm leaving. I don't want him to die. Hayat, stop it. Hayat, stop it. Hayat. Hayat, stop. I... I'm leaving. Realized... Sis... Don't go. I don't want any more goodbyes, Sis. Here we have love. Here we have love. REALIZED LIFE EXIST "Words of love... must be realized. For life to exist." I wrote this poem in pencil. For my lover. Ranting. NINE MONTHS AGO The lyrics, I slowly picked from her heart. This pencil will be... flowers for the listeners of this song. I have always wanted To be with you That is my Divine wish Despite a thousand dramas inside it That is my Divine wish Verily all humans are nameless We are all Adam and Eve To always overcome a thousand tragedies That is my Divine wish In the sacred book of love Pray for each other That is my Divine wish Divine wish A thousand tragedies Divine wish A thousand tragedies Verily all humans are nameless We are all Adam and Eve Verily all humans Are nameless We are all Adam and Eve Verily all humans Are nameless We are all Adam and Eve Verily all humans Are nameless We are all Adam and Eve We are all Adam and Eve ‪INSPIRED BY A BOOK OF LOVE POEMS ‪BY GARIN NUGROHO, ‪ADAM, HAWA, DAN DURIAN
