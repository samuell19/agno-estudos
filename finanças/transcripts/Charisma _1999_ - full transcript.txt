NIKKATSU CO., KING RECORDS CO. AND TOKYO THEATRES CO. PRESENT CHARISMA Yabuike. Hey, Yabuike. Oh... Yes. - Up all night? - Yes. The suspect confessed hours ago. Oh, I see. Where are you going? Have to do the paperwork. I've already got it. You can sit down. Your wife okay? Yes. And your son? Probably. I want you to take some time off. At least next week. No, I'm fine. You can start tomorrow. I'm fine. Officer Yabuike, he's got a member of parliament. Please proceed carefully. "Restore the Rules of the World" I understand. I'll give them your message. Yabuike, Yabuike. Oh, yes. The hospital called. They're both dead. Suspect and hostage both. I see. Why didn't you kill him? Of all people, it had to be a member of parliament. I wanted to help them both. How can you help a lunatic? At the time, I thought they both deserved help. Why? I can't explain. One of the Rules of the World? Sit down. We wound up losing them both. Yes. I should've sent you on vacation sooner. Where to, sir? Anywhere. You take things too seriously. The system's not set up for it. That's all, really. Say, don't you have to call home? Hi, Shinji? Is your mother home? Oh, okay. Can you give her a message? I've gotten busy and won't be home for a while. Yeah. Bye now. Look, Nakasone. It's happened again. You just planted it three days ago. Yeah. As soon as you plant them, they die. You're a pro, right? It's dead. If you don't do something about this, we'll be stuck here forever. Please. What the fuck is it with this forest? Hey, you want some juice? Oh, yes. Thanks. Why'd you come here? There weren't any buses. I see. Got lost on a walk? Something like that, I guess. This stuff puckers your mouth. Made from wild grapes. Well, that's it for the questions. Everybody here's got some story. - Nakasone, can I borrow a man? - No. I just need a quick hand. You can't use my guys like that. I'm Tsuboi, from Environmental Protection. I'm Yabuike. - Are you from the city? - Yes. Taking a walk in the woods? Yeah, well. You what they call a drop out? Don't get upset. I don't know your story, but I understand. Time to rediscover yourself in the great outdoors, right? Can you hold this for a minute? What do you make of that tree? What do I make of it? Without the paraphernalia, the tree itself is nothing special. That's what you'd think, right? But it's not true. We believe it's a type of bush clover. First time I've seen one. It could be rare, or maybe just a mutation. Thanks, you can let go now. Hey, don't. That's private property there. Let's go back Yabuike. This could get dangerous. There's a young man who drives off anyone who goes near this tree. You could call him ferocious. Where does the guy live? Maybe deeper in the woods. Hey, it's dangerous in there. I'm a cop. My things were stolen last night. Maybe he did it. Excuse me. Oh, that you, Yabuike? Where are you? Hey, are you listening? Your vacation?s been extended... forever. Come back and turn in your badge and gun. Hey, Yabuike. Hey. Hey. Grand Hotel. Checking in. Excuse me. What? If these mean that much to you, you can have them back. But... I'm taking your soul, instead. I hear you?re a cop. What the hell's a cop doing here? Don't eat that crap. What the hell are you doing? Yabuike. Where did you get this? I wonder. It was in your pocket. Probably in the woods. Do you remember where? Here you go, here. Found one! A magic mushroom. Good job, Yabuike. A cop's gotta have a good nose. These mushrooms are fantastic! The earth's spinning! I'll use him next. As long as we keep him fed. I know something about training dogs. Watch out. One false move and he'll bite. The coast is clear. All right. Let's get busy. The roots are extensive. Tsuboi. What's wrong with these guys? We met the other night. So what? You're not a ghost. - What are you doing here? - Whatever. What's this? A tree. Isn't it obvious? So it is. Done. This branch died. It was doing just fine. This tree's in better shape than the others. - What did you do to it? - Nothing. Don't lie to me. I didn't do anything. Hey! Don't touch that! I'm going home. You carry the stuff. You watch it! Hey, wait. You walk too fast, man. You listen to me. Don't order me around like a dog. I didn't come to this forest for food. I get it. I just said it wrong. You got that right. You want help, try being polite. What is this place? The food's all foraged. Thanks. Say, what's your name? Kiriyama. Kiriyama, I'm - I know. It said on your badge. Goro Yabuike, a cop, right? Yeah. That doesn't matter here. You're right. She's the director's widow. This used to be a sanitarium. Something wrong? What? No. Don't look at me like that. The tree's called Charisma. Charisma? It's probably the only one. That's what the director said. Do you understand magnificence? No. Someone larger than life. Someone on a different scale. The director was like that. He died three years ago. I've been taking care of the tree ever since. But, I wonder why... it just seems to get weaker and weaker. I treat it the same way. Why is that? I don't know much about plants either. Right. Hey. You can touch it. You sure? It'll live for thousands of years. Who'll take care of it after us? Are you okay? Yes, but I can't get this off. I'll take it right off. Thank you. It's a trap for large animals. Poachers set them. I've dismantled lots of them. Are you okay? Can you walk? Yes, I can manage. There you go. I really appreciate it. Walking in the woods can be dangerous. One step off the road and who knows. What's your name? Oh, Yabuike. Yabuike. I'm Jinbo. Nice to meet you. It was sick, but it's recovering quite nicely. - Is your leg okay? - Oh, it's fine. Oh, thanks. By the table there. Oh, thank you. Do you study plants and things? Yes. Musashino University. - So you're a professor. - Yes. Would you like to listen to this? Hear that hissing sound? That's the tree absorbing water. It's an indication of health. I had no idea. As long as it hisses steadily, everything's fine. Listen to this one. Breaks or pauses mean the plant's weak. Do you follow? Can I borrow this? I just need it for a day. Jinbo, huh. Yeah. Did she try to convert you? Not particularly. You can't trust her. She's harmless, but full of theories. I ignore her. Listen, in the woods, all you have are this, this, and this. Don't you forget that. Well, you'll figure it out soon enough. Yabuike-san. Hello. Thanks for the loan. - Was it helpful? - Yes. - Will you come in for a cup of tea? - Oh, no thanks. She's my sister. Chizuru! This is Yabuike, someone I met. It's pressurized air, so it can explode on impact. - Please be careful. - I'm sorry. I had no idea, really. I always thought the forest was peaceful and quiet. But that's hardly the case. Huh? What do you mean? There seem to be so many forces at work. For instance? For instance, forces trying to live, forces trying to kill... What exactly do you mean? I've actually seen it. A tree that's on the verge of death, clinging to life. A young tree just keeling over. The forces of life and destruction? Yes, well. But aren't they the same thing? Well, I guess. One destroys the other so it can live. In other words, killing to survive? Sounds complicated. Complicated? You started this discussion. Yes, I know. May I? Certainly. What is it? I know about you, Yabuike. Because I'm the one that dragged you from the burning car. This is a horrible place. Foul-smelling ozone, ultra-violet rays. Then there are poisonous weeds, snakes and bugs. Poison everywhere. I'm fed up with it. Why did you help me? You'd have died if I hadn't. I guess you're right. - I shouldn't have? - No, you did right. Please remember. I'm the one who chose you. Yabuike. Oh, hi. - Picking wild vegetables? - Yes. Um, I think you'd better not. The wild fruits and vegetables in this area are bad for you. They contain powerful carcinogens. I see. Over time, the effects may be lethal. We just got some groceries in town. You're welcome to some. Chizuru. Kiriyama? I'm in pain. I haven't slept at all since last night. If I could only be relieved of this pain. Take a deep breath and exhale. Take a deep breath and exhale. Okay, guys. Take it apart. Don't touch that! - I'll kill you all. - Hold it, man! That's dangerous. You son of a bitch! You're next! Come here! Come after me, man! Kiriyama, that thing's dangerous. Oh, Yabuike to the rescue? Pretty tough. A cop after all. Nakasone, you get the picture. Don't come here anymore. Okay, okay, I get it. But tell me, Yabuike. What is this thing? Is it that valuable? It's just a normal tree. Hey, man. What are you going to do? - Going to do? - With them. Nothing. Who's side are you on, Yabuike? I'm not on anyone's side. - You going to betray me? - That's not it. What the fuck? We're outta here. Hey, kid. I won't forget this. Time to head back? Yeah. Don't abandon me, okay? When did you get home, dear? I just picked some of your favorite wild mushrooms. How are the patients doing? Oh, I almost forgot. There's something I wanted to tell you today. Of course, you're the most important person here, you're the director. Everyone idolizes you. I know that, dear. But each of the patients should have their own freedom. Especially, Kiriyama. He's still young. And he's learned so much here. But you never taught him to be free. You should have. Kiriyama also has his own world away from here. Don't you think it's about time to set him free? In my college research, I studied every individual plant. But I never discovered anything. It's the same with the people here. They see value in individual trees, but no one's looking at the whole forest. Is the conflict really that serious? Yes, actually. What's the issue? I think because that tree is so compelling. - Compelling? - Yes. Kiriyama calls it Charisma. That is the name of a tree, though not its botanical name. What do you think, Yabuike? Me? I don't really know. I feel I should do something. What something? Kiriyama told me that tree will live for thousands of years. Someone's got to protect it. Everyone's got it wrong. You, too. The director brought that tree over from the continent. It's an unusual species. What type is it? It's a kind of monster. It produces an extraordinarily virulent toxin. Haven't you noticed how all the trees near it have withered? It's because of that tree, Charisma. Do you know about ecosystems? I've heard of them. It refers to life cycles in the natural world. From that perspective, Charisma is extremely hazardous. I'll start by telling you about the whole forest. This forest was once dominated by beech trees. The botanical term for the condition is "climax." It was a beautiful, perfect forest, in its way. That's how it used to be. When Charisma was introduced, the trees suddenly began to waste away. An unbelievable pace toward extinction. The problem is Charisma's roots secrete a toxin. Charisma isn't choosy about how it survives. Although it looks weak, it's poisoning the other trees, so that it alone will thrive. But it's strange. Instead of fighting Charisma, the other plants seem drawn in its direction and then they die off, the young ones first. Almost as though they've been drugged. That's how vicious that tree is, Yabuike. Left alone, the whole forest will die. It's about time for you to decide which side you're on. That's what I think. Isn't there a way to save both? Both? The forest and Charisma, both. That's impossible. No way. Leave me alone. You're the one dredging up other people's problems. This has nothing to do with you. What'd Jinbo teach you this time? "Think about the forest, that tree is a monster" sort of thing? She's wrong. Dead wrong. That's just some theory invented by humans. The forest is a battlefield. All kinds of plants live and die. If Charisma alone survives, if that's the rule, that's just how it is, right? The strong survive, that's the rule here. I like it better that way. So you save the whole forest. You're only doing it for yourself. Good for quiet walks in the woods? What good is that? People only think of themselves. So self-serving. It's a complete mess. My goal is to restore the rules of the forest. Which are probably the rules of the world. See what I mean? For that, you need force. Which is why I need you. Don't tell me you came to these woods looking for freedom. No. Of course not. Freedom's just another disease. A truly healthy human longs to obey. You understand. You're a cop. Yabuike, it's about time you came over to our side. What are you going to do? Everyone's waiting to see what you'll do. The water in this well feeds the entire forest. So I hear. What do you think this stuff is? I hear it's a chemical to improve the soil. It's poison. Poison. Only to the plants, of course. My sister's been dumping it in the well for a year. Why? She's planning to kill the forest. Says it's the only way to restore the original ecosystem. That's why all the trees are dying. She's crazy. Don't take her seriously. Yabuike, isn't the whole thing starting to seem a little ridiculous? Anyone who spends time here will go nuts, right? It's an hour's walk to the nearest town. Catch a train and you're back in the city. I see. Don't you have things to do? Right. Not that way. The town's over there. Did you by any chance, also set the car on fire? Help me. I need your help. A trap? I'll set you right free. We've been expecting you. I'm Tsuboi. I'm Nekojima. - And that's Nakasone. - Hello. What do you think? It's not that far. We can get in pretty close by truck. - So it's really valuable? - Yeah, well... Let's get ready. - Were the pictures helpful? - Yes. Thank you. Who wants such a tree? Collectors. Sometimes botanical gardens. What kind of price? They're not cheap. Tsuboi, don't worry. You'll get your cut. Aren't you overdoing it? There are sometimes dangerous animals. Oh, I see. Got some around here? Yeah. Ours are a special breed. Wow, that tough, huh? What is it? A flat, damn it. They got us. This'll take a little while. We'll go on then. Let's scout around while we wait. I'm going back. What the hell? You did it! - Did you kill him? - Just shot him in the leg. We better run. Oh, dear. Oh, please. Hey, I've had it. I've never been shot. Does it hurt? What? All done? Yeah. We didn't come here to hunt. Hey, Nishi. Nishi. Let's go to the woods. I found another one. Could be a Charisma. You want to see it, right? Want to go see it? Come on. Hey, what's the point of this? Point? There's no point. I'm just trying to bring this guy back to life. But this isn't Charisma. You think not? Then what will you do? What do you mean do? This guy might live for thousands of years. It's too much. I just can't figure it out. No? Hey. Come back anytime. There's another Charisma. What? This isn't what you think it is. I see. Unfortunately, it's just another tree. Then what are you going to do? What do you mean do? Will you keep it alive or will you kill it? Whatever. This tree has no impact on the forest as a whole. What is it, then? I said it's just another dead tree. But if it recovers, it may start killing others again. No, it won't. Are you sure? What's your point? No point. I won't stop you, though. Professor. Come back some time for a look. Who is it!? What are you up to, Yabuike? What are your plans for everyone? You can tell me, at least. Take me with you. It doesn't matter where. Come along if you like. What is this? An old tree. - Are you teasing me? - No. This isn't what I had in mind. Where, then? The world, the outside world. This is part of it. You're not normal, are you? I'm very normal. What are your plans? It seems... an average man can only do average things. I hate average. I don't want to be like that. If you had to choose between one special tree and the whole forest, which would you choose? It's a very difficult question. But there's really only one answer. Both have to survive. The will to live and the will to kill are the same. So your sister says. So, what to do? If one lives, the other dies. If both try to live, both may die. There is no right answer. Or rather, the problem is in the way the question is posed. Both are trying to live so both should live. That's the way things are. If each kills the other, it means extinction. That's also how things are. But that would mean chaos. Kiriyama says that rules and force can prevent that. That was my line of work. I did it without a second thought. But I finally understand. I'm fine just as I am, an average man. That's plenty. There weren't any special trees and there wasn't any whole forest. Just a lot of average trees, growing everywhere. That's all there ever was. Then, what is it that you're trying to do? Letting some live, killing others. Just the way things are. I don't understand. Here's ten million. A deposit from the client. Just arrived. Tempted? By what? You can have it. Why? But we get the tree. This tree belongs here. Stubborn, aren't you? Do as you like. I don't want money. Fine. You're an idiot. Wait. I understand. I'll give you this tree. Do as you like. Hey? You've just been had. Tsuboi. The deal's done. Hey, don't touch that tree. Get away. Farther away. I'll be right back. Don't go near that thing. There's no way out of these woods. Shut up. Keep walking. Nakasone, I'm hungry. So fucking what? Don't, you idiot! It could be poisonous! It's really good, Nakasone. Oh, I'm sorry. I got lost in the woods. Could I have a glass of water? I'm leaving. Right. Look after the tree. You're Charisma. See ya. This is hell. You hate this tree that much? It's just a dead tree. I think this is just the beginning. I'm leaving. Thanks for everything. Don't touch that! That's mine. I'll kill you all. But first, Yabuike, pull that up by the roots. Be careful. Don't damage it. Hey, wait. Throw me your gun. Don't aim it at me. Toss it here. She'll die, idiot! Relax. I won't kill you. I need your first-aid kit. Don't die. You can't die. Don't you dare die. I'll get you to a hospital. That bud is yours, professor. Let it live, let it die. It's up to you. Can I come with you guys? Hey, boss. Yabuike? What have you done? What on earth have you done? I'm returning now.
