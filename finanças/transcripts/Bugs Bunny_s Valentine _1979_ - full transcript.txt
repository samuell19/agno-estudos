I didn't do it, sweetheart. I'm innocent. Oh, no, you're not. You did it, all right. Guilt is written all over your face. Oh? Hm. You did it, and you're glad you did it. You're despicable. Just plain despicable. And, and, and... And you're cute. It'll take more than that to keep Duck Drake from solving this baffling crime. Crime, sweetheart? Nobody's committed any crime. They haven't? Then why--? I ask you, why was I summoned here to the Axe-Handle Estate? Silly boy, the Axe-Handle Estate's a couple of blocks up the street. Then you are innocent. Uh-uh. Sweetheart, I'm guilty.

Well, I gotta hand it to you, Cupid, kid. But I still say you're a meddler. And he who meddles will get caught in his own trap. Bugs boy, have I got a surprise for you.
