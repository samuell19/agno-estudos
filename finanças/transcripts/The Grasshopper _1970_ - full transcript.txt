Only he manages never to get too personal. Well, it's not too funny, but you can't expect brilliance in the middle of the desert. Get in. Hello, Lou. Want me to sit in the back? (Lou) 'No, it's okay.' Here we go. It's called travelling with a star. [instrumental music] (Danny) 'Did six Sullivan shows this year, killed them every time.' - 'I saw you.

You gotta see Las Vegas once in your lifetime. - Right, Lou? - Yeah, it's exciting. - 'I've gotta go--' - 'Yeah, I know.' 'I wanna see my boyfriend, he's a bank clerk' 'from the Kingman Canada mountains.' Honey, it's six o'clock already. You'll be hitchhiking in the desert at midnight. Who's gonna pick you up? A coyote?

[indistinct chattering] Want you to meet my son Julian. Julian, come here. My son Julian. A freshman at Iowa State. This is Bobby Delph. I remember when you were no bigger than a peanut. - That's Vivian's kid? - No, no, my first wife. Ah, yes. Show him you're alive. Shake hands. - Hey, come on, grip. - What do they know in College? Hey, Tommy, Tommy. Hi, Tommy. I hate my father, father. How are the songs coming, huh? Hey, that's my man. - How you feeling? - Hello, Danny. How are you? Hello, Jack. Nice to see you. Say hello to Christine. - Hello, Christine. How are you? - Hello. You're shaking hands with one of the greatest in pro football. (Danny) 'Tommy Marcott. This fella, I wouldn't shake hands with.' 'Jack Benton, big hotel owner.' Was I funny? Was I really funny? You're the only man I can trust, father. Buddy. You were funny. (Danny) 'What do they know from football in Canada?' 'They know soccer, hockey. But football, that's a game.' Hey, Tommy. I want you to meet somebody. Come on. - Excuse me. I'm sorry. - Fine. - You're looking good, Danny. - Thank you, Jack. - Not as good as her though. - Pretty, huh? You had any brains, you'd put her in your shows instead of those barracudas you're using. - I'd hire her before you. - 'Oh, funny, funny, funny.' What are you studying at school? I don't remember. Jack, I'd like you to meet my manager. - Excuse us, Danny. - I'll see you sometime. - 'Nice meeting you.' - Oh, forget her. It's my girl. Loves me. Me she loves. - You hate me. - No, Danny. I like you. - You're a lot of fun. - I know. I'm fun. I'm cute. I have a pixie, pixie quality. You're right. You do. When's the last time you saw a pixie get laid? Danny, I better just go change my clothes and leave. - I'm sorry. I love Eddie. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I understand. Do me a favor, will you? Stick around a few more minutes 'till I fall asleep. I hate to be alone.' 'Oh, yeah.' 'Oh, before I forget...I want you to have this, honey.' - 'I want some money.' - 'Go on, take it.' (Danny) 'It's a hundred bucks, you know.' 'You can fly to Los Angeles instead of hitchhiking.' 'I may be in LA at the Coconut Grove.' - 'Come and see my show.' - 'Good. I'll bring Eddie.' (Danny) 'Yeah, that's just what I need. Eddie.' [guitar music] Hey, Eddie. I'm Christine Adams. I'm 19 and I'm in love. I'm Birdsock and I'm 58 and get to the end of the line. I got you a present. Aw, honey. You didn't have to get me a gift. Open it. You're still the same, aren't you? I love you. Mm, I would've had a gift for you if I knew you were coming. Which reminds me what happened to our plan about you finishing junior college and coming here this summer? I couldn't wait. I got bored. I changed courses four times. The guidance counselor was so mad he wouldn't talk to me. - Eddie, let's have a baby. - Oh, honey. Come on, come on. Let's have a baby. - Eddie, let's have a baby. - Mm, we will, honey. But not right now. I mean, I want to...get my promotion first. (Eddie) 'Want to get a bigger place to live.' 'You've got to be prepared to take care of kids.' 'Then we'll have our baby.' (female #4) 'You're really great, Eddie.' I made Chris take some out the moment she got here. Now, after six months, that stock has risen 11%. (female #4) 'Eleven percent?' - 'Eleven percent.' - 'That's incredible.' (Eddie) 'It sure is.' 'You see, the great thing about mutual fund' 'is that it's not one stock, but it's a series of stocks..' (male #4) 'I'd like to check with the sunset' 'with the surfer coming out of the sunset..' Honey, you're lucky he didn't fire you. Should've seen the look on that man's face. Christine, the bank is a responsible place. Not a playground. You can't play around. I mean, back.. [telephone ringing] Hello? Mr. Molina speaking. 'Uh, yes, it does take three days to clear, ma'am' 'but that reference is to bank working days only.' I'm going for a walk. Swell, honey.

'Standing room, last night got big applause' 'with the birth control bit' 'and then topped it with the fag hockey player routine.' 'Yeah, yeah. That's right.' 'Friday open. You're gonna be there, aren't you?' 'Ringside table? You got it, pal.' Okay, see you then. I gotta go now, Marv. There's a gorgeous girl just dying for my body. Yeah. Kidding? Who's kidding? Marv, the other phone's ringing. - Who is that? - Ah, just a friend. Got him a ringside table for my opening in Miami beach. Oh. So, you are going to Miami this week, huh? - Ah, that was the, "Oh," huh? - Mm-hm. Yep, Miami bound. I only work Vegas three weeks at a time. Three weeks are up. That's the trouble with this goddamn business. You never in one town long enough. You want to go to Miami beach with me? - Could I? - Sure. Oh, wow. Fantastic. Yeah. - Damn. - What's the matter? Ah, nothing, just the ex-wife is coming down with the kids for a couple of days. I better make arrangements for the plane tickets. I wish I hadn't blown all the loot in the blackjack tables. Little low on dough. I'll have, uh, Lou make the arrangements. It's better that way. - Hey, what the hell I'll call. - Danny, don't call. - Why not? - Let's just forget it. What do you mean? Make up your mind. First you say, you wanna go. Now, you don't wanna go. - I don't wanna go. - You don't wanna go. Maybe you're better off. I've no life. 'You know with me it's all up in the air.' 'Maybe in a couple of months, huh?' Sure. 'Need some money? Believe me, you're much better off.' 'You stay in Vegas. Nice with the lights.' 'Beautiful here. Lot of classy people.' [indistinct chattering] (male #5) 'Honey, just put the chip down on the table.' (female #5) 'Now what happens?' (male #5) 'Well, put another dollar.' (Christine) 'So, you do remember me.' I remember you. From the party. Who can forget Danny's dates? He makes sure everybody sees when he has a winner. But I don't remember offering you a job. Well, you said you were always replacing girls. Yeah, we got openings but, uh, you ever been on a stage? Oh, yes. I did "Little Women" in school. Nude? - What did you say? - Did you do it nude, naked? Forget it. Look, honey, you're really not built right. But was I built better at the party? She's got a mouth, Arnold. No, but at parties I come on with every girl. Mr. Benton, I just wanna earn some money. Then I'll go back to LA and maybe get my teaching degree. Good idea. I wanna try this for a while. I mean, I've seen the shows. It doesn't look too hard. Baby, you're right. It doesn't take much talent. But you have to be built a certain way. You keep saying that. What do you mean? I mean, showgirls gotta have gigantic tickets. Tickets? Yeah, gigantic tickets. - Would you like me to come-- - Cut, cut. Are you trying to tell me my breasts aren't big enough? Hey, they're fine with me. I mean, I'm an, uh, an aesthetic guy. But these morons from out of town they come into Vegas, they wanna see freaks. In my hometown I was considered one of the overdeveloped girls. In your hometown, Arnold would be built. If they want me grotesque they can always pad my costume. What costume? Those girls wear nothing but smiles and little pasties. How are you gonna pad a pasty? Lots of things you can fake. Dancing, cocktail waitress. Nobody notices. Nobody cares. But when it comes to tickets there is no faking. Every man is an expert. There's nothing wrong with my tickets. How'd you like to go to dinner tonight? I'd rather have a job. You got a lot of spunk. Arnold, get up here. Would you pay 12.50 minimum to look at those? Thank you, Arnold. Welcome to Bonanza Palace. [applause] 'Production design by Shawn Kenny.' [orchestral music] 'Music composed..'

The first time I went on I almost fell off the dumb hat. Kyo, pick the hat for my costume, huh? Hurrying. I'm hurrying. Come on, come on. Hustle it up. One of the bears got sick. They're doing a shorter act. - Was I alright? - Sure. You'll be fine. They're only two kinds of girls in this line. Great dancers and the girls with friends. Jack Benton is your friend you're automatically a great dancer. Hey, you know you were wonderful tonight. You're very pretty and you got a lovely body. If you need anything, just ask Marie. Hey, relax. Marie's kind of the show's welcome wagon. Just set her straight, she won't bother you. [orchestral music] [singing in foreign language] (male #7) 'Pull in 35, pull in 36, pull in 37.

You just follow me, come on. Looks like Gigi's slumming tonight. - Is she that blonde over there? - Mm-hmm. Like this table, honey? If you want it, we can sit on that goddamn stage. (male #8) 'Hey, waitress.' She's beautiful. Is she in one of the shows? (Buck) 'No, no, no.' 'Gigi is one of the most famous hustlers in Vegas.' - Is she a prostitute? - No, silly. Look, she can make more money standing around the crap table 'than she could lying on her back.' 'Hustlers are the high class girls. They get gifts.' (Christine) 'Does she go to bed with the guys?' (Buck) 'Only if she like them.' She's not gonna like him. Punks. I got it. I got it. Our night is made. Listen, on Channel 6 at 5 a.m. "The Return of the Giant Squid.

'Give me a hit.' [woman on TV screaming] (man on TV) 'Imagine, only last week it was a little egg.' [dragon roaring] Oh! [moaning] [moaning continues] - 'Don't go down there.' - 'Someone has to.' (man on TV) 'It's our only chance to save the city.' 'This is disaster control. This is disaster control..' [laughing] '...in the direction of the downtown area.' 'We urge pedestrians not to try and leave the city' 'by the Causeway bridge..' You, uh, want to go in the bedroom? - Get it on? - Uh-uh. I'm not very hip, am I? Even when I'm stoned. Okay. Then I'll take a cold shower. 'We must not kill them we must preserve them for science.' 'To hell with science. Fly over and drop the bombs on 'em.' - 'What if I miss?' - 'Then dive into his mouth..'

Kyo, you sure you don't wanna go? No. Got to get Billy. He's next door. Hey, Christine, what are all these airline brochures here? Oh, I was thinking about becoming a stewardess. They've got so many silly rules. - Hm. - Hey, guess what? Marilyn and I are gonna go to real estate school. Yeah, they say there's lotta money in that, huh? You meet a lot of people. I like people. - Maybe I'll meet a nice guy. - Maybe I'll go. Oh, why didn't Mrs. Dain feed you? Now I've gotta do it. Hello, Billy, my little boyfriend. (Billy) Hi, Christine. Come on, goodnight sweetheart. Come on, Christine, let's go. Bye-bye, Kyo, Billy. - Mommy says you're a fag. - Well, so is Santa Claus. - You said fag. - Shh. Don't say that. What's the matter with this horse? You know, this horse has a beautiful ass. [indistinct chattering] - 'Where's Timmy?' - I don't wanna talk about it. How are things with you and Jay? Fine. We're great friends. When we see each other it's great. And when we don't see each other it's great too. Well, I envy you that. I always seem to get so deeply involved. It seems I can never just be friends with a man. [laughs] Oh, Buck! 'Race you to the top. Hurry, the sun will be up in an hour.' [indistinct chattering] [instrumental music] [horse neighing] [wind howling] (Jay) 'Do you believe in God, Chris?' 'Do you think we came from monkeys?' I don't really think about it. Boy, when you look out there there's just gotta be a God. [Jay scoffs] (Jay) One hell of a monkey. [all laughing] - 'Merry Christmas.' - 'Hey, Merry Christmas.'

And the doctor said if I smash my knee one more time I'll have to catch passes from a wheelchair. Hey, do you really work at The Mirage too? Yes, but I'm only just a poor showgirl. Nobody's opening a club for me. It's not exactly my honor either. I'm just sorta running the place. I bet it'll make loads of money. I'd be happy to make back what I lost in this town. You don't look like a gambler. I used to be eight years ago. No more. Ah, that's what they all say. I don't say anything unless I mean it.it. (female announcer) '...please report to 810 immediately.' Ha, great, isn't it, huh? It's somethin'. It's gonna be the hangout for the class crowd. You're the attraction, baby. Hi. Wendy said you were in here. - Hi. - Hey, sweetheart. (Tommy) 'Hi, Christine.' You always were fast in the old playing field. Ain't he great? Hey, come here. I gotta show you something. Wait till you see this. Look at that. Class, huh? (Jack) 'How 'bout that?' Oh, that's cute. Is it from a real game? Yes, it's just a touchdown I made one time. 'Just a touchdown?' With his bum knee he dragged three men across the goal line to win the championship. Everybody remembers that photograph. '"Just a touchdown." Huh!' - Let's have some lunch. - I've gotta get back. You go ahead, Jack. I'll stay and talk to the electrician. Is he something? 'He comes two weeks early to check the lights.' Nobody's comin' in here to look at the lights, baby. They wanna meet a six-times All-Pro football player. They wanna see those shoulders and those legs. Jack, don't do that. You make me feel like a piece of meat. What do you mean? What do you mean? I love ya. Gotta go. I'll see you later. My man. Well.. I just thought I'd see what was happening. I'll see you around. What about Wednesday night? - That's my night off. - I know. [soft music] Oh, don't look at me. Don't wanna be a showgirl the rest of my life, but it's fun. I like going out with Buck more than any other guy. I guess because it's safe. Gambling's okay, but I've played all the games. (Christine) 'Don't they ever get any new games?' 'I've tried tennis. Bought a whole beautiful outfit' 'and played once.' [thwacking] (Christine) 'Sure I know what I want out of life.' 'No, I don't.' 'Yes, I do. I don't know.' 'I'm happy.' 'Well, sometimes I'm sad.' 'But sometimes I'm just silly.' - Tommy, sometimes I envy you. - Why? I'll always have to be doing something. With me, it's sort of a disease. I guess it's because no matter what I'm doing and how much fun I'm having somewhere way back in my head I'm thinking somebody, somewhere else is having more fun than I am. That's awful, isn't it? (male #9) 'Hey, great opening, Tommy.' [indistinct chattering] - Sure Tommy will race you. - Hey, Jack? I go out and I hire two extra waiters I find out you hired two extra waiters. - What's the difference? - It makes a big difference. I wish you'd tell me because I gotta get a payroll out. Forget it. Here's your helmet. From the South Eastern Dairy Farmers. We just wanna get a quick picture. Put the helmet on for a picture. I-I'd rather not put the helmet on. I'll take the picture. You don't need the helmet. He doesn't need the helmet. - Vernon, get on his back. - No back, no back. - Now take the picture, fellas. - Yeah. You don't need the back. Owen, get the pail in the picture. 'Cause that's our business, right. Okay, now give that, give the mean look. 'Ha ha. That's it.' Okay, cheese. [laughs] Oh, you're alright. [indistinct chattering] - 'Back to the gambling.' - 'Let's get a drink.' You don't mind taking Kyo's baby, do you? No. Hey, you wanna go out tonight after the show? Well, I kind of have a date at midnight. 'Oh!' It's not really a date, but I promised this man from Atlanta I'd have a few drinks with him. We could meet later. Is three o'clock too late? Let's make it tomorrow night, huh? Tommy, we said we'd both keep dating. I know what we said. - Come on, man. Aah! - No, Uncle Tommy. Come on. Wanna play? Little water won't hurt you. 'Come on.' Not bad. Now I know why everyone's staring at us. They think we're married and Billy's our baby. [laughing] Darling, next time we have a baby let's try for Mexican. [carousel music] - You know, it's not that crazy. - What? You and I getting married. Having kids. Tommy. 'I know the reason you go out with all those guys.' It's so that you won't get involved with them, right? - That way you won't get hurt. - I'm not like that. Yes, I am. - Oh, I don't know. - 'Why don't you know?' Well, I hurt that guy I grew up with. And he hurt me. Everybody's been hurt. It always happens that one person loves the other one more. You can never get the balance right. Nothing's perfect, honey. The important thing is that I love you. I think I love you too, Tommy. But why spoil the whole thing by getting married? Why don't we just live together? Christine, I've been that route. I'm not looking for a chick to shack up with. I don't want a pad. I want a home. I think Billy's wet. Oh, let's leave it for a while. I want you to promise me something. I want you to sit down and think about it. For the first time in your life, I want you to make a decision. Not a whim, but a decision. Promise me that? Okay. (Tommy) 'Ooh whee! Ha ha ha.' Tommy? Wait. Oh, let's get married. I love you. I thought I told you to.. [laughs] Okay. [gospel music] You happy, honey? I told you I'd marry you. - Thank you. - Congratulations. I'm serious, Ted. A white girl, a negro, a Jap and a sissy. Come, let me straighten you up. Silk! Well, I hope you two are happy together. I love you, Tommy. No, thank you. I'd rather not wear a plastic flower. Well, do I get to kiss the groom? Oh, Buck. Would you like pictures? You can have two eight by tens for five dollars. Four five by sevens for four-fifty or you can have two wallet-size for a dollar thirty. We can make a recording of the ceremony for six-fifty. Rings. We've a large selection of new and used wedding rings. [creaking] Now when the music starts just walk down the aisle to Mr. Gray. ["The Wedding March" on gramophone] [record scratches] Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony. 'Which is the holiest state instituted by God' 'and blessed by his son, our Lord Jesus Christ.' [instrumental music] [music continues] [music continues] Hey, look. Hey, let's see what's on Channel 7, huh. [both laughing] (female #7) 'My kid had a sore throat.' 'Can't get support money from my husband..' I'll come and see you between shows, Tommy. Because I miss you. I'll get the groceries tomorrow. (female #8) 'Hey, Chris, come on.' I have to go, Tommy. I love you. Chris. (male announcer) 'Ready to light the fireworks.' Excuse me, please. I need him. I need him, huh. - Tom, come on. - Excuse me. It's important. It's important. Here he is in the flesh, Rosy. Tommy Marcott. - 'This is Roosevelt Dekker.' - How are you, Mr. Dekker? His charming bride, Mrs. Dekker. (Tommy) 'Hello .' Rosy owns Dekker Construction. He build half of Pennsylvania.. Nice to meet you, kid. I've seen you play, sit down. Aaron, make a phone call. - Yes, right away. - Come on, Tommy. Sit down. Sit down. Talk, talk. Here. Give me one of them sugars. I'll give you the roof of my house. I like them young. Ah, she's a little doll. [gurgling] I don't like that noise, Ann Marie. I like the way it makes bubbles in my throat. Play with the sugar, Ann Marie. (woman on microphone) 'Call for Mr. Clark Johnson, Mr. Johnson..' Excuse me a minute, I see someone I've to talk to. - Hi, baby. - Hi. He likes the white stuff, huh? That's his wife. Nice girl, she's in the show. I got a show up in my room she can be in. [laughing] I introduced them. Because I always sample the merchandise before I pass them. Okay, I gotta go and do my act. After all, that's what I'm getting paid for. (woman on microphone) 'Paging Ms. Renee. Ms. G.G. Renee, please.' Hey, tell me about that board game. It was fixed wasn't it, huh? (woman on microphone) 'Page for any one of the Diablo Brothers.' 'Diablo Brothers, please.' Hello, Mrs. Marcott. Do I know you? I'm Aaron, Mr. Dekker's secretary. Mr. Dekker wanted me to speak to you. He's concerned about the way the hotel is treating your husband. - He knows Tommy? - 'They met.' Oh. You see, he feels that, uh your husband hadn't really been given a chance to run the End Zone Room. - 'He can help Tom.' - Why don't you speak to Tommy? Well, he, uh, he thought he'd speak to you first. 'Uh, he'd like you to have dinner with him.' I'm married. Mr. Dekker's done many wonderful things for people. He can help your husband. I'll communicate that answer to Mr. Dekker. Now, look, honey. What do you want me to do? I want you give Tommy a chance. You promised him a real job. Promised? Ah! Hey. I want bigger letters on nude. Nude's got to be the biggest word. The rest you can write up there with a pencil. Now, look, I can be honest with you right? Tommy has one real function. He is vice president, in charge of smiling and shaking hands. He can do more than that. He wants to be involved with the business. I got a million guys who can do business. Only your husband is special at shaking hands. You're a bastard. Comes with territory. Now, make it blink. [gurgling] (Roosevelt) I don't like that noise, Ann Marie. [doorbell buzzing] Good evening. Mr. Dekker is very pleased you decided to accept his dinner invitation. Hello. Hi. Hi, make yourself comfortable. You, goodbye. We got some business to discuss. Aaron will take you to dinner, then afterwards you can play in the gift shop. Buy yourself some souvenirs. - Bye. - Bye. Hey, not over there. Right over here. Huh? Look. I'm gonna serve you myself. I let the waiter go. I don't like crowds. [chuckles] Hey! Best way to start a meal is with a little wine. Ah! And a kiss. I like to save the sweet things for dessert. [laughs] For dessert. Save the sweet things for dessert. That's cute. I gave up smoking too. It's bad for the heart. I try to keep my shape. It's one of the reasons I married Ann Marie. Well, seventeen year olds can give you a pretty good work out. She looks like a nice girl. Where did you meet her? I picked her up in a playground in Pennsylvania. Three senators and a governor where I went. I've never been to Pennsylvania. I built most of it. Dekker construction, that's me. I started out with six men and one cement truck. I wheeled and dealed. 'Busted a few competitors heads.' 'All of a sudden, I was the biggest.' [burps] Well, that's the food. I wanna get something out of the bedroom. - Come on. - I think I'll stay here. I'll put on some music. (Roosevelt) 'Hey, come on in. I got something to show you.' I can't hear the music in there. 'Come in, I'll hum it to you.' You can hum in here. Hey. Ha ha. Not a bad built for an old man, huh? Come on in the bedroom. [music on radio] Mr. Dekker, I really enjoy talking to you. Can't we just be friends? I got a million friends. What you stalling around for? I like you. What you want? A bracelet? Earrings? - Cash? - I don't want anything. I don't think we should spoil a nice evening. Ain't gonna spoil it, come on in the bedroom. No! I have to go. I'm sorry. Alright. What the hell. You don't wanna do it. You don't wanna do it. Thank you, Mr. Dekker. Ah! Nobody likes a tease, honey. Ah! I'm as good as any nigger. [dog barking] - Chris, where are you? - 'I'm in here.' Oh. Hey, you got in late last night, honey. Heard you when you came in, babe. 'I didn't wanna wake you. I was out with Wendy and the kids.' 'It was a birthday party. I think I told you.' Oh, yeah. I remember. Hey, I'm gonna take a swim. You want to go? 'Why don't you go right ahead.' Hey, come on, Chris. I don't wanna go alone. - Chris, are you alright? - 'Uh-huh.' Why is the door locked? Look, Chris, will you open the door? Now, come on open the door. If you don't open the door. I'm gonna break it down! (Roosevelt) 'Hey, nice, huh?' I like my initials on everything I own. Makes me feel secure. Aaron. Now, stand back, Aaron. Father, if I par this hole I'll buy you a cathedral. 'Go right ahead, Mr. Dekker.' Take the putter out of your mouth, Ann Marie. [sprinklers whirring] Uh, Aaron, I, uh.. I don't wanna talk to that guy. He-he's a trouble-maker, father. I don't wanna see him. Aaron. Wait a minute, Tommy! You keep away from me. Goddamn you. - I'm gonna kick your.. - Stay away. You stay away from me. Do you hear.. Goddamn it! Son of a bitch. 'You black bastard.' [grunting] [intense music] Black bastard. (Roosevelt) It's your ass. [music continues] What are we gonna do in Los Angeles? I'm gonna find myself a job where I don't have to play the clown. And you're gonna be my wife. He's got friends and I'm sure he's gonna try and get even. Just let him try. Do you really believe I only went up there for you? Yes. [sizzling] - 'Hey, Chris?' - 'In the kitchen.' - Good morning. - Oh. Hey, what is this? Breakfast, eggs and bacon. - Mm-hm. I see. - Toast and orange juice. I'm gonna be the perfect house wife. It's really what I want, Tommy. Do you know something else? We gonna have a baby. - We are? - No, not now. Oh. When you've got a job and we're settled and everything. You've gotta plan for children. Baby, I got go find a job. Got to go find a job. Ah. [machine whirring] (Tommy) 'Just another phony phony offer.' They wanna make me vice president just to put my picture on the goddamn box of cereal. 'Maybe I should try that NBC thing.' 'I don't know.' 'Just not cut out to be a sports announcer.' (female #9) 'Hey, miss, you gonna leave your groceries there?' 'Miss?' (male #10) 'Stop right there.' 'Don't turn around.' 'Don't move.' Who are you? - I am the garage freak! - Oh, what are you.. - Surprise. - Hey, Christine, how are you? [indistinctive chattering] I'm sorry, I wasn't here to make supper. That's okay, I had eggs. Where were you? Some of the gang from Vegas were in town. Vicky, Jay, Buck. I went out with them. I guess it doesn't matter. It's not too late anyway, huh. Well if it's not late, why are you wearing your robe? 'Cause I just took a shower.' Boy, there sure are a lot of jobs here for lathe operators. You know, I'm allowed a little fun once in a while. I haven't said anything of this. You don't really like my friends, do you? I used to date, Jay. You know? Look Chris, are you trying to start a fight? [telephone ringing] Yeah, maybe I am. Anything to liven things up around here. Hello? 'Hey, how you doing?' (Tom) 'Oh, it's beautiful hearing from you, babe.' 'Oh, really? Where were you? Europe or somewhere?' 'Oh man, that's great. Hey, when can I see you?' 'I'll be available tomorrow. What about tomorrow?' 'Alright.' 'Hey, I'd love that.' 'Tell the family hello from me.' [indistinct chattering] [chattering continues] Hey baby, do you know who that was? - That was Marion Walters. - Who is Marion Walters? Marion Walters, was the greatest flanking back that ever played the game. 'They called him moving Marion, The black breeze.' Now, he owns a big textile plant. 'And tomorrow, I'm sure that he is going to offer' me a big fat job. We are gonna move from here and get us a big house. We are gonna have kids and everything is gonna be alright. Not gonna be alright. I just can't make it. - What do you mean you can't-- - Oh I can't. I.. The lousy housewife. I can't make this domestic scene. You sound just like those Vegas kids. - You're above that now. - Oh, it's not the Vegas kids. It's me. I love you, Tommy. I really love you. But.. I thought, If-if.. I loved you enough, everything would work out. - Something's wrong with me. - There's nothing wrong-- There's something wrong with me. There's nothing wrong with you. The only thing that's wrong is that you under rate yourself. You can make it. I'll help you make it, baby. I'll help you, make it. Thing's gonna be alright. Everything's gonna be alright. Come on. Come on, Tommy. Hey man, what are we doing here? I thought we're gonna talk, man. Yeah, we are gonna talk. Moving Marion, keeps moving. You know I hate talking to friends in my office. Thought we'd come out and shoot a few. One on one. You still look pretty good for an old man, you know? Black and beautiful, baby. I had to get dressed for this. [instrumental music] [music continues] Hey, Tommy, you're always going to work. Let's go to track. No, I think I'll stay around, shoot a few more. I'll walk on home. Besides, I gave up gambling. Boy, you are a dull bastard. Ha ha ha. Lose that ball I'm gonna take it outta your first week's salary. - I'll see you Monday, man. - Right. 'You know, Tommy.' I really wanted a little great Porsche. But I bought this thing, cause it bugs my white sales manager. (Tom) 'Moving Marion.' [gun shots] [dramatic music] [music continues] Pick 'em up. - What? - 'Pick them up.' Madam, we are returning from a funeral-- I don't give a damn what you think. Pick them up or I'm gonna jump out. [tires screeching] Come on. 'Come on, get in.' Come on. Put the window up. - Thanks for the-- - Are you holding? uh? Do you have any shit? Any pot? Hash? - Downers, anything. - Well, I.. Lady are you sure you want that kinda stuff now? Yes, please. - We'll go my place. - Your place? What do you think, Douglas? I don't know. I've never turned down a widow before. Maybe it's a set up for a bust. Oh no, man. Even the cops aren't this sneaky. [Christine sobbing] 'Okay, lady.' (Christine) 'Drive.' [instrumental music] [music continues] (male #11) 'We didn't know who to call. We found your number in her purse.' She dropped two caps of muscone on top of a handful of rugs. - We tried to stop her. - 'She got crazy.' Ran up on the roof, took us half the night to get her down. She's coming down now. [laughing] Get away from her. Come on, God damn it. Both of you, get out here. You see what I mean. You try to be nice and they yell at you. It's the hair and the clothes. Come on, man. Let's get outta here. [music continues] Oh, baby. You'll be okay. Chris. The worst part is I can't even grieve at Tommy. Come on, Christine. Buck, I was leaving him. When the police came...told me. I was almost relieved. I mean I wouldn't have to be the one to hurt him. All this stupid crying. If only I knew it was for Tommy and not for me. I would, I wouldn't feel like such a lousy hypocrite. Don't start that, huh? Okay. What's new in the papers? Well. They're still holding that one guy. But there is no mention of Rosy. - You know, he hired the man. - 'Yup.' But you're just gonna have to forget it. 'I don't think they are ever gonna touch Rosy Dekker.' Oh, it makes me sick. Everyone just wasted decent period of time. Let it all blow over. Isn't that right? 'Christine?' Why go back to Vegas? I don't think I will. I was thinking about... going back to school. Why don't you? Maybe, I can learn something, a profession. (woman on speaker) 'Attention please, passengers for the Dunes Hotel.' 'The courtesy car is waiting at the front of the airport.' 'Paging, Ms. Jump, Ms. Valerie Jump, please.' 'Ms. Cindy Peterson, pick up the house phone please.' Sharon Gillman and Renel Halin, report on Monday. We have the rest of your names and when we have a place again. We'll call you. Thank you. Chris, I wanted you to know it wasn't me. Have you tried the River of the Tropicana? [no audio] Okay, thanks anyway. 'Hey, don't run off.' Now, look. If I can help you in some other way. Wait, let me get my tin cup. Well, you still got a mouth. What's the matter, I am just trying to be nice. - It doesn't become you. - Yeah, yeah. Jack Benton, bastard. I hear that so often it's like my full name. Jack Bastard Benton. You wanna know the truth. 'I feel terrible about what happened with Tommy.' I mean it wasn't my fault. Anyway I feel terrible about it. I can feel sorry for you whether you want me to or not. Oh. Jack, I am sorry I snapped at you. It's this town. 'Vegas is here because people like it.' They want it to be here. We are here because we wanna be here. Why don't you go home? Be a secretary for 100 a week! Till I meet a nice husband. Have three kids, a house, a dog, an electric tooth brush. I don't want my life to be a cliché. What the hell is it now? Small town girl comes to big town. Runs around, gets in trouble. It isn't exactly the story of Madame Curie. I just wanna be someone special. Goodbye. Christine...can I tell you something? Honestly. You're not that talented. You're no genius. You just got a pretty face and a nice chest. You're an average girl, why are you knocking yourself out? Why? Why not? [indistinct chattering] [chattering continues] [Shawn and David singing "La de da"] * Pretty things Shiny rings * * I am looking up and down the golden swings * * Circus strings Limousines * * La de da da daa * Masquerades toy balloons * * Sleeping away past sunny afternoons * * Racing cars Movie stars * * La de da da daa * Round and round Having fun * * No time to fall in love with anyone * * Lucky me Being free * * La de da La de da * * La [indistinct chattering] Christine, I...really wish you think it over. I've grown very fond of you on my trips here. 'I would like to see you more often.' 'Will you think about it?' Yes I will, but don't feel bad if I don't come. I've got a lotta bad memories in Los Angeles. Perhaps I can.. ...give you some happy one's. - Oh, I love it here, Rich. - You like the apartment? It's beautiful. I really think I am gonna do good in L.A. this time. I am goin' to go to those acting classes I told you about. - 'Ah, are you a little cold?' - Not really, no. What a pity. I wish you were. Why? Well, because I just happen to have a perfect answer for anybody who might be a little bit chilly. That's fantastic. Oh, you really spoil me. Coats, jewellery, an apartment. I feel like a queen. Oh, Christine, dear, dear. You'll break something. Oh, you are always kidding. - You're in great shape. - No, not now, seriously. Sit down, listen. There are certain rules that you must learn to observe when you are having a-a relationship with a older man. For instance, you must never sneak up back of me and blow in my ears, you might short circuit my hearing aid. And never in any circumstance squeeze my hand too tight you might...just cut off the circulation. Christine, I...have reached that realistic age when I must choose between fun and a heart attack. Ah, I'll hug and kiss you whenever I want. Am I gonna see much of you this week? Hard to say. I have a meeting in New York on Friday. Saturday, home. 'Well, whatever. Whenever you come back, I'll be here.' Do you know, I am a Scorpio and you're a Pisces. We're both water signs and we both have our moon in Taurus. I think what I've always needed was a mature man. 'Someone with whom I could have a meaningful relationship.' Oh, Jay, I'm so glad you're in L.A. Rich is really sweet to me, but I never see him. I have stay in that goddamn apartment to sing Casey Coles. Makes me feel like I'm in prison. Sounds like a drag. Do you remember talking about owning a ranch with horses and everything? Yeah. I still talk. I've been thinking a lot about it lately. I think it will be great to live on a ranch. The quite would drive you crazy, you'd be sitting around waiting for a rooster to crow. - No, I wouldn't, I've changed. - 'Oh, sure you have.' I really think I could make it on a ranch. How much would it cost to buy a few acres? I'm still trying to figure out how to pay rent on this place. Why did you leave the Ice Pack? I didn't leave. Manny fired me. Was my fault, I screwed up too many times. I've got some money. Richard's very good to me. - I can lend you some. - No. Really. I'm not kidding, Jay, really I just spend it all on clothes and presents for people. Silly little things to keep me happy. I could save a lot of money if I-I had a reason. Jay, why don't we buy a ranch together? We could get out of here. - I am sure we'll be happ-- - Wait a minute. What do you need me for? I just got done telling you I'm broke. Dammit, you're stupid. I've told you, Jay, I-I need someone. I'm lonely, Jay. I wanna be in love. [instrumental music] Richard keeps you and you keep me. - Well, I didn't say-- - Hey. I like it. Oh, that was such fun, Richard. - See you later, Mr. Sherman. - Thank you, Jimmy. Plane's always been just a convenience and a tax write-off. You are what makes it special. There' a long distance phone call for you in the office, Mr. Sherman. I'll meet at the car. Must be really something to be able to fly. Oh, shoot, it ain't hard. I can fly everything on this airfield. Can you really? I thought you just serviced the planes. Oh, hell, no. I do a little crop dustin' and sky ridin' and.. A lot of things, I ain't just a mechanic. I didn't mean that. Is it hard to learn? - What? - Flyin'. Well, not for you. Bet you'd learn pretty quick. Is it expensive? - What? - Lessons. Oh, no, I mean, you are a pretty gal, we'll probably work out somethin' where it wouldn't cost nothing. Mr. Sherman would love that. - What? - Saving money on my lessons. He'd be so glad to hear that. Well, I am not sure if.. Oh, maybe it would work out.. You mean, tell Mr. Sherman? I-I think I gotta go fix a plane. I'll, uh, I-I'll see you, I'll see you. I-I wouldn't, uh, mention, uh.. [instrumental music] [music continues] Christine...I'm back. [instrumental music] - Chris-- - Hello, Richard. - Did you win? - Of course, I won. Whoever heard of a rich man loosing in tennis? Your secretary called with some messages. What does she think about me? I pay my secretary a very handsome salary to think of nothing except of work. Call Mr. Pollock. He wants a decision on the presentation. Mr. Rosen Sandiego says it's very urgent to get in touch with him and your wife called. Christine...today I came to a very important high level decision. I'd like to marry you. [music continues] I'd like to marry you. I'm serious. 'My family is all grown up now.' I'm certainly not gonna bore with that old story about my wife not understanding me after 32 years of Stella and I understand each other only too well. We are just not that interested. Richard, everything's been fine up till now. I want to show you off and take you places.. ...as my wife. Oh, I know it might sound silly and childish and.. To borrow a phrase from you, why not? I'd propose on both knees, but I'm afraid I'd never get up. Now...I'm gonna have a drink. A shower. And a nap. You, uh.. You say the date. [music continues] You must be out of your goddamn mind! - Richard asked me to marry him. - So what? You could have stalled him for a while. I want you to go right back there and tell him.. Tell him you were shoppin', tell him anythin'. Jay, I left him a note. - God! - Oh, wait a minute! We've got some money saved. Bullshit, we don't have enough to pay for the mailbox. Look, I'll forget about the ranch. We're not even close, we were just startin' to get rollin'. Maybe we can meet someone else. Oh, sure, I am very big with millionaires, they're always sayin', "Why don't we invite Jay over some time?" [sighs] Look, do you really love me or do you just think you do? Oh, I do. Alright, then there's only one way we are gonna make that ranch happen. By getting cash, by me introducing you to guys who are not millionaires but guys that I know. Well, if they are nice guys, I guess I could meet them. They don't wanna meet you, they wanna give you fifty bucks and split! Wasn't much of a musician but I'd be a great pimp! Surprised? Prince charming turns out to be the wicked witch. Why, you bitch! You did this to me! I didn't have any dreams. You made me think something could happen. But with you nothing ever happens! Everything you've ever done ended up in the sewer! - That's where your ranch is! - At least I've tried. Then why don't you try the only thing you are good at, balling! Ah. [door opens] (Christine) 'Jay.'

Now? I don't think I can. You want a lesson? No, no lesson. Just take me up. I don't where I can find a plane. Elroy, take me up. And when we come down we'll have some fun. Okay? No foolin'? You ain't kiddin' me, now? Well, I-I'll find a plane. If I have to build one myself, c'mon. Look, there's a cute one. Hey, this one. No, no, that's Mr. Henderson's. He's mean. Hey, what about that one over there? C'mon, run now. You're gonna love this plane. I got the key for this'un. Hustle those little buns of yours. C'mon around this wing. Here she is. This is, Spirit of Indio. We use this little number for crop dustin' and sky riding. She flies real good. You ain't got nothing to worry about now. Hell, she can do anything a bird can except catch bugs. What's that? Wha.. I guess ain't nobody gonna catch us out here. Ha-ha. [instrumental music] Let's go. Get up in there. C'mon, girl. Hey, you know what I am gonna do for you? I'll write your name in the sky, to cheer you up. Bet nobody did that for you. Don't want anybody to write my name in the sky. I can do it real good. Well, I ain't that good at it. - Can you write anything? - Sure, I can try. I don't want you to write Christine. But there is something else. Oh, you mean, Howdy. Something cute like that? [drum roll] I can't write that. You're afraid, you can't do it, huh? Nobody dares Elroy Talmitch in his own plane. [band music] Can you spell it? Sure I can, it's the first word I ever learnt. [band music] Here we go. Okay. We're comin' now. Strap on your altimeters, hold on tight. [music continues] [music continues] (man on radio) 'Control tower to 41 Victor Papa, come in.' Woo-hoo! Control tower to 41 Victor Papa, come in. Please. Please! He isn't gonna make a K, is he? 'He is, he is gonna make a K! Give me radio, radio!' 'Talmitch! Now I mean it! Come on down here!' [music continues] 'Talmitch, answer your damn radio!' (male #12) 'What does that say, mommy?' Uh, it's the name of a new soft drink. [music continues] (man on radio) 'Answer that radio!' Talmitch. Oh, shit! [cheering] Talmitch, if you're not down in 60 seconds I have authorization to shoot you down. [music continues] [sirens wailing] (Elroy)' She did it, she made me do it.' She gave me one of 'em funny cigarettes. Not my fault. - Could you read it? - I didn't do it. I can't even spell that good. (Elroy) 'I'm sorry, I come from a broken home.' Yes, sir. Oh, right this.. Lovely car you got.. 'I've never been in trouble before.' (Christine) 'It was funny. It was really fun.' (Elroy) 'I-I'm a veteran now.' [indistinct chattering] Sorry, come on. Let it go. Now, why did you do it? Why not? [indistinct chattering] (Elroy) Don't hit me. Don't hit me. 'No police brutality now.' (Elroy) 'My sister-in-law knows Ronald Regan.' Not very well, but you know.
