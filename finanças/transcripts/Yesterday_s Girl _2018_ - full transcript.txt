What's happening? - It's, it's already happened. - We're being hunted. - Criminals are ya? - Right now there are some who believe anybody like us are criminals. - What Mia means is, anyone without the plague is being hunted down. - Plague? There's no plague around here except the flies. - I don't know what's gonna convince you. - Are you really from 1996? - Are you really from the 1950's? - Let's go find some answers. - Stay where you are. - Why are you doing this? - What do you expect?

Well they certainly helped us and now they're going to help you. - We could have done this on our own. - We would have been captured by now. - We met a man named Jude. He spoke of the rest of the world having wars, earthquakes. - Terrible storms, floods, devastation? - How did you hear about that? - From the radio. - Wait, you have a radio? - We use it of an evening. - Can we listen to it now? - Yes for sure but it's never good news. - This is an emergency radio broadcast. It's day 90 since the Yakatan Two asteroid impacted the Atlantic. To recap, our oceans are dying. East Coast U.S. has been araised with millions missing or dead. Britain no longer exists. Meanwhile, billions infected as rebel plague sweeps Europe. Asia faces mass starvation and plague. Africa has gone silent. Toxic red algae blooms are contamination fresh water supplies. War is being waged over remaining food stores. For those who can, conserve and ration water. Stay safe, stay alive. Amanda Knight, Emergency Radio Network. This broadcast will repeat every hour. - Time for Mia and Daniel to go back. - What have we done? - No, no, it's nothing like that. - Oh, Jack you're welcome to stay. - I'll stay with my friends, thanks. - We'd much rather you all stay, but when they came and told us where you were, they also told us when you'd need to leave. - They said to send only the two youngest visitors back. - And what of me? - Sorry Jack. Your daughter's on her way. You should stay with us. - Father, father. Father, father, father. Father. Father, remember me? - I remember. Yeah. - You know, after all that's happened, we're still alive so you should trust them too. - Jack, you have a daughter. Give her my love. I'm going to miss you. - We'll miss you. - Bye Daniel. - Bye. - Bye. - I remember. - Remember what? - The, the backpack. The campsite. The campsite. - Daniel, wait! Wait. Daniel, Daniel! - Dad, how long can we keep the kite up there for? - Forever, if I had my way. - Daniel, Daniel! Daniel, what's wrong? - I remember. I have a son. That was his pack back at the camp.

Enjoy. - Don't look at me you scum, move! - Please no, please no, please let me in. - Move! What are you looking at? Don't move! - Move. Move! General, we have something of interest for you. - Excellent! - No! No! No! - Come on, you have to do it. - I don't wanna do it. Don't make me do it. Please. I don't wanna do it. I don't want to do it. I don't want to do it. No, man. - You gotta. - What do we have here? You move without my permission and you're dead. I like a blue dress. - What are you gonna do with... - You know , in my previous life I thought that money bought power and fame. And then along came the plague, pestilence, cataclysm, and now I have more power and fame then I could ever have imagined. - But you're a clean skin like us. - Wrong! The plague, it's lethal for the weak, but there are some of us who are strong, immune, not like you. So here I stand rejoining in a, a new world order. Well the choice is simple for you. You join us or you die. But first you have to prove if you're strong or you're weak. Are you strong enough to join us? I like blue dresses. Are you a strong, are you strong? Who we gonna start with here, hm? Who we gonna start with? This blue dress, yeah. I like a blue dress. - No, stop. Stop! Stop! Take me instead. No! Take me instead. Stop! Stop! Leave her alone! Me instead. Look, look! - So noble. - Stop! Stop! - But useless. - Wait! - No! - I like blue dresses. But I should wait, you know? Because, women need to prove themselves in other ways, don't you think? And force is so less pleasurable than acceptance. I think I'll wait. - I want to share a secret. - So, so tell me. - You'll have to wait. - Come on. Is it important? - I don't know. Maybe. Maybe not. - Now I'm intrigued. So when? - Soon. - So, how soon? Are you an heiress? - No guessing. - Mia, I'll always wait for you. Always. - I can't even remember your face. - Mia? Mia? Mia. - I remember. Matt. I remember. Daniel? Daniel? Can you hear me? Daniel? Daniel? Listen. We're alone. Can you get up? - Yeah. - Do you think you can untie me? - Just give me five, yeah? Give me just a second. Come on. - Can you walk? - Where is everybody? - Look Daniel. - Mia, Mia. - Come on. - Just, just leave me. - Never. - You came. Hands up. - Behind you. - Hurry! They're catching up. Go! - This is beyond me. This is nightmares done this. - I, I just can't believe it. - We have to get back to the field, and I don't know how. We're lost. We're truly lost. - I found this in the car. It shows, shows the camp, and our collection point. It's a way back, to my son. Come on. - Nearly there. Not far now. We're here. - What now? - Dad! Dad! - Luke? Luke! Son. - They were right. - Mia! - Matt? Matt! Matt, it's you! Matt. This is wonderful. - I've missed you so much. - I thought I'd never see you again. - When I awoke, I didn't know where I was. I thought I'd lost you. - Stand your ground. - Jude? - How's the memory? - Getting better. Why are you pursuing us? - Because you need to make a choice, Mia. A choice for yourself and for your unborn child. - How do you know? - Let me help you. - Why should we accept? - Because today, a great many will die, including your son. - Why? - None of this is my doing. There is so much you don't understand, Mia. Let me show you. - Where are we? No. - It can't be. How? - I know this place. This place of all places. - The place of my last memory. Jude. - And mine. - Ours. - Remember now? - Everything. - Why? - They say returning to the scene of the crime helps reawaken memories. - What are you? - We, we are the future. - Daniel, Mia. - And with the setting of today's son, all the concepts and prejudices of the past will be dust. - Impressive trick. Return us now. - But Mia, we're here to see your future. - Murderer. - Mia, Mia. - Yet, all of you stand before me completely alive. How can that be? - Mia, Mia, Mia. - First, the waiting. ♪ For way too long ♪ ♪ Drops of rain fell bashfully ♪ ♪ No brilliance in my eyes ♪ ♪ You have forgotten me ♪ ♪ For way too long ♪ ♪ Heavens tumbled upon me ♪ ♪ For way too long ♪ - Forever, if I had my way. - Then he acts. - Matt! Matt! Matt! Matt! Matt! - And then the hiding of every last trace of you from the world. All in preparation for this day. - For what purpose? Did you think we would thank you? - No, but you will give thanks for the offer I'm about to make you. - There's nothing you can say or offer that would make me accept that choice. - Even for the life of your unborn child? Or for the life of Daniel's son? Look around, look around. Can't you see it? Can't you feel it? This whole forest, this whole world is dying. - What is happening? - Like you Mia, like all of you, it's dying. Alas, it's already begun. - No. - Yes. - I knew you'd be the strongest. - Remember. - Such waste. Alone at last. Now, my offer. Take my hand, accept my help. Take it Mia. You and your child will prosper by my side, while all around you will wither and perish in the oncoming storm. Take my hand Mia, it's that simple. Accept my offer. It's so easy to save your unborn child. All you have to do is take my hand, Mia. Take my hand. Alas, my offer is only for you and your unborn. Only for you and your unborn. - Mia, Mia, Mia, Mia, Mia, Mia, Mia, Mia? - Mia, Mia, Mia, Mia, Mia, Mia. Accept the offer, the offer, the offer, the offer, the offer, the offer. What say you? Time has run out. There is not escape. This is humanities last day on Earth. - No hope. - None. Soon, there will be a new world, where the concepts and hopes of the past are dust. Accept my offer. - You forget, I've died once already. Today I've seen the world devastation. Plague. Despair. Greed. Hatred. - You have to do it! - No. I don't want to do it. - Hunger for power, fame. - But there are some of us who are strong, immune. - And inhumanity to man. And death. So much death. But the light, it burns most brightly in the darkness. There's hope and love. And I refuse to believe that these concepts could be extinguished. - So what do you choose? - To hell with you. I'm Yesterday's Girl. Hope. - Take them. No, no! They're mine, you hear me? They are mine! Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine. - Come on. What?
