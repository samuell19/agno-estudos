(Whistles) (Bird calls) (Bird shrieks) - Hey. Hey, Humphrey. All right, let's get these dresses on. That's my little man. You want to go? All right, let's go. (Horn honking) (Chattering) - This right here is a peregrine falcon. It to the sky is basically what the shark is to the sea. Right now, it's circling its quarry, a pigeon. - Like in the park? - Like in the park. Okay, here it's going into its dive. It's what we call a stoop. A stoop is the fastest single action in nature, up to 250 miles an hour. That's about as fast as an indy car on the straightaway. - (Gasping) - Cool. - At the last second, the talons come out and it grabs the prey. It actually knocks the prey right out of the sky. (Chattering) - And that's how the falcon, being a predator, gets his food. - Hey, Humphrey, how you doin'? So did you miss me or what? Huh? Did you miss me? (Bird chirps) Is that a yes? I thought so. (Phone rings) - Hi, it's Rachel. Leave a brief message after the beep. - Hello, I know you're home, Rachel. Pick up the phone, okay? Pretend I'm your mother and you love me. I met this guy the other night. He thinks you have a personality disorder, a bird fetish. He thinks something happened to you when you were a kid. - Yeah, you happened to me, mom. - The reason I'm calling is I'm coming to the city this week. Don't get that worried look on your face. I'm not gonna stay with you. I just want to talk to you. - (Breaking glass) - Oh, shit. Shit, shit. You heard that, didn't you, hmm? You're thinking, she's drunk. She dropped her Martini glass. Well, you're right. (Door buzzer goes off) - I'm drunk and I dropped my drink. I can see you-- (tape rewinds) - Hello? - We'd like to speak with you, ma'am. - Who are you? - I'm agent hartz. This is agent halsel. If you could just open the door a little and we'll show you our identification. - Um, i--i don't understand. - Don't worry, miss sutherland, you're not in any trouble. We were just hoping you could help US in an investigative matter. - So, um, what's this about? - Uh, miss sutherland, from time to time in its effort to combat criminal activity, the bureau finds it necessary to set up surveillance centers to surreptitiously observe the actions of suspects. - That's quite a bird you have there. - And I don't want to alarm you, but there is a criminal suspect living in this vicinity. - Hey. - And what we'd like to do is set up a command post right here in the living room for a period of approximately one week, 10 days tops. - I don't think so. - There is compensation. We're authorized to provide a stipend of $200 a day for the privilege of using your premises. - Uh, we won't mess up anything. - What do you say, ma'am? - I'm sorry, I-I just don't think I'd be a good idea. Sorry. - If you change your mind within the next day or so, miss sutherland, please give US a call. Thanks for your time. - Why did you tell them no? - I don't want people going through my things, getting into my personal life. - And what personal life would that be? You know what your problem is? - I know what you think my problem is. - Unh-unh. It's not just that you never get laid. It's that you never take any chances. No, I know. I know you've had some bad luck with guys, but you've got to take a shot now and then, you know? You're all comfy in your little nest and along comes this incredible thing, you know, a way to put a jolt into your life or something. You don't even have to leave home and they pay you $2000 for the experience. You should pay them, Rachel. - I know. The money was tempting. I haven't gotten a raise in two years. - You won't do it. (Bird chirps) - What's he doing now? - Dining out. - Why do I get the feeling he eats better than I do? - 'Cause he probably does. (Laughs) - You're right. I gotta quit eating this crap. I gotta get healthy. Okay, I'm late. I'm, uh, temping at this accounting firm and they're very picky about being on time so I better go. - Well, then you must. - All right. I'll see you later. - Bye. (Whistles) Ah, that's my boy. That's my boy. What do you say, Humphrey? Are you up for a little company around the house? Hmm? (Bird chirps) - Now, this is all the room we'll require. - Hey, Humphrey. How you doin'? - We have our own cell phone. We bring our own food. We'll try not to be any trouble at all. - No smoking, no drinking, no profane language, nothing like that. - (Chuckles) Okay, good. - We work 12 hours shifts. Agent halsel here will take the night shift. I'm the day man. And please don't talk to anyone about this. And for your own protection, we're not allowed to discuss the nature of the investigation with you. Now, have you mentioned this to anyone, miss sutherland? - No. - Good, good. - Let's move these candles. (Sighs) (Bird chirps) - Shh. (Bird caws) - Your--your bird. What'd you say it was, a hawk? - A caracara from Central America. He was donated to the museum, but nobody quite knew what to do with him so i--i took him. - I don't think he likes me being here. - Yeah, he's very territorial. - So are they married? - I don't know. I'm not supposed to be talking about any of this. - Oh, come on. What do you mean you don't know? You didn't look for a wedding band? - Hartz is married. - Okay. Hartz is the straight guy and halsel is the shy guy, right? - Yes. - Okay, I'm coming over. - No, no. I'm not supposed to have visitors, okay? You know that. You're not supposed to know about any of this. - Well, why can't I just drop by unexpectedly? - Don't, don't. - Hey, Humphrey. (Bird chirps) - Hello? - Hello. - Who are you? - Oh, Dave mcmillan. I'm filling in for halsel for the next couple days. They said that you didn't allow smoking inside. - Okay. - Are you staying in tonight, Rachel? - Pardon me? - I noticed there's a Chinese restaurant on the corner. I was thinking of ordering out. Will you join me? - Sure. You don't seem like an FBI agent. - Well, we're a lot funkier than people think. Remember, we had a director who used to dress up in women's clothes. (Laughs) - So why'd you-- why'd you join the FBI? - To catch that bad guys. Why else? - I don't--i don't want to seem nosy, but-- - but you'd like to know about our operation. - Well, yeah. - I could tell you, Rachel, but then I'd have to kill you. (Chuckles) (Door buzzer) - Hi. - I'm gonna kill you. - Shh. Hi, I just, um, stopped by to borrow a-- a blender, but I can't stay long. - Okay. - Hello. Dave mcmillan. - Well, hello. Christy dyer, nice to meet you. - Pleasure. - Oh, is that telescope new, Rachel? I--i haven't seen that before. Is he the big guy or the little guy? - He's new. - He's fucking gorgeous. - Okay. Take this and get out of here. (Clears throat) - Hi, Humphrey. Well, if no one's gonna invite me to stay, I guess I should get going, but, um, you kids have fun. Rachel, oh, my god. Do you know what to do? - Bye. - Okay. - This is the Manhattan office of the federal bureau of investigation. If you know the last name of the person you are calling, please dial the first three letters. If you need further assistance-- - This is special agent David j. Mcmillan. I'm not in the office right now. Please leave your message and I'll return your call as soon as possible. (Beeps) - I never will understand this bird fixation of yours. They are nasty little scavengers, full of mites, oh, shitting everywhere. How are you, Rachel? - Hello, Cynthia. - That was a mistake, huh? Should've never had you call me that instead of mom. Kind of use it against me the way you say it, you know. - Why are you here? - I want to check into a clinic in Hartford. - We just went through this. You didn't show up, remember? - Yeah, i'm--I'm sorry about that, I really am. But I wasn't ready. And I just thought that if you-- if you could come with me this time and-- and maybe you could drive me and check me in. Maybe you could come Sunday night? - All right. I gotta get going back now, okay? - Me, too. Um, I'm going to the guggenheim, see if I can find a fifth husband. Give me a hug? You don't have to mean it. You're my big, beautiful girl. - Hey, little man. (Bird chirps) (Tapping) - Hi! - Hi. I hope you don't mind. I made myself at home. Do you like couscous? - Yeah. - You're very pretty. - So are you. - I take it you don't care for compliments. - You don't seem very concerned about your wise guy tonight. - Well, he's out of town till late. Just no action, nothing for me to do. So you're an ornithologist. - Yeah, I specialize in birds of prey, raptors. - Why raptors? - Because they're above it all. Soaring up there in the clouds, serene, in their own world, fearless. - Is that you, above the rabble? - It's the way I'd like to be, I guess. I admire them. - So your raptor. It's a predator. It must occasionally swoop down from the clouds and zap some helpless field mouse. - Only because it has to. You're not really with the FBI, are you? Now, why would you say that? - Your accent. It's, uh, it's not American. It's close, but there's something else in there. - Very good. (Chuckles) So who are you? - It was agreed that nickname would be attached to the bureau, the FBI. I can't say any more than that. - Are you trying to get me drunk? (Phone rings) - Would it work? - Hi, this is Rachel. Leave a brief message after the beep. (Beeps) Rachel, Rachel, pick up the phone, will you? Just give me a minute, okay? I thought that maybe I'd come by tomorrow and see you in your, uh, bird house up there. And, uh, maybe have lunch, something like that. - That's your mother? - Yes. - What's she like? - My mother? She's a drunk and a nympho. A real creature of the '60s, you know, into sex, drugs, rock and roll. She's been married four times, the last one died and left her a chicken farm in Connecticut. She thought it would be a good idea to let the chickens die so she could live there by herself and drink. I should get ready for bed. I've got to go in early tomorrow. Thank you for dinner. (Knocking) - You're more than pretty. (Bird caws) - It's Humphrey. I'm sorry. Stop. Sorry. I can't. - You don't have to explain. Goodnight, Rachel. - I want you to have this. I made it. It's a hobby of mine. - Very nice. I can't. - Look at that, perfect fit. - Thanks. - Be good, Humphrey. (Bird caws) - So I guess your advice is to sleep with him, huh? - No. My advice is to have raw steamy relentless sex with him. Lock the doors and do not come out for a week 'cause you need to get laid worse than any female I have ever known, including myself in grade 12. And I needed it really, really bad. Besides, he's with the FBI, for god's sakes. He probably uses double condoms. - I'll take it under advisement. - Yeah. - Bye. - Bye. - Oh, Rachel, you know, if you don't want him, give him to me, okay? Just tell him if he needs anything, a loan, a button sew on, a blow job, just tell him to call me. Bye. (Door unlocked) - Shit, shit. - Rachel, Rachel, you-- wrong apartment, sorry. - You must be Rachel's mother, yes? - Who are you? - Oh, just a friend of Rachel's. We're just setting up for a meeting tonight. - Hey. - Ma'am. - Bird stuff, bird guys? - That's right. This is in connection to here work in the museum. - She gave me these keys a while ago. She probably forgot by now. But, uh, I was headed back to Connecticut and I had to pee so it was on the way. - Yeah, go ahead. (Chuckles) - You are a very good looking man, did you know that? Really. - Thank you. - Do me a favor. Don't tell Rachel that I was here, okay? Promise? Hmm, yeah. She doesn't like me very much. You see, inside Rachel there's this teensy weensy bit of me buried and she can't stand it. She hates it. Uh, gotta pee. (Screams) - Shut up, shut up! - Don't fight US, it won't hurt. (Bird cries) - Give me your arms. Gag her. Gag her! - No, no. - Cuff her, cuff her. (Cries) - Got it? (Overlapping dialogue) - Grab her legs. - I got them right now. Let's go, let's go! - Okay. (Bird caws) - Shut up, you fucking bird. - So what do we do now? - We wait. (Sobs) - Did you wipe down the hall, Paul? - Yeah, everything except the kitchen. - No fingerprints anywhere. - No, none. Hey, don't worry. Nobody's gonna hurt you. - Joints jumping. - Pick up the things in the hallway. - No witnesses, Rachel. I can't leave any witnesses. (Gunshots) (Groans) - Tonight was the night? Pity. (Cheering) (Sirens wail) (Whimpering) (Bird caws) - Death always faces US alone, doesn't it, Rachel? (Grunting) - I'm sorry, Humphrey. (Groans) (Bird caws) - Rachel! Rachel! Rachel? - 911 emergency, operator, can I help you? (Screaming) - Oh, okay, I can hear you. Can you tell me where you are? (Glass breaks) - Don't hang up! We--we're tracing the call. Please keep making noises. (Screams) (Explosion) - Are you all right? Are you still there? (Shouts) (Chatter) - Ma'am, ma'am? (Shouts) (Sirens blare) (Sobbing) - We are with you. We know where you are. Ma'am, please keep making noises. Can I hear you? Emergency crews are on the way, ma'am. Please stay calm. Ma'am, please make a sound so I can hear you. - Good morning, miss sutherland. My name is Allan crancer. I'm acting under secretary of the state department. At the direction of the president, my office is heading up this emergency investigation, coordinating the efforts of all of the agencies represented in this room. Is there anything we can get you? Coffee, water? - No. - No? Fine. First off, let me say what a privilege it is to meet you. You demonstrated amazing courage. - People keep saying that. I was just trying to save my life. - The president himself wishes to express-- - the president? - You don't know, do you? You mean, no one at this table has told her? Young lady, you saved the life of the president of moracala. He's in the country to address the u.N. This fellow calling himself, what? - Mcmillan. - Mcmillan was trying to kill him at a reception, along with half his cabinet and dozens of v.I.P.S. You are a certifiable hero. And you provided US with an excellent description. Have we I.D.-Ed him? - Not yet. - Well, we will. (Clears throat) - Maybe we should give the lady a break. She's had a long night. - Uh, yes, of course. And you are? - Lieutenant Jack peligrino, n.Y.P.D. - Lieutenant peligrino supervises the city's v.I.P. Security detail. Of course, that may change after this. - What? - I said-- - you know, your people demanded rooftop responsibility. We were relegated to back up in the streets. - Thank you, gentlemen. Miss sutherland, on behalf of Americans everywhere, I want to express our profound gratitude and to thank you for coming in here this morning. - Do you have someone you can stay with? - Why can't I stay at my apartment? - Why, it's a crime scene. We've got s-- - sorry. - How about some parents? - My mother lives in Connecticut. - Okay. - I can't stay there. Um, I've a friend who will put me up if I can just go get some things first. - Sure. - So what happens now? - Well, we're not gonna catch this scumbag by sitting on our asses. Excuse me. I guess that's why they're not gonna ask me to handle p.R. For the investigation. (Siren chirps) - Oh, my god. - Hang in here. (Chatter) - Was mcmillan your lover? (Reporters chattering) - There you go. Detective? - Hey, Jack. - Hey, Tina. What you got? - Well, this appears to be the murder weapon. It's been fired four times. - You get any prints? - What do you keep in here? - A caracara. - You have a hawk? - I did have. (Sobs) - Want me to talk to her? (Sniffs) - I have a bird. Sulfur crested cockatoo. Ex mother-in-law gave it to US. I got to keep it in the divorce. Lucky me, huh? Ever heard of it? - They live a very long time. - A hundred years or more, they say. Know what creeps me out? This bird's gonna outlive me. He's gonna live with my daughter. It's probably gonna outlive our kids. (Laughs) She and I, we--we call it the energizer bird. Keeps going and going and going and going. - How old's your daughter? - She's, um, she's seven. Here. She's cute, huh? - She looks like you. - Yeah? Listen, uh, I'll take you over to your friend's house now. I think you'll be more comfortable over there. We have a man stationed outside for your protection, okay? - Thanks, lieutenant. - Jack. Call me Jack. - You think we can make a stop on the way? - Sure. (Whistles) - So this is all we have on mcmillan? - Yes, sir. - Its going on 24 hours. By nightfall, we'll have over 300 agents in the field making this officially one of the most extensive man hunts in American history. And so far, this country's best investigative minds have turned up zip. Does anyone have anything to add to that? Am I misstating our situation? - The president is still insisting on continuing his tour, sir. - Oh, yes. Thank you. I forgot that. - And now, I light of the moracalan president's decision to press on with his speaking engagements, security has been beefed up to extraordinary proportions for the remainder of-- - uh-uh, we've already seen that twice, haven't we? Why don't you, uh, why don't you go ahead to bed? - You don't have to babysit me, I'm okay. - No, you're not. You're not okay. You'd have to be crazy to be okay. You--you just had this guy-- - a guy I was falling for tried to kill me. Killed two people and was gonna kill 100 other people. And then he was gonna kill me. And you always said I was so choosy in men. - Hmm, you know what? You're not gonna like this, but I think you should go see your mother. - What's the point? She doesn't know anything about this. She doesn't watch TV. She doesn't talk to anybody and right now, she's probably plastered. So it looks like you're stuck with me. - Yeah, well, good. The way I look at it is you get a place to stay and I get my apartment cleaned for the first time in six weeks. Ha! - We move the money... Which doesn't impress me. - Yes, of course I understand. (Phone rings) - Yes. - Mr. Zander. Do you love me or do you love me not? - I have to take this call in privacy. If you'll excuse me. - Sure. - Sir. - Where are you? - Just tell me. Do you want me to go away or do you want me to finish the job? - We should meet. - Why? - I can't speak about it over the phone. - All right. - Oh! Oh, my god! Please, please don't kill me. - Why would I want to do that? I'm the one who fucked up. Do you want me to abort the mission or not? - Oh, we--uh, we would like you to continue. - Oops, sorry. (Chokes) - It's an unusual model. It's been customized. Where would you go to get a smart weapon? They're not exactly available off the rack. - Yeah, I know. - That's all for now. We'll deal with this later. What? - FBI found a print match in Rachel sutherland's apartment. - Cynthia Diane kirkman? - Rachel's mother. She was convicted in 1968 for possession of marijuana and two subsequent arrests in the '80s on dwi, both dismissed. - So? - The apartment was meticulously cleaned. The FBI found very few prints. Hers were recent, in the bathroom. Maybe she came by and met mcmillan. - We've been over this. Rachel told US who was there. According to her, her mother never came to visit. Don't waste any more time on this. (Dogs bark) (Groans) (Gasps) - Where's Rachel? - She's gone. She--she left. The, uh, the cops took her somewhere uh, they took her somewhere safe. I don't know. They wouldn't tell me. I don't know where she is. - Rachel: Hey Christy, it's me. I'm here at my mother's. The car made it fine. I'll call you tomorrow. Listen, if you need to reach me, I left the number on the fridge. Thanks. Thanks for everything. Bye. (Beeps) - I'll scream. - No, you won't. (Sirens wail) - What's up? - Rachel sutherland's friend. - Christy dyer. - She's dead. They found her in her apartment with a skewer through her head from ear to ear. - Where's Rachel? - There's no sign of her. - Find her! Get her on a.P.B., entire god damn eastern seaboard. Check her museum contacts. Her mother lives in Connecticut. I want a pair of uniforms and a car out there right away! - Jack! Jack, he hasn't left any witnesses yet. He took her out. Face it. - No, he fucking did not! That did not happen. He did not take her out. Move. - Mornin'. Like it? I bought the bird feeders the last time I was in town. Thought, uh, thought if I put some fake birds on them, that'd attract the real birds and that would attract you. It worked. (Laughs) Bird girl. I'm sorry about last night. I called the clinic. They can take me today. I'd like to go in this afternoon, Rachel? - Yeah. - I have this theory about you and me. You want to hear it? See, I told somebody last week that you have this little speck of me inside you. And you don't like it being there very much. It's always rubbing up against you and it produces friction. But isn't that what produces a Pearl, Rachel? Isn't it? I mean, a little bit of grit and some friction and, uh, something beautiful can happen. - If you say so. - See, I think if you could admit that there is something good in me, something worthwhile, then we could produce a Pearl together. - Maybe. We just can't seem to get past the friction part. - I know I always said I was sorry all these years, but I never did anything about it. I know that. This time, I'm gonna do something. Today. Wait here, okay? (Phone rings) - Hello, hello? Hello? - Hello. Uh, I'm sorry I startled you. I, uh, I got a flat tire out there. I was hoping that I could use your phone. What, what? Do I seem familiar? I have that effect on people. - Who are you? - You know, your daughter says you're a nymphomaniac? A drunk and a nympho. Is that true? - Oh, by the way, where-- where is Rachel? - She's not here. She drove to town. I want you out of my house. - I don't blame you. See, Rachel doesn't hate you, Cynthia. She fears you. She fears becoming you, ending up like you, a soused, lonely, old slag. - Fuck you! - Cynthia, have you been a good person or a bad person? In life, I mean. Because at this moment. - Mom? - If you're religious, this is a critical point. - Run! Run, Rachel, run! (Groans) - Mom! (Grunts) - No witnesses, Rachel. I can't have any witnesses. You know this. I'm the caracara, Rachel, and you're the helpless field mouse. It's no use, Rachel. The caracara always kills its prey. (Sirens approaching) (Gasps) - Help! Help, he's here. - Stop, stop right there! Don't come any closer! Hold on! - Let me go! Oh, mom. (Sobbing) - Call an ambulance. (Radio chatter) - We need an ambulance. - Don't move. - Get in the back. On the floor. Quick, move it. (Sirens wails) - And who might you be? - I'm the man who hired you and right now, I might be the one who fires you, unless, of course, you plan to complete our assignment. - Didn't Zander tell you? - Zander left the country. - Oh. Well, I plan to continue. Why not? - Well, you certainly have an odd way of going about it. Thanks to you, the president of moracala is now the most carefully guarded human being on the planet. - You have a new plan, don't you? - And don't worry about the girl. I'll take care of her. - Don't go anywhere near the girl. - Mom? Mom, it's me, Rachel. (Beeps) You're in the hospital. You're safe now. Can you hear me, mom? (Sobbing) Lieutenant peligrino, I just thought of something. You've got to protect Christy, too. She saw him. She-- no. No. (Sobbing) - Rachel, I'm sorry. But there was nothing we could do. - Oh, god. - I mean, he even took out the man we had guarding her apartment. I thought he'd gotten to you. - I wish he had. Mom, please wake up. Mom. Please, mom, I need you now. - Come along, dear. Take her out. (Sobbing) (Applause) - The moracalan president's remarks were warmly received by a packed general assembly. Tonight, he travels to city law university for his final u.S. Appearance and then the acclaimed leader returns home. His u.S. Visit, despite its bumping beginning, a triumphant success. - Maybe, maybe not. It's going to work. - Of course it's going to work, colonel. Why wouldn't it work? There's an assassination. You take out the assassin. You get a medal. And aman zimway is buried forever. - You worry too much about aman zimway. Who cares what happened in a couple of villages in Africa years ago? - Not a couple of villages, colonel, a tribe, a whole people nearly wiped out. - Look, it's mcmillan we've got to worry about. What if he decides not to go through with it? - Oh, he'll go through with it. I wasn't sure before, but I am now after seeing him in the flesh. (Chattering) - You talking to me that way? What's wrong with you? I'll tell you that right now. You better be here when I get back. - Dad dies, mom cries, baby fries. Dad dies, mom cries, baby fries. No kill, no thrill. No kill, no thrill. - Surely we could've arranged a better place than this, Allan. Men of our standing. So is everything on schedule for tonight? No problems. - Nothing we can't handle. - Why am I not instilled with confidence? - Strange, isn't it? We had all the confidence in the world in aman zimway. - Please. Africa is an open wound. Blood has flowed from it since the beginning of time. No one remembers the aman zimway massacre. It's a fleck of foam on a raging river. You and Mr. Zander supplied the arms. If you hadn't, someone else surely would have. Our mission went awry. No one wanted it to happen that way. Not you, not me. Shouldn't trouble your thoughts with it, Allan. It weakens you. - Zander's dead. I didn't think you'd mind. After tonight, all the loose ends will be cleared away. - I know you were reluctant to take part in this, Allan. I was forced to presume on our friendship. I hope you understand that. But I also hope that you will understand that this action had to occur and it had to occur now. With our president dead, all of this will end. There will be turmoil and confusion. It will be a time for a strong leader to step forward. - Like you. (Chuckles) - As my little boat rises in the water, so will yours. This must succeed, Allan. I hope you understand that. (Chatter) - Nothing here. You know, I don't get it. This guy wasn't even from moracala. Why are we going through his shit? - He had moracala connections. - So, what, now we gotta go through the shit of every asshole that's ever been to moracala? - Look, somebody killed this asshole, okay? Zander was your classic straight-up middle man, dipping his dick into sleazy activities all over the world. Middle of third world flare-up and he was there selling ak-47s to 12-year-olds. Oh, Jack's gonna love this. See anybody you know? - Zander. Crancer? - And it gets better, Jack. Crancer pulled a 12-year hitch at the CIA before moving over to state. Most of his time he spent in Africa. - Where does Zander fit in? - Couple of years back, Zander has a sticky problem with a somalian general. The problem disappears when the general suddenly turns up dead and the assassin vanishes into thin air after eliminating all the witnesses. - So crancer knew Zander who knew an international hit man. - It's a small world, huh? And there's more. I also found this. I was kind of hoping for some home porn, but... Come here. - In what can only be described as an orgy of killing and mutilation, it is the near annihilation of an entire people, the ancient African tribe of aman zimway. Even in the tortured history of moracala, there has never been a horror story to equal this. But who is responsible for this grisly genocide? Is it as some are suggesting, a depraved new level of terror in an escalating campaign of murder and mayhem sweeping this country? - Why am I watching this? - This official of the American government was among the first outsiders to arrive on the scene. - Let me assure you the United States government absolutely abhors this atrocity. We pledge all our power to assist the moracalan government in locating the perpetrators of this despicable act and bringing them to swift and resolute justice. - This is Jeremy ratsome. - That's it. - Aman zimway, moracala. - So crancer was there. The aman zimway massacre. Is that what this is about? - The president's final appearance is at city law university tonight. There's gonna be a small private reception beforehand. - Yeah, I know. I got an invitation. - From who? - I don't know. It just showed up here at the hospital. - Dr. Lawrence, dial 1-8-2, please. - Well, you're not gonna go. Mcmillan's gonna be all over that place. - I don't understand why they don't just cancel that appearance. - He insists on attending. - Are you gonna be there? - I wasn't invited. But I'm going anyways. - Then I'm coming with you. - Are you crazy? You're not going anywhere near that place. - Jack, I'm the only one who's ever seen him. I have to be there. - And give him another target? No way. - Listen to me. If he gets out again, he's gonna come after me and mom. He'll have to. - Dr. Cravitz, you have visitor in-- - besides, I have an invitation so if you won't take me, then, uh, I'll go on my own. (Radio chatter) - Name? - Colonel rawlins. - There you go, sir. - Thank you. (Grunts) - Anything wrong, sir? - Everything's fine. Everything's fine, officer. (Chattering) - So Zander was an arms dealer and he hired mcmillan. - On behalf of crancer, it looks like. - Well, why do they want the president of moracala killed? - We don't know that yet. We'll look at the other guy in Zander's photographs. His name's mkambati. He's a member of the moracala delegation. He'll be here tonight and I bet he can shed some light on why. - So you're sure crancer is part of this. - Yeah. Well, I'm pretty sure. - You're starting to sound like a conspiracy nut, Jack. (Chatter) - Good evening. - Welcome. - I gotta check on something for a second. I'll be right back. - Okay. I'll be fine. - Okay. - No, thank you. - Miss sutherland. - Yes. - How do you do? I'm Edmund mkambati, a member of the presidential delegation. We're so pleased you were able to join US this evening. - It's an honor to be here. - Oh, no. The honor's entirely ours. After all, you are the savior of our beloved president. He's anxious to convey his gratitude to you personally. Is there something you desire? - No, thank you. (Clears throat) - Can I ask you a question? - But of course. - What can you tell me about aman zimway? - Aman zimway, why would you ask that? - I was told you know everything about it. - And who told you that, may I ask? - Mcmillan. The assassin. (Siren chirps) (Beeps) - The president's arrived. Please wait here. I would advise you, madam, not to mention aman zimway to the president. It would be a mistake, an insult. It would awaken very painful memories. (Applause) (Explosion) (Screaming) - Follow me. Let's go, let's go, move! - Quick! Secure the area! - He's here. He's up here! Somebody help! - Stay close to our agents, Mr. President. We'll get you out of here. - N.y.p.d. The explosion was a diversion. Tell them not to use the security plan. - Doc, code red, agent down. Let's go! Secure the secondary route. We're using the secondary route. - N.y.p.d. Has found a problem with the security plans. - Disregard n.Y.P.D. Continue code red as planned. - Is the secondary route secure? Do you read? Is the secondary exit secure? - Exit clear. Secondary exit clear. (Gunshot) - Keep together, keep together! - Sorry, sir. - Fifteen seconds from secondary exit. We're almost there, sir. Keep it tight. - Dad dies, momma cries, baby fries. (Grunts) - We got a man down. - Cover. - He's been hit. Mkambati's been hit. - Get him down! - Stay with the president! - Everybody get down there! - Why? - We need backup. We need backup now. - Why? (Shouting) (Helicopter approaching) - I hate long goodbyes, don't you? - Police radio: 827 approach the foundation. - Put your hands up. - What? - Put your hands up. Put your hands up. I got her! She's part of it. - You have her? (Grunts) - Rachel! - Get back! (Arrow fires) - Ah! Ah! (Grunts) (Groans) - No kill, no thrill. (Gunfire) (Sirens wail) (Grunts) - Rachel, now I'm free like your raptors. Soaring the clouds. Come with me, Rachel. (Screams) (Gunfire) - Cover the back, people. Cover it! Need you down in south parking lot. Need backup. - Rachel. - Come on, rawlins, where the hell are you? (Phone rings) - Shit! No, no! (Speaking foreign language) (Laughs) - It's like I'm coming back to a place where I used to live a long, long time ago. It's a strange feeling. - You'll be okay. Your place, we cleaned it up a little bit. - Me and mom living together in the same apartment, this ought to be interesting. The doctors say it might be six weeks before she fully recovers. - You guys are gonna get along fine. (Bird caws) - Humphrey, hi! Hi. Where have you been? - Your building super called yesterday, said there was this really big bird on your balcony. Deena found a guy at the Bronx zoo, falconry expert, got him back in his cage. Said Humphrey's a little malnourished, but he's okay. - Malnourished, huh? We'll take care of that, won't we Humphrey? Yes, we will. Hi, come here. Come here. (Bird chirps) - But why did crancer kill mkambati here in New York? - 'Cause then it just looks like a botched attempt on the president. No need to look any further. He even asked mkambati to finance his own assassination. - You ready for a little snack, my man? Hmm? All right. Don't be long. (Bird caws) Help me out.
