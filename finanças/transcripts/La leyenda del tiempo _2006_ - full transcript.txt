THE LEGEND OF TIME This old world... which the white horse of day and the black horse of night... gallop through. You are the sad palace in which 100 princes dreamt of glory... in which 100 kings dreamt of love and wake up crying. WE WILL NEVER FORGET YOU, CAMAR?N Just a bit of bread, a bit of cool water... the shade of a tree and your eyes. There is no sultan happier than I... nor beggar who is poorer. The world is a grain of sand in space... the science of men, mere words. All cities, animals and flowers from the seven regions... are shadows cast by nothing. Give me the lover who moans with pleasure... and spare me the hypocrite who chants his prayer. At the end of last year, I decided to leave everything and go to Spain... to learn to sing like Camar?n, the best flamenco singer ever. After what had happened, I had to see what my life would've been like... if, instead being born in Tochigi, I had been born in San Fernando... on Camar?n's island. Take that, dude! Don't throw it so hard you bastard. - My hands are freezing. - You re such a pussy. Look, it's like snow, look! - Are you going to eat it? - Gross! Spit it out, or you'll catch an illness! - You haven't got the balls to eat it. - I ate it! - And what about you? - Of course I've got balls! Yuck! You haven't got balls to eat it. - Spit it out! - Look, look at his face! - Dude, doesn't this seem like snow? - You're flipping. - We're all bored. - Let's play the snow thing. Let's bury you Che?to. - Go on, lay down. - Good, Che?to. Let's throw salt in his mouth! Isra! That hurt, asshole! Throw it gently! THE VOICE OF ISRA Today's our last class of the year. Today we finish the semester. Christmas is getting closer... and the end of the year too. I would like for everyone... to close their eyes for a moment... and think about everything we've done... as if we were rewinding and could see all we did. The first day of class, lining up, meeting new school mates. So I want us to rewind a bit and remember everything. All the good and all the bad. What's happened since the 15th of September right up to today. Tell me about the best thing you've experienced this semester. - When I moved. - And you got a new room. A bigger house. Being here in school. And when my new cousin was born. Because of the presents, right? When I fell in love with my girlfriend but she says I'm cheating on her. - And the reason why you're happy? - That we're together. Cheating is just a minor thing? And now, I'd like you to go back again... and think about the worst thing that happened. As much in terms of yourself, here in school... in your family... or on a global level, what we've seen on TV, the newspapers... The first thing that comes to your mind. Don't think too much. Whatever comes up. Let's see, Jos? Antonio. What comes to your mind? M11. Yes, definitely one of the saddest moments... was the attack that happened on M11 in Madrid... in which 192 people died. - The Twin Towers attack. - This year! Oh, this year? Then, my brother being taken to the hospital. And you, Isra, the saddest moment of the year for you? - What happened with my dad. - What happened with your father. Why'd you shave all your hair off? Why when you were so good-looking? With all the hair you had. Now you have an egghead. But with long hair too. He's the same either way. You look so ugly now, I don't want to be seen with you. At what time are you meeting the blonde? - Tonight. - I'm going to steal her from you. Well, I won't take her, but only because I'm committed to Tamara. That's not true. You can't steal her... - No, but who's going to love you? - You're cruising for a bruising. Let's see who wins. By blows? Come on, let's have another match. Another match! - Hey there, behave yourselves. - He's the one! Like this. But no tricks. Wait, let me get a good grip. - Go! - Wait! Go! You cross-eyed freak! - Here with the boys learning? - Yes, here with the boys learning. I'm the only basket maker left on the island. - That runs in the blood, right? - You bet. So, what thoughts do you guys have about your future? - What have you thought? - Basket maker! Basket maker? Not for me. I'm going to work as a policeman... or else in construction. You know, as the boss. Policeman? Have you ever seen a gypsy cop? Ramon, have you? I have two cousins... the one's a sergeant... - ...and the other is a captain. - I didn't know that. - Better than the dole. - Right. - What about you? - Policeman or fireman. Loafing around won't get you anywhere. - You have to study a good career. - I'm studying. - Israel, don't you sing anymore? - No. I don't feel like singing anymore. Your granddad here told me that you sing really well. Right, Ramon? Sing just a little. - Just a little song for granddad. - I'm leaving off singing. - I don't like singing. - What a grandson, Ramon! Not even his granddad is getting him to sing! Right this minute I want to write a book for grown-ups... a book in the name of all children. I'd like to talk to injustice... and tell it that this life has no point without heart. If I could ask for only one miracle... I would pray for it to rain peace and love for many years. May it rain love, May it rain love. Rain, a rain of love All over the Earth. A rain of hope falling from a blue sky. May the whole world have rain. Rain, rain, rain... love, love, rain. This stuff is all fake, man. What if I went up there... and ripped their wigs off... make-up and all? Look, at the tree! He's about to fall over. If he falls he's going to break something. This costume is ludicrous! And I, who am one of the bad guys, wish to become good. I wish to become good, but you re the one who is scared. And I, who am one of the bad guys, wish to become good. I wish to become good, but you're the one who s scared. What are you afraid of? Of being given, without warning. Of being given, without warning a kick in the pants... Of being left picking up pieces of yourself. All the while, I never forget that we once were something more. Israel... Isra... Isra... What? What are you doing out there? Come in. Why should I come in? - You are bored. - Bored? You are bored without me! - Of course! - See? - I'm not bored. - Me either. Of course you are bored. Give me a break! Who are you waiting for? - Isra... - What? Who are you waiting for? Your dog? Don't start in. Who's going to pass by there? You should care about what I'm doing? - Yes? - Yes. - Because you're my little brother. - Oh, the little one! Who do you think's going to pass by, moron? What passes by here is my own fucking business! How are things going in your house, with your brother? - Horrible. - Horrible? Why? Because we're always fighting and saying stuff to each other. And what do you think the problem continues to be? I don't know, I tell him to behave and then he hits me. - What? He hits you? - Of course. And you don't... What do you want? For me to hit him? No, but do you give him cause to say things to you? I say to him, Isra, don't do that, or else, I'll hit you. Man, just like that? "I'll hit you"? He says, "I'm going to give it to you, you piece of trash". - And then we're fighting. - And then you, from that point... I go ahead and hit him good and we go at it. I think that you guys, besides other things... need to get straight that you're the older brother. That very often you stand in for your father. Many times you're the one in charge... - No one minds you? - Of course not. - I have to slap them. - That can't be. Things can't go on like that. - Hello. - Good day. - This knife. - The boy will bring it back to you. - Alright. - See you later. You always come here to smoke? Yeah, since my boyfriend doesn't let me... You're daft. Why don't you leave him? It's not just him, it's also my parents. Just come with somebody else. My parents don't know either that I hide here. So fucking far away? How's it going with your girlfriend? I'm going to send her to hell. I'm sick of her. We never go out. What's that about? That's no girlfriend. Just a friend with petting rights. When we finally go out, just wait and see what I've got in store for her. You're going to fall. Be careful. Come here and stand in front. - Are you going to come over here? - I'm coming. Watch it, you're going to fall. I bet you are going to fall. - Give me a cigarette. - A cigarette? Sit here, come on. And cup your hands around it. Cover it well, damn it. This lighter's completely out. Do it right. The lighter's run out. And you want tobacco? You smoke? - Of course. - And your parents know? I smoke behind their backs. Just like me. Or I wouldn't have to come out here. - Can you do smoke rings? - Smoke rings? Little circles like this. Just wait for the wind to die down and I'll do some. - It's just with this wind... - Go on, try it. No way, it doesn't work with this wind. - What about the train? - The train? You take a drag... and the one who's over there sucks in all the smoke. You have to swallow the smoke that the other person blows out. You have to come right up to her, and swallow the smoke. Blow it out. There you go. But it's a lot of wind. Alright! You never did that before? Smoke rings I knew but that bit about the train... What about hearts? You put your finger here. If rings don't come out, much less hearts. Yeah, much less... I'm dying to go out! Two weeks without going out! - Because of your grades? - Yeah. - What did you get? - A "C". - And you? - A "B". But you've repeated. I know... - Where are you going now? - I don't know. - To the square? - Maybe later. Here you go. The bells are sounding at the Puerta del Sol... and now the clock will strike twelve. Ringing in the New Year! Check. Turn the TV off! Happy New Year! - Are you afraid? - No. It just tickles a bit. See? That's the dragon's face. If he would've done that to you, you would've jumped. But Isra is a brave guy. - Are you brave or not? - Sure. Is that the first one you get? - No, the second one. - The second one? The first one was here, on the left arm. He still has to finish it. With a design of his choosing. He gave me one too, here. Show it to him. I did the name of his father who was a good friend of mine. His mother gave me permission and I did the name of his father. - It still needs to be finished. - We'll make it bigger. I'll do something to my liking... a small flower, something nice. Something that suits him. Because he's still little. Something that goes well with the motif of his father. But nothing too serious because he's a kid. But it must have hurt you much more than me. - Yea. - But he is a fisherman. His skin is rougher and tougher. He's always outside, with his arms out in the air. Always with seawater, salt water. So it's not like a child's skin. He doesn't have skin, it's more like shoe leather. Like a purse. - Are you going to do another one? - He should wait till he is older. - Careful, it cuts. - Good... Excellent. But I want to see... how it cuts. Give me your hand. - No! - Yes. Don't worry. Put your hand here. Spread out. And close your eyes. - No. - Close your eyes. Close, close, close... - Alright? - Alright. Very good. Close your eyes. Close them. Okay? Good... - Were you scared? - A little. But you are a man. Why do you have so much fear... - ...of the knife? - What's that on your neck? - Here? - Yes. What do you think? Was it with a knife? Knife? - No. - Fish? - What? - A fish? A fish? You're close. What kind of fish? - A swordfish. - Sword fish? A fish... that has something like a knife. Oh yes! When I was on the boat... I was looking into the sea... And suddenly... - Did it bleed a lot? - Yes. But... no! The truth? It was a woman. - A woman? - Yes. Very dangerous. Sometimes, lots of kisses. But after... Sometimes... - A wild woman? - Yeah. - You don't believe me? - I don't believe you. Have you seen how they catch tuna? Over there, you'll see how it is done. Do you want to take a look? This photo shows how they do it. - These are tuna. - Tuna. And lots of blood. That's where I work. - And do the sharks come? - Sometimes... - And what are these? - The other photos are of Mexico. Very old also. And look at this one... what's happening? - What are they doing? - They're shooting them. They are killing these people. - And they died. - Yes, before and after. - Is that your town? - No, a town in Mexico. And I like this photo. - Is that you? - No, this is way before. But... his face, it's very brave, right? And very peaceful. They are about to kill him... but him, really free. I want to die like that. Like that? Isra, watch out for the police! Do it nice or you'll make a sorry impression. Yeah, do it nice. Hurry up! He doesn't even know how to write! Isra, you're hopeless! The girl is mine! Don't do stupid things! So are we going to throw stones or what? Let's go. - What should we aim for? - The stick. I was closer than you. When you rehearse, why don't you sing? - When we rehearse? I sing. - You don't! Your voice breaks even when you talk. - I was singing! - Yeah, sure. Why don't you sing in the rehearsals? - See, I hit it. - I don't think so. We can't sing because we're in mourning. And why are you in mourning? Why are you in mourning? - Why? - Because... when we are in mourning we can't do anything. How so? Because it's the way we have... and we can't do anything, we can't go anywhere. - And when is the mourning over? - When she decides it. And when will your mother end her mourning? I don't know. When she wants to, she'll end it. Meanwhile there can't be weddings or anything. Gipsy weddings are so beautiful! Yeah, all this talk about weddings but you don't get any action... Look, to start with, I've been with Julia. I've also been with Big Tits Pati. We were together. - But you were pretending. - It was for real! You guys were just pretending. - A cute boy like me... - Give me a break! I'm worth a lot. And wait till I grow up. Yeah, that's what your mother tells you, right? - That's what I say, me, the MOI. - No wonder. When I'm grown you wait and see. Is that what you dreamt last night? That? No. I visited an expert fortune-teller. You don't know how to kiss, right? - We can try, if you want. - What? - What did you say? - I don't know. A kiss would be an honor for you. It'd be an honor for you! - I'm a real ladies' man. - I see. - And very cute. - Impressive. If I were to go with you, you'd have to wear taller shoes. I'm the same height as you. Even 5 centimeters taller. I'm tall enough to reach you down there. You're a fucking pig. You know what you need? Shall I tell you what you need? - What? - Two good slaps. - And what do you need? - I don't know. - A few slaps. - I don't think so. The ones I get, my mother gives me. And the boys, sometimes, for a good reason. - No way. - Yes. Maybe the girls do slap you. If a girl slaps me, she may have a good reason. - That's what I'm saying. - And a boy... - ...can easily slap you. - Only sissies slap girls. A good slap to teach her a lesson. If you'd hit me, I'd knock you out. - I wouldn't hit you. - You wouldn't dare. I would dare touch you, though, when we are all... You're still too young to have a girlfriend. No I'm not. Put your clothes on. Look at me. Alright. Put them on. - Shall I help you? - No. You know how to do it... you're a big boy, alright. You're a big boy, aren't you? I'll put your socks on. Wait! Stupid! Pig! Gently. You've got to treat your big brother gently. My little brother! Okay, so now you're both here. Now you need to talk about what you usually keep to yourselves. About your relationship. It seems that you are always contradicting each other. Then the threats start and it's all over. How many times have you sat down quietly... to talk about your differences in a calm manner? Never. Yes, once. You even disagree about that? You should both remember, right? What about Christmas eve? Are you an idiot? Israel, find something every day to congratulate your brother about. And vice versa. "I congratulate Israel because today he's behaved". Each of you should congratulate the other daily. And you'll see how good you're both going to feel inside. And the last fight? Why was that? - You should know. - You also know why. You began to throw stones at me. - I threw them lightly. - You gave me a lump on the head. You threw a stone at me. Yes. Cause you started it. You started to throw stones and I got mad. I lost it and threw one at you. It's your fault. My fault?! Why? Because you should say that you're sorry. - I'm sorry. - Speak up, I can't hear you. - Wash your ears out. - Speak louder. I can't hear you, and, besides I have to think about it. - Come on! - What? You're just a snot-nosed little kid. The bigger you get, the more of a shit you are. You say you're such a man, such a man! But you're a piece of shit. I see you fighting with somebody and I defend you. You treat me like shit. Whenever you want to brag in front of the rest... - ...you say, I'm not your brother. - That's a lie! - Come on! - Will you forgive me? Will you forgive me? You're such a funny guy... Give me your hand! It itches... Look at that beautiful seagull, kill it! Idiot, that's a partridge. You're going to fall! You scare me doing that. Imagine, you put your foot there and down you go. Don't worry, I know what I do. - It's scary! - He should've fallen in. - Yea, and you'll take care of me. - The hell I will. If you'd fall, you'd never climb up again. Israel has wanted to go with you for a very long time now, right? - Do you like my brother, Saray? - Not at all. - And what about him? - I wouldn't know. - You should know. - Only Isra knows. You're repeating yourself! You asked the same thing twice! You should've said: "Does Isra like you?" - Or "is he into you?". - Me like him, no way. - He likes you, though. - What nerve! Look you guys are winding me up. Leave me alone! Watch out. The dirt's going to fall! If I don't cut him short, this bore just goes on. And you there insisting... Are you listening? He told me... "I'm really handsome, if you want, I'll show you". I told him: "I don't go with guys who are shorter that me". - Well done. - Of course. You are not bugging us anymore? - Che?to... - No, please! Hang on, I'm slipping! Please, Che?to, let me go! - What a boy, such an herbivore. - Herbivore? - What a savage! - Herbivore?! Come here, come. You're a coward. Who was it?! I curse your mother! I curse your mother, Saray! Throw me that stone. I'll get you! Come on you coward! I'm going to fall... Come over here. What a coward. Girls are such cowards. She'll go when I go. Let's go, Saray. - I'm going to fall! - Come on, I won't fall. I'll stand in the middle... Don't step over there, it sinks. Step on the wood. Watch out. Okay... - Wash your hands. - Hold onto me. - Wash your hands. - That's what I'm going to do. Yuck, this water stinks! No! Him! Son of a bitch. You'll never get him. You go straight to hell. Stop it, Che?to! Here, sit down here. Good place. Look over there. That's where our boat came in... from Japan every year. This year it doesn't come. But the tuna come. Many. And why don't we both go to Japan by boat? - You want to go to Japan? - Yes. I'm going to stay here. Here there's a factory, right? I'm not going back. Will you live here forever, then? I don't know. At least for this year I'll stay here. Why don't you want to stay here? Because I want to leave Spain. Go outside of Spain... Where do you want to go? Japan or... Marbella. Marbella. Marbella, where is that? Far away. Marbella. And where else? - Over there, to Barcelona. - Barcelona is inside Spain! Barcelona is inside Spain. In Japan, there is good culture. - Good song. - No. But I don't want to work. - What? - I don't want to work. But a lot of money, right? Without working? A lot of money? Man! It's very difficult. I hope you get to visit many countries. But sometimes you have to stay in one place. Don't you look, don't you look. Focus on not moving, okay? Okay. It's done. So, you like it? This boat is the swing in your lap, the place... where I dream of your kiss, and your sweet embrace. Whisper something into my ear so that I can understand... what your waves are telling me, cause from you I long to hear. Tell me, bay, why the moon is the only one you let love you. why the moon is the only one you let love you. - Where are you coming from? - And what the hell do you care? - Don't mess with me. - I'm not messing with you. You know where I see you? In jail. And I see you begging in the street. What a jerk! Aren't you ashamed of yourself? When Dad was here, you didn't do this. So why do you do it now, idiot? What because you think it makes you more cool? Not so cool, boy. In front of your friends you get cocky. But as soon as you get here: "Don't spank me, Mum!" You're not ashamed to watch TV? Our mourning hasn't ended. And you're not ashamed to smoke 3 or 4 joints with your friends? When Dad was here you never did that. Because Dad used to hit you. And I'll do the same thing. So you're ashamed. You should be more ashamed than I. Remember when I hit you? I only had one father and you're not him. - But I'm your big brother. - So what? - You should respect me. - I should respect you? - You should respect me. - Little rat! - I'm not calling you names. - Shut up! If I decide to hit you, say your prayers. If I see you again smoking a joint, I'll make you swallow it. - Forget about me! - I'm your big brother! And what the hell do you want? Stop the bullshit, asshole! - What an idiot! - I'm sick of your crap! You're still looking at the picture? Is that for your tattoo? - And what do you care? - I don't care. I'm just asking. Are you gonna use it or not? - Are you jealous? - Me? Jealous of you? Yeah, that's what you'd like. - Where are you going to do it? - On my back. Why? And if I do it on the chest, all the better. Because I loved him a lot. On the chest, and way bigger. If you do it so big... it's just to show off, to brag. I'd rather do a tiny thing... than a big one. This is not meant to show off. You just want to have it to be able to show it off. I want to have it big on my chest so that he can see it. - And the money for that tattoo? - That's easy to get. You won't be able to stand it. You don't have any hair on your chest. And you just have four sorry little hairs. Shall we have a match? Like that. Wait. One, two, three... Cost you a bit, huh? Come here, Saray! - What? - Come! Look at that! What are you doing with this? That cuts like hell. Cool! - What's this? Chinese or Japanese? - Japanese. And what's it for? Cutting tuna. - This is for cutting others. - It's for cutting tuna. It's really cool. Come here, I'm going to show you something. - Put your hand here, spread out. - Here? I'll show you what that Japanese guy taught me. - Close you eyes. - I'm not closing them! - Trust me. - I'm not closing them. Close them. I won't harm you. Come on, trust me. - Close them. Okay? - No. Do what I say. Keep them closed. What an asshole! - You were you scared, right? - Scared shitless. That's how I reacted too. - Obviously, since you're smaller. - Now I'm taller than you. - You're out of your mind. - Shall we measure each other? I'll measure you first and then you measure me. - Go on. - Get into place. But no standing on tiptoe. No cheating. I'm not cheating. - Here. - You're putting it too low! - That's where your head is! - Go on. Let's see. Move. Look. That's your mark. - You lowered it! - I didn't. Now it's your turn. Let's see... Okay move. And that was mine. - Exactly the same. - No. Mine is here. You measured me way too low. Go back. You cheated. Close your eyes. Close your eyes. - Sing a little bit for me. - No. - Is mourning over? - For me, it is. Now that your voice has changed, it's a shame that you don't sing. - I don't feel like it. - You never feel like it, now? How am I supposed to feel like it? Would you sing, if you were in my shoes? Before that, I used to sing whenever I was asked to. But how should I sing now? - How long since it happened? - A year and a few months. - What? - A year and a few months. What a drag. And in a year and a few months, as you say... you suffer a lot. Was it tougher at the beginning, and slowly you started to forget? That's not something you just forget, Saray. It's something you remember your whole life. Are you still having a tough time? THE VOICE OF MAKIKO It's so hard for things to happen for the very first time... that, when they finally do... it's almost impossible to keep them from happening again. As far as I know... nothing in the world has happened only once. I'm sure that this has happened millions of times before... and that it will happen again another million times more. When I decided to leave, I worked as a nurse in Tochigi... and I was well used to dealing with terminally ill patients. We nurses are trained to deal with the deaths of others... but not with our own pain, nor with the pain of those we love. For some time, I'd wanted to change my life, head to the south of Spain... and learn to sing like Camar?n, the best flamenco singer of all time. So I left my house, my job at the hospital... and bought a plane ticket. A ticket out of Japan, a chance to start a new life. I recognized the landscape at once: it was the same as in the songs. This old world... which the white horse of day and the black horse of night... gallop through. You are the sad palace in which 100 princes dreamt of glory... You are the sad palace in which 100 princes dreamt of glory... in which 100 kings dreamt of love and wake up crying. It had already been thirteen years since Camar?n had died... but as soon as I arrived in San Fernando... I began to find traces of him everywhere. He was so special that some believed he was a saint... and mothers would take their sick children to him... so he would lay his hands on them and heal them. Great, Taka. That's good. That was really good. See you tomorrow, alright? Tomorrow. Good bye. Lift the arms a bit there. Go ahead and rehearse a bit now, okay? - Oh hello. - So pleased to meet you. - Me too. What's your name? - Makiko. I'm Ana Maria. Do you want to dance? In Japan... I danced a little. - But now, I want to sing. - To sing? That's hard. I only sing a little. But I can't teach. Maybe in the flamenco association. You go and see and listen a little... and see if you can learn. Because the cante can't be learned. You have to listen to it and little by little... But in the association you can hear a lot of cante. It's not easy but you can hear it. - Not here? - No, not here. Hi. You're one of the girls who were dancing, right? - Yes. - Have you been here long? Yes, pretty long... what about you? Did you just arrive in Spain? Yes, this month. I still don't know how things work here... Well, if there's anything you need to know, you can ask me. I'm looking for someone who could give me cante lessons. I've been to a lot of places, but I haven't found anyone to teach me. Do you know of anywhere they give lessons in cante? There isn't any place here where they teach cante. You have to ask around in the bars and in the social clubs. That's the only way. Another thing... What sort of work do Japanese girls do here? Work...? Yes, I was wondering if you know of any jobs. A lot of the girls here work in the Chinese restaurant. - Shall I give you the address? - Yes, please. - Right here, please. - Okay. Do you think I'll be able to work? I don't know anything about Chinese cuisine. - Do you speak Spanish? - Very little. No problem. Here, Japanese work in the Chinese restaurant... and Argentineans in the Mexican restaurant. It's all the same here. - Thank you. - It's called Hong Kong 2. Go there. - Thank you. - I have to go now. - Lots of luck. - Thanks a lot, really. I want to sing flamenco. In Japan I can't learn. And you want to learn? - And you want to learn here? - Not yet... I am still looking for a teacher. But don't you sing, right? - No. - You want to learn. Do you have any idea about singing? No? We'll have to teach you. That has to come from the inside. - I don't know... - To learn cante... - ...how long? - How much time? If you're smart... it can take... It can take 2 or 3 months, give it 3 or 4. To really get it. But Japanese girls are smart. The important thing is to learn the themes. You keep reading them, and you learn them fast. At least 2 or 3 months. Give it 3 or 4 months. Are you singing now? Now, I'm not. Not since my brother died. I'm staying here half retired. When they call me, I sometimes go. But before it was every day. 30 years with him. Singing to dance. In Madrid, with my brother. Madrid, Sevilla, Barcelona... - Who is your brother? - Camar?n. - Camar?n? - Yes. I like Camar?n a lot. If you like him you can sing. Father, how are you? I'm doing well. How is everything? Don't worry... it's nothing. You'll get better. It's nothing. I enrolled in a program today. The professors are very helpful. I've got an apartment now. My flat mates are really nice. It's right by the sea. I can hear the sea everyday. Would you like to hear it? Wait a second. Did you hear that? My father would always say yes, but I think he only heard traffic. I was prepared to do anything to learn to be Spanish... but I never dreamed that in order to become Spanish... I would have to learn to be Chinese first. Happy New Year! The only friend I made in the restaurant was Joji... a Chinese cook who wasn't Chinese but Japanese... and who wasn't even really a cook, but a sailor. I met Joji in December, but we didn't speak until February... in the middle of Carnival. So, you're going to learn flamenco... and then give classes in Japan? I want to learn to be a cantaora so I can express emotions to someone. It seems to me that there's a big difference between feeling things... in the Japanese way or in the flamenco way. Here I feel things in a way I never did in Japan. - Where are you from? - I'm from Tokyo. And your family? - I don't have a family. - No one? - They died in an accident recently. - Your father and your mother? Yes. And what about you, Joji? My family's in Japan but it's been a long time since I've seen them. My daughter has a life of her own. She works as a designer. I don't worry about her. Doesn't it bother you to go so long without seeing her? Well... once in a while I wonder how she's doing... But I believe we all die alone, without anyone, don't you think? - Yes... - Of course I think about her... I hope she's doing well... I think it's better like this. And you? You don't have to worry. No one's waiting for you there. No, there's no one waiting for me. But I miss it. - You miss Japan? - Yes... Yes, I'm well. The program? Yes, I'm studying pediatrics. As a young girl, my father taught me never to cry in public. I learned to hide it well. That's why, whenever I called him, my father thought I was happy. But the truth is I didn't know what I was feeling on the Island: something just like cante, which is like laughing and crying at once. Camar?n has a song that sounds happy and sad at the same time: "The mirror you look into will show you what you're like... but it will never show you the thoughts inside your head. If what ails you has no cure, I pray to God... that they bury us both in the same grave." - I want to know. The lyrics. - What? The lyrics. - What it says? - Yes. What does it mean? - I want to know. - What are the words? "Why do they say I am bad". Do you know what "bad" means? "When that is not how I am?" It means my heart is not bad. "Why do they say I am bad, when that is not how I am?" "I am from the island" The island is here, San Fernando. "And I have a gift... the same as my brother. Who they call Camar?n". - Do you understand? - Yes. Can't you sing anything of your own? Buler?as or something? Like hum or something? Nothing, right? Nothing. I just listen. But I don't understand yet. Can you say: "Those cunning cart drivers..." "Those cunning cart drivers..." "Those cunning cart drivers..." "One Monday morning..." Again: "Those cunning cart drivers..." "Stole the apples..." "Stole the apples..." "From the poor mule drivers..." "Who came from Totana". Before, I was thinking... - Your hand... - This? Yes. A half moon and one star. A six-pointed star and the moon. Like this one. This is from a long time ago. - Ana and Luis. - My father and mother. What a crowd! I didn't think so many would come. Me neither. It was amazing. Not that many people live here. Where do they come from? I don't know, but today was great. What kind of songs would you like to sing? I want to sing like Camar?n, in just the same way, with his same style... He must be like God to you. They told me that a singer's voice can change, little by little. - Ah... by forcing the throat. - Exactly. I've just begun to learn cante. I still have so much to learn. But one day I will sing like him. With the same voice as Camar?n. - That's not possible. - Why not? You can't have the same voice as another person. I still have so much to learn. I sing so badly. Aren't you getting drunk? I've never gotten drunk, at least not that I remember. I read an article saying that the Japanese can drink a lot. Lies! It's exactly the opposite. Really, I read that the Japanese do not get drunk often. - I don't believe you. - It said so in a book! Japanese get drunk more than anyone. - No, really, I swear. - Are you sure? Although... you do get drunk if you are of mixed blood. Ah. So pure-blooded Japanese don't get drunk. And you're pure-blooded. I must have mixed blood... - What does borracho mean? - I'm a little drunk... I'm borrachillo... Oh! It means drunk! - Let me see how you dance. - Okay, shall we dance? Where is this music from? It's... from somewhere in Europe. - From where? - I don't remember. That's a long time ago now... - How many women did I dance with? - With how many? - How long since you've danced? - I don't remember. That was so long ago... I really don't remember with whom. - Was it with her? - With her? Ah, with her! It's been so long since I danced with her! So, she is the woman. - And how is she? - She's in Japan now. - In Japan? How is she doing? - Well, I think she's okay. You're no longer in touch with her? I haven't kept in touch with her for a long time now. And why is that? I'm always gone... and I never get in touch with her. You know this already - if there's someone very important to you. You shouldn't leave that person. Well... Joji, I told you a lie, just one. About what? I do have parents in Japan. They're in the hospital. My parents don't know anything. Of course, they know I'm here. But they don't know I'm studying cante or anything. - I came here telling a lie. - Why? Why can't you say to your father: "I'm going to Spain for a while... because I need to follow my dream. I don't know. Maybe I only wanted to hide my desire to learn how to sing. - Why? - I don't know. Hello. Yes, this is Makiko. Can you put me through to my father's room? Yes... When did it happen? No, don't worry. I just wasn't expecting it... I didn't think it was going to be so soon... Yes... You learned the rhythm but you hurt your fingers. Put some ice on it, that will fix it. Look how it's gotten. You've earned a pretty bruise. So far, here I have learned the beat. But now I don't know whether to keep learning cante... or go back to Japan. I was going to go back to Japan in a year. But now I'm not sure. I don't really know how to live from now on. In flamenco, the lyrics... have many meanings... and also have so many feelings. So when I sing... I always think about many things. - About Japan and my family. - Of course. But my father died recently. - A few days ago. - And you remember him. I came here even though... my father was sick. Now he has died, and I don't know how to sing. I can't put my feelings in there. You'd like to write a song for your father, is that it? - How long ago did he die? - 10 days ago. 10 days? Ah, a short time. So you just went back to Japan for his funeral? You didn't? He didn't know that I was learning cante. If you go to Japan, what are you going to do over there? I still don't know. I'll work again as a nurse, I guess. You'll work as a nurse, I understand. I will never be able to sing just like Camar?n, and I don't care. LICENSED JAPANESE NURSE AVAILABLE TO CARE FOR ELDERS AND CHILDREN No one has ever sung just like him. What name do you like? Yuca. Sakura, do you like that name better? Say do you prefer Sakura? - It looks like the tide's going down. - It's going down? - I thought it was rising. - Why? Because yesterday at this time it was rising. Well, you see, tides change according to the day. If you've never lived by the sea, you may not know that. - Joji. I have to say goodbye. - What? I've decided to go back to Japan. - So you can see your father. - Yes. You've finally made the decision... I didn't think it was good to be so far away from someone who is ill. It's true. As for the song... you can always sing at any time... but taking care of your father... you may not have another chance. - When are you leaving? - The day after tomorrow. The day after tomorrow... That's so soon. But Maki, I'm glad I met you. Me too. There was no longer anyone waiting for me in Japan. So I could return. Now, back here in my house, I often think of the island. I like to imagine that someone, some day will sing... just like Camar?n even if it's just for one second... but there will be no one there to hear it. I still sing sometimes without even noticing it... especially when I think about my father... and each time I sing, I still cry and laugh at the same time.
