After the market saw abnormal trade volume yesterday, top blue-chip stocks were shorted by a single entity today. The market plummeted by 3,000 points. Bo, why did the delivery take so long? Dude, that address was hard to reach. There's no parking, and there wasn't a lift... Whatever. Deliver this one, too! Come on, I skipped work to help you out. My boss is asking me where I've gone. What? But what about me? Deliver it yourself. I've got no one at the shop. Pay me first, I gotta get to work. Thank you! Hello? Bo! Faces needs a cleaner at 11 tonight. Wanna do it? Yes, definitely! When was the last time you slept? I'm fine! I don't need sleep when there's money! I'm awake! Count me in tonight! We have an insider source who told us that the recent acquisition is related to a rogue trader named Captain Muffin. First of all, I don't know Captain Muffin. Besides, he's a notoriously reclusive figure. No one knows his real identity. He's like Batman! He chooses a different place for every deal. Even the deal where he allegedly made US$3 billion by short selling Dada Bank was done with a group of traders in a Mickey D's. I'll say this again: I don't know Captain Muffin. Where's that tramp? I've called her already. -Hey, guys! -Speak of the devil. -Hey, sorry! -Hi! You look like crap, Bo. Did you come straight from work with no sleep again? You haven't found that bitch Kitty yet? I told you, Bo... you're not Batman. That Kitty is a two-faced, despicable liar. You actually believed that she had breast cancer, AND you agreed to be her guarantor for Tung the loan shark for that 300 grand loan! You're so pigheaded! Stop it, you bitch. I told you last week to not talk about that! We've known all this time that Bo's pigheaded. We can't resent her for doing a pigheaded thing. It's too late to stop her from acting pigheaded, so what's the point of calling her pigheaded? I get it! I'm pigheaded! But I did agree to be responsible for the loan. Now that she's fled, I'll do the right thing and bear the debt for her. Right thing, my ass! This is a loan shark, not "borrowing" money from Buddha. It's real money! I heard Tung was looking for you at Sugar last night! You need to hide out for a while. I hear he's got real nasty fetish. He like cutting up his borrowers' faces. Now, run away! Go, go, go, go, go! Don't you all have work? Cindy! Go upstairs and get to work! Why are you all slacking off out here? It's not like that, Cindy. Bo doesn't feel well today. She needs a night off. What's wrong? -I'm...on my period. It hurts! -That's right! You poor thing! Remember to take some Panadols then! I'm shortstaffed. You're working, no matter what! But Pauline's working, too. I just visited her in the hospital with her brother. What? What happened to her? The silly girl attempted suicide because of a guy. She downed a bottle of dish-washing detergent. Why would she do something like that? I thought she's dating this wonderful, rich boyfriend. They're supposed to get married next year! That guy was just posing as a rich brat, hitting on girls in clubs. He's been conning them the whole time, leeching off their money. He even stole Pauline's credit card, drew 100 grand, then disappeared into thin air! What? What does that asshole look like? I've never seen him before. But from what Pauline told me, he's supposed to be tall and handsome. He also speaks English all the time! Oh, and he likes passing out money to strangers. I'll get revenge for Pauline if I ever see him! Help us all, Bo's turning into Batman again. Worry about Kitty first! Are we in a radio play or something? Get to work! We'll all visit Pauline later. Eat up! It's fresh out of the oven. Go ahead! Eat while it's hot, guys. Go ahead, Ms. Ching. You look so pale, Ms. Ching. Not getting enough sleep? No...No, Boss. Then why do you have such loose lips? You made Captain Muffin sound like he's barely human. I'm more reclusive than Batman? You might as well say that I'm dead. I'm sorry, Boss. It was comedic effect for TV. I know it was, but it wasn't funny! It was a finance program, not a comedy show! Lucky for you that I'm forgiving. If you did that to someone else, your son won't have his mommy around anymore... I'm sorry, Boss. I won't make jokes again. Is everyone present? What are we talking about today? You got a cramp? Speak! Boss, we got a problem with the building reclamation in Mongkok. What's the problem? One of the tenants refuses to leave. I told you last week, block the sewage pipes. They still won't move? We blocked them as ordered, Boss. But those residents are determined. They said they'd rather go to a public toilet than move. What should we do, Boss? I don't care. I need that building for this project. How can I build our new complex without it? Other than murder and arson, deal with them by any means necessary. -You got it? -Got it! Leave it to us, Boss. -I'll make sure it's done. -I'll help make sure, too. Let's talk about the stocks we're shorting tomorrow. I'll only say these stock numbers once. If any of you miss the trade tomorrow, don't bother showing your face to me again. The place is dead tonight. -This sucks. -Come on, it's time to go. Someone's hurling in the toilet, Bo! Come wipe it up! Again? It's my 15th time cleaning this toilet! Don't drink if you can't handle it! Ugh, there's no one here... A stud's coming through! Hey, you look familiar. Remember me? I think you've got the wrong man, sorry. Then let me introduce myself. I'm Manchester. My sister, Chelsea. I'm not a fan of football. Excuse me. Balls aren't just for kicking. You can squeeze them, too! Handball is a red card violation. You're too handsome to be punished. Why don't you buy us a drink, and we'll go over the rules? I have a meeting to go to. This one's on me. Thanks, Boss! "He like to pass out money to strangers, like some rich brat!" The swindler?! What are you doing, Bo? Why are you still here?! I hear that Tung is coming here for you! Pauline's con artist is passing out cash again! Passing, my ass! Get outta here! Keung, where's the car? I'm waiting for you. If you don't show up in 5 minutes, you're fired. You con artist! I'm sorry, I think you got the wrong man, miss. Pauline's in the hospital, and you're still out hitting on girls! Who's Pauline? Your girlfriend! My what? I was hitting on who? You work up there? OK! You want money, right? I'll give you some. What? I don't want your money! -Come with me to the hospital right now! -Just stop. I'm in a mood right now! -So what? -Please leave me alone! -Come on, we're going to see Pauline! -Where? -Hey! Let me go! -Let's go! I don't know you! Get a move on! Tung the loan shark? You nitwit, can't even find a girl! Now I have to find her myself! Hey! What are you doing? What the hell? Block me. Get close. Don't let them see me. Come closer. Stop it! Get closer. Don't move! I'm not in yet. Hey, that itches. Don't say I don't treat you well, Nitwit. Look! Some people can't even afford a room. Hong Kong has a real property problem. Good thing I have assets in the Greater Bay Area, or you'd all be screwed. Thank you, Boss. Don't say a word. OK He's left Bo! Why are you making out here?! Tung brought his gang to look for you! Someone said my name? Shit! Think a make-out session can fool me? No, Tung! I was just about to call you! I already have your money! -Really? -Yeah! Then take it out! I don't have it with me today. Why don't we sit down and talk about it? I get scared when you're mean like this! I'm a gentleman when you're well-behaved. Right? So who's this dude? She got the wrong guy, I'm just passing by. Bye! Hey! I'm not done yet. I saw you two making out just now... Run! Run! Stop, you brat! Help, a molester! -Where the hell are they?! -They're catching up! Take this! Let's go. Hop on! Move it! Hang tight, I drive really fast. We've saved each other, so we're even. Just drop me off at the intersection. Why are we at the hospital?! Stop dragging me! Nurse, where is Pauline Ngau staying? Are you related to her? I'm her BFF! And him? -I don't know her... -He's her boyfriend! What? Don't deny it. Turn right over there. Let's go, you liar. -What boyfriend?! -Come on! Pauline! Pauline! Are you OK? Wake up! What's wrong? Pauline! Please wake up! Pauline! I think she's nuts. I better go... -Where are you going? -Let me go first. -No way! No way! -Just let me go! Let go! Calm down! I don't know you! And I definitely don't know her! Where's your conscience? She attempted suicide after you scammed her money! Now she's in here! And you pretend to not know her? You're a jerk! OK! I get it! You just want money, right? You've put on a good show. Name a price. Call it admission fee for the show. I don't want your damn money. I just want you to return that 100 grand to her. Are you crazy? You must have early psychosis! I don't know you two! What are you talking about? Look at her! She's your girlfriend! Can't you recognize her? -Bo! - I told you, I don't know her! -Bo, we thought you got snatched by Tung! -You scared us! Good thing you're OK. Why are you here? This is Pauline's boyfriend! He scammed her, but he won't admit it... I told you, I'm not her damn boyfriend! Don't make up crap! So you're that scammer! You drove my sister to drink detergent! Now I'm too traumatized to do my dishes! You scared?! Let's be civilized and not get into a fight, OK? You mofo, you think I'm a kid?! Do I look like I need to fight you? I'll just headbutt you! -Why'd you hit him? -Honey! I didn't hit him! -You mofo! Get him! -How dare you hit my man?! -Apologize to my little sister! -Come here. Say sorry! Apologize to her right now! I don't know her! It's a misunderstanding! -Say sorry! Apologize! -Say it! -You won't say it? -You gonna say it? Do it! Ow! ' "'m sorry! She responded! Keep going! Louder, scammer! Say her name! -Say it loud! -Keep going Say it, scammer! What's her name? Pauline! Pauline! I'm sorry! -It's working! Again! -Good job, scammer! Try something else! What do you want?! What do you want? I got an idea! I read this story called "Snow White" when I was a kid. In the story, Snow White passed out for some reason. Then Prince Charming woke her up by making out with her! I got it! Start live streams on Facebook and IG and film this scammer making out with my sister! -Do it 'til she wakes up! -Stop it! Make out with her 'til she wakes up! No way, I don't know her! -Kiss her! -Do it! Kiss her right now! Is this a visit or a party? People are trying to rest! Doctor, check out this scammer! He's going to make out with my sister and she'll wake up in two minutes! You can watch from over there. Get that mouth over! What the hell are you doing?! You'll wake everyone up with that racket! Visiting hour's over! Come back at 10 am! If you lot are still here after I finish my rounds, I'm calling security! Baby, what do we do? Don't argue with that loudmouth ladyboy. It's not worth it. Let's go! What about him? Take him to my place. He'll do my dishes! Then bring him back here tomorrow to make out with Pauline! Go! We'll be back tomorrow, Pauline! -Move it! -Get up, let's go! Please let me go, I beg you. You got the wrong guy! I'm innocent! Get the hell up! I'll pay you if you let me go! Move it, scammer! You skipped dinner or something? If you don't let me go, there'll be trouble, Shanghainese thug! You mofo! I'm from Chaozhou! Think we trust you to not rat us out after all this? Behave yourself tonight. Everything will be fine when Pauline wakes up. What if she doesn't wake up? Then you'll be in deep doo-doo! I'll tie you to a durian and toss you into the sea so you'll die with her! Why's it all dark and empty in here? Our heartless landlord is forcing us out by cutting the utilities! They even blocked the sewage pipes! What a dick! I hope this Ma guy burns in hell! That's right! That's awfully cruel. What's it got to do with you? So why didn't you just move out? That'd be admitting defeat, mofo! Only way I'll leave is if he bombs the place. It's nice to get the building to myself. I made a vow to Duke Guan, I'm here as long as the building stands! Move your ass, scammer! Bo, what are you going to do? I haven't paid off my debt to Tung, and I'll probably lose my job after tonight! I told you a million times to stay away from Kitty. Her boobs are bigger than ours combined. Only you're dumb enough to buy her breast cancer story and borrow money from Tung for her! She spent the cash on a vacation in the Maldives! What will you do now? How will you pay off all that money?! I know I was dumb. I deserve to be looked down on by you. -I'll go! -Hey! If you're taking off, I'll see you out! Shut up, loudmouth! Look, Bo, my baby my baby said all that because she cares. She's been so worried about you! She bought a new bed and new bed sheets for you to stay here! You jerk, we've been friends forever, and you get mad over a few words? I know you care, you jerk! We "Trio Queens of True Light High" are famous for sticking together like glue! Now that Pauline is in a coma because of this asshole, there are only two of us left. Please don't die, Bo. Don't leave me! I wouldn't do that to you! You mofos! You're too sweet! I'll be the third "Queen" for now. I want a hug! Hug it out all you want. Let me get a toilet break! You're such a pest. Go out then to the right! And I need a shower. Do you have a change of clothes? You'll find them in there! Undo my hands! Mofo...Keep hugging, I'll be back. Move it! I was going to use the water for my shower, but I'll let you use it. Count your blessings. Like the shirt I left for you? I doubt you'll want to get caught wearing that. Am I right? But I can call for help! What? No signal?! Forget about phone calls. That asshole landlord of mine jammed the cell signal in here. Just get some sleep. Awesome, the hug is still going! Let me get back in there. Awesome! Help! Snake! Snake! -Snakes! -There's one there, too! Ah... Mofo! Snakes! Help! Help! Hahaha! We got you now. Once the boss knows of our efficiency, he'll give us a "like" for sure! We do so many despicable things. I'm really scared that my kid will bear the karma. What makes you think you'll have a wife? After all these years. Why don't we get married? Doesn't that guy look like the boss? Just stay out of their business. To be honest, I like my men bald. You don't call this balding? You're practically a beast! What's this? And this? And this?! That hurts! You're so clumsy! Are you OK? I sprained my ankle! I'll help you. I can't walk... It hurts! Come on, I'll carry you! -I can't do that to you! -Come on! What are you two doing? You're not letting this prick go, are you? How can we stay up there? Let's call the cops. Cops? Don't. It's not like anyone got murdered. Don't you remember? I'm out on bail! What do we do then? I thought of something just now! Cindy's dad owns a snake soup shop. She's killed snakes all her life. She's tamed my snake, too. I'll bet she's caught them already! Get your ass back up there! Now! Why'd you run away then? There were so many snakes! Anyone would freak! I'm starving! Let's make some snake soup! Put your back into it! Did you use tongue? You mofo scammer! Why won't she wake up? Kiss her 'til she wakes up! I've been kissing her for an hour! What can I do? Were you not passionate enough? Use your tongue! "Fall in love" style! Go! -You try it then. -Sure! Wait, no! That's incest! You do it! Sounds like you're better at it. Get back in there. Her face is pale! -What do we do? -What's going on? Sis! Don't die on me! Little sis! Don't die! I can't live without you! No, little sis! Don't leave me! Wake up! Calm down. Call the doctor. Doc! Right on time, doc. You guys again?! Who took off her oxygen mask?! How else could he make out with her? It's better to do it raw. Make out?! She's in a coma! Whose sick idea is this?! Nothing I say will mean anything... So I won't explain this. Get the hell out, all of you! I'll call the cops if I ever see you in here again! Come on, pervert! -Get out! -Remember to save her! Save her, doc! My sister's all I have! Pauline still isn't up. What do we do now? Why don't you let me go? There's no point keeping him around. Maybe he's the reason why Pauline won't wake up. There's a good chance that you're right. If you want her to wake up, she really shouldn't see me... Think you'll get away with conning 100 grand from my sis? That's all? I can get that with a call! You take me for a fool? Think I'll let you call for help? You're going to work this debt off! What kind of work, baby? I hear that NelNel has a new club opening in a few days. This prick's got a good figure. He can work off the money in just a few months. That guy...uh... Mr. Nell! What does Mr. Nel do? He runs a male host club! But don't worry. For your first day, I'll call my girls over and make you a star! That's not very nice, is it? How so? He'll blow up! I'll talk to NelNel now. I can get a deposit on him. Bo, watch him. Don't let him run away. Me? He's a huge guy. Bo can't handle him alone. Don't worry, I'm prepared. Here! I took this when he was asleep! How can you take a photo like that?! Give that back! How dare you snatch my phone? Don't try to do anything funny! I'll put that photo on Reddit and ruin you! I have to get to work. Come with me! Hurry, we have to get a good spot! How about some fish balls? How's business? As you can tell... With all the jobs you have, how long will it take to make 300 grand? I've got it all figured out. At this pace, I'll cover the principal and the interest in just five years. Five years? Smart, right? You need 5 years to save 300 grand? That's a low bar to set. How can you say that? I work my ass off to make 300 grand! It's made of blood and sweat! Once upon a time, a smart man said, all the money in the world fly within three feet above your head. If you raise your arms and snatch them, you'll manage to get some once in a while. But if you have a chair, you become three feet taller, and you won't have to grab it. It'll come to you naturally! So what you need now is a chair. I don't get it. Simply said, that "chair" can be your education, your connections... or even your looks. But you have none of those. At least look at how much competition you have here. Four other stalls! When supply exceeds demand, you won't succeed unless you have a standout product. Besides, I've tried all the fish ball stalls here. Your fish ball is just like you, mediocre! Look! Every stall here has a line. Every stall except yours. I got it. No one is selling coconut juice here... I should sell that here! That's wrong, too! When a product suddenly disappears from the market, it means something's wrong with it! The E. coli in coconut juice on the streets are off the charts! You want to sell coconut juice in this heat?! Bad business won't be your only problem. If people get sick, you'll go to prison! If nothing works.. Why don't we just call it a night? Don't be so pessimistic. I'll find you a good spot. Where? Smelly tofu! Super smelly tofu! Ten bucks each! How about some smelly tofu? Smelly tofu! How many have you sold? That bathroom break took forever, Mr. Economist. And why would you send me to the middle of nowhere? I haven't sold a single one! I spent two grand on this cart. I have my reasons for setting you up here. There's not a single stall here, so you own the market. In economic theory, you have no competition, so you have a monopoly here. Do you know why I told you to sell smelly tofu? Because it smells! Because it lasts! You don't need to get fresh supplies every day. That's money saved. Your profit can only go up now! That sounds nice on paper, but there's no one here! Uh... What do I do? Well, there's always a gap between external circumstances and subjective will... Just wait! It'll be OK! Wait? But these smelly tofu can't wait. Why don't you help me eat some first? Um...No, thanks. -This piece! -Just wait! -This one is extra smelly! -Smelly tofu can sit for a while! -It really does! - I don't eat smelly tofu. -Try it, you'll come to like it... -I can't... -Try it! -Don't... -My breath will smell like sewage... -Just try it... -You eat it... -Excuse me! Who's in charge here? Want some smelly tofu? My tofu is super smelly. Ten bucks each! I'm asking you, who runs this stall? I do! Then I have to ask you and your stall to scram. You're such a bully. Think you own this street? You've no right to kick us out! You're not allowed to peddle here, especially that kind of crap! What "crap"?! There's no law against selling smelly tofu! And you definitely don't look like the authorities. You don't have the right to do this... Ignore them... How can I get you to leave? Maybe the sauce will make it edible... Name your price! -No amount will make me leave! -300 grand! You'll leave for 300 grand? Right away! Give him 300 grand. Scram once you get the cash and don't let me see you two again. Why are you looking behind your back? I'm worried that someone's following us. Then I'll take the cash back to them! No way, with this money I can pay Tung back! Man, what if that guy was a bad guy? Are we going to get into trouble? Then should I take the cash to the police? No, don't! What if the money's stolen? Then we'll end up in jail. Sure! But you bagged the money, so you'll be the one in trouble. Wait, I got an idea. Here's 100 grand. Take it. Why? Making me an accomplice? No, you owe Pauline 100 grand, right? Wing's going to make you a gigolo, but you look way too frail make it out alive. Go pay Wing with that money, then you'll be free! But promise me that you'll visit Pauline more often. She really does love you! What about the debt? I have 200 grand already. The rest will be easy to make! I'd rather sell fish balls than have you sell your body. Are you nuts? You put my problem over your own? Take this back. I don't want it. Pauline's my BFF, so her boyfriend's my friend too! I'll be fine. I need to get to my next job, so don't call me unless you need to! Hello? Something's wrong with Pauline! Sir, calm down! How can this be? Get a hold of yourself, please! Why... Pauline...Pauline...Why didn't you wait for me? Pauline! Pauline! I miss you so much... How could you do this?! How can you just leave me? Pauline... Why are you crying, bitch? I'm right here! Pauline! Are you OK? How am I not OK? What happened? When did you wake up? Don't pinch me! You're ruining my makeup! This is real? When did you wake up? I don't remember. I just remember being in a deep sleep and seeing a white tunnel. When I was about to walk to it, all the lights went out. It was all dark. When the lights came back, I found myself here. That sounds awfully fantastic. Stranger things have happened. The hospital did have a power outage for three hours. All the equipment's fuses got burned. After emergency maintenance, the equipment came back online. Later, Ms. Ngau miraculously woke up, along with a few long-time comatose patients. This electrical resuscitation thing is totally worth looking into! You said something happened to her, Wing! You mofo! My sister was in a coma! Making out didn't even work on her, but now she's back! Isn't that something? You scared me to death! Bo, when did you get a new boyfriend? Him? He's your boyfriend. What? Do I know you, pal? Sis, did the coma screw up your brain? This scammer's the one who drove you to suicide! -Exactly! -No way! My boy is really hot, unlike him. He's not even close! Pauline, do you have amnesia? Look closer! Did you forget his face? What? You're all crazy. Look at this! Look at how sexy and handsome my baby is! He's so cute. This guy isn't even close! She's right about that. You mofo. Doc! Check my sister's brain when you're free. So if you're not Pauline's boyfriend, then who are you? I haven't introduced myself yet. My name is Finn Ma. Fin? Like on the shark? With two n's, wordsmith! Sorry for troubling you, Mr. Ma! We didn't mean to. Please have mercy and forgive us. It's fine. I had fun. Oh, yeah. Hold on to this. Keep it safe Don't trust people so easily anymore. I'm off! What did that mean? Yung, what's going with your hold? It's done. I made $12 million. I think I can do better! Keep it up. Slacking off while I'm away? -Boss! Where have you been?! -Boss! You know I don't tell anyone that. Boss knows what he's doing! Boss, have a muffin. Don't worry, Boss, I made US$30 million for you while you were away. I made 12 million of that. I still made 18! I'm the better one! Good. And what about the thing I asked you to do? Kam, do something for me. Mr. Kam! Tsui, what the hell did you do? What happened? My boss likes your land because it's neat and clean. As I told you before, he's a serious germophobe and a radical environmentalist. But he said he just saw a smelly tofu stall there! You don't want to be in business with us anymore? Smelly tofu? You want us to deal with that? I don't care how you do it, just get rid of that stall. I'll be there in an hour. If I even smell a tinge of smelly tofu, then the deal's off! No, Mr. Kam! Our company... needs that money to turn itself around! My boss is fuming, man. I can put in a word for you... -if you cut the price! -By how much? -Thirty mil! -Thirty mil?! That's just 10%! Too much? Then you'll lose 300 mil! Fine, 30 million! Good man! We're buddies. You know I wouldn't cheat you. You should take me out dancing! I'm heading over now. Remember, keep it neat and clean. Nothing dirty! Don't worry, I'll spend whatever I need to get rid of it! Don't worry, Mr. Kam. You're amazing, Boss. You saved 30 million with a smelly tofu stall. The girl's more amazing, she made 300 grand by doing nothing. Why were you so generous? Because she's kind. Check out our store, miss. Take one! Cheap, delicious hot dogs! Mr. Ma? What a coincidence. Call me Finn. How are you? What's this about? It's a hot dog. Can't you tell? Done with work? Yeah! -Want to get something to eat? -Sure! Get in the car! -Let's go! -Get changed first! Oh, yeah! Hello? Kid, it's Nitwit! Nitwit? Who's that? Loan shark Tung's right-hand man! I have your friend Kitty. Bring 500 grand to Chi Kee Sawmill & Timber or she dies! Save me, Bo! -Hello? Hello? -What's up? My friend's in trouble! I'll go with you! Boss! I'm killing someone here! They said they're here to save Kitty. Kitty! I'm here! Bo...Help me! Tung, let her down right now! This isn't a restaurant, you can't order me around. Pay up, and I'll her go! How much does she owe you? Not much. Just 500 grand. Why did you borrow so much again, Kitty?! I lied to you about having breast cancer. I actually spent that 300 grand on a vacation in the Maldives. But I fell ill when I came back, so I went to see the doctor. What the hell... I got diagnosed with breast cancer! Karma really does exist in the world! You could've just seen a doctor! Why'd you borrow from this prick? My friend says there's a miracle worker who can cure my cancer for 500 grand. But the miracle worker vanished after I paid him... I know that dude! He's long gone! It was on Hong Kong's Most Wanted, idiot! Don't be scared, Kitty! You won't walk this road alone! I'll be there for you! I'll pay the debt for her! Are you crazy? You just cleared 300 grand! What's going on, Kitty? I forgot to tell you... The cancer has already spread to my brain. I don't want to die here! Help me! Don't worry, we'll get through this together! I'll take care of it! I'll take care of her debt. Let her go! You're a loyal friend, kid! Look, my firm's been around for over a decade now. We've always had great credit. Here's the IOU...take a look! -Here's your name... -Go away, you rat! If there's no problem, sign right here... Sure! -Let me borrow a pen. -Sure. Pardon me. Bo, wait! You loudmouth! I haven't even gotten revenge for your girl bashing me last time. Get him, boys! Settle down... Settle down... Point that at him, man! Calm down, man... Put that down. Let's talk. What's going on? Let her answer that. Wake up, dude! Kitty, are you OK? Show's over! Show? Let's go to the hospital. You still don't know that it's a scam? Are you stupid? You're lying to me? Do I have to explain everything? Last time you paid back 300 grand in less than 3 months. I thought, you either won the lottery or you met a rich guy. So I got Tung to help dupe you again for another huge payday! But I had no idea you got a clever friend. Good work! I've known you since primary school. How can you do this? And I've been swindling you since then. Wake up! When I cheated on tests, you took the blame. When I say I left my wallet at home, you paid for me. I told you I have breast cancer! It's absurd, but you believed it again! You're the perfect mark! Just blame yourself for being an idiot. I've thought of you as a friend all this time. I gave you so many chances, hoping that you'd change. Me change? You're the one that needs to change! Smarten up and stop getting duped all the time! This happened because you're stupid! Dummy! I hate you! I hate you! Bo...Bo... Tung, this is all my fault! I didn't know she'd be so hard to dupe this time! It's fine, let's treat this as an exercise! I'm sure we're all starving. Let's go eat and sing Karaoke. My mom's a real idiot. I'll find a way to get her. I'm sure we'll make a fortune! Let's go eat! You're a real scum! First your friend, then your mom? I may be a loan shark, but I have morals! Nitwit, get some guys to hang her back up... -Tung, you can't be for real? -How, boss? -Remember that SM book you read in Japan? -Yeah! Bring it to life! Sounds good! Hey! Yes? Tie her up tight, but don't make me use the saw like last time. Sure! I may be in makeup, but I ain't a psycho. Am I really that pigheaded? I haven't known you that long... But you see me at my dumbest every time! I'm so embarrassed... Just be smarter next time! All I did was trust my friend. Is that so wrong? Let me tell you something... Putting your trust in someone is always a high-risk investment. Set a stop order point and protect yourself. That's tiring. I have to calculate loss and benefits in all my friendships? Aren't you tired now? Look at you, staring idly at the ocean! I wish I was Nobita from that comic. What are you talking about? Every time Nobita screws up, Doraemon shows up to save him. There aren't many of those out there. You save me every time I screw up. You're my Doraemon! Thank you, Doraemon! Are you trying to cop a feel? No, this is from the heart. Don't leave me, Doraemon... 6 months later Good morning, Ms. Chung. Morning! Breakfast is ready! Thanks. Ms. Chung, are you happy with the food? It's OK. But I want fried dough sticks and pizza tomorrow. I haven't had soda in forever! Mr. Ma says that those items aren't healthy. It's better if you don't have them! Alright... Thanks... How are the English lessons going? Did you skip class again? Of course not! The tutor says I've gotten better! "How do you do?" That's my girl! It's good for you to learn more English. Start taking Mandarin lessons next month, too. What? Another language? You're the one who's bored at home, so study. I can't be here with you all the time. Where are you going next? You know I can't tell you. I know it's confidential... Why are you pouting? Cindy's birthday is next week. I'm planning a party, and I want you to come. You haven't seen her in a while. Next week? I'm not free next week. Wish her a happy birthday for me. And buy her an extra present on me. Hello? Tell him I'm almost there. OK! You're meeting someone? Card game with old classmates. I haven't seen them in a while. Take me along. You'll get bored. It's fine. I love being bored. I want to spend more time with you. I've only seen you once this month. Please Don't resent me if you get bored. I just want to be with you. But we've ordered so much food. We'll go if you finish everything. What? There's so much! In three minutes! Ready? Three, two, one...big bites! Thanks, boss. Sorry I haven't introduced her. This is Bo! Henry and Kevin. Hi! You should introduce your girls, too. You don't need to. It's Katy and Maggie! I watch your TV series all the time! You look even prettier in person. Let me see? You really are pretty! Turns out you really do have fans. Why are you laughing? She's saying you're ugly on camera! That's terrible. Get some makeup on, you two. Don't embarrass me! Go on! I fold. You still in? Sure! Finn, any chance that stock 2230 will go up? Leave me some shares if it will! Don't take it all for yourself! You didn't leave me any of the allotment last month, either. Come on, Kevin. You should beware of Finn's recommendations. -Why? -Don't you remember? He gave me a number last time, turns out he just wanted me to help dilute the stock! What do you call that? You only hurt the ones you know! Give me a break, Henry. I told you to sell at $5.50. You got greedy and waited for it to hit $7.50. You should've told me you were selling! This is how stocks are played. It's not your first time at the rodeo. Call it lesson learned. What the hell, man?! I almost forgot that I've got good news. I bought a new boat last week. Let's have a junk trip! You wanna come, fan girl? Oh...Sure. You just bought a boat last year. It was a bargain! It belonged to Sunny Poon. Is he in trouble? He's selling everything. Everyone knows! His company lost a fortune on real estate in the US. I cut a great deal since he's desperate for cash. Really? No way you didn't know, Finn. Did your ex Susan ask you to help her hubby out? Susan really missed out. She chose that rich brat over him. You must feel vindicated, right? I can tell! Feels like a breath of cool air. You're so bad, man! What do you think? Are you two in cahoots? Why did you distract me? I just lost! I lost, too! I'll get someone to hack you to pieces! Let's see if I get to you first! What is this?! I've called the magazine's editor. He said it was leaked by Katy, Henry's new girlfriend. Katy has a new series out. She wanted to get on the tabloids to promote herself... Why isn't there a single photo of her and Henry then? The editor saw the photos and thought you and Ms. Chung made a juicier headline. So it was an accident. We've put pressure on the editor already. He agreed to not do a follow-up story. We've gotten a lot of calls this morning all congratulating you and Ms. Chung. They said you two look great together. Spare me the crap! The shareholders and partners have doubts about her background. They're not very happy about this. How is my love life their business? It actually is. Our stock price has dropped by 2% since the magazine came out. It may be a minor drop, but we can't ignore that your relationship with Ms. Chung can bring risk to the company's investment outlook. Are you crazy? Bo is an ordinary girl. How can she affect stock prices? She actually can, Boss. When you and Susan Kwan broke up three years ago and she married Sunny Poon less than 6 months later, we lost several large development bids to Sunny Poon's company by very small margins. The rumors were everywhere, saying that Susan was a spy planted by Sunny. That was an accident, but we may not be so lucky next time. What's the solution? This is a Relationship Agreement for you and Ms. Chung. This says that when Ms. Chung is with you, she must remain mum about your business or your lifestyle. If you two break up one day, then she will receive a significant payment as long as she doesn't reveal details of your relationship in a book or a film... This kind of agreement is normal overseas. Leonardo DiCaprio signs one with all the girls he dates. We're just dating, not getting married! You worried I'll leave her my assets? If you do marry Ms. Chung one day, the document would be a lot thicker. I won't sign, and Bo certainly won't. Next! Mrs. Ma asked us to make the contract. She came back from LA last night. These two necklaces are the latest designs, Mrs. Ma Please take a look. We can make modifications if you need them. Mr. Ma. Mom! Finn! Come here. Tell me, which necklace do you like better? Anything looks good on you, Mom. The one on the left. I thought so, too. I'll take this one. Certainly. Thank you, Mrs. Ma. This way, please. I called you last week, but you didn't answer. Where were you? You know I can't tell you. You know whom I'm buying that for? Susan's birthday is next week. Are you bored? Why do you care about that? True, I didn't like you two dating back then. But since you split, she'd visit me regularly. I had no idea that she was such a proper lady. I started to doubt if you were wrong to lose her. Say, I heard that you got a new girlfriend. When will I get to meet her? Later. I want to make sure that she won't disappoint you. Hmm..sure. If you're serious, don't hold off on marriage. Sorry, we weren't notified of visitors. You can't come in. Come on! They checked our phones and everything downstairs. We really are Bo's friends! Go inside and ask her. We're here for your boss' girl, not you! Back off, lady! You mofo, is he the president or something? Want a cavity search too? If you three keep causing trouble, I'll call security! Go to hell! -How arrogant! -Bo, we're here! Are you being held prisoner? Bo! Cindy, you guys are late! We were on time, but the damn guards wouldn't let us up. Now this hag is in the way! Ms. Chung... They're my friends. But Mr. Ma said all visitors must have appointments. I'll talk to him later. This isn't protocol... I said I'll talk to him. OK, I'll get back to work then. Go away! Come on, I got tons of food! -Great! -I'm starving! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to baby (Cindy). Happy birthday to you! Thanks, you guys. This cake is gorgeous! Thank you, Bo! Make a wish! I want to be like Bo and snag a billionaire. Then I'll chill and never work again! How can you say that, baby? Am I dead to you? I'm sitting right here! I was kidding! But you have to work hard or I'll dump you for a rich guy! No, baby! Don't dump me! Don't abandon my big snake! I told you I was kidding! I love your big snake too much! What's wrong, Bo? Feeling ill? I'm fine. Argument with the boyfriend? That's absurd. I only see him a few times a month. We don't even have time to chat, let alone argue. Why don't you come see us if you're here all alone? Exactly. You two are so lovey dovey, I don't want to interrupt. To be honest, we really want to see you, but it's so hard! -First, we have to make an appointment... -I know! And they check our phones! It's like going through the gauntlet! But we're really worried about you! Are you alright? You can tell us anything. You really can! Are you alright? Why wouldn't I be, you dummies? I've always wanted to live off a rich guy. Now I've got him. Look how happy I am! Really? I figured that I'll pop out a few babies so I can get a piece of the pie if he dumps me. That's smart! I knew that you're not serious about him. -You're just with him for the money! -Totally! I didn't realize you were so greedy! That's very nice. So what about next week? Do you have a time to visit my lesson? So I will see you next week. -See you. Bye bye! -Bye bye! Hello, Ms. Chung. Who are you? I don't know you. Mrs. Ma wants to see you. My car is over there. Please come with me. Mrs. Ma hates late arrivals. Ms. Chung, sorry to summon you out of the blue. It's fine, Mrs. Ma. Just call me Bo. Then that's what I'll do. I'm sorry, I should've paid you a visit earlier, but.. Finn said that his mother's a handful? No, no, no... Finn said that he'll bring me over when he's less busy. And when is he ever less busy? You're going to classes every day? Language classes every other day plus computer classes. Finn asked you to take them? How are the classes going then? Not bad. I was a lazy student, so |I'm catching up now. Give it your best. Definitely. You haven't eaten yet, right? Not yet. Help yourself. You first, Mrs. Ma. You go first. They all look delicious. Go on. Delicious. Hello? Still up? Yeah, I was waiting for you! I told you not to wait up for me. Then why are you calling now? So do you miss me? I miss you tons! When are you coming home? Soon, very soon. Get to sleep, it's late... Did you know that your mother invited me over today? She called you over? Yeah. Did she say anything that scared you? Not really. She's quite nice! Not many people say that about her. She asked me to go to her birthday party next week. Will you go? I won't be in town. Then I'll have to go by myself. Don't be scared. She did invite you after all. But I'll be all alone. I'm worried... You just said that she's nice. Anyway, I have a meeting. Wait! What is it? I want to hear a song! You want me to sing again? Can you? There are people outside... Come on, I can't sleep. "I call you Jade Butterfly, beautiful whether you fly or not" "You're the Flower of Love, the Yarn in the Wind" "Which name matches your majesty?" "You're a butterfly anywhere, beautiful whether you fly or not" "All those names are you, Yusei Haya is even more like you" "Which name matches your majesty?" "I'm so intoxicated...” See that? That's Finn Ma's new girlfriend! That's how she looks? Finn's taste in woman has gotten so much worse. He used to eat shark fin, now he likes vermicelli. I bought the outfit for this party. Isn't it sexy? It is! Check out the back! Who is that? I've never seen her before... Who'd invite someone like that? At you! Why? I don't know her. What was that for? Do you mind if I sit down? Of course not. I noticed that you didn't get any food, so I got you some. Thank you! I don't know what you like, so I just grabbed something. It's fine! I can eat anything. I'm Bo. And you? I'm Susan Kwan. You know who I am, don't you? How's Finn? Still flying all the time for work? Say hi to him for me. Sure. Your hairstyle looks nice. Really? Thanks! What a great party tonight, godsister. A lot of your friends are here! There's Mrs. Ma! Happy birthday, Sabrina! Happy birthday! I wish you eternal beauty. I wish you eternal youth. Hope you'll look fit forever! -Thank you. -Let's have a toast! Sure! Cheers! I chose the cake for you. Do you like it? It's so beautiful. I love it! It's not as beautiful as you! You're too sweet. Now that we're all here, let's cut the cake. Sure! Jason, call Bo and Susan over. Yes, Mrs. Ma. Mrs. Ma wants you to join the cake cutting. Let's go -Come over here. -Move out of the way. Are they that close? Happy birthday, Mrs. Ma! Thank you. Now we can sing the birthday song. Sure! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to Sabrina! Happy birthday to you! Make a wish! Yay! Cut the cake! Bo, let's cut it together. Sure! Please call if you need anything else, Mr. Ma. Enjoy. Cheers! Nice of my mom to have you cut the cake with her. She asked me to eat with her and Janet next week. But Janet doesn't seem to like me. My mom likes you, no one would dare to bully you. I didn't know that they're so fake. Oh, and I met someone at the birthday party. Who? Susan. How did you run into her? She saw that I was bored, so she came by to chat. What is she up to? Don't say that. She's pretty nice! Her chatting you up doesn't make her nice. How old are you? Don't be so naive! No wonder you keep getting duped. The board is taken care of. Push the price down as low as you can. His cash flow should be gone by now. I want Sunny Poon to go down for good. Just do as I say. Still up? So are you. Let's go to bed. Can you sleep at night? What are you saying? You're destroying his company. How do you sleep at night? I told you to stay out of my business. One, you don't get it. Two, it's none of your business. Susan is your ex-girlfriend, how can you do that to her? As you said, she's the ex-girlfriend, not the current one. So it doesn't matter! That's business, I buy and sell as I see fit. Who are you to butt in on my business? You're holding a grudge. She dumped you, and now you want revenge! Why would I spend 3 billion on "revenge"? You think too highly of that woman. Still, this deal does feel a little different. Aside from the money, I feel a bit of vindication. Don't you have a conscience? Do you regret seeing the real me? I never thought you'd be like this. If you can't stand the heat, stay out of the kitchen. By the way, I have something to talk to you about. What is that? Read it. If you don't get it, I'll have Kam explain it. I asked you what that is. It's a Relationship Agreement. I think we should make some things clear in this relationship. If we break up, we won't have any dispute. What kind of dispute do you foresee? You're worried I'll ask you for money? The answer to that is on page 13. If we do break up, you'll get a generous payment. Of course, if you're not happy with it, I'm happy to discuss it in the presence of a lawyer. You think that I'm only with you for money? Are you not? You said so. Did you forget already? "I've always wanted to live off a rich guy." "Now I've got him, look how happy I am!" "I knew that you're not serious about him." "You're just with him for the money!" "I knew it, he's so ugly!" Mrs. Ma, I've done your bidding. Surely you don't believe that fairy tales still exist. It's not what you think! Remember I told you about Cindy's birthday? They came up for the birthday party. They thought I was unhappy and got worried. I wasn't unhappy, so I exaggerated a little. -Then they said... -That's enough. Let me finish! I just made some excuse. I'm not what you think I am! I'm not greedy! Forget it! What's wrong with being in love with my money? Everyone loves money. From the first day we were together, I told myself, "Who would like me just for me and not my money?" I can't change the fact that I'm rich. Remember what I told you? Trusting someone is a high-risk investment and you should set a stop order point. This agreement is our stop order point. If you sign it, then I'll forget everything and we'll stay together. If you don't sign it, it means there's no stop order point. Under an undesirable investment outlook I'll be forced to sell. So to you, this whole relationship has just been an investment? I think the feeling's mutual. So we break up, if I don't sign it? I asked you a question! Answer me! Think it over. I have a meeting tomorrow. I'm not staying here tonight. Remember, Kam, don't sell 'til it's at $7.50. Tell Richard, it's not $7.40, not $7.45, I won't agree to a cent less! Got it. Wah, what's going on with the hotel? Can we talk? It's fine, it's nothing confidential. It's OK for you all to stay. Sit down. Listen and offer comments. Have you thought it through? Before I sign this, promise me something. If you want to change any item, I'll have Kam follow up. Before I sign your agreement, I want you to sign mine as well. Sign what? I spent all night on this. Look... Yung, take a look. Boss, you should look at it yourself... It's fine! I'll read it out loud... "This is an Agreement between you, Finn, and me, Bo." "We hereby vow..." "To be honest with each other in our relationship." "And to report our movements every day." "Calls must be answered and no going AWOL." "You can't call me fat, dumb and lazy." "On holidays like Valentine's, Christmas and anniversaries," "we will think of thoughtful gifts and ways to celebrate..." That's enough! If you sign my agreeement, I'll sign yours. If we break up, I promise that I won't take a cent... Boss, I've made a risk assessment. It's a good deal, sign it! Are you messing with me, Bo? I'm messing with you? I've done everything your way. What else do you want? I've always made the rules. Who are you to talk about rules?! I'm the one that love you. You love me, too. It's that simple. Sorry, I'm not signing your agreement. I won't accept items that I can never achieve. It's not that you can't. You just don't want to! You've been selfish all along. You never thought about becoming better for the one you love! Finn You've always had your muffins on the peak and I'll keep eating my smelly tofu in the ghetto. We're from completely different worlds. There's no tofu on the peak, and it won't snow in the ghetto. Doraemon... Thanks for making me happy for the past six months. You made many of my dreams come true. But they're incomplete without you in it. Let's break up. Remember to get the tofu out. Don't worry, I got it. Why don't you ask me what happened? We're BFFs, I'll listen to whatever you want to say. Even if you say nothing, I still have your back. As long as you're here, I have your room and board covered. Really? Did you make a fortune? Something like that! I took over your smelly tofu cart and business's been good. I think we can get a proper shop soon... That good? Of course! Ever since we got the cart, -Wing's been behaving much better. -Fresh off the fryer! -He's so hardworking now. -How many Do you want? He says he wants to be Hong Kong's King of Smelly Tofus and he vows to give me a good life. I'm happy for you. Picking a man isn't so hard. You don't need to pick a rich one. Just pick one that really loves you. Have you heard? There are at least five essential "yous" in a relationship. "Whatever you want," "Worried about you," "I miss you,""You win," and "I can't live without you." Did you just make that up? It's wisdom! Wing has all five of those, so I've got him good now! There are plenty of fishes in the sea. I know all the peddlers on this street. I'll introduce you to fish ball Keung tomorrow. Steamed rice roll Wing is pretty nice, too. But they're both so good that you won't know who to pick when you fall for them both. But I like siu mai... Oh, no! The siu mai cart's owned by a middle-aged lady. That sucks! -Mofo! That's really hot! Ow! -That's the King of Smelly Tofu... I'll be right back. Help! Are you OK? Let me do the frying. Ow! I'll kiss it away. I'll kiss it away, too! -It doesn't hurt that much. -Be careful! Good morning, Mr. Ma. You have a guest. It's been a long time. How have you been? I closed a deal recently. I bought out an old-school family company. Then I broke it up and made a fortune. I'm so happy! Did you come here to beg mercy for your husband, or did you come to tell me how much you regret picking him over me? I came here to thank you. For making your husband lose half his money? Sunny has never liked doing business. His family gave him a lot of pressure to run the family business. I could see that he was in pain. Yet I couldn't do a thing. It was painful for me, too. But when you bought out his company, he finally had the excuse to walk away. He's a lot happier now. Finn...money can solve problems, but it can't buy happiness. Sunny and I lost a lot of money, but we're happy now. Cut the crap. You've always been a gold digger. I know you still haven't let go, but I want to tell you... I was never with you for your money. You just never put your heart into the relationship. You spent all your time on work... not on me. If it makes you feel better to think that I broke up with you because of money, then go ahead. But I think you'll change because you're lucky enough to find a good girl like Bo! Bo came to see me a while ago. Bo, is something wrong? You can tell me anything. You must be angry about what Finn did to your husband. You must think that he did it out of revenge. You think so, too? I haven't known you very long, but you're not what Finn or other people say you are. Finn really went too far. I'm not here to defend him. And...he's not worth defending this time. What are you trying to say? I'm not good at expressing myself. But I want to...apologize on Finn's behalf. He's stubborn, bullheaded and competitive as hell, but he's not a bad person. You two had a lot of misunderstandings and they may never be resolved. Susan, if it's possible, I hope you'll come to forgive Finn. Why are you doing this? Because it's terrible to be misunderstood. I've been there, so I don't want you to misunderstand Finn. You really do love him. But we've broken up. Why? After speaking to Bo, I needed to see you. At least one of us should try to clear up our misunderstanding. You may not accept my answer, but I feel a lot better now that I've said it. I've let go. I hope you will, too. I'll leave it to you to solve your problem with Bo. Giving her a chance is giving yourself a chance. You've lost weight recently. Really? Eat more. I will. It's about time for your body check. I'll call Doctor Lee for you. Sure. Thanks. I'm going to LA tomorrow. I'll be back next Thursday. Let's have dinner when I come back. Let me check my schedule. I'll let you know if I'm free. Smelly tofu! Real smelly! Ten dollars each! Each! Buy two, get one free! Get one free! It's awfully quiet today. You can handle things on your own, right? I need to go somewhere. Where are you off to? Getting a lottery ticket! When did you become a gambler? You got this covered! Stinky tofu! It's been a while. Didn't think you'd be peddling here. How's business? Great, of course! We were on TV recently. Want to try one? Not yet. What brings you here? This isn't your kind of neighborhood. I came to see you. I taped it back together myself. It's signed. Can we get back together? I told you we're from different worlds. It won't snow down here. Not necessarily. If it can snow here, then we can be together again. Don't leave me! Thanks for showing me snow for the first time. But can you get someone to love you without using money? You said you want to be Nobita and you want a Doraemon to protect you. I remember that. I'll always be your Doraemon. My magical pocket will make all your wishes come true. Guess what magical gadget I have for you today? I'm not here to get my girlfriend back. I'm here for my wife. Marry me. Hurry, we need more snow on the right! I'm on it! Shut up and don't touch me! We're spending so much energy on this. Is it really enough? If my boyfriend does this for me, I'll marry him on the spot! I'm not bad, you know. I like men with hair. You call this bald? You call that hair? What is this? And this?! Shut up and get me a pack of cigarettes. And six bottles of beer! OK. Move it! Sis...Sis... Calm down and call the doctor. Can you see me? I can see you! What? Kiss him? I remember now! Look at you... I remember now! Cindy's dad owns a snake soup shop. -30 million! -I'm not leaving! -30 million? -That's a lot. 300 grand... I need to make you smelly tofu... What's going on? That itches. What's going on? I'm supposed to pull you up. Cut! Sorry! Hit him! What are you doing? You won't hit me on cue, but you hit me without one! Baby, where have you been? I missed you! This guy looks familiar. Baby! Who are you talking to? I missed you so much! What's going on? Where have you been? Miss, can you please behave? I know I'm attractive and plenty of women want me. But I'm not that easy... Don't leave me again, baby! Give me a kiss! Hey, miss! Don't do this, alright? Let's talk. At your place or mine? Anywhere is fine! My place, then. I live in Kowloon Tong. Huh, fairy tales do come true... Want a Popsicle? I don't want to eat that. Then what do you want to eat? You know what I want! How about a sausage? -You're so naughty! -Am I? I'll whip one out right now.
