[screaming] - This is me and me dad. He's the one flying out of the urn. Rest in peace, Dad. - Very dangerous, what you did. - Oops. I wasn't really thinking about the people sitting behind us. He wouldn't have liked that much. He was never an in-your-face sort of person. - Never do that again. Right? - He was a quiet man, Harold Smith. Now, this is the story of something special me dad did for me a long time ago. Something very special. It was 1977. It was "the year of the Fever.” [Bee Gees' "Saturday Night Fever"] [knock-knock!] - Eight o'clock, Vince. - Ta, Dad. - Oi! [music stops abruptly] What are you doing?! What's a matter with you? You're stealing my apple! Don't do things like that, eh? Pay me. - I was lucky enough to be employed at Nesbitt Solo, South Yorkshire's most stylish law firm. Me boss, Mr. Keith Nesbitt, was affectionately known by us workers as "Turd-Tache," on account of the large, furry rodent stuck to his upper lip. It was Nesbitt who coined the firm's catchy motto: "Justice with Style." I was a junior trainee legal clerk. - Again, please. By lunchtime. - But it wasn't all bad. In fact, in some ways, it was brilliant. Because that was where I first met... Joanna. - ... with the outstanding discoveries... - Her dad was a teacher at the university. A man of science. He knew exactly how things happened the way they did, and why. He lived his life to a strict set of rules. - Ladies and gentlemen, Uri Gellar. [applause] - Actually, what I do is... - Me dad lived his life to a strict set of rules, as well. As long as he had his pipe and his telly, [dring!] he was just fine. - Harold Smith. - Is Irene there? - If you wait a minute, I'll just call her. Irene? - Hello? - Me mum did what she could to keep busy. - Hello. Who? Barry? Oh, yeah, I remember Barry the Bum from the Roxy. How are you, Barry the Bum? - All right. - In fact, we were all fine. Not your standard modern family, yet we were happy enough. But then, we had no idea what was about to happen. - Look, if it's very... [laughter and applause] - Merry Christmas. - Do you want a hand? - No, it's... it's all right. - Oh, go on. We'll get it done in no time. - No. Really. - Suit yourself. This is for you. - What is it? - What do you think? - A card. A Christmas card. - Merry Christmas. [dog barking] - Merry Christmas, Dad. - Merry Christmas, Vince. - Merry Christmas, Mum. Merry Christmas. [rattling] - Ah! [TV]: And all because Sunsilk's chosen some of the wildest things under the sun, like limes and peaches and coconuts, to enrich... - Huh! [TV]: Choose one and wash sunshine into your hair. [laughter] The minute he walked in the joint - Christmas was always a good laugh at our house. Aunt Madge always turned up with this funny old bloke she looked after, Oobie. Wouldn't you like to know what's going on In my mind - No! We would not! - One of the family traditions was that everyone had to do a little party piece. - Come on, Ray. - Okay. - Come on, Ray, show us what you can do. - Ray. Ray, nothing. the Mighty Zankini. S'il vous plait. - Oh! - Me older brother was a professional entertainer. A magician. [applause] He didn't realize he was crap. Empty, as me dad's head. He were hoping to get booked on this prestigious Norwegian cruise ship. - Oh, stronger than me dad's brain! - Oh, give over, Ray! - "Give over, Ray." Open your gob, Dad. [squealing] I knew he were good for summat. - That's magic. [dring!] - Hello? Hold on. Mother. - What? Oh. Uh... - Hey, Ray? Would the Mighty Zankini like to appear at Mrs. Battersby's 100th at the home? - Talk to me agent. - Who was that on the phone? - Betty. I can't see what's wrong with your name. - Oh, right, that'll look good up in lights. You know, at the Palladium. Ray Smith. Bloody magic that is. All right, I've done my turn. Come on, then, Alvin. - Oh, no. It's me dad's turn. - What? Don't be daft. - Go on. You can do something, eh, Dad. - Well, I... I suppose I could try... doing a little trick. [humming Christmas song] - Quick, quick, quick. - Right. Now, my gifts for you three. Joanna, you wanted a record token; Lucy, a novel; and Margaret, a new handbag. - Yes. - Well, you might've noticed there's just one envelope left in the Christmas tree. You all know my feelings on religious rituals in general on Christmas in particular, but in essence, there is value in the concept of giving. So this year, my gift to you three is... the gift of giving. Joanna, I'd like you to do the honours. Just read it. - "Dear Margaret, Joanna and Lucy, "my name is N'diri Kimwa." Dad, this is your writing. - Written on behalf of one not privileged in education. - "Il live in the village of Obika in Sudan. "The money that your father "would've spent on the bourgeois presents you asked for "has been sent to my village, where it will contribute "to the building of a well. His gift to you is yours to me. "N'diri Kimwa." Thanks, Dad. - Yes, thank you, Peter. - What a lovely idea! - All right. [giggling] Right, I'll... I'll just concentrate. Um. if... if you could do the same, Ray. - All right, Dad. - Are you picturing it? - I am picturing it. - No, you're not. - Yes, I bloody am. - Could you picture it a bit harder? - This hard enough? - Yes. Got it. - The idea was, Ray would write a number inside a shape, and Dad would try to read his mind. - All right, then, Dad. Astound us. - Hey! You got it! Oobie, did you see that? Wasn't that brilliant, Ray? - Old-oldest trick in the book, that. Yeah, not bad. Not bad, Dad. A bit wooden. Need to work on the patter, zing it up a bit. - All right, how'd he do it, then? - Oh, piss off. - Right, then. Take your places. Let's show some respect. - Oh! Right. Come on, it's time for the queen, Oobie. ... noble Queen God save the Queen... Send her victorious Happy and glorious Long to reign over us God save... The Queen - How'd you do it, Dad? - Oh, there was nothing clever about it. Not like your stuff. When you got the egg out-- - Dad. How'd you do it? - Do what? - Uh, Ray were asking how I did me party piece. - What? No, I weren't! - Thought it were the oldest trick in the book. - Yeah, well... Ah, fuck off. - Surely no mystery to the Mighty Zankini! Christmas was over, and my New Year's resolution... was to ask Joanna out. [chitchatting and music] - If you could snap your fingers and have anything in the world, what would you have? - I dunno. - Racehorse? E-type Jag? Night out with Farrah Fawcett Majors? Villa in Majorca? - I don't want to buy a pension. - Seven and a half. - Nine! - I'll give you seven and three-quarters, tops. - She gave me a Christmas card. - Christmas card? Fuckin' hell, pal, you're in! - You reckon? - Gagging for it. See? Coming over, see? Hi, love. - Three and a half? - Mmmmm! And what about our friend here? - Still thinking about that one. - Sense of humour. Lovely quality in a lady, eh? Any idea what a loaf of bread's gonna cost you in 1999? - None whatsoever. - 8 pound, 32 new pennies. Been scientifically proven. - How much would that tie cost? - There it is again. Very droll. Got a live one here, eh, Vince? Here, love, listen... you take this. Now, that's me, all right? Come in useful, this will. Mark my words. Me and thee, next Friday night. May the force be with you. - Mmm, very useful! - Joanna! - Hi. - I've, uh, got something for you. - Oh. - A Christmas card. - It's the 7th of January. - Well, uh, think of it as early for next year. - Okay. Thanks. Vince? - Yeah? - Are you a virgin? - What? - Have you ever had sex? - I... I know what it means! And I have. So I am. I... mean, I'm not. I've, uh... I've got a girlfriend. - Really? What's her name? - E-Eliz-Elizabeth. - Like hers. Hmm. Coincidence. God save the queen. - Oh, right, but my Liz is much younger, though. Blond... brainy... brilliant. Bus stop. What? What'd you do that for? - E Street! [TV]: Hai Karate's 2nd fragrance, new Eastern Spice. Just one whiff... drives women wild. A sultry Oriental aroma makes men irresistible. That's why there's a special leaflet on self-defence in every pack. - Hi-ya! Hi...! [TV]: Hai Karate and Hai Karate Eastern Spice. Be careful how you use it... - Sorry I'm late! - Our food is getting cold, Joanna. - I'll be down in a minute. - Well, I'm sure you would've been here well before now if you'd considered the feelings of others. Ahem. Water? - Yes. - Someone around this table is going to die of lung cancer. - In case you didn't know, we're all going to die. Even you. Of course, but given the choice, most people would prefer to live a long life rather than a short one. - Yeah, but, Lucy, consider for a moment this: maybe we're missing the point. Maybe Joanna smokes not in spite of the dangers but because of them. Hmm? - Jesus Christ. - Joanna. - Actually, Lucy's, uh... written a poem that expresses our feelings. Something for you to reflect upon, Joanna. - Joanna is stupid in the way she acts She doesn't want to face the facts If she continues to smoke she will die Statistics prove it they don't lie Both visually and vocally She acts so anti-socially She makes us want to stand up and shout Heavens! Stop acting like a silly, silly lout! - God! Fuck off! - No, don't... - Fuck off? Fuck. - Lucy, I think maybe it's time you and I had a little chat-- - Peter, she's only nine. - She's precocious. Come. Sit down, Lucy. Now... the adult male body. In a few years' time, it's something you'll find yourself attracted to. And the focus of that attraction is... the penis. - When you're in a relationship. - Right. - A stable, loving partnership. - Mm. During the act of love-making, the penis will stiffen and grow considerably in size. - To what sort of dimensions? - When erect, anything between three and four-and-a-half inches. The penis will rise to an angle of between 90 and 155 degrees, the man then inserts the penis into the woman's vagina and leaves a deposit of sperm. The man then withdraws his penis, and that concludes the act of sex. - Is that it? - That's it. [singing] - Ray got his Norwegian gig. So me dad stepped in for the party at the home. - Mm, yeah? - It's gonna be a magic man. - Mum was off out with her friend Betty. As usual. So I thought I'd go along and give him some support. - 1 don't wanna go in the box! - You're going in. - I think he was a bit nervous. - You've been a lovely audience. I've been the Reverend Anthony Cooper. Now I want you to put your hands together and welcome the very special talent of Mr. Harold Smith. [applause] [piano playing] - Thank you, thank you. H-h-hello, everyone. Uh, very nice to here for Mrs. Battersby's 100th. Now, this is... - He kicked off with the mind-reading trick he did at Christmas. - ... if I'm not very good. It's no good, I'm getting a blank. [snoring] - But if his first trick didn't make much of an impression, his second was nothing short of breathtaking. - I shall, through nothing more than the power of thought, attempt to stop your watches. - Hey, now, this is good. Look at your watch. Go on. - Th-thank you, Madge. Thank you. The lovely Madge. Right. After three. One. Two. [all]: One. [newscaster]: And in local news, three pensioners died during a magic trick that went tragically wrong. Mr. Smith, a 55-year-old retired clerk, was making his first public performance... [2nd newscaster]: ... cut short by the sudden and mysterious deaths of three guests, during a performance by local entertainer Mr. Harold Smith. The spokesman said a thorough investigation is now underway and a number of witnesses are helping them with their inquiries. John North was at the scene earlier today. - Mum's seeing a lot of Betty recently. [newscaster]: ... at the 100th-birthday party... - Think of a number, Vince. Thirty-five. - Very good, Dad. - ... three of the party-goers mysteriously died, and while the party magician, a Mr. Harold Smith, was in the middle of his act. - Bloody Nora! [TV]: This is Hai Karate. And this unsuspecting girl... - How... how did you do that, Dad? [TV]: ... irresistible scent. - Hi-ya! - I really like this one. [TV]: ... can turn a usually docile woman into a ravenous creature. ... irresistible. But every pack of Hai Karate carries central instructions on self-defence. [clock ticking] - "Hello." "Howdy." [dring!] - Hello. Hello? [dring!] - Howdy. It's Vince. Well, it was the last time I looked. [snorting] God, I'm bored. I'm so bored, I think I'm going to have a coma. Anyway, I was thinking... [feedback] ... because I do occasionally, believe it or not, wondering if you'd fancy a spin down the Roxy tonight. I-l mean, hey, it might not be your scene, but I thought I'd call ‘cause I reckon Turd-Tache has got it in for me today. So, what do you say? [laughter] I reckon it could be pretty groovy. But... but if you're busy... If you're busy... [feedback] [laughter] Busy. [feedback] [laughter] Rrrr... [feedback and laughter] - A night down the Roxy with little Vincent Smith. Who'll start the bidding? [laughter] I am suddenly unavailable, personally, tonight, ‘cause I'm staying in to wash my turd-tache. [laughter] All right, trusty slaves, comedy interlude over. Back to the tedium of the working day. If you please. Good? - Nice speech. For Elizabeth, was it? - Who? - Your girlfriend, Queen Elizabeth. - Oh! Oh, Elizabeth. That's right. Great dancer. - Ah, that's a shame. I would love to have gone with you. - The people who write this filth should be locked away. - Locked away? Would you throw away the key? And if so, where? And would you have a duplicate made? In case you couldn't find-- - Oh, God! - Oh, please! - What's happening? Get away, you little tart! We're trying to discuss pornography! Yes, they're very nice, but I don't want them in my face! ["l Love to Love" by Tina Charles] I love to love... ... My baby just loves to dance The minute the band begins to swing it He's on his feet to dig it And dance the night away... Stop I'm spinning like a top We'll dance until we drop But if I have my way... - "Agent Smith, undercover. I'm under surveillance. "Will you kindly dance with me? Because if you dance solo, "suspicions may be aroused--" - And it might blow my cover. - It's a crock. - Get off! It's bloody magic. - Oh, here's a good one. "Do you go for happy, witty millionaires? "And if they say yeah, "you say 'In that case, may I buy you a drink?" "And if they say no, you say ‘Good, 'cause I'm none of them. "What're you drinking?' So either way, it works. - Yeah, with a line like that, pal, you can't lose. Now get in. [honking] ["Boogie Nights" by Heatwave] Oh, here she comes. Ladies. - Do you go for happy, witty millionaires? - Fuck off. - Agent Smith. Agent. Like, uh... Bond! James Bond. - Hey, 007, why don't you... sod off. - I'm in, mate! - What? - Nine and a half and a bloody cracker! She's had her tongue down me throat for the past hour! Come and have a look! - I later discovered me mum's friend, Betty, had moved to Canada. In 19689. So it wouldn't have been easy for me mum to see her every night. - You've met before? - The odd once or twice. Vince, wait! I can explain! - All right. Go on, then. - Got a nice bum. - Oh... well, that's all right, then. Isn't it? Walter and me mum. Me best mate and me mum. Bloody hell. You know, that was the last time I ever went to the Roxy. But the thing is, I really should've been grateful. Because if that hadn't happened, what happened next wouldn't have happened. And my life would've been completely different. - Everything is shit! [girl laughing] Everything fucking thing! [punk-rock music] Fucking fuck, wanker! - You know when you see someone and it's like, ping, they're the one. Your brain turns to jelly, your legs turn to blancmange, your heart is beating -- boom, boom, boom -- like it wants to jump out of your mouth and do a tango on the table. And you've got to have them, ‘cause it's like... destiny. - Bastards! - Yeah... bastards. ["Ever Fallen in Love" by the Buzzcocks] I am an anarchist.

A bit chilly, though. - What in the name of fuck is that? - It's a bit chilly. - It's a bit chilly. - Walking on the beaches, looking at the... peaches! Say cheese. - Seems like a nice bloke. So, in a few short days, me mum had got off with me best mate, I'd fallen in love with a punk girl and become a punk, and me dad had accidentally killed three pensioners. It seemed about time things got back to normal. But it wasn't to be. [TV]: In South York, today, police arrested a 55-year-old local trickster, Harold Smith, over the sudden deaths of three local pensioners. Eyewitnesses claim they fell from their chairs and died during a magic trick that went horribly wrong. Mr. Paul Trist, the manager of the old-people's home, who saw the act, said, "He wasn't very good." - All right, Mr. Smith, uh, I'm your lawyer, and this is Joanna, a very promising young clerk with our firm. She'll be making notes during the discussion for future reference. - Hello. - And, uh, Vince you know. - So you're his dad? - Joanna, no need to kick a man when he's down. Ah, well, let's get down to business. Three deaths and the finger of blame pointed at you. What's going on here? - Well, I-l think it's because I made them-- - Pacemakers. - I-I-l made them stop, with me mind. - Uh... well, yes, of course. But, uh, I mean, you didn't really, now did you? - Yes, I did. - No, you didn't. - Yes, I did. - No, you didn't. Because.... if you had, a law of nature would've been transgressed, the impossible would've occurred. Now, are you in the habit of making the impossible occur? - Well, I don't know if I'd put it like that. - Well, how would you put it? - Well, it all goes back a bit, you see. - Load us onto your magic carpet and transport us to the past. - Well, it started when I was just a kid, a little lad. I discovered I could make things move about, that sort of thing, just by thinking. I-l used to mess about with it, you know, do little tricks for me mates. And one of me mates, me best pal, Lenny, one day Lenny said did I want to go out for a day trip to Blackpool with his mum and his dad, who was the vicar. So I said, "Aye, why not." And, oh, it were a grand day. Do you know, I think it... I think it were the best day of me life. Yeah. Went on this... great big roller-coaster. Anyway, we-we got back to Lenny's house, vicarage, in time for his tea, and then his dad said he'd heard from Lenny that I were a bit of a one for the magic tricks and would I do a little turn for them. Lenny said, "Go on, Harold, make summat float.” So I said, uh, "All right.” - May we anticipate some point to this, uh, touching little tale? - No, I'm-'m... I'm getting to it. You-you see, Lenny had a tortoise. Knobby. Were it Louie? [sighing] No, no. Knobby. It-it was a lively little chap, Knobby, for a tortoise, nice, bright eyes. So, anyroad, I thought, I know what I'll do, I'll make Knobby float. So sat him down on the rug and everybody gathered round -- I don't know if Knobby were a bit nervous, because he nipped back into his shell -- but I got on with it. I looked at him and concentrated and I thought, Rise, Knobby. Rise. But, uh, it weren't coming easy. Well, I suppose a tortoise is, uh, a lot heavier than a pen, or a coin. Lenny's mum and dad were sitting there watching, and I could tell they were thinking, This lad is a couple of slices short of a loaf. So I really gave it some wallop. And it worked. Knobby started to rise. Up, up, up. You could've cut the air with a knife. He gets to about a foot, and I thought, I'll just hold him there, hovering. And just then, his little head popped out. He started looking around, as if to say, "Hey, what's going on here, then?" And his little arms and legs came out and started waggling about. Maybe I should've guessed, but, uh, anyway, then it happened. - What? - Knobby, like, well... exploded. Oh, dear. [laughing softly] Oh, dear. I mean, it could've been dangerous. Flying fragments of tortoise shell, it's like shrapnel. It could've taken someone's eye out. Fortunately, no one was hurt. Though I do believe an ornamental china duck copped it, but, oh, it was a right bloody mess. What a to-do. The very next day, Lenny stole my champion conker. Well, after that, I thought this magic stuff were more trouble than it were worth, so I stopped doing it. Until Mrs. Battersby's 100th, that is. - Hmm. Well... what a very quaint little tale, Mr. Smith, but, uh, well, it was... a lot of old nonsense, weren't it? - No, it wasn't. - Yes, it was. - No, it was not. - All right, fine. Mr. Miraculo... off you go. I'm going to... suggest to the police that they are holding you on grounds that are quite plainly absurd, and arrange a meeting with an expert witness, a man of science and reason to confirm this. In the meanwhile, we'll have you home by teatime. Good day, Mr. Smith. - God, your dad is amazing! - You think so? - Nonsense. He's a complete and utter charlatan. Exempt from the laws of nature? Joanna, isn't your father something of a... expert in such matters? - Oh, hello. Yes, I'd like to make an appointment with Dr. Bannister, please. - Hocus-pocus, or mumbo-jumbo? Can the humble conjuring trick really be harmful to your health? Well, it seems it might be if it's Mr. Harold Smith who's puling the rabbits out of the hat. Mr. Smith, seen here with the winning catch from the 1967 Don Valley angling competition, was today released from police custody pending tests to establish... [yawning] - Think I'll be having an early night. - Good night, then, love. - Tired, Harry? [TV]; Police claim that Smith willed the deaths of three pensioners during... - Oh, I see. Why not. I am, now you come to mention it, [yawning] I'm ready... I'm ready for bed meself. - It-it's only half-past-six. - Fame can be an exhausting business. Come on, Magic Man. I can make things rise and all. - Abracadabra indeed. That's it from the newsroom. Let's get the latest weather from Martin. - So what do you think? Three months? Six months? - Peter, it's not good. It's almost certain you'll never run seriously again. - Vincent, you all right, pal? I've not seen you around much. Not avoiding me, eh? - I'm into a new scene. - Oh, what's that? - I'm an anarchist. - What's that like, then? - All right. - Look, pal, I don't want a woman to come between us. - It wasn't a woman, it was me mum! - I never shagged her! - Shut up! - Was just snogging and feeling! - I don't want to know. How would you like it if I got off with your mum? - Swaps? It's a bloody deal. - Il didn't mean that. - No, no, Vince, nor did I. But you gotta help me, mate. ‘Cause you know when you see someone and it's like... ping, they're the one and your brain turns to jelly, and your legs turn to blancmange and your heart's beating like boom, boom, boom, like it wants to jump out your mouth and do a tango on the table and you've gotta have them. ‘cause it's... like destiny. You know what I mean. - Aye, I do. - It. Two. - I think you can do better than that, Joanna. - Actually... - Irritant. Double word. Seventy-eight. - So is your, uh... lady friend coming? - You what? - Nothing. - Oh. Well done. -Quatre-vingt-quinze. Your game, Mother. - I'm going out. - Fuck this! Woman!!! Woman!!! Woman!!! [banging] Ahhhhh!!! - Go away, Daz! Please, go! - "Go away, Daz. Please go." "Nasty, nasty, nasty..." Fuck, shit!! Fuck, pig, shit, nipples!!! - Your go, Margaret. Now. - Stop it. That's enough. Daz-- [Daz straining] Don't you dare! - Woman!!! - Don't you dare! [screaming] - Down, down, down, down. - Woman!!! - Now, now, please... [Lucy yelling and screaming] - My cello! - Woman!!! Woman!!! - Daz, get out now. - Ah! [Lucy screaming] - Daddy!!! - Woman!!! [Lucy screaming] - Police! There he is! - That's the punk. - Got the bastard. - No! Stop! - Come on. - Bloody hell. Now Joanna's dad had a black eye do go with his runner's groin. I suppose if you'd lined up Joanna and the punk girl, you'd've had to admit they looked similar. But it had never occurred to me that they were the same person. Sometimes, you just don't see something. Even when it's staring you in the face. - No, none of these. [TV]: So Peter Pringle and Gerry Giraffe, what can I say? Phenomenon, undoubtedly, but what sort of phenomenon and why? - Oh, he's looking at you, Roland! - He is, isn't he. I hope he's not going to nibble my knee - Giraffes like middle wickets. - Oh, cricket fan, is he?. - Succulent, tender middle wickets. - Ah, no. No, there are children watching! [chaos] Get him off! That's your hand and it's on my penis! - The big day had arrived. - Mr. Nesbitt had arranged for me dad to be tested by Joanna's dad. He was convinced that a series of carefully controlled tests in laboratory conditions, conducted by Dr. Peter Robinson, an unshakable man of science, would prove that Harold Smith was just a miserable fake. Well, that was the idea, anyway. - Shall we get cracking? - Right. [laughing] - Scissors. Tennis racquet. Cat. Policeman's helmet. Telephone box. Runner. Tortoise. Bus. Father Christmas? [bell ringing] - Incredible! Incredible! - Y-y-your favourite colour's green, your mother was blind... y-you don't like bananas... you're afraid of death. [Whatever Happened To" by The Buzzcocks] Whatever happened to All of the heroes - Yes! Whatever happened to The heroes Whatever happened to the heroes No more zeros anymore No more heroes anymore [Lulu]: Ahem. -Charlie's Angels' on television. About 50 minutes. - Don't be any longer, Miracle Man. - So, uh, what happened, then? Last night. - Oh, just... just this idiot I was seeing. - If he's such an idiot, why were you seeing him? - Probably because I'm one, a pathetic idiot, - But... but you're wrong! You're so wrong! You're not. An idiot, I mean. ‘Cause... you're not. [honking] [TV]: They say not only can he tell you what you're thinking, but he can even make things fly around the room. And has apparently cured this scientist fella, Peter Robinson. - Come here! - All right, Ray. How's was Norway? - Crap. Get in. [TV]: ... I don't know if he makes house calls. Well, it looks like the country is going Harold Smith crazy. What do you say, Arnold? [dog barking] I thought you would. - Is this a wind-up, or what? - No, no, it's true. He can really do it. - Hereditary. It must be hereditary. It's moving. - You're just wobbling the table. - Bastard! How's he bloody do it? - Peter, you all right? - Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Yes. [panting] No, actually. No. I'm more than all right. I am reborn. I want to confess my sins. - N-no. No, Peter. - Margaret. I have fornicated. In 1971... - Dad! - I had oral sex and full sexual intercourse with another woman. - Dad, shut up! - I met her at a Chicago symposium. [Margaret hyperventilating] Then I began an 18-month on-off affair-- - For chrissake! Da-Dad, shut up! - ... an on-off affair with Helen Stevens, [Margaret sobbing] who worked with me at the particle-acceleration unit! Sexual intercourse did not take place. [Margaret humming] Ejaculation, however, did. [sobbing] - What's for pudding? - Lucy, go pack. - I'm sure there's a perf-- - Pack your bags now!!! Upstairs! - I love you all so much. [TV]: And then in a move that stunned the scientific community, top scientist Dr. Peter Robinson dramatically resigned. -... that Harold Smith is a supernatural phenomenon. - They say he can read minds and make things fly, and bend spoons and even heal people. - He's not a hero, he's a murderer!! If you hear me, Harold Smith, you're a bloody murderer!! You got blood on your hands!! You're a... - Clairvoyant, or con man? Healer, or hustler? I don't know yet, but what I do know is that everyone I meet seems to want to get alongside Harold Smith. - Do you mind terribly, I'm I'm just having me tea. - Sorry. - Oh, we just... - Sorry. - Sorry. ... [radio]: ... and a tape from Derry by The Undertones. But first, here's a great treat: the unmistakable sound of The Clique and Raw Power [distantly]: Vince! [punk-rock music] [music stops] Vince! Vince!! Vince! Where is he? - Where's who? - Your dad! Bring him out. - Shhh! Quiet. You'll wake-- - Speak up, Vince! I can't hear you! - I said you'll wake the neighbours. - I think I'm gonna be sick. - Oh... Wait there. I'll bring you a glass of water. Or a cup of tea. - Sing me a song! -Eh? What song? -You pick. [softly]: White riot I wanna riot White riot A riot of my own White riot I wanna riot White riot A riot of my own - It's not really you, is it? - W-well, maybe I could just... I could-- - Why don't you just do something!!! - Do something? - Yes, do something!!! Bye, Vince. [typing] - ... after the dark came the light. - Dad? [typing] Dad? Dad, are you okay? - My report for your Mr. Nesbitt. Got to run. [dring!] - Teabag. Get that. [dring!] [dring!] - Daz, it's for you. It's Joanna. - What? [with "feminine" voice]: Is that you, sugar? - Who the fuck is that? - Just hold on there a minute... Popsy. - I said who the fuck is that?! Hello? Hello? Hello? Fuck you! [banging] [banging] Hello?! Hello?! - Oi. Say cheese. [Daz gasping] - Aaahhh! Ahhh! Ahhh! - Vince, me foot's stuck. Aaaaaaahhhhhh!!! - Pull it out! [screaming and yelling] - Drive! -"l now see "I were a man staggering through the driest desert "on a barren planet in an endlessly empty, "meaningless and dying universe. "And then, by a series of miracles" -- no less -- "the scales fell from my eyes "and I awoke in a garden "and everything is beautiful.” Dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. Seems that your father is a raving, bloody lunatic, doesn't it? Eh? And a lesson to us all -- [over intercom]: how weak the human heart and mind. So you must be grateful that as the year 2000 hoves into view, our dependence upon such frailties will very shortly be vastly diminished. And the battle betwixt mind and machine, the machine is destined always to emerge victorious. There's nothing you, I, nor anybody else can do about it. - No? - Well, no. Um... What are you doing? [crash!] - One up for humans, Turd-Tache! [applause] [cheering] - Joanna. Where you going? What're you doing? - Wh-wh-what are you doing? - Oh, I think it fell out the window. - I threw it out. - Smith! Bring it in! - I'm leaving. I've quit. - No, you're fired! - No, you're fired, I quit! -And sodo I! - Smith! Get back here! Get back here! That's a very expensive piece of equipment! And you can't quit, you're fired! Do you hear me? Both of you, fired! - What? Back down south? - Why stay here? Oh! - I did something. - What? - You know, "Do something!" I did something. Cut off his hair. Daz. - What? You cut off Daz's hair? Why? Bye, Vince. - Stop. Don't go. But I didn't say that. And she left. Meanwhile, Joanna's dad continued his mission to tell the whole world about Harold Smith. So he went to the police. Sergeant Tom Higgins, 35 years in the force, was all too keen to listen. Mr. Nesbitt's plan to test me dad and prove he was a fake had backfired completely. According to Joanna's dad, Harold Smith did indeed have special magic powers, and he'd used them that fateful day at Mrs. Battersby's 100th. Sergeant Higgins knew it all added up to one thing and one thing only: - Murder. Sure as if you'd struck those poor, unfortunate souls down with your own hand. And we've the word of a distinguished man of science to prove it. - Officer, a brief, private word with my client, please? Admit it. Admit you conned them, admit you've been conning everybody. - Well, you see-- - It's just... it's just a lot of bloody jiggery-pokery, isn't it? A lot of rabbit-out-of-the-hat nonsense. Look, just-- See sense. Deny these absurd claims, and the whole case collapses. - Not sure I can do that. - Why? - It wouldn't be true, would it? It's in the lining of your jacket. - What is? - The silver fountain pen you're looking for. It slipped down. - Mr. Smith, do you want to spend the next 15 years of your life alone in a 10-foot-by-8-foot prison cell, eh? - Would it have a television? [music] - Carnage in a nursing home. Uproar in the halls of learning. And a local man at the centre of the storm. Today, in a Thornton Tonight special, we ask, "Who is Harold Smith?" And in the studio, to help us answer that question, senior solicitor Keith Nesbitt, founder member of Nesbitt Solo; Dr, Peter Robinson, leading academic, physicist, and author of Zero Numbers and Empty Spaces, an ontol... an ontol...? - An ontology. - Harold Smith Jr., Harold Smith's eldest son... - That's our Ray! - ... shortly be performing... - Cheeky bugger. -... with his father at Blackpool Winter Gardens. - Book early. - First I've heard about it. [ding-dong!] - ... thanks to the miracle of modern technology, live, the man himself, Harold Smith! - Harold Smith? - Hi. - Come on, lads. Let's go. - Vince, that's our hallway! - So, Mr. Smith... Welcome. Now -- ahem -- let's begin. - My son Vince. - Hello. Hello. Hello. - Hi. - Who is the real Harold Smith? - Uh, may... may I interrupt here and say that my client has no comment. - I see. Dr. Robinson, you are a man of rationality, a man of science. You've seen what this man is capable of. Asses him for us. - He's a bloody genius. Uh, well, I think that most religions speak, don't they, of a second coming. - Mr. Smith, a second coming? - Please, please, does this man look like the new messiah? - Actually, he did have a beard when he were younger. - He did, yeah. - It's so typical of our age that we expect our messiah to ride in looking ever inch the part. Long hair, flowing robe, like some Hollywood film star with "Jesus" stamped on his forehead like a date stamp on a... on a tin of beans. Ah-ha-ha-ha... But you see, that's not how he came last time. No. That's why they crucified him, you see? Because they couldn't accept him for who he was -- The son of God! - I see. And is this son of God to suffer the same fate as the last? - My client would like to deny categorically that he is the son of God. He's in fact the son of Barry and Elsie Smith. - Oh, no, no. No, you see, I have seen proof. I've experienced miracles. - Oh. - Right. Well, I think it's time to spring the surprise. Hugh. - Right here, Roland. - Prepared by his lawyer, Mr. Nesbitt, this glass, sealed tube houses the finest A-grade quarter inch Sheffield steel nail. - Bend it. - Go on, Dad. - Go on, love, go on. - Uh, Harold... Harold, listen to me, uh, listen to me, Harold. Harold, yes, it's repugnant. Yes, it's obscene, but if the circus wants it, perhaps it's the only way they'll understand. Do it! Do it! [several]: Go on now. Go on... -l can't. [several]: What? What? ... - Can't? - There were no miracles. It were all nothing more than kiddies' conjuring tricks. - No, no, no, no, no. This is... this is not possible. - You cheating bastard. - Bingo! - Get out of my way. Move it... - Mr. Smith, why? - Well, uh, um... You know, I-I-l just... I just wanted to try something a little bit different. I'm sorry if I've upset anyone. - You what?! - Okay, stay with him. - You useless wanker! - Thank you, Harold Smith Jr. - No. Harold, Harold, I know why you're doing this-- - Thank you, Dr. Peter Robinson. - Don't... You don't have to. - Wrap it up... - Harold, don't, don't be forced into this. [iumble of voices] - Please get this bearded Jesus freak off my set. Get off, get off. [chaos] [TV]: ... very sorry. We seem to have lost our Thornton Tonight special. I do apologize... - You all right? - Aye. - Funny business, eh? - Sometimes, Vince, you've got to try a bit harder, go a bit further. Say, "Bugger, you lot. This time, it's my turn.” Do you know what I mean? - No. [both laughing] - She's leaving tonight for good. But she's gonna say one last goodbye to her friends. Big concert. Could be your lucky night. - One, two, three, four! [punk-rock music] - Now I was really going for it. The full-on punk gear. I was not going to take no for an answer. [music] It's me! - Piss off! [music fading] - So that was it, then. "Piss off." That'd be the last words Joanna would ever say to me. The next day, she'd be gone for good. Bugger. [music picking up] Sod it. Think about it -- when you've hit rock bottom, things can only look up. Can't they? - A bit chilly. Say fucking cheese! - Go on. Go on! Get him, Daz! - You know how it is when you look back and you don't know if something was a dream, or you just imagined it... or it really happened? Well, what happened next was like that. Just like that. - Stop. He's my son. - So join the fucking party! - Run!! [sound fading and distorting] - Oi, what's happening? [booing] What's going on? - Oh, fuck off! - Sometimes, you've got to try a bit harder, go a bit further. Say "Bugger, you lot. This time, it's my turn.” Suddenly, it all made perfect sense. This was going to be my lucky night. Ah, bloody yes! ["Saturday Night Fever” starting] The Fever. [whistling] [cheering] [wild cheering] - What's wrong? - I can't... I can't move. Four cracked ribs, a broken collar bone, and an arm bust in three places. And it didn't hurt a bit. [Joanna laughing] In fact, the most uncomfortable feeling about the whole episode was one of embarrassment. [Joanna laughing] Well, there you have it. And we all lived happily ever after. Sometimes, people ask me about me dad. "Whatever happened to Harold Smith?" Well, Harold Smith lived a long and happy life, and passed away peacefully in his favourite chair. But I know he's up there somewhere, and he's looking out for us. And he's got his pipe and his telly, and he's just fine. Thanks, Dad. Captioning by CNST, Montreal
