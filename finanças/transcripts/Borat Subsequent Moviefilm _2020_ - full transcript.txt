[ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYING] [WOMEN SINGING TRADITIONAL SONG IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [CHORUS SINGING MELANCHOLY SONG IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] BORAT: Jangshemash. My name a Borat. My life is nice. Not. But how I end up like this? 14 year ago, I release a moviefilm which was great success in US&A. But Kazakhstan become a laughingstocks around the world. Our exports of potassium and pubis plummet. Many brokers leapt from our tallest skyscrapers. [GRUNTS] Since Running of Jew had been canceled, all Kazakhstan had left was Holocaust Remembrance Day, where we commemorate our heroic soldiers - who ran the camps. - [DANCE MUSIC PLAYING] I was blamed for Kazakhstan's failure and banned from ever make reportings again.

This led to other Africans becoming political leaders. But then a miracle occurred. A magnificent new premier name McDonald Trump rose to power and made America great again. He also became buddies with tough-guy leaders across the world: Putin, Kim Jong-un, Bolsonaro and Kenneth West. Everyone apart from me. You, Sagdiyev... will return to US&A to deliver a gift so that Kazakhstan will earn the respect of Trump.

JEANISE: "Then suck all of her insides... ...where she remains to this day." TUTAR: Yes. This is not a true story. - Okay? - It is a true story. No, no, it's not a true story.

I mean, I understand what you're saying, - that your daddy told you that. - Yes. But that's not the real world. - Are you touch your vagine? - Who, me? - Yes. - Have I ever touched it? - Yes. - Yes. - No. - Yes. - You can't touch your... - And I-- Yes, and I'm here.

I will get the surgery so my daddy can give me as a present for this American man. What kind of surgery? I will have the biggest titties in the whole world. Okay, so you're getting plastic surgery at 15. Yes. - When you getting that done? - Now. - Now? - Yes. Well, do you want that? Seriously. No, you don't, 'cause you would've said yes. I excite. You excite, but that's not what you want. Okay, I don't think you need to do that. 'Cause you're pretty and you're young. And any man should like you as you are. You shouldn't want to be anybody else but yourself. But if I have enormous titties, I don't have to learn how to swim. Your-your titties will not keep you from drowning. You will still have to learn how to swim. They will protect me. How will they protect you? They titties. Titties are not gonna keep you out the water. You are pretty. You're a pretty-- Girl, look at yourself. Look. Look. You see yourself? Huh? [CHUCKLES] Yes, you are beautiful. So I don't see anything on your body or on your face that need to change. I want you to be happy. But I wish you would just think about some of the stuff I said. Think about going to school. Use your brain, 'cause your daddy is a liar, okay? My daddy's the smartest person in the whole flat world. [CLICKS TONGUE] Mm, I can't, I can't say nothing about that, but you got a big brain up there, so use it. Just think. 'Cause I don't think you need to change. I will think about it. Hey, that's all I want. That's all I want. I want you to think about it. That's all I want for you, just to think about it.

A-A lot. Hmm. [EXHALES SHARPLY] [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] [CHORUS SINGING BRIGHT OPERA MUSIC] We-We've seen a dramatic drop in having children produced within wedlock.

Uh, it's something we don't talk about in p-public. Because of the Nadia Akatov story? No, no, no, no. If that is a lie, what other lies my daddy tell me? So come with me. Come with me. Let's run away from our daddies. Let's go and put our hands together and touch our vagines. And we're so glad you're here. Thank you. [APPLAUSE] WOMAN: Someone call her an Uber. [♪♪♪] Tutar! Tutar. Tutar. You went to the wrong address! It's over there. - I did not. - Come on. It's titty time. - No, I'm not doing it. - Why not? Because I'm beautiful as I am, and I don't need to be given as a gift to a man to be worth something. Yes, you do. It says so in the book. The Nadia Akatov story is a lie. - Not a lie. It true. - It is a lie. - I did it. - What? How did you escape? Out of your asshole? No. And the rest of the book is also a lie. Look there. It's a woman driving a car. BORAT: That is not a woman. That is Dog the Bounty Hunter. [SIGHS] This manual is full of lies. I found a new book which only tells the truth. It's called Facebook. I learn so many facts there. Like our nation's proudest moment, the Holocaust, never happened. - How dare you say that? - Look. [QUIETLY] No. [♪♪♪] See? - I'm leaving. - No, you don't. Wh-Who will lock your cage at night?

Everyone you know! You will never understand anything! I understand everything! You want this book? - Hey! - Take it. I hate it. And I hate you. And I will never see you again.

[PANTING] My mission had fail, and I had learned that the Holocaust was nothing but a fairy tale. Rather than return to Kazakhstan to be execute, I decide to take my own life. Since I did not have money to buy a gun, I went to the nearest synagogue to wait for the next mass shooting, disguised as a typical Jew. [♪♪♪] - Hello. - BORAT: Uh, Jang-shalom. Are you Jew? Yeah, I'm Jewish, yeah. Very nice weather, uh, we have been controlling. You are Jewish? Um... y-yes. No, you are not Jewish. Listen, don't-don't be afraid of me. But please don't eat me alive. Uh, do I look like I eat people? - Uh... - I'm a old, good woman. Yes. - Look at me. I'm Jewish. - Yeah. Do I have a long nose? - Look at me. - No. You can touch my nose. - What? - Look at me. You see? Is it long? - No, it's a small one. - Exactly like yours. Look at Doris. Does she have a long nose? BORAT: A little bit bigger than yours. So we are normal, exactly like you. Okay, then, use your venom on me and finish me. I have-- I am very depress. Can I give you a hug? - Don't-don't. - Don't kill me. I will not kill you. Let me give you a kiss. [WAILING] You see?

I'm hungry. - You are hungry? - Yes. - Good, huh? - Very good. - Very good, huh? - Mmm. I want to hear your story, my dear. This is the worst story that ever happened to any human being... or Jew. I came here on a simple mission to save my country by delivering our number one televiski star Johnny the Monkey as a gift to Michael Pence. And I'm sure you've figured out what happen next. My daughter had smuggled herself into the crate, and yes, you got it, she'd eaten the monkey. Although I believe he probably eat himself. There are bad stories out there. Listen, you want to hear my story, - when I was a little child? - Yes, what is your story? I was in the Holocaust. You see me? I was in the Holocaust. - The Holocaust? You were in the... - Yeah. - I was... - But the Hol-- the Holocaust never happen. But I saw it with my own eyes. So the Holocaust... - Happened. - ...happen? - Yes. - Really? - Really. - It was not a fake? - No. No, my dear. - [CHUCKLES] - It wa-- it really happened. - [SIGHS] Thank you, Judith.

You used me to spread the virus around the world. Yes I did. And our plan worked brilliantly. We got our revenge on the world for them laughing on us. Did you hear that, Brian? - Yes, sir. - If anything happens to me, forward this to my best boyfriends, Jim and Jerry. What is that magical calculator? It's called a phone. Who is that? America's Minister of Technology. His name, Brian. His twin brother live inside my phone. Say jangshemash, Brian. BRIAN: Hello. This is Brian. I just recorded you talking. Ok... What do you two want... to keep your mouths shut? I have some ideas. [♪♪♪] Jangshemash! Kazakhstan now feminist nation. Like US&A and Saudi Arabia. Bride exports declared misogynist, so we now traffic grooms. We use my iPhone 4's hot spot and steal password from assholes Uzbekistan. Now we are part of the global community, influencing elections around the world. Kazakhstan now center of COVID-safe fashion. We invent the maskini! ♪ Where did you come from? Where did you go? ♪ ♪ Where did you come from, Cotton-Eyed Joe? ♪ BORAT: Our people are kept healthy with daily hygienic temperature checks. Our fatality rate plummet to 92%. Best of all, I am reinstate as number-four journalist in all of Kazakhstan. Who number three? Tutar Sagdiyev. Why not? May the patriarchy go to hells. - Nice. - No, "ni-i-ice." Don't mansplain to me. Feminists. My visit to US&A make me realize that greatest threat to Kazakhstan is no longer the Jew. It is, in fact, the Yankee. - Jangshemash. - [CROWD CHEERING] Welcome to the first ever Running of the American. They're starting to run! Here comes the American! Oh no! He's got the fever! He's not wearing a mask. BORAT & TUTAR: Oh! - [BORAT SPEAKING KAZAKH] - [CROWD BOOING] Here comes Karen! She's being a little bit racist! She's going to cough. [ALL GROANING] Here comes the chief medical expert! - [CHEERING] - And he's got a vaccine! Everybody's going to be saved! Uh oh She's been to Walmart, she's got her AR-15. - [CROWD BOOING] - Karen is not happy. Oh no, she's killed Fauci! The Americans are victorious in their battle against science.
