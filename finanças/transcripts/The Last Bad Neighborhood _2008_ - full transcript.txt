(crowd cheering) Here we are again. Another year come and gone. (crowd cheers) The city grows, the Shinies push, but still, we stand. (crowd cheering) Here we are, and here we stay! (crowd cheers) We are the blessed ones. (crowd cheers) Having made the choice to be free men and free women. (crowd cheers) We are the artists, the criminals, the individuals that the Shinies couldn't be. So they hate us. (crowd booing) That's okay. It's okay. We wouldn't have it any other way. 'Cause we don't like them either! (crowd cheers) (motorcycles revving) Now, as free men and free women, we celebrate with the ceremonial running of the bikes. Rejoicing in life. As the Shinies could only dream of. Good people! Start your engines! (crowd cheering) (motorcycles revving) (rock music) - [News Reporter] Criminals celebrating their debauchery, the waste of society polluting their already fouled streets with the poison and waste that is their lives. - Can you believe that shit? That area is worth millions, and that's how they choose to use it? I built this city, I made it clean and safe. They dare defy my change. - Nothin' lasts forever. - Yeah. Change is slow. It takes time for the infestation to gestate and grow. But before they know it, everything they have will be replaced by what I give 'em, and they'll thank me for it. (suspenseful music) - Good speech today, bishop. - It was a good time. I hope you enjoyed yourself. - Business was a bit slow on Hockstreet but, not too disappointed. - It'll pick up. It always does. - Thanks for seein' me, Bishop. Lacey. I gotta problem with Ralph. You know, Dirty Ralph? He used two of my girls for a party. Didn't offer no recompense. I go to him, I try to settle it all friendly like. That bum tells me they workin' on they own time. I hate to take money outta my girls' mouths. Those are my girls, but I ain't runnin' no charity. So I send Snake over to talk with him. Dirty Ralph's boys bust him up all to hell. That point I figure talkin' to you is better than startin' a war. - You did right. I'll talk to Dirty Ralph and see what he has to say. We'll get this thing straightened out. - I appreciate that, Bishop. - Why I'm here. (footsteps walking) - Greetings, Bishop, thanks for takin' the time to see us. - Yeah, great to be here. - What's with you two? Even on this day, you gotta be hard asses? What? Huh? What the fuck is the problem now? - The same simple shit. This jackass keeps tryin' to push his business over on Hill. - Hey, part of Hill is mine. Mine, mother fucker. I can't help it if you and your idiot crew can't tell what the boundaries are. - [Man] Hey, Maggie's Place is the border, you gremlin fuck. - Hey. If he wants to wander up the hill, then he's gonna have to pay, simple as that. It's not simple enough for you, mother fucker? - Enough! Jesus fuckin' Christ. You guys are a pain in my balls. Money ain't gonna solve this. - Yeah, but they crossed over the line. - Don't open that nasty yaphole again, until I fuckin' say so. - Well. - You two lucky cocksuckers are gettin' a break, 'cause I'm in a good fuckin' mood. Here we go. Two men, non mortal combat, winner expands his territories. Naw, you know what? Let that whelp do this. He's so fuckin' hungry for a fight. - Hey. He's strong but he's slow. He's gonna go for your eyes, try and blind you, okay? - You two gonna kiss, or are we gonna get this over with? (techno music) - Want some? (grunting and punching) (techno music) (grunting and punching) (techno music) - Focus. (techno music) (grunting and punching) (screams) - You lose Upper Russell all the way to Maggie's Place, you dumb, homicidal, animal brained fuck. Next time you pull a knife without my say so, I'll make you use it to eat your family, do you understand me? Do you understand me! (yells) - yeah. - Stupid fucker. I think we may have to kill that man. (footsteps walking) Your boy did good. Tell him to keep his mouth shut next time though. (footsteps walking) You're bleedin'. - It's just a scratch. - Scratch, my ass. - I've had worse. - Go see Jaime and have him take care of that for ya. - All right. - And stop bleedin' on my floor. - You guys are so tough. Feel no pain and all that macho stuff. - We're soldiers. - Not you. You're king. - King is only as strong as the man who protects him. - Since when do you need someone else to fight your battles? - Since my back gave out, my knees got weak, and I can only fuck half as often. - Those young girls wear you out, old man? - Yeah. But I need to keep up appearances. They'd be so disappointed if I failed to please. - Just remember, king of mine, that I need you here. So stay healthy. - You want me healthy? Go check on Mack for me and make sure Jamie's takin' care of him. (footsteps walking) (suspenseful music) - I got drugs that'll help with the pain. - I'll be okay. Just do it. (laughs) - Your choice, tough guy. (belches) - Hey Lacey. - Bishop wanted me to check up on you. Make sure you're okay. - Tell mom I'll be fine, and all that worrying's gonna give him wrinkles. - You know him, he cares about you. - Yeah, good help is hard to fine. (coughing) - Exactly. - Drugs? - Nah. (laughing) - See you around. - So, you're good? - Yeah, I'm good. - Good enough to do something for me? - And what's that? - A few errands. - Oh, is that all? What do ya got? - Nothing too big. Pick ups and kick outs. - What happened to Holiday Amnesty? - That's exactly why it needs to be done now, when everyone's out of hiding. - All right. (suspenseful music) (traffic running) (hillbilly music) - Oh, I think that's three in a row. Think you better call it quit there, champ. - You talk a lot of shit, for someone that ain't much bigger than this stick. - That ain't talkin' shit. That's me kickin' your ass. Now pay up. - That's funny. You know, I don't see no Romero or none of your buddies around here. I heard you beat down that whale slag earlier, and I bet you're ridin' pretty high on yourself, so I'm gonna cut you some slack. Why don't you beat it, and call it a lucky day, huh? - Why don't you pay up, so you don't have to join that whale down at the clinic? - [Man] Hey Mack. - What's the deal, boys? You guys aren't playin' for money, are ya? I hate to tick off Bishop. - Man, Bishop can wipe his ass with what we got goin' on here. Besides, we were just about to settle up, call it a day, weren't we? (pool stick bounces) - Just can't get away from you today, huh? - It must be your good fortune. - Well just play it smart, huh? Don't change. (motorcycles running) - Thank you. I mean, it's just ... It's perfect. Do you see the river is just down there. The (mumbles) is spectacular. (laughing) They don't make it like this anymore. - [Man] I know, it's those ceilings. - Hey. They're kinda cute. Can I keep 'em? (suspenseful music) (footsteps walking) - Hey. Can we help you? - I was just gonna ask you the same thing. - Well then, I think we're doing just fine. Thank you. - Good, good. 'Cause I love people doing fine in my neighborhood. - Must be the welcoming committee. - Yeah. Somethin' like that. Before we welcome people, we like to know just what the fuck it is they're doin' in our little hood. - If you really must know. We represent the Global Coffee Company. - Represent 'em for what? - What do you think? - I think we got the Quick and Dirty around the corner, we don't need no Global Coffee Company. - Hey look, we have no interest in your quaint, local establishment. We just believe in offering a choice. - Oh, well, good. 'Cause we love choice in this neighborhood, don't we, Saxon? - Hell, options is my middle name. - It is. Since you guys are so damn swell bringing us this great new choice, I'm gonna return the favor. Now we can either fuck you two up, you can drive outta here, or we can fuck up your little car there, and you can walk. - That's our boss's car. And then he kicked me. - Look, they said that it was their neighborhood, and they didn't want any Shinies messing it up. - They don't want us messing it up? Hell, I'm trying to clean it up. Give people a decent place to live. Not that any of 'em could afford it. (chuckling) - There were some lewd epithets scratched into the paint of the car, sir. - All right. Fuck the slow infestation. I want Dockland. I want that waterfront property with its scenic views, and quaint fucking architecture. And I want control of the docks. Bishop's had a stranglehold on it for too long. If we get him out, the rest will fall. Get out! Get some men. Get some good men. I want Bishop done. And keep it quiet, no guns. If the police are worse, the media find out there was gunplay, they'd have to interfere. - You control the cops. You control the media. - Yes. But if enough of the concerned citizenry get disturbed, then it'll force some hands. No, let's keep this on a smaller scale. Make it look like one of the gangs did it, tryin' to take over. So natural. Vermin always want more, do it. - I'll see to it personally. - No, you won't. Too connected to me, you moron. I gotta stay clear of this. No, get some men that won't fuck this up. And make it look like gang shit, not a hit. I want that place in turmoil. Silverstone's Shipping and Storage. Get that for me, will ya? - You got it, boss. (phone beeping) - [Secretary] Dr. Franco's here to see you. - Hey. You gotta work? - Mm hm. - I thought it was a holiday. - No. - Jesus, Mack. - It's just a scratch. - I wish you'd let me stitch you up instead of Bishop's pet butcher. You're gonna be nothing but scar tissue soon. - Now we'll see how much sparkling personality. - You are charming. - Well, mama always said I was an ugly boy.

Best god damn hand I had all night, and these guys were takin' the bait. - Think it's a smart move, huh? Gambling when you owe the Bishop big money? - I was makin' money here. You gots to make money to pay money, or didn't you know that? - Look at me. - Yeah, so what? I've seen your ugly mug before. (laughing) - Haven't been makin' your payments in weeks now, Fresno. No one's seen ya around. Got me thinkin', maybe', you skipped town. Tryin' to run out on the money you owe. - I've been workin', man. Time just got away from me is all. You know how it is. (grunts) - No, I don't know how it is. I don't gamble every fuckin' thing that I touch. - You met my cousins, Mack? They're in town visiting. - You know this is only gonna make things worse for you. - Why are you bustin' my balls on Party Day, huh? You deserve a beatin' for breakin' the amnesty.

You havin' fun? - Just tryin' to clean myself up, you know? Listen, got any cash? I'm flat. - I'm sorry. - Nothin' free, you know? I'll give you the best blow job you ever had. I'll make you feel real good. - You know, my girlfriend tends to frown on other girl's lips on my dick, but thanks. - She doesn't have to know. - Women always know. - You still seein' that doctor? - [Mack] Mm hm. - Listen, you got anything just to get me through the night? You know ... - I'm sorry, baby, I don't get it. - But you gotta whole wad of cash. - Not my money. You know how it is. - I just wanted some food and a place to crash is all. - All right. If you head down to Specter's, and you tell him to give you somethin' to eat. Tell him I said so, okay? All right? - Yeah. - Cool, all right, yeah.

Hey Mack. - Hey girl. - [Vera] Come on in. (dogs barking outside) - You know what tomorrow is, right Vera? - Yeah, I know. I've been workin' really hard, Mack. I've got money comin' in now, so ... I can give you a couple bucks today. - How much? - Um, not much, you know, maybe 50? But I can have ... I can have a couple hundred by the end of next week. - Doesn't even pay this month's rent, Vera. You're already three behind. - I'm tryin' really hard, Mack. Jimmy got really sick last week. So ... - I know. Alex told me. - Yeah, so you know I'm gonna get back on track. - No more time, Vera. The man says you have to be gone by tomorrow morning. - Can't you talk to him, Mack? - [Mack] There's nothin' I can do. - Dammit, it's only money, Mack. I have a baby! Where am I gonna go, Mack? I got no place to go. - I know. I'll give you until tomorrow at noon. Nobody's gonna come by here until then, all right? It's the best I can do. I'm sorry. (melancholic music) - How you feeling, Mr. Stanton? - I was feeling so sharp. - Hi. - What the hell are you doin' here? - What do you think? I'm eatin' your dinner. - At least I had some company. Even if it is just my deadbeat little brother. - Excuse me, deadbeat? - [Alex] Mm hm. - I'll have you know I worked very hard today, didn't I Mack? - Oh yeah. Regular working class hero. - I'm sure it's something I don't wanna hear about. - How was your day, honey? - Well, the nice thing about Party Day is it's mostly alcohol poisoning and stupid shit like that. No deep wounds or half dead kids being dragged in. God, this is a fucked up neighborhood. - Yeah, but at least we're still around people, you know? Not like those fuckin' Shinies. Did I tell you about those two suits that were gonna buy the old Carpenter Building? We took care of it, but the Bishop says he needs to see ya tonight. - Bishop know about those Shinies? - I think that's why he wants to see you. - What does he want you to do about it? - Nothin'. Probably just sit there and listen to him rant and rave about keeping our individuality. - Hey Mack. Seriously man, how'd I do today? - Good speed, but we're definitely gonna have to work on your power. You couldn't punch through a cobweb. - But ... - And you're gonna have to work on learning when to keep your mouth shut. Got it? - All right. Goodbye, sis. - Bye, thank you for the company. - Thank you for dinner. - Hey, you want some to take with you? - No, you'll probably just see me tomorrow anyway. Thanks Mack. - Why do you have to encourage him? - It's his world. I just try to help him get along in it. - Did I tell you my sister Annie called? She wants us to come visit. - When are you gonna go? - Us, jackass, she wants us to go. - I don't think it's that good of a time for me to take a break right now. - It's never a good time Mack, that's the problem. It's never just you and me. - It's always you and me, always. Hey. Remember when we took that road trip last year, huh? That was fun, huh? - That was over two years ago, and that was the last time you had anything close to a vacation. That was four days. You come home, we eat, sleep, make love, then you're always gone. I'm a doctor, Mack, and I'm not on call that much. - This is what I do. - No, a job is something you do. This is your life. It's all you do. And you won't even let me be a part of it, you just keep me on the outside, skating around you, while you never let me get close. - Look, I don't want you close. Not to this. This is ... It's just so ugly. I mean, I want you to stay clean, untouched by it. I need a place to come home to. - You don't come home. You escape. You don't have to do this, we could leave. I would go right now. - What am I gonna do, huh? I grew up here. This is all I know. - It's all you want to know. But you are smart, and you're capable. Dockland is poisoned, and everyone who stays here rots. You and I, we're no exception. I know you're scared. - I'm not scared. - What is it then? - Bishop's waiting. I gotta go. - Well just think about it. Every day doesn't have to be another scar. - All right. (sexy music) - Mm, sometimes I think this better than sex, Mack. All selfish and decadent. - Goals are fiber. - But not your goals. - [Mack] I do okay. - [Lacey] Do you? - Don't seem happy, Mack. Are ya happy? - Yeah, sure. - Okay. (snaps fingers) Got somethin' for me? - Yeah. - All there? - Next week. - We believe him? - Yeah, we believe him. - How 'bout that other thing? - It's done. - Any problems? - No, she'll be gone in the morning. - I meant for you. - What, from Vera? Come on. I don't think so. - Not from her, man. About her. - She's gone. What is this? What's with the two of you? - Hear about the coffee shop? - What, the Shinies down by Romero's? - Yeah. Pushin' harder every day. They're trying to buy our land. They're trying to take over our businesses. They got the money, they got the numbers. - Why would they want this shithole? - 'Cause they can't have it, man. 'Cause it's ours, and that drives 'em wild. They can't stand anything that's not like 'em. That's why it must be hard. We have to maintain order. This place was a wasteland. Nothin' but gangs fightin' over shit that didn't really exist. I brought it together, made the docks safe, which in turn, made 'em profitable. - Yeah, yeah, I've been by your side the whole time, man. Why the history lesson? - Well frankly, me and Lacey feel you've become a bit distant lately. Look, you do the job better than anybody, but your heart's not in it. - Jesus Christ, Bishop. I break bones and take money from people. Throw single mothers out in the street. How happy do you want me to be, huh? - Hey. It ain't fuckin' nice, but it is the way it needs to be. I'm the law, and you're my man. And you gotta believe there's a big fuckin' plan, and everything that you do is geared towards that plan, even the unpleasant shit. It's for the greater good, buddy. And I need you to understand that. Lacey, get us some drinks. - Look, I've always done what's needed to be done. - I know that. Hell, you and Lacey are the only two people in this shithole that I can trust. But you're more than my enforcer, man. You're my friend. Hell, you're my kid, man. So I need you to be okay with this. I know I got your wallet, but I want the heart too. - Jesus, man. What are you, gettin' all weepy on me, you big girl? - Just give me a big kiss. (laughing) I just miss ya is all. Remember the old days when we were just bangers like the rest of these losers? - Hell yeah, we used to tear it up. - Yeah. No one messed with us unless we forced 'em into it, we were fuckin' bad ass. - Yeah. And then you had to go and get a vision. - I grew up in this city. I watched things change around here. Turned into some, some damn clone of somehtin' else. I watched good people get thrown out into the street. Either because they lost their job, or their house, or they couldn't fuckin' afford the cost of living. So it was either make a stand, or be forced out. - And no one forces you out, right? - Fuckin' A bro. Hey, we still have some fun, don't we? - Yeah. It's a good to be king sorta thing, yeah. - Ain't this sweet. We've got ourselves a couple of girlfriends. Afraid your reign here is over, Bishop. - The man says you're just too much trouble. - [Bishop] Here, I'm the only man you need to worry about. (suspenseful music) - You wanna tell me where I can do business? I'm gonna do business right here, over your dead body. - Told you we shoulda killed that man. (suspenseful music) (punching and grunting) (exciting music) (grunting) (punching and grunting) (exciting music) - Mack! Mack! - Go get Alex. Get a doctor! - Don't. Don't let them win. Dockland's ours. (Lacey crying) (suspenseful music) - No! (glass breaks) (suspenseful music) - We have to move him. I can't do it by myself, Mack, you have to help me. - He's dead, Lacey. What's your fuckin' hurry? - No he's not. He can't be dead. - You and I oughta know a corpse when we see one. - They know. We'll lose Dockland. That's what Bishop was tryin' to tell us. What do you think will happen if all the gangs think Bishop's dead? There'll be chaos. They'll either go after each other, or they'll come after us. Then the Shinies can move in. - Let it go, Lacey. - I worked too hard for this. We all did. Bishop died for it. - People will find out, Lacey. - We have a new leader in place. Til then, everything's the same. Bishop's still alive. We could lose this all, over night. Just work with me a couple days, please. - All right. - Okay. First, we need to clean the body up. Then we can get help cleaning up the rest of this. Look, this one's still alive. - Good. We need him. I've got questions. (suspenseful music) (bell chiming) - Hey. - Hey. I was tryin' not to wake you. - It's okay. - I'll shower then. - Hm. (shower running) (melancholic music) - [Bishop] Here we are! Here we stay! (shower running) (dramatic music) - [Silverstone] Any news? - [Rollins] No, not yet. - They fucked it. I tried to keep this nice and tight, keep it clean. - Just give it some more time. - Get me the Short Man. - That makes it open. It'll be messy. - I want that puss sucker, Bishop, dead. I want all his men dead. I'm not gonna tolerate their blight on my city any longer. - What about the cops, the media? - This is my city. We do it the hard way. (suspenseful music) - [Man] Fuck you! Who the fuck do you think you are? Get the fuck outta here. (exciting music) (punching and grunting) - There's someone who'd like to meet you. - I'll meet with him as soon as I'm done. (punching and grunting) (glass breaking) (suspenseful music) You play with them too much. (suspenseful music) - So we have this shipment coming later this morning and, I have another one this afternoon. - Who collects the money for all that? - The dock master. He'll go over the inventory sheets, make a quick inspection, then collect the money. - And all this is on the level? - All above board and legal. That's why we keep the receipts in these books. - And where does the money for that go? - Maintenance and upkeep of the docks, employee salaries, you know. - And the rest? - You're asking if Bishop gets a cut? - I'm just asking how much. - Obviously, there aren't legal records for all the transactions. - I had no idea. - Sweet deal, huh? - So besides all of the gambling, drugs, protection, racketeering and prostitution ... - Bishop is also a legitimate businessman. - And all that money? - Bishop kept most of it. He did have to spend some. Keeping Dockland privately owned is not cheap. - Yeah, but why didn't he reinvest in the neighborhoods? I mean, he coulda made life so much better here for everybody. - (chuckles) After all this time, did you ever know him to do anything for anyone, unless he got paid? - Yeah, I did. - Somehow, someway, everybody pays the Bishop. He did make this a better place. He did work for the people. - Yeah, but at what price? - Don't you judge us, Mack. You handed over way too much fuckin' money not to know how much we had. - Yeah, I just never realized that Bishop was such a -- - Selfish asshole? - Businessman. - It wasn't all Bishop. He was a warrior. A leader. I ran the books and most of the numbers. I'm more than a pretty face and a great lay. Why do you think he kept me around for so long? - He loved you. Didn't you love him? - He was a good man. He took good care of me. We did have some fun. Jesus, Mack, we have to be careful now. You're the face now. The people know you. Fear you. Respect you. You're a good man. Probably a better man than Bishop was, they'll follow you. - I'm no leader. That's your gig, not mine. - How many of these idiot macho fucks will follow a woman? Everything we've built. You, me, Bishop, we'll lose it. Then the Shinies move in. They'll take it, everything. We'll be on the street. You wanna help the people, it's who you are. But you're also hard enough not to let them walk all over you. Don't worry about the business end, that's what you have me for. That, and anything else you might want me for. - What about Bishop? - That's what I'm saying.

Money, the streets, the life, everything. - How are you gonna do that? - Let's just say I could. - But that would mean changing everything around. The gangs, the crime, payoffs. Hell, you'd be out of a job. - Yeah. - Dockland isn't gonna change, Mack. That's why I want us to leave. But, I'm not gonna nag you anymore, for now.

There seems to be a guiding force down there. - Bishop. - Yeah, Bishop. He and his gangs keep that property value low so they can keep the title to themselves. Now if he's gone, the gangs start infighting, violence reigns, and there's nobody left mindin' the store. I tried buyin' him out, I tried buyin' out around him. He keeps a tight grip. I even sent in some of my own guys, and never heard from 'em again. - You seem terribly upset. - Devastated. - So what it is that you'd have us do? - Make him come to you. Don't fight him on his own turf. - Pick a fight. - And I know just the place. (suspenseful music) - We're looking for Bishop. - Oh, are you two lookin' for your daddy? - Shit, I'd be willin' to be her daddy. (blood spatters) - Anybody else wanna be my daddy? - Take 'em! (exciting music) (punching and hitting) (heavy breathing) (grunts) - Ow. - Sorry. - Sorry your lunch got ruined. - Sorry your bar got ruined. Christ, Mack, you look like you got beat with a sack of rocks. - All I asked was that they avoid my face. - Maybe they'd pound some sense into it. - Doubt it. - Jesus. Get a gurney! Saxon? - Hey Alex. Down by the Quick and dirty. They're killin' us. - Don't talk, baby. Lay still. Just relax, I'm gonna take care of you. (car tires screech) - Romero. - Bishop. They're lookin' for Bishop. - Who did this? - There was two of 'em. A girl and a short guy. - A short guy? - Yeah. (tires screeching) - [Mack] Lacey! - You're not Bishop. - Who sent you? - It doesn't matter. - We're here. - Yeah? Well, you're not leaving. - Are you gonna keep us? - We're looking for Bishop. - You got me. - Lucky us. - You must be the Enforcer. - You must be The Short Man. - I am, this is my compatriot, Stil. - Heard you worked alone. - It is a lost man cannot find change. - Besides, who wouldn't want me. - [Lacey] I don't want you. - That's not nice. - I'm not nice. - So, Bishop's gonna let the hired help and his bitch do his fighting for him? - Who's the hired help here? I only see you. (exciting music) (grunts) (crying) (exciting music) (crying) (grunting) (punching) (suspenseful music) (grunting) (punching) (yells) (punching) (grunting) - That was entertaining. I wish I could tell you that I'd let you go, if you just gave me Bishop. - But we both know that wouldn't happen. - Ah! (kicking) (grunting) (exciting music) (kicking) (grunting) (punching) (grunting) (punching) (grunting) (people yelling) - Wait. My fight. (punching) (grunting) (exciting music) Wait. Let him go. - What the hell is going on? - They're leaving. - Well, stop him. - No. - He killed my brother. - I know. - Oh, hell no. - You killed him, you bastards! - No. You know this isn't over. - I know. - Let him go. Let him go! (Alex crying) (punching) Anything? - He's a tough one. He doesn't wanna say who his boss is. - Maybe I should ask. - Fuck you. - Let me try. I'm a doctor. I know where it hurts. (man screaming) - [Man] Okay! Okay! Okay! - I know how we can get to him. (exciting music) (bells chiming) - [Mack] Death is nothing new to us. We are no strangers to pain. The man we knew as the Bishop has fallen. A great man, who believed that we were better because we were our own people. Because we could dream, and we stand united by his loss. He was our leader, our protector, and my friend. So we honor him with a 21 bike salute. (motorcycles revving) - It's been almost a month since the passing of Dockland's Bishop, but rather than degenerating into a war zone, as was expected, the area seems to be running smoothly, on the rise as it were. Who is the new head of Dockland, and what are their plans for that valuable area of the city? (piano music) (knocking at door) (suspenseful music) - Dr. Franco? - Yes. - It's sharing time. - You're givin' until it hurts. (suspenseful music) - Hey. There's no need for that. - Who are you people? - [Alex] We need your help, doctor. - Fuckin' Dockland. (phone beeps) - [Secretary] Your doctor is here to see you, sir. - Send him in. Who the hell are you? - [Alex] Dr. Franco's sick, I'm covering for him. - Oh great. My fuckin' doctor's sick. That inspires confidence. All right. Let's do this. - I'm afraid that this one doesn't go in the arm. - What? - And they send a fuckin' woman. Don't you have somethin' you're supposed to be doing? I don't have all day. - You know, most people come in for these. - Well, I've got a city to run, babe. All the shots you gotta take these days, you can damn well come see me. - That's it. - Aren't you kinda hot to be a doctor? - Never a question I ask myself. - Oh no? You should. You've got quite a ... I think I'm having some kind of an allergic reaction. - That's not an allergy, Mr. Silverstone. It's poison. That's for my brother. - You bitch. They saw you come in here. There's no way you're gonna be able to hide. - Nowhere in the city, no. Goodbye, asshole. (suspenseful music) - Fuck. Stop that doctor! Don't let her out of the building! Boss? Boss! - [Man On Phone] She's gone sir. - Fuck. (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) - You okay? Let's go home.
