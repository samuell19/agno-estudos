I couldn't walk away. -Why? -[sighs] Let's just say at some point, your past refuses to stay... past. I got involved in a kidnapping... four women. -Sex trafficking? Who was she sold to? -There was a buyer, but the boss took a liking to her. Even more so when he found out about the baby. These rings are impenetrable. But when he decided he wanted to keep her, it caused problems, delays. Delays which gave me opportunity. -To steal her. -Stealing implies ownership. -That's how they all see it. [distant banging, clanking] [door opens] This past of yours...? Hit a little close, did it? -My life in this world... all started when I was stolen as a child, in broad daylight, from the streets of Naples. I won't let those things happen anymore to others. Not on my watch. No more innocence destroyed. You used to do the same. Protect innocence. -Getting emotionally attached... only leads to one thing... just ask Smithee. The baby, is it his? I need to call my handler. -What? No. -He's the only man on this planet I trust. -We can't trust anyone. -You have a better solution? -Fine. WALKER: We need to deactivate the signal jammer to get a call out. [grunts] You stay here. I need to... to turn off the signal jammer. -Where's that? -Security cabin. -Let me go. -I can walk this off. -I can walk now. Just keep her alive. -I can do that. -You make sure he does. -[distant indistinct chattering] [suspenseful music playing] WALKER: [voice-over] This man, what is he like? JULIET: [voice-over] Pure evil. -[sighs] -What's that around your neck? -Nothing. -You got family? -Not anymore. -I'm sorry. -My job is easier alone anyway. -If it's easier alone, why did you help us? Elda knew you would. -She's done her homework. She knows my past identities. After long enough, your past lives become a rumor, legend even. And she's been around long enough to hear them. -So, you used to help people and then you stopped, and now you're helping me? -I'm just trying to survive the night. -Whatever you say. -[sighs deeply] [indistinct chattering] [rapid gunfire] [empty guns clicking] -[kicks thrown] -[Elda grunting] [knife clanks] -[stabs knife] -[Elda grunts] [bones cracking] [body thuds] [breathing unsteadily] [signal jammer beeps] -You need me, little one.

[groans] -Jesus, Alexa. -Alexa? Is that your real name? -For now. You? -Scott, for now. -Mission successful. Except for a few mishaps. -[sarcastic tone] It's only a small stab wound to the chest. -The only thing we need now is phones. -The cloakroom. You able to function on that leg now? -I have to. [Elda grunts in pain] -Okay. Okay. I'm done. I'm done. That's cute. -Yeah. Even when in the dirtiest of waters, a lotus still produces the most amazing flower. -I love that. -It's a symbol of rebirth. -Okay, okay, I've got a sensitive side. We get it. [Juliet groans] -Breathe. -[worried] Is she okay? -I'm fine. -This time, we stick together. Someone needs to make sure you don't get stabbed. -She's killed three of our men to get to a signal jammer, and there's no sign of the girl. -So, what exactly are you still doing out here? KEATES: Useless morons. I'm going in. -The girl alive, Keates. Are you gonna make yourself useful or what? [thunder roaring] -[sighs heavily] I don't know about you but...

Why didn't we think about this before? They may not even be made. -We have to try. She has to disappear today. -Let's go.

Number one rule. -I know about your past. -You know nothing! -I know what happened. Your little girl's mother, killed in a revenge shooting because you got those hostages out of Yemen. You were trying to do the right thing and you were punished. But there comes a time-- -Time for what? My little girl will never be safe if I'm not dead to her. That's how we survive. No attachment.
