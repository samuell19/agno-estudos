Pardon me... - What's that? - Hi! Could you please hold my backpacks for two seconds? I need to buy some medicine for my dad. He had a heart attack a week ago. It's very urgent, but... OK. I'll be right back. - Hi! - Hello! - Four doughnuts, please. - Here you go. - Thanks! - You're welcome. We're leaving! You can swim if you want! I don't understand what you're saying. - Wait, I'm coming! - C'mon, c'mon! Thank you! Thank you, American boy! I'm so sorry. Dad! - Bye, American boy! - Goodbye! I've missed you, Daddy! - My little chicken! - Help me with this. Did you find a place in Berlin? I'm still waiting to find out when my internship will start. I can't wait to leave this country. My little mouse! - Mum! - Natasha! Vati, watch where you're putting those dirty backpacks! - We have mouse traps everywhere. - OK. - What's up, Mum? - Everything is fine. Did you see my e-mail about the wine event on Tuesday? I didn't. Are we going to sell part of the vineyard? Of course not. Dad said we may have to. - I didn't tell her that! - Yes, you did! You said Mum went crazy and the renovation got out of control and we can't keep up with our loans. You got out of control! You shouldn't have said anything. We'll pay the loans. I'm worried about you. I'm going to Berlin. Who will pay for you being in Berlin? They'll hire me after the internship. You've done two internships already and nobody hired you. That French dude tricked me. - French men are not reliable. - You're not reliable. You could've finished one of the many colleges we paid for. That was only 800 euros a year. Do you know how much other children cost? And who was paying your rent for 9 years? She wasn't that big of an expense. She's our little birdie. She's 28. 28 years old. She's not a child any more. You have a very westernized approach to raising children. I have been helping my parents since I was 7. Carrying barrels, picking grapes, kneeling in the vineyard for 12 hours a day... So you're punishing me because they were exploiting you? They didn't exploit me, they taught me to develop a work ethic. Why is it so hard for you to do the only thing we are asking of you? Because in the long term, its best for me to put my energy into creative pursuits. Let's go, Aleksi. Everybody's waiting. Our grandfather bought this land 70 years ago, to start a horse farm, but our grandma thought it'd be better to grow grapes. As you may see, women rule this family. To be unique, the wine needs to have its own character. Let them taste it. This is our new "Plavac Mali". - You can tell by its colour. - Hello. Aleksi, you devil, you're here! Will you give us a hand with the harvest? No, I'm going to Berlin. Forget Berlin! You'll never make a living as an artist. Look at this. Who are you kidding? Do you know what art is? Art is... Look at that French dude over there. Art is selling wine to a Frenchman who lives next to three vineyards. You're so wise. Whoever listens to me can do no wrong. Your dad was an artist, and what good did that do? There are a few eligible men here. two wine makers, one sailor... Why don't you catch one to help us with the winery? I'm not much of a hunter. - Jadran! - I'm coming! You're crazy as a loon! Okay, then grab your camera and take some photos... - Jadran! - I'm coming! So we can send it to the papers. - What the f**k! - Oh, s**t! Are you insane? I'm sorry, miss. I could pour some water on you, it will wash out. What an idiot. I'm just kidding. I came on a motorbike, I'll take you home to change. I'm willing to help out a young lady in trouble. Aleksi, your mum is looking for you. May I have your attention, please? Raise your glasses! Be careful not to spill the wine. We have live music coming up. All right, kid. Hit it! Hello! Aleksi, don't sit there like a snail. Slice some prosciutto for the singer. He can slice it himself. What kind of a hostess are you? What kind of a cripple are you if you can't slice it yourself? But a woman's hand is more precise. You need to practice precision. It will come in handy with the guitar. What's that, did you spill something? Hello? Hi. Is this Aleksi Bergando? Yes, it's her. I'm calling you regarding your internship. We are going through your application and we saw that your portfolio is not... Yeah, yeah. I thought about uploading it, but than I forgot. I'll send it to you now. OK? Right now! OK, thanks a lot! Bye! Bye! Daddy? - What's up? - Send me the scan of your photo "The two girls". - What for? - Just send it to me! - What do you need it for? - Forget it, I don't need it! Hi Supek, are you up? Are we going hunting on Sunday? Yes, yes, whatever it takes. - Why did you disappear yesterday? - I had pee on my shirt. Antunovic's children all helped host his wine tasting. Are you ever going to help me? Aleksi! Who's calling you? Aleksi! - That's her. - Aleksi Bergando? Yes? You've been accused of the theft of a motorbike with the numberplate: DU 921 EK. What motorbike? The one you parked two blocks away. - Oh, his motorbike? He was drunk... - She's lying! - He was not in a state to drive. - She's a liar and a thief! - I'm not lying! - Considering the evidence, I have to take you to the station. You have the right to a lawyer... You peed on me, you moron! F**king peasants! - I'll take a s**t on your head! - Take it easy! Where are my keys? Under the seat! What do you think is the origin of the phrase 'Go haywire'? "You went haywire." Do you want to warm me up? I'm playing ping pong with Supek for 300 Euros. Don't let that a***hole scr*w you. He pretends he can't play, until you play for money. Then suddenly his forehand starts working like a charm. Don't fall for it. I heard today there's a new photography contest: "Vineyards of Europe". You could do some photos for it. And for our website. Jadran said our photos are outdated. Jadran doesn't comprehend the quality of an analogue camera. - Like landscape photography? - I would go for the abstracts. We could do it later today? Abstracts don't work for the web, you artists... Lea! Lea! You're here! I'm stuck between stations. I know what it's like to get stuck. What do you want, Jacob? Don't eat that before lunch. Go to the house. Watch your step! Wanna go to the beach later? I made a plan with my dad to do some photos. I'll leave the kids with my d**k*ss husband. It'll be a nice break. We could take photos of me for Instagram. I lost my baby weight. Mum! - C'mon. - Okay. - C'mon! - Wait. Watch out! Don't run on the boat! - Slow down! - F**k! What's up? Where's your worse half? F***er scr*wed me over. This is Aleksi. - Toni, friend of the family. - Aleksi, family. Nice to meet you. Don't be so boring with that phone. I need to tell d**k*ss to go f**k himself. Be in the moment. What was I going to write? Be in the moment! You'll send the wrong message! - Jacob, catch! - I'm gonna kill you! Are you mental? Don't play with that! Jacob! Give it back! You're a jerk! You're an idiot! Good job, Jacob. Here you go. Done swimming already? I'm already dry, and if I go into the sea now my suit may not get dry again, so there's a chance of getting a bladder infection. Bunch of problems. You need a boyfriend. What makes you think I don't have one? You're here with an old man, four kids and a boring cousin... Who's not in the f***in' moment. - Who took the sandwiches? - Aleksi ate them. Toni said you're boring. Like he's so much fun. No more sandwiches, we have grapes. No! We want sandwiches! Your kids are spoiled. Where's their mum? It's a private matter. - You asked me if I had a boyfriend. - No, I didn't. Not in those words, but that was your point. I'm in the process of getting one, but it's not official yet. F***in' sandwiches. "Sandwiches, sandwiches!" Why did your wife leave you? It was a mutual separation. And? I get the kids during the weekends and holidays. That's just f***ing fantastic. That seems to favour women, but actually... You get to dedicate yourself to your work, you don't have to worry about getting the kids to school, and then you get them when you're free and have nothing better to do. F***in' assholes. They're gonna ruin me. I need a break. I'll kill myself. I need to help you girls relax. - Where's your man? - At home. How is he? He's okay. He's got boring. I'm not sure if I'm still in love. Blow him. If you're into it, it means you are. Thank God! Did you walk to the river to get that water? - A double Jager for me. - I'll have two Mojitos. Don't put ice into the second one. - You're too old for this place. - So are you. Are you and Lea's husband friends in life or just here because there're no other options? We are thick as thieves. Why? Would he be your emergency call if you accidentally killed somebody? To help you hide the body? I think I'd call my mum. She's a badass. - Who would you call? - Maybe Lea. I couldn't call my mum. She'd kill me if I killed somebody. And my dad would tell my mum. Although, Lea might panic and we wouldn't get far with the body. What? I said that we wouldn't get far with the body. Could you please remove your hand? It's a gayish gesture. I think it's very straight. Let's go. There was a drought for an hour and now it's pouring! - You got it? - Of course. - Did you get it? - No. - C'mon! - No. Oh, c'mon! Give it back. Jana used to carry me home when I got f***ed up. Stop! Stop! Police! - F***! Let's go! - Easy. Don't panic. We're just walking. Police! Stop! Stop provoking me. Wait. Easy, easy. - Is this okay? - It's fine. Are you okay? What is it? Where are you going? Can I walk you home? Hey! Are you okay? Is everything all right? No! I don't want that! You're pulling my hair! Too bad. Now hug me and don't let go. If you let go, we're both scr*wed. - Do we have a deal? - Your ear is so small. Really small. Like a little clam. Great. What? You can't wake people up like that! What about: dear Goran, thank you for carrying me, and saving my life... Now you owe me. You have to make me breakfast. Slice me some prosciutto. If you behave nicely, you can come to my concert. Goran... I think I peed the bed. Mozzarella and cherry tomatoes. Thank you. How are the things in the winery? All right. How are your guitar lessons going? We have a concert next weekend. Great. Do you have a boyfriend? - No. Do you have a girlfriend? - No. Why? - I asked you because you asked me. - I just wondered. Are you coming to my concert? I have to see what else is happening that night. Well, see you. You still haven't gone to Berlin? Nope. Did you get that job? They could be calling me any day now. - Hi, Daddy! - Hi. Look at my new mouflon! My adorable new golden mouflon. Just look at him! I caught him the other day. I waited for 7 hours to catch him... - How much did you pay to catch it? - 7,000 euros. If your mother asks, I got it from the bet with Supek. He's so beautiful. Look at him. - Where have you been? - Nowhere. What's that on you? Well, I got kinda drunk so some guy carried me to his place and then I peed in his bed... So he lent me these clothes. At least you didn't s**t the bed. Daddy's little embarrassment. - Aleksi, are you in there? - I'm in the shower. - Will you be ready soon? - Relatively soon. Some Germans are coming to get some wine for their restaurant. Aleksi, did you hear me? I thought that Germans loved beer. You need to go and show them the winery! I'll be ready... in 25-40 minutes. Aleksi, now! I need you now! Do you hear me? Wait! She doesn't care about it. Who will take over the winery? Don't bury us just yet. American boy! Wait! Wait, wait! Hi! Hello! Hi! It's you, the girl from the ferry! Hello, what's up? What are you doing? I'm just exploring... Can you drive? Yeah. What do you know about wines? - They are made from grapes. - Great. Hi! - Hello! - I'm sorry, I'm late. - I'm Aleksi. - Nice to meet you. Just a second. - Impressive cellar. - Yeah. I'm told you make very, very good Dingač. Yes, that's true. It is very good. Why don't you describe it to us? Well, our grapes are very special because we have these... grape-sniffing cats, who find the right grape to harvest. But, maybe Christian can tell you more about this because he's a very famous sommelier from Napa Valley. So... Just... Yes, they breed the cats right here on the premises actually. It's a special technique and it really adds to the flavour. Interesting. Yeah. You can pour them some wine. Yes, please. You know awfully little about wine for the daughter of a wine maker. That's because I'm a photographer. Oh, photographer? OK, OK. That's quite a coincidence. I'm a photographer as well. Really? Yeah, what sorts of things do you shoot around here? Well, I just got a job in Berlin. - Oh, Berlin. I love it. - I'm moving there soon. And you? What are you doing here? Well... I was supposed to meet my girlfriend in Dubrovnik, but she didn't show up. What did you do? - What did I do? - Yes. Well... I got a job offer to go to Egypt for six months and she didn't want me to go, but I decided that I had to. I just couldn't pass it up. I don't think she liked that. So... Well that sounds like a break-up message. Maybe, maybe. What? - Open your mouth! - No. - Please! - No. - No. - Please, for me. OK. Little closer. Little closer. - Are you OK? - A got a little bit in the eyes. Is it good? Oh, it's good. It's definitely good. - You want more? - I would love some. You are a weird girl. My ferry's going to be leaving in just a couple of hours I think. Thanks for wasting time with me. - You owe me now. - Oh, I do? OK, well... Next time you're in New York, I'll take you to mess with some tourists there. Hope I see you again. Well, if it's meant to be, we will. So... Bon voyage! Bye! INTERNSHIP REQUEST Don't forget to go to the winery later. Buyers from Italy are scheduled to come. I promised a friend to go to his concert. Nobody else is free to go. F**k it. Everything is more important to you than your family. Kid! Didn't I tell you to take out the bullets? I'm sorry. Sit over there! Sit and be quiet! Great night, everybody! And now, Goran and the Satellites. We love you, Lidija! It wasn't so bad! Goran! You stupid egomaniac! Do you honestly think it was good? Your audience was a bunch of peasants and their kids. What did you expect? They don't dig singers like Leonard Cohen. Yeah, they wouldn't dig Cohen. What did you take that time? Cocaine. I got fucked up because I drank. Usually drugs don't do it. Once I tried ecstasy and almost fell asleep. Interesting. I tried mushrooms too... it was similar to weed. And MDMA. MDMA? - And? - That was the only drug that had an effect on me, although it ended badly. You had to go to rehab? I didn't get addicted. I was just crazy promiscuous. OK. - I don't need to know about it. - Yeah. Better not. How many guys did you sleep with? One. That's not crazy promiscuous. Crazy is maybe too strong of a word. But, I'd slept with just one guy before my ex-boyfriend and then another one while I was with that boyfriend. It's not like I've slept with hundreds of guys. When you said it, I thought there must be at least ten. It's not such a disaster. Yeah. But the problem is that this guy was my ex's friend. I mean, I was really horny and he was there. We just f***ed a few times and... Is it weird for you to listen to this? - What? - No. - It is. - Oh well, it is. But continue. So, Matej, that friend, couldn't keep the secret, and he told everything to my boyfriend, who then beat him up with a baseball bat. Broke his jaw. Fuck. Yeah. Your father is sad because you don't play ping pong with him any more. It will be worse if I kick his ass. You could play one game. You should spend some time with us. - You're never at home. - OK Mum. - Will you? - Fine! Sorry. What's going on with the internship in Berlin? I don't know yet. You haven't mentioned it for a while. Are you trying to mindf**k me so I lose? Maybe this is a sign you should reconsider staying here. What can I do here? It's not so bad here. I know what's it like to live abroad. The jobs foreigners can get are usually physical labour or waiting tables. It's beneath your dignity to harvest grapes in your own vineyard or pour wine for guests in your own winery. Look at the house you're living in. Look at the stone it's made of. You'd need to have ten flatmates to live in a house like this abroad. I'm not going to Hong Kong. Brilliant people start things first in a place where there's nobody. Let's play for points. The left hand. - Hi. - Hi. I can't do anything right now. I need to do this. Look at these small balls. We could walk airily If you split a cake fairly... I'm good. I could be a new drummer in your band. And vocalist. I could be a vocalist and a drummer. We could name the band Aleksi and Goran's Satellites. If I stop doing this, it's going to be hard to resume. It's going to be hard to resume taping the styrofoam? The neighbours complained about our rehearsals. I have to finish this. Let me know when you're available. OK. Yeah. Bye. Bye. - You're judging me. - What? You wanted to know about me. You were asking questions - but now you're judging me. - I'm not judging you! I'm the only one hanging out with you, no matter what other people are saying. What are they saying? What are they saying, Goran? Nothing. I wouldn't hang out with you if I was judging you. Thank you so much for hanging out with me. Lea! Lea! - What happened? - Hi. What's going on? Nothing. Lea, are you OK? It's nothing. - Dickass was here. - And? I threatened to leave him. He went crazy, he took the kids to live with him. Like that fucker can take care of them. Stupid jerk. He'll give them back soon. Hello, hello American boy! Hello, hello Croatian girl! Where shall we go? Let's go for a swim. I didn't really shower today. All right. Sounds good. Let's get you clean! How long are you staying here? Well... It kind a depends. So you came just for me? I have some meetings in Korčula. Yeah, meetings with me! Oh, meetings with you! Shut up! Come on! You p*ssy! What? Just taking my time! Fuck! Fuck! I've got cramp! I've got cramp! You got what? Fuck! Swim to me. I'm coming. Okay. - Where does it hurt? - Here. Sorry. What are you doing? Hey, don't stink this up! Come on! No! No! I'm sorry. Smells lovely. Thank you very much. And cheers! Wanna sit here? Can we do "Salt in the wounds"? The next song is a new one. For the girl who stole my motorbike. Tell me we still exist Just hiding somewhere Tell me I'm still In your dreamy mind What are you thinking about? Important things have washed out I'm thinking, why is this place called three palms and there are only two? And now we're here where we are We hate that we love each other I put the blame on the words Yesterday we rubbed it in Today it hurts He's a cute boy. Silence won't wash The salt in the wounds Yeah. I put the blame on the words Yesterday we rubbed it in Today it hurts Silence won't wash The salt in the wounds Don't give her that s**t! Don't you see she's f***ed up? Mind your own business. She doesn't take that stuff well. And what in the hell are you doing with such a young girl? Stop laughing. Are you f***in' this girl? And what do you give a s**t? If you're not f***in' her, back off. - What are you doing! - Let him go! Hit him! Hit him! Peasants! What? I think that you're f***ed up too! F***ed up and a mute! I'm not gonna be your girlfriend! I don't care what you think about me! Do you hear me? F**k you! Here, here, here. I'm falling! - Do you want a sandwich? - Sure. AMERICAN BOY Catch! - How old do you think this is? - 100 years. I heard that two mouflons got in a fight over you. - What two? - Any good out of these two? And I heard that dad didn't win the golden mouflon on a bet, but he caught it himself for 7,000 euros. She's lying! I'm not lying! Go to Supek's and check it yourself. You'd take the last penny from my sock! When I'm hunting, my blood is rushing like... I feel like I'm young again... You're old, you fool. I'll never tell you anything again! Aleksi! - Hi! - Hi! - Hello! - Hello! Hi. Christian, Goran. - Hi, Goran. - How do you do, Goran. Christian, he is a sommelier from Napa Valley. - Friend. - Right. - Do you wanna sit with us? - Yes. - No, I should probably get going. - No! Sit. If you insist. What are you having? - Coke and a mixed pizza. - OK. Do you want anything else? Sir? I'll have a lemonade. - You? - Do you have? Actually, hm... The pasta with prawns, how many prawns are actually in there? There are as many as usual. - What's usual, two or fifty? - There are definitely not fifty. - OK. - Women. OK then, I'll have the sea bass pie. I wouldn't recommend getting a sea bass here. Get a pizza and move on! Don't put pressure on me! OK, pizza! What do you think about the wines here? I feel like I'm intruding. No! You are not. - No! You are not. - I just ate already, I'll let you guys be alone. - I'll see you later. - You just ordered your drink. Bye! Dad's friend. Should I just go to Berlin and see what happens? I didn't plan on being here this long. How long would you stay there? Forever. I mean, what can I do here? I have no friends here. OK, you and me are hanging out, but there's nobody else my age... Of course. What? Nothing. You're having a strange reaction. Well, I'm not mad. - Why would you be mad? - I'm not mad! Marin! - This is too much money, Goran. - It's fine. Take it! Why are you upset? Goran! Goran, I can't live with my mum and dad! I love hanging out with you, but that's such a small percentage of my time. Do you care about me? I can't live in a place without a critical mass of intellectuals... Do you care about me? I care about you. But I care about myself too. Why were you so persistent if you don't care about me? You've no idea what you want, you're selfish and you use people to feed your ego and solve your stupid problems! Go! Go to f***ing Berlin and find some other fool to help you live with yourself! We could continue our sexual relationship while I'm still here. F**k you! LEA Can I take a picture of you? You look cinematic. Colours of dancing crinolines Fireflies in my hands Fireflies... Hi. Hi. Play it. Play it until the end. Violin, burn the bridges Oh Messiah, break with sound Hands play on painful strings Burn the bridges, tear them down Violin, scream and cry! Bring the day to the firefly May it slay with your hand Burn the wood, blow the sand... It's good. It is really... It's going to be a hit, I bet. Did you change your mind? - Did you change your mind? - We still have time. If you didn't, please leave. - You're making me feel guilty. - Go away! - What have I done? - Go away! Goran! Aleksi! Hi! Come in. You have a great place. Do you want to drink something? Coffee, tea... wine, grappa? What's going on? Did something happen? What's going on? Toni, life is short and I have to ask you something. Yes? When are you going back to Paris? In a week or two, I guess. - Why? - Can I come? To Paris? Like, live with me in Paris? Until I get on my feet. Temporarily. We are f***ed up, Aleksi. You're f***ed up, I'm f***ed up. Divorced, with two kids. A bunch of people are relying on me. My life is already messed up as it is. - Sorry. - No... it's okay. - Do you want some sugar? - Sure. Don't drag like a slow-poke. Speed up a tad! What the hell is that? Did you have religious education at school? Yeah... You could pick between that and Ethics. I didn't want to listen to preaching about morals, so I thought... I'd rather pray. You should've prayed more. Did you see how we re-did the Tasting Room? Like you're trying to gather the Knights of the Round Table. And here... kid! Devil! Here is where you pour them the wine. We have... Yes! You'll need that. We adapt the price list to the purchasing power. Art is knowing how to sell men's shoes to a widow. Let's go! You'll fall, you little monkey! You're finished! My great grandfather bought this land 70 years ago, with the intention of turning it into a horse farm. But, our grandma thought it would be better to grow grapes.
