Is someone there? Please, help me. I know you can hear me. It's dark, and I'm cold. Oh, thank god! Please, you have to help me! I have to get out of here! Do you speak English? Please... um... A little. Who are you? My name is John. John Andre. I'm a student at the technical university. A student? I have classes to attend! If I miss them, they'll cancel my permit of residency. John, listen to me. I'm locked in here as well. But we will find a way out, together, okay? Okay. Can you get the door open? It's very dark in here. Something is blocking the door. I can't open it, I'm sorry. Do you know where we are? No, I wish I did. I was blind-folded; they put me in the back of a car. And we were driving for about twenty minutes. I think we're still in Dresden. Dresden? We're in the east? If we can just let someone know where we are, if we can contact the police or something... John, listen, listen, listen! I'm a West German citizen. Okay? And when I call the police, the only ones who will come are the people that put us in here! Do you understand? Can you get us out of here? Is there another door or a window on your side? There is a door but it's locked. I've tried it but I couldn't open it. And nothing else? Nothing we could use? No, only a phone. But it doesn't work. I tried it but I couldn't get a line. Wait! Please! Please don't leave me, Miss- John? Was it them? Yes. What did they want? Why are they keeping us here? I have information they need to know. Who are you? I work in a federal ministry. I'm a junior secretary for Georg Leber. A junior secretary? Yes. What do they want with a secretary? Many things. What, because you pour the coffee and answer the phone? And file documents. Many, many documents. Oh god. What did you do? Did you promise them files? Did you say you'd pass them information? It wasn't supposed to happen. Not like this. Not like what? Someone I trusted. I was supposed to meet him. Tell them. Tell them! I cannot. Sophie Tell them what they want to know. There is nothing so important that you should lose your life protecting it. Just tell them what you know. John? You must believe me. If I tell them what they want to know both of us will not make it out alive. John? I can see something through the door. What? What can you see? I can see trees. Many trees. I think we're in the countryside, somewhere. They have dogs. What? I've heard dogs. We won't get far in the forest if they have dogs. Can you move? No. They've done a pretty good job of tying me up. Hold on. John? I can see you! Wait. Sorry, it won't move anymore. Wait. Oh, sorry. Better? Much. Thank you. Pleased to meet you. So am I. Looks like they treat the ladies better here. No ropes. No, no, I cut myself free, with my glasses. What kind of junior secretary are you? One who has to think fast. I don't suppose I could borrow those glasses? Right. Sorry John, they are broken. I will find something else, okay? John? I can't find anything. It's okay. Are you, are you thirsty? Yeah, very. Can you reach it? Slowly, slowly, don't choke. Save some for later. John, what did you study? You said you were in a university. What kind? Agriculture. Planting, um, tractors... farming. Yes, Agrarwissenschaften. Sorry, I'm terrible but, Your English is certainly better than my German. But, your German is really not good. No, no it's, no, it's terrible, really. Yeah but, good enough to study in East Germany? One of my class mates was very nice to me, Katerina... Rina, she helped me a lot. It doesn't make sense. Sorry? John? What are you not telling me? Why are you here? What happened when they took you in? Well, I, I was walking home from school, two men passed by, I heard something, and, and, I turned and then they hit me. And then I was blindfolded and in the back of a car and now this. I don't know what else you want me to say. You don't believe me. It's the truth, it's what happened! What is an Englishman doing in Dresden, studying agriculture? It's part of a cultural exchange thing. They want young people from other countries to come and see how wonderful life is in the East. Look, I'm nobody. And then here, it's different. Here I'm important. People are always asking me what I think. And these people, they bring me to nice restaurants. The kind that ordinary folk aren't allowed in. It's all rubbish. And I know that and my handlers know that. You can't tell me that the bleedin' GDR is the greatest country in the world and that the people lack for nothing and then turn around and ask me to send nylons for your wife from home. Not if you're... damned Stasi. Not if you want to be taken seriously - Stasi? Just a fellow I met once. What did he want? Nothing. He was probably just a nobody who wanted to impress me. John, what did he want? Nothing, he was drunk. I barely spoke to the man. I haven't eaten in days, I'm babbling. I probably- John, did he ask you to work for them? Sophie. Don't-If I was mixed up in this, If I knew anything, don't you think I would tell you? No. Don't you trust me? What did he want? I- Hello? Sophie? Are you there? What did they say? Sophie? Sophie? John? Are you an informant for the Stasi? No, I'm not! Sophie, what are you doing? What are you doing, what? Please! Sophie! You have to believe me, I have nothing to hide! I'm not a spy or an informant! Sophie! God damn it, Sophie! Talk to me! You have to tell me the truth, John! I am! Tell me the truth. They know things, Sophie. They know everything, even when they're drunk, they know everything. They were going to send her away. He came to my table, I thought he was just being friendly, and told me that they knew. They knew that we were going to take a train and then a bus to Budapest. They knew that we decided that Prague was too dangerous so we were going through Brno, they even knew the name of the café on the corner where I arranged to meet Rina. He told me, all that I had to do was this one little thing. Just a meeting. Simple. And he would personally sign Rina's exit visa. And we wouldn't have to sneak through half a dozen countries. He would just walk us up to Checkpoint Charlie and raise the gates himself. And if not well, Rina isn't German and Russia is a big place. I wanted to marry her, Sophie. She was funny and clever; she'd tell you any capital city in the world. If you can believe that... She grew up in a little village in Russia and she could tell you the capital of Malaysia. Kuala Lumpur. What? Kuala Lumpur. They say be careful who you fall in love with. You ever been in love, Sophie? Yes. When I first arrived in Dresden everyone warned me about these... these girls. These girls who picked up lonely foreign men and make them fall in love. I thought that Rina was one of these girls I was convinced of it. I had my guard up but turned out that she wasn't. But I got in trouble anyway. What happened after? They gave me an address, outside the city. He was supposed to be there already. I was supposed to meet him and hand him the money and he would give me the package. They gave me instructions. Do not do anything that makes him suspect you're being followed. He will not do the switch if he knows we are watching. Something was wrong from the start, I could feel that. No one was sure whether we'd been stood up or if somebody had gotten the time wrong. Deal is off. Close it down. The target has not appeared. He is here, I repeat, he's here! Yes. You're English. Interesting. You got something for me? Is this your first drop off? Just follow the instructions and you'll be fine. What was his name? His name? Tell me his name, John. Schäfer. Dieter Schäfer. They got him. Out in the open. Oh god. Sophie, I'm sorry! No, he told me to wait for him! You're lying! No! No, you're lying. He's not dead. No, he's not dead! Sophie, I'm sorry. I didn't know. NO! Sophie, please! Sophie! NO! SOPHIE! They left him there? Sophie! Sophie! We have to get out of here. Dieter is gone, but you're not. I don't care. We still have to get out of here! No. You can't think about him now. Save that for later! Sophie! You have to figure out a way to get us both out of here. No. Listen to me, do you understand me? Sophie, what can you do, to get us out of here? I don't know, the door is locked. I don't know! Look again, see if you can find something to cut these ropes. Take this. Now, Sophie. Try the door. Go to the door, smash it. Just break it, Sophie. You can do it. What should I find? I don't know, something heavy. Break the lock, just smash it. Stupid. So, so stupid. John. Rina told me right from the beginning. Everyone has secrets. Everyone. Be careful who you tell your secrets to. And I never listened. John You were spying on me! All this time, you were spying on me. No, I didn't know, I wouldn't have! What do you want to know? I told you everything. What else do you want? John, please. You already know how Rina and I were planning to get out. Is that what they want? You you understand what we were saying? What else do you want to know? Yes, I work for the British government. Yes, I understand a little German. You... you are MI6. I needed to get Rina out. That was the one good thing that could have come from this! I had a plan. But you already know all that, don't you? They promised me to let us go. That was another lie, don't you think? They promised that you could live, didn't they? What about me? What about me, Sophie? WHAT ABOUT ME? Ah. Thank you for being truthful for once in your fucking life. Now we both wait here to die. No, John, please don't leave me! John, trust me! What was in the package? The package? Forget that I asked. It doesn't matter. Nothing you know could be worth all this. The location of missiles. American missiles. In West Germany, pointed at the East. Sophie! How could you do that! The number of lives you've put at risk! So many people in the world. And only one who made me feel like I wasn't alone. That I mattered. Information like that could start a war! He needed me. No one's ever needed me. It's a damn stupid thing you did. And I would do it again. In a heartbeat. Sophie, where are those documents? Listen to me, Sophie! What you did, the information you tried to sell, they don't have it. Yet. But they will. And soon. Whatever Dieter told you about balancing the scales, that's not for you and me to decide. Balancing the scales! If things in the east were so wonderful, they'd be building walls to keep people out not to keep people in! This is a country that no one wants to be a part of! Help me to get out of here! Help me find those documents. Help me destroy them. I made a promise. He's dead. I promised him. He gave you up. He gave you up. He took the money. He told us exactly where you would be waiting. Only you didn't have the documents on you. You told me he was dead! Better you think he died for you! Better than knowing! Help me. Help me make this right again! Again. One more. Thank you. Get us out of here. Hello? Rina! They have Rina! Let me talk to them. Miss Zimmermann has forced us to be more creative in our approach. You will ask her where the documents are. Ask her where the documents are located. She will answer. Please, Sophie! Is Dieter alive? Don't bargain with them! Is he alive? Is Dieter alive? I don't know. She doesn't know! She would tell you! Please, just let Rina go! Sophie, please! I have other information, I have names, I have identities! Please! Sophie! For me! For Rina! Please! Here! The documents are here! Rina? Rina? RINA! I wasn't lying. I am MI6. So... All in here. Complete. You were a very real concern for us, Miss Zimmermann. Embarrassing for the Bundesrepublic, very dangerous for everyone else. Your hands, please. Where are we? We are somewhere in Dortmund. Far from anyone. They will come for me. Someone will know I'm gone. Someone from the office. No, I don't think they will. Nobody knows where you are, No one wants to know. Ever since that incident with Mr. Guillaume. It's too embarrassing. Are you going to kill me? Best not to think about that Don't go anywhere. What you said about Dieter. Is it true? Tell me. Is he alive? Not for long. Where is he? He's here. Please. May I see him? Dieter! Sorry. Sophie! Sophie! Sophie! Open the door! Go. Sophie? Sophie. Sophie, don't go, don't leave me here! You can't leave me here, Sophie! I'll die in here! Talk to me, Sophie! Talk to me! Sophie.
