Joe! - Please, god, if Joe's alive, just let me know. Give me some kind of a sign that my son is not dead. Orders for the 30-foot section. Yes, on Monday. Okay, I'm about to finish the corrections of the McNally plans. Carl can take care of it. You need to get out of here. Carl has his hands full with the cedar town job. Randy, I promise the place won't fall apart while you're gone, and your wife's still holding on line two. Okay, put her through. - Hello. - Don't tell me you're still at the office. - All right, I won't tell you. - Dang it, Randy, you promised you'd help me pack the Van. We're supposed to pick up Zack and Tucker from school at 11:00. - I know. I'm wrapping it up. - You also promised you weren't gonna go into work today. That's what this trip is all about. - Okay, I'm leaving now. - Fine, bye. - Tater, Cleo, cut it out! Come on. Daddy's home! - Zoom, zoom, zoom. - There he is. - Daddy, daddy! - Hey, buddy. Hey, how you doing? Wanna go to the beach? - Yeah, I wanna see a shark. A shark? Big Joe simpkins, fearless shark hunter. Daddy. - Okay, I'm a great white! I'm gonna get you! I'm gonna get you! Arr! Arr! - Boom, boom! You got a 25-footer. Good job, buddy. Good job. Give me five. - Big shark dead. - I'm sorry, okay. - Vacation's supposed to be a chance for you to spend some time with you family for a change. You're not getting off to a very good start. - We haven't left yet. Okay, you're right. - I thought you were gonna take that dog to the pound. - I was. I just haven't had time. - Well, if he stays here any longer, Joe's never gonna let you take him. We don't need another dog. - Got it. - I go to pawpaw's. - No. - I go to pawpaw's! - No! Joe, you're staying right here. We're just about to leave. This is what I've been dealing with all morning. This has got to be the tenth time he's told me he's going to pawpaw's. - Hey, buddy, you can't go to pawpaw's right now, okay, 'cause pawpaw's out working. - There's some bags inside the door that need to be loaded. I'm gonna start closing up the house. You can go ahead and buckle him up in the Van. - All right, come on, buddy, you heard your momma. Let's get in the Van. - I ride my bike. - All right, well, you're gonna be cooped up in here for a long time so go ahead, but stay right here, okay. Okay? Okay, daddy. - Whoa! Hey! Hey, buddy, you got a license to drive that thing? Get daddy! Look out! - Hey, you are a crazy driver! I did it! - What are you doing? - Just shutting down the computer. - No, you're not, you're checking your work email. - Let's not get into this again. - Okay. I need to go to the bathroom. I'll meet you out there. - Joe! Joe! Joe! Did Joe come inside with you? - No. You didn't put him in the Van? - He was just out here riding his trike a minute ago. - Well, he probably headed for your parents'. - He's never done that before. - How would you know? He followed Zach and Tucker there just last week. - Joe! Joe! - I'll check around here. Why don't you check the trail to pawpaw's? - Okay. - Joseph simpkins! You better get in this Van if you know what's good for you! - Joe! - Joe! - Hello. - Hey, is Joe over there with you? - No, is there a problem? - Well, we were just about to pull out, and he disappeared. He's been telling me all day he wants to go to pawpaw's. I figured he headed your way. - No, I'm looking out the back, but all I see is Randy. - All right, just keep an eye out for him. I'm gonna keep looking around here. - Okay. I just told christal I haven't seen him. I'll check around the house. I just hope he's okay. - I'm sure he is, momma. He'll probably show up any minute. - I'm gonna go check sweetgrass. - Okay. - Joe, if you're hiding from me, you better come out now or you'll get the whooping you'll never forget! - Joseph simpkins, if you can hear me, you better answer me! Joe! Joe! - Joe! - Did you find him? - No. - I checked the pond behind mom and dad's. I checked the entire sweetgrass yard. I don't understand it. He could not have gone that far. - He's probably just hiding from US, thinking that this is a game. - That doesn't make any sense. He knew we were about to leave. - Honey, he's two years old. He doesn't do anything that makes sense. I guess I'll go check with the neighbors, see if he went visiting. I don't know where else to check right now. I turned the house upside down. - Yeah, I'll keep checking the fields. Joe! - Hello, christal, is there something wrong? - We can't find Joe. We were just about to leave for vacation, and he's just vanished. - Well, I haven't seen him. - I was thinking about your pool, and how he always want to come swimming. Goodness, we don't have the cover on it. - Okay, I'm gonna continue up the street and check to see if anybody else has seen him. Will you keep an eye out? - My older boy's home. We'll look around. I don't wanna be a bother. - Don't be silly. He's your son. We need to find him. - Thank you. - Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe, where are you, Joe? Joe, can you hear me? Joe! - Any news yet? - I checked with most of the neighbors, and those who are out are looking for him. - I'll call Larry. He's with a crew in cedar town, but he'll wanna know what's happening. - I'm gonna go by miss grace's place, and then head home. - Lord, I just hope that little boy is okay. - He better pray I don't wring his neck when we find him. - Joe! Joe! Carroll county 9-1-1. Do you have an emergency? - Yes. What is the nature of your emergency, sir? - Our son is missing. What's your name, sir? - Randy simpkins. I'm his father. Are you currently at your residence on 1-5-0 wilderness trail? - Yes. What is the name and age of your child? - He's a two-year-old boy. His name is Joe. He was playing on our driveway, and then he just, he vanished. How long has he been missing? - Maybe, I guess 30 minutes, maybe 45 minutes. We searched everywhere, inside the house, outside the house, the whole area. I've already dispatched a deputy to assist you. Please remain at your home until he arrives. - They'll be here soon? Yes, sir, they're on their way. - Thank you. Thank you very much. - You're a little close to the phone lines. - Randy's boy Joey's gone missing back at his place. I'm gonna head home to help look. - You want US to come with you? - I appreciate it, but this job has a tight deadline. - You sure? We can just start extra early in the morning. - They'll probably find him before I even get there. You boys better keep at it. Sorry I have to leave you like this. Good luck, boss. You heard the man. Let's get back to work. - This is my wife, christal. - Hi, I'm seargeant Bert Smith. - Hi. I understand your boy is missing. - That's right. Where did you last see him? - I already told you... - I need to hear it from her, sir. Do you mind if we step over here? - Sir, I apologize, but what did you say your name was again? - Division chief benefield, carroll county fire rescue, but you can call me bud. - Okay, bud, why is he questioning my wife like that? I already gave him all the same info. - Nothing to worry about. Just wanna maybe see if she remembers anything that you might have missed. - Mind if we have a look inside? - No, of course not. - You've checked the house thoroughly? - Several times. - Was your son in trouble? Have you had an argument with him or anything like that? - No, no, he was excited about the trip. There was no reason for him to be afraid? He wasn't being punished for anything? - No, sir, no. Excuse US a moment. - What are you thinking? - Everything seems to check out to me. Their stories match. Nice home, well maintained, Van loaded for vacation, just like they said. - And they're not frequent flyers with your department or anything like that? - No, this is the first time I ever been here. Fact is, I understand the sheriff knows the family. - This is gonna be a bear of a search. There's a lotta woods and brush out here. This is gonna take a lot of manpower. - Yeah, guess we better get to it. - Is something wrong? Are we suspects or something? - No, ma'am, not at all. We just have to be certain that before we call the cavalry that we understand the situation. - You mean, if we're telling the truth. - Not every call we get is what it appears to be, especially when children are involved. I hope you understand. - Yeah, we do understand. - Have you seen any unusual vehicles in the area lately, or any strangers? - You don't think somebody grabbed him, do you? - I doubt it. You're pretty isolated out here and all. It'd be hard for someone to do it and not be seen, but it has happened. Anyone you know holding a grudge against you, a disgruntled employee or a family member? - No, no, none that I can think of. - Seargeant Smith and I are gonna step outside and make some calls for additional manpower and resources. Once they're on their way, I'll need to go over more details with the two of you. - If you have a recent photo of your son, it'd be a big help. - Yeah, sure. I'd like the two of you to show me on a map where you've looked and where you think he might have gone. And don't worry too much. He'll probably come wandering up any minute, but if he doesn't, we'll have a lotta people here looking for him real soon. - Thank you. - Helo. - Hello, pastor Jerry, this is Mary simpkins. - Mary, what can I do for you? My grandson Joe, Randy and christal's baby boy, has disappeared. We're looking all over for him. The police are here and everything. My goodness, Mary, you don't think that someone took off with him, do you? - I don't know. I think he just wandered off. There's so many lakes and ponds around here, and lots of woods. He's never just walked off like this before. - I understand. It's okay, Mary. - I was hoping that we might get a prayer chain started. - I think that would be a good idea. - I'm making some calls but there's a lotta names. - I'll get some help. Do they need anyone to help search? - I think so. We'll get some volunteers, too. - Thank you. - Mary, it's gonna be okay. God will be right here, and remember, he's with Joe, too. All members should bring atvs if available. Dispatch is clear, 803. 803 is gold dust command. Randy, hang on. I need you over here for a minute. - Yeah. - I need you to stay here for right now. - Why? I'm just standing around. I should be out looking for my son. - I understand, but we have a lot of professional searchers headed our way and we gotta have a game plan when they get here. Plus, I need you here to help me paint a picture of this area so we can get them in the field as quickly as possible. - Okay, I could have been doing that the last 15 minutes. - If you had, then they wouldn't be on their way right now, plus I had to call the state emergency management office to request the resources that are gonna take the longest to get, like a helicopter, so we can have it here when it'll do US some good. How's it going? - Dnr says they can have one in 45, but their chopper's not flir-equipped. Our state patrol friend over there says he's got one that's flir-equipped... - flir? - But it doesn't have an eta. - What... - it's a forward-looking infrared camera. It can detect objects like a heated body through the trees. - That's not gonna be much good on a hot day like this. - Maybe not but if we get into the night, it will, plus with all the foliage out here, it's gonna be hard for a chopper to have any kind of vision anyway. It's better than not having one. - Bud, the chopper will be all set in an hour. Tell 'em to head this way. - Okay. - What about the canine unit? - They're working on drug interdiction up in meriwether. Eta is about an hour. - We can't wait that long to get the search teams in the field. - What's the problem? - Normally, you want the dogs to get into the field first. Once the search teams get out there, they can confuse the scent. It's better late than never. Let's just get 'em here, all right? Randy, show me where you've looked, and what neighbors you checked with. - Is there a helicopter there yet? You can never tell with these state agencies how long it will take to get one there, if at all. Tell christal I'll be there as soon as possible. Thanks, dear. - Is everything okay? - The two-year-old son of my dear friends Randy and christal simpkins has disappeared. - God, that's awful. - It's going to be very difficult terrain to search. A helicopter's their best chance. - Do you think the Atlanta news stations will send one of theirs? - They won't unless they assign a reporter to cover the story. That would be the hard part, to convince them that this is a story they need to cover. We're just too far outside Atlanta to get much attention. - Okay, do you still have your contacts at channel six? I know you did a presidential debate analysis for them once. - Yes, yes, I'm sure I can get one of the producers on the phone. - Okay, we have interns at all the network affiliates. I can call one of them and see if they can put me in touch with their story assignment editor. - Bless you, Teresa. If you get a reporter on the phone, transfer it to my office. And don't take no for an answer. Don't worry, I won't. - Okay. Okay, I'm on my way over. Thank you, Mary. - Christal simpkins' little one has gone missing. There's a search on at their place. I'm going over to help. - I wanna go, too. - Okay, lock the doors. Were closing up. - I think you're the third person to do that. I was the first. - Better safe than sorry. Does Joe like to hide? - No, not unless he's playing hide and seek with his brothers, and they weren't here. - Any little hideaway places he likes to take naps? And I checked 'em all several times. I've already answered all these questions. Everybody's asking me the same things over and over again. I don't understand why you all don't just get out there and find my son. - I understand your frustration, Mrs. Simpkins. Right now, the more information we get, the better. Maybe you'll think of something new after being asked a hundred times. Maybe I'll hear something the other deputies didn't. Sheriff Reeves, these are the parents. - There's no need, deputy, our families go way back. Randy, christal. Guess you all figured my people needed something to do today? - I didn't. I guess my son did. - It's Joe that's missing? - That's right. - Okay, I'm gonna head on over, check what the plan is, and I'll come back and let you know what's what. - Thanks, Tony. - We'll find him for you, christal. Don't you worry. - Thank you. - Deputy. - How embarrassing, our Christmas lights are still up. - That's what you're worried about right now? - No, that's not what i'm worried about right now! What I'm worried about is our son, who would be here right now if you'd done what I asked. - What are you talking about? - I told you to put him in the Van, but you don't ever do anything I say, like taking down the Christmas lights! - I'm sorry, okay! Somebody has to work around here. - Don't even start! That's just your excuse to get away from the really hard work around here. - You think I don't work hard? That's all I ever do, so I can put food on the table, clothes on our kids, and a roof over our head. - I know you work hard, just not at what really matters. - Providing for my family is not what really matters? - Do you think your boys are gonna thank you when they grow up for all the work you did? - I'm gonna go find our son. Hi. Yeah, can you give me a smile? - Okay, let's go through it again. Is there any way that he might have, I don't know, gone to visit some neighbor? - Ma'am, I'm sorry, can I help you? - I'm a friend of the family. What's your name? - I'm Carol fulton. - Okay, hang on just one second. Let me get them through. Follow them up when they go by. Guys, can I help you? - Pop that trunk. Let's get this thing opened. - Hey, there, Tony. - Gary. - Where we at? - I'm ready to get these boys in the field and find that kid. - Let's do it. Lord, christal, come here. - I'm such a failure. - No, you're not. - I lost my son. What kind of mother loses her son? - It's not your fault. Children wander off all the time. Mine have several times. - I can't find him, Carol. He's just vanished. What if I never see him again? I just don't think I can do this. - Yes, you can, because god is right here with you, and he is out there watching over little Joe, and he is going to bring him back home safe to you. - Do you think so? - Yes, I do, if we ask for his help. Let's do that right now. - Okay. - Dear lord, please be with little Joe wherever he is. Please be with these brave men who have come to help, and please be with christal and Randy right now, and bring them comfort and strength. We ask this in your name, amen. - Amen. Thank you. You're right. He's here with US and with Joe. - Of course he is. - Thank you, Carol. Gather around, everyone. Come on in. - Listen up. We're ready to divide you into teams and get you into the field. The description of the boy you're searching for, Joseph simpkins, is posted here, at the command post, along with a current photo. We have divided the search area into sections. Each team will be responsible for an assigned section. Team leaders will check back here every 20 minutes with par. There's several lakes and ponds out there, and there's a manure pit here. Looks for any signs of disturbance, footprints and such, along the perimeter of any and every body of water no matter how small. Got that? Tony. - Most of you all know each other. You know that our two departments have always worked well together but today, we're one department. You got me? That said, it's possible we could find a crime scene out there today. I hope to god that doesn't happen but if it does, the first thing I want you to do is make certain that the boy is, in fact, dead. Back away from the scene, cordon off the area, and report in to US using police code only. Fire rescue is gonna relinquish the scene, and the sheriff's department and the state patrol takes over. Any questions? - No, sir. - Bud's gonna give you your assignments. Good luck. - Okay, guys, the sheriff already has a perimeter established with some of his deputies out there. - Joe! Joseph, can you hear me? Joe! Joe! Joe! - Do they need help? I think... It's my husband. Excuse me. - Mary, he's still missing. - I was headed down to the pits where we dumped the lake debris, and they're filled with water. - I've been meaning to fill those things in. I just haven't had the time. - I've been making some calls. Lots of people have been coming by to help search, plus the sheriff's over at Randy and christal's. - I'm gonna have a look around. If you see anything suspicious in those pits, I'll get the pump. - We figured if you were gonna take the day off, we would, too. - I appreciate that, boys, I truly do. - How can we help? - Just spread out and start looking. - Don't worry, we're gonna find him, all right, boss? - Okay, team three, I want you to head east on gold dust trail, all right? I want you to clear every house up to this point here. Check crawl spaces, storage sheds, everything. Let me know when the area's been cleared. - Let's go. - Chief, chopper's onsite. - This is deputy director baskins. We are onsite requesting where you would like US to begin the search. - Stand by. - Have 'em go a one-mile radius and survey for any areas of interest that might warrant investigation by a ground crew, okay? - The k9 team's arrived but they say with everybody out here, they can't deploy. I told 'em to stand by. We'll just let 'em know if we find a fresh place to search that hasn't been trampled. Whoa! You better listen to me. - Listen, mister... Seargant Bert Smith. - Yeah, whatever. Look, I'm Randy's cousin. His mom called me to help look for little Joe, and that is what I'm gonna do. - I done told you, only search and rescue personnel are allowed in the fields. - I don't see that many of 'em out there, frankly. - It seems to me that if you really wanna find the boy, you'd accept any help you could. How do I know you're related to the family, that you just won't go out there and make matters worse, like get lost, or hurt, or trample over clues, or who knows what else? The fact is I got my orders, sir, and you ain't going anywhere except right back down that driveway. - What I'm gonna do is go through that gate, and if you don't like it, you can shoot me. Deputy Smith. Over here. - The sheriff wants a word with me. I'll tell him how you feel and I'll see what I can do, but you've got to agree you just gonna stay right here while I do, okay? - What's going on, Bert? - Sir, we got a little trouble brewing. We getting flooded with folks that I don't even know who want to jump in and search. I told him polite, but he ain't taking no for an answer. We already got some of 'em out there on their own. - I just got a report that there's folks parking over at the sweetgrass farm and searching on their own. - This could get outta hand real quick. The problem is we don't know who half them folks are and every now and then, you get some wacko showing up and offering to search for a missing kid that doesn't have the purest of intentions. - Well, if we don't let 'em help, things could get real ugly. We could spend just as much time on manpower trying to get 'em to stop searching. - Then Randy and Chris are gonna wonder why we're turning away help. - Well, it is their child. I say we express our concerns to them and see what they think. - My mother-in-law has been on the phone with her church and everyone else she knows. Believe me, that's a lot of people. - It looks like they all showed up. - What do you want US to do, Mrs. Simpkins? - I think they're the answer to a lotta prayers. - All right, have your men bring 'em to the command post. We'll start a sign-up sheet for those who wannna search. We'll integrate 'em with our men. That way we can keep an eye on 'em. - Deputy. Send somebody over to that farm and round up everybody over there who's searching on their own. Tell 'em if they wanna search with US, they gotta sign in here first. - Yes, sir. - Thank you. - Joe! - Let's see if we can hit the top of the grain elevator. Yeah, you can, Joe. Go ahead. I can't. Pretty good. - Shoot, that was nothing, watch this. - This is Randy. Randy,. - No, that bid went in Thursday. Well, I know for a fact because I delivered it myself. - Daddy, watch! - Joe, Joe, stop it, okay, I'm on the phone. What are we gonna do? - All right, you know what, I've got a copy in the office. Give me a few minutes and I'll fax it over to you. Thanks for letting me know. You're a lifesaver. Sorry, guys. Joe, I'll come back and watch you in a minute. - Let's go home. Joe! Joe! Joey! Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe! Joey! Joe! - Sir, if you'd like to help with the search, I'm gonna need you to sign in at the command post. - This is Joe's dad. You okay, Randy? - Yeah. - I'm sorry, I didn't know. - No problem. I'm just, I'm very thankful that you're all here. - You're welcome to join US. - No, no, sir, I'm gonna head back to the house. - If you're sure. Let's continue our grid search. - It'll be okay, Randy. We're here for you, and for Joe. Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe! - Please. - Joe. - Please, god, don't take my son. Please, don't take my son. - I know I haven't been there. I know I haven't spent enough time with him. Please give me another chance to be there. All right, Joe! Joe simpkins draws back! He throws! Touchdown! Number seven, Joe simpkins breaks open for a huge first down! - I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride. - Here's your grandson. Ho, ho. - Please, god, if Joe's alive, just let me know. Give me some kind of a sign that my son is not dead. - Terry. - Thank you, momma. Find everything okay? - Yes, but I heard the worst thing while I was gone. Little Joe is missing. What was that, momma? - The youngest simpkins boy is missing. They must have half the county over there looking for him. - What was that about Joe? That's the boy's name, Joe simpkins. - Well, I guess we better get over there and find him. - You sure, daddy? You just had heart surgery two months ago. - I'm well enough. All right, let's go. - Ed, I know you wanna help, I do, too, but they've got plenty over there, believe me, the sheriff, fire, state patrol. They could use a couple more. Make that three. All right. - Christal, hi, I'm joy, from the church in whitesburg. We've come to help find your boy. - How did you even know? - Your preacher called our preacher, and we decided to get a group up and come on over. - Thank you. What can we do? - Excuse me. - Momma! - You didn't have to. - It was no problem at all. Believe it or not, they closed school early. When principal Ballard found out about Joe, he told US teachers he was headed here and invited US to come with him, and I knew you were gonna be a little too busy to pick up your boys. - Thank you so much. - Is Joe okay? You know your brother. Little Joe is just playing a game of hide and seek with everyone. A very good game. Don't worry, we"re gonna find him. - He's dead. - Hey, don't say that. Your brother is not dead. - He is so. - It's not funny, okay. I don't wanna hear you say such a thing. - Okay. - I did not realize there was gonna be so much activity so if you'd like, I'll take the boys to my place until things quiet down. - That would be wonderful. You sure you don't mind? - Not at all. - Okay, guys, you wanna go to miss Emma Jo's place for a little while? - No, I wanna stay with you. - Does she have video games? - Yes, I do for when my grandkids visit. - All right! - You just be a good boy and go take care of your brother, okay? I love you. You, too, you little knucklehead. Come on. - I'll call you as soon as I know something. Gold dust command, this is 4-0-1. Go ahead, 4-0-1. - We've cleared all the houses here on gold dust trail. Awaiting further instructions. - Roger, 4-0-1, have your men head north across the street. Let's clear the pine grove all the way up to the ward property, over. - That's the last of the houses. Chopper's gonna check the swamp to the west. Nothing yet. We got additional personnel Atv. - That'll help. - Hold on a second. Hey, where you been? - Out looking. - Yeah, I understand what you're feeling, Randy, but I'm gonna need you here. You got information we that might need. It could be crucial. - Okay. - You okay? - Fine. - All right, listen to me. I'm gonna need you to buck up, son. - Buck up? How do I do that, Tony? My head is filled with all these images. My son floating face-down in a pond, suffocating at the bottom of a well, calling to me for help. I'm not there. - I get it. Randy, I do. But if these people think you've given up, they might just do the same thing. They need you to be strong right now. Your son needs you to be strong, you hear me? Even if you gotta fake it, you gotta show that you got hope. Hell, man, we still got several hours of good sunlight left. We got a good shot at finding your boy. - I hear you, Tony. Thanks. Good man, let's go. - Your doctor would kill you if he saw you walking on that torn achilles. - How is she holding up? - See for yourself. - I thought she'd be a wreck. - You coached her in softball. You know how tough she is. - I'm so glad you're here. - I come bringing good news. We've got reporters from channel six and 11 on their way here now, and they're bringing their helicopters. - We're gonna be on the news? - It's a good thing, more eyes in the sky. The more we put the word out, the more people will keep an eye open. - I know you're right. It's wonderful. Thank you. I just feel like such a terrible mom. - Nothing could be further from the truth, and everybody here knows that. - Thank you. - I told you there must be a couple of hundred people out here. - Let US off here. - I'll see if there's anything I can do up at the house. Please be careful. - Okay. - Sir, can we give you a hand? - Sure, just checking for signs the boy mighta fallen in, footprints, that kinda thing. - How's it going so far? - I'm concerned that we haven't found him yet. When a child this age goes missing, the first three hours are crucial. The odds of finding him alive after that drop considerably. - How many hours has he been missing? - Over four. I hate to say this but with all the ponds, the streams, the swamps, and old Wells we got around here, I got a bad feeling that he's laying on the bottom of one of 'em. - You holding up? - Just thinking about the coyote dens I spotted in the woods a couple of weeks back, rattlesnakes, cotton mouths, scorpions, everything else. I used to think this place was so beautiful, god's country. It doesn't feel that way today. Hey, tiger, how you doing, buddy? - Joe get along with your dog? - Yeah, well, not as well as with Cleo, our other dog. Well, not our other dog. We're keeping her for a friend. I was supposed to take her to the pound, but Joe and that dog get along so well, I don't think i'm gonna be able to. - Where's the dog now? - Come to think of it, I haven't seen the dog since Joe disappeared, and she was with him right before he did. You think the dog is with him? - It's a possibility. - Command to all units, be advised that subject was last seen with a medium-sized black dog, labrador mix, answers to the name of Cleo. That's Charles, Lincoln, Edward, ocean. If you see the subject or the dog, report to the command post immediately, out. Deputy, check with that dog's previous owner, and make sure he hasn't wandered on back home, all right? Watch your footing. We got four or five groups already out there, and they're headed back up this way. We're gonna start going from oak grove road, and clear all the way up to the area of the northwest. A team searched that area a couple of hours ago. There's a thousand places for him to hide. He could have easily been missed. Report in every 20 minutes. Good luck. - Hey, hey, can we join you, me and my daddy? - Is he up to it? Yeah, he'll walk you in the ground. - Sure, everybody spread out about five feet, and start combing the area. - Okay. - Hello. Mary. Hi, Sally. I just called to see if there's any word. - Not yet, I'm afraid. Ijust wanted to let you know we have a huge prayer chain going for little Joe. I think every church in the state has one going. - That's, that's just... Are you okay? - I just don't think... I guess my brain isn't functioning properly. I read something recently about possums and the way they play dead when they feel threatened. - Well, they don't really play dead at all. Their little brains just freeze up with fear and they shut down. - I think that's how I feel right now. You just hang in there, Mary, and just try to feel all the love and support that's coming your way, okay? - Thank you. - Hey, Chester, we went ahead and cleared out an area for your media vehicles. - Thank you, sheriff. I've got another question. I noticed some of your k9 units are here. I'm told none of the dogs are in the field. - Yes, sir, that's correct. - Why is that? - It's not like you see in the movies, Chester. Police dogs aren't scent-specific. They can't just pick up one person's scent and track it in a crowd. With all the searchers we got in the field, it's just a waste of time to deploy 'em. - I see. That's a real shame. - What about that woman up in polk county, Tracy sosha. - I know her but, I mean, my k9 officers doubt her dogs can do anything our dogs can't. - Don't you think it's worth a try? I mean it might make christal feel that more is being done, if you understand. - If you think it'll help, I'll be happy to give her a call. - The media has arrived. - Chester Gibson, thank you so much for coming. - It's our pleasure, Mr. Gibson. I just hope we can help. Where can we set up? - The sheriff has got a place right up here. The command post is right up here. You can get a briefing from chief Thomas of fire rescue, and sheriff Reeves, and I'll see if the family is up to granting an interview as well. Good, I'd like to do that as soon as I can. - Of course. Hey, Joe! Joe! Joe! - What you thinking, daddy? - I'm thinking we oughta head this way. - These guys are moving too slow. I think we can do better on our own. - Let's go. - Currently, we have eight search teams in the field, plus numerous officers on atvs. In fact, we have so many searchers, the American red cross set up an aid station to provide food and water for everybody. - It also looks like you have a large number of community volunteers. Is it common that so many people will turn out like this to help look for a missing child? - No. No, I've never seen anything like it before in my life. As a professional, i'm concerned about the number of untrained searchers in the field, but as a human being, as a human being, it kinda restores your faith in the goodness of people, if you know what I mean. That's all, thank you. - Yeah, I got it. I don't want you working in the store, Joe. You're not in class. I want you to be studying or socializing with your classmates. - I just thought Danny could use a hand today. I could always use the extra money. - Don't worry about the money. There'll be plenty of time later to worry about the money, believe me. - I just don't wanna be a burden on the family. - You're not. Sylvia and I are very proud of you, Joe. We want you to enjoy these years. You worked the entire time you was in high school, remember? - Thank you. - Where are you, Joe? - What's that, daddy? - Nothing. I appreciate , little brother. I gotta get. Lockheed doesn't like their supervisors to be late. - Say, they're not really gonna let you build planes people are gonna fly in, are they? - You rascal. All right, what you got? - Who's the old man now, boy? I'll see you in the morning. - All right, see you at home. See you, ed. Get in the car! All right, let's go! - You're thinking about your little brother, aren't you? - Maybe a little. A little. There's always also thinking about where I'd be if I was a boy, where I'd go. When I was little, I used to play back there, around there where four farms come together. That was a lifetime ago, though. - It hasn't changed that much, let's go check it out. - All right, let's go. - Copy, stand by. Copy that, standing by. - The team has found some marks at the edge of a pond in area four. The locals call it grace lake. - That area was searched earlier. They reported nothing. - It's possible the previous team made the marks. - Or they missed them. I have a dive team ready to go. - It's the first lead we've had all day. Go ahead and deploy 'em. We better do it while it's still light. - Bud, be discreet. Have 'em access the pond from the side and use a secure radio channel. If they find out that we're dragging the pond... - sheriff, the chopper needs to return to base to refuel. - Send 'em. - My station has given me clearance for our chopper to assist in the search. - There you go, sheriff, now you got another helicopter. - I'm gonna need to get a deputy on board to coordinate the search. Bert, you know the area. - You want me to cram myself in one of those flying contraptions? It's for a good cause. - I guess you got a point. I hope that thing's got a barf bag. - Be careful what you shoot out there. I've been on almost a dozen of these searches, and they never have a happy ending. - Got it, no close-ups of a two-year-old floating face-down on the 5:00. - At least no close-ups. - Hey, I'm Jack graves. - Sergeant deputy Bert Smith, carroll county sheriff's department. You keep this thing nice and level, and you and I'll get along just fine. Watch that hook! Got it. All right, let's dive. - Bud, we only got about an hour of light left. Let's recall a couple of teams and get 'em equipped for night ops. - Team two and team five, return to gold dust command. Repeat, return to gold dust command. - I don't understand. Why are they recalling the search teams? They haven't even found him yet. - Don't worry, it's routine. They'll be re-deployed. - I am worried. I'm worried to death. Why can't they find him with all these people? My little boy is about to be out in the dark without his momma and... - You think he could be in there? - When I was a kid, I played in these woods. - How could he have gotten past this fence? This bottom wire's electrified. Why would he have even tried? - We've been looking in places that have already been searched since we got here. Nobody's looking in there. - Yeah, for a reason. Yeah, well. - Hell, it's worth a try. Keep it spread out while I get in there, okay? All right. Christal. This is Tracy sargent, her dog cinco. - Thank you for coming. Miss sargent figures our best shot here is to bring cinco in to where Joe's scent is the freshest, namely his room, if that's okay. - Of course. Good luck. Check it. Check it. Very good. - Mommy, look, mommy, look! - Joe. - Good job. How about we? - Yeah. - Yeah, that's a good idea. - Yep. Joe! - I'm okay! You're okay, come here to me, you rascal. I think it's time for tickle war! Are you ticklish right there? Check it. Check it. Very good. - I don't know if christal can take much more. I feel it will kill her if I tell her what I think I have to. - I understand. - I asked sheriff Reeves that if worse comes to worse, if they find Joe and he's... that I be the one to bring that news to christal and Randy. For some reason, I think that that time is coming very soon. I just feel it. - Randy, any news yet? - Not right yet, momma. - Look, it's your dad. - What's wrong? - I'm gonna get the pumps and start dragging those pits by our pond. - But I checked them. - So did I. It don't matter. He could have fallen in and got trapped underneath the surface and never left a trace. Most likely, he was headed over to our place, and we know he never made it, and those pits are on the way. - Daddy! - Yeah! - Found a coyote's den but it's abandoned. You okay? - Fine. - We been at this a while now. What say we head on back. I don't want you to overdo it in here. Let's just go another 10 feet or so. - Okay, go easy. Sylvia. How is he? - I'm waiting to hear from Dr. Paul. All they've told me is that he was in a car crash. Dan said he was running something to the house. A battery charger. I asked him to do it. - It's not your fault. - Yeah. God, please, lord. Let our Joseph be all right, if it be thy will, god, bless you. - I'm so sorry, but there was nothing that we could do. He broke his neck when he was thrown free from the car, and he died before they could get him here. It was probably instantaneous, no suffering if that's any consolation. - I'm coming for you, Joe. I'm coming for you. - What's that? - It's the dog! The black dog, just like the one in the description. I lost him. Hang on. Anything? - I can't see a damn thing. I'll call into. Gold dust command, we have spotted a black dog in the tree line matching the description two miles to the north-northwest - Copy, two miles north-northwest. - You found the dog, that's great. - Can I tag along while you tell the family? Best hold off on that for a minute. The dog's gonna stick with the boy whether he's alive or dead. Let US find out which it is first. - I've got something! - I got movement in the tree line, directly north of our position. Copy, aerial unit. We're converging on your position. - I got the boy! He's coming out. - That don't look right. Command, it's a false alarm. It was the wrong dog and a couple of boys with a bb gun. We'll continue our search pattern. - Copy that. - Thanks. We should go ahead and recall everybody. Give 'em a chance to get back here before dark. You know we just lost our best chance of finding that boy. - I know that, Tony. Once we'ere into night opticals, it goes from finding a needle in a haystack, to finding a needle in a stack of needles! To all teams, return to gold dust command to await further instructions for night ops. Repeat, Of all teams, return to gold dust command. Hey, daddy! We should head back before it gets too dark in here. - Okay. Stay where you are. I'll come to you. - Joe! Teddy! I found him! Hey, Joe, I bet you like tractors, don't you? Would you like to go ride in one? Would you like to go see mommy? Come on, come on! Thank you, lord, thank you! Thank you, lord. Well, I'll be! Hallelujah. You want me to carry him outta here? Yeah, yeah, that's where we're going. - We found him. He's alive. They found little Joe. Good job, great work. Where is he? You okay? Thank you! Ride pawpaw's bike. Ride pawpaw's bike. No, baby, you can't ride pawpaw's bike right now. Ride pawpaw's bike! No, no, no, no, Joe. I'm not letting you go anywhere right now. - Thank you very much. Thank you much. Thank you. I wanna thank god for watching over our boy today, and for ed Walker and his son, Terry. - Moo cows! - What was that, young man? You said something about moo cows? Shoot moo cows. - He was trying to shoot the moo cows. That's how he got lost. She's a really good dog. She stayed with him the whole day. I guess we can't take her to the pound now? - Look out, look out, Joe, for you, all right! Fireman Joe! - You guys, this is ed. This is his son, Terry. - Thank you for finding my brother. - You're welcome. You're welcome, buddy, both of you. Have a good night. I'll call you tomorrow. Hey, bud, later, thank you again. - You okay? - I can't believe he's back. I was convinced we'd lost him, that I lost him. There's something I wanna tell you, that I want to tell him. - Okay. - Will you prray with me? - Of course. - Dear lord, thank you for returning Joe to US, and for giving me a second chance to be a better father and a husband. Lord, I feel like you grabbed me and slapped me, and showed me what's important in life. I promise from now on to put you and my family first in my heart and actions, and to find a way to somehow give back to all those who helped US today. I'm so overwhelmed by your love and so grateful to you. Thank you for giving me a chance to see all that, and for giving me such a wonderful family and wife. In Jesus' name, amen. - Amen. I love you. - I love you. Man, I could use a vacation. - You still wanna go? - Yeah, don't you? - Yes. - I suppose we oughta get a good night's sleep first. - I don't know about you, but I couldn't sleep right now if I tried. Me neither. - Well, the Van is still packed. I'm sorry, Cleo, you can't come with US, girl. You're gonna have to stay here. Mawmaw and pawpaw will take real good care of you. Okay, come on, come on, come on, Cleo!
