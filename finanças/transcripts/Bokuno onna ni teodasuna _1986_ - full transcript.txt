You making fish again? I told you it makes the room stink of fish, didn't I? It's not your room, is it? I don't mind some candles once in a while, but they really don't go well with the smell of dried mackerel. They cut the electricity. - Really? - Really. Poor as a church mouse… I dunno about you, but I can't afford to enjoy being poor. Idiot. You gotta deal with poverty if you wanna live life as you please. Big words from some lazy bones. Giving me life lessons. Aren't you a little young for that, Michiko? I'm already 17, you know! Then isn't it time you start getting serious about things? Why don't you go home? You're graduating next year, rigtht? I just went home. Needed some money. Didn't get any, though. Parents started crying. Well, duh. Shouldn't make 'em cry. Hitomi, are you for real about cleaning up your act? Yeah. Your job fun? A woman who works hard is beautiful. My, my. Look at you. Don't walk around at night by yourself. Oh shut up. You're gonna end up in a ditch, carrying on like you do. Quiet, orphan. Hey, don't overdo it. You're gonna break the glass. Sorry. One, ten, hundred, thousand, ten thousand, hundred thousand… 210,000. Wow… Hey! Naughty! You can't do that. Geez… What are you doing? My poor lil' Linda. Are you being bullied? I am not bullying her. That dog's a shoplifter. Excuse me? My dog would never. - Tell me what she took and I'll pay. - It's not about money. Are you the manager? No, you're a little too cocky for that. What are you doing? Please accept our apologies, madam. - Awful woman! - Apologize. We are very sorry. Forgive us. The scary lady is back. So, so scary. I am not scary. Yer fired! Wake up! Oh, Hitomi. I've got a hangover. - Get me some water. - Get it yourself. Why you gotta be so cold? Get out when you're done. Bye. - Who was that? - Oh… Smelled of liquor. Disgusting. Sorry, I don't know the guy. You always let strangers sleep here? What about her? - Ah, that's… - Another stranger? We agreed that if you didn't have my rent by today you'd leave, right? Ah, yes. But this room's sure taken a beating. Don't you ever clean? Sorry. You're leaving tomorrow, you hear? - Owner, another round! - Sure. How many? - Just one. - Catch. - Owner, I'm returning these. - Alright, thank you. - Owner, pass me another. - Catch. Can I get one, too, owner? Okay but I'm gonna need some collateral. It was never a problem before. You went 'n cleaned up your act, right? Sorry. Don't trust flakey people. But I don't have any collateral… - Wanna lend some money? - Really? Sure. All ya gotta do is go out with me tonight. No way. Don't wanna end up drugged or something. What do you take me for? And where are you now, sir? I see, okay. Hotel Rich, room 402. Well we have about ten girls. Okay. A bright and cheery girl? Sure. The one with the lightest, softest skin… Yeah, we have girls with long hair. Got just the one for you. You only have 20,000 yen? Ah well. (147 USD) Ah, no, I'm sending her over right now. You're gonna love her. Should be there in fifteen minutes. You're welcome. Sanae, Hotel Rich, room 402. - Okay. - Make sure he pays first. I will. Oh, Hitomi. Where've you been? Lend me some money. - No way. - Come on. Nothing but trouble comes from lending friends money. Oh, you looking for work? Oh yeah, what happened? Michiko was here before. - She on the job? - Yeah. Hey, you wanna hop in the shower with me? I'll wash your back for ya. No? Ah man, I'm dying here. High school girl, huh? You're killin' me. - What is it? - Come with me. - Hey, that hurts. - What are you thinking? - What's going on? - She's my friend. I didn't ask for a threesome, but… sure! Pervert. Sigh… I thought if I just put up with it for two hours, I'd be able to pay our rent. Worry about your body instead of rent. You're that concerned about me? It's 'cause I love you. But what are we gonna do? Living life seriously… Maybe you just gotta be craftier… Anyone there? Hello? Anyone? Hm? Hey, wait, who's there?! Thieves, duh. Azabu 3 for HQ, come in, over. - This is HQ. Over. - No movement from the suspect tonight. Gonna call off surveillance and head back. - Over. - Understood. Over. Thief! Thief! Thief! Stop them! - What? - "What"? Here. Oh! Louis XIII, pricey stuff. Cops! Cops! Don't move! Did a young woman come in here? I see… Hey. - Arrest the lot of them. - Hey… Anything wrong, officer? - No, nothing. Keep moving. - Ah, okay. Thanks. Yes, please keep it moving. A friend? Does it matter? Who are you? A lawyer. I could be of use to someone like you. Take it. Where you going? Here's fine. Let me off. Feel free to reach out to me. - She's not here. - Do you know anywhere she could be? Hmmm, I don't know. I see. Okay, thanks. I'm on it, but the Yonekuras' land is spread all over Japan. Can't expect too much from it as real estate. What? Yeah. That's right. I'll bring the file over tomorrow. Yes. Bye. What's up? Here. Thanks, for saving my ass. You stole this, right? Just tell me if you don't want it. No, I'll take it. Come in. Alright, let's eat. Not hungry. Hot pot's no good if you have to eat it by yourself. Join me. Sorry. I get a lot of phone calls. This is Kashima Law Office. I'm currently not in, so please leave a message after the tone. I will contact you as soon as I receive your message. This is Miyamoto, I called you the other day. I wanted your opinion on something. So I went back home yesterday, and I called my husband to confront him, but a woman picked up. Said she was his subordinate… This isn't very dinner appropriate, is it? Telling me all about how shamelessly he's been cheating on me… How is it? - A little bland. - That so? Here, help yourself. Hm. That's a bit better. A rotten apple with a good sense of taste, huh? - Shut up. - What? You let your guard down and suddenly you lose all reserve, huh? Wouldn't be much of a delinquent if I held back, right? A real delinquent doesn't call herself one. Don't you have a home? Parents? Dunno. Never met 'em. What's up with the friendly act all of a sudden? I'm the same way. Don't have any parents. You're not the only one. Guess there are others out there taking things seriously. Got a job? No matter what I do, it never works out. Because you're selfish, right? I don't understand why anyone would wanna be a lawyer. Lawyers exist to serve others. That sounded pretty cool. There are those who are used, and those who use others. Guess you haven't realized that yet. You tired? - Sofa fine? - Yeah. What's your name? Hitomi Kuroda. - I'm turning off the light. - Okay. Pajamas. Not that I mind it, but… Isn't this more the kinda place you'd bring your lover? It is? Yeah. Mr. Kashima. Wait here. Nowhere good left, huh? Looks like it was all bought up when you were in the US, You'd think a guy gets tired of fish… The land owned by the main family is under Susumu's name now. It'll take some time if you want to put in a claim to reduce the heir's shares. I can't wait. - You understand, right? - I do. "I can't wait any longer." "I've got a job to do." "And what do I do?" "Give me time." You didn't have to go and break up with her in front of me. Ms. Hitomi? Ms. Taeko Yonekura. Hello. What were you looking at? Ah, just admiring the boats. You wanna ride one? Ms. Taeko's looking for a tutor for her kid brother Susumu. Wanna give it a go? Tutor? I didn't even finish school. Don't worry, he's only in the first grade. It's a good opportunity to start fresh. Aren't rich people all terrible? That island over there's called Mukushima. The Yonekuras own it. They've got 18 more resorts like it. You ever known anyone that rich? It's getting cold, let's go back. Okay. Daizo Yonekura died on that island during a fishing accident three months ago. Seven year old Susumu succeeded him as the 24th patron of the Yonekura family. The Mizutanis have been serving the Yonekuras for generations, so they're now looking after Susumu. What about Ms. Taeko? Ms. Taeko is only his half-sister. She also has no interest in living here. Why? She wants to keep working in the US. - What does she do? - She's an "Artist Coordinator." It seems she's got a big event in New York at the end of the year. You can't tell from looking at her. Looks can be deceiving. Especially with women. - Sorry I'm late. - Where's Ms. Hitomi? Ah, she's waiting for you. Ms. Hitomi. I'm so glad you came! Thank you! - Thank you for having me. - Kiyo! Kiyo, come here. This here is Ms. Hitomi Kuroda. This is Mrs. Kiyo Mizutani. She's been with the family forever. Pleased to meet you. Could you show her to her room? So you studied English Literature at Tokyo Women's University? Yes. If you think this is some cushy part-time job you're wrong. Yes… Your room is on the second floor. Ah, yes. And please do not enter any of the other rooms. What happened? Susumu? - You okay? - Yeah. I'm not that easily scared. Good morning! - Ah, good morning. - Young sir is waiting. - What about school? - He hates it. Which is why you are here. We're expecting a lot from you. Susumu, can I come in? I'm coming in, okay? You can't just enter someone's room, y'know. Sorry… Wow! No touching! You'll ruin them. So you like fishing? Ah, um… I'll be your study partner starting today. Name's Hitomi Kuroda. Nice to meetcha! You sure gave me a scare yesterday. So, why don't you go to school? Ya sure are nosy for a tutor. "Ya"? What are you getting scared about? Yes. The money will come in by the middle of the month, so keep getting the performers. And don't worry, I'm back at the beginning of next month. Bye. Thanks. - Hitomi, hurry. - Coming. What're you doing, Hitomi? Come on! Yes. That one right there! Quick, catch it! There, there! That one! There! Get it! Nice job, Hitomi! Teacher, you're… - Eisaku! - Yes. - I wanna eat it! - Huh? The fish? Turn it into sashimi! Thank you for waiting. Ah I don't want this. You take it, Hitomi. I'm done. Make sure not to leave anything. The master loved his fish dearly, so consider it an honor. I get that you wanna try your best to try and please Susumu, but don't overdo it. I told Kiyo that I fully trust you with Susumu. So from here on out just do what you think is right, okay? - Maybe I should tell you. - Hm? I've been a delinquent since I dropped out of middle school, and the cops are after me. Mr. Kashima saved me. I thought I could make this work, but... I guess I'm not cut out to be a tutor. I feel like I'm gonna choke on my own lies… Mr. Kashima already told me. - Really? - Yeah. I mean, he's the family lawyer. There's no hiding anything. I figured it'd do Susumu good to stray from the path a bit… Like you, Ms. Hitomi. It's 'cause you're different. I wouldn't have done this if you were just a normal college student. I wanted a girl who didn't dilly-dally. - Dilly-dally? - Yeah. So feel free to just be yourself. Susumu. Apologize. You did a bad thing, so apologize. I'll get mad. How could I know your face was gonna be there?! You've got a big mouth. Come here. Let me go! Quiet. Lemme go! Why don't you go live with the turtles from now on? Come here. You gonna be good? Learn your lesson? - Yeah alright. - I wonder. What's with that look? I asked if you learned your lesson. And I said yeah alright, didn't I?! What are you doing?! Have you completely lost it?! Come… Y-young sir. Get out of there. Okay… Poor child… Go home! I'm going to tell Mr. Kashima all about you. Take me back home already. You'll go back to Tokyo and what? Be a delinquent again? Sure. So long as I don't have to be in this stuck-up place. - Stick with it. - Why? You're a spoiled brat! Why did you come here? Didn't you want a fresh start? Why are you so set on me being here? Would you be in a bad spot if I left all of a sudden because you were the one who introduced me to Ms. Taeko? You're afraid of that happening, so you'd rather just keep me here? Go ahead, hit me. We have no reason to fight. Remember what I said, about those who use others? Think about that. Persevere. Okay? Mr. Kashima. We should get going. Sorry! I wanted to give you more time, but we're gonna be late. The party in Tokyo starts at seven. Hang in there. Good luck! You can do this. Come on, come on, come on. What are you doing, Hitomi? Shouldn't we study? You wouldn't understand. - You quitting? - Yeah. - Going back to Tokyo. - Why? - Everyone hates me. - Hitomi. And stop calling me by my first name! Hitomi! Yo! Don't pretend like I'm a stranger. Look, it's me. Oh my god, what are you doing here? I organize parties now. I think I've really got it this time. This thing cost me a lot of money. - No good? - No good. Toru, meet Hitomi. Hey. You know any stupid rich folks 'round here that are into banquets or anything? What are you thinking? As if! I shoulda known. Anyway, now that you're here… Gimme a ride back to Tokyo. - Tokyo? - Yeah. Me too! Hey, you sure about goin' to Tokyo? That was a lie. We're just goin' on a ride, that cool? Sure, I don't mind. What's this? - Bait. - Can I see? - Kid, you wanna go fish? - Really? Sure thing, we got a good spot for it. River nearby 'n everything. It rocks. I got one! They're late! I gotta make a call, okay? Wanna avoid trouble. - What are you doing? - Stop that. What is it? We're... kidnapping the kid. You in? Hah… You're joking, right? What's this? Read it out loud. - "We have kidnapped…" - Louder. "We have kidnapped Susumu." "We want 30 million yen for his return." "Talk to the cops, and he dies." Was this always the plan? So are you in? Look how many I caught, Hitomi! - Wait. - What? Toru will do whatever I tell him to do. Ow, that hurts! Use your head. Just gonna let those rich fuckers keep using you? What are you thinking? Team up with us. This is gonna work. Alright. Well? Ms. Hitomi and the young sir were seen getting into a weird car sometime around noon. A weird car? This is the Yonekura family. We kidnapped Susumu. Ms. Hitomi! We want 30 million yen for his return. Talk to the cops, and he dies. From Ms. Hitomi? No, don't call the cops. Don't do anything until I get home, got it? Hey. - You make the call? - Yes. Get rid of those two yet? No. I wanted to talk to you about that. What is it? Can we not let Hitomi join us? Yo, where you been? Where are they? Second floor. What were you doing?! Didn't I tell you to stand guard?! Hitomi's fully on board with the plan. Said she wants to help any which way. So please. Goddammit, they got away! They got away!! Don't worry about. I'll definitely find them. Stop! Stop!! Hitomi! Why are you running?! Show yourself! Hitomi! Where are they? - Let's go. - Where? All rivers leads back to civilization. If we just keep going down, I'm sure we'll end up somewhere. Don't look! A station! - What's wrong? - Shush. Let's go. Loooser! I don't wanna go back home already. But everyone's worried back home. We should at least call. Attention. The express train to Shinjuku is now arriving at platform two. Kobuchisawa, Kobuchisawa. Please transfer for the Koumi line. Thank you for traveling with us. This is the express train to Shinjuku. We will be departing shortly. Please mind the closing doors. Our next stop will be Kofu. May I see your boarding pass? Ah, two for Shinjuku, please. Your boarding pass? Ah, I didn't have time to buy tickets at the last station, so… - Oh… One adult? - No, the kid is with me, too. - Oh? - Yes. Let's see, two travelers, one child… That'll be 7,200 yen, please. (53 USD) Hey, turn around for a sec will ya. - What are you doing? - Huh? Let's see… I'm terribly sorry that I let this happen while you were away. - You hear anything since? - No, not yet. And you didn't alert the police, right? No. - What about Kiyo? - She's waiting by the phone. This is Yonekura family. Hello, it's Hitomi. Do you realize what you're doing? Ah… I can explain… I don't care. Just let me talk to the young sir. Talk quick, I don't have a lot of money. Kiyo, we need money. I'm sorry, please understand. Fine. 300 million, right? - Where should I bring it? - 300 million? Or 500. Or 600. I don't care how much it is, I'll bring it. Just tell me what you want… Don't you dare hurt the young sir! Hello? Where are you now? Um, in Shinjuku, but… Ah, I'm out of money. If you go to Roppongi… Now what? What happened? They think I kidnapped you. Did you? No! Ah, sorry, could I borrow 10 yen? Sure. Ah, thanks so very much. Miss. Let's just call the police already. No. I still trust that girl. If we escalate things now she might kill herself and take Susumu along with her. You were at fault for bringing a girl like that here in the first place… Kiyo! I don't know. what kind of relationship you and father had, but… Father is dead. You are nothing more than hired help. Don't forget your place. Hitomi, I'm hungry! I know, I know. I'll get you something to eat soon, so be patient. I can't go on anymore. Look, I'm hungry and cranky, too. Suit yourself. … please leave a message after the tone. I will contact you as soon as I receive your message. Are you still not back? It's Hitomi. I'm at a modelling agency called USO. The number is… - Stop that. - What? I don't want cops crawling around here. So don't make any weird phone calls. - Did something happen? - Yeah. Because of you 'n Michiko. That customer ratted you out. Do you not even remember? You got some nerve, bringing a kid here… - Let me try one more number. - Where? - Nagoya. - Nope! No long-distance calls! Geez… Just get outta here already! Really… Fine. Cheapskate. Hey! No omurice for that kid. Enough mooching. Oh, Hitomi. Where were you? Hotel. Can you lend me some money? Nope. Where was Michiko staying again? Said she's working at a factory in Itabashi. Oh yeah. Thanks. See ya. Omurice! Let's go eat. Really? You got money? - Right here. - Nice! Hey! Give that back. Look, I'm flat broke, so if we could just have 500 yen… - No. - Please! - No. - Please, I'm begging you. Have some self-respect. But I'm asking you! - Give it a rest, I said no! - But we only need 500… - You really need to let this go! - But I'll pay you back! - No! - Come on! Hey! Aah! Please, stand back! Stand back! This is mine! Did I scare ya? Not really. But don't joke around like that, okay? Sorry. But y'know, this is kinda exciting, isn't it? - I guess. - Right? Oh yeah, got this for ya. Kinda old, though. Ah, thanks! Oh, he sleeping? Seems like it. - Cute. - You think? Yeah. Oh yeah, could I use your phone? Sure. In the office. Yonekura speaking. Ah, it's Hitomi. Where are you? - A friend's place. - I see. I trust you, so don't worry. Ah, okay. I can come over there tomorrow if you want. Could you tell me where you are now? Ah, it's actually kinda hard to explain, so… Yes. Yes. Ah, yeah. So 9AM in front of the art gallery in Jungu? Okay, got it. See you then. Who was that on the phone? None of your business. Work-related. My apologies. Let go! Hitomi, let's go. H-hey, wait… That hurt, man… That guy doesn't give up easily… I've been wondering, though… What? - That dude… - Yeah? The fact he knew where we were… Don't you think it's strange? And we never even saw that Taeko woman. You think maybe that man was hired by Taeko to try and kill you guys? Haha… But why? Money, what else? Ransom's 300 million. That's chump change to someone like Ms. Taeko. So I think she's gonna give it to that guy after he's done the deed. Can I get 100 yen? Don't you have any money, Susumu? I have some in the bank, but not on me. Check out this guy… - How much? - Five billion yen. It's me… Hitomi! Yo! Where the hell have you been?! Kanazawa. Job took longer than I thought. What happened? Geez… I don't even know where to start… Calm down. Have a seat. There are people out there trying to kill us. Me 'n Susumu were kidnapped. And I was made a scapegoat for Susumu's kidnapping. How is Susumu? - He's fine. - I see. Do you not believe me either, Mr. Kashima? No, I do. Let's just call the Yonekuras. - We can't. - Why not? The real perp is Ms. Taeko. What? Susumu's got five billion yen to his name. But you already know this, right? Ms. Taeko wants that money. Don't be stupid. In property sure, but not actual funds. Who is it? Police. Go to the bedroom. - Tsuyama from Tokyo PD. - Miyagawa. Ah, hello. Mr. Kashima, do you know a Hitomi Kuroda? - Ah, yes. - Do you know where she is? No, I've been away for work. Ah yes, that's right. We've been here many times, but you were never home. I see… Something happen to her? She's involved in kidnapping case. - Really? - Yes. There's also been an accident that might be related. Have you read today's paper yet? Ah, no. I see. Well, I would like to ask you more questions, so would you mind coming to the station? Okay. (Two unidentified male bodies) Let me just put my things away and then I'll come over right away. I see. - What do you think? - It stinks. You wanna keep an eye on him? I really didn't do anything. I know. Now what? You said some people were out to kill you, right? What kind of people? What kind… He just keeps showing up wherever we go. Susumu's somewhere safe, right? One more time! Come on, I've already put 1,000 yen in this. (7 USD) I'll pay you back! Okay, but you're paying interest, so I want 100,000 yen. (740 USD) Greedy! - I'll kidnap ya! - Okay already! So one million then? (7400 USD) Really? Okay, let's play. Yay! - Get ready! - Bring it! So the boat leaves at 9? Could you make a stop at Mukushima? I see. Okay. Thank you. You remember Mukushima, right? Board this boat, and you'll be able to go back. Just hide out there for a while. What about you? For the moment, I'll head to the Yonekura place and see where we're at. - Is that okay? - What do you mean? The police… It's not me they want, it's you. Take this. I'll vouch for your innocence. I don't understand anything anymore. Stay strong. It's all I've been doing. Don't cry. Take Susumu and go. I need to hear you say yes. Yes. Could you lead the way? Well are you leaving or not?! Sorry. There's some trash caught in the duct. Please wait until I've sorted it, okay? Always the same shit… Geez, late again… It's always something with that boat. You goin' to Mukushima, too? If you want we can take you there on our boat. Oh yeah, sure! Be quicker that way. You by yourself? Never mind. Too much trouble if there's a guy. Thank you for waiting! The boat is fixed, so we'll be leaving. I… don't like fishing. Me neither. On my signal, I want you to run. I wanna go with you. Just do as I say. Okay? What're you doing? Yo, let her go, old man! You wanna start some shit?! Ow!! Bastard!! Motherfucker! Yeow!! Hold on tight. You… You know the way to Mukushima, Susumu? Yeah. Do you know which direction it is? It's too dark to tell. But is it close? Yeah. - Let's wait for the morning. - Okay. You scared, Susumu? I'm fine, as long as you are here. You've really warmed up to me, huh? Sleepy? Just a little cold. Hitomi, you kinda smell. Sorry, I'm a little sweaty. No, it's a nice smell. Susumu, wake up. Is that the island? Okay, let's go. That's my ship! Maybe it's Mr. Kashima? We did it! I got a fishing pole! You just won't die, will you? What happened to that two-bit assassin? He's dead. It's 'cause he surrounds himself with losers. You really ruined my plan. Let's go. This'll knock you out cold. You'd drown if you fell in the water unconsciously. I'll see to it you really die this time. Stop! Leave Hitomi alone! Mr. Kashima! I don't know how to stop it! What?! I can't hear you! I can't hear you… She's dead. I guess there really are those who are used, and those who use others. I was being used this entire time. It's over now. - Is it? - Yeah. So give it another go. How? Trust me. You won't betray me, Mr. Kashima? No. If you do I'll kill you. Okay. I'm serious. Do you think Susumu will follow us? I don't like kids, though. And I don't like old men. I guess that's that then. What about Susumu? He'll just remain an orphan. Poor kid. Can't be helped. I wonder… Kashima… What is the meaning of this, Kashima?! I see. You jumped ship. Mr. Kashima! Don't come… D… Don't c-… Don't come… Hey, more people showed up. Good guys? Bad guys? Which? Sons of bitches!!! Stay back! Stay back!! Stay the hell back!!! Hitomi? Sis?
