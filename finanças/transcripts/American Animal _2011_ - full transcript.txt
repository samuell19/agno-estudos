AND WHEN THEY CAME TO THIS GREAT, GREAT NATION, THE MOST FERTILE AND PROMISING NATION IN ALL THE LAND, THEY KICKED OUT THE BARBARIC RED MAN, FOUGHT OFF PRIOR OPPRESSORS, RID THEMSELVES OF THE TYRANNY OF DIRTY KINGS, AND INSTILLED THE LONGEST-LASTING AND MOST PERFECT FORM OF GOVERNMENT, FULL OF INTRICATE CHECKS AND BALANCES TO ENSURE ITS SHELF LIFE. THEY CREATED FREE MARKETS AND CAPITALISM SO THAT NORMAL PEOPLE, PEOPLE LIKE YOUR FAMILY, MY FAMILY, COULD BECOME RICH AND WEALTHY, AND THEY DID. THE SYSTEM FUCKING WORKED. YEAH? AND WE RID OUR PEOPLE OF OPPRESSIVE INSTITUTIONS LIKE SLAVERY, STRUCK DOWN LEGISLATION THAT GIVES EVERYONE THE RIGHT TO DO ANYTHING WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF THE LAW. WE CURED HORRIFIC AILMENTS. WE MADE VEHICLES, OKAY, THAT RUN ON THE EARTH'S NATURAL RESOURCES THAT TAKE US RAPIDLY FROM PLACE TO PLACE TO FUCKING PLACE. AND THEN WE CONQUERED AIR AND WATER AND LAND AND FUCKING OUTER SPACE, OUTER-FUCKING-SPACE, MAN. OUTER-FUCKING-SPACE. WE REALLY DID. WE WENT TO FUCKING MARS. AND THEN... AND THEN, WE CREATED THESE LITTLE FUCKING MACHINES THAT FIGURE THINGS OUT FOR US... COMPUTERS, THE INTERNET, TELEVISION, CELL PHONES...
