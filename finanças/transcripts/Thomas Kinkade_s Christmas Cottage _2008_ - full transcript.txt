I want that shoulder. You want more? All right. Pat's waiting down there. Your brother can wait. He gets to see you this entire holiday. I told you, Hope. I'll drive up to Marin Christmas Night. Okay? Promise. Nothing will stop me. Like every Christmas story... this one's about new life in the dead of winter... but I didn't know that at the time. I was just a college kid... coming home for vacation with my brother Pat. It was 1977. My hometown of Placerville... is up in the foothills of the High Sierra. It's not that far from Berkeley as the crow flies. It was just another world away for me. You see, Christmas in Placerville never changed. Every year, I painted the scenery for the church pageant. And every year, Mom took the children's choir... up to the mountains to listen to the wind in the trees. What are you doing here? Oh, my beautiful boys. Our neighbor, Mr. Rosa... knew every shred of gossip in town. Jupiter! He's German, you know! Jupiter, stop kissing Tom. Hi, Mr. Rosa. Thanks. Tom. Here, Pat. How are ya? I'll get that thing running yet, Maryanne. I'll go look at it. You should know, that big Thanksgiving rain... my house weathered fine. I keep it in mint condition. It's all in the upkeep. But your mom, the roof leaked something terrible. Then the water pipe froze. It burst and... Water damage, huh? She didn't tell us. Maryanne wouldn't have told you. You know how your mother is. Yeah. You know what? Thanks for sharing, Mr. Rosa. You know, with you boys off at school... and then she's all alone... but she still teaches the kids how to sing... and she sews all the Christmas pageant costumes... and, oh, she's got pep, your mom. Yeah, mucho pep. You boys should get on the stick for her. She doesn't spill her own beans. So you spill them for me. Well, it needs oil for one thing. You know, Mr. Rosa... if you ever did get the truck fixed... you wouldn't have anything to gossip about, would you? Come on, guys. I gotta get supper over to Glen. - Thanks, Mr. Rosa. - See ya, Mr. Rosa. Sometimes life moves in mysterious ways... and sometimes there's no mystery at all... like when Glen Wesman built his studio... across the field from us. Having a famous artist next door... was like God's finger pointing me toward painting. All through high school... Glen taught me what it means to be an artist. Glen? Close the damn door. Glen, it's Tom. It's cold in here. Why would you leave the door open? Where on earth are you? In the corner... like Little Jack Horner. What? Come in. I'm learning Latin. A dead language... for the dead. Maleficent crap, eh? They're not done. Some things are better left undone. I can't capture her. Can't paint the loss. My hands won't cooperate. Don't get old. That's the sum of my wisdom at this advanced age. Don't get old. Don't... get... Oh, damned hand. Nothing works the way it used to. Let me get that. - Write. - Yup. "Don't get old." Pin it up. How's your work? I'd like to see what you've been painting. I feel lost, really. Here. 'Cause I've been doing a lot of, uh... a lot of expressionistic stuff lately. That will get you lost very quickly. Don't reduce art to something that's about the artist. Art isn't about the artist. It's about life. Life... beauty... Iove... emotion. Art should bring emotion that can topple tyranny. I haven't forgotten, Glen. Are you gonna try this one again? We were in Paris before the war. And we would picnic along the Seine. You and Nicole? A little wine, some bread by the water. She liked the simple things. I lay back on the grass and looked up. The light played through the trees... touched her. You must see the summer light in Paris. It surrounds the leaves, holds them somehow. If there were a God... that light would be like his hand... holding the whole world together. If I could paint that... Yeah, I bet that art dealer in San Francisco... would be very happy. Sidney. You know, a new Glen Wesman would be worth a lot of money. Sidney always tries to inspire me. "Call Sidney. "Tell him to go to hell." You like Sidney. Do I? You always said you did. What was I writing? You know, don't even... Don't even bother writing it down, Glen. I bet you'll remember to tell him to go to hell... when you see him. Yes. I shall recline here like an Oriental potentate... and then try once again to capture Nicole... record the loss. Nicole... Want to top things off with tea? Fresca? Some other fine beverage? No. FINAL NOTICE Mom, what is this? - Nothing. - Nothing? Bank says they're foreclosing, Mom. Tom, this is my business, not yours. Let me see. I'll figure it out. I have until New Year's... to come up with the back payments. $3,151... and 39 cents. This is due in two weeks. How can they do this? They have already extended me countless times. I've spoken to them. There's nothing more they can do. Mom, how could you fall this far behind? Why didn't you tell us, Mom? Stop. You are my boys. I'm supposed to take care of you... not the other way around. We're gonna lose the cottage. Tom? Oh, I was so close to being asleep. No, you weren't. Okay. I wasn't. You know how I used to fall asleep? It was looking at that drawing of Dad... and dreaming about when he'd come back. Babies. On her own. I remember Mom told me I was the man of the house. I'm not gonna go see Hope. I'm gonna stay here and get a job... and work over the break. You and Hope are like... pretty serious? She'll have to understand. We can't leave Mom like this. Yeah, okay. Me, too. I'll find something, too. Some job. Yeah. Good. Trade ya. You're on vacation. You shouldn't be getting jobs. Yeah, but, Mom, you have a job. You go to work every day. Why shouldn't we? This isn't right. Living like this? You need help. No. Your job is to focus on school... and when you come home, you're on vacation. So... relax. Enjoy yourselves. Pancakes, anyone? Blue box. Thanks for the job, Big Jim. I don't know much about electricity... but I'm gonna work real hard. Well, we're gonna have to, Pat... because these people over here never sleep. I gotta tell ya, they've been trying to top me for 25 years. Your move, Big Jim. You're pathetic, Gunderson! You and your uptight, beady-eyed wife! You think you can top me? I'm Mr. Electricity in this town. Watch this. I built this myself, Pat. Does that go any faster? No. Don't give in to him. He called me beady-eyed in front of the neighbors. Right there, that's why I need your help. They're bitter, ugly people, Pat. Sadists at heart. Keep your cat off my yard! I found a hairball in my manger! You don't have a manger! Yeah, you don't have a manger. I hate that cat. Come on, let's go blow up Mrs. Claus. I do too have a manger. I got everything. Ernie, hey. Hey. Little Thomas Kinkade... all the way from college. Look at you. Jeez. Take a seat. Give this man a Pepsi-Cola, will ya? Sure. Thanks. You know, um... I was actually looking for you... because I wanted to talk to you about finding a job. You know, just something over the holidays. A job, huh? - Yeah. - Right, work. - Yeah. - Employment. You're in Placerville, son, and I can tell... you're digging for gold, aren't ya? Let me tell you something. I'm digging for gold, too. Tourist gold. Who do you think's gonna buy the Haggar slacks... at the Round Tent? Who's gonna buy the cowboy hats at Arian's? Any thoughts? Tourists. Tourists, exactly. But tourists who are gonna be coming... to the Christmas tree capital of the world, baby. Yeah, sounds good. So... Sounds good? No, no, no. It sounds great. I got KRGA coming in from Sacramento. They're gonna cover the pageant and the tree lighting. We're gonna be on TV screens... from the capital all the way to the foothills. We're gonna be going on around 4:30 in the afternoon... so it'll probably still be a little light out. But that's okay. We're gonna be the lead-in to "Match Game." So one minute, people are gonna be watching me... and the next minute, they're gonna be watching Gene Rayburn. It's almost gonna be like Gene and I are friends. And, if that goes well... next year, we're prime-time. Wow. So... Hello there. Oh, hi, honey. It's nice to see you again. It's nice to see you. Thank you. Ernie. Tanya. Such an exciting time of year, isn't it? Yes, it is. Lovely. I just can't wait to run for Miss Placerville again... and throw the switch on that Christmas tree. Tanya, you ran in 1974, and you won. I know. You can't run again. You gotta give somebody else a shot. But no one ever did turn on a tree... the way I turned on a tree, now, did they... Ernie? You know, Tanya... when those photos came out... as president of the Chamber of Commerce... I got phone calls night and day... not to mention the organized protests in the street. I really don't think we want to go down this road again. I'm just telling you. That was art... and this is discrimination. I'm sorry. You just can't run again. You are not the boss of me. Yes, but I'm president of Chamber of Commerce. Yeah, well, I've got friends in this town, too. I'm not some Little Orphan Ernie. I mean, Annie... Ernie. You know what I mean. I don't... Goodbye, sunshine. Tommy... everybody wants a piece of this action. So, do you have any jobs open? No, I do not. It's been very slow. No tourists here. That's exactly why we gotta promote this place. Like with this mural? Yes. Yes, exactly like with this mural. Oh, Placerville at Christmastime. If Charlie could just get it finished. And if he could learn how to paint. You know, he's a damn good letterer... but other than that, you really can't ask... It's Main Street, the Christmas tree? I can paint this. Really? Yes. Well, now, you know... I want it like Norman Rockwell. I mean, I want this to make us proud of our hometown. That's a tall order. Oh, now, come on, you're not gonna get... all high-tone Berkeley on me, are you? None of that social commentary stuff, right? I mean, this is the back of a store. This is not a museum. You understand that? Of course. Yeah? - Yeah. - All right. Well, let's say 500 bucks if it's done by Christmas Eve. You got a deal. Yeah? Deal? All right. How was work? Oh, it was fine. Filing claims is filing claims. How about you guys? Any luck? We are both on the job. All of us Kinkades are workin' Joes now. Oh, that's great! That is great! How about we go home and celebrate... with some leftover spaghetti? All right. Little Joe's. Hi, Dad. T-Bone! How's it hangin', son? Good, Dad. So, listen... it looks like I'm gonna be in Placerville the whole holiday... and I thought you might like to come up. Kinkade! Is that half-pepperoni done yet? Comin', Skip. Dad... It'll be right up, sir. - Dad... - I'm gonna get that kid. I've seen managers come and go, son... but Big Bill sticks. Someday I'll own this joint. Cash in my U.S. war bonds, and I'll buy this place. And I will watch with glee... as that pimply-faced jerk falls to his knees... as dear old Dad is anointed with the Little Joe's pizza crown! Dad, he's nineteen. He's wet behind the ears. Hey, so, you can really come up? It's kind of an emergency. Chick problems, huh? You need a pinch-hitter, son? Look, I can explain it all when you get here, okay, Dad? Hey, I'll be there for you. Don't you count out your old Pops. No, sir. 500 bucks is 500 bucks. Did you ever do a painting you didn't believe in? It's kinda funny you ask. Actually, I just took on a job... doing this ridiculous Christmas mural of Placerville... for 500 bucks. Ridiculous. Yeah, I know. A mural of Placerville. It's your chance to illuminate where you live... to inspire your neighbors. Do you think because they aren't sophisticated... they don't deserve your best art? No, it... That mural can record the people you love for posterity. It could change the way they see themselves. Art crosses all borders, surpasses all languages. It's a place where we are one family. And if you are willing, really... to see with your eyes and your heart... one image can change lives. You can introduce men to their souls. You can bring that to this town. You have that power. Give your very best always. Always the finest your heart has. Okay. It's the only way an artist knows. Okay, Glen. Humpty-Dumpty sat on a wall. Humpty-Dumpty had a great fall. All the king's horses... and all the king's men... couldn't put Humpty... Humpty-Dumpty. Glen wasn't the only one grieving. My mother was always there to comfort everyone. Like Butch, the owner of the Hangtown Saloon. Are you gonna go over there before Christmas? Yeah. Well, his pine tree has shot up another couple of inches. I love the smell of that tree. And the air today, it's just so fresh and so clean. That war, it's still taking its toll. Wars never end. Just... Just the lives of the soldiers who fight them. She's panting awfully hard. She does that all day long. Bulldogs have respiratory problems. You should really have her checked out. Problems, really? Well, I will. Thanks, Maryanne. I owe you a beer. I owe you more than that. Stay, boy. Stay, Jupiter. Down. I'm sorry, Tom. I always forget the German word for "sit." It's "sitten sie" or something. He'll respond to German. Sitten sie. Jupiter... sit. Come on, Jupiter. I know you think I'm a busybody. Am I okay with you? Yeah. Of course you are. Okay. Come on, Jupiter. Schnell. No, no, no, no, no! Stoppen sie! Stoppen sie! Come here! Stoppen sie! "And it came to pass in those days that"... No, no. More bass. "And it came to pass in those days... "that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus... "that all the world should be taxed"? Wow. Psst. Hey, that's too much spirit gum. The bottle says "generously." Yeah, but... Oh, yeah? Who died and made you Max Factor? Please let her do it, Evelyn. Ernie won't let her be Miss Placerville again. She'll be fine in the role... especially with your brilliant direction. Why doesn't Mary have any lines? She's the key role, Tanya. Without Mary, there'd be no Jesus. Mary was a beautiful woman, Tanya. You'll be great. Besides, we need your star power. - Hey, Pastor. - Oh. Guess what. I'm gonna be Mary. The Vir... The Vir... The Blessed... Well. Evelyn! Did you want two humps... on the camel? You know what? I'll... "And so it was that while they were there... "the days were accomplished... "that she should be delivered. "And she brought forth her firstborn son... "wrapped him in swaddling clothes... "and laid him in a manger... "because there was no room in the inn." Joy to the world The Lord is come Let Earth receive her king... - Oh, damn it to hell! - What? Break's over, everyone. Let's get started. Places, please. Come along. - Come on, kids. - Come along. Come along, hurry up now. Madeline, don't forget your staff. Okay, great. Great. Coming in? Good, good, good. Very good. Vesta, we'll start with "Silent Night." What? We'll start with "Silent Night"! No, Vesta. I want to change the order. You can never change the order... of the pageant music with Vesta. You'll have to wait until she dies. That could be arranged. I'm serious. Whoever is mooing, please stop it. Cut the cow! Sawdust for brains, this one. Okay. If we could just start. Okay. Stand. Evelyn. Oh, my God, Lloyd. What happened? It's an allergy. I think I'm in anaphylactic shock. You're in ana-who? I've read about this. I know all the characteristics. I've got the hives. I've got the swelling of the neck. I've got the cramping little tummy pains. It's the spirit gum. I told you you were using too much. I was the one who said that. Shut up, okay? Wheezing, throat closing down... inability to breathe. Oh, my God, we've gotta get to a hospital. I need a broncho-dilator. Let me just... I can help you with this here. There's your broncho-dilator! That really hurt. You could say thank you. Are you okay, honey? I don't know. It was like... an assault! Oh, you're welcome. What a jerk. I can't work with him. Yeah? That makes two of us! All right, all right, come on. Come on, guys. Let's, uh... Let's try to keep our eyes on the prize, okay? Those TV cameras out there... they're gonna wanna see happy faces. Yeah, well, then why is his ugly mug centerstage? I'll tell ya why. Because his wife is the big kahuna here! You take that back, you big giraffe. Why, you little... You can't do that! Watch me! Stop it! Both of you! In front of the children, no less. Some great Christmas pageant. I can't be a wise man, not with these two fools. I'm turning in my beard. Oh, no. Ow. We need a wise man. Does he have a line? I know the perfect person. I'll be right back. I haven't seen Butch here since... Nine years. The funeral. It can't be. - Ho ho ho! - Pop! - Paddy boy! - How are ya? T-Bone! Oh, my. Man, couple of fine young California redwoods. Yeah! Dang! Hey, boys, I got your Christmas presents right back here. Just what the doctor ordered, yes, sir. There it is, boys. There it is. Christmas classic. Go ahead, Paddy-whacker. Get 'em out here, huh? I been collecting 'em for a long time. Many years now. That's vintage gold. First-class merchandise. Go ahead. Open 'em up. Don't be bashful. Yes, sir. They're worth many, many drachmas. That right there, 100% made in America. That's hot stuff. Turn it. These are great, Dad. Well, boys, I got this puppy all tuned up... for our invasion down Mexico way. Yes, sirree. I've been saving my pennies... and I got myself a pretty little pile... because we are going to Mexico... where the beer is cold and the señoritas hot. Boys, we gotta go soon, huh? Olé! Wait, Dad, don't you want to stay for a little bit? Stick around? You mean like park the carcass... - chew the fat a while? - Yeah. Or no, but... It's actually kinda serious, Dad. Look, why don't you just come inside? See, some stuff happened, and... I'll tell ya, Thomasito, stuff happens. You remember what Confucius say: "Life's a bitch... "and then you die." Right, but, Dad... And you will be dead a long, long time. Dad, don't you wanna come in for just a minute? Well, not at this momento. No, thank you. I got a noose waiting for me... down at the Hangtown Saloon. But you could stick around, right? We really gotta talk, Dad. What's the matter, boy? Ain't you gettin' any? - Incoming! - That's not the problem. I mean, that is... This is about something totally different, Dad. Okay, I'll stick around a little while. Whatever the problem is, all you gotta do... is just grab your ass with both hands... and never let go. Yes, sir. I can hear them señoritas right now. Oh, hey, boys. I got you guys a couple of stocking stuffers... on my last trip to Mexico. Olé! Bitchin', Tom. Hold on, Butch. Stay right like that. Cool. Say, Rembrandt... would you like to take a walk with me? I'm gonna go see my kid. Sure. I can't sleep. They say that time heals, but I... I still can't sleep. And, uh... it hurts the same, year after year. Why doesn't it get easier? I miss you. Son, I miss you very much. Merry Christmas. You gotta be still, okay? It's our final dress rehearsal... and I want it to be perfect. Okay, stand up. And... I told you not to change the order. "We Wish You a Merry Christmas," Vesta. I may not be Miss Placerville... but I can still turn on a tree. You want Placerville to look its very best on TV, don't you? Of course I do. Well, who is the only nationally recognized personality... this town has to offer? Okay. We'll give it a shot, okay? I knew that you'd see it my way. Ooh, make a wish. I just did. Evie, honey, I'm sorry. I can't keep this beard on anymore. This spirit gum, it's killing me. Perfect. That was great. Now Lloyd says he's quitting. He's quitting? Lord, we need another wise man. Oh, he can't quit. Don't worry. I'll be right back. Just keep singing. Them damn Krauts... they circled us here and here. And that's why they called it the Bulge. We were like fish in a barrel. Ol' Bill was a big walleye, believe you me. Hello, Bill. I heard there was a drifter in town. Hi, sweetie. It's been a while. Not long enough. That's not a very kind thing to say. Want a drink? Not really... but I figured you did. So I do. So I do, my dear. I read once that drinking was dangerous... so I gave up reading. Still killing time, huh, Bill? No one ever kills time, honey. But you can hold it captive. You told me that one about a hundred years ago. Feels like a hundred years, that's for damn sure. Lot of water under the bridge. Rivers under the bridge. Oceans. We were young once, sweet Maryanne Couple of crazy kids had a wedding. My mother threw rice. You threw firecrackers. You sure were beautiful. Still are. If I may say so myself... I was quite a handsome young lad once upon a time. You used to call me your knight in shining armor. I see you've gotten some dents over the years. Yeah, well... all that armor... got a little heavy. I just couldn't, uh... Back then, we sure were on the merry-go-round... chasin' that brass ring. I'm still goin' for it. Yeah, while you're grabbing that brass ring... I'm trying to scrape together a living to raise two boys. And they are damn fine young men. Thank you. Bill, I've never asked you for anything. Ever. But the church needs your help. Hold on, darlin'. Usually people put that the other way around. I need you to perform in the pageant. Whoa, Nellie. Bill, after this year's pageant, I'm... Well, things change... and you never know what's gonna happen. The boys may not make it home again for Christmas. I just want this Christmas to be really special. Memorable. Please. Well... things aren't always... as memorable as they used to be, darlin', you know. At least I don't have Alzheimer's. I have some-heimer's. I remember some things. I remember everything. Do it for Pat and Tom. You owe them. Sugar, I don't owe anybody anything. Oh, you do. You owe me. Not this contraption. I want my staff, my rod. I don't use a walker, a walker! It turns you into an old woman. It walks you. But a staff, a rod. Give me something I can assault the enemy with! Hello, Glen. Sid. Sid? In the too, too solid flesh. Hey, boy-o. There was something I was supposed to tell you. Nice to see you, Tom. Thanks for coming, Mr. Marvin. Oh, now I remember, yes. Go to hell. I've already been there. How's my market, Sid? It's been a while since I've had a new Glen Wesman to offer. I need a great painting. He needs a great check. He's in rare form today. What did you put in his coffee? I will not pander. I won't put crap out on the market. No, no, no, no. Glen, Glen... I know you've had some pain. I've known pain all my life. What I'm feeling now is rage. Rage that you'd like to calculate my suffering... and translate it into dollars and cents. I'm through with the whole business. I'm done, I'm finished. I've heard that speech before. You think you're the only one who's ever suffered? Every year, Marc Chagall yelled at me, huh? Said he'd never paint again. But he always came up with a new piece from inside. And you can do the same. I've been trying for months to do it, Sid. To capture Nicole... so the world would never lose her. It's not there. I may not live to see Christmas. Get to work. As you leave... I'm leaving? I just got here. Your inspiration has exhausted me. As you leave... would you please bring me my staff? My rod. I'll do that. Somehow this walker has appeared by my bed... and I don't want the damn thing. Uh, Your Worship. Now you can go to hell. Nicole... Nicole... Those pictures are unsaleable. They're not finished. They are finished. He won't go back and finish them... and he knows it. He's been depressed ever since Nicole died... and it's gotten in the way of his genius. It's worse than that. He's been getting confused lately. He has one more painting in him. I'm sure of it. That would make your bank account very happy, I'm sure. I know you think I'm some kind of mercenary. That's my job. I love Glen. I love his art, too. And I've done right by him for a long time. And he's done a hell of a lot for you. So... how's life treating you? Have you got a minute, Mr. Marvin? My family... we're... We're in a bit of a financial pinch. Do you think maybe... Do you think maybe there'd ever be a buyer... for any of these? I don't think so. Your teachers at Berkeley do this kind of thing better. These are pale imitations. I'm sorry. You might have something inside you. I don't think you've found it yet. But you sure as hell can draw. It's beautiful. It's this little town and... these people I've known all my life. There's so much love here. It's beautiful, Tom. Don't ever doubt that. Nanette was my first love. I hadn't seen her in almost a year. Funny how my heart jumped. Five... four... three, two... one. Oh, that's so tacky. Take that, Gunderson. Keep them lights a-coming, Patrick. You're doing great there, boy. What do you want to do today, Vesta? Look, there we are. Hi, Butch. Mother's milk. Right back at ya. If we could just start. Mr. Chang. Gunderson... the wind is blowing down your elves. What wind? And your flocking stinks. Your flocking is outstanding. You can bring love into our church pageant... but you have to hear it and feel it first. Am I beautiful? I thought so. It's coming along, huh? Gunderson. Yeah. Merry Christmas there, Butch. January 5th. I don't know, Kinkade. I mean, it's, uh... Well, it's interesting. No, it's not. It's not gonna work. Hey. There's my store. Wow. Very beautiful. I like that very much. See? He hates it. Oh, well. That's me... with Jupiter. You see how friendly he is? I told ya, Tom. Look how skinny I am. You know, it was actually my idea... to have him paint the people... that make Placerville so special. I may not know much about artwork... but I do know what the public wants. Very beautiful. You ready to take a break there, Tom, huh? A break? No. Day after tomorrow's Christmas Eve. This has to be ready for the TV cameras. No, you can take a break after Christmas. Yeah? Listen, fifty bucks... if you can find a spot to put me in there, huh? Fifty? Yeah? Forty-five. Just paint me in. Okay, great. Wonderful. Big Jim gave me some overtime. And I'll have 500, assuming I can finish the mural. Then there's about 200 in my savings account. I must have a hundred or so. That leaves us short. Hello. I'm looking at you right now. Hi. At one of your paintings. Hope. I miss you so much, Thomas. Yeah, me, too. And I decided, if you can't come to me... I'll come to you. Dad. Number one son! Park yourself right there. Join me at the altar, Tommy. What I'm most proud about you, T-Bone... T-Boneus Rex... is that you never took up smoking. I'm really proud about that. Look, Dad, I have to talk to you about Mom. Right, yeah. I remember. You mentioned the, uh... The money. See, Mom got behind. Oh, she got behind, did she? Well, there's the switch. She was always and forever grinding my gears... about getting behind. Now she's behind. That, number one son, I find a regular laugh riot. Well, it's not funny. We're gonna lose the cottage, Dad. We gotta come up with $3,000. Three grand. Big spender, your mother. Look, Dad, she... She loaned people money, okay? She gave people things. She never gave me a dime. Well, couldn't... Couldn't you for me? For Pat? Well, you see, kiddo... number one son... I ain't got it. I'm livin' paycheck to damn paycheck. What about the Mexico money? Poof. I'm livin' week to week... hand to damn mouth. Let me tell you something. That's the only way to live. Week to week, day to day... hour to hour, minute to minute. Each day in the moment, son. Enjoy the hell out of life. One day, you wake up... and it's gone. What happens if you're about to lose everything... that's made you who you are? Your home, your teacher... your hopes and dreams? When that all goes, what's left? I'm not sure about the speaker system, Tom. I don't think they have it anymore. Well, just ask him, Mom. Look, Ernie swears it's in there... and he says he needs it for the pageant. And you know how Ernie is. He's not gonna let me alone until he gets an answer. Okay. Mom, what about the speaker? I couldn't ask him, Tom. Why not? Because I don't work there anymore. What? I got laid off in September. Business was slow. Oh, my God. You should've told us. No, I didn't wanna worry you kids... interfere with your school. Mom, you come down here every day, all day long. No, I sit on the bench, or I go over... and I visit at the hospital, or I, um... I help out at the church. And I look for work every day, but there's nothing out there. We're going to lose the house, Tom. We're gonna lose everything. No. No, Mom, hey, it'll be okay. I'm not so sure anymore. How will we live? Oh, God. I'll move. I'll leave Placerville, and I'll get a job in... No. We'll figure it out, okay? You have so many friends here in town. They'll help. - I'll go talk to everybody in town. - No! No, you won't. Maryanne Kinkade does not ask for charity. I couldn't endure the shame, humiliation. I will suffer this alone. The last thing that I still have that is mine is my pride. You understand. Shouldn't I be in the center, and shouldn't I be bigger? You're plenty big, Tanya. Can you fix it? I'll see what I can do. And you messed up my nose. I know, I hate that. I love your nose. Guess who. Hey, you made it. Well? Well, it pays the rent, right? All of a sudden, Hope was there... with all her big city dreams for me... and my two worlds collided. Hey. Get ready to go. That's it, that's it. Smile. Smile. Oh, that's it. Oh, good. Okay. This is so great. Ernie, look this way. Come on. That's it, That's it. Oh, good, Cheryl. Stand back there. How'd the skank weasel her way back in, Ernie? What's she got on ya? Nothing. Nothing! Yeah, and if birds could fly. Yes, birds can fly. Suck an egg, '77. Hey, come on, ladies. Please, zip, zip. All right. And now from Placerville... the official Christmas tree capital of the world... here to light our town twee... our town tree is a veteran Miss Placerville. So here she is now to turn it on. Hello, Sacramento. I'm Tanya Kapinski, Miss Placerville, 1974. You know, I've worked as a professional model... for many years. And in fact, if you happen to have... the April 1974 issue of "Easy Rider"... I'd be more than happy to sign that for you... - right after the ceremony. - That's good, huh? But there's no place like home. I mean, really, home is just the best place... that a person could be from. And so it is with my great honor... that I'm here to light up Placerville... the Christmas tree capital of the world. Okay, in five, four, three, two, one. What? Just 'cause I wired it? It wasn't my fault, okay?! Nicole. Give me your hand. Hi, Glen. It's me. Sorry, I'm a little behind. I... What a day. There's a beautiful moon coming up. A crescent moon for Christmas. I brought you something. It's icy on the bridge. Don't fall. Your fingers in mine, Nicole. It's Maryanne. I brought you some hot chocolate, Glen. I don't want to lose you. Give me your hand. Here, let me help you up. Stubborn woman. Lean on me. We'll cross the Pont Neuf. Glen, we're not in Paris. We're in your studio. My studio? My easel, my paints? They're all here. Nicole? It's 1977, Glen. You've made me an old man. I was young a moment ago. Here, look at this. Smell this. Isn't it beautiful? Let me take you on a walk. You haven't been outside in... in weeks. Let me take you on a walk. Let me take you to the Christmas pageant. I respectfully decline your invitation. My next visit to the church will be for my funeral. There's still life out there for you, Glen. You need to touch it and taste it and see it. I see more than you think. Maryanne, you're killing yourself with pride. That night, Placerville had its chance to redeem itself. The Christmas pageant seemed like a sure thing. I mean, how can you go wrong... with little kids and some wise men? I figured wax-based paint would really make the scenery shine... under the TV lights. Showtime. "And it came to pass in those days... "that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus... "that all the world should be taxed. "And Joseph went up from Galilee into Bethlehem with Mary... "his espoused wife. "And she brought forth their firstborn son... "and she wrapped him in swaddling clothes... "and laid him in a manger... "for there was no room for them at the inn." What's wrong? What's happening to the scenery? Oh, my God. We must've used too much wax. Under these lights... It's melting. Oh, look, the donkey's peeing. "And, um, there were in that same country shepherds"... That's not good. That's not... "watching over their flock." Stop laughing. Oh, well, looks I'm gonna be on riot control any minute. Let's walk off. Come on, Sweetie. Let's walk. No, no, no. What are you doing? No, no, no. Mary, sit down. What's going on? No, no, no, no, no, don't stop the show. It is not the end of the world. Yes, it is the end of the world. You don't understand. This was supposed to be a beautiful Christmas pageant. It was supposed to be a light, airy... Get back there. There was supposed to be a lighted Christmas tree... in the town square. No. Huh, great. And now the final humiliation. Thank you, Tommy. Thank you. This is all your fault. For goodness sake. You don't have to listen to this, Thomas. Let's get out of here... back to where they appreciate you. Oh! Oh, wonderful. Okay. Well, the TV people are packing it in... and, great, the audience is leaving, too. Well, Tommy, you painted the scenery. You're the one that screwed up! Now, now. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Just cool your jets there, Captain Kangaroo... and back off. Tommy Boy didn't screw this up. He gave this town a great Christmas gift. Look at that mural. He gave you the heart and soul of this place. Yeah, it looks pretty good to me. This old town... you don't need to impress anyone. You're A-okay just the way you are. Aren't we all here celebrating... someone who was born in a garage? Stable. Or a... - Stable. - Stable. Stable? He never had much money, either. Thank you. Thank you for your time. Thanks, Dad. We'd love to share... our Christmas candle lighting ceremony with you. The children are ready. Come on, children. Let me help with you that, darlin'. Hope. You don't belong here. I don't know where I belong. Don't give up on yourself. I'm not giving up. Will you read, Maryanne? "For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given. "And the government shall be upon his shoulder... "and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor... "the Mighty God, the Everlasting Father... "the Prince of Peace." You know, I don't know a lot about scripture. I'm not a scholar, and I'm not a preacher... but when I look out and I see the faces... of these young children in the candlelight... so full of hope... I feel the presence of God right here... like little angels telling us all... to, "Fear not, I bring you tidings of great joy." You are the light of the world in a... a very dark winter. And we could all use a little bit of extra light right now. Excuse me, angel. I light this candle as a symbol of sharing God's love... with all of his children. That Christmas Eve, I realized that in a vast, black night... even a little light shines brightly... and all we can do is our best to find that light... and share it with others. Ernie. Okay. And... Merry Christmas. Happy holidays. Bless you. It's Christmas Eve, Glen. How are you? Remember when you told me... this was the one night of the year when animals could talk? You said when the animals talk, it wasn't magic. It was holy... a glimpse of the sacred. You said it was a moment where we could understand... the heart of every living thing. I always thought it was a miracle... when you built your studio in the field by my house. It was like God's gift to me, bringing you here. You always told me you weren't gonna teach me how to paint... but why to paint. And I'll be forever grateful to you for that. I wish I could give you back something... but I have nothing. We're losing the cottage, Glen. A year from now, I have no idea where we'll be. This may be our last Christmas together... and I have no gift for you, Glen. I have no way to thank you for everything. No money, nothing. Just love. I love you, Glen. Don't give up, please. That's the first thing you taught me... about being an artist: you never give up. Don't give up, Glen. There's a light in you still. The snow stopped falling by Christmas morning. It had blanketed Placerville... Thank you. deep and crisp and even. Now it's your turn. There you go. Open it up. Thank you, Tom. Now I have the cottage forever. No, no, no, no, no. Don't say no, Mom. It's not much, but it's a start of a new life for us. We gotta stick together. We're all we've got. Thank you, Pat. Thank you. It looks like a million dollars to me. Good morning. We've come to help you fix this place up. Then maybe you could sell it. It's about time somebody gave you a gift for Christmas. But how did everybody know? I spilled the beans. We know this probably won't solve all your problems... but we had to do something. It was kind of my idea. I mean, after all you've done for us. Maryanne, for you. For good fortune and happiness. I don't know what to say. Say merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Okay, son, that ought to do it. Let's give her a shot. All right, come on, baby. Come on now! Come to Big Bill. Start that truck! Attaboy. Please sweep the dust back in. What? You are sweeping the good luck out of the house. Let go of broom. Go, go. Yes. Do it. Do it. Very good. Yeah. I never knew. Knew what? That you matter to everyone? Well, you do. Tom, can you get that, please? Glen, what are you... Come here. Come in. Oh, my God. What are you doing here? How'd you get over here? My staff. My rod. Are you okay? It's the light, Tom, that's what lasts. The leaves are transient. They grow, turn green, turn red, and die... but behind them, the light lasts forever. Glen, please, come sit down. Paint the light. Christmas gift. Remember how Sidney hoped I had one more painting in me? I did. Just one. Latin. Good old Latin. "The Last Leaf"... is my last painting, Tom. No, Glen, no. I had been trying to paint my sorrow... to show the bleakness of a world without Nicole. But then you came with a candle last night... and I knew what Nicole's memorial should be. Not darkness, no, but light. Sometimes we can barely see beyond the forest to the sky. I was painting the leaves of the forest... and never saw the light of the sky behind it. Now I see it. That's all I need to see now. I'll treasure this forever, Glen. No, you will not. You will take it to Sidney Marvin... and you will sell it. The last Glen Wesman should bring you enough... to keep this cottage forever. Oh, Glen. Thank you. No, thank you. Thank you. What for? You managed to put Humpty-Dumpty back together again. Those were the last brushstrokes Glen ever painted. He sat at our table for Christmas dinner. - There, Tom. You'll carve it. - Of course. All right. Holy Father, bless this meal... and all who are gathered here. Amen. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, Glen. My mother made sure Glen was well-fed. After dinner, we sang carols. The old favorites, with words like... "the hopes and fears of all the years"... and "God rest ye merry, gentlemen." Then I helped Glen walk home. Big Jim stayed up all night... fixing the wiring on that tree... and Placerville turned on its real lights that year. I always thought it was the year we found Christmas... all over again. Wow. When I went to see Glen the next evening... he had gone home for good. He was back where the light burns brighter... than we could ever imagine. Pacem, Glen. Peace. You showed me the light... a light that has filled my life ever since. You have that power holding the whole world together. Now I see it. That was thirty years ago. Today, Big Jim still puts up just one star, nothing else. And he and the Gundersons finally became friends. Vesta's buried in that little cemetery near our house. Butch is there, too... finally resting peacefully next to his son. Glen's painting took a journey, too... and is now owned by a museum in New York. Mr. Rosa retired, but he still keeps track of all of our lives. Tanya kept entering the Miss Placerville contest... until she was well into her 50s. And to this day, Ernie still promotes Placerville... quietly. Pat stuck with his schooling... and became a well-known writer and professor. Nanette? Well, that's a story for another day. And Mom, thanks to Glen's gift of love... well, she never had to worry about a mortgage payment again. She got a job she loved with the county... and retired several years later. And Bill? Well, my dad kept leading his crazy life... driving his old heap in search of new adventures. As for me, I'm still trying my best... to use the lessons Glen taught me. Lessons about art, about life, and about light. In the end, love is the brightest light of all. FOR GLEN
