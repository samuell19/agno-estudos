- How did you get here? Pour me a drink. So we go into the café. He buys me one, then another— He left. I was furious. Especially since he wasn't bad looking. I'm a bit shy, but I'll recite a little poem. "Dying in his sleep He lived in his dreams His dream was the tide Flowing up the side The tide flowing down Your eyes in those eyes Your lips on that lip It is to you That I bade farewell to life You who mourned me to the point I wanted to mourn myself" That's it. Do you still live with your parents? Why were you looking at me when you were reciting your poem? It was the only way I had to talk to you. - What do you do for a living? - For a living? What about you? - I'm a dancer. - Modern dance? Ballet. And what do you do on Sundays? - It depends. - I go on bike rides. I love it. Would you like to come with me tomorrow? - Yes. - The old station at 11am, alright? I'll be there. - Tired? - A little. - Do you want to stop? I'm sick of this town. - Let's go in. - Here? But it's a cemetery. We won't find a quieter place. - Have you never been here? - No, I've only been past it. It's a big place. I wouldn't like to be here on my own. Is it the sadness that alarms you? I'm not really afraid. In a normal cemetery you can see the roads and the houses together. Here all you can see is graves. Nothing else. I've never been in here either. A cemetery like this is quite reassuring. Reassuring? Yes, because it's a bit like being in the countryside. There are trees, big empty spaces. There is still some room. - Shall we go now? - Why? Don't you like it here? No cars, no litter, nobody to disturb us. - Do you really want to stay here? - Why not? Have a rest. I'll go and get the basket. Wait. I'm coming with you. Catch me if you can! Do you really want to go back in? "Abandon all hope ye who enter here. " - Don't joke with these things. - Why? Are you scared? It's just — It's deserted. No, look. - It's not very solid. - Put it back. I'll stick it back in. Don't worry. They're buried a lot further down. The crucifixes are put up in memory of Jesus. Yes, of course. I'm going give you a bit of chocolate. Are you mad? Not here. Spending money on that — That was all right for Pharaohs. Yes, but Pharaohs knew how to embalm bodies. It didn't bring them back to life. Why would that be harder than being born? I don't care where they put me when I'm dead. Do you think the soul escapes from the body after death? Is there such a thing as the soul? I don't think there's anything left after physical death. And it's stupid to spend all that money on dead bodies. Some do that out of love. Well, I prefer the love of life than the love of death. Look, this one's open. Let's go in and see what it's like. No, you can't do that. Are you afraid? It's daylight. There's nothing to be fightened of. Are you coming? No, you mustn't. I told you, there are a lot of people about. Were you frightened? If we go down there, we won't be disturbed. - You don't want to? Too bad. I'll leave you here then. I'll go on my own. No, wait for me. It's damp. The bodies stop decomposing if it's not damp. Like in the desert. See, it's not bad here. And we're sheltered from the noise. It's like a Roman tomb. Come here. Come close to me. - Did the tomb shut on its own? -the sun has set, that's all. They say that the stars are gods sending us signals. Come on, let's go. The light on my bike doesn't work. That's strange. I can't see the path anymore. I'll climb up and have a look. I don't recognise it anymore. Let's go. We'll find a path. You see, I was right. This path should take us back to the main one. Do you think they've shut the gates? What time is it? My watch. I must have left it in the crypt. I'll get it. No, don't go. Don't leave me. I don't want to go back in there. All right. We must have gone the wrong way. The main path must be the other way. Right. There's no point carrying on. It could go on for ages. We'll just cut through the graves. It's the same place as before. I'm going get my watch back. Stop it. I want to go. Don't panic. We'll get out of here. Let's shout together. Someone will come. Who? - Hurry up. - Wait for me. - I'm exhausted. Wait. Come on. Over here. Look. Over there. What is it? It looks like an administrative building. There must be somebody in here. - Please, get me out of here. - Don't worry. Do you think it's much further? I think it's this way. Yes, I know roughly where we are. Close your eyes, I'll let you know. Is it all right now? Can I open my eyes yet? Wait a bit more. We're walking along the railings. Don't open your eyes. Please let me feel the railings. You lied to me. That's enough. I've had enough. Shut up. I'm going leave you here, do you hear me? Stop it. Listen. Let's walk. At least that'll warm us up. We're in a provincial cemetery, not in the jungle. Are you cold? Cold? Listen. I don't know. I don't know anymore. Damn cemetery. Please don't be angry. Do you think the dead — Do those old things frighten you? Watch this. Stop it. It's not moving. The bloke underneath must be holding onto it. Let's wander around. We'll find the exit eventually. Aloes live for 50 years. They die after blossoming just once. - What are you talking about? - Just once. - Are you alright? Do you want to stop? Come on then. The first of November. The world of the dead meets the world of the living. What are you doing? Get up, for God's sake. I'm fine here. Leave me alone. You're mad. Now is not the time to stop. Otherwise we'll be here all night. No. I'm begging you. Not now. Control yourself. You who know the land underground... can you hear me? You, my friends, answer me. They've locked you in with their railings and their crucifixes. You're not dead. They are. They've shut the door of the castle — of crystal. What are you hiding? - It's fine. - Shut up. Don't worry. The dead are our friends. We'll find the way here. And only here. We're going walk to the outer wall. Then we'll find the gate. Can you hear? The road. The wall. Come on. We'll climb up over there. Forget about the railings. We'll be out in two minutes. Aren't you happy? Why do you want to go back to them? They don't know the real way. All they think about is destroying. Hurting. Making dirty. They don't love each other like we do. If our love for each other is strong enough, they'll be powerless against us. They'll all die. That's enough! Are you coming or what? Don't go. It's only midnight. The crystal rose. It'll guide us. What do you want me to do with it? You should calm down. Why are you thinking about death when we're in this wonderful garden? Trees, sand, shelters, houses. Those stone sculptures in our garden. Catch me if you can. Wait. Stop. Well done. You're right. Someone will see the flames. A fire in the cemetery will attract the caretakers. The way. Take care of the fire. I'm going get my watch back. We're safe now. Open up. What are you doing? Open up. Go, my love. There's the way. That's the way that we'll leave real life. All the happiness in the world... Death. Where are you? Come here. Search, my love. Search further. The land underground. Together forever. No more fear. No more pain. They won't touch us anymore. The wicked are leaving us. Go, carry your birds of gold. Come in. Walk. No, no violence. Be strong, my love. For both of us. From the wind gardens all the perfumes open their arms to us. Generous friends. Swirls of swallows towards the light. Warm arms around me. Now the crystal castle, day and night, in the light of dawn, as big as the sky and the Earth. They're waiting for us, my love. Walk. The birds are still laughing. On my mouth all your kisses. Oh, yes, I love you. The fields covered with summer, far under the wind, beyond death, quickly, as far as the blue. Careful. On us the sparks of the sun. You're coming. Give me your hand. Go down. There are flowers dancing. Your fingers are burning, my love. Your breath on my body. Wait for me. Together forever. Open up! Open up, I said. I can't breathe anymore. I'm suffocating. Quick. Come back. Where are you, my love? Wait for me. Together forever. Wait for me. I'm coming down to you. Give me your hand. Your hand. You... all dead. We... alive.
