every time there's a new guest grandfather tells the same old chestnut it is a fruit that is picked from a vine look at it it's a simple thing but look at it closely the grape is the living proof of the existence of God because it is a fruit which God created complete and which knows what it was created for and knows what to do it will turn itself into wine it will not necessarily turn itself into a good wine it will not turn itself into a Rambo wine but it will turn itself into wine from the infancy of the world wine has been the symbol of man's communion with God a wine is used in church when we Kris not sure it is you is it mass when we make our vows of marriage the first miracle of our blessed Savior was performed at a wedding when he turned the water into wine to bless the union of a happy couple and with this wine in this glass sent to me by my son lon I am most happy tonight to welcome a new member into our family my dear granddaughter Elizabeth speech spray speech it's very nice of you of all of you to try to make me feel that I belong and to give me this welcoming let me know that there's some place that I am that I am a member of the family I know that the grandfather and admire have written several times to my father asking me to visit the first time was when my mother died but he wanted me with him we liked being together and doing things together and - that is it seems that this time was the time that he should send that I should come here I I don't know all of you yet I hardly know your names yet but I'll promise to correct that oh yeah there's a newcomers riffraff come on that's what that's a good idea natio Martin why not oh I'm ready I can dress the fences room let's go up I'll meet you back here I don't have a swimming costume I put one in your room thank you have a good swim idea which one are you another Rambo John a cousin well almost a cousin pretty confused aren't you yes I am who is that one that the woman talking without Nasser why that's the mother of Andre your intended your aunt twice removed your that scrambled you don't know which end is up where's Andre I think you still in the house changed yes it's nice out here quite a sight listen listen to the vines you can almost hear them grow what oh you're being funny look at that mineralized earth the best grapes oil in the world and so what I don't understand got a thing called prohibition here haven't you heard something about it an amendment to the Constitution of the United States if you can imagine an eighteenth Amendment to legislate what a free people shall put in their stomach to us it means we can't sell wine seems silly this silly we've had it for 12 long years how do you like the Klan how can I know yet your precious mineralized earth getting in my shoes taking off why don't you when one my hoes take them off too I'll bet you've never had your naked feet in the ground before your life feels very peculiar but it feels good didn't you know you were being brought over for a wedding no I did not that's the way it's done in our clan you see old Phillipe Rambo had a lot of this earth but not enough and he had two daughters there were two men named Ferrand with a lot of his earth and so he married Isabel off to Ronald and that was absorbed and he married Martha off to Francis and that was absorbed another Stag's Leap and if Andre marries out of the family it goes out of the family and here we go again look good Andres okay doesn't give a hoot about grapes he wanted to become a priest they soon knock that out of him that's where I live up there that light is in my mother's room she's an invalid oh now I place you I'm I'm sorry about your mother and about your father - why my father well unless I'm confused Aunt Martha said that your father died so the storybook has it my father is no more dead than we are you're talking about the husband and my mother he's dead well now I am confused well Phillipe also had two sons one son name was LOD flew the coop and there a young lady from France and you're the result of that the other son's name was Victor and he married Charlotte Marty my sister Monica as a result of that my father met you at the train oh sweet uncle Francis before he married Aunt Martha so what does that make me family doesn't know I know but I've known about it ever since I was a little kid that's what you meant when you said you were almost a cousin now how do you like the clan so you're not in love with Andre I'm not in love with anyone that's a good and kissed been very well kissed liked it too [Music] hi you forgot your shoes [Music] [Music] well what is the judgment on this young one Francis it has a nose father but it seems to me to be a little flat on the palate mother it lacks the characteristics of the original variety and shows a premature growth on the country my idea Ronald I'll leave it to the experts you good morning father oh sorry I'm late you almost missed the tasting of the Chevrolet he lost tasted it twice before this animal is John I want your opinion very well grandfather 1930 made from the Chardonnay vineyard number three a rich soil needs to be balanced for the blending of Pinot Blanc in what proportion 20% Russian to a change like that boneheaded and as usual John you'll go to extremes but I'll consider your suggestion grandfather four times a year we go through this same stupidity tasting samples of the wines were not allowed to make four times a year for 12 long years I'm show a little respect for you for what prohibition you know how that word upset your grandfather it is a la John and as long as it's law it will be obeyed by me and by mine John when I started in the mountain vineyard where I make the wines for the old town I and father please don't put us through this grape is a holy fruit thing again I started in the mountain vineyard and I have been an empire a dynasty I am proud of what I have been a wine dynasty that can't operate which can't do anything pretty is present the next wine you yes sir you aren't you sure Anthony I'm looking at the grandfather to said the winery is this the one certainly is if you'll go out through that door they'll find him for you John what's your opinion of this Cabernet my opinion is at this rate we'll go broke I don't mean any disrespect I don't but you make us live in a dream world we we grow grapes let's sell grapes organize the growers to control the shipping and the price there's a fortune Martha would like to say she agrees but she doesn't dare ours is a business for gentlemen yes John there is a fortune to be made in selling grapes to bootleggers and gangsters makes our belly why we didn't make the law and the whole nation breaks it it's a law itself that's responsible for the gangsters other growers sell grapes not my people in this valley not Mamoulian ap'to chi and yucca wits and all the other small growers you've been supporting for years who've been feeding off the grand old man of wine why John the grand oh I would rate myself not so high but I am a winemaker that's who I have been and will be again and so each year I shall tend my vines and cultivate and graft and replant I foretaste my wines to study how to make them better I shall sell only the grapes that are suitable for use on the table or for raisins the wine grapes these I shall plow under to nourish and replenish the soil I shall do this until these dark days are passed and I am permitted to resume in a way that is legal in the nicest possible way did you have a good ride thank you have a glass of wine No thank you I'm I'm sure I'm in the way John show my granddaughter through the winery if you please she has come to join a family of winemakers you want to begin to learn something about it anything you say sir Elizabeth dear don't forget our luncheon today I want that rifle John hmm I think you were right about the Shapley and vineyard number three thank you sir red would bet I am in wonderland well listen atlas what did you mean last night at the table when you said when you almost said that it was the right time for your father to send you here it was a slip of the tongue Oh slip of the tongue gallons of good wine spoiling because I've been kept in grammar school too long you see wine is a living thing that's the first thing you have to understand and his grandfather says grapes are complete with everything to make wine that must be tutored to become good wines and to know how to educate them is the art of a good winemaker now first we squeeze the juice of the grapes into tanks over there fermentation starts that's kindergarten then at just the right time the master takes the juice out of the tanks and puts the young wines in to these facts and that's grammar school I see that slip yours you're sure it was just a slip of the tongue yes I'm very sure are you taking a bunch of children starting out in the first grade together some of them are slow to learn to be kept in grammar school a long time take those wines are the redwood bets too soon it's not good some of the children are bright quick to learn leave those wines we're a school too long they stop learning I'm support that's what's happening here I can get my hands on all of this you've make it into Bradley before it's too late boy what a hangover now this will call high school these are casks they're made of Oakland you see Redwood is all right up to a point but when it comes time for aging and mellowing don't really learn ok the thing get it cousin oh by the way I don't tell that to everybody I just soon you didn't either you know let's not have another slip of the tongue now some of these casks come from Spain some have come from France look at this one it's almost a hundred years old are you gonna marry Andre doesn't that classifier is not your business Andres a friend of mine I wouldn't like to see him get hurt what's in you Elizabeth secret I wish I knew grandfather told you only to show me the winner in so he did you and I have a long way to go well limestone cave nature's refrigerator temperature doesn't vary in here one degree winter or summer now this call it

John who is this F will be explained in River yes the freight or the hauling course from shipping point to destination thank you any other questions mr. Youkilis we small growers have always sold our grapes to mr. Phillip Rambo does he join this association I think he will later when he sees the price we get for the grapes and the money it brings into the valley mr. John please who will buy these grapes at $50 a ton mr. patootie I have contact with a syndicate in Chicago who you this syndicate bootleggers fellows after a dealer sells you a truck mr. patootie it's not his business what you do with it or what you haul in it or how you treat it after you sell your grapes it is not your business what the buyer does with him let's think of it that way I think about it now gentlemen as I've explained before it's important that every grower in the valley signs this association contract otherwise we will not be able to control the market and get the big price mr. John now I will go and ask mr. Philip Rambo if he says for me to sign an association contract I side me too I will also the way to graffiti yes sir my grandfather's been buying your grapes each year ever since prohibition closed the winery and plowing them into the ground for fertilizer it's only reasonable that he cannot keep this up forever even at $5 a ton we will ask him anyway what do you know about them furnace especially them Italians my grandfather is getting old he's set in his ways we cannot expect him to see things in the modern way that we do while I'm in Chicago some gentlemen from the syndicate may visit you and explain to you how important it is that everyone signed the contract are we in agreement yeah [Music] [Music] who i yeah we came to your party with the contract I won't sign contract folding monopoly I said enemy he wings I sign I win I once sign I won't find [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] look it's John this prodigal son I'm Sammy brings along is it fatted calf what should I say the bacon what I'm killing you made in Chicago [Music] you say we get $50 a ton for grapes and we can mr.

Leap cutting it up into little parcels and selling it all riffraff that come flooding in here because the price of grapes is high well let's not go to pieces about it and how I shot it a little better

vineyard without you he took a visitor isn't she here how is Elizabeth I haven't heard from her from once is she all right yeah she's all right John since you are prospering there is something you might do for us by Stag's Leap huh yes as a matter of fact and make a down payment on our forgiveness your grandfather's and mine and the whole family's no thank you Aunt Martha dear I'm not in the market for just Stag's Leap because a grandfather and I will be able to buy out the whole Valley sit down John father isn't well he's been failing and I think if you have anything to say to him it

interested to hear if I decide to tell you I'll do so I'm sure you'll pick just the right moment John I wish you wouldn't take that tone you're at mom well then let's you and I talk uncle Francis shall we tell us both the demand for grapes is high the price is going up up up more every day I said I had money well I haven't because it's committed for freight cars to deliver grapes I'll buy a big grape in this valley and not our grape can move without me but I have to have the Rambo fair on grapes Bronco broke do you think father would let you have his grapes to make bootleg wine in that

above me in station but as poor as I she was helping with the harvest she believed in what I believed and consented to become my wife we had an idea that noble wines could be blended by the wedding of the right vines just as good Bloods are blended to make a good family it was her idea to bring the cuttings from the valley to add the softness of the valley to the strong mountain universe you know the grafting of ions is like a marriage to us a holy marriage for we decided that the wines for the church would be made here we worked here side by side day after day as many hives as there was light on our knees our hands in the air there never was another woman like your grandmother god rest her soul she waits for me yeah [Music] you can understand now why to me this is sacred ground it's John
