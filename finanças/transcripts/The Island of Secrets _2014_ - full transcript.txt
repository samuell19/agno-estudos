These waters are some of the richest in antiquities in the world. That's why they're so popular among historians and scientists. Also treasure hunters. - Let me ask you a question. Let's say you find a beautiful antique necklace. What do you do with it? - I don't know. Give it to my morn? Thank you, sweetie. No, stupid! You take it to museum. Bravo! -Why did you say that? Because it's for everybody. -And every piece has its own unique story. I mean it's our responsibility, a privilege, to study them - to learn from them and above all, to take good care of them. What do you want to do when you grow up? -I want to be archaeol... Archaeo... How do you say it in English? He wants to be a Indiana Jones. - Oh, I see. Well, you are in luck. Come with me. This is the island of Kastri. Pieces of a very old pot were found there a while ago. Probably from the Byzantine? Do you see the man with the hat? He is a real-life Indiana Jones. Ruben, some archaeologists here would like to see how you work. Can we bring them ashore? Yes, but I can't show them anything yet. Government secrets. -Buu! There are still secrets. - Secrets! Toni! Did you hear what he said? Hold on, I'll turn down my music. I'm going to find gold and I'm going to be rich when I grow up. Aren't you coming? -I'm not that into diving. I'll stay here with Toni. Okay. Those boys would probably swim all day if it was up to them. I've never liked water that much. - You don't have to. Have to what? - Play the mom game. Guys, we are ready to start. Come on, guys. I would like to introduce to you someone very special. This young lady here is our daughter Adriana. She is going to dive with us today. I'll go to get equipment. Are you all here? Okay, let's go. Now we are diving underwater. When you get back up empty your snorkels. Okay? Let's go. Very good. Looks like you're not diving for the first time. Yeah. I've been in a diving school. -Really? I have a second regulator. Do you want to try? -Okay. It's too deep. Hi. Hi. Are you sure you don't want to join us? I think it's better if I stay here. Have you done this before? - Many times. But not here. You have to try it here. The water is so clear you can see everything. Toni. You don't have to if you don't want to. Great! Let's go. Good, Toni! - Come on, I know how to swim. Dad! Of course you can. Toni! Are you okay? Sit down. Are you okay? Are you sure? -Yes. I'm so sorry. I didn't see what happened. -It's not your fault. Toni, are you okay? - Dad, I'm fine. Hey, it's okay. I know how it feels to have salt water in your lungs. It's awful, right? -Yes. So let's just be a bit more careful in the future, okay? Thank you so much. - It's okay. It's my job. Are you a lifeguard? -No. I am the head of the security company here on the island. So, if you see anything suspicious you call me, okay? This is my business card. Hey. Have a nice day. Where are you going? - To the hotel. We'll all come. -No, you stay here. You stay here. Are you okay? Go ahead. I'll come later. - I feel terrible. I should have kept an eye on him. I didn't know that... Toni hasn't swam since Heli... My wife, Toni's mother... Four years ago there was an accident. They were walking on a frozen lake and they fell through the ice. Only Toni was rescued. He hasn't been in the water after that. Howdy! -What? How are we feeling over here? We thought we would eat and then do whatever you want. I want to go home. The local Art Crime Squad - is worried about tourist treasure hunters who sell their findings - instead of donating them to the National Bureau of Antiquities. One businessman suspected of such crimes is Stefanos Karras. He has been accused of selling local treasures to foreign collectors. We asked Ruben Fokas, a local archaeologist, for his opinion. This is what he had to say. People like him are destroying the birthright of every Greek. He is the kind of people who I cannot accept'... Morn! Aleksi! Look! There's that Ruben who we saw today. And some art detective, Art Crime Squad. How cool is that? ACS! Those two snobby douche bags are not my brothers. And that busybody isn't my mother! Toni... -And you're such a loser! Why don't you ever take my side? And I'm definitely not moving in with them to the suburbs of Espoo! What's a douche bag? Hi. -Hi. How are you? - I don't know what happened. Your dad told me about your mother. I'm so sorry. Let's go have some ice cream. - What? Come on. Come on! Look! Toni and the girl. Hey, let's not bother them. Okay? - Okay. Look, Aleksi. At the stall. - What? Look at the man. - Stop staring. He looks shady. He has a moustache and he's glancing around. The Detective's Handbook says a big moustache is a sign of shadiness. Are you sure? Look. There you go. -Okay. Veeti, look what I bought you. Isn't it nice? -Wow. Aleksi! That's the art thief! - Veeti! We promised morn. Damn it! Your brothers are very nice. - They are not my brothers. The little one is very smart. -No. Yes. He knows more about the history of this island than I do. He's like a small grown-up. - Who sleeps next to his mother. Really? -Maybe I should not have told you that. Too late. Come on, Aleksi. Look, that's Ruben, the archaeologist. What in the world are those two doing together? -Weird. What happened? Have you retrieved the treasure? The truth is we've had some setbacks. We were supposed to pull them out using a robot, but not yet... Not yet? Is it possible? We have two more days. The inspector is coming tomorrow to check the works. He might realize the excavations are just a front for our operation. You were supposed to have finished everything. Hey! I know, but a diver can't fit in there. We have to fix the robot. We'll take them out the same way we've put them there. We put them there? -And we'll take them out the same way. I don't understand. - Forget it. Do you know the legend of Athanasios? Of course. But I would never hurt a child. You listen to me. Tomorrow the deal needs to be over. Otherwise we're done. I wonder what that was about? - We need a translator! You won a competition? - Yes, last year. A national diving competition. We had to dive without equipment. How long can you hold your breath? - Over five minutes. My parents always say that I spend more time underwater than on land. What? - I was just thinking. You love to be underwater and I can't. Perfect match. I found her. Toni! Call the police! Adriana! - Toni, help me! Adriana! Adriana! Toni! Alexandra Costas. Yes, Theo? Take her to the island and tell her we'll let her go when we're done. No, of course not. She knows too much. Tomorrow we will drown her and make it look like an accident. Hi. I'm with Veeti. Isn't he answering? Okay, we're on our way. Toni isn't answering the phone. They're really worried. Ruben Fokas. Look. They're a couple. Knock knock. What are you watching? Football. -Yes, football. I thought you watched only ice hockey in Finland. -No. And Toni, he hasn't contacted you? You know... It is really important that you tell us if you know something. Toni! Where have you been? - Shut up, guys. Adriana has been kidnapped. They tried to kill me. - Huh? Who? One of them was Alexandra. - Guess what we saw. Remember Ruben from the island? - He doesn't, cause he never listens. Ruben and this millionaire art thief met secretly. -So what? They're supposed to be enemies. The millionaire steals treasures. Someone just tried to kill me. - And Ruben is Alexandra's boyfriend. Where did we see this Ruben? -At the desolate island where the digs were. I'm sure Adriana's been taken there. I have to save her. We're coming with you. - You're not going anywhere. Do you know where the island is? - Yes, as soon as you tell me. If someone's going, we're all going. Veeti! Aleksi! Their backpacks and coats are gone. Veeti! -Veeti! Aleksi! So the kids left? - Veeti! Aleksi! Mom's calling. - Don't answer. Don't answer, Aleksi. I have to call. mom. Iâ€™ll just tell her we're looking for you, Toni. What are you... Toni, what are you... - A telephone can be tracked. You've seen too many movies. - You've seen too few. Veeti, give me the map. What's this? - Isn't it cool? No. We are about there. The island is over here. Why would they kidnap Adriana? - Maybe to blackmail her parents. Or Adriana has seen something she shouldn't have. Are you sure Alexandra is involved? - I heard her talking on the phone. She said they'll drown Adriana tomorrow. Why don't we just go to the police? - I think the policeman is involved. It doesn't mean that they all are. - How do you know who is or isn't? Aleksi, we're Adriana's only hope. Show me the map. We can rent jet-skis here. It's about 25 kilometres from here. - Let's go. Before we go can we make up hand gestures and warning signals. If we see something dangerous we can shout "wohoo". Yeah right. Toni, tell us where we're going. Who made you the leader? Veeti! Hey, how about the hand gestures? - Here's a gesture for you. Ruben! What are you doing here? Try to get some rest. We'll start in the morning. Toni! We are not stealing those bikes. - Do you have money? I have five euros. - Thanks. Toni! -Aleksi, you wanted a vacation with extreme activities. This isn't quite what I meant. But... Have you done this before? - As if your morn hasn't told you. Can I cut the last one? - Definitely not! Let's go. Veeti! Stop! Hey, stop! It's the boss. - The chief of police? No, the other boss. - I have work for you. The boys have been spotted on Pindou Street. They stole three bicycles and are heading south. You have to find them before your colleagues do. We're nearby, we'll find them. - Call me as soon as you do. The gradventure begins! Did you get it? Combine Greece with adventure... - We got it. Thanks for explaining. Hide! Turn off the lights. That was close. -What if they were good cops who were searching for us? I mean it. No. The roads are too dangerous. Let's continue cross-country. Hello. - Hello. Anything? No. Adriana's phone is turned off. - Same here. We cannot reach the boys. Toni! We have to rest. - We can't. Veeti can't go on. - Yes, I can. We have no time. You stay here. I'm gonna continue. What can you do alone in the middle of the night? You also need to rest. Let's sleep a couple of hours and continue when the sun rises. Let's sleep in that cave over there. Veeti! -I can go on! We found the bicycles. - I can 't hear you. Near Asfendiou. - They will need ta rest. There are many places to hide in Dikaio. Continue to look for them. Tell me you found them. -No. The chief is getting suspicious. This is useless. - You are useless. You can't find three kids! Let's go back to the station. Okay, take out the food. What food? - I told you to bring some food. We didn't have time. Aleksi! - I avoid snacking. Hey! Make sure that the parents stay here. By any means necessary. Excuse me. I'll see how the search party is doing. But he will stay. Thank you. Thank you for everything. Hey, Veeti... - I'm hungry. Don't you have any more candy? - It won't help. My head hurts. I'm so hungry. I want mom. Everything's gonna be alright. I promise. No way! Guys! Quiet, quiet. Come on, grab some. Those chickens are on top of them. - Damn suburbanites! You have to quit stealing! - You have to quit being such a wimp. Let's leave the five euros. - No way! We have... We have five euros. This food is really good. I've never eaten anything this good. This food is very good. Do you know Greek? - Restaurant Greek and the alphabet. This is so good. Amazingly good! - Amazingly good! Hey! Grab them. Don't you know that one? -No. If you say a word at the same time, you hold hands and make a wish. But not aloud or the wish won't come true. I've made a wish now. What does Adriana's kidnapping have to with archaeological digs? Maybe Thekla can translate Ruben's conversation with the millionaire. How? Hey, Thekla. -Yes? Aleksi, write this down. Athanasios. Bravo, bravo. The treasure of Athanasios! - What is it? This is it! -In the Middle Ages there was a church full of treasure - that ships had donated in exchange for a protected voyage. Only one family of fishermen lived on the island. Now I remember! When the Ottomans attacked this area in 1522... Or 23... Or was it 27? - It doesn't matter! Anyway, the son, Athanasios, was an amazing diver. He could hold his breath for minutes on end. He hid the treasure in an underwater cave just before the Ottomans came. It's one of the greatest lost treasures in Greece. The cave has been found, but the dive is too dangerous. No one has made it there alive. Hold on. Adriana has won all sorts of diving competitions. They've found the treasure. -They're forcing Adriana to dive for them. Toni, this isn't a game anymore. They have guns. We're no match for them. It's time to get help. From who? We can't trust anyone. You don't trust anyone. You don't give anyone a chance. Think about Veeti. Okay. Let's vote. Veeti. I suggest we go to town and find someone who can help us. Tell them what we've found out. Who's with me? Okay. I suggest we do this ourselves. Who's with me? It's two against one. Let's go. - I have to go to the toilet. Greek Police. I'll connect you... Farewell. -Bye. How's it going, Veeti? - I feel like Kossing. What? -Do you get it? We're in Kos, so I said Kossing instead of cussing. Yeah, I got it. Pretty funny. You really think so? - Maybe not. Toni, that's the rental shop. - Okay. Let's go. An ATV and three bicycles have been stolen on your shift. Keep your eyes open. -Yes, dad. When you eat or are on the phone, keep them open. -Yes, dad. Even in the bathroom. - Yes, dad. Stop it with the "yes, dad". Are we clear? Finally I caught you, you thief! - Let me explain. No, I call police! - Let me explain. Then you can call police if you want. Let me explain. And you think that the police is involved in some crimes? -Yes. And your father will pay for the rent, the bikes and the quad. Yes. just take the check to him and he'll be happy to pay. I need a guarantee. - He needs some sort of collateral. Let's give him this. Don't be so childish. You can take this one. - Thank you. Make sure that this goes straight to my father, Markku. -Yes. I will think of something. - Thank you. I will give you supplies. Dad, Aleksi and Veeti are with me. Adriana has been taken to Kastri. Is that the island? Yes, I think it is. Toni! -Toni! You little devil! Let that be the last time! - What? What you just did. - It worked! You could have died. - You're not my parent. No, but you're our brother. - No, I'm not. Let's go. We're staying here. - What? We're gonna wait for the police. - What police? Did you call the police? They're gonna come and save us. - You're so childish. You think someone always comes to the rescue. But no one's corning. You can only trust yourself. Why am I even talking to you? What do you know about anything? We also know how it feels to lose a parent. Our family also broke apart. Your dad left. My mom died. You can't compare the two. Why do you think Veeti sleeps next to mom? Do you think it was easy to explain why dad let us - or why mom doesn't have the energy to do anything? But you don't care. You're the only one who needs to be understood. Don't go! We're a team. We have to stick together. That was my wish. My wish was that we would be a family. Go home. Really. In two hours everything has to be done. -Yes, yes. Hey guys, we have to... Damn it! Hi. Yes? - I have an invoice for Mr. Oksala. This is not the time. - Hold on, man. He rented a boat but didn't pay. - Leave it at the reception. I just need his signature so I can get paid. Please, do something. It's hard enough as it is. Tourists! - Tell me about it. Bill? What bill? - just read what it says. Never heard of this firm. - It's about the boat you rented. What boat? - just read what it says. What is this? You got the wrong person. What's this? Markku! What is it? Give me the bill, please. - Wait, no! Yes, it is correct. - What's wrong you? Shut up. just sign the bill. Sorry for the misunderstanding. This is correct. Sorry. Thank you. Read it. Sign here. Yes, I forgot the boat completely. "Everything's fine. Aleksi..." Okay. I have a plan. I respect the police very much. We are very grateful for your help. It's our duty. You're in good shape. Work out a lot? - We have to be in good shape. I can see that. Can you give me some tips? Do you want some fresh coffee? - Yes, please. Sorry. Get down! On the floor face down. Get down, get down! What are you doing? - Annika, the handcuffs. Markku, what are you doing? Don't open the door. - Eleni, is that you? What's going on here? Something's wrong. Four kids missing and they cannot find them. Toni asked for help and we are going to help him. With or without you. What do you want us to do? - I'll explain on the way. We can't believe that Ruben is involved. -He wouldn't hurt Adriana. Some of the police are working with them. Damn it. To get out of here we need to camouflage. -What? Oh yeah. He means to disguise ourselves. -Yes, disguise. It worked. -Of course. What next? Zaharias Markaris, Art Crime Squad. We need to talk. But first change your clothes, please. Where are the lids? Where are the sacks? It can't be opened. -Don't worry. They say that they are almost done. And then they will let us go. What? If you get a chance to escape, you must do it. One more dive and you are free. Aleksi! - Stay down! Come, come, come. Adriana, remember what I said. Last dive, as we said, okay? Untie it. Toni! Be careful. Guards. I'm sorry I got you into this. - We need to save Adriana. They said they need her just one more time. -And then... How can we save her? - We have only one option. I can't dive. -Sure you can. You just have to trust us. Toni, don't be such a douche hag. - A what? Douche hag. That's what you called us. -He called us douche bags. Why is the vessel moving? - I pulled up the anchor. You are my hero. Hey, Markku! What are you doing? Come on! It all depends on your breathing. Take long, calm breaths. When we go underwater, I'll show you the tempo. -Okay. Okay. It'll go well. Alexandra, did you find the kid? - Nat yet. We've searched almost everywhere. - How can one kid be so much trouble? Theo, is everything alright? Are you listening to me? Theo! Nâ€œ. no, no, no, no, no'.! Damn it! You brats! You have been lucky so far, but it's over now. You can choose, the gun or the ocean. You can't shoot us. - You think so? You see that island? Try to swim there. Who knows? Maybe you will make it. It's impossible. - Toni, is it possible? We can do it. Put the gun down, you are under arrest! Alexandra Costas, you are under arrest. Put the gun down, you are under arrest! Keep your hands where we see them. You are under arrest for kidnapping and illicit trade of antiquities. Aleksi! -Mom! Toni. Thanks. So... -Yes? You're the one we should be grateful to. -Well, I got some help. From your friends? No. From my brothers. Your father was a big help as well. - Really? No, it was nothing. -Yes, it was. He's my real. Bruce Willis. Yes. If you mess with my family, you're messing with me. -Right. Little heroes. Toni? See you later. See you later. I hope. -Yes. Bye. -Bye.
