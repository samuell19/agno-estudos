Facebook had just hit 100 million users, the stock market was at an all-time high, the sort of high that comes before a crash, and I was an artist working in an office on Wall Street. It wasn't a normal office. It was an entire empty floor that this nonprofit had convinced the landlord to give to a bunch of artists for free for a year. [elevator dings] And that's where my story begins. - Hey. - [Man] Hi. [Alicia narrating] Have you ever been in a completely empty floor of an office building? The names of cities still on the wall, a blank space above them where clocks once hung, a vast sea of cubicles which once held workers who spent their waking lives here. Floors marked with scuffs from shoes that walked back and forth, and back and forth. There's something post-apocalyptic about it. It's like walking through the ruins of a once-great civilization. [tuning violin] I had been applying to artists' residencies for a long time before finally getting this one. A year of free space in Manhattan was a big deal, and I wanted to make the most of it. I loved my day job teaching bat mitzvah girls how to chant from the Torah, but I thought maybe this would be the year I would finally break through as an artist. The problem was I hadn't made anything for months. I secretly hoped this new office might give me new courage. Maybe I'd create some big, ambitious performance here. Maybe it would even be marketable. But as the Yiddish saying goes, man plans and God laughs. [cars honking] The Financial District, like the rest of New York City, is an improbable combination. Gleaming and grimy, fancy and cheap, everything butted up against each other, jostling for a space. Each day, I'd ride my bike in from Brooklyn over the Williamsburg Bridge, down through the Lower East Side, past the tenement buildings where my great-grandparents once lived. [elevator beeping] [elevator dings] [soft string music] Then one day I saw a man in the office across the street. He put his head down on his desk and left it there for a long time. [Woman on radio] We begin with Wall Street, and the news today isn't getting any better. [loud voices of traders on radio] [Man #1 on radio] There's just panic in the air. [Man #2] Wall Street treated the American economy like a casino. [Man #3] Not in generations has Wall Street absorbed the number of body blows it took today. [Man #4] The American financial system is rocked to its foundation as top Wall Street institutions topple under a mountain of debt. [Man #5] It is definitely a very, very difficult time, and it's not gonna get better quickly. [Alicia narrating] And then Bernie Madoff turned himself in. His 40-year hedge fund was actually a giant Ponzi scheme, the largest financial crime in history. [Woman #1 on radio] Until this week, Bernie Madoff was a lion of Wall Street. He managed one of the most successful hedge funds, then FBI agents... [Woman #2] "$50 billion Ponzi scheme..." [Woman #3] One of the biggest Ponzi schemes ever is reverberating throughout the world today... [Man #6] ...The NASDAQ stock market. Many people are starting to believe it may have been from the very beginning. [Woman #4] How could he pull this off by himself? [Man #6] It seems almost impossible. [Woman #5] All fake, all fake. A novel. [Interviewer on radio] Your statement's a novel? [Woman #5] Yes, unfortunately. [sighs] Oh, my God. He looks like my dad. He has kind eyes. [sighs] [Alicia narrating] And that was the beginning of my obsession with Bernie Madoff. We were a community of artists on the ninth floor with ink on our fingers and paint on our faces. We each had our projects, our insecurities, our secret fears. As for me, I couldn't stop talking about the giant fraud that happened right down the street. - [Patricia] Hey. - Hey. Nice Christmas lights. Thanks. [Patricia] What's he doing on your wall? The whole thing is crazy. He grew up in Long Island without much money, he got mediocre grades, he married his high school sweetheart Ruth. He's like a totally normal guy. He started his financial business with money he saved up life guarding and installing sprinkler systems. [Patricia] Huh. [Alicia] Doesn't make sense. He never studied economics or finance, but his company helped invent the computer trading system that modernized the stock market. And even when he got rich, he didn't flaunt it, not by the standards of Wall Street. He was more like some friendly uncle people trusted with their money. - Hm. - He was this big philanthropist, but all the money he gave away was stolen money. He made this whole thing up from scratch, and he brought his two sons into the office to work for him. Wow. - [people chattering] - [upbeat indie rock music] [Alicia narrating] As fall turned to winter, I'm sure my growing obsession made me pretty annoying to my fellow artists, but by the time of our January artists' salon, Bernie Madoff was starting to work his way into other people's lives, too. Is he a sociopath or just a common criminal? I know. And get this. I just found out my best friend's grandfather put him through college with the money - he earned from Madoff. - What? My boyfriend's uncle's a lawyer, and he's representing three of the victims. [gasps] Holy shit. I'm one degree from Bernie Madoff. [phone ringing] - Hey, Mom. - Hey, honey. Remember my college roommate Evelyn? She works in finance, and boy does she have a Madoff story for you! [Alicia narrating] I met with Evelyn in her office just a few blocks from mine.

And she said, "Evelyn, I've been watching Madoff for years." Something's wrong there. I don't know what. It could be insider trading, it could be fake returns.

Everything is created by a series of causes and conditions. - [soft music] - [leaves rustling] [Alicia narrating] News of Madoff's crimes continued to unfold. Stories came in from all over the country and they started to draw me into these weird little worlds like Palm Beach, Florida, one of the hardest hit places where a lot of people lost a lot of money. [phone ringing] Hello. Hi. This is Alicia. You said you'd be willing to talk to me? It's that girl. Country clubs here didn't allow Jews in until 1965. So we made our own country club. The Madoffs had a house here in Palm Beach, and they belonged to that Jewish country club. People would join just to get close to Bernie to get a chance to possibly invest with him. Mm-hmm. My best friend lost everything. What do you think the rabbi did at services that week? I don't know. - I never go. - Me, neither. Actually, I have this friend. She plays accordion. Her mom lives down in West Palm Beach across the tracks, and she told me the congregation recited the Kaddish for Bernie Madoff. [Woman] Maybe they should. Mm-hmm. The ladies got me wondering, should we all be saying a Kaddish for Bernie Madoff? If you don't know the Kaddish prayer, this might not sound like such a crazy idea. But here's the thing. The Kaddish is one of the holiest Jewish prayers. We use it as a prayer for the dead, although there's no mention of death in it at all. The words are in ancient Aramaic and they're all about praising God... May God be glorified and exalted and raised up and blessed. According to tradition, saying this prayer helps a dead person's soul ascend to heaven. You don't say a Kaddish for someone who's alive, except in one extremely rare case: excommunication. [women gasp] If you were to excommunicate someone you'd observe all the mourning rituals as if they had actually died, but that's a rare and ancient practice, and it's not the sort of thing you expect to find in Palm Beach. And yet it did seem like something ancient was happening here, something of our time, but also beyond it. So I started looking for old ideas about possessions and loss and what really matters, ideas from before Bernie Madoff, before Wall Street, before America, and I started turning them into songs. [soft violin music] Blossoms come about because a series of conditions lead up to their blooming. Blossoms do not appear independently, nor does a leaf fall of itself out of its season, so everything has its coming forth and passing away. Nothing can be independent without any change. ♪ It is the everlasting ♪ ♪ And unchanging rule ♪ ♪ Of this world ♪ ♪ That everything is created ♪ ♪ By a series of causes and conditions ♪ ♪ By a series of causes and conditions ♪ ♪ And everything disappears ♪ ♪ By the same rule ♪ ♪ Everything changes ♪ ♪ Nothing remains constant ♪ 90 years after my great-grandparents came to America from Eastern Europe, my family was still Jewish but not really religious at all, and we were the only Jewish family in our neighborhood, so I didn't know much about my culture until I turned 20 and got curious. Now, being Jewish was a big part of my identity, and usually that made me proud. But when I thought about Bernie Madoff, I felt shame. What did it mean that he was from my tribe, that he literally shared my DNA? And what about Wall Street? Shouldn't they have known something was wrong? Was he that much of a genius, or did they look the other way? I had to understand more. Conveniently, a whole mini industry of Madoff books had just begun to emerge. They always had these pithy subtitles, like The Magician of Lies: How Bernie Madoff Killed Trust or The Madoff Secret: Behind Closed Doors on the 17th Floor. My favorite was a best seller by the Madoff whistleblower. It was called I Tried to Tell Them: a True Crime In Modern Finance. [upbeat music] The author was a quant, a math genius working on Wall Street, using equations to make money for his firm. He wrote... [Man] I kept getting in trouble with my bosses because I couldn't match Madoff's returns. Then I started looking into how he did it. It didn't take long to realize the whole thing had to be a fraud. Listen, back in 2005, I handed the government a detailed report entitled "The World's Largest Hedge Fund Is a Fraud." The government ignored me.

This one time he arrived at his London office to find they had installed a video conferencing center with a curved wall, and he flew into a rage and demanded they tear it down, like, "I can't live with it. It has to be square!" [upbeat music] [toilet flushes] But he rented three floors of the Lipstick Building, which is an oval. I guess the 18th and 19th floors were a legitimate trading business he ran with his two sons. Meanwhile, on the 17th floor, they were, like, making up numbers and doing all the Ponzi stuff. And get this. My friend Tim has this uncle who's an FBI agent who worked on the case, and he agreed to tell me what he saw... On the 17th floor. I wasn't just obsessed with Bernie Madoff. I was obsessed with anyone who had a connection to him, and they kept coming one after the other. I interviewed them, went back to my studio, and turned their stories into songs. I was being sucked deeper and deeper into my obsession.

[soft orchestral music] So I called my friend's mom back and asked her to tell me more, but she had no idea what I was talking about. [soft orchestral music] [All] There was hugging and crying among the victims, but there was no Kaddish for Madoff. But I remembered her telling me that. I mean, I heard her say it. Did I imagine it? Did I dream it? Or was it some ancient Jewish memory of excommunication surfacing? Either way, the truth is I hated thinking about Madoff as a Jew. I mean, he's pretty much the definition of bad for the Jews. - Mm-hmm. - Hm. But you know, on Yom Kippur, we recite these confessional prayers where we go down the Hebrew alphabet listing the sins we've committed, and we say them all in the plural. Ashamnu, Bagadnu, Gazalnu, Dibarnu Dofi. We have been adulterous, we have betrayed. We have committed slander, we have deceived. There's this idea that even though no one person could possibly have done all these things wrong, as a community, we are responsible for each other. We are all connected. A Kabbalistic text. God is one. God's secret is one. The entire chain of being is one. Down to the last link, everything is linked with everything else. Divine essence is below as well as above, in heaven and on earth, there is nothing else. I felt stuck. What should we do with him? Excommunication or radical compassion? We could say a Kaddish and be done with him forever. But if the mystics are right and we're all connected, maybe this story was bigger than any one person. Dear Bernie... You went from being one of the geniuses of Wall Street to a total pariah. And there's this in-between time between your confession and your sentencing. You're under house arrest with your wife Ruth in your Upper East Side apartment. You're holed up in this perfect world you created while everything crumbles around you. Your sons, Andy and Mark, who worked for you most of their lives, are no longer speaking to you. Paparazzi are swarming the block. And during this time, you write a letter of apology to the residents of your building and have it slipped beneath their doors, as if you still might be the president of your building's condo board, as if things might still be okay. [soft orchestral music] Dear neighbors... ♪ Please accept ♪ ♪ My profound ♪ ♪ Apologies ♪ ♪ For the terrible ♪ ♪ Inconvenience ♪ ♪ I have caused ♪ ♪ Over the past weeks ♪ ♪ Ruth and I ♪ ♪ Appreciate ♪ ♪ The support ♪ ♪ We have ♪ ♪ Received ♪ Okay. [soft violin music] And then I did what any artist does when something drives them crazy... I made it into art. I would take all these stories swirling around in my head and try to make sense out of them. It was still a mess, but now it would be my mess. One day, maybe I'd show my work to the world, but first I'd subject my friends to it. Would they like it? Would it be any good? Or had I totally lost it? It was 4:00 in the morning. I was almost too tired to care. Almost. [soft violin music] [people chattering] His returns were not spectacular. What was spectacular was the consistency. Markets go up, markets go down. But Madoff's returns went up in a straight line, more or less, for 40 years. Who wouldn't want that kind of security? No downturn, just growth. No failure, no loss. It's beautiful. But they were just making up numbers on the 17th floor. Each day they'd wait until the trading day ended, decide how much the accounts should be worth, then create false reports of trades that never happened based on the actual stock trading prices. Now, many people assume that Madoff's victims simply handed their money over and walked away. But that was not the case with the people I talked to. [soft cello] Follow me. [people chattering] Ooh.

Imagine saving up for years, then waking up one morning and checking your account balance, and it's just zero. [melancholy music] Zero isn't just about money. It's about lies and betrayal, and in a society where we don't take care of the elderly, it's also about survival. A lot of people think only the super wealthy invested with Madoff, but he had a lot of middle-class investors, too. Many of them used their accounts like a 401k. Each month they'd put a little in so they'd have enough to live off when they retired, and then it all just disappeared. [bubbling cauldron] By this point, the scam had gone on for so long that many of his investors were over 70 and already retired. The lucky ones had family who could take them in or were healthy enough to start working again. "I'm taking care of my sick mother-in-law," one 73-year-old victim wrote The New York Times. "My wife has cancer. I just can't deal with it. I'm cooked." Dear Bernie... You will be cursed in the city and cursed in the country. Your basket and your kneading trough will be cursed.

Charles Ponzi, the original Ponzi schemer, was an Italian immigrant who targeted other Italian-Americans. So it's not a coincidence that most of Madoff's victims were the sons and daughters and grandchildren of Jewish immigrants who came here with very little. Like Madoff's family. We trust people who are like us.

After one flip, you're down to 50 people, after two flips 25, after seven or eight flips, you're down to maybe one guy who's flipped heads every single time.

How was the economy supposed to keep growing and growing forever? I still felt some shame about Madoff being Jewish, but now I understood this was common. When someone from a majority culture commits a crime, we see them as a person. But when they're from a minority group, there's a false sense that they represent that culture and others from the group often feel a sense of responsibility for something they had nothing to do with. At the same time on the deepest human level, I was starting to think we all had a little bit of Bernie Madoff inside us, the temptation to give people what they want, tell them what they want to hear, instead of dealing with reality. Dear Bernie, you're probably a grade A jackass like the lawyer said, but you couldn't have done it alone. You needed a whole system to support you, a whole way of life. You needed a culture where people don't have to look out for one another. Where our job is just to survive. Where the only way to be safe... To make a lot of money and put it somewhere far away where no one could touch it, where we know it'll be there waiting for us one day far off in the future, when we really need it. [tense violin music] $65 billion dollars lost. Retirement savings drained of every cent. Entire charities emptied out. Universities struggling to survive. Pension funds depleted. And three people who took their own lives when the curtain was pulled away... a French nobleman who lost a billion dollars of his clients' money, a British veteran who lost his family's life savings, and Bernie and Ruth's older son Mark. He worked on the 19th floor and claimed he never knew what happened on the 17th, but no one believed him. He became a pariah in the finance world like his father. No one would hire him. He was repeatedly sued. He hanged himself on the second anniversary of his father's arrest. Four years later, his brother Andrew died of cancer. [soft violin music] Winter turned to spring. The banks got bailed out. The Southern district of New York City gave Bernie Madoff 150 years in jail.

I talked to a Buddhist monk the other day. He also happens to be a Jew. I thought maybe he could help me. And he said... [Monk] You could almost say Madoff was delivering the Messiah. This is the era of perfection. The faithful will enter into it, but in Judaism, the Messiah is in the future. And as for you, Alicia, you want me to explain this, but you can't understand what happened without looking at yourself, your own desire for control, your wish to succeed, to be safe, never to stumble, never to fail.

Before we said goodbye, I needed to create one final performance, a ritual excommunication, a Kaddish for Bernie Madoff. We'd use the mourning customs of the Jewish people to say goodbye to him and everything he represented because he was dead to us. He was human, but he'd lost his humanity. I was saying goodbye to something else, too, something closer to home: the Bernie Madoff inside each of us, the perfectionist who would do anything for control, the part of me that was terrified of admitting my mistakes, my failures. I finally understood, confronting Bernie was confronting myself. A world without failure, a line that goes up and up. It's beautiful, but it's impossible. In the Kabbalistic creation myth, even God messes up. [soft violin picking] ♪ Bring me your empty jar ♪ ♪ I will fill it, I will fill it ♪ ♪ Where it comes from, where it goes ♪ ♪ I can't tell you, no one knows ♪ At first God was everywhere, just this infinite light without any interruption. And in order to create anything, God had to withdraw, making a sort of black hole at the center of the universe. And in that space, God made a world of small clay vessels, but they were inanimate. So for the final step, God channeled divine energy into the vessels to give them life, but the vessels couldn't handle the power of the light. They couldn't sustain it. So they cracked and they shattered and they fell down, and that's the world. The world is broken, a collection of fallen shards, each with a little bit of light trapped at its center, a little spark of divine energy. And our job as we move through the world is to find those sparks. Do you know how medieval Jews would excommunicate someone convicted of a terrible crime? First, they would gather. Then they would blow the shofar, the ram's horn, in front of the Torah. They would lament, holding candles of mourning. The rabbi would shout biblical curses at the person being excommunicated. He would warn the community never to speak to that person again. The people would cry, and they would extinguish their candles. Dear Bernie, I wrote this Kaddish for you.

But I knew there was no way to separate myself entirely from any of it. The money, the stock market, my fellow artists, everyone I'd interviewed, America, the whole world. Everything was connected. Soon some business would rent out this floor and use it to make money. My fellow artists and I would scatter across New York City, each of us looking for some other space where we could try to make sense of the world around us. Bernie Madoff himself would leave this earth, but another scam artist would rise to take his place, and we would do what we always do. [All] Amen. Look at the world around us and make beauty out of the brokenness. [soft music] [soft classical music] [upbeat jazzy music] [somber music]
