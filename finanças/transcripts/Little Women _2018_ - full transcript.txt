"For centuries, the dark hand of Narash has been spreading across the borderlands, ruling with blood and necromancy. Are you the chosen one to challenge him, to crush his bones into dust, and pry out his innards with the tip of your sword?" Beth, film me. Meg, you look like a boy. - Yes! I am the... - That's my part. I just wanted to make sure you did it right. This is the pivotal point for your character. - Just let me do it my way. - But I'm the director. Hi, Amy. - Okay, fine. - Try it again. "I am the rightful paladin. Tell me my path, Lord Gillian, I shall fulfill my prophecy." "You must travel beyond the catacombs of Eryx, through the valley of Guell, and climb the denizen steps where no human has dared to venture." "Ever dared to venture, yet." Uh, it's more like: "Ever dared to venture, yet!" In order to continue, you must offer sacrifice to Rian, a dark fairy of the Killian order. "You must bring me the dragon scale relic of the forgotten droids." Druids! Whatever. - "Do you accept?" - "I am not afraid." She turned and said farewell, floating bravely forth, on her long, unknown journey, far away. End book one. Hey, Jo, do the epilogue! But we've heard it a million times! It's my favorite part. The people have spoken. It is not enough for the brave heroine to desire greatness. No, even the lowliest serf in the kingdom may desire greatness. For our heroine to succeed, she must demand greatness. To snatch it from the powers that be and wave it over the parapet for all to see. To prove that she is their queen, and the magnificent rightful heir to her birthright. Uh, well, thank you, Josephine. Oh, it's just Jo. You certainly gave us an entertaining read. Uh, listen, it's not my taste per se, but I could see how it could appeal to others. - What are you going for? Young adult fantasy? - Uh, no. It can't be Y.A. There's no love story. - It's not a love story. - Then it's definitely a pass for me. - Yeah, it's a pass for me as well. - Me too, sweetie. You have a very creative mind. But, there's something missing in the authenticity. I can't hear your voice. It's not about me! All the same, it's still gonna be a pass. Professor? Yeah, it's a pass from me as well. Thanks. No, thank you. Really I... I appreciate you judging my artistic aptitude on three pages of my 400-page novel.

I'm sorry. Can you just hold? I am here! From whence come you, and whither are you bound? We have traveled from the city of desolation through the fires of purgatory, fighting beasts of the night. - We seek access to the city of Zion. - Ooh. Hmm. You may release your burdens. But you must each sacrifice one valuable to the altar. But choose carefully. Be not selfish! Whatever you select must be of great value. Good. Yes. - Hair? - It's valuable to me. Hmm. Your castles await you. - Go! - Except for Amy. Oh. - Hey! - Oh. Ah. Hello? Thanks for holding. I'm so sorry. Hey, let me in! No! You cheated! You don't deserve to be in the castle! - Just let her in. - She has to play by the rules! It's just a game. - Let me in! - It's not a game to me! - Let me in! - Let her in. All my sisters are allowed in my castle. Mine too. - Oh, my goodness. - This is so cool. Mine's pink! "Welcome to your castles in the air. Fill them wisely. Love Marmee." - Jo, what's in your castle? - Well, I want a lot of things. - I, Jo March... - I, Jo March... I, Jo March... I'll get out of this town and move to the big city. I, Jo March, will be a very successful writer and will buy a big house in the city so we can all live together. I don't want to live with you forever! I want to get married and have kids and... And have a nanny, and a maid, and... a butler! - Amy, that's stupid. - Hey, you can't judge other people's castles. Fine. Then I change the rules of mine. Only Beth and I are allowed in my castle. Hey! I, Jo March, will be a very successful writer, and will visit every single country and eat out every single meal. Oh, and I will see every play and musical and opera ever written. Or will be written ever. I think that's too long. I, Jo March, will be a very successful writer and will... do all the things. My turn. I, Amy March, will be... a rich and famous painter so I can... buy whatever I want and go wherever I want. Amy. I, Margaret March, will have a family of my own, and, um, just be... well, happy. And? And nothing. - Beth? - I, Elizabeth March... I, Elizabeth March... I don't know what to say. Just... think about what you want to be when you grow up. Well, I think this is my castle. - The attic? - Just being here with all of you. Okay, Beth. Yeah, that's really sweet. We'll take it. Let's make an oath. - Okay. - Yeah. All right. To always help each other reach our castles. No matter where they may be. "Everybody gets a prize" mentality. - My principles could be... - No. Not everybody wins. Hey, excuse me! Excuse me. - Professor Bhaer. - Oh, dear. Hey! - It's dragon lady. - Professor Bhaer! - Good luck with that. - I need to talk to you. Just Jo, with the fantasy novel, right? It's a high-fantasy mythopoeic fable. Sorry I'm not more familiar with that genre. Yeah, neither was your panel of patriarchs in there. Which, you know, I might expect from some of those hacks, but not from you. Not from someone with your résumé. It doesn't matter. I will find my audience, no thanks to Columbia or Hooton Muffin or however you say it. - I'm sure you will. - You probably didn't even understand that the protagonist - is actually a girl who dresses up as a boy. - I didn't. And when I was growing up, I dressed up as a boy. I was inspired by my "authentic self," you see? I really think you would have understood that and possibly even enjoyed it a little, had you heard more than a measly three-minute reading in a synthetic, almost hostile environment, where the critiques were really more about subjective capitalistic conjecture than a chance for writers to be discovered. I'd be happy to read more of your novel. You would? Oh, yes! Thank you! I've been wanting anyone... everyone... to read it. Besides my sister. Freddy, by the way. Freddy Bhaer. Here. Contact info, title page. E-mail would have been fine. No. You have to hold the words, let them seep into your skin. All right. I'll be expecting your call. Hey, it's Freddy. I'm just, uh, checking in. I haven't heard from you. I know that notes can be overwhelming. Keep your chin up. Let me know when you have another draft. Josephine? Good heavens, child. It smells like a Turkish bath in here. If you're going to quarantine yourself in this room for weeks on end, the least you could do is crack a window. The least you could do is knock. Oh, I'm your employer, and I'm supposed to knock? How very millennial of you. Dinner's at 6:00. I don't want her to starve while you escape into your Neverwood Forest or whatever you're scribbling about. I will do my best. Well, I sure hope that's enough. Love you too, Aunt March. Honey, it's Mom, just wanting to know how your meetings went. So exciting. I bet they were busy fighting over who gets to publish Concord's own Jo March. Anyway, I know you're busy, but just check in and let us know when you're coming home for Christm... This is going to be the worst Christmas ever. All my friends at school get a whole pile of presents, and we get nothing. Well, we each get one gift, and that's more than most people get. You want to know what I asked for? Do not say a bra. New paintbrushes! There he is again! I heard he just moved here from Europe. Maybe he was forced to move here, after stowing away on the Trans-Siberian railroad. Marmee said his parents just died in a car accident. He doesn't have any siblings, - so now he has to live with his grandfather. - How sad. He's kind of cute, though. I mean, I guess, for an old guy. I don't think I could ever live in that creepy house. Mr. Laurence is so scary. Oh, maybe Mr. Laurence isn't his grandfather. He's the new kid's vampire mentor, and he's trying to tame his ravishing appetite. Wait, that is really good. We should do something nice for them. - Maybe we could bake them something. - Yes! ♪ Angels we have heard on high ♪ Ooh. Amy, let's wait till everyone gets here, okay? But I'm starving! You continue to use that word incorrectly. - You know what I mean. - Actually, I don't. - Shut up, Jo. - Good morning! Oh, it smells like Christmas in here. - You're back! - How was the shelter? - Well... - There were so many people there, we didn't have enough food for everyone. See Amy? Those people are starving. But not if they like cupcakes. - Oh! - I'll grab my costumes. We can do the nativity musical! Oh! No, no, no, no, no. Not the cupcakes! Can we just be a normal family and eat breakfast and open presents at home? I'll get that. - Oh, hi. - Hi. - Hey, hi. - Hi. - Oh! - I think this one's yours. Yeah. - Thank you so much. - There you go. Fat ol' Goob is always running away. - Yeah. - Dove? Where are you? Dove? I thought you called him Goob. Oh, I'm Dove. I mean, I'm Meg. But my family... That's what they call me. I'm John Brooke. I live next door with the Laurences. - Oh. - You don't look like a Laurence. - This is my sister, Jo. - Yeah, I'm just a family friend of the Laurences. Mr. Laurence hired me to tutor his grandson. Math, music and whatever else. - That's nice. - So the new kid has a manny. Nope. Just a tutor. Right. Okay, yeah. Well, uh, we have to go help some poor people. - Oh. - So we'll catch you later. Merry Christmas. - Mm, bye! - Merry Christmas. - Goob, buddy. Get off the computer. - Oops, sorry, Dad. Rascal. - Come here, Goob. - What do you got for me, Amy? Okay. This one is Marmee's favorite. - Wow. - She says it's very "ethetically" pleasing. - Aesthetically. - Aesthetically. Well done. Amy, that's beautiful. You're getting so good! Thank you. - Did I show you this one? - No. No, no, no. Your time is up! - Jo. - No. Come on! Time is up! - Move. - Hey, you guys. Thank you. Hi, Dad. Okay, really quick question. Uh, when you first cut into a liver, is the blood that seeps out, is it more crimson or maroon? Writing a murder mystery, are we? - No, it's a post-apocalyptic zombie thriller. - Whoa. Uh, crimson, I would say. But I only operate on humans. - So I don't really know about zombie blood. - Okay. Thank you. All right, listen up, girls. I only have a minute left. Jo, I'm going to put you in charge of the club this year. So here's your marching orders. Your first assignment of the year will be to write your grievances every week and come up with a plan as to how to fix them. That way, you can be strong, kind, independent little women like your mother. - Is that clear? - Sir, yes, sir! Good. At ease, soldiers. I love you guys so much. - Hey, where's my beautiful Marmee? - Marmee! - I need to see her one more time. - Hi. Ah, there she is. Hi, Marmee. - I love you so much. - Love you, Dad! Merry Christmas, you guys. I miss you so much. I'll think about you every day. I promise. Merry Christmas, Dad! - Take care of your mom. I love you. - Always. Bye. Fifteen! Sixteen! Seventeen! Say it with me, ladies! Eighteen! Nineteen! Twenty! All right. Fall in, soldiers! As Staff Sergeant of the Pickwick Club, I request a read of the earthly grievances of each of our members as requested by our commander-in-chief. Staff Sergeant Snodgrass. Your clothes and notebooks are everywhere and when asked to clean it up, you launched an airborne Cabbage Patch at Private Winkle's head! You're lucky that you missed. With all due respect, who's the lucky one? - Soldier... - Apologies, Private. Duly noted. Corporal Tupman. Though we love your feline companion, we request that you fulfill your kitty litter duties and pick up the litter box since the stench is considered to be highly offensive. Can do, sir. Private Winkle. It has been reported that on multiple occasions, you have stolen toilet paper out of the latrine, with the express purpose of stuffing your shirt. You are so mean! On the contrary. We wish only to help you enjoy your youthful freedom, for you will soon come to know the cumbersome and unwieldy nature of a full chest. - Like you would know. - Private Winkle! General Pickwick! It has been noted that you have not visited the shelter all week because of frequent flirtations with the manny. So you must go twice next week. Sir, yes, sir. Josephine, what on earth is going on here? Wha... Sorry. I'm... I'm just, uh... trying to lay everything out, see everything. I'm not talking about your little story. I'm talking about the fact that Katinka's water bowl is bone dry, and she pooped in the entryway. - Serious? I just took her out. - When? Last Christmas? - What am I paying you for? - I'm sorry my life doesn't revolve around your dog. Well, what does it revolve around, exactly? Hmm? Trolls? Dragons? Cross-dressing pirates? I don't mean to hurt your feelings. I'm just worried about you is all. Is this really the life you want? The life of... insecurity? Yes. What if the professor doesn't like this version or the next? - He will. - I hate to see you working so hard when it could all come to nothing. There's no shame in changing your mind. You're still... youngish. It's not too late to pursue something with a little more promise in it. I know it doesn't look like much right now, but you are going to be sorry you ever doubted me. I certainly hope so. Just think about a plan "B." - I knew it. You hate the new beginning. - No. I liked it. A lot, actually. But then I've always been a fan of A Wrinkle in Time. I am trying to get inspired by the greats. Isn't that what artists do? Yes. And then they tell their own stories. - Was it at least better than the last time you read it? - It was. But... Am I a hopeless case? Please just tell me now. Save me the heartache. You know, there are other things I could do. I do have marketable skills. I could be a nanny till the day I croak. I love books. I-I should be an old spinster librarian who reads saucy romance novels under her desk. I'm sure you'll find time for both. You are not helping! I'm not your therapist. I'm your editor. I'm not going to pity an artist for taking their stripes. You signed up for this struggle the moment you called yourself a writer. I have a feeling you'd be bored with anything less. You're good, Jo. You're a good writer. But now that I've gotten to know you, as a person, you are far more interesting than what you write. I want to be reading... more of this. More of you. Me? I am not interesting! Hell, I'm 29 years old. And I live alone in Queens while I work for my great aunt. I still haven't been to Europe. I haven't been marooned on a desert island. I haven't been falsely accused of murder. I haven't even been a victim of identify theft! If... If my younger self could see me now, she'd straight up join a nunnery because at least then her life would have purpose. Actually, that is not a bad idea. Do nuns take old people like me? See? More of this. Where are you going? Thanks to you, I have a whole new draft to start. We could talk about something else. It doesn't always have to be about your work. I don't have time to sit and chat. If my muse isn't going to visit me, I am going to find her and knock her dumb door down. Maybe I can help. You guys... My nose won't stop growing! - I need a nose job. - Take that ridiculous thing off. You don't know what it's like to have everyone else make fun of your nose. What is it gonna be like when you cut off your circulation and your nose falls off? - You'd look like Voldemort. - Oh! That would be awesome. Why can't I go to the New Year's Eve party? You can go to all the parties you want when you're older. For now, you can stay home and watch the ball drop with Marmee and Beth. - Does that sound like any fun to you? - Yes. It's not. I'm the worst. I always fall asleep before midnight. Yeah! You see what I mean? Beth is so boring! And I could care less about watching a ball drop. - Couldn't care less. - What's the difference? Well, if you could care less, that means you care a little bit about the ball dropping. - I don't. - Okay, look. I think you're lucky. I would rather pass a kidney stone than go to this freakin' party. - You have to come with me. You promised. - I'll go! You're too young! Can I at least pick out your outfit? No, I'm wearing this. You'll never get a boyfriend. That's the plan. - I don't want a boyfriend. Boys are gross. I... - What's that smell? Jo! - Are you kidding me? - I'm sorry! You should have never let me do this! - Meg, Meg, Meg. - Say "sorry"! You can just cover it up with a headband. You still look so pretty. It's not that bad, is it? - No. - Not at all. I don't like looking at myself in the mirror. Me neither. You get used to it. Jo, why don't you wear one too? You can match Meg. I'm not wearing a stupid headband. You don't even like Sally Moffat, and her, like, giggly little brat pack. - They're not that bad. - They talk about the stupidest things. And her brother always gives me the weirdest looks. Let's go get pizza instead and say that we didn't. Jo, listen. I'm sick of being the weird home-schooled sisters. I want to make friends and go to parties and talk to guys our own age. Why? Because I just do! And I really need you to be my wing woman. Wing woman reporting for duty. ♪ It's Saturday night And I'm feeling real good ♪ I am so glad you're here.

I just want to see a movie with my sister. You just want to see a movie with Laurie. She's so obsessed with you. It's sickening. I hate you! Hey, it's not too late. You wanna go to Scoops maybe? Laurie, no. I don't have time to go get ice cream right now. I am so inspired by that movie! Inspired? I thought you said you hated it. I did. But it just inspired me to write something better. 'Cause if that crap is getting made into movies, my scripts are going to crush it. Oh, I thought you were a novelist, not a screenwriter. I am. I just... I'm gonna do both. How hard can it be? Have you seen my notebook? You know, I don't know why you don't just use my old laptop. What would happen if it randomly deleted all of my work? But a hard copy, you never lose. - Well, except for right now. - It is not lost. It is misplaced. Okay, uh, guess I'll... see you later then? Okay, bye. Still moping? Still looking for something? Give me that! Amy! Amy! Amy! Give me that. Amy, give me that. Amy! Amy! - Open the door, you little brat! - You should have let me come! - No one wanted you there! - Laurie said he did! He also said he liked your paintings, but he lied so you don't cry about it. Why do you have to be so difficult? - He's my friend too! - No, he's not. He thinks you're stupid and immature, just like the rest of us do. No! I'm going to kill you! - What's going on? - She burned it! Burned what? Put that down! My notebook! What is wrong with you? You! Go to your room. Honey. Honey. I'm sorry. Hey... I will never write like that again! I know you're angry right now and I get it. It's going to take some time to heal. But I promise you, the longer it takes for you to forgive her, the longer your pain will last. All right, Rene, you ready for a wild ride into the sunset? Come on. Crap. Buckle on the cinch is busted. We'll have to double up. Serious? What? Do you think I want to ride with you? - It's either this or we can't go. - Fine. We only have an hour of daylight. - Come on. - Come on. Jo! Laurie! Guys! I wanna come with! Jo! Jo! Wait up! Hold up, guys! Guys, wait! Jo!

Please. Easy, easy. Amy. - Amy! - Easy. Easy, easy. Oh, my God. Amy. Amy! Jo, it's okay. Hold this. Hold this on her. Hold it right there. I'm gonna go get some help. - No. Amy. - It's okay. - Amy. - Come on. Amy. You're gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay. Please. Help. Amy. I just wanted to come with you. I know. I should have let you. I'm sorry I destroyed your journal. I don't care about the journal. Okay, I so cared about the journal. It was my entire life's work. How can I not? But, I'd rather lose every word I ever wrote than lose you. That's a lot of words. I'll write a heck of a lot more. Maybe this will help. Amy. I know that sometimes you might not like me much, but... No. Do not say that. We are just... different. And know what 'tis to pity. Let gentleness my strong enforcement be, in the which hope I blush and hide my sword. True it is that we have seen better days and have with holy bell been knolled to church. I like watching the rehearsals. Well, the Duke needs to step it up. He's still not off book. Just let the creative process inspire you. Or just try to enjoy it. I will have you know I love plays, I just hate this monologue. What? How? Why? It's beautiful. Beautiful? It's depressing. All the world's a stage and all the men and women merely players. They have their exits and entrances, and one man in his time plays many parts. It is one of Bill's most depressing soliloquies. I like to think a life is a bit more meaningful than playing a part on a stage. Shining morning face creeping like a snail unwillingly to school. - I don't see it that way at all. - No? Please enlighten me, Professor Bhaer. I think it's about growth and accepting change. We come into this world perfect. Then we go through all these stages of learning, shifting, changing, breaking even. And we become something new, something... far from perfect but perfectly unique. I find that inspiring. I guess that is one way to think about it. "Last scene of all, that ends this strange history, is second childishness and mere oblivion, sans teeth, sans taste, sans every... thing." I'm scared. You have a hundred letters in your hand. Open 'em. One will be a yes. I still can't believe you only applied to one school. When you're meant for the best, you don't settle for less. I'd settle for UMass Lowell at this point. Just open them. I can't. You do it. - Okay. - Uh, start with this one. Okay. Right. "Mr. Laurie Laurence, thank you for your application to Stanford University. We are pleased to announce your acceptance for the fall semester." - I got in? - Yes! I knew you would. I can't believe it! Yes. Let's open the rest. Oh! Throw 'em away! Burn 'em! I don't care. I'm going to Stanford! Okay, okay. Your turn. You do the honors. With pleasure. "Miss Josephine March, We thank you for your interest in the University of Oxford. It is with regret that..." Jo, I'm sorry. You've got to get goin'. You're going to miss orientation. Stanford waits for no man. It's not fair. - You're so much smarter than me. - It's fine. I'm gonna hang out here, write a few novels and hang out with Beth. You're gonna be back before we know it. - I'll text you when I get there. - Yeah. Do all the things for me. I will. ♪ Come join me ♪ ♪ Within the belly Of the big blue sea ♪ ♪ Set a sail Catch a breeze ♪ ♪ Come on ♪ ♪ Don't forget To fill your suitcase ♪ ♪ Now watch it sink 'Cause where we're going We don't need a thing ♪ See you soon. ♪ Not a map or receipt ♪ ♪ 'Cause where we've been Is who we used to be ♪ ♪ We started wrapping Our regrets in cloth ♪ ♪ Are you defined By all the things you want? ♪ ♪ Or did you get caught ♪ ♪ Up in the things That we are not? ♪ It's so good.

What if Marek was actually a girl, who dresses up as a boy to make her journey safer, but then by the third act she can no longer hide? Beth. That is genius! I think that Clarissa should still fall in love with the Prince. It's not a love story! Isn't everything? Overall, though, I loved it. I don't think I'll ever be as good at anything as you are at writing. You're way better at being a good human. I can help you with that. Oh, and piano. Mmm. Can't help you there. You're pretty much hopeless. I just... I want to write something that won't be forgotten after I die. You will. I know it. - It's the one. - What do you mean? You know. The draft to send out to publishers? Jo. I-I don't... - It's not quite ready. - How do you know? You haven't finished it yet. I just know. It's a grueling process. Listen. Madeleine L'Engle racked up 26 rejections before Wrinkle was published. Is that supposed to make me feel better? It's supposed to give you perspective. Even Freddy Bhaer wrote an impressive 14 novels before he was published. Oh, "Freddy Bhaer." Wow. You love throwing your name in there, right? Is it any good? Some say yes. The New Yorker said "lacks linguistic vision," so... You should read it sometime. I will. Right after you send off my draft. Maybe... Maybe it's time to take a break from this one. Work on something new. Something new? I've been working on this for ten years. That's exactly why it might be helpful to try working on something else for a change. So you're not going to help me? What do you think I've been doing? I don't know, actually. Why do you spend so much time with me if you don't think I can do it? I didn't say that, and I thought we liked spending time together. That's beside the point! Is it? Josephine. - I have to go. - We need to talk about this. I don't want to talk about it. Marmee, I just want to say before you say anything... Listen to me. It's back. You have to eat it! I don't wanna eat it. It's so gross! You asked for a dare! Don't eat it if you don't want to. What the heck, you guys? - Come back. - Oh, my God! Let it go. Whatever! I heard you the first time! Okay, okay. We're going on. It's my turn. It's my turn. Okay. Laurie, truth or dare. - Truth. - Coward. Who do you think is the prettiest girl here? Oh, you are lame. Easy. Meg. No question. Now, Brooke, um, what's your thoughts on the matter? Hmm? You know, I only see inner beauty. So... Oh! Okay. All right. That's enough. Look, she's pretty. Inside and out. We all get it. - This is stupid. Let's play Extreme Sardine. - Yeah! I say the last person to find me has to lick every one of our big toes. Oh! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Oh. I see you! Jo? - What do you think you're doing? - I'm so sorry. The... You come in here, you play my favorite piece, and you don't have the decency to finish it? Hmm? Go. I-I'm sorry. As well you should be. And I think that you should come over here three days a week and play whatever you like. Do we have a deal? Well, then I... I think this calls for a little Beethoven, don't you? Chronic myelogenous leukemia. Leukemia? She's young, so there's a lot we can do. - Cancer? - It's a type of cancer. So, okay. What can we do? We want to start with radiation and chemotherapy immediately. It will be very hard on her. She's already quite frail. - But she seems like a fighter. - Do not call her frail! You don't even know her! Josephine. Josephine. Meg, honey, will you go get her please? Go. - I'm really sorry. - It's a lot. Uhh! I'm sorry. It's gonna be okay. What if I get sick too? What if I die before I get to do anything? I've never been in love. I've never had a boyfriend. Never even been kissed. Hey. You're gonna be okay. I promise. You're not gonna die without being kissed. How do you know? I just know. Even if I have to do it myself, I'm gonna make it happen. Fine. Excuse me, sir, you can't go past here without signing in. I'm not a sir, sir. Check your clipboard. Name's Jo March. I'm already signed in. You're tired, honey. I'm sorry. - You're looking better though. - Thanks. - Where have you been? - I was so worried about you. Beth, do not worry about me. I'm fine. I-I'm sorry. I freaked out. I know. I-I felt so helpless, and so I had to do something. So I started on the Internet, didn't know what to do. Horrible idea. WebMD scared the crap out of me. And then I started Googling all these cures and treatments and three hours in, I realized that's not what you need. Beth, I know you're gonna fight this. And I know you're gonna beat it. You have to. So, one thing that I promise... that I'm going to be by your side for every bit of it. So if you have to go on a special diet of spinach juice and tree bark, I will eat it with you. If you have to bathe in essential oils twice a day, I will join that pyramid scheme, and I will get you those oils. If you're gonna lose that gorgeous hair... well, soldier... I'm losing it with you. Wow! That's really bald. God, it feels like the head of an alien. What did you do with your hair? Did you donate it? No, Mom. I sold it to pay for that stupid candy machine. Yeah, they've got a good selection down there. Gosh! Jo! How did you... Why? Your one beauty. Honey, cheer up. She's gonna be all right. I shouldn't be this upset. We all are, honey. Come on, Jo. It's natural. It's okay to be upset. I know she means the world to you. No, it's... I never realized how ugly I am. Oh, honey, your hair will grow back. Not for forever. Trust me, when you look back at this time, you're not gonna care how you looked. Besides. What's the most important is the workings of your mind. Your humor, your kindness. Your courage. Don't tell Bethy, okay? Of course not. She's lucky to have you. - Are you all ready? - Yeah.

I am on the train back home. Don't worry. You beat this once, and you are going to beat it again. Okay? I love you. I'll be there soon. It'll be summer, Beth is in remission. It's perfect timing. We weren't supposed to get married until we're 30, Meg! - You broke the oath! - It was a stupid oath that we made when we were kids. Why do you even want to get married? We don't live in the 1700s. We don't have to rely on men anymore. - Because I love him. - Oh, how do you even know? Look, I just know. And I really need you to support me. Well, I can't. I know you don't understand why I wanna be a mom and get married and have kids, but it's what I want. I don't believe you. It's not your castle. It's mine. Meg, just remember this. One day when you're 40 years old, you're gonna wake up and you're gonna look at your wrinkly face in the mirror, and you're gonna ask yourself, "What did I do with my life, except give up everything for a man?" How dare you belittle my life and my dreams? I have always been there for you with your work and all of your ambitions, no matter how insane they seemed to me. I'm not asking you to change, all I'm asking... Jo! All I'm asking is that you be by my side for one day to support me in the life I have chosen to live, without judgment. You seriously can't give me that? How selfish are you? Dove's right. We're growing up. You have to deal with that. So, I'm just supposed to sit around, let her ruin her life? Well, that's the point. It's her life, it's not yours. She's going to regret this. If you don't go to this wedding, you will regret it. A toast to the college grad! You're a real Stanford man now. Cheers to a piece of paper. - So, what's next? - I don't know. Part of me wants to just chill out and work on my music, but there's so much pressure to go out and get a real job. Grandpa wants me to move to London and learn the exciting world of bond trading. No, that is awesome. You have to do it. But what about my music? Do both. It's London. Come on. You can't pass it up. - Come with me. - Okay. You know I want to, but I can't. Not yet anyway. Why not? You've always said you wanted to get out of here, so do it. I have classes at Lowell. I-I cannot be that far from Beth. What if we both go to New York instead? - You hate New York. - So what? It's closer to the family. Then we could be together. No. No. You need to go to Europe. - Do not change your plans for me. - But I want to be with you. I will come visit you whenever I can. Jo, listen to me. I want to be with you. What? I love you, Jo March. Whoa! Wha... Okay, okay. Don't be stubborn because I know you love me too. - I do, but... - But what? - You're like my brother. - But I'm not. - But I don't love you like that. - Yes, you do. Jo, I'm your favorite person in this whole world. Yeah, you-you are, but it's... it's... No, what we have is... It is not that kind of love. - It's... - Because you won't... It's not you, Laurie. It's just I don't know if that's what I want, Laurie. - Yes, you do. - With anyone ever! - No, I don't! - Yes, you will! One day you will! You're gonna find someone... that's gonna make it impossible for you to say no. It's just not gonna be me. Laurie, it's... Laurie! Laurie! Hey, Freddy, it's Jo. I had some family stuff come up, so I'm gonna be going home for a while. Hopefully, I'll see you after the holidays. It seems like we're missing something. That's not it. - No, the other one. - Which one? Yeah. Wow. It looks so great. - I think we're good, right? - No. No, not yet, honey. Could you find a home for this? Jo! Hi! Are you kidding me? And it's twins. So... - Why didn't you tell me? - I wanted to surprise you. Oh, please! You wanted to see my reaction. Oh. It was entertaining. - Oh, Marmee. - Welcome home, Jo! Welcome home, baby. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Where is she? - What you been up to? - You know me. Out every night, hittin' the club. I've missed you. I mean, I don't miss waking up at 3:00 a.m. every morning to: "Beth. Beth, do you think Lithgo is a good pirate name?" It's not. I'm sorry I haven't visited in a while. That's okay. You're out making your mark in New York City. So proud of you. Waking up every morning in a city full of... I hate it. - I thought you loved it. - No. Well, it's New York. Everybody says they love it. You have to, but nobody really does. I thought I would feel inspired, but instead of bringing out my creativity, - it brings out my anger issues. - Uh-oh. Sometimes when I'm walking up the subway steps, and people are shoving and on their phones, I just want to grab them by the shoulders and scream, "Do you know there is a big, spacious green world out there?" You don't though, right? One time, to a really nice Chinese man named Han. And, apparently, everybody's dream is to be a writer. Except Han. He's a fishmonger, and he's doing great. I just... don't think I can compete. You're the best writer I know. Well, no offense, but you don't get out much. Still think there's some pretty juicy secrets in here. Don't even think about it. I'm pretty sure we've outgrown the club rules. - Maybe you old hags have. - Amy! You made it! Ooh. You seriously look like this after an international flight? It was the longest flight of my life. - Amy. - Beth! - I missed you. - I missed you more. Mm! Whoa! We do not fit on this like we used to. Amy, I want to hear all about Oxford. One semester left, and already two different galleries wanna buy my Haslemere landscape series. What about the "Watching Deer Triptych"? - Oh, that's my favorite! - The what? So, last week, I met with the Lisson Gallery, - and they seem interested. - That's so exciting! Wait, what? The what gallery? Why do I not know what you're talking about? If you answered your phone, you would know. Wait. Who dug this out? Oh... I always want to read through it when I'm here alone. Oh, my gosh. What? Okay.

What happened to your seniors cruise? Well, I don't know. I suppose the Danube has lost its luster in my old age. Aunt March, I think that you're the only person in the history of time that's ever gotten bored with Europe. - Besides Marco Polo. - And Christopher Columbus. - Countless immigrants also. - Mm-hmm. - The Vikings. - The Beatles. - One Direction. - Tons of people, really. Yeah, I get it. Okay, got it. Ha ha! Josephine, this is for you. You shouldn't have. What? I didn't. I found it on your doorstep. - Oh. - Nearly tripped over it when I went to pick up your mail. Can't say "Grandpa." Somethin' else. Pappy, pappy. Poppy, Pop-pop. Look at that. Who's it from? Ooh. Who's Freddy? Are you 12? What does the note say? It said, "When life is rough..." That's all I got to before she slammed it shut. All right, take it easy. She's not gonna tell you. You little cheat! She'll tell me. Right? - Yeah. - Don't even try it. - I'm not telling you. - Come on. - No. - Jo, you always... - I'm not telling anyone! - You always tell your dad. It's literally nothing. There's nothing to tell! - It's seriously nothing. - Leave her alone. It's probably from that professor she's been seeing. - Oh. - What? - Professor? - How old is this professor? No, no, no, no. We are not seeing each other. He is a professor at Columbia who is interested in my writing. That's is all. Jo, that's so exciting. Is he also interested in you? No. It's strictly professional. - Then why would he send you a package on Christmas Eve? - That's a good point. Because it's Christmas, and you give people presents on Christmas. He sent me a Christmas present! Why is that so hard to understand? Is that okay with everybody? That's very okay. That is totally fine. Come on. No, I don't think so. You're children. All of you. Especially Dad. All of you! No. That's great that he likes your writing. He's a very smart man. I wouldn't say that he likes it. Every time I send him a draft, he sends me pages and pages and pages of notes. But I guess no matter how many drafts I send, he still reads them, so... Well, then he definitely has a crush on you. All right. All right, I'm done. Out! Hey, Jo. You get back in that seat. - Move, move! - Sit down. We're just teasing you. We're just interested in your life. Then stop trying to freak me out. All right, Joe. Maybe you're just overthinking this a bit. Not every guy has alterior motives. "Ulterior." "Ul" with a "U." It... - You know what I meant. - If you're gonna make a point, use the right word. Laurie always read your stuff. He was always just a friend. Yeah. Maybe he's just a normal guy who just so happens to be into mythopoeic fables. - Yeah. - You know? Yes. A toast. To Jo's novel, and its inevitable success. - Cheers. - Cheers to Jo. Cheers. And to Freddy. May his intentions be pure and his heart not be broken. I am not cheersing to that. No! I am not... I am not cheersing to that! I am not cheersing! Stop! I'm not! No! Cheers. That was a good one, Marmee. Amy, are you okay? Yeah. I'm such a klutz. - Oh, my... You're bleeding. - I know. Jo! Come back! Please just talk to me! Let me explain. He's been in London. So, of course we've been seeing a lot of each other. At first, it was just as friends, but then at some point, it changed. So, what? You're dating now? I know this must be so weird for you. At first it was weird for me too... but please don't be mad at me. Do you love him? I think I always have. And how does he feel? The same. At least that's what he tells me. Then, I'm happy for you.

Jo, I'm sorry. I'm sorry for how we left things. Me too. I was not ready to hear the truth. But you were right. You ready for some more truth? Let me guess. It was childish, cliché... and my family is... weird and boring. The beginning was slow. Your structure needs work, and you have a tendency for run-on sentences. But it's beautiful and authentic. And I loved it. You did? I might have even cried. Twice. I think this is the one. Come back to New York with me. I can help you get this book out. Beth wouldn't want you to stay here and let your talents go to waste. Come back with me. That was supposed to be my part. Get used to it. Hey, munchkins. What have you got? Show me. Oh, it's so pretty. Is this for Aunt Jo? Thank you so much. I cannot believe I'm breaking my own oath. You didn't break the important ones. I hate doing this without her. She's here. I propose an oath. An oath to surpass all other oaths. To always... always... try and be as good... and sweet and strong... as our Beth. Always and forever. Always and forever.
