Have a seat. We'll be right back. Sorry about the wait. Chief Anna Kimble, sitting in with Agent Michael Thomas. Can you state your name for the record? So, what do you want to talk about? You. How are you doing? Fine. Thanks for asking. How's the club business holding up? Good enough. You like managing the club? Yeah. It's decent work. The hours are long, but the pay's good, so what are you going to do? Well, it's not the most reputable clientele. As long as they pay for their drinks and don't touch the girls, I don't care who they are. So... Tell me about Melvin Anderson. I don't know a Melvin Anderson. Sure you do. You just like to call him Baby Bear. His name is Melvin? It's strange. You're just the manager of the club? What's so strange about that? Well... Mr. Anderson owns a number of establishments and yet, you are the only employee that he seems to spend any time with. We're friends. Nothing wrong with that. Sure. It's the importing of drugs that we have a problem with. Drugs? Obviously, you want to protect Mr. Anderson. We understand that. But the way we see it, you're involved. And you can either help us... ...or you can go down with him. Since I don't know anything, there's nothing to help you with. Is that all? Because I gotta go. Fine. Let's start with this, then. Katherine Hayes. Steven Shavid. So, again, state your name for the record. - Jesus. - For the record. Brian Gibson. Just like yesterday. Then let's go through it again. Just like yesterday. Brian, we already know everything. You're not doing yourself any favours. Why are you even trying to cover this up? Don't you have any self-preservation? Self-preservation? Fuck you. My whole life has been about self-preservation. Again, Brian, we already know everything. Or do Katie and Steven mean nothing to you? Is Bear the only one you care about? You know everything? You don't know shit. Katie... When I had nothing, she was there for me. She... And Steven... Steven was my best fucking friend. Growing up, we shared everything. I had shit all. I didn't even have gloves for the winter. But Steven... He'd give me his pair. And then, he'd tell his parents he lost his and they'd buy him a new pair. He did that with everything. It was nothing to him. To them. I didn't have shit, you know? My dad didn't even stick around long enough for... My mom. My mom worked three jobs. And even they didn't pay for more than a one-bedroom apartment. I met Katie at some bullshit after-school care program in grade school. And... She was the best thing there. Then my mom got sick. Cancer. But you fucking know that already, don't you? You know everything. Katie got sent off to juvie. And some shit with her stepfather. Mom couldn't work anymore. She was dying. She didn't tell me anything. I didn't... And Steven's parents sent him off somewhere for school, so I did what I had to do. I found my own fucking family. Mr. Anderson, Bear... He took me in when no one else was around. He gave me a fucking job. A purpose. And if it was illegal shit, so what? I survived. I did what I had to do. I did what I had to do, man. To survive. To protect myself. OK, Brian. Then tell us. What did you have to do... ...to survive? It was supposed to be one last run. Last fucking trip, and then I was going to move up and move out, and get my life back. I wanted it to be big, you know? And ending and a beginning. Katie and Steven... I invited them along. My girlfriend and my best friend. So that they could see me succeed. So that they could see me be someone. It was nice, you know. To be there with them, hanging out. I had done drops before. They're so fucking easy! Pull over. Throw this shit out. One second. What the fuck? What are you doing with a gun? For protection. For protection? Are you an idiot? Get rid of it before someone gets killed! Brian, what... Say it again! Come on, motherfucker! Say it again. That's what I thought. Oh my God! You should've seen your fucking face! Man, it was priceless. You're suck a fucking idiot! Someone could get killed with you goofing around like that! Relax. I'm just messing with you. Wow. As good as ever. I do not know what Joe puts in that meatloaf, but it is addictive. Yeah, your dad used to say that too. I know. You know, he used to bring me here every Friday night, after I visited him at the department. Yeah, I remember. I miss him. Indeed. Good evening. Hi! You can just sit wherever you'd like. I'll be right with you. So, what can I get for you to start? Three coffees, please. You got it. Thank you. What are you guys thinking? Maybe breakfast? Yeah? So, what can I get for you? Can we maybe have a few more minutes? Of course, darling. Let me know when you're ready. Thank you. I think I want... Excuse me. Yeah! Can we have the bill, please? Sure. Anything else for you? No, thank you. If you don't need change, you can just leave it right there. Great. Thank you. Thank you. Have a good night. Thank you, everybody. Sure thing. Oh! Fifty on a twenty-seven-dollar bill. Generous! Speaking of bills, what do I owe you? I should get back out. I'll just put it on your tab. Thank you, Janice. I will see you tomorrow. You will. You know, Anna... You really ought to learn how to cook. You would miss me too much. I would, but at this rate, poor Joe is going to have to make a whole new menu. Just tell him to keep that meatloaf on there. Good night. Good night! Not yet! I need a bath! Do you want to go to the store? I forgot the phone card. Do you want to come? Is there anything open around here? I think I saw something open on the corner. Why are you carrying that thing around? For protection. From what? In my line of work, anything can happen. I need to be prepared. Brian, all you do is deliver stuff. You think I'm going to do that the rest of my life? I sure hope not. Just give me a minute. Yes? We're going to the store. Do you want anything? Um... Coke and Doritos. All right. Later. Hey, Brian. Did you call? No, not yet. That's the first thing you're supposed to do. Yeah. Whatever. I'll just call when I get back. Hi! How are you? Hi. OK. Wanted a Coke. Diet Coke? Yeah! You want anything else? I'm good. All right. Man, you don't look so good. Will... ...that be all? Yeah. That will be all. Breathe, buddy. Breathe. We got plenty of money. We're not going to rob you. Have a... ...a nice... Good night. Wow, that guy was weird! Some people are! Oh, shit. I forgot the card. Hold this. I'll be right back. Fucking sucks! Let me see it! We've got to get the fuck out of here. Can we stop the bleeding first? We have to get out of here. We gotta stop the bleeding. Steven! Steven! Open the fucking door! What... the fuck? We're leaving. Quinn? What do we got? We got two dead. There's money on the ground and there's a gun by one of the bodies. Ah, Christ. That's Billie Hadden, Henry's girl. This doesn't seem right. I'm thinking it's a robbery. She's right by the gun... And the money... I mean, she just got out of rehab. Probably needed the cash for drugs. It's a possibility. But take a look at the evidence. What do you mean? Well, why did Billie shoot Sam or herself? She clearly got what she wanted. And two dead bodies over there... How did there get to be blood on the door? These blood drops here? Someone else was here? The question is, did they come in with Billie or did they surprise her? That makes sense. But why did the other person have a gun? I mean, unless Sam was so unlucky he was about to get robbed twice. Do me a favour. Make sure we get samples of all of the blood. All right. Let me see. Sorry, baby. Let me take your shirt off. Jesus, Brian! That doesn't look good! What are we going to do? Because if anyone saw you, we gotta go to the police now! Did anyone see you? How the fuck am I supposed to know? You're the gangster wannabe with your fucking gun! It wasn't my fault! You said there were two people dead and you shot one of them. You shot one of them! You're in deep shit and if you do nothing, you're going to drag me down with you. You're giving me a fucking headache. You'll have a lot more than that! Either shut up or get out. Don't tell me what to do! Guys, we gotta go to the police. What if somebody saw you? We gotta go to the police before they do and explain the situation. No police, Steven. Shit! I can't handle this! It looks like it went all the way through. It's pretty much stopped bleeding. If I get it cleaned and wrapped, you should be fine. First aid kit's in the car, babe. Jesus, Brian. I don't even know you anymore. People change, Steven. I'm trying to deal with a situation and you're really not helping. Brian! You killed somebody. If you didn't bring that gun, none of this would have happened! If I didn't have the gun, I'd be dead. Have you thought about what Bear's going to do when he finds out about this? He's not going to. You can't be that stupid, man. Bear is going to find out about this and have us killed. He's not going to think twice about it. Fuck off, Steven. Fuck off. Let's just get through tonight, OK? We can figure it all out tomorrow. Shit. He's really freaked out. OK. Can you... You gotta call Bear now. Shit. I forgot. Sorry, man. In and out, as planned. Good night. So, Steven was freaking out. He didn't have much of a stomach, did he? Go on. Then what? Brian. Come here. I love you. I love you too. I'm sorry about tonight. I don't know if anybody heard or saw. There wasn't anybody there, baby. Are you going to be OK? Yeah. Fine. I'll be fine. Are you all right? Yeah. I'll call Bear tomorrow. He'll know what to do. He'll know if anyone's looking for us. I don't want to know, OK? I just meant that he'll know what to do. I have to tell him. There's another thing. He can't know you were here. What? He can't know you're here. Great. Thank you. Bear? I have a problem, man. This is serious. I had a mix-up. I think I shot someone at a store. You gotta believe me, man. It was an accident. I don't think so. No one saw. No, but... I told him. He's freaking out. He says he wants to maybe go to the police. In another room. Bear. Bear. Good morning, Chief. I got your coffee for you. Thank you, Janice. Oh. You look the worse for wear. I heard about what happened at the liquor store last night. Poor Sam. Such a good man. Hmm. You know, he is one of the people who talked me into running for chief after my father passed. You don't say! I mean, the whole town wanted you to. Your dad's been grooming you since you were knee-high. There's never been anything else I wanted to do. Except maybe last night, when I was sitting at the liquor store. Or this morning, talking to Billie's aunt. Bless her heart. You know, you're going to figure out what happened. That'll ease the pain some. That is the hope. You know... Those three kids that came in last night... They were driving a blue SUV. And? OK. I wouldn't have thought much of it, except those other two, the big spender. They were driving the exact same make and model. You don't say. Two of the exact same blue SUVs sitting in a parking lot. That makes you look. Right. Thank you, Janice, for the coffee. Sure thing, Chief. Be safe. And this one, it's on me. Thank you. I need you to do this. I can't! Please. I'm begging you. Baby, I can't. Then, it's us. Maybe it has to be! Sometimes, we have to do things that aren't right. You're talking about murder! We don't have a choice. You don't. I do! Better make the right one. Think what you're asking me to do. I'm... ...asking you to help me protect us. Us? Please. I want to be together. Forever. OK? This is the only way that's going to happen. Then why don't you do it? I have to drive. Why can't I drive? Look. I need him in the front seat. I've already explained this. Yeah. It's Steven. So what are we going to do? Don't start. What the hell do you mean? What are we going to do? Nothing. We have a delivery to make, and it's going to be made. Brian, you killed somebody. I thought maybe you would've talked some sense into him. Ready to go? The police will be looking for us. The police don't know what they're looking for. The officer at the restaurant saw us last night. We don't look like we're from around here. She left before we did, so she knows what our fucking truck looks like! Then stay here. Please, let's just go to the police! You said it was an accident! Can you make yourself useful and talk to him? So what's this? The silent treatment? Steven, are you coming or not? Brian, I've known you all my life. Fucking listen to me! I have a delivery to make. Do you fucking understand? I'm going to the police. Steven... You'd do that? We have no choice. If you want out of this, then stay here. End of story. Fuck you, man. Useless! Morning. Morning, officer. You two sleep all right? Very well, thank you. How long have you two been in town? The one night. We're just passing through. Where are you heading? West. Where, exactly? If you don't mind me asking. The coast. Is there a problem? I don't know. Is there? No, ma'am. We're just... I need to see your licence and registration. You too. Whose vehicle is this? It's a company car. What company? Nivet Corp. We're from out east. So what are you doing all the way out here? We do audits. You always drive? Yeah. Why? We cover the entire country, so... Well, all right. Here are your things. Thank you, ma'am. Safe travels. You too. Say, by the way... The restaurant, last night... Do you two remember those two fellas who came in with that girl? Uh, no, we don't. Sorry. Why? Never mind. Have a good day. Better make a call. Already dialing. See? Even your girlfriend has a problem with this. You know what? You do what you need to do and I'll do what I need to do. What? Is that a fucking threat? What the fuck are you doing? Hey. It's OK, Katie. I'll meet you 30 miles up the road. Get yourself together, babe. OK. Katie, come on! Please. I need you. Remember: 30 miles east. Yes, that week is all booked off. I booked it off like a month ago. Yeah, that should be fine. And the weather's going to be super nice, so... Ha! Um... Yeah, I gotta go. OK. Bye. May I help you? Can I rent a car, please? Mine broke down a ways back. I had to hitch a ride here. No problem. I just need a credit card and a driver's licence. Oh! - Are you OK? - Yeah! Yeah. I am fine! Hi, babe. Hey. Don't touch me, please. I can't. I just need this to be over. Fine. Any problems? No. See? Please, let's just... All right. Let's go. Babe? You remember how you always say you love me? Katie, I do love you. How... Would you... Could you ever kill me? Are you serious? You know... You know I could never do that. Steven was your best friend, but you made that decision easily. It wasn't easy. That wasn't... I just mean... You didn't even look at the other options. There were no other options. We didn't have a choice. What a mess. Hi! Hi! Chief Anna Kimble. Oh! Jeremy Miller. You got here quick. I did. I hate unsolved murders. Well, I got your email about a blue SUV. Then a little while ago, I got a call about a blue SUV at the bottom of a cliff. I figured it was a little too close of a coincidence. Decided to give you a ring. It's... It's not in great shape. We can't really get down there. The cliff side here is all unstable. I don't know... I don't see any skid marks. The driver probably just fell asleep and... I suppose. Mind if I take a look around? No, be my guest. Unless anything changes, I'm treating this like an accident. It's just your email that gave us a little tip off. I appreciate the call. Have you seen this? It's like a second set of tire tracks. And then we've got these footprints that seem to go between the two vehicles. No, I didn't. I just got here myself. Two hikers called it in. They made sure to call you and then they sent me up here to check it out. These depressions... Deeper here and here. Looks like the SUV sat here awhile before it went off. I guess that means it's not going to be a simple accident. I guess not. You want to call it in? Sure. I guess the question is, where did they get the other car? And where is it now? You know the rental place has all my information? Don't worry about it. It's easy for you to say. Katie, come on. You're right. I just wish I could wake up and have this all be a dream. You know, I... I know. Do you still love me? You know I do, babe. Make me a promise. Katie... You knew who I was when you decided to come with me. And that makes killing someone OK? We didn't have a choice. Maybe we should... Maybe you should stop trying to tell me what to do. I grew up without a mother. I don't need one now. Hi! How are you? Good, thanks. How are you? I'm good. I'm Chief of police Anna Kimble. From over in Hope. Is there anything I can help you with, Chief? I am certainly hoping so. You wouldn't happen to have been working the last couple of nights? Yeah! When don't I work? I know that feeling. Do you get a lot of business around here? You know how it is. Small town. Not a lot going on. A couple of regulars rent cars and trucks to haul stuff, pick up relatives, that sort of thing. Every once in a while, we get a car that breaks down here and there. Sounds like you know this place pretty well. I've lived here my whole life. Then you are exactly the right person for me to talk to. Is this official business? It is, but I can't talk about it. But I was wondering if you noticed anything different the last couple of nights. Maybe somebody came in, didn't seem quite right. Or someone you didn't recognize. There was this girl, a couple of nights ago. Came in late. She was real nervous and jumpy. She dropped her stuff all over the floor. Was she alone? Her car broke down a ways back, so she got a ride here. You wouldn't happen to have seen who dropped her off or what kind of vehicle they were driving? No, I didn't see her until she walked in. Is there any possibility that I can take a look at her paperwork? Sure thing! Let me just pull it up here. Thank you. You know, part of the reason she stood out was because she wanted to pay in cash, and the company charges a big deposit for people under 23. And she didn't have enough cash to... Here it is. I'm just going to go print it for you. That would be wonderful. Thank you. This is perfect. Thank you. Thank you. - Have a good day. - You too. Ha! Hello? How are you doing, Brian? Good. How's everything? Good. You don't sound too good, man. Just tired. I understand. You know I'm here to take care of you, right? I know. You did what you had to do. Family first. That means you too. Right. That was Bear? Yeah. What did he want? He just wanted to see how I was doing. That's all? That's all. You know, it's funny. I can never tell when you're lying. I don't lie to you. What would you say if I just wanted to take the money and run? I'd say you were crazy. Bear would hunt you down and kill you. There's over a million dollars in there. We could go wherever we wanted. There's no way I'm living my life on the run. You're already on the run. Ha! Very funny. It wasn't meant to be. What did Bear really say? I told you. He just wanted to see how I was doing. And that's all? So what's with the sudden change of heart, then? What? You talk about Bear like he's God. And now you say you're willing to steal from him? I don't like it. You know what? Forget it. Come in! Good, you're still here. I'm just finishing up some paperwork. What's up, Quinn? I ran that check on that name for you, Katie Armstrong. Come in, come in. Sit down. I also sent an email to the local departments about her. Did you get anything? It turns out Ms. Armstrong has quite the record. The list includes drug possession, theft and even a few prostitution charges. It's pretty hard to find the files, though, because she was a minor when it all happened. She's been clean for the past few years, though. Interesting. But there was one incident that dates back to when she was 12 that caught my attention. Looks like her stepfather was abusing her. Sexually. So, one evening, she gathered up the guts to stab him with some scissors. He didn't make it. She bounced around foster homes after that. Stories like that... They break my heart. I did contact one of the foster mothers. She wasn't very helpful, but she did mention that Katie was out east now. She reconnected with some old childhood friends. Said something about her dating one of them. Did you get his name? No. She didn't remember. She did say he sounded like bad news. It's good work, Quinn. Keep on it. You got it. Thanks. I'm going to have a bath. Right, then. Do you know that my mother's only 33 years old? She raised me all by herself. We were so fucking poor. I never want to live that way again. Yeah? It fucking sucked. My mom always worked. We never had shit. All I ever wanted to do was try and fix it, make it better. You can't change the past, Brian. What you need to do is figure out a way to fix your future. That's what I'm doing. This is your future? It's not looking so good. You think I wanted all this shit to happen? No, but the shit did happen, so deal with it. I am dealing with it. I did what I needed to do. Imagine living your life knowing that your father never wanted you. Hating your mother for all the fucked up choices she made. Thinking she hates you because she's only 18 years old and she has a 4-year-old son. I won't go back to feeling like that. I'm sure it was horrible. But that should've taught you something. You talk about your father and how he ran out on your mother... You don't know. Just what you've told me. Do you know what it's like to look at every man you see and wonder, could that be my dad? You do remember who you're talking to, right? I was the one who was yanked around from foster home to foster home. We all have a past, baby, but it doesn't mean we let it control our futures. This is my future. Bear has given me a future. That's pretty pathetic. And a minute ago, you wanted to take his money and run. If Bear loves and respects you so much, why does he keep taking your choices away? He's looking after me. My mother never did. He just made you kill your best friend! You don't understand. Not agreeing isn't the same as not understanding, Brian. This is my business! This is my life. And I have to take it very seriously. Those aren't even your words! What difference does it make? That's the problem! And then... I don't know, somehow he found out about Katie. You're doing great, Brian. What happened to Katie? I didn't hurt... I couldn't. Just tell us what happened. Hey. Listen to me, you fucking piece of shit. What did I tell you about goddamn guests? Have you seen the news? You have a half hour to take care of this shit or you've just forfeited your life! Brian, what are you doing? Brian, you're... You're scaring me. Brian! Brian, you're scaring me. Brian! How did you find me? I remembered you from the diner. I just followed the leads, and then contacted Agent Thomas. Chief Kimble is being extremely humble right now. She was top of our class, back at Quantico. If her father hadn't gotten sick and if she hadn't left because of it, she would probably be one of the best field agents in the country. No, things started to go wrong for you the moment you decided to do your drug deal in Hope. Well, at least it didn't go to waste. The thing is, and no offense... You're not who we're after. You gotta know that. Anderson. Bear. That's the goal here. We've been working this case for two years. And he is one piece of work. You do what you gotta do, right? Self-preservation. Look, you have to see that this is your only way out. I do what I gotta do, but... Bear's not going to stand for this. He's fucking ruthless. He's got a son, you know. A real one. Bear. Anderson. He's got a kid. Your point? Nothing. I guess I don't have a point. Brian. I am your best friend right now. You do this and I... We will do everything in our power to help you. It's all the same. Isn't it? Kid loses his family. Who the fuck cares, right? Means to an end? Collateral damage? Just another day on the street. Sins of the... Whatever the fuck, man. You'll do it. Yeah. I know exactly what I need to do. Great. Thank you. Protect what matters. But I need you to do something for me, OK? I'll wear the wire. I'll do that. But after... I need to see them one last time. My mom, Steven, Katie. I need to visit the cemetery before the shit hits the fan. Unaccompanied. And then, you guys get what you get. And I get what I get. Let's get this shit started. End of interview, 3 p.m., August 24. Say it again! I'm so sorry!
