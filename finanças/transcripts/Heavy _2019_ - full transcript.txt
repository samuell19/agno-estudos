What the fuck? Oh, fuck! Baby, come on! Wake up! Maddie, come on, baby. Come on, please. Please, please just wake up. Come on. Come on, baby. Please, baby. Just wake the fuck up. Baby, baby, listen to me. Hey, baby. Come on! Wake the fuck up! Baby! I wish I could say that this story we're about to tell you has a happy ending. But unfortunately, that's not gonna be the case. This is the kind of story where everyone is to blame and no one is spared. Then again, they do say that love conquers all. So maybe even death. All I'm fuckin' saying is, if I were to fuckin' get married, she'd have to be the one. Bro, what the fuck do you mean "the one"? Oh, wait. That's right. 'Cause you're in deep with her father, who's your supplier. And the only way to save your ass is to marry her! Yo, bro, hey, hey! You're always mad corny, bro. Do you wanna hear this shit or not? Okay, go on. You wanna fucking go back and talk about all the fucking redundant bullshit that we always talk about? Sure. What the fuck did I start? Bro, all I'm sayin' is... I do a lot of drugs, right? But I always, always keep it leveled. Bro, I've been meaning to ask you. How the fuck do you do that shit? It's simple, man. I'm tellin' you. You just gotta, you know, like, switch your indulgences around. You know? And then, at the absolute least, you gotta, you know, take a few days off from whatever you got yourself into last, you know? I mean, look, bro. At this moment, I got access to so much shit that I can, you know, stay fucked up, I don't know, seven days a week, 365! 366, bro, if it's a leap year. - Fuck! - And not catch an itch. You feel me? I really need to fuckin' start doin' that. 'Cause I think that I might be addicted to coke, bro. - Like seriously. - Yeah, no fucking shit, bro. You buy, like what, like, fuckin' three ounces off of me each week? How the fuck do you even go through that much shit anyways? Uh, I don't fuckin' know, yo. It's kind of a fuckin' blur. I guess I just... I party too hard. Yeah, yeah, well, try and take it easy, man, all right? I don't wanna be losing my little, best custy here. - I'm touched. - Yeah. Look, bro, all I'm sayin' is... All right, I do a lot of drugs, right? But, I keep it level. And, there's not a lot of chicks out there who can, you know, hang on my shit without becoming "unhinged." And by "unhinged" you mean coked-out fucking drug whores? Yeah, yeah, basically, bro. But you know, she can, man. And throughout the years, you know, we've been through so much fuckin' shit together. Fuck, man. I think I actually fucking love that girl. So how are things going with Seven? Did you resolve any of the issues you were having last week? Uh, no, actually. We had another fight last night. A big one, it was, it was bad. What happened? It's what always happens. Just Sev being Sev. Thanks. Max, arriving just in time, man. Ah, man, I'm so glad to see you, man. What's up? You good? Yeah. I'm gonna give you about, like two for each. I'll put 'em right where they wanna be for the next couple of hours. And then, you know, just give me like two, whatever. - Word? - Yeah. My man. Damn, dude. You hear me? That's right, bro. Aw, fuck, Ellis. - Oh, shit. - You want me? She's a problem, man. - I'm Zhanna. - Sev, pleasure is all mine. Ellis tells me you have molly? Mm, Ellis talks a lot. But, uh, yes, I sure do. It just depends on something. Oh, really? And what does this depend on? Well, it depends on whether or not you're gonna dance with me. Dance with you? - Yep. - For real? Where the fuck do you find these girls, Sev? Maddie, I wasn't... Fucking in a disgusting, pissed covered club bathroom? Are you fuckin' serious? - Maddie, that's... - Shut up, Seven! Shut up! Was she the only one tonight? Huh? Was it just the one? Or were there more of your nasty, fuckin' drug whores? Baby, that's not what was happening. - I fucking hate you, Seven! - No, baby, stop! - I fucking hate you! - Stop, stop! I hate you! I hate you! I hate you! I hate you. Maddie, I fuckin' love you. No, you don't. No, you don't. You can't. You can't when you're constantly doing these things to me. - Always. - Maddie. Why do you always do this to me? Why? Do you know what this feels like? You hurt me. You hurt me so fucking badly. All the time. Why? Why do you do these things to me? - Why? - I don't know. - Why, why, why? - Baby, I don't know. I don't know, all right. I don't know. This is ruining me inside. This is ruining me inside. I don't want to hurt like this anymore! - I know. - I don't want... I can't. I can't take it. I can't. Then why do you stay? Because I fucking love you, Seven. And I can't stop. And I wanna stop so fuckin' badly. You don't even know. - But I can't. - Maddie, Maddie... I can't 'cause you got me. You fucking got me. - And all you do is hurt me. - Maddie. - Don't fuckin' touch me! - Maddie, please. No, I'm fucking serious. Don't fucking touch me. You don't think he's taking advantage of you when he does these things he does? No, no, it's not like that. He doesn't... He doesn't do that stuff to hurt me. He just, he can't, he can't help himself, you know? He hates himself, so he's always trying to do or feel something new. So that he can try and forget about the horrible stuff he feels deep down 'cause of his brother. What happened with his brother? Well, um, there was this accident. - Mm-hm? - A bad one. And his brother got hurt. So, his grandma kicked him out. He's been on his own since he was 16, dealing with all this shit all by himself. I mean, can you imagine having no one? And he thinks it's all his fault, but it's, it's not. It's his fucking dad's fault. That's whose fucking fault it is. His dad is a piece of shit who used to do fucked up stuff to him and like beat on him, and disappear for weeks at a time. And, it was so bad that they had to come and take him and his brother away and send them to his grandma's. And then, fuck! All that shit happened. And then, then he was alone. Now, he has me. And I have him. So we're not alone anymore. And, yeah, I do realize that I sound like a complete fucking psycho right now, but that's, that's all right. Not at all. Yeah, there I was, alone and in pain. I couldn't really do anything about the loneliness, but I sure knew how to stop the pain. Yeah, the heroin. Bingo. Yeah. As you already know, I ended up going a little overboard with it. And trying to kick an H addiction with no one around is pretty up there. Mm. So that's why I'm not leaving Seven. 'Cause without him, who knows where I'd be? I mean it's not like we were like really good friends or anything. He was my fuckin' dealer for fuck's sake. Your dealer? Yeah, my dealer. My, um, my drug dealer. Oh. I mean, here I am, some basically, some fuckin' H whore handing him over the remainder of my student loan. And he decides to save me? Like, what? He gave me back all the money afterwards too, so I wouldn't be in debt. It's just I was so close. I was so fucking close to losing myself, completely. And he pulled me back. Well, it does sound like he was very kind to you. But you're attributing all of your recovery to him. Don't get me wrong. I understand how important it is to have support when you're facing a challenge like that. But don't you think you might've had something to do with it? No. No. Madeline, I think you deserve a lot of credit. You've clearly been through so much. - I mean you... - No, no. You don't get it. He almost died. I had no place to live. My loan wouldn't cover a place and my habit. So what do you think I chose? And when he saw that I didn't have a place to live he let me stay with him. And then, when he realized how bad I was, he tried getting me to stop. And boy, let me tell you, that did not go over well. So he started doing it with me. Like whenever I would slam, he would too. So if I wanted to fuck myself up, I'd have to fuck him up also. See, I had a pretty sweet tolerance at that point, and he didn't. And it took him fucking OD'ing on me for me to realize, you know, "Wow, this guy actually, really fucking cares about you, Maddie. And he's the only one that does. And he's gonna fucking die if you don't stop." So I did. And we went through withdrawal together, you know? Oh. - I'm sorry. - No, don't be sorry. Don't be sorry. It's perfectly fine, Madeline. Hey, that rhymed. That did too. God, maybe I'm being selfish tryin' to change him, getting mad at him like this. 'Cause that's just who he is. He's never tried to change me. Well, besides the Heavy. And I think we can agree that that was for the best. Madeline, I'm so sorry you've been through all this. I just want to thank you for prying that out of me. I don't know. I feel so much... I guess, lighter, after having said all that. Thank you for sharing your story with me. It's clear to me that he's an extremely important part of your life, and as such, he's a very important part of helping you. Not to get you back, but... In order to get you back into the swing of things, we need to get get you comfortable and secure with him. Fuck, Seven! Seven? Hey! Hey, come here. Seven, come on. Wake up, baby. Come on. Come here. Yeah, it's me. It's me, all right? Okay, I need you to help me out here, okay? Come on. I need to get you in the shower. All right? I know, I know, I know, baby. It's okay. I'm not mad anymore. I'm not mad anymore, but I really need you to help me out. All right? Okay? Okay? Fuck! Come here. Come here. Here, sniff, all right? Sniff. Hey, doll. Hey. Tell me. I'm just... I'm just fucking done with it all, man. All of what? Doing drugs? No, no, no. I love this shit. I'm talkin' about all the other bullshit. Me being a piece of shit to you, Maddie. Seriously, Madeline. I'm done hurting you. I'm fuckin' done. I don't care about any of that shit anymore. Okay? I had a moment today and I realized that I was wrong to expect all that stuff of you. You are who you are. And I need to stop being so fuckin' selfish and trying to change you. I know you love me. That's all that matters. Yeah, well... We're gonna start working differently, all right? So now it's my turn to stop my bullshit. Babe, if it weren't for you, I would've fuckin' checked myself out a long time ago. - I mean after my brother's... - No, don't. He's alive. Okay? I'm sure that he's doin' fine. Bad things happened, and you got dealt a really shitty hand in the beginning, babe. But you stuck it out and you played your way into something desirable. And you're actually really fucking amazing. Yeah. You are. You're fuckin' amazing! Hey! Look at me. I'm serious. I'm serious. If I were you... I'd probably be some kind of... - I don't know. - What? - A demon or something. - No, babe. - I would. - No. You're still a total angel. Besides, you're gonna be a famous actress one day, hm? How'd your audition go, by the way? It was the one with the network, right? Yeah. It went really good I think. You're gonna be on TV in no time. Really, huh? Mm, life is some shit, huh? Mm-hm. You think that we're gonna make it? No, but we'll have fun trying. Truer words, doll. Truer words. - Baby? - Mm? How do you wanna die? There it is! I was wondering when you were going to get all weird on me. Seven, shut up! I'm being serious. Okay. - If you could choose. - Hm? If I could choose I would wanna die painlessly. And beautiful. And I wouldn't wanna know I was dying. I would just want it to happen, you know? Peacefully, just drift away into the darkness. That does sound nice. - Your turn. - My turn? Yeah. Balls deep inside of you. Oh, you're so gross! Fuck. Hey. Where have you been? I'm having some type of night, doll. Oh, my fucking God. Seven, what happened? Huh? What? - What happened? - First, I need drugs, all right? Just roll me a spliff and then I'll tell you all about the gangster flick that I just had the privilege to star in. Baby, baby, baby, your face. Your face. I know. I know. Just roll me a spliff, all right? Okay. Well, the core plot point. I got pistol whipped. - Twice. - Oh, my God! Why, by... What happened? I'm guessing I can't just give you the cliff notes, huh? Uh-uh, no. I want the unrated, extended cut, with director commentary. All right, where do I start? Um, I guess... I guess with the call. So, um, this morning, I get a call from Dave. Wait. Like thee Dave? Yeah, babe, like the only Dave that I know. Yo. Holy shit! What did he say? Well, can I tell you the story? Yeah, sorry. Go on. So, this morning I get a call from Dave saying that he wants to link up, you know, because it's been six fuckin' years. - So, of course I agree... - Wait. Your childhood best friend, that you've been talking about for the past forever, called you up this morning, and you didn't bother waking me up to tell me? Babe, I tried, all right? You were just dead to the world. Wake up. Oh, yeah, 'cause of that shit you gave me last night. Anyways, so, you know, we just met up at this diner. Oh, fuck! Yo, my man! - How the fuck you been, dog? - What's up, man? I don't know. We just caught up for a while, bullshitted and whatnot. Shit. It's been forever, my nigga. Trust, dude, but, yo, what the fuck is up with this get-up, kid? What are you... It's like fuckin' 80 degrees outside. What are you, tryin' to detox or somethin'? It's the first thing, you already gettin' at me, nigga? It's the only thing I had clean at the moment. - All right, you asshole? - Still a fuckin' bum ass, I see. Suck a fuckin' dick, man. Ah, son. What the fuck is good, man? How the fuck did you even get my number, cousin? Cake, nigga. Word on the street is you the mother fuckin' man now. I mean, I mean, I mean, I might be. But you know, I've been tryin' to stay in the cut. Yeah, yeah, yeah, well, not good enough, nigga. Yeah, well, whatever, man. I mean if a fuckin' crackhead like you can find me, then, yeah, fuck, I'm in for it, right? You're goddamn right, boy. Nah, but for real though, D, what's aspiring, dog? - How the fuck you been? - Hungry, nigga, hungry. Yeah, I can see that. You're lookin' a little slender there, pimp. What did you lose some weight? This nigga, man. What the fuck though, man? It's been what? Mother fuckin' six years and shit? Yeah, man. Just about. Fuck, you know, I'm doin' all right though, dude. You know, I can't complain. I got... I got a nice little spot, you know, a fine chick. - So, I ain't mad. - Oh, word? - Yeah. - You got a chick? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Like a real thing? - Yeah, man, like, like the one. - The one? Yeah. I ain't never heard you talk like that, boy. What the fuck happened to you, huh? Remember that "Bitches ain't shit." tip you used to be on? You know, we all gotta grow up sometimes, man. - You told him about me? - Of course Oh, shit. - Sorry, Sev. - Fuck, baby! Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. - Fuck it hurts! - Your poor face. - Yes! - Okay. But keep goin', all right? Wow, babe, I'm glad you're so fucking concerned. - Oh, don't be a pussy. - I am what I eat, baby. Oh, my God, ew. Gimme' that. Anyways, uh... So, he gets all serious on me after we finish eating, asking me if we could go outside to talk. - Yeah, I'm good, brother. - Yo, um... You mind if I holler at you outside real quick? I got somethin' I'm tryin' to run past you for a second. - Yeah. - Oh, all right. Oh, woo! - So, what's happenin', D? - All right, so look. I got a little deal I'm workin' on. - You feel me? - Mm-hm. And I was hopin' that you could help out with supplies. Seein' as you the man and all now. What you lookin' for? That's the thing. It ain't for me. - I'm middin' for this other cat. - And who's that? This Puerto Rican nigga. Just set up shop in Harlem. Serious cat, serious bread. He's gonna put some money in my... D, D, D, let me stop you right there, dog. - Come on. - What? Have you not taken a fuckin' good look at me, dog? I don't fuck with crimey niggas no more, D. My operation is suit and tie, white lab jacket, no burners type shit, dog. It's straight business, man. And I don't need any more of it right now, all right? Yo, you wouldn't even have to deal with this shit, a'ight? You won't have to see the cat. Look, look. I'ma deal with the whole thing, bring you back your cut of the bread when when it's wrapped. Simple and sweet. D, I got rules to this shit, all right? That's what keeps me up. Yo, I'm askin' you a personal favor, my nigga, all right? Like this shit could really help me out, put some bread in my pocket. I'm strugglin' out here right now, my nigga. Fuck, man! How much and of what? A whole one. Of Heavy. All right. I guess I can let you run with a zip. Nah, nah, I ain't talkin' about a zip, my nigga. I'm talkin' about a brick. He wanted you to front him a brick? - Yeah, I know. - Is he fuckin' crazy? That shit's like 110 grand! More like 150, babe. And that's exactly what I told him. 150 fuckin' racks? Who the fuck you sellin' to, the Prince of Persia? Yo, this ain't some street shit, dog, all right? It's pure China. You heard I was "that dude"? This is why, man! Look, it's just not gonna happen. I can't let you roll with that, man. Look, there's absolutely no way in Hell that I'm gonna go meet with some dude that I don't know to talk about a brick. Fuck, man! Get the fuck out of here! Like, please, dog, tell me this isn't the only reason why you hit' me up. No, my nigga, of course not, a'ight? Yeah, that's part of it, but I straight up wanted to see how the fuck you was doin', yo. I just figured, you know, two birds and shit. Two birds. This fuckin' dude right here. I'm outta here, man. Fuck you, man. No, no, no, let me say somethin'. - Let me say somethin'. - What, bro? - What? - Look, my bad, a'ight? A'ight? That shit's dumb. All right, I hit you up, stupid out of nowhere, and asked you to front me a fuckin' brick, a'ight? Look, it's disrespectful, and I apologize for that shit. You know you my nigga over everything, but I am strugglin' right now, my nigga. I just figured you could help me out, a'ight? That's it. All right. Whatever, man. All right, just, look. It just feels like you just fuckin' hittin' me up 'cause you need bread, dog, and that's cool, man. You know I got you, bro, no matter what. You my homie, dog, but like... All right, look. Fuck, man. I'll tell you what. Why don't you just start making my runs for me, all right? It'll be good bread, man. I'll cut you in pretty. You know I won't fuckin' do you wrong, man. Look, I ain't you, Sev, a'ight? You know I'ma fuck that shit up and end up in bracelets, bro. I ain't slick like you, my nigga. Look, how about this, a'ight? You just sit down with this nigga at a spot of your choosin'. Just have a chat with this nigga. - That's all. - Baby, no, you didn't! He was my best friend. I mean, I mean, what am I supposed to tell him? - To go fuck himself? - Yeah! - No, man. - Yeah! - What if he had been a snitch? - Maddie. - Sev, what if he is a snitch? - Maddie, chill! What if he is a snitch? Sev, you can't be fuckin' around with this shit! Chill, all right? What if you get taken away from me? I considered all of that, babe, all right? , I was careful not to do anything stupid that will get me into any shit... - Said your face. - Legal shit. , according my face, none of this has anything to do with the cops, all right? So can you please, babe, just keep your comments and questions for after the fucking story? - Okay. - Thank you. So, I gave him a place and a time, all right? A place and a time that would give any potential cops no kind of time to set any shit up. Rodrigo Dominguez. It's a pleasure to finally make your acquaintance. - I've heard a lot about you. - Well, that's not good. Oh, tranquillo. Not from the streets. From our mutual friend, David, here. - That's hardly better. - No, no, no, I just told him... Yo, D, do you mind if I just get a minute with Mr. Dominguez? Now, at this point, the shit that I took was really startin' to really kick in. So, I'm not gonna lie. I was kind of fucked up. I just started spitting it to this guy like I was the goddamn man. Mr. Dominguez. - Please, call me Rodrigo. - Rodrigo, all right. I don't know you at all. I mean, for as much as I know, you could be a fucking cop. I mean, I gotta say, this whole fuckin' situation is pretty suspect. I haven't seen Dave in, what? Like six fuckin' years. I mean, six years of no contact. No attempts of reaching out. And then, today, out of fucking nowhere, he just happens to pop up and know all about my fucking business, and, in-fucking-sisting that I fucking meet with you. So... Man, I mean, he was pushing with all his might, by the way. I mean, he really, really was pushing for the issue. So I'm gonna have to apologize, man, but you gotta understand my concern here. - Mr. Max. - You can just call me Max. I can assure you that I'm not law enforcement. I can also assure you that I'm a very serious man, here, representing a serious organization, With the sole intent of conducting serious business. Plain and simple, I'm not a cop. Or as our friend, David, so eloquently puts it, "a crimey nigger." Yeah, well, you don't seem the type. But, you know, bear with me here, 'cause I'm gonna have to inquire further. You see, how do I know that you're not gonna slap some bracelets on me the moment that I agree to do whatever the fuck you think that I'm considering doing? Because for some reason, you simply telling me that you're not a cop... And look, hey. I apologize for that because it might seem a little bit strange. But you tellin' me that you're not a cop's not doin' a thing. Mr. Max, if I were law enforcement, I wouldn't be going after you and your ounce-at-a-time operation. I would be going after your supplier, Mr. Bratva. How the fuck do you know about... Information, Mr. Max. That is the most valuable commodity in my line of work. And as such, I take great care obtaining all the information available about a territory before moving in and establishing a network. You see, you happen to have the only good connection to the substance that I need. Which is the only reason why you and me are sitting here having this conversation today. Then why don't you just go to him directly? So you said "No"? Well, yeah, at first. Then you got pistol whipped? Yeah, Maddie, he just pistol whipped me right there in the lobby. No, baby, come on. Of course not, all right? He asked me if he could show me something and I tell him, "You know, I'm not gonna change my mind." And he's like "Ah, but assumptions Mr. Max," and insists that I take a look. So, I'm like, you know, "Whatever." And then, this fucking guy just nods at the bartender, and then out of fucking nowhere, this bellhop arrives, and just shows up, and hands him a bag of fuckin' origins unknown, okay? Now, at this point I'm thinking, like, "How fucking early was this guy?" You know, because as soon as he grabs the bag, he takes me to this, like, back room, which I'm assuming they do, like, you know, private dinners and stuff. And you know how, like, some nice hotels have like, you know, these fucking massive drapes just tied open everywhere? - Yeah. - Well... We walk into the back room and this fucking bellhop just stands there and drops the fucking drapes on us, right? What the fuck? Yeah, I know, I know. And when I'm all done being creeped out by that, like, I fucking turn and there's this bag, Maddie, just being hoisted into my fucking face. - And guess what. - What? - It's fuckin' full of money. - For what? Two bricks. Which, is very doable. But, you know, I was still a bit iffy because I didn't want to be delivering a key to this guy every week. - Right? - Mm-hm, yeah. So I tell him that, and he goes on to tell me that he only needs these two bricks, and that he respects my desire to stay small time, and that he's not expecting a long-term arrangement. That makes no sense. Why? Personally, I don't care about quality. However, when entering a new territory, a pure supply is essential in creating a strong network. You see, by flooding the streets with a superior product, you win over the addicts from your competitors. And then you shut them down. Once they're shut down, it doesn't matter what you sell. You didn't take that money in advance did you? No, no, baby, of course not. I'm not fuckin' retarded, all right? There's absolutely no way in Hell that I'm gonna find myself owing Rodrigo Fucking Question Marks 240 racks. I came here. I grabbed my savings. And, Yuri fronted me the remainder. I knew that if anything happened, Yuri would let me work off the debt, you know? - You came back again? - Baby! I tried every step of the way. But you were just a fucking goner, Goddammit. Fuck! Is that shit even safe? Totally, babe, you're just a lightweight these days. Yeah, for real though. But anyways, moving on. Let's see here. - Business is good I see. - Yeah, yeah. Hey. I got somethin' for you, my man. Seven, you are too good to me. Well, you know how you're always going on about how much you miss your fucking Quaaludes? - Boom. - No! Yep! How did you find them? I know this guy over at Columbia. Had him whip up some methaqualone... Now, I've never had a Quaalude before, but that shit right there is somethin' else, my man. Seven, this is a beautiful gift. Tonight, I will take my girl out and I will fuck her like a rock star! I'm glad you liked it, man. So, tell me. How are things with Madeline? Good, good. She's actually, um, at the apartment taking a few of those. But, hey, let me know how they compare, 'cause they've been touted as "super-ludes." The taste is nostalgic. So, tell me. What brings you over here? More money to clean? No, um, actually, I need more product. - Already? - Yeah, a lot more. - How much? - A brick. - Seven... - Look. I know what you're thinking, all right? But it's a short-term arrangement. I just gotta move two. One now, one later, and that's it. I just wanna fucking feel comfortable in my life, man, with my girl. You know, I'm just fucking tired, Yuri. Of this everyday grind shit. I mean, you gotta understand that, man. And you know me. I'm not in the fucking wholesale biz, all right? I'll be out of the fucking game before they even know I'm on the court. Seven, I hope you know what you are doing. Because competition in this business is not so friendly. I do. I know. Okay. When do you need this for? Uh, in like 30 minutes? Look, I got 60 grand right here and I was hoping that you can front me the remainder. I'm gonna get rid of this one as soon as I get outta here. And I'll bring you the cash tomorrow. You keep this. You should always have some money on your person, in case for emergencies. We are going to call it 100 flat, as long as you bring me some more of these next time you come by. Fuck, you got it, Yuri. Thanks, man. Seven, this is a lot of product. You should have a gun. I can give you a good price. And also, I can send some people with you, if you need it. No, no, man, no. Thanks for the burner, but you know me, bro. I don't do business with those types of people. I got it under control, Yuri. You don't have to fuckin' worry about it, all right? I'll come back for the other one tomorrow. And come this time next week, I'll have a good amount of cleanin' I'll need doin'. All right? You become more of a man every time I see you. Keep it up. Hey, take it easy on those, bro. They're fucking strong. I have been eating these things since before you were in your father's sack, okay? There's a reason they call me "The Machine." I'm just saying, you better have, like, fucking 16 hours in your schedule free. Otherwise, you should fuckin' tell Pavel to bring you a nice little a pillow and a little blanket. Smart ass. Okay, your stuff is going to be ready out front in 10 minutes. Now, get the fuck out of here before I ask Pavel to bring me a gun and a mop. So... Here's where the sky falls down. I get the package from one of Yuri's guys and I'm on my way to do the damn thing... Why did you rush all this shit? I don't know, babe. I just wanted to get this shit over and done with. And, Rodrigo didn't have any objections over the speedy process. So I just figured, you know, "Fuck it. The sooner the better." Yeah, 'cause he's about to fuckin' rob you! Rodrigo didn't rob me, okay? The stuff is right out there, safe and sound on the kitchen counter. - You didn't get robbed? - No, babe. Oh, that's fuckin' great, babe! Wait. So, um... Why did you get pistol whipped then? I'm about to tell you, baby. I get a call from Dave saying that Rodrigo has changed the meeting location from the nice enough hotel that we had agreed upon to some shitty motel in the dead heart of the BX. What the fuck do you mean? No, man! Dave? Why would Dave call you? Oh, that's right. I forgot to tell you. Um... Back at the hotel, Dave had suggested that all communication go through him. - Why? - More money. And to keep a distance between Rodrigo and myself. I don't know, baby. I was fucked up, all right? And it sounded smart. And Rodrigo was fucking giving me anxiety and... I don't know, babe. Fuck! It was Dave and I just fuckin' agreed to it, all right? - It's pretty dumb. - Yeah, I know. It was fucking stupid, but, for the record, Rodrigo didn't care for the idea either. So, I get a call from Dave saying that the meet location is changed, right? So now I'm fucking pissed off, because that's sketchy as fuck. But, you know, I already had the brick on me. So I didn't wanna, you know, have to go back to Yuri and ask him for a refund like an fuckin' asshole. So, you know, I take my time bouncing up to the new meet location. So I finally get to the motel and Dave calls me again. Tells me that everything is Gucci and that they're waiting for me. So, slowly, I make my way to room 202. I knock on the door. I waited a while. And, jackpot. - No! - Yup. Yeah, that's right. Well, come on in, nigga. We been waitin' on yo ass. Shit. So now I'm in the room. We've got three of Rodrigo's guys on the ground duct taped and all that. And one of them is cold knocked out. And here I am stuck chillin' with two of the hoodest boogers you could ever hope to meet. And the best part about it is, they've got these ski masks on, but not the black, you know, "professional" ones. No, the ones with the fuckin' puff balls on top of them. And they've got one of them sitting on the bed going through the money, my fuckin' money, like a fuckin' degenerate. And the other one is shoving a pistol with a fucking rotten potato on the barrel in my face asking me where the work is. I didn't even know potatoes went bad like that. I don't got it. What the fuck you mean you don't got it? I mean I don't fuckin' got it. Hey, yo, don't make me start squeezin' up in this bitch, man! Let him have it. They're dead men walking. Hey, Papi, you open yo mouth again yo fam's gonna' get some bad news, real fuckin' soon! You feel me? Fuckin' right. Now, where's that fuckin' work? I ain't fucking playin' with you, man. Chicos got the loot. Gringo has got the work. Loot's right fuckin' there! So where the fuck's the work, man? Shit! Yo, can you not hear me or are you just fuckin' retarded? - I said I don't fuckin'... - Get the fuck outta here. Sit yo ass down. Fuck. Mm, let that shit marinate. What, huh? Come here. Look. Shit! Mother fucker, you want another mouth behind your ears, bitch? I ain't gon' ask you again. Where's my work? Why the fuck do you think that I was late, huh? Hm? I dropped that shit off and I came here to set a new meet, mother fucker, all right? I don't do last minute changes, you stupid fuck! You really thought that I was gonna bring a key to the fuckin' projects? You fuckin' moron! You want that fucking work, bitch? Then go get it from Yuri Bratva, all right? Because that's who's holding it for me. Now, make sure that you bring all your fuckin' monkeys with you if you to go to war against the Russians, all right? Because I don't think that a bitch ass mother fucker like you is gonna get anything from him. - Fuck you! - Shit! - Mother fucker. - Yo, T! Fuck the work, my nigga. It's 170 racks! We hood rich. Let's put the mariachi band to sleep and cut. Yeah, yeah, yeah. A'ight, fuck it then. We out. It's time for y'all niggas to go night night. And then I passed out. What the fuck is wrong with you? - Maddie, Maddie, Maddie! - Why would you antagonize them? You could've got killed! You fucking idiot! Hey stop! Hey, stop, all right? Fuck! I'm sorry! Fuck! I was just pissed about Dave, all right? Dave, he's my fucking brother. It hurt, all right? Bad. For fuck's sakes! It was for sure Dave? When I came to, all of Rodrigo's guys were still there. Minus the money, so yeah, I'm pretty fuckin' sure. What happened when you woke up? More like got woken up. Ah, fuck me. Okay. Yo, amigo. It appears your old friend is quite a snake. Yeah, it looks that way. Hey, Mr. Dominguez, I hope you don't think that I... If I did, you would already be most informed. Cool. It seems in our haste to do business together, we both did some very avoidable mistakes. Embarrassingly, I more so than you. Yeah, that sucks. You don't have any GPS or nothing on the bag? You're a sharp boy, Mr. Max. It's unfortunate, but I was so busy examining you, I overlooked the most concerning piece on the board. Hm. Yeah, I hope when all of this settles we can move ahead as planned. Yeah, I can't even move this if I wanted to. From here on, we will be communicating directly. Now, if you would be so kind as to hand over the phone to one of the two gentlemen in front of you, that don't look like they're on the verge of shitting themselves, that would be most appreciated. - Yeah. - Oh, and Mr. Max? - Yeah? - We will find them. And they will be dealt with. Harshly. So, yeah, babe. My best... My second best friend set me up. And Rodrigo is the scariest mother fucker I've ever met in my life. I think he killed the guy at the motel for just getting scared. Which... It's beautiful. And now, my face has been on fire for the past two and a half hours. Holy fucking shit. I can't believe I didn't see that shit coming! I'm such a fucking idiot. Oh, baby, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. Is there anything that I can do for you, hm? - Hm? - Yeah. Yeah? But you're not gonna like it. What? I need to get into some Heavy. I need you to not give me a hard time about it, okay? Again? Yeah, babe. Sev, you really can't be fuckin' around with this shit. You almost went too far last time. I know. I know, Maddie. But if there was ever a fucking time, baby. My face is killing me, all right. My nerves are shot. And my mind just won't be fucking quiet. It's not like fucking coherent thoughts, baby. It's like frantic fucking cross chatter, all right? I'm literally minutes away from losing my shit. I'm sorry. It's the only fucking opiate I have here. It's okay. It's okay, fine. It's fine. I'm gonna do it with you. - No, baby, come on! - What? I can't be dealing with this shit tonight. What, it's okay for you to do it to me? But not for me to do it to you? Listen, if you wanna slam yourself out, you're just gonna have to deal with me doin' it too. Maddie, I can't even begin to get into all the fucking reasons why this isn't even remotely similar when I was on that shit for you, okay? Okay, fine, point made. But, it's been, what? Two and half years since I was like that. And, thanks to you, I have my self control back. Besides, look at your fuckin' hands. I'm gonna have to dose you anyways. Whatever, Maddie. Whoa, Maddie. What the fuck? Not so much, baby. You ready? Yeah. - Okay. - Wait, wait. - Hold still. - Wait. - I done good. - Real good, baby. Real good. Okay, my turn. Bullshit. It's a tiny, little amount. Sayonara, baby. I love you. Are you okay? You stay the Hell away from this family. You're nothing but pure evil, Seven. A curse. You're dead to us. You hear me? Baby, please. Please. Wake up, Maddie. Please, please. Maddie. Maddie, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Look, kid. I know this is a rough time for you right now. But we're gonna have to bring your down to the station and ask you a few questions. All right? You're not under arrest, or anything like that, but, we just need to get a few things straight. Yeah, you hear me? Okay. Fuck! Seven, wake up. Mr. Max? I have something to ask of you. It's very important to me. I'm sorry, but I can't let him live. That's not what I want. Let me do it. I hardly think... Chances are the money's long gone, and even if it isn't, it's likely they've already spent a good bit of it. If you let me do this, whether I find the money or not, the shit is yours. Why? You needn't concern yourself with such unfortunate affairs. What about him? Your friend? I'll know how to find him. You either let me do this, or I will chuck this piece of death into the river. I am not the type of man you would be wise to threaten. It's not a threat. That's just what's gonna happen. Now, make a decision. You have until tomorrow afternoon. And then it's back in my hands and I will still expect the same arrangements. You understand? Forward me the address. What now? They all gotta go. All of 'em. - And then? - I don't know. I haven't thought that far ahead yet. The future seems pretty unimaginable. The past? Unbearable. I've gotta focus on the present here, Yuri. My life is just livable in the now, you know? I do. If you are to do this, you will do it right. You will need more than just a gun. A silencer and a few things to keep them under control. Hey? Pavel! With the silencer? Da. Seven, please, let me just send some people. Nah, it's gotta be me. Then let me send some people with you. I appreciate this more than you'll ever know, Yuri. You're a true fucking friend, man. And I love you for that. Seven, you are like family. Anything for you. I actually need you to, um, find someone for me. - This is... - Yeah. I see. A few hours. Thanks, man. Oh, and, um, one more thing. Da? I don't know if I'm gonna be able to pay for that brick, but, I think I know how to make it square. Fuck. Okay, all right. Man... Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, shit. Okay. Okay. Oh, fuck. Ain't nobody there, man. Yo, I'ma fuck all y'all little niggas up, man! Yo, what the fuck? - Get the gun, son! - Shit! Hey, move to the fucking wall! I can't! You just fuckin' shot me! - You bitch nigga! - Do it now! - Grab the gun, son! - Hey, hey! - Hey, yo, motherfucker... - Get on your fuckin' knees. Do it! And crawl over to your little... - Fuck you, white boy! - Fuck you, what? - Huh, you lost? You lost motherfucker? - Shit! Shut the fuck up! You shakin', white boy. Calm down. What you gon' do? Lala, look at him. He fuckin' scared, son. - Get on your fucking ass. - You fucked up. Get on your fucking ass! What? Huh? You ain't got no fuckin' heart. Fuck, man! Yo, Trey! - Fuck that, man! - No? All right. How 'bout we try another fucking no looker, bitch? - Trey! - Ah, chill, chill! A'ight, tough guy, chill! Oh, man. That was pretty close, huh? All right, tie him up, behind the back. And make sure it's tight or I'll fuckin' take another no looker. All right? I'm sure you two remember me from the whole robbery thing a couple of days ago, right? But, if you don't, I'm the white boy who was supposed to have the work. I'm guessin' you probably know why I'm here. The money. I actually just have a couple questions. You answer them, and maybe I let you go. Cool? Cool. How 'bout we start with you, Cujo? - You fuckin' dead, fuck ass... - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! You want another mouth behind your ears, bitch? Yeah, that's fuckin' right. Now, I'm gonna ask you a fuckin' question, all right? And you're gonna fuckin' answer it. You feel me? Do you know what you fucking took from me? Fuck you! You ain't gotta... Boom! Woo! Oh, my God! You're fucking wrong! Well... Now, that we've established that I do, in fact, have the heart... Let's move on to contestant number two. Hey, hey, hey, hey! Come here. Look at you. Hey, I know how it feels. I really, really do. But, you chose this life. Hm? You chose to hurt and take things from other people. And more often than not, these set of actions set a fucking chain of unintended consequences. You see? That's exactly what I am. Your fucking unintended consequence. Oh, Trey. I'm not gonna ask you again, you piece of shit! My fucking leg, man! And I will give you one more fucking try here, all right? Do you know what you fucking took from me? Everything, man! Everything, all right? You took everything that I had left! All of it! You said it wasn't the fucking money. You said it wasn't the money. Come on, man. No, no, no. What is wrong with you, my nigga? No, no, I guess I can't fuckin' make you understand. It was D, my nigga! You so fuckin' stupid. - D set you up, huh, nigga? - I know. I know. Actually, great segue to my next question. Where is he? I, I, I don't know, man. You gotta believe at this point that I'm not fuckin' playin' around, all right? Now, how the fuck did you get in contact with him afterwards? Yo, we didn't. We set that nigga up. We set him up. Bullshit, man! Fuck! Holy fuck, man! Hold on. So you're tellin' me that D didn't get anything for this shit? I mean, man, you kinda have to appreciate the fuckin' irony here. What exactly was he supposed to get? Give that nigga half a brick. Half the brick? Why the fuck would he want that? Because nigga's a fuckin' fiend. What'd you say? It's the truth, man! As long as we known him, that nigga been a fiend! He'll shoot up any fuckin' thing. Ain't you seen that nigga's arm? Fuck you! Fuck you! How the fuck did he get in contact with you, huh? We used a prepaid. Where is it? You still got it? It's in the fucking room. Hey. Which one? Silver and black one. Okay. First, you're gonna call Dave, all right? And you're gonna tell him that you got his cut, but he's gotta come and get it right now, because you guys are leavin' out of town. There's too much heat. You got me? Okay. Now, be convincing now. This is the performance of your fucking worthless, piece of shit life. - He ain't answerin', man. - Still? No. Okay. Where's the fuckin' money? Huh? Now, before you fuckin' answer, take into consideration that if you say any type of shit like "It's not here." Or, you "spent it all," or any kind of fuckin' bullshit like that, your fuckin' family is gonna be able to save a lot of fuckin' money by having both your fucking funerals at the same fucking time. You got me? Top part of the toilet. Really? Really? That's where you fucking geniuses hid it? On top of the fucking toilet? Will you look at that? Now, remember, you piece of shit, be convincing now. Okay. Yo, my nigga, what's good? Yeah, it's my fault, my fault. We had to lay low for a second. Oh, yeah, nigga, it's just like you said, simple and sweet. But yo, check this, nigga. Like, yo, if you want that work, you gotta come and get it right now. Yeah, right now, my nigga. Yo, the shit's hot around here. A couple niggas might know that we got that bread, you feel me? Yeah, yeah, we goin' upstate for a minute. But, yo, it's up to you, man. We leavin' in 2 hours. If you not here, we leavin' with it. Yeah, all right. A'ight. He's on his way. Wow! Bro! Well fucking done, man! Well fucking done. Oh, my God, bro. Instead of being a piece of shit, you should've taken up a career in the dramatic arts. Bro, that was fuckin' unbelievable. You shoulda been an actor, bro. But I guess your idiocy has spared you a bullet in your face. So... Bravo. All right, I guess you've done your job now. I'm gonna stop fuckin' with you. Now, I'm gonna put this tape back. And I wanna ask you to lay here nice and quiet while I deal with Davey boy. Cool? Cool, buddy. There you go. Lie face down. Come on. A deal's a deal. Now, burn. 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 10, 20. What the fuck did you guys spend 50 grand on in two fuckin' days, man? Fuck. What's up, bro? Yo. Well, come on in. I been waitin' for your fuckin' ass. Bro, I'm so sorry. Bro, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Please... You, man. Nigga... you today, yo. I'm... I forgive you. I forgive you, yo. Fuck, man. Fuck, yo. Yo, I used to be afraid of fuckin' needles, yo. You know how afraid I was of needles, my nigga, yo. And you still put me on and then you fuckin' left, yo! Man, fuck you, man! Fuck you, nigga! Look, fuck, yo. Come on. Look at me. Look at me. This ain't you, bro. Please, nigga, don't do this shit. Oh, fuck, please. Yo, come on, yo. Who am I, yo?

Who's been my best friend through everything, hm? - Seven. - Seven, Seven, yo. That's what the fuck I'm talkin' 'bout, yo. Seven, who are you? Who are you? Who are you, huh? Come on. Look at me. Look at me. - Who am I? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. A demon. - I'm a demon. - No, wait, wait. Wait, no. No, you're not, yo. Wait. Wait, wait, no! Hey, wait! No, no, no! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck, fuck!

Wow! Architecture? Holy fucking shit! My little brother's gonna be a fuckin' architect, huh? I guess so. So... What are you doing here? How did you even find me? I, um...

It's a storage locker registered under your name. Just, you know, use it to pay for school, or to have fun. Whatever you want, man. - Sev, I don't... I don't need... - No, listen, hey!
