(SIREN WAILING) Stop the phonograph player. (TRAFFIC BUSTLING) (CHIMING) (NO AUDIO) Hm? What are you listening to? I'm not listening to anything. Nothing? Right. These are for hearing nothing. So, how much longer is this gonna take, man? Look, I thought I was paying you to soundproof my apartment or something. It's a B-flat. - What is? - Your heating unit. That's a shitty radiator. You do hear the noise though, right? Your problem is your heating unit. When paired with the low tones produced by your kitchen appliances, the note emitted from your radiator is contributing to your... anxiety. - Really? - Mm-hm. (INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) Call this number next Tuesday afternoon if you have any other issues. (UPBEAT MUSIC) (INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) Hello, you've reached the answering machine of Peter Lucian. If I've given you my number, you've dialed it correctly but at the wrong time. Please briefly describe your situation and leave a telephone number. (ANSWERING MACHINE BEEPS) Hey, Peter. This is Brian Mosden, down in Tribeca. Listen.. You know, I was a little skeptical at first uh, but I honestly haven't slept this well in months. Thank you for whatever you did to my blender. (BEEPS) Hi. I got your number from my friend Alex. I'm looking to set up an appointment for.. Well, whatever you did for Alex. He and his girlfriend are getting along great right now. My number is 6-4-6-2-4-0-0-0-8. (RECORDER WHIRRING) The radiator is contributing to your anxiety. You do hear the noise though, right? It's a B-flat. - What is? - Your heating unit.

I'm actually early. - I guess you're Peter? - I am. I'm Ellen. Do you wanna go inside? Actually, I would prefer to ask you some questions outside the apartment first before we enter. Oh. Okay. You wanna have a seat? Uh, it's helpful for me if I record this if you don't mind. Sure, that's fine. This is a lot more formal than I expected. I... I've found that when clients talk about their homes when inside them they, they tend to speak less directly about the issue. Right, it can be difficult to talk about a relationship problem, in this case, your apartment with the, the partner present. Never thought about it that way. So, to begin.. You describe to me your person. My person? Yourself. Oh, like, um, say my name introduce myself, like that kinda thing? As you wish. Um, well, my name is Ellen Chasen. - I am from Ohio. - Mm-hm. But now I live in New York. Perhaps, uh, you could describe your issue to me now. I, um, I am always tired. Exhausted, actually. By the time I get to the office in the morning I'm tired again. And where do you work? Um, I work at a non-profit um, for low-income families. It's in Midtown. - And do you walk to work? - Yeah. I get to help people every day so, watching them they, they get to start their lives over I get to see that. - It's nice. - No, no. I, I asked, "Do you walk to work?" Oh, uh, sorry. Um... no. It would be, like, 40 blocks. (DOOR OPENS) I'll need an extended period of time in each room. Specifically, kitchen, bathroom, bedroom. - Yeah, it's no problem. - Mm-hm. Can I get you some water or anything? Actually, I need it just like this. No additional sounds. - No additional appliances. - Oh. No, thank you. (RECORDER BUZZING) (HUMMING) Kitchen.

We're right around the corner. Hi, yeah, sorry, I... I can't talk 'cause I have, uh, company right now. Do you have a man over there with you? No, that's not why. Yeah. Okay, I'll see you later. Okay. Bye. Sorry. So, at this point, I'll need to go into your bedroom if that's alright with you, Ellen. Yeah? I typically save this visit for last since it is the most personal, but hopefully, you feel a little more comfortable with me by now? Of course. By all means. Can I watch? Mm. Mind if I lie down? Is that typical? You mentioned over the phone that you're having trouble sleeping at night. - Is that right? - Yes. (SIGHS) It helps me if I recreate your morning routine as closely as possible. Would you say you're a side sleeper? - No. - No. (SIGHS) I'll have to review my materials to be certain but I think your problem is in the kitchen. Do you eat bagels every morning? Uh... uh, no. S... sometimes, but usually toast. - Mm-hm. - With some fruit. Okay. I think you need a new toaster. That should do it. I noticed your toaster produces an E-flat. And your refrigerator hums at a clear G. Now, the foundation note is a subtle but convincing C throughout the entire apartment. Here. (MOUTH ORGAN MUSIC) You hear that? Hm? That mechanical sound? Or, uh, perhaps it's... it's wind patterns on the East Side. It's remarkably consistent. Well... anyway a new toaster should solve your problems. You really think it's that simple? Technically, your refrigerator is a perfect fifth. And the minor third created by your toaster combined with the tonic from your neighborhood and, uh, you've got a depression. So, I'll have a new model sent over. Soon. But we should talk in the next few days. Yes, of course. Alright.

Everything in here is really nice. Hm. Maybe I should just move to Brooklyn. - Wanna swap apartments? - Don't yell. - Cleo's still napping. - Sorry. I know, it's nice, it's great. But sometimes it's a little weird living there. Apartment's a little big. And I still get Patrick's mail. I hate that. Anyway, it's cheap. So, why should I leave? Right. Here's to rent-stabilized apartments. - Shit! - Oh, here, let me get you a... - No, it's okay. - Let me get you a... I'll... I'll... I'll grab a towel. There's some towels on the counter there. Okay. (MUSIC CONTINUES) Why is everything unplugged? - Oh. - Yeah. - That's Landon's latest phobia. - Phobia? He's afraid the apartment will catch fire when we're not at home. Or when we're asleep. Or when we're eating dinner. - Or when we're having sex. - Okay. It's not a phobia, it's a safeguard. So, you just leave it all unplugged? Spontaneous electrical fires are way more common than you think, okay? Especially in cities. I read about them all the time. It's his OCD. So, where are you reading about this? The internet. So, how'd it go with that house tuner we set you up with anyway? - And Landon loves that guy. - I love that guy. Yeah, it was, um, it was a little weird. - Weird how? - Why? Is he a creep? No, no, no, no. Not creepy at all. At all. Although, he did lay on my bed. - That sounds creepy. - But not in a creepy way. Not.. He's not a creep. He was actually very polite, and very professional. He told me that, um, I need to get a new toaster. - What? - Why is that so funny? Maybe that... maybe that's helpful. It sounds ridiculous, but he was talking to me about the tonic of my neighborhood and how my refrigerator is contributing to this oppressive chord. - Yeah. - What? Yeah, that's his thing. Right? Here, look. This is from "Talk Of The Town." "According to Peter Lucian, the silence is full of sound "as his practice offers solutions "for depression, anxiety, fatigue "all of which are triggered by the sonic details "of our homes, he explains. "After an impromptu tour of the converted. Cold War-era fallout shelter he calls home.." This guy's so fucking cool. "Lucian points out the meticulous labels "attached to each appliance bearing notes and musical chords." Weird, but kind of sexy. - Is he single? - Are you serious? Only you would find that sexy, by the way. So, what do you think? You gonna give it a whirl? I'm fine. Really. I mean, I think all this therapy is just too much. - It's not for me. - Really? I just need to find a way to get some rest. When Landon was training for his marathon last fall he found a great acupuncture place in Greenpoint. That was for my IT band. Yeah. That's what I'm saying. So, maybe it's worth taking a look at. But that's.. Those are different things. Yeah, but acupuncture. (CREAKING) (OPERATIC SINGING) (SINGING CONTINUES) (WINGS FLUTTERING) (SINGING CONTINUES) (CHIMING) (SINGING CONTINUES) (CREAKING) Do you think it's a problem? I'll see what I can do. Uh, go on. Robert is waiting for you in the study. (INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) My data is supported. Maybe they just can't comprehend it. It's all good feedback, Peter. I encourage my students to ask tough questions in the critique sessions. I think they're maybe caught up a little bit in your.. In your lack of formalities. But I'm close, though. And you understand the significance. Listen, I've read it. Don't rush yourself. This work takes time. Years. Well, it's been years. This is a universal law that I've discovered and the scientific community needs to know about it. You know, there's a trap in science that I talk to my students about. One always sees exactly what one's looking for not because it's there but because one desperately wants to believe that it's there. Are you saying my research is faulty? No! I'm just cautioning you not to make it too personal perhaps even obsessive. One must be obsessive in this field of ours but we have to be careful of too much, um faith... in our own ideas. Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt. Peter, this is Samuel Diaz, my TA. I'm advising him on his thesis. So, are you still thinking of leaving academia? - Formally, yes. - Mm-hm. Uh, I need to get my student loans paid off. Mm-hm. (INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) I thought your research was really fascinating. - Me? - Yes. Thank you. They pick everything apart. Anyone without a Ph.D. gets run through the gauntlet. I could, if you'd like uh, refer you to some standard guidelines for formatting and publishing. Or perhaps Peter could be a person to talk to about that lab position that, uh, you're after. (INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) "Welcome back to "The New American Journal of Sound Radio Hour." I'm your host, Dr. Elizabeth Brookings. On today's show, we're discussing the feature story from our latest issue about new findings concerning the "Windsor Hum." And how does this all relate to the apartment tunings you conduct? Are you familiar with the concept of a macro-scope? You mean a very big microscope? Um, it's a way of seeing things that are larger so, in this case, it's a way of seeing patterns. Once the predominant harmonies are determined.. They're translated here. So, all of this, in a sense, is a macro-scope. Typically.. I know the solution to a client's issues before I even arrive. And it always works? D, F, A. D minor. - That's amazing. - You read music? I took piano lessons when I was a kid. - You did? - Uh-huh. How's your pitch? Sam? How's your pitch? Decent. Uh, my graduate work was on, uh, cochlear neurons in mice. I love the ear. Mm.. (LAUGHS) (WATER SPLATTERING) You've reached the answering machine of Peter Lucian. If I've given you my number, you've dialed it correctly but at the wrong time. Please briefly describe your situation and leave a telephone number. (MACHINE BEEPS) Hey, Peter. Uh, it's Ellen Chasen. I know, I know we didn't have a call scheduled. I'm not sure how this works. I guess, maybe you call me back, or, um, thank you for, for coming over. Uh, God, this, this probably sounds so strange. I don't want you to think that I'm calling you because I'm crazy or lonely, or.. I got the toaster. Um, and I... I'm just wondering if there's anything else I could be doing, you know? And when I can expect the prescription to work, or.. I'll see a change. Okay, thanks. Bye. (INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) Anyway, a new toaster should solve your problems. You really think it's that simple? (TAPE RECORDER WHIRRING) Your refrigerator hums in a clear G. Now, the foundation of.. (TAPE RECORDER WHIRRING) Have you remodeled recently? Put in any major changes? Uh, no, just minor stuff. I mean, no, uh, new coats of paint or, um, redecorating or anything like that if that's what you mean. That's what I mean. How would you describe your place? My place? Yeah, your apartment.

Uh, we're really glad you finally accepted our invitation. Your assistant mentioned potential for financing my research. Of course, of course. The... the recent "New Yorker" article really piqued my interest. So, uh, my assistant pulled materials for our meeting. And it turns out, we've actually used some of your designs. How do you mean? Well, the Echo Decay Timer. I understand, at least I heard it was born in the basement of the Met. Well, I had a position in the Preservation Department. Was maintaining period instruments for musical performances to be historically accurate, and.. I mean, we've significantly upgraded the device in the last decade, but the EDT-1 was.. It was a cornerstone for concert recording. It was never intended for that purpose, so.. Oh. Well, excuse me. I, um.. What was it for, then? I was studying harmonic resonance. And the manufacturer retained my patent in exchange for custom fabrication. But I never wanted it to be marketed for the public. Well, it was a revolutionary product. Tool. "Tool." Of course. I no longer engage with outside fabricators. Well, our clients are Fortune 500 creatures. You're more of a provider for houses, right? Homes. "Bespoke domesticity." That's what friends of mine call it. But really, that's what we're interested in. The market is changing, and we want to cater our products to our customer's private lives. I... I'm offering you an opportunity, Peter. Uh... how is Equilibrium delivered? Well, it's wall colors, fragrances, soundscapes. And our technologies allow our specialists to survey entire homes virtually. Virtually? Well, I mean, it's, uh, currently just a web chat, but, honestly, you know.. The virtual component isn't bulletproof but the clients love it. Our technologies, and our muscle could give you a chance to create an entire atmosphere. Yes, I... imagine the ability to influence like that. I think that I've had a very positive influence on the lives of my clients. (METAL CLANKING) We bought the matching set when we moved in. I thought you lived alone. I do. I... I do, yeah. This is a very long time ago. Mm-hm. Didn't think it mattered. It shouldn't. So, you've been using this every morning? Every morning. (SIGHS) You've got a problem here. What do you mean? Mm, your feelings continue? Yes, my, um, my feelings continue. (SIGHS) Perhaps I should visit your work. Really? To understand what you're doing that might be conflicting with the results. Does anyone have to be there? Well, ideally it would be in the morning. But I could visit in the afternoon then try to replicate a morning scenario. It's just, it's a very unusual thing to have to explain. You know, I... I... I like to keep things at my job kind of... Discreet. I understand. Um, maybe I could come by next week? Okay. (INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) (SIGHS) What does red mean? It's just an anomaly. Does it affect the research? Of course not. Good. Because I already notified "The Journal" to expect your submission. Can I help you with that? No. You know, I was actually thinking that I could process the tapes a lot faster with the university servers. Uh, our computers there are very efficient. Well, everything here works just fine. Yes, but it would help speed up the workflow and save me a lot of time because obviously, I'm still looking for a full-time position elsewhere. Beyond publishing, I... I think there'll be a lot of other applications. You know, once people understand the patterns and, uh, the influences you can do so much with this. - How do you mean? - I don't know. Well, I... I.. Well, I guess, urban design, architecture home products. This is about universal constants not commerce. I... I'm sorry. I just.. (INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) - Stick out your tongue. - My tongue? Really? I can see things on your tongue that can help me. Do you exercise regularly? Sometimes. Okay. You can go to the Blue Room now. Uh, yeah, where should... where should I change? (SITAR MUSIC) (GULPS) How long do I have to keep these in for? The feeling is deep but the needles are not. Okay, but.. Thirty, sometimes sixty minutes.

(FAX MACHINE WHIRRING) (STATIC) Sorry. I'm a little late. My meeting went long. (ELLEN SIGHS) Is everything okay? Honestly, I don't normally work in offices. There's just so much.. (SIGHS) So, I think I got a good sense of this space. Um, well, you know, I.. I actually cleared my afternoon so, maybe we can, uh, go somewhere and... and discuss this further? Yeah, well, I know some place close. (PIANO MUSIC) More hot water, Peter? Ah, yes. Certainly. Thank you, Albert. Yes, thank you. You've really constructed a unique little world for yourself in the city, haven't you? I've lived here for over a decade and I don't know I still feel like there's so much that's unfamiliar to me. Like, someone else built it up. He was very organized about things. The matching nightstands. He always had an idea or an opinion about everything. It was nice, you know? To not have to make choices for myself. It sounds silly, but.. I remember after he was gone.. The remote felt so odd in my hand, like.. I didn't know what any of the buttons were for. Sorry, that's probably way too personal. It's fine. What about you? I'm very consumed with my work. Actually, I'm, I'm publishing a piece on human behavior.. How sound influences the way that people connect with each other. Well, I mean, you obviously have a, a calling. You know, just to see you study and observe, the way that you do. I'm a little envious, honestly. Did you study science? No. Music Theory. So, I learned by dissection how a piece of music works, what are its parts. You know Bach, the composer Bach? His ability to trick our ears into believing that we're hearing multiple instruments from a single violin. Or Stravinsky... and his dissonance designed to alienate an audience or, or Beethoven, this use of suspense and... delayed gratification. But all of these composers were using neurological techniques that scientists hadn't even defined yet. And once I understood that and, um.. How their music functioned um, I guess I just went on from there. To tuning people's apartments? (CHUCKLES) Yes. Yes, but no. I.. It's, um.. It's the influence of sound. The power it has over people's lives.. Hm... they may not even know it, you know. Yeah, it's, um, so complex. - I'm intrigued. - Hm. I have a very, very close friend who's a neuroscientist at Columbia. And his students are reviewing my findings next week in a group session. It's very informal. And if you're interested in learning more, um.. I don't know. (WHIRRING) (TRAIN CHUGGING) (TUNING FORKS CHIMING) (INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) (RECORDER WHIRRING) Battery Park City, F major.

(INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) (BUZZING) (STATIC) Hello, you've reached the answering machine of Peter Lucian. If I've given you my.. Hello? Can I help you? No, he's not in right now. But I can take a message. Sensory Holdings, you said? Uh, I... I'm Sam. Yes, I work with him. (TRAFFIC BUSTLING) Are you Peter's colleague? - Ellen. - Hi. - Hi. - Upper East Side. C scale, with an E flat toaster problem. Oh. I'd like to think I have better qualities than that to describe me. So, did Peter tune your apartment? We're working on it. You mean it didn't work? Well, Ellen's entire soundscape points to a specific trigger in her apartment. Um, but... there is, there is distraction. So, I've had trouble locating the specific trigger. Well, that's interesting. You make it sound so complicated. - It is complicated. - No, no. I think what your friend is saying, Peter is that you make it sound too complicated. But, however, knowing Peter, I'm sure he could show you a diagram on the whole G major theory. - That's right. - It's a pleasure to meet you. - And you're welcome here. Yeah. - Thank you so much. He told me you two were old friends. She was, um, just interested in seeing the group. - Oh. - And my discovery. Oh, well, it'll be good to have an outside perspective on this. - Mm-hm. - Listen. Unfortunately, we had to postpone your review until the next session. Um... I'm sorry. (GLASS CLINKING) In preparation of Andrew's thesis defense we're gonna be workshopping.. Alright, this is me. Wish me luck. - Should we, um.. - Yeah. Before I forget, there's something I wanted to give you. Oh. It will help. It's something I've been working on. So you just plug it into an available outlet. It emits a wash. Uh, preferably one that doesn't share a circuit with a microwave or a hair dryer. Okay. - You want me to hold it? - No, it's fine. I'll just stick it in my purse. So, I'm excited to hear more about this G major theory. Hm. And additional analysis suggests that uh, incorrect analysis of interactions are even more common. Your honors from Columbia are very impressive. Thank you. And your work with Peter Lucian did you accompany him on his house calls? No. But we've been working especially hard on consolidating his data on the city as a whole. Samuel Diaz. It's a pleasure to meet you in person. - I'm Harold. - Very nice to meet you, Harold. Uh, you know, we're big admirers of Peter here. We were actually just discussing the new work he and Sam are doing. - Oh? - Uh.. - Well, it's Peter's discovery. - Mm-hm. Uh, I assume he discussed the urban sound patterns with you? Um, have there been any updates? Well, uh, yes, actually. It's... it's, it's very, very exciting. (SWITCH CLICKS) (INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) My biggest client project to date. So, these beams... reach true ground. What's true ground? Oh, it means they reach all the way down to the earth. It's a hard thing to come by in New York City but we designed these so they'd make contact with bedrock. And what's the point of that? Well... grounding current is really the only way to achieve true electrical silence. That sounds like a total luxury in this city. Oh, well, the future tenant is an electrophysiologist. And he takes true ground and silence very seriously. - Sounds nice, true silence. - Mm-hm. And so expensive. Well, I guess expense is relative to perceived value... right? Please don't tell me you're gonna make me ground my apartment. No. Look at all that. You see the order? In the city? Well, yeah. I mean, the grid, right? And it... it's flawed at points but there are all these connections. Light going from red to green. Walk, don't walk. Instructions, right? But what I've found.. Is that there's something deeper at work. Um... an invisible system, but powerful, nonetheless sounds, that, in a sense guide people through the city. - Hm. - Yeah? I mean, they're not conscious of it, but it's there. And it's different in all parts of the city. Hm. In the Financial District, it's the key of D minor. And it's frenetic, it's fast-paced.. Reckless. And then, Lower East Side is A flat once you get, um... below the dissonance. (TUNING FORK CHIMING) And Central Park is predominantly G major. It's where I made my first discovery. It's the sound of nostalgia. It's calm.. Idyllic, lyrical. Field test 14, Central Park, G major. (TUNING FORK CHIMING) (CHIMING CONTINUES) So, each part of the city has a different chord? Well, every part of the city has its own instructive atmosphere. It's impossible to disconnect the sound from the collective state of mind. It a.. It affects the people. You understand? Oh, but I, I don't see the world that way. I mean, it.. That's so rigid. I mean, if I'm Downtown I'm not destined to feel frenetic. I can choose to react to that and feel peaceful. I can choose to protect myself. It's not about seeing anything. It's... it's about acknowledging what already exists. Like gravity, or light. These are just universal laws. - Right... - And listen. These are, these are rules that define our world. Why does it have to be this permanent thing that controls us? Why... do people act the way they do? Why do people feel the way they do? - There's a reason. - Because they're people. They can. They choose to feel. But... but there are rules guiding their behavior that they can't see. There is an order here. Now, it's complex because we live in an old city. And the patterns are so complicated but it's, it's been written and rewritten but it's there. It's been there for years. I... I don't feel like my life is written by anything. I feel like I make choices all the time. Uh-huh. Well, okay. Your apartment, C minor. It's a mundane key. It's... it's the sound of resignation. Okay, well, I don't feel that way. And that resignation causes your restlessness. And there are unseen forces that are governing your choices. What about you? You're the only person who's not affected by any of it? I'm not immune. No one is. Okay, so then, how do you trust yourself? Because I can hear it. Because you can hear it? (SCOFFS) I'm gonna go. Just.. It's late, so.. (MELLOW MUSIC) The program of the Noise Abatement Commission consists of a series of noise measurements to be made in different parts of the city at typical places.. And centers of popular interest. Among these measurements will be made tests of the deafening effect of the noise. I hold the receiver against the microphone instead of against my ear. Now, I increase the intensity of the test tone until you can hear it. (SIREN WAILING) (RATTLING) (RATTLING) How much longer is he gonna be here? I have to get up early for work. I think he's almost done. (CLATTERS) Hey, are you almost done? It's almost midnight. So, um.. (DISTANT RINGING) That ringing.. Baby, come on. Get him out of here. I'm sorry, I just need to take a few more readings and I can handle the rest in my office. I just need one more minute. One more minute. You know what? Don't worry about it, we can figure it out from here. (INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) (BEEPING) (BEEPS) Mr. Jajinsky. Um, I couldn't access your apartment. FOR OUR 4:00 p.m. appointment. Please call me to reschedule at your earliest convenience. (MUSIC CONTINUES) If Sam showed Sensory my work then they have all of it. - He wouldn't do that, Peter. - Oh, fuck! And you can't fault him for taking a formal job. It's a good opportunity. They're my competition. It's theft. I wouldn't paint it so starkly. I mean.. They're marketers. You're a explorer. Look, they can't take credit for my discovery if I publish it first. We put so much emphasis on sound and thus, overlook the value of those moments in between the noise. And let this remind us that silence is not empty but immeasurably full. (APPLAUDING) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (EXHALES) Enjoy your evening. - Dr. Brookings. - Hello. It's Peter Lucian. Hi, nice to meet you. Thank you so much for your talk. It was fascinating. And for your contributions to the field. You know, I've been reading "The New American" for just about as long as you've had the editorship. That's very kind. Um, thank you so much for coming tonight. I'm sorry, but I really must go. Uh, please enjoy your evening. Well, actually, um I recently submitted a piece for "The Journal." I know these things take time but I just thought I would inquire since I'm here. What did you say your name was? Peter Lucian. Um... I made a discovery identifying sound patterns in the city. And your work... was just a huge inspiration for me. I, uh.. I honestly didn't think we'd have a chance to talk. Oh. Thank you. No, I didn't think you were serious, Mr. Lucian. I must say, your methods are, um, most unusual. H... have you seriously been researching these... Sound patterns. Yes. They are principles that steer our behavior. I mean, it's... it's... it's verified. It's based off of multiple field recordings. Oh, I'm sure you believe in this. Listen.. Perhaps you could submit it for peer review. Yes, yes. Uh, I'll tell you what.
