(contemplative piano music) - In sickness and in health, in adversity and prosperity, and to be true and loyal to him so long as you both shall live. - I will. (audience applauding and cheering) (muffled TV reporter speaking) - Hey. - [Susan] Hey. - So how are you feeling? - Like a beached whale. - Aw. - Oh, Jim, I don't know if I can hold out for another six weeks. - This will be over before you know it. Then our lives will be changed forever. (serene orchestral music) (Susan gasping) (dramatic orchestral music) (glass shatters) - Is the O.R. ready? - Yes. - [Jim] Susan! - Mr. Winters, Susan has a very high fever. She and the baby are in danger. - What? - We've given her some Terbutaline to try and stop the contractions for a while, but your son will be here in a matter of hours. - But he's not due for six weeks! - I know. Look, we don't know what to expect, but we'll do our best. - I know you will. Honey, I'll be waiting for you. I'll be right here. Everything's gonna be all right. (dramatic orchestral music) (machinery beeping) - Jim. - I love you. - He's not normal, Jim. His little body is all twisted! And they say he may die. - I know, I know. - (sobs) Maybe it's best he doesn't make it, Jim. - Oh, don't say that. We'll love him as much as we can, as long as we can. - I can't. I can't, Jim, if he's gonna be taken away from me. I just can't. (cries) (dramatic piano music) - I have today directed the Secretary of Defense to increase the size of U.S. forces committed to Desert Shield to ensure that the coalition has an adequate offensive military option should that be necessary to achieve our common goals. - [Anchor] The tension in the Persian Gulf continues to grow. The U.S.S. Kitty Hawk will be leaving for the region within hours, carrying with her 5,000 men, as many as 85 aircraft. Saddam Hussein again today vows that if the U.S. interferes-- (dramatic piano music) - Jim, please don't go. - Honey, I've got to. This is what I'm trained for. I'll be all right. - You promise? - Of course. Son, while I'm gone, you're the man of the family. You take care of your mother. I love you. I love you. - I love you, too. (sobs) (engine roars) (lively rock music) (engine roars) (engine humming) - Hi, honey, how was school? - Susan, hi! - Oh, hi, Eveline, what are you doing here? - I'm just here picking up my neighbor's girl. I didn't know you had a child. - Yes, I do. This is Jeremy. - Hey, honey. Fred tells me that Jim's about to make Lieutenant Commander. - Well we hope so. - Oh, I'm sure he will. Fred says he is a fine officer, and Fred really knows his officers. - I thought I heard you out here. - I'm sorry. I'm always too loud. (laughs) - Here's your artwork, honey. Give it to your mom. - [Jeremy] Mommy. - Thanks, sweetie. We have to go now, bye. (pot clanging) - [Jeremy] Daddy. (dramatic synth and percussion music) Daddy. - Jeremy, would you please stop that? Jeremy, please, I know you miss your daddy! I know you do, and I miss him, too! - Daddy, daddy! - Jeremy, please! - According to General Schwarzkopf, the so-called smart bombs enable the pilots to pinpoint their targets, knocking out weapons facilities and military installations with very few civilian casualties. (Susan gasps) - We should warn you, the following footage could be considered disturbing to some viewers. This footage of the captured American pilot was shown on Iraqi television this morning. The Navy has confirmed the pilot was shot down after taking off from the U.S.S. Kitty Hawk. (lively rock music) (engines roaring) (engines roaring) (engines roaring) (explosion booms) - [Jim] Bingo! (machinery beeping) - That a boy, Sundance. Now, bring it on home. Mama's cooking dinner. - Yes! (hands smack) All right! (engines roaring) (engines roaring) (dramatic piano music) - Tonight, the Kuwaiti flag once again flies above the capital of a free and sovereign nation, and the American flag flies above our embassy. - The war in the Gulf is officially over. Today, Saddam Hussein agreed unconditionally to comply with the U.N. Resolutions. The United Nations will maintain peacekeeping forces in the region, but most of the American soldiers will be returning to the United States within weeks. (Susan sighs) (upbeat piano and percussion music) (people cheering) (engines roaring) (people cheering and applauding) (serene piano music) - It's so good to have you home. - Mm, it's good to be home. - Jim, while you were away, I called my old boss, Richard Evans, and I told him we were gonna be transferring back to San Diego, and he asked me to come back to work for him. - What'd you tell him? - I said I had to check with you and I'd let him know. Jim, I really want to go back to work. (children playing) - What about Jeremy? - Well, I'd only work part-time while Jeremy is in school, and I already talked to Maureen Childers and she said if I was running late, she'd pick Jeremy up for me after school. Jim, we could use the money, and it wouldn't hurt for me to get out a little more. - Okay. Okay. (jet engine roaring) Well, I've got to decide whether to take another tour or go ahead and retire and spend more time with the family. - Jim, you've been a great XO, and you'll make a great commanding officer when you take over for me next year. I'd really like to see you stay. You're one of the good guys. The Navy needs you. - (chuckles) The Navy's been doing fine for over 200 years, sir. I think she'd be all right without me. I'll see you later, skipper. - Doesn't this smell good, Jeremy? - Hi. - Now this smells like something a business lady would wear. What do you think? - Ooh, that's nice. Let me see that. Whoa, I think we need to take out a second mortgage. (laughs) I'm just kidding, honey. If you want it, you buy it. Hey, I see Lieutenant Jackson over there. Will you keep an eye on Jeremy for a minute? - [Susan] Sure. - [Jim] Hank. - How are you doing? - [Jim] Sorry to hear about your mother. - Thanks, commander. This is my wife, Inez. - Hi, Inez, nice to meet you. - Hi, it's a pleasure meeting you, Commander. Hank speaks very highly of you. - Well, you got yourself a fine man. - Well, thank you. - [Jim] Listen, if you guys need anything, just give me a yell. - Hey, I appreciate it, sir. - All right. - Thank you. - [Jim] All right, take care. - Okay. - Susan, where's Jeremy? (dramatic synth and percussion music) (fountain splashing) Jeremy! - [Jeremy] Dad! - Jeremy, come on, son. Get out of the water. - Dad, Jeremy take bath. (serene acoustic guitar and flute music) - [Jim] Come on, Jeremy. Take your seatbelt off. Push the button down, good job! - Thank you, mm-hmm. - [Jim] Hi, Phyllis. - Well, hi, Jim. - How are you? - I'm great. How are you? - I'm good, thanks. - Good, I didn't know you were coming in today. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah, we decided to stop by for a few minutes. - And who's this big boy with you? - Well, this big boy is Jeremy. - No? Hi, Jeremy, I'm Phyllis. It's been a long time since I've seen you. Good to see you again. You've grown up so much. - Yeah, he has grown up. He's 12 years old today. - No? - Yep. - You are a birthday boy? (Jim chuckles) Hm, let me see. I think I might have something for the birthday boy here. - Oh. - Can I tempt you with some candy? How about some candy? - Candy. - Yeah. - What have you gotta tell Phyllis? - Thank you, Phyllis. - You are so welcome, Jeremy. - [Jim] We thought we'd stop by and surprise Susan, take her out to lunch. Is she available? - How nice, let me check. - Oh, Phyllis, don't tell her about us. - Susan? Yes, you have a very special visitor here to see you. Uh-huh, I'll send him on back. Head on back. - Okay, great, thank you. - Uh-huh, have a great lunch. - [Jim] Say thank you. - Thank you. - Okay. (Jim chuckles) - Hi, honey. - Hi. What are you doing here? - Well, the birthday boy and I thought we'd take you out to lunch. - Oh, well good timing, I could use a break. (smooches) Happy birthday, sweetheart. Now, where would you like to go and eat? - Pizza, pizza, pizza! (Jim and Susan laugh) - I think he wants pizza. - Pizza it is, let's go. You want to go to Stefano's? - Yeah! - That sounds great. - [Employees] Happy birthday, Jeremy. - Oh, thanks, guys. That was really sweet. - You're welcome. Have a good lunch. - Okay. - Bye, guys. - Bye. - Bye, bye. - Bye! - Happy birthday. (people socializing) - [Server] Okay, say cheese. - [Family] Cheese! (camera whirs) - Thank you very much. - You're welcome, and happy birthday. - Well, what have you got to say for yourself, birthday boy? - Jeremy happy. - [Jim] Good. - These past 12 years haven't always been easy, but I wouldn't trade 'em for anything in the world. - Well, whoever said that life was supposed to be easy? - (laughs) Right. - (chuckles) Oh, Jeremy. - Oh, Jeremy. - You stinker. Oh, buddy. Happy birthday, sweetheart. - Happy birthday, Jeremy. - Would you like another slice? - Yeah, no, I don't. (all laughing) I have too much already. - Okay. - Phyllis, I found that file we were looking for. - Oh, good. - But don't worry about it 'til tomorrow. And by the way, thank you for what you did for Jeremy today. - Oh, Susan, no thanks necessary. He is such a special little boy. - He is, isn't he? - He really is. You're very lucky. - [Susan] Well, goodnight. - Goodnight. (dramatic synth music) - [Policeman] Truck fits the description of the one used in that gas station robbery yesterday. Run a check. - [Policewoman] Unit Eight to San Diego. Run a check on a black Ford pickup, California license number 1-0-Juliet-Echo-9-7-9. (siren wailing) - [Dispatch] San Diego to Unit Eight, proceed with caution. The vehicle is stolen and believed to have been used in an armed robbery. (sirens wailing) (tires squealing) (engine roars) (siren wails) (tires squealing) (cars crashing) (dial tone rings) (buttons beeping) (dramatic piano music) (phone ringing) - Hello? - Dad, there's been an accident. - Oh, oh no, what happened, son? - Susan's dead. She was killed in a car wreck. She died instantly. - Oh, son, I am so sorry. How's Jeremy? - I haven't told him yet. - Look, Mom and I, we'll take the first flight out in the morning. - No, Dad, just let me take care of everything here. - No, that's nonsense. Look, we'll fly in, we'll get a rental car, and we should be there before dark. - Okay, well, I'll see you tomorrow. Dad? Tell Mom that we'll be all right. - Okay, I love you, kid. (Jim sighs) - Son, I need to talk to you. - [Jeremy] Mommy, Mommy! - The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. He leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul. He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for His name's sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil. - Mommy, wake up! - For thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. - Mommy, wake up! - Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies. Thou anoint'st my head with oil. My cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord. - I know this is hard for you to understand. - But make Mommy wake up! - I can't. That's not Mommy. - But I saw her. - Sweetheart, it's like this. There's no life left in here. Mommy's not living here anymore. Mommy's gone to live in heaven. This is just an empty shell. Someday you'll understand. - Are you sure you want to retire, son? - I don't see any way around it, Dad. (serene acoustic guitar music) - [Elizabeth] Well, I've got Jeremy down for the night. What's this I hear about retirement? - Jim's thinking about leaving the Navy. - I don't see any way around it, Mom. It's the only thing I can do. I've got in almost 21 years. I'll receive a full pension. - The money doesn't mean anything to you, son. - No, but spending time with Jeremy does. I just don't know how much longer we have together. - [Elizabeth] Well, don't worry about Jeremy because Austin and I talked about it on the way out here, and we thought Jeremy could just go back with us and he could stay as long as you need him to. - Okay. - [Elizabeth] Okay. - He can go back with you, and I'll be there as soon as I can get discharged. It may take six months. - [Elizabeth] Well, you take all the time you need 'cause Jeremy will be just fine. - I know he will, Mom, as long as Dad takes him fishing every chance he gets. (all laughing) - Well, then it's settled. Austin, let's go pack Jeremy's bags. (people socializing) - Thank you both for being here. - Well, you take care of yourself, and you need anything at all, you call us. - (smooches) Thank you, Mother. I hope Jeremy's not too much trouble for you. - This Jeremy? This Jeremy's going to be perfect. - Thanks, Dad. - We'll see you when you get there. - And, Jeremy, you be a good boy. (sentimental orchestral music) You mind your grandparents, you hear me? I love you, Jeremy. - [Jeremy] Jeremy stay. - No, you go with your grandparents. Just go. - [Announcer] Can I have your attention please? Flight 1531 from San Diego, California, to Huntsville, Alabama, will be boarding at gate A6 in 10 minutes. Thank you. (mellow acoustic guitar music) (door knocking) - Coming, hold your horses. Hello, boys. - [Matt] Hi, Mr. Winter. We just wanted to see if we could go fishing down at your pond. - Well, of course it's all right, but it's too cold. You won't catch anything. It's only February. - We know, we just want to kill time any way. Who's that? - Oh, this is my grandson, Jeremy. - [Matt] You want to go fishing? - Fishing. Fishing. - Well, I don't know, fellas. Let me think about this. - We'll watch him real close, Mr. Winter. - Well, okay, let me get him his lucky fishing hat. Okay, let's go down to the barn. I'll get a life vest and a pole. - Hey, Matt. - Yeah? - What do you think it'd be like? - What? - To be like him. - I don't know. I don't think it'd be that much different. I mean, he looks happy enough. - If you had a choice, would you rather be like him and happy? Or would you rather be strong, healthy, and unhappy? - I don't know. (door knocking) - I'll get it. Austin, the boys are back. Well, did you boys have any luck today? - Jeremy's the only one that caught anything. (chuckles) He wouldn't let us throw it back. - Caught one, I did! - You sure did. Austin, what are you going to do about this? - Well, I can't eat it, that's for sure. I guess we'll just have to mount it. Come on, fellas, let's go out in the barn. - Jeremy? Time for breakfast. Jeremy? (Jeremy groaning) Jeremy, time to get up. We're going to town. Jeremy. (Jeremy groaning) Jeremy. Austin. - [Austin] Yes, ma'am. - Can you come up here? - [Austin] What can I do for you? - Jeremy's not having a good day. I think we should just stay home. - No, you go on ahead. I'll stay here with Jeremy. (Jeremy groaning) (upbeat wooden chimes music) - Hello, Jim, I'm Susan Brewster. - Nice to meet you. (water splashes) - And to be true and loyal to him so long as you both shall live? - I will. (water splashes) - I can't love him if he's gonna be taken away from me. (water splashes) - Mommy, wake up! - I love you, Jeremy. (waves crashing) (seagulls cawing) (gravel crunching) (engine rumbling) - [Matt] Hi. - [Elizabeth] Hi. - Well, look who's here, Jeremy. - [Matt] We're getting up a little football game down at the school. Can Jeremy come watch? - You want to go, Jeremy? - Go! - (laughs) Matt, you be sure to have him back by supper, okay? - [Matt] Yes, ma'am. - Good. - [Matt] Got you a jersey. - Those Grissom boys, they sure are something special. - Yeah, they really are. (engine rumbling) (kids playing) - Y'all ready? - Yeah! (kids grunting) - Why'd you bring the freak? - Yeah! - Jeremy's just gonna watch. - Well, he better stay out of my way. Same teams as last week. - Sure, we'll give you a chance to get even with us. - Y'all kick off. (lively rock music) - Hike! (kids grunting) - [Johnny] Down, set, hike! (kids grunting) - High-five. - High-five, Jeremy do high-five. - [Johnny] Get out of my way, freak. - Hey, he didn't do anything to you. - So, what are you gonna do about it? What are you looking at? - He's not the freak. You are. (peaceful acoustic guitar music) (Austin claps) - What's the matter, buddy? - Daddy. - Oh. (phone rings) Hello? Jim, you won't believe this. I'm sitting here playing checkers with Jeremy, and all of a sudden, he walks over to the phone and says, "Daddy," and the phone rang. - Yeah, I know. Sometimes he's pretty amazing. Susan used to say that he would just stand in front of the door and call out for me, and I'd just walk in. So how is everyone? - Jeremy's really having fun here this summer. He and Matt and Greg and the kids next door, they've really become really great buddies. (laughs) Hey, the five months he's been here, he's really enjoyed it and so have we. But hey, enough about us, what about you? Have you gotten your release date yet? - Yes, sir, that's why I'm calling. I should be home in about three weeks. - That's great! We'll be looking forward to it. - Yeah, me too, Dad. Could I say hi to Jeremy? - Well, I think so. Hold on. Jeremy, it's your daddy. - Daddy. - Hey, buddy, I'm just calling to tell you that I love you, and I'll be seeing you real soon. - Bye, bye. - I love you. - Love you. - Bye, son. (phone clatters) (bell rings) (whistle blows) (reverent synth music) - Well, Jim, I hate to see you go, but I'd probably do the same thing if I were in your shoes. - Well, thank you, sir. The Navy has been good to me, especially you, and I appreciate it. - You're a fine officer, Jim. I'm sure you'll do real well on the outside. I wish you the best. (upbeat acoustic guitar music) (engine rumbling) - Hey, Jim, you finally made it. - [Jim] Hey, Dad. (Austin laughs) (groans) Where's Mom and Jeremy? - They're both in the kitchen making cookies. Come on in. Leave the stuff in the car. We can get that later. - Yeah, okay, Mom's grits, huh? Dad, I really appreciate you and Mom taking us in. - Are you kidding? Mama's been in hog heaven having you home after all these years. Besides, maybe you and Jeremy can breathe some life into this old place. He's really enjoying himself here. He's a great kid. - Yeah. - Hey, now how are you doing? - Oh, I don't know, Dad. It's only been six months. But, I do know that I am looking forward to spending more time with Jeremy and you and Mom. - Me too. - Jeremy, look. I want you to give your dad some of these cookies. These right here are his favorites. - Oh, yes! Thank you. (laughs) Give me that cookie. Thank you. Oh, it smells delicious. Mm, it is good to be home. (Austin and Elizabeth laughing) - Hey, Austin! - Bye, Nancy! (chuckles) That's one of the new teachers over at the school. Pretty, isn't she? (peaceful acoustic guitar music) Hey, Ed, how are you? - [Ed] Hey, Austin. Hey, Jimbo, I heard you was coming back home. - How you doing, Ed? - All right, Jeremy, you've grown like a weed. - Yeah, talk about growing, you haven't changed much. - Ah, if you don't count the 40 pounds I've added and my hair falling out, then I'm gonna agree with you. - (laughs) Maybe you have changed a little bit. (laughs) - I've got a customer, excuse me, and I'll see you around. - All right, take care. - [Ed] Welcome home, man. - Thanks, Ed. - Hey, Jimmy! - Hey, Mike. - Hey, listen. I'm sorry to hear about your wife. - Well, thank you. - But, you know, it's good to see you back. We could use a good third baseman on the softball team this summer. - (chuckles) I don't know. I haven't played ball in a long time. - Oh, come on. It's like riding a bike. What do you say, can we count on you? - Maybe next season, I've got a lot of things I need to work out right now. - Yeah, yeah, I understand. Well, hey, Jeremy! Roll Tide, bud! - Roll Tide. - Hey, Mike, thanks for asking. - [Mike] Sure thing, bud, take care. - All right. - Hey, Jim, do you remember my old friend Fred Parker? - Hey, Fred. - Hey, how are you doing? - I'm doing good. It's good to see you. - He just asked if we want to go up on the lake for a boat ride. - Want to go for a boat ride, Jeremy? - Boat ride. - I think that means yes. That sounds great. (engine rumbling) (peaceful bluegrass music) - [Elizabeth] I brought you some coffee. - Oh, thanks, Mama. (reflective acoustic guitar music) I haven't heard a whip-poor-will since I joined the Navy. - (chuckles) I can still remember watching you leave as if it were yesterday. Life is so precious, and short. - [Jim] Yes it is. - I know you don't feel too much like talking about the future right now, but life does go on, and if you don't stay in the race, it will just pass you right by. Well... I'll just go up and check on Jeremy before I turn in. Goodnight, my sweet son. - Goodnight, Mama.

I'm Jim Winter. - It's nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - I know he's gonna require some special attention. Is there anything I need to know in particular? - Well, sometimes he communicates rather well, and other times, it's like trying to talk to a wall. I think the best thing to do is just try to treat him like the other children as much as you possibly can. - I think I can handle that. - I hope so. Listen, I'll be working with my dad over at Winter Aviation, and we're staying at my parents' house if you need me. - Okay. - All right. - Well, have a nice day. - Thank you, you too.

It's impossible to get our work done in the classroom with Jeremy in here. He's five, six years older than the other kids, and he's so disruptive. It's not fair. It demands all my attention, and the other kids are not getting any of it. I really think he needs to be in a special school. - Ms. Miller, I know that Jeremy can be difficult, but he will settle down. He likes it here. Look. We've just been through so many changes lately. (Jeremy moans) His mother... His mother passed away recently. I just don't think that he could handle changing schools again right now. Please, try to understand. - I am trying!

You're gonna learn a little bit about what it's like to grow Christmas trees, and we'll see that you get a chance to go through the gift shop, but first, who would like to take a ride on a covered wagon? - [Class] Me! - All right. - [Jim] Yeah, I think one more little guy here. (upbeat acoustic guitar music) Okay, everybody's on. - [Mr. Shell] Is everybody on? - Yep, let's go. (horses clopping) Hey, Jeremy, look. It looks like real snow, with Santa and Frosty. (upbeat banjo music) (kids clapping) (tractor rumbling) (tractor rumbling) - Hey, Jeremy's driving the tractor! - Oh no! - Jeremy? Nancy, have you seen Jeremy? - I thought he was with you. - I thought he was with you. - Okay, listen up! Has anyone seen Jeremy? - Hey, there's some kid out here on my tractor. - Jeremy! - Jeremy! (playful country music) (tractor rumbling) (kids cheering) (tractor rumbling) - Jeremy, that was very dangerous. (groans) Don't you ever do that again! - (laughs) Don't go so hard on him. He didn't hurt nobody. (laughs) - Well, I don't think it was very funny. - I did! (all laughing) - Okay, so it was funny, but don't you ever do that again, you stinker. (Mr. Shell laughing) (Jim sighs) (contemplative piano and acoustic guitar music) - Mama, Papa! Daddy, wake up! - Well, good morning. - Morning, Merry Christmas. (Austin grumbles) - Merry Christmas to you. - I see Jeremy's not the only early bird this morning. - No, Santa's been here. (Jim and Elizabeth laughing) So listen, while he's opening some presents, why don't we open some? - That sounds great. - My present is watching Jeremy open his gifts. - This one is for you from your dad. - Oh, you guys didn't have to do that. - Yes, I did, if you're gonna keep up with Jeremy and I this summer. - It must have something to do with fishing if I'm keeping up with you guys. (Elizabeth laughs) Oh, great, a new tackle box, with lures and sinkers and bobbers and all kind of great stuff. Thank you. - You're welcome. - You're welcome. - Now, let's see what Santa left for Mom. - Oh. - There you go. - Thank you, son. - Oh, you're welcome. - Okay, you want to help me with this? I'm worse than a kid. - I know you ripped the bow, so you ripped it off, can't use it next year. - (laughs) Okay. Whoops! There you go. Oh my goodness, boy, beautiful. I might even look good in this. - [Jim] You'll look gorgeous, Mom. (Elizabeth laughs) - It's her favorite color, too. - Oh, it is. Thank you. - Dad, this is for you. It's a little heavy, so be careful. - Oh, son. I don't need any help with this. (Elizabeth laughs) Just ruined that paper. - Let me get up. (chuckles) Oh. - Oh, son, is this... The last new flight jacket I put on was in Korea. Thank you. - You're welcome, merry Christmas, Dad. - (laughs) Jeremy, oh, look! Ah, this is from Papa and me. - You want some help there, bud? (paper scratching) You're gonna like this. (Elizabeth laughs) - (gasps) Oh boy, Jeremy's excited. (Jeremy squeals) (all laughing) - I've never seen enjoy Christmas as much as he is today. - Well, he is growing up. (laughs) - Yeah, he is. - Merry Christmas, sweetheart. - Merry Christmas to you, babe. (phone rings) - (sighs) I'll get that. - Okay. - And then I've gotta go up and change clothes. See you later. - Okay. (sentimental piano music) - Merry Christmas, Susan. (waterfall roaring) (birds chirping) - Ms. Miller, pretty. Sit by Jeremy. - Well, good morning to you, too. Good morning, Mr. And Mrs. Winter. - Good morning. - Jim. Isn't this a beautiful Palm Sunday? - It is gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous. Come sit with us, Nancy. - I'd be delighted to. (reverent piano music) ♪ What was the reason He came down from heaven ♪ I was ♪ Who was the cause for the old rugged cross ♪ I was ♪ Who was the vessel headed into rough water - Okay listen up, everybody. I have a very special assignment for you. I want you each to take these plastic eggs home with you and bring 'em back tomorrow with something inside that shows new life. Now, after we do our math lesson tomorrow, we'll open up the eggs, and you'll each get to share with me and the rest of the class about what you put inside and why. Now, does everybody understand? - [Class] Yes, ma'am. - Okay, take out your reading books now. (contemplative piano music) (washing machine cranking and whirring) (washing machine rattling) Oh, man! Shoot. Hi, this is Nancy Miller. I live at 800 North Patton in Florence. Could you please send someone over? My washing machine is leaking all over my floor. Uh-huh, yeah, thanks, bye. (contemplative piano music) Good morning, put your eggs in the basket and go and take your seats, please. Okay, does everyone have their eggs in the basket up here? Nope, here we go. Thank you. Okay, let's take out our math homework. Yes, Ty? - Can we please open the eggs now? - No, we're gonna do our math homework first. (class groans) - Okay, shush, shush, we're gonna do our math homework before we open the eggs. Now, Chad, will you please take out your math homework and read the first problem to us and give us your answer? - The farmer has three chickens. The first chicken laid two eggs. The second chicken laid three eggs. If his egg basket contains eight eggs when he gets back home, now how many did the third chicken lay? Three. - Ms. Miller, is that right? - Right, Drew, very good. Okay, guys, we have a few minutes before recess, so how 'bout if we open some of the eggs? (class cheers) - Sh, okay. Let's see what we've got in this pink one. Ooh, a flower. A flower is a sign of new life. When the flower peeks up through the ground at the end of winter, we know that spring is finally here. - That's mine, Ms. Miller. - Very good choice, Kimberly. Let's see, how 'bout a green one? Oh, what have we got here? A butterfly, that's a sign of new life, also. We know that caterpillars turn into butterflies. - That one is mine. - Good choice, Judy, that was a very good choice. Okay, let's see. How 'bout a yellow one? Ooh, moss. Moss is also a sign of new life. - My daddy helped me find it. - He did? That's a good sign, Ty. Let's see, a blue one. - Aren't you going to talk about my egg, Ms. Miller? (contemplative piano music) - Your egg was empty, Jeremy. - I know, but so was Jesus' tomb. - Do you know why Jesus' tomb was empty? - Jesus was killed and put in the tomb, and his father raised him up so he lives in heaven. (bell rings) (somber piano music) (Nancy sobbing) - Well, let's put your books in here, get you ready to go home, yeah. We had a good day today, huh? Yeah, it was a good time. (door knocks) - Hi. - [Jeremy] Daddy. - How was Jeremy today? - Jeremy is fine, just fine. - I was thinking, Nancy. There was a guy at the hangar today, and he was telling me about this great new restaurant over across the river. And, well, maybe you and I could... Uh-- - I thought you'd never ask. (both laughing) When? - How about six o'clock tonight? - Can Jeremy come, too? - Jeremy? Sure, so we'll just pick you up around 6:00. - Sounds like fun. - Great, we'll see you then. - Okay. - Come on, son. We've got a date tonight. (chuckles) - [Nancy] Bye. - Goodbye. (people socializing) Would you excuse me for a moment? - Sure. - Jeremy, why don't you come with me? - No, stay with Ms. Miller. - Oh, it's fine, he can stay with me. We'll be okay. - Okay, great, I'll be right back. - How was your dinner, babe? - Here we go, folks, two chocolate Bavarian cakes and one hot fudge sundae, enjoy. - Thank you. (Jeremy groans) - (gasps) Oh, gosh, it's okay. - I'm sorry I spilled it! - It's okay! - I spilled it! - It's okay! - Calm down, we're gonna be fine. We're gonna get it cleaned up. - Here, guys, let me help you with this. - We're gonna get it cleaned up. Oh, look, now could you get him another ice cream, please? - [Server] Yes certainly, ma'am. - It's okay, it's fine. It's gonna be okay. - Looks like someone had an accident. - Oh, Jeremy's ice cream got spilled, but we've got it cleaned up, and they're bringing him some more. - Oh, I'm sorry, it got all over your blouse. - You know, I just got my washing machine fixed. It'll be fine. It's all right. - Nancy, I was thinking. My folks are gonna be taking Jeremy over to the U.S. Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville this weekend, and I was thinking that maybe you would like to spend the day with me on Saturday. - I'd love to. - Great. - It'd be fun. (contemplative synth music) (people screaming) (audience cheering and clapping) (mellow acoustic guitar music) (ducks quacking) (waterfall babbling) - I had a great time today. - Thank you for showing me some of the most beautiful scenery I've ever seen. - It was my pleasure, believe me. So have you got any big plans for the summer? - Not really, I was gonna go visit my mom in Washington, but she's gonna be in Europe most of the summer, so I think I'm gonna just hang around here. How 'bout you? - Well, I thought I'd take Jeremy to do some fishing. Maybe run over to Atlanta, try to catch a few of the Braves' games. Would you like to come with us? - Fishing or to the Braves' game? - How about both? I kind of like having you around. (upbeat jazz music) (mellow acoustic guitar music) - [Rick] Hey, Austin. - Hey, we're just finishing up. - [Rick] How are you doing? - Hey, Rick, this is my son, Jim. - Hi, Rick. - Jim, this is Rick Taylor. - It's nice to meet you. - Well, same here. So, you got her ready to go? - Jim just getting ready to take it up for a test. You want to go up with him? - [Rick] Sure, if it's all right with you. - Sure, it's fine. In fact, it's your plane, why don't you fly? - All right. (chuckles) (engine rumbling) Well, I'm glad I finally got to meet you, Jim. Your dad used to talk about you all the time. Said you were a fighter pilot. - I was. - What brought you back here? - It's a long story. Basically, it was a decision to spend more time with my family. - Well, I can understand that. Sorry to hear about your wife. A few years ago, I lost my wife, too. It's tough when you wake up one morning and realize that all the plans that you've made together have just been canceled. You don't think anyone can replace her, and they can't. You just can't understand it. I don't think we were meant to. Main thing is don't give up hope 'cause sooner or later, you're gonna meet somebody that'll give you a reason to get up every morning. Way I look at it, Jim, you and me got a second chance to find happiness, and a lot of folks don't get that. Just don't let her get away once you find her. Now, let's see what this baby can do. (engine roaring) - Hey, how'd it go? - Oh, just great, Austin. Let me sign something here and I'll get out of your hair. We'll be all settled up here. There you are. - Hey. - Good to do business with you. - Hey, yeah, good to see you, guy. You take care. - Hey, Rick, thanks. - Listen, you ever need to talk to somebody, I'll be around. - Great, appreciate it. Thank you. Hey, Dad, you got anything else today? - [Austin] No, I think that's pretty much it for today. - I think I'll take off. - [Austin] Where you going? - It's a surprise. (serene acoustic guitar music) (doorbell rings) (door knocks) Nancy, wake up, sleepy head! (door knocks) Nancy, it's Jim! (doorbell rings) (door knocks) Nancy! (door knocks) Nancy! (door knocks) Nancy! - Jim, what's wrong? - Nothing, why do you ask? - Well, what time is it? - [Jim] 6:30. - 6:30, what are you doing here? - [Jim] Well, I just bought a boat, and Jeremy and I are gonna try it out. Would you like to come? - (laughs) Um, yeah. Let me go get dressed and I need a cup of coffee. - Consider it done. - Okay. - Yes, she's going! (laughs) (serene acoustic guitar music) (engine rumbling) (crickets chirping) Hey, buddy. (groans) I can't believe how big you're getting. (Jim sighs) (peaceful acoustic guitar music) You feel a little bit warm. You're not getting sick, are you? - Jeremy sleepy. - You probably just got too much sun today. Come on, let me take you up and tuck you in. - Goodnight. (smooches) - (groans) Oh, here we go. Put your arms around me. (groans) Oh goodness, you're getting big. I'll be back in a minute, Nancy. - Okay. - Okay, there you go, son. Goodnight, (smooches) I love you. - Goodnight, I love you, too. - Don't forget to say your prayers. - Thank you, God, for boat. Thank you, God, for Mama, Papa, and Daddy. Make Jeremy very happy. Tell Mommy, Jeremy miss her. Tell Mommy, thank you for Ms. Nancy. Ms. Nancy make Jeremy and Daddy very happy. Tell Mommy, Jeremy and Daddy love her. Amen. (crickets chirping) - You get him into bed? - Yeah, poor guy was exhausted. - He'll probably sleep like a log tonight. (Jim laughs) I was gonna go shopping on Monday. I thought I might come pick Jeremy up and take him with me. - Sounds great, if you don't think he'd be in the way. - No, it'll be fun. - I really appreciate you taking time for me and Jeremy. - Well, you and Jeremy are very important to me. (phone ringing) (dramatic piano music) - [Jim] One more time, close it. - [Austin] That ought to do it. - Looks good to me. - Let's give it a try. - Jim, Nancy just called! They've taken Jeremy to the hospital! He's very ill! - Let me get Mama. We'll meet you at the hospital. - I'm Jeremy Winter's dad. He was brought in a few minutes ago. Where is he? - [Receptionist] He's in intensive care. Go down the hallway halfway and take a left. - I'm sorry, but there's just nothing else that we can do. - [Jim] Nancy, where is he? - Jim, this is Dr. Holcomb. - How's Jeremy? - [Dr. Holcomb] Mr. Winter, Jeremy's very ill. He's in a coma. His kidneys have shut down. He's not going to make it. - Oh, no, not now, don't take my boy! - [Dr. Holcomb] He's sedated. He's not in any pain. - I want to see him. - Sure, he's in the room behind you. (machinery beeping) - (smooches) Hi, son. It's me. It's Daddy. (sniffles) I'm here. Everything's gonna be all right. I promise. I love you, son. (heart monitor beeps) (Nancy crying) (heart monitor beeps) - He's gone. - (crys) Oh, Jeremy. (sobs) (Nancy crying) - Jim, Ms. Kimber brought over some food. I think maybe you should get changed and have something to eat. - No thanks, Mom. I just feel like I need some time alone. I'm gonna go out for a while.

Nancy, I want to talk to you. - What is it? - When I lost Susan, part of me died. But I felt like I had to go on to take care of Jeremy. (sentimental piano music) I gave up the only job that I ever loved to be with my boy. Now, Jeremy's gone. I guess what I'm trying to say is that life is very uncertain. I don't know how many years or how many days or how many minutes we have left. But I do know that I want to spend mine with you. - [Nancy] Oh, Jim. - Will you marry me? - Yes!
