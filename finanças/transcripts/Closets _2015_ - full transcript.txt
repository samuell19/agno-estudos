Mum... I didn't... Mum, I didn't... I didn't... I didn't mean to... Enough! That's it! No more! Sit down. Look at yourself! Look at you! You said that was the last time. Get it off! Get it off now! - Please! - Get it off! Look at your face! Look at it! Why are you doing this? Get it off your face! You said you wouldn't do this again! Why are you doing this to me? That was the last time. No more! This stops now! Mum... Mum? What are you doing in my room? Are you going to hurt me? Help! This is 12 Temperance Drive, right? I'm Henry Clever. Do you know me? Why is that on my wall? Do you know him? Daley? I'm a fan of his swimming. Daley? I've never seen anything like him. Wow. 2016? Yeah. October the 11th, 2016. Seriously? Because, I'm not joking, in the closet, it's 1986. Oh, God, it stinks in here, Ben. What's up with you? Looks like you've seen a ghost. Hello? Why can't she see you? Oh, my God. I've got a brain tumour. What are you on about now? Those, um... swimming trunks are very tight, aren't they? What? Larry's got this calendar at work. August's my favourite. I'm not like him. I didn't say you were. But if you were... Or not, I mean, either way, um... You know it's really important to use protection. I mean, I don't have anything against any of it, but, you know, AIDS and all that other stuff, I just want you to be safe. Because, you know, girls can get it, too. AIDS. My mum was telling me about this. Gays are dropping like flies! And Larry at work, his ex has just been diagnosed with HIV and... You know, it's... That's it for life now. It's pills and pills. People talk about it like it's a thing of the past, but it's not. And I just want you to be so careful. You know, people, um... People need to wrap it up. It's not exactly an urgent worry. And syphilis? Don't even get me starred on syphilis! - Protection, protection, protection. - Mum, just stop! Alright. Chill your beans. Open a window, will you? And take that plate downstairs, it's growing mould on it. You're going to get ill. Hygiene, hygiene, hygiene. Why couldn't she see me? Ow! What you playing at? I've thought about it, too. Lewis and Paul at school, they keep calling me faggot. They wrote it on my wall 73 times. "You're dead, faggot." Again and again. No way! They wrote on the wall of your house? It's like a profile wall thing. A social media thing on the iPad. You can talk to each other instantly. Like a walkie-talkie, but you write it? Weird. Do they still have Ness? You know, like you get in Nintendo? I want one so bad! No, it's all... PlayStations and Xbox now. What's that? I'm... I'm sorry. My brain's totally mashed. So, they wrote on your... ... wall, instant-like thing. Yeah. They spread around the school that I watched them in the showers after football. They put pictures of me on lnstagram. Cut my head out and put it on men having... sex. Hey... Hey, it's OK. Are you wearing make-up? Why, do you think that's weird? No. There's, like, a thing for that now. A Drag Race thing on TV. For real? Because I... I love it! Performing! You know, like Cher and Bette Midler? Wait, they're not dead now, are they? I don't think so. Chefs a robot now. Mum... My mum keeps calling me a pervert. She thinks I'm mentally ill. Which would explain why I'm sitting in a closet with someone in 2016, wouldn't it? You're not a pervert. Take a look at this. This... is my favourite show on TV. This guy here, he's going out with this guy and they're getting married and everything. And then there's this guy and he's trying to break them up, but it's just non-stop drama! Right! I'm staying here and marrying that stud Daley! Your mam had a right old perv when she came in, at that calendar! My mum would've just burnt it. You know, you should just tell her what's going on at school. No way. She'd just go in and make it worse. How could it be worse than hiding away in here? Who did this to you? Tell me what happened. I met a boy. And he was just like me. He... He was a pervert, Mum. Only he wasn't there. - Just leave it. - Tell me their names. I was in a land where gays can get married and dress up on TV! You need to let me help you stop this. It's not right! You're not right! Ben, talk to me. I'm always here for you, and I always will be. Well, go on. Kick me out! I waited to miss the bus. I do that every day, and I walk to school, because I'm terrified, Mum. This time may knew what I was doing and they were waiting for me. Smash all my records, break all my things! Smack it out of me! They punched me, they spat on me and they kicked me, screaming, "Faggot!" I didn't want you to be worried. I am not going to let them get away with this. I'll go straight to the head. We'll move schools, whatever it takes. One day, I'll be dressed up on a stage and I'll be proud. You'll see! And guess what I'm... ... gay. What difference will that make at a new school? You are not gay. You're just different. What about AIDS? I'm not going to get AIDS, Mum. Protection, protection, protection! I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. I just... It's just the shock of it. Hearing it out loud. Listen to what I'm saying. I'm listening to everything. And you know what I feel? I feel love. If you are, you are. You're my son! And it's OK. It's not OK! (Ben's mum) Oh, my God! Come on, come on, come on! Ben? Ben? (Ben's mum) Yeah, hello, ambulance, please. Ambulance. Ben. Ben, come on, sweetheart. Come on... Get it all up. Come on, Ben? (Ben's mum) I don't know what's happened. He seems to have taken an overdose of something. I don't know what it is. It's OK. Spit it out. Spit it out... (Ben's mum) No, somebody's looking after him now. I don't who. Somebody's here looking after him. We're trying to make him sick... That's it. Get it all up. Cone on, darling. Come on, sweetheart. It'll be fine. You're gonna be fine, darling. You gonna be fine. Come on. Ben! Ben, sweetheart! Ben, get it all up, love. Get it all up. Come on! Get it all up, Ben! Get it all up! Come on, darling. Come on, sweetheart... That's it. How did you know? He's so lucky to have you. Who are you? Tell him... Just tell him it's going to be alright now. No more need for closets. Thank you.
