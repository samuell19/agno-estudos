- Mother. I can't find him anywhere. - Never mind him, just go away. Did he hide away? Why won't he tell you where he went? Don't you know where he's gone? - I can't find him. - Just say farewell. Why won't you tell ma??? Just go, you won't catch your train. I thought you were at the station by now. I'll see if I find him out back! My father! He drank! He drank back there. I saw him! Now you can go. Hear me? You'll be late! I'll check in here first. That old bastard shall get what he deserves, I'll tell him too! Perhaps he's here. Tell me that I feel hurt that he would not let me say goodbye to him. He would've told me that he didn't want me to take the trip, but he didn't utter a word! I knew it, tell him that I knew that he wouldn't want me to take the trip! I'm still leaving! But he could have told me in my face! Because that's the right thing to do, hear me? And you, stop saying goodbye, hear me? And I think him for everything anyway! Not even my siblings! But I still do, tell him this! Tell him in my stead! THE DISCIPLES Tickets, please... Tickets... ("I shall never forget") Wake up already... Get out of here. Go, all of you. Good clay to you. Excuse me, officer, which way to find the Peter Pazmany University? Go that way, then left. But take care. - Good morning. - What do you want here? I'd like to enroll. And we should throw in some tuition exemption too, right? Yes, sir. Go right home, son, you're late: whoever wants to become a college students needs to know that enrollment applications were clue 2 months ago. What will happen now? A graduate told me that now is the time. - Back in your village, huh? - Yes, in my village. Go all the way back to him. Come back in half a year, then you can cross-register. - What does cross-registry mean? - Ahh... Good clay to you... Leave immediately. You may only enter here when the lamp is green. Can't you see we're working in here? Who do you think you are? - You have nothing to do here. - Are you deaf? - I'd like to enroll. - This is not the dean's office... But I also need tuition exemption. I know. I know. I'm too late! - But I can't go home like this. - Come back another time. But I need to arrange this! I need to become a student by all means... How good are your matriculation grades, sir? Didn't you hear? The professor asked how good are your school grades. Excellent! - Where did you graduate? - Didn't you hear? Where did you? At the Vac Piarists. - What's your father's line of work? - Day laboring farming. - Where? - Around Nagykőrös. Around Nagykőrös... What is around there again? According my survey data, professor, the water there is iodine deficient. - What is our water like? - Who surveyed that area? Korda and myself. We indicated the iodine deficiency. Many folks are goitrous there. And what is your suggestion? We need to transport iodine-enriched salt to the stores there. Professor, sir: this one has no goiter. Iodine deficiency depresses mental capacities as well. I was always a straight A pupil. Here's my matriculation paper... My school and my poverty certificate. It's alright. - What do you wish to become? - A law student. - And after that? - After that... After that I presume you wish to become a lord. Sir. I didn't ask you at all! I asked you. What are your plans? Please, sir, my thoughts don't stretch that far into the future... I just want to give up the peasant's life and I don't want to become a priest either; I'm a good learner. Well! We need to enroll Jozsef Feher with full tuition exemption. Signed: Zoltan Magyary. A professor of civil service and financial law. Who told you to solicit protection from the professor? - No one. - No one? Whoever it was, you did a splendid job. An honest peasant kid, a straight A Piarist pupil... That someone really knows what makes the professor tick. - What are you, physicians? - Yes, the physicians of the world. Not any less than the world. huh? And how are you curing it? We define the ailments precisely. then we devise the medication. - And is this all yours only? - Only three rooms as of now. We're a research institute. partners of the professor. Didn't that someone relate that to you? I surmise you heard all kinds of bad things about us. What are you going on about? Leave me alone! Wait. Wait, please. Stop when you're asked to! The professor sent me after you, I need to escort you to the dean's. - I can find my way there. - Wait, do you have 20 pengos on you? Because that's the enrollment fee. I don't. Well. I'll lend it to you, come on. Welcome to Budapest. This is your first time here, right? - How do you like the city? - It's big... very big indeed. Yes, it's big. Big and sick. The sick capital of a sick country. I heard you are its physicians. Why do you think this country fails to work efficiently? Why are you peasants living miserably and exploited? Why was this country left out of the global industrial revolution? - Could you tell me this? - No. I just enrolled here. Then don't you pick any other professors but Magyary. He and his disciples have mapped the entire country, collected a vast amount of data, all the facts: they intend to prepare the preplanned financial control of the country. state-saving reforms. Keep your voice down! What are yo talking about? Come with me! - Please, sir, please! - Yes, mademoiselle? Sir, do you know Imre Torok? Imre Torok? I know him, I'm a friend of his. - A friend of his? - Yes. But he has many enemies too, right? Certainly, mademoiselle: we are about to meet him up there. Do you have a message for him? Tell him that I've read his new book titled The Peasant Revolution. Could you tell him that I'm waiting for him here with this book? I'll tell him, mademoiselle. - And tell him that... - Yes? Tell him that his book shook me deeply. Alright, mademoiselle, I'll make sure to tell him that it shook you. And tell him, that no matter how terrible the way... And I'm waiting. I'm waiting for Imre Torok here! To lmre! To lmre! Your own make? Do you think only the Magyary Institute can own things like this? They have a different kind. All right, lmre, 3000 already! 3 more hours to go, hang on there! The professor and his team conduct the surveys out on the field. This is merely atrial. But the guy still reaps three swaths. Yes, but afterwards he writes up an article how he reaped 3 swaths. On the floor! Imre! The instrument! Bollocks! A harvester loses 6000 calories and that's it! I know it. I lived among them. I ate the same bread they did! Hey lmre. Professor Magyary had already completed this research. Just ask for the results. We conduct our own surveys! We didn't really miss you here... You're conveying the news, huh? - Imre, they're looking for you! - Good, good, in a minute. Hey Imre, this boy enrolled today. The professor asks you to sign him up for the college. We're no longer students. we just live here. Alright, whatever you say happens around here: give him a bed. Do you fancy becoming a village researcher? What am I supposed to be doing? Come on. I'll show you what! But follow me all the way and listen very closely. Are you people fools? Why didn't you come for me at daybreak? All I have to do is wave my hand, bel ami... Imre Torok... Imre Torok, we hereby arrest you for the charge of disrespecting the Hungarian state and class incitement; the verdict says that you have to come with us, do you hear me? I heard you. Last year you wrote on my cell that I'm in for slander. As if I was some sort of a petty blackmailer. - Keep silent. - Why didn't you come at daybreak? I demand that this time you write the complete warrant te> Shut up! If you don't, I'll write up the whole case just as it occurred, from beginning to end! - Are you coming, kid? - Here I am, Imre! Then come and watch! Imre, you have a phone call! Gentlemen. I'll ask for your patience for a moment. Hallo? I'm enchanted, professor, sir. No, sir, not now. I am obstructed at the moment. Not even later. I don't wish to work at your institute any longer. And I won't allow you to have my research results either. I respect you, professor, but I work on my own, and that is good! This is no longer a time of mercy or of reform. I will let you have this country: may you both succumb. That was uncalled for. An exhibition?“. I won't take part in any sort of exhibitions. Nothing less than a revol... Nothing less than a change will help at this point, and that won't be an exhibition. That was also uncalled for! You too. Professor, sir. Do you know who you're talking to? You're kidding, right? Imre Torok? Would you sign my book? I'm called Ilona. Can I have your pen? Would you lend it to me? Are they taking you? Will they lock you up? Lac“ Give this boy a bed. Yes, Imre! Did you get three months? Will they beat you? I'd like to see them try that! I'm neither a communist or a serf to Then what? What are you? Tell me what are you? - Different... - Different... different... The professor sent me: I got you a position so that you can earn some money: pick it up and let us go. - I'm leaving this place. - You're not, you're staying put. - We're looking for Count Alex. - This way please. Thank you. This fine gentleman is my valet. They poured cognac in the champagne. From this minute on. he'll become my... instructor. For this, you will receive... 50 pengos a month and full catering. I will receive a preparation for the economy state exam, as my father won't approve my wedding until I have my degree. You can clearly see how urgent this business is for me, concerning my father who is of advanced age. I don't know a thing about economy, count. You're spooking me. You don't need to: the way I've heard, you're quite bookish. You learn the material and recite it back to me. A single time will do as my conception skills are quite advanced. But I'm unwilling to spend time with incredibly boring books. If you'd do that in my stead, I would be obliged without end. Can I become your disciple, my master? As you've asked, Sir. What did you see on the bill, my master? 960 pengos. You misunderstand me. The monthly wage of thirty families like my own. Yes, that's what I asked. I find you completely agreeable. Except for the glance that you flashed at me now, looking up from the bill. - I couldn't help it. - Me neither! I can't help it either, master. Well, you do have more clout than I do. You're completely mistaken. For instance. I'd never allow myself to glance at you the way you glanced at me. Drink, drink! Come on, master, come on. May I? Merci. If you'd allow me. Count Alex, just a small present... How knowledgeable you are: lam not full enough yet. But this one is full. Let's go. Watch out! Count Alex... watch it! Couldn't you steer clear of it? It's the other guy's job. What if the other guy shares the same principle? Other than me, there's just a single guy in this country who shares this principle, but I usually know where Viki Odeszkal is roaming. Currently he's about to embark on a race in Rome, so I'm sure we're not going to encounter him on these roads. My man... You never raced on the roads like this, huh? Why don't you show some enthusiasm? Soon enough there will be traffic signs everywhere we look. The only thing those are good for is that you can only think a single step further... How boring you people are, master! Everywhere I go, I see folks like you. The Earth is full of you now! How come you know me this well? Count Alex... How come? It happens. Thanks to my foreign trips for instance. Only these days do I fully understand the wording of the old psalms: that God created me for different ends: He keeps telling you people in vain about centuries and battles. you have no individual fantasies or concepts that would assist you in elevating something out of the general twilight. I bet that all you can enthuse about are things like productivity and purposeful skillfulness. Stop drinking that much... Gosh, there's so many of you people, so many... The bathroom, sir. - Your clothes, sir? - They're on me. I understand, sir; where do you wish to dine? In your room. I imagine. Yes. I keep the drinks locked myself: you may drink whenever you wish. But count Alex may not; this is why we don't serve cocktails at lunch: he may not drink. And we do not condone if anyone should serve him drinks, sir. You got a splendid room, master. Forgive me but it's customary that we hide certain things in here. Perhaps that's why you hid me in here as well. That's a good one. Now what? Oh yes... Did you settle in comfortably? Yes; where are the books? I intend to finish one of them tonight. Don't rush, master, don't rush; you can see for yourself that I lack the time to study presently. I'm sure Georg told you about our custom concerning the drinks here. If we don't study, I'm leaving. Let's just do something. Why are you in a rush, master? If you feel like hopping back to Pest to your university, I'll fetch you a driver, huh? And you're free to ride horses, to drive a carriage. If you're in a low mood, you're free to study law too. - You're a lawyer, right? - Right. Go. I will keep you updated. And don't you think that you understood anything at all! Are you a guest here? Are you part of the help? Are you a relative of someone here? Foreigner? Hungarian? Mute? Don't you know how you got in here? And is this something new or you feel like this all the time? Don't you even know who you are? Then can we say that you are... no one? That must be good. Or bad? Of course, being no one must be like... nothing. Am I right? And where are you from? The Moon? A friend told me once that secret agents from the Moon habitually travel to Earth. Oh, daddy! - Is this your father? - Yes. Can you ride a horse? Are there any horses at your place on the Moon at all? There are some, but they're really weak weeds, we use them for plowing and hauling, you know? You no ones are quite practical beings. Tell me, what is it like with us on Earth? We must be intriguing. I am yet to see clearly, but to me everyone seems like they're fleeing. I may not be right at all, but wherever I look. People flee from things. - Everyone is fleeing? - Everyone. A no one like me, coming from afar, can see this particularly sharply. Sharper than you, mademoiselle. You must really be someone. Do you think there will be a war? So many people keep saying it. Perhaps that's why everyone is fleeing. I'm not one to say that; where I'm coming from, folks don't speak of war. Is your father a trainer? Yes, he trains one of Hungary's best teams. - The Simontornya Crew. - An enthusiastic fellow. German? The reason we speak German is that the help shouldn't understand us. We're Hungarians: we own this castle and the manor. I'm a countess, imagine that. A countess. And he is the old count. Go on, my apologies: I told father that you caught a cold and you need high altitude air. What for? Do it for his sake: he loves taking guests to high altitude air. He took up everyone present on the manor; don't reject him. Go on now! Tell me already where you're from: I made up all these sightseeing spots for you in vain so that you'd tell me your opinion, but I didn't find it out. On the Moon we people have no opinions at all: we know we're no ones. Am I supposed to ask it from the servants? I'd like to ask something, countess: I need to return to Budapest, kindly lend me the train fare. - We don't have cash here. - I'll send it back tomorrow! Ask it from the servants, isn't that customary? It is! Forgive me, sir, for disturbing you. The countess asked me to lend a few pengos in your name, sir. - Yes? - Do you know about this? He does. Come on, tell him that you do already! Yes. I know about it. In that case I'll ask you to send it to my name. Georg Matusek. Georg Matusek, sir. Here is your money. You can leave. I don't want it. Do you intend to go on (out? - I found out who you are. - Well, who am I? Georg knows everything always. What he told me about you is that... I should take care with you. Hear me? And when I asked Georg to tell my why, he said: you are dangerous because you are a peasant. - Did I just hurt you? - No. Then I'll tell you one more thing. Georg also claimed that someone like you is capable of killing us in the end. Is that true? Look at me. What kind of a person do you think I am? The enforcers are here. We have switched off the generator, sir. And the countess is also supposed to leave here as we'll bring all the dresses in here to save them from being seized. Mind the silverware. Georg. I'm begging you. You may leave. We tatted to pay some "straight tax" so they're seizing things. Do you know what straight tax is? - Will you give me the cash? - But you're not leaving yet, right? You must stay here and mustn't leave until you tell me what kind of a person do you see in me. You cannot leave until that. Moszkva square. Please mind the closing doors. Homeward? Uh huh. Can I join you? Who else is there? No one. - Which floor is yours? - The sixth. Let's go to the fifth, okay? We'll take the last one by foot. Do you always meet your dates in the metro? No. Do you know this tenant? Only my mother: an old man. Sometimes I hear typing, other than that they're quiet. - And you? - What about me? - Do you know him? - From some place. Come on then! Oh sweetie, aren't you asleep? Why don't you sleep? I just took a walk, just went for a tiny walk, mommy went to breath some fresh air. It is alright, my darling, the heat is on again: his father didn't take heat well either. - How do you cope with the heat? - I manage, my father less so. It's alright. I'm here, darling. - Where can I find the toilet? - To the right. Thanks. All right, don't cry, I won't ever leave again, you see this gentleman here: this nice man is here as well, calm down. He loves you too. Take it off your head at once! Look at the state of you! I thought I'd pay my father a visit. Well, perhaps he ain't alive anymore, huh? I'm overjoyed to see my son visiting me after years. The heat will be overbearing today. Why don't you come with me to the beach? We could spend this day together. I have business to do. - Who's that on the wall? - Someone. He used to be my lecturer. He died. I thought so. Legality is obsolete. Productivity is the new way that this century opened up before mankind: productivity and the conquest of new technological possibilities: mankind either learns to live by it, or dies by it. Make sure to mention that civil service is the most crucial question of 20th century mankind. Bring up the example that even the clothes the participants wear are products of civil service: technology and factories stand behind them. These clays the state not only wields power, it is obliged to take up other responsibilities as well. These are not political but technical tasks. We need to involve the country in the economic blood flow of the world, which proves to be a statewide task, not that of individuals. Hungarian civil service is incapacitated, left here from the last century; at this point elaborate: civil service is a major firm. It needs to be led by experts and technicians. Preparedness, human warmth, workmanship. A civil service expert survives everything. His sphere of action will eventually grow further. He is a leader without a political badge. Man is a worker. And this worker will get involved into the executive head ever more energetically. Preparedness, human warmth, workmanship. Efficiency. Yes. I regret that we couldn't uncover the percentage ratio, only as compared to the capital value. - Emphasize this with oblique. - Yes: I understand. Is there someone there? Professor! What do you want here? Who sent you here? I'm the one who was given the instructor position at the count by the Professor... What I mean to say is that I won't take it. At this time? What kind of a position? - How do you know that I'm here? - I just... Come right inside... We're done, professor, It's not yet complete, but here's the sketch of the linear repartition of the individual ownership groups. Especially the medium ratio ones, in the third row... Hmm, process these with maximum detail. We need more of it if we want it to be a precedent. Nagy's group is working on the urban development programme... Where to? You actually want to wander off right now?! No, pal, I can't allow that! You need to see what's going to happen here so that you'll justify me. You won't regret if you return, we won't ever forget this clay. Not one of us, you neither, sir! Good evening, professor, I didn't come on my own. His excellency the cultural minister is waiting in the car and he asks if he's come at a wrong time. Teleki? What does he want here? You brought Teleki here? He insisted to see the exhibition. We came to the agreement that he'll see it at the opening! That bastard will forbid the launch of the exhibition! How dare you talk about his excellency like that? Ten years, ten years' work! We're collecting the material for ten years! And then he just brings the cultural minister here in the last second! That count will swoon if he realizes what this is. He intends to open the exhibition, he wishes to see what he's supposed to talk about. We've already let this Teleki disciple enter... I just thought... - You don't know him! Teleki is... - Yes! Professor. Tell his excellency that he's come at the right time. He may kindly enter the building and decide if he greenlights the exhibition. Professor, don't you wish to descend and receive him? No! If he forbids it, you'll no longer set foot in here, Engel! Imre Torok! Was I right telling you that everyone will be present? Come here, we were working all night... Well, if you accept someone who just came in from prison... That doesn't matter! You too, come inside, don't stand there. Good evening to all. This is Jozsef Feher, he'll bring us data from a manor. We got him an instructor position so that he's able to conduct a survey on the field. The minister. Your excellency. Peter Engel, my disciple has informed me that you're prepared. So I've come. And with good intentions. Zoltan. Primarily I'm a scientist myself. being a politician comes second. Everyone here knows that in the last few days some areas that were taken from Hungary have been returned, and when we were in heated discussions regarding this, my geographical knowledge, my ethnical and township maps. in other words the scientific facts, proved to be decisive. Shall we listen to the scientists as well? I hope so. Well, let's see your facts, Zoltan. - Which way? - This way, if you will. You're seeing experts in here, your excellency. Experts in efficiency who knew that civil service is indebted to mankind. This workers are ever prepared to handle the country's civil service in the most workmanlike way. We are serving here, your excellency. We are serving the facts. To us, the country is a major firm of civil service, and we are its technicians. I would ask of you to speak of tomorrow's exhibition instead. In the first hall we'd display Hungary's land partitioning. The ration of manors and of feudal arrangements. This is the most detailed land ownership map, a simple glance will tell anyone about the consequences of manor rampancy. All this untenable situation. Besides it, this map surveys the ratio of poverty-stricken peasants. Serfs and small land owners: the dark shade indicates a ratio of higher than 70 percentage, showing what makes the country choke. The maps were prepared by my colleague Dr. lstvan Nagy and his group, in the process of many years of survey, based on objective and utterly unquestionable data. - In this agrarian country... - In our home. In our home... land ownership is still accumulated in the hands of a few; thus class struggle is bound to be sharp, as in societies like this, ownership types that would secure the transition from one class to another are not allowed to develop. ...medium and small manors: the counts... The counts? In a country of counts and barons large manors still count as 4 million 808 thousand 49 ratable acres. We've classified people according to occupational main groups. Independents, civil servants and attendant staff. Out of 9 million residents 6 millions are penniless. New that we're clone, may I show you the next hall's material? I can see what you're speculating about. Zoltan. Please, we're not speculating about anything. All of our data are precise and measured on the field. Your excellency, it'd be advisable if you'd elaborate on the material of our institute as well. - Our exhibition is joint after all. - You are right. - Where is my material? - Here, your excellency. "Excerpts from the history of the language border of the Hungarian northern uplands" - That would be in hall 6. - Yes. And the other 5 halls would be filled with the material from Professor Magyary. Your excellency, we have more material than that: on movable capital, on civil service, and the reform suggestions... We'll return to those. So in the end the exhibition will be held... Our generation was lucky to witness the beautiful old unmutilated Hungary... These people are not. Your Excellency! You have to give an answer. They're waiting for it. It's no wonder that radicalism is in vogue. You're bedazzled by it. Zoltan: you ride high on the vogue, technology... Are you courting the future? - Please, you could do it too. - Me? This future? Perhaps all of Europe will perish, with only Hungary to survive. We need no trauma here: we could stay out of the next war. Kindly tell us: will there be an exhibition? Well. I don't mind it. I will open it tomorrow. You don't need to see me out. Kisses. Good clay, uncle Jozsi. I've got no work for you new, perhaps next week. We're in order right new, no need to rearrange things. - Tomorrow? - We'll call you. Come on, you really believe that anyone still has a need for you? This used to be the institute. I'm off now, off to the beach. You're coming with me to Pista Nagy. The century has hit its pinnacle. This was the century of organization. Uh huh, and now it's gone. What comes now? Perhaps we could go out to the beach. - Imre Torok wrote me that... - Don't, you should just... He wrote that what's coming next is mankind leaving Earth. That's what you should organise next, right? Leaving it behind. And us? Where are we supposed to be going? - The statue of the unknown worker. - Very interesting! The lordlike friends of your count are in a fit, huh? - Who's that with him? - That one? Don't fear for Teleki, he prepared for this. We're worth more to him than all this motley crew. Go on, please, it's very intriguing. While this gentleman, your valet is present, I'm not willing to talk. He's my teaching assistant. I know. I know more about him than you do. In that case, Peter, I need to ask you to kindly leave us alone with these gentlemen. If this one was never placed here. land lease and industry would have sticked together. - Congratulations, dear no one! - You two? If you're curious, we came by the explicit request of my clear father. My dear father! Who wishes to become nouveau riche as a representative... He obliged us to visit your exhibition, as you're one of the exhibitors, right, clear master? Yes, he is one of them, dear count. In this case I feel compelled to congratulate. I can see that you've discovered who are responsible for the current state of the world. I am the one! Please forgive him. The poor soul thinks that you came to spy on us there. In order to obtain data from our manor. This is important. What is? The little Alex. - Count. - Count. - You really are a count, right? - I am many things. A tad too many things. - It's easy that way. - Easy? I hope you're still aware of the concept of call of duty. I trust you have no manors left: they went down with Transylvania. - A count without land. - That's right. Oh well. It's easy that way. I knew the other count. The one who also worked for the land lease officials. But that one had lands, and he was free to partition his own too: that is fair! But this one? Is it fair? - And the people? - The two of us are having a talk... Two of us! - Do you seriously think these are true arguments? - Leave it! Only I know what this is. You want to become destiny, huh? And you're the funniest one! You people will be easy to herd into a mass! That's your professor, huh? Dictators, industrial saviours... Technicians, specialized bosses. Two of you yanking a third one! And you're yanking him right from birth! Please do understand. Understand if you're able to. Master... - When will we start my lecturing? - I will keep you updated. Just don't rush it... Yes, mylady. Quit yanking me! Leave me alone! My excellency, you appear to be tired. Shall we leave? Yes. Please make the arrangements. I'm not willing to believe it... Oh, he's coming... Your excellency, please... Your excellency, it is my privilege to introduce you... Won't you introduce me to your American professor friend, Zoltan? He's already gone. And what about your bolshevik colleagues from Moscow? If I was informed well, you used to do a book reading trip there. Your excellency, I don't know in how many countries did I hold readings, but I brought home my experiences from each of them... And I suppose you've also conveyed your experiences to others. - I'm a scientist! - So am II You're a politician too, and a count to boot. I believe you're the one who practices politics with greater flair. I know your work! But not you. You declined more than one leading positions! Because I was powerless there. Just like me right now in the ministry, as you think, correct? What would this country become if everyone would decline positions? A desert! A took the responsibility involved: and I'm not edging out of the things even now, and for your information... Come again? I am taking responsibility for this exhibition as well! Your excellency... Quite soon you'll become the prime minister. - How do you know? - Everyone's talking about it. Being a prime minister, you'll be obliged to support us in that we create the experimental plants in Komarom county! We don't have that kind of a connection between us, don't you sense? This is more important than our connection! - What makes you so tenacious? - This is important! Experimental plants... I cannot make up my mind if you're a bolshevik or a Nazi! Professor, please! I saw everything here and now I see things clearly. - And... our family is peasant and... - Please. I can see very clearly that this is not how we're supposed to be living and I... - Please... - How may I help the professor? - Another time, please. another time! - I'll do everything, anything, I... I will draw sketches. I'll survey. I'll work as a courier... I'll become an excellent student... I'd like to become the Professor's disciple! My sweet boys! This sweet professor standing in front of you is Dr. Akos Nadanyi, and he'll commence his first seminar with a question. Have you seen the exhibition? I mean the exhibition that was held next to our university in the Karolyi Palace; and it serves as a sweet example to illustrate what a university is and what it is not! University is a church, sweet sirs! And science is... well, what is it? Sanctity! That makes university independent and free from sweet state authority! This fact is abused by one of our professors. The sweet doctor Zoltan Magyary. when he erects an institute here Let me ask this: why won't this institute leave this place? Because it would be beaten to death, sweet sire! Hereby I urge you freshmen to join me in a prayer. Sweet and sacred science! Let the state build or not build factories, bridges, kindergartens. Let others electrify and arm themselves, let them organise our lives, let civil service be present from the wise ones. in the form of a state-run midwife, right till we hit our coffins, marked by the name of the Undertaking Authority! Just make sure that you, sacred science, guard your independence! Is there such a sweet person here who's already recruited into this institute? Thank you. Wait to see till you're in your fourth year... The professor will take all the straight A students there: he's making the executive branch of the future state! Sweet sirs... Now what? Do we need to leave? I am part of that institute. So you need to leave, sweet sir? Well, go ahead then! I hereby have the exhibition closed and be advised that the fault is not to be found in the exhibited material; I would've been able to create an exhibition from the same material that would satisfy me in each and every regard: but you insisted on categorizations. What I've always taught is that this is what you should avoid: this doesn't work as social education, this has nothing to do with Saint Stephen's perspective. What I want is that we Hungarians show everyone that, in view of the international situation, we are the dedicated organizers of this part of Europe. And we are unable to become such until our youth pursues radicalism! Some professors propagate matchbox society. And a matchbox society can in no way be nationalistic as it needs consumers instead Hungarians, but we need to preserve ourselves! Considering all this I am forced to switch back to count from scientist. And I hereby deny any spiritual community with the exhibition! I want these halls cleared by tomorrow! Dixi! Imre! Where are you going, Imre! From here? Back, back to the peasant life. You'll be a laughing stock at home with your books! I'll teach them to respect me; I'll tell them they're just playing with us! And the professor? Heck. Professor Magyary is just like the rest of the lords! He's shaking as he senses that he doesn't have much time left. There's no one to be found who knows what's up next! They're just playing! - Wait, you won't go away like this! - They're playing... Do you think you can escape so easily? Do you think they don't know? Then you tell me: what's up next? What are you gonna teach to the peasants at home? That you know the future? It's easy to depart like this, pal! First you tell me if you happen to know everything, come on! There's no one. There is no one here left to count on. You need to learn to be alone! That's the future. I'm not lying. And now you can return to them: play your games together as long as you can still do it! Imre, come on, jump off! You'll regret this! Keep in mind what I told you! You're alone. Jozsika! The rest is just a game. you fool! I told you! What are you saying, you dolt? You think they'll listen to you there? You'll learn it yourself, until that point you're allowed to play! Imre Torok is in America... He just wrote me a letter that he's going to die. He wrote: I am a Hungarian in New York for thirty years. And if I open my mouth. cancer is coming out of it. If I close my eyes. all I see is cancer: we expect my death by next week; see you. How does your heart fare, does it still skip a beat for organizing the masses? Do you still want to herd the people into a pen until a heart attack takes you away? He wrote... Well, we have a sweet situation, don't we? Our sweet Europe went crazy and intends to take the world clown with herself: and our Hungarian home feels like going into hiding in shame: however her sweet inciters won't let her keep quiet! They close clown the exhibition, huh? And we still won't skulk between two sweet great powers. Instead we double our troubles! Professor Magyary invites an imperial German professor to give a presentation! That's not what he wanted! It was the sweet Hungarian home affairs minister who commanded him thus, right? That's the price you pay so that Magyary can create towns out of villages! That's how he obtains the home affairs minister's permit, huh? Tate, Greater Budapest, then... lam. It is my privilege to introduce our guest, state secretary Mr. Stuckart. He is visiting Hungary as a guest of the home affairs minister. And he was kind enough to accept the timely invitation of our institute to hold a presentation on the imperial civil service. - Professor, please. - Where have you been, Nagy? I told you that under any circumstances everyone should be here... Professor. Teleki committed suicide. Are you sure about that? Entirely sure. Last night. with a revolver. Professor, What's this, was he murdered? Just tell me the facts, please. What happened? Count Teleki, the prime minister of Hungary, killed himself. I'm sure he knew something that we don't. We are going to enter the war... We are" We have attacked the Serbs... Please leave here. I'd like to be alone for a while. Everyone's relieved, the whole family, since he has now calmed down. - He's not drinking at all. - Then what is he doing? What again?... Imagine, he almost married. But his doctors told him that he cannot have children. Then he said: thank God, at least he doesn't need to marry. Right now he wants to give a Christmas present to daddy. We have all gave him presents already, but he's not done yet. The poor soul is in a big hurry. Please don't disturb him for long. This present is crucial for him. The last time we met, you know, on your exhibition, when was that? - Five years ago. - Indeed? Well, it was certainly before the war. Back then. I'm sure you thought of the two of us that we're unfortunate souls. That the two of us together is a mismatch, right? Right. Did you think of the word: failure? Yes, I thought of it, but not any longer. Not to that degree anyway. Strange: the same word crossed our minds back then regarding you and your friends. And now that I spotted you in a military uniform that makes you appear just like the others. The same word crossed my mind. Anger that ended in failure: this is what I thought. Master, this is the first time you come at a bad time. I can hardly recognise you with that moustache. Your shaven face was indefinite. Caesar and butler both, a slave and a terrorist together. But you're right: your moustache fits this tumult. - Shall we commence our lesson? - Are you still rushing, master? Just keep working, since work is everything, right? So is decay. The triumph of the democratic movement: work. - Are you good workers, tell me? - We strive to be. Then I won't hold you up. Make haste, you too. Tell me, master: what were we supposed to study together? - Economy. - Hmm. I will keep you updated. This card. whatever you draw on it... Whatever you do... You never entered a pawn shop, huh? An uppity peasant. - Do you feel sick? - This heat is too much. - Your heart's misbehaving? - Aah. Aah what? - Just... - Just what? Nothing will ever become of you. Sure will, you'll teach me. You'll teach me all clay, right? I just wanted to show you someone. Who, Pista Nagy? But let's go out to the beach afterwards. Afterwards. - What are you handing in? - A wristwatch, what else? - How are you supposed to tell the time then? - Kisses. I'm sure I'll manage. Pista Nagy is a big man, take caution of what you speak. I won't say a word. Kisses. Come on. - Look. it's Imre. - Haha, you came here? And I'm sure you intend to take the plans of the land lease, huh? You too, right, my Jozsika? And you wanna take the plans of the world! Why, do you have plans for that too? Sure I have; do you think I wasn't aware that you're a commie? Professor, your glasses. Finally. They fell off. I never put them down. We're bound to become the expert advisers of the new government. Not of this government, but the next one. A government is needed at all times, so we are needed too. We shall hand in our material following the war. With civil service that stands above all else. - We are the people of the future! - Is that all? Than we can leave now. Nagy! We shall attach the neighboring settlements to the capital. Along with urban infrastructure and urban civil service. We have detailed plans! We shall transform this obsolete hub into a world city! Professor. I will no longer survey anything! The future needs an organisation. a party that can march through the war, and in the end announce itself! A leftist party! There is no left wing or right wing here! In Hungary the division line exists between aliens and non-aliens! The line exists between them! Quiet, gentlemen! Stay objective! Denounce me, go ahead! Nagy, you used to be my best disciple. We need a sample. - We shall carry on the survey. - We need a party! Nagy, soon enough your life will restart, whatever happens: and the sooner it restarts, the better. Three things will always be present: organisation, service of the living. And civil service. - Parties will perish! - Not mine! Nagy, I didn't know that you have an unperishable party. Pista Nagy, do you recognise me, or you don't want to be bothered? Jozsika! We completed the cities! You completed them: you took the plans from the professor. Those made you a city builder... We've completed everything. the cities, the people. Everything were created according to our plans. We knew the future. Here is my son. I wanted to show you to him. Ask your father who I was. I was the one who carried on. The professor said that efficiency is everything: we need to show results. We completed the entire world. You were born to this place. Take a look at the town: we foretold everything. - The professor committed a suicide. - Indeed. I know how he died. Others tell different stories. I don't care. Let's go to the beach, there's nothing else to do. - Where to, old man? - To bathe.
