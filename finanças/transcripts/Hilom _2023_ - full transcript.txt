Good morning, baby. Amie, will you marry me? Not like that. Okay. Will you marry me? - Good morning, Mom. - Good morning. You're up early. Has your date replied yet? I think he's ignoring me. He don't even show up in my dreams. This is why I keep asking you for a grandchild. So I have someone to keep me company. Mom, leave that to me. Be patient. You know me, I want everything to be well planned out. To be sure. Am I right? Hang on. Looks like you're leaving early. You see… This is the day that I promised Dad. I'm so glad, son. But your dad is gone. Don't hug me too tightly or you'll wrinkle my shirt. Don't worry. Dad's giving us a hand, and he's watching over us for sure. Besides, you'll always have me and Amie. Thank you, son. I love you so much. I love you, Mom. I love you, too. I'll go ahead, mom. Be safe. Yes, mom. All right. Bye, Mom! Bye! Bye, Dad! Mommy Tere! Oh, Sam. You startled me. How are you? Just cooking. Mommy Tere. I brought something for you. A special treat. You've always been a sweet one. - Oh, double patty. - Open it. That's reserved for special occasions, isn't it? You know me so well. What do you think? Do I look good, mom? Babe. What's up? You're here early. Good morning, babe. By the way, I'll come fetch you after your photoshoot. The boss is having a party, and he's requiring us to bring a partner. But it's not till tonight. Really? Sure. I also wanted to tell you something. What is it? It can wait. It's not that important. Ah, okay. That was a long drive. Why does the place look empty? I wanted to tell you something before everyone else arrives. Look. Two weeks ago, Dad told me something before he passed away. To live my life to the fullest. Marry the girl I love and enjoy every moment together. So now, I will fulfill my promise to him. Amie, will you marry me? Say yes, Amie! Yes! Yes! Yes! She said yes, Auntie. He's putting the ring on now, Auntie. - Oh my God. - She said yes. Auntie, you're breaking up. Auntie, you're having a grandchild! Oh my god! There's something I want to tell you. Hello, Auntie? I haven't told him yet. He kissed me before I could say anything. It's up to you. Do you want to rot in the Philippines like your mother? She had no ambitions for herself. You'd be passing up a good opportunity here in Canada if you stay. Do you think your boyfriend can give you a life of luxury? I'll think about it, Auntie. I'll just call you later. I'll update you. You're leaving? Let me explain. Explain? You're making plans without me? My aunt got me into a modeling agency. In Canada. I got accepted. You have a modeling career here. You're earning, Amie. Besides, when we're married, I can provide for you. And for our future children. But I want to go after my dreams. I still want to prove myself. But you said yes to me earlier. Was that for nothing? What about our wedding? We can still get married. Come with me to Canada. Do you hear yourself? What about my mom? I can't just leave my mother. Come on, Amie. You know that. Dad just passed away. Besides, that's not in my plans. You know me, Amie. I don't rush into things unplanned. Your aunt's getting into your head again. This would even cross your mind, if you didn't talk to her. It's not like that. What do you mean? Your Aunt Dalisay just doesn't like me. Remember what happened at your granny's wake? I was seated in front. You know what she did? She asked me to leave. She said, "Could you step out? This is for family." Damn it, Amie! We've been together for years! But I'm still not part of that family? That's enough. This isn't about my aunt anymore. This is about my dream. You know what your problem is? You're too safe! You are too emotional! How can I tell you my plans when you get like this? There are so many more things I want to do with my life. But I can't do any of them because you keep stopping me. Because you think it's not safe! That I'm just impulsive! You're too easy-going. Should I just surrender everything to you, including my life? Did you ever ask for my opinion? I want to see more of the world. I still want to discover the opportunities waiting for me. Wow. You want to see the world without me. Yes. Even without you. Let's forget about your plans. After all, you never gave me a say in them. Did you ever stop to ask what I wanted? You never did. Go do them yourself since they're all about what you want. What now? What are we going to do? My son hasn't left his room in almost a week. What do we do now? He's ignoring me, too, Auntie. I've been calling him several times. What if-- Sam's already dead? Hey! Don't say that! What the heck are you saying? That's our friend, you lunatic! You forgot to feed your one brain cell. But you know what, we can't discount the possibility that… Sam must be dead! Aunt Tessa… Never say that again. Never-- Promise you'll never say that! Oh, son. Why are you all here? Let's go get some drinks. Drinks? Are you going to leave me, too? Toto, Bambam, what the hell? Yeah, yeah, let's do it. Auntie? We're game. Sam! Sam! For the snacks, I'd like some-- Sam lives! Ugh, my back. Well, you've been on and off for years. I'm sure you guys will make up. Problem is, she's leaving for Canada. You've got nothing on Canadians. In particular, Canadian sausages are large. Shut the hell up, Toto. What are you even saying? Whatever. You'll get through this, Sam. Whatever you're going through right now, it'll pass. To be honest, I know plenty of our friends who got left behind and they survived. What you need to prepare for, buddy, are the five stages of grief. I want to hear this. You're really smart. Who knew we were seatmates on row four in grade school? Row four? You were on row eight, idiot. Was that row eight? Who was the fat one next to me then? Careful. First things first, denial. This is the stage where it's hard to accept what's going on. That you guys are over. I think Amie was just forced by her Aunt Dalisay. Amie can't live without me. It's true! She's helpless without me. She's absolutely helpless. I'm the one who writes her resume. She's broken up with me so many times when her screws come loose. I swear! But she always comes back. She'll come back! Secondly, dude. Anger. This is the stage where anger just grips you, man. You want to pick a fight with everyone! You want to punch everyone, man! And your chest feels so heavy. Damn you! I hope karma gets you! Third, bargaining. This is the stage where you tell yourself you're willing to adjust for the other person. Amie... I can change for you. I'll endure everything. I'll stop talking about your Aunt Dalisay. Please. And I'll stop being boring. But I can't go to Canada and leave mom. I hope that part you understand. Fourth stage is depression, man. This is when it feels like nothing is ever going your way. You lose your appetite. You're restless. Everything in your life feels wrong. I can't take this anymore, man. I wish I was dead. I'm not a bad person to be punished like this. I put up with everything her relatives ever said to me. Just for her to leave me like this. Finally, acceptance. You never know when this stage will come. You just need to tough it out or you'll have a hard time. I can't let this happen. I can't just let her break us up like this. I'm going to see Amie. No, don't stop me-- Mommy Tere! I've missed you! Oh, Sam! Sam, come here. Have you been drinking? What are you doing here? Well, I missed you! Mom, I'm sorry I couldn't bring your favorite burger. No, it's okay. Why'd you let your friend get wasted? No. - And did you drive here? That's dangerous. - Yes, ma'am. You're drunk and you went out driving. Jesus, Sam. Mom, is Amie there? Amie! Louder! She didn't hear you. What are you doing here? Why do you look like that? Are you drunk? That's why you've been ignoring me. You got yourself a new chauffer. Bro, I don't want any trouble. You don't want trouble? Sam. Sam. Wait, wait-- - Hey! Sam! Stop that! - What? Shithead! - What the hell! - Enough! Amie! I gave you everything! - You got me wrapped around your finger! - Hold on, Sam-- I was always there for you! But now you just-- You're just gonna replace me with this asshole? That's enough, Sam. I thought you were on my side? Why would I be on your side? You hurt Andrew. He's my sister's husband's nephew! Did you know that? Get away from him. My sister called him so he could drive Amie to the airport. Listen to me. You know I like you for Amie, but... don't think I approve of what she's doing. Leaving for Canada. Like you, even I didn't know about it. But because I love my daughter, I will support her. I am so disappointed in you. Are you hurt? Amie. Amie, forgive me. We're done, Sam! Let's go. Amie! Amie! That's enough, Sam. Let's go home. - Let them be. - He was the nephew. Sam. Mom, why did you put away my pictures with Amie? Because the more you look at those pictures, you'll just keep hurting. Please don't make decisions for me, Mom. Let me do it in my own time. But-- Son… I've been calling you. Our budget is on hold because of you. What's the matter with you? This is so unprofessional. Your girlfriend probably left you because of your attitude! You are so irresponsible. I resign. Your girlfriend probably left you because of your attitude! I am so disappointed in you. We're done, Sam! Son. What is happening to you? I wonder if Amie knows I'm in the hospital. Don't think about that for now. Take care of yourself first. Pull yourself together, son. Amie doesn't seem to care about me anymore, Mom. When I die, will she come to my wake? I wish I had just died. Maybe then she'd care about me. All right, fine. If you want to die, I won't stop you. But remember this, it kills me everyday seeing you this way. Sam, I know you're hurting, but I feel much worse. Sorry, Mom. But I can't bear the pain much longer. I don't want you to worry, mom, but my heart is in so much pain. Son, remember this, your mom is here. I'm here for you. You can cry to me, you can cry in my arms, you don't have to carry all that burden, son. I'm here for you. I'll never ever leave you. I love you very much. Son. You know, Amie, I love you so much. I miss the times we used to date. I would get really excited. I hope you know how much I love you. Bro, how's it going? Here, drink this. What's this pill for? Just drink it. It's good. I got that all the way from Quiapo from an elderly woman. Folks there said she was even featured on television. The old woman said it's for people whose hearts were broken. Drink it and all your pain will fade away. - It's perfect for you. - Just like that? Just like that, man. Try it because I wanna know if it's effective, too. It cost you a lot, too. It cost me? It cost you. - You bought it. - What do you mean I bought it? You make it sound like I stole from you. Here's the receipt. Look how expensive that is, man. What the heck, Kempoy? Twenty thousand? For this? Yes! How did that happen? Look, man. Do you know what it's made of? That's made of mermaid fat. A praying mantis' eyelashes. A newborn baby's hair and ants' sweat, man. Just drink it. It looks real, right? Kempoy. You should have told me before you paid for it. And you really used my money? Yep. You'll pay me back, yeah? I'll need to pay my electricity bill with it. Come on, I'm just helping you out. This is too much, Kempoy. Because it's rare. I swear it's safe. I swear to God, Kempoy. If I die-- Mark this date. April 1 is when I die. I hope your conscience never lets you sleep. Hey, that's awful. That's just mean. - Go ahead. - Fine. Give me your bank details. All right. This is so expensive. Goddamnit, Kempoy. Three... what was it? Three-five-seven... There you go, man. Nice doing business with you, Sam. Thank you. Go on, get out. You're kicking me out? Your mom cooked so much food. Let me just grab a few bites. Cool? No? Fine, I’m leaving. I'll just wrap 'em to go. Bye! Twenty thousand? Hey, sweetie. I cooked all your favorite food. Sit down. I just need to buy something from the store, Mom. Huh? I'll eat when I get back. Go! Get in! Come on! Come on! Hey! Hey! Where are you going? Why are you shouting? You shouted first! This is your fault! Why me?! You shouted first! Just cover your face again. Just settle down. Stay here. Calm down, dude. We're just trying to find a way to cheer you up. Wait, I'm confused! What's going on? We're going to the beach! Yes! Right! Do you have money for this? Don't worry, my friend. We got you! The 20k you gave Kempoy, this is where it's going! This is it! We're your friends. We're here to help you. But that's all we can do--help. We can't afford any of this. That's why we thought we'd scam you. Sorry! Sorry, bro. Wait, what about the pill you gave me? Ah, that's nothing. I just found that above the fridge. That's so cool! Don't be mad. Don't be mad. You'll enjoy it, I promise. Wait, stop. I can't just go. I didn't tell my mom. Dude, that's fine. Your mom packed an overnight bag for you. She knows about our plan. Your things are in the back. See? Everything's ready. As for you, man. You still have a choice. You can get off the van. So will you, or won't you? Going down? Nah, I'm good. - You sure? - I'm good. Final answer? Let's go! Keep it up! Let's go! You idiots! You brought me to the place where I proposed?! Dude, that's exactly why we brought you here. To erase the bad memories, you have of this place. Okay? We'll just make new memories. We'll party, we'll hit on girls, we'll take the party everywhere. No more sulking in your bedroom. You okay? What's that? Dude, what are you doing? The party hasn't even started yet and you're throwing up. Get it all out, man. Keep it up. You'll be throwing up harder at the party. Let's just go to the coffee bar so Sam can wake up. Yeah. It's beautiful here! I think it's over there. What's up, Sammylicious! The gossip is true. Their cakes are delicious and look at this unique set-up. Coffee bar by the beach. After partying all night, go straight here come morning. Iced coffee for Sam. Thanks, man. Miss, are you okay? This is mine. Why are you taking it? Excuse me, are you Sam? Yes, that's my name. And I ordered an iced coffee. Boss, the heck is this? My head hurts. What's up with this? Hey, mister. You think you're the only Sam in the world? Ask the barista, I put Sam because my name is Sammy! Sammy? Yeah, why? It says 'Sam' on this. So it's mine. - I think she's eyeing Sam. - What are you looking at? - She's smiling. - The one in white. Sam, the girls have been eyeing you all night. Your sex appeal is off the charts. I hope I become a chick magnet when I'm heartbroken, too. Me, too. Aren't you a chick magnet already? Hi, boys. Hello, girls. Hi, girls. What's up, girls? You wanna-- Come on, join us. Let's have fun. You want to join us? These boys are cute, huh? That's different. That's different. You look like you're a lot of fun. But we don't want to hang out with Frogman. Frogman? Who is Frogman? - What Frogman? - You haven't heard? This is him. Hello, Sammylicious! Seriously, I had the most shocking experience. I ran into trouble with a very rude guy. I'm not going to namedrop but we'll just call him 'Frogman'. Watch this. Miss, are you okay? This is mine. Why are you taking it? Excuse me, are you Sam? Sammy should thank you. Because when I scrolled through her videos, only the one about yours went viral. She'll be famous because of you. You can see it, right? Thank you. Hey, what's up! Hi, miss. Oh, Sammylicious, right? I'm your fan. Come on, Come here! You'll have to forgive me. But your friend was really rude to me. I don't know how you can keep hanging out with him. How can you tolerate being with someone who has a bad attitude? You must have had a very lonely childhood. Really sad. You probably didn't have any real friends growing up. That's why you're still begging for attention. You have to act like a snowflake to be famous. - A freaking snowflake. - Wow, big word. Why, do you know me personally? You sound as if you know what you're talking about. Are you hearing this, you guys? Dude, can you hear yourself? I think you were the first one to judge. Right? How does it feel now to be judged by someone you don't know? Hm? Well, he didn't treat me well, did he? What did you want me to think? Sam is a good friend, okay? He just got hurt. Imagine losing your father then your fiancée breaks up with you. You have no right to be angry, all right? Or act all upset. No right. By the way, our friend is suicidal. We came here to have fun. So, he can breathe a little. Then this is what happens? He almost killed himself recently. Praise God nothing bad happened! We haven't seen him since last night. After he watched you humiliate him. If Sam dies, his mother will be left all alone. Then what are we waiting around for? Let's split up and find him! Let's go. You are pure nonsense! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Hurry up! Shit! To the other side! Sam. Sam! Sam! No! Don't do it! Sam! Don't! What's wrong with you? Are you stupid or something? You could have gotten us hurt. But you were gonna kill yourself! I just wanted to save you! Me? Kill myself? I just wanted to pee. Huh? Pee? Oh, I thought-- Well, I'm sorry. I guess I got carried away. You're not so perfect either. Blame your friends for telling me all sorts of things. Sorry for what I did. I will delete the video and post a public apology. Can you just leave me alone? You might do something drastic. I'm not going to do anything. I just want to get away from stresses like you. Because you don't know the feeling of being left behind. That's why you don’t understand why I want to be left alone. I have also been left behind. My Chinese ex-boyfriend left me. He didn't even introduce me to his parents. Because I'm not Chinese. So don't tell that I don't know the pain you're going through. In fact-- I see myself in you back then. Destructive. When you feel so down, you wish you could just disappear. When you feel there are way worse people who deserve to be in pain but why is it you that's being punished? You just want to self-destruct to get it over with. Don't worry. I'll help you. You're lucky, you met me. See you later at the beach bar. Lunch time. Your treat. Maybe eat a little slower. You don't seem all that hungry. I'm all right. It's your treat so I'm just making the most of it. Besides, I almost died saving you earlier. I deserve this. Don't go judging me. Wait, uh-- You said you could help me? Are you a therapist, or a love guru or something? From your videos, you're more like a food vlogger. Excuse me. I used to be a flight attendant. Now, I'm a full-time food vlogger and photographer. I've been wanting to do this for a long time. My stupid ex just stopped me. So... How can you help me? When I was crushed, I remembered what my dad told me. When he and my mom split up, he made a list to help him move on. I also made my own list. Was it effective? After doing everything on my list, he doesn't even matter to me. He can't touch this face. Are you saying I should just follow your list? Mm, no, actually. Your situation is worse than mine. Let's change it up a bit. You'll list Lucky 9 ways to move on. Wait, you have a list ready? Wait, hold on. You don't even know anything about me. Besides, how would you know it's effective? I already talked to your friends! That's why I told you to meet at lunch, right? Why did you ask them? This is my problem. You should have asked me. You know, Sam, people with love problems are blinded. That's why I asked them. All right, fine. You win. This is amazing. Your name and your ex's name, when combined... …equals my name! Sammy. Kinda feels like Destiny, huh? Sammy here! We're going somewhere at 1pm! Bring lots of cash! We'll buy drugs! Hey. What are we doing here? We're not pulling off something illegal, are we? The hell are you saying? Are you serious? Well, you said to bring lots of money. Aren't we gonna buy drugs? I swear you can't take a joke. Loosen up a little. Number one on your Lucky 9 list, shopping spree. Do some shopping. Doing this increases your self-worth. At the same time, it helps remind yourself that you are worthy of admiration. Game? Let's go. Change it. It's ugly. Nope. It really doesn't suit you at all. - I swear, it's not working. - What about this? You've got zero fashion sense, huh? Did Amie never give you advice or buy you clothes? Isn't she a model? Doesn't she try to dress you up? It's not that. She helps me shop for my clothes, but I don't want her to. I just think they're a waste of money. Besides, I was preparing for our wedding, so I didn't want to spend on anything else. You do love her very much. You even left your swimming team in college for her. My friends told you that, too? Those assholes. Amie needed me by her side at that time. So I quit the swimming team. She had family problems. And she neglected her studies. Of course, when you love the person… You'll help them recover from the subjects they failed. You know what, you're such an idiot. You gave up once in a lifetime experiences. That's because I thought Amie was the once in a lifetime girl for me. What about you? Have you ever been a fool in love? Have you given up something for the one you love? Ah, I'm leaving. I forgot about another appointment. I'll just text you my address and then bring all of our clothes there. And bring a bouquet of flowers, too. Bye! Is anybody home? Sammy? How are you? Hold my hand. Then smile. Hold up the bouquet nicely. Like you're giving it to me. There! Perfect. Did you bring the clothes we bought? Yes, they're in my car. Should I go get them? Bring them in. Let's go inside. Come on! Let's go? Feel at home. Are you surprised? Number two on your Lucky 9 list is social media flex. Flexing to the world the new and improved you. Also showing to your ex that you're okay. That it's not your loss but hers. So you mean, I'll take a picture and then I'll post it? Exactly! I'll photograph you here in my setup with your new clothes. Then later, while you're driving, pretend you're happy while you're holding hands with a girl. Then every area here inside the house. That sounds like a lot of effort. Who's this? Ah, him. That's my ex. You must still love him. No way. I wanna punch him. Then why haven't you put it away? I just haven't had the time. You can put it away now. I'll make you some coffee. I thought you were gonna make some coffee. Do you want to drink? Are you okay? You're so weak with the bottle. Hang on, I'm just editing your pictures. Don't sleep on me, all right? Or I'll vomit on you. Nah, my eyes just get sleepy when I drink. I'm still good, please. Your face is all red. There we go. It's in the folder I sent you. Upload those pictures, okay? I edited them nicely. Wow! Dude, you look so good here! Hang on. When you ex sees this, she'll swim from Canada to the Philippines for sure just to see you. Hang on. Yes! Wow, I look good! Screw her! She used to have me, now watch her beg. There we go! That's what I want to hear from you, Sam! There we go! - Cheers! - Cheers! Wait. Whoa, see. Damn. It's getting lots of comments and like. There, look. You should thank me. You've got a great photographer. You haven't even thanked me. Thank you! Look again. See? Looking good! She messaged me. Don't! Don't. Don't reply. Why not? Weren't we doing all this so she notices me? You idiot! We did all that to show her that you're doing well! If you reply and your ex sees it, she'll think she can just get you back easy. Then what's gonna happen? You see a little hope and you're back to bawling your eyes out. Damn you. You speak from experience. You know, in all of the eight years I was with my ex, One message from him and I'd fall apart again. One reply from him and all the pain he caused would fade away. He'd never post about me on his socials. Whenever we're out on a date, he wants us to wear a cap. Because his relatives might see us. And you know what else? I endured not going to Chinatown to eat meat buns because he can't risk someone seeing me. Wack, right? That fucking relationship. Hey! What? What's happening? Go home. I'll just text you where and when we'll meet again. I've got things to do for work. All right. I'll go ahead. Bye. She's taking forever. I'm out. Sam! Hey. What took you so long? There you are. I'm sorry. I just passed by some garbage. I had to put it where it belongs. That's pretty harsh. Wait, why are we here? Are we going to church? No, you're buying a pet. Huh? Why, don't you like pets? Well, I love pets, especially dogs. My dog died of old age. Why don't you get a new one? The thing is, Amie has an allergy to pets, so even if I wanted to, I couldn't. Well now, because of her, you're getting a new pet. How? On the third list of your Lucky 9 is be a pet parent. So you can feel that you are loved and someone needs you. You are important and they cannot live without you. Literally speaking. Also to make you feel that you are not alone and you have someone to rant to. I can get any pet? So I thought of getting a turtle, because they're like me, right? I may be slow, but I am moving forward. Like how I'm moving on now. Anyways. What will you name this turtle? Bantay. What do you think? Does Sammy still have feelings for her ex? Because I found a remembrance that she hasn't thrown away yet. I also saw him trying to win her back. So what do you think? You think she's still in love with him and will she take him back? Hey, Bantay! Don't get any ideas! I don't have feelings for Sammy, okay! I'm just concerned. Besides, I consider her a friend. You're wrong about that, Bantay! Absolutely wrong! I don't have feelings for Sammy! Besides, just because we're always together doesn't mean a damn thing. I'm just curious. All right, let's make a bet. Let's make a bet. I won't meet Sammy for a few days. Let's say… five days. Fine! If I break that deal, I'll get you a girlfriend. Deal? Deal. Son, are you waiting for a call? No, mom. Hmm… You're just staring at your phone. You haven't left the house for four days. Whereas these past few days, you're always going out. Mom, I just had things to attend to. Son, maybe you're thinking about me that's why you can't leave the house. Don't worry about me. Don't think about me, son. I noticed something about you. These past few days-- You seemed like you're in good spirits each time you'd go out. Your face really lights up! Besides, you're looking really well. Like you're taking good care of yourself. Just keep it up, son. Let me. Come on. Come in. The heck, Kempoy. What are we having, Aunt? Eat up. They're delicious. That's what I'm talking about! Sup, buddy? Sit down. - Aunt, this is all you cooked? - Help me with this. We just arrived and there's food! Wow! Get your own place mat. Thank you! - Help yourself. - No shrimp? You're shameless. These are so good. It's my first time eating food this good. That's all you're getting. Go on, eat. Aww, damn. Stop complaining. [chattering] Hey. Are you a new friend of my son? What's your name and where are you from? Sammy Delima, 25, Barangay Paltok, Quezon City, Metro Manila, Philippines! You're a funny one! You seem so chirpy! I love your energy! Ah, wait. What brings you here? Are you going out? I came here today… to tell you, that… I'm pregnant. Huh? Sam is the father. No! I'm against it! You can't be! - I'm sweating in panic! - You're the father. I can't take this. I can't. I'm kidding! I just wanted to make you all laugh. Aunt, I'm here to ask permission for Sam because I'm inviting him to attend a birthday party the day after tomorrow. Ahh… Birthday party? We never talked about that. How would you know? You haven't even looked at my texts and calls. Besides, this is fourth on your Lucky 9 list. Meet a new person. People you get along with and you can be friends with. So that's the reason. That's why you kept going out. And that's why my son's looking better and better! See? They notice how much you're changing. Right? Could you add 'to fall in love again' to the list? Because I want my son to fall for you. Because you seem very lovely, hija. And we'll get along just fine. - You're a winner, girl! - Dang. Oh, mom, if you only knew what we went through when we first met. It was so-- Mm, just eat, okay? Aren't you hungry? You're hungry. So hungry. Son, cater to her. - Have some water. -Serve her. They say pregnant women have big appetites. Thanks. - You okay? - Huh? Are you okay? Why do you seem nervous? I don't-- I don't know. I guess I'm nervous. I don't really go to these kinds of parties. It's my first time to meet new people. You know how jealous Amie could get. I just never had the chance to do these kinds of things. I just avoid them altogether. Just relax, okay? Promise, my friends are nice. Look, you didn't even fix your collar. There, see? You look good tonight. Are you ready? Let's go? They're waiting for us. Hey guys! Hi! - Hello! - Hi! Nice to see you. Besties! Are you ready? The VIP room is ready! Hi, bestie! You look fabulous! Hi! Joshua, by the way. It's my birthday today so welcome to my party! I'm also a dating guru vlogger so if you want to get an American girlfriend, hit me up. Ouchies! Give me a kiss. I thought you brought me my birthday present. It's Aecy, by the way. I'm a rockstar vlogger. Hello! I'm Athena. I'm a K-Pop vlogger. Roxy, by the way. The cosplayer of the gang! Nice to meet you. You guys are so much fun. You have so many interesting stories. Cheers! Of course. Sometimes it's your choice whether to be happy or sad. I believe problems are a normal part of life. So you should choose to be happy every day! Correct! True. My boyfriend left me two weeks ago but I still chose to enjoy life. He's out there being happy with someone else, and I'm gonna mope around? No way, man! No way. Did you hear that? Did you hear what she said? You were left, too, Sam? Or did you leave someone? She left me. I gave her everything, but she didn't choose me. There we go. That's the problem. You're giving them everything, you don't notice you're running out for yourself. You really got me there. Well, sure! You think just because we're gay we feel different? No matter what your gender is, we all feel the same when it comes to love. I am thankful that you understand me. Honestly, I really didn't want to say how I felt. Because I'm scared no one would understand. Come on, love is love! Everyone goes through that. Promise. Let's give Sam a hug! Right, let's give him a hug! Don't be sad! Group hug! Hey, don't be a killjoy. Dance with me! You know I'm not used to these kinds of things. You haven't been to a bar? You know Amie, she's worried I'll meet a lot of people. She thinks I'll cheat on her. You'll get used to it. You need to enjoy yourself. Number five, party until you drop. Enjoy and experience life, Sam. You have to make up for the lost chances to think about yourself because you were putting others first. Live, for once! Okay? Let's dance. Come here! Don't be shy! Where are his drinks? There we go. Sam, drink that to loosen your nerves. Yes! Picture! Happy birthday! Shot! Shot! Shot Wow! Best night ever! I should have done this many times. Screw Amie! Screw Amie! See? I told you. I'm really enjoying myself. So much. Screw Amie! Don't touch me. We need to talk. Everytime, I come see you, you're always partying. We're done, okay? Are you stupid? Besides, when your relatives see us here, you'll just blame me if they disown you. Goddamnit, Sam! Didn't I tell you, give me time? And you're with your weird friends again. Won't you stop vlogging? You're not even earning anything. Your views are so low! Just go back to being a flight attendant. Give me time? Look, I gave you eight years. You still need more time? Don't tell me what to do. I'm happy with what I'm doing now. At least I have the balls to gamble on the life I want. How about you? You don't, do you? What's this, babe? Something wrong? - "Babe"? - Yeah! Do you have a problem with that? My friends said you're messing with my girlfriend. Thanks. I really appreciate it. Which friends were you talking about earlier? Them. My friends. We already shared drinks earlier, didn't we? Them? But those are my friends. I'm their friend now, too. You don't have friends. They are my friends. - Is that so? - Yes. You have no friends here. You're too mean. Guys, we have to go now, don't we? Huh? I'm not done with my drink, bestie. No, we should go. Huh? Why? Well, come on then. It's yours. You can finish it. Bye! Bye. Bye, friends! Ouch! Why did you do that? It hurts! And how did you get in here? How could I not slap you? You had such a sly smile! Aunt let me in. She said you were batshit drunk. I'm sorry. I don't even know what happened last night. I have the worst headache. Here, I brought you soup. That will get rid of the hangover. What is it? Nothing. Your hair looked better last night. About last night… I'm really sorry for leaving you behind. But thank you for saving me from Lester. Yeah, sure. And I'm sorry about the… The kiss? You just did it to show off, right? Sure. Of course-- Yes. Besides, it doesn't mean anything. We were just drunk. That's right. Now I feel sorry. Huh? What's the matter? Because you didn't get to do the other item on the Lucky 9 list. But it's optional anyway. Wait… Anyway it's up to you. What was it? Number 6, one-nighter. Casual sex. For the longest time you were stick to one. Now, you are stick to no one. Try another dish. What?! I'll never do that! No way! My conscience can't handle that! Sex with no attachment? No way! Is that really how you see me? Besides, I can't stomach that. I wasn't raised that way so I won't do that. No way! Psst. Hi, there. I'm feeling lonely. Could you keep me company? Calm down. I was just asking. You could've just said 'no'. Simple. Well, then, I'm leaving. Wait. You just got here. What's your hurry? I have somewhere I gotta be. Uh-- Wait. I'll just text you the details of what we'll do in the next few days. What else is on the list? Also-- You won't insist on a one-night stand again, will you? I won't. I told you, it's optional. Ugh, you're too much. Amie made a mistake dumping you. There aren't a lot of men like you left. Are you okay? Hmm? I just have a headache. Just get ready, okay? Bye! You're getting a tattoo? Nope. So what are we doing here? Number 7, reminder. Get a mark that will remind you that you're special. I'm good with my tattoo. What does that mean? Nothing. I just felt like it. So today, you're going to get a tattoo that when you see it, it will remind you that you can do and overcome everything. Like this! Okay… Number 1. What does that mean? This reminds me to always put yourself first. This is the mark that tells me that you gave it your all, so this time, it's your turn. So think about what you're gonna get. All right. Why 'S'? Why 'S'? Because my savior's name begins with that letter. This 'S' will remind me to never give up. Because this 'S' never gave up on me. So I shouldn't give up on myself either. Are you serious? Yes! You're crazy. I'm serious. You're important to me, too. Looks okay, right? I approve. Nice. It's still pretty early. Actually, yeah. I don't have anything to do after this. But maybe I'll just edit my next vlog. Uh, Sammy-- Maybe you'd like to go on a date with me. Date? Yes. Friendly date. After all, we're always focused on the Lucky 9 list. Maybe this time-- We can both just take it easy. I guess. But it's your treat, okay? You're really fun to be with. I know I'm fun to be with. That's why my friends always invite me when they're having a party. They say I'm the life of the party. It doesn't hurt that they say I'm beautiful. You're so different from Amie. Amie's not a fan of grungy, urban stuff. Like the street food we ate. For her, it's dirty and smelly. Wow, she sounds snobbish. Is she made of gold? Want me to drown her? You look happy. That's a good sign. Just a little push, and you'll be fine. Ummm… Do you want to come in? Uhm, maybe not. So you can get some rest, too. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Why are you looking at me like that? You know, you're so malicious. Nothing weird happened. Just because I'm happy doesn't mean I'm in love. Can't I enjoy the company of a friend? Hey, listen. Just because you have a girlfriend, doesn't mean I should be in a relationship, too. You're full of it. You seeing something where there's nothing. I just had a great time. I just experienced and did the things I wanted to do with Amie. Stay there. I'll just text here. Thank you. It's been so long since I enjoyed myself. Good night, Sammy! Bantay. Did Sammy notice my text? She hasn't replied to me. How about-- Maybe I should greet her good morning. I noticed we did so many things yesterday. Maybe she got exhausted. That's why she's not replying. Maybe she can reply now. Good morning, have a nice day! Good morning! Morning. Son, I do appreciate that you woke up and cooked for me-- But how did this happen? This rice, this dish-- It's burnt! Looks like you served us charcoal, son. My, my. Son. Mom. Something's bothering you. You're waiting for something. Mom, I'm not thinking or waiting for anything. Hello? Sammy! Sorry? I won? 800 thousand? Huh? What foundation? Oh, no. No, you have the wrong number. Son, I can see right through you. You're not waiting for a call, are you? I'll get it. Oh, your friends are here! Nothing beats the food here! Eat up. Go on. Sit down. Oh, you know, we had some snacks just now. Huh? He cooked this for us. You did so good! Extra crispy. Taste it! Cross over, man. Do it again! Do it again. Wow. Again. One more. I'm dizzy, bro. You're just pulling his leg. You're such an asshole. Sam, were you listening to my-- Hey. You've been staring at your phone! You'll melt your brain. That's radiation! I was just thinking. What is it now? I thought you've kind of gotten over Amie? Yeah. No, uh-- It's just-- Nah, it's different. No, I think it's-- Say for example. Something good happened with a new friend even if you just met. What should I make of that? Should you just forget about it, like it means nothing? Whoa, like he can forget all that. - I think you're falling. - Exactly. Right on. Hey, I'm not falling. It's written all over your face. Just admit it. Here's what we're gonna do. Let's pretend we didn't hear that. - Okay. - We don't know he's falling for her. We heard nothing. Cheers, guys. Cheers. That was just a little joke. That was a hell of a reaction! Oh, and you've got a big smile on you! But you don't answer my texts and calls. Sorry, I just-- We're leaving. Mm-hn. We're leaving. Come on! Hurry up. Get dressed. We will go hiking. Hiking? Yes. Hi, miss. 2 rooms reservation for Sammy Delima. Ma'am Sammy, only one room is reserved. How did that happen when I reserved two rooms? Maybe our system bugged, or your app. Okay. I'll just get another room. Okay, I'll check. We are fully booked now, ma'am. I'm sorry. What? How's that? What about us? Miss, we'll just get the one room. We'll just pay additional for pillows and a comforter. "Get the one room"? I'm tired. Somebody else might snatch the room. Let it go. All right, sir. We will get the room ready. Why are we going hiking? Don't ask too many questions. Let's go. Let's go to the room. I'm sleepy. Sammy… I just want to thank you for bringing me here. You know, when Dad was alive, we used to go on hikes. But when he passed away, I thought we'd never go on another hike. Thanks to you. Because of you, I can climb a mountain again. I can go for a hike. Let's just change the topic. Why didn't you reply to my good night last time? I mean, it's not a big deal. I was just wondering. You know, all my sadness dissipate when I'm with you. What about you? Do you have anything else to say? Are you okay? Worth it, right? They say nature has a unique property to heal everything that we're feeling. Physically and emotionally. That's why it's number eight on the Lucky 9 list. Hiking. Just shout it all out to the world, all the pain you feel. Once you do, all the weight will be lifted out of your chest. Why did that have to happen? Why did I have to lose my father? He was a good person. He shouldn't have died. You know, I rarely see my mother smile anymore. Almost never these days. For Aunt Dalisay, I did everything to get along with you, but you treated me like I'm not human! As for you, Amie, I did everything! But you chose to leave me. You're so selfish, Amie! Go for it! Shout it all out! You're so selfish, Amie! And to you, Aunt Dalisay, damn you! You took Amie from me, Aunt Dalisay! Screw you! Screw you, too! How have you been? We've been sitting here for a long time. You still won't talk to me. I want to fix what's between us. I want to apologize to you. I made a mistake, Sam. My job there wasn't easy either. It was tough without you by my side. Why are you apologizing? You wanted that, didn't you? It was your dream. Forgive me because I listened to my aunt. Forgive me because I focused on the fact that you didn't support my dream. Forgive me because I focused on your shortcomings instead of our love. Shortcomings? What if your career in Canada took off? You think you'll have seen your mistake? You'd hold that shortcoming against me for sure had your career in Canada taken off. I endured being alone for a long time. I felt like dying. You know, it's funny, I used to wonder what hurt more, when my father left me, or when you did. How did you meet Sam, hija? It was at a beach, ma'am. Just by accident. So you're a party girl, huh? You met Sam at a drinking party. Well, Sam doesn’t drink. You know, for sure, the two love birds have gotten back together at the top of the mountain. I know Sam's taste. He's into women who are decent and educated. He's not into stray cats like you. I'm sorry if I'm not up to your standards. I'm not the kind of woman you think I am. I have a good job and I'm happy with what I do. That's my payment for the coffee. The coffee that tastes as bad as your attitude. - How dare you! - I paid just enough for my share. I wouldn't assume you'd want me to pay for your coffee after you just insulted me. Have you seen Sammy? Ugh, come on. Stop looking for that rude girl. She ran off a while ago. How are you and Amie, by the way? How rude! Is it the feast of rascals today? Ah, miss. Yes, sir? Have you seen the girl I was with? No, sir. Sam. Is something wrong with me? People seem to find it easy to just throw me away. Don’t be dramatic. Your Aunt Dalisay said that you and Amie have made up. She said all those horrible things about me. So I just left. Or I'd have slapped her. I can't believe she said I was-- Whatever. No, wait-- What did she tell you? That there's something going on between us. Why? Does all this mean nothing to you? Am I the only one who feels something special between us? Are you out of your mind? You're gonna make me your re-bound girl? Are you okay? Remember this. There is a huge gap between being a lover and a confidant. We did this so you could move on, not so you could fall for me. This is all wrong, Sam. This is wrong. Because of that Lucky 9 list, I learned to move forward instead of move on. Yes, to move forward. Life goes on even though I've been hurt. It's painful but I have to accept it. Because in the end, we'll have learned something. Rather than moving on with baggage in my heart. We did this so you don't have to rely on others for your happiness. Last number on the list, Sam. The Lucky 9. Be your own happiness. Be happy even if you are alone. Your happiness should not depend on others. Be thankful, Sam. With what you have. I was able to be happy, even on my own. I learned to love and accept myself, appreciate myself, because of you. But just because we've been hurt too much, doesn't mean we should be content with being alone. It's true-- We must learn to love ourselves, but isn't it better if someone is looking out for you? When someone cares and loves us. Am I right? Life is better when someone gives you a reason to live. For the last time, I'll ask you this-- If you can't give me an answer, I'll leave. But if you say yes, I will never leave your side. Do you love me, too? Sammy? Bantay? Bantay? Mom, what am I doing here? Wait. Why am I here? I was on a hike. Where is Bantay? Where's Sammy? Son, what's going on? Who's Bantay? Who's Sammy? You know Sammy, Mom. Nope, I don't know anyone by that name. Son, I'm confused. Who are you talking about? Are you taking me to the beach? Are we going to the beach? Huh? Now? Dude, I just came from Quiapo for your medicine. Now you want to go on a beach trip? Hang on-- Are you okay? Is this an effect of the medicine? Son. Are you okay? Huh? Is anybody home? Yes, who is it? Is Sammy there? There is no Sammy here. Wow, Auntie Tessa. This is an impressive spread. It's delicious. Thank you. Just eat up, you three. Because if it wasn't for you, my son wouldn't feel better. Ah, Kempoy-- Yeah? Have you found the old person you bought the pill from? Damn, sorry about that, man. I've been sweeping Quiapo everyday but nobody's seen him since. Why? Is there a problem? Nothing. I just wanted to ask them something. Okay. I wanted to tell you guys something. Huh? I would like to go on vacation for a few weeks. That sounds good! It's a great idea. And we'd better go with you. Because the more, the merrier! Am I right? That's right. Road trip! I'm excited. I think it's better if I go by myself for now. With everything that's happened. There are things that I can't explain. It's hard to make sense of any of it. But don't worry. I'm okay, really. Promise. - Are you sure, son? - Absolutely. Do you promise? - I promise. - You promised. Oh, my dear. Group hug! Iced coffee, please. Your name, sir? Sam. Please wait, sir. Iced coffee for Sam. Thank you. Are you Sam? Bantay, is that you? Bantay, it's me! Excuse me. I'll just take my pet. Sorry, did he disturb you? Nope, it's okay. Sammy? Sam, I'm not Sammy. Ah, okay. I thought you were Sammy. So-- You know my name? Do you remember me? Huh? Yes. I'm Sally, remember? The chubby girl from freshman high school that you defended from a bully. Oh! Wait, wait! So you're Kempoy's cousin? Yes, that's me. You were always teasing me for being shy. Kempoy would always tease me because I had a crush on you. Sorry, I didn't recognize you. Well, you look good. - Thank you. - It's been a while. Wait, wait. We didn't have a good introduction. Can we have do-over? - Sure. - Okay. I'm Sam. And you are? Sally. Nice meeting you again. I heard you had a crush on me. And have you heard that I-- have a crush on you now?
