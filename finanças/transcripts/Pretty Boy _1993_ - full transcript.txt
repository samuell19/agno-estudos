Cocksucker! Maybe that'll teach you to pay up. Got the message? PRETTY BOY - Monica speaking... - Hi, Mom! Nick, where the hell are you? Don't come looking for me. Got the message? - Want some fun? - I'm having fun. - Need somewhere to sleep? - No, thanks. I've come to see Kenneth. Kenneth? Who might you be? Nick Marcussen. Kenneth said he lived here... Sorry, young man. He doesn't. Hey! I know Kenneth. Can I help you? I need somewhere to sleep. Come upstairs. We'll fix you up. Nick, wasn't it? Let me take your bag... - A towel for you, Nick. - Thanks. - Isn't anyone looking for you? - Mom wouldn't dare. Social services hate her. If they find out I've run away, they'll take my brothers. - They're always threatening to. - You're not an only child, then? No, I've got three brothers. Victor, Christopher and Martin. They call us the Dalton Brothers. Martin and Christopher are twins. What about your father? Never seen him. I once saw Victor's. My God! Martin and Christopher have never seen theirs. You don't miss your Dad? Not if he's like Victor's! Ever seen one of those before? That's the Compasses. That's Chameleon. And that star is Reticulum. Goodness! You're interested in stars! Real stars! Let me show you something... This is great! What's that just behind Reticulum? Let me see... - Where? - Slightly to the left. - The Clouds of Orion. - You're kidding! - Do they really look like that? - You know about them? - I read about them somewhere. - Where? - At school? - Are you crazy? I haven't been to school for a year now. Is that really where all the stars are born? Not all of them, but lots are born there. I'll turn it a bit... ...and show you one you won't know... Or do you? - Which one is that? - It's... Adonis. Adonis... No, I've never heard of it. One is extremely lucky ever to see it. - Let's find you a bed. - Where? Here. There? Why not? Yes, why not? I've often slept in my Mom's bed. What are you up to? - If you want German, you must... - Hey, I've only just bought those! No... no. If you want that boy, you must pay what he costs. What the hell's up with him? Who's that? - Who's what? - Down there? - Steen. He's hospitalized! - HIV? - AIDS. - AIDS? Poor guy. - Hey! That's... - Who? Ralph. The stargazer. With some stupid kid. - It's not our problem. - He's mine! - Do you mind? - Not after the beating he gave me. - Got a light? - Sorry, I don't smoke. Existential acid! The Doors! Is your name Jim, too? - Nick. - Pretty name, eh? Hi, Nick Prick, I'm Jan. Monsieur Nick Prick... Jean. He's an EC mutant. My name's Frantz. Are you a runaway? - How old are you? - 13. Not much! But even 13 year olds have to stick to the going rate. - Do you? - Or are you undercutting? - You took my john. - John? See that bloke? ...We call him the Fart King. Jan, make the Fart King an offer. Shit in his face and he'll pay you 200. We score from johns. What do you score from Ralph? He's just a nice bloke. Like a daddy, eh? Tight little buns like yours are our business. Swedish and Norwegian cost the same. Then there's Spanish, German, French and smacked booties. You know what German is? - I'm not so hot on German. - You'll learn. Everything has its price, pretty boy. Stick to it. Regards to Ralph from Jean... Choose one... I didn't mean it like that. I want to give you something. For services rendered. Choose! - You want me to leave? - Don't be silly. That's not what I meant. Just don't talk about prices. They're not important. You've got a bed and food to eat. So no more talk of prices. If you want to talk prices, we'll have to talk services. - Right, Nick? - Sorry. Forget it. It's time! Now! Hurry! No time for that! It only eclipses Chameleon for a few minutes. Ralph I Camilla speaking. Someone's stolen my handbag. Keys, money, passport. I'll try to get a plane tomorrow. Can't wait to see you! Not today, Nick. I've got an international conference going on. But you promised. I'll show you round the planetarium another day. Ralph! Wait! Bloody hell, Nick! Thanks for the meteorite! That's OK. See you. - Are there many? - Every single day. Between 500 and 5000 tons of them fall on our heads every day. Mostly as dust particles. The biggest is 60 tons. It's in Africa. I wouldn't mind finding one like that! Me neither! But it's not easy. No more than 24 of that size have ever been found. Hello Ralph, Mommy here. How are your tonsils? Don't forget our family get-together on Saturday. I haven't heard from dad. Never mind. Keep that throat warm, now! Tonsils! She's been after them as far back as I remember. Does your Mom worry about your tonsils? She's more worried about my confirmation. - Aren't you confirmed yet? - Not for another month. She's promised me a really big party. - Can I have my bath now? - Of course. Yes? What? Is that you? Just a minute! I'll come down... You must go... Out! Get out! Hurry! Where is your bag? - Get out! - My meteorite! To hell with your meteorite! ...Where is it? Never mind. Hurry up! - What is it now? - My fee. - Fee? - I'm not going till you've paid me. - That wasn't the deal. - Well, it is now. Or shall I use the front door? - Are you for hire? - Hop in. - Hi, Mom I Nick here. - Hi, Nick! Do you realize the time? How are you? Fine... are you in tonight? - Mom, are you there? - Yes. - I'll come home, then. - Not tonight, Nick. Can't you wait until tomorrow? - Do you know Renée? - What do you want? - Somewhere to sleep. - Don't bother. Stay here. Excuse me. Got a light? Hey! I've got an address for you... I'll write it on your hand. Kingo Rørvig? - The car dealer? - I am he. - I was sent by Poul. - The verger? - The consul. - Ah, the dear consul! Has he got over his mother's death yet? Want some fun? That's why I came. Come on. Yes? No, I don't think you do. He was completely new to me. Is your name Nick? ...Yes, his name's Nick. I think he's just up your street. You'll have to ask him. The sweetest spring chicken. OK. Bye! I'm on a business trip for the next two weeks. You can stay with him in the meantime. Yes? How expensive? Do one for a thousand. What would you like? Never mind. Just send her something. Go and get four Coca-Colas. Here! It's my turn! - Whose turn is it? - Mine! Mine! You go first. Move that Coke! Wanna watch a movie? Welcome home! How was your dad? - Dad? - Haven't you been to see him? - Been to see him? - That's what your Mom said. My Mom has a vivid imagination. - What's his name? - Frank. That's Victor's dad. Of course. Do drop in! My canary's laid an egg! Shut the games room door. Shut it! Thanks for the prezzies, Nick. And the flowers. They are gorgeous. And the cars... you gave the twins. They loved them! You came without phoning first. - All the way from "dad's". - What do you expect me to say? They keep asking, "Where's Nick?" You send presents and flowers. Where does the money come from? Back door jobs, Mom. At least I get paid for them. What do you get? - Answer me, you cow! - Cut it out. Tell me! What do you get? What do you get? Tell me! I'm not a whore and I never have been. What about your confirmation? The priest won't confirm you if you cut his classes. And the party... Aren't you coming, baby? Now for something completely different. Everyone here knows... - that astronomical navigation - is about fixing the position of a vessel or spacecraft... by measuring the altitude of celestial bodies. For this we need astronomical coordinates. I'll try and explain... how these coordinates can determine an object's position. The equatorial coordinate system... involves big circles and little circles. Is there anyone who can suggest... what we could use as the center of the coordinate system? - The eyes of the observer, Sir. - Quite right. Excuse me a moment... What more do you expect of me? It's not just that. Not for you. But for me that's all it is. I have no children, and don't want any. Surely you can see why I can't let you live with me. Surely! Where are you staying? Round and about. Do you need money? You should go back to your Mom's. No, I don't take whole estates. Not even for free. Find someone else. Goodbye, madam! Well, have you considered my proposal? Aren't you into fun? I'm not like that, as your new boyfriend knows. You can stay here till you find somewhere better. But I'm not having you in my bed. What do you say? - I don't have to do anything? - Sure. Phone home. Then arrange those glasses... by type and size. - Mom doesn't care. - I do. Go and phone her. Hello, lads! Goodness! Very nice! Well, Mister Thyco! Want it up? - May I? - It's your room. Where? - Are you OK in there? - Fine. Goodnight. There is a screw missing. You haven't got it? I don't know what it's worth. - When will Hartvig be back? - Late. Not till tonight. Shall we say... 500? I was thinking more of 2000. - I saw in a newspaper... - 700, including the case. - Hartvig wouldn't give you more. - No? You could wait and see... 700, not a nickel more. OK. Aren't you asleep? - This isn't hot, is it? - The receipts are there. Look! Fantastic, Nick! Wow! Have you got a passport? ...You'll need one. We must take this to the Frankfurt Toy Fair. What does that say? - 4731. - 4731... 1260 DM... The DM is worth 3.85... - That's nearly 5000! - For the locomotive alone! - You've got a nose for this! - I'll ring Mom and tell her! - Where did you get it, Renée? - None of your business. - First editions, all of them. - There'll be no agro? No way. Or can you see the headlines? "Cabinet Secretary pays his rent boys in first editions!" I know but I ain't tellin'. - How much? - The best price in town. Sure... Hi, Nick Prick! Are you sticking to the going rate? When did you become Uncle Hartvig's poodle? Nick works for me. Is that illegal, too? Get dressed, pretty boy! We're going up to town! That one. Get us two whiskies. Shit! The bastard! - We'll give him a freebie. - Nick! Nick, come on! That's the bastard! OK, party's over. Well done, Nick! Don't! - Are you his father? - No. His mother filled in the form. When will it be ready? In a week. We have to leave tonight! - I'll see what I can do. - Thanks. - Can't I just phone her? - Not when we're going away. Go and say goodbye to your Mom, and I'll shut up the shop. Buy her some flowers and give her my regards. Sorry. I don't dare. Of course you do. - Give us the money! - I don't want it. You don't want it? Did you hear that, lads? Why not? It's too hot. Please remove it. Now. Too hot? Did I hear you right? Your shop's full of the stuff! So what? Goodbye, lads. I'll get you for this. Hello, Nick! Run along, Mrs. Mortensen. Prepare Steen's room for Nick. - What about Steen? - He won't be back. - Nice to see you. - Hartvig's been taken in. Well, it was his own fault. How nice, Monsieur Prick Nick. Try this... Not your pansy outfits, Max! When's Jean off? You're all jealous... because all you ever do is turn tricks in parks. Heinrich Blom's got style. A fortnight in England... on the world's best golf links. Better than the public lavatories. What will little Jean do on Heinrich's black rubber sheets? - Use golf clubs? - Is he one of those? He was when I dropped him a year ago. You've got competition now. Nick can't play golf. Heinrich won't mind swapping golf clubs for a telescope. Supper time, boys. Nick, was it? - What's that? - Your favorite. Sausage and fries. Welcome to our little family! What's this? - The same as last time. - Too true. How disgusting! He's jerked off over them. Mrs. Mortensen! - You're disgusting! - Oh, dear! Disgusting! Lick them up, Mrs. Mortensen... What naughty boys! Lick them up, Mrs. Mortensen! You've forgotten your shorts again. Your eyes are everywhere. Fingers off, mate! Of course, you are a new boy. Isn't he a cutie? Where did you find him? They've discharged me. Great to see you all! Thanks so much for coming to see me. God, I'm starving. Mrs. Mortensen, get me a Coke! What's up? Aren't you pleased to see me? I was only kidding. I had loads of visitors. Old queens with bleeding hearts. Make us happy. Shove off. - I live here! - Find somewhere else. Your Afro disease is bad for business. - Shove off. - I can't. - Nick lives here now. - This place is mine, too! I paid my share! Your market value is below zero. We run an agency here. Find somewhere else. We're not an AIDS charity. This is a business. But with you here... Adieu, Steen! Don't show your face here again. Out! Supper time! Here... - Hurry, Nick! We've got a job. - Take care of them. There is money in that smell. To order... in someone's face? I just can't! Of course you can. Eat lots of cabbage. It keeps you in biogas. Jan knows the trick, and earns 200 a blast. You just blasted a thousand into thin air! Nick! Nick! Where are you? Come and look! Hurry! See that bright star? That's Jupiter! And see the faint dot behind it? No... - Yes, that's great! - It's Callisto. The furthest away is Io. Then comes... No, the Big Dipper is too boring. Renée, try and find Europa. To the left. Can you see it? They are the Galilean moons round Jupiter. - I can't see them. - Of course you can. Let's see... there. Come and look, Renée. Now I can see it. What's that to the right? Let me see. - That's one like you and me. - Control yourself! Do you know where this was born? - Sweden. - Sweden! Yes, during the last ice age. I've seen these before. Bigger ones. From Sweden. I suppose you're from Sweden, too. Who knows? You're looking at the place where all the stars are born. Almost all of them. And this, too. It's from the Clouds of Orion... Everything this consists of is in your body and mine. We wouldn't be here otherwise. I thought I was lacking something. Give it to me, now! Where it has put it…. OK, if you let me go first. Swedish meteorites! Take your eyes off my body. You heard! This was a bad mistake. Forget it. That's best for both of us. Forget it, and get dressed. We've got a date. I don't feel like it. What you like or don't like doesn't count. Or you can find somewhere else to live. "Feel like it!" Time to wash the floor. Lick! You've learned a trick or two. Lick! I want it nice and clean. Lick the screen, Mrs. Mortensen. - I hate those bastards. - That's only too obvious. - What now? - We'll quit for a while. My Mom's going on holiday. I've promised to mind her stall. Come and help me. Take a break! I mean it! I'm off. - Me, too. - Coming, Nick? You going back to Mommy, too? It's getting too uncool, Nick. - 4 cucumbers for 10. - 2 baskets of plums for 20. - 2 baskets of plums for 20. - 4 cucumbers for 10... I'm going for lunch. I'm ravenous, OK? Sure... Who's turn is it? Hello, Nick. Just a bag of apples. I've been looking for you. - I'll... - Never mind that. Thanks. Cheerio. - How the hell did you manage it? - I don't know. - It just broke. - It was brand new! They can do over 1 million km, but see what you do in 60 seconds! - Can you change an oil filter? - I think so. "Think so"! Let me see. Hi, Karl Erik! - What do you want? - To borrow a car. No racing, OK.? Not a VW! Come on! Not that one! Oh? Shall I go and call out for Mrs. Mortensen? When will you bring it back? - Why do you do it? - Why do you? It's not the same. What if you got found out? - What would you do? - If a john found out I was a girl? Yes. I'd have to find something else to do. A travel agency. I could marry into one. I just don't understand why you do it. Do you really want to hear what my social worker says? About the adolescent girl who refuses to become a woman? No, thanks. I hate red. Red makes me sick. Right or left? Um... Try right. Right? OK. There was a special kind of window. - Are you sure? - I recognize the place... - Aren't you a bit nervous? - I don't know. - Hi, Granny! - Granny? - Yes. It's Nick, Granny. - Hi, Granny! Nick? Just a moment. Goodness, you've grown, Nicholas! Help yourself. Is that you, too? What a cutie! My Mom tried stuffing me into a sailor suit once. I refused. So there are no fancy pics of me at home. Another? No, thanks. May I use the bathroom? Of course. Upstairs, second on the right. He looks very nice. - Who, Renée? - Yes. You look like a proper courting couple. Renée is a girl, Granny. Oh? I thought you'd turned into one of those people like on TV. You look smashing. Turn round! Just right for your confirmation. All you need are the shoes. - Do you do shoes? - Sure. What size? - 43. - Just a moment. OK, I'll tell him. ' Bye! Is there a mark here? - Did I do that? - Like heck, Tarzan! Were you over the moon? Yes, and completely weightless. Out, Karl Erik! That does it! I've had enough. This is too boring. You spend all your time in bed. Nobody spares a thought for me. Goodbye, boys. The last two weeks have been a waste of time. Ralph phoned for you again. - No way. I've got to go home. - Come on! - Renée speaking... - Ralph here. Is Nick in? - For the tenth time, no! - Do you know where he is? - What do you want him for? - He can move back in. Camilla has left me. Nicholas Markussen, may these words follow you all your life. Of faith, hope, and love, the greatest is love. "Defend, O Lord, this thy child with thy heavenly grace," "that he may continue thine forever" "and daily increase in thy holy Spirit more and more," "until he come unto thy everlasting kingdom. Amen." Nick... Nick, come out here! Damn it Nick! I can explain! Bloody hell, Nick! Run!
