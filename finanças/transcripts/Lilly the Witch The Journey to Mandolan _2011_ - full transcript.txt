Ah! I've got it! Take it down, quickly. "Dear Witch Lilly." "Come at once!" That's it. Easy peasy. Very good, sir. Such talent! I'm very talented. Stamp it and send it. Fast. Forgive me, but don't you want to add anything? - Anything… like what? - We've got a big problem. Our kingdom's throne is cursed and we need a counter spell. Yes, I like it! Write… You're a problem indeed. Because of you we have to call in a witch. Even A brash, this cheap sorcerer in a stinky caftan, is a useless bum. - It's ready, sir. - Huh! - Anything else? - Yes. - What? - Your signature. - Write your name with letters. - How dare you! I can write. Gu… li… man. This will take care of it in a jiffy. - Yes. - Exactly, in a jiffy. A letter! Leon, I've told you a million times… Whatever. LILLY "Dear Witch Lilly. Come at once. Big problem. Our throne has been cursed by an evil hand. We need a counter spell." Lilly! "Yours, Guliman, grand vizier of Mandolan." - Wow! - Lilly. - Play with Leon for a bit. - I'm just… Doing my homework. - You're reading the letter. - Shut up and buzz off. Come on, Lilly. You promised you'd play with him. - He can play with his friends. - I don't have any friends. I'm not surprised. Leon, that's not nice. You know the rule: one for all and one... …for Leon. He behaves like a two-year old. That's enough, Lilly. OK, but first I need to finish my math homework. OK. Thank you. "Joy. Anxiety. Fortune." Here. "Friends." "You want to have lots of friends?" "You want everyone to like you? Then, say…" "Amicum perplexum subitum." Hello. Can we play with Leon? We're his friends. Of course. Come in. Hello, we're your next-door friends. - Will you show us your room? - Yeah! Hi. Welcome to Mandolan, the Pearl of the East. "Mandolan is a fabulous country." "Subtropical climate, a huge desert…" - What? I have to go there? - Well… - The cuisine. - Oh! Our cuisine is the best in the world. For example, the gecko soup is delicious. Those fleshy eyes… Yes, Mandolan is a gourmand's paradise. Hector! We please every palate. Don't forget it. You can always call me with this scale. Magic book, page 157. Bring your hands up. Breathe from your core. Inhale. Exhale. Shaolin! What the dragon? Hello? Room service? This is Ms Surulunda. Please take the tray... Yes… The tray in my room to the garden. Room service. Madam. What is this? I didn't order anything. Oh, yes! I forgot. Sorry. - This is so funny. - Yes. We can do it again any time. Surulunda, I'm very itchy. Ouch! It's really itchy. - Red alert. The marzipan trick. - Oh, no! Excuse me. Pets are not allowed. This isn't a pet. It's marzipan. I've been a collector all my life. - Well… it moved. - Moved, you say? That's impossible. Young man, wipe your glasses. It stings! Ouch! It itches! Not anymore. Annoying mosquito. It wasn't a mosquito, Hector. It's the new super witch. - Super who? - She's not as old or tired as I am. And she's got the spell book. Lilly! Lilly needs me! I knew you'd remember. Bravo! OK! I'll go to her rescue. - Just concentrate on flying. - Flying? Me? You, of course. I'm retired. Where is he? Ouch! It stings again! Don't waste time. Go! Take care of yourself. And take care of Lilly. Have a nice trip! Here I come! Hector the Lord of the Sky! The Red Baron! The Green Dragon! Hector! Lilly! You're here. I've got lots to tell you. What do you think? I'm a bit suspicious, but… Let's keep calm and not do anything rash. We've a throne cursed by an evil hand, so there's only one option. Really? Which one? We have to rush to… nowhere. What? Why? Dear Lilly, you have no experience. Well… very little. Almost none. And a throne cursed by an evil hand… That's a mission for Surulunda. It's my mission. The letter is addressed to me. And Surulunda is retired. By the way, Mandolan is famous for its exquisite cuisine. I see! Very clearly! What are we waiting for? Let's do it. But first I'll write down some spells. OK, but remember. Write them down on a piece of paper and keep them always secret. Yes. And Witch Rule 1: "Never lose the note." "Capilli deliri actutum." - Awesome. It casts a spell on your hair. - Will it go away? - It's just… - What's up? Ms Lilly, Witch Rule 7.5, second paragraph: "Only utter a spell when you really want do magic." I wasn't. I was only reading "Capilli deliri actutum." - I told you. You can't. - I'm not so dumb. - "Cursed animal…" - I'm hungry. "Cursed door…" Here it is. "Against a cursed throne." OK. "A big problem. Our throne has been cursed by an evil hand." "Turn a big problem into a small one." Let's see… This one is perfect. Make good an evil hand. Hector? Where are you? - Would you like apple or orange juice? - Yes, please. How's everything? Great. - Where are you going? - I'll be back in a bit. You'll believe I've been gone a few minutes. I'm getting supplies. Maybe Mandolan cuisine is not so great. Get out! We have to jump before my mom... Jump? Now? But we can't! We need something from our destination and you have nothing. Yes, I've got the letter from Mandolan. Do you trust the post? - Alright. As you wish. - Ready. One, two, three, you can't see me! - Who's the handsomest of all? - Guliman! - Whose hand do they all want to kiss? - Guliman! - Whose foot do they all want to kiss? - Guliman! Where they all do what they must do Oh, Guliman! Oh, Guliman! Young lady, aren't you too young to be a terrorist? I'm Lilly. You're Guliman, right? You asked me to come. Here I am. I don't think she's the witch. You say you are Lilly, the super witch? You? "A hand doesn't like you Manis malum mutantis!" Would you like a tulip? A sunflower? - No, thank you. That's enough. - Yes. We were joking, right? Dear super witch Lilly, welcome to Mandolan. - Is that with you? - Yes. - And who are you? - I'm A brash, the sorcerer of Mandolan. He's Hector. - Thank you, Lilly. What a wonderful gift. - What? He loves roasted gecko. It's the national dish. He's not a gecko. He's my friend. And the best flying dragon in the world. - Nice and plump. - Hey, walking turban. Get your chubby hands off me. Are you… laughing at me, Leila? Mercy, my lord. Does anyone have any objections to the sentence, always fair, I'm about to pronounce? Very good. Take her to the gallows! Are you crazy? Let her go or look for someone else to help you. That's top secret. Thank you, super witch. Is there anything I can do for you? You're welcome. Don't forget Hector. Crisps, soda, foot bath, wing massage, stroking, chocolate… What are you looking at? Go! Well done, Lilly, don't let him bully you. And Hector, behave. It'll be a huge adventure, but they'll manage. Gee! Your king sits here? No… I mean, yes. He should. And… where is the king? Our good king Nandi was old and passed away. I didn't know, I'm sorry. Are you sad? You say you're grand vizier. What does that mean? A grand vizier is a very important person. Nothing works without him. A grand vizier is an official who assists the king. He's important but not… Forgive me. It's not what it seems. Knucklehead. He says he's a sorcerer but can't do magic. That's why I've got this damn problem with the throne. A sorcerer that can't do magic. Hilarious! Don't provoke me, smarty. Magicians are masters of illusion and use refined techniques. He can't even do the flower trick. Lilly, you have to help me. - I've got to make a… - Sacrifice. Sacrifice… I know! I have to make a sacrifice. What kind of sacrifice? My poor uncle is dead. He means king Nandi. Ah, yes. Right. I make the sacrifice - and I offer a new king to Mandolan. - Who? Who do you think? Guliman I. Sir, would you like to make a demonstration? Yes. I think… the throne is pretty normal. It doesn't look cursed. - Exactly. Where's the problem? - You'll see. Ha! An astronaut! Nice look! I understand. Did that also happen to your king? Poor Nandi was old. He went on a trip and it happened. What happened? That. The trip. And then… - The heart! - Exactly! His poor old heart stopped. Let's get down to business. The problem. Come on, super witch. Can you do it or not? Of course I can. But first I need… The magic potion. The magic potion? Oh, yes! The magic potion. - Clearly. - Exactly. I need… Let's see… Lava from Mount Vesuvius. African wood sawdust and… Kangaroo droppings. A magic potion? But you've got a note with the spell. I know, but I need both things. The potion and the spell. - Show me the spell. - Don't. It's top secret. - Show us the note or… - I'll tell you the spell. Marimbulo. As simple as that. But it only works with the potion. Let's go. - Get everything. - And if she's lying? Easy… This is… Better than a five-star hotel. Delicious! I smell something fishy. - No, it's real chocolate. - I mean Guliman and his magician. The one that can't do magic? - Those two are up to something, right? - Yes. First explain what you are up to. A real witch doesn't need potions. I want to know what's going on. Let's inspect. - I'm going in. Stay here and keep watch. - Yes, ma'am. Left, two, four, six… Four, six, left, two, four… A parrot! Go away! There are spies everywhere. Come with me. I can't go anywhere because… I can't tell you. - I've got a surprise. - OK, just for a moment. Come. The little… What a lookout! Well, little lady… Looking for something? Yes… My dragon. - It's small, green... - I know what he looks like. I'd better keep looking. See you. Don't forget the ingredients for the potion. Bye! So nice! That's it! - He's so sweet. - I like to marinate geckos. In almond oil. Then I beat them before roasting to make them tender. - Is that it? - No. I need to do the "clawdicure." "Clawdicures" are really something. - Great surveillance! - I had everything under control. What's that? Not now. Why are they shouting? Nandi! Stop! Silence! Everyone go home and shut up! Nandi! I said shut up! Boy! What are you doing? Nandi is not dead. Nandi is alive. Nandi is alive! I know it! - Nandi is alive! - Come back here! Get him! I have to find you. I need you. I don't believe you, little witch. Where is the spell? - Halt! The witch can't leave the palace. - Whose orders? - My captain's. - And who ordered him? What is three times eight minus two? I'll give you the answer in a bit. Oranges! The best oranges! - Hey, I want to see too. - Stay in the bag. If they catch you, you might end up roasted. - Can you see the boy? - Not yet. But I'll find him. Fresh fruit! The best fresh fruit! Lilly, will you buy me one? Pretty please? - A snake? Are you crazy? - No, a flute! Stop! That gecko looks good. Very juicy. Hey, white beard, I'm not a gecko. I'm a dragon! I want to see it. Let me see! Please. Just a little bit. Come on, just a little. A little ball for daddy. A little ball, you damn beast. Have a dump, you beast. Bottle genies! The sleepy genie will solve all your problems. This way. No obligation to buy. - Let me out. I want to see genies. - Be quiet. Ouch! My best specimen. Half-price for you. But only today. They're not real. They only exist in fairy tales. You offend me. My genies are the most real of all. Let me see. If a genie gets out, they serve you forever. You have to buy it. No! You're insulting me. Of course not. This is all I have. Don't take it literally. You must haggle. Say, "I've got five kids at home. I can't pay anymore." - "I've got seven mouths to feed." - Back in a minute! Thank you for buying a quality product from Mandolan. My name is Suki. Suki! What a beautiful name. Master? Master! …our wise and just grand vizier Guliman declares he is ready… - Nandi! - We don't want the grand vizier! - …to make a sacrifice for Mandolan. - We don't want him! Despite his grief after Nandi's death, he will take the throne and become the new king of Mandolan. He's alive! - There he is! - We don't want a new king. Listen to the sound of love, Suki. Marvelous, master. So I can learn your name, say it clearly and confirm with a clap. Let's hear it! Hector! - Master Hector, how can I help you? - I'm sure I can think of something. - My master is a musician? - Yes, that too. And a pilot, super dragon, gourmet, guardian… Precisely. My guardian. - Let's go. - No, I want Suki. I want to stay here… Master! - Suki! Let me out. - Bye. - I'm sorry, I have to go. - Please! Wait! You've let her out. You must buy her. Backpackers are all the same. - Master Hector. - Get back in the bottle. Good girl. Come here. Look who's here. - You can't escape. Take her to palace. - Let's go. Do it again, and I'll roast your gecko. - Where is it? - Did you say "roast"? There you go! Hurry, stop her! Hey! Come in. Hurry. To the right! Thank you. I'm Lilly. What's your name? - Musa. - Musa? What a great name. - Do you live here? - When I don't know where to go. Look. This is Hector, a flying dragon. Her guardian, even though I'm not allowed a little wish. Why is A brash chasing a couple of tourists? Have some respect. We're going to save Mandolan. You? You must be joking. Beware. Witches don't joke. We're here because Guliman asked for our help. You are a witch and you're helping Guliman? - I want nothing to do with you! - The throne is cursed. It's an ancient spell that protects us against false rulers. And I have the counter spell. I want to help you. Guliman and A brash are evil. You are in danger. If you have the counter spell, Guliman and A brash will find you. Wait here. I'll get you out of the city and hide you. OK? Where is that witch? You can come out now. Hold on. Move! Damn, a crow! Careful, those are Abrash's spies. - Let's go! - I would hold on tight if I were you. Hold on to what? There you are, witch, I know… Tough luck, I found you! It can't be. Where did the taxi go? - You pedal when you have a motor? - Yes. Don't you know what a motor does? - OK. - This is my motor. Mandolan taxis are always broken, except mine. And that way I don't use gas. So you're an environmentalist. Not a drop of lead. I see. We saw you yesterday, Musa. How do you know Nandi's alive? It's… - It's a secret. - Tell me or I won't be able to help you. Guliman and A brash keep him prisoner in the Forbidden City. - Let's go! - Impossible. It's called the Forbidden City. It's full of bad spirits. Not even a super witch can beat them. - Do you know anyone who's been there? - No one's ever come back. Please take us there. Aren't you the best taxi-driver in Mandolan? Yes, of course, but… Alright. All aboard! And now what? OK. Where is that witch? I've seen that film. That palace looks familiar. That's where you live, sir. - It's my… I mean, your palace. - Who do you take me for? How's the potion getting along? I'm missing something. Because the kangaroo is… - Constipated! - If you don't have the potion… - Yes, I know. - Exactly that. - We can't cross here. - What do we do? We'll have to find another entrance. Get off. Hurry. - You leave it here? - I have no option. Come! Search everywhere! Where is she? Follow me! That way! Come this way. Get in. We have to carry on. There he is. Let's go. Wait here. Hi, Gupta. Can you take us to the Forbidden City? - No. - Please. - We have to free the king. - OK, let's go. We're in luck. Simba will take us. - That man is Simba? - No. He's Gupta. He's Simba. He can be really fast. People call him Turbo Simba. - Careful, you might fall. - Don't worry. Relaxophant. He sleepwalks. Turbo, did you say? - Would you like to run? - Or fly? Ha, ha, always picking on me. Very funny. - This is Mandolan. Do you like it? - No, it shakes. If I don't eat something soon, I'll faint. I'm… Here. And stop moaning. It's amazing. Mom and Leon would love it here. - Do you have a lot of work as a witch? - No. I go to school. I live with my mom and my brother, Leon. He's insufferable. - Your mother taught you magic? - No. She doesn't know I'm a witch. - And your brother? - Not a clue. I don't have anyone. You don't have a family? No parents or siblings? I'm really sorry. It would be so great to have a brother. I see. But you haven't met Leon. An afternoon with him and you'd understand. I'd like to have a sister like you. Thank you, faithful crow. Now I know where the witch is headed. She's mine! What's that? It stinks! Kangaroo droppings, sir. Very fresh. - Very good. Where's the captain? - With the soldiers. Throw it in there. The cemetery of our gods. This is where Mandolan ends. - Do they live here? - They are Bedouins passing through. Apart from them, nobody comes here. Well done, Lilly. I'm proud of you. But unfortunately the worst is still to come. The elephant stays with the Bedouins? Yes, Gupta will stay with him. Behind that hill runs the river Mandok. And… - The Forbidden City. - Yes. Don't worry! We'll be back… I hope. Do something, Lilly! Cast a spell! I don't have anything for this. We have a big problem. That's it, Hector. Thank you. "Make a big problem small." Labriudum cosinistra piruna! What's going on? It's a spell. - That's awesome. - Attention! Formation! Fall in line! - They're very brave. - Hectornator in action! - Hector, wait. What are you doing? - I'm back! Oh, my God! It's Godzilla. Godzilla is alive! - Yes, kung fu! - He's back. Retreat! It's the 37th chamber of Shaolin. Fear me! Listen! Hey, I'm here. Eeny meeny miny moe, we'd better go! Garden gnomes on the run! Bye! Thank you! You're a great audience. I love Mandolan. A brash, if you want to be king, drink. Marimbulo. You'll pay for this, witch Lilly. Get up. Come on! Nobody tells me anything. What are you doing? I was… I just wanted to see… What it feels like… How brave you are jumping. The magic potion is ready. Your coronation will be wonderful, glorious. You'll see. You'd better be right, A brash. Or else, you're dead. Will they stay small forever? No, the spell doesn't last long. Don't worry, no one will follow us where we're going. I want to get out. I'm hot! It's even hotter outside. He's right, Hector. Hold on a bit longer. - And drink water. - The water is also hot. It's sweating. - Don't tell anyone. - Yes, sir. - Understood? - Yes. Forward march! We're going home. Yes, let's go home! We've arrived. You wanted to come here, right? So this is the Forbidden City? Water. Hurrah! I'm jumping right in! - No, wait! - Cannonball! The water's poisonous. You'll die! Poisonous? Get away from me! Get out of there, now! One question, Musa. How poisonous is poisonous? I'm… dying… All the best, Lilly. It was nice. Come on, you're scaring me. I need you. - Those are just words. - No. You saved us from the guards. Everyone will be proud of you when you tell them. Suki, too? Suki too, of course. Yes, I'm reporting from a village not far from the city… You know which. The situation is calm because… We haven't caught anyone. Yes. Thank you, captain, for this pathetic report. Losers! Come back immediately! So… What should I do now? Nothing. Lilly has no chance against my terrible spirits. When she's shrunk with fear, I'll catch her. She'll break the spell voluntarily, out of gratitude. Hector is feverish. Can you pass me the flask? It's empty. He's drunk it all. - We can't wait. We have to go in. - Yes, but… Now? It's getting dark and… And also… I'm sorry, but… I can't. It's alright. I'll go alone. I'm a super witch. I'm embarrassed, but… Don't worry. Someone has to stay with Hector. Hector. I have to leave you for a while. - To the Forbidden City? - Yes. Musa will care for you. - What? - Well, you will take care of him. Yes, sir. Wait. I've got something for you. Here. Take it. - Thank you. - Take care, Lilly. I'll be thinking of you. See you in a bit. - I'll bring back the king. - Good luck. Nobody can hurt me, right? It's not real. It's an illusion. I'm not scared. I'm scared! What can I do? What can I do? Something's wrong. Something's wrong with Lilly. Oh, no! Poor Lilly. No! Lilly, concentrate. Concentrate! So it was you! You wanted to scare me? Your greed is insatiable, A brash. - Did you swallow a frog? - No. I'm Lilly. And you must be king Nandi. I'm taking you back. There's no going back, Lilly. Everything's circular. Everything flows. My mom says it's impolite to turn your back when speaking. Thank you. - A brash has got the key? - No. It must be hidden around here. Be careful! A brash is treacherous. Be careful, Lilly. I'll be thinking of you. I knew it. Great! Thanks for the flute. Sweet dreams and get better. I don't find you all that chubby. Love handles here and there make a flying dragon more… Dragon-like. And that lovely face full of purple spots… I'm melting. What? Do I have purple spots? Feeling any better? - Who are you? - Hold on. I know a good healer. Lilly, please. Come back! You're smart and brave, Lilly. But who sent you? Where are you taking me? To the city, with your people. To your throne. My throne. Sometimes I think it's just a golden chair of no importance. I've seen the throne. It will only accept you. Mandolans want you to rule them. Not Guliman nor A brash. You have a good heart. And you're right. Let's go. - Wait! - Musa! This is Musa, the best taxi-driver in town. Stand up. Thank you for bringing Lilly. When people are mistreated, you have to help them somehow. Of course, Musa. - Will you help me? - Yes. Tell me what to do. Hector needs a doctor urgently. Goodbye, world, goodbye Now don't you weep for me - Is that Simba? - Yes. Goodbye, world, goodbye Now don't you weep… The dragon is very sick. I'll walk. You go on the elephant. - You'll take ages. Take the elephant. - I'll be there before you think. Guliman and A brash will be punished. I'll see you in the city. Oh, Suki, let's go on a trip Let's go to Kentucky Take Hector and put him in the rucksack. On the way back, you'll see why they call him Turbo Simba. - Won't it make me jump again? - Jump? You? Don't make me laugh. We've got the spell and the magic potion. - Let the people in for the coronation. - Let's wait. We still need to prepare. I never know what's going on. Everyone's busy and I rule alone. Yes, that's the thing with ruling. But I have something fantastic for you. A wireless telephone. Ask anything you want to know. See you soon, sir. Hello, A brash, respond. This is Guliman. What's happening? I knew it. What a stupid invention. It'll never catch on. Is that king Nandi? King Nandi is alive! Halt! Stop there! You can't park here. - Get that elephant out of here. - Now! Get it out! Stop! Stay where you are! There they are! Interesting. They didn't dare enter the Forbidden City. I got you, witch. Prepare the coronation. The coronation? Got it! - It's here. - They'll cure Hector here? Yes, trust me. - Sir, at your service… - What service? Come with me. Our friend is very sick. - He had poisonous water. - A poisonous daughter? Saddam also had a daughter. - She can't hear a thing. - She does. She's hard of hearing. A flying dragon. They're rare. They don't taste as good as geckos. It stinks! Sir. We meet again, super witch. - Hand me the spell. - In your dreams. Weren't you this small yesterday? Don't give it to him. I can take it. Ouch! Not so hard! No! Thank you. Did you think I'd fall for the charade with Marimbulo and the potion? Yes. I bet you tried. - Let's go. - What if she casts a spell on us? I assure you she can. They're terrible. She's just a feeble little girl. Let's go. It's hopeless. A super witch never loses her spells. You're right. It's the worst thing that can happen. The witch-jump at my age! There's no getting out of it. I can't jump. I have nothing from Mandolan. Where is… my purple-spots powder? What shall we do with the drunken dragon? It won't work. - I've got a plan. But you have to help me. - Anything. - OK, let's go. - But… what about Hector? She'll cure him. For sure. You have to find a way to stop Guliman taking the throne. - What about you? - I'll bring Nandi in the taxi. Do you have a better idea? We can do this. Yes, this one is nice, but it's lacking something. Do I look like a real king? Of course, you look perfect. - You're not lying to me? - Me? No, you're the king. I mean, very soon. I was missing this. Are you ready, sir? Yes. I'm ready. Holy toad leg! I do have something from someone in Mandolan. The bite is unmistakable. It tastes like cat's pee. A cat's flea? You're so funny. But fleas don't taste of anything. Yeah! - Do you feel better, little one? - Well, yeah! Green suits me much better. The operation was a success. Lilly. Where is Lilly? Lilly! Lilly! Musa! Where are you? You've got to help me. They mustn't catch me. Come with me. I'll disguise you. Silence! People of Mandolan, the moment we've been waiting for has arrived. Here I am. Today you will have a king again. Guliman is a handsome man and he'll soon wear a crown. With a bit more joy, damn! Young and old will sing, Guliman will be king. Thank you. You're all so kind. Thank you. - Wasn't Musa going to get Nandi? - Yes. They're taking ages. - Can't you cast a spell? - No. I don't know what to do. That's not the note I gave him. What does that mean? We're about to find out. "Marimbulo." "Marimbulo." Oh, my! He turned out to be an impostor. What shall we do to Guliman? Can you think of… anything? To the gallows! It's incredible. How do you do it? Training hard. We're in a hurry, your Highness. I know. I shouldn't have let Suki out of the bottle. Jumping into poisonous water and getting sick wasn't a good either. But apart from that, I didn't do that bad. Now I'm back in the game. Can someone pick me up, please? It's the boss! Something's really wrong. - Surulunda! - Hector! Thank you. I was looking for that. I'm glad you're better. Let's go, time is of the essence. I've been supervising everything. You know me. But when people go to forbidden cities, are caught by spy birds, travel in motor-less taxis and so on… Thank you, dear throne, for showing us the truth. I didn't know that Guliman was evil. He's lying. - Is that your note? - Yes. This is the end. I'm sorry, Surulunda. I did what I could. People of Mandolan, the throne knows who should be your king. The quiet and modest… A brash, the Greatest! Fly, Hector. Take the note off him. Are you a flying dragon or a chicken? Come on, fly! Come on, fly! My Hector is cured. Go, you can do it! There's the note. There it is. It's almost mine. It's mine! Bravo! Hector, we'll never be famous like that. What's the shrinking spell? Exsinistra or cosinistra? I can't remember. - It doesn't matter. Try it. - Labriudum exsinistra piruna. Damn! It's not what I wanted. Hector! Don't let A brash sit on the throne. Think of Musa, Nandi and… - Suki! - Suki? Suki! OK! It's the dragon's turn! You had it coming, you scoundrel! Hector attacks! I got it! That was close. Thank you. - Take fatty to a prison cell. - How dare you? Nandi. It's a miracle! Let me go. I want to kneel before my king. Take him away. Nandi! Long live king Nandi! Long live king Nandi! I'm so proud of you. Great job! Lilly! Musa! Surulunda, what are you doing here? Coincidence. I'm on a trip for seniors. - Did I do something wrong? - No, super-witch. You've had a few setbacks, but we can say, "Mission accomplished." I want to introduce my new grand vizier.
