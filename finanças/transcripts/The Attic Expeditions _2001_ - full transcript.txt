(eerie mysterious music) (door creaking) (electrical crackling) (medical equipment beeping) (muffled breathing) (razor buzzing) (eerie pensive music) (birds chirping) I just had the strangest dream. Was I in it? I think so. I'm forgetting it already. It's just slippin' away. Trevor, I want to stay with you forever. (Trevor laughs softly) I mean it. I want to be with you always. You will be, I promise. I love you, Trevor. I love you, Faith. Kiss me. (muffled breathing) [Nurse] Mr. Blackburn, please. This is an entirely painless procedure. Where am I? What's going on? [Nurse] Mr. Blackburn, please, just inhale. Dr. Ek? Wait, please wait! I don't know what's going on. Would someone please explain what's happening? I don't know how I got here. I don't even know where I am. [Dr. EK] Don't be difficult, Trevor. We've been through this before. You've just forgotten it all. Now, I understand that you're afraid. There's nothing to be afraid of. Trust me, I'm your doctor. My head is shaved? My brain? Oh, God, something's wrong with my brain? [Dr. EK] No, no, no, not at all, Trevor. Some minor adjustments have to be made. - Oh, no, no, no, no, no! - (head banging) Jesus! You have to understand, I can't just let you cut my head open if I don't know why you're doing it, even if that's why you're doing it! You can't just force me like this! - [Dr. EK] We can, Trevor. - You anticipated this. You signed a waiver that we wrote together. You see? Now, Trevor, think of it this way. Once you're asleep, you won't be afraid anymore, right? I guess not. [Dr. EK] And when you wake up, you won't be confused anymore. You will remember. So, let's just relax, take deep breaths for us, and everything will be just fine. All right, Nurse. [Nurse] Now, Mr. Blackburn, I'd like you to count backwards from 10 to one. Can you do that for me? (Faith chanting in foreign language) (tense music) (water dripping) Faith, what are you doing? (Faith chanting in foreign language) Faith, cut it out. (tense music) Faith! (Faith chanting in foreign language) (Trevor grunting) (Faith growling) (tense music) Hello, police, give me the police. There's been a murder. Thank you. (tense music) (flesh squelching) (flame crackling) Good morning, good morning. You get the machine working? I got the machine working. This is the guy? He's the one. Did you read the report? I read it. He's gonna be asking a lot of questions if he wakes up. Oh, he won't wake up, not now. Hello? Am I? Where? Did I make it? I'm off the clock. Oh, well, you're awake. My name is Trevor Blackburn. I'll tell the doctor. Just stay calm, she'll call the doctor. (telephone ringing) Dr. Ek's office. Yes, he's expecting your call. Hold, please. I am a wet nurse, not a bellhop. I believe this is your patient. Mr. Leventhal, what on- - Fine, I admit it. I was trying to escape, but it's because I saw the taxi. I mean, I would have tried to escape even if I didn't see the taxi- Security to the front desk. Two code sevens. Oh, no, no, no, no, you see, I'm not a patient here. I'm a doctor. I'm here on business. - It's the medication. - They make me take it. I think they have the wrong dosage, but they won't let me see a doctor. I feel fine. I feel wonderful, except for one thing, I'm shrinking. Subdue them both. No, no, no, no, no, no, I'm a doctor. I believe you're expecting me. - Oh, hi, Gary. - Of course you are, Doctor, and we're expecting you to cooperate. Measure me! Measure me! Gentlemen, please! I am a doctor. My name is Dr. Coffee. I'm here to see Dr. Ek. My credentials are in that briefcase. Any news? - I need to talk to him. - Heidi! - Heidi. - Eddie! That's Ed Coffee, I dated him at Johns Hopkins. Where are they taking him? Everything's prepared, which isn't to say everything's prepared for. (Laughs) Well, with so little time, you know? Yes, I expect today to be the... Oh, he's up, he's up. I have to go. - Dr. Ek. - Dr. Ek! No, no, no, I'm a very busy man. Please make an appointment. Dr. Ek, this is Dr. Coffee. - I'm Dr. Coffee, sir. - Dr. Coffee, my goodness. Phyllis, why didn't you tell me? - Hello. - I've been expecting you. Thank you. How do you like my little sanitarium? It's very atmospheric. (laughs) Yes. Do you know it is a pleasure to finally meet you, sir? Your work has been an inspiration to me. Yes, and I've read all of your published works. It's inevitable that we should work together. I'll tell you something, your timing is perfect. Is that so? Are we gonna get started right away? Because I'd like to freshen up and- - Oh, of course! Phyllis will show you to your rooms. You take your time. But to answer your question, yes, we have to start right away. We must. I'm going to meet the subject right now. - Fine. - Yes, indeed, a pleasure. Pleasure, sir. (thunder rumbling) Mr. Blackburn, I don't think you should do that. Doctor, he's trying to stand up. Is he now? Do you think you can stand up? No. How do you feel? I'm your doctor, Dr. Ek. Trevor Blackburn. We meet again. I think I feel okay. I don't remember what happened. Was there an accident? What do you remember, Trevor? I think I remember there was an accident, a horrible accident. What year is it, Trevor? The date, do you know the date? 2000. I'm afraid I have some very bad news for you, Trevor. It's 2004. The year is 2004, November 23rd, as a matter of fact. 2004? Yes, I'm afraid so. I've lost four years? [Dr. EK] Trevor. It's 2000 and... I think that you should come with me now. Come on. Let's go! Outta here. (tense eerie music) Come on, go! Come on. (tense eerie music) Come in. Please, go on, sit down. Do you mind if I smoke? I don't think so. It's a vice, I know. It's also against hospital rules. It's my hospital, my rules. Even so. So, Mr. Blackburn, tell me what you know, or think you know, if you can. I think I can. My name is Trevor Blackburn. I... (rain pattering) Doctor, what's happening to me? Watch carefully. (rain pattering) (soft pensive music) Trevor, you've been a patient at this institute for a little over four years. It's a private sanitarium, my sanitarium. We are a hospice for the criminally insane, Trevor. I'm afraid that you were committed to my care as a result of an involuntary court order as part of your sentence for a capital crime. I don't remember any of this. What did I do? Please, in time. When you first came here, Trevor, you were raving, violent, unapproachable, untreatable. I decided to operate, you understand? [Trevor] Go on. Well, the operation should have been routine, but unfortunately, we had to use an anesthesiologist not from this facility, and you suffered an allergic reaction as a result. You have been in a coma over the last four years. None of this sounds like anything that would happen to me at all, but I guess I wouldn't know. Could you please tell me what happened? You were engaged to be married. Her name was Faith. Bought a house, paid cash. Six months after you moved in, you murdered her, and I questioned you to determine your competency to stand trial. And you claimed to have authored, or to be in possession of some sort of magical book. Ringing a bell? (thunder cracking) I guess so. Couldn't place the image in its proper context. You believed that you committed this crime as a result of some sort of magical ceremony that went awry. Isn't there anything else you can tell me? What about family? Do I have any? Are they on their way? I'm afraid not, Trevor. You're an orphan. You were a man of no friends, few acquaintances, and one lover. That's all I can tell you. You could be talking about a stranger. But I guess that's what I am now, a total stranger. The human mind isn't fully equipped to understand the human mind, but it is, unfortunately, all that any of us has. What's going to happen to me now? I want to keep you here for observation till you're stabilized, a month or so, and then I'm going to send you to the House of Love. The House of Love, Trevor, is a place where you can begin to learn to think and act for yourself again among other recovering individuals, and you may find you have a lot in common with them. You'll help them and they'll help you. Your therapy will be uniquely personal. You must be Trevor. I'm Trevor. I'm Dr. Thalama, you can call me Abby. This is my house and my home. I like to think of myself and my patients, well, friends, really, as a family. Trevor, welcome to the family. (ominous music) It's been a long time since I've been in a house. It's a beautiful old house. It's very old. Down the hall is the kitchen and my private rooms. That door stays closed, but all the rest remain open. We don't like closed doors here. (birds chirping) This is the quiet room, one of our common areas. We like to think and relax in here. Many happy thoughts come out of this place. Amy, would you like to meet our new friend? Hello. Amy, this is Trevor. Trevor's going to stay with us from now on. Thank you, Amy. (pensive music) May I show this to Trevor? (pensive music) [Ronald] Oh, my goodness. (Laughs) Look at the time! It's nighttime- This is a game room. And you know what that means, little fishies? You're the specials, you're lunch! (Laughs) Oh! I'm sorry, Abby. Liz said I could. Well, she might've said you could do a puppet show, Ronald, but she never said you could frighten the fish! Trevor, that was Ronald, and this is Douglas. Hey, man. But don't trust anybody 'cause they're all fuckin' nuts. You want some homemade gum? No. The group meets in the game room at six. We're all here for you, Trevor. If you have any questions, any questions at all, please, don't hesitate to ask them. Thank you. Don't thank me, Trevor, thank yourself. It was hard work, I know, but you're home now. Home. (children yelling playfully outside) It was then, in that final wretched moment of sanity that I realized where the music was coming from, and I screamed, I screamed. I screamed, but those damned eyes did not blink, and the violin still screeched the terrible truth. I remembered, far too late, the words of the witch I had loved, that there are eyes within our eyes. Only these inner eyes see the truth of the matter, that there are dreams within our dreams. (fish tank treasure chest creaks dramatically) (trunk lid bangs loudly) I heard her voice again as I ran from that accursed house and into the woods, where the pagan oaks danced primal dances, and strange night birds jibbered in the darkness. Thank you, Liz. Does anyone have anything to say about Liz's story? Douglas? Is it true? Douglas, please. It seems as though I've read that story a long time ago. Do you remember where you read it, Trevor, or think you read it? No, I don't really remember anything before the hospital, before the operation. You know, Dr. Ek, I have this exact same setup at Columbia. (Dr. Ek laughs) Do you know I've read all of your published work? Well, thank you. But my understanding of your theories did not prepare me for this. This is amazing. This is all for one patient? Well, as we both know, this type of personal therapy can be quite expensive. In fact, the cost of maintaining his environment is prohibitive. Ah, mind if I ask how much? Yes. (Laughs) (Ed laughs) Well, let's just say prohibitive, which is why, please, I'm going to be pressing for immediate results. I'm afraid you and I are gonna be spending quite a lot of time in here over the next few days. Fine, fine. Who is he? His name is Trevor Blackburn. He's an acute schizophrenic. He was completely incapable of rational ideation before he began treatment here. The house made this particular subject perfect for our purposes, and so far, everything is progressing exactly according to plan. Good. Do you think he was lying? Think he remembers? It's hard to say. Excuse me. Frank! Frank, you're cutting it close. They're almost finished downstairs. And his reactions to the implants have been uncertain. You saw him react to the transmission. (Ed grunts in agreement) Well, we can guess, (chuckles) we can plan. If only we could read his mind. We will never truly know how he really feels. (tense eerie music) (crickets chirping) (Amy humming) It's Trevor. (Growls playfully) Trevor, come in. Close the door, would you? (Amy humming) It is possible to move a spoon without touching it, proper exertion of willpower. It's a fact, it's established. So far, I can't do it myself. I've been trying for 17 years. I understand why it has to be a spoon. [Trevor] Oh, I follow you so far. Aw, Trevor, you're okay, a man who knows how to talk to a lunatic. That's when you realize that you're not one, you know that, when you know that you're talking to one? You're a very handsome man, Trevor. You're the handsomest man in the whole House of Love. Thank you, Amy. You're very attractive yourself. Watch out, Trevor! Amy is crazy. Shut up, Doug! "Shut up, Doug!" I'm not crazy! "I'm not crazy." I'm not crazy! You're not crazy! Oops. I'm gonna make you a present, Trevor, a homecoming present. - Home. - Hell of a word, that. I'm gonna do it right now. (spoon clanging) I just wasted 17 years. Trevor, you don't know me yet, but I want you to trust me, and keep all your eyes open around Amy. I don't trust anyone, yet. You seem okay. I do, don't I? (crickets chirping) (pensive music) - [Faith] Honey! - (tense pensive music) (soft banging overhead) (typewriter keys clacking) (tense eerie music) (trunk banging) (lock clanging) (gentle knocking) (loud banging) (gentle knocking) (loud banging) (trunk creaking) (dramatic tense music) (wind whooshing) (dramatic tense music intensifies) (birds chirping) Morning, Trevor. Sorry, I didn't mean to startle ya. That's okay. You look like shit. Thanks. I didn't get much sleep last night. Well, no one does, their first night here, anyway. My first night here, I had the worst nightmares ever. And last night, well, I didn't sleep at all. But Trevor, watch out for Amy. She seems okay, almost too okay. Must be a really sad story, whatever brought a girl like that to a place like this. Rape fantasies, but that's why she's here. She used to pick up a guy in a bar, take 'em home, ball 'em, and then call the cops in the morning to come take 'em away. She did it a couple times before anyone noticed, but one guy did six months hard time for her, I heard. He's out now, she's in here. Besides which, she's not your type. Douglas, I met you yesterday. I haven't met a woman in four years. Neither of us knows what my type is. Trevor, this is day one. Today will be marked down as the first day on your progress chart. I'm not going to explain punishments or restrictions to you until I have to. Hopefully, I never will. We only have one rule here. The rule is that you must get a little bit better every day. Can you handle that, Trevor? I'll do what I can. May I? Oh, (laughs) it's only coffee. Well, I thought, you know, with my medication- - Oh, we're not giving you anything too terribly strong. Sit, please, sit. Cream and sugar? Please. (clock ticking) (Abby laughs softly) Now then, every day, I try to talk to everyone one-on-one. That way, I can keep track of how you're all doing. So tell me, how are things so far? Everything's great, Abby, great. This house, it reminds me of some place, some place I used to live with Faith, you know, when we were happy. Feels like home. Wonderful. It is. It really feels like it is. And the nightmares last night? I don't remember. I usually don't. It's my medication, I think. Wonderful. Oh, well, not that you don't dream ever, but that you don't have any bad dreams. I don't. You know, Trevor, you always dream. Sometimes we forget, but all of us always dream. (Echoing) (tense pensive music) (typewriter keys clacking) (gentle knocking) Liz? (gentle knocking) That's Liz's door. I know, I heard the typewriter. Do you know why Liz is in here? She's crazy? See, Liz writes all the time. You know, I mean all the time. She thinks that if she quits writing, things will stop happening. She thinks she's writing everything, the world as it happens. You follow? Sure. What's she doing now? The typewriter stopped. That's a good question. (Douglas knocking) Liz! What are you doin' right now? [Liz] Proofreading. Good answer. She's not your type either. (Douglas whistling) (soft tense music) (playful eerie music) Do you wanna talk to me? Trevor, I'm frightened. Frightened? Frightened. What are you afraid of, Ronald? It is Ronald, right? That's right, Ronald, and you're Trevor. Trevor, I don't even know her! I'm sorry. And I'm the professor. I don't know her either. Shut up, just shut up, for Christ's sakes! This is important. There are some things I need to tell you, Trevor, things you need to know. Take it easy, Ronald. He's wrong, Trevor, listen to me. I'm sorry, Trevor, just- You've always lived in the house, Trevor, you- When Dr. Thalama, Abby, first moved in and took over, she had this book she brought with her. It was like one of those big illustrated Bibles, you know, like in libraries? Right, right, right, I've seen one of those recently in a roller rink somewhere. This book wasn't a Bible. I've never seen or heard of anything like it. It looked old, much too old to be carryin' around. Get it, Trevor? Please, let him finish. (tense music) Every day, Abby would get out this book and read to us to start off group therapy session. She said that it would help us and teach us something, like a lesson for the day, you know? But it was obviously just an excuse. It didn't matter 'cause there was no one there to tell her how to run things at the time. And for a while, she let us smoke cigarettes, so? Nobody really thought about it. I did. I told her. Sure you did, and we're still in here, aren't we? Trevor, you gotta get me outta here. I don't know what's happening to me! I can't tell you who I am, because I can't remember a goddamn thing! My mind's all fucked up in this goddamn puppet head! But I swear to you, with God as my witness, I am not this guy's hand! I'm real! I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm- Help me! I can't take any more of this lunacy, Ronald. Trevor, the book was blank. I finally saw the pages, and they were blank, and I think she knows I saw it. That was the last time she used the book. Liz arrived the next day, and she never talks about where she came from. And the stories Liz writes, and the stories she reads in group session, they're just like the book, Trevor. And she never lets you see the paper they're on either, because it's all in her head, and it's all out of that empty book! Ronald, will you shut up? Will you... Let me go! (light bulb pops) No, Trevor, please! I was only trying to help! Please, don't hurt me! Don't! Well, the violence you've just seen is unexpected, but in this case, certainly not exceptional. Psychoactive medication can be tricky, and the drugs we're giving him, well, obviously, we have just as much to learn about the medication as we do about the patient. What are you planning on doing with him next? Another operation, adjusting the subsequent dosage of the injections accordingly. Subsequent injections accordingly. (sighs) Dr. Ek, I understand that it is my privilege to observe and record. It's not my place to judge, but this all seems very unwieldy. Of course your patient's going to crack. Hell, I would. There's too many variables involved. Experimenting under such conditions makes repeating it impossible. I appreciate your concern, Dr. Coffee, but I can assure you there are factors concerning this case that, frankly, you couldn't possibly grasp, not yet. Certain esoteric knowledge is at stake here. You see, it's not just Trevor's mind that I'm concerned with. It's his soul. You don't need to write that down. (knocking on door) (typewriter keys clacking) Hello. You haven't seen my room yet. Would you like to? [Trevor] Sure. (typewriter keys clacking) [Amy] What do you think? You can tell me the truth. I don't mind. Uh, I think I'll have to think about it before I can think about it. (typewriter keys clacking) (pensive music) Wait, wait, wait, wait a second, Amy. Why are you here? What did you do to end up in this place? (pensive music) Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I just... I need to know before something really real happens. (pensive music) It's okay, Amy. Look, I'll understand. I'm here too, right? (pensive music) It doesn't matter what you say, what I say, or anyone, because if it's real, then it is. And if it isn't, we don't have anything. (pensive music) This is real, isn't it? (Amy moaning) ♪ Do you want to play with me ♪ ♪ Your blood runs. ♪ (singing drowned out by music) (Amy moaning) Cover my mouth, I'm gonna scream. (tense pensive music) (water dripping) (mirror creaking) (intense rock music with indistinct singing) (muffled screaming) (Amy screaming) (Amy crying) (tense pensive music) Who was screaming up here? What happened? They got Ronald. (tense music) [Trevor] Wait! Let us out! Open this up! What the hell do you think you're doing? Who's in there? What are you hiding? If I catch you near that door again, you will be restrained and isolated. Do I make myself perfectly clear? (crickets chirping) (tense music) (birds chirping) [Trevor] My headache just went away, just like that, all of a sudden. [Douglas] You know, I don't think anyone's even touched that foosball table the whole time I've been here, and I was here before anyone. [Trevor] We could break it in if it's startin' to get to you. [Douglas] Trevor, please, for all we know so far, the thing, it's not even real, and it could be a group hallucination, or hologram. I'm pretty sure I touched it yesterday. You can't fuck me up that easy. Your lies, they're cheap. [Trevor] Doug, Doug! I like Douglas. Okay, Douglas, look. I have a serious question to ask you. I know you can't give me a straight answer even if you have one, but I have to ask it anyway. How awkward for you. Yeah. You see, I've been gathering together all of the memories that are clear enough for me to say for sure that they actually happened, and I'm being very careful and very rational with this, but there isn't much clarity. Okay, that wasn't a question, was it? No, look, if someone's doin' something to me, to my head, and you know somethin' about it, could you tell me? I mean, we can just keep it between us and just keep playin' along, but to tell you the truth, it's startin' to get to me, you know, startin' to shake me up a little bit. Like I don't have boundaries or edges or anything. No, no, no, like I did or, like, I don't know what it feels like to have boundaries or edges. I just keep thinking that if I can get better, then I can go home, but I think I'm fine. And this house- - Okay, all right, how 'bout we just back up to the point where the question mark was? Let me pick it up from there. We'll just strike that moment of weakness from the record. What do you say? You don't have a straight answer for me. None of you do or ever will. Trevor, fine, you want the opinion of a virtual stranger in a sanitarium? Okay, but you're just gonna get what you're asking for, healthy paranoia. It's debatable, like, how far you should take it, or how much you should talk about it. Now, I'll point this out to you and you think about it however you want, but you don't ever mention it again, because when you talk about it, you give it power inside your mind. Do you follow me? Could you just give me a straight answer? Just one straight answer. Okay, straight up then. No one that you ever knew, or you loved, or that loved you or that you cared about, or anyone who was ever anything to you, that made you think that they might be as real as you are, ever proved that the rest of us aren't all in it together against you. The big secret, I don't care who you're thinkin' might be an exception, they aren't, and you will never know. Now, I might, I could tell you that all six billion of the rest of us are out to get you. It's farfetched for sure, but the chances are just as good as any other illusion you ever needed. Now, I don't talk about it, because when you talk about it, you just make it worse, but I think about it a lot. And now, so will you, because it is in you now, and it has a mind and a will of its own, if any idea ever did. And you won't ever forget it. Oh, but don't blame me, because you fuckin' asked for it. Thanks, Doug. I'll rest easy now, I bet. I got more, if you want more. No, I don't think I can take any more. You sure? I mean, we could play the foosball, take your mind off it. [Trevor] Maybe if you touch the foosball table, I'll be the guy that killed Ronald, and you'll be next. You're a stand-up guy, Trevor, you really are. But you still don't know why I'm in here. Oh, sure I do. You're working for them. You're the guy I'm supposed to trust enough to confide in. No, Trevor, I cut my testicles off with a paring knife when they kicked me out of the Pink Floyd. (knocking on door) Come in. Trevor, you're new, so let me explain a few things to you about how I run my house. Generally, we don't frown on couplings. We find them to be, for the most part, therapeutic. After all, this is the House of Love. What do you think, Trevor? (Trevor sighs) What should I say, Amy? Amy claims that you were seducing her while the murder occurred. I didn't think I was seducing her. I thought it was something we were doing together. Any one of us could have murdered Ronald, but the only murderer in my care is you. Needless to say, I will do everything in my power to see that there is not a second death. You're quick to anticipate. I didn't use that word, Trevor, you did. (tense music) (sighs) How'd I do? (tense music) (children yelling playfully outside) (tense ominous music) (typewriter keys clacking) Where do you think you're goin'? Um, you know, just... So I just got back from my interrogation, and you know how it is. I mean, once you start having to make things up, you can't remember which lie went with which question. I had an alibi. (typewriter keys clacking) I could use a drink. God told me I could use a drink. (typewriter keys clacking) You can tell I've been here for awhile. I've got my own chair. Please. (typewriter keys clacking) Care to join me? Yeah, yeah. Hell yeah. (typewriter keys clacking) You know, Trevor, this stuff is hard to come by in here, but it's not that hard, so please, help yourself to whatever your required dosage is. (typewriter keys clacking) It's Liz, and she's right next door, and she never quits with the typing. It'll make you crazy. (typewriter keys clacking) [Trevor] How long was Ronald here? Uh, you mean when did they bring him here? I don't know, a while ago. I was here, I know that. Time doesn't work the same way as it's supposed to in here. (tense ominous music) Yeah, I know what you mean. (typewriter keys clacking) So tell me, Trevor, (Trevor inhales forcefully) Did you carve up our friend, Ronald? You read a lot of books, don't you, Douglas? Yeah, books are cheap. The allowance my uncle gives me isn't enough to keep up with the kids' music, so I read. Do you know anything about magic? Card tricks? Oh, hey, a rabbit! No. Magic with a K? Yeah, like casting spells, possession. Like... (dramatic tense music) (glass shattering) Ceremony. You never answered my question. You ever go up in the attic? The attic? No. (laughs) The attic is shrouded in mystery. I've dreamt about it. My god, that's insane. Yeah, nightmares, mostly when I first got here. I was always in the attic in my dreams. Do you ever get the trunk open, see what's inside? I've had the same nightmares. It could be worse. If it's happening to both of us, then we know it's real, unless somehow, one of us is lying. (tense pensive music) In my dreams, the trunk was always locked, but there was something trying to get out. I got it open last night. Last night? Last night while Ronald was being killed? Yeah, that's right. Did you kill him? I don't think so. (typewriter keys clacking) (knocking on door) Liz, it's Trevor. Could you come out, please? I need to ask you something. [Liz] Trevor, when you interrupt me, you're wasting everyone's time. I just need for you to explain something to me. Please, it'll only take a second. [Liz] You're knocking on the wrong door. (sighs) Liz, you know you're not writing anything I haven't already written. Now, please, let me in! Trevor? I thought you were knocking on my door. I wasn't. But if you did, you could come in, and we could talk, just for a minute, if you have to go some place else, or do something. Please, Trevor. (typewriter keys clacking) What do you want from me now, Amy? Trevor, just right now, I'm scared. I need you to- - I really wanna get better! You should understand that. God! I don't wanna make it any harder for you either, I really don't. I don't. (sighs) Dammit, Amy, why did you tell them that I raped you? Trevor, what was I supposed to say? I've accused every man who ever touched me. If I told her the truth, do you think that she'd believe me, if I told her that you were here with me while the murder was going on? See? She won't believe that you raped me, but she can't believe that you killed Ronald. It was the right lie to tell. What happened last night, between us, I mean- - It was perfect. It was the most perfect ever. I wasn't supposed to, you know, but I made the right decision, for both of us. (loon vocalizing) (typewriter keys clacking) Are you ready? I'm ready, let's go. - Hey, hey- - Hey. You finish the rest of that whiskey? No. Well, just about. I saved two good shots. (typewriter keys clacking) Hey, if you knock the door down, I'll go up first up the stairs. (typewriter keys clacking) (mysterious pensive music) This is what I dreamed. [Trevor] Same. (laughs) Why are we whispering, man? It's not like anybody can hear us. Although, I would watch where you put your feet though, because you don't want to end up in bed with Liz, or something. Uh, maybe we should should leave before something happens. Wait, Trevor, hold those horses. I'll bet if I kick this latch hard enough, it'll come open. What do you think? No, no, don't worry, no big deal. You just hang back by the stairs there. [Faith] Trevor! Oh, God, she's in there. I killed her. She wants to pull me in there with her. Quit with that, it doesn't help anything. No, you heard her, Faith, from the trunk! She's dead! I know, but Trevor, I'm standing right next to the trunk and I didn't hear anything. [Faith] You have to let me out, Trevor! Okay, you heard it that time. I know you heard it that time! Trevor, collect yourself, okay? I didn't hear anything. You're only hallucinating. Something's gonna happen, we should get outta here. Fine, you go, and in five minutes, I'm gonna have the trunk open. I'll share the treasure with you, I promise. And in the meantime, I won't let her get ya. (tense music) (Trevor yelps) Hey, man, you okay? Don't hurt that trunk, it's my head. And you knocked me over because it's my head, and you tried to kick it open. Hang in there, Trevor, you're gonna be just fine! Ow! Don't, don't, please, please don't, don't! (dramatic tense music) (Trevor groaning) (typewriter keys clacking) Liz, Liz, Liz, stop writing! Stop writing, stop what you're writing right now! (typewriter keys clacking) (tense music) Liz, open this fuckin' door! I'm comin" through! Open this door! (glass shattering) (door rattling) (tense eerie music) Liz? (knife whooshing) (flesh squelching) (tense eerie music) It's a lie, it's a setup! These goddamn stories are mine! (Panting) I don't care what's real anymore. I'm not responsible for any of this. Stop scaring me, please. Stop scaring me! [Dr. EK] One more thing, gentlemen. Tell Dr. Thalama to go ahead and give him the amanita extract this time. [Ed] The amanita injection, now? Is that necessary? It's the strongest hallucinogen we have at our disposal. - That's my point exactly. - He's already disoriented. Yes, Dr. Coffee, my point exactly. He's ready for it. (tense eerie music) (birds chirping) Hello, Faith. Hello, Trevor. [Trevor] Where are we going? I'm taking you home, baby. It's been a long time, Faith. Maybe we should go for a drink, or something. Trevor, I love you, but I have a lot to tell you, and I'm not sure how long I'm gonna be able to talk to you like this. - They said you were dead. - They said that I murdered you. My death was your first mistake. I make all mistakes. We all make mistakes. They've given you a new drug. It must be pretty strong. Whatever it is, don't let it shake you up, okay? I'm here because you have to finish what you started by yourself. I'm here, baby. I am really here. Here we are. (tense eerie music) Welcome home, Trevor. (tense music) Trevor! (muffled distorted chattering) (intense rock music) (indistinct singing) (loud banging) (men laughing maniacally) (Trevor panting) It's okay, Trevor. This house has many mansions. It's best if you take it one room at a time. [Trevor] Let go of my hand. (eerie music) (lamps creaking) I need both my hands now. Okay. (eerie music) [Faith] It doesn't wanna focus on you. Wait, I remember something. It's dead. I wondered what got recorded on the tape that night that made them decide you killed me. I don't know what it looked like, but it couldn't have looked like a murder. Guess it doesn't matter. They would have convicted you anyway. Yeah, there we go. (laughs) There we go. - What is it? - No, no, stay there, you can't look. See, I can see where you really are in here. How much do you remember, Trevor? I remember the accident. Nothing was accidental, okay? It was a ceremony. You were a magus and I was your student. The rituals, they're psychic abstractions. I'm sorry, I don't know what you mean. (sighs) Dammit, you don't. You don't remember where the book is. The book? Faith? The book. Faith! [Dr. EK] Did he just say Faith? [Tech boys] Yes. Interesting. Isn't that very, very interesting? (Trevor groaning) Is this state your patient is in the expected results of your treatment, Doctor? One of several. (Trevor groaning) It's certainly not a negative development. New possibilities are always presenting themselves. The very least I can say, with regards to what I have just seen, is that some things require privacy in the name of decency. You understand the concept of decency at all? Oh, decency I understand. Privacy's a myth, and I have a prescription. Your methods are questionable, Dr. Ek, and the results, I am now quite certain, are detrimental to your patient. I see. [Ed] Where are you going? I'm going to talk to him. That will do a lot of good, I'm sure. Dr. Coffee, I'm on the brink of perfecting a universal treatment for every mental illness ever suffered. Your concerns are petty and small. Whatever Trevor may feel now, he will thank me once he's been perfected. (door creaking) Send him in, Phyllis. Come in, please. Sit down. (rain pattering) (eerie music) (book thudding) Transfers may not occur until the correct point in this cycle has returned. The flesh of the second party must be prepared as before, as well as the seat of reason, and finally sealed within the confines of the pentacle. Now, speak the secret fourfold word, the blasphemy against all gods and men. I wrote that a long time ago. No, you didn't, though it bears some resemblance to your work. You remember? Passage rings a bell? I think I remember a little. I see. Trevor, we'd like to hear your story again. Perhaps you have a fresh perspective, new insight. I was living with my fiancee. We were very much in love. We just bought a house. There was a ceremony. I thought she was trying to kill me. (eerie mysterious music) (birds chirping) I just had the strangest dream. Was I in it? I think so. I'm forgetting it already. I want to be with you forever, Faith. I always want to be together. Then I promise we will be. I love you, Faith. I love you, Trevor. - Kiss me. - Let's buy a house. A house? A house, a big house with lots of rooms for just the two of us, two times too many rooms to use. A house so big, we could get lost in it and never find our way out. And we can hide together. (eerie mysterious music) (soft tense music) (trunk creaking) The pages of the book are blank, unless you are meant to read it. Only you could read the book, and it taught you, and you taught me. You convinced me to perform the ceremony. Maybe if you could explain to me about this ceremony, I could understand. But I'm never gonna understand if you just- - It's the ceremony of transferal. You learned it from the book. Is it in this room somewhere? But this room isn't even really here! (laughs) Of course it is, it always has been. This house was ours before it was theirs. Come on, Trevor! Where'd you hide the book? None of this is real. Wait a second, I'm making all this up. You're not really here. Right! It's all in your mind. And I'm in here with you, and I'm makin' it up too. I love you, Trevor, and every time I ever touched you is perfectly preserved right here. All we have to do is perfectly remember. ♪ Got prickles on my skin ♪ ♪ Tastes (indistinct) when I walk ♪ ♪ Hear the angels dancing, but they do not need to talk ♪ ♪ Keep my mind from racin' (indistinct) ♪ ♪ Keep singin' those memories ♪ ♪ Go down on me ♪ (singer vocalizing) (Faith panting) (Trevor grunting) [Faith] Look, we can't hide here much longer. Who's killing people in the House of Love? [Faith] The House of Love is a lie. It's all for you. The other patients are actors. Ek wants the book. [Trevor] What do I do? You have to finish the ceremony. If you were dead, instead of me, you would have powers undreamed of. Your concentration broke, Trevor. The ceremony was meant to leave us both in my body, not yours. Sweetheart, give me the book and let me finish what you started. What good is the book to you if only I can read it? For me to be free, you have to die. That's the only thing you can do. I couldn't live without you, and I can't die without you. We've done terrible things. I've done terrible things, Faith. I see things you can't imagine. No, the book is well hidden, Faith, and it's useless to you, and it's useless to Ek. Only I can read it, unless Ek knows something I don't know he knows. Fine, if you won't kill yourself, then I'll do it for you. I can use anybody I want, I'm free to roam the astral realm. I can possess somebody in the house. I could possess Amy. (Laughs) I saw you with her. (sighs) We could be lovers in the flesh again. Leave Amy alone. [Faith] When you return to the House of Love, I'll be there, hiding in some nice warm body, and then I'll kill you, and then we're even. (sighs) Guess I don't know you very well, do I? You don't love me. Oh, I did, until you broke your promise. What promise? You promised we'd stay together forever. (warm pensive music) (laughs) Trevor. I'll be seeing you. I've been watching you, Trevor. I've been recording it. You've spoken aloud, but I couldn't quite follow. It was all so disjointed. You made reference to a book, do you remember? A book? A book that you'd either written or you had possession of. It was never quite clear which. Do you remember the book? What do you remember, Trevor? Dr. Ek, I don't remember much of what happened, or how much of it is real, but I do know that I lost the woman that I love very much because of what I did. I think I'm a changed man, Dr. Ek. Trevor, the human mind isn't capable of fully understanding the human mind, and it is unfortunately all I have. It's all any of us has. Trevor, I'm going to send you to the House of Love. The House of Love, Trevor, is a place where you can begin to learn to think and act for yourself again among other recovering individuals. And you may find you have a lot in common with them. You'll help them and they'll help you. You must be Trevor. Abby, why did they bring me back here? I'm Dr. Thalama, you can call me Abby. This is my house. [Trevor] Don't you know me? The group meets in the game room at six. If you have any questions, any questions at all, please don't hesitate to ask them. I think I'll save my questions for the group. (tense pensive music) Trevor. We need to talk, Amy, or whatever your name is. You're a very handsome man, Trevor. - Enough! - (milk splattering) I don't know how desperate for money you are, or what they told you I did to deserve this, but I can't imagine what it would take to make you involve yourself in a conspiracy to drive another human being insane. I suppose you're a professional actress. Well, you've done your job well, Amy. If there's anyone I hold responsible for how I feel right now, or what I might have to do, it's you. Trevor, it doesn't matter what you say, or I say, or anyone, because- - Please, please, can't you see what this psychodrama, or whatever the hell you want to call it, is doing to me? It's 2000. It's over, and no matter who or what I once was, or what I might have done, I cared about you, and you fucked me because they thought it would push me over the edge. Isn't that right? I'm going to hell, and you're gettin' a goddamn paycheck. Isn't that right, Amy? You were supposed to get better. My name isn't Amy, it's Karen. And I had doubts, but they told me that you were gonna get better. Trevor, you should know you never got to touch me in the script. They didn't even ask me to, but you wanted me, and I cared. I do, I do care. I care about you, Trevor. Not Amy, me. Well, to hell with you, whatever your name is. But Trevor, wait! I'm on your side! We need to work this out! Please don't leave. You made me break character. No one is on my side. [Ed] Dr. Ek, it is so obvious that your treatment of Mr. Blackburn has brought on a resurgence in his schizophrenia. Well, certainly, you can see that Trevor is beginning to puzzle things out for himself. I would call this definite evidence of my success. I'd call it a failure. (scoffs) Please. You know what, to continue is not only pointless, it's immoral. (laughs) That's ridiculous. You know, I thought I knew you in theory, but it's obvious that I don't, and I don't even want to. I am disillusioned. Oh, you're disillusioned? Oh, yes, thoroughly, thoroughly disillusioned. And another thing, don't think I won't tell the review board about this, because I will. And as for your little prescription, listen, I am a doctor, sir, and I have never seen such a flagrant disregard for the use of chemical- - You have been my guest! Do you understand? You have seen what you have seen because I have allowed you to see it, and for no other reason. Now, as far as your accusations, I intend no harm to anyone, and despite your opinion, thus far, no one has been. We are going to continue because Trevor has not given us what we want! Trevor Blackburn - is not a lab monkey! - And as far as your disillusionment, I can assure you, you have not been thoroughly disillusioned yet, Dr. Coffee. Yes, I have. Not yet, but you will be, you impudent prick. You will be by the time I'm through with you. (tense music) Welcome, Trevor. Come in, sit down. Relax, Liz is just- - I know all about it, Abigail, if that's what your real name is. Who's in charge here? Is it you? Me? Uh, no, Trevor. Funny you should ask though- - Look, I know you're all actors, okay? I know I'm the only real patient here. It's okay, keep it up. You're all very good. I just need for whoever's in charge to hear what I have to say. Are you listening? We're listening. Ek, I abjure you by the powers I embody and have embodied by Azathoth, Astaroth, et cetera. You know the names, I don't need to repeat the litany for innocent ears, do I? Are you listening now, Ek? Are you? Do you hereby hear me officially? I am a sane man, and you have failed to live up to your obligations, host to guest. Got that? Host to guest. I know you must be dying to ask, Ed. Please, feel free. Please don't kill me. All right, I suppose it doesn't matter if I tell you now. Power of the old ones. The dark forces, if you will. I want his book. Hmm? I mean, you see the irony in this, don't you? A scientist would never consider the question of good and evil. To an empirical mind, the truth is simply the truth. If you could prove it, the facts have no morals, they just are. And the same science has just dismissed, outright, the very notion of magic. But what is magic, Doctor? Left-handed or right, black or white? What is magic but a science that is too esoteric for the modern scientific methods to prove? I mean, after all, all science was once considered magic. 500 years ago, they would have burned us both. They would have. (crickets chirping) (knocking on door) Come in. Look, I'll tell you everything I can. I'm only an actor, but the project is falling apart, and I think you deserve a little human decency now. I'll tell you everything I know. I know who's responsible. Ek. That's right, Dr. Ek. I only met him once, but since this whole thing started, he's been watching us all the time, watching all of us and making video tapes. It's over, though. Now that you know, today's the last day. We go home at midnight. Douglas, someone is going to try and kill me, someone in this house. Somebody's in someone's head, one of the actresses, probably Amy, but I can't be sure. I see. Well, that's really between you and Dr. Ek. He can hear you. He can hear everything. Look, Trevor, I don't know how crazy you really are, but the things they're doin' to you, it can't be helping. You need, like, a lawyer, or something. I know her. I know she'll try and fuck me again before she kills me. (laughs) That's Faith. - Who? - Faith. Look, I know it sounds crazy. You say Ek is listening, right? Hangin' on your every word, no doubt. - Great. - Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, but I must tell you, I'm just, I'm too selfish to share my techniques with anyone. And, well, once I have the book, I'm just going to be very busy. Oh, thank you, Ed, that's beautiful. Sadly though, you won't be able to experience my techniques first-hand because... Well, no, I should say you will never be sane again to remember experiencing them, because, Doctor, Ed, I have no further use for- - No, please. (syringe squirting) (Ed groaning) (dramatic tense music) (body thudding) (soft tense music) Phyllis, there's an attempted escapee in the control room. No need to worry, I've sedated him, but I want him taken back to ward 23 immediately, please. (knocking on door) [Douglas] Liz, it's Douglas. Come in. Hey, Terry, how are you doin'? Dr. Thalama needs the typewriter for some reason. I'm supposed to bring it to her downstairs. Caroline? She must mean the old one. The old one? (typewriter keys clacking) [Dr. EK] He's the one. The actor playing Douglas has forgotten everyone's name. Send the orderlies in. Tell them to subdue Douglas and bring him here immediately. Make sure he doesn't see it, if it even matters anymore. Oh, it matters. (tense music) (typewriter keys clacking) (knocking on door) (banging on door) This is the kicker, the strangest job ever. What do you think? I don't care, now that I get to hit somebody. (Douglas panting) (tense music builds) (loud thudding) That definitely was somebody. (doorknob rattling) Run back? No, maybe you should kick the door in. (tense music) Oh, good, you're just in time. Come in. This is the fucking guy, right, Douglas? No, no, no, no, I'm Ronald. Douglas is the big fat guy upstairs. You guys should use your clubs on him. Quickly! [Orderly] Lead the way. (tense music) Here I am. Here we are. Fuck me one more time. I already have. I love you. Faith. [Nurse] Doctor, he's awake. (Trevor screaming) (dramatic tense music) (light bulb popping) [Karen] Trevor, please don't hurt me! Trevor, no! (Karen groaning) (dramatic tense music) (Trevor panting) Hello? (loud whacking) That's for backtalk, fat boy. Where's your friend? Lookin' for a place to shit, knowing him. They don't let us get out of the car much in here. Uh-oh, you askin' for it? (Trevor sobbing) (tense music) - I could go there myself. - It's a 20-minute drive there. This is useless, utterly useless. Damn it all to hell. (tense music) (body thudding) (exaggerated whacking) (flesh squelching) Liz, run! He's a mad man! (tense music) (car engine starting) (car tires screeching) Where you goin'? I don't know, away. Good. Somebody's about to get fuckin' hurt, that's all I have to say. (body thudding) All the notes, all the paperwork, the discs, anything they could use to pin anything on anyone. [Techboys] What should we do with them? You both are also walking evidence. I would strongly suggest eastward migration as soon as possible. I'd go myself, but someone has to complete the record. (tense music) (Douglas laughing) Where'd you get the club? I killed the guys that had them. It's funny, it doesn't really feel like they're really dying when you're not really the killer that you're being. (tense music) So everyone's dead? Well, Ron and Liz got away. Otherwise, yeah, except you and me. And I'm Faith, by the way. I decided not to try and fuck you after all. I thought I'd just Kill you and get it over with. What a world. And now, I'm here to make you keep your promise. (energetic rock music) Oh, that's good. Trevor, just wait in there for me while I beat the door down! ♪ How, how should I kill Spooky ♪ ♪ Tonight ♪ ♪ How should I kill Spooky ♪ (bed screeching) ♪ Spooky ♪ ♪ I try my best to play with you and be your friend ♪ ♪ Spooky ♪ ♪ And you run away ♪ ♪ And then I go my own way ♪ ♪ Yeah, you get in my way ♪ (Douglas screaming) (door rattling) (Douglas screaming) (club whacking door) (crickets chirping) (glass shattering) We're only trapped in an imaginary house, but I really do need to kill you. It's true, you see, if you kill me, then there'll be nothing left but you and your hallucinations, trapped here, alone forever. And do you know how long forever is? And you are lucky that I love you enough to do this for you. (wood creaking) (floor crashing) (tense eerie music) (Trevor groans) (dramatic tense music) Trevor! - Trevor! - Trevor! (flesh squelching) Trevor. (flesh squelching) I loved you. Kiss me. (flesh squelching) [Faith] Kiss me. (flesh squelching) (soft pensive music) (Trevor sighs) (telephone buttons beeping) (telephone ringing) Hello? There's been a murder. Yes, a murder I said. The incorporated is protected. No, you're wrong, I'm succeeding! If I hadn't broken Trevor's mind, you never would've retrieved the book within my custody! Now he's found the book, hasn't he? All I have to do is get it back from him. (tense music) Good morning, good morning. You get the machine working? Got the machine working. This is the guy? He's the one. Did you read the report? I read it. He's gonna be asking a lot of questions if he wakes up. Oh, he won't, not now. Well, I'm off the clock.
