(dramatic music) (tense music) (guns clicking) (tires squealing) (gunfire popping) (booming) (tense music) (doors thudding) (Raul chuckling) - This Carlo Giovani is not as tough as I thought he would be. Soon it will be Raul Guzman who controls the City of Angels, and the Italians will come to me for favors. (tense music) - Why is she always late? She knows I don't like it. - Mr. G, you know she likes to make an entrance when she gets new clothes. - Well. What do you think? - Very nice. - [Carlo] You're not dressed for dinner. - Yes I am. Very expensively. - You look like a street bum. - It's an original. I got it on sale for $1,200. - You spent $1,200 to look like you got no home. - Daddy, you always told me to wear the best. This is the absolute latest fashion. - Yeah. I see. Thank you. Carla, will you excuse us a minute? I gotta talk some business with Vinnie. - Daddy, I'm not a little girl anymore. - We've been hit again. That's the third time this month. I want this bullshit stopped, Vinnie. Take care of it. I don't care how. - Consider it done, Mr. G. - Turn Vinnie loose again, Daddy? - Vinnie's a good man. He's the son I never had. I'm gonna let him have the business someday. Maybe if you and he would get together-- - Yeah, I don't like him, Daddy. He makes me so uncomfortable. - You've been gone a long time. Things have changed. He's not a street kid anymore. He's a respectable businessman. Give him a chance. - Don't start, Daddy. It only leads to a fight. - Eat your dinner. (tense music) - All right, mother fuckers! Wallets, jewelry on the bar, now! - Hey asshole. Tell laughin' boy over there to put the money back and to put the gun down now! (gunshot blasting) (thudding) (grunting) (gunshot blasting) (grunting) (tense music) - You haven't changed in three fuckin' years, Quinn. You still shoot first and ask questions later. - Fuck you, Roark, they had shotguns. - Be nice. I could bust you on two counts of manslaughter. - Self defense and you know it. Don't pull this bullshit on me, Roark. It was a clean shoot, and you got no case. I was protecting my boss' property. I was doing my job. It's what I used to do for this city, protect and serve, remember? - Yeah, and I also remember Internal Affairs getting your ass thrown off your department. Isn't that right, Quinn? - They couldn't bust me so they took the only thing that mattered to me, my badge. Now, are you gonna charge me or not? - Someday you're gonna go too far, Quinn, and I'm gonna put you away for so long, you're gonna forget your own name. Now, get out. - With pleasure. (tense music) - Someday, Quinn. Someday. (traffic zooming) (tense music) (doors thudding) (tense music) (chuckling) - Now, Hector. I want some information. The streets tell me there's some new drug muscle in town. Some guy by the name of Guzman. Raul Guzman. - You think this Guzman's the one who's been hitting our operations? - [Vinnie] Makes sense. Nobody else would be that stupid. - I think we need to educate this Guzman as to whose town this is. - Yes, Mr. G. (tense music) (tense beat music) (gunfire popping) (tense music) (tires squealing) - Well, we'll take care of our end of the agreement. It's a pleasure doing business with you. - Raul, Raul! Somebody just shot Luis and Carlo. There were three of them. They walked in and just started shooting. - What are you talking about? Slow down. - Three men. Hector Rosalez and two others. They walked in to La Cantina. Hector pointed to Luis and Carlo. He ran out the door and then they just started shooting. - Luis? Luis is dead? My nephew is dead? - Yes, Raul. They had machine guns. They caught us off guard. I couldn't do anything about it. I'm sorry, Raul. - Who is this Hector Rosalez? - [Rosa] Street hustler. (grunting) - Miguel, Miguel! You take Rosa and find this Hector. I want him brought to me here, now. Do you understand? Now. And don't hurt him. I want him in one piece. - Si, Senor Guzman. (tense music) (Hector grunting) - [Raul] You are the Judas who killed my nephew. You will tell me who ordered the killings. - It was the Italians. - Gas. - They were trying to kill me. - You should have let him! More gas! Gas. - [Hector] No, no. - Match. (Hector whimpering) Now, you fry in hell. (Hector screaming) Soon, the Italians will join you. I want revenge for my nephew's death. Carlo Giovani will pay for this with blood. (tense music) (thudding) (grunting) - Drop it, drop it! Everybody put your money in the center of the table. (gunshot blasting) Anybody else feel stupid? (tense music) - Do you know who you fuckin' with? L.A. belongs to Giovani. - L.A. now belongs to Raul Guzman. Don't follow us. Adios. (tense music) (gunshots blasting) (moaning) (gunshots blasting) (lovers groaning) (phone ringing) - [Man] Here comes the D.A. - [Woman] District Attorney, do you have a statement? - No comment. - [Woman] District Attorney-- - No comment. Roark. When you came to me with the idea of an organized crime task force, I went to the wall to create it, and I made sure it had one of the largest budgets in the city. Now, it's payback time. What the hell is going on in this city? The gangs and civil unrest are bad enough, without a damn drug war starting. - Miss Hernandez, we're doing everything possible. - Then it's not enough. The press is screaming for my head and the council's screaming for yours and I promise, if the press gets one, the council will get the other. - Well, we think it's some small timer from somewhere in Central or South America. He's trying to take on Giovani and he's the one that started all this mess. - You think? Captain, according to your budget, you had better know! - [Roark] He won't last long. - I don't want him to last at all, do you understand me? - The only way to stop this is to put someone inside of Giovani's operation. - [Hernandez] Then send somebody inside. - It's not that easy. It's gotta be someone Giovani won't suspect. And it's gotta be someone he can check out 40 ways from Sunday and he better come up clean. - Don't we have anybody like that? - Not that'll stand up to Giovani's check. Now, I'm not gonna send one of ours in there to get killed. We need to go outside. (mellow music) (tires squealing) (tense music) (gunshots blasting) - All right come on. Get out, get out. (thudding) (grunting) (wailing) (gunshots blasting) (siren wailing) - [COP] Put your hands up! Come on, keep 'em up where we can see 'em. (chatter on police radio) - My God, Quinn, why in the hell can't you stay outta trouble? - Just lucky I guess. - Get your damn feet off my desk. And why do you always have to leave a trail of bodies everywhere you go? - Easier to follow than bread crumbs. - I oughta let your smart ass mouth rot in a cell, but for once, you did something right. You know who that was they were trying to kidnap? - She was somebody in trouble. I got her out of trouble. - It was Carlo Giovani's daughter. - [Quinn] SQ? - So, what are you saying? You don't know who Carlo Giovani is? - Yeah, I know who Carlo Giovani is. - Damn, we been trying to get someone inside of Carlo Giovani's operation for almost two and a half years now. - So, what do I have to do with it? - We need somebody on the inside. Someone he will know isn't a cop. And now we have a break. - [Quinn] Who? - You. - You're outta your fuckin' mind. - [Roark] Sit down, Quinn! Now, you used to be a good cop! - That was then. Now I work in a bar as a bouncer because I bagged a child molester. - [Roark] Hell man, you killed him with your bare hands! - He was raping a 12 year old girl. I caught the bastard in the act. - [Roark] You went outside the system, Quinn. You didn't even have a fucking warrant. - Her screaming was all the warrant I needed. - Not according to law. - Fuck you. I caught the bastard in the act. He was about to use a whip on her for chrissake. She was 12 years old. The jury said I was right. - They didn't say you were right, Quinn. They said you were justified. But beating a suspect to death never has been and never will be part of this department's policy. You know that. - Quinn's law, Roark. A 12 year old will not be abused by sleaze balls. - No Quinn's fucking law! That's always been your problem, Quinn. You always had to do it your way. - Fuck you, if you don't like it my way, then what the hell you tryin' to get me next to Giovani for, huh? I'm outta here. - Well, Roark. Have you found someone to go undercover? - You just passed him on your way in. - Who? - Jake Quinn. - What makes you think you can get him? - Quinn was a cop. He wants his badge back. Maybe if we can promise to reinstate him-- - I don't care what you promise him as long as you get results. Otherwise, I will find someone else to head up the organized crime task force and you will be back on a beat wearing holes in your shoes. Are we communicating, Captain? (uptempo music) - Quinn, we got some trouble. Get your ass in there. - Look, you little fuck! I want another drink! Now, you gonna get it for me, or I gotta come back there and get it myself? - Quinn. Get this asshole outta my bar. He's too drunk, I cut him off. - Okay, partner, listen. Party's over. It's time to go home, come back some other night. - Why don't you kiss my ass, you fuckin' faggot? (groaning) (thudding) (grunting) - Hello, Quinn. - What do you want, Roark? - Give you a chance to get your badge back and to put Giovani away. - I already told you what you can do with that idea. You want Giovani, get him yourself. - Now look, Quinn. As I see it, you don't have much of a choice. Now, the D.A. wants me to pull the plug on your fucking little ass for that escapade you pulled today. But if you were to say, volunteer for this... - Oh, so let me get this straight. I get my badge back, the D.A. forgets the whole thing, oh, provided that I live long enough to put it back on. - Well. - What if I say no? - She'll very probably hang you by your balls. - On what charges? - Assault, aggravated assault, manslaughter, attempted manslaughter, carrying a concealed weapon, discharging a firearm in the city limits and I'll bet your ass one or two more she hasn't even thought of yet. - Got it all figured out, don't you? - You're damn right I do. - Fuck you, Roark and fuck the both of you. (mid-tempo jazzy music) - Another? - [Patron] Please. - Quinn. - [Quinn] Nick, gimme a drink. - Usual? - [Quinn] Yeah. - [Nick] Hey Quinn, the guy at the end of the bar wants to talk to you. (tense music) - You want somethin'? - Are you Jake Quinn? - Who wants to know? - Mr. Carlo Giovani would like you to join him for dinner at the estate. He will send a car for you. Make sure to wear a tie. (tense music) - Lemme talk to Roark. (phone ringing) - [Roark] Yeah, Roark here. - It's Quinn. Just got an invitation to go to Giovani's house for dinner. - [Roark] Are you gonna do it? - Yeah, I'm gonna do it. But I have two conditions. First, I do it my way. Second, if I come out of this alive, I want compensation for the three years that the department took outta my life. You got that, Roark? - [Roark] Okay. I will work on the compensation part, but you listen to me. Do it by the book, Quinn. Do you understand? Do you-- (tense music) - [Man] Go on in. - [Quinn] Hey driver. This Giovani looks like he's loaded. What does he do for a living? (driver chuckling) - [Driver] Why don't you ask him yourself in a minute? (tense music) - [Vinnie] Come on. Follow me. - Mr. Quinn, you're a hard man to locate. Thank you for coming. - Somehow, I didn't think I had a choice. - Well, really you didn't. This is my father, Carlo Giovani. - Mr. Quinn, pleasure to meet you. This is my associate, Mr. Vincent Scoletti. - We've met. - Please, sit down. Would you care for a drink, Mr. Quinn? - A soft drink would be fine. - Vinnie, get Mr. Quinn a drink. You're a one-man army, Mr. Quinn. - Just got lucky. - Luck had nothing to do with it. It was incredible. I've never seen anything like it before. - I owe you a very large debt of gratitude. How can I repay you? How much? Name any number. - How 'bout a job protecting your daughter? - A job? That's Vinnie's department. - We don't need anybody, Mr. Giovani. - Rocko and Charlie are dead. - Quinn is perfect for the job. - Vinnie, arrange for a meeting tomorrow morning. We'll discuss it then. Is that all right with you, Mr. Quinn? - Yeah, that's fine. - Good. - Dinner is served. - Ah, let's eat. (tense music) Have you got any news on the people that tried to hit Carla? - We're lookin' at every corner, Mr. G. We'll know before the week is out. - [Carla] Hello, Quinn. - [Quinn] Hello. - [Carlo] Quinn, you're prompt. - Something I picked up in the Navy. - Seals, commander. You specialized in small arms and communications. I had Vinnie check ya out. You got an impressive military record, but there doesn't seem to be much on you after that. - I moved around a lot. - Vinnie doesn't think that we need you. - You don't? Well, you daughter does. - Hey, I got enough muscle to take very good care of her. - You don't have any brains. You're not too thorough, are you, Vinnie? Or you'd know I specialize in personal protection, counter-terrorism. You know, if your goons knew what they were doing, I would have never gotten involved. Seems to me someone wants you very bad. You need an expert. - You got a big mouth, Quinn. We don't need you, so take off. - Fine, but the next time they come for her, they're gonna get her. - There won't be a next time, Quinn. So get out, before we have you thrown out. - What's wrong, Vinnie? 'Fraid of a little competition? - [Vinnie] Son of a... Vick, Tony, show me, get the, get him the fuck outta here. (tense music) (thudding) (grunting) (crashing) (chuckling) - I love this Kung Fu shit. - Like I said. All muscle, no brains, no training. You do need me. - Quinn. You're a smart ass son of a bitch, and you're the fastest thing I've ever seen. But can you handle a gun? - Try me. - When I call it, you both draw, fire one clip and reload. Mr. Quinn, I think it's only fair to tell you that Vinnie's never been beaten. Ready. Now! (gunshots blasting) (tense music) Vinnie was a tad faster, but the patterns are both tight. Mr. Quinn. Why did you go for the head? - Cops wear vests. - You're hired. You'll take care of my daughter, but, you'll take your orders from Vinnie. If he says it, I say it, (speaking foreign language)? - Except when it comes to Miss Giovani's safety, then the call is all mine. If I say something, she does it. No questions asked. - Just who the hell do you think you are? You take orders from me. - I'm the one that's gonna take the bullet that's meant for her. (tense music) - Vinnie. Tell Mr. Quinn how things work around here. Put him up in the guest house. - Already got a place, thanks. - Yeah, the guest house. Come on. (tense music) (door thudding) Let's get something straight. I don't know you and I don't trust you. You fuck up just once, and I'll put you in the ground. - [Quinn] Fair enough. (chuckling) - You're on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week, hmm? You don't get off unless I say so. Now, if Carla doesn't need you, you come to me. If I don't need you, well, then you're on your own. You'll get a beeper. You'll wear it every day and if I beep you and you don't answer in five minutes, you are fucked! You got that? - Yeah, I got it. - Take the rest of the day off and have yourself moved in. There's dinner at six in the main house. Be there with a new suit on. See, because Mr. Giovani, he doesn't like his people lookin' like bums. - I think we need to go shopping. Quinn, bring my car around to the front in about 15 minutes. Vinnie'll give you the keys. - Yes, Miss Giovani. - [Carla] Carla. - Yes, Miss Carla. - No, Carla. - Yes, Miss Carla. - Be careful, Quinn. You're just a fuckin' bodyguard. Don't touch. Just guard it. - Oh, I'm careful. That's how I stay alive, Vinnie. (chuckling) - Yeah, that's right. (tense dramatic music) - You upset about something, Vinnie? - I don't like this Quinn. He ain't one of us. - He's damn near as fast as you are with a gun and we don't have anybody with his hands. I need somebody that good to take care of Carla. - I can take care of Carla. - Not all the time. I need you for other things. Hey, stop worrying about Quinn. I need you to find the assholes who tried to kidnap Carla. It's one thing to steal my money. It's another thing to try to take my baby. Now, these mother fuckers, they have declared a war. You understand me? They have declared a fucking war and I want them, Vinnie, and I want them now! You hear me? Now! (tense music) (gunshot blasting) (tires squealing) (gunshots blasting) Thank you. - Sorry I'm late. It's been a long time since I tied a tie. - Don't let it happen again. Sit down. - So, Mr. Quinn. Are you settled in the guest house? Do you like it? - Yes, I do. Thank you very much, Mr. Giovani. - You're welcome. (melancholy music) - What are you doing here? - You saved my life, and I want to thank you. My way. - I don't think Vinnie'd like this. - [Carla] Vinnie hasn't got anything to say about it. And call me Carla. So, what's your first name, Mr. Quinn? - Jake. (slow tempo romantic music) Let me speak to Roark. It's Quinn. - Roark. Quinn. Just where in the hell have you been? Your apartment's vacant, your phone's disconnected. There's a goddamned war going on out there and haven't heard shit from you. - I had to move into Giovani's house. He gave me a job as Carla's personal bodyguard. Yeah, but I gotta be careful. His enforcer's name is Vinnie Scoletti. You know him? He doesn't like me much at all. - Quinn, don't do anything stupid. Scoletti's a psycho. Now, I'll bring you in when I can. Meanwhile, see what you can dig up on this damn war. I'm getting sick and tired of getting my ass chewed by everybody from the mayor on down. - It's good for you, Roark. It builds character. Hey, listen, I gotta get going. - [Carla] Hi there. - [Quinn] Hi yourself. - [Carla] I wanna go somewhere. - Where? - I don't know. Why don't we just get in the car and go? Maybe up the coast or, at least until we find a nice quiet motel. - Carla, I don't think it's a good idea. You know, Vinnie doesn't like me to start with. You know, I think he figures that you two are an item. - Let's get something straight right now, Quinn. I see who I want, when I want and right now, I wanna see you. Vinnie hasn't got a damn thing to say about it. - Does Vinnie know that? - Quinn. Get the car. We're going for a drive. - Yes, Miss Carla. - You son of a bitch.

(engine revving) (tires squealing) (thudding) (patrons chattering) - What the hell is going on, Quinn? Why is everyone after me? - What, you don't really know why? - No, am I supposed to? - It has to do with your father and what he does for a living. - [Carla] What do you mean? - You have no idea what your father does for a living? - For the past 15 years, I've been away in London, first in boarding school and then in college. I haven't been around to know much. What I do know is that my father's a very successful businessman, and a lot people are after his money. - That's not all your father does. He's involved in organized crime. - Look, my father did a lot of ugly things when he was younger-- - No, Carla. Your father's the most powerful mob boss in the country. I mean, he orders peoples' deaths like other people order dinner, and he gets Vinnie Scoletti to carry it out for him. - I don't believe you, so just stop before I start hating you. What my father does is his business. And if it is true, how is it that he never got busted? And how is it that you know so much about my father? - Few years ago, I used to be a-- - Jake Quinn. You're wanted for questioning. - For what? You got a warrant? - Hey look, you can come nice, or we can hog tie you. It's your choice. - [Carla] I'll be all right, Quinn. - The lady says she'll be fine. - It's not the lady's call, it's mine. Why don't you guys just go and come back some other time? - That's it, Quinn. You're under arrest for obstruction of justice. Now, get up and put your hands on the table now. Come on, come on. - Right. (tense music) (thudding) (grunting) Come on, let's get outta here. (tense music) You paged me? - Four minutes, very good. Quinn, I need you to take care of some business for Mr. Giovani. This damn war goin' on, we're behind in collections, and I'm short handed. I want you to collect a couple of debts that are owed. - What about Carla? - Don't worry about Carla. I'll keep her here 'til you get back. - Just make sure you do. You know she's a prime target. (tense music) (uptempo pop music) (crowd cheering) Gentlemen. I'm looking for a guy named Crazy Wayne. You know him? - What do you want him for, man? - He owes my employer some money. You know where he is? - No. - For some reason, I don't believe you. - That's too fuckin' bad, man. - Yeah, it is. - That's what it's gonna cost to talk to us. - No, that's what it's gonna cost for me to stop from kicking both your asses. - Fuck with one of us, you fuck with all of us. (tense music) (thudding) (grunting) - Freeze! Everybody just stand still 'cause right now, I wanna kill somebody and I don't know who. Go ahead, asshole, come on. Give me any reason. Give me any reason to blow your ugly face into next week. Come on. Where's Wayne? (tense music) You bet on football, you lost. You owe my boss some money. He wants it, he wants it now or I'm gonna blow your fuckin' kneecaps off. Now, give me the money. - [Wayne] All right, all right, I got it. - Slowly. (tense music) Thank you for patronage. Remember us the next time you wanna place a bet. Thank you. (tense music) (knocking) - Who is it? - [Vinnie] Vinnie. - What do you want, Vinnie? - [Vinnie] Can I talk to you? - There's nothing to talk about. - [Vinnie] Open the door, Carla. - Vinnie, go away. - [Vinnie] Open the fuckin' door! - All right, just hold on a minute. (tense music) - I thought we could just talk. My God, you are beautiful! - [Carla] Vinnie, Vinnie, Vinnie, don't! - You are beautiful! - [Carla] Hey! - Why don't you lie down? - Vinnie, don't. - [Vinnie] I love you, Carla. I love you, Carla. - Vinnie! - Carla-- (smacking) - [Carla] Get out! (tense music) (thudding) (grunting) - Are you all right? - Yeah, just a little scared. I never thought he'd have the nerve. When Daddy finds out... - Daddy already knows. You son of a bitch! I treated you like my own fucking son and this is how you repay me? Get him outta my fuckin' house! If I ever see your face again, I'll kill you! Get him outta my fuckin' house before I blow his brains out! (tense music) - [Vinnie] I wanna talk to Guzman. This is business. (tense music) - You say you have business to discuss? - You want Giovani? - I'm listening. - I apologize for Mr. Quinn's behavior, but he was only following my orders. - Does that include assaulting two police officers? - They had no warrants. - Well, I do. You're under arrest. - Cooperate, Mr. Quinn. Cooperate. - So, we will take care of all the supply and you will take care of distribution. Now, what about Giovani? That house is a fortress. - I'll take care of security, but the girl is mine. Nobody touches her. - Chrissakes, Quinn, I set that whole thing up at the restaurant to bring your butt in. Instead you leave Stinson and Jones outta commission. - If I'da gone with them, they would have blown my cover. - Well, what'd you have to get rough for? - Hey, I told 'em to back off. They're the ones flashing their badges around. - All right, forget it. What have you got on this damn war? - Not a hell of a lot. Giovani's at war with this guy named Guzman. He's not cartel. He's a new player. He's got a lot of balls, though. Tried to hit Giovani's daughter for the second time. - Yeah, the coroner's tired of cleaning up your messes. - I don't think this is a power play. I think this is personal between Giovani and Guzman. It has all the earmarks of a blood feud. - All I wanna know is how do we stop it? - Arrest them all, hold 'em for their rest of their lives very, very far away from each other. - What are you saying? We don't stop it? - That's right. (buttons clacking) - Vick. This is Vinnie. We're gonna move tonight. Make sure our boys know the plans and are in the house. Where's Quinn? Good. Yeah, the cops'll keep him outta the way. Right. (tense music) - Shut off the gate alarm system. Get the rest of the boys together, and then come up to the house. (tense music) - Oh, you guys. - [Thug] Move it. - Bullshit, fuck. Who are you? You son of a bitch, get that fuckin' thing off of me. (Carla groaning) (Carla mumbling) - [Carla] Get your hands off of me. - [Vinnie] Hello, Mr. Giovani. Hello, Carla! - Hey, how the fuck did you get in my house, you piece of shit. - [Vinnie] None of your fucking business, old man! - [Carla] Bitch. (Carla groaning) (tense music) - Good evening, Senor Giovani. I am Raul Guzman. - Is that supposed to mean something to me? - Perhaps not now, but you see, I am the man behind the incursions into your holdings, shall we say. - Then you're a fuckin' dead man. I'm gonna cut off your fuckin' head and I'm gonna shit in your neck. You fuck with me, you're fuckin' with all the families. You're fuckin' with New York, Detroit, Chicago. - Families aren't gonna do anything. - You rot in hell, Vinnie Scoletti. - Right next to you, Carlo. - Come here. (tense music) (Carlo mumbling) - Come on, you mother fuckers! Come on! You cock suckers! - [Carla] You fuckin' bitch! Ah! Daddy! - [Carlo] You fuckin' psychos. - [Thug] Get over here. - [Carla] Daddy! (Carlo mumbling) - Fucking scaring me! - [Carla] Daddy! - You're not scaring me! (Carla whimpering) I'll kill you son of a bitches! (both hollering) You let her go! - [Carla] Oh, Daddy! - Baby, come here. Let her go! - [Carla] No, no! - Say bye bye to Daddy! - Take me, not her! - Daddy, no! - Get off! - [Carla] No! - Fuck you! - [Carla] Daddy! - [Raul] Get up! Get up! (Carla wailing) - Daddy! Daddy! - Son of a bitches! You bastards! - No! Daddy! No! No! No! (Carla weeping) (tense music) Oh, Daddy, no. (Carla weeping) (somber music) - Okay, Scoletti. We did our part. But you and I have some unfinished business. You killed my nephew. - What the hell are you talking about? I never killed your nephew. - When your men walked into La Cantina and gunned down those men, one of them was my nephew. - Giovani ordered it. Now, he sleeps with the fishes. All debts are paid. - I don't think so. I want Giovani's daughter. - Well, maybe you're right. I do still owe you. Pay the man, boys. (tense music) (gunshots blasting) (Carla weeping) I told you, nobody touches Carla. (gunshot blasting) (tense music) Oh, you got a choice. You can either leave here right now, or you could join me, huh, Miguel? What do you say? - And Rosa, too? - Oh, yeah. If you want her to stay. - Okay. - Okay. Oh, that's good. Oh, you made the right decision. (tense music) (Carla weeping) Jeez, Carla. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't want you to see this. I did it for you. I love you. You know that. But you never looked at me twice, and then this Quinn guy walks into your life... No, I will not lose you. Don't you see? Now we have it all. I'm king of the city, and you're my queen. (spitting) (tense music) (thudding) (gasping) I'm sorry. I am sorry, baby. Vick, Joey. Take her. Let's go. (tense music) - [Quinn] Let me talk to Roark. Hey, Roark, it's Quinn. I'm pulling into Giovani's. Something's wrong. The gate's open, the guards are gone. Lemme check it out. I'll get back to you. (tense music) Carla? Carla? Carla? Get me Roark at OCT. Roark, send a morgue wagon and a forensic team at Giovani's house. I'm comm' 'm. - All right, what the hell happened? - Guzman and his boys grew a lot of balls. They hit Giovani at his house. They got Giovani, but none of them made it out. - So, so, the war's finished? - Not quite. They managed to kidnap Carla. I gotta find her. - You've fallen for her, haven't you? - She was my responsibility. Somebody got to her. I gotta get her back, no matter what it takes. - You turn vigilante on me and I'll stop you. - You can try, but you better not get in my way, Roark, you better not get in my way! - Who the hell you talking to? I can't just let you walk outta here and take the law into your own hands! Listen to me, Quinn. Come back here, Quinn! Quinn! (melancholy music) (tense music) - Guzman and Giovani were wasting their time and money with this stupid war. Well, the war is over! Their time is up. It's time for some new blood to step in there and take over. We're gonna own this fuckin' town, gentlemen. All the drugs, the distribution, the hookers and the gamblers, and nobody will dare to get in our way, or they'll end up like Guzman and Giovani. - Who made you boss? (gunshot blasting) (tense music) - Any more questions, gentlemen? As of now, you're all at double salary. - [All] Yeah. - Now, I want the head of Jake Quinn. I'll pay a hundred thousand dollars for anybody who brings it to me. - Hey, Quinn. Where've you been? - Working as a bodyguard. Get me a beer. (can cracking) (tense music) (gunfire blasting) (victims groaning) - Me and you. Let's see what you got. (tense music) (slicing) (grunting) (thudding) (grunting) - Tell me who sent you. (groaning) Tell me who sent you. (tense music) - [Vinnie On Walkie Talkie] Keep your eyes open. That son of a bitch is gonna show and I want his balls. - Sure, Vinnie, no problem. (tense music) (thudding) (grunting) - [Quinn] Hey, Joey. (grunting) (tense music) (thudding) (groaning) - [Vick] Shit. He's inside, he's inside. (thudding) (grunting) - All right, Quinn. I'm impressed. But you can't touch me. If I don't make it back, the girl is dead. See, if I can't have her, nobody can. - [Quinn] Keep her outta this, Vinnie. This is between you and me. - Fuck you, Quinn. I'm outta here. And you can't do shit. (tense music) (engine revving) (tires squealing) (cart clattering) - [Quinn] Pete, it's Quinn. - I know who it is. - I need some information. - Of course you do. You wouldn't be here otherwise. What do you want? - I'm lookin' for someone. - Vinnie Scolletti. He put a contract on you, 100 grand. Seems he killed Giovani and Guzman. Runs both operations now. - [Quinn] Know where he is? - Might. Then again, might not. What's it worth to ya? - 20 bucks. (Pete chuckling) - [Pete] 50. - 40. - 75. - 100. - 50. - [Quinn] Done. (chuckling) - Don't ever try to cheat me, boy. Yeah, he's set up over in that warehouse on Shiloh. Lot of activity there. You gonna shut him down? - [Quinn] Yeah. - It's safer in southeast Asia. Quinn, you be careful. - Thanks, Pete. (tense music) (cart clattering) (tense music) (thudding) (grunting) (tense music) (screaming) (tense music) - [Quinn] Vinnie! Let Carla go now! - I'll see you in hell first, Quinn. - Welcome to hell, Vinnie. (booming) (tense music) (booming) (tense music) (gunfire blasting) (tense music) (gunshot blasting) Ah! (Rosa yelling) (screaming) (thudding) - Last time you were saved by a girl. This time there's no one to save you. I'm gonna kill you with my bare hands. (tense music) (blades swishing) (thudding) (grunting) - You lose! (cracking) Yah! - Give it up, Quinn! You can't take us all out! - Really? Where's your backup, Vinnie? Give him a call. They're all dead or they split. They don't think you're worth dying for. It's between you and me. (gunshot blasting) - Ah! - Miguel! Rosa! Kill that son of a bitch! - You're all alone, Vinnie! (Vinnie mumbling) - I took out Guzman and Carlo Giovani! I am king of the city! - You're nothing Vinnie but a little chicken shit coward! (gunshot blasting) - Ah! - I still got Carla! You keep fuckin' with me, and I'm gonna kill her. If I can't have her, nobody can. - [Quinn] After she's dead, you still gotta get by me. - Quinn! - [Quinn] Let her go or kill her, Vinnie, 'cause either way, you're goin' down. - You want her? Here! (gunshot blasting) - Ah! (tense music) (tires squealing) (gunshots blasting) (booming) (crashing) (tense music) (melancholy music) - [Quinn] You okay? - [Carla] Why is it you always seem to be saving my life? - It's my job. (tense music) - [Hernandez] Quinn, do you realize that your body count was higher than the whole Guzman-Giovani war? - I guess I win, then. Roark, I think you owe me something. - Your badge. - That was the deal. You gonna keep your word? - Yeah. But you just step outta line one time... Are you listening to me, Quinn? One time and I'll take that back away from you so fast it'll make your head spin. Do you understand? - You know what? You keep it. - What? - You heard me. All that thing ever did was cause me a problem. You keep it. - You'd rather work at a bar? - No, I have a real job, as a bodyguard. You know, Carla, I think it's time we re-negotiated the wages and hours of this job. - [Carla] All right. I think seven days a week, 24 hours a day and no raise. - [Quinn] What kind of negotiation is that? - [Carla] My kind, and on my own terms. - [Quinn] Yes, Miss Carla.
