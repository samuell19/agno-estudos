- Ouch! Oh my god. - Hey. I see you're running every morning. I wanted to know, maybe we can work out one of these days together. - No, thank you though, have a good day. - You too. - Amari, baby, you up? Amari. Get up. Right on time. Good morning, my love. - Good morning. - Happy birthday. How do you feel? - Old. Well, you look the same. - Thanks, Q. Do I smell bacon? - Yes. - Oh. - And French toast. - Oh! - Welcome to the "Dirty 30 Club." - Oh, oh my God. Can I rescind my offer? - No, silly, you can't. I know you wanted pancakes but this is what they had. The rest of the day will go as planned. And that reminds me, I have a list of some things I need you to pick up. Just a few things but I think it'll be good for you to do that. You know, get some air, take shower, put on some clothes, get some exercise in. - Okay. - Oh, guess what? - What? - A driver is coming to meet us at 9AM tomorrow. - To go where? - It's a surprise. I planned a whole weekend getaway for us. Gonna be blast. - Great. - Ah! Shit. Amari, baby, These damn earrings are going to be the death of me. You need to start taking care of your things. What if this were expensive or a family heirloom or something? Luckily, they're fake. - Sorry. - So here's the deal. The caterer will arrive at five, our friends should come for dinner around seven for a party of eight, which will include Sam... and... Glenn, Tess and Shelly and Philip and Serenity. Though they may not show up because, well... Philip asked me to be his divorce lawyer. - Really? - Yeah. Gratefully, they don't have kids, which I think is what this is all about. Serenity not wanting them and lying about not being on birth control when she really was. Phillip's a mess. 12, 13 years. I hope they work it out. - Do we have to have this party? - You only turn 30 once. - I know but there's just nothing to celebrate. - Another year of life is. Another day, another minute, even. - I'm just not in the mood. - Okay. What's wrong? Talk to me. - I just feel like I'm further from my purpose than I want to be. - Purpose, what, what's that? - I don't know. That's my point. - Amari, my point is, you don't have to have it all figured out. Some people search their whole lifetimes for their purpose. - Says a guy who's about to be the youngest partner at his firm at the age of 35. Isn't today the big day? - Mm-hmm, and it hasn't happened just yet. But let's discuss you and your plan after our getaway, yeah? - We could use some fun. - Yes, we could. - At least tell me where we're going. - It's a surprise. You'll know tomorrow morning when the driver comes. - Well, how am I supposed to pack? Is there gonna be a beach? - Yes, it's a whole island. - Q, I don't feel like getting on a plane. - Amari, there's no plane involved. - Just tell me where we're going, please. - Baby, you know I hate keeping secrets from you but this one is one that I have to and that is the plan. - You and these plans. At least tell me there's gonna be bike riding. - Long bike rides up down the beach. All your favorite activities have been organized and scheduled. Ooh. - Thank you. Thank you for making this old man feel good on his birthday, even though I told you not to. - Eat babe. - Hey, Nana. Oh no, I'm good, I'm good. I'm just having breakfast in bed. Thank you. Yeah, he's here. Yeah, he's getting ready for his big interview. Yeah, I hope he gets it too. Nana sends her prayers or whatever. Oh, okay. Here. - Eat, baby. Hi, good morning. How are, uh-huh. Hey look, I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to text you last night, we had a late... Oh, nothing, nothing like that. Yeah. Okay. Well I'll let you know how it goes today, all right? Okay. I'll talk to you later. Love you. Bye. - Yep. Oh. No, nothing yet. Go back to school, Nana, I am in way too much debt already and I don't even want to be a doctor. A dentist? No, I'll figure it out. Yes, I know I'm getting older. Oh. Oh, maybe this card is from you. Nana, no, this is way too much. No, thank you, I appreciate it but this is far too much. Yes, I read the card! Nana, now you know that I cannot believe in anything that I cannot touch or see. Okay. Well, I'm gonna let you go, I'm trying to finish breakfast and I want to get him nice and full, you know? Ew, no, not like that. Okay, all right, I love you too, I'll talk to you later. All right. Bye. - Bye, Nana. - Ugh, she needs to stop worrying about our sex life and focus more on hers. - At least she has one. - Gross. Is that what y'all text about? - Not entirely. - Ew, ew. - If you must know, Nana has some gentlemen suitors. - Oh, I don't even wanna think about Nana getting some or whatever "some" is at her age. - The truth is the truth. - Mmm. Maybe I should become Dr. Amari Lewis. - I mean, it does sound pretty good. You know what sounds even better? Dr. Amari Nichols and Q Nichols, Esquire, partner at Bedford and Brockton. - I can see Nana now. "Look at my boys, the lawyer and the dentist." You know, I am... just like, I only got like a year left of dental school. Maybe I could reapply. But it is super competitive. - It's simple. Decide who you're going to be, then be it. Do it and then you'll have it. Q, partner, that's who I want to be. - Hmm. - So, are we having this party or not? - I mean, you went through all this trouble planning it. I don't wanna disappoint anybody. - I mean, I could let the people know you, you know, had diarrhea or something. Maybe that'll convince them not to show up. - It's very hard to say no to you, Q. - Good. So don't. I have another surprise for you. - Surprise, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I said I didn't want any gifts, any more surprises, I don't deserve it. - It's as much for me as it is for you. I said I wanted to be partner by 35 and partner by 35... and husband and father by 40. I want to spend the rest of my life with you. Will you do me the honor of letting me call you my husband? - We said we wouldn't pop the question on birthdays or holidays. - I know. I bought the ring a while ago. Mexico, really, but then that thing happened and it just never seemed like to be the right time. I was going to do it later on tonight during karaoke and Nana even thought it was a good idea but... - I just need some time. Can I take the day to figure it out? - What is there to figure out unless you don't want to be my husband? - Well, how can I be your husband if I don't have anything to offer you? I have no plan, no job, no purpose. - Amari, a job doesn't define your purpose. - That's easy for you to say. I'm sure you have your whole future and funeral detailed and designed. - I don't have it planned that far. - I don't even have any responsibilities. - You don't take responsibility. - I don't have to pay any bills. I don't even... Ugh. - I can take care of us, I like taking care of us. And if you must know, I have an emergency stash just in case you want to go back to school, dentist. - I haven't even had my teeth cleaned in the last year, I don't even have dental insurance. - Well, if you said "yes", I can put you on my plan. - I don't wanna say "yes" out of convenience. - Say "yes" out of love. There will always be... pits... and peaks... and... I know that I want to go through those pits and those peaks with you. And all I'm asking is that you think about going on those pits and peaks with me. Shit! I'm late. We'll talk about it when I get back. Is that a plan? - Yeah. - Good. How do I look? - Bomb. I've always loved you in pink. - Mmm. Take the day. We'll talk about this when I get back. Oh! Before I forget. These are the few things I need you to pick up from this store. - You said a few items, this is a whole list of stuff. - Responsibility. - Okay. - Now, come on, get up. Let me show you this living room. So, I might have gone all out. I laid out everything. The caterer's gonna set up a table of eight over here, kind of on a diagonal, and then we move the coffee table into the bedroom and then we move this table over when it's time for games, a little karaoke and opening up your presents. Sounds fun, right? Let me know how you're feeling. Use your words, babe. - It's... It's a bit much. - Okay? Well, I'll scale it back when I get home a little later. You like the colors at least, yeah? - Yes, yes, I like the colors a whole lot. I appreciate everything you're doing for me. - You're welcome. You deserve it. Uh-uh. - Well, you better get going. - You're right. Next time you see me, maybe I'll be a partner and your partner. Bye. - Have a good day, love you. - Love you too. Did you just hear that? - Yeah, what was that? - "Stay inside. "There's been an unknown explosion in the area." - Explosion, what kind of explosion? I don't know but I need to call Nana. - I need to call the office. My phone isn't working. - Mine neither. - Oh, I'm scared. - Mmm. Me too. - If you're tuning into this broadcast, God bless you and God bless America. I come to you with tragic news in New York City. An unidentified blast has devastated Time Square. Authorities have yet to confirm the extent of damage or the parties responsible for the attack. Mayor Watts has issued a mandatory lockdown for at least the next 24 hours. We recommend locating your emergency... - What just happened? - I think we lost power. - Oh God. Is this 9-11 all over again? No internet, no food, no power, no phones. And today of all days. How are we supposed to survive? - Do you have a plan? - Who plans for emergencies? At least not this... - Do we have an emergency kit? - No. No, we don't. Should we hide in the closet? - Um. - Maybe we should hide in the closet. She said "attack", right? Was it a bomb, is the air safe? I told you to clean this closet out months ago! I think only one of us can fit. - I think I have, like, a radio or something in here. - Too bad there's so much stuff in there. - Jackpot. - What about our friends downtown? If it was in the other cities, I don't know. Chicago. Nana! - You know, maybe we should just focus on us right now. Perhaps you should just... pray or meditate or whatever woo-woo thing you do to keep yourself calm. - Okay, you're right, you're right, you're right. You're right. Breathe. Be grateful. - We need batteries. Maybe in the kitchen? - Yeah. What kind of batteries do we need? - Double A. - How many? - Four. - Found one. - Me too. - The TV remote uses double A, right? - Yeah, good thinking. - See? We make a good team. Come on. Father, we come before You as Your humble servants, God. We pray for strength, we pray for courage. We pray for our family and our friends, our colleagues, the first responders, God. We pray that these batteries work, Jesus. Please, Lord. - Yes. - Amen. Woo. - Get a signal. - Who would do such a thing? Who would hurt so many people? Woo. - Like Nana always says, "Man plans, "God laughs." - This is not an act of God. It's an act of terror. - Okay, all right, let's not jump to conclusions. Let's just focus on finding a working station. - Luckily I was running late. I would've been stuck down there and underground with the rats in the dark. Away from you-- - We cannot take any moment for granted. - On your birthday. - It can all be gone in a second. Let us take a moment of silence to honor the fallen. And we can now confirm that there have not been reports of similar activities in other cities around the world. - Oh! Thank you, God. - Emergency workers are on the scene. They are examining-- - Hey, can you cut that out a bit? - What? - All that God stuff. It's annoying. - When did you become an atheist? - I just wanna deal with what's real! - God is real. The Creator, whatever you call "it", it's very real. - Q, I get that you have this need to ground yourself in this idea of hope but it isn't helping us. We don't even know what's going on outside the door. There's other things to worry about like food, water, supplies. I can't deal with this. - You never wanna deal with anything. You always jump ship when it's time to do something, to finish something. Say something! - But like you said, if I need to be something, I need to do something. - So be it then. - What I won't be is this version of me you have inside of your head. I am exhausted to living up to your impossible standards. - What the fuck are you talking about? - It always has to go your way. - Really? - The way that you planned. - Okay. Wow. - It's suffocating. - Really? So why haven't you said anything all these years? - You aren't the most open to other people's opinions. Always so quick to criticize, especially me, if I'm not in alignment with your plan! - Baby, we're on the same team. I only want what's best for you. - What's best for me is you not down my throat all the time. - I thought you needed that. - We're in the middle of a crisis. - Don't just walk away! - Can I have some space, please? - Here's your space. Too bad there's not much of it because you don't wanna let go of shit. How do you expect to invite new things if you keep on holding on all of this stuff? Do you need this? Or this? Or... This? - You're being outrageous. - I'm passionate about this, about us! - All right, you can have the living room. I'ma take the bedroom. - There's an attack happening outside and you want space? That doesn't make sense. Am I enough for you, Amari? - Q, I just don't wanna fight right now. - Do you wanna be with me? - I don't want to fight right now, Q. - Fight for something. - All I'm asking for is to go into that room and have a moment to catch my breath. That's all I'm asking for. Begging for. - Whatever. I'll make it easy. - Nothing is ever easy with you, Q. - If I die out here, know that I loved you to death. Fuck! I can't remember the last time we did anything adventures. - Um... Mexico. But we both know what happened next. - That's why I planned this whole evening, this weekend. Now it's ruined by terrorists. - I haven't been completely honest with you. - About what? - I've been feeling lonely. - Oh, well, me too. But I'm here. I've been here. - This just hasn't been the best year for me, for us. I know it's my fault we're in this pit. - No, it's not. I mean... It's no one's fault. - Yes it is. I haven't been feeling like doing much of anything. - Part of me feels the same way. - What's wrong? - I'm frustrated. - About? - About us. Something changed in Mexico. We haven't been the same since. - Yeah, I know. We've been stuck in this routine. - Are you happy? - I have my moments. - No. Are you happy with me? - Q, I love you and nothing's ever gonna change that. - Answer the question. - Yes. I'm happy with you. Are you happy with me? - Besides my friends, you are all that I have. But I'm not happy in this pit that we're in. - We will climb out of this pit. Together. Why don't we have some fun? Maybe play a game? - Do you think now is the best time the games? - What else are we gonna do? - I mean, it is your birthday. Probably won't be having this party after all. - Good. It's just what I wished for, to spend this moment with the person I love the most. So you and I are gonna play "Memories". - Memories? - Mm-hmm. So there are two photos of specific moments of our time together. - Mm-hmm. - Gonna shuffle them up and then spread them out, face down, and the first person to get the most matching pairs wins. What do I get when I win? - If you win. Get whatever you want. Winner's choice. - I like that. To raise the stakes, when we locate a memory, we have to recall the peak of that memory. - Oh, the highs. What about the lows? - We just focus on the good. - Okay then. Let's play. Oh, bop, bop, bop, bop! Rock, paper, scissors. - Best out of three? - Russian Roulette. - I love your style. - So why now? Why me? - I love you. - It's gotta be another reason than love that would make you wanna marry me. - Amari, look at you. You're gorgeous. I mean, I love other things too. - Like what? - When you're like this, fun, playful. I asked you now because I want you to know that I'm here for you, in the highs and the lows. - I just feel that you're so attached to this vision of being married by 40. - That's not true. And I know what I want. - Ooh! I remember this one. This is when we went hiking upstate and we got lost but we worked together to retrace our footsteps to get back to camp. - A bear chased us through the forest. - That was Alvin, a chipmunk. - I remember Smokey the bear. Now you can remember what you want to, and that's fine, I still have nightmares about that damn trip out in the wild. Definitely a pit. - Oh, whatever, there was no bear. - Ooh. - Okay. - Aw. - Ooh. - I remember this trip. - You picked me up and we drove to Atlantic City for my birthday. - Mm-hmm, lucky number 33. - Won a thousand dollars. - And gave it back to the casino. - You know I love gambling. I remember we ate real good that night. - I don't remember what we had for dinner. I just remember that we shared plates and we had those chocolate chip cookies for dessert. - Oh yes. With the sea salt sprinkled on top. Ooh. - Mmm. - Shit, I'm hungry now. - There's oatmeal. - Ugh, I hate oatmeal. - I know. I'm just playing. - That would suck. My last meal. Oatmeal. - Beggars can't be choosers. - I'd rather eat you. - Oh. I don't think I could curve your appetite. - Think you could curve something else. - Ew, stop. - Give it to me. - You were trying to distract me. Quit. - Call it what you want. - Mmmm. Only one pair left. - How many do you have? - Six. - I have six too and it's my turn. This one's for the win. - Mmm. I remember this one. - I'd rather not. - Oh, it's all right. It was Cancun and I was sick for three out of four days on this trip. I was shitting and throwing up left and right. - Yeah. - What's wrong? Ugh. What's wrong? Come on. - I cheated. - Oh baby, the game is over. Come on. - In Mexico. I cheated. - It was the guy at the front desk, wasn't it? Ugh. - It was a mistake. A lapse in judgment. - I was wondering why he was being so friendly to you when I was being wheeled out the front door by the bellman. You said you was gonna propose me on that trip. - I know, I should've told you sooner. - What stopped you? - You've been in such a bad mood. - We went to Mexico over a year ago. - And you've been disconnected from me ever since. - And now I know why. Damn. - There's something else. - Shit, the bomb's already dropped. If you got anything else to say, you might as well let it out now. - I'm positive. - Am I at risk? - We always use protection and we haven't been doing much of that anyways lately. And I wouldn't have sex with you until I knew that I was undetectable. - And that makes it okay? I can't even look at you right now. What else you been keeping secret from me, Q? - I should be asking you the same damn question! - Oh, so no I'm on the stand? - You haven't been Mr. Perfect. - I haven't tried to be and I also didn't break any of the boundaries that we set! - I peeped your DMs. - Oh, Q, please, you sound so stupid. - Oh yeah? I have receipts. - So let me get this straight, defendant. You cheated on me over a year ago and then you decide to pull out this bullshit ass evidence as a way to do what? Make up for what a fucking mess you are? - "You're so cute. "Oh, we should hang out sometime. "Maybe you should ask your boyfriend." - Q, you are reaching. We agreed to break up with each other before cheating. - It just happened, I didn't plan it. - That's a fucking surprise, you plan everything else. Oh, wait. It must have been an emergency. - I need space. - If we weren't on lock down, my ass would be out that door. - And where would you go? - Anywhere but here. - See how far that $300 takes you. - Fuck you. - Amar. Amari, open up, please? Please, baby. Don't shut me out. Amar, baby. Baby, please. - What do you want me to say? - Say anything. - There's nothing more to say. - Is that it? - What did you expect? A whole year? - This is too much. And cheating was always a deal breaker. - Fight for us. For me. Please. - Ding, ding, ding. That's a K.O, Q. - Give me a chance, I'm gonna make it right. Baby. - How are you going to do that? - I don't know, I don't know but I'll try. - You should journal about it. - Okay. We've been drinking, we've been smoking. - I am very clear. - So that's it? Are you really throwing in the towel? - Come on, baby, we gotta lose these extra pounds we put on in Cancun. - You left five of them in Mexico. - That's okay. I am here for moral support. - I'm tired. - Come on, we're almost to our spot. - Babe. Oh, geez. Fuck. - Are you okay? - Yeah. - My clumsy boyfriend. Do I need to call the paramedics? - Maybe. Kiss it. Make it better. - There's nothing wrong with you. You should have been a performer instead of a lawyer. - Oh, my entire job is performing. - So do you want your Oscar now or later for being a divorce lawyer? - Now. Tomorrow's not promised. - Ooh, let's take a picture. - Hey, we do you need to talk about something. - One second, babe. This is the perfect moment. Yes. Oh. Hold on, this is work. Hey. Hey, Tim, how's it going? Yeah, I'm back. Well, Q had more fun than I did. Yeah, I was sick for most of the trip. I am better now, thank you for asking. Oh, okay. Really? What about the promotion? Okay. No, I understand. Thank you. I appreciate that. Okay, yeah. I'll see you tomorrow. - Everything okay? - They cut my position and they're letting me go. - Babe, I'm so sorry. They were just promoting you to director. - "This is a hard time for the company." - You okay? I'll be fine. This isn't the first job I lost. - You didn't like it there anyway. - I like the money. - There are other jobs out there. We'll figure something out. Until such times, let daddy take care of you. - Oh, Daddy. Not gonna worry about it today. - Okay. - Today is fun. - Okay. - I'll worry about the rest tomorrow. - Okay. - Was there something you wanted to tell me? - I was gonna ask you, had you considered photography? - Eh. I take pictures for fun. - Uh-uh. You really have a great eye. Can't nobody capture a moment like you. - Mmm. Memories and moments. - Wanna hit this? - I didn't say come in. - I know, I'm sorry. I got oatmeal. The gas is back on, good news. So I was able to boil some water. There's some rice and beans in there, if you'd like that. - I'm not hungry. - I heard your stomach from out there. - What kind is it? - Peaches and cream. - Thanks. - Can we maybe pretend to be friends? - I don't wanna play this game. - Would you play something else? - Like what? - "The Vulnerable Truth". - Sounds boring. - I thought of different questions. Some we may know the answer to, some we may not. But I figured we'd pull them in hopes of getting to an honest answer. - I think we've had enough honesty for one day. - Okay. - This was not an act of terror but a group of transformers that exploded in the subway causing a chain reaction and massive blast. It's going to be some time before authorities are able to remedy the situation and restore power across the city. Cell service for some carriers had been restored. Police are confirming-- - Of criminal activities across the city. The lockdown is still in effect. Stay inside and stay alive. - I finally did it. I had oatmeal. - It was gooey but good. - Told you oatmeal's the bomb. - I know, I should have listened, I know. - I'll play your stupid game with you... after I shower. - Thanks for trying. - Don't say anything. - Hi, Amari. Long time no see. - Hush. - I'm serious. You look so... handsome. - Thanks. All right, so how do we play this game? - You just have to pull some questions out of the candle. - "What are you most afraid of?" - Losing you. - Honestly, I don't think that part of our relationship can be saved. - Can we try counseling? Would you be open to it? - We're playing your game, questions only from the candle. - "If you can change one thing about me, what would it be?" - Your breath be stank. - I talk a lot. - That is no excuse. Have a mint handy, some gum, something. Don't no one want hot air in their face. - Why didn't you tell me before? - I just noticed it. And I didn't wanna hurt your feelings. - I'm not fragile. - Mmm. Okay, well then maybe you should go get that checked out. Hope it's not halitosis - Gross. I hope not. - These are dumb questions. "What's your favorite thing about me?" - Well, I love how you're able to see things in pictures. How you're able to capture the perfect moment. - Memories are moments. Thanks. - Speaking of, may I present you with a gift? - Uh-uh. No. - It's from Nana and I. - I see what you're trying to do. - We thought you could use some inspiration. Get the creative juices flowing. - Oh, Oh. Everybody's a photographer these days. - People can snap a picture for the gram but not everyone can capture a moment, a memory, that lasts a lifetime. - Wow, this... This is really awesome. Take it for a spin. - Oh. There's so many buttons. Ah, oh, I don't even know what I'm doing with this thing. - You'll figure it out. Practice makes progress. - Mmm. This is too much. - Don't worry about it. - Nana is on disability, Q. She shouldn't even be sending me money. - It's a gift. Accept it. May I at least model for you? - Go stand over there. Go. Now, look away from me. Mmm. Yes. Okay, now turn towards me and just touch your... You know what? Hmm? Oh. Yeah Look up at me. Yes. Now give me one with a smile. - Even though my breath stank? - Remember when I used to tell you corny jokes just to make you laugh? - I remember. - What do you call a pig that does karate? - A pork chop. How about, why shouldn't you write with a broken pen? - Because... it's pointless. - Those are good. You're a professional. - Thanks. - Can we pass? - Your game, your rules. - What do you love about me? - I love... how dedicated you are. When you put your mind to something, you can do anything to get your mission accomplished. I think the reason we work so well is because I have great ideas... and... you... are a great executor. - Is there anything I can do to fix this? Tell me. You know I will do it. - I know. But I don't think we're something that can be fixed. - I remember the first time we met. - I was working at that boutique hotel in Harlem. And you were sitting at the bar on a date with some other dude. I should have known then. - I was not on a date. We were out having drinks and he was a lawyer and not even my type. - I asked you if you wanted another round. - And you brought me the wrong drink. - I didn't charge you. - I wrote my number on the back of that receipt and told you to text me, you did. And the next night we went for Cuban food. We've been chained together ever since. - "Chained" is a good word for it. - It wasn't all bad. - I wanna remember the good stuff. I'm sorry you went through all that by yourself. - I'm sorry I didn't tell you. I hadn't told anybody. - It's nothing to be ashamed of. - I'm not. Not anymore. Final pull? - "If you could be any place in the world right now, "where would you be?" - I... I wouldn't be any place but here... with you, my best friend. - I think we're gonna have to take some time before we can be friends. If we can be friends. - I understand. I just want us to be something. - Me too. - Is there anything you've been not completely honest about, like a secret online dating profile, late night bathroom hookups? - There... There is something that I haven't told you. - You hypocrite. - It was not sexual but... I have withheld information. - Withholding is lying. - So... when I went to the doctor to see if there was anything wrong with me mentally, they did a full of physical and... found some abnormal cells. - Abnormal cells, do we need to get a second opinion? - It turned to be nothing, that's... They're gonna monitor it over time, I'm fine. But it could potentially become... prostate cancer. - Amari! - I didn't say anything because I didn't want you to overreact. Like I said, potentially, and I'm fine. So three months ago. - Is that why you've been avoiding having sex with me? - The doctor said that... anal sex doesn't make the cells grow but... I can't stop thinking about it. - I guess we do have to try something different. - Are you open? - Always open for you. - We could have... discussed... your needs to explore. - I wasn't exploring. I didn't even wanna go on that damn trip. - I thought getting away was gonna be good for you. - It wasn't. It felt like my Nana's death meant nothing to you. - That was never my intention. - I never got to be completely honest about me. About us. - Amari could sound like a girl's name. - She stopped asking about you after I kept on making up so many excuses why you could never make it to Houston. - She loved you... regardless. - Yeah. Hope so. Just wanted to make her proud, you know? - Q, look at all the things that you accomplished. She was very proud of you. - Have the apartment for a few months. I'll go stay with Glenn. - No. I'm gonna go back to Chicago for a little while. Spend some time with Nana. - She's too much. Can't believe she made a comment that we should be making home videos when she realized the camera shot videos. - Yeah, she's crazy. But I love her. - That's what connected us instantly. The fact we were both raised by our grandma. - Yeah, Nana's Boys. - What are we supposed to tell our friends? - Tell your friends... whatever you feel comfortable sharing. - I let you down. - Q, that's the thing, you try so hard to be liked by everybody and have everything go according to plan. If we learned anything today, it's that life is lived through instant moments, not prolonged plans. Thank you for the camera. - You're welcome. It just... can't wait... and expect life to happen in the snap of a moment. You do need a plan. - You're right. - Trust in something greater than yourself. - Okay, you don't have to preach to me. - Why are you so resistant anytime I bring up the Creator? - Because I don't have the energy to have faith in the idea of something. - Faith is confidence in yourself and your abilities, your intuition. - And what was your faith in us in Mexico? I thought so. - You gotta believe in something bigger than you. Something. You always get defensive whenever I question you about anything. - Q, if I walked outside that door right now and got mugged, is that God? - No, that's man. He's attached to chains of lack. That's why there's systems of oppression at place. - Q, you are part of two of the biggest systems of oppression that exist, marriage and laws. - I like the passion but tell me more of the argument. - Q, you can't force your ideas of this subject on me. - You know the difference between religion and spiritually? - No, but I got a feeling you're gonna tell me. - Would you be open to meditating? - I don't even know where to start. - I'll show you. - What you doing? - Just cleaning out the space, inviting new possibilities. - I can't. This is too woo-woo for me. - Sit down. Embrace the fact that change is the only constant. It might be scary or painful but... we have to... go through it. - All right. So, be open to whatever thoughts come up. Just observe and release them as they come. - Okay. - I wanna start by sitting in silence. Five minutes. I hope my breath don't stink. - I don't smell anything. - Good. All right. - Breath is the most important thing. It's all the evidence that we need to know that we matter... that we're alive. - This is pretty easy. Maybe you should be a woo-woo instructor. - Maybe. - Okay, what's next? - Just... sit. The goal is to quiet the mind so that we can hear our intuition, connect to the heart center. Whenever you're ready, wiggle your fingers and your toes. Bring life back into the body. Flutter your eyes open. I've been saving this for a special occasion. Red, black or blue? - Red. - Write your heart out. Happy birthday. - Thank you. - Oh, can you hand me the rice and beans, please? - Yeah. You know, you really do make the best rice. - Nana taught me well. - I'd hate to lose her too, you know. - You know, separating from me doesn't me you separate from her. She has to make her own decisions. Don't. - What? - What are you doing? - Gotta learn sometime. - Trying to steal my recipes. - Recipe. You only have one. - You wanna know how to make rice? - Mm-hmm. - The trick is, put the seasons in first before you add the race. Go ahead, open that. I'll get it started. I really had fun tonight. You been practicing that song. - I had big plans for that song. Oh, look at God! Oh. - Oh. - I'm sorry, babe. - Well, He did say, "Let there be light." Good night. - Good night. - Hey. - Hey. - What time is it? - 6:30. - Ooh, it's early. You don't have to go. I can sublease a spot and take care of the bills here until you get on your feet. - Luckily, this is not a divorce you have to settle, Q. - Keep that for emergencies. - I don't need it. - Can I give you one more gift? - It's not my birthday anymore. You were born at 5:49 on the 29th of September, so technically it is your birthday, if we're being technical. - Thank you, ooh. Morning breath. You should work on that. Now. - Remember that surprise getaway I had planned for us? You should go. A car has been arranged to depart from here to take you to an all-inclusive, adults only resort in Martha's Vineyard. Everything has already been paid for. And I would really hate to lose that money. Please. I know it's one of your dream places to visit. - It's really hard to say no to you, Q. - Happy birthday. - Thank you. Can I open this later? - Yeah, it's cool. - Thank you. Seriously. - This no contact, no following thing. How will I know when it's time to reconnect? - I'll reach out to you. - You sure you got everything you need? Small bag. - Got everything I need. - I never thought it would end like this. - Endings just happen, but they happen so there can be a new beginning. Please make this easier on us. - Keep this. - I am going to go on this trip and you are gonna pay for it. - Well that makes me happy. - Isn't that what you want? It's time to let go of me. This idea of me, the plan, all of it. - Amari? - Q. - Rock, paper, scissors? - Hey, Nana. I left you a voicemail. Yes, we're good. Guess what? I am going to be home on Monday. No, I'm coming by myself. Well, he did but I said no. Oh, is he? Interesting. Well, call me back. I love you.
