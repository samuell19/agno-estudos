In less than 24 hours, I'll be dead. I don't know it yet. That's why I'm talking like this. I'm the only one standing behind a fence, watching the parade race by. Then it's gone. I don't believe in love. STARCROSSED Subrip: Pix Baby, can you zip me up? I... I talked to the travel agent this morning. Bora Bora, one week. You and me. I don't need that. No. Come on. I don't want that. You're mine. You're mine. I know you're trying hard to hold it all together. Look. It takes time. This is... It's a process. Doesn't happen overnight. Just don't do anything irrational. I gotta go. The company can't lend you anything else right now. We need to keep our current staff afloat. I don't wanna lose anyone. I'll manage, Laz. I always do. Hell, you can tell Lucy, in reality it's her father that's pressing this. I'm sure she can help you sort it out. Let's talk tomorrow. You know, I've never worked in all my life. In all my life, I've never worked. I've been thinking about that. What did you say? I didn't say anything. You did too. You said I was very fond of expensive things... Furs and jewels and things. Did I say that? I guess you and I have been, more or less, used to... a life of pink champagne. Could you? Anthony. You all right? Yeah. I'm fine. My father says he's been trying to Get a hold of you. Says you haven't returned his calls. You know, I hate talking business with you two. I'll call him. Thank you. Talked to Nathan today. He's excited about tomorrow. Dance with me. -We have to go. -No, no. We have to go. I'm gonna take my own car. I'm gonna have drinks with Valerie after. Fucking dick! Thanks. Is, this seat taken? Well, it's fate. I don't believe in that, but I'll take the seat. Pity. Scotch, please. Miss? You can't smoke in here. Sorry. Come on. What's your name? I'm called Kat. Ben. Rawlins. You don't look like a Ben. It's a middle name. I will not release this into your custody... until you tell me. It's just gonna go out. Then I'll just wait until you light another one. Letholdus. Now, that... That sounds like a middle name. It doesn't sound like any kind of name. Well, I smell a story. Letholdus was the first knight over the wall of Jerusalem in the first crusade. So it's noble. No one calls me that. Why not? I don't know. Why are you so interested? You know, it's strange. We're out here listening to the world go by, and we know there's people out there, even though we can't see them. I always wonder what their story is. I'm still curious why no one calls you that. Fine. I'll find out sooner or later. Wait. You've got an eyelash. Make a wish. Quickly! Guys, you can't smoke out here either. I'm not... We're not smoking. Dude. I used to dance to this when I was little. It always used to make me feel so free. I don't feel that way anymore. So, what are you then? What would you find more enticing... The answer or the mystery? To mystery. Cheers. Another one? Yeah, please. I'm gonna start charging you for those. I don't pay for things. Another piece of the puzzle. I wouldn't try to solve me. Come on. Everybody wants someone to solve them, don't they? Not me. Why not? 'Cause everything important gets taken away. Good evening, sir. Ma'am? Could I get something started for the two of you? Gin with tonic and your driest Pinot Noir. Right away, sir. Hello. You know him? You remember Bailey Steinfeld. It's her cousin, Ben. From Kentucky. She wanted me to show him around the city, so it's the least I could do. Nice to meet you, Ben. Nice to meet you. I don't hear an accent. We... We moved around a lot. Aren't you going to introduce me? -And you are? -I'm Kat. Maddox. Kat's Rommel Lazarus's niece. Yes. My mother's his sister... Lily. We were just gonna go, get a table and have a drink. Why don't we join you? Sure. -Here you are, ma'am. -Thank you. Sir? Gin and tonic. Enjoy. Waiter. You can call me Gerry, sir. Gerry, this has too much tonic in it. I asked for gin with tonic. "With" means 10% tonic. -So sorry. -A real drink. -I'll fix it right now. -A man's drink. Do you understand? Yes, sir. You don't need to do that. Look, I know what I want. And now he knows what I want. Now he's gonna get it for me. Alright you don't need to talk to him like that. Was I wrong, Ben? Was I wrong? No, you were not wrong. Here you are, sir. Gin and tonic. Ten percent. Perfect, Gerry. So, how did the two of you get thrown together? Well, he was gallant. Rommel. Someone's actually named that? I thought I had a bad name. What are you talking about? Your name is Benjamin. Well, no, it's not. Erwin Rommel. He was a Nazi field general. Considered to be the most humane and ingenious of his kind. Still a Nazi though. I'm going to go to the bathroom. Excuse me. Yeah. I have to use the restroom too. If you guys will excuse me. My shift ended. Have a good one. Have a good night, man. Really? You okay? You know, I have this theory. You can tell a lot about a person when you see them standing alone. That right? I learned a lot. About? I don't think I should tell you. Go on. Tell me. You're hiding something. A secret. Maybe more than one. The trick is, you've learned to hide the hiding. You know this based on what exactly? Well, it takes one to know one. You wanna get out of here? Me and you. I mean, it's just... It's kind of a lot to handle right now. You wanna just... cut out maybe? I can't. Don't leave me alone with them. We were getting ready to send out a search party. Ben and I were just saying, it's about to get busy in here. Maybe we should just continue this at your place. Our house? -Lucy's meeting someone later. -I can cancel. Ben. What do you say? I'm sure he has somewhere better to go. Actually, I don't. Nothin' better at least. Anthony, why don't you take Kat, and Benjamin will ride with me. I want him to see the city at night. Shall we? I'll get the check. Who is she? I don't know. If you ever... I swear to God... -I... -What? I'm sorry. I'm just happy that you're here. I don't believe you. In my house? You better not say anything to her. Nothing. You promise me. Promise. You've a beautiful home. Thank you. We're very comfortable here. It's been in the family for years. Please... sit down. Make yourself comfortable. Anthony, darling. Why don't you make Ben a drink? We should, just stay here. Nonsense. Just make him the... Perfect drink. Kat? Will you join us? I'm fine here. Benjamin? Is this your son? That was taken in Jackson Hole a few summers back. Sweet face. That was preschool. Are you a cognac man? Not really. This one. You have good taste. This was bottled before my father was born. It cost me $77,000. It's not polite to talk about the cost of things with company. Lucy would say that. It's funny. That a thing so rare can be so insignificant. Do you have a family? No, not really. You? You got kids? Yeah. We adopted a son, Nathan. He's away at camp. Have you been enjoying my wife? What was that? Lucy. She's showing you the city, right? Yeah. Yeah, she has. How do you like it? The city. I tend not to stick around anywhere too long. See, I'm just the opposite. When I have something, I can't let it go. I stay too long. Funny accident how we all found each other tonight. Should... Should we head back? Ben has great taste. The '29. Lucy was just telling me about your son. He's learning how to play tennis. Is he? He's very athletic and he's so smart. -Ladies? -Cheers. Benjamin? Thanks. Nazdarovya. Nazdarovya. To a good night. So is he here? Your son. Is he sleeping? Should we be quiet? -Actually... -Lucy. Can I talk to you? Okay. -Now. -Excuse us. We'll be just a minute. Why are you doing this? So rude. What are you doing? I want to smoke. What if this is my last one? Well, then I'd take it from you. What's your fantasy? There you are. Well, what is it? To be free. Of what? I don't know. What's yours? To die young. You didn't really mean that, did you? What are you doing? What are you doing? You're not coming in? I... I just wonder where they went. You really care? No. I just... They could be fucking. No. They haven't in months. He told me. He told you that? I just think... I don't... People's private lives should stay private. See, that's your problem. You want everything to be like a dream. But it's not a dream. Sex is sex. Fucking is fucking. Don't be such a prude. I'm not a prude. You afraid to jump? I'm not a prude. So, where does she keep you? What? Where does Mrs. Bishop keep you? I know you don't work. I'm a writer. Right. I am. Have I read any of your work? 'Cause I read everything. I was published. How long ago? Four years. So you don't work. I'm not judging. You're imagining things, Kat. I can smell one of my own kind. Don't. It's not like that. Why? Why not? Some writer. You're with a married man. -It's more complicated than that. -Is it? Is it? What is it, like some kind of act or something? It's all an act, Ben. We give people the versions of ourselves they need to feel safe. I give him what he needs, so he gives me what I want. What does that mean? It means he pays for my life. For all of it. So you're a whore. Don't do that. No, say it with me. Say it with me. "I'm a whore." You're one to talk. Lucy's showing me the city. I bet. So, where does he keep you? Where does he keep his whore? A loft in the marina. Your turn. Why should I have to tell you anything? Because I can't stand a liar, and I liked standing you. Downtown. She keeps me downtown. I like we're being honest. Honest? Back there... Things are getting quite serious, aren't they? Let's go look around some more. I don't wanna look around. You're beautiful. Sometimes dirty things have a kind of beauty. This can't lead anyplace. I know. Now that I've found you, I don't want to let you go. We really should get back downstairs. Anthony? What? Are you listening to me? Yes. Where did you get this? What? This bra. I don't think I've ever seen you wear it before. What's this? This... is a tattoo. Come on. It's... It's the name of a song that my father would sing me when I was a kid to put me to sleep. "Szerelem." It, means "love" in hungarian. Well, what's the song say? It's in hungarian. Tell me your favorite part. Favorite part is... "I would do anything for my old lover. I would dip the water of the sea. I would pick shells from the seabed, and I would sew a wreath for my old lover." Tell me about him... Your father. He was, you know, the strongest man in the world to me when I was a kid. You know how you think when you're a kid. He was... He was a superhero to me. You know, my book was about my parents. Tell me about your mom. My mother... passed away when I was seven. It crushed my father. It devastated him. He... He lost it... all that... That strength that made him great. And I watched it all melt away when I was a kid. He would cry to me. He would cry to me, a seven, eight-year-old kid. And he'd be sobbing, telling me how much he missed her, how much he needed her. I wouldn't know what to say. You know, why would... How would I know what to say? And everyone else, they were telling him that it wasn't his fault, that she was just an unhappy person. But... he wasn't hearing it. He took the full weight of it. He blamed himself. You know, I remember having the distinct thought that... how is anything in the world... worth that much pain? And from that point on, you know, he... It was like he had two different lives. There was the life while my mother was alive, and there was the life after. Whatever it was, I stayed in this life. Letholdus. I was supposed to see him today. But you didn't? Tell me something about your parents. Your family. Don't. Come on. Come on. All right. This sounds like Stravinsky. We danced to Stravinsky on our wedding day. Why's that so important? I used to love Stravinsky. Dance with me, Mrs. Bishop. So that's why we're here. I remembered us. I remembered the day. Can't a man love his wife? Anthony, you can't just change everything back the way it was because you want to. All this... what we have... Is nothing. You're nothing. What are you doing? You act like a cunt, then I am going to treat you like a cunt. Stop... Stop it! No! Get out! What? You gonna swap me out for the boy? He's more of a man than you. Fuck. You get up. Get up! Fuck you. Get up! What, are you gonna shoot me? Go ahead. Go ahead and shoot me. Wait. Stop! You didn't want to dance with me, so you're going to dance for me. Do you understand? Come on. Yeah. Harder. Harder! That's right. Yeah. Harder. Harder. Fucking harder. Fuck. Yeah. That's right. Now turn around. Please. Please. Please. Please. Please. Please. Please. Baby, please. I'm sor... I'm sorry. Anthony. Yeah, hi. Hi. I need a cab as soon as possible. Yeah. 54 Alighieri Drive. Thirty minutes? Thank you. Thank you. Hey, Laz. It's-It's Lucy. I-I really need to talk to you. Can you come by later? I got a cab. I told you... I can't. You've gotta stop running at some point. You pigeonholing me? I mean, what are you doing here, Kat? Why are you with this guy? You don't know what you're talking about. I know you're better than this. You're better than what he makes you into. There you two are. Everything okay? Benjamin, would you excuse us? What's going on? Nothing. I know you, Kat. You don't do nothing. Where were you? You fucked him, didn't you? No, say, "No, Anthony, I didn't fuck him." He can hear you. That's not an answer. Anthony, don't... Kat. I need you. What about what I need? I give you everything. No, you don't. You give me nothing. Not what I want. I'm your whore. That's all. Please. Give me what I want. I don't have him. He's not here. You were gone a while. Did you get lost? Not... Lucy, not right now. Anthony might see. Anthony doesn't see anything. You remember our story? I would do anything for you. You know that, right? Anything. Anything you want. You took care of me. You took care of me. You want her. What? What? No. Then why... why'd you tell her your name? What are you talking about? Your real name, Ben. Your real fucking name. -You told her. -What are you... Chill. Don't you fucking... Don't you fucking tell me to shut up! What's gotten into you right now? You are mine. I will take what is mine. -Will you fucking tell me the truth? -Calm down. Stop. What are you doing? Just tell me the truth! Anthony, Laz is here. What is he doing here? I'm gonna take care of it. What did you do? I can't believe you called Laz. Laz, how are you? I am well, Tony. Thanks. Everything okay? Yeah. Everything's great. I got your message. What was so urgent? -I'm sorry about that. -Lucy and I just had an argument. It's okay. What about the company? What's wrong with the company? Nothing's wrong. Laz, it was just a misunderstanding. We're fine. Good to hear. Laz, what... How's Katherine? My poor daughter, Kat. She's been a mess for some time now. My first wife raised her in England of all places. She doesn't talk to anyone in the family. They called me when she tried... Tried... You never met her after all these years? I think... we should continue this in the living room. I guess I could stay a bit, now that I'm here. You know what? Let's just stay here. No, actually, you know, the living room is much more comfortable. Yeah, we can listen to that... Stravinsky you used to talk about. I just prefer to stay here. I lied to you before. About? "He thought she must be bouncing between the most beautiful dreams, as her eyes fluttered, threatening to wake. We were stripped bare in every sense imaginable. Very rarely did I smile after those days but, who could help it? We had made such beautiful poetry together." That's mine. I loved your book. It didn't drone on. It had a beginning, middle and end. I told you I read everything. What do you want from me? Everything. I can't help you. Look, Kat, this-this fantasy that you want to live in... There's no future in it. Don't do that. There's no future in it. Stop it. There's no future in it. Stop! -There's no future in it! -Stop it! There's no future, Kat. Stop it. No! Nathan! No. Nathan's your son. And Lucy doesn't know? It's his birthday tomorrow. And no one helped you. Anthony and I... I had a problem. They took him from me. They said I wasn't fit. To be his mother? To be his anything. I signed the paper. I signed it with this hand. They'll be back soon. -We can tell them. -Tell them what exactly? Kat, I... I know you now. Now I don't want to know you. Hey. I'm going downtown. How are you two? I know Nathan's back tomorrow. How was it having him away at camp for the first time? You really want to know? Really? Lucy. I don't care anymore. This isn't my business. Anthony and I have both been having affairs. That's why we're in here, because our lovers, well, they're in the living room. Right now. I should be going. No, no, no. You asked... Really. It's late. I gotta... I should be getting back. No, Laz. She's telling the truth. You ever stop to think about the millions of little things in people's lives... that pull them apart? See, in life, we bleed for people. I mean, that's what love is... blood. So we bleed until there's nothing left. Lucy, she's... You've taken all the blood I have for you. I'm dried up. Nothing. This isn't you, Kat. This is bullshit. You and me, we're not. Didn't you feel it? No, you fucked me. He fucked me too. Is this shit all you care about? Your-Your allowance and your-your penthouse? And-And your fucking Jimmy Choos? Is that what you want to hear? At least it'd be honest. I want my son, Ben. I want to watch him sleep! I want to smell him in the morning! I want... I want to wipe his tears. I need him. Look at me. I can help. Why do you want to help me? You know who I am. There's no one out there for people like us. Who's this? Laz, let me explain. Laz, what are you doing? Shut up, Lucy. Come with me. Take my hand. Katherine. Don't call me that. You can't tell me what to do. You only care now because you're here and you see me. -Come on. -Just... You're a fucking sperm donor. You're not my father. Just leave me alone. Kat. I thought your book was sad. Everyone said that. "There's no life without you." You stole that from someone. I can't remember who. You know, I never understood why he stayed and she didn't. He had a son. He lost his love. He was pointless. Give me that gun. And then we'll... Me and you will go right now, okay? Let's get out of here. I... I'll take care of us. What's your fantasy? I could love you. You already did. No, no! There was a book I had as a kid about the monarch butterfly. How it became itself. The caterpillar forms a chrysalis, then dissolves into nothing. It dies. Inside isn't a prison. It's an ocean of freedom... that stretches beyond the stars in the sky. It shows us the future. Then when it's ready, it rises from nothing, spreads its wings and flies away. Now I can walk the Great Wall of China. And go to Spain and run with the bulls. I could start something new. And wake up with the sun. I could love. And love and love.
