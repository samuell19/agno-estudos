[lights clicking] [dog barking] [crickets hissing] [distant train horn blaring] [Sudie] In Linlow, we never did think much about them signs. [dog barking] They was just there, like the rocks and the trees and everything else. Besides, with the war and all, only thing anybody ever talked about was the Germans and the Japs. But that was before Simpson. [owl hooting] [Mary] Lord, Sudie seen Lem Coker kissing Elsie McDonald on the bridge. And you know they're married, but not to each other. So, I guess you'd better do something about it. Sudie? For Pete's sake, Mary Agnes, I wish you wouldn't be telling God all that stuff I tell you. What are you doing here? It's time, come on. The moon is plumb-full. Now, get dressed. Sudie, I changed my mind, I ain't going. But we made a pact. And a pact is a pact. Friends don't back down on pacts. Now, are you my friend or not? Yeah, but I ain't going. I made up my mind, Sudie Harrigan, and you can't change it. Sudie? Sudie don't you dare! See? There ain't no niggers in that shack. It's nearly fell in! Besides, niggers is nine or ten foot tall. They couldn't even stand up in there. Yeah, but you know a bunch lived there one time before your Granddaddy run 'em off. Maybe they wasn't as big in them days. Come on, Sudie, let's go. There ain't no niggers in that shack. -I bet you a nickel. -You ain't got a nickel. Well, I bet, in case I ever get it. -[branch cracks] -[horse neighs] Oh, my Gosh! Come on, Mary Agnes. No, Billy, go play out in the street! Go get your own friends! Stop bothering me! Get outta here! Billy Harrigan, get your butt in here! [dog barking] -Did you take that money? -No. [Mr. Harrigan] You take more money, you won't sit for a week. [Billy] Stop it! I didn't take it! Sudie did it! Liar! [Mr. Harrigan] Your Mama seen you! Now, quit your lying! [Hester] Just stop it! You'd think he took a whole dollar. He didn't take but a dime. Make up your damn mind, Hester. [birds chirping] [dog barks] Maybe he wouldn't be so bad if he had a Daddy at home. You ain't been here in three weeks! Preacher Miller said any young 'un is doomed if he ain't got a Daddy to guide him. I wish you'd quit quoting the Bible according to Miller. His kids ain't no bargain, especially that one of his that got knocked up! Maybe you want me to quit working and let that job you got to support us, huh? Why can't you understand my working Saturdays pays for that room I sleep in? You got another woman, ain't you? I tell you, I can't take much more of this. You know, it used to be that we could talk. -[crickets chirping] -[dog barks] [door shuts with a thud] [birds chirping] [Sudie] Daddy! Daddy! What is it? Come to tell you "bye." Bye, Sudie. [birds chirping] Nice, over where you staying? It's all right. Just a room. It's got a radio, though. But don't tell your Mama, she'll think I got it better than her. I won't tell. You like her anymore? -She's your Mama. -Yeah, but do you like her? Did you do the dishes this morning? Yeah, I done 'em. Well, I'll see you in a few weeks. [engine idling] Sorry about your fight. You help your Mama now, you hear? I hear you. Thanks, Ray. Thanks an awful lot. Bye, Sudie. [Mary] Sudie. Sudie! The beauty parlor's open, come on! [Billy] Your Mama's gonna be electrocuted, -Mary Agnes. -[Mary] Hush up, Billy. [girl 1] That thing's scary. Do you reckon it hurts? [Billy] I hear, when you get electrocuted, your whole body flies up in the air. [indistinct chatter] [girl 1] Look, here comes Mrs. Moore. [girl 2] And she's got him with her. [woman 1] ...four or five, now. [woman 2] Yeah, but you know, I'd've said that they usually die by the time they're three years old. [Billy] I don't know why anybody would go through all that mess. [Billy] What's your Mama doing it for? [Mary] Mama says it's every woman's duty -to be as pretty as she can. -[girl 1] But why? [Mary] I guess because she knew. [Sudie] But them women is old. What's your Mama doing it for? She's married. [Mary] I don't know. Maybe it's so they'll keep being beautiful. [Sudie] Nobody ain't never putting that thing on my head, even if I never get married. Who's that pretty woman? That's the new Yankee school teacher. She came down here from up North. Ain't you ever seen her before? -Never. -Huh. I seen her the first day she come, Mr. Rice. -Oh. -Her name's Miss Marge. She's married to a real Marine from Middleton. Daddy said the Yankee won't last long in this town. -Hey, Doc. -[indistinct chatter continues] Charlotte Clark's fixing to get her brain fried. I think I'll bring Annabelle down here, she could use a little brain adjustment, too. Well, this is quite an attraction. I'm paying Alice Thompson to send me all the burn victims. [laughs] I wouldn't mind at all if Alice just sent me that Yankee school teacher. I sure would like to heat her up. [man] I'd like to warm her bunk myself. [men laughing] You two get together between teaching classes, Earl? Lem, Mrs. Allen's a married woman. [Billy] Look, Miss Thompson's fixing to turn on the electricity. -[people gasping] -[woman 1] Oh, God! Stand back. -[man] Look out. -[woman 2] It'll explode! [woman 1] I'm excited to see this! [people laughing] [crow cawing] [crickets hissing] [twig snaps] You don't have to be scared. I ain't gonna hurt you. Just gotta do me a little doctoring. That's all. [hushing] I know how scared you must be, but I ain't gonna hurt you. Watch while I leave... and you can turn around and go. [Sudie] Mister? Yeah. You a nigger? Name of Simpson. You got a name? You got a name? Sudie. You live around here? Uh-huh. Well, Miss Sudie, I'd better take care of this rabbit. It's still bleeding, you know. [crow cawing] How are you gonna doctor it? Got doctoring stuff? Well, I'm gonna put some soot on it, then I'm gonna bandage it real tight. Sounds like you know what to do. You ever see a colored man before? Not in person. That's what I thought. Thought I was gonna do you some bad harm? Yes, sir. Thought you was gonna kill me or eat me alive. You scared now? [birds chirping] [Sudie] Mister? What? You like kids? Yeah, I like kids. Now, go on home before your Mama starts worrying about you. [dog barking] [branch snapping] Hey! Ain't no use of you hiding. I see you there. Come on out! Damn! Why'd you follow me here? I live here! I worked my butt off to fix up this place, and now I got to leave because of you. Here! Here, you take care of this rabbit while I get my things together. And don't you even think about running off till I'm gone! [Sudie] But why? Why are you leaving? [Simpson] Why? Why, after you spread the word, every man in Linlow will be here with a shotgun. But I'm not gonna tell nobody, -I promise you. -If I let you go now, how soon do you think it'll be before I'll be hanging from one of these trees somewhere? You don't know everything. How come you think I'd tell? How come? It's because you white, that's why! Well, I ain't gonna tell, honest! I believed you when you said you wouldn't hurt me. Now, how come you don't believe me? Growed folks don't never believe kids. [dog barking] It's nice, the way you've fixed this place. Listen, there are signs at every end of this town that says what they think about colored folks. Now, what makes me think you any different? If I was you, I would tell. Well, that's stupid. If you was me, then you'd be me. And I'd never tell. I cross my heart and hope to die if I lie. [birds chirping] Now, are you just gonna stand there and let this rabbit bleed to death? Gimme that rabbit. Sometimes, I take care of hurting animals. I've got some magic salve I could bring, if you're fixing to stay. No, that's all right, some soot'll work just fine. Besides, if you like taking care of animals, you can... carry this rabbit home with you. Does that mean you ain't staying? We ain't talking about that no more. [Simpson exhales] Here you go. Oh, it ain't gonna come off! -It ain't? -No. Try. [birds chirping] -Surprise. -[laughs] You're a mighty lucky rabbit, rabbit! Sure is. We could call him Lucky. Right. This pig got a name? No. No. Not that I can remember. Well, how you doing there, little Baby Grunts? Come here. [Simpson] "Baby Grunts." [chuckles] You sure got a way with names. Thank you. And Lucky, too. Baby Grunts and Lucky, too. [dog barking] [door closes] -Where's Billy? -Don't know, Mama. Where in the Bible does they talk about niggers? They ain't in Bible, as I know. Did you do your homework? Yeah, I done it. I told you to fry some taters. We ain't got none. How come they ain't in the Bible? Preacher Miller was just talking-- [Hester] We ain't got no onions, neither? Uh-uh. I wonder why he did that? He was just-- Billy Harrigan, get in here. Hi, Mama. [Sudie] Simpson! Hey, Simpson! See, I didn't tell nobody. I brought salve so we could fix Lucky some more. Oh, that's nice. And guess what? Lucky got better, so I turned him loose. You shouldn't be out here. Why? Ain't nobody ever comes to this old home place. Nobody's lived here since before I was born. When was the last time? You mad at me for coming? No. I ain't mad. [birds chirping] Where have you been today? Well, been down in Cantor, working for Mr. Crowder. Cleaned out his barn for him, chopped up some wood. Did what needs doing. [Simpson exhales] You hungry? You have lunch today? Mama didn't have time to fix me nothing, -so I just took a apple. -Oh. I got me some hoecakes and some sorghum. They be ready soon. -Okay. -Good. Is he nice, that Mr. Crowder? He's been fair to me. I'm glad of that. They have them signs in Cantor? [Simpson] No, not as many. Ah-ah-ah! You spelling it wrong. -What? -[erasing chalk] That's the way they spell it, and they spell it wrong. -Well how do you? -N... E, G, R, O. "Negro." Say it. -Ne... -Ne... -...gro. -...gro. Negro. Yeah! Good. -I heard that word before. -Uh-huh. It's funny how they never taught that to us. I like my hoecakes a little scorched around the edge. -How about you? -Okay. Good. Let's go. [Sudie and Mary] Seven forty-one. Seven forty-two. Seven forty-three. Seven forty-four. Seven forty-five. Seven forty-six. Seven forty-seven. Seven forty-eight. [Mary] Oh, look! There's Mrs. Moore and Tommy. Mama says Tommy's Daddy joined the army 'cause he was ashamed. [girl] Yeah, he always made Tommy stay inside so no one could see him. -Let's follow 'em! -Okay. [boy] Hey, Sudie! Wonder why he's so odd-looking? Maybe it's a curse. -[blows raspberry] -Oh, horse dookey, Mary Agnes! Just 'cause somebody's odd-looking, don't mean they's cursed! Wait up! [birds chirping] [dog barking] [Simpson laughing] You like it? Oh, I guess it's okay for you to come here, now that I'm welcome in Linlow, Georgia. Or in the whole rest of the United States of America, as far as I'm concerned. Well, what if you get caught sign-stealing, Miss Sudie? Oh, I won't get caught. You like it? Yeah. I do. This is the best welcome I ever had. Oh, come on in here. Come on. Come on. [laughs] [Mary] I ain't bringing my paper dolls down here no more unless I get to be Scarlet. You get to be Scarlet all the time. [Sudie] But you do Melanie lots better than me. [Mary] I ain't being that whiny Melanie no more. Mary Agnes? You ever touched a growed man? What do you mean, have I ever touched a growed man? -What kinda question is that? -Just answer it. Of course, silly. Everybody touches their Daddy. I don't mean just when you bump into each other, when he switches you. I don't either. Of course I touch him. Like nice touching? Like, does he hold your hand, and... pat you on the back? Sure, all daddies does that. Why are you asking? Just because I wanted to know, is why. Well, you don't have to get ugly about it. So, can I be Scarlet or not? Yeah, you can be Scarlet. -[birds chirping] -[dog barking] [Miller] So, we must preach the Gospel to all people, everywhere. We are at war not only with the Germans and the Japs. We are at war with the devil himself! So, you can see why the message must be taken to the four corners of the Earth. If Columbus couldn't find no corners. I reckon we couldn't, neither. [Mrs. Clark] Mary Agnes! [Miller] We must go into Egypt and into all of Africa. We must save every man, woman, and child. -[boys whispering] -Red, yellow, white, or black. Or they will roast in the flames of eternal hell, doomed forever without Christ. [coughing] Now, hell is overflowing with the unsaved. Now is the time to get right with God, not tomorrow, the next day, or the next week, but now, while you are sitting in this solemn worship, for tonight, you may die in your sleep, or you may be struck dead by the devil while you are standing on the steps of this church today! Praise God. [congregation] Amen. [church bell chimes] -[Miller] How are you, sheriff? -[Sherriff] Good sermon. [Miller] Nice to see you. Hey, sweetheart. How are you? Thanks for coming. How are you doing? God bless you, son. How are you, my darling? Good to see you, Preacher Miller. Good job. I wanted to show you some figures-- Now, we're gonna talk about that in the Deacon's meeting, Earl. Clifford, listen, I want you to reconsider about asking these people for money. It's not as if we need a brick church. I want to tell you right now, the Board has met, and we will brick this church, the Lord willing, before winter. Jack, I reckon you're looking forward to school being out. Oh, I always say there's three things I like about my job. That's June, July, and August. [men laughing] [Sudie] Preacher Miller, does Negroes go to hell even if they's nice? How are you, Lem? Sudie, people who have been saved do not go to hell. Yeah, but it's hell saving a nigger, ain't it, Preacher? [Lem grunts] Damn kid. Why she's asking about niggers? -She never even seen one. -Strange kid, that Sudie. I'm always telling Charlotte to keep Mary Agnes away from her. Wouldn't be a bad idea, Lester. "Niggers going to heaven"... Why, if one just sets foot in this town, then we can go the other way, and damn fast. [Lester] You wouldn't be alone, Lem. -[indistinct chatter] -[church bell chimes] -[water rushing] -[crickets hissing] Simpson, how come you're doing all that? Almanac says there's gonna be a dry spell. On a nice day like today, how come you're out here, like I asked you not to be? How come you're not playing with your friends? You got friends, don't you? I got Mary Agnes. She's the only one that lives real close, except for Nettie. Who's Nettie? Well, she's rich, Her mama don't really let her play with... Well, Nettie's a real bore. [sighs] [sighs] [sighs] All right. Tell me about your family. [grunts] What's your Daddy do? He in the army? -Daddy? -Yeah No. He has a heart problem. So he works at a shoe factory in Buford. He makes shoes for the soldiers. He comes home about every... Well, a lot. He comes home a lot. Mary Agnes' Daddy ain't in the army, neither. -He's got flat feet. -Mm-hmm. -Simpson? -Yeah? -How come you ain't in the army? -Nobody ever asked me. I bet if I laid out in the sun every day, I'd turn into a negro. How long do you think that'll take? About a week. Got a wife? She died. Where'd you live when she died? Alabama. I was from Texas. She was from Alabama and wanted to live in Alabama. She was a teacher. Helped me to get my high school diploma. The night she was getting ready to have our baby... I put her in the car, took her to the hospital. They wouldn't accept no colored folks. So... we had a baby in the back of the car... [birds chirping] ...and she died birthing our baby. Three days later... the little girl died, too. You had a baby? Yep. Life can be hard sometimes. Do you have any idea what will happen if they catch a little white girl with a colored man? Wouldn't nobody hurt you. I wouldn't let 'em. And ain't nothing gonna happen to me, except I could get a whipping. Whipping ain't nothing. I get those all the time. Miss Sudie, you can't come back here no more. You ain't my Daddy, and you ain't my boss. I'll make up my own mind about coming here. No, you can't! Well, I'm coming back! And if you don't want me to, then you'll have to whip me! So either way, I'm getting a whipping! I'm never gonna whip you, Miss Sudie. But you're stubborn as a mule! [Mary] Every time you see Mr. Rice, you run. Now, is that the truth or not? You drive me plumb-crazy, Sudie! How come you don't never answer me? [Sudie] You sure you've been saved? [Mary] See there? There you go again. [Sudie] Just answer me, and I'll answer you. [Mary] Sure, I've been saved. -[Sudie] What does it feel like? -[Mary] Shoot, I don't know. You got saved. What's your saving feel like? [Sudie] I ain't never got saved. Well, you did, too. I've seen you get baptized the same day as Emily Smith. So, how come you think you ain't saved? -I can't tell you that part. -Why not? 'Cause it's a bad sin. Well, I won't tell, honest! Cross my heart and hope to die! Well, I ain't saved, 'cause... -Well, just 'cause. -'Cause what? 'Cause I used my thing to get nickels. Your what? My thing! -What thing? -My thing! Like your thing, stupid. My thing between my legs. You mean, that thing? -Yeah. -Lord, have mercy. How'd you get nickels with that thing? Oh, Rice gived 'em to me. [Mary] Mr. Rice? [dog barking] You mean... You mean, he gives you a nickel to see your thing? He don't see my thing. I see his thing. And then he gives me a nickel to wiggle it. A nickel? Just to wiggle his thing? Is it hard to wiggle? Oh, good grief, Mary Agnes, I don't wanna talk about it no more. Doggone it, Sudie, you always start something and won't finish it. Here, I ain't never even seen a growed-up thing, and you won't even tell me what it looks like. What kinda friend are you? A growed-up thing, Mary Agnes, is just like a little thing. Except it's bigger. And uglier. And bluer. Bluer? You mean, growed up things is blue? No, they ain't blue all over. They just got blue rows. Blue rows? Blue rows of what? Just blue rows of rows. That's all. And sometimes they get sick. What do they get sick from? I reckon it's dropsy. Gosh, Mr. Higgins' Daddy died of dropsy. Yeah, well, Earl Rice ain't never die of it, 'cause he gets it all the time. Anyway, wiggling things is a big sin, and it's all my fault. How come? 'Cause Eve gived Adam that apple! Don't you listen to nothing the Preacher says? Sure, I listen to the preacher. Well, the big sin is my thing, not his. We got these awful things that makes man get some kind of madness. It's like they was crazy. Mama says they can't help it, and we gotta face up to it, just 'cause of the kinda things that we got. Mary Agnes, we got wicked things. Well, your thing maybe wicked, but mine ain't. Anyhow, I don't wiggle Earl Rice's thing no more. He's got Betty McMillan's little sister doing it for him now. He brags on all the other girls that wiggle it for him. Clara Mae? But she's just a kid. -She probably ain't ten. -She ain't. She's nine. Shoot. Her hands are itty-bitty. When it comes to wiggling a big ol' thing, I bet you done it a lot better than her. -Oh, Mary Agnes, horse dookey! -[Mary] Sudie! My husband will be home on leave starting next Thursday, Mr. Etheridge. I haven't seen him in seven months. I'd appreciate two days off. Sure, I'll just call a substitute and we'll see you on Monday. Thank you. Oh, Miss Allen? Don't let him wear you out, you hear? -Excuse me. -You Miss Marge? Yes. -I've been waiting for you. -You want something? I just ain't never seen a real Yankee before so I wanted to see what one would look like up close, so... -Well, do we look any different? -Uh-uh. -What's your name? -Sudie. Sudie Harrigan. -[school bell ringing] -Can I talk to you for a minute? [Sudie] And I hadn't seen him in a long time, and we got to talking about everybody in the family and all. So, my cousin, she knows this girl, who knows this girl, who has a negro friend. I reckon up north, lots of folks have colored friends. I suppose so. You ever had a negro friend that was a growed man? I can't say that I have. I heard that up north, it's different. -I heard this. People up there-- -Sudie. Why are you asking me all these questions? No reason. No reason at all. I just like to learn stuff. I see. So, do Yankees look like you thought they would? No, ma'am. Yankees is purdy! [laughs] [Simpson] Here. Close your eyes. -[Sudie] Close? -[Simpson] Close your eyes. Come on. Got you. [birds chirping] Where are we going? I can't see! Will you just keep your eyes closed? I'll lead you straight. What is it, Simpson? Please tell me. You just keep your eyes shut. Jut slide around in there. Ah. Stand, right there. [water rushing] Now, open your eyes. -[gasps] -[Simpson chuckles] [Sudie] Oh, my gosh! How'd you do it? -It's all yours. -Look at that! -Oh, Simpson! -[Simpson chuckles] You see this way? You got a place for yourself. Some animals, when you find 'em. -You made this all for me? -Yeah. -[sighs] -I can't believe it! Yeah, I built this, Miss Sudie, so you could have a place that you can call your own. Something that belongs to you. But I don't mind sharing at all! Oh, I know you don't mind sharing, Miss Sudie. You know, you have the most generous spirit of anybody that I've ever met. But now, see, this place here? It's so you don't have to go all the way to my place no more. What's that supposed to mean? Just what I said. Where you going? You mean, you built this place 'cause you don't ever wanna see me no more? Oh, no, Miss... Miss Sudie, I want to see you every day. But it's like I said, it's dangerous. It's mean, Simpson! It's the meanest present I ever got. Well, I didn't mean it to be mean. Miss Sudie, I built this place so can you could have something for yourself. -I'll come visit you. -No, you won't. Yes, I will. Hey. We'll do our spelling lessons right here, on this rock. -But I can't come to see you? -That's right, Miss Sudie. That's the way it has to be. I hate it, but it has to be that way. That's the way it is. These are for you. [dog barking] Thank you, Simpson. It's the nicest thing anybody ever made for me. You're welcome Gosh! I just can't believe this! -How'd you do it? -Oh, I just done it. You didn't build this place, Sudie Harrigan. You just lying. You can't build stuff, so who builded it? Well, to tell you the truth, my daddy builded it. Your daddy done it? When? Last time he was home. Gosh, I just can't believe he done it. [birds chirping] [Mary] This is the best place I ever seen! What do you call it? -My secret place. -[Mary] Oh. -Did you hurt yourself? -[Mary] Uh-uh. Why? Looks like you cut your butt or something. Oh, my gosh! I guess I did cut myself. -Well, Does it hurt? -Uh-uh. I just can't see what's cut. Maybe you cut your thing? Oh, no! Well, no, let's just say that it ain't cut. 'Cause if it doesn't hurt, then it can't be cut. But if you do find out that it's cut, just put this salve on it, and it'll get better. Use a lot. Ugh. How are you doing today? Your thing get well? [Mary] Yeah. You must've hurt it bad! I didn't hurt it none. Mama said I've turned into a woman. Well, what she say that for? 'Cause I started menstruation. -What's that? -Bleeding. Women does it once a month. Can you believe it? Once a month, for four or five days, for the rest of your life. I could just puke. Once a month for the rest of your life? -I ain't doing it. -All women does it. It's another one of them curses, on account of Eve giving Adam that apple. I hate Eve's guts. [birds chirping] [Earl] Preacher! Preacher Miller, I'm sorry about being late -with the money box. -[Miller] Mm-hmm. Looks like we're making some money though, huh? The kids're making the money, Earl. Oh, yeah, right. Don't nobody get rich cleaning bricks. I've been here half the morning, and I ain't made but eighteen cents. You can do it if you want to, but I'm going home. Well, I'm gonna stay and make some more money. -I'll see you later. -Bye. Bye. There's your 85 cents, Sudie. That's a lot of brick. Sure is. It's hard work, too. Well, that's the best thing for the soul, Sudie. Best thing for the soul. Well, good night. Your soul must be starved. [car engine revving] [birds chirping] [Sudie] Preacher Mill-- -Hi, Sudie. -I ain't doing it no more. -I ain't! -You look pretty today, Sudie. You made me drop my money! -I'll give you some more money. -No! -Come on. -I ain't doing it no more! I ain't doing it no more! I ain't gonna touch it! I ain't gonna touch it! I ain't! Get away! Get away! No! Come on! I don't wanna do it no more! Don't make me! I ain't gonna do it! I don't want to do it no more. I don't want to. [birds chirping] Simpson! Sudie, what happened? -Oh, Simpson. -Sudie. Tell me what's happened? All right, what's going on? Tell what happened, huh? He stole my money. Stole my money. -Your money? -My money. Shh, okay, you don't have to say nothing. You don't have to say another word. Shh. -[Sudie sobbing] -Okay. Okay. Mm. It's all right. It's gonna be okay. It's okay. All right. Shh. It's gonna be all right. It's gonna be all right. Oh, it's okay. It's gonna be okay. [door creaking] You come in this house, this late again, I'm gonna blister you. Where you been? How come you're all wet? Look at me! How come your face is so scratched? Down in the creek, Mama. Well, what was you doing in the creek? I swear to God, you're gonna get eat up by boogers if you don't fall in the creek and drown first. Go on, change your clothes. I'll fry you some taters. [birds chirping] [dog barking] [Simpson] Hey, Miss Sudie. Listen to God's music. [Sudie] Uh-huh. That's just about the best day of the year. Don't you agree? Uh-huh. [birds chirping] [Simpson] It sure is a good thing I did this irrigation ditch. You wouldn't have no vegetables no more. [Sudie] We ain't got none at home. -Mom's garden dried up. -Oh, yeah? Yeah. Everybody else's did, too. I never knowed I was the color of creek sand. Simpson, I figured it out. Figured what out? I'm the color of creek sand. And you, you's the color of garden dirt! And the Indians... they's the color of red clay! Doesn't that just make you wanna sing out? Everybody's made out of dust! And God didn't make you black to punish you for nothing. He didn't make nobody no color to punish them for nothing. He made everybody the color they is on account of that just happened to be the color He was standing on. [clears throat] Well, you... You sure figured that out, didn't you? [chuckles] [laughs] If that ain't it, I sure don't know what He had in mind! [both laughing] Wouldn't it be funny if Mama got God answering her prayers, and he turned out to be a negro? [both laughing] Hey, Miss Sudie. I still got some of that salve that you left. Wanna put some of that on your face? No. It's okay. [Mary] Mama said Doctor Stubs isn't in the army, 'cause he is the sole surviving son. His little brother's airplane got shot down by Japs. They're all gone. [Mary] See, I told you everybody picked most of Mr. Henderson's berries. How come you don't pay attention to me? Remember that time I told you Miss Henderson dyed her hair? I was right. Mama said Lois Henderson dyed her hair every month. That just proves you should pay attention. [pig squeals] -Oh, my God. -Sudie, where are you going? [Sudie] I wanna catch that pig! [pig squeals] Come on, Baby Grunts, come on! Get going. Come on, come on, Baby Grunts, keep moving! -Come on! -[pig squeals] Oh, God, is that a real nigger? God, Sudie's gone plumb-crazy. Well, if she thinks I'm talking to a crazy girl, she's got another thing coming! Mary Agnes Clark, are you gonna leave them berries -after we got all scratched up? -[Mary] Did you catch that pig? Uh-uh. He run too fast. Sudie Harrigan, if you don't tell me the fair truth, I'm gonna tell everyone in Linlow you handed over a pig to a blacked-up nigger! -Mary Agnes, I'm gonna get you. -No, you're not! [both grunting] [man] Hey, hey, hey! What's going on here? She was giving a pig to a real-life nigger! He wasn't neither no nigger! He was just a stranger, and his pig jumped off of his truck onto the road, that's all! It was, too, a nigger. I seen him plain as day with my very own eyes. Where was he, Mary Agnes? Up there, by them trees. That's a pretty fair pace. You just thought you seen him. You know we don't allow no niggers around here! Now, why don't the two of you just go on up to the house and wash up and rest a while? I don't wanna ever speak to you again, as long as I live. No! No! [Nettie] How come you are not waiting for Sudie? -'Cause she's a liar. -How come? It's not worth talking about. Besides, Nettie, you're much more fun. [Clara Mae] No, no! [sobbing] Fifty cents will... buy you girls a... [coins clinking] ...whole lot of candy. [bell chiming] [Mary] Nettie! Nettie, wait! [Mary] That's all there is to it. Their things get to tickling. It's like itching. And so, they need to wiggle it, or get somebody to wiggle it for him. And whoever wiggles it gets a nickel. It's a lot of money for not hardly doing nothing. I'd be scared to wiggle it, even for a nickel Would you be scared, too, for a dime? Would you? Maybe. You think Clara Mae will tell her Mama? Not ever. Would you tell? No! I'd get a whipping for sure. Would you ever tell Clara Mae's mother about her? Are you crazy? Then we'd both get whipped. Nah. I reckon it's one more of them Eve things. What's an Eve thing? Something serious and secret. Maybe that's what's wrong with Sudie. No. Eve never counted on anybody being as strange as Sudie. Simpson! Simpson! Hey, Baby Grunt! I haven't seen you for a while. Gosh, you stink. Where's Simpson? Huh? Simpson! Where are you? I got something for you! Simpson? [door opens] -Simpson? -[door closes] Where are you? Simpson! What's wrong? Uh... I think I got a touch of the influenza. Well, how long have you been sick? Two, three days, maybe. You hungry? I could fix you something. Uh... I'm not hungry... Don't worry about me. -[Simpson clears throat] -I brought you a present. Have you? It didn't cost nothing. Unwrap it. If you don't like it, I could fix it or something. I could change it. Oh, no! I like it. You did this with your own hands? That makes it that much more special. Thank you, Miss Sudie. You're welcome, Simpson. Now, you lay real still. I'm gonna make you some tater soup, and... You got any doctorin' stuff? It's out there somewhere. Simpson? I brought you your soup. [Simpson] Mm-hmm. You're hot! Simpson... please don't die. [children shouting] [Sudie] Miss Marge, I need you to help me. My friend, he's sick, and he ain't got no friends, and he ain't got no folks. Please come. Sudie, I can't just leave school. But he might die! Nobody knows your friend? I find that odd, Sudie. I don't understand why. 'Cause he's a negro. Oh, my God. Sudie, this-- I'm-- I don't know what to do about this. Well, just help him. Just come with me and help him. Sudie, I can't leave school. Besides, you need a doctor. Call Dr. Stubbs. I reckon everybody hates negros. [Marge] That's not true. Well, then how come you won't come with me to help him? Because I could lose my job. [bell rings] Sudie? Stay here. I'll call a substitute. [sighs] [door opens with a creak] Simpson, you's better! Miss Marge, he's better! Come on! You don't have to be scared! This here's a teacher, Miss Marge, and she's a Yankee. And she's nice, and she likes negros. Well, I'm mighty pleased to meet you, ma'am. Mighty pleased. How do you feel, Mr. Simpson? Uh? Oh, well, I'm... Fair to middlin'. -I've been sick, see? -Why are you talking so funny? That fever get to your mind? Please, Mr. Simpson, Sudie's told me all about you. You can trust me. I appreciate that, ma'am. Thanks for coming. You come down here by yourself? Mm-hmm. Linlow needed an English teacher, and I needed a change. My husband is in the Marines. -Overseas? -Mm-hmm. He just went back. -Have you known Sudie very long? -Not too long. She is a fine young 'un. -You know her family? -[Marge] No, no. I don't. Don't even see them in church with her. Oh, you're a church-goer, Miss Marge. Yes. Uh-- Fairly regularly. How do you like our preacher? Reverend Miller? [Marge laughs] I give him an "A" for allocution. [laughs] [both laughing] You all hungry? Ah! I hope you are getting used to southern cooking, Miss Marge. I am getting used to a lot of interesting southern phenomenon, Mr. Simpson. [Sudie] What you want, Mary Agnes? I come to tell you something. What? I gotta get these clothes in before my mama comes home. Remember that time you told me about Mr. Rice? Well, Sudie, I've seen him with my very own eyes. Seen what? He was trying to do it with Clara Mae McMillian. Me and Nettie came up on 'em, and Clara Mae ran off. Mr. Rice, he gave us 50 cents. Me and Nettie ate candy. Oh, Sudie I feel so awful. I've been so mean, telling everybody about that nigger, but you don't have to worry. Nobody believes me, anyhow. It's all right, Mary Agnes. Don't worry about it. It-- It really-- It really was a nigger, wasn't it? A negro. Yes, it really was a negro How come you give him that pig? 'Cause it was his. How do you know it was his? I know that it was his, 'cause he's my friend. Your friend? Niggers ain't friends. Yeah, they is! [Mary] Well? Does he live in that nigger shack? I ain't telling you where he lives. -And don't call him a nigger. -Why not? 'Cause he is a negro. N-E-G-R-O. Negro? Sounds better, don't it? How come none of this stuff's in the Bible? I'unno. -Come help me fold these towels. -Sure. [Sudie] Get the door. You been sick? You look awful pale. No, I ain't been sick. I just got a cold. It ain't nothing. [man talking indistinctly] -[Sudie] Simpson? -[Simpson] Yeah? [Sudie] You ever make a dirt castle? [Simpson] No, not that I can remember. You wanna make one? It's easy. Miss Sudie, I'm trying to plant these taters. Well, I already started. You could just help me. Come on! -[man laughing] -[indistinct chatter] [chatter continues] [man] What's this? What you doing there? [chuckles] Well, nothing, sir. Just planting me some taters. That's all, sir. Where'd you come from, nigger? Well, I-- I stays with some friends over at Cantor, sir. Whose taters are you planting? [Simpson chuckles] Well, I have to confess, sir, that... Well, they mines. You see, I works for Mr. Crowder over in Cantor. And... He owns this here property, and he said it was okay for me to plant myself a nice little garden. Have you ever heard of Crowder in Cantor? Yeah, he's got land over in Braselton and Hog Mountain. He got any around these parts? Hell, I don't know. He probably does. -[gun cocking] -[hunter 1] Don't move! I'll blow a hole through your gut. [hunter 2] What the hell's this? Oh, that's-- I was just practicing, making them tater hills. [hunter 2] You ever raised taters before, nigger? [Simpson chuckles] No, sir. Hell, this nigger's too stupid to wake up in the morning! Let's leave him be. Dammit, boy, I said don't move! I'll empty your head of what little brain's you've got! Now, I'm gonna ask you something. How often do you come up here? Ha! Once a week, sir, on the freight train. Once a week. That's all, sir. [chuckles] Well, you keep it that way, you hear? Oh, yes, sir. Just once a week. Thank you, sir. [hunters laughing] [indistinct chatter] Miss Sudie? Yeah, Simpson? Don't you move. Stay right there until I tell you what to do. -You hear me? -I hear you. [Simpson] And I'm gonna walk toward the well. When I get to the path, I want you to run toward the house as fast as your legs could carry you. You got that straight? I got it. One more thing, Miss Sudie. I love you. I love you just like you was one of my own. I love you, too, Simpson. There's lots of bad folks, and I don't mean just killing folks, either. There's men that would do bad things to you if they knew you just came here. You think I don't know nothing about men. Well, I do. I know lots. There's a man in Linlow who's doing bad things already. He's been doing them for a long time. To you? Lots of other girls, too. Is that what happened the night you came here crying? It's my fault, 'cause I'm a girl. Miss Sudie... Miss Sudie, listen to me. You don't have to be ashamed of anything. What that man did to you was not your fault. It wasn't right. And that preacher ain't right. And your mama, if she listens to that preacher, ain't right. Miss Sudie... Let me tell you. I got the same Bible they got. I read it from front to back. That man committed a sin, not you, Sudie. Miss Sudie, everything on your body is good and right in the eyes of the Lord. It says so, right here on the front page of this Bible. Have you told anybody about this? Well, you got to tell somebody. That's the only way to stop that man! Nobody listens to a kid over a grown-up. Nobody cares. Well, I care, Sudie! The trouble is how much I care! You're the little girl I never did get to raise. Damn, I hate it, that man who hurt you! Sudie, you got to tell your teacher. You got to tell her! Sudie, wait a minute! Sudie! Sudie! [Simpson thinking] Dear Mrs. Allen. This afternoon, Miss. Sudie told me something that tore me up. I know it may not be my place to talk about this, but I can't keep it to myself. And maybe you can help. There's a man in Linlow... Miss Marge? [Marge] Mm? I know a teacher who's a low-down skunk. Why? 'Cause he makes little girls wiggle his rotten old thing. His thing? You mean his penis? Is that a Yankee thing? Actually, it's the same thing, North or South. How do you know about this teacher? 'Cause I wiggled it myself a hundred times. Do you believe me? Of course I believe you. Well then, can you do something about it? 'Cause he does it to lots of girls. I think he's still doing it to Clara Mae, 'cause Mary Agnes and Nettie seen them -behind the school yard. -Sudie... Will you tell Mr. Etheridge about this if I go with you? I ain't telling Mr. Etheridge nothing. [Marge] Sudie. Sudie, wait a minute! Sudie! You teachers is like peas in a pod. No, we're not. [sighs] [sighs] Do you trust anybody? Nah. You have to trust somebody. Only Simpson. What about your parents? Nah, they lie. Tell me about your parents. They fuss a lot. Well, you know, they work hard. Maybe they're tired. Daddy don't never go to church, and Mama, she just don't have time no more. She works in a pants mill. That ain't why they lie. Church folks lie, too. What do they lie about? Well, they tell that Negroes is boogers. That girls' things is an awful sin... only, kids ain't got no sins. All that stuff. Do Yankees go barefooted? Yes, Yankees go barefooted. And stop trying to change the subject. Sudie. Will you tell me the names of the girls that this teacher has molested? Maybe. But I thought I ain't never got saved, 'cause I thought what this man done was my fault. But Simpson says it ain't. And Simpson's right. He's a fine man. He wrote me a note this morning. He-- He told me, he was very upset about what you told him. That's why he wrote to me, so that I could do something about it. -I gotta go home, Miss Marge. -Sudie! Sudie, wait a mi... Don't run from this. It's all quite ridiculous, Mrs. Allen. Our teachers are the finest men I know. That child is telling the truth, Mr. Etheridge. Everybody knows that Sudie is prone to lie. Our teachers are good, God-fearing Christians. How many children will have to be molested before there's enough proof? That's enough, Mrs. Allen. I won't be put off like this, Mr. Etheridge. That's dangerous talk, Mrs. Allen. Now, I've got other things to do. [indistinct chatter] -[boy] Pitcher. -[all cheering] I've tried to talk to several other girls about what happened. They won't. I know it's very difficult. You two are my last hope. Please, please tell me if you've seen anything. It's very important for a lot others just like the two of you that someone have the courage to tell the truth. Please. I already know one girl who's been hurt by this man, Mary Agnes. You know her, too. We need somebody else to speak up, because Mr. Etheridge is not gonna believe just her. Mary Agnes, will you help us, please? I'm sorry, Miss Allen. I gotta be getting home. Come on, Nettie. [boy] You missed it. I just don't know where she could be, 'cause she's been acting so strange lately! -[Mr. McMillian hushing] -Well, we just have to assume that Clara Mae just simply wandered off in woods and got lost. Alrighty? We've already covered the town's close end and the woods nearby? We're gonna search the woods a little further up. Walter? Walter, you have the team set up for the search? Yeah, got everything covered, including the woods behind Mr. Henderson's. Lester, I want you to, uh... Your group, cover the mill area. [indistinct chatter] And I want-- Because Henderson's gonna be covering the creek all the way up to just past the old Branden place. All right. Mattie, now you just wait here. Alright? Some of you wanna stay with them. I guess-- I guess I'll go with the Doc. Now, whoever finds Clara Mae, I want you to come back here, and I want you ring the bell. I'm gonna be working in the woods behind my house. If I hear the bell, I'll come running. Sure. Mattie... We'll find her. Mr. Simpson! Mr. Simpson! It's Marge Allen! Mr. Simpson! [Sudie] Simpson! Simpson! -What are you doing here? -[Marge] Sudie, he's gone. No, come on and stop dallyin' or they'll shoot him. No he-- They won't shoot him. He's-- He's moved out. -They're gonna shoot him! -They won't shoot him. He's gone, Sudie. You're lying! You're just lying! I'm... not lying. Sorry, Sudie! He's gone! Baby Grunts is gone! Come on, Sudie, I'll take you back. Come on. [man] Come on, let's get this business over with. It's hotter than red hell out here. Henderson, where the hell are you? That irrigation ditch! Somebody's getting ready for another drought. What's going on here? That ain't no new ditch, that's been here a year or two. [girl] I guess somebody had vegetables last year. Our garden dried up. -[man] What the hell is this? -Well, everybody's did. [man] Who the hell has got a garden way down here? Hey, look over here! -[man 1] What? -[man 2] What's there? [indistinct chatter] [man] Good lord. [indistinct chatter] [man 1] Whoever lived here, ain't been gone long. [man 2] If this don't beat all! You wouldn't've thought anybody could live in this old place. -[bell chiming] -[woman] They've found her. [man 2] Come on, let's go. [indistinct chatter] Clara Mae, look at me, sweetheart. [sobbing] Why ain't she talking, Dr. Stubbs? What's the matter? I believe she is in shock. Mac, I want you to run out. Get my car and pull it around the front. -Just take her in my office. -[Mr. McMillian] Yes, sir. -Jack, grab my bag. -[Jack] You got it. [Walter] Come on, darling. Mattie, she's gonna be all right. Come on, Mattie. [man on speaker] All right, everybody, listen please. [Mr. Etheridge] I got a pretty good idea what happened to Clara Mae. Higgins found her about a mile from the old Branden home place. Henderson's group, here, discovered someone's been living there. Whoever it was moved out mighty fast. -[man 1] Yeah. -[man 2] Yeah, and he left a damn good garden with an irrigation ditch. Sudie goes down the tracks, past the bridge all the time. Maybe she knows who lived there. [Henderson] Yeah, the Branden land backs up to mine. Sudie and Mary Agnes was picking berries down by my creek last summer, and Mary Agnes comes to me with this story about seeing Sudie handing a pig to a nigger down close to Branden land. They got in a big fight over it. [Rice] We all know what that means. Some nigger done something to Clara Mae, and there ain't no telling what he done to Sudie. That son of a bitch has been pulling one over on the whole town! Now, men, y'all get ready and be back here in an hour. We're gonna find that boy and fix him good. [indistinct chatter] [Lester] Come on, Mary Agnes, we're going home. [indistinct chatter] Sudie. Simpson didn't do nothing. Earl Rice was the one who'd done it. Earl Rice? Sudie, we need more proof. I knew it wouldn't do no good to tell nobody. Oh, it will. Believe me. I cross my heart and hope to die, it will. But who will believe me? Dr. Stubbs. He'll listen. But first, I have to tell Mr. Etheridge about this. Why? He'll just blame me. [Marge] You wait right here, Sudie. It's worse than we thought. I mean, Sudie is covering up for that nigger, because he's got some kind of a hold on her. You know damn good and well Earl Rice had nothing to do with any of this! Sudie was already a big trouble. But now it's worse. -I mean, making up stories... -I believe her, Mr. Etheridge. Then you are being very foolish, Mrs. Allen. But that's your business. Mr. Etheridge... you and those men are making a terrible mistake. I'll be the judge of that, Mrs. Allen. [door closes] Mary Agnes Clark, you come here right now! Mary Agnes, get back in this kitchen! [exhales] I always told you that young'un wasn't nothing but trash! You knew all the time that nigger was living in that house, didn't you? You'd better answer me, Mary Agnes Clark! We're gonna be the disgrace of this town! Did you go to the nigger's house? Did you? [commentator on radio] So, with two whole counts on first base, Mr. Gary Roy. Right-hander, Felix Carter, will take them out... [car engine revving] [indistinct radio announcer] Hey, nigger lover! Your sister's a nigger lover. You too, Billy? [boy laughing] Forget how to talk, nigger lover? [woman] What's going on here? [boys laughing] -Can't believe it. -[boy laughing] I can't believe Sudie was caught with a nigger. [indistinct commentator on radio] [housekeeper] Come on in. [indistinct commentator on radio] Dr. Stubbs? [Walter] In here! -Hi. -[Marge] Hi. Thank you for seeing us, Doctor. Sure. -How about something to eat? -[Marge] Oh, sure. Sit down. -Here you go. -[Marge] Thank you. Simpson says it wasn't my fault. [Walter] Mr. Simpson's right, Sudie. Mr. Rice is a sick man. My God, it's hard to believe. And if Sudie feels guilty, I'm sure the other girls feel the same way. Please don't let nothing happen to Simpson! He would never hurt nobody. He couldn't. First time I saw him, he was saving a rabbit. I'll do my best, darling. -Where is he now? -I don't know. [inhales] Well... We'll need a town meeting. I'll get everybody there, even if I have to tell them I found the colored man. [inhales] Sudie... I'm gonna need your daddy there. I'm gonna have to call him. [indistinct chatter] [indistinct chatter continues] Alright, I know we are all tired, so we'll get on with this. [indistinct chatter] You're looking for the wrong man. [Lem] Whatever the hell you're up to, we want you to know the County Police knows the whole story. They're out looking for him right now. We ain't got time -for what you think you know. -That's right. I'm glad you got the police involved, Lem, -'cause we're gonna need 'em. -What did I tell you? Huh? [indistinct chatter] Alright, I had a long talk with Clay and Hester Harrigan last night. I wanna thank them publicly for coming here today. I know it took a great deal of courage. Now I know, most of you think that the... colored man staying at the old Branden place... was the man who did something to Sudie and Clara Mae. But you're wrong. -[man] You're wrong. -You're dead wrong! [Lester] You're wasting our time here, Doc. Now, Mary Agnes knows all about this. Speak up, Mary Agnes, tell them what Sudie told you. -Lester. -She's my daughter, -for Christ's sake! -Lester! [man] Just wait a minute. You heard what they had to say. Mary Agnes, it's alright. Go ahead. She-- She told me... I mean... Sudie told me that the colored man was a friend. [indistinct chatter] I ain't never telling her nothing ever again. [Walter] Alright, quiet down. What you doing this for? We don't need no proof, Doc. Why don't you shut your damn mouth for a minute, and I'll tell you? Get on with it, Doc. Sudie and Clara Mae... and several other girls in this town... have been sexually molested. Oh, my God, Doc. -You mean, there's more? -[indistinct chatter] Everybody be quiet and let Doc talk! I'll say something now, and I want every adult to hear it, and I want you to hear it good. Not one, not one... of these girls... ever told their parents. Or anybody else, for that matter. Now, you just let that sink in a minute. I'm ashamed, and you should be, too. Every last one of us... is guilty of letting these children be victims of lies that tell these girls that their body's a sin. [man] Their bodies are a sin! [Walter] It's no wonder they're afraid of us and don't trust anybody! Now, Sudie wouldn't name the other girls. And I respect her for that. I know some of you here. And I'm gonna have to ask you girls a big favor. I need just one of you... to tell me who it is. 'Cause if you don't... an innocent man... is probably gonna die. And a guilty man... is gonna go on, free as a breeze. That colored man didn't do it. [crowd murmuring] [indistinct arguing] [Sudie] Simpson! [man] What's happening? Where you going? What's going on? [indistinct chatter] -[girl] A colored man! -[woman 1] A colored man? -[woman 2] Come back here! -[girl] Mama! [man] What is he doing, coming in here? [indistinct chatter] [Walter] Hello, Dan, Thanks for coming. Simpson. [indistinct chatter] [Walter] Okay, okay, that's enough! Quiet! [man] Go ahead now. I'm Daniel Crowder. I'm a business man and a farmer, from over in Cantor. This man here... Mr. Simpson, has worked for me for over a year. Now, I'm here... because I do not believe he is guilty of anything, except maybe trespassing some of those damn signs y'all put up everywhere. Them signs were put there in the first place to keep this kind of thing from happening. Maybe y'all should just get on back to Cantor. If he was guilty... do you think he'd come back here and face a bunch like y'all? Looks to me like that nigger's messed up your mind, just like you messed up Sudie's. Oh, for God's sake, Lem, shut up. Now, the reason why I come here is to get this little girl here to speak her mind. So that that sick man's poison doesn't hurt any other little girls any more than it already has. Mr. Harrigan, did... Sudie tell you who molested her? No, she didn't. You mind? Sudie. You are the finest, most honest, smartest young lady I have ever met. And I hope my coming here will help you get your life back. [Lem] What the Sam Hill is going on here, Doc? Son, you need to shut your mouth or I'm gonna shut it for you. [indistinct arguing] Sudie. Now, Sudie, look at me. What you about to say is probably the hardest and bravest thing you'll ever have to do. But you gonna have to speak. Do it for yourself, for Clara Mae... and for all the others. You get to tell, Sudie. Let me tell your daddy who molested you. Miss Sudie? Sudie, you know how dangerous it is for me to come here! Now speak. Speak for me and for yourself, please. -Earl Rice done it. -[woman gasps] [Lem] Damn it, I've heard enough! Sudie Harrigan is a born liar, just like her father, and y'all know it. [Mary Agnes] No, she's not. Me and Nettie seen him with Clara Mae the day he give us 50 cents for candy. -[woman] Oh, my God. -[Indistinct chatter] You hare-brained bastard. Now, you wanna listen, but it ain't gonna happen today. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. [indistinct chatter] [sobs] [man] You're gonna burn in hell, Rice! Why don't you drive him off a bridge? I was wrong, Sudie, for leaving the way I did but... I had to get away. There was no way I could talk to you about it. You know, when... we was in the field... and I told you that I loved you? I meant it. I also know that I should've told you that a long time before that. But I knew... from the first time I saw you, that sooner or later... I'd have to leave this place. I was having so much fun, I didn't wanna think about it. You know, Sudie... I believe that the Lord put us together. But I also know... we can't stay together. I hope you can see that, now. We can't change the world. You've... got to be with your family. And me... Well... I wanna go to Houston. I got two brothers. Hey, uh... I got a present in there for you. You wanna go see it, hmm? Just out there. -[Sudie sniffs] -Yeah? Come on. Oh, Simpson! It's beautiful. Now, go on! Open it! Go on! [gasps] Wow. It's beautiful. Oh, Simpson! [birds chirping] [children shouting] [girl] Hurry! [indistinct shouting] [girl] Hey, look what we just done!
