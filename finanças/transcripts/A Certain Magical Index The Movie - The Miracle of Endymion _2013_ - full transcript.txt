The left engine block has fallen away. I-It's hopeless! Don't give up! There's still something we can do! Are we okay? Oh, god... The space plane Orion crash landed in the 23rd school district of academy city. The Orion came in contact with some debris in the stratosphere just before making re-entry, and ended up crash landing due to engine failure and other trouble. Luckily, all eighty-eight passengers aboard are confirmed to have survived. Repeat, all eighty-eight passengers aboard are confirmed to have survived. A certain magical index the movie...

Say, toma, has that always been there? Yes, it has! You really are lost when it comes to science, huh? It was there then... And then... And then, too! It's there, plain as day! Wow, I had no idea. They just recently announced it, but they say its speed would definitely be impossible outside of academy city. Hmm... I can tell that its speed is incredible. So tell me, toma... What? What is a "space elevator"? Well, you see, something that doesn't use a rocket or shuttle, but can lift stuff directly into space is a space elevator. Oh! The side of science is trying to make even the tower of babel a reality, huh? Here, index, you can see better from here.

Dah! Stay back! Thank you very much. "Gloria" "also available for download!" Thank you. I'm meigo arisa. Ee-yow-w-w... I-I'm sorry. Toma... Man, that really was amazing. It was touching! Right, toma? Huh? I don't listen to a lot of music, but even so, I could tell it was incredible. Mm-hmm! Mm-hmm! Look. I downloaded all of your songs onto here. Thank you. I'm so glad you like them. Mm-hmm. I'm kind of picky when it comes to music. But arisa, your stuff is the real deal. You're not even casting any spells over your music, and yet it can still charm everyone like it does. Mm-hmm. Spells? O-oh, you know... like a scene that is clearly portrayed... Yeah, for a moment, it seemed like telepathy or something. But apparently, not, huh? No, I don't think so. I'm a level 0. Oh, you don't say. Mm-hmm. I was troubled by it before, but now, I'm kind of grateful, I think. Hmm? Grateful? I mean, if I had an ability, I'm sure I would have turned to it. In fact, I don't think I would have ever sung in the first place. Oh? Is that right? Mm-hmm. I was never any good at my studies, either. The only thing I could do was sing songs. So I decided I would do whatever it took to sing! I hope that someday, I'll be able to sing in a large place, in front of a lot of people. I guess that's what my dream is now. T-toma! It's shining so brightly, I'm being blinded! This is much too blinding! Um, would you mind? Yes? Yes, that's right. Yes. Eh? You mean it?! Th-thank you very much! Y-yes! All right! My audition... I passed... my audition. I'm going to get my debut! Hooray! Hooray! That means, how awesome! You'll be a pro! Will you be on TV? Huh? TV? Then, you'll be just like kanamin? That's amazing! Kanamin? This is something we definitely have to celebrate! Oh, mm-hmm. I know! We'll go and have a fancy dinner, right now! Arisa, come with us! Huh? But... That's okay, right, toma? Huh? Your audition... Does it have anything to do with that endymion thing? Mm-hmm. My song has been chosen to be used as the theme song for their campaign. I know what it is! It's the elevator that goes to space, right? So then, arisa, are you going to space? I'm still not sure about that. It sounds like there's going to be an opening ceremony. Give me a break, already! Excuse me! Some fried oysters and... hmm? Arisa, your wish has reached god, huh? Mm-hmm. You see, I seem to have good luck. This thing now is really thanks to my good luck. No it isn't. Huh? Success is something... That only comes to those unafraid to stand in the batter's box... And swing the bat as hard as they can, hoping to get a hit! Whoops. You're not convincing us at all, toma. Well, my bad luck is pretty hardcore, after all. But you were chosen because of your ability. I think that's something you can be proud of. Toma... The next one's coming! Ah, it's been a long time since I've had so much fun. Thank you very much for hanging out with me. I-I'm a level 0, too, you know. When I think of someone trying to make their dreams come true, it's kind of inspiring. Oh, toma. Yeah, yeah! When I see someone working hard toward their future, it cheers me up! It means that you have to try hard, too, miss index, huh? Mm-hmm. Wait, that sounded rude. I'm already working in the fine profession of being a sister! Do you want me to take that as you picking a fight with the entire english puritan church, toma?! Why are you suddenly blowing this out of proportion? This is a personal matter, isn't it? You could help out with the housework once in a while. Be quiet! Eating is my job! Stop acting like you're all that! Do you even consider yourself to be a sister?! What? That was a pretty melody. I really like it. That was in one of the songs I downloaded. Does it have any lyrics? I'm still making them up. Thank you so much for today. I'll be sure to let you know when my debut concert is, okay? Yeah. We're looking forward to it. Undine, by the symbol of the chalice, that which is distilled from all things... W-what the...? Is that...? Watch yourself, toma! It's a spell that uses a water element! Which means, they must be magicians! Keep back, both of you! Mallybath, slow him down! The ground! Janel Who are you people? What do you think you're doing?! Was that... Spell intercept! That's... Master... Why did you act on your own? I told you to wait for my order. Hey, stiyl! What's the big idea here?! Fortis 931! Your magic name?! Are you serious?! What are you waiting for?! Seize her! Arisal Your right hand can't eliminate matter. Toma! No! Stop! What just happened? What?! Evade them! What is that? We are the civil conflict resolution and relief patrol, under authorization from academy city's governing board. We are now commencing a special intervention. Stiyl! If this disturbance gets any larger, there's going to be trouble. Fall back! Marie! Mallybath! Jane! Right! Not bad. Hey, wait! Why are you after arisa?! She has the potential to start a war between our side of magic, and the side of science. A war? Hey, what do you mean by... W-who are you people? We are engaged in specialized activities, in order to maintain order in academy city. That doesn't tell me anything! Are you foes of that girl, or are you on her side? The combat we just went through is part of our commissioned duty. That doesn't answer my question! I'm warning you, do not get involved with her. If you become too friendly with her, you will die. Arisa? Oh, are you awake? Where am 1? At home. This is toma's home. This isn't my home! Uh, I mean, more precisely, it's the school's dorm. Dorm? By the way, was there anything familiar about them? Like who those people were? Mm-hmm! It's only natural that she wouldn't know. After all, that was magi... Yeah, ma-ma-major power from something not entirely explainable with just science, huh? That's for sure. Toma, do you believe in it, too? Huh? I-in what? Hmm... That there's a mysterious... Power-like thing not understood by science. Well, esper abilities can be mysterious powers, as far as that goes. Yeah, um... sorry. Arisa, do you wish there was such a power? The truth of the matter is, I have it. Huh? Huh? It's only when I'm singing songs, but it appears I have some kind of unquantifiable power. Even now, I get examined regularly at kirigaoka, but as it turns out, they aren't sure what it is. I wonder, is the fact that people listen to my songs because of this power, maybe? No! If it were like that, then my right hand would... I mean... He's right! Arisa, your songs are for real! Thank you. You know what? I wanted to make everyone happy with my songs. I figured that by singing, I would become happy, myself. But... If someone were to get hurt because of them, then... Hey, don't tell me that despite passing your audition, you're thinking of backing out? I just mean, wanting to sing is ultimately a selfish wish of mine. And if something like what happened earlier comes up... And if anything happens to those around me as a result... So you're just going to give up? You're going to cave in to those who come at you with force, and give up on your dream? Tell me, what do you really want to do? I want to sing. After all, that's all I have. Then go ahead and sing. If there's something you want to do, and you have the power to do it, then you have to do it. So let's think of some way to let you sing safely. Mm-hmm. In that case, arisa, you can stay here for a while. Huh?! The magicians aren't likely to make any moves in public. Besides, if it comes to it, you and I are both here, toma. Okay? Will you do that? Magic? Aah! She means the enemy! As long as you're here, they won't attack! You don't mind? It does seem to be the best solution. All right! What's a houseguest or two, plus a cat? I, as a kamijo, am glad to welcome you in! Yes. The enemy used indeterminate abilities. Abilities, huh? Still, these days, they can come up with any number of different abilities, right? Especially in this city. I believe these enemies to have power of a quite unusual variety. I would think your ability to control rare earth is plenty unusual as it is, shutaura. I don't mean unusual simply in terms of being few in number. Meigo arisa was attacked, exactly as you said. Just who am I dealing with? Oh, are you unable to fight unless you know? By the way, are you sure this line is safe? I'm sensing some noise. Noise? Oh, yes of course. How's that? Is the noise gone? Yes. It is? That's good. All right, if you would escort her again tomorrow, please. Right. Listen here, kami! The best part about getting behind an idol is getting in on the ground floor ahead of time! Especially these days, with girls like arisa suddenly getting hot! You take your eyes off of her for an instant, and just like that, she becomes a major deal! In this world, you really can't get distracted for even a second! Is that a fact? Hmm? Kami, you seem to be in exhausted mode today. I didn't get enough sleep. I've got another houseguest staying with me since yesterday. All of my pillows and blankets have been taken from me. Not enough sleep... Pillows... All taken away... Hmm? What's the matter? Okay, everyone, take your seats! Class is starting. Hmm? Kamijo, you are not looking well at all. Skimping out on sleep will not do. Then, is it okay if I sleep? Anyone who asks that gets to start remedial classes today. Let's get through them together, okay, kamijo? So you see, toma always treats me like a child. Couldn't that be because you're so cute, index? Huh? Did you say something? Listen, under the circumstances, I have to ask... Index, your relationship with toma... What is it? Toma makes the food for me, and I eat it. Also, whenever I get into trouble, he always helps me out, I guess. Appearances aside, toma is actually pretty incredible. Mm-hmm. You sure are a strange pair. Still, you're kind of neat, too. Arisa? Arisa? What's the matter? Just a second. I thought of some lyrics. Is that right? So that's how you make a song, then? Let me see, let me see! No! It's too embarrassing! Eh? No fair, arisa! I'll show you when I'm done. Then we can sing it together. Okay? Yeah, okay! Promise me, all right? I'm ho... Toma?! Toma! Just my luck!! Tomorrow? Mm-hmm. I'm discussing my contract with the orbit portal people. For real? I have to sit through a remedial class. I can't imagine any way I can get there in time. Entrusting this to her instead would just make me worry that much more. Say, arisa, isn't there anyone else you can turn to, who might be able to go with you? Yoo-hoo! Sorry to keep you waiting! Huh? Orbit portal is the company that had the Orion accident three years ago? Yes. When the space plane, on which the fate of the company had been staked, came down, they were about to go bankrupt. But immediately following that, they were bought out, and had a miraculous recovery. They made endymion there a reality. And incidentally, the company president is a girl. About ten years old, if I remember correctly. Huh? You mean, at the time, she was only seven? She is just a showpiece, is she not? I mean, a "goth-loli beauty-queen president" of all things is so over the top, it already sounds fishy. Oh, not as much as bandaged, twin-pony-tailed wheelchair girl does. Uiharu...! So... and this is just an urban legend... But there are stories that say she's just a promotional hologram, or a robot, or something. Ha! What a load of bunk. It may not be altogether false. Don't you think she could be incredibly doll-like in appearance? Misaka, what's the matter? Oh, this doll just seems so... I like... your songs. I haven't liked anything so much since Jenny lind. Good luck to you. Was that just...? I'm arisa. It's a pleasure to meet you. It's a pleasure to meet you. Nice to meet you. Nice meeting you. Thanks for your help. Oh? Who are you? O-oh, I-I'm miss arisa's manager. Hmm... you're her adorable fan club. Okay! Let's do this, please! Sorry to have you tag along this far with us.

Evacuate immediately! All other units, lead meigo arisa away... An explosion?! Kuroko! Got it! Here we go! I can't handle all of this! Everyone, judgment! Is there anyone who is injured? Are you okay? Y-yeah. That was a close call. Thank goodness. If that had been off by even a little... It really is a miracle. Yeah, it is a miracle. It's a miracle! Hey, get off of me. Hey! Meigo arisa is safe, then? How many dead? Zero?! I see. All right. Awake, are you? Where are we? Don't strain yourself. What about arisa and the others up above? They're safe. Huh? Both the spectators, and meigo arisa. What about the rest of your people? My... the black crow force are all uninjured. That truly is miraculous, huh? Do not speak that word in front of me! This chance outcome just happened to go in that direction! The only thing here is a random quantum-mechanical deviation, and the warped desire of people seeking a fortuitous outcome! People are indolent and foolish. There's no such thing as an expedient "unseen hand." I get it. You're a hard-as-tacks leader. But have you actually ever listened to her songs? Give them a listen. You may actually believe in miracles. Thanks to an accident, my brain has lost the ability to recognize music. Apparently, the ability to process sound pitch and rhythm was the only thing that I lost. For me, a song is nothing but a monstrous noise, contaminating the ears. I'm sorry. You're... shutaura. Shutaura sequenzia. Shutaura, I'm... Why are you apologizing? I'm content with who I am now. As a result, I'm able to get by without being taken in by songs, or words such as "miracle." Here is more news on the bombing of the 7th school district shopping mall. There was an explosion in the facility under the shopping mall, and the cause is still under investigation.

But there was not a single fatality... They say it's a miracle. Yeah, it is. A miracle? Arisa is awesome! It's a miracle. A miracle! Are you all right? Toma... It seems weird, huh? If it really were a miracle, then the incident wouldn't have happened to begin with, would it? Put that way, maybe so. I'm getting so that I don't understand this. Long ago, I was apparently in another big accident. Apparently? I don't have any memories of anything before three years ago. Even my name was given to me by someone at the facility. So I don't have anything that I can call my own. But when I'm singing songs, at least, my heart is warmed, and there's something that Wells up inside. As long as I have my songs, I feel like I can someday take back whatever it is that I've lost. I sort of understand what you mean. At least you have something you believe in. Which means, I'm sure you'll be fine. Coming up in two days is endymion's unveiling ceremony, isn't it? Yes. On that day, I trust that our company will do all that it can to show all of you just what a miracle really is.

Today is my treat. Have whatever you want. Really? Oh, waitress! Yes! Wow! Her, of all girls! Leave it to you, kami. The thing is, tsuchimikado, you know the reason why arisa is being targeted, don't you? She is a Saint. Or at least, she is viewed to have the same degree of power as one. Kanzaki... She's provisionally ranked ninth. If she were to fully come around, there's a chance her power would top mine. Arisa is a Saint?! Well, that's still just a supposition. Nothing has actually been proven. Tsuchimikado, what is your opinion? I'm not quite sure. Defining saints has always been imprecise to begin with. Maybe if you were to let me investigate you closely from your head down to your tippy-toes...! Y-you must be joking! Be that as it may, apparently, academy city wants to take her natural gifts and abilities, analyze them anatomically, and then exploit them. Particularly that loli company president. Here. They're the lyrics to that song. We promised to sing them together, right? Let's celebrate with a drink, arisa! Thanks. Cheers! Wow, the three-legged race? And with miss misaka, at that! Yes. She was so insistent, and I couldn't very well turn her down... Huh? What the...? W-what is going on here?! Huh? What are you saying? Index? What's up? Huh?! Arisa?! Crow leader to crow 4, sitrep. Target is on the expressway. Don't let them out of your sight. There's no such thing as miracles. I won't stand for it! Um, master? Hmm? You can't smoke in the car. It stunts your growth. I don't mind. I'm plenty tall as it is. No, not you! I'm talking about me! Incoming! Marie, don't let them pass us! Okay! Master! Here! Innocentius! They're up ahead. Teacher, please hurry! 1-1 know! Whew... ugh... -Ow... Stop! Why are you jumping the gun, stiyl?! There's still no proof that the girl is a Saint, is there? Kanzaki... I just got new orders. Do you know what that is? A space elevator, right? No. The sumerian ziggurats; The tower of babel... When architecture takes on a scale that exceeds rationality, at the same time, it also takes on magical implications. The trouble is, there are those who would also involve a Saint, and try to turn it into a grand-scale magical instrument. Just a minute. Are you saying there is someone in academy city who is trying to use magic?! It's me. Antiskill is on the move. Withdraw. Acknowledged. No... it can't be... Oh, found out about that, have we? Fine. Bring the girl back to me. Stay back! Shutaura! Let the girl go! Shutaura! It's not even any of your business! Why are you interfering?! This is bad! Run, kamijo toma! Miss saten? Hello? What's up? Mm-hmm... mm-hmm... Huh?! Miss arisa?! Yes. They say that it's almost certain that she was abducted. Mm-hmm... mm-hmm... All right. I'm heading out right now. Who is this girl? Why does she have this bracelet? Sure enough, you two are drawn to each other. On that day, there were eighty-eight passengers and crew aboard the Orion. And following the accident, there were eighty-eight confirmed survivors. Everyone said it was a miracle. But the truth is, there was a single casualty... The Orion's pilot, daedalus sequenzia. Yes, your father. But by the time that fact was confirmed, it was too late. The world was caught up by the miracle. The eighty-ninth survivor had been covered up, and only the miracle remained. The girl who suddenly appeared on the plane which only had eighty-eight people aboard, and worked that miracle, is this girl, right here. Are you going to persist in calling it a miracle? Well, the truth is, nobody should have survived the accident. You don't mean... I thought it would work better in space. However, except for your father, everyone else survived. And, it did produce an unexpected by-product, so in one sense, I guess it was a success. It was you? It was because of you...? Who are you? You're that guy from before! Are you through yet? I think that's the sixteenth time ll've been stabbed with a knife. You're a monster! Oh, am 1? I may be, generally speaking, but you two are something else, yourselves. I'll let you live. Watch closely as the true miraculous moment takes place. Whoever you are and whatever you're planning, I swear I'll bring it down! I swear it! I look forward to it. Take her away. Now then, that just leaves you. Good morning. I need a favor from you, miss meigo arisa. Those with ticket numbers 2033 through 2152, please embark on the no. 17 linear track. Coming up tomorrow is the grand unveiling ceremony, and guests for the ceremony are rolling into endymion. So then, it's true. Mm-hmm. Arisa never came back. I've checked around here and there, too. I see. Listen... toma... My word, this is a serious burn. Are you that intent on setting a new admittance record here? Uh, no, it's not like... Hi, kami! Can we have a second? Crow 7 to all units, infiltration into the system successful. We're going to settle all this. Settle this? Ladylee tangleroad was originally someone on our side, a Sybil, who specialized in Greek divination. She is trying to construct a spell with meigo arisa at its core. A super-colossal one, which uses endymion. Something in a class that would wipe out the whole northern hemisphere if it were ever activated. Anyhow, as long as the problem is a magical one, this falls within our territory. You guys keep out of it. Are you sure you can handle it? We're talking outer space. We'll deal with the core. And if it comes down to it, we'll destroy the tower itself. When you say you'll deal with the core, you mean you'll kill arisa? Well, that is what it means. The thing about arisa is, she has a dream, and she is putting all of her effort into pursuing it. Why should a girl like her have to be treated like a villain, who is out to destroy the northern hemisphere?! Toma! You shouldn't be up and around yet! There's no time for talk like that now. Whether we leave it to magic or science, arisa will get killed! You're as big a fool as ever. Wait, toma! Toma, I say! You're as big a fool as ever. We thought you might say that, so we got something ready for you. "Stare." "Mm-hmm, I see. It sounds like this is big trouble," says misaka misaka, intentionally whispering in a loud voice. Ugh... pipe down! That's too loud to be talking to yourself. Sheesh... Say, I bought some drinks. Want one? Wait... Why, that little...! Everyone else except for your father survived. If that isn't a miracle, then what is it? Sorry to keep you waiting. Sitrep. Ladylee and the others are already off to space. The operation has advanced to phase 4. An antiskill squad is approaching endymion. Are we ready to go up? Yes, we are. Captain... I'm going to go settle this. Don't send anyone else up after me. I'm off. We are now temporarily shutting down the network to adjust the relay circuits for the ceremony. Please wait just a moment until service is restored. A miracle... I wonder if you would sing for me your miracle song? Toma... Have you still not decided? And after I gave you, who sang on sidewalks, such a big stage... If you don't want to, you can always refuse. In that case, all of the guests who are here will end up dying. I'll sing. But it won't be for my dream, nor will it be for your dream. My song will be for everyone who is genuinely looking forward to it. I will sing for those people. No matter what you are thinking, the miracle song... Will rise above it. What is this? A ballistic slider. It's the ill-fated new shuttle system that lost out as academy city's next mainstay space transport craft. Kami, this is what we're sending you up on! Huh? Where? Why, outer space, of course! What's up with the underground linear tunnels and payload routes? They are all sealed off. Which means... This bridge is the only thing we can use right now.

I must have lived a thousand years already... The Orion experiment may have failed, but in exchange, an unexpected byproduct came about. And that is arisa. With her miraculous power, I will be able to die. Come, let's end this together! Oh no you don't! Toma! Say, what was that just now? Right... it looks like there was an explosion near the elevator relay station. As a result, the stress balances are starting to come undone! Huh? But that means... If this keeps up, the elevator will collapse, and proceed to fall to earth! Huh?! What was that explosion? An accident? No way. I'm scared! Hey, this is outer space. Eh? What's going to happen to us? Whoa, are you all right?! This is bad, isn't it? Are we going to die? Huh? Seriously?! Yeah, we have to get out of here! I'm scared! We're done for! This is not good! Hey, don't push! Ow!

Just a little farther... Right over there... I've never seen a spell as crazy as this one. Are you trying to destroy the earth? All your lines refining your magical power are more than just a little off the rails. The list of prohibited books, right? I've heard of you. A human library, who has memorized 103,000 volumes of magic grimoires. You should be able to understand, right? The way it feels to be somebody cursed by magic? I can finally make my way out of this hell. No, you can't. Even if you do this, it won't kill you. I can tell. Why, you...! If we don't hurry this up, it will all be too late! Don't get careless! Master! Here they come! Toma! Don't do it, shutaura! Her existence is what gave rise to ladylee's plan. As well as its unseen casualty. Her songs... And the miracles she causes mislead people! That's why I'm killing her! Why? Why are you laughing?! Miss misaka, the blast bolt is after your next right. Acknowledged! What's the matter, miss misaka? Are you okay, master? Don't worry about me. It's just a scratch. Master, let us handle this. What are you talking about?! I will see the task I've been entrusted with through to the end! This is yomikawa. I'm sorry, but it doesn't look like I'm going to reach there in time. "It's all right. Please pay no mind, and continue to detonate on the three-count," requests misaka. Sissy...? Geez... Why do I have to come out and do something like this? "You see, you see, if endymion here falls down, the earth will be ruined, and no one will have anywhere to live," says misaka misaka, stating correct, yet obvious reasoning! Ha! The earth? Not that it's any of my business, but, this may be just the thing for my physical therapy. Sounds like there's no time for hesitation, huh? Here goes! Three! Two! What was that? Did they do it? Take cover! Don't tell me they're trying to purge endymion! Now I can do it... Unpack the layers of her spell, and find some way to collapse it! They detonated the base?! Now you see, don't you? There's no such thing as "can't"! My father, the pilot of the Orion, was the sole casualty of that accident. Even though I... and the other passengers... all survived... That's why I deny miracles! To carry on the will of my father, who didn't rely on miracles, and fought only with what he had! Your old man was trying to protect you and the other passengers. Even if the chances were less than one percent, as long as he pushed it to the limit, something would turn out. He must have believed that, and hung in there right to the end! Which is precisely the reason why you and the others lived, isn't it? A miracle happened. Your old man is the one who worked that miracle! And for you to deny that is the same as you killing your old man once again, isn't it?! Come on, answer, kami! Damn... Endymion really is going to fall. To hell with the miracle of the eighty-eight! To hell with miraculous songs! Go ahead and try to save us now! Try to save everyone from endymion falling down to the earth! Including her, and you, and everyone who accepts miracles that violate the natural order! Stop that! Even if you follow your way and deny miracles, it won't bring about order! Betting on even the slightest possibility, believing that you can gain something, and then making even a little bit of difference is what moving forward is, isn't it?! That's what your old man was aiming for, wasn't it? And isn't that exactly what a miracle is?! I'm going to take your miserable delusion and smash it with my right hand! Hey, shutaura... Music is a really great thing... "Remaining battery life has reached 0" damn... It's not... over yet... Are we okay? Oh, god... The left engine block has fallen away. I-It's hopeless! Don't give up! There's still something we can do! What is it? Hey! Please. I don't care if I lose everything precious to me. So right now, please work a miracle for everyone. That's right... Back there, I made a wish... I wanted a miracle, even if what I held precious was taken from me. And so... I was born.

If I had to say, she might have been a wish. A wish? Even if it is not the work of an esper, a person's wishes can distort their subjectivity. If multiple wishes are all given the same direction, their power can even interfere with causality. Master, you can't smoke inside this room. That power could divide a young girl, master, you can't smoke inside this room. And alter the fate of many people. And then, the distortion caused by the two becoming one again has worked its own miracle. Ladylee has performed quite the fascinating experiment for me. All in all, it is unfortunate that she cannot die. Say, toma, was arisa really...? No. I mean, I actually touched her, with my right hand. So she was not just some illusion. She was someone who liked songs, and who liked delighting others with her songs, and was otherwise just a normal girl. Mm-hmm, you're right. Toma, did you hear that, too? Yeah! Riding a train to our destination, we travel through the empty night sky a flip of a coin and a drop of a tear I want to get beyond this weeping night sky why is it that the view I see from my window is always as pretty as this, despite inside my body, inside my eye, it's twinkling even more, to the point of overflowing?
