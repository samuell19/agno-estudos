PARIS, OCTOBER 1977 I'm soaked now. Thanks! If you weren't there, he would've come back. Gosh, what an evening! I'm dripping everywhere. There are Kleenex in the back. I've used the whole box. I'm freezing. What a bastard! I can't believe it! What happened? Is there no heating? Give it 30 seconds. Don't give me that look. It's weird. We have an individual who's been injured... You're a cop? Been a naughty girl? Don't patronize me. - Got any ID? - My name is Aline. Aline Kaminker. - And you don't have your ID? - That Jaguar driver was attacking me. He's hit me before, but never this hard. - He's my boyfriend. - Is that true? - How old are you? - Just look! Look at the bruises he left! It's true! I'm not lying. It was just a little fight. Don't take me to the station. Sabatier here. Car 16-89-B. I'm on the corner of Boulevard Sulte. All quiet, heading back. - Over. Thanks. - Okay, copy. Where are we going? TO JIM Who was that in the Jaguar? You won't say? It's a secret? That's smart. No! No! Say something, goddammit! Defend yourself. What came over you? Do you know how old she is? Seventeen. You're a headcase. It takes a real idiot of a cop to... Kaminker, Aline. Born 21 November 1960, placed in the care of the state in the home of Mr. and Mrs. Beffroit. Beffroit... Ding ding, morning bells are ringing! You're screwed, Lucien. The Inspectorate won't hold back. You raped an orphaned minor. This is desperate. You'll get the max. Yes? No, I don't care about those damn journalists. Cordet, I want to be done with this. I'm exhausted. An orphaned minor. Wasn't it fucking obvious? Will you stop? I'm sick of your lectures. Okay, sure... Your wife and kids will be sick of this too. That's enough. Brunet? Brunet? Bring in the "ding-ding" family. Stay strong, Lucien. We're here. We won't abandon you. LA SANTÉ PRISON, SIX YEARS LATER Sabatier, free to go. You look well, Lucien. Good to see you on the outside. Are you bringing me money and a gun, Commissioner? District. District Commissioner Cordet, Crime Squad. - And you're replacing him? - No. I left the force for good. I've gone private, with Didier. - You'll be working with him. - Working? We said we wouldn't abandon you. You're six years late. I couldn't come any earlier. You got extra time because you were a cop and you're getting extra help now for the same reason. Don't be stupid, Lucien. It'll help you get back on your feet. Think of your wife and kids. Patricia has remarried, thanks, and I'd rather the boys forgot me. Imagine the mood when they start dating... No chance, Brunet. Thanks, guys, but I don't want hand-outs. Stubborn git! I'll let you think about it. THREE MONTHS LATER... Blimey! The bastard didn't waste any time. Nice figure on her. Drop the Langlois case. We're understaffed. Anything from the pool? I think the girl spotted me. Put Didier on it. He'll swim better. Didier? Yes? - Got swimming trunks? - Yes, why? You're going to the pool. Lucien will hand you the file. I set up an agency to avoid paperwork and just look... Why so miserable, Lucien? What's wrong, swallowed your tongue? No, just a flu. Try homeotherapy. There's nothing like it. Oscillococcinum before breakfast from day one. Anyway, Dujarric's waiting in Didier's office. It's a good case. Someone's copying clothing designs in the Sentier. You know the area. Don't say anything antisemitic there... One last thing: there's money in it. So don't do anything silly. Don't play dumb. Your pool story didn't fool me. In three months here, you've never given up a case. Isabelle, has my wife called? Yes. I left her message on Didier's desk. Hey, what's this about a swimming pool? - And there's a guy in my office for you? - It seems so. Mr. Sabatier? André Dujarric, sales director at Sarah Muriel. I'm listening. Excuse me. SAMUEL WEBER DRESSMAKING AND HOSIERY Thank you. Lucien! My brother! Give me five! Bring it in. Marcel, two Martinis. - Plain or with zest? - Plain. See, Lucien? Rony is free. - Since when? - A week, but I've moved on. How are you getting on? You look well! Working? Tailing people, but I'm a private detective. What are your plans? I'm back with my sweetheart. I put the company in her name obviously, after my trouble with false invoices. Now my girlfriend's the boss and I'm the warehouse worker. We did split up though. So I'm on rue Quincampoix now. How's your family? Is your wife still remarried? Clearly. You've lost the family guy look. Marcel, are you napping? It's my shout. We lived together. We never believed your predator stuff, because on your own, it's hard to rape a girl without a fight, so I just don't buy it. You haven't learned much. You still stare. Lucien, don't tell me you're staring at Ms. Weber. What? That's her? - That girl? - Quiet, it's like Ashkenaz here. - Is that girl Édith Weber? - She's definitely not a nobody! Similar, but very different. You non-Jews understand nothing. Now listen. We invented psychoanalysis, relativity, the class struggle. So here's some advice. That girl is taken. Forget her. Thanks, Rony. I have to go. Drop by my place. 37 rue Quincampoix. - Hi. - Hi! Hey, it was nice to see you. - Didier wants his office back. - I won't be long. I'm with Dujarric. I wanted to ask you for an intel report on him and a Ms. Édith Weber. W-E-B-E-R, like the musician. She has a shop at 11, rue du Croissant. It's urgent. Yes, Commissioner. - Feeling at home in my office? - I won't be much longer. - How did it go at the pool? - Swimmingly. Intel report. Only on the Weber girl. Don't bother with Dujarric. Chop-chop, it's urgent. Yes, Commissioner. She takes notes, sketches, just like a journalist would. But she isn't a journalist. And by night, what does she do? She stays at home. Above the shop, alone, which is a shame for someone so pretty. She goes to bed at 10:00 p.m. And I, too, go home alone. In my humble opinion, Mr. Dujarric, I'm afraid your suspicions are unfounded. Spare me your humble opinion. Others have complained too. Other designers have noticed her too. I'm sure she's stealing our designs. - Is your jacket one of them? - We only do women's clothes. Thought as much. Listen, Sabatier-- If she's stealing your designs, I'll catch her. Does that work? That works. But be warned... I'm not as stupid as I look. Aline. Antoine? Antoine? Oh! Lucien, fill me in. I haven't heard from you in days. Don't you worry. I was on stakeout every night. Every night? Find anything on the Sentier thief? She's not a thief. Got an intel report? I think Dujarric is paranoid. The client says she's guilty. We're just paid to collect proof. I have your intel. I haven't had time to get Dujarric's. Here it is. Édith Weber, born 13 July '55, central Paris, daughter of Samuel Jacob Weber and Viviane Édith... Anyway, you can read. So... any plans tomorrow night? New Year's party? Not much here. "Not much." You're funny. These are simple people. Her dad's address is there. How do you get to Ville d'Avray? Mr. Samuel Weber, please. What is it about? His daughter, Édith. Follow me, sir. Have a seat. Mr. Weber will be along shortly. Do you mind if I leave you on your own? - I have my flowers to tend to. - Sure, I'm in no hurry. Miss Édith Weber? Édith? Wherever she is, she can't hear you, sir. - Mr. Weber? - That's me. Excuse us, Madeleine. Sabatier. Private detective. I have some questions about your daughter... Édith. That's my daughter, Édith. When she was a little girl. That's who you saw upstairs. The other one... We took her in five years ago. She was being pursued. She needed a new name, a job, and somewhere to hide. I had no choice. I sold my shop and my daughter's birth certificate. We knew that someday someone would come. - Who told you? - No one. I was asked to tail her. She's suspected of stealing designs. Do you know who's after her? No, not at all. Everyone and no one. That's the nature of the Sentier. What will happen now? Mr. Weber, why did she need to change identity? No, I can't say. We don't know. Who paid you for your daughter's identity? Please. Stop your inquiries. At least tell me her name. Her first name. She must've had one when she first arrived. No. No, I won't say anything. Come in. I don't have much to offer you. A whiskey? Listen, Sabatier. It's New Year's Eve. I don't have much time. - What was so urgent? - I have some questions. Really? You don't want a drink? - Let's celebrate together. - If this is a joke, it stinks. Everything about this case stinks. The investigation... Ms. Weber... You. And especially your boss. - My boss? - Yes. Your boss. The one who paid for me to follow that girl. Now I need her name. I've already explained that. It's my company who... Well... we won't be plagiarized by a little backstreet crook... One perk of private work is being free to use one's own methods. So, her name... Mr. Dujarric? You won't believe me. Her name. - Her name! - It's her. The one you wanted. She paid and arranged everything. I just did as she said. I went to Brunet's agency... and paid for you to be assigned the case. Now let me go. If Madam is going to party, then let's go party. Édith. You're turning heads, darling. Don't look just yet, wait. He's giving you a look. - Which one? - I can't see him anymore. - Are you okay? - Yes, I'm fine. Just a bit hot. Midnight! Is Max here? But Sir has a game tonight, ma'am. Sir said no disruptions. They've only just started. Ma'am, please! You know he's not to be disturbed. Max, a word? Right now. Good evening, Édith. André, take my place. Excuse me, gentlemen. I shan't be long. It's happened. - What has? - He's found me, Max. What do we do now? Hang on. What are you talking about? You know perfectly well. No, Aline, I don't. I don't know a thing. You show up in the middle of the night. How long has it been? No, Max, no. Don't play that game. Don't do this to me. After all-- - After what, Aline? - Stop calling me that. Forgive me... Édith. Answer me. What will you do now? He recognized me. He knows who I am. He'll tell people. I'm scared, Max, do you hear? I'm scared. What are you talking about... Édith? Why get so worked up? Have you done something bad? Bastard. Bastard. You should never have left me. You're as guilty as me, Max. You're forgetting things. There were no witnesses, Édith. Only you... and me. You little tart! I knew you'd sneak out at night! Get out of there! - Get out! - Let go of me! Let go! - Hey, honey... Calm down, madam! - Shut up! The girl's far too young. How long has this been going on? You're coming home! - Right this instant! - No. Henri! Poor Henri. Look at your fella. Think he'll stay loyal? Look at him. - He's handsome. - Stop it. You cheap little tart. I knew what you were worth... you little whore. You had us believe you were raped, yet you're frolicking with this bastard. Your mother must be pretty, you're just like her. A bad seed! You... dirty Jew! Say that again. Repeat what you just said. Dirty Jew! Hey! That's not on! Forget it, Max. I'm never going back to their house. I love you, Max. Look at them, Henri. That little whore. Little ta-- I'll do anything you want, Max. Like before. Do you remember? You've aged, Aline. You used to be more adept. You used to handle men much better. Much better. Too late, Édith. A year ago, I would've done anything to get you back. But now I'm cured. Leave. I have a game to finish. I'll keep our secret safe. I think that's already a lot. Now you're going to talk. I want to understand. Let me in. I want to talk to you! Let me in, for God's sake! He'll come back, Max. Whether it's tomorrow or in a year. Six years, he's been waiting. Do you see? Is this your latest collection? Too chic. And too subtle... for your clientele. What will we do, Max? Go get some sleep. You need to help me. This time, I can't manage alone. Come. Hold me. Hold me tight. If only you knew how much I missed you. You're mine. Mine, and mine alone. I don't want to go to prison. Get rid of him for me. Come. I'll do it. Swear it, Max. Swear it. I swear. No one will ever know. - You'll never leave me, Aline. - No. - Never again. - I love you, Max. I love you. I love you. Rony. - Let me in. It's me, Lucien. - Yeah, yeah, I'm coming. - Rony! - Yes! What happened to you, Lucien? Take a seat. What happened, Lucien? Did she fight you off? Bill posters driven by a man in a big black Jaguar. What's that about? You're off to a great start. You need to see a doctor. - I know a discreet one. - I'll be fine. It's mainly my shoulder that hurts. So, the guy in the Jaguar? You know the Sentier scene. The fashion industry's a world of its own. Rony, spare me the lecture. Just tell me. Max. - Max who? - Mr. Max. How's he linked to Édith Weber? I warned you, forget it, Lucien. Mr. Max is dangerous. He's a big shot. His world is illegal. His employees, companies... It's all underground. Is the Weber shop under his protection? If you don't have protection in the Sentier, shalom! When did the girl take over the shop? I don't know. I was on vacation back then... with you. Before I got arrested, I knew Samuel Weber. He handed the shop to her. She's brave. Being alone in the Sentier is no picnic. Have you heard the name Dujarric? Dujarric? Yes. He drives for Mr. Max, and other big bosses too. Does he drive the Jaguar? They're all bogus companies, the taxis he drives. Fake receipts to claim VAT, the Sentier cotton mill, the Chapelle fiduciary, and so on... I'll say one thing: your Dujarric... he didn't mind my overtime. But he's a hard nut, in a big way. It's no place for us, brother. That's why I, Rony, work in fur. And you... Stick to spying on cheating husbands. Stop, Lucien. I'll look after you here. We're used to each other. Thanks, Rony, but without a guard at the peephole, keys in locks make me uneasy. Miss Édith? Miss Édith? Are you there? Mr. Max! Quietly! Keep calm. She's asleep. - She needs to rest today. - Mr. Max... If I'd known you were coming... And you? Working on January 1st? No, it's a surprise. We thought she'd be alone on New Year's Day. The girls are coming with cake at midday and I'm here early to prepare... but you being here changes everything. At midday, you say? I'll come. But don't tell her that. You didn't see me. - Not a word. - See you later. I'll send someone to fix the window. Oh, darling. Mummy will be right with you. It's funny, being my wife's lover. Please stop that. You still won't see them? No. I think it's best for them. And for me too. It's not that simple, Lucien. Shit, my arm hurts. I may have sprained something. Ooh, that's not pretty. - They've forgotten me. - Not the eldest. He knows Paul isn't his father. Shit, that burns. Gently... You're the one who left. When I see him there... I'm sorry, but some days it's tough. - And today? - What about today? Apart from my care and affection, what did you come here for? Some help. It's her, I'm sure of it. Whatever happened to Aline Kaminker? What if I asked you to forget all that? Have you seen the state you're in? Give the Beffroits your best wishes and ask for news of Aline. It's New Year's Day, after all. Patricia, please. I can't go to their house. It's no use, Lucien. There's no one there. What? I... I should've told you ages ago. While you were in prison, the Beffroits died. Both of them. Murdered. She's been wanted for five years. It was probably her who killed them. You bastard. - Lucien... - Why didn't you mention this murder? What would it have changed? Commissioner Cordet handled the Beffroit case. He moved heaven and earth to get that case. Hadn't he earned it? So you organized a little vendetta? Such police honor. If we found the girl, maybe you'd have had a chance. She'd have been a criminal. But Cordet never found her. I've found her. How? She's Édith Weber, the girl from the Sentier. Shit. Are you sure? How much were you paid? How much? And by whom? I couldn't guess, Lucien. A guy called the agency and said Dujarric would pay me to assign you the case. "A personal matter," he said, and clients are king. Shit, Lucien... - Shit, had I known-- - Hey, don't cry over it. Anyway, you got your money. Besides it's great publicity, outperforming the police. No. This is too big. Murder cases go to Crime Squad. I'll call Cordet... No, Brunet. This is my case. I'll finish it alone. Give me a few days. - What will you do? - There's one guy behind it all. A determined man. He won't go quietly. Give me three days. Six years, I've waited. You have 48 hours. Thanks, Antoine. You're putting me at risk, so please be careful. Don't forget... that... That I'm a rapist. There's no danger of that. Happy new year! - Happy new year! - Here, for Yvette. For Yvette, for Yvette! - Here, Yvette. Happy new year. - Happy new year! - It's practically a baptism. - Happy new year. One for me. There we go. To your health, darling. Well, happy new year! Myriam, I haven't had a kiss. Excuse me, I'll be back. Have you been here long? We agreed tonight, Max. I wanted to see you. Do you like them? You remembered well. Are you staying here long? I have something to show you. A surprise? You'll see. Look how they stare at you. They think you're beautiful. Don't be scared. No one understands French here. Come on. See? The new laws haven't changed a thing. There will always be exiled people, illegal immigrants. Right, Édith? All the games I've won, all the risks I've taken, it's all for you. Without you, it's meaningless. A man needs a woman to work. I'm glad you came back. Look at them... All at work, even on New Year's Day. They trust me. Max protects them. Max feeds and shelters them. Max controls them. Hi, Nando, how are you? Good, thanks. How are you, Mr. Max? Good. I've brought the documents you asked for. Plus an ID card for Akim. - Thanks so much. - Not at all. Here. Tell them Mr. Max came by to give them their New Year's gifts and that he wishes them a happy new year, and their families too. - Mehmet. - Thank you. Erhan? Thank you. - Ali? - Thank you. - Suleyman? - Thank you. - Ismail? - Thank you. - Ahmet? - Thank you. Recep? - Thank you. - Şükrü. Thank you. - Hilmi? - Thank you. Fevzi? You see, Édith, - Hasan? - I got everything I wanted. - Ibrahim? - Thank you. But I'd give it all up for you. Say the word, Édith, and we'll leave together. We'll leave all this behind. We'll go and live in the sun. I've made all the preparations. I have enough money for us to live wherever you like. Whenever you like. But... why would we run away? Why leave everything behind? I don't know. Because... Well, because of him. He found you, didn't he? It was you? You set him on my trail? Aline... Will you marry me? You have no choice. Yes, I do. You said so yourself: he recognized you. He wants to know why you changed your name. We could help him find out why. What of it? Aline! Five years ago, you killed. Aline Kaminker, had you forgotten? Now we're going to kill again, but you know that. Thanks, Antoine. - You warned her? - He and the radio did. - Come on, Lucien... - Hi, Cordet. Any news? - Still nothing, but she's not downstairs. - Then where is she? We don't yet know, but we'll find her. - Sorry, Lucien, but I had to... - Brunet's right. Don't be mad at him. You chased the lead like a cop, now it's our turn. Sure, use me and lose me. Excuse me, I have a friend to see. - Hi, Bérot. - Hi, Lucien. Shame, it was a lovely shop. You should've seen it in '36 when I first got here. I painted it brown. Not a somber brown. A shiny, chestnut brown, you see? And now look. Mr. Weber, I think they have questions to ask you. Yes, I know, I know, as expected. Have you any idea where she is? Even if I did, do you think I'd tell you? Mr. Weber, we need your assistance. I'm happy to help, gentlemen. What? Are you taking me in too? - Lucien... - Listen. Cordet and I thought that... Yeah... there are people behind this girl, bad people. So, the commissioner and I thought... Your service weapon. I'll turn a blind eye. Is my funeral sorted too? RESTAURANT MOROCCAN SPECIALTIES Fires happen all the time in that industry. You may tap into the insurance, but that's life. But Édith Weber's shop was doing fine. Not everyone has a love interest to pay one's suppliers. You mean Max? She supposedly left to go independent, but I reckon he was still helping. He was crazy about her. - "Independent"? - Ignore her, she's drunk. You smell of the motherland, honey. What does that mean? Only locals understand. - Is Max a local? - No, he's from Naples. Come on, Lucien. Forget this Max guy. You're not here for that. Eh, darling? Why the hell are you here? Have you lost your mind? If you want to yell at me, yell at me at home. Let's not wake everyone up. Thank you. He's upstairs. It was bound to happen. Don't give me that. You got me once. Wasn't that enough? Now get the hell out. Take your bag and clear off! Hang on a second! Please. Help me, I beg you. At least hear me out. I didn't realize at first. I thought you were out to get revenge. I didn't know Max had engineered it all. - I don't know what you know about-- - I know nothing. Nor am I interested in you, Max, or your schemes. You burn down your shop, run off, turn up here. What next? They won't look for me here. It buys me time to think. What about me? Do I even exist? Care to ask my opinion? I thought that... you'd be okay with it. And why would I help you? You put me in prison for six years. Why should I give a shit? Sort things out with Max and leave me alone. I want to forget all of this. That's all I want. To forget. To forget. To forget you. Liar. Let me stay for a few days. Just while I think. I have money. I'll find a solution. Fake documents... contacts. Then you'll never hear from me again. At my age, you can start over at least once or twice. Don't laugh at me... It's not my fault I'm like this. It's mine, is it? No, stop it! Stop it! We don't have to... But why... why can't we just talk to each other normally? I wonder why. Oh, stop it. So, would you like some tea? Something warm? Can I stay the night? At least one night. It sounds like you don't have a choice. No. Besides... I had to come here. Aline, step aside. Aline! I'll kill her. I'll kill her. I'll kill her. I'll find you, Aline. I'll find you, I promise. What are you saying? I can't hear. Well? What are you waiting for? Don't you want to anymore? I've paid enough. Don't you think? I've paid enough now. This lighting is dreary. I hope this will be enough. You need a passport to leave France. I need to go, anywhere. Anywhere the sun shines. It's something you'll carry with you... so the sun might as well be shining. What will I do? What? What do you want? What's come over you? Are you scared? Is that why your heart's beating so fast? You're shaking. I want you. Say it again. Say it again. Say it again! I want you. I want you. Is that what you wanted? Is that it? Yes. That's what I wanted. Since the start. It's nearly morning. I'm leaving now. I've taken the cash and photos. I'll be back by tonight with a passport for you. After that, we'll leave together. Until then, stay right here. What? No. Nothing. The farmhouse... The Weber stock room... Gosh, Lucien, this is madness. Édith Weber? No forgers will want to go near this. It's Max who controls all the channels you'd need. And Max is on the run, so I hear. The Sentier's closing ranks. I know. You're all covering for that scumbag. Was that girl the other night in on it too? Listen, Lucien... Don't bother, Rony. I might as well cut out the messenger. - Tell me where Max is hiding. - Lucien, are you insane? You can't be here. Max hates you. Why would he give you her passport? Because I have Édith. Where is he? I don't know. Only he knows. Listen, brother. Come here. Come... I'll sneak you out the back way. Leave the Sentier. His men are everywhere. If you're spotted, Max'll know. That's what I want. Place du Caire. What? Listen... Go to Place du Caire, someone will pick you up. Here. Go through there. Get in. Quick. - I was expecting anybody but you. - Well, here I am. It's this one. Right, well... see you. Don't turn around. Hands on the wall, to your right. You wanted to see me? I'm listening. - I need a passport. - For whom? I have the photos in my pocket. Going on holiday? I'm retiring. Thanks to you. What about her? Leaving her behind would be dangerous. The night of the murder, were you there? She has to leave. Otherwise you'll never be safe. Anywhere. Mustachioed or not. I've never liked safety much. I didn't need it. - You don't want to help her? - It's not the first time I've helped her. Everything's ready. I've had it made out to Mrs. Mathilde Varenni, née Klenès. And I'm Mr. Varenni. It's not you she's leaving with. Oh really? She's leaving with me. With you? Mathilde? Did you hear that? Mathilde? Forgive me. I hadn't introduced you to Mathilde. The name suits her. Don't you think? Mathilde... Édith or Aline, a whore is a whore. - Watch your mouth. - You buy her and she sells you out. Ignore him, Max, it's nonsense. You can't claim rape this time. - Do you want details? - Rapist. You did it again? You slept with him again? No, nothing happened. Rapist! Don't lie, or I'll kill him. Our last fuck cost me six years. So go ahead. What are you waiting for? No, Max! I love him. Wait for me outside. Are you coming? No. You'll need this. Thanks, but I'll manage. I don't know if she left with Max. I stayed in that room until nightfall. Outside, it started raining. I returned to Paris where I began waiting for her. Subtitle translation by: Lucy Harford
