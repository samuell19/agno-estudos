On the director's demand, this film is presented in its previously unseen, restored original version. (bright triumphant music) (water burbling) (upbeat music) THE FEMALE EXECUTIONER - [Dom] Do you know what you are? Then say it. You're nothing but a little slut. - [Sub] Yes, I am, I'm a slut. - [Dom] You like this, don't you? I know you do, huh? You're going to enjoy every minute of it. (Sub moans) Louder girl. (Sub moans) Louder I said. You're not bad looking you know. (Sub moans) Yes. - That's it buddy, take 'em away. - It's now or never, men. - [Police Officer] We're dead on target. - What do you know. (suspensive music) - You missed, you mother fucker. (man chuckles) Try again mother, come on. Oh, this is fun. Run your heart out, you cunt. (suspensive music) (metal rattling) (helicopter rotor whirring) (man groaning) - [Martine] Take a whiff, cleans up your mind. (bullets whizzing) (machine gun rattling) - [Captain] What the hell is going on Valmont? What's all the shooting about? Come in Valmont. - Come on. - [Captain] Do you hear me? What's going on? - Lieutenant Valmont, new boy on the beat, let's see. - I can tell you what's in it. Sadism, zoophilia, that's making it with animals, child porn, ain't pretty. But you had no call to shoot him full of holes. - He's been pedaling shit for months, right under your nose. No bullets? - They weigh down my handbag. - You ain't heard the last of this. - Are you out of your mind or what? - All I did was rap him one. - Yes, you did. - And if you don't tell me where you find the girls, there's more coming. (upbeat euro disco music) - [Croupier] Place your bets. The bets are down, no more bets. (ball rattling) - Double gin. - They tell me you took a grand worth of chips. - What's it to you? - Nothing, except you lost. And you still owe them three thou'. What I'd like to know is, how they let you run up that big a bill? - I need a bit more time, that's all. - You'd lose that too brother. Somebody over there wants to talk to you, ask you a couple of questions, if you don't mind. - Nadine Wenders, I presume you have some idea about who I am. - Everybody knows who you are. - May I introduce my brother? Luigi, a gambling man. - Ah, so that's Luigi. How does he plan to pay back the money he owes? - I got two ways out, I wash dishes for you for 20 years, or I make it back and play my last 10 bucks. - Ah, cut it out, you'd manage to lose, even if you bet on the sun rising tomorrow morning. - I've got a third way out for you, Luigi. I need somebody like you to kidnap somebody. - Thank you, but that ain't my bag lady. - I can take on four like you, and lay them out dead side-by-side. (Martine moaning) (soft piano music) - I'm a bit hungry, you got something to eat? - How are you? - Oh. - Why hide it? - You're... - I'm her sister, and you're her lover I suppose. You're running true to type, you know. My sister only goes for short brown haired men, who are shy, may 1? - [Martine] Joelle, this is no time to get home. No, I'm not staying either. Life is like beautiful, I'm having a ball. If it were up to me, I'd go out, enjoy the weather, but I have a class, ciao and have fun. - [Martine] Would you mind telling me where you spent the night? - What do you know, the lady cop is working overtime. I was at the Midnight club with some friends, and I've got a witness. It was fun, but nobody got his hands below the belt, ciao lovers, - No hands below the belt. - Tell me how many short brown-haired men did you lay on that couch? - Counting you 1,001. (lovers chuckle) (telephone ringing) - [Police Officer] Is that you Sarge? - Yeah, it's me. - How are you? Sorry to disturb you, but well, I've got a snitch who wants to talk. - Lay him on whoever's around. - She doesn't want to talk to anyone, but you. - You got her name? - Yeah, Blake, like William Blake, the philosopher. (upbeat techno music) - Hi, thought it was your day off. - Can I see you later? - Yeah, later. Hi, did she call back? - What's that? - [Martine] Get your feet off. - You mean? - [Martine] I mean Blake, you nit. - No, no, but if that is I, I mean, who is she? - She works with some broad that goes by the name of Wenders, at the Cloister. - Ah, I wouldn't trust her to give me the time of day. - I trust her. - [Partner] Me, the only information I trust is when my mother's rheumatism tells her it's gonna rain. - [Martine] That's funny now get me the file on Mrs. Wenders. International bus station - Madam Wenders, I, we got us a dilly here. I used to tap phones before I landed here. We hooked into her line because, because of a sex show or a peep show involving a minor, she used to be a lady pimp. Now she's tied in with a Chinese in some kind of racket. She's what I call the big game ah-uh. (Martine whistles) - If you want to bring down an elephant, you take dead aim on a soft spot. (telephone rings) Oh, that's right. Who is this? - It's Blake, Mrs. Wenders is gonna kidnap some kid at St. Mary's College tomorrow morning. - Now, what did I tell ya? If it weren't for stoolies, the police would be hamstrung. Come in Robert, do you read me? If you do come on in. Well I say, I've got a problem. I think the battery's dead. - You're supposed to change them once in a while. - Why don't you get some help? You're not supposed to go it alone. - Since we're going to work together, there's one thing you should know, I might as well tell you now. I'm the one who decides. - Here, I'll be that's your snitches snatchers. - That's a piss-poor pun. - Maybe, the ambulance gambit, it's a classic. - Yeah, in books. - Come on, what do we do? Shouldn't we phone the Dean or something? Clue him in on what's happening. - No, I wanna catch Mrs. Wenders red-handed. I'm told she stays around to keep an eye out. Go check his ID. - Why does it always have to be me? - Because I've seen him somewhere, and he may recognize me, and stop arguing every time I ask you something. - Police, would you be so kind as to show me your license, please? - They really picked me some partner. - We're taking some kid to the hospital, she's got appendicitis. - Come in. - Hi, you wanted to see me? (Caroline screaming) - Man, you crazy or what? - Fuck off. - You are crazy. (suspenseful music) - [Martine] Hey you, stop. - [Partner] What did I tell you? - [Martine] Stop. - [Partner] The mother fuckers. - [Martine] Stop, police. - [Partner] They're getting away. - [Martine] Damn it, stop, police. You're out of your mind. - Shit, I could have had them. You're getting... - How did it go? - No sweat, wrapped and delivered. - And the ambulance? - Down in the lake. - I'm driving back to Paris, do like I said, everything will work out and don't anybody touch her. Is that clear? - Absolutely clear. - [Mrs. Wenders] Good. - [Criminal] Hey careful, she saw the boss. - No man around? - No. - Good looking woman, it doesn't figure. - It all figures, when you know the answers brother. (spoon clinking) - You wanted to see me Captain? - [Captain] That's right, there's something I want to know. Did you really have to put on that lone cowboy act this morning? - No, I admit I didn't have to, sir. - So why'd you act solo on that tip? Then I'm gonna tell you why, because you've got a personal grudge against Mrs. Wenders, and what's more you think you're James Bond. The boss also wants to see you, your ass in grass. - I can turn in my badge right now sir, if you wanted, I'll leave it up to you. - Cut out the crap. Your assignment is to break up a ring of video tape porn. Now, Lieutenant Detective Valmont handles this kidnapping, you don't. - All right I get the picture. - I'm glad, now get out. (door slams) I think you poured down a little too hard. - On purpose, Valmont. You wanna bet she's heading to Mrs. Wenders just the same, if she wants to go after big boys, bully for her, she's in for a ball. But I want you in charge. (suspensive music) - What happened? - I goofed and that's about it. - But my tip was good wasn't it? - The best. - Then I guess you brought what you promised. - Not before I find the girl, unless you know where they took her. - Do I still turn you on? - You did, now you don't. - It's Mrs. Wender's son. - Hello there, welcome to the Cloister, what can I do for you? - You mind If I finish my breakfast? - How often does your mother come here? - Every night, without fail, to count the cash register. - And what do you around here? - I pick the acts. (upbeat Euro disco music) - You seem to like it. - [Martine] A girl named Caroline Burton was kidnapped from St. Mary's College this morning, and I'm pretty sure it was you. - Me? - [Martine] You did it. - [Mrs. Wenders] It happens I spent the whole morning in bed. - I hope someone can vouch for it. - I think you better get out. - [Martine] I wanna see your contracts you two. And you better have some. - [Mrs. Wenders] I don't know what you think you're doing. Do you have a warrant? - No, I act on hunches and let headquarters handle the paperwork. (tires squealing) (car doors thud) - [Martine] Let's take a short cut, go on. Come on, step on it. Hurry up, I said. Keep 'em apart, buddy. Here, would you mind taking a look at the strippers working at the Cloister? They're all minors. - That's some catch lady. You get a metal for this. What are you gonna do about it? - What we should have done a few years back, if she didn't enjoy some kind of protection. - I'd better warn you, if you wanna make a case out of it, it better be good. - What's eating him? You got the goods on her and he cuts into you. - Come on, bag a big wig and you rock the boat. - [Valmont] From now on you're under arrest. - [Partner] All right, I'll ask you to sign a hotel register, and you get a free room and board. - [Valmont] I'll put your personal belongings in an envelope. - [Partner] I guess you know your rights. You can call your lawyer. - [Valmont] Or your pals at the Ministry. - [Martine] Cut it out, will you? Here. - You better think again, no judge is going to sentence me for employing strippers who added a few years to their age. - You wanna bet? All right, do we begin with the first version we end up throwing into the waste basket? Or, do you start by telling me the truth? What's your alibi for the kidnapping? - I was in bed. - In bed, cute. You better give me her name, if you want me to believe that. - I slept alone, why as a whore, that's my pleasure. You get that? - Your son is a kind of a nut isn't he? - Not any more than you are. - Let's find out. Come over here you jerk, come on. - You mother fucker. - Yeah, like it didn't fall out of your pocket. - Oh, come on that's a cheap trip. Everybody in the room saw you drop it. - Did you see me drop it? Did you see me drop it? Did you, did you see it drop? - Come on, will you keep your lid on? - Before you knock his block off, let's get a picture of him for the files. - Good idea, let's go. - Get him out. - [Anthony] They should take you the hell out. - [Partner] Want to hurt yourself walking into a door, or what? - Bestiality, plus rape, plus gang bangs, plus kiddie porn. I've got a feeling there's plenty more where that came from. I'm getting a warrant to search your place. - There's nothing at the Cloister. You know damn well I don't touch that shit. - Maybe we do, maybe we don't. Maybe we don't want to know. She's one tough cookie. - In that league, they're all tough cookies, but they all have their weak points. You want some? - No. (door creaks) - It feels pretty weird. - So it does. - The good old days. When my joint was a second home for every cop on the vice squad. - You came a long way since then. - I paid my debts, bub. - What do you got there? - It's on account. - Do you know your room's exactly as your left it? I haven't touched a thing. Even your clothes are still there. I sit there a minute every night. (door squeaks) - The very glaive of the law. - Yeah, the worst there IS, a one man police force. - The way things look, I've got a problem. - That's right, you have. - Would you see what you can do for Anthony? - All right, I called the DA, he's playing along with us. The whore and the son stay with us for awhile. - No, the kid will have to be more useful to us outside. - You know what? Whether for the cassettes, or for the kidnapping, you've got nothing on us. - We're holding your mother a day or so. The next time you get some great idea into your head, you call me first, I'll save you some trouble. - Ain't that something, you got me there. - I got a weak spot for delinquents. It's a new trend around town. Get out of here. - Ciao, you break me up. (Anthony laughing) Ciao man. Ciao brothers. (door buzzer ringing) - [Valmont] Hi ya. - Oh, it's you, come in. - I'm not disturbing you? - No, I thought it was my kid sister. Oh, let me finish this, I'll be right back. There's a bit of whiskey left help yourself. - No, I've only got a minute. Watch out for Mrs. Wenders, she's dangerous. - Hang on, you're supposed to handle that case, aren't you? - I may find it a bit tough with blinders on. I was shoved off to the sticks a couple of years ago. Sadistic. - (in unison) Racist and brutal. - Ever since I do exactly as I'm told. - [Martine] All right, but who is handling the kidnapping case? - Theoretically, it's supposed to be the Captain, but he doesn't give a damn. He's rotten, and you better turn up some proof that she's kidnapped that kid. Otherwise the bitch is out by tomorrow. - Come on, I'm in the corner just like you are. What the boss says, goes for me too. - Well, maybe, that's for your kid sister. - Walter, hello? Walter! Now where the fuck did he go? I don't believe it. Walter! Whoa, where are you? - [Walter] This VCR here's the best there is for porn movies. - [Luigi] Walter! - Wanna see some more? This here wraps them up. - You dirty pig. - This is here puts on the stickers. - Oh. - You think you're smart telling her all that? - Come on, two days from now, she'll be 5,000 miles from here. Isn't that right? Take a look at that "Biggest Cock in Bangkok". This is "Double Penetration”. This one here, "Calling on Call Girls". It's great, all about lesbians. Maybe you like lesbians, huh? Huh, don't tell me you've never tried it. - No. - Cut the shit out, didn't you hear what the boss said? - Screw the boss. And now you get lost brother. I'm mean ain't 1? Huh, That's not true, I'm not mean, hmm? - No, no. - I'm not hurting you, am I? - No. - Come on. (telephone ringing) - Hello? - Get her ready, I want it wrapped and ready, I'll explain. - Yeah, all right. - [Walter] Relax. - [Caroling] Leave me alone. - Hey brother, Anthony is coming to pick her up. - That leaves us plenty of time, huh? Come on. - Hi ya, got any happening? - Yeah, the best there is. - Can I try it? - Come back in 10 minutes. - Who is she? - Nobody, all she wanted was a match. - It's me you're talking to Blake. I wanna tell you something. You listening to me? If anybody from that bunch of yours shows up, you tell me. - I'm gonna get into trouble, I can feel it. - Yeah, but you're my only link with Mrs. Wenders. - Yeah, you make it sound real easy. I'm hungry, and I'm dead broke and I can't live without drugs. Do you realize I'm risking my life every time, shit. - Do you think the girl they snatched isn't running any risk? Hang on, it's all I've got. Cut it out will you? - Well, now it looked like love from up here. - I wouldn't bet on it. You must have a heart like a... - Never goes that high. - That's so? Yeah, some cop you turned out to be. - Hey, hop in Blake. - Hey, you're out, the cops let you out. Take a look, in the back. - [Blake] You must be out of your fucking mind. - Shut your fucking mouth. Climb in and help me make a delivery. Get in. - Shit, I've got a delivery to make too. - Come in or you're dead. (eerie music) - [Auctioneer] And here comes a new lot, a brand new batch of fillies. Wait 'till you see boys, beauties all of them. Famous girls right from Piccadilly (indistinct). Let's have a round of applause, and now follow the gals. This way gents, take your pick. Did you ever lay eyes on such pretty broads? No sirree. You know what, they're artists in their trade. (indistinct chatter) by her tattoo. (indistinct chatter) who likes to be spanked, and slapped, and whipped, a ravaged, that's right you get me. - (claps) Music if you please. Sandra, Fabiana, Annabelle, Cathy, Julie, Inuchika. - [Buyer] I must say, they're all superb. - As a rule, all of our girls are young and quite healthy. - We hope, I was told your asking price was $50,000 cash, that right? That's a lot, too much. - [Trafficker] Every girl here stands to earn you between 40 and 50 thou' a month. It's the best investment you've ever made, bar none. - You're right. - Do you know this place? - Sure do, come on. I'm Mrs. Wenders' son. I'm bringing in Caroline. - Things have changed now, your mother is hot. - We made a deal and you'll stick to it. - Vamoose out of here while you still can. - [Radio Host] Police said today, no ransom had yet been asked for Caroline... - Let me get out. - [Radio Host] The girl who was kidnapped yesterday from St Mary's College under the very... - Please let me get out. - Shut up or I'll shut you up. (Caroline groans) Let her go, don't be an ass, let her go. - Let go of me, shit! You let the bitch get away. - Are you crazy or what? - Pay for this you bitch. - You're faced right out of your mind, and so am I. Any how, what the fuck do you wanna do with her? There's no deal. - What about my mother, did you think of that? - What do you say? - Yeah, she was in that house out in the country with them. - That about wraps it up. Boss looks a little pale around the gills I'd say. - The Burton girl says she found out Mrs. Wenders is neck deep in the porn cassette business, sir. - So, what do ya want? To cut a promotion? - Listen now, Captain. I think I know what you feel for this woman. The good old days I guess. - Go peddle your crap somewhere else. Please shut the door on your way out. - Well now, I guess you'd probably expect to get a raise. Is it the first time you've latched on to someone big. - Yes. - Good for you. You're handling two investigations simultaneously. - Clue me in. - Your first, and probably your last. (eerie music) - [Criminal] Scream and you'll wish you hadn't. Now, what did you do to Mrs. Wenders, and it wasn't very nice? You're in for some punishment girl, you see this? Hold her good. Hold it, don't move. Hold on to her for Christ's sake, that's it. You got some build for a pig. - [Martine] No. (Criminal whispers) - Oh, I'm sorry, Jerry Brown. I work in an office upstairs. (shotgun bangs) Ever since they stole my radio, I carry a gun when I come down here. - [Commissioner] The honorable Chang Lee family had to react to the Wenders' business, and two of their men are dead. - I had nothing to do with it. I'll never believe their men was shot by a nut named Jerry Brown. They'll be after your ass. And since I want you to stay alive, I'm switching you to a desk job, so you won't be a walking target, got it? I'm told you're good on a typewriter. - I want to be respected, and I intend to be. I'm a police detective and a good one. I don't want you to hide me behind some desk. - You're after too big a fish, Marty. The vice squad has been taken off the job anyway. - Who's got it then? - [Commissioner] The criminal squad. - What's the criminal squad got that we haven't? Maybe they're smarter than we are. Mind you, I think I'm pretty smart. - Yeah. (man cheering) - By the time we're through, they won't even recognize this town. - Cut it out. (men laughing) - Hey, what's that? Look at that. - [Masked Man] Where'd you get such a fancy hat? Hold it, where do you think you're going? (indistinct chatter) - Cut it out. (indistinct chatter) - Better start carrying one. - I leave guns to the cowboys. - [Dispatch] 01 to 413, a 705 (indistinct) Plaza. Passy side do you wanna to take it? - Yeah, I'll take it. All right girl, hold on to your shirt. (tires squealing) - You're gonna kill me. - Hey! Stop it, what the hells the matter with you? Stop it, I tell ya. - Leave him alone. (men groaning) - Stop, enough, are you crazy? - Come on, you mother fucking prick, come here. - Oh, yeah. - [Masked Man] That hurt, hey? (men groaning) Fuck yourself. - What's all this about? Watch it. - How do you like it? And now? - Stop it Val, stop it, you're gonna kill him. Val, stop it. - You're lucky she's a social worker. (gunshots banging) - [Martine] Bulls eye, congratulations, you killed him dead. (Martine claps) - Yeah, I used to be like you. No hate, no gun. 'Till the day an old buddy of mine got his right next to me. Here, this is a man who killed him. - In my humble opinion, bullets can't stop delinquency. - You think working off your sentence will? Instead of jail for a holdup, he ends up picking up papers in a park. And if you rob an old lady, you end up painting her apartment. Next thing you know, thugs are gonna be protected as if they were a disappearing breed. - You poor man, I hope your breed disappears. - Aggression is biological. It grabs us sooner or later. Here, it's a gift. - [Man] Detectives from the 3rd Precinct, are expected all the stand for 20 rounds. There's a, there's a call for Lieutenant Holloway. - Touch it. A gun makes you feel different doesn't it? - That's what worries me about it, here. - No, I want you to keep it. Listen to me, you may forget Mrs. Wenders but she won't forget you. The underworld is one of the few outfits that still works three shifts around the clock. - You're a pain in my ass. (gunshots banging) Excuse me a sec, will you? (gunshots banging) Hey, you working out? - Hi, may I introduce Maria, we were in school together a while back. I'd swear, it was only yesterday. - No, yesterday we were together in bed, ciao. Are you coming? - [Police Officer] See you. - [Martine] Yeah, I'll be seeing you. - Bye-bye. Is that your boyfriend? You're in love with him. You've got it bad. Come in 01. I've got a woman who just fell out of love, anyone want it? I'll take it. - Those chink hoods should stick to chopsticks. - If you're so smart, sonny, when are you going to get that broad, who put the jinx on your mother? - She's dead. - How about that? So you really want to score yourself a cop? I laid one out once, and you know what? His brother's been on my back ever since. Killing the broad won't help your mother one bit. And come to think of it, you said you hate your mother. - I'm making it a matter of principle. I wanna get her out of jail. I'll go see Chang Lee, he'll help. - I would like to help your mother, but I'm not too much enthused about it. I already lost two of my men, and this isn't even our fight. And the newspaper already put us in the light. The newspaper are putting spotlight on us. Our work, may suffer from it. - Mr. Chang Lee, you seem to forget that my mother helped you over the years. - [Chang Lee] Let us, a police captain. - She mainly helped a certain captain. Yeah, in exchange for which he stayed away from you. - We you cannot risk the whole organization for one woman. - I do not know your mother. She is said to be quite powerful. - What's that supposed to mean? She's in the coop. What's the good in power, when you're cooped up? And the cops have an eye on me. I want you to help me get her out. - [Gang Member] Only if you help us. - [Chang Lee] Oh, is that so? - [Gang Member] Yeah, maybe we use our bazooka, or we'll dig a tunnel. Or maybe we use battleship. - Let's hear the man, do you have a plan my son? - Sure. (soft piano music) - You're not bad at all. Let me show you what else I can do. Put your hands over my eyes. Well? - [Joelle] Can I share in the fun? - In case you don't know, you're supposed to knock. - What's the gun for? Oh, I get it. Another shy brown-haired man came into your room and raped you. - What do you mean? - Just what I wanted, a robot. I'm a bit old for it, but thanks just the same. Well, see you later. - Where are you going tonight? To a nightclub, the... (phone ringing) (upbeat Euro disco music) - What's the story? - The chink said okay. So it's on, where's Blake? She's probably phased out somewhere. She would've come in handy. - Who needs her, come on. - [Doorman] Hi, have you got your card? - Yeah, like several. - Will do. - That was neat. - Mother always said money gets you through all arches. - And she was right. - Man, ain't they pretty. - [Coat Girl] Would you like to leave your jackets or something? - Yeah, I'd make her. - How do we get her out of here? - Let's go. (upbeat Euro disco music) - Sorry, sorry. - She got kind of faint all of a sudden. - All she needs is a bit of air, she'll be all right. Come on, come on. - Let's go and step on it. - That's what I call nice tits. - Cut it out. (phone ringing) - [Anthony] Captain? - Yeah, Captain Reed. - You said to call next time I had a bright idea. We've got your female dick's kid sister. I've got a proposition you can refuse. I'm giving you 24 hours to set my mother free, or we'll kill her, you got it? (phone clicks off) - It's gotta be the chinks. (suspenseful music) - If you can't see where you're going I'll slit your eyes open for ya. - [Pickpocket] Hurry up, get his wallet, come on. - One of Pangolo's sons just tried to pick a fight back there. I want Pangolo told he wants trouble, he's gonna get it. - I'll see he gets the message. Mr. Chang Lee. - If Rennie is there, put him on. - I'm sorry, but there's no, Mr. Rennie here. - Yeah, there is. Tell him Marcus would like to speak with him, you got that? - Mr. Rennie, Mr. Rennie. Someone named Marcus is on the line. - Rennie. - There's a parcel that was picked up recently. They want to swap it. Do you anything about it? - Yes I do, the deal has my personal approval. (suspensive music) - Did they call back? - [Sarah] Sergeant Sarah Logan, I'm the new girl. - I'm asking if I got a call. - Yeah, from one of Chang Lee's men. Listen to me Martine, we agreed to make the swap. - You must be crazy. - It's set up for two hours from now. -I won't let you do it, you hear. I'm not about to give into a bunch of punks. - I'm thinking about your sister. - [Martine] That's just the reaction those cheap punks are expecting from you. No, no, no, let's think up something. - [Sarah] We've got no choice. Chang Lee's behind Anthony and he's pulling the strings now. He gave us two hours, and he means it. - [Commissioner] The deal we made, is at 15 minutes after Mrs. Wenders walks out of here, they drop off your kid sister, somewhere in Paris. - They said Mrs. Wenders shouldn't be followed. But me and my men will keep a discrete tail on her just the same. What do you think? - Huh, how much do you wanna bet, she'll get away and my sister ends up dead? - Listen Marty, I know how you feel, but you've gotta trust us. You're not on the case anymore. You got a desk job now. - You gotta be crazy if you expect me to lay low, I'll find them and ['ll bring them in for you. - How with a crystal ball? - I've got a snitch up my sleeve named Blake, and she'll lead me to them. - [Captain] We're not as dumb as you think, you know. Fact is Blake's disappeared, God knows where she is. (upbeat music) - [Martine] Hang on (indistinct) - [Criminal] Shit, the cops. - (in unison) Mother fuckers. - God damn bastards. (tires squealing) - Careful, there's a wall. Hey, where did you learn to drive? - Fucking pigs. - Stop right here, shit come on, don't drive in there, no. - Ah, get out of here, get out. Pig bastards! Get that pig van, get them. (indistinct chatter) - I don't believe this. Where are you going? - Get 'em this way. (indistinct chatter) - Quite a place they got. - Up there, you gotta knock three times. Say, "200" and hand over the bills that's all. - 200. What are you doing? (Martine groaning) Leave me alone. Bunch of freaks. - [Man] Hold it, baby, come on. - I came to get Blake. Black is what you're gonna get move. I said move, go. - You go to a whorehouse and you get fucked, and that's just what happened. (gunshot bangs) (man groans) (gunshot bangs) (man groans) - Over here. (gunshots bang) Drop them or you're dead. Gotta give them a fair warning, don't you? You still got its twin? - Yes. - But you forgot it at home. - Yes. - That's great. - Tell me, why don't you open up a slaughter house when you retire? - How the hell did you find us? I've got me a radar, state-of-the-art. - Yeah, you're a one-man weapon system. - [Dispatch] 329 to HQ, or the Bel Air squad. - All right, Mother, go back to the jungle. - [Martine] Cut it out, will you? With out him, damn it, I never would have found her. - [Valmont] You'd be in fine shape, if it weren't for the cavalry. - You're full of crap, and consider yourself lucky I'm a woman. Otherwise I punch your ass down the block. - [Dispatch] Lemaire to HQ, operation (indistinct) Scheduled to affect in 15 minutes. (inaudible) - Well, let's get a move on. They're freeing Wenders in an hour. - What, about me, man? Am I free? You mean I can split? - I wanna be there in an hour, let's see what this family sedan can do. Off we go. - Gee, I sure this swap comes off okay. - Aren't you happy with us? - So happy I want to puke. How about you? You come on big time, but you're strictly small time. - If you ask me you come on pretty strong yourself. - 'Cause I'm afraid, do you understand that? - You smiled at me last night at the club. - That's because I like the way you chew your gum. I meant to ask you, how much do you make? - Why, you want a percentage? - A million? No, I'd say no more than half a million a year. And that's the life you want to live? - I don't have any talent for living. My mother says I'm only smart enough to run a business. She may be right. What can you expect from a whore's son? Yeah, but it's all right. I'm happy to be alive. Do you have any friends? - Some, yeah speed-heads like me. But that was a long time ago. Now, they're straight, they even vote. That's never been my problem. Can you beat that? - [Joelle] What? - [Anthony] I'm losing against myself. For a woman, you're all right. - Hey there, what's with you? - I'm only reading your signals. - Wait. Please. Be gentle. You won't hurt me will you? - No, never. Do you believe me? - Yes, I believe you. You're too handsome to be a liar. - I know you want something, so what do you want. - While, you were having a ball. Luigi and Anthony, kidnapped my sister to trade her for Mrs. Wenders. You'll find a way to contact them, they'll need you sooner or later. As soon as you've located Joelle you phone me. - First I want you to give me what you promised. I'll do it, but never again. I want to live different. - All you have to do, If you want to live different is to kick some old habits of yours. - You shouldn't trust a stoolie, one day they're on your side, and the next day they're not. - You pay them for a tip, and you don't expect to make friends for life. Let her do her job. You keep doing it your way. I'm gonna sit by the phone and stop tailing me huh? - Listen, Martine, you're right girl. I can be rough sometimes, but I want you to know, Joelle is right in here. Mrs. Wenders is coming out in 15 minutes. We'll stick to her ass like glue. - Try to cool down okay? - Valmont, stop her. - I don't like the way you're acting with her. - Are you in love with her? Are you? Then stuff your feelings in inside pocket, or I'll take away your gun and give you a pea-shoot, and I mean it. - I'm not completely stupid. - Good boy, all cops are stupid. - [Radio Host] Police are unusually reticent about releasing information concerning the kidnapping of young Joelle Savignac. The most likely reason maybe that police authorities are considering or have decided to release Mrs. Wenders, recently arrested for illegally employing nightclub acts and suspicion of the abetting prostitution, in exchange for the young girl's freedom. - It's about time, we could have used you know. - Champ, I'm here. What am I supposed to do? You will drive a relay car, and wait on this corner right here, okay? - Okay. - Here's the registration card and the keys, it's parked on the street. - You know him? - [Luigi] You always meet your own death sooner or later. And this here is mine. Look at me. You wouldn't be high, would you? You look a bit weird. - Cut it out, I don't know what you're talking about. - What I'm talking about is I don't want you to louse things up for us. The cop's sister's right there huh? - Get the fuck out of here. - Take the suspect up to the store room, the DA is there. - I've seen some pretty far out things in this town, but this scheme is really something else. - Don't worry about a thing. This thing will remain strictly confidential. Until some reporters sticks his nose and blows the thing up on the front page. - No, we got this package under lock and key. - You're one hell of a tricky bastard, 'ey Captain? - Maybe I am, but gives me personality. - All right, in exactly. half an hour, we expect Joelle Savignac to phone us she's free. - I believe I already gave my word. - [Commissioner] So you did, and should you ever go back on it, it's your ass in a sling. - Well then goodbye. - [Commissioner] Alpha one to all cars, they're on their way out, proceed as instructed. - [Commissioner] Alpha four to alpha one, that's it, they're coming out through B exit, as anticipated. Captain is shaking the DA's hand, walks along side the W. - I did my very best, but your troubles aren't over yet. - You're very nice, the best Captain in the whole wide world. - Breathing in clean air may be bad for you. You've got 1/2 an hour to get her free, don't forget. - I better make a knot in my hanky. - Take it easy Valmont, all I have to do is make one phone call and you're out. - There's a booth right over in the corner. - [Commissioner] Alpha two to alpha one, WV is walking down Fontainebleau Avenue, In your direction. - This is alpha two reporting, WV is getting into a red Alpha Romeo, license plate number 690 FEG75. (tires squealing) - Happy to see ya boss. - So am I, Luigi. - You want me to call 'em to let her go? Here, that's the hide out. - Keep her there for a while 'till the heat's off. How do you like that? (Wenders laughs) Another thing they don't know, is that I ran the 4.40 when I was young. - Right turn on Young Street. (upbeat techno music) - It looks like they're splitting up. Stick to W, I'm calling in. Alpha two here, W is heading east down Canard Street. We're dropping the driver, over. (upbeat techno music) - [Commissioner] Alpha one to all cars, fan out however the following intersections, Names and Durante, Bagatelle and Charles. Valmont, keep your eyes peeled. (two-stroke motor revving) - Up yours, you haven't got me yet, you son of a bitch. (two-stroke motor revving) Learn to ride, you mother fucker. Come on, come on. Come and get me. What have you done? Here, have a drink, fuck you. (suspensive music) Ha! (men groaning) - You got a permit for this? - No buddy, but why don't you try to ram it up your ass? - Is this where you're keeping her? - Why don't you go fuck yourself? - I've got your picture too. - Go on, shoot, what are you waiting for? You want me to say I'm scared? Well, that's right. You win mother. (gunshots bang) - You see, it's no worse than having a tooth pulled. (gunshots bang) - Oh, are you out of your mind? - Where'd she go? - Search me. - What happened ma'am? - Well, some crazy woman almost run me over. - A brunette wearing blue jeans? - Look. - Shit, there's a back door, hurry up. - Hi there, long time no see. - Well done you screwed 'em good. - Cops today are stupid as bulls. They charge into anything that moves. There's a change in the program, we're keeping her. That's your route. - Okay. (suspenseful music) - Stop over there, I want to change. - There's some clothes down there. - Hi Jerry, is there anywhere I can change? - Yes, I was expecting you. Just follow me, come on. It's on the first floor. (car door thuds) I'd better leave you. - No you can stay, how's business? - Get outta here. - What are you doing? - I need the phone, scram. - [Jerry] That's a pretty bad scar. - The only good thing about being ugly, is that it lasts, good looks don't. - Here, I'd like to show you something. It's amazing the number of girls who dropped their fiances for another girl. - Normal. Look at the dictionary, the word after fiance is fiasco. (telephone rings) - Hello? - It's Blake, take the highway to west then Saint Germain, a small dirt road to Beyrouth. They're building some new town, she's in a cabin or some work site. - [Mrs. Wenders] And what's the word after treachery? - [Jerry] I don't know. - Let's say trajectory. (upbeat rock music) - [Commissioner] Alpha one, to alpha three and four, W driver terminated, back to precinct. All other units resume regular patrol. - I'll bet Valmont was here. - If he'd killed him, it would've been in good riddance. - What'd you say? (upbeat rock music) - So, how did it go? - It went fine. Where's the girl? - We're right here. - We'll take her back to Paris. - No, she's staying with us. - We made a deal, what happened? - I'm breaking it. Ask our friend there, whether she stuck to our deal. - What did she do? - [Mrs. Wenders] Blake turned us into the cops, didn't you? She sang on us like a canary. (gunshot bangs) (Blake moans) - [Joelle] It's horrible. - What did you do that for? - She was strictly for the birds. Get her into the cabin. - No, leave me alone. - Come on. - Leave me alone. - Scratch your eyes out if you let her. - Start the car Anthony, and make it fast. - No. No. - [Walter] Come on. - [Joelle] You said you'd let me go. - [Walter] Get in there. - [Joelle] No. - [Mrs. Wenders] Tie her up. - No. (Joelle yelling) - Are you gonna shut up? - [Mrs. Wenders] Let's get out of here, move. - Don't gag me please. - You'll soon be together with your sister. What's left to you. (suspenseful music) (gunshots whizzing) (Walter groans) Damn fool, take cover. And don't let her come any closer. You're in for a surprise. Don't you worry, Zorro's here, cover me. - What are you waiting for, a bullet? (gunshots bang) - Valmont? (gunshot bangs) (Joelle screams) (dynamite explodes) - Joelle, Joelle. - Where's Joelle? - Don't worry, she's all right, now move. - Where's Joelle? - She's all right. (Mrs. Wenders chuckles) - Joelle! (solemn music) - [Shop Owner] That's quite a pistol. - [Martine] A present, I'd like you to fit it to my grip. - Sure. Please follow me. Here you are. - Who bought it for you? - Valmont. - [Gunsmith] Yeah, poor bugger. I'd put some putty aside for him. There it is. Something was eating him, what I don't know. Here, squeeze this as hard as you can. I never could figure out what made him tick. - I did. - Hello Captain, you through for the day? - Yes I am Mrs. Long. (dog barking) (suspensive music) Come on out. - How'd you know? - Yeah, I lived alone 12 years. If you came to chat, chat. - We want Martine Savignac. - What the hell for? - She sent us up for eight months, and we'd like to thank her for it. - We want her. - You're biting off more than you can chew. (suspenseful music) - Ya, almost good enough. - I can still whittle off a few seconds. - You better, my girl. It looks like somebody after you. - Like who? - Oh, a couple of thugs. You never find this lettuce in the city. The whole town knows about it. They're real subtle. - They've got guns? - Oh, well there's this bulge. Ha, you just smiled. - No. - Hey, you don't want to hear this, but I'll say it just the same. You won't find peace unless you leave the country. Last week, you said, "I want to go very far away." You drove 200 miles, and you stopped. And Joelle and Valmont are still with you. You wanted to buy a house. You're alive, and that means living. - Yes, I know but... - There are no small victories. - Being alive is no victory. - [Instructor] Now add a dash of cinnamon and a drop of vanilla extract. Pour a tumbler of warm rum into the bowl of milk. - Is that you Mario? - [Instructor] Now you've got a punch nothing short of explosive with which you can flambe your souffle just before serving. (gunshots whizzing) (suspenseful music) (gunshot bangs) (man groans) (gunshots bang) (gun clicks) - Shit. - [Criminal] Ah, my eyes, you bitch. (man shouting) - [Mario] Martine, where are you? You had me scared. - Only one person knows I'm here, the Captain. - Hello, it's Bernard. She's coming up. - Thank you. (suspenseful music) So you're here. So, I hear you put them both away for the count, that's good. Look what they did to me. They kept on going over me 'till I told him where you were. McGee, where are you? Usually stays right here. Eh, don't mind the mess, come on. You look very... - Very rested. I feel good, where's Mrs. Wenders? - Ah, if only I knew. Everybody's looking for her. Chang Lee, everybody. - But you're not. - Me, I don't look for anybody anymore. - I went to your place, you've got a very nice family. Your wife said you're on a job. You weren't very hard to find. (Inspector coughs) Try these, they're better. I wanna find Mrs. Wenders, help me. - You listen to me, they put me in another precinct when Valmont died. I was out in the sticks for about five months. The truth of the matter is I've had it, okay? I'd like to take care of my wife and my daughter, and that's it. - Anthony Wenders? - Oh, he's been seen once or twice, at the Blue Video Studio, all right? - You looking for shit? - No. - For a good lay? - Fuck off. - What'd you did, that wasn't very nice. - Make it easy on yourself, kid get lost. - No sorry, you can't come in here, no, no. - [Director] Mean it, you think this is a tea party? - [Porn Star] Anthony, where I come from we don't use these words. - [Director] Can the humor and give me some hump. - [Porn Star] I'm humping. - [Director] All right, go. (woman moaning) Go, go. Go, go, go. When she starts wiggling is when you're supposed to slap her. Fine crew you turned out to be. - Brace yourself, here's where the fun starts. - Am I supposed to like it or what? - Cut, where do you come from? You like it. - What are you doing here? - Tell the director to come here please? - [Director] Sigh, wiggle, slap, smile, sigh. Okay, now try to get it right this time all right. - She wants to see you. - [Director] Hi ya, you're one of the new girls? Do you have a picture? - [Martine] How's that? Think before you run. Get over there. - That's what I call a surprise. You didn't change much, Sheriff. - That's what you think. So, you're gonna help me find your mother. - You want me to squeal on my mother? - You better boy, if you know what's good for you. - Nobody knows where she is. - The Captain might. - Try the Imperial Pagoda, it's in Chinatown. - That's really super, beautiful. - [Captain Reed] Hello, Imperial Pagoda? It's the Captain. Martine Savignac's coming, kill her. Good riddance. - You've changed, but I can't figure it. - Yeah, what's changed is that I'm retired now. - Good thing, isn't it? You won't be bothered by your conscience. - I left my conscience behind with my badge. (Captain and Wenders laugh) - Now what? - The Imperial Pagoda, do you know it? - Some kind of lottery run by the chinks. - There you are good luck, may the dice favor you, go on. Now everybody watch, gentleman lost too bad. All right, who's next? - Me. - [Croupier] Then come here. Don't be shy. You pay for them or you win them, there you are. Go on, roll them, go on that's it. - Who buys the bullets? - Some cop. - Another son of a bitch, who wants me to clean up his own mess for him. This shotgun, he's my brother. He never lets me down. (shotgun clicks) (prostitute gasps) - Tell me this one thing that, when you were with Joelle, what happened? - We talked a bit. - What about? - I don't recall. - Did you sleep with her? - [Anthony] Yes, we had a thing for each other. - That's funny, looks like it's closed. - [Prostitute] She's my sister, (women giggling) This Thompson submachine gun. See, she'd never let me down. - I'll bet it's a 1940 update. - [Prostitute] You want to bring down an elephant or what? - It looks prehistoric to me. - [Prostitute] No, historic is the word. - Shh. - [Prostitute] Everybody used it, Capone, ♪. Edgar Hoover. Where I come from, some people even use it today. (gunshots ringing) - What are you doing to me? Son of a bitch. (gunshots bang) (man groans) (prostitutes yelling) - [Martine] Talk to me, say something, anything. - At the Captain's place, did you see the room? - What room? - My mother told me there was this room for her. I don't know a kind, kind of museum with photographs. - No, I didn't see it. - That figures, she never set foot in that room. He stayed there waiting for her. That'll be the day. (indistinct chatter) - Come on, tell me about it. - How are you? - Okay. - You're young, I'm old, on my way out. I know there are questions you ask yourself, when talking to an old cop. You ambitious? - I'd like to be a good policeman, that's all. - Don't change your mind, you'll be all right. You were born poor, you'll die poor. No cop ever gets rich. On Sunday, he tends his garden, washes down his old jalopy. Pays his bills, like everybody else. It'd be dangerous for you, when you let yourself get deeply involved. That's all this old cop can tell you. I'm going home. - You didn't get it, did you? Your mother's holed up here with the Captain. Come on, call him, keep him from coming home. - What do I say? - Make up some kind of story. Get him as far away as possible. - Captain, a call for you. - I'm gone. - His name is Anthony, it's urgent. - He's coming. What do you plan to do with my mother? You really mean to kill her? - Hello, is that you Anthony? - That's right, it's me. Martine Savignac's gone back to your place, she left with mother. - Where to? - To some hotel, Novoline Square. - Which hotel? - The bitch's got a gun on me. Nothing I said is true, she wants to kill her. (gunshot bangs) (glass shatters) - Anthony! - Stop, you've got no life, come back. You bitch, come back here. Get the hell out. - [Pedestrian] You're out of your head. (tires squealing) Mother, mother, get out she's on her way over. - Darling, I was so worried. - Take me away, take me away, I'm afraid, take me afar. - [Martine] Stop. - Leave her alone, kill me, I'm sick. Kill me instead. (gunshot bangs) - [Mrs. Wenders] All right, I'll go with you. You win, I give up. (gunshot bangs) (Martine moans) Come back, you won. Take me in, I'm giving myself up. Don't be afraid, you won. (gunshot whizzes) Don't be afraid. You don't have to run. You don't have to hide. (gunshot rings) You look beat, you need some rest. Don't think about what just happened. Those bullets are in the past. Think about the next bullet. - You old bitch. - It takes all kinds to make a world. (Wenders laughs) My poor darling, my poor child. (gunshot bangs) (Mrs. Wenders sighs) (gun rattles) (car motor revving) - Mother. (somber music) (sirens wailing) (somber music) (gun thuds) Where are you going? - Out, elsewhere. - It's a place I've always dreamed about. (somber music continues)
