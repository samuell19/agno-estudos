(cattle lowing) (glass shattering) (whooshing) (crickets chirping) (waves crashing) (water spraying) (car engine revving) Gimme, uh, gimme, Gimme. Gimme, gimme, uh-- If you don't like it. You know where the door is at. Gimme, gimme the Elite. Yeah. The Elite? Yeah. Nah, gimme the Works. But you're gonna vacuum the car, right? I'm not gonna pay 12 bucks and not have the damn car vacuumed. Yeah. Yeah, what? We vacuum. Read the sign. Oh. Yeah, gimme the Works. 12 bucks for a lousy wash. Hey! Vacuum, right? (Jimmy scoffs) (slow jazz music) - [Jimmy] Man, it's colder than shit out here, Art. I mean, what's this all about, anyway? You ain't gonna catch nothin'. We could've met in a bar or something. Jimmy, I think I got a way for us to make a lot of money. (scoffs) Yeah, right. A lot of money. - [Jimmy] Uh huh. Hey don't laugh. 500 grand, each. Man, why don't you tell it to that fish out there, okay? Jimmy, I am serious. I'm through with that shit, Art, I told you. I got it all figured. I'm done, man. It's a sweet caper, it's a very sweet caper. It'll be me four of us, so musically speaking, it's a quartet. A what? This is enough, okay? Just, just listen-- I've done my time, Art. I'm through. Look, nobody gets hurt. I got the seed money saved. Man, this is ready to happen. Look at you man. Hey, you tell me you wanna work in that car wash the rest of your life. Jimmy, I want. I need somebody I can trust, man. I need you. Look, just hear me out all right. Hey dinner. Let me buy you dinner. You want me to buy you dinner? Come on, we'll talk. What'll be? Popeyes! Brown's Chicken! Screw it, we'll shoot the one. Kentucky Fried Chicken. (airplane soaring) (police car siren wailing) (bluesy jazz music) I think the cap makes it. I gotta guy who altered it. Michigan Avenue quality. That's a really spiffy suit. Very professional. But. What? Lots. Could you be specific? First, you guys are traveling damn near 400 miles back and forth. That's a lot of exposure. We're up there for hours before they even figure out what's going down. And it's only minutes from the border. By plane. Right! They won't be expecting that. I don't know Aurthur. And then there's your buddy. Jimmy. I remember him. What do you remember? Jimmy Fuqua. Point guard, little guy, quick hands. With Illinois, there was a couple of years when they were half way decent. '79, '80, somewhere along in there. Yeah? Yeah. He took 10 grand to shave points and he got caught. Big fucking Michigan game. Bulu bulu and he's bounced out of school. In and out of the joint every since. A drug thing-- Years ago. Whatever, that ain't the issue. What is? The issue is he sold out his teammates. His partners. I met Jimmy in the hole. I trust Jimmy Fuqua with my life! He's a fuck up! He was just a kid! I've been shot at by younger. Mike. We all have our price. I was set up. Sure, sure, right. Arthur, don't go and piss me off. Mike. The why is not the issue. What is, is they took your shield and your pension. Believe me, I appreciate the difficulty there must be in finding gainful employment with that kind of record. Especially in security related fields. Proceed, Mr. Bledsoe. (water splashing) (bluesy ambient music) That house up on Barry where I live. I know that phone was bugged. You picked the phone up, it'd crack and hiss and pop. That's why I couldn't sell my sketches. We got buried. It was Nixon, it was-- That's too easy Art. What's easy? That conspiracy shit. I mean, it's like believing in God, ain't it? You know when I was a kid, about 10 or 11, it was right after Dr. King was shot. Yeah, now who do you think ordered that? See the FBI was all over him. Relax man. You're right but that's not my point. Now the city sent them, I don't even know who they were man. These officials, white guys, into the neighborhoods, to try to calm things down. Now most of this was just people you know, standing up, getting shit off their chest. But these guys were very polite, you know. They would nod, take a few notes. Say things like, oh that's a very valid point. You know, same ole same ole. But one time, this cat came in, brother. Stood up, looks these white guys right in the eye and says, we want what you got. And that scared them Art. Scared the shit of 'em. I mean you could feel it man. It wasn't tension, it was like some prime evil force. And you know, you knew right then, that there was no way in hell these cats were gonna give up shit. (alarm buzzing) Right. - [Art] Okay, so they didn't have the mahogany desk but those are the white haired dudes, man. (alarm buzzing) The corporate structure, political structure. - [Jimmy] I know that but man, but that's not what I said, okay. Yeah? - [Jessica] It's me. What? For this? She'll be an asset man. She's quick. We need a female. That's not what she's here for man. Jimmy, will you just ease up? Hi. Hey, hey. Mmm. Mmm. You remember Jimmy Fuqua? Sure, hi. Hey. - [Art] Mike, how did you get up? Front door was open. Sorry. Yeah, Mike Quinn, Jessica Sutter. - [Jessica] Hi. And uh, Jimmy Fuqua, Mike Quinn. Yeah. Yeah, what? Hey look, we all come here with clean slates, right? Tabula rasa, all of us. If anybody's got a problem with that, get out now. (soft upbeat music) Okay now look, I haven't told you everything. Some stuff can wait. And I want it to stay that way. What is something happens to you Aurthur? Nothing's gonna happen to me, right Mike? (upbeat jazz music) The timing at the banks is critical. We gotta get 'em in and out. So that he can make the 10:15. - [Jessica] This train from Chicago, this can't be right. What? Well, it's six hours by car to this place in Michigan, right? Right. Okay, well it's almost nine by train. That's cause it stops everywhere. In Hammond, Gary, where I pick up Mike, Michigan City, Benton Harbor, everywhere. Mike and I will beat it back by hours. Okay, Arthur, you've done your homework. Pretty impressive stuff on paper. Of course, you realize the whole thing blows up if anyone part of a, what's his face, the uh, chauffer. Blackwell. Yeah, the chauffer. Blackwell. Yeah, geez, what are ya, deaf? All right, what I'm saying is, that is Blackwell is full of shit, it's lights out, party over. I'm sure he's right. Why? I don't know, my gut. Anything else? Go on, tell him Art. What? Well, we're both into the music. The music? Yeah, you know, jazz. Be-Bop & Beyond. It's a bonding kind of a thing, like they're in a club. Uh ha. Yeah. Look, it's not often you meet somebody who has both Agharta and Pangaea. Aren't those diseases? No, they're two Miles Davis albums. (Mike laughing) No, it's makes sense. Why don't you just listen to Art? Look. How many people have a Miles album? Not many right. And those that do, they're into the acoustic stuff. They hate the acid funk stuff. Those of us that like it are few and far between. Jimmy, you understand me on this? Guess it must be fate. Yeah, it's a club all right. (bluesy jazz music) - [Arthur] Jessie and I go to the house, first. We set it up, then we meet you guys at the airport. Then we all go back to the house together. - [Aurthur] Right. - [Mike] I don't don't understand why you spend $400 a night on a beach house. Wail till you see this place. Nobody's gonna bother us up there. And it's equal distance to the train station to the airport, it's perfect. - [Mike] Better have a jacuzzi for 400 bucks. Mike this is it. Look, if the deal goes belly up, at least we'll be going out in style, right? Okay, enough of this house talk. When do I get to meet Charlie Blackwell. Don't be so anxious. Why, you said he was cute. Tomorrow. He's um, he's a regular on Thursdays after work. I'm working so I'll be there too. Good, you'll get to watch. You know, I knew this wouldn't be difficult for you. No, it's fun. (Mike laughing) Just make sure you get that car phone number. I'll get it. Even if I have to-- Are we done? I mean once we get car phone number, then we go. Then we go. Why is it I get the feeling you just do not like me? I never said that. Well, you didn't have to say it. (traffic passing) You know, Art would give you the world and you treat him like shit. Look, you know what? You know nothing about it. Art and I have got an arrangement, that's that. I think it stinks. Well, Art Bledsoe is a grown up and he can make his own decisions. He's a kid, he's like an innocent little child. Not like you. Not like you? Well you see, we have something in common. (scoffs) Shit baby, we ain't got a damn thing in common. Jimmy. I think you're lying. Art won't mind. You been to jail baby? Yeah, I've been to jail. Not weeks, real time. I can handle it. This ain't no misdemeanor shit girl, this is the real deal. Jessica, tell me something. What? Why are you doing this? 'Cause I gotta get the hell out of here. Hey, this is perfect huh? Yeah, that looks like a suitcase, Art. Jimmy, we're heading up near the bar. You wanna get dropped somewhere? Nah man, I'll walk. I'll catch you around midnight. Right. Jessica. Yeah? Good luck. I'll see ya Jimmy. Hey Art man, you gotta minute? Gotta go Jimmy. (upbeat music) Hey Art? Yeah Charlie. One more for my new friend here, too. (upbeat music) I'm way ahead of ya. Art, I wanna introduce you to a very, very good friend of mine. Baby, what'd you say your name was again? Oh thanks a lot. (laughing) It's been a long day, baby. - [Jessica] Jessie. Jessica, that's right. I knew it was like a Janice or a Jezebel or something. Jezebel! Yeah, well you're betting a thousand there. Well this is my man Art. Gotta record collection even bigger than mine. Wow. No shit. Hmm. Right Art? Hey, no joke. What's this for man? On the house Charlie, enjoy. (upbeat jazz music) Thank you. (Charlie and Jessica laughing) (upbeat jazz music) Ew, I love this song. I'mma go dance. I'll be right back, um. I'm sorry, what'd you say your name was again champ? I deserve that, all right. Yeah. (upbeat jazz music) Art, we'll get that. Baby got some major back. Fine, very fine. Whew and titties too. Look at those things. Art man, you're suppose to be on my side, you know? Guy to guy? I am. (upbeat jazz music) Arthur, I really admire you, keeping your cool like this. My girlfriend up there, I would go through the fucking roof. She's getting her brains fucked out even-- Quinn man! Smack you through the goddamn roof. (laughs) I betcha she's taking it up the keister right about now. Quinn, would you shut the fuck up all right? Hey Fuqua, give it a rest. Shut the fuck up! Aurthur knows I'm just busting his-- Damn! (Mike laughing) We go way back, don't we Art? Yeah. 25 years. 1968. Right, 1968. Busted Art at the convention at Grant Park. Fucking hippies, yippies, yippy doo dahs everywhere. (Mike laughs) It wasn't the park. Yeah, it was. No it wasn't. Of course, it was. No Mike. Where the hell was it then? Monroe Street, in front of the Palmer House. No. Yeah. You sure? Mike, I'm surprised. Well, I busted somebody at Grant Park. 1968, my rookie year. Aurthur, who'd they end up nominating again? Humphrey. There she is. - [Mike] Well she looks happy. Got it. Man, it was just like you said. The number were in the black book. And I found this guy a shit load of cash. And Blackwell? Sleeping like a baby, hmm. (car engine humming) Can we get some breakfast now? Mike, can we have a minute? - [Mike] Sure. What? - [Art] You know. What? - [Art] Is that appropriate? What? Put your leg down. Bullshit, make me. Do it now. Art Bledsoe, are you jealous? Look, just 'cause you ball half the civilized world, doesn't mean you gotta advertise it. (sighs) Shh, relax baby. Come on, you know you're the only one for me. I just want-- Me. You're gonna be the best of me. Only old men worry about dying baby. And you guys can drive the van. It may not be my place Aurthur, but I'd smack the shit out of her. (slow jazz music) - [Jimmy] Having second thoughts? No. - [Jimmy] You okay man? Yeah, everything's cool. Cool. It's just ah, it's just hitting me, you know. Like, this is gonna go. - [Jimmy] Yes, it is. I'm thinking like, what could happen. What it really means Jimmy. Art thanks. For what? You didn't have to cut me in on this. Quinn, that's what everybody thinks right? - [Art] Jimmy, I never doubted you. Never you know. Yeah. - [Art] I know you're there man. Till the end. But still. Is that it? The shoes and the cap are inside. I'm there man. You can count on me mother fucker. My friend. (bluesy jazz music) - [Woman On PA] May I have your attention please? (faint talking over PA) Where's Charles? Charles is sick today ma'am. My name is Lewis. (Jill clears throat) (airplane soaring) (cars engines humming) Ma'am, I'm going to have to stop for some gas. (signal light chiming) Couldn't you have done that before? - [Jimmy] Sorry ma'am. (upbeat jazz music) What are. (murmuring) I want you to shut up. (rapid jazz music) Please don't hurt me, please, please! (woman yelling) Oh come on, move! (muffled talking) (rapid jazz music) (muffled yelling) (rapid jazz music) You're all right, you're all right. It's okay. We do not want to hurt you. (Jimmy grunting) I'm going to give you something to read. (rapid jazz music) Dad, I'm okay. (rapid jazz music) (gun bangs) He was gonna make me. What the fuck's wrong with you? - [Art] What was that? - [Mike] The blindfold came off Aurthur. The ballgame would have been over before it began. This ape shot the kid. Oh man. Oh Jesus. Well, that's it, there's no turning back now. Art, we gotta calla an ambulance or something. He's-- Jessie, the man's dead. Art. What? This is wrong man. Well exactly what do you propose, Jimmy? I don't know. Come on. (pensive jazz music) Lock it up. We don't have to love each other. The pay off is in 36 hours. If you're in, you're in. And you play by my rules. Now, what's it gonna be Mike? I'm fine. It's uh. Jimmy? I'm all right. I'll see you at the airport. (van engine revving) - [Mike] Well? For now. For now, then. (car engine revving) (police siren wailing) (cars honking) (faint chattering) (tape ripping) (phone ringing) Yeah? It's me. Mr. Luce? Yeah? You have a telephone call. Thanks Mariam. Yes? Mr. Luce? Yes. I'm calling about your daughter. Yes. 10 seconds. - [Jimmy] There's something I want you to listen to. - [Jill] Dad, I'm okay. For 10 million dollars, I'll be released, safe and unharmed. If you cooperate fully, they promise not to hurt me. Listen to the instructions and follow them to the letter. I love you dad. (shaky breathing) Do you understand? Yes. You will arrange to have one million dollars in small unmarked bills waiting for you at the following 10 banks. Loot branches only. I suggest you get a pencil and paper. (suspenseful jazz music) - [Art] Are you gonna talk to me or what? Jessie, what could I do? Jimmy's right Art, it was wrong to kill him. I didn't pull the trigger. Yeah, but you brought Quinn in. Take a look in the mirror. I don't see any saints around here, do you? Yeah, well you didn't have to kill him. Don't you think I know that? Damn, I liked Charlie. Oh yeah. (laughs) What do you mean? Art, I know you. You think you do. No, I do. You think you do. (plane soaring) That's close enough. Tomorrow morning. It's your call. All right. (faint talking) Any news yet? No. You laid it out for the pilot? Yeah, we're back in two days. In the morning, in Chicago. All right. In the evening Toronto. Right. Half now, half then. Good. (van engine puttering) (Jill murmuring) (Jill grunting) - [Jessica] All right. What I tell you Jimmy, huh? Hey Art, this is cool. (Jill murmuring) - [Jessica] (whistling) Told ya, as big as a church. - [Jimmy] Yeah, I could have spent my summer vacations here. Despite some obvious limitations, I think you're gonna find this quite comfortable. Look, we're not gonna terrorize you. Lock you in the closet for two weeks. We're not Satanist, we're not demented. This is about money. Look, you'll get fed three times a day. We'll get you magazines. All you have to do is stay in here, be quiet, be still, rest. You make it sound like some sort of retreat. That wouldn't be so bad, would it? This whole thing will be over in just a couple of days. - [Jimmy] Art, it's the news. (water trickling) (door closes) - [Reporter] The story this hour is the reported kidnapping of the daughter of one of Chicago's wealthiest families. Jill Luce, the 20-year-old daughter of financier Morgan Luc Junior, was abducted early this morning at O'Hare Airport. As Luce had just arrived from Tokyo where she has spent the last semester studying at the American University in Tokyo. The demands of the kidnappers are not known at this time. In a related story, the Luce's chauffer Charles Blackwell was found murdered this morning in a remote section of Busee Woods. Blackwell, aged 25, was scheduled to pick up Jill Luce at O'Hare. (door slams) (waves crashing) It's fitting huh? It's like the world ends right here. Or begins. Jimmy, about Blackwell- Hey. Nothing you can do my friend. Yeah. Where did this come from Art? What? This. This whole thing, man. Seriously? Yeah. It's weird man, it came to me in a dream. A dream? In a dream, I'm on a beach. Not like this, the Caribbean beach. Blue water everywhere. And I'm digging this tunnel with my hands. I stop because in the distance, I see somebody on a horse. They gallop over and it turns out it's a knight. You know, like King Aurthur? Complete with a mace, the whole thing. He gallops over and he doesn't say anything. So I say, you know. You must be hot in that suit. (Jimmy laughing) He flips up his visor thingy. And it's Joe Stalin. The Russian? Yeah, the dictator. Stalin says, where are all the peasants? And I say, there are no peasants here. Too bad, says Stalin. I ask why. And he says, because before you slaughter them, they could build this damn tunnel for you. Think about that. And he gallops away. So I think about it. And I turn around and behind me now is this huge brick wall. It goes on forever, even over the water. And there's music coming. It's Miles, he's playing Some Day My Prince Will Come. I run up to the wall and I put my ear against it. I listen and there's big party going on. There was no way I'd get to it. And the graffiti says, take. You are the chosen prince. Take it all. Signed J.S. Then I woke up. We're here because of that? The very next day, Charlie Blackwell comes into the bar. We talk. First, it's about the music. Then he tells me about this gig with Luce, the kid being away at school. He lays it out man. Everything, he tells me everything. In my head, the whole time, I got this picture of Joe Stalin on that stupid horse, saying take. You're the chosen prince, take it al. You dream much Jimmy? You gotta sleep to dream. (waves crashing) (jazz music) Arthur, do you ever not listen to that noise? (laughs) You know, we gotta work on you Mike. Seriously. (jazz music) Hey Mike. I'd do it again, if that's what you're asking. Yeah. (jazz music) We're playing for keeps Arthur. If the colored kid sees me, we're made. It's over. I was wondering, I-- Do I feel bad that I popped the kid? No. I didn't make the world. (jazz music) (door squeaks) Dinner. There are a thousand ways a woman can get undressed. Simple. Very simple. (Jill grunting) Art says to, keep the door open man. What? Nothing's going on. Please help me. I'm scared. (sobbing) Let me go. My father, they'll be a reward if you help me. Please. (sobbing) Why are you doing this? Is it just for the money? If he tries that shit again, scream. What if he does something to that girl? Have you thought about that? We're way behind going back Jimmy. You told me that nobody was gonna get hurt. Who do you think I am? I'm not God, man. Art, this ain't you man. All right Jimmy, look. I'm a lot closer to 50 than I am to 40, you know. I'm old man. What do I got? I tend a little bar, I forge a few documents. What kind of life is that? I need this Jimmy. I need it. And I'm not gonna let Quinn or anybody screw it up for me. (pensive jazz music) I'm watching you man. (pensive jazz music) Here. The tunnel, I figure you've got, 45 seconds to look for the wire. That ain't a hell of a lot of time. Maybe you have a minute. Don't count on it. 'Cause they're gonna be tailing him. Ready. Okay baby, you're just going for newspapers right? Magazines for the kid, stuff like that? Yeah, I know. Nothing else? Yes Art, I think I can handle that. (papers flopping) Shit. Here. Let me. No, I'm fine, thank you. I got it. Some pretty heavy reading here. Yeah. Well thank you uh. Thanks. Well. Hi again. Hi. That's a lot of newspaper. Yeah. There's a bookstore down town if you're just looking for stuff to read. No, um, just my family and I like to keep up with what's going on, current events and stuff. Y'all have friends up here? Yeah, no, hmm hmm. Hmm hmm. We're staying a friend's summer place. Oh yeah? Hmm hmm. Where? Um, by the lake. That's beautiful property up there. Yeah. Not many tourists this time of year, though. Hmm hmm, nope. Sort of like a family retreat. - [Cashier] That's be $6.39. Here. I got it. Look, there's really no need for you to um. No problem, lead on. So you're from Chicago, huh? I didn't say I was from Chicago. I know. It's just your van has Illinois plates. Most people up there from Illinois are from Chicago. Right. If they were Indiana plates, I'd say you were from Indianapolis. Yeah right. I guess that's why I'm a cop. I'm putting stuff like that together all the time. Oh good for you. Well thank you. No, the job's undone. Okay. (door slams) Thank you, you've been a great help. My name's Ray. Ray Higgs. Uh, Jessica. Uh, Jessie. Nice to meet ya, Jessie. Likewise, Ray. Yet again, thank you. Uh, excuse me, Jessie. Yeah. But uh. I couldn't help but notice you're not wearing a ring. I was just wondering if there's a boyfriend or not, I'm wondering if you'd like to go out. You mean on a date? Something funny about that? No, no, not funny, I-- Most people date in the big city. Well yeah, of course. But, just not with us hicks from the sticks. Well, Ray, look, I'm flattered really. It's just that you caught me by surprise, that's all. Well then? Um, I'd love to but we're leaving tomorrow. Really. Yeah? Really. Is something wrong Ray? Right is right. Well next time, I'd love to, seriously. Be good now. I'm telling you, he suspects something. Something. - [Art] You were flirting with him. I was not, this time, I was, no, I wasn't. Mike? Chicago copy is hitting on her. Some hick, I don't know. I'm telling you, Art I'm fucking scared man. You should have seen his eyes. He was fucking weird I'm telling you. You just freaked Jessie, because it was a cop, that's all. Yeah, Jimmy's right. It's a long day. Waiting is the hard part. We'll cool out, have an early dinner, get some sleep. Why don't you go upstairs. And take a bath, relax the muscles. Come on, it's all right. Have a drink, a couple of drinks. Yeah, I'm out of pot. (swanky jazz music) - [Jimmy] Yeah? Jimmy. (swanky jazz music) What do you want Jessica? (swanky jazz music) Why don't you like me Jimmy? Hmm? What did I ever do? Tell me Jimmy, what did I do? (swanky jazz music) I just want you to like me Jimmy. (swanky jazz music) I mean really like me. Jessie-- I like you. (Jessica murmuring) (lips smacking) What? You smell like scotch, huh? Yeah, I checked out the liquor cabinet. Come on. What? Come on. Jimmy what? Come on. Come on. No! Come on. (yells) Jimmy it's cold! Damn right, it's cold. Always think you're so fucking cool, don't you. Tell me something Jimmy, why are you doing this? That's a damn good question Jessica. (Jessica grunts) Shit. Jimmy, you're all wet. Your girlfriend. - [Art] What do you mean? She's wasted. No, no, just a couple of drinks. She's-- No, in my room wasted. What do you mean, what did you do? I did nothing. You would. Fuck you man. We need her man. Yeah, she'll be there. She'll come through. It's just this thing with the cop, threw her off. She's all right. You can't see it, can you? It's in your face and you can't see it Art. Number one, this animal just about fucked everything. Easy guys. All right, Jimmy Fuqua. Come on, right here, right now. Come on, mother fucker, right here. Mike, put the gun down! What's a matter, shit head? You ain't shit without that gun, right? You ain't got nothing. You are making this so easy. Nothing. What's a matter with you guys? Pay off is in 24 hours, less. We don't need this punk Aurthur. Wrong! No, no, you can't trust this mother fucker, that's what it is. Jimmy, shut up! Look Mike, you got the gun. You got the gun, but you shoot Jimmy, it's over. Now you think about that. Mike, Mike in 36 hours, we're in South America. We go our separate ways, 36 hours. Jimmy, let it go. Jimmy, for me, please let it go. For you Art. (Art sighing) (pensive jazz music) - [Art] Listen carefully. Your daughter's safety depends on this. I wanna talk to Jill. Have your driver let you off at the LaSalle and Van Buren elevator train stop. Take the train north to Washington. Get off, cross the street and go into the subway. You'll see a-- (subway trains whirring) W-K-2-S-W-B-D. B-A-J-M-3. Open that door. There'll be a long narrow car, follow it. (vehicles whirring) Watching you at all locations. At no time, make no attempt to communicate with anyone. If you deviate from these instructions in any way, you put your daughter in grave jeopardy. (subway trains whirring) Okay Mike, here we go. (pensive music) (intense jazz music) (subway trains whirring) (footsteps stomping) (train brakes squealing) (rhythmic drums banging) (intense jazz music) (glass breaks) (intense jazz music) (alarm buzzing) Um, my name is Dupont. I'm suppose to pick something up. (alarm buzzing) (door squeaks) Jimmy, uh. About last night, I-- No. I get it. All that matters now baby is today. (cars honking) - [Jessica] They'll be waiting for him at the banks. They won't know which one he's going to first. Right now, he's at Continental Trust. He's gotta stay in plain sight. (overlapping chattering) They're not warned, he couldn't leave the lobby. They're gonna pump him for information. Yeah, but Luce won't mess up now. Not after meeting Quinn. Most of those guys, those rich guys, I mean. They usually get what they want, don't they? - [Jimmy] Yeah. You bet your luck. (overlapping chattering) One million dollars. Art follows Luce to the second bank where Quinn picks him up. (cars honking) That's brilliant. I'm thinking that we're going to 10 banks and we're really just going to one or two. It's simple but that is brilliant. Art's a visionary. A genius maybe. In a fucked up kind of way. Now the feds gotta think that he's moving on. - [Jessica] To the third bank. (overlapping chattering) - [Jimmy] 30, 40 seconds of confusion and Luce on the fray. (overlapping chattering) That's gotta be a first. When are thieves ever not greedy? (pensive jazz music) (train bells chiming) (intense jazz music) (train whistles) (car engine humming) Well? What happened, how'd it go? Jimmy, we hit every note. Hmm, baby it was beautiful. It as smooth. See, if Mike approves, you know it was cool. Ew Jimmy, you should have seen that case. I just wanted to grab it and run like hell. Didn't you Mike? - [Jimmy] What about Luce? Hey, he did everything we told him to. Once we lost the wire, he was ours. I'm telling you, this thing ran like a Swiss clock, man. Yeah, but don't forge the money. You don't have that yet Art. Baby, the money, I do not forget. (Jessica laughs) (gun clip snapping) - [Mike] You leave soon. - [Jimmy] Yeah, I know. Make sure you bring back the money. Quinn, if you touch that girl. I just want you to know. Jimmy, you wanna know something? - [Jimmy] What's that? That Michigan game. I had money on you guys. (laughs) Is that right? You know, I've been hearing that same shit for 14 years. You and everybody in the city of Chicago had money on that game. Hey, I'm not liking what I'm seeing here. I'll ignore it this time. This will cheer you guys up. Rio de Janeiro via Toronto. First class. Hours, gentlemen, hours. (waves crashing) Hey Jimmy, you all right? (scoffs) Yeah. Yeah, I'm all right. It's been 15 minutes, baby. You ready? Let's rock and roll. Mr. Luce? Mr. Luce. Mr. Luce. I've done everything you people want. Where's Jill, I want to see my daughter. That's where we're going. (suspenseful music) Now I want you to follow me out. I thought you'd be gone by now. Jessie? You don't look so good. I mean, you look good but. You know. Ray. This is my Uncle Art. Sir. Art's just in from Chicago. We gotta get a move on now, Uncle Art, come on. Wait. Are you Morgan Luce? Both of you, come with me. Shit. I feel like I won the damn lottery. Look, maybe we can make a deal, Ray. Deal? Look, I'm in the driver seat here darling. I'm taking that bag and I'm gonna drive like hell. Figure to be in Canada by day break. And you are coming with me. I'll treat you real fine. Ray, what about the guy. What are we gonna do about Luce? We'll have to kill him. I mean I'll do it. But you know. Shit, uh. We'll dump the body. We're gonna go-- I can't do this. Look, I'll take care of that, too. No, I can't do this. Jessica, two million dollars don't just drop in your lap every day! No Ray! You're coming! And I'm gonna fuck you. I'm gonna fuck you. You got it? You asshole. Watch how easy this is, huh. (Jessica grunting) - [Jessica] No, ow. (grunting) Okay, 441. - [Morgan] What do you need? Down on your knees sir. Look, if it's the money, you can-- On your damn knees! Please. My God, no. Ray, don'! Shut up. (gun bangs) (Jessica crying) Don't cry over him darling. I'm sure he lived a real sweet life. Pretty little blonde girlfriends, lots of rich food. He did okay. Big house, nice car. You bastard! I know you like me. I can tell at the market. (Jessica grunting) Now, that's a shame. Drop it. Easy. Now. Jimmy, thank God. I thought you were gone. Now, let's talk this out. When he didn't cuff you, I knew he was after the money. - [Jessica] Jesus, he shot Luce right there. (laughs) Figure how this looks. Shut the fuck up. Who are they gonna believe? They're gonna believe you killed him. I'm an officer of the law. Who the hell are you? Shut up and let me think. I'll say you took my gun. Jimmy, what are we gonna do? I'm telling-- Shut up man! (men scuffling and grunting) (gun bangs) Fucking cop. Can you believe this shit? (crying) Luce didn't deserve this. Come on baby. Jessica! Come on. (labored breathing) Jessie. (Jessica sobbing) - [Art] What do you think Mike? About the pictures. Original. I'm sorry Mike. It's just a whole lot of money. (gun bangs) (loud knocking) Help! Somebody let me out! Let me out! (banging) (Jill grunting) (van engine puttering) Come here, come here. (Jessica sobbing) Hold on, wait a minute. Baby, something's wrong. - [Art] Both of you freeze. What's going on Art? - [Art] I'm taking it all Jimmy. - [Jessica] Art, this isn't right. We can't leave Jimmy. - [Art] You're not coming Jessica. Where's Luce? He's dead Art. It's finished. - [Art] No, it's not. Not if that bag is full of money. Now Jimmy, you take that gun. Take it out slowly. Take it out! And throw it as far as you can into the woods. Throw it. Now, slowly, bring me that bag. Bring it to me. That's far enough, put it down. Where's Quinn? - [Art] Dead too. Open the bag. Open it! Now back off. Back off! You have to kill us too, Art. I know that Jimmy. You can't do this man. Don't you begin to lecture me. Art no! (guns banging) (Jessica sobbing) Huh? What are you doing? Not me right? (gun bangs) (Jessica yells) (guns banging) Jimmy! Jimmy! (sobbing) Oh God. Shh. (Jessica sobbing and yelling) Shh. (Jessica yelling) Shh, all right. It's all right. I'm sorry baby. I'm sorry. (Jessica grunting) (suspenseful music) Jill. You okay? Jill, it's over. You bastard, if you're gonna kill me, just kill me. Wait. (Jill grunting) I said wait a minute, God damn it. Come on. The keys are in the van, now take it and get out. God. Your father. He's dead. Daddy. (sobs) How can you sleep? What? (pensive jazz music) (waves crashing) (pensive jazz music) It's too bad you're gonna miss that boat. Jimmy. Art. We can split this. We can share a ride, it's a 40 footer. No. Well, what do you want to do? I ought to waste your ass right here. Don't even think about it. Throw it away. You had this planned from the start, didn't you? From day one. - [Jimmy] You're a fucking piece of shit, Art, you know that. It's a shitty world, Jimmy. I learned that. Look, you think I was gonna put up with this bullshit for a lousy 500,000 grand? I trusted you. I know. Don't do it. You don't understand Jimmy. I got to. Don't do it. (gun bangs) (Jimmy grunting) Oh shit. (grunting) (Jimmy laughing) (waves crashing) (Jimmy gasping) (Jimmy heavily sighs) (waves crashing) (pensive jazz music)
