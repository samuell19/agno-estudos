Several decades ago I will never forget my grudge, Netero! Jed... Why won't we put an end to this already? Hyakki Juon... Rasetsu! Even if I die, On will live on! "On", you say? I shall put you to eternal rest together with On. With the power of my Nen. 100-Type Guanyin Bodhisattva! Ninety-Ninth Hand! Present How could this happen..! Who are they?! We need to contact the Hunters Association..! Help..! The time has come. The time for revenge. You who hold a grudge against the Hunters. Your anger, hatred, and grudge - towards those who locked you up here... Release... all of it. Shadow is going to rule over light. Here you go! I'll take one! Thank you! Sorry! Here you go! Thank you! Bye bye! It feels like it's been ages since we've been in a city! Since we've been in a jungle until now. There were so many strange lifeforms there! A city seems to have a lot of those as well, though. Hey there, lady! Isn't it rude to bump into someone and act like nothing happened? Please stop blaming her... Her skirt barely touched you... Whatcha saying?! You got some nerve to oppose me! If words alone aren't enough... I guess I gotta let my fist talk! You bastard..! Osu! Thank you very much! I don't know how to thank you enough... Please, take this... Out of question! I just did the obvious. Excuse me. Zushi! Gon-san! Killua-san! Long time, no see! Long time, no see'ssu! 'Ssu! Hello, Gon-kun, Killua-kun! You seem well. Wing-san! Biske! "Biske"? Wing gets a "-san", while I'm "Biske"?! No honorific?! Well, but... Didn't you tell us to call you "Biske"? You seem the same as always, Gon-kun! Same goes for you! As sloppy as always! Well...! Tuck your shirt in! It feels nostalgic... Yeah. It's nostalgic. The Heaven's Arena! To all the combat sports fans around the world, thank you for waiting! The festival of the world's strongest fighters, the Battle Olympia's curtains finally open here at the Heaven's Arena! Naturally, all the matches are broadcasted live all around the world - via television, radio and the Internet! Only the lucky people with limited edition tickets - are packed here in the assembly hall! Ah, how enviable! And amongst them, several celebrities are present - to view the world's strongest fighters with their own eyes! How unfortunate, it truly is unfortunate. It's come to my knowledge that your father has fallen ill. I, Garcia, truly wished to meet him. Unfortunate, unfortunate... - That's too bad. Pardon for having bothered you. Here, here! - As you know, the higher you get on the Heaven's Arena, the more influencial you're acknowledged as, and this Battle Olympia is a tournament of the Floor Masters - of floors 230 through 250! I see. So you didn't get to meet Ging yet. No, but I met Kaito instead. I was happy to get to introduce Killua, too! That's great! We'll meet up again once the Battle Olympia is over. And now, the participants enter the stage! Here they come. Here are all the participants! Zushi is so amazing! He even became a Floor Master! He never missed a day of training. They're really intense... That guy is Zushi's opponent? "Has crushed an innumerable amount of wrestlers, as well as referees"? It'll be fine! Zushi... ... is strong! I can't wait to see how much stronger he's gotten. Thank you for inviting us, Wing-san! You're welcome. I have invited one more surprise person. I thought I'd ask for Zushi's medical trainer to come. I ended up being late... When is Zushi's match gonna be? Apparently Gon and Killua are here too... I wanna show them my Nen already! Ouch! Man, that's dangerous! They should shut these properly. What're you gonna do if a kid trips over one? What should we do with him? We can't kill him. Roger. There's no way someone as foolish looking as this is a Hunter. Here they are! One of these 21 participants will become the strongest Floor Master! A man of legend has come to witness this historical day! The chairman of the Hunters Association, Netero! It's Netero-san! The old man is here too? Dear Floor Masters participating in the Battle Olympia... I am Netero, the chairman of the Hunters Association. - Oh, he didn't skip out! I didn't expect him to give a serious speech. It's a formal occasion, after all. ... but winning a fight and reaching the top is also the beginning of isolation. When the result of a fight is out... Excuse me for a second. Got it. ... and what you see in front of you is nothing but peace and tranquility. When you find yourself in such a situation, you'll wonder what you pursued that strength for. Did the things you did so far have any meaning? You may even have lost sight of everything. Anyway, just have fun. Is it over? That's our chairman alright! Right? Did you hear the chairman's words? Did they reach you? He told you to have fun and enjoy this very moment! And now, please enjoy the dance show by the official Battle Olympia mascots! It's a showtime! To celebrate our participants, the fairies have arrived tonight. The passionate flame hidden behind those glass eyes... Gon. Let's use this opportunity to go see the old man. Okay! "Have fun"... huh? You're strong, Rengoku. Let's reunite in Nirvana. Go. Shall we have some fun, then? Chairman! What did you end the greeting early for?! Don't tell me you didn't take a proper look beforehand - This is the elevator doorman. Er, there are kids here saying they want to meet you - - It's fine! Come on! - Hey, stop that! - Stop right there! - Let us pass! You can let them through! It's been ages since we've seen the old man. I wonder if we can steal the ball from him by now? You've gotten good! Here! Shall we have some tea in my room? I can't breathe... Do your best! Hey, Kurapika! Huh? Kurapika? Welcome~ What do you want? This year's participants are such poor quality, it's a disappointment. I'm bored. I'm not here to relieve your boredom. That's cold. What do you think? We could build a card house together... If that's all, I shall take my leave. Does your presence mean... Gon and the others are here, too? I don't know. I haven't been contacted. I always act on my own. You picking a fight? Can't we get started already? I'm itching to fight! That's you itching? We will begin the first match. Just how much sweat have the participants shed before stepping on this stage? Osu! What the heck are you? Ya hear me, bastard?! I'm done. No problems here, either. Machine Eater! It's a system that uses a generator in the tower - as the electric supply for all the floors. Shut off the surveillance of the elevators. I'll take care of the controls. Complete. It was seriously bad! Who would do that just because of an idea they got? You used the Risky Dice tons of times yourself, too! It's fine for me! - Is that so. Netero-san? What is it, old man? The first match: Zushi versus Candiru! Combat ranks: Super Heavy rank and Mosquito rank! Zushi is facing a tough battle right off the bat! Candiru's... Whoops?! What does this mean? This is not Candiru! Who on Earth appeared from under the mantle?! This is the Heaven's Arena? Not bad. Come on, did you die on me?! What an eyesore. What is this?! Report: There's gas! Is something wrong, Netero-san? This aura... Fifty-nine. Fifty-eight. Fifty-seven. No, that person is already... Fifty-three. By my own hand... Fifty-one. Fifty. You..! Onbasara! Netero-san! My, my. To get so distracted by reminiscing. I wonder if I'm losing my edge. We gotta help! Don't touch it! What the hell is this?! The contract and restriction with On. What's the meaning of this? What, what?! Kurapika won't pick up... We were too slow. S-stop right there! I have nothing to do with this! Hey, what's happening?! What did you do to the Floor Master?! Maybe that was too soon. Do you think this is unfair? No. Feel free to use weapons or anything else. No matter how unexpected... a real martial artist never runs from a fight! By taking her own life, this person sealed my Nen abilities. Does that mean you can't use your Nen?! What should we do... You shouldn't get involved in this. One wrong move and we're all dead. Why... Why didn't we notice her approaching us? That's right! Even if she used Zetsu, we should have noticed her with En! If you hide your presence with On, En becomes useless. What is this "On"?! On is a power different from Nen that feeds off of deep hatred. It was supposed to have been locked away in darkness a long ago... along with that man. So you're finally showing yourself? That's your limit? How weak. But... An elbow strike? I did enjoy myself a little. Ladies and gentlemen. Look at this. Zushi! That's the guy who beat him? How dare he do that to Zushi.. I won't forgive him! You won't forgive, huh... This is bad! Is that Gon? It's not here either. The security control room... should be on the 230th floor. They sure went all out. Someone broke a wall on the 50th floor. Capture them immediately. Did the old hatred cause you to be reborn with a different appearance? You are... Jed's... Can you see it? My dear Hunters. Don't move. All hostages' lives are tied to Netero's. I wonder if the boys are alright. No need to worry about those two. But... How could that happen to Netero... These people... What on Earth are they? Ouch... This is the 50th floor. It seems there's nobody here. Is it blocked during the Battle Olympia? Say, Gon... I wonder what that "On" is. What are those people? I won't forgive them. For doing that to Zushi and Netero-san, I won't forgive them! Yeah. What's going on?! This is Sugino reporting. More and more of the government troops' armored vehicles are assembling at the scene. The amount is immense. What could be happening at the Heaven's Arena? We're in the middle of investigating now, - Yes. This is... - so we can't answer. Yes, but we can't answer that inquiery... What in the world. Nothing makes sense. Geez... Why can't you just lend a hand... We were contacted by the mastermind! It's finally here... I'm putting him on. Long time no see, ladies and gentlemen of the Hunters Association. We are... the Shadow. We have captured Netero and taken control over the Heaven's Arena. At dawn... we're going to execute Netero together with the hostages. "Shadow"? I've never heard of it. Me neither. The Shadow. It used to be an operational underworld unit. They carried out missions that needed to be hidden from the public. However... to radically reduce its activity, chairman Netero eradicated it, and sealed not only all documents from the time, but also its very existence. The Shadow should be long gone already. What is your requirement? An official announcement... of the Black Record that the Association is hiding. Who on Earth are you? You have time to do the announcement until 5 o'clock. That's in ten hours. I will stay here until then. Together with Netero. Yes? - Yes. - Isn't that the private line... - Yes. Yes. - ...for high executives? - This is the first time I've seen it ring. - That's... Yes, understood. Excuse me for leaving at the time of emergency, but something came up that I must attend. You're really a handful... What are these guys? Seriously? Looks like we have no choice but to fight. We are aware. Of the hidden history of darkness of the Hunters Association, smeared in blood. Hey, let me go! What is this?! H-help me! I'll give you all the money you want! Go ahead and beg for help. From the chairman of the Hunters Association, that is. I see. She has the ability to attack anything that comes in touch with me in this state. She's dead, yet I'm still controlled and moved around by her On. What a pitiful thing. That brand is... the Kanan concentration camp's..! That's right. She's a descendant of the Shadow. She got sent to a concentration camp by the Hunters Association. There shouldn't be anybody knowing about it anymore. I... gave out the instructions... to process it all behind closed doors... by Hunters who have that ability... That only covers a fragment of what happened. There were countless countries that ordered to make the Shadow a top secret. The evidence is stored in the Black Record. Are you planning to reveal that to the whole world? What the hell does this mean?! Wasn't the Black Record sealed away completely? The mastermind knew about its existence. Perhaps he's some sort of descendant of Jed who was the leader of the Shadow. We need to find out who he is or we're in trouble. If the Black Record is announced, it'll affect national interest! It'll affect our entire nation! - There's a possibility - for a new world war to break out! What the hell is the Association doing?! Hey, what are you going to do about this?! Excuse me. Yes? I see. Yes. Understood. There is no data about the man behind this. There's no information about Jed having any blood relatives. If that's the case... If that's the case, who the hell is he? Those were a pain in the ass! We're finally at the 200th floor. Just a bit more. Seems like they're gone. Yeah. This place is... Using weapons is allowed from the 200th floor onwards. You never know when the weapon you're holding will break. It seems to be self-locked. If all goes well, this'll open it- Alright! That's so like you... There's so much stuff in here! Killua! I found something good! Ta-da! Why would they be selling that?! Maybe it's because I used one in a match before? Yep, feels good! That's so nostalgic! Who are these people? Seems like they're all trying to get here. However... you won't be able to reach this place. Gas? It feels like we're being lead on. We're locked in! Gon, it's poison gas! I'm fine with this much, but... I can win! I can win... I can win! I can win, I can win! Is he saying something? I feel it... I feel it..! They're fast! You dodged... You dodged my attack..! I can't win..? I can't win! What's his problem?! Isn't this..! I'm going to be the strongest Floor Master! What are these people?! There's some people fighting, you say? Hey. I remember once seeing the martial arts you used on this kid. Are you perhaps... a descendant of the Shadow? That's right. How surprising that a young girl like you knows about the Shadow's existence. She isn't as young as she - The descendants of the Shadow... Didn't you hide in a village built deep in the mountains? Indeed. We lead a peaceful life there. But the nation... Garcia didn't accept our existence, he roused us into rebellion through absolute persecution, and under the name of justice, executed a plan to annihilate the suppressed Shadow. He set us up completely... And under the law, he used Hunters to toss us into a concentration camp. Countless of my comrades were forced to work like slaves, and they died a miserable death in poor living conditions. We are carrying out a revenge... with this power of On that person awakened in us. Seems like the Association hasn't settled things yet. No... Seems like I was wrong. Damn, we got caught! What is this aura? This is "On"! Hyakki Juon... Rasetsu! Wh... What is that monster..! I knew it..! It's true after all. I thought you were an incarnation of his old grudge, but... Your hatred that remained in this world was so deep you were unable to ascend to heaven, and the hatred that had no place to go to, revived not only your soul but your body as well. I never imagined I'd meet you again in such a form. Jed! Something seems to be happening. Seems like something dropped down. There's a thick smoke, I can't see a thing. Who are you?! Is it the terrorists?! Dancing Doll! What on Earth is happening here? That was refreshing. Er... What are you people trying to do? I'm done, Shura. Good job. But you over-did it a little. These small fries barely count as a warming up. So, what's up with those guys you mentioned? They seem rather belligerent. Hey hey, show me too. Hey! You're hopeless. I'll put them on. These guys are damn persistent! I'm strong... I'm strong... Oh, geez! What's the hell's wrong with this guy?! Can I kill him? No! That person is Zushi's battle opponent! Then what am I supposed to do?! Go easy on him! But make him unable to fight anymore! Huh?! What a pain in the ass! Shouldn't that be easy for you? - Don't be stupid! You don't know before you try! What is it, Gaki? Shura! Let me fight those two! Do I have to? Yeah. You have to! Don't go at them seriously! But at this rate, they're gonna get us! It stayed shut until now... This is obviously a trap. Just what we needed! That's more like it! I'm strong... I'm strong..! I'm strong..? The vain existence of people engulfed by On. You sold your soul to the devil. Just keep running your mouth, dog of that filthy association! Number four of the ten Hunter Commandments: "Hunters shall not target other Hunters". Yo! Yet you massacred my comrades in front of my eyes. Who are you? I won't let you go further! Let's have a Battle Olympia ring-side battle! An Emitter, aren't you? There is a condition to that law: "Unless they commit heinous crimes", that is. That's nothing but the Association's chicanery! You're good... You're good..! This is how it's gotta be! After joining the Shadow and seeing numerous Hells on this Earth, I was convinced. Hunters are evil! They flatter you by calling you a great man to satisfy your desires. On is the power of revenge of the oppressed! Finally... we meet. Whoops! You're on a whole different level than those guys we've fought so far! Yeah! Not that I have any intention to lose to you. We're gonna hurry to the top and save Netero-san and the others! You two are pretty interesting! I guess. Tell me. Why are you doing this? There's no way for you to understand. The depth of our grudge. Don't kill him. We were ordered to take them alive. They noticed us! Hey! Some brats are escaping! You brats may have the ability to do that... To bring Jed back to this world. O wind! Listen to us, desert smeared in blood! We hate this world! We reproach it! We want power! Show yourself to us! I swear lifelong loyalty to your highness and to take revenge on all Hunters. I swear. I swear. I have accepted your grudge loud and clear. I'll grant you power. Death to the Hunters. We made a contract with On to complete our revenge. I'd never lose to Hunters! Is that so! I don't give a crap, but your attacks have been pretty monotonic here! So have yours! Don't group us together! Damn! Gon! Hey! Where are you aiming?! You're pretty good! That was close... Gon! Above you! You can do it if you try, can't you?! Did he control that? Is he a Transmuter instead of an Emitter? The fact that he could take a punch like that... he can become an Enhancer, too?! I don't get it at all! Why's the elevator's wire not here? Seems like you can keep on managing the security system while fighting. You're a Manipulator who can operate the Heaven's Arena's system at will. In other words, to reset it while it's under your control, I have no choice but to take your life. You're wrong assuming that your shallow Nen - works the same way as the profound power of my On. This is the first time I hear about "On", but I have come to realise one fact while fighting you. Oh? That form of martial arts... You're a descendant of the Shadow, aren't you? I know about the Shadow's fate. It's a tragical story. Is it the reason you're causing this riot? I don't need your pity! Shape Shifter. I see, you are... from the Kurta clan, aren't you? Shape Shifter not only formulates the body, it also analyses the target person. This strength... Enhancement? You're not a Manipulator? Didn't I tell you? On is not the same as Nen. Aura types don't exist in the world of On. For those who serve On, it's possible to draw out all the types. I see. So that's the case. Holy Chain. Oh? The wind feels nice... What? Hi~ Hisoka! Hey, let me go! Are you sure? No, stop! Don't let go! It was so noisy inside that I came out here, but... you're even noisier. - What the hell! What do you want from me?! Three cards are stronger than one pair... but four cards are stronger than three. So what are you talking about? When you have all the cards, the game gets tenfolds more fun. Shall we go? - What? I'm done playing games with you! What a waste. This place is so dark, confined and empty. I'd have wanted to finish him off in the spotlights, in front of a cheering audience. What?! Killua! Whoa, Gon! It looked like you were actually struggling! A little. How did you move it? This elevator... seems to have a linear motor. It moves with electromagnetism. Gon! Shit! Whoa! He's still up there. We're even at hand-to-hand combat... but when it comes to speed, I win! See ya. Impossible! Why can't I move? First comes rock..! Rock! Paper! When did he..! Rock! Those children have really grown, too. We did it! Yeah! Wh... why..? How..? How did you stop me from moving? That linear elevator - uses a mechanism of electromagnets on the rails on the walls, and a permanent magnet on the cab to move. So... All I did was move the permanent magnet. Welding it was a piece of cake. Shit... When did you have the time to..? While you were all caught up just fighting Gon. It feels more like a battle to fight one to one. Are you Battle Olympia participants? Huh? No. Our friend is participating. His name is Zushi. He's that chestnut head guy that you beat the shit out of. Is that so. He packed a pretty good punch... though he still needs to grow. If he trains hard, that guy's gonna be strong. Well, you're not half bad at combat yourself, geezer. Yeah! You should have participated in the Battle Olympia instead of doing this! You could have faired pretty well. What's wrong?! Get away from me... This is the restriction set for my On! But..! Gon! His restriction was to self-destruct if he loses to a Hunter... Why? How come?! Hey. I don't understand. Letting their friend make such a restriction... He was their friend..! So why..! I won't forgive them! The power of On that makes them do things like this to get strong... It's wrong! Hear me, Gaki! My brother whom I gave my blood to! I won't let your death be in vain. I won't let it! It disappeared. Did you go ahead, Gaki? I have finally been left all alone. Why do you fight? As the survivor of the Kurta clan and an avenger just like me, isn't your anger the source of your life? The anger and hatred towards those who took your brethren's lives - is right there in your scarlet eyes. You're the same as us! Wrong! Killing you would be a waste. Wouldn't you join us? And become a fellow On user. I refuse. Is that so? In that case... Die! Kurapika! Hey! Get a hold of yourself! What the hell is that? It's On. "On"? He is.. possessed by wanting revenge on his comrades. Revenge... That's right. Just like me. Cut that crap... Don't say such bullshit! You're not the same at all! Listen. If it seems like you're about to lose yourself to your grudge... you have me, and Gon, and Killua - to punch you right on the face and snap you out of it! Can you hear me?! Get a hold of yourself! If you're already losing yourself, I'll do it right now..! I'd never fall low enough to need to be punched by you. I have... gained new comrades. I will fight for those comrades now. Oh? Looks like we can still play some more. This is bad! Is this all there is to your "On"?! It hurts! This much damage despite guarding myself with Ten, what the hell is that power?! He was more fragile than I expected. Master... Jed... What's this? Looks bad for one's body. You can't use Nen anymore. What did you say?! Wha... What did you do? Be honored. It's Master Jed's blood. You'll be able to awaken your On with it. Are you alright?! With On's power, you can live and fight for revenge only. I refuse! Kurapika! What I fight for is... Do as you please. However... if you don't do a contract with On... there's only death waiting for you. Master Jed! I have fulfilled my loyalty to you. Now I only wish for... complete revenge through your hand! Kurapika! Come on, get a hold of yourself! Kurapika! - What an unsatisfactory climax. I guess you get about 65 points. Shura. Your death... your grudge... will add to my strength. Let's dispel all the regret! You gave those people your blood - and made them captivated by On. That's right. They made a contract by acquiring my blood, and gained the power of On that surpasses Nen. Why didn't you use that blood on me, then? To acquire power, I set a certain condition. Netero. You're the only one my blood won't work on. So that I could use my abilities at their maximum - once I meet you whom I resent more than anybody else. It's the proof that along with defeating you, I was resolved to put you through danger. Have you completely lost yourself to On? Say what you want. I will let you keep your sanity until the end. I want you to witness with your own eyes... the downfall of the Hunters Association that you've created! Kurapika! Hi~ Hisoka? What about me?! What happened to Kurapika?! Seems like he was struck with the blood of this Jed person. It's not very clear, but seems like he can't use Nen anymore. If he doesn't make a contract with this power called "On" he's going to die. No way! Don't worry. I'd rather die than make a contract with On. You can't die, Kurapika! Then there's no choice but to make the contract... He can't do that either! Kurapika, hang in there! Never mind me... You need to help everyone. I will save everyone. But I'll also save you! Because you're my friend! Seems like you have no choice but to defeat that Jed person. You have all the right cards. But you don't have the means to defeat the final opponent. Keep in mind that to win the game, you need a trump card. What do you mean? No matter how strong the opponent is... No matter what means I need to use... I'll definitely defeat Jed! Wait for me, Kurapika. I'll definitely save you. Stay here to take care of Kurapika, Leorio! Sure! Killua! Yeah. Let's go! I'm counting on you. Gon! Kurapika's heartbeat... But... I can't leave Neon's side... Hey, hey! Come look at this! Seems like we could prevent any civils from getting hurt. Just when I thought I could take things easy! Now I'm worn out. The incident hasn't been solved yet. Well, those kids should fair just fine. Probably. Well then, we should start evacuating the visitors. Ehh... Zushi, we're going! Osu! The impact is incredible. This place is definitely too dangerous. I'm going to kick your ass! My friend's life is on the line! Oh? Your friend? But unfortunately... that friend of yours is a Hunter, right? I will make sure all Nen users will be gone from this world without a trace, and On will prevail. I won't let you! I'm out of charge... I'll go first! Rock! Paper! Paper! Killua! I'm fine! Rock! Paper! - Stop it! Rock! Gon! It won't even touch him. There's no way to beat him with an Emission type attack. But if you get his blood on you, it's the end! First comes rock! I told you to stop! Rock! Paper! Scissors! He's strong! How are we supposed to beat him?! Gon! If I don't beat you, Kurapika's going to die! Not necessarily. All he needs to do is make a contract with On. I won't let that happen! Then... I'll make a contract with On and defeat you! Oh? Don't be ridiculous! Jed, I'll be your opponent! I'll fight you to death! Are you okay, Killua? Gon... That was a good strike. Idiot! Why?! I'm glad... You seem to be unharmed. Killua! Rock..! I can't use Nen... At this rate... Killua... Kurapika... and Netero-san, they will all die... He's strong. Overwhelmingly strong. But! I have to beat him! He hurt my friends. I will definitely... defeat you myself! If it comes down to this..! What? I'll use On! I'm making a contract! A contract and a restriction! Don't do it... Gon... Stop it! I'll definitely protect my friends! Well done! Experience the same physical superiority as I do. How does it feel? Having your body overflow with power. On is your anger turned into strength. He's strong... But that's the power of On... At this rate, Gon will... You have become one of us now. I'd never become one of you! Rock! Paper! Rock! If you won't become my comrade, I will devour you and return it all into my power. Even with On, he still can't win? Is there nothing I can do?! "Listen, Killua." "You're the only one who can use Nen." Old man... You're going to die at this rate. You'd better make a further contract with On now. Turn your anger and grudge into strength. Should I try killing your friends? At any rate, we will massacre all Hunters who won't join us. You can't kick the bucket in a place like this! Gon and Killua are doing their best! Don't you dare die on your friends! Killua! Listen... I fought your friend. He was plenty strong even without using On. I... I don't want my friends to gain strength through On! Please... put an end to this already. Let's see, now. 100-Type Guanyin Bodhisattva! Gon... What did you do? The 100-Type Guanyin Bodhisattva holds the power of affection to counter On. Which one prevails is up to your strength. Snap out of it, Gon! The only one who can fight Gon now is he himself! Now, shall we settle this for good? It's been a long time since I last fought you here. Hyakki Juon... Rasetsu. I won't let you succumb in the darkness! You said that you pursued the power of On - to dispel the regrets of the weak. That's correct. But observing your actions earlier confirmed it. All you're doing is hunt and collect other people's grudges. No matter what you do, you're a Hunter just like me! You're wrong! What made you descend to On might have been me! You and me are the opposite sides of a coin. We were the same and merely took different paths. Even if that's the case, those paths will never cross again! That's exactly why I regret not stopping you back then, despite having been your friend. Not having been able to save you is my sin. I'll keep fighting you until you're riddened of the grudge, and the anger, hatred, and grudge - of the perished members of the Shadow that you carry on! Nonsense! Come back, Gon! We... are friends, right?! What? This is... Gon... I'm back, Killua. Your opponent is me, Jed. Say what? I'll be the one to... I'll be the one to..! Bastard! Stop running your mouth! Hyakki Juon: Rasetsu! Rock! Paper! Rock! I don't understand. Being willing to bring your friends down with you to carry out revenge. But, although I can't put it into words well... The frustration for being unable to do anything to help others... I don't agree with your ways, and it still hurts, but... I understand your sadness now. We will make sure that that sadness - won't ever be repeated all over again. So don't worry about the future, and take a good rest now. This can't be... What surpasses On's power is the heart of compassion - which forgives all creation in this world. We both were caught in the past after all. But the young ones have the power to build a new future. Have I lost? To a brat like this... But, Netero... I will never... never regret things turning out this way... Our score still hasn't been settled... This time, I will... I'll let it pass to call today's result a tie. But one day we'll settle the score. Sure. Until then... Bottom, huh? I'll be the backside of the Hunters Association, in charge of the Shadow's part. I'll leave the front to you. Are you really fine with that? I am... for now. But, one day... May you enter Nirvana where no opposing sides exist, with your heart in peace. Hey! Kurapika! I'm so happy you're safe! It's all thanks to you. I'm grateful. No need to, we'd do anything for friends! Hey, hey! Aren't I getting ignored here? Huh? What did you even do this time around? Well, let's see... I heard it loud and clear. You encouraging me while I was poisoned by On. Although your lines were rather cheesy. No, uh, that was... That aside! How did you defeat that Jed guy? Well... You didn't do a contract with On, did you? - What?! But I was called back by Killua! Thank you, Killua! You did something so absurd again... You're really a handful... Going that far for friends... For a second I thought I'd really die! Will Gon's contract last? Jed's death is also the death of On. His heart has been purified so there's no need to worry anymore. The darkness is gone. To all the combat sports fans around the world... no, around the whole universe! Thank you for waiting! Here at the Heaven's Arena, 251 floors above the ground - at the height of 991 metres, the palace of proud martial artists, the world's strongest martial artists are about to... It's kind of amazing... how everyone's acting like nothing happened yesterday. So... How were things solved in the end? So it was locked away in darkness again? Seems like it. That's not very reassuring... It'll be fine. We'll change things so there won't ever again be a Hunter controlled by On! That's the spirit! That hurt!
