NETFLIX PRESENTS How cool! -Gotcha! -Nora, come here. Nora! Nora, keep still! Hello, Sara. Hello. -Have you met my daughter Nora? -Hello. -And my husband Mikel. -Hi, Mikel. Nice to meet you. Well, come in. Make yourselves at home. Thanks. Sweetie, help me, grab that suitcase over there. I think I told you on the phone. The nurse only works for six hours. -And why's that? -It's all the insurance would cover. So we're going to have to take it in turns caring for her. -When do you start at the hospital? -Tomorrow. Doesn't anyone come to clean? Mum got rid of everyone, she couldn't stand any of them. Don't be scared. Hello. I'm Anna. I changed her catheter. Your sister said you're a nurse. Yes. She has ulcers in her kidneys and on her back. -You know what to do, right? -Yes, of course. Very good. Well, I'll be back tomorrow. Thanks, Anna. Are you going to die like Daddy? That's what you'd like, right? You little pig. She should be in a hospital, this place isn't suitable. She explicitly asked not to be moved from here. It's a living will, so we can't... There's nothing we can do. The notary made himself extremely clear on the matter. We'll have to move these books from here. When Mum wakes up, she'll want to find everything just as she left it. Victoria isn't going to wake up, Sara. Where are her things? -No, not that wardrobe. -The key? I don't know where the key is. Mum kept it safe. Her things are in that wardrobe. -Mummy. -What is it? When can I see grandma? -Grandma is very sick, darling. -I don't mind. You could have visited, even if it was just once, in all this time. I promised myself I'd never come back. I'm here for you. Certainly not for her. You called me and I came, to help you. And because I found a job, or I wouldn't have been able to come. Thank you. Nora will be fine at school, you'll see. -Where do you live? -I've rented a cottage. It's small, but... it's got a lovely garden. And... -Have you met anyone in all this time? -No. And Félix? Félix? Félix left a long time ago. He's married with three kids. Anyway, Mum didn't like Félix at all. Victoria didn't like anyone. How long has she been like that? In a coma, one month, ever since I called you. Shut away in that room, three years. The last few months were horrible. She just talked about death. She cried and moaned all the time... and rang that damned bell like a madwoman. Until one day, she suddenly stopped shouting. I went up to her room, I thought she was dead. You know? That tooth stopped hurting me as soon as she went into a coma. But, even still, I feel as though... she's watching me. She's watching me from the corners, like when we were little. -Will you be long? -No, I'm coming. Nora, are you there? Nora. Get back upstairs. -Daddy, I found this. -What is it? I don't know. -Can I keep it? -I guess. Ask your mother, go on. Have a good day. Kids, I've got a surprise for you. Let me introduce your new classmate: Nora Fernández. She's just arrived here. I hope you'll all help her with anything she needs. You can sit there, next to Beatriz. She'll help you. Right, Bea? Very good. Now, take out your maths books. I marked your exams yesterday and half of them were terrible. Hello, Victoria. My name's Mikel, I'm your son-in-law. I've seen what you're storing in that room. They already told me you're a scumbag witch. And it turns out it's true. Fuck me! Hello? -Hello. -Hello. -I'm Mikel, Alicia's husband. -I'm Anna, the nurse. -Nice to meet you. -I thought no one was here. Well, I was... -With the mistress? -Yes. Yes, and... she opened an eye. That's normal, it's a nervous tic. -I'm going up. -Yes, of course. -I have to go out. -Very well. -Excuse me. -Yes? Is there an electrician in the village? Of course, Mr Cotarelo. He's got a shop in the centre. That doesn't look like it's going to work. -Do you want to bet? -Go on then, a beer. Let's go higher. Two. You'll love this. Three, two, one... I'm suddenly feeling really thirsty? Aren't you? -Have you changed her nappy? -Whose? I didn't know I had to do that. -Of course not, man. -You're hilarious. Have you seen what's in there? Come on. Come on. We should throw all this crap out. I don't know what to say, I'd sell it on the Internet. I'm sure some nutcase would pay a fortune for all this. I love you. Darling, I've been looking for work and... it's not going to be easy to find something in my field. I even left a CV at the school, but I don't think they need electricians. So, I was thinking... perhaps at the port or working on a boat, I don't know. Are you listening to me? Are you alright? Yes. What's that? Fuck! Are you sure that woman is your mother? Coinciding with the arrival of your sister and... following your mother's precise instructions, I've invited your uncle Pedro Álvarez and his son Fran... Nora, go to your room. ...for the advance reading of Mrs Álvarez's will. Don't you think she should be in a hospital? This is clearly not the best place. No. According to the medical reports. But in this case, and until clinical death has been confirmed, we must abide by the express wishes of your mother concerning the treatment and care of her person. I have to open the shop, could you hurry up, please? How old is your daughter? She's ten, almost eleven. Why do you ask? Your daughter, Nora Fernández, will be the universal heir of all your mother's assets. As is usual in these cases, until she reaches the age of majority, you will be responsible for the administration of her assets. All of which, from meeting her, having observed the single act... There must be some mistake. I don't understand. No, it can't be... Good day. What do you want, grandma? Why did you call me? This room... just for me? Of course I'd like it. What are you doing here? Darling, I know you really want to be with your grandma, but you have to wait a while. You have to let her rest, so she can get better, OK? Come on, let's go. -Why is Uncle Fran missing a finger? -Uncle Fran is missing a finger? I didn't notice, he must have had an accident. But... She never even met her. She never even showed any interest in the girl... Calm down, Sara. Darling, darling, is everything alright? Yes, everything's fine. We'll be outside. Perhaps it's her way of reconciling with Alicia. She should have tried that before. And in a different way. We all know what Vicky was like. Your father's death deeply affected her. And then... she became obsessed with those things. She was very lonely. But I refuse to believe she was evil and the will is proof of that. How can you say that? How can you be so hypocritical? You knew everything. You knew about everything she did to us and you never did anything. You allowed all that madness. Don't talk about your mother like that. She has her reasons to say that. We all do. Ask your son. Shut up! Don't involve your cousin in this. He can speak, he has a mouth. Why don't you ask him? Why don't you speak? Why don't you tell your father what Victoria did to you? Speak! I understand you're going through a rough patch financially. If the last will of your mother can help you out, you should be grateful to her. Don't you think? What? And me? Sara, Sara! Sorry. Is it still hurting you? I got a call from the port, they need people to unload fish. Are you sure that's what you want to do? The stink of fish isn't great, but what can I do? I can't stay here all day doing nothing. I'm climbing the walls. -And we need the money. -That's true. Things are changing, my love. Bit by bit, but they're changing. Although one thing never changes, do you know what it is? You. You're still as hot as you were the day I met you. Yeah? No, more. Good night, grandma. Me too. Here it goes! Let's go, guys. Oh, God! Give it here. Have you seen the new girl? What a show-off. She's stupid, she should never have come to this school. You only have to look at her face to see how stupid she is. What are you doing here alone? I saw what you did the other day... to the cars. I see you don't have any friends. Of course I do. I have to go. My name's Luna. I came to make you a soup, it's always a nice dinner. I'm sorry about yesterday. Now that you're back, the last thing I want is to argue. It wasn't a good idea to come here. Listen. I'm sorry about all this, but I need you. I can't carry on alone. And you're my sister. I've got no one else, Al. So, I don't care if you want to keep the house. You can keep it all, I don't mind. But, please, please, don't go. Please, help me. Mummy! Mummy! Help me! Nora! Nora! Nora, open the door! The key! There is no key. Mummy! Mummy! Step back! Nora! Find something to use as a lever! Nora! Mummy! Run! Nora! Nora, move away from the door! Leave me alone! Nora! Nora! Nora, are you OK? Nora! Nora, look at me! Nora. Nora. Mummy. What happened here? She's asleep. We'll let her rest. What's that? It was Mum's. What's Nora doing with this crap? Al... You need to keep a close eye on the girl. Perhaps... I don't know, but... perhaps Mum wants her to stand in front of the mirror. What mirror? Al, the mirror... Sara, that's enough. I left to get away from all that crap. Do you understand? Alicia. Alicia. We can't pretend that nothing happened. Don't you remember that night? That night Fran slept over... and she took us to that place. It was the first time. She told us something. She wanted us to understand the meaning of death. Look closely, the spider will eat its prey. The disgusting insect will cease to exist. That's death. But I'm not going to let anyone devour me... not until I decide. And that will never happen. This is all just an illusion, like death. Do you understand? Open your eyes. Open your eyes! No! Look at yourselves! You were there too, with Fran and I. Sometimes we blank out memories so we can survive. It's normal. Where are you going? Alicia. What are you doing? Alicia. What are you going to do? Stop a moment, please. I won't let her hurt my daughter. Don't move! Sara, Sara! -Not like that. -It's for the best. Not like that. That's a crime. -Sara, Sara. -No, no, no, no. -It's a crime. -It's for the best! Listen to me! -Sara... -What's going on? No, no, no, Mum... -Mikel! -How does it work? -Mikel! -How does it work? I want to leave. I'm not sure about doing this. No. Bloody hell! Yes? Hello? What are you doing here, Nora? Are you alright? Doesn't this work? I'll get some candles. Let's go up to bed, yeah? It's very late. Come on. You've got no shoes on. I think I've lost something. What thing? Something I found. If you don't tell me what it is... We'll talk tomorrow. Promise me that you won't go in grandma's room again. Ever. I love you. What were you burning? Loads of old junk. Grandma's things? Things that aren't useful for anything. Come on, sleep time. Good night. Little pig. Little pig. Do you know what happened in the village yesterday? There was a power outage, right? Remember the electrician I mentioned? Mr. Cotarelo. He electrocuted himself working on the electrics at the school. It caused the power outage. Damn it, poor man. You burnt everything, didn't you? Yes. It's much better without all that junk. Yeah, I think so too. Alright, I've finished here. Hello? -Hello, I'm calling from the school. -Is Nora alright? No, the children have gone on an excursion today. -I want to talk to Mikel Fernández. -That's me. When do you start? Well, straight away, today. It's very urgent... they're using a generator to light the school. It's just a couple of days and it pays well. -Did you hear me? -Yes, I'm listening. Have you already told the hospital you're leaving? -No, not yet. -Well, wait a while. As soon as I finish the job, we'll go. I promise. I can't say no. And we need the money. Yes, yes, I agree. It's fine. -I love you. -I love you too. -Thanks. See you later. -Thank you. Bye, Pablo. Open your mouth. Thanks for returning it to me. Where did you find it? I lost it. Somewhere. Put it on, your grandma wants you to wear it. You know her? Grandmas always want the best for us. Sara. Mikel isn't here? No, the school asked him to fix the lighting. And Nora? Nora's sleeping. What's wrong? It's Mum. This may seem a little weird, but... Look at the medallion she was wearing. I think she used it to control us. And now she's using it with Nora, I bet. We have to get rid of the locket. She keeps it in the drawer. It's not here. Victoria doesn't know how to die. She wants to stay. Forgive me. Yes, I've been selfish. She's never going to forgive us. She's not going to forgive us. No matter how much you insist, you're already dead. Guys! It was you. Leave me alone. She's a foul-smelling, conceited swine. Just like her father. Have you seen him? He smells like fish. You're disgusting, just like that crazy old bat you live with. What are you looking at? I'd much rather be like her than be like you. Loser. Freaky bitch. Who do you think you are? I'm know they were making fun of her and her grandmother. But I wasn't expecting behaviour like that. I don't understand. We're very sorry. It's just... Nora isn't like that. She's not like that. That's what I thought, but we have to expel her for a few days. What's up, sweetie? I'm bored. Yeah, but that's part of the punishment. -Can I go out to the garden? -No. OK. Nora. Just the garden, alright? Nora. Nora. What are you doing here? Has something happened at home? How did you get in? The back door was open. You're very careless, Sara. Are you one of Nora's friends? You were always very naive. -What? -You heard me, idiot. -Nora, who's that? -That's Luna, my friend. We know where the locket you're looking for is. Where? Buried in your garden. It's you. Right, Mum? If I were you, I'd get a shovel and start digging. Alright, sweetie, you've hidden really well. I give up. Come out, this isn't funny anymore. You have to pay for what you did, you and your sister. I'd suggest you carry on, for your own good. Sara! Nora's escaped, we can't find her! Call as soon as you get this, please. Nora! Nora! Are you looking for this, aunt? Why are you doing this to me? Why? Nora, help me! She's still moving, hit her harder! Coward! What clothes was she wearing? -Her blue school tracksuit. -Tracksuit... -Green T-shirt. -Blue tracksuit and a green T-shirt. OK, thanks. Thank you. They'll find her. You're ready to complete the link. Come closer. You just have to look into her eyes. I'm scared. It's too late for that now. No one loves you anymore, Nora. Not even your parents. What will they think when they find out you killed your aunty? Is there any sense in life for you anymore? Nora, what are you doing here? I'm wiping up sand. We looked for you everywhere. Where were you? I was watching the waves. My love. My love. Hi, this is Sara. Leave a message after the beep. Thanks. Sara! Nora's escaped, we can't find her! Call as soon as you get this, please. I found this. It has phone numbers written down. Maybe someone knows something. Go! No, she closed the store. Nora, what did you do to that dog? Nothing. Nora, I saw you! He was destroying the plants. There's nothing else here. We should go to the police station. I'll come with you. Yes, are you coming? Let's go. Anna, come here a moment, please. Yes? You don't need to stay today. I'm not going to the hospital, I'll care for my mother. OK. Perfect. I'll come back tomorrow then. Very well. -Bye. -Bye. What happened to the nurse? She couldn't stay, she said she had a personal issue. I have to buy some gear, I haven't finished at the school yet. I'll stay. I'll call the hospital, it won't be a problem. Are you sure? What's wrong? Hurry up or you'll be late. And you, behave yourself. Come on, sweetie. Nora! What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be in class? It's boring, Mummy. Miss Mejido is unbearable. Why didn't you disconnect her before? Do I have to do everything? I don't need this disgusting sack of bones anymore. What are you doing? Give me my daughter back! -Mummy... -Give me my daughter back! Mummy, no! Mummy, no! You never loved me, little pig. What have you done to Nora? If you say a word of this to dad, I'll kill him. Hello. Daddy! Hello, my love. Careful with dad, he's very tired. Have you had dinner? Let's eat. Pass me the salt. Thank you. I never told you how grandpa died. Alicia, darling... It's important. We hadn't seen dad for a long time. He'd been travelling. Sara and I wanted to play with him, for him to notice us. Sara, where's your sister? We got his attention, so he'd come down to the basement. I hid under the stairs... to give him... a surprise. And... And he fell. Victoria always blamed us, but we were only playing. Liar! Nora. -Do you think it's normal... -You don't understand. What? Tell me, what? I'm going to work. Pack our stuff, as soon as I finish at the school, we'll leave. That's what you wanted, right? You've got what you wanted. For fuck's sake! I can still feel the warmth of his hands. The most attractive man I've ever seen in my life. Alicia looks a bit like him. She has his eyes. But not his heart. Will you kill her? I'd rather let her suffer. And him? Maybe. That way she'll suffer even more. Lose everything. Everything except her darling daughter. Who she'll have to look at, knowing that it's no longer her... but the thing she hates and despises the most... Ah! Bloody hell! Mikel, come home if you hear this. Mikel, please! Nora? Alicia? Alicia? Alicia! Nora! Nora, where's Mum? Nora! Where's Mum? Alicia? Don't move from there, sweetie. Alicia? Alicia! Gotcha! Sorry, daddy. It was Mum's fault. Nora! Nora! Nora! Nora! Nora! Nora, look at me! Let her go! You want more? The best is yet to come. Come here, pig! No, Mikel! Don't kill her! Don't kill her! No! No, Mikel, no. Don't kill her. Don't kill her, no. No, no, no! You won't see Nora again in your whole goddamn life. You're going to rot here. You're not going to destroy any more lives. My love. You have to hold on, do you hear me? You have to get better. I have to be what I want to be, grandma. You have to go with grandpa. He's a good man. He says that heaven is like walking on soft sand. You'll be happy there. And you can come to see me whenever you want. Like he has. You can protect me, grandma. Goodbye, grandma. Nora, darling. Alicia! Daddy, mummy. What? I love you lots. Talk to me, talk to me! I missed you so much. MISSING Grandmas always want the best for us. Translation: Lindsay Moxham
