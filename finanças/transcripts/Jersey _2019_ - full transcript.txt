Hello. - Hi. How are you? - I'm good. Do they have it? - No. Do you have any more copies of Jersey? I just sold the last copy. I'm sorry. Okay, we'll come back later. What? This is your fault. I wanted to make a pre-order but you said no. Now look what happened. Even if we order it online, we'll get it after two days. I've been waiting for it for so long. The world won't end if you don't read that book. Hello. - Stop grumbling. Excuse me. Hi. I guess you are looking for this book. Did we ask for this? What were you doing? Stalking us? Just wait. He's my dad. I'll be more than happy if you read about him. Here. Have a good day. Congratulations. Your book is a huge success here. And everything is sold out. 'Thanks. And every news channel is covering it.' 'Also, BCCI will call you.' - BCCI? 'Yeah, I want to tell you the good news before they call.' 'They are arranging for Arjun's felicitation ceremony' 'in Hyderabad this Saturday.' 'All of you must come.' We'll definitely come. Thank you. Thanks a lot. 'Okay, then. I'll see you soon here.' Yeah. Bye. - 'Bye.' Is he really your father? '2 triple centuries.' '7 double centuries.' '36 100s.' '78 50s.' 'Best batsman of his time. My dad. Arjun.' 'Sarah. Mom.' - Arjun! 'Always crazy about my dad.' I love you! Dad. Dad. Oh God! Don't start it early in the morning. I need to get to my 8 o' clock shift. Please let me sleep in peace at least for an hour... Nani, please don't make noise. Dad! Do you remember what this Friday is? Friday. - I didn't mean that, dad. The date. - July 10th. It's my Nani's birthday too. Dad! Even though I've more runs to my credit Coach made Vishal the captain of our school team. Really? - Yes, dad. He has Indian jersey. The whole team supports him. He wears it for every match and shows it off. Dad, are you listening? I'll definitely become captain if I have that t-shirt. Dad! Nani! Concentrate on the game. Forget who's wearing what and play the game well. Captain is not the best player of the team. He's the one who leads the team to play well. Your Coach knows who can do that job well. Got it? Go. It's time for practice. Hurry up. You need to finish practice and get to school. We need to stop at the sports store on the way and get a birthday gift. Will you really buy a jersey? If you keep your hand on my head and say it it's like a promise. I crossed my fingers too. You can't break the promise now. Nice shot! Come on, Nandu! He plays well, doesn't he? My boyfriend. Come on, Nandu! Superb! One more four! Hey! Stop shouting! If you shout one more time I won't let you enter the ground from tomorrow. Who is he to stop me? He should be a watchman, not a coach. Your boyfriend's body balance is not even. He is tilting more to his right. He'll get out with a leg spin. Come on! You can do it! Leg spinner? You jinxed it. You said it and the exact same thing happened there. It's over. We won't be going to a movie today. He'll be in a very bad mood. Come. There's no balance in your stance. If you tilt more to you right you will definitely get out with a leg spin. Who's telling you all this? I know. Let's go. Hello, champion! How are you? - Sir! I know I haven't done anything worth mentioning but every time you call me champion it makes me feel that I did something great. There's no doubt about it. You were the most stylish batsman in our cricket club. You were supposed to be in the Indian Team... Stop it, sir. If anyone hears you they will beat us up. Why would they beat us up? You scored 1 triple century and 3 double centuries in 1st class cricket. 28 centuries, 65 half centuries... Okay, let's go. How is your wife? She's good. She's a good woman. This is where you fell in love. Hello, sir. Did you bring everything? - Yes, sir. The watchman has the keys. Ask him to keep the goods in the storeroom. Okay, sir. New Zealand and India tour is coming up. Before the One Day International with India there's a charity match with Hyderabad Club. I'm making arrangements for that. You hit 5 sixes in Air India match, right? Why do you always come back to this topic? No matter how many places we go to we've to come back home. This is the same. But I vacated that home 10 years ago, sir. You didn't vacate it, Arjun. You ran away. Listen to me. The club still needs an Assistant Coach. You can happily do what you are good at doing. I quit cricket 10 years ago. It didn't happen then. I don't want to work as an Assistant Coach in the same place. Think about it. I know you. You are a very different Arjun on the ground. The last time I saw you with a brave face you were on a 66 foot pitch with a 3 foot bat. You came too late. If you had come before, then your work would have been done. No doubt. Definitely. Congratulations, you are selected. Thank you. Thank you so much, sir. Thank you, sir. - Yes! All the best. - Thank you so much. Congratulations. I told you. Only money can get you in. Everything totally changed overnight. It was in the papers that you were selected but they are claiming that it was a printing mistake. Nobody has a conscience. Hey! Have you lost your mind? You weren't selected just like last time. Does that need such a strong reaction? What happened to you? God! My boy! It's not so easy to get a spot in Indian Team. You'll have to deal with many more obstacles. I'm 26 years old, sir. I have a family now. I've a government job offer on hand. Maybe this is my limit. I don't want to waste another year. What should I do if the same thing happens next year too? Then try again the year after that. You don't say when you quit. Please let me be, sir. Arjun! Arjun! Arjun! Why do you stop here every day? You are smiling in those photos, dad. You look good. So are we really going to the sports shop now? Go inside and check out the bats. I'll buy your gift. Okay dad! - What's up, Arjun? How is Nani's practice going on? Are you coming back from the ground? Indian jersey... - Yes, I have original jerseys. Limited edition. They are on sale. How much is it? - 500 rupees. Nani's birthday is coming up in two days. It's for him. I'm a little low on money now. If you give it to me now, I will pay by the end of the month. Look, Arjun. I pay 10,000 rupees a month as rent. 5,000 rupees for bank loan. Then the workers' salaries and maintenance comes up to 20,000 rupees. Put yourself in my place and see. Can you do it? You are a good player, Arjun. I respect you. Because of that respect I can only no to you. Dad, did you get the jersey? Nani, your size is not in stock right now. It will arrive in two days. Dad will bring it for you. This poster is your birthday gift from me. Thank you. - God bless you, son. Thanks. Let's go. Here you go. You come here. Why do I have to remind you every day to pray? Come on. Nani, hurry up. - Go, go, go. Come on, we are late. Bye. - Bye. Get in. Take your bag. Bye, dad. - Bye. Sarah... I kept 100 rupees beside the TV for the electricity bill. The due date is gone. If we don't pay they will cut the power this evening. I need to buy a gift for Nani's birthday. How much? - 500 rupees. Did you go to the lawyer? No, I'll go today. What's keeping you busy? You watch cricket on TV all day and smoke cigarettes. You have nothing else to do. Do you have any plans to start working again? The roof has been leaking for days. I've been telling you since a month to talk to the owner and get it fixed. Sarah, I need 500 rupees. You have a son who wants expensive things but you don't have a wife who earns that much. Sorry, I don't have money. Why are you lying to me? I know you have money in your account. Oh, you know? But I won't give you. Okay? Pay the electricity bill without fail. And meet the lawyer... Hey, Rajesh. Not today. I've a lot of work to do. Give us the keys. Go do your work and come back. Come inside. - Hi. Hello. We had a fight this morning. That's why I brought alcohol. No alcohol, please. She said she'll come early this evening. Will you have rum? Hi, boss. Hi. - Hi. What took you so long? Who's that guy who's wearing shades inside the house? Where did you find him? He came from Amalapuram to become a hero. I met him today morning. He got a small role in a bar scene so I brought him here to rehearse for it. The poor fellow looks naive. He is naive but he is super rich. He sponsored the drinks for today. Cheers, man! - Cheers! Will you play? No, I've work. We are six of us. You'll get 500 if you win it. Rajesh! Yes? - I want to play too. That's the spirit. Let's show these guys what you are capable of. I almost forgot. If you win you'll have to forget the 100 rupees I owe you. Hey! - Give him place. Sit down. I didn't even start yet and you are eyeing my prize.Sit down. Cut it. - Take it. I don't drink alcohol, Arjun. He said his friend is shooting a bar scene so I'm practicing for it. An actor needs dedication. I'm sorry I didn't introduce him to you. He's Raju Babu, a movie actor. Movie actor? I thought his face looks familiar. You remember the movie we saw last week? When the hero's friend dies, he stands beside the coffin and swears that he won't rest until he kills the villains. Who was in the coffin in that scene? Our Raju Babu. Really? - Yes. Did you see my face in the coffin? And he says my face looks familiar. Take a card. Arjun, this house looks like government quarters. But it is filled with cups and trophies. Are you a sports person or a government employee? He was both at one time but now he's neither. What do you mean? He quit cricket and they fired him from the job. How can they fire you if you quit cricket? No, Raju. Do you remember two years ago when there were complaints about increased corruption they did an investigation and suspended 15 employees from the Gowliguda FCI? He was one of them. The case is still in court. Until the final verdict comes out all the 15 employees are under suspension. What about you, Raju? Since when did you want to become a hero? When I was a little kid, hero Nageshwar Rao came to our village to shoot for the movie Aaradhana. Raju, you were talking about Akkineni Nageshwar Rao's movie this morning? I thought you were referring to Chiranjeevi's movie. So you are from way back. That's right. I got interested in movies after I saw that shoot. Show! 20% percent commission or you'll forget yesterday's 100? Yeah right. Shall we play another game? - I don't have money. Give me the matchbox. 'The prime minister of India Atal Bihari Vajpeyee...' Dad, when will buy me the jersey? Dad, I told my friends today that you are buying me a jersey for my birthday. [indistinct news playing on television] Dad, jersey! Dad, jersey! Dad, jersey! What's that on your face? Come here. Come to me. Does it tickle here? I said I'll buy it for you. Indian jersey for his birthday... I told you this morning. I told you to talk to the owner. Did you do that? No, I'll talk to him tomorrow. He never asked me anything before, Sarah. Did you go to the lawyer? I'll go tomorrow. Didn't you pay the electricity bill? Sarah... Why are you so irresponsible? Don't you understand what we are going through? We haven't paid the house rent in 3 months. We are drowned in debts. Next month we have to pay Nani's school fee. How can you be indifferent? Dad! Some uncle came and cut the power. Let's light candles. - Yes. Arjun, you are next. Where is Arjun? - He went to the washroom. He went to the washroom now? He's the next batsman. Do you think this is a joke? Where are you going that side? Washrooms are this way. I'll bring him. Arjun! Arjun! Arjun... Arjun... It's your turn to bat. Coach is angry. Come on. He's calling you. Go. One last kiss. Now go. Go. I said I want to kiss you. It's your turn to bat. Coach is angry. Come on. Is It? Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. She's the reason he plays so well every time. Anyone can play well with a warm-up like this. Speak softly. He's a mad man. What? Will he beat me up? Hey! Arjun! Stop! Arjun, no! Stop! Stop! Let him go! Hey, no! Stop! Arjun! Arjun, let him go! Hey! I said let him go! Stop it! Let him go! Will you kill him? He'll die! Hey, wait! Leave my hand! Let him beat him up. Don't stop him. - We are getting late. He doesn't do anything for me. Let him do this. Coach is calling him. - Come back. Come on. Hey! Rascal! We are getting late. You ruined it. Get lost. Meet me in the Cafe tonight. Bye. He does this every time. It's not enough to be a good player. He needs to be disciplined. You always defend him. Ask him where he was. I've seen many talented men like you but I haven't seen anyone who made it big without discipline. I won't tolerate it if you repeat this again. Go. I said I've seen many talented men like him, that's a lie. I've never seen anybody like him in my career. He's different. Dad, there's someone I love. I need to tell you something. Listen! - Yes, sir? Bring me the sauce. Pay attention. I'm saying something very important. Tell me. I told my dad about us last night. You told him? What's that reaction? What? You told him? Don't overdo it. Now pay attention. Please talk to dad once. Or else, it will be difficult for me to meet you. What do I say at home every day? I don't know if I can convince him for our wedding. If he sees you, he'll definitely agree. Drink it. Open the bottle and drink all of it. I've discussing an important matter with you and all you can think of is the sauce. Look at me. - No. Look at me. - No. Listen to me, Sarah. Samosas are getting cold. Let's... Get lost. No, I can't take him into my home. Dad, you don't even know him. Just give him a chance. Sarah, if my own daughter marries a person from another religion how can I face people? Mr Paul, we are older ones. If we think everything through in a calm way everything will fall in place. We can't achieve anything by being angry. Arjun has no family, but I'm there for him. Ask him to convert. No, dad. He will not. - Okay... No, I don't want Arjun to change anything for me. But... - I love him as he is. No, dear. Calm down. He's your father. He just said it in his anger. Why are you so mad about him? He's a local cricketer after all. Nothing more. If he had any talent he would've been selected in the national team by now. What did you say? Do you have any sense? What do you know about Arjun's game? What is this? - Sir, let's go. How dare he! What does he mean by that? Sarah, where are you going? Wait! - Leave it. Arjun... Thanks. Are you going out of town? I'll go take a shower. Then we'll get married. What's that wound? What happened? Nothing. I want to quit cricket, Sarah. How can you quit cricket? It's your life. No, Sarah. I have you now. That's enough for me. Darling... Who is more important to you, me or him? You. Thank you. Don't forget to go to the lawyer today. Getting lots of complaints nowadays. What's happening with you all? Good morning, sir! What's your shift time? 8 o' clock, sir. What's the time now? - I'm sorry, sir. There was no electricity at home last night. Deal with all your personal problems at home. If you can't solve them, quit work and sit at home. I don't want to listen to any of those things here. - Okay, sir. All of you, get back to your work. Ignore it, Sarah. You know how he is. Yeah. Come. What's wrong? Another fight at home? We don't shout or scream at each other at home. I shout, I feel bad, then I cry. He wasn't like this before our wedding, Laxmi. Sometimes I feel responsible for this change in him. My folks were pressurizing me at home so I forced Arjun to marry me. As soon as we got married and settled down he quit cricket. But later I realized that he didn't just quit cricket he stopped being the Arjun that I fell in love with. One, two, three... There are 4 almonds in it. You are very lucky. I've been jobless for 2 years. We constantly fight at home about it. I don't know any other work. But if I get 4 almonds in the almond milk worth 5 rupees I'm a very lucky man? Yes, man. I got only 3. Listen. - Yes. I need some money. I'll give them back in a month. You've a lot of expectations from me, man. Do you know something? I don't have money to pay for this almond milk too. You don't have money for it? - No. Then why did you call me to drink it? Don't be silly. Just because the movie posters say See it today, doesn't mean you'll get free tickets. You need to spend money to buy them. It's the same. Sir! Did you bring money? No, sir. - Then why did you come? Sir... This girl joined work as my new assistant. My old assistant had to take maternity leave. I didn't make her pregnant. I didn't even know that she was married. The reason I'm telling you this is I met your friend when that girl joined the job. I told him to arrange 50,000 rupees and I'll help him to get his job back. I've been telling him for two years. But, he is a righteous man. He doesn't want to do it. Sir, he doesn't have money even to buy almond milk... I told you that I did nothing wrong, sir. I wasn't involved in it... - Do you think that money is for me? There won't be anything left for me. I need to pay the policemen auditor, food inspector evidence room in-charge. After paying all of them, I'll hardly have 10,000 left. Everybody that worked with you paid the money and got their jobs back. But I don't know why you still don't get it. Did you get it? Yes, sir. - What? He lost his job because they suspected him of taking bribes. Now he has to give a bribe to get his job back. You've no money, but have lots of attitude. Sir, my job. We've had three new prime ministers this year. If they can lose their posts, you can lose your job too. Man, why did you ask me for money this morning? Why do you need money all of a sudden? Come. Tomorrow is Nani's birthday. He asked me to buy a jersey as a birthday gift. It costs 500 rupees. Okay, jersey is the t-shirt that cricketers wear, right? Idiot. You should use friends like me for such things. Come on, let's go to Koti. Who needs 500 rupees? We'll get a fantastic jersey for 50 rupees. An exact copy of the original. Even Sachin Tendulkar can't tell the difference. Let's go. Get down. I said get down. - But... Man... Never give me such stupid ideas again. He may not realize it, but my heart knows what I gave him. Okay, I've another idea. Let's go. Let's go. I'll explain it on the way. It's a good idea. Come on, start. Ask him. Hurry up, guys. I've work. I need some money. I'll give it back in a month. How much? - 500 rupees. Is that it? Then why did you hesitate so much? Nani's birthday. Did I ask you the reason? You worry too much. I don't have that much cash. Do one thing. Go home and take from Paddu. I'll call her. Paddu? There was a big fight last time. It's okay. She said those things because she didn't know us. Don't worry. Go take it from her. I'll call her. Let's do one thing. I'll take it from you tomorrow. I'm going to a camp tonight. Take it day after tomorrow. I'll be in the bank. No need. Call her right now. We'll take it from her. Let's go. - But... Come to our sport after you come back from the camp. Let's go. - Bye. Should we ask Paddu again? Who will dare to go inside and ask Paddu for money? Why is everyone looking at me? I won't go. Please, man. Why are you trapping me? I don't know why they named her Paddu. She literally keeps account of everything. Please, man. Don't you remember what a mess I made last time? Same story. Anil went out of town and we came here for... Not every day is the same. Think positive. Okay. I'll ask her. But you've to come with me. Looks like it is your lucky day. I think she'll give you money without making a scene. Do you think she'll really give the money? Yes. She might be counting it. Is it nice? Right. You don't have money when I ask you. But you always have money to give it to your friends to eat and drink. Where did you keep it? I can't see it. They owe us 10,000 rupees already. Rajesh owes us 5,500. Now he wants another 500? Do they think this is a bank to withdraw money any time? A bank has fixed timings. So what if they hear me? Do you think I care? I gave them a nice scolding the other day but they are here again without shame. But you don't want me to say a single word. Yes, I got the money. Okay, I'll call you later. Why did she say 5,500 when I owe them only 5,000? Do you think she counted the 500 they gave me on my wedding day? Okay, everyone remove what they have. 5... - Give it to me. You are all sorted for tonight, my man. You can buy a quarter bottle of rum and half a pack of cigarettes with this money. Have a drink and forget your worries. Take it. Oh my! Where have you been? I've been searching for you since evening. You are very lucky. I told him that when I counted the almonds this morning. Come to the point. Hyderabad Club versus New Zealand. I told you about the charity match, right? I spoke about it yesterday while having tea. A batsman spot is vacant in Hyderabad Club Team. I spoke to them. About what? It was very difficult. But they agreed since it is a charity match. Otherwise there was no chance. I don't understand what you are saying. You are playing tomorrow. All the board members will see tomorrow's match. Once they see you in action they will definitely make you the assistant coach. After that you can happily do what you like to do. Sir, wait a minute. I respect you a lot. And thank you so much for working so hard for me. You mean you don't want to play? Do you realize what you are rejecting? I don't want to go back there, sir. Listen to me. This is the right job for you. I'm still an assistant coach at this age. But with your talent, you can become the main coach. I understood everything. I'll talk to him. Come with me. - What... What are you trying to do? I've an idea. Mr Murthy will surely have money. Ask him. No, I can't do that. It's okay. It won't be worse than asking Paddu. Ask him 600 rupees. - Why 600? 100 bucks for us for tagging along since morning. Nobody has a bigger reason than you to play tomorrow's match. Others play such matches for the 1,000 rupee match fee. But nobody has real interest in the game. Mr Murthy, I convinced him. You convinced him? - Yes. He agreed? - Yes. He agreed. You didn't agree when I spoke to you but you listened to this idiot. But it's okay. - But sir... Go home, take your kit and come to the ground. Sir... - I'll change and come. We'll practice two hours. Don't worry about it. They won't telecast the match on national television. Just go and hit a square cut and a cover drive. We'll get 1,000 rupees. 500 for you and 500 for us. Shall we go? - Yes. Come soon. We'll wait at the ground. Hurry up. 500 for us, right? - Let's go. Dad! Mom and I are here. We are inviting aunt for my birthday tomorrow. Wow! An SG bat! Is it yours, dad? Where's mom? - She's coming. Where are you going? Backyard. Hurry up. Mom is coming. Come on, hurry up. Nani, will you drink Horlicks? - No. [cricket playing on television] Let me come with you, dad, please. No, I'll get very late. You go to sleep. Please, dad. Let me come. I've never seen you bat. Please, dad, please. No. Sarah, I'm going to a movie with Rajesh. Movie? I want to come too. Please, dad, please. - Take him along. He has a holiday tomorrow. - Please, dad, please. Please, dad, please, please, please. Okay, come on. - Yeah! Who's that? You rascal! What does rascal mean? It means all the best. Oh. There's a place where your dad and I go often. I'll take you there. Come on. Yeah! Let's go! Thank you, mom! - Oh. Good morning, birthday boy. Happy birthday. How's the toy? Hey, listen. Brush your teeth. Go and hurry up, okay? I'll keep this there. Wow! Happy birthday. Thank you, dad! After the match, on our way back home we'll stop at uncle's shot to buy the jersey. Really? I made dal and curry. Cook rice one hour before eating. Okay? All the best! Thank you, sir. - Come on, Nani. Hey... Stop it... Stop it... Stop! Now dance! Stop! Let's go. Let's go. Some new player. - Really? Now stop. Arjun, you haven't met him, right? Nandu. No. 1 batsman in the club. Arjun. Ex Ranji player. I'm sure you heard about him. I didn't. Then remember it. He might be the assistant coach in our club very soon. Oh. Is he playing? Where were you hiding till now? Were you sitting and waiting for Gavaskar to retire? By the way, you said he might be the assistant coach. I hope there's no danger to your position. If he focuses fully on the game your position will be gone, not mine. Stop it, guys. I said stop it. Go to your seats. Nani, go sit with them. - Okay. It's a big match for Hyderabad Cricket Association. Hey, John Spearman! Look! So, Hyderabad versus New Zealand at LB Stadium. Let's head to the toss. Shall we? - Yes. Tails. - That's tails. You won the toss. - I think we'd like to bat. Good luck! - Okay. The atmosphere today at the stadium is unbelievable. John Spearman, captain of the New Zealand Team presenting a cheque to the chairman of Hope Foundation. The money would be going towards the under privileged children for their education. Look at that! Beautiful as they walk out. Spearman and Andrew are opening the batting for New Zealand. They would like to use this match to get used to the conditions of the sub-continent. Almost like a practice match for New Zealand this must be. Hyderabad would like to give a tough fight this being their home ground. John Spearman opening the batting and Nivas ready to bowl the first ball now. Watch it. Watch it. - That's driven handsomely to the off side. First boundary coming of the first ball. New Zealand, on the mark. Hyderabad giving away runs. Oh, that's a bold shot again done brilliantly, and that's a four. Let's see if these fireworks continue. Here he goes again. That's a six. Wonderful! Really wonderful! Brilliant! Here he goes again. Bang out of the ground. Hyderabad doesn't look pleased at all. They haven't got a single breakthrough yet. Listen, ask him to cover up those drums. We won't need them today. New Zealanders have been having a run party. They are only dealing with boundaries. Andrew going in for the big hits. And that's a boundary too which brings up to 50 for Andrew. What an innings this has been! The coach is very happy. That's it! Oh, yes! That's brilliant timing! He's the man. Good throw, dad! Come on! Catch it! - He hasn't timed that one. Gone straight to Nandan Reddy. For a second it looked like he dropped it. First wicket for Hyderabad. New Zealand setting a big total here. That's a grand total set by New Zealand and more runs are being added to the total. Hit straight for a six. Hyderabad has a huge task at their hands. They need to hit 332 to win the match. Should I get the drums? - Not yet. Wait. Hi! Pitch is too bouncy. They are hitting all boundaries. So, boys. At least give them a tough fight. Don't go down so easily, okay? We need 6.5 runs per over. Nandu, do well. Keep going. Keep going. Sir. - Yes? Arjun is a good player. Shall we send him in the first round? Oh. Will you join in the next round? Boys, get going. Get going. And I want all the boys to play well. Okay now? Huge responsibility on the two opening batsman. Nandan and Srikanth. Hyderabad needs a good start. They should make the most of the field restrictions in the first 15 overs. First ball. That crosses the boundary. Good shot! Good shot. James Wheeler in attack. Oh, that hits the pad. New Zealand appeals and up goes the finger. Hyderabad loses its first wicket quite early in the match. Sir. - Yes? Send Arjun for batting... - Oh God! Mr Murthy, don't start again. - Captain! Required run rate is rising and the captain of Hyderabad Ravinder comes in. That's timed sweetly and the ball goes to the boundary. That's wonderful. Ball is racing to the boundary. 50 partnership between Nandan and Ravinder. Nandan 2 runs away from a half century. That's hit to the leg side and that's a boundary. Nandan Reddy completes a half century. Sir, are you playing? Then I'll go get all our guys. Oh, that's a hard hit. The fielder gets a finger on it but the ball goes to the ground. Should I play the drums now? Wait. I'll tell you when to play. Just wait. Goes again. Ball is in the air he should get it. It's caught. Hyderabad loses a second wicket and captain Ravinder walks back to the pavilion. I told you. Sir... Sir... If another wicket falls... If you trouble me like this, I'll walk out of the ground. Please. I can't take it. New Zealand seems to be in control here. And that's bowled. Can you believe that? Hyderabad loses another wicket. What bowling! Sir! Send him. Yes! Arjun, come on, pad up. Sorry. Wheeler has got two wickets in the last two balls. He's on a hatrick. Let's see if he can do it. Arjun is the new batsman at No. 5 for Hyderabad. 36 year old and ex Ranji player and facing the hatrick delivery. Can he save Hyderabad from embarrassment? Wheeler running to bowl. Will he get another wicket? Oh, that's a hit. What a stroke! Denying a hatrick to Wheeler, ball races to the boundary. Good shot, dad! That is as good as anything from anybody at any time. Not an easy ball to play. But he actually middles it. Come on, boys. - Can Wheeler get a wicket this time? Oh, he has hit it straight. That's a good shot! And the ball is racing to the boundary. Hit the next ball and show me, mate. Come on, man. Send him back. But Wheeler is an experienced bowler. It's not that easy to attack him. I'm sure Wheeler is going to answer back definitely with his next ball. Last ball of this over goes to Wheeler. Gone for a full toss and that has been hit high in the air... Yes! Arjun! Bro! Now get the drums out. Go ahead. Wonderful. What a shot! Brilliant. And again. Well played. It's going, going and gone. Oh, what a performance this is already thanks to this man Arjun. But it all depends on these two players on the field. Chakri hits another shot. 50 partnership for Arjun and Chakri bringing hope to Hyderabad. Oh, he smashes it again. The ball races to the boundary. And it's a four. Hyderabad needs just 45 runs in 30 balls. That's a four again. Change of bowling. He's going front foot misses it and that's out. Chakravarti walking back to the pavilion. New batsman for Hyderabad. Come on, mate. Come on, boys. Let's get another. Bowled him. That's a nice strike. The game now slipping away from Hyderabad. Oh, that's bowled again. Hyderabad now in trouble. 8 wickets down. Vittal walks back. Change of bowling. Praveen, the new batsman. Hit it in the air. There's a man out there... Catch it! Catch it! - Will he be able to catch it? And... Yes, he caught the ball. Hyderabad loses its 9th wicket. Now this game is getting really interesting. It's getting really close. Hyderabad needs 18 runs from just 9 balls. Arjun on strike. That's front foot, he hits it in the air and the ball flies above the fielder into the stands for a six. Now just 12 runs needed from 8 balls. 2 balls left of the over. He goes again. It goes high into the air. Is it caught? No, that's a six. Yes, come on! Catch it! Come on, run! It looks like this man Arjun is going to finish off this match in this over. Last ball of the over. Here he goes again. It's a massive hit. Is it going to be a six? Just short of the boundary, it's a four. Hyderabad just needs 2 runs. This is nail biting. Come on, boys. Nice and sharp, yeah. Fielders closing in the circle. First ball of the last over. Trick shot. Serve another one. Just 2 runs needed from 4 balls. Pressure building, third ball. Now only 3 deliveries remain. Hyderabad so close, yet so far. We need to make 2 runs in 3 balls. Try to do it. Don't panic. Can he take a single and give back the strike to Arjun? Yes, he connects the ball this time. No, no, no! - Arjun says no! Go, go, go back! Sahil is going back. Will he be out? And New Zealand misses a chance to finish off the game. No one seems happy. A terrible misunderstanding from Sahil. Just 2 balls remaining. He has connected the ball. Are they going to go for a run? - No, no! The fielder picks it up. The ball is thrown towards Arjun. Is he going to make it? Yes! - That's a run out! Hyderabad cannot believe it. New Zealand relieved. They have won the match. A brilliant over by Wheeler. Such a close match for Hyderabad. Yes, they almost won the match. Hyderabad couldn't have lost this match after such an amazing innings by Arjun. Yes, he came in when there was no hope left. He must be thinking If only I got that single. New Zealand team appreciating his efforts. Yes, this man deserves all the applause. Well done, Arjun. Super! He played so well. Let's meet the committee members. I think they will want to give you a cheque. Please ask for cash, even if it's a bit difficult to count. You won't have that trouble. This is a charity match. We won't get a single rupee. No? - They will give everything to charity. Charity? - You are pulling Rajesh's leg, right? Why would I pull his leg? The players' fees, tickets, sponsorship everything will go to Hope Foundation. It's a charity match. Otherwise why would New Zealand Team play with our club? Let's go. There is no change in you. Your technique, balance and flow it's exactly the same as 10 years ago. All the committee members are talking about you. The assistant coach's job is in your bag. You played brilliantly, Arjun. - Stop it, sir! Why do you like to torture me? Don't you get it? I don't have place for cricket in my life. I don't want cricket, or this assistant coach's job. The man before you is not the cricketer Arjun. I have a wife and a son... Arjun! Nani, let's go. Dad, your kit! Dad, your kit! Why didn't you tell me before that you play so well? Your square cuts were too good, dad. Yeah! Dad, we crossed uncle's shop. Dad! Dad! We crossed it! Dad! Will you buy the jersey from somewhere else? Answer me, dad. Answer me. Dad, jersey. Dad, jersey. Dad, jersey. Have you gone mad? - Dad, jersey. Dad... Hi, Karthik. - Bye, daddy. Come. Okay. Why are you sitting here? Please welcome the guests and make them sit. I already ate two chocolates. Hey... What happened? How did you get hurt? I got hit by a ball this morning. Did he have to play cricket today as well? My poor baby got hurt on his birthday. Sarah just went inside, Arjun. Were you looking for me? Take these also and go sell them. Go. Were you stealing from your wife in your own home? Every time I think that you can't stoop any lower you prove me wrong. I've been strict with money because I thought that if I save 1,000 rupees from my salary every month we can pay the lawyer and get your job back. How can we live if you keep quitting like this in life? How? Every time I see you being so disinterested in life you make me think that this is all my fault. I can't sleep at nights. I'm talking to you. Say something. Did you see that? You give up and you walk away every single time. You are doing the same thing with your life too. Every time you get hurt, you run away. I'm afraid that someday you will find it difficult to live with me and leave me. When mom asked you how you got hurt why didn't you tell her that I hit you? She will think that I'm telling lies. Nobody will believe that you hit me. Okay, you go home. Come soon, dad. Kiran! Come on! Come on, keep playing. How dare you shout at me? In the past I would've made you run 10 rounds of the ground. I'm your father's age. But I smoke with you, so that makes us friends. Don't worry about it. I already forgot about it. You are right, sir. I can't live outside this rope. I knew it. I knew it. You were born for this game. We'll meet Mr Ramaraju tomorrow. If you can get the assistant coach's position it will be great. The salary is less, but you will love the job. Not a coach, sir. A player. Player? - You heard right. I want to play again. I want to play for the Indian Team. Arjun, look... - I don't want to die every day. You are 36 years old now, Arjun. That's the retiring age in professional sports. I found myself when I was searching for 500 rupees in the last 3 days. I saw the past 36 years of my life. I didn't understand myself in all these years but I finally found myself in the last 3 days. No, sir. I don't want this life. Even though you have the desire to play you are physically unfit to compete, Arjun. I've been disappointing every person who believed in me and believed that I'll achieve something great in my life. You, Sarah, my friends, everyone. Do you know when I finally walked with my head held high again? This morning. When I came out of the ground after the match. When I saw my son there. There. I will do anything you ask of me. But I don't want to bend my head again. I'll start my life again which stopped 10 years ago. I'll do whatever it takes to be in the Indian cricket team. He's not the coach, I think he's a player. Sit down. How can he be a player? Good stroke. Did Coach come? What did he say? He hasn't come yet. - Am I late? You played well yesterday. Boys! I'm Ramappa Gouda. Coach and selection committee member from Karnataka Cricket Board. Hyderabad Team, please fall in line. Rajesh, right hand batsman. - Hi. Ravi, right arm off spin, sir. - Hello. Srikanth, opening batsman. - All the best. Madhav, right hand batsman, sir. Ajith, bowler, sir. - Very good. Hey! You are the assistant coach Murthy, right? I thought Murthy is an older man. You actually look very young. Arjun, right hand batsman. Oh. Okay. Boys, on to the nets. - Yes, sir. Next! Come on, bowl. That's a good ball. Next! Good, next! Next time play forward. Okay? Hey, not you. Next. Good. That's it for the day, boys. See you tomorrow. Hi! - Shall we go? Okay. Everyone is busy, sir. They asked you to come later. Take it. Why do you want to play when you can teach others? At least he's doing something. What about you? Shut up! Don't give him mad ideas. - Yeah right. I told you everyone is busy, sir. Why do you want to come every day? Money. - You asked me the other day. I don't want it. Hi, Arjun. What a surprise! You came at the right time. Come in. It's okay, sir. I'll wait here. Don't worry, Arjun. Murthy explained everything. Come in, let's talk. We appointed two new coaches this time. You go through this list once and give me suggestions. This guy's batting track record is good. Hyderabad hasn't won the Ranchi cup since 10 years. This time we are very serious about it. The one sitting in the corner seat is Atul. Bombay Team Coach. And he's the reason Bombay Team has been winning the Ranchi cup for the past 3 years. The one standing is Gouda. Karnataka Team Coach. I met him in the ground the other day. Oh. You already know him. Let me do this formally. Gentlemen! - 74. Do you remember Arjun? Ex Ranchi player. Retired. He's going to join as the Assistant Coach in our supporting staff. Sir, not as a coach, as a player. What? I want to play again, sir. Wait outside. He's the one who came in when we were in a meeting. Yes, sir. His name is Arjun. 1979 to 85, he played for Ranchi, Tulin and South Zone. I underestimated him too. But look at his records. Impeccable records in first class matches. Highest batting average in the country. Amazing talent. Fantastic batsman. And wonderful technique. If he was really as talented as you say he would be in the team, not on the screen. So, don't waste my time. Sir, he might've had many reasons to quit. Please see the recording of the charity match with New Zealand Team. Gouda, please stop this nonsense, really. He is bloody 36 years old. What will be the use even if we select him? But if we give that place to a youngster it will be a good opportunity in the national team. We need players who have long scope. What's so funny? Do you know actor Rajesh Khanna? I remembered a dialogue from his movie Anand. Tell me. Sir, life should be big, not long. In fact, if you meet Rajesh Khanna you'll argue with him too, right? But trust me. He is really fantastic. Arjun! Into the nets. Pad up. Sir! Good ball, man. Good ball. Hey. This guy is good. You should watch his... Can I borrow your gloves? - Sorry, man. Arjun, we don't have all day. Come on. Where's your glove? - Swing the ball. I can't find it, sir. Do you think this is a joke? Get out! What is this? Super, bro! That's it. One second. I can't find it, sir. That's it. You should've seen his face... If this had happened a week ago I would've laughed along with you. But now I don't have that much time. If you mess with me again... If you two misbehave again you'll never step into the stadium again. Leave the room. Let's go. That girl Ramya. She's a journalist. She wrote this article. There was a long discussion about it in the association meeting yesterday. About this? They are very serious about Ranchi trophy this year. Atul and Gouda selected 35 probables. After two months of training camp they will finalize 15 for the Ranchi team. Don't be so happy. They can eliminate you whenever they want during the two months' training. Did they select me? Why are you smiling? I told you they can eliminate you whenever they want. I told you there's no need to be so excited. Fauja Singh. Running. Age 84. Ed Earle. Kayaking. Age 40. Oscar Swahn. Shooting. Age 60. There are many successful people in every sport who didn't let their age be an obstacle. Do you know how? Age is just a number. Deep inside they are always young. I don't know where this road will lead to. But you are definitely unfit to start the journey. I want the Arjun of 10 years ago. If you want to play for the Indian Team you've to play well for the Ranchi Trophy. You should be seen by the selectors. I'll do whatever you tell me. Okay, let's go. Have you gone mad? Why did you write about him? It's just an article. Leave it. - I can't. You humiliated me. Go apologize to him. What? Thank you. What was that? - I don't know. Why didn't you stop him? What did you do? You said you want the Arjun of 10 years ago. Hey! Is this what I asked you to do? Sir! Hey! Should I serve you dinner? I'm not hungry. I'll eat later. Dad, should I tell you something. I told you that Coach made Rahul the captain because he has an Indian jersey, right? He's not the captain now. He has been removed. I thought he was made captain because of his jersey. But that's not true. I asked you for a jersey, but I don't want it now. It doesn't help to become a captain. Vishal. You said Vishal had a jersey, not Rahul. Sorry, dad. You didn't cause the fight between mom and me. So, boys. We finish the two months' training with today. It's time to announce the top 15. But you've to wait one more day to know the results. Before the results, I want to congratulate all you boys for the fantastic job. All the best! Thank you, sir. - Thank you, sir. They'll announce the results this evening. Are you worried? Are you? - Just a little. Not very. Don't worry even if I don't get selected. We'll try again. Are you telling me to believe in you? Even if I had a son, I wouldn't have believed in him more than I believe in you. I'm not able to handle stress like before. I can't come today evening. Come home after getting the results. I'll bring rum. We'll enjoy it. Remember one thing. No matter what happens this evening I'm always proud of you. You are the best cricketer I've seen in my career. That includes present Indian cricket team. I'm telling you. My name will be in the list. I know it. He's so over confident. Let's see the results. Let me see it. Calm down. Let me see... Okay, see you later. Bye. Good job, Arjun. Ravinder, I wish you and your team all the very, very best. Play well. - Thank you so much, sir. Congratulations. Okay. Sridhar, get in. - Bye, dad. Nandu, come on. - See you, mom. Come on, get inside. Nani! Bye, dad. - Bye. Take care. Okay, bye. Bye, dad. Bye-bye. Bye. Take care. - Bye, dad. Happy journey, dad. Bye. TAMIL NADU V/S HYDERABAD YMCA CRICKET GROUND - CHENNAI Hyderabad shouldn't have chosen to bat first. Yes, the ball has been swinging a lot here. They are 78 for 3. It is just start of the day. They've already lost Nandan Reddy, Raghu and Vijay. Balaji is bowling a brilliant spell here. Just missed. That was close. Good job. - He's really making the ball taught and the Hyderabad captain Ravinder is struggling. That is caught behind. Appeal and the finger goes up. He take another wicket and... Captain of Hyderabad. He's walking back to the pavilion. Arjun, pad up. You are going in next. Okay, sir. Arjun, just stay at the crease. It's okay if you don't make a single run even after playing the whole day. But you've to be there till the very end of the day. Yes, sir. - All the best! Hyderabad cannot afford to lose anymore wickets. Arjun, defend. Don't attack. Srikanth is the next batsman. Oh, looks like they are sending a different player. Come on. Be careful with this bowler. Okay? He by far has to be the oldest player in this Ranchi season 1996. Let stump, Umpire. All of 36 years. Let's see if he can bring any of his experience into this match. Well, Arjun seems to be checking the field placement here. Ready to face his first ball of the match. Pitched up and it's in the air. Will this be another wicket? No, it beats the fielder and that's a six. Good job! Unorthodox indeed! I mean who hits a six on the first ball on day one of a 4 day Ranchi match? Well, you know what, Shashi, Arjun was also one of the highest run scorers in the 86-87 Ranchi season. Ball in the air again. Will this be a boundary? Yes! It's out of the boundary and it's a six! Can he get a hatrick? We'll have to wait and see. Well, Balaji is certainly not pleased with that one. He wouldn't have seen that coming. Arjun is scanning the ground for any gap. Yes, he goes for it again hitting straight over the bowler and this one goes farther than the previous two shots. What an amazing innings he has been playing. Unbelievable! Good shot! - Brilliant! Second boundary of the over. More runs. This is turning out to be a good partnership between Arjun and James Noyal. And that shot brings his 50. Wonderful! Hit again for a four. That's another boundary. Just 4 runs away from a century. That's a single. What an innings he's been playing! And now just 3 runs away from hitting a century. Oh, he hit it again, the fielder couldn't stop the ball and the ball hits the boundary and that brings a century for Arjun. Keep going. Keep going, Arjun. Hyderabad batsman Arjun's batting has been very entertaining even for Tamil Nadu supporters. What an innings it has been! Absolutely unbelievable! Good job, Arjun! Good job! Arjun! - Well played, Arjun! Good job, Arjun! Superb! Good job, James! - Very good! Well played. - Congratulations! Well played, Arjun. - Good game, James. Did you see his range of shots? Are you thinking that you played well? You put the whole team at risk with your batting adventure. What did I tell you? You said the wicket shouldn't fall till the end of the day. Well played. Good shot, Arjun! Mom! Mom! Mom! Dad's photo. - You are getting late for school. Read me what it says. In an unexpected result Hyderabad batsman Arjun made Hyderabad win. Thank you. GOA V/S HYDERABAD FATORDA STADIUM, MARGOA - GOA BIHAR V/S HYDERABAD GYMKHANA GROUND - HYDERABAD HARYANA V/S HYDERABAD GYMKHANA GROUND - HYDERABAD Vizianagaram... - Wait a minute. Hyderabad Team defeated Andhra Pradesh Team with 4 wickets. Arjun scored 154 runs... - Your dad! We are in the lead now. Yes! - Congrats, Mr Murthy! And the actual tournament starts now. Yes! Well done, boys! Hello, Hotel Taj! How can I help you? Hello? Hello? A player in your mind? - Yeah, I've a player in my mind. BCCI HEADQUARTERS MUMBAI His name is Yuvraj. And he's from Punjab. He made 3 centuries against Tamil Nadu Team. Oh. 3 centuries? That's good. - He took 20 wickets also. Hello, sir! - Any updates? Mumbai on top, as usual. EDEN GARDENS KOLKATA Also sir, there's a player from Hyderabad you should make note of. Who? - Arjun. Right hand batsman from Team Hyderabad. Hey, catch the ball. Nani! Your dad was in the papers again today. Okay, you go do fielding. Dad! Ramya, please understand. I can't do this. Nandu, just one hour. - Why don't you understand? Even one hour is not possible. Okay? It's really not your fault. It is Nandu's fault. But still, stay close and fight with him. Don't go away. It's very difficult to deal with such situations if we don't have the support of our dear ones, Ramya. No matter how much Sarah and I fought she always supported me. She took it upon herself to care for the family. If she hadn't believed in me I wouldn't be playing like this today. Trust me. He needs you more than ever. SAHARA STADIUM - LUCKNOW I really like your game, Arjun. Your every shot is so perfect. Like... Straight from the text book. If I practice, maybe I can play like you. But... The way you spoke to Ramya that day that I can't do. Thanks. Arjun, I'm sorry for what I did. Let's play for the team. UTTAR PRADESH V/S HYDERABAD Your client Arjun's photo is in the papers, sir. Arjun! Work on your fitness first. You'll always hit fours and sixes? No singles? Every single is important. Now run 5 runs of this ground. Run. Come on, go. HYDERABAD V/S MAHARASHTRA L.B. STADIUM - HYDERABAD Hyderabad is going to semi finals. Yes! We'll win the cup this time! Boys! Boys! Boys! Hold it! Hold it! Hold it! It's too early for celebration. 'He doesn't let us have fun even for 5 minutes.' I'll get changed. We'll go out. Okay. What will you have, sir? Two teas. Do you remember this place? I remember the table too. Listen... I'm very sorry. I did a mistake. I said many hurtful things to you. I'm very sorry. It's okay. We won't have any problems in our life now. Everything will be normal. Not just normal, we'll be happy. Dad came home. He said he'll give us 50,000. You go and pay the lawyer immediately. I'll resign right away. I can't work there anymore. Happily, let's just go back to our normal life. It's been so long since we all had a good laugh at home. Did you take money from your dad? Please don't be angry with me. I didn't take it. Dad just said he'll give it to us. We don't have to take it if you don't want to. Just leave it. It's okay. No. It's not about money. You don't believe in me, do you? Don't you dare say that, Arjun! Don't you dare say that! I left my family and came to live with you. Don't you dare say that! I don't want any of these things. I just need a simple life. You, me and Nani, that's it. I just want you back, that's it. I don't care about what's going on in your game. You can't do anything now no matter how hard you try. You had your chance and it's over now. I heard this many times, Sarah. You can't do anything. You can't do anything. I felt very sad every time I heard it. But hearing it from you is making me scared. I'm scared that maybe I won't be able to do anything. I'm angry with you for the first time in my life. DELHI V/S MAHARASHTRA GYMKHANA GROUND - HYDERABAD That's hit hard. The ball is going, going and gone. The ball has gone out of the ground and... Another six by Arjun! What an innings this is turning out to be! The ball is going to the boundary again. A fielder is... Oh, the fielder stopped it. Hyderabad, very close to winning the semi finals. Another century for Arjun in the tournament. Hey! Congrats, man! Arjun? - Did he injure himself? I think they should call for the physio. Physio! - Yeah, they are. Is he alright? Oh no, he doesn't look very alright to me. Must be dehydration. These weather conditions can get really tough on you. He refuses to get aid. Well, he seems to be doing okay now. And he lifts his bat for his century. Well, what a man! What an innings! Well played, Arjun! Hey, champion! Well played. I don't feel good, sir. Shall we go to the hospital? I don't think there's anything to be worried about. It may be because of too much strain. It will be good to get a TMT and 2D Echo. Doctor, we've the Ranji finals match in Mumbai next week. Is it okay for him to play? First get these tests done. How can you say that, sir? There's no need to worry, dear. That's what the doctor said. The selectors are coming to the match next week. This match is very important to Arjun. Otherwise all his efforts till date will go waste. He's lying on the bed without knowing what his condition is. How can you talk about next week's match? Sarah, please. Please let me talk. The doctor prescribed some tests, right? We've to wait till the month end to get my salary to get those tests done. What is he doing leaving me and Nani at home? Why are you still giving him false hope, sir? Listen... I think it's time for you to decide. Do you want me and Nani or do you want cricket? If you want cricket, we won't be in your life anymore. You decide. Hi, Arjun. - Hello. Nandu. - Hi. Hi. - Hi. Does your family always smile like this? Dad, there are paint brushes in the cupboard. Will you get them for me? I can't reach them. Come on. I gave Sachin's poster to Raju. None of my friends had their dads' photo in the papers. I have this photo. So I gave Sachin's poster to Raju. Dad, won't you play cricket again? You tell me. Should I play or not? Play, dad. You play very well. You look like a hero. Sarah madam! Sarah madam! Sarah! Sarah! Nani went outside to play. I can't live like this, Sarah. I just can't. I'm not doing it to spite you. Do you know something? If anyone lends me money they don't ask it back. Do you know why? Not because they like me. Because they are convinced that I can't pay them back. The people I know and the people who know me gave up hopes on me long back. Once upon a time I was a good cricket player. Now I'm a loser. It's not their fault that they think that. Because I was like that. In this big world, the only one who didn't judge me till date is my son. He doesn't care whether his dad is working or not earning or not, whether he's successful or not. I'm his dad. That's it. He never asked me anything till today, Sarah. I don't know why he asked me to buy him a jersey. But I couldn't buy him that. Do you know what my fear is? If I stay like this, maybe he'll view me like others one day. He told me earlier that I look a hero to him when I play cricket. I can't bear it if he thinks any less of me, Sarah. Let me go, Sarah. Please. I'm not angry with you. Should I tell you whom I'm angry with? The Arjun who sits on the sofa every day and watches cricket without doing any work. The Arjun who couldn't fulfill Nani's small wish. The Arjun who makes you cry in the kitchen. I'm not angry with you, Sarah. Not at all. You'll be tired tomorrow if you travel all night in the train. Morning 5 am flight. I booked a hotel with the travel desk. Please stay the night with me without thinking anything. Who is more important to you? Me or Nani? You. Don't lie to me. RANJI FINAL - 1996-97 MUMBAI V/S HYDERABAD WANKHEDE STADIUM - MUMBAI Welcome to the Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai. This is day one of the Ranji finals between Mumbai and Hyderabad. This is the match both the teams have been waiting for. - My dad! And this is the decider... - Look, our Arjun! It's a full house and first ever day and night Ranji match in the history of Ranji Tournament. Home ground for Mumbai and Mumbai won the toss and elected to bat. This is a crucial toss to win, and the wicket will get tougher as the match progresses. First ball, and Mumbai gets off the mark. That is driven. The ball races to the boundary. It's a four. Straight down the ground. Another four. Hyderabad cannot believe it. Easy runs, goes into the crowd. Oh, bowled him. Finally a wicket for Hyderabad. Spectacular innings by the batsman. It's Day 2 and Mumbai is boasting a massive score. That's another six. - Wonderful! Good shot! - More runs for Mumbai. That's a massive score. All the best! - Let's do it. Three slips and a gully. Shammi bowling the first ball. What a bouncer! Oh! He didn't know where it went! Taken. That is bowled. Bowled again. He just knows what he's doing. Shammi gets another wicket. Hyderabad Team total 45 for 4 at the end of the Day 2. Day 3 of the Ranji finals. And Hyderabad needs a savior. Will Arjun come to their rescue? No, it's not him. Shammi knocks over Arjun. Mumbai is celebrating. Walking back to the pavilion the danger man Arjun departs. Another wicket for Hyderabad and they are falling down like a house of cards. Bowled him. - Takes the catch. Out. - The finger goes up. That's a catch in the wind. Catch it. Clicked away for a four. Runs are pouring for Mumbai. Pulled away for another boundary. Mumbai in a comfortable lead and on the verge of winning the match and the Ranji Tournament. What's with your useless fielding? That's more than enough for your useless bowling. No matter what we say now or how hard we play it's all in vain. We saw how those guys are playing. There's no chance that we can win the match. All our hard work for the past 6 months is all in vain? It's a great achievement for us to reach here. 47 overs and 352 is the target, sir. Required run rate is 7.47. Even if the match is a draw, as per the innings rule Mumbai's first innings score is more, so they will win. If we want to win the match, we've to chase this target. Last day the pitch was very unpredictable, sir. 352 in 47 overs is very hard. Change in plans for Hyderabad. Arjun who bats for Hyderabad on fourth round is now opening alongside Nandan Reddy in the second innings. Mumbai has a lead of 351 runs and boy, they must be happy. So close to winning the Ranji Tournament here in Mumbai. They must be celebrating. Wonderful really, Mumbai. You know, they started celebrating. Hyderabad has to do something magical if they want to win this match. And 351 runs in just 47 overs on a Day 4 pitch seems just beyond possible. Arjun at the batting end and Shammi all ready to bowl the first ball of the second innings. Oh, that's a deadly bouncer. Shammi attacking with the ball. Shammi trying to play it dirty. Trying to distract the batsman. Does the batsman have a reply to that one? Oh, pulled perfectly. What a terrific shot! That's a 50 partnership for Arjun and Nandan Reddy. Oh, great shot! They need those singles. Good running between the wickets. And good understanding between the batsmen as well. That is played to the off side. A call for the second. More running between the wickets. And Arjun gets to his half century. This man is making his intentions quite clear. What a crucial innings! Doesn't dad lift his bat when he completes 50 runs? No, he lifts it only when he makes a century. Will Hyderabad have a chance here? 230 runs required out of 210 balls. Oh, front foot, and misses the ball. The keeper doesn't miss the opportunity. The finger goes up and Nandan Reddy departs. Hyderabad looking to keep up with the required run rate. Another four. The ball goes high in the air. A fielder coming in, and it's taken. James throws his wicket away. Oh, Ravinder completely misses that one. That is hit hard. The ball is traveling over the boundary. This man Arjun hits all around the park. Come on, man. Come on, we need a wicket. Arvind Chopra is ready to bowl. How will Arjun get to his century? That is an unbelievable hit. Will this go all the way? There's a fielder coming under it. He doesn't reach it. That's a six. Arjun hits yet another a century! Yes! - What an innings! I think Hyderabad needed that boost. Well played, Arjun! Clearly my man of the tournament. The question is, does Hyderabad have a chance here? Hyderabad is doing the right thing here. Taking runs between the wickets not leaving any opportunity to do so. More running between the wickets. The ball races to the boundary. Well driven. Shot! Hit straight for a six. Just a little touch of the bat. Shammi blocking the way but Arjun manages to reach the crease in time. That is the most I've seen him run. He usually deals in boundaries. Today is another story. He knows the importance of singles at this moment. Every run counts and every run takes him closer to the target. That's lifted in the air and an easy catch for Shammi. That's bowled. Another wicket. That is quick. Mumbai appeals and the finger goes up. Hyderabad loses its sixth wicket. It's 285 for 6. 67 required of 36 balls. New batsman Anil at the crease. Will they take another single? No, they don't. Arjun doesn't seem pleased. He wants to have a word with Anil. - Anil! Run rate is increasing. Just keep running. Singles are very important to us. That is hit between the fielders. Shammi blocking the way. Arjun falls, but manages to reach the crease. Oh, this is getting heated. Nasty tactics by Mumbai. An umpire intervenes just in time. This is not done. Shammi shouldn't have done this. Bowled him. Another wicket. Hyderabad cannot afford to lose a wicket at this stage of the game. Anil walking back at 289 for 7. The required run rate is rocketing. Will that be another wicket? It's given. Shammi causing mayhem. He is on a hatrick. Hyderabad losing the plot here. 289 for 8. Hyderabad needs some big h hits. Shot! - Second boundary of the over. Another one. Hitting the fielder on the off side. Shammi again in the way and this time Arjun gets the better of him. More runs here. The ball goes into the crowd. Will that be another wicket? Yes! Safe hands. Hyderabad throwing away another wicket. 305 for 9. They require 12 runs per over. Mumbai just one wicket away from winning the Ranji trophy. Wajid Khan. The last batsman at the crease. There must be immense pressure on the young man. That's a good ball. Taking the batsman by surprise. Another dud ball. Can he get a single? Punch to the bowler. They run, they don't run. Oh, back in the crease just in time. Wajid! The last over was a maiden over. Arjun is at the crease. Shammi going to bowl the last second over. That is hit above the square leg. No man at hand. That goes to the boundary. Let's see what Arjun can do in this crucial over. Will he turn the game around? Come on, boys! Come on! That finds the gap between the point and the gully. Another boundary. 24 runs now required of 9 balls. Comes down the crease and hits straight. Miraj trying to reach it but doesn't. That's a six. More runs. 18 of the over already. - Yes! Arjun would want to take a single here. Fielders closing in. Will he get a run? No! Exactly what the Mumbai wants him to do. And Hyderabad disappointed. What will they do now? Don't worry. 6 balls, 14 runs. It's okay, Wajid. Wajid! Wajid! We are playing the finals, Wajid. Go and strike! Come on, guys! Come on! Come on! 14 runs required in the last over. Wajid on strike. Will he take a single and get Arjun back on strike? Oh, that was close. He misses the first ball. No chance for a run. It's 14 runs of 5 balls now. He misses it again. Mumbai successful in not giving them a single. What will Hyderabad do now? 14 runs required of 4 balls now. It's high time they get a single or they are losing the match. Abhay ready to ball. The tension is building. This is the third ball of the last over. And Hyderabad needs a single. Will they get it? Oh, he misses it again, but they are running. Will it be an out? Keeper throws it. It misses the wicket. Abhay throws it back. It strikes. What's that? - It's an appeal here. Is Hyderabad losing its last wicket? Umpire says not out. - Come on, Arjun! Hyderabad now needs 13 runs of the last 3 balls. Will this man finish it off for Hyderabad? This needs to be a big shot. This needs to be a boundary. Abhay bowling the fourth ball of the over. Will Arjun do it for Hyderabad? Square cut. Beats the cover and races to the boundary. And that's a four. Come on, Arjun! - Hyderabad still has a chance here. 9 runs required of the last 2 balls. - Yes! Is Hyderabad going to snatch this match away from Mumbai? Mumbai cannot believe it. Are they going to lose this tournament? They don't seem very happy. Will this man hit another biggie? They need a six for sure. Fifth ball of the over. What is going to happen? Oh, he hits it hard. The ball is going. Will it land in the crowd? Yes, it does. What a shot! Unbelievable! Yeah, sixer! - 'This man is on fire!' 'Good for Hyderabad. What an innings!' 'Abhay completely clueless about Arjun.' Yes! Yes! Hyderabad now requires only 3 runs of the last ball. The team knows that Arjun can finish it off for them. Just one more boundary is all he needs to hit. Will he do it again? Mumbai setting the field now. They don't want to give another boundary. Yes! Come on! Come on! Come on Arjun! Throw the ball! Throw it! Come on, Arjun! Run! Run! Hurry up, throw the ball! Run! Come on, come on, come on! Run, Arjun! Run! Come on, Arjun! How's that? Will he lift the finger? And he said no. Yes! - Hyderabad wins the match. Can you believe it? What an innings this has been! Arjun makes the win single handedly. Well, Ranji 96-97 is taken by Hyderabad. HYDERABAD 2019 I'll go and find out. Nani! I think it's this way. One second. Sarah! How are you? Hi! Hey! Hey! - Hi! Thanks for coming. - How are you, dear? Coach sir! Good. Hello, uncle! Why did you grow a beard like your dad? You went there to study for 2 years, but stayed back. Then you took your mom too. Don't you want any of us? I'll finish the project by the end of this year, uncle. Then I'll come back to Hyderabad office. Hey, Nani! How are you? - How are you? Hi, Sarah. - Hi. Hello. How are you? - We think about Arjun every day. Thank you. - Excuse me. I need to speak to you for 2 minutes. We have a meeting. You can speak to him after that. It's okay, uncle. Go ahead. I'll talk to him and join you. Come with me. After reading the book about Arjun I thought you don't know the truth. As a doctor, I'm not supposed to talk to everyone. I found out you were coming today, so I came to meet you. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. No matter how great a man is no matter how many great things he achieves someone has to write about him to make him a part of history. We couldn't recognize the greatness of one of our own men. Ramya wrote a book about that great man and made him known to all of us. I'd like to thank her on behalf of our cricket association. We are all so obsessed with success. Our eyes are always focused on successful people. Not just with cricket, but in every aspect of life. We always want to know more about people who are very successful. But not everyone achieves success. Only one out of 100 finds it. Arjun's story is not about that one man out of 100 who finds success. It is about those 99 men who kept trying. After reading this book, I tried to find out what happened after that match, like many of you did. I have the privilege to access the old BCCI documents. This is the list of players who were selected for Indian team for the England Tour after 1996 Ranji finals. And... You know, Arjun got selected for Indian team for England. I'd like to call Arjun's son to come on to the stage please. We have something from the BCCI to present to the family. Go. This is for you. 'Will you really buy a jersey?' 'If you keep your hand on my head and say it it's like a promise.' 'I crossed my fingers too.' 'You can't break the promise now.' Please. Thank you. This is the birthday gift I had asked my dad 23 years ago when I was just 7 years old. My dad's determination was so great that I got the gift I wanted even after so many years. After the Ranji final match in Mumbai my dad was admitted in the hospital. He died of heart failure after two days. And the doctors said that he has a heart disease called Arrhythmia. I just found out that my dad knew about it 10 years before he died. In fact, when he was 26 that was the reason why my dad quit cricket. You have a heart condition called Arrhythmia. Your heartbeat is irregular. So your heart might stop with increased physical stress. You don't have to worry. Just quit cricket. You won't have any problem if you don't take physical stress and come for regular checkups. Okay? Okay, doctor. Leave me alone, sir, please. Arjun! I want to quit cricket, Sarah. Now I have you. That's enough for me. Dad, won't you play cricket again? You tell me. Should I play or not? You play very well. You look like a hero. I'm telling you this because we all think that my dad died trying. That's wrong. My dad kept trying even when he knew he would die. That is my father! 1996 BESANT NAGAR BEACH, CHENNAI. Ready? Dad, give me the camera. How many snaps will we take with just two of us? There's not a single one with all three of us. We have the photos from Shailu's weddings. But he wasn't born yet. But he was there, right? Dad, hold the camera like this and click. We three will come. Dad, do as I say, please. - That's not how you click photos. We three will be there in it. - If we want all of us in it... Please, dad. Do as I say. - Nani, stop whining, please. Please, dad. Do as I say. - Wait a minute. Yes, right there. - Dad, a little to the right. Right here. - Wait. A little to the left.
