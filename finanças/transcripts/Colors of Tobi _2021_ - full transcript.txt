FILMFABRIQ PRESENTS IN ASSOCIATION WITH SPARKS WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE HUNGARIAN NATIONAL FILM INSTITUTE AND THE SUNDANCE INSTITUTE A FILM BY ALEXA BAKONY Hi, my little baby. - Did you feel anything? - No. - I was panicking at the beginning. - Really? I got a sedative. My heart was beating very fast. Mm-hmm. - Did you feel sick? - No. Hi, Jazmin! Hi! She has a pretty mouth, just like her sister. Yeah. Yes... Yes... So, you're definitely a girl. COLORS OF TOBI Okay, kitty cat, I'm coming! Alright, kitty, I'm coming. Cutie pie! Cutie pie! Oh, look at you! Listen up! Four, three, two - very good. Five...six! Once again. - Literature? - A. - English? - A. - I might even get an A+. - German? B. - Maths? - D. I knew it! - History? - D. Both use lots of numbers. You have a D for your chosen subject. I couldn't choose what to learn. - Why not? - Accounting, control, statistics. You already knew what they were going ask. And you got a D? Congrats! Alright... - What was your grade in physics? - Who cares? How about P.E.? It doesn't matter. It's history that matters. See? And now, I'm scolding you. What did you do with your teenage years? Would it have been so hard to learn physics? I was dating your dad. Would it have been hard to learn physics? The subject is, 'Request to change name and gender'. Here it says, 'Gender-change and modification of first name'. - Should we rewrite it? - Let's do that. So, let's write 'Gender-change...' Sign here. - Above the name? - Yes, up there. Sign above the printed name. Let's hope you don't have to write down this name ever again. I already forgot how to write that name. I'm fine, we are doing my papers to get my correct gender and name. If we get this through, you'll owe us two big bars of chocolate. You mean for the officials? Yeah. For your mother and me. He didn't even look at us, now he's paying attention! Every time. Go like this. Like this? I can't. - Wait! - Try it. Mum! There are a lot of things that people who are not gay or transgender are really interested in. How do these things happen? Let me give you an example. Stretch your eyelids. - How? - Like that. There is a lesbian couple and a gay couple. - Yes? - They want to have kids. They won't do 'that' with each other. That's what I wanted to ask. Why do they need adoption or artificial insemination? Why can't they just 'do it' for this one occasion, as long as the gay man sleeps with the lesbian woman? They aren't attracted to each other. That question is so stupid. - Don't open your eyes. - I'm sorry. It's such a stupid question that even I feel bad about it. Can't you see? This is the problem. That... We heterosexuals can't have any questions? - You can, but... - We just don't know things. You can ask, but just imagine yourself having to have sex with a woman just once. OK, you're right. OK. I'll hug you. - We'll shake hands later. - Hug me. I'll help you with the luggage. - Why, because I can't? - No. ORGANISER They did some reorganising, they placed the MTV van here and some sort of technical car, so we'll be between those two cars. SIN IS NOTHING TO BE PROUD OF Filthy fags! Ban it! YOUR DEVIANCE IS DISGUSTING Ban it! TEAM OF SUPPORTIVE PARENTS It's a made-up problem, that parents are unable to answer their children, when they see a gay couple walk hand in hand and kiss each other. To them, two people, who are smiling at each other, who are able to show their love they don't mean a symbol for sexuality. Instead, it shows two people who respect each other. Why is it harmful that your child loves someone of the same sex? What if your kid is transgender? Why should they suffer when they just want to live their life happily? Before I talked about these things, I was living in the prison of my soul. Yes! We parents have to come out as well! It's liberating! Try it! - Hello! - Hi, Dad! Are you sleepy? Didn't you have enough sleep? Nice parking job. He might've felt like doing that. Dad, can you take me to school on Monday? I'm working a night shift on Monday, I can give you a ride in the morning. - Oh no! - What's wrong? I changed my picture on purpose! And now you're putting it back. Where is my picture? I don't know where Dad put it. This was the first time you asked me to cut your hair short. That's when I first cut it short. - Look how happy I was! - Yeah. Here, on your 4th birthday, I bought you this bloody expensive toy pram and you immediately gave it to your sister. - Do you remember? - Yeah. You should've bought me a remote-control car. This is the very last girly picture. He doesn't want to see it. I love this one as well. You were so cool, weren't you? You only like my girly pictures. Why does that bother you? That was you as well. No. - Can you help Dad? - OK. OK. You can't say that we don't have style. Dad. Dad. Tobi, we're waiting for you. Hello! Oh no, it's started. If you're that slow, it'll be over by the time you come here. Don't rush His Majesty. Happy birthday to you! I'm embarrassed! We wish you many more days like this! Aww, you. Here. Thank you. When all of you live in the capital, it'll be easier for us to visit you on holidays. I wouldn't even come here. Hm? Such honesty! - What did he say? - He said he wouldn't come here. Me neither! Me? You know how much we love this village and we have so much room in this house. Why didn't you tell me he liked that? I thought that somebody else would drink Coke. Why did you take off the hat? I don't want to look like a gigolo from 2008 the whole night. Why would you look like that? I don't know. Maybe the chains and that white fedora are quite suggestive. But it looks so great! I really don't get your style. I noticed that. You three have very similar noses: Dad, Máté and you. Niki's is different. - Am I adopted? - The odd one out. It's very interesting because you also don't have the Tuza hair. I didn't say it because of that. You inherited someone else's hair, but from our family, I mean. Family, right? He didn't inherit your beard, honey. His is thicker, but just because he's trimming it. No. His hair is thicker. Thicker, but only because he trims it. My light moustache was too ordinary. I hated it. I want to have one too! Don't. Even the sun bounces off of that. That was disgusting. Who said I was going to keep it light? I was always so sad when you told me: “We want to have a living room, so you'll share your room with 'it'.” Not with your sibling, with 'it'. We never said 'it'. We said Jazmin. But it was like that. You went into her room. - Mum, Mum! Tobi! - Tobi! Yes. It's over. This is a blank slate. But for us, it's just the beginning. I think that I accept him, I do everything for him, I help him with the paperwork and the doctors... Let's see. Yeah. All this just because I accidentally said "Jazmin?" You can't erase the past. It's 16 years after all. I know. I also called him by the wrong name many times. Do you remember when I said, "Happy Men's Day" to Dad? And Tobi said, “Thanks” because I forgot about him? I feel that he doesn't understand us. I won't go in there because I'll cry as well. I never asked you to erase the past. But when you say, "When she was Jazmin, ...when she was a girl." I was never a girl. Please don't be angry, but why don't you go to Tobi? And what can I say? I told him already. It's not that simple. It's like if I told him, “From now on, you can't call me Mum, only Eva.” When we had his original birth certificate, I was going through our documents, I opened it and it said, "Jazmin Tuza, born in Debrecen on 13th February 2000. Gender: female.” I wish I could keep this one paper about her after the gender change. If only this could remain of her. What do you mean weird? It wasn't like this at all before. - You only saw me with light hair. - Yes. - This is the real me. - Wow! It's so black! - Black dye makes black hair: magic! - Shhh. - You really like this hair. - Yes. Turn left. Hi, Mum! What letter? Yes? Are you serious? The state let me change my gender? I love you too! No... What did he say? Thank you so much! I can officially be Tobias Benjamin Tuza. I became a man in my country. - Good morning. - Good morning, I'm Eva Tuza. - Good morning. - Tobias Tuza. Nice to meet you. - Please follow me. - Which way? We should go around, then I'll show you the way. OK. You should know the potential risks of the physical changes. Not only the risks of the operation itself, but also other risks such as osteoporosis, heart problems, changes in the skin's elasticity and effects on the external genital organs. Oestrogen would protect you from these, but we'll lose that. So when making this decision, you have to take this into consideration, because you made an important decision: to live as a man. Depending on how much we follow this idea biologically, there are a number of risks. Sit down, make yourself comfortable. What I'm going to do, I'll tilt the backrest. Lean back and place your legs here. Nothing bad will happen. Put your legs on the sides. OK, thank you. Excellent, thank you. Everything is alright. Everything is alright here. We'll do an ultrasound, and that's it. OK? OK. Thank you. Size of the womb is: 50 x 33 x 40 millimetres. - Your cycle is normal, right? - Yes. Let's see the ovaries. This is on the right side. Here. OK, great. We're done. That was it. There's nothing to prevent you from having an operation later. Great, thanks for coming! Thank you! My assistant will give you the paperwork. It might take a few minutes. If you need help with anything else, we have other specialists. Thank you. - Thank you as well. - Goodbye! Thank you very much. Goodbye! Tobi, can you dress yourself? I mean, I'm 18... Mothers are like this, you know. I mean, you don't know yet. I'll never know what it's like... I meant when you become a father. When I start testosterone, I'm going to cry. First of all, you want the breast removal surgery, right? Yep. Don't be offended, but it sounds so weird to me. What? That you're really going to do this. I'm so afraid! I'm so worried about you. How did nature let this happen? You're a man trapped in a girl's body. Why do you have to correct it with surgery, with such a painful thing? If nature didn't make this mistake, there would be no need for such things. That's a good question. - Do you get what I'm saying? - Yes. It's nature, or God... You try to do everything to correct this mistake and people don't understand. And they even hurt you. That's why I'm so afraid... I don't want anyone to hurt you. Abel forgot which pocket to hit. Gay marriage had just been legalised in Ireland and we had a family lunch, very idyllic, they're Christian and everything, and this topic came up, and my dad said... It was me last time. So, my dad said, “I hope that a flood will take all those people to hell.” I was just sitting, trying not to cry while eating my soup. How many times have you heard someone talking about their kid's reaction? Rarely. Luckily. Dude! OK. So, Suzy is accepted... ...we don't talk about Marci. In my case, my whole family is supportive. Actually, the just don't give a s**t. They just don't give a s**t about my identity. If I went home one day like, “Look, I got tired of my legs, so I want to cut them off.” They would say, “OK.” It's not like they're supportive, they just forgot about my existence. I feel so bad that I'm such a lucky person! Don't feel bad about it! - We're happy for you! - You're extremely lucky! It's so unfair that others aren't as lucky as I am. - Can I ask you a question? - Yep. Will you use the men's toilets? - No. - Why not? I promised my mum I wouldn't, not until I start testosterone. To avoid arseholes? Yeah. She's reading too much on the internet. I feel so ashamed, I don't know much about this topic. Listen, it was the same for me. It started like, “Hi Mum, I'm bisexual”, but you're not. Wait. Then, “Hi Mum, I'm transgender.” Later, “Hi Mum, I'm pan-sexual.” Later, “Hi Mum, I'm gay.” Then, “Mum, I'm a pan-romantic gay.” And she was like, “Come on, you can be with anyone you like.” How cute! She was marching with us at Pride. Was that her reaction to everything? My Dad came as well! My heart is melting! Adorable! Get this: they ordered rainbow bow ties for the march. - You're torturing me! - I'm sorry. It's open, right? I thought it was open. It wasn't. OK? This rented place will be great for Tobi at first. Sure. Hold it. You pull it, until I get to the edge. - Are you set? - Hold on... This had come off too, great. - Can I do this part? - Yes, give it to me. - I can do it too! - Alright. This goes up, that one goes down. I'll screw that one and we can finish the shelves. If you earned 30 thousand euros, we'd be able to do so many things. - Like what? - In Gyulatanya... - Firstly-- - The house? It's not just the house, we need to fix our teeth first. - And we need new glasses. - Our teeth should be fixed. That includes dentures, implants... I'd get braces for the kids. We'd have a massage every month. We'd be able to buy cinema tickets, I'd love that. - We'd be up to date with films. - Why doesn't it close? I said films. But honey, how? You'll go to one theatre and I'll go to another? Alright, we'll schedule it. I won't watch any action films. We go to the cinema - you go to your film I'll go to mine. and then we'll eat somewhere together. Hm? He isn't sure about the surgery. It's a lot of money. I don't know how much or whether the state would pay for it or not. Maybe a part of it. I'm not sure. He has to find that out. It's his responsibility. How this goes. He's always saying that I'm too enthusiastic, so I'll let him do it. - Restrain yourself! - Alright, I will. If the blue towel is dry, put it in the hamper. OK. The cat was locked out of the house. Oh no. Did you see my makeup? I was shocked. - This is very hard, even for us. - Yes. There are typical male and female roles. I don't want you to change in one night. But... For a long time now, there have been things inside everyone's minds like a typical female look, a typical female job, a typical male look, a typical male job. - Many can't handle the change. - I know. For me, it's weird that you're a man and yet using makeup. Mum, everything is gender free. That's why I'm using the terms feminine and masculine instead of female and male. Nothing can be restricted to gender. Not hobbies, jobs or clothes. It doesn't matter what you're wearing. Whether you become a soldier and that it's Dad who cooks for us. It has nothing to do with gender. You'd give me a look if I were wearing skirts and a wig while washing the dishes. OK, but... I have no idea what to do. I didn't know what it was like not having to go to work. If I'd done my language exam, I would've been able to finally get my degree. Now, I only have a high school diploma on my CV. Now that I've lost my job... Don't worry! We can still do many things that don't require too much money and we can do on our own. The most important thing is to support Tobi during his first year in Budapest. We promised. We need to pay back Niki's student loan. We also promised that. Yeah. So, everything will stay the same around the house. Everything. Except for the things we can do by ourselves. The repairs, cutting the firewood. We can still do those things. To save some money after Tobi moves away, we can close our room in winter, so we only need to heat one room. We won't use the gas heating, only the fireplace. When you start taking hormones, I don't know how long it takes, so the first symptoms, or how should I say it... ...when your voice or your hair changes, will that be obvious at school? I don't care if it becomes obvious. I just don't want you to get into trouble. There won't be any problems! Are you sure? We can give you money for this starting from March, OK? - OK? - OK. I mean for your language exam and the physical changes. After the breast surgery, what else would you like to do? - I don't know. - How far would you like to go? I don't know. So, are you sure about the surgeries? I don't know. Do we have any sweets? Can you make something sweet? A pudding, maybe? Something we don't need for cakes. Let me check. That would be awesome. You told me you have anxiety again. You want to go back to the psychologist. It's not new, I've been having anxiety for a while now. A name is different... It can be reversed... - I don't want to change it back! - But you can't reverse surgery. When you told me about your anxiety and the idea of going to see the psychologist again... That's when I... ...and you told me not to ask you anything... Well, that just drove me insane. You kept asking me for ten minutes straight. That's when I felt that you had a problem... ...but didn't want to share it with me. You can tell me anything! I know. But I won't. It's also very hard to be open with the doctor. Usually, when I visit her, we talk... ...then I make a note of all the things I didn't dare tell her and the next time, I'll force myself to be braver and be more open. - I feel like shit. - Mentally? - Yes. - Really? Yes. Anxiety means fear, so are you afraid? What are you afraid of? That someone is going to hurt you? I don't know. Alright. It's quite hot. How many people went to Pride? Around 22,000 people. So, there is the rainbow. It represents LGBTQ people. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, I always forget what the Q means! I'll rinse this out. And then I will... ...prepare... We still have to make a fire. You, who's in front of me, who are you? What if you are gay too? Or the bus driver. Could he be gay too? So... How many gay people could be around us? We have no idea. That's when I realised, when I really understood his pain when he was crying. I just didn't know why he was crying. I asked him, “What's the matter?” He said, “Nothing.” “You know you can tell me anything.” And he said, “You know, Mum... it doesn't matter how many surgeries I have, ...I'll never be a real man.” I'm giving you three identical pens. From two different brands. - Signata is the better one. - I know. Buy your bus pass! The rest is pocket money. Buy some chocolate or a soda. Let's stay calm. I'm not nervous. I'm not nervous, I haven't even processed that my final exam is tomorrow. Thoughts are going to come to your mind very fast. That'd be nice because I've got nothing at the moment. You didn't read anything! Excuse me, do you want me to show you my folder again? You've been showing me that for a month. And? Did you read something or is it only nicely organised? I was reading them during my German classes. - OK, show me. - The teacher will scold me. Tobi, I can't believe you! What? Dad had no time to print! This: History. Dad had no time to print! Stop nagging me! Wait, Tobi, dear... Take care, break a leg. - OK. - I love you! I'm rooting for you and I'm praying for all of you. - Bye! - Bye, honey! - Call me! - OK. Oh! Be very proud of your graduation ribbon! Wear it with pride. Be the best, be the next role models! From now on, you should be aware of the fact that you're adults. Before I can feel total relief, I need to tell you something. Oh, God! Hi, cat! Tell us! OK, I'm gathering my strength! The main thing is that since my name and my gender were changed... Yes. I've accepted myself. I feel that I don't have to be very masculine because I don't need to idolise that masculinity because I don't have to explain to people why they should call me Tobi or Benji. For the first time, I feel I don't need testosterone. When I look in the mirror, I like what I see. It doesn't bother me that I don't have facial hair or a typical masculine look or a deep voice. I like the way I am. And I realised I can't really define my gender or my sexuality, so I'd like to live without any labels. Do you understand, honey? Do I have to understand? I just have to accept it. I don't want to have labels. When I realised I'm transgender, I felt that I was part of a community, and, as such, I had to meet certain expectations. It was subconscious, that's why I began to work out and wear men's clothes. That's why I started doing the whole thing. As I saw more of the world and all the open doors in front of me, I realised that I don't want to have any labels. They'd make me feel that I'd always have to meet expectations. I don't know what I am and maybe I never will, but I like living like this, so I thought I'd tell you. - What's the matter? - It's so difficult to explain this. I trust you so much, I love you so much, so that's why I wanted to tell you how I've been feeling lately. I wasn't sure about my feelings, so I didn't say anything to anyone. When I was talking with someone about it, I just said, “I'm thinking about it.” This is very hard for me, because... I accepted you as transgender, as a lesbian, we had so many things... I have absolutely no idea what this is. Do you understand me? - Yes. - I don't understand anything now. Please understand that when I ask about a friend, I have to ask about their gender assigned at birth. I just think like this. I don't judge anyone. But for me, my brain is... When you talk about pushing the boundaries... My brain is a heterosexual brain. You went from being my daughter to my son. My brain got used to that and now, I have to put you back in between the two. What you're telling me now, it's totally... I need time to process this. Alright. Alright. Alright. Well, alright. So, you said, non-... Non-binary. - What does it mean? - Neither a man nor a woman. - Is that an English expression? - Yes. And that includes... ...many more categories. It sounds ugly to me... ... I'd say 'genderless.' Are you genderless? F**k. Hello, Zia? Do you want me to squeeze it? It's fine. It's so nice. I forgot my gloves. Am I going to be all blue? - Yeah. - Will it come off? Maybe. Doesn't matter now. I can't believe that you grew up. - That's the sad truth. - And I don't know when it happened. We just went to work, took you to kindergarten, to school... I don't know. We should've stopped to think more often. That's how life goes on. I'm massaging it from the roots to make it all blue. I'm moving out, cat. That's right! I see you're already in tears... What's up? I just can't believe it... JAZMIN TUZA Tobi, come back and look around one more time! - Anything in here? - Nothing. Bathroom? - I've checked. Nothing. - Alright. Here are the bottles of champagne. - Do you want to take them? - Hell yes! - Really? - Give them to me! Do you have more alcohol in the house? Hold on... And this is... it's not alcohol-free. Honey, can Tobi take the champagne? Were you going to drink it? He can. I was, but take them. - We'll buy more. - You have palinka. Did you pack your other drinks? What drinks? - How should I know? - My vodka! Auntie Juliska! I'm moving out, I just want to say goodbye to you. - Take care! - You too! Alright? Goodbye, Gyulatanya! It was nice while it lasted. It was nice and good. More than enough. It was too much. Why are you dizzy? I'm very nervous. - Because of us? - No. - Then what is it? - Because of the job. Don't be nervous! I want to work there for a year. - So, you will! - Don't be nervous, you can do it! You shouldn't be nervous. I'm fed up! Please, help me stand up, this is as far as I can go. Will you be my wife? Crazy chick! Stand up! My non-binary child, I love you! Love you so much. I love you too, but I can't see a thing. The most important thing is to save money. Come on, Mum! Alright... - I'd rather hug Dad! - Come here, cockatoo! He never says such things. - Squeeze it! - I'm trying. Look, I'll help. - It's easier like this. - Here you go. Too light. But it could be just fine... - You did a great job! I like it. - Thank you. You can add some blush and the red lipstick makes her paler, you can leave it like this. I'll put it here. It can remove your makeup, and it'll leave an oily layer on the skin until you wash it off. Let it soak into your skin. This is awesome. Leave it on for a couple of minutes. Then you can wash it off. Make sure to rub it in well while you're washing it off. Because it's a face scrub as well. Wow, it's so cool! “Why are you so secretive about your relationship?” I said, “I never kept it a secret.” You can't know anything because I'm single. Wait, there is a lady in the back. Hold on, I'll do it. YOLO. So, YOLO! Hi! I'll make you some pea stew. OK. When I was at the hospital last month, everyone was talking about their lives. How they ended up there, about their family. And... They asked me, “How many children do you have?” I said, “Three.” “Boys, girls?” And I just froze. A bit of both. That's right! Do you see what I'm trying to say? I just froze completely. “Where are they living?” “In Budapest.” “Máté, Niki and the little one, too.” You can say my name. But I can't. Very weird. They were like, “Show us some pics!” And then I'm, you know... And I was like, “This is Tobias.” Well, OK. Are you sure you don't want any surgery? I'd like to buy another binder, because the one I have now is a bit loose, but otherwise, no. So, you won't have your breasts removed? No. That's such a relief. I'll tell your father that you don't want any surgery. Now, I feel as though... It's not that I'm just trying, I did manage to accept myself. Even when I have bad days, I know how to overcome them. Or I know when I can let myself feel sad. I found who I am, completely. Depression can come about because of your parents not being there. I was a bit angry with you, and with myself. And then I realised that you had no time to be with me and the reason that I felt that I was missing my parents, it was because you were always working to give us everything. So, there I was sitting with one of my colleagues, with a friend, who listened. And she just went like... She just smiled and said, “Isn't it interesting when, as an adult, you get to know your parents again?” I hope you know that we always tried to solve everything. I feel it. And others too. Many of my friends say... A lot of people keep telling me, a lot of my friends, they tell me, “You are so lucky to have such a great family and great parents.” Sometimes I just say, “Thanks, I know.” But sometimes I'm crying at home, and I come to realise that yes, I'm very lucky. We've been through hard times, but those times made our family stronger. It's so good that we're able to discuss this, to reflect on things. And so... If you think about this, a lot of families are not able to do that. I don't know if it is a matter of love or trust. But I... I love you so much, and I'm happy that I belong to this family. Another reason I could never leave this house. If I'd know where the files are. These are yours. I can't find them. Here they are. Look at them!
