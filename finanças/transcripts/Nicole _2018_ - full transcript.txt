As beautiful as you are, I don't think you'll ever have a problem getting laid. Now for brothers such as myself, it be a little more difficult. - Sound bitter about that. - No, just a little frustrating sometimes, that's all. - Yeah. Well it goes both ways. - Is that so?

Thank you. - Miss me? - We have to close out our tab. - Where are we going next? - Well I don't know about you but I'm pretty tired so I'm just gonna go home. - Well, I'd still like to at least make sure that you make it home safe. - How about we just finish these drinks first? - Well. Maybe we should get something to eat though. All this drinking. It's really gonna hurt you in the morning. - I actually was just gonna go home and make myself dinner so I'm good. - Okay. Well I'm sorry that I couldn't take us out to eat afterwards. - It's fine. - But if you don't mind, it'd be nice to get some good old fashioned home cooking. I can get it to go. - You want me to cook for you? - Yeah. - Okay. - I'll go ahead and call an Uber. All right. Let's get out of here. Yeah, that Uber should be here in like one minute. - Thank you for paying for that tab in there. I mean, I would've paid for it. It wasn't really a big deal. - It's no problem. - You wanna take a selfie? - Yeah. - Thanks. - No problem. Well. - I'll be right back. I'm gonna go change. - Okay. You sure you don't need my help with anything? - No, I'm good. - Nice place you got here. - Thanks. - No problem. You know, you really don't have to cook. Matter of fact, I've never had a woman make dinner for me on the first date. So what you making? - Spaghetti. That good? - That's cool, cool. Shit! Girl, this wine is terrific! - What's that? - Oh, I said the wine is good, it's good wine. That good wine. - Thanks. - You mind if I take a look around? - Yeah, just don't go into my bedroom. - So where do you get your artwork from? - Most of it's my work. - It's interesting. - So I should be done in like 15 minutes. Is that cool? - Cool. Take your time, take your time. Take as much time as you want. Shit, baby. This is fantastic. - Yeah? You like it? Thanks, I like to cook, it's fun. - Okay, well let me tell you something. You would make the perfect wife. - Yeah, I don't think we're quite there yet but I'll take the complement. You need to leave right after this, okay? Yeah. - Leave? Well, we just getting started here. - I don't wanna give you the wrong idea but I'm not hooking up with you tonight, John. - All right, all right. It's cool, it's whatever. But let me tell you something. You keep cooking like this and I ain't ever gonna leave. Facts. - You want some more wine? - Yeah, go ahead, top me off. - Stop. - My bad, go ahead. Top me off. - This is the last drink, okay? I'm serious. - All right. You got a restroom? - Excuse me, it's the second door on the left behind you. - Over here? - Yeah. - Okay. - Are you okay? Come here. Hey. Are you gonna be okay to get home? - Now why would you invite me over if you didn't plan for me to... - Okay, I already told you when we were in there. I'm not hooking up with you tonight. - You serious? - Yes, I'm serious. - What the fuck, yo? We went out and had a good time, had drinks that I bought. We come back to your place. You cook dinner. What the fuck else do you expect me to think? - I cooked dinner for you because you bought the drinks, you fucking asshole. I was being... Fucking! Fuck. - How's it going? - Just got some lights out. And I need to do some yard work so here I am. - You know it's midnight, right? - Sorry. They're prescription. - Oh, I'm sorry, that was rude. Now I'm supposed to ask if you have one of our credit cards and if you'd like to save 10% on today's purchase? - No thanks. - Looks like you're heading to my kind of party. All you need now is a chainsaw. - The noise might wake the neighbors. - You bet it would. Five bricks. - Oh yeah, sorry. Thank you. The lights. - Have a good night. - You're ruining my place, you asshole. And you're a fucking cop. Didn't dig too deep, did you, Nicole? That's what I get for dating online. Oh my god. - Boo. The hell, girl? You ain't done yet? Girl, I'm talking to you. - No, you're dead. Okay, I killed you. - Killed me? You chopped off my hands and my feet. I should've made you pay for them drinks. Yo, come on, come on, come on, come, come, come. You don't wanna do this. You don't wanna get the place dirty. Don't wanna make a mess. And your cooking, dinner, dinner was good. Dinner was good. Just stop, come on, come on. Put it down. - Why'd you have to attack me? - Yeah. That was a dick move. Was drunk and horny a good enough answer? Yo, it was nothing personal. - Raping me wasn't personal? - Yo, what's the big deal? I thought you were feeling me. Baby, baby, come on, come on. All right, all right now, damn it. You know I'm a cop. Like COPS. Like what you gonna do when they come for you? - You know what? You got what you deserved. - Getting chopped up? - Yeah, you were way too heavy in one piece. - First and foremost, I resent that remark. Second of all, just so you know, I lost 10 pounds before our Tinder date, ma'am. - Sir, more like 25 but who's counting? - Yeah, you're right. - Yeah, that's funny. - Well. The least you could do is get me something to drink. - Are you serious right now? - Yeah. Besides, I know you got some alcohol in here 'cause don't nobody drink as much as you. You can really put 'em down, girl. I mean, what are you, like full time alcoholic or something? So you going to get the drink? Okay, go get me a drink. Well, shit. Oh, she chopped me up good. How the fuck am I gonna get away? Oh shit. Baby. Aren't you such a good helper? Ladies first. - Really? - Well help a brother out, shit. Fuck, that's good. - Yeah, I don't buy cheap wine. - Well I have to get the name of that non-cheap wine. - Want some more? First, question. Have you attacked women before or am I your first? - Attacked? Baby, I'm just trying to get a little well-deserved action. Okay? - What? - Yo, I spent over 100 dollars last night. You telling me you didn't wanna get laid? - Okay, so what's your family like? Do you have any brothers or sisters? - Don't you think it's a little too late to be asking about my family? - Answer the damn question. - Yes. I have a sis, well, I had a sister. - So would you like if your sister was drugged and raped? Or what about your mother? What if this happened to her? - Actually, to be honest with you, they'd be straight. They can pay for themselves. - Fucking asshole. You know what? I'm glad I killed you. - You know what? That makes one of us. Now, can you get me some more of that good ass wine? So what's your plan? People saw us out together last night. The Uber driver dropped us off here. My DNA's all over your house. Not the way I'd hoped. - Easy. After the Uber dropped us off, you left. - That's your plan? Baby. They're gonna come searching for you. I'm a cop. They're going to find you. Then they gonna take your pretty little ass to jail. - You know what? - What? - It's better than where you're going. - Well. You cut it off. Wasn't too clean though. You should watch a little more Game of Thrones, less Sex And The City, though, huh? So Nicole. Can I ask you something? Is this turning you on? Baby, baby. Baby, I just want you to think about this, okay? - Maybe this is turning me on. - Baby, just take a little, take a minute. Let's pray, let's pray, come on, let's pray. - Hey, what's up, Nicole? Nicole, you all right? Hey. What's going on? - Hey. - Ah, wine for breakfast, huh? That little hair of the dog? Well I just wanted to say what's up. You know, if you ever need anything, you know, I'm right next door. - Yeah. I'll talk to you later. - Oh yeah, yeah, no problem. I just wanna say what's up. If you wanna get up later tonight, though, I'm having some people over to watch the game so, you know, feel free to come by or... - Hey, it's hot as hell in here! And I'm scared of the dark. Stinks, smells like something crawled up here and died. Oh, that's me. For real though, let me out. - You're still talking. - Nicole, Nicole! - That's what you get, you Harvey Weinstein motherfucker. - Hey, you need some help? - Nope, I'm... - No, no, girl, don't be silly. I got this. Good thing I workout, am I right? Am I right, am I Mr. Right? Girl, what you got in here? 'Cause this thing is like... - You know what I was thinking? Maybe we should go out sometime, yeah? - Yeah, so what's up? You trying to like... - Wednesday. - Wednesday, Wednesday, yeah, Wednesday. Most definitely, yeah. - All right. - I can't wait. Girl. Wednesday. - All right, I'll see you then? - See you then. I'm talking about, Gare Bear! Yeah! - Hey Nicole. I brought you a coffee. How was your weekend? How'd your date go? - It was no big deal but anyway, I wanna hear about your gig. I'm sorry I couldn't make it. I'm pretty sure it was much more fun than what I did. - Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Gig was good. We played for a whole like 10 people but they seemed to dig it. - Cool. So I was thinking that maybe we could get together soon? Sound good? - Yeah, that sounds great. - Yeah. How about tonight? We could go out for some drinks or something. - Cool, yeah, let's do it. - Cool. All right, well I'm gonna get back to work but I'll see you later on today. - Okay. - Hey, hey, hey. How y'all doing? So, I hope everything goes well with your client today, okay? Good?
