"APPOINTMENT WITH THE DEVIL" Nineteen centuries after the end of Pompeii, a Polish geologist, Baron Haroun Tazieff, decides to explore the treacherous world of volcanoes. A long journey was announced, since the earth is dotted with dead cities under the lava. However, Tazieff needed a companion, the painter Pierre Bichet. A man who until then had considered nature more of a friend than an opponent. The painting? He'll finish it when he gets back. But he didn't know one thing, it would take two years. The descent into a crater always begins with an ascent, one that never ends... Our schedule was ambitious. Begin our world tour with that journey to the center of the earth that has been making men dream ever since Julius Verne opened the doors of the universe to them. Precisely, it was a door we were looking for. And the Etna is among the few places on earth that has a suitable one. It is a rare case for a crater to remain open after an eruption. Generally, the lava solidifies and plugs the funnel. Speleology, or the study of caves, consist of prudence, materials and technique. Prudence is learned. Word of honor. We had checked the material before, starting from the basic principle that a silk stocking holds, until it holds the weakest of its stitches. And a snapping rope, well... Is worse than a mismatched sock. Only technique cannot be improvised. A tool that at first seems simple and practical can reserve the worst of betrayals. To give you an example, this is how a rope ladder can push an honest painter to the verge of blasphemy. Mankind will one day go to the moon, to Mars, maybe further away, but... To the center of the earth, never! Speleologist depth records will always be a laughing matter compared to the radius of the globe. Professor Tazieff will explain why: Under the thin crust of the earth's surface, the enormous mass of magma spreads out. What is magma? It is a sea of ​​melting rock at a temperature that probably exceeds 2000 degrees and reaches a depth of up to 2900 km. Magma surrounds the central core of the earth, mysterious, unknown, always hot but much less so. Very slow currents circulate in the magma, pushing it in every direction at a rate calculated at one, two, up to ten centimeters a year. In our scheme the velocities of the magma appear exaggerated by several million times. But, due to the extraordinary viscosity of the incandescent rock, the currents develop uncontainable gases of such strength that the earth's shell, no thicker than 50 kilometers, becomes fractured sometimes, like a skull. And in those cracks, one here, one there, according to different geological ages, magma is injected. Quickly, it crosses over the crust, and springs to the surface. Thus, a volcano is formed. A volcano, in principle, is just a hole from which those gases eject pushing the magma out, which from then on takes the name of lava. The mountain develops later, around the crater hole. As the flows solidify, the ash, the pyroclastic bombs and fragments of every size accumulate around the area, pushed out by the unstoppable impulse of the gases. Nowadays there is nothing left to discover, we know about the fissures of the earth's crust, the volcanoes, which line up in a chain, from the Pacific to the Sunda archipelago. From the Antilles, to the sprawling Atlantic, to the heart of Africa, up to the center of the Mediterranean. The links of this chain were the stages of our "appointments with the devil." Japan came first. A land born of volcanic labor and which, since inception, has practically never known what it is to live in peace. The Fusiyama, the sacred mountain. We greeted it from afar. It was too calm for us. It has been dormant for 250 years and, mind you, with only one eye. After all, 250 years is nothing for a science like geology, which counts earth's days by millenia. But waiting for our visit was an insomniac volcano, the Sakurajima. Volcanoes always dress dark. Their mineral world rejects life. And here there was not a single tree, nor a living being. At the beginning of the ascent, the ground at the foot of the mountain crumbled under each step. Then, we arrived to the rim of the crater. All around us was silence. A sly and abnormal calmness. Moments later, it was the end of the world. We had studied it, the Sakurajima, and noted that its eruptions were always directed towards the North. To the south of the crater, we were sheltered from it, relatively... since the enormous cauliflower cloud carried stones of all sizes. Thousands of tons of rock, a persistent rain, to the point of looking like a slow motion recording. In reality, the fountain of stones flows at fifty meters per second, and rises to thousands of meters. Before us, no one had seen that fabulous sight up close. Nobody. Except those who died from it... At the foot of that hell was a village of earthly paradise. But its existence is pure chance, a whim. Twice already, huge lava flows have surrounded it, cutting it off, but without touching the village, as if by a miracle. After the last storm, those villagers, men and women, shoveled the solidified lava to trace a road, to reconnect them to the world. A leap of faith... Because there is no certainty that they will finish that job. Sooner or later, without remedy, their village will disappear. Like many others, from the convulsions of an apocalypse. When? Tomorrow... In the volcanic calendar, it could be in a year or in a century. But one thing is certain... The village will be suffocated. No one can guarantee that these crops will be collected. Will death mow them down, as it did to these people? Or will life continue? The future is on the palm of the gods. And here there is no god more terrible than the volcano. Maybe this is the door we were looking for on the Etna, instead it leads into the side of a sacred mountain, the Aso-san. Together with the Fusiyama, it is one of the shrines of the Shintoist faith. The volcano is more than a church for these pilgrims. It is the house of the living God. And the roar of its voice has crossed centuries of history up until to them. Today, pilgrims look for the source of its legends on the edge of the crater. The roots of the past are down there, with the keys that open the doors of the future. In June 1958, the volcano extended its last hecatomb. Victims sacrificed to a choleric and sudden eruption. We thought about this as we walked down to the bottom of the funnel. However, the volcano warns those who understand its language. It's like the sea, you just need to understand it. Everything has a meaning, the silence, a crackle, a breath, a smell. Crowded on the edge of the sanctuary, the pilgrims watched us descend. For the first time, they saw men disappear among those sulfur vapors which literally eat metals apart. They paralyze the cameras, wear out the steel rungs of the ladders. Then, the smoke covered the landscape. We had time to catch a glimpse of a jade-colored lake at the bottom. Calm and hypocritical. From lake to lake, 4,000 kilometers apart, the distance between Japan and the Philippines. This pond is the crater of the Taal. The volcano that forty years ago killed two thousand people and turned thousands of fertile fields into desert. Under the harmless-looking blue waters, threat lurks. Under those whirlpools, volcanic springs escaping from the bowels of the earth. Philippine vulcanologist are always on the alert. They listen to the mountain's movements, they feel the pulse of the colossus. Their long patience will perhaps avoid immense tragedies such as the one that devastated the Sunda archipelago. In the last century, between Java and Sumatra, the Krakatau stood, as big as Rome, eight hundred meters high. In 1883, it was pulverized by an eruption that left nothing behind, making the masts of the anchored vessels at Valparaiso tremble, twenty thousand kilometers away. The toll, 40,000 dead. Forty-four years later, in 1927, an islet emerged in the middle of the Sunda Strait. The natives baptized it "the son of the Krakatau". The volcano winked a fiery eye from the center of the new crater, equal to that of its father. It's amazing how one can get used to even the worst of cases. In Java for example, the crater of the Kelut contained around 40 million cubic meters of sulphurous water. With each eruption, the surrounding villages in a radius of forty kilometers were flooded by torrents of boiling mud. Under a hellish shower. We wanted to explore the Bromo. The mountain was belching because its volcano is almost always active. The Bromo is also a sanctuary, and in its crater, people sacrifice many animals every year. We wanted to win more than anything, no one before us had managed to get down into the Bromo boiler. It didn't take long to figure out why. There was not an edge, a rock, a hold, impalpable ash everywhere that at the slightest jolt could precipitate in an avalanche. A choice had to be made between suicide and abandonment. But, a month later, we returned. Meanwhile it had rained as it rains in the tropics, a deluge, which, however, held the volcanic dust down and decreased the risks. It will be hard to forget the 250m descent into the funnel. One misstep, and goodbye. Disappearing into the boiling gases. What did we feel? Well, vanity. Since the world began, it was the first time that anyone had managed to look down the throat of that beast along with its foul breath. On the other hand, it's curious how disaster and prosperity go hand in hand. The eruption flattens the ground, covering everything. But, at the same time, volcanic dust acts as an amazing fertilizer. Of course, this fertilizer costs its price in human lives. The country, on the other hand, is the most populated in the world. 600 inhabitants for each square kilometer, against 154 in Italy. Dedicating their alternating fortunes to heaven, the peasants perform not only a kind rite. We mean that nothing can win over their patience. Not even hellfire. On the average, every ten years the fields are choked, but the stubborn farmer knows how to wait for the return of good fortune. Hope gives him the strength to make the same gestures every day, because, whoever isn't afraid to live down here, isn't even afraid to die. Still in Java, we met with another great assassin. The Merapi, god of fire, which slays with almost seasonal regularity. In it's crater a dome swells slowly, A bubble, a monstrous abscess, when the thrust of the gases reaches a critical point, the dome explodes. Lava is blown twenty kilometers away. This time, it was joy we felt. The perverse but profound joy of finding ourselves where no one has ventured. The first impression is modest. But under our soles, separated by a few centimeters of hard stone, one clearly perceives that magma is in motion, deaf, burning, continuously. On average, the abscess bursts every five years Sometimes, without doing too much damage, other times deadly. 1000 years ago, a cataclysm buried the shrine of Borobudur, the foot of Merapi. As soon as the temple walls were cleared of the ashes, the small sacred dancers returned to learn steps and figures that make their dance a prayer. A tradition that has never been lost, an art that has never been interrupted. Once again, desolation and fertility become twins. It is the law of the volcanic lands which we were able to verify with mathematical accuracy at almost every stop on our itinerary. Sometimes that identification became so absolute that one could think it was a reflected mirage from thousands of miles away. You can fall asleep in Java on top of a pile of coffee at the foot of a volcano, and wake up at the foot of a volcano on a pile of coffee. But, beware. In between is the Pacific Ocean, rub your eyes, you no longer see the Merapi. But the Santiaguito, in Central America. And the Javanese? Not here. Santos Indians in their place. Busy with their coffee harvest. As soon as they get paid, they disappear. They return home to some remote village between Mexico and Guatemala. We don't even know if they will get there. After all, in a country like this, no questions are asked. You take life as it comes. And the weather, as God commands. It is clear that we liked the Santiaguito. The trouble was that it didn't like us back. Some volcanoes can be approached by car like wild beasts in African reserves. But the Santiaguito was evidently an enemy of tourism. Two rainy days in the bush, three steps forward and two steps back. Slashing your way through life is not a saying in Guatemala. But we didn't exploit it, and the Santiaguito was left to his solitude. We were in a hurry to get a rematch. Besides, we were within range of the Popocatepetl. The 5500m giant that dominates the central plateau of Mexico. Water, water, fire, fire. You seek fire, and you find water. This has been happening ever since the craters of volcanoes change into lakes. But the fire is not far away. The waters are green from the sulphur. Red from the iron oxides. The fishermen who brave against these extravagant waves, know, moreover, that they are playing with fire. Death often lurks under the flat bottom of their pirogues. But we are in Mexico, where death is the companion of life. Let us observe for example the celebration of the dead of Janitzio, which begins on All Saints Day. On the hill beside the Patzcuaro lake, the women look for the graves of their loved ones, which have been covered by dust throughout the past year. At sunset the candles are lit, and each one is a prayer dedicated to a soul. In San Salvador the Izalco awaited us, the youngest active volcano in the world. In active duty. They call it the lighthouse of the Pacific Ocean because at night, its fireworks guide the boats off the coast. In 1770 this farmer's great grandfather was plowing his field he heard a formidable roar, and it was the Izalco preparing to emerge. It took less than two hundred years to grow two thousand meters. We paid court to it, a discreet courtship, for a good week. Every day, it woke up almost always at the same time. And so, we calculated that between each eruption we could reach the top. But the people of San Salvador kept telling us that it was impossible. Well, yes. As confident we as were in the accuracy of our calculations fear always accompanied us, faithful as our own shadow. Tazieff moves on forward, dangerously forward. He doesn't even turn around to signal us. Ten meters from the entrance, his thick rubber soles begin to burn up. Forcing him to give up. Just in time, we had miscalculated. Like dead weight, we throw ourselves down the slope without waiting for the effects of that unexpected awakening. When we go back for a moment to turn around, fear... A minute ago we were on the exact spot where the pillar of fire originated. After that experience, the flight across the Andes seemed like a kid's joke. Here is the central mountain range, with its gathering of volcanoes. Of all those peaks, we chose the highest, the Tupungato with 6700 meters. Next to it, the Mont Blanc would look like a dwarf. The valley of the Tupungato is as long as half of the Po valley, but, much more inconvenient to cross. Yes, it was a gate, indeed. Even here, at the end of the world, we were about to enter someone's house. The amazing thing, however, is that the entire valley belongs to a single owner. But once we got on the other side, what a change of sight. It was like entering another dimension. Once we reached a certain age, and a certain weight, the air of adventure is like that of the high mountain, it's difficult to breathe. Now, we had reached both. But the sweat of the forced marches was like a bath of youth. These limestone pools are called gour, they are most easily encountered in underground caves but, who doesn't know? Nature has its quirks. Finally we arrive, dying of thirst, we could've drank an ocean. One day, the shepherds appeared. They seemed like Martians to us. They accompanied us for a short time before disappearing, very briefly. The pleasure of encounters is intense in the desert. But just as fast. How long had we been on the march? To find out, we should have consulted the calendar. Day after day, we repeated the same gestures. We forgot about the volcano. And every morning it was necessary to recover the mules that had also acquired a taste for freedom. Before feeding them, you had to blindfold them with a hood. With every step you believed you've arrived, but there was one more stage. Always, one more stage, no end in sight. We moved at the same speed as the herds of llamas who carried their packs from Argentina to Chile passing through the Andes. This system is cheaper than the railway, but a quarter of the animals do not arrive at their destination. It was impossible to take the wrong way, we just had to follow one carcass to the other, the dry mountain air had mummified more than one. The book of nature is not always nice to read, here it said "woe to the weak". There are moments, however, in which nature is in a state of grace. Like now, at 4000 meters, after so much arid desert. Before us, the most unpredictable and tender oasis opening up like a Japanese album, under the door of the world. The beasts of burden accompanied us up to 5000 meters, it was the muleteer who said: "Another one that will never wake up again." The following day the carriers left us overcome by altitude sickness, the soroche, But, how idyllic our little camp was out in the sun. Yet, the evening before, we didn't leave our tents because of a storm. The shelter had to be set up for the first night. "Let's build ourselves an igloo," Tazieff said. The Eskimo igloo is a fortress against the wind and the cold. The discouragement that, in the mountain, is the beginning of the end. It would be a good rule, for those who challenge the mountains, to bring along a saw and a snow shovel. Sometimes, it's a matter of life or death. One must know how to build an igloo, having learned beforehand. First, you build up a wall in a spiral, tilting the blocks more and more towards the center. And finally, the architrave or keystone, which closes up the dome. There you have it, the chick can hatch out of the egg with its own beak. Now the wind can howl, the cold can show its teeth. It's comfortable here, at home, you'd say it's even hot. Safe. Outside it's thirty below zero, inside it's fifteen above. There's running water, and the luxury of silence, compact as stone. The next day we left our castle. Someone else turned back, since not everyone manages to live at 6000 meters. The fumes from the secondary crater were a false alarm. The actual volcano was much higher up. When one really believes a limit is reached, you grit your teeth and say: "Five more minutes, one more and then I'll stop." It's like playing around with your cards in solitaire. The crater began where the glacier ended. The giant sleeps, warmly, and the snow melts on his blanket. In the empty sky of great heights, in the silence thick as a wall, a temporary equilibrium had been established between the frozen earth and the underground fire. We are at 6700 meters. If a volcano is silent, it does not mean that it's dead. The best example in this case is the African twin of the Tupungato. The Kilimanjaro. Geography separates them but analogy unites them. History says nothing about the eruptions of Kilimanjaro, but the history we know of this volcano is as short as a man's memory. On a geological scale, less than a second. Now let's imagine a 450-metre column made up of sheets of paper, one and a half times the height of the Eiffel Tower. Each sheet represents 1000 years, indicating the age of the earth, 4 and a half billion. The thickness of that bookcover represents the Christian era. The Kilimanjaro is not dead and one day we will realize it. Waiting under the herds of clouds that caress the giant's sides, the terrain of one of the most beautiful countries in the world, Tanganyka. Down in the savannahs roamed nomadic tribes of men, out of history. Nothing has changed since the Stone Age. Indifferent to the trials of the century, these ancient shepherds carry their own world with them. Their problems, and their flies. They go from trough to trough, from well to well. From water to water... Of course, the water is not always drinkable. Most ponds and lakes are saturated with mineral salts. From the plane, Lake Natron. It looks like the folded skin of a giraffe. The most active volcano in this part of Africa is the Langai. But its eruptions are brief, bursting as long as a short walk We try. A short approach march... And nothing happens. At the bottom of the crater there is nothing but a cap of solidified lava, which looks just like a bottle of champagne, ready to pop. But when? In the west, in the Congo, two volcanoes side by side, whose alternate roars imitate the voices of a monstrous musical duo. The first is the Nyamulagira, whose sides are covered by small parasitic volcanoes. The other is the Nyiragongo, with a reputation for being one of the strangest volcanoes in the world. Its crater, with a perfect shape of three kilometers in circumference, had a reputation for being inaccessible until the day when, modestly, we managed to climb its rocky, coconut-like wall. But, it was definitely worth it. At the end of a steep drop of two hundred meters we are face to face with a sight that is more baffling than incredible. At the bottom of the funnel, a lake bigger than St. Peter's square, boiling. It was lava. Molten lava. That infernal window has been cooking in the cauldron for thirty years. From time to time, the wave of fire ripples and hits the walls as if pushed by a heavy surf. We stayed for a long time, bent over the edge of the abyss without being able to take our eyes off that fiery pond breathing slowly as if revealing the presence of a dark power. All around the red lake, and as if to emphasize its size, small craters spewed jets of steam and pestilent puffs of smoke. These are the times that nature inspires terror. But, however numerous, terrestrial volcanoes are small in relation to the number of submerged volcanoes. Thousands, even. Most will never see the light of day. Others barely emerge, scratching the surface of the waters.
