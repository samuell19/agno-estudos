And you'll be thrown out of here. Providence won't allow that to happen, my dear Krall. It will provide us with weapons. Allow me, General, to be somewhat cautious. You? always the same. A glass of milk, my dear Krall? Is that an insult? I haven't got any whisky. - It doesn't matter. I'm going down to the wine cellar. There it is! I've got all the weapons you need. Where? A hundred miles from here. I've got enough to provide 20,000 soldiers with guns and ammunition. I've got enough to provide 20,000 soldiers with guns and ammunition. You're that rich? Yes, why wouldn't I be? I was told you were flat broke. It's a rumor spread by my competitors. The rumor also says you're a drinker, a woman chaser and a gambler. Vile prate. No more. Where there's smoke, there's fire. And neither is there fire without cannons. Nor cannons without money. I've got the money. I can get you machine guns, rifles, ammo. Hand grenades. I'm not sure about TNT. How much? How much? 900,000 dollars. 600. - What? 600! You think I'm going to risk my life and my freedom for so little. That's ridiculous! All right. I want 150,000 right now. And the rest... . cash on delivery. No, my dear Krall. - What do you mean : no? Macao is the city of gambling and women, is it not? Some sort of huge gambling house...

So, I've decided never to pay anything in advance. Nothing? When I say "nothing" I mean 20,0003. It's impossible! It's too little! I can't do better, my dear Krall. Can you repeat? What are you saying? Why did you leave the lnternational Concession? Well... you know... The International Concession has become a life imprisonment Concession. I heard you have been working for the enemy. I did? You're kidding! If I worked for them I wouldn't be flat broke! No, Sir. I'm a professional dancer. You are? - I swear. I was at the Canton Coliseum. In the show. I did the ruby and camellia. The ruby and camellia? It was you? - Yes. You were gorgeous. It does not say what you were doing in town. Well... Excuse me!

A battleship? No... I've got my yacht. You've got a yacht, all to yourself? To myself. What is it called? Amouna. It's a pretty name. And do you think you could give me a lift to Marseilles? No. Not In Marseilles. I'll be going to Macao. And would you wish to come, I'd take you there. We'll be there in 2 days' time. Macao In China is somewhat like Monte Carlo at home?. . Exactly.

A bath, a shower... Flowers. Orchids! As if I were a star! It's funny... Looks like you were expecting me! You always expect the woman you meet. And I didn't delay you? You came just at the right time. Some time earlier, some time later and... it was over! Let's not think of that! I wouldn't have had the pleasure of meeting you. And who told you it will be a pleasure? I did. See you in a little while. Come in! No way to leave port. The crew won't. A mutiny! - Almost! You smell garlic! Mint? Now, commander, ls no time for jokes! It is serious this time... Yes... But I don't like that garlic smell... Right... But the crew don't like working for nothing. They haven't been paid for 2 months. Fire those who are discontent. As simple as that. No one ls happy. I'd have to get rid of the whole crew. Who cares? I'll hire others. With what money? What money? I've just had my biggest ammunition order ever. General Lin-Tse. Half a million. Dollars! Dollars! - 80?... Dollars! Dollars! - 80?... And we start loading, the men will get double pay.

I hope you'll have nice dreams. What are looking at? The seagulls... I love seagulls. Don't you? - Do I? I can't see any seagulls. Why don't you go and pack up, Miss Marguenon? Is it an order? Only a piece of advice. We're almost there. Come with me, then. I've already packed my luggage, Miss. She won't leave you one minute! - Poor woman! Dad sent her 300 $ worth of cables To recommend her not to leave me until we got to Macao. Your dad's nice? He is a banker! - He's got a golden heart! Of course! I haven't seen him for 2 years.

They're racketeers... Good day, Father. I'm sorry I kept you waiting. Mr Lin Chai... For us, waiting is praying. Here It ls. For the poor. - How can I thank you? You mustn't thank Yin Chai. Yin Chat thanks you. See you soon. Girls! Your legs! Here it is boss! The "Surya" had not paid their fees. So we paid ourselves. With a bonus. All right. Next time, he'll understand! The fisheries are reluctant too... Sink 2 or 3 of their boats... and close down the fisheries. We've delivered the scrap Iron for the Fen Yang junks. No problem. What about the water? - We control all drinking water. We ration it. Don't worry! Gambling? Baccarat brought In 200,000 S last night. Fan Tan? - 100,000 Perfect! Fan Tan? - Let's go! Play number 3 - Number 3? Why? The 3 will win. I'm quite sure. As 1 plus 1 make 3. All right. Let's play number 3. Put it in here. Three dollars going down, right? What are you saying? Nothing. I pray for It to multiply. Number 3 wins. I knew you were lucky : like white glass, 4-leaf clover Right... I'll keep you as my good luck charm. Fifty dollars. Wait... I'm still playing! To have results, you must bum incense to the High and Mighty. And what about the lucky charm? You just need to grease his palm. Have this! And don't gamble! Quite funny, this! Feels like you're catching crawfish! Excellency! I'm not worthy of tying your shoe laces. How much? Oh... In a while, Excellency! If you like the Information or rather... the indiscretion. I damn myself for your sake, Excellency! Talk now! For you, I'm going to betray my friend colonel Yasuda. He's worried. - Why? He got a call yesterday warning him of Krall's arrival in Macao. Krall? - Yes... Krall. News aren't good, are they? He can pay? Who knows? Sometimes he's as wealthy as you, Excellency, sometimes almost as poor as Almaido. Don't worry! No money, no guns! You'll know all about it, Excellency! Are you interested in this? Whatever happens, Almaido remains the same. Fifty dollars! Thank you, Excellency! Up there? There's a guy who wins too much at Fan-tan. Over 10,000 i. At fan tan? The foreigner In a white jacket. Can you see him? Good news coming! Oh, lucky guy! Winning again? Enough for a nice dinner! Shall we get it back? Yes... As usual! There's a guy over there in the water! You're seeing things! Must be a shark! A talking shark! Get hold of the gaff! Go tell the commander to slow down. What have you got? I lost again. I've already lost my castle in Touraine, my Cannes villa and my limousine. I'll gamble my diamond necklace. No... I can't accept! You can! - Not your diamonds, no. Give me a chance to win my losses back. There you are. You lost! If It had not been for fun, I'm sure I would have won. Maybe... Tonight in Macao... you'll have the opportunity to gamble seriously. Is that true? - Yes. Tell me... I think I'll be indiscreet. What job do you do? Me? - Yes. Nothing... I'm very wealthy. Especially since I took everything you owned. Come in! Sir! - Yes? We've just fished out a drowned man. A drowned man? Put him back to sea. But he's alive! All the more reason... - Don't do that. - No? No... - Excuse me. Where ls he? - Soaking on deck. Dear Krall. Imagine meeting you here! Great! You go bathing at night? Among the sharks. Preparing an article? A trivial piece of news. I'll tell you about it. Assault, armed robbery. You might not believe it, but I'm broke. Allow me... My friend, Pierre Meunier, from the Havas press agency. Miss Mireille. - Glad to meet you. The drowned man? But you're wounded... - No it's nothing. I'm intruding. Don't be silly! Come, you'll catch cold. Things are not good, Sir. The crew is still angry. If they're not paid tomorrow, they'll take it badly. They will be paid. No doubt. - I hope so. I'd like to see Mr Werner Krall. The skipper is ashore. I'd like to see Mr Werner Krall. The skipper is ashore. What a pity! I could have been much help to him. No one is allowed on board. Now, now. Why? - Because it's forbidden. Let him come on board. He might be bringing dough. You shut up! You're expecting some money? Mr. Krall is a generous man, isn't he? Indeed, he is! That's enough. Get on shore. Why get angry? Every one needs money, right? I need money too... Get off the boat! Do go to bed, Miss. Excuse me... I'm exhausted. She's exhausted! Finished? - I really wanted to be with you. Is it true that we shall leave Macao? It's true. - Where shall we go? I don't know. - Far from China? To Europe? May be. I know. Let's go to France. To France? Why? It was mum's country. And... And? Dad... look at me... What? - Tell me... Can't you see it? I thought you'd guess. He's nice, you know... - Who? He's very nice. Tall, sporty, handsome... - French? He is a great journalist. In love? And I'm 18. Can you believe it? Where ls he? - Here. In Macao. I hope I'll like him. - I'm sure of it. You give me everything without my asking for anything. You want... that journalist? - Don't make me ask you. You're asked on the phone, Sir. Oh... he's there? Right! I'm coming. Here's 15,000 S I'm scared - Scared of what? Scared of losing. That's wonderful! In that case, you're sure to win. 100 at the bank. Any one says "banco"?

How much? 500,000 dollars. It's a deal! And... you pay? 20,000 at first delivery... and... - No! Why "no"? Listen to me, Excellency... I have no trick up my sleeve. I'd rather see the money first. But I'll give you... - Give me everything. At once. Otherwise... But It's Impossible, Excellency. No one can pay everything in advance. This is not the way things are done. This is the way I do things. And what's your last word? Cash! Thank you. And... see you soon. Excellency... I have no doubt. Look! - How much? 45,000. - 45 thousand! Yes! Shall we go? - ' Course not.

Better and better. - You will come? What? And there will be some caviar, bird's nest soup... Better and better. - You will come? You take everything for granted, do you? You're funny, aren't you? - Here. Tomorrow. - I'll wait for you. - Can I go now? About tomorrow's supper... If I am not there yet at midnight, eat without me. I'll wait for you... If you see me here tomorrow, it'll mean I'm sleepwalking. $25,000. Banker! Eight. Nine. The bank wins. Pay the gentleman. I'll write you a Banco!. Changer! - Coming. Have $25,000 fall down. - $25,000. Phone early morning at the Barclays' Bank, Hong Kong. Come and see Macao's curiosities. I'm a lucky charm. Really lucky. A small shark! A small shark! You're making a mistake. I didn't do anything. The others did. I swear. What's wrong with your eye? - Who did it? Who did it? It's the Eldorado. - The Eldorado? Yes, It's the owner... - What? The Eldorado owner? - 50 dollars! - 50 dollars! Mr. Milley. Hello. - Hello, Pierre. What's wrong with you? I'm scared. - Scared? Scared of what? - Of the dragon. Of the dragon? You mean Miss Marguenon... She's out. Dad will be glad to meet you. Shall we kiss? Why not? Pierre Milley. Havas Press agency. What do you think? Nice. Isn't he? This ls my father. What do you think of him? Pleased to meet you, Sir. So am I, Mr. Milley. Say something. Why don't you? How do you like Macao, Sir? Yes... No... It depends. He is somewhat ill-bred. Excuse him, dad. When you think that on my first night in Macao I was thrown at sea. What? - Really? - Yes. - Shall we? I had won too much money at the Eldorado casino where my story was taking me. And it is forbidden. Gambling? - No, winning. But they've got a great trick. The poor lucky guy ls followed, put on a boat, dispossessed and thrown out to the sharks. To teach him how to lose. And do you know who organizes this surprise-party, if I may say so... Sit down. Thank you. The Eldorado manager himself. - It's a shame. Is this man's name known? Do you know him, sir? - I? - I told you he was ill-bred. Anyway... Powerful or not, I swear I'll find him. And I'll take him down. Take him down? - Yes, I'll have him thrown in jail. Bravo! He's wonderful, isn't he? He's nice. A cable for you, Sir! Demand delivery of weapons tomorrow night. Later, useless. Excuse me. I was feeling lonely. I wanted to see someone. Talk a little. - Thank you. And I'm only someone. No… - I understand. You know... Some days you feel blue. Yes... I know that too. But I'm less lucky than you are. I've always been my only friend. And you still are? Yes... Why don't you trust me? I feel I could understand. Who knows? I might even be able to help you. Why would you? Didn't you get me out of this mess I was in in Canton? What a mess! It was only selfishness on my part. No more. I can be selfish too. Tell me... You won't tell me? What? - Tell me about your trouble. How do you know I'm in trouble? Easy. Take this, for example. You didn't carry this yesterday. Your false joy doesn't hide anything. And those boats surrounding us since morning... You're good. You're near. It's serious, isn't it? What is it? A billet-doux. From general yin-Tse. If tomorrow I don't deliver the weapons he partly paid, It will be my turn to face the firing squad. You remember the small farm courtyard in Canton? A handkerchief as a blindfold, eight Mauser bullets and the "coup de grace" with an automatic pistol. And it's finished. And you can't deliver... It's somewhat difficult. I haven't got the weapons. Neither do I have the money to buy them with. I understand. You're the same sort of millionaire as I. Not even that. I signed a cheque at the Eldorado. A rubber cheque. And If I survive, I'll get three years... forced labor. It does not matter though... I'm young... Then cheque was for 'fin Chem? Yes. And the funny part ls that Yin Chai is the only man in Southern China who trades modern weapons. 'Fin Chan? Tell me... What if I went? Where? - See Yin Chai. What for? I think I can square it all. And how will you? I know how. You'd do that for me? - Why not? You're the first man who gave me and took nothing in exchange. But I have got nothing to give you. Nothing. I'm not asking for anything. I live from hand to mouth. Soldier of fortune. So do I. What's the risk? Mr Yin Chai. This way... Proceed please. Nice evening. I can't believe my eyes. So you... you're the... Allow me... Please do. Poor Jasmine! - What? Nothing... I was thinking of something else. A ship leaves Macao at 7 tomorrow morning. I've booked a passage for you. Very kind of you! Coffin class probably! Here's your money. The house pays back. Great! It helps to have a relationship in the family. Keep an eye on him until he leaves. Why? Afraid of my talking to Jasmine? Take him away. The poor darling knows nothing. Worries me to think of father in law hanging some day in some town square at the end of a rope. Nice! I'll be gambling very little. - You're crazy! You're crazy to take me in such a place. There's nothing to fear since I'm with you. The Eldorado! What if your father knew about that? I'll tell him. - You will? He'll be quite pleased. Place your money in this small basket. In this basket? They have a strange way to pick grapes here! Sleepwalking? - Yeah! Why did you come? Don't know! - You don't? Yes... To see... Surprised, right? No! May I? Anxious? Some. I'm not used to this, you know. Never done it before. So... Do you like me? No. - I don't? How strange! - I knew someone once... who looked a lot like me. I know. You're all the same. I've heard that before. He let you come? Hey? Who do you mean? He sent you, didn't he? Who do you mean? Captain Von Krall! I'm nothing to Krall. If it was not for that weapon thing, you wouldn't be here. Krall is nothing to me. He forced you to come. I came of my own free will. His 25,000 $ cheque is not funded. You invited me to talk about Krall? A simple phone-call and Krall is arrested. Oh no, you won't do that. You want that cheque, don't you? Here it is. Not very clever, ls he? Your captain Von Krall. A small, very small adventurer. Small fish. And he uses women. It's not true. Don't you want to know where the weapons are? Leave me alone. I didn't ask anything. What did you expect coming here? I don't know. Me? It's all right. Will you? I intend to keep you by my side. What? I'm keeping you. Sorry, there's a misdeal. I've come... for one night only. I want to leave at once. It didn't work as you thought. Sit down! I won't. Sit down! I won't. You won't run very far. In Macao I do as I please. Leave me alone! Leave me alone! Leave me alone! To the harbor! Actually, Miss Marguenon, you're a woman of passion. That's right!... Will you keep silent! What happened to him, He was thrown pepper in his eyes. A woman it seems! Yes, the boss! - Yin Chai, the manager? Come on! Everybody out! What are you doing here? He's my... - Come on, come on! Out! Let me pass! Jasmine! Dad! As far as the rubber cheque is concerned... it's settled now. I did It for you. For you! I'm sorry. What do you want, girl? I want to see Mr Pierre Milley. You're unlucky, dearie. Mr Milley is not here. He's not back yet? - No! Can I speak to you, captain? - Of course. But who are you? Yin Chai's daughter. Come this way! Come in! This is Pierre Milley's cabin. You can wait for him. You're sure that he'll be back? - We won't leave with him. Thank you, captain. Right. Now I'll tell Mr. Krall. Captain! Do you think he'll agree to have me on board? Who? Mr. Krall? I'm quite sure of that, Miss Chai. Without any condition? - Without any condition. A daughter is invaluable, right? So... We agree? - Banco! You're a gambler too? Sometimes... When it's worth the risk. Good luck! Hey captain! Where are you going? He's going away! - Bastard! He abandons us! Can't you see he agrees with Krall? Come on, guys. The time has come! Let's get the hell away from here! - Let's go! Stop, you fools! You want to be killed by Yin Chai's machine-guns? Stop! Listen to me! Yin Chai's daughter is on board. Don't you understand? What did you say about Yin Chai's daughter being on board? Where were you? Quiet, darling! - What's going on? Where were you? Quiet, darling! - What's going on? They're shooting at us. We've got to leave this boat. Locked! I'm the "Amouna"'s skipper. And I'm coming on Werner Krall's behalf. About that small weapons' deal. No. - What do you mean "no"? Mr Yin Chai, you... - No use insisting. Excuse me, Mr Yin Chai. I also have news of your daughter. Where is she? On the "Amouna". You kidnapped her? I don't know about that. I'll have you bombed. No, not the right way. Let's talk, you and I. How much? Who? - You. Oh but I'm not for sale. What do you want? You know very well what Krall wants. He wants weapons. And how can I get my daughter back? If you accept, we'll let her go in Hong Kong. After weapons' delivery. Will you accept? I don't know. What? In one hour, the "Amouna" will be cleaned out. Yes. Totally cleaned out. No. It mustn't be. Have them stop firing immediately. I have an agreement with Krall. You got it? You heard me? All right, Excellency. You'll find the weapons at Lepers' island. At Lepers' island. All right. Go away now. Quickly. My daughter must be unharmed. Don't worry, Mr. Yin Chai. It's done! The deal is settled! Did he accept easily? Yes well... - What about the weapons? They'll be delivered straight away. At Lepers' island. Lepers' Island? What about his daughter? We'll disembark her afterwards. In Hong Kong. Right! Raise anchor. We're heading towards Lepers' Island! No doubt about It : Krall is using us as hostages. Coming on board the “Amouna", you gave Krall a real advantage. What will he do with us? I don't know. In any case, we're staying together. What will he do with us? I don't know. In any case, we're staying together. Of course... Pierre... do you remember when you were sending me signals on the "Singapore"? Hurry up! everyone's is at he back. Take the cutter in front and leave. No kidding? You mustn't waste time. Are you coming with us? - No... I'm needed here. Why are you doing this? Why? By sentimentalism. I won't have another opportunity. Thank you. Now, run! I'll take care of the rest. Good morning, Mr. Yasuda! I've got news. You're coming for your 503? I've come to earn them, Mr. Yasuda. Krall's yacht... The Amouna is carrying weapons to the Chinese. What? The deal was settled a few days ago. Unfortunately, I don't know where the Amouna is right now. We'll find out. Thank you. Excuse me... Excuse me, Excellency. I didn't understand. Good morning, Excellency! All your orders have been carried out. And it's really a wonder. Leave me alone. So... Krall paid you? I hope so. What do you mean? Aren't you sure? Yes. He paid. I wonder where he could find the money. You don't know? Excellency... Krall, paid or not, will see... What? I expect thanks. What have you been doing? In less than one hour, machine-guns and ammo will reach the bottom of the sea. A master's move, Excellency. I simply hand-signaled the Japanese bombers. How much ls that small favor worth, Excellency? You did that? Do you know who Is on board the Amouna? On board the Amouna? No, excellency. No. Don't, Excellency. No, Excellency. Don't shoot me. Don't shoot, Excellency. Jasmine! Subtitled by shakill/cinephage
