Watch out. Someone's coming. Let's get out of here. Headquarters, this is X-13. Suspect's car is heading toward Nancy Road. I repeat, this is X-13. Suspect's car is heading toward Nancy Road. Let's go. Hurry up. Swerve and go through the field. No, wait, the car will get stuck. Quick, let's go. Step on it. Push it to the limit. Headquarters, the plate of the fleeing car is 4252ST75. It's on Nancy Road. We've lost sight of it. They're armed and dangerous. Karl, take side roads. The main roads will be watched. - And the cops? - Don't worry, we lost them. If we don't get there soon, he won't make it. He's still bleeding. - If he dies - - Shut up. Spare us the commentary. Karl, fetch Dr. Ritter. Don't come back without him. - Idiot. Take the van. - Sorry, I'm just nervous. Bring him here as fast as you can. What a night. That necklace better not be fake. Wait. The lights. - Staring at him won't help. - Sorry. Call Ingrid. Have her come immediately. Come quickly, Surnett is hurt. Dr. Ritter? Where are you? Answer me. Wake up. Answer me. Just my luck. Listen, Doctor. Surnett is badly hurt. You must come at once. - Leave me alone. - Wake up, Doctor. - We need to hurry. - You're a fool. Treating a poor chap like me this way? I'll never forgive you. Go away. Get out of my house. You're coming with me. Leave me alone. What do you want from me? Surnett is badly hurt. He got shot in the head. You must come treat him. Henry is expecting you, and you know how he is. - We've wasted enough time already. - Where are we going? - Just do what I tell you. - Fine. Stop shoving me. Who shot Surnett? Wasn't you, was it? Stop joking around. Let's go. I don't understand. I can't. When the alarm went off, we hadn't opened the safe yet. It doesn't make sense. We'd even cut the power. Our plan was flawless. It's impossible. - What's keeping the doctor? - I wish I knew. I hope he gets here in time. If he dies, what will become of us? He's the one who gets us out of situations like this. Don't worry, Ingrid. lt'll only make things worse. Please, try to stay calm. Henry, the doctor is finally here. Will he make it, Doctor? He's badly wounded. There's not much I can do for him. I'm sorry, Henry. And all for nothing. I'd like to know what happened. I'll find out what happened in the jewellery store. - Save him, Doctor. - lt's beyond my skills. He needs an operation. Take him to the hospital. Impossible. You think they'd greet us with open arms? - It's the only solution. - Find another one. You know what Surnett did for you. lt's time to pay your debt. - Don't forget. - I won't. But he needs a transfusion. The bullet must be removed immediately. I can't do that. Not here. Just keep Surnett from dying. I don't care how. Just do it. Calm down, Henry. Leave the doctor alone. Don't worry. Doctor, help him. I need a drink. lt'll help me think. I hope to God this works. Tell us, Doc. What are you going to do? I have a close friend from medical school. He's made great discoveries in brain transplants. He's a genius, a scientist. I haven't seen him in a long time. It just might work. - Perfect. Where is he? - I remember where he lives. A tiny village in the middle of nowhere, far from here. I hope Surnett survives the trip. We've no time to waste. The police are looking for Surnett. Can he hold out until tomorrow? Maybe, if we give him a transfusion. He's lost a lot of blood. Yours will do. Fine. Let's not waste time. Ingrid, go back to the apartment. I'll be in touch. Yes. Don't forget. Life hasn't been easy for you, nor me. Surnett helped us both. He deserves our help now, and he'll thank us for it. All right, don't get all sentimental. All that matters is safely moving Surnett tomorrow. Careful, Karl. Try not to hit any potholes. Follow the road until the next fork. - How is he? - The bleeding has stopped. His pulse is weak, but he's holding on. Excuse me, could you give us directions to Professor Teets's residence? It's easy to find. Take the next turn. Drive. I haven't been here for years. The road is harder to recognise at night. Karl, we're here. Dr. Ritter. Let me just open the door. Come in, please. Doctor, we haven't seen you for quite a while. Here I am, back to visit my old friends. You're held in high regard in this house, sir. Has the professor already gone to bed? No. He spends his nights in the lab. He never rests. Please tell him that I'd like to see him. He'll be happy you're here. - Get Surnett. I'll persuade the professor. - You'd better. Go ahead, Doctor. My old friend, how swiftly the years pass. How are you? Why the late night visit? Forgive me, but I needed to see you. I'm sorry, I can't shake your hand. - What happened? - A lab accident. They're useless now. After sacrificing so many years to your work, how terrible for it to happen now. My mind remains the same, and my wife's hands do my work for me. Thanks to her, my experiments continue. Poor Ana. It must've been terrible for her. If only I'd known - lt's all right. The worst has passed. We have our daughter, and our work continues. - Come see. - Just a minute, please. Sorry, but I need to talk to you. I need your help to save a man's life. A man's life? When my wife died, it destroyed me. I sank so low that I was only able to survive thanks to certain criminals who required my services. Now, one of them is here, badly wounded. Gunshot to the head. You must save him. And my life too, in the process. Doc, what's the plan? Surnett can't wait any longer. Please, you must help him. You really should take him to the hospital. It's no use trying to argue. You must treat him and quickly. - Your wife can do it for you. - No, she can't. Our experiments were done on animals. What you're asking is different. A man's life is at stake. You must try. It will be a big step for you. Your first chance to experiment on a human. Sorry, I thought you were alone. - Is something wrong? - Don't worry. Put her to bed. I'll explain later. Go ahead. Fine. I'll see you later, dear. Hello, Ana. How are you? Dr. Ritter. I didn't recognise you. That's understandable. lt's been a long time. You're as pretty as your mother. Model yourself after her. It's late, dear. Our friend won't mind. See you later. Let's get to work. For your family's sake, don't waste any time. - What does that mean? - I'm sorry, my friend. This man is quite capable of carrying out his threat. Do as he says. All right. Bring the patient to the lab. You know where it is. To save this man, we need to do a brain transplant. Without another human brain of the same morphology and blood type, there's nothing I can do. Is one of you prepared to offer his head? I need the brain of a recently deceased man. We'll take care of it. But be careful, Professor, about what you say and do. I don't appreciate games. It's no game. I'm not trying to trick you. I'll do everything humanly possible, but I must warn you that the transplant may cause mental problems which could have terrible consequences. If we don't operate, he'll die. We have no other option. I accept the risks. Come with me, Doctor. Nap time is over. The professor needs a human brain to save Surnett. He thinks he could use one of ours. Let's hope the doctor has an idea to spare us that sacrifice. - A drink will help me think. - Seek your inspiration, Doctor. It's not easy. Betting our heads on a coin toss is one solution, but we'd need to do blood tests to decide the lucky winner. - I don't like your game, Doctor. - Why not take the butler's head? - Why not yours? - That's enough. We're running out of time. Doctor, you've been practising for years. Do you remember any patients who might be useful to us now? I have some notes in my diary. I think I have it on me. Yes, here it is. I make it a habit to note the blood types of my patients. - I found someone. - Perfect. Who is it? A while back, I treated a man you all know. - He'll do. - Who is it? Your worst enemy. The man Surnett hates most. The Sadist. - Correct. - lt's settled. He won't be easy prey. You two, take care of him. Don't come back without his head. And get rid of the body. I'd rather you chose someone else. Remember, it's the Sadist's head or yours. Hold on. To make certain the professor won't betray us, take his daughter. No, not that, Henry. Leave her with Ingrid. Don't forget, every second counts. Don't be afraid. She won't be harmed, as long as the professor cooperates. He'll co-operate. Let's go. You're coming with me. Is there a problem, Professor? We can't operate on your friend. My wife can't do it. Why not? She's worried about the danger of collaborating with outlaws. And she doesn't worry about the danger you'll be in if you refuse to collaborate? Don't be afraid. No harm will come to you if you do as I ask. You don't seem to understand the situation. A man's life is in your hands. If he dies because of you, you'll regret it. I suggest you accept. My hands won't aid in saving a killer's life. His death would only benefit humanity. Don't even try it. Your daughter isn't in her room. She's been kidnapped. You're all monsters. Where is my daughter? What do you want from us? Give us back our daughter. - If anything happens to her - - That's up to your wife. If she does the operation, the girl's in no danger. But if she doesn't - Understand? I know Henry. I know he won't hurt your child. He simply wants to force you to save his friend. Don't do anything rash, Ana. Help your husband and everything will be fine. I promise. We'll do it. Now the rest is up to you. It's being taken care of. What else do you want? If you don't mind, I'd like to be alone with my wife. It was smart of you to hire this act. It'll be a hit. You'll see. It's the first time you've congratulated me. You're interested in the girl, aren't you? Watch out for those two men. They know how to handle themselves. I can handle them. Don't worry. Our guests should have arrived by now. I'm in the mood for some gambling and some love. I don't understand why you play with those gangsters. One day you'll realise that all games, even love, need some spice. The game in itself isn't enough of a thrill. Let's go. They're waiting for us. - I win again. - Hands off. You're a thief. I should've skewered your hand. I've always hated cheats. Bastard, you'd rob your own father. You'll pay for this. You're a disgusting rat. Never threaten me again. Don't run to the police. I never want to see your face again. Get out of here. You too. Satisfied? Tonight I needed some excitement and I got it. You'll never change. You're addicted to danger and adventure. That's why they call me the Sadist. I'm starting to like the name. I doubt Barbara agrees. Too bad. That's how I am. I'm leaving. I have an important date. Don't tell Barbara that I left so early. It's risky leaving on your own. Too many “friends” would love to attend your funeral. - And me, theirs. - Who is it? No. I don't trust you. You might tell Barbara, and you know what she's like. It goes without saying that I don't want trouble with her. Bye, Willy. The sun will be up soon. How are you? Strange to see you alone. Here's a flower to keep you company. For you. - You're welcome. - Enjoy your night. See you tomorrow. What's the hurry, Paul? You wouldn't refuse a flower from me. Stupid oaf. Can't even appreciate a flower. Go to hell. - Don't you recognise me? - I hate being surprised. Don't do it again. I said I'd meet you at the bar, remember? Yes. But it was too crowded, so I waited outside. - Besides, it's better if we're alone. - That depends. Why did you need to see me so urgently? - What do you want? - Your help. - You left me for Surnett, remember? - I haven't forgotten. You knew he was my worst enemy, and you gave yourself to him. - You deserved - - But you didn't do it. I think you loved me, in your own way. I was very young then, and you were the first man - Who doesn't forgive and doesn't forget. Now everything is different. I know I could make you happy. What do you want, Ingrid? Explain yourself. I hate Surnett. I can't stand him anymore. I hate him. I hate him. It'd be a terrible blow to him if I moved back in with you. He deserves it. Want me to come back? Back when you were innocent, I liked you a lot. You know that. But now - I've grown up. I'm more experienced. You'll see. Come with me. Come here, Karl. - Where are we going now? - To the cemetery. I'll go in first. I don't like this. Shut up, will you? Now cut off his head. - Why me? - lt's your job, isn't it? This is different. Why didn't you tell Henry that? I'm no butcher. What's wrong? Get to it. You started the job, now finish it. That's what you get paid for. Okay, I'll do it. Hear that? Let's go before they release the dogs. We can't leave the body here. Help me. What do we do now? We'll bring back the body and let Dr. Ritter cut off the head. Fantastic idea. What do you think Henry will do to our heads? Damn. - We have to carry out orders. - How? You lost the knife. - It's your fault. - What a night. Damn Sadist. We need to find a solution. Let's use our heads. Before we lose them. I've got it. - The solution. - An idea? We'll put the body on the tracks. Then when the train comes - - What do you think? - How do we know when a train will come? Don't be so pessimistic. lt'll come. Ready? Stop the van. Couldn't it have come a minute later? How long until the next one? What a mess. Shut up and walk. That's done. Let's get out of here. The next one will do it. You think so? Henry's going to be furious. Our heads might have the same fate as the Sadist's. Shut up. You're making me nervous. Sorry, Paul. I won't say another word. Darling Ana, even if we're punished by the law, it's a huge step for science. May God protect us. He knows we're doing it for our daughter. Darling, concentrate on what you're about to do. Pay close attention to my instructions. We need to remove the lobes damaged by the bullet. Be very careful. Make an incision one inch from the wound. Be very careful, Ana. Now, a four-inch trepanation. Good. Now insert the probe. Like that. Good job. That's good. The bullet didn't penetrate the brain. Here it is. Now you can cut the lobe. Stay calm. You've already done it many times, dear. I know it's different, operating on a human being, but eventually, it had to happen. I'm sorry it's under these circumstances. We can't stop now. Scalpel. Now it's time to perform the transplant. It's the most delicate part. Do the vein compression and lobe stitches exactly like in our last experiment. Be very careful. Do it, Ana. Is there a problem? He needs electronic stimulation. Give it to him, Doctor. It's complete. You can finish up the stitches now. Take him off anaesthesia. Cardiac rhythm is slowing. Give him an adrenaline injection, direct to the heart. Quickly. I think we've succeeded. We've been waiting for this for years. Darling Ana, you were amazing. I'm so proud of you. I hope to God it wasn't all for nothing. Allow me to congratulate you. You know why I did it. Are you pleased? I know what you want now. We kept our part of the deal. Tell your friends to bring back our child. - I'll do that. - I hope so. What will you do? You can't go on like this. I can't stay long. lt's late. I'm a wreck, a disbarred doctor. A drunk coward whom no one can trust. Not even me. You weren't responsible for your wife's death. Her affliction is still incurable, and instead of fighting, you fell apart. You're absolutely right. These days, I can still earn a living thanks to these men. That's their power over me. You're a good doctor. Let me help you. Tell me how. What can I do? You've already done a great deal for me. A great deal. Doc, how was the operation? They saved him. They did fine work. - Can I see him? - Not now, Henry. First, keep your part of the deal if you want everything to go smoothly. Bring back their daughter. You promised. You know me. I swear I'll do it. I'll get the girl myself. Satisfied? Where are you going with that? The last remains of the Sadist must be destroyed. Wait a minute. I have a very amusing idea. Come with me. I'll explain on the way. You stay here and take care of the governor. Tell the professor we're fetching his daughter. Don't lose the head. I'll need it. I came to get the child. - Henry, how is Surnett? - Don't worry. He'll be back on his feet soon. - Tell me the truth. - The operation was a success. They assured me he's out of danger. - These last few nights have been awful. - For me too, Ingrid. I was afraid it was all over, but we all did fantastic work, and you played an essential part. It's thanks to you that we got the Sadist's head. - I can't stop thinking about it. - You must. I have to get back before day breaks. Can I come too? I feel like a prisoner. Fine. Get the kid ready to go. The morning papers will be out soon. I'm sure we'll make the front page. Wake up. We haven't heard anything about the boss, and all you can do is sleep. Read the headlines and think, if you can. “The Headless Man. Macabre Discovery. A body was found on the rail-road tracks -” No need to read it to me. I know what it says and it frightens me. You d0n't think it's - He's missing, isn't he? Stop imagining the worst. You know the boss. He insisted on leaving by himself and you know that means - Be quiet. He loves you, Barbara, but he enjoys variety. - Be quiet. - There's a reason he's called the Sadist. - Please, be quiet. Enough. - Don't get upset. Do you usually receive gifts so early? Who's it from? If you're going to be like this, you'd better leave. In that case, good-bye, Barbara. You're too upset. Hi, boys. Come on in. - Hi. - Hi. - Well, what did you find? - Nothing. - No one has seen him. - Not even his best friends. Willy, you're the boss now. So act like it instead of wasting time with insinuations. Okay, okay. Don't get mad. It was just a joke. I'm intrigued by this pretty package. Forgive me, Barbara, but do you usually receive gifts so early? - Do you know who it's from? - I don't know. When I went to get the paper, the doorman gave it to me. Someone left it at the desk while he was out. That's odd. Anyway, let's find out what the surprise is. “From some friends who wish you all the best.” The bastards. Who are you looking for? Answer me. Sorry. Don't be afraid. I'm Paul, a family friend. I'm visiting for a few days. I haven't met everyone yet. I'm Emmy. I deliver the professor's paper, and I play with his daughter, Natalia. He usually answers the door. Is he sick? No. He left early this morning, so he told me to say hello for him. If you don't mind, I'll take the professor's paper. I don't mind. Good-bye. See you tomorrow. Tell Natalia I'll be coming. - What did that girl want? - Nothing. She delivers the paper. - What did you say? - That I was a family friend. She's harmless. Never trust appearances or women. Fantastic. And on the front page. Listen: “On the rail-road tracks, a headless man was found. It's impossible to identify him because -” The Sadist's friends will be furious. I wish I could've seen their faces when they opened the present. Good work, boys. You know Surnett will be delighted. Here, take it to him. No, wait. He's with Ingrid. You'll be well soon. I had a nightmare. Everyone abandoned me when I needed them, even you. I love you, Surnett. I'll never leave you. What's wrong? Trust me. You'll soon be back to normal. Leave me alone. My brain is torturing me. I can't control it. Get away. It's stronger than I am. - What's wrong, Ingrid? - I don't know. I don't understand Surnett's behaviour. He wants to be alone. He's never spoken to me like that. For the first time, I was afraid of him. His regard is different. I've noticed the change too. I don't understand. The professor says it's too early to draw conclusions, but I don't trust him. Ingrid, get the Doctor. Perhaps he can explain what's wrong with Surnett. Get him, even if he's drunk. We need him. Do you know if the Sadist was here last night? I wouldn't worry. He's probably in good company. When he desires ours, he'll show up. I need to know who he was with. lt's important. I haven't seen him. Ask Barbara. She knows him best. I don't understand why he's still with her. What's makes her so special? She's soiled goods, but she knows how to please the Sadist. She's the brains of the operation, and business is booming. You know that's why they put up with each other. But the Sadist will never change and Barbara knows it. Don't let her hear you say that. You know her. I know what she's capable of. No, you don't. Good-bye. I'll wait for you tonight. Don't worry about them. lt's not worth it. Aren't you tired of wiggling? lt's time to go to sleep. Hi, Willy. What's a night owl like you doing up so early? - Did you lose something? - If only. Our friend the Sadist is keeping me up at night. Quit dancing and answer my question. Were you with the boss last night? Not me, Willy. I'm not the favourite anymore. Did any of your friends have contact with him? - What sort of contact? - You know perfectly well. Of course, but I've got better things to do than worry about the Sadist. Everyone knows their own limits, and I think his harem is well stocked. You're mistaken. Anyway, I don't know anything about anything. If you hear something - You seem really worried. I need to sleep, but I can't. See you later. The first flower of the day is for you. The last flower, last night, was for your governor. What? Where did you see him? Right here on this street. He seemed to be in a hurry, but he looked happy. He'll never change. You seem worried. What's wrong? Tell me. ls it serious? Is that all you know about the governor? What's the word on the street? There are rumours. Lots of rumours. Now talk. Did you read the papers this morning? People say the Headless Man is - - You don't know anything. - Wait. There's more. You know Paul? One of Surnett's boys. Last night, he was in a big hurry. Nervous. He was headed in the same direction as the Sadist. How's that for a tip? I hope it'll be useful. Thanks. I'll be seeing you. Good luck, Willy. Nobody's home. I think one of them must be wounded. Where would they have taken him? There's a car full of bullet holes in the garage. No doubt about it. They ran into trouble. But I still don't see what this has to do with the boss's death. - Paul should know. - Where can we find him? If one of them is hurt, the only doctor who'd treat him is Dr. Ritter. Let's pay him a visit. We can't take a drunk like you seriously. Let's hope Ingrid is more convincing. She doesn't know anything. Leave her alone. It's Willy. Listen carefully. Right now I'm at Dr. Ritter's. I have a surprise for you. - Really? - Our dear friend Ingrid is here. Yes, I thought you'd like to see her. Come over and give her a taste of the suffering she's put you through. - I'll be right over. - Good. We'll wait for you. Hurry up. We're going to have some fun. Tell us the truth, baby, or no one will recognise you, not even Surnett. If you don't talk, we'll turn your body into an open sore. You won't be so pretty for all your male friends. Stop. That's enough. Leave her alone. She doesn't know where Surnett is. But you do? - You'll take us right to him. - Careful, Willy. You know Surnett's tricks. Yes, and he knows mine. Now, it's important to hold on to Ingrid. She's valuable to him, and he'll try to get her back. And the doctor? For now, he's our guide. Later, we'll see. Take the girl to your apartment and treat her well. She'll be useful to us. André will stay with you. Doctor, if you care for Ingrid, make sure you don't get lost. Your friend Surnett wouldn't like to see her like this. I'm surprised she's not back yet. I called, but Ingrid didn't answer. Neither did the doctor. It's strange. We'd better go see what's going on. The men downstairs will take care of you. Don't worry. Everything will be fine. His pulse is normal. I think the critical moment has passed. I believe he'll recover very soon. The professor and his wife saved your life. You should thank them even though, thanks to you, their theories have become fact. Am I wrong? Under other circumstances, I'd have been pleased with my work, but now, what can I expect? Once we leave, we'll be nothing but a bad dream, easy to forget. But like it or not, Professor, when you speak of your success, you'll never be able to forget that we... facilitated it. Come on, dear. Time for bed. I know you don't like us being in your home, but we've got to put up with each other. - I can't. - Of course. You can't stand - - What do you call us, madam? - Please, let me pass. I envy your husband. He's a lucky man. Leave me alone. Come on. No one's answering at lngrid's. What should we do, Henry? - The doctor must be dead drunk. - Yes, but not Ingrid. I'll go get her. You take care of things here. Ingrid is in danger. She needs your help. I think I said too much, but it was to protect her. That's the truth, Henry. I couldn't stand what they were doing to her. The Sadist's men? - Barbara. - Such brutality. Tell me who did it. What's the point, Martin? lt's my fault. Forgive me. Forgive me for the harm I caused you. - What can we do to save Ingrid? - Nothing. Willy wants us to rescue her, leaving Surnett without protection. But we won't. We'll wait here. Let him come to us. Then what happens? You've no right to risk our lives. If we abandon Surnett, they'll kill him. - And I know what they'll do to you. - Then let us leave. Professor, you can't abandon your patient. If they kill Surnett, it destroys all you've done. Remember that. Then I'll stay, but allow my family to leave, please. I'm sorry, but you're useless without your wife's hands. From now on, we'll keep watch outside. Two-hour shifts. Got it? But first, we need to bury poor old Doc. One of you, come help me. Want to guard or dig? I see you can already get up without help. You're improving daily. You'll soon be able to stroll about the grounds, if all stays calm. What happened to me? Something's changed inside me. - Tell me, Professor. - lt's too early to make a diagnosis. There might still be some disturbances. Last night, my head was pounding. And then I felt something that frightened me. I'm not the same man. I can feel it. Don't worry, Surnett. I'll do my best to cure you. And if you can't? I can't answer that now. Lies. You're lying, Professor. You know what's wrong and you won't tell me. - I demand you tell me. - So be it. I warned them of the danger the operation posed for you. Henry accepted the risk. There was no other option. Otherwise, you'd be dead. What did you do to me? If these urges get stronger, what will happen to me? Karl. Tell my wife to come quickly. I heard shouting. What's wrong? Your husband needs you. What is it? Psychological changes, as I predicted. lt's progressing quickly. We must give him the same treatment we used in our experiments. - Our results weren't completely - - I know. But it's the only option. We have to try. If we don't, everything we've worked for will be doomed to fail. No, we can't accept it. I can't. It would be awful. It's time for action. We've waited long enough for them to come out of hiding. Now they'll have no choice. Take this. And make sure it works. Pour us both a cup, Karl. We need to be alert. Yes, we do. We've been up for a long time. And it could go on. As each night falls, I become more afraid. It's too quiet. Willy's trying to spook us, and it seems to be working on you. Only me? I think we're all alarmed, Henry. Don't deny it. You're worried about Willy, but even more about Surnett and his strange behaviour. Shut up. Go take your shift. With everything that could happen outside - Keep your eyes peeled. They've been peeled for so long they'll end up falling out. Paul, it's me. Answer me. Don't hide. You know I hate games. If you don't come out, I'll shoot at the first shadow that moves. Stop fooling around, Paul. I found Paul. Tell me. They hanged Paul from a tree. If you kill me, you'll also destroy what remains of the Sadist. It's hard to explain. Anyway, you wouldn't understand. I don't care. You're Surnett, and you deserve to die. Yes, I'm Surnett. But different than the one you knew. They transplanted part of your friend's brain into my head. Scoundrel. Now I feel what he felt and desire the same perversions. If I don't kill you first. I'll show you the Sadist still exists. He's in me. He'll be there as long as I live. Shut up or I'll strangle you. Look what I found near Paul's body. What? “From some friends who wish you all the best.” Now the poor doctor has some company. I hope he'll be the last. Stop talking. You scum-bag. Finally I understand. That's what messed everything up. That necklace was in the jewellery store. It was linked to another alarm which went off when you took it, you idiot. Let me explain, Henry. I didn't know. You didn't know it was a fake either. Only an amateur would be tempted. You messed everything up. - I should kill you. - Don't make me shoot you. I'm sorry for what I did, but I can't change what happened. You and I are the only ones left. If one of us dies, the other won't be able to protect Surnett. Think it over. You've always been smart, Henry. Don't force me to make another mistake. We need each other. But you'd better pray that we get out of this alive. Henry, what happened? Surnett isn't in his room. Someone unlocked his door. - Did your wife let him escape? - Never. He represents too much for us. It must have been Karl. Only he would do it. Freeze, Karl. Drop your weapon. Why are you doing this? Bastard. Where's Surnett? I don't know any more than you do. - I should've shot you last night. - I swear, this time you're wrong. Traitor. I don't know where Surnett is. Please believe me, I'm begging you. Did you hear that? It came from close by. Let's check it out. Let me go. Surnett. Let her go. Give me that. Surnett, you're making things worse. Come with us. You're still in recovery. Come with us. The professor needs you. Why? I'm going mad. I can't stand it. You're my best friend. Why did you do it? Why? It was either that or let you die. You should've let me die. What will become of me? The professor has faith in his treatment. Trust me, Surnett. Come with us. I don't want to go. I can't control myself. Please, Henry, don't leave me like this. Let's take him back. The transplant has finished replacing the damaged part of the brain, but we were unable to control its effect on the patient's mind and his reactions to that strange and dangerous influence. These new reactions stem from a basis - Stop. That's enough. This man is a danger to all of us. - We must let him die. - Don't say that. Before we operated, he was a danger. Now he's part of an experiment for the good of mankind. To let him die would be worse than murder. I won't do it. - Then I will. - No. You're insane. Care to tell me what's going on? Nothing of importance. For the first time in our lives, my wife and I disagree professionally. - Meaning what? - That's our business. You want to just let him suffer? It's not easy for me to think the only solution is to end his life, but it's an option we must consider. - Don't even think about it. - All right. But I can't help him. So keep Surnett, your experiment, but think of your wife and daughter. What will you do to protect them from Surnett and from the Sadist's gang? They're not like us. Think carefully. Take my advice. Madam, don't let your husband's obsession destroy you too. Professor, remember that the newspaper girl saw us. The whole area must know by now. We have to leave. We can't accuse the professor without proof. Wasn't my daughter's condition when she returned proof enough? I agree, but I can't believe the professor is guilty of such insanity. - We all know him - - Mayor, my daughter was attacked by a stranger on the professor's grounds. A few days ago, some men in a van asked directions to the professor's. Since then, no one has seen the family. You should find out. - Or we'll do it ourselves. - Calm down. Be patient. We don't need vigilantes. What you say makes sense. Let me handle it. But I need you to be patient. I'll call the police. - What did the professor decide? - He's mad. Let's get out of this death trap. - Where will we go? - To lngrid's. They won't hurt her while they're after Surnett. But afterwards, I know what they'll do to her. - After that, where will we go? - Anywhere is safer than here. - Unless you'd rather stay? - No way. Find him. Let's go. Your father told you not to let anyone in. Find a place to hide and stay there. Run. Why did you come back? Get out of here. They would've killed me. They're here for Surnett. Give him to them, Professor, and you'll save all our lives, your family's. No, forget it. I'll never hand him over. Then defend us. Shoot them when they open the door. I'll hand you over, Surnett. I won't die for you. Come out. Come out of there. Let me go. Karl. Open the door. Forgive me. I had to do it. Do you understand?
