Yes? All right, come up. I'll wait for you here. - Hi, there. - Hello. Sorry, I'm a bit late, but Fridays are crazy. - People loosen up. - Yeah. Look, I'm sorry. Could I use the bathroom? I'm pissing myself. Really, I can't hold on. This place is really far away. I had to use the bike. If I didn't come to see you, I'd never be here. - Do you come by bike, or by car? - On the subway. - Right. - In there. That's much better. Thanks. After all this time, I still don't know what you do. What is this place? - A real estate agency. - Yeah? I'd no idea. How's it going? Are things getting better, or...? - Yes, they are. Listen... - Raúl. - Raúl, I have to keep working. - I'm bothering you. - A bit, to be honest. - You're in a hurry. - I've got things to do. - Sure, sorry. Well, here? Yes, here. - Are you sure there are no cameras? - You always ask that. - These buildings... - There are no cameras. Come on. - I've got no change. - Fuck! I'm sorry. Another client had the same problem. He left me without change. Have you anything smaller? I could go down and get change. - No, forget it. - I won't be long. Just give it to me! Sorry, I'm kind of distracted. I've got a lot on my mind, you know? - Wait for me here. - OK. - I have to give you coins. - No problem. It's all money, isn't it? Hey, I wanted to tell you. Next week it'll be another guy, OK? - OK. Won't you be here? - No, I won't. I won't be here for a while. The contact is the same, same number, same everything. - OK. - I'm going away. To Australia. - Australia? - Yeah! It's crazy. I won a visa on one of those lotteries. A two-year work visa. A friend and I applied together. Fucking thousands of people from everywhere applied, and I won. He didn't! Australia, fancy that. I did it as a joke. What do you think? - About what? - Me going to Australia. I don't know... Fine. Have you been? - In Australia? No. - Neither have I. Fuck, that must be gigantic. A whole continent, the antipodes, right? Listen, Raúl... - Are you high? - What? No, why? No reason. - Can't I talk without being high? - Yes, yes. I'm telling you something personal and you say that. Forget it. I did two lines, but I'm not high. Want one? No. - And you have to go. - Come on, it's on the house. I've never won anything and I win a visa to work in Australia. Christ. I don't know. I don't speak English. But, with my job, I'm very sociable, I get on with people. So, in a couple of months... - What are you going to do there? - Gardening. - You're joking. - No. I hear there's a lot of that work. There are lots of gardens there and... They need people to look after them. Are you a gardener? Me? No way. I did a module of electricity. But I need a change. Does that not happen to you? Like you feel something has to change. I've been doing this for years. My mother is so upset about me doing it that she got a stye on her eye. No, really, it's that big. It was all red. The same day the poor woman got the stye, I got the letter from the consulate. I'd forgotten, I'd no fucking idea what it was. I open it, look at it... It was obvious. I said: This is the change, kid. This is the change I was expecting. Australia. Gardener. Whatever. I envy you. You do? Why? No, forget it. No, tell me. I don't know. Being able to go there, far away. It's good. Yeah. That's easy to say. I have to get back to work. That's true. So, that's it. - I hope it goes well. - Thanks. Listen, I was thinking and suddenly... Can I ask you something? No pressure. If it's no, it's no. - Go on. - Well... The thing is, no one knows me there. So, to get a job, you're advised to bring as many references as you can. I don't understand. Could you give me a letter? A letter? Of reference. For what? No, fuck, it means nothing. I mean, they won't even read it. But it's good to bring a letter from someone here, someone who recommends you. And, to be honest, I can't think of anyone. But you've got a good job, right? This is a good company. You want a company letter with my name. To say I worked here at something. Security, maintenance... It's just to have something. Everyone does it, otherwise you don't have a chance there. Look, this isn't normal. You come here, we do a few lines. You're the only person I can think of. - I'm sorry, but... - No. - Why not? - Just because! You're my dealer. You don't recommend your dealer. Are we crazy? It was a favor. Has no one ever done you a favor? I don't know. My whole fucking life I've done whatever I wanted, really. Whatever I wanted. Now I'm kind of... scared. I don't know what to do. It's never happened to me before. Has it happened to you? Ever? - Answer me, has it? - No. It hasn't. Yeah. Well, it's shit. Anyway... I feel that things are going to happen. You'll see. You'll remember me. No... You'll remember it was me who told you.
