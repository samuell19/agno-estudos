Maybe it's this particular tunnel. It happens on a bullet train. There's the ocean. That sounded funny. I said it right. - Ocean. - Sounds funny. Intonation is off. Emphasis on the first syllable. It can be said the other way. Ocean. Whatever. Not important. We can't see anything. No Kobe today. It's beautiful on a clear day. This resembles our future. Hey, don't be so dismal. It's not that bad. Future for 37-year-old women is bright True. But it's dismal out there. Stop it. Sakurako's rice ball is yum. Really? Looks cute. too. I'm eating Jun's sandwich. Ground beef cutlet. - It's fantastic. - Really? I used good beef. No wonder it's juicy. Thanks for bringing. Experienced cooks. I'm happy since I don't get compliments from my family. Nice to be appreciated. - Yummy. - So yummy. Thanks for that. Akari's juice is good. Oh, good. Fruits for dessert. - Thank you. - I want some. Please. What a day for a picnic. Why don't we go over the hill to Arima? There's a bus service. Hot spring? I wanna go. But we want more time there. I wanna enjoy being in Arima. Shall we plan a trip there next time? All of us? - First overnighter. - You're right. Arima is perfect. Let's pick a date. Up to Akari and Fumi's work. Fumi is off on Mondays. Then it's up to Akari's schedule. Okay then, how about two weeks from now? Too soon? I've got something on that day. Not gonna work. Let's check on other dates. Early August? Looks good to me. Yeah, I can probably do that. Sorry about that. It's gonna work out perfectly. Wanna come to this? It's this weekend. What's this about? Something physical? - Actually I don't know much about it. - No way! The first event planned by Kawano. The flyer went out late so we have no attendees. Looks interesting. I can make it. Sunday. How long is this? Till 5 p.m. but it may go longer. I see. Can you go? I can get permission. I can ask my mother-in-law to cook dinner. Your mother-in-law must be understanding. Hard to say. We're still figuring each other out. Never lived with her? She's nice but who knows what she's thinking. Yikes. That's nerve wrecking. - Don't push it. - I'll be fine. What about Jun? I'm basically free. That's cool. Kohei must be understanding. Yoshihiko, too. Not sure about that. You have your hands full with Daiki, your son. Takuya is nice, too. It's more like he doesn't care much. That's my case. That's enough all of you. So the workshop is next weekend. Our trip is early August. Yes, ma'am. It's our revenge for today's rain. Hi. Hello. You look tired, Dr. Kurita. - Hey, Akari. - Yes? Do me a favor. - Ouch! - I'm so sorry. Yuzuki, I'll do it. It's okay. - Let me. - Okay. Let's see. It won't take long. Make a fist. Disinfectant wipe. Allergy with disinfectant? No, I don't. Is my vein hard to find? A little. We're all different. Okay. We're done Don't rub. Just hold it. Okay. Take over now? Sorry about that. Wow, that was fast. You're good. Dr. Kurita, you owe me one. Then let me take you out. What do you like? I was only kidding. I'm embarrassed. Why? She's not trained. I think Yuzuki is hanging in there. Sorry? She's sticking with you. Come on. My supervisor was a lot tougher on me. - Dr. Kurita, he's ready. - Okay. Thank you for taking over. - Your second year. - Yes, ma'am. - You need to do better. - Yes, ma'am. - Do not rush. - Yes, ma'am. - Don't get nervous. - Yes, ma'am. Don't make patients nervous. That's the worst. Yes, ma'am. Appreciate your guidance. Was this a storage space before? It used to be the customs office. Interesting. What a nice space. Thank you. I'm embarrassed that I didn't know about PORTO. That's expected. This flyer looks great. Thank you for making it. Glad you like it. Is this space okay for your workshop? It's fine We won't do anything strenuous. Anything we need to prepare? Maybe a projector to show your activities? Not necessary. Will you take care of running the workshop? I'm just gonna go with the flow.. The flow? I'll see how it'll go. Okay. How many attendees do I have now? Seven so far. Only seven? The flyer may not explain the content of the workshop well. I see. I'm starting to feel bad for you two. We may still get more people. People will respond to this. It's a good flyer. The content being vague can be attraction to some. But if it's vague, we need to reach out to people who understand. True. Maybe you could ask people you know to attend. I can do that. We know it's really ourjob. We apologize. No need for apology. Thanks. Sakurako, your miso soup is good. Oh, good. I think it's too thin. Daiki, your mom changed it for me. I told her it was too salty yesterday. I didn't really change it. But I'm glad you like it. I'm done. More croquette? No, thanks. I don't wanna get fat. Seriously? You could gain some. Back to homework now. Tea for you, Mother. Yes, thank you. Daiki likes to study. But it's not showing in his grades. Is that right? He could be playing with his friends with the mobile phone in his room. Then why don't you check on him in his room occasionally? He's a teenager. He'd hate that. That's true. When Yoshihiko was his age, I caught him smoking in his room Really? He doesn't smoke now. Teenagers. What did you do? I just slapped his face a few times Wow... I couldn't do that. I'd probably ask Yoshihiko to do that for me. Thank you. I had to play the roles of father and mother. You're right. But you're a good mother, Sakurako That's why Yoshihiko can leave Daiki's care to you. Not really. See you. Good night. - Did I make you wait? - Nope. I know I did. I was reading. No worries. I made you wait. No, you didn't. That was yummy. Yeah, it was good. Are you sure? It was good. For real? For real. I bet you wanted to drink. You should have gotten a drink. I didn't wanna make a fool of myself. You wouldn't have. You're cute when drunk. How about Kitano next year? Innards barbeque in Nagata? Innards on our anniversaiy? We can drink Korean sake. I like that but... Shall we drink at home? I m getting an article around midnight I need to review. Okay. I'll work on grant application then. All we do is work. After midnight, we go back to our usual selves. You're right. May I order another? Of course. How's your time? I'm fine but what about you? Is anyone watching Suzuka? - Oh, her. - Is she alone at home? She's got a sleepover. - You sure? - Yes. Good timing. I feel better then. Were you concerned? I was worried about Suzuka. I should have told you. Sorry. No worries. You're so kind, Akari. - Same one? - Yes. May I ask something? Sure. Are you seeing anyone? What? No, I'm not. Really. Why? Well, I thought I may be in luck. - Actually... - Yes? I'm not interested in a love relationship. So I'm not looking. Just not ready for it. Amazing. What is? I don't want a love interest either. Then a mother for Suzuka? Simple answer is yes. But it can't be just anybody. Can I see you again? Suzuka doesn't open up easily. She's a shy girl. I trust her judgment in people. I haven't seen Suzuka that happy I miss seeing her, too. But I don't wanna see her sick. That's not what I mean. I'm home. Welcome home. Did you eat? Just snacked. Make me rice with tea? - Your mother said... - Yeah? Government offices just exploit the employees. How come? The assembly is over now. She asked why you're still busy. Just ignore her questions. Easy for you to say. The work never stops. I have something to ask you. Can I go on an overnight trip? Overnight? With Jun and others. I guess so. When? Early August. Could fall on Monday based on others' schedule. I see. I'll prep meals before I go. Daiki will be off school. Not while my mom is around. This is special. I don't want her doing things. I know. I feel a bit nervous around her. My sis and mom are both stubborn. Their separation may last long. She can be helpful so I don't mind having her. It's from Jun. Tell her I wanna tag along. What's up? Yes, it's fine. Yes. don't worry. Jun? - Sakurako! - Jun... Let's go. Sorry if I shocked you. It was a shock. You've never acted like that. You're right. You're always the cry baby. What do you mean? Why did you tell me? I couldn't hold it to myself any longer I'm happy you told me. - But... - What? I'm not as good a liar like you are. I know. About Akari and Fumi, right? I may not be able to hide it. I don't know how to face them today. It's up to you if you wanna tell them. Of course I won't tell them. Hi, there! Thanks for coming today. Write your name on a tape and put it on your chest. Around my hip okay? Yes, that's fine. You can change in the changing room or the bathroom over there. Hey, you two. You look so ready. I know. I'm always ready. You're always so cool. Hello, I'm Kei Ukai. Nice to meet you all. I appreciate spending your Sunday with me. Let me introduce myself first. I'm originally from Kobe but after the big earthquake three years ago, I went there to volunteer. I tagged along my friend but I ended up staying in Tohoku longer. You may wonder why I'm doing this workshop. That is... I'll cut to the chase and show you what I mean. When I had time to myself while I was in Tohoku, I started doing this to the debris along the coast. Imagine all the debris just balancing like this on the beach. That was the scene. Some local people didn't like it but I just got into it. I couldn't stop. And my obsession became a news. I got offers from various organizations. In my three-year stay there, I got contacted by shelters, art centers and even religious groups. This is similar to a trick. Anyone can do it. I'm bored with it now. But now I've reached this phase of my life where I'm blessed with the kindness of others. What I want to figure out is how to achieve one's balance. Today's topic is "Listen to your center." You may wonder about this. I want to explore unconventional ways to communicate with others. That's my goal. Well, let's do a quick warm-up. Don't you wanna try making the chair to balance? Why don't we all try it? Move the chair around to find its center of gravity. When you feel no weight, that's when its center of gravity is perpendicular to the floor. The weight just pulls away from your finger. Like a floating robe of an angel. That's when you let go of your finger. Well, that was our warm-up. Let's get started now. Place all of your back against the other's as much as you can. Your shoulders and your hips must all touch. You imagine yourself and the other person have united and become one. Your heels are next to your butt. Think about putting weight on your little toes. - Ready? - Yes. Let's try Three. two, one. Pair up with your neighbor and let's try this. It's important to rely on your partner. But if you rely too much, it may not work. Leaning too much! I think we're ready. Let's try. That was easy. They'll screw up. That one was easy. Let's do with more partners. As a group of three. You don't know your own size. But you have to relay your size to others. Use your backs to communicate with each other. That's the goal. Nicely done. Are you ready? Let's go. Easier with three. Too easy. Change your partners and form a bigger group. That's good. Try with that group. You have to be able to communicate with others. To find the center of balance among your group. Don't care too much about others by making yourself too small. Not gonna work. You need to relay your real size to others. Let's be greedy and try with all of you. How many people do we have today? Ten people. So all ten of you have to find the center of balance. Three, two, one! Too bad. You were almost there. But I guess it's not that easy. Okay, let's move on and try something else. The next exercise is to find the center line. The center line isn't something you hear often. Basically, it's a line of an individual that goes straight down the center of that person. I'll do it with Kawano. Okay. There is a line that goes straight down the center of my body. And Kawano has it, too. We're gonna align our center lines. Imagine you're being pulled from above. It's easier that way. You tried to balance the chair earlier by moving it around. Use the same idea with your body. Sway your body like this, to adjust your center line with your partner's line. Is this it? Wow. - Got it? - Got it Good. Pair up with someone to this exercise. Let's see it. You have to use your whole body to show your line so you can find your partner's line. You have to let your partner know where your line is. You look so tense. I want you all to just try it. Doing okay? When you start seeing your lines and when the lines align, start moving in a circle. If your center lines are aligned, your partner will start moving as you move. So move in a line of circle. - What? - You look tense. I'm trying to focus. Start moving. This is really hard. If your center lines are well adjusted, when you move, so does your partner. Your body automatically moves when your partner moves. At good timing, a new person joins like joining a long jump rope. Joins in that circle. The center changes when more people join. So you have to find the new center. That's good. Thank you. Now onto the main topic, which is "Listen to your center." Let's pursue it further. Let's start by pinpointing what you think when you talk about the center of your body. We all typically think of this spot. Your abdomen. That's the point below your naval about a fist distance. That's your "Tanden." Let's focus on this point. I'll ask for Kawano's help. Let's see. Wherefs your Tanden? Here's my naval. Then it's here. Put your ear against his point. I can hear it grumbling. Maybe my lunch is being digested. I can hear that happening. That's good. So, this is it. This is the point. Listen to your guts. You have all these organs inside your body. Listen to them as a pair. Shall we pair up? Let's try this. Hear my guts. A bit lower? Around there. You hear anything? Wow! What was that sound? I can hear. I'm nervous. A bit nervous. I'm not asking you to find the right sound. Really? Full of water? Human bodies are basically made up of pipes. Connecting from your anus all the way to your mouth. That's how it is. You're warm. Really warm. Wanna hear mine? You wanna hear my guts? It's grumbling. I don't feel that though. This is amazing. You can switch turns to listen. With your partner. I hear it deep in there. Tell you partner the sound his or her guts are making. Rolling sound. Lots of sound. Lots to say. How was that? I thought that was the most comforting moment today. The room was filled with warmth. Let's take this a bit further. Will you help? Next one. Your forehead. Against my forehead. Can we try it? We put our foreheads together just like this. Hold the lower part of the neck. Better to use the hand of the same side. Hold this part of the neck of your partner. It's better if you close your eyes. And we send our thoughts. You have to decide who's gonna send and who's gonna receive. Let's see... Keep it simple, like one word. And send that word. From here? Yes, from here to here. So your thought can circulate through your partner. Like a prayer. Is it a cat? No! - I was wrong. - You were but... It's kind of close but not. - What then? - Gorilla. That was way off! I was amazed. Why were you amazed? I expected to you say something completely different. Like, "what a nice day today." I'm not asking you to perform supernatural power here. So it doesn't matter if it's not absolute. But as we do this, I'm sure you felt some type of connection. Why don't we try this in pairs again? - Were you nervous? - Shut up! Which one? You wanna send? Shall I send? A deer came out of the forest. Wow, it wasn't a deer. It was a black panther. But I was close. I felt something coming out. You got the action. Not getting it. Were you sending it? I thought you were sending, Kazama. I wasn't sure who was doing what. No wonder. Nothing yet? - I'll send something. - Then I'll receive. Something with hands. - That's amazing. - What was it? - I was thinking manicure. - Manicure? - Aren't you shocked? - I am! That's good. Thanks everyone. I want to get comments from everyone. But one last thing. Let's try that again. Squeeze our bodies together. Are you guys ready? Feeling good about this? You look so ready. Let's try it. Kawano. Then let's make sure your heels are close to your bodies. Let's try it. Ready? Three, two, one! That was too bad. I thought you'd do it. Why don't I join you and try again? Maybe over here? Move a bit foiward. Feels okay? Use your bodies to talk to others. Communicate with them. How about the people in my back? Let's try this now. I'll call out the start. Let's do this. Here I go. Three, two, one! We did it this time! I'm ecstatic! That was great. I'm amazed we did it. Let's hear your comments. You first. Yoshie. Your comment, please. When I stood up, I didn't know if others were also standing up. So we all had to look at each other to confirm what we did. That was a great way to acknowledge each other. I loved how that felt. So I really enjoyed it. It was a group effort. Thanks for your comment. Who's next? What's the best way to describe this? It wasn't just the center line, but we heard the guts and touched foreheads. I wasn't completely sure what we were doing. But I was trying to listen to others and others were listening to me. That was a nice feeling. It's rare when others are willing to listen to you in everyday life. It was nice to know that others cared about me. Not many would listen to your guts. Not many would be pleased to listen to my guts. You liked that. That's my impression. Simply touching others was really fun. I actually felt happy. I didn't really think deeply about what we were trying to achieve. I could drive myself crazy if I did. Having my ear against someone's stomach and vice versa. And the foreheads. That felt really great. It was a happy moment. So I thank you. I'm actually a nurse by profession. So I touch patients all the time. Of course I'm careful with it. But I never thought about from their standpoint. It never occurred to me that the patients may be feeling what I'm thinking that day. I feel alarmed about that. Great lesson though. - Thank you for that. - Thank you. Who goes next? Let's hear your comment, Hinako. You want me to say something? - Sorry? - You want me to? Well, only if you feel like saying something. To be honest, I didn't get today's session Overall, I felt everything was left very vague. I wished there were more explanations. I guess you're questioning my accountability. Is that necessary? If you gave us more explanations, we may see more shortcomings. Shortcomings? You wanna share that? So that's what you want. I'll respond to that. I'll give you some logical explanations what we did today. You tried unusual ways to communicate with others. In searching for balance, you felt your center of mass disappear. That process is something that goes far beyond communication. Something more solid. It's more to connect with others. Or to engage. Or more like a marriage. The feeling of becoming one. It was the time of happiness, feeling of ease and comfort. I'm sure you felt that. You may feel at ease but you also feel a sense of uncertainty. Since you've lost the connection with your body, you lose the balance you had with others. The balance falls apart. When that happens, you have to listen to your body again. Or have others listen to your center. Then you can reconnect and restart communication. You connect with one another again. But then you lose your center of mass. It collapses again. I think it's a repetition of that cycle. I know what we did today might have been strange. But I think what you learned may be applied to your life. Don't you agree? That's my hope anyway. This ends my workshop today. Thank you for coming. - Really appreciate you coming. - Thank you. Oh, hi. Hello, there. We survived. That was a strange workshop. It was. It was fun though. Sakurako. Yes? Areyou free after this? Grab something to eat? Sorry, but I'm with friends. It's okay. I'm also with friends. What? Yes? Why did you ask me out? I wanted to bail out. Well, I'm not flaky like that. It's fine. See you. Good night. What's up? I wanna hear Fumi's guts. No, I won't let you! She's obsessed now. Who's obsessed? Weren't you nervous? When? The forehead connection. Natural to be nervous. I was nervous. That's expected. Risky workshop. You're right. - I loved it though. - Really? I forgot all the yucky stuff. That's good to hear. We're getting together afterwards. Ukai suggested we join him. - Where? - That cafe over there. You sure we can join? Of course. Others are coming, too. Can you stay? I told them I'll be late. Do you wanna go? Let's see... You're scared of Ukai. Why would I be scared? I wanna join you. Can I? If you don't mind. I don't mind. Then let's join. Cheers! Cheers! Kanpai! Was today's event Kawano's idea? Yes, it was. Ukai is the first artist I invited. I'm overjoyed right now. Glad I came. Why did you choose Ukai? I saw the debris he balanced by the coast. In Tohoku? During my volunteer days, I saw the debris standing in impossible ways on a deserted beach. That was a shocking sight and I got curious. Then a strong wind blew and the debris fell one by one. How dramatic. It happened on my first day there. It was really spooky. I couldn't forget what I saw. I came upon an article on Ukai and found out what that was. Then I found out Ukai is giving physical workshops. I wanted to do it as our event and I talked to Fumi. She encouraged me to do it. I didn't know that. I experienced many coincidences and felt it was meant to be. Thanks for that. No, I thank you. You attended the workshop. Hinako. Yoshie. Hey, why did you pass me? He's Kazama. Thanks, Sakurako. That's not like you to remember names. I had my forehead against his. I hope my breath was okay. It was fine. I would have brought breath mints if you had warned us, Ukai. What a creep. Even if you had bad breath, no one would tell you. Why would you say that? No girls would tell you that. You haven't learned your lesson. Hey, stop picking on me. Are you all friends? We kind of grew up together. Then I worried for no reason earlier. Worried? Hinako said she didn't get it. I was surprised by her comment. Didn't you think that workshop was lame? It was lame. I was expecting a sales pitch for a strange cult. Has he always been like this? I guess he hasn't changed much. I think he's mellowed out. Was he more extreme? He was gonna make us all kiss today To find out more than just touching our foreheads. Touch your backs, then your foreheads. Why not your lips next? Not gonna happen! I could see he was holding back. He has matured. What was he like? I think this is what he wanted to be like. - Have I changed? - Yes. I hate you even more now. You do? I love you though, Hinako. But you looked like you were having fun. I was. That made it worse. Normally I don't get to touch someone like we did. That was nice. I was happy to be touched by Akari. Jun's tummy was making noise the whole time. It was nice to touch each other for no reason. We did that when we were young. I know what you mean. You touch only because you want to. We were touching someone when we were little. There were many games like that Like "a thousand feet up the Alps." "A thousand feet up the Alps" "On top of a pheon" "Let us all dance the Alpine dance" Well done, Kazama. My sister taught me. Let's do one, Sakurako. Remember it? How does it go? "Summer is approaching Time to pick tea leaves" "Young green leaves cover the fields and mountains" "Do we see the ladies picking tea leaves" "With red sash on their sleeves and wide brim sedge hats" I don't know that. I remember the Alps one. Isn't that old? We were in the history club. We taught kids how to play this For real? I didn't want to. But did for your grades. Are you all schoolmates? From junior high. 25 years. Wow, no I wonder I feel old. We met them in our 30's. Fumi invited them. I invite them to our events. I see you ladies often. Are you always the guineapigs? We attend only if we're interested. I wanted to know more about my body. Did you gain anything? Like I said, I found it beneficial for my work. So I'm glad I came today. Thanks. So you're a nurse. It must be tough work to be a nurse. Will you stop that already? I don't like lip service. Say it only if you mean it. You're right. Makes me sad since we shared our guts. I know. I apologize. Stop apologizing now. I spoke from perception not from the actual knowledge. It's fine. Let's stop this. Actually, can I take this opportunity to ask you? Is it really tough work? That is such a turn off. I guess it can be. But what's the truth? Let me try to explain simply. We talk about aging population. I bet you don't think it affects you. But what you hear on the news is all true. I may sound blunt, but patients don't die because of advanced medicine. There used to be a point of being considered dead. But now our lives can be extended by surgeries or medicines. What would that do then? We have more patients with illnesses who develop dementia. What they do first is start wandering in the hospital. If we don't catch that, they escape the hospital. Even if that won't happen, we'll face problems with managing medicines. They can no longer manage taking meds at certain time. They can't feed themselves. The level of care they need is completely different. When those situations arise, we face a very serious problem. Let's say a patient who escaped the hospital gets in an accident. Or they could take their own lives. That's gonna be our professional negligence resulting in death. Professional negligence resulting in death. A nurse can't win at a trial. That's horrible. - Horrible, right? - Impossible. But that impossible situation is the reality. So many nurses lose their future by paying for the damages. So we need to have liability insurance. Is there such an insurance? There is. I have one, too. I pay high premium for it. That's harsh. Really harsh. I doubt myself sometimes. - But... - But? The hardest thing is those situations distance me from the care I really want to provide. We have to protect us and our patients. Patients have motion sensors or they're monitored on cameras. Some have to be tied up. Those are becoming the norm. Don't you wonder about the ethics of the care? This is far from the ideal care. We can't give care with compassion. Our job becomes more mechanical. I find myself justifying my behaviors to my subordinates. I tell them we have to perform our job. And I'm just stuck in that place. It's not right. We become nurses because we have an ideal image of helping sick people. We never talk about it. Everybody feels the same. But when I realize how far I am from the idealistic work of a nurse, I hate myself and that's the hardest reality I have to face. See, I knew I'd make you all feel depressed. What do you do then? What's your escape? I go out! Play hard! I go out drinking, to a concert, work out or go shopping. Or talk to friends all day. I let it go completely and play. I turn off the switch inside me. So I put everything in today's workshop - Appreciate that. - No, I should be thanking you. What's your love life like? Does falling in love help you in any way? I guess... What do you think of Akari? What's this about? She's great. What's this about now? I take that Akari and Jun are single. Jun is married. So is Fumi. Sakurako is a mother of a teenage boy Do I look single to you? You have no wedding ring on. Sakurako and Fumi have rings on. Why are you snooping? I'm only stating a fact. Now I'm getting annoyed. So how's is your love life? You're persistent. He's back. Sorry? This is like how he used to be in the past. So his true self is coming out. I think having a love interest is important. If I have to be honest... - Should I say? - Sure. I'm divorced. Really? Not because of that but I don't have anyone now. I understand what you mean. Why? Should I say this? You might as well now. - I'm also divorced. - Seriously? But you look so young. How old are you? I'm 28. I got married when I was 26. Lasted a year. But most of that was spend in court. In court? What about you? I signed the paper and that was it. That's so cool. What was the reason? - Her infidelity. - Really? Kazama, let's drink to us. I'd love to! How did you know she was having an affair? What about you? I never asked but he kneeled down and apologized. What an idiot. Why fall for his conscience? Be a man and keep it a secret until he dies. Didn't you know about it? I knew something was off. Maybe he sensed that. But why did he have to say? How about you? - It was her smell. - Smell? She had a different smell. Are you a dog? I loved how she smelled. I used to fall asleep to her smell. How romantic. But she came home late one night. When she got in bed, I noticed she had a different smell. Not cigarette? No, it wasn't like that. It was a specific smell she had. That smell of hers was different that day. Maybe she changed her shampoo? I thought so at first and asked her if she had changed her shampoo. Then she went crazy. She can't lie. I asked her why she was going crazy. She was coming home late so I knew something was up. I asked for explanation. I wouldn't get mad so just tell me. What a wimp. When I said that to her, she started to cry. She knew this guy before our marriage. She wanted to end it. She was suffering. So I told her I would forget about it. But since that day, I couldn't trust her completely. When she was out, I'd worry that she was seeing him. I know. I had to do something about it. I told myself I had to trust her. I was gonna buy her favorite cake to take home. So we could talk and start over. What a great guy. But... I saw her with the guy. What? The bakery was also a cafe. I saw them by the window. He was holding her hand. What did you do? Did you barge in? - I ran away. - Why? My heart was beating so fast. That was a wimpy move. So I went home. And she came home late. I told her I saw her. She accused me for stalking. She didn't believe the coincidence. She got mad for not trusting her and stalking her. She left me that night. Then a lawyer contacted me. Mediation didn't work so we went to court. What did you argue about? Didn't you agree on a divorce at mediation? I was gonna divorce her but she wanted my asset. What a witch. The guy could have been advising her. I didn't want that so I had to get a lawyer and we went to court. That was hell. But you had the winning hand in court. Normally, yes. I was a total novice. I had no evidence to show. She was desperate so she made up stories to tell. Like I was abusive to her. But you weren't abusive? This man cannot hit a woman. I guess... Our marriage was short but we were a couple since college. You know, we were in love once. You have a romantic side. I do. I'm a romantic type. Don't just admit it like that. In order to win, we said things that made our marriage sound miserable. We picked on our personalities. That's harsh. In the end, I asked to settle it out of court. She took half of my asset. - That was lose lose. - It was. But Kazama, you're a good guy. Let's drink! Thank you! If I can advice you guys, avoid going to court. Good advice. I stopped seeing my wife the same way. She became a different person. Really. Don't be so melancholy. Kazama. I'm in the middle of filing for a divorce for a year. Your wife was lucky because you gave up fighting. It doesn't go like that. Really? Hey, this is the first I'm hearing this. I haven't told you. Am I the only one? I'm saying for the first time. Sakurako knew. I had an affair. With a guy about the age of Kawano or Kazama. I bet you're mad. - Why would I be? - You are. Because you didn't tell me! Why do you disclose such an important matter here? Why did you talk about work earlier? You never told us that. - Because I was asked. - Same here. I didn't say it because no one asked. I said it because I felt like saying it. How's the divorce going? I'm not sure if it would happen. My husband won't go for it. Unless I can prove he was at fault, it won't happen. Why doesn't he want the divorce? He says he forgives me. Do you love each other? I don't love him. Is he at fault for anything? I don't just blame him. But... But? That's not a good winning argument. So I make up stories. I'm being a horrible person. - You still see the other guy? - Yeah. How can you criticize Kohei then? Who's at fault here? What's marriage if you keep being so selfish? Why do we promise? I've never been married but I can see that happening. I know it happens. But that's not right. What do you want her to do? What happened can't change. What do you mean? Do you want her to admit that she was wrong? It's not your business. It had to go to court. We can't help ourselves. We all know that no one is at fault when infidelity happens. But you have to blame it on someone You wonder why you hurt so much if no one is at fault. That's why you have to blame someone I'm gonna go. I talked too much. I'll follow her. Ukai and Kawano, thank you. Take care. Did I say anything wrong? I'm not ready to say that I was at fault or I was wrong. I know people don't understand. And that's okay. I don't understand. But I think it's okay. That's what I think. What? I don't know. I may be angry, too. Sakurako knew about it. Understandable. They know each other much longer. Who are we to them? Can you leave me alone? I don't wanna say anything bad. If I say something, it'll come out wrong. Good night. Good night. Don't look like that. It was my fault. You knew I couldn't keep the secret. You're wrong. It's just as I said. I felt like saying it. I don't care about others anymore. I wasn't even thinking about you. I'm sorry. I don't understand you anymore, Jun Wanna come to court? Divorce court? Then you'll understand. My train. Hey, Jun. What's wrong with you? - Can you get up? - I think so. - Want an ambulance? - No. I'm home. Daiki, time to get up. - You're such a good mother. - I try Jun, I'll take you to the station. Thank you. Can you leave now? - Leaving now? - Yes, thank you. Good morning. Hi. Why are you here? I spent the night. - That's what the noise was. - Sorry about that. Look at you Daiki. You've grown up. How tall are you? 163 or 164 centimeters. When did we go karaoke? I don't remember. A few years ago. Time to eat. See you. - We're off. - Bye. Sakurako, thanks so much. - I'll call you. - Chat later. Morning. Good morning. Coffee is ready. Thanks for making. Thanks for the blanket. Oh, that. Fell asleep while working? I was reading Mr. Ukai's interview. By Art Press? He's interesting. You think so? He uses so many words to express he doesn't know. Is that what he did? You know the book reading by Ms. Nose that I'm organizing? What do you think about Mr. Ukai as a guest? Well... Will he do it? He's not compatible to Ms. Nose. That's even better. He's not that famous. That goes both ways. Any problem? I should have said this when you took on the event. I don't wanna mix work and our private life. Okay. I don't wanna push my husband's events. I wasn't requesting it. I was only asking your opinion. I guess you're right. Not sure about that. But you were helping me before we got married. I love the space of PORTO. I wanted to use the space. I better go now. Already? Forget about Ms. Nose's reading event. I can check other locations. - No flyers are printed yet. - That's not good either. I'll find other guests. You upset? No, I'm not. I don't get it unless I'm told. Sorry about that. - I'm off. - Have a good day. Looking for this? Your car key. I'll ask about Ukai. He is kawano's contact. I shouldn't just say no to you. I'll ask. Okay, then let me know. Thanks. - Have a good day. - See you. Are you happy? Why do you ask? Beautiful wife. Cute son. I may look happy. But you're not? My life at home may be. But not outside of home? You can say that. How is your work going? What I do is hit the ball that comes my way. Hard work at the office? Any work is hard work. I've never said this to you before. What is it? You have become a respectable man. What's this about? But you don't laugh anymore. You think so? Hey, watch the road. Sorry. Be nice to Sakurako. You're weird. She's a great person. - Did she say anything? - Nope. Then what's this about? I can't help myself when I see you two. I care for her. But I don't show love every day or buy her flowers. I take care of work. She takes care of home. We have our responsibilities. How nice. - That's normal. - No, it's not. Do you talk about that? We don't check each time. Do you love her? - I have a favor to ask. - What is it? Can you stop asking Sakurako out? You girls are going to Arima. She can't do that all the time. Did Sakurako tell you about my divorce? Yep. About the divorce court, too? I feel relieved. - Why? - You two still talk. You're weird. Did that make you worry? We're not like you guys. I'm not like your husband. Sakurako isn't like you. You're right. Important year for Daiki. Boys that age worry about their moms. Don't worry. I won't ask her out. Not forever. It's just for this year. Don't worry. It'll be that way. Thanks for the ride. - See you. - Thanks. Bye. In Awajishima. Remember what we ate? What did you eat? - Don't remember. - Chocolate. Was it chocolate? Hello? Oh, hi. What's up? What are you mumbling about? Marriage? Really. Congrats. It's something to celebrate. Wedding? I won't go. Why would I go? How can you be so stupid? Hello? Hello? Are you there? Idiot. I won't go! Oh. Sakurako. I thought you were someone else. What about divorce court? Oh, Jun's deal. She wants me there? I can't answer now. Not sure if I can go. Sorry I have another call. Email me the info. Thanks. You know, you don't get it unless you're told. No bride would want the ex-wife of her husband at the wedding. I will not invite you to my own wedding when that happens. Defendant's Exhibit Two, Article One. Please listen to the recording. Somebody? You have a man. That's your idea? You guessed right. I love someone else. Do I know him? No, you don't. I was with him today. You've already done it? We've had sex. For over a year now. Right here. Here, the plaintiff clearly admits to having committed adultery. It does not match your previous testimony of no adultery since marriage. Is that true? I was not calm at this time. I lied because I wanted to hurt him. I see. You want to hurt him. Why? Why... You have testified that the defendant has never physically abused you. Violence is not the only form of abuse. I have been psychologically abused by my husband. Are you saying he was verbally abusing you on a daily basis? On the contrary, we barely spoke. Since when? You've lived together for 8 years. Gradually. But, we had a little of that from the start. I'm asking whether there was conversation. "We had a little" means basically you did have conversation with each other. It was not meaningful. I couldn't understand what he said, and I don't think he understood me either. But there was conversation. It doesn't show he had no intention of communication. I feel he showed no interest. Without interest, conversation doesn't exist. I see. Without interest, did you feel lonely? Yes. How did you deal with that loneliness? I had my friends. My friends gave me moral support. Are your friends female or male? They're female. Do you have male friends? I do. Do you spend time alone with a male friend? Yes. But not often. But you do. Were you sexually active with the defendant? According to the defendant, you were active without any problems. It wasn't "without problems." What do you mean? The defendant stated that you were often the one starting it. I've wanted a child ever since I got married. Yes. I thought a child might solve our problem. But it was only a few times a year. Even that was often refused. You stated, "I lied because I wanted to hurt him." Yes. That sounds to me like it is out of love. What is it? You're romantic. You're just a man too. Refrain from irrelevant statements. The defendant has stated his unchanging love for you from the beginning. If you yourself have truly not lost your love for your husband shouldn't you try communication rather than fight for a divorce? Objection. He's manipulating the answer Objection sustained. The defendant states that you've refused communication from a certain time. I believe that's true. But, it's not because I wanted to. Then why? I was killed by my husband. Please explain. It's true that I loved my husband at one point. I feel that I gave him the best part of me. I tried to be a good wife. I wanted to support him. My husband trashed all that. For 8 years, he kept showing that the effort was useless. I kept feeling that the most important part of me was gradually being killed. Can you be more specific? In one word, he did nothing specific. That's how he killed me. I see how you feel. But without a specific incident we cannot make a decision. It will work against you. Thank you for coming. Well, you looked worse than I expected in there. Hi. Hi. Hurray. Huh? I was hoping the smell of curry was ours. That's good. Oh, mushrooms. By the way... Huh? What was Kohei like? You interviewed him about two years ago Kohei? Jun's husband. The scientist. Mr. Hino. That's him. Why? No reason. Well... a typical scientist. I couldn't understand him. But he was a good guy. A good guy. - Ms. Nose got really excited. - Really? He was bombarded with questions but he was pleasant to the end. That was for Ms. Nose too? Yeah. We were lost. We were planning a sci-fi. That's way off track. I was young back then. By the way. I can drive you all to Arima Really? It's for Ms. Nose's interview. She's writing about hot springs in Arima. Ms. Nose and hot springs. Go ahead. Thank you. I plan to check in on her. So if I adjust my schedule, I can drive you there. Thanks. I hope we're not troubling you. Don't worry Thank you. Great curry. It's good. Yesterday... I went to Jun's trial. - For her divorce? - Yes. How was it? It was hard to watch. I see. She's going to lose. Yeah? Is there anything we can do? Like what? I don't know. Don't interfere in other people's affairs. She's my friend. You don't know who is right. Does it matter who is right? It's Jun. I'm home. - Hello. - Good morning. Good morning. How far did you go? I walked to and from the station. I saw Daiki on the way. He was early. He went to basketball practice. - I thought the season was over for him. - It is. I think he should retire from the club. You know... Maybe I shouldn't say this. What is it? Last Sunday, he brought a girl home. They went into his room to study together. - Did you know? - No. You went to play golf. And Sakurako went to... what you called the work something. She was there when I came back from the book club. I did all I could. I played the innocent old woman. Knock knock, do you want some juice? Would you stay for dinner? I went into the room every 30 minutes. She said good-bye in the evening. But... But what? I saw the same girl now. Right after I saw Daiki. Do you mean they were meeting up? Have you had the contraception talk? I'm much too old. But the young generation is different from even yours. Here we go. Let's get up. Ow, ow. That hurts. Can't you do it gently? Sorry. Yuzuki is much nicer. I'm sorry but we loaned her to out-patients. She's softer too. Really? Sorry about that. Mr. Toyama, that's sexual harassment. No way. Your face is a harassment. Hey, Yuzuki. A star? Alright, let's go. You're back at the ward. Yes, from tomorrow. I need you to be useful. Yes. You know, Yuzuki... Yes. You need to make a big mistake. Huh? You keep making petty mistakes. I'm sorry. So you need a good mistake. A good mistake? A huge mistake that you can barely recover from. That's awfully difficult. You need that experience otherwise you won't learn the seriousness of this job. Seriousness? You lack concentration because you're not scared. So you keep doing it. I'm sorry. Did you experience that too? Everybody makes mistakes. Yeah. I once considered quitting after a huge mistake. Another nurse helped me. So, I want you to have the same experience while I'm still around. Thank you. What is it? You're so reliable. Don't rely on me. Here you go. That's 280 yen. I'll call my lawyer. Go ahead, I just want a word with you. Can I come in? Nice room. How much? Thirty-five thousand. That's cheap. It's hot. Can I open this? Hello, this is Yoshikawa. Yes, please. My husband is here. That's right. He forced his way in. I'm in the bathroom. Can you come? Yes, please. The police? No, that's not necessary. Goodbye. You can't win. I took a psychiatric test. I'm completely normal. An unreliable test. Let's end this. No need for the verdict. It's a waste of time. End it, then what? Come back to me. Do you want some tea? You can't say I forced my way in if you offer tea. Open the windows. I won't return. Regardless of the verdict, I won't ever go back to you. Even so. You're my wife. That's just on paper. If I live alone for 6 years, it becomes void. Divorce me, and then? Live with your boyfriend? Probably not. You're going to be alone until you die. Then it's just the same. I was always alone. You're not good. Good at what? I won't get angry. I won't shout at you or hit you. What a pity. What should I do? I want to change. You can't. I don't expect you to change. I could kill you now. It's not so high. I might break your neck. Do you want to? Leave. - Good morning. - Hi. Where's Fumi and Takuya? I'll get some drinks. - Night shift? - Yeah. You look tired. I think I might melt in a hot spring. Do I look so terrible? You got a new boy friend? Cut it out. You look good. Yeah. I'm sorry about what I said. No, I made you say it. You have to quit lying. I can't stand lies. We can't be friends if you lie. OK. Sorry. Basically I believe everything. So if you lie, the whole ground shakes. Huge earthquake. Tremble. Are you two patched up now? We've always been good. - Right? - Right. Whatever. Good morning. What's so funny? - Good morning. - Good morning. Thank you, Takuya. No problem. Are you doing an interview? A writer I work with wants to do a story on hot springs. There are famous spots like Kusatsu or Hakone. But we don't have that kind of budget, so she's writing in Arima, the nearest. She's confined until she writes. What's her name? Do you know Kozue Nose? No. Ah, you don't know. Oh well. Is she young? Twenty-five. Her first novel was pretty popular. You mean Shiratama? That's it. Have you read it? We interviewed Kohei before. I really cried. Is it moving? Maybe it just fit my feelings. That was your work. I'm really glad you liked it. There's a book reading at PORTO. Mr. Ukai is the guest. Really? Is he going to be alright? Still, I'm looking forward to it. That's sure to be great. I'll invite you all. - I want to go. - Yeah. - Ukai too. - When is it? The first Saturday of October. I I think so. I'm free. That's quick. How about you? Saturday... at night? It's at night. I should be able to go. I want to go. Can you go? I'm not sure. But I really want to. Just build your schedule around what you want. You're strong. I'll send you the flier. She'll read the one she's writing in Arima. Are you going to stay in Arima too? Yes. With a young female novelist? Just like a tabloid. Hey Eumi, shouldn't you be worried? Shut up. I wouldn't be taking you there. Wow, great view. This is great. Where shall we go first? Hey. Hello there. She's cute. We can hear the splash. Yeah. Let's take a picture. Let's take a picture. Can you press the button? You have to smile in a picture. Fumi too. When you see the smile later, you'll think you had a great time. It is really fun. Here we go. Get closer. One and five is? Six. One more. Hold it. Yes, that's it. One more. One and one is... Two. That's enough. Sorry, but it's a great picture. Thank you. Thank you very much. Oh, here it comes. Yeah, that's Ron. Again? Chi-toi, double dora. Oh no. That's full score. Only Akari pays for Ron, right? Yay. Sakurako, you're good. As a kid, I used to play with my grandma. It's so much fun it could ruin my life. She said so, and taught me. I didn't know. But your life isn't ruined. No fun. I haven't played recently. Most people don't know how to play. How about Yoshihiko? He doesn't. I haven't told him I can. The innocent girl? I just didn't have the chance. Takuya can. - Really? - Yes. He has the right poker face. Shall I call him? You two can play as a pair while he teaches you. No, let's not. Why are you edgy? Edgy? Me? Because you saw them. They were just walking. What is it? I want some truth from Fumi. That's fine. Don't worry about me. Fumi and Takuya are a curious couple. What's curious? You two talk. But it seems to be just on the surface. Remember, it's just an outsider's view. It's between you two. On the surface... I'm not sure, but that's how it feels. It's like there's a thin veil between you two. Like you both try not to touch it. That veil didn't exist when he was walking with Ms. Nose. Takuya seemed to be relaxed. Even so... What do you want me to do? Nothing really. Are you angry? Not angry, just... We're worried about you. Worried? I'm one to talk. I know you all worry about me. Trying to find a solution. So that no one gets hurt. That aside, I'm worried. Are you having fun? Can you say what you want to? I always enjoy myself when I'm with you. - But... - But what? I don't think I have to say everything. And even if I do, I don't think you'll accept me. What nonsense. I'm actually very selfish. We know. I see. You can't hide it. You're stubborn too. I didn't need to hide it. Of course. Fumi and Sakurako are selfish. Me too? Yup. And me? I'm worried about your cowardice. Of course I'm scared. Aren't you afraid anymore, Jun? I'm scared of everything. You see. I'm stepping in place. But I don't want to give up anymore. I feel that I'm seeing a part of my real life. Real life? I don't care what others say. I'm going to say what I want to. I don't want to give up. - Greedy girl. - Yeah. But I think that's the real Jun. What's that? I've known you for a long time. But it's like I'm meeting you or the first time. Really? Then, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, on the 25th year. Wow. A quarter century. What's your name? Oh, I'm Sakurako lba. A beautiful name. Thank you. What's yours? I'm Jun. Jun, that's a nice name. Nice to meet you. I'm Jun. Nice to meet you. I'm Akari. Your name suits you. Really? You make us all bright. Nice to meet you. I'm Jun. I'm Fumi Tsukamoto. Nice to make your acquaintance. I was going to say it's a beautiful name. I feel kind of embarrassed. No need to be. We've seen every part of each other. That sounds dirty. What is it? "The sound of your guts." I don't like this. Come on. Me too. What... Cut it off. The camera person. The quartet. Yes, thank you. How was the picture? It turned out great. Look. Like a band. I thought so too. You're not a local. No, I'm from Mie. Why? I travel around for waterfalls. Yeah? Even my name is Yoko Takino, with water in it. I feel a sort of bond with waterfalls. I see. Are you going home? It's a bit earlier than I planned, but I have to return to my parents. Can I ask why? It's alright. Is someone in your family sick? Something like that, but I'm not sure. Why is that? It seems that my father hurt himself. But my father is a liar. I don't know if I should tell this to a total stranger. Go ahead. Thank you. My family grows oranges in greenhouses in Mie. My father was fixing a greenhouse or something yesterday And he fell off a step stool. Is he alright? He says it's alright. But I can't be sure. Why? He always tells meaningless lies. My grandpa died when I was about six years old... My father told me Grandpa was in Osaka on business. I can see why he lied, but it's meaningless. But I believed it for about a year. Really? I really thought it was true. There must have been a funeral. He told me it was a party. But you put flowers in the coffin. I was asleep the whole time. I see why the lie was possible. Even after that... The family didn't talk about Grandpa because he's not there. I kept believing he was in Osaka. Then one day around dinner time, there was a visitor. We let him in and offered him tea. Then he started telling Grandpa's memories. That's only natural. I thought he was really strange. The man talked about Grandpa as if he was dead. So I became a bit angry. Grandpa was supposed to be alive. You didn't see? Well, once you believe something, it's hard to change your perception. I see. Then the man asked to offer an incense for Grandpa. I thought I had to speak up. If my parents were too polite to say it, I had to say something to the man. Then my father led him to the family altar. I thought it was strange. So I went with them to see the altar. My Grandpa's funeral picture was right there. A picture. Yes, it was there. Didn't you notice it? It was probably too obvious to notice. That's so strange. Isn't it? And your liar father got hurt. Yes. So I don't know what to believe. I see. I thought that maybe he is actually sick or something. So he made up a different story. Why do you think so? - My mother called me yesterday. - Your mother. She sounded strange. Strange, how? She was probably crying. Crying and sounded a bit hoarse. But she insisted he fell off a step stool. So I sort of panicked. And I decided to visit them today. I'm sorry about the jumbled story. No, I think I kind of understand. Really? Thank you. Um, where are the other three? They went home. I had extra time, so I stayed a bit longer in Arima. Are you all friends from college? We met after turning thirty. One is from middle school. That's a long time. Yeah. How did you all meet? I introduced them. What is it? Ah, you have that look. I like bringing people together. You think I'm the busybody, don't you? I knew all three separately. I thought if they met they'd like each other. And then? Bingo. That's a great story. Why? If I can make such great friends after I turn 30, it'll be exciting. How old are you? I'm 28. Then, no problem. You'll make lots of friends. - A lot? - Plenty. There are so many wonderful people, it's harder not to like someone. Is that so? If you like a lot of people, some of them will like you But according to your theory, that happens because you're attractive Wow, thank you. You're attractive too. Thank you. Can I ask what you do? I'm unemployed. To be exact, I'm an ex-homemaker Ex. Actually, it ends today. I'm in a divorce suit. Today, the verdict will be given. Oh really? Yes. We will be stopping at the next stop. I have to get off. Thank you. Not at all., The doors will close. I'll work it out. Welcome. Iced coffee. So, what is it? As I said on the phone, I'd like to ask you ladies about the whereabouts of Jun. I have questions to ask you too. Akari, you really have no idea? Nope. How long has it been since Jun left? It's been three weeks already. Why didn't you tell us sooner? It's sort of a private matter. So I've been searching on my own Her family has no clue either. And I believe... she is pregnant. But I didn't ask her directly. I know that. She told me so. Her guy has disappeared too? He had no idea. They broke up a long time ago. Pretending, maybe. I hired a detective. So I'm sure. Kohei The easiest way to find her is that you accept a divorces If you care about her and wish her to be back, then you should do that. - I can't do that. - Why not? What she's doing is against the rules. Huh? Marriage binds one to follow a set of rules in society. So she must live by the rules. Of course, it's not permanent. She can break it off. But it has to be done according to the rules. I've never broken them even once. I follow the rules... Shut up. Enough of the rules. Why do you say, "shut up"? I'm only answering your question. Now I understand why she left you. Then, please share it with me. You don't have warmth. Warmth... I don't feel you as a person. I can't imagine living with someone like you. Then, what should I do? Nothing you can do. That's probably what she thought. If that's the case, I wish to hear it from her. All I want is to talk with her, But why in court? You feel nothing for Jun getting hurt? Going to court is her idea. I don't understand her. You'll never understand her. There was no chance she could win the trial. It was a waste of time. We both lost our credibility. So, who cares? Right. That's not important. Kohei, you have no idea about where she might be? No, not at all. I'm worried about her health. Well, I want to provide her with a safe place to give birth. I want to see the baby too. That might hurt you though. Don't you think? It's mine. Come on. Get real! It adds up. It's my child. Did you force her? No, never So then, are you saying she's disappeared, carrying your baby? That's right. We used to talk about having kids before this happened. I think we can change things if Jun comes back now. We might be able to stay together. Please call me if you hear anything. I'll excuse myself. I'm grossed out. He's really crazy. You think it's true? You mean the baby is his? That's his delusion. If not, then that means she's been deceiving us. Why would she do that? Who knows? Maybe she's ashamed of banging the man she is divorcing. Akari. I said, "maybe." What on earth should we do? What do you mean? What's the best thing to do? There's nothing we can do about it. It's her own decision. - She could be in an accident. - No way. Obviously, she did everything as she planned. She moved out in advance, huh? I wonder why... Jun didn't tell me anything. You think you're the only one that's been hurt? Fumi and I are facing this too. She really didn't tell you anything? Even about her pregnancy? I didn't hear it from her. Why didn't you tell us? I wasn't sure if it was okay to tell anyone. Did you say, "anyone"? Are we just anyone? Akari, Sakurako is in a different position. Not different. We're all friends. It doesn't matter when we met. Right, I agree with you. But it does matter. What do you mean? I'm okay with this. As long as it's her choice. Okay with her lies too? Did she really lie? Nothing makes sense, otherwise Jun didn't say anything. "If I say something, it'll come out wrong." You remember saying this? I agree with that. When you try to be true to yourself, it gets difficult to speak. So, forget the whole thing? - I didn't say... - I said to her, "We can't be friends if you lie to me." What's a relationship built on lies? That would be... full of lies! Akari, take it whatever way it makes you feel. Same to Sakurako and Jun. That's all. Fumi, why are you always like this? What do you mean? Put yourself first before others! How do you feel about this? In my case... I feel sad because my close friend has been lying to me. That's how we should start. You're only using your head. I would say... You're just like Jun's husband. How about you, Akari? Don't you ever think we made her hold back? We did? Maybe she thought we'd never understand her. - That's selfish. - Who's selfish now? I'm sure I won't tell you everything. You just judge people by your own standard. Who can confess anything to someone like you? What... What about you? Don't take it out on me. Mr. Toyama 10 units Can you double check these? Ah, sure. Mr. Yokota - His glucose level before meal was 242. - Check. He ate 70 percent of rice and 90 percent of sides. So, four units. Four units, checks. Mr. Toyama. His glucose level before meal was 290. He ate everything. So, 10 units, the same as last time. 10 units, check. - Mr. Hirose. - Okay. His glaucose level before meal was 189. He ate 40 percent of rice and 20 percent of sides. So I cut down to two units. - Two units. - Two units, check. - Thank you. - Sure. Ms. Makino. - Sorry. - What? What is it? I knew it. What's this? Mr. Toyama didn't eat everything. Not even half. So we must cut down two units. - I was looking at a wrong chart. - I think so. That's a great job. Thank you. I happened to visit Mr.Toyama at lunch time. - Come with me. - Yes. Why didn't you say it while double checking? You knew it, huh? I'm sorry. Don't say sorry. Just tell me why. I thought it was my mistake. It was the kind of mistake you'd never make. I almost killed him. - I'm sorry. - Don't say that. It's pointless. Is it that hard to be up front with me? Just tell me whenever I'm wrong. That's all you need to do. I'm sorry. Ah, I'm sorry. I must write a close-call report. - Do you really have to do it? - Idiot! What's in your head? What is the close-call report for? Grow up! We're dealing with people's lives. Remember that. Yes. - Bring the cart down. - Eh? I'll do it over. - That's redundant. - I don't trust you. You didn't double check properly. If you can't take it seriously, go somewhere else. You're irritating me. I'm home. Oh, you're back. What is it? - Listen. - Yeah. I gotta talk with you. About what? Well... Hmm. There's a girl I go out with. Uh-huh. And she got pregnant. Huh? I need some money. Hey, hold on. I don't get it. I need money for an abortion. "Steam" This reading event... Yes? Your husband is organizing it, right? Yes, we both rely on you. The writer, she's pretty young. I think so. - And cute. - I think so too. I've never read her books. Is she famous? I don't think she's famous. Your husband is her editor, right? Yes, I can bring you a copy if you need. Do I need to read it? It's up to you. You can talk about how you feel after the reading at the event. Thank you for waiting. It's the contract. Okay, thank you. The production is set for a year. We'll cover all the expenses. Since you have a place to stay in Kobe, the money for hotels can be extra funds. Well, do I have to stay in Kobe for one whole year? No, not really. You can go anywhere as long as you'll be here at the time of the presentation. I see. Anything else? Nope. I'm afraid to bring this up now, but I feel awkward to be called a resident artist. I begin to wonder now if I'm really an artist. Huh? I only put objects upright. Please cherish the feeling that you have now. We believe we can do something interesting with your help. But I understand we both have a right to choose. No... I'm not saying I feel awkward with you folks at PORTO. It's only the matter of my senses. Okay. We can still wait. So when you feel you're ready, please let us know. Okay, thank you. We can discuss with you if you like. Please reconsider it. Please do so. Any problem? Well, you have such a hard job. Any problem? Such an idiot. You have no friends at school? I do. Why don't you go ask them to pitch in? You're beyond an idiot. When I was young, we used to pitch in. For anyone we knew. You had sex for fun, huh? When she gets pregnant... you just ask us for money? Do you think that's okay? Hell no! She uh... Huh? ...doesn't wanna tell anybody. - You must mind her body first! - Stop it. - It hurts. - You know... what comes after what, huh? What's her name? Tell us her name. Now. We must go apologize. Just pay the cost? Things don't work that way! Yuki Misawa. Yuki Misawa is... You know her? ...from the same elementary school. I see. Go to bed now. What do we do? All we can do is to offer them our sincere apology. I'll call them tomorrow. When can you go? Not for two weeks. Weekend either? Next year, Kobe will host the Port City World Summit. The VIPs are here now. But three weeks after is too late. Yeah. Can you go? By myself? 20 people. For 10 days. I'm in charge of them all day. I can't tell my schedule. Impossible. Didn't I tell you? No, you didn't. You told me you'd be busy, but didn't tell me why. Go take some money out. How much? 500,000. A letter... I'll write it tonight. But it would mean nothing unless you meet in person So then, can you take my place and make money? You can't, right? But you can take care of family affairs for me. So, please. Can you get me some tea? Please accept our deepest apology. We can't find any other words. - Sakurako. - Yes. I understand it doesn't amend anything, but please kindly accept this. Can you promise us that you won't let him see her again? Do you mean he has to transfer? I mean outside the school. Entrance exams are coming up. It's their crucial time. I'll make sure he won't see her again. Again, our deepest apology. It's so absurd. They're equally in love. But we're the ones who had to apologize? They never gave a word of apology. Right. I wonder how they'd have reacted if I'd said, "Your girl seduced Daiki." I'm sorry... Huh? ...about him. He's somewhat short with words. You mean Daiki? No, I mean Yoshihiko. Oh. Maybe... Daiki takes after his father in having such a nature. I guess so. Sakurako, you're too serious. Huh? There are things you can't help? But you blame yourself for everything. That's somewhat... arrogant in a way. Arrogant? That sort of mentality wears other people down, you know. Yes Just take it easy. Be easygoing. That's the best. I thought I was easygoing. Yoshihiko's sister gave me a call. Yes. She said sorry to me.. I knew she would regret it soon. So I'm going back to her place this weekend. Are you sure? You must be happy now. Not true. Please take good care of Yoshihiko. Oh, please don't. We did this before, didn't we? Maybe, it's not so easy to stay together with someone you really like. Arranged marriages like mine might be easier. I just had to stick to it. Our marriage... Huh? How do you see it? Sustaining a marriage is hard. And so is leaving it. If it's hard either way, then isn't it better to sustain it? I'll take a walk now. It's my last chance to do so before I leave. Okay. Thank you so much. Not at all Yuki... Was she there? She was there, but didn't come out. I got a glimpse of her in upstairs I see. She's cute. I'm sorry I hit you. I have to say sorry too. Nothing can undo what you did. Yeah. So you must live with it. Maybe... you can never be happy the rest of your life. Oh, I said an awful thing. Do you think your dad and I are mature? Actually, we're not. And you're mature than we think. Okay. So, you can't depend too much on us anymore. You started dating Dad when you two were in junior high, right? Who confessed love first? I don't remember. That can't be true. Well, we were taken in by Jun's smooth talk. Jun? How? She told Yoshihiko I liked him. But also she told me he liked me. Well... She is such a meddler. I guess so. Your friends use the word, "Meddler"? I don't know. But I use it. Won't you pick it up? Hello. I'm sorry. I stayed at hospital for only one day. Sorry what I wrote made you worry. Yes, I'm totally fine now. That's not true. Right now, I'm on my way home. That's okay. It's late now. I'll be fine. Well... I guess I can finally go out with Suzuka now. I'll walk you to upstairs. Do I have to make tea for you? If you insist, I'll be your guest. Don't do anything stupid, okay? No way, you moron. You'd get a parking ticket if you did. I'll make tea for you instead. So, get some rest. "Steam" Akari, do you go to reading events? Hey, stop snooping around. You're quite feminine, huh? Shut up. Go home now! Don't get closer. That's mean. Go home. I can't do doctors. I told you so. I know how you feel. I can't do nurses anymore either. Then, you can't do me. - Hey. - Akari. Hey! Ouch! Are you okay? Ouch. Daiki. Jun. What are you doing? What? Getting on the ferry? Nope. Seeing someone off? Well... What? You have a baby in there? Yep, that's right. Wanna touch it? Is it kicking? I dunno. Wanna listen to it? What? Kinda embarrassing. Come on. It's a rare occasion. It's moving. Yep. I gotta go. I'll see you off. Oh yeah? I'm glad. Thank you. Thanks a lot No prob. I'm glad I came Yeah? What brought you here? I was gonna elope with my girl. But she stood me up. Uh-huh. It seems I'm jilted. Your expression sounds archaic. I get that a lot. Don't tell my mom. Of cource. - Thanks. - Yep. Take care of yourself. - Jun. - Yeah? I heard... I was born because of you. That's right. Thank you. Bye bye. Daiki? What do you want for dinner? I'm coming in. Hello. I didn't reserve a spot. That's fine. Is Akari here? Thank you for coming to the reading of Kozue Nose's new work. I'm Takuya Tsukamoto, her editor in charge. I'll be emceeing today's event. Ms. Nose will be reading from her unpublished work with a current working title "Steam." It's scheduled to be published next year. Um... Ms. Nose is trying something new by writing series of short stories set in hot springs all over Japan. Artist Mr. Kei Ukai will be hosting a Q&A after the reading. Please welcome Ms. Kozue Nose. Good evening. I'm Nose. Although they've prepared me with a microphone, I'll be reading without it. I hope you like it. "Steam." I knew it because I couldn't stop looking. It was as if my eyes fell for him first. That's why I still remember clearly the Pocari blue of Shimada's T-shirt from a year ago. I'm remembering for the first time in a while his blue T-shirt and slightly nasal voice. It's because I'll be seeing him today? Outside the window, lush leaves follow us and move from right to left of a window frame. All I can see outside is the green, and I'm not sure where I am. I feel like summer plays up all sorts of things. The scenery flashes by. Slowly, the landscape outside becomes nonparallel to the window frame. My body feels heavy on the left as I look out. The train is climbing the hill. I transfer at the next stop. Then, it's one stop to my destination. The train slowly takes a corner, and I see a black hole ahead. A rail track shoots to the hole with greenery on both sides. It's such a clean straight line that I wonder if there's a way back. Without much change, the end of the scenery comes closer and then passes by me. I just watch that repeat. Among the train's clickety-clacks, I hear the kettle like sound of the whistling wind. We enter a tunnel. Like an explorer with a headlamp, the train only lights up a small area ahead. Inside the tunnel undulates in brown like the back of a throat. After a while, I see white light ahead. As we approach it, brown, green, and blue come into sight and form a scenery. Looking at that, I suddenly understood that humans saw the world through light Actually, it surprised me that such realization just hit me right then. The end of the tunnel nears and we come out. We're at Arima Hot Springs. I saw Akane as I exited through the ticket gate. There were other researchers, and I saw Shimada among them. His T-shirt wasn't blue but white today. "Yayoi-chan!" Akane waves with a smile. I wave back. We're classmates in college, but she's a year older. I call her Akane-san, and she calls me Yayoi-chan. I use "san" to show my respect, which disappoints her since we're classmates. But I like it because we sound like an old married couple. I'm not studying geology. But Akane invited me again this year, so I decided to join them. We're staying at Arima for a few days to study the faults. "Good morning. Thanks for having me again." I addressed the whole group on purpose. I looked back and found our leader Professor Ogata. We probably took the same train, but he was just exiting the gate. Shimada is a fast walker. He's faster than I am. And faster than most people, most of the time. That's why I'm usually looking at his back. That's okay because our eyes are placed in front of us. Besides, watching him walk can be quite interesting. His body hops up when he takes a step, moving his shoulders a lot. His walking style makes him look happy even if he isn't. Hopefully, it won't work against him. I hear a fault research is all about walking. The detective-like idea made me laugh last year. Fumi. Let's get outta here. You and I. What are you talking about? Is it weird to ask? Not going back in? I'll use the bathroom. Oh. Hey, you. You look good. What happened? Nothing really. You still came. I thought I'd run into... Who? You. Aren't you adorable today. I'm kidding. How's the reading? It's going. You're not listening? Akari... Huh? Let's get outta here. What? You and I. I went to the bath hall a bit later. A fairly small space was full of people. I was surprised at how crowded it was. But strangely, several shower stalls were open. I thought about looking for Akane, but I didn't want to stare at naked people. I chose a stall with nobody on either side and scurried over. I tried to keep my body movements to a minimum while I quickly washed my hair and my body. I couldn't see through the brown bath water, so I used my feet to feel the steps to enter. Being careful not to bump my little toes, I moved quite slowly. Be fitting the name "golden bath," fine gold particles floated in the tub. I enjoyed the soak unlike the bath at home and watched the particles. They reminded me of an old soup stock cube that didn't dissolve completely. I placed a folded towel on my head and lowered my body. I took a breath and looked up. The ceiling continued past a wall, which separated women's bath from men's that existed in a same space. I heard voices from men's bath, but they were in Chinese and I didn't understand. I decided that's why it was noisier in here than how it looked. Will you look at this? I'm not the right person for the Q&A. Can't be your resident artist, either He's not answering his phone. Show it to Takuya. ...a person I'd never met. It amazed me that all of them were naked together at the hot spring. Did you get through? No. I called him many times. What shall we do? We have to tell them. I don't think we can. We'll embarrass Ms. Nose. You're right. But it's unavoidable. Ukai won't be back. You sound so detached. Can you do it? What? The Q&A. With Ms. Nose. You're the curator, so it'll make sense. No. What? I don't want to. I haven't been really listening, it'll be rude. Okay. Are you okay? Later, Shimada came by the coffee shop. He sat next to us and was talking to Akane about today's field work. "When are you marrying your girlfriend?" Akane asked him. "Probably when I save up more." Shimada answered. I already knew that he had a girlfriend and that they would probably get married. So, I didn't look surprised nor pay much attention. I watched a horse race replaying in slow motion. When I left, I realized how shallow my breath had been. I breathed deeply in and out. The night wind felt cooler than earlier. Maybe it was because my body got warm from the bath. I could still taste the acidity of coffee. They're open. Wanna go? Okay, sure. What? You look great today. You're sure about this? I am. Oh, yeah? How about you? What? You're missing the event. Yeah. Jun's not there, right? No. Okay, then. I'm good. I returned to my room and lay down. Looking at the ceiling, I thought about what happened earlier.. I thought I was relieved I didn't tell him my feelings, but that wasn't it. And it wasn't that I was regretting it, either. Without falling in love, I didn't feel the need to touch the joy of being next to Shimada's daily life. Maybe I couldn't feel the need. Perhaps at the time, I just wanted to do something to surprise Shimada. But then, I couldn't figure out why I was looking at Shimada. Keeping my eyes open didn't feel helpful, so I closed my eyes. But nothing changed. I woke up early next morning, and decided to take another bath. I still had time before the check-out. The bath hall was quiet. Plenty of people were already there, but the quiet atmosphere remained in the changing room and the bath room I was able to take my time disrobing and slowly washed my body. All sorts of naked bodies walked in as I soaked in the bathtub. A short child, a tall adult, and a short adult. Pale skin, tanned skin, large breasts, small breasts, skinny legs, fat legs, a wrinkly neck, a big belly, a large beauty mark, and grizzled hair. You notice various colors and shapes in diverse bodies when you're naked. These bodies belong to different people But when they all gather, you realize how our bodies are just the combinations of various body parts. Had I been a daughter of a butcher and lived near the ocean, I would have... would I have been the girl with a chubby tummy and tanned skin? All I saw in front of me were those different possibilities. Are those choices yet to be made, or have they been made? Are the choices made now or in the past? These bodies are mingling and doing their own thing. They enter the tub through white steam, wash their bodies, and walk around. Surrounded by these bodies, I felt I could like myself more. Although my knee is bent, it remembers my 22 years much better than I can. This knee is mine. That's how I feel now. I was getting dizzy, so I got out of the tub. My body felt lighter. The notion of my own body and my actual body finally matched in shape and content. Everyone wanted to stay longer and shop for souvenirs, but I went ahead alone and got on a train home. The scenery from my trip here replayed backwards. Touching the back of my neck, I could feel my body starting to cool off from my spine. A baby started to cry. The ripping sound echoed throughout the train. The mother was trying to calm the baby But I wanted the baby to cry more. I wanted to praise the baby's loud voice. I began to feel anxious in the back of my throat and in my back. So, I clenched my jaw. I was thinking about Shimada. A ray of sun was falling on the floor. I wanted to keep it all. This body of mine, the baby's cry, the train and the scenery... Save them in a plastic container. Many thanks. We'll move on to the Q&A now. I'm sorry, but we've had to change our lineup. Artist, Kei Ukai, has been taken ill and had to withdraw. But we have one of our attendees, biologist, Kohei Hino, here to take Ukai's place. Thank you Mr. Hino. Please give him a hand. Nice to see you. It's been a while. Hello, and thanks for filling in. I'm not sure how to begin... Yes, of course, I understand. The book isn't out yet? No, the ink's still wet on my manuscript. - Not dry yet. - No. It's part of a series with a hot spring theme. I see. Hot springs like Atami and Beppu. And Arima near here in Kobe. So they're still to come? That's right. I don't think I've said who I am yet, have I? I I was introduced as a biologist, but my field is fertilized egg development Yes. I had heard that. Right. What kind of research do you do? Well... Put simply, I observe fertilized egg cell division, and how cells acquire functions. I see. We all know we have arms here, and legs here. And organs in our abdomen. We take it for granted. But should we? Why don't our hands or heads grow from our bellies? I'm studying when and how these functions are decided. I see. Currently, we only know that it is ultimately programmed in our DNA. Evolution showed that our four limbs worked best in this form and so here we are with that DNA. That's all we know. Right. But when and where do cells take on a role as they divide? It's a key question. When an arm becomes an arm, or a leg a leg. From what was once just an egg. Can an arm cell replace a leg cell? If so, in what cell process is that possible? Ah. Is it hard to follow? No, but I might be lying if I say I understand. It is difficult, I know. But it becomes false if I oversimplify. Yes. Putting it at its simplest, I scrutinize how things happen. Now I remember that I've heard you explain this before. That's right. With the same response. I m sorry. I'm sorry. But then... what you do is not so different to my work. I think that's what you said then, too. I'm sorry. No, I agree with you. Really? May I talk about how good your story is? Sure. I think it's great. Thank you. It was new for me to approach literature through voice. The main character is Yayoi, a woman in her 20's like you. It's her first person narrative. Yes. It's embarrassing, but I felt like I had become a woman as I listened. Really? Yes, honestly. How embarrassing. No, I'm really pleased. Women are always a mystery to me. I see. But I felt like I had become one. But it hasn't solved the mystery. I really felt how women perceive their own bodies as a mystery. It's thanks to your vivid portrayal. Your ability to see. Oh? You open with visual descriptions. One of a train. Yes, Arima Railway. I thought it symbolized the whole work. Things often just pass our eyes by. But your eyes don't try to catch those fleeting events. They depict them as something fleeting. I thought that was terrific. It isn't in slow-motion. It's our realitime, the world as it is. But you show how sensitively that can bedone if you try. Put simply, it's beautiful. It spurs us to live life. That's my reading of it. Wow. That's great. Did you visit Arima? Yes, I did. I thought so. Naturally. So the story is based on what you felt there? That's right. The train and hot spring are much like I experienced them. The characters are fiction. I'm not so sure about that. Ha ha. Why is that? It's related to the other strength of this work. How minutely you have documented your own perceptions. From vision to perception. Thats unique to this work. Really? So many things pass by Yayoi's eyes. But they still have an impact on her. Yes. I felt this seemingly calm story was really very dynamic. Because Yayoi undergoes such a radical change. She affirms the bent knee she was ashamed of. Through seeing. Yes. Listening to you reading, readers, or rather listeners, could take on Yayoi's body. They could enter her senses. I'm pleased. Thank you. It was almost like being in the Women's section of a bathhouse. Right. It really was. It was a first for me. I'd be worried if it wasn't. Listening to you yourself read the story was even more fascinating. It was like you, Yayoi, and all of us merged together in this space. It was a happy moment. Really? Excuse me. I've done all the talking. When we all came to hear you. No, really. Thank you. Do you have any comments in response? No, I'm just grateful. But... Yes. If people equate me with Yayoi san, I must object and say that is not the case. Although it's a fine balance. Yes. I shouldn't use "san" for my characters, but it's my habit. Okay. I did invest Yayoi san with many of my own feelings. Yes. But I have to be Akane san, for example. I'm not a multi-role player, but with multiple characters, have to make them all real. Right. I have to be Akane san, and Shimada san, and Prof. Ogata, too. Right. But if they're all me, then it's completely boring. I really like this world. It has its bad sides. I'm not enlightened enough to include those, too. But altogether, I like it. I see. So I don't want to demean it in my work. Right. There's the fact that the world's a lot bigger than me, of course. But it's also only me writing. Yes. So how do I represent the world, and not just myself? Yes. In fact, I make myself as small as I can. I become tiny and ignorant. Yayoi san represents me. I see. What she doesn't know, I don't know. Yes. What occurs is so minor you can't call them events. But for her, all of them are sudden, and surprising. So I am there with her in every response Like emerging from a tunnel. I see. Staying one body, I wanted to make her arrive somewhere else. I think you did that. And we joined in that journey. Thank you. That's right. But... You have a but... No, that's it from me. Oh! I'll talk too much again. No, please go ahead? May I take questions from the floor? Yes, fine. Any questions? I'd like to hear your views. Please go ahead. The story is of a full day from one morning to the next. And you evoke so well the unsteady shifts in a woman's feelings as they emerge over that one day. What we heard you read just now, was that just a part of the book? Yes, well... It's one in a set of short stories. In that case, I felt a little bit unsatisfied. I wished she had been more proactive. But I thought it expressed a woman's feelings very well. Thank you! - So you rooted for Yayoi san's romance? - Yes. I'm grateful. That's great. I haven't been to many book readings. You kept a very low tone, without showing much emotion as you read. Was that a conscious choice you made? Yes, I guess I wasn't reading because I wanted listeners to listen. Not really. If I read to be listened to, that doesn't seem right somehow. I felt after reading today, that I wrote this, and know everything as I'm reading it. But as I read, a character would pop up suddenly, and then speak. I had unexpected new encounters. So I want to pass the text on as it is. Without changing my inflection or raising my voice in dramatic parts the words should still reach everyone. With the same impact, as well. That's why I kept it contained. How are we for time? I'm afraid that's all we have time for. - Thank you very much. - Thank you. Thank you very much. Please also help us by completing our survey. Thank you. You saved us. Not at all. Was it acceptable? I thought it was great. Thanks. I'll pass that on. I've had some news of Jun. It seems she's well, at least. Don't worry. So you... Kohei Thanks for the favor. Was it okay? You saved us. Being the host, too. I'm glad I could help. Jun didn't come in the end? You didn't come together? No. She wanted to come. Really? Care to join us for dinner after this? Dinner? It seemed like you had more to say to Ms. Nose. Oh, it wasn't important. Do join us. Will you come, too? If I'm not intruding. I'll join you then. Great. I'll be back soon. I'll wait outside. See you later. Could we get through? It's like I've got two heads! That's rough. Do you come here a lot? When I lived here in Kobe I did. What about you? I haven't been here for 15 years. When I partied. Partied? I feel like a time traveler. You seem... What? You seem a bit down. Before I was great. I meant both. How can you be down and great? It's your voice. What voice? Like you're walking naked. How's that sound? It sounds gorgeous. I don't know. Maybe it's because I met you. Thanks. Like this to all the girls? - Oh. - Hey. How rude. Hello. Welcome. Hi. Isn't the event on? I escaped. I knew it! Ha ha. It's not funny. Stop running away. Right. You bother everyone. I know. Kawano has work to do, so he won't be coming. Right. And he says he's really sorry. It's not for him to apologize. He's Ukai's contact. Tell him not to worry about it. Okay. It went extremely well in the end. Thanks to you, Kohei. No problem. Um... Yes. Why did Mr. Ukai leave? I don't know. I see. Don't worry about it. He's like that. Like that? That's all I know. I don't think it's related to your book. So this happens? Yes, it does. - Sakurako. - Yes. - Any comments on tonight? - Oh. As Ms. Nose is right here. Yes, please. Well... It's natural as you're a writer, I guess, but we feel the same thing so differently. The same thing? I just visited Arima, too. I went to the golden bath, and walked the slopes... Yes. You said the strength of Kozue's work was she doesn't try to capture things that pass by our eyes. Yes. Let alone capture things, I feel like I don't even see them. I don't see anything. Don't feel anything. It made me feel a bit depressed. That's not really about your work. That's fine. But I felt like that because your story was so good. It was like you tapped my shoulder to pass on the things I had missed. To show me how good they were. Really? So thank you. Not at all. Thank you. Would you mind too, Fumi? Yes, would you? Ah. I'm sorry I used your first name. Oh, that's fine. But I'm sorry. I was in and out and didn't hear it all properly. I'm really sorry. No, you had to work. Yes, but still. Yes. I thought you had a lovely reading voice. Wow. It's a shame I couldn't hear it to the end. I'm sorry. No. Thank you. This is no good. Why's that? If it's all positive, it isn't very useful for her. How about you, Kohei? You had something else to say, didn't you? No, I thought it was a great story. That was my first comment. Thank you. What's the second? Well. Yes. I'm just an amateur, so I can only comment as one. Okay. The main character, Yayoi. Yes. She doesn't really love anyone, does she? At least that's what I felt. Shimada isn't really important to her at all. Where did you feel that? If you're really in love, Yes. You can't hide it away inside yourself If you really want someone, an unknown you rips through and appears from your old self. And I thought Yayoi, the main character didn't really love Shimada, the male character. So you're saying that maybe I the writer haven't ever really fallen in love with anyone. Characters are not the author. You yourself said so, and I understand that. But your work aims to transplant your physical senses into your text, accurately and faithfully. The limits in the writer's perception can become the limits of the world shown in the work. Because the writer doesn't know how it feels to be in love. Yes. So her world is narrow? I thought so. Doing anything to grasp what you see passing by. Trying even when it's futile. I didn't find that emotion in your stoiy. As far as I can see, the world is much crueler. Like wind blowing through trees, the most precious things can suddenly be stolen away. Yes. Writing that reproduces the world's cruelty. I just realized that that is what I want to read. I think writers Yes. Should never write in response to orders from their readers. Yes. However immature they are, writers must build their work with their own knowledge of the world. If they don't, they have no roots. They can't grow. Yes. I like her work. As her editor, perhaps I shouldn't say this. Go on. What I trust most in her is that she doesn't dive on into defined themes like the "cruel world." She depicts the world as she sees it That is at her roots. She might not know about a whole lot of things. But if your cruel world ever appears in front of her, Ms. Nose will write it as it is. I look forward to that. So do I. Sorry I butted in. Not at all. This amateur made stupid comments Not at all. Thank you. But it's a shock. I'm sorry. It's okay. That "love" was something I felt confident about. I'm not sure what to do if it isn't true. I don't know. You're still maturing. Maturing? You'll suddenly realize what kind of person you are. Is your wife the person you really love, Mr. Hino? Yes. That's great. No, we were just in divorce court. Yes. It's not good. And now? I won the case. We're still a couple. Can love be so selfish? So one-sided? No thought for your partner? Haven't you ever considered Jun's perspective. Kohei? I clearly can't become Jun. So I can't adopt her perspective. That's not what I mean. Your Q&A with Kozue was great. You seemed to understand, be able to talk about feelings. It makes me even angrier. Why didn't you listen more to Jun? I'm trying to do that now. I don't understand her. I want to hear from her directly. Is that wrong? Isn't it too late? Maybe so. But we couldn't have talked without the court case. I realize it now. I need her in my life. Otherwise, it's meaningless. I never thought I could say these kinds of things. The court did it. It was the deepest communication we've ever had in our marriage. I felt like I encountered her soul for the first time, that I met Jun for the first time. She's a passionate, intelligent, beautiful woman. I fell in love with her. If you say you're in love with her, what will you do now? I'll look for her. How? Like an investigator. If you're persistent, anyone can do it So, it's best if I do it myself. What about your job? I quit the other day. And money? I have savings. When they go? I'll work as I need to. I have a question for you. I didn't know this man's identity. I realized who he was from the flyer. He should know where Jun is. Where's Kazama and others? They went to a concert. That sounds good. Did you get injured? Yeah, I fell down the stairs at work. How? Feeing out of it? Yeah, I guess I was. Please be careful. You're irreplaceable, you know? Nah, I doubt that. You've got many patients. Well, yeah. Many people are counting on you. Still, I wouldn't say I'm irreplaceable. The younger nurses are more popular Not about that. You seem reliable at work. Only at work... Sorry. Any drink for you? I'll have a Rum and Coke. Gin and tonic. Coming up. You used to come here a lot. Huh? So it was Hinako's bar. It's not really hers. She just works here. Do I look stupid? What do you mean? I'd have walked out by now. Lucky me. What are you doing? You just gonna walk away? What are you saying? If you want it, grab it. Nothing will change. Who are you to tell me that? Hey, got a light? Thanks. You're underage, aren't you? When was this taken? Right before Jun left. I first thought she was dating Mr. Ukai in the photo, but she wasn't. What makes you believe Ukai knows where she is? I looked into her call logs. Isn't that illegal? No, the law allows husbands to do that. After she met Mr. Ukai, she started to call a women's shelter in Tohoku. A shelter? It's for women who can't divorce their husbands. I think Mr. Ukai arranged the place for her to stay. So, she is in Tohoku now? Not necessarily. She could be anywhere. It's a nationwide organization. And, they won't disclose her information once she's in So, is she safe now? I'm sure she's been well taken care of. What are you going to do if you can reach Ukai? It's not that I'd take violent action. I'd just have a talk with him. Luckily, he might know something about her. I don't really know him and I'm not sure if I'll contact him. I see. If I can get in touch with him, I'll tell him about you. I'd appreciate it. If that was why you are here for, would you leave for now? No problem. Wait there. What it is? I'm sure you have your reasons, but he's our guest tonight. Don't do that. Then, I'll leave. No, I'll leave. No, I will. Let me ask you before I go. Sure. Do you understand that she doesn't love you? I do. And she never will. Okay. She'll keep on running away until you stop. Isn't it bad for both of you? Is it? Stop holding on to her. That'll be the only way to bring her back. She may not go back to you. But at least, let us have her back. Do you mind? I want to say one thing. Go ahead. I don't know the whole story, but it sounds a little unfair. What do you mean? I understand you two are concerned about your friend. But, it still seems wrong to speak for her in her absence. Kohei, on the other hand, uses his words only for himself. That sounds fair. But, you two seems a little... Are you sure that it's all for Jun? What do you mean? I feel that you are speaking for yourselves, not for her. It seemed like you are using her. But, just like Kohei said, nothing will be settled unless Jun faces him. He will never able to accept it without that. It's not your place to say such things. You know nothing. You're right. I apologize. Stop. Let's call it a night. Sure. No, I'll just leave. Ms. Nose, I am sorry if I ruined your night. It's okay. Fumi, Yes. I know she keeps on running away as long as I keep going after her. Yes. She won't come back to me. And she'll never love me. I know that already. A living hell awaits. But, I'm fine with that. Because I know what makes me happy. It's the only way, and I must go along with it. I'll excuse myself. Please get in touch with Mr. Ukai. You'll miss your train, Ms. Nose. I'll drive you home. Fumi and Sakurako, too. No, I'll take a train home. Why are you so angry today? Don't you think it's rude to her? You really don't know? You really don't know why she's angry? Haven't you ever considered what she's been holding back? Please just go home with her. Well, that... It's not your place to say such things. Fumi will tell me if she needs to. You'll miss your train. Tonight was all my fault. I can't leave Ms. Nose here. Not going after her? Where's my brother? What? Can I leave his drink here? What's your family name? It's Ukai. What it is? Leave it here. Where is he? I don't know. Maybe he left already. That's possible. You should drink that if you want. What kind of man is he? Who's he...? Your brother! What does he want? He doesn't want to show. Show what? That he's empty inside. So, you know that? Know what? His inside. No, but it makes a good sound when I hit his head. So, I believe it's empty inside. You two are strange. What's strange about us? Everything. I have a brother, but we're not like you. What's so different? You're too close for brother and sister. I know. We're often mistaken as a couple. I bet you are. Don't you hang out with your brother? No. He has no interest in me, and I have no interest in him. We're just happened to be born into the same house. I feel the same way. We're just two different people. You don't act like it. I see. He still can't let his sister go. Does he have to? Huh? Why is it better to let me go than staying close? I don't mind if you are fine with it. I asked you why? Because you won't be happy. How come? Nobody can come in between you two, if you keep staying so close. You can't stay with him forever. Can't we stay together forever? Like I said, I don't mind if you are fine with it. I don't care about your relationship with him. You're getting irritated with me? I am. I see. Do you like my brother? Like him? Do I like Ukai? Do l...? Do I look like I do? Yes, you do. I don't fall in love that easily. Oh, I see. But, I admit that I'm interested in him. When does that turn into love? When I know him better. What do you need to fall in love with him? Dates, I think. I can leave you two alone. Don't worry. Do you fall in love if you have sex? It's hard to know the right timing for it. How is it hard? Sex could tell you a lot about a guy, but it's a long way to get there. Is it? Isn't it for you? Not for me. Let me ask you then. Can you have sex with anybody? I have my criterion. What is it? His face. That's very simple. It is, but I don't think it's wrong. Because your life shows in your face. I think my brother has a good face. Do you fall in love? Yes, I do. How do you feel when you do? I want him to love me. Again, very simple. You are not simple? I used to be very simple... I know I need a man. I know that. See, I enjoy talking with you like this. you know? It makes me happy to get to know you, but it doesn't make my heart skip a beat. You're right. In the end, it doesn't matter how stupid or how bad he is. I feel like I'd forget that I am a woman if I don't have a man. Do you forget that? I realized I have forgotten. So, now you remembered? I had sex with two men this week. Does that happen often? Not often... Actually, never. Were they good? I don't know how to put it. They both treated me nicely, but I didn't feel right. What was wrong? Perhaps... it'd have been better if I had sex with a stranger. But... I can't do that. Scared? Have you done it? With a complete stranger? You have. I have. Where do you meet? A place like this. Any dangerous experience? Well, it can be dangerous to begin with ls your life boring? You don't feel alive, right? How about you? I need to stay sharp, so I feel tense every day working as a nurse. I see. Of course, you'd feel less tense as you're getting used to the job. But, if you're too relaxed, you'd make a mistake. That means I'll never feel completely relaxed as long as I'm a nurse. I see. So, I'm not looking for all the excitement from sex. It's more like... I'd rather feel safe. I wish I could just melt like butter, and forget who I am when I have sex. So, I guess sex could be dangerous. Still, I can't do it unless I know I can trust him enough. Trust him? Yeah, so I can let myself out. And I know there will be a part of me that I'm most afraid to show anyone. Yeah. What am I gonna do? What are you doing? Help me. I need your help. Just for tonight. Maybe I can help you, too. My head is fuzzy. I'm embarrassed. Why? I don't like talking to smart people. Too fast. Now I know Akari always stood up for us You're right. So true. Fumi, Fumi, What? Just calling. It's a pretty name. Thanks. You see... I don't like your husband. I couldn't stand him. Sorry. Why are you apologizing? Thanks for being angry That's not it. I just wanted to be noticed. By your husband? I don't know. Then by who? The thing is... We haven't had sex in a long time. But, it's not just that. Yeah. I wanna be noticed, and be understood... But I don't know who I wanna be noticed by and what to be understood. Do you like Takuya? You do, right? I don't know. It's complicated. So, do you like Yoshihiko? I've never even thought about it before. Still... I love him. Oh. Got a minute? Please stand clear of the closing doors. Sorry about today. What do you mean? Sorry. Fumi hadn't mentioned anything before? No, nothing at all. You don't... Huh? ...talk to her much? I thought I did, but... But? Maybe not about the important things. Not talking about important things keeps the relationship interesting. You're not helping. So you love her anyway. Of course I do. Do you truly? That doesn't matter. Is that so? There's no point in doubting. Oh... If that's how I feel, then it's true. Well then. What? I have feelings for you. Seriously? I'm serious. You're serious... I'm in love with you. You mean it. Oh, red light. Oh well, let me make a stop. Sure. I don't want to die yet. I'm home. Oh, hey. Just got home? Yeah. I see. Where were you? I walked from Ashiya. That's a long way. It was. What about you? I was with Ms. Nose. I see. We talked and I drove her back home. Where are you? At a diner. That's all. Nothing happened. How? You stayed with her all night. She told me she likes me. That's nothing? I couldn't leave her alone. You like her too, don't you? I hated your voice when you talked about her. My voice...? You sounded happy. I didn't mean it. So, this is it. Huh? I've been thinking of how we'd end up. End up? This was one of the scenarios I did see coming. What else? Got another one? You'd be here when I come home. And you'd apologize, saying you've never realized how much you've been hurting me. And, you'd swear you'll never hurt me again. Then, I'd say to you. "It's too late." I want a divorce. Let's end it now. Does it really have to be this way? No chance for us? I won't work with Ms. Nose anymore. Don't get me wrong. What? Keep your job. I loved you when you talked about your job, so it hurt me even more. "Loved" You had your chances... so many times But you missed all. I did...? You did. I guess I did. Will you go outside while I pack my stuff? I'm sorry but I can't be here with you. Oh. I know we have to get a divorce. But, you're wonderful. I've never even realized that I've been hurting you. I'm sorry. Stop it. I just wanted to say It was wrong that you had to get hurt. Bye. I'm home. Is it gonna rain today? I don't know. I'm just taking them in. Where is Daiki? Probably at school. Before breakfast? Where were you? What were you doing? I was with a guy. Do you mean... I had sex. Do you like him? It's not like that. That's worse. But, I'm grateful for him. I really am. It hurts. It hurts. What do you wanna do? What should I do? I'll leave anytime if you want. But, I won't apologize. Are you going to that guy if I kick you out? I don't even know his number. I don't get it. Of course you don't. Why would you say that? That's how I feel. I don't know if I can forgive you. - "Forgive." - I'm not sure. I wish I could... but, I can't apologize. I really can't, so I won't. Was it my fault then? Don't give me that look. What look? Like that. I'm just looking. I can't kick you out. Why? Because I care. I care for you guys. I might have done it wrong. But this is my way. And the only way I know. Same for me. This is my way. I won't leave but I won't apologize. And I won't ask for your forgiveness. Disappointed? I need to go. Okay. Are you okay? Yeah. Are you sure? Have a good day. Good morning. Good morning. What brings you here today? I'm taking back my sick leave. I could just do paper work for a while. Chief is not in yet. Not yet. She said she'll come around noon. Okay. Then I'll take a nap. Wake me up. Ms. Makino, I'm sorry. For what? I'm sorry that I'm unreliable. I'm sorry I can't let you rest when you're injured, and I'm sorry I'm relieved to hear you're back. Yuzuki, you have a habit of saying sorry too often. Yes. Don't say it if you don't mean it. I'm sorry. Oh... But, I mean it. Well, how I feel is a little different. How? Thank you. I'm happy that you're here Sorry. That's okay. Wow, you really are soft. Never mind. Anything new? We had a car accident victim at ER. I see. Night shift? Wow, look at you. Long night huh? How did it go? We did everything we could. That's a given. And? You tried... Fumi. Thanks. Wow, look at the view. Isn't it great? Our patients love it. The key... I handed him the car key. He forgot to take it when he left, I handed him. Thanks, but I'm okay. No, you're not okay. That's not it. The more I think about it, I don't know what we could've done differently. So, I won't blame myself for what happened. Okay. I'm even happy somehow. I feel like we still have a chance. Crazy, huh? When he wakes up, I'll tell him, "Serves you right!" Scary? Not to me, but I'm not sure how he'd feel. Can I go downstairs? Sure. I wanna be there when he wakes up. Are you okay alone? Don't worry about me. Fumi, I'll be friends with Sakurako again. I'll apologize. I want us to go on a trip again if Jun returns. Yeah. We'll make Takuya do all the work, huh? Yeah.
