I did talk to Dr. Renuka. I talked to her about the present condition. They have started from there. What treatment are you going to give next? Ameer… The treatment is going on. But the patient’s body is not responding. There’s only 20 to 25 percent hope. The rest is in God’s hands. We’ll see. Is Shadhika’s mother comes, ask her to meet me. And we should question Dr. Renuka. Ok, sure. Ok. Sir… Pratapan Sir from Kerala called now. Shadhika’s mother is coming over. They also mentioned one more thing. They got the complete details of the travels. Ok. Ameer… Most probably we will have to meet tomorrow morning too. Is it personal? No, no. Then…? It’s related to the case. One more test report has to come. We will get it today. That’s why I said we need to meet tomorrow. Ok. We will meet up. Hey Sam… Come on man. I went to the hospital. She isn’t dead. There are no chances she would die. If she says something about us, Then our lives are gone. Who? Police? No one will catch us. I saw DSP Ameer at the hospital. Till then I wasn’t scared But once I saw him, My fear increased. I did tell you that, We would cut her into pieces and then bury her. Hey… I will stop, But they won’t. Hey, why are you dying of fear? Be brave. You should have guts. If he questions her, Then we shall kill them both in the hospital. I will do it man. Brother… I’m feeling so scared brother. Why are you getting scared for this small matter? In the beginning, even I too was scared. It’s your first time right? But still brother… I seriously doubt Renjan, brother. Why do you doubt him? It’s not that brother. Just thought if the police find us… I’m feeling so scared. I came just because you called me. Ok, just leave it. Have you been waiting so long for me? Just for 5 minutes. I usually don’t come here. I came just because of you. Sorry, because you waited just for me. That’s ok dear. Shadhika’s health condition is really worse. Why is this society like this? When we see the newspapers and TV, Crimes against women are increasing. Even a 5 year old child… We are hearing plenty of incidents. All that time, we never knew the pain, When we see the victim close by… What an innocent girl is Shadhika… She came to Chennai, especially to see me… I can understand your feelings. The investigation is going on. Soon I will catch that culprit. It’s understood from the medical report that, 3 people have raped her brutally. An abortion has happened too. Bleeding hasn’t stopped yet. She’s infected too. To recover from all this And survive is indeed a doubt. I really feel sorry for that girl. But you know what… Ameer, Miracles do happen. And there are chances for her survival. But one percent… But you know what Ameer… In this entire case, There is something suspicious. Suspicious…? What do you mean? Madam, they asked you to come in. Lekshmi sister, come on. Stand up. I’m not coming. You better go talk. Come on, Lekshmi sister. No dear, I can’t. You go and come. Go Renu Little flower, you are a color palette. You are a bridge of love that has come to earth. I live because of you. In this precious life forever… You blow like a cool breeze, And turn into my breathe. When you sleep on my lap, It becomes heaven Yeah, it may take some time. Where is Lekshmi sister? Nurse, a lady was here right? Where did she go? She was here madam, don’t know where she went. Doctor, she asked for the ICU and went that way. Oh, Thank you. Come. Mother… Doctor… I need my daughter. Please save her. -Mother…- Come here. Daughter… My dear one… Lekshmi sister… Come. You stay here. I’ll see and come. Tell me. Hey, DSP Ameer is coming there. Ok, I’ll take care, leave it. Ameer, how is the investigation going on? Did you get any proof? Yes, we have got a small proof. Please come. Ameer this is Shadhika’s mother. She is Dr.Renuka. Sit down madam. Please sit down madam. Why are you standing mother? sit down. I have a few questions to ask you, As a part of investigation… You can ask us sir. When was the last call from Shadhika? Did she say about any problem? Her last call was at 8.30 in the morning She did not mention about any problem. And then I tried calling her several times. But the call didn’t connect. Was it after coming to Chennai or while travelling? I felt she was travelling at that time too. But, I felt it was the sound of an auto. Auto…? Hello, yes Saravanan, tell me. Serina… Urgently, I have one important meeting. I have to go. Oh… Ok. I will call you. Don’t feel bad when I ask you something. Did Shadhika have an affair with a boy? And how did you not know that she was pregnant? You stay calm. Nothing will happen. Our department is there. Shadhika will come back to your life soon. No other girl should suffer like Shadhika. I will not let it happen. Mother… Mother, relax. Mother… Lekshmi sister… Mother… Police…? Let him come. Sir… Hey, have you seen this girl before? I remember seeing this girl sir. When she came, a boy came here on a bike. She asked for an address, And went away in an auto… Can you recognize the boy if you see him again? That boy has come here several times sir. Anything else…? Do you know anything else about him? On the front of his bike… What is it? There is a sticker of a ghost, sir. Hey, just zoom in that picture. Is it this bike? Ok. Sir, just see this. This is the bike. Yes correct, just zoom in. Same… Sir, I’m Saravanan speaking. We checked all the video footage. The sticker that man said about is there on that bike. Sir, I didn’t get any details.

Anything of this sort could happen. You don’t have any problem. We are the ones in trouble. You just stay happy. Hey… Let the problem come. Let the police catch us. We will see it, when it happens. I’m like this, always happy. Understand? Why are you making me scared too? If you are a coward, the why did you do this job? Hey… Look here. If you stay with me, whatever happens I will be with you. Else if you betray me, I will kill you. Remember that. Who does he think he is? You go brother. Hey Sam… Brother… I’m telling you again, one seat is free. If you want then come.

Ok, where did you get the dead bodies from? Sir, Bobby’s dead body was found on Seithapett railway track. After half an hour, On that very same spot, Sam’s dead body was found.

Hey, don’t lie. I’m also at that place now. Hey, what are you saying? I’m also going away with Bobby, brother. Hey fool… Shouldn’t we get the remittance of our sins? A girl’s curse will not spare us.

HIV infected girl from Kerala, Brutally raped by 3 people… Brutally raped by 3 people… Police investigates for culprits. Hey, what happened there brother? -Auto got upturned. Come hold, hold, hold, and hold the auto. Someone inform the police. All three being suspected for Shadhika case… Auto driver, Renjan, was imprisoned for 3 years for rape. Sir, just see this.

Don’t know sir. Do you know or not? Don’t know sir. Open this one. Do you know him? Yes sir, I know him. Yesterday you showed a girl’s photo right? The day that girl came, This boy came in a bike.

The Rahul you said about… Is not someone you think he is… One test report hasn’t come yet. We will get it tomorrow. In this entire case, there is something suspicious. What do you mean? I checked her medical reports yesterday. She is HIV positive. My God… Presently, the media should not know about this. It must be personal. I tried my best, But I couldn’t save her. Hi, Is he ok? Yes doctor. Yes doctor. Ok. Morning… Hi ma’am. Hi. Good morning ma’am. Morning… How is he now? He’s better doctor. Ok. Take care. Hi Serina… Hi Ameer… I don’t know how to thank you. But anyways, thank you very much. What’s the need for a formality between us? I did my duty. But all the procedures ended early just because of you. I pray that no girl should suffer like this again. What else can we do? Even if we imprison the culprit, they come out easily with the help of money. 7 years old small child, What does it know? Raped and killed… Without any humanity… They used the narrow laws to escape and roam around happily. Many girls in Pollachi, have been beaten up, blackmailed and vulgar videos taped. Even the politicians support this…. We should just kill them when at sight. Even we shouldn’t pity them and kill them off at the streets. A crime of this sort should never happen. The girl Shadhika, might be a reason for change in laws. Not only me, but all the women of this society will fight together. What you are saying is right Serina. Even small mistakes should be given big punishments. Only then, they will fear of committing mistakes. This should be a lesson for those who does the crime. This is not a relief word for Shadhika’s mother. This is an honor given to Shadhika. Sir… So, Shadhika’s case? FIR closed. So, what about those boys? Why did they suicide sir? They understood, they don’t deserve to live in this society.
