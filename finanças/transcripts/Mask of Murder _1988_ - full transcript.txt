(dark mysterious music) (bell tolling) (victim muttering) (dark foreboding music) (victim whimpering) (wind howling) (dark intriguing music) I'm coming. You're looking terrific, Mrs. McLane. Bob, quit fussing with the cake. You're gonna ruin it. Would somebody get the door? Ray, grab the door. [Ray] Yeah, I've got it. Evening, Super. Hello Ray. We knew you were coming so we baked you a cake. Oh. (dark mysterious music) Marianne, sweets for the sweet. Oh thank you, Jonathan. They're lovely. Oh, Vicky. I'd like to meet Jonathan Rich. This is Vicky Moore. She's my best friend. We work together at the mayor's office. How do you do? Pleasure to meet you. [Vicky] Hello. Vicky, this is our chief whose fame goes before 'em. Bob exaggerates a little as usual. (grunts) What marvelous cake. Thanks, John. "Thanks, John." All you did was stab in a few candles. Bob, why didn't you get Jonathan a drink? Uh-huh. How 'bout it, John? Whiskey? Just a small one please. You'd better have a large one if you're goin' to catch up with us. Well I've got a feeling that we should all go easy on this tonight. Hmm? You never know what might turn up. What do you mean, something special? Thanks. I sent a car out to Blackstone Farm this evening. As I said you never know. Blackstone again. What the hell for, John? Yeah, we've had that place staked out until last month. He never turned up. He's got a hole up somewhere. It's winter. As a matter of fact, I received a message just as I was leaving the office which is why I was late here. Some- Help you with anything there? - Rabbits. - No thanks, Bob. [Jonathan] Found human tracks, footprints in the snow leading directly to the old house. Doesn't prove anything, John. No, it doesn't, but it makes me nervous. Nobody's set foot near that place since. Blackstone? Well that's where that awful man did those terrible murders. 'Tis, isn't it? We have our instructions. No violence if possible, you hear? [Policeman] What'd I tell ya? He's in there in the kitchen. [Policeman] Have you been inside? [Policeman] A long time ago and there's nothing in the place but junk. I have to call headquarters. You stay here 'til the police arrive. If he comes out, I'll shoot him. Here's to you all. Oh and have a wonderful time in Bermuda, is it? Yeah, Bermuda. Best place to be at this time of the year. I'm sorry I couldn't let you take Bob along with you, but I need him here. Ray nearly got to go along though. Not to Bermuda. I didn't say that. Well nevermind. Wherever it was, but you been nagging me for weeks and weeks about all that leave that was due to you and there's no fun traveling alone, is it? - Nope. - No. Oh, I'm not. Vicky's coming with me. (phone ringing) I always try to get away at least once a year. Bob. Bob. - Yeah. - Telephone. - Sure. [Jonathan] Bob has been working very hard. [Bob] Yeah, McLane. Jonathan. Oh dear. No peace for the wicked. [Ray] You said it, sir. I didn't. More wine, Vicky? [Vicky] Well I shouldn't really. But well all right, why not? Somebody'll have to drive me home. [Ray] It'll have to be me. Anyway, I'd like to see your new apartment. [Jonathan] Rich. [Ray] What's going on? [Jonathan] They're on their way? [Ray] The great man in action. The whole team? Forget the car, we'll use Cooper's. It'll save time. [Ray] No problem, sir. Well don't do anything until I get there. Right. Is this the one you're after, sir? Krantz? Mm-hmm. I'll get our coats. (dark mysterious music) I'm sorry, my dear. I'm really sorry. On my birthday too. Damn. The one night for it to happen. [Vicky] Want some coffee? [Marianne] Yes, please. I'll go warm 'er up, sir. [Bob] Won't be long, darling. I'll call you if it's late. (doors banging) (car engine roaring) (dark intriguing music) I really want to take a look at this specimen. Why? What does that sort of man look like? Five young women with their throats cut. What makes a man do something like that? That's a job for a shrink, I reckon. Well the psychiatrists have already taken a good look at him and they can't make up their minds whether his problem is in his head or in his balls. I want to try and understand his side of it. Why girls and why always a straight razor? Who uses straight razors nowadays? I got one. Belongs to my grandfather. I mean he uses it to murder young girls. (dark mysterious music) What's the position? He's still in there, sir. How many men have you got? 14 uh, minus one. What do you mean minus one? Rookie, sir. Found a broken window, tried to climb in, cut his arm. Bloody fool, I gave orders to wait. Where is he? Over here, sir. Glass from the window? No, sir. I got through all right, but then he sneaked up on me with a knife. More like a razor to me, John. Where's your gun? Well I think it's still in there, sir. You know my arm, it sorta went limp. And now he's got a gun. That's all we need. This is the man that called us. Right. That was me. I see. Well we're very grateful to you. Now if you'd be good enough to keep outta the way, we'll take over. Get me a (indistinct). Bob, you get back in the car and keep out of sight. We don't want to threaten him any more than he is already. I'll deal with this. 'Kay. Thank you. Johannes Krantz. Johannes Krantz. This is the police. My name is Rich. I want to talk to you. (dark mysterious music) As you see, I'm unarmed! Nobody wants to hurt you. Johannes Krantz, come outside! (dark mysterious music) Come over here, Krantz. Over here. There's nothing to be afraid of. That's right. Over here. Over here. They wanted to hurt me. That's not true. I promise you. (gun blasting) Stop shooting, you fool! (gun blasting) (Jonathan wincing) (gun pattering) Son of a bitch! John! Johnny. Get the medics. Get the medics. - Ambulance! [Medic] Coming! - Sir. - C'mon, Jack. Let's get over there. [Jack] Wait, I gotta get the morphine. [Bob] You bastard. Medics! - Let's go! - Get a move on! Gonna make it. [Ray] C'mon! (shouts) You shit! (gun pattering) (rock smacking) Why the hell did you have to fire through the windshield? I was standing right there. Jesus. - I could see ya, Ray. Your orders were to stay in the car, remember? Hey, c'mon. Come on. Jonathan, how is he? Two bullets in the stomach. Oh, shit. Through the sidebar. Not as bad as it sounds. We've alerted the hospital. He'll be there in time. You got a handkerchief? Yeah, sure. [Bob] Straight to the lab. [Ray] Oh, the famous razor. Yeah, I found it in these coat pockets. I wanna check this house out. Leave me your car, will you? I'll take it to the garage tomorrow. You got a flashlight in here? (dark mysterious music) (siren wailing) Well you might as well finish this off. [Marianne] Well why don't you come over and sit down? I need somebody to talk to, Vicky. I'm worried about Bob and Ray. Aren't you? 'Course I'm worried about Bob and Ray. I'm always worried about Bob and Ray. You don't know what it's like being married to a policeman. Come on. You love Bob, don't you? Of course I love Bob. I mean that's not the problem. There's more to it than that. How do you mean? [Ray] Hi girls. Ray. What happened? Vicky, may I have a glass of whiskey please? Jonathan got two bullets in his stomach. Oh no. He's in the hospital. Where's Bob? He's still at the house. He wants to search the place out. Thank you. (dark mysterious music) (birds chirping) Hi. [Marianne] Hi. Eh, took a little time off. You know, with you leaving and everything. Oh, that's sweet, Bob. But I already ordered a taxi. Uh-huh. Could you do me a favor? Would you try not to be too untidy? I talked to Maria and she's gonna come in three times a week, so she'll take care of your laundry. Okay. Honey, what are you packin' all these warm little clothies for? You can't catch a cold on a beach in Bermuda. It gets chilly at night. Bob, I wish you'd take better care of your clothes. I found that quilted jacket of yours in the garage all covered with these icky stains. Yeah, it got dirty. Look at Jonathan. He's impeccably dressed all the time. Now I took your jacket to the cleaners. Here's the receipt. And I found this yucky thing- Honey, you shouldn't have touched that. Look, it's something I found. I gotta hand it into the lab. (taxi horn honking) Taxi. I'll get the bag. All right and don't forget that one. Mare? Mare. Why don't you stay? We'll send the cab away. Bob, I know you're trying. But why do you keep setting yourself up for a disappointment? Why are you so anxious to fail again? (soft solemn music) (dark mysterious music) (plane engine roaring) [Announcer] Air Canada announces the departure of flight 501 to New York and Bermuda. Would passengers please proceed through gate 12? (passengers chattering) (smooth romantic music) - Hi. - Bermuda delivery service. [Marianne] C'mon in. I'll get the door. Thank you. Here. Thank you. I have some goodies here. How 'bout this: champagne, red wine, whiskey? Only the best. Steak and Camembert, lobster. The whole works. Welcome to Bermuda. Aww. Oh yeah. Did you write those postcards? Sure did. I even have some left over. Who's a clever girl? Did Vicky take them with her? Mm-hmm. She's a real good friend lending us this apartment. She sure is. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. - What for? The curtains are open. I mean- Have you forgotten? This is Bermuda. Remember? And in Bermuda, the neighbors aren't nosy. The only thing there is a railroad track. You don't really believe that clever husband of yours is taking a stroll down it now, do you? Mm-mmm. (chuckles) (smooth romantic music) (singers vocalizing) (train rumbling) (train rumbling) (soft solemn music) (fridge door banging) ♪ We go by ♪ ♪ Juicy, ripe and ready ♪ ♪ Fall into my hand ♪ ♪ She is playin' gently swayin' through the sand ♪ ♪ Juicy ♪ And why you have to meet him in the park? If he's got a car, why can't he pick you up outside? Because in the park, there's moonlight. Oh, come on. ♪ Just what a sight ♪ ♪ Juicy Lucy ♪ Have it your way, dummy. Okay. But watch out, Ellen. He might not be divorced as he says. Oh. ♪ Go by ♪ ♪ Juicy Lucy ♪ ♪ Walkin' to the sea ♪ (dark mysterious music) (Ellen screaming) Hey, what's goin' on? Shut up. I heard a scream. A girl. (rotary phone whirring) Get me Oberman. Yes, it's me. Who the hell else would it be? Get me Oberman. Oh Jack, what the hell's goin' on down there? We've got the whole force out. Seems like Krantz has risen from the dead. I'll be there in 20 minutes. No, gimme half an hour. I wanna drive through that park. Now listen, Jack. I want every single report on my desk. Every scrap of data. Excuse me. Are you a policeman? Yes, ma'am. [Mother] Did your men have to rope off the whole playground? Where do you expect the children to play? Would you really like them to play here now? I suppose not. God knows. You're going to catch that creature, aren't you? We'll get him. It's horrible. Yes, ma'am. Yes. It's horrible. I've been worried about you. Bob, where the hell have you been? Where the hell have you been? Home, mostly. Listen, these two kids in the Oldsmobile. They said they only heard one scream? If she screamed more than once, they said they would've gone looking. I believe them. He must be damn fast with that knife. Razor, Bob. It's a razor. That's what's so weird about the whole thing. It's like watching the same film over again. Krantz is dead, Ray. You should know. You wanna know what I think? I think she only screamed once because she knew the killer. Yeah, that's a possibility. She'd been at a disco with her girlfriend. Place called Copa cabana. What kinda place is that? Run-of-the-mill disco. You been there? Yeah, once in a while. You know the scene, usual combination of meat rack and barnyard. A waitress remembers two girls drinking rum and Coke who fell out with each other. One of them was Ellen. And the other one? Her name's Nita Osborne. She's 22. She's unmarried and they worked together at the Cuddle Inn. Cuddle Inn? What's that? [Jack] It's a mill, textiles or something. Been around a long time. Here's the number. But we've already spoken to her, Bob. She doesn't know a thing. [Bob] I don't give a damn about that. We're bringin' her in. Get Folden for me, will you? [Jack] Okay, anything you say. Charlie, can you tell Folden the Chief wants him? Hello, this is the police. Do you have an employee there called Nita Osborne? Yes, Nita. Nita Osborne. What time she get through work? Thank you. May I speak to her? Oberman, she may not know anything, but she's the only witness we've got. Hello? Nita? This is Superintendent McLane. We'd like to ask you a few more questions in more detail this time. Okay, now your supervisor said you'd be through work at 4:30? Come on! You'll have a police car waiting for you downstairs. Now. Shower? Okay, you take your shower and we'll have the car down there at quarter to five. How's that? Fine. Okay. (citizen shouting) She was scared stiff, afraid the murderer was calling her. She might know somethin', this one little thing. (citizen shouting) Anyway, she said she had to take a shower. The machines made her all sweaty. Bob, she doesn't know a damn thing. I promise you. She was busy fixing a lay for the night, went home with some man from the disco. [Citizen] Fool! Coward! Marianne having a good time? Fabulous weather and clear blue water. [Citizen] I am talking to you! I'm talking to you! Did you hand in the gun and the razor to the lab? Yes, I did. Give this to him too, will you? [Citizen] Open the door. I'ma do it! [Ray] What is it? It's just some crap I picked up at the farmhouse. Will you shut that son of a bitch up? (citizen shouting) Keep him quiet! [Nita] Well I was talking to a couple of guys. I didn't take too much notice of who Ellen was with. She seemed to be having a good time. Oh, you know how it is. Hmm? [Nita] She didn't go to discos much anyway. What about you? I thought I'd just take her along for once. She really needed to well meet somebody. I'm afraid she did meet somebody, didn't she? What did he look like, Nita? I told you I don't know. I never even saw him except in passing when they were dancing from behind. From behind, he looked more or less like you. Hmm. Dance a little. Don't be smart, Nita. Okay, he was 5'11 " or so. What about his coloring? Are you asking me? Yes, I'm asking you. Was he blond or dark? Oh gosh. Sort of medium you know, like most men. Like you, for instance, or you. I just don't know. Nita, didn't Ellen say anything to you except the fact that she was gonna meet the guy in the park? Not really. She was in a hurry to get away. Oh, wait a minute. She said that he was divorced. Yeah, I remember she said that. Divorced. Yeah, sure. (chuckles) She fell for that old line. Divorced? Why don't you believe that? Why else would he tell her to meet him in the park? If he had a car, they could've left from the disco. Yeah, that's what I mean. We know why she met him in the park. I warned her about it. Honestly, I did. May I smoke? I think we can wrap this up. You want a lift home? I can arrange a car for you. What time is it? 10 to 7:00. I think I'll go to the movies, I mean as long as I'm in town. Anybody know what's on? (paper rustling) I think I'll go to the Eldon. They're showing "Eyes in the Dark". Give me a call if anything turns up. Goodnight. Ice-cold little bitch. (soft mysterious music) (crickets chirping) (car engine roaring) (patient whimpering) Oh, come on. Gimme a break, will you? C'mon. Look, I'm tryin' to watch the film. Oh, come on. God. Will you shut up? Shut up yourself. - Look. - It's so worth it. C'mon, wait. No. - Son of a bitch! Come back here! [Girlfriend] I need to get home. Push off. Come back here! Wait 'til I get my hands on you! I'm going. (winces) [Chaser] You bastard! (soft soothing music) So that's all you heard and saw. That's it, yeah. - Yeah. - Thank you. What the hell are you on about? You talk too much, you know that? What? Women. [Officer] Yeah, I need reference 226418. Got that? Now listen, you claim you saw this guy, right? Yeah, damn near knocked me down. [Officer] Caucasian male. Okay. Can you describe him? Did you see his face? Well he just came outta the gent's toilets, you know? He was headin' towards the emergency exit, so I didn't really get a good look at all. Just describe what you saw. Well not a lot. I just guess it was a guy rushing home to catch his old girl on the job with somebody else. Why do you say that? - Well just occurred- - You ever been caught? - What? - On the job with somebody else's wife. What are you, a cop or a friggin' reporter for two confessions? That's enough. - All right, all right. - Yeah, take care now. Did you notice how he was dressed? [Witness] Yeah, I saw the top of his head. [Ray] What about it? [Witness] He didn't have a hat on. You know, he was shaved all over his head. He was white just like a billiard ball. As a billiard ball? You are Ms. Ida Swanson and you were in the ticket office at the Eldon last night. Is that right? Yes, it is. But I'm leaving that job. You see, I don't dare sit there all by myself now. You can't imagine what I saw. That girl, that poor girl. I know. I know, Ms. Swanson. Take it easy now please. Let's see if you can help us. Was there anyone who bought a ticket while the film was being shown? [Ida] You mean after it had started? Yes. [Ida] No, not at all. Oh, I see. Thank you. Mrs. Swanson? Yes. You alright? Thank you. Good. Were you in the ticket office the whole time? No. I usually go for a coffee. When the film is half the way through, just in the room next to the booth. But I can see the doors and nobody went in. Uh-huh. Did you happen to notice anyone in the audience who looked peculiar? Peculiar in what way? Maybe with his head shaved. [Ida] No, I didn't see anybody like that. But I don't see much of the customers except their hands when they buy tickets. Do you remember anyone wearing gloves? [Ida] Yes, lots of them were wearing gloves especially the women. Especially the women. That's it. We can forget about it being a woman. There's nothing to support that. Besides, there's a man in the emergency exits and the whole pattern of these killings. Oh, what have we got to go on? Man in a dark overcoat. He may or may not have had gloves on when he bought tickets at the theater. Yesterday, he was about my height and sandy hair. Today's Yul Brynner. Ah, shit. Have you seen Crossland, Bob? What? I said have you seen Crossland? What for? He's a psychiatrist. He's a doctor and you need to see him. You look bloody awful. When was the last time you had a good night's sleep? Who cares? Oddly enough, I do. You did save my life. I should've sent you to Bermuda with Marianne. That would've been the best thing. Have you heard from her, by the way? Yeah, sure. I got a postcard. So did I and two from Vicky. Oh. Hi Jonathan. A late birthday present. Oh, you brought my things. Thank you very much. It's all here. Just put 'em in the cabinet over there, would you please? And just what's going on in here? [Jonathan] Well well well. Talk of the devil. How's it goin', Paul. Hi. [Jonathan] (sighs) Where have you been? At a conference in Geneva. I'll bet that cost the taxpayers something. Not much more than it cost 'em to keep you in here. How are things going? They're not. Take a look at that. Well according to that and according to one of your own colleagues, the murderer is a reincarnation of Johannes Krantz. I've read the papers, Jonathan. Did you ever read such rubbish? Johannes Krantz is dead and buried and may he rest in peace. It's just press sensationalism. It's idiotic and it's irresponsible. I don't know how they print things like that. Now look, you're the expert. You tell me is it possible for anybody totally to take over the personality of a dead man? You've got me wonderin' if I did kill the son of a bitch. (birds chirping) Ray? Yeah? Underside of the barrier through the iron door, anyone with psychopathic tendencies. What? That doctor Paul Crossland, what he said. A psychopath read about Johannes Krantz could be triggered into copying him. I don't follow you. Nobody has read about Johannes Krantz. Nobody but the police. Newspapers don't know about the weapon, the razor. They don't know about this new thing, the mask. Christ, you don't suspect us. You know what we're gonna do? I want alibis from every one of us connected with this case for the nights of those murders. Hey, don't look at me like that. What do you think I'm gonna do? Where the hell was I? I'm alone now. Come on, it's gotta be done. (Carlos shouting) (dark mysterious music) Hey! Hey! Jesus Christ. Help me out, please. Hey! (window shattering) Drop it, punk. (Carlos wincing) [Carlos] Call the police. He tried kill me. I am the police. Just sit still. Still, still! He a murderer! He tried to kill me! Oh my god. (sobs) (dark mysterious music) (rotary phone whirring) (Carlos whimpering) What the hell are you doin'? Please. Don't. - I told you to sit still. Don't, don't. Don't, don't. (weeps) We'll get a doctor. Now just sit still. I told you before I am the police. Just sit still. The more you move, you'll bleed to death. (rotary phone whirring) (Carlos whimpering) Easy. Hello, this is Bob. Listen, I want an ambulance and two squad cars at North Church Street. Yeah, little barber shop on the right hand side. No. Better still, get me Cooper, will you? - No, no. - Will you shut up? Cooper's not there again? Okay, get me Oberman. (Carlos whimpering) Shh! Hello Jack, I want an ambulance and two squad cars at North Church Street. It's a little barber shop. You can't miss it. Yeah, there's a guy cut up pretty bad. Yeah, I'll wait for you. (Carlos groaning) You cut men and women's hair? Call a doctor. I bleed. I told you there's a doctor coming. Now you'll be all right. Pain. Yeah, I know there's pain. What's this place out front for? Dope? Dope? - Dope. - No, no, no. Murderer come to me. - Murderer. - Yes. You don't go around slashing little girls' throats with a razor, do you? Oh, come on. God, what do I say? Girls? No. What about your friend, the one who cut you up? Does he slash little girls? No friend. Murderer. "No friend. Murderer." Yes. Here. (Carlos whimpering) Shut up and be still. (siren wailing) Ray, I just don't see what that has to do with us. Marianne, you don't understand what I'm saying. No, I don't understand what you're saying. It's the alibis. They're gonna check every single cop on the force to find out where each man was when the murders were committed and it was your husband's idea. Jonathan is gonna go through with it. I know that. (soft romantic music) (singers vocalizing) [Marianne] What are you trying to tell me? Just this: I can't possibly explain where I was on those nights. They know I wasn't at home and I can't prove that I was anywhere else. But maybe you'd like me to tell them the truth. Oh no. You can't. I'm in Bermuda. Bermuda. It's goodbye Bermuda for me. There've been two murders and there could be more and I'm sure as hell gonna be home when they happen. Are you trying to tell me that we're not gonna see each other anymore? This is our last night on the seashore. Just listen to those waves. Ray? Bob knows. It was his idea. I know he knows. No. Yes, he does! I know he does! (soft romantic music) (singers vocalizing) (funky rhythmic music) [Guest] Hello young lady. Hey. I wanna go to bed with you. Ya hear me? I want to screw you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But not here. And it'll cost you, darlin'. [Guest] I've got the money. When do you get off? At 3:00. We can go to my place. [Guest] I'll be waiting for you outside. Okay. (funky rhythmic music) [Guest] Over here, honey. You walk ahead. I'll follow. (funky rhythmic music) [Sonja] Well coming in? [Guest] Just a minute. It's the little door on your right. (dark mysterious music) Well do you want a drink? (dark mysterious music) (wine trickling) (truck banging) Jesus. Come on, you bastard. (Sonja wincing) (clock ticking) Mommy? Hi fellas. [Jack] How 'bout some coffee, Ray? No, thanks. Next time. I'm in a hurry. Where you goin'? I gotta go bowling tonight. I'm late already. I'm afraid of snowmen. Why are you afraid of them? 'Cause one came to our house last night and frightened me. Alex, snowmen can't come indoors. They'd melt if they did. It's too warm for them. [Alex] It was a snowman, a snowman from the circus. Oh, I see. Have you been to the circus? [Alex] Only once with Mommy. And is that where you saw the snowman? [Alex] No. But you said you saw him at the circus. I know, but you know those funny men that keep falling down all the time? Acrobats, clowns? Was he a clown? I don't know, but he didn't have any nose and then he took his head off. He took his head off? [Alex] Yeah. He must've lost it too like his nose. Just like at the circus? No. At the circus, they didn't take off their heads. (door knocking) [Psychologist] Come in. Excuse me for interrupting, but there's a telephone call for you. Oh, that's all right. We won't get any further today anyway. Alex wants to go outside and play with the other children. Don't you? Bye-bye Alex. Maybe we'll see each other again. Bye. No, it was pointless. He's a nice child with a good imagination, but he just can't differentiate his impressions. Mm-hmm. Now I did learn this. He went to the circus with his mother a short time ago and now he's got clowns and snowmen and god knows what else all mixed up together. And now he's here in a strange environment. He's retreating into what feels safest for him, games and make believe, the circus. Yes, I'll record my observations on the same tape, I think. That's the easiest thing. Mm-hmm, I'll bring 'em up to- To Bob McLane, Inspector McLane. Fine. Goodbye. Alex, snowmen can't come indoors. They'd melt if they did. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. [Alex] It was a snowman. This woman's supposed to be a child psychologist. A witchdoctor coulda got more outta the kid than that. [Paul] How's the investigation going? I wanted Krantz alive, Paul. I wanted to be able to dig around in his mind to find out what made him tick. But this character put too many holes in him for that. This is not your common or garden-variety murderer, Paul. The Blackstone murderer is dead and has risen from the dead, at least that's what the newspapers say. Tell me just how does a man like that function. Compare him to yourself. [Announcer] Dr. Marcel, please come to the intensive care. I don't think there's a person alive who hasn't fantasized about committing murder. I can think of a few newspaper reporters that you wouldn't mind strangling. But we, the so-called normal people, we oppress such fantasies. Somewhere in our makeup, there's a barrier which slams shut like an iron door if we're even tempted to turn the fantasy into reality. The psychopath has no such barrier. For him, it's just an open door. It can take sexual outlets, for example. [Jonathan] Yes, but none of these women were raped or anything like that. Maybe he can't do it. Maybe he finds sexual contact repulsive or maybe he doesn't even need to pull down their pants to get his satisfaction. The point is he has no barriers anymore. Whatever is on the other side of his iron door- Listen, we've got- Just a moment. Just a moment please. The other side. Go on. On the other side is total collapse. It could be something he's felt from childhood or a woman who's laughed at his prick. Maybe she said he was a lousy lover, useless between the sheets or maybe she has a lover and blames her deception on his inadequacy. I knew there was a reason I stayed single. Now hold on a minute, sir. Sorry, Doc. I don't understand a word you've both been speaking about, but we've got him. Got whom? The murderer. He's under arrest. We got his fingerprints on file, the ones on the razor that he dropped in the girl's flat. His name is Martin Engels. He's 34 and he's all already a client of ours. He's a bagman for the mafia and a traveling salesman in dope. He specializes in small-time pushes that don't pay fast enough. So as far as I'm concerned, it's all wrapped up. Like hell it is. We are looking for a murderer, Ray, not a small-time crook. It would never occur to Engels to cut a girl's throat if only for the reason that he never does anything for nothing and he doesn't put on costumes either. Put on costumes? Listen to this. [Ray] Did you notice how he was dressed? [Witness] Yeah, I saw the top of his head. [Ray] What about it? [Witness] He didn't have a hat on. You know, he was shaved all over his head. He was white just like a billiard ball. [Jonathan] Now let's try this one, (tape player whirring) This genius of a child psychologist as she interviews our only witness. [Psychologist] But you said you saw him at the circus. [Alex] I know, but you know those funny men that keep falling down all the time? [Psychologist] Acrobats, clowns? Was he a clown? [Alex] I don't know, but he didn't have any nose and then he took his head off. [Psychologist] He took his head off? Well? [Ray] Well what? You heard what he said. Head like a billiard ball, no nose and he took off his head. [Paul] A mask. [Jonathan] A mask. Ray, remember the brown paper bag with the tape wrapped around it? Did you hand that into the lab? Of course I did. [Bob] You sure. Bob. (birds chirping) (hand slapping) (chuckles) Hey! (patrons chattering) You recognize that? Maybe, maybe not. Well I'm askin' ya is this your razor? It looks like you know better than me. Oh, what the hell? Okay. I used it to mark a guy. Maybe I overdid it. But he jumped me first. It was self-defense. Yeah, sure. It's mine. That's what we figured. Now listen, there's a little joint across town called the Green Door. You ever been there? Once in a while. But don't tell my mother. Why, they customers of yours? What do you mean customers? It's a sex joint. Well we'll get to narcotics later. Now this Green Door's just a stone's throw from Carlos' Barber Shop. That's where you cut the barber. Well the police picked up Carlos, but they combed the streets, Engel, and there was no sign of you. (huffs) You expect me to stick around and wait for you? No, but it's logical, isn't it? I mean the Green Door's the perfect place for you to duck in and hide. Maybe, maybe not. But I wasn't there. What're you talkin' about, Engels? That places full of little nooks and crannies. It's even got private rooms where you can lock the doors. Now you went there. And to top off the evening, ya picked up one of the little girls and took her home to get laid. Didn't ya? Look, I don't know what you're talking about. What's the matter, Engels? You got amnesia or somethin'? We found your little girl dead, murdered with this razor. All right, you bastard! Where's the mask? What goddamn mask? What the hell are you tryin' to put on me anyway, you cop bastard? (shouts) Goddamn! Well that was pretty dumb. Oberman, get this punk a doctor. To hell with that. We'll get him. - Ah, sit down! - To hell with that. We gotta get to the bottom of this shit. What goddamn mask? What goddamn girl? Just get this straight, cop. I cut that big barber, okay? But I didn't kill anybody. Then how come your fingerprints are on the razor, the one that cut her throat? Inspector Cooper found it on the floor of her flat. Now come on, Engels. Isn't the fog beginning to clear? Holy Jesus. It was you. You're the one who came into the shop. Nobody called the police. I called the police. I just happened to be there, right? And you just happened to find that razor. What? That's right. I found the razor, then I called the police. Then I picked up a hooker, then I took her home and then I cut her throat. Now that sounds reasonable, doesn't it? Get him outta here! Oberman. Out. Nothin' yet on that mask, huh? You searched the flat. Every square inch. The kid's room too. What about the basement? What about it? Well the garbage chute empties into the basement, right? I don't get you, Bob. Ray, the kid told us that the murderer took off the mask and then left the flat. [Ray] Yes. Well the garbage chute is right next to the front door. But the garbage must've been emptied by now. No, I had the garbage been sealed on my orders. Oh. I'm on my way. Good morning, sir. - Morning. - Morning, chief. Would you tell Superintendent McLane that I would like to see him please? He's out, sir. He's out? Where's he gone? He's on assignment with Inspector Cooper and won't be back today. I see. Thank you. Morning, sir. (dark mysterious music) (sighs) Bob. Jonathan. Marianne. I escaped from the hospital. What are you doing here? Well when I started reading in the headlines about everything that was going on, (sighs) I started to feel guilty about being on holiday while you all were going through all this. So I thought if I came back, maybe I could be of some sorta help. And I thought Bob- So you got our newspapers down there. Mm-hmm. What's that, present for me? No, I bought it for that little boy. I got to thinking about poor little thing waking up in the middle of the night and seeing his mother murdered like that. I mean maybe I could do something. Jonathan, he didn't like the doll. He kept talking about a clown. He asked me if I could take his head off. Alex was talking about a mask. A clown without a nose taking his mask off. Oh, like the one Bob found. The one Bob found. Yeah, the one he brought in for analysis or something. I was going through his clothes to have 'em cleaned before I went on holiday and found that disgusting thing in his pocket. He got mad at me for touching it, you know? He said the lab had to do those tests. I don't know, whatever you guys do to 'em. Get me the laboratory please. (phone ringing) Hello, is that the laboratory? Lang, this is Rich here. Can you tell me if Superintendent McLane sent anything in for analysis during the last two weeks? Yes, sir. But Inspector Cooper brought them in. A handgun and a straight razor. And Inspector Cooper brought them in. Anything else? Yes, a taped up brown envelope. But there's nothing in it. Nothing in it. Thank you. Put me through to the St. Mary's Children's Home please and get me a car. (phone ringing) Hello? Is that the St Mary's Children's Home? This is Chief Superintendent Rich of the police. You have a boy there called Alex Lawson. I'd like to see him please. Yes, he was brought in from South Church Street. Beg your pardon? Oh, he's out playing. I see. Well could you see that he's brought in and get him ready? And I'll send a police car around in 10 minutes. I need to see him. Yes. Yes, I'll wait. Thank you. That boy's the only witness we have. The laboratory knows absolutely nothing whatever about the mask. Hello? Yes. He's what? No, it was not authorized and certainly not by me. No. I'll call you back later. Four cars to South Church Street immediately. Bob picked up the boy 10 minutes ago. What for? I don't know. Maybe he and Cooper had some ridiculous idea about reconstructing the crime or something, but I certainly never authorized it. Where are you going? I'm gonna see what they're up to. Well then I'm coming with you. Oh no, that's quite outta the question. Jonathan, we've been friends for a long time. Now if Ray and Bob are in some sort of problem, I'm coming with you. Very well. Very well. (dark intriguing music) Have the cars left for Church Street? - Yes, sir. - Good. (dark intriguing music) Well here we are. Now it's gonna be a little bit messy inside, but don't you worry about that. [Alex] Can I get my car? You can get anything you want. C'mon. Ray? Do you look under the garbage chute? Yes. My god. Is that what you found? Uh-huh. That's fantastic. We did it. Well what now? Listen, I want you to do something for me. I want you to stand by the bed. And when I give you the word, I want you to put the mask on. No, no, no. Bear with me. I want you to put the mask on and turn around slowly and walk towards the door. Now, now. Trust me. [Alex] Get my gun. Bang, bang. Wow, you got the drop on both of us. Is that loaded? [Alex] I don't know. Well we'll check it out later, huh? We'll check all your toys out. But right now, I want you to play a game with Ray and me. Now you're my buddy, right? - Yeah. - Okay. I want you to show us exactly what you did the night you saw the snowman. (dark mysterious music) Okay? Now, you said that you woke up and you're thirsty. And mommy was sleeping, so you walked to the door. Okay, Ray. - But Bob, it's- - No, no, no. Just do it. - It's stupid. - C'mon. (dark mysterious music) All right. Now it's your turn. You woke up and you're thirsty. And mommy was sleeping, so you walked to the door. It's him! It's him, the snowman. Hold it right there. [Ray] Good god, what the matter with you? I said don't move! Just stand still and keep your hands by your sides. Leave the mask on. (dark foreboding music) The kid just identified ya. You're the snowman, Cooper. I said don't move! You move a muscle, I'll blow you away. Take it easy, Bob. You know, I've had my suspicions for a long time. I checked on you. You don't have an alibi for the night those girls were murdered. You don't have one of them. Now where did you spend those nights, Cooper? - What're you- - Don't move! Dr. Crossland said it all, didn't he? A psychopath, a man humiliated by women, a lousy lover with a child's prick, useless in bed. All right. All right! You wanna know where I spent those nights? I was with your wife! Your wife! That's impossible. Marianne was in Bermuda. Remember the postcards? (gun blasting) [Alex] It fired. It fired! Sure it fired. He was the snowman. We got him. Is he dead? It was a good game. Huh? We got him. Bang, bang, bang! Bang, bang, bang! It was the snowman. We got him. Bang, bang, bang. (dark rhythmic music) Hey Johnny. He's up there. Where's my car? Oh, we're gonna get your car. We're gonna get all your toys 'cause the snowman's not gonna get 'em, is it? No. You're my buddy. Bye. [Alex] Bye. [Jonathan] Very clever, but they'll get you. (dark rhythmic music)
