Several thousand years in the past... in the ruins of Ur, the capital of Babylonia, which once boasted an eminent civilization, a violent monster began hibernating in the ruins, and someone had prophesied it would awaken in four thousand years. The people, who feared disaster, did nothing to disturb the ruins. But as the years went by, the prophecy was forgotten, and those who quietly targeted buried treasure started to appear. Oh, I found it! Caught another one! Hey, hey! Look, Father! Well, let's say that's the last one and go back. My, going back already? It was beginning to get interesting. Look at that. A storm's headed this way. You two go on ahead home. I'll make a quick patrol of the area before I come myself. Yes, Sir. Damn you, monster! Damn you, monster! Izu Magisterial Palace Saheiji, I wonder what happened to Father? The storm dissipated after all. He's probably patrolling through the depths of the territory. After all, he's a benevolent lord thinking of the people. I hope that's the case. Father! When did he... Come now! Stop it. It's Father. Father! My Lord! Father! Father! What the... My Lord, why are you doing this? Tainted things ought to be removed! Tainted? Are you saying God is tainted? Shut up! My Lord! My Lord... Wait, Father! Out of my way! No, Father. Why are you saying God and Buddha are tainted? You respected and revered them just this morning! What is this all of a sudden? Father! Not a word concerning what I do! Hurry up and clean this out! Burn the household altar and everything else! Got it? My Lord! My Lord! I really wonder what happened? It's as though he's a changed man. Steward... There must be a very good reason such a peaceful lord would behave in this manner all of a sudden. I know. Shinpachiro, look after Lady Ohie. My Lord... What exactly happened? What happened in the storm? You're being a pest, Saheiji But, My Lord! What? Who the hell? Some goon disguised as someone? But, My Lord! It can't be said your peculiar behavior isn't out of the ordinary. It can't be... I don't think it can be the case, but have you gone mad? Shut up! Continue your insolence and you'll be punished! What? I wonder what happened to that servant? Steward, how is our lord? What are all of you doing?! Why have you not burned everything?! Steward! It is a grave crime to disobey the lord's orders! Saheiji! Lady Ohie, the same goes for you. If you say one thing too many, even you will be shown no mercy. What happened? Now, even you are saying things like that! Shut up! Get to it! They are to be burned immediately! Damn it. What nerve using that kind of magic. What is it, you filthy bastard? As you can see, I'm Kappa the water imp! Water imp? I'm not just an ordinary water imp! I'm the master of this house! Master? I don't know what kind of apparition you are, but it's an embarrassment to me to let you do whatever you want in my territory! Now, hurry up and get lost! Wait, damn you! If that's how you want it, I'm prepared for the worst! Don't cry if you get hurt! Ow! Ow! Ouch! Hot! Ow... damn it... Damn you! I'll remember this! Ow... That hurt. Hey! Hey! It's anyone here? Hey! Why? That's weird. O h, it's you. You surprised me. Where's everyone else? Over here... I'm over here... What's with the ghastly look? Eh? I need a big favor. I need every one's help. To do what? I got kicked out of the place I live. Kicked out? By who? Some awesome monster. Monster? What kind? he's got a face like an ogre and the body of a beast. If he bites a human, the human's personality changes completely. Changes personality? At any rate, it's a monster I've never seen nor heard until today. You'll all help me, right? No way. Why not? What? If it was something else, it's about you so... If you really got kicked out, we'd help you no matter what, but... Hey! You think I'm lying to you guys?! Apparition Social Register Apparition Social Register Apparition Social Register? Apparition Social Register? Japanese Apparition Picture Book Japanese Apparition Picture Book Japanese Apparition Picture Book? Japanese Apparition Picture Book? What are these? Take a good look. Those have all the apparitions in Japan in them. The monster you described isn't in them at all. But... Didn't you see some hallucination because you're lacking water? No, if you think I'm lying, you can see it for yourself. It's real. You have to believe me! Come on! Cool off his head. Shinobu, worrying about it here won't solve anything. Go to bed. But... It's alright. My Lady! My Lady! Lady Ohie! Lady Ohie! What's the matter? What are you doing here by yourself? I've been lurking to see if I can find some clue as to why his lordship and the steward have become changed men all of a sudden. I see. What about yourself? I was concerned and couldn't sleep. I was speaking to Shinobu the maid and a sudden urge to sleep overcame me. When I woke up, she was gone. When you became sleepy, Shinobu disappeared? I had a bad feeling about it, so I've come to look for her. I'll investigate. Please go back to your room and wait there. Alright. Let's go. My Lord... Shinpachiro? Yes! Come in. What do you want at this hour? Has Shinobu come this way? No! But, My Lord... It's that all? What nonsense. Get lost! Yes, My Lord. Shinpachiro! What's the matter? Shinobu is... I went back to the room and she... What?! Shinobu! Onki riki basaranbatten, onki riki basaranbatten... Onki riki basaranbatten, onki riki basaranbatten... Onki riki basaranbatten, onki riki basaranbatten... Onki riki basaranbatten... Onki riki basaranbatten, onki riki basaranbatten... Onki riki basaranbatten, onki riki basaranbatten... Onkiri kibasaranbatten, onkiri kibasaranbatten... Shinpachiro... There isn't even the slightest doubt. They're all tricks only a demon can perform. Then I can assume that the demon is the Magistrate himself. So that's it. A demon's life is extended by drinking the living blood of humans. The maid Shinobu was unfortunately turned into a sacrifice. A demon's sacrifice... Uncle, is there some way to remove that demon from the Magistrate? No! The demon did not take over the Magistrate's body. The demon is merely disguised as the Magistrate. Then, what of the Magistrate? He is no longer of this world. If that's the case... What needs to be done to kill the demon? Just ask the Buddhist monk. Tonight, between seven and nine, stand these three candles around the room the demon is in. Around the room? If you get close, I'll notice your presence, but as long as you have this protective charm on you, you'll be able to counteract the demon's powers. Just in case that fails... Use these. If you can blind it, then the rest will be up to the Buddhist monk. I'll see to that even if it means it kills me! Uncle! Go! Hurry! Yes, Sir! Onkiri kibasaranbatten, onkiri kibasaranbatten... Onkiri kibasaranbatten, onkiri kibasaranbatten... Onkiri kibasaranbatten, onkiri kibasaranbatten... Onkiri kibasaranbatten, onkiri kibasaranbatten... Onkiri kibasaranbatten, onkiri kibasaranbatten... Onkiri kibasaranbatten, onkiri kibasaranbatten... Onkiri kibasaranbatten... Foul demons all be eradicated by Buddha... Saheiji, having only adults leads to monotony. I'd like the blood of some growing young ones as well. Be gone, foul enemies! Kanmanbohron! Be gone, foul enemies! Kanmanbohron! Be gone, foul enemies! Kanmanbohron! Be gone, foul enemies! Kanmanbohron! Be gone, foul enemies! Kanmanbohron! Be gone, foul enemies! Kanmanbohron! Be gone, foul enemies! Kanmanbohron... Uncle! Just wait and see. I'll definitely... You're strong, Oiichi. Run! Hurry! Big brother! Quick! Big brother! Out of the way! Damn you! Resisting your social superiors?! Search for the brats! Yes, Sir! Big brother, big brother! Big brother, it's a monster's shrine. It's okay. Don't do anything bad and it'll be alright. But... They wouldn't dare go in there. Why are you withdrawing? This is... What of the apparitions? If they come out, they're to be disposed of. Go! Yes, Sir. Damn it! Not one of them believed me. Ah, this sucks. Hey! It showed up! Ghosts! There are ghosts! What are you talking about? They're human kids. Aren't you the ghost? I see. Get a hold of yourself. The problem is seeing some unfamiliar faces. What are they doing here? Please, please help us. What? Help you? That... We're weak against charms. would you tuck them away? If we're captured by the Magistrate, we might be killed. Why is that? I don't know why, but our neighborhood friends who were taken away to work as servants all came back dead. Dead? Yeah, if we get captured, we'll probably be killed too. Hey, hey, the Magistrate here is a very forgiving man. He's not the kind of evil man who would kill people. I tried to tell you, didn't I? That's not the Magistrate. It's a ghost! It's an apparition who disguised himself as the Magistrate! So, it was true after all. Finally, you understand. But what the heck is he anyway? It's an apparition from Babylonia. What? Babylonia? His name is Daimon. Aobozu and Ungaikyo! How do you know? Take a good look. That's him! He's certainly got an evil face. Will you help me? Of course. If we leave the likes of him alone, shame will be brought upon Japanese apparitions! Right, everyone? Yeah! You kit's relax and wait. Alright... As a little gratuity for coming over here, Let's go pummel those goons. What's wrong? What happened? My leg! My leg! It's a curse! Scary, is it? Do you understand how those kids you went after felt now? Get it now? Now that you do, don't you dare do anything disgusting again. Now get lost! So you don't want to go home?! Let's go! Hey, is there some rather odd wind blowing? Really? Could it be that someone's here? Nope. Really? I got the feeling someone was. Hey... On a night like this... Something scary happens. My dear departed grand ma used to say so. That's a ridiculous superstition. I don't feel a thing. Hey, what happened? Hey, someone... my cheek... It's a ghost. A ghost! Idiot, there's no such thing. No, there are. There really are. What's the matter? Hey, why are you shaking like that? What's the matter with you? There's nothing there. Hey, what were you looking at anyway? A monster, an umbrella monster. It was over there. What the hell is that? Want some? This is exactly what I thought. Give it a rest already. No, no! Just now, I was the one who licked you, but who licked my cheek? If you don't cut it out, I'm going to get pissed off. No, no. This is for real now! Don't touch me! Let go! Open the gate! Open the gate! We brought some kit's to do some menial tasks. We'll open the gate. Hey! Phew, now it's reassuring. Something wrong? Oh, nothing. We'll do an inspection just as a formality. What's the matter? A really cute girl, there's nothing scary about her. That's ridiculous! What are you talking about? Take a good look! What's so cute about her?! What are you talking about? She's cute. Peel your eyes open and take a good look. Okay, everyone. Follow me. Move it! My Lord, I brought her. Come this way. Idiot, you think I'll be defeated by something like this? How about this?! Get a hold of yourself. Hang in there! Alright! Help me! Are you alright? Hey! Karakasa! You okay? Damn it! Damn it... You seem to have taken the worst hit. You okay? Father! Father? Father? Now I know your true identity. Prepare yourself! Shinpachiro! My Lady, this is not the Magistrate. He is an apparition who killed your father and is disguised as him! As evidence, please take a good look! So you've gone mad, Shinpachiro. It's showing. Some samurai is fighting against Daimon. A samurai? Try again, Ungaikyo! Hey! Ungaikyo! It's showing again. Wait, Shinpachiro! Do your best, Ungaikyo! Now's a critical moment. Don't exhale! Damn it, it was just getting good. Can't be helped. Let's go back! Yeah... Let's go! No, you mustn't. Unlike everyone else, you only have one leg, and it's hurt, so don't push yourself. Ouch! Help me! Help me! Ow, ow, ow... Help us! Help us! Help us! You suck, Buddha! It was just getting good and you trapped us here! Man, this is pathetic. What? It's Daimon! Hey, everyone! Daimon's been defeated! What? Father! Father! Shinpachiro... It was as you said. Now everyone should be able to live in peace. I thank you in my father's place. My Lady... Oh, no, those two think Daimon died! We have to tell them he escaped! Yeah, since he still has that servant who acts as his double, he'll probably be back! But there's no way to tell them while we're trapped inside a place like this. That's troubling. What should we do? Hey! I'm a servant by the name of Saheiji Kawano. I am here to welcome Lord Iori Ohdate, the new Magistrate. I'm Iori. I may cause you to stumble due to my youth, but I'm counting on you. Yes, My Lord. My Lord! My Lord! What happened? It's nothing to make a fuss over. Hurry up and go! Yes, My Lord! My Lord! This... I wonder where every one went? No matter where we search... They finally found us. Are they inside here? Don't touch! Why? And why are you trapped in here? Never mind that! Run to the Magistrate's place! The Magistrate's? You need to tell the samurai called Shinpachiro Mayama that Daimon is still alive! He can't let his guard down! Then have that person come here, and have him remove the tag on the vase. will be solved. Hurry! Will do. Izu Magisterial Palace Lower the palanquin. You're Shinpachiro Mayama, correct? Yes... Take him! What? Get up! What's the meaning of this? It is for the sin of murdering Hyogo Isobe, the previous magistrate. An apparition was behind the magistrate's murder! Shut up! You think I'm easily deceived by such lies? Saheiji, take him away! Move! Please wait! Lord Ohdate, my father's death was definitely caused by an apparition. I saw it with my very own eyes. Even you are talking such nonsense. Lady Ohie, there are no such things as apparitions. Don't tell me such nonsense. Execute him! What? No, you can't! Saheiji, move! Yes, My Lord. My Lord! It was an apparition behind this! My Lord! My Lord! Shut up! My Lord! I said, shut up! Move! My Lord! My Lord! What should we do? With Daimon as the enemy... That's true. This is out of our league. Isn't there some way? We're not evil monsters. If you'll help us save our friends, we'll help rescue Mr. Shinpachiro. Help Shinpachiro? That new magistrate, Iori, is actually a monster called Daimon. It's the monster who killed your father. So that scary thing was still alive. If you understand that, Let's hurry. If we delay, Mr. Shinpachiro will be executed. Let's go. Remove the tag from the vase. The tag? Thank goodness. What a relief. What of Shinpachiro? What? I see. So Daimon used such a dirty trick after all. Hey, every one. We have a debt for being freed from the vase. We can't just back down now. Right, if we don't fight now, people all over Japan will get their blood sucked by Daimon. We let that thing roam free, and our reputation as Japanese apparitions will be tarnished. But how? He's immortal. No, he's got a weak spot as well. Mr. Shinpachiro proved that. The eye, his eye. Eye? The scary part is that staff which gives him all sorts of magic powers. If we were to smash his left eye and cut him off from those powers, I'm sure we would win! I see, alright. Let's first gather our forces from all over the country then. We'll hit him all at once! Right! Right! Let's go! Damn it... Don't put on such a scary face. Drink it. The hell I will! If you don't listen, you won't appear in this world again. What are you talking about? I'm an apparition. Apparitions are immortal. When I get serious, there's no one who's immortal. You bastard! Hold it right there! So you've come, water imp. You don't know when to quit. What are you talking about, That's you! We'll make sure you never do any evil again by showing you the power of Japanese apparitions! Well, come on! Alright, then perish together. Like I'm falling for that again! Take this! That's not all! Hot! Hot, hot, hot! Damn it! Damn it! Kick his ass! Go! Maybe his eye wasn't his weak spot? That can't be! This isn't like you. But... Attacking Daimon's clones won't do any good. What? If we attack the real Daimon's eye, we'll definitely win. But Aobo... How do we attack the real one? They all look alike. What are we to do? Strange... Damn... Him! That's the real one! Hey! That one! Mister, give me a lift! Hey! Daimon's escaping! It's running! We won! We Japanese apparitions won! That bastard, making me go through hell. You're alright? Like I'm going to die! Let's withdraw! Shinpachiro, they won. The Japanese apparitions won. I'm sure they got rid of it. It'll probably never return.
