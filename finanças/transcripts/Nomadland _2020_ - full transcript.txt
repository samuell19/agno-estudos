I've worked all my life, Vern I have been working since the age of 12 I raised two daughters! Inconceivable During my search on the net, I stumbled upon the inexpensive Bob Wells lifestyle I can live in a truck and travel I don't have to work for the rest of my life RTR is a backpacker camp.

You are more wonderful and mild The summer winds shake the May buds violently Most of the summer days are fleeting The summer sun sometimes envelops us in flames of fire His golden forehead turns a gloomy color Every beauty that is overwhelmed by it... beauty disappears and collapses By chance, or by the act of monotonous days But the eternal beauty of your summer will not be overtaken by the yard And what you gifted to the universe will not be lost of the magic of perfection Death flees before you, defeated in shyness And you are always in my poem, you will grow up in majesty As long as a person's breath remains... or an eye sees this existence My hair will stay bright to give you immortality The Poem of Sonnet 18 - William Shakespeare * Fern! .Hi - You did it. - Yes.

I want to say some words Welcome to Fern By her presence at this family feast The elite of new family members, and old ones as well And everyone in between So, welcome, Fern! - Thank you. I liked that name... Empire We had an airport, and public swimming pools Golf yard - Looks beautiful. How was your house there? Nothing special. A house like the rest of the company's homes In fact, he was special It was located at the edge of town And our backyard was enormous It was an extension of the desert Until its meeting with the mountains There was nothing on our way I am so grateful to have you with us Dave really likes you Oh really? - Yeah - He talks about you most of the time !Happy year .Happy New Year She liked rocks See you on the road, Swanky Bo “didn't recognize his parents.” We didn't have children If I didn't stay... if I left It will look like it never existed! I couldn't pack up and simply leave Bo "sincerely love Empire." I like his job so much I loved being there... and everyone loved him So I stayed In the same house and in the same town : Dad used to say "The memory perpetuates its owners." And I've spent most of my life remembering Bob Do you understand what I mean? I can feel you It's very rare that I talk about my son ... but today, it used to be It would have been his 33rd birthday Five years ago, he committed suicide And he still had a hard time talking about this ... and for a long time Every day was like... A question I ask myself How do I live on this! Earth and it no longer exists And I didn't get an answer And I had some tough days ...But I wanted it... ... I can immortalize him By serving people, helping them This gives me reasons to live Sometimes this is all I live on And here you will find many people of our ages You will not believe that they suffered loss and loss And many of them didn't get past it either There is nothing wrong with that No harm ... what I love most in this life That there is no last farewell I have met hundreds of people here And I never said my last farewell All I say: “See you in the future This is what happens Maybe after a month or a year or sometimes years But I see them again I can see the road, with absolute confidence in my heart That I will see my son again And you'll see Powell again Then you can... remember your life together Are you sure you don't need these items? I don't need it. I'm fine I will not miss a single one of them Okay. See you later then "Empire". At an altitude of 4000 meters Dedication to those who have left.
