[SIREN WAILING] Just wait here. I just got the call. Is there anything I can do? I don't know. Talk to her, maybe. But I'm afraid that might just make things worse. I'd like to stay. Fine. Wait back there. You're right. It's a very expensive policy. But Heinrich, you've got to ask yourself. What's it going to cost you if you don't have it? Let's not have an argument, miss. This is not rare. Anyone can see it. It's not rare. You didn't ask for rare, sir. But if you'd like... Is it necessary to turn this into a confrontation? I am making myself clear now, aren't I? I am not trying to argue with you. I said I'd take it back. Then do so. Would anyone else like to change their order? Excuse me. Uh, miss. That was very funny what you said over there. Yeah. I don't think he got it. No. I don't imagine you have any nights off. Thursday. Well, Thursday's good for me. Me, too. Thursday, then. [BOTH LAUGHING] Laurie, Matthew. Lunch. Yeah. Very good, yeah. Oh, I don't know what you like. I like everything. MATTHEW: Don't give me any of that... I know. No potato salad. When we were kids, Mom and I tried forever to get him to eat potato salad. But I made it this far. I'm not going to regress now. What do you want to drink? Um... I don't know. What are you having? I am having soda. Have a beer, if you want.Okay. Soda's fine.WILLY: Soda. Coming up. So, there really isn't a reason. Yeah. I don't know. I guess I just always do that. Well, you know, you could have whatever you want. I know. Haven't you ever, like, you know, you're around people you hardly know and... No, I guess, you haven't. I don't make you feel uncomfortable? No. You sure?Not at all. Good. EDNA: Laurie, I want you to listen to what your father says. We both are only concerned about your happiness. You don't want to ruin this for yourself. I really don't think she's listening. Hey, do you need anything? Everybody having a good time? Oh, yes, yes. Very nice affair. I am happy. Are you happy? I love you. Can I steal my bride for a little while? Oh, sure. Come on. Could we have your attention please? Settle down back there. Laurie and I have something that we would like to say. First of all, I would like to thank you all very much for coming here today and I personally would like to thank my mother and my father, for their love and support. And over the years their tolerance as my sister will attest to. Mom and Dad, I love you, thank you very much. MAN: Cheers. Cheers. [APPLAUDING] And now Laurie has something she'd like to say. It's okay. Just read what we wrote. I love you. I'd like... I'd like to thank you all for coming. [GUESTS MURMURING] [SCATTERED CLAPPING] Cheers. GUESTS: Cheers. Cheers. Let me get my grip. There you go. Watch it. Okay. Where do you want it? Lady, please. [STAMMERING] Is that the... I don't know. LAURIE: Um. Um. I don't know, I don't know. Matthew said, okay, there's two sofas. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Just put it down. Just put it down. Laurie? Laurie? Laurie? [SOBBING] Laurie? What's the matter, sweetheart? What happened?I am sorry, I couldn't, I did...What happened? [SOBBING] I didn't... I just, I couldn't... I just... I just... I did it wrong. I just didn't get it right. I did it wrong. Honey, what happened?I did everything wrong. I did it wrong. It's okay. It's all right. I didn't want to do it wrong. YOUNG LAURIE: One, two, three. Laurie, I just waxed that. [GASPS] You said we didn't have to go. Why do we have to go? Why can't we stay with Aunt Laurie? Because your Aunt Laurie is not here, is she? But you said.I know what I said. But she's not here. Now let's go. I am not missing my doctor's appointment, okay? Come on. She's here. Yeah.Yes. All right. All right. Get your things off. Laurie will help you. Yes. [SIGHS] The kids are inside and I've got to run. I am already late. You were supposed to be here half an hour ago, Laurie. What's the matter? I was... There was an accident.Laurie? Laurie? Linda, what's going on? LINDA: Matt, hi, I'm sorry to call you from work, but... [TALKING INDISTINCTLY] I don't know. That's the thing, she seems fine now. Well, did it swell up at all?I don't know, it looks... She won't let me touch it...Laurie. What are you doing up? I am fine, okay. Let's go home. Sure. Laurie? I just went to the car. There's nothing wrong with the car. Well, you told Linda you were in an accident. I said there was an accident. If I had swerved a little hard I would have hit them. What about your arm? I must have just thrown it out. But it's okay now, thank you. Okay. Laurie, did you make that all up? Yes. Why? Why? [ENGINE STARTING] [VACUUMING] MATTHEW: Laurie. Laurie? Why are you doing that now? Well, I want the place to look nice when your parents get here. Honey, they are not coming over until next weekend. But I just didn't want to forget. [VACUUMING] [HONKING] [HONKING] MATTHEW: Laurie? Honey, we're going to be late. We got dinner reservations for 8:00. Laurie? [PHONE DIALTONE BEEPING] Hey, Laurie. [SCREAMING] No! I swear to God I'll kill you. I will kill you. I will kill you. Laurie.Stay away from me. I am going to kill you. Stay away from me. I mean, sometimes she's great, you know, and then, other times, I don't know. I get... Confused sometimes, like, I don't know what he wants. What I want, Laurie? Well, his mother is very active in the community. You know, community groups, stuff like that. And his sister too. And I don't even have a job. I never said I wanted you to do that kind of stuff. Maybe if I got a job. We often communicate things without expressly saying them. Now, come on, we got a problem here. We got a really big problem. This is not a marriage counseling kind of thing. That is not what this is about. What is it about, Matthew? What's it about? I don't know what to say. Uh... She's... Sometimes I think she's going crazy. I feel that way sometimes, like, I never know what he wants. It's not what I want. She attacked me with a knife. I didn't know it was you. My degree is in Communications, but I did do some graduate work in Marketing. Have you used computers before? Well, in the marketing work, we used them all the time. Not programming, well, not a lot. Mostly data handling. Hmm. All right. All right. All right. Way to go. I am so proud of you. This is going to be so good for you. I know. I think so, too. I mean I'll meet a lot of new people, and I think this is just what I need. Oh, that's great. Let's go out and celebrate, okay? But, Matthew, I told them that I knew all about computers. Why did you do that for? You don't know anything about computers. Now you are going to go in there and... Okay, okay, wait, wait. We are going to figure something out here. When do you start?In two weeks. The woman I'm replacing is pregnant and she leaves in two weeks. Okay, well, I'll tell you what. First thing in the morning, we are going to find you a tutor or a class. You really think I can do this? Of course, you can do this. Well, I'm proud of you. Matthew?Hmm? Can I have a baby? Well, of course, we can have kids. No, no. I mean now. That other lady, she's leaving because she's having a baby, and if I was pregnant, then I wouldn't even have to take this job. Laurie? We usually just go downstairs for lunch. Why don't you join us? Oh, that's sweet, but I brought a sandwich. You know, I figured I'd work through lunch. Try to get a hang of it. Okay, well, tomorrow, then. More on the way. Leave room for more. In an hour you can be in Chicago. Well, you know what. These are kind of rare, is that the way you like them Mrs. Webber? That's fine, dear.Oh. Daddy, can we have a couple of better done? Oh no, these are fine, really. Oh, no, no. Mom, take this one. Sure.Might as well have what you want, right? We pulled out the wall of my house.Here you go, Matty. It was amazing to see that some was cedar...Aren't you gonna call Laurie? And some was... What? Laurie, isn't she eating with us? Laurie? Dinner. Okay, try and get them. Oh, look, look, look. Oh, my gosh.We missed it. Okay, okay, look, look. See the one on the orange flower? GIRL: Oh, look, There's one right here. Where?I got it. I got it. I got it. Okay. Look. I got it. I got it. You got it too?Yeah. Okay. Let me see. Oh, oh, neat. Oh, it's trying to get away. Look, it's saying hello. [LAUGHING] Well, I really got to say that I am glad you two could make it. It's nice to have both families here, I think. Oh, nice of your sister to invite us. Oh, yeah, sure. I was sort of hoping we might have a minute to talk. Laurie has been having some problems lately. Oh, I am sure it will be fine, dear. Yeah. I am too. I just thought maybe you might know something about it. What kind of problems are you talking about? Um... Sexual problems? No, no... Psychological, I guess you'd call it. Oh. I thought maybe when she was little that she might have had... No. No, there was no problem. She was fine. Well, you know, just, she's been a little distant and kind of disoriented lately. Not Laurie, no. Well there is something. He should know. She was very shy when she was in the seventh grade. Was it the seventh or the eighth, dear? I don't remember. Well, she was kind of awkward and her ears stuck out. We took care of it. She had surgery and she's been fine ever since. Oh, no Popeye. It doesn't look safe and you're all out of spinach. POPEYE: Stand aside, Olive. There may be trouble. [LAUGHING] Got you. [KIDS LAUGHING] I don't know what to say, Matthew. I see her with my kids she's like a totally different person. Oh, she's great with kids.[SIGHS] It's everybody else. I mean sometimes I even think that we ought to have kids. But, she barely makes it through the day as it is so... You don't have to stick it out forever, you know. She's seeing a doctor. And? And he She is a pretty woman. She looks at you with those big eyes. You and the doctor, you all just melt, and nothing gets better. Well, I will find another doctor.It's not a contest, Matthew. Who can take the most pain? People do get divorced. Well, I'm not one of them, okay? [SIGHS] She's not the person you thought she was. You don't have to feel responsible. You don't understand. I do feel responsible. She is my wife, Linda. I am responsible. Okay? What's the matter with me, doctor? You just happened to do an odd thing. That's all. It's like I can't touch things. Matthew asked me for the paper the other day and I couldn't hand it to him. I brought it to him and all of a sudden, I couldn't hand it to him. I had to let go. You had to? Am I crazy? I wouldn't say that. Am I going crazy? DOCTOR: You have been under a lot of strain. This should help you relax. MATTHEW: Uh, excuse me. Yes. I just had a meeting around the corner and I was wondering if Laurie might be free for lunch. I'm sorry, I'm Matthew Wade. You're Laurie Wade's husband. Yes. Your wife worked for us two days, Mr. Wade. She hasn't answered any of our letters. We have been trying for weeks to make contact. I'm sorry... What letters? There was considerable damage to one of the terminals. But I don't want to make this difficult, Mr. Wade. I trust we will be indemnified. Mr. Wade? Mr. Wade? Why didn't you tell me you lost your job? They were just too nasty to me. And you stopped seeing the doctor, didn't you? He was only giving me tranquilizers. But you're not taking them. Laurie, don't you understand that there's something the matter. Come here. I missed you. Laurie, we got to talk about this. Now you have got to keep seeing the doctor. And if you don't tell him the truth, then he can't help you. You mad at me? I am not mad at you. But you have got to fight this thing. I will. I promise. I was just about to get up but since you're here... No Laurie. Now tell me what happened at work. I love you, Matthew. What happened? I just I get so scared sometimes and... I mess things up and I think you're not going to love me anymore, and I think about how much I love you. How much I want you. Matthew, I don't want to be the way I am. I don't. I want to be what you want. I want to be the wife...No. This is not going to happen. Now stop it. I can't believe that you were thinking about having sex with all this going on. God. It's the only thing I still know how to do. Matthew, don't leave me. You are the only one that's ever really cared for me. Laurie, I feel stuck. I feel trapped. Now, I don't know what the hell is going on with you. I don't even know who you are anymore. I was just going to fix myself something. Do you want anything? You know, I swore I'd stand by you, but I just can't cope, I can't. Well, Matthew, you have to do what you think is right. You know, maybe we weren't meant for each other, you know, I think, I think maybe if you went home, your parents could take care of you. Why would they do that? [PHONE RINGING] Hello?Mort, this is Matthew. Now I don't know how to say this, but I cannot handle this anymore. I can no longer take care of Laurie. And she, I think, is in a lot of trouble. MORT: I am sure it will all work out. No, it's not going to work out. Things are getting worse. She's been seeing a psychiatrist and I don't think he's helping. Ah, those guys are just quacks. Whatever it was she did it's got you all worked up. It's Matthew. I think he and Laurie had a fight. We did not have a fight. I am telling you she cannot cope anymore. You are a sensible boy, Matthew and every marriage has its failings. MATTHEW: Every marriage does not have this. Now I am walking out of here and somebody's got to take care of Laurie. Have you talked this over with Laurie? Yes, I've talked it over with her. Are you listening to me? I can't... Oh, the hell with this. What the hell is with them? You're sick and I can't believe they just keep hiding from it. Must have been like this your whole life. They just pin your ears back and everything's fine, right? Well, everything is not fine. [PHONE RINGING] Hello?Mort, you son of a bitch, have you got any idea what your daughter is going through? She is falling apart. I am walking out of here, and I want to know what the hell you're going to do about it. Oh, is Laurie there? Yeah, she's right here. Hi Daddy, how are you? I'm fine. LAURIE: How's Mom? She's fine. She's cleaning. Are you all right, Laurie? Is there a problem with Matthew? Not really. Everything's fine. Oh, that's it. Well, I was thinking about having you and Mom over for dinner next week. [DOOR SLAMS] Well, how's Friday or Saturday? [CAR ENGINE STARTING] Well, I can make whatever you want. [TIRES SCREECHING] LAURIE: I know Mom, but this is my home too. EDNA: I just think she shouldn't be alone. MORT: The condo will be clean. Everything will be ready. We will take the early flight. We should be in Miami by 2:00 and get in some golf. Maybe we shouldn't garage the car. Of course, garage the car. Maybe Laurie would want it. Ah, she never liked that car. Besides, she has her own car. EDNA: I suppose. What's the matter, Laurie? This. Well yes, this. And you hardly touched your dinner. I'm moving back in with Matthew. Does your father know about this? When did you work this out? Well, we're not really getting back together. It's just going to be for a few days until you and Daddy go off to Florida. Oh. You don't have to move out just because we're here. You can have all the privacy that you want. I know, but the house will be empty then and I always like an empty house. I missed you. Is it okay? Can I stay for a while? Is it okay? Yeah. I missed you, too. I'll do anything you want. I'll be anything you want. Oh, I am going to make you so proud of me. I love you. I'm going to be late for work. Goodbye.Goodbye. All right, this time I'm really leaving. I love you.I love you, too. [PHONE RINGING] Hello? LINDA: Hello? [PHONE RINGING] Hello? Who is this? You think you are so good, so smart. You're not smart at all. [DIALTONE RINGING] Oh, my God. Hi. Hello, beautiful.Beautiful. Oh, thank you. What's that?Nothing. What is it?No, really. Let me see.It's nothing. I swear. What did you get me? Oh, Matthew. It's adorable. Thank you. You're welcome. This looks terrific. I did the laundry, too. I told you I could handle things. I know. Now go wash up. Dinner's almost ready. [STRAINING] [PANTING] Laurie, Laurie, Laurie, Laurie, Laurie. Seven, seven, seven, seven, seven. Laurie, Laurie, Laurie, Laurie. Seven, seven. [CRYING] Seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven. When are they coming back from Florida? Two weeks. I don't know. Sure you will be okay? You sure you want to do this? I could help you unpack. I mean, I know that's hard for you. I could get your stuff all straightened out. You make sure you see the doctor. Make sure you keep the appointment. You talk to him. You really work hard at this thing. I told you I would. It's probably just a chemical thing in your brain, like a imbalance or something and they can fix it. Did you talk to my doctor? Did he say that? No. I have been reading about it. See if I could find out anything. That's sweet. Really sweet. Okay. Bye. [LOUD TAPPING] [PHONE RINGING] LINDA: Hello? Oh. Oh. LINDA: Hello?[MOANING] LINDA: Who is this? [HANGS UP PHONE] [PHONE RINGING] LINDA: Hello?[LAUGHING] [LAUGHING]LINDA: Laurie, is that you? [TAPPING ON PHONE] [PHONE RINGING] Hello. [LAUGHING] [PANTING] Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Wait a minute. This is your wife or your ex-wife you're talking about? Oh, she's my wife, but we're getting a divorce. Then she's not living here. No, she doesn't live, well, she lives here sometimes. So you didn't actually see her. Oh, come on. Now, who else would do this? I'll check it out. What does that mean? I'll check it out. You say she stabbed you. Let's see what she says. JOHN: Mrs. Wade.Laurie, please. JOHN: I'd like to ask you a few questions if you don't mind. First off, I would like to know where you were last night. Well, here.JOHN: Alone? Uh-huh.JOHN: Nobody saw you? Mmm-mmm. Did you make any phone calls? Mmm-mmm. All right look, here's the problem. Someone stabbed your husband last night. He thinks it was you. Oh, well, you know I hate to say this but I think this is one of Matthew's tricks. See, we're in the middle of a divorce and he is fighting over every single thing, so I am sure he thinks this will make me look bad. I think I got the picture. But someone did stab him, ma'am. If you say it wasn't you... He wasn't hurt, was he?No, it's nothing serious. Oh. You know then he probably did it himself or had his brother-in-law do it. I mean, he wouldn't even let me have the car. How am I going to get around when I don't even have a car? Ma'am, I... I try not to take sides in these things. I'll just let myself out. What can I help you with, Mr. Wade? What did she say?She claims she was home at the time. By herself, right? Hell of an alibi. Well, to tell you the truth Mr. Wade, it is a pretty good one. You didn't see her so you are not much of a witness. Her prints weren't on the ice pick, so it's her word against your guess. Does that look like a guess? She stuck an ice pick in my chest. Now, you may believe every word she says. But I want to see her deny it to my face. Come on, Mr. Wade. Let's not do anything crazy. Laurie! Ow.Let's hold it right here. I am not breaking in. I got a key, Sherlock. It's not your house.It's not her house either. It's her parents' house and they gave me the key. Laurie! Hello? Hello? Mrs. Wade. I am sorry about this. Is this the house of a sane person? What the hell? I am telling you, she's crazy. Laurie? Still don't want to take sides? Looks like she bought herself a brand new ice pick. Damn it. Can't you keep your hands off anything? If this is ever worth anything as evidence which it wasn't, because we are not supposed to be in here, it's worthless now. Oh, I planted it. That's what you are saying. Just get out of here and let us do our job, okay? Do nothing, that's what you are going to do. Absolutely nothing. You don't think she is dangerous. Her shrink doesn't think she is dangerous. She's going to have to kill somebody before anybody does anything. [PHONE RINGING] Hello. Hello Matthew.MATTHEW: What do you want? Why did you bring the police to my house? What do you want Laurie? Just tell me what you want? Nobody ever told me. MATTHEW: Told you what? What are you talking about? What they wanted. Nobody ever told me. Your life is so perfect, isn't it, Matthew? I bet this is the worst thing that's ever happened to you. [DIALTONE] This is Matthew's agreed- upon settlement to be paid every month for the next three years and he is keeping the house as requested. We have it here and there's no child support, so, that should do it. Thanks a lot.Thank you. Laurie. I need to talk to you about the other night. I am so sorry. I just, sometimes I just, you drive me crazy. I'm sorry. I don't mean to. No, no, no, no, no. I mean, I'm crazy about you. I am really, really crazy about you. Oh, Matthew, please, what are you doing? I am crazy.Oh, God, what are you doing? Stop it. [YELLS] Stop, no, no. Stop it. LAURIE: Help! Help! Help me. Help me. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop it, you bitch. Stop. Help. MATTHEW: I love you.LAURIE: Stop. MATTHEW: Stop it.LAURIE: Please, stop. Don't fight me.Somebody help me. Somebody help me.MATTHEW: Don't fight me. No! [CAR HONKING] MAN: Are you an illegal alien?LAURIE: No. MAN: Are you under indictment for any crime?LAURIE: No. Have you ever been convicted of a felony? No.Are you a fugitive? No. MAN: Have you ever been treated for mental illness? Have you ever been treated for mental illness? No. No, no. Okay. It's nice because it is at the end of the hall. Quieter, you know. Are you sure about this Laurie? You know I love school. Going back will be good therapy. There you go. This is your kitchen. Bath in the back. Here's your living room. Your bed. It's nice. I'll take it. Fine, just stop in the office on the way down and we will fill out the lease. Sure. Look around. Make yourself at home. Just stop down on the way out. You're just starting at Northwestern? Oh, no, it's my second year of graduate work. [INDISTINCT WHISPERING] MATTHEW: Hello? Please protect me. Seven, seven, seven, seven, seven. It's her. MAN: Psycho elevator lady.[LAUGHTER] [KIDS SCREAMING] Sheriff, this just came in the mail for Laurie. Now, it's some kind of follow up for a gun permit or something for God sakes, she's got a gun. We've got some kind of serious problem here. A breakdown or something. Hope you've got a strong stomach. Rotten meat. Refrigerator's full of it. In the cupboards, she carries it around with her. I'll take care of her, thank you. So she went there for six months and only went to class a couple of times and threw hamburger all over the place. So what is that? Health code violation? I talked to a psychiatrist. He tells me that it is a symbol of extreme hostility. Mark her up with symbolism. I thought this was a dead issue. She's got a gun, Chief. Her husband is scared out of his mind. She's been making dozens of hang up calls to him and to his sister. Did you talk to her shrink? She's seen a bunch of them. They keep throwing words at me. Inappropriate affect. Obsessive compulsive, manic depressive, they don't have a clue. But you told them about the gun? Yeah, they don't think she's dangerous, but everybody who knows her says... I'm sorry, John. But there's nothing I can charge her with. So, we don't do anything? Hey, I don't know about you, I got plenty to do. I don't know. I just keep thinking something's going to happen, something horrible, you know? It's all going to be my fault. How does it make you feel, Laurie? I don't know. It's like something's going to happen. Something horrible, you know. It's all going to be my fault. I know, but how does it make you feel? LAURIE: I kind of like the freedom, you know. Well, we know we give you all the privacy you want Laurie. I know Mom, but this is my house, too. Can't you see you are upsetting her? I just think she shouldn't be alone. Why, because you're such great company? Well, I just think it would be better. She just wants to be by herself. What's wrong with that? Thank you, Daddy. She filed a complaint saying I raped her? I haven't even seen her. Don't touch me, don't touch me, stop touching me. Matthew doesn't like the divorce settlement. He's just trying to make her look bad. Seven, seven. No, no, no. She's not some kind of a harmless kook. She's a time bomb and it's ticking. [SOBBING] [LAUGHING] Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. She's not crazy, you know. I spoke to a doctor in Florida who said what she's going through is a very common thing. [GIGGLING] I can't discuss Laurie with you, that's privilege. But I can assure you, as troubled as she is, she's no danger to herself or anyone else. [RIPPING] [CHILD SCREAMS] Kids, come on you guys. Let's go, we've only got about 10 more minutes. WOMAN: Bobby, come on! You want to get some ice cream? No, I'm winning. I got the last one. Hi guys, I'm home. Hi Mom. How was everything?Just fine. I won't need you tomorrow, but how's Friday? Sure, love to. They are just crazy about you. They are great kids. There you go. Thank you. Oh, Laurie, I almost forgot. Can you stay late Friday evening? You don't have a date or anything, do you? My fiance's on nights all week. You're engaged? That's wonderful. Thanks. I'll see you Friday. Mr. Webber, hi, it's good to see you again. I'd like to talk to Laurie if I could. Well, she's sleeping. Oh, okay, that's all right. Maybe it will be better if I talked to you first anyway. Are you aware of the fact that Laurie bought a gun? Oh. Oh, I doubt that very much. That's probably just another one of Matthew's lies. No, sir. I checked out the application. It's definitely Laurie. Oh, is anything wrong with that? Well, obviously, it's dangerous. And I don't think Laurie is the sort of person... She has the right to have it, doesn't she? You can't take away her rights. I'm more concerned with her safety, Mr. Webber. Please, can I just talk to her? Hi Laurie. Got a minute? Your father told me I could talk with you. Oh, well, I was just about to get in the bath. It's okay. It's no problem. Just something I wanted to ask you about. You got a gun, didn't you? You must know I did. Well, I'm kind of worried about that, Laurie. I don't think it's a very good idea. Yeah, I know. I was kind of scared of Matthew for a while, so I got it, but I don't think there's anything to be afraid of anymore. I put it in the bank. JOHN: The bank?LAURIE: Safe deposit box. Well, then... [DOOR OPENS] That's a very good idea. But I think it might be better if you turned it in. Tomorrow maybe I can come and pick you up and we can go by the bank. I have a card that says I can have it.

NEWS REPORTER: One child is known to be dead. As many as seven or eight wounded. Police are tentatively identifying the attacker as a local woman, Laurie Wade.[PHONE RINGING] A police department spokesman said she has a long history of mental instability. Yes. Mom? I don't know what to do. I think you better talk to your father, Laurie. He will be home in a little while. It's terrible. It's really terrible. I'm sorry. I am so sorry for everything. It'll be all right, Laurie. I am sure it'll all work out. Laurie. Hi, my name's Phil Andrew. Can you come over here? I don't have a car. My husband has the car. Can you take a cab? Borrow a neighbor's car? We could use some help. I can't. I really can't. Now, as soon as my husband gets home... Can you get your daughter to give up the gun? We're in danger. All right. That wasn't getting us anywhere. Listen, Laurie, if you let my mom go, she can make sure my sisters don't come in. Okay. PHIL: Go ahead, Mom. Don't hurt him, please. Same caliber. [WOMAN GASPING] She's in your house, isn't she? Bob, take care of her. You want to talk about it? Tell me what happened? Do you think you need help, Laurie? I don't think anyone can help me. You have to help yourself. Or so they all say. I... I... I don't know how to do that. Laurie, I think I can help you. I want to help you. [GUNSHOT] MAN: Come to the front! MAN: Door's opening. Don't move.Hold it. Hold it. Get him out of here. Look, if you don't mind, I'd really rather not see them. Mr. Wade, I'm sorry. I don't know what to say. Is Laurie all right?We think so. The hostages have been released. She's in the house alone. I'd like you to try to talk to her. Yeah. Laurie, I am calling you on the phone. Pick it up. Please. Talk to me, Laurie. Let me know that you... That you are all right. [PHONE RINGING] I am all right, Daddy. I'm all right.[PHONE RINGING] MORT: Can you hear me, Laurie? Why don't you come out? I want to stay here. Can I please just stay here? I want to stay here. Please Daddy. Can I stay? I don't want to go. I feel so sorry for all the mothers of the other children and the families of the other children. I had no idea that Laurie was like this. When I talked to her on the phone, she said to me, "I'm sorry, Mom. "I am sorry for everything, so sorry for everything." What would happen to her if she was arrested? That's something we shouldn't worry about now. If Laurie needs help, she'll get it. I suppose. This sounds terrible for a mother to say, but, you know, she's in so much trouble. I think it would be better if she didn't come out of this alive. Laurie, can you hear me? Why don't you come on out? Come on out, darling. She's not answering. If she has got one chance in a thousand of getting out of there, it's at night. I am not going to take that chance. I am going to get him talking again and give you guys a distraction. Okay. Would you try again? You're not going to hurt her? We are going to do our best not to, I promise. Laurie, why don't, why don't you come out. People here want to help you. We all want to help you. You come out. They can help you, that's all anybody wants. I am calling you on the phone. Pick it up. Please. Just talk to me, Laurie. Let me know that you're all right. Laurie, please talk to me. Pick up the damn phone, Laurie. [PHONE RINGING] MORT: Laurie? Listen to Daddy. Laurie?
