There, now. Hey, buddy. Could you help us move the pallets? Yes. What, have people stopped buying from the Co-op? You could have talked to us. We could have made some kind of deal. Leifur, it’s no business of yours where I buy my paint. Being a little rude, aren’t we? Right, then. You won’t be painting any more houses here. Thanks for the info. Best, Leifur. - Did you call the inseminator? - Yes. - How's 236? - Dimma? Yes. No changes. Maybe we should give her an antidepressant? SUMMER FESTIVAL '85 - A SHORT STORY - Did you order fertilizer? - No. Sprettur is advertising inexpensive fertilizer; 40,000 crowns per ton. Reynir? - Have you looked into that offer? - We belong to the Co-op. Yes, but the Co-op's price is much higher. We can't keep letting the Co-op overcharge us. If we're ever going to pay off our debts, we've got to... Inga, I don't feel like talking about this right now. When was the last time we took a vacation? It's been three years. - He’s in the clear. - Pass it… shoot it! Damn it. He's playing like shit. He played well against Southampton the other day. That was just one game. Did you hear about Bjössi the house painter? No, what? He bought his painting elsewhere and the Co-op has blacklisted him. He's not getting any more jobs. - What? Really? - Yep. Poor Bjössi. Go on, you Reds! You can't keep this up. You've got to talk to him. I know. Just be honest. Tell him you want out. Hello, Reynir. Please come in. Hello. Yes, that's me. What? I'm so sorry. - Where is he? - In here. My deepest condolences, Inga dear. Thank you, Eyjólfur. He was a good man. I just want you to know that we at the Co-op stand behind you. You can always come to me. Who’s looking after the farm? No one. We'll take care of it. Thank you. Reynir decided early on that he was going to be a farmer. After elementary school he started working at Dalsmynni, his parents’ farm. The farm wasn’t big back then, only 20 dairy cows, so there wasn’t much to do during the winter. Reynir worked as a fisherman and did various other jobs. For many years he worked for Sigurjón the carpenter and made a good name for himself. As a young man, Reynir joined the Agrarian Party and always remained loyal to it. It was sometimes said that Armageddon was more likely than Reynir voting for a different party... Reynir was a great team player and was an active member of the Erpsfjörður Cooperative ever since taking over his father's farm at the age of twenty-five... Could the brakes have failed? I don't know, Heiðar. It's all under investigation. I just find it so hard to believe this happened. There must be some explanation. What are you going to do, Mom? Are you going to stay here, or...? I haven't given it any thought. You're welcome to stay with us while you let this settle in. Thank you, dear. Hey, fella. How are you? Aw, are you hungry? You've started fertilizing? The manure pit was full. I'm going to make a few trips. You didn't think to ask first? Oh, you mean... - Leifur told me that... - Leifur? Is he in charge here? - No. - No. You have to ask my permission. This is my equipment. Ok. Eh... Just finish it. Yes. There are a number of unanswered questions regarding this accident. The autopsy didn't reveal anything. We examined the truck, and found nothing wrong with it. There were no marks on the road. In fact, there's no evidence to suggest that he tried to stop the truck. What do you mean? He either fell asleep at the wheel or... ...committed suicide. Did he say anything to you? No. Why didn't he leave a note? THE CO-OP GROCERY STORE BACKSTOP OF THE COUNTY I'd like to put this on Dalsmynni's account. That account has been closed. It's been closed? That can't be. You’re sure you wrote Dalsmynni? Yes. It’s closed. You'll have to pay. What nonsense is this? - Is Eyjólfur here? - Yes, he should be in his office. Inga dear. Please come in. Why has our account been closed? Please, sit down. What’s that now? Your account has been closed? Yeah. That’s what the girl downstairs said. Well, it would be under Reynir’s name. That's probably why. One moment. Dísa, will you reopen the Dalsmynni account and put it under Ingibjörg's name? Yes, please. Thank you. - Thank you. - No problem. Have you thought about your next steps regarding the farm? No. I haven't given it any thought. All in good time. Is Gvendur taking good care of the farmwork? Yes, he's doing just fine. - Thanks so much for the help. - You're welcome. I feel like... I feel like he betrayed me. Left me drowning in debt with the Co-op breathing down my neck. There’s no way that I can pay all our bills. We could hardly manage when it was the two of us, despite working twenty-four seven. If there’s anything I can do to help, just… I think it's best just to declare bankruptcy. Let them take it all. - And what are you going to do? - I don't know. I always told him that this was hopeless. I wanted to move south, to our kids. But he couldn't bear the thought of leaving Dalsmynni. Did you know... what he did for the Co-op? What do you mean? He, ehm... kept tabs on all the shipments around here and informed on anyone who ordered products from Reykjavík. Do you remember when Ási from Brekka ordered fertilizer and the Co-op threatened to stop buying his milk? Was that Reynir? And there were a lot of other instances as well. We spoke the day before he died. He wanted out. Said that he was going to talk to Eyjólfur. Then... I never heard from him again. I just can’t believe this. How could he have done this? They threatened to take away the farm if he didn't do as they said. Hello there. You’re back at it? Back, and taking control. Huh? Thanks for the help, Gvendur. Give my regards to Eyjólfur. THE CO-OP MAFIA - Your article is full of misstatements. - What do you mean by that? - Hi, Kristján. - Hi. - Is everything all right with you? - Yeah. Why do you ask? I heard you've been writing about the Co-op on Facebook. That's right. You should definitely read the article. I'm not on Facebook. Reynir wouldn't have been happy with you, speaking badly of the Co-op. Come again? It's the Co-op that keeps this community alive. You should know that. So they can just do whatever they want? Intimidate and threaten people? You don't know what you're talking about. - Hello. Are you Ingibjörg? - Yes. Hi. I'm Katla, a reporter for Icelandic National Broadcasting. I read your article. It's great. Thanks. - I'd like to interview you. - Interview? Yes, for the evening news. Okay, sure. - You ready? - Yep, ready. Rolling. OK. In your article you compare the Co-op to the mafia, can you tell me what you mean by that? The Co-op is the largest company by far in this area. It own almost everything. Everyone is very dependent on it, especially us farmers. The Co-op buys what we produce. We can't sell it anywhere else. And we have to buy all of our supplies from it. If we do business with other companies, we're in trouble. What do you mean? Well, for example, it threatens to stop buying our milk. And it has threatened to take away the farms of people with heavy debts. It's a mafia. It's said sometimes that nothing happens in Erpsfjörður without the blessing of the Co-op. I think there's a lot to that. The woman who was injured yesterday at Reynisfjara has passed away... Yes, one moment. Leifur. Yes, hello. Yes, I saw it. No. I don't think so. No. Let's not worry about that. She doesn't have any proof. She’s obviously a bit imbalanced. No, we'll just stick to our guns. This will be forgotten in a few days. We'll deal with her later. Yes. Yes, bye. Inga! What’s this God-awful smell? Inga! We’re just gonna use your hot tub here! Freshen up a bit. Come on out you fucking slut. I need to talk to you. Do you know what you are? You’re a fucking stupid whore. Are you hiding? Where are you? She's not home. The lights are out! Wake up, old bitch! Did you forget to teach this boy his manners? Did you tell your dad what you did yesterday? He destroyed four flower pots and two patio chairs. I expect to be paid for them. Inga. I'll make this up to you. - Hello. - Hi. Hi Valdi. I had to slaughter three cows this fall due to udder damage and I know that a lot of others have had similar experiences. Therefore I would the Association of Dairy Farmers to officially oppose the outdoor grazing requirement. Thank you, Siggeir. Does anyone have anything to add on this issue? No? Well. Any other issues? Yes. Ingibjörg? Yes, hello. Um... as I'm sure you all know, I wrote an article the other day. About corruption in the Co-Op, and I'm surprised that there's been almost no discussion about the subject of my article. I feel it's important that we farmers talk about this. It's we who own the Co-op, and I know that some of you have been threatened, and I think it would help our case if more people would step up and tell of their experience. It would be nice to hear what you think about this. OK. Thank you. Yes. Anyone who wants to comment? No. No. Yes. Ásgrímur? I'd like to talk a bit about fences... It so happens that a lot of the fences in this area are old and in disrepair, and... and we farmers can't afford to keep them in shape... So... You have to let this go. It isn't helping anyone. Least of all you. What do you mean? You just lost your husband and I understand how you must feel. - But you can’t blame it all on the Co-op. - I just can’t let this go on. This community is sick, Friðgeir. No one dares to say anything. Everyone just goes along with them. But they all know what’s going on. What about you and Kolbrún? Are you just OK with this? OK with being slaves to the Co-Op? - Of course not. - Right. The same thing could happen to you as it did to Reynir. What are you going to do if they show up one day and ask you to do something for them? Huh? What are you going to do then? - I don't know. - Right. Did you have to order this from Reykjavik? I'm busy. What do you want? My boss isn't really pleased with you. That article the other day and now this. I save 300,000 crowns by buying fertilizer from them. Which means I can pay off my debts faster. - You want me to pay off my debts, right? - Yes. Of course. But we also want you to buy from us. Then why don't you lower the price of the fertilizer? This is a warning. If you want to keep living here, you need to think about what you're doing. There’s something I need to tell you. What happened to your father... wasn't an accident. It looks as if he committed suicide. - Nice weather today. - Yes. I saw some plovers on the way. At Stóra-Gil. - Have you seen any plovers? - No. It was interesting, reading your article. Mafia. That's a fairly big word. What would you call it but "mafia" when you intimidate people and threaten them with violence? I don't think you really understand what this is about. It's about protecting the County. Keeping the profit generated by the community within the community. But isn't it taking things too far to prohibit people from doing business with other companies? If you belong to the Co-op, you're a part of the communal whole. You deposit into the Co-op and withdraw from the Co-op. If you assume that the Co-op will be there to support you, but go and do business somewhere else, it's a dead end. If the Co-op goes bankrupt, all trade and services here will crumble to nothing. Do you think the big chains in Reykjavík have any interest in opening here? Society is changing, Eyjólfur. Young people don't want to commit themselves to some cooperative. They just buy things from Amazon. Do you think my kids would want to take over some heavily indebted robotic barn, if they were offered much better jobs in Reykjavík? You've never been much of a Co-op person. And I respect your views. But if you try to blame us for how things have gone with the robotic barn... You encouraged farmers to produce more milk and switch to robotic milking systems. Was it our fault that the economy collapsed? Are we responsible for extortionate interest rates and indexation? We saved you from bankruptcy. Don't forget that. You should probably have let us go bankrupt. Maybe Reynir would still be alive, then. I know what was going on. I know exactly what you made him do. Reynir was a true Co-op man. What he did for us, he did willingly. You're probably right. We should let you go bankrupt. Thanks for the coffee. Hi, Inga. Have you quit blogging? God damn it. What are you doing? - Inga just posted on Facebook. - Hm? She has completely lost it. - Who? - Inga. - Look. - What is this? That's Inga's Facebook page. No longer selling the Co-op my milk. Any buyers? - Is this some kind of joke? - I don't think so. Has she been joking a lot lately? And what… is she going to sell the milk herself? - On Facebook? - Looks like it. ...it's just not according to normal procedures... What are you doing? Come on out. What? Am I under arrest? Yes. You’re under arrest for property damage. Hey, relax. - Let's go, Inga. - Get your hands off me... Open it. Inga. Are you willing to answer a few questions? Why did you spray milk on the Co-op building? My tank was full. I had to get rid of it. You made an announcement that you were done selling the Co-op your milk. Why? I've simply had enough of this monopoly. We farmers should stop selling them our milk and start processing and selling our products ourselves. The Co-op director, Eyjólfur Konráðsson, has ignored our repeated requests to interview him concerning this matter. Hi. Yes. I'm at home. Yeah. OK. Yes, I'll come. Yeah. OK. Bye. No question about it. - Everybody welcome. - This could be fantastic. Hi Inga. - Hi. - Hi. What are you guys doing here? We've been talking about you, - the Co-op, all sorts of stuff. - I see. We've been... ...we've been wondering how we might end this Co-op monopoly. The idea came up that we could found a dairy farmers' cooperative. A cooperative owned by - and administrated by farmers. - Right. Like the Co-op used to be. How do you start a dairy farmers' cooperative? First of all, we need to get people on our side. There's a great deal of discontent with the Co-op. Even though people are afraid to express it out loud. I think there's a lot of people who would support it, someone just has to take the first step. We thought we might go through the Association of Dairy Farmers. - Eyjólfur has no influence there. - Eyjólfur has influence everywhere. - Yes, but it's an independent association. - Right. The general meeting is next week. We could advance a motion that the Association establish its own dairy farmers' cooperative. That's a great idea. I'm in. Like I expected anything else. The revolutionary herself! Of course she’s on board. Who’s going to be in charge of this? Well, we haven't discussed that yet. Do we need a new dairy farmers' cooperative? Isn't it fine that the Co-op takes care of it? - Are you happy with the Co-op? - Yes. It has always been good to us. Yes. Always. We believe that it's better for farmers to be able to choose where they sell their milk. That there's not just one entity available. That we have healthy competition. Good afternoon Loftur. Afternoon. - How are you? - Just fine. We would like to have a word with you. May we come in? You may come in, Friðgeir, but this woman is not entering my house. I'll just wait in the car. Hi Brúsi. - How are you? - I'm good. Hi. Listen, we’ve been going around talking to people about an idea for - a new dairy farmers’ cooperative. - Oh. Well. Who's with you in this? Siggeir at Vellir, Gunnar at Egilsstaðir, - my wife, and... - Yes. - I like it. - Yes? It's time we shook up this system. Absolutely. - Will you come to the meeting, then? - I sure will. Hello. Hello. How's the situation? Not particularly good. If I'm to be honest. They've talked to a lot of people and... seem to be gaining ground. Some are planning to support the proposal. Who would that be? Bogi at Langstaðir, - Tóti at Ferjunes... - Tóti? I just loaned him money for a strapping machine. Damn it. Who else? - I don't really remember. - You don't remember? Maybe we should just let it go? Even if their proposal is approved, they’re never going to get it off the ground. How would they fund it? When I was at Cooperative College, I took a course on horticulture taught by Þorsteinn Björnsson. Þorsteinn always said that you should go after the weeds, tear them up by the roots, before they can spread. We’re not going to let the weeds take over, are we Leifur? No. - We spoke to Jónas at Oddgeirsstaðir today. - Yes? He offered us cake and cookies. Wow, luxury! - Was his coffee watery as usual? - I could see to the bottom of the cup. No surprise there. - Did you manage to persuade him? - I don’t know. He said he would think about it. - Jónas is not going to oppose Eyjólfur. - You don’t think so? No, there’s no way. - Absolutely no way. - You’re probably right. That’s how he is. Anyone up for a shot? Something stronger. Have some. A few days ago, the idea came up to establish a new dairy farmers' cooperative. The idea has been taken quite well. In fact much better than we expected. I'm not a very optimistic person by nature, but I'm fairly optimistic that we'll succeed. Absolutely. I want to propose a toast to one particular woman. Who took the initiative in this struggle. It’s thanks to her that we’re here. Here's to Inga. Cheers! To Inga! Are these people Association members? They're former dairy farmers. They have the right to vote. Let's go. Next on the agenda is a proposal for the establishment of a dairy farmers' cooperative. Ingibjörg Halldórsdóttir will now present the proposal. Welcome, Ingibjörg. Dear colleagues. In 1893 a cooperative was founded in Erpsfjörður. It was founded by poor farmers who were dissatisfied with the business monopoly that had controlled things until then. With the introduction of the Co-op, the farmers' circumstances improved; they got higher prices for their products and were able to import products themselves. In the Co-op, the cooperative ideal was the guiding light, and everyone had a say. One man. One vote. However, over time, things changed. The Co-op is no longer the democratic institution it once was. It is controlled by a small clique, and in particular, one man. The Co-op is rife with corruption and abuse of power. Those who dare to criticize it pay the price, as I have personally experienced. It has actually become exactly like the monopolistic trade companies that it was originally created to oppose. Dear colleagues. It's time to re-shuffle the deck. Time for us farmers to retake control. It's time to found a new dairy farmers' cooperative. Eyjólfur is here. What is he doing here? I don't know. The floor is open. What's going on? The Co-op director, Eyjólfur, has asked to speak. Excuse me. Don't you have to be a member to speak? Shut up, man! This is a violation of Association rules! He's not allowed to speak! Let the man speak and sit down! That’s right! He doesn’t have permission to speak. - This is bullshit. - Complete rubbish. Ladies and gentlemen. Earlier, heavy things were said about the Co-op, and about me personally. It is not very magnanimous to attack a person who doesn't have the chance to defend himself. The proposal being tabled here today causes me great concern. It has not been carefully thought out, and those who stand behind it cannot be trusted to run a business. This dairy farmers' cooperative will end up bankrupt, just like Inga's farm, Dalsmynni. They talk about a lack of competition. But the fact is that we are facing fierce competition. We are competing with the big chain stores in Reykjavík. And we are putting up a strong fight, because we are united. We are united in one partnership. If our unity is broken, we are finished. The farms here will end up abandoned. And the County will become nothing more than a place for summer cottages. - Do we want that? - No, no, no. If that's what you want, then you should agree to this proposal. But if you want to live in a strong, independent County, with a strong infrastructure and economy, then you will say NO. Can those of you who wished to speak raise your hands again? No one wishes to add anything? Then we shall proceed to the vote... Wait! I would like to say a few words about Reynir. My husband. You all knew him, and know how he was. What sort of man he was. I know that some of you have ordered products from “undesirable” companies and come under fire from the Co-op for it. And it's very likely that my husband was the one who ratted on you. But he didn't do so willingly. He was forced to by Eyjólfur. Eyjólfur threatened to take away our farm. And you all know how much Dalsmynni meant to Reynir. Now, Reynir is no longer with us, but I'm certain he's here in spirit. And I'm... I'm certain that he would have supported our proposal. Because Reynir wasn't just a Co-op man. He was also a decent man who wanted to live in a good, upright community. Thank you. Well, now... now I think the time has come for the vote. Those who are for the proposal hold up your hands. Thank you. Those who are opposed... Thanks. The proposal has been approved by a majority vote. There you go girl. Yes. Are you all hungry? There you go. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. - Are you Ingibjörg? - Yes. Hi, my name is Finnbogi, from the County Commissioner’s office. This is a bankruptcy and eviction order issued on behalf of the Erpsfjordur Co-op. I just need your signature, acknowledging receipt, please. Thanks. Thank you so much. I always hope for gladder days, don't want to die so sad, I can't let boredom do me in or drive me downright mad. Monday's tough; by Tuesday, the ball begins to roll, come Thursday Friday Saturday I'm out to lose control. The weekend's time to have a blast, get wild, just let go, then come Sunday settle down, take things nice and slow. Time for me to live my life, be happy and be free. Now's the time to leave this place, I've got the world to see.
