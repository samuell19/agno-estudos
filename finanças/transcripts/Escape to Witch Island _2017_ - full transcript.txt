It was 1969, and my world was about to change forever. Mom had to move us away from dad and onto the reservation. I felt sad and worried. New school, new kids, and no dad. Come on you two lose the long faces. Tommy, Jett, let's go. Hey, Tommy. What do think the kids are like here? I don't know, and I don't care. I only found peace in nature. It was my go-to happy place. Children, children. Settle down. We have two new students joining us today. Sit right there. And you, young lady, right over here. My name is Sister Mary. Now you introduce yourself. Okay. Um. Hi. My name is... My name is Jett. Like an airplane? Children, settle down. Hey, look, there's that new girl! You're so white. Hey, you're see through! Runaway, Jett! Just play the game. Okay, Jett, your turn to drive. Get over here. Come on, all you gotta do is keep it between the lines. Okay. There we go. We're almost there. Yep, just stay on the road. Good job. Now here. Turn her. Oh, no. What is wrong with you? What, she did great! Mom was right. You do have a speck the size of Texas on your brain. If you're gonna continue to hurt yourself, so be it. But don't take the kids with you! Leave me alone! It was at that moment that I gave up on dad. Ow. Ow. Ouch. Stinging nettles, a trap is set. They have been trained to sting intruders. You better leave this place or sufferer the consequences. Mom! Mom! Are you home? Alright, out with it. Come on spill the beans. People around here don't like Jett. What do you mean? Of course, they do. Sometimes it just takes people a little while to get to know each other that's all. May I please be excused, please? Continue reading. Let's get out our tablets and pencils. Write the alphabet as you see it on the blackboard. There is no writing with your left hand, Jett. It isn't proper. Choose your battles, Tommy boy. There we go. Now start from the beginning. You must finish before you are allowed to go to lunch. You may be excused. You're excused. You boys are excused. Hello. We don't belong here. This is where you belong. Hide. Don't let anyone see you. 'Cause this, this is your home. Oh, hello. Guardian spirit dance. You know, you're never there for me, especially, especially when I need you. You know, you two what can you hear? Listen. You can hear the sunset. Hats off. Thank you. You may start. Might as well sleep in the bushes and trees. You spend all your time there. That's not true. I spend plenty of time all around the rest. All trees. - Do not! - Do not! - Do to! - Do to! Hey, hey, hey, hey. - Jinx! - Stop it you two. - Stop it! - Gotcha. Jett. Dad. I miss you. Show me a sign that you're still here with me. Come on, for me. Come on. See you have to whisper to 'em. Where are you? But, Dad. Can't you just set them free. You have more than enough to feed a whole village. Please? Jett. Please? Jett, you need to learn to feed yourself. Fish are here to be our food. But, it just doesn't feel right. - Fishy, fishy, fishy. - Stop that! - Fishy, fishy. - Put it down, put it down before you drop it! - Fishy, fishy. - Put it down! Do you wanna eat dinner or not? No, thanks. More for us, huh, Tommy? Yeah. Go now. Come back as a as a bird. Okay, kids it's time to go. Here, Jett, this is for you. Someday you'll thank me for this. Dad, I miss you. Ready. Show me a sign that you're still here. Come on out. There you go. Protect our house and our garden. Thank you. Go outside! We can go outside! Yeah, come on! Yeah! We want sun, yeah! It had been the worst school year. Bullies had made sure of it by teasing me relentlessly every single day. Hello. Can you understand me? You can? Great. Thank you. The tree's and wind's reply frightened me at first. It was only the beginning of Mother Earth speaking back to me. I could understand what she was telling me. Uncle Ralph, the watchman, knew it too. It was later told to me that he went straight to tell The Medicine Man who only spoke in his native tongue and his nephew, the interpreter. The watchman is here. The wind, the animals, the trees, and the plants move in a way only of a watchman. That's not possible. No one has moved the earth movements like that in many years. No. I saw it. I saw it with my own eyes. We will ask the gods the truth. I knew it. I knew it was her. - Her? - Yes. She's maybe nine, 10. That could not be. It will never be. Elder, of all people you must understand. You must understand. Doggone it, where is it? Hey, get out of there! No. Please, can I come with you? Ugh, let go. You know the rules. Boys only. Why? Jett, I'm off to campus. There's a pimento cheese sandwich on the counter and a list of chores you need to get done before your Gram and cousin Peedie arrive. Chores? I don't wanna do chores. Hermit crabs. Hello. It's okay, it's me. How you doing? Me too. Well, nice seeing you. Remember hide from the humans, except for me. Uncle Ralph would stand on the cliffs and docks for hours gazing out to sea. Hi, there. Hi. How are you doing? I guess, that's what a watchman does. Did you ask the fog what she thinks? How do you know that she has a voice? She does. Like all living things. The fog is one of the few places beyond the great cave where all living things can come together equal as one. There's comfort in the fog. She is like a blanket. Animals, plants, and trees know it too. Bye. I better get home. Bye. We'll see you. Onie, honey. - Mom. - Hello, darling. Oh, my god, it's so good to see you. Wonderful to see you here. Peedie, look at you. - Oh, my god. - Gram! Honey, it's so good to see you. Let me look at you. - Oh, my goodness. - Look at you. Your cheeks are so cold. You must have grown a whole hand since I've seen you last. We still need to set an appointment to get this hair done. Now give me some sugar under that chin. Oh, honey. - Tommy. - Peedie! - Tommy. - Tommy. - Hi, cowboy. - Hi, Tommy. You have grown into a fine young man. Mom, mom, mom, mom! Let's get some of that sugar. - Oh, Tommy. - Please, please, please! Peedie in my room? Yes, yes. - Yes, yeah! - Go. Come on I'll show you! Oh, Onie. - Mom. - It's so good to see you. Hello, my friend. Hey, let's go take a closer look at this guy's canoe. Canoe? What canoe? Here. Whoa. Let's go. A great spirit spoke to me this morning. The voice came on the water, and lifted through the air on the orca. The eagle took the words and spread 'em across the water and land. This one here needs your help to restore her to her natural beauty. In turn, someday she'll help you. Shh. Gee whiz, Peedie. I'm sorry, Jett, there are twigs everywhere. Who goes there? Speak now or forever hold your tongues if you're lucky. We brought you a peace offering of fudge sickles. We thought. Well, maybe in exchange you could let us join the fort gang. Quick! - Yeah! - Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! - Run Jett run. - Yeah. Go Jett run! Yeah! - Yeah! - Good job, guys. - Yeah. - Here, Tommy, get one. Yeah! Yeah! That was close. I couldn't understand why the wind, plants, and trees didn't help us on the day that dad died. Why didn't you help us? Wait, who are you talking to? Why? Dad, I think there's something wrong with the brakes. They're fine, Jett. There's smoke. I think, they're broken. Dad! Jett. What's wrong? Jett, what's wrong? So, what happened? Let me help you. You must learn the right time and way to ask. I understood what Uncle Ralph was telling me. It is a knowing and understanding that we are part of everything, and everything is part of us. We are all one. Men, you have to believe. You have to become the bush. Be the bush. My arms are getting tired. Men, three steps to the left. Nope, still not a great view. Men, three steps to the right. Perfect. Peedie. Fort gang. Why do you allow yourselves to fear those boys. That guy has eyes in the back of his head. Not him the island. Oh, that. That's Witch's Island. Yeah, my dad told me about it. Said we should never go there. Why? Duh, dingle berry, it's Witches Island. What else do you need to know? My dad said it's treacherous. How would he know? You don't even know what that word means! Yeah, and even if you make it to sure... There's no way to get off the island, unless... The witch decides. Only she can show you. That is even more ridiculous. Peedie, I have an idea. Come. Just come on. Whoa. Oh, wow. Danger do not open. Okay. Peedie. Peedie, you're not going to believe what I just found. What's that you have there, Jett? Think fast. - Get her! - Come on, guys. Go, go, go. Bingo. What the? Split! I bet she's lying around - here somewhere. - Jett. This is impossible. She hasn't been to the island to speak with The Great Elder or even entered the cave. You're wrong. Women have always been able to see, hear, and heal. It's time we all remembered that. After the truth Uncle Ralph shared, I felt sorry for The Medicine Man. Maybe he was lost between worlds just like me. Okay, go. Okay, hit it. Where have you been? What have you done now? Are you okay, Sweetheart? Does it look like I'm okay? Everything's falling apart. Maybe this was a bad idea. You have to go. It is work. I know. It's just that I haven't been away from the kids since Thomas, and I'm just worried to leave that's all. Things will get better, Onie. The kids will work it out. They'll find their way. I know. Besides we're gonna have a ball. It's summer break. I'm here. What can possibly go wrong? You're not making me feel any better about this trip, Mom. You gotta go. You could lose your job if you don't. She okay? Yes, I think so. She's just upset she has to take this trip away from the kids. She'll be okay. She's a Chase, after all. Get in, gently. Is it true these canoes are made out of a single tree? Cedar, but our country. What did you learn from The Medicine Man? I'm not sure. Deep down I knew there was something I needed to do. I had to find The Great Elder, and Thunderbird, that canoe we were sitting in, was going to take me there. You have a lot to learn about the water before you attempt to travel on her. Come on, let's walk over to my house. I'll tell you more of our stories while I fix those glasses. Wow. They're perfect. Thanks, Uncle Ralph. You're welcome. Thank you, so kindly, Ralph. You're welcomed too. What does a watchman actually do? Keep's watch over the village and out to the ocean and beyond, a protector, a teacher, and you have to be able to understand all animals, plants, a lot of them and just be able to understand all movement. I've heard it said that the watchman has supernatural powers, and that they can hear and see in all directions at once. And that they can get information from plants, animals, wind, waters, land. Yes, but that's only half of it. The watchman guides the new knew watchman too, and they share the secrets of The Great Elder, who speaks only half of Mother Earth. So, I have shared a few of our stories, and I will share many more with you throughout the summer. Where's Cougar Point? Have you ever been to Witch's Island? I love your stories. Cougar Point is just up the beach. Witch's Island is a very powerful and sacred place and off limits. Whoa, these are huge. Peedie, you have to see this. Is that what I think it is? Hmm-mm, it's Witch's Island. That is where The Great Elder is. Let's get some binoculars, so we can see better. Hey, they just ran to your house. Give me that. You're spoiling the fun, as usual. Men, pack up. We've got us some hunting to do. Come on, Peedie, I'll help you. Put that down. We're almost to the beach. What if they... A little more. They'll come after us still. Come on, Peedie! Look! Come on! Let's get out of here. I don't wanna get beat up again. Come on, Peedie! There she is. Peedie, you have to see this. I just know. I know that is where The Great Elder is. Come on, Peedie. Peedie? The fort gang boys. Now we have our first prisoner. - Yeah! - Yeah! Prisoner! - Yeah. - Yeah. Now we have a bargaining chip. Wait bargain for what? How did you know they'd be down at the beach, Tommy? It's Jett favorite place, duh. You're gonna get in big trouble for this, Tommy. You broke my glasses again. So what. I think I can. I think I can. I have no fear. I can do this. I can do this. Instead of asking for help, this time I thanked the wind, trees, bushes, and animals. They moved for me like I had never seen before. It felt like magic. Jett. Oh, Jett. We know you're out there. The dumb wind gave you a way. What do you want? Well, let me think. I got it! After much consideration, we've decided that you must go to Witch's Island. You must bring back items from the island. But wait, you must also bring back items from the witch. But that's not fair. She can't go to Witch's Island alone. It's too dangerous. Just get in your little canoe and paddle as hard as your little arms can. Oh, that's not cool, man. That is not cool. Fine. If we go to Witch's Island and get all that stuff that you want, Peedie and I assume control of this fort. Okay, we will release Peedie for now. But you must report for duty. You now work for us. Come on, let's go. Dad's camping stuff is down here somewhere. Jett, I'm scared. We don't know what we're doing. Besides even if we do, I still don't think that this is a good idea, in general, I mean. Here. See, we have everything we need. Don't worry, Peedie. I have to find The Great Elder. I suppose. It is just a camping trip, right? Yeah. But I still think. Wait. I'll grab sandwiches. Let's go. Look. What? There, there. Let's go. Jett, what's wrong? Look. Whoa, there is something way, way bigger than us. This is your doing? Why couldn't you listen. You alienate everyone with your old beliefs and judgments. You pushed too far, too soon. And with that Uncle Ralph finally told The Medicine Man what he had wanted to since being sent to Witch's Island so many years ago. Mother Earth intervened sending her hand, The Great Elder, to help guide the frightened young Ralph. I'm sure they'll come in soon. We all did stuff like this as kids. That's what summers are for. I suppose you're right. I just wish anyway would've checked in with me first, that's all. Thunderbird! She's gone! What? Great, now what are we gonna do? Look, there! - Whoa. - Whoa. That's a sign. It's gotta be this way. Let's go. Okay. Look there. Almost there. Jett, my feet hurt. Come on, Peedie. Just a little bit longer. We're almost there. Whoa. I just know that's gotta be where The Great Elder is. It just has to be. Whoa. Shh, look. We nearly got caught. I know. It's okay now. I'm starting to think he's not a witch. It's highly improbable. For no one has ever proven that witches ever existed. There are many discussions regarding this, but usually it comes downs to... Enough already! I just wanna eat in silence. Fine, have it your way. Here. Hey, there, Ralph. Hey, Emilio. What is it this time, Ralph? You see another warning from the sky? Oh, let me guess. You wanna have another clambake at the beach or maybe fix some old canoes. Seriously, man, you may not like this. My canoe is gone. The kids are missing. We'll head over right now. This one itches, Jett. I know. Mud, dip our hands in the water and then rub dirt on them. All right. Okay, this should help. We have to get going. Why? We have to find The Great Elder. Let's split up. Jett, that may not be a very good idea. There are animals and who knows what else. It's okay, just stay to the water's edge, so I can find your tracks. Jett, I do have a good feeling about this. We'll, be okay. I'll find you. Uh-oh. Looks like you've caught some poison oak. You got some treasure. It's a Thunderbird. Now we should take care of that for you. I got some potion at the cabin. It's gonna get worse, let's go. Look those welts are gonna get real bad. I don't bite. But I think the cougars do. I walked for what seemed like hours in search of The Great Elder. And finally there she was. She was sacred and adorned with the most beautiful shells and eagle feathers. I had finally found her. But now what? What is all this stuff? A novel that I'm working on. You're a writer not a witch? A witch? Not a witch I suspected so. Nah, I like to come here to write, so I can get away. We'll, let's just say I like being alone. A witch? The kids all said you're a witch. Why? Probably because you live on Witch's Island. Witch's Island. Looks like your friends have made a lot of assumptions. Except, I said all the kids not my friends, so. So what are you trying to say you don't have friends? One. Really who's that? Jett. Jett. That's a cool name. Here you can do it yourself. The summer storm came out of nowhere. I figured as long as I was with The Great Elder, I was safe. Hey, it's okay. The summer storms don't last long. What's wrong? My cousin, Jett, she's out there somewhere. I'll be back. So how come you guys came out here by yourselves? The fort gang boys dared us. Who? You know, the fort gang boys, they build the coolest forts. So basically you were bullied to coming out here. Just, we have to earn it before we're accepted. Jett also has to visit The Great Elder. The great elder. We heard The Medicine Man say so. What? He doesn't believe about the watchman or about Jett. Really? Well, Peedie, I'm gonna have to ask you to be brave for me. I need you to close your eyes, and when you wake I will have your cousin here. They found Uncle Ralph's canoe, Thunderbird, adrift between islands with two life jackets floating nearby. Looks like they drowned. Looked like a drowning incident. Did you check Witch's Island? No sign of them there either. No one would listen to Uncle Ralph. Most people didn't believe in the traditions of the tribe anymore. He was the only one who thought we were still alive, and we were, for the moment. You boys may have noticed one of your cohorts is not here today. That's because he's found himself extremely grounded by me. You all are in big, big trouble. You best be gettin' on home, now! Get. I'm home. Good golly that was a long drawn out week. What's happened? Someone please tell me. Mom. Where's Jett? Where's Jett? Mom. Mom. Isn't this a little premature? Just stop, Ralph. Nobody believes in that stuff anymore. The watchman, the boogie man, The Medicine Man, whatever you wanna call it. Those are the old days. You're wrong. Peedie, wake up. Peedie, wake up. We have to get going. Maybe he won't notice us if we go right now. Let's go. Leaving without saying goodbye? No. No. It's just our Gram shall be really worried. We don't wanna do that to her. I understand. But you and I need to have a talk. Okay. I hear you have a connection with Mother Earth, and you've been searching outside for the Great Elder? How does he know? What? The Great Elder? It's in here with you always. She's told me who you are. But with your knowledge I was teaching this. You understand. Is there anything you see in here that you like? It's yours. It's mine. Mm-hmm. Thank you. You're welcome. You shouldn't worry about proving yourself to others in order for them to accept you. The best you can do is learn to listen, speak the truth, love the world and all the people on it, and acceptance was right here. You know, you can choose to be whoever you wanna be. That choice is yours, and yours alone. You promise you'll listen? Yes. And not judge? Yes. Always look in search for the truth. 'Cause the truth will always come forward. Okay, let's get you home. I felt like I could see all the way across the water right into Uncle Ralph's eyes. I know you're there. But something told me that this was his necklace, and he stood right here before. Remember, believe. Jett, I'm tired. Peedie, listen. Do you hear that? Peedie, just keep paddling please. We're almost there. Not too far now. Jett. We're sinking. Can you swim? No. Listen we're close. I remember everything I learned from the Great Elder and Uncle Ralph. Peedie, it's gonna be okay. It's okay. I'll go get help. As I swam away from Peedie, I think the water, Mother Earth, and the embrace of the fog he was right. I did find comfort in the fog. I felt no fear. Peedie! That summer we learned how to believe again. It became the legend of the watchman's canoe.
