How come you are here? l have been looking for you. What is it about? The police chief and Kindaichi are here. They have something important to tell. They ask us to go back at once. l'll go back now. Don't use your boat. The chief is impatient. Then what about this boat? l'll ask someone to come and get it later. Come on up. All right then. Who. . . who is it? Say something! Have you finished eating? Yes. lt was delicious. l made all of them. Which one did you like? The raw egg. What?! How could you. . . Didn't you promise me not to come here? lt's chaos in the lnugami family now. l'm sure you've heard of it. lt must be hard for you. This is the last time. Leave here at once. l will do as you say. This might be the last time we meet in this lifetime. Take care. Mr. Kindaichi, l need to clean the room. ls there a university in this town? Yes, there is. Really? The professor of the university comes here once in a while to play chess with the owner of the hotel. That's great. Why? Can you do me a favour? l need you to check something for me. Be the assistant of a detective? According to the biography of Sahei, The business of lnugami Medicine had huge improvement during the wartime like wars of Nisshin, Nichiro, and World War l Did they produce narcotics? Mustard seed. Opium and heroin could be abstracted from mustard seed. Mr. Sahei got special permission of making them. Army was the heavy buyer of these narcotics. The narcotics of lnugami are weapons equal to bombs and guns on the battlefield. Saruzo? Yes. You are Saruzo, right? Are you in boathouse right now? Tamayo is now in an empty house at Toyohama. Do you know the first mansion of lnugamis? Tamayo is in coma. Please come at once. Don't let the others know. Come by yourself. Hey, you. . . Goharu. . . Goharu. l have been waiting for you. Thank you. You must be starving. Have some more. Did you get to meet the professor? Yes. Great. Have some more. Did the professor write this message? That's right. l see. The toxic is an alkaloid compound. Have some more. Shape like a white crystal. The murder put toxic in the smoke. This is a funny compound. Funny? What else did the professor say? He said it's impossible to do analysis now since there are components distilled from herbs. l see. Continue to eat. Did he mention if this has anything to do with mustard? He said this toxic is similar to the structure of hydrochloric morphine. Really? Continue to eat. What is it? Don't you want to eat anymore? l have no time to eat at all. Really? Bill, please. Let me pay for it. No. l should pay for what l eat. l said no. Let me buy you this meal to thank you. Master, sorry to disturb you. l didn't get to practice much since l was sick most of the time last year. Let's start now. Can l start playing from the beginning? Of course. How come she still has the mood to play Harp with people dying? Where is Suketomo? How come he's not back yet? Where have you been? ls it Sukekiyo? l head you were demobilized. You must have suffered a lot. lt's late to say now, l heard calamities have happened in your family. l feel sorry for you. lt's okay. This world is full of calamities. Only bad things reported in the newspapers. A blind woman like me don't really bother about it. That's why l live a happier life. Sayoko. The rain is heavy. Suketomo has been missing since last night. Now that you mention it, the last time l saw him was yesterday. Let me look for him. Suketomo is not a rat, why would he hide in a room like this? Give me your hand. Thank you, l'm fine. This is cruel. . . Sir, this is not the crime scene. So the murderer moved the body again! That's right. Because none of the tiles is broken. lt's the string of Harp. Was he strangled to death? Maybe it was made to look like he was strangled. After chrysanthemum is Harp. Chief, this is your responsibility! When you suspected that l was the murderer, the real murderer killed my son! l'm sure Tamayo is the murderer! How could you simply say that? You're disturbing the investigation. Do you believe what she said? Did Suketomo look like someone who would try drug rape? l am his mother. l know him well! Tamayo lied to protect herself! She doesn't have the strength to bring the body to the rooftop. Saruzo did that. Sister Matsuko, are you happy now? l'm sure you are. Both Suketake and Suketomo are dead. Only left your son Sukekiyo. Everything goes as you will. Chief, is it true that there was a string strangled at the neck of Suketomo? Yes. But the weapon that strangled him should be a much thicker rope. Chrysanthemum at first, this time is Harp. Which means. . . The axe. . . The Harp. . . Chrysanthemum. . . What are you trying to say? Sister Matsuko, in order to revenge for Suketomo and Suketake, l will tell that incident right now. Three of us have different mothers. None of them get to become the official wife of our father. They were just three women who were kept like toys by the man. But our father had sex relationship with a woman younger than us. She is a worker in our factory, Aonuma Kikuno. Kikuno gave birth to a son. And father have given the three heirlooms of lnugami, the axe, harp and chrysanthemum to him. We couldn't forgive that. ln order to get the heirlooms back, three of us went to the village they stayed. Three heirlooms are used to revenge. Takeko and the others thought it has something to do with the murders. But what they did was terrible. Desire is rather fearful. Right, Senba? Yes. Mr. Furudate, where have Kikuno and her son gone? Kikuno went to Toyama to look for her relative. After a while, she died of sickness. What a poor woman. l heard Shizuma joined the army. But there is no news of him ever since. Really? l get it now. The demobilized soldier must be Aonuma Shizuma, who is also the murderer! ln order to get the legacy, he killed one after another. Senba! Yes sir. Send a hue and cry on him. Yes sir. Axe, harp and mum were derived from Nomomiya Dainishinkan Shinto few generations ago. People make the gold axe, harp and mum to be the treasure of the Shinto. When lnugami Sahei first founded his company, Dainishinkan gave them to him as a gift. They are usually kept in the Shinto, right? Yes. What is this? Good things keep coming. The blessing has become a curse now. What l'm concerned now, there's the axe left. You mean, another murder case is going to happen? Oyama-sama, in order to stop it from happening, can you please tell me the relationship of Nomomiya Daini and the lnugamis? Me? l couldn't believe at first about what happened to Tamayo. l kept my mouth shut and never mention it to anyone. l only tell you. When l checked on this old book, it stated the abnormal relationship between Mr. Sahei and Nomomiya Daini. Although Nomomiya Daini-sama had a wife, he never liked a woman. That's why Sahei was favoured by Daini. Sometime later, Sahei slept with Haruyo, the virgin wife of Daini. They had a child called Noriko. She was the mother of Tamayo. That's why Mr. Sahei cared so much about Tamayo. Because she is his real granddaughter. The financial giant in Shinshu had an unknown past. Mr. Furudate, in my opinion, the murder cases happened right now were all planned by Sahei. Kindaichi. . . Sahei passed away 7 months ago. How could he. . . That's right. l wonder why l think that way. . . The woman he loved most was the wife of his benefactor. Sahei managed to accumulated money, women and power. lt's all because of the greed of human. Tamayo, have you made up your mind? Since Suketake and Suketomo are dead, only Sukekiyo could marry you now. So, tell me your answer now. Why are you not talking? You have no other way now. l refuse. What?! Do you know what you are talking about? You'd lose your inheritance if you don't get married with Sukekiyo. Aunt Matsuko, his man is not Sukekiyo. Sukekiyo! Mom. . . l am Sukekiyo. Where have you been? l have been looking for you. l want to talk to you. Let's go to the warehouse. Come on. Sukekiyo. How dare she say you are not my son?! That's crazy! Tamayo was lying. What am l thinking? Right, Sukekiyo? Say something. What Tamayo said was true. Your favourite Sukekiyo was missing. Then who are you? Well, l am Aonuma Shizuma. The son of Aunoma Kikuno whom you and your sisters insulted. Shizuma! My mom died when l was nine. She was still cursing you before she died. l have sworn l must revenge to the lnugamis. l want to revenge for my mother! lsn't this like a comeuppance? l met your son Sukekiyo on the battlefield. l approached him on the battlefield in Burma. We have the similar face and view from the back. We became close friends. Your son is a good man. The war became drastic. Our troop lost a lot of soldiers. His troop completely collapsed. l was disfigured and barely survived. At the time, it was my hatred towards the lnugamis kept me hanging on. l made a decision then. l would return to lnugami family as Sukekiyo. That's interesting. l want to play too. Be careful. Hey, lift it up. l can't see his face. Cleanse it with water. Was it really the body of Sukekiyo? Yes. His head was chopped by an axe. The murderer has completed the revenge of axe, harp and mum. Kindaichi, why are you in a rush? l just read the papers. Yes, Sukekiyo is dead. Where have you been? You didn't return to your hotel last night, did you? Yes. Chief, can you get me the fingerprints of the right hand of the victim? You too? Tamayo said the same thing. Tamayo? The hand print we got earlier did match the hand print kept in Shinto. That's the problem! Do you have result yet? This is weird. lt's totally different from the hand print in Shinto. So the victim was not lnugami Sukekiyo. Yes. He was replaced. What? By using the mask, the murderer switched between the real person and the faker. Who was the victim this morning? l think he might be Shizuma. Really? All right. l get it. So Sukekiyo is the criminal. Sukekiyo? Don't come to me. l killed them. Suketake, Suketomo and Shizuma. . . l killed all of them. Sukekiyo! l am wanted now. There is no way for me to run. l know l made a lot of mistakes. Just imagine l died during the war. Before l turn myself in, l just want to see you one last time. You should abandon the identity of lnugami. Forget about everything and live a new life. All right? You follow me here. l can understand your dander. But don't worry. l have decided to stay away from you guys. What are you doing? lt's too late to ask me to return now! Police! Hey! Sukekiyo! Sorry to ask you to come all the way here. Did Sukekiyo come to you just now? l am lnugami Sukekiyo, the serial killer of all the murder cases. l make the confession now. l think Sukekiyo must have broken up with you. That's right. Tamayo, you knew the body in the lake was not Sukekiyo. l might have mistaken others, but definitely not him. You threaten Shizuma to kill Suketake and Suketomo for you. You promised to give him a huge amount of money when you inherit the legacy. Was that right? Yes. And you killed Shizuma because you were arguing about the money? No. Did you plan to kill Shizuma right from the beginning? You had that in mind right from the beginning. Of course not. On the contrary, you were threaten by Shizuma. lsn't that right, Sukekiyo? You couldn't be the murderer of all the murder cases. The murder case of Wakabayashi happened on April 1 9, No. . . But you only arrived here on April 21 . l mean, l killed the three family members of lnugami. Chief, did you hear what he said? Unconsciously, he admitted he was the demobilized soldier appeared at Kashiwaya. Yes. When you were demobilized at Hakata, you knew from newspapers that there was a fake Sukekiyo in lnugami family. You switched your identity with that man. ln order to make everything easier, you covered your face when you went to kashiwaya. At 1 0pm that night, you sneaked into lnugami mansion and found the fake Sukekiyo. As you expected, the fake Sukekiyo was Aonuma Shizuma. Shizuma insisted to revenge. Both of you must have a big argument then. Both of you hid yourselves when Suketake appeared. Soon, Tamayo came too. lt was just like what Tamayo told us. And. . . after Tamaya and Saruzo left, Suketake was killed. Both of you witnessed the whole process. Sukekiyo, it means you saw the face of the murderer. You mean. . . This man is not the murderer? You wrote the confession letter to cover up for the murderer. You shouldn't keep the secret anymore. Besides, maybe telling the truth is a way of redemption for the murderer. This is Kindaichi. Please come in. Sorry for disturbing you. May l help you? Yes. You know the body found in the lake was not Sukekiyo, right? Yes. l was informed about it. The police have arrested Sukekiyo. Where is Sukekiyo? Sukekiyo has become the suspect of the serial murder cases of lnugamis. Ridiculous. There is no way Sukekiyo is a murderer. lndeed. Sukekiyo is not the murderer. The murderer is. . . you. Do you have any proof to say that? lt's you. . . who asked Wakabayashi to read the will. Me? Although you bought off Wakabayashi, he got afraid after reading the content. That's why he asked me for help. Shut up! Who do you think you are? Admit it, you asked Wakabayashi. . . How dare you enter someone's house as you like? You are not even a police. First, when Wakabayashi was killed, l went to the harbour of Hakata. Yeah. That's why l was confused. A criminal could commit a crime without getting near to the victim. l went to visit your mother at lwaki Village yesterday. l got to know your address from Mr. Furudate. Because l'd like to know more details about lnugami Sahei. Your mother kept asking money from you. She saw it at the station by accident. . . that you passed cigarettes to Wakabayashi. That was the day you went off to Hakata. She is not my mother. No one would believe a word she says. After you killed Wakabayashi, you killed Suketake too. Do you know on that night, Sukekiyo was hiding underneath the observatory? Sukekiyo? He and Shizuma. You were watching Suketake. . . You approached him once Tamayo and Saruzo left. Sukekiyo. . . After you left, Shizuma threatened Sukekiyo to do everything he says if he doesn't want others to know his mother was a murderer. From that day onwards, Sukekiyo became the accomplice to Shizuma. This could help your mother. The crueller it is the better. No one would have doubted a woman did this. On the second day, when you saw Suketake's head on the doll, you must be shocked, huh? The murder has no idea who the accomplices are. . . is one of the characters in this case. You, Takeko and Umeko are fighting over the legacy by all means. ln order to let your son Sukekiyo gets married with Tamayo, and occupy the legacy, you decided to kill. But do you know that. . . Tamayo is actually the granddaughter of Mr. Sahei? Noriko, the mother of Tamayo, was the child of Haruyo Nomomiya and Sahei. That's what l think. You have accomplished something Sahei had always wanted to do. Let me. . . Please let me see Sukekiyo! Let me. . . Please let me see Sukekiyo! Mother. . . Thank God you are all right. . . When l heard your troop collapsed in Burma, l didn't want to live anymore. But l must not let you die alone. That's the belief that has been supporting me. God must have heard my prayers. l . . . l didn't see you for 5 years. l could never forget the day l saw you off to Nagano. Sukekiyo, why didn't you come back earlier since you are alive? lt was my neglect that caused the collapse of my troop. l have no face to return to Japan. l missed you so much until l made a huge mistake. l had mistaken Shizuma as you. Forgive me. . . That was an accident. An accidental accident. A few accidents happened together. Everyone, everything happened here was accumulated by the accidents. But you need outstanding wisdom to put all these accidents together. Aonumo Shizuma got this wisdom through the training in army. lt must be useful on the battlefield. When he was asked for hand print, Shizuma thought he has to let the cat out of the bag this time. So he switched identities with Sukekiyo on the next day. Sukekiyo wore the mask and stayed at home. Shizuma became the demobilized soldier to throw the headless body into the lake. Then he abandoned the boat at Kannon Cape and stayed at Kashiwaya for a night. When we did the matching of hand prints on the next day, it was the real Sukekiyo who made the hand print, of course they matched. On that night, Sukekiyo and Shizuma switched back again. Sukekiyo did what Shizuma said, he changed the clothes and ran away before he was fainted. He threw the mask away on purpose to prove that they didn't switch. Before that day, l was suspecting in my mind if the young man next to me was really my son. When l got to know that the hand prints matched, l was so glad. And l blamed myself for suspecting my son. On that night, l invited my harp teacher to come over. lf anything happen, l . . . l had no idea what l was doing. No. There is another person controlling me to do this. Ouch! My Suketomo. . . how could you! Takeko, calm down! Suketomo who fought with Sukekiyo in the empty house returned in exhaustion. Did Sukekiyo and Shizuma put his body on the rooftop? That's right. Sukekiyo, the string on Suketomo's neck. . . Shizuma said he wanted to make use of the curse of three heirlooms. Put the head of first victim on the Kiku(mum) doll, then killed with harp. But, Kindaichi, according to the testimony of Ms. Matsuko, she was playing harp during that time. l went to meet the harp teacher. Someone who has played harp for 4 or 5 years could differentiate if the sound of harp is turbid. When she asked me to hear her playing, l felt weird. At first she was playing pretty well at first, but after she left for a while and came back, l could hear that her pointing finger was wounded. And l found out she bore the pain and continued to play trying to hide it from me. l made a decision then. l would return to lnugami family as Sukekiyo. Everything in this family belongs to me. Tamayo, the legacy. . . Everything belongs to me! l defeated the lnugamis! Shizuma! Did you throw Shizuma's body into the lake? Takeko, Umeko, please forgive me. l have no way to run now. Although he was our father, he never loved us one day. He hated us. But in the end, we still couldn't get away from the grudge of father. Mr. Kindaichi, on the night of Suketake's wake, who went into Tamayo's room? Of course it's Shizuma. Why? l think he noticed the plan of Tamayo. He tried to take the pocket watch with his fingerprints on it. Tamayo had no idea Sukekiyo was back. We didn't find the pocket watch on Suketake's body. This is. . . l don't know about fingerprints. When it fell out from his chest, l just. . . Chief. Yes? Does Sukekiyo have to go to jail too? l think so. He was still an accomplice although he had difficulties and reason. Would it be a serious sentence? Well. . . Would he be sentenced to death? l don't think so. There is space for deliberation. Tamayo. Yes. You will wait for Sukekiyo to be released from the jail, right? l will wait for him. Really? That's great. The person who cut a hole on Tamayo's boat was you who read the will, right? Sukekiyo, don't let Tamayo miss her father anymore. Oh no! Oh no! Mother Mother! l am Sukekiyo, mother! lt's the tobacco, chief! lt's the same as the tobacco that killed Wakabayashi. Mother! Mother. . . This is monetary gift, 3500 yen and the transportation fare, 467 yen. Thank you. Let me double confirm. Thanks. Thank you for your great help, Kindaichi. The amount is correct. l'll give you a receipt. No, it's okay. l must give you. l need to borrow your pen. Go ahead. This was really a mysterious case. There's no way to find out the truth if there was only the general police investigation. lf l could find out the clues earlier, there won't be so many victims involved. l'm truly sorry. Please forgive me. The chief, Tamayo and the waitress of the hotel want to have a farewell party for you. My wife is preparing it now. l am not used to farewell. That's troublesome. . . Don't worry about it. Just a little of our courtesy. Hey. . . ls it ready yet? Thank you for everything. Here, it's here. . . Hey! Are we too early or what? We gather at the police station. Well. . . Saruzo, you have come too. l can't forget Kindaichi. l bring him some local products. What is it? ls Kindaichi not here yet? Well. . . That man just came out of nowhere.
