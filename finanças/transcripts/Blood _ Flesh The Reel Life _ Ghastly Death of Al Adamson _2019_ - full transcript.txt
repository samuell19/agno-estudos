(mellow melodic music) (cicadas chirping) (light melodic music) - 20 years ago, this was a ranch, there was a trailer for the caretaker and the maid, but for some reason, nothing's been rebuilt where the murder occurred. - [Presenter] It was a real life horror, it's a chilling story proving life can be stranger than fiction. - [Jack] His business associate and his family always heard from him at least two or three times a week. For five weeks, they had not heard from him and the last place that he was seen was at his residence. - This story reads like the plot of a bad horror movie, except this is real and the victim, believe it or not was a horror film director. - [Presenter] You're looking at the last interview film director, Al Adamson ever gave. During the '60s, Adamson gained a cult following of fans, who enjoyed his low budget horror films. (screaming) - [Newsreader] And now police are looking for a motive as they try to unravel a real life horror story. - Al really didn't deserve that ending. - I was like shocked. Such an odd death. - Horror movie director ends up in a horror movie scenario and I just couldn't believe it. - It just didn't even seem real, I mean, how could someone murder Al? - He was a good person, you know, he didn't do nothing to nobody. (light melodic music) - [Sean] Al Adamson, like who was this guy? - My claim to fame as a director and also our company, Independent International Pictures, I think we put more on the screen for the amount of money spent than anybody else did. (dynamic melodic music) - What other director worked with Colonel Sanders, - How do you do? - [Michael] Charles Manson, bikers and porn people? (thudding blow) - Uh! - [Gary] You could be sure there were gonna be midgets, (screaming) a lot of breasts, blood and gore. - Who's that? - All kinds of fun people and strange things going on. - He was the king of B movies. - He'd do things on a nickel that majors would do for $20,000. - He exploited any and everything he could. - For the amount of money that he had to make the films, I've never seen anybody make films better than Al Adamson. - Anybody that says that, oh, some of Al Adamson's movies were good, no, they were not. - You're right, I am a rotten bastard, I admit it. I wrote down six of the movies that I thought were pretty interesting, that Al made, "Blood of Dracula's Castle," "Hell's Bloody Devils," "Horror of the Blood Monsters," "Five Bloody Graves," "Brain of Blood," "Blood of Ghastly Horror," but I mean, how are you gonna take a guy like that seriously? - [Woman] You don't even know him. - He was an original and he wasn't always the good guy. - I didn't kill him, I could've a few times. - [Man] But Al certainly carved a niche for himself in Hollywood history. (melodic upbeat music) - [Announcer] The shocking scenes you're about to see are not suggested for the weak or immature. - Let's see, where'd he go? Ah, get me outta here, let me outta here, let me out. Did you hear that? Did you hear what was in that box? Ah, let me outta here, I can't stand this. I'm in here, I can't breathe, let me outta here. (sinister laughing) This is the head of the Frankenstein monster from "Dracula vs. Frankenstein." (ominous suspenseful music) All kinds of things here, it's amazing, you'd be amazed at what's here, I would be amazed at what's here. I went to my first movie at the age of four and that was called "Knickerbocker Holiday," but I quickly became a fan of horror and westerns, starting collecting films at the age of eight, started in 1948, still collecting, eventually decided I would make my own films and I attended the City College of New York Film Institute. In school I worked as a film editor. Over here's my old Moviola from IP, many films cut on that including "Brain of Blood." (metallic clattering) Oh dear, there they all go. Joe Franklin used to have an office like this, things all around it and he'd say when something fell over, "Leave it, it's fine, leave it where it falls, "leave it where it falls." Joe was the first person I met and befriended in the entertainment industry, he helped me to do everything. (mellow melodic music) - Well, in this world, Mr. Salle, you've got your Alfred Hitchcock, you've got your Roger Corman, but there are fanatical, avid, ardent fans of Al Adamson, whose 32 movies play on TV all over the world every night and they include "The Murder Gang" and "Dracula vs Frankenstein." You know, in the old days one lone cameraman with a shoestring budget could make a movie, but since "Jurassic Park" and "Star Wars," I think the public is spoiled today, you've got to give them multi million dollar, lavish effects, right, it's not like the old days anymore or am I wrong, I don't know? - It's tougher today. - Tougher? - Yeah. - You know, this man's father was a pioneer film cowboy, right, Al? His name was-- - Denver Dixon. - [Joe] Denver Dixon, he was like Art Acord, Jack Hoxie. - He was on your show. - That's right. - I got started in the business, because my father was init, I grew up in it, as long as I can remember back, that's the only thing I wanted to do was be around films. I guess I was more of a fantasy world, I didn't think I ever would be, but I ended up being in ‘em, it just kind of happened. - Al was like the brother I never had, he was just a great guy and we had a lot of fun together. We're partners, friends and compadres, I consider him my best friend and he said that he considers me his. Al was born in 1929 in California to a father, Denver Dixon aka Victor Adamson and his mother Dee Dixon, she was a non-professional, but Denver Dixon trained her to be an actress. Al might have been conceived during the making of this film in Oregon. - Denver Dixon had been a cowboy in New Zealand and he specialized in rope tricks. - My Dad could rope, ride a horse and drive wagons, he also could use a bullwhip and get a cigarette out of my mother's mouth. (whip cracking) - Denver Dixon was the original independent, he was a working cowboy from Australia, he made the first western on Australia in 1910, came to the the United States, worked on the East Coast, went to the West Coast, did westerns, he was offered a big job with Universal, turned it down. - He went out and made his own films, distributed his own films, by doing that he took all the control and he was able to make a good living making films. - A friend of mine, a distributor in New York was handling Denver's pictures and his son wanted to get in the business. - My father kept pushing him, you know, because he knew all the tricks. - I really wanted to be a dancer, I really wanted to be in the musicals, I wanted to sing and dance, all those things, unfortunately I didn't have any rhythm, so I became an actor. Hey, break it up, you two, we're moving out. - [Samuel] "Half Way to Hell" was backed by Denver, was directed by Denver, the part of the Mexican bandit was played by Lyle Felice. - Here. - Something happened with Lyle Felice during the making of the picture and he walked off the film. Taking a cue from that, Denver walked off the picture, he had some dispute with Al. - He's not gonna take advice from his father, Heaven forfend. - Al finished the picture. - I found out I was better telling people what to do, than being told what to do. Right. So I ended up being a director. - That's the first time he directed anything, but the picture was not particularly good and it was a failure. - It was a mess. - Sometimes they work and sometimes they don't. In 1958, met James Warren, publisher of Famous Monsters of Filmland magazine and I worked closely with him, it was Forrie Ackerman for a number of years and I learned advertising and campaigns through Jim Warren and I eventually became an editor on Screen Thrills lllustrated, Wildest Westerns and Spacemen. - Sam was like a fanboy, he knew about a lot of obscure people and was a big fan of western stars, so he knew who Al's Dad was. - [Samuel] And in 1962, through the help of my parents, I took my first trip to Los Angeles. - He went out for a month and one of the people he wanted to interview was Denver Dixon and that's when he met Al. - Click, the door opens, there's Al, that's the first time I met him. Denver tells him, "It's Mr. Sherman, "he's in from New York, "he's interviewing me for a magazine article." I became a fast friend of Denver Dixon's, he asked me if I would represent "Half Way to Hell." I went back to New York, met Irwin Pizor, President of Hemisphere Pictures and his partner, Kane Lynn and I ended up doing campaigns for them and after the failure of "Half Way to Hell," what was Al doing? He was running a nightclub in the San Fernando Valley, what made him come back was he was managing the singer, Tacey Robbins. ♪ Even the boy from New York City ♪ ♪ Found it hard to leave my LA ♪ - [Samuel] They felt if she was in a movie, she would mean more. - A movie that at first was called "Echo of Terror" and then it became a number of different things. - [Samuel] So he's done this film, Denver said "You can't trust anybody here in LA, "you've got to go to see Sam Sherman in New York." We took that 35 millimeter print to preview theater and ran it, just he and myself, I said Al, you've really got talent as a director, this is a great movie, dramatic, good action. - [Man] Hold it! - So I then set up a screening of all the independent distributors I knew in New York including Hemisphere and everybody turned it down, they said it's a really good film, but there's nothing to exploit. - Bye bye. - Bye. - See you later, huh? - [Samuel] At that point, go-go dancing was really popular, so Kane Lynn, who was at Hemisphere said, "Why don't we try to get go-go in the title?" Al went back and shot these go-go scenes. - [Announcer] A desire in flame to madness and murder by the wild, provocative young bodies of the go-go girls. Some live only for kicks and they take their love where they find it, but sometimes it's the wrong kind, a psycho, who gets his kicks a different way. See "Psycho A Go-Go." - We couldn't give away "Psycho A Go-Go." - They started thinking, well, maybe we could make this more marketable. - They went back a third time, made it more of a horror movie, added a few name stars. - What's this all about? - Bringing John Carradine in, giving us a name. - Have I overlooked some parking tickets? - Having him put the brain in this killer's head, that supposedly caused all the other scenes of him being a maniacal killer. - Who asked you to put this thing in my brain? - No one, I decided it was best. - Oh, you decided? - Al said, "If the picture doesn't work, "you'll figure out what we do to change it." - [Erik] Okay, it's a crime film, but we've got to have one of the bank robbers be the zombie. - [Samuel] We re-shot till there was only 10 minutes of "Psycho A Go-Go" left. - I can't believe it. - It's true. - It was the biggest mish mash ever seen on this planet and now that was called "Blood of Ghastly Horror." - [Announcer] Human zombies, (screaming) living corpses in "Blood of Ghastly Horror." - So we took it to Hemisphere, who distributed it for a while as that version, it did nothing, so Al was depressed. (mellow guitar music) - Well welcome to the Cochise RV resort. It's not Hollywood, but a few of us old Hollywood guys still hanging around here above the grass, my name is Bob Dix, I was an actor for many, many years. My friend, Al Adamson takes a really near and dear place in my heart, we did it all together at one time or another. I had written an original screenplay about a gunfighter named Ben Thompson, I submitted the script to Lucky Brown and he handed it off to Al. - I knew everybody there, they knew me well, the studio in Hollywood was just down the street from Consolidated Film Industries, which was convenient, I'm two blocks away from sending it to the lab. - We all met at Hollywood Stage, Hollywood Stage was on Santa Monica Boulevard at the Stuart and the only way to get a job for someone who had no idea about the movies was to hang out where movies were made. - I would lie and try and get the job, I'm a production manager, I'm a stuntman, I can do lighting. - And Al came by the office and he says, "You guys are doing pretty good then, "because we shoot one in three days." And I was supposed to direct "Five Bloody Graves," but Al wanted to do it, so he put up another 15,000 or whatever it might be, I said hey, let him do it. - He agreed to match me dollar for dollar and we would co-produce, so we created Dix International Pictures and it consisted of Al, myself, our attorney and Bud Cardos. (light guitar music) - I had a pretty good reputation back in those days and these independents coming in and taking over the show, got in trouble and stuff like that. Ludi, come on! I went in and met Al, I really liked him right off the top, he was a really nice guy and everything. - Bud Cardos started out with me as a production manager/stuntman doing both, he would jump in when we needed stunts done, he would choreograph the stunts, he was able to do things on the set and to help me with things, we were a great team, he was the best production manager I've ever had. - [Announcer] "Five Bloody Graves." - Al cast Vicki Volante, it was the beginning of a really heavy love affair in Al's mind. - Vicki said she was being called back for a film, but that the director was hitting on her and she was not interested in him, so would I come down and act as her boyfriend and she would introduce me and when I encountered Al Adamson, I didn't have a career, so I said to him can I help you on the show? He said, "Well, no, I don't have money," I said oh, you don't have to pay me. Al always loved getting somebody to work for free, I didn't know it at the time, but it kind of was his modus operandi. - We got decent names for the film, Scott Brady, Jim Davis, Carradine, the old man. - John Carradine, one of the nicest men I've ever met, he did have a drinking problem, when I first found him, nobody was hiring him. - Animals, animals. - One time Al came to him and he was stretched out on a couch in the back of the stage there and Al had about two pages of dialogue that changed. - You know, he read it, went back to bed. - "Okay, Mr. Carradine, on the set, please," and he went, "Huh?" - Face your sins, then ask forgiveness from the Almighty, then and only then can you find true happiness. - Never blew a line. - The man had a photographic mind. - And when the director said, "Cut," he went, "Uh!" - So we were in Fluter, Utah, we got one motel, we got all the rooms, we got all the equipment, we got all the actors, we got the horses and Al is supposedly gonna direct. - Vicki and I had a intimate scene, where she is giving me a cup of coffee and I noticed Al's coverage, he wanted to shoot the whole scene with everybody behind the camera and everything on Vicki. - Are you asleep? - [Ben] Yep. - Cutting it is a different story, than just shooting, you've got to cover whatever you're doing and I saw that he was just not doing his job the way he should do it. - When you do work like we were doing in the independent field, you know, all of us wear more than one hat, if you're not working in front of the camera, you're either playing assistant director or crowd control, one time I was sweeping up the horse apples and one of the people came and asked, "What do you do?" I said I'm a producer. - I played two roles in that, Santago, the Indian chief here. - [Announcer] Yaqui Chief Santago slaughters the white man and woman in the name of justice for his people. - And I played Firewater Joe, he was a half-breed. You're gonna find out that death by ants is very slow. - Everybody worked together to put this on the screen in the best way we can, but after we shot the movie, we had to do our narrative track to cover some of the coverage he didn't get to, ‘cause he was so involved with Vicki Volante. - [Announcer] These two men, each of whom is certain of the justice and honor for which he does battle meet in a final confrontation. - I tried to train him, how to direct, how to act, how to edit, he wasn't good at any of 'em. - [Announcer] Diabolical. (ominous suspenseful music) - Before long Al wanted to make a film based on a script by Rex Carlton, who had been around the business since the '50s, "Feast of Vampires," I said Al, this is awful, it's really terrible, "Well, what would you do with it?" So I ended up rewriting it and changing it into "Blood of Dracula's Castle." - Hey. - There it is! - For "Blood of Dracula's Castle," I had to find a castle and that wasn't easy, but I found one up in Lancaster, we rented the whole castle, we used it, it was a wonderful location, we really got some great mileage out of it. - John Carradine was in it and people were just like, well, John Carradine can't be in every picture, I'd say why not? Paula Raymond was in it. - [Lucky] Alex D'Arcy, Bob Dix was in it as the crazy eye. - I played Crazy Johnny and Vicki Volante. (screaming) - That Al had a stock company is undeniable and so did Ed Wood, so did Ted V Mikels, I mean, so did Ray Steckler, anybody who I think works consistently, you know, you go back to the people that you have a comfort level with, the people who get it. - I did all the UPM work, lined up the schedules, doubled John Carradine when he had the fall down the steps, at the same time I went out and found bats, live bats, that we had to put in the cellar and we shot in like five days, but we shot most of Al's pictures in a week to 10 days, depending on the picture. - [Announcer] A picture that will delight anyone, who finds a certain satisfaction in horror and lunacy. - Al came to New York with it and I had Columbia Screen Gems ready to buy it for television for more than the cost of the picture. -We had a TV deal on "Blood of Dracula's Castle," which would have paid off the lab and made things right. - The film got sold out from under Al and Sam. - It must be some sort of a joke. - Something went wrong with Rex Carlton, I'm not sure that anybody really knows, there's a lot of rumors about what happened to Rex Carlton. - I guess he promised somebody the wrong thing or he took the wrong money. - He had a gambling problem, a real bad gambling problem. - We found out that the film had been sold in an auction to the man that originally put up the money, so he got the film without having to pay off the money that he owed. - Everybody else was wiped out. Rex had taken money from some tough characters and they were going to take it out of his hide. He left New York, went back to Los Angeles, he lived on the Sunset Strip, sat down in his bathtub, put a gun to his head and blew his brains out. - Really? I didn't think he was the suicide type, but that's what they put on his death certificate, suicide. I just wondered if he owed so much money to the wrong people, hm. - This is a perfect setting for a murder. - Yes, isn't it? - That was Al and my introduction to what could happen in the entertainment business. - It was very exasperating at that time, because I was in the beginning of my career and to know that people like this exist. - Adamson was either really smart or really lucky finding amazing cinematographers, some of the early movies were shot by Laszlo Kovaks and Vilmos Zsigmond. - Vilmos and Laszlo fled Hungary during the Revolution, came here to America, they couldn't speak English that well and just like everybody else when you started in Hollywood, this is where you started was the B movies. - So Laszlo went on to shoot "Easy Rider" and work with Bogdanovich and people like that. Vilmos Zsigmond later got the Academy Award for "Close Encounters" and he did three films for Al. - Vilmos Zsigmond, Willy! Yeah, it's funny, when he first came here, he was Willy, he wanted everybody to think he was American, because he could get more jobs that way. When he got to be famous, then he became Vilmos again. - He came to me and said, "I started to make a movie and I shot two weeks, "nothing is in focus, what do you suggest?" I said well, I'll tell you what I would do, I would junk this, like forget it, hire me and I have all the equipment that you need to shoot this movie and I'll work for $100 a day. - Every time I put together $100, we'd go out and shoot some more on "Psycho A Go-Go," that was the first film that I used him on. - So he hires me the first weekend and on five o'clock he comes to me and says, "There's a couple more shots left, "l have to go do something, "would you direct these couple of scenes "and I will come back with your money?" - An hour later he came back with a bunch of singles and change. - I said when did you get this money? He said, "Well, in my free time, "I'm delivering newspapers." - He went to his customers, who had not I guess paid him for the subscription to the newspaper, got the money and paid Vilmos. - After this I respected this guy. - But then he became a prick, he had all these people that he hadn't paid, because it was experience for them. - It was always really about Al, Al didn't know that I was selling crap to make a living, Al never thought, how is this guy living? I don't pay him anything. - He always had money for himself, but never paid me. - SO we were having a couple of drinks and I said Adamson, in 15 minutes, if you don't have the money, we'll beat the shit out of you, in summary we were half loaded. He come over from 1500, that's when I think it was 1500 and Bob and I said Jesus Christ, we got lucky. - He cheated me all the time. - [Michael] Later on his most used cinematographer was Gary Graver and a very talented guy. - My father's career started off in the late '50s, early '60s, when he moved from Portland to Los Angeles, he wanted to be an actor, actually his real deep desire was he wanted to make movies like Orson Welles made. - I was in the Navy in the Combat Camera Unit and I got started literally with Al, I went on as an assistant cameraman on a picture called "The Fakers." Everyone was doing James Bond movies, you know, so this was a kind of a James Bond movie. ♪ When you play the game, you always deal ♪ ♪ And never show anyone how you feel ♪ ♪ Act the part, make it look like it's real ♪ ♪ Fakers ♪ - It's a good film, fact is we had Nelson Riddle do the title song. ♪ And never tell the truth when you can lie ♪ ♪ In the scheme of chance, to lose is to die ♪ - Which was quite a coup for a little low budget picture like that. - He cast Broderick Crawford, former Academy Award winner as a head of a detective squad that was investigating counterfeit plates that were stolen from the Nazis. - Von Delberg's gonna pass around a few million quality counterfeit, he's gonna refinance the Nazi party in Germany. - I used Broderick Crawford for one day and he's in the whole film, I shot him out in one day. - One thing that Sam Sherman always wanted in his movies was old names from the past. - He would get guys who were really almost out of the business, people like Kent Taylor, who goes back to the '30s. - We used to laugh about it, you know, who's he going to get and he always surprised us and he never disappointed and these guys were on the way out, Carradine was really crippled with arthritis, Taylor was pretty much out of film, none of them were insulted by it or belittled by it, they were pampered and treated like the stars they were. - Alot of people, they didn't wanna retire, they didn't choose to retire, the business retires you and the phone stops ringing. - Hollywood chews 'em up and spits 'em out and on the way out, Al grabbed 'em and made one more run with 'em. - Ah, get lost. - When we would be on location, it was always KFC. - Every meal we had, lunch and dinner was Colonel Sanders. - Free Kentucky Fried Chicken, because we agreed to put Colonel Sanders in the movie. - How do you do? How do, ma'am? - So I said we want you to come out and you say, ain't that chicken finger-lickin' good? He said, "Listen, we first started "doing television commercials." - We got hundreds and hundreds of phone calls saying get that dirty old man off the television talking about licking his fingers, so he said, "I ain't gonna do it." - Isn't that the most wonderful chicken you ever ate? - He refused to say his line and they had to do several takes of it, which is a big no no on an Al Adamson film. I don't think I've eaten Colonel Sanders since then. - He finally revolted and said, "Look Al, you've got to do something," so he made a deal with Pioneer Chicken. - They decided to do re-shoots and Al asked me if I'd like to shoot, there had been two other cameramen on the picture, but he trusted me, at the same time I started out with Al, I'd also met Orson Welles, so I was working a lot with Orson Welles and with Al. - And the lessons that he learned from working with Al Adamson carried over and helped to make many of those Orson Welles film projects possible. - Talk about an interesting career, to work with Al Adamson and Orson Welles and shoot second unit on "Raiders of the Lost Ark," how many cameramen can say that? - You know, there wasn't much money, but there was always a good, positive attitude with Al on the sets. - And when they were filming some of the biker scenes, the police suddenly showed up and that footage is in the movie. - Gary Graver was a gorilla style DP and he was fast, you could run in somewhere where you weren't supposed to be and shoot a scene and get out, he wasn't gonna put his foot down and say oh, I can't work under these conditions, that's why he was so popular with Al Adamson. - "The Fakers" was a Television Movie of the Week and you could sell anything to television in those days, when we started the picture, but when we finished it, the whole market went down. Motorcycle pictures were happening at that time. changed over it with "Easy Rider," so we got some of the footage out, that we were using originally and we made the motorcycle gang part Nazis, because there was a big Nazi element in the original picture. - It was an action picture, we put the motorcycle element in and we converted "The Fakers" into "Hell's Bloody Devils." - [Announcer] They're rougher, tougher and meaner than all the others as they zoom their motorcycles towards the most violent and sadistic acts, "Hell's Bloody Devils" ride hard, live hard and love hard. - Sam and I are good picture fixers, (laughing) we've taken a lot of bad pictures and shot additional footage to 'em and made 'em work. - Do you think there may be animal life out there? - It's possible. - Sam Sherman would have Al Adamson shoot more footage for these foreign films, that hadn't played in America at all or maybe not much. Sometimes it would just be a few scenes, sometimes it would be like 20 to 40 minutes of brand new footage. - You're right, doctor, there is an intelligent form of life. - And you'd go to see this movie and you'd think something's not right about this movie, it doesn't really fit together right, well, that's ‘cause it was made in different decades and different countries. - We had a film called "Creatures of the Red Planet," it was a Philippine movie, black and white, that Al was re-shooting as a space flight to this planet, where these prehistoric things were going on and this prehistoric footage, black and white was gonna be tinted red, but it gave you tremendous headaches and eyestrain, so I said let me follow what a silent movie would've done, daytime, amber, water scenes, green, (shrieking) nighttime, blue and when the vampires came, (roaring) that's when I used the red tint. (eerie orchestral music) - They called it Spectrum-X, that was just to disguise the fact that you were bringing a black and white and a color film together. - So I said Al, we've got to add more footage to explain why the colors were changing. - About whom the Spectrum gun will show you what is happening with the chromatic radiation belt. Choose a color. - Green. (electronic beeping) - How about red? (electronic beeping) And blue. (electronic beeping) Right now I'd like some relaxation in any color. I hadn't seen a script and still we're able to play the scene and was cut in their own movie, I never saw him till years later. - They had an opening sequence where these vampires were attacking people in the alleyway. - As the vampire approached, I did what any brave young boy would do, I let go of my mother's hand and ran down the street and left her to be attacked and devoured by the vampire. - [Fred] They do this pan across all the vampires and it's Al and it's Gary Graver, I don't know who was running the camera and so when they could do the trailer, they were able to say all color. - [Announcer] In weird color! - And they kept showing you the shots from that opening three-minute sequence that they had shot in color. - Well, this thing eventually was all cut together, it looked good, I had to make a better title and I wrote down horror, blood and monsters. - "Horror of the Blood Monsters" and you like horror pictures, what a great title. - You didn't need to see the ad, the title was the ad. - What does it have to do with the movie? Not a damn thing, who cares? Claw men and John Carradine in this jackass spaceship, you want more than that? - [Announcer] You'll see human beings hideously transformed into the most grotesque creations we ever dared to show you on screen. - He then had a screening with me at Movielab, but he said, "This is awful, just shelve it." (dramatic melodic music) - A guy came in the office, who said that he could put together a Italian western, if Al could come up with an American star. We got Robert Taylor and everything fell in place, the financing from the United States, the financing from Europe, off he goes to Spain, this would have been a big picture for Al. - The people in Spain rejected the cast we had, so the whole thing fell apart. - And he spent his last buck flying back and forth talking to these people. - Al had invested every penny he had, $50,000 is a lot of money, all his money went down the drain. - So I came back to New York and I was broke, I was really broke, didn't have a dime. - Very depressed as you can imagine. - I'd met Dan Kennis through Sam Sherman, we talked about making films together and he said, "Well, if you can write a story that we like, "we'll give you the money "to go back to California to make this film." So I went back to a sleazy, $10 a night hotel room, stayed up all night, wrote the whole story. - He called me the next morning, seven o'clock, "Come down here immediately, "I've got the answer to our problems." - A motorcycle gang has to chase a young girl and a young guy all compressed in a day or two time wise and Danny said, "I like it, I'm gonna back it." - They gave me the money to go home to start pre-production on the film. - He didn't have a script and I said, well, I'll write it for you, I used the magic word, I said I'll do it for free. Al's favorite movies were not motorcycle movies or horror movies, Al's favorite movies were musicals, he loved "Seven Brides For Seven Brothers," he loved "West Side Story" with Russ Tamblyn. - I actually abandoned the movie industry and the entertainment industry. (mellow melodic music) Only an artist would do this, I threw my Academy Award nomination plaque up on the wall and forgot about it and a couple of years later, I went up to fix the aerial and I saw it up there, it was all peeling, so I brought it back down to my studio, painted a little bit on it, stuck a dice on it, I thought hey, it looks pretty cool now. I got rid of my agent, my manager and put all of my concentration and focus on art. Unfortunately I ran out of money and needed to work, Al Adamson sent me the script and I remember reading it and thinking, oh God, how am I gonna do this? - Russ Tamblyn was at pretty much semi-retired, when I first met him, I don't know whether it was his choice or the film industry's choice, because he had a tendency to wanna do things his way. - I told him and I said, well, you know, I'm in this really creative stage right now and so I need to kind of have my own way with it and he said, "That's great, whatever you wanna do." So that sort of turned me on and then the second thing was the money, I needed the money. - His own mother didn't want him to play that part, thought it would ruin his career. - And then the third thing and probably one of the most important things was that I had been a huge fan of Marlon Brando's movie, "The Wild One," so I said yes, yes and did it. - We go down to Indio two weeks and I had written a script and I used my father's middle name and my middle name, Dennis Wayne. - The script was pretty bad and I thought, well, I'll just say what I wanna say most of the time. - If you could just see your face. - I gave him the opportunity in "Satan's Sadists" to do a lot, I let him improvise. - And there's a lot of one liners. - You know what, what if they don't come. Plus the speech on top of the car that I completely wrote, what was originally written there was really crap. - You're right, I am a rotten bastard, I admit it, but I tell you something, even though I got a lot of hate inside, I got some friends who ain't got hate inside, they're filled with nothing but love, their only crime is growing their hair long, smoking a little grass and getting high, looking at the stars at night. Quentin Tarantino, he said, "You know, I'm such a fan of yours from "Satan's Sadists."" I said okay, come on, you're putting me on, right? And he said, "No," and he started quoting my speech, he quoted it like line for line and he just thought it was brilliant. I told him, I said I wrote that, you know. - Let's just cool it for a minute. - Let's all get stoned. - When I wrote it, I was hoping that I would be the good guy, but Al said to me, "You don't have enough experience, so I hired Gary Kent." - Those rocks will give us some protection, they won't be able to get their bikes up there. - Here is "Satan's Sadists" and I think this is from either Russia or Czechoslovakia. Al was very loyal and that was one of the great things about him, if he got a crew of people together, then when he did a film, he usually hired the same people, you'd show up to work and there'd be all your old friends. - And I wrote a part about a guy who was stoned all the time, I thought that would be a good character to play, so I played the part of Acid. - I was a half crazy motorcycle guy, who got killed by a rattlesnake. I've got this snake wrapped around my neck and I'm dying, you know. (laughing) - I had like a third or fourth lead in the picture at that time, I played Firewater. - You just slay this bastard. ♪ Come on and work it out now ♪ - Al needed a Mama for the motorcycle gang and just down the street from his office was a little coffee shop. - Barney's. - Well, Al went in and there was this pretty, blonde girl, Regina Carrol was waiting on tables, she spilled coffee on him. - Al always thought she did it on purpose, so she could get in the movies. - I read her for the part. - I don't care what happens to me anymore, but I'd die if something happened to you. - And she got it and the rest as they say is history. - That was when Al got his attention off of Vicki and on to Regina. - [Samuel] He'd not been successful with women prior to her. - She was sweet, she was kind, Regina was a dreamer. - She walked down the street, wolf whistles all over the place, everybody looked at Gina. - Gina and Al were together all the time. - Oh, he was crazy about her, he really was. - It was love at first sight, when she spilled that coffee on him, this was the man for her, they were just beautiful together and eventually they got married. - I guess you think that's kind of crazy, huh? - This former Vegas showgirl became his muse and she was in all of his films. ♪ Hey, work it on out now ♪ ♪ You got that motion ♪ ♪ Got an emotion ♪ - It was fun to make the movie, I liked working with all of the guys and I liked working with Al. - Well, the atmosphere on the set was always fun. (melodic upbeat music) - Every night we'd all go to Bud Cardos' room and Bud would have this big pate he made out of rattlesnake, we'd have beers and out would come the guitar and Bud would start singing, then Russ Tamblyn would show up and he would sing and then Bob Dix and pretty soon we'd all be crowded in this rotten, little, tiny motel room singing, drinking and eating rattlesnake. Bud Cardos always had his plane, because he would write it off to the production. - And every time we needed traveling shots, I would fly the cameraman and hang out, I used the plane to chase people with and I came down and bounced my wheels off a car, you know, ‘cause he liked all that shit, you know, it didn't cost him any money for the plane, if Al could get something for free, man, he'd get it and then I would just land on the highway. - Right on Interstate 10, Bud Cardos is landing his plane. Highway Patrol came out and they gave us a little bit of a static. - "Where's your permits for this?" and "We have to block the highways," and blah blah blah and here I am in my motorcycle outfit. Boy, I've had a lot of nothing. - Somehow he kept from going to jail. - "Satan's Sadists" is a little rougher than those earlier biker movies. - A lot of the handheld stuff really kind of puts you there and the violence is pretty jarring. - In the script all it says is they have a fight, then you've got to choreograph it. - I would watch, but he never staged the stunts, he'd say what he wanted, then Bud and I would work it out. Russ Tamblyn was also very handy, he'd been a dancer and an acrobat, so Russ could do all of his own work. - You know, I seriously got into it. - With that picture completed, we did a great campaign. - [Announcer] This is "West Side Story" star, Russ Tamblyn at his dramatic best in the shocking new motion picture, "Satan's Sadists," torn out of today's headlines, a shocking, realistic story of the wave of revolution and anarchy sweeping our country today, "Satan's Sadists." - I took that picture all around the country screening it and all the exhibitors took dates out of other things and booked it then. - [Announcer] And it's wild beyond belief. - The picture cost 50 grand to make. - It did like $20 million. - It made over $10 million on the world market. - The picture did probably six or $700,000. - The picture did a lot of money. - A ticket was a dollar and a half, so if you multiply that for the amount tickets cost today, six, seven, $8, the picture would have grossed $100 million. - I don't know if "Satan's Sadists" made as much money as they claim it did, I mean, a lot of these B movie people as we all know are well prone to hyperbole, shall we say. - Then Independent International Pictures, that had never existed all of a sudden became a company. - And I had four or five pictures that we hadn't been able to get distribution on yet. - "Five Bloody Graves" or "The Blood Monsters," "Blood of Ghastly Horror," "Hell's Bloody Devils," we took them out one by one like they were brand new, like they hadn't been sitting around for five or six years getting moldy. From the company that gave you "Satan's Sadists," "Hell's Bloody Devils," there's a new thing coming out. - [Announcer] You can't afford to miss "Hell's Bloody Devils," everybody's talking about it. - They made money and we made some more pictures, we put those out, one after the other after the other. - We have our own laws here. - [Announcer] They enforce them with their own savage justice. - In walks this guy, Raphael Nussbaum, who has some money, he wants to make a picture about a girl gang in a western setting. - [Announcer] "The Female Bunch." - We had about 10 of these girls, they forgot to find out if they could ride horses. - And they said, "Can you ride a horse?" And I said yes and that was my mistake. We were terrified every day. - When I got on location, the producer kept keeping the script from me and finally when he hands it to me, he hands me about three or four pages of what was basically a porno with a lot of girls in this sex ranch, I had Russ Tamblyn, I was trying to make a movie out of it. - "The Female Bunch," yeah, that was kind of fun. - We're gonna have to teach you a lesson, boy. - He was just the crazy man on the set, he would say, "Put the camera here, put the camera here," and like trying to co-direct. - Argh! - They ran out of money and I called my Daddy, I said they're gonna shut the film down, unless they have $3,000, he says, "Well, I'll give it to you, but this is a bad deal." I went no, it's not, Dad, no, no, no, it's not, well, of course it was a bad deal, I never saw it. My scene comes on where I get my heroin overdose from my lesbian lover, all of a sudden I'm nude, they did some pick up shots at the Manson ranch. - [Russ] We had shot several times out at the Spahn's Movie Ranch. - [Greydon] It was a popular setting to make movies, but around that time the Manson clan was there. - Charlie Manson, okay, how could I forget? He took a liking to me, that was one thing I'll never forget, Charlie would take me around, "Do you want a girl?" do you want a girl, I said no, no, no, no, no, it's fine. - These skeevy girls come walking up, they were pushy and obnoxious and tried to get us to go out to the desert with them. As it turned out, it was Linda Kasabian and Sadie Glutz. - Charles Manson came on the set, he was ogling the girls. - Go ride a horse. - And I told Bud, I says get him off my set and Cardos took him physically and moved him off the set. - I was a little cocky back in those days. - A week later it was big news that this Charles Manson group were all picked up in the desert and arrested for the horrors on the streets of LA. (ominous suspenseful music) (screaming) - Horror movies were really, really big worldwide, I think there was a record number of horror movies made in the early '70s. - So I wrote this script about a mad scientist, who lived in an amusement park and he would send his goon out to grab girls and they would do blood experiments on them. - "Blood Freaks," that was the title. - [Greydon] Al liked the script, Sam Sherman liked the script. - I said Al, you know, we have a dwarf in this picture, I'd like to have Angelo Rossitto, he was in several Lugosi pictures, he's terrific. "How do you get him?" I said, well, I heard he ran a newsstand on Hollywood Boulevard, Al walked up and down, he calls me back, he says, "You know, I can't find your man, "I'm gonna have to go with agent Jerry Rosen's dwarf." Who's Jerry Rosen's dwarf? Angelo Rossitto. - We wanna buy a ticket, we wanna buy a ticket. - It was not normal as a nine or 10-year old boy to be looking downward towards a 60-year old man, but he took it in his stride. (dramatic melodic music) - And then Al gets a great deal, two actors for the price of one, ♪ Carrol Naish as the mad scientist and Lon Chaney Jr. as his goon. - If it was Lon Chaney, I would say, well, why don't you make him be a werewolf, why don't you have him be something that the fans would really be into, but when you see the film, you understand the situation. - What I remember about Lon Chaney Jr. was he was quiet, very large, he seemed huge to me and he had a lot of health issues. - Lon Chaney Jr. was very ill. - We didn't know that at the time. - He developed cancer of the larynx. - They tried to give him dialogue, you couldn't understand what he was saying. - And Al says, "What the hell are we gonna do?" I said well, he doesn't have that many lines, yet he's supposed to be a mad goon, so he mumbles or scratchy voice, whatever it is. First day I knocked on the door, he opens the door and it's Lon Chaney Jr., wow, that's great, you know, Wolf Man. When we're ready to walk out there, he says, "Oh, I forgot my tea, I forgot my tea." So he goes back, he opens a bottle of vodka, pours it straight into a thermos with no tea, just the vodka, screws it up, says, "Okay, let's go." - I thought it would be interesting to work with Lon Chaney, that was my scene and I shot with him under the pier, but he was drunk the whole time, so we kind of had to stand him up to get through the scene, I actually kind of pitied him. - I always look at the other side of the coin, I was glad somebody was giving him a job and putting him on the screen. You know, I would watch anything with Lon Chaney. - So then J Carrol Naish comes in and he's being pushed in a wheelchair and we had no idea, Al turns to me, he says, "Oh, my God, what are we gonna do?" I said wait a minute, ♪ Carrol Naish is only in the amusement park. - Look here. (screaming) - And then he's down in his basement with the scientific bullshit, I said he doesn't have to walk, leave him in a wheelchair. We do a rehearsal, he couldn't remember a line, so I said well, why don't we write cue cards for him? - Alright. - And so I'd print them out really large and he had Coke bottle lenses, he couldn't read, he'd look off camera at his cue cards and he'd read his lines and then look back at the actor. - The circulatory system must experience a traumatic shock, one that is inconceivable to the human mind. - We didn't know he had one eye and one glass eye, so when you look at the movie, you see one eye going across reading the cue cards and the other eye just kind of hanging there. - She could walk away from us now as though nothing had happened on that fateful night. - The sound man kept hearing a clatter, da da da da, da da da da, da da da da da da. - We go what is that? No one could figure out what it was and it was J Carrol's teeth. - He had loose dentures that were clicking every time he talked. - She has survived decapitation, Is manufacturing the right type of vital fluid for us. - We told Al and Al said, "Screw it." - ♪ Carrol Naish says, "Oh, young man, "someday you're gonna work on a feature." I don't know what he thought he was making. (ominous suspenseful music) - Al sent the 16-day work print for Danny and his backers to see and they hated it, "We're shelving it." - We just had problems with story, some of the stuff we shot just didn't work, it was one of those pictures, it didn't work. - So I said Danny, listen, would you let me try to fix this? And he said, "Okay, see what you can do." So I start looking at this. - What in the world is a creature emporium? - A leftover from the sidewalk carnival days run by a Dr. Duray, at least that's the name he uses. - At least that's what he calls himself, maybe he could be something else. - They decided to change this whole concept of the script. - What is the answer? - How about if he's the last of the Frankensteins, the last Dr. Frankenstein. (electricity crackling) (dramatic melodic music) - At the time I was working a graveyard shift and shooting the movie at the same time and going through the makeup process, where Frankenstein was getting energized and all these things were zapping sparks, the original set stuff from "Frankenstein," you know, the electronics and all the ch, ch, ch, you know, they all went out and got all the original stuff. I kind of just went is this really happening to me? - And we put this thing together and I said, how about if we also throw in Count Dracula? We got him in there too. - I had nothing to do with that, I didn't write it, I wasn't working with Al, I didn't even know about it at the time. - Al was very specific, he said, "I wanna get our friend, Roger to play Dracula." - They picked their stockbroker to play him. - Dr. Duray, I presume. I hope your busy schedule will allow me a brief visit with you. - Sam and Al were sitting across from me and Al was different, he was like real pensive and I said what's going on? And he said, "You have acting background, don't you?" I said a little, yeah, he said, "You look the part, I mean Dracula." I said guys, come on and Sam's trying to discourage him, "What do you mean he's gonna do it? "He's raising money, we need him to raise money." "No, no, I have a feeling about this." - I'm known as the Count of Darkness, the Lord of the Manor of Carpathia. Turn here. - Forrie Ackerman and his wife, Wendy were having dinner with me, I said, how can we say Roger Engel as Dracula? He says, "We'll come up with a better name." - Szandor Vorkov, hm, so he said, "Do you know what that is?" And I said I don't. - [Samuel] Szandor LaVey, the satanist from San Francisco and Vorkov, kind of an acronym for Karloff. - [Roger] So I became Szandor Vorkowv. - [Samuel] Roger was quirky and odd and gave it a different spin. - I'm afraid your quest for knowledge must end tonight. - He's considered by many to be like the worst Dracula in cinema history. - They had a great idea to put a light under me to make me look more evil and I started blinking, I said guys, I'm blinking. Well, that is unimportant, doctor. "Don't worry about it, we'll take it out." So when I actually saw the finished product, there I am in one scene blinking, they hadn't taken it out. I don't know who wrote it, but the lines all ran together, there weren't any real breaks, so I'd have to really gulp words or gulp air. And get your revenge on Doctors Beaumont, Steadman and Marky, who ruined your career and caused the accidental fire, which crippled you as you are now. It felt very wooden sometimes and I would mention this to Al, "Don't worry, we'll cut it, we'll edit it, it'll work." - So we got the whole thing ready, I felt we had to do more with it to build up the fight between Dracula and the Frankenstein monster and we shot that in New York. - The two monsters facing one another, never been done in a film before. - We were all walking up to this church, when the first guy opened the door to go in there and we all saw a bat fly out, oh well, that's an omen, you know, they're looking at me and they said, "You have anything to do with that?" And I'm wearing clown white, I had a makeup person in Hollywood, but here I'm wearing clown white and store bought plastic Halloween fangs that hurt. At some point, Frankenstein gives me a look and there begins our struggle. (ominous suspenseful music) Looks like we're dancing and Al's directing, "A little more, a little less." Stop or I'll destroy you piece by piece. And that's when I start tearing him limb from limb and finally the head. (ominous suspenseful music) - "Dracula vs. Frankenstein," you know, they are such famous names, it automatically was a marketing tool. - [Announcer] Together in one film, they meet in a fight of fright, the kings of horror battle to the death. "Dracula vs. Frankenstein." - The Riverlea Theater marquee had "Dracula vs. Frankenstein" on it and I was like a magnet, you know, you're dealing with a young teenager, who is reading Famous Monsters and he sees "Dracula vs. Frankenstein" on the cover, I knew I had to see it. - [Announcer] A doctor who serves the dead and the living creature horribly created from the mangled corpses of their victims. - And when I finally did see it, I don't even know how to describe it, you're glad that it was as good as it was and not as good as it was. - They had a nice run there making movies and selling them mostly to drive-ins and grindhouses for a while, Sam Sherman and Al Adamson movies are all over the place. - They were like the dream team of tits and terror movies. (screaming) (melodic upbeat music) - [Announcer] How many ways can you distort the human mind? (explosive booming) - There really were homes for these pictures back then, they would play on 42nd Street and then play in the inner cities. Theater owners weren't watching the films, they were looking at the campaigns. - [Samuel] They would just take it based on a title and an ad sheet. - The press books, the posters, sometimes I wonder of they spent more money on those than they did on the movies themselves. - All of our films were made with the title and the campaign in front. - The films were definitely, I think set up ahead of time and booked ahead of time and then maybe finished just in the nick of time. - Almost every title and campaign came out of Sam Sherman's head, that's his department. We had great artwork and great campaigns, I just tried to make the best possible film with what we had to work with, which they would say, "This is how much money we have," and I'd go out and make the film, whatever the budget was. - You can't wait to see them, even though you kind of know it's not going to be very good. - Most of my reviews have been bad. - [Samuel] They think Al and myself were a bunch of incompetents, who made all these patch jobs, we didn't know what we were doing. - [Al] We never ever went out to make a bad film, I don't think anybody goes out to make a bad film. - What happened to me? - If you look at some of your great directors, they have never made 32 films. - Obviously he wasn't a great director, you know a lot of directors start off making B movies, but they usually graduate. - They're taking a film and comparing it with a $10 million movie and these films didn't cost that kind of money. (gasping) So we didn't have a great script. - A friend of my father's just called me and Lieutenant Cross told me to call him, if any of my father's friends did contact me. - I'm sure that Lieutenant Cross will be interested in what you have to say. - Okay, thank you. - So we didn't have a great actor. - The good Lord does not approve of such carryings on. - My films were made for the average person, not for reviewers. - Take a look at this. - What's interesting with Al is he can see a lot of the trends and exploitations that were going on. - For a brief period in the early '70s, black cast movies were a big deal. - And I said how can we make just white movies? - You jive turkey, you're just trying to get in my pants. - Al was nice to every one of his actors, any of you actors say anything bad about him, you're lying. - They had purchased the rights to one of the books in the paperback series, "Black Samurai." - [Michael] Kind of spy, kung fu thing. - "Black Samurai," that was Jim Kelly. - [Announcer] Codename, "Black Samurai." - I was like oh, my goodness. It would've been smarter of you to have been nicer to me. - So Jim Kelly and I were going after the bad guy and he was up there with his vulture, (vulture squawking) and his henchmen were dwarves. - Argh! - Fighting with the dwarves, that was a riot, they were good guys and then that vulture. - Fulton, kill! (vulture squawking) - Right through the "70s, there was a distinct line between union and non-union, on the union side was nothing but rules, Al couldn't make a movie that way, but on Al's side, the non-union side. - Okay, let's roll it! - We all did everything. - We'd all end up acting, we were all in a shot someplace. - My head ended up being sent in a box to the police station. - Gary Graver's worked for me as an actor. - Man, it's a real bummer! - And we've used that, "It's a bummer,” every time we see Graver. - It was like a young family going let's go make a movie! - We'd go out and rent cars and do car chases, when you take 'em back to the rental place, they're all clunkety clunkety clunk. - Son of a bitch! - This is the way these kind of movies were made. - Cheap and fast. - Al was a one-shot guy, you know, as far as he was concerned, if you did it in two takes, you've wasted half of your time. - If you miss the line, too bad, it's a take! - One time Al had to do five takes of a scene, he was infuriated, Gary opened the camera, there was no film in the camera and it's like on any other movie you would've been fired for that and he had to tell Al, "I don't know what to tell you, "there was no film in the camera." "There wasn't? "Oh, thank God, we would've wasted all that film." - Al allowed people to come and make mistakes on his movie. - We represented something he needed, youth, energy and he was providing something we all needed a lot, opportunity. - I wouldn't give those days up, I wouldn't wanna do it now, but I wouldn't give 'em up for anything. - You could complain about certain people, who you knew were exploiting it, but Al didn't make you feel that way, they liked that. - In my mind's eye I can see Al standing there holding his dog. - Sh! (dog barking) - No. - Everywhere he went, hm, "Cut, print," he had this dog. - If I didn't see him put the dog down a couple of times, I'd think he might've been sewn to his arm or something. - [Anie] And then if he didn't have it, he'd hand it off to Regina. - She was not able to bear children, so as Al said, "We have dogs." - A lot of B movie people are definitely left of center and very odd, you know, Ted Mikels living with 10 women in a castle, Ed Wood wearing women's clothes and the way I understood about Al was he was just like a normal like everyday kind of guy, people said to me he probably would've been a mailman, but he happened to make these really bizarre, sleazy B movies. - There was a European movie that came out in 3D called "The Stewardesses" and it made a lot of money, Sam and Al decided to capitalize on that and they made two stewardesses movies. - First one was "The Naughty Stewardesses," Sam wrote it. - The one dispute I ever had with him, he said, "This looks like an 8th Avenue nudey to me, "I don't want any part of it." I said let me tell you something, this picture's gonna be in the can and finished whether you do it or not. "Forget what I said, we'll do the picture.” Al's funny. - Let me guess, you had a wild weekend? - Always. - I was about 13 at the time and my role was to turn around and notice that something was going on behind us. - Come here. - [Sean] That was a bit inappropriate, the captain and the flight attendant doing some rather adult activities. - The woman from the airline saw this, shut the whole thing down. - [Announcer] Fly first class with "The Naughty Stewardesses," your hostesses on the wildest flights you'll ever take. - [Samuel] The picture came out. - [Announcer] All new for adults. - And what did we do? We created a phony organization called Stewardesses For a Better Image protesting the movie, "The Naughty Stewardesses," a couple of people felt it was a phony, they called and for a week Regina answered the phone, "Stewardesses For a Better Image." - [Announcer] They're sweet, but know the score. - Biggest hit for IP, just went through the roof. "The Naughty Stewardesses" led to one sequel, "Blazing Stewardesses" and Al didn't wanna do that either, but I wanted to do an old western. - [Chris] So they made a stewardess movie that was really about cowboys and old Republic westerns. - I had The Three Stooges planning to be in a film. - Well, The Two Stooges, what was left, one of them got very ill, so we replaced the Stooges with the two remaining Ritz brothers. - I don't know who would remember The Ritz Brothers, you'd have to have been involved in vaudeville, I think. (cheerful melodic music) - It's a throwback film being sold as a stewardess movie and also trying to cash in on "Blazing Saddles," there's a subplot about trucks that are being hijacked and a couple of years later Sam was able to re-release it as "The Great Truck Robbery" to cash in on the whole "Convoy," "Smokey and the Bandit" craze and when "Best little Whorehouse in Texas" came out, Sam re-released "Blazing Stewardesses” as "Cathouse Cowgirls." - Sometimes there'd be five titles for the same movie and three different campaigns, "Black Heat" and "Girls' Hotel" are the same movie as "The Murder Gang," - Suddenly the clouds parted, this is the same movie. - Didn't I see this before? - People would get tricked into seeing the same movie again and maybe again, it's conman stuff. - I looked at this video box that says, "I Spit on Your Corpse," I said, my God, who made this thing? I turned around, there's some stills, I said I shot this, it was "Girls For Rent" and Sam had retitled it and repackaged it. - [Announcer] Looking for salvation, the organization's gals have got it in "Girls For Rent." - Irwin Pizor, one of my partners, former head of Hemisphere Pictures wanted a porno star, we got 'em, Georgina Spelvin. - [Announcer] Now you can see Georgina Spelvin, star of "The Devil in Miss Jones" at a theater near you in "Girls For Rent." - [Samuel] We made it in the least time we ever made anything, 60 days from script to screen, Georgina Spelvin looked at me and she said, "This is too much like hard work, "I'm going back to fuck films." - Roll over, cowboy. - [Al] We put sex in almost every film we did. - This is going to fun. - The hottest one we probably shot was "Cinderella 2000," we were trying to do a musical, comedy, science-fiction, sex film. - Here I lie getting hornier and hornier. - [All] We know what you need, Snow White. - Angelo Rossitto was, "Oh, my God, like a bunch of dwarves "having an orgy with Snow White, this is too much,” he wouldn't be in the scene. - Our musical numbers were handicapped because of the fact we didn't have a lot of money, but the score is excellent. ♪ And we are doing without ♪ ♪ Yes, we are doing without ♪ - And we were making money with these pictures. The major studios started seeing the success of our company, of AIP, of Roger Corman, they were ignoring the drive-ins in those days, they were just strictly for second features and they finally started saying, hey, there's a market out there. (glass shattering) - [Announcer] "National Lampoon's Animal House." - The majors started taking over the drive-in screens. - Especially right after "Jaws," a lot of the independent companies were really getting shut out by the studios. - [Al] We were very successful all through the '70s, until the drive-in market went to nothing. - I think we found that his unique talent and abilities just didn't transfer as well to other films. - He tried different things. - A children's film of all things. - [Announcer] "Carnival Magic," the excitement, the thrill, the adventure of the carnival. - They just hired him, because it was a guy that could get the job done. - [Announcer] See Alexander the Great drive everyone crazy. - One day we heard this screaming and we all turned around and Trudi the Chimp had Shorty the Dwarf holding on to him, climbing the tree, his little legs were just kicking, he's going, "Help me, help!" - The woman's always scratching the monkey and it looks like she's giving him a hand job. - Now don't be too nice to him, he's on six months' probation for driving without a license. - Wait a minute, a woman's giving a monkey a hand job in a children's film? - This chimp was beyond the age that you would use it in a circus, very dangerous, did send a few people to the hospital. She knocked out the script supervisor, grabs her by the head and goes pow! And knocked her out cold, she was in the hospital with a concussion. - [Announcer] The most amazing thing you'll ever see, a talking chimpanzee. - Yeah. - What's funny is in the movie that the chimp talks. - Some coconuts, hm. - That wasn't part of the story, yeah. - We shot nothing like that. - I heard that later, like the chimp talks? - That's one of his last movies, I mean, it's crazy and it's really cheap, but it could be his best directed film. - It's been a long day, but it's good to be together. - Hm-mm. - It's important to have someone to share things with. Life alone can be very sad. (melodic melancholic music) - Poor Gina, she happened to get this cancer business. - Al was always after her to stop smoking, he could never get anywhere with that. - I know there was a big problem between the two of them, he wanted her to quit smoking and she couldn't. - He gave her the best care, he took her to all the best doctors and places and he said, "My thinking is I'll keep her alive for a year "and then medical science will advance." - Really sad to see a young lady like that with all that talent pass away. - [Samuel] Gina died in November of '92, it was a great tragedy. - Regina was a wonderful person, she was always kind, she was always helping other people. She was one of the bright things in my life. - That was really sad and I think that's what took Al away. - He was so totally broken as a person. - He was so involved with her, that everything else was nothing. - Because Regina had passed away, he really didn't have time to continue with the movie making. (mellow melodic music) He just decided to concentrate solely on his business ventures. - [Samuel] Al tended to be a Will-o'-the-wisp, one day he's in north Hollywood, the next day he's in Utah, he'd buy a house, he'd live in it, he'd sell it and he'd be off somewhere else. Eventually he had a house in Indio south of Palm Springs, which he used to like to stay at. (speaking in foreign language) - I remember going up and seeing him there, Al was so proud of his Jacuzzi he had over there. - [Ken] That Jacuzzi, I guess it was more than just pleasure, but it was also therapy. (gentle piano music) - I would visit with Sam and we'd do things and so, then he got involved with UFOs. - There were a lot of sightings around that time, I was thinking of doing a docudrama feature. - We're sitting at lunch and he was brainstorming, ba ba ba bub bub bub, and before you know it, he had gotten financing through some friends to produce a UFO documentary with Al Adamson directing. - I said, Al, I wanna come over the project of what I called, "Mysterious Reality," something weird that might be true, we'll do dramatic scenes, we'll do documentary scenes. He said to me, he said, "I don't believe in any of this, "I'm just gonna film some of these things "and treat it like fiction, I've no problem with it." Boy, did he change. - So what are your conclusions if any, Mr. Adamson, your guess is as good as anybody, ‘cause nobody ever came back and said, you know, what they found out really? - Yeah, there's no real proof anywhere, but there's an awful lot of believers and an awful lot of intelligent people, that believe that there are UFOs out there. - What do you think, Stevee? - I believe there's a lot of things that we don't know, a lot of things that are unexplained and that's where I'm leaving it. - Is this your leading lady? - Yes, Stevee Ashlock. - I first met Al as I came to audition for him, he was looking for an American actress to take to Australia to play a part of a woman who was abducted by aliens. UFOs have always been something that has intrigued me. - That's important, right, Al? - Right. - Al had decided that he could sit in his house and grieve or he can get back into life and move on, ‘cause no matter what he was gonna do, it wasn't gonna bring her back. - Has she got the part, Al? - Well, you know, why not? - And I resemble Regina quite a bit, Al decided that it was the perfect combination and everything just kind of fell into place. Over the past few years I've had flashbacks of that night. - It was a pretty good shoot, it was pretty fast, it was only a few days, but I was the only person who knew who Adamson was, a lot of the crew thought he was a hack, I don't know if they did some research on him, no one was getting paid really, so they thought he was a bit of cheapskate and he came out with Stevee, she was on set most of the time, they were professional, but when the camera stopped, you could see the affection between the two of them. It was in and out straightaway, but you know, for me to be working alongside him was great. - And the scenes he directed were very good. - There seems to be a large aircraft below 5,000. - [Tim] He shot some really nice stuff. - Delta Sierra Juliet, this is Melbourne, what type of aircraft is it? - [Pilot] It's hovering on top of me, it's not an aircraft. - I end up spending a bloody fortune, sending Al all over the world. - When we were in Turin, Italy, do you know that Turin, Italy is the world headquarters for the UFOs and they said, "Would you like to go into the vault?" And I go, what vault? They let you in with a key, they lock you in there and it's like these file cabinets go from the ceiling to the floor and there's these files all the way around. - So it's all the case for just one year, it's about 50 boxes collected. You know, we have a secret part, where we keep the bodies of the enemies too. (laughing) - He did his own investigations and he was getting very deeply into this, I was worried about him. - [Interviewer] What do you mean by, "He was getting so deeply into it?" - People he was in touch with and things that were happening, which I'm not gonna repeat. - Al was completely a non-believer before this day that he met this person, after this particular meeting, he came back a believer in aliens. - [Interviewer] So what happened in this meeting? - I don't know if I'm at liberty to really say exactly what happened in the meeting, but I can tell you that he met a being, let's just call it a being, that was half alien and half human and it had documentation and everything, that it, was not from Earth it was very strange. You know, and Al saw it and saw the documentation and again, Al was the kind of person, that if he didn't see it, he didn't believe it and he saw it with his own eyes, spoke to this being and came back a believer. - I said I think we should get off some of this. - Why does the government protect people from knowing more about this though? - I think they're afraid that the people will panic. - Oh, is that the reason? - I think so. - We made like a pact that we would keep it to ourselves and we wouldn't tell anybody else. - It was I thought dangerous. - I felt like the woman that knew too much and I was afraid now I have information that could get me killed. (light haunting music) I just don't think it's safe. We already knew that the government was trying to, well, we knew, ‘cause they will look normal, but if you look at their eyes and you look like, are we filming? - [Interviewer] We are filming, yes. So where does the film stand now? - Not finished, there's enough footage for three films, but what can I say? You're running, you got all that? - [Interviewer] Yep. - The production just slowed down and stopped, it got a bit too hairy to be around quite frankly, because I think there are people or forces or whatever, who, you've gone far enough, that's it, we're not gonna let you go any further and that's it. - On the other hand perhaps I don't wanna know. (mellow melodic music) - [Samuel] Stevee was his lady friend at the time, they had a house together up in Vegas. - One day when the doorbell rang, I thought it was the gardener, but instead this scary man was standing at the door and he was real shifty and he looked homeless and he wouldn't look me in the eye and I was so taken back when I opened the door, I slammed the door and I locked the door and Al was coming down the steps at the time when I did it and he said, "Stevee, why are you being so rude?" And then he goes over and opens the door and he starts to invite this person in, come to find out that was Fred and so Fred's talking to him and trying to get a job from Al, he says, "Oh, is there anything you need done on the house, "you know, I'll help you and I'll work cheap," and this and that, Al's going, "Cheap? "Stevee has all these honeydew lists, "that she wants me to do and I could make a deal," and Al was all about deals, you know, so Al makes a deal and Fred starts working for us. (melodic haunting music) - Fred was building stuff for my brother, you know, things around his new house. - Adamson was a little bit on the, how should I say? On the side of always saving money and not spending a whole lot of money, so Fred came at a cheap price. - I noticed that Fred started behaving strangely, Al wore his hair in a very unique way, he kind of combed it straight back, so Fred started wearing his hair that way. Well, then he had those Pierre Cardin type shirts, that he would wear, well, Fred started wearing those. There was one day when Brit and I came home from the store, we had a bunch of stuff in the truck and it was kind of dusk out and we pulled up in the driveway and I thought it was Al standing at the top by the garage and I said, Brit, get out and ask Al to come help us unload the truck and so Brit gets out and goes, "Al, Al!" And the person turns around, it was Fred and we were going, oh, God, it was creepy. - [Interviewer] Did you discuss this with Al? - Yes and Al, he goes, "Oh, Stevee, you're just doing your woman thing," everything was like my woman thing. - I couldn't believe some of the things that he'd done, but I guess he knew what he was doing, I told my brother, I said you know, does Fred know what he's doing here? And he's, "Oh yeah, he knows all that stuff, he's okay." - I got out the bank statements one day and the checkbooks and I started looking at things and things weren't adding up and so I laid out all the paperwork and then when Al came back, I showed it to Al and I said, does this make sense to you? And I saw Al get really kind of angry, now he's not a person that gets angry. - Fred Fulford had apparently obtained one of Mr. Adamson's credit cards in his own name and had been using it. - And I said, well, we need to fire him and Al was like, "Oh, no, no, no, "we're gonna make him work it off." I said he's a thief, I said give him $200, take him into the driveway, say thank you very much, "Oh, you just don't like him." Well yeah, I don't like him, there's a reason I don't like him, you shouldn't like him, but you know, he was like, "He's only Fred." (mellow melodic music) - [Samuel] So it led to a fight and Al left, he went to stay in his house in Indio. - [Stevee] Al came up with this plan, he says, "Well, if I put him in the middle of nowhere, "he can't do anything wrong, "he can't steal from us, he can't do anything." Oh yeah, he can. - [Interviewer] Well, do you wanna go get it? You wanna stop for a second? - I thought Fred would get it. (speaking in foreign language) - He had asked her more than just to do housekeeping, but help him decorate, help him make some decisions, because she lived in a mobile home adjacent to his estate. (speaking in foreign language) - It was during that time that Fred started to enjoy a lot of Al Adamson's daily life and not getting the work done, that he was contracted to do. (speaking in foreign language) - One day I got a phone call from this guy named Robert, one of the workers at the house, Robert goes, "Stevee, do you know what Fred's doing?" Good Lord, I don't know what, as soon as Al would drive out the driveway, he would load up all the supplies that Al just bought, take 'em back to Maynard's and he had the receipt, he would go back and get the cash back. - I talked to Gary Graver and Gary Graver said, "Hey, Al would love to talk to you, he's in Palm Springs." I called Al and it was 10, 11 years and it was just wonderful talking to him and he said, "Il have only one problem, "a guy that's been working for me has been stealing from me "and I'm gonna confront him and if he doesn't pay me, "I'm gonna throw the son of a bitch in jail." - On the phone he said Fred had been stealing from him, he'd got to get rid of Fred. I said yeah, wait, don't do nothing, Al, till I get there, we'll try and take care of this together and get Fred to move out. (melodic haunting music) (speaking in foreign language) - I get there about 11 o'clock, 11:30 and I said where's my brother? He says, "Oh, he's out looking at a car.” I said Fred, looking at a car, what the hell for? He had four cars then, he said, "You know your brother, he said he'd be back in a while." So I left and went home and then I got halfway home, I call back, 'cause I lived two hours from Al's house. I called back and I said, is he there yet? And he said, "No, he's not here yet, "he's still out looking at the cars." (speaking in foreign language) - The next day, I came, where is he? "We don't know, nobody knows where he's at." (speaking in foreign language) (melodic haunting music) - And I call him again and he said, "No," he said, "He's in Texas looking at his property." (speaking in foreign language) - So another couple of weeks go by and still nothing and my brother never did that to me. - I wasn't even thinking of him I was just thinking if he didn't call me back, maybe he was sick or he went out of town or something. (speaking in foreign language) - He had had a Post Office drop box welded with a lock and he actually placed it on the property, because there was money checks coming in, credit cards, he didn't want anybody to access any of that. (speaking in foreign language) - I had a friend looking for him in Mexico, we were looking all over the country, maybe he's sick in a hospital somewhere, maybe he was kidnapped, maybe someone's holding him somewhere. (speaking in foreign language) - I went back down there and talked to Fred again and wanting to know where the hell he was, he should know where he was at, he was working for him. - Fred wouldn't allow him to go into the home and used the excuse that he had just resealed the entire floor of the residence with this lacquer seal. - I called the police. - Once Al was reported missing, they began an investigation, it needed a follow up to make sure he wasn't just somewhere, you know, he had a yacht in Hawaii, they had property, Al had property all over the United States, so it needed a follow up to make sure he wasn't just somewhere enjoying a vacation or whatever, just wanted to get away. - They were getting nowhere, just nowhere, I said to Linda, I'm gonna concentrate in my mind as much as I could concentrate and try to reach him, wherever he is. - I said how can you do that? I mean, that's farfetched, he said, "I've got to." - And I'm lying in bed and I'm saying, Al, I don't know where you are, if you're sick, if you're dead, if you're whatever, you've got to give me a sign and one word comes through into my mind, cement. (mellow melodic music) (speaking in foreign language) - And I called back the police department again and I said you know, something's wrong. - At the time I took the report, I walked over all the information and the detectives went out there and Fred was nowhere to be seen. - [Daniel] Then Detective Jack Anderson went to the home with a couple of officers with the search warrant in his possession. They went there with the housekeeper, who used to live on the property, Guadalupe. - Tapes. One of his pamphlets from one of his movies. So we started doing our search looking through invoices, records, credit card receipts, so we could get the credit card numbers and try and track him down. Lupe was walking us through the house. (speaking in foreign language) - At one point we were walking through the lower level of the house and she pointed out a room, where there used to be an in-ground Jacuzzi. She explained how Al really loved that, because it was indoors. (speaking in foreign language) - [Jack] A big piece right here, the Jacuzzi? (speaking in foreign language) - And it had all been tiled over. Ceramic tiles, shovel, sledgehammer. She suddenly broke down into tears. (speaking in foreign language) (mellow upbeat music) - We were using picks, we were using shovels, we were breaking up the cement, we went at it all night and it was in the midsummer too, SO we were very hot, I would say all that night was close to the hundreds. (mellow melodic music) - It took five or six hours and then we started pulling out the cinder blocks. - The investigators and the officers worked throughout the night. - And finally we got down to a level of dirt. There's a strong odor of decomposition coming from the area in question. - Oh, that smell. - [Benjamin] And it was extremely hot, So yes, there is a very strong smell or odor that comes out and develops. - And it's kind of like okay, we're on the right track, that's when everything got slower, because they had to be a lot more careful and it was piece by piece, they started using brushes. - As we continued on down, we found what appeared to be a body wrapped in cloth. (speaking in foreign language) - [Jack] The coroner's autopsy was able to determine the body had what appeared to be several blows to the head. - On the death certificate, it said blunt force trauma. - From a circular type object similar to a hammer. Once we had determined that there had been a murder, now we are looking for a suspect. - Fred Fulford was a construction person, very well acquainted with a hammer. He got help to chip out the in-ground Jacuzzi by a couple of laborers, he also had those same laborers help him remove a mattress from the bedroom. We talked to the laborers, who said they didn't go looking at the mattress, it was just trash ready to be hauled off. - We found where Mr. Fulford had been cashing checks by forging Al Adamson's name. As part of our search of the residence, we did find a couple of envelopes that had Fred Fulford's name on them and the return address was in Florida, we traced Al Adamson's credit card and we found that it had actually been used in Florida within the last day or two and he had shipped a few of the cars belonging to the victim to an area in Florida. - I get called into the chief's office and the chief says, "Pack your bags, you're going to Florida." - When Mr. Fulford went to Florida, he took a girlfriend with him, who happened to be related to Lupe. (speaking in foreign language) - The sister had a child from a previous relationship with her, so we wanna know are they okay, ‘cause we figured if someone does something wrong and takes someone's life, what will they do if something else happens? - If he finds out that we're looking for him or that he's a suspect, what is he gonna do with his girlfriend and the child? - We're trying to tell the family everything will be okay, but we don't really know. - We did a search of Fred Fulford's mother's home there in Florida and found a lot of his clothing and a lot of his girlfriend's clothing there. - Let's check the airport to see if maybe he'll get his girlfriend and the baby on a flight back to California, lo and behold, he ends up getting her a flight. We cut her off before she boarded the plane and we took her into a room and that's where we started interviewing her. At first she couldn't believe it, she's just, "He's so nice." In going through her property, there was a book of matches, a hotel on the beach and it was one of those things, we said, hey, why would she have this, unless they're staying there, so we figured we had to move. We started SWAT rolling to that hotel and we rolling that way also, we get there and I personally got a little antsy, I said you know what, I wanna have an eye on what's going on inside. I made my way inside waiting for SWAT to show up, I was probably there five, 10 minutes, who walks in through the doors? And I took my gun out, drew down on him, identified myself, I told him to get down, to keep his hands up, get down on the ground, luckily he did. - [Presenter] Police believe the man who murdered and buried Adamson was this man, Fred Fulford, a part-time builder, who was remodeling Al's home. - [Fred] I met Al in Las Vegas, he wanted a builder to do some custom work, I worked there for a year or something like that, close to it. He was my good friend anyway, I never had no problems, we never argued about nothing and then he hired me to of to Indio, California to do a job over there, I didn't wanna go, but he made a deal with me. - [Presenter] Police now say money may have been the motive for the murder. - [Fred] His agreement was I stay in Indio and work there, I used my skill and my labor and when we finish it, we sell it and we split the profits. The house was like mine and his, place was a real mess, I spent a lot of time, a lot of work on it and a lot of money, I worked for 10 months for nothing, I didn't get nothing, I got everything taken from me. - Mr. Adamson was someone who was successful, someone that was famous, someone that had a lot of money and I think my client kind of wanted a little bit of that lifestyle. Part of the theory of the prosecution was that he wanted to embezzle and once he had been caught, Mr. Adamson supposedly indicated that he was gonna turn him over to the police and he didn't want that, So supposedly that's why he committed the murder. - We believe that Al had confronted Fred and then Fred had bludgeoned him to death. - But he denied any involvement in the murder. - [Fred] The prosecutor made it sound like I snuck off to Florida, didn't tell nobody, everybody knew where I was going, I was going to visit my mother. I have my own clothes, but Al gave me a lot of things, I didn't steal 'em, they were mine, he gave ‘em to me. That Jacuzzi was old and did not work and as far as vehicles, I've worked for those vehicles, I remodeled the whole house and whatever materials I'd buy, I would use his check account, he let me sign checks, it made me look guilty, sure I looked guilty. I got blamed for everything and the point is this, I did not kill Al, everything they said was not true, I was just railroaded completely. - [Daniel] And the result was they found Fred guilty of murder. - The jury only deliberated for a matter of hours. - Two hours, that's wow, I mean, there was just zero, zero, I mean, you talk about reasonable doubt, there was zero doubt. - He was sentenced to 25 to life, I believe there's appeal processes, he's made his appeal and they were upheld, so you know. - [Presenter] Why Fulford would murder Adamson, bury his body and think that no one would ever know is still a major question the police-- - By burying him in the house, where he is the construction guy, all it's doing is drawing an arrow to him, if he killed him, why didn't he just take the body out into the middle of the desert, where it won't be found for 10,000 years? - I don't really think he really thought this out. - If people that commit crimes were smart, we'd have a hard time catching them. - There was an article in an LA paper that said, Sam Sherman says aliens killed Al Adamson, what bullshit, I never said anything like that, but people can draw their own conclusions. - Macabre death. - Cement grave. - And they do. - It's a chilling story. - UFO docudrama. - The mystery. - [Presenter] Buried inside his own house. - But I've had to accept the verdict, because the key thing was Al was gone, no matter what I would look at as some irregularity, it's not gonna bring him back. - Oh, I don't really know what else I could tell you about Al. (gentle piano music) Believe me, he was good, my brother was good. - I was very, very happy to be his friend and co-worker. - I miss Al, Al was a great guy. - I'd have worked for Al, if I became the biggest movie star in the world, I would still work for Al. - Even though he was difficult, even though he was a strange kind of a character, I have to give him thanks, maybe even thanks for not paying me, ‘cause not paying me made me go out and make my own movies. - He said, "You laugh about the conditions, "you laugh about my movie scripts, you this and that, "but when you make it big, Mike Ferris," and he used to look, "and you will, "then you'll look back and you'll thank old Al." And I have many times. - In our last conversation, Al had been to several conventions like Chiller Theater and he was shocked that he had all of these fans, so he was telling me, "Gary, I was there "and they showed my film and they loved it, "you'd be surprised, I have fans in England.” He was so pleased. - They were pieces of shit when we shot 'em, but then later on they've become relics. - Were they my favorite? They were fun. - Let's face it, he made a lot of little pictures and 90% of them made some money. - And when Al was asked at a screening in LA, "What was the purpose of you doing all these films?" And Al answered. - We're not shooting for Academy Awards, when we make pictures, we're shooting to entertain the audiences and I think we did that. (screaming) (melodic upbeat music)
