Who the fuck is this guy? - Just a wise guy, I picked up down the street. Wise guy, huh? Oh, that's what I am, Carlos? - Luck, my friend, like the wind, can always change. - Okay. All right, why don't you just deal another hand, we'll see how it change. It's not over yet, buddy. - Yeah. So keep playing. - I'll keep playin' all right. You sure you want me to keep playin'? I keep playin', I keep winnin'. - Be honest, Mr. Collins, Are you always that cocky? - You call it cocky, I call it confidence. - Confidence will lead you to danger, buddy. - Hey, we tryin' to play a game here. Trouble in paradise? Not your concern, buddy. - Oh, I'm not concerned, I just don't want you to have any excuses when I whoop your ass, take all your money. - Why don't you stop clowning? It's not over yet. Go. - Gentlemen, how's the whiskey? Go give Mr. Han another whiskey. Give me another one. - Wanna play? - Yeah. Deal us one, baby. - It's not over yet. - Whoa whoa whoa whoa, wait wait wait wait wait, what are y'all, cheatin' on me now? Sendin' signals and shit? - Far from it, Mr. Collins. Carlos and I, we just closed a lucrative deal that has nothing to do with you. I can't get a decent hand around here. - I'm sorry to hear that, Frank. But you know what, guys? It's been fun, but, you know, I got to roll. I gotta go pick out my Phantom. - Hey, pal. - Yeah. - You leavin'? - Yeah. - We can't get our money back? I got to roll, baby, there's a few little chips, get you some gas, there you go, get your little daughter some little flowers or somethin'. - It's double or nothing. - You know that's 1.5 million dollars? That's three million dollars, Carlos. - Tell you what, Mr. Black Phantom. Before you go and do all this shopping, do you wanna be professional? I'll let you be professional. You know some of us came from nothing and became somebody. In my line of business I saw a lot of characters like you. You think you're a big shot now, huh? All right. I'll let you be a big shot. So why don't you set the whole bullshit in play? - That's a lot of money, Carlos. If I win, I'm gonna come collect. - Nate, Nate, Nate. Go fuck a bowl bigger than your head, huh? - Confucius, he say, "Fool stay in, "when wise men fear to bet." Me too. - Mr. Collins. You get serious when next we meet. Oh, sure. Carlos, Carlos, Carlos. See you in a week, my friend. - I'm expecting you. Frankie. - This just got very interesting. I'll see you in a week as well. Why can't we talk business? - Frankie, have a safe flight to Atlantic City, huh? Say hello to everybody. Don't lock the gates. Boss is gonna love this one. - Is that the deposit? - Yes. 50 grand now. The rest after the job is done. Fuck! Why did she lie to me? No one can accuse me of beating her badly. - Mr. Han, if you don't mind me askin'. How much money did she take from you? - Nearly one million. In less than two years. And the bitch even stole my stash of cocaine to feed her monstrous habit! - There you go. That's more than enough right there. - Exactly! So just do the job cleanly. You understand? I don't want no shit traced back to me! - Mr. Han. I assure you nothin's gonna come back to you. All I need you to do, is just go about your business. Make sure you're seen out with others. Just in case you need a alibi, if it comes to that. Hey, you leave the rest to me. This bitch ain't takin' nobody else's money. - Thank you. Good man. - Damn, she fucked him up. Hey, baby, make yourself a drink. I'll be right out. Daddy. Who are you? Where's Freddie? - Fred couldn't make it. So I'm here to take you out. - We weren't planning on going out. - Hmm, Alexya Benjamin? You have some powder on your nose. Which is why I'm here. You owe Mr. Han for that nose habit. - What does he want, huh? What? - Another time, another place. I'm sorry. Business is business. - Come on, Donnie, man, let me outta here. - You want me to let you outta here? Do I look like I have a death wish? - Look, I can go get his money. I can have his money in a day. - You tell him that. Get him outta here, call Charlie. Charlie! - Look, Carlos, I was robbed. Those fools set me up. - You went to Compton by yourself. You asked to get robbed. - I didn't ask. - You asked to get robbed. - I just panicked, that's all. Look, they were a new connection from San Diego. Word on the street was, they had the best shit in town. I had to make the deal. - You know, Ramon, this story adds up. You're probably the dumbest cabron in the world, but if you've fuckin' lied to me, and I hope you don't lie to me. - Uncle Carlos, I wouldn't lie to you. I would never lie to you, just, Just give me one more shot. I... Look, Tio, just give me one more day, I can, I can come up with the whole $250,000 dollars. All right? I mean, you're my uncle. I'm your nephew, we're family! I'm your-- - He saved your fuckin' life because you are my fuckin' family. So I'll give you 24 hours to get my fuckin' money. Don't eat, don't shit, don't fuckin' take a shower. Don't fuck with me. You got 24 hours. - Come on, let's go. Come on. Go! - What's up, ladies? - Who's that? Looks like Nate. Hey, sexy. - Hello, babe. Good job on the hit yesterday. - Don't we always come through? - Yeah, when y'all ain't fighting. - Whatever. Where you just gettin' from? Damn! - What the fuck, Nate? What the fuck's wrong with this dude? - The Alexya Benjamin hit. - I thought that was our target. - It was. I got word she was 'bout to skip town. And I know Jazz has a problem takin' out women, so I took care of it myself. This man has gotta be known for handlin' business when it come time to handle business. Other than that, might just end up goin' someplace else. Come on, baby. - That didn't take much. - What's it gonna take for you? - A whole lot. - Why you always give me shit? - 'Cause it's true. All right, guys, um... You guys just wait out here, all right? Mr. Han, he doesn't know you guys uh... I'll have to go in here by myself and take care of this. All right, you guys just sit tight, I'll be right back. - We'll be here. All right. - Mai Ling. - What are you doing here, Ramon? We're very busy right now. - Look, I need to talk to Mr. Han. - He's not here, Ramon. - I'm here to spend some serious money, Mai Ling. If you don't want-- - Wait. Just a minute. Ramon says he wants to make a large purchase. I said Mr. Han wasn't here. What do you want to do? - Let him in. What's up, Ramon? - With all due respect, I'm here to see Mr. Han. - You wanna buy more nose candy? - I don't think so. Kwan! Look, I want the money and the drugs now! - What are you gonna do? Kill him? - I'll do it! Goddammit I'll do it! - Do it, Ramon, kill him. - Fuck you, bitch, you don't think I'll do it? - Stop talking and just do it. - Look, I'm gonna give you one more chance to give me the dope and the money. - No need to give us chances. Just pull the trigger. Ramon, Ramon. What am I gonna do with you? Don't you know? You don't bite the hand that feeds you. - You think Carlos sent him? - No. This isn't his style. Get him outta here. Take him back to Carlos. Mai Ling! Take the scenic route. - Let's go. - It's like, man, it was, you should've seen this body on this-- - Hey, hey. What are they doin' with Ramon, man? - I don't know, but we gotta go help him. Okay, you take the chick, I'll take the guy. Hey, watch out for the gun. All right, let's go. Hey. Ah, shit! Kwan! - Watch out, behind you! - Freeze, bitch. Don't move. Don't even think about it. Get over here, untie me. - Get down, on the ground. - Come on, let's go. - Let's go! Mm. Wow. What, now? - All right. Jen, it's Jen, I don't know. But I'll, I'll just deal with it tomorrow. What? - You know I love you, right? - Of course, David. - You know I can't lose you, right? Come on, you're being silly. I want you to relax. - All right. And I'll do all the work. - Okay. What the fuck? - It's-- - Sally, from who? It's obviously important. Right? She knows what we do about this time of the night. So like, she, she wants in on it. That's what it is. - You're being stupid. - Yeah, I'm being stupid. - If you wanna be like that, maybe we should just have sex another night. Hmm? - That's fine. - Okay, great. - That's fine. I'll get out my Penthouse collection. Fuck it. Fuckin' A. - Hey, honey. - Oh, don't honey me, where are you? I been trying to reach you for an hour. - I'm goin' on my jog. - What are you doing jogging at a time like this? Your daughter's recital is in an hour. Look, I'll be there, okay? Don't worry about it. - Don't worry about it. What do you mean, don't worry about it? This is the third time you've done this, Summer, it's getting ridiculous. Look, I'm your lover, not your babysitter. - Look, I don't need you telling me what to do. It's ridiculous, okay? I'm going on my jog, and then I'll be there. God, you're starting to sound like my husband. - Whatever. Let's just hope your husband doesn't find out about me and you and that our affair continues to remain a secret. - You know it's nothing. - Yeah, let's hope not. Look, just get here as soon as you can, okay? She keeps asking if you're coming. - Jeff, stop worrying. - Summer, you better not let this girl down again. - I won't, all right? - Well is she coming? - Well I tried to get her to come here several times now. - Well that sucks, because I feel like she doesn't even care about me. Don't worry about it, Chrystal. I'll do what I can do to get her to come here now, okay? - Thanks, Jeff, I need to get to class. All right. Wow, it sure is beautiful here. You see her yet? - No, not yet. - Wait. I think I see her. Yep, affirmative, target's name is Summer. Dixie, she's headed your way. - Yeah, I see Blondie. Sure is tall. - Yeah, she a fine-ass Amazon bitch. - Really? - Oh, my bad. - Excuse me, hi. Um, is your husband's name David? - Uh, who wants to know? Who are you? What's goin' on here? - Your husband wants to see you. Help me! - That wasn't Jen on the phone. I love you, baby. I'll always love you. Hey come on, don't get weepy. - Do it. Please, no! - Yo. What are you doin'? Come on. - David, let me go! - I don't do girls. Man, I kinda liked her. - Sorry, Blondie. It's just not your day. - Thanks. I just wanted to teach her a lesson, but uh-- - I guess you did. - Well something's missing. - Hey, look, I can't help you there, bro. I'm not Dr. Phil. I'm just here to do a job. - Maybe I should have killed her boyfriend instead. How much to kill that bastard? - Same price. - And watch? - You want to watch? That's double, bro. - Yeah, all right, give me a couple weeks. - All right, you know how to reach me. - Yeah, sure thing. - What kind of sick fuck wants to watch? - Sick fuck. - Sick fuck that pays double. Torch that motherfucker. My pleazh. - Ooh, she's pissed. - Look like you in trouble tonight. - No, she'll be all right, she's just a little jelly. - Ramon. You missed the family dinner. Where've you been? No! - Now see, it took three guys to catch you. Not one, not two, three guys. - Carlos, look. I swear, man, I just need one more day. I'll have the whole $250,000 dollars. Uncle Carlos, please. - It's not about the money right now. What the fuck you think you are? - Carlos-- - Shut up! - We're family! - Shut up! You do that to me, to me? - My mom and you are brothers and sisters, man. - I fuckin' get your mother anything I can. You mess up with me. I can make this right, Uncle Carlos. - Exactly! I'm gonna make it right. Shoot him! - Wait a minute! - Damn. Other than the waterworks, you still look good. I can't believe I left you. - I think I left you. - Oh damn, you're right. It's been five years. What you need, Christine? - It's Larry. I want him dead. - You mean Larry, your boss at the strip club? That Larry? I thought you liked it over there. - I did, but Larry's got some new girls now and he's been cuttin' my hours. And then he started fucking this little Persian bitch who he's been featuring for months. And then, to make matters worse, when I started complaining, he started hitting me. - That motherfucker hit you? - I just want him dead, Nate. - Listen to me. - I know you can do it for me. - Didn't I teach you how to handle this shit yourself, huh? Motherfucker hit you? - Don't think I haven't thought about that, I just don't want it to lead back to me. - Okay, all right, well then listen. Why don't you sleep on this, okay? 'Cause you're very emotional. I mean, come on, you said you loved this guy! - No. No, Nate. You don't understand, he has to go. - How often does he hit you? Every day. Thank you. - I promise you he won't hit you again. Hello, Dixie. I got a job for you. - Wait, wait, wait! Please hold the elevator. Thank you. Thank you, these elevators are so slow, I would hate to wait for another one. - No problem, sexy. Nice eyes. - Thanks. - You're welcome. - Larry Wayne, right? - Right. How'd you know my name? Motherfuck! - Come on, stab him! Stab him! - I can't breathe! - Break his neck. - Yeah. - What's up, man? - Who is this? - It's Nate. - What the fuck you want? - I want my money, motherfucker, that's what I want. - I owed you money? No no no, you got it wrong. You owe me the money, remember that? You lost. - Oh, I got your money? Stop playin' fuckin' games, I want my money. - Listen to me very carefully, you fuckin' monkey. When I'm fuckin' finished, you gonna dance the cha-cha-cha on the fuckin' coconut tree back to Africa. Listen very careful. I want my money in fuckin' 24 hours. - Carlos. Carlos, Carlos, Carlos. Lemme explain somethin' to you. I gave you a week deadline. I usually give motherfuckers two days. Now is any kind of way for us to start a relationship? You gave me a week's? You give me a week's? I start you in this business, you ain't start me! - Fucking coffee-bean pickin' motherfucker. You and all your little burrito friends. Bring them motherfuckers all right, I got bitches that could whoop your ass. Lemme tell you somethin', if don't get my money. I'm gonna send my bitches to Mexico and I'm gonna have them search every fuckin' graveyard, and dig up your fuckin' grandmother, and then I'm gonna bring her back here and I'm gonna fuck her carcass. You understand me? I want my fuckin' money, you pice of shit. - I'll tell you what, motherfucker. I'm comin' after you. And I'm coming with everything I have. Everything, just to fuckin' show you that I'm fuckin' around. Because guess what? This is not about the money anymore. This is personal. This is fuckin' personal. Get ready, motherfucker, I'm on my way. Adios. Donnie! - Dixie, Jazzy, Angel, come here! - What's up, Nate? - What's up? - We have a problem. What's the problem? We have a situation that needs to be addressed. - What's the situation? - The situation is Mr. Carlos Enrique. - That dude you won a poker game against last week? - Yeah, that's right. I gave that motherfucker a deadline to pay me my money. And now the deadline's passed, and he's refusin' to pay. - Yep, that is a problem. - Exactly. It's a problem that needs to be addressed, fast, quick, and hard. - Carlos Enrique is the head of the Las Vegas Mexican mafia. That's a big problem. - Yeah, well it's not a problem too big for you guys, right? - No. - No, we're good. - Damn right. Fuck Charlie, I got my own angels. All right, here's what you're gonna do. I want you to go over to Carlos's spot, I want you to collect my money, then I want you to kill the bastard. And that'll send a clear message to anybody else out there that Nate Hitman Collins is not to be fucked with when it comes to my money. We together? - We got you. But no Princess this time. - Yeah, she's coolin' off. I can't work with her. - All right, all right, I heard it already. I heard she freaked out on that last hit. I'll have a talk with her. - Speak of the devil. I'll handle it. - You want a drink, Nate? - Yeah, make it a double. - Someone's goin' to the club tonight. I'm about to hit the Jacuzzi, you comin'? - You think I'm gonna let all that sexy go to waste? - Yo, Princess, lemme holler at you. What's up, baby? I been trying to teach you this business now for a year. Girls tell me you fallin' apart out there, what's up? - I know, I know. I'm sorry, Nate, it's ju-... I don't have that killer instinct, you know? It's just not in me. - It's all right, don't worry about it. I mean this shit ain't like workin' at a supermarket. I mean, it ain't for everybody. But I'm not lettin' you go, so what you wanna do? You wanna work in the office? - I just want to go home. I miss my family. I've seen shit that makes me sick to my stomach, Nate. You know I won't talk. I just... I wanna go back to my old life. I hope you understand. - You know what? You don't have to explain to me. I'm leavin' now, I'm headed for a job. I appreciate your honesty, your loyalty, and your smile. And you know what? I'm gonna take you there by myself. And since you have been real good to me, you have nothin' to worry about. So why don't you go in there and party a little bit? Hop in the Jacuzzi. No point in lettin' that bathin' suit go to waste, right? Deal? And you know what? I'm gonna make you party. - Okay. I'll see you. - Damn, that's a weak bitch. - So what's goin' on on Thursday? - Thursday, Thursday. - Thursday, we got shipment that's supposed to come-- - Oh, right. - Tijuana to Calexico. - Okay. - Now listen very careful what I want you to do. I want you to call Jose, tell him the shipment supposed to move to Chinatown. Now what I want you to do to secure the movement to Tijuana. - Okay. - You got it? - Yeah, I got it, Carlos, I got it. What about the Italians? - What about the fuckin' Italians? - They-- - Fuck them, fuck them all. - They want their money. - Why do we always have to go in these things? - Because things are gonna escalate, you know, Carlos, things are gonna escalate. - You know where we are? This is Mexico, this isn't California. This fucking gringo came here and took this country from us. Do you understand? - Carlos. - I don't fucking give about these things. - Carlos, Carlos. Look. What the fuck? You want me to take care of it? - All right, get everybody on the roof. - Right. - Go. - Turn around slowly. - I didn't know I'm throwing a bachelor party. Damn, you so beautiful. - Thanks for the compliment. But no thanks. I don't do boys. - So he sent you to do the dirty job? Such a weak man. - Hmm. At least he's not compensating for his shortcomings. - I know you're going to kill me. I know that. I saw it in my dream. Wasn't planning to die like this, you know? It's a beautiful day to die, but I wasn't planning to die like this. Oh, boy. Look, I know I'm fucked up. I know I did wrong. Didn't mean it. Didn't mean to do those kind of thing. I give you everything. I give you the car, I give you the houses. I give you anything you want, I give you all my money. Please. Don't, don't kill me. I have a daughter. She's like five years old. And she has a birthday next month. Please. I've gotta go to her birthday. Please. Her name is Juana, she's five years old. I didn't want to be involved in this business. All I try to do is be a good dad, please. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You son of a bitch. - Drop your pistols. You heard him, ladies. Ah, this is fun, ow. Oh, my God, that was fun. You came to kill me? You came to kill me, this... This is a war now! Send a woman against me? Not just one. Send three fuckin' gringas, what is it, Charlie Angels fuckin' here? Fucking cunts. Fuckin' this cunt. Fuck. Fuckin' whore. Who do you think you are, huh? This is not a romantic movie. That's what you do to me? All right, Charlie Angels, here's what I'm gonna do. I've got a plan too. Take them all. Come on. Get the fuck up. - You guys are so pretty. Since you guys are so stupid. - Fuck you, asshole. - I would love to fuck you, doggie style. - Yeah, well you need a dick for that. Ooh,. - Shut the fuck up! And stop talkin'. If you gon' kill us, then do it, be about it. - You're hurting me. That's not nice. Why you talkin' to me like that? - Where's the money you owe Nate? - That's all we want. - Wait a sec, what do you mean, all Nate's money? This is all bullshit. He owe me money, what are you talkin' about? - From the poker game last week? - He lost the game, and he owe me three million dollars. - What? - Bullshit. Nate wouldn't send us here if you didn't owe him money. - Flaca, listen to me very carefully. By my fuckin' finger, I sold two fuckin' tons of heroin, just on my word, just on my respect. - You're a fucking liar. - Well there's one thing I hate to be called, a liar. - How do we know you're tellin' us the truth? - Because I'm a businessman. I have no reason to lie to you. - Really? I can think of three million reasons. - All right, lemme tell you something. I won the game fair and square. Nate owe me three million dollars. And the deadline was past due. - Is that right? - That's right. So as far as I'm concerned, there's been a misunderstanding here. So let's forget about everything what happened. Why Nate sent you, I have no idea. Maybe he wants to eliminate you, who knows. But since I'm a businessman, I'm gonna make it right. - Yeah? How? - Nate sent you here to die on the line. Now. Since I'm a businessman, we're gonna cut a deal. - We don't make deals with fucking liars. - That's right. - But I'm gonna cut you a dealer's stake, if you'll take it. All you have to do is just go to Nate, get my three million dollars and get him here dead or alive. Now, he always braggin' about an old RV and all that stuff. So what I want you to do, I want you to go out there and get it before him, disappear. In return, I'm gonna give you the 50 % on the three million dollars. That's the deal. - And what if we refuse your stupid deal? - Donnie! In my line of business, there's no mercy for a man or woman. - All right, all right, all right. Don't, don't. We'll do it. - You got 24 hours to get my money. Let's go. Let's go, get up. And don't forget who you work for. Let's go, Poppy, come on, come on. Come on, let's go, motherfucker, let's get up, huh? - I promise-- - Come on, come on, come on. Just get outta here, go. Get her outta here! Now you stay, Flaca. You see, I told you I'm a nice guy. I tell you what's my plan. I'm gonna build a little house up there. Convenient, you see, lovely. Sexy girl. I like you. Can I kiss you? Donnie. Position 26, let's go. 26. - I know it's you. You son of a bitch. You a fucking cockroach, man. You send women against me? That's it, huh? You just a fuckin' amateur. You bring them against me? That's the best you can bring? You stupid. I tell you what. Your plan backfired on you. Because guess what? They are working for me right now. And you know what? They know I won the game. It was fair and square. You lost the money, motherfucker. Three million by tomorrow, 24 hours. If not, I'm coming to you. That's right. Talk. - Nate, I didn't do this shit! - All right, that's enough. See, stupid? All the plan you did got backfirin' on you. How many times I told you you gotta be professional, huh? You send women against me? Every fuckin' gangster know that women react over emotion. So listen to me, motherfucker. I want my three fuckin' million dollar tomorrow. And guess what, I want an interest. And maybe I'm gonna consider not to kill you. And the woman here, tell you what. I'm gonna let all my guys have some fun with her. That's right. You better be there. All right. Keep an eye on her. - Man, I can't believe this shit! - I can't believe it either. I'm just really confused. Would Nate really use us like this? I don't get it. - It sounds possible, Dixie. Like it or not, looks like your man played us all. - I just need to see him, you know? I just need to, to look at him. But if he's, I, I, if he's using us... - If he's using us, he's, if he used us, he's been using us! - But we don't know that I mean, do we really know that? - Did you see what just happened in there? - Of course I saw what happened in there. - Okay, well Jazzy is not here right now. - Listen. I feel for Jazzy just as much as you do, okay? But Carlos could be lying, too. He's not like a stand-up type of guy. He's a crazy... he's, he's a psychopath. So we don't know if he's lying or not.

Thanks for helpin' us back there, I appreciate it. - It's what I do. - Angela, people call me Angel for short. - I'm Jazzy. - Angel, Jazzy, and Dixie. So, what are you guys doin' out on the street like that? - What did it look like we were doing? Prostitutes? - Well, we always call it street employment. - Wow, that's amazing, 'cause, I mean you guys are beautiful. You could be doin' so much more. - This is all we know. I mean, we grew up in group homes and... We didn't know our biological parents. We vowed we'd stick together. We became sisters. - We had to find a way to make it on our own. - They're the only family I got. - Well hey, you know what? We're all family here. So. You guys wanna go take a shower, hang out, kick it. My place is your place, and hey, I promise you, no funny business. - Thank you. - Let me ask you another question. What if I told you I could give you job makin' way more money than you makin' now? - Depends on what it is. - As long as I don't have to fuck no men. - Doing what? - Contract killers. - Angel. Wake up, we're here. Nate? - Nate! - Honey? Nate? Nate! He's not in here. - Well maybe Carlos tipped him off that we were looking for him. - You're probably right. Doesn't make sense for him not to be here. So what the hell are we supposed to do now? - I don't know, but we're not gonna find him standing here. So let's just hit the streets and see what we can come up with. - All right. - Wait a minute. Who knows Nates' whereabouts just as much as we do? - His nephew Omar. - Right. - Doesn't he work at that uh pet store down in the valley or somethin' like that? - Yep, and that's where we're going. Let's go. Come in. Mr. Collins, what do I owe for this unexpected pleasure? - I apologize, sir, for comin' unannounced, but... I seem to be havin' a little problem collecting my winnings from the poker tournament with Carlos. I sent a team to collect and all they get is static. I don't do static very well. I mean, you were there, you saw what happened. - Hmm. Mr. Collins. If I may enlighten you, do you remember Mr. Morelli? He was also at the poker game. Well, he belongs to the Italian mob. Apparently, our Mr. Carlos Enrique owes the mob over five million dollars. - So he owes a lot of people money and he's a horrible poker player, what does that have to do with me? - A funny thing happened the other day. While I was out, Mr. Enrique's nephew, Ramon, came in here and tried to rob us. I can only presume that he wanted to make up for that lost debt. So, I can only assume that Carlos wanted to collect from you this, to pay off his mounting debts. - I'll be damned. - The weirdest thing is, word on the street is that Carlos killed his nephew for the lost money. His own nephew, can you beat that? Please. Take my advice, Mr. Collins. Tread very carefully. Our Mr. Enrique, to put it mildly, is one dangerous son of a loco. - I understand. Thanks for the information. - Oh, ladies, uh... Hi. - Can I help you with something? - We're looking for Omar. - Sure I can't help you with anything? - Actually, it's personal. We really need to talk to Omar. - He's in the back, I'll go get him. Omar! Git ya ass out here. Come on! Come on. - What, B, why you always givin' me a hard time, man? - Hey, Omar. Long time no see. - What's up? - Hi, Omar. See you're still lookin' cute as ever. - Well, you know. What can I say, ladies? So what you been up to? Just workin', that's about it. - There's nothing wrong with a paycheck. - Yep. - So Omar, we're lookin' for your uncle. Have you seen him? Talked to him? - We've been tryin' to track him down, we can't seem to find him anywhere. - Uh, I haven't spoke to Uncle Nate in like, a few days. - Really? You haven't seen him, talked to him, no? Hmm. - You're sure? - Yeah. - All right. Well, if you see him, you talk to him, give us a call? Both our numbers are on there. Cool? - All right. - Thanks, Omar. - Bye, Omar. You know what? I think Omar was lying to us. - Yeah, I got that feeling too. - Well so, what should we do? I mean, we can go back in there, rough him up a little. - What's the point of doin' that? - If he knows where Nate is and he's lyin' to us, then we need to do somethin' about it. - That's not gonna solve anything. Besides if we go in there and we hurt Omar, he's still not gonna tell us where Nate is. There's just gotta be another way. Hello? - Yo, what up, Dixie? Yeah, bitch, I hear y'all lookin' for me. - Nate? - Yeah, Nate, who the fuck you think it is? I hear you're lookin' for me, what's up? - If you really owe Carlos money, you know the rules. - What the fuck you mean, I know the rules? I made the rules, bitch. You gonna try to tell me the rules? I made the rules. Fuck Carlos, you gonna believe Carlos? Fuck Carlos and fuck you. - We need the money, Nate. They have Jazzy. - All right, lemme tell you somethin', bitch. Lemme tell you somethin' right now. You and your little fuckin' piece of shit friend. When I met you fuckers you was livin' in the street, you didn't have a pot to piss in, your fuckin' pussy stank. I cleaned your ass up. - So what do you want? A gangster cookie? You sent us out on a lie, Nate. - You think it's a lie? You think it's a lie? Lemme tell you somethin', you just made the biggest mistake of your life, you bitch. Y'all picked the wrong motherfucker. You had me on your team, you had me in the corner, and now you gonna go listen to that fucking burrito, fuckin' Taco Bell bitch over me? - You know what? It's just business, baby. It's nothing personal. - You got some motherfuckin' nerves. And guess what? It's over. - What happened? - Just Nate talkin' shit. - Well did you find out where he is? - No. Wait a minute. Didn't Carlos say that Nate keeps his, his stash of money in an old RV? He said that. - Yeah, so? I don't know where that shit is. - Well, about a year and a half ago, I remember Nate telling me that he went out with this girl, he went camping at Camp Silent Valley in Balmont. They let you store your RVs there so you don't have to take it back and forth to your home. - Well, it's worth a shot. You know what the RV looks like? - Nope. But if I know Nate, it's gonna stick out like a sore thumb. - True. Let's go then. - So how's your family, Mr. Han? - Mr. Enrique, I'd like to-- - You know this place, built by Mexicans. Four years later, they took it all. - Mr. Enrique-- - But I took it back. - There's something we've got to settle. - They built 20 tunnels, just to get out of this place. Please, let me show you. Did you know we're connected to the governor of Baja, California? Federales they are workin' under the table over there. - My God, what's going on in here? - This is part of my investment. - Your investment? Your investment now extend to kidnapping? - Mr. Han, did I tell you I can land a helicopter on my roof? We could have dinner in Sacramento tonight. We should be back in Chinatown tomorrow. Next month I'm throwing a party here, you are welcome. - Thank you. - You know, Mr. Han, it's always good to do business with you. - Likewise. - Thank you for coming. - Thank you. - Let me walk you to the door. - I'm gonna enjoy blowing your head off, you loud-mouth bitch. - Dream on, Jose. As a matter of fact, I have a prediction to make about the future. - A prediction? Go ahead. I gotta hear this. - I predict I'm gonna walk outta here without a scratch. After I beat your ass. And you won't be able to do anything about it because you'll be so busy cryin' like a bitch. - You're gonna kick my ass? Yeah, all right. I'd like to see how your little skinny, tied-up ass is gonna do that. I want you to kick my ass, come on, do it. I want you to do it, do it. Do it. - Okay. - What are you doin' on the floor? She got away. - What do you mean, she got away, where is she? - She went that way. - Where is she? Come on, get up, get up, get everybody, let's go! Hey, Jazzy. I'll be nice to you. You know I'm not gonna do nothin'. All we gotta do, is wait here for your friends to get the money, Jazzy. - Yo? Yeah. Hold on one minute here. Nate, how you doin'? - Good. - You all right? - I'm good, you look like you doin' good. - Ah, you know, I've been better, I've been worse. What's been goin' on, buddy? - I'm lookin' for Carlos. - Uh. That might be a problem, Carlos left town for a couple days, I'm not sure where he's at. - Oh really, well he ain't said nothin' to me about goin' outta town. - I'm tired. You wanna get some coffee? - Hmm. In Nate's spot? - Yep. - I could use some. - You remember the plan, my nigger? - Course, dog. - Yo, we cannot afford to fuck this up. - Rayshawn, don't even worry about it. We good, man. - Tic Tac, I'm serious, dog. - We good. I'll just get in there, lay these fools down, and get this money. I'm ready. - You ready? - Yeah, I'm ready. - All right. Let's get this money. Nigger, get rid of them Tic Tacs, dog. Focus, dog, come on, man, you ready? - Yeah, let's go. - All right. Is there a problem? - Yeah, there's a big motherfuckin' problem. - Really? - Yeah. Carlos owes me money. And I need my money. - All right. - So I want you to take him a message for me. - Okay. - Want you to tell Carlos that I'll be back. Full on. - All right. I'll, I'll give him that message. - I believe you, Kid Carl, I like you. - Okay, everything is cool. Hey, nigger, check yourself! - Ain't you niggers hot in that?

Matter of fact, bag 'em up, you already got one in the bag. - Okay, all right. - Yeah, you understood. - I'm good, don't worry, I'm not gonna do nothin'. - Man, just hurry the fuck up. - Right, I'll let Carlos know that uh-- - I don't give a fuck who Carlos is. - He came by and got us some more. - Just pack it up. - All right. - Thank you very much. Woo, I feel good, nigger. - All right. - Shut the fuck up. - All right. - Cash. - Now you got-- - Yes, oh, motherfucker! - Yeah, yeah. - We in this, motherfucker. - Not for long, dude. - We in this, motherfucker, we out.

Yo, yo. - Hey man, what the fuck are you guys bringin' me on this stupid shit for? - Yeah, why the fuck did we bring this man? - Yeah, we got caught up in some crazy shit, dog. - Ah, shit. - Why did you bring-- - We gotta split it, we gotta split it, four ways. - I wonder where they're takin' him. - Who knows. - There's gotta be some kind of explanation for all this. I don't get it. - Yeah, well it looks like your man's got more problems than just us. You know if they kill him we don't get that money, right? And if we don't get that money, Jazzy dies. - I get it, okay? But we have to do something quick, 'cause time's really running out. - Did you see those guys? How does, how does Nate get himself into this? - I don't know, but they look like, they look like amateurs. - Hold on, hold on, why the fuck are you-- hold up, hold up, why are you askin' questions? Nigger, you not in control right now, we got the keys. You sit back there, shut the fuck up. You, hold on, no, you keep your gun on him, dog. - My bad. - Keep it, don't put your gun on me, put the gun on him. - Hey. ♫ 'Cause I don't fuck ♫ With the heavy ass - Hey. - I got a question.

Are you crazy? - Of course, what do you think, we came here for nothing? - Huh? What'd you come here for, you wanna take it? You think I'm gonna give it to you? Huh, what, I give it to you so you can give to Carlos? - We need the money, Nate. Okay, Carlos has Jazzy and we need you and the body back to him. - He gave us 24 hours till Jazzy dies.
