My spirit lives in this market, enduring both sadness and joy. You see these women. They are packing their wares to go home. Today will be the last time I see them. I'm ready to come with you.

We took these from those troublesome egungun cult leaders who were arrested last month. If the juju didn't harm you then, why would it harm you now, just merely by looking at it? Madam, eh, I arrested the troublemakers [spluttering] who were causing trouble. But me, I didn't touch the egungun. I don't abuse it. I treat the egungun with respect.

"I have to report that it come to my information that one prominent chief, namely, the Elesin Oba, is to commit death tonight as a result of native custom." "Because this is criminal offense, I await further instruction at charge office. Sergeant Amusa." Did I hear you say commit death? Obviously, he means murder. Do you mean a ritual murder? Must be. Does it mean we won't go to the ball at all? No! No, no, no, no. I'll have the man arrested. Everyone remotely involved. [sighs] As the parents of the maiden that is supposed to marry my son, hmm... I'd like you to take heart. The ancestors have spoken tonight. And we have decided to give Elesin his last earthly wishes. He's getting ready to go and meet his ancestors. Your daughter will be the one to receive the seed that comes with the strength and power of his lineage. I would like us to honor it. Mother, prepare your daughter to receive Elesin. Father, hmm... let us rejoice that the will of the ancestors is done to your daughter. My Akanni, you are my firstborn, and I am your mother. I want you to look around you. All that I have is yours, even more than you can think. I want you to honor me. And let us do the will of our ancestors. Let us do it.

He will simply die. Die? Nobody just dies. [Joseph] It is native law and custom. The King died last month. Tonight is his burial. But before they bury him, the Elesin must die so as to accompany him to heaven. [chuckling] I seem to be fated to clash more often with that man than with any of the other chiefs. The so-called King's Chief Horseman. - [huffs] - Simon, what's the matter? He's that chief with whom I had a scrap some three or four years ago. I offered to get his son to medical school in England, remember? Yes, now I remember. The most sensitive young man. What was his name again? Olunde. The old pagan wanted him to stay and carry on some family tradition or the other. And then I couldn't understand the fuss he made. I literally had to help the boy escape from closed confinement and load him onto the next boat. Most intelligent boy, really bright. The most sensitive young boy, you know.

Some strange custom they have, sir. It seems because the King is dead, some important chief has to commit suicide. I sent Amusa to prevent this catastrophe. Clearly, he did not. Meanwhile, my person in charge is parading in a native costume, a winner no doubt. Now I have to inform His Royal Highness there is a riot erupting not two miles from here. Sergeant Amusa is sometimes prone to exaggerations. He sounds desperate enough. You should've kept me informed, Pilkings. I wasn't aware of the whole business until tonight, sir. Nose to the ground, Pilkings. Nose to the ground. If we let all of these little things slip past us where would the Empire be? Tell me that. Where would we all be? Sleeping peacefully at home I bet. What did you say, Pilkings? It won't happen again, sir. It mustn't, Pilkings. It mustn't. We're supposed to be a secure colony of His Majesty, Pilkings. No, these can't be our native police. Are these the ringleaders of the riot? Sir, these are my police officers. Oh. I do beg your pardon, officers. You do look a little... I say, they're missing something from their uniform. I think they used to have some rather colorful sashes. A bit of color always appeals to the natives, yes? Well, where are we? Make your report man. Let's have no more superstitious nonsense from you, Amusa. Or I'll throw you in the guardroom for a month and feed you pork. Alright. Well, you handle things, Pilkings. Whatever you do, don't let things get out of control. Keep a cool head and... nose to the ground, Pilkings. Yes, sir. [tense music plays] [bell tolls] Is that midnight? I had no idea it was that late. Alright, you two, let's go. Let's go! Goodnight, madam. Oh... Amusa. Poor Simon. [anticipatory music plays] [laughing in the distance] [slow jazz music plays] [Jane] Who is that? I didn't mean to startle you, madam. I'm looking for the district officer. [Jane] Wait a minute. [grunts] Don't I know you? Oh, yes! You are Olunde, the young man who went... Mrs. Pilkings! How fortunate. I came here to look for your husband. [excitedly] Olunde! Let's look at you. What a fine young man you've become. Grand, but solemn. Good God, when did you return? We just spoke about you earlier. How did you even get in? I came on the same voyage as the prince. You are... You look quite well, Mrs. Pilkings. - From what little I can see of you. - [chuckles] Yes, this. It's caused quite a stir, I can assure you that, and not all of it very pleasant. You're not shocked, I hope? Why should I be? But don't you find it rather hot in there? Well, it's all for a good cause. [giggles] What good cause, Mrs. Pilkings? Well, all this, the ball. And His Highness being here in person and all that. And that is the good cause for which you desecrate an ancestral mask? Oh. I see you are shocked after all. How disappointing. No, I am not shocked. You forget that I have now spent four years among your people. I discovered you have no respect for what you do not understand. Oh, so, you've returned with a chip on your shoulder. What a pity, Olunde. I'm sorry. The horseman's son I believe. Wears a suit quite well. [chuckles] Coveting youth doesn't become you, sister. [Olunde] Please, Mrs. Pilkings, do you think you could find your husband for me? I have to talk to him. Simon... There is a little problem in town that he was sent for. Why are you here? I was sent a cable that the King had died. I came to bury my father. Well, thank God you don't have to go through that agony. Simon is going to stop it. That's why I want to see him. He's wasting his time. And since he has been so helpful to me, I do not want him to incur the enmity of our people. Especially for nothing. You... Olunde, it's not nothing. It makes no sense. Yet another error into which your people fall. You believe that everything that appears to make sense was learned from you. Not so fast, Olunde. You've learned to argue, I can tell that. But your father's death is still a barbaric custom. The King dies, and a chieftain must be buried with him? How feudalistic can you get! And this? In the midst of a devastating war. Look at that. What name would you give to that? Therapy, British style. The preservation of sanity in the midst of chaos. Others would call it decadence. However, it doesn't really interest me. You whites know how to survive. Through this war I have slowly seen that your greatest art is the art of survival. But at least have the humility to let others survive their own way. Through ritual suicide? Is that worse than mass suicide? War that claims millions of lives? In your newsreels I've heard defeats, thorough, murderous defeats described as strategic victories. I know now how history is made. I have had enough time to study your people. I saw nothing, finally, that gives you the right to pass judgment on other people's ways. Nothing at all. Oh, please! Listen. You can't hear anything over that... music. - What is it? - [festive drumbeat playing in distance] The drums. [festive drumbeat playing] ♪ The elephant has fallen and can't get up It is asleep like a mountain ♪ Can you hear the drums? - Listen. - [festive drumbeat playing in distance] [marching band music plays] [festive drumbeat playing] ♪ The elephant has fallen And can't get up ♪ ♪ It is asleep like a mountain ♪ ♪ The elephant has fallen And can't get up ♪ [marching band music plays] [indistinct chatter] [crowd exclaiming] ♪ Elesin has failed us ♪ - ♪ Mm hmm mm ♪ - ♪ Elesin has failed in his duty ♪ ♪ Mm hmm mm ♪ ♪ Iyaloja warned Elesin About doing the right thing ♪ ♪ But Elesin failed in his covenant He overturned things ♪ ♪ He left our king midway ♪ ♪ Between earth and heaven ♪ ♪ What a pity ♪ ♪ Oh what a pity ♪ [forlorn music playing] There. It's all over. - Do you mean he's... - Yes, Mrs. Pilkings. My father is dead. His willpower has always been enormous. I know he is dead. How can you... be so callous. So unfeeling! You announce your own father's death like you're a surgeon looking on some... stranger's body! You're just a savage like all the rest. [tense music plays] My father has been dead in my mind for nearly a month. Ever since I learned of the King's death. I've lived with my bereavement so long I cannot think him alive. My mind is on my duties as the one who must perform the rites over my father's body. Even as he himself has taught me. I don't want to do anything wrong. Something that could jeopardize the welfare of my people. [yells] Let me go! [tense music playing] [Elesin] The clothing of shame you have put on me is enough. White man! Take your hands off me! That's my father's voice. [Jane gasps] Carry him to the cell in the garden. Ah! [grunts] Give me back my name, which you have stolen from me! You nameless pale forest ghoul. - [tense music playing] - [Elesin pants] We cannot have a disturbance here. Carry him. [yells] Leave me alone! [tense music playing] Olunde. Ah! [whimpers, pants] Child, do not let the sight of your father turn you blind. [labored breathing] I do not have a father, unprincipled man. [Elesin] Ah! Ah! [solemn music plays] [orchestra music playing] [orchestra music fades] [Mr. Pilkings] You seem fascinated by the moon. Yes, albino. Your twin up there... engages my thoughts. [Mr. Pilkings] It is a beautiful night. Is that so? Light on the leaves, peace of the night. White man, this night is not peaceful! I would have said it was. You know... quiet. [crickets chirping] Is silence the same as... peace to you? [raises voice] Can't you hear me? This night is not peaceful! White man, the world is not at peace! You have shattered what is left of the peace in the land. Hear me... there is no sleep on earth tonight. It is still a good bargain. If the world should lose one night's sleep for the sake of saving a man's life. You didn't save my life! You only destroyed my life, white man. [sucks teeth] [tense music plays] [Elesin] You stole my firstborn son away from me. You sent him to your land... to turn him into your shadow. You stole from me the child that was supposed to follow in my footsteps. And when it was my turn, you stopped me from fulfilling my destiny. Did you think well about these things? Ah! These your plans will only destroy our world. Ah! [clicks tongue] It's beyond your understanding. You don't really believe that. But listen, white man. The world is set adrift, and its inhabitants are lost. We're surrounded by nothing but emptiness. Ah! Ah! Ah. You've prevented me from my duty. But I'm very sure my son is a true first born. My mind was initially telling me, and I've been suspicious of him to be aligning with the enemies of our race. It is good to learn the secrets of one's enemies. But listen, his spirit will punish you, your offsprings, and your generations. I promise you that. [chains clattering] That kind of talk is hardly called for. If you don't want my consolation. [Elesin] I don't want it! Stop trying! As you wish. I've lost a father's place of honor. My voice is broken. [clicks tongue, sighs loudly] Ah! Before I leave you, may I ask one thing of you? I'm listening, white man. I have lived among you long enough to learn a thing or two. The elder grimly approaches heaven. You ask him to bear your greetings. Do you really think he makes the journey willingly? We're all afraid of death, and no one really wants to die. [Jane yells] Simon! Simon! What on earth... [Jane panting] [ominous music plays] [Mr. Pilkings] Chief Elesin, there's yet another person here who wants to see you. As she is not your next of kin, I don't really feel obliged to let her in. Your son has sent a message with her, so it's up to you. [Elesin] I know who it is. Hmm. The odor of my shame has gone far and wide. It needs no hunter's dog to find it. She has found the hiding place where you kept me. [sighs loudly] If you don't wanna see her, just say so and I'll send her packing. Why would I not want to see Iyaloja. There's nothing left to hide. All my shame is already laid bare. Let her in. Let her come. [tense drumbeats playing] [Mr. Pilkings] Here she is. Now, first, I want your word of honor that you will try nothing foolish. Honor? White man, do you want my word of honor? [Mr. Pilkings] I know you to be a man of honor. [Elesin] I know that you searched her before she got here. Searched her as you would never dare touch your mother. And I'll be sitting out there watching even how you blink. [raises voice] What else? Haven't you already taken all my honor? Haven't you locked it up in that desk where you have written today's report? All the honor of my people, you have taken away from them. Written in those papers of treachery, which made you master over this land. If you must bring in politics, we'll have to do it the hard way. Madam, I want you to remain along this line, and move no nearer to the cell door. Guards, if she moves beyond this point, blow your whistle. Come on, Jane. [Iyaloja] See how boldly the lizard struts before the pigeon. Whereas he'd promised us a fight with the eagle. I don't want your pity, Iyaloja. If you didn't have a message for me, you wouldn't have come. Even if it is all the curses of the world, I am ready to listen. [scoffs] I will tell the other chiefs how you showed bravery in waging war against the white man who took your side against your death. You showed bravery indeed. But only with words! All the scornful words you have, you can say them to me. I more than deserve them. Didn't I warn you? That if you want to leave a seed behind, do not leave the one that is cursed. But you refused. Who are you... to want a self-replacement when you yourself are not really ready to die? My powers deserted me. All my charms and spells were ineffective. And even my voice lacked strength when I tried to summon the powers to lead me to the other side of the immortals. You have betrayed us! We said that you are the hunter that brings all animals down. We gave you all the honor, including my son's bride. But no, you answered, "I am the hunter's dog." "The hunter's waste is what I feed on." [sucks teeth, sighs] Iyaloja, my shame is enough. You have not seen anything yet! - I brought luggage with me! - And you have delivered it! It is what you deserve! Whosoever breaks precedent, will face unknown consequences. I really pity you. [angrily] I do not need your pity! Not even the pity of world. Even I, I'm intrigued, and I need to understand. What a disgraceful sight. You are now crying foul with your pity party. "Help me, help me, I'm being pursued by an animal." It does not fool the hunter. Did I not tell you that I came with luggage? It's now on the way. ♪ It is time to depart ♪ ♪ The night is here It is time to depart ♪ ♪ The night is here ♪ ♪ It's time to head home... ♪ [Iyaloja] Elesin Oba, Let me ask you a question. Didn't they say when the banana plant dies, it replaces itself? Or in your own reasoning, it is... the banana that replaces the offspring? Iyaloja, what is the meaning of all this? I did not ask you for a translation! I asked a question. [Iyaloja] Is it the banana that replaces the offspring? [yells] Answer me! [sighs] The parent. Ah. So you know. [tuts] Some people exist... only to turn the world upside down. [yells] Elesin Oba! [guard blows whistle] Should I tell you what the gods have taken from you? - What happened? - [guard] She'd moved across the line. [Iyaloja] Ah, Elesin, look at you now. Once upon a time, no one would have dared to push Iyaloja aside with you present. He must be brave. Now, look at what you have become. I think you'd better leave. White man, you have a prince here, who came from your homeland. Tell me. When he dies, would you have left the spirit to roam the surface of the earth without having peace on earth? Would you even consider burying him here among us whom you consider subhuman? Or have you no special ceremonies for the dead in your land where you come from? But we don't make our chiefs commit suicide to keep him company! Young man! I have not come to help your understanding. This is the man whose weakened understanding holds us in your contempt. You can ask him if you wish. He knows the meaning of a king's passage because he was not born yesterday. He also knows the peril, especially to our race when our king that died, that serves as our intermediary when he waits and waits, knowing that we have betrayed him. He knows when the narrow gate was opened, and he does not wait for despicable laggards that keep smelling dogs' vomit including all the remnants from those that are far below him that is in his mouth. [grunts] He knows that he has condemned our king to wander in the void. For the enemy of our world to mock. Look, what we have asked of you is little. Let Elesin go and set our king free, so he can rest with his ancestors in peace. The messenger is nearby, on the back of the women. This is the least of all his oaths, and it is the easiest fulfilled. - ♪ It is time to depart ♪ - ♪ It is time to depart ♪ ♪ The night is here ♪ - ♪ It is time to depart ♪ - ♪ It is time to depart ♪ ♪ The night is here ♪ ♪ It's time to head home ♪ What is it, Bob? Sir, there's a group of women chanting outside. Give way and let them in. What do they look like? They're not many, and they seem quite peaceful. - Any men? - Two or three at the most. [Mr. Pilkings] Alright, let them in Bob. Warn them to control themselves. - [crickets chirping] - [women singing in the distance] [Mr. Pilkings] I hope you understand if anything happens it will be on your head. My men have orders to shoot at the first sign of trouble. Huh? You don't care that to prevent one death, you will actually kill more? What great logic of the white man. But have no fear. Your prince will sleep peacefully when he dies, and so will ours at last. Nobody would ask you any question. White man's slave, just let Elesin fulfill his oath and we will go home to pay homage to our own king. [Elesin] District officer, do not fear. I have a message to send to my king. After that, there's nothing left to fear. [Iyaloja] Olunde would have done it. The chiefs asked him to speak the words, but he said no, not while you are still alive. [scoffs] Even from the depth to which my spirit has sunk... I find some joy that I can still... - [ominous music plays] - ...perform my duty to my departed king.

[Elesin sucks teeth] There lies the courier of my king. Let me go! So I can perform what is demanded of me! You'll need to do whatever you do from inside there or not at all. - [Elesin groans angrily] - I've gone as far as I intend to with this business! I must speak secretly as my father... as my father whispered it in my ears. And that is how I want to whisper it to my son's ear. They are not words I can shout to the wind... or in the open night sky. Let me go! Simon... [yells] Don't interfere! Please. [Iyaloja] They have slain the favorite horse of the King. They have slain his dog. They have carried them from house to house to receive prayers for our King. But Elesin refused to leave. [solemn music playing] Is it too much to ask that he speaks heart to heart with the waiting courier? Elesin Oba. [solemn music plays] See how they have turned their backs on you to prevent you from your duty? [solemn music plays] Elesin Oba, I call you this for the last time. Do you remember me telling you that if you cannot come, you should send my horse to come? Has your tongue been uprooted from its root? If there's a hill that you can't climb, mount my horse so he can bring you. Once, Elesin, you had a tongue that moved like a drummer's stick. I said if you get lost, my dog will track a path to me. His feet knew the way. At last, if an evil hand holds you back, just tell my horse. I cannot wait too long. Here lies the swiftest messenger of the King. My companion, if you had followed when you should have, we won't say the dog has raced and left the master behind. Indeed. [Olohun Iyo] If you had left at the appointed time, we wouldn't now say that the horse has preceded its rider. Had you lifted your spirit, to cut the thread of life when the priest summoned, we would not now say it was your shadow that fell and took its owner's place at the feast. [scoffs] What is left? Talk to your shadow now. Speak to your shadow which must now serve in your place. [solemn music playing] [Iyaloja] Here lies your messenger Elesin. The chosen companion of the King. I can't approach him now. Please remove the covering. I will send my voice in the depth of silence. [sighs] Look. Your glory! Here lies the glory of our household and of our race. It's here on the ground. Your son could not bear to let honor depart from your lineage, so he sacrificed his life. Ah, Elesin, the son has proven to be the father. And there's nothing left but infant gums in your mouth. [Olohun Iyo] Elesin, we placed the reins of the world in your hands, yet you watched it and it spilled away. You sat with folded hands as evil strangers tilted the world and crashed it into the abyss of emptiness. Your heir has now taken your place. We are not gods to tell the future, but this young shoot has now replaced the parent. And we know that this is not the proper way. Never! Our world is tumbling down in the void of strangers, Elesin! [sighs in despair] - [ominous music plays] - [muffled yelp] [maiden gasping] Be quick! Be quick! [maiden muttering] [ominous music playing] [gate rattling] [maiden crying] Hold him. [ominous music playing] [maiden crying] Now, let us forget about the dead. And we should also forget the living. Let us turn instead to the unborn.
