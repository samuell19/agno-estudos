NEILLE: In the dream, I was holding a rope and a boat was pulling me through the water. Then somebody cut the rope. I thought I would drown. The shore was so far away. I wondered if I should give in and sink, or try and stay above water for a while. But if I tried to stay above the water, if I try, I would drown anyway, because I couldn't make it to shore. The shore was so far away. I was afraid I was going to die. It's a privilege for me to present this to Ken Stacey, football's Man of the Year. Teammate, friend, great athlete, you're one of a kind, buddy. We're going to miss you, Stace. [ALL APPLAUDING] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] -LEN: Simon, Simon. -Hey, man. Great evening. Great evening, really. You know my associate, Mark Karyn? -Hi, Mark. -And of course, Nora. -Nora. -Hi, buddy. -And this must be... -Warren Styles Julie. LEN: Mr. Warren Styles, first round draft Dallas. Of course. JULIE: Pleased to meet you. LEN: Julie, my pleasure. LEN: So, what happened in the Super bowl, Simon? Not a clan on the roster. -It was a disastrous wipeout. -Maybe Warren will change that. Neille, this is Simon Banesh, friend, colleague and a great attorney. -Hello. -Hello. -Hello. -Hello. Hello. My mother will be right with you. I'm Molly and she's Megan. I'm Simon. SIMON: I love athletes. I love these guys. A lot of people think football is trivial, it's not. Players get hurt. Kind of moving them into a system where a guy like Kenny Stagey can wind up with no cartilage in his knees? That'll be with him the rest of his life. You're a beautiful woman. Thank you. Did you leave something back there? -Why? -You do that a lot. I do? -Yeah, that. -[CHUCKLES] Is Leonard good friend of yours? Yes. -More than Nora? -Yes. Is he a special friend? No. This is pretty much it. You get what you see. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] I'm never sure you're going to be here. You're not? Why? -I think you will reconsider. -Oh... [NEILLE MOANING] SIMON: Stay with me. Stay with me. -Stay with me. -[MOANING] Marry me. I'll make you incredibly happy. I've never said that to another lady, so... Fact is, I can't think of life without you anymore. Look, you want to give me some help here. Yes. -Yes, what? -I want to give you some help. Careful how you tread. -Okay. -Okay? Okay. Yes. Okay. Fantastic. -Congratulations. -Oh, well, thank you. [CHUCKLES] That is not what I meant. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] Champagne. Everything all right? No more? No? Leonard, I know you will have some. Excellent. NEILLE: Already out. There you are. Not much left. [GIGGLES] You missed. Try again. NEILLE: Simon? Thank you all for being here. You're our closest and dearest friends. Oh, yeah. -Hear, hear. -Hear, hear. Thank you for an extraordinary two years. Oh, hear, hear. -Hear, hear. -[NEILLE CHUCKLING] LEONARD: I guess nothing succeeds so much in love as absence. NORA: Never mind, Simon. It's pure envy. No, Simon is gone an aggregate of five months a year. Am I right? -Well, but what's left is choice? -Uh-huh. Quality time, Leonard. Well, do I get a mention for making the match? Hey, bedtime. Uh, you too. -Good night, baby. -Good night. -MOLLY: Good night, everybody. -Good night. Hey, wait. Something you needed, Mrs. Banesh? Uh-uh. No, the girls like to come every so often and walk through rooms. -Don't let them terrorize you. -I won't. NEILLE: That's not funny. Come down, down carefully. It's my room. MAN: The commissioner is about to receive the Jets selection and in a couple of seconds, we'll find out who is the third pick here in the first round. Time for one final... -Hi. -Grandma. -Hi, Rae. -Hi. Have they eaten? -Uh, well... -Are you hungry? -Uh, no. -Well, then go wait, you wait in there. Hi. How are you? MAN: Tim Colson, the dominant Tackle out of USC trying to... That was great. But regarded as a weak offensive line. Uh-huh. Well, it's time to find out if you are right because the pick is up and the commissioner has the card and we are ready to select... MAN: Be open to what I think. -Hope can still change their minds. -There it is. California Tackle's Tim Colson. Yes! [ALL CHEERING] There you go, man. That quarterback's going to be the happiest guy in the world. -[PHONE RINGING] -SIMON: Okay. Brown gets $2.7 million, Sharp gets... -2.4. -2.4. I know Tim Colson is not a wide receiver, but why should a player who gets picked right above my guy make $400,000 more? I'll tell you what, why don't we put an extra 50 in the fourth year and we'll call it a bonus for a point in training camp? Steve, your offensive line gave it more sacks last year than any other team in the league. [SIGHS] I know you guys are relentlessly committed to the bottom line. -What did they give Erwin? -1.875. You gave Erwin 1.875. If we're talking about 1.825, we're in the right ballpark. I don't want a no-cut contract. Because he's one of the most successful wrestlers in UCLA history. I want after-tax spendable dollars in his pocket. The boy wants to know he's going to play. No, listen, I'm right here. Bye-bye. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] Hmm. -Are you done? -Done. -Everything, everyone? -Everything, everyone. -And the help department didn't close again. -No. So, can I take you home tonight then? Please. Hey, Simon. -Done? -Oh, I just did that. So, how many hours of sleep have you averaged this past month? Beth's barely been home. -God, I'm bone-tired. -Hmm. How are the girls? Glad you're coming home, happy to be out of school, thrilled about the new house. I want a child with you. I love you beyond imagination. I've never for a single solitary moment stopped loving you. -[GROANS] -[MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO] Neille, forgive me. I don't know... I don't know how it happened. I don't want to hear a confession. It's killing me. I can't live with it. What? You can't live with that? It's done. It's over. It's done. Done? Is it, is it done? Barry and I sharing the revelation at the same time? Or could Beth not live with it? So now Barry and I get to live with it. [HORN HONKS] [MUSIC STOPS] I'm lost. Um... Did you just solve something? We all right now that I know? Do we go through something? What, are we cleansed? Or what do you want from me? I don't know. I want us to survive because... Molly's in love with you. She cries herself to sleep at night. I need us to survive this. Molly cries, you cry? Did Beth cry? Oh, yeah, well, of course she cried. It's all so sad. I need us to survive this, too okay? God, I hate you for telling me. [DIALING] ANSWERING MACHINE: This is Dr. Gabriella Miller. I'm sorry I can't take your call right now, but please leave a message and I will get back to you as soon as I'm able. -Thank you. -[BEEP] Girls, just let him sleep. Is something wrong? Uh, did we do something? No, no. No, you haven't done anything. -[SIGHS] -You're early. So are you. Nat's bringing the chromola. -That good, huh? -Yup. -Can I help? -No, thanks all the same. Call came in yesterday, Mrs. Banesh, right up your alley. Do it in your sleep. Well, sure, fine. Shall I leave you alone? Yeah. Yes. KOBE: When did you get so good? Where was I? See, the red needs to be more intense on the right. Right, right there. And it's too orange. You know, the whole thing is just too orange. -You've got it. -Great. We got it Tuesday? -Come on, Neille. -No, come on, Nat. -Let me see what I can do. -Just do on Tuesday. Thank you, Nat. Oh, thank you, Nat. You want to take the rest of the day? No, I want you to take the rest of the day? [PHONE RINGING] Yeah. It's Simon. Hi. Yes, I'm fine. Yes, I want that too. Don't anymore. Simon, I'm not your client, I'm your wife. I'm sorry, Simon, I'm working. I know. Simon, I have to go. Simon, I have to go, really. -Friday. -Friday without fail. You look like your mother or what? Or what? I adore you, Simon. ANSWERING MACHINE: Hi, Chief. It's Barry. Wanted to know if you're hanging in there, if you need any ear, friend, friendly ear... -[BEEP] -BETH: Neille, it's Beth. I'd like to think that we could talk. Oh! Beth... [BEEP] LEN: Neille, it's Len. Hi. Give me a call when you get a chance. Thanks. Bye. We're going to Lanie's. We told you. Well, all right, yes. You told me. Are you all right? Yes, I'm all right. Why don't you just go on? We'll be back early. Hmm. Well, I'll walk you to the door. [CAR DOOR CLOSES] I found you, I don't believe it. Hey, I knew you when you were, I don't know, yay high. Glad to see me? -I'm a friend of your mothers. -Oh, yeah. This is Faye. You're Molly and you're Megan and you still look like your mother. -Hi. -Hello. I didn't see you a whole lot. You were away at school, but I kept tabs on you. It would be terrible if this were real bad time for you. No, no. I'm surprised, that's all. -We got to go, okay? -NEILLE: Yeah. You just go on. -Nice to meet you. -Yeah. It's great. -Was this a bad idea? -No. Took a whole lot of networking to find you. -It was meant to. -I called Karen and Karen called Lillian, on and on. I landed I came straight out to you. I didn't call because you're unlisted. Yeah. That's... Well, I'm out of it. I sold my book and said goodbye to it. I was going nowhere, you know? I was feeling real bad about myself. I had some real bad experiences with some of the jobs, you know, ugly stuff. It was time, you know? God! You're so talented, Neille. -And I was taking class. -Yeah? Professional class taker. I was really good. I'm really good. Very intimate talent. Best suited for the screen. All these guys saying, "Come out to the post. Come out to the post", it was time I bit the bullet. One thing, you make a lot of good friends. Johns flat out, makes your best friends. I got the names of some agents. I started stashing away. I haven't done coke in, God, six months. There had to be something there because if you're really, really happy, you don't get into that stuff. Haven't done coke, haven't done anything. Every penny went into the kitty. Is he nice? Of course, he's nice. I mean, he's nice, right? -What's he do? -A sports agent. -Lawyer, right? -Right. Well, look at this. Look at you! FAYE: Such a pretty place. You got lucky, huh? Good for you. You know what? It really stops messing you up after a while. I mean, to go around with my face and the side of arm numb is not healthy. My chiropractor says I'm taking a whole bunch of other people's energy in here, so... So I'm not running my own energy. I'm running George's or Bob's or Sam's... Get this, he said, "What you are doing is very intimate work." [CHUCKLING] I started laughing. I have never thought of it as intimate before. It's scary because you know it's such quick money. I mean, it's hard when you know you're worth $300 an hour, no taxes, whenever you feel like it. Remember Hattie? She got out of the business three years ago, got right into real estate. Last year she made, like, $250,000, so it can happen, you know? You miss it? You don't miss it, do you? FAYE: Thank you, thank you very much. I love to do that, I used to love to play with my mother's hair. You're up? Mmm, yeah. I'm up. Um, you're going to the beach today? FAYE: This had nothing to do with the business. He sold hot clothes, designer clothes, that are really good deal, and jewelry. This was horrible. So I bought these clothes from him and I started to walk out and he says, "Wait a minute," and he bolts the door. He says, "I had a big rock on this table. Where is it?" I said, "You sat there when you smoked it." He says, "No, I didn't." He goes, "You lying whore." I said, "You sat there and you smoked it." He took out a .38 and he pistol-whipped me. This has nothing to do with me seeing a client. This guy wasn't a client I was his client, but I didn't get a concussion so I guess I have a hard head. [SLAMS DOOR] You got any fours? Uh, no. Go fish. [LAUGHING] Look at you. -You got any six's? -Go fish. [CHUCKLING] Got any fours? -[PHONE RINGING] -Oh, meany. Here. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] Hello? It's Megan, who's this? Just a moment. It's for you. I'll take it inside, okay? Why don't you take it in my room? Okay, sure. Thanks. Okay, girls. Uh, time for bed. I appreciate it. Yes. We're great friends, yes. Bye. Sorry. It's not what you're thinking. This is my home, you know? My children live here. You're doing business on the phone? What's the matter with you? What? Are you an idiot? It's not what you think. He's a contact. He's not a trick. -This is my home. -Come on, Neille. You're nobody to this guy. It's, it's just a phone number. What, do you not get it or what? He's not trade, Neille. Why? Is he a priest? They're all trade. Come on, Neille. -I swear, Neille. -Just a contact. From some guy I trust. I trust to say nothing. I got to take it one step at a time. Hey, don't be angry with me. I would never mess things up for you. Not for the world. It's okay. Oh, it's okay. I'm not angry. I think I outlived my welcome. -No, it's been great you're here. -No, I think I overstayed. You got to get back to your life. -Friends, huh? -Well, yeah, sure. -Of course. -I'll call when I get settled. -You don't have to go, Faye. -Yeah, I do. This has been great. I was stupid with the phone. I'm sorry. You can't really think that. Not anymore. That they're all trade? No. No, not anymore. -Thank you for coming all the way here. -Hmm. So, how are you, Len? You care for a drink? Dewar's on the rocks. No, thank you. -Do you want to look at that? -No, you'll order. -So, how are the children? -Nice. So, Simon is up holding some wide receiver's hand? Uh, yes, something like that. I knew about that. And I knew he'd tell you because that's just who he is, his tragic flaw. So now I want to know what I can do for you. -Like what? -Like anything you need. -Like what? -Well, I'm here for you. -To do what? -I'm a good friend, Neille. I know who you are. I think you need to trust me. Not sex, no. But you trust me. -Are you going to leave him? -No. I'm glad. -You are? -Yes, yes. Genuinely. Have you a genuine bone in your body, Len? Oh, you wound me. You got me in your back pocket. Anytime you need me, Neille. All right. Do you remember that little Arabia story, where the wife makes her husband cover her with lira before she'll make love to him? Is that your fantasy, Len? Among the many. -Oh, nice. -Hmm. -Champagne? -No, but you go ahead. Oh, I'm disappointed. You don't drink anymore. Not when I work. I think I'm going to leave that one just to bypass me. Oh. LEN: Don't take it off. [SIGHS] -You'd be amazed how often I thought about you. -Yeah? How much I want to make love to you. Mmm. -I do have some leverage, you know? -You do have. No John's flat out, make the best friends. -You want to forget this? -You're done, Len. Are you serious? You expect me to pay you? Why would that change? And why would that be different now? I don't believe this. I'll see you, Len. Where are you going? Where are you going? I'll see you, Len. I don't care about the money. NEILLE: Oh. Oh, God. Oh, yeah, that one. Oh, yeah, that one. [MOANING] NEILLE: Oh, Len... [SIGHS] God, I love to look at you. Love the way you move. -Hi. -Where were you? -Where were you? -Patsy, hi. Sorry, I'm late. Sorry, I'm late. -There's a bunch of calls. -Yes? Here. Simon called. -There. Sure. -Thank you, Mrs. Banesh. -I'll see you guys. Bye. -Bye. Well, do I get a kiss or what? We're too old to have sitters anymore. It's embarrassing. -Okay. You're mad at me. -MEGAN: Not me. -We're too old for sitters. -Hmm? Well, we'll talk about it later. -A contractor called. -Yes? -The archi... -NEILLE: The? -The architect. Yeah. -[SLOWLY] Architect. Architect. -Kobe called, "Where are you?" -Mmm-hmm. -Barry called. -Simon called. -You know, I heard you. -You can't reach him. He was flying to Philadelphia. Then he'll call back. Where were you? You call. You always call. Well, I went into Los Angeles to have lunch with a friend of your Dad's and I hit traffic. I need a hug. Oh. -And Grandma called. -Ooh, Grandma? Wow. I was in Los Angeles. I was having a lunch with Leonard. I got caught in traffic. I don't know why she got so uptight. She's 13 and having a sitter insults her. SIMON: Len just invited you to lunch? Mmm-hmm. Just like that. -Are you telling me something? -NEILLE: No. Are we in bad trouble? You can't ask me those questions right now, Simon. -Don't throw this away. -No. I love you. NEILLE: Please, Simon. Bye. [DIAL TONE] ANSWERING MACHINE: This is Dr. Gabriella Miller. I'm sorry I can't take your call right now, but please leave a message and I will get back to you -as soon as I'm able. Thank you. -[BEEP] This is Neille Dornen. Please call, please... Call. I need... I... I need to talk with you. Please call, all right? [PHONE RINGING] -Hello? -GABRIELLA: Neille? It's Gabriella. Can you talk with me? I'm scared. I'm really scared. I can hear that. But you're going to have catch me. You're gonna have to hang on to me because I'm... I'm losing touch. I'm getting lost. My kids are here. Neille, I have a patient now. I'll have to call... [SOBBING] Oh, God. Don't hang up. Please, don't hang up. What's happened? I don't know. I don't know. It's all back. I just... -Talk to me! -Neille... Neille, I'll call you back as soon as I have a block of time. Oh, I don't know if I'll be able to wait. I'll call you back today. Yes. All right. At 9:00, your time. No, I can't. I can't wait. Neille, I can give you the number of someone out there you can see. No, I can't, I can't do it all over again. I can't start all over again. Neille. Neille? I'm not doing too good. I hear how frightened you are. Don't go away. It's been a long time. You survived for a while by getting rid of a part of yourself, then suddenly it's coming back at you full blow. Well, just make it stop. It must feel like it's all coming apart. That must be very, very scary. -Oh, God! -[DOOR OPENS] Close the door, go back to bed! Close the door. Neille? I will call you back at 9:00 your time. Close the door. What's happening? I'm just... Please go back to bed. It's all right. It's going to be all right. [DOOR CLOSES] Come on in. I won't shoot you. I don't have a gun. I don't remember. Did you quit or are you fired? Whichever you say. Stop leaving messages. I gave up leaving messages. Shame on you. I'm sorry. "Sorry" don't cut it, Neille. We got a panic client out there waiting for comps. What, old Spanish days. I sold the job on hand-tinted archival photos. Marsh can do it with his eyes tied behind his back. I have a copyright releases. I don't care. Look, it's your job. Do what you want with it. Just don't loss me up anymore. I'll call him. So, temporary lapse we got here or what? I don't know. Don't count on me. [PHONE RINGING] MOLLY ON ANSWERING MACHINE: This is the Banesh's. We're not here to take your call right now, but if you'll leave your name and number, we'll call you back as soon as we can. [BEEP] GABRIELLA: This is Gabriella. I am returning Neille's call. Come on in. I got someone here. Last minute, 300 bucks. -Come on in. -Uh, no. I'll come back later. No, no. He's in the shower. I share it with another girl. It's okay, huh? -A lot of bucks. -[PHONE RINGING] What do you think? He brought these with him. [ANSWERING MACHINE BEEPS] MAN: This is for Laurel. It's, if... I'm sorry. I was hoping we could do lunch and a movie or something. That's Lillian's number. It took so long because she's in Florida, in the Keys. Thanks a million. Listen, I don't want you think that... No, I don't think anything. This is not who I am anymore. I miss the money. This is something I know how to do. -Something to fall back on. -Yeah. But once the work starts coming in, I'm going to kiss it goodbye. It used to be scotch and vodka. Some Bourbon, then it went to red wine, then white wine. Out here it's all mineral water and diet soda -and whatever's fresh squeezed. -[CHUCKLES] -It's funny, huh? -Yeah. Now, with AIDS and everything, it's all changed. [DOOR CLOSES] I've been with some very big movie actors. They're okay. One was very nice. The rest are pretty much about themselves. Now, I'm getting past the age for them anyhow, which is just fine by me. They're more the 20-year-old airheads. I'm there. Thanks a million. -You're looking for a place? -A book. Well, Lillian would know. That's what I thought. Don't be a stranger. Oh, just take care of yourself. Always. I always take care of number one. JERI: It's a good book. And you're getting a small gold mine. And I get a lot of client-to-client referrals. These men want someone a little older, someone who can talk. They're all regulars. You can set your watch by it. It's all straight forward. Nothing kinky. Roger likes to clean house, wants a lot of verbal abuse so I made notes on them specials. Oh, there is one couple that's pretty bizarre. They're, uh, well you can refer them on if you like. It's just... I've known them for a very long time. They're very funny, very rich. Little old people who come through L.A. once or twice a year. Thank you. No, thank you. You and Lillian old friends? Yes, we work together. Well, she said you're very, very good. Yes, I am very good. I need you a 3:00 at the Charlestown. Do you want it? That's terrific. Fine. I just sold you 20 years of my life. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] [ELEVATOR DOOR CLOSES] [ELEVATOR BELL DINGS] -I'm playing tonight. -Oh. -And please sit down. -Hmm. Oh, would you like some champagne? No, thank you, but, um, you go ahead. Do you know who I am? Well, yes, of course I do. I've heard you play. Your name isn't Bree. -No. -It's not a name. Bridgett. Have you been with anyone else today? Yes. Take off your clothes. I want so much to be with you right now. This is very special. Why don't we get business out of the way so we don't have to think about it anymore? -Hello? -Hello. Did you know you're having dinner at Norbert's at 8:30 with Kobe and Alice? And Simon's coming straight from the office so he'll meet you there, for your birthday. -Which is not until? -Not our time with you. -It's cats and dogs out there. -I know, tons. And do you know who wants to have you for a few weeks? -I'm not going. -Who? Where? -Your grandmother, your grandparents. -MOLLY: I don't wanna go. -I do. -And you with us? -Not this trip. -We aren't going. Why not? I can go. Why can't I go? And they haven't seen you in an age. You'll have a great time. -They'll spoil you rotten. -You spoil us rotten. -I certainly do not. -You try and buy us. That is unfair. She doesn't. How can you want to send us away? MEGAN: She doesn't want to send you away. I don't want to send you away. Don't we get to talk about this? I mean, are we supposed to talk about this? We were talking about it, I don't wanna send you away. I never think it, never think it. You don't have to go. It's an invitation, we'll all just beg off, okay? LEN: So the team wants to establish the paradigm of the sleezoid, greedy agent, but your basic pimp is do you know what your son does for a living. So Simon turns the paradigm on its head. Altruistic, ethical attorney, compassionate, role model athlete. Hmm. -Praise to the face. -Is an open disgrace. -Well, um, today at the hairdressers. -LEN: An anecdote? -Mmm-mmm, this is a fable. -A fable. The woman who was sitting in the next chair, she says to Guy or Claude, or whatever his name is, "My husband forgot to leave me cash today. "Well, that's gonna cost him $1,000 "because I'm gonna go shopping." [CHUCKLING] The game is always played the same. No matter how it starts off, love, it always ends up a trade-off, with one side trying to maintain an advantage over another. Well, that's, present company accepted... Didn't I say that? Happy Birthday, happy birthday to my beautiful, patient, enigmatic wife. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, thank you. -Happy birthday, dear. -NEILLE: Thank you all for coming. You are my closest and dearest friends. And when you feel valued, you feel loved and I am valued. -Hear, hear. -And you're loved. Hear, hear. [KOBE LAUGHS] So, Kobe, are you two snowed under with work? I don't know, well, I'll let you feel that one, Neille. Well, there's always too much and never enough. Is that fair to say? KOBE: That's fair to say. -Thank you for my party. -My pleasure. [THUNDER RUMBLES] You want some help with that? I want you to come with me. Well, I can't I'm sorry, I have to stay with the girls. I thought they were going over to your mother's? -No, they don't want to. -Why? Well, it's Molly, really. She needs what she needs right now. What does that mean? She needs to be home. What do you need? What I have. I mean, it's not like it's a piece of cake with my parents. Oh, come on. They're nuts about those kids. NEILLE: Don't get them confused with your parents, Simon. Mine are still trying to get it right. But they like you, you're always quite the catch, you know, a feather in my cap. Even my father will feel better about himself. What was that going on between you and Kobe? Oh, you know, Kobe. No. I don't really know Kobe. -I'm not there anymore. -What? -I'm taking some time off. -How long ago was this? I don't know, a few weeks ago. And you didn't think it was important to tell me? I didn't think so, no. Oh, this ground is feeling really slippery to me. Simon, look, I told you now. So let's not make a thing of it. What do you do with your time? I don't know, I fill it. I don't care what you do, you can do what you want. I don't care what you do. I can afford to take care of my family, that's not the point. I'm sorry, I didn't tell you. We do talk every so often. Well, not so much the past month. -Whose fault is that? -Mine, my fault. I can't be guilty forever, Neille. What do you want to know, Simon? Nothing. My God, we don't even know how to fight. MAN OVER ANSWERING MACHINE: Hello, Bree? My lunch was canceled tomorrow. I wonder if we can get together at, say, noon? I know its last minute. Give me a call. Let me see you. Let me see you. -Thanks. -Yeah. Uh... Davies Truin, he says a lot of good stuff about you. He says a lot of good stuff about you too. Well, he's a great wide receiver, fantastic athlete. I guess he was two years ahead of me at Michigan. SIMON: So people starting to crawl all over you, huh? Oh, yeah, man. You get a little rep and all of a sudden they're coming out of the woodwork. Well, when you get nominated for the Heisman Trophy, that stuff's gonna happen. You play your senior year like you did the last two, you're gonna be the first round draft choice. These guys are gonna want you in their pocket. Your life's gonna turn upside down. Davies says I should give you a call. He says that if I'm the best, I should have the best. Well, Davies has a way with words then. GIRL: Thank you, Mrs. Banesh. NEILLE: Oh, you're welcome. Grace will pick you up after school. My mother's picking us up. -Well, Grace would be at the house. -Okay. -You nervous? -No. It's all going too fast for me. -How? -I don't know. I have forgotten so much. And I'll never have it back. I liked being little girl. I liked wanting to marry Simon. Hug me. Oh... -Mommy? -Mmm? I don't always feel safe. [GIRLS SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] GIRL: I feel pretty, so let's go. [GIRLS SINGING] [GIRLS LAUGHING] [GIRLS SINGING INDISTINCTLY] Excuse me. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] VIVIAN: Was that one or two sugars? NEILLE: Uh, no sugars. It's not mandatory, you know, that you do the cocaine. -Jeri never did, but we like to provide it. -[COUGHING] -Are you all right? -He's fine. Aren't you, dear? Yes. Frances always thought Jeri was the best. -We travel. Rome, London, Tangier. -Tangier was good. Yes. But Frances always thought Jeri was the best. -Tangier was good. -Yes. Doesn't she look like Elena? Elena is our daughter. -Not really. -Oh, but there's something. Look. Look. This is Elena, and these are my grandchildren. A handsome family, don't you think? Shall we get business out of the way? We shall like to keep you for the afternoon. First, we take a hot tub and then we come back inside, gag Frances, then tie him to the bed. -NEILLE: What do you do? -Well, I watch. FRANCES: She's a screamer, my Vivian. Couch detective came closed us down one night, remember, Viv? Yeah. Oh, you're going to disappoint us, aren't you? -Yes, I'm afraid, so. -Oh. Well, do you think you can reach Charlie for us, she'd come sometimes with Jeri and party with us. Yes, I will, I'll try. -Is she leaving? -Yes, Frances. -What's gonna happen? -She's going to try to find Charlie for us. [DOOR CLOSES] I remember Charlie. Charlie was good. [ANSWERING MACHINE BEEPS] HEIDI: Bree, it's Heidi. Can you get to the Waterton at 3:00? I really need the favor, say yes. Jeans and a t-shirt. [DOOR OPENS] -NEILLE: I'm Bree. -I'm Larry, come on in. -Sit down, you want a drink? -No, thanks. -So, you're from out here? -Yes. -Really out here? -No. Take off your hat. I thought you'd be younger. No, I'm not. You know, I'd feel much happier if you take a drink. Listen, uh... You know, I just... Let's just forget this. -No problem. -Why would I want to forget? Well, I guess you're all coked up, you've been drinking and not a whole lot's gonna happen. Let's give it a shot. And I'm not what you're looking for. I think you're great. Okay, sure. The $300 is on the table. Don't touch the money! -I'd like to get business out... -Don't touch it. You're gonna get your money. But I don't want the money, I don't want the gig. Let's call it a wash. And you don't want trouble. Go on. Give me some trouble. I own you for an hour. [ANSWERING MACHINE BEEPS] MAN: Hi, Bree. It's Len Sellers, give me a call when you get a moment. Thanks, bye. Mmm. [SNIFFS] Oh... [SIGHS] Faye, it's Neille. I was beaten up by a John. Can you take my calls for a few days? Mmm. SIMON: Where were you? NEILLE: Oh... Oh, I'm sorry, I fell asleep. -Where were you? -I was at Faye's and I fell asleep. Well, we don't have to talk in the dark. When are you going away again? [SCOFFS] What? I don't think I'm ready for this conversation. I like to sleep on it because we're in trouble, Simon, you know, we're in serious, serious trouble. And, um, I need a clear head for that. What is it, Neille? I don't think I'd be much good to you tonight. Where were you? It's a simple question. I was asleep, it's a simple answer. You got two kids here. They're your kids. Nobody seems to know where to find you. Well, you know, you're right about that. No contest. I'm on your side. -Is it somebody else? -No. -Is that the truth? -Yes, I... Simon, I need to go to bed. Have you been with Len? No. Anytime, have you made love with Len anytime? No. You're not sure. I had to give it some thought. Why is that? Let me go to bed, Simon. Hey, you owe me. You owe me somehow. I owe everything, Simon. Just everything. Owe you! I owe you everything. You want to know if I've been with Leonard? Yes, I have been, Leonard. Wanna know if I've had sex with Leonard? Yes, I had sex with Leonard. I will probably have sex with Leonard next week because I am a whore, Simon. -[GRUNTS] -No, pay attention. Pay attention to this. No, listen you wanted to get in to this. Don't get hang up on Leonard. Leonard is just another John. I'm a hooker, Simon, I'm a working girl. I sell my body, money for services, on call, I'm a whore, Simon. I am a whore. And I just got punched out by a client tonight and I hurt. [CRYING] And I'm sorry. Oh, Simon. I'm so sorry. Megan? Dad, it's Neille. Let me talk to Mom. I know what time it is. No, don't hang up. Just wake her. She'll be up in half an hour anyway. Wake her, damn it! -[SIGHS] -[CAR ENGINE TURNS OVER] Ma, hi, um... I want you to come out for a few weeks, okay? [CAR DEPARTING] No, just do it. To some time with your grandchildren. You say you always want to spend time with your grandchildren. Ma, I need you to come out here, just you. He'll survive. When was the last time I ever asked you for anything? Yeah, I'm in trouble. Ma? [SIGHS] Ma, I... I'm sending the ticket, okay? I'm sending it, Ma. You don't need to make arrangements just get on the plane, okay? [SIGHS] [ENGINE TURNS OVER] [INDISTINCT TALKING] [INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENT OVER P.A.] NEILLE: Well, thanks a bunch. No, I didn't give you a chance. I didn't let you say no. Yeah. Yes, I do understand. It's all right, Ma. I... It's all right, Mother. MAN: What are you doing? You're not supposed to do that. I don't want you to do that. [BANGING] [GROANING] [SOBBING] This is beautiful, very, very classy. When could I have it? NEILLE: Your convenience. -Just one bedroom? -Yes. -Where do you sleep? -I sleep at home. I don't know how Charlie does it. Charlie's only got one bedroom. A house set for her. I couldn't sleep in there. It was too crowded. Too many entities. Today we were going through the cleaning out of shockers and stuff and my counselor told me I had to limit the sex partners to five a week. I had this one guy that I just talk to him. I have to pretend he's the pizza delivery man and I'm the housewife. Or, he's the furniture guy and I don't know how I'm gonna make the payment on my sofa. He's the saddest, sweetest guy. [KNOCK ON DOOR] -Hi. -Hello. -Well, come on in, Leonard. -Oh. Hmm. You want something to drink? [SIGHS] Some white wine is fine. -I have Champagne. -Oh, that's better. NEILLE: How did you find this number? Well, that's my little secret. It's so easy, Neille. Cheers. I'm giving it up. Oh, again? Starting with you. I don't know what to say. NEILLE: You don't have to say anything. Well, I'm mildly ticked off. I wanted to see you, I wanted you to know that Simon knows. -Simon knows what? -About this, about you. -How? -It came up. Oh, it just came up? No, he asked me, Len. He asked me specifically about you. And you told him that we had an affair. No, we never had an affair, Leonard. For God's sake, Neille. I mean... [CHUCKLES] The man is my best friend. I mean, I kept the confidence. I never betrayed your confidence. -You're a good lawyer. -I didn't deserve that. You're a saint. Has he left you? I think so, yes. You know, you burned your bridges, fine, but you did not have permission to burn mine. What, how would you do that to me? What earthly purpose did it serve? It had nothing to do with you, Len. -I'm sorry if you're upset. -Are you? I don't think so, I don't think you give a damn. The man was my friend. He is my husband. [DOOR CLOSES] [FAUCET RUNNING] NEILLE: Take care. Have a safer trip, Faye. -Which one are you? -MOLLY: Molly. Warm. NEILLE: In the dream, I was holding a rope and a boat was pulling me through the water. Then somebody cut the rope. I thought I would drown. If I try to stay above water, if I try, I would drown anyway. The shore was so far away. I was afraid I was going to die. -I'm not going to die. -No. I used to think he wished me dead. Who? I could disappear in front of his eyes. There was no excuse for me, for my sister, for me. We ended the line, we were proof of failure. We were lousy trophies. We were children. -That was very confusing. -I would imagine. It's very sad you had to take that on. You know what I did with the money? I sent it to my father. Envelopes full of cash, no note, no return address. I know they're piled in the back of a drawer somewhere. Back out of sight. He'll never touch them. You enjoy that? Hmm. Being little kid, huh? Got some of my own back. Not nice. Nice? What kind of word is that? -Hi. -Hi. Kobe's not here right now. Do you want to wait? He's with a client. I'm Tracy. -I'm Neille Banesh. -[CHUCKLES] I know who you are. Do you want to wait? He was due back at 10:30, I guess they ran over. -I don't think so. -Well, why don't you try back at 2:00? -He has to be back at 2:00. -Maybe I'll do that. TRACY: I'm a big fan of your work. -I've seen a lot of your work. -Well, thank you. It's okay. The art's great. -[PHONE RINGING] -Mmm. -I thought you're coming back at 2:00. -I said, I might. -That was a week ago, Monday. -Mmm-hmm. [SIGHS] Uh... Come on over here. Let me take a look at you. You've lost weight. -Oh, no, gained some. -[KOBE CHUCKLES] What do you think of Tracy? -NEILLE: Well, she's got great taste. -[CHUCKLES] -She likes your work. -Well... -Oh, she told you. -Yes. [LAUGHS] Well, it's good. It's good work. I decided I'm getting too old to do my own grunt work. -Tracy is doing all the production. -Oh. What I'm saying... She hasn't replaced you. Well, I hoped, I Hoped that you were overloaded with work. [LAUGHS] I pray for too much work. I hoped you had something you wanted to farm out. I love you, but I can't trust you. Once, shame on you. Twice, shame on me. Okay. -Alice had the baby. -Sorry, I meant to ask. Yeah, little girl. October the 15th, Sylvie, yeah. -How's Alice? -Ah, she's great. She is a great woman. And Simon? Simon is well. I think Simon is well. -Away? -Way away. Really away. -Permanently? -I think pretty permanently. Well, always good to see you. Neille, I'm not going to throw you any bones. You wanna come back to work, just come out and say it. I'd never turn you away. Not my nature. When I was working, sometimes right after, only sometimes, it felt, sometimes... I felt I was in the eye of the storm. And what was that like? A state of grace... Sacrilege. It was never about sex. I never felt... Yes? Is that true? Yes, um... -No, control. -Control? That exacts such a price, to feel in control. No, to be in control. You control the sex, you control the Johns, you control the beating. Is that what you're saying? -No, you can't understand. -Perhaps not. I'm trying to understand if that's what you believe. You felt in control, very big and in control. What you were hiding is that scared child. That wounded child. That's what needs mending, who needs healing. She can't control anything. Do you know she isn't hateful? She isn't worthless? Oh, I know. I know. Bye, Grandma. Bye, Rae. All right. Hi. -Hi. -Hi. Surprise. Well, they're still grandparents at the moment. -It's really, really good to see you two. -Thanks. It's good to see you. All right, why don't you two go wait in the car, okay? Just wait in the car. When are you coming back home? He's not coming back home. -What did we do? -Wait in the car, okay? [CAR DOOR CLOSES] -Sorry. -Why? -Rotten timing. -Oh. So, what... What's happening in your life? I'm getting well, getting better. I didn't know you were ill. I'm back with Kobe. Oh, good. They had a girl, Sylvie. Number five. [SIGHS] Faye is dead. Oh, I'm sorry. How? Well, nobody knows really. She was doing drugs. She fell into a sink, she drowned. Absurd, absurd way to die. Alone and absurd. But that was Faye all over. Right. Uh, I can't bear to look at you. It breaks my heart to look at you. I tried to clean you out of me. I tried to rip you out of me. I can't grasp it. My mind won't allow me to grasp it. [SIGHS] Boy. You lose some, you lose some. It really wasn't about you, Simon. It was, it was safe for me there. You were in a safe place, Simon. Not for me, not anymore. Our marriage wasn't a safe place. Safe now? Simon, I have to...go. The girls are waiting for me. NEILLE: You know, the truth is, Simon, you got what you saw. I really think so, you know? -[CAR DOOR CLOSES] -[ENGINE TURNS OVER] [ANSWERING MACHINE BEEPS] SIMON: Neille, are you there? [BEEP] Neille, are you there? [BEEP] Neille, are you there? She's just happier than the rest, I mean, I do my damndest, but she's sickeningly happy. KOBE: Just the attention she gets from all the other ones, that's all. [DOOR CLOSES] Sorry. I keep looking for you. You want me? I can't make you safe. Say you want me. I can't. What, you don't want me or you can't, you can't say it? Got away from us, didn't it? There's something in you, I couldn't reach. I can't get there. I don't want to get there now, I don't need to. -I think we're supposed to try this. -Oh. I think we're supposed to try it. -I think that's what's supposed to happen. -No, I don't think so. I won't let go. It's dark without you. It's empty. Dark and... What, what... Shattered. Alone. Help me out here. -I can't. -Yes, you can. I see you, I'm here. Give that a chance. We've got something. We have something here. You think I don't see you? There's so much goodness in you, there's so much goodness in you. You know, I never for one single solitary moment... -Stopped... -Stopped loving you.
