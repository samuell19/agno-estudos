Husbands, love your wife, as Christ loved the church, that he might sanctify her. Having cleansed her by the washing of the water with the Word, that he might present the church to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing. That she might be holy and without blemish. In the same way, husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. For no one... Thank you very much. Maggie. Beautiful sermon. Good to see you, Maggie. Alright, I'd find the hair of dog. - Yeah. - Great work as usual. - Nice job, brother. - See you. - Yeah. - Alright. It was a beautiful sermon, Reverend Fedder. Thank you, Amelia. I hope to have a husband who loves me like that. God will see to it, I'm sure of it. Are you here by yourself? Your mother hasn't been to services in a while. Is she... She started drinking again. Sometimes further initiative is necessary. I could stop by your home tomorrow, just talk to her. - Could you, please? - Oh, yeah. She's been suffering for a while now, but I'm praying for her happiness. I am. Amelia. Who's that? Amelia. Moving the body up and down. Anne? What? Okay, well, thanks for -- thanks for calling. What is it? So she was walking home, and that's the last you saw of her? Think she might have run away? Well, Jakob was gonna go visit -- I was planning to stop by their house today. Um, Amelia was concerned about her mother's drinking. Yeah, I saw Lucy earlier. She's definitely back on the sauce. It's a Goddamn shame. Oh, I'm sorry about the blasphemy. - Don't worry about it. - That's alright. Living alone with an alcoholic parent can be cause to skip town. I-I don't think that Amelia would leave her mother's house in the middle of the night. I mean, she believed that her mother was -- Amelia had faith. You two are using past tense. Do you suspect foul play? Apologies. Amelia has faith. Well, these situations can be a nightmare for everyone, so it's easy to assume the worst. Were you gonna say something else, Anne? Join us in prayer, Mike? Oh, man. It had to be the Goddamn father. How many times do I have to tell you not to take the Lord's name in vain? Her father died of cancer when she was a baby, Bob. Carol's right. Lucy raised Amelia on her own. You sound just like Dad, always looking for the good qualities in people. But guess what. 9 times out of 10, when a child goes missing, it's a relative or a boyfriend. Did she have a boyfriend? Oh, I mean, that's it, then. They probably ran off together. They're just doing stupid kid stuff. Well, we can only hope it's something so reckless. Sheriff Hess, he says they've hit a dead end. Amelia wasn't like that. Her mother had problems, but Amelia was loyal to her. Good people don't just leave their families. Oh, come on. You expect me to believe a teenage girl doesn't have a boyfriend or two? Carol, how many boyfriends did you have in high school? Don't shame me because I was popular. I just don't understand why a young girl goes missing and you're all so quick to blame her. Nobody's blaming her, Anne. But really, what can we do besides pray for the best? She'll turn up. Don't worry. Anne. Oh, geez, I forgot to tell you. The proposal for the gin mill went through. Is that actually happening? Yeah. The Historical Society thinks, this new retail space will provide a lot of tourism and jobs. Mm, while gutting our history. Well, I don't know about that. The basic foundation of the mill won't be altered. We fought hard for that. We even hired a design firm with some local experience. Do you remember Tom Low? Tom Low? Your old flame? Hardly call him that. I mean, we were just kids. Anyway, he is coming into town, so I'm gonna meet with him. Well, tell Tom I said Tom? Are you hiding back here? I was going for mysterious. I'm not surprised. You were two peas in a pod. True, true. We were. She is the one that labeled me Mr. Mischievous. Yeah, you -- you were uncontrollable in those days. I was. I know I was. You know, Anne... I am surprised that you wound up marrying Jakob. I don't know how to take that. I mean, I like Jakob. Don't get me wrong. I-I don't mean to insult you or Jakob. That's not what I'm saying. It's just that, you, a church mouse? I don't... I don't understand. Whatever happened to the adventurous Anne that wanted to go travel in exotic places and... What about moving to Cairo? - Remember that fantasy? - Yeah. Yeah, I do. I don't know. You make plans for things and then... Life happens, I guess. It was, I think it was around the time that -- that you left town that my mother died. And... Jakob was there for me. He offered me comfort. So did the church. They were both steady when I needed support. Make no mistake, we have a good life. We do. I'm -- I'm -- I'm happy. Yeah. To happiness. This brings back memories. Remember when we used to come here? How could I forget? So, what do you think? I got to be honest with you. This job has got me flying all around the world. But when I heard about this project, I jumped at the offer because of you. I hope that's not the only reason you're here. Well, it's not the only reason. Anne! What in the hell was that? I don't know. Hello? Watch your step. We'll have to air all this out. Yeah. Tom. Tom? Tom! Oh, my God. You scared me. Don't do that. - Oh, I got you good. - You are terrible. So I've been told. Where did those come from? - They weren't here before? - No. They're comfy. Have a seat. I won't bite you. I'm not so sure. You are still so dangerously handsome. What's wrong, Anne? This is so tempting. I just can't do it to Jakob. Are you sure? Yes, Tommy. Thank you for asking. Feelings come and go, but... commitments -- The hell was that? Did you see the size of that thing? No, Tom, don't. No? Thanks, Bob. I thought it was a long shot. I just... you know, wondered if she might have popped over to see Carol. Oh, never mind. She's home. Okay, talk soon. Anne. Where you been? At the mill. How'd it go? Fine. Well, it's really late, you know? I know. I'm going to bed. Fine. I'll, um, be up later. Reach. More aggressive. Pull the elbow. Notice the springing motion of the body. Up and down. Back to front. Reach. I'm heading in soon. Did you make breakfast? And back down. I'm not hungry. And back up. I guess I'll just pick something up - on my way into town. - Bye. Five, six. Get ready to grape vine. To the right side. Two, three, four. What are you? What do you want? Who are you? And what do you want? Who are you? And what do you want? Hand it over. Hand what over? You know what I mean. Fuck you, old man. This ain't the 1980s anymore. Yeah. It's still illegal in this state. Why don't you go molest an altar boy or something, You mistake me for a priest. I'm a minister. This is a church. You should go home. Don't you know there's a girl your age missing? Hey, cool it, Oscar. We want the cops called on us or what? Fucking hate old white dudes. Hello? Geez. Oh, good. You're home. Get changed. I'd like to go out. So... What's the occasion? Does there need to be one? No, not really. It's just unusual. I must be feeling unusual. Could I get a to-go box for my wife, please? Actually, I'm finished. I'm sorry, what? It's good. You'll like it. I was just having a bad dream. I hope that's all it was. What's that mean? Let's talk about this later. Why do you always do this? Do what? Shut me down, push me aside. - You -- - Oh, come on. That's not true. Will you stop interrupting me? Let me finish my thought, God damn it. Sorry. I don't know what's gotten into you lately. But I need to prepare the week's sermon. If thatâ€™s okay. You know, I'm just gonna get something to eat on the way into town. And don't blaspheme. Ma'am, can I help you find something? How much of that could I get? You want the blood? [ Concrete Blonde's "Bloodletting [ (The Vampire Song" playing ] Anne. Jakob. Bob's just on an investor call. Come on in. Want some coffee or tea? You got something a little bit stronger? Tea with a shot of brandy? How about just the brandy. Alright. Where's Anne? Look, I just don't think Anne's the type to fool around. I've already told you that. I'm not saying she is. But ever since she met with Tom Low, she hasn't been acting right. I mean, 40 years I've known this woman. Every day the same. Now I don't know who I'm coming home to. She's hot, she's cold, she's got a new dress, new hair. I-I can't figure her out. You got to confront him, then. I can't do that to Anne. It's your wife, Jakey. What do you think I would do if Carol came home with that kind of bullshit? Yeah, well, I don't know where to find him. He's down here working in the mill, right? So start there and don't stop until he understands the damn message. Just do it before we come over this weekend for dinner. 'Cause Carol's making lasagna, and I just don't want things to be all weird. Anne. Anne! What are you doing? In his second letter to the Corinthians, Paul takes this idea a step further and asks directly "How do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife?" And the answer, of course, is you can never know. And so we are left with faith... ...in the promise that God will take every situation and turn it to His purpose. What on God's green earth have you been eating? I swear, Anne, this looks like dirt. Now you're just being cruel. Cruel is when you see my bill. That's odd. You've got new teeth coming in. What? It's rare, but it's not unheard of. We should set an appointment and check them out. Here. Rinse. Let's brighten that smile. Tom Low? Tom Low? It's Jakob Fedder. Anne's husband. I need to talk to you. Man! Geez! Creepy old man, I don't know why you have such a hard-on for us, but why don't you piss off? Sorry. Sorry. I'm -- I was looking for someone else. Yeah, cool it, Oscar. He's harmless. Yeah. No, she's right. I'm leaving. Kick rocks. Go. Get the fuck out of here. Come on, let's go. Oh, sh-- Hey, man, come on, I'm just -- I was just playing, man. Just stay back. Come on, man. I was just playing. Amelia! How's my suffering mother? Did you bless her? With God's almighty love? Are you here to bless me now? Because I don't want your God's love. I've found a new savior. With a love that gives me strength instead of fear. A love for myself. And right now... ...my master... is in your house. Anne. The Lord is my savior. He restoreth my soul. He leads me in the path of righteousness. Bullshit! Lord, forgive her. She's corrupted. Give me the strength to save her wayward soul. I'm gonna tongue-fuck a hole in your neck until I puke blood. Take that, bitch. Go, go! Why the fuck would she do that?! Shit bit Oscar's throat! She killed him! Look, we're safe out here, okay? That was some motherfuckin' vampire shit, okay?! We need to report it. I got to check on my wife. Fuck off, then! I'm going to the cops. Is she having a heart attack? Hey, Mrs. Fedder, you alright? Mrs. Fedder, you -- You okay in ther-- You alright -- Mrs. Fedder! Mrs. Fedder? Hello? Hey, are you okay in here? Hey, Mrs. Fedder? Hello? Hey, you alright? Hey, could you say something, please? This is getting... fairly uncomfortable for me. Suf-- No, no, no, no. God! No. Anne! I'm sorry, Jakob! It wasn't me. - Of course it was you! - No! I-I didn't want to do it! I was being controlled! This isn't me! It isn't me! Well, who is it, then?! Something... happened, Jakob. What does that mean? - Something happened? When? - The day that I met with Tom... I kissed him, okay? But then... This is so f... effed up! Reverend. Hey, Mike. - Any news on Amelia? - Sort of. Well, not really. It's strange, actually. Strange? Do you know of a young women by the name of Eli Shenks? No, I don't think so. You sure you haven't seen her skateboarding around town with her boyfriend, Oscar? Anyway, she dropped by the station in quite a state. She claims Oscar was murdered at the old Cripple Creek Mill... by a vampire. And she identified Amelia. I chalk that up to really bad taste on her part. But still, we had to go up there and check it out. Yeah. And...? And there was nothing. No body, no blood. Well... that must be a relief. Yeah, except she swears that you were there. Well, I don't know what she's talking about. - I wasn't at the mill. - Oh, of course not. I mean, she says you were the one fighting the vampires. - That's... - Crazy, right? Yeah. Yeah, I'm just assuming that's just some drugged-up preoccupation on her part. There is one thing we found out there, though. Isn't that your church's stamp? I mean, what do you make of that? I have no idea. Yeah. Me neither. You know, normally I wouldn't take these things so seriously, but the boy did go missing. Just like Amelia and Tom Low. Tom Low? - Well, he lives in Chicago. - He does. He came down here to do some business. We found his vehicle abandoned up at the mill, also. He could have just skipped town. Who knows? But still, the timing is just... ...odd. Anyway, I'm sorry to bother you with all this stuff. Just tell Anne I said hello. Sounds like she's pretty... busy at the moment. She is. Yeah. Okay. Well, Mike, you take care. Yeah. You, too. Why didn't you tell me when this first happened? I could have helped you. I felt ashamed. As you should. I'm sorry I hurt you. But there are blessings to this change, you know? I feel more alive than I have in years. Yeah, well, don't get used to it. Drinking blood is not exactly a sustainable lifestyle. What do we do now? I find The Master that Amelia was talking about, and I kill him, and I change you back to the way you were. The way I was? Absolutely. Exactly. Put a stop to this insanity before it goes any further. What does he look like? I don't know. At first, all I could see was a shadow. A shape that I couldn't really make out. But with each visit... the shape does become stronger. Like... it's coming into focus. Well, I was thinking about the mill where you and Tom were attacked. You know, what was Amelia doing there? I mean, are they all hiding there? It might be a pretty clever way to get around the country, dying towns and abandoned mills, you know, far from the prying eyes. This town is perfect then. I'm just trying to figure out why The Master would keep coming after you. Are you jealous? Well... you lusted after another man, and then you act-- Careful, Jakob. Given the circumstances, I think I'm being quite reasonable. Do you remember when we started this? Of course. You asked for the seeds as a wedding gift. I just think it's safer if I go in alone. I mean, we don't know how you're gonna behave in his presence. I mean, you could freak out, you know, or turn into a bat or something. I didn't come here to sit in the car. Well, it's too risky. Besides, you don't have a stake. Pull over. You heard me. There. Now I have a stake. Are you ready? What do you mean, ready? For whatever we find down there. I'm a minister of the Lord, Anne. This is what I was trained for, to fight evil, whatever form it may come in. Will you stop with the Sunday School crap? If we go down there, we go together... as equals. Are you okay with that? Let's just get this over with. Amelia? We've come to help you. You've come to help me, Reverend? That's very considerate. Perhaps you should help your wife instead. Or does he not find the new you very attractive, Mrs. Fedder? Obedience and submission -- that's more their style. But... you have... The Master's love now. There's not a Goddamn thing you can do about it, shit bird. Jakob, how could you?! Attacking a child. Where is your compassion? You have plenty for your wife, even though she -- - Shut up! - Anne, please. Can't you hear her. She's still Amelia. Don't be an idiot. Kill her. No! No, there has to be a better way. - She's manipulating you. - She's lying to you, Jakob. Lord, please, protect me. I knew you'd wuss out. - I told you no! - And I told you to kill her! I could have saved her! Where's your compassion for God's sake? - Compassion?! - You mercy? Don't be naive, Jakob. She would have sucked you dry. What am I letting you turn me into?! I can't do this! The Master might still be in there. We need to finish this. "The Master." What does it matter? You're no different from him now. - You two can have each other. - How can you say that? - I'm your wife! - Not anymore. You belong to him. That's your punishment. It's my what? If you hadn't had your little rendezvous with Tom Low, none of this would be happening. This isn't about Tom or The Master. This is about us, you and me. You had sin in your heart, and you brought this on yourself. So, you're blaming me for being bitten by a vampire? Well, guess what. I think you're just saying these horrible things because you're scared. You're scared to fight for me because ever since we got married, you haven't had to. I've always just been there, doing exactly what you expected me to do. You don't know how to fight for me because you've never done it. So instead... you're just writing me off as some fallen scarlet woman. And that's pathetic and weak. You're weak. Think what you want. I've already crossed too many lines for you. You're a Goddamn coward. I'm getting out of this while I still can, while I still have a little piece of my soul left! Maybe I like who I am now! What am I doin'? Annie? Jakob? Jakob? With one gesture... this could get very messy. Hurting him won't make me yours. I seek no ownership. This is about you. Try and fight it. But you are no longer what you once were. Why keep letting this anchor drag you down? Because I love him. Die or thrive. The choice is yours. Please... No! No! Don't! It's gonna get a lot worse. Thank you. That's not good. We're running out of time. We got to find her, and then we're gonna beat this together. This is just a test. This... thirst is getting unbearable. Well, what about the raw meat? Did you even try it? It's all trash. It doesn't do anything. Look, look. You got to fight it. It's just a sickness. I'm sick, alright? My thoughts are drenched in blood. River of blood. I've got an idea. You're right. It is helping. Dare to take drugs off of kids. It's been a long time since I heard your laugh. It's been a long time since I felt like laughing. I'm sorry I talk over you sometimes. Thank you. I'm sorry I don't speak up more often. What do we do now? Pray for a miracle. Hello. Yes. Of course. How are you? Sorry to hear that. Sure. Be happy to check on her. No problem at all. Okay. I'll call you back. Are you okay to drive? Is The Master here? Mattie? It's Mr. and Mrs. Fedder. Your daughter called. She said you weren't answering your phone. Oh, Mattie. I don't see any bites. What do we do? Oh, Lord. Thank you for this bountiful gift in our time of need. Amen. It's a sign, Annie. That looks heavy. This is... just our laundry. Yeah. Mrs. Perkins washed it for us. It doesn't look like laundry to me. It looks like Mrs. Perkins all rolled up in a bedspread. Go inside. Only if you tell me a swear word. I'm not telling you a swear word. Well, then I'm staying right here. Okay. How about this one? Fuck off. Already know that one. Alright. Hess here. Mike, it's -- it's Mariana. Listen, I don't know how to say this, but... Well, what's wrong? It's the Reverend Fedder. I think I saw him and Mrs. Fedder carrying a body into their house. What are you doing! Come on! I can't be part of this. You know, it's an hour till sunset. I'd like to go check if The Master is holed up there. We should do it together. That's what we are doing. Go gentle on her. Oh, fuck. Hey, Mike. What's up? Hi, Jakob. I could really use your help with something. Would you turn the engine off and step out here. It would really save my back the unnecessary strain. What's in the case? Nothing. Just hospital supplies for administering last rites and so forth. You mind if we take a look. Well, yes, I would, actually. I'm on my way to an important appointment right now. I got to see a very sick patient. - Very sick. - You know what? Why don't we indulge Deputy Colton? He's coming up with a performance review end of the month, right? He could really use the experience. Isn't that right, Colton? Right as rain, Sheriff. Step on back here, Jakob. This is not what you think. Oh, I'm sure we've seen worse. But it's vacation. You get to do what you want. Yeah. That's what you say every time, and I never get to do about half of what I want. Oh, come on. Well, let's pick -- You pick the place this time then. Fine. Do whatever you want. You can do whatever you want. I just want a margarita. As long as you don't puke this time. - Thank you. - Always, babe. A long week. Yeah, it sucks. I didn't go with the spinach this time. I'm getting sick of it. I prefer your meat anyways. That's good stuff. Thank you. Anne! You ever see something you couldn't explain, Sheriff? Oh, like a vampire, Jakob? How many people have you killed, Reverend? Sheriff Hess, you are never gonna believe the call that just came in. Yeah. Yeah. Of course. Okay. Okay. Yes. Yes. Okay. I will. Thank you, officer. We'll be here. J-- Just give me a sec. This is absolutely fucked, and if you drag Jakob into this shit, I will kill you before the cops get here. What is taking them so long? I mean, what is going on? - I can't stay here anymore. - They'll be here, okay? Just wait outside for them, okay, I love you. Yeah. I did hear that. No, she's still sitting there. She hasn't said a word. Believe me, I haven't taken my eyes off her. Goddamn it! Carol! Carol! Carol! Run and don't look back. Yeah, right. Get up. Carol? What in the hell are you doing? Adam was born first, and then Eve. It was not Adam who was deceived, but the woman who was deceived and fell into transgression. Does that sound fair to you? My husband is a good man. What does "good" have to do with it? He is afraid of the life within you. And you're not? I choose those I change with care. The rest are just pets. Anne... No! It's good to see you strong, Anne. What do you want from me? Why do you always think in terms of what others want? Where do you think that sad instinct comes from? I, too, was once a mouse, scurrying between the feet of self-important men. Until the day my master gifted me the kiss of eternity. It gave me confidence. It freed me from the shackles of domestic dependency. I see the same potential in you. What exactly do you want, Anne? I want to live a bigger life. You can. The choice has always been yours. Is that why I haven't fully turned. Indeed. Taste my blood, and you'll control the hunger. You'll be beholden to nothing but your own whims. But if you don't, the hunger will continue to control you day after day -- Colton! I got him, Sheriff. Deputy, I thought you said you got him. They'll never accept you now. What the fuck? Your life could be so much bigger than this, Anne. It's time you made a decision for yourself. I'm stuck, Sheriff! What's that? Oh, shit! Ask yourself... how different the world seemed this week? How it sounded. How it tasted. 30 years of being dutiful, obedient, supportive. But never satisfied your own desires. Were you... ever... really you? Or were you just Jakob's wife? "The great dragon was thrown down, that old serpent, who was called the Devil and Satan, deceiver of the whole world..." This is just their nature! This is how they'll always be. "Thrown down into the world and all his angels with him." What have you done? I finished it. That's what I've done. It wasn't your choice to make. How you gonna write this one up, Deputy? Domestic dispute. Non-violent. Yeah. Yeah. That's a good answer. Listen, this is... This is more your domain than mine, Reverend. But it needs to end tonight. What do we do now? Sell the house. And just... vanish. And I want to make my own decisions from now on. Do we look for a cure? No. I like who I've become. The hunger will return. But we can still have a happy marriage... ...if we set some ground rules. So, I'm supposed to trust you?
