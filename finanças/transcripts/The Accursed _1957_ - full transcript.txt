Colonel Price! Charles Price here. 'One moment, sir. Incoming call from Berlin.' - 'Go ahead, please.' - Hello? Theodore Dehmel here, colonel. - I have news for you. - Have you found Zimmerman? Yes. Hiding over here in a displaced persons camp. Did he give you the name of the man we want? - Yes, sir. - Who is it? I'd rather not say it over the telephone. - Better if I came to England. - 'As you wish.' - When will the others be there? - Sometime tomorrow the 25th. I'll send them the usual cablegrams to remind them. Good. I'll be with you tomorrow evening. In a way, Theodore, I'm sorry you've done such a good job. I know what you mean, sir. If you like I can forget what I know. I have a bad memory. No, no, no, I'll finish what I started. See you tomorrow then, 11:30. Oh, and thank you, Theodore. Goodbye. The end of a search stint. You don't sound pleased, sir. Doesn't please me to know that I'll have to kill one of my best friends in the next 36 hours. Of course not, sir. You'd better send the cables. The usual places, sir? Yeah. Uh, Joseph's playing at La Scala, Milan. Have the others arrived? You and your father are the last. Oh. We should have caught an earlier plane. Oh, don't fuss. Sadness on a night like this? Memories belong to the past. Sure this music is for the future? Professor! Vicki! Hello, professor! Good to see you. - How are you? - How are you? Most of us live in Liepzburg yet we must all wait until we come to England before meeting. Stefan. Stefan.. ...after dinner I'd like to have a talk with you in the study. Are you in trouble, Charles? Something very likely. All of us are your friends, Charles. Good friends. Let's go to dinner. Ladies and gentlemen.. ...Gerhart Kerrer. Gerhart Kerrer. As you know, during war, Gerhart Kerrer the leader of our underground movement in Liepzburg was executed by the Nazis. I became your new leader. Each year since the war we have met on the anniversary of his death. For this brief meeting between friends 'some of you have traveled far...very far..' What are you trying to say, Charles? The doctor is right. I'm trying to say something and I'm finding it very difficult. Stefan Toller says that memories belong to the past. And that I couldn't agree more. But tonight, the memory of Gerhart Kerrer 'becomes very much a part of the present.' Gerhart Kerrer was executed by the Nazis. But he was betrayed by someone in this room. Have you.. Yes, Thomas? Have you any proof, sir? My man is arriving from Berlin. He will bring the name of the traitor. I presume that the police will be kept out of this. It need concern only us. - What time will he get here? - 'Eleven thirty.' He's catching the 8:10 plane from Berlin. Who is it? Who is it? Stefan? Who is it? Oh.. Theodore! There's...there's been a mistake. One of us was too quick for you, Charles. There's nobody but myself to blame. I should've anticipated this. Did he have time to-to name one of us? No. All he said was "There's been a mistake." Well, couldn't that mean that-that Gerhart wasn't betrayed? That it was all a mistake? That's why one of us stabbed him because he was bringing such good news. - Will the knife help? - I'm afraid not. This happens to belong to me. It's one of a pair from the hall. Apparently, our murderer has the other knife. Take care of this, Clinton. When Theodore came into this house tonight the knife was already in his back. Tell me, doctor, how long can a man live like that? Well, it depends. Any exertion would hasten the death. Walking, two or three minutes, no more. That places Theodore at the front door when it happened. I don't suppose anybody has anything to say? Just wondering. When I came into this room tonight the lights were out and everyone was gone. Stefan...was anybody here when you came out from the study? Oh, Vicki, Joseph, Friederich, everybody. Who was the first to leave? Me I suppose. Vicki and I were next. We went upstairs. I took father to his room and-and then I went to mine. I must have been next. I went into the dining room...for a drink. When I came back into this room, Baum was by himself. The doctor and I went upstairs to our rooms...together. That's quite correct, Charles. Now, Thomas, you came back from the dining room. What then? Well, Baum spoke to me for a while before going upstairs. I finished my drink. Alone. And walked...in the garden. There were drinks in here. Why'd you go into the dining room? The siphon wasn't there. Which one of you switched off the lights? Doctor, you went upstairs with Friederich but a short while ago you came in from the garden. I...I left Friederich and came down to see if the others were here. The room was in darkness. The front door was open, I went to close it and then I decided to go for a stroll. Why didn't you switch on the lights? It wasn't necessary. You were lucky, doctor, not to have met the murderer. He must have just switched off the lights to cover the theft of the knives. But why both of them? The murderer's polite way of warning us that he will kill again... to safeguard himself. Coming from you, Joseph, that is a brilliant deduction. Between the time when you were all leaving this room and Clinton coming to fetch you.. ...did any of you see each other? How convenient for the murderer. What happens now? Frankly, I don't know. Well, I do. One of us betrayed Gerhart to the Nazis. It's murder. 'The same person killed the colonel's man.' One of us is a cold-blooded killer. And I for one intend to see the killer pay for the murders! I-I think we all feel like that but unless the guilty one confesses I... We shall all be here till kingdom come. I need hardly tell you.. ...the need for urgency in getting rid of our caller. Will you please all relax. Thomas, be careful. Joseph, will you play something? Clinton. Is your master in? - Who is it, Clinton? - Two gentlemen, sir. - Army officers. - 'Show them in.' Please don't let us disturb you. Not at all. This is Major Shane. I'm Bobby. Lt. Grant I'm Price. Charles Price. Colonel Price? Stutton? Sorry for the intrusion, colonel. Ignition burnout. We took the liberty of leaving our car in your drive. May we phone the camp from here? Well, certainly. That piece you are playing, I didn't recognize it. Oh, you wouldn't. It's my own. Has it a name? - It's called Prelude... - It's a prelude without a name. 'We're through, sir.' Sgt. Davis, Major Shane. Our car has broken down. Ignition. It's in Colonel Price's drive two miles east of the London Wells Road. You do know it? Well, good. When? That's too long. I'll expect you in two hours. What's the news, sir? All transportations out in the ranges. May be a few hours before they can get here. It's bad luck. When you finish your drink, lieutenant we'll go. Yes, sir. Charles.. ...the major and the lieutenant have two hours to wait. Oh, how rude of me. I'd completely forgotten. Clinton. You're gonna stay here till your car comes. - It's very kind of you, sir. - It's a pleasure. Major Shane, Lt. Grant Vicki Toller, her father Stefan Toller Dr. Neumann, Alfred Baum, Friederich Suderman Thomas Rilke and Joseph Brezina. - Will you have a whiskey? - Thank you. - Are you all Germans? - I'm Swiss. Joseph is Polish. Of course. Last summer in Lisbon I saw you play. I am honored. Do you object to Germans, major? Not particularly, now that the war is over. That does not answer my question. It should. I dislike wars. Why, lieutenant... isn't that intelligence? Yes. We have a policeman amongst us. May I ask what an American intelligence man is doing in these parts? Camp screening's purely routine. You disappoint us, major. I'm sorry, Fraulein. You must find life unexciting after Liepzburg. Life there is similar to that in most English provincial towns. I was thinking of the war years. You've met my guests before? No, only their names. I was in Berlin during '42. I liaised with Ehrlich. Gerhart's outside contact. He put me in the picture about all of you. It's a pity we never met, major. When did you take over from Gerhart? September '43. They, uh, they shot him, didn't they? I'm sorry. We all loved him very dearly. He was far more to us than a leader. Gerhart was... Gerhart! Gerhart! Joseph! Joseph, where are you going? 'Let him go, Charles.' I will go to him. I seem to have upset things. You mustn't reproach yourself, major. Joseph, is a highly accomplished young man but like all great artists... extremely excitable. Joseph lacks self-control! That is unkind. Gerhart loved Joseph like a son. The war office didn't think that was funny sending two consignments to Russia for the price of one. How is he? He will be down presently. If you would all forget what happened.. The young man's lucky to have a good friend. - A pretty compliment, major. - You're going out? I thought some fresh air before going to bed. If the major will excuse me. Of course. Don't stay out too long. You like my daughter, major? She's a very unusual girl, sir. She's a lived a lifetime yet she's just beginning to live. Paradoxical but true. Is it private? No, the professor has just finished. Stefan, I'd like to have a word with you in the study. You mind, Shane? Please go ahead. Can I help you, sir? No. No, thank you, Clinton. Just looking. Where's the the colonel.. ...and the professor? In the study. You alright? Oh, it was nothing. Excuse me. I hate to prompt you, Charles, if the major and the lieutenant had left without some gesture from you. Yes, it would've looked bad not asking them to stay. Anyway, they will be leaving in one hour. We still have to watch Joseph, he's ready to crack. There's a greater danger than Joseph. - Shane, of course. - Precisely. Vicki has sensed it, so have I. But what are they here for? I don't like it. The War Office and the American authorities dropped the Gerhart investigation years ago. And no one outside this house knows about tonight's murder. If I'm wrong, they will be leaving soon until then, let us be careful. Where did Vicki go? For a walk. Already, my dear major Liepzburg has rebuilt its university and most of it's churches. Did you manage to save the murals of Ramsay II? No. They and the frescoes of Minos were destroyed when the museum was...bombed. War is a juggernaut, destroys all and everybody. Even it's master. Oh, please continue, gentlemen. Your father thinks that war is a Frankenstein that finally destroys it's own master. And what do you think, major? Unfortunately, war is a necessary evil. - 'An interesting hypothesis.' - It's more than that. If I knew what you were talking about I might agree or disagree. If a thing is necessary, we accept it. If something is evil, we reject it. How can evil be necessary if we reject it? It's the same with a murderer. Killing is an outlet for his emotions. What about a premeditated murder? Committed by the cold-blooded killer? A fallacy, Joseph. Emotions govern all killing. Whether the motive be revenge or fear. I arrested a man who killed his best friend for destroying his faith. Colonel Price's house. Would you just hold on a moment, please? For the major, sir. Thank you, Clinton. Shane speaking. Yes. Well, if you can't do any better than that, it'll have to be. No transportation will be released from the ranges until morning. We'll be putting out, Lieutenant Grant and I'll use the chairs down here until then. Major, I think we can do better than that. Thomas, mind moving into the small room at the hall's end? - Not at all. - That's settled then. Clinton, could you show the major and lieutenant to Mr. Thomas' room? You'll find pajamas in my room. I will go up and clear my things out. 'I will take that, Clinton.' Oh, thank you, miss. You have a grease spot on your nose, Fraulein Toller. Goodnight. - Goodnight all. - 'Goodnight, major.' You should have let him go. Be reasonable, what excuse could Charles have offered? There's nothing to be gained by arguing. They are here, whether we like it or not. I for one, do not like it. I wanna get this mess over and done with. Will you please keep your voices low? What are they really doing here? Why must we assume that they are here for any particular purpose? Yes. They're story could be true. Don't tell me you believe that nonsense about lack of transport. Well, I don't see why not. Because, doctor, army majors are not usually left stranded in the middle of nowhere through lack of transport. 'You're mistaken, Joseph.' In England, there's not the same respect for colonels and majors as there is in the German army. For all we know, their car may be perfectly alright. Did your walk take you to the majors car, Vicki? You know I did, father, and so does the major. How about the car? Strangely enough, the ignition was completely burned out. I suppose I could be wrong... You are not wrong, father, and we all know it. I'm afraid that, uh, it looks like checkmate, Charles. I agree. We can do nothing about our own problem till we know why Shane came to this house. One of you must be laughing at us! It's only a respite for the murder, nothing more. Now, I want you all to go to bed and stay there until morning. If any attempts to leave 'I shall take it as an admission of guilt.' And I shall shoot to kill. Now, is that quite clear. Whatever you have in mind, be careful, Charles. Did you find what you were searching for, major? I underestimated your vigilance, colonel. It has been rather a long time. I think I'll go upstairs, sir. I'd like it better if you stayed. Coffee please, Clinton. You haven't answered my question, major. I'm waiting to hear if you found what you were searching for. If I knew what I was searching for I'd be able to answer. Still fencing, major. I'd have been perfectly justified in shooting you both. After inviting us to stay? You're relying on the guests to substantiate your statements.. ...remember they're my guests and also my friends. Thank you for being honest. I will need your word for it, that you are officers. - I assure you, that the major... - Be quiet, Grant. If I thought you were masquerading I should've had you arrested hours ago by the constable. Now, let's stop playing a game, shall we? 'You've been sent here for a job' and I think I've every right to know what it's all about. I can't say I admire your method of approach but I'm prepared to overlook that and still help you. 'But I want the truth.' I think you deserve at least that, sir. But I also expect you to be equally as honest with me. I'm listening. Do you know Theodore Dehmel? Never heard of him. Yesterday Theodore Dehmel visited a German in a displaced persons camp. In the American zone and the Russian border. Reason for his visit's unknown to us. All we do know is that, after Dehmel left the man he came to see committed suicide. We were unable to save the German but before he died, he confessed that he was a Hans Zimmerman one of Nazi. He also mentioned a name that you know. Name you know very well, colonel. 'Gerhart.' Records show that Gerhart was betrayed to the Nazis by member of the underground movement. - This you know. - Yes. An investigation was carried out after the war to find his betrayer, and as you know this came to nothing. I still can't quite understand why you've come here. 'Isn't it rather obvious?' Dying Nazi gives us the name Gerhart. Gerhart is dead, but we do know his friend. Colonel Price. Oh, I see. You think I'll be able to tell you something about Theodore.. ...or is it Zimmerman that you're interested in? We checked up on Zimmerman. He was in charge of records and codes at Nazi headquarters at Stutton during the war. After Dehmel found him in the displaced persons camp.. ...he knew the game was up and hung himself. So, you're really after Theodore Dehmel? Wanna find out the reason for his visit to Zimmerman. Don't wait up, Clinton. Goodnight, sir. Now, where were we? We were interested in Theodore Dehmel. And I should like to help you but.. I understand, colonel. Is there anything else? One small point, sir, and you study on a leather couch. I found traces of fresh blood. You don't miss a thing, major. Today was the first day of the shoot. I bagged a brace, took him in the study. Telephone rang, I put them on the sofa. I'm sorry I can't accommodate you with a body. Good coffee. Clinton will be pleased. We never did find out who betrayed Gerhart to the Nazis. It's a pity Zimmerman died, he might've remembered. It's possible. The records show no evidence of an official inquiry amongst the underground movement in Liepzburg. The authorities thought it injudicious to warn the guilty person by holding one. 'But the members were carefully screened by intelligence.' Purely routine. Before the movement was disbanded. It is possible then the betrayer is to found here amongst your guests. Possible, but hardly likely. You must remember that although the salvaged Nazi records gave the code number of Gerhart's underground betrayer it doesn't necessarily follow that it was his group member. It could be any one of four other underground movements operating within 18 miles of Stutton. True, but you must admit that it's more than likely to have been someone near home. Someone who knew him well. Like a member of his own group. If you put it that way, yes. Is there anything else? No, I think that will be all, sir. Thank you. Help yourself to some more coffee. You know where your room is. Goodnight. Goodnight. If you don't mind my saying so, sir I think the colonel was lying. You noticed that? He's not a very good actor. No, he's not a very good actor. He's a worried man, Grant. How does it go? That's all I remember. You have a retentive memory. Strange such a wonderful piece of music doesn't have a title. And who exactly were you playing for in the middle of the night? Anybody. I wanted to chat with one of the guests. My playing was the bait. You turned out to be the mouse. I'm glad I caught you. Are you trying to make love to me, major? What's this all about, Vicki? Colonel Price told us why you're here. We'd like to help you... I asked what's going on here. And I have told you, Major Shane, nothing. - I'm sorry. - Oh, do stop apologizing. I'm so.. Major, may I ask you why you are here? Thought you said Price had told you? He told us about Theodore Dehmel if that's what you mean but what is your real reason? At first Dehmel was the only reason for my visit. And now? I think Theodore Dehmel went to visit Zimmerman to find out the name of the man who betrayed Gerhart. But why? Can't you think? You are talking in riddles. Apart from the authorities who would want such information? Well, I can think of eight people. We have all buried the past. That why y'all meet each year to commemorate your dead leaders memory? Who told you? Thomas. Thomas talks too much. Our reports say Gerhart was a paragon among men. But none of you seem interested in finding his betrayer. Not very subtle, major. I think you know how we all feel about him. I think you all love him enough to want to find his betrayer. I also think that Dehmel's working for one or all of you. There's nothing more I can say. Answer me one more question. Earlier I told the others a man had once killed his best friend for destroying his faith. Thomas dropped his glass, why? Whose door? I don't know, sir. Ah, you're just in time for a drink. Careful. Sorry, it's neat. There's no soda. What were you doing in the corridor just now? - Was I? - Lieutenant Grant saw you. Then if he saw me, I must've been. What were you doing? Doing? Nothing. Soda water, that's it, I was on my way downstairs for a siphon.. ...when he passed me. Who passed you? Can't remember. Too dark. Thought it was the colonel. That was why I came back into the room. He doesn't like me drinking too much. What is all the fuss about? Someone tried to stick me or Vicki with a knife. What's happened? Someone tried to kill Ms. Toller or the major. - She's not hurt, sir. - Thank God. Who was it, Shane? It's too dark to see. - I ought to go to her. - There's no need, doctor. I'll expect you all downstairs in ten minutes. I'll send your daughter up to you, sir. Friederich and Joseph must be heavy sleepers. Might ask the colonel to let you have his revolver. An idea we might need it. Thomas is drunk. I left him in his room. I think this time you all know why I'm here so I'll get straight to the point. You can answer my questions or Lt. Grant will telephone for the police. And somehow I don't think you want them brought into this. - Which is it to be, colonel? - Go ahead, Major Shane. Whose is it? One of a pair from the hall, sir. One of you is a potential murder. - If not already a murderer. - How do you mean? Not more than 15 minutes ago someone in this house was frightened enough 'to attempt murder.' 'You said he may already be a murderer.' Gerhart was executed by the Nazis. That makes his betrayer a murderer. And implies that one of us is guilty. I'm afraid so, doctor. Forgive me, major, but I'm disappointed in you. For a man to be frightened, he must have something to fear. If as you say Gerhart's betrayer is amongst us 'what has he to fear?' Zimmerman is dead. And as for Theodore Dehmel if he knows the betrayer's identity.. '...why hasn't he brought the police?' Major Shane thinks that Theodore Dehmel is working for one or all of us. Surely we would've gone to the police if Dehmel had told us the identity of the betrayer. Possibly. As it is, it appears that Theodore Dehmel has contacted neither the police nor any of you. I wonder why. That's quite obvious. Dehmel learned nothing from Zimmerman. Could be. On the other hand, he may still turn up. Or is it that he's already been here? You're not making sense, Shane - Baum's already... - I remember what Baum said. If Dehmel had told you the identity of the betrayer he would have sent for the police. Exactly. Why should we want to protect Gerhart's betrayer? Frankly, colonel, I haven't the faintest idea. Neither have we. Major, we're all perfectly willing to cooperate but so far you've produced absolutely nothing to substantiate your statements. Do I have to substantiate this? Thomas dropped his glass tonight. Why? You could ask him. Why did you keep your study door locked? You searched my study? Alright, Grant. What's that? The sample of the blood from your study couch. Enough to stop a car. Have this analyzed. If it's what I think it is, come back with the police. Yes, sir. - Damn you, Shane. - Hold it, Grant. - Who's he? - Theodore Dehmel's. - What happened? - Theodore's working for me. Tonight I was to have known the identity of Gerhart's betrayer. Theodore arrived with the information but somebody had already got to him. He was knifed in the back and died in his room. The knife was one from the hall. I cleaned it and put it back. What happened to the body? It was in the study when you arrived. And later? Clinton and I took it to the woods. Of all the crazy stunts. What you hope to gain by such a move? We have to tell him everything, Charles. Very well. I suppose you'll find it difficult to understand our behavior. Without making too many excuses 'I suppose the war is to blame to some extent.' In those days, we were our own judge and jury. And executioner. You must be insane, all of you. If it is insanity to punish a murderer, then we are insane. We have courts to administer punishment. Morally Gerhart's betrayer belongs to primitive court of the underground. Legally the murderer belongs to the state. Academically, you're both wrong. At present, the murderer belongs very much to himself unless you find him. How the devil did you hope to get away with it? - If you had no family... - Stop this nonsense. Thank yourselves I arrived when I did. - We have not asked for... - Stop fighting me, Baum. Now, about the rest of you? I think we ought to tell the major all we know. That's sensible of you, Mr. Suderman. You always were weakest. Go ahead, Shane, it's your party. Were there any papers on Dehmel? 'Nothing to help.' Which of your guests knew he was coming? All of them. All account for their movements during the time of murder? There's no help from that quarter. They were all in and out of their rooms impossible to check. 'The only thing that might help is something Dehmel said' before he died. He said, "There's been a mistake." A mistake about what? Your guess is as good as mine. What of the attempt on you and Vicki? 'I still think the murderer panicked because he thought 'we knew something.' - And do you? - Not yet. But I intend to. Before any of you leave this room I'm going to find out all about you. You can lie and you can cheat. But I promise you, I'll find out. We'll start with you. But, but I don't know anything at all. I-I... The others will tell me about you. You tell me about them. Clever, major. Did Mr. Baum ever quarrel with Gerhart? I hardly think it's within my province to answer. Tell him anything he wants to know. Well.. Yes, Alfred did sometimes quarrel with Gerhart. But then, so did all of us. You must understand, major, that it is impossible for a group to share so much over a number of years 'without a clash of personalities.' - Human nature... - Thank you, sir. What were the quarrel's about mostly? Differences of opinion. About the organization. Did you resent Gerhart's position as leader? Not his position. Only some of his impossible ideas. Those so called impossible ideas were always right, Baum. - He was lucky. - And you were jealous. 'You weren't exactly the best of friends with him' the day before he was shot. My quarrel meant nothing. It meant enough for him to strike you. That's enough! What did you quarrel about? Me, major. Gerhart was old enough to be my father. Joseph misunderstood his affections and told him so. Is that right? I made a fool of myself. Gerhart hit me. After that, he was sorry. That's all there is to it. Were you and Vicki in love? I have never been in love with any man. You can't suspect Vicki. 'She was with you when the knife was thrown' The knife missed her. Only because you pulled her away in time. If your daughter had betrayed Gerhart and killed Dehmel you would protect her? Naturally. Knife thrown to Miss Vicki while talking to me would place you above suspicion, right, professor? Ingenious, major. But quite untrue. Aren't you forgetting lack of motive? Gerhart seems to have been a man who generally got what he went after. Perhaps Joseph was right. Gerhart's attention proved too much for your daughter. Vicki has killed and would kill me but she would not betray. What was the relationship between Gerhart and Friederich? How can one man know another's thoughts? To find out, you'd have to ask Friederich. 'Or Gerhart's.' I'm asking you. I'm well aware of that, major. You'll have to ask one of these others. I don't want any part of your...your game. You and the others have been playing hide and seek with the dead body. Covering up for each other and filling this house with your lies. 'You dare sneer at my method of questioning?' I'll give you two seconds to answer my question or I'll prefer charges against you for destroying evidence in a murder case. - Can he do that? - I'm afraid so. Well, doctor. Very well. Our tolerance of Friederich's inabilities 'was not shared by Gerhart.' I did my best to.. Go on, doctor. Friederich was responsible to the Nazis for the good behavior of the people of Liepzburg. There was some of us who thought that as mayor, he might have done more for the underground. Please don't misunderstand, major. For all his faults, Friederich was and is an honorable man. He was not a pro Nazi. Thank you, Stefan. If you had betrayed Gerhart it would have strengthened your position with the Nazis. I...I suppose so. But I did not betray him. During the occupation, colonel, was Dr. Neumann hiding with you? The Nazis were short of doctors. They allowed him to practice. Were any of his patients Nazis? A were few high ranking officers. They were sometimes a useful source of information to the doctor. - And to us. - Smart work. How did the doctor get on with Gerhart? Oh, they were good friends. If you're thinking that the doctor's a possible suspect forget it. Six months before Gerhart was betrayed the doctor operated on him for a bullet in his back. Doctor could have let him die. You seem to have a clean bill of health, doctor. Thank you, major. Perhaps, you had no reason for letting Gerhart die when you operated. That's all. You may go your rooms till I want you. - Have you forgotten Thomas? - No, doctor. It may seem hard to you but I like to have a man present when other people are talking about him. Not very encouraging. I'm afraid not. Mix some drinks, Clinton. I wonder what Theodore meant by "There's been a mistake." If we knew that, I think we'd also know the killer. How long as he been with you? He was my sergeant in the '14 war. Of all your guests upstairs, sir do you have any idea who committed the murder? That's rather a tall order, young man. You think a lot of the colonel, don't you? Colonel lost his arm saving my life, sir. Thank you, sir. 'Thank you, Clinton.' Your assistance wants to know who the killer is. How about it, Shane? You formed any opinion? Opinions? Yes. Suspicions.. And if you fail to nail the chap, what then? American army regulations is pretty much the same as your own. There'll be officials sent here from Washington for not calling in the local police. You still have Thomas though. He won't be able to help him. Anyways, he's a strange boy. There's something you ought to know about him. Before he joined us, Thomas was a Nazi. Don't worry, we checked and double checked before we allowed him in the underground. He was a member of the Hitler Youth Movement. He's no worse, no better than the rest of them. It's you. I thought you'd be coming to see me sooner or later. What's that you've got in your hand? That's a cushion. You must be crazy. You'll never get away with it. If you come any nearer.. ...I will kill you. Ah! - Who is it, Clinton? - It's Mr. Thomas, sir. Just a minute, Clinton. Alright, Grant. Bring Thomas down here. The killer worked quietly. None of the others seemed to have been disturbed. Lieutenant Grant could have run into him. Yes, he could have. Shall I speak to any of the others? No. Not yet. If only he could tell us what he knows. He may not have been aware of his own knowledge. Anyway whatever it was.. ...the murderer wasn't taking any chances. You know, Shane, I don't mind for myself but honestly, I'm scared for the others. Notice his face, not a mark on it. That's what happens when a man's been suffocated. Something... At this moment, I mean to sit in the living. You want to call in the police? No, I'm making no excuses for tonight's business or my own conduct. If you hadn't come, we should've gone on with our original plan. Thomas's death alters everything. It's getting out of hand. You don't think I can control it? I don't mean that. You're doing a good job. But not good enough to find the murderer. Given time, I think you could accomplish even that. I'm thinking of the others. It's 4:15 now, give me until 7:00. - And then what? - You'll have your murderer. Then you know who it is? I know, but I have to prove it. Meantime what happens if our friend strikes again? Somehow I don't think he will. I'm sorry, Shane. I can't take that chance. Excuse me, sir and if you'll pardon the expression. The major has stuck his neck out to help us and I think it's only fair we oughta help him now. - Oh, you do, do you? - Yes, sir. Alright, Clinton. - Till 7:00, Shane. - Thank you, Clinton. Anything I can do to help? I'm leaving it to you and Clinton to keep the others upstairs and not let them find out about Thomas. Above all, don't let them come down until sent for. Ask Vicki to come downstairs and bring a coat with her. Thomas may yet tell us what he knew. Why did you send for me? I want your help, Vicki. You're a man of many moves, major. Not long ago you were trying to place me under suspicion. - And now.. - Now I need your help. Is it true that.. ...you've never been in love with any man? Don't you think you'd better tell me why you sent for me? Thomas has been murdered. Our friend stuck a pillow over his face. Poor Thomas. - Do the others know? - No. Vicki.. ...I've promised to deliver the murderer to Price by 7:00. And you are not sure who it is. - Bulls-eye. - Then why? The colonel wants to call in the police. I'm nearly there, but I want more time. You're an illogical fool, major. I'm illogical, Vicki, yes, but no fool. You will have to convince me. First, I don't think it's the work of a pro-Nazi. Otherwise, he wouldn't have stopped at betraying Gerhart. one or two of your friends. You don't ever look the human element. Supposing the poor Nazi after having betrayed Gerhart was was filled with remorse. Wouldn't that account for him not betraying the rest of us? Is it likely that a man who kills in cold blood like our murderer, would suffer from fits and remorse? I was forgetting the murders. The last time I asked you why Thomas dropped his glass murderer tried to kill one of us. To make doubly sure I wouldn't find out he silenced as Thomas. So, the knife was intended for you. You know what I said? A man killed his best friend for destroying his faith. You think Gerhart destroyed the faith placed in you and because of that, one of us betrayed him? - Yes, Vicki. - But it doesn't make sense. It is all out of proportion. Look, a man can have his faith destroyed in many ways. A best friend can steal his wife. The leader can abuse the trust placed in him. Now, Gerhart might have done one of these things or something worse. When I was a little girl in Liepzburg.. ...our milkman would let me ride to school in his cart. One day, the horse was stubborn and the milkman kicked him. That night, I cried myself to sleep. Never spoke to the milkman again. How do you propose to find a man who has lost his faith? Well, if the murderer thinks I know as much as Thomas might force his hand. Murderer may not miss next time. Vicki, if the murderer's who I think it is you're gonna be hurt and deeply hurt. What do you want me to do? It isn't gonna be pleasant. I want you to play a nursemaid to a dead man. The major has some disturbing news for you. What does the colonel mean, major? He means, doctor that we're about to know the identity of murderer. I congratulate you, major. 'Thank you, Joseph. But you're a little premature.' Do I detect a shadow of doubt, major? There's no doubt, professor. I already know the murderer. And so does someone else. I also know the motive. Gerhart's killer destroyed the faith place in him 'by his best friend.' It's the most idiotic suggestion I've heard. It's not a very strong motive for murder. First I thought that when Thomas told me. But when the murderer tried to suffocate him not more than two hours ago, motive began to make sense. Before losing consciousness, Thomas managed to ring for help. Murderer heard someone coming and had to make a quick exit. He didn't make a good job of Thomas. Did you, Joseph? No, major. I don't believe you have a case. You're trying to-to create something out of nothing. Don't take my word for it. Why don't you ask Thomas? Thomas. You're in front of witness, Thomas. Tell 'em what you told me. Tell 'em how Joseph crept into your room 'while you were lying in your bed.' 'And tell 'em how he..' Thomas! This time, Thomas. You'll not get away with it. You swine, Shane. - Put that down, Joseph. - You stay out of this, colonel. No tricks, doctor. Over there. I betrayed the Gerhart, and killed two men. They can only hang me once if I killed you. - That's right, Joseph. - Joseph. You don't know what you're doing. You and Shane make a fine pair. When you reach Thomas, tell him I hope he rots in hell. Sorry about that, Joseph. Hold it, men. Stay where you are, all of you. - Why don't you go after him? - He's got a gun upstairs. Joseph! Be sensible and come down. You're wasting your time, Shane. Look out your bedroom windows! Another one of your tricks, Shane? What are we waiting for? There's been enough bloodshed. He'll be down. He's coming. Leave him, Bobby. Thank you, major. - Get the transportation. - Sir. You mind if Clinton gets me a drink? You're a clever devil. Just call it luck. You're too modest, major. Thomas knew you'd lost faith in Gerhart. I confided in him.. ...the day before I betrayed Gerhart. Almost forgot about the incident until you reminded him last night explaining about motives. That's when he began to suspect me. The fool.. ...was going to blackmail me. Gerhart destroyed your faith in him. How? Gerhart did everything for me. I loved him. We all loved him for what he stood for. He was our ideal. Then I found out he'd been in touch with Berlin. He was going over to the Nazis. I tried to reason with him, but he said England was beaten. They were fighting a lost cause. I called him a traitor. And he struck me. Baum saw him strike me. I made the excuse we had been quarrelling about Vicki. Why didn't you tell Col. Price the truth? Would they have believed me? Look at them now. They still think I'm lying. Go on. I wanted to punish Gerhart yet still keep his name alive. As a symbol of right. That's why I betrayed him instead of shooting him myself. How is it the Nazis shot him if he was going over to them? Berlin had notified a team about Gerhart's change of heart. When they did, it was too late. The local Nazis had executed him. Ironical, major, isn't it? I killed Dehmel because I thought he was going to denounce me. Instead Dehmel's evidence would've established you as a hero. And got rid of Gerhart, the traitor. That's what he meant when he said, "There's been a mistake." Zimmerman must've told him. Funny. You know, major, I.. ...I could so easily have been a hero.
