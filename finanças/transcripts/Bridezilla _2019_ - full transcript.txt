What are we doing here? Siska. There's something I've been wanting to tell you. I need to get home soon. Siska. Actually, Actually I… I like you. Andre. -I don't know. -Siska. Trust me. I really like you. Would you be my girlfriend? -Siska. -Andre. Siska. Andre. Mom, no. Dara, you're still a kid. I know, but that part was exciting. I want to know what happens next. Dara, you'll be able to feel it yourself once you're old enough. Promise me that when you get married, your wedding will be beautiful, just like you dream it will be. "Find the right person and have a perfect wedding" was the best piece of advice I got from my mom, and I still remember it today. Well, I don't know clearly yet who the person is that I'm going to marry. But, I have a clear picture of the wedding that I'm going to have in the future. How romantic. I have to work so hard to pay off the wedding debt! You agreed to my choice of wedding. It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Stop bringing it up. Thanks to my mom's advice, I've succeeded in making people's dream weddings come true. All department chiefs, please come here. Is everything ready? -Yes. -It's ready. All clear? I want the decorations to be ready in three hours. Remember, no mistakes, not even little ones. Hold it. Look! Dara. Nyinyir Show has made a post about our wedding! "The Wedding of The Century." Oh my God, that's great, right? I still have one more bit of information. We have a number of media confirmed to be coming to cover us. We got 200 of them! OK, guys, let's make this wedding a successful one. -Break a leg! -Break a leg! Let's go! Have any of you seen Key? Dara! Dara, I can't find the dress and headpiece for that skunk. I swear, I had everything prepared, it was right in front of me. The dress and headpiece are in her hotel room. -Really? -Yeah. Calm down. Gosh, I swear, that skunk gave me such a headache. She called me, like, so many times. She doesn't have any patience. I know, but relax, just wait. When we get the Wedding of the Year award, everything will be worth it. I hope this Bridezilla skunk will be the makings of us. We've dealt with loads of Bridezillas. They're really something. -She is the worst. -Yes, she is the worst. She's calling. Just answer it and tell her I'm on my way to her room. Yes, hello? How could you hire someone who put this tacky makeup on my face? Geez! We'll fix the makeup later. Mm, cimol! Dig in. Is it good? Tell me, do you run a second-rate wedding organizer place? I paid billions for this. I mean real money, got it? Of course not, it's a first-class organizer business. Look at my makeup. You said it was waterproof! I've never let anyone put this kind of makeup on my face before! Lucinta Luna, the public figure! Trending topic number one! HOW IS IT? I can't believe it! Look how cakey the makeup is! Lucinta, calm down. You should be happy. You will soon be married to Bobby. What! Look! Look at what my friend sent me last night. My future husband had fun with a foreign hooker. It's crazy. Today is my wedding day. My makeup is messed up. Bobby cheated with a foreign hooker. What could be worse than this? That's just a photo from the bachelor party. It's probably a common thing to invite strippers. It doesn't mean anything, so calm down. I'm sure Bobby really loves you. Calm down. "Your team is second-rate, isn't it? Don't you know that I spent billions on this wedding?" I was an inch away from stuffing her mouth with cimol. Calm down, Dara. You can handle this. Wait. How come there are cords on the floor? I said I wanted wireless cameras. Sorry, we're running out of wireless cameras. Stop making excuses! I told you clearly what I needed. I don't think it'll be a problem. We'll still capture the moment. Of course it's a problem! Enough. I don't want to see the cords lying there like that. -Yes, ma'am. -Be careful. Excuse me, miss. Honey. I said it had to be a wireless camera, but they brought the wrong one. I was just annoyed. Oh no! Wait a minute. -Sir, please take our photo? -Sure. I wish your family happiness. May your family be filled with blessings and love. Excuse me. Kirana, do you have something to say to the bride and groom? I am Kirana and we are The Fabulous. One more time, The Fabulous. You see the friendship pin, right? Yeah? OK, so… I don't understand. Why would they invite people like them? Social climbers. What can we say? As you can see, we wear these friendship pins. Oh my God. Miss Ana is here. Ana. Miss, welcome. Was the traffic bad? I know. We looked for them everywhere, from Norway to the Keukenhof, but… It would be nice if the foreground of my magazine photos had tulips. But I have other flowers, miss. Yes. Excuse me. Enjoy the evening, miss. Check it. Is it safe? It's safe. I'm so anxious right now. Just calm down. Once it's done, we won't need to deal with that loudmouth anymore. -Yeah? It's going to be great. -Yeah. This is what we've been waiting for-- the hottest couple of Jakarta, Queen Lucinta and Lord Bobby. Gosh, Lucinta! Dara, Key, please help! What do we do? Bobby! Bobby, sorry… Jak 101 FM plays the best music in Jakarta. Joki 3in1 with Jodi and Vecky here! Did you guys hear about Lucinta Luna? Do you know why the queen's wedding was wrecked? She fell down the stairs on her wedding day. LUCINTA LUNA ROLLING DOWN REACTION VIDEO Poor her, we're so sad for her. And now the wedding organizer has been blacklisted by the whole country. LUCINTA'S WEDDING DISASTER LUCINTA LUNA ROLLING DOWN Yes, but this was the Queen of Bridezilla's wedding. Dara, more bad news. Vony wants us to refund her advance payment. And it's not only Vony. Our clients for next year also want to cancel their weddings. So? This must be because of that skunk, Lucinta. I really want to strangle her. Yes, you can, but Juni, Vero, and Tia all want to cancel. -What do we do now? -For now, just do what they want. But, Dara, we're running out of money. Well, you can use my savings. Key, please take care of everything. Sure. Take it easy there, yeah? -OK? Bye. -Thanks, Key. Why on earth do I have to deal with that unbelievable Bridezilla, Lucinta? Everyone wants their wedding to go well. We don't use "what if" here. How come there's so little left? I ate it. How could you? -Honey. -Yes? Honey! -Do you have a time machine? -Hmm? I don't have a time machine, but I can take you somewhere. Where? You remember my birthday, right? You can use these. No, really, it's OK. I'm fine. I don't want to use your money. And I'm not sure I still want to do it. I'm so tired of putting up with crazies. Not all girls are like Lucinta. Well, anyway, you won't be a Bridezilla, right? Of course not! Your drink, ma'am. Please, enjoy. Thank you for this getaway. I know I must be really annoying. Sorry. but you still have the chance to prepare one more wedding. No, not now. I can't do it. I'm not ready to face any more Bridezillas now. No, she said she won't be a Bridezilla. Yeah? You want to start preparing for our wedding? I'm sorry, I didn't catch that, what? See? I know for sure that Alvin is the right one for you. Where is it? Let me see. It was his mother's. It means you're a very important woman to him. I know. We're doing the next move. Left thigh. What about the office? Lucinta is giving us more than a headache. the media is still buzzing around our office because they demand your confirmation. Sorry. About Lucinta's wedding, She's still stirring the drama in the media. Yeah. What is it? You've gained a million followers on Instagram. I swear, I wish I was in your shoes, with Lucinta keeping on mentioning my name, so I could get that many followers. I could live off endorsements for body slimming and skin-whitening products. Now. Next pose. The person on the left will bend first. Then don't be surprised. I will ask you one question. One more time. that Ana Soedardjo is now following you? Really? I have an idea. Ouch! Miss? If you want to chat, do it in a chat group. I'm sorry. A childhood dream is the crème de la crème when it comes to wedding concepts. A six-tiered wedding cake. And, periwinkle blue as the color tone. My goodness, Dara, this is something I have never seen before. This is really cool. That's it. I don't want to do my own wedding for nothing. Seeing how the media is still curious about me, what if we take advantage of this hype to get our business back on top again? Come again? I don't get it. Well, we will use my wedding to get the Wedding Organizer of the Year award. What do you think? OK, that's fantastic. With this concept, it's decided. I love it, too. I totally agree on this one! This will be really cool. Use the concept for my wedding, too, please. -Dream on! -Dream on! But, we have to see the mother of all weddings first. -Hey. -Mm? Should we really ask for her blessing? Why so scared? Key, Dara. Let's go to the meeting room. I don't care if your father is a congressman. My magazine will never cover a wedding with a glow-in-the-dark concept. Dara. Morning, miss. I am disappointed. -I'm Key. We met at Lucinta's wedding. -Dara? You used cable for that wedding? I know. I told the rental staff to use the wireless camera, but-- Do you even know what year this is? Yes. You should make sure the bride and groom get seated safe and sound from the aisle. You almost got named Wedding Organizer of the Year. I know. I will try to be better in the future. Regarding my visit here… Actually, I'm getting married. I'm not your mother. That's not what I mean, but… I… So, you don't need my blessing? I'm almost flattered. So, here is the thing, Dara is now a trending topic after Lucinta's wedding accident. We want to seize the moment by making Dara's wedding the Wedding of the Year. Just imagine, a wedding organizer who just hit rock bottom, but then manages to organize her own magnificent wedding and claims both the Wedding Organizer of the Year and also The Wedding of the Year awards. Interesting strategy, Rey. Key. Not a celebrity, not the child of a government official. Just an owner of a wedding organizer company who failed. Somehow, she manages to organize a very grand wedding for herself… and becomes the cover of Wedding Star. Wedding Star readers will be inspired. S-sorry? Dara, you're an experienced wedding organizer. You don't even know the standard for rings in Wedding Star? Don't you know about the four C's? but your ring is old-fashioned. But this is… There's no way, ever, that Wedding Star would ever use… a ring like that. This is a legacy from my fiancé's mother. You'll get fat if you keep munching like that. This is baked, not fried. It won't make me fat. Just do what you want. Alvin bought me the whole box. I can't just leave them there. OK. Alvin really cares about me. But I can't ask him to change the ring. His father worked hard for this ring. He saved money for so many years and sold his house to buy this ring for his mother. What should I do? What if… What if I sell my house this time, and then I buy a Harry Winston round brilliant cut ring. I just need to keep it from him. Dara, are you nuts? What the heck? You paid off this house starting from back when we worked at The Marcello right through to when we established our own wedding organizer agency. You can't just sell it. I will only use the ring when I meet Miss Ana. I will use this ring for the actual wedding. We will find another way. -Should I…? -Stop. You should eat, not babble. Eat more. -Give it to me. -You'll get fat. I'm not the bride. I'm not really sure about this song. I poured the water to your sad face Why are you using it as a necklace? It's the trend nowadays. Do you want to show it to Aba? Where is he? -Aba. -Hello, Aba. Dara and Alvin. I've missed you so much, Dara. -Was the traffic bad? -Nope, it was good. Praise be to God. Aba, you painted all of them? Yeah. I'm not Picasso or Van Gogh, or even Van Gug, but my paintings have the potential to be displayed in museums. We take them in in the morning and we take them out at night. It's a joke. You want to talk here or inside? We can talk here, sir. You like it here? -Then we'll talk inside. -OK. Come on. Aba is great at painting. Why did you choose August 29th? Dara… Guess. I don't remember. So I'll have the same wedding date as you and Mom. The same one? Aba, I want to show you the concept for my wedding. Have you two talked about it? So, we will do it in a garden, like this. -This is how it will look. -It's beautiful. Isn't it beautiful? I really like this. I want this to be the Wedding of the Year, so I will invite about 100 editors from Wedding Star, influencers or socialites. So, I need to limit the guests to 200 or 250 for our family members. I will follow what you say. You will invite Wedding Star editorial staff and social media influencers? What for? Because I want our wedding to be a Wedding of the Year candidate. Mom used to say that a wedding is something that only happens once in a lifetime. We have to make it memorable. Right? Dara, Alvin. You better talk it out. We can't let the wish of one person become a problem for the other. Now, just listen to Aba singing for the stars and the moon. Are you angry? Alvin. I'm sorry, but I need this to help my business. I'm not in a rush He has a good voice. Not in a rush What? This is Dara Candranegara's wedding organizer. Gosh. We have collaborated for years. We helped establish your florist shop's reputation. Without us, you'd have ended up as a small flower stall only used to supply funerals! Geez, they hung up. Dara. This is crazy. All our vendors are asking for cancellations. The vendors we want are all booked on August 29th. Not all of them, right? We paid the vendors for Lucinta's wedding, right? I paid them all. Look at Nyinyir Show's post. So, I want to hold the most magnificent wedding for the second time on August 29th. I knew it. Right? Bobby had an affair with Kirana, right? What are you talking about? Go get our coffee! OK. How come we have the same wedding date? It's sabotage. That wench! She's playing dirty. Enough, Dara. -I think we need to find another vendor. -Dara, Key. I can't, Key. This is my childhood dream. I know, but let's face it, we can't book them. New vendors aren't up to my standard. We have to keep trying until we succeed! -Look over there! -What's the matter? Lucinta is over there. Why didn't you say so sooner? I tried to tell you, but… Hey, Lucinta! Calm down! You ruined my business. Now you're choosing the same date for your wedding? You're doing it on purpose, aren't you? I can't believe this mediocre girl has the audacity to scream in my face. You want to know who ruined my wedding? This second-rate wedding organizer did! Watch your mouth! You think I don't know that you're just a social climber? Enough. You have the guts to go against me? -Stop it. -Do you know who I am? Who? I don't care who you are! I don't care about the people around you. You've got no right to be so proud! It's your friends who made you famous. -Why on earth do you brag so much? -You're wrong. I have friends around me because I'm famous. And just so you know, I didn't even know about your wedding. -You want to marry a monkey? -Monkey? Your stubby and boring boyfriend even cheated on you with a stripper! -Don't you dare insult me! -Watch your mouth. Enough. -Stop it, Dara. -I'm going to make this viral! You tried to approach my father, asking for his money for your wedding. Damn you! Shut up! Oh my God! -I'm not in the mood! She's crazy. -Calm down. She showed up from nowhere and annoyed me. I'm annoyed, too. I am also annoyed. Let's watch the telenovela here. Nyinyir Show witnessed Dara the socialite… She reportedly talked to Lucinta about her boyfriend cheating with a stripper. Why does it matter if we have the same wedding date? What's with that question? Nobody will come to our wedding. All the vendors will prefer to be booked by Lucinta. But you can find other vendors. I can't. As for the guests? Everything I have is at stake here, Vin. Ang, turn down the volume. OK. So, how come the wedding is everything for you now? It's not like that. Don't you understand that I have a lot of things at stake? You're eavesdropping, huh? Of course not. This wedding is everything to me. This party is everything. This has to be the Wedding of the Year. I don't like the idea of you using our wedding for your business. If you're just like Lucinta, let's just get married at the Office of Religious Affairs. He's eavesdropping. Alvin. Don't be like that. I'm sorry. I just got carried away. -Don't eavesdrop! -Don't eavesdrop! We both have things to do tomorrow, right? Take a break. I really need a break. I'm turning up the volume, OK? Bye. -Be careful. -Be careful. Key, please check this out. Dara. Dara, it's the revised version. Please check it out. This is not periwinkle blue. I told you specifically. The envelope has to be that color. Didn't you understand? I'll ask the vendor later for the 29th revision. They keep doing it wrong. You don't have to be angry with Aang. You can't blame him for the vendor's mistake. Hello, Miss Ana. No need for small talk, Dara. After my meeting with the board of directors, we've decided that your marriage will be the cover of Wedding Star. You don't have to scream like that. We have to make it the Wedding of the Year, to replace Lucinta's wedding that you ruined before. What's the reason for that? It's due to her husband's scandal, of course. I can't let that ruin our reputation. OK, miss. I won't disappoint you. During the photo shoot, you have to take off your ring. You should make sure important figures and socialites are guests at your wedding. How is it? I think it's done, ma'am. We can turn it on. What did she say? Miss Ana just called me to say… Oh my God. I'm really happy, I can finally sleep peacefully. -No, I don't want to hear it. -Well… No, I don't want to hear it, I hate conditions. Listen! I don't want to. First, just for the photo shoot, I have to change my ring. Secondly, she wants me to invite important figures and socialites from Jakarta. I can see what she's trying to do. OK. First, I am sure all the socialites in Jakarta will go to Lucinta Luna's wedding. She bribed them with first class tickets and five-star hotel reservations, right? What do I do now? Should I… use my insurance money to buy a car for the door prize? That's something Lucinta would do. It's too tacky. Excuse me, Key. This is the list you asked for. OK, thank you. -There's something else, too. -What? Can I go home early today, please? Have you finished your work? Not yet, but I have to hurry to the mall to buy a friendship pin. It's the hype now. It's almost sold out. What pin? Geez, you don't know? The Fabulous is holding a charity event for street children. They made friendship pins. I have to get one. Buy a lot for the whole office. We'll reimburse you later. What? I'll go since the boss said, "OK." Bye, Key. Bye, Dara. I don't like the look on your face. What do you mean? Key. You have to know, the key is The Fabulous. If they agree to be my guests, I'm sure all the socialites in Jakarta will come, too. Dara. Come on, I don't want you to be a social climber. I won't be a social climber. Are you sure? Yes, of course. You won't be a social climber? Not at all. Let's just assume we want to organize an event, so we need influencers, right? Fine. Anyway, we still have to deal with these vendors' dramas. Key, I'm off, I have to see Alvin tomorrow morning. -Bye, all. -Bye. Look ahead. Line up. OK, don't stand alone in the front. Pose in the center with the auntie. One, two. -Use this… -Yes. -Look at the banner. -Look at the banner. -Everyone look at the banner. -Everyone… Wait a minute. Wait. Of course. Who doesn't want to help this fabulous charity? But you had your part, too, so… It's all in the past. The most important thing is to forgive each other. Here is the thing: I'm getting married soon. -Will you come as my guest? -Hmm. I want you to be the host of my wedding. You can invite all of your socialite friends. Because I'm sure all the socialites will be going to Lucinta's wedding. You should know that Miss Ana has decided to write about my wedding and make it a cover. Of course I'll help you. Listen. We're doing this campaign, and we need more platforms. So, I want The Fabulous, all of us, to be your bridesmaids. OK, sure. Sure, my bridesmaids will be my friend, Key, and The Fabulous. Listen. But if she does it with us… You want our help, right? Good afternoon. So? I will use an outdoor venue. There will be a rustic vibe with a lot of trees. I asked you about the guests. I am sure you won't plan a bad wedding for yourself. Yes, I've got the guest list. I've prepared it for you here if want to see it. I got some socialites… Some? Dara, remember our deal. You still need this magazine cover. I understand. I talked to The Fabulous, and they've agreed to come. And don't forget that for the photo shoot, Mr. Yusuf, we will have a meeting at two. -I'm hungry. -Sorry. I'm just a bridesmaid, but I'm only eating veggies and cucumbers so that I can get into my dress. But you're eating carbs. My bridesmaid dress is finished. It's so cute. I'm so happy. The dress is flowy. It's super cute. I can't imagine you'll be angry with me if I wear a dress this beautiful and pair it with boots. The salt! I get how much you want to get married, but that's so unnecessary. But seriously, it's so cute, right? -Key… -I want to wear this every day. Key. You're my best friend, right? You're willing to do anything for our friendship and our business, right? Yes, but not if you ask me to sell my kidneys. Is it OK if… If you aren't my bridesmaid? Of course not. If I'm not going to be your bridesmaid, I can't go to your wedding wearing this. I'm sure I will look cute in this dress, and I want to show off. You can come to my wedding, but not as the bridesmaid. You're kidding, right? I'm serious. I'm sorry, but you can't be my bridesmaid. OK, wait. You're OK with it, right? They requested to be my bridesmaids, and they don't want you to join them. I know it's a bummer. But you're still my best friend. Nothing will ever change… Well, the bridesmaid is supposed to be your best friend, right? Right? The bridesmaid should be the friend who knows you. Who… Who helped you out when your mother was sick. Who held your hair when you threw up. Who held… I helped you finish two gallons of ice cream after you got dumped by your ex. -It's supposed to be that kind of friend. -I know. Not a bunch of unknown, rackety social climbers that you only met yesterday. Yeah, I understand, but this is for our wedding organizer business. You and Lucinta Luna are the same. Now you're just another Bridezilla, like those you've always complained about. You are all the same. It's always me. I'm the one trying to save our business. This business belongs to both of us, but I take care of everything. I got the cover of Wedding Star, even when our business was about to hit the ground. I took care of everything. I tried everything I could to put our name on top again. It was always me, even when you did nothing. You didn't even bother to think about how to fix it, you know that? I handled everything. It's always about you. Are you sure you want to leave? I talked to Key earlier, but… Where are you going? We should talk first. Tell your boss, good luck with the wedding. Move. What do you want to drink? It's on me. Can I have a tamarillo juice? Tamarillo juice? Please, anything extraordinary, OK? I'll call the waitress. Can I have the special guava juice? Thanks. Yes, ma'am. I called Miss Ana, and she's agreed that I'll take care of the photo shoot. Really? She hasn't said anything to me. She's going to call you. You just need to trust me, Wait a minute. Hi, honey. You didn't answer my call. Sorry, I was in a meeting earlier. It's OK. A meeting about what? This is for the Wedding Star photo shoot tomorrow. I see. So, you're with Key? Yes, I'm with Key. OK, tell her I said hi. Just tell me the photo shoot location tomorrow. It's OK if you don't come. I know you must be busy with our honeymoon coming up, right? OK, then. Take care. Let's discuss ideas for the wedding, shall we? Sorry, Alvin called me. Listen, while you were busy answering that call, I got the endorsement for the ring and hand bouquet. So, thanks to me, you don't have to worry about your old ring tomorrow. Miss Ana is going to be very happy. -Let's take a photo. -Yes. It's a video, Dara, come closer. Now time for some pictures, guys! Come closer, Dara. Thank you, Ana. To make you more perfect… Don't be shy. All right, guys, let's start now. One more time. One, two. Good. One more time. One, two. Make the smile bigger. Look here. One more time. One, two. Good. Look here. One, two. Look to the left. One, two. Now, look to the right. Sorry. Honey, wait. It's only for the magazine cover. It's just for this photo shoot. You could've explained it to me, and you could've said no to this photo shoot anyway. We need this magazine cover for… Be strong, Dara. Men don't understand how much weddings mean to us. Let's continue with the photo shoot. Yes? We still need to take some photos of the hand bouquet. You won't leave her, right? I just feel like… Well… From what I can see, she's been under a lot of pressure. But I'm sure you know this wedding has to happen. you should be the one who understands most how important this wedding is to her. -This is her childhood dream. -I know. Maybe… only you can convince her. You could change her back into the Dara that I used to know. I really want to help, but, well, what she did to me hurt me too much. Yes. But even so… Key, just this once. I can't help. But I know who can help Dara. Dara. Aba. How come…? Why are you here? What's with the tears? Are you crying? I'm fine. Why are you crying again? Geez, Dara. You've organized hundreds of weddings, so why are you all tangled with your own wedding? Mom said to me once… Promise me… that your wedding will be beautiful, just like you dream it will be. When you no longer love your husband, you can still revisit that moment. Our wedding was so beautiful… and grand. Everything went how your mom wanted it to. But it had a price. I spent all my savings. I desperately tried to earn money. And the highest price we had to pay was our endless fighting. So, why did you do it? That's love, Dara. There's no logic. It's even more mysterious than the Bermuda Triangle. I thought your mom would be happy. This is my advice. Marriage is not only about the wedding, but about how you build your life after that moment. Your mom and I didn't build anything. I shouldn't have done this. I hope you can do it differently. I know you can get through this. And… I'm sure Alvin… will forgive you. I can't go anywhere if nobody picks me up. Honey, can I have a word with you? I can't do it, can I? The match is too fun, right? Honey, I'm really sorry. I know I was wrong. I only thought about what I wanted. I should have thought of you, too. Shit that was a foul! Stupid referee! That was a foul! -Honey, listen to me. -Yes, dear. I'm sorry, I promise, honey. I'll fix everything. I'll forget about the Wedding of the Year as long as I can be with you. Goal! Good morning. Yes, what's up, Dara? I'm very busy. I want to cancel our deal about my wedding as the cover for Wedding Star. After a long and deep discussion between me and Alvin, we've decided that we want to have a simple wedding. Are you sure it's not a reckless decision because you became a Bridezilla? Yes, I'm sure. OK, then, we don't have any business anymore. But there is one more thing. You are a person I truly admire. I would love to see you as a guest on my special day. Thank you. TO MISS ANA SOEDARDJO This side is for Alvin's family, 20 seats. Replace everything, change everything. Make sure everything looks the same. -It's ongoing. -Oh, is that so? I see. Let's apply the BB cream first, girl. But I don't want it to look heavy. Don't worry, it has a light finish. -Dara. -Yes. It looks like Lucinta Luna's wedding will be the Wedding of the Year. Oh, that's fine. -It doesn't matter. -I'll leave you two. Whatever happens, happens. I'll check things outside. Key. Key. I know I was wrong. I'm sorry. I know I'm too ambitious. But, after you left, I finally understand… what made you disappointed. I didn't think about your feelings. I didn't think about what it meant for you to be a bridesmaid. Really? -May I? -Sure. It's the same. I know the bridesmaid title is more than a title for you. Congratulations. Now, you two are married. It's the meaning of friendship. Thank you, Dad. Thank you. OK. I want you to be there at my wedding. I want you by my side. Look here. OK, everyone. It's time for the speech of our fabulous couple. I feel like I am a lucky man right now with a great woman next to me. And me, I am a truly lucky woman who will be by Alvin's side forever. Thank you, guys, for coming. We still need to hear a few words from Alvin and Dara's father, right? Actually, giving speeches makes me really nervous. But… Dara is our only child. So, Dara's happiness is my happiness. And it's also her mother's, who is no longer with us. This is a wonderful gift for me and her mother. Dara was the inspiration for us to keep fighting the battle when my wife went through some critical periods. But God had another plan, and her mother left us. Then Alvin came, a man who has stood by Dara's side through her difficult times, while she finished her studies and endured the crisis Dara's mother went through. OK, I think that's enough, thank you. -There is still more. -Thank you. It's time for Dara's best friends, The Fabulous, to give a speech. Thank you very much. I'm Kirana, and my friends… Karina, stop! Stop! I'm Kirana, not Karina. First of all. Don't stop me, This is live, I can't say it more than once. We had a deal, honey! I don't care. Let my Dad continue! -Hurry up! -No, why? -This is my wedding. -So? Kirana! I have some important words for the newlyweds. If Formula One is the race for speed, then Formula Madura is the competition for being slow. When you go too fast, tell me. I have the formula. Thank you very much and I'm really sorry. You forgive me, right? -We can talk about that. -Miss Dar! Dara, take a look at Nyinyir Show's post. Geez, Aang. I don't care about that anymore. -What is it? Let me see. -How come you don't care? Aang, Key. We don't need to talk about that here. It's a happy day for Dara and Alvin, so let's just take some pictures. OK, then! Photo time! Your phone! -What are you doing? -We want to be in the photo, too. You guys are restless. That reminds me, how are preparations for the mass wedding in Klungkung? All good. We have a hundred couples. -A hundred? -Mm-hmm. Nobody's going to be a Bridezilla, right? Don't jinx it. Just imagine if you have a hundred Bridezillas. It's still early in the morning, don't ruin the mood. Oh my God, are you kidding me? You're wasting my time! Come on, honey, let's go home. Thank you, be careful on the road. Enough. Second-raters! Come on, honey! What's wrong with her? Just another one. How was the song? We know her type, right? Open it. Look at your face here. This is the certificate. -Let's put this on display! -Yes, let's do that. Go, go, go, let's put this on display! How about we put it over here?
