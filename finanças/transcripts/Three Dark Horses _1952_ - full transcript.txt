I tell you, Jim, we gotta do something about this report. Three of our delegates smell a rat. We'll have to kick them out and get new ones. If Egger isn't elected president, we'll never be able to make that oil grab. You're right. And we've gotta get that oil by hook or crook. What we need are three delegates who are too dumb to think and who'll do what we tell them. Now, where do we find such guys? Come in. Sorry to disturb you, boss, but we gotta clean the joint. It'll only take a few minutes. That's all right, boys, you won't disturb us. Thank you. Right. Right. Oh, come on. Hey, that's the wall the boss wants cleaned. If they're half as dumb as they look, I think we've found our men. Wash the wall and don't spare the water. Right. Get out of here. Get that squeegee and get busy, you porcupine. Ah. Oh. Hey, you. How... Excuse me, Moe, I didn't mean it. Honestly, I didn't. Okay, okay, kid, relax. Nothing's gonna happen. All right. Where's the sponge? Here it is. Oh, thanks. It's a big one, isn't it? Ow, oh, oh. Hey, what's the idea of sponging on me? Why don't you mind your own business. Oh. Oh! See that? Yeah. There. Why you... Oh! He broke it, he broke it. Oh! Hey, you got a hangnail, you know that? Hangnail, eh? Yeah. You didn't get it all, there's anoth... Hey! Hey, hey, your vacuum is sucking up all those papers. Oh, I'm sorry.

Don't worry about it. But my... Shemp, hurry up. I've got it. Here it is, right there. Okay, easy, now. Take it easy. This thing'll never stay on. Hold everything. I'll fix it so he'll never lose it. Okay. Wait a minute! You out of your mind? You wanna punch a hole in this man's toupee? Yow boys are gonna have to pay. I... I know... I never had such a... It's an accident. I tell you, take it nice and easy. Relax. Never. Relax. Never in my life have I had... Here you are, Moe, here you are. Shine up that honeydew. Okay, okay, boys. That's it. There, there. Wh... What's going on? I tell you... Steady now. There it is. Get it working there. Right there. All right, take it easy. Take it easy. Wait a minute, what's going on here? What are you men...? You can't do that. - There you are. - You look beautiful. Your own mother wouldn't recognize you. To coin a phrase, "It's your toupee and you're stuck with it." Get it? Toupee? Stuck with it? There, you idiot. Mm... Oh, those stupid idiots. How dumb can guys be? Relax, Jim, relax. They're just what the doctor ordered. Hm? Hey, boys, come here. Hurry. How would you boys like to make a lot of easy money? You name it, we'll do it. Good. We'd like you boys to be delegates at the presidential convention. You're a cinch, boss. We know all about conventions. We seen 'em on the television. Show him, boys. And pep it up like you're at the convention. We're at the convention, we're at the convention, the halls of bedlam. The people are moving about us, impossible to move. Everyone is shouting and talking hysterically. You have to elbow your way through the crowds. We scream and holler and above the dim roar, our voices blast out: "Vote for the one and only, "That fearless, that honest man of the people, "by the people, for the people, and against the people. So let's vote for..." Moe, who shall we vote for? Vote for that ham... Uh, Hammond Egger. Oh! Go on. The place is a bedlam. Trumpets are blasting. They're off and running around the far turn, White Socks is out in front. Cardinal's a-running close by. The Giant's a-coming up fast. He's coming again and... Hey, hey, hey. You're at the wrong convention. Oh. Hammond Egger wants your vote Shout his praises From your throat You'll eat steak Instead of stew. Five, four, three, two Three, two. Three, two Hold it, hold it. L'm-a demand a recount. What's the delegate's name? Geronimo from Rico Puerto. How many votes? Two. Two? Yeah, two. You got your recount. Get out of here. The convention is getting out of control. Will the sergeant at arms please clear the aisles? Order, order. I'll take a steak and French fries. You're out of order. Get out of here. We're going to this convention like soldiers. Fall in. Right shoulder, arms. About-face. Get over here. Get around, will ya? All right. Now, about-face. Why, you... Come on, come on. Oh, are my feet sore. I'm all in. You know, a guy takes a terrible beating at these conventions. I'll say. Hey, I'm glad room service sent the food up, I'm dying for a cup of coffee. Me too. Pour me some coffee too! Oh, my foot is killing me. Be quiet. Fido, be quiet. Oh, is that foot hot. Ah, ah. Here's your coffee, Shemp. Oh, thanks. Thanks, Larry. You know, Larry, I was just thinking. It's a lucky thing we found out Hammond Egger is a crook before we voted for him. Yeah, and won't Wick burn when he finds out we're not gonna vote for his candidate. Say, boys, we better caucus. Not me. All day long we had a rump session, and now you want me to caucus? I'm gonna have my coffee. Go caucus yourself. Ah. Well, I'll fix that. I got a hot eye. I've heard of hot feet, but never a hot eye. Well, I'll fix this all right. I'll fix this. There we are. That's better. Hey, fellas, I finished my nomination speech. Listen. "Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, fellow degenerates..." Uh... "uh, delegates. "In these sordid and morbid times "when our national economy is at stake and steak is 3 dollars a pound..." "there is a crying need for a man of destiny to step forth. "What our country needs is tax reform, and land reform. "Instead, all we get is chloroform. Shall we continue to remain asleep?" Pay attention. Can't you read the sign? Who's smoking? Get out of here. "Washington freed the country, "Lincoln freed the slaves. Our candidate will free the working man from work." Hey, hey, watch it. Hooray. Thank you, thank you, thank you, gentlemen. "From now on, there will be a two-hour week." Hey! What's the matter with you? Oh, that two-hour week, that got me. That two-hour week, that's for me. Don't be a chump, you chump. You can't believe all that stuff. That's a campaign promise. Come on. Now, then. Yes? Where was I? Oh, yes. "Therefore, delegates, it is my, extreme honor "to nominate as our next president, Abel Lamb Stewer." Abel Lamb Stewer! Hooray! Abel Lamb Stewer! Vote for Lamb Stewer! Vote for Lamb Stewer! Everybody get on the bandwagon for Stewer! Hurrah for Stewer. Go Stewer. We want Stewer. Yay! Vote... Now look at the mess you made. You made it too. Well, so I did. Hey, porcupine, come on, let's clean the place up. I better wash up. Say, it must have been an awful job to cut all these little pieces of confetti up with a scissors. With a scissors? They don't use a scissors, you dope. No? No, a razor blade. Oh. How much money did Stewer's manager give you for your vote? - Fifteen hundred dollars. - So we can buy a yacht. And go fishing. Yeah, you got worms? Yeah, but I'm going anyhow. Say, something smells strong around here. Well, don't look at me, I changed my socks yesterday. Congratulations. Hey, let's eat. I'm hungry. Me too. I could eat a horse. Don't look at me. I said a horse, not a jackass. Go on, got busy. Okay. What are you screaming about? Go on, carve the turkey. I can't. This thing isn't cooked. How do you know? I jabbed it with a fork and it hollered help. Stand aside, lamebrain, I'll carve it. Nyah. It's haunted. What are you trying to do, starve me? Get over there. Why don't you quit playing? Carve that turkey. I'm scared to touch it. Scared? You're crazy. Look at that beautiful breast. No wonder you can't carve it, it's ticklish. Hey, maybe a little seasoning will tenderize it. Pass me the black pepper. That ought to do it. Gesundheit. Hey, fellas, I got an idea. I'll stuff the turkey with crackers, let them soak up the gravy, then we eat the crackers. Smart boy. Let me fix that, you're losing it. Hey, we better hurry because if we don't get there in time, we'll miss the whole... That's funny. I had a cracker in my hand, and before I knew what happened, the... Quit stalling. How about those crackers? I can't do anything. This turkey keeps grabbing the crackers out of my hand. You're crazy. The next thing you'll tell me it's walking. Nyah. Wait a minute, I'll kill it. I'm sorry, Moe. Why, you... Where'd he go? He went thataway. I'll get it. Look out. Hey, fellas, we gotta rush back to the convention. Ow. Come on, we better hurry up. Yeah. Let's go. All right. Come on. Hey, hey, hey, hey. What are doing? What do you mean, what am I doing? And now to recap the voting, this is the 65th ballot and the score is tied between Hammond Egger and Abel Lamb Stewer. There's some excitement on the floor, ladies and gentlemen, just a minute please, until I check on it. Where are those three idiots? Why don't they cast their votes? That'd put us over. The three delegates from the 8th, 9th, and 10th district have just cast their votes. Oh, boy, that's us, we're in the bag. A great upset, a great upset. The three delegates, who were committed to Egger, have switched their vote in favor of Stewer. Stewer is the nominee for president. Those dirty, double-crossing rats. Come on. Wow. Boy, oh, boy, we sure put that over. Yes, sir. We're gonna be set for life. To say nothing of the dough we got. We'll be members of the cabinet. Yeah, I'll make you Secretary of Offence. Thanks. And you, Secretary of the Inferior. Thanks. And I'll be Toastmaster General. If you live long enough. That's a nice crack to make. I didn't say anything. Me either. But I did. Why don't you mind your own business? Then we'll all get... Nyah! You... Come on. Now I've got you. Come on, open up that door. Open up. They won't open it. Let's break it down. One, two, three. We took care of them. Dunk 'em, boys. Get down there. Hey, shouldn't be a total loss, let's take a bath. Okay. Good idea. Okay. Here, here, will you scrub my... Here, take this, will you? All right, right under here. Right there, give it to me.
