I've had another weird dream. I didn't sleep well. You didn't sleep well? I was running away. Again. And I could see... three huge statues... of Buddha, lying at my feet. Their expressions were great... they looked very kind. Behind the statues there was a door. And when I opened it... I looked around and saw... arms, legs and heads, the size of the statues. They're blue, red, you know... the primary colours. Everything's scattered about on the floor; it's like a maze. Too bad, isn't it? Awful, don't you think? - Are you tired? - Yeah. - Are you going to shave? - I'll shave there. - Do they shave you? - No, I have to shave myself. - It must be awful to be shaved by someone else. - I can imagine. Back to work... how boring. How fucking boring! Are you leaving? - Give me some money. - Fine. How much? Let's see... Pass me the purse. - Do you want something? - Hmm? - Do you want something? - Something to eat. - What? - Anything. - Savory or sweet? - Whatever. I'm going. Have something for breakfast! Bye, bye! It's too dull... - Yes. Don't you have anything else? - Yes, just a minute. Excuse me. This one has a summery feel to it... Yes... And this one has buttons. They're part of the design. - It suits you great. - Really? It's very flowing. - Yes. - Pretty much. And it's perfect for your height. - Would you like to try it on? - Can I? I'd like to. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. What's the matter? What? Oh, nothing. I'm not feeling very well. I know how it feels. Do you, Yu? What? - When you don't feel like doing anything. - Of course. "Boss, this plan won't work. It's not realistic." "Boss, this plan won't work. It's not realistic." - "Boss, this plan won't work..." - Mr. Kuroe... - There are some changes to the scene. - Fine. After scene 27, Maeda will go to Osaka. - Okay. - And your scene has been deleted. It's gone. I'm sorry. - We'll be calling you. - Sure. - Thank you very much. - Thank you. Thank you. How did it go? - How did it go? - Fine, I guess. "Boss..." "Boss"? "Boss, this plan won't work. It's not realistic," I say. What's it like? - What's the plan like? - I don't know. I say that at the beginning. "Boss, this plan won't work... "It's not realistic." - Are you tired? - No. Boss... Boss... I'm hungry. Boss... please... - A salad? - Fine. What do you want? Mayonnaise? Boss... it's up to you! What was your alias? "Kuroalien". Kuroalien! "Get out and act"! Something's just gone wrong. Hey! But what...? It's horrible. - I'll improve it. - No, stop it. - Not yet. - Stop it. - Wait. This one, this one... - Ouch! - It doesn't hurt. - So cute. - Stop it. Stop it! - What else, what else? - Stop. I said, stop it! It's over! Is it itching you? Can you do it? Have you taken it off? You know... What are you doing tomorrow? Are you angry? Are you going to bed? Kei... Hello? Hi, it's me. Can you hear me? Where are you? Right now? Well... I'm not sure! Listen, could we meet up today... for lunch? Sure. But... I only have half an hour. - Fine. - Fine? So... I'll come. Will you? Good. At the... Moon. Do you know where it is? - Yes. - At one. - At one, at the Moon. - OK? Yes. See you later. Sorry for the delay. "Sorry for the delay." I have ten minutes left. Ten minutes is fine. - No, it's not fine. - I don't have a watch. - Then buy yourself one. - Eh? Buy yourself one. I don't like them. It's not about that. You don't understand. It's not necessary. You're always late. Yu... do you want to get married? What's so funny? Do you want to get married? - And? - Do you want to get married? - And what else? - What do you say? And you say... Let's get married and be happy. - And then? - What? The next line? There isn't one. There isn't one? Hey... if something's wrong, just tell me. - There's no line. - That's not what I meant. I won't recite more lines of scripts. Is something wrong? Nothing. That's not the truth. Don't be so serious. Marry me. You should leave. - I'm leaving. - I don't need money. I said, no! Fine. I'm leaving. Kei has proposed to you... why haven't you answered? I meant to... but I couldn't get the words out of my mouth. Why not? I don't understand. Why don't you want to get married? Yes... I can't understand why he wants to get married. I don't really think he wants to. Kei? Then what does he mean? He seems to be thinking of something sad. Do you know what he might be thinking of? What? I don't know. You don't know what? Will you ask Kei? Yeah, maybe... Why he wants to get married? Yes, but I don't know how to ask him. What are you doing? Kei, what are you doing? What are you doing? - I fell asleep. - There? I'm sorry. Are you OK? - What were you doing? - I was sleepy. - It's so cold. - Of course it is! You're so silly. Are you OK? Leave them. It's OK. I'll do it. Leave them to me. It's strange... you never help. I wanna go to the beach. Don't you? To the seaside? Do you remember when the water was over our heads... and we played dead? We pretended to be drowned. Did we? Then we went fishing, and we ate the weirdest fish. It was greenish and tasted hellish! - I wanna go. - Is that what we did? Can't you remember? You're hurting me. What's wrong? What? Something's going on. Let's go on with the chat, right? Why don't we get married? I don't know! Say something. Can't you hear me? I don't know. You do... What? You do know. I don't know! Forgive me, forgive me... forgive me, forgive me... You're late! - You're late. - I know, just let me light up. - You're late and you're smoking? - Have you been here long? - I'm sorry. - It's pointless. Long time, no see! How are you doing? How are you? What's the matter? Aren't you happy to see me? I wanna go to Italy for a month. - To Italy? - Yes. - But not to study? - To have fun. I wanna go. Can I? - You're working. - That's true. You look well. Have fun? In Italy? It was your fault... but it made me feel good. I wanted to thank you. Now I'm dating an older man. I'm fed up with young folk... they only think about themselves. I'll leave them to someone like you. I guess that since then... everything's going good for you. I wonder what he sees in you. Don't play games with me! What? What? Do you wanna say something? Say it, I'm listening. I'll never see you again. Take care. - Wow! It's been ages! - Hi. How are you? - Are you leaving? - Yes, see you. See you soon! Yu? Yu, what's wrong? Yu, what's wrong? - You're drunk. - Hi. I've seen her here before. - Have you? - Yes. - She knows Kyoko. - What? Is she a friend of Kyoko's? Who's Kyoko? What's he talking about? Her name is Yu. - So you're not Kyoko? - Excuse me? Kyoko used to come here... She would get into all sorts of trouble. She used to steal money from the guys. She got into a fight with... Hello? Hi. It's me. - Can you hear me? - Yes. I'm sorry I shouted at you. Where are you? Once more, I don't know! You're so stupid. Look... if something's wrong... just tell me. I will. I will tell you. I'm sorry. - This is wonderful! - How do you like it? - It really suits you. - Does it? - Do I look nice? - Amazing. Really? It's perfect for you. You look like a doll. The pattern goes very well with your hairstyle. It accentuates your character. The design is simple and it enhances your figure. - Does it suit me? - Absolutely. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you very much. - Please come again. - Are you going somewhere? - Just to have a ride. Thanks! Yu? Is something wrong? - No, I'm fine. - Are you sure? You may need a rest. What are you doing? What are you doing? Waiting for you. - Will you come in? - Yes. - Are you tired? - Yes. - It's hot. - Yes. Very hot indeed. That's better. First of all... forgive me, I feel terrible. - Can you forgive me? - Yes... but not completely. Since my work hadn't been going too well... I was taking it out on you. So? So? What...? What?! So now... well, I'm sorry. What? What about getting married? I still want to. You said you'd explain why. I want to, and that's that. I feel like doing it. Let's get married. Something... has affected you, hasn't it? Let's get married. - Explain it. - We could be happy. - Explain it. - Couldn't we? - Something's happened to you. - I'll find a job... maybe as a salesman. But what will I sell? I'll get a job, and I'll come home exhausted. And you'll say: "A bath or some dinner?" And I'll say: "I may have a bath." The contrary would be fine too, wouldn't it? Or just the opposite: you work, and I'll take care of our home. - I'll cook, clean, do the washing... - Just tell me why... You'll come home saying: "I'm tired." Me: "Are you?" "The bath is ready. Would you like to have dinner first?" We'll talk about the neighbours... - I could cook, if I read something. - Stop it. I could clean too. I'm tired, shut up! I could do it. Look: clean the room! What's wrong? What's wrong? Stop! Stop! What's happened to you? Tell me what's happened. What's happened? What's happened? What's happened? - Nothing. - You're lying. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'll tidy it all up. What a mess. We have to... pick all this up. No worries. Just pick it all up. We have to pick all this up. Let's pick it all up! What a mess. We'll pick it all up and everything will be in order. No worries. I wish you luck with your work. It's just a job, take it easy. No worries. Never mind what you do. You don't have to be an actor. - Anything will be fine. - What? Acting is not important. You can do something else, if you really mean to find a job. Never mind, I will work. You won't... - I'm leaving. - No. No. Why? - Give me some money. - I don't have any. - Give me some money. - I don't understand... - Give me some money. - What? Give me some money, Yu! Give me some money, Yu! How funny! - Give me some money. - You're so funny. Give me some money and don't laugh. - Why are you laughing? - How funny! Very funny. Give me some money. - Very funny. - You'll work, won't you? And I'll be a beggar. - Give me some money! - It's a role, isn't it? A character. Very funny. Don't you play with me. Don't you play with me! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Hey, forgive me. Wait. Where are you going? Where are you going? What should I do? Where are you going? Kei! Kei! I've always wanted to be an actor; I've worked for that. But somehow... Somehow... I don't think it's all that anymore. The difference between... what I used to think... that acting should be, and the result... of what I've been doing... it's pretty big. I guess I haven't achieved too much. So I thought... that I should give it up. But then... what happened was... that there was nothing left to do. I don't think that marriage... will change anything. But if I don't get married... I won't be anything. It's the only place to start from. Hello? Kei... Kei... Where are you? I'm not sure... I have nowhere to go. Come home. Come home. Do you wanna marry me? Do you? Let's get married. Let's get married. I'm such an asshole. - How many of them are coming? - Three. Three? - Isn't that OK for you? - What? - Are you worried? - Just nervous. There aren't enough plates. Isn't it too much? There's more here. It's too much. You don't need to throw that away. Yu, Yu! What's wrong with you? What's wrong? Yu, Yu! What's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong? No! Yu! Yu! Are you alright? Are you alright? Are you alright? Are you alright? Are you alright? I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. What happened? What happened? I'm fine. - Better? - Yes. I'm sorry. Hi, Yu! I'm coming. I'm coming! Hi, if you don't mind... - How are you doing? - Fine. It's been a long time. Come on in. - Thanks for coming. - Are you OK? Yes, I'm fine. Come on in. I'm fine. Come in, please. Thanks for inviting us. This is for you. - You seem to have been at it. - We weren't. - Hello! - How are you? Fine. - How long has it been? - A year, more or less. So long? Take a seat. - What's this? - Spaghetti. - So much sauce! - We can have seconds. I'm still cooking. Take a seat. Surely, you've already had lunch? - Would you like some salad? - Yes, thanks. We're sorry we couldn't help. The important thing is that you've come. Thanks. How's everything going? - Well... - Getting by? - Fine. And you? - Very well. - And you? - The same. If you don't mind... could you leave? Yu, do you agree? Have you had a fight? Are we going? - Yu... - Yes? - Are you OK? - Yes. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. All right, Yu? Take this. OK, Yu? We're going. See you soon. - I'll call you. - Fine. I'm fine. No worries, we'll comeback another day. I'm sorry. You can leave, no worries. I'm sorry about this. Are you OK? - We're getting married. - What? We're getting married. Well... Nothing, nothing. - Really? - No. - That's great! - Congratulations. What's the matter? - Yu?! - Are you OK? Yu! I know. Stop it, please. We're leaving, right? I'm sorry. Yes, let's go, let's go. Take care. Come on, let's go. - I'm sorry. - It's OK. See you. Goodbye, Yu! See you. Bye, bye! Yu, Yu... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - How does it suit me? - Wonderful. - Really? It matches the pants and this is your size. - How do you feel? - Fine. - Perfect. - Maybe a belt... - It would look nice. - Can I help you? - It's not necessary. - Well, maybe you could go... - What? To the dry-cleaner's. - Really? - Yes. I know three places. Go straight on and then turn left. It's just in front of the florist's. - All right? - Yes. - Are you sure? - Yes. - Could you buy some detergent? - Yes. What type? - What? - What type? - Washing powder. - Yes. Take this. - Fine. Give me some money. - Oh, yeah... - Thanks. See you later. - Buy something for yourself. Bye, bye. Thank you. - Hi. - Hi. What's the matter? Yu... she's disappeared. Hi. Oh... - Tea with milk. - Fine. What do you mean? Well... it was about ten days ago. - Ten days? - She hasn't called me. What about her parents? No. She hasn't... called them. Apparently... - But she did call her work. - And? Just to quit. - So she's not working anymore. - No. What can she be doing? Well... I don't think anything serious has happened to her. But, ten days... What can she be doing? - That's what I'm wondering. - I'd like to know, too. Why? It has to be my fault. Excuse me. Thank you. I don't know anything. Nobody does, or else I would have heard. I'm going. If you don't mind... - could you cover mine, too? - What? I'm sorry. I have no money. Here it is. Thank you. She hasn't called me. Will you call me if you learn something? I guess it should be the other way round. You call me. Please. - Excuse me? - Call me. She's gone ten days without calling me. You were with her. If I had been there... maybe I could have done something. I don't know, but... Sorry, I didn't mean to offend you. I'm not offended. You were with her. That's what I thought the other day. I wonder... I don't understand... I have to do something. Do you feel something for her? I don't know. What will you do? Go home, to sleep. In that apartment? Don't you have any other place to go? Well, actually... I don't feel very comfortable there. But it's the only place I can think of. Yu! You've caught me unawares. I thought I'd never see you again. Can I ask you something? Why did you leave? It's alright. - I just wanted to disappear. - What? What? I just wanted to disappear. What? I wanted to disappear. I've got a job. You must have guessed. Are you OK? Are you OK? It's weird... the job, I mean. It's not bad. What about you? Not bad. No? Well, maybe a little. Will you come back home with me? Probably you won't believe it... but I have changed. Let's go home. No? I can't go back. - What? - I can't. Oh... Well, I'm leaving. Kei... Kei... Kei... Why are you worried? I'm not Yu anymore. I'm not Yu anymore. Don't worry. I'm not worried. Aren't you? It's just that... it's hurting me. I'm sorry. Thanks for everything. First! Run, run! You've almost reached the base! Your old life, working at the boutique... how do you feel about it now? I depended on people... On many people? I thought people depended on me. But I liked that people... trusted me. And not anymore? Won't you go back? What do you think... of Kei? I like him very much. Will he get along OK by himself? He may stay alone... or he may meet someone.
