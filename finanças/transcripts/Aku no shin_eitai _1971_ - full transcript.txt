A TOEI PRESENTATION Five minute warning till next race. Excuse me! Let me through, you idiot! Get out of the way! Move! Move! Move away, move away! Hey, get in line! If I get in line, I can't buy the tickets. Come on, get out of the way! Hey, old timer, do that later. I said later! Hey, 50 tickets on 3-8. Hurry it up! Harada, what's the return on 3-5? 3-5? Probably 12 or 13. That's not bad. Move, move! Boss, I got the tickets. - Here. - Buy another 50 tickets on 3-5. The window's closing. Idiot! Place the bet. Break the window if you have to. - Take it. - Yes, sir! Ouch! - Damn you! - Tatsu! Yes? Tell Shun we're leaving when this race is finished. Huh? Where did he go? - Shun. - Huh? You're sure this time? Of course. There's always an upset in the final race. So, 4-7 is a sure thing. You've been saying that since the first race. That's why I bet 100 dollars on each 4-7 ticket. Thirty on each ticket. That means 3.000 dollars is mine. The 500 I borrowed? You'll get 1.000 dollars back. Hey, that's the collection money for the bar. - I need it back. - I know that. Don't worry about a thing. Look, they're off! Go! Go! Here comes 1.000 dollars. 4-7, go! Let's go! Go, go, keep going! How's it going? Keep going, like that! That's the way! I won. 1-2. So, 4-7 came in, right? Nope, it was 1-2. - Shun... - What am I going to do now? Hey, hey! Listen, next time, I'll quadruple the loan, okay? Are you kidding? Give me back my money. It's all luck. Can't be helped. Hey! See ya! - Hey, you! - Give me back the money! You can't get rich if you stick to the rules. You've got to use your head. Idiot. You only use your head to seduce women. It's their fault if they're gullible. Women are greedy. When I said I'd double their money, they were game. But they don't know how to buy betting tickets. So, I told them I bet on horses I knew wouldn't come in. Then, I hide the sure thing in my pocket. That's how you profit from horse racing! You're sure of yourself as usual. But that's how we three can go out on the town. That's true. Not a glimmer of hope. Women sure are poor creatures. Right! Hey! Toyo, come here! What's up, Brother? - We have a job, get in. - Sure! We're here. Kawasaki Sauna, Ryugu? Look at all those pretty flowers. They're brave to put out flowers without the Anesaka family's permission? Either that or they're really stupid. All right. They're gonna pay dearly for this. Hey, don't hurt anyone. Just be really obnoxious. - Understand? - Yes! - Let's go. - All right!

We're in the money. Got three notes. - It's time to get out of here. - Let's go! Hold on. What do you want? You forgot something. Forgot? What did we forget? Take this noxious smoke with you. What'd you say, damn you? Hey! Shut up, you punk! Huh? - What the hell... - I'll do it. Which family do you belong to? Hey! We're not afraid of you. Remember that! Damn you! You've done it! Stop! - I'll kill you! - No, Toyo! An ambulance or a hearse... Which one shall I call? You must be Anematsu family's interns. Huh? Intern? Yes! Then, take me to Anematsu. Idiots! How dare you make me lose face? Boss... We're sorry. This guest used to be my brother yakuza. When he comes to visit, you try to cause him grief. How could you? I had no idea he was that important. - Sorry. - Shut up! All three of you, I want your little finger. Cut it off and apologize to my brother. It's an order. Do it! Don't do it. There's no point. But, Brother, it's a token of my apology. It's okay. What good will their fingers do me? Sir. We're truly sorry. Now, Brother, have one. Anematsu, you seem to be doing well. There's a limit in this godforsaken place. Please stay a while, Brother. - I really can't. - It's no problem! We're really close. You can stay as long as you like. Anematsu, I have a favour to ask you. What? Loan me some money and a couple of men. I'll do anything you ask, Brother, but... What are you going to do? I won't cause you trouble. Lend them to me without asking questions. But it's not like I have a lot of spare cash. Anematsu. I'll make it worth your while. I'm telling you to run! Run, damn you! Damn it, run a bit slower, you punk! Here we go! Give me a smoke. Ouch, ouch! Hey, that was hot! But what about last night? When he suddenly said to cut my finger, I thought I was going to die. Yeah! We owe it to the guest that we still have our fingers. - Right! - I don't like that bastard. Why not? He puts on airs like he's somebody. He looks formidable and stylish to boot. Idiot, you don't have to praise your opponent. Why not? He's a yakuza. We just have to train harder, right? - That's right. - Yeah! Are you kidding? We clean toilets and pull weeds every day. We feed the tropical fish. Then, we have to take these fat dogs for a walk. - You call that training? - Yeah. You have a point there. This isn't training for a yakuza. We're not getting paid, either. It's not a good deal. We're doing a kid's job! They said if we can't do what kids and women do, we can't be a real yakuza. I want to do something big and be a real man! Hey, Toyo, the boss always says, a yakuza's life begins and ends in endurance. No way! I've had it! Brother? How long are you going to endure this? You're thirty and you're still not one of them. You fool! You've just joined! Don't talk big to me! Brother Tatsu... You've got to grin and bear it. Got that? I'm sorry, Brother... Hey! The boss wants you three. Sit down. Don't you guys want to be real men? Huh? Yes... Don't you want the family badge? Yes, of course. - You want money, too? - Yes. All right, then I'll release you from your family oath. As of today, our family ties are severed. - Got that? - Boss, that's too much. Boss... Boss! I know how you feel. As of today, my guest will be taking care of you. Go with the guest to Tokyo. Tokyo? - All three of us? - That's right. My guest's orders are your parent's orders. Remember that in Tokyo and do your best, all right? - Yes! - Yes! Guest, I'm counting on you! - Thank you. - Thank you. Tokyo's a big and cool place. It's not like Kawasaki. - That's right. - There are so many women here I'll be tired all the time. You should talk! You're not the only one who's popular with women. Hey, don't be jealous. I'll send one your way, so wait for it. Are you kidding? I have a girl waiting for me in Shinjuku. I don't believe it. What's her name, then? - Yeah, tell us. - Well, she's... Her name is Yuriko. What? Yuriko? Yuri, as in white lily? I have high standards, unlike you, you know. Then, let's see your standard, right, Brother Tatsu? Let's see it, yeah! - Sure, don't be surprised. - Yeah, I look forward to it. - Here we are. - Okay! Welcome. Pops, is Mr. Kuki here? You're Kawasaki hoodlums. What? You call us hoodlu-- ouch! - He's waiting upstairs. - How do we get there? Let's go. - Toyo Eto! - Tatsu Saira. - Shun Ogawa. - We're all here. We're coming in. Why do you think you're here? I said why are you here? Why? We're here to work. Idiots! It's not like you're here chasing women. So, why did you come in such a flashy car? Well... we thought the car would come in handy... It's old, but it runs good. - Get rid of it. - What? We're in the city. We don't use cars to do jobs. Yes, we're sorry. - Sit down. - Okay. Pops, they're Toyo, Shun and Tatsu. They'll be staying here from now on. Look, just acting tough won't cut it. You've got to have guts, or you won't be able to make it. Yes. He's Masajiro Hamamura, used to be a yakuza. Now, the owner of a coffee shop. There're 10.000 dollars here. Spending money for you. Boss, please give us the family oath. No need for that. You can call me Brother. But, Boss... Let's talk about work. This town is Todo family territory. We're going to take it from them. You guys must have presence and become somebody there. Your lives are on the line. On the other hand, you won't want for money. Now is your chance. If you don't like it, leave now. Brother, I want to be a man. - Please take us on. - Please! This is our family badge. We're Shinjuku Shin'eitai. Once you receive it, you have to protect it to the last man. Understood? That's our law. - Got it? - Yes! Hey, that's the Todo family office. - Wow! - It's huge! Hey, look! That must be the family boss. He's got real presence. As befitting a Shinjuku boss. Damn, you just watch! Oh, welcome. Are you alone? No, as you can see, we're three. We were waiting for you. Please come with me. They were waiting for us! - Tatsu! - Yes? Who the hell is that? Brother. So, it seems, it's not you women wait for. Same name, different guy, Brother Tatsu. Damn. - This is for you, Mama-san. - For me? This is for you, Kazumi. It's a ruby. - And Misha... - What about me? "You are a very beautiful girl", so here you have. I'd rather have cash. She's a strange one. All right, this is for those who didn't get a gift. - Wow! - Here! - Thank you. - Thank you. I'm going to leave now. Aw, don't leave! My American yachting friends are here. They're waiting for me at a Ginza club. See you. Talk to you later. Excuse me now. Watch where you're going! I'm sorry. Mind your manners, people. First of all, black suits are so pass√©... You should be wearing Cardin, or a casual look like me, or the girls won't look twice at you. I mean, only bumpkins wear snakeskin belts. You have to watch those things. You're still young. Hold it, mister! Hey, if you pick a fight with me, Japan's bancho juvie leaders will come after you. Bye. Wait for us. So, that's how to be popular with women. Whose family does Bancho belong to? He's not yakuza. It must be the Shinjuku leader of juvenile delinquents. Hey, Sis, come here. Hey, hey! I want to speak to the Mama-san. - That would be me. - What? Oh, that's good, then. Have a seat, please. Welcome. What can I do for you? This is a nice bar. Us three are Shinjuku Shin'eitai. - Remember us. - Shin'eitai? Simply put, we're yakuza. Is that so? Please make us your regular bar. Hey, this is for you. This much, is it okay? Don't be shy, keep it. There's lots more where that came from. Thanks so much. Send over some pretty girls. Of course. Have a nice time. Okay? Okay? She's got class. No one like that in Kawasaki, right, Toyo? Toyo! Yeah... Brother Tatsu, wanna dance? Let's go, let's dance! Can we sit with you? What do you want? Do you have a cigarette? Here. Not those. The other kind. Other? - Marijuana. - Of course not. Then, buy me some. How much? 50 dollars a cigarette. 100. If you sleep with me, I'll buy it for you. If you give me 100 dollars more, I'll take you to a great place. - Shun. Brother. - Huh? - I'm leaving. - Where are you going? Somewhere nice. See you later. Hey! Hey, Toyo! Let's go, too. Don't go. Have another drink. All right, I'm going to drink all night. Yeah, bring some sake! You might be rich brats. Don't be stupid! We are Shinjuku Shin'eitai. What's that? Sounds like a right-wing group. Don't you know? We're yakuza. But we're no ordinary yakuza like the Todo family. That's right. It's a big problem that the Todo group, who are like insects, are acting big here in Shinjuku. Believe me when I say it! I'll take some bug spray, and... Huh? You bastards! Take that! Hey. Hey. I don't care what you are. How dare you throw your weight around. Welcome. Hello again. You're Mama-san. Have a good time. Hey, you. Don't just stand there. Come sit by me. Why is that woman here? Mama's also the sponsor of this marijuana party. This is more her regular job. She sure is a shrewd businesswoman. Hey, why don't you try one? - It's dangerous, isn't it? - Nope. You're going to feel good. Like being on a cloud. Kazumi, can I have some? No way, buy one yourself. When I work, I'll pay you back. You haven't paid me for the last one. Please, just one? I'm begging you. Get away! Hey, you can have mine. No, that's not what she wants. It's snow. - Snow? - Heroin. Heroin's expensive and hard to get. A drug addict, huh? - Give it. - Stop that! Shut up! Yuriko! Hey, wait! Yuriko, it's you! Get away from me. What are you doing here? Shut up! Let me go! Let me go, I say. Yuriko. Congratulations on your new job. I can't believe it's been seven years. I went to Nagoya. I went to Tokyo. It's good to see you. You were surprised, right? No, you haven't changed a bit. You're still beautiful. But I have changed. It's me who's changed. Got fired from the dry cleaning store. Spent a year and a half in juvenile detention. Now, I'm a yakuza. Although I'm the lowest newbie. I hate the yakuza. I was raped by a yakuza, and before I knew it, he had me taking drugs. That's when I started going to places like that. The Todo family? Damn them! They made me do drugs, too. Can't you stop? No way. I go crazy if I don't take it. I take johns to buy drugs. I pick up johns, so I can do drugs. I do drugs to pick up johns. Now I don't know which comes first. Stop doing drugs. It's too late. - What are you...? - Don't! Yuriko... Please stop! Okay? Yuriko. I understand you haven't been working lately. I don't feel well. Are you kidding? You promised you'd start working again, so I had the drugs delivered. Look at you! You've hardly worked at all. I can't give you 2.000 dollars worth of drugs for nothing. I'm sorry, Mama-san. I'm not a soft touch! - Damn you. Work, you bitch! - Brother! - There's a problem. - What? Hey, what do you want? Hey, thanks for taking care of my friends last night. Hey, and whose family are you? Listen up. We are Shinjuku Shin'eitai, feared even by the Shinjuku police. This is payback. Prepare yourself! All right, remember this. This is what we do. Beat 'em up! Any more bets? Place your bets. Did you place your bets? I need two more. Any more bets? Just one more. Any more? Well, one more bet? One more. All right, we have a game. Open. God, it's pouring out. My suit's ruined. Who are you? –ù—ñ. Hi. - Welcome. - Hi, Owner. - What'll it be? - Can I borrow a towel? I'm soaked. Brother, asthma? That's not good. Oh, by the way, here's my card. Sorry it's wet. - Insurance guy. - Right. Naniwa Life, Sanemaro Ayanokoji. The main office is in Osaka. Brother, have a seat. Now then, what protects you through rain and wind? That's insurance. This is insurance. Look at the pamphlet. Here you go. I heard that here in Shinjuku there were fearless men. You're the Shin'eitai, right? - You have your badge. - Don't touch. Can't do the job if you're smart or dumb. Even more if you're in between. That's what it means to be a man. Forsaking territory and love with a cute girl. I love yakuza. But you have your job cut out for you. If the boss orders it, you have to agree even if he's wrong. Am I right? If he orders you to kill, you have to do it. But you might get killed instead. But it's too late for your wife and kids... - You have a wife and kids? - No. I know you don't. What do you say? I can start you with 10.000 dollars and go upwards. The company's huge, 69 stories. Won't you buy my insurance? Buy some insurance and become a man, brother. - I am invincible. - Invincible? I hear that often. I tell them to read this article. Look. "74 yakuza members arrested". "The one who said he was invincible was the first to get killed". - I didn't need to hear that. - But it's true. "Bancho group investigated". They're a bad lot. You may not want to hear this, but since 1945, 1971 yakuza have been killed. That doesn't look good at all! Hey, hey. Don't blow your nose on my pamphlet. What's with this? Oh, you have to buy insurance right away. Your sinus condition is really bad. Damn you, won't you ever shut up? What a fool. "Can't do the job if you're smart or dumb". "Even more if you're in between". "That's what it means to be a man"! I forgot my briefcase. Anyone know someone who wants insurance? - Shut your trap! - Ouch! Brother! Going out? Brother, it's raining outside. Use this. Don't go picking fights around town. I'll give you orders about that, all right? - I'll see you. - Take care. Hardship's made him really dignified. Pops. Is it true Brother was big around Shinjuku? He was strong, people respected him more than Todo. What did he do to put him in prison? Eight years ago, the Doi family ruled here. He and Todo were the managers. One day, Todo, who had a grudge against Kuki, killed their boss Doi, and made it look like Kuki did it. - Brother, a word? - What is it? Boss wants you. - Now? - Yes. He told me to fetch you. I'll be right back. Boss. Boss! Boss? - Boss. - Kuki. How dare you kill the boss? I didn't do it! Shut up! You framed me! Stop! Come quietly. Todo! You! Come... come! What a dirty bastard. Todo's a bastard. That's yakuza for you. Yakuza obligation and honour are just appearances. So, Todo inherited the family and created the Todo family. He also took Kuki's woman and made her his. That's Mops' Mama-san. What? That looker? She's now rotten to the core. Brother really got the short end of the stick. Does Brother know? When he came out a month ago, he only thought about getting even with Todo. Get out of the way! Todo pachinko? Don't make me laugh. Move out of the way! Come here, you punk! Go to hell, you bastards! Let me go! You bastard! Get them! Idiots! So, who are they, this Shin'eitai? Well, they're just hoodlums, but something's not right. How? They only go after places in our territory. Hm... and? You just watch silently as they do that? No, it's not like that. But they're really quick-footed. Maybe there are just soldiers. Soldiers? Someone's using them to get my territory. Who's that? He'll make himself known soon. Damn it. They're making fun of us. Morishita. Before he appears, get them. Who is it? Who are you? You! What are you doing here? I came to see the woman who betrayed me. Who betrayed who? You left me alone for eight years. And now you come to see me? How selfish. I was really in love with you at that time. But you left me and went away. I was heartbroken. I'm just a woman. I was lonely. It that all you have to say? What are you doing? Let go of me. Look. It's the same tattoo as yours. When I heard you became Todo's woman, I didn't forget you, who had the same tattoo. But not anymore. Yuriko! Yuriko. What's the matter? Yuriko? Toyo... I... I tried to quit... drugs, that is. Then, you...? You told me to quit, right? So... So, I... Hey, Yuriko! Look at me. Yuriko... Toyo, make love to me! Please, take me! Make love to me, Toyo! I'm so happy. Yuriko... Look outside. The neons are pretty. This sky was my downfall. Shinjuku's sky had no stars. Because I'm under this sky, I ran to drugs. Enough. Drugs are in the past now. Yes, it's finished. It feels like a dream, being with you like this. I want to see the skies of Goto back home. When this job ends, let's go back to Goto. We'll go together. You and I. For real? Yeah, for real. We did it! We did it. We did it. We did it! Hello, Boss. Good morning. How did this happen? We've been punked. How can you let a nobody do what he wants in my territory? Why can't you catch them? - Well, we tried, but they're quick... - Shut up! It's just a couple of hoodlums. I don't care how you do it, find them! - Yes! - Yes! No need to go looking. I've come to you. - Kuki. - Don't move! Have you forgotten Shinjuku Shin'eitai? I don't think they have. Don't try anything funny. Or else, your boss dies. I didn't have time to pay respects now that I'm out. Sorry about that. So, the Shin'eitai was you. So? What are you going to do to me? This time, I want you to die. That's what I want to say, but that solves nothing. But I intend to take your territory. - You can't. - Shut up! I'm going to make you pay for eight years ago. For starters, hand over the deed to Club Mops. It's not here. Don't lie! It's okay, if you don't want to. How about it? I want an answer! All right. You win. Another thing. You broke the yakuza code. What's that? You know what happens to a yakuza who takes another yakuza's woman? I don't want her back. Instead, I intend to take all your territory. Got that? - Toyo? - Yeah? We're leaving. How did it go? Not bad. - Hey. - Yes. You did good, Kuki. Of course. Todo's no match for Brother. What about Todo? I've never seen anyone so scared, right? Damn right. He got a nosebleed and his legs were jelly. But think... they'll come for revenge. What can they do? They're impotent. Brother? Todo will be gunning for you. Be careful when you go outside. - Got that? - Yeah. Boss? Boss? They went into a coffee shop called Robo. - Robo? - Yes! That's Hamamura's place. - Are you sure? - Yes. Hello? Hello? Is that you? It's Kaori. I'm sorry. I don't have any right to say this to you now, but I want to see you. Please, see me. Just once more. I'll regret how we parted. So, please come see me. Please, will you? I'll be waiting. Tonight. Please come. Hello? Hello? Hello? Here you go. You always come from the bath so early. Are you going out, Brother? Where's Toyo and Shun? They must be playing pachinko. You make a good barista. Really? But I can't make great coffee like Pops. Of course not. Experience counts. Pops, a word? If I don't come back tonight, give this to Toyo, Pops. You're not...? Don't worry. It's just in case. Then, I'll say be careful. I'm going to go have a drink for a change. Brother... Take care. Anyway, I'll be a full-fledged yakuza soon. And then we can get married. What? Aren't you happy? But I think it's wrong... - What you're doing. - Why are you saying this? What's wrong with yakuza? I thought you of all people would be glad for me. I'm sorry. No, don't mention it. Let's go. Wait for me. Welcome. You came. Open it. Satisfied? Come, sit down. What's all this? A toast to our past love. I missed you. Wait. I'll turn off the light. Kaori! Kuki, that was awesome. No wonder Kaori loved you. Damn you. You damn idiot. Welcome! Let him go. Pops! Damn. Let him go. Pops! Hey, Tetsu. Do it. Shoot if you can. Brother! - Pops! - They're both dead. Damn. How cruel! Brother? Brother? Brother Tatsu? Brother? Brother? Don't die. Toyo, Shun, Tatsu. Forgive my selfishness. My life was one betrayal after another. I'm going to try one last time. Maybe I won't come back. But I'm going. Here's the deed to Mops and a bit of money. Shinjuku Shin'eitai is yours. Keep it going in friendship. Kuki. Brother... Brother! Brother? What's wrong, Brother? Brother? Brother? Brother... Damn them. Todo, that dirty bastard. Toyo, what's going to happen now? Now that Brother Kuki is dead, too. Todo must be looking for us. They might come to kill us. Toyo, let's run for it, okay? No way! Why not? You'll just get killed if you stay here. Todo got Brother, Tatsu and even Pops. But there are two Shinjuku Shin'eitai left. Not me. I'll do it. Kill Todo. Toyo, it's no use. He'll kill you. He'll kill you if you go. Out of the way! I have to go. Toyo. Toyo! Yes? Oh, you're here. We can go. To Goto. The job's done. Really? I'm glad. - When can we leave? - Tonight. Tonight? But... Don't you want to? No, that's great. Then, we'll meet at the station at ten. - Ten? - Yeah. Keep this for me. Buy the tickets and wait for me. All right. Then, at the station. Promise? - I'll be waiting. - Sure. That's right, the first mistake was to take the Todo family on. - Right, Boss? - Absolutely. While we're alive, no one gets our territory. - Yeah. - Right? Die! Damn you. I'll kill you. Boss! Out of the way! Get out! - Move! - You bastard! Out of my way! Out of the way! Damn you, kid. Out of the way! Catch that bastard! Don't let him get away! - Hey, go that way. - Yes! Out of the way! Get out of the way! - You bastard! - You can't escape! Let me go! Let me go! Run away! That hurts... When you travel, The aroma of tea on the Suruga basin, Can't cure stupidity... It really hurts! Fools! I'm not going to die. Let me go. Stay put. Keep quiet! I really have to go. Release me. Yuriko... THE END
