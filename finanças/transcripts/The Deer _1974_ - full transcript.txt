Little sparrow, Ashi-Mashi Gavaznha - the deer You may not sit on our roof. Rain will fall and make you wet. Snow will fall and make a snowball out of you. You'll fall into painting pool. Who'll catch you ? The janitor. Who'll slaughter you? The butcher. Who'll cook you? The chef. And who'll eat you? The healer. Written and directed by Masoud Kimiai [at this point, a voice is added to the censored version: "Remember! It's the one and only time I assisted you in robbery.] ["Keep me out of robbery hereafter! I'll send your share."] Bader State School Hey buddy - Can you call Mr. Ali? - Which Mr. Ali? The janitor. Sure Yes sir? Were you looking for me? - Hello Mr. Ali. - Hello sir. What's the matter? I'm Ghodrat, Seyed's friend. Don't you remember? When my father used to not let me home in summers. and we were sleeping on the roof of second class with Seyed at nights! - Aha! How are you doing, son? I didn't recognize you Come in... Are you injured? You are bleeding! Is Aslani still the school principal? No, they've changed 3-4 times Come in Come in, you're badly injured, come in and eat something at least. Not really, it?s nothing, It's ok. It's an old wound. I'm looking for Seyed. Where is he? Haven't you seen him since school days? No, it?s been about 7-8 years. Is he still a trouble maker? Is he still being monitor of all? That was long time ago. Me and all of the old guys... We still adore him. - Where can I find him? - You should go to his workplace So he is working. Where is his workplace? You should go to upper Lalezar Avenue. Jameh-dar Theater. You can find him there Anyone will show you where it is, if you ask. Thank you Mr. Ali, I'll find him. Take care. If you see him, tell him to pay me a visit Where are you going Ma'am? Don't take other passengers, I will pay more. Sure, sir. That's what we want too. Are you okay? There's nothing wrong with me Stop here. Our programs will start shortly. Where can I find Seyed Rasoul, Ma'am? - Who is Seyed Rasoul? - The tall, in shape man I don't know, they say I can find him here He is called Seyed. We have just one Seyed over there, shouting behind the microphone. Our programs are just started, hurry up! A new all singing and dancing comedy: "Hitler's Anger" aka "The Rude Servant" Tonight and every night, hurry up! Hurry up, tonight and every night! Hurry up gentlemen, hurry up! Can I help you bro? Seyed! Yours truly, what? what can I do for you? Seyed! It's me, Ghodrat! Bader School! Don't you remember me? Ghodrat!? Yeah! That's it! You fucking bastard! How come after 10 years you came to visit me? Look at his glasses. You are welcome! Why are you bloody? Did someone hurt you? You are the same guy I knew. What's happened? Why are you in this shape? Do you have a room to shelter me for a few days? Why have you become like this? Ghodrat, why you yourself got into such a shape? Can I stay with you for a while? My ruined shack is yours. - What should I do now? - Take me there. Okay, let?s go then! What's up? Why theatre? I don't remember you being interested in theatre. Oh man, don't ask me any questions. I'm not in the mood... But you were the most principled of all us. I don't understand it. You really have a good memory. So, now you may tell. Why you? How far it is? - Did anyone notice our coming in? - Don't worry! Sit down here. Don't worry about anything. Just it would be better, if they nobody realizes I'm here. I'm concerned about you. Do you want me to call a doctor? Up the alley there's a drugstore too. No, don't bother. It can't last like this. You are still bleeding. You will lose your strength. Let me take a look Take this off. This is really a serious wound! It's really bad. It's not a knife wound. Tell me. Was it a bullet? I don't want to pry at all. But man, how has it happened? Are they after you? I'm not alone here. Yes, I see. Who is it? Her name is Fati. She used to love me. She has stood by me. She doesn't like me anymore. I mean she has half-heartedly stayed with me. She thinks it's being unfaithful to leave. She thinks that I am a superhero. She acts in the theatre She also sometimes sings, her artistic nickname is Naima. Take this. It?s clean. Until Fati comes, she'll know better than me how to handle the wound. So, Ghodrat.. She helps me with everything. Wear this and we should do something about this wound. Fati can do something she can make you feel better. After all, did you get your diploma? No, everything got so messed up. I couldn't. I left home. How is your mother? Does she still get angry at the sound of dice when you play the tables? You're my mate! You recall them so good! About 4-5 years ago... It was then that she died. May God bless her. Such an ache and you don't show it. By the way, what is the lumpish Asghar doing? - Have you seen him? - Wanna smoke? No. Asghar!? Which Asghar? The guy living in Saqqakhaneh, whose father made pickles! Man, how do you remember all these? I never forget him loving my little sister Maryam. You remember Maryam? Yes, I do remember well, well... She always used to braid her hair. He was in love with Maryam. And what we did to him! We beat him for about an hour! He couldn't sit down for a week. Maryam laughed for two whole days. Maryam... What's she doing now? She has five children now. I didn't think some day we're going to meet like this. Like what? Don't pretend you don't understand me. I have seen many things too. But didn't lose myself. I have been scarred many times. But again, I didn't lose myself. But Seyed, when I saw you... my heart tore apart. What drug are you on? Everything Everything! How long has it been? It's been about seven years. What can I say? Especially to you! You who shaped personality of at least a dozen person like me. Those times, you were much better than us. Clever students always being volunteer. Let me make some tea and then go to find Fati. Who drugged you for the first time? It started with a fight...a long story. I has no wick. In the middle of a fight, I scotched a bastard in the shoulder with my knife. They send me to jail for over a year. I had good behavior in prison. I've got pardoned 10 months into my conviction. I found a friend there. I asked him how much of his is left? He said he still has 5 years to go. I said "what was the charge?" He said he was in a fight. I said Reza - that was his name - "such heavy sentence for just a fight!?" He said "there was other things too." I said what other things? He said a small murder. I buy the best tea -- first rate. In short, I helped him to quit his drug habit without any help from a doctor. And it was then I sniffed it once or twice. There was a janitor. There was a janitor who pushed for us. Bringing into prison by hiding it in his ass hole. It was a business. When i got out of the prison there were that kind of people around me. My father was at school all time and having me around was so good for them. They took me to a couple of parties and I was an addict. I had no money! They told me to go to school and find new customers. A free dose for me for each new custormer. - Do you want to smoke? - No I don't. I was so lonely. It was so hard for a social person like me. No friend was around me. All of my friends had become officers or clerks. All clever students whom... I helped with their lessons. Accidentally, the officer of our cell used to be one of my classmates He never showed any sign of friendship. He was almost escaping from me. I used to fight for him with boys... from Haj Amir's neighborhood. We used to go to the gym together. After that, my mom died. I started to feel crushed. And then I've got beaten for the first time, in Lalezar. I had no excuse to be beaten. We both were alone. And the guy was so skinny. And I found that I deserve it. And I loosed myself. and tore apart like a worn cloth. We have so many things to talk about. We have lots of things to do. I?m going to go to find Fati. Drink your tea. I'll be back soon. Father! Father! You have believed in unseen God! Can you see that my God... ... your God... ... the God of Pharaoh... ... does everything on purpose? Well, Dear brother, Ramesses, how are you? You seem to be captive, why? I have always wanted to see my brother. But I regret to see that after a long time he has turned into a murderer. Why did you kill him? - He was my father, why did you kill him? - That's enough No need for your admonishment. Because I am a notorious one that ever since my birth... have hated all the people around me. Everyone ran away from me. Just because the sponging predictors of my father's palace had predicted that I would kill him one day. What were you expecting me to do, Ramesses? huh? To remain virtuous and chaste? No! Since I have known myself I wanted to seek revenge. Against everyone, even against my father And now, killing my father was the first step taken in this decision. And soon, your turn will come. Abbas, why on stage you were whispering that bullshit into my ear again? Twiddling me all the time, bastard! And you glorify yourself whenever you get the chance. Thinks she has won four Tonys. Piece of shit! How many times do I have to repeat it? What a bugger! If I slap your ear in front of the people... you won't do such shitty things anymore. Hey, if something was going to happen, it would already have happened. If it were a dog, it would already have left. If I report him to the manager, he'll get fired. - You started nagging again! - Watch your mouth. If you were a man, then I'd know how to respond to you. Don't mind her, that's not good at all. Do you call yourself a man? If all males were like you, then there wouldn't be any Man left in this world Aren't you my husband? Say something to this motherfucker, who won't let me go Motherfucker is the one who sleeps with you at nights You cuckold, don't hover around her. Don't be deceived by my appearance. I could hang you from your balls. Look, how brave he has become! I would kick his shitty ass and put him down. At 7:30 AM... A police officer receives a phone call... informing about a big robbery in 95 street, NY. Johnny asking Major George, his deputy to report. - Major George! - Yes Sir! Major George! Go to the Block 770 on 95 ST. Let me go! You really think you are the knight. You'll shoot immediately. Yes Sir. Sir!... Sir... It's flat. It won't go further. Let me fix it and then we'll move. Listen to me Abbas. Wait a minute. Listen to me, please! I beg you, man. Listen to me, just a moment. Let me slap on your face in front of Fati. She's changing her dress now. Let me behave like a man in front of her. Just once. Just once. I'll give you two weeks of my salary, bring you some drugs. Just let me slap your ears in front of her. Forget any shit I said. You know, I've heard you are a great man. Please, come here, just a moment. Come, please, for a minute I beg you. Son of a bitch! Did you clean your face? Let?s go. He won't dare to touch you again. How come you finally confronted him? I can behave like a man from time to time. First go to Niroye Havai, dude. - Where is it? - You keep driving, I'll tell you. We spend all of our salary on taxi. Why don't we go by bus? Are you going there, again? Yeah You don't have money, do you? Don't you have any more drugs? No, it?s finished. I have been in agony all evening. - What if he doesn't give you any? - I'll get it. I owe him 20 tomans. Ah, how tired I am... of this miserable doggy life. - ... of this life in vain. - Ah... You started again! Stay here, I'll be right back. - Hurry up. OK, I will. - Hello, Asghar. - You again. - I beg you Asghar. - Come in. I'm in pain. My arms and legs are in agony. How come, you only come here when you run out of drugs? Do you have money? I know I owe you money and I'll give it back. But right now I'm penniless. Didn't I tell you not to come here again? I told you that I don't sell in small quantities anymore. and you come directly come. Are you alone? There is no one, it?s just Fati. Just one more time, Asghar. I'll pay you back. At the beginning of next month. Who is that, Asghar? - Asghar! Who is that? - No one! Just a fool. The tea is over boiling. Once you went to Akbar's place, six cops were following you. And now it?s the same wickedness. I told you that I'm not ok at all. For the love of your wife and children. Just one more time, please. If I can't stand to make money, I won't be able to pay you back. I swear to God that I'll come back with money the next time. I'm not wicked like you. You fucking jerk, didn't you promise to bring me customers from school? You said your father is the school janitor and I can make friends with the students And you took all of them to other dealers. Whenever they turn you down, you show up here!? -Please -Fuck off right now I know you can hit me hard, but please don't Listen to me. Be patient please. You always come here begging me. Get out. Daddy! I swear on you, on your girl... They don't let me inside school. But I'll find you more. - Look at your beautiful girl. - Don't touch her with your filthy hands. - What's your name sweetie? - Parvaneh. Oh... What a beautiful name! Watch the girl! Go back! Asghar Agha! I have to spend a lot on the taxi. Please, somehow fix me up, I beg you. I don't have any. Get the hell out of here or I'll really beat you up. Asghar Agha, please I beg you... please... I don't feel well. For God's sake. I told you I can't, What a stubborn person... I swear on the holy book that I'm lifeless. Look, I can't even raise my hand. Asghar. Fati is waiting for me outside, If I leave empty-handed, cold turkey, she'll be disappointed. Don't beg that much, you son of a bitch Go away. Get your fucking body the hell out of here Listen to me, please, let me kiss your hands. - Don't make my hands filthy. - I beg you. Give me something, pills, opium, whatever... You bastard, you've turned me into this carcass. I'm not asking for too much. No one dared to say "No" to me. There was a time that I could beat bullies tougher than you. And now, look what's left me? God damn you... Barefaced, God damn me? Let him go, Asghar, don't kill him... You could beat me? Cuckold, fuck off now. Stop it, don't touch me... Don't you hit me anymore I said that I'm your slave, servant... And you just keep behaving like this... For the love of your family. I did whatever I could. Fix me up somehow, please. Fix me up... For God's sake. Fix me up... I've heard this moaning many times. Stop it or I'll hit you again. Don't hit me anymore, please. - I'm a dealer after all. - Mom gave this, daddy. She gave it for this man. May god grant you your wishes if you fix me up tonight. I won't come back empty-handed next time. My fault is I don't want to blacken young people's fate as you do? Asghar, behave like a true man. Don't you remember? I always backed you up, remember? Give it to me. What a nice girl you are, let me kiss you. Let the child go, I told you let her go. Let's go. Get out, get out. Get out of here, don't cause any more troubles. If you let me, I'll smoke it here in a while. I said out! What happened? What's happened to your face? Nothing, it's nothing. Listen Fati, I have a guest. He'll stay with us for a few days. - Who's that? - You don't know him, He's from the old days, from school - He's taken shelter in our house. - You want to give him drugs? Not at all. He's not such a person. I felt very embarrassed once I saw him. I never let anyone blackmail him ... nor did I let anyone dare to stare at his sister. I was always with him whenever he lost; and whenever he won, I left him alone. So, why do you tell me these things now? Nothing, just don't embarrass me in front of him. Fati, behave considerately for a few days, please. He still counts on me. We have nothing for dinner. - Well, we'll buy some stuff on the way. I fancied having drinks so much tonight. Shut the fuck up, stop bluffing for me. I know every detail of your shitty life. I know where the hell you come from and what you do. What indecency! Shame on you - Oh really? You wanna play with me?! We know how you play, you can't cheat us anymore, cunt! Everyone knows how your pimp husband is investing on you. Stop fucking about at this time of night, there are people living here. Who's that?! Let her go. - She doesn't let go of me and stop fucking me around. Fuck off bitch, everyone knows why your husband divorced you. You don't have a husband. If you had one, then I'd know how to have him hanged from his balls. Haha! Look at this cock-looking hen, do you yourself even have any balls? Mother fucker, you'd better go and prevent your bitch, who has an affair with every man in the neighborhood. I'm so tired of this house. It's going on all days and nights. And here's Agha Ghodrat. Give it to me. - Hello. How are you? - Hello. What's up? Seyed has told me so much about you Feel at home, like my brother How could you fall asleep with this noise!? He must have been so tired. They aren't to blame, Ma'am. If they were educated, they wouldn't do it. They have nothing to do. This is their nightly fun. Come and sit. Tonight I want us to drink and get drunk. Dear Fati, bring the bandages we just bought. See what you can do for the wound of this very loyal man. Yum, you're not taking I guess. That's bad! That's filthy! Let me clean my face. I'll be right there. It's been a long time that we haven't taken shots together. I took my first shots with you. Yeah, good old days. I don't like my role in this play at all. It's not artistic. The man before me plays foolishly. How can I play drama when that black guy keeps acting like a fool? Why don't you respond him? Booze price has risen. All intoxicants have got expensive. They're so hard to produce. Take this. If only I had a small refrigerator... Wow, it won't get better this way, you should see a doctor. - What caused this wound? - He's had an accident. Let me rub some ointment on it then. Here's the booze. You were talking about a refrigerator. Yeah, it would have been great if I could buy a small one. Well, it isn't hard to get one. You and your neighbors may raise money together and ... What are you talking about? Are you from another planet? Firstly, how can you provide ice for all these people living here? Then there will be a war about where to put the fridge. And on the first place, do they have anything to put in the fridge at all? The saying goes...the poor in the world is always upside down. You dig! How cool is this expression "upside down" It's kind of literary, isn't it? What a feat! Arak, yogurt and the rest! Don't be shy and join me. There is not much, but come on. At least it's good for your thirst. Thank you Ma'am. Let's have dinner. Go ahead. Thanks. I had some food in the theatre. I'm afraid if I turn on the radio and neighbors start nagging. Please sit here. I want to change my clothes. Turn your back to me please. Yes Ma'am. Here... open this bro. So good you're here. Thanks. When I weep... It gives me the hope that I'm still alive. To old days! You are always lively. Since the time I took my last shots with you... I have not taken any shot. It's about 7-8 years. I don't know. Tonight's feeling...You... To old days of you! When you left, I didn't understand who I am losing. Now you're here and I understand who's back. You are still quiet. You stare. You still have love in your eyes. And I'm sure you still don't lie. Like a pigeon on my shoulder. So good you?re here. I don't accept any excuses! I accept no one as a warrantor, either. I haven't opened a charity here. The ones whose rent is delayed, from one to however many days... They have one day to clear their debts unless I won't hesitate throwing their rubbish out. Oh God, take away my life. Yours, Mrs. Zeynab, has been exactly 3 months. I swear to God, to Imam Hussein that I'll pay all my debts by the end of this month. Kazem isn't here, he's gone to find a job. Kazem's gone! Then who is here when I am? Tomorrow, I won't believe either in God or in his servants. Begging won't work either. You rent your house then beg from these beggars. Calm down and sit in one place, kid. Mohammad Ali khan, come out. Then they say why is this yard dirty all the time. What's wrong? Why shouting again? Whenever you're inside, it takes you an hour to come out. Be quick before anyone else occupy it. Isn't there anyone to stop this guy? Sleep on your own roofs. I'm not bluffing, Tomorrow, even if you sacrifice your kids, all your stuff will be thrown out. He won't let it go, this time of the morning. Look how he's pawing the ground like a bull. You'll see! I'll make you all homeless. If Morteza's wife didn't flirt with him, He wouldn't even wait an hour. It?s just a pipe dream of yours to not to pay my money. Seyed! Get out of there. Don't hide yourself. Go! Get out and say everything you always say. I said get out! You can't fool me. Ok. I'm coming! This cuckold enjoys me begging him. Anytime his wife don't give him a go in bed, he comes here and takes it on us. Hey! I'm talking to you man! I told you I'm coming. Hello Asghar Agha. I'll pay you bro. I won't say tomorrow, but soon. Why are you dishonoring us early in the morning, body? Like the others, if you don't pay by tomorrow, I'll throw you out. Look Asghar Agha... Bastard! He looks like bitten by rabid dog! As if no one knows that he is banging Kamran's daughter and Morteza's wife. I'm going to visit my father at school. See you both later. Goodbye. I'm sure the dealer has asked him to go back to the school again. Please give him some advice. Do you love him? I used to. Now we are more like siblings. It's been hard for him to live. You know last night when he went to see his dealer... he came back bruised and shaken. It seemed he was beaten. At first, they even didn't ask him to pay for the drugs. They just wanted him to score new customers. So he started to deceive youngsters. He was like the wind and the kids were like leaves. Just like a wolf in the herd. - Is there something going on here? - Yes, a suitor is visiting one of neighbors. They say he is a shopkeeper. It seems he's OK. I wish them luck. The neighbors are helping with the ceremony. Poor girl. She deserves a better life than this. Even maybe her father would sell her. She's so pure, like a flower. Haven't you seen her? I remember a guy with a pellet gun. In the summer, he used to shoot at poor sparrows. Even though Seyed knew the boy's father was some hot shot in the government he smashed his gun into pieces. Sometimes I wonder whether he is the same man. There's still beautiful thing in the world. I tried to convince him not to bring misery to the life of the youths But now, they are harsh on him. They sell him low quality stuff and he's always languid. So he must buy more which means more money. And I can't afford anymore. If I'd any money earned in any way, I wouldn't have come here to you. Weren?t you supposed to not to come here? I need some money. I'm really hashed up. My salary doesn't even suffice my expenses. I hardly could manage my life. I have a guest. He is a friend of mine and I need money. I saw him. He seemed to be knifed. - Maybe he makes trouble for you! - Do you have some dough or not? The rent is overdue. I have no money to buy my medicine. I have debts to my theatre friends. I have guest. And Fati doesn't help me anymore. In brief: I'm fucked up! You always embarrass me. It's impossible to handle you. We can only wait until you die. What if you'd last longer in rehab? What can I do? I'm a servant of God too. What's the problem if a servant of god wants to be high? There are lots of people like me and I'm one of them. Most of people think they are tired at the end of the day. But in fact they are languid. Here. What's this? It's an old manuscript. It's expensive. Don't sell it for nothing. The calligraphy is by a master from Nishapur. I've inherited it. What can I do? I've sold everything I had for you. Now this one goes too. You may sell it and waste the money on heroin. I'll repay it, my good man. Oh, God help us! Come and see what's going on here! Are you going to keep all of these in this house, Asghar? The pay more rent than all of you together. But it'll make our children ill. Look what that bastard is doing! We should blame ourselves for not resisting against him. What else can you do? I'm not running hotel here! If you don't like it, get the hell out of here. It's not a barn to keep these sheep. It's our house. We live here! Seyed, You might say something. You live here too. What the hell is this? What are you doing Asghar? Asghar Agha! It's not a barn here. What are you doing? What are these? These are sheep... Sheep?s! - Oh! Really? - Any problem? Pay your rent! You're wasting your words. He understands nothing. None of you is a real man. If I was a man, I'd burry him right here. He's right. He wants his money. Don't interfere. You may not interfere. - Get in! - Shut up. Would you do the same if your family lived here? They'll bleat at nights. They'll disturb us. Today your sheep; maybe next one is your family. Settle the rest of them here. Dear Asghar, you shouldn't keep them here! If we say nothing to the bastard, next time he'll turn the place into a garage. Where are you going? You always said I'm free to go. Where do I have to go? The prophet said work at day, and rest at night. I work days and nights. Even weekends. I can't take it anymore. Look what do I get in turn. Just misery. The smell of cigarette and sweat. Bad mouthing. I always drudge with a hope that one day everything will be ok. But when? Ghodrat is not a stranger. One night I'm the Cleopatra and Juliet another night. One night I'm a housemaid and the wife of the pharaoh another night. And at the end of the day, they pay me just 150 Rials. And then I came back to this house between shits of sheep, Hens and kids. No love! No man! No work! No bonus! Not even a TV set. He even doesn't have enough power to kiss me! When the TV broadcast starts, you are in theatre doing your show. And I can't afford 250 tomans per month for a TV set. and just watch football, dear. - You just say nonsense. - And you just reply nonsense. The worst thing is to have you and TV together in this house. The hell! Nothing worse! And if you spend your time in the street to find love people will call you indecent. Women should have something to get attached! If I wasn't decent, all of my belongings was not just as much as bag! Man! Do something! I'm going to go to my sister's place. I'll wash clothes there too. Goodbye Ghodrat. Where did you get this book? I took it from my father to sell. ow much are you going to sell it? I don't know. The more the better! It doesn't matter to me. Seyed! Do you know what book is this? Take a look at yourself! Take a look around you! You were the best of us! You were worthy. Tell me who did this to you? Ask yourself, over and over again, if you want to take vengeance or not? You beg the person who brought misery to your life! You cry and ask him to make your life worse! Then where is your old knife? You help him to destroy the young people we'll be needing tomorrow. If my eyes are blind, my ears are not deaf. I'm on the level with you. Do you really want to know what is in this bag? Here! Take a look! Yes, all of them are stolen money! But this money may suffice the rent of all people in this complex for 2 years. It can buy that book of yours It can kill that man who made you like this and pay his blood. But this stealing is different from being a heroin addict! Stand up man! Make a move! I know what you want! Don't close your eyes to it. but it's better than being a thief! You weren't supposed the guy who takes money from his wife! Listen to me? How much do they pay you at the theatre? How much? It doesn't matter! I have no debt to no one so I don't ... I have to listen to your bullshits. I earn 7-8 tomans. So what? I'll pay you threefold. Now You may work for me! I want you nothing against religion. Nothing! no robbery, no tyranny! Nothing! Then what do you want? You just pick at me! Then what do you want? Nothing Seyed. Seyed Rasuol! Just make a man out of yourself again. I want nothing. Just stand on your feet. Do you remember when you throw your fist toward the wall... and the wall indented more than an inch? Now do it again! Do it and watch it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Ghodrat! Yes, I can! I can! I can! You told me to I should never be bullied. You were the one who helped me! You were the one who told me not to be afraid. You were the one who told me not to be afraid. Stop it! That's enough. Stop it. Stop! Yes, I can either. I can stand again! I can either! Ghodrat, my hands don't hurt. I have no pain. And I'll stand firm. You're still our leader. You've always been our leader. I love you, man. I love you, man. Oh my lord! Everyone is waiting for you to die! Pardon me for being straightforward. Everyone is permitted to utter his words if they have any. I'm listening. Oh great pharaoh! I need to tell you something privately. I do not trust anyone, even our minister. You may get closer. Come here and say it. Fuck off! Where is the manager? Shame on you man! I should call the manager. I told you a hundred times that stop harassing me. I'm tired of him! Move on! Stop this bullshit. Stop it you son of bitch! Leave her alone. It seems that you won't understand. I don?t let anyone hurts her anymore. Take it easy, man. Don't touch me. Let's get out of here. I drink this... to your... honour. What has he done then? Nothing. Today he made me proud of him at the theatre. He punished someone in the way that I got rid of him forever. To you! Cheers! I love you! - So what was the story? - Yes, I was just telling that ... Ezzat Big Mouth and Javad Garbage had some issues with Mammad. And Mammad wanted to bully them. Asghar, listen to me! Please have mercy on us. We are honorable people. Please. You're breaking them. You don't deserve mercy. Let go of me! I gave you ten days to move out. Next month, the rent will be doubled. I'd pay your rent if I had money. Just give me some time. I'm the tyrant! I'm anything you can't even think of! It goes this way if you don't pay my money! Got it? One by one! Next time is all of yours turn. Aren't you a cop? Please do something! Look what he is doing! Do something! I'm not on duty. But he wants his money and he's right. Man... My dear... Bastard! I gave you all money I had! I don't have anymore! I have no other way to handle my expenses. Don't you understand? I need this money! I owned a land that I sold to spend the money till the time I find a job. They promised to give me a job in two weeks. I've even sold my blood three times in the last three months. And this bastard thinks that we are his slaves. God may torment you! We have nothing left. People think the one who martyred Imam Hossein was a ghoul. It was people like him who killed Imam Hossein and made his family die of thirst. Who cut the hands of his children. Now the same people are kicking me out of my house. Oh People! Please help me! What should I do? You Muslims, help me! There is not even one man among you to sit him on his place? We haven't paid your rent. Why do you scream? You think there is no law in this country? Who the hell are you? Bitch! What's the use of shouting? We want here to be calm! If someone stop them, we can resolve this once and for all. You all say the same! You've got used to it! Your rent has been delayed for 3 months. Law is protecting me! You deserve no mercy! You don't get involved. Yes, she doesn't like you to be involved. If it's tough for you, go find a job and pay my money. You just sit here and talk about your problems. I wasn't born with silver spoon in the mouth. I've worked hard. Look! He's such a bastard! Someone should make him understood. Where are you going? They will kill you? Sit down! They will handle it themselves. - Wait! - let him go! It's the same old Seyed! Aren't you a Muslim? Don't you know he is jobless? You asshole, the country has law. Who the hell are you to throw out their stuff? Don't let this bastard do anything he wants! Reza is the next one; and then Mammad and Maliheh! Who the fuck are you! Don't ask him for mercy. Even the evil Shemr would show mercy in this situation. Thank you! Please help us! Who the hell you are to even show mercy! You junkie bastard! Beat him! Beat him! You cowards! You cowards! Help me! Some rich folks are distributing free meat! Let's go! How long should we beg you? Police! Call the police! Are you needing a cop? We have one among us here. God may torment you! I wish you the worst things. God! Why me? Why me? Why me?! My girl! My little girl! You came to the city for nothing. I swear I said and he accepted. I want you to be comfortable. Listen to me. Living in the big city has lots of problems. There are bastards who want to destroy your life. When you understand it, it's too late. And you'll have no way out. Wait here for me to get out. Oh officer! please tell him to not cut it so short! It's taken so many years to get so long. Officer! - Is this the one breeding doves? - Yes Sir. Officer please. Forgive me. I'm sure you are so gentle to forgive me. I swear my birds will never fly in the sky again. Otherwise you even have the right to cut my head off. It's an order. We must cut their head off. Oh officer! They're just like children to me. Especially the one with brownish tail. It's a sin to kill them. Officer! Officer! Please. You may help me! I swear to god I'll even sleep on the roof all summer and winter... to prevent them fly around. I swear I'll keep them in the cage. This was the last time. I'll watch them. Please help me. - I can't. - Please. They're just animals. God damn it! We'll see. It's just the beginning. They'll do something to you that you shit your pants every time you hear my name. You shameless man! Bullshit! Thanks! They all flew off. I love you all. Who set them free? Isn't there anyone to watch them? Where's officer Mohammadi? I swear I didn't do that. It was that child. I'll kill all of them. - Hello, officer. - Hello. He persuaded them to beat me. Officer, I swear he is lying. Come here please. Officer! He is such a bastard. He is bothering everyone. Please take a look me! Do you think... such an addicted person like me can rise against such a giant like him. Ask for his forgiveness or unless you must stay here. I'm thankful to you officer. Thank you. I promise I'll cripple your other foot. - We'll see. - Ok, We'll see. Yes bro... Yes. Look Asghar Agha! If you drop the charges, all will be fine. But if you don't, we may see each other again someday. Don't we? Then you have to face me and my blade knife. And I'll tell everyone about your thing with Garbanzan's daughter. Now it's your call! Yes bro! Make your decision. Officer! I want to drop the charges. - Why are cops here? - What's up? Which one is Mohammad's room? I mean Mohammad and Ali's room. Go upstairs. It's right in the front. - Why are you interfering? - Can I ignore the police? Mohammad Akbari! He's not home. What has he done? We must see him. - Get away! - We're men of law! What the hell this wretched has done? Let him go... Where're you taking him. Let him go. - Let me go. - Let's go. Seyed! Fati! Seyed! I saw everything over the window. It's OK. I saw them taking your friend. Have a sit. I saw you getting out of the room. Sit. Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid. Maybe they come back. Maybe they come back and seek everywhere.. I should get out of here anyway. They won't be back. Tell me! Did you do robbery? Are you a smuggler? What crime you've committed? Haven't seen you around. Are you a friend of Seyed? Yes, I'm a friend of Seyed. I'm a criminal. I'm wounded and I sneaked in as well. Poor Seyed is innocent. I'm not good at all. I've been sick for last 3 days. I have shiver and fever. I cannot leave here. I wish they won't come back here. And they won't. Your friend did the right thing allowing you to escape. Don't be afraid. I'm here. I trust you. But I don't know why! What's your name? You may talk to me. I'll hear you. I'll answer you. Then you don't need my name. Let it get darker and I'll help you to leave here. Did any of neighbors see you coming here? They saw me running away... But they don't know I'm here. I don't feel ok. Take a nap. If you're not comfortable, you may leave now. But I advise you not to do so. Wait for some time. Count on me. I'll protect you as long as I can. You're neither in a good situation. And I neither let them take you. I don't know what you did. But I'm sure all of it ... is out of misery and ineluctability. Do you have a cigarette? I'm not a smoking guy. And Seyed takes his cigarette with him. It's better you take a nap. Go to bed. Stay brother. Let's don't fool ourselves. They'll come for me sooner or later. If they come here for me once more... it'll bring you into the trouble. It's not a good idea. You'll lose your life for nothing. I'll take my ass out of here tonight. Even If I?m dead. And you'd better not to stay. Listen Sir! Take something from me as a memento. Neither do I know you nor do you. But anyway, there is something wrong with both of us. Anywhere you hide... Don't stay more than a couple of days... Even at your brother's home. Sleep. I'll guard from the window. Aren't you hungry? Give me some water. I'm burning. - Hello to Ghodrat, my own man. - Hello. You are late. Oh... It seems you've got so moody these days. I'm so tired. How're you? We have a guest. It's your neighbor. Huh? - What's he doing here? - Take these. What's he doing here? He seems very comfortable! It's Mohammad! He looks awful. How long has he been here? Is there a problem? Is there something wrong with their room? Some cops crushed into the house. They tried to search their room. They took his friend and he sneaked out. Neighbors pretended to not seeing him. He entered the room suddenly. He's sick. He has shiver and fever. - He may cause us problem. - It is all up with me. - Didn't he tell you what he's done? - No, and It's better for you to not know too. We shall keep him calm. I couldn't do that alone. Wake him up now. Hey ... Hey ... Wake up! ... Hey. Don't be afraid, buddy. It's nothing. Hello Seyed. Hello Madam. I put you in trouble. Sorry. Don't alarm him. What's wrong Mohammad? It's nothing. Keep calm and tell what's wrong, bro. - He looks messed up. - We are almost getting used to these things. Do you want me to take you to the hospital? Spill it! What can we do? Fati and Seyed... He was here when I entered. He's with us. Say it. Nothing. Cops crashed into the house. Ali hold them back. You know Ali. right? Ali made some uproar to let me escape. What will happen to him? but they won't find me. They won't find me. Don't be so afraid. It's safe here. What do you want to do? Nothing. Just I want to go. But not through the street. No one in the neighborhood should know. There are nosy people everywhere. Do you want something to eat? Oh... he's not ok at all. Maybe a doctor or medicine or something... No... No... No... Thank you all. just help me to get to the roof. I'll go to Reza Shiri's home. He has a motorized tricycle. He should be home now. Yea... he'll help me. Do you have anywhere safe to go? You know they've eyes everywhere. You must be careful. Yes, I'll be. Just I need to get some medicine someway. It's not your job to do. I know. Getting here so crowded is not good. Let me give him some ood. You've got so weak, Mohammad. You need some energy to walk. You know the way to the roof. But he should get back to life first. You stay here. I'll take him. Just watch me to get to the roof of Haji's house. I'll do the rest. Ok. Let's go. I'll take you to the roof but you must be so careful after that. I'll be right back. Goodbye Mohammad. We may see each other one day. Hope so. Let's go Mohammad Agha. I'll be right back. It won't take so long. Have you seen your picture on the newspaper? Tell me! Did they write everything? I saw this newspaper a couple of days ago. I've thought too much about what is inside that bag. Does Seyed know? He didn't say a word to me about it. I knew that you know. But Mrs. Fati... If it'd be necessary for you to know what is in that bag... I'd have tell Seyed before which I did so. I trust Seyed like a saint. Even now that he is so messed up. Look at him. He's so brave yet. [All the armed robbers except the man in the picture have been arrested] He's gone safely. But he was so sick. He was such a good boy. So calm and shy. They said that he's studying with Ali at nights. It's said that they?d beaten Ali very badly. Have you seen my picture on the newspaper? Your picture? So the cat is out of bag finally. Let me see. All the armed robbers except the man in the picture... So she knows everything. Now I want you to tell me why robbery? You who blame me for being addicted; who called me a capon. You destroyed my world. You called me slipshod. I never called you slipshod. I just reminded you of yourself. And that's why now you are asking me about the money and the wound. Look my friend, I stayed and you left. I didn't get educated but you did. I was alone like an island and you saved yourself. And at the end... You're that and I'm this. Did you do the right thing? if a saint man does robbery, It's the same for him. If i say this, you'll accuse me for being illiterate. if I don't understand, It's not my fault. No one tried to make me understand. You're my mate and I love you. I even sacrifice myself for you. But stop blaming me. You did no better than me. You lived your life and I lived mine. And at the end of the story we are both nothing but shit! Listen to me my monitor. It's too late for me. There's a big difference between robbery and drugging school students. You should stop that drug dealer, even if there's one bigger above him. You are supposed to hit people back if they hit you. For what? I cannot destroy them all. There're too many of them. Does it really work if I stop him? It will stop all addicts in that case? Stopping the dealer means less future junkies. But the money I've robbed... It can buy cloth for all people in this complex. It can buy this house and make it their own. But... Do you have something that... can make this woman happy just for a day? There was no one to stop me. If I could do something to make Fati happy,... I'll do it happily. I wasn't an addict at first step; I was pushed into being one. I'm the illiterate one. I don't get it when someone stabs me in the back. You think robbery is right? No bro. It's illegal. Illegal is Illegal and I don?t understand it when you say it?s right. Ghodrat! If I became flimsy, I didn't deserve it. If it wasn't for the love of Fati... I've killed myself long time ago. What do you think? You think that I enjoy this life? Do you think that I lost my mind? No! I swear I know everything. I'm paining but my pain is not like yours. My life is full of begging and I hate begging for drug. Mate, I know what you mean. I'm ... ...going out. I'll be back in an hour. Who's there? Hello Mr. Asghar. Hey. Come in. Thanks. What the hell you want? Did you find new customers? Hold on a second Asghar Agha. I have words. I've found some new guys. Do you do the delivery? By the way how many customers I've found till now? You're talking too much tonight. Yes, because I'm also talking on their behalf. That's it. Help! Help! Help! Yes? Oh my God? What's wrong Asghar? Asghar who did this to you? Who injured you? Tell me. Tell me Asghar! Who did this to you? I've buried a bowl there. Clean the house ...to not to make ... you and the kid ...trouble. Hurry up! - To you! - Cheers! Ghodrat! If you're not comfortable here, I'll ask my father to shelter you. He lives at school. No one will get suspicious. No Seyed. I should get away from here. It's so messed up. My picture is on the newspapers. Then... Anything you say. You order and I'll do. Is Fati asleep? Yes. Why? Is she trustable? You can. Especially now. You know me. When I say something I really mean it. I don't know why do I do this? Yes I understand. For you to be comfortable... Here... It's about a couple of hours ... since I've killed Asghar the heroin dealer. Is he dead? That man had been killed more than a hundred people like me. You were right. So right. Oh, holy saints. It was so cool! I want you to take this bag to an address. He is so trustable. I'll take your bag anywhere you say. I'll go with Fati. I may catch people's attention. But being Fati with me ... will distract people. Ok, let me give you the address. All streets are blocked. Stop resisting. If you take a look around... you'll see you have no way to escape. The thief doesn't keep the stolen money with him. [sounds like the dialogue's added by the censorship] If you return the stolen money, you'll get a lighter sentence. We must catch him alive. We've been informed that he's been hidden here for some days. He will take no long if he is wounded. Just make it quick. Surrender yourself and stay alive. If you take too long, You'll die for nothing. If you want to surrender, just break one of windows. and we won't shoot you. Be careful. He shouldn't lose his hope. Get away! Hey... Get away from here. Fati, don't stay here. Go to your sister's. I won't let you alone, Seyed. I'm worried about you. I'll go only if you go. When I say go I really mean it. Go and let me do my work. Why should I go? Step out of this. It makes so much trouble. I said go and you should go. I said I'll stay with you and I will. I said go to your sister's place then you should go. - Hello. - Hi. Here is our house. I know you want to capture him. I'll go in and take him out if you let me. He is a thief. He should surrender or he'll die. No officer, I'm his friend. I'll change his mind. OK, wait a moment. There is a junkie here who says he can make him surrender. It is his friend. The one sheltering him. Hold on a second. It's his friend. He says he knows how to make him surrender. He can take him out. We should arrest him (Seyed) anyway. We let him in and maybe he can convince him. Not a bad Idea. Give the order. Two officers take him next to the wall. - Search him. - Yes sir. Take him to the house. - Thank you officer. - Watch him. Hey you! Listen carefully. What if you play a trick on us? Officer, my friend will listen to me. I'll talk to him from the yard. I swear I want him alive more than you want. You may go but stay in the yard. No farther than the garden. Thank you. You know... He's my friend. He will listen to me. Just tell them not to shoot me. Make sure about that please. Nobody shoots. It's his friend entering the yard. Ghodrat! Why are you here Seyed? Calm down. Everything is ok. Why don't you get out? They'll take you to the jail. At least you stay alive. Seyed! Stay out of this. I've made so much trouble for you. Stay out of this. Get out! You've underestimated me. My body has deteriorated, but not my loyalty to you. Either you'll get out or I'll get in. Seyed stop this madness. Get out! Don't lose your sense. Freeze! Don't be afraid. It's not deep. Just the same as yours. Stay there. Don't move. Not even an inch. Why did you do that? It's none of your concern. How bad is it? I lived long enough to see myself shot. Seyed! Get out of here. It seems you didn't get it. It's my home. I always wanted to die in a good way. And this is the good way. I'm in. It's better to die by a bullet than dying in the gutter. I won't lose my mate for nothing. You are always my man. Little sparrow, Ashi-Mashi You may not sit on our roof. Rain will fall and make you wet. Snow will fall and make a snowball out of you. You'll fall into painting pool. Who'll catch you? The janitor. Who'll slaughter you? The butcher. Who'll cook you? The chef. And who'll eat you? The healer. Subtitles: Esoterisch, Rookielady, corvusalbus END
