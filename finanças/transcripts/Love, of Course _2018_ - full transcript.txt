- Hey! - Hey. I think I'm gonna leave Mr. Hugsy here. - Really? - I'm eighteen. But he's so cute, and you've had him for so long. Mom, it's not really cool to show up to college with a stuffed animal. I did, Penelope Josephine got me through a lot of late-night studying. So, are you hungry, can I make you something for the road? We should grab some food on the drive. Okay, gas station hot dogs, are not an option. I'm serious Mom, I'm not hungry. But thank you! - Hello? - Hey Marcus, in here. - You're baking? - Yeah, for the road. - I tried to reason with her. - Well I am who I am. For the new freshman. Thank you Uncle Marcus. Well, spoiler alert... It's a gift card for the off-chance your mother forgot something. Never. - Maddy! - Maddy? New roommate. Hey! We're almost on the road. Make sure I have Maddy's phone number, her parents home and cell numbers, and everyone's emails. Did you get everything on that list? My gosh. You... are the best. True. And your freshly watered plants will say the same, when you get back from Oregon. This was out front. Those real estate agents have been circling this house forever. What is that look for? Just, you know, maybe now is a good time to consider. I'm not going to sell this house. Joe and I bought it together. Cara... took her first steps right over there. - All my memories are here. - Why not make new memories? - It's been six years. - I know, it's just... I don't know... what to do next. It's just been me and Cara for so long, and now it's... me. Well, why not go back to work? Well, I haven't been an accountant for anyone outside this family since Cara was born? I mean, what would I put on my resume? Girl Scout leader, chaperone to all the school dances, the head of the PTA for the last 18 years! That would be outstanding head of the PTA for the past 18 years. No, but seriously Marcus, I mean, who's gonna hire me? Hey... Someone smart, someone who wants someone smart. Detail oriented, always gets things done. Look sis, whatever step you do take, make sure it's the best one for you. Yeah. And don't stop baking. - Hey those are for the road. - Excellent idea, I'll take two. Hey! - You ready? - Yeah. Let's go. Alright, I'm spending the night at Cheryl and Burt's before heading out tomorrow, so I'll still be here if you need me. Cool, it'll be nice to see Mr. and Mrs. Morgan again. Don't forget, Cheryl is not just my friend, she's the director of admissions, - ... and Burt's... - Burt's an econ' professor. Yes Mom. I know. Look, I'm just saying you have people there, - so you won't be alone. - I'm not going to be alone. I'll have Maddy, and all of my new friends. And it's not like you and I won't be talkin' everyday anyway, but thank you. What is it? I'm hungry. I love your pumpkin zucchini muffins. I know. Yes! - So exciting. - I know. Are these dorms? These, I think... are these your dorms? I think my class is actually. What is that? We should get that lamp. Mom watch out. You can go forward now. So I downloaded your meal plan to your calendar. And, you're signed up for all the school alerts. Mom, seriously? Well, I mean dorm rooms are like preschool all over again. Trust me. I'm going to be like 30 by the time the thing's empty! Wait... just... Let me help you out here. - Mr...? - Hugsy. Hugsy. - Yours? - My daughters. From a long time ago, and he isn't supposed to be here. Well I thought you might change your mind. - Thank you. - Yeah. I think it's time I moved on from Mr. Hugsy. Thank you. I've seen this scenario play out a lot. Teddy bear rejection? Parents that have a tough time hitting the release button. Why would you say that? Just a feeling. Really, I'm sorry, and who are you? - I'm Noah. - Noah... - Well Noah, are you a parent? - No, I'm not. Then how could you possibly know how difficult a day like today is? Yes and no, I've worked here for 3 years, and this is the fifth school that I've worked at. So I've seen it a few times. - How many schools? - Five. It sounds like moving on is your specialty. Touche. - Did she go... - Yeah straight through there. And for the record... I can hit the release button just fine. When it's time. - Hi! - Hi! New roomie! Roomies oh my gosh. We're gonna have so much fun together. Maddy this is my mother. - Nice to meet you Maddy. - You too. - Maddy Seaton. - Hi. Okay Girls, so, I got, matching bedding if you want okay, there's no pressure. This way you'll have the best room in the hallway. Mom, she has her own. - But this is cool, we can match. - Okay, yeah. So Maddy, are you from around here? Yes Ma'mm. Portland. And you chose to go to school at Oregon College because you wanted to be close to home? Actually I picked it because my grandfather's an allum' and he wanted my dad to go, but Dad ended up settling up abroad. So now it's up to me to carry the torch. And I couldn't be prouder of you. Granddad, this is my new roommate Cara, and her mom, Mrs. Andolini. - Hi, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too. I just stopped by to tell my granddaughter that I am heading home now. - Well walk me to the car. - Sure. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Do you wanna come with? We can explore the campus. Yeah, sure! You don't have to come with us if you don't want to. What do you mean? Like if you want to meet the Morgans earlier or something. - But your room's a disaster. - No I'll organize it later, I promise. I learned from the best. Well, I'll say goodbye before I leave tomorrow. - I love you! - I love you! - Okay. - Okay. I guess it's just you and me Mr. Hugsy. You driving, or is Mr. Hugsy? I mean I'm just asking so I know how much of a head start I'm gonna need. Well you better start now. And... lift. - I got an idea. - Yeah, what's that? Yeah, you should come for dinner tonight my friend. Cheryl's from from her sorority days is in town from L.A.. Raincheque. I'm washing my hair tonight. You just said that didn't you. That reference is about 50 years out of date, but I'm gonna let it slide because I'm a good guy. Well thank you for your benevolence. Look Grandma, wash your hair another night alright. Amy's fantastic, she's single, she just dropped off her daughter at school. Well then definitely not. I deal with parents way too much as it is. Buddy you gotta date, you have to date. I do date. Yeah you do, but you don't date anyone you could actually fall in love with. - Not yet. - Not yet, yeah. For a guy who loves to plant so much, you sure don't like to put down roots. I dunno, that my friend is why you are a tumbleweed... Tumbleweed, I know. There we go. Alright Tumbleweed, let's row. The way she bolted out of the house, you'd think she was on a track scholarship and not science. You were the same way in college. - I was not! - Yes you were! Remember I was the one you were going off with. Okay, fine, but I spent plenty of time with my parents. It'll never be enough. I mean Connor is five, and I'm dreading the day he goes off to college. You're the director of administration, like he's going anywhere else. And just to make sure, I've completely decorated his room in navy and orange. Well, I tried pushing L.A. area schools on Cara, but one of my best friends decided to woo her North. Well, sorry. We're lucky to have her. Anyway, I could woo her mother too. I have my degree. Not as a student, to help me with events. You were always so good at it back in college. Don't you already have someone? We do, and she's due in two weeks. Exactly. I had temp lined up, but he decides to take a permanent position at tech. - So it's all on you. - These shoulders, right here. I mean Burt's been a dear, but it's like my life... Slow down! Hold on. Now that Jeff's got everything in place, Success hangs on whether or not he can get the generator started. There I go. One species, the Siberian Chipmunk... The tumbleweed dispersal strategies are unusual among... Seriously? Most species disperse their seeds, by other mechanisms. My darling, dinner was... Fantastico! Hey, what's with the phone at the table. I'm sorry hun, but somebody's gotta take point on this Harvest Fest, and since I can't get lady here to bite, it's all me. What is the deal with this Harvest Fest anyway. Well that is my cue to get you into the bathtub Young Man. - No! - Yes! You're going! Say goodnight. Say goodnight. Goodnight. Careful. Goodnight sweetie. Well the Harvest Festival is your basic small-town festival. And it's supposed to be a fundraiser - for the agriculture department. - Is it? No, it's been in the red for the last few years. So the new school president, issued an ultimatum... If it doesn't make money this year, it's not coming back next year. - And why is it failing? - It's boring. - No, That's the worst. - Stop it. Our special events director likes to focus a little bit more on sports, so she seated most of the responsibility for the Harvest Festival to professor Farris, he runs our environmental sciences. He's an amazing teacher, he's excellent with his students, but let's just say he puts a little more emphasis on the harvest, and not the festival. So it's basically a farmers market. Yes! You know I was only mostly joking earlier, it's not such a crazy idea. - Cheryl... - For real, just listen to me okay? I remember how good you were at organizing our parties back in college. You made things fun and profitable, and you've run all the events in Cara's school since kindergarten. You my friend are a natural, and I need a natural. - I can't just leave Los Angeles. - Why not? Cara's here. Why, did you have a job lined up, are you going back to accounting? No, actually, I don't know what I'm gonna do next. I've just... I've been a mom for so long. Well this is perfect then. Okay. The Harvest Festival is six weeks away, you take this time to figure out your next step. - Six weeks? - That's all I need, okay. And then I can find someone to take over for Josey's maternity leave. Yeah, but I don't even live in Oregon. I deal in temporary housing all the time, I know the perfect place. And what about her independence? I will keep you too busy, she will have it. I forgot what a good negotiator you are. - Six weeks? - Six weeks! Is that a yes? It's a strong maybe, but I have to make sure it's okay with Cara. Understood. And I wanna meet this Professor Ferris. Done, he's usually on the campus farm. Excuse me? Excuse me. Have you seen Professor Farris. At your service. If you're looking for Mr. Hugsy, he's not here. - You're a professor? - I am. You look like a farmer. - And what brings you by? - Did Sheryl Morgan talk to you? I'm assuming it's not help me plant the broccoli, which I gotta get goin' on before the events planner get... - You. - Me. I thought you were a mom. Moms can do two things at once. It's actually our superpower. And you're Sheryl's friend. How 'bout that. And you're here to talk to me about the Harvest Festival. And see if we can work together. Well, I'm just gonna do the same thing I've been doing the last three years so... - Well, that might be a problem. - How so? Well are you aware that the Harvest Festival needs to make money this year? How far off are we? That's a lot worse than I thought. - You didn't know? - No, no. I mean the budget details, that was never my department. My job, was to make sure the campus farm was highlighted in the community, and in doing so, the farming community would be highlighted at the festival. Right, and my job if I take it is to make sure I get the people there, and increase the revenue. And though I'm sure that the tomato crops are riveting... We need to up our game in terms fun and activities. Emphasis on festival. - It's too cold for tomatoes. - You know what I mean. - Look, Mrs Andolini... - Amy. Local farmers need exposure, they don't need pumpkin games. Yeah, but pumpkin games sell tickets. That's giving exposure to the farmers. Yeah, but there's only so many spots. So for every pizazzy element that you put in, a farm gets left out. Yeah but imagine how left out they're gonna feel next year if there is no festival. And the campus farms don't get the attention they need for future funding. Okay, that's a fair point. Thank you. But it's not the only point. I mean if this whole event turns into a bunch of frivolous activities that are, vaguely associated to anything Harvest related, then my department doesn't even need to be involved to begin with. You know, that's a totally fair point, and I'll keep it in mind if I decide to take the job. And when are you deciding. After I talk to my daughter. Hey sweetheart. Hey Mom. Hey. Have you left yet? No. Good. Thought you were gonna leave town before I got a chance to say goodbye. Well, that's never gonna happen. Hey can I... Can I ask you a favor? Sure. Whenever you go back to L.A. do you mind sending me some jackets? - Jackets? - Yeah, like a lot of them. It's already in the 60's here. This weather's been a total... Surprise. - Your mom's been busy. - Oh my gosh. Well, just while I was waiting for you. - Is that lemon grass? - You mom bought us a diffuser. Well just a... with a little selection of essential oils so you girls can relax after a hard day of studying. Mom, thank you! Wait, it's getting kinda late, you're not thinking of driving home right now are you? Well, that's an interesting story I wanna run by you. So you would be here... - at my school... - For six weeks. I am fully aware that you did not plan to bring your mother to college with you. No... Look don't get me wrong, like, I love hanging out with you, I really do. - It's just... - You're eighteen. And you need your independence. Yes! You know your grandmother used to joke that she was going to come to college with me... And, she was joking, I think... But I knew how important it was for me to be on my own, and I would never want to do anything to get in the way of that for you. - So I can explain to Cheryl... - No wait. Do you want to take the job? - I do. - Well then you should take it. Really? I'm... - It is just six weeks though right? - Yes, 'til Harvest Fest is over. Yeah. I promise. Okay. I like what you've done with the place. Well, well, well. I almost didn't recognize you in a sportcoat. With elbow patches and everything. That makes me the cool professor. So I guess your daughter gave you permission to stay. Well, we have an understanding. I'm gonna stay until Harvest Fest is over, and then I'm gonna go back to Los Angeles. And do what? I mean, are you an event planner, or are you a baker? I'm well... I was. Well, I guess I still am, an accountant. I do a lot of school events. I mean, not professionally. - Okay. - But I can do this one. Alright. So, the first thing to do when holding an event like this is to determine your resources. So I read through the last three years of the Harvest Festival files, and we have our work cut out for us. How so? Well, one of the reasons that the Harvest Fest has been so barebones is that the same sponsors have always given the same amount. - At least we're consistent. - Yes, but we need more. We need more vendors, we need more sponsors, or the people that are giving, need to give more. Because we need the resources to expand the fun activities that attract the attendees, Like... Like pumpkin games. We do not need pumpkin games. What do you have against pumpkin games? - They are wasteful. - They're fun. Someone takes the time to plant the seed, in fertile soil, they water it, they wait like 3-4 months for something to grow, only to have someone else throw the fruits of their labor against the wall, or across the field, or whatever. No. I see. See what? You've never actually played Harvest Festival games, have you? Of course not, they're ridiculous. Professor Noah Ferris, I have a question for you. What are you doing this Saturday afternoon? - Pumpkin. Bowling. - It's fun! Look, there's not exactly a dearth of these things, so you can sorta dial down the pumpkin guilt. Okay. I'm sorry about this. Well, I think that's a gutterball. Yeah. Well, I mean, it's not easy. So. Alright! - Yes! - Yeah! Good job Elliot. Yeah. Wait, did I just get out-bowled by a toddler. - Yes, I think you did. - Thanks. - You wanna... - Yeah, no please. What? - Nice form. - Thanks. - Really? - Yeah. Okay. I see how it is. I got this, I got this. Trying a little different technique here. Okay. C'mon. Yeah. Hold it where the stem is. Okay, thank you. I appreciate that, bud. Pretty sure that kid's got a future in professional bowling. I told you it was fun, you just have to get the hang of it. I gotta be honest, I... had a really good time. But see, this is the draw I'm talking about for the festival. You make it so fun that people don't even feel like they're at a fundraiser. It's a good trick. Oh my gosh, I worked on millions of carnivals, and festivals, and fundraisers while Cara was growing up. Especially after my husband passed. - I'm sorry. - Thank you. I just threw myself into doing as much as possible. Probably a lot more than Cara liked. I don't know, I'm sure she appreciated having you there. So, what about you Professor Ferris? Where did you grow up. - Believe it or not, Brooklyn. - Brooklyn!? But you don't have an accent. When you go to Stanford, you lose your accent pretty quickly. And how did you end up at Stanford? - Bowling scholarship. - Bowling. Rowing scholarship. I was gonna major in finance, and then in my freshmen year, a buddy of mine took me for a hike in Yosemite and I just... I mean I just fell in love with nature right then and there. And yeah... No more concrete jungle for me. It's like it freed me up entirely and just started traveling like crazy, and exploring all the things that I missed out on growing up. And why'd you stop traveling? Well, if you ask Burt and Cheryl, I haven't. They kinda call me Tumbleweed. Because I tend to change schools every few years. So I take it you're not in the tenure track. No. Not so much. Although watching Burt stay put and seeing what he's got with Cheryl and Connor and their life together... It's really nice. Yeah, so that means it's about time for you to go a new school? You know what, I got a meeting I gotta get to, so I'm sorry. You know what, I know it's not your specialty, but do you mind going over the sponsor list with me, it might help me with. You know, before I do any formal outreach. Yeah, I have Wednesday afternoon available. That's great, that's great. - Okay. - Okay. Good. - Alright. - See you soon. Yeah, I'll see you then in... Amy, Harvest Festival. Pumpkin bowling rematch. It's on. Well, you better practice Professor. Amy! - Hey. - Hey! What are you doing here? I thought we were meeting tomorrow to go over everything. We are, I'm just trying to figure out where the best place to put the stage is. - What stage? - For the band. What band? I have been like scoping the area for options, of which there are disappointingly few. And I've narrowed it down to Molly Sheep and Mercury In Retrograde, they're both cover bands mostly. Leaning towards Mercury In Retrograde, thought I'm a little worried that their name may portend disaster. What, I'm sorry... Why do we need a band? Music... you... you know there's gonna be music, right? Yeah, I just thought we would be playing it over the stereo like we usually do. Yeah, but not if you're having dancing. Wait, you wanna have dancing in my barn? One, I'm pretty sure it belongs to the school, unless there's something you're not telling me. And two, it's the best space available. What, there is no space available. Take a look around it's full of equipment. We can move all the equipment. No, I mean, I got a cedar spreader over there, I've got a tractor with a loader and a landscape rake, and some corn, a water tank. I've got lots of stuff. I mean do you even know what a plot forge harvester is? Is it bigger than a breadbox? Yeah, it's a little bigger than a breadbox. - So where are we gonna put all this? - Well, baseball season's over, so maybe we can park some of the bigger stuff out on the field for a few days, and the rest of it we can just put up there. Good luck getting Coach Stuart to agree to that. Oh he will... watch. Do you really need all of this stuff. You really don't know anything about farming do you? Well if you mean like, driving by on the freeway. - No, that's not what I mean. - No, then no. So how are you gonna throw a Harvest Festival when you actually don't know anything about harvesting? Well I've never been to the North Pole, and I've thrown some pretty legendary Christmas parties. Thank you very much. Well, before you get too confident, I think a little turnaround would be fair play here. What do you mean? Well you wanted to show me all the finer points of the festival part of what we're doing... Yes. Yeah, well I think it's only fair that I show you the harvest part of the equation. I thought you were gonna take me to see farming. This all part of farming. This is the middle-part, and here's the star of the farmers market right here. - Hi! - Sammy's here every week aren't you. - How you doin'? - So cute. Yeah, most of the vendors at the farmers market, they follow the 80-20 rule, which means, 80 percent of what they sell, is grown locally, and 20 percent is brought in from elsewhere. And... I mean there's not gonna be a quiz or anything. No, I'm just taking names for possible sponsors you know. Well, I think maybe some of these guys might be a little too small for sponsors. Mom? - What are you... - Hey! Hey guys. Hey Mrs. Andolini, Professor Ferris. Hey Girls, what are you both doing here? My Grandfather has an orchard, and I help out sometimes. And I'm just helping Maddy out today. Don't worry, I promise both you guys I'm caught up with all my courses. Yeah, that's a good thing 'cause one of your professors just might have a pop quiz coming up. - Good. - Just so you know. - Your Grandfather is... - Edward Seaton. - One of our sponsors. - OK, I knew, I knew the name. I was actually gonna reach out to him about upping his sponsorship. Well is he at the orchard today by any chance? Every Saturday. - Okay perfect. - This is great. Now, you get to see some farming. - Yay. - Good to see you guys. - Bye. - Goodbye. Planting. It's the more important step in the whole process. You have to make sure that you plant in the Fall, because apples need a period of dormancy, so they can complete their ripening process. - I can relate. - Yeah? Well, maybe it's time for you to grow. - See what I did there? - Yes I see. Okay, you plant the seeds, Just about a half inch into the soil, about like that. I'll give you the seeds, so you can do the honors, just sprinkle them in there. Perfect, yeah. Just like that. And now we just cover it up, just throw some dirt on there. Loosely, we don't wanna pack it down. And then we just... - We just wait. - And when do we get to see something? Well, by the Spring, there'll be a row of saplings all along here. Nice. It would be great if life that was that easy. You plant some seeds, you water it, and wait for it to grow. Well it's not gonna be that easy, I mean only a small fraction of these will grow into trees. It will take years of cultivation before they start bearing fruit. And, I realize I'm brimming with analogy right now, but it's true. I mean, some things just take time before they're ready. Yeah. - So you wanna see the next stage? - Yep. Okay. So I still need to talk to Edward about sponsorship. Yeah, we can check in with him on the way out. I'm guessing that you've never picked apples before. Well I have at the market, I mean, don't you just reach up and pick... one? - Well, don't tell Edward... - No, you're safe. You know we never did finish that story. Which one? Whether you're nearing your time to move on from here. - Yeah, right. - So are you moving on? Possibly. I'm up for a position at the University of Sydney. Australia. Yeah, I should be hearing from them soon actually. Such a distance, and well such a great opportunity. Yeah, I mean, I've worked in Melbourne before. And I really like it there. - Well, good luck with that. - Thank you. You know I think I got the hang of this. You do! But there's one lesson left. Really, what is it? It's actually the most important step. That's really good. Now that we've picked a tonne of apples, what do we do with them? We donate them. - To who? - To a shelter. So that they can store them and use them for the holidays. Agriculture in action. We just need a... I'll be right back. Well you got yourself quite a haul. Noah's been giving me some pointers about Harvest Fest. - Which by the way... - Honey Crisp. Yes, I actually use those when I make baked apples. - Baked apples are my favorite. - They are? - Haven't had one in a long time. - Why not? - My wife used to make them. - I see... And I don't know if I'm ready to make them myself y'know? Actually, I do. You know when I lost my husband, it felt like forever before I was comfortable with things going back to the way they were. And especially happy things. Like baked apples. How did you deal with it? Time. And I probably threw myself into my daughter's life much more than I care to admit. But it does get better. Well, sorry for getting sentimental. Listen, my Granddaughter said that you wanted to speak to me about something? Well, actually, I just wanted to tell you what a beautiful orchard you have here. Well, thank you. - Nice seeing you. - You too. So, how'd it go with Edward? You know, I just don't think now's the time. Yeah. Hey, I have an idea. - Hey, see! - That's great. It's like a solid 6.5 out of 10. Two more. There we go. Well thanks for the farm lesson. Well, I mean orchard lesson. Same idea. Hey you know what I'll do is I'll have Maddy send photos of the saplings when they come in. Yes please. I'll be rooting for them. Did you see that? I saw that. I saw that. Thank you. Okay. - Here. - Okay great. - I had a lot of fun. - Good, me too. So we have the barn animals over there, there's the little piggy, and we have the cow over there. And, I think if it's like this, then the beginning of the hay ride, needs to be kinda over there. Okay, but I like it by the barn and the dancing. - Really? - Yeah. I do. I still can't believe those pecan squares were enough to sway the coach. Well, they're really good pecan squares. I'd be happy to find out. - For me? - Yeah. Thank you. Alright, fine you can have your hay ride entrance by the barn. - If I can get pecan squares. - Good. Check it out. I'm just saying that I think we've earned it. Okay. - Yeah? C'mon. - Yeah. - Here you go. - Thank you. These are Fire Cider, that is jalapeño and lime. Mom's Kitchen, that is honey and pear. And this one is my favorite, Fall Spice, it has cinnamon cloves, and nutmeg. - It sounds amazing. - Yeah. My name's Chloe, let me know if you need anything. You know what actually, would you mind putting up one of these flyers, we're trying to get the word out. - Harvest Festival, at the college? - Yeah, you haven't heard about it? Kinda new around here, but it sounds awesome, thanks. - Enjoy your cider. - Thank you. - You ready? - Yes. Okay, how about this. Smells good. - You know what? - What? We should have them do a booth. - Do you always work 24/7?! - Yeah, when I can. Well look, right back at you Professor. You're doing everything I am, and two jobs. - Barely notice that anymore. - Always on the go? Yes, I guess so, I am. Why would a man like you who teaches agriculture in action, refuse to put roots down himself. I don't refuse, I just I haven't found a good reason to... ...yet. Okay. You have done a fantastic job getting the word out. Well, it isn't just me, I mean Noah's been doing a great job of promoting it. So you two are getting along? - How well are you getting along? - What do you mean? Well, I have eyes, and he's not exactly hard on them, and you are blushing. Okay, spill. No, I mean there's nothing to spill. - Those rosy cheeks say otherwise. - I mean nothing's happened. Do you want it to? I mean, I wouldn't find it objectionable. Which from you it's like shouting from the rooftops. I mean hardly, it's been so long since I've even had a little crush. Yes! Alright, scale back the parade, okay! It's a little crush, a tiny one. And I'm not even sure how I feel about this. Well, I'm happy. Ever since Joe, you've put all your focus on Cara, which, I get, but part of me wants to say 'hey what about my amazing friend?'. Thank you. But you know what, I mean nothing is going to come of it. - Why not? - Because I live in Los Angeles, and he's getting ready to move, like... to another planet. That's geography. Yeah, but geography's a great hindrance to a relationship. I mean not that it's using the word relationship... Safer subject, how is the festival going? Well, I got Noah to agree to pumpkin games. Yeah, that's practically a miracle. Yes, and I know he love to have more farm booths, but I can't seem to work it out in our budget. Would an extra $5,000 help? Last minute sponsor upgrade. Seaton Orchards. I didn't even get a chance to give him my sales pitch. Well, whatever you did worked. Is that going to be enough for everything we need. Yes, including the corn maze. You got Noah to agree to a corn maze? Well no, I haven't discussed it with him yet, but I mean who would object to a corn maze. - Absolutely not. - Corn mazes are huge draws. It's one thing to move some equipment out of the barn, it is another to do thi... No! I'm not doing it. My students work so hard planting all this corn, I'm gonna destroy it for a one-day festival. You're not going to be destroying it. You'd just be harvesting you know, small sections a little earlier than the rest, in an intricate pattern. That is not how corn mazes work. They paths are all laid out before the planting. Yeah, but those are the big ones, we're just talking a few acres. You know, super simple. Making a corn maze at this stage of the game is not 'super simple'. And can you guarantee me all the corn will be harvestable? - Well no. - Well then no. - But you're being stubborn. - I'm being a professor. You're being a shortsighted professor. I'm being shortsighted? - Yes. - How? You're protecting a few sections of corn, at the expense of the overall festival. Which is happening in two weeks. And let me remind you, if it's not successful this year, - it's not happening next year. - I am aware of that. Believe me, I want this festival to succeed. Look, we may lose some corn now, but mazes and games, and music are the key to success. But what am I going to be teaching my students? To think long term. Gimme three more of these guys. Yep. Yeah, perfect. Hey, I heard back from Sydney by the way. Looks promising. Well I can't say I won't miss you. But if that's where you want to be. Is it? - Not sure actually. - What do you mean? It's something that Amy said. Amy huh? Well it was when she was trying to convince me to ruin part of the cornfield, she... she kinda implied that I don't think long term. - She totally has a point. - What, how?! Well, when I first met you at Stanford, you had just been bitten by the travel bug, right? And you traveled all over the world. But you always said that you wanted to settle down. Eventually. Except you haven't. I want do. You want to. Do you? Do you really want to? Yeah. I do, I mean... - When it's right. - When it's right. Well, I guess I worry it's become kind of a habit, you moving from place to place. Realistically you never stick around long enough to figure out if it could be right. Okay, ready for next step. Maybe. You know if find the right... No I'm talking about the bunk-beds Romeo. Bunk beds. Got it. Hey! You sound, terrible. Oh gosh, I gave Cara a stink about getting sick, and then I get the cold. - Well, what are you doing for it? - It's fine, it's just a cold. I'll get through it. Why are you calling? To... see where you'll be in a couple hours. I'll be on the sofa, sneezing. Why? Chicken soup. My mother's recipe. You made me chicken soup? Vegetables straight from the garden. Nobody's done something this nice for me in a long time. I figured that you're always taking care of everybody else, so it's time that somebody takes care of you. - Okay. - No, no, you gotta go sit. And I'll bring you a bowl. - Okay. - Yeah, go on. Thank you. - This is amazing. - Good. It's all the fresh ingredients. I probably look awful. Not even remotely. So the other reason I wanted to come by... I wanted to aPologize for being a little difficult about the corn maze. It's okay. - It was a big ask. - Well, not an impossible one. All we gotta do is get a little creative. I can definitely handle that. - Thank you. - Okay. Well I should probably let you get some rest, I mean the big event is less than ten days away. You need to get healthy. Okay. No-no-no-no, you stay right there. I want you to stay there. I'll lock the door on my way out. You get nice and comfy. Go to sleep. Thank you. For everything. - Hello? - Cara? - Hi! - Hey! What a surprise. I haven't had a chance to see this place yet. It's nice, I really like it. Me too, now that I'm getting all settled in. - So, is everything okay? - Yeah, what do you mean? You haven't like... called or texted or anything in a while. I've been... I had a cold last week. Cold? Mom, why didn't you tell me? Well, I... because I've been busy with the festival, and because I promised to give you space. Yeah, but it doesn't need to be like that much space. I mean especially if you're sick. Besides, I've been worried. - You have? - Yeah of course. Is everything else okay? - Yeah. - With work. Well, the festival's on course, and Cheryl is super happy. That's good. And what about you? How's school? - All A's. - I know. - Even in Professor Ferris' class. - Really, is he a good professor? He is. And actually I'm learning a lot. We should start our own garden. - That's a great idea. - Yeah right? Yeah. What? Well, it's the esteemed Professor himself. Anyway. - Are you guys hanging out a lot? - Well, we kinda have to. I mean there's so many moving parts with an event like this and... What? You should go to him. - But you just got here? - Go, I'm fine. - Are you sure? - Yes. There's leftover pot roast in the fridge, and some yams. And just lock up before you leave, okay? Okay. - I love you. - Okay thank you, I love you too. - Have fun. - Bye. Okay, I'm here. Now what? You've really been working hard here. It looks nice. Thank you. Okay, I'm at the first turn. Okay, go right. I like how the path narrows. Okay, second turn. Make a left. Well, didn't have a whole lot of room, so we didn't have much choice. Third turn. Right again. It really works in this sort of... spooky, Goblet of Fire meets Children of The Corn sort of way. That's a little disturbing. Yeah, well I never actually planned on walking the corn maze myself. Which way. I'm pretty sure that's a left. - Pretty sure? - Well. I got a little distracted with the whole ' Children of the Corn ' thing... Okay, so can you hear me without the phone. I dunno, shout something. Well, like what? - Marco! - Did you just Marco-Polo? Well you come up with something then. No, I like Marco-Polo. Okay, alright, try it again, let me see if I can hear you. - Marco! - Oh I do hear you. Polo! Marco!? Why is it that people scream Marco-Polo? Polo! I have no idea. Marco! Maybe it's that somebody lets a part of themselves out there. Polo! Marco! And then the other person get it, and sends it back. - Polo! - You're close. Marco! Until they find each other. - There you go. - Thanks. You saved me. Okay. Fingers crossed, ready? - We got it! Okay c'mon. - What? Yeah, c'mon up here. You're fine, you're fine. You're not gonna walk back. There we go. There we go. Right in there. You good? - Yeah. - Okay. Right, let me release the brake. - You good? - Yeah. Here we go. - You alright? - Yeah. I wasn't really being serious. We have got to plan this better next year. Or... you know, whoever is in charge. C'mere for a second. There we go. - That's nice. - Thank you. So you're definitely going back to Los Angeles then after all this? I promised Cara. And if you hadn't promised Cara? I mean I've lived there so long. I... What about you? What about me? Hey... Just thought I'd stop by, and check out my investment. Edward, how are you? Thank you so much for the donation. - We just finished the corn maze. - Yeah. - Can I give you a tour? - I would love that. - Noah, you wanna join us? - No you guys go ahead, I gotta return the zero-turn to my buddy's. But maybe we can finish our conversation later. Yeah, maybe. Okay Edward, I'm really excited to show this to you. Amy Andolini. Yes, hi Teddy. What? So, they're totally unavailable. Yes, the lead singer of Mercury in Retrograde got a job in Toronto, and the band broke up. The next time I pick a band named after an astrological movement known for bad communication, remind me to look elsewhere. So what are gonna do? The festival is just in a few days. Can I just on record saying how thankful I am that you didn't just say "no band". I'm actually looking forward to the band. What? I dance. I do! Well listen, our options are limited, okay, and I did see this band: McBanjo, I watched some of their YouTube videos, and they're not half bad. "McBanjo"? That's their name? Are they half good? If you're up for it, it says on their website they're playing tonight at a place called The Pretty Coyote. I know that place, okay great. Sounds good. Hey. Private event folks, you on the list? Can you tell us if McBanjo is even playing here. No. Why is it some sort of state secret? No, as in they're not playing tonight. - Gosh, now what? - Hey do you hear that? Isn't that the place that we got the cider? - Let's check it out. - Okay. Hey that's our waitress. Thank you. - To Fall Spice. - Yes! She's good. - Are you thinking what... - What you're thinkin', I am. Well, let's go talk to her after, okay? Okay. - There's still one test though. - What? Whether or not we can dance to her, c'mon. What, to this? That was so good! Thanks guys. This next one is a song that I wrote last year. Well I think our replacement singer is even better than our original band. Amy... I had a... really nice time tonight. You did? And... Dancing with you, that was my favorite part. Noah... It's been a while since I've kissed anyone. - I changed my mind. - Yeah? This is my favorite part. Goodnight. Goodnight. Hello Marcus. To what do I owe this late night call? I'm just calling to let you know that your plants are still alive and thriving. Excellent update. - So you liking it up there? - Actually, I am. Why...? Well because, a Realtor who left that flyer dropped by the house earlier, she had a really interesting offer, I emailed it to you. Sis, I... I think you should consider it. Okay. - Hey. - Hi. I brought you a pumpkin spice latte. Who said you can't teach an old dog new tricks? - Thank you. - You're welcome. - How you doing, you okay? - I got an offer on my house. I didn't even know you were selling your house. Well, I'm not, it's just a spec offer from a very ambitious Realtor. Well, was it at least a good offer? It's easily the best offer I could have imagined. Nice! - Well... - Or not nice? I mean if I were selling it would be, but... I'm not. I see... So you're definitely going back to Los Angles after all this is over? My life is there, and I've lived there so long I... That's I've got an appointment with Maria's Bakery, they're sponsoring one of our desert booths. Thank you for this. - You got it. - Okay. I'm totally slowing down. Hey, did I tell you we got a replacement act, and I think she's gonna be even better than the original band. Really? Getting pretty good at this whole event thing. Next year you're gonna be running the show. Yeah, about that... The University of Sydney came through. - Congratulations. - Thanks. Gonna miss you though buddy. I think Cheryl will too. I think she was hoping to keep you around a little longer maybe. Get Amy to convince you. Yeah... Amy's not gonna be around either. Well, how'd it go last night? It was... It was amazing. It was the best night that I've had in... in as long as I can remember. What's brought you down to Earth buddy? Amy. I sense a theme. Yeah. Well, she's not ready to move on, start a life outside of Los Angeles. Well I'm sorry to hear that buddy. I was hoping Amy would give you a reason to stick around. Yeah. Well... Not this time. Chloe has signed her contract already, and Maria's Bakery has agreed to be our final food vendor. I'll make sure Josie or whoever her temp replacement is has all the contact info, so that they can use it for the spring events. Great, but it won't be Josie, because her husband's in the military, and got transferred to Oklahoma. You know you could make this very easy on me. I can't. I made a promise to Cara that I would go back to Los Angeles when the festival was over. Well you two are so close, I'm sure she'd understand. But this, it's time for her to make her own way. You know, without me underfoot. If Noah was staying, would you reconsider? Is he leaving for sure? Burt called earlier, told me Sydney made the offer. - But did he take it? - It sounded that way. Well then I guess that's that. Hey Rick, I'm good from here, just go grab some of those pumpkins out back start bringing them out. Alright. Hey! This looks so good. It's gonna be fantastic when it's all said and done. - I don't doubt that. - Thank you. So what brings you by, sweetheart. I was talking with Uncle Marcus, and he mentioned something about someone wanting our house, or... Yes, there's a real estate agent that's trying to stir up business, but no, - I'm not selling our house. - Why not? Why not? Because it's our home. I'm just saying, I'd be okay if you wanted to. Mrs. Morgan offered you that job, didn't she? How did you hear that Josie wasn't coming back? I didn't. I just figured she'd find a way to keep you here somehow. I mean you're pretty good at everything you do so... What about your Independence and... I'm lucky to have you there for me. I'd be lucky to have you close by. - How close by? - Oh gosh! We'll negotiate that. - I'll be right back. - Okay. Noah! Hi. It's looking really good. Very, very festive. You okay with that? I'm beginning to see some validity to your perspective, yes. - You sound like a professor. - Well, you know... So I was talking to Cheryl, and she said you got the position at the University of Sydney. I did. - Congratulations. - Thank you, thank you. What about you, are you gonna head back to Los Angeles when you're all finished up here? - Yeah, that's the plan. - Okay. Well, make sure that you... make sure that you say goodbye before you go. Of course. Okay. 'Cause... I'm gonna miss ya. You know, it's only been a few weeks, but you make a big impression, I'll say that. Well, I feel the same way... Impression-wise. Noah... I'm gonna miss you too. Two bucks man, fair price. Alright thanks man, for sure. I know me too. Hi! - Hey! - Hey! Well... You were right, this is very different than past Harvest Festivals. - In a good way? - In a great way, yeah. There's definitely going to be a Harvest Fest next year. Yep. Hey, thank you for all your help really. Thank you. You did great work here. Not bad for an accountant from Los Angeles. Well... Excuse me. Hey guys. Was everything okay with Professor Farris? Yeah, Noah he's Professor Ferris is moving to Australia at the end of the Semester, that's all. Oh my gosh, I'm sorry, that's too bad. Why? It just seemed like you really liked him. You know what, hey, I... I've been meaning to tell you, you know, I'm sorry I brought Mr. Hugsy up here, but now I've been looking for him, and I can't seem to find him. Well, I sort of noticed him when I came by your house. I had a Geology midterm, so I took him. - And was he helpful? - Well, I aced it! - So you were right! - Yay! I know. Hey. Nice to see ya. What do you think of your investment now? It's wonderful. We sold out of apples and got bookings all through spring for folks that wanna pick their own. - And signed up two more stores. - I am so happy it's working out. And that is why she is gonna take over the orchard for me. Maddy's also trying to figure out how we're gonna top this next year. That's what I'd like to know, and our esteemed school president. - I do have some ideas. - You do, do you, do tell. - Well I will, when you hire me officially. - Wha... seriously? I talked to Cara and it turns out she wouldn't mind having me here after all within reason, and I'm thinking here might be the next step, if the offer is still... It's still... it's still... It's still! Yay! Hey. Professor Ferris. Hey. Cara, how you doin' you having fun? - Yes. - Good. My mom was saying that you're leaving. I am, yes. I mean I was gonna wait until I officially took the job before I made the big announcement, but yes I am. So you haven't accepted it yet... No, I mean I haven't yet because of the timezone difference, and I think it's Spring Break down there right now, but on Monday I'm gonna call and make it official. That's really interesting... - Can you excuse me, for a second. - Sure. - Hey Noah! - 'Ey! Got a bit of an update for you buddy. You do? About what? Amy. Hey Mom? Sorry. - Do you have a second? - For you, I have whole minutes. I just had a conversation with Professor Ferris... You did? I think you're gonna find it very interesting... Have you seen Noah? - He just left. - He left? Good luck... Marco! Marco! Marco... Polo. Is it true? You haven't officially accepted the job? I have been hesitating, and I haven't exactly been sure why until Burt just told me now, that you're staying here, and taking the job here. I did. What about Los Angeles, what about your house? Well, it's just... it's just a house. And I wanna make new memories in a new place... In this place. And my daughter's here, and I have friends here, and, I think I found a job that I'm really good at. Yeah, you are. And the only thing that's keeping it from not being perfect is your not being here. Well... - I can change that. - Only if you want to. Believe me, I want to. Does this mean you're staying? Yeah. That's what it means. Why? - Why? - Why? For love, of course.
