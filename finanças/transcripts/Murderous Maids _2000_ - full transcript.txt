. MURDEROUS MAIDS At 28 days. they left me with Aunt Isabelle. I already knew... There was no room for me. My father. I've spent my life waiting for him. My mother. I could never call her "Mom". I had my sisters... - What's wrong. Emilia? - I 'll run off! The police will stop you. Dad will fetch me! He promised! He'll never leave me. Sure he will... Move! What's wrong now? Too bad. you'll stay that way. Move! Christine... Come on... Ask her to fetch me. Forget Aunt Isabelle. I'm here with you now. Come on... You don't remember Dad. but he'll get us out. I know he will. We'll get little Lea from our uncle's place. Some girls are worse off. At least we have each other. The cripple! She's in a bad mood today. The nuns! Emma Bouin always attacks the new girls. What came over you? Tell me. Did Emma Bouin start it? Did she raise her hand to you? What happened after that? I don't know. You don't remember? You don't remember? "Peace descends from on high. The grass stirs between the cobbles and the soul is comforted. - The nest is warm... - That's lovely. Infinity's leaves are a-flutter. Everything is calm. peaceful and soothed. God surveys." Children... Children... A country at war needs all its men. Let us pray for them. Dad... Dad... He'll come back from the front. God will hear us. I beseech You. Heed my prayers. I'll obey. Emilia. please... Why are you doing this? Emilia. get up. Sister Danielle. Sister Isabelle... God has called your sister. We've informed your father. We require his consent. Happy to see little Lea? - Like it. Lea? - Been dancing. Clemence? Who told you that? I can't live like a hermit. Besides. I'm single now. You're married till death parts you. You're stuck with him. Stuck worse than glue. I've got my fair share of worries. - Now Emilia's sprung this on me. - She's on the right path. It's like burying my own daughter. Why did Gustave agree to it? The bastard! I need to find a position. And I won't find it here. - What's wrong. Lea? - It's Christine. There you are. Lea's looking for you. What's the matter now? Praying again? Answer me! I've decided to be a nun. Iike Emilia. Never! You'll slave for others like I did! If you call your dad to the rescue. he'll go to jail. You don't know what he's done... Emilia was always cuddling him. His little Clemence. he called her. Your father raped her! If you write to him. I'll turn him in to the police. There. you've been warned. Christine... Lea. promise me you'll never be like them. I'll protect you. I swear I will. Ah. Christine... I see you're satisfied with what I gave you. That's good. That confirms my opinion. Convent girls are well brought up. The nuns teach you to respect property. Your mother was right to send your sister Lea to St Charles. You're not wasteful. so you'll be allowed butter now. like us. Be reasonable. butter isn't free. Spread it thinly. Monsieur is strict about household rules. One ring: I need you. Two rings is an emergency. Got strong legs? She lives all the way up there now. Girls... How are you? Come and see... Alberta found me this place. It's still a bit of a mess. but I'm happy here. Look what I've found. I got it from uncle's place. You can have it. I don't need a ticker like this. I'll set the time. It still works. Lovely. isn't it? Here. What does the neighbor do? Nothing now. He's done enough. Pensioned off. his lungs all mush. He's done his bit. Poor veteran. It's lovely. Aunt Isabelle could've taught you. You never ask your bosses for anything. A change will do you good. - I like where I am. - You'll earn five francs more. I don't want to change. I can just see it now. They'll offer you a raise. and I'll say it's too late. That'll show them! Go on then. since you're dying to get away! In the cupboard. there are piles of chocolate this high. I'd like to be a maid too. You have time. I'm here. You don't have to worry anymore. I keep my tips and spend nothing. I'll buy what you need. A Sunday without mother. We should be so lucky... Come closer. We won't eat you. So. who was right? I 'd have sworn she was blonde. I admit my mistake. I was sure she was blonde. You can go now. Zephirine. Isn't that charming? Zephirine... Help me. Emilia. I'll never manage it. So this is what a maid is. A doormat for others. without a name. Lord. will You call me too? Emilia Papin? Sister Mary of the Nativity. Are you well. Emilia? Am I disturbing you? Try to call during the week. Sundays are awkward. I'll have to ask for an hour off. Of course... You wanted to talk to me? Lea has grown. She needs me. I take good care ofher. She deserves a better life. I pray for her. And for you all. I 've had news of father. He's remarried. It's better for him. I 'm glad. Forgive me. Emilia. You did right. Lea... Sorry. I nearly missed you. Clemence left in a hurry. Left for where? Where's Lea? She's not at St Charles. She's not lost. At 14. she's not a child anymore. Your mother's known him for years. Mr Raquois. one of Alberta's friends. He lives alone on his land. He wanted a housekeeper. Your mother's in need. You have your new bosses. She thought Lea would miss her. She was happy seeing Lea once a month! She'll take care of her. Let her have her for a bit. You'll see Lea on Sundays. She'll learn the ropes. At fourteen! What's gotten into you? Cast-iron can crack. you know! Honestly! Don't take your nerves out on the material. It's not yours! Have you lost your mind? Explain yourself!. Do you hear me? I order you to answer! Leave us... A broken stove round... We can replace it. But just tell me what's wrong. I command you to reply! Shit! You're dismissed! I'd have been mad to refuse the pay. We won't let them throw us out. will we. Lea? Fetch us a brioche. I'm going to do the veteran's place. Look what I got. They spoil us there. Just a second... Mr Raquois has even given Mom a gold watch. We checked. there's a hallmark. These are all gifts. Look... Shoes... Aren't they beautiful? A necklace... This too. In the afternoon. they send me to the farm for milk. Mr Raquois has a nap and Mom rests. They come down when I get back. Monsieur had some friends over. They said I was slim. They laughed and felt my thighs. Mother says my pasty complexion is a gold mine. I'm happy at Bouloire. but not like I am with you. Look at me. Doyou love your Christine? Do you trust me? Yes. Don't let them feel you up again. It's disgusting! Promise me. I promise. It's mother's perfume. Comrades. unite! Millions against a handful of bosses! Don't turn against your union! We'll never give in again! Beware the fury of the weak... the enraged and the forsaken. Comrades. unite! You gave me a fright. I thought it was your mother. - What are you up to? - Nothing. - Why hide? - I wanted a skirt. Let me see. I wasn't going to take anything... This isn't yours. It's my mother's. but I swear I... How long has she had this? I have no idea. You know! Your sister must have told you. Come on. spit it out. On Sunday. I saw the shoes. My sister said Mr Raquois gave them to her. He thinks mother looks better in heels. The scarf. the stockings... The bitch... If she thinks this veteran's a fool... she's in for a surprise! Chrissie... Lea's upstairs. You girls make us some coffee. The country had my lungs. the bosses my labor. The rest's for a family and I have none. Would Mademoiselle get the cups? Will Mademoiselle take sugar? I've got some news for you. Your Aunt Isabelle. the man-hater... She's put one in her bed. She's getting married. What does Mademoiselle say to that? Will you shut up? Let's make a fresh start. I wasn't being mean. Kiss and make up. Come on. Chrissie. Give each other a kiss. Come on... Mud in your eye! I must look like mud to your pretty eyes! You can say that again! Guess what. girls. I'll place you together. What do you say? Both in the same household. I'm cold. Christine! I'm so cold. Our first night together. We're so lucky. If we were rich... What would that change? Rich ladies have everything. but I've seen them weeping in secret. Get to your bed now. honey. We'll sleep better. We have to be up early. Let me stay. Your bed's big enough. No... "7:20 - Prepare Monsieur's tray: coffee. cold milk. toast... 7:30 - Take up the tray with the paper... 21 :30 - Bed." We could add: "Take a few minutes to pee." Get to the living room. Off you go. I heard you talking earlier. Remember this: "Yes. Madame. No. Madame. Yes. Monsieur. No. Monsieur." Forget their surname. And always speak to them in the third person. Aunt Isabelle said a master is three people. The one he is. the one others think he is and the one he believes he is. Always address the last one. I wish to ask you something. I wasn't sure before. but it's important for my husband. Monsieur has important guests at our country estate. A few weekends for hunting. I'll need my staff every Sunday until January. You are. of course. free to refuse. I'm not asking this with a light heart. I know you visit your mother on Sundays... We'd have to tell her... If Madame has no objections. I'd rather tell her myself. Please do. We're going to the country? Too bad. your mother's out. You know her. she'd cross the city for new stockings. Like her flowers. She'd rather starve than go without her bouquet. Come on in. She may have her faults but she loves life all right. Sometimes. I feel like tying the knot. Are you ripe for marriage? It depends on you. I'd like a little chicken like you as my daughter. You're mad! Mad about you. beauty. I really fancy you! Let go! You're old enough to be my father. So? Don't you fancy me? Isn't it a family tradition? Freeze! You're crazy... Look! - Where? - There. It's beautiful... Did you see it? That way. Stop now. I managed to darn it. You've done enough today. Time for bed now. I had an idea today. We'll make you a trousseau. A real one. fit for a rich woman. - For me? -Just for you. I'll embroider it. with open-work this big. inserts as big as your hand... With my tips. we can buy the best fabrics. You'll make me a skirt. No. a dress. A dress with flowers. I want them here and here... And here... Calm down. If you want me to be quiet. pull back your sheets. Make my nest. Get into your bed now. I wanted to see you. I can't keep quiet about the way I feel. If you wanted... - What if l kissed you? - You have to forgive me. I have a fiance in Le Mans. I have to be faithful. Do you have one with a shinier grain? A bride's satin. say. Young ladies! Someone important called and found no one in. We can't hire two maids if no one answers the door or the phone. We'll give you days off on separate days. Tuesday and Thursday. say. You know mother cleans on Tuesdays! You did it on purpose! Now you're sure I won't see her. Let me have Thursday! She's not as bad as you say. Why do you hate her so much? You think we talk behind your back? It isn't true. If you miss her that much. go to your mother's then! Off you go! I'm sorry. sweetheart... Today's Tuesday. It's only five to six. You must have taught your sister to shiver outside rather than come back five minutes early. Madame requires us downstairs at seven. As Madame once said. that isn't five past. Madame was within her rights. so is my sister. Rights! That's all you ever talk about. Fortunately. we do have rights. With these holidays now. we'll pay you to do nothing. That's quite possible. Madame. Did you hear that? Aren't you going to answer it? Just in time. I'm dismissing Christine. I won't have a maid speak to me like that. I suppose her sister will follow. as usual. - That's all she does. - Your attitude is scandalous. You under paid my girls out in the country! - We'll go to court. - What a nerve! Louis! What's happened now? It's your fault. That's a good one! I took a day off to see Lea. I get blamed when you send your boss packing! You. stay here. You can work it out alone. Please calm down. There's nothing to discuss. You can keep her wages. Come on. Lea. I'll have to keep looking. I saw the Lincelans. It was a nice position. but they only need one girl. They have a maid. Not many homes need two maids. Christine will find something. You can wait. As foryour sister. try to learn to manage without her. Why don't you take the place for now? Keep on looking and as soon as you find something... Not too bad. is it? You dropped a stitch. - Where? - There. The new ones downstairs. They're a change from the veteran. Lea. I'd like to make you a trousseau. Who knows? You might be married in 5 years. A handsome chap who'll take you out and about. Maybe to Paris. Of course. she'll marry. Like Aunt Isabelle... I'll lose her too. Isabelle... Emilia... May I be of assistance? I never take references into account. on principle. Servants aren't allowed to ask for references. so why should we? You'll meet our daughter Genevieve on Friday. She's away all this week. I believe you've already met Helene. I hope you'll be happy here. You've got some fancy stuff. You won't wear it out here. Watch out for Madame. she can be as wicked as sin. She wears gloves. too... I always note what I take and what comes in. I 've never seen that before. but it's an admirable idea. You know how to run a house. no mistake about it. The gas low. the butter paper scraped. the cloths hung up to dry... We should get on well. Helene has the afternoon off. I'll need you after lunch. As you wish. Madame. What skill... The nuns taught me this. My sister's the linen expert. She knows it by heart. - 55 for the sheets... - Anybody home? Did you have a nice time? Vienna's a lovely city. and Jeanne is such fun. You've put on weight. It's the cakes... - Did you buy anything? - A few souvenirs. I'll show you. Helene! - Where's Helene? -Just coming. Madame. Helene. do you call this a mend? It's spoiled! A dress this price. Ruined! - Do it again. - It won't be any better. Who taught you to do a mend on the front side? I always do that. Do you know how much it cost? Two months of my pay. Madame. You insolent wretch! Christine! You've worked a miracle. You can see the thread at the hem. My sister would have mended it with a hair. Would your sister be available? My hair's coming loose. The bedspread's crumpled. Hurry up and come downstairs. It's true. she uses gloves. Set your own rhythm or she'll only expect more ofyou. You'll need an errands book too. Monsieur impresses me. And Mademoiselle's so pretty. She uses a perfume with hyacinth that smells just like real ones. I love watching her do her nails. We're to buy fruitcake from Ramier now. Mom's right. Ramier's turnover is good. Look at this curl. Lea. it's like rope. Go on. don't hesitate. - I'm scared I'll hurt you. - No... My hair's unruly. it has a mind of its own. Don't spare me. - Like this? - Yes. Perfect. Never forget to change it. They'd notice a 60-watt bulb on the electricity bill.. That carpet wore me out. Your little arms can't go on... Lean your head back. Your weariness has gone. My fingers have erased it. Is this wrong? No. sweetheart. Being whores would be worse. Jesus. you forgave Mary Magdalene. You alone know the love that binds us. There's a pigeon... Look! You should join us more often. Don't hurry home tonight. Take the evening off. The key will be in the usual place. Thank you. Madame. We could live in the country one day. We can find work there too. We could do needle work. mending... Will we have a garden? Like in Marigne. with flowers. vegetables. hens... You've put on weight. Nice full cheeks... A real little miss... My things will soon fit you. You don't look well. Christine. Are you ill? What do you care? When we were ill as kids. you never put yourself out. Wicked... That's what you are. wicked. Don't start arguing again! Stop right now or I'm going! Have some more cake. It's good. isn't it? We can go to the fair. They have some nice things. I saw a funny umbrella in Caron's window. Its handle was like the head of a barking dog. Ask your husband to buy you one one day. If you didn't take her money. she could buy it now! I don't take her money. I invest it. Do I refuse you anything? If she needs anything. she has to ask you for it. Frills and flounces. that's where it would go! Lea's my responsibility until she turns 21. You're spoiling her. Just watch yourself. It's all right. Lea. I know what your sister's like. I'm not stupid. I know you've set your mistress against me. When I meet her. she ignores me now! You hate me. don'tyou? You're like your father. He'd stop at nothing. For you. he'd have stopped at nothing. And you put him through hell. I know now. I can still see him crying at Aunt Isabelle's! Leave her be! It's all right... Sit down. Do you feel better? Don't be afraid... Anger makes us go too far. We say things we shouldn't. Is that nice? Forgive me. Lea. She's your mother. it's only natural. But she's like a stranger to me. I know where I come from. She told us often enough we weren't wanted. Without you. I'd have been so unhappy. We'll never part. Never. Yes. it does feel nice. You're happy. Lea Papin. you get one star and maybe even a cross too. They squabble. tell tales. And if you ask for work outside their remit. they refuse. Ours get on very well. They're perfect. A little secretive maybe... The younger one isn't very bright. I have something that might amuse you. Her errands book. A few gems... "Baby leaks... Sal sifi... Rubataga." If they had any skills. they'd rise above their station. More coffee? Bitches! Mom showed them your book? Stop calling her "Mom". That's mean. She wanted a laugh with the girls. Mademoiselle would never have done that. Are you joking? Wait till she's in charge. Well. I like her better than Madame. Please... Are you going to obey? You're doing it on purpose? Will you open... Damn it! Shit! Lea... This is for you. From my mother. My sister forgot her purse. I'll go after her. Excuse me. I rang for you. Madame will soon be home for dinner. Christine? What's the matter? Isn't your sister here? I don't know. My wife has told me about the problems with your mother. Is that what's bothering you? Lea's a minor... Until your sister turns 21... an emancipation suit is out of the question. I'm here. Christine... Is anybody home? Are you all right? It's my fault. It's over now. It won't happen again. Don't be angry with me. I didn't believe you. Mother found a doctorto hire me. But I ran away. It's all right now. Come on. My sister's better. I'll lay the table. Dinner will soon be ready. - Button your gloves. - It won't cause trouble? The Payots' girl in Marigne was your age. The mayor emancipated her. Let's go. We'll come back later. No. we won't. We'll wait as long as we have to. We're here to ask your help. sir. Please be seated. Mr Bouttier. the mayor in Marigne... My aunt raised me there... then I was sent to the convent with my sister... Emilia's a nun now. Lea here was at St Charles. She was sent there in 19... We now work on Rue St Pavin... Sorry. Rue Bruyere for Mr and Mrs Lincelan. Rue St Pavin is where my mother lives. Get to the point. young lady... Our mother used to force us to visit her. She kept our money. and I asked her for Lea's. After leaving our father. she frequented people... An anarchist even... - I could tell you things... - Please feel free. These things are... You understand? Rather sensitive? And that's why you're here. Will you emancipate my sister? We're being persecuted! Who is persecuting you? You. for a start! You refuse to understand! Christine... Perhaps someone else will understand. I'll refer this to the chief of police. I realize I shouldn't have... They might have listened to us in Marigne. but here... She's a nutcase. I'll speak to Mr Lincelan. Ramier's clerkwas right. I forgot that rum I ordered. I'll finish the buttonholes. The light bulb's gone. I changed the hiding place. Mom's had her eye on us since the mayor came. She's put her gloves back on. That's a bad sign. We must be careful. If they ask anything. don't answer. Do you know what she said? That my pronunciation was sloppy. She must think I'm stupid. You look like a princess. Except for my face. I don't like my face. Boys don't like it either. They never look at me in the street. Would you be jealous? I need your help. Come up. I'm having my bath. I've changed. haven't I? It's grief. my girl. I've had my share. I got the message when your mistress shut me out. What about my letters? Did you get them? Surely you can stop a minute to talk to me? You've made a stranger of me. But I'm your mother. Christine! I bore you in my belly. That counts. You're sighing. I annoy you. don't I? Answer me. Answer me! My little Lea... She won't come to see me? You won't let her? Madame Redre. I have to tell you that Lea... You call me "Madame"? You're formal with me? Lea can visit you. but she has decided not to. Leave me now. I'm busy. You'll suffer for this! What goes around. comes around. You'll regret it. Christine. Iook. Mademoiselle gave it to me. It's only just been cleaned. You're not wearing it. It stinks! The smell makes me sick. It's on you now. That's not true. It's my smell that makes you sick! You make me sick too! I've docked five francs from your wages to repair the iron. You've become mute. Christine won't speak either. She's lost weight recently. So have you. What's going on. Lea? What's wrong? Nothing. Madame. This way. I'm sure you and Lea will eat some. You're alone tonight. You wouldn't have made any. Thank you. Madame. You have to follow tradition at Candlemas. We're taking tea at Madame Audoire's. then going to my brother's for dinner. Monsieur will join us. Please remind your sister to do the ironing and mend that little tear in Genevieve's blue slip. Christine! Come up here! The fuse blew. Get a candle. It fizzled and the light went out. Again? Madame will give me what for... Can you change the fuse? That iron's useless. The house could have burned down. She can't blame you for it. The whole floor... What an evening. Don't say that. Today's like a holiday. It's half past five. I'm worn out and you haven't had tea. How about a nice. cosy little dinner? Watch your hair. You've had your share. Lea. hear that? What the hell are they doing? It's not even six o'clockyet. They're dropping something off. They'll soon go again. They're coming up. They're tiptoeing. - They want to surprise us. - Do something. - You can't go like that. - Stay here. I'm sorry. I didn't hear Madame. Isn't there any power upstairs? - The iron blew the fuse. - We just had it mended. My sister plugged it in and... - Where is she? - Upstairs. You have no more work? She's barefoot. Why are you dressed like that? My sister felt ill. We thought we'd go up early. At six o'clock? Without shutting off the gas? I planned to go back down. Weren't you in bed to sleep? Since Madame is making such a fuss. we'll leave. Not so fast. Christine! You're in my home. We'll leave tonight. We'll find work. Not so soon. believe me. - I want to see your sister. - I told you. she's ill! You've tricked us... with your saintly airs! - You disgust me! - Be quiet! I've been blind for too long. Dear God. please. stop this. Christine... It's me... Lea. stay with me. We'll go away. They'll come for me. I'll say I helped you. I'll go with you. You'll tell them... You'll tell them I helped you. Like you. As much as you. Have mercy! Please... Give me back my sister! Open the door! Will you shut your sister's mouth? Our Father. who art in heaven. hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. thy will be done on earth as in heaven... Lea... Why are you looking at me? I want my clothes! Remember you killed your bosses? Mrs Lincelan and her daughter. Oh. sorry. I attacked them. Here. take my eyes! - Quick! - Give me my sister! Give me my sister. I want her! Please... Lea. I want Lea... Give me back my sister! Lea Papin... I have no right to do this. Calm down. Let go ofher. Sit down. Sayyes! Sayyes! Christine Papin never spoke Lea's name again. At the end of a hurried. one-day trial. all motives of an emotional or psychological nature were dismissed. and the sisters' history and mental state were disregarded. According to the experts' report: "No ambiguous explanation nor attachment of a sexual nature could be detected in the affection which united Christine and Lea." In his closing remarks. the prosecutor declared that their crime was premeditated. motivated by a desire for social revenge. The court recognized the two sisters as entirely responsible for their actions. Christine Papin was condemned to death. Her sentence was commuted to life at hard labor. She died fouryears later in a psychiatric hospital. Lea was condemned to ten years' hard labor. After her release. she lived with her mother until her mother's death in 1957. Since then. she has lived alone. not far from Le Mans. She is 88 years old.
