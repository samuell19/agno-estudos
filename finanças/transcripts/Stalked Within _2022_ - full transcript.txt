How are we gonna do this without him, Mom? I know it's hard, baby, but we're with you. Hey. How are you doing? Fine. Don't lie to me. I'm okay. Things are gonna better, okay? I promise. I know. Love you. Hey. Hello. I'm here to install the new security system. Yeah. Come on in. Okay, thank you. You have a lot of experience in our industry, Mr. Meyers. I would say so. I began as an installer, my last company, and I moved up to IT, so wherever you need me, I can work. I guess it's in your blood, huh? I really love helping people stay safe. We're kinda like policemen, just like my father, except we're there before the police. I think we're the real first responders. What made you leave your last job? That's a good question. I think just time for a fresh start, you know? I was also growing tired of the winters in Chicago, and when I was a kid, we would visit Atlanta. My grandmother lived here, and I've just always loved it. Well, Gary, you have everything we're looking for. Once we get an all-clear in the background check, I feel confident that we can offer you a position as a command center operator. That would be wonderful. Thank you. Okay, Ms. Greene, almost done. Just need to mount the interior cameras, and they are included with the smart home package. Interior what? Yeah, well, you know, we've got- Oh yeah, my friend Sylvia has them, and she went out of town and looked in and saw 30 teenagers in her house. Mm-hm. Granddaughter threw a party. So Sylvia yelled at him over the speakers and shut it down. Yeah, but I don't have a teenager. Not yet. Well, you know, you can always keep an eye on your son when he is home after school too. How exactly do they work? I get this a lot. So, look, they only activate if the alarm goes off. The software won't even allow it. I don't know. You get an alert if anyone ever enters your home with the alarm on, and the cameras are just a great deterrent for criminals. They make it possible to scare away suspects, and we can also ID them and get 'em off the street. Cameras actually make neighborhoods safer. So it's my civic duty? Seems like your mom thinks so. Don't think just 'cause you're working day shift you're not gonna see any action. Most burglaries take place during the day, when the homeowners are away. Okay, back door gets kicked in, alarm goes off. What do you do? Identify the company and then ask the intruder to identify himself. Exactly. And what happens when he doesn't answer? Well, in that case, we would order him to leave the home and tell him the police are on the way. Okay, let's hear it. Hm? Scare this guy off, Gary. Oh, okay. Safehouse Home Security! Identify yourself! Leave the home now! Police are on the way! Leave the home now! Perfect! Forceful. Confident. The guy has no choice but to run, and that's our goal, is get the bad guys outta the house. No, I'm sick of this crap. What's wrong? If I have to eat another damn salad, I'm gonna strangle somebody. I've done that before. It gets old. Eat too much salad, or strangle somebody? But it's working, though. I'm down 15 pounds. - Wow. - Mm-hm. - Good for you. - Thank you. Gotta pass that physical assessment to get hired by the GSBI. The Georgia State Bureau of Investigation. Yeah. Can't pass that physical with all it is juicy. So you wanna be an agent? No, I am an agent. They just haven't hired me yet. Hm. My dad was a cop. Oh, damn, a cop. Mm. You couldn't do shit growing up, huh? Hm. I'm Gary. I know who you are. The new guy. I'm Trina. The vet. Seen it all, forgot it, and seen it all again. Well, Trina, if the GSBI doesn't work out, you should be a standup. Oh, come on, Kevin! Sorry about that. Yeah, Kevin, kinda ruined this lunch moment over here. Sorry. You should be. Excuse me? Maybe if you were a little more considerate, this place wouldn't smell like a house fire. It's not that serious. Oh, no, it is that serious. Okay, Gary, it's just popcorn. Just a little popcorn. Just a little popcorn. It's okay. People are selfish. You know, I just call it out when I see it. My bad, dog. No, no, no. I'm not your dog. What is your problem, man? It's okay. Just let it go, Kevin. Just let it go. Gary! Making friends and influencing people on your first day of school, huh? You see, Trina, today he's burning popcorn, and then one day he's not paying attention at his desk, and someone that needs help calls him, and they get hurt. The little things turn into the big things. Who the hell are you telling? I was 115 in high school. Ha ha! See? You're hilarious. Okay, bye, Mom! Bye, sweetie. Jalen! Here you go. Thanks, Mom. Sarah? Oh my God. Frank! In the flesh! What the heck are you doing here? I moved back here a few months ago with my son. I heard about Mark. I am so sorry. Thank you. Well, you look great. Stop. Do you have a child here? A daughter, Zoe. But I also work here. Wait, what? I heard you were managing some big hedge fund. I was, but I was miserable. So I went back to school, I got my teaching degree, and now I am Frank Cantos, sixth grade teacher. It's actually what I always wanted to do. I just never wanted to admit it to myself. Wow. That's great. Sixth grade is when math went south for me. Yeah, we're trying to save these kids from a similar fate. So what have you been up to? Well, I'm selling real estate for now. And then I'm gonna go back to grad school, 'cause I'm getting my MFA in writing, 'cause I wanna teach eventually. Ah, great minds do think alike. What's your son's name? I'll keep an eye out for him. Jalen. He's in the fourth grade. Well, if you guys need anything, let me know. We will. Is that your car? 'Cause it's smoking... a lot. This is Sarah. Hey, Mr. Wynn. Okay. No, no. That sounds about right for a head gasket. Yep, go on and replace it, sir. Mm-hm. You too. Get outta here! Safehouse Security. Identify yourself. Intruder, leave the house now! The police have been called. Leave the home immediately. Leave the home now! Ma'am, are you okay? I think so. Good, just stay calm. The police are on their way. We have a photo of the suspect. He will be arrested soon. I'm gonna stay on the line with you until the police arrive, okay? Is he gone? Yes, he is gone. Thank God. Just try and relax. Take a deep breath. I'm not going anywhere. Thank you. My name's Gary, by the way. I'll be right here. Thank you, Gary. Copy that. Ma'am? Yeah. We just got word that we arrested the suspect. The picture from your security camera helped us ID him. That's great news. Thank you. Hey, Daddy. Hey, baby. You okay? Better, now that you're here. It's gonna be all right. Okay. I'm gonna get started on the door. Your sister's on the way, and your mom is right behind her. Thank you. We're gonna take care of it, baby. Thank you, Daddy. All right. Girl, I mean, that's scary. He was terrifying, Kelci. You need a gun. Yeah, like the one you have? I didn't just have my house broken into. Not yet. Girl, I live on a condo on the 17th floor. Burglars can use elevators. Mm-mm. Too many cameras. Well, that's how they arrested the guy who busted in here. They found his picture on the cameras that Mom told me to get. I hate it when she's right. Get in line. Hello, this is Sarah. Hello, Ms. Greene. This is Heidi Malone. I'm the VP of Marketing for Safehouse Security. Oh, hi, Heidi. I hope you're doing okay. What you went through was terrifying. Yeah. You have no idea. Well, thank goodness you had one of our systems. Yeah. Honestly, I'm just so glad that you guys were here. Or, there. You know what I mean. Sarah, I'm calling today to see if you would be interested in telling your story. To whom, exactly? Well, we'd love to let you describe what happened in a Safehouse Commercial. Oh, I don't know. I'm really camera shy. Well, you wouldn't have anything to worry about. You'd just be yourself. I don't know. Let me say one more thing. We do compensate for your time. $10,000. Tell us how Safehouse made a difference in your life that day. Without Safehouse, I might not be here right now. The operator who scared away the intruder immediately took control of a very dangerous situation. Well, I have a surprise for you. This is Gary Meyers, the agent on your break-in call that day. Wait, what? Gary? My hero! Wow. Thank you so much. You're welcome. I did not see this coming today. It's so great to meet you. Nice to meet you. I don't know what would've happened if you didn't answer. I'm just happy I was there to help her. Gary, tell us who you are and what happened that day. Sure, sure. My name's Gary Meyers. I'm an operator at Safehouse Security, and I was at my desk. It was about 1:30 in the afternoon and I got an alert that Ms. Greene's alarm was going off. I don't know what you're worried about. You're a natural, The camera loved you. You gave us every... It was great. Thank you so much for everything. We'll talk to you soon. Yes. Okay. Bye. Hey. Whoa. Security guy scares a hell of you, of course. No, no, no. It's fine. I just wanna tell you, you were great today. I mean, really captivating. Well, so were you, Gary. And it's so great to meet you in person. Yeah? Not a... little disappointed? Not at all. You know what was crazy is, the day you were broken into, that was my first day on the job. What? Yeah. I'm your first call? You were. Well, you're a natural. What were you doing before Safehouse? Security in Chicago, and then Safehouse recruited me to be VP of Operations, which basically means I spend about a month in each department, undercover, and I address what the company needs. Nice. Yeah. Don't tell anymore. Our secret. I'm sorry. I know you got a lot of people to say goodbye to, and I don't wanna hold you up, but it's really great meeting you. You, too, Gary. Yeah, that sounds like a really good idea. But I'm gonna meet up with Kelci at Java Den in the morning and then I need to go to the office. Yeah, I have showings also. Okay, okay. Yes. Once an elementary school principal, always an elementary school principal. Okay. Love you, Mom. Bye. But, you know. I mean, I'm glad to see you, and how's Jalen doing? He's doing good. He's doing good. He's a little, we're still a little shaken up, but it's fine. What about... Sarah? Oh! Gary! Yeah. Hey! Good to see you. This is my sister, Kelci. How you doing, Kelci. Gary. Oh. I see beauty runs in the family. Well, it's nice to meet you. You as well. And thanks for looking out for my big sis. Very glad I was there to help. Us too. Yeah, well, I can't believe I ran into you today. I'm actually just grabbing a coffee, looking at some neighborhoods. I'm buying a place. Oh. Well, if you need an agent, that's how I earn my living. Really? I haven't hired anyone yet. Maybe we could talk after I'm done looking. Sounds great. Okay. Let me give you my card. Yeah. Great. Yeah. All right. I'll give you a shot later this week. Okay. Nice to meet you, Kelci. You too. He seems nice. You can get some coins too. Exactly. That's what I'm saying. Let me get my commission. Tell us who you are and what happened that day. My name's Gary Meyers. I'm an operator at Safehouse Security, and I was at my desk, it was about 1:30 in the afternoon, and I got an alert... You show like watching yourself with that pretty lady on the commercial, huh? No. No, I was just... seeing what I could do better. You know. They're talking about making me a Safehouse spokesperson. Say what? Oh, you! You almost got me that time! I don't know why I listen to you. Hi, Sarah. I'm sorry that I'm late. On the phone with our CEO. That guy can talk for days, just on and on and on, so... It's not a problem. You must be so busy learning how Safehouse operates. So what department do you have to go to next? What do you mean? You know, you said you have to spend time in all the departments. Yes. I did. IT is next. It's not really my thing. You know, I'm more of a people person, but... IT. So how are you liking Atlanta so far? Loving it. You know, I've actually never been here until they brought me down to interview, and I don't have a lot of family left in Chicago, and my mom just moved to a place on the beach in Sarasota, Florida. Wow. Yeah, she's a retired school superintendent of 20 years. Wait, what? Mm. So my mom was an educator too. Elementary school principal. Well there you go. Teachers' kids. Crazy. Well, I'm glad things are working out so far. Thank you. All right, so, tell me what you're looking for home-wise. We've got size, budget, house versus condo. Lay it on me. Yeah, definitely a house, something renovated but big enough to grow into, maybe a nice yard. I can definitely see myself settling down. Start up a family. Let's get to know what you want. Words to live by. Well, I definitely have a few properties I can show you. That's wonderful. As far as price, I would say Safehouse pays pretty well, so $700,000 range. Well, I will pull some listings. But before I move forward, I'll need to get your pre-qualification letter. Of course, yeah. Definitely qualified. Nice. Well, I look forward to receiving it. You're really good at what you do. Thanks. I mean the way you connect with people. And so do you, Gary. That's why we make a great team. I am sorry how we met though. Yeah. You know, the... The thought of my son going through life possibly without either of his parents, it just... He still has you. Yeah. He does. Well, I hate to rush, but I have a showing in 30 minutes across town, so we'll continue this later? I look forward to it. Okay. This place is incredible. So I know it's at the top of your price range, but it's been on the market for a little while, so they may be flexible. Well, I'm all about a good deal. Never hurts to make an offer. Certainly doesn't. Let me show you the living room. Well, I could get used to this. It's a pretty view. Yes, it is. I really like this one, Sarah. I mean, I'd like to see some other to compare, but this is top of the list. I'll pull some more for us to see. I'm starving. You wanna maybe get something to eat? I'm sorry, I don't think I can today, but maybe some other time? Yeah. Sure. Some other time. Hey, baby. Hey, Mom. It's good to see you. You too. It's a hundred degrees in here. Oh, well, chemo makes my blood thin, I guess. How's that going? Oh, it's killing me, but what ain't? Jesus, they even allow you to smoke in here. What are they gonna do, put me out on the street? It'd be an upgrade. Okay, fine. I'll put it out. There. I'm sorry I haven't been by sooner. Oh, well. Not much to see here. Makes me miss Chicago. Not me. That woman ever press charges? Jesus. No, not if I left town. That was the deal. You know that. Ah. Just like when you were in high school, and you almost killed that poor girl. I'm always cleaning up your mess. You are so much like your father. He couldn't beat the devil outta you, but he'd sure try. I didn't almost... kill that girl, and I am nothing like him. Okay. You tell yourself that. I didn't come here for this shit. Fine. Are you staying outta trouble? Yeah, Mom, I am. I, uh... got a really good job. I, uh... I met a lady. She's a... She has a kid. It's nice. Things are really working out for us. We're talkin' about getting married next year. Yeah. A woman ain't never kept you outta trouble. Kinda the opposite, baby. Well, it's a different environment this time. Where you are don't change who you are. Except this time, maybe it does. You saw... so much. No wonder you... I should've left your father when you were young. I regret that more than anything. You were the sweetest little baby, but you didn't stand a chance. Christ, please don't do this shit right now, mom. I still can't see right because of him. Well maybe he wouldn't have hit you if you shut your fucking mouth every now and then! I'm sorry. Why do you hate me? I don't hate you, Mom. I don't hate you. Here. Find something to watch on TV. Good job today, honey. Thanks, Mom. Remember to stretch. Bye! I'll bring his bag around three. Have fun. I will. Frank! Hey! I didn't know your little guy played. He lives for it. You coach? Yep. My daughter's team. We're not very good, but we have a lot of fun. That's all that matters. Yeah, tell it to the parents. Hey, I don't know if you're busy tonight, but I'm meeting some friends for drinks at this spot in Edgewood. Super casual. You should join us. That might be fun. Look, you've been through so much. I can't even imagine. When Erica and I split up last year, it was really rough for a while. But you gotta get out. You can't isolate yourself. Friends can help. Okay. I'll think about it. Okay. Screw it. Let's do this. ♪ If you're watching me ♪ Pull up across the room ♪ I think you like the view ♪ You gonna make a move ♪ I don't make a scene scene for you ♪ - Cheers - Cheers. Don't look now, but you've been having a really good time. Oh, is it that obvious? It's really good to see you smiling again. Thank you. That means a lot. I'm glad you came out tonight. Me too. You know, I needed this. I know. I would love to do this again sometime. - Me too. - Yeah? Yeah. How about this, how about we... of course, babysitter dependent. you know? Yeah. Gotta have a babysitter. Maybe next Saturday, some tea, maybe some live music somewhere. - That sounds like fun. - Yeah? - Let's do it. - Cool. All right. So take your time, look around. You're gonna love the basement. There's a sauna and a nice gym down there. I'll be here if you have any questions. Okay. Wow, Sarah, this is a nice place. Congratulations on this listing. Gary? You know I've left you a few messages, right? Yes. I'm sorry. I've just been crazy busy at work. You know, coming up with a strategy to reorganize this company, it's just... But I went to your website, and I saw that you were gonna be here today, so I thought maybe we could speak in person. Okay. I think I wanna wait on the house. I really don't want to rush into anything. And especially if you're my agent, I don't want to complicate things. Complicate things? Like if you and I were to go out. Gary, look... You know I think you're a great person. And you know I appreciate very much what you did for me on the day of the break-in, but I don't mix my business life with my personal life. I understand. It's just that... you and I went through something together that day, Sarah. And when I saw you, I felt a connection. I feel a connection. I think you feel one too. Anyone could have answered the alarm that day, but they didn't. It was me. Gary. I- Sarah, if we could just put the real estate stuff aside and just, you know, I would love to take you to dinner. I really would, just dinner. You know, see how it goes. I think you'd have really good time. I'm sorry. I can't. You can. You just don't want. Good luck to you, Sarah. I wonder how Jalen and Daddy are doing. Remember when he used to take us fishing? Mm-hm. I low key hated that shit. Bro, it wasn't that bad. Whatever. Oh, hey, you wanna go get pizza tonight? I can't. Mm. No, you're a liar. Tell me. I'm not a liar. It's none of your business. You better tell me, or I will make it my business to get on every last one of your nerves. Remember Frank Cantos? I graduated with him. Fine ass Frank? So, I ran into him at Jalen's school, and then again at Jalen's soccer game, and he invited me out to join him and a bunch of friends for drinks, so I went. And you didn't tell me? I was going to. So you're going out with him tonight? Yeah. He got any cute friends? I'll ask. So tell me about your daughter. Oh, man, Zoe? Oh, well she's got a beautiful laugh, and she draws me pictures of unicorns. And even though she's not very skilled at soccer, she tries very hard, which makes me very happy, 'cause I know she's strong and she's tough. She cares. That's so beautiful. When Erica left, it was just me and her for a while. Left? Yeah, she decided that my teacher lifestyle wasn't gonna cut it. She wanted the hedge fund lifestyle, so she moved to LA with an NFL player, and I kept Zoe. She came back last year. We have joined custody now. But it was just me and her for a while. It was a tough stretch. Can't imagine. Well, you had it a lot worse. One second, Mark is jogging.. The next second, I'm getting a call that he... I'm so sorry. Oh. This can only be one person. Yep, we conjured drew up. It's Zoe. Hello? Hey, honey. Oh no, no, no. I'm really sorry. I don't know what happened. I mean, she was fine when I left, and now she's thrown up like three times. Get your rag and a bucket ready, pops. Yeah. Thanks. Yeah. I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so... Hey, you're the lady! Yeah. I work for Safehouse. I'm Trina. I said that's the pretty lady from the commercial! Nice to meet you. I'm Sarah. Hey! Nice to meet you too. Well, hold on. Now you look familiar as hell. Yeah? Frank Cantos. Frank? I know you! I used to play ball with your sister, Danielle. You used to come to the games! Wait, you went to Brady Hills? And you know this! I remember you. Yeah, you could play! Just a little point guard action, you know? But you can't remember all of that, you know. Look, do me a favor. Tell Danielle I said hey. I will. Now, I don't know what's going on right here, but y'all make a cute little couple. Ooh! Y'all cute. Y'all have a good day, okay? Hey, Frank. How's it going? Okay, the globe? Yeah, no, that sounds amazing. Saturday at 7:00? Yeah, let's do it. Oh, no, you can have the bread. I am trying to stay away from cards. - What? It's so good! - Nope. All You. Oh. Wait, what is this? Compliments of the gentleman at the bar. What? Oh my God. Who's that? You're about to find out. How you doing Sarah? Great. Gary. Gary. Frank Cantos. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, Frank Cantos. Yeah. Gary's from Safehouse. Yeah, I saw the commercial. Good work, man. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, Sarah and I, we're kinda like a... local famous, I think you would call us, right? Hm. Maybe. Well, thank you for the drinks. Yeah. Thank you, Gary. Thank you so much. You're very welcome. I saw you two walk in, and I thought... that's the least I can do. Thanks. Did Sarah happen to tell you that she used to be my real estate agent? No, she did not. She didn't? Frank, I couldn't make up my damn mind on anything. I wanted to tell you, though, I put in a offer today on this gorgeous place in Midtown. Congratulations. Thank you. And when you two walked in, I thought I owe Sarah a drink, because she spent so much time and all those hours helping me find a place, and then someone else got that big commission, you know? Yeah, well, that's just how it goes sometimes, so it's cool. I guess so. Well, Gary, thank you again for the drinks. We really appreciate it. You are welcome, Frank. What do you do? I'm a teacher. Wow. It's a shame you guys don't get paid what you deserve. Don't you agree? Yeah, well, I definitely don't do it for the money. That right there. I need to be more like that. Great. Well, Gary, we're about to dive into our food, but maybe we'll see you around town. Yeah. Absolutely. And sorry to intrude. Next time, dinner is on me though. Sure. You guys have a great night. Nice to meet you, Frank. You too. Same here. Yeah, he's a little intense. A little? Excuse me, can we have the check please? Oh, no need, sir. The gentleman that bought your drinks earlier paid for it. Are you sure? Very. He left a nice tip too. That was a lot of wine. Oh, yes, it was. Yeah. But, hey, thank you so much. This was a lot of fun. You know, I've been wanting to hang out with you like this since ninth grade. Yeah right. You didn't even know me in the ninth grade. Oh, I knew who you were. You were this pretty... smart... quiet girl... who was secretly a lot of fun. I think you have me confused. No. No confusion here. I'll see you later? Yes, ma'am. Yeah, I got it. I haven't seen you glowing like this in a long time. Mom. Grinning like a teenager. He was a nice boy in high school. He still is. Good. You deserve to be happy. No, I don't. What's wrong? The day Mark died... we had a fight. He said he was gonna go for a run to cool off. And so my last words to him... were, "You can go for a run" and never come back for all I care." All couples say things in the heat of the moment. It's not your fault. Really? 'Cause he was dead 10 minutes later... running away from me. He had a heart issue. It could have happened anytime. Yeah, but it didn't. Baby, you have to forgive yourself. It's been over a year. You deserve a life. You boys are gonna be pros. You know how I know? Used to play for Barcelona. You know Messi? Do I know Messi? He was my roommate. Wow! Can you show us some stuff? You know, I could, but I hurt my knee real bad during the World Cup. Oh. But what I can do, we can go over the big field. I can take a video of you guys shooting and send it to some coaches I know. Really? Absolutely. Cool! Just let me tell my mom where to pick us up. Sounds good. Hey, sweetie. What's going on? Wait, what? No, Kim's supposed to be picking you up today. It says it on my calendar. Wait, hold on baby. Okay, I'm sorry. I don't know what happened, but I'm on my way, okay? No, don't go to the big field. Stay on your field. I'm on my way. Great. Remember, it's all about control. That's all right. That's all right. Keep it up. Here we go. Perfect. All right, just keep practicing just like that. All right, Jalen, great meeting you boys. You keep practicing what I showed you, okay? Thanks! See you soon. Hey! You are not gonna believe who I bumped into the other day. The pretty lady from the commercial! Woo, she was with fine ass Frank! I was like, I used to play ball with his sister or whatever, but he had like a little beard, he was tall now, and they looked like a cute little couple. I was like... What'd you eat for lunch? - Yeah. - Yay, good job! You did so good today. I'm so proud of you. What a nice surprise this is. Gary. Wait, is this your son? Yeah, he sure is. Mom, this is the guy who played with Messi! Wait, what? Yeah, I was jogging in the park the other day, and I saw this little man and his friend playing soccer, and I decided to show him some stuff. That's crazy. I didn't know he was your son though. Looks like you won the championship today. All right! Sure did. Okay, Jalen, honey, go get in the car please. I wanna talk to Gary about when he played pro. He didn't. Please go get in the car. Yes, ma'am. That's a great kid you got there. So of all the kids in this city, you happen to run into mine? Sarah, calm down. This isn't right. You're following me. I think maybe you'd feel better if me, you, and Jalen went to the park- You stay away from us! And if you ever come near my son again, I'll take your ass down! Yeah, no. I know. Hey, hey, go play. I'll be right over there, okay? Yeah, no, it's crazy, right? So, yeah, his team meeting, it's in an hour, then I'm coming home, I am grabbing a glass of this cab, taking a long bath, and I'm gonna watch some TV. No, I know, I know. Wait, wait, listen. I gotta tell you something. There's something going on with Safehouse Gary. No, no, no. Listen, listen. He's showing up everywhere I go. Yeah, it's weird. He even showed up at Jalen's soccer practice when I wasn't even there. Are you serious? It's strange. I just... That's more than strange. Yeah, no, I think he's following me. If he's following you, I think you need to report it. Yeah, I think I will. Yes, immediately. Do it. - All right. - I love you. - Bye. - Bye Safehouse Security. Hi. I need to speak to a supervisor please. I'm one of your customers. One moment. This is Dan. Hello. You have an issue? Yes. I need to file a complaint about one of your employees. How can I help you? So one of your operators has been showing up everywhere I go, and I don't think it's a coincidence. Well, are you sure? Yes. He even showed up at my son's soccer practice, and I wasn't there. What's the name of the employee? Gary Meyers. Gary? Yes, Gary. Well, ma'am, I'm sorry you feel that way. Gary's one of our best employees, and I'm sure there's an explanation. I'll get to the bottom of it. I'll talk to him. Can I get your name and contact information? Sure. My name's Sarah Greene. The number is 382-1240. Yeah, okay. Got it. I'll look into this, and I'll give you a call back. Whatever we need to do to keep you safe. Thank you. Jalen, come on. Shower time. Yes, ma'am. Mm-hm. No video games till after. - Yes, ma'am. - Uh-huh. Hey, Frank. Yeah. I just took a long bath, and I'm in bed. I'm feeling pretty good. Wait, what? You just got tickets? I haven't been to a play in so long. That sounds like such a good idea. Yeah. Yeah, Tuesday sounds good. Hey, you know, I am so tired. Yeah, okay, I need to go to bed, but Tuesday? Okay. All right. You too. Goodnight. Mom? Mom? Mom? Mom? Mom! Mom, are you okay? Mom, what's wrong? Mom? What the hell? You've always been a lightweight, but this is crazy. Sarah, what happened? I had some wine, and then I was out cold, but... I was tired, but not that tired. Could it be spiked? What? Well, your mom watches a lot of those true crime shows. No one has been in your house? No. Wait, I know. It was the guy at the vineyard. He tracked the bottle back to Sarah's house so he could sneak in and take advantage of her. Okay, y'all make jokes. You guys, the only person who's been here is Jalen. Oh! He did it. More jokes. Okay. That's fine. Better call Forensic Files. Hey, Gary... you got a minute? Yeah. Ooh, yo ass in trouble. So, I've spoken with HR about this, and we've made a decision. Okay. We think you have what it takes to become the new Command Center Assistant Director here. Congratulations. You've been doing great work. Thank you. Got your ass fired, huh? No, actually, not quite. Probation. Does start with a "P". Then what? Got promoted. Oh, Mr. Meyers. We've been calling you. I'm so, so sorry. Your mother passed away a few hours ago. Please let us know you need anything. Yeah, I'm really excited to see this play tonight. Yeah, I'll see you in an hour. Okay. Bye. Jalen, did you move this picture? Enjoy the play, bitch. Ooh, Gary. I done caught your lyin' ass. Yo daddy wasn't no cop. He was a damn inmate. Oh. Oh, hell no. Frank, it's Sarah. Where are you? I've been calling, I've been texting. You're not responding. This is ridiculous. I'm done. Donald. Donald, how long have we known each other? Since the third grade when you tried to be my girlfriend? Well, I had very bad taste in men back then. Obviously. Who told you about this job, and walked your very thin resume into HR? You did, Trina. You did. Yes, I did. And have I ever asked you for anything? You had me run a background check on that guy who asked you outta a while back. And ain't you glad I did? That guy was shady. Remember? Never date a man named Kash. Who spells it with a "K". So, what do you need now? Look, you know that new guy, Gary Meyers? Something is up with his ass. I can't quite put my finger on it, but his shit ain't straight. Isn't he about to be the assistant- Shh. - Director? - Yes. He been here two months. I've been here five years. They haven't even offered me a raise in all that time. Are you kidding me? I'm damn good at my job. I know you are. He told me his dad was a cop. Lies, 'cause I looked it up. His daddy had been in and outta jail for all kinds of stuff, even whooping Gary mama's ass. Oh, and the other day I saw his phone. This motherfucker had a tracking app on his phone. Who has that? Who, huh? Who? He either a spy or a psycho. It sound like you doing some spyin' on your own. Well, I'm an investigator. There's a difference. Look, I need you to see what he been doing on company time. You gonna find me a new job when they fire me for doing this? How they gonna fire you and you wrote all the damn codes? Please? Give me his email address. Pow. Yes. Yeah, Kelci, I just got back from the hospital. Yeah. How's he doing? He's gonna be okay, but it's just so scary. So crazy. I feel so bad for him. He could have died, but... I don't know, you're just not safe anywhere these days. Breakfast for big boys. Just for you. Gotta eat it all up, okay? Okay. Mom, I heard something last night, and I think I saw somebody outside my door. You were just dreaming. No, I wasn't. Jalen. Honey, it was nothing. If somebody were in the house, the alarm would've gone off, okay? And don't forget, your grandma's gonna pick you up today after school to take you to the soccer tournament. Yes, ma'am. Okay. Love you. Damn, Gary. What'd you do, spend the night at the club? VIP. Look like you ain't slept in days. Oh, no, I'm fine. Just a long night. Okay, well, since you're such the partier, give you your email, so I can send you an invite to my birthday party. Sure. Oh, damn, man. How you feeling? A little sore, but it'll be okay. Well, I'm sure the other guy looks worse. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Look, I won't keep you long. I just came past to let you know I was checking my security cameras, and one of my cameras comes to end of your driveway, and you can see this guy near the street taking off a mask. - Oh. - Yeah. So what I'll do is I'll email you the link of the footage, and maybe we'll show 'em to the police. Thanks, Lynne. Yeah, that will be a big help. Yeah. All right, Frank, take care of yourself, man, all right? Yeah. You look horrible. Sorry. Sorry. Now way. This can't be. Donald, do me a favor and look him up. See what kind of car he drives. A black SUV. Of course he does. And get this. What? This dude hacked into a Safehouse account and created a back door. He's been watching her through the cameras. I knew it. He turned the system off at night at least three times. I think he's going in the house while she's there. You know what, just let me call you back. Hello. Hey, Frank, this is Trina from Safehouse Security. Oh, thank you, but I don't need- No, no, no. That's not why I'm calling. Look, I met you a couple days ago. Remember, I ran into you guys? I'm Danielle's friend. Oh yeah. Hey Trina. Look, now this might sound crazy, but I got some information that you might need. Look, we don't know if he's gonna do anything crazy. He already has! I mean violent! Look, we have to call her Dan, and the police! She's right! If it gets out that an employee is spying on a customer, then this company's toast. We won't have jobs. She's in danger, man! We're not gonna do anything until I speak to management. And then it may already be too late! Come on, Sarah, answer the phone. Come on, answer. I know he's at her house. Come on. You gotta get in. Wow. You look beautiful. Gary, what the hell are you doing here? I'm taking care of you. Sarah. Try and relax. There's no need to get freaked out. I thought I'd make you nice dinner. I bought some beautiful fillets. Sit. Have some wine. Gary. I need you to leave. Leave? This is our home. Why would I leave? We're spending an evening together. Okay. Just one glass of wine. Much better. He's there. I can feel it. Are you close? I'm trying. How was your day? It was fine. Closing was okay? I wanted to ask, how's... Frank. Cantos. How's he doing? Frank is fine. That's great. Why are you afraid, Sarah? I'm here to help you. I'm here to look after you. So, cheers. Here's to a wonderful evening. Jalen's with your mother, and we have the house all to ourselves. Yeah, um... I'm so sorry for how I reacted. This is... so romantic. You don't have to apologize.

A bottle of white for you. - Thanks, babe. - Thank you. She's teasing me about your cheese, What's wrong with my cheese. Awesome. Can I just say... thank you guys for this. This is so beautiful. Thanks for having me over. Girl, you are family now. You kidding me? After everything we've been through? Oh, we're bonded for life. And you know this, man! Oh. But what I did notice... you took the cameras outta here. You know, we've decided to go a more traditional home security route. Right, Zeus? Yeah, 'cause ain't nobody coming up here with that big old beast. - Nope. - Definitely not. And I am so glad Safehouse did what they were supposed to do with that settlement. Yeah, me too. Now I can just go to grad school and get my MFA and not worry about how many houses I gotta sell. I know that's right. And can we just toast to that crazy bastard being in jail? Amen. - Yes. - Please. Hey. You all right? I'm real good. And you guys are just so stinkin' cute. God! Hey, man, you good. Damn, man, is that your girl? She fine as hell. That's her. You got the cameras on her and shit? I like keep an eye on things while I'm away. Damn right, man. You got to have that strong home security. Psycho. Uh-oh. She all up in that camera, man. I think she done found it. No. She doesn't have a clue.
