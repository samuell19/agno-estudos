Finished. No, no, no. Stay there. Keep very, very still. Don't move your foot. -Don't move it. -Paul. He's here. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Nurse, sir. Ines, can you take over? The little girl needs a tetanus shot. She needs to drink at least three liters. -To balance things out. -Paul, we've got this. -Are you sure? - Sí. -I'll miss your Spanish. - Sí. Claro. Paul, dude, you've got to go. Here, so you don't have to wee your pants again. - Hasta luego , my friend. - Hasta luego. Aw, fuck. I can do this. A CLOUD IN THE HOUSE Everything's fine. Oh, man. Can I help you, sir? German? Are you German? -Did my accent give me away? -Your name tag. Shit! We're going to die. We're going to die! Of course we're going to die, but not today. Wow. Look at that. -What are you doing? -Taking a photo. For posterity or what? It's just turbulence. It will pass. -Says who? -Me, Julia. Your stewardess. I haven't always been so chilled. What helped you? Tantric sex? Drugs? Hypnosis? An Italian aeronautics engineer. We were in a plane that was shaking like crazy. He said a giant could bend the wings until the ends touch. And what would happen when he let go? They'd snap back into position. Now giants don't scare me. Now you've got it. Ow! Ah! Keep calm. Keep nice and calm. Nice and calm. I am nice and calm. It's you who needs to keep calm. Oh. Okay, hold this on. Press it down nice and firmly, okay? And now sit down. One, two, three! Everything's intact. Nothing's broken. Hopefully you're not concussed. Says who? Says Paul. Your nurse. -Why work for a Columbian airline? -Why work in the Columbian jungle? I always wanted to fly. They needed people, I was here. And I was totally broke. I just wanted to try something new, to get out of my comfort zone. Yes... Why? How late is it anyway? Oh, damn! Your connecting flight. It left an hour ago. What'll you do? I'm not getting on a plane. -I'll stay here and wait. -In the restaurant? It's nice here. Should I stay? My dear Julia, my dear Paul, you have professed your love to one another. Now that you've professed to love and be true to each other, do you take each other as wife and as husband? -I do. -Definitely. Come on. Off you go! -Catch us! -Dad's going to catch you! Come here! Can't catch me! -See the satellite up there? -Where? There. Oh no, it's a UFO. Now I see it too. ...it will come get you! ...to the emergency exits in the middle and at the back of the plane. In the unlikely event of an emergency landing, emergency lighting will lead you to the nearest emergency exit. We hope you enjoy your flight. "Then he grinned and said, 'Wrong. She's your new magician's apprentice. Mo and Lua, that sounds very good together.'" Mom's a little piggy. My family. Dad. Hello! Hello, Dad. Dad. Dad! Get up. Hello? -Lilly? -Huh? Fashion question. Black with green or red? I'd say black and red with the yellow shoes. -Really? -Absolutely. -Thanks. -Dad, get up already! -He's still tired. -Or dead. Just wait! -No. Help! -I'll get you! Oh no! -Come here! -No. No! Oops. -The heat's working like a dream again. -Great. -What do I owe you? -320, including VAT. 320? Really? Yes, 200 for the pump and the rest for installation. Um... Sorry... No worries, I'll send a bill. Have a nice Saturday. -Have a nice Saturday. -Bye. Julia? So, how do I look? Like a talking German flag. Did you take the 400 euros? Yes, I may have. Is there still coffee left? That was for the washing machine. I just needed it. -What do you just need 400 euros for? -Paul. Out with it. I flew with somebody I know and covered part of the cost. -He showed me a few basics. -But otherwise you're fine? -Relax. -Have you seen our balance? We've been behind on our payments for months. Chill out. I'll replace the money. 400 euros for a load of bull like that. Really? That's so irresponsible. Guys, we've got to go! The second wave will start under sunny skies. Mom! You can do it, Mom! -Here we go. -Mom! Mom! Go, Mom! -Three, two, one, go! -Go! You can do it! Go! FINISH The final meters for 176. I hate funerals. Have you been to a lot of them? -No, this is my first. -Mine too. So, you two? -Do you want anything else? -Uh-uh. Hey, Paul. Hey. What now? What are you going to do? No idea, I have to be Mom and Dad at the same time now. -My condolences. -Thank you. If you don't want to go yet, you can stay here tonight. Let me know if you need help, okay? Now we have to clean things up. Dad. We'll manage. I'm telling you, she'll never go through with it. -Ow! -Sorry. -Maybe she's into people with values. -Sure. Like I have such interesting things to say. I doubt it. So Tanja is with Frank, right? Frank's with Greta, who is cheating with Christian, but he's crazy for Ute. What weird names. Who's named Ute nowadays? Shh! They're about to do sex. -Lilly, that isn't... -Psst, quiet. -Lilly? -No, you go. I want to watch my show. -Aren't you way too young for this? -Uh-uh. - Why did Lotta go through with it? -Yes! Mr. Hoffmann? No! Mr. Hoffmann? Mr. Hoffmann? I have a cake for you. I'd be happy to watch your daughter again. "Repayment of the loan... ...five months behind. ...pay within two weeks." Whoo-hoo! Yeah! Lilly, what are you doing? Get off that. Please get off now. It's far too dangerous. Oh, damn it! -Ah, Mom! -Lilly. Mom, don't go. Please! Mom! Mom! Mom! -Hey, Lilly. -Mom. -Lilly. -No, go away. Leave me! Lilly, Lilly. Hey. Hey, calm down. It's okay. Hey. Hey. It's okay. -Mom. -Shh. I'm here. -Shh. -Mom. Right. Morning. Hey, good morning. Is everything okay? Did you sleep well? Of course. Why? -You have sweet dreams? -Yes, Dad. I'm glad. -Look, I made breakfast. -So early? That's why it's called breakfast. Go on, we have a lot to do today. -Get moving. -All right! Lilly, come on. -Go on. -But I don't want to go back to school. I'm sure it'll be fun seeing a few friends. A bit of normality is good for us. Besides, I have to go to work. Look who's here. Hello. Hey. -Wait. -Dad, I know the way. -Better safe than sorry. -Mom always let me go alone. Okay, sorry. Have fun. Hi. So can we act normally now, or do you prefer sad? -I prefer normal. -Okay, good. I hate being sad. Paul. Aren't you off sick? Paul? Paul, are you back? Yes. Oh my God! It was absolute chaos without you. Welcome back, boss. We missed you. That'll do. Now get back to work. The man is back in town. -Why are you here? Where's Lilly? -School. -So quickly? -I have a plan. What kind of a plan? Lilly needs normality, friends. I've arranged that. Take your time. We'll be fine without you for a while. Mm-hmm, right. I see that. Felix, our new night shift supervisor. -Felix, welcome to the team. -Paul? I heard what happened. I'm so sorry. That'll do. I hate sports. Don't fall asleep. Another lap. And I hate teachers. Yes. Ouch! -Hey, dummy, watch out! -Put on a pair of glasses. -You didn't look. -I did! Lilly? Okay, you guys run three more laps. Lilly. Can you hear me? Hey. Lilly. Is everything okay? Do you want to sit down for a second? You were out of it just now. Mr. Akdemir is still in pain. He's taking tramadol like it's candy. -Talk to Dr. Müller, then come here. -All right, boss. -Excuse me? -Better? What are you doing? You can't just... I'm Nora Burk, the new head doctor. I start tomorrow. -You're a go-getter. -To say hello. I wanted to introduce myself last week, but things got a bit mixed up. So what's your name? Peter Parker. Okay, Spider-Man. And your real name? Hoffmann, Paul. -Oh, the head nurse. -Yes. Okay, right. Your colleagues told me what happened. -My heartfelt condolences. -Thanks. -It wasn't all that long ago. -No. If you want to talk, I'm here for you. Yeah. -Hello? -Valerie Stutz . - We had an incident. -What? Lilly was suddenly listless. -Yes. Is she hurt? - No. -Ow! -Just a quick prick. Okay, you can relax your hand. You probably didn't drink enough. What happens if I just suddenly drop dead too? Don't even think about that. -But that's what happened to Mom. -Yes, well, Mom... A vein ruptured in her head. That's extremely rare. No need to be afraid. Okay? All right. Press it down. -Finished. -Good. What happened in gym class today? Did you hurt yourself? Were the others teasing you? Mom was there. So you were thinking about her? I think about her too. -Dad? -Huh? What's a soul? A soul? Well, some people believe that... that when someone dies, only their body goes away, and that what actually makes us who we are, the soul, stays. Do I have a soul too? -Yes, for sure. -Animals too? Probably. Do our souls look just like us? Well, I don't know about that. If you die in your underwear, does your soul only have underwear on too? Well, I doubt that. Why are you asking me this? I think I sensed Mom's presence. Drink something. It's important. Hm? I'll be right back. Elke? Can you take this to the lab and bring me the results? -Dr. Silva knows. -Sure, I'll do it now. -Thanks. -Sure thing. -Viagra? -Dude, Malik. Gotcha! Watch it with the new head doctor. She's beagle-eyed. -Eagle-eyed. -No. Beagles have really good eyes. You all right? I can't really sleep at the moment. What? I found these yesterday. You left them at my last rooftop party. We had such a nice evening. "We hereby advise you that your debt has been referred for collection. -Due to the aforementioned..." -Hello, Dad. "...in outstanding balances on six credit cards, plus interest established by the court amounts to 16,000 euros in debt." Where am I supposed to get that? -Dad? -They've got to be nuts. -Dad! -Why are you screaming? What's going on? Mom's pictures are gone. -Yeah, I took them down. -What? -Put them back up now! -Not now. -Do it now! -I have to make a call. -Then I'll do it. -We can talk about it later. Aw, man! Nothing. And here? Hello, this is Mr. Hoffmann. I've received a debt collection notice from the district court. Yes. It was requested by your bank. -...emergency lighting will lead... -Lilly! Hi. Oh! You look so cool. Thanks. I stole these from my big brother. -Are they filled with helium? -Yeah! Two elephants see a naked man. One elephant says to the other... "How do people put food in their mouths?" Know what? I'll make this a present for Mom. Oh, fuck! Lilly. Hey, Lilly. Lilly, I can get you another one. My brother has oodles of them. You're not getting my house. I'll go to court. I'll keep appealing it. It'll cost you! Tell your board that! Mr. Hoffmann. Mr. Hoffmann! Ms. Liebrecht. No thanks. I don't want any cake. Your daughter! Lilly. Lilly. I told her I can get another one. Lilly, get down here now. Go make your phone call. Lilly, please. I can do this. I can do this. I can do this. I can do this. Please, Lilly. God, Lilly, please! Careful. Careful, Lilly. Right, now come down nice and slowly. Very carefully. Mr. Hoffmann? I called the fire department. They're coming to get you down. Oh, man. And if you had fallen down? -Why would I have done that? -Come on. What can I do about you being too scared to climb up there? That's your problem. I can climb. Lilly. I used to climb any tree I wanted. Mom let me. Mom isn't here now, and she's never coming back. Who is it? Dad? Aw, man! Bullshit. Anyone here? Hello? Wow. Get down here! Get down! Wow. -Mom? -Lily, have you ever seen such a thing? A cloud in the house! Mom! Hello, my big girl. -You're here? -Let me look at you. You've gotten thin. Isn't Dad feeding you right? He tries, but he's a terrible cook. He puts mustard on crêpes. Mustard? That's disgusting. Things are tough right now, huh? I miss you so much. I miss you too, Lilly. Look. I found your pictures. Lilly? Hello? Mom, are you still here? -Lilly. -Sorry. I'll fix it. Really. Mom! -Lilly, what are you doing here? -Mom was here. The attic is taboo. You know that. But, Dad, she was here! I saw her. She wanted to know how we were. Aw, man! -There was a little cloud too. -Enough. Now go down. But she... she was here. -Mom... -Mom isn't here. -She is! -She's not. -She is! -Then where is she? Mom? Mom. Mom! Go down now. -No. I'm staying here. -This is no place for you. Go down! You go down! Get lost! Go away! Hey. I made crêpes. With applesauce and chocolate. Not with mustard, I assure you. I promise. -Lilly. -Get lost! I didn't mean it that way earlier. Please come out. Lilly, I'm sorry about before, but... -Grandma! -Lilly, honey. It's so nice that you've come to visit me. "No." "Then I'll just give it to you. Here." I often find myself thinking of that day. Julia had just bought herself that new camera and desperately wanted to try it out. Yep. It's so hard when you don't get to say goodbye. -So how are you doing? -I can't bear living in that house. Yes, all of the memories. Her stuff has to go. Lilly doesn't need the constant reminders of Julia. If you say so. "You're being unfair." "No, you are." We don't always agree on such things, but this helps me a lot. FINDING STRENGTH IN GOD I've got to go now. -Thanks again. -Sure. You two be sure to do lots of horsing around. -Bye. -Bye. Bye. Good morning! -Yes? -Good evening. Pardon any disturbance. Your neighbor said you might like to talk. -I suppose you want to talk about God. -Sure, if you want to. Mm-hmm. Okay, then let's talk about God. In my mind there are two possibilities. Either humans invented God, or he exists, but can't intervene. The world is too messed up. So if he is part of this world, how can he be God? -May I just... -No, hold on. I know what you want to say. Religion, community, is super important. How do you explain diseases and disasters? Tyrants wage war and massacre people in God's name. Know what I read? Nothing has brought us more suffering than our dogmas. -May I... -No, listen to me. We only believe in God because we can't accept that our crappy little lives end. There's no resurrection, no paradise! You die and that's that. Got it? Don't listen to that bullshit. Do something sensible with your lives. Hello, this is Herbold Real Estate. You're calling outside working hours, but please leave a message. Hello... Good morning. Good morning. This is Mr. Hoffmann. I'd like to sell my house. Our house. Um... Everything has to go. It all has to go, as soon as possible. I live at 7 Aaron Street. Bye. -Morning. -Morning. -Morning. -Morning. I was already starting to miss you. Can you look after our new patient? Mr. Konstantin. Already on it. -He's a real sweetheart, isn't he? -Yes. Felix, when will I be released? Right, Mr. Konstantin, something to pep you up. Well, not today. Soon. You have to start moving around more. One moment. Hold on. -Don't. -What's going on? That's over three grams of potassium. Do you want to kill him? Potassium? Let's take that out. I've got something better. -I've never done that before. -Working helps. But mistakes like that simply can't happen. -It'll never happen again. -I'll take your word for it. Okay. Then... Oh no, you're going home to sleep off the alcohol. A piece for you. And a piece for me. And now for the whipped cream. May I? I want to? -But be very careful. -I know how to do it. Yeah? Upside down, upside down! Oh, Lilly. No! Hands up or I'll shoot. -Oh no. -Open up. Help! Grandma. Grandma, what is it? -You don't have to be sad. -But I am sad. I miss her so much. She was my child. You know? But Mom is still here. Yes. Here. In here. And she'll always be there. No, she comes and visits me, up in our attic. Up in the attic? Dad doesn't believe me. And you? Yes. Yes, yes. -Grandma? -Hm? I want to go back home. -Malik, you startled me. -Were you sleeping in the car? -What are you doing here? -What are you doing here? -I brought you something. -Come back tomorrow. I'm tired. Did you take sleeping pills? You look like hell. You need good food. Let's go inside. We... We can't go inside. -The exterminator was here. -All right. Then let's stay out in the fresh air. I'll go to the socket, you turn on the lights. Come on. Malik! Vitamins. Isn't that too much garlic? It'll put hairs on your chest. Pipe down! Pipe down yourself, you bum! Right. Pretty cozy here. Maybe I'll move in. -It'd solve a few of my problems. -What problems? They're tearing down our building to build office towers. -I have to move out next week. -Really? -Sorry. What'll you do? -Move in with my aunt, for now. My farewell rooftop party is next Friday. You're invited. You have to get out, be with people. Hey, you're so right. -Too much garlic. -That's what I said. Paul. Spit it out, what's going on with you? I take pills and can't fall asleep. I make myself food and can't get it down. Lilly needs me, but I can't manage the simplest things. Ever heard of a year of mourning? Take your time, step back a bit. Year of mourning, is that a joke? We're totally broke. I'm the sole earner now. We've got a debt collector after us. Lilly needs me to function. If I don't, everything will fall apart. Forget mourning, I need to win the lottery, and a psychologist. -You've needed one for longer. -Not for me. For Lilly. She thinks Julia's still here. In the house, she talks to her. Who's the good-looking guy? I thought she had stopped flying. Yes, she did, for us. I thought we were enough, our family. Me, Lilly, the house. Do you think Julia and him... No, never. We argued before it happened. Over 400 euros. Then she went to the race. -Stress can cause an aneurysm. -Bullshit. What are you saying? I wanted to tell her I was sorry. But I didn't get the chance. What in heaven's name... Lilly? Oh my God! Yeah? Mom. I'm back. I drew something for you. Can you please explain this to me? -Where is Lilly? -In her room. She says Julia visits her, in the attic. Have you talked to her about that? Aren't you worried? What the hell? Of course I am. I'm her father. I had bloodwork done, but everything's okay. That's not what I mean, I mean... Gloria Herbold, Herbold Real Estate. Is this a bad time? -The door was open. -Paul Hoffmann. We spoke on the phone. Sorry about the mess. We're renovating. How wonderful. This old house! Very charming, and so much light. A real gem. How many square feet did you say it had? -1600, it depends... -Paul? What is this? Take a look around. I'll be right with you. You want to sell the house? It's Julia's house too. Do you think I don't know that? Mom? Are you here? Mom? -Good morning. -Who are you? Me? I'm a real estate agent. Do you know what that is? If you're looking for your dad, he's outside. I can't pay off the loan. I'd rather sell than have it seized. Or are you going to take out a loan? I'm 62 and about to retire. What bank will give me a loan? Does Lilly know? No, and you won't tell her yet either. Well, this wall will have to go. Is it a load-bearing wall? Hey! You can't just snoop around here. I have to get an overview. How else am I going to sell your house? What? -You can't go up here. -What's up there? The attic, right? -No. -Let me up. -No! -Go talk to your father. -Go talk to your dad, you dumb cow! -That's it! -What are you doing? -I'm staying here with you guys. -Lilly needs me now. -What? No, you can't. Ow! Help! -You bit her in the calf. -She tasted like soap. -So gross! -That's not funny. You can't sell our house. I don't know how to tell you this, but we don't have any money. I don't know what to do. It's just a house. We'll find something else. It isn't just a house. It's our house, it's Mom's house! -Lilly, I don't earn enough alone. -You want to get rid of it! You don't care what I want. You didn't even ask me. Lilly, I tried everything I could. Do you understand? You can't sell it. I don't want to leave here. Dad destroyed the living room. He smashed the kitchen table and threw everything all over. -Did he fight with Grandma again? -I don't think so. But there was a stupid cow here trying to sell our house. I bit her leg. -Was that dumb? -No, I'm sure she deserved it. Look. It's here to console you. It's all right. I won't hurt you. Daddy doesn't exactly have it easy. But he can't just ruin everything. This is our house. It's not okay. I don't want to go. I want to stay here with you. -Mr. Hoffmann? Hello. -Yes. Come along. I want to apologize again for the call. I just blew a fuse. -You don't have to apologize. -Can you grant me a deferral? -Until I find a solution. -How long were you thinking? Six months. Maybe. I'll talk to the board on your behalf. I'm sure we'll find a way. Thanks. I heard about your mom, Lilly. I'm very sorry. Your grandma told me that you go up to the attic to talk to her. -She said that's very... -Did they really nail his hands down? If I were God and they did that to my son, I'd let them have it. I'd like to go back to talking about your mom. I need to run to the toilet. Lilly? Lilly. Lilly! -Lilly, where are you? -Ms. Römer? Lilly? 27, 28, 29. Where's the lidocaine? God! Ready the defibrillator. Set it to 150. 26, 27, 28, 29, 30. We'll do it without the lidocaine. -Move away from the patient. And, clear. -Clear. Will you administer the lidocaine? Okay. What's she doing in here? Get her out! -Get her out! -Is he dying? No. Come with me. This hedgehog ball is for anxiety. Grab it like this and really squeeze it. -Yeah? Squeeze. -Oh, there you are. You can't just run around here. That was pretty dangerous. Did the ludicain help? Yes, it did. So he's still alive? Yes, and he'll be in shipshape again soon. -I'm Nora. And who are you? -Lilly. Hello, Lilly. Where are your parents? 110 over 60, The blood pressure of a teenager. Hey, Dad. What are you doing here? Where's Grandma? Lilly helped us with a resuscitation. Luckily the patient survived. May I speak to your father alone? Wait a second. Right, you're going to take some time off. Because my daughter ran off? This is Dr. Wilbert, head of psychology here. Hello, Mr. Hoffmann. Give me a call and make an appointment. -Confidentially, of course. -What the hell is this? You're tired, distracted, and your team has to keep ironing out your mistakes. I have eyes like a beagle. Have you forgotten? Look after your daughter, get help. I don't want to see you around here anytime soon. Grandma wanted me to talk to someone about Mom. She thinks I'm not right in the head. -Who did she want you to talk to? -A priest. Boy! Do you know him? -Lilly, do you know him? -No. -Lilly. -Grandma. I was so worried. -I'm sorry. -Yes. Lilly, can you go inside? I need to talk to Grandma. -But please don't... -Please go in. Yes. Go on. Did you take her to a priest for an exorcism or something? I wanted to give her a chance to talk to someone. -You're clearly not able to do that. -I'm always here for Lilly. Who are you trying to kid? She'd rather talk to her dead mother than to you. Listen here, don't you send my daughter to a priest! Lilly needs support now. Julia would've... Julia is dead. Lilly is all I have now. Take care of her. That's all I'm asking for. Damn it. Madame. Your favorite ragout sauce. -Vegetarian? -Of course. Bon appétit. Hey, Dad? Did you send Grandma away because I ran off from the church? No, it had nothing at all to do with you. I'm sorry I haven't been around for you like I wanted to be lately. But I have good news too. I was at the bank today. -We're not moving out? -We're staying here. You promise? Of course. A promise once spoken... ...shall never be broken. Hey, hey, hey! Lilly, stay here. Are you going back up to the attic? You know Mom isn't really up there. Just because you can't see her. Lilly, hold on. I have an idea. Make a list of things you really want to do and we'll do them. For real? Everything? Of course, everything. -That's for my dad. -Oh, very good. No, no. -No, no. Put it away. -Very pretty. Hands off. -Get your own, you moocher. -We can share. Yeah, but you didn't want one earlier. Hey! You're it! What else is on the list? Um... But you can't get mad. Do you want to rob a bank or something? If so, I'm in. -To fly? -With Tom. The guy in the photo? You said you didn't know him. Everything I want, that's what you said. Dad, that's him. That's Tom. Tom. Hey, Tom! We want to fly with you. What are you doing here? Whoa! You've grown. Hey, you weigh like 10,000 kilos. I can hardly pick you up. -Who did you bring along? -Dad. Oh, Paul. Tom. Pretty fingernails. You seem to know a lot about my family. Is there a problem? I don't know. -Is there? -Tom. We want to fly with you, like you did with Mom. And your dad? Does he want that too? He said we'd do everything I want to do. Isn't that right, Dad? Where's Julia? Julia's dead. -What? -Aneurysm. Just dropped dead. -Come on, let's fly. -Whoa! Careful. -Hands off. -Get down now. -What are you doing? -Let me past. -Please. -Dad, stop! Hands off my plane, man. Lilly, we're leaving. Come on. Come. I can ask for something else, Dad. We don't have to fly. Sorry that I flipped out. The damn flying. I don't know what her deal was with that. She... She could have just told me. Paul, hey. Nice that you're here. Looking good. -Thanks. -I have to introduce you to someone. -Bella, my night elf. -Hi. So you're Paul. -So nice to meet you. -Likewise. Wow, awesome fingernails. I've got white makeup and hair spray. -Do you want something to drink? -A beer. One sec. Since when do you have a girlfriend? She killed me. Online gaming. She's the best warrior ever. I nearly had her and she got me with her sword. -Epic. Then we chatted. -Sounds romantic. Paul, she's the one. We can talk about everything. We play video games. She likes soccer. Wrong team, but oh well. -I'm happy for you. -Thanks. It's nice you're here. Really. God! What's she doing here? -I figured I'd invite her. -No! -To bond and all. -She's coming over. -I'll leave you two. -No, stay. -Hello. -I'm glad you came. -Thanks for inviting me. -Sure thing. This is Paul. You know him. -Hello. -Hello. -Okay. You're angry. -No, why? Enjoy. Was I supposed to wait till something happened? -I get it. -Go on, play the tough guy. If you think that helps. It doesn't. You know what? You're a real pain in the ass. You think you know how I'm doing? You don't. I was 13 when I lost my parents. I know how it is. All of it. I have to get out of here. Okay. Do you maybe want to come with me? -Oh... -But I don't want to talk. Hey, are you nuts? PAY? Together or separate? Together. -57. -Keep the change. Thanks. -Thank you. -Sorry. -No worries. -Here. How did your parents die? Car accident. I was told they died on the spot. I'm sorry. Sometimes I can't even remember Julia. I put her old toothbrush in my mouth recently. To taste her. Okay. I can't really picture her anymore. Her smile. Her smell. Everything gets blurred. You can't lose what she was to you. And if I can? Then you have to find her again. Mr. Hoffmann, at first she was very quiet. She hardly touched the soup I made. Now she's in the attic. I left her be. I think she's talking to someone up there. Children have such vivid imaginations. -True. Thanks for looking after her. -Right. -See you. -Yes. Have a nice evening. Then he jumped onto it. It was really stupid. Hey, Mom? I think Dad is mad at you because we didn't tell him about the flying. Lilly, I should have told him that, not you. I don't want you two to fight. Adults fight sometimes. We're just children too. Children who've managed to grow up. Is that why he can't see you? Damn it. I think Dad's here. I have to stop now. Till soon, Mom. -Hey, Lilly. -Hello, Dad. -It's late. Off to bed. -Okay. I love you. 400 euros. That's the price, right? Paul. I didn't reckon I'd see you again this quickly. You're not here for the flight, are you? What went on between you and my wife? We flew together. Nothing. We were just friends. Then show me what you showed her. I need to understand it. What's to understand? She wanted to get her license. I just don't think being part of the ground crew was her thing. Are we going to fly or what? Keep your money. Come on. Step up here. Grab on tight and pull yourself up. So what do you say? Very carefully. You okay? Okay, let's do a loop first. We're at three or four G. Your blood sinks into your legs, you get tunnel vision, and now breathe easy and enjoy. Don't worry, this is a carbon-fiber plane. It can take quite a lot. Do you feel that? Paul? You okay? Well, yeah. Tell me if it's too much. -Okay? -Keep going. Okay. And now for the real aerobatics. This is why Julia came to me. She loved this. This brief moment... of weightlessness. So? Do you understand her now? No. -Yes, hello. Hoffmann. - Hello, it's Benjamin Liebke. Oh, hello. Unfortunately, I have bad news. After reviewing your documents... Hold on, you said you'd grant me a deferral. Not with your salary, and your debt. -I just need a few months. - And then? You'll get your money. Don't wait for it to be auctioned off. We'll suspend debt collection and you can sell. -I'll get you. -Get down from there. -No. -I'm going to get you. -No. -Yes! -No, you won't! -Are you that scared? No, you won't manage it. -Lilly? -Hi, Paul. Hi, Dad. Is everything okay? Sure. Go! You'll never get me! No, no! I've got you! From the day we got together, we did everything together. She was always there. Whenever there was turbulence, she was the one who kept her cool. I'm sure she'd have a great plan right now. A crazy idea, something whacky. She'd tell me everything was going to be fine. That I shouldn't worry. Yeah, but I can't manage it. It's okay to be weak. You're allowed to be weak. What'll happen to Lilly? I want to be there for her, but... that's not enough. I need Julia. I at least wanted to save the house, but I can't even manage that. What do you plan on doing now? We'll take a trip to the Baltic Sea for a few days. I'll try to break it to her gently. They'll clear out our house then. I don't want her to see that. Which one should I take? I think they're both so pretty. -Then take both of them. -All right. -And don't forget Pia. -That's true. I'll get it. Morning. Is your mother home? -No. -Or your dad? He's upstairs. Can you get him? Bring it all in, boys. -Hey! -Careful, dear. Keep the way clear. Stop! You can't just come in here. Dad! Come here! Let's pack up the little things first. Hands off! Leave that there. -Get out of here. You need to scram! -Okay. What's going on? We're packing things up. -I said in the afternoon. -No one told us. In the afternoon! Out of here. Everyone out. Out of here. Come on. Unbelievable. Come on, let's wait outside. -Lilly... -You promised me. Yes, and I tried. You liar! I hate you. I hate you! I wish you were dead and not Mom! Oh, God! Lilly. Paul. You were supposed to take care of her. It all went fine. Dr. Christiansen put a screw in her wrist, but it's temporary. -And the brain trauma? -No swelling or bleeding, just a cut. Did you do a CT? An MRI? Paul, they did everything. She's doing fine. -We'll monitor her here overnight. -What? You know that's standard procedure. We'll get her into a normal bed as soon as possible. Thanks. Jeez. Come here. In here. Blessing, blessing be Rainy days there'll be three Three days of... Mom. Hey, you little rascal. Out of the way. Mom. My crash pilot has arrived. Let me see. That was a pretty hard landing, huh? Does it hurt a lot? -No, it just itches a bit. -Should I blow on it? Better? Did you come here alone? -I know the way. -Lilly. I thought they were taking the house from us. I thought I'd never see you again and would lose you forever. Close your eyes. Go on. Do you remember our camping trip? When the two of us sat down by the lake at night? Yes, the water was very still. Like a mirror. We could see the stars in it. It was like the sky had fallen into it. Even the frogs stopped croaking. And do you remember your sixth birthday? When we had a cake fight with your friends. Dad was so mad. He must have spent three hours cleaning everything up. And remember how we watched our favorite TV show? -With popcorn and pizza. -That's right. You always fell asleep then asked me what happened. My big girl, I'm with you whenever you think of those things. No matter what happens, I'm always with you. Mom? You don't want to go now, do you? Lilly? My daughter is gone. -You asked the doorman? -Yes, of course. I have no idea. -She's gone. -She can't have just walked out. -My jacket's gone. Can I use your car? -Do you know where she is? -Yes. -Okay, I'll drive you. Nora? Yes, I'll let them know downstairs. Paul? I know this isn't the right time, but I have this idea. Bella and I could move in with you. If you don't mind washing my old socks. Like when we lived with the fellas, just with women. We can split the expenses. Paul. If you need me, I'll be downstairs. Malik. Thanks. Lilly. Lilly, what's going on? How are you? -Mom. -What about Mom? She says she has to go. -Oh, Lilly. -Go away. Get lost. Me? No, not you. Don't you see that? What is it? Mom? No, the little cloud. Do you want to see it? Yes. It's hiding. Up there. Do you see it? Can you see it? It looks like a tree. Like a soccer ball. -Like a crêpe. -Yes, like a ginormous crêpe. There's Mom. Where's Mom? There. What's she doing? She's been waiting for you. Talk to her, Dad. What should I say? You can say anything to her. Julia? Julia, I'm sorry about what happened. That we fought over a few euros. It wasn't important at all. I didn't want that. I didn't want that. Damn it. Then you just go and leave us alone. Do you know how mad I am at you? Do you know how mad? I don't want to accept that you're not here anymore. How is this supposed to work without you? Just the thought of not being able to laugh with you anymore... never again... The thought kills me. I miss you. I miss you so much. It hurts so much. It hurts so much. I have to go. What will become of you? I've got to get through it somehow. Should I stay? Go ahead and go. We'll be all right. Julia? Julia. I love you. I love you so much. I'll always love you. Always. -I hate moves. -I get that. -Don't just stand there, carry stuff in. -Yes. Here. No, maybe over there is better. Over there. -Yeah. -Good? Right? -It's good material. -Yes, it is. -Higher, higher, higher. -Yes. Higher, higher. There. It's good like this. -I can take it down again. -Why? That's a nice place for it. I imagined this differently. I do want to get out. Just relax. Here. -Want to try? -No, I don't want to. Please. -Dad! -Listen up. Did you know a giant could bend the wings and they'd just snap back into place? The jolts are nothing to it. -Really? -Of course! And now try again! I'm flying! -Yeah. -Yeah! Yeah! Wow! Yeah!
