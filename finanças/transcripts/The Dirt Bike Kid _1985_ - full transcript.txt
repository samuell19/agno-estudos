(guns firing) - [Woman] Look, you're a kid, you're no gunner. - [Kid] I'm the only gunner you got! (grand orchestral music) (lasers blasting) - [Newscaster] We'll return to Superheroes of the Universe right after this word. - [Announcer] It's summer, summer, summer! That means the dirt bikes will be flying fast and furious, a full seven days a week as motocross madness roars back to the Mosier Valley Motocross Park. Come on out, come on out, come on out, and catch the thrills and spills. You'll see the big boys busting burns on their 125cc screamers. Fighting for thousands of dollars in cash prizes. The junior riders, from beginners to experts will let it all hang out on their 80cc mean machines, as they battle each other for spectacular trophies, five, count 'em, five feet high! So pack up the family and come on out, come on out, come on out, (phone ringing) to Mosier Valley Motocross Park for a full day of fantastic fun in the great outdoors. - Jack, will you get that? I got my hands full with the bacon. - [TV Announcer] Tackle the toughest track to ever test a biker's metal. - [Janet] Jack, can you get the phone? - [TV Announcer] And fight it out through the whole shot. Watch 'em get the rooster jails way in as they dig their way through the hairpin turns one after another. - [Janet] Hello? - [Announcer] And you like lots of jumps. - Oh, Miss Clavell. I've been waiting for you to call. I've got the interview? Terrific, um, hold on a minute. Jack, turn that thing down and keep an eye on the bacon. Sorry, Miss Clavell. No, but I've had similar experience, when I was the assistant to the promotional director of the support systems company, we had the grand opening ceremonies at their offices. It's very similar to what the bank is gonna want. (smoke alarm buzzing) Miss Clavell, I'm very sorry, but could you hold on for just one moment? - [TV Announcer] You'll never forget. Come on out, come on out, come on out to dirt bike heaven. And catch the thrills and spills. Fighting for thousands of dollars in cash prizes. The junior riders, from beginning to experts, they'll be letting it all hang out on their 80cc mean machines, as they battle each other. (TV buzzing) - Give me a sign you're still alive. - Mom, you just killed the TV. That's murder. - Don't you hear the smoke alarm? I'm really very sorry. There was just a small emergency. No, no, no problem, I can be there in 20 minutes. Mm-hm. Bye now. (smoke alarm buzzing) - You know, Mom, I was just thinking. - Jack, I don't have time to listen to another one of your daydreams. Just toss me the dishcloth and open the door. Ah! (coughing) Jack, tell me something, if you can't do a simple thing like keep the bacon from burning, how do you expect to get through life? - On an 80cc dirt bike. It'll take me anywhere I need to go. (imitating motor cross engine) (sighing) - Listen, I finally got a job interview and I'm gonna need your help. - Sure, Mom. - Look, this is our last $50 bill unless I land this job, and this is a grocery list, you think you can do the shopping, and bring home all the change? - No problem, Mom. You know me! - Yes, yes, I do. (imitating motor cross engine) (upbeat rock music) - [Announcer] They're spread out all over the racetrack, that's the 125cc experts are going through the trophies. The champagne, the glory, and the gold, although, not all of them are old enough for the champagne. Number 80 right now, Sal DeLuca, in the lead. He's starting to left traffic, look it's DeLuca on the ground, right there. DeLuca picks it back up, but he has now been passed by Jeff Freeman, Mark Davidson, second place spot and Jimmy Anderson third, and they're tight together. No, Henderson battling with McCormick right now, for the third place spot. Bobby McCormick recovers. - Hey Bo, what's going on? - Just watching the view. - Yeah, I'd love to race bikes. - Who's talking bikes? Check out those. - [Announcer] 25 experts coming down in a battle like-- - It's a proven fact, there's no bounce to the ounce. - [TV Announcer] Just a moment. - The Bo man knows. - [Announcer] Davis right behind him. Enders in a great battle for the third place spot, and McCormick right there too, looking for the money, it's checkered flag, and it's Freeman for the win. Davis gets second, Enders third, McCormick fourth place. - Hey, look, Max has got a bike. - [Announcer] We got just a second here, we need to call up the 80cc juniors. All 80cc juniors to the starting line now. - Hey, Max, get a horse! - [Announcer] Trophies are available over at the office trailer right now, so please pick up those trophies. Second call they tell me right now, for the 80cc juniors. - Let's go check out this. (mysterious synth music) - What'd I give for a bike like that? - Oh, that bike is special. - Special? - Oh, yes, but it needs the right rider to make it special. That boy doesn't deserve it. I'm gonna have to buy it back. (bike engine revving) - [Announcer] Our starter gate here is set-up, so that nobody can get the jump. Watch them all, the gate goes down, they're on their way! One of them seems to be stuck. (bike engine revving) - All right, Max. - [Announcer] Mad Max is still stuck at the line, now he gets a launch and Max is finally underway, I don't think he's got a chance left. - Come on, Max, go! - [Announcer] But suddenly, Mad Max is making a big outside around the corner. (bike engine revving) Mad Max does a nose dive on the hill, Max is in deep trouble on the top of the hill, and he's pounding the mess. (crowd laughing) Zak Kelton riding like I haven't seen him ride in a long time. Here they come back around, and Kelton challenges for the lead. Suddenly, here's Mad max on the red bike. Mad Max, he flies into the lead! I can't believe how that kid is riding it today. Mad Max. - Max is gonna win. - [Announcer] What was that? Max is down in the only mud puddle in the park today. Face down in the mud, and it goes on the win to Turner. Turner taking the win, Troy Porter second, John Adams catching the third place spot, and Zak Kelton ended up with the fourth place, but what an afternoon it's been. - Max. Max, cool it. - This damn bike nearly killed me. - Come on, Max, don't. - Don't tell me what to do, it's my bike. - But Max, there's this old man, and he wants to buy it back. - Oh, yeah? Where? - He's right over there. Max, he was just there, honest. - Oh, I'm sure. Who'd wanna buy this lousy piece of junk? - I would. - Ha, with what? You never have any money. - Oh, yeah, Max? What do you call this? - You think I'd let a great bike like this, go for a measly $50? - Max, I thought you said you hated it. - Are you kidding? This is the greatest bike I ever drove. You saw me take those jumps. - Wait a minute, throw in the helmet and the bag, and he'll give you his $50, plus his BMX bike. - [Jack] Bo, I-- - It's a deal. - Bo, wait a minute, come on, I can't. - Jack, picture it. Me and you on the bike, cruising the streets, and think of the girls, they go crazy over motorcycles, and you know what that means. - But Bo, this money is for groceries. It's our last $50. (throat clearing) - Gentleman, I'm waiting. - Jack, I know your mom, and she knows a good deal when she sees one. She wouldn't want you to pass this one up. This is the Bo man talking, trust me. - You what? - I told you not buy this bike, I told him. Well, see you later, buddy. You sure are looking pretty today, Ms. Simmons. - Mom, bikes like this usually cost a lot of money, but all this one cost me was my BMX bike. - You traded away your bike? - Yes, it wouldn't have been fair otherwise. - Fair? I can't believe you did this. Where are the groceries? - Well, I didn't have any money left after I bought the bike. - I can't believe it. I'm going out breaking my neck, trying to get a job to make ends meet. And you're taking our last $50 and trading it in for a broken down motorcycle and talking about being fair. Just go to your room and stay there until I figure out what to do with you. I don't know what its gonna be, but it's gonna be bad. (light synth music) Ugh! (bike sputtering) (upbeat dance music) (light pop music) - That's okay, fella. I'm not gonna hurt you.

(bike engine revving) (light pop music) (bike engine revving) (upbeat pop music) (police siren wailing) Would you stop it? Great, look what you've done. I'm really in for it now. (motorcycle clicking) Mom's not gonna like this at all. - Where do you think you're going? - [Jack] Wait a minute. Stop it. - This is unit five, I have a 73-18-14-11, I'm gonna form a nine, 11, 73. see if I can't do a six, one, four, nine, two, eight, B, M, over. (bike engine revving) (police siren wailing) (screaming) (car crashing) (engine revving) I'm telling you, it was a perfect 72, 40, right up the fire escape. - [Captain] Look, you've been smoking. - Aw, Captain don't say that, I've haven't taken drugs since high school. - Wow. You are something special. (engines revving) (mellow guitar music) - Well, what do we got here, Big Slime? - Looks like we've got some kind of a kid. (laughing) - Hey, put me down. - Oh, you got it. Now, would you look at this cute little motorcycle? - That's mine. - Don't look like much, let's see how it sounds. - [Jack] Get off my bike! (starter clicking) - Getting stubborn. - [Jack] Cut it out! (engine starting) - How'd I do that? - Run it, Big Slime! - [Big Slime] Look at that, yeah! - No! (bike engine revving) - [Gang Member] Whoa, whoa. Look out below! (Big Slime screaming) (groaning) (silly music) - Hey, wait, come back here kid, hey, you. - I'm gonna get you, kid! - [Jack] What are you doing? (tense orchestral music) Wow. Look at that, it's beautiful. This is great. Look out! (light pop music) (light synth music) (door closing) (engine revving) (engine revving) (screaming) (clattering) - Mom, no! Wait a minute, Mom. Mom, stop. Mom, what are you doing? - Selling the bike. With a little bit of luck, I'll get my $50 back. - Mom, you can't do this. This bike is special. - Look, Jack, I'm late. I don't have time for this. - Okay, Mom, I will tell you the truth. The reason you can't sell this bike is because it's got these amazing powers. - Will you give me a break? - But, Mom, it's the truth. Last night, it took me on this incredible ride. And we rode off a fire escape and then we jumped across roof tops and then we raced away from a motorcycle gang. - Are you on dope? - Mom! - I'll see you when I get home. - But, Mom, its the truth. - Bye, Jack. - Mom! But Mom, I'm not kidding you. Come on, Mom, please. Mom! (dramatic synth music) - [Bo] I don't believe in fairy tales, I believe in Playboy magazine. - Yeah, well, that's the last time I tell you anything. - Look, I know how much you like that bike, but you'll get another one sometime. - Not like that one, Bo. - Hey, Jack. New bike rides great. Thanks for the 50, sucker. - We're gonna kick your butts in the game today. Is that your age or IQ? (cheerful synth music) - It's a pleasure doing business with you. - Thanks, Mr. Zak. - Anytime, Mrs. Simmons. (upbeat rock music) - Kyle, look alive out there, round the horn. (team cheering) - Okay, all right, listen up everybody. It's the big one. I know they look good out there. They look great out there. I know you guys are better, right? I want you to know that I believe in every single one of you guys, okay? What we gotta do? Gotta pick our pitches, right? What's the key word? - [Team] Hustle! - Hustle, hustle, hustle. Hands in everybody. All right, go get 'em. Come on! (team cheering) Hey, Bo. Jack, boy, I'm glad you guys are here. Listen, I want you to remember that nobody can touch your fast ball, okay? How's the old wing today, good? - I'm okay, I guess. - Okay, you guess? Is there something the matter, Jack? - Yeah, I guess so. - [Mike] You wanna tell me what it is? - Sure. - You gotta remember, you gotta always remember that when the tough get, uh. No, no. When the going gets tough, the, uh-- - The tough get going. - Yes, yes, thank you. Okay. You got it. Listen, anytime you need to talk to anybody, you come see me, okay? - Okay, well thanks, Mike. - Okay, okay, got it. Good, good. (dramatic synth music) - Mike, could I talk to you for a minute? - Gee, I don't know, Ms. Clavell. I mean, the game is about to start. - I found something out at the bank yesterday. I think you oughta know about it. - [Umpire] Play ball! - Guess, it'll have to wait. Okay, guys. - But it's real-- - [Mike] Come on, guys, let's go, here we go. - Important. (melancholic synth music) (jolly synth music) - Wow, it looks like Hodgkins Bank is about to cash in another victory. - [Umpire] You're out! - Hello, Ted! Ted Harper is a good man to have behind the plate, we hold his mortgage. (laughing) (snapping fingers) (motorcycle spurting) - Okay, this is it, this is it, this is it. Last to be, two out. We need a hit. Come on, give me your best shot. Here we go, buddy. Let's hear it for Jack, come on. (team cheering) Let's go, Jack. Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go, get the pitch in. Come on, here we go, come on, Jack, come on boy. Get a pitch in. - [Umpire] Strike one. - All right, no sweat. Okay, Jack, good swing, good swing. - Your swing's about as rusty as that old bike I sold you. (motorcycle engine revving) - Bo, it's my bike. (team cheering) (team cheering) (upbeat synth music) - Throw it in. Throw the ball in. - You're out! - [Jack] Come on, he blocked the plate. - [Max] Hey, come on, you little runt. I'm gonna throw the whole plate on you. Come here, you little runt, come on. - [Bo] Jack! - All right, wait, hold it, hold it. Alright, alright, come on. He was safe, he had safe. Safe, did you see that? Listen, he dropped the ball, he pinned him down, that's not fair. Come on, Ms. Clavell, you saw what happened. Tell him what happened, go ahead, come on. - I didn't get a good view of the play. - I said he was out. This game's over. (team cheering) - Wasn't even close. (melancholic synth music) - Well, Bo, what do you think? - This is the bike you bought? - It sure is. Isn't it great? - But I thought your mom sold it. - I did too. I guess she just must have changed her mind and then left it here as a surprise. - Mothers can be so bizarre. - They sure can. How would you like to go for a ride, Bo? - All right. - Hop on. - Max. (silly synth music) - [Max] Yes, sir? - If you persist in this poor sportsmanship, this under handed behavior, you'll make a superb bank executive someday. (motor cycle engine revving) Ah! (upbeat rock music) - Boy, that rides great. It's a terrific bike. - Thanks. - I want to have one. - Come on, Bo, the food fight's starting. - Wait a second. Hey girls, wanna see my bike? - Your bike? I thought it was Jack's. - No, I was just letting him drive it. - Well, how bout taking me for a ride? - Sure. (engines revving) (engine revving) - Whoa. (upbeat rock music) (kids laughing) - Mike, will you please let me explain the bank's position on this? Mr. Hodgkins and the board-- - Ah, missed me. All right, this one's for you Hodgkins. Come on, come on, huh? One for good luck. All right, all right. All right, everybody out here right now. Let's go, everybody, get moving, come on. Come on. - [Boy] Damn. - [Kid] What's his problem? - Mike, I just-- - What's the matter, Mike? I've never seen you so steamed. - Why don't you ask Mr. Hodgkins' personal assistant? - Comprehensive analysis made by the bank's computer selected this site as the location for the new bank. Mr. Hodgkins' has given Mike one week to vacate before they tear down the Dog House. But I'm sure Mike will be able-- - You're sure Mike will what? Go on, Ms. Clavell, what? Don't you understand? Don't you and your computer understand I'm about to lose everything in my life, everything I've worked for? Or don't things like that compute in your comprehensive analysis, huh? - I'm sorry. - Mike, you can't let them get away with this. - Yeah, you've gotta fight it. - I don't know, guys. I mean, when the bank says you're out, you're out. That's it. - Ms. Clavell, can't you do something? - There isn't anything I can do. - But if you kick Mike out of the Dog House, then what will he do? - Where are we gonna hang out, Al's Grill? - Can't you stop them? - I'm just an employee, Jack. I'm not the boss. (engine revving) - What are you doing? Stop it. I'm really sorry, Ms. Clavell. - It's okay, I just wish there was something I could do. - [Jack] We aren't gonna let this happen to Mike. Now, we've gotta do something. - What? - [Jack] I don't know. (engine revving) (upbeat orchestral music) (bright orchestral music) (imitating car engine) - My little Hodgkins, I'll barbecue the first pigeon that touches you. (knocking on door) - Yes? - Mr. Hodgkins, shall I send in the next applicant? - Yes. (light orchestral music) - Janet Simmons, Mr. Hodgkins. - What a pleasure. - It's nice to meet you. - She's got excellent credentials. - Yes, I see that. Please. (woman screaming) - [Guard] Hey. (bike engine revving) (people yelling) - Well, I don't see any reason why I can't start tomorrow. - Oh, that's wonderful. Ms. Simmons, Janet. You certainly have all the qualifications to be a Hodgkins girl. - Thank you, Mr. Hodgkins. - Hey, here's an idea. Why don't we start by taking a dinner meeting at my house? (speaking foreign language) - Oh, well. - Let's just seal our little deal with a little toast. God, what in God's name are you doing? - Mom. - This is your son? - Well, he looks vaguely familiar. Jack, what are you doing? - I don't know. - What you do mean you don't know? - Excuse me. - Mom, the bike brought me here. - Jack, if you took this bike from Mr. Zak's shop-- - Excuse me. - Mom, I swear, I didn't. - Excuse me, just one second. What are we doing with a motorcycle in my office? - How come you're throwing Mike out of his store? That's a real slimy thing to do. - Guard! - Jack, you've gotta take this motorcycle back to Mr. Zak. It's his now. - I tried to stop him, Mr. Hodgkins. - Take Evel Knievel and bounce him the hell out of here. My bank! My statue! - Oh, Jack. Oh, Mr. Hodgkins, I really am very sorry. - Get out. - Hey, hey you, get out of here you little brat kid. - And stay out! (silly synth music) - He killed my little Hodgkins. (engine revving) - I'm sorry, but I don't wanna do this either. But I've gotta take you back. I have to do what mom says. (engine sputtering) - I'll never get caught up, these kids today, you just can't depend on them. Be right with you, lady. - Mr. Zak? I've gotta bring back my bike. - I'll give you 50 bucks for it. Take it or leave it. - But you already own it. - Oh well, that's different then. Let me have it then. Out of the way, I gotta get this. I can't get anybody to help me and I'm way behind. Be with you, just a moment lady. Just can't depend on them anymore. - I just can't leave you here, buddy. (engine sputtering) I've gotta do something. Excuse me, Mr. Zak? - You still standing around? - I wanna buy back the bike. - Make me an offer, that's my business. - How about $50? - Sold. - There's only one thing though. - Yeah? - I don't have any money. - Oh, well, you come back when you do. - Wait, maybe I can work off the $50. I could answer the phone, or I could clean up, or I could even do deliveries for you. Please, Mr. Zak, I could be a big help. - It's a deal. (upbeat dance music) - You take this up to 674. I'll meet you across the street. (bike engine revving) Mom, I did take the bike back. - Then what is it doing here? - Mr. Zak said I could earn the bike back if I did deliveries for him. - And I can call Mr. Zak, and he'll confirm this? - Right. - Oh, Jack. I don't know if I want this bike around. You've been acting weird ever since you've got it. - Mom, I promise, I won't cause anymore trouble. - Why did you barge into Mr. Hodgkins's office like that? - Because he's kicking Mike out of the store and that isn't fair. - But you don't just blast into someone's office like that. You make an appointment, you talk to them, you go through the system. (engine sputtering) - Mom, from now on, I will. And I swear, I won't cause anymore trouble. Mom, I'm really sorry about costing you that job. Really, I am. (light orchestral music) - It doesn't matter. I don't think I could've lasted very long with Mr. Hodgkins anyway. He wasn't interested in my abilities. - What was he interested in? - Nevermind. - Oh, that. (engine sputtering) Then I can keep the bike? - No more trouble? - Oh, you're the best mom in the world, and I'm gonna be the best kid. - [Janet] Yeah. - Come on, if we're gonna talk to Hodgkins, we've gotta come here. Come on, stop fighting me, okay? Try things my way. Why do you always have to go on and head on into the things? We should do what Mom says and go through the systems. Now, this is the right way of doing things. (engine sputtering) Trust me. Stay here and keep out of trouble. I'll be right back. Stay here. - It started with a piggy bank for Christmas, then my own subscription to The Wall Street Journal, my first rental property, my first foreclosure, and the rest is financial history. But so what if bank presidents are fabulously wealthy? We need love, just like ordinary men. (door bell ringing) - There's someone at the door. (speaking foreign language) (light orchestral music) - You. - Hello, Mr. Hodgkins. - Well, I can see you two have got a lot to talk about so I'll just be running along. (whistling) (dog barking) - Good dog. Now back off, Scrooge, she's mine. Why don't you select a nice whine for dinner, ma cheri? And as for you, what you did the other-- - Please, Mr. Hodgkins. I just came over here to say that I'm very sorry for driving into your office and everything. - I see. Well, I suppose it takes a big man to admit that he was wrong. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm in the middle of a very important business conference. - Oh, wait. One more thing Mr. Hodgkins, I was just wondering, if maybe you could do something to help Mike save the Dog House? (scoffing) - Little boy, the decision to evict, Mike, was made by the board of directors. (woman grunting) There's a impertinent Beaujolais in the cabinet, (speaking in foreign language). - I'm having a hard time choosing. - Bye bye. (glass shattering) - Mr. Hodgkins, do you think that maybe I can go and speak with the board of directors? - Yes, of course, anything you say. Goodbye. - When is the next meeting? - Tomorrow, great seeing you, I'm sure you'll make a fine citizen if you grow up. - Can I go and speak with them tomorrow? - Dandy, fine and dandy, goodbye. (light orchestral music) ♪ Who's that knocking at your door ♪ ♪ Who's that knocking at your door ♪ ♪ Who's that ♪ (knocking on door) ♪ At your door ♪ ♪ Just a love sick president ♪ Did you choose a wine, my... (record scratching) Damn. That's the second one today. I've gotta put bars on these windows. - Come on now, you're just jealous because I've got a meeting with the board of directors. (engine revving) I told you Mom was right. It works every time if you go through the system. Oh, what's the matter with you? Don't be a nerd. Oh, I guess I've hurt your feelings now. Well, I'm not gonna take it back. You've got to learn to do things the right way. (motorcycles revving) (gentle guitar music) Come on, let's get out of here. Come on! Come on, let's get out of here. - I told you I was gon' get you, didn't I, kid? - [Jack] You're gonna get me slaughtered. - Oh, what's the matter? Is your bike busted? (gang laughing) - [Jack] Look, I'm very sorry and I promise, I'll never call you a nerd again, I swear. (bike engine revving) - How does he do that? (light orchestral music) - Well, that's wonderful, Harriett. You must be very proud of Riley. Well, I'm sure he's gonna make a very fine milk monitor. Oh, Jack's really coming around. We had a very productive talk. Very productive, excuse me, Harriett. Jack, where are going in that suit? - There's no time to talk, Mom. I've got a meeting with the board of directors at the bank. - The board of directors at the... Jack! (engine revving) - [Harriett] A board of directors at the bank? Oh my God, Janet, you must be so proud. (light orchestral music) - Gentlemen. Gentlemen, it's about time for that press conference I called, so let's get this little matter of the softball team out of the way. Now, I've already given you my opinion, so let's put it to a vote. - Go, get them, RJ! - All those in favor of allowing women on the bank's softball team, say aye. Those opposed? - [All] Nay! - Ah, so, it's bye bye, bimbos. (all laughing) - You're beautiful, RJ. (knocking on door) - Yes? - Excuse me, Mr. Hodgkins, Jack Simmons is here. He says he has an appointment with the board. - Simmons? No, I never heard of him. - Well, you know Jack, Mr. Hodgkins. He's-- - Don't contradict me, Ms. Clavell. Now, tell him to run along. Send those reporters in now. - But I-- - Now. Don't tilt it. Keep it neat, keep it neat. Good, good, good, get out, get out. Welcome! Ladies and gentlemen, please, come in. Gather around, don't be shy, the best seats are up front. (speaking foreign language) - Believe me, Jack, I did the best I could. I don't know what to say, Mike. I'm sorry. - Yeah, I know you're sorry, I'm sorry, everybody's sorry. That doesn't do me much good though, does it? - He told me that I could see the board of directors, Mike. He lied to me, he just plain lied. - I know, what else is new, huh? - [Jack] I guess being a rebel is the only way to get things done around here. - What? (upbeat synth music) Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What are you doing? - [Jack] Look out! (group applauding) - Thank you, a it gives me chills just to think of it. So, today, I have a very exciting announcement to make. - [Guard] I thought I told you to stay out! - Dear friends of the press, I humbly present the new Hodgkins Bank. (gasping) (people applauding) (engine revving) (woman screaming) - You. (engine revving) (light orchestral music) You. - I'm very sorry, Mr. Hodgkins, but I did have an appointment. - Hodgkins, what's this all about? - [Woman] Yes, Mr. Hodgkins. - [Man] Tell us the story. - [Press] Yeah, people wanna know, Hodgkins. - [Man] Yeah, exactly. - Just a little entertainment for you hard working folks of the fourth estate. Hey, who says press conferences have to be dull? There's no business like bank business. Yes, sir! (laughing) - Yeah, but what about Mike's Dog House? - Come on, let's talk. - What's going on? What's going on? Is Jack in there? Is he all right? - He's fine, the board's listening to him. - They're listening to him? - That's a good sign. - Come on, Ms. Clavell, you don't really think Jack's gonna change anybody's mind, do you? - That's possible. - Yeah, via wave of a magic wand, maybe. - What's the matter, you don't believe in magic? - Maybe I used to, but not anymore. (people applauding) - We did it, Mike, the Dog House is saved. - What's he talking about? - Well, young Jack here has convinced me, and the board, that before the bank destroys so beloved an institution as-- - Mike's Dog House. - Your Dog House, that it had been pretty darn sure it knows what it's doing. - You mean, I can-- - Mike, you have my personal assurance that the board of directors will do everything it can to find an alternative site for our new branch. I've already ordered our computer to start the search. - That Hodgkins is a hell of a guy. - Oh, thank you. Come on. (people applauding) God bless you, thank you. Thank you so much, thank you. - Gee, I don't know what to say. - Now do you believe in magic? - Well, yeah, I mean now. Hey, Jack. (kids cheering) - Shh. I'd like to say that the Dog House would have gone down the tubes if weren't for my good friend, Jack, right here, huh? Let's hear it! (kids cheering) We want Jack. - [All] We want Jack! We want Jack! We want Jack! - I know that kid. - Oh yeah? - Yeah, he's a jerk. - [All] We want Jack! We want Jack! We want Jack! - This is the greatest moment of my life. - [All] Aw. - Come on. Well, first of all, I would like to thank my mother who has been so supportive through all of this. - All right! - So, it's your mom, huh? - And also, I'd like to thank my best friend, Bo. - [Girl] All right, Bo. (engine sputtering) - Oh yeah, and I would also like to thank Max, for being nice enough to sell me this bike, which has made it all possible. - [All] All right! (kids cheering) (light orchestral music) - Get the blueprints for the building. Look alive! A little higher, a little higher. - What's going on, Mike? - Bank foreclosed. Hodgkins says they're gonna start tearing it down noon tomorrow. - Mr. Hodgkins. Mr. Hodgkins, you can't do this. You promised me that you wouldn't. - What I said, was that I would explore alternate sites. I did, and gosh, there just aren't any. - But how do you know that for sure? - It was all done by computer, and our data shows, beyond a doubt, this is the ideal location for our new branch. Right, Ms. Clavell? - Yes, sir. That's what the print out you showed to the board said. - But it could've made a mistake. How about letting me look at the bank's computers? (laughing) - You? - I got an A in computer science, and maybe I can find something that you guys missed. Please, Mr. Hodgkins. - Look, look, sonny, I'm sure you're a real wiz kid, but I programmed the computer myself so there can't be a mistake. Now, run along home before I make you part of the foundation. (bike engine revving) You keep this piece of junk away from me before I have it demolished. - But you can't tear down Mike's store! - Don't take it so hard, Jack. You did the best you could. - Yeah, in this life, I guess you just gotta know when to quit. - [Jack] Not me. - What a great day for Mrs. Hodgkins's baby boy. Ms. Clavell, come here. (tense synth music) Take my picture. - [Construction Worker] Hey, hey, what are you doing? Come back here, you little runt. - Officer, arrest that punk! - Yes, sir. (fast-paced synth music) This is unit seven. I'm on a nine, 11 with a kid 40 the bank on his left one niner, now he just 360, a 592, over. - [Captain] Harvey, you wanna get your patrol car back, catch that kid. - Roger, chief. (car honking) - [Jogger] Whoa! - Three, 18, seven, 14, 11. I'm gonna perform a nine, 11, seven, three. See if I can't six, one, four, nine, eight, two, ABM, over. Wow. (screaming) (laughing) - [Jack] Whoo! - Chief, this is Flaherty. I lost the kid. - Where the hell are you, Flaherty? - Well, I'm a, actually, I'm on top of a truck. - Take my advice, Flaherty. Stay there. - Okay. (grand orchestral music) - [Jack] Wow, lets go downtown. Woo! All right. Wow. We're going right over Hodgkins Bank. Oh man. Whoa, this is great. Uh-oh, where are we gonna land? Woo, hoo-hoo! - Hi, honey. How you doing? - [Jack] Oh fine, thanks, Mom. Sorry that I'm late. - That's okay. What have you been up to? - Oh, I was just busy. - Busy? - Yeah. - Doing what? - Wasn't any big deal. - It wasn't? What wasn't? - What I was doing. - Oh. (police siren wailing) (tense orchestral music) - [Mr. Hodgkins] The bike, Chief, arrest it. - Flaherty. - [Jack] No, not my bike. - You can't just come in here and take his bike away like this. - Show her the warrant, Chief. Your juvenile delinquent son almost destroyed the bank's construction trailer today with his damn bike. - He lied to me about tearing down Mike's place. - Until that eye sore is obliterated tomorrow, I want that mechanical menace degassed, de-oiled, debilitated and locked up. (motorcycle revving) - The bike will be at the city jail, ma'am. The bail will be 100 bucks if you want it back. - But I'll never have that kind of money. - And if you don't want your little boy locked up too, you'd better keep him away from the construction site. - Don't worry, he won't come near it. - Mom. - Ah, don't say anything, I won't either. (somber orchestral music) (engine sputtering) (melancholic orchestral music) (engine sputtering) (knocking on door) Honey, your dinner's on the table, don't let it get cold. Look, I gotta go to a late job interview. I'll be back in a couple hours. (tense orchestral music) - No! (phone ringing) Hello? Yes, this is Jack. What? Yes, sir, I can be there in 10 minutes. (light synth music) Hi, I'm Jack Simmons and somebody said that I could get my bike back. - It's down the hall. Just make sure you keep it out of trouble. Okay, Joe, you can cut it loose. (light synth music) - Gosh, I really never thought I'd see you again. - I see you got your friend back. - Mike, it was you? I don't know how I'll do it, but I'll try to pay you back someday, really. - Hold on, hold on, I didn't spring your bike. - Well, then who did? - Ms. Clavell, you? - I can't stop him from taking Mike's hotdog store, but I can stop him from taking your bike. Be sure you take it straight home. - I'm already there. You're the best, Ms. Clavell. - You know you are. (motorcycle revving) How about if I buy you a cup of coffee. - I'd love it. - Yeah, okay. - Hey, home's the other way. (ominous synth music) Stop it, stop it! You wanna go back to jail? Don't, don't! Now we're in for it. What the heck's the matter with you? You don't understand that this isn't gonna do any good. All they're gonna do is put a new fence, and then rip down Mike's place, and the only thing you can do is get me in a lot of trouble. Oh, come on, let's get out of here. (engine revving) Where do you think you're going? Come on now, I don't wanna play games. Get over here, right now. That's more like it, buddy. Come on, let's go home. (engine revving) Hey! Go on, take off, see if I care. You're nothing but trouble anyway. I don't want you anymore. You hear me? I don't want you! (grunting) - Oh boy, am I pooped. (light synth music) Jack. I know you miss the bike, but you gotta eat. - I don't miss that bike. I hate that bike. I don't ever wanna see it again. I don't wanna talk about it. - Jack, honey. First, he loves the bike and now he hates the bike. I don't know. Honey? (tense synth music) - Hell hath no wrath like Hodgkins when he's pissed off. That little monster will pay for all of this, with interest. - Mr. Hodgkins. - I want that bike confiscated for life. - We're doing the best we can, Mr. Hodgkins. - Well, you better do better than that because I don't want any problems at my groundbreaking tomorrow. Do you read me, Chief? - Loud and clear, Mr. Hodgkins. (bike engine revving) (sobbing) (engine revving) (electronics humming) (engine sputtering) (suspenseful synth music) (engine sputtering) (knocking on door) - Jack, the police are on the phone and they... - Chief, are you telling me an entire police force can't find one miserable little kid on a dirt bike? - No, I said, itt's just a matter of time, Mr. Hodgkins. We'll find him. - Now you listen to me, you keystone cop, if that kid disrupts my demolition party tomorrow, I'll use your loan application to line my bird cage. - Flaherty, you moron, have you found him yet? - [Bo] I never thought I'd be sneaking into school. Usually, I'm trying to sneak out. - You know, it wouldn't be so bad, except I don't have anything else. - Believe me, Mike. You've got a lot of friends in this town. We owe you something for what you've done with those kids. We're not gonna let you down. - Sounds like you're talking magic again. - Why not? I've seen you work magic. What about the spirit you put in those kids. You never let them quit. - Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I am quitting, aren't I? What? When the tough, no, no, when the going gets tough, the-- - The tough get going. - It's not over until it's over. I mean, it's not the size of the dog in the fight, it's the size of the fight in the dog. This fight isn't over yet. I gotta believe what I been telling these kids all along. - Now you're talking. What are you gonna do? - What I'm gonna do? I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm going to Hodgkins little shindig here and if I'm going down, I'm going down in style. - Oh, Mike, I'm so proud of you. - Ms. Clavell. - You can call me Maisie. - Maisie. - I don't understand why you had to come all the way over here to use the school's computer, when you've got one at home. - Because there's no way that I could tap into the bank's computers with mine. (computer beeping) Hey, Bo, look! (suspenseful synth music) - You did it! You tapped into the bank's computer. What do we do next? - Okay, now, we have to find the password, so we can get into the file to figure out what makes him so sure Mike's place is the best place to build the new bank. - Sounds easy. - Now, what would Hodgkins use for a password? - How about greedy? (computer beeping) (ominous orchestral music) - Pull over. Any sign of him, Max? - No, not yet, sir. - Find him, Max, or say bye bye to your pretty new bike. - You've got nothing to worry about, sir. Several of my friends are assisting me in my search. - Oh, Max, what a comforting thought, but if the whole police department can't find him, I think it's gonna take a little more than a few of your prepubescent friends. (engines revving) - Well, that sounds like them, now. (heavy guitar music) Mr. Hodgkins, I'd like to introduce you to Big Slime. He hates Jack, too. - [Big Slime] So, you're Hodgkins, huh? - Yes. It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Slime, Big Mr. Slime, Mr. Big Slime. - You know, Max told us about you, Hodgkins. - Oh? - Yeah, you're my kind of guy. - Thank you. - All right, let's nail this kid. - Good hunting. - [Big Slime] Check out that river road. (sighing) - This used to be such a nice town to jack up interest rates in. (computer beeping) (sighing) (light synth music) - [Jack] All right! (computer beeping) (suspenseful synth music) - Got you! Shut up and spread them, you two-wheel bandit. Flaherty, over. - Roger, Flaherty. - Let me speak to the chief. - This is the chief, you idiot. - Hi, chief. Listen, I'm three-niner in a Y, Z, 80. - Dammit Flaherty, will you speak English? - I've got the bike Hodgkins wants. - No foul ups, Flaherty, you hear me? You bring that bike in. - Roger, chief. Oh, hey, no. Hey! (sighing) - It just doesn't make sense, Bo. (keyboard clicking) Bo? Bo? Hey, pee-wee. (gasping) Look, there's no good reason why they had pick Mike's place to put the new bank. In fact, these other sites look a lot better. Why would Hodgkins want to build his bank on the Dog House land? (suspenseful synth music) - Do you realize I have access to all the accounts at Hodgkins Bank right here in front of me? - Hey, Bo, be careful. You didn't do too well in computer class. - I might've gotten a D in computer class, but I know how to break into a bank. - This just doesn't make sense. - Let's check out my account. (computer beeping) Robert Krocaboom. 39 cents? I know I had at least 50. There. I think I'll give ol' Widow White a million bucks. - Bo, would you cool it? - Why not? Every morning, the Widow White goes to the bank, and checks to see if it still has her money. Why don't I give her a surprise? (computer beeping) - It just doesn't make sense. What does Hodgkins got to gain by building on Mike's site? - Well, let's just see how much ol' Hodgkins has got. - Great idea. (phone beeping) - Hodgkins here. - Oh Mr. Hodgkins, you'll be pleased to know we got the kid's bike. It won't be bothering you anymore. - Good work, Chief. I'm on my way to the office now. Oh, Chief, if you're telling me the truth, your little loan is as safe as money in the bank. (laughing) (computer beeping) - Gosh, you'd think the richest man in town would have more money than that? - It's like we both have case flow problems. - [Jack] I wanna know what this other number means. (computer beeping) No wonder he wants Mike out of there. - [Bo] Why? - See this, it's right here. Hodgkins Bank is paying Hodgkins realty for the land. - So? - So that greedy bum Hodgkins has tricked the board of directors at the bank into buying the land from him, and so, that's the reason it's gotta be built in that exact spot. - Well, that really sucks. - It sure does. Let's get a print out. - Chief! Chief. Officer, Chief. Help me! I can't stop this thing. It's resisting arrest. Chief! Come on, stop. Chief! Oh, ow. (motorcycle revving) - Flaherty, you moron! ♪ Bum da da dum bop ♪ ♪ Who's gonna be so filthy rich ♪ ♪ Hodgkins, Hodgkins ♪ ♪ Who cares that he's a son of a ♪ - What's going on here? - Widow White is withdrawing a million dollars from the bank. - She doesn't have a million dollars. - The computer says she does. I've checked it a dozen times. - Widow White, excuse me, Widow White, can we take care of this tomorrow? I have to get to my groundbreaking ceremony this afternoon. - I want my money now, fish face. - Ms. Clavell? - [Ms. Clavell] Yes? - Ms. Clavell, handle this Widow White situation. - No, I won't. - You won't? What do you mean you won't? - I'm tired of doing your dirty work. You do it yourself. - Me? (scoffing) (speaking foreign language) my little underling. That's why I hired you. - I know, and I find you totally insensitive and completely contemptible. - Shh, shh. Be careful, Clavell. You think you're irreplaceable? A trained kangaroo could do your job. - If you're thinking of firing me, it's too late because I already quit. And another thing, don't call me a kangaroo, you pig! (light orchestral music) - Ow. What's happening here? Don't hit me. (suspenseful synth music) - All right now, go and tell Michael what we found, I gotta pay a visit to Hodgkins. - Okay. - Okay. (motorcycles revving) (mellow guitar music) - Good to see you again, kid. I've been looking forward to jumping up and down on your face. (gulping) (lively big band music) - [Cheerleader] Hodgkins! - [Cheerleaders] Hodgkins! - [Cheerleader] Give me a H! - [Cheerleaders] H! - [Cheerleader] Give me an O! (gang laughing) - Bite his nose off, Big Slime, huh? - Yeah, that'd be cool. - No, I think I'm gon' set him on fire. (laughing) (motorcycle revving) - [Gang Member] Ooh. - [Big Slime] Get that kid, get that kid. - [Gang Members] Come on, let's go get him. Come on, move out, come on. - Hodgkins says he wants his dozer rigged so he can push the button on this place himself. What Hodgkins wants, Hodgkins gets. (motorcycles revving) (fast-paced rock music) - Mr. Hodgkins, there's been a little complication with that bike. It seems we don't actually have it in custody. - Chief, I'm on my way to the ceremonies right now. If that kid or bike get within a mile of that Dog House, you'll live out your days as a school crossing guard in Alaska. Do you like blubber? - I want that bike found now.

I've been all night looking for him. - Gosh, I don't know, Ms. Simmons. Gee, I love your new hairstyle. Is that new wave? (lively rock music) (motorcycles revving) - [Big Slime] Whoa! How does he do that? (screaming) (girls cheering) - Get ready for Mike's last stand. I may not win, but I'm going down with my hotdogs flying. - Yee-haw! - Mr. Hodgkins, this one starts the bulldozer and this one stops it. - Yes, thank you, I can read. Now, get off, so I can get this show on the road. Chief! (applauding) Thank you very much. I love you. Ladies and gentlemen, fellow depositors, and faithful members of the Hodgkins team, welcome. Thank you. (crowd applauding) (lively dance music) Now, I know how much you've all been gleefully anticipating this great day, the start of construction on our new bank. (crowd applauding) (booing) Now, it's my pleasure and my honor today to be able to press this little button, and begin destruction of an eye sore that's been a thorn in my side-- - [Kids] Save Mike's Dog House, down with Hodgkins. Save Mike's dog House, down with Hodgkins. Save Mike's Dog House, down with Hodgkins. - Chief, do something. - This is America. They're allowed to protest. That's how we got rid of the British. - [Kids] Down with Hodgkins, save Mike's Dog House. - Ladies and gentlemen, pay no attention to this riff-raff. I hereby declare the start of-- - [Crowd] Save Mike's Dog House, down with Hodgkins. Save Mike's Dog House, down with Hodgkins. - Flaherty, do something. - Okay, what? - Somebody, do something. No, not a pie, you fool. - [Crowd] Down with Hodgkins, save Mike's Dog House. (kids screaming) (upbeat synth music) - You rat, he's not a banker. I'll spank your bottom! I see you, Mike. Mike! Bye bye, Dog House. (suspenseful orchestral music) (bike engine revving) - Come on, come on. - Come on, you can do it, come on! - [Crowd] Go, go, go! - Stop it, stop it. Put it down, put that pie down. You respect your elders. Good boy. - [Jack] You take care of the dozer, I'll handle Hodgkins. Excuse me, Mr. Hodgkins, we better have a talk. - I have nothing to say to you, you juvenile delinquent. - Hey, that's my son you're pushing around. - I warned you at your house, blondie. - Yeah, you were a jerk then, too. - [Jack] All right, Mom. (bike engine revving) (suspenseful orchestral music) (glass shattering) (car crunching) (engine revving) Let's go to the Motion Valley track. - [Mike] Come on, Maisie, let's go. - This is not legal. (tires screeching) - Stop this bike. - [Jack] Not until you listen to what I have to say. - I will listen to nothing. (police siren wailing) (Mr. Hodgkins yelling) - This is Flaherty, Chief. I'm on 11, 13, four, and I'm in pursuit, headed towards route 12, I think. - That's nothing, I got Hodgkins on the kid's motorcycle on route five, I'm gonna cut him off on route 10. (tires screeching) - Oh God, I hate you. - Faster, Mike, faster. - Geez, you're an animal. - Be an animal, Mike, be an animal! - [Mike] Yee-haw! (police siren wailing) - I got him now. Flaherty, why the hell didn't you tell me they closed the cut-off to route 10? - You never asked me, Chief. - Mmm. - Let me off this bike! - [Jack] Not unless you agree to my plan. - I'm a banker, I refuse to count on a little boy. - [Jack] Well, this little boy knows that you're the one making money in the bank's new building. - How did you find that out? - [Jack] From the bank's computers. I've got all the information on a printout. - I won't be blackmailed. (police siren wailing) (car honking) (motorcycles crunching) - Oh, no way. (motorcycles crunching) I'll give you that. Oh, please look out. (motorcycles crunching) I'm getting out of this business. (bells ringing) (light synth music) - All right, all right, you've had your fun. Now, I order you to pull over and debike. - [Jack] First, you have to agree to my plan. - I won't be intimidated by a punk like you. (siren wailing) All right, all right, what do you want? - [Jack] I want you take some of your money and help save Mike's Dog House. - Help save Mike's Dog House? That sucks! (Mr. Hodgkins yelling) - [Announcer] Suddenly, there's a guy packing double on the middle of the race course. Can you freaking see that? I don't know if you can see it. - All right, all right, I'll do it. - [Jack] Just one more thing. - Are you out of your mind? Never. - [Announcer] This bike shouldn't even be out on. Look out, over the jump! - Whoa! Anything, anything, just get me off this bike. (police siren wailing) - [Jack] There you go, Mr. Hodgkins, safe and sound. - Thank God. (Mr. Hodgkins yelling) (laughing) I'm wet! - [Jack] It seem that Mr. Hodgkins has changed his mind about the Dog House. Right, Mr. Hodgkins? - Whatever you say, just get me out of here. That stick is moving. Help! - Hey, you're missing all the fun. You've gotta see this. (engine sputtering) What's the matter? (engine sputtering) This is what we've been working for. (chiming musc) Wait, don't go. (melancholic synth music) - Jack, what's wrong? - It's my bike, Mom, all the magic's gone. - Well, honey, I know this bike is really special to you. - It sure is. But Mom, I was just thinking, if it is gone, then I guess that's because I have my own magic that's working for me now. - Well, your dad used to say that we all have a little bit of magic hidden inside of us. It's just that sometimes, it takes someone special to help us find it. - And that's what my bike did for me, right? - And that's what you do for me. - Oh, thanks, Mom. - You know what the best part of it is? Once you find that magic, no-- - Yeah, I know, nobody else can take it away from me. - That's right. (bike bells ringing) (laughing) - Hey, welcome to the grand opening. Welcome, welcome. Hi, Janet. - Hi, Mike! - Boy, you really did a terrific job arranging for the grand opening. - Aw, thanks. Must be doing something right, I got more new clients than I can handle. - Great, great. (crowd applauding) (engines revving) - Listen, you wanna go inside and see how we used all your ideas? - Oh, I'd love to. - Great. I'll show you. - Bye, guys. Okay. - Oh, Jack, join us later for some dogs and shakes. (laughing) - Hey, Maisie, get ready for our first tour. - Congratulations, both of you. - Thank you. (upbeat big band music) - You better hurry up, Mr. Hodgkins, it's almost time to cut the ribbon. - [Mr. Hodgkins] I'm not coming out. - Mr. Hodgkins, we can't start the ceremonies without you. - [Mr. Hodgkins] I'm not coming out. - Remember our little agreement, Mr. Hodgkins? - Okay, put that away. All right, all right. I'm coming out. (grand synth music) (kids laughing) Happy? - Wow, I sure would love to have a bike like this. - This is a very special bike, you know. - Really? - Well, provided it has the right rider. - Boy. - No, no, no, no. - Mr. Hodgkins, we have a deal. - On behalf of all the kids in town, it is my great pleasure to reopen officially Mike's Dog House. (crowd applauding) And the new Hodgkins Bank. (crowd applauding) (lively orchestral music) (crowd cheering) What a brilliant idea. - [Jack] Thanks, I'm really glad you like it. - Mr. Hodgkins, everything is 100% secure in the new bank, sir, boss. - You are such a weenie. - I'm sorry to be late my first day of telling, Mr. Hodgkins. - Just see that it doesn't happen again, Arthur. Oh, Arthur. (earrings clanging) - You know what? I believe in you. - Come on, Walrus, think this is air conditioned? Open the door. (mysterious synth music) (motorcycle revving) Go away! Stay away from me, stay away! Please, don't hurt me. (crowd cheering) - Jack, your bike. - That's okay, Mom, it's where it's supposed to be.
