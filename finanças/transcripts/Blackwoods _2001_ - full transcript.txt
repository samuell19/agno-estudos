(birds chirping) (insects chittering) (ominous ethereal music) (leaves rustling) (soft eerie music) (cars rushing past) - Here you go, William. - You keep calling me William, little lady, I'm gonna have to haul you in. - Is that really a crime? - Hell, I can pretty much do whatever I want around here. So you better watch it. - Well now, I always thought that you were the one that liked to watch, huh? (chuckles) (kisses head) (pats back) Busy day ahead? - Oh yeah. I'm expecting a rash of parking violations. Proceed with extreme caution on those. Maybe later on, I'll help out the volunteer fire department, rescue a few cats out of some trees. - (chuckles) So in other words? - We're out of my mind, darlin'. - Oh, you poor man. Well honey, let me get you some more coffee, all right? Oh, and Bill, by the way, I'd be very careful what you wish for. God has got himself a very unique sense of humor. (upbeat music playing in background) (phone ringing) (short intense guitar riff) (ominous music) (phone ringing) (door creaks) (water dripping in sink) (sirens wailing on TV) - [Cop On Game] Freeze! (gunfire blazing) (phone ringing) - You okay there, butt nut? - You keep dozing off like that, what are you gonna do when it's time to sleep? You know, I come all the way across town to see you, and all you do is fucking sleep. - Shut up, shut up! - Fuck you! - Hello? - [Dawn] Hey, Matty. - Oh hey baby, where are you? - Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't hear the phone ring. - Sh! - What? - No, no, no, not you. I was talking to numb nuts over here. Where are you? - [Dawn] I'm downstairs. Are you all packed and ready? - As commanded. - [Dawn] Okay, well, meet me downstairs. I'm waiting. And Matty, you just be ready for a wild weekend, okay, soldier? (siren wailing) - Okay. Bye. (phone beeps) - Who was that? The mysterious Dawn? - Yes, it was. - You two have been dating for, what, like three weeks now? When are you gonna introduce her to your friends? - Probably after this weekend. She had some troubles with the last guy she was dating. His friends were assholes or something. - Jesus Christ, man. What the hell you need that thing for? - I'm going in the woods. Who knows? Maybe I'll run into her ex's friends. - Be careful you don't stab yourself in the foot with that thing. (siren wailing in game) Listen, I'm gonna be home pretty much all weekend. So if you're in any trouble out there, you know, need a reason to bail, you can call. - I'm not gonna need an excuse to bail. This is not a blind date. Besides, this is the first time in a long time that- - That what? - That, you know. - Yeah. So what's she like, man? Dawn, what's she like? Big tits? Yeah? - She's beautiful. - Yeah. - She's cool. She's funny. - Big tits? - She calls me on my own bullshit. - Big tits? - And she has big tits, all right? She's great. - I like that. - Jesus Christ. - All right, man. Well, listen. Hey, hey. You gotta be careful about any girl who doesn't wanna meet your friends, okay? This is the kinda girl love you exactly as you are until she gets the first chance to change it. - You know what, man? - What's that? - A change may be exactly what I need. - Is that a fact? - A change from hanging out with assholes like you. (ominous music) - Appreciate it, thank you. Goodbye. (footsteps shuffling) - Hey, baby. - Hey. - Hey. (couple kisses) Who's that guy? - Oh, he's just some guy asking for directions. Told him what he needed to know. - [Matty] Mind if I drive? - I wouldn't have it any other way. (Matty laughing) (upbeat lively music) Are you ready for your wild weekend, huh? - You know it. - [Dawn] Woo! (engine revs) (traffic whooshing past) ♪ There is that place in my mind ♪ ♪ That leads us through (indistinct) ♪ ♪ The sun is grabbing with a squeeze ♪ ♪ With just before ♪ ♪ Of another Dallas trip ♪ - So you gonna tell me where we're going, or do I have to guess? - (laughs) I told you. My family lives in the woods. Deep, deep in the woods. - Well, how deep? - (laughs) Not too deep. Are you worried? - No, I'm not worried. Just... - You know, if this is something you're uncomfortable with, you don't wanna do, we can turn back. It's not too late. - What are you talking about? I'm fine. - Are you sure? You know, it can get very dicey in these backwoods. So you better tell me now. Are you scared, Matty? (laughing) (ominous dark music) - Should I be? - Yes, you should. - I'm not scared of you. - [Dawn] (smooches) All right, it's settled. No going back. (eerie dark music) (loud snapping and whooshing) - This weekend means a lot to me. I'm glad we're doing it. - Yeah, me too. (couple kisses) - My favorite meal would be pasta primavera with lots of cheese, I like cheese, Caesar salad, no anchovies, and for dessert, I would have chocolate mousse with lots of whipped cream. - Ooh, nice. - (laughs) And a steady stream of Merlot. - Very nice. Okay, my turn. All right. - Oh, ooh. - Let's see, it'd have to be a, I like a nice New York steak cooked medium-well, peppercorn sauce with a real nice granella, and, for dessert, cheesecake. - Ah. (Dawn laughs) - You know what, if you like wine so much, how come I'm already on my second and you haven't even had a sip? - Well, is this how Matt Sullivan beds his women, getting them drunk? Scandalous. I'm gonna have to watch myself with you. - That's right. - Okay, next. Most embarrassing moment. - I hate that one. (Dawn chuckles) Most embarrassing moment. When I was about 15, I got in trouble with some kids at school, some older kids. And in the popular style of most bullies, my daily torture was part of their daily routine. - Poor baby. - Mm-hmm. So one day I come home with a black eye and a broken bicycle. (sighs) Next day, my mother shows up at school, and she grabs each of these kids out of their homerooms and in front everybody and just, you know, she just goes off on 'em, reads em the riot act. It was just terrible. - Oh! No. - Oh yeah. So the beatings got worse for a while after that, of course, (laughs) but they learned their lesson. - Which was? - Don't bruise Matt Sullivan's face. I learned to keep my mouth shut. - My brave little man. - The person who didn't learn the lesson was my mother. She was kind of leaning towards the side of being overprotective, you know? She never really let me fight my own battles, you know? (fast-paced intense music) But this is a bad subject. - Yeah. Okay. - Yeah, so let's change it. Next one, next one. - All right. Favorite Sinatra song. - Oh, cutting right to the important issues. "My Way," definitely. - Man, I knew you were gonna say that. - Hmm, because you think you're a very clever boy. - There you go. (dark ominous music) - Thank you. You see that? - What? The waitress. - Who, Beth? - You know her? - I know how to read. - Her name tag says Beth. What's (laughs) the matter? - Well, she was staring at me, you know? She came over, she dropped off the plates, and then she just kinda, I don't know, I think she was checking me out. - That bitch. I'm gonna get a manager. I think you're a little paranoid or something. I don't know what. (dark intense music) (glass shatters) - All right. - [Dawn] Maybe you could see mine now, hmm? - It'd be nice. - (laughs) Woo! - What about favorite sexual position? - (laughs) Jesus, Matty, the sun's not even down yet. Why don't you wait a little bit, find out for yourself? - You didn't finish your drink. (dark ominous music) (sighs) (glass clinks) Thanks very much. (upbeat rock music) ♪ Never had a chance to meet ya ♪ ♪ Never had a chance to cry ♪ - [Matt] So should I be nervous about meeting your parents? - Why, what did you do? - Oh, nothing. I mean, you know, it's the first time meeting your parents. I don't wanna make a complete ass out of myself. - Well, it's too late for that, huh? (laughs) Don't worry about it. They're harmless. Honestly, they're kind of sad, really. They just had a rough time the last couple of years, so they're not quite the carefree clan they used to be. I mean, my brother and my father, I mean, they all used to go hunting for deer all the time, and I don't even think they do that anymore. - You know, you never told me that you had any brothers. - Yeah! I have three. I have two older. Let's see, that is Jack, that one is Johnny, and I got this, that's Billy; he's younger. They all live at the ranch with my parents. - [Matt] So your brothers still live with your parents? - Yeah, so? - Jesus. - What, you never read "Death of a Salesman"? Besides, you're in the blackwoods now, honey. That's a far cry from the big city. - The blackwoods? - Mm-hmm, the blackwoods. - They call it woods around here because at night it gets so dark, you can't see anything. So the backwoods, the blackwoods. - I get it. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. (laughs) - So what happened? - Oh, I think it was just when he pushed me down the stairs- - No, no, with your family.

I'm just with my girlfriend. We're visiting her parents. They live in the area. - Is that a fact? - Yes, sir. We just ate at the Silverstone a few miles back. - I know the Silverstone. - Well, is there something I can help you with, sir? - Couldn't help but notice you were going a few miles over the limit. It may be a small town. We place a rather high value on human life. Nothing serious. Just thought I'd yank you over, see what's what anyway. - [Matt] Did you notice? - You know, do I know you? You look a bit familiar. - No, no, I don't think so. - [Sally] Bill, you there? Bill. - Excuse me. Yeah, Sally I'm here. What is it? - [Sally] Yeah, Sid says there's a B&E in progress at the high school. - Well, old Sid wouldn't know shit if he stuck his thumb up his own ass and it came out brown.

(laughs) - Why'd you jump back there? - Because I didn't want the sheriff to see me. - Why? - Oh my God. Bill Harding is the most long-winded man I have ever known in my life. If he would've recognized me, he would've chatted us up for like 20 minutes, you know? Like, "How are you doing, Dawn" and "Where are you going, Dawn" and "How come no one ever sees you anymore, Dawn," and we would've been like, "Ah!" - He seemed like a nice enough guy. - (laughs) Well, throw us way off schedule. - You got a train to catch? - (laughs) No, but I do have a surprise for you.

Yeah, actually, I do. - 'Cause if you want, I can put you in a room where the TV plays porno all the time. Day in, day out, just people fucking. Cost a little extra though. But if that's your thing, I mean... - Actually I'm all covered on the porno, friend. But a room I still need. - You got a lady with you? - Yeah. - 'Cause if you want, I can put you in a room where the TV plays porno all the time.

All right. All right, I see you're in a hurry. I'll, let's see, how about room five? - Great. - I think it's got clean sheets. That'll be $50. - There you go. - All right. - And can I get an extra key? - Oh, well, your lady friend's gotta come in and get it.

In fact, there's the trail that runs right past my parents' house right outside of the hotel. - Well, what time are they expecting us? - Soon, but we have time. There's a few more state laws that I would like to test before we (muffled speaking). - Oh, that sounds good to me, but, you know what? I think you took it out of me.

Now let's go, come on! - Whoa, whoa! - Come on, man! What's wrong with you? - Hold it just a second! Now you're dragging me towards the room where you say there's a guy with an ax, and you call me an idiot? - Come on. (men breathing heavily) (yells loudly) - Sir, there's no one in here. Ah, shit. What'd you do to my fucking door and the lamp? You're gonna pay for this stuff. We're not running that kind of place here. You just can't break stuff without consequences. - Listen to me. I was sitting right here. I heard noises out there. I looked through that peephole, and I saw a very large man standing there with the very large ax. Now you with me? - Now, why would someone wanna be doing that? - I'll tell you why he would be doing something like that, so he could chop me into little fucking pieces. - Now why would someone wanna kill you in the first place? What are ya, enemies of the conspiracy? You can tell me. I know all about that stuff. - I don't know what you're talking about, man. All I know when somebody came in here with an ax, and he tried to fucking kill me. - All I know is some guy, you, come in here and rip the fucking door off the hinge, and you're telling me about some guy dressed in black, ninja-in' it up, but all I'm hearing is tomorrow morning, my boss chewing me a new asshole 'cause of this door. - I never said he was dressed in black. - You didn't? - No, I didn't. - Well, I must've assumed it, then. It's night, and you got a guy pulling a B&E, and. Don't look at me like that. Well, what about you? Where's this lady friend of yours? I don't see no chick shit here. - That's none of your business, man. You know what? Get the hell outta here. - Hey! Listen. You're gonna pay for the fucking door and the lamp.

(door creaks open) Think you better come over my office, have a little talk, partner. - Okay. (door shuts) (footsteps thudding) - [Matt] Thanks a lot, pal. - Anytime, loser. - Hey. That's enough of that talk, Greg. - [Matt] Freak! - Vandal! - Ain't helping things, Greg. (doors shut) (engine purrs) (slow dramatic music) (car humming) Well, I guess when I asked you to go easy on that heavy foot, I should've had you go light on private property, huh? (car whooshes past) Are you feeling all right? - Aside from the part where the guy tried to kill me, I guess I feel fucking fantastic. - Now you watch that talk, Mr. Sullivan. I won't listen to it, you understand? - Well, I'm upset. I'm sure you understand. - Absolutely. Okay. Let's go over this one more time for the report. - Fine. Now you say you were out here in the blackwoods to visit your girlfriend's family, the Banks, whom you've never met and I've never heard of. - And you're sure you've never heard of Dawn Banks? - It's a small town. I'm absolutely positive. And then you and your girlfriend decided to stop and motel for a little sex, after which your girlfriend disappears. And then twice, not once, but twice, an attempt is made on your life by a man dressed in black. - Did I say that he was dressed in black? (dark ominous music) - Yeah, you got it right here. "Guy was dressed all in black." - Okay. - So what have we got left? One broken motel room closet door, one missing girlfriend, and absolutely no evidence that any of this took place at all. - It happened, sir. - So you say. Well, what exactly would you like me to do about this nonsense? - What I'd like you to do about all this nonsense? I'll tell you what I'd like you to do. I'd like you to go out there and try and find Dawn, who I'm really worried about, 'cause I don't know where the hell she is, and I'd like you to try and find that fucker! - Now don't make me use my nightstick. No, no, no, I'd like you to use your nightstick! I'd like you to use it on the fucker who came into my room and tried to fuck me up permanent! Now I'm sorry, man, but that is exactly what happened! - Try to see this from my point of view, Mr. Sullivan. I deal in things I can see, not in things that can't see. And as I pointed out, you are seriously lacking in the evidence department. So these are your options, and there are no others. You can A, spend the night in my jail cell for disorderly conduct, which I don't recommend, or B, you can make good for the damage to the motel room closet door, and get in your car and keep going until you're nothing but a funny story. Now that option I strongly recommend. - Just let me stay it a little bit longer, okay? Let me just go over this one more time with you. - I think our time here is finished, Mr. Sullivan. - Are you honestly telling me that I'm on my own here? - Mr. Sullivan, we are all on our own in this world, and I'm not gonna spend my night chasing after your ghost.

You go and get your pa a beer from the fridge. - Yes, sir. - Yeah, Dawn, I'll take one too, huh? A cold boy. - Not your fucking maid, Johnny.

You had a car accident, a very serious car accident. (Matt coughs) Am I all right? - Well, you're very lucky. You sustained a very serious head injury, which left you unconscious for a few hours, but your vital signs are good. I see no real concern for complications. - What happened? - Your car went off the road and hit a tree. - Jesus. (chuckles hesitantly) Is the tree all right? (coughs) - I would refrain from cracking myself up for awhile. And the tree is fine. The girl you ran over before you hit the tree, however, is not. (unsettling dramatic music) She's dead. - I killed someone? - [Doctor] Yes, you actually did that. It was a very bad accident. As I said before, Mr. Sullivan, you're very lucky. (eerie tense music) (water dripping) (eerie giggling in background) - [Matt] What are you doing? - Hey, Matty. Didn't know you were conscious already. (grunts) As for what I'm doing, I think that's pretty obvious. I'm decreasing the chances of your escape. - Why? - You would do the same. - Why are you doing this? - (chuckles) You don't know? That's so sad. (Matt grunts) Have a look around you, Matty. Came out here to meet my family, and meet them you shall. Your trial is about to begin. - [Matt] Trial for what? - You know. You fucking know! And if you don't know, you will. He's all set! You just sit back and relax. Have fun, Matty. It's what you do best. (footsteps thudding) - [Man With Glasses] Nice to you again, Matt. (objects clattering) - Be seated. Your name Matthew Sullivan? - Yes. - Do you live with 1245 Yuliet Street? - Yes. - Have you ever been arrested for a crime, Mr. Sullivan? - What? (punch thuds loudly) (Matt screams) - Now there's no fair warning in this room, Mr. Sullivan. You don't answer a question with a straight answer, things are gonna happen to you. Now, have you ever been arrested for a crime? - Yes. - What was the nature of those crimes? - I don't know. What's the point of me... - All right, all right. When I was eight, I was arrested for shoplifting. I took one of those ice cream push-up pops from the neighborhood store. When I was 16, I got arrested for a little grass down by the town water tower. Cops tried to put a scare in me, but the charges were eventually dropped. And I don't know if you wanna count this, but I was arrested for unpaid speeding tickets when I was 21, and I paid a big fine for that. And that's about it. - That's it? You sure? (slow dramatic music) You think about it. (sniffles) That's what I thought. Matthew Sullivan, you are on trial for the murder of Molly Franklin, my youngest daughter. I'm not- - You hit her with your fucking car! - Jack, you get your ass in that seat, and don't you get out of that seat until I goddamn tell ya! (distorted unsettling music) (radio playing) (tires screeching) - Oh my God. That? - Yes, Mr. Sullivan, that. - Oh my God. Oh my God. - [Jim] Good thing I'm not afraid of the dark. ♪ Everything has happened for a reason ♪ ♪ Everything has happened for a reason ♪ (sighs) - Now I'm gonna explain how this works. We're gonna have some people from this room come up and sit in this barrel next to me here. We're gonna call them figurers. Now they're gonna do some figuring, and you can ask them a question anytime you want. And you're gonna haul your ass up here and tell us your side of the incident. You're gonna get a fair trial, Mr. Sullivan, but I do have the final say in how the night ends. This is the Franklin ranch here, and I rule the roost. No one to help you now. - Oh, God, Matthew. I'll call Uncle Frank. He'll know what to do. (unsettling tense music) (footsteps shuffling) - Molly was the sweetest girl ever. Never had a bad thing to say. I remember weekend I was sick, the weekend Ma and Pa went to Graceland to see the King's belongings. Molly, she's only nine at the time, she took care of me and got me better, even though I was supposed to be watching her. Now, thanks to that man right there, God is watching her in his kingdom. - You got any questions for this figurer? - What do you want me to argue, that Molly was a sweet girl? - I'll take that as a no. Well, we should move right along here, unless you got anything else to say, John. (footsteps shuffling) - Can't wait to get you up here. It ain't a party until something breaks. (papers shuffling) - Was a Thursday night just before dusk, and Ma and Pa were in town, and it was starting to get dark out. And I thought there might be a sixer that I could get started on, but the cupboard was bare. So I asked Moll if she wouldn't mind going down to the grocery to get me some beers. I guess she didn't wanna leave. I asked her again and again, and finally she said, "All right." I guess she just wanted me to shut the fuck up. Can I cuss down here, Pa? - Well, I think in keeping with a proper environment of a courtroom, we should keep our cussing down to a bare minimum. - All right, Pa. So anyway, Molly headed out for the store, and she's gone a couple hours. (soft dramatic music) It started to snow, and then she was gone a couple more hours, and I was just lying there on the couch, getting real pissed and cussing her and throwing things 'cause the thought that something might have happened to Moll never crossed my mind, not around these parts. That somebody might've ran over her with his car before crashing into a tree never entered into it! My baby sister lying there in the road, her blood spilling down the street. I just wanted my beers. - Have you got any questions for this figurer, Mr. Sullivan? - Actually, I do. Do you mind if I stand up? - I'm thinking not. - All right, Jack. You said that it was your idea for Molly to go on the beer run, and you also just referred to Molly's death as an accident. - I never said the word accident. You say the word accident, Pa? - I said incident. I didn't say accident. - Okay, all right. In that case, Jack, do you feel to blame for the incident? - You trying to blame this on me, you little shit? - No, Jack. - You didn't take responsibility for it then, and you're not taking it now! Listen- - You were driving drunk! You were driving goddamn drunk. That's why Molly's dead! (dramatic suspenseful music) - [Pa] Take it easy. - Get the outta here. I thought that... (phone ringing) This is your job. This is your job. This is your job. Hello, motel? - Yeah, Greg, Sheriff Harding. You busy? - Oh, hey, sheriff. I'm just catching up on my reading a little bit. What can I do for ya? - You had any more problems with our little visitor tonight? - Ah, no. It's been quiet since you left. His car's been gone for awhile. - You know, I've got his face in my head, and I just can't place it yet. Does he look familiar to you? - Yeah, he looks like that fellow that trashed my motel room. - Now listen, Greg. I want you to go over to Sullivan's room and see if he's there. - Sheriff, his car's gone. I don't think he's there. - Greg, just go over and do it and call me back, okay? - All right, sheriff. (receiver slams down) (rock music playing on radio) - [Jim ] Come on, Matty, where are ya? (car whooshing past) (slow dramatic music) - If Molly caught cancer or had been burned up in a fire, I could grieve and go on. God made it that way. But since she died in the hands of another, I can't get none of that, (snaps fingers) what do you call it? - Satisfaction. - Nah, that ain't it. - Closure, Ma? - Thank you, Billy. Closure. I can't get none of that until the person responsible pays for what he's done. - And is that person in this room tonight? - He's sitting right there. You took a life, Mr. Sullivan. You ain't God, and you'll know what I'm talking about when you see him. (door creaks closed) (dog barking in distance) (bugs chittering) - Mr. Sullivan? Mr. Sullivan, you in there? Mr. Sullivan? (door creaks open) (door closes) - Eh, fucking vandal's gone. I knew it. (TV static hissing) (porn music playing on TV) (woman moaning and screaming) (phone rotary whirring and clicking) - [Woman] Oh, yeah! Oh, God. Oh, yeah! - [Bill] Sheriff Harding. - This is Greg at the Yellow Rose Motel. - [Bill] I know where you are, Greg. Any sign of him? - No, no, just like I thought. - [Bill] His stuff still there? - Yep. - [Bill] All right. Stick around just in case. Hey Greg, what's them voices I hear? - Oh, nothing, sheriff. Bye. (woman screaming on TV) Woo, doggy! - Why are you doing this, huh? Aren't you gonna go up there and say anything? - Can't. - Why not? - 'Cause it's your turn. Pa? (toothpick clicks) - [Matt] What am I supposed to do? - You're supposed to tell the truth. - All right. Well, I was coming back from a weekend golf tournament with a girlfriend of mine, and we had lunch. And afterwards, I wasn't quite ready to go home, so I went for a drive. - Matthew! Jesus, Matt, how many times are we gonna go through this? Don't be an idiot! Come on! What are you, just gonna leave me out here? (door slams) Matthew, this isn't funny. I have no way to get home. Just let me drive! (engine purring) Asshole! - I went through the blackwoods. (car whooshes past) And I don't think I really was caring exactly where I was going. Unbelievable, man. And there was a song on the radio that I didn't like, and I went down to hit the button on the radio, and it was stuck. The button on radio was stuck, and that's, and it wouldn't move, and that's where my attention was right there, and that's when I lost control of the car. (distorted unsettling music) (tires screeching) (body cracks against car) Now the fact that I play such an such an instrumental role in the death of your daughter is awful, but it was an accident. It was that it was an incident. It was an accidental incident that I wished that I didn't have to remember. That's all I have to say about it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Of course you're sorry. You're being held in the basement of the family whose daughter that you murdered. It's easy to be sorry under those conditions, huh? (slow dramatic music) - Well, I guess you're right. - So the radio knob was stuck? That's why you lost control of your car? - Yeah, I just lost control. - When you were dining at this restaurant before the crash, which I understand that you're very sorry about, how many drinks did you have? - You know what? If you like wine so much, how come I'm already on my second, and you haven't even had a sip? - How many drinks did you have? - I had a glass, glass of wine, glass and a half of wine. I didn't mean to- - Oh, wow. Just 'cause you didn't mean kill Molly doesn't make her any less dead, now does it? How many drinks did you have? (pleasant music playing in background) (sighs) - Well, I told you, I had a glass, glass and a half of wine. It was long time ago. - Oh yeah, yeah. Five years is more than enough time to forget about a young girl's death, huh? I'm sure that you just blocked everything out, but, see, that's why we're here, right boys? Help you remember? So are you sure that you only had two drinks, Matt? - I think that's all I had to drink. - That's funny 'cause the waitress at the restaurant, she said that you were so drunk, you could barely get in your car. So maybe we should stop making excuses about your fucking radio knob, hmm? - I wasn't trying... (car zooms past) (song with muffled vocals plays on radio) (engine revving) (tires screeching) (car smashes sign) - You were drunk. Why don't you just admit it? (panting) You were drunk, weren't you? (Dawn screams) (suspenseful music) Why won't you just admit it! Admit it! Why don't you just admit it! Admit it! (punch lands) (Matt groaning loudly) - I was gonna spend some time to think about my verdict, but I don't think that's gonna be necessary. Matthew Sullivan, you have been found guilty of the murder of Molly Franklin. (dramatic music) I do believe there's a certain amount of remorse in you. I'm gonna call it two minutes' worth remorse, and I'll explain why. Your sentence is almost certain death. We're gonna take you upstairs, we're gonna open the front door, then you're gonna run out into the blackwoods. And after two minutes, Jack and John here, they're gonna come after you. That's gonna be the end of you, Mr. Sullivan. Court adjourned. - You can't just do that to me. You can't just take me in the woods and treat me like an animal! You can't do that to me! You can't! - [Jack] Move it, boy! Get up here, come on! - Can't do that to me! - [Jack] Hurry up, hurry up! Get going! Get up there! (upbeat music playing on radio) - Hey, Bill. Oh sweetie, you look tired. Can I get you something to eat? - No, coffee's fine, Beth. But, you know, I wanted to ask you about a man who was in here yesterday named Matthew Sullivan, kind of tall, lean, wearing a brown leather jacket, blue jeans. Might've acted kind of strange. You remember him? - Oh yeah, I remember him. (chuckles) How could I forget? So odd. Have you ever seen something so strange that you were at a loss for words, that all you could do is just tell yourself to keep on smiling? - Yeah, tonight, actually. So what happened? (dramatic music) (men yelling) (Matt groaning loudly) (body thudding down steps) (family chuckling) (gun cocks) - Hey Matty. Now it's my turn. (suspenseful music) (Matt cries out) I suggest you get moving, Mr. Sullivan. My boys haven't been hunting for a couple of moons now, and they're itching to kill something. They you can smell your blood. (Matt cries out) You got a minute 40. Then we coming to getcha! - [Jack] You better run! - [Pa] Go, boy! (suspenseful music) Run, boy! (men yelling simultaneously) - Woo! - Run, boy! (engine purrs) (soft dramatic music) (door closes) (footsteps crunching on asphalt) - Matt? Matt! (suspenseful music) - [Pa] Go get 'em, boys! Times up, Mr. Sullivan! We're coming to get you! (man howls) (other man laughs) - [Man] Go over there! (leaves rustling) - Run, boy! (flare gun blasts) Woo hoo! Run, boy! Run! (dramatic tense music) It's killing time! (suspenseful music) (Jack whooping) Yeah! Where is he? Where is he? Yeah, boy! - Don't even give me that look, Sarah. I've seen the look. I know the look. I've memorized that look. - Oh really now? Well, then go ahead, Rich Little. Show me the look. - (sighs loudly) Oh my God. He's having another drink. - That look? I do that? - Yes. Yes you do. - Huh. Well, what possible reason would I have to give you look like that? Let me think. (gasps) What if my boyfriend had had four glasses of wine and just ordered a fifth? And what if we'd only brought the one car, and he refused to let me drive his precious baby, even though he's way too drunk to get behind the wheel? Yeah, then I guess that look might be in order. - I'm a big boy, Sarah. - Which is why you can even carry on a conversation with me at all. But one more, Matthew, and you're gonna be blubbering like a teenage girl at "Titanic." - (laughs) It was funny. That was funny. - Yeah, well, funny or not, it doesn't change the fact that I'm wishing like hell I drove tonight. Nothing on Earth is gonna make me get into a car with you driving. - I'm a big boy, Sarah. I'm always in control. - Maybe. Still not driving with you. - Suit yourself. (pleasant music in background) (muffled chatter) - How am I supposed to get home, Matthew? We're not exactly close to the city out here. - Woo hoo! Oh my God. You know what? I really don't care because if you don't feel safe with me, then guess what? You're on your own. (suspenseful music) (men laughing) - [Jack] Yeah! (man whooping) We're gonna get you, boy! You better run! - (laughs) We're coming, boy! - You better run! (laughs) There he is! Get him! (whoops) Yeah! Hey, boy! (muffled speaking) We're coming! We're gonna getcha! - [Jack] Get you, boy! - All right, I go this way, you go that way. - [John] Yeah. Sullivan! (leaves rustling) (panting) Hey, boy! (men panting) Here, boy! Come on out! Come on out, Sullivan! We're gonna play! Son of a bitch! Sullivan! Sullivan! Sullivan! You son of a bitch. Where you at, Sullivan? I'm gonna finish what my baby brother couldn't. (Matt yells) (men grunting) (gun blasts) (gun thudding against head) (dramatic tense music) (arrow whizzes and thuds into tree) - Turn around! Get rid of the gun. If it's possible to be any more dead than you are right now, then I don't right fucking know about it! If I shoot you real close like this, you'll be kicking for awhile, and boy, that is something I wanna see! (suspenseful music) (Jack groaning loudly) (body thuds) (moaning) (yells aloud) (tense music) (groaning) (phone ringing) - [Mom] Hello? - Mom. - Matt, what's wrong? - I've been in an accident. - [Mom] What? - [Matt] I think I hit somebody, Mom. - What happened? Are you okay? Did you call an ambulance? - Yeah. Mom, so much blood. - Where are you? Oh God, please don't tell me you're drunk right now. - (moans) I need help, Mom. (grunts) - Oh God, Matthew. I'll call Uncle Frank. He'll know what to do. (phone clicks) (slow dramatic music) (footsteps rustling) (animal calls in the distance) (whoosh) - You know, it's been almost three years since the incident. - Hmm, usually, you refer to that night as the accident. (tense brooding music) (pen clicks) - It's funny how you can tell yourself a story and then convince yourself that it didn't happen that way, like when you tell an old story over and over again, and the more and more you tell it, the more and more changes and you forget what the real story was, and then your reality changes. - I'm wondering which reality you're talking about. Which story? - When I woke up in that hospital and they told me that I had killed a young girl, my first thought was, "My God. My life is over with." - It wasn't, "Hey man, somebody is dead because of you." - Oh, it's not uncommon. Self preservation is the foremost human instinct. - Yeah, but my preservation is taken care of by my mother and my Uncle Frank. - [Doctor] How? - Oh, he's a big shot district prosecutor, you know, takes care of...(sighs) - What are you telling me, Matt? What's going on here? What are you telling me? (soft dramatic music) - Matt! What is going on here? I said what the hell is going on, man? Matt? (Matt sobbing) Hey, hey. What's going on, buddy? Hey. - What are you doing here, Jim? How did you find me here? - You called me, Matt. Remember, you said I was the only one you could trust. - I can't trust you, man. You're just like everybody else, watching me. You watching me, Jim. - Buddy, but you said that they all knew something, right? And I find you like this. What do they all know, Matty? - Someone's watching me. - Okay, you can give me the knife now, Matty, okay? Give me the knife. Give me the knife. - Self preservation is the foremost human instinct. (dramatic music) (eagle screeches in distance) (bugs chittering) (birds calling) (woodpecker knocking) - [Bill] Good God in heaven. (tense suspenseful music) (Matt yells out) (suspenseful music) (men grunting) (punches and kicks land) - Sullivan! Sullivan! Sullivan, stop running! Stop running! Stop running! It'll work out better if you stop! There's no way out of here! - You know, I come all the way across town to see you, and all you do is fucking sleep. - Shut up, shut up. - Fuck you! - Hello. (dial tone buzzing) Oh, hey baby. Why are you? - Ooh, sorry, I didn't hear the phone ring. - Shh! No, no, no, not you. I was talking to numb nuts over here. - Hey, baby. (laughs) (soft somber piano music) (kisses air) Who's that guy? Mind if I drive? - [Bill] Give yourself up! - Oh, yeah, I remember. How could you forget? So odd. - Ah ha! - Have you ever seen something so strange that you were at a loss for words? - [Matt] All right, my turn. - That all you could do is just tell yourself to keep on smiling. - Yeah, tonight actually. So what happened? - Here you go. (plates gently clinking) (pleasant music on radio) - Hi. Did you see that? - It'll be better if you stop! Sullivan! - [Matt] If you like wine so much, how come I'm already on my second, and you haven't even had a sip? - Well, that's bullshit. (porno playing in background) (woman moaning) - [Woman] Oh, yeah! Yeah! - That's not. - [Bill] There's no way out! (footsteps thudding) (leaves rustling) (grunting) Stop or I'll shoot! Stop running! - It's funny how you can tell yourself a story and then convince yourself that it didn't happen that way. You tell yourself the same lie, and after a while, you start to believe it. Like when you tell an old story over and over again, and the more and more you tell it, the more and more changes and you forget what the real story was. (Matt screams out) (suspenseful music) And then your reality changes. (grunts) (bear trap snaps) - [Doctor] I'm wondering which reality you're talking about. - [Matt] When I woke up in the hospital and they told me that I had killed a young girl, my first thought was, "My God. My life is over with." - [Doctor] Self preservation is the foremost human instinct. - [Matt] Yeah, but my preservation is taken care of by my mother and my Uncle Frank.

Guess it's pretty tough to lose your only daughter. When people do wrong, they know it. Whether or not they accept it is another story. You get to believe in your own lies you tell 'em long enough. You can't escape your past, no matter how hard you try. Things have a way of coming back. Some folks might call it haunting. I imagine retelling this story in years to come, I'll gloss over my part in it, relieve my conscience from my guilt, my nonchalance. The truth always comes back, it always does.
