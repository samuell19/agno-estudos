Come on and dance with me Dance, dance with me Come on and dance with me Dance, dance with me Everybody’s got something to do, Everybody but you. Hey! You praying for me, sir? I did. What can I do for you, Mr. Satan? What time is it, conductor? Midnight, sir. The train crashes and thorn. Right on schedule. The night porter will see to everything. Mr. satan. Exactly. You really enjoy seeing people suffer. - You created man to suffer. - Wrong I made him to enjoy. Then why did you given the right to choose? I will not force man to be good. It can either walk in my steps or yours. My way is much more fun. I offer adultery, alcohol, tobacco, cocaine. Greed, rape, murder, war. All the fun things. That's why you're losing so many. All you can offer is a short ride on earth. My proom goes on forever. They don't believe forever. All they want is now. You once sat at my right side in heaven. Did you ever dream of coming back. - Would you let me? - Could you change? Nah. I could more be good than you can be bad. Let's take up the first case. Harry you're driving too fast. Harry! This is the case of Harry Billings, a hard working salesman during the day. At night a man who enjoys cars women and booze. Sometimes a little too much. It is his wedding night, but his wife lies dead. At the bottom of the river and Harry lies in a sanitarium ward. About to enter a new life... of terror. I'm Dr. Fargo, a psychiatrist. Why am I strapped down? Dinner will be served soon. - Hey, wait a second... - I'll see you tomorrow, Harry. Hey, wait a second, wait a second, Don't leave me like this. And what the hell kind of a place is this? When you awake, I'll return. We'll have a nice long chat. - How's the new arrival? - Belligerent. He's a very handsome man. Now did you feel good? One more try and We'll finish. Maybe have a phone here, they'll let us use. Sorry to bother you this time of night. We're lost. You have a phone we could use? Hey, there's pay phones on the highway. We stupidly didn't bring any change. Okay, come on. Hello, is this the Bayside Motel? This is Mrs. Howard Green. Uh, we have a reservation tonight but we're lost and... Where are we? Just tell us what highway you're on and we'll find it. We'll be there as soon as we can, okay. Thank you. Bye-bye. Howard? Howard? Harry, can you hear me? I can hear you. That injection puts you under hypnosis. You must do exactly what I tell you. - Do you understand? - I understand. A pill dropped into liquid, when swallowed a person remains unconscious for hours. This was only one of many methods Dr. Brewer instructed Harry Billings to use. - Another? - Please. Hey, you're a fast drinker. Hey, slick. - Drinks are on me. - Well, thank you my good man. To your health, sir. To the beautiful blondes. No! Oh, no! I'm Dr. Brewer, can I help you? Do you have a patient named Verna Davis? Verna Davis? No I don't think so. Well, uh, she was last seen driving with a man in one of your cars. You must be mistaken. Oh, my nephew, you he works for the vehicle department and he uh he gave me this report. And you see this, uh, this place is the registered owner of this car. In that case we'd better check the records. Verna. Verna? - Verna! - Shh! She's, uh, there's nobody at home up there you know. No offense. Do you mind if I sit here, miss? No! It's all right Harry, I'm here. I'm only trying to cure you. I'll protect you. No more pain, no more hurt. No dreams, only healing in my arms. Susan would want you to feel again, feel me. Only me. Alive. Warm. Waiting. Bodies for money. Bodies for money. The victims were kidnapped tortured and finally murdered. And then the evil doctors would sell the body parts to medical schools all around the world. To the future. Hello? Hello Dory. No, no, no, you're what is that? I have Dr. Fargo with me right now. I personally can't wait to hear the old man's wishes. She's going to hand pick the next back for him. He said the old man will be pleased. I'll see you, bye bye. Harry, hand me that large saw over there. I'm going to lobotomize you, doctor Brewer, just like you've done to others. Now, we have this whole place to ourselves. Just you and me, Harry. And we don't have to go out of business. You bring on the bacon and I'll fry it. you're not pleased. I want to return to a regular life. Where do I fit into your regular life? Emergency! Emergency! Harry Billings is missing. Emergency! Harry? Harry I know you're in here. Harry you'd better show yourself. If you don't come out, Harry, I'll have to send for Otto. You picked the poor time to play games. We have to deliver the girls at the airport tonight. No one's leaving here for that airport tonight. - Harry, come here. - Yesterday's shot wore off. I'm not under your influence anymore. - I'm going to free the girls. - No! Everything is ours now. I don't want anything to do with you anymore. Let's go. I know I forgot something. - What you forget? - I'm doing surgery. This is my surgery. There's only one way to find out. I'm going to have to open her up. - Which one? - I don't know... what I use, that. Here's the thin one. Oh, wasn't that lovely? You see, my lord? There is no evil survival which man will plunge himself into. Harry Billings was not a free agent. And he did try to redeem himself. I can't see Harry in heaven. - He does not belong in hell. - Gentlemen. How about 100 years in purgatory? But the two doctors and Otto are mine. Make sure they have a one-way ticket. What about the track band in the car up ahead? What about them? Why, the musicians, I usually get most of them anyway. Not all of them. But they don't love you. They never even think of you. Think of them. I've never heard one of them pray. That's because you don't listen to their music. You call that music what they're playing? - Some of it is quite touching. - It never touches me. You have no tears. You don't know how to cry. I can laugh, that's better than tears. I can love and cry at the same time. That is what I listen for in their music. Sister’s on the telephone, Gossipin’ again. Junior’s at the arcade, Smokin’ with his friends. Everybody’s got something to do, Everybody but you. Come on and dance with me, dance with me Come on and dance with me, dance with me Everybody’s got something to do, Everybody but you. Mr. Night porter when do we get to Las Vegas? One hour, if there's no delay. But, what could delay us? One hour to the train crash. You really look forward to. It's the only pleasure you left me with when you kicked me out of heaven. And now the case of Gretta Connors. Gretta Connors. I really want her. Popcorn, mister? Popcorn? Popcorn, mister? Little girl, where have you been all my life? A dollar a bag. You're gonna buy? Or crap out. I'll buy. And buy. And buy. Buy. Shall we? why the hell not? This is a strange love story, the case of Gretta Connors. A young musician from a small town. To support her piano playing she worked in a carnival. She came to the big city to find success and love. Instead, she found George Youngmeyer. and as so often happens to the young. They're so desperate. They will believe in anything or anyone. Gretta gave herself completely to Youngmeyer. He promised to make her famous, but used greta for his own purposes. She wanted to be a movie star, so he made her a star. This is Glenn Marshall, college graduate, enrolled in medical school. He stopped by his fraternity house for a beer one day. A day that would change his life. He saw Gretta in one of Youngmeyer's movies. It was love at first sight. Glenn had to find her. Glenn's obsession finally brought him to George Youngmeyer's Manhattan Club, where greta was playing. - Here's you mag. - Thanks. Where'd we get the piano? - The gift. - From who? - Some guy. - Doesn't have a name? You don't know him, so the name wouldn't mean anything. I called him and told him that I needed one so he sent one over. Some guys are like that, you know? - How about going out for dinner? - There's plenty to eat right here. - I don't want to go anywhere. - I just don't want you getting bored. You just keep getting it up. Youngmeyer could not forgive Gretta. No one ever walked out on him. He hated Glenn and still held a power over Gretta. George Youngmeyer was going to have revenge against the two lovers in his own horrible way. And so our story takes its strange twist. We go now to the death club, an evil society run by Youngmeyer and his partner, Contessa. Mr. Marshall, do you know about our club? You tell him, Contessa. Our society is composed of members all of whom have had a close encounter with death. Have you ever had such an experience, Mr. Marshall? - As a child I almost drowned. - Childhood experiences don't count. - You don't have to join our club. - Are you interested Mr. Marshall? - I don't know. - Come off it. - Spell it out for us, Contessa. - From time to time. One of us thinks of a novel way to expose us to death. - You're putting me on. - Not in the least. - Are you going to sit in, - You're all still here. So it can't be that dangerous. This is our dangerous, little friend. This is what is known as a tanzanian wing beetle. It is found only in the lower foothills of Mawenzi. It has but a single sting. The sting of death. Now, when I take the lid off of the jar, No one will be allowed to move. For a single movement might attract or discourage our little friend. And the rules demand total impartiality. Why did you open the window? For the same reason there are empty chambers in the revolver when one plays russian roulette. Our little friend might not decide to honor one of us with a sting. - But fly into the garden instead... - Where he'll sting some innocent person? A salute. Here it comes. No talk to. Even though he seemed pleasant on the surface. George Youngmeyer was burning with revenge. He wanted Glenn out of the way. This way, Mr. Marshall. I'm the intense eletrocussion computer. When I light yellow, a minnor light eletrical shock discharge to one of the club members. When I light blue, I will emit a stronger shock to one of you. And when I light red that is the ultimate. Now the Contessa is ready to throw the final switch. That will begin our game of death, good luck. And Mr. Marshall, you will notice there is an empty seat just as in russian roulette there is an empty chamber in the revolver. - Are we ready? - No, stop. Shut up! The process is irreversible. Once it is started it cannot be stopped. So just shut up. Is me! Is me! It's only the blue light. Don't give me charge to see who are? Might seen blow out, before you very eyes. If you get it. A really if you get it. You like that? Yeah, out of my life, once and for all. Out my life for good. Mr. Marshall! Excuse me if I smoke. Oh yes, yes. The plot against Glenn failed, but the electrocution death was the turning point for Gretta. She refused to be threatened anymore by Youngmeyer. She told George to stay out of her life, forever. Glenn and Gretta were very much in love. And they were to be married the next day. Glenn, look out! These gentlemen have a package for you, Contessa. - Special delivery. - Uh, thank you. This is what I owe you. This is what I owe you. May I say we're going to have a ball. The ball is actually a construction ball. It weighs exactly 1250 pounds. And not this. Normally it is used for knocking down buildings. - Two and a half foot thick. - They give or take a centimeter or two. the support is the one and a half inch rope. Is laboratory tested to withstand the weight of 0.9 metric tons, yeah? 2000 pounds. That the ball will be traveling in a predescribed circle. Until it reaches a full speed at which time the rope will be tossed against the saw player. Scientifically sharpened for this occasion, yeah? Gradually the rope will cut until it is cut clean through and the ball will fall. The ball will fall. I like that. Poor souls. Gretta could do me a lot of good. Finish your story, conductor. Gretta went off with a nice young man, and lived happily ever after. Isn't that a nice story? Don't look so sad my friend you've still got though I heard all the rest of them. - And I wanted Gretta. - Forget it you can't have them. Coming back to the musicians in the car up ahead. Why don't we make a package deal save a lot of time? Time is all I have. - No package deals, no sparrow falls... - That you don't know. Why do you go to such bothering pain? For so many insignificant cases. Every creature on earth is meaningful to me. After all I made it. They made a lot of mistakes. The only mistake I made is trusting you. The earth is mine. I'm taking over. You're blind if you can't see what's happening. Sooner or later they'd have to make a deal with me. Out of pity I cast you down on earth. Don't push me. I'll open the gates of hell. Hey, George, I'm starving how about some hamburgers and beer. There's no food on this train. What kind of train is this? Some call it the heavenly express. Others, Satan's Cannonball. But we guarantee to deliver every passenger to his right destination. Like I really wish our bus hadn't broken down, you know? No way. I think this train is cool. From the top. Daddy’s in the dining room, Sortin’ through the news. Mama’s at the shopping mall, Buyin’ new shoes. Everybody’s got something to do, Everybody but you. Come on and dance with me Dance, dance with me Come on and dance with me Dance, dance with me Everybody’s got something to do, Everybody but you. And now for the case of Claire Hanson. There's someone who loves me. Why shouldn't she? She's rich. Secure. Her husband adores her. You bought her love with bribes. Claire would love me even if she shouldn't were in bribes. Shall I show you what she's really like? Show me. The case of Claire Hansen. A highly respected surgeon. A devout catholic and wife to Nobel prize winner, James Hansen. It is midnight, the time of dark dreams. And Claire Hansen is about to begin a living nightmare. Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil! - Acthung! - Heil Hiltler! I've bring a message from the Fuerer. You haven't met your quota for the last three weeks. Your quota has been filled. And now intermission at the ballet. Interwiew of Coultbert Callahan. I've seen better, I've seen worse. We had it. Just had it. How this company compares with? - Are on television, are we? - Oh, yes. Mr. Weiss, I'm only the police in the fifth precinct. But, please. the rest of the world I don't think I can care. I... I look for. All right, we'll find this son of the bitch. I can't arrest him, Mr. Weiss. Why can't you arrest a murderer? Because all this happened many years ago in germany, we had no jurisdiction. No jurisdiction? No arrest? Kill my family. Easy, Mr. Weiss. Take it easy. Come on, control yourself. That's him! - Easy, easy. - That's him! Well, now we know where he lives. This is the one. This is the one See? See? This one. Yes, it's a striking resemblance. But, uh, the date of this paper is april 1944. It can't be the same man. I mean, he hasn't he hasn't aged a day in 35 years. That guy we saw in the theater. Facelift, plastic surgery equal. I mean nothing could make a 60 70 year old man look that young. - I admit the faces are... - I want him punish. God damn it it can't be him. Can't you see that? Now you take it easy. Good night, Mr. Weiss. You will notice, students, that under a satisfactory distal block anesthesia, the area is prepped in the usual manner. This patient was presented with a 10 centimeter complex laceration of the upper right lung. With stellate laceration of the resign artery and a community fracture of the upper flatte rib structure. I'm now using sharp and blunt abridgement to remove all foreign body materials... Attention! Dr. Claire Hanson, please come to room 322. Dr. Claire Hanson. Well, uh, he's a white caucasian. Late seventies, named Abraham Weiss. Multiple fractures. Vertebrae broken in three places. The assailant must have had tremendous strength. This tattoo is a nazi concentration camp identification number. But this 666 occurred at the time of his death. - Lieutenant? - Was the victim dead? When you found him? Well, he lived for only a few moments. What did he say he said? He said a... Look at the wall. That's all but there. Were no walls, it was a parking lot. Thank you, officer. What I have to say to you tonight may cause you pain. It may disillusion you. It may even make you hate me. I am here to shatter a myth. You may well believe in this myth. You may hold it absolutely sacred. And I take no joy in destroying your beliefs. I feel compelled to speak out. I'm sorry for the pain that my statement will cause. But sometimes truth causes pain. Indeed it now appears that Jesus Christ as we know him in the scriptures never existed. The Christ that we have come to know was invented by men for their own purposes. In the first place, in ancient times, the word christ was not the name of a person. But the title of a public office in the first century hundreds of persons could have been referred to as christ. In fact, there is not a single written reference to a man called Jesus in existence today. Other than the literary creations of the authors of the gospels and the new testament. The lone exception occurs in Josephus, a brief passage mentioning and praising Jesus. Reputable scholars today agree that this brief passage is a forgery. I propose... to build a culture upon the premise that god is dead. For my part... He never existed. And if the christian god is dead, so it is with all other gods. There is no supreme being. We are alone. - It's not too late, James. - Too late for what? To stop the publication. I spent four years on this book, Claire. I believe it is the most important work of my life. And if there is a God, what will happen to you? I suppose I'll go to hell. James, when I joined this foundation you told me that I would have a free hand. But haven't you. Yes? Thank you. A Mr. Papini to see you. - I don't know any Paupini. - Uh, okay, get rid of him. Don't alarm yourself, Dr Hansen. I just want to help you. I don't know you and I don't need your help. Now uh, leave. Everyone needs help, Mr. Nobel prize winner. - Especially you. - Out. Look at this, Dr. Hansen. - Sit down, Mr... - Papini. - What can I do for you, Mr. Papini. - It's what I can do for you, doctor. - All right, what can you do for me? - You're on the way to hell. If you would read my book you would realize that this is all wasted on me. It is far more terrible to be possessed. When satan remains invisible. Mr. Papini. I'll be frank. Thanks to contemporary research, that imaginary being satan has completely disappeared. His place has been taken by scientific reality. Hysterics, miracles and delusions, al fall within the province of the neurosurgeon. Not the priest or witch doctor. I appreciate your concern, Mr. Papini will you please... For now. Hey, what are you doing here, buddy? What are you doing here? Hey, turn around and talk to us, what are you doing here? The Hansens live here. Hey, you know the Hansens, do you? - I'm protecting Mr. Hansen. - From who? - The devil. - The devil? Let's go buddy. Come on. Hey, watch my glasses. The devil is coming! Jimmy boy, come on in. I gotta wait for her. What makes you think she is coming back? I still gotta wait. - Who is it? - Police, open up. - Get your boss. - Wait a minute. It's all right. Go back to bed. Ever hear of a man named Weiss? A 70 year old jew. - No. - He seemed to know you. So? Where are you from, Mr. Olivier? Really officer, at this hour of the night. Never mind. You see, Mr. Olivier. I get lots of time. Time is all I have. And I'm going to spend an awful lot of it. Checking on you. Good night, Mr. Olivier. "Claire Hansen, I've warned your husband but he does not believe. I'm hoping you will receive this letter before it's too late. I won't let them have you, beware, for out of the pits of hell satan has come for you. In god's name, Papini." Satan? You have been chosen to combat the evil of Satan. And his emissaries on earth god has granted special powers to those who are pure in thought and kind in heart. This is your cross to bear. We cannot choose our fate. Nor the times we are born to live in. It is not by accident that you have mett he devil's emissary. You are one of the chosen. He can never destroy you. Now, you have a task to perform. Look down at the floor. It is an ancient box made of the true wood. of the cross of our lord who died of it. Guard this box will, Dr. Claire Hansen. For it, is your mission to remove the heart of the devil's demon. Olivier. And secure it in this holiest of vessels. Come up, Mr. Papini. - Why do you wear white? - I find it becoming. Deceptive is the word. Red is your color. - Have you come to challenge me? - I came to the battle. You are a default monk. You are not pure heart. We scourt you to the battle. The son of god died for man's sins. I hope my sin died with him. God has only one son and his name is Satan. Fear you speak that name in the same breath as a true son. What is your name? In the eyes of god I command you to tell me your name. I am Ishtar. You say he called you yesterday? Yes. I drove him to the pier and he said he had an appointment in the roundhouse. Any reason to believe he'd commit suicide. - I didn't know him that well. - He was murdered. Held under the water till he was drowned there are bruises on his neck and shoulders. Mrs. Hansen, who'd want to kill them? I couldn't say. My husband told me he was a defrocked monk. That he once encountered the devil. - Why'd he call you? - To warn me. - Against what? - I'm afraid you wouldn't understand. Try, please try me. He warned you against what? - Satan. - Who? Satan. Satan? Uh... That'll be all, miss Hansen. I'm sorry to have troubled you. Really, Mr. Stern. Is this necessary? You know this man? - Never saw him before. - You can go, Mrs. Hansen. Mr. Olivier, may have your attention, please? Look. See, the same 666. Was on Jim's Scalp, the parking attendant. Mrs. Hansen. I said you can go. This man was murdered by Jim. Seems you have a double mystery on your hands. - You can go. - Thank you. You know, you've got some kind of a fix on that guy. He hasn't done a damn thing. I know... I know... where it is. I know. Now let me show you. There now you see, Peter. That's world war one, 1914. A long long time ago. Now look over here as over here that's that's the franco-prussian war of 1870. 1870, with Bismarck, 1875. - Think of that neather... - And he's the same guy. Yeah he hasn't aged a day. In all those years. This is what Weiss meant when he said look on the wall. Let's shake something out of that son of a bitch. Go, let's go. Something, Jesus. I represent a foundation who is very interested in your work. I'm not interested in the foundation. Look... I think it would be advantageous if we met... I'm sorry sir, but I don't meet with strangers. Dr. Hansen. I am not a stranger. We've met many times before in the past. - But I have no recollection of it. - You'll remember the face. Look I'm afraid, I don't understand. A boat will meet you with the pier, be there. Hello? What now? Mr. Olivier lives on the remote side of island. You wait here. But who am I wait? It's the most important meeting of your life. You wait here. All right, come on. Open! Open! Come on. What'a matter? Hey! Stan. Stanley! I can't open. I can't open that damn thing. Peter. Peter! Up here, Dr. Hansen. - Do you know who I am? - You must be Mr. Olivier. We want you to join our organization, doctor. I'd have to know a great deal more about it. Oh, you know all about us. - We two believe God is dead. - Just who are you? I serve the master. It'll be your privilege. - To serve him too. - I serve no one. - I'm my own master. - There is only one master. And his name is Satan. I don't believe in satan any more than I believe in God. Recant! Never. Recant. Before this touches the floor. For it is by giving that one receives. it is by self-forgetting that one finds. It is by forgiving that one is forgiven. It is by dying that one awakens to eternal life. Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! You see, I won Claire failed. She was faithful to the end. That is victory. - But my man walked out alive. - Only because I let him. I grant you Claire, but you can't deny me her husband. He said god is Dead. I hate to separate them. I leave the decision to Claire. - That isn't fair. - Fair? Did I hear you say fair? Gentlemen, it's dawn. Gonna be a bad boy, Stayin’ after school. Principal is workin’ hard, Makin’ new rules.
