Okay, is there a reason you're trying to kill me? Yeah, I had to get you here by 8 p.m. Annie's throwing a surprise party for you. Will you please try to act surprised when you walk in? Yeah, yeah, I got you. I got you, man. You think he'll be surprised? I'm so excited. It's gonna be great. - Don't forget, surprised. - Yeah, yeah. Oh, oh, oh, look, look. - You look great. - Surprise! Oh, shit! It was all Annie. - We got you! - What's up? Good to see you. Come here. Mm! - Come here. - What is...? What? I'm so proud of you. I don't know how you did this because I just closed the deal like an hour ago. Yeah, that's the thing. I had this planned for weeks. Because I knew you were gonna close the deal. You're, uh... You really are something special. You know that? - Thank you. - Thank you. I need to borrow him for one second, okay? Hey, everybody, grab your glass because I'm about to make a toast. To my best friend, and now the number-one earner at the company, Scott Howard! - Wait, you need this. - Thank you. Appreciate you. Thank you, guys, so much for coming. This is not just a victory for me. This is a victory for all of us, right? And to my wife, I love you, I love you, I love you. - Thank you. - I love you too. Yeah, bud! You remember that conversation we had about buying that house up in Napa? Yeah. You sure that's something you want to do? I'm positive. I want that house. I want a family. I want our kids to be able to play outside. Could be nice. Get away from all of this noise. Yeah. So this house has been on the market for a while. Let's just not get our hopes up, okay? I know, I know. I'm just excited that we're finally going to see it! This is it. 6741 Arbor Road. Hope there's a house at the end of this road. Wow, this is so beautiful. And here we are. Wow. Doesn't look like anyone's home. No, I hear someone in the back. Come on. Something tells me Domino's won't deliver. This is so pretty. Watch your step. Oh, honey, look. I don't know. This might be the one. This is incredible. - We need to go. - Here he comes. - Wait, wait. - We need to go. Sorry, sorry, sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. We have a bounty on deer. They're eating up all the gardens. Go through them in nothing flat. But there's an upside. You like venison? I-I don't know. - You don't know? - I don't know. I'm Charlie Peck. Welcome to Foxglove. Scott Howard. This is my wife, Annie. - Hi. Nice to meet you. - Hi. I guess you want to see the house, huh? - Yes. Yeah. - Come on up. Sorry. Sorry about that. We're gonna be laughing about this soon. Come on. - Yeah. - You're gonna love my house. It might need a freshen-up, but, uh... I think you're gonna have to agree, it's got great bones. You guys got kids? Uh... Not yet. We raised two kids in this house, my wife and I. Ellen. She's gone now. I lost her to cancer two years ago. I'm sorry to hear that. So, what do you do, Scott? I'm a creative director at Saunders and Ruddick in San Francisco. It's a branding and advertising agency. Annie, do you work? I mostly write for women's magazines. Articles about injustice, women empowerment, self-love, that sort of thing. This view is beautiful. My great-great-grandfather built this house in 1905. It's the only house I ever lived in. Why do you call it Foxglove? The entire valley used to be covered with the stuff. Now it's kind of rare. Foxglove is poisonous, isn't it? Highly. Come on, I'm gonna give you the grand tour. The house, it backs up to a wooded nature preserve. Lots of privacy, huh? - Nobody can build behind us. - I love this marble. Do you cook, Annie? She's a damn good cook. And a great baker. And even better wife. My grandmother taught me to cook. - Really? - Yeah. - That's a beautiful stone. - Thank you. - Is that an emerald? - It is. - Birthstone? No. - Yeah. - Yeah. - So am I. - No way. Really? - Yeah. We're not gonna get into how many years. That is crazy. Yep. Wow, that's a good sign. That's a good sign. So here's where I rule, Scott. And I watch a lot of sports in here and read. Hey, football's on. You got a team? Yeah, yeah. Raiders. - Rams here. - That's unfortunate. - You watch on that? - Yeah. You got a big flat-screen, right? - Yeah, a little something. - We're basic cable around here, but you can put in satellite. Okay. He's got more guns. - Nice-looking family. - Oh, why, thank you. After I sell the house, Cassidy, my daughter, she wants me to move down to Florida and live with them. Your wife was really beautiful. Yeah. We always had a lot of love in this house. It's not that bad. - You want to see the upstairs? - Yes. - Yes. - Come on. Come on. Honey? Coming, coming. Just looking at... all this old shit. Oh. A lot of yellow. This room hasn't been redone in 20 years. So I figured whoever buys the place will just make it their own. Beautiful terrace, though. Yeah. Hey. - You scared me. - You okay? Night-blooming jasmine comes through that terrace at night. Oh, it's just heaven. Oh, uh... Here's your linen closet. - Nice. - Pretty much room for everything. This is a great kids' room. Originally, this was the nursery. And then after the kids grew up and left home, we turned it into Ellen's sewing room. I'll give you a minute. I freaking love this. - Just be cool. - I'm being cool. - I'm being totally cool. - Okay. Take a breath. Here we go. All right. There's been a lot of birthdays, cocktail parties, graduations, weddings, Fourth of July out here. This is a special place, isn't it? You see it, don't you, Annie? I'm gonna go... check out this pond. So, uh, Charlie... How, uh...? How motivated are you? If you want to know how much, the asking price is 3.5 million. If you can't afford it, you probably shouldn't even be here. Annie. - Hm? - We're leaving. Oh. Thank you for showing us your home. You bet. What'd you think? Well, it's... Maybe not. Oh. Listen. You have to understand, I've had people salivating to buy this house, but I'm very particular, and I just like you two. I will throw in the furniture, all the equipment, my tapestry, and I'll knock off $200,000, and you can have it for 3.3. We still have a few more places we got to see, but we'll let you know. I want you to have this house. And I know she wants this house. And you remember, if Mama ain't happy, nobody's happy. - Thanks for the advice. - All right. And you look out for the deer. - Okay. - Ha, ha. I told you, you'd be laughing on the way home. - You... Yeah. - Oh, man. - Did you just roll up the window on him? - Yeah. Rolled up the window on the Bambi killer. So, what'd you think of the house? It's magical, right? Yeah, if old is magical. Come on. Foxglove. You really want this place, don't you? I do. But you gotta want it too. It's an old house. It's gonna require a lot of work. I don't do that kind of stuff. But I don't mind a lot of work, and we could get someone to help us. And to be honest, I already have a thousand ideas. I could see it in your eyes the whole time. It'll be where our future is. We get the house. We get the kids. We get the whole thing. What do I say to that, huh? All right. I'll talk to Marvin and the partners tomorrow, see if I can swing it. Yes! Do you think we could move in next week? This to the kitchen. These are gonna go in the bathroom. Yeah? Got it? Thank you. Okay, this is gonna go upstairs in the master bedroom. And you know that little piece? We're gonna put that in the other bedroom. It's all yours. It's all ours now. Thank you. Well, this is the big handoff. Here's the keys... to all the doors and locks. I got it all marked, color-coded. Thank you. Foxglove is yours now. We'll take good care of her. - I'm gonna hold you to that. - I promise. Cross my heart. Aw... Ellen used to do that. Cross her heart. Listen, Charlie, I know you have our e-mails. Keep in touch, we'd like to know how you're doing. Right, Scott? Yeah, just let me call you back. Okay, bye. Did I tell you about the sprinklers? - Yeah. Yeah. - Yes, I did. I did. You take care. Have a good, uh... - Good time in Florida, buddy. - Yep. - I feel bad for him. - What? Don't feel bad for Charlie, you know? Feel good for us. Okay. Make me some eggs, woman! Make me some eggs. Yes! - We did it. - We did it. You happy? - I am. - Good. Now the journey... can begin. Say goodbye to Charlie. Annie? Annie? Annie? This house looks good on you. You're so beautiful. Here's to us. And our new home. I love you. And there's the owner. He's just standing there, staring at us. I mean, he comes towards us with a rifle. - Bam! - Oh, okay. - Shot a deer right behind us. - Yeah. - Is this guy crazy? - Man, he country. Then he said, "You like venison?" Not this fresh. I don't want to see it get killed. That's just the best way. Hello? Watch the deer out here in the country. - Oh, yeah. - Right. They better watch this ride. What the hell? What's up? There's a cigarette burn on my car seat. Dude, you gotta stop smoking. That's you. Me? This is my temple, Scott. I would never smoke in here. Okay. Goddamn! Nice going, Mike. Rachel, please, shut your magic lips. I didn't do it. - Did I say you did? - Well, it made... You made it seem like I did. Give them a year. They'll be living next door. I hope not. That's so shady. Thank you so much. I am going to get us a booth. - Okay. - Okay. And what would you like? Um, which do you prefer better, the chocolate or the vanilla? The swirl. - Swirl? - Swirl. - Swirl! - It's vanilla and chocolate together. Okay, so it's all mixed up. Like you? - Yeah, like me. - Okay. - Okay. - Let me give you a taste. I'll taste it. Okay, so... So now it's like a crime to talk? I don't have a problem with you talking. It's the way that you were talking. It's the what? It's the way that you were talking. She just asked me what flavor I wanted. And it seemed like you might as well have just given her a lick. Can we just move on with our day? You know, maybe snuggle on the couch a little bit? Apparently not. Annie, I left this on. Did you turn it off? So, essentially, when life calls for that recharge, you reach for Recover 180. You see? It sells itself, and what we do is, we hammer that home with the advertising that already exists on the bottle. Twice the electrolytes at half of the calories. - Scott's come up with a theory. - I gotta take this. Scott has a really interesting idea for a dual campaign. This is called the cloud kicker... Hey, baby, what's up? You're not gonna believe this. Charlie is outside cutting the grass. Wait, wait. What? Charlie's outside mowing our lawn. Literally, right now. - Why? - I don't know. Uh, I'll call you back, honey. Okay. Charlie! - Hey, hey. - Hi. - Good morning. - What are you doing? - What? - What are you doing? Oh. Heh. Well, I noticed that the grass was getting out of hand, and... You really gotta keep up with this. So I just... I just went ahead. Did you just get this out of the garage? That's where I keep it. Huh. What happened to Florida? I thought you'd be gone by now. Well, you know, it... Moving is a lot harder than I thought. I had, uh... I have a lot of loose ends. I'm gonna be leaving soon. Yeah. Yeah, it's hard to... Hard to say goodbye. - Yeah, I bet. - Mm-hm. Where are you staying? I'm at The Royal. It's a little hotel just right in the middle of the village. Right. Right, right. You know, Charlie, I appreciate what you're doing, but you don't have to do this. We've got it. Oh! Oh. Here's the reason I came by. Here's a list of local numbers. Plumber, an electrician, emergency numbers. Thought you might want to have it. You know we can Google this now? Yeah, but these people know the house, and they're not gonna gouge you on the price. You can't get that on the Internet. - You can't get that. - No, you can't. Well, he did a pretty good job. He also said it's probably the last time the lawn will need to be mowed this year, and he left the grass seed and the spreader at the front of the storage shed so that you could find it in April, and that you're gonna want to use steer manure, but that, you should buy that fresh. Oh, yeah, yeah. When I do my spring planting. Yeah. Eh... Is that it? I feel like you're not telling me everything, so spit it out. I invited him to Thanksgiving. - What? - It just slipped out of my mouth, but you should've seen how happy it made him. Baby, we don't know him. I know, but he's lonely, and he doesn't have any family here, and he's getting ready to be gone anyways, and... Yeah. Anything else? He's gonna bring the pies. He's gonna bring some pies. - He's gonna bring some pies. - Is that right? Okay. - Evidently. - Oh, that makes it all better. Okay, the doctor's here. Let's do it. - Don't drop it. - All right, here we go. - Okay. - Yes. - Boom. What does that look like? - Yes. - Is it good? - Perfect. We made it. Mm! Well... Stop. Oh, okay. Hey, the Bambi killer's here. Hey, Scott. - How's it going? - Happy Thanksgiving. - You too. - Hey. Thanks for the invite. It was her idea. Come on in. - Hi, Charlie. - Hello. How are you? Wow, the house feels so alive. - Thank you. - Yeah. - Here, as promised. - Oh, perfect. I got an apple and a pumpkin. Oh, I love pumpkin. - Oh, smells so good. - It's definitely going down. - Uh-uh. - Okay. I'm gonna finish. Okay. Okay. You really know how to make a house a home. - Thank you, Charlie. - Come on. I'll show you what progress we've made. Look, we still got a couple more rooms to... - To paint and everything. - Yeah. But we're pretty close. - It's a work in progress. - Oh, my. Oh, wow. - Yeah. - Jeepers. I could just get lost in that. - Just take a look around. - Okay. Annie said that your trip got delayed to Florida. So you're still around for a little while, huh? Yes, uh, my daughter, Cassidy, she wants to fix up a special room for me there. Of course, it has to be perfect. But, uh, that's my Cassidy. She's Daddy's little girl. So, uh... Here you go. - What happened to the tapestry? - The what? The tapestry that conveyed with the house. It was my gift to you. Oh, yes, yes, yes, um... Didn't really feel like it was us, you know? This painting, though, this is what makes Annie really happy. Something that we bought when we first got married. She likes to see this every morning when we wake up, and I can't blame her. It's pretty stunning, don't you think? Yeah, it's not for everybody. We were talking about changing the floors. Maybe go with a dark wood throughout, but... I haven't quite gotten to that yet, so... We'll figure it out. That's it. We got to make it our own, right? That's what... That's what we're here for. Well, happy Thanksgiving, man. What should we toast to? Here's to Annie's meal. - Here's to Annie. - To your new house. - All that hard work. - Happy Thanksgiving. I'm so happy for you guys. Oh, this is great. First of all, we just want to thank you guys for being here on our first Thanksgiving in our new home. When you're done with the changes, the place will be great. Oh, really? Really? - Break out this back wall, right? - Totally. You guys are wasting square footage. That dining room in there, it's small by modern standards, but if you start expanding it and knocking it out and everything, you're gonna... You're gonna ruin the integrity of it. - Houses have integrity? - Of course they do, Mike. - Yeah? - Yes. - Some people don't, but... - Oh...! At least the houses worth living in do, that's for sure. I was a structural engineer. I don't know if Scott told you that. That's... I'm retired. I built roads and bridges, and I believe that every one of them I built, - I put my soul into it. - Mm. And I believe that they have souls themselves. Bullshit. - Mike. Stop it. - Listen, I think he has a point. But isn't this kind of the way of the world? Out with the old, in with the new. Let's rebuild the Taj Mahal, huh? This is not the Taj Mahal, Charlie. - You're a little crazy. - Right? You having trouble with that? Just give me a minute. Hey, Charlie, top me off. - I'm gonna go out for a smoke. - Sure. All of it. Giddyup, cowboy. Thanks, Charlie. Charlie, no! No! Why would you do that? - Ah! Got it. - All right. Hey, let's give a hand for Scott. - There you go. - All right. Who's having white? Ooh. Needed some fresh air. What a meal, right? - Oh, Annie, she's a great cook. - Yeah. Oh. - Smoke, Charlie? - Oh, no, thanks. Gave it up 30 years ago. Good for you. Must have been hard to give all this up. Yes, it was. Trust me. Have you? What? Given it up. Scott said you came over to mow their grass. Had to be done. Grass was getting out of control. So you keep an eye on the place. That it? Mm. Drive by from time to time, yeah. And I also hunt. Right here in these woods. You ever hunt at night, Charlie? Mike... hunting after dark is illegal. Oh, okay. - Because I don't know. - Yeah. Oh, what am I doing? Wouldn't want to ruin your nice lawn. I'll toss it in the garbage. See you inside, Charlie. Nice vest. Great. Oh. That was probably the best meal ever made in this house. And good thing because I made you a doggie bag. This is gonna be gone before midnight. You truly are the lady of the house. Thank you. Enjoy the food. Have a great rest of the evening. Have a great retirement in Florida. "Enjoy your retirement." Hey. Mike's drunk. - I just had a theory. - Tell them what you told me. - All right. I'm gonna tell you. - Go ahead. - Annie. - What? What? I think it was that old dude who put the cigarette burns in my upholstery. - What? Charlie? - Mm-hm. Why would he do that? Because, and I apologize ahead of time, when I went out to have a smoke, - I took a piss on your roses. - Of course. We got four different bathrooms... Here's the point. Charlie thinks those are his roses. He thinks that I defiled his lawn. He still thinks this is his house. How would he know? - He's watching from the woods. - Okay. - Come on, man. - Okay. Look, Scott, I bet you, if we went out into the woods, we would find proof that I was right. Wanna put your money where your mouth is? - Yeah. How much? - Five. - Don't do it. - Five hundred. Let's do it. - That's a bet. - Oh, God. There's a senior citizen in the woods. We gonna take care of this for you. Good luck! - Oh, yeah. - Okay, tough guy. - That's right, baby. - This... This is some Scooby-Doo shit right here. Scooby-Doo? Why did you move all the way out here? We had it wired back in the city. You know, Annie wanted to start a family. I love her, so... What's wrong? You can see right into the house from here. Told you. Look at that. Scott. There's a path that leads right into the woods. Okay, that's where he shot Bambi. Right over there, man. So where do you think he is? Come on. - You sure about this? - Come on. How much you wanna bet they got lost? Don't even tell me. Maybe we should have given them some bread crumbs or something, find their way home. What did you think about Charlie? I think he's... - kind of hot for an older guy. - What? - Rachel. - Oh, come on. Tell me you don't think so too. No. Okay. You know what it is? I think it's this... The manly man thing that he has, you know? Like, it's something our grandfathers had and our dads had. I don't know. I feel sorry for him. He's such a sweetheart. Our poor city boys. You know they're lost, right? This looks like some sort of fire road. That's convenient, huh? Charlie parks the car, leaves it here, walks through the woods. He's at your place in no time. Look, there's fresh tire tracks. Might be hunters, man. There's hunters out here in these woods. Who's that? Is he coming at us? No, he's backing away. Scott, he's backing away. - So what? We going? We going? - Hey! Who was that? This is not how I saw us living here. Me either. I just feel like this is unnecessary. Annie. You want this tied to your landline or your cell phones? Cell phones. Thank you. - Oh, shit. - Hey! Hey! - This guy. - Randall! Stop drilling holes in my house. - Hey, hey. Keep working. - What the hell are you doing? What are you doing here? I was down the road. I was fishing. I saw the security van go by. You been having a problem? Look, I got a prowler in the woods. It's kids. - What kids? - It's high school kids. They sneak out into these woods, and they party after dark. - No. - This is not necessary. What is necessary is that I protect my wife. If you wanna protect your wife, get a gun. No guns on my property. You understand? What do you got against guns? I know what guns can do, and I'm not talking about killing a defenseless deer in the woods, okay? When I was 12, my brother was gunned down in the street. I know what guns can do, Charlie. I'm sorry for your loss. Enjoy Florida. Hey, Randall. You be careful with these vines. It took 50 years for these things to grow on the house. Okay, Mr. Peck. It's not your house. Babe, what are you doing? I can't sleep. I keep hearing this creaking sound. Honey, it's an old house. Creaking is what they do. Scott! Scott? Let's go! Get in the truck! Oh, come on. What is he doing now? I thought he left. I don't know. Why is he in the shed? - Just stay in the car. - Scott. - Hey, Scott. I was out... - Put the gun away! All right, all right. I was hunting along the creek. The deer tore up your flower bed. I was just getting potting soil, Scott. Charlie. Charlie... No guns on my property. I've asked you that. Anybody can hunt along the creek. Not just me. - Anybody. - Charlie, I'm telling you right now, you. No guns on my property ever. - All right, Scott. - Ever. I didn't mean to ruin your afternoon. - It's okay. It's okay. - Annie, I... - Is that a spruce? - It's a Christmas tree, Charlie. Well, they don't lose their needles so quick. Here, let me help you with that. Here you go. Here. Use this. There you go. Did you find the Christmas decorations yet? No. Oh, you've gotta see this. Oh, my God. All that for one tree, huh? No, most of these lights are for the outside of the house. Honey, do you see all this stuff? - Yeah, I see it. - Here. Let's get this inside, I'll show you what's what. - Yeah, yeah. - No, no, no. Look, Charlie, Annie and I will take care of this on our own time. Thank you. But I'm just trying to help, Scott. Yeah. I appreciate your help, but, look, the next time you wanna stop by, you call or you text first. You don't just show up. Oh... Hey, I'm sorry. I'm sure where you come from, people don't just drop by, do they? - No. - No. All right. I'll honor that. We good? We're good, Charlie. We're good. Merry Christmas, Annie. Thank you. Honey, what is the problem? Something is really off with that guy. Do you have to make him feel so unwelcome? He is unwelcome. He spies on us from the woods. You said you went back there and you heard kids. Okay, that one time, yes, but... Look, whose side are you on? Whose side am I...? What is really the problem here? The man acts like the house still belongs to him. Oh, my God. Come on, Scott. Give the guy a break. He's lost his wife. He lost his house. This is our house, not his. - He doesn't live here anymore. - I get that. I drive an hour and a half to the city every day, and I'm back every night. I get up, I go to work, I come home, I go to bed, and then I go back to work again. How is this place supposed to feel like it's mine if he won't leave? Do you still want this? - What? - Do you still want this? Still want what? This. Our home. I just need some time to adjust. Because I love it here. I know. Okay. We can agree these fourth-quarter numbers, they're staggering. Thank you for a great meeting. - Thanks. - Congratulations, Scott. They all believe that you're a marketing genius. Yeah, that was, uh... That was part of the plan. Ms. Richards, one thing you should know about me. I am very passionate about what I do. You won't be disappointed. Jillian. Jillian. A few of us are gonna go and have a drink afterwards. Would you like to join us? Season's greetings, Annie. - Charlie. - Hi. Hi. I brought you and Scott a bottle of wine from my neighbor's vineyard. Oh, wow. I wanna make amends for causing any kind of drama. Thank you. It's okay. I tried to call him. But his cell phone said his mailbox was full. - About the other day... - Yeah. That wasn't your fault. Scott's brother was killed, and it's a trigger for him. - Guns are... - Yeah. Yes. It must have been devastating for him, so I understand. - Yeah. Yeah. - Yeah. So you're putting up the lights, are you? I am. I am. - Beautiful job so far. - Thank you. - You're doing this by yourself? - Yes. Do you want to help? - Oh, yeah. - Nice. - Teamwork makes the dream work. - Yeah. - Hopefully we can... - Where is Scott? Uh... Actually, no. - He's at work. - Yeah? Yeah, he'll be home later. Thank you so much for the help. - Glad to do it. - You want something to drink? Um... Would you like me to open this bottle of wine? It needs to breathe anyway before Scott gets home. - Yeah, that's a great idea. - You know? All right. Okay. You don't really strike me as a city girl. - You could tell? - Hm. I grew up in a small town in Indiana, so I'm really a country girl at heart. - Really? - Yeah. The city's great, if you're single and you're young, but... I wanna raise my kids in the clean, fresh air. - So you are gonna have kids. - Yeah. You got any glasses? Oh, yeah, yeah. Sorry about that. Nobody tells you how hard it is to raise children, that's for sure. I mean, I know that my kids caused a few gray hairs on my head. You know, in the end, children are your biggest challenge that you will ever have and the greatest blessing. Amen. Cheers? Cheers. Mm. That needs to breathe. I'll be right back. Oh, okay. Hey, I just texted you. I know you sent a text, but why didn't you call? I'm in a meeting, and it's loud, and I didn't wanna step out. Are you at a bar? Yes, it's just drinks with clients. Yeah, but you know why I'm upset, right? The text. Yes. I get it. Um... Look, it's not like that, all right? This is a part of my job. All right? It's how we pay for your house. My house? Annie, look, let's just not - get into that again, please. - You know what? Never mind. Sorry I bothered you. - Everything okay? - Yeah. Yeah. Scott's just gonna be late. Trouble at home? You've got the look. I really, really should get home. Hm. Uh... No. I can't do this. I need to get my ass back to Napa. - I'm sorry. - That'd be best. Good night, then. Good night. Thank you for being such a sweetheart, Charlie. Appreciate it. Officially, merry Christmas. Thank you. Merry Christmas. - See you. - See you. Bravo, Annie. Bravo. Annie! House looks fantastic. How'd you do all that by yourself? I didn't. Wild guess... Charlie? We both know you weren't gonna help me with the lights. This is about the texting? You know what's funny? I'm sitting here, waiting for you to call, like you usually do, and you don't. - Sitting here with Charlie. - What? You're sitting here with Charlie. No, we're not doing that. We're not doing that. Instead of calling, you text. - You're worried about a text. - What happened last time? It's not okay for me having drinks with my client, That's not the point. It's okay for you to sit up here and share wine with the man that I specifically asked you not to have in this house. You text instead of call. The last time you did that, - you were with somebody. - I apologized for that, okay? Look, we went to therapy. Then we got married. Then we bought this house, and now we're here to start a family. Do you trust me? You know what? Sleep in a different room. I don't wanna talk about this shit. Living the dream. Okay. Honey, what are you doing? I can hear sounds upstairs. You scared me. Okay, come here. Come here. - What? - Hey. You said you... You heard sounds? - Yeah, I heard sounds. - Do you know what it was? I thought it was you. I think I saw him in the house. - Who? - Charlie. How could he even get in the house? You changed the locks. We have the security system. Okay. I'm tripping. I don't know. All right. I think maybe you've been drinking a little too much. Look, I'm sorry for waking you up. It's okay. I'm also sorry about earlier. I'm sorry too. Come here. I love you. You look good. Thank you. So, what do you say we go on a real date tonight? Dinner? We'll go to that Italian spot that we read about. I'd like that. All right. Could I get a medium latte? - Name? - It's Scott. Thanks, man. I don't mean to stare. Grady Kramer. You just bought the Peck house, right? - Yeah. - My wife and I, we live, like, a mile down the road from you. Oh, nice to meet you. We heard you got a... A damn good deal on Charlie's place. - Well, we did okay. - Yeah. Charlie's quite a guy. Just don't look too close under the mask. What do you mean? You know his wife died in that house. Yeah, yeah. You know, cancer. Well, maybe she had cancer, maybe she didn't. All I know is that one fine day, Mrs. Charlie took Mr. Charlie's shotgun... ...shoved the barrel in her mouth. At least, that's how Charlie explained it to the police. - Grady. - Ah. Medium latte for Scott. I don't know. You think that's blood? Yeah. Honey, when did you become a detective? And why are you trying to scare me? Oh, God, I'm so sorry. I'm not trying to scare you. - It's just... - Okay. the details surrounding Ellen's death are sketchy, to say the least, so I looked it up on the Internet, and the DA was considering a murder charge. A murder charge. But then why didn't they pursue it? - Lack of evidence. - Honey, this doesn't make him a murderer. Okay, well, we don't know anything about this man, and I've seen the way that he looks at you. Now Charlie is after me? Since day one. That's ridiculous. Oh, my God. You don't see it? What does it matter? He's going to Florida any day now. Is he? Because his departure date just keeps moving. So, what do you want me to do? Okay, it's simple. I want you to tell him... Tell him that he's not welcome. Okay? And if you can't tell him, then-then I'll... I'll tell him myself. You gonna tell him? You don't think I'll tell him? I think we should go to dinner. - We're gonna be late. - Okay. That was it. Yeah, that was it. Oh, this place is definitely a keeper. Good pasta, good wine. Honey, you gonna be able to drive? Yeah. Not only can I drive, I... I was thinking maybe we could stop for a little nightcap. Oh, baby, everything is closed. What about The Royal Hotel? I don't think that's a good idea. Come on, let's just take a little sneak peek. Honey. To see what old Charlie's up to when he's not haunting our house. Honey, yeah, I don't... - I don't think... No. - Yeah. No... - Oh, come on, honey, let's go. - No, no, no. Scott. - Annie. - Hi. - Hello. - Charlie. - What are you doing downtown? - Hey, man. We were just, uh... Just having dinner at Fellini's. I'll buy you a drink. Annie, what are you having? I'm good. I'm actually gonna drive. Oh, well, Scott, pick your poison. - Tequila shot. - You know what? But we're not gonna stay late, Scott has work in the morning. It's okay. Ah. - What were we drinking to? - How about Florida? When are you leaving? - Scott. - No, no. I'm not trying to be rude. Just... Just remind me of this. Your, um, daughter... Your daughter, what part does she live in, again? Fort Myers. Can we get another round? This time, it's on me. All right. I'm... I'm going to pass. You have mine. Because tequila has a way of sneaking up on me. So do you, Charlie. So do you. You... You have a way of sneaking up on me. How's that? You looking for a new wife, Charlie? Okay, l-let's go, honey. It's getting late. I need an answer. Your question does not deserve an answer, Scott. If you wanna talk, we can do that some other time. - Perhaps I'll drop by the house? - No. God, no. Damn it, no. See, that's the problem, man. No, your days of dropping by are over. All right. Well, then someplace less public. Stay away from my wife, okay? She's just too nice to tell you herself. So I'm telling you. Capiche? You've made your point. Let's go. Be careful on the road. Scott. So long, Chuck. Gotta go. Come on. I'm sorry. It's okay. Your husband has a mild concussion. We need to make sure he doesn't have internal injuries. I can get out of here tonight, right? Depends on the lab. Unfortunately, that means we gotta keep you overnight. The only problem with that is, I gotta go to work tomorrow, so... It's protocol. All right. The lioness sprints towards her prey, a zebra just outside the grasslands... Why don't you go home and get some rest? I'll be fine. - Honey, I can stay. - I know, I know. But I'll be all right. You just want me to get out of your bed so you have more room. That's not the case. Mm-hmm. I'll pick you up in the morning when they discharge you. Yeah, I'll call you. Okay. - Love you. - I love you too. As for the zebra, there is no escape. Powerful jaws slowly and swiftly bring imminent death and darkness. What's up, Scott? Listen to me very carefully, all right? I can't prove it... but I-I got this feeling that it was Charlie who ran me off the road. Why would he do that? Because you were right. He's obsessed with the house, and now he's obsessed with Annie. Well, have you told Annie what you're telling me right now? I tried. I tried, man, but she just won't buy it. Look, I need you to do me a favor, all right? I need you to get Brian in IT to discreetly find out everything he can on Charlie Peck and his family. I really need to know who I'm dealing with. If there's anything to find on Charlie Peck, we're gonna find it. Hello? Charlie, you scared the shit out of me. Oh, I'm so sorry. I am so sorry. I-I heard about Scott, and I just wanted to drop by and-and, uh, give you this. I thought you might be hungry. How is he? He's okay. They're gonna keep him overnight. When I heard he was in the hospital, it made me think of Ellen, and when she was in the hospital with cancer. And I'd come home, and the house would be dark and empty, and I was pretty blue... and lonely, so... Anyway, I got you, uh, an everything pizza. You just pick off what you don't like. - All right? - Okay. And I'm... I'm sorry, uh, that I scared you. It's okay. - Uh, good night. - Good night. All right. Charlie. This pizza is huge. You're not gonna make me eat it alone, are you? - You want some company? - Come on in. Brian and I found out that old Charlie boy is - in some deep legal shit. - What? Yeah. You know, his entire construction business, it went under. There were lawsuits, government liens, charges of tax fraud. I mean, this guy was looking at some serious jail time. Yeah, he didn't wanna sell it. He had to. And he owed everybody. - What have I done? - I'm sorry, man. He's not the upstanding citizen that he wants us to think he is. Not exactly your traditional holiday meal, is it? No, but I'm starving, so this is perfect. On your way back to the city, just go by the house and check on Annie for me, okay? Make sure she's all right, call me back. - Of course, of course. - Cool? Yeah, I got you. You know those guys that wear yellow vests? - Oh, yeah. - You know, that stop traffic? - I was... That was me. - Mm. - And... Yeah. - No. And it just so happened that I turned my stop sign around for traffic, and she was the first car in line. And she was so... What the hell is Charlie doing here? And she had said... She had told me that, "I have to be somewhere," and I came over to her window... After 15 minutes of talking to her, I had a date with her. That's so sweet. Yeah, from there we just, like I said... - This is great wine, isn't it? - It's good. Would you like another glass? Yeah, that'd be great. So... Annie. Don't look over your shoulder, all right? But there's someone watching us... from outside the kitchen window. - Should I call the cops? - No. I'm sure it's those high school kids, - but I'm fed up. - Okay. I'm gonna go check it out. - All right. - All right. Hey! Mike? Charlie. - What are you doing out here? - I can explain. If I'd had a gun, I could have blown your head off. I know, man. Right now I feel like a damn fool. What did you expect to see? - I don't know. - Mike. Mike... This is not the suburbs. This is the country. People have guns. You've got to be careful. I know, man. I do not belong here. Where's your car? I just parked at the end of the driveway. I'll walk you to it. - You scared me to death. - Yeah, I know. You scared me. You're shaking like a leaf. You wanna have a cigarette, calm your nerves? - No, man. I'm good. - Go ahead, have a cigarette. - No, no, I'll just go... - No, no, no. I insist. Have a cigarette. May I have one? I thought you quit. Yeah. Right. Thank you. Here, let me help you. I'm gonna save mine for later. Okay. - Think I'm just gonna go. - All right. Hey. Do you believe in second chances? Yeah, sure. I think everybody deserves a second chance, even Peeping Toms. No, I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about in life. Like, if you lost everything that was important to you, and then you had a chance to get it all back, wouldn't you just go for it? - Hell, yeah. - Yeah. Well, that's like me. I have a chance to get it all back. All I have to do is just get rid of Scott. What the...? All right. Where am I gonna put you? - Hi. - Are you okay? Oh, I-I twisted my damn ankle. Oh, my God. Okay, just... There we go. I think I just hit something. Idiot. I was... Oh, let's put this up. I was chasing those kids. Then I hooked my foot into a tree root. I'm gonna, um, take your boot off - and just see if... - Yeah. - Here we go. Okay. - Ah, all right. - Right here. Just... - Ow! - Is it okay? Did that hurt? - Yeah. It's all right. Yeah, it's all right. Okay, I'm just gonna see if... I mean, it doesn't... Doesn't seem like it's swollen or anything. You might just have to rest it when you get to the hotel. Yeah. You definitely didn't break it. Thank goodness. Yeah, I think if you prop it up, maybe elevate it, you know, then it'll... Hopefully it'll be okay. Feel like you might need to just double-check and see a doctor. You know... those kids might come back. You think maybe I should stay? No, I think, you know, it's kids. I don't think I'm in any real danger or anything. Do you? No. I don't. And I need to get cleaned up. - Yeah. - I'm dirty. I'm so sorry. Could you just give me my boot, please? Yeah, let me help you. - You got it? Here. - Yeah, I have... I have things to do in the morning. Let me put it here for you. Anyway. - You got it? - Yeah. - You help me up? - Help up? - Sure. - Yeah. Here we go. Okay. Okay. Here, let me. There we go, there we go. Okay, here. Come around slowly. Just push... There we go. Hi. You've reached Annie. Leave a message. Hey. How you feeling? You're bringing my wife flowers now? It's foxglove. I haven't seen it around here in a long, long, long time. You okay? Look, I know about you. Your losses, your bankruptcy, why you sold us the house. So... get the fuck off of my property. Annie. Babe, I would have came and got you. You okay? What's wrong? I just ran into Charlie. He was bringing you flowers. Nobody knocked on the door. Did he come by here last night? He came by to see if I was okay. I think he's the one that tried to run me off the road. You think Charlie tried to run you off the road? Yes. Look, he's not who you think he is. What time did Mike leave last night? - Mike? - Yeah. Mike didn't come by here last night. No, no, no. I sent Mike to come check on you. Mike left straight from the hospital to come - check on you. - Honey, he didn't come here. So you were here alone last night by yourself with Charlie? - He came by to see if I was okay. - Why? He knew you weren't here. He brought some food. There was somebody in the backyard. It turned out to be the kids. I called you a bunch of times. - Listen to what you just said. - I sent him home. How did he know? How did he know I wasn't here? Think about that. How did he know? This... This guy is dangerous. Okay? Charlie is very dangerous. Okay. Okay, babe, I believe you. I do. He shows up again, you just... Just call the police, okay? - Just call them. - Okay. Napa Police. Hi. I'd like to get a restraining order. Hey, this is Mike Renfro. Leave your name and number after the beep. Hello? Yes, I'm calling for Mr. Scott Howard. This is he. Mr. Howard, I'm curious if you have an alternate address for Mr. Peck because we've not yet been able to serve the restraining order. - What? - He's not at The Royal Hotel. What are you talking about? Can you double-check, please? I'm sorry, sir. We've gone through all their records, and Mr. Peck has never stayed at The Royal Hotel. - Brian. - Hey, Scott. Tell me, did you hear back from Mike? No one's seen or heard from Mike. What about Charlie Peck, his kids? Did you...? Did you find anything about his kids? I did a lot of digging. There's not much there, but I did manage to find a work cell for a Vanessa Smith. His daughter's name is Cassidy. I told you this. It was. She changed it two years ago. Wait. Ellen. I lost her to cancer two years ago. - Two years ago? - Yeah. Text me the cell, all right? I'll call her from the car. Sure. Hey, let me know if you hear from Mike. - Hello? - Hello. Have I...? Have I reached Cassidy Peck? - Who is this? - My name is Scott Howard, and my wife and I bought the house that you grew up in. I'm calling in regards to your father, Charles Peck. Hello? Damn it. Okay. Hey. What are you doing? I just... I just wanted to see you alone. It seems like we just never get a chance to be alone. You know, just the two of us. Charlie, I think you need to leave. I, uh... I'm sorry, but I screwed up. Something I didn't see coming. But I handled it, and... I just want you to know that from now on, I'm gonna handle everything. You might be hearing some pretty bad things about me. About us. And they're liars. And I want you to know right now that everything I do, I do for you. For us. Um... I think everything's gonna be okay. And, um... Why don't we...? Why don't we talk about this later? I don't think I'm feeling that good. - Oh. - And I'm gonna go upstairs and lay down. - Yeah. - Um... So maybe you should leave the house and let me rest for a while. Well, look at me. I'm filthy. I'll just go clean up. Okay. Phew. What the hell? No! Annie! Annie, stop! Hey! Come here! Annie! Annie! - No! - Who are you calling? - Who? - I already called Scott. The cops are on their way. I think that's the first time that you ever lied to me. Let go! Please, get out! Hey! No! No, please! No! No! Kiss me. Kiss me. What? Hello? Cassidy. - Tell me he's dead. - No. No, look, he's very much alive. Then what do you want? I'm calling because he keeps telling us he's coming to Florida to live with you. - Florida? - Yeah. I live in Maine, as far away as I could get. If my father were to ever show up at my doorstep, I'd kill him. Okay, but why is he telling us that...? Because he's a pathological liar and a monster. He murdered my mother and fixed it to look like suicide. All she did was threaten to file for a divorce and take away his house. It's all about his house. If you're in his way, your life is in danger. Please don't call me again. I love you. We've had this date from the beginning. Hi. You've reached Annie. Leave a message. Annie, listen, it's me. I-I-if Charlie comes by, do not let him in. I... Just do not let him in. Call the police and then call me, okay? Okay? Call me back. Oh, Annie. I'll make you so happy. And when Mama's happy, everybody's happy. Get off of me! Get off of me! Annie? Shh! Oh, no. Annie! Annie. What? This is my house! Annie? Annie? I took care of Scott. Annie. Come out. Open the door. Annie, open the door. Open the door! Annie! Get off of me! Get off of me. No! Don't fight. Don't fight. Oh, I love you. Let go. Let go. Okay, okay. Are you okay? - I'm okay. - Thank God. Oh, God. Oh, I'm so sorry. - I love you. - I love you too. Oh. - Are you okay? - Yeah. Are you? - Are you okay? - Baby, he killed Mike. - He what? - He killed Mike. He's been living under the house the whole time. It's okay. It's okay. Listen, I need you to trust me. We're not dying today. I want you out of my house! Okay, okay. We gotta go. All right. Come with me. Let's go. No! Lights out! Shh. Come on, get your phone. Get your phone. You're not gonna shoot me. You can't shoot me, pussy. You know why? You know why? Because it's not loaded. Check your pocket. Go ahead. You had one left. I got it. Make the call. Make the call. Make it. Annie. 911. Emergency. Please send the police to 6741 Arbor Road. Annie, baby. What is the nature of your emergency? My husband just shot an intruder. Annie. Annie! You don't deserve Foxglove! Go to hell.
