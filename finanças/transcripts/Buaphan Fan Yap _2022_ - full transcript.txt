We'll get a quarter of one baht each! - Is that so? - Yeah. I feel like a cattle waiting to be sold. Look over there. That's Grandma Pri. Is she sleeping or dead? Hey. Why didn't they let her be dead at home? All right. The showing is done. - Yeah. - We'd like to thank our host today. - That's right. - For letting our comedy group be part of the celebration of the discovery of an ancient cannon. - That's right. - It's such an honor. Who else didn't dance yet? Those three. Three? That's four. Not the grey hair one. Why is she here? She's here as undertaker's fav. Photographer's fav? No, undertaker is ready. To give a garland?

Let's call them up. Hey, blue shirt? It's you. Please come over here. She looks shy and cute. Isn't she? She is. Let's ask her some questions. Hello. What's her name? Hello. Hello, my name is Jan-ab. - Jan-ab, born in January on a joyful day. - All J's. She's jolly and juicy. Not at all jealous or jaded. Guys see her and want to jerk… Jerk what? Jerk her heart. I'm here thinking dirty. And she might look like this but she's good at dancing! Music! Stop! Why? I'm gonna kick you out to do something else. Only one move for the whole song? Go back to your seat! Sleep next to my grandma! Go. Who's next? Yellow shirt, please. She's juicy too, this one. - Right this way, please. - Nice. Look at her walk. Very lovely. - Isn't she lovely? - Hello. Lovely and well-mannered. Very true. What is your name? My name is Tao-na. Tao-na. She's cute. The pretty lady. That's true. From the left, she looks like an angel. And the right? A goddess. And the front? A queen. A queen of what? A queen of monkey. If you want a dance with her, she can only move the top. - Why? - When she moves her legs, she needs a lot of space. Is that so? Yesterday it was 10 people. Ten people danced with her? Ten people kicked her out. Why was that? Her move was too much. Gotta be careful. Music! Her first move. What is that? Paying respect. To her teacher? No, a janitor taught her. Okay. Let's see. Here we go. What is this move? Swag for the enemy. So dope. Next one. What's this one? Swag for you. Stop! Why are we stopping? It's too much, they hate her already. Go sit. Is that it? That's it. Go. Sucks. Bitch. Next. Next girl, please. What you've been waiting for. Here she is. Pink shirt is ready. I must say, this one is special. They're waiting for her. Me too. Pink shirt, come this way please. Mom, this is the master I want to learn with. Master Buaphan. - The wrong foundation one? - Yes. What's her move? Her move is an aerobic move. How so? It's an exercise move. Make you strong? This grandma, 90 years old and sick, she's barely alive, complained everyday. - And how's that? - They danced for 3 days. Wow, then she got strong. No, she died. Tell me. How did she die? Wait, where are you going? Come back. Don't pout. Many of you might not know aerobic. - It gives you six pack. - How so? It's moving your core muscle here, gets it working. She will demonstrate. Can we see it? Music! First move. What's this? Up and down. Faster? Step up. Harder! Harder! Stop it! I'm tired. Tired and so what? You wanna know? Shit, she's getting pissed. Dude, don't. Mark my words. If you don't do that 100 times, I will not pay you! Are you bailing? Don't! And what are you gonna do? - Don't get in a fight with her. - What are you scared of? I'm warning you. I will not pay. Don't! You're so small. What are you gonna do? He's insulting women. Oh, yeah. Wrong-foundation, wait. Wrong-foundation. Wrong-foundation, wait, please. Mom! Don't call her that. Her name is Master Buaphan. I see. Hello. My name is Kham. We are from Udonthani. She's the monk's sister. After marrying my father, she moved to the military camp with him. My dad died, so we're moving here to his town. Why are you telling me all this? The thing is, I want to be a soldier like my dad. He told me about you at his village. And that your martial art is second to none. Can I please learn from you? He's got a killer smile. Can you say yes? No. Why not? No reason. There is a reason. She doesn't just teach anyone. Especially men, she hates them. Let's go, bitch. What do we do now? Somebody help me. Help! Somebody help! Anybody? Help! Please don't hurt me. Let me feel you. Hey! Stop right now! Who the fuck are you? It's not your concern. What the hell is this? Leave him. - Leave him. - Why? He can handle them. He's got some moves. You're so great, huh? Kham. Kick his face! Okay. He missed it. This one got it. High jump kick! Thanks. He stole your ideas! You're shameless! Kick his crotch, son! Knee his face! Punch his chin! Knee his chest! Hit his head! High kick slap! Jab his leg… Enough, he's already knocked out. What a waste of time. And who the fuck are you? We are… The Soaring Weasels! Are you thugs lost? You're looking for trouble. No. Wow! Yes! She destroyed him. Attention! As the village chief, I'm calling for everyone to gather at my office at 9:00 a.m. tomorrow. End of announcement. Thank you. Hey! How was that? We let you fight on your own. If we were there, it would be brutal. Let's go. Super! Thank you for saving my life. VILLAGE CHIEF'S OFFICE I received a telegram from the district. The Crazy Sakura gang is nearby. Who the hell are the Crazy Sakura? They are the Japanese who were defeated in the war. They pulled a jailbreak and now robs statues from villages. Why are they after buddha statues? How would I know? That's why they're called crazy. I see. Dad, does it mean they're coming for our statue? Don't worry. Left. Right. Left. Left. Right. Left. Left. Right. Left. Stop. Turn left. Don't forget that we have our Cobra team. Who the hell are they? They're the volunteer police of the village. The government set this up because there are not enough policemen. Oh. Are you sure just the six of you can handle the gang? They need help, sir. My master. We will help you protect our village's sacred statue. Because we are… The Soaring… Enough! Dad, why did you stop us? We were getting to our end pose. How many times did I tell you? You need to stop this nonsense! On your right, sir. That's right. This is life and death. I know it is, Dad. That's why you need us. Unless someone here thinks that we are not good enough. And don't you dare tell me to leave just because we're women. Love it. What year is it now? The leader already said men and women are equal. Women are not just wives, or kitchen slaves, or baby machines. It's time for women to stand up and be brave. Hey, Tub, take her to a shrink sometime. I did, but I couldn't see the shrink. So, who will volunteer to join the Cobra team for the fight? Please raise your hand. Who else? Come on. Please raise your hand to protect our village. I want to help. My son. He's my son. You're the one who saved my daughter from the thugs, right? But the Sakura, they're much more evil than the thugs. Can you handle it? I just got here, but I want to help the Cobra, sir! Determined. Good. That's it then. Dismiss! Dad! What about us? Right turn! What about us? - Sir! - And us? Shit, I can raise my hand all day but no one wants us anyway. This sucks. Wow, and you have to smoke? You don't even know how. Excuse me. Watch this. Damn, a Chinese boat? Give me more. Shit, a plane from the nose? Wow, give me more! Son of a bitch, a submarine? Give me more! Don't know what the hell that is, but give me more. Stop! My lungs can't take it. I'm still stressed, smoking doesn't help at all. Calm down. Here, let me show you my inventions. Can you not? Look. A rigged compass. North will show as south, east will show as west. What's the point of this? You'll get lost. That's the point. You'll find a new route and meet new people. Maybe it's not your thing. I've got more. Look. Binocular glasses. You don't need to carry one. Try mine. How? Shit! Dude! Were you right here? Nope, didn't move. Shit, try them. Is this real? You two didn't move, right? Not even a millimeter. This one is cool! Why don't you sell them? I sold one to one person. He messed up his eyes real bad. Who was dumb enough to buy it? Your dad. Before he turned blind. Not my dad, damn it. But that's not it. I've got more. I believe Thai people can fly. Watch me. How is it? Amazing, right? What? No opinions? Do you really want to know? I guess not. Don't want to feel hurt. If the Cobra team sees this, they will ridicule you. Honestly, if the Sakura shows up tonight, those guys can't handle it. Then Kham might die, right? Poor him, he just got here to die. Tao-na, let's do this. Deu! Yes, sir. You and your men scope this area. Do not let anyone go through. Yes, sir. I'll be with the new guy at the statue. Let's go. Sir, yes, sir! Let's go! New guy, want a drink to hype you up? I brew it myself. Of course. It tastes strange, but good. What do you use? Dead mice, rotten buffalo meat, and a pinch of ashes. Come on. You are so gullible. This is from beans, my family recipe. It's safe. My face. Is that so? Wait, wait. You're in a hurry to help him. Do you have a crush on Kham? Bitch, who said that? I just feel bad for his mom. And doing this will help? Of course it will. Here, ta-da! The world will celebrate my brain one day. A flute? A flute, my ass. So it's a crappy blowgun. What's so special? It's special because you have to suck it to blow. Suck it to blow? Yeah, suck it and it will shoot the dart. But if you blow it, the dart goes right in your mouth. She probably blew it. Hey, new guy, what's wrong? I don't know. My tummy feels weird. Damn, I forgot to tell you. The liquor is also a laxative. Are you sensitive? I have no idea. That's okay. If you have diarrhea, then you are sensitive. Your stomach is weak like you. Shit. The Sakura is here. Bitch, pick a language. Suck it, okay? Don't blow it. Did it hit me? I don't feel anything. They're here. Bua, stop. I'm a fucking puffer fish. Hey. Sounds like they're here. Put out the light and hide! Let's go. Shit. Did you have to fart now? I couldn't hold it. Damn it. Don't bend like that. That makes your asshole open up. Okay. Are they bullets or rotten eggs? Smells horrible! I told you not to bend! They fired at me. But I'm almost out now. What is wrong with you? It's a lot this round. A lot, my ass! Noa, are you okay? Step back, step back, step back. Don't fart in my face. Holy shit, Master! The statue is gone! Goddamn it! This is your punishment! I just helped them! How is that wrong? It's wrong because you are stubborn! You never listen to me. I must whip you until you learn. Ungrateful kid! It hurts. How is it? You know, I will make you learn. Seriously? Does it hurt? How long do we have until he knows? He already knows. Huh? Oh. Don't be surprised. You can't escape me. Here. Does it hurt? Everything failed because of your fart. You ruined everything because you farted! And now, they have our sacred statue! Four Cobra members are dead. And my son is badly injured. Tell me. Are you working for them? Yeah. That's not it. Let's do this. You and your mom… get out my village. Yeah, get out of here. Sir. Please don't banish us. If he did anything wrong, please punish me instead. I'm begging you. Please don't chase us away. I'm begging you. Mom. They are my relatives. Therefore, I'd appreciate if you can spare them some mercy this time. The mercy you spare for them will give you tremendous merit, equivalent to a big offering. Thank you. You sit here like a dumb-ass. It's time to go. Go where? Wow, you are so fast. Have you ever timed how fast you can go? 60 times per 10 seconds. Damn! That's the point. I'm not trained more than anyone else. I'm just faster. I see. There are people who are faster than me. Really? I heard the rumor some can go up to 99 times per 10 seconds. - Who is that? - No idea. Oh? Haven't met them yet. You are unparalleled. I have retrieved the fourth statue. I heard you fought a woman last night. And… was almost defeated. I've never met a woman so strong and fast. I think her name is Buaphan. Buaphan? I'm intrigued to meet her. Ouch. Who said you can stop? If I say nothing, you have to keep hammering. Understand? Okay. Faster! Faster! Cheers! Wow, it's so good to chat with you guys. Thanks, Sister Jae. You always bring treats. We don't want to trouble you. No, no trouble at all. Honestly, all of us look similar. So don't call me sister, just my name. I have to thank you for teaching Kham. Thank you so much. No problem. It's like teaching a dog to sit. You're drunk now. You're calling her son a dog. No worries. I call him that sometimes. And honestly, he's one handsome dog. So handsome, probably from his father. He got nothing from his mom. Can you imagine? He would be so ugly. Bring it down a notch. I know I'm not that pretty, but I have a big heart! How about this? We swear to be friends right now! No need to be polite. It's pretentious. I don't like it! Sure, Jae. That's it. - Jae, you bitch. - Yeah. - You goddamn bitch. - Good. You fucking bitch. Very good. You're an old hag. A fat bitch. An airhead. A filthy ass. You're a disgrace. Hey, let's skip to the oath. We don't drink for the oath. That's nothing. For people like us, we shed some blood. Here, I'll show you. See? I'm fine. Of course you're fine, you cut my arm! But why are you bleeding from your mouth? I bit my tongue. At least it's not deep, just a bit of blood. Probably hit the artery. Is your blood pressure high? Why do you ask? Of course it is high! It's going to go higher. Don't panic, it will come down. Finally I can relax. Don't relax. The blood pressure will go low and you'll die. Are you fainting? Finally I can relax. Or you will die. Bitch, stop. I'm literally running out of blood. Can you patch me up? Where are you going? Going home! You're just pranking me. You've never taught me a single thing! I've been hammering for a week now. My hands hurt so much. I wanted to be a soldier like my dad. Not this blacksmith nonsense. I've been doing this since I was 14. Hammering everyday for eight hours for the past 26 years. Yes, it's boring and tiring and everyone laughs at it. Why make these knives when everyone uses a gun? But what do you want me to do? This is my family's work. My own father thinks this is the best a girl can do. Do you think I want to do this blacksmith nonsense too? But you know what? I'm a good fighter because of this nonsense. If you want to leave, then leave. Leave! I'm so sorry, Master. - Hey! - Hey! What's up? Where's your kid, old hag? Don't call me that. I remember you thugs. It's you. You're too scared to fight Buaphan. So you're coming after my son instead. Yes! Where is he? Or I'll smack you. Then I'll smack you. You don't know what I can do. Have you seen this move? This asshole keeps blocking me. Hey! What did you do? Here he is. There. Mom! Where did you aim? I saw a wasp's nest last night. So smart. Shit! Mom. Let's go! Where did they go? They've gone, Mom. Check again. Are they gone? They are. Come on down, Mom. These fucking thugs are cowards. They must have been stung very badly. - Shit! - What? Mom… you got stung pretty bad too. I'm not allergic to wasps. Never. I'm allergic to seafood, I told you. I'm serious. Where did I get stung? I'm sorry. Is there more? Mom. Where? Tell me. Is that necessary? I know I just got here, but I want to help the Cobra team. Noa! The sacred statue is gone! You ruined it. You ruined everything! If he did anything wrong, please punish me instead. I'm begging you. Mom! Hey there. Master, you don't need to stop me. Let me drink my hurt away. I'm not here to stop you. I'm here to drink with you. Master. Listen. I can't even handle three lousy thugs. And I can't take care of my mom. You get me, dude? Am I your master or am I your friend? I mean, you don't look that old. I won't call you master anymore then. Yeah. Whatever. What, bro? We're bros now? You and your mom are the same when drunk. But you're way luckier than me. How so? Your mom. She supports you in everything. Whatever your dream is, she's there to help. Sucking at something but still having someone by your side is better than being great at something but no one to care about it. Don't think of it that way. You're still lucky. How? You still have me by your side. Well… I think I need to get more liquor. We're out. Sorry. I'll be right back. Kham. Why are you hugging me? Let go. Do you know that… I liked you the moment I saw you? And you like me too, right? Kham, you're drunk and talking nonsense. I'm drunk but I know what I'm saying. It's from my heart. - Let me go, Kham. - No. Let me go, or I'll… You will what? I will… Say it again. I will kick you and… Stop doing that! Let me finish! How did I get home? You wanted to change places last night. Change places? Yeah. Let's go home. You've had enough? No. There's mosquitos here. I have a net at home. Let's go. And… not just change places. We changed positions too. Change positions? Yup. You know? You're so soft and you smell like Tiger balm, like my mom. And I'm so happy I got to be your first. And you are also my first. I'm screwed! Let me go, Kham. Let me hug you a bit more, please. - No, let me go. - No. - Let me go. - No. My dad might see us. Your dad? He's not up yet. Bua! That's not mine. This is not mine too. Bua! What's with the yelling, Dad? How can I not? Where were you last night? I didn't go anywhere. I was here in my room. Liar! Even if I'm blind, I can tell you weren't home all night. Well, I was at Tao-na's house. Wait. I sense something. Don't tell me… You got drunk? I can smell the stench in here. No man will make you his wife if you behave this way. You'll be an old spinster. Holy shit! Strange. Okay, Dad. I get it. I won't drink anymore. Good. You're acting strange today. Normally you would argue. Yes, Dad. You gave up easily. That's suspicious. Suspicious of what? There's nothing. Don't tell me… You got into another fight? Shit! Oh, my God! What just fell on my shoulder? It's a gecko, Dad. It's just a gecko. I was a soldier in charge of a big cannon previously! I fought the Jap… It went inside your shirt! Shit! It bit my nipple! Slow down. Don't tell anyone this, understand? Of course. But now your dad will let you off now. Why? Because… I made you my wife. And we'll have a bunch of kids. No! I don't want a husband! I also don't want people to say that I date a kid! Go on, go. What time do we meet tonight? No, no meeting tonight. But I want to meet you. Oh, don't tell me. You got me and now you're going to dump me? How sassy of you. You are so cocky. Go. See you tonight, wifey. Help! Get out! Let go of my nipple. Stupid gecko! Damn. I lost my nipple virginity to a gecko. There, look now. Your face will be youthful. Is this horse or goat placenta? Actually from a dog. Bitch. What is it actually? I'm kidding. This is my own herbal formula. Your skin will be so pretty. But why do you want to be pretty now? I don't. I just want to test your stuff, that's all. Hello. Holy mother of god! Hey, it's me, Jae. Remember? Sister Jae, your face is not healed yet? It is healed. It is not. I said it is. It's 50% healed. My skin is sensitive on this side, so it's slow to heal. But this side it's tough, so it's fast to heal. Okay. And what are you doing here? I got you some food. You made us food? Come and sit down. Yeah, sit down. And why are you still standing up? His eyes are up there. Yeah. Sit down. Thank you. And what's up with you moving around? Jae, does your son want a wife? He does. He asked me last night what I would say if he wants to marry someone. Is that true? That's true. What? And I must tell you, it's someone not far away. She's around here. Someone around here. Who is that? And it's someone nobody expects. Damn. Someone around here and unexpected. Oh. It's a surprise. Let me make a wild guess. Go ahead. It's the monk. Someone is badmouthing me. Bitch. You're too much. Don't make me laugh. Half of my face still hurts. Ouch. Kham. Know your place. Don't. Do you want to avenge them? Someone saw those thugs that attacked your mom. They were near the train graveyard over there. If you want to get back at them, we will take you there. I don't smell Tiger balm. It's 10:00 p.m. now. Where the hell is he? Do you think he dumped me already? Who's mumbling out there? Why aren't you sleeping? It's me, Dad. Bua? Why are you still up? I will soon. Well, don't forget to turn off the light. Hurts my eyes. Oh. Okay. You scared me. - Jae. - Yeah? Did Kham disappear last night? Yeah. He probably snuck out to see a girl. Unlikely. He did. - Is that so? - Yeah. When? Last night or the night before? Both nights. Both nights? I don't think so. Think about it. Was it last night or the night before? Think carefully. Which night was it? Which night? I'm not sure anymore. You're pressing her too much. Well, why do we care how many nights? I wanna know more who the girl is. Same. Getting such a handsome and fit man. And a good guy like Kham. I'm jealous of her, right, Jae? Hey, don't be jealous of her. Well… I mean… I mean, we swore we don't want men… And if Khams happen to find a nice woman… then we should be happy for him. That… bitch. You calling me bitch? No. I'm calling that woman bitch. I've been eyeing him for so long and she took him just like that? Sister Jae, she must be a bad person. He went to see her for two nights. Slut! Bitch! Cunt! Shameful! Wow, that's a lot of curse words. I agree! Do you agree? She's such a bitch. This sucks. I'm going to curse this woman. I'm here to ask for blessing, sir. Amen. I wish the woman finds trouble. I wish I get help with my trouble. I wish her business goes bankrupt. I wish my business blooms. I wish she gets ringworm! I wish my face stays pretty. I wish she gets really sick. I wish for my good health. I wish she perishes! I wish whoever curses me perishes first. - Amen. - Amen. Why does that feel weird? So the girl Kham likes… She must be someone like… Buaphan? Sister Jae! Sister Jae! Something happened. Where's his mom? There she is. Kham! Kham! What happened to you? What happened? Kham! What's wrong? What happened, Noa? Deu, Kham, and I were planning to avenge those thugs. The ones who attacked Neangnoi and Kham's mom. Then we accidentally found the missing statue. This is our sacred statue, right? I know what I'm doing! I've translated from the map you gave me. Don't blame me, blame your fucking map. It's not just that. Those thugs work for the Crazy Sakura. And what's this? Why didn't you find my stuff? And you cost me my men! You think I stole your stuff? You hid them yourself and you're too dumb to find it! And now you're blaming us! We're done! We no longer work for you! You go find your own stuff. You're just scum who lost the war. Shit. After they turned on themselves. Let's run. Each of us ran in a different direction. But Kham got unlucky. He ran into them and they shot him. Following the gunshot sound, I found Kham unconscious. Deu! I found Kham! It's fortunate that we found him in the water in the mangrove. But it's strange. The bullet just grazed his shoulder. But he won't wake up. Oh, no. Kham, don't do this. Wake up and talk to me. Kham! Kham, are you awake? Kham is awake! He's awake! It's okay, Son. What happened to me? Kham? Don't you remember anything? I… Don't tell me you lost your memory. Father! I got my memory, sir. I was shot by the Sakura. I was so worried. And this is my mom. It's me, Son. And this is… Jan-ab. And this is… Tao-na. This is… Neangnoi. That's right. And this… Master Buaphan! Some people get shot through their bodies. The bullet goes through and through. If this was someone else, he would have perished. But here you got shot and the water saved you. You are so blessed, son. Amen. - Thank you. - Okay, Son. I'm okay, Mom. Amen. The doctor told me to take you out somewhere nice. So you'll recover well. Let's have some rice porridge. I made it with love. Open wide. Oh. It's still hot. Let me blow it for you. Open wide. Oh. I have to tell you, it looks really good. How about you eat it yourself then? Just kidding. I made it just for you, not for me. They said men like funny women. So I'm trying to be funny. When, in fact, I am the pretty one. Open wide. Not hot anymore. My mom said you're looking for me? I… It's good to see you. Neangnoi got this western soap from Bangkok. She said you can use it on your face and your body. So I want you to have it. What did you do that for? I have an important thing to ask you. You didn't show up as promised the other night because of the thugs? Wait. The other night… what did I promise? Don't tell me you remember everything, except that we… We… We? The night before the night before. There is the night before the night before? And what is that? "We didn't just change places, we changed positions too." Huh? Remember it? Anything? Remember… what? "I'm glad that I'm your first, and you are my first too." "You got me and now you're going to dump me?" "How sassy of you." "See you tonight, wifey." Are you feeling well? What are you doing, Master? - Let me go. - What? - Kham. - Let me go! Whoa. What the hell? Where could she have gone? She's either at the smithy or at home. I think so. There she is What's wrong? Damn. What are you going to do now? Let's get physical. It's not right fighting Neangnoi, you know? No, I'm gonna fight you! You're hammering the metal and also the young man? And you said you don't want men! What a hypocrite. Hey, you made her sad. What are you going to do now? "Memory loss can come from a blunt force to the head. A way to repair is to repeat the blunt force and the memory may come back. But the ritual is only to be done at noon to be effective." I think this is it. But we have to be stealthy. He cannot know it's us. So stealthy… and so over the top. Hey. Are you sure Kham and Neangnoi will come here at noon? It's only 60 seconds away. Goddamn it. Why are you being so loud? I told you I overheard them. Wow, your outfit is shit. There he comes. - He's coming! - He's coming. What do we do? Help me get this on, quick! Off I go. Neangnoi is not here yet? Huh? What was that? Will this work? Kham? Shit, that's Neangnoi! In position! Jan, move to the left. What? - To the right a bit. - Where? - Hey. - Which way? Let's abort! Run! Wait up! Kham? What's wrong? Please don't die. You're still alive. What happened? Neangnoi. Some asshole kicked me out of nowhere. And then I felt something hit me in the head. Oh no. Are you hurt? Let's take that statue to the village chief's house. Just in case the Sakura come back. Huh? Shit! Why are you so clueless and clumsy? Huh? Huh? So the Japanese hid the gold in Buddha statues and left them in nine villages. That's right. And after the war ended, they came back and robbed us. But they took the wrong statue. If they know this is here, they'll surely come back. So, Dad, let me execute my plan. You barely survived the last time. Are you going to fight them again? Dad, I will attack them from my hideout. I will not miss this time. Honestly, I didn't want to help her retrieve a man. And I thought our friend is a girl boss, a leader. Bullshit. She wants a man like everyone else. Yeah, that's an affront to our Soaring Weasels. I'm so disappointed in her. I feel like she lied to me. Yeah. If I had known, I would have got married at 18. And I wouldn't be the clown of the village. This is all bullshit. Hey. I'm… just here to ask if I can crash at your place for a few days. I'm sorry for disappointing you guys. And for making you feel like I lied to you. I'm sorry that I'm just an ordinary woman. Bua. Bua. You and your mouth. You started it, bitch. I've never thought that I'd ever want a man, you know. But you know what? That morning when I woke up I felt like the happiest person in the world. I thought about things, how my life and Kham's will be. How would Jae feel about her son marrying an older woman? What will the villagers say? Would they be jealous of me? Can I have kids with him like a normal woman? Will it be a boy or a girl? I thought so much of everything. And then Kham turned out like this. I think having no one is bad. But having someone and then one day losing him is way worse. Thank both of you so much for listening to me blabbering. No one ever understands me in this village like the two of you. What? Look, I'm officially one of the Cobra team now. I rushed here to tell you before I go get them again. - Get them again? - Yes. We are going to set a trap for the Crazy Sakura. The village chief even said if this succeeds, if we can protect the gold statue, he will throw us a big celebration as heroes. Are you ready? It's dangerous. Kham. I've been looking for you. What is it? I was worried about you so I brought you this. It's my father's protective amulet. Hey, Master! Let's move it. Now. Deu! Deu! Deu! Deu! Deu! We're never going to find her knives. Don't give up just yet. I'll take care of it. Is this the one? This is silver. No. Is this the one? This is gold. No. This? No. This? Why are you bringing me axes? Are you a fucking forest spirit? I can't take it anymore. Bitch! I'm the one who can't take it anymore. You just stand there and cry. Your throat just hurts. I'm fucking diving here with stones piercing my feet. You asshole. Here! Here! We should hide the statue in the mountain, don't you think? Good idea. What is it? - Noa! - Hey! - Noa! - Noa! Brother! - Noa! - Brother! Get the doctor! Yes, sir. How are you? What happened? I was wrong. Those men were devils. Dad. Deu is dead. Huh? Due is dead? And Kham? What happened to him? Say it! Say it! Anything? Sir. No matter what we do, he wouldn't say anything. All we know is Buaphan is his master. I want to meet your master. The Crazy Sakura is coming. Go on. Be careful. Follow them. Watch out as you go. I won't listen to him anymore. I need to get the statue no matter what. Father, what should I do? Kham was captured and I want to help the man I love. But come to think of it, he has no memory of me. He doesn't love me anymore. You understand me, Father? What should I do? How about you follow your heart? Even if we are bad friends who disappointed you, we know you more than anyone. I know you. You never give up no matter what life throws at you. Go and help the man you love. But I threw my knives in the river. Tada! What? How did you get it? Bitch, I found it! This is the one, right? No, no. She has two, not one. We have to find one at a time, don't we? You're a dumb-ass. Thank you so much. It's nothing. It's nothing for you. But I worked like a dog. Thanks. Hey, where are you going? You have to talk to someone first. He's over there. Dad. You're going to help the man you love? Who told you that? Those two. And you know that you can't stop me. I'm not here to stop you. I'm blind and I can't speak well. I see you guys talk this way so I want to try it. I hope you can listen this way. Even though I'm blind, I can see how great you are. And that makes me worry that you might get hurt. I was a useless husband who made his wife miserable until she died. I don't want to be a useless father who let you get hurt. But believe me, I'm proud that you are second to none. It's time for you to show everyone what I'm proud of, my daughter. What are you trying to tell me? Oh? What did you get from what I did? I need to poop. These few days I've been constipated. No matter how hard I pushed, it never came out. My stomach is full of gas. But either way, I love to poop. Goddamn! What did they teach me? Where are those two? Dad. I know what you're trying to say. Okay. Are you going to save Kham? I'm coming with you. I can't fight but I can help. I was a nurse. No, you don't have to. I'm coming. I'm going to help my son. Stay. The two of us are staying here. He's not your son, is he? I'm going. I'm going to save my son. Bua. Come here. Come here. Come back here. I'm going. Bua. I'm going. Let me go. Fine. I won't be able to walk now. Bua. Go and save Kham for me. Take your feet off my ingrown nail. Your tolerance is high. Your master must be proud. Boss. Saito and his two men can't be found. This is not good. What? Ouch. Master. I'm here with an offer. Let's go hide it in the cave behind the village. If you win, I will let your student go and never come back to this village. But what do I get if I win? You get to prove yourself. Don't you wanna know who's the best? Okay. Stop! We are the Weasels! What are you doing? I forgot it's her first day. Let's skip the routine. Leave the people of our village alone! Are all the women here crazy? You can shoot all day but you can't touch this. Oh, he can. Sister Jae! Sister Jae! Sister Jae! Jae, breathe, okay? Sister Jae! He took the statue! - Sister Jae! - Jae! I know you've never sutured a wound, right? But I know you can do it. Get the alcohol. Alcohol. Sister Jae. Good. - Get the scalpel. - Huh? Get the scalpel. - Cut the opening. - Huh? Open the wound. Do it! Sister Jae. Do it again! I think it's too big. But that's okay. - Get the forceps. - Forceps. Forceps. Get the damn bullet out. Sister Jae. Is it out? It's too deep, sis. I respect your skill. But you're just a woman and this is it. The Thousand Hands of Guanyin? Yes. It's the fastest move there is. Can you do it? I can, but I don't want to. Whoever attempts it will lose their hands forever. The Thousand Hands of Guanyin. Die! It's out! Get the thread. Am I bleeding a lot? Thread. Suture it together. I will pass out now but I will not die. Do it. Don't be scared. Don't be afraid. Kham is the apple of my eye. Stop! We're done. That's goddamn fast. Drop the gun, idiot! You're embarrassing me. I'm defeated. You can take him. Kham! Mom! Are you okay? I'm okay, Mom. But what happened to you? Don't worry about it, it's far from my heart. Don't worry about your mom yet, worry about the statue. The Crazy Sakura Gang! He took the statue and left on a motorbike! The chief said if this succeeds, he will throw us a big celebration as heroes. I must get the statue back. Quick! - Come on! - Come here! Faster. We're losing him. Send me up. Seriously? Seriously. You're done for, scumbag! Bitch, why are you yelling? He can hear you! Bua! Bua! Don't panic. Pull the left string and the backup wings will deploy. - Shit, I said the wrong thing. - What? Bua! What happened? She got up! Bua. When did he go? Yes! Are you okay? Careful. My son. Are you okay? I'm okay. Welcome ladies and gentlemen, to the celebration of the hero who has safeguarded our gold. You may not know who the person is. The ceremony is going to start soon. Are you sure this will work? It's so cumbersome. Of course it works. After they're done, it's your turn to put on a show. Look at it, kids. I already set the timer. When it beeps, that's when you go up. The next item is for our village chief to give the medal of bravery to the hero of Leub Lom Lek village. Kham! This is the time for our hero to give a speech. Please. First of all, I'd like to tell my mother. I did it, Mom! My son. He's my son. And another person that I must thank… Without her, I wouldn't be here. Master Buaphan. My friend. That's my friend. Your kid is good. My friend. And besides thanking her, I have something to tell her and everyone here… Wifey, I love you so much. What? Shit, he said it. That means he got his memory back! Bua, you got your man back. I'm so confused. When did this happen? When did it start? Right, mother? I'm so confused too. Who's your mother? Leave me alone. What? I'm not your wife. Oh. Don't tell me… You lost your memory? Wow, what a twist of fate. What is going on? Don't you remember? Bua? Come on. I don't know! Hey. Wifey, where are you going? Kham! Bua! When was this? Must be the day with gecko. What gecko? I heard the noise at home. Wifey, don't leave yet. Why are you acting this way? We had sex. Don't you remember that night? What night was it? And why are you touching me? You're so disrespectful! Don't leave yet, wifey. Let's talk first. - No! Let me go! - No! - What is wrong with you? - No. How did it turn out this way? Wifey, wait for me. Wifey! I'm so confused. If my friend and my kid did… What should I do? I understand, mother. Where's your own mom? Leave me alone, will you? I'm stressed. What do you think I should do? Dude, It's beeping! Where do I turn if off? I forgot to make a turn off button. What? Son of a bitch.
