[music playing] $1.50 cover charge plus tickets. You got nothing smaller? No. I can't break $100. Well, how much is a ticket? It's $0.25. Well, then give me, what, 400 tickets. What, are you crazy? I close this place in an hour. You gonna dance 400 dances in an hour? Hey, I'm a fast dancer, all right? It's your money. Hey, old man, do yourself a favor, huh? Buy yourself something real nice, OK? Hey, thanks. Maybe I'll keep the place open another hour for you. No, back off. We're gonna do it like this. Wow, a whole roll. I usually just get one ticket. You're the only one I wanted to dance with. And you're worth the whole roll. What's your name? Lisa. You live around here, huh? Yeah. And you? No. No. I'm from out of town. I'm staying at the Hilton. I took a cab over. How about-- ah, never mind. Why here? Kathy said this is where the action is. It's 1 o'clock in the morning, and I don't want to spend the night alone. For a ticket, all you get is a dance. You know, don't take this the wrong way, but you're beautiful. And I would love to, uh-- to spend the evening with you. Maybe just talk, sleep, sleep, talk. And then maybe you can take me to Disneyland in the morning. I can't. I have to work tomorrow. Call in sick, OK? Captain? You need to listen to this. Don't worry about the prints. It's been dusted. It's clean. LISA (ON TAPE): What are you doing? Don't you want to sleep with me? Do you want to sleep with me? Yes. Are you good in bed? Yes. I bet you are. How many guys you bring in here tonight, huh? I don't-- Know? No, I swear. I brought you here because I liked you. Yeah. I like you too, Lisa. But you're going to die tonight. No, please. Beg me to kill you, Lisa. Please. Please don't kill me. Beg me to kill you, Lisa. Please, I beg you. I have a three-year-old daughter. I left her with my mother. I just got this job. If you beg me to kill you good, Lisa, I might change my mind. LISA (ON TAPE): You're not lying to me? You'll let me go if I beg you? MAN (ON TAPE): I'm not lying to you. LISA (ON TAPE): Please kill me. I want you to kill me. Would you like your throat slit? Huh, Lisa? Huh? Yes, I would. [screaming] Did you see the stop sign that you ran? I followed you through two of them. You're driving past the white line and into the intersection. You're supposed to stop behind the white line. So I'm giving you a ticket for running a stop sign, OK? Karen. Karen, the captain's on the radio. He wants to talk to you. OK. Well, it's just a warning this time. But next time drive more carefully, all right? [honking] Must have been some kind of mistake that they're letting trash like you out of jail. Man, they'll let anybody out of here, as if there isn't enough scum on the street already. Oh, Karen. I'm glad you're here. I want you to say hello to your new partner, Jamie. Nice to meet you. And you know the DA, Mr. Williams. Detective Radar. Have a seat. How are you doing? Great. Yesterday I wrote 12 tickets. I'm 105 over quota, and it's not even 3 o'clock yet. Last week I got a purse snatcher, but he let him go because he didn't want me in the courtroom. OK. OK, just cut it out, Karen. KAREN: What's going on here? Did I make another mistake? Did I write the mayor's nephew another ticket? No. I called you in to let you know Michael Moranzo is a free man. What? I thought he got 20 years. Oh, he didn't kill Sharon Washington. See, last night, while Mr. Moranzo was in a bunk in his cell, another duplicate murder was committed. According to the DA here, the best we can get Moranzo on now is possession of a weapon. And since he's already spent three months in jail, he's out on parole. I want this son of a bitch, Karen. I want you to go undercover with Jamie. I want you to hang out at the Cover Girl Club. Golly, Captain. I don't know. I-- I've kind of grown accustomed to strip searches and writing tickets. Damn it, Karen. Get serious. Don't get sarcastic with me. I'm giving you a chance to get on the street where you belong. Do you want it or not? When do I start? Tonight. And one more thing, Karen. You go by the book on this. You report to me every day. You screw up on this, you're out of a job. Did you free a pigeon before you killed her? Yeah, I did. Because it's really important to me. Yeah. What's the matter with you? Come on, huh? She had a three-year-old daughter, Michael. Oh, she told you, huh? Yeah, she did. She was probably lying. Fucking bitches will say anything to make you go easy on them. It was in the fucking paper, Michael. It was in the fucking paper, huh? What are you doing reading the paper, huh? What's the matter with you, reading the paper, huh? I told you never to do that. Did I tell you never to do that? Huh? What'd I tell you? Look at me! Hey, you know what I'm gonna do? I want you to feel better, OK? See this pigeon, huh? This is my baby. I love this pigeon. I'm gonna free this pigeon, huh? Does that make you feel better, huh? Here. Hey, you're my blood. You're my cousin. I'd do the same for you. No more killing, huh, Michael? I swear on my mother's grave, no more. And don't go to any more of those dime-a-dance places, all right? Let me fix you up. Let me fix you up with a beautiful girl, OK? Yeah, you do that. You've always been good with the women, huh? Why do you keep bugging me, lady? I've told the police everything. Everything? Yes, everything. I want you to look at the mug books again. I'm not looking at your books. I've looked at them before. I told you, I've never seen the guy. Your artist drew a sketch of him. Give me a break, lady. OK, fine. We'll see you tonight. We're going to come here and work as dancers. Bullshit. You know, enough is enough. I've got a business to run here. And I don't hire cops. No, but you hired a 15-year-old to serve drinks to your customers and service you in your back room. We can shut you down in a minute, pal. So what's it going to be? -Hey. -Hey, Anthony. How you doing? -All right, Bill. How you doing? Michael, it's good to see you. Good to see you. Michael, this my girlfriend, Musho. Hi, Michael. It's nice to meet you. I've heard a lot about you. Pleasure. I'm going to go check the barbecue, honey. OK. What are you guys drinking? Anything? What are you drinking? Scotch. That's good. All right, give me a light beer. Light beer? Scotch and light beer. Jackie, can you get me a scotch and a light beer, please? How about a burger, huh? I stopped by at your place last night, but you weren't in. Yeah, I know. I had something I had to take care of. Are you gonna be in tonight? Hey, come on. Not in front of Bill. I don't want him getting suspicious. I don't want to blow this bank deal, all right? We'll get together maybe tomorrow or the next day, OK? Promise? Sure, I promise. See ya. All right, guys. Here we go. Here's the plan. On Thursday morning at 10 o'clock, Zyda Construction Company is delivering about $400,000 to the bank by armored truck. Let me ask you something. How do you know that? How do I know that? On Wednesday afternoons, Zyda Construction Company pays their employees a total of about $400,000. On Thursday afternoons, all the wives rush into the bank to cash their husbands' checks. That means on Thursday morning, they've got to fill the vaults. Now, wouldn't that make sense if you owned a bank? I don't know. I never owned a bank. But all I'm saying is, if I go in that bank, I better walk out of there with 400,000, OK? 400,000 guaranteed. And who knows, we might get lucky and hit a bonus. Maybe a mil, maybe two. Here, I got you some food. No, I don't want it. Come on, what's wrong with it? I'm not hungry. Come on. You need something to eat. Listen, I'm not hungry, all right? Take it easy, huh? Come on. Aw, man. Hey, Michael, come on, where are you going? The party just started. Come on. We're having fun, man. And what are you asking him all those questions for in there, huh? Don't you know we need him more than he needs us? Come on, he could find two guys anywhere to pull this damn job. I don't trust him, man. He's a god damn druggie who doesn't know what he's talking about, OK? Oh, come on, he knows what he's talking about, Michael. Yeah? How? -Yeah, how? -Yeah. How? Trust me for once. Just trust me, OK? I don't think the guy's that smart, man. He could never possibly set up the bank and the construction company at the same time, OK? Oh, come on. Come on, just-- you want to know? -Yeah, I want to know. -You want to know? -Yeah. -OK. That Musho, all right? Musho, his old lady, she set the whole damn thing up. She set it up, right? -Yeah, she set it up, right. -Mm-hmm? Uh-huh. How many more people know about this? How many more? Come on, Mikey. No, how many more people know about this? Just her and us. You're out of your fucking mind, OK? She's a fucking broad. That little cunt probably told 15 other broads over lunch. Bullshit, not Musho. -Don't give me bullshit. -Bullshit. OK? She prob-- she's a fucking bullshit cunt. She's a nothing, man. Hey, Michael, OK, she didn't say nothing. Trust her. Trust me, will you? Listen, you count me the fuck out of this because I'm not going back to fucking jail, OK? Come on, Michael. No, no, no, Michael, shit. Michael, come on. [chatter] Is this the guy? Yeah, that's him. Oh, god. Please don't let it be me. He smells so bad. There you go. It's four, five, 10. Enjoy yourself. Can I help you? All of it? All the way, big guy. All right. Here you go. Have a nice time, buddy. Thank you. So, this isn't exactly my idea of the first night on the job. Should have seen my first assignment. It was at a bakery. We ran a stakeout for a drug bust. Six months. Never did catch the guys, and I gained 10 pounds. There he is. Over there. This is it. Let's get to work. So, have you worked here long? No. Not long. I just moved here from New York. I came here to become an actress. I mean, I am an actress. I have an agent, and I just went out on a commercial audition yesterday. It was good. I had a good time. You look good. Hey, Sandy, you got a phone call. Thanks. Excuse me. Hey, wait a minute. How about you? You got a ticket? Yeah. So, is this your first time here? Why do you ask? Because I haven't seen you before. It's my first time. Do you remember everyone who comes in here? No. I just noticed you. I was hoping you'd ask me to dance. Really? Yeah. How about you and I get something to eat later on? Well, I have to get home by 2:00. You know, I should go home and get some sleep. Yeah. How about tomorrow for breakfast? OK. Good. Would you like some more coffee? Yes, please. Uh, excuse me, I still didn't get my OJ. How long did you work as a waitress? Oh, for three years while I was in college. You knew that because I said OJ, right? From the way you were looking around, I figured you were either a waitress or a cop. All right, you got your coffee, you got your donuts. Let's go. Hey, relax, all right? Michael will be here any minute. Just relax. Michael. Screw Michael. Let's do it. He's not going to show. -Bullshit, all right. Just relax. And what about her, huh? -What about her? She's not going to freeze up and take off without us, is she? -No, she's not. -Huh? -No? No? No? No. OK. She drive a stick, huh? What difference does it make? It's an automatic. Let's do it. Do you have to be someplace? No, why do you ask? This is the third time you've looked at your watch in five minutes. How's your breakfast? It's OK. You know, look. There is something important I have to do, OK? So how about I catch up to you later, hm? You see, god damn it? I told you he'd show up. Come on, let's bring it on home. Let's go. These are our plain checks. You get 1,000 of them when you open your account for free. If you like something with a little more of a feminine touch, there's a slight extra charge on these. And you'll be making that payment every month for the next four years. I can make that payment. That's not that much money. Thank you. You have a nice day. Hello. Hi. I'd like to have $50. OK. Mrs. Cantalupo, one moment. Yeah, OK. Thank you. OK. There's that. That's 20, 40, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, and 50. Thank you very much. Thank you. Bye bye. You can't fit there. Get out! You. Hit the floor. All right, listen up! All right, listen up. This is a hold up. Everyone on the floor. You, get to work. Hey, what the hell is this? Down on the floor. Touch that fucking button, I'll kill you. Get your hands up. Let's go! Get on the floor, god damn it. You listen to me real careful, OK? You take the money out of that drawer, and you take the rest of it and you put it right here. Let's go. You fucking asshole. You can't fit in here. You're hitting my car. Would you get out? I gotta move, all right? Where's the rest of it? That's it. That's it? How much is there? About 5,000. 5,000? You're gonna die, bitch. There's 400,000 in this bank someplace, and you better get it. Let's go. It's in the safe. Open the safe. Only the manager has the-- Where's the manager? Come on, let's go. Where is he? He's across the street at the deli, having lunch. Having lunch? It's only 10 o'clock in the morning. Let's go. Open it, or you're dead. What are we going to do now? We're not going anywhere without the money. Guys, we gotta get out of here. Someone's gotta call the cops. She's right. She's telling the truth. There's no manager here. There's no manager? There's no manager. Let's go. We gotta get. Fuck you, junkie. [gunshot] [gunshot] Go! Go! [gunfire] 5,000. Look at this. Five fucking thousand. It's because you brought a [inaudible] in to do a fucking man's job. Hey, it was all set up, Mikey. Set up, my ass. Shit. OK. Let's just take it easy, OK? Let's just take it easy. Let me think about it. When do you go back to work? I'm not going back to work. Hey, come on, Michael. Leave her alone, huh? You are going to go back to work, all right? And you're going to find out if they're going to change their payroll day. Hey, Michael, I think we should lay off of this. You lay off, OK? I came that fucking close to getting myself $400,000. Getting yourself 400,000? What about us? This is for us. This is for us. We came that close, OK? Don't you want to do it for Bill, huh? Let's get those son of a bitches, huh? Don't you want to get them, huh? Then we can blow this town forever, huh? You gonna do that for me, huh? Are you, huh? Yes. Yes. Good, good. OK. Now let's split the five grand, OK? Oh, yes, sir. Yes, sir. Sir, I'll get right on that. Yes, sir. I understand, sir. I-- son of a bitch hung up on me. I'm a joke. The whole police department is a god damn joke, Karen. People got shot out there, and not one squad car showed up. I tried to call. How? I told you how. I'd like to hear that again. I ran to a payphone booth, but it was out of order. And I had to get back to the bank, so I told this man to call the cops and tell them that there was a bank robbery in progress. Guess what, the man never called, Karen. He probably thought you were some kind of a lunatic. Karen, I want you to go home. Go home and stay home. Hi, Mom. Hi. I'm making some tea. Do you want some? No, thanks. What's the matter? Nothing. Don't say nothing. Something happened today. No, really. nothing happened. I'm all right. I'm going to go upstairs and take a shower, OK? OK. [action sequence on television] You haven't touched your dinner. I will. If you want something else, I'll fix it for you. No, it's fine. [screaming on tv] Is it me? Mama, what are you talking about? If it's me that's bothering you, I'll move out. Why do you say such a thing? It's not you. I'm not going to cook dinner anymore. You're the one that's upset at me because I didn't make it home to dinner last night, right? Well, that. And the fact I don't like my daughter dressing up like a tramp and going out with weirdos. It's my job, mom. Well, I'm just saying that before you know it, you'll be 40, and all you'll have is a job. And no husband and no kids. And where's your husband? Mom, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that to you. No, no, no, no. I deserved it. I just don't want to see you end up alone. I want to hold your children before I die. Oh, I wish you wouldn't talk like that. You didn't have anything to eat. Can I fix you something before you go to work? OK. That'd be nice. Thanks. Jeez. Captain! Captain! What the hell are you doing here? What are you doing dressed in those clothes? I want to go to the Cover Girl tonight. I already pulled Jamie off the case, and you don't work for the police department anymore. Now, wait a minute. I may not have done exactly what you'd like me to do at the bank, but I did risk my life to catch those guys. Karen, why is it every time you risk your life, seven other guys get wasted, huh? Come on, I got the commission breathing down my neck here. Look, you know I really like you. Do me a favor. Go home for now. And what about Michael? He's gonna hit the bank again. The bank has two security offices of its own. Besides which, Michael and his gang, they're the problems of the FBI now. But I know they're still here. I know they are. They don't give up that easily. Karen, go home. Take off the blond wig and go home. And that way if we need your help, we know where we can find you. Yeah, well, don't-- don't be too sure I'll be there. How's it going? Want to play some pool? Yeah, why not? We shoot for money. Money? How much money? $20 a game. What's the matter? Your mommy didn't give you your allowance today? My mommy, huh? I like that. I break. [music playing] OK, pal. $800. Yow! I got a bullseye, a one, and a two. Babe, hey, you're getting good at this, huh? Practice makes perfect. Hey, Michael, you got blood all over your shirt. Are you all right? What happened. I'm OK. You're OK? Yeah. Yeah, I'm OK. You want a beer? Yeah. Here. Hey, Musho, get us a couple of beers, OK? You sleeping with her? Yeah, yeah. But it's nothing serious. Just so she'll be loyal. That's it. Loyal? Huh? Did you say loyal? It's just-- they don't have a loyal bone in their bodies. Her old man's not even cold in the grave. You and I are loyal. What'd you tell her about us? About what? Don't play done with me, OK? I know you. After you're done screwing them, you like to hold onto them and tell them shit. Come on, I do not. Yes, you do. Hey, come on. I didn't tell her nothing, Michael. I mean, the only one I ever told was Renee, and-- and she wouldn't have told anyone. Oh, no? Yes, she would have. They can't hold onto a secret. That's why I had to get rid of her. Hey, Michael, I didn't tell her nothing. Nothing, OK? OK. OK, good. We wouldn't want her to think we're bad or anything, huh? Michael, here's your beer. OK. Come here. Musho, come here. Let me ask you something. What do you know about me and Anthony, huh? A lot. Hey, come on, all right? Michael, I didn't her nothing, I swear to god. Then let her talk. Go ahead. I know that you guys are cousins, that you grew up together, that you used to go boosting together. Boosting. Anthony stole the car, but you told him he had no imagination, that every other kid on the block stole the car. What you should do is steal a boat. So you guys stole a boat and crashed it. You see? Huh? I didn't tell her nothing. That's good. Now, let me get to bed, huh? Can I help you? Does Jamie live here? Yeah, who are you? Jamie Collins? Yeah. You know, I was driving down Orange Grove, right, and I made a left turn. And I got a ticket. And-- Yeah, well, look, pal. I think what you should do is go to the police station. That's police business, OK? This is private property here. I understand that. The thing is, I can't-- I got prior tickets. I was trying to see if I could get it voided. Look it, this is private property, OK? Yeah, I understand. I understand. But is she home? Is she home? Why don't you just take off? I told you, go to the police station. If you got a beef, handle it at the police station, all right? Yeah, right. Yeah, right. This is private property, all right? So-- -And you're-- No, that's it. Come on. -No, you're-- -Just take off. Do me a favor, all right? Just do me a favor. Just take off. Thanks. You're, uh-- I'm her husband. All right? Right. Have a good day. OK? Uh-huh. Come here, baby. Come here. Aw. That's a baby. Come on, that's a good-- What are you doing here? I'm going to work with you tonight. I'm off the case. Why? What happened? The getaway car was found this morning in Kingman, Arizona. Captain thinks they left town. What do you think? Well, if I were them, I'd leave town too. No, no. I know he's still here. I know it. Because with his first victim, Wanda Bell, he broke into her apartment, but she had a gun. She shot at him, and it scared him, and he ran away. Well, she thought she was a big hero, and the police, they took it lightly. Two days later, she was found hanging by her feet with a cut throat. At the time, the captain said, I took a chance and I lost. But he was wrong. He was wrong. I know they're coming back. I know they're going to be at the Cover Girl, and they're going to show up at the bank again. Why won't anyone listen to me? If I were you, I would just forget about being a policewoman and consider another profession, because I don't think you're going back to work. Thanks a lot, Jamie, for the moral support. [screaming] Would you like some milk, Captain? No, thanks. That's fine. I warned you about him. Yes, you did. There was nothing more I could do. Oh, don't tell me. You took a chance and you lost. This isn't the only case on my desk, Karen. We can't just place men on surveillance based on a hunch. A hunch? Four women were brutally murdered, and one of them was a police officer. I know that. That's why I'm here. Why? Why are you here? He knows you tried to set him up. Oh my god. Are you in danger? It's OK, Mama. It's all right. Jamie told him all about it. I'm afraid you might be next. What makes you think I'll hang around? Because I need you to. You're the only chance we have to nail this guy. No. Karen, we'll protect you. Oh, just like you protected the other women? This is my life we're talking about. As you wish. But I'm going to leave Officer Bird here to watch you and your mother at all times. We're leaving the state anyway tomorrow morning. Aren't we, Karen? Right. What are you doing? It's 3 o'clock in the morning. I couldn't sleep. Listen, Mom, I'm not going with you tomorrow morning. Why? Don't you see, he's going to kill again. Karen, we were going to go together. I want you to go on to Auntie Lane's house like we planned, and I'll meet you there when it's all over, all right? No, no. Listen, I already made up my mind. That's it. Please? OK? MICHAEL (ON TAPE): The cop [inaudible]. That's how [inaudible]. It wasn't a coincidence after all, huh? Michael, listen to me, please. My boyfriend's got a key. He's going to come home any minute. Your boyfriend? He called while you were in the shower. It couldn't have been him. He never calls. He just walks in. Do you want me to leave? Hm? Yes, please. See, I thought you liked me. I do. And I want to date you again, so please-- Oh, you do, huh? You see, Jamie, at the dance hall, I really, really thought you liked me. Do you like me? I do. You wouldn't lie to me, would you? No. No. No. So you're gonna die tonight, bitch. No, I'm not. Oh, you're gonna die tonight. No, I'm not. [shouting] You see, you know what really, really upset me about you? Huh? You know what really, really upset me, is that it was your husband. It was your husband. That's what really upset me. No, I'm not. I'm not gonna beg you to kill me. And I know you can't do it unless I beg you, isn't that right, Mickey? Why do you call me that, hm? It's your name, isn't it? It's what your mother used to call you. Leave her out of this, bitch. Where is she anyway? Leave her out of it! Shut up. You see, you are fucking gonna die. No, I'm not. You're gonna die. [screaming] Go to hell! [coughing] Michael! Michael, what have you done? You've turned the gas on, you son of a bitch. Beg me to kill you, and I'll let you go. Michael, please turn the gas off. Beg me to kill you, and I'll let you go. Michael, please turn the gas off. Beg me to kill you, and I'll let you go. Come on, beg me. Beg me. JAMIE (ON TAPE): Please kill me. MICHAEL (ON TAPE): Beg me. Beg me. JAMIE (ON TAPE): Please kill me. MICHAEL (ON TAPE): Beg me. As you wish, my darling. Michael? Michael, please don't go. Don't leave me. Michael! Good morning. My name is John Darren. What can I help you with? Actually, I'm looking for Ray Stanley. Ray, Ray-- Ray's busy with another customer right now. Can I show you around? Oh, no. I'm not here to buy a car. Oh. Let me go get him for you. I'll be right back. I'm Ray Stanley. Hi, I'm Karen Shore. I'm a police officer. I'm looking for your ex-wife, Marion Books. She in some sort of trouble? Oh, no. No. I just have a few questions I'd like to ask her. Well, I don't know where she is. You don't send her alimony checks or anything? Alimony checks. She took me for almost everything I had. I couldn't even get a lawyer. Her mobster friend threatened to kill me unless I moved out of the house. Was that Michael Moranzo? Yes. She was his alibi the very first time he was arrested. Now, if she's still with him, she may be in some danger, so I'd really like to find her. You're not just looking for her. You're looking for him. What's he done? Well, it's police business, but it's imperative that I find him. Well, I don't know where she is. You might be able to find her through an old girlfriend of hers. She came in looking for a car. What's her name? I'll get it for you. Oh, and one more thing. If what's his name has done the same thing to her that he's done-- well, I don't want to know about it, OK? OK. Just stay right down there, asshole. Nice and easy. Nice and easy. Let's go. Nice and easy. [inaudible] Nice and easy. Get the fuck out of the way! Damn it. Let's go. Come on, let's get the-- What the hell are you doing back here? I have a search warrant. I got a tip that you're selling contraband from this shop. Oh, yeah? Well, you've got nothing on me. You won't find anything stolen in this shop. I didn't say I would. Also, the IRS are here to audit your books. Just routine, you understand. Nothing to worry about. All right, I get the picture. So where is he? Look, I really don't know where he's at. Come on. All right. I know where his cousin is staying. [moaning] [phone ringing] Hello? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, thanks. Who was that? Sue from the pawn shop. That fucking cop was there asking questions again. Shit. I think we should fucking call this man. I know something that shouldn't be cool. Hey, Michael, what the hell are you doing? I thought you were going to free all the pigeons. I'm not going anywhere. What? I'm not going anywhere. What do you mean you're not going anywhere? A minute ago, you said we were going. I know what I said. Don't you see what the fuck is happening here? No. What's happening here? She's running us out of town? Who? That fucking cop is running us out of town like a couple of pigeons. She's a fucking broad, Michael, OK? She's not running us out of town. No? No. Then where are we going, huh? Hey, come on. No, no, no, no, no. Tell me. Tell me where we're going. Where are we going? Yeah. We're going to Tahiti, man. Fun and sun. Well, take your fucking girlfriend, and you go to fucking Tahiti, OK? And what about the cash? Take it. Michael, please, come on. Let's go. Huh? Just take the cash, and I'll catch up to you later, OK? Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Come on! Go. [honking] [music playing] What happened? Karen, I'm sorry. What? No! No! [sobbing] Oh, god. Shit. So this is your little ritual. You look confused, Michael. Musho told me all about it. They didn't quite make it to Tahiti. So Michael, who's next, huh? You know, it's too bad you don't have wings. They'd come in handy when you jump off this building. Well, go ahead, scum. Jump. Fuck you, bitch. [gunfire] What, are you fucking crazy? [gunfire] Jump! You shot me, you bitch. I'm fucking bleeding. Look at me. Please, I don't want to die. I'm not gonna kill you, Michael. I just want to hear you say I want to die. Say it, Michael. No! Say it! MICHAEL: Please, I don't want to die. Please. Please, I don't want to die. Just-- no! Will you fucking stop it? I don't want to die! Will you stop it? I'm unarmed. I need help. [inaudible] She shot me. Get me an ambulance. Get me an ambulance. I need help. She shot me! She shot my fucking arm! Let him go. You fucking bitch! Nice going, Karen. You shoot an unarmed man. We could have put this guy away for good. Now you give him a chance to get off. I'm sorry. You're under arrest. [screaming] [music playing]
