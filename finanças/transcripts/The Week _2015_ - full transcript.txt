That is the show, I'd like to thank my guest Roger Griffith of Cal Tec, fashion designer and my new BFF, Deven Crane. And of course the always loquacious, Brian Eno. And now, unfortunately, This. Yesterday, I suffered from what some are calling, an on air meltdown. The powers that be are convinced that I said some things, and did some things that I shouldn't have done. And those powers, including my wife and producer of this show, Claire, have uh made it clear that I need to publicly apologize.. Now. And if I do then, I get to keep my show. Here's the thing, I could apologize all day long, but that is not going to get my show back, because the truth is, it hasn't been my show for quite some time. So I'm not going to apologize. Not going to do it. I'm going to leave. You just watched my last show. I know, I want to thank all of you for taking this journey with me for all these years. And I know, that our paths will cross again. So for the last time, I'm Dick Romans from somewhere in Los Angeles, this has been And, Or None of the Above. Ok, hiatus is over, enough is enough.

Tell her that I've been thinking about her a lot. And I hate her guts. Could you tell her that her father died? Just tell her that some people home invaded the house. And that I was killed. Bye bye.

We talked about this. - We sure as hell never talked about Dick! Wait, what? - I'm not going to do this, I'm not going to let you rewrite this, you don't get to be mad. - Jess, can I just say, he gets to be a little mad. Shut up Dick! Ok, I'm understand that people are really pissed off right now, and I get it. All I'm trying to, I just think that maybe we can get through this, without it being such a big deal. Oh so your grand opus of self destruction isn't over yet? You fucked up your own marriage so you figured hey why not take ours down with you? You little piece of shit. - No Tom, all I'm saying is that yeah, okay, my penis was inside your wife. So hold, on I'm not finished. But now my penis is not inside of your wife. What I'm suggesting is.. We don't try to find meaning when there isn't any. Right? Wow, Thomas. - You know what, that's fair. That's a fair move. Oh my god! Oh he hit me right at the top of the head. You know what really pisses me off. You orchestrated this whole thing Jess. You weren't worried about Dick. You didn't want to take care of him. You wanted to bone him. Oh really, well who's making up stories now, Thomas? - You had sexual intercourse with the man on the porch. Yes that has been very clearly established but I didn't plan it, I didn't orchestrate Claire leaving Dick and I certainly didn't cancel the party. And anyway when we got the email you were the one who said we should come up. Wait. What? Yes Dick, we got the email. - Then what the hell are you doing here? We thought you should be around friends and we knew you wouldn't let us if we told you. But that was his idea. Do you remember that Thomas? Huh?

We could watch that. - They don't have ultimate frisbee. Oh yeah you don't think so? I bet, what if I showed you? Would you believe me then? How about boxing? - Yeah. You like boxing? Alright let's do it. Right, right, Good, right, right, right. Didn't see that coming? Always got to look... Argh! What the hell did you do? - We were boxing. - It's a common mistake with this kind of knee injury. Everybody goes back to boxing a little too soon. Fucking moron. The cat looks like a jerk. What? - It looks mean. Tugger? - Tugger? Tugger looks like an asshole. Well what do you know about cats? - I know what they look like when they're going to scratch you. That cat would lay down his goddamn life for me. I don't think so. You little shit. - Okay, no, no, no. It's best for him to be in the waiting room. Let's go Stewart, go. I'll be out there in a second bud. - Somebody should have a few words with that kid. I mean you can't just insult a man's cat. - You're on the knee, Doc. - Are you all out of your pussy cream? - I could probably use another tube. - Yeah I thought maybe you could. I'm going to need to see you in a couple days. Really? - Yeah, really. - Oh shit. So do you think my mom is cute or something? Ummmm. I have never thought about it, whether she was cute or not. Why do you think she's cute? - No, she's my mom. Right. Yeah, of course. It's a stupid question. I don't know why I asked that question. Mom's a pretty good cook but she cuts herself a lot. There's probably a lot of blood in that food that she gave you. Really? - Yeah really. Thank you for the heads up. That's disgusting. Yeah. - Glad I have the information. - Yeah. What is your deal Stewart? Hmm? I never saw my doctor get so pissed off. And I got you tell you, I like pissing him off. You know every day is like the same. It makes me mad.

It helps. Have you figured out this maze yet? No. This is the hardest maze I've ever done in my life. Yeah, you know what, can I talk to you for a second? Watch this. Watch and learn. Hi! - Hi how are you? - Great how are you? - Oh we're great. We're working on this mazes over here, and we're having some trouble getting out. What do you mean? - Well we wondered if you maybe had some sort answer key or maybe a cheat sheet we could look at and figure out how to get out of the maze. Yeah, I don't know. - Has anyone ever solved the maze? I don't know. You don't know. Jump and down and say yeah we got out! Yeah, I don't know. Do you just keep saying I don't know? I mean you can't hand out broken mazes to kids cause then they wind up heart broken and looking like this kid looks right now. Look at him, he's wrecked. You did that. It's not right. It's not right. Do you want some coffee? No, don't need a coffee. Be great to have a maze we can get out of. Yeah I bet. So can you clear up those crutches? Cause they're blocking the walkway. Asshole. - Thank you. You talking about her right? Up high. ♪ You only need me when you're drunk ♪ ♪ You only claim me when push comes to shove ♪ Hey, hey listen hold on a second. Tell me what you have Neil give me some good news because I swear to God, I'm completely in the dark. - Yeah Dickie listen, I spoke to Claire's lawyers. She doesn't want to see you, doesn't want to talk to you, she doesn't want arbitration, doesn't want mediation, and... Jesus Christ - And uh, Dickie, there's worse news. - Oh great, as long as there's worse news, let's hear it. Normally I wouldn't bring this up, but I read your horoscope this morning. And this is literally, the worst month in twelve years for you to be getting a divorce. And I'm not talking about the horoscopes in the back of some bullshit LA times, Dickie. This is the guy that Ronald Regan used. Oh fantastic - Imagine that, okay? Exclusive club, members only invited. This is the worst time for you to be thinking about getting a divorce. I don't have a lot of control over that Neil. Maybe buy her something, something meaningful. I use Etsy, are you familiar with Etsy? This woman, this lady makes personalized baskets, handmade they're wonderful. Maybe you should think about getting Claire that? You know? It'll show her that you're trying. Um, I don't even know what to say to that. How do I pull that off exactly when she doesn't want to have contact with me? Now you're telling me that I should get her a fruit basket. Based on Ronald Reagan's horoscope. They're not just baskets Dickie, they're customized to the individual. - Let me ask you something. Is this the top This is the good stuff? - I'm sorry Dickie okay? This is hard on all of us pal. I mean you and Claire are that couple. If you two can't make it work than what hope do me and Julie have? I'm fucked. You know that? - Yeah I am too. I gotta go. Goodbye. Shhh. He's sleeping. Wow. He's out? - Out. They like each other. Come on. So how'd it go? It went really well. You know what I did? P What? I had him bake cookies for you. - You guys baked cookies? Yeah you got to taste one of those. They are horrible. Right? What? Oh my god. That's the worst cookie. There's a urine kind of taste to them. I don't know how you get that in a cookie. - Why did you make me eat that? Your son made those. He takes after you.p- No. - No, he doesn't. Cause you actually cook really well. How did it go today? - Good, yeah, it was a tasting for a big country club wedding and I nailed it. Course you did. - Yeah. That it might be fun to do that thing. You know the interview thing that you were talking about. Oh yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah You know, if you were serious. - Dead serious. - Let me know. - Okay, I'll let you know right now You mean you want to do it right now? Yeah, let's do it right now. Ok, he's drunk. He's been drinking all day, he's not going anywhere. Come on, it'll be a blast. - Okay. Yeah? - Yeah. Today. Is April 11th, could you state your name for the record please? Lenny Jane Wright. - Lenny Jane Wright. What should we talk about today? We could talk about boxing, we could talk about cats. We could talk about cat boxes. We could talk about.. Only children, single mothers milk of human kindness, the DLP? Coincidence. - Let's talk about coincidence. I was almost an Icelander. That might be my favorite sentence I have ever heard. When I was in the fifth grade, um.. My father was in between jobs and he worked with computers and satellites. And he got this job offer in Iceland. So he hired me and my brother and an Icelandic tutor. And we spent the entire summer three days a week learning Icelandic with Johannes Ah Johannes. Anyway, so he was a college student on break touring America and he became part of the family. He put part of his trip on hold so that he could stay and teach us and get us ready. Because Georgia to Iceland that is a huge adjustment. That's a big jump. - Yeah. Anyway my father, he goes over there to look for a house and to get us into school and when he comes back he shows us this super 8 mm film that he shot of this street festival in Reykjavik. And there is no sound, so Johannes is talking us through it and he's telling us all about about the city, and the food. And the clothing and all of a sudden he just starts crying. Nobody knows what is going on. And he just gets up and he leaves. And we don't hear from him for like a week. And one night my dad gets this call and Johannes went back to Iceland. Now um, the reason was because, the film my dad showed us. Of the street festival, in the crowd Johannes saw his fiancè making out with his best friend. Ouch. - Yeah. That's my first memory of anything completely true. It was proven right there in front of all us. It was real. Just like your final show. The one that never aired. Truthfully, there wasn't much to air. January 13, 2012. You've done your homework. - The day that your show died. Was the same day that my husband died. January 13, 2012. It can't just be coincidence. It's the truth. And it's not good. It's not beautiful. It's just true. I feel like life keeps showing me this over and over again. I don't know what it means. Maybe that's why we're here. To figure it out. You like it? - Sort of. Not a hundred percent? - Yeah. You spoil him. - He's a good kid. - Yeah. Thanks. - Thanks yeah. Oh give me a hug. Thanks. - Yeah.. Oh, okay... hey! Wow. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You know what? I'm sorry. - Lenny? Ok, it's really narrow, you want to watch out going back. - I got it! - It's all right, take it slow through that it's really narrow. ♪ Our hearts can only betray us ♪ ♪ I can't afford to care What? - Please hold for Mr. Young. Are you ignoring me? - No I'm sorry. - No, no I'm sorry for even bothering to do this. Did you get any of my texts? Yeah I got your texts, I miss you too. I got a lot going right on now Jaron. Shit. I got a lot going on too. That's why I need to see you. I need to break bread with my favorite egghead. I'm kind of on lock down now buddy. It's complicated. Life is complicated. Hey man, have you read the trades lately? Do you have any idea what's going on in this industry that you are a part of? If not, let me explain it to you Dick. As of a few days ago, I'm officially president of the network. Hey Congratulations! Good for you. Yes, yes, and now I'm on the phone with you. Should I be flattered? Yes, mother fucker, you should be flattered. In fact you should be on an airplane heading to Los Angeles to come sit down with me. Oh boy that sounds tempting. Good I'm sending you a ticket. Oh no, now you can't, cause my mailbox got wiped out in a twister An e-ticket stupid. What do you want to see me for? That bridge is burned. The bridge is mine now, I'm the one who says if it's it burnt or not. Okay? Right now I say the bridge is not burned. What don't you understand about me being president? So come on man, stop playing around. You owe me a one on one. I need to see your face. Then Skype me and we'll have a little conversation over Skype. Hey, hey, don't nobody use Skype no more. Why do you got to be so obstinate from Jump Street, Dick? I'm not being obstinate. - No, no, see this right here, this behavior right here is why people passionately don't like you. Okay, why people like me have to fight for dumb asses like you. But I didn't ask you to fight for me. - Shhh. Stop it. Okay. Cause you wouldn't know what is good for you if it was blowing you. I do. I know what's good for you. This is what love feels like. Bring your ass down to L.A. Listen, congratulations on the promotion. - Thank you. And here's my advice, when they push you out of the window which they're going to do. Try to aim for the bodies of your predecessors, that'll soften the blow. - I'll keep that in mind. Now my advice to you. When your friend who also happens to be the President of a network tells you that this is your last chance he's not fucking around. I will see you Thursday at eleven a.m. ♪ Everybody wants their cigarettes ♪ everybody lies and everyone ♪ gets in front of me ♪ in front of me - Dick. - Lenny. I think we should probably talk about yesterday Can I just, for a real quick... ...about yesterday and the kiss. The attempted kiss. It was all my fault. It was a compulsiveness and or impulsiveness on my part and we're not even that. It was an attraction, in the moment. I was feeling an attraction towards you but I shouldn't have I shouldn't have done that. I never had to apologize for trying to kiss somebody before so it's a little weird. Weird? - It's not about the kiss though I mean it is, and I'm sorry I don't want to take away from that I have been giving this a lot of thought and what I've come up with is I'm having legitimate feelings for you Legitimate feelings? Romantic, love feelings. No. - No, no, you got to hear me out. Please Lenny No, Dick, this is bull shit. - No its not bullshit. - Oh yeah, it is, it's bull shit. I don't need to hear it. What makes you think you have legitimate love feelings? Everything. You. We're in all girl gangster rap band and so many things. You like my hat. Your son is super cool. Stewart. And he's always saying asshole. And I think that's funny. And I really, I like your food. And I love the way that you tell stories and Lenny I think that you and I are are funny and sad in the same way. Okay. What's your problem? Which one? No jokes asshole. I'm trying to raise a kid here, I'm trying to keep a business afloat. You think you're going to knock on my door and sweep me off my feet. Because I said I liked your hat? Or am I just some twitchy blonde that is going to jump into your arms because after three days you think you have romantic love feelings. Your wife just left you. Grow the fuck up Romans.

P- Oh yeah? What? - Are you going to tell me the story? - Do you want to hear it? - Ok. - I was in Costa Rica and I was on a bus that broke down right outside of so this chick, she wanders off the bus I think to get some fresh air, stretch her legs. She steps right into a fox trap. You know your brother, man, I just go into hero mode. I didn't do anything medical or that great I just fashioned her a tourniquet from some cocoa bolo branches. Sprinkled water on her lips, - Kept her hydrated. I let her use my ipod Because I think that music has a really calming soothing effect on people. There were tracks that I were working on they weren't mastered so I was a first a little.. She didn't seem to mind too much. She was screaming pretty loud. I don't even know if she heard the music. After she got out of the hospital, she invited me to stay with her. Which was super cool you know, she had this rad little place on the beach You would have really dug it. We just lived, man and hung out. And I made music. And she painted, we laughed, and we made love every day. Mostly in the mouth because I couldn't stand to look at her from the waist down because it was really tough her leg was so disgusting. To me, it's life It's sort of wobbly and unpredictable but you have to embrace it. Before I spilt I stole that painting. So was next for you? Didn't you have this sort of deal going down At the network maybe, who cares, it's probably just a run around, it doesn't matter. No it does, you have to stay positive with this kind of thing. Do you have to really? Staying positive can help you? - I think it would be great, you know change of scenery for you, come out to L.A., kind of boost your energy a little bit. LA is great for that what would be cool is you'd be here for the birth too Birth? Of what? Baby's due in early September. What are... I'm just not sure what the fuck you're talking about man. Lydia is pregnant. Oh. Who's Lydia? Lydia is my lady. And she's pregnant with your baby. That's what you tell me right now, that you're going to have a baby in a couple months. That's it. This is the first time I'm hearing about this Mick. I thought I told you. Dude! Come here, really? Yeah. Surprised you. It's beautiful man, it's beautiful. And crazy and funny. And sad. Why sad? I don't know. I don't even know why I said it. I really don't cause I know what you mean. It's weird right? It is a little sad. You know what have been really sweet is if I was good enough husband to get one of those mugs that says world's greatest husband. I got seven Grammys. Seven Grammys? - So what. So what? I tell you so what, it feels great. It's not about the mugs, I don't care about the mugs. I'm lost. I'm stuck. I'm like in a maze. I was in Glastonbury for a little it was a little festival, there's was I party I wound up at over at Annie Lennox's castle, and she has this hedge maze. It's one of these traditional old fashioned it was real, there I was in the middle of this hedge maze and I'm not doing too well. I kind of stop, and I plant myself because I don't want get any further in. Anyway, here comes Annie Lennox and she grabs my hand and looks me directly in the eyes she said put your hand on the maze wall and you leave it there. As long as you have your hand on the wall and keep moving, you'll find your way out. Oh man. It was amazing. So you made it out of the maze? No, I don't believe I did. I think it might be time for bed. Look they might be using Jaron to lure me down here so they can take turns throwing cinder blocks at me. If things get ugly I want you to start kicking some throats. Oh oof. By chance do you have one of those mini scissors, the travel size? I don't want to pull this. Lose a button. No? Gentleman, Mr. Young is ready for you. Where is he? There's my..

Could I say something first? - Sure. - It's just that you know, last time you came by I couldn't do that right then. Okay? My mind couldn't do that. I just couldn't process the idea of a romantic gesture from you or anybody, or nobody You know what I mean? - I do. - The idea of being kissed It just felt so wrong With all the unhappiness death and the guilt. But I turned all that, I shut it off all that stuff You started fiddling with all those knobs and it really just kind of pissed me off. Does any of this make any sense? - Total sense. Okay. I've been giving it a lot of thought. I think that we could be good friends - Yeah. And if we're good friends then who knows what. - Who knows? I think you're a good man. Thank you.
