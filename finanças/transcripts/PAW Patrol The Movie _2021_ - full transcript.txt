We're not going to make it! You can open your eyes now. We made it. Great work, paw patrol! Everybody get back! The truck's leaking gas! Come on, that's not gas. That's the stuff I've been hauling from coast to coast. That is pure Canadian maple syrup! Okay, time to clean up this mess. Deploy waffles, pancakes, and French toast!

I'm done with it. Buzz off, wiener dog. "Wiener dog"? Maybe you should just pick that up and put it in the trash! Yeah? Or what? Or I'm going to pick you up and put you in the trash. Hey, I don't want no trouble. I'm pickin' up the trash, I'm pickin' up the trash. Thank you. We've all got to take pride in our city. Don't ever forget that. This is the d train... This is my stop. It's been a slice. I'm going to turn my life around. I really am. Hey, Liberty! It's election day in adventure city. I'm Marty muckraker, reporting live from city square. In a surprising twist, the leading candidate has dropped out of the race, leaving only one name on the ticket. Mayor humdinger, who has just won by default. Mayor humdinger. Just saying it makes my skin crawl. No dogs. By order of the new mayor. - Excuse me? - Yeah, you heard him. No dogs. He's more of a cat person. Now beat it! If those are the rules, those are the rules. You gentlemen have a wonderful day. Did you see that? You gotta show these dogs you're the Alpha. You're not the Alpha. I'm the Alpha! - No, I'm the Alpha! - No, I'm the Alpha! I'm the Alpha! Right this way, ma'am. - I'm the Alpha! - No. I'm the Alpha! - Thanks for the lift! - Happy to help. Excuse me, coming through, make way, pardon me, underfoot. Please welcome to the stage, a man who needs no introduction. He's literally the greatest human being on the planet. He's me! I am the champion thank you, thank you. - Really? - Yeah... I want to start off by thanking each and every one of you for choosing me to be your new mayor. You were the only name on the ballot! You could only vote for one name anyway, so what does it matter? I won this election fair and square. Well, maybe not fair, but who's keeping track? You know, they call this place adventure city, but what's so adventure-y about it? The truth is, it's boring. Libraries? Boring! Museums? Boring! Cute little dog parks? Definitely boring! But don't worry. I'm going to put the adventure back in adventure city! When I'm done with this place, you won't even recognize it. Paw patrol. What's your emergency? What? You answer your own calls? Oh, my goodness, I didn't even think I was gonna... I can't believe I'm looking at the pa w patrol! I am such a big fan! This is off the leash! Is there something we can help you with? Yes, yes, yes! My name is Liberty, and I'm calling from adventure city. Something terrible has happened. Humdinger was just elected mayor. Humdinger? He's the worst mayor in the history of mayors! And that's being generous. You're telling me, this guy's a disaster! He's going to destroy the whole city. Please, we need your help. Come quickly! Adventure city's in trouble. Come on, pups, pack your things. No city's too big, no pup's too small! Yeah! What's wrong, chase? I'm not going. We have to go. They need us. I'm never going back to adventure city! Chase... What's got his leash in a knot? Chase has a history with adventure city. He has a lot of tough memories from that place. He was abandoned there as a pup. The city was so big, and he was so small. It was a hard life. The city can be a scary place when you're all alone. - Is that where you found him? - That's right. And I brought him back here to adventure bay. Chase? Let's talk about this. I don't want to go back to adventure city. I know it was tough, but that was a long time ago. I'm afraid if I go back there, everyone will see I'm still that scared little puppy, and not the hero they think I am. I promise it will be nothing like it was when you were little. Everything will be fine. Come on, chase. Those people need our help. We're the paw patrol, this is what we do. Trust me. Okay. I trust you. Now, can I get a yelp? Come on. You can do better than that. Attaboy! Let's get to work. Skye, chase, rocky, Marshall, Zuma... Rubble! It's not my fault! I couldn't decide what to bring. So I brought everything! Get there, come on. Come on, come on! See? It fits! Paw patrol is on a roll! Road trip! Wake up, pups, we're here! - Check it out! - Cool! - No way! - It's amazing! This place is so much bigger than adventure bay. You okay, chase? It's a lot bigger than I remember. It's like they super-sized it! Rain! Does it always rain in this lousy city? Okay, which one of you eggheads is in charge? Hello! I'm the lead egghead. Kendra Wilson. I've got a fireworks celebration tonight and they're going to cancel it because of the rain. I hear you have a weather machine that sucks up clouds. Is that true? You're looking at it. It's a free-floating gyroscopically balanced remote-controlled weather containment and analysis apparatus. What? I don't understand a word you just said. Well... We call it the cloud catcher. It flies around and sucks up clouds, then brings them back to the lab so we can study them. Excellent, excellent. Well, kitties, it looks like our bad weather problem is solved. I want all those pesky rain clouds sucked up by the end of the day. I'm sorry if I wasn't clear. The cloud catcher is for studying clouds, not for changing the weather. And I'm sorry if I wasn't clear. Suck up those clouds or I'm closing this university forever! Well... I guess we could try using it to clear the rain clouds. - Just for tonight. - Wonderful! That's what I call scientific consensus! My top hat! Here you go, boss. That's incredible! We'll have the sky clear by sundown. I've got a bad feeling about this. I'll hang on to this remote! People are going to love these fireworks, and more importantly, they're going to love me! All right, pups, keep an eye out for the new headquarters. - We're almost there. - Yeah! - Cool! - Dudes, I can't wait! - Where is it? - There's so many buildings! I wonder which one it is. Yeah. Couldn't have missed that. Welcome to our new adventure city headquarters. Awesome! Now that's a view! How can we afford this place? Officially licensed paw patrol merchandise. This stuff sells like hot cakes! We've got everything we need at our fingertips. - Marshall! - Marshall! Next time, warn me before you stick a building up my nose! This is so cool! It's so high-tech! And check this out. There's even a new and improved pup treat dispenser. What? It's a beautiful thing. Last but not least, this is our mission prep area. Everybody's got their own cubby. I want that one! No, rubble, don't! That cubby belongs to... Skye! Skye. It's not important how it looks, it's how it makes you feel. I think you guys are going to have to cut me out of this thing. Actually, I'm good. Ladies and gentlemen, I've gathered you here tonight for a very important reason. To celebrate me! Prepare to be blown away by the most breathtaking fireworks display you've ever seen! Time to light up the sky! Yeesh! This is less than spectacular. You, ponytail man! Why are you taking so long between fireworks? I'm building momentum, man. I have a whole routine mapped out in my head. Nobody's got time for your self-indulgent, hippy-dippy art project. They want spectacle! Rock and roll, man! They're all for me! Oh, boy! How often do you get to see fireworks this close? My top hat! Here you go, boss! This is why dogs hate fireworks! I'm no expert, but aren't fireworks supposed to explode in the sky? Let's see what's going on! It looks like mayor humdinger's fireworks display has turned into a fireworks disaster. We've got to stop those fireworks before they burn down the city. Time to suit up! Thanks, robot arm! Paw patrol, ready for action, Ryder sir! This is your new car. Awesome! So cool! I could get used to this. You better hang on to your hat. Chase! Ready for launch in five... Four... three... two... one. Marshall. Go! Skye. Ready for launch! Skye is go for launch. That's got a kick to it! Paw patrol is on a roll... Are you kidding me? Come on! This is ridiculous! Green means go! Green means go! Green does still mean go, right? You're taking main street at rush hour? No wonder you're stuck in traffic! I'm Liberty. We spoke on the phone. So nice to finally meet you in person. Ryder. What your team needs is a pup like me. I know the city like the back of my paw. Uptown, downtown, crosstown, midtown. 24-7, 365, I'll get you where you need to be! Well, we could use a hand getting out of this traffic jam. That's what I'm talking about. My first assignment! - Get out of the way! Move! - Okay! Move! Move! You've got to know how to talk to people. Now go! Excuse me! - Pardon me! - Coming through! Have a nice day! Turn here! Left! Right, then right again, right away! You see that? I'm like a furry GPS! Turn left! You have reached your destination. Now we know what happens when you give humdinger fireworks! The paw patrol? What are they doing in adventure city? Chase, set up a perimeter. Chase is on the case! Paw patrol! Shields! Marshall, rocky, put out those fireworks! Let's kick the tires and fight some fires! Mr. Mayor, we've got to get you out of here. I can't believe the paw patrol crashed my party. - Yes, sir. - I can't stand those dogs! Everyone knows you're a cat person. - I can't stand them! - Yes, sir. Hey, wait up! Time to fight some fireworks! We're gonna need more water! Water Cannon! Yes! Now that's what I'm talking about. - Nice work, Marshall! - Thank you. Rocky, you're up! Okay, I got it from here! And crush 'em! Ride 'em, cowboy! Look at him go! Perimeter secure! Ryder, we've got people trapped on the balcony! I'm going in. Copy that. Eject! Parachute! Everything's going to be fine. I'm going to get you out of here. Ryder, help! Marshall! Chase needs help! I'm on it! Stand back! Get away from the edge! Help me get him down! - Careful. - Help me get him off. It's okay, buddy. I've got you. - Say cheese! - Cheese! Hey! Hey! Anyone want a picture with me? I'm kind of like an honorary member of the paw patrol. You should have seen me out there. I was like, "turn left, turn right, turn left, turn right..." It was amazing! You look okay. How do you feel? I can't believe I forgot to disconnect my parachute. It's air rescue 101. Well, that's why we're a team. Everyone pulled together, and things worked out okay. But what if they didn't? What if something happened to those people and it was all my fault? Guardians. Heroes. Cute little dogs in adorable outfits. Whatever you call them, the pa w patrol were here to save the city from mayor humdinger's disastrous fireworks debacle. As a professional journalist, it's important that I remain unbiased. That being said... oh, yikes! An embarrassing start for mayor humdinger, but an incredible debut for the raw patrol in adventure city! Paw patrol? Paw patrol? I'm sick and tired of hearing about the paw patrol! I came to adventure city to get away from them and make a name for myself. Now they're all over the TV stealing my headlines! Butch! Ruben! Get in here! Sorry, sir. I want the paw patrol off the streets now! Find them, catch them, and lock them away. - Yes, sir. - Right away, sir. The paw patrol have humiliated me for the last time! Sorry, did you say something? What? No, no! I was just having a private moment! Now get out of here! Liberty! I hear that sound, and I know it's you. I know, I know, I've got to get my wagon fixed. So, how's the fruit business, Tony? Well, it would be better if I wasn't always giving you free fruit. Hey, you hear about that fireworks fiasco last night? I didn't just hear about it, I was there. Honestly, Tony, it was the best night of my life. For a few hours, it was like I was a real member of the paw patrol. Imagine that, huh? "The newest member of the paw patrol, Liberty!" Yeah, right, I wish. I heard that new mayor is monkeying with the subway now. You better stay off those trains, kiddo. - Stick to your wagon. - Thanks for the tip, Tony. Hey, Liberty. Take one for the road! Thank you! Another perfect day in adventure city. Enjoy that sunbeam, kitties. Mr. Mayor! The cloud catcher's hygrometer is overloading the capacity of its pressurized internal containment chamber! What? Do I look like a scientist to you? We need to bring down the cloud catcher now! And ruin this beautiful weather? The cloud catcher wasn't designed to run non-stop. Nonsense! As long as I'm mayor, the sun will always shine on adventure city. Now get her out of here. - Get out of here! - Get out of here! What are you doin'? I'm the one who tells people to get out of here. No, you're not. I'm in charge! - No, I'm in charge! - I'm in charge! I'm in charge! Citizens of adventure city! As your new, and already favorite, mayor, I proudly present the next step in my plan to put the adventure in adventure city. The humdinger hyperloop! The kookiest, swoopiest, loop-de-loopiest subway the world has ever seen! I am not riding that thing. Mr. Mayor, Mr. Mayor! Have you considered the possibility that this is the single dumbest idea that anyone has ever had ever? I'm an unqualified elected official. What's the worst that could happen? Look, here comes the express train now. Throw the switch, kitties! That is not good. Butch, get the car. Ruben, get the kitties. Time for me to vamoose! Paw patrol, what's your emergency? Help! Help us! Mayor humdinger stuck a loop-de-loop in the middle of the subway track, and now, we're hanging on for dear life! This is a new low for subway service in this city, and that is saying something! Hang tight! We're on our way! Okay, pups. We've got to rescue the passengers on that train before the whole thing comes crashing down. Let's move! Paw patrol is on a roll! Yeah! Marty muckraker reporting live from mayor humdinger's latest disaster. In a surprising twist that surprised nobody, the shoddily built upside-down subway turned out to be a steaming hot pile of, dare I say, poop. Look, mom, the pawpatrol! I can't believe humdinger thought this was a good idea. The subway's wild enough without a stinkin' loop-de-loop! Hey, Liberty! Reporting for duty. Unofficially, of course. You know, like an honorary member. Rocky, I need you to stabilize that loop. Rubble, see if you can lock it into place with some quick-dry cement. We're on it! Skye, I need you to secure that loop from the air. Let's take to the sky! Don't worry, Ryder, I've got crowd control under control. Stand back! Give us some space! Paw patrol at work! I'm an honorary member at the moment, but my authority should still be respected. Hydraulic arms! Gotcha! - Hey, look! - It's Skye! Time for a little more power. Afterburners! Okay, rubble, let 'er rip! Rubble on the double! The track is secure! Yeah, rubble! Nice work, rubble! Chase, we've got to rescue those people. Are you up for it? Chase is on the case. Hang on! You're going to be okay. Zipline! Chase! Chase! Chase! How are you holding up, chase? I'm fine. Are you sure? I can do this! - Chase! Chase! Chase! - You can do it, chase! I can do this. Chase! Chase! Chase! Chase! I can do this. I can... Chase? Chase, do you copy? Ryder, we've got a problem. What's going on? It's chase. Something's wrong. He's just standing there. Chase is in trouble. Skye, bring him down. Marshall, get your ladder up to the train. I'm on it! I think I can reach them from here. Ladded Please exit the train and proceed down the ladder. This should speed things up. Ladder slide! Here goes nothing! Nice work, Marshall! Chase? I'm coming out to get you. What's wrong? Tell me what happened. I don't know. I just... froze. It's okay. Everyone's safe. Let's get you down. Okay, that's all of them. Good job, pups. Chase... I don't know what happened. I'm just glad you're okay. - I'm sorry. - No, it's my fault. I thought you'd be okay in adventure city, but it's still too much for you. I'll be fine. I just need to... You're not fine. You need to take a break. We'll take care of the rescues for a while. What? No! That's not fair. I'm sorry, chase. I know it's hard, but it's the way it's got to be. I didn't even want to come to adventure city! I trusted you. You said everything would be fine, but it's not! What kind of leader gives up on someone the second things get hard? Chase... Chase, wait! What do we have here? Looks like we got one of them paw patrols all on his own. Get the net. Chase? Chase! - Come on, chase. - Chase? Chase! Hey, buddy, where are you? Where'd you go, bud? Chase! - Oh, no. - Where did he go? I was right behind him. I turned the corner and he was gone. He just disappeared. - What are we going to do? - I don't know. There's no way for us to track him if he's not wearing his pup tag. We might not have a tracking collar, but the city has eyes, and the city has ears. Somebody had to see something. Okay. Where do we start? We need to pound the pavement. I'll get myjackhammer! No, not like that. "Pound the pavement" means we're gonna need to talk to everyone. Ask questions. Leave no stone unturned. Then I'll get the stone turning attachment for my dozer. Can someone please explain it to him? Out of the way! Learn to drive! Someone should take away his license. Stop this vehicle right now! I'm a police dog and you're under arrest! Oh, no! You hear that, butch? We're under arrest. Hey, why do you get to wear the hat? 'Cause I took it from him! Well, I'm taking it from you! - Give me that back, it's my hat! My hat! - No, it's my hat! Hey, hands on the wheel! So unprofessional! Quit squirming! Put me down! Let me go! Welcome to your new home. What is this place? It's fuzzy buddies obedience school! - Isn't it awesome? - What? We're gonna learn so many new tricks, like sit, and roll over, and sit. Barney, how many times do I have to tell you? It's not an obedience school anymore. Mayor humdinger's goons took over this place and turned it into a jail. Old humdinger's not exactly a dog lover. He's more of a cat person. He's rounding up all the dogs in the city, and locking us in here. That's terrible. Never let your guard down in here. There's one guy you gotta watch out for. He'll sneak up behind you when you least expect it. There he is! Don't worry, guys, I'll protect you! Leave my friends alone! He got away! I gotta get out of here. So what's your story, kid? I don't even know anymore. I thought I was a member of the paw patrol. But now I feel like they're better off without me. What makes you say a thing like that? I keep messing up and letting everyone down. I can't even, with all this negativity. Just ignore her. She's all bark and no bite. Now pick yourself a doghouse. You're gonna be here awhile. Come on, in here! Liberty! How's life treating you these days? Carmen, I got no time for chitchat. We're in a jam and we need your help. Have you seen this dog? No, I haven't seen him. If you want, you can put his picture up on the wall. Lots of dogs going missing lately. I'm keeping my eyes open, but it's like they just... disappear. How long has this been happening? It started a couple days ago. Now, half my customers are missing a dog. This can't be a coincidence. Somebody's got to be taking them. Dog-napping? Who would do that? Humdinger! It's got to be him. He hates dogs more than anything. But where is he taking them? I think I know how we can find out. - How? - I'm a dog. I'm also kind of an honorary member of the paw patrol, so I'll be the bait. I get captured, you tail me, and boom, we find out where he's taking them. That might actually work. We just need to figure out how to get humdinger's attention. Leave that to me. Marty muckraker here, bringing you an exclusive interview with recently disgraced mayor humdinger. Thanks, Marty. After today's little subway snafu, I just wanted to assure the public there will be no more embarrassing mishaps. Put a cork in it, windbag! Somebody get this filthy dog away from me! Gotcha! Oh, no! Please! Let me go! Don't take me to exactly the same place you took the other dogs in this white Van, license plate number wp 8624! You, with the pants on your head, - get me a new pair of pants. - Right away, sir! When my new pants arrive, we'll take this interview from the top. Mr. Mayor, we're live. If this goes viral, I'm canceling the Internet! Get back here! I'm gonna get you! Was this one easier to catch, or are we getting better at this? We're definitely getting better at this. Chase? Chase? Anybody here seen a German Shepherd about yay high, always saying, "chase is on the case"? Liberty? Hey, buddy! I came to bust you out of here. Puh4ease. This scrawny little purse pup is going to pull a jailbreak? You talk a lot of trash for a dog who looks like a toilet brush. Come on, chase, get up. You shouldn't have come after me. Now we're both stuck in here. Of course I came after you. I mightjust be one small pup, all alone in the big city, but I can still make a difference. I can still be a hero, just like you. - I'm no hero. - Yeah, right. And I'm a purebred show dog with papers. You're serious. I used to think I was a hero, but it turns out I'm just scared. 80? Who cares if you're scared? Heroes get scared all the time. - They do? - Of course they do. But even though they're scared, they push through and keep going. That's what makes them heroes. While you chew over that knowledge I just dropped, I'm gonna get us outta here. We're stuck in here, Liberty. That door is always locked, and it's the only way out. Well, there's one thing I forgot to mention. I brought backup! - Rubble! - On the double! Yeah! Chase! - What's going on in here? - What's going on in here? Get 'em! Charge! I'm gonna get ya! I'm gonna get ya! Yes, we're free! All right, pups, let's roll. Chase, you ride with me. You cool back there, Liberty? I'm doing great! Come on, you bucket of bolts, don't quit on me now! Chase and I have to make a stop. We'll meet you back at headquarters. Aye aye, Ryder sir! See you there. Where are we going? There's something I need to show you. Do you remember this place? This is where I found you. Why would you bring me here? I know this place reminds you of the worst time in your life. But there's more to it than that. It's also a great place. I remember the first time I saw you. You were a tiny little pup, all alone in the big city. I know. You saw me and took pity on me. Not at all. What I saw was a brave, heroic pup. Even though you were too small to look after yourself, and you were up against all those scary things, you got back up and kept going. I didn't adopt you because I felt sorry for you. I chose you because you were the bravest pup I'd ever seen. I know adventure city has been tough for you, but I also know that deep down you were born to be a hero. So, what do you say? Wanna go to work? Ready for action, Ryder sir. Here you go, boss. Let's make history. Mayor humdinger! Don't sneak up on me like that. The cloud catcher's precipometer has short-circuited and the barometric pressure has dropped below 87 kilopascals! What? I never know what you're talking about. Dumb it down for me! We've got to bring down the cloud catcher, it's gonna blow! Hogwash! Give me that. What are you doing? There's a free-floating meteorological weather containment system overhead, and the anemometer readings are off the charts! What? We 're all in grave danger. In danger of having the time of our lives! Thank you, Kendra, for that lovely introduction. You're making a big mistake! Ladies and gentlemen, members of the press, and most importantly influencers with over 10,000 followers, we are gathered here today for the grand opening of humdinger heights! I took the tallest skyscraper in adventure city and stuck a brand-new tower on top, wmmgfimm the tallest building in the world! And I've put my office right at the top. Now you'll have to look up to me, and I'll always look down on you. #humdinger! Oh, no! Marty muckraker reporting live with a correction to this morning's weather forecast. Instead of clear blue skies and gentle breeze, it will now be pitch-black skies and hurricane-force winds. This just in. I've been lying about my hair! Yikes, that's looking gnarly. - Rubble! - What? Lightning is frightening! Paw patrol. What's your emergency? What's the emergency? The mesoscale convective system is causing exponential thermal lift and catastrophic downbursts at over 190 knots! What? It's a super bad storm. Come on, guys, keep up. Finally, somebody gets me! This is not a regular storm. It's being caused by a weather-control device that's unleashing weeks' worth of bad weather all at once! Take cover. We're on our way. Chase. Ready for launch. Go! Marshall. Go! Rubble. Go! Rocky. Go! Zuma, go! Go get 'em, pups! You know, Liberty, I've been thinking. You're kind of like an honorary member of the paw patrol, right? I suppose you could say that. I mean, your words, not mine. But to be an official member, you'd need a faster vehicle, right? I know, I know, my ride's a rusty old wagon with a wonky wheel that goes... You don't have to rub it in. Is that... It's yours. Okay, Liberty, play it cool, play it cool. This is amazing! It's the greatest thing I've ever seen in my life! I've never been so happy! It's like my whole life has been building towards this moment! All my dreams have come true! It's so amazing! Looking good, Liberty. Liberty! Ready for launch. The voice said my name! I can't believe this is really happening! Five... Four... three... Wait, I'm not sure I'm ready for this. - Two... - You might want to hang on. One... go! - Yeah, Liberty! - Nice wheels! Welcome to the team! I can't wait to do that again! Okay, team, we've got no idea what we're heading into. We're going to have to improvise. Closing in on humdinger heights! Things are getting pretty hairy out here! Rocky, Marshall, rubble, get those people inside! Zuma, Liberty, make sure the streets are clear. Aye aye, Ryder! - Incoming! - Look out! Nice catch! You can count on me, Ryder. The cloud catcher has gone critical. There's no way to bring it down! - We'll see about that. - Be careful up there. Don't worry about me. I can handle a little turbulence. Zuma, this is Liberty. Streets are empty, everyone's safe. Copy that. Good job, Liberty! - Help! - Hold on! There's a car in the water. I'm diving in! Submarine! - Help! - Help! I'm right behind you, Zuma! Copy that! I'm in your raft, headed downstream. I'm closing in on the car. Gotcha! Scuba suit! It's the paw patrol! Everybody say cheese! - Cheese! - Hi! Now is not the time for selfies! Okay, the rescue raft is in position! Ryder, this is Zuma! The family is safe and we're headed to dry land. Good job, pups! You have to get out of the street right now! It's not safe! The mayor is up there! I'll get humdinger. You get her to safety. Everybody inside! This way! Follow me! Everybody, stay away from the windows! Hey! That's my hair! Where did you find it? The hair found me. It was my destiny. Well, it's my signature look! Buy your own hair! Cloud catcher, dead ahead! This is gonna get bumpy. It's okay, kitties, we'll just hunker down and ride out the storm. - Mayor humdinger? - Yes? How can I help you? Ryder? What are you doing here? This tower isn't safe. We've got to get you out of here. Oh, no, the power's out. That means the elevator's dead. We have to go now. Nice try! I'm not going anywhere with you. My top hat! Okay, fine. I'll go with you. But I want to make it very clear, this is not a rescue. It's an "assisted exit." You can call it whatever you want, as long as you get in the elevator now! I'll release the cables manually from above. Once I've lowered you down safely, I'll rappel down the elevator shaft. Show off. Even though we've had our personal differences over the years, I take no pleasure in doing this. Doing what? Actually, that's pretty satisfying. One one thousand, two one thousand, three one thousand, four one thousand, five one thousand. Nothing to worry about, everything's fine. Okay, pups, humdinger's out! I'm coming down. Nice job, Ryder! See you on the ground. That's not good. That's very not good! Ryder! Shields! Motorcycle! Suction tires! I'm coming, Ryder! Ryder? Ryder? Where are you? Ryder! I can see your light. Hang on! I can do this. I can do this. I can do this! Grappling hook! Oh, no! Disconnect pup pack. Ryder... I chose you because you were the bravest pup I'd ever seen. Ryder! Ryder? Chase! I can't believe you found me! You can always count on me, Ryder. Come on, we gotta get out of here! I can't. I'm stuck. On three, pull as hard as you can. One, two, three! Come on! It won't budge. One more try. You did it! We did it. I told you you were a hero. Now come on. Let's get out of here. Just a little bit further. Great. Lightning. Target acquired. Fire! Got it! Don't got it! Warning. Warning. Warning. Come on, baby, turn it around! Okay, cloud catcher, catch this! Eject! What's that? - Yay, Skye! - Awesome! Good job, Skye! That was totally awesome! You're definitely my favorite pup. I hope Ryder got insurance on my copter. That'll buff right out. - He's okay! - All right! Yeah! Okay, okay. Give him some air. How do you feel? Covered in drool. I can't help it, I'm a bulldog. My tongue is too big for my mouth! See? You did good, pups. Time for me to get out of here! Hey! Mayor humdinger! You are under arrest for gross negligence, public endangerment, and dog-napping! You can't arrest me, I'm the mayor! - He's getting away! - Mini-drone! Hey, hey, hey! Put me down! Nobody makes a fool of mayor humdinger five times in the same day! Well, this is humiliating. Here you go, boss. That's better. Adventure city is our home. It's up to all of us to take care of it. But once in a while, a group of heroes... Go above and beyond the call of duty. They look out for their neighbors before they look out for themselves. And they're so darn cute, I just want to squeeze 'em! It is our great honor to present the key to adventure city to... - The pa w patrol! - The paw patrol! Me and the paw patrol, we go way back!
