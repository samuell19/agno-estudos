[♪♪♪♪♪] [DISTANT POLICE SIREN BLARING] [♪♪♪♪♪] [CAR HORN HONKS] [CHANGE RATTLES] Thank you, brother. See anything? They've been up there all night. I say it's time for their wake up call. Let's do it. [HORN HONKS] [DRIVER GRUMBLES] [COUPLE ARGUING UPSTAIRS] [TELEVISION PLAYING INDISTINCTLY] [MAN INSIDE SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] MAN: They are nuclear, and they are active. We've also got some troop transport coming in from the Hawaiian islands and Southern Pacific-- Who's there? I'm here to fix your door. What's wrong with it? It's broken! Hey! Hey! Hey, Lou, come on-- Whoa. Sorry, boys. We got to cancel this show. Your spying days are over. Uncle Sam's real touchy about his secrets. Likes to keep them to himself! You have a right to remain silent. [GUNFIRE] You all right? Go! Go, get some exercise. I think we're going to sit this one out. [BABY CRYING] [WOMAN YELLS IN SPANISH] Get back! [WOMAN SCREAMS] [GUNSHOT] [WOMAN CRYING AND SHOUTING IN SPANISH] [CRYING CONTINUES] [CROWD CHATTERING] MAN: Hey, Nick! WOMAN: Hi, Nick! Hey, smells good. Well! Hey! [BOTH SPEAKING IN CATALAN] How you doing? [SPEAKING IN CATALAN] How many years have I been correcting you? You are Catalan, Nicolau. Learn your language. I will someday. I promise. Your head is as hard as nails. And don't tell me you are still riding your motorcycle without helmet. Don't worry. My head's as hard as nails. [CHUCKLES] Hey, Nick. Hey, Pop. Glad to see you got dressed up. I made it, didn't I? Just in time to do the dishes. Oh, Nicky. Oh, hey. For you. Oh, well... Nicky, you should have. Party's almost over. Sorry I'm late, Ma. If I had a nickel for every time I heard you say that, I'd be a very wealthy woman. You are a wealthy woman. You're married to this old guy. Hey, I'll give you this old guy stuff. Hey, hey, hey. Don't hit your old dad. I'll buy you a beer. Thanks. Pa, what's-- What's Claire doing here? I think your mother invited her. Ma? I think your father invited her. Oh, guys... I promise I had no idea that you would be here. I know, I know. It's the same for me. My parents like to think that we're still married. Hmm. You cut your hair. Yeah, two years ago. Where does time go? Time? That was our problem, wasn't it, Nick? You'd kiss me goodbye in the morning and come back later that year. What about now? Now? There are still some empty spaces. But I don't wait up any longer wondering if I'll ever see you again. Don't take this the wrong way, but I'm-- I'm really glad you're here. Don't worry. I stopped holding my breath a long time ago. [PLAYS MELANCHOLY TUNE] And now a little something I played at the command performance for the queen. [PHONE RINGS] [PLAYS "CHOPSTICKS"] That one I know! Okay! Nicky, you have a telephone call. Okay. You have any plans tonight? You tell me. Hello. MAN: Guess whose old partner is in town? In fact, I think he's out front. [CHUCKLES] Nicky. So how's retired life, huh? Busy. Busy. What's up? Well, my 30 days are up. Disability is over. I started back to work this morning. Congratulations. How's the wing? Hey! Still works. So guess what my first assignment is. I don't know. What? Look, I got a party to get back to. I am supposed to convince you to go see McCall. What for? Why do you think? Look, man, everybody got a copy of my letter. I resigned, and he knows that I'm not going back. Nicky. Nicky, McCall trained you. You owe the old man more than a letter. You owe him a face to face. And he asked me personally-- No. I'll think about it. Thank you. Have you thought about it? Back off. I'll call you tomorrow. Apparently, this can't wait, Nick. McCall's in L.A. Your tickets are inside. What's the big rush here? What big rush? Hey, your plane doesn't leave for an hour, pal. Same old, same old. He's going to try to get me on a case. I'm not signing up. Then just talk to him, huh? Settle things in person. Shrinks call it, uh, closure. So how'd I do on my first assignment back? Oh, inspiring. Truly inspiring. Shrinks call it pure bull. [CAR DOOR OPENS THEN CLOSES] Sorry, Claire. The story of our lives. Would've been fun tonight. Don't take this wrong, Nick. But maybe it's for the best. [♪♪♪♪♪] [DOOR OPENS THEN CLOSES] [♪♪♪♪♪] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Come on in. Nick. Good to see you, Tom. Coffee? No, thanks. I'd offer you a chair, but, well, you know. Yeah, they're always temporary quarters, aren't they? Yeah, not even a phone. Had to buy this thermos with my own money. That's a good choice. Hate the ones with Big Bird on 'em. I was real sorry to hear about that little boy. This job is the worst sometimes. Yeah. I'm not going to play any games here. I need you back for one more. The last one was one too many. It's not a heavy job. But I need a good actor. And there's just not time to cast someone else. Well, I wish I could help you, but I've had it with this, Tom. Come on, just one more, as a favor? After that, well, we can just exchange Christmas cards-- No, all right? I'm tired of kicking doors down for a living. And quite frankly, I don't want to see anybody die in front of me again. All right. Thanks for flying in. But we have a chance to nail Aldo Testi. I'll do it myself if I have to. I'm just not sure I can pull these things off anymore. He dropped anchor a couple of days ago. Word is he's spreading out from Spain, his eyes on America. Drugs? Drugs, arms, security secrets. Last year, he exchanged babies on the black market for Cuban cigars. Aldo Testi never was Man of the Year material. Look, Nick, I don't have to tell you how much putting away Testi would mean to Washington, or the rest of the world for that matter. He's out there in the harbor, why don't you just go nail him? Ah, they want the whole store. Everybody and everything in it. All you have to do is get close to him, learn all you can. Information gathering. Simple as that. Nobody gets dirty, I promise. What's the setup? The bureau spent three years creating a cover for you. One Joseph Bonnet. And who does Mr. Testi think Mr. Bonnet is? A broker for bad guys based in the States. The fact that you have Mediterranean blood... He's supposed to trust me? A hell of a lot more than he would me, little pilgrim. It's all in there. Your bio, ID, the works. He'd have had you checked out, so be sure you know all your lines. Here's a hotel key, clothes are in the closet. I didn't say I was going to do it. Didn't have to. No matter what, you still care. [♪♪♪♪♪] I'll think about it. Testi's leaving tomorrow. He's expecting a Joseph Bonnet tonight. Hmm. One more, and you won't ask again? One more. After that it's just "Merry Christmas." My home to yours. [DOOR CLOSES] [SOFT MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS] [CHATTERING] They said you had blond hair. They must've known me as a baby. Maybe I heard it wrong. Please come in. This is my little brother Carlo. We have a great relationship. I do the talking. He does the listening. Let's just get started, okay? Please sit down. So is no one going to get Mr. Bonnet a drink? No, no. I'm fine. Thank you. You recognize this? The Santa Maria. The ship Columbus sailed in when he discovered your country. And now my ship sails from Spain to America to discover the land of opportunity. It's a great country, Mr. Testi, if you know who to step on. That's not very patriotic. I'm not in the red, white and blue business. I prefer the color green. [CHUCKLES] You hear that, Carlo? The color green. CARLO: I've heard enough. I'll be upstairs. TESTI: Please excuse Carlo's rudeness. He turned an ankle playing tennis today. He's been so, how can I say... testy. Heh, heh. So from your reputation, I'd be a fool not to do business with you. There are others. But I'm told Joseph Bonnet knows the people who really control this country. Those who control the borders. Nothing gets in or out without their permission. And I gather these people also like the color green. Let's not waste each other's time. If you want in, I'm the man with the key. Are you normally this arrogant? I just tell the truth. Always? Every single time. Then tell me, which alphabet soup do you really work for, DEA, FBI, or CIA? [CHUCKLES] I work for myself, Mr. Testi. After that, I work for the highest bidder. And if that's me? You've hired the best. Just tell me what you want and watch how fast you get it. Let's you and I take a drive. TESTI: It's good to be away. In Barcelona, there's no one left for me to trust. The fact is, I don't trust Carlo, my own brother. Heh. He scares me sometimes. I'd like to put you with some people I know you could trust. They look after each other. What if I told you I wasn't in L.A. to expand my business? I'd tell you to stop the car and let me out. What if I told you I had another proposition? You better tell me something. I'm not known for my patience. I've worked hard. Perhaps I'm looking to simplify my life now, not complicate it further. You're talking about retirement. And we have nothing to talk about. Mr. Bonnet, please relax. We're getting to know each other here. Enjoy the ride. We'll talk more later. Ahem. Where are we going? Ha! To the theater.

Well, we can cancel my bungee jumping lesson. Big day today, gonna introduce you to a new friend. Another needle? I tell all my patients to give it a name. Just like a dog, it's gonna be your best friend. [♪♪♪♪♪] Hand to God. Now let me show you how she works. Uh... maybe a little later, Robert. Yeah, that is no problem. I'll just leave it here. We can get to things later, Mr. Bonnet. [CROWD CHATTERING] I'm looking for the patient in 328. He wasn't in his room. See, over there. Thank you. [♪♪♪♪♪] Hello, Nick. [SIGHS] First time I've heard my real name in a while. Sorry, Testi had people watchin' your room till yesterday. It's been over a month. Hey, I'm sorry. I'm not very good at this sort of thing. It's terrible what happened to you. Yeah, yeah. What about my request? They denied it. I gave them one more. Why can't they give me one more? You going back in the field like that, that's totally against policy. What am I supposed to do? They assured me you'd get full pension and benefits. Benefits, yeah, and handicapped parking. You didn't really expect-- I didn't expect some snot-nosed intern to tell me I'd never walk again. You want back in, maybe we can find you some less strenuous duty. Look, I swam a mile in the therapy pool this morning. I can handle something other than a desk job. It's not gonna happen. Forget it. What about Aldo Testi? The consulate in Barcelona is working with us on it. You know who shot me? Testi's brother Carlo. Carlo? Why? Apparently, Carlo disagreed with his brother about entering the American marketplace. Why did he shoot me? I don't know. Was I set up? Don't know that either. Why would Testi ask me-- We're working on it! Nick, we're working on it. Testi hit back hard. The Barcelona police fished Carlo out of the harbor a couple weeks ago. These two bobbed up the next day. They were his muscle at that strip joint that night. When I met Testi, he was talking about getting out of Barcelona, not into the American marketplace. Carlo had nothing to do with it. So noted. I'll pass it on. Look, my cover is still intact, just let me fly to Barcelona and find out-- Don't make this anymore difficult than it is. I've told you, the consulate over there is working with us on it. Turn the page. Move forward. I can't move forward. I can't move. Until I put this behind me, I can't move one inch. You got that? Not one inch. All right, let go of me, Nick. All right, there's no way I'm ever gonna understand what you're going through, I realize that, but I told you, the Testi case is under control, and as far as you're concerned, it is off limits. You know me better than that, Tom. I might be stuck in this chair, but I am not gonna sit this one out. Now, you send me a Christmas card, all right? [♪♪♪♪♪] [PLAYING MELANCHOLY BALLAD] [♪♪♪♪♪] [SIGHS] [PHONE RINGING] [RINGING CONTINUES] NARRATOR [ON TV]: Ocean currents that move away from the equator are warm currents, as opposed to those cool currents that move toward the equator.

You know, Nick, if you'd let me take you down to the gym and start working you out... Don't start that speech again. ...you could be doing your own damn shopping. Come on, the tape. I felt sorry for you the first few weeks, but now I'm bored with you, buddy. Come on, come on, the tape. I had to pull strings for that tape. Told 'em it was official business. That ought to get me fired, but hey, anything for a friend, right? Besides, I can always get another job. I hear they need a crossing guard down at my kid's school. Ah, maybe you shouldn't watch that stuff alone, Nick. I had the lab enhance the image. That son of a bitch. Play it back. KEN: Tell you anything? NICK: No, nothing new. KEN: I'm sorry Testi killed his brother. I would've liked a few minutes with him. You are having chicken à la king tonight, my man. This one comes with hot apple cobbler. They don't make cobbler like they did back when we were in high school. They don't make anything like they did in those days. I mean, really. What ever happened to white tennis balls? Or music you could dance to? Or TV shows that were better than the commercials? Hey, for that matter, what ever happened to Colleen Kayna? Remember her, Nicky, Coleen "you could look but not touch" Kayna? No sir, they sure don't make things like they did-- It wasn't Testi's brother. What's that? It wasn't Testi's brother, Carlo. He had a bad limp that night. Check this out. What are you talking about, man? Come on, come on. KEN: This jerk has two good legs. So would I if it weren't for him. KEN: If that's not Testi's brother, then who is it? I don't know, but I'm gonna find out if it's the last thing I do. MAN: Come on, come on, look for the open man! Look for the open man! Good one! Good one! Yeah! Come on, lay it up. Good pass! Good pass! That's him in the white shirt. One-on-one, there's nobody on wheels who can beat him. MAN: Dribble that ball! There you go!

[MEN LAUGHING AND CHATTERING] WHEELER: Whoa! Not bad, not bad. If it's the last thing I do. [♪♪♪♪♪] [WOMAN ON PA SPEAKING IN SPANISH] WOMAN [ON PA]: Now arriving at Gate 14, World Airlines flight 308 from Washington, D.C. Thank you. Mr. Bonnet? Yes? I'm Countess Rossetti. Thank you for meeting me. Mr. Testi was delighted by your fax. He was grateful to learn you survived the accident. Well, half of me, anyway. He said it was a head-on collision. I'd say more like a hit-and-run. What an ordeal. This car will be at your disposal night and day. Finding one's way in Barcelona can sometimes be difficult. [SPEAKING IN SPANISH] [DOOR CLOSES] Well, as you're exhausted from the trip, Señor Testi has invited you for dinner. Afterwards, he was hoping you would accompany him to his casino. I'll look forward to it. So will I. Well, I hope you-- You'll enjoy your stay here and that it will be a comfortable one. Well, it already is. Dinner's at 9. Until then. [DOOR OPENS THEN CLOSES] [OPERATOR SPEAKS SPANISH] American consulate, por favor. MAN: Nick Suster? Yeah. Adam Vincent. I got your message. I'm sure you could understand my wanting to meet away from the consulate. The bureau warned me you might be foolish enough to come over here. I'm supposed to report you. I was hoping for your cooperation. It doesn't work that way, and you know it. I didn't have to contact you. Testi's agreed to meet with me tonight. I think I can still find out what he's up to. Bull. You're here for personal reasons, for revenge, and Washington's not going to allow it. I'm not asking Washington, I'm asking you. I've always heard that Adam Vincent made up his own mind. All right, I don't buy the company's version of why I was shot. But I'm not some loose cannon. You give me a little help and a couple of days, and I'll give you Testi on a platter with all the dressing. I'm not guaranteeing anything but meet me at the Picasso Museum in an hour. Washington could fire me for this. Don't worry about Washington. If you hand them Testi, they'll hand you a promotion. WOMAN: No! No! No! No! My purse! My purse! They're taking my purse! [CROWD CLAMORING] [BOTH GRUNT] Oh. Thank you. Thank you. Let me give you something. Would a hundred be okay? No, it's not necessary. Maybe my friend here? No. You're heroes. Bless you both. We made a pretty good team. Yeah, we ought to celebrate. I could use a drink. I'd love a drink. Good. But I'm broke. You're broke? You just turned down a tip. Some things you do for the soul. Besides, I want people to remember my city with a smile. I'm buying. My lucky lighter strikes the first time every time. Sounds like a commercial. Hmm. A young lady gave it to me when I was on leave. You in the army? Uh-uh. Navy. You were in Desert Storm. We were on call. Six months of training but you guys finished it before we had a chance to show our stuff. All dressed up and no place to go. So, what do you do now? Med school by night, courier by day. I'm paying my own way. How about you? Well, I used to be in the law enforcement business before, uh, this. The name is Nick by the way. Nick Suster. Jordi Torres. Jordi, I'm sort of new at asking for help but I could use some. What kind of help? Well, I'm in Barcelona to put away some bad guys. I mean, really bad guys. I'm not talking about purse snatchers. I mean the major leagues. Sounds exciting but dangerous. Yeah, well, it will be. And if you can run some errands for me, I can give you a thousand bucks towards your tuition. Wow. That's a lot of classes. Okay, I'll do what I can. Oh, great. What's first? What's first? First, I want you to get some nice clothes. Meet me tonight at the Casino Paradise. Hey! Easy, champ. And I'll need a car, a very special car. Here are the specs. Piece of cake. Good. That's great. I really appreciate this. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have another appointment. Oh, uh... And I'll need the meanest handgun you can find. ADAM: The woman you are about to meet is an assistant curator here. She is also a secret agent for the Catalan police. Any information you feel is relevant routes through her. You are not to contact me directly. I understand. You can sniff around Testi. No one takes a bite without my say so. I understand. Nuria Casteres, please. One moment. And if you turn this into some gonzo payback mission, you'll be on a plane home so fast, it'll make your chair spin. Hello, Mr. Vincent. ADAM: Nuria Casteres, meet Nick Suster. How do you do? NICK: Hello. ADAM: Nuria has been briefed. I'll give you three days. No more. So you're a Catalan, Mr. Suster. On my father's side. First time in Barcelona? First time in Spain. Well, I hope you'll find time to enjoy it. Is there anything that I can do for you now? I need to know if Aldo Testi and his brother Carlo were at war. It's common knowledge. Or why would have Aldo have killed Carlo? I don't think he did. I'll see what I can find out. Anything else? I could use a cab back to the Ritz Hotel. It's this way. I'll show you. The second number is my home. Mr. Vincent doesn't seem to trust you. I guess not, he didn't give me his home number. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Good evening. Nice house. Where's the gift shop? You should see our villa in Rome. TESTI: Your news brings me the greatest displeasure. LOUIS: I certainly didn't intend to upset your evening. TESTI: And, now, as you see, comisario, I have business to attend to. Of course. I'm Louis Alville. Detective, Spanish National Police. Joseph Bonnet, nice to meet you. Oh! An American. Are you also in the import/export business? I believe you know the way out, comisario. I just told Señor Testi of a large narcotic shipment we intercepted at the port this morning, thanks to an anonymous tip. I thought someone so involved in the waterfront would wish to know of our success. Angela, show the comisario to the door. Whoever it was responsible for today's shipment, I'll see to it they'll rot in prison for the rest of their lives. That's enough! LOUIS: I will let you know the weight and value of the heroin seized. Though if I told you one, I'm sure you'll know the other. [DOOR CLOSES] Angela, change into something else. This hides too much. Mr. Bonnet, come with me. I'm glad to see that you're alive, but not in this way. It's an adjustment, I'll tell you that much. It is all my fault. I'll do any favor I can for you. I only want two things, Mr. Testi. First, I want your business. I'm surprised you're still interested in doing business with me. Let's just say I have some unexpected doctor bills to pay. I was prepared to do business with you in Los Angeles, and I still am. What's the second thing you want? I want to know who shot me. I was pleased to give you justice in that regard. I don't believe you killed your brother. And I don't believe he's the one that tried to kill me. He did. And I personally chopped off his trigger finger before having him shot. Then you made a bad mistake. Mr. Bonnet, I understand your frustration. But please, for your own sake, you must believe me. Better. Dinner is served. Splendid! Tomorrow morning, I'd like you to view my properties in Barcelona. The Countess Rosetti will take you on a tour. NICK: If the countess doesn't mind. ANGELA: No, not at all. [PHONE RINGING] Please accept my hospitality. Hospitality or charity? I'll use my own money. Thanks. I understand. But if there's anything you need... There's a phone call for you, Señor Testi. Not now. It's Mr. Volkner. Excuse me a moment. [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] [SPEAKS IN SPANISH] Gracias. [ALL CHATTERING] NURIA: You're hotel said you'd be here. Ms. Casteres. It's Nuria. And I've got some answers for you. This way. Most people, even the police, are tight-lipped about this thing. They fear repercussions. The bureau called him the Magician. He was very good at making witnesses, evidence, court charges all disappear. Apparently, Testi and his brother did disagree on how to run their shipping empire. But they weren't at war. Word is, the Testi is looking for one last score so that the family can get out for good. He'd already made a down payment on an island for Carlo. Does the family have any enemies? The Volkners. Volkner? The Testis and the Volkners have been in a power struggle for three generations. No one can get them to sit down for peace talks. That's strange. He just took a phone call from a Mr. Volkner. You'd better go. You know where to find me, Mr. Suster. It's Nick. Thanks. Ah! There you are. You must forgive me this evening. I've got to leave soon. Some business has come up. Certainly. Let me know what you think of your tour tomorrow. I'm curious what kind of dollars my holdings could bring. Should I ever decide to sell. You'll have my estimate tomorrow night. Who's he? Aldo Testi. Sounds like a sports car. I want you to follow him. If he goes anywhere interesting, I want you to call me at the hotel no matter what the hour. You got it. How'd you make out with the car? Oh, it's in the lot. Here's the key. Good work. What about the gun? I got you a revolver. What kind of revolver? A very big revolver. Jeez! Where did--? Don't ask. But make sure you set the brake on your chair or you'll take off like a rocket. All right, Testi's leaving. Don't lose sight of him. [♪♪♪♪♪] [LINE RINGING] NICK: Yeah. Oh, you said to call at any hour. Yeah, Jordi, where are you? I followed him into a warehouse down on the docks. What's he doing? Just talking and waiting. Waiting for what? Waiting for a guy named Volkner. All right, give me the directions. Fast. [♪♪♪♪♪] They're still in there. Thanks. You should go home and get some sleep. No, I'm not leaving you here alone. No way. All right, Jordi. You think you can get me up on that roof? I think you should go home and get some sleep. Oh, come on. You can do it. Okay. We'll try. Wheels up, captain. [WOMEN LAUGHING] NICK: Stay down. NICK: That must be Volkner. [WOMEN LAUGHING] [♪♪♪♪♪] VOLKNER: Oh! I see you have made yourselves at home. TESTI: Nobody keeps me waiting half the night. But that's not true, old man. I just did. Besides, the night is still young. We haven't even been dancing. Let's get to it. If the police seized another shipment of mine tonight, that's two in one day. So my sources tell me. It was you who tipped them off. Why do you do this? Punishment. You promised that you would sell out to me. And now my sources report that you are seeing the American again. I've warned you in L.A. not to look for any other buyers. I get really jealous, Chicky. Chicky. That's the guy who shot me. TESTI: You're a fool. My relationship with Bonnet has nothing to do with business. It is purely personal. That's not what my sources say. Screw your sources! Look, we'll be free of each other as soon as my scientist arrives from Paris. Until then, let's just get through this deal. Because whether we like it or not, neither one of us can pull it off without the other. My supplies, your ships. Who would think Testi and Volkner would ever be doing business together? I guess that is why it is such a good cover. In 48 hours, we'll cash in on the biggest payday either of us will ever know. Blow it and I'll kill you myself. [LAUGHS] Oh, you know, that's funny. Because I was going to say the same thing. Sleep then, Chicky. [LAUGHING] [WOMEN GIGGLING] [♪♪♪♪♪] Have a look inside. What's that? Ooh, a little something I brought from home. Let's see your lucky lighter. Hey, you're right, it lights the first time every time. Let's go. [MAN SHOUTING IN SPANISH] Give me your gun. Wait a minute. I'll meet you in the car. [♪♪♪♪♪] Whoo! [BULLETS RICOCHETING] [♪♪♪♪♪] [GRUNTS] NICK: Come on. Come on. Come on, sparks, do your stuff. Get back! [MEN SCREAMING] I didn't have time to ask. Did you enjoy your swim? Very refreshing. Thanks for going in for the chair. I've got to tell you, this nasty gun of yours worked like a charm. I wish I could say the same for your lucky lighter. The empty crates in the warehouse, what do you think was in them? Parts for making missiles. Missiles? Big time missiles. I wonder where all the parts are now? That's what I want you to find out. I'll get on it first thing in the morning. Jordi, it is first thing in the morning. Get on it. I need to see Vincent. What happened to good morning? Good morning. I need to see Vincent. He'll want to know why. It always comes down to trust, doesn't it? Tell him I found the makings for World War III in a warehouse down at the docks. Americans are so melodramatic. I'm being picked up at 9:00 for a tour of the city. Make sure he gets in touch with me before then. Do you want fries with that order? [CHUCKLES] [BOTH CHUCKLE] Yeah, yeah. I needed that. It's been a long night. It's been a lot of long nights. Thanks. Anytime. I'll be at my hotel. [♪♪♪♪♪] Nick. Good morning. [♪♪♪♪♪] [PHONE RINGING] Hello. ANGELA: I am in the lobby. Yes, countess, good morning. I'll be right down. NURIA: Nuria Casteres. It's Nick. No one has called. I'm sorry but I did deliver your message piping hot. I've got to go out. I'll be back as soon as I can. You tell Vincent to get off his butt. I'll tell him you said "please." Bye, Nick. [♪♪♪♪♪] NICK: I'm quite impressed with Mr. Testi's holdings in Barcelona. ANGELA: And Madrid and Sevilla. I should show you someday. What exactly do you do for Mr. Testi? Don't be coy. I make him happy. Something money can't buy, right? You tell me. My job pays quite well. And, yes, money makes me very happy. Money, not Mr. Testi. You're on dangerous ground. I'll take my chances. Aldo's idea of a good time is getting tanned in Majorca. Which you don't like, a tan line or Majorca? ANGELA: Heh-heh. I don't like laying in a lounge chair for the rest of my life. NICK: What do you like? Let's just say, everybody has a price, Mr. Bonnet. What if someone were willing to offer more? You never know. [LINE RINGING] Ciao. Thanks for taking the time. We can take more. Well, I suppose I'm still a little jetlagged. Maybe tomorrow. Maybe we could go over these spreadsheets together. Sure. I'm usually real good at spreadsheets. Hello. Barcelona police? My name is Joseph Bonnet. I'm in Suite 108 at the Ritz Hotel. Please tell Detective Alville that I wish to confess to a murder. Sorry for the delay. No time for excuses. Follow me. Damon. Your other boss would like to see you. It's kind of an emergency. Where? Here at the hotel. You know a guy named Volkner? Volkner, yeah. Testi's number one rival. He majors in terrorism. The two of them are doing a deal together. Looks like Volkner's supplying the parts to some MD-660 missiles. Testi's providing the waterways to ship the parts in and the final products out. MD-660s. They're designed to carry biochemical warfare. I don't know who the clients are, or where the missiles are being assembled, but Testi has a man coming in from Paris to put the parts together in the next 24 hours. How do you know all this? Do you really want to stand around discussing that while God knows how many warheads could be across the street? I know it. That's all that matters. Let me tell you something. Every time you pop off like this, you damage your credibility. You can't chance my being wrong. This has become more than nailing Testi. It's now about risking the lives of millions of people. You go ahead and worry about my credibility. I've got missiles to find. [♪♪♪♪♪] [SIRENS APPROACHING] [SIRENS WAILING] [♪♪♪♪♪] NICK: I could use another laugh. If not a drink. Did you see Vincent? Yeah. What's the matter? Oh, nothing, really. Except I fell into a Volkner trap. He's got the police looking for me. They think I killed the countess. And let's see. Let's not forget about those pesky missiles hidden somewhere in the city, and, oh, if you hadn't noticed, I can't walk. When did it all go wrong? When Adam met Eve. What can I do, Nick? I could use some company. I thought you'd never ask. [SPEAKS IN SPANISH] I have salad stuck in my teeth? No, to your health. Yeah, that's me, the picture of health. I'm sorry. Ahem. No, I am. I'm sorry you don't see yourself the way I see you. Well, I see a guy stuck in a chair. I felt stuck in a chair after my husband died, but I had to find the reasons within me to live again. Maybe I should go. No. Maybe you should look within yourself at the reasons you've come to Barcelona. I, uh, came to find the guy that did this to me. No. You've come to find yourself. To see how much was taken away the night he shot you. Whatever. I'm still stuck in this chair. Unless you find the reasons within you to get unstuck. What? Can you still be interested in a woman, Nick? The difficult part is believing that... That a woman could still be interested in me. Does this help? [♪♪♪♪♪] [♪♪♪♪♪] I never thought I could feel this way again. Neither did I. [♪♪♪♪♪] [♪♪♪♪♪] [DOORBELL RINGS] [DOORBELL RINGS] [DOORBELL RINGS] [DOORBELL RINGS] We found Suster's car at the museum. We thought you may have heard from him. ADAM: Sorry I disturbed you. I'm sure you were conducting official business. What's going on? Washington's taking your missile theory pretty seriously. They want you to report to the Spanish National Police right away. We got a sticky problem there. I'm wanted for the murder of Testi's mistress. We know, we're working on it. Why'd you do it? Just kidding. Any idea who did? Volkner. Smart money says he killed Testi's brother too. ADAM: But why? NICK: Three reasons. First, throw the police off the track to make it look like Testi and Carlos were feuding. Second, create some havoc so that he could take over the waterfront while the Testis were off balance. Mmm. Third? Third, he's just plain nuts. Why didn't Volkner simply shoot Testi? NICK: He couldn't. They're joined at the hip over this missile deal. You have any idea who the client is yet? ADAM: We're stumped. We don't know whether they want the weapons for blackmail, or if they're actually intending to fire them at someone. I'll tell you one thing. Human beings. One overrated species. If we find the missiles, chances are we'll find the buyer. Not a bad package if we can deliver it. [♪♪♪♪♪] How typically American. You operate on your own without consideration for others. Then, at the last second. you tell them what they should do. The situation's taken us by surprise, detective. We didn't have all the information ourselves until today, but as soon as we did, we came directly to you. Did the information include that your Mr. Suster here, alias Joseph Bonnet, is wanted for murder? ADAM: Aw, come on. You know very well he had nothing to do with that. I do. But unlike you, I work with other people. We have procedures. NICK: We don't have time for procedures. Volkner set me up and I can prove it. I can also prove it was his bullet they pulled out of my spine. I'm afraid you'll have to prove it from jail. Please. LOUIS: There is no way they'll let you out of this building. Please hear me out. The Countess might have been sleeping with Testi, but she was working for Volkner. Then why did he kill her? We have an old saying around the office: Spies who know too much don't live too long. Well, we have an old saying around this office: No one is released outside the proper channels. My hands are tied. [KNOCK ON DOOR] Excuse me, but there's someone here to see you, sir. Tom McCall, FBI. I need to talk to you. Nick, Adam. I'm not exaggerating when I say this Testi-Volkner deal has reached international proportions. I feel I'm being ganged up on. No, no, on the contrary. Detective, we need your help. Neither one of us can get these guys alone. You're the best equipped to deal with this situation in the time that's left. You can control the logistics. You've got an effective anti-terrorist unit. LOUIS: Only I must first persuade Mr. Testi to tell me where the missiles are. A very simple thing. NICK: If you'll hear a suggestion in that regard. I still have access to Testi. I think I could get some answers out of him. TOM: Now wait a minute, Nick, Testi thinks you just killed his mistress. You are willing to incur such danger? Well, let's just say that, uh, some things you do for the soul. Perhaps I can work something out. Merry Christmas. And peace on earth. [♪♪♪♪♪] I feel I let you down. NICK: Ah, you did great. Just great. Except for finding the missiles. I want to go with you to Testi's. Things could get out of hand. Jordi, what's left is something you can't help me with. Oh, uh... Thanks. Thanks for everything. But you've already paid me. Consider it a bonus. It's been a lucky trip so far. I won that back and I met you. [CHUCKLES] You consider it a bonus. I'll consider it a retainer. I'm still on call 24 hours. Sure. [DOORBELL RINGS] [SPEAKS IN SPANISH] Good luck, friend. They asked me to bring this. Want to wire me for sound? Could be fun. Why is it you who's going? Well, maybe they think I'm the best man for the job. Everybody makes mistakes. Nuria, look, hey. I can do this. I need to do this. Please understand. [♪♪♪♪♪] [♪♪♪♪♪] [GUNSHOT] [GROANS] [SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY] WOMAN [ON INTERCOM]: Mr. Bonnet is here to see you. Splendid. [GUN COCKS] [PHONE RINGING] Yes. MAN: Ja, the missile expert is ours. Oh, good. Now that we have the scientist, I guess you no longer need your partner. [PHONE HANGS UP] I appreciate you seeing me. Before you say anything, don't worry, I know you didn't kill the countess. Well, that's a relief. But every cop in Barcelona's looking for me. [OVER RADIO] And you once said that if I ever needed a favor... TESTI: I'll smuggle you back to America on one of my ships. After that, you're on your own. Now I'm afraid I must run off. That's very kind of you, but one more thing before you go. Yes. Where are the missiles? Now, now, Mr. Bonnet. Put the gun away, so we can cut a deal here. What do you say to a brandy? I say if you push that button I'll pull this trigger. Now why don't you and I talk about missiles. I simply don't know what you're talking about, Mr. Bonnet. [LAUGHS] So you might as well shoot me. Sleep well, Chicky. WOMAN: Oh, my God! What's going on? MAN: Call an ambulance! Volkner. Volkner! NICK: The missiles. The missiles. Pier 12. [GRUNTS] [♪♪♪♪♪] [MEN CHATTERING OVER RADIO] TOM: This Volkner character's a classy guy. He kills the countess and steals her Mercedes. LOUIS: We think the man Volkner is shaking hands with is the buyer. TOM: I'd say we're looking at about two tons worth of biochemical materials. ADAM: Forget that this is a zillion dollar deal. Look at the potential genocide here. TOM: And this could be the last piece of the puzzle if it's Testi's missile expert. Let's see. TOM: And...bingo. There he is. Detective Alville, it's your show. [SPEAKS IN SPANISH] Go like hell. [SIRENS WAILING] [GUNFIRE] [SHOUTING IN SPANISH] [SHOUTS IN SPANISH] [♪♪♪♪♪] LOUIS: All units, hold your fire. Assault 1, bring in the chopper. [SCREAMS] TOM: Well, gentlemen, I believe the fat lady has sung. It's over. Quite a show. Wouldn't you say, Nick? [ELEVATOR DINGS] [ALL CHATTERING] [SIREN WAILING] TOM: We got the buyer, Testi, Volkner. Not a bad day's work. I would have liked for you to have seen Volkner's body. Might have helped you move forward. I'd have derived some satisfaction seeing that myself. He was the only one wearing a flak jacket. Oh, hell, flak jacket or not. The concussion alone would have killed him. No, the divers will bring him up at first light. We'll come back. You know, Nick, you brought something pretty big down here. Almost single-handedly. I wouldn't be surprised if the Bureau doesn't review its own policies. Well, I hope they do, but I'm not joining up again. It is time to move forward. Not back. Well, anyway, you decide to go on your own I'd throw as much international work your way as I could. Wouldn't be a bad way to see the world, would it? Well, I guess, I for one, owe you some apologies. And some thanks. Neither are necessary. Both are appreciated. JORDI: Wait a minute. Wait a minute, let me go. I'm on professional retainer to this man. He was sneaking around inside the police cordon. It's okay, I know him. Time to have a look at the spoils. What are you doing here? The radio was full of the harbor being closed. I put two and two together. Come with me. [♪♪♪♪♪] JORDI: You see? That blood leads to that shack. It's Volkner's. NICK: How do you know? JORDI: I saw him. He may be dead by now. You want me to come with you? No. Trust me, you never fired anything like this. Remember to set your brake. Get the others. [♪♪♪♪♪] [CLATTERING] [NICK GROANS] [♪♪♪♪♪] [GUN CLICKING] [GUN COCKS] Get it over with! Look at me! Just kill me, damn it! You are torturing me! Torture? I haven't even begun. You see, the bad news is, you're going to live. You're going to spend the rest of your life in jail, and then one night, I'm gonna come pay you a visit. I'm gonna come into your cell, and I'll wake you up. Then I'm gonna shoot you in both legs. One night. And you're never gonna know when. Now that's torture. So sleep well, Chicky. [♪♪♪♪♪] So now what? I was thinking about ordering dinner. I mean after dinner. After tomorrow and the day after that. What then? I haven't really made any plans. Will you be going home? I guess, eventually. Got an apartment there, family, friends. Anyone else? No, no one else. You know, I met a guy not long ago named Wheeler. He had this bumper sticker on the back of his wheelchair. It said, "Wherever you go, there you are." You helped me, Nuria, to finally understand what that means. You helped me realize that, I may have wheels instead of legs, but by God, Nick Suster's still here. I'll never forget how much you helped me. You helped yourself. But thanks. How soon then will you leave? Well, I thought I'd see a little of Spain first. Learn about my heritage, the culture, the language. I promised my grandpa. Nick... Could I show you Spain? I thought you'd never ask. [♪♪♪♪♪] [♪♪♪♪♪]
