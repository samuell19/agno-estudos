New world record, set by Misha Averin! Mum! I held 57 seconds! Pretty. In bed! Not in bed! It's late. Misha! Misha, it's not funny. Not in bed! Mikhail, catch him! Not in bed! Come here! On the sofa! That's enough. Go kiss my mom. She's tired. In bed! Hello. It is all I have. -Thank you Sergei, he will be touched. Slowly! Its good. I'm sorry, gentlemen. We received nothing from Moscow. What are we supposed to live from? If I knew it, I would live it too. You go to sea, you will have a bonus. We will not be paid. Pavel! We must go, go back! Sergei gave us 800. She added stuff. -What? She added stuff! If there is not the whole list, she kills me. 4 cases of vodka more, 5 beer, 18 crepon rolls, balloons, champagne! Shit! Cancel everything! Or marry me. Who has our money? What? Who has our money? -Anton! We do not have enough, far from it. It will be fine. Oleg! I would marry myself. -Shut up. Serious. I would be the ideal wife. -Shut up! Give me the list. That's what we need. And money. There is a lack of it. Drop. You will have the balance in a week or two, promised. Must pay cash. My best friend is getting married. The debate is closed. You are serious? To death. I can not believe. No, Mikhail. Do you see that? So? A submariner's watch. Something else? Shoes? Jackets? Underwear? Great. It looks nice. She will be happy. Can we have vodka? This is my watch we drink. Do we have dinner right now or are we waiting? Where is your watch? It's a long story. We are all a bit naked. Where are they? -We sold them. Sold? But why? For that and that... And that and that! And all the rest! Really? -We bought everything. Thank you. -You're welcome! Oleg, what do you have? -You cry? Look at him, he chides! He chides! -But no! I'm not fine? Stop crying! Let's go eat. -Yes let's go. Oleg! Stop, you'll make me cry. Go Oleg, it's good! For my wife, a drink. It is perhaps the desolation of this land that brings us together, but clearly, we are united. And tonight, Pavel and Daria are united. As Pavel's best friend... Who's crying now? Shut up! Me? I said nothing. As Pavel's best friend, I would like to make a toast. To Pavel and Daria, and to their half-dozen children who will take care of uncle Anton, when I am old. I raise my glass to Daria. My sweet Tania will testify, the life of a sailor's wife is not easy. Life here in the Northern Fleet is even harder So imagine being married to Pavel... on top of that. Imagine the torture! But we get used to it. And when everything goes wrong, what are we doing? The band of sailors, the band of sailors Here is my heart and here is my hand It's clear, it's clear It's time to take a drink... A kiss! One. Two, three four, five six... Twenty! I can sit alone. You're my best friend. -I know. Where is your wife? Congratulations! Ten years of happiness! It's twenty, not ten! Come with me. What are you doing? Do you want to go next? Stopped. You feel it? Yes. Sleep well my love. Sleep well, my eternal. Hello chef! Hello! Ready to go fishing? Chief, what are you on TV? Tricks that do not laugh. Hold on. Slowly. Its good. -We did it. Did they start it? -I dunno. Aleksei, what's going on? Must play sports. -Shut up. Aleksei, how are you? -Great. We were there, in Moscow. You hear? No leave it! Leave the music. I just love it! Pavel! Always married after 24 hours? So far, so good. You got a joke that she's cool. So, it's the famous Fat Girl? She's sweating. She is angry? 130 degrees. It stays in the norms. Not angry, but annoyed. Reactor three-quarters of its maximum power. Normal temperature and pressure. Turbine generators trimmed to port and starboard. Main engines trimmed. Propulsion team ready. Checking the posts at the port? Parried and transmitted to maneuvers. Watch for the rear hydraulic system. Verification of the instruments? -Made. The Kursk is leaving! -Quick! Wait for me! They go away! Do not hang around! The first to arrive! Quick! Wait for me! Goodbye! Goodbye, dad! He is coming. Warning. The admiral is on the bridge! Rest. Coffee. Synchronize the frigates. North Cape 16.5. At your service. I have to do everything myself? No, admiral. What a grandiose sight! 20 years ago, for the same exercise, we had three times more ships. Today, we let them rust in dry dock. We're bailing our submarines to get the parts back. Do you remember Kutusov? My first command. He was relieved of his missiles and now delivers meat and vegetables to the Poliarny base. If the Americans attack us, Koutousov will be able to swing them cabbages. It's still impressive. It is a resounding message to our enemies. It remains to be determined who our enemies are. Rear Admiral Russell. General Officer assigned to submarines. Thank you. So, this Russian exercise? 57 surface ships and 3 submarines detected. An Oscar-II, the Kursk, left Vidiaievo at 07.20. Acoustic? Silence and invisibility. An Oscar! Fortunately, they can not afford to build it anymore. The Typhoons, we heard them, it avoided collisions. In time, the Russians were doing one a year, you imagine? Hello. Admiral Gruzinsky is one? -To the maneuver. You know each other, do not you? We met. We fished together. And drunk. Too much, as far as I'm concerned. So, Admiral Gruzinsky. What do you reserve us? Chief officer of the watch, dive 28 m. 085 to starboard. Once the pace has stabilized, increase to 20 knots. 28 m, 085, 20 knots. Armament? 24 SS-16 missiles, 21 L-55 torpedoes and an HP drive torpedo. The Fat Girl? Situation? -Stable. I hate HP. Cheap and dangerous. 135. I have more shows. I can not wait to get rid of it. Take care of yourself! Rest. The exercise will consist of three steps. Shot of the training missile. Shot of the training torpedo. Back to the base without being detected. State of the reactors? Both reactors are ready. Armament? The training torpedo is stable, but its internal temperature is slightly high, sign of a potential leak of hydrogen peroxide. Noted. We will get rid of it as soon as the shot is allowed. Something else? -No. At work. Clear tube. Ready to load. The temperature is a peak. 142 and it climbs. Call priority, pass me the commander. Here the commander. The torpedo is angry. 142 and it continues to climb. 148. Do you allow me to shoot before the shooting window? Are we under the threshold of tolerance? Yes, commander. The shooting window is in 7 min. We are not in position. Permission denied. At your service. It is procedural. 152. We only have to pray. I am not a believer. Secure the compartment. Close the airlock. Close the valves! Secure the front partition. Close the doors and the valves. PC, here compartment 7, answer! Why does not it answer? -They are dead. Shut up. Do not we go back? -In your opinion? Shut up! PC, here compartment 7, answer. Chief, fire torpedo room. Detonation temperature? It seems to me that the warheads explode at 180 ?. For how much? At 180 ?. We are off the counter. How do we do? As in training, secure... Rearward! Compartment 9! Pavel and Anton are in the front. Go to compartment 9. Leave it on the platform, go to compartment 9. Come on! Anton! Compartment 5, here compartment 7, answer. Compartment 5, here compartment 7, answer. Mikhail, they are dead. You have to shoot yourself. We're off! Here compartment 5. Mikhail? Anton, we are at 7. Situation? The reactor is melting. The cooling is no longer done. Get out of there. If we leave, it will be a 2nd Chernobyl. You must turn on the convection mode. Water level? It's rising. Quick. Mikhail? Tell Vera that I love her. Goodbye. Goodbye. Come on! All at compartment 9! There is someone? Go! To fart! Do not go out! Advance! Leo, come on. Let go of me! Wake up! Help me. Monte! We know what happened? Not really. How did we survive? We are in the back. That's how. As it exploded in the front, the armored partitions protected us. What are we doing? We go out through the airlock and get out. We take the water. No, we proceed in order. First, we stabilize the compartment and make an inventory of our reserves. And after, we study evacuation solutions. Does everyone understand? -Yes sir! Very well. Maxim and Niko, Seal the compartment and bleed the main hoses. Then, evaluate the house from front to back. Boris, take care of the pump. Where are you? Take the hammer to let them know that we are alive. Several sequences of 4 shots, at full hours. Four shots. Close-up of the Barents Sea, north-east of Murmansk. Display the maritime traffic. Right now. Let's find a clearer satellite image. Tighten. What is that? So? Russian frigates crisscross the area. The other ships circle it. "Seismic events." Specify. A 1st minor, a major. 3.9 on the Richter scale. At 11:28 am Two minutes apart For God Sake! They lost a submarine. Find Norsar Seismic Indices for the area. That the US deviate the Satcom 3 to photograph Vidiaievo and the secondary ports of Murmansk. Bruce... Call the Northern Fleet HQ. Who? -Admiral Gruzinsky. I have endorsed by NATO? If I wanted that, I would have told you. The admiral is on the bridge! -Rest! Report. Two acoustic events. How big? -Our instruments do not specify it. Locate and identify the boat. The Kursk? -Prepare the Dronov for a dive. Including? -Yes, admiral. What are we hearing? An explosion, then a second, which is actually a sum of simultaneous explosions. Granite missiles. Rather torpedoes. News from the Northern Fleet? -Always not. Survivors? There were two major explosions. US satellites show shore rescue equipment. Mum? Good or bad? They are small. But good. Put them in the basket. They are very small. Baby mushrooms. We will put them in the soup. Let's go. The water rises fast. We took 1,50 m. One does what one can. Pass me the key. We are missing rags! -Leo, rags! Go ahead! -Move! I'll go get some. Niko, quickly. I do not have. Does it move with the pump? Have to turn it. -I'm taking care of it. It is connected to the reserve batteries. Connected. Take some milk to test it. Give me the milk. Check that it sucks. It will slow down the rise of water but not stop it. Boris, make sure she turns. We still take the water. Yes sir. Niko, blankets to warm up. Prepare the oxygen generator. Do not start it, before we have seen the procedure together. Leo? Everything is fine? We will get out of this. -I'm not afraid. Listen to me carefully. Imagine yourself up there, with your friends here at the back. You would do everything to save them. You would go to the end. -Until the end. All we would do for them they will do it for us. Yes sir. -Do you believe me? It's okay? Yes sir. We have sound? Admiral, it does not work. We will have it repaired. We are almost there. My God! It's worse. Much worse than I imagined. Nobody can survive that. It's the Kursk. Something happened. What? -I'm sorry. Ilina! Mum! Hi. Anastasia! What is happening? -They lost contact. When? Since when? I dunno. He would be in flames. Who told you that? -Dacha. Danil's sister says that everything is fine. Are they trapped? -Who knows? What do we do? Find Vadim. I will go to inquire at the base. We find ourselves at Vera's place. Do not worry, we'll find out. Something happened to the Kursk? I am not at all aware. You have no news? Can not you tell me anything? Not if I know nothing. But even if I knew, I would not have the right to say it. Commander Tymoshenko! Commanding officer! There was a problem on the Kursk? I am here for a meeting. Excuse me. It would be a miracle if the navy played transparency. It's anything. What are we doing? We let the navy do its job. She will do everything possible to bring them back alive. We must know what is happening. Yes that's it. 30 years ago, while Anton was not even old enough to Misha, his father was working on Kiev. A fire broke out and the submarine remained at the bottom for three weeks. I was not aware of anything. The navy protected me while saving Vadim's life. The comrades will do their duty. Yours is to wait and hope. Coffee? I did not say goodbye to Anton when he left. I was angry. He had promised to replace the glass above the sink. I did not even kiss him. It may have been our last moment together. And I shouted at him. He knew that you loved him. He knew? He knows it. You must be strong. We must all be strong. We do not have a choice. Commanding officer! Misha, go sit down there. My name is Tanya Averina. -I know. I know Mikhail. This is our only rescue ship? If they were alive, you would already be at sea. I am sorry. Really. I got it. We have no more oxygen. The oxygen plant is dead. We must launch the generator. Oleg. We need cartridges to light it. Oleg. -I know. Shit! A problem? We do not have cartridges. We do not have any! There must be some. -We searched everywhere. They are somewhere. Yes sir. Compartment 8, in the lower part. I gave them to Timur. 8 is flooded. We can not access it anymore. Whore! Boris. Restart the pump. I will help you. Ready. Backup batteries. Notice to the fleet. Shut off all engines. Audio test confirmed. Let us hear what there is to hear. Shut off the engines. Affirmative. Fifteen seconds. It's the full time. Now! The audio works? Yes, ambient noise and current flow are detected. Nothing. The full hour. She has passed. What? The time has passed. You have to hit. Sorry, I sold my watch. Contact the Rudnitsky. Right now! Contact the Rudnitsky. Tanya Averina? I am Koulkin. They heard knocking on the hull of Kursk. Thank you. Marina! Daria! What? -They heard knocking! They heard knocking! You're sure? They are alive! They heard knocking. -What is going on? The lifeboat is going there. You're sure? -It is true? Yes! They are alive! I want the satellite direct from Vidiaievo and northeast of Murmansk. It's the Kursk that sank. A ship sailed 2 hours ago, equipped with a rescue submarine. So there are survivors. -What submersible? The Russians had three. The Mir was sold to an American box. It serves to show the wreck of the Titanic to wealthy tourists. $ 20.000 per visit. A-32 is blocked in the Black Sea, stabilizers in bulk. Rest the Priz, a bunch of bolts unworthy to navigate in a bathtub. The Russians asked for our help? My many calls to Admiral Gruzinsky have remained unanswered. But he's not crazy. Kursk is a jewel full of state secrets. Cryptography, propulsion, weapons. Not touch. We'll see. In the meantime, have the LR-5 ready for transport and register saturated divers in activity from here to Finland. Wait for me there. Hi. No. -Why? I said no. First, know that I will strive to the maximum to share all the information we have. But understand that for security reasons, certain information must remain confidential at this stage. So... The Russian navy, and especially the Northern Fleet, prides itself on its history in the service of the nation and its brave sailors... Commanding officer! Excuse me for interrupting. One would have heard hitting on the hull of Kursk. It is true? I have nothing to say about it. On the other hand, the Russian navy, and especially the Northern Fleet... He will not say anything. Sorry, Commander, but we're here to get some news. You have nothing to tell us? On the blows on the hull? -The state of the sailors? The oxygen reserves? -And the rescue operations? Tell us! How much time do they have left? -Say something! Please! I am sorry. Really sorry. I'm sorry, but I have nothing to add! Tell us! Please! -Commanding officer! You behaved badly. You have to trust them. I do not trust them. -It must! Excuse me... He's dead, dad? I dunno. Do you think he's dead? I hope he's fine. Me too. Niko. Wake up. You hear me? We must stay awake. Stay with us. You have to go through the lower airlock. -Impossible. It must. We need oxygen. You will not do it. Leo! Chief. What are they in? I left before he put them away. You do not know? -In the lower part. It will take time to find them. Who wants to come with me? Sacha? Come get the oxygen cartridges. Leo, get busy. It's insane. It's too far. Your arm. Come on, your arm. It's good. Help him! Take them out of the water! Bring blankets! Help me! Go! Look at me! Take it out! Go! Hold on, Sacha! Go! Sacha! It's okay? Look at me. Where are the cartridges? Two boxes. 10 cartridges per box. We grilled one. We have 19 left. You have taken time! Serious. Are you going back for my swimsuit? Watch out! Warning! Soft! Warning! Five men for the maneuver! Speed, a knot. Battery level: 85%. Rise to 25%. Leo, come on! Yes sir. Watch out! -I know. Be careful. Yes I know. Listen to me. Did you do it in training? The theory. I did the short course. So no. No water on it. You hear me? No water. No water. It will explode on contact with water. -A big fire. You understand? A big fire. And after? More oxygen. -That's not good. Always take it upstairs. Take the cartridge. Returns it. Lower the lever. Locked. We will approach the reactor side and let the current carry us to the evacuation lock. What's this? They are there! It's them! Silence! Silence! Listen! Wait. It's not clamping. -We are in position. It does not fit. -Why? 25% battery. 23. I will not let go. -We'll all die. We recharge and we come back. Open the ballasts. In 3, 2, 1... Forward all. Front left all. I do not hold the course. Warning! They hit the rudder! They go back! I confirm! They go back. The bastards! Come back! Come back! Come back! Silence! Silence! Listen to me carefully. They will come back. Believe me, they will come back! And if the stowage misses again? Let's go swimming again, by fast ascents. They are there. You know the relief ship. We have to get out of here! He does not have a hyperbaric chamber. Decompression will kill you, you know it. You go out, you die. We wait! We can not wait. We have already waited too long. Do not wait! Why did not you get stuck? I do not know. It is replaced every year. God knows when it was done. The rudder is damaged. Repair it! At your service. Change the battery. We start again, quickly. We only have one. It takes 12 hours to recharge. There is no spare? Our batteries were sold with the Mir, for the wreck of the Titanic. So... It's a little polar bear who goes to see his mother: "I am a polar bear, no?" She answers, "Yes, of course." And the cub says, "I see, thank you." The next day, the bear returns to see his mother and asks: "If I understood correctly, "Are you a polar bear?" And she: "Yes, of course." And the bear goes on: "And daddy too is a polar bear?" And she answers, "Yes, of course." And the bear cub: "I see. "I wanted to be sure." The next day, the bear returns to see his mother again and asks: "We have to clear this up. "Are you a polar bear?" And the mother: "Yes." "And daddy is a polar bear?" And she answers, "Yes." "So I'm a polar bear, right?" And she: "Yes." So, the bear asks: "Then why did I..." "So cold, damn?" Sorry, Oleg. "So why am I so cold, damn?" No kidding! Why is it so long? And the ring? It is heated in the hope that the oil will penetrate better, to soften it and allow stowage. This is hardly reassuring. Continue! The battery is almost charged! Leo! -Yes sir. Hammer! What do I say in Moscow? I'm taking care of it. Admiral Gruzinsky of the Northern Fleet. I must speak to Rear Admiral David Russell, of the Royal Navy. I will hand you over to him. Andrey! David! It's been too long! It is true. Tell me everything. You know the Priz and Mikhail Rudnitsky. They are designed to carry wood, not for the Barents Sea. How many survivors? I do not know. Maybe 20 or 25. The damage? At the rear of the reactors, the compartments are intact. All the rest is fucked. Your superiors will allow our coming? When I have tried enough to achieve the impossible with faulty hardware. I understand. Tell me if it's unlocked. You could do something. We propose to deploy the LR-5 immediately, our ultra-sophisticated rescue submersible, and any other material help. Russian teams failing to reach the survivors, international aid proposals flock. Great Britain, France, Norway and the United States offered their technical and logistical assistance. We propose to deploy the LR-5 immediately, our ultra-sophisticated rescue submersible, and any other material help. It could be a unique collaboration in history, which would sweep away the mistrust born of the cold war. But surprisingly, there is still no answer of the Kremlin and the admirals of the Northern Fleet. The hypothesis evoked by the sinking would be a collision with a foreign ship. With these silent submarines, it's a constant risk, aggravated, of course, by the aggressiveness of NATO. Support offers, will you accept them? Everything is still confusing at this stage. Viewing. Boris, check the batteries. Yes sir. Dead! The pump is in the road. -So? The water will go up. How much water? -What do we do? Calm down. -This is not good. Keep your strength and oxygen. Do not go to sleep. Maxim, what are you doing? We have to go. We should have gone a long time ago. Maxim, get out of there! Come back! Maxim, come back! Come back! Come back down! I want to live! Stopped! Stopped! Come back down! Stopped! You will not, stop! Hence the interest of accepting English and Norwegian help. The survivors are all in the back. Foreigners can be confined to this part of the building. Yes, they knew what they were exposing themselves to. But their wives? Follow the orders. No foreign interference. Very good sir. I understand. Marina? Where is she, Vera? She joins us. I arrive! Hurry up! Your attention please. Admiral Petrenko! I know you are going through a very difficult race. The President and I want to assure you that we are doing everything possible to bring back the men on board the Kursk. To that end, I will give you the list of vessels currently at sea. The flagship Peter the Great. The rescue ship Mikhail Rudnitsky. Admiral! What is the state of health of the crew? Have you established a radio link? Who is alive? Yes, who is alive? Are they hurt? And foreign assistance? You accepted it? If you let me speak, I will bring some clarification. The offers coming from abroad are under study. In the meantime, here is what we know. The Kursk is intact at the bottom of the sea. He is very... difficult to access. It lies 500 meters deep, where the visibility is almost zero. He is strongly inclined. What? The Barents Sea never reaches this depth. It is seen through glass. Our brave rescue teams... The Barents Sea is not so deep. Visibility is not what you say. Are you an expert in submarine rescue? Let the real experts work. I'm not an expert, but I'm not fooled either. Nobody here is. Nobody! You should not lie. You lie to us. How dare you! I'll return the question. We have children. We have husbands. Your husbands and sons are Russian sailors. All swore to defend the country at the risk of their lives. Rescuers on site do the maximum. They are well equipped. They have the latest equipment, as advanced, even better than that of foreign nations. Whatever! And everyone knows it. Sit and listen. Anger and insolence lead to nothing. Take a seat. My husband served in the Northern Fleet. We belong to the navy! We raised a sailor. Why? To die for nothing? Calm down or put yourself out. Tell us if they are still alive or at least how much time they have left! Calm down or put yourself out. She's right! Calm down. No! We waste time! You want our men to die for nothing! Damn you! You all! Damn you! You, your admirals, your officials... Go all hell! Where you put us, with our families and our children! We only demand justice! What did you do to him? Shame on you! It's a shame! David... I would like to accept your offer of help. What changed? -I do not know. Me? Divers on the Asgard oil platform in the North Sea will meet me in Trondheim with the LR-5. It will take 11 hours to join the site. Graham. -David. Here is Rear Admiral David Russell, he is leading the operation. Nice to meet you, gentlemen. Thank you for being here. Thank you. Before you go, we will ask you to sign a release for diving without a hyperbaric canoe. You give up pursuing the Stolt, in case of injury or death by irradiation or weapon of war. Admiral Petrenko is not here? He sent me. Do you take command? Yes. For the rescue operation. Waiting to take the lead of the Northern Fleet. Here is Rear Admiral Russell of the Navy aboard the Seaway Eagle. Solicited by Admiral Gruzinsky, we ask permission to approach the site. To you. Keep your current position until further notice. Shut off the engines. Mikhail. What are you doing? I need a pen. I have a pen. I'm not fine? Tell me. How old were you? when your father died? Three years. You know. What memories do you have of him? Tell me frankly. No. No. Misha... he will have only a very vague memory of me. And the baby... he will not have any at all. No that's not true. I feel my father. I know my mother loved him and loved me. In one way or another, he has always been part of me. That's what I have to tell him. Thank you. Graham Mann, who supervises the divers. And Admiral Einar Skorgen, NATO Commander North Norway, a key man of this operation. Here is the list of what needs to be done, including your technical and photographic records of the site. We need the characteristics of the airlock. Everything in its time. Everything in its time! Admiral, with all due respect, hurry up. Yes. We have to send our ROV to make radiation records... There was a mistake about this meeting. How? Russian rescue equipment works very well. Tomorrow we will decide your participation in the operation. What did we come here to fuck? I will be honest. With our divers and our equipment, we can get your men back in a few hours. We do not know anything about their condition. Accept our help. If there are survivors, we can save them quickly. I think I was very clear. When we meet again, if we need you, we'll tell you. We are waiting for your call. Why do they hang out? To protect their naval secrets and avoid national humiliation. Losing their jewel is humiliating. -Not if you wear the hat. A collision or an operation that failed? Maybe both. So what? We wait? We wait. And the men who are at the bottom? They are waiting too. I can not do it. -We're next. We are retrying! Turn around. We start again. Point. Battery level: 25%. We stay. Battery level: 12%. Battery level: 9%. Do not let go! Do not let go! 8%! Do not move! Do not move! Stay in place! You move! The battery is 7%, you have to give up. Abandoned! Open the ballasts. We go back. Ascension. You heard knocking? No nothing. Send the British at dawn. Admiral! It's for tomorrow morning! Put the divers in pressure, let them be ready. My friend... Do not leave me. Stay with me. What is this mess? Good God! You, I do not know. But I'm not ready to die. Hello Kursk! Hello! Breakfast will be served. Leo, help me. Come on, we wake up! Show me what you have. We will prepare a good little morning buffet. Come on, Sasha! What are you? Tuna. Great, fish! We have meat? Cakes? Crackers? Crackers? What are you guys? Never happy! What a coincidence! -Tuna. I have no desire to eat. Its good! For once the Navy ensures! Niko! Where is she? Get out. -Where is she? A real breakfast! I have some too. And me? It's warming up. It's so good! Maxim, look! We have everything we need. You want to go back, you? Not yet. We did not finish everything here. I repeat my joke about the polar bear? This time, you say nothing, Boris. So, it's a little polar bear who goes to see his mother and tells him... Drink a blow, rather. Without ordering you, little shit... Leo, be careful! Lift it! How long is it? A few minutes. It was an honor to serve at your side. Admiral! We are ready to go! Let's go! We move, check the oxygen. Divers under pressure. -Preparation at 106 m. Lets' go! We hurry! Check that the airlock is not flooded. Well received. Open the balancing valve and take a suction test. The airlock is flooded. No survivors My Mikhail said that those who had known the sea were changed forever. That they were different from the rest of the world, related to each other by the sea. That's why sailors save the sailors. Even at war. I do not know if we are at war. We will not know the opinion of the Kursk men. But before I die, my husband wrote us a letter to me, to our son and our unborn child. "Nobody has eternity. "But I wanted more. "I wanted to give you more. "And other children. "Love our son and the baby "for both of us. "Tell them again and again "that I love them, "how I loved you. "Find another man to love, "but love me too. "Even though I'm not "a moment for you, "You are my eternal." Misha Averin! Bravo. In the church. I have something for you. She belonged to your father. Thank you. Thank you. Mum.
