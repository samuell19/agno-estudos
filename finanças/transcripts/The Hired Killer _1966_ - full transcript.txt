Target 150 m, ready. Target 200 m, ready. Target 300 m, ready. Great, mr Harris. 9 and 8 average at that distance it's incredible! Nobody has achieved such a high score! I reserve the usual place for Saturday. No, this is the last time. And why? Hired killer Clint! Frank. Sorry, can I .. Yes, of course. Lucy, give me another coffee! Yes? I'm Clint Harris. The goods arrive at 5.30. Recall after shipment, at 5.45. Here. Go out again? Yes. Another job? Do you want a coffee? Yes thanks. One day or another, your brother will get us in trouble with this story. He's my brother. Lucy is right. Scuse her. As long as I'm here, this house is yours. This is my last job. I have enough, I'm tired. Clint .. Why don't you .. What? Why don't you enter into business with me? No, frank. I want to stay away from people. And get rid of this filthy work. Well, you finally decided! Do you think you really quit this time? See you later tonight. Here you are. Come on, buy a present for your little girl. No, I can not, Clint .. You've already done a lot for us. I'm sorry, Lucy. You mustn't have the impression that I have something against you as a person. But every time when a policeman enters on that door I feel like dying. I know. It will be a good match. See you tonight. I think the giants will win. Two coffees, please. At once. Ready, ready! Here high 322. Here high 322. Nothing to do. He is dead. Mr. Harris is here. You may go. Good morning. Good work, Clint. Very good. As usual. The police is still groping in the dark. We are very satisfied with you. Very satisfied. You did a wonderful job. You said it three times, it must be true. So, the money? What do you think, don't you trust us? Yes, I trust everyone... But now I'm tired and I want to quit. 15.000, at the finished work, as agreed... And another 20,000 in advance... For you. I can not understand. You never gave anything away... What's underneath? One of ours was busted by the FBI six months ago. But strange thing, he was released after three days. We know that he spoke, not much, sure, but what was enough for him to pay for his freedom. And now we are in trouble in Chicago and California to plug the holes that he opened. What's more, that bastard blackmail us. He was a big guy in Detroit and knows many things. But what is serious and that he spied on us. That guy is called frank secchy. Now he is in Europe. It's not my area. This was my last job and you knew it. Thank you very much, but I won't do anything about it. Frank? Clint. Senti, I changed the program. Get my stuff and bring it to me at pallisades park within an hour. No, it's better that I don't come, they are stalking me. Maybe I sowed them but I do not want you to run risks, do not worry. Ok. Yes, I'll wait for you. What happened? A guy followed me but I managed to unhook him. What will you do now? I don't know, I haven't thought about it yet. Did you notice if someone followed you? No. Who was it? Who was it? Clint! Secchy, it was frank secchy. He knows he's at the top of the list, so he keeps an eye on us. He controlls all our men, block all our moves. They saw you coming in here and they warned him in Paris. It's the war, Clint. Or secchy, or us. What can you tell me? 200,000 dollars. Hmm .. All right. There are 35,000 in that drawer for now. But try to remember one thing: This is not a personal affair. You work for the union, understood? Ah, another thing: I'll put you next to a new member. I work alone, gastel. You have your own style, Clint, which promises a lot. He must practice, he knows a lot of languages. We want him to work with you. But if it bothers me, I'll kill him. As you wish. But he will be useful to you. We could not help you much in Europe while secchy has a large organization you need a trusted man. What kind of man is he? I only saw him once, is one who frequented the high society. He gave sumptuous parties in his high-rise villa. He directed most of the operations by phone. After these photographs, he made himself a plastic. The union man in Paris is Mike durren. You will get in touch with him, who is already on the traces of secchy strange ring. Let lo bello enter. Ah, another thing: This is the text of the telegram that you will send me when the mission will be accomplished. Clint, here's the guy. Tony lo bello. He is smart, you'll see it. I know you by reputation, Mr. Harris. Ready? Paris online. No, I lost him, boss. Today he takes the plane for Paris, you want us to try again before he leaves? No, let him alive. Maybe it's better this way, sooner or later someone would have come anyway. Ok. Rent a car, go at elisir park hotel, I'll call you when it's time to look for durren. And you, what are you doing? Go to another hotel? Do not ask many questions. I like being alone. An 8 mm negative. Why had he killed himself, poor wretch? There is the name of the photographer. We're going to visit him. He could have wait a while before he comitted suicide. You are wrong, son. He didn't commit suicide. Whoever killed him, drank with him and then rinsed his glass. There is too little ice in the fridge for a single glass. He took the pen in his hand but they killed him before he could write something. And then, the one who decide to kill himself doesn't care if he is drunk or not. There was a towel around the gun which later was washed. And another thing: Try it sometimes; the gun doesn't remain in your hand. Don't move. Good. Another one. Yes, yes, this is good. Stay still... stop like this. Excellent. Let's see. Yes! That's fine. Stay still. Don't move. Excuse me, do you know this girl? Ask there. Let's do another one. Excuse me, do you know this girl, by chance? Yes, of course. This is Mary martell. Do you know where I can find her? Listen .. I know she usually dances at the American club. American club, thanks. Can you make me a copy of this? I'll pick them up tomorrow. Ok. 3.4 .. Let's go. 34 .. 69 .. So I'll call you. Bye. A coffee. Whiskey. Sorry, sir, only for members. We are friends of Mike duran. I read it in the newspaper. Poor Mike. But, kill yourself like that... No reason. He was a man who had everything from life. Yeah... we look for the address of a certain Mary martell. Mary .. Yes, she comes here often... But I can not tell you where she lives. Maybe there is someone who knows it. Come with me. Barry .. This gentleman would like Mary martell's address. He's a friend of poor Mike. Glad to meet a friend of Mike, but unfortunately, I can not help you. I have not seen Mary for a long time and I do not know where you could find her. You know, it's one of those... you know... who never stays two months in the same place. Yes, I know the type. Do you know someone who could tell me where she is? I do not know. Thanks anyway. It's still there. That's enough! So why were you following us? Go ahead, talk, bastard! We need his voice, not the gasps of a dying man. Mary is a friend of mine. Yes, I already knew. Is this package for her? Yes. Do you remember where she lives? We are friends of Mike duran. We need to talk to you. I hope you like the type of whisky .. Barry can not come. What happened to him? Did Mike ever talk to you about a certain frank secchy? What happened to Barry? He had to come to me. I was waiting for him, I had an appointment here. It was important. Had he ever talked about a certain frank secchy? I want to know why Barry doesn't come anymore. We talk but we don't understand each other. Listen. I do not know you and I do not want to talk about Mike. He is dead, may god rest him in peace. I do not care about anything now. And then, I'm not feeling to talk. Go away, please. Out! I'll be right back. The girl is loading. So, maybe now we will understand each other. What is it that you wanted to know? I wanted... Did Mike ever talk to you about a certain secchy? Yes, he did. I remember it well because it was really the last time we saw each other. He told me he had to talk to a doctor about this secchy. And we went together to the American clinic. But I waited for him outside in the car. Go on. But there is nothing else. Afterwards we went for a trip around Paris. And this represented a rather unusual fact for the kind of man who was Mike. The face of a man and modifiable up to a certain point. We, for example, can change the shape of the jaw or cheekbones but the curvature of the skull can not be changed. And neither the position of the ears or the base of the nose. As well as the distance between the eyes. I hope this information will be useful for your book. But what's going on inside? Can the psychology of an individual be changed? Yes, there are two different phases. In general, of course. The patient, after a crisis of loss and disorientation of, let's say psychotraumatic caracter .. Recovers. And move to a state of greater self-confidence. Once he gets used to his new appearance he acquires a superior boldness... So, if this person were an assassin would kill more frequently? I don't know, I've never had a killer as patient. I hope so. Thank you, doctor. Come in. Hello, old man. There are the photos, nothing special. There are hundreds in the neighborhood. Villas like these. What do we do now? Look for a cosmetic surgery specialist at the American clinic, this is the address. And what are you doing? Hello? He's coming. Hold him. All right, I'll do the possible. Go ahead, and open! Is it you dear? No, it's me, Clint Harris. Come on in, I'll be right away. You have a beautiful home. Yes, Mike was very generous to me. Every time I wait for someone, you arrive. I'll have to get used to your presence. This time I gained in the exchange. Excuse me, allow? I am a horror without makeup .. No, you're fine. Can you take a look at these photos? Wait a moment .. Look, I waited long enough. Have you ever seen this house? Pull me the zip. There are many houses like these .. But this one seems the one where we stayed with Mike after visiting the clinic. I like your boiling blood and your resourcefulness. I knew that the cops never drink when they are working... But you don't do anything! I'm old-fashioned. I prefer to take myself the initiative. Is it better? Yes. What happened? My glasses... give me my glasses. They are broken. I have another pair on the bedside table. Here? Yes. Thanks, old man. Without glasses, I feel like a deaf man. What happened? Two mugs arrived. They beaten me so hard... Then they asked me the text of the telegram the one that you had to send when the mission was accomplished. Unfortunately you never told it to me they did not want to believe me and they started beating me up again. I thought I was going to die, Clint. Unfortunately, the punches hurt. I am terrified of the beatings. I took so many in my life. First from my father, then from the guys on the street everyday I came home with a black eye or something broken. It took me a long time to learn to defend myself, until I have had a pistol. Then I found the right path and I joined the union. What did you think, to enter and be a member of the salvation army? We kill each other, killers against killers like a bunch of animals that devour each other .. I was at the clinic, as you wanted .. The specialist is a certain Dr. Goldstein but it seems to have left the hospital. But I have his phone number. Where is it? I must have it here if those two left it. Ut 1433 I'm sorry that they beat you. But it means that they are moving. Hello? Dr. Goldstein is absent. Do you want to leave a message? Yes, tell Dr. Goldstein to call room 437 at the elisee park. The man called me, set an appointment for two at a private clinic. Why do you wear it to the belt? The way I wear it is much faster. Never try it again, boy! Now I understand why you're bringing all those coins in your pocket. I'm doctor Goldstein. Do you want to follow me? I'm Charlie matlin. Please. This is Bob Peters. Pleasure. We are from the international revenue bureau. My conscience is clear, I pay all my taxes. Do you know this guy? Yes. This is John Morrison. We are investigating his complaint and we know that it was your patient. Is it true? Yes. Yes, indeed. But I can not understand .. In his complaint it appears that you to visited him three times presenting him a fee of 1500 dollars. Is it correct? No. No, this is not correct. I went to .. Let's see .. At villa ramea in fountainbleau... Only twice .. And my fee was pretty modest around $ 500. Thank you, doctor and apologize for the trouble. No problem. Can you leave me your address in case we still need you? Of course, I live in lausanne, at 32, metternick street. And for the 1500 dollars clients, always at your disposal. I would not count on it. Here is the villa. Let's stop in a place where we can observe it well. It seems deserted. Wait. Let me see. That is one of the two that beated me. There is also Barry. And that's maybe our man. We'll see that... tonight. See, has the scars on the neck and the ring .. Yeah. What's wrong with you? We have liquidated him. The deal is closed. I don't know .. That face, that ring, I've never seen them before .. Something is wrong. Did you want to find the ID card in his pocket with his old face? Why did you ask more money for the contract? To avenge your brother? What did you do before? Before becoming a professional killer? Nothing. You started working on your own, right? No, everything else. I was enlisted at 18, they gave me a rifle and sent me in the pacific to shoot. It was different .. No, then killing was legal. You see, if you learn to do well your job, really well, how it happened to me I don't know, something in here changes.. You start to believe that your only friend is the rifle you worry about it, you protect it, you sleep together... Sometimes I founded myself even talking with it. After a while, those figures you see in the viewfinder become neither more nor less than targets. And you think to hit as much as you can. Then the government no longer needs you and you go looking for someone to pay you to shoot. It's the only thing you can do. You are still in time. Your war was short and less harsh. And so far you have won. Quit everything and leave. You're joking, old man. Listen, they all respect me now. Nobody forced me to join the union, right? If I learned to kill, I owe it to myself. It's not a pleasant thing to do, but the victims are people you see only once before. Targets, as you said. And I take a lot of money. What do you want more? Why do not you send the telegram? Gastel will certainly be on the verge. Tomorrow, before leaving. Please wait. But where are you going? Are you with those people? Now, not anymore. Why don't you stay here in Paris? No, I can not. Sorry, it was a stupid question, I didn't have to ask you. Every time when I meet someone I'm good with, we have to separate. Now I have to go. Remember me. Of course. It's a story like many others, I know. A man and a woman meet, they like each other .. And the next day, each one on his way. Mary... I would like .. No. Forget it. You said you have to go, go then. Goodbye, Clint, and good luck. He's leaving. Yes, all right. I'm sorry. Flight 202 will leave 3 hours later. A ring found on the finger of the cadaver burned in the woods it's the only clue for the police Elisee park hotel. Mr. lo bello, please. Mr. lo bello is out. Do you want to leave him a message? Hello. I'm Clint. Ah, Clint... but you were not... Mary... Listen .. I need to see you. Now I'm going to the hairdresser and I will not be back before a couple of hours. All right. Clint, but what's wrong with you? This time they didn't succeed to get rid of me. Only you knew that I had not left. To whom did you tell? To whom did you tell? Speak! To Barry .. But I did not think he wanted to know for this reason! I did not know anything. He is the one who gives me the .. Clinton, I'm so lonely .. And I'm scared .. Dry your eyes, you look like a clown. How can I meet Barry? He's not at home. He said he was going to the American club, from there he was phoning me. If he calls you, make him come here with any excuse .. I'm going to look for him at the club and come back as soon as possible. Clint... help me! I'm scared! Sorry for a while ago. But you have to decide which way you want to stay. Do not bother. Excuse me, can I talk to you for a moment? Scuse me, I'll be back soon. Have you seen Barry? No, he has gone. And did he say where he was going? Do you want to drink something? No.A cognac. He passed from here a couple of hours ago with a suitcase and he took the week's salary then he went to the station at night, to the gare du nord, I think. Where can it be directed? I do not know for sure, but it seemed to me he spoke of a train that left around 11. Thanks. Hello. Hello, Mary? I'm Barry's friend. Have you any news about Clint Harris? Yes... I mean no. Where's Barry? I urgently need to talk to him. Tell him to come here right away. Yes, I'll tell him. Clint .. Clint, is it you? Who are you, what do you want? How did you enter? I was called secchy frank secchy. Tony, behave yourself! Give it back to me! Send her away! But were not you supposed to be on the plane? Send her away, I said! But why, don't you like her? But who is he? What does he want? It's enough that I like her, right? What manners... you know .. For my eyes is easy .. No, a moment! I can not go out like that! Come on, old man, you make me feel ashamed! But I can not go away like this! But what happens, may I know? Let's go to Mary. Come on, get dressed, hurry up! Yes, sir! Too late. She died recently. She surely was stuffed with drugs. She fainted inside the tub, she went under and paf! Well thought out. There's nothing to say. Our man has created himself an iron alibi. We do not play riddles, Clint. The hot water which enters is equal with the one that comes out. The heat prevents the body from assuming cadaveric rigidity and therefore also to establish the exact time of death. Here we have nothing more to do. This must not have happened. We're still in trouble. It is not said. Secchy is worried. I was wrong. I overestimated him. I thought it more inteligent. It was the man killed at the villa who put me off the road. I do not understand. A man like secchy who is bothering to change his face to save his skin does not continue to wear a ring that could identify him. Furthermore I do not think that with all his presumption he could resist at the temptation to be seen by his presumed assasin to laugh of him. Secchy could be one of the many we met. A barrista, a passer-by, anyone. The secretary, please. I have a half idea who it is. Really? But for now and just a suspect. Hello? I would like to send a telegram please. Urgent. "To Dr. Goldstein. 32 .. I do not understand. Metternick. M-e-t lausanne, Switzerland. Urge your presence due to a serious car accident. I await phone call by appointment. Signed, Charles Martin." Add the hotel name and room number. And as soon as the answer arrives, I'll review it. Thanks. Would you mind enlightening me, old man? I want to talk with him again. Perhaps without knowing it he can give me the answer. You wait here, just call me call me at the hotel. Look, why don't you return home? I can very well do it myself. There's a plane to new York tonight, get it. If one day we will meet again down there, you will offer me a beer. You think I'm a sucker .. No. Thanks. Hallo? A moment. Mr Harris? For you. Thank you. Hello? I received the answer now. Goldstein will be here tomorrow morning at 9.30. Go get him at the airport and then accompany him to the American club. Get up. What do you want? Come down. Let me dress. Put the coat on and do not make jokes. What do you want from me? I invited people here and I wanted to be sure you were here, too. Good morning. I hope that the telegram with the urgent call was not a joke. What do you want from me? I wanted you, secchy. Thanks for coming to the appointment. Where are your "nurses"? You were very smart at getting the solution. Too bad it's too late. You think it's too late? I have to say the same about you. You were very clever when you met me at the clinic, face to face. You were very ingeniuos to make me find that guy with those scar on the neck. Unfortunately, despite your ability you were wrong, too! That's right! If you were smarter than you are you would have been in New York at this time .. What did I do wrong? All. The ring, for example. It was as if you were saying: "Look, I have a new face but I'm keeping my old ring" then, if you were the one from the villa they would not worry about to burn you out so you don't get identified. For what purpose? Furthermore, a megalomaniac like you couldn't resist at the temptation to be seen. You could play the part of any appearance you would have liked, instead you have chosen that of the great surgeon. In front of my guns you're still saying that I am wrong. But it's you who are going to die. You dare to judge me, you, a poor wretch. I have not failed yet. I would like to know what a guy like you feels like in such a moment. Good. You killed my brother and that girl. You mean you did all this for revenge. I thought you were a professional. Ok, now you command. Tell me a sum. How much do you want? I would like to know what a guy like you feels like... in such a moment. Hey, old man... what happened? Did they get you? Stop acting now. For whom do you work? I only pretended to send that telegram to Goldstein and when you gave me his answer you betrayed yourself. Do you intend to kill me, old man? No, I only kill for a fee. For whom do you work? For the union. For gastel. They knew you could only do this job. But they did not intend to pay so much. But you also agreed with secchy, right? From the day they stomped me. I told him about everything. You also said that fists hurt. Go on. I told him I would have killed you when the work was finished and that if I had not succeeded, here he would have waited your return to America to kill you then one of them asked me if I wanted to be on their side they gave me a bunch of money and they told me what I had to do, to make the appointment at the private clinic do you remember? And everything went perfect. But then, the telegram from the airport .. And I could not do anything about it. Everything would have been right if you had taken that damn airplane. You took the money from secchy, you killed him and then you went to gastel, tell him how good you were, and you put in your pocket my money. You forgot two things: They would never give you what they decided to deny to me. And first you'd have to kill me. I told you to leave, son. May I take my handkerchief? You wouldn't solve anything by killing me, old man. There is another bullet with your name waiting for you in America. Subtitles by cineploit 2020
