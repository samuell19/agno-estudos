Open it! - This way! - A thief! A thief! - Have the police come yet? - Thank you for coming. You are in our way Genta, look inside of the warehouse. Let's go to the warehouse. Where is the master? Oh, Mr. Sobei. What’s the matter? - Dream was stolen. - "Dream"? A masterpiece by Enshu Kobori. You can't get it, even by paying more than 5,000 ryo. This is big trouble. Actually it's a tea bowl presented by Sir Sadanobu. What? Sir... Up there... Dream Yumeno-Ukihashi = "a floating bridge in a dream" He's over there! Yumeno- Ukihashi is over there! Block his path! Go that way! This way! - He's over there. - On the roof! - Cooperate with us! - Yumeno-Ukihashi, you're under arrest! - Co-operate with us! - You're under arrest! This way! You're under arrest! Sir! Don't let him run away! Cooperate with us! Ukihashi, you're under arrest! Don't let him get away! Block his path! You're under arrest! Where did he go? Close off this area! - Don 't lose him! - Search for him! - Where is he? - This way! - Search for him! Search everywhere! This is a police search! About an hour ago, a thief broke into... a Hinokuma-ya lumber wholesaler in Fukagawa Kiba. If you guys harbor him, you are equally guilty The tiger's disguise... is defeated by the fo> and borrows the cat's claws. Are you ridiculing us? No, not at all... We are a group of losers, who love comic tankas. We are holding a memorial service for our fellow comic tanka poet, Kiyonari Ozen. Who are you'? Juzaburo Tsutaya from 50 Ken Street, in Yoshiwara. I know that... You are the publisher of lewd books. I'm Utamaro Kitagawa, the man who wants to paint lewd paintings, but is not allowed. And you'? A comic tanka poet, Enju Shimizu. Oh, you are the one who used to be a low-level vassal of the Tokugawa shogunate. And you'? Sanji Furai or Genanai Hiraga or Kigai Fukuuchi or... Oh, okay! Stop kidding around! Hey! The elderly man over there's other name is... You... Oh, l am very very sorry even though I didn't know! I'm going incognito, and can't reveal my name. So please forget that you ever saw me. Yes, sir... Genta! Come here! Go! You idiot! Thank you for helping me while I was in danger. - I will not forget your kindness. - That's fine. Just leave quickly Please, this way... So, forgive me for leaving... Hey you! I'm the best portrait painter in Edo. You can get a souvenir of Edo for only three mon. Only three mon! - Hey you, cool dude! - Me?! Your face can become a great painting! Oh, no! You guys are my nemeses. That's interesting. Why not us? You know why! You are malicious. - That gentleman is a painter. - How could you tell? I can tell from his eyes. If you hang around here, I can't do my business. Go away! Hey let's go. A pickpocket! Excuse me! It's dangerous... Excuse me. You! Come with us! - Stop it! - Shut up! You are the pickpocket! I'm a samurai from the Satsuma clan. This woman definitely bumped into me intentionally and... What the hell are you talking about? You're the one who bumped into me. - Stop flirting with me. - Damn you! Or do you have evidence? Shall I strip under the bright sun'? - Great! - Do it! You! Don't even think I'm blind. This is... No, this is... Don't play dumb! You, too, are in this. You will be punished! Wait a moment... - Dankaku! - Wait a moment. - Dankaku! I'm Dankaku lchikawa, the head of the nearby Kannon-za theater. So what? Officer, at least this gentleman is not part of the pickpockets. What? The other night, you were at Yanagibashi... Anyway I will clear the gentleman's name. Let me borrow this. Sir, please come this way That is the way it was. But the woman is definitely a professional pickpocket. Damn, she ran away Busy streets in Edo are dangerous. Please be careful. Oh, thank you. I saw that! Since when has the pickpocket woman been your lover? Don't be stupid. But I think that I have seen her somewhere... Why aren't these any good'? Uta-san, women are difficult... You can't paint them unless you know them, of course, but if you know them too well, that's not good, either. If you can't paint them, no matter how much you... look at them, maybe you should shut your eyes. Stop your nonsense. Hey you! This man is very very serious. If you treat him too roughly he won't be able to paint, because his mind is fragile. If he is that fragile, I don't want to do business with him. How cruel... Listening to you makes me angry Here is a galley proof for the picture book Selected Insects of Japan. Darkening the shade of the bellflower was the key to success. Why Uta-sen? You can paint this type of subject very well, so why not women? Are you a homosexual? Or did your wife... suck out all of your energy? I will paint... I do want to paint women. Hey Uta-san! Wait a moment! Hey! Hey! Because you said that. Damn it! Hey! Wait! Hey! Uta-san! I understand your feelings, but don't be so upset. Hey hey wait! You know, my friend, Genpaku Sugita, published a book called New Text on Anatomy. After all, a woman is this. I heard that lumber was overabundant in Edo. Do we really make a profit from buying up lumber with so much money during such a time? It is a business practice to do the opposite of what other people are doing. Then, what can I gain? You should know very well. Are you telling me that I can get a post... in the Shogunate government? Humbly speaking, there is nothing that you can't buy with money in this world. By the way it was a big mistake that the tea bowl by Enshu was stolen. We have to think of something else... to present to Sir Sadanobu. Your company is here. You haven't changed, Sangetsu. Lord, your partner is finally here. Kizaki is the best Oiran in Yoshiwara. I want to die on top of hen Just looking at her takes me to heaven. Not yet? Not yet? Okay! That hurts. NO! Oh' no! You two are so rough! Are you done'? Hurry UP! Oh, well. I'm tired. Let me have the pipe. Okay Here you go. Hey sharing a pipe is not good, especially after Enju. You can transfer diseases to each other. You might already have a disease, though. - Excuse me, but I don't have any diseases. - Who knows? Human beings cannot see the poison of disease. It's true. Who is our neighbor? He is neither a doctor, nor a fortune teller. He is a walking encyclopedia, who is informed on everything from Chinese knowledge, to Western knowledge, and on to Japanese knowledge. Sujaku... Why don't you open up your mind? My mind is not for sale. That makes me want it even more. I have been coming to only you, for a whole year. Is there any man who you are in love with? Sujaku is a prostitute. If a prostitute falls in love, only death awaits. Sujaku still has a lot of lingering attachment to this world. I only dream of love. How dare you say that to me? I want to make you cry If you cry for my love, I won't mind abandoning the 50,000 goku position of Daimyo. You laughed. I'm about to go crazy Become crazy Sujaku. Please become crazy with me. No... Don't... Dear! It's done... See, these are hanging boats. - Hello. Coming in. - Yes. Welcome. Onatsu, this is great. This is a masterly skill. I will make a prettier one ne> - What's this? - What's the matter? - You are stepping on them. - Sorry... You watched them for a long time. How scary... - Human beings' bedroom scenes are sad. - What? How can I express this sadness in my strokes? What? This is Tangonokami... This is Hinokuma-ya... - This reeks of conspiracy - Do you know them? These paintings should be hidden at the bottom of a bo> or painted over in solid black. Why do you suddenly say so? This and this and this and this... - I'm going to borrow them. - Hey what are you doing? Those are my precious rough sketches. - Tea... - I'll stop by again. You're kidding! Hey! Unfortunately the Shogun didn't agree with it. Therefore, I will return this to you. Since this is a special kind of thing, please examine it. It will be trouble if you complain, later, that any is missing. That's absurd. Please keep it for yourself. Your request could not be fulfilled. l cannot accept this. Sir Yamashironokami, please make a request one more time. Sir Tangonokami, the Shogun said that, once a tree was out, it could not return to its previous state. Please excuse me. Yes. This is a very convenient piece of equipment for cutting off heads. - How heavy is it? - It's about 10 kan (37.5 kg). Pull this string up, and drop it down. That's all. With this equipment, there is no need for the masterly skills of officers, for cutting off heads. Let me show you. Father... - Did Tangonokami leave? - Yes... But I don't think he will give up that easily Tangonokami pretends to be a fool, for example, visiting Yoshiwara often, but he is actually very sharp. Then, is there any hidden deeper reason for him to buy up lumber... - in cooperation with Sobei of Hinokuma-ya? - I would say so. To get to the point, he is aiming for the two of your... I see. My father and I have plenty of hateful enemies... who say that we are bribe takers, or upstarts. Tangonokami is like the hidden blade of the only man of whom I'm afraid. I wonder who the only man the lord is afraid of is? Matsudaira Ecchunokami Sadanobu. I see. He is a grandson of the eighth Shogun, Yoshimune and one of three Tokugawa families. A son of Munetake Tayasu. He is the man best suited... to become the head of the senior councilors of the Shogunate. Hey! They say this is a woman. This rotten shellfish! Look closely... ls this a woman? Uta-san, what happened? - You usually can't drink, but you are so theatrical now. - Manpei! - Look at this. This is a woman. - Don't bother. - This is a woman. What are you'? What did you do? Uta-san, Uta-san. Stop, Uta-san. Welcome! Don't bother the drunken monkey Monkey? I see... Are you... the famous Horishin? Please, please carve my woodcut print. Please. You idiot! - An insolent man! - An insolent man? This is terrible! It hurts! This is no laughing matter! I don't know who the hell you are, but you dominate the approach... to the Shozen shrine in a lordly manner. - See! I got hurt! - Please forgive us. I'm not such an easy mark! Hey! Let me go! Damn you! Hey you! You in the palanquin! Isn't it proper procedure that you come out of the palanquin and apologize to me? Since this is a confidential visit, please forgive us. No! If you don't show your face, I'm gonna make you show it to me. Open it! - Go away! - Let me go! - Damn you! - Hey! - What's the matter?! - Hattsan! - Are you okay? This is terrible... You! Damn you! - Why the hell did you kill him? - Hey! Look, Uta-san: they're playing an obviously amateur trick. They're swindling others again! Hey Uta-san! Stop it, Uta-san! Leave them alone. What are you?! For human blood, you'd better mi>< in more orange. Who the hell are you?! I'm sorry to barge in, but I am a painter. Human blood is not as vivid as this. Damn you! Stop doing such an obviously amateur trick. - Don't disturb us! - Remember us! - We will pay you back! - Stupid! - Damn you! - Stupid! Thank you very much. What is your name? I'm Utamaro. Utamaro... Because this is a confidential visit, I cannot tell... you my name, but I really appreciate it. Have a good day! While I am in the shop all day I see a variety of people. People say that the people in a palanquin, and the people who carry it, and the people who make the sandals for them... This is an actual observation window to this transitory world. - I can't paint... - What? Sir! Don't move. - Is there anything that's different from usual? - No, not at all. As soon as you see Yumeno-Ukihashi, inform us. Thank you for your hard work! It's no joke! How dare a hairdresser dream? What if you see him? What will you do? I will shave his beard and show him the way to escape. Okay it's done! - Thank you very much! - Sir, I beg you... Go away! Dirty fella! Recently the number of beggars has been increasing... It's because of the famine. Thank you very much! Onatsu, could you show this man mercy? But you told me that you would go out for dinner. No, not that... I want you to give this man your body for one night. Dear... That's a bad joke. You sleep with this man! Dear! Dear! Dear! Dear! Hurry! Please! Dear! Hey you! I'll give you a discount! Come with me... 1, 2, 3, 4... 20 and 4 mon. This is only half of the price of soy pulp. This is the trend of the times. Hurry UP- I still need to earn more money - Show me... - What? - Show me your... Wasn't that enough'? I'm getting weary What are you doing'?! You bastard! Let me go! Hey mister! I'm returning this to you. And I have to give you my gratitude. You... In Okuyama sometime... That's beautiful... You are an affected fellow. I'm not affected. The world is too big for me to see without doing this. Edo is only a tiny bit, compared to my naughty bits. Don't move... Are you going to paint me? Yes. All of your beauty - That's impossible. - Impossible? I'm a woman who was born from the bubbles of Edo... So, no one can paint me. Don't be hasty Oh, good... Onatsu, give me some tea. Onatsu! Sir Sano, why don't you become a god? L, become a god? A gracious social reform god. That's outrageous! I'm only a 500 koku retainer of the Shogun. The position is only Shingobashuu. In brief, I'm only in charge when the Shogun goes out. But the social standing of your family is much higher... than that of Sir Tanuma, the senior councilor. That was a long time ago. As a matter of fact, the Tanuma family used to be vassals of the Sano family So, I lent the Sano family's genealogy to Junior Elder Sir Okutomo, but he hasn't returned it. I also have had a bitter experience because of Sir Tanuma. The Tanumas, father and son... are really the ringleaders... as people say... Please don't speak carelessly Just relax and have fun today - Yes! - Good evening. - Thank you for your support, always. What is this? Why do you offer me such cordial hospitality? - It's only my greeting for meeting you. - But... Don't be uptight. Please have a seat. I'm tired... ls it Uta-saws turn? - I'm going, then. - Yeah. Hello, Lord. Are you sleeping? Hello. - What's the matter? - 'Dream'... Fascinating... Even I didn't notice. I'm just a painter! A painter? - Who asked you'? - No. I'm not like that... I'm not! Why? You are pretty good, Ukihashi. You are too good to be a thief. You are also too good to be a bodyguard for a lumber wholesaler. Hey what are you going to do with the swords? I don't know. Maybe l will use them to grate radishes. Okay I will leave them with you for a while. This transitory world is large, yet also small. We may meet again... See you. - We were waiting for you! - Dankaku! - The best in Japan! - Dankaku! After all, this world is a dream within a dream. Dankaku! "After all, this world is a dream within a dream." Here, Uta-san. Hey look at the woman. She is from the inner palace, and came here secretly Really Dankaku isthe best in Japan. I sent a flower to Dankaku in your name. Thank you, always... I appreciate your kindness. Not at all. Because of your recommendation, most of the ladies in the inner palace support me. I will not forget your kindness. I have also gotten to know this dream-like world with your help. It is so much fun. I'm happy to fulfill your wishes. Please excuse me for leaving. Dream Master, here is a flower from the audience in the West box. - I see. Open it. - Yes. Then, who is the audience? It's confidential, but if you must ask, the answer is that she is the Elderly Sawanoi, from the inner palace. Madame Sawanoi? Attention! - Dankaku! - The best in Japan! - Bravo! Thank you very much for your attendance today l, Dankaku lchikawa, really appreciate it from the bottom of my heart. I beg o fall of you, in this theater, your continuous patronage. I sincerely appreciate and welcome you. - Dankaku! - The best in Japan! - He looks similar... - What? - Dankaku... The way he moves is exactly like Yumeno-Ukihashi. That's good. The title of the play is also Lovers' Suicide, Yumeno-Ukihashi. My wallet is missing... My wallet... Oryo! Uta-san! The popular Dankaku play! Dankaku lchikawa! Welcome! Watermelon! I feel a gloomy foreboding... The horoscope also says so. Society will change soon. Sir Tanuma is in trouble... He may fall from power. Why are you laughing? The public is talking about Sir Tanuma taking bribes or something bad, but the fact is, he was born 300 years ahead of his time. What are you doing? This is something precious! If politics change, society will become bad. I will hate that kind of rigidity... So l will go on a journey My return will be up to the wind. Okay so I will give you one thing as my parting gift. Don't bother with that. Just follow me... This is a penance service, which is a secret process originating from... esoteric Buddhism, that was originally held for the union o fa married couple. Now it is only a spell to attract the man you love. It's nothing now... Welcome! How about some cold barley tea? - Lady l will leave the money here. - Yes. Thank you very much. - Here you go. - It was yummy - Thank you. It's hot... - Welcome! - May I have some cold barley tea and some rice flour dumplings? Yes. Please wait a second! - I'll leave the money here. - Yes. Oh, you are really good. Lady come here for a moment. Look at this. This really resembles you. This is for you. I'm so happy. Walk! Hey! Give me some rice flour dumplings! Yes! Welcome! A female informant for the thief, Yumeno-Ukihashi, was arrested. What? Osono, the authorities are merciful. If you honestly disclose the location of Yumeno-Ukihashi's hideout, you will be forgiven, with only a three year exile on an island. I can't betray him! What did you say? Damn you! Even if she has to go to hell, a woman will never tell... - the name of the man she loves. - Stop your nonsense! You are definitely a cunning fox, who has lived and worked in Hinokuma-ya for three years, in order to snitch for him. Genta, make her drop down on all-fours. We will make you confess, without any haste. No! Don't do that! The way she crumbles, that is truly a woman. The epitome of a woman. Mr. Utamaro. You are... A human being is a deeply sorrowful creature, isn't he? You... Why do you paint this sorrowful creature? L--- Because you are sorrowful? Or lecherous? No, I paint... Stop. You don't have to... Everyone is chasing blindly after something. This is your dream, isn't it? But it's good... A painter is good. But I'm a shadow... Merely a shadow of a human being. He's over there! Yumeno-Ukihashi is over there! Dream Hey buy this! Buy this! ls it a dream or an illusion in the Plain of High Heaven? Yumeno-Ukihashi appeared again. The world originated from the Plain of High Heaven, and poetry started from the Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry... Dream "Thank you very much for your sincere kindness to Osono. "I hope this will be some help for your painting amusement: Dream." "After having dreamed of my love during slumber, "l always make a wish on something transitory like a dream." "Something transitory like a dream..." Like a dream... Please forgive my rudeness. However, I truly wanted to see you once more. You are my dream. Therefore, I want to paint you with even more passion. I see... However, I have a favor to ask you... Whatever you ask. I'd like to see the world of people. I'd like to walk down the streets of the city that I always only get a glimpse of... from the inside of a palanquin, on foot. Like you said, all of the streets of the city are alive. Yes... Everyone lives with their own dreams. Look at that. That is a fire tower. - What are those? - Water pails. But I feel sorry for your attendants. Let's run away - Seriously? - Yes. We completely gave them the slip. Welcome! Thank you for waiting. Please... Soba and sake go together pretty well. Then, just a little bit... Thank you for waiting! It is fully absorbed by my stomach. A little more... Are you sure? I feel I'm alive. I will not lose my composure. Excuse me! Excuse me! Stop it! Come out! Stop it! Bloodshed inside of Edo castle Okitomo died August: Okitsugu ilanuma was dismissed from the position of senior counselor September: leharu Tokugawa died The senior counselor, Sadanobu Matsudaira Etchunokami, attends! Who are you'? Is asking pointless? I will keep you alive... Convey the message to Tangonokami that, if your farewell is messy you will ultimately ruin yourself. You have finally become... a real entity in this world. I myself recognize that I am able to move my brushes freely But... there is another thing... like this... Who is this 'Sharaku' fella? He doesn't tell where he is from, or how he grew up, or where he lives, or his own name. And he just left for who knows where. It can't be... A human being is a strange creature... A guy like this exists too. It is at the foot of a mountain path... from my last journey... A story of the Children's Limbo... Onatsu... Listening to it is... You... Even so, you have completely changed. I hear about you often, as a word in the air. I'm glad that you became a fine painter. - Come back to Edo with me. - No. Why not? Are you still angry at me? No... My life was only four and a half tatami mats. But now... I don't care about the four and a half tatami mats. - The one who taught me that was you. - Me? That night, you also taught me... that my body is only a dream. I think... that dreams can come true in this world. You are a lucky man. Me? You are always chasing after a dream. Isn't it... life? For me, it is nothing now. "I might stray from darkness to a dark path. "Moon near the mountains, please cast a light along the path to a distance faraway" It's a poem by Shikibu lzumi. I believe that even a woman can attain spiritual enlightenment. Therefore, I walk. Please stop. I will have regrets. My lady... I don't want to leave this world with any regrets. Please call me. Quickly... Omiyo. Omiyo. Hello... Weren't you painting portraits in Okuyama a few years ago? Why did you quit? Because it didn't feed me. I was popular for a short while and I also painted actors, but I heard that the reputation of my paintings was not good. That's too bad, considering your great skills. I'm thinking about painting the landscapes that I saw on this journey when I get back to Edo. Don't do that. Are you alright? Because you can paint such beautiful women, I gave up on painting beautiful women. Hey lady Come here. - Pull yourself together. - Are you alright? What happened? Don't touch me! Pull yourself together. Here you go. If you sleep there, you will catch a cold. I will prepare your futon quickly I see... This man is Sharaku. Now, he is Hokusai, but he used to be Sharaku. I have changed, haven't l'? Yes. You became even more seductive than before. Now, I'm the mistress of a successful merchant. If Edo changes, the people will change too. Please come to visit my home. I'm glad... I wanted to spend some quiet, intimate time with you. This is nota dream... That's why there are still embers inside of me. The time we spend now is only a brief moment, compared to the long passage of time. This is a transitory world... Lives just float here. You can't live, unless you cling to something. You are lucky because you can live in a dream. Please call me Oryo! Oryo! Damn whore! Don't hurt this man! I'm the one who tempted him, so if you want to hit or kick someone, please do it to me. But you can't take my heart away It is all that poor people have. You deserve to be poor for forgetting my kindness in picking you up. I don't want you, you crude and perverse thing. I will show you the ways of rich men. You were caught by Sir Sakon when you pick-pocketed my wallet. You shouldn't have forgotten the power of the money that released you at the time. Throw the paramour out. How about watching that so-called heart on your way? How about this? Isn't it hard? Isn't it vexing? Hateful? Are you ashamed? What a whore you are. You enjoy it. The important point of the reform is to restore the now-corrupted public morals. Extravagant clothing, sumptuous meals and... excessive amusement must all be strictly controlled. Ukiyo-e pictures and theaters, especially should be severely restricted. Because ukiyo-e pictures and theaters disturb people's minds. The scariest thing is disturbed peoples' minds. They can become a strong enough power to collapse the Shogunate government. What's the matter? You, a menace to society are here. I have no idea what you are talking about. The command of the Shogun! "Juzaburo Tsutaya, also known as Koushodo... "You are reprehensible, because you publish... "books and ukiyo-e pictures that disturb society "Therefore, half of your property will be confiscated, "and we will order you to be placed in shackles for 50 days. "Utamaro Kitagawa. Because you have painted many pornographic pictures, "we order shackles for 50 days and imprisonment for three days." - Officer, why? - Shut up! "Enju Shimizu. All of your books will henceforth... "be prohibited from being published, and we order hand shackles for 30 days." South Edo Magistrate Office, City Regulator, Police Sergent, Sakon Tachibana. - Officer! - Please wait! Please forgive us! Why officer? Why? Do you dislike pleasure between a man and a woman? Shut up! These things don't disturb society The ones who are disturbing society are you! Stop grumbling! - You are the ones! - Take them away! Yes, sir! My women! The skin of my women is being burned. What are you doing to my women?! Uta-san! Uta-san! Don't be involved with a crazy man. Where is your elderly fellow? Stop it! Dankaku! Cooperate with us! Here is another pack of dogs. The best in Japan! The command of the Shogun! Step away! "Dankaku lchikawa. It is truly reprehensible that you staged performances, "which make light of the Shogunate. "Therefore, we order you to dismiss the drama company and to pull down the Kannon-za theater. South Edo Magistrate, Higonokami lkeda. Please wait! Please don't force us to pull down this theater. Please! Be quiet! Please don't hit men so easily - Start pulling it down! - Yes, sir! Please calm down! Sawanoi, I was waiting for you. Theater-going is now prohibited. You must be prepared. Note: This is the first part of an old poem written by a woman, Ono no Komachi, which can be found in the "Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry", edited in the early 10th century. Because I fell asleep while I was thinking of him, I had a dream about him. If I had known it was a dream, I wouldn't have woken. It's a fire! Fire! Flower petals of faded color are left on branches. When I woke up from a dream at midnight, I mistook the petals... for snowflakes in the darkness. Who would pluck faded petals? After a dream forsook me, I had nowhere to go. Thank you very much for your attendance today I appreciate your patronage of Yumeno-Ukihashi, as well as that of Dankaku. Note: While cherry blossoms are blooming, Japanese people enjoy the sight and have parties under the trees. This period is very limited, about 10 days a year. lt ends when the blossoms have completely scattered, but the time when the blossoms are falling offers the most beautiful sight.... Scattering cherry blossom also reminds Japanese people of "the end of a great time" or "death". Ukihashi feels the end of his time in this scene, and he is sad because nobody is there to witness his grand departure. Where has everyone gone? Please buy this! Big news that deserves a moment of a beautiful spring evening. The best thief in Edo, Yumeno-Ukihashi, has been caught! No... Ukihashi is... Snow light which has almost... faded away because of the departing spring, in a village in Miyoshino. Let me read this to you: "A mysterious thief, Yumeno-Ukihashi, "who is known all over Edo city is actually Dankaku lchikawa, "an extraordinarily perverse man. He was fanned by a southeast wind... "coming from the huge fire in Edo last night, and he has disappeared." - Dankaku! - Tsuruya! - Dankaku! - The best in Japan! Now, everyone... So long! The 'red horse' runs very well. The price of lumber will jump because of this. On the deposed Shogunates estate, an abundance of lumber is growing. How terrifying, the power of money It's true. Even the beauty of nature is as we please. Tanuma knew its terror very well, and got drowned in it. Now, guide me there. It was just the wind. It's you! I heard that on the deposed Shogunates estate, plenty of good lumber is growing. Damn you! Someone like you will be handled with this sword that I stole... Come out, and fight! Come out! Wait! Someone like you, who accepts defeat churlishly will be hated, even by Buddha. The things that I hate are jealousy from the one who is not loved, those who abuse women, and those who never try to dream. Do you still insist upon doing this? Why? It's a good time to die, isn't it? "A good time to die"? After all, it was a brief and transitory world. It was more than enough for me. It's too bad that I cannot show this brilliant scene to the audience. The same here. If l must ask, Yumeno-Ukihashi on a spring evening... A bank of clouds separated... along the ridges in the sky...
