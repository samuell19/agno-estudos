[MUSIC PLAYING] WAITRESS: Good afternoon, sir. Having lunch? Hi. Could you take me to the manager's office? [GUNSHOTS] FLEEING CUSTOMERS: Police! Help! Police! Good morning. CRIME VICTIM: Stop! Thief! [CHATTER] Welcome to the club. VOICE FROM TAPE RECORDER: You been instructed To remain silent and not ask questions. The duration of the trip is to two and a half hours. On the seat next to you are gloves, A blindfold and sunglasses. [CAR STARTS] VOICE FROM TAPE RECORDER: Do not ask questions. One the seat next to you are gloves, A blindfold, and sunglasses. Put them on. [CAR STARTS] MAN IN SUNGLASSES: Driver, how much longer? DRIVER: We've been on the road about two hours already. VOICE ON TAPE RECORDER: You have been instructed To remain silent and not ask questions. The duration of the trip is two and a half hours. Under no circumstances are you to remove The blindfold until instructed to do so. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] DRIVER: You can remove the blindfold now. MAN IN SUNGLASSES: Thanks. I was beginning to get a little woozy. DRIVER: Just the blindfold. The gloves stay on. Greetings. Come meet the others. You call me number one, and you'll be known as four. Remember that. Gentlemen. This is number four. And the last one to arrive. Number three, number five, number six, Number seven, number two. Please, be seated. Well, I'm sure you're all anxious to know What we're up to. Now that we're all here, I'll begin. First, I want to assure all of you That my deal with each and every one of you is identical. Each one of you was selected from a distant area. And each one was guaranteed a minimum of $50,000. Now the total time involved is three days. Question, number five? Yeah. Why all this? Just what are we going to do? Well, I think it's obvious. We're going to pull off a job... a big one. And this is going to be perfect. You know, gentlemen, a perfect crime Is not so much in its execution, but Being able to get away with it. Whenever a big job is pulled, like the Brinks Haul or the English Mail Train Robbery, almost immediately The full force and power of the law goes into effect. No expense is too great to apprehend the criminals. Now gentlemen, if I may be blunt, with your past records, We can assume that at least one of you Will be under suspicion once the job is finished. Now let us further assume you're forced to talk. What is it you possibly could tell them? You were contacted by a man you didn't know, Sent an airplane ticket, told to fly to Los Angeles, Picked up in an automobile, blindfolded, Driven approximately two and a half to three hours to a place You've never been to before. Haven't the slightest idea where it is. Then you're introduced to six men, all wearing beards, With no names, answering only to numbers from one to seven. And what we don't know can't hurt us. NUMBER ONE: Exactly. NUMBER SIX: And the gloves? For fingerprints, of course, in the unlikely event Someone should re-discover this place. So remember, keep them on at all times. You even sleep with them on. So we remain a mystery to each other? NUMBER ONE: Exactly. Even to my driver. I'm the only one who knows each man's identity. You must never reveal your names, your past, your family, The city or state that you're from. In short, you're to reveal nothing about yourselves. Your very lives will depend on each man's attitude and action Doing the mission and on each man's ignorance afterward. Is that understood? Good. Now to simplify things, change into your jumpsuits On your cots. Now we'll be cooking for ourselves. We have a stove and refrigerator stocked With frozen food, beer, and soft drinks. Any questions? Yeah. Exactly what kind of job are we going to be pulling off? You'll learn more about that in the morning. In the meantime, gentlemen, remember That for the next three days, silence is very, very golden. That's the damnedest thing I've ever heard of. Makes sense to me. I'm afraid I'll talk in my sleep. I'm five, in case you forget. Thought of everything. NUMBER FIVE: How did he contact you? By phone. And he sent me airline tickets and instructions. You mean you never saw him until today? Uh-uh. You? Same. How do we know he's on the level? You know, there's something about him that's very strange. I don't even know why I'm here. Well, I know why I'm here. $50,000. That's what the man said. That's it. He's pretty cagey. NUMBER FIVE: What do you think it will be? I don't know. The way he's covered himself, it's got to be Fort Knox. With seven guys? Could be something special. [MUSIC PLAYING] NUMBER ONE: I can understand your curiosity. Today I'll start answering some of your questions. Now if this seems to be even more confusing, Don't let it worry you. It'll soon be made quite clear. Outside this building, there are shacks Denoting the positions indicated on this board. Is that clear? No, I'm sorry. Maybe I'm thick or something. But I've got to know in plans, just what are we going to hit? A town. You mean, something in a town. No. I mean a town. MAN: You mean a bank? There are two banks there, among other things. Two banks? I mean, we're going to hit a whole town. We're going to keep it for three hours And peel it like an orange. Whew. A whole town? And, to be precise, two banks, two supermarkets, A machine shop, and a lumberyard. It'll be on Friday, which is mid-month payday. And that's worth... That's worth, my friend, between a million two And a million four. This is no ordinary town, gentlemen. This is a new model city... Fat, relaxed, and unsuspecting. But how can a handful of us take a whole town? One wold can maul a whole flock of sheep. Imagine what seven can do. [ENGINE REVVING] [POLICE SIREN] POLICE OFFICER: Pull over! BUGGY DRIVER: I nearly piled up my buggy! What the hell is it, Pete? Trying to be big man? Want to be the big gun in town? Got nothing better to do with your time. Pig! Back off. You listen real good, punk. I don't know how many people you nearly killed... Don't give me that. You and your pot-smoking friends are grounded. You read me? Old man, there's gonna be a scene, Pete. A bad scene. You do that, jerk. You tell your old man. I don't give a damn. Now let's settle this once and for all. Is Pete Anderson to stay on as chief, Or do we get us a new man? Look, the question here is whether we establish That this town is run by its council or its chief of police. Now, now. Don't get emotional. In my opinion, Pete Anderson is a first class Officer of the law. It isn't easy to get men of his caliber. Nobody doubts his qualification as chief, but... Well, what we mean is he lacks the proper respect Due to this council. I don't like the way he handled a particular... You mean he won't compromise his office For the whims of some of the city fathers. Are you accusing me of arbitrarily using my office? If the shoe fits. Now let's be rational. Mr. Mayor, I move that the council consider the dismissal Of Pete Anderson as police chief, And the appointment of a committee To seek a new man for the job. Very well. The council has a resolution before it. [BUZZ] Yes? FEMALE VOICE (ON PHONE) Chief Anderson is here, Mr. Mayor. Oh, fine. Have him come in, will you? Oh. And call the station and have Officer Harris report to me right away. Thank you. Morning, Pete. Sit down, will you? Well, bad news, I suppose. I'm sorry to tell you it is. No on occasion for more men? No raise in salary for me? More than that, Pete. What else could it be? We've only got two police cars. We don't even have a decent jail. What happens when something really hits this town? Wellerton is a model city. We are a good safe distance from big cities and big city crime. And Pete, why, I've known you for a long time. I've always been highest respect for you. Get to it, Mr. Mayor. All right. The council wants your resignation. So that's it. It was their idea. I was against it. They say why? Maybe they just feel that the town needs a change. So what is it, Mr. Mayor? Am I being fired for being a lousy cop? Oh, no. You're a damn good cop. Best there is for the money, in my book. But you've ruffled too many feathers, Pete. You see, this town is going places. It's received national attention that it's A nice, quiet, progressive town, great for tourists. We don't want to rock the boat, you know. We don't want to cast any doubts on our future, right? Mm-hm. Like having a decent police force. When the time comes, somebody spots this town for a pushover. Now, it's that kind of talk, Pete. Scaring people, making them think The Mafia will be here any day. And Pete, another thing. You sometimes step down pretty hard on people. Take those kids, for instance. You were pretty hard on them. So that's it. Pot-smoking punks. I don't know. I guess I thought the law would find everybody. Maybe I'm trying too hard. I spent most of my life in these parts... eleven years As deputy sheriff, six years as chief. What do I do now, Mayor? Flush it down the pipes and forget it? I want to tell you, Pete, that on your resignation, There will be nothing on the record That the council reprimanded you in any way, Or that you had any action taken against you. Sure does seem strange. Yes? SECRETARY: Officer Harris is on his way, Mr. Mayor. Oh. Thank you. I thought he'd be OK until the council Decides what they want to do. Well, just when am I supposed to resign? Well, that's more or less up to you. All right. Finish up the week, I'll be out by Friday. Pete, do you mind Officer Harris explaining? OK. So? Remember, I meant it. You're still number one in my book. And if you ever need a recommendation, you've got it. To hell with the council. Thanks. Pete, do you know whether you're going to stay on in town Or not? I don't know. I really don't know. Hi, Pete, what's up? You're kidding. Nope. I've got another surprise for you. Oh, and what's that? You've got my job until the town Council decides what to do. It's a little early in the morning for a bad joke. What joke? I'm out, you're in. Pete. Why? I don't know. I guess I rub some people the wrong way. You better watch your step. They're hungry for chiefs around here. They eat 'em for breakfast. Pete, I don't know if I can handle... I can't pull it off. I can't do your job. I've never had that much responsibility in my life. Just relax. Take it easy. Besides, according to the mayor, nothing exciting Ever happens in Wellerton. [MUSIC PLAYING] [GUNFIRE] Now you must remember, everything Is exact timing and coordination. Now the county seat is 75 miles from here, which leaves us Approximately three safe hours to complete the mission. Now all our objectives are within a radius Of three blocks. Now let's take an order. Number two? Three and I blow the road north of town. Right. As we approach from the south, we All first take care of the south road. You and three will be in charge of the plastiques. Number four? Five and I take care of the telephone exchange. NUMBER ONE: Allowing ten minutes for number six. Seven and I take the police station. Right. Now there's a police chief and three officers. One will be on duty. The other three will be in their respective homes having lunch. You must call them down to the station. And don't forget, you have only 10 minutes before four and five Knock out the phone lines. And then... On the way in from the road, we blow the power station. NUMBER ONE: Correct. And now the town is an island. Cut off from the rest of the world. MAGGIE: Pete? Pete, are you just going to sit out here and drink all night? Maybe. Won't change anything. Mm-hm. MAGGIE: Will, come say goodnight to your father. You all set for bed, boy? Sure, Dad. Dad, is it true what they say about your quitting as chief? That's right, son. But why? Oh, I don't know. Maybe I thought we ought to move on, maybe to a big city. You mean it? Sure, wouldn't you like that? Lot more excitement than here in Wellerton. Gee, I don't know, Dad. Well, don't let it worry you. I haven't made up my mind about anything. You hop off to bed, huh? Dad, since you're off the force now, can I hit him? Can I? You sure can, boy. Hit him one for me, too. Pete, I don't like it. You're telling Will he can go ahead And get into fights at school? Well, at least he can hit back at them. You give them 17 years, and not just because a couple Of no-account people want the town for themselves... Let them have it. Did you mean what you said to Will about pulling out? Maybe. But you've been here all your life. It's all know. Why should we move? We've got roots here. You're not a kid anymore, Pete. How are you going to find another job? I'm a man, aren't I? I've got arms and legs. I can work. What do you think I am? [MUSIC PLAYING] [GUNFIRE] Still at Jack in the Box. What do you mean? I mean, we know what to do when we hit this place, But how do we get in? And how do we get out? Matter of fact, we don't even know the name of the place, Or where it is. I'll tell you one thing. Nobody's ever pulled a job like this before. Every cop in the world will be out for us. Wherever it is, we've got to get the hell out fast. It's crazy. Maybe he's crazy. Yeah, like a fox. What do you really think? I mean about him, our fearless leader? Hell, I don't know. Sometimes I think he's a brain, a real genius. Then other times I wonder, what am I Doing in the desert playing cops and robbers with some loony? I know what you mean. Got to admit, he's got guts. He's got ours, if this thing doesn't work Out exactly the way he figures it. It's a chance, hitting a whole town. But I like it. It's got class. Know what I mean? So it's kind of wild. Let's face it, my line is not exactly Soft touches and easy deals all the way. Of course, I agree. And it's that element of surprise. I like that too. Well, I hope you guys don't think I sell pencils for a living. Talk about surprise. You should have seen this bag that I... Easy, now. No places, no names. Nothing for us to know about each other. Quite right. Our own ignorance is our best insurance policy. Well, I'm getting a little itchy With these gloves on all the time and this suit. Well, the price is right. Yeah, over a million. But I don't know. Can a plain, ordinary town be worth that kind of cash? Or not. Take 5,000 or 6,000 average working people, Give them a couple hundred bucks every two weeks. Figure it out. Already did. It's a million, easy. You mean that that kind of money is lying around in small towns All over the country, and nobody ever Thought of this kind of hit before? It does excite the imagination. Consider the possibilities. Different town every month. We could retire in a year. It's all right with me. In a year's time, do you think we can get around To calling each other by first names? These numbers are getting to me. Gentlemen? Yes, yes? Six and seven? Good night. See you in the morning. How about it man? Should we turn in too? Yeah, I guess. You know, you think that they'd let You call me Pancho or Algernon. Anything than a damn number. NUMBER ONE: You've learned well, gentlemen. Your move into each location is perfectly coordinated. There will be three teams. Team leaders will be two, four, and six. Keep in contact through these radios. I will be carrying one, but you mustn't depend on them. I can't risk this entire mission or something Stupid like static or a mechanical breakdown. Remember, timing is still the vital factor. Is that understood? Yeah. But where are we going and how do we get there? NUMBER ONE: All right, gentlemen. To satisfy your curiosity, we take a town called Wellerton, Which is within 500 miles of where we're standing right now. OK. How do we get there? Well, you won't find out until tomorrow When we're about to leave. Meanwhile, there's just today to continue your training. I want you to do it over and over and over again, Until it's completely automatic. Is that clear? Very well. Team leaders? Hi, Pete. Oh, hi, Frank. Just coming to see you. Oh. What can I do for you? Well, I guess you heard. Yeah. Something about you and some of the council, huh? Uh-huh. I'm out. Yeah, if you ask me, it's a dirty rotten shame. Well, thanks. I expect Maggie and me will be moving on. You're leaving Wellerton? Yeah. Anyway, I wanted to give you notice. Rent' due on the first of the month. Sure hate to see you go. Well, you'll get somebody to rent the house. I don't mean that. That's no problem. I hate to see you leaving like this. I guess life's like that. Where are you... Where are you going? I don't know. Gonna hand in my badge tomorrow, and then we'll Go over to the county seat and have a look around. Look, Pete, why don't you stick around for awhile? You know, everybody in this town is your friend. I mean it. Oh, well, maybe some of those old codgers on the council Don't see eye to eye with you, but come next election, There are going to be some changes made around here. Well, thanks, Frank. But I can't afford to wait around for an election. Besides, I wouldn't want to try something different, at least Not my own hometown, you know? You sure you won't change your mind? Well now, don't worry. Like you say, things might change. I might be able to come back. You bet. And believe me, I'm going to be one guy that's Going to be talking around here because this is a dirty deal. Thanks, Frank. I'll see you before we go. You sure will. NUMBER ONE: Now then. The bank, the phone company, power station, machine shop, The business center, which is on the side street, And the lumberyard. You have to pass the auto gate in order To get to the paymaster's window. Clear? How about all the other places? Small change, and too much time involved. If at all possible, avoid any killings. If you have to shoot, aim low. We just want to take the cream, and then out. Now I just said all that. Pow out. Be patient, my friend. We travel first class, in and out. All right, guys. Let's do it again. [MUSIC PLAYING] [GUNFIRE] Mm-hm. You bet. Honey, like I told you, as of tomorrow I take over. Honey, they're not going to dig up a new chief overnight. OK. OK, I promise. We'll set the date for certain. Mm-hm. I told you, he's out. I mean, really out. As of tomorrow, you're talking to the new chief. Honey, look. Something just came up. I'll talk to you later. That's Ginny. You know how it is with women. She'll all in the air about my taking over as chief tomorrow. Yeah, I know, Hank. It's OK. Anything I can do? Huh? Oh, no. I just thought I'd come in and clean out my desk. Suddenly I feel lousy. Yeah. Well, that's the way it goes sometimes, Hank. I guess it just proves you shouldn't Get too used to anything. Maybe I ought to quit, too. Show those old buzzards... Oh, no. Somebody's got to keep the peace. You'll do fine. I don't know. I don't know if I can. Sure you will. I'll check out tomorrow morning. Pete, look. Suppose something comes up that I can't handle. Who can I turn to? Well, Hank, the county seat's an hour and a half away. You can call the sheriff's office there for help anytime. You know that. Yeah. I guess I could do that. Well, think about it. Wellerton. Population, 7,000. Now what could happen here that you couldn't handle? I guess you're right. Get a good night's sleep. Tomorrow's just another Friday. [MUSIC PLAYING] Very neat. Neat indeed. Thanks for visiting. I wouldn't be surprised if they had their own navy. NUMBER ONE: Check your belongings, gentlemen. Can't afford to leave anything behind. Everything OK? Buckle your seat belts and relax. We have a two-hour flight ahead of us. In case you're wondering, our destination Is a remote farm about 20 miles from the town. I was afraid to ask. I thought you'd set this thing down On the main street of the town. I was considering it. But a helicopter's a little too difficult to obtain. An airplane is much easier to steal. Honest, Pete. We're going to miss you. Thanks, Phil. I'll stop by once in a while, see how things are. Pete, you... you and Maggie want to come over and have dinner With Ginny and me tomorrow night? Oh, not this time, Hank. We'll be out of town this weekend. Fact is, I'm checking out right now. Here it is. Well, I guess that's all there is to it. Short and simple. There's nothing short or simple about the years That you spent here, Pete. Thanks, Hank. You take it easy. You too, Phil. Well, I'll be seeing you. [MUSIC PLAYING] One of them small planes bust a little low, I guess. Thought I heard something. You know, maybe they're having a little trouble. I better go outside and look around. FARMER'S WIFE: Sit down and drink your coffee. You know, you can't go running around Every time you hear a plane going over. OK, Mildred. OK. You win. Now then. Two and three, check the barn. Six and seven, the back of the house, four and five, Come with me. Be careful. It's just supposed to be the farmer and his wife. But we can't take anything for granted. How do you know there aren't any others? As of two weeks ago, when the Acme Construction Company made a telephone survey. Ready? All right. Move out fast. [MUSIC PLAYING] I wonder who that could be? Didn't hear anybody pull up. [KNOCK ON DOOR] You don't suppose that plane I saw... [KNOCK ON DOOR] Oh, please excuse us. Our plane just had a forced landing. I'm Colonel Carruthers of the Adams Air Base. May we please use your phone? Oh, sure, sure. I guess so. Come right in. The phone's right over there. Certainly do appreciate that. Forced landing, eh? [INAUDIBLE] Air Force. We're not exactly the Air Force. Hey, what are you fellows up to? Now take it easy. Don't you try anything foolhardy. Send in two and three. Mildred! What do you fellows want? There's not much money here. Relax. You won't be hurt. You'll just be tied up and locked In a room for a couple of hours. That's all. MALE VOICE: There's a truck in the barn. Oh yes. We're going to borrow your truck and your car. OK, boys. Make them comfortable and secure. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hi, honey. Hi. It's over. Sure you still want to leave town? For a while, anyway. A change of scene will do us good. You tell the school? I'll go pick him up now. [MUSIC PLAYING] Want anything special for lunch? [CAR STARTS] [MUSIC PLAYING] PHIL: Hey, Hank. You want to take lunch first? Nah. You go ahead. I've got all this paperwork to figure out. Ready. Easy now! Hands over your head. OK, friend, now let's get the other cops on the phone. I said move!

OK, that's one less to worry about. Come on, let's go. [MUSIC PLAYING] You stay here, Will. NUMBER FOUR: This is four and five to six and seven. Do you read me? Over. Very clear. Everything here OK. You may disconnect. NUMBER FOUR: This is four to six. I read you. We will now disconnect. Over and out. [MUSIC PLAYING] What took you so long? Had to make sure all the boards were dead. I'd say the phone company's out of business. [MUSIC PLAYING] [BOOM] I never thought I'd live to see the day. This is Leader One to six and seven. Do you read me? NUMBER SIX: This is six to Leader One. I read you loud and clear. All the birds are caged Right. We're coming for you. NUMBER SIX: Coming now. NUMBER TWO: This is two and three to Leader One.

Just tell me what you saw. MAGGIE: A holdup. Where? The bank. The market, too, I think. Pete! Pete, you can't. There are too many of them. Stay here until they're gone. Oh, why, Pete? Why the hell do you want to do it? For them? For this stinking town? They don't care. What kind of a man are you? You got me and you've got your son. You're going to go out and get yourself killed? For what, Pete? For what? You stay here, you understand? Take care of your mother, son. This is Two to Leader One. This is One. Some guys' got us picked out with a shotgun. NUMBER ONE: All right. See to it that he doesn't interfere with the other teams. OK. Over and out. Everybody inside! Lock your doors! Hey! Hey over here! Hello there! Pete! Boy, am I glad to see you. How'd you get in there? They took us by surprise. There's a whole bunch of them. They're pretty smart. Yeah, I noticed. Where's the key? They got them. They got all of them. They got our guns, too. Well, I can't take time to get you out of there now. Listen, don't be crazy. I tell you, there's a whole gang of them. I know. They're trying to loot the town. So, get us out and we'll all go after them. I'll get you something to work on that lock. Pete, I keep telling you. There's one... PETE: Johnny! (WHISPERS) Johnny, come here. Come here. Chief, what's happening? It's a bunch of holdup men. They're trying to take over the town. Listen, I want you to do something for me. Gee, I don't know. Snap out of it! I want you to go get old man Weatherby, the locksmith. Bring him to the jail, and tell him to open that cell door. Understand? Now come on. Get going! This is Leader One to teams six and seven. NUMBER SIX: This is 6 to Leader One. Are you finished? NUMBER SIX: On our way over to the second bank. Just leaving the machine shop. Cancel that and report to me. Speed it up. And there's some guy out there with a shotgun. Let's go. Where's three? He's had it. That guy with the shotgun I told you about. [GUNFIRE] Idiots. They let one man ruin everything. [EXTENDED GUNFIRE] Open the door. Let me in. Go away. I don't want any trouble. It's Pete Anderson. Open the door! I don't care who it is. Go away! [GUNFIRE] [GROANS] [MACHINE GUN FIRE] [GROANS] Come on, get in. Close the door. Stop the car. Shut up and close the door. Hey, Pete Anderson's wounded. One man with a lousy shotgun. That's not bad if you ask me. Well, we missed the second bank and the market. I don't think we took half of what we should have. And we lost three men. We still took the town, like we planned. Well, we took it. And lost it. To one man. Better get to him, Doc. He'll need to do some talking. You all right, Pete? Yeah, sure. All right, folks. Let's go on home now. It's all over. [CHATTER] Better keep an eye on him. Should get the sheriff's office down here. You're going to need help. Right. Jack? Call the county seat. Tell them what's happened. JACK: But Hank, all the phones are out. I don't care if you get in the car and drive over there. Well, the bridge has been out. I tried it about a half an hour ago. I don't care if you walk. Get in your car and drive around the bridge, but do something. Phones are out. Power's been out all day. What happened to us? Are we a disaster area? They hit us real hard. Thanks, Doc. Pete! You're hurt. No, I'm OK. Jack, how is he? JACK: He'll be all right. I'll bet he's got some interesting answers. All right we don't have much time. Start counting. [SIRENS] [MORE SIRENS] Sheriff, I'm glad to see you. Well, I don't mind telling you I Had one hell of a time getting here. OK. What about your prisoner? Got him all passed up for you. We're taking him to the county seat. We can keep him here. He'd be perfectly safe. He would, huh? The governor is on my neck. The FBI is standing by right now waiting for a phone call From me. Does this phone work? Well, no, sir. We just got the electricity an hour ago. That's just beautiful. All right. Get on the radio, tell Woodson we got our man. We should be there in about, oh, two hours. This is one of the birds, is it? Take good care of him. Sir, I don't get it. The governor? The FBI? What do you think this is, a traffic ticket, son? We got a five standard arm out for them. The way I heard it, they damn near Skinked your whole town out. Would have, too, except for Pete Anderson. By the way, where is he? He's at home, I guess. Oh. Well, tell him to come and see me when he gets in. Yes, sir. I want a full written report on this. Yes, sir. Uh, sir? Would you mind signing the release for the prisoner? Get yourself a haircut, will ya? And I don't want that report tomorrow. I want it on my desk tonight. Understand? Yes, sir. [SIREN] Well, I've kept my end of the bargain. You've all been paid. Now after you land, you'll shave. You each have your own clothes. Don't forget... Bury your jumpsuit, The parachute, and the shaver. The guns and the walkie-talkies stay here. We're now over 500 miles from Wellerton, Which is way beyond any roadblock. Remember, I want you each to jump at 15-minute intervals, Which will be about 50 miles apart.

I've just left the governor and he's plenty burned. Right now, you're set for a one-way stretch of nothing Less than 199 years. And I'm not kidding. Your friends? They made off with close to half a million, and we want it back. And we want your friends back. Now you got yourself just one thin haul. That's all. If you help us, we'll help you. Those are the governor's own words. Now how about it? Just leave him alone with me. I'll... Am I to take it that you're not interested in saving Your own neck? Oh, now, I wouldn't exactly say that. What exactly would you say? Now let me get this straight. If I cooperate with you, tell you everything I know, You're going to give me a break, right? Right. What about cigarettes and magazines? All right, all right. What about a television set? Right. Now. Well. I think you're going to be awful disappointed. I don't really know as much as you think I do. We'll be the judge of that. My name is Arnold. Mike Arnold. For the last week, I've been known by the number four. None of us had any names. Just numbers. Who was the leader? He was number 1! [MUSIC PLAYING] Good evening, Pete. You see, they're here and came to you. Just like I said. What can I do for you, gentlemen? Well, Pete, this is kind of like eating crow. Oh, good evening, Mrs. Anderson. MAGGIE: Good evening. Shall I bust the sign up, Pete? PETE: Hold on, Frank. What is it you want to see me about? Pete, we want you to stay here with us. PETE: I see. Look at this, Pete. Take it back, will you? PETE: I'm not sure, Mr. Mayor. Pete, heaven's sake. Yesterday you went down that street right in the middle Of it, and you made fools of everyone on the council. Is that why you think I did it, for the council? Well, it's just a figure of speech. Now look here, Anderson. You can't just walk off and leave town. I mean, after all, after what happened, you... well, We'll all look like a bunch of idiots. Now just a minute. I didn't do it to spite the council. And I didn't do it to save the honor of the town. MAYOR: Why did you do it? I don't know. But I guess if I have to explain it, Maybe it wasn't worth doing after all. MAYOR: I don't understand, Pete. NEWS ANNOUNCER: This is David Lionel in the small town Of Wellerton, where the daring daylight Attack continues to baffle authorities. All law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, Are withholding information pending further investigation. What is known is that two of the men were killed, And one captured singlehandedly by Wellerton's Former police Chief Anderson. A five-state alarm has closed all possible avenues of escape, And an early capture of the bandits is expected. I'm here with Acting Chief Hank Harris. Chief Harris, how has this affected your town? VICTOR ATCHISON: All right now. Let's go through it again. Where exactly were you trained? I told you. I don't know. Somewhere in the desert. Weren't there some kind of landmarks? Yeah. Sagebrush and sand and cactus. If you went through a mug file, could You identify any of these men? I doubt it. We all wore beards. Was there ever a name, a place, something we could go on? Not that I can remember. How about something on the TV? What do you want to see? I don't care. Anything's better than your sheriff. Yes sir. How far are you going? As far as I can get. SHERIFF: We've got a call out for all aircraft reported Stolen or missing during the last two days. When we get our hands on that thing, We're going to be a lot closer to unraveling this mess. VICTOR ATCHISON: I don't know. I don't know. The man that planned this is a master criminal. He's a genius. Now he's covered himself so well I wouldn't be surprised If we never find the plane, or in fact The place where these men were trained. What are you trying to tell me, that this Is some kind of a perfect crime? No. Uh-uh. No. It's brilliant, but I don't think it's perfect. Now there's got to be a flaw someplace. Like what? Like, for instance, this man. Arnold. Number four. Let's assume he's telling the truth. Each of these men didn't know each other. Each was a total stranger to the other. Except for the ringleader, who hired them all. Yes. Exactly. Except for Number 1. Now if we could find him, he could lead us to the others. Hm. That's kind of like looking for the needle in a haystack, Isn't it? That's the weak link. It's the only one we have to go on. If only he could help us find the top man.
