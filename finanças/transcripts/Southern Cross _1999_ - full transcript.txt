[PIANO MUSIC] [MUSIC STOPS] [MUSIC PLAYING] [SHOUTING IN SPANISH] Felipe, please don't go down. We closed the mine because it's not safe. Of course it's safe. We must get these men back to work. You, my friend, are crazy. That's right, but I was born a Solano-- not my choice, my friend. Buenos dias. Buenos dias. Ah, Marcos! I'll see if it's working. [SPEAKING SPANISH] Let's go! [EXPLOSION] [PIANO MUSIC] I guess the only grant I could apply for now is federal disaster relief. Thank you. Next, Miss Hopkins. One moment. Mr. Solano, do you really want to do this as a career? I love music. You are gifted. You chose the most difficult of pieces. Thank you. It was not on the list. And he didn't play the required Chopin. If you'd bothered to look at his resume, you'd see he's a dilettante. We have one more audition. Come back next Wednesday. MALE JUDGE: With the Chopin. Wednesday, thank you. [GUN SHOTS] [SCREAMING] All right, it's just another day in Boston. [HEAVY ROCK MUSIC] [KNOCKING] Hello? Hello! Hello! Gee, I'm sorry. The bedroom's right over there. To your right? The bathroom has a shower, and-- What exactly are you proposing? Uh, if I were you, I'd make an offer pretty quick. You're here to see the apartment, right? No, I'm here to see you. Philip Solano? I'm a lawyer. Oh God no, it can't be that bad. I mean, I can explain about the credit cards. Can I get you something to drink? Listen, we've got juice. We've got water. MARIANA: No, thanks. I'm Mariana Flores, you're lawyer. I'm here about the estate of your father Felipe Solano. Estate? I mean, Felipe Solano, huh? Yes. I'm sorry, he died. He was killed in a mine accident two weeks ago. He had no will. Under Chilean law, as a [SPANISH PHRASE], a natural child, you have rights. Natural child-- yeah, my mother would have liked that. Very sixties, you know? At least it's better than bastard. There is one other heir, your half sister. She will get 2/3 of the estate. Wait a minute. So I have a sister. How about that? How old is she? 21. It would help if you have any photos, any personal letters from him, something that he gave you. Well, the only thing he ever gave me was money for my mother to have me aborted, all right? Wait a minute, why am I telling you this? Who are you again? I told you. I'm here to represent you? So what's in it for you? 25%. 25% of what? What exactly are we talking about here? At least 10 million. -Pesos? -Dollars. Man! OK, let's go. Good. This is great. I get to meet my sister. And I've never been to Chile. No, no, no-- it's not possible for you to go. What? I haven't planned on this. I've got to be back here by Wednesday, all right? So I'll go to the hearing. I'll-- I'll sign the papers, and then meet my sister, and-- Please, Philip, why don't you just sign these papers and let me take care of this? No, I'm going to Chile. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SPEAKING IN SPANISH] I thought you killed him in Boston. Look. There's your sister, Patricia. And her husband, Lorenzo. She's beautiful. Yeah, smart too, except when it comes to picking men. That's Garrison Carver, your father's partner, the one that looks like Lenin. He owns 49% of Soldeca. Felipe had the controlling 51%. Both of them needs your share to control the company. That's only if Patricia and this Carver guy disagree. MARIANA: They will. Why are they just burying him now? They only reached his body Friday. They're still searching. [SHOUTING IN SPANISH] Miners-- they blame your father for closing the mine. Hola. JUDGE: [SPEAKING SPANISH] The judge will take weeks to figure out the documents. Hi. How dare you insult my wife and family like this. Hey, hey-- wait! What did I say? This is Felipe's son. What a handsome young man. You must have your mother's eyes. Thank you. Garrison Carver. You'll have to excuse the family. They just went through an emotional time. Felipe never told them that they had a son. Well, never told me either. What do you say you come by my office. We'll look at these papers and talk. Mariana, you know where the office is. Hm! Philip, whatever you do, don't sign anything. I haven't-- yet. [SINISTER MUSIC] -I'll wait for you outside. -OK. GARRISON: I shipped out of Halifax, Canada, when I was 14. I ended up in Hong Kong, Kowloon side, working in a bar. I wasn't much better than a slave. The owner had one of these machines, but he wouldn't let me touch it. Only sailors and whores. I saw this machine in Bangkok last month. Identical machine, so I bought it. Ah, you see? Tilt doesn't mean anything when you own the game. That's one of life's cruder lessons. What do you think about money, Philip? They say it's the root of all evil. The lack of money is the root of all evil. I came to Chile with a lot of money to invest. Now I have a bankrupt company and very little money. Creditors have taken just about everything. I wouldn't let them take this. Nah. 25,000, a new record. Here, you try. Are you saying Soldeca's bankrupt? Totally. Come on, play. I insist. PHILIP: Hey, my lawyer says that there's millions in the estate. Of course she'd say that. As long as she has you, she can keep us locked up in court. Nobody will invest. We'll be ruined. I tell you what, why don't you play for it. $10 a point-- hell, I just racked up 25,000 points. OK, I'll give you $100,000 no matter what you score. You can't lose. OK, but if I break your record, I keep the machine. Play. New piano-- Didn't you say it was pesos? Why don't we just make it $400,000? GARRISON: $2,000 in cash, and a check for $400,00, and you're on the last flight out of here tonight. [BIG BAND MUSIC] -Philip Solano? -Yes. Please, this way. Mariana has a car waiting for her. It's OK, [INAUDIBLE]. So children won't fall out. Felipe never had a son. I was a son to him, though he didn't appreciate it. A court case would make dirty the Solano family name. So for once, gringo, crime pays. PHILIP: Wait a minute. This is $100,000. LORENZO: This is real. I'm a man of my word. Sign. Fuck. OK, OK Lorenzo. Bien. You plane leaves for the United States tonight. Don't be late. Believe me, nothing in the world will keep me from getting on that plane. Your money will be delivered to you when you get on the plane. Um, could you guys drop me off at-- [GROAN] [SPEAKING SPANISH] No, the American consul. Yes. [PIANO MUSIC] Oh my God, I thought it was your father for a moment. Did he write this? It's beautiful. Although in the fourth bar, there's a drop cadence that I'd change. MARIANA: Now where were you? I've been waiting for hours. I made a deal with Carver. What? How could you do that? $400,000, that's how. And when the check clears, I'll send you your fee. But you can get 20 times more from the estate. Soldeca's bankrupt. -Of course he'll tell you that. -No, I was there. I was in his office. It was empty. They had taken everything. Soldeca owns the building. Carver's moving into Felipe's bigger office. What are you talking about? Well it's a bird in hand. I wasn't born with a silver spoon in my mouth like you. This is enough for me. Philip, there is so much more at stake here than you know about. Oh yeah, I heard. There's a lot more than I know. I'm talking about 5,000 miners out of work and their families. Carver will shut down the coal mine. But your father wanted it reopened, because he cared about these people. Hm, how touching. A caring man. By an accident of birth, you have the chance to help thousands of families. If I just sign your paper, right? Yes, and I'll forget my fee. Really? The answer's still no. So if you're just here for the money, then I want to show you something. It's on the way to the airport. Let's go. You'll find all your father's private accounts in these two ledgers and all his bank accounts in this computer file. You were right, I found at least $6 million in Swiss accounts so far. Just keep adding. I don't believe this. Please, could you just leave me alone for a second? Sure. PHILIP'S MOTHER: (VOICEOVER) This month's check was late, and I need more for his piano lessons. As I've made clear to you before, Philip thinks that Richard Bishop is his father, and any attempt to communicate with Philip would destroy the boy. When you walked out on us, you gave up any right to consider him your son. Neither your money or your pleas to see him can change what you did to me and to him. My God, she lied-- lied about everything to do with him, told him I believed another man was my real father. Why? He was the one supporting us. He paid my education! She told me it was her rich aunt in Switzerland. What was he really like? Did he talk about me? Yes, he did. You don't have to lie now. It's the truth. You're a lot alike-- not on the outside, but the inside-- the way you play, and your feelings. Let's go. No, no, no. What do you mean, no? No, I'm staying in Chile. -What? -That's right. This is not about money anymore, or my audition. What is it about, then? It's about family. It's about my father. It's about me. Please, Philip. Listen, I'm going to find out everything I can about my father. No, you don't want to know. Look, I don't mean everything, Philip, it was probably not an accident. Are you saying he was murdered? Who do you think did it? That's the problem-- too many suspects and not enough evidence. Well then, all the more reason to find out. Philip, wait! It's that whoever did it won't hesitate to kill again. Just sign the paper! Get on the plane, Philip. No. You're an impossible, stubborn gringo, aren't you? [SPEAKING SPANISH] And you're a cold hearted, mercenary bourgeois bitch. Is that the worst you can think of? You're-- you're a-- you're a lawyer. What is it? Oh, it's nothing. Actually, I thought I had good news for you. He didn't show up at the airport. I knew that. You thought you could go around me and buy him? I made an offer on behalf of Patricia, your wife. You can't buy a Solano. Yeah, maybe not buy exactly, but persuade-- on the basis of family. He signed over his rights to me, so my wife and I have the 51%. Let me see that. This is obviously an agreement, but these last three handwritten words-- one starts with a P-H, and the last one with an O, but pardon my Greek. I could swear it says "Phuck you Lorenzo." Philip's obviously your brother and a Solano. [MUSIC PLAYING] Uh, excuse me. Do you know where the newspaper-- [INAUDIBLE]. Thanks a lot. This is incredible. WOMAN: My great uncle started this newspaper more than 100 years ago. We have photos in our archive from the last century. PHILIP: It's amazing. WOMAN: We have many Solano pictures. Here. This is your great, great grandfather. I can see resemblances. You've come to the right place to learn about your family history. [INAUDIBLE] and Solano have been always together like a married couple, better or worse. The mine is the heart of this town. And when the heart stopped beating, the body dies. That's sad. Soldeca says that next week will be my last edition. When the board of director meets to sign the town death certificate, they say that the mine and the paper are losing money. The truth is, Philip, we're just about breaking even. There is no future in peat mining, that's for sure. Yeah, it's pretty horrible work. But when you're born to it, that's all you know. We must fine some other industry. But for now, the mine must be reopened. It's all we have. There is a reason you're here now. God never make mistakes. You can help save this town. You're a Solano. [MUSIC PLAYING] [WEEPING] PHILIP: You sure there's none? You didn't see another [INAUDIBLE], anyone at all? [SPEAKING SPANISH] All right, OK. PHILIP: You said I could help save this town. How could I possibly do that? As the Solano heir, you will demand the mine be reopened-- front page. Every time I say the name Solano here, people want to lynch me. They will love you if you help save this town. I'll be right back. [SPEAKING SPANISH] PHILIP: Hey Chavela, will you take a look at this? [SPEAKING SPANISH] Smile. I don't care what anyone says. I want to talk to him. Lorenzo won't like it. But he's my brother. He's all the family I've got. Yeah, we'll I'm not totally convinced of his authenticity. I'd be careful if I was you. Ah, it's about time. [YELLING] What's wrong? Lorenzo? What is wrong with you? Surprised to see me alive? Get away from me. Get away! Stop it! You [INAUDIBLE] in my own house with my own wife. Hey, you invited him for a breakfast meeting. We didn't know where you were. Yeah, well who else would want me killed? Who else? What are you talking about? One of your men tried to kill me. That is ridiculous. Come on. Come on. Who else? Well at least 10 husbands in town that I can name. I'm sorry, Patricia. Thank you. That's it. LORENZO: Patricia! Patricia! Don't be afraid of losing her, Lorenzo. Be afraid of losing everything you have, because you haven't looked after business. The first shipment arrives next week, and the minister has not approved the permit. He will approve it, I guarantee it. Oh, you guarantee it. Yes, I guarantee it. He's worried about the press, what they'll say about the nuclear waste we're putting into the mines. Well you tell him not to worry about the press. I can look after the press. What I am afraid of is young Solano running around Colota alive. He is our real threat. No one is going to believe another accident with a Solano. Well, it doesn't have to be an accident. He can just disappear. He has no real family to miss him or inquire about him. You were good at people disappearing. It's what you used to do in the army, right? Here it is. Yep. Yes! Roberto Zamorena is still alive, and his brother Marcos. What the hell's going on? There is no answer. You're sure you got the right number. Of course. Well then hang up and try again. Hang up! [PHONE RINGING] Yes. OK. [MUSIC PLAYING] Uh, bandidos! [SPEAKING SPANISH]. Uh, Solano-- yes! Whoa, no. Hey, you don't understand. Wait, wait! Excuse me. Hey-- hey, uh-- [SHOUTING IN SPANISH] [PIANO MUSIC] [WHISTLING AND CLAPPING] [SINGING IN SPANISH] [MUSIC STOPS] [CHEERING] Hey. What are you doing here? Well, I was born here. This is my town, my people. No silver spoon. Oscar, this is Philip. You know this guy? What, did you defend him in some murder trial or something? Not yet. Oscar's my uncle, the wealthy side of the family. He had a job. So now you are with the son of Solano, hey princessa? My uncle's old fashioned. He believes in-- in class struggle and all of that. He needs a Solano to hate. Your father was a son of a bitch. You are a son of a bitch, but I like you. Sometimes I don't know where I belong. I know exactly how you feel. Do you know him? Yeah, I knew him. Why? I have a picture of him above ground after the explosion. -Really? -He's alive. What do you know about him? Don't ask me. Ask Rosa over there. Buy her a drink. Um, hola, uh-- hi. I'm Philip, um, you know Mariana. Si? [SPEAKING SPANISH] What'd she say? She said never trust men. Is that all? That does say it all. Rosa, where's-- donde Roberto? -Roberto? -Yes. He's secret-- secreto! PHILIP: Huh? He telephone when [INAUDIBLE]. No telephone. No Roberto. PHILIP: And Marcos-- donde esta Marcos? I'd say that he's long gone from Chile. No, Marcos say [SPEAKING SPANISH]. Chacobuco? Chacabuco. MARIANA: There's a lot of Chacabucos in Chile-- Chacabuco River, Chacabuco Village. There is a Hotel Chacabuco in Santiago, too. [SPANISH]. -What? -Dance. Oh no. Please, no no-- listen, um-- whoa! Yes? Oh, hey-- hi. Excuse me, sir. No, no, por favor. No way, Jose. Oh, you met Jose? He's [INAUDIBLE] our national drink. You don't have any choice. Por favor. Come on, drink it. How do you say designated driver in Spanish. Well I think you're a designated drinker. Come on. [MUSIC PLAYING] No-- when did she get here? Dear Philip-- MARIANA: (VOICEOVER) Your father would be very proud of you, but I know he would want you safe back in Boston. Here is your ticket to fly home. I will let you know what happens with the estate. [GROANS] Donde esta Roberto? Donde esta Roberto? -Donde esta gringo? Philip Solano. -Have a very good trip, sir. -Yeah. That wasn't very nice what you did to me back there. What are you doing here? No, what are you doing here? How could you leave me like that? I was protecting you. Yes, protecting me. Is that why you're taking the only flight that can get you all the way to Chacabuco, for my protection? You have to work with me. No, I don't. You wouldn't have gotten this far without me. Listen, I've written a letter to my sister that turns over my share until they go to her. That means that Lorenzo controls the company and closes the mine. Tickets please. Si. If you agree to be straight with me, and if we can work together, I won't mail it. Hey, excuse me. Uh, por favor. Come on. Gracias, de nada. Is that how you practice law in Chile? No, at University it was an extracurricular activity. By the way, do you know how to use this? Sure, you just point it and shoot like a camera, right? Yeah, just don't ask for a smile first. This is it, Chacabuco. 5,000 people lived here mining nitrates. Your family owned it. PHILIP: What happened? MARIANA: The boom went bust. PHILIP: Well, someone could hide out here for about a year before we'd ever find them. There's row C. 11 must be this way. [MUSIC PLAYING] Well, is this it? Yes. Four men with guns. Over here. OK. Oh-- it's Roberto. Over here. [GUN SHOTS] There's a car. Oh, there goes our ride. Lorenzo. [SHOUTING IN SPANISH]. We gotta go. [MUSIC CHANGES] PHILIP: Go, stop the train. -Stop! Mariana! Mariana! [GUN SHOTS] Donde esta gringo? Donde esta gringo? [SPEAKING SPANISH] MARIANA: There's no use going to the police. Lorenzo will have gotten rid of the body. PHILIP: What about Marcos, Roberta's brother? He's our best chance now. [SPEAKING SPANISH] Who did you call? A fine journalist. He'll be in Santiago. I left a message. What is that? PHILIP: Get a load of this, doesn't look good. What? This is serious. You're in big trouble. -Why? What does it say? Solano heir murders a whore in-- My God, it's Rosa. -Colota Hotel-- -Wait a minute. We need to get out of this town. They know that we were on that train. They will be checking the airport and the bus station. How about a boat? -No, no, look. They're looking for me, OK? What about-- what if you rent a car, is that all right? The police have checkpoints every 50 kilometers on the highways here, and they're looking for us. All right, we'll split up. It's OK. I-- I'll make out. No, I think we are together in this. That's what you wanted, wasn't it? [MOTORCYCLE ENGINE] PHILIP: OK, well change of plans. We better lay low somewhere, travel at night. Let's get some sleep. Hey, come on. You all right? Philip-- I need to tell you something about your father. Oh no-- no please, not now, OK. Just, I don't want to hear it. I don't want to hear another worked. I just-- all I want to know is that you and me right now-- Not now. What? What, is it some sort of professional ethics thing? If that's the problem, then you're fired, OK? It isn't that. I think we should sleep. I'm so tired. OK, OK. I'm just going to sleep. You know what? I'm going to take a cold swim. It would be nice if we could stop the world and get off. It's so beautiful. OK. It seems they're making their way to Valparaiso. They are going to Marcos place. That's right. They're fugitives now. Makes your job a lot easier. My job? That's wonderful. PATRICIA: Thank you. What are you waiting for? Get going. The last time-- this is the last time. [PHONE DIALING] He's on his way. That's right. That must be Marcos's place down there. [KNOCKING] [DOOR CREAKING] MARIANA: Hello? Marcos? Marcos Zamorena? Permiso-- Marcos? There's Rosa, Marcos, and Roberto. PHILIP: In happier times. [BANGING NOISE] I don't know if I'm up to finding another dead body. [LOUD NOISE] Stop! Marcos, stop! I think he went over there. -I'll go that way. You go down there. Hey, stop! Hey! [SPEAKING SPANISH] What? MARIANA: No luck. I must have taken the wrong turn. -Did you see him? -No. [DOOR SLAMMING] You've been lying to me from the start, haven't you? What are you talking about? I saw you talking to him, all right? You told me to go the other way. What the hell, has it been one lie after the other, is that it? -Well you should never have-- You should have never lied to me! OK, I trusted you. MARIANA: Philip, I'm just trying to protect you. Cut the bullshit, huh? Carver was right. Oh god, don't tell me. Don't tell me you had something to do with my father's murder. Lorenzo. They will kill anyone. Who? They killed Marco days ago. -Who are they? -Who? [SPEAKING SPANISH] I can't kill you. Mariana, I beg you. Leave Chile. Leave. This is too big. [INAUDIBLE] [GUN SHOT] Oh my God. Here, hey-- oh-- oh, no. I didn't want it like this. I killed your father. I'm sorry. [SPEAKING SPANISH] [GUN SHOTS] MARIANA: Let's go. There's a car waiting for us. No! No, I'm going to the police, OK? I can explain everything. Why should I trust you? Because whatever we do, we've had it, OK? Let's go. Now, quick! [GUN SHOTS] Ah, fuck! Come on. [SHOUTING IN SPANISH] Damn it! Follow me. Ah! Damn it! Fuck! [GROANING] Fuck! [SPEAKING SPANISH] [DOG BARKING] [MUSIC SWELLS] [MUSIC STOPS] Oh, shit. PHILIP: Hey man, what the hell's going on? The truth this time. You'll know soon, I promise. Come on. Come on, let's go. Gracias I know a way in around the back. I'll open the door for you. Wait for me. [LOUD CLAMORING] [PIANO MUSIC] Welcome, Felipe. I thought you were dead. I thought I'd never see you. Oh God, you've got your mother's looks. God forbid. Oh man, that was a beautiful piece. Thank you, and I know that you play, too. I just wish I had a little more time to work on it. For 30 years, you know? 30 years, I never heard a word from you-- nothing. And now-- now it's convenient for you, I just-- you just used me. You were supposed to be safe in the states. I was told I had a sister and a father who was dead. The great thing about being dead is that you have to let go of the past. Can you do that? But I needed you. I needed a father-- a real father. There aren't too many of those. Felipe, Lorenzo's dead-- shot right in front of us. Carver-- it's not the miners. It's Carver. Why didn't you just tell me? It was crucial that no one knew. I tried to tell you at the beach last night. We must hurry. The border's twelve kilometers from here. It should be a good hike for the full moon. What kind of shoes do you have? Wait a minute. The whole idea was, once we knew, we would go to the press, right? Maybe for the miners, but not for Carver. We're not safe here in Chile. Besides, my son is wanted for murder. And killing me has no consequences. I'm dead already. GARRISON: All this incredible, turn of the century architecture-- everything, all this metal work, it's for sale. And I can get secure government-- MAN: [SPEAKING SPANISH]! Excuse me, show him the plans. What? -We found them? -Where? -In [INAUDIBLE]. They're trying to get into Argentina. Thank you. Thank you. Felipe, um, I don't know what to call you. Call me whatever feels good to you. What feels good is that we all go to Colota. And you see, the press will be there for that board meeting. We'll never make it to that meeting alive. I don't want to lose you again. You're never going to lose me again. You know, it really is a curse being born rich and a Solano. I'm not rich. You will be when I'm dead, huh? Listen, see if you can talk some sense into my son. He wants to go to Colota to be buried in the family plot. He's right, but I'm the one that's going. What, is everybody going crazy around here? We have to stop Carver. We need to open the mine. I can't let you go. I made a promise to your father. My father would expect me to go, and he would expect you to go, too. That settles it. We have no choice. We're going to Colota. Look, you have the right to be complete fools, but not dead fools. Come with us. When you two have come to your senses, I'll be at the German inn in Mendoza. I'll wait for 24 hours. He's walked out again. [THUNDER] [MUSIC PLAYING] You're here to see the apartment, right? I'm here to see you, Philip Solano. I'm used to being a lawyer. GARRISON: Mariana-- in the wrong bed. You know, it's a shame. You could've been with me on the winning side. The two of you have kept my men quite busy. You know, uh, a few of my more unsavory Mexican business partners have this saying, "plata o plomo"-- silver or lead. And you, my son, have chosen to turn down the silver. So what do responsible citizens like us do with a couple of dangerous murderers? You are the murderer. The question is, do we give the police the opportunity of finding your body, or do you just disappear? What do you want? I mean, disappearing could be quite interesting. You mean disappear, like in go to Argentina? I'm kind of attracted to the idea of young lovers escaping through the mountains, both murders. They fall to their death. Yeah, It's got a romantic ring to it. You look after the details, Pedro. Yes sir. I have some pressing corporate obligations. I'm going to enjoy running Soldeca. You know, you two might even become a legend. [CHUCKLING] Move! I'm sorry, Philip. I'm sorry I got you into this. I'm not. I'm not sorry at all-- at least 'til this point. It's not money couples these days commit suicide with their arms tied behind their backs. HENCHMAN: Shut up! Step forward. Why? Why not just put two bullets in me? Let's call it murder, what the hell? [GRUNTING] PHILIP: Go, Mariana Run! [GUN SHOT] [GUN CLICKS] -Fuck! Fuck! [SCREAMING] MARIANA: Philip! PHILIP: Mariana! MARIANA: Philip! Hey, hold on! [GRUNTING] FELIPE: Hello there! Hola. I can't hold on. You've got to! Mariana, just make sure you've got my legs, all right? No, don't-- don't-- don't, you'll fall, too. No, we're going to make it, OK? God, you are stubborn. I can't pull you up. You're going to have to let go of that arm, OK? And grab me with both, all right? I'm slipping. PHILIP: On the count of three- 1, 2, 3! [GROAN] [MUSIC SWELLS] [MUSIC STOPS] [SHOUTING IN SPANISH] GARRISON: The risk of moving hazardous materials is nil. The waste dump site is at the harbor. Now our new-- oh yes, of course. Before we vote, as chairman of Soldeca, I'd like to express the company's great sorrow at the recent losses. And our heart goes out to the families. Would you please join me in observing a moment of silence for these recent deaths, and for the loss of our late chairman, Philip-- uh, Felipe Solano, whose great grandfather had the foresight and vision to erect this historic venture? Can I have that moment now, please? [DOOR OPENING] [GASPS] -Papa! -Good to see you. Firstly, I'd like to thank everyone for their heartfelt condolences. [CHUCKLING] Oh, and your flowers were particularly beautiful. [INAUDIBLE] I'm going to put you away for a long time. [INAUDIBLE]. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SHOUTING IN SPANISH] [SCREAMING] [MACHINERY NOISE]
