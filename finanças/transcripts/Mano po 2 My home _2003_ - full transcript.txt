Wear this ring… As a sign of my love and loyalty. You're asking for our blessing, aren't you ashamed? It's just marriage but couldn't find a decent person. Mom, Antonio's a decent guy. He'll never let you have money. Chinese are like that. He's not pure Chinese. The father of his grandfather… Is a British army officer from China. No matter what you say, he's still Chinese. Do you know that they think of us as lesser beings? He only married you so that he'll be able to stay here in the Philippines. He'll make you his slave. Azon, don't make a big deal out of this. Come on. She married a foreign guy. But got herself a Chinese. And Ising beat you because she got herself an American. But black. But still an American. [thudding sound] Tell your husband to enter, child. Hey, hey, hey. What's that supposed to mean? No. I will leave if you let that man enter my house. Child, maybe, it's not too late… [clunking sound] [background street noise] Dad, I was really certain when I married Antonio. We will stand by our decision. Is that so? Never come to this place again. [background street noise] [crickets chirping] [horses trotting] [horn sound] - Tony, the house is big. - Mama. We might not afford it. Money is easy here in Manila. Don't worry, I'll take care of it. [light music] [music swells] [music continues] [engine revs] After the Christmas party, don't drink, okay? Go back to your jobs. On the 26th, all of these will be shipped to Korea. The delivery, okay? Thank you. I will leave now. Sir, by the way, this is for you from our department. Merry Christmas. [laughs] Thank you. Thank you. Merry Christmas. [background chatter] [background chatter] [thunderstorm] [raining hard] Hello. I will go there, 9 o'clock, okay? Don't leave. Okay, okay. [water splashes] Stop! This a robbery! Where are you going? Give me that. Give me that! You're resisting! [gunshot fired] [sinister music] Let's go now! Fast. Sir. [sorrowful music] Sol. [indistinct murmur] Sol. [phone rings] [rumbling sound] Hello. [raining hard] [cries] [crying] [sad music] Ma'am, where is his clothes? This. [reflective music] What did the police say? Nothing yet. How long does it take? For them to say something? [gentle music] Dad. We're like birds whose wings were ripped from us. It has a huge impact to the children. Mom, how will you deal with this? I'm ready to carry all the responsibility Tony has left. Erickson. [background chatter] Aunt. My condolences, aunt. Thank you Melissa, where's your mom and dad? They are coming. [background chatter] [background chatter] Belinda. Mrs. Chan. - Mrs. Chan. - Father. - I am Father Frejas. - Father Frejas? I am the one who asked for you. [speaks Chinese] Aunt, don't make a big deal out of this. Why am I the one you're talking to about that? Lu Shui is the one creating tension. Maybe you can talk it over. Maybe they can do both ceremonies at the same time. What's the outcome of that? You're letting Lu Shui decide for ourselves. For dad's sake. Your dad knows me. Father, let's proceed with the mass. - But sister… - No. We should inform mom about what happened to dad. It's in the newspapers and TV, I'm sure they know about it now. Such news should come from their children. Ate, once and for all, let's just close that issue. I've closed it a long time ago. You're the one who's still digging through it, Grace. That woman left us a long time ago. I don't want to see her ever again. It will just create more tension if they come to the wake. Even our own brother? Brother? Lean. It's just the two of us who are siblings, Grace. - Take those outside. - Yes ma'am. Put more of that. Janet, what's this? Why did Grace do this?! Why did she put it there?! What will the people say? She thinks I don't know that she meets Sol. We are her family, Janet, not Sol. Up to now… I still can't forget… What that woman did. To me and dad. She's really evil. Don't say that. But I can't accept. That she doesn't respect me and your dad. I don't deserve this! Aunt. Grace did wrong. She did wrong to our family. [sobbing] Don't touch those biscuits with bare hands. Use napkins. Yes ma'am. Bring it outside, the people are hungry now. Do you know any possible enemies of Mr. Chan? I don't know, I don't know anything. How about employees that were fired? Or maybe humiliated? No one. No one? Or maybe he just didn't tell you? Nothing, really. But… I heard something from him… Before he died. What's that? He said that… - Sol! Sol! - Eat breakfast first. - Sol! - Yes ma'am. Sol! Sol, Lean just arrived. Lean. [gentle music] Lean. My son. [crying] He's gone, my child. [cries] Your father's gone. [sniffles] It's sad because I've finished it, mom. We didn't get to see each other. We need to go there. Will they accept us there mom? Why did you tell that to the police? I just told the truth. You told them that it's not hard to hate your dad. Is that what a good child does? I just answered their question. Don't humiliate our family. I'm not the cause of such humiliation. Ingrid. How about you, Erickson? You want to be like your sister? No, mom. Good. You, children that I accepted as my own… are more decent. Where was I? About dad's funeral. Exactly. The killer is not yet caught. Someone might cause a disturbance. The Department of Justice promised me that… They will give us tight security. I think we should avoid interviews. We're losing our privacy. The secrets of our family, they are now searching for them. We'll avoid the press but a certain someone… Is entertaining the media to show that she is Mrs. Chan. I'm the legal wife. Mr. Chan and I were married in China. My house is [speaks Chinese]. Melinda's house is [speaks Chinese] only. But the driver said that… He often goes home to Belinda. He's a liar. They always mistreat me. Belinda is a mistress, I'm the legal wife. So, who do you think has the motive… To kill Mr. Chan? [breathing deeply] No matter what, I'm the legal wife. I'm the one Mr. Chan loves. Mr. Chan loves me. Belinda didn't know about me. Maybe she's angry. He loves me. [light music] Do you really need to leave? I will not stay long in China. Don't worry. Dad. I want to go with you. You can't go. I will go far away. I will miss you. Me too. [gentle music] Take care of yourself. - [traditional Chinese music] - [children giggle] [scraping sound] [scraping sound] [cries] [upbeat traditional Chinese music] [traditional Chinese music continues] [firecrackers bursting] [gentle Chinese music] [firecrackers bursting] [camera clicks] [clapping] [gentle music] [factory machine noise] It's attractive to others, the 800 million Peso estate left by Antonio. Grace wants to inform Sol, what if she goes after the money? Sol's children are the problem. They might turn greedy or someone will encourage them. Then Antonio's sacrifices will be wasted. Erickson, stop it. [clunking sound] Merry Christmas to all of you. Merry Christmas too! First of all, I want all of you to know that my husband… Loved this company when he was still alive. Business is important. When employees are not happy in their jobs… Business is affected, business will fall. I am here now… To make sure… That what my husband had worked so hard for will not be lost. Why are you angry at me? I'm the one who's concerned with your business. Mr. Chan told me before. That I will be in charge of the business when he retires. I know that you're concerned about the company. Because you're good in business. But don't meddle too much. It's just, it's just… I only asked your employee to carry my things. The person who carried your things… Is my executive! I am accompanied now by Atty. Chiongbian. My cousin, Johnson. To continue the legacy of Mr. Chan. [clapping] I don't have any pictures with him, right? Uhmm, you're still very small when we separated. Is he angry at me? I don't think so. You? Do you feel bitterness towards him? [clunking sound] Doc, what's really my problem? No problem. Drink this so that the baby is secure in the womb. [paper rustles] You're pregnant, Congratulations. Thank you, doc. Tony will be happy when he gets back. [traffic noise] Rodrigo, can you bring the carriage near our house? It's hard because I'm pregnant. I hope your third child is a boy. Does Tony know that you're pregnant? He doesn't know yet. I don't know where to send a letter to. [tinkling sound] It seems like Tony's been gone for a long time now. I think he's enjoying China. I hope he comes home soon. He'll be back, don't worry. You're beautiful, that's why. [street noise] [horse hooves sound] Tony. Come quick! it's dad. - Dad. - Achi, Shobe. Whose child is that? He's Lean, he's our child. I was already pregnant when you went to China but I didn't know then. I really wanted to tell you at the time but I didn't know where to call you. [background street noise] Who is she? She's LuShui. My wife. [crickets chirping] [clanks] I'd like us to talk. Talk? Tony, who would be happy with what you did? You brought a woman here. My dad and mom forced me to marry LuShui. You can't refuse? It's forbidden to refuse in Chinese. Why am I the one at a disadvantage? We're here in the Philippines but I'm still the loser. [footsteps] [door closes] [sombre music] [door closes] Eat now. I know you're hurting because of the circumstances. I'm hurting too. You don't understand me. I don't understand you either. Let's try to get along. [clanks] [reflective piano music] Rose. Tell your mom that we can't postpone the funeral. She's still waiting for her relatives to arrive from China. Your dad doesn't know the relatives of your mom. Don't we have the right to decide? Your decision is not appropriate here. Talk to me, instead of her. LuShui. We can't postpone the funeral. Why not? I'm the wife too. When he was alive, I always said yes to you I've endured it for so long but now no more. You want the funeral at Christmas, why Christmas? Because I've consulted and that's the right time for Antonio's funeral. I don't get angry often but when I get angry, I'll create chaos. What do you want? You want to cut the body in half? Even though I'm not educated like you… I'll stoop down to your level. [footsteps] Don't agree with LuShui. Certainly not. And her daughter Rose is also stubborn. If you agree to postpone the funeral, it means she's in charge. That's really what she wants to happen. I can manage that woman. She's just like that because of other people. If you force what you want, there'll be a scandal in the land. Belinda talked to all of you? How about me? I always obey. I give everything. I left China. I gave all of my life to Antonio. I rarely asked. [cries] Then, all of you don't respect me. [crying] [door closes] Have you thought of a name for your baby? I also had a hard time when I gave birth to Janet. Please give me a discount. - I already gave you a big discount. - LuShui. That's Belinda Que. It seems that she's always here. She has many orders for Tony. Yes, no problem. [factory noise] Thank you. Bye. [speaks Chinese] [waiter] Here, ma'am. Believe me, the products are cheap there. You're sure? [laughs] [background chatter] [water gushing] You guys eat now. [background chatter] [Sorrowful music] I can't take this anymore. [footsteps] [rain patters] Walk fast, go there. Grace, don't let yourself get wet, hold on to me. Janet, walk fast. Walk fast. [punches] [blast] Why did she leave? Why did she take the children? [loud thud] [thudding sounds] I'm sorry Rodrigo, We have nowhere to go. Don't worry Sol, as long as you need, you can stay here. Please make do with this small house. - Sol, it's good that you came here. - Oh, we even disturbed your sister. Oh dear, it's okay. Badong's friends are my friends too. Come inside, tell me if you need anything. - Janet come here. Mom, I want to go home. Janet, we've talked about this, come now. - Mom, I don't wanna be here, I wanna go home to dad. Janet, come back here. - I wanna go home! - Janet! [thunderstorm] [rain patters] I want dad, I don't want all of you. Janet? [crashes] [raining hard] [screams] Janet! [screaming] Janet! [background chatter] [light music] [background chatter] [music continues] [cries] Dad. Dad. Are you Sol? Is he Lean? Why? Why did you bring him? It's a big insult to all of us. Why? I'm also his child! Who told you that? Lean, Lean. Go ahead outside, I'll be there shortly. Go ahead. Go ahead. If there are people who deserve to be here… It's us! Not you! [footsteps] Sorry mom, I wasn't able to welcome you earlier. Uhmm sir, don't leave because we'll be leaving shortly. [driver] Yes ma'am. [car door closes] - Miss, please prepare snacks for mom and Lean. Yes ma'am. Mom, why were you so quiet earlier? Do you have something to tell us? [Sol] It's hard to explain when you're angry. Why do you let Johnson be rude to you? I just don't want to stoop down to his level. - He made you look like a fool earlier. - Ah! I just don't want to start a fight. Mom, I'm just confused. You told me before that I was just 2 yrs. old when you and dad separated. I remember that he pushed me when I was with Grace. He pushed you because you were blocking his way. He wanted to take you, I didn't want to give you to him. What's the real reason why you and dad separated? What's this Lean? How many times will I tell you all that has happened? It seems that it's not complete. You separated because of Belinda. Oh. You already know the answer. Why do you still ask questions? Mom. Why didn't you fight for your rights? You're the legal wife. Because… It doesn't deserve to be fought for. A relationship that's long been destroyed. It's like your story doesn't add up. During high school, I wanted dad to come but you said to not bother. At my graduation, I wanted to invite him but you didn't want to. Because he didn't want to see you. Why is it that he didn't want to see me? He hates me. He hates you but does not want to see me? That's what he said. Mom come on, I know that the eldest son is important to Chinese people. I'm the eldest son. Why didn't he take me? Because… I don't want to give you to him. [gentile piano music] [sobbing] Forgive me. [gentle, sad music continues] [angrily] Get out of here. Get out now! No! Leave the two kids. Leave! Tony, have pity. Don't take our kids. These two are my children. That… - Is not my kid, not my kid! - Don’t! Don't! - He's your son… - Don't hurt him. - You're a bad mother. - Tony, it's not my fault. Leave now! I might hurt the kid. Don't! - I'll hurt him. - Don't! Go now! Don't! Mama. Don't ever come back! [sniffles] Because you didn't get to tell… You didn't get to tell me everything. Because… [cries] Because… I didn't want you to grow up hating your father. Now, I feel like we are… The illegitimate family. [sniffles] I don't regret it. Separating from your father. Maybe… Maybe dad's suspicions were right. [slaps] [sobbing] You know Tony. Lean is finishing college soon. He wants to pursue a Master's degree in Asian studies. Tony, he's a cum laude. At his graduation, he wants you to hang his medal on him. So that you'll be proud of your son. I don't want to talk to him. Tell Lean the truth. That I don't accept him. [slow reflective music] [reflective music continues] [door opens] Lean. 2 days till Christmas. We rarely get together. Do we to have fight? Sorry, mom. Yna, Yna. Yna wait. Why does your family see me as a bad person? Tell me, do they know anything about us? Nobody knows. So go back there. You're afraid that they're talking about us? It's hard to contradict them, they're close-minded people. They say that it's also hard to have a Chinese boyfriend. Yna, I'm doing something about it. Why? Am I complaining? My friends are the ones saying that. Not me. - Ingrid! where's Ingrid? - She's over there. Ingrid! [footsteps] Let's go now. What do you want to happen?! Don't! This is my house! You want to live here? Go home! I don't want to! Let her be! I'll drag you from here. I'm pregnant! And dad knows that I'm pregnant. [slaps] [scuffling] [dramatic traditional music] [music continues] I thought you're weren't going to come. Boss, uhmm… The investigation really shows that… What happened to Antonio Chan is just a random robbery. Should we show it like that? But sir, all the evidence points to that. Maybe someone ordered the hit. Ordered? It's possible, right? [music continues] [indistinct speech] Grace. You can help Sol and Lean in another way. Why would you give her your share of the company? It's my personal decision. You just want to create tension in the family. Mom and Lean are also my family. Even dad didn't accept them. That is dad's mistake that I'm trying to correct. Maybe you should not give it all, Grace. Think about it. It will create disorder. Right attorney? It will affect the flow of the business. It's okay with me. I don't know about Janet. It's not okay. Why reward someone who has never been part of this? Where were they when we were sacrificing to make this business work? It's not mom's and Lean's fault because they were not here then. He cheated our father. Enough already. That's not true, dad was wrong about that. I would not have been like this, if it weren't for her. Dad's accusations were wrong. Grace, don't you dare say that your father is a liar. Or else, I'll be your enemy. Mom left dad because of you. [door closes] There's no point in our relationship, Erickson. Why do you say that? We've been together for 3 years. You still haven't introduced me to your mom. Or anyone in your family. I'm just waiting for the right timing. There's no future in our relationship. We're different. I'm serious about us, Yna. Let's break up. No, I don't want that. If you want, if you want, let's elope. Are you joking? I'm serious. When? Tomorrow, the day after tomorrow. Here same time. [dramatic music] [dramatic music continues] [music softens] [sobbing] [music swells] [sobbing] [music crescendos] [sorrowful music] [speaks Chinese] Go ahead son, it's your right. [music builds] [epic music continues] [music fades] Grace is ungrateful. She let those two stay in her house. Then she will give her share of the company to Sol? Why? Didn't Antonio leave a last will and testament? Nothing! I told him before to arrange that and now Sol will enter the picture. So, what happens now? To the things you worked for? How about mine? Erickson! You can't go out! Not after humiliating me at the funeral! You, you're Janet's husband. Won't you use that position to stop Grace? Why are you standing there like a fool? Janet can't handle Grace. Go back to your room. [children chatter] Belinda! Come out here! Belinda! Belinda! Why did you lock my house?! You're evil! Belinda! Hey! You're really bad! Belinda! Why is she acting that way? I ordered her house to be locked up. Come out here! Belinda! Erickson, stop it. [breathes deeply] [thuds] [crickets chirping] You'll not wait for mom? She doesn't want to see me. Where do you live now? [car starts] It's better that you guys don't know. I want to you ask you something You know my number, you can call me. When will we meet again? Maybe when we have our own families. [car door thuds] [thuds] Why do you need to go to a hotel? I'm offering my house so that you'll stay here. This is just temporary. Because my Makati condo still has a tenant. They can't vacate immediately. [cries] It's because of you. You left. And of course… You left all your problems to me. I can't take it anymore. He has two wives already. He wanted to make it three. What? Will I wait till it becomes eight? [laughing] But you know, when you left… Of course, I took care of your kids. Thank you. But when Belinda came [speaks Chinese]. Oh dear, you know… She took Grace and Janet. Of course it hurt me, you know. It hurts the most, for me. My children grew up without me. Dad died and now they're mistreating us. Rose, get it out of your head. Don't add more problems to our family. [breathes deeply] You think dad will be happy that we're having problems if he was alive now? He will be hurt. Our dad never lacked for anything as a father. You know. In each of our birthdays… Even though there have been many… He still comes. He never forgets to come. Dad's like that. Every time you sleep at night, you think he forgets you? No. He's looking and making sure… You're having a good sleep. He'll kiss you before he leaves. [sighs] If they can say anything about dad as husband… They can say all the criticisms. But as a father… No. Because he loves us. He loves us very much. You're the one who shot Antonio Chan, right? No sir. [grunts] Why did you rob and kill him? Sir, it was just an impulse. Sir, just an impulse. Someone ordered you to do it, right? No one sir. There's someone. - No one sir. - Someone ordered you to do it. There's someone, right? Answer! [water splashes] [coughs] Now. Someone ordered you. Right? Sir don't, don't sir. Sir, have pity on me, I have a family. Sir please. Sorry because I unload all my problems to you. There's no one I can talk to. Do you really love your Filipina girlfriend? Yes. Why don't you tell your mom? Mama's too much. Always tells me what to do. I'm scared to go against her. Be strong, son. [door opens] [glass shatters] [glass shatters] Ma'am, ma'am! Rose! [background chatter] Ate Janet. Grace, what's that soup… Lydia, get me out of here. Lydia don't! Ma'am. - Lydia, get me out of here! - Leave us now. Ate, this will just be a few minutes. Talk to each other, once and for all. Leave now. I just wanted to see you. And explain. About what happened between your father and I. Ate, listen to mom, even for a few minutes. I don't want to talk to either of you. Leave now. Lydia, let's go now! Lydia! [sobs] [crying] I love you, Janet. You're always in my heart. [gentle music] Leave now. Mom. - Mom. - Ate Janet's heart is stone-cold. It's enough that I hugged her. She'll soften soon. I told her about the story you told me about you and dad. Belinda is poisoning her mind these days. [car engine sound] Good afternoon, ma'am. Can you come with us? We have a warrant for the murder of Antonio Chan. Why me? Wait sir, do you have proof? That's highly irregular, you should have issued a subpoena. The subpoena was been delivered to her house long before this. She's staying with me temporarily and you know it! I think it's better to go to the headquarters to talk it over. - Ma'am… - My mom is not a criminal. It's just standard operating procedure, ma'am. Ma'am? That's not needed. I will go with you. You can follow us Mom, mom, we'll follow you, I'll just call the lawyer. We'll follow, no matter what. There. Walk fast. You know that mom had nothing to do with what happened. Why do you blame her? Did someone pressure you? Your penalty will not lessen if you implicate other people. Please, I have a request. Take back everything you said. Don't involve innocent people. It's really her. [sinister music] I wonder why they involved me, of all people. I will testify for you. I will testify that you're a good person. Thank you. Do you have a lawyer? I have, Grace talked to her. Turn right, ma'am. It's not only Sol that should be behind bars. That mother and daughter should be jailed too! Your daughter wrecked the things in my house! It's just things, if it was me, I'd wreck your face! You even went to the funeral. I should have done that to you a long time ago! Ma'am, ma'am stop it, enough ma'am. You guys are evil! I hope you rot in jail, Sol! Animal! You're an animal! - Animal! let go of me! - Ma'am. Animals! [cries] [phone rings] Hello. Who's this? Pio Andres? You know, the night your dad was killed… he called me from his cell phone That's why I'm sure my number is in his cell phone. I just learned that right now. I wonder why they didn't invite me for questioning. It did not even show up in their reports. Can you prove that I really had nothing to do with what happened? Tony called me because he wanted me to do something. Two weeks before our last meeting… He discovered something. [speaking Chinese] If your back still hurts, come back here. Don't forget your Machang. I think your son will be like you. Not Erickson. The first, your son with Sol. That's Sol now. That's a blow-up picture of her voter's I.D. She doesn't have a husband. She never remarried. She still carries your surname. Lean is my child. Tony. The record of his blood type… Is the same as yours. I also got… Hair samples from his barber. I had the DNA test done in America. It matched. And he looks exactly like you. Where is Sol now? [reflective music] Dad loves you, mom. The first time he made me look for you… He gave me this letter. He told me to give it to you, if I found you. Whatever's in that letter, recent events have overtaken it. Because last time, he intended… to meet the two of you. [background chatter] [knocks] Ma'am, do you know him? Erickson. Leave now. Give me a chance to explain. There's no chance for us. We'll just repeat what happened to your father. Your family will always criticize me because of my different race. I don't care about them now! [whimpers] It's because I'm scared. Your mom called me. She told me… That she doesn't like me. She called you? [door closes] [crickets chirping] [thuds] This is just between us. I will not involve you, just tell the truth. Is my intuition right, that my mom was framed? We're clean, ma'am. Clean. You're all clean in doing it, is that it? My life is at stake here, ma'am. I know. That's why I brought an assurance for your future. [knocks] [electric window whirrs] [background chatter] [over radio] All units, 10-12. The subject is still negative. [swings] Sir, good evening. Good evening, the money's over there. [background noise] Do we need to count it? Huh? No need, sir. You said two, so it's two. Thank you, just make sure that your work is clean. So that Sol will never be free. It's clean, sir, don't worry. So sir, we'll go now. Alright. Sorry sir, you're under arrest. How did this happen? We're supposed to split the money. [dramatic music] [gunshot fired] Telephone call for you, ma'am. Hello. [background tv noise] Get me out of here. Take me there. There! [grunts] Leave! Leave now! Leave now! [cries] [sad piano music] [sobbing] I should have not bailed you out. What kind of madness did you do? I didn't ask you to do anything. You told me to do something so that Sol can't enter the picture. You bastard! I didn’t' tell you to do something illegal! So now I'm the bad one? Don't involve me, stupid! Grace. Sol. I'm very happy, thank you. They learned that I'm innocent. [camera clicks] The lawyer said that it's easy to get rid of the case. And I'm really not at fault. And I was thinking that… It's a big problem if Sol enters the company. [bed squeaks] You don't love that person, anyway. Plus. It’s like my revenge for the deception she did to your father. [spits] Condolences, for what happened to Mr. Chan. You will receive 200 million pesos from First Life. [gentle music] This is for you and your siblings. I had nothing to do with what Johnson did. But they think you know something. But the truth is I know nothing. [speaks Chinese] Believe me. Why me? I'm actually the one who took care of his children. But you have to do something about it. I am willing to meet and be friends with Sol and LuShui. No problem with me. [speaks Chinese] Inday, call Grace. [reflective music] My beloved son. Sometimes I imagine that we're together. If we'll be given a chance to meet. Maybe that's the time we'll feel the joy… Believe me… not even for a second… did I stop loving your mother. [sniffles] [light music] [dramatic music] [glass shatters] Happy New Year! Happy New Year! Erickson, Erickson! Erickson! Don't be rude! What now?! - Happy New Year! - Happy New Year! Erickson! Erickson! Get out of there! You're stubborn! I told you to open this, open this! Erickson! I told you to open it! [dramatic music continues] No! Erickson! [gunshot fired] [horn beeping] [wails] [sobbing] [choral music] [sobbing continues] [light music] [light music continues] Forgive me for every wrong I've done. [sobs] [birds chirping] Mom. Janet.
