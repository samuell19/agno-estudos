[MUSIC PLAYING] [FILM ROLLING] [PANTING] Yeah. Hey. No girls in the locker room. Have you see my pompoms? No. Would you like to? It's a big game today. We're out of sync. MAN: I'm trying to get pumped up. WOMAN: That's what I'm here for. Come on, guys. Come on. We're out of sync. MAN: Oh. We are out of sync. [PANTING] MAN: Yeah. Hey. No girls in the locker room. Have you seen my pompoms? No. Would you like to? MAN: No. It's a big game today. I'm trying to get pumped up. That's what I'm here for. I'd do anything to win big game. Oh. Hey. Oh. You're looking for someone? Jack Hammer? Who the hell wants to know? [GRUNTS] Oh. She's my daughter, you son of a bitch. What are you doing? [GRUNTS] Oh, god. WOMAN 1: Security, success, happiness. Look, it all comes down to love, right? So sweetie, tell me. How's it going? Tepid. WOMAN 2: Oh, it's going OK. But sometimes I feel out of control. WOMAN 1: You really can overdo it. Sometimes a little chaos can be good for you. I think this woman is a genius. WOMAN 2: How do I know I'm making the right choice? Easy. If you make it a trend. WOMAN 1: You can't just sit around waiting for Mr. Perfect. How about Mr. OK for the time being? WOMAN 1: Listen, sweetie. Loneliness can make us do some really stupid things. You've got to take a good look at yourself and say, what am I really looking for? My briefcase. WOMAN 1: It's there. You'll find it. And you deserve it. [ENGINE RUNNING] [MUSIC PLAYING] MAN 1: Is there anybody else here in my scene? Something talking maybe. MAN 2: Yeah, I'm the only who works here. No one else arrived. MAN 1: But you were less than 10 feet away when this one-- Do you want some coffee? MAN 1: Now, huh. I mean, the shape, was this guy big, tall, heavy? MAN 2: I'm telling you, I didn't see the dude. MAN 1: Well, did you hear anything? Did anybody say-- - Hi. I'm looking for Mr. Hammer. So? I understand he makes movies here. Sometimes. Do you expect him? He's in and out. Do you have a phone? Down the hall. Look, man. It's just a job for me. I just project the stuff. I don't actually watch it. See, it's really not my style. I'm more of a family man-type, you know. Well, let's see. You were 20 feet away when the shit went down. You didn't see anything huh? T.K.: Excuse me. The phone. OK. I guess it's a craft beer. Then he fixed himself up and split. Now, where did he go? Who? What? T.K.: Jack Hammer? Do I know you? Do you mind? This is private. Yeah. Well, the phone's public. You work for Hammer? I have an appointment with him. Audition? He's a witness in the case I'm representing. [CHUCKLES] You represent these scumbags? I represent the man who owns the building. Jack Hammer's gone? Yoo-hoo. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, he was all bloody and stuff. And the guy just ran out of here, you know. I didn't want no doctor and enough, you know. I just-- [RINGING] RUSSELL: Hello. Hello. Yeah, Russell. It's me. RUSSELL: It's about time. Shut up. RUSSELL: Now, you got a lot of messages. Forget the messages. We have a problem with the Seldes case. RUSSELL: The problem was taking the case in the first place. By the way, three of the calls were him. T.K.: Russell, Russell. I've got no time for this. Our key witness has disappeared. RUSSELL: Great. What do we do now? T.K.: Yeah. Well, what about the police? Check with them. RUSSELL: Anybody else? - And the hospitals. He had his face smashed, for God's sake. Look, I got to go. I'm having lunch with a client. RUSSELL: Uh-huh. Restaurant? Never mind which restaurant. I'll call you later. Bye. Hi. Counselor. What you got? Punch. Table for two with a view. This hand-roll is fantastic. Where did you find this place? Here, take another one. Steven, don't worry. He's not our only witness. We'll find others who'll testify. [LAUGHS] What I want to know is how you could rent a property to anybody calling himself Jack Hammer. That's what I want to know. I have buildings all over town. I don't know what goes on in half of them. He was casting minors. I got a teenage daughter, for Christ's sake. If this thing drags on much longer-- No, the hearing is next week. We'll win. You'll see. Well, I may pick a lousy tenant. But boy, when it comes to lawyer, huh, the best. Few rules in my life. Never get involved with a client. Never get involved with a married man. Uh-uh. Married in name only, pie face. Never get involved with anyone who calls me pie face. [LAUGHS] How much time do you have? Nope, this is a business lunch. You're going to bill me for this? Yep. Anyway, I have to track down a new witness, don't I? Hmm. How about tonight? I don't know when I'll be home. I'll wait. I can let myself in, you see. Hmm? Come here. WOMAN: Liability here. You can't show fraud by the officers when your-- Hi, Nina. Hello. This is Bodeck here. Is that her? Mm-hmm. WOMAN: You don't want her to get it all, do you? Well, they're going to get it anyway, aren't they? Well, we don't quite see it that way. Your last offer is no longer on the table. Mrs. Bodeck. Yes. I'm Steven Seldes' lawyer. I really don't think you should be here. Neither do I. You're a woman. Time's changed. They keep saying some things don't change, having children. The pain that caused, that doesn't change. I know. You have children? No. Then how can you say that? What is it, the money? Is that what you're trying to get him off? My client is innocent. The state brought charges simply because he owns the warehouse where the film was-- God, you're lying. I'm not. Ask him. I have. Mrs. Bodeck, using minors and material like that is a crime. And it should be punished. It will be. I went there to see it. I sat there. It made me sick. It made me-- somehow, some way, we will get over this. God will see to it. I know He will. But if my husband does something, something that can't be forgiven, if my husband kill someone, I brought these photographs. He doesn't like to have his picture taken. He's gone crazy, just plain crazy. And I can't talk to him anymore. That Mr. Seldes, you tell him to protect himself. You tell him to be careful. And if he has any feelings about what he's done, any feelings at all, you-- NINA: Thank you for waiting. May I take that message now? Yes. For tomorrow's deposition. Good morning. Rutherford, Randall, Braddock and Dunn. I'm sorry, Mr. Taylor. He's in court this morning. Would you like to leave a message? T.K.: This is a deposition of Harold Weinstein, a.k.a. Bull Dozer. Present is my client. Steven Seldes is a defendant in case number A036258, People versus Seldes, et al. How did you find out about Weinstein? Bull. Call me Bull. Bull Dozer. Mr. Dozer, slash, Weinstein has agreed to have his deposition taken. And he's here on his own volition without counsel. That's right. Mr. Dozer, you appeared in a film released last year called "Nudes On The Moon." Or starring in it. T.K.: Released through Blue Screen Productions. Yeah. Could you tell me where the movie was shot? Sure. In a warehouse on Third Street downtown. T.K.: The address? Oh, I do not-- god, I've been going there so long, I forget. It's brown. Could it be 849 East Third? Next to Momma's takeout Mexican deli? The address is 849 East Third Street. I had lunch there. Try the chorizo. Regarding other cast members, did you work with an actress named Cindy? Sure. She's in the scene where I turned in the dildo. Cindy Bodeck. I guess so. She's mostly with the Dykes in the beginning. Did you see the picture? No. It's a fantasy. Or special effects. And Cindy Bodeck was in that scene? With some others. T.K.: Is that a yes? Yeah. Is she really only 14? Her old man practically killed Jack. Yikes. Um, well, at any time during filming or before or after filming, during editing, did you ever see the man on my left? No. Did you ever hear the name Steven Seldes connected to Blue Screen Productions? No. T.K.: You don't recognize his face? I've never seen him. WOMAN: Thelma? Thelma Knudsen? Thelma Knudsen Katwuller? T.K. Say it's you. Say it. - Ellie? Yeah. [GIGGLES] God. Ah, hang on. I can't believe. What in the world? Oh, it sure is small, isn't it? Well-- Yeah. - We should sit down. - Yes. Over there? Yeah. Would you-- I mean, would you believe it? No, I don't believe this. This is really funny. I mean, I have never in this part of town. Well, hardly ever, just when I hit the sales at Bullocks. Their linen department is unbeatable. It is unbeatable. And I thought, well, I'll just have lunch here for a change. You know, just a bite. Then home to Woodland Hills. It's incredible. I've been hearing a lot about you. Oh, really? Is your office in the neighborhood? - Yeah. - I bet it is. Isn't it? Yeah. - How long has it been? - Oh. Ages. Not since I left school and got married. - Someone from Philly, right? - Uh-huh. I knew it. [LAUGHS] Oh, you look great. You look great. No. But I mean, really, you do. Really? I don't believe what they charge for this salad. [LAUGHS] You haven't changed a bit. Oh, yes, I have. You can't raise a child and keep a marriage glued together for 20 years without changing. 20 years? 20 years, yes. Guess it's time for pictures, huh. You know, come to dinner tomorrow night. Oh, I can't. I have a date. - You're not married? - Nope. Prospects? No, not really. Well, I'm not surprised. [GIGGLES] No. I mean, at Smith, you hardly had time for boys. Oh. Yeah. Well-- - Oh, well, never mind. Here. This is Janna. - Uh-huh. Beautiful. Thank you. And here's Steven. Isn't it a riot? Excuse me. Oh. What is it, your contacts? I don't know. My lash, maybe. All of the sudden there was this horrific pain. OK, let me see. Tilt your head back toward the light. You shouted like a scalded cat. Ain't it a hoot about Steven? What a coincidence. Isn't it? There's a little bitty speck right there in the corner. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Use lots of water. When he finally got around to mentioning who is representing him-- oh, when was it? Saturday. Yeah, Saturday. In this awful mess. I think I got it. Good. You could have knocked me over with a feather. Oh, what the heck? Long as we're here. You never answered me. About what? ELLIE: Steven. Oh, yeah. A hoot. ELLIE: Isn't he? Yeah. ELLIE: After all this time. And you being my best friend, even after all this time, you've got to come to dinner. Bring your date. You can see the house and get to know Steven better. Meet Janna. She's the light of our lives. I'm not taking no for an answer. Huh. Ugh. Work. Old lady. The green, too masculine. The black, too guilty. The orange, too flashy. The brown, why did you ever buy the brown? The yellow, too yellow. The print, too young. The red-- too young? The prints, too young. Just sign the confession and skip dinner. [DOORBELL RINGING] Welcome to Casa Serene. Oh, Eleanor. Where is he? Your date, where is he? Oh, he couldn't make it. Hello. Hi. Can I get you another one? Yes, please. Thanks. The room is stunning. It's a-- it's a stunning room. Thank you. You must keep it hermetically sealed. What? Spotless. It's just absolutely spotless. It's amazing. ELLIE: Have you tried my guacamole? T.K.: No, it looks great. You look fabulous. Doesn't she look great? Yeah, she does. Thanks. Hmm. Come on, honey. This is Janna. Hello. Hi. Janna is going to Smith like us. T.K.: Oh, is she? Uh-huh. You found us OK? Uh, there's a lake. There's a golf course too. [LAUGHS] I didn't know there was a lake. There's one. It's new. STEVEN: Everything is very well thought out. I can see that. Smith, huh? So what are you majoring in? She's going to be an architect. T.K.: Oh, are you? She'll design where daddy will build them. Seldes and Seldes. We'll set the world on fire. Come, pie face. I don't believe I did that. Let me get something. Don't bother. You're not going to do anything? Let's go into dinner. More? Oh, no. Thanks. It's delicious. It was too delicious. Your daddy's lawyer? Yeah. What are you doing here? What? Is everything all right? Janna, I think you've been-- Well, is it? I don't think we have to worry. - Then why are you here? - She's my friend. I told you she'd be coming back-- I know what you told me. I just think that we should get someone a little bit more professional. That's all. - That's enough. - I don't like the way-- I said that's enough. I'll help you clear. ELLIE: Do you remember Mr. Crowder? English list. First thing Monday morning. The one covered in chalk dust and dandruff and farted all the time? [GIGGLES] God. That was terrible. I had to skip breakfast. You know, I hardly ever remember back then. Was it fun? It was fun, wasn't it? Not so much. But you maybe, you were brighter. I don't know about bright. Did you ever get married? To John? Yes. Yes, I did, as a matter of fact. He flirted all the time. [LAUGHTER] They usually do eventually. Wait. Which do you think is worse? When they just slip it by or they just flat out do it? Oh, gee. I don't know. Slipping it by always strikes me as slightly effeminate. Steven just-- mm. Steven what? Here. Put this in the dishwasher. [LAUGHS] Oh. Like we are roommates again, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah, it's nice. It was fine. I really got to be going. Did you ever have any children? No. Not really. I had, um, an abortion. We were young, I guess. I'm kidding. Not so young. And I had to make a decision. John was OK in the long run. It's been a long run. I love you. Yeah. Oops. You better put your top up. It's cold. I don't have a top. What happened? I had lunch on Third Street. Well, I'll get one of Ellie's sweaters. No, thanks. You'll freeze. [SIGHS] [ENGINE STARTING] STEVEN: Here. I'll pick it up later. Look, I know how you feel. I'm sorry. We'll talk about it tomorrow. No, we won't. STEVEN: I'll call you. Don't. STEVEN: You are so silly. Stupid. I think the word is stupid. Come on. World is full of creeps. [SIGHS] You son of a bitch. Why is it always the same? The same god damn thing always. Why don't I learn? [SIGHS] Have I ever really been in love? Oh, yeah, him. What's his name? Why can't I remember names anymore? No more. Never ever. The end, finished. Lyle. Jesus, what's wrong with me? His name was Lyle. God, I was crazy about him. Why do I do it? What, am I talking to myself? one of the reasons I never looked you up, Ellie, is you always had this knack for making me feel guilty. She's so sweet. [LAUGHS] Used to drive me crazy. Nobody could be that sweet. I'd be dead of hypoglycemia. Stop it. God, how did I get myself into this? [SIGHS] [SCRUBBING] STEVEN: Why don't we just-- You're dodging. STEVEN: Listen, pie face. I'm really sorry. - My key. I want my key. STEVEN: Well, what about my case? You want me to continue representing you, that we can discuss. Yeah. Hang on a minute. Uh, no. Jimmy's handling that. I'm back. STEVEN: Look, I'm just going to come over to your place. No, not my place. Your office. STEVEN: When? Whenever, as long as it's today. This afternoon? STEVEN: No, I can't do it this afternoon. All right. After work, tonight. [MUSIC PLAYING] Steven? [PHONE RINGING] RUSSELL: Shalom. Russell. Haven't you gone home yet? RUSSELL: No. I'm swamped. Look, will you do me a favor? I'm running late for my dinner with Cavinoff. I didn't bring his number. RUSSELL: Now, where is it? Uh, it's on my Rolodex. Do you mind? RUSSELL: Now, hold on. Cavinoff. 5554837. 4837. 5554837. RUSSELL: All right. Have a good time. Yeah. Thanks. STEVEN: Sorry I'm late. We won't have much time. Expecting someone? Yes. T.K.: To audition? For what? Blue Screen Productions. What's the problem? Where are you going? Liar! Hey, what are doing? Liar! You pervert! What is wrong with you? What's wrong? What's wrong? STEVEN: Hey. Will you-- goddammit. Would you calm down, for Christ's sake? T.K.: You're going to jail. Uh! [GRUNTS] Ah! [SCREAMS] You stupid-- [PANTING] [GROANS] [COUGHS] Shit. [GRUNTS] [SOBS] My keys. Oh, shit! [DIALS] [RINGING] WOMAN: You have reached the office of Steven Seldes. The machine does not take messages. Please call back, if you remember, during office hours. Oh, god. OK, now. Steven, can you hear me? Pick it up. Oh, god. Steven, are you all right? God, what did I do? Steven? Steven! [PANTING] [SCREAMS] I've got a few questions. Look, I already-- they took my statement, OK? Yeah, I know. You came here on business, right? He's-- he was my client. And we were going to trial. - Mm-hmm. What business? What? What business? Uh, the-- the usual, the loose ends that we were-- uh, he was worried. About what? That's why I came to find out. Well, he was right to be worried. And? I found him. Here. Thanks. I found him. And I called you. And you came. You used the phone on his desk? I've been-- um, you know, I've been through all this. I can't-- You saw the office. You looked in the men's room. Why did you do that? I don't know. The blood, I-- um, I thought he might be hurt. How was he hurt? MAN: Well, we have to wait for the coroner's report. But you did see the blood, though, right? In the hallway? And then you followed it to the men's room. Yeah, yeah. No. No, it was dark. Dim. I heard running water. How's your head? It's fine. I just, um-- I slipped. It was, um-- I panicked. Ice cubes. Well, you can go. Are you OK to drive? Yeah. I'm fine. You're going to be around, right? Hey. For the road. [MUSIC PLAYING] NINA: Good morning. Rutherford, Randall, Braddock and Dunn. One moment please. I'm sorry, Mr. Hampton. There's no answer. One moment. Hi, Nina. - Rutherford wants you. - Shit. Cops were here earlier. Lay peaceful. Go ahead, Mr. Hampton. [PHONE RINGING] Yeah, Nina. Mrs. Seldes is on the line. She says it's important. Thanks. T.K.: Beutel. Were you the arresting officer? Guilty. Did you get any sleep, counselor? I want to see my client. Seldes? Yes. Does she know the charges? Well, they are pretty easy to figure out. T.K.: Like? Dead husband. And how did he die? Unwillingly. Do we have an attitude problem here? Not that I know of. Then what's going on? Look, here's a copy of the report. It's all preliminary, pretty general stuff. Stab wounds, broken nose. Possibly choked on his own blood. And possibly not. The weapon? Oh, there will be a weapon. I promise. You didn't find it? Well, they generally don't leave them laying around, people who do stuff like this. Send Seldes into 308, please. All right. Thanks. Uh, Russell Paige. Yeah? How many calls did you make last night? What? Russell Paige, an assistant in your office, received a call. Yeah, sure. About a dinner appointment? T.K.: Sure. Where did you make that call? From my car. [CHUCKLES] Right. Busy woman. Very. Did they say why they arrested you? They just came. I had to take Janna next door. They weren't even up yet. We just stood around the front yard, half naked. T.K.: What did they say? That I killed Steven. T.K.: All right, look. Last night when it happened, where were you? Driving. T.K.: Just driving alone? Is that a crime? No. Of course not. When you were driving, did you stop anywhere for gas, cigarettes? I didn't stop anywhere. T.K.: All right. When you got home, did you make any phone calls? Did you speak to anyone? Someone could've called. I fell asleep. You don't suppose I could get a cigarette somewhere, do you? I'll arrange bail. You'll represent me, then. No, I can't. My being a material witness makes that difficult, to say the least. I'll find someone. If it's a question of money, I-- Money is not the point. Money is always the point. With you, it is. Where was Janna during all this? Out. Well, when she came home, did she wake you? The sun-- the sun woke me. How do you suppose the sweater got there? That's why they came? They found my sweater. [SCRIBBLING] Fax this, will you? Can it be done in the morning? I want to file it first thing in the morning. Do you really think they're going to give her bail? Do it, Russell. Just do it. Hey. Don't take your guilt out on me. What guilt? You were sleeping with her husband. So what? It's my fault. I'm responsible. For what? You didn't kill the guy. I'm responsible for everything else. Did you tell the police about the affair? Now, you're material witness, they could haul you down there. Arrest me, disbar me. I know. I thought of me, that's all. I just-- I was scared. I'm confused. All I could think of was how I'd, uh-- how I'd ruined myself. And they arrested Ellie. What are you going to do? Call the police. Get it over with. RUSSELL: Now, that's a terrific idea if you're into self-destruction. Then you're no good to Mrs. Seldes or yourself. WOMAN: Boy, it was a mess. We had a hell of a time getting an accurate count. What? WOMAN: The wounds. Same angle, same area. We finally came up with 18. It was like he just sat there when it happened. [TYPEWRITER CLICKS] [CRYING] [PHONE RINGING] Hello? DOCTOR: Decrease his peripheral IV to 75 CC per hour. Sorry. We were just leaving. [SIGHS] Did you guys forget something? I told you everything. Do you remember me? Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure. You're the lawyer. I thought you were the cops. Can you tell me if this is the man who hurt you? Who is he? That motherfucking son of a bitch tried to kill me. It was Sherman Bodeck. BULL DOZER: Like the kid's father? That's just he had said. Said. Then he was-- he must have been the one who was calling me. When? I didn't pay any attention. Because he was just breathing and then nothing. And I get these all the time. And he changes the number that he got. How? How did they get it? At work. How the fuck am I supposed to work when nobody he can reach me? Oh, my god. [SOBS] Look, can you go-- can you-- can you leave me alone? Well, it's harder when somebody see me like this. [COUGHS] Sure. They put in a prostheses, they call it. I got to be able to sue for that, don't I? Yeah. I'm sure you can. [SIGHS] T.K.: Hi. Are you Cindy? Is your mom home? [BARKING] Mrs. Bodeck? MRS. BODECK: [COUGHING] Mrs. Bodeck. Leave me alone. Are you all right? Can I help? I'm T.K.-- I know who you are. He'll kill us both if he comes back. Why would he kill us? Because he knows I talk to you. He knows you'll come after him. He's gone off again. I don't know how soon he's coming back. Did he kill Steven? Go away. Will you help me? I'll try. Talk to Jack for me. Jack Hammer. I want to say I'm sorry. It wasn't my fault my father found out. And ask him if maybe I can come back. They were real nice to me. I'm really sorry about Steven. You knew Steven? I've never been treated so good before. I'm going crazy right now. In court all day, campaigning after night. There's a 4 o'clock deadline or the pollsters won't make the fundraiser. How's the Seldes case coming? Uh, it's getting there. Am I going to have anything to prosecute? I wouldn't bet on it. Here, check these out. Which do you think? BEUTEL: Well, you look younger when you smile. Yeah, I know. But maybe I can get a delay. What, until after the election? The DA has handed me a real turn, you know. Well, he's afraid you're going to beat McGuire. So you got anything on Seldes? Mm, she's clean. And she's Southern. Christ. It's going to look like I'm still marching on Thelma. T.K.: Beutel. Beutel. I have been calling your office. Oh, hi, Bill. Which one? For posters? You look younger when you smile. Did they tell you? What? That I called. I shouldn't be listening to this. Bodeck's disappeared. So? So put out an APB. Well, you need, for God's sake. He's already beating his wife and another-- He didn't strike me as the kind of guy who's going to give somebody time out before he finishes the job. I'm sure all this makes perfect sense to you. Ice cubes. Seldes' nose was busted. He used them to stop the bleeding. Now, Bodeck was going to allow him to do that? Or there were two people. Maybe. Maybe not. Look, whatever happened, you've got the wrong person. Well, prove it. That's your job description. You mean, you're not going to do anything? Yeah. I'm going lunch. [PHONE RINGING] Hello? Mr. Bodeck? Is that you? Who is this? [ELEVATOR DINGS] You're looking great. WOMAN: Mr. Monroe, you claim to have the best conviction rate in the DA's office. - It's not a claim. It's a fact. I don't give them taxpayers' money if I'm not going to get a conviction. Two double Martinis, rocks, no olives. Scotch and water. Oh, there you are. [CHUCKLES] I have a date at 10. You'll never make it. 11? Better. Watch my drink. [APPLAUSE] MONROE: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you. Thank you so much. I promise the speech will be later. But that doesn't mean you're off the hook. Thank you. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Right now, I'd like to introduce a very special guest, a lady who you'll probably remember from the city comptroller's office. Ms. Mary Lee Drummond. [APPLAUSE] Thank you. It's wonderful to be here tonight. - This is great, isn't it? - Yeah, it is. It's great. - This is great. It is. It's great. Eat your heart out, McGuire. Uh, Katwuller. I may call on you as a material witness. Go ahead. We've already resolved this between my client and the court. Put me on the stand. Choose my testifying as a basis for appeal. Smile. You look younger. MARY LEE DRUMMOND: And you already know he's the only one for the job. So it just makes sense that the vote for Bill Monroe is-- So I take it, uh, Monroe can't count on your vote, huh. Oh, I'm sure yours will make up for it. No, I'm just here for the free drinks. Right. Let's celebrate while my client sits in jail and her daughter's in some foster home someplace. Your boss is using this case to get himself elected. I find that obscene. Hey, look. I don't work for Monroe. I'm a cop. My job is to find out what happened, whether it helps his case or not, or yours. You understand? [APPLAUSE] Ellie. What? The bail hearing is Thursday. - What then? - Bail. You're not a danger to the general public. Ellie. - Hmm? - Damn it. Every time I say something, I either have to repeat myself or waive my hand in front of your face. Sorry. Listen to me. When I first saw you, met you again-- oh, damn it. Steven and I were-- I didn't know about you. I'm sorry. I do things sometimes-- often, without thinking, without asking too many questions. I look at you, and I see how much of my life has passed. Don't get me wrong. You look great. You do look great. It's me. I want to put an end to this. No. The night I was at your house, when I was with Steven-- Don't. Will you please shut up and listen? I killed him. Are you nuts? I could be. Insanity is a popular defense these days. What are you doing? Pleading guilty. Oh, no, you're not. Then I'll get another lawyer. Great. I'll recommend one. And how much will they be? Face it, Eleanor. You're cheap. - Cheap? - Yeah. Cheap. In school, all I remember were drawers full of panties with the elastic shot. Get out of here. Fine. I am pleading guilty. And nothing you can say or do is going to change that. Who are you protecting? No one. You're lying. You always were a lousy actress. I was not. Oh, please. I saw the junior play. I thought that's why you left college. [GASPS] Do not leave this room until you tell me the truth. I was very good in that play. I saved the reviews to prove it. Who are you protecting? And what makes you think you're so smart? What makes you think you know everything, miss smarty pants, miss everybody's favorite? You haven't changed that hair. T.K.: Hi. Oops, wait a minute. Cut the phone. I thought we'd go to the beach. I brought some suits. Aren't you embarrassed by this car? I'm having it painted. It's a mess. Your mother said-- She must be a mess. She is. I'm not a mess. But she's-- I'm living with people I don't even know. It won't be for long. I hate it. What's that noise? They still make these things? Probably not. My girlfriends have better cars than this. What is it? A classic. Here. We can change under our towels. Like surfers, huh. [MUSIC PLAYING] Does momma know you're screwing Steven? Did he tell you that? He didn't have to. I could tell by the way he ignored you at dinner. I'm a mess. [SIGHS] My girlfriend's father is a lawyer. And he has a Mercedes. She has a BMW. Let me ask you a question. The night your dad died, where were you? He didn't die. He was murdered. Where were you? A movie. By yourself? Why are you asking? Your mom just said-- My mother killed him. No. She hasn't told you? She didn't kill him. What makes you so fucking sure? Jesus. Just raise the red ones. That's all? Now, the blue. What color you call this? MAN 1: Brown. MAN 2: I already got a brown. It's kind of brownish purple-y. It's puce. When's lift up? We're getting there. Puce, huh. [PHONE RINGING] [PANTING] I got to give up smoking. Oh, shit. [PHONE RINGING] Hello? MAN: Himself. And so are you. Mr. Bodeck? MR. BODECK: You defended him. You know better than he was. Mr. Bodeck, what do you want? MR. BODECK: I want to talk. Where can we meet? Um. Uh, someplace public. Where are you? MR. BODECK: Hollywood. Near Western. T.K.: All right. Uh, there's a restaurant near you. Um, Gino's on Vine. It's almost to Willoughby. And I'll be there. You know, it will more than half an hour. And I'll be there. Wait, OK? OK? MAN: Hello? Detective Beutel. MAN: He's not here. Can I help you? - Oh. Uh, no. Never mind. Wait. Um, if he calls in, let him know I heard from Bodeck. B-O-D-E-C-K. I'm Katwuller. K-A-T-- [KNOCKING] Hang on. [SCREAMS] [GRUNTS] [SCREAMS] Don't try it. No. [GRUNTS] [ELEVATOR DINGS] [GRUNTS] BEUTEL: Bodeck! Can you reach your arm? Reach your arm. OK, hold on. I got you. Now, look. You're going to have let go. You understand? Not now. Now now. When I tell you. [PANTING] Ready? OK. Now. This was a setup? That's what this was? But what the hell, huh? At least we got Steven's murderer, right? You better go see Monroe. MONROE: Bodeck's not the guy. Oh, come on. The guy tried to kill me. He tried to kill a police officer. That doesn't mean he killed Seldes. This is stupid. What's going on? Hey, I'm not going to drop the charges. I'm three points ahead in the polls. You know something, Monroe. What is it? MONROE: Mrs. Bodeck, you've testified that your husband promised he would kill the man whom he held responsible for involving your daughter in the making of a pornographic film. MRS. BODECK: Yes, sir. That person being Mr. Seldes? MRS. BODECK: Yes, sir. He introduced her to the director. And had had sexual relations with her prior to that introduction. Yes. Mrs. Bodeck, had he also threatened to kill a Luthers Svoboda? Yes, sir. Who is Mr. Svoboda? His mechanic. And what was the basis for that threat? He fixed the clutch in our van. And it didn't work right. [LAUGHTER] MONROE: Had he also threatened the life of a Mr. Henley? MRS. BODECK: Yes, sir. MONROE: Your next door neighbor. He kept a lot of trash lying all around. And it would blow into our yard. [LAUGHTER] Mrs. Bodeck, did you ever discuss the night of May 17th, the night Mr. Seldes was killed with your husband? No, there wasn't much to discuss. Why not? Sherman had been out all night. He was drunk. And he didn't remember anything-- anything that happened. [PHONE RINGING] T.K.: Hello? BEUTEL: It's Beutel. How about a drink tonight? At 9:30? Don't worry. I'll pay the tab. MRS. BODECK: Glad you can make it. Great choice for a big night out. What's this all about? Hey, you want to go sit at the bar? Yeah, sure. We can see the fight better. Don't tell me you're a regular in this place. No. I know what this is. Monroe's got you working on me. He must really be desperate. You look pretty sharp in court today. Oh, yeah? Why were you there? I like to watch you work. You back again? I knew you were a regular. Still think I'll testify tomorrow? Yeah. I got to take a leak. Testify to what? Jeez, the guy is dead. Let him be. Who's dead? Sherman Bodeck. What are you drinking? I'll have what he's having. What about Sherman Bodeck? Like I'm supposed to remember something happened three, four months ago. You know where you were in May 17th? Twist? Yes, sure. MAN: Except that night, I remember. Why? Was he here? Yeah. 6:30 until closing. I threw him out personally. How can you be so sure? I mean, I don't even remember last Tuesday. MAN: May 17th. NBA championship. The Lakers 103, Celtics 100. I have 50 bucks in the Lakers with Sherman. Think that bastard ever paid me? Oh, boy. Why did you do that for me, hmm? BEUTEL: You know, I don't like the way Monroe plays politics. Anyway, I owed you one. How did you find him? Bodeck was in the Merchant Marines. It was his local hangout. He was my whole case. I'll have to start over. Well, thanks for letting me in on it. I just want to know the truth. That's all. MONROE: Detective Beutel, describe what you saw when you found the body. Uh, body was slumped on the toilet in the third booth. Fully dressed? Yes, sir. Was there any indication the body had been moved? No. What was the cause of death? Objection. Detective Beutel is not a medical expert. Sustained. You're instructed to disregard that last statement. What was the condition of the bathroom? The office men's room when you first entered it. Uh, sink was splattered with blood. There was paper towels scattered around and remains of ice cubes on the floor. MONROE: Ice cubes? Yes, sir. MONROE: Was there a refrigerator at Mr. Seldes' office? BEUTEL: In the hallway. The ice tray was empty. What are these circumstances lead you to conclude? That Mr. Seldes' nose was broken in his office. He used ice cubes to stem the blood. He went to men's room for cold water and sat on the John leaning his head back. MONROE: Where he was struck by his assailant. BEUTEL: Yes, sir. MONROE: Any evidence of a struggle? BEUTEL: At that point? MONROE: Yes. BEUTEL: No. MONROE: Leading you to conclude? That he knew the person who killed him. That's all. Detective Beutel, do you know me? Yes, I do. How many people do you suppose we know in a lifetime? I couldn't guess. T.K.: Well, try. A thousand? Probably more, 2,000. Three? Something like that. So it would be fair to say my client is one among 3,000 who knew Steven Seldes. Yeah. Describe the condition of Mr. Seldes' office. Things were shoved around. Nothing else? There was some blood. A lot, a little? Some. So there had been a struggle? Objection, your honor. That's calling for speculation. JUDGE: Sustained. In your years of experience, what would you generally conclude if things were shoved around in an office and you found blood, some blood? That there had probably been a struggle. Ah. Were there any traces leading to the men's room? Yes, ma'am. Regarding the sweater identified as pupil seven, where was it found? About 30 feet south of the building on a pile of trash. It was in plain sight? Yes. Have you found the murder weapon? - No. - You've looked? Yes. What were you looking for? The murder weapon. Which was? A knife. What kind of knife? We never found it. Uh, the office-- BEUTEL: Which office? Detective Beutel, wait for the question before responding. T.K.: Mr. Seldes' office. We're back. Do you find it peculiar that the struggle took place there and the murder elsewhere? Somewhat. Which side of peculiar does somewhat fall on? Very or not worth mentioning? Oh, it's worth mentioning. T.K.: How tall was the victim? About 6 foot. And how much did he weigh? Uh, 175, maybe more. T.K.: According to the coroner's report, defendant's Exhibit C, Mr. Seldes was 6 feet, 2 and 1/2 inches and 182 pounds. Would you please stand up, Ellie? Could you look at the defendant and tell me what you estimate her height to be? 5'4", 5'6" maybe. Weight? 110, 115. It's not bad. Give or take a few pounds. Now, let me see if I get the picture how-- how you and your department and the prosecution reconstructed the crime. We have a woman who's 5' 4 and 1/2" beating up a man who's 6'2" and weighs a ton. MONROE: Your honor-- Causing him to what? Flee her superior strength, take refuge in the men's room, sit down to catch his breath and allow his wife in hot pursuit, I suppose, to strike him repeatedly with a weapon, whatever it was. By the way, how many times was he struck? 18 times. All about the neck and shoulders? No. There were two wounds in the left arm. How do you count for that? For what? That a man would allow himself to be struck with a deadly instrument 18 times without defending himself. It could have been the first blow that killed him. Or the 9th, or the 18th. When you arrested Mrs. Seldes the next morning, were there any signs of her being in a violent struggle, a struggle with a man fighting for his life? No. No cuts, bruises? A broken nail perhaps? No. None of the above. No. So we are to assume Mr. Seldes exhausted himself in the struggle while never laying a hand on her, fled to the men's room while stopping off for ice, sat down on the nearest thing at hand and-- help me here, simply gave up, threw his head back and allowed her to hack him to death? MONROE: Objection, your honor. Compound and argumentative. Detective Beutel, do you understand the question? Yes, I do. JUDGE: Overruled. You may answer. I don't assume anything. T.K.: Of course, you don't. I understand that. But doesn't it seem peculiar to you that my client, supposedly having done this deed, carelessly places a devastatingly incriminating piece of evidence in plain sight in front of the building that was the scene of the crime? And yet has the presence of mind to hide a murder weapon so cleverly that it's never been found to this day. MONROE: Objection. It's all very logical. It's compelling. No. Really, it's fascinating. MONROE: Your honor, objection. JUDGE: Sustained. - That's all for now. Eager for more blood? [SCOFFS] I had to go after you. You know that. Yeah, it was very professional. I didn't particularly enjoy it. Well, I sort of enjoyed it. Hmm. Is this some kind of apology? I want to thank you for helping me with Bodeck. It's not over yet. I still haven't found Jack Hammer. Well, the funny thing about evidence, you know, it cuts both ways. It proves innocence as well as guilt. I've made some terrible mistakes. I'm not going to make them again. You and Seldes, how close were you? He was my client. See you in court. MAN: The one on top's from the sweater. The bottom's the one you gave me. BEUTEL: Do they match? Do they match? [PHONE RINGING] Hello? RUSSELL: I think this might be an excellent time to talk about my raise. What? RUSSELL: It's Russell. Guess what? I found your missing sleazeball. He's made a very interesting career move. In fact, more movie stars are buried here than in any other cemetery in LA. OK, folks. If you could just step lively into the chapel. We're running a little behind schedule. So I'd appreciate it, OK? T.K.: Jack Hammer? Yeah. Who are you? I want to talk about Steven Seldes. You're the lawyer? Yeah. Fuck you. Fine. Tell it in court. I can have you subpoenaed. You knew that. What the hell? I'm still giving people what they want. Sex, death, fans entertainment. I want to know who he owed, who was after him, anything, anything you can tell me. You mean, who might have killed him? Yeah. Me. I got him into the business. It was a recession-proof gig. You know what I mean? Oh, man, I should've known better. Once a fuck up, always a fuck up. I don't know who killed him. It could have been anybody. I want names. I can make you testify. What was it with you two? He was strictly into jailbait. You really didn't know what was going on, did you? I thought that's what turns you on. No? It doesn't turn you on? What are you talking about? Ask his daughter. Check into his private stock. You might get to like it. Hi, Janna. Tell me about the tapes. What tapes? T.K.: I talked to Jack Hammer. He's a geek. Why do you want to bother with him? To find out. About what? Steven. What would he know? Nobody knew anything about Steven. - Did you? - What? Know about him? [SIGHS] Why don't you go? What's wrong with you? I'm not interested, OK? This doesn't interest me. It's boring. [SIGHS] Then I'll go. Not until you tell me. Who are you anyway? You were nothing to Steven. You were just some hag he was sleeping with, some cheap piece of thread. You don't have the right to do that. You're not my mother. Then why doesn't she do it? Ask her. You ask her why. I just want to get this whole thing over with. You ask her who killed daddy. Ask her. Oh, god. Why can't I get somebody to help me? I'll help you. [CRYING] You can't. I will. I'll help. You'll hate me. No. Oh, you will. [KNOCKING] Who is it? It's Janna. [MUSIC PLAYING] How long have you known? What? Which? Uh. When she started hating me, then I guess I knew. Then she hated me because I knew. She began to flaunt it, replacing me. She replaced me. But do you know the worst part? I let her do it. What would you have done? Oh, forget that. Forget I asked it. I should have ended it. But I had nowhere to go. Steven was all I had. Ever. She made him happy. T.K.: She killed him, didn't she? If you allow me to show the tape, you'll be acquitted. Ellie, allow me. The court's extremely protective of abused children. And no one in their right mind will blame her for killing him. The jury will understand. As long as there is breath in my body, I will not allow my daughter to be exposed to this. T.K.: She needs to confess. It would be terrible to make her bury this. She'd never ever recover from it. You cannot do this. I forbid it. Listen to me, damn you. I forbid it. I forbid it! [CRIES] Would you read the verdict, please? Title of court and cause. We, the jury, in the above entitled action, find the defendant Eleanor Seldes not guilty of first degree murder in violation of penal code section 187A. A felony is charged in count one of the information. I had to this. Please understand. Bye. Steven's case. BEUTEL: Guess you're more than just his lawyer, huh. This was in your car. Somebody called the station, didn't leave a name. Better get dressed. Someone put it in my car. Someone's lying. Who? I'm not sure. I don't-- I'll check the knife for prints. If you're being set up, you've got nothing to worry about. My prints are on the knife. I didn't tell you everything that night. Steven and I fought. But look, I didn't kill him. That's the truth. You haven't told the truth from day one about anything. You got this all screwed around. I don't think so. I wish I did. But I don't think so. [ELEVATOR DINGS] Well, I bought you some cigarettes. You haven't quit, have you? Ain't this place awful? You feel so at the mercy of things. When I was here-- Why are you here? To offer my help. It may seem strange under the circumstances but I'm grateful. For me, there'll be no more judges or juries. They could never try me again, thanks to you. So tell me, how can I help? You need money? Maybe I-- Who put the knife in my car? Who called the police? Who killed Steven? If you think you're protecting Janna, you're completely-- She's going to be fine. Janna doesn't need protecting anymore. I knew you were sleeping with Steven the night you came to our house for dinner the minute I saw you standing there dressed in white. We were miles from summer. You know, for a Phi Beta Kappa, you really are fairly stupid. Call me if you need me. BEUTEL: How about the truth this time? [GASPS] Go upstairs, please, Janna. Go upstairs. How did you get out? You want to kill me too? You know I didn't kill Steven. Why did they arrest you? I think you know why. [SIGHS] Can't you leave us alone? Haven't you hurt this family enough? Get out of here. I have to fix dinner. T.K.: Was he worth all this? Steven? Don't make me laugh. Steven, I will laugh. Steven wasn't worth anything. Nothing. Don't you think I know that? Worth 20 years? He got 20 years out of my life! But he was all I had. Get out. Why are you still here? Why don't you leave? And I'm sick of potatoes. But I'm still fixing them. Am I not a joke? Stop it. How many ways can you fix potatoes? Ask me how many ways. Ask me how many. Lots. Stop it! People have to eat. You're acting like you weren't even a part of it. Part of what? Your life, for one thing. Steven, Janna, part of me. Ugh. Oh, god. Why do I even bother? I don't even like you. I have never liked you, Eleanor. From the moment I met you, blaming the world, blaming the weather for anything, everything that happens. Christ! If they don't hurt us, why you hurt us? You want to see what hurt is? This is hurt! See it? This is it. Hurt. Hurt. Eleanor, don't. That's hurt. See it? I just want to talk to you. Stay away from me. Am I supposed to feel sorry for you? You killed Steven, didn't you? Didn't you? Leave me alone! Move away from-- No. I'm not going to stop you. You can't do this anymore. You used me. You even used your daughter. No. I wanted her free, free of Steven, free of me. [GASPS] ÷¦ went there that night to do this. And then I saw you. I killed him. I stabbed him over and over. There's no one left to blame. Just you. Time to end it, Ellie. End it. Enough! I'm so sorry. I'll take care of you. It's my idea. Sorry you had to go through all that. For the road. [MUSIC PLAYING]
