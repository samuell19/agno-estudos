I'll get the purse. No. You bump her. No, I'll get the purse. No, you took the purse last time. Rat. (YELLING) I told you once! Now get the hell out of here. (YELLS) (PEOPLE SHOUTING) OLD WOMAN: Oh!

(GUN FIRES) (SCREAMS) (SIREN WAILING) OFFICER: All right folks, give way here, please. Move back. (INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER) (REPORTER SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) REPORTER: Guys, are you sure you're getting the body behind me in the shot? Get 'em the fuck outta here! TINA: You're gonna have to move. Look, people, you gotta clear out of here. (SAXOPHONE PLAYING UPBEAT TUNE) (THUNDER RUMBLING) Up the stairs and to the right, Lieutenant. MAN: Stop playin' the damn thing! Tina! Come see what the cat dragged in. I want that body off the street. Yeah, okay. Wait till you see the meat inside. (CHUCKLES) Spank me! Some setup, huh? Belonged to the gal that blew her brains out. Judy Cavallo. 29. A couple of priors. Soliciting, nothing heavy. The guy at the desk says she's been working up here for about eight months. Plush. Yeah. I figure somebody had to set her up in business. Maybe Jim Dandy over here. (THUNDER RUMBLING) COOPER: She cut him up before she popped his noggin. Uh, Cain, what's the matter? You losing your appetite for this kind a shit? Positive it's Harper? TINA: ID was in his wallet. Mr. Religion himself. Wonder what the faithful flock's gonna think about this little episode? Can we get him out of here? TINA: Yeah. We're done here. (THUNDER RUMBLING) (WIND CHIMES TINKLING) I'm hungry. Wanna grab a little sushi? I mean, we're down here. No. I got somethin' I'm working on. Okay. See you later. Yeah. See you, manana. Goodnight, Tina... (POLICE SIREN WAILING) Hey, man. What you doin' here all by yourself, honey? Beat it. If you're lost, maybe I can help you find your way home? I'm not interested. Maybe this'll change your mind? (SIGHS) Put it away, Cayla, before I run you in. Okay. But I'm saving a special piece for you, baby. One of these days you ain't gonna be able to resist. Why don't you go on home and get out of the rain? Okay. But remember, any time, any place. (MAN LAUGHING) DETECTIVE: Good morning, Cain. MAN: Yeah, no, no, no... BADER: Every goddamn female reporter in LA can tickle your balls and you sing like a fuckin' nightingale! I'm tellin' you to keep your mouth shut! If I hear you leaked to the press again I'll bust you back to the goddamn street! You wanted to see me? What the hell happened with the Ellis case? What do you mean? I mean I got a fucking assistant D.A. kickin' my ass because he lost the case. He says you fucked it up so bad Ellis walked. Hmm... We got our wires crossed. No, you got your wires crossed! No probably cause. Sloppy arrest. What the hell are you doing out there? Damn, I expect it from the rest of these boneheads but not you, John. Bobby's, uh, Bobby's screwing some other guy. She's leavin' me. Oh, shit. Why? I don't know... Why what? I mean, why's she screwing the guy or why's she leaving? Well, they usually go hand in hand. (SIGHS) She doesn't know me anymore. Well, maybe that's her problem. No, she's right. I wake up in the morning and I don't know where to start. I go to bed at night and nothing I've done makes any sense. And I'm scared. I'm really scared. What, do you wanna see a department shrink? No. I think it's time to quit. I just... I gotta have some time alone. I got a better idea. Here. Pick up Geronimo. He's that Indian that killed those two women out at the beach. The, uh, tribal police ran him down on the reservation for us. Now you let Tina and Cooper handle the Harper case and you get out of here for a few days. Open spaces. It'll be good for you. Put some distance between you and all this shit. And if it's still a problem when you get back, then we'll deal with it. Okay? Aren't we gonna talk about this? You don't get it do you, John? Nothin' left to even talk about. You're gonna leave just like that? You think this is just happening now? Suddenly you wanna talk things out? It doesn't work like that. I wanted to talk for months. For years. You were never home. And when you were home you wouldn't talk. So we just pretended to love each other. (HORN HONKS) I'm tired of pretending. (HORN BLARING) I still love you, Bobby. (CAR ENGINE STARTS) MAN ON RADIO: Well, prepare yourselves for another 20 minutes of commercial-free blues coming to you from the Power Desert Station right here in Phoenix. (VOICES WHISPERING) BOBBY: So we just pretended to love each other. I'm tired of pretending. BADER: What the hell are you doin' out here? COOPER: What's the matter, Cain? You lost your appetite for this? CAIN: I don't wanna know... BOBBY: I don't know you anymore... BADER: You wanna see a department shrink? BOBBY: Now? CAIN: I really don't care anymore. BOBBY: I think I finally figured out what this teacher expects from us. CAIN: Was that before or after you started fuckin' him? BOBBY: You followed me! (TRUCK HORN BLARING) (SIGHS) (COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING) What kinda beer you got? Sorry, no alcohol in the reservation. Okay. Coffee black. (CLEARS THROAT) Thanks. You must be Mr. Cain. Yes, ma'am. Totsoni said to expect you. He ain't gonna be able to meet you tonight. But he'll be up at his office tomorrow at 9:00. It's just a few miles up the road. My name's Hattie Moore. And this here's my husband. Percival John, but, uh, folks around here call me P.J. Good to make your acquaintance. Quite a place you got here. Well, thank you. Ol' man Phipps he bought this place in '22. He was the first trader. We bought the place from him in 1961, day we got married. That's a long time. Place kinda grows on you. Why don't you go on up and get Mr. Cain's room fixed up while I feed him? You bet. I meant it was a long time to be married. What can I get you to eat? What's good? Stew and fry bread. Okay. Hey. Are you the fella that come to arrest Coyote Man? Yeah, I am. Too bad... for you. (CHILDREN GIGGLING) I'm sorry I'm late, Mr. Cain. I'm Frank Totsoni. This is Daniel Nez. I've been waitin' here for over an hour. Well, I was down near the Little Colorado. Your girl says the prisoner's not here. That's right. He's up in Shonto. They're bringing him down right now. Why didn't I just go up there in the first place? Because I decided to do it this way. Have a seat, Mr. Cain. We can't prove it but we think he's responsible for three killings on the reservation. One of his victims was half-skinned alive. People around here are scared of Nakai Twobear. He kills for power. Nobody in Tuba City wanted him around. So we kept him in Shonto. What is this guy? The Boogie Man? In a way. They're here. Put him in the back of the Chevy. I need you to sign this release for me. These are his things. What the fuck are you smiling about? I see what you mean. He looks like he could skin somebody alive. Do yourself a favor. Don't give him an inch. Thanks. Sure glad it ain't me drivin' him back. Did you see the way Twobear looked at him? I know. (EAGLE SCREAMING) (COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING) (STATIC SCREECHING) (MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING) (VOICES WHISPERING) (VOICE GROWS LOUDER) (TIRES SCREECHING) BOBBY: Is he all right? MAN: Looks like he's in real trouble. BOBBY: John, can you hear me? MAN: Cain. Buddy. No. He needs help. BOBBY: Somebody's gotta help him. MAN: Yes. BOBBY: He can't hear us. MAN: No. John, you... He's lost a lot of blood. BOBBY: John, it's me. MAN: Don't worry. BOBBY: Is he all right? MAN: No, he's in real trouble. BOBBY: I don't know. MAN: Hey, buddy. It's me... I think he's waking up. (WOMAN SPEAKING OVER PA) Welcome back, Mr. Cain. What happened? You had an accident. You've been out for quite a while. We were starting to get worried about you. How are you feeling? Like somebody just kicked my ass from here to Detroit. (LAUGHS) That's a good analogy. Now follow my finger. Any numbness in your arms or legs? No. (THUNDER RUMBLING) Let's see if you can sit up. Dizzy? No. My head feels like it's gonna explode. You experienced a bad impact trauma. But the X-rays don't show any fractures. And I put a couple of stitches in. I'd say you were pretty lucky. Twobear? A couple of Hopis spotted the wreck. By the time they reported it and we got there, Twobear was long gone. My gun? Everything you had on you is gone. (SIGHS) What happened? Oh, I... I can't remember. Something... It was like something in the road... I can't remember. Frank. Yeah? His boss is on the phone again. TOTSONI: Have 'em put it through in here. NEZ: All right. Your Captain's been calling all afternoon. Have you told him what happened? I had to. Great. (PHONE RINGS) Hi, Jake. Had me sweatin' bullets there for a while, Cain. Good thing it was your head, where the least amount of damage could be done. Jake, I'm sorry about this mess. I don't know how it happened but... I'll take care of it. I'll go after him. BADER: Maybe you were right. It was stupid of me to send you up there when all this other shit happened to you. I just think it's better if I send somebody else. He's got my gun and my shield, Jake. Please let me do this. Please. BADER: I don't know. Let me talk to the doctor. He wants to talk to you. Yes, sir. BADER: How bad is he? He seems to be all right but I'd like to keep an eye on him over night. You sure? Yes. Put him back on. CAIN: Uh-huh. It's against my better judgment so be careful. All right? Yeah. Thanks, Jake. So, tomorrow you give me a clean bill of health and we'll start looking for this son of a bitch. One thing. This is the reservation. We do things our own way. That shouldn't be a problem. I hope not. Goodnight, Mr. Cain. Could we drop the "mister"? People just call me Cain. (GROANS) (VOICES WHISPERING) (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) What are you doing out there? Hattie. Hattie, you should see the ring around the moon. If you'd stop daydreaming and get them floors done, we could get to bed. (LAUGHS) Well, now girl, that's about the best idea you've had all day! Good god, old man! What've you been smokin'? Now stop it, I said, and I mean it. All right! Finish them floors. Then we'll see. (WIND CHIMES TINKLING) Who the hell's that? (DISTANT HOWLS) HATTIE: What is it? I don't see nobody out here. Jesse! (WHISTLING) Jesse! Jesse, dog. Come here, boy. (WIND CHIMES TINKLING) Where'd you come from? (GRUNTS) P.J.? No! (GROANS) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (GUN FIRING) Sheepherder found P.J.'s jeep abandoned up near Navajo Mountain. CAIN: Are you sure it was Twobear? The old man at the trading post identified him. Is he gonna make it? He died about an hour ago. It must have happened a little before midnight. He stabbed P.J. and shot his wife. Nine millimeter. The one he took from me was a nine. (GRUMBLES UNINTELLIGIBLY) (HORSE NEIGHING) (SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) MAN: Oh! How're you feeling, Mr. Cain? Better. What's all this? TOTSONI: This is as far as you can get a vehicle. We'll have to go in after him on horses. You're kiddin'. You sure you're up to this? You don't have to, you know. We can handle it. No. No. No, I wanna do it. Ray Whitesinger will track for us. Ray's the best on the reservation. How much head start's he got? He's been in foot at least six hours. Does he know the area? Like the back of his hand. He was born and raised out here. One of Moore's rifles is missing from his gun case. A lot of ammo too. So he's got plenty of fire power. Shit. He's got a sweet tooth. TOTSONI: Cain, this is Ray Whitesinger. The only things he's packing are guns, candy and jerky. There was a beefy smell in the car when we opened it. He's traveling light. You can tell by the tracks he left. Which way is he headed? North, into Horse Canyon. He left a good false trail towards Chaiyahi Flats. I almost fell for it. CAIN: Maybe it's not a false trail. If I wanted to make some fast time I'd use the flats, not that canyon. Well, we're not tracking you, are we, Mr. Cain? Look, if we're gonna be partners... First of all, I'm not your partner. And second, I know Nakai Twobear. I'm the one that tracked him so you could let him go. Ray... From the looks of it I'd say your butt's never been on a horse and you're in the middle of 10,000 square miles of badlands and you don't know which way's up. So why don't you sit back and let me do my job. You might learn something. All right, this isn't LA and I've only been on horse a few times. I've tracked a man before. Not out here you haven't. You'll need this. (EAGLE SCREAMING) He's cross-tracking. We'll split up. You and Begay drop down into the canyon and double back. The rest of us will follow this track. We'll meet up at Sleeping Springs. We're on his trail, why split up? A trail isn't just a series of tracks. It's an animal's ways. For the last two miles he's been cross-tracking between the canyon and the rim. If he's in the canyon, Totsoni and the others will flush him out. Go easy on the water, Mr. Cain. Look, why don't we bury the hatchet? Bad choice of words. If I were you, I wouldn't push my luck. Here. You better take these. It gets pretty cold at night here. Are these things clean? Yeah. Only wore 'em twice. (CLICKS TONGUE) It's about 12:30. He was here just a few hours ago. (HORSE NEIGHS) (EAGLE SCREAMS) What is it? Nothin'. Can you tell me how to get rid of this pain? My butt feels like a piece of raw meat. Quit fighting your horse. You're not moving with it. I watched you all day. You're really good at this tracking. Where'd you learn it? My father was a tracker. Was? He was drunk when he tracked a killer into Chaco hills. The killer ambushed him. (SIGHS) Totsoni tells me you have a degree in criminology. Does that surprise you? No. My father never liked the idea of me going to college. He thought all the reading would ruin my eyes for tracking. Begay says there's a Listening Woman who lives about a mile up the canyon. I think we should talk to her in the morning. It's worth a try. We'll take a watch in one hour shifts. Nez'll take the first one. Sleep well, Mr. Cain. You too. You married, Totsoni? No. She'd be a handful. She's already married. Maybe there's something else you should know. Nakai Twobear killed Ray's father. (COYOTES HOWLING) (VOICES WHISPERING) (GROWLING) (COYOTE HOWLING) What is it, Trickster? (GROWLS) You wanna play? Let's play. (HORSE SNORTING) (HORSE NEIGHING SOFTLY) Totsoni! Totsoni! Totsoni... Nez! Nez! Ray! (BREATHES HEAVILY) (EAGLE SCREAMS) (GASPS) (PANTING) You okay? Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. (GOAT BLEATING IN DISTANCE) CAIN: Why do you call her a Listening Woman? TOTSONI: She has a gift for telling people what makes them ill. By listening to nature. CAIN: She's pretty old to be out here by herself. Her husband was a medicine man. When a medicine man dies they burn his hogan and everything in it. His wife is forced to leave her clan and make her own way. Friendly custom. Navajo fear the dead more than anything else. (GOAT BLEATING) What did she say? RAY: She didn't see anyone. But she felt the presence of a Coyote Man pass by here yesterday. That's what a guy called him in Tuba City. What's a Coyote Man? It's like what you call a witch or a sorcerer. We call 'em Coyote Men. Skin-walkers. (SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE) What's that all about? Nothing. Let's get goin'. You take the canyon. We'll pick up where his rim track faded into the water. What if he heads out over the high grass? RAY: He won't. It's too wide open on the flatlands. Look, I don't wanna start anything again but what if Totsoni's right? I'm thinking about what I would do if I were in his shoes. Maybe he's playin' the same game. If we don't run him down by sunset we'll meet at the Abajo. Begay, you know where it is? Yeah. CAIN: I hope you're right. If I'm not I'm sure you'll be the first to let me know. RAY: The Listening Woman talked about a skin-walker living in some Anasazi ruins near Spider Rock. There's no ruins by Spider Rock. She probably meant Betatakin. But that's 20 miles east of here. What do skin-walkers do? Navajos don't like to talk about skin-walkers much. They dig up corpses and eat the flesh. Some of 'em can change into animals. But most of all they like to find a rope of sand an' walk inside 'em. CAIN: What's the rope of sand? It's someone who is weak but was strong before. Someone who's life is out of harmony. Totsoni said Twobear killed for power. What did he mean by that? Skin-walkers kill animals or the people. The strength gives them the power to make ghost sickness. Spread out in the wash and look for tracks. (VOICES WHISPERING) TOTSONI: It's like what you call a witch or a sorcerer. Skin-walkers. (GRUNTING) P.J.! (NEIGHING) Nez, tell me about ghost sickness. My grandfather knew a man down by Many Farms. A skin-walker got inside him, he ended up killin' his wife and four kids. Then he took a millstone and cracked his own head open. How's it work? How's he make 'em sick? They all got a special bone bead. Just like this, only made from the bone of a corpse. Somehow they find a way to get it under your skin and then they've got you. They walk inside your dreams till you get so weak you can't fight 'em. Then they suck out the bone bead and take your soul. You better ride to the Abajo. He's headed out across the high grass. It's two hours to the Abajo. It'll be dark by the time I get there. You could camp out there tonight and pick up our trail in the morning. I'll make it easy for you. If you ride hard you can catch us by late afternoon. What if you two run him down before we catch up? We'll cross that bridge when we come to it. Whoa! Whoa! Aren't you gonna say I told you so? I'm not here to fight with you. Hell, I fucked up and let him get away in the first place. I just wanna find the son of a bitch. CAIN: God, it's beautiful. Come on. CAIN: It's strange. RAY: What's that? The silence. God, it's quiet out here. That's what I always hated about the city. The constant noise. When we were first married, my wife and I used to go to this cabin in the mountains. It was quiet there too. I mean not like this but a lot better than the city. It was her favorite place. Well, maybe when this is over you can bring her up here. I don't think so. We just separated. How long you been married? Almost three years. It'd be nine for us this April. Do you have any children, Mr. Cain? No. We were going to in the beginning. But then I went into Homicide. After a while it didn't seem to matter anymore. Nothin' mattered. Not me, not her. Just nothin'. CAIN: I can't see anything. Guess he's usin' the water to hide his tracks, huh? Maybe. It's an old Indian trick. Saw it in a John Wayne movie. Bet it didn't fool ol' big John though, did it? (LAUGHS) Can't figure this guy out, Ray. I mean, he leaves a trail of candy wrappers and food I could even follow and all of a sudden he cleans up his act and starts coverin' his tracks. I don't think he went into the water. CAIN: Why not? These tracks, they're deeper than they should be. And they're not clean. He stepped in 'em twice, backtracking. Shit! What? Ride! Ride! What's happenin'? Ride! (GUN FIRING) (RAY SCREAMS) Ray! (GUN FIRING) (GUN FIRING) (HORSE NEIGHING) Ray! Ray! (GROANS) (GROANS) (INAUDIBLE) (PANTING) (TWOBEAR'S LAUGHTER ECHOES) (GROANS) (COUGHS) Stay still. Stay still. TWOBEAR: This time it was the horses! Next time it's the woman! Stay down. I'll draw his fire. (TWOBEAR LAUGHING MANIACALLY) (TWOBEAR HOWLING) (SHOUTING IN NATIVE LANGUAGE) (TWOBEAR CONTINUES LAUGHING) (NEIGHS SOFTLY) (TWOBEAR CRIES IN MOCKERY) (SHOUTING IN NATIVE LANGUAGE) (CONTINUES LAUGHING) (GUN FIRES) (THUNDER RUMBLING) There's a storm moving in. What's that stuff you're mixin'? Some pinyon and mesquite gum. It'll help the infection. We'll wait for the others to catch up and then you can go back. No. You've lost a lot of blood and you could use some stitches. I'll be all right. Thank you for what you did today. Why didn't he kill us? What happened when you were taking him back to Los Angeles? I had an accident with a car and I was unconscious. He got away. Is that all? (GROANS) Why? You asked what the Listening Woman yelled at you this morning. She said you have the ghost sickness. Totsoni and the others think Twobear's walking inside you. That's ridiculous. Is it? I can see it in your eyes. They're dulled with confusion. And your body's weak with a heart that's broken. Come on, Ray. You don't believe that fuckin' hocus pocus. What the hell makes you people think your magic is real and everyone else's is hocus pocus? Your prophets can raise the dead and part the seas and ours is just bullshit. Let me tell you something, my friend, our ancestors have practiced their medicine for ten thousand years. It's real and it's powerful. You're wrong. That old woman's wrong. (SHIVERING) I hope so. For both our sakes. I've lost his trail. Just keep lookin'. TOTSONI: Up here! CAIN: How'd you know it's a coyote? RAY: A coyote's tracks are very different. It's outer toe pads are bigger than the inner ones. This is a male. About 50 pounds. What're you gettin' at? When Twobear was laying out that phony ambush trail, I think he picked up a hungry coyote that found a food source. So the coyote's trackin' Twobear and he'll lead us right to him. If he doesn't get bored or find another source of food. We better get going. How do you know he's a male? Stands on three legs when it pisses. They camped here last night! How many? Just two. Ray and the cop. BEGAY: Why does he kill the horse's and not them? He will... Once he's done, playin' with 'em. Man, this is bad. They're no match for Twobear. You shouldn't have let them go on by themselves. You know Whitesinger. You can't tell her nothin'. What's done is done! The tracks head north to Spider Canyon. That Listening Woman told Whitesinger something about a skin-walker living around Spider Rock. They should've caught up with us by now. The wind probably slowed them down. How's your arm? Ah, it's all right. You have a fever. You really should go back. Not until I get him. I know Totsoni told you about Twobear and my father. I don't want you to feel obligated. CAIN: I'm sorry. Ray, I'm sorry. I know you're married. I... I shouldn't have done that. I haven't seen my husband in six months. He came home for a few days and he stole $300 from me. I wanted you to do it. That's what scares me. (MOANS) (GROWLS) (SHIVERING) He's in your dreams, isn't he? It's more than my dreams! He's inside me. I can feel him inside me. Christ, I can even smell him! Jesus, I'm goin' crazy. Oh, no you're not. It's real. He's very powerful. (GROANS) You need a medicine man or you'll die before we get back. Your only chance is to find Twobear and kill him. Just kill him. (SHIVERING) I can't. You have no choice. When the time comes, when he has taken everything from you and the fear has no hold on you anymore, then you fight back and do what you have to do or you'll die. (COYOTE HOWLING) RAY: The Listening Woman was right. There is an Anasazi ruin here. It's a place of power. I can feel it. (HOWLS CONTINUE) He's there. RAY: Don't look down! (PANTING) (GRUNTS) (PANTING) How much further? About a hundred feet. I can't make it. Yes, you can! It hurts too much! Don't think about it. I can't help it! (SOBBING) I can't help it. I can't help it. Listen to the wind. The what? Listen to the wind! Just concentrate on the wind. Can you hear it? (WIND BLOWING SOFTLY) Yeah. Yeah. Block out everything else. No pain. No fear. Only the wind. (PANTING) Come on. (GROANS) (GROANING) Are you okay? Yeah. Okay, let's go. (PANTING) I can see the top. (GROANS) (WHISPERS) Ray! (GROANS) (MUFFLED CRY) (SCREAMS) Shut up! You scream again and I'll kill you right now. (EXHALES) (GROANS) (MOANS) (GROANING) (GROANING) (TWOBEAR GROANS) (RAY GRUNTS) (RATTLING) (LAUGHS) (SHOUTING) I'm comin' back.

Because you think about losing. (GRUNTING) (GROANS) (GRUNTING) (RAY CRIES) (GROANS) (CREAKING) (CRIES) You're an easy man to walk inside, ain't ya. It was in your eyes the first time I seen ya. Fuck you. Them is just words. Words don't mean nothin'. (GRUNTS) When I'm walkin' inside of you, I know your fears. And what you fear the most is yourself. (MOANING) Maybe I'm doin' you a favor by killing you. (CREAKING) (GROANS) (RAY'S CRIES ECHOING) Yeah, I'm gonna kill you. And then I'm gonna peel the skin off the woman while she's still alive. There ain't nothin' you can do about it, is there? (GROANS) You started givin' up and now there's nothin' left for you to do. Your fear is my strength. (GROANS) You take this gun. Take it. That's good. Yeah, that's the easy part. Now here's the hard part. (SOBBING) Go ahead. Kill me. (CONTINUES SOBBING) Yeah, you can feel me inside you, can't you? (SCREAMS) (WHIMPERING) Walkin' inside you is like walkin' in an empty room. (GROANS) (GROANING) (PANTING) (GROWLING) Oh! Ah! Nakai! (CAIN MOANING) (COYOTE GROWLING) Get away from him! That rifle don't work. It jammed up on me when I killed your horses. (LAUGHS) (GROANS) (CLICKS) (GROANS) (CONTINUES LAUGHING) (CLICKS) (GUN FIRES) (SCREAMS) Oh! (LAUGHS) (GRUNTING) (SCREAMING) (GROANS) (GRUNTS) I can't! Yes, you can. Yes, you can. Ray, the wind. Remember? (WIND BLOWING SOFTLY) Listen to the wind. Listen to it. (PANTING) On three. One, two, three! (GRUNTING) (BOTH PANTING) Are you all right? (EAGLE SCREAMING) Why do I get the feeling that none of this was an accident? Life leaves nothing to chance. Fate has a way of bringing certain people together. The thing between you and Nakai Twobear can teach you a lot about yourself if you let it. What about the thing between you and me? (SIGHS) I need this. I can't live in your world. I tried. Then I'll have to try living in yours. TOTSONI: Whitesinger! It's Totsoni! Is Cain with you? I'm here! Are you two okay? Yes!
