PAINKILLERS I'm the son of the famous timpanist Frederik Eduard Spicht. I've played a long time. A very long time. Since I was two. Your style is a bit harsh. This is an orchestra. Youth orchestra? I'm here for the brass band. This is not a brass band. What instrument do you play? Triangle. Casper van Riel? Go ahead. - Is this new? - Yes. That's enough. I'm sorry. You're too late, you look like a tramp... and now you won't play what's written. You can leave. Why did you play something else? I heard those notes in my head and... And then you just fooled around. I want to become a composer. How did you like this piece? Nice. A bit... A bit average. It had no feeling. No feeling? What does a kid know about feelings? Felix composed this piece. One more question. The orchestra requires a lot of your time. Would your parents mind? My mom would love it. And your father? He has no opinion. Hey, you can't just grab food from my plate. That's not a plate. It's a box. I like this. What is it? Four Cheese Delicacy. You can say that again. How was your audition? What did I say? Forget about her. I thought she started to feel more for me. You're in the friend zone. You know each other too well. You know where Sofie is? Yes. There. - You're coming with me. - Dad? Come, let's go. - I told you to be outside at twelve. - I lost track of time. Because of that guy in your arms. - I wanted to thank him. - Why? He bought me a drink. Grab your coat. Can you ride with us? My dad is furious. Please? Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against Moroccans. As long as they stay in their own country. There they are ordinary Moroccans, here they are troublemakers. 'What's the problem?' The problem is that you're not adapting. Thanks for the ride. You're lucky you don't have a father. I do have a father. But he's a drifter. Huh? All I know is his name. Will you try to find him? My mother doesn't want me to. And you? I'm going to bed. Are you texting that Moroccan? No, Casper. He's a nice kid. Hi Cas. I was wondering... - Will you go out with me tonight? - What? Grab a movie. Or don't you want to? Okay. - Will you pick me up? - Yeah, sure. Okay. Seven o'clock. Hi Nina. Is she in her office? No. - Is she in court? - I think she's seeing a client. A client. Sixteenth... AVL hospital. Is that Anthony van Leeuwenhoek? Yep. - Is that a client? - Maybe she's visiting someone. But they only treat cancer. We don't know anybody with cancer. You've reached Marit van Rien. I can't answer the phone right now. So I'll see you again next week. Mom? When will you start chemo? They'll try surgery first. See if they can remove it. Hey... You're not going to lose me. They let me join the orchestra. What, really? I'm so proud of you. What are you doing? I'm telling Sofie I can't make it tonight. Why would you do that? Hey, Cas. Just go. - Hi. - Let's go straight away. Hi Cas. Aren't you coming in? It'll be sold out if we don't go now. What time shall I pick you up? I can bring her home. Even better. I'm so glad she's dating you now. You can stop at the next corner. Why? Sa?d is waiting there. - Aren't we going to see a movie? - We are. But Sa?d is joining us. Isn't that fun? He can drive me, that's less heavy for you. - Why don't you just go together? - Are you sure? I'd just be in your way. Okay. Bye. Mom, are you alright? Yes, I'm okay. - Shouldn't you take it easy? - I want to finish this. Let me do it. Can you grab those? Snow in March. Eye to Eye with van Laren Optician. - Did you sleep well? - I should ask you. I didn't. But coffee does magic. Too bad you don't like it. Will I forever wake up with a sting in my life over you? Forever is a bit long. Remember that Bee Gees song from 'Saturday Night Fever'? You always thought they sang: "A sting in my life". I was five years old, what did I know? But they sang 'staying alive'. I'm telling you, these lockers are too small. How so? Eye to eye with optician van Laren? What's that for? Nothing. - Do you need glasses? - No. How many fingers? Five. Did you see anything from that movie? No, not really. Should've worn your glasses. She stood me up. See. I told you. What a bitch. For real. You can tune your instruments now. - Did you see my black pants? - They're in the laundry. And my jacket? I must wear black. Here. And a white shirt? You can wear one of mine. Perfect. Or this one. Finally you're taking after me. Looks gorgeous on you. There's our pianist. Or should I say composer? I want you to be punctual or call to cancel. And here you only play what's written on paper. Otherwise you can leave, understood? And a good day to you too. Your place is behind the piano. Or do you want to give up already? Good. Eva, play a route note for Anouk. Stop. You. Are you joining us or not? From the top. With feeling, please. Again. Route note. Yes, well done. And now at the right moment. You have a great voice. Thanks. That conductor, what an awful man. Don't mind Felix. His mouth is as big as his heart. That last piece is boring. I also played it at my audition. - It got us to the fourth place. - Where? In Prague, at a competition for new compositions. We enter every summer. Can I also compose something? Or am I too young? No, not too young. There are different categories. But you'll have to write something better. - Bye. - Bye. No way I'm buying a scooter. - What are you doing? - I make it look convincing. Fried rice for table fifteen to compensate for the long wait. Casper, concentrate. Money doesn't grow on trees. - Sorry. - I'm taking this out of your tips. What's bothering you man? My dad. I thought you didn't have one. Of course I do. Everybody has a father, Pim. What's his name? Bob. Van Laren. Van Laren? Like that optician? - I'm not going in. - Of course you are. He might as well be an old man. What do you call two fighting pensioners? What do I say to him? The 80 Years War. No? Can I help you? He needs glasses. Near or far sighted? - What line can you still read? - The second. Read that line out loud. A, J, C... Is that an E or a C? And three times an O, that can't be right. - Does it fit? - Yes. Now you should see sharp. Robert van Laren. Can you read that? Bob. Nice photos. My son took them. He drifts around the world taking photos. Normally he takes horrifying war photos. Do you have grand children? Sorry, we have to go. We're already late. We'll be back to pick a frame. Those are my grandparents. It's pointless if you don't ask more questions. I'll call them later. Sure. I met my grandparents. At their store. They told me he's a photographer, not a drifter. - I want to meet him. - You can't. Why not? Believe me, it's best for you. Casper speaking. Mom, it's the hospital. I'm scheduled at 9 am so it won't waste my entire day. A pity you didn't discover this hotel sooner. Shall we visit India this summer? Why so far? I imagine it's a beautiful country. And our week on Terschelling? We've been there so often. India on the other hand... is an entirely different world. The orchestra is going to Prague. To enter a competition. But I'll cancel that if you want. No, of course not. When you play in Prague, I'll be in the front row. - Promise? - Promise. Are you sure you don't mind being alone tonight? Hurry sweetie. Mom. Exposition - Dark Shadow Robert? Hi aunt Hennie. Hi, good to see you. She's been awake, the doctor spoke to her. How did it go? Surgery went well. But they won't take any chances. Hi. Are you alright? What's wrong? Is it your mom? How do you know? I was at the hospital. I've been there plenty of times. My dad had it too. And your dad, he's...? Cured. She needs chemo. I think they're starting. Are you coming? Some people always manage to attract attention. Welcome home I think that went well. How do you know my number? I have everybody's number. - I know where my dad is. - That's great. Why don't I dare to approach him? That's not strange. Why don't you walk up to him and tell him "here I am"? And what if he doesn't want me? Just dive in and see. No, first I want to learn what he's like. How? So you do all the talking, agreed? Don't say my name and don't mention children. No problem. Show your interest, ask him about his photos. Can I ask him about his morbid curiosity? Sure, just leave me out of it. - You don't exist. - Exactly. Is this it? That's your mom. She looks pretty in this picture. - What's with your face? - That's not me Pim. The students you have an appointment with are here. Is that him? So you're writing a paper? - This is Robert. - Hi. I'm Pim, I'm doing the interview. And this is... I'm just handling the camera. It's out of focus. Allow me. It's this one. Perhaps you need glasses. I know a good optician. Do you know what you want to be? I want to have my own restaurant. Okay. And you? - Cameraman. - Composer. Cameraman. Whatever it is, just follow your heart. Before you know it you're dancing to someone else's tune. You're drifting all over the world. Is there a place you call home? I prefer to travel. I get restless when I stay longer. Like what? Like what? What is that makes you restless? Focus. Living in a house, no matter where... ...makes me feel like a bird in a cage. And what's the essence of a bird? To fly. When I don't travel I quickly lose my essence. So no woman and child for you? Women yes, but children... I've seen a lot of misery. Parents losing their children and vice versa. It touches me, so I take their photo... but I'd rather not feel their pain. I'd be a terrible father, no child deserves that. Concentrate or you'll never be a good cameraman. What's with him? His mother is sick. She's here, on one of your pictures. What's his name? Mom, are you alright? Thanks. Can I have two? What are these? Painkillers. Did you have a nice day? Yes. Sa?d and I had a fight. He thinks you're in love with me. Which is ridiculous, you're a good friend. My dad wants to invite you for dinner on Saturday. Why? Please Casper, please. Yes? Casper, Pim gave me your number. I'm Robert van Laren. - Are you there? - Yes I'm still here. Pim told me who you are and now... And now? I'd like to meet you. Okay. Saturday at three pm, in the train station restaurant? Do you know where that is? Yes, no problem. Okay, see you there at three. - Who was that? - Pim. - Where are you going? - I need some groceries. Let me get them. I'm looking for healthy food. Where are you? I'm coming. See, this is healthy. - Eggplant. - And this? Tricolor paprika. This is also healthy, isn't it? Come. How do you know these things? My dad saw a holistic doctor. A change of diet helped him. - Can my mother see him too? - Sure. But there is a long waiting list. Don't forget to wash it. Shouldn't I remove them all? - I didn't see it. - You didn't? Mince or dice? No, slice. How nice of you to cook for me. Thanks to Anouk. I have to take this. Hi Wouter. Did we have a date? She knows this holistic doctor... Cas, that's not for me. All they want is your money. - You have an insurance. - They won't cover it. All they do is take advantage of desperate people. You're a lawyer, you do the same. That's completely different. There's no need to yell. I'll be right there. My boyfriend called. I forgot we had a date. Would you mind if I...? What a pity. Thanks for the lovely meal. Suddenly you lost your appetite. I've seen a lot of misery. Parents losing their children and vice versa. It touches me, so I take their photo... but I'd rather not feel their pain. I'd be a terrible father, no child deserves that. Sorry to keep you waiting. Something came up. That's alright. You're here now. I had no idea when you and that friend of yours- Pim. ...came filming, that you were my son. I went to the optician. Do they even know I exist? Yes. But I never told them who your mother was. Out of respect for her decision. She wanted to raise you alone. How is she? She's okay. And you, Casper? Me? I'm still in school. You should go if you have to. Yes, I have a train to catch. Dad. You take great photos. My girls couldn't care less about all this. So I'm glad to have a guy around the house now. Who knows, you could be my future son-in-law. I'm happy you bought her a ring. A ring? It makes it all look a lot more serious. But tell me, what did you pay for it? 30 euro. I knew it. Sofie shouldn't lie. I didn't tell her what I paid. It's better if a girl doesn't know. Yeah, you're right. I don't tell everything either. They don't have to know I might lose my job. - Don't they? - No. I have to protect my girls against this unfair society. I had a conflict at my job and my boss takes the side... of a few Moroccans that complain about me. They want me to apologize. So I hired your mother to be my lawyer. But I'm a bit worried she might not make it till the end. End of what? Of my case, of course. Downstairs alarm. Let's eat. How was it at Sofie's? It was fun. - That's a nice headscarf. - Yes, I thought so too. Look what I have for you. An appointment with that doctor. Is nobody picking you up? We broke up. I'm sorry. Wouter confessed he kissed another girl. That's not a smart move. To confess? No, to kiss another girl. And you? Are you seeing someone? Me? No. Girls prefer to see me as their friend. That's just what you think. I'm pretty sure. I could like you. To talk with? No. I've been meaning to do this for a while. Hey, isn't Sofie with you? No she's with my mom. No, I rang her and she said she's not there. I don't know then. She said she'd see you. Who is Sofie? - His daughter. - His girlfriend. We just rehearsed, we play in the orchestra. Yes, this doesn't mean anything. It's not what you think it is. I'm not easily surprised. Come, Fyra. Tell your girlfriend I said hi. Where's the fire? - You need to see Sofie? - No, I'm here to see you. I want you to know that I have no feelings for Sofie. If I ever had any I'm cured. - Cured? - Yes, cured. Her dad saw me in the park with another girl. I'm fed up with her charade. Enjoy your evening. Chef? Can I have an advance on my pay? No such thing as a free lunch. What's in it for me? I can work more often and pay you back quicker. Won't it get you in trouble? Everything is under control. When a body experiences stress... cells close up and medicines can't reach them. I believe I can help your mother... if she's prepared to work on her stress and change her diet. Not everybody is willing to do that. My mom is willing to do anything. How can you be so sure? She doesn't want to die. Nobody does. That gets you a few consultations but I'm not sure if it's enough. I can get more. I won't accept cash, you need to transfer it. I can make a deposit. You're here because Anouk sent you. Her dad is a dear patient of mine. A few years ago he was given up, now he's making music again. So he's also a musician? Anouk said you knew him. Felix, the orchestra conductor. Felix is Anouk's dad. Who cares about Anouk, you got bigger problems. Here. What I'm I supposed to do with these? Smoke them. My mother is quitting. Very wise. Ah, now I get it. Anouk is the new Sofie? Hallelujah, here we go again. Have you seen my cigarettes? I could swear I had some. Let's go, I got a table at seven. Yes, I'm coming. How elegant. Gorgeous. I'll have number 35. And I'll have number 11, but less spicy. Nice and destressing, isn't it? As if we're really in India. I doubted between this and a Czech restaurant. We'll make it to Prague. You've already been to India. Did Bob tell you that? I saw the film on your computer. You didn't tell me. No. And neither did you. I saw a photo at the exhibition. Of you in India, six months before I was born. Do you want to tell me about it? What do you want to know? Did you ever really love Robert? You saw him, what do you think? Mom. I thought he was a very nice guy. I never travelled before and he saw the whole world. With him things were an adventure. Until I discovered... He is quite fleeting. Did he hurt you? He gave me the best thing I could ever wish for. Robert said you wanted to raise me on your own. Did you never have doubts? Things go as they do. Shit. What's the matter? Sofie's dad. I don't like that man at all. Me neither. Did you break up with Sofie? We never even dated. She pretended because she is dating a Moroccan guy. Sofie is dating a Moroccan? Don't you start too. She should've opposed him. You have no idea what he's like. All too well. Too stubborn to apologize. Very destressing, this. We must go. - Hi Henk. - Hey, Marit. - Are you alone? - No. I'm here with my son. I don't want to see him. Why not? Sofie is devastated since he broke up. Casper didn't break up. They never had anything. Sofie should have told you she has a Moroccan boyfriend. It's going on for months. I like the idea of you having a Moroccan son-in-law. Nothing beats fat food. That's what stresses me out. Why? Don't you like it? I have something for you. What is it? First promise me you'll do it. I'll do anything for you. Promise? Yes, I promise. What does this cost? It's a friendly turn. Now I have a sting in my life. Staying alive mom. Those are the lyrics. Turn left A bit more. What is this? And stop. This is beautiful. If you can't come to India, India will come to you. It's so beautiful. When the test results are bad... I want you to take care of Casper. No smoking break. I have an important rehearsal. I'll be back in two hours. If you leave you never have to come back. And I want my money back. Everybody's here. Except Casper, but he'll be here any minute. Or he won't. Did he call to cancel? He didn't. I'd like to talk to you about our trip to Prague. We're almost ready to go- A ticket to Prague. Did you get a cancellation insurance? Why? Are you intending to get sick? No, but the orchestra goes by bus. Or you'll travel alone. I'm going to Prague. If it's the last thing I'll do. Your mom got the results. Mom. What will I do without you? Mom. Thank you. What do you want? A smoke? I quit. Your aunt is looking for you. I refuse to stand there shaking hands. I used to be scared of cows. But not anymore. What are you trying to say? When are you moving? No way I'm moving in with my aunt. Where then? With your dad? The homeless tramp. He has a home. How do you know? He gave me his card. Anouk. I was looking for you. I want to share my sympathy. I asked my dad to let the orchestra play here. But he said no. He said he couldn't cope with it. Should I say thanks for something that didn't happen? No. I'll see you around some time. Are you ignoring her enough? Couldn't this wait one more day? Your mom already cancelled the rent. No, no. I'm safe. Don't worry. Here. Having a fight with your mom? I ran away. And now you're looking for photos. I'm looking for answers. I know enough. Because I found these. You didn't even bother to open her letters... let alone read them. You're so concerned about the world's issues... but you're really just shallow. You don't care about people. My mother warned me. You're worse than I thought. Meanwhile I thought she tried to keep us apart. But that wasn't the case. You don't deserve to be loved. That's what I want to tell you. I love my mom, not you. So you finally figured that out. You don't need me, you need her. Yes, I figured that out. Come. I'll take you home. You can't. Why not? Because... She's gone. She died. Do you ever travel? I was supposed to go to Prague. But I'm not going. Would you go there with your mom? With the orchestra I play in. So you play an instrument? Piano. I wanted to compose something but it failed. Failed? It's not good enough. A famous war photographer said: If your pictures aren't good enough, you're not close enough. I know nothing about it but perhaps that also applies to composing. This is all I have of your mother. Our story. I had to travel for a job. When I returned she told me she was pregnant. That she decided to keep you and to raise you alone. I didn't like that but women can decide such things. We men can then decide to distance ourselves from it. Where are you going? I'm off to see my parents, then I'm taking the plane. You're going on a trip? Where? Where there's sorrow. What about me? You have to make up your own mind. I have no say in it. Failed. Not close enough. We're staying here. Leave for Prague. Why are you here? I'm coming with you. You'll understand we found a replacement. My parents have houses in New York, Portugal and Milan. I finished my piece. That's too bad, you're too late. Sorry I missed the rehearsals. You're going through a rough time, I know. But that's no excuse to come and go as you please. Anouk, we have to talk. We have to talk. Indian Summer - For My Mother It's interesting, but you know it from pictures already. Where are you? I want to see you. Church. Also boring. On the Charles Bridge. Sir, can you go to the Charles Bridge? This bridge is boring. Everybody sees it. Some tourist drown. Theyre stupid to jump of bridge. Dancing House. Ugly House. I can show you really nice houses. Do you like to travel? No but my father does. Faster, please. From here you have to walk. You can keep the change. Casper. Are you alright? I had to talk to you. And so you came all the way to Prague. Yeah. I'm sorry I was such a jerk. That kiss... That was a mistake. No. That wasn't a mistake. I really like you a lot. Sofie has been dating Sa?d for a long time. But her father doesn't like it. So she pretends she's dating me. It's a bit complicated. I'm also sorry I said bad things about your dad. I should have told you he's my dad. Why didn't you? Because I liked you. Liked? Like. So I didn't come here for nothing. Come. Maestro. Can you make place for Casper? He's playing his own piece.
