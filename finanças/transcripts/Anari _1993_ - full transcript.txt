Listen to everybody! All the villagers are hereby invited for the lunch.. ..in Thakur's mansion to celebrate.. ..the birthh of a baby girl in his clan after many years. After many days a girl has been born in Thakur family. No, exactly after three generations.. ..a daughter is born in his family. Our darling sister Rajnandini has completed one year today. We can't take your place in her life. But l promise you, she'll never lack anything in her life. Bless her on her first birthhday and give us the strength. Hey! Wait! No pushing and running around. Come in a queue. Everybody will get a gift from Bhairaja. Hariya, done? -Yes, Bhairaja. l hope nobody is left now. -No, Bhairaja. Now go and call Rama. -Why? Of course, for singing. His father used to sing in my father's time. Now Rama will take his place in our time. Go and call him now. -He won't come, Bhairaja. Why? -l had been that side in the morning. His mother took him to the school for his admission. Rama will take education? He doesn't even know the difference.. ..between a horse and mare. He's a dumb fellow. No, sir. My son is not dumb. He was born before time. That's it. Other than that he lack in nothing. He's very innocent. He values everything by one standard. You please give him admission. l can understand your worries, Rama's mother. But, how can l make him sit with these kids? When Rama's father was alive.. ..several times l told him to get Rama admitted in school. But he was adamant that education.. ..would not satisfy your hunger. So he just taught him singing. Even the labours don't earn satisfactorily by toiling hard.. ..how will he earn it from singing? Rama! Rama! C'mon, Bhairaja has called you. l? -Yes. lt's Rajnandini's birthhday today. So he called you for singing. -Singing? -Yes. C'mon, let's go. -C'mon. Look, Savitri, if you wish, l'll include Rama in the list.. ..of the boys, who receive daily meal from the mansion.. No, Sir. By the grace of God, l've enough to meet our needs. l came to you with a hope that Rama would learn something.. ..and would independently differentiate.. ..between right and wrong. But it's not your fault. lt's my misforthunate. Bye! l had left Rama here! Rama! He had got a call from Mansion. He has gone to sing there. Today its Bhairaja's sister Rajnandini's birthhday. My husband left me crying in his passion for singing. Now a son is making my cry for the same passion. A little cute and charming fairy has come down to the earthh. A little cute and charming fairy has come down to the earthh. An innocent, unique little fairy has come down. May she always keep rocking in the cradle! May she always sway in happiness.. ..like a melody of music. This world appears as described in Rama's song. l don't know about any rhythm or tunes. Wonder how became a singer! Ever since l've born.. l have bonding. ..l've become friends of everyone l loved. God has gifted me everything. l just sang that clicked my mind. l just sang that clicked my mind. ..like a melody of music. This world appears as described in Rama's song. This is a parrot and this is it's cage. This month, we've profited Rs50000 from the garden at Amroli. This is a parrot and this is it's cage. This month, we've profited Rs50000 from the garden at Amroli. Last month? -lt was Rs25000. That means the profit doubled. Elder brother, Shashtriji has come. Come, Shashtriji! We were waiting for you. -Bless you! May you always prosper! May you always gain success! Shashtriji, Rajnandini has completed 5 years. Now l want to send her to the school. You said you'd forecast Rajnandini's future.. ..only when she'll step in her sixth year. That's why l had called you. l guessed that upon receiving your message. Rajnandini is very lucky. She's very lucky for this mansion. Your name, fame and wealth would double.. ..by her arrival in your life. Yes! And with time, your love for her will.. ..always increase and it'll be the same in her case. lt'll never reduce. But.. -But, what Shashtriji? There's a confusion about her marriage. Confusion? About marriage?! Yes! She'll marry against your will. Shashtriji, what nonsense is this? lt's not nonsense, Junior Raja. l'm predicting the future. -Brother! This astrology is nonsense. lt's a blind faith. Bhairaja! lt was my prediction that a girl will take birthh.. ..in this family after three generation and it came true. And it was my prediction.. ..that you'll lose your parents at the age of 12. And it happened. And now what l have said will also come true. What? Nothing will happen. You just leave. -Junior Raja. l said what l could see. Now it's up to you whether you want to believe it or not. May god bless you! Bhairaja! A car is ready to take Rajnandini to school. Rajnandini will not go to school. -Brother?! Yes! School will come here for Rajnandini. And since then the mansion was her only school.. ..and temple and everything. Even the friends were called to the mansion to play with her. A check post was built at the gate. And no stranger man was allowed to enter. Only twice or thrice she used to get a chance.. ..to go out of the mansion. But even then a man with a red umbrella used to leave.. ..the mansion on his bicycle before her. So that everybody would come to know.. ..that Rajnandini is coming out of the mansion. Seeing an umbrella, all the men used to hide. Because it was Bhairaja's order.. ..that no stranger would see Rajnandini. And if anybody would see her or say anything about Rajnandini.. ..then his punishment was fixed. And these unforthunate men committed the same mistake. He's the youngest of Rajnandini's three brothers. Chhote Raja. He's experth in giving such punishments. Aye! Quick! Quick! lf you leave a single hair, l'll kill you. How long will this continue, Chhote Raja? Aye, till Rajnandini gets married. He's the younger brother of the three. Manjale Raja and his wife Sudha. And he's the eldest brother Bhairaja. His order is God's order for both the brothers. But his sister Nandini is his life. She's Nandini's eldest sister-in-law, Manjula. She has brought up Nandini like a mother. And this is the princess' room. Today Rajnandini has completed 16 years. Savitri! Savitri! Where are you? Come out! What's the matter? How come all of you are together? People are right. You never know anything.. ..about what's happening in the village and where. Today is the 16th birthhday of Bhairaja's sister. Understand. Oh, really? Bhairaja has invited all the villagers for lunch.. ..and not to cook anything at home. C'mon, let's go. You know that l never attend any auspicious celebrations. You're very suspicious, Savitri. Nobody believes all this about widows you know. Nobody would follow such strict rules like you. Why do you compare my misforthune with others? You please go. Okay, let's go. -Yes, let's go. C'mon. Hurry up! Let's go quickly! Otherwise, food will finish. Food will finish! Hurry up! See, there's a man coming in. Who let him in? He's Raghu, a cook in this mansion. Hey, old lady. Why are you blocking my way? Hey, who did you call old? -You. You called me old? Do l look old? -My heroine. You look like a teenage girl. 16 years young lady. l've become 60 now. Please give me way. l've got grandchildren. -Go! Go! You old hag! Rama! Rama! Rama! l know.. ..he must have gone to the mansion. Where all the men are restricted to go.. ..they allow him because.. ..they think he's totally unaware of the worldly norms. He's uneducated, ignorant, and innocent. Several times l warned him not to go there.. ..but he doesn't listen to me. Rama! Sing a song for Nandini's birthhday. On your flowery face, is seen a smile like buds. On your flowery face, is seen a smile like buds. Nature is amazed to see your beauty. Nature is amazed to see your beauty. On your flowery face, is seen a smile like buds.

But it's not their fault. These hands are guilty.. ..that cooked such tasty food. Today l'll cut these hands off. Bablu! -Yes, boss. Bring the knife. Yes, boss, tell me where shall l cut off? -From here. -Okay. ldiot! You want to grab my position.. ..by cutting off my hand? Now c'mon, pass me the ingredients. -Okay, tell me. That's good. -Go ahead. -Give me oil. -Oil. Onion! -Okay! Chili! -Here. Ladle. -La.. Hurry up! ldiot! You gave burn injuries on my hand. Now l'll teach you a lesson. -Hey.. Let me hide into this.

Everything is useless without marriage. l'm ready now. -Leave my hand. Turn your face here. -Get lost! What are you doing, darling? First you marry me. l'll make your life like a heaven. Give me a kiss in advance. No way. l'm going to wash clothes. l won't let you go. Give it to me first. No l won't. -l want it. -You won't get it. l'll be displeased with you. -As you wish. What are you doing? -Scraping up. You can't do that before marriage. Wonder when l'll get married and relived from this itching. What did you do? Why did you hit me? Then why did you scrape up? Can't l scrape up mine? You can. But can't scrape up mine. Okay, yours. But when did l scrape up yours? Great! You scraped me up twice. Twice? -Yes. l've tried so many times in life. But haven't succeeded even once. Lyin.. -l'm not lying. Why are you dancing? What happened? An insect has gone in my skirth. lnsect.. lnsect? lnsect? Remove.. Remove.. -What are you doing? You just remove the skirth. l'll kill that insect right away. Remove.. remove it. -What if somebody will see? Nobody is here except the two of us. C'mon, remove it. -What if somebody will come? Nobody will come. You just remove it. Nobody will come. who else are here? Only you and l and she. Only three of us are there. ls anybody there? -No.. nobody. Nobody. -You.. You were scratching up and l was getting rebuked. ldiot! Hit him! Just a minute! Just a minute! Just a minute! Did you find the cockroach? You just remove it. Remove it.. Remove.. Why you had to come home? You should have stayed there. l know. You love the food prepared in the mansion, right? What is this, mother? What are you saying? You think l had gone there to eat? l didn't even have a glass of water since morning. Have l ever eaten food prepared by anyone except you? You know people were praising my song over there. They said, he sings like a radio. And not only over there.. ..people praise my song everywhere. But you never come to listen to it. Mother, why don't you come here? lt won't suit for me to go to such places. -Why? You can't understand even if l tell you. What do you mean? You always say that l don't understand this and that. You'll make me dumb in this way. Let go of. For now, l'm starving to death. Please feed me something. You've grown up so big and you still want me to feed you? Help yourself and eat. l won't feed you. What did you say? You won't feed me? Fine. l know how to make you feed me. Hurry up! All the women ran to the mansion for food. Did you all think about the men? At least you should have thought about this child. He's crying since so long. l had thought of returning early. But got late. What could l do? Look, Rama starthed singing. Now all the kids will not recall their hunger. A little cute and charming fairy has come down to the earthh. A little cute and charming fairy has come down to the earthh.

Govind! -Yes. -My friends have come. Bring some breakfast. -Right away. We'll go out and play. That'll be fun. Outside? No way. -Why? l had told you she can't come out. Her world is restricted in these walls. Nandini, if you don't mind, shall l say something to you? What? Don't you feel restless being caged in the house? Look at us. We too are girls. We too live with all the restrictions. But still, we go out and play. We bathe in the streams. And rock in the garden. We don't stay at home like a prisoner. Look, if you don't like then don' t come. But when l'm getting all the comforths at home.. ..why should l go out? l was just joking. Sorry. Get over your anger, Nandini. Let's play. C'mon Load the luggage in car. What's the matter? Where are you heading to? l'm taking away your sister to the temple. Why? l've got a temple built in the mansion. Then which temple are you taking her? To our family temple. l had vowed to offer coconuts to save Nandini from evil eyes. lt's good for human being to go to God. Not the God to come to him. So you too have a tongue, right? l need to keep quiet in presence of others. But l can speak in privacy, can't l? Oh, really? -Yes. Rajnandini's carth is coming. All the men go back to your house. All the men go back to your house. C'mon, hurry up. Run, Rajnandini's carth is coming. Run! What happened? Rajnandini has come to the temple. Rajnandini? -Let's go, Rama. -Why, mother? l'll tell you later. Let's go. Come, let's go in. Shiva, take the stool inside. Dinesh! Dinesh! Why are you offering the coconuts there? lt can harm any passerby. Come inside and offer it. Hey, let it hit anybody. We're Bhairaja's men. Mother! Mother! Mother! Blood! Rama! Rama! Rama! Rama! Rama! Rama! Listen to me. -No, mother. Stop, Rama. -l won't spare him, Mother. No, Rama. -No, mother. l'll kill him. Hey, stop! Hit him more! Rama! Rama! Rama! Rama! By swear of me. -No, mother. -No. Let's go. Till date you've never spoken ill about anybody.. ..or raised finger at anybody. How come you suddenly became so wild? From where did you learn all this? You're asking me? What was the first word you said when it hit you? Mother! Didn't you? And it had hit my mother. Then how would l have felt? Had you not stopped me. l'd have chop him to pieces. See.. come and check it yourself. My blood is still boiling recalling that incidence. l feel fire in my body. Feel fire in your body? lf anybody would dare look at that girl.. ..Bhairaja breaks his bones. And if anybody would smile at her.. ..he gets his half moustache and half head shaved. And you.. you skirmished with them? Now l'm worried about how Bhairaja will treat you. He knows me well. He won't do anything to me. Rama, Bhairaja has called you now. C'mon. -Brother, don't harm him. He's innocent. Till date my men have beaten the villagers.. ..but nobody raised hands at my men. You're the first person. Answer me. -What do l say, Bhairaja? What would you have done if it would have hit your sister? l'd have chopped him to pieces. -Exactly. When you can do so much for your sister.. ..think how l'd have felt seeing my mother injured. That's why l beat him up. Why are you staring at me, Bhairaja? Will you hit me? Fine, go ahead. You're rich people. lf this is justice in your eyes then you can do so. But hit on my back. Don't hit on my face. lf my mother would see my wounds.. ..she won't be able to tolerate it. She'll cry to her death. She's a weak hearthed person, you see. l didn't call you here for beating. What? Will you really not beat me? -No. God, you saved me. l'm feeding them so much to guard Nandini. But you alone have beat them up in a moment. Well done! Henceforthh, you're Rajnandini's bodyguard. Cleaning up Nandini's room.. ..and providing her everything that she needs.. ..will be your responsibility. Wherever she'd go, you'll follow her like a shadow. And if anybody would dare look at her.. ..you'd break his bones. Will you be able to do this? -Why not, sir? l'll definitely do it. Fine! Resume on the job from tomorrow. Hey, l've got a job in the mansion. l'll tell mother about it. What did you do, brother? You appointed that foolish guy as Nandini's bodyguard? Since he's foolish, l've made him a bodyguard. He's as powerful as several bulls.. ..but his brain is just like a child. Hey, you people will work in the field now. Go. Sister Savitri, even the God can't see injustice done.. ..in front of his temple. That's why God made them beaten by Rama. And He also arranged for his job in the mansion. Bhairaja! Bhairaja! -What's the matter? l've brought God's offering for getting a job in the mansion. Let me put a mark. -Go back to your work. Manjale Raja, you get the mark. -Go away. Chhote Raja, mark.. -Don't touch me. Move.. What kind of people are they? l'm giving them God's offering and they're making me move. Fine, if you don't like, it's okay. l'll put it to junior madam. Junior madam! Junior madam! Junior madam! Rogue! How dare you! You touched my sister? You put a mark.. Surendar! Let go of him! Look, Rama! l had clearly told you before appointing.. ..on a job, that if anybody would dare look at our sister.. ..you'll break his bones. And this order applies to you too, is that clear? lf you repeat this in future, l'll break your bones. l'm forgiving you since it was your first mistake. Go. Bablu, what are you doing? lt's a strange type of itching, Bijali. l had drank last night but haven't got it's effect yet. So, l'm standing upside down to get the effect. And what are you doing? l heavily drank last night and had a hangover till morning l'm trying to sober down now. ldiots! You people are really useless fellows. Look at poor Raghu. He works so hard. What hard work? Food is prepared on the stove. Can he do things with his open eyes.. ..that l can do with my eyes closed? No! What did you say? You can never do things with your open eyes.. ..that l can do with my eyes closed? Really? So tell me what's that thing? What's this? -Chili powder! Great, Bablu! -Can you do this with your eyes open? Yes, l can. Please get up. Then try doing it, boss. -Right away. Boss! You had promised me not to raise your hand. Yes, l had. But l'm using my leg to kick you. 1..2..3.. -Hey.. -What happened? My God! What a room! A princess had such room, in a movie l had seen once. Bed! lt's my bed. What are you doing? Do you spread the bed-sheet like this? Hold it. Open it. Not like that. Like this.. lt's done. Junior madam! -Yes. What's all this? -You apply it on a face. -Oh! That's why you look so beautiful. Shall l apply it? -Yes. Why are you laughing? We were playing in the garden and.. ..rocking on the swings and she fell down. We had a fun. Okay, what will we play today? Nandini! -Yes. What happened? -Nothing. That day you were talking about bathing in the river.. ..and dancing in the garden, right? From that day onwards, l too feel like doing the same. But how can l do it? Who will take me out? Can you help me? No way. lf your brothers would come to know they'll kill us. Hey.. what's this? l asked you whether l can apply it or not. -Yes. l applied it here. And it was very light here. So l applied some over here and it became little dark. Then l applied here. Then here. And finally it came out like this. lsn't it good? lt's very nice. l've also put a black mark to save myself from any evil eyes. You did that right, Rama. Before brother comes back.. Shall l show this to sisters-in-law? -Okay. Nandini, you were asking us about who can take you out, right? He can be of use. Trap him. Rama? -Yes, although he's innocent.. ..he's well aware of the surrounding area. Raghu! -Yes, Junior madam. Tell me what shall l bring for you. Tea, coffee, milk, chocolate milk or sweet curd? l want none of these. l want help. But l don't know how to cook it. -Can't you do me a favour? Favour? You mean help? -Yes. You should have said that before. Tell me, what shall l do for you? Take swear. -Okay. Now tell me what do you want me to do? lf sister-in-law would ask about me.. ..tell her that l've had my breakfast and lunch. Why? -l'm not going to come out of the room today. God! l smell something fishy. Look, junior madam. it's not in my hand. l mean not in my hand. Fine, l'll tell everything about you to the elder brother. About me? What? That you touched my hand and took swear. l'm dead. lf your brothers will come to know.. ..they'll cut my hands. Madam, l beg at you. No. lf l'll touch your legs they'll cut my legs. l'm stuck up from all the ways. So you won't help me, right? -Why not? l'll definitely help. lf l won't, then l'll become a handicap and sit outside.. ..a temple begging for alms. Lord of Shirdi, Saibaba.. Hey.. -Junior Madam! You?! Where were you till now? My brothers were waiting for you and they just left. Waiting for me? -Yes. -But why? They wanted you to take me out.. ..to some gardens and fields. -l see.. l'll go and get the car now. -No. l don't want any car. -No, car? Then we'll go by our car. Okay? Hold it. What an ambiance!

You've promised me. Rama's promise is final. l won't tell them. lt's a simple fever. She'll be fine. -Thank you. Why did you call so many doctors? Perhaps, your sister has caught cold.. ..because of being in water for a long time. l've given her medication. She'll be fine by the morning. Don't worry. Bye! But Nandini never went out of the room today. l had sent her breakfast and lunch in her room. Then how did she get wet? What do you do at home? You very well know how weak she's.

Bijlee send me to him to ask him.. ..when he's going to put this chain around her neck. But he isn't answering. ln fact he's escaping from me. Raghu, c'mon, answer me. l'm a goner. - Hey.. -Yes, sir. Come here. Hey.. You go inside. Raghu! Yes, sir. You know a young girl stays in this mansion. -Yes, sir. Such dramas shouldn't take place here. Yes, sir. And if it happened again.. -Yes, sir. l'll cut your hands. -Yes, sir. ls that clear? -There's noting to get confuse. lf my hands will cut off, how will l cook? l'll lose my job and will be forced to beg for alms. But how can l even beg? lf l'll lose hands, l'll beg with my legs. l had to listen to so much because of Raghu. He's so coward. He's scared about every little thing. Fine, if it's so importhant for you to put it on.. ..l'll put it around your neck. -Hey, what are you doing? You don't know about it's importhance. What are you saying? l don't know about this thread? l pierce noses of all the calves in the village. God! -l bring control over all the naughty bulls. Let me put it around your neck today. -No.. no.. Don't do that. -Why are you so sacred? Let me put it around your neck. -Hey.. -God! ldiot! lt's not the one you pierce in your cattle's nose. lt's for the neck. What? l know about one that's put in the nose. But what's this one? My dear friend. You don't need to know about all this. Whatever has happened till now was enough. Tomorrow, l'll prepare sweets for you. But for now you please leave. Really? By swear, go. Don't forget. Rice. -Yes. Go! Silly girl, did you chose this dimwit.. ..to send me a nuptial chain? lf he had a sister, he'd have known it's importhance.. ..and also about marriage. lf l had come little late.. ..a calamity would have occurred. No, this won't be done. Tomorrow itself we'll get married. -Really? Hey, you can't go in. -Chhote Raja had called us. Go and ask them. - Hey.. -Hello, Bhairaja! What's the matter? Tomorrow is my engagement. l had asked for some money from Chhote Raja.. ..and he had told me to come to the mansion. Fine, let him in. Hey, look up there. Don't look up. She's Bhairaja's sister. What a beauty! -Keep quiet. Don't speak loudly. These arrangements are made.. ..so that no man could see her. Don't look up. By swear. One would never satisfy looking at her all the time. God knows who.. -Rogue! You came to beg for money and talking about my sister? How dare you? Baldy! Did you see the outcome of not controlling your tongue? And unnecessarily l too got this punishment. A new unit is getting launched in the factory today. Do you know who's coming to inaugurate it? Bhairaja's sister. Rajnandini. Everybody is instructed. lf anybody would dare look at her, he won't be spared. After us, nobody will suffer like us. What do you mean? They made me baldy and cut my moustache. And my engagement was called off because of them. l won't spare them. What will you do? l'll kill their darling sister. Okay! Okay! Stop! Stop! Stop! Owner of the factory! Walk slowly. -Welcome! Welcome! Welcome! Welcome! Junior madam, welcome! First put your right leg. Come.. Ever since you've said that l'm very scared. l'm sweating a lot out of fear. After all, what have you done? l've changed both the connection of the main switch. Nandini will press the switch and there'll be a shorth circuit.. ..killing their darling sister with the electric shock. Rajnandini, we prosper with your auspicious arrival. Press the main switch on and starth our new unit. Hey! Catch him! Listen to me, Bhai! Listen to me for once. Listen to me. What's this? You starthed beating me up without knowing the reason? Do you know the reason.. -How dare you? You touched Nandini? You touched my sister! What are you watching here? Go away. Go! Nobody should be seen around. Go! Brother, don't hit him. Listen to me. Listen to me for once. But listen to me once. Don't hit me. Don't hit me, Chhote Raja. Listen to him, brother. Brother, don't hit him. Brother, Rama isn't like that. There must be some reason. Ask him. How dare he touch you! He has no right to stay alive! No! Brother! Brother! Stop, brother! Stop! -Nandini! No, Chhote Raja, don't kill me. l didn't touch her intentionally. What had happened, Rama? Your brothers had made two of the factory workers baldy.. ..and they wanted to kill you to avenge their insult. He had exchanged the wires of main switch. lf you had touched it, you'd be dead. lf you think touching switch was.. ..better than me touching you.. ..then you're free to go and touch it. Go and die. What's my concern? Mother! l had come to tell this truth.. ..and you starthed beating me. Rama! -Henceforthh, you all.. ..please don't show me your face nor will l show you mine. Good bye to you and your job. Rama! -No, sir. lt's enough. l had enough beating. Rama! -l'm going, elder sister-in-law. They've beaten me up sp harshly. Mother! Mother told me several times.. ..not to serve the people in mansion but l didn't listen to her. This is the punishment of it. l'm sorry, mother. Please forgive me. l'm sorry. Switch it on! -We made a mistake, sir. Forgive me this time. lt won't be repeated in future. lf anybody dare look at my sister l can't tolerate. You tried to kill her. Switch it on. -No, sir, no. l said switch it on. -No, sir. lf he survives, take him to the hospital. Otherwise, send his corpse to his house. Junior Madam, you?! Come! Tell me what's the matter? Forgive me, Rama. You suffered so much because of me. Why are you feeling sorry, madam? l'm not displeased with you. Really? You're not displeased with me? -No. Then will you come to the mansion tomorrow? Yes, of course. But your brothers beat up very cruelly.. ..without giving a thought. l caught you! l caught you! You want to get married secretly, right? l know. -Hey, mad. What are you blabbering? lf you'd seek elder's opinion, nobody would agree. But if you'll get married secretly.. ..everybody will have to accept you. Take this. Put it around her neck and get married. What? Putting this around somebody's neck means you're married to her? Mad fellow! Fool! Do you know the meaning of marriage? Band party, clarinet and food means marriage. l'll give you a tight slap and you'll come to senses. Go away. Mad! Take this away. You're afraid of getting beaten up by my brothers, right? Yes! -lf they won't beat you up, will you come? -Yes. lf you want them not to beat you up.. ..then put this around my neck. Tie three knots for three brothers. Their hands too will get tied. What? your brothers won't beat me up.. ..if l tie this into your neck? Never! They won't tolerate anybody else beating you up. That's really great. C'mon, l'll tie it now. This one for Bhairaja. This one for Manjale Raja and this one for Chhote Raja. Fine, l'll leave now. Otherwise, mother would be worried. Okay? God. With your blessing l got a sweet wife. And this sweet marth with mercy of His Excellency. God, today help me get good business. And empty this shop by evening. l'll empty it.

So today l'll eat with him. And as long as he's in this mansion.. ..he'll eat with us. Why are you standing? Sit. No, brother. My mother always feeds me. Really? First eat with us.

And look, the place where we're going.. ..don't call me aunt there. -So? Call me sister. Old lady, should l call you sister? l'll hit you. Why sister? Rama will call you younger sister. That's fine. -Shameless. Let's go. My younger sister. -Leave.. -Rama. Junior madam. Madam. What is it, Harya? Rama won't come to work today. Why? They're taking him to other village to select a girl. God knows who will marry this simpleton. Greetings. Come. Sit. Greetings. l'm girl's mother. Greetings. l'm girl's mother. l mean, father. Sit. You too sit. My wife.. she'll come. Please. Mother, you said we're going to a relative. Who is he? Girl's father. We've come to select a girl for you. -Marriage? l don't want to marry. l'm going. Rama. Don't do that. Sit properly. What? What is the groom saying? Nothing. He's feeling shy. All boys smoke these days. lt's not wrong. God. Mother, he seems to be deaf. So what? We care for the girl. l don't mind. lt's fashion to drink liquor these days. l too drink without telling my wife. You've come. l was inside. l said talk to them. Did he? Yes. But he can't hear what we say. Son? No. We've only daughter. Mother, she too is deaf. -Quiet. What? Boy wants to see the girl. She'll come soon. Mother. Why did you bring me here? What sin did l do? Rama. Look at the girl. Rama. Look. No.. Look. -No. You can talk.. Sing a song. My hearth beats fast. l get scared. My hearth beats fast. l get scared. Where is Rama today? -He.. ..went to see a girl. l heard if he had been told, he would've fled. So his mother took him without telling him. Sister-in-law. The goat's kid was drinking milk. l tied him. Now l'll see.. l heard you went to select a girl. Did you like anyone? How can l say that? Her father and mother were deaf. l told her to sing and she opened her mouth. l ran so fast that l stopped at home. Now my mother won't dare to take me for bride selection. l've given my hearth to you, dear. l've given my hearth to you, dear. l am crazy for you. l am crazy for you. l've given my hearth to you, dear. l've given my hearth to you, dear. l am crazy for you. l am crazy for you. l miss you all night. l pray that we don't separate. l miss you all night. l pray that we don't separate. l dream only of you. Touch me, you're in my breath. Our saga has been made. l am crazy for you. l am crazy for you. l confess, l look at you all the time. l confess, l look at you all the time. Nobody knows this restlessness of love. l confess, l look at you all the time. Nobody knows this restlessness of love. Now my craziness doesn't heed me. Our love story will never end. l am crazy for you. l am crazy for you. l've given my hearth to you, dear. l've given my hearth to you, dear. l am crazy for you. l am crazy for you. Hey, what's this, madam? You're eating in boss' plate. lsn't there clean plate in the house? -There is. But it's our custom.. ..that wife eats in her husband's plate. lt's a matter of pride for a wife. l didn't get it. lt's our custom.. ..that wife eats in her husband's plate. lt's a matter of pride for a wife. What's so importhant.. ..that you called the three of us? l want to talk about Nandini. Nandini? What happened to her? Nothing yet. But l fear something might happen. After all what is the matter? Tell me clearly. Nandini has become young now. lf it's wrong to let young girl roam in village freely.. ..then it's not right to tie her in the house too. Nandini is a nice girl so nothing happened yet. l think we shouldn't delay her marriage.. ..or else there will be a problem. And prince too said.. ..that he won't marry before Nandini. At least for him.. ..find a good groom for Nandini. Sister-in-law. lf you think we're not looking for a groom for Nandini.. ..you're mistaken. Yes, sister-in-law. Brother has selected a nice boy for Nandini. We're going to see him tomorrow. Really? We don't need to lie to you. You broke the glass again. Now don't stand here. Go. Where do they come from? Sister-in-law. What is it? Today Rama didn't come to work. He won't come today. He won't. Why? ls he not well? What is the matter, Nandini? l've been observing for days.. ..you care a lot for Rama. Look, Nandini. Servants come and go. Masters shouldn't care too much for their servants. You're a woman. Rama is fine. He went out with your brothers. Brothers? Where? To select a groom for you. My husband.. ..went to find a groom for me. l told you earlier not to take this simpleton along. You didn't listen to me. Everything was ruined because of him. Why are you shouting at me, prince? That fool for our beautiful princess. Thank God this alliance break. Driver, pull over. Rama, get down. Why? First you. He's telling you to get down. Why, king? You won't get down. We're going to see the son of landlord of Jagannathpur. lf you come, you'll ruin things there too. Boss, l swear. l won't say a word. He, come. Take this. -Why? lf you know the way, return home. Or else drown in shame. Let's go. Boss. Listen. l won't say anything about the boy. l'm telling the truth. Don't leave me. Boss. Junior madam. Junior madam. Junior madam. You're here. Shouldn't l see the boy whom you're going to marry? So l went with your brother. You're princess. So your groom should be like a prince, right? But he was like a scarecrow. You're a golden fairy. He was like a cock. l told everyone this. -King slapped me. He left me midway and went to see another boy. l don't care for getting slapped. But l'm happy your alliance wasn't made with him. lsn't anyone home? Where is sister-in-law? Today is veneration for wives. They went to temple. What's this veneration about? Wives pray for long life of their husbands. Does it really makes the husband's life long? Yes. Look.. ..if my mother had prayed like this.. ..my father wouldn' t have died. Forget the past. Now think of future. My brother will bring the boy in front of me.. ..with whom they want me to marry. Before that l want to bring the boy.. ..whom l've married. Come with me. Where? For veneration. Why should l go there? Why did you bring me here? l wanted to explain you something. And tell the entire village. So l brought you here. That night mad Baiju gave the thread.. ..wasn't an ordinary thread, Rama. lt's thread of a woman's life. This isn't only a necklace.. ..but it's nuptial chain. That nuptial chain you tied to me with the moon as witness. l became your wife at that moment, Rama. So without understanding it.. ..you're looking for a wife for yourself.. ..and a husband for your wife too. No. No. No matter what others think now.. ..if my brothers even kill me anger.. ..l'm still your wife. And before they find another husband for me.. ..they should know that you're my husband. Come with me. -No. l'm not your husband. We didn't get married. Let me go. Rama. Rama. Stop. Stop. Listen to me, Rama. Stop, Rama. Rama. Mother. Mother. Mother. What is it? Mother, tell me the truth. How marriage takes place? What? How marriage takes place? -Yes. lt's not your fault. How would you know? l never took you to any wedding. Not that. Tell me.. ..marriage takes place only when clarinet is played. Yes. Marriage takes place only when drum is played. Yes.. ..marriage takes place only when there is feast. Yes. Hey, what is the matter? That Nandini doesn't know anything. She says if people put nuptial chain, people get married. Silly. Nandini is right. There can be marriage without clarinet. There can be marriage without drums. There can be marriage without feast. There can't be marriage without nuptial chain. lf a man.. ..put nuptial chain to a woman's neck.. ..then both of them become husband and wife. What will happen now? Mother. To escape beating from Nandini's brother.. ..l put nuptial chain around her neck. Am l married to her? What? You.. you've put nuptial chain around Nandini's neck. Yes. This.. what are you saying? What should l do? l didn't know. Nandini too didn't tell me. She's telling me now. Mother. Mother. Mother. Mother. Mother. Mother. Mother. -Rama. Rama. Nandini.. ..did it on knowingly or unknowingly.. ..but you'll blamed. lf your nuptial chain.. ..is seen by her brothers. Should l take it out? -No. You won't go there. lf you go there, you won't return alive. They'll kill you. -What are you doing? Why will they kill me? Nandini told me to do this. Rama, how should l explain to you? Wait. Rama. You love me very much. -Yes. You listen to me. -Yes. Then.. ..listen. Before her brothers find out.. ..you leave this village. Mother. Yes. You too come. We'll leave. -No. l can't go. lf l leave.. ..villagers will say both sinned and fled. Look, until l don't say.. ..don't return from aunt Shanta's house. Mother, you.. lt won't be for too long. Only till Nandini gets married. Then l'll bring you back. But mother, l can't leave you alone. Nothing will happen to me. Nothing will happen to me. Go. Mother. You take sorrow and give joy. So priceless is maternal love. She sings and showers happiness. There is nothing like mother. l will worship you all my life, O' mother. My life is for you, O' mother. My life is for you, O' mother. Rama. Come here. Hey. l'm calling you. Brother is calling you. Come. Come. Where are you going so late in the night? Mother told to leave the village before you return.. Where are you going so late in the night? Mother told to leave the village before you return.. What? Nothing. Get in the car. Why? l said get in. Get in. lf your brothers find out.. ..they'll first kill us.. ..then bury you two alive. That day Bijlee sent nuptial chain through Rama. l understood that day that Rama is so innocent. He doesn't know anything about nuptial chain. How did you make him agree to put nuptial chain? Sister, it seems they're back. Nandini. Nandini. Child Nandini. l've selected a good groom for you. You want to know how your groom is. Surender. Bring him in. l've selected a good groom for you. l've told Rama how the boy is. Now Rama will sing to you. Hey, sing, Rama. Clipping the wings of bird.. ..you say.. ..show us how you fly. After cutting the tongue, this world.. ..says sing for you. Rama. What did l tell you to sing and what are you singing? Brother.. He's talking about himself. Let him sing. This hearth is so helpless as it can't even cry. This hearth is so helpless as it can't even cry. Who will tell us what God wishes? This hearth is so helpless as it can't even cry. Who will tell us what God wishes? This hearth is so helpless as it can't even cry. Under your shelter, you gave me a boon. l learnt what my mother taught me. l am not a man to hurth anyone. l have faults too, but l'm not a traitor. l accepted everyone as my mine, this is my fault. This is my fault. This hearth is so helpless as it can't even cry. Who will tell us what God wishes? This hearth is so helpless as it can't even cry. l was innocent. l didn't know anything. l couldn't understand what the thread of customs mean. l did the crime, l don't refuse. l erred unknowingly, l'm not a culprit. l've understood now what vermillion means. What vermillion means. This hearth is so helpless as it can't even cry. Who will tell us what God wishes? This hearth is so helpless as it can't even cry. Who will tell us what God wishes? This hearth is so helpless as it can't even cry. Who will tell us what God wishes? This hearth is so helpless as it can't even cry. Rama! Rama! Scum! l won't spare you. l'll.. -Stop. Stop. -Leave me, sister-in-law. Run, Rama. Get aside, sister-in-law. -Leave her, Surinder. This isn't an ordinary thread to be broken. This sister nuptial chain. Nandini, go inside. You couldn't tolerate if a stranger.. ..used to look at your sister. But today your sister hugged him and kissed him. What will you do now? You'll cut her into pieces. This is because other your restrictions. lt's all your fault. Brother. Come. What's all this, child? Brother. You brought all the world home for me. School. Temple, friends. But you forgot.. ..that even a golden cage is a cage. l too wanted to roam like other girls. But for your sake.. ..l suppressed my feelings. ln this condition.. ..when nobody dared to even look at me.. ..Rama was the first man to talk to me without fear. After three brothers, Rama was the one to care for me. He touched me first time and put vermillion on my forehead. He staked his life to save me. He has no evil intention in his hearth. He's great. So l never thought.. ..that he's rich or poor. Educated or illiterate. So l decided to marry him. l made him put this nuptial chain. Now he's my life and existence. lf you harm him, remember.. -Stop. l know what you want to say. lf l harm him, you'll kill yourself. Right? l used to think that Rama is a fool. Worthhless. Stupid. l was wrong. Rama is great. ln a few days.. ..he made you forgot our 16 years of love.. ..can't be an ordinary man. Parents who give birthh.. ..brothers who raised.. ..are nothing in front of him. Nandini. Since your childhood, whatever you asked for.. ..l never refused. You want Rama. Right? Fine. Maybe he's hiding fearing us. We'll find him and get you married. Why are you staring me, Nandini? You think l don't know you're married. But with the man who doesn't know the difference.. ..between vermillion and color.. ..you can't get married to him just by tying nuptial chain. l'll get you married.. ..the way princess Nandini's marriage should take place. More grand that any other marriage in our area. That'll be your real marriage. Brother. Brother. Brother. Brother. Go. Go and sleep. Go. Go. Brother, are you mad? You'll hand our sister to that Rama. We've obeyed all your decisions. But we don't accept this. Then go.. ..and strangle her. You don't need weapon to kill her. Snatch her nuptial chain, she'll die. lf l too get emotional like you, what will happen? After three generations, a girl was born in our family. Our princess is like a brittle doll. lf we make haste, her life will be shattered. Her marriage.. ..wasn't a real marriage. But doll's wedding. And children think that wedding is real. lf we refuse, they create commotion. Our sister is in the same state. So we shouldn't snatch his nuptial chain. We should do something.. ..that she throws her nuptial chain. Find Rama. And kill him. And we'll convince Nandini.. ..that he committed suicide because of his crimes. After husband's death, nuptial chain is of no use to wife. She knows that well. We won't need to tell her. Yes.. lt's possible, she'll mourn for a year. We'll pretend to mourn too. And then we'll get her married. Listen. Nandini doesn't learn about it. lf she finds out, nothing will happen.. ..but l'll have to remarry. Greetings, mother-in-law of my sister. Why are you so scared? Ok, because l called you 'Samdhan' ( mother-in-law of daughter ). As per the custom.. ..l shouldn't call you that. But what can l do? l've raised Nandini as my daughter. So l said that. My son has erred. l accept it. You can give his punishment to me. Don't do anything to him. You.. you can kill me. l too was thinking the same, Savitri. But the problem is that.. ..mother-in-law's death can't remove nuptial.. ..chain of her daughter-in-law. Where is Rama? l don't know. Look.. ..l don't like to talk much. l give you two days time. lf you still don't tell me Rama's address.. ..you know.. ..what your state will be. Nandini. Look what's in it? Not just that.. ..but tonight on TV, we'll give news about Rama. When Rama is found, we'll get you married to him with pomp. Tell her. Yes, Nandini. Don't worry. Be happy. Come. First sweet then egg. Now tenant. And tomorrow you'll beg. Get lost. Guru. -What happened? What happened? -Wrestler's wife died. What should l do? My wife is alive. Get lost. Kallu wrestler's wife died so.. Kallu wrestler's wife.. Bablu. lnstead of harassing me.. ..go and earn respect like me. l know nothing except fighting. How can l earn respect? l'll tell you. Very simple. One days brother Sohan's mother died. l went to his house. He was crying. l went close to him. Brother Sohan, don't cry. This woman wasn't just your mother, but my mother too. His mother and his mother. She was mother of entire village. Then brother Sohan stopped crying. And everyone in village starthed respecting me. Do something like that. But nobody's mother died today. -So what? Kallu wrestler's wife died. l got it. l'll go to Kallu wrestler and console him and come. Go fast. You'll come when you're saved. My wife died. My wife died. Kallu wrestler, don't cry. She wasn't just your wife. She was my wife too. She was his wife. His wife too. She was wife of entire village. Hit him! Him him! -Run. You went there. You met my Rama. How is he? What can l say, sister? He's worried about you day and night. He's scared.. ..that atrocities might be done on you. He has stopped eating food too. l think they've come. Go. Quick. Savitri. You were given two days time. And that's ended. Tell us, where is Rama. l don't know. Brother, she won't speak so easily. Look, Savitri. Till today our family.. ..has never raised hands on woman. And l don't want this to happen. So l'm asking for the last time. Where is Rama? l don't know. You don't know. No. Stop. lf anyone moves.. ..or blinks.. ..then he'll die. Whatever happens here.. ..will be seen by all. Savitri. l know that even if l cut you to pieces.. ..you won't tell me Rama's address. Because you can shed your blood for your son.. ..you're such a generous mother. So.. the act to break your generous hearth.. ..will be done to you. Hey, bring him. The day you were widowed.. ..you had to wear white sari. Now it has become colorful again. There is a deep relationship between red color and woman. Shall l tell you? Woman wear red clothes on two occasions. First, during wedding. And secondly on nuptial bed. Hey, you're worried by this. There is more to come. A lot. Hey.. Colorful sari on a widow.. ..do you like it, Savitri? Black like the intention of devil.. ..who is insulting a woman who is like his mother. Disgusting like the intention of that scum.. ..who wants to punish my innocent Rama. You're not just insulting me.. ..but you're insulting motherhood. So l tell you.. ..don't force me to sin more. Tell me, where is Rama? All this can stop now. l kept saying.. ..l don't know. Now l say.. ..l know. But l won't tell you. Fine. l'll make you speak. lf you want nothing more to happen.. ..then give Rama's address. No. lf you ask again.. ..l won't say a word. Ok. Hey. Hey. Bring her groom. l'm getting married. Your mad son put nuptial chain in my sister's neck. So it's right for this mad to put nuptial chain to you. l'm getting married. Now he's your to-be husband. Hey, make her wear this. Yes.. lf you don't tell Rama's address now.. ..then you'll celebrate nuptial night here with this mad. No! Don't worry, Savitri. We're with you. Everything will be fine. No! Nandini. Stop it, Nandini. Stop it. Why have you come here? l used to think.. ..my sister-in-law is my mother. And my brothers are my father. l was made to believe.. ..that l'll be married to Rama. You've cheated me. lt must've been over. Everything must've been over. Those people must've killed my Rama by now. lt won't happen, Nandini. Listen to me. You still want me to believe you. You've deceived me. You're hearthless. Get out of here! Go. Listen to me, Nandini. No, Rama. We've fed you with these hands. Now we fold these hands to beg for our husband's lives. Honor us. No. These demons have to die who insulted my mother. l won't spare them. -Rama. Stop, Rama. No, Rama. No, mother. l won't spare them. -l say stop. By killing them.. ..you don't want to become a butcher. -No, mother. lf you want to call me mother again.. ..then leave. Drop this trident. So much has happened.. ..Rama, now we won't live here. Come. Come. The sister for which you did this injustice.. ..you'll lose that sister. Nandini has gone mad. She'll give up her life. Nandini. My beloved. My beloved. l plead to you, Lord. What's this separation! My beloved. Come, dear. l plead to you, Lord. What's this separation! My hearth says you dwell in it. My beloved. Come, dear. l bear all the pains for you. l will die for you. My hearth says, this life is yours. Whether anyone believes or not, you're mine. This isn't the bond to be broken. l've given my life to you. l can't live without you. My beloved. Come, dear. Nandini. -Nandini. What happened? -Nandini. -Open your eyes. Open your eyes. -Nandini. Open your eyes. Forgive us. The sin we did can't be pardoned. But.. a mother can forgive. lf we had a mother.. ..and we had got maternal love.. ..maybe we wouldn't have been like this. We want mother. You. Rama. Nandini is in the jaws of death. Now can l say, to save our sister. Go and save your wife. Yes. -Go, Rama. Beloved. Beloved. This world seems deserthed. The hearth beckons you. Beloved. Without you life is meaningless. This world seems deserthed. The hearth beckons you. You are my happiness. Beloved. Without you life is meaningless. How can my dreams be unfulfilled? l will even die for you, dear. l won't let you go alone. l will fulfill my promise. There is no problem now. These ways say my destination is near. We won't accept defeat. Beloved. Without you life is meaningless.
