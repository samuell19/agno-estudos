[music] Bill Black has been entertaining audiences for over 50 years. Founder of AC Comics, one of the longest running independent publishers around. He has created such characters as Femme Force and the Scarlet Scorpion. As a filmmaker under Nightfall Media, he has made several films based on his comic characters. A lifelong fan of monster movies, Bill has also made several retro style monster and sci fi films. Bill Black was born on September 14th, 1943, to parents John and Gail Schwartz. As a child, he grew up in the town of Tarentum, Pennsylvania, just outside of Pittsburgh. From an early age, he developed his love for comics and movies. I developed an interest in comics, I guess, around age six. I lived in a small steel town in Pennsylvania called Trentham, which was 20 miles east of Pittsburgh. And in that environment, all of us kids collected comic books. We always went to the newsstand. We knew when the new Congress would come out, and we were always there, and it was just part of our life. Before cosplay, we dressed up as our favorite comic book heroes and we had a kind of a ritual where every Saturday we'd get our allowance and then we would go to the movies and see like you see pictured here, like Roy Rogers and various cowboy movies, and they'd run a serial. And then afterwards I don't know what they did, but I always went to the newsstand and would see what the latest comic where they came in. So I'd say I started actively collecting comics at age six, and I mean, I did collect them whenever I threw them out. My parents would have loved for me to throw them out. It meant a lot to us, but it didn't mean so much to the adults yet. I'll have to say every household I went into except for my great uncle. Every household in that town had comic books in it. In addition to reading and collecting comics, Bill started to take an interest in art and drawing. I started my art career in the second grade when there was a little girl that I thought was very beautiful. Her name was Karen Love. How was that? She drew horses, so in order to get in good with her, I tried drawing, of course, horses way beyond, but that was my first attempt at the comics. But I never thought of it or art as a career. Later on, after I moved to Florida and I was in the sixth grade, I got in a drawing competition with my fellow classmates, a guy I'm not making this up. His name was Bobby Uncle Piller. He was from Louisiana and he would draw period pirate stories and make them as comic books. So I started drawing my own comic books. His was LA Comics or Louisiana, and mine was because I was in Pennsylvania. And my first comic book character that I drew was again, a time from the movies was The Black Commando, and they had rereleased the 1942 Columbia Serial, The Secret Code in the early fifties, and I saw that in the theaters. And that started a mass character called the Black Commando. And he was the first comic book characters that I ever drew, and that started me on my drawing career. And the reason I continued drawing after that competition in the sixth grade was as comics were canceled, I would try to drama on version to keep it going. Eleanor sadly relocated to Central Florida in 1951, landing in Winter Park. Bill found the comic and movie scene in Florida to be much different from his former home of Pennsylvania. Eventually, Bill was able to find someone that shared his interests and this opened up new opportunities up north. Everybody was in the comics and went to the movies. And then when I moved to Winter Park, I was a mile and a half away, away from the nearest movie theater, whereas in Pennsylvania, I could walk through it. So it was an ordeal, but it was a ritual I did every week. And there were a lot of I went to the theater in Winter Park. They would have yo yo contests and stuff like that. So some of my classmates would go to that. But I was the only one that when the monster movie craze came, that I was the only one that went to those. And I would have to then take a bus from Winter Park into Orlando to see those movies downtown. From the third grade to the 12th grade, I only met one of the guys that actively collected comic books like I did. And one day I was in art class. I would have been, I guess, in my senior year and this transfer student comes in. He transferred down from Washington, DC and he walks in the class and he has a folded up copy of Famous Monsters of Film Land in his back pocket. So I said, Brother Pat, I mean, I mean even more obscure than like in comic books. It was obscure to like monster movies. So his name was Jim Cavo, and he was a fellow artist, and his father was actually a cinematographer in the Air Force. And there was Orland Air Force Base, and that's why he moved to Winter Park. So he had interest in filmmaking and interest in comics, and we worked together, usually with him in front of the camera and me behind the camera, although sometimes we were both in front of the camera. Motivated by his love for monster movies and knowing a few like minded people. Bill acquired a camera and began to work on making films. And when I was in high school, I got a used eight millimeter movie camera I never had in my entire life to this day, had two nickels around together. So home movies was was a popular thing in families. Everybody had a home movie camera. My family did. So I went to a camera store in Winter Park and found a used camera that was within my price range. And I wanted to make black and white movies because the movies I would see in the theater, the monster movies, were all in black and white, and very few they were ever done in color. So I want to emulate that. So you couldn't buy black and white film locally. You had to mail order it with the ability to shoot movies in black and white the way he envisioned it. Bill started the process of making his first movie. I think the first one was Invasion of the Bargain, and I made a monster head out of papier mach√©, and he kind of looked like the monsters. And I married the monster from outer space. That impressed me that there was probably makeup on that, but it wasn't like applied to his face. It was a headpiece went over his head, and I guess my mother helped me, made a black bodysuit for him, and we shot that and we got a couple of girls that we thought were hot from my high school class, and we filmed a couple of scenes. Then we sent the film off to get it processed, and when it comes back, it's just worthless. It's terrible. It's all either overexposed or underexposed. It's worthless. So we had to give up on doing the black and white stuff, Always looking for new innovations to his filmmaking bill work to improve the look of his monsters. This led to a pleasant surprise. I really love monster movies. Monster movies were my life, and the only connection I had with Monster movies was Force Jakobs magazine Famous Monsters of Film Room, and he was running a contest in Famous Monsters. If you make up your own monster and if you become a finalist or the winner, you get to play a part in an American international horror movie, which at this time would have been a Vincent Price movie. Wow, what an incentive that was. So I didn't want to do a traditional monster. I wanted to do something unique. And also I was already making my own original movies at the time. So we made this movie or I made the monster for this movie, The Creature from Galaxy 27, and he was a humanoid monster, but his head was all wacky. It was like orange and he had ears and he had a single line in the middle, which was made from an egg. You know, you knock a hole in an egg and you flow the yolk out of it. Then you let it dry out and then you paint in an iris and pupil and put it in the head. You had an eye and I wanted to make him different than humans. So I had the soccer of the I had hair and then the mouth head here and he had, you know, things up and down in it. So that was so off because I had to have a name for him for the magazine. So it comes a lot because we never use the name in the movie. So I took pictures this a lot because it's entertaining. And lo and behold, I became one of the ten finalists. I didn't win, but I was there with like none other guys and famous monsters. Number 18. They got a picture of me and a picture of the monster being a low budget filmmaker, Bill had to find creative ways to add special effects to his films. How I did My Effects or I was very fascinated by miniature sets. And so I built as many as I as I could muster. And I my parents were long suffering to emulate a cave. I would get butcher paper, which was brown and add water all up. So it had different angles in it. Then I had masking tape to the walls in my house and then I would put the camera on a tripod at the other end of the corridor and turn it on. And I would go down to the other end and walk through the scene. So that was one version of of a practical set. And then I built a really tiny little spaceship cockpit on my carport where we just took a piece of masonry and spray painted it silver and it got some old radio tubes and stuff and made a little screen. And that was the bargain spaceship will continue making movies throughout high school, driving inspiration for scripts from movies of the era. The ideas in the movies were almost always centered around the monster. I liked to make monsters, and we'd make a monster. Then I'd come up with a story around that and I knew my limitations, so it would always involve high school kids, pretty much a creature from the Galaxy 27 to cover. And I although we were in high school, we were supposedly our government agents in that and we got my dad to be in it. So we would have a contrast. Yeah, someone older. But most of the other movies dealt with. I suppose it would be inspired by The Blob. The Blob was made in 58 and Steve McQueen was playing a high school student in that even though he was in his twenties. But I always thought that was a good example of how teenagers should act. The movies that I made, it would be like a spaceship would land and the monster would come out or a meteor would crash and the monster would come out somehow and get the monster out and he would be attacking one apart, shooting down death rays and blowing up the colony movie theater and stuff like that. But it always, always centered around the monsters. And I would handwrite the scripts, ready to get back to film making. Bill started production on his movie Black Mask. Chicago was a Catholic, and we wanted to point out the ludicrousness of the Catholic Church. Okay. And though so he was all for that. So he played the priest in the movie and he made the call up and wear the black suit and all that. And I forgot who I played, but I was the guy whose girlfriend was kidnaped by the cultists and they were going to sacrifice her in a black mask ceremony. And that ceremony would be the cutting out of her, of her heart and we were at I was going to Orlando Junior College at that time, and there was a character there, a student, fellow student. He was 15 years older than me. So he was like in midlife going back to school. And he was this weasely little, I guess you'd call him a rat faced like guy. He had a he had a close cropped goatee and he had teeth. Almost kind of like a rat. Right. And we thought, God, this guy would be great as the villain in our black Mass movie. He can be the the head cult leader. So we we talked him into it and he was all for it. He was a real nervous kind of a guy. And it turns out he was an artist, really fantastic artist. He did paintings in miniature that were just breathtaking and he did work for me. Later on when I started Peregrine Publications, he did some illustrations, but this was our first experience with Stuart Smith. Okay, so we make this movie and what he did while we were filming the scene ruined the plot of the movie and destroyed forever my relationship with my girlfriend. And that's all I'm going to say about it. Okay. And the sad, cruel thing about this is that I lost Kathy, but I gained Stuart Smith. It's kind of a lifelong friend, so we had to change the ending of that movie and it became a very pessimistic movie. And the good didn't triumph over evil. Evil didn't triumph over good. Everybody dies at the end of this movie. Everybody dies. So Kathy didn't get save. She got her heart cut out and my heart was cut out. This after finishing high school. Bill took the next step and signed up to attend college at Florida State University. I went there because it was recommended to me by my high school art teacher who was Mrs. Winslow, and she also lived down the street from me in on the same street I lived on in Winter Park. So I knew her all my life in Florida and I respected her. And she said that Flossie was a good school for art. University of Florida. Central Florida didn't exist then, and the only other choice was University of Florida, because at the time there was no film school of Florida State. Bill was free to do the type of movies he wanted. I got to do a lot of movies at Florida State on my own because there was no film school there. And also I did a lot in art because I got up with a renegade magazine publisher who I met at the off campus at Florida State with the help of a local renegade Independent magazine publisher. Bill had an outlet for his artistic talents and ambition. Every university or college has their own magazine, and it's usually a humor magazine where they make fun of the administration. They had one at Florida State. I can't even remember the name of it now, but of course, that year, under the auspices of the faculty and you can't get too outrageous or they bring the ax down on you. The charlatan was a renegade college humor magazine that was published and edited by Bill Killeen, who was a former student at the University of Texas and at the University of Texas. He and a cartoonist named Gilbert Shelton created a character for the U of T magazine called Wonder Warthog. Wonder Warthog has gone on to become very famous. And but at this time, this was the beginning of Wonder Warthog. So it was Wonder Warthog, which was a parody of the superhero, which was a comic strip, which got me interested in the charlatan, which got me up with killing. Now, he would set up little card tables in front of like the bookstore across the street from the university. He wasn't allowed physically on the campus, but he could sit up across the street at the sweet shop or the bookstore, and he would peddle his magazines. You'd have a big stack, and there are $0.50 apiece back now. Okay. So I explained to him who I was, and I was a cartoonist, all this kind of stuff. And I asked if he needed art. Most of he was getting art by cutting cartoons out of other magazines and pasting them up. So I came to work for him as a cartoonist and eventually became the associate editor. And we had a lot of adventures with the Charlatans, which was not limited by any faculty administration whatsoever. And we did. We were able to become popular by putting down being held at the University of Florida and all the Florida state deans and anything that the kids hated, we would put in there and they'd love and they'd buy the magazine and we sold ads to the local businesses, the pizza joints and all that. And I would do illustrations for the ads that would go in the magazine. And we did some of the covers. I never got to do a Wonder Warthog strip eradicate to draw him on the cover While working for the Charlatan, Bill became a part of history and controversy as the magazine set out to try something that had not been done before. Also, in the thing that gave the charlatan okay, every year there would be a voting on what's the best college humor magazine in America. And for a couple of years in a row, even though it was not associated with an actual university or college, the charlatan won. We got to have the tagline America's Number one Humor magazine. That was done under the masthead in the book. Also, all of these magazines would have a pinup girl and they would get some coed at whatever university, and they'd photograph her in a skimpy outfit or a bathing suit. And and since we couldn't call her the girl of the month like Playboy because it came out irregularly, she was called the feature girl. So there was a sense of propriety in that there was no nudity and there had never been any nudity in any college humor magazine. So of course, Colleen had to be strike out against the world to have the first naked coed centerfold in a college junior magazine. And this young lady's name was Pam Brewer. And she had all the necessary equipment and she was quite nice looking. And she became the featured girl in an issue of charlatan. And when it came out that she was laid out in the middle, completely naked, this girl on the news everywhere, I mean, not just in Tallahassee, everywhere all around the country, maybe even around the world. While at Florida State building, a friend came up with the script for Carnage of Dracula, Bill, wanting to change the look of his movie, decided to shoot it in a different format. I had been shooting movies in eight millimeter and the goal would be someday be able to do a sound movie. If you have to get a 16 millimeter. It's a very complicated and expensive system. Unlike today's telephone or cell phone or camcorder, where everything is combined into one unit. Yeah, they have all kinds of ancillary equipment to do a sound movie. But I wanted to see if I could. I had a movie coming up. I wanted to direct the movie. I was living off campus and one of my roommates was an actor or profess to be an actor and he wanted to be Dracula and he had his own Dracula, Carpenter's fangs and everything. So we went together and decided we were going to write a script and he wrote most of it and we were going to do a movie which we came to call Carnage of Dracula. And I wanted to try to shoot the shoot this in 60 millimeter. And I know that the sporting events at Florida State were filmed in 60 millimeter because there was no camcorders back in those in those days. So I found out who the man was that did this at Florida State. And I went to his office to talk to him about the possibility of borrowing a camera to shoot my monster movies while trying to game permission to shoot the film on campus. Bill found himself in a heated confrontation with one of the members of the faculty. The only thing I knew about this guy was that he was a German immigrant who had become an American citizen. But it was rumored that he had been a Luftwaffe pilot during World War Two, and in the last days of the War, Hitler was putting teenagers in cockpits, you know, because they were running out of men. So it's possible that this guy was that. But anyways, when I approached him on the subject, he blew his top. He literally hit the ceiling and he started ranting and raving and cussing and swearing and shaking his fist at me. Under no circumstances would anybody film any movies at Florida State University except him. He was the only man who was authorized to do it. No one would ever do it. No one can ever shoot any film on this campus except me. And he was dropping the F bomb right and left. And I couldn't believe it because this guy was in the administration. And back in those days, you know, even as college guys, we didn't swear all that much. And here it was unheard of that, you know, a person of authority in the university was ever me right and left and I was literally shocked. And he threw me out of his office and I was numb. I just it was on the second floor of a building on the inside of the building. It had like an atrium, an open space. And his office was on the second floor and had a balcony on it. And you could look down into the atrium. And I stood out in front of his office and he slammed the door on me. And I just it took me a couple of minutes to regain my senses from the assault. Discouraged After the confrontation, Bill found new inspiration in the carnage of Dracula, once again took off when he discovered a location right around the corner. And I started looking around this building, and the architecture of this thing must have been built back to 1920s or earlier than that. And it had this old European architecture. And I thought, Well, this would be a great place to film a Dracula movie, because the inside this building looks like it could be Dracula's castle. And so I walked around and I went, The more I looked, the more I saw that I liked know, it had some things like cast iron guardrails on the steps. And other than that, it probably could pass as it is a Dracula castle. So I made up my mind. I was going to film my Dracula movie in this building. Screw this guy. You know, I didn't have his camera, but I had my own camera. So we were going to do this, so I would would have to do it on the weekend. And so I went to the building on Saturday and Sunday to check what was going on in the building. And there was nobody there and no one ever locked the building. And I would walk up the stairs and go all through the building and I didn't find another living being in the building. So I thought, okay, we can make a go of this bill. Who at the time was not a student at FSU, decided to move forward with the on campus location. He and his team got to work putting together a cast and setting up the shoot. So my roommate Mike, he lined up actors from the Tallahassee Little Theater, and this is the first time I worked with actors who are older than people my own age. We we had people in the thirties and forties that were all people, you know, and he lined up a couple of gals. One would be the vampire young, one would be the victim and one guy would be the scientist. This guy and the one guy would be the boyfriend of the girl going to rescue her who gets a steak driven through his heart. And then Mike, of course, would be Dracula, although we didn't use the name Dracula in the movie, he was Bear in Law book. I was on his trimester system and I was not actually a student aforesaid at the time. So when I was recounting this to myself, I thought how impossible the whole situation was. I was living in Winter Park. That's a four hour drive to Tallahassee. Up in Tallahassee, my roommate Mike McGowan, is gathering up these actors who are going to converge on this building, which I remember the name of it, to shoot this movie. And it had to be on a Sunday. I guess. So. I guess I drove for hours. Must have left before dawn or something. We get up there and we don't know what we're going to find, but the building is unlocked and we go in and we go in carrying a coffin, carrying a a fold up cot to simulate a hospital bed. One of those blood plasma stands, you know, with the hook on it and the the container of blood on that. And the steak the steak people out and the make up. And we have, what, a cast of five plus me who's the director and cameraman. And we had a makeup artist. So all this we go into this building on the Florida State campus. Nobody is there. Nobody sees us, nobody cares. We must have shot, I would say, 8 hours in order to get this done. As the campus was empty on weekends, the shooting of carnage was a little less risky. Bill and his team started the actual shooting of the film. We had different parts of that building set up as different locations. Even so, we had the main character. He was out running through the exterior of the building, chasing the vampire, the vampire run by and the guy coming after him with the steak in his hand. And eventually we went into this building and we had to do things like make the Vampire girl age. So we had to put the embalmers wax on her face to make her look all creepy. So that took time and we the main guy, we had to drive the stake through his heart. So we put him in the coffin. We had this fake steak and it was taped to his chest. We had a different shirt where he had a slit in it, mistakes sticking out of it. Then he had to put the blood all around and all that. So it was a full scale deal. And like I said, we had a makeup guy doing it and we took still shots of solid all eight millimeter, which just it was quite a production for doing it, an eight millimeters, a silly thing. And we had the lights, all the lights, and I tried to light it like a hammer movie, so we would have the lights just off to the side of the of the camera and plug it into the wall of the building where we go. So we got away with it. And when it was done, then we went to one of the guys house and we shot some rear screen stuff where we we had the camera just sitting in a Volkswagen and we put a translucent screen over the back windshield and we projected with an eight millimeter projector the scene of driving. Look what we see driving from behind the car. That didn't work out very well. I think we cut that the mood. But we got all this done like in one day. And I guess I drove back to the Tallahassee back to Water Park the next day after shooting, Bill got to work editing the film during a trip back home with his father. Bill was able to get a little publicity for the movie, so editing it came together pretty good and it looked good. And because we had real actors and it was it was fairly convincing and I was proud of it. And it was obviously the best movie I made to date. And like I said, I was off of school that time and I put this together and my dad and I took a trip back to our hometown in Pennsylvania where he knew the guys who worked on the the Town newspaper, and he told them about what I was doing and they wrote a little article about it for the school paper. And I had with me the negatives that I shot of making of Carnage of Dracula. And his buddy there took him into the photo lab of the newspaper and he printed it. We have a whole bunch of eight by ten glasses, you know, from the movie that was really impressive. Through George Odom, Bill was introduced to a producer, Robert Carlson, who seemed more interested in investing money than the film itself. I found out that there was a movie producer who had a business in downtown Wicker Park, and as it turned out, his name was Robert CARSEN, and he was the father of a guy who had gone to high school with I didn't know him in high school. He was a underclassman. But anyways, that was kind of a link. So I guess to George on them. I made contact with Robert CARSEN and I took care of Dracula with my eight millimeter movie projector and I met with him in his just off of Park Avenue office in Winter Park to show him cards of Dracula. So Robert CARSEN and Guy Russo sat down and sat through my cartoons of Dracula. And I think more than what they liked about the movie, running through my head, what if they did this movie? Would I be the director? How would I direct cameraman with real cameras and stuff? I don't know anything about this stuff. I was very unsure of myself, but the fact that I mentioned that a friend of my father's was going to put $20,000 into it soon as they heard that they were my buddies for life. Okay? I mean, and so the real star turned in like, okay, a fall in is money are soon parted, and I'm the guy sitting there with the dunce cap on, and they're just licking their chops over the 20 grand I have. And I can see 20 grand being invested in this and every movie being made and they say, Good luck next time, kid. So it was part I was I was a coward. And part I felt I was being scammed, that I never went any further with that. But I went back and finished my career at Florida State and then immediately got drafted after that. But at that time, coverage of Dracula was my crowning achievement and it almost got made into kind of a real movie if I wasn't being fleeced feeling that Carlson was not on the up and up, Bill passed on working with him and returned to Florida State to finish college almost immediately following college Bill's next journey began As soon as I graduated from Florida State in 1966, I got my papers from Uncle Sam. I had to report for active duty April 19th, and every day between Christmas 66 and April 19th, I tried to figure out a way to get out of it, but I couldn't. And I went and if you're in the Army, you're you're at the mercy of what the Army wants you to do. You don't have any say, particularly when you go in as a private and this is where I noticed that I had acquired something which I've come to call strange luck, because circumstances that happened to me during my army career benefited me greatly under overwhelming odds. I mean, 1967 was the absolute peak of the Vietnam War, and it was my fear that I would be sent to Vietnam where I would either have to kill somebody or be killed myself. On April 19th, 1967, Bill reported for duty with the U.S. military despite efforts to get him to go to officer's training. With a little bit of strange luck, he was given his next assignment. They called me out and I had to go to interview to get my MOS, which is method of service. Every GI is assigned a method of service, which means what you're going to do when you're in the army. You could be an auto mechanic, you could be a photographer, you know, whatever else. So a clerk, which is what this guy was. So I got out of the gas chamber to go to this. And they also were always trying to get me because I had a degree. The sign up for officer's training school. Okay. So I wouldn't do that because if you're an officer, you had to serve three years instead of two. And I wasn't going to give up on the year of my life. So the guy that's interviewing me, when he finds out I'm an artist, turns out he is an artist and he's very disgruntled because obviously he's not an artist in the Army. He's working as a clerk, he's interviewing jerks all day long about in assigning them what their fate is going to be for the next two or four years. So he I guess he took pity on me and he gave me the most of an illustrator. Now, this almost never happens that you're actually given a method of service in something that you're good at. While in basic training, Bill found he was not a fan of the drill instructors and found a way to make some extra money doing what he loved. So anyways, during basic training I did a lot of things that made people mad at me. Of course, if you're known as an artist and there's career military men around you, Europeans, yes, you wouldn't have anything to do with you in the barracks. The guys, when they found out I was an artist, Hey, can you draw a picture of my girlfriend? So I did this, and you're paid something like $75 a month when you start off in the Army. So I made a little extra coin by doing sketches of girls, guys, girlfriends. One guy even had me draws mother, and this just pissed off the drill instructors. They just really hated that. After boot camp, Bill's Strange Luck continued as he was given his first assignment and then quickly moved somewhere more fitting of his skills. So when I when I get out of the basic training in Fort Benning, also in Georgia, I get papers to go to Fort Stewart, which is the Army bases closest to Florida. And at this time I'm dating the girl who's going to be my future wife, and she's a grad student at Florida State, and it's within driving distance to go visit her in their home in Jacksonville or at Florida State in Tallahassee. So I report to duty as an illustrator, and they put me in a place called Range Control. I didn't understand what that was, but there are guys that draw maps. Fort Stewart is this huge area. It's like 50 miles across and it's where they train for firing cannons and military high, big artillery pieces and stuff like that. And they have to have maps and stuff of the ranges. And so that's what they wanted me to do. Well, it was an hour job, but it was like what you would do in a mechanical drawing class in high school. The guy whose place I was taking, he saw my art and he realized I had abilities that were beyond what they needed there. So he got me transferred to and this is amazing. This never happens to a guy who ran training aids on on post, and his name was Mr. King. He was a civilian and he had two other civilian artists working for him. I was the only guy there, and he set me up and I was drawing things for the commanding officer and for different things that needed to be done. The training aids, which is real illustrations. I got to do cartoons and drew tanks, you know, stuff like that. While working for Training Age, Bill's boss let him use the facilities after hours for his personal artwork. So while I was there, Mr. King, who was a very nice man, took pity on me, and I asked him if, you know, I like to draw when I'm not on duty. He gave me a key to the place so I could come in at night and I had access to the drawing table and, you know, all the and stuff that was in training AIDS. And I came in at night and did that. And it was there that I do like a seven page story that I submitted to the Warren Publications to try to get a job when I got out of the Army as an artist doing horror stories for a creepy and eerie magazine, which is it just started about 64, I think. And that actually came to pass after I got out of the Army. Bill Prunty, the editor there, hired me there, and that was my first professional job. So again, this is very unusual. But working on training AIDS bill was presented with the opportunity to work for special services. There was another sergeant on the base I would just call on the sarge who was came to see me all the time and had me draw stuff he wanted me to transfer out of training AIDS, which was a plus position to go to work for him. A special services. Now, his special services was not the special services where you jump out of airplanes in the combat zones. This was he had he did a play in dances and gigs, ran movies and stuff for the dependents, the wives and children of the enlisted people on the base. So he wanted me to come over there to do posters. Now, I went over to his facility and I saw what he had and I met a guy there who was a brother that he had liquid projectors and strobe lights. And I thought, Oh, keep the thing I really hate about going into the Army 1967 is that the art world was exploding. Peter Max And you had Haight-Ashbury, had all that great poster art for all the rock bands and stuff. It was an artist dream. Everything was just fabulous and I was being taken away from that and locked up away from that for two years. One day, while Bill was visiting a friend in Jacksonville, he had a chance meeting with the person who would later become his wife. I had a friend who lived on college, the main street, to let into the university. He was off campus and I would go to his place to visit him and I would put my bicycle behind the bushes in his front yard so no one would steal the bike. And one day I was doing just that when I met this young lady coming out of the bushes as I was going into the bushes. And this was Rebecca, a very attractive young lady. She was a grad student at the time, and I was immediately attracted to her because in my twisted mind I said the long, dark hair down to her shoulders. And I said, you know, she kind of looks like Barbara Steele. So I started talking her up, and I noticed that she had a big portfolio under her arm. So I thought, wow, she's good looking and she's an artist. And I found out she was a grad student in at Florida State in Interior Design, and these were sketches that she did for her design classes. So that's how we met. As Bill was making plans to get married, he was given orders to ship off to Germany. This move would have made him Mrs. Wedding, but once again, his strange luck came into play and he was able to stay stateside while I was working it. Training AIDS. I got orders cut on me that I was going to Germany. And in the meantime, my romance with my wife, my wife to be Rebecca, it got to the point where we were engaged and we were going to get married on June 15th in Jacksonville, Florida. My orders were to send me like June 10th to Germany, so I would miss my own wedding. So I'm pissing and moaning about that. I didn't want to do that, but I was very glad that, you know, if you're only in it for two years and you get sent to Germany, there's no odds that you're going to also be sent after you hit your duty in Germany. There's not going to be enough time left to do a tour in Vietnam. So my nick was safe from that point on, but I didn't want to do it because I really wanted to get married. So in the barracks I'm in a room with seven other guys. Five guys in a room. One of the guys worked in the headquarters company PR and Love section, and he came up to me one day and he said, I pulled your files that head your orders to go to Germany. I pulled them out of the filing cabinet and took him and dropped him behind the filing cabinet. So you didn't have to worry about going to Germany. You can go ahead and get married. Sounds good to me. So when the sarge found out about this, he said, What we're going to do is you're going to sign out for Mr. King and training AIDS and you're going to come over and work for me and I'll get you set up over there doing that. So that's what we did. So I've been a cheerful adieu to Mr. King and all the nice people. He was so nice to me there. I hated to see them like that, but I also wanted to get married. So I just walked over the side of the post and started working for training AIDS. I mean, for the special services. Now working for special services. Bill settled into his new assignment, and John Gilmore set me up teaching photography, teaching, painting. We had our own painting studio with all these easels, all the big hemorrhages and stuff in the dark. When we had all this, the government paid for it, hired my wife Rebecca as the secretary. She ran the admin. She administrate the duties of the craft shop. There was a gallery in front of it where they hung my paintings. Being in the Army didn't stop Bill from pursuing his love of making movies. We also made a lot of movies while I was in the Army and one that we made for it was called The Pod, and it was about a six foot long slug. I guess you'd call it, like if you could imagine a snail without the shell on the back. And we did another movie called The Pallid Mask, which is based on a series of short stories in a book called The King in Yellow by Robert W Chambers. I was fascinated by that book in that it was a series of short stories about a book, a fictional book called The King in Yellow. And if anybody ever read the book, The King in Yellow, it drove them insane. So making a movie about people reading this book and going insane fit in with my way of making movies and the Fellini's surreal nature of it. And so we had a lot of a lot of fun with that. Bill. Now, comfortable in his role at Special Services, found himself once again being transferred to another assignment. I been transferred out of headquarters company to a automotive mechanic company because they had to have a certain number of people under this auspices. Even though I wasn't working in the motor pool, I was there, but I was there on their books only I went to roll call once a month or I had to be there at 5:00 in the morning. They called my name. I said, Here, and that was it. Then I went back. That was the only time I wore a uniform was for that hour that I did roll call once a month. I wore civilian clothes, I taught photography, I taught painting, We made movies. John Gilmore. I made movies together. And that ultimately led to the creation of my publishing career. Toward the end of his time in the Army, Bill, looking to start a fanzine, convince his bosses to buy a printing press and started what would become Paragon Publications. So I had learned about fanzines by answering ads in the back of Marvel Comics and ordered some fanzines. I learned that there was a place you could market your cartoons in comic strips other than through Marvel and DC, which were pretty much the only publishing company. So I decided I would do my own print, my own publications. So literally the last week or so I had in the armory before I went out, I, John asked me what we wanted to spend the all this money we had left over on. First words out of my mouth were printing press. So we drove into Savannah and we bought a we went to the abbey, the company, we bought a printing press. We bought the camera to shoot the negatives, the processing stuff, all the the ink and the paper and all this kind of and I had a training aids under Mr. King. I had drawn this. What if the Golden Age, Captain Marvel, had been brought back in Marvel Comics of today, where Stanley was creating Peter Parker, a guy who had a lot of personal problems or personal problems of Captain Marvel have. So I had this story and I put that together with some other stuff and put together a 40 page magazine. And the very last days I was in the Army, we printed this thing on this printing press, and that was the start of Paragon Publications. During a trip to Georgia, Bill drew inspiration for his publishing company. Why was it called Paragon? Because Rebecca and I, on a weekend we were out in the Georgia countryside, stopped at a restaurant that was called Paragon, Georgia as redneck as you can get. And this was very unusual. The decor of the place was kind of almost psychedelic, and they had very nice placemats and the logo on the placemat was the word paragon because it was the Paragon Restaurant. So I stole the placemat. And remembering what Bill Clinton taught me, I cut that out and pasted that up as the name of my fancy was Paragon Golden Age. Great. And that was my, you know, on the name of my company And the first publication that I did, his time in the Army concluded Bill found himself looking for work in the civilian world. Okay, good to his word. Once I got out of the army, I was hired by Bill Prunty, and I did a few stories for Creepy Interior magazine, which gave me my end to professional world of comics. And I it was it was good. But I, I was used to doing what I wrote, you know, in here. I had to draw what somebody else wrote. And I didn't like that as much because I was not that disciplined an artist. And anyways, also I went to work for a film production company. Another strange luck thing. I'm out of work, I have a wife and you know, what are we going to do for a living? And a guy comes to the house to sell me an insurance policy and I tell him my sister, he says, Hey, I know this guy is starting a film production company down on Karen Drive in Orlando. And through that I got a job when I was working there as an illustrator while trying to have kids. Bill and his wife, Rebecca, discovered that adoption would be the best option for them. We tried to have children and couldn't. We went to a doctor and they gave us the tests and it was determined that neither one of us could produce a child. We were living in Castle Barry in central Florida, near Orlando at the time, and we got up with an adoption agency. Oh, I don't think I was working for a film production company at the time, or maybe I was unemployed. Rebecca had a really crappy job, a low paying job in South Orlando. We didn't have much money, so I don't know if it cost money to adopt or not. But anyways, when we went over to look at the baby, they decided this would be a good match for us. We drove over to Daytona. We put blankets in a cardboard box. Okay, put that in the back seat and we go in and, you know, I was all like, I don't know if I want any kids, you know, because it's going to really change our life and everything. And then I saw the baby with, Oh, we're taking this home. Okay. So it did it changed everything. And it was we took her home in a cardboard box and we tell Laura this now, this is my daughter, Laura. I named her Laura because I said I was a really big Vincent Price fan. And I said, We're going to have to name our child after a character in a Vincent Price movie. And Rebecca said no to the idea. So we went for Laura because she made Laura with Dana Andrews [laughs] and Gene Tierney in the late forties, early forties. So she became Laura and we put Laura in the cardboard box, stopped at McDonald's on the way back and had lunch, and we went with little opportunity in the Orlando area. [laughs] Rebecca got a job working for Florida State University, prompting them to move back to Tallahassee. At that point in time, my wife had got a really crappy job working for a construction outfit in South Orlando. So we were living in Castleberry and she was driving this enormous distance every day on I-4, which is a nightmare. So She contacted a people she knew at Florida State to see if there was a teaching position there. And the fact that she was a graduate, she had a master's degree from Florida State in Interior Design, which is designing houses and living rooms and things of that nature. And the woman who, Dr. Will, who is in charge of that department, was thrilled to hear from her and sort of harder on the spot. So we knew if we went to Tallahassee that my wife would have a job and she always an associate professor in that school. And she also manipulated her political ties to get me a job working as an illustrator at the media center there, where also made films. And we did slideshows and did things for the president of the university while in Tallahassee, Bill began to work on his next film, Bloodsuckers from Outer Space. While we're in Tallahassee, we again started making we started making a movie called Bloodsuckers from Outer Space. I had become a fan of the old movie serials, and this was like taking my comic book character, The Shade and the Girl from LSD and doing what Republic Studios would have done with them when they adapted. Captain Marvel in the forties. In other words, just take the name and the costume and throw everything out the window. And we couldn't do flying scenes and all that because I'm shooting in 60 millimeters sound. So we just did practical effects and I had these guys that were with the Florida State Flying Circus who were acrobats, and they did crazy stuff. We at a warehouse location, again, guerilla filmmaking. We didn't get anybody's permission to do that, so we just went down there and shot was a warehouse by the train depot and the guys would be running away in the shade, would be running up on this platform at the warehouse. And when they get to the end of the platform, head, dive off and dive into these guys and they'd go into a rough and tumble fight. Well, we didn't have any pads or we didn't have any knee guards or anything. I mean, these guys just did it and anything I could ask them to do, they did. And then we got some really amazing footage of this. So it was it was a great experience. While working on art for a film company, Bill received an interesting postcard from Marvel Comics asking him to join their team. Also, while I was in Tallahassee, I got a letter from a postcard from Roy Thomas at Marvel Comics. He said, Bill, don't you think it's time you started working as an anchor for Marvel Comics? And the day I got that, I had been working freelance for this. The guy I had worked with before in the film production company, he had given me lots of films to do the artwork for, and we were doing it through the mail at this time. I had a large family room and had all these cells, we call them art cells, like animation cells, where I would draw a black eye on one side and painted it on the backside in acrylics and like 50 or 60 of these in the drawing when I get this post postcard from Roy. So I'm in the middle of this big project. So even though it sounds like a thing that would be at the top of anybody's bucket list, I was so busy was two weeks before I even responded to Roy about it and the bit he did hire me and I did some stuff in 1978 for Marvel Comics. I can't say that it was an enjoyable experience. I would have much rather had been working in the sixties where I could think Jack Kirby or, you know, dictators or any of those guys that were no longer working with the company. In the late seventies, Bill took the gig with Marvel, working on the What If comic book. Roy had me do books, obviously under his auspices, and I did some issues of what if you were like a double sized book? So comics were only 17 pages back then. So but the what ifs were like 33 pages. So that was that was a good assignment to do that. While working for Marvel, Bill continued working on his fanzine. I also was doing my fanzines at that time. I had the first thing I did when I got to the Army was also start up the fanzine and I had those. We reprinted maybe 500 copies of that one with Captain Marvel when I was in the Army, and I sent this to a guy who knew Marty Graham, who did other another fanzine. He lived up in Boston and he said, Oh, you shouldn't release this because you'll get sued by fossil publications because they didn't do comics anymore. But they're still in business and they own the rights to Captain Marvel, we assume. And so probably you shouldn't do this. So I threw all those. I throw them in the trash and they kept a couple of copies of that. And but I converted Captain Marvel to Captain Paragon and created a character, Captain Paragon, which was the main hero in my Paragon Publications line. So did Captain Paragon stories and did Paragon Illustrated and Paragon Presents and various titles with Paragon, and I did Captain Paragon in his own book. And Whereas other fanzine publishers, they did like one title and they did different subjects within the title. I wanted to be more like Marvel Comics, where I had a whole bunch of different titles and as far as and I was the only guy that did that. Eventually, Bill made his way back to Orlando and began doing artwork for a film company. I moved back to to Winter Park, and I worked for the guy who was sending me all this artwork to do through the mail, and we were making films at a clip. We were doing like 200 films a year. It was incredible. So he had a real system going for doing things on the cheap and very fast. And again, I got to work on my stuff because we usually didn't start until after noon on that as well. So in the morning I could do the paragon stuff and then I shop for his stuff. He didn't care what I did as long as I got all the photography done and all the artwork done and I got the other guys like, Did you ever hear of Jerry Ordway? Okay, well, I heard Jerry and John Bailey and a couple other guys, Steve Hansen, Tallahassee, They help me get all the artwork done because we were like, we were doing 200 films a year and they're like 40 pieces of artwork and every film we did. So that's a lot of art. It might be something as simple as just press type on a cell or it might be an illustration. So I did that from 8078 into October of 82, when for political reasons, even though the company was was making a good profit, they had to get rid of the guy who was over us in the head office up in North Carolina, and they had to close down the filmmaking end of it. So I was told literally days before that I was out of a job and I was given, I think, two weeks salary above that with the fanzine doing extremely well. It was suggested to Bill that he take the next step in his publishing career, but fortunately the fanzines are doing very well. The fanzines were doing so well that we were selling. Okay, let me say this one fanzine I printed, I thought I was being selfish so I should do something for my family. So I had a swimming pool put in in the backyard for my family of the money I made from just one fanzine. There was no distribution. Everything was sold piecemeal, one at a time through the mails, and I was selling in the thousands of these things. So I was also doing this while I was in Tallahassee and brought it back down here to Florida and to central Florida and continue that. And one of the printers that I was going to said, why don't you do a real comic book in color instead of this black and white fanzine, things with the idea to turn his fanzines into actual comic books. Bill started AC Comics. I started AC Comics in October 82, and we started actually producing the books by January 83 with the printing press lined up. Bill got to work releasing the first issue of America comics. We would go and observe the printing and all that, and a lot of times I would change to a printer in Sanford, the Sanford Herald printed my comics for several years, and I would just load my car up with the books and drive them back here to this office and where we would assemble them and put them together ourselves at that point. So also at that time, the independent comics had just started and people who did those were aware of my paragon stuff. And David Scraggy, who was doing Pacific Comics, which was the very first independent comic company, he said, Bill, why don't you want to do that? And so I put those two things together the local printer and the invitation from Scraggy, and I jumped into it and we did initially American sushi. I hated the name America, so I changed it to AC comics as soon as I could. The first issues of the book were released with great success. The first comics AC Comics published. It was a left over from the Paragon. I had done a book called Fun Comics, and I had done three issues through Paragon, So I just took that material and we colored it and put that out as AC Comics first book, which is fun comics number four. And they had a broad cover and that was the first one, and it sold something like 28,000 copies. Now, running his own comic publishing company, Bill had to deal with the stress of being the only employee that was running AC Comics single handed. I was doing everything myself and I was really scrambling to get material together. For the first time in my life, I was faced with having to put out more than one book at a time, and on a monthly basis I had to come out with two or three or four books a month, so I was scrambling. What do I do? Or I do what I need to cover for this? When you go through Diamond or the distributors, you have to put your cover and your synopsis of the book out four months before the book comes out. And so this was the case back then. I had to have some that didn't even exist. I had to send them stuff and then I had to make it exist. By the time four months or so. That was the situation I was in, still running AC by himself. All of his hard work was starting to pay off as an independent publisher and we met with amazing success right out of the gate. And what killed it for everybody was Marvel and DC. There were comic book stores throughout the country at that time, but Marvel and DC could not sell to the comic book stores. So that was kind of a conundrum there where you had a store selling comic books, mostly back issues, but they couldn't handle the new stuff. So the independent market meant that now they would have new stuff and they would have product for the stores. And of course Marvel and DC weren't going to do this because it was an expensive process and they wanted to see whether we were going to sink or swim before they got into it. So we were going full tilt and we're being very successful and a lot of other independent publishers sprung up. Our AC Comics was one of the first five independent publishers and is the only of the five that still exists today. And literally hundreds of independent publishers have gone to come and gone since 1982. In order to make ends meet and keep AC going, Bill had to cut some deals with the printers. I'm not a businessman. I have no business sense whatsoever. It it was all set up on credit. You pay your rent every month on 30 days. So the world is set up to work on a 30 day cycle. So when you send a book to the distributor, you are paid by the distributor within 30 days. So I made the pitch to the printer that I can't pay you now, but I can pay you in 30 days. And my credit was good. So we lined up like that. So I never really I, like I said, I, I was working in film production and suddenly that company went out of business and I had to accelerate to live on and I had to come up with something. So we did this and I incorporated the materials I had at Paragon and turned it into a color process to do the color comic. And it did it all on credit. To this day, I've never invested any money into anything. We've been running for over 35 years on the basis of 30 days credit. While still working solo, Bill was introduced to someone who would become an influential figure in AC comics between January 83 and 1990. I did it all myself. Mark Hickey lived up north and he corresponded with me because I did the paragon of Girl families, the Phantom Lady, Good Girl art stuff, and he had good girls. And so he was sending me samples and he did some work for me through the fanzines. Mark Hickey co-created from force with Bill but was forced to drop out shortly thereafter, eventually, after we created Film Force and all that, he co-created Film Force with me. I wrote the story and created the characters and Mark penciled the first issue. And I think that and we were going on like that until he had some family problems and he had to drop out. Finally, Mark made the decision to move to Florida and joined AC Comix full time. By 1990, he had made up his mind that he would move to Florida and join me in an AC comics. And so he did. He came down and he was initially rented a room from Rick Levins, who was living in Julio. Mark ran the front office and I was in the back and he was kind of the guy that answered the phone. And he was a buffer to keep people from bugging me because as you can imagine, we worked 24 seven pretty much every day of the year to put out the book. So we we worked all week and so we worked into the night because it's a tremendous amount of work and there was only really two guys plus the artist. The artist, they did the drawings, okay. But Mark and I, we did the physical labor of putting the book together. Eventually, DC and Marvel were able to get new product into comic book specialties doors. Anyways, eventually Marvel and DC did go into it and they they did a special print run only for the comic book shop. And so now the comic book shop had not only product, but they had popular product that they could move. They had Spider-Man and Batman and Superman. So that kind of put the kibosh on the independent stuff. And there was there was a big crash in 84, 85. So we had like almost one good year and then the whole thing crashed. That's when everybody went into the and white comics because it was cheaper and you could survive. And how AC Comics survived for now 35 years. I guess just because Mark taking our crazy and we don't want to become accounts, right You know so while initially focused on certain books, Bill soon discovered that all the titles he created were marketable. I have a lot of number ones. If you don't go beyond number one, that means it didn't sell enough to go to number two. And I hate that some people interview me. They said, Why did you stop Captain Empire going after number four? Well, hell, if it was successful, I'd be doing it now, you know, I mean, so anyways, there are I know we have cataloged 130 different titles of AC comics. It's probably upwards of 150 or more now. It's only been in recent years that we settled into a certain number of books that we, you know, have carried on to go into the high number range bill, knowing that a certain number of copies had to be sold in order to keep his comic enterprise afloat, had to find creative ways to keep his characters relevant and updated, tried to make a go of it with the Film Force, and that has remained our most popular title for all of these years. But every time we do a spin off, try to put an article in our own book, or she can read her own book that doesn't fly and we can't figure that out. Also with the movies or I'm making Night Vale movie, you think the people that would buy the car, buy the movie, but they don't. And I have never yet to figure that out. But it's always like I've written them off now. But the history of AC Comics is one of hanging by your fingernails for 30 years, for over three decades. So you have to sell a certain number of copies in order to remain with them. And distribution. And we manage to do that barely. And it's always, you know, you never know when it's going to end. And I am amazed. I mean, we have to make all the characters immoral because when we started this, I mean, I remember we hit number 20 on film for a while. My God, it made it to number 20. Well, now they've been around for 30 years. I mean, we got to have them anymore when they're like, Well, we actually kill off John Wayne because she was supposedly from World War Two. And we got to the point where her alter ego, she would be 90 something years old. So we had to have her die. And then she just became this victory all the time. So she was an immortal from that point on. But these are things I never thought about when I started the company that would have any sort of success with it. During his time with Marvel, Bill came up with an exciting new concept that got shot down but eventually gave birth to his greatest seller Okay, Sound Force. When I was working, it, Marvel and I did a book for Roy. What if what if The Avengers were formed in the 1950s? And this is fun for me because it had characters in the book that I got the ink that were characters actually, but in the fifties that no longer existed, like Marvel Boy in general, Jungle and this kind of stuff. So anyways, he had in the book, he had Venus from the Fifties Gen of the Jungle, Nomura, which was Nemo's cousin. And I approached Roy. I said, Hey, what do you think about this? Why don't you do a book That's all female characters? You could put a blond Phantom and Nomura and take one or two of the Jungle Girls and Venus and had a miss America? Not very many, but they had a couple of Marvel female characters in the in the forties and put them together as an all female team. And he said, Now that would work. You said female characters just they don't sell. That's why we don't do very many female character books and not a team of females wouldn't work. So okay, time goes. I'm no longer with Marvel Comics and I'm finding I'm really enjoying drawing beautiful women and the sexy girl aspect of it. And most all of my characters are that. So I guess it was in terms in number one, I did a story. I worked with Wally Bloomberg, an artist on that, where I formed a group called Femme Force One. If you them e one word, Force one, the numeral one or the all girl squad. And I up phenom lady and blond bomber and there was another one there was forum anyways and that kind of caught on with them force as best bestselling title Bill recounts how the first issue came to be when when we went from Paragon to AC comics, I went more mainstream with the subject matter. In other words, I went away from the the sexy busty girl stuff to what would be traditionally in comics at that time in 1982. Okay, now everything goes in comics today. I mean, comics are much more risque in the lewd than anything I have ever considered at any point in my life. So we start off AC covers with and Paragon and the superhero stuff and all that. And then we got to the point where the market had died down in 1984 and I was struggling for content and. I had material left over from the Paragon days. So we put out some force as a special and to our surprise, it sold better than the other that we were doing. So then we started I guess in 1985 with that as a main title and all the other superhero guys who lost their own books, they became support characters in the film for Style. With an established publishing company, Bill was able to attract other artists to work on his books. Some of those have gone on to expand their careers and gain name recognition. A lot of guys that went on to have good careers worked with AC comics or got their their first gig at AC comics like Eric Larson's probably the most notable of them. But I started AC comics with Jimmy Sanders. A little guy I think was just in high school, just out of high school in Jacksonville. At the very beginning, he drew the story that I asked for what would be fun Comics number four, the Captain Paragon story. And he went on to have a good with Moore and of course, John Bailey. He was with me at age 17 and went on to do Secret Wars, Captain America and the Norm. The guys that got them, Charlton, Rick Levins, he had probably the longest stint on Captain America of any artist that ever worked on the feature Mark Probes and John Dale. They're still working in the industry. Rick Unfortunately, course passed away a few years ago and a lot of guys I knew or had access to that did covers like Pres and no Pat Broderick, Jerry Ordway, who I'd worked with in the fanzine stuff and for the film company he and Mike Mark, then they both went on working with Roy Thomas at DC on the Justice Society revivals. Mike's not doing anything anymore that I'm aware of, but of course Jerry's had a stellar career and I think he ranks as one of the best artists in the whole history of comics. He's he's just a tremendous, tremendous talent. And he did star films for me even back in the Paragon days. Perez He did the cover of American Comics, number one, and originally I was going to use a star Franco cover for that that Jim had done for me for one of my Paragon books. Over time, sales went down and Bill got the call. He was dreading. That came up when we got the The Executioner's AX call from Diamond that they were going to kick us off because weren't selling enough. And we talked with I talked on the phone with with Bill Shamus, and he's another guy that goes the way back to the fanzine days. And so he's he knows our history and he felt really bad. I could hear it in his voice that he was given the ax to the longest running in the comic company that was in existence at that time. And he made the suggestion that maybe we should concentrate on doing high priced books. In other words, we know we were going to sell a lot of copies, but if we had a big dollar sign on it, we would make the dollar minimum. That's why we came up with the idea of doing a $10 film for us in a 30 minute mystery in crypto horror. I mean, I never would have thought of doing that, but here we had the blessing of Diamond, and that's what they suggested that we do. And I never in a million years would have thought that that would have succeeded that. But we've been doing this for many years. Even so much to Bill's surprise, the characters he has created have withstood the test of time. I, I was amazed that we were succeeding and it was going as long as it did. And I could see that I had something that was lasting. You know, these characters weren't a flash in the pan. I seen so many of these other companies come and go and the characters forgotten about, you know, they had a years existence or two years, and then they're gone. But these characters are still existing and have gone on long, you know, after after I would have thought we would have fallen by the wayside. So that was unusual. And that's sort of my legacy that I'll be dead and gone. But hopefully, maybe the night Bill and these other characters will continue on after I'm gone. And it seems to be we're getting lot of new people in doing that, like the characters, and so it could perpetuate after that. I hope. I hope eventually Bill would retire from AC Comics and turn to day to day operations over to Mark. Even though officially retired, Bill continues to work for the company he built. Even though I am retired, I have made a commitment to work like you say, to do the next two issues of STEM force firm forces go back to color. And so I'm writing and inking and doing some penciling, the lettering and coloring. So issues of armed force. And so here of I've overcommitted again and it's a challenge. There were certain things that needed to be done in these stories because going to color we're going to a bigger audience and were going to hit people that have never read the book before. So I have to work into the story, who the characters are and demonstrate what their personalities are as the news and get in three issues and understanding of of of what you know, what the characters are and decide if they want to continue to read the book. So we're hoping that it will be successful. But you know, you never know. Also, in retirement, Bill finds time pursue his other love filmmaking. I didn't have time to do the movies and the comics, so now that I'm retired from AC comics, I spend my time doing this and also working the movies that I did in the eight millimeter days, like House at the End of the World. I really want to put that out on digital and, you know, finally finish those movies. I started 50 years ago. Freed from the handling of the day to day operations for AC, Bill was able to go back and finish the movie he had started years prior. I took the chapters that John and I did. They were done as single standing serial episodes, and we started off with like Chapter five. We do chapter five, six and seven or something like that, like in the middle. So we never had a beginning and we never had an ending. So I went back and made a feature out of that. I put the three chapters together and shot 30 minutes of a new movie and called it Naoko and The Lost Amulet of Volterra and put all the elements in it, like who is the mass villain and established characters that they are. And so the issue was the mass villain really. And that kind of stuff. We had a lot of fun with that. Looking back at one of his prior films, Bill decided to remake it using modern technology. Then I. I also decided to remake one of my early movies, which was The Amazing Colossal Woman, and that was done on such primitive equipment, and it was primitive software. It was such an embarrassment to me. So I used all the green screen footage I had of the leading lady who we composited in the maker of the giant woman, and she shot a lot of new footage, mostly up in the land, and added a lot of new characters to flesh out the story. And we took a a 25 minute movie and made it a 61 minute movie. And we had a lot of fun with that. And I got to meet a lot of new people working on that. And Bill, on a roll with his filmmaking, decided to make a movie that relied less on special effects. Then after that I did Shadow Slayer, which I purposely designed as a vehicle for Brant Berry, who worked years before on The Amazing Colossal Woman, and also as a movie that had very limited special effects because I goes, The Guardian is taking forever to be finished because of the extensive. Every scene in the movie is a special effect. And if you worked in an editing program, you know you have timelines and when you put a special effect, you put a timeline on top of that and a timeline on top of that. Well, in the John Woman thing, we might have as many as nine timelines with all these things compositing in one scene. This is very time consuming. The scene might last for 10 seconds, but it might take you a week to do it, you know? So the shadows layer was something I wanted to do where I thought I put more time into the camera work and not be so rushed in filming it. And it was 100% a Bill Black thing. I wrote it and I directed it and it was more of the kind of a movie I wanted to do, was had nothing to do with comic books. It was just a straight out horror movie, but not a slasher type movie. But I was very pleased with the way that turned out naturally. Being in the comic and film business, Bill has attracted some fans over the years. The fans of his work or that he embraces. They mean quite a lot. I've been reading the book on James Ward, who did the creepy and eerie and famous, and he he hated Sands. He said, I don't want fans over readers because it was all and that how many books are you going to sell? But it's a it's a different story today because the whole the industry is different. No one has the kind of circulation that they have now. And, you know, I guess some of the DC and Marvel books have a circulation of what the fanzines or back in the seventies, you know, so your bread and butter is the fans and I never thought I was like it was talking about Beloved. I was a fan of Beloved, I was a fan of yours and Neil Adams and Striker and all these guys and Lonnie Hill and Roy Rogers and Charlie Stewart. And I could see how paying attention to them in the later years of their lives meant a lot to them. And now I'm experiencing the same thing. Now, guys who bought my comics back in the eighties when they were kids, you know, now have grown up and had a family and had a job, and now they have disposable income and now they're going back and collecting stuff. And they're, you know, looking at my old fanzines and stuff like that. So and I've become, you know, friends with a lot of the fans and I enjoy it. I have a really good relationship with a half dozen fans, Eric MATTHEWS and Mark Holmes and Jay Williams and Cliff Weigel, who there's, of course, books of Dylan, Florida, all of these guys, they're very supportive of me and I really appreciate it. Bill, now retired, you look back with fondness on his creations and the life that he has made for himself. Starting a car that was that was a challenge. And that that, of course, is my legacy. That and creating some force, I think, is the most important achievement of my life. And, you know, one of your questions was, did you think it would last this long? No. With his working days behind him, he was free to create his art, be it movies or drawing on his own schedule, a luxury that he most certainly enjoys. I've never been happier than when I'm doing my own thing. And like the Frank Sinatra song, I got to do my life. I did it my way. And in fact, if I brought the lyrics to that song and that can be my testament, I'll tell you, there's only one line in that whole song. I would change an otherwise otherwise carbon copy. This is, you know, my testimony to my life. Working at Marvel was not a thrill. I would have hated to have drawn Spider-Man. Who would want the end those buildings, the spider web and all that. Right. But and, you know, I was a fan of the Fantastic Four. I would have loved killed that Jack Kirby on the Fantastic Four. That would have been a highlight of my life. But I think I'm far better off having done my own thing and creating my own colleagues. So I'm glad I did what I did. We never made it big, but I got to do what I wanted to do and I did it when I wanted to do it. And it's even better now that I'm retired because I don't have to face the monthly deadline. At the end of the day, Bill is an artist at heart and loves to create, but really enjoying getting back in the drawing and experimenting and stopping when I want to stop. And with my family, I get interrupted every hour anyways, and with my heart problem I fall asleep every hour anyways. So you know, I do what I want to do, what I do when I want to do it, and I can stop and start whenever I want to do it. And I, I, I have created a line of characters that I really have infused with what I believe is a life of their own and they have their own personality and, you know, characteristics. And so it's it's easy to write them and it's like, I know them like they're my own daughters and sons and no way out. And so I enjoy being with them when I'm drawing them and when I'm writing them. It's fun and it's a challenge. It's still a challenge, though, whether it be through his art filmmaking or just his personality, Bill brings joy to the people he reaches. And with a new movie in the can, he doesn't show any signs of slowing down. I love doing movies, and I grew up on I grew up on comics and movies, starting when I was six years old. There wasn't a weekend in my life up until I got married. That didn't go to the movies on the weekend, and I bought every comic book I can get my hands on. It's always a superhero or somebody had a mask. People think I like westerns. I like Westerns. If it's the Lone Ranger or Black Rider Drag kit, some of the sort of masks that I like that. But yeah, I have become a big Western fan, but I'm, I'm excited by all this and I enjoyed doing this. And now that I'm in retirement, I don't have to do it for a living. And that is like cutting the bonds that bind you. It just you're free to float and do whatever you want to do because I don't have to do it for the money. I have no kind of a business man, but yet, for whatever reason, I ended up okay, I have systems in place that my family is taking care of. If I die tomorrow, they will be well off. Okay? And that's good. So this is the type of freedom that I can really enjoy. Bill continues to make movies, comics, and the time to go out to conventions and meet his fans. When you're a creator, you had this urge. You just want to do it all the time. If you have the ability and it doesn't matter whether anybody thinks you're any good or not, or whether you do have the ability, you have to do it. You have to create. I mean, there are a lot of terrible artists who became really big like Grandma Moses, so you guys would know who that this little lady who painted so badly that it was good and she became very wealthy doing the words garbage. You could imagine that. It's just something I'm compelled to do and I will continue to do until I drop. And I know it's my way and that's what I got to do. I'm sticking to it. Okay. Not bad for a guy who has had a little help from some strange luck. [music]
