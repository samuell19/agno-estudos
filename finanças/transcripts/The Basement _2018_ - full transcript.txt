(deep tense music) (woman screaming) I'll do anything. Please, don't. I'll change. I can change. I promise, please don't. (screaming) (mellow piano music) We're out champagne. Oh, no champagne? What's a poor girl to do? Get her brilliant, sexy, amazing husband to get it from the store? Ah, the labor of love. See you in a bit. (tense eerie music) Hey, how are you, love? What's up, superstar? [Craig] Working maid, I see. [Lauren] Yup. [Craig] What is this insanity? [Lauren] There's some crazy people out there, huh? Right. Truer words, my friend. Truer words. (eerie ambient music) (suspenseful music) (Craig grunts) (eerie ambient music) (groaning) Fuck. (grunts) What the fuck is going on? Hello? Fuck, come on. The fuck are you? I'm Bailey the Clown. Oh, don't be shy, Billy. What? (lively orchestral music) What? Here. Hold this. (groaning) Well, that wasn't very nice. Get away from me. Billy, have you been smoking? Have you? (thuds) (grunts) Smoking can kill you and lead to forest fires if you're not careful. What's that bear's name? Ah, Yogi. Yeah, yeah? It's not it. Well, nevermind. I'll think of it. Time for a fun fact. Whoo, what? I fucking hate that one! I hate it! Fuck! Ah, here we go. Dolphins are unable to smell. Did you know that? No! Well, they can't. And there's a football team named after them. You know I'd like to have a football team named after me? What, are you a fan? Did I not sign an autograph or something? What is this? You mean you don't recognize me? No! Are you sure? Yes! Well, I'm Bailey the Clown! Yes, you've said that. Everybody knows Bailey the Clown. (Bailey imitating honking) Don't fucking touch me! (thuds) (grunts) There will be no cursing at this party, young man. Time for another fun fact. Ah, did you know that beavers were once the size of bears? I mean, that's a big beaver. (honking) (phone ringing) Kelly Owen, calling for you. Should I tell her you're all tied up? Ha! All tied up. Absurd. (squeaking) Kelly Owen, 5038 Coral Canyon. Well, that's not far from here. That's right up the PCH. If you so much as look at her, I fucking kill you! Do you hear me? I will kill you! (thudding) (grunting) Fuck. Language, Billy. Watch your language. You don't want me to have to get out my bar of soap. Why are you calling me Billy? My name is not Billy. [Bailey] And on with the show! Why are you doing this? What do you want from me? Can I be honest with you? Yes, please. Sometimes, what you see on the outside is not what's on the inside. Take me for example. I smile all the time. But on the inside, a very lost soul. Well, I gotta go. But please, like, follow me on social media. I am Bailey the Clown. (deep eerie music) Ah, Smokey! I knew I'll think of it! (clucks) (breathing heavily) Hello! Hello! (mellow brooding music) (knocking on door) [Police] Police, open up! Help, I'm here! I'm here! I'm in the basement! Oh, thank god. He's upstairs, he's upstairs. [Police] Freeze! Do not move! Show me your hands! I can't move my hands. I'm restrained. Please, he's upstairs. He's wearing a clown costume. My name is Craig Owen, please. Oh fuck. Okay, okay, I'm not going anywhere. Turn in off. Turn it off, now! Turn what off? The blowtorch, goddammit! Turn it off! God, how could you? Look, man. You've got the wrong guy. My name is Craig Owen. I'm a musician. No, we got you now. I guess seven wasn't your lucky number, was it? Detective! He's down here, I got him! You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say could be used against you in court of law. You have the right to get an attorney and if you can't afford one, the court will appoint you one. Please, please. I haven't done anything. [Police] What did you say? I haven't done anything. Give me a reason, you low life scum. (deep suspenseful music) There's a special place in hell for people like you. (breathing heavily) Oh god. What did he even say? Fuck, what's going on? (phone ringing) Fuck, I cannot. Can you, please? Kelly! Baby, please, help me. Baby, please. Hey baby, it's me. I'm just worried about you. Give me a call, okay? Bye. (deep brooding music) How you doing, Bill? Huh? (Craig grunting) Don't make this difficult. We know you did it. (phone rings) Kelly Owen. Sister, you must be one sick twisted bitch hanging around with the likes of this guy. [Craig] Touch her... And then what? Hm, what the fuck are you gonna do? Hey, you wanna tell me where you were last night, Billy boy? [Craig] My name is not Billy. Where the fuck were you? At the store. That's my memory... You paid Allison Perry a little visit, didn't you? No, I don't know... Shut the fuck up! There's seven people dead. Seven. And we found Allison Perry decapitated in Silver Lake. But you knew that, all right. Look, motherfucker! Untie me right now! Right now! Right now! (thuds) (grunts) (dark brooding music) Listen, please just untie me. All right, I'll walk away. This never happened. Never. Never happened. Well, why didn't you say so? Never happened. The only thing is. It did happen! Now, I want you tell me that you killed those seven people. I want you to tell me where those six bodies are. I don't know. I don't know. [Detective] Tell me! I don't know, I don't know. I wonder. How difficult would it be to knock out a tooth? Shut the fuck up. I'm trying to concentrate. You don't want this gun to accidentally cough in your mouth now, do you? No! No, no no. (Craig grunting) Huh, not that difficult, really. Surprising. And you know, I would think enamel would be a lot harder than that. But then again, I'm not a dentist. Look at that. Two for one. It must be my lucky day. Oh. See, the problem is you spit those out on my clean fucking floor. (Craig groans) Chew 'em. What? Chew the fucking teeth. (teeth cracking) (groaning) Swallow them. What? Do it or I'll knock the rest of your goddamn teeth out. Open up. Let me see. (yells) All right. Did anything seem weird? [Lauren] No. Was he talking with anyone? No, not that I saw. But, you know, we've been pretty busy. So nothing out of the ordinary? No, just paid and left. Wait, Lauren, do you guys have security cameras outside? No, just inside. Okay, thanks. Money is no object. How much do you want? How much do you want? You're not gonna be able to buy your way outta this one. A clown who cuts people's head's off with a blowtorch. Jesus, just when I saw it all. So, how's this old thing gonna play out, Bill? You're Bill. Oh, god. You're Bill. Oh, fuck. You know, you confess to the killings. You tell us where these other six bodies are, make the DA takes it easy on you. Gives you life instead of the needle. Huh, what do you think? Okay, okay. They're in a storage unit in Van Nuys. You expect me to believe that? [Craig] It's true. Okay, tough guy, what's the address. No, if you want to know where the bodies are, I'll take you there or no deal. You drive a hard bargain. (thuds) (grunts) Oh, fuck! You bastard. You fucking bastard. So what was that address? 819, 819 Park Avenue. Park Avenue? Van Nuys is a shit hole. There's no parks in Van Nuys. You wanna tell me those bodies are? Because I would really hate to have to pay your wife a little visit. (gunshot bangs) (steady ringing) Whoa! That was loud, huh. Last chance. See you. No. No, please. Please, she has nothing to do with it! She has nothing to do with it! It's been about three hours now. He went to the store but he never came home and his car is still parked at the store. 24 hours? 24 hours, are you kidding me? Something has happened to my husband. You're sorry? You're sorry? You're worthless, that's what you are. You're fucking worthless. (doorbell rings) (deep brooding music) (grunting) (grunts) What the fuck did you do to her? I swear to god I'm gonna fuck you so badly, all you did is nothing. This is nothing! [Bill] Oh, you're close. [Craig] Fucking! Look how close you're getting, brother. Well, you motherfucker, did that to me, huh? You fucking do that to me? I'll fuck your goddamn head off. You're my bitch now, you hear me? You're my bitch now. You know how long I've been waiting for this day? Guard told me you were coming last week. Welcome to San Quentin! Fuck off. I'm gonna run down the basics for you. You're ready to spend 22 hours a day in a cell the size of a bathroom. No privacy. And don't worry about bending over in the shower 'cause you're gonna be fucked sooner or later. And you're responsible for buying your own toothbrush, toothpaste. The state does supply you with a little green bar of soap. It's kinda itchy but you'll get used to it. All right, don't trust anybody. Your best friend today might be your worst enemy tomorrow. Well, you could pretty much get anything you want. Drugs, cigarettes, decent food. Just gotta pay for it. Paid a pretty penny for these babies. What do you think? Pretty neat. Hey, come here. What are you doing? Listen, if you untie me, I can get us outta here. Oh, yeah? I know a guy on the inside. When we're out, I can get you anything you need. Anything you want. (sniggers) But man, what's your name? You don't know me? Why you? And you knew my sister? No. Mary Beth? No, I don't know any Mary Beth. Today is her birthday. I remember in her seventh birthday, we live this little apartment in Bakersfield and my mom's boyfriend came over and they gotten into a fight and he knocked her out cold. But we ran in the bedroom and Mary Beth and I and the locked the door and she was crying her eyes out. And he kicked in the door and I attacked him, right? But I'm seven, man! I'm seven, what can I do? So he shoved me against the wall and tied up my hands and feet with a telephone cord. And I remember Mary Beth had on the rainbow underwear that she got for Christmas. And he had his hand around he little neck while he violated her. I screamed and I screamed. (grunting) When he was done, he pulled up his pants and he came over me. Carved this cross into my arm with a Buck knife and he said Jesus Christ died for your sin and then he walked away. A little while later, I got it tattooed, I guess as a reminder. I ran into him a few years ago. He's no longer with us. Mary Beth, she was not not really the same, man. She got fucked up with drugs and shit but she would visit me every week and bring me fresh baked cookies. It was my favorite part of the week. That was until a month ago. When they found her. She's in a better place now. She's my angel and I would do anything for my sister. Listen. While I can't pretend to know what you and your sister went through, my wife was if foster care. It was awful. She was in one of the families thatjust keeps the kids for the money. They'd lock her in a closet. When they went out at night and they came back, my wife would pass out drunk. And her father would molest her. She still has nightmares about hearing the sound of him unbuckling his belt as he walked towards her door. Fucking liar! Don't you fucking lie! Don't fucking lie! No, really. [Bill] You're fucking lying! Really, I'm not! Take it back right now. Okay, okay, I take it back. I take it back. Bloody no. No, no. No [Bill] Yes. No, please! Please, no. Not my left hand. Please, not my left hand. Not my left hand! (yells) Oh, fuck! Now, why'd you do it? Why'd you do it? Please, I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say. (Craig yelling) No, you cunt! You fucking cunt! - This one. This one's just for luck. (Craig groaning) Fuck, man! Look what you did. The guards are coming. Ah, fuck you man! I'm not done with you yet. Okay, I'm not finished. I'm gonna see you. I'm gonna see you again. Fucker. (Craig sobbing) (dark eerie music) I didn't know who else to call. Kelly, we're best friends. Who else would you call? [Kelly] Thanks. So, were you guys fighting or something? No, as a matter of fact, we just had great sex. Oh. He always answers his phone. Maybe his phone died and he ran into a friend. He'd find a way to call. (deep eerie music) Oh, Jesus H. Christ. Oh, no. Barbarians, I see. Oh, god. Who did this to you? Now, there it is. That's okay, I'm sorry. Bill? Do you have any allergies? Your vitals look good. Everything seems to check out there. Okay, now, look, Bill, I'm here to help you, okay? So I'm gonna need you to stay calm so I can sew up the wound and stop the and stop the bleeding. Oh, there it is. Oh, lord. Now, normally, I'll be able to sew this back on but do you see the gray around the edges there? Basically, that means it's dead. That's not right. Doc, there's no gray. Doc, there's no gray, you can sew them back on. Please, you can sew them back on. Please, you can... This is gonna hurt a bit. It will hurt. We slide it out. There it is. Please, that's my wedding ring. Now, for future reference, any severed limbs, you gonna wanna stick them in a glass of milk or bag of ice. Okay, that keeps it fresh and increase the chances that they can be sewed on later. You know, most of the times after surgery, they work pretty well. I don't know if you remember. A few years back, there's a fellow who got his penis cut off, well, he stuck it in a glass milk, they sewed it back on, I heard he shot a porno with it. There we go. Oh, I know, I know, it's gonna sting like crazy. Stop, stop. It will keep it from getting infected. There we go. Everything is set. Don't, please. Please, I have to go to the hospital. The hospital. [Craig] Please. Now, you don't need to go to the hospital, silly. No, you can't do this. Please, I have to go to the hospital. Please, I have to go to the hospital. It is funny that you mention hospital. When I was a kid, we would always go straight to the emergency room for everything. And remember this one time in the emergency room, there's a gentleman who came in who lost his foot in a lawnmower accident. Now, apparently, he was mowing down the hill, wet grass, slipped, his foot went right on mower, cut it clean off. When they came in, they had wrapped his stub in a green towel and they duct taped it all up to hold it on there. You know, there's a lesson there. You always gotta be careful when you're cutting the grass. You know, come to think of it, that's the last time I saw my mama. I was 12. And while we were waiting, she snuck in the back and tried to steal some painkillers. (Craig grunting) They arrested her and me and my sister end up in foster home. We eventually got adopted out to two different families. Split up. Well, you know, whatever. You cannot let your past define you. Please, Doc. You took it out. You took it out to help people. I know right now it seems bad but in six months, you're not even gonna miss these little old fingers. I'm a fucking guitar player. Well, that is a setback. But here's the fun fact for you. Did you knowJerry Garcia? Do you know who he is? The fellow they name that ice cream after. Well, he was missing and just look at all the things he did. All right, we're just about there. (Craig grunting) One more good one ought to do. That's good, that's real good. Just cut this. Good as new. All right now, I'm gonna leave work with the prison nurses. Have them change that on a daily but I'm gonna need you to keep it clean, Bill, okay? Try to keep the heart above the heart as much as you can. Fuck you! It's natural to lash out. That'll be it. There we go. (Craig groaning) This is my card. Now, when you get out, I want you to call me and I'm gonna take you to lunch. Get you started on the right foot. All right, Bill. I have to go to the hospital. I have to go. I have to go. Bill, remember, keep that hand above the heart as much as you can. All right. Fuck. You don't think he relapsed, do you? No. What? He's cheating on me. Are you sure? [Kelly] Yeah. Well, how do you know? A girl knows. Do you know with who? No, but maybe he's with her. I'm sure he's not, I mean I'm... God, I can't believe he's cheating on you. What the fuck? (Bianca clears throat) Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. I hear you. I hear you. The thing is it's a feria, you know. And it's a small scratch. It's really not that big deal and I don't see why it's taking so long. Right, I know but I need it by the weekend because we're going to the summer house next week. I'm with him. Right, okay, okay. Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. Look, I gotta go. All right then. I'll talk to you later. Bye. Sorry. How are you holding up? I'm never better. Listen, I've been at the governor's office all afternoon. There are people outside picking it. Okay, they're calling your name. They chant Bill, Bill, Bill! It's fucking beautiful. But here's the bad news. I've done everything I can do. I've filed every motion, gone down every legal avenue. You know, it's the governor. He's not gonna sign a stay of execution in a goddamn election year. (sighs) So I guess you don't need me to tell me this but that doesn't give you a lot of time. We're scheduled for 6:00 a.m. What about my insanity plea. I thought that was how you are going to get me off. Well, they came down on the side of personal responsibility. But I'm insane. Clearly, I'm insane. Well, they don't think so. Well, what do you think? Me? Well, you know, that's not really for me to decide. You know, it gets me so angry. We live in a modern society in so many ways but we are still embracing this archaic eye for an eye system when we should be rehabilitating people. Look, I'm gonna need to tell them what you want for your last meal. Bill, listen to me. Look, I had a terrible time growing up. My parents were both strict and indifferent. I was a poor student. I had trouble connecting with my peers. I barely made my way through school. But there's one teacher who took some time with me. Showed me a few chords on the guitar. And I found this solace in music. Gave me a sense of purpose. And some mates and I started playing some shows and got the attention of the producer and the record label. And everything happened so quickly. Barely had time to think. I was riding so high on warmth and adoration. Then after some years, things changed. And the songs didn't come as easy anymore. And we've carried on but it hasn't been the same. Everything I've ever known was falling away. I've realized I didn't even know who I am because I've never really taken the time to find out. Fumbling along in a haze. Grasping for bits of happiness and clarity along the way. I know what's it like to feel lost. I do. I hear you and I see you. I understand your trouble. Bill, I'm sorry. Please, Bill. I'm not perfect but I'm a good man. Please. Please, you don't have to do this. Please, Bill, I'm a human being. Please. Please, don't do this. Bill, don't do this. So, can I put you down for a cheeseburger? (dark brooding music) I want a 20-pound slow roasted turkey. It's gotta be something simple. Like a pizza or cheeseburger. Well, it's my last meal. I should be able to have what I want. Pizza or a cheeseburger? Pizza. Crust, crispy. That's a really good choice. I woulda went with a pizza too. There's nothing like a good pizza. Bill, I don't wanna give you any false hope here. Okay, but there's always a chance that the governor could change her mind the last minute. It's uncommon but it happens. [Bianca] Has he ever cheated on you before? Not since we've been married. I mean not that I know of. Just wondering if he's just fucking the bitch or of he loves her. What are you gonna do? What do you think I'm gonna do? I'm gonna run the bitch over with my car. What would you do? I mean you're amazing. You deserve better. I would leave him. I think I like vehicular manslaughter better. (Bill groans) Well, here we are, son. Yeah, I wasn't, I wasn't gonna come here. I always thought you would amount to so much more. You were my boy. I'm still your boy, dad. Dad, you have to help me get out of here. What? It's gonna be a little hard with this glass between us and these guards. How could you do this? How could you disgrace the family? You do know that you're the reason I am like I am. No, don't put that fucking shit on me. Every man makes his choices in life. [Craig] They do that? They do. They do. I never heard anybody that didn't have it coming to him. Was there some horrible way that I wronged you when I was four, hm? Is that it? 'Cause you just had to leave me with my addicted mother. Well, your mother was a batshit crazy whore, I'll give you that. Did you ever hear about when Mary Beth was raped? Well, after knocking mom out, her boyfriend broke into our room. Tied me up with a phone cord and he raped Mary Beth. She was wearing this rainbow underwear that she got for Christmas. That poor little girl. That poor sweet angel. (thuds) (grunts) (grunting) [Bill] Look, the little got raped and you didn't do a goddamn thing! Please, I was only seven. (breathing heavily) Dad, dad, you've broken through. Dad, there's no glass here. Dad, please, you can help me. Well, I guess I better get on down the road. Dad, please. Dad. Please, you have to help me, dad, please. I'll see you on the other side. No, dad, please. Dad. Dad, wait! Please, dad, come back! Dad! Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck! I know this is the third time I've called. Can you please just check again. Yes, his name is Craig Owen. Are you sure no one has been admitted by that name? Okay, thank you. Hi, mom. This can't be happening. Not to you, not to my sweet Billy. Not you. I love you, mom. Are you okay, do you need anything? You know, I have extra money and I'll leave it here for you. I leave it in your books and get like a snack or a soda or something, you know, before. Thanks, mom. That would be lovely. Do you have any water? No. You know, I. I carry this with me. Do you remember? Do you remember drawing this? You were five. Yeah, I do. That's me, you and Mary Beth. It always make me feel like you're with me. Oh, god, you. Baby, can I smoke in here? Sure, mom. Thank, god. I'm trying to quit. It's just, with everything. It's been a bad month. You know? It's been a lot. It's just been a lot. Can I have some? (eerie ambient music) You know, I did everything I did for you. I did it for you and your sister. You know that, right? I do. I do, I really do. I was just trying to build a new life. I just thought if we could get out of the city, maybe I don't know, go back to Bakersfield. You know, you're Uncle Ted. If I could get a job, save a little money, we could get a like a little house. Would that have been great? Yeah, it would. You know that I tried to get you back after they took you away from me. You know that, right? I know, you did the best you could. You know, I forgive you. I do. Thank you, baby. I have to go. No, we still have some time. I have to go. Oh, oh, baby. I'm gonna give this to the court so they could give this to you so that you could have this for when... You know for when. You know, I just wish that they would let me hug you one more time. Well, you can, mom. You can hug me, please. Please, I've missed you so much. Go on. Mom, mom, please. Please, you have to help me. Please, you have to help me get out of here. Please, mama. Please, they're doing bad things to me here. Please, they're hurting me. Mama, please. Mama. Mama, please, please. Please. Please, you have to do something. I have to go. I'm gonna be praying for you. You stay strong, sweetheart. Okay, you're gonna be in a better place soon. Okay. Thanks, mom. Thank you. Bye, baby. Oh, fuck. Dammit. Just isn't like him. I mean you know him better than I do but it just doesn't seem like something he would do. Let's just try calling him from your phone. You know, maybe he'll pick up. Yeah, sure, okay. I'm just curious. Why is my husband's contact in your phone? Kelly, we're all friends. I know, itjust seems weird. I can take it out if it makes you uncomfortable. It's fine. Shut your mouth. [Craig] What? Close it. [Craig] What? I'm not gonna yell. What? Whoa, set 'em on decline. Dammit. Where's that a pizza? You know, I deliver pizza in high school. One bag, decent tips. Every time they screwed up an order, I'd get to eat it. This one time, a lady came to the door. She invited me in. I mean she's not hot or anything but when you're in high school, who cares, right? Fuck it, I still don't. Dammit, don't they know we're short on time? (doorbell rings) Finally. Listen to me. Keep your cock and balls with you, all right? Or that duct tape's gonna stay on your face until I get back down here. You got it? Good. It's 19.44. No some for the effort? (screaming) My wife and I, we like to role play. Do you wanna join us? No, I'm good, man. Weird. (mumbling) For you if you want a beer. Gotta a couple in the cooler in my truck. I know I'd want one if I'm sitting where you're sitting. [Craig] Aw, you son of a bitch. (mumbling) What was that? (Craig groaning) Oh, that smells good. Peperoni, you know that's the most popular pizza topping? One fun fact for you. That crust doesn't look very crispy. Eat it. Okay, I just I wanna go home. Okay, it's just my job. I bet that prick cut your finger off. I'll tell you this, if you ever get shanked, I'd look the other way. If you look the other way, I'll shank you myself. So the doc got you all sewed up. Is that what you call that? Yeah, he's good. Fucking barbarian. Well, better go now. That's it? [Bill] Yeah. You have some interesting tattoo. What does it mean? It's a Gemini. The twin. (eerie brooding music) Bianca, where were you Thursday night? What? Thursday night, where were you? I don't remember, I think I went out with a friend, Who? Danielle, why?

I'm here for you. If you'd like to talk, we can talk about anything you like. God, football, politics. You could do a confession. Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been. Well, I have no idea how long it's been since my last confession. I accuse myself of the following sins. I've killed seven people. I've tortured them in unspeakable ways. Was it sexual in nature, my son? It was, wasn't it? For these sins and all the sins of my past life, I ask absolution and penance from you, Father. Are you sorry for your sins? Would you like to be forgiven? Yes, you too can be forgiven. You can. You're a good person, Bill. You just gone down to bad hand. I see you. Please. You can stop this. Just untie me. Let me go. I will help you. You can confess and be absolved of your sins. You can get free from the devil's grasp. I know you don't want to do this. I know that you have heard me, Bill. It's tough sometimes. This job, you get emotional. I'm sorry. Would you like to take communion, my son? Yes. The body of Christ, the bread of heaven. The blood of Christ, the cup of salvation. Let the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ keep you in eternal salvation. (Craig laughing) Fuck you. Fuck you and your god. You nasty fuck. And I forgive you, my son. Bill. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen. (brooding ambient music) Don't do this. No. Don't do this, please. No, please. No! No! Please! Please, don't! Please, Bill. Please, I don't wanna die. I don't wanna die, Bill. I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die, I don't want. I want to live! Please. Please, I have to say goodbye to my wife. I have to leave a message! Let me! Let me, please! Let me let me leave a message, let me. Please, let me. My wife, I love you. I love you, my wife. My wife, I love. Kelly, I love you, baby, I love you so much. I'm so sorry. I love you. No, wait! Don't, no. Don't do this, you don't want to do this. I know that you don't. (deep suspenseful music) Please, don't do that, don't! Don't do that! Don't, don't, don't! Oh, fuck! No, no! No, Bill. Don't do it, Bill! No! No! No! No! Fuck you, no! No! No! Fucking terrible have to be! Fuck me! No, please, no, don't! No! No! No, stop it! (yelling) (dark rock music) (eerie ambient music) He went to the store and I haven't seen him since. He's not answering his phone. Yes, I've called the police but they won't do anything for 24 hours. (doorbell rings) Hang on, there's a police officer at the door. I'll call you back. Well? It's done. Now, be a dear and take out the trash on your way out. You're a tough guy to find. In for the cookies. Sure. What have you been up to? Oh, same old. How's the acting going? Mm-hm, yeah, it's, um, it's good. Have you heard about this Gemini killer? Yeah, some, some, some. How does it feel? What? To cut someone's head off with a blowtorch. I don't know what you're talking about. Come on, carving the Gemini sign into your victims, wrapping their head in a green towel with duct tape? My twin brother is a serial killer. How many people can say that? Sweetheart, it's me. I'm not gonna tell anybody. I do need you to do something for me though. What? I want you to kill my husband. Why would I kill your husband? Because he's fucking my best friend. You just get a divorce. Prenup? All right. You can back to killing random street people later. They're not random. I need you to do this for me. Okay? For me.
