So many letters! Where are they coming from? Thank you. Yes? There are several flights to Jogja today. Good afternoon. Can you recommend the best vacation spots for those with children? We recommend Sri Lanka. But if you have the budget, you can take a tour package to the UK. - Really? - Not that far. I'd prefer somewhere closer. Easier to walk around. On the contrary, we should go far away. Just like those foreigners. If possible, give us an affordable price. Affordable. But not too old-fashioned. So, if Mom is tired, I can go find a fun place myself. What are you talking about? - To Europe? - Yes. I want to commemorate the second anniversary of my mom's passing. - Commemorate what? - Something like that. Remember when we were in high school? We planned a trip to Europe. That imaginary trip? The trip that must be brought to life. That's it. That's it. What? I had a dream yesterday. My mother and I were strolling up a hill. It was so green. So green. When we reached the top, there was a town. - Cha. - It was so cool. - On the edge, there were trees. - Cha. Marsha. Marsha! Have you been to Europe? How can you be so sure it was in Europe? No, I've never been. That's why I need to find out. You should come with me. No. I just refused the bonus from Mrs. Regina. You can ask her for more bonus. And ask her to give me a discount too. I don't have the budget for the trip. But this is for fun. We can enjoy the scenery, we can go for a walk looking for hills, we can take pictures... - We better... - We can go to a flea market. Just tell me how much your budget is so I can make a calculation. You're coming then? Tell me how much your budget is and I will calculate it for you. You can calculate your budget at home and text me the result. Okay? Come on. TAXI "'If you want to become a rocket, you must not be afraid. You must be brave. You must have a dream, and must be brave enough to achieve your dream.' Timmy's mom smiles at him. Timmy smiles back at her. 'Thanks, Mom.'" Oh my... We'll go brush our teeth now, okay? Brush our teeth. - And then...? - Brush teeth. - Brush our teeth. - Teeth. And after that, we will wait for Dad in the bedroom. Okay? - Okay. - Okay. Dad will take a shower now. He's smelly. - Love you, honey. - Love you. Maleo Tour, good afternoon. Yes. We have a promo deal for tickets. - Okay. - Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Welcome to Maleo Tour. How may I help you? Okay, sir. Okay, ma'am. Here you go, Laura. Please check again. Okay. How many people? Maleo Tour, good afternoon. All right. Yes. We have several packages. Yes, there is. I beg your pardon? Oh, sure. You can come. - Laura, we're heading off. - Bye. - Bye. - Take care. - Bye. - Bye. Yes. Take care. It's unusual for you to come home while the sun is still out. - I know. I'm leaving now. - Take care. Yes, Mom? What's the matter, Grandma? Laura. Laura! Nurse! Laura. Laura! Laura. I think I have a cold. I want to go to a doctor. Hold on. Who is that? You have a new friend? - Where did you get it? - From Dad. From Dad? For my birthday, when you were sick. When I was sick? Yes. All right then. - You want to play with us too? - Yes. "Aunties, even if I take a flower bath every day, if it's not the time for me to find a life partner, I won't find one." I bet your aunties were not happy to hear your reply. They were too nosy. - Is Luna sleeping? - Yes. Okay. I think I will head to bed too. Night, girls. Night, Auntie. What's wrong? Nothing. I think I'm just tired. How was Europe? Do you really think I would still go after hearing you were in a coma? Of course not. You didn't go? No. I'm waiting for you. Waiting for me or the discount? Both. - I knew it. - So when can we go? - Cha... - La! Come on. When I saw you lying in a coma at the hospital, there was only one thing in my mind. That life is short. Death can come at any time. And I don't want to die before fulfilling all my dreams. And I know you're the same. I still can put my dreams on hold until Luna grows up and is ready to be left behind. Laura, a child will never be ready to be left by their parents. - You know that and I know that. - Yes, yes. I understand. - But what I mean is... - I know what you mean. I know exactly what you mean, La. I'm just talking about a trip to Europe for two weeks, okay? The departure and return dates are determined. You will return home to Luna. Unlike when you were in a coma. Nobody knew if you would return or not. Where is this conversation actually heading? To Europe. Bye. THRILL MOUNTAIN IS OPEN Thanks. Good afternoon. Fortunately, we are having a promo deal for tickets. For Asia. That's right. - Oh, okay. For how many people? - Okay. For how many people? Good morning. Yes, we can. Okay, we will write it down. Yes. Hello. Good evening. I just want to know something. The bonus ticket I got last time, can I still use it? Thank you. Good night. I think this is everything. - Are you sure? You didn't forget anything? - I don't think so. Mom, please take care of Luna. I put the "what to do" list on the fridge, so just follow the list. I've been taking care of you for decades. You don't think I can look after Luna for two weeks? You took a motorcycle taxi? No. That's my new boyfriend. I told you about him. Of course it was a motorcycle taxi, Laura. Is that all you brought? This, the motorcycle taxi driver, his scooter, his family... I'm going, Mom. - Take care. - Please look after Luna. I will. - Bye. - Bye. Okay. - Have fun. - Thank you. What do you have in here? Be careful with the luggage. - Ow! - Oh! Excited. - La? Come here. - Cha. Hang on. You! From when we got to Shiphaus right through till now, you've been busy with your phone! Hello. - Mom, we have arrived in Amsterdam. - What? We're going to get you a phone card over there. Okay? For you too? No. Since you're going to buy one, I will just use yours. That way. There are three rules. Why do you have to make rules? Number one, we have to stick to the plan that we've made. So, if you want to change the plan, we have to discuss it first. Number two. You have to respect my habits. Okay, I will respect your habits. Number three. All the expenses will be divided in two. Accommodation, transportation, food. Everything. Except for personal shopping. Personal expenses are paid individually. Yes. - One more. - Why are there four rules now? One more. Don't interrupt me when I'm talking. That's it. Come on, La. Over there, La. There. I'm going there real quick. I want to see. I'm just going to ask questions. No, no. No need. Let's go back. - Why are you doing this? - I just want to know. - There it is. That's the coffee shop. - What? - Cha... - What? That's not a coffee shop. Yeah, I know. I just want to go in there real quick. - Five minutes. Two minutes. - No, Cha. One minute. Oh my! "BEFORE YOU FORGET, AND IT'S PROBABLY BETTER, I WILL JUST GO." Laura. Ta-da! The arrogant roll. Cha, is that what you bought at the coffee shop? Of course. But why? We have to go early tomorrow. There's no way we can finish this tonight. Look at this. But there's no way we can bring it with us tomorrow. What if there are police? What if there are guards at the border? Then we will finish it tonight. Cha! Cha! - We'll share. - Whatever. If you don't want to try it, fine. I MISS YOU, MOM. We're two hours behind schedule. I told you not to do it, but you still did it anyway! I said I was sorry, La! La, wait for me. Give me that. Let me help you. No need. - Ouch. - You slept like a dead person. La! Wait! La. It's not as depicted on the website and brochures. Just accept it. - What is this? - That's the checklist for this car. The ones marked with a check were already damaged. So, when we return the car, they can't complain about it. And 50% of this is marked. As long as it fits our budget. Are you sure you can drive on the left? Yes. My driver's license is an international one. I have one too. But I bribed someone to get it. And I took the test to get it. Just accept it. As long as it fits our budget. Be quiet. PAID PARKING UNTIL MIDNIGHT Watch out, La! Yes! I see that! - Laura. - What? - Let's go to France. - France is not on the list. If you go to France, you're breaking the number one rule. - Okay. What about Belgium? - No! - If we stop to buy water? - No! - To pee? - No! Your life must be miserable. You can't eat anything. Do you know? Water is more expensive than Coca-Cola here. So, we'd better save money. We still have a long journey to go. Water is good for your health. I'm so sad. Why? You've been scolding me since this morning. Even my mom never scolded me this long. We are two hours behind our schedule. It's only two hours, La. What do you mean, "only two hours"? So many things can happen in two hours. Give me an example. Like... Whatever. Maybe two hours ago, George Clooney ate here and we missed the chance to see him. George Clooney is in America. Maybe Bono? Whoever. Bono is Irish. He must be in Ireland, Laura. Maybe he's on vacation, maybe he ate here. That's possible, right? Your example isn't accurate. Ruud Gullit. A football player from ages ago? He's Dutch, right? Suriname! He's from Suriname, Laura. But wait. How do you know about Ruud Gullit? You never play football. You don't even like football. You never watch football. Or maybe... you went with Ryan to watch it. Ryan liked football? La! La! Oh my, where have you been? I've been looking for you like crazy! This market is so huge and confusing. Imagine if you'd gotten lost! Why are you mad at me? Who left and disappeared first? Who disappeared? I told you where I was going. By the way, these are my new rings. You have to see them. This one... La. This one is a symbol... La! La! But it would be better if... Oops, sorry. That was your fault. I'll be outside. Who is he? I just met him. Turns out he's traveling to Germany, Austria, and Venice. It's true. So he can help us with directions. - We won't need to ask random people. - No way. Why? This is better than getting lost. Germany is far away from here. We'll have to ask people for directions, tell them our story, and by the time we get to an intersection, I'll have forgotten everything. No. Tell him to get out. No. Tell him to get out of the car. - Why? - This is so reckless of you. - What if he robs us? Steals from us? - No way, La. Just look at him. He doesn't have the face of a thief. Right? Cha, you're so reckless. I said no! La, come on. Okay? What's your name? Say hi. La! Let me take over the driving for you. - It's all right. - I'm still fit. Come on. - What if something happens? - Are you sure you can drive? Of course. Let's find a place to take a break. Look at you, you look exhausted. We'll pull over here. - Cha, what are you doing? - What? You can take a nap. Just let him drive. Okay? Just try to sleep. Whatever. We'll split the accommodation costs three ways now. Okay, whatever you say. Okay. Ask Finn to pay his share. And give me yours. Can you pay with your money for now? My money? Why? My money is all gone. What do you mean? I used it to buy the rings this afternoon. - You spent all your money on rings? - So? Cha! Okay, now what should we do? Pay for it with your money. I will ask Finn to pay his share. And my share... I will call my office tomorrow and have them transfer me money. - I will pay you back. - You're so sloppy. Okay, okay. Or... hold on. This is my ring. You keep it. This is a mood ring. The color of this ring can change according to the wearer's mood. And... and it brings you luck, Laura. - Cha... - It really, really brings you luck. And it's more expensive than the cost of staying here overnight. - Here. - I don't need collateral. Fine, 'cause I need luck for my friend to pay me my money back. Come here. Meet these guys. This is Levy. He owns the caravan over there. "BEFORE YOU FORGET, AND IT'S PROBABLY BETTER, I WILL JUST GO." We have to go early tomorrow. Don't stay up too late. Yes. Not bad, huh? Free food, free accommodation. We even got a souvenir for free too. My mom was right. The nature will give you what you need at the right time. Scoot over. Watch your hands. Cha! You were the one who told him not to sleep in the caravan, so he slept here. I thought he'd left! It's okay. He couldn't sleep in the forest. Can we just leave this place, please? But he... he... Come on. Just go. Come on, La. Drive. About four or five more hour's drive. We're still on the road. We're heading to Munich. What did you say? Yes. Mom, tell Luna I said hi. I will call you back. - La! What...? - Cha. - Do you know where we are now? - Germany. You know what we need to do more? We need to stop more, take more pictures. Look. Cool, right? With the windmill in the background. Cha, I just saw a map. And we... We're going through Kassel. - Cha! - So? We don't have to go through Kassel. We're going farther than we should. Yeah? Cha, do you...? Cha, we are lost! You want what? Cha, you deal with your friend. I'm... Whatever. Whatever! - La. - What now? We've only deviated a tiny bit from the intended route. But we still went off the route, right? - He won't be long at his friend's place. - Why do you always take his side? - Because he knows his way around here. - Yeah, but he lied to us! He didn't lie to us. If that's not a lie, what do you call it? He didn't tell the truth. That is the same as lying! Fine, so what do you want to do? We can go by ourselves. - But it's different, La. We never... - Different how? We go by ourselves. No. We have a map. - I know, but it's a different country. - We have a map. No. No. Enough. Now, we go by ourselves. We have a map. We can do it. That's it. Are we turning left or right? Left. Left. But looks like we have to turn right. Who knows? You got rid of the person who knows the route. Okay then. We're turning left. Cha. - Let's just turn around. - Hold on, La. Cha. Cha? What are you doing? Hold on. Look at this. You and I are very different. You can't enjoy simple beauty. Just look. Look around you closely. It's just a matter of minutes... Come here for a second. - There's no U-turn here. - Ah, you. Damn. She's pretty. - Are you alone? - La! Get in the car! Cha! Hurry up! Cha! The car won't start! - Get out of the car slowly. Slowly. - Get out how? We can't! Get your bag. One. Two. Three! Cha, wait for me! La! La! Hurry up, La! Cha! Wait for me, Cha! Cha, wait for me! - Hurry up, La! - Cha! Cha! Cha! Let's play a little. Cha! Come here! Come here! Come back! - Let's go. - Where are we going now? We'll try that way. Cha. Cha. I think my wallet and my... and my phone and my passport are gone. Maybe I dropped them. Do you have them with you? In your bag? What should I do? I don't have them. Here. Let me put this in your bag. I don't have room in mine. Cha! My passport, my wallet... I don't have them, Laura. I lost them too. What's wrong with your arm? Come here. Don't you want me to take a look at it? Don't do it. - My arm... - Just a minute, Laura. - Do you want to stay out here all night? - I'm talking about our passports. Yes, I know. Let's go inside there. Let's go. Come on. Let's go. I want to know what's behind the door. What are you doing? Give me a second. Maybe we can sleep here tonight. Cha. La! - La! La! - What? La, you've got to. Cha, this is... crap! This is the smell of beer, not crap. - I can't stand it! - La! La! This is the smell of paradise. And now... where is it? I put it here, didn't I? Picture. - Cha, stop it. - Yes! I don't know why I agreed to go with you on this trip. Look on the bright side. - What? What is the bright side? - Listen to me. What we've experienced is nothing. You've never experienced being stranded at the sea for two nights, no food at all, or been in the middle of a forest being chased by wolves only come across a huge bear three times your size. You've never experienced it, have you? Have you? Never. I mean, all those experiences are valuable. - There must be lessons in them. - Oh my... You'd better go to sleep now. Get some rest to calm your mind. To refresh your mind. Because when you feel refreshed, you will know what you want. Yeah, right. What do you mean, "Yeah, right"? Like you know what you want. Of course I do. What do you want? Come on, La. Not yet! Chicken. I want to ask you something. When was the last time you were hugged by a man? The last time you were hugged by a man? I was what? You're cute but deaf! Four years. That's a very serious question. Four years? Four years? Insane. Don't you miss being hugged, being kissed by a man? Being loved, getting a loving nickname. Honey, baby. Am I right? Oh no, no, no. Sit down, sit down. Reminds me of our high school days. I lost my shoes. I lost my wallet. I lost my phone. We don't even know where we are. I'm supposed to be home. Get out! Get out of here! Run, La! Don't stand in the middle of the street! - Stop! - No! Hey! Come on, La! Come on, La! Over here, over here. Mom? I'm sorry I'm just getting in touch now. How is Luna and everyone in Jakarta? Yes. Tell Luna I said hi. Bye, Mom. - Come on. - Where are we going? I don't know. They told us to go that way. Fine. What actually happened? Why are you asking me? You were the one who suddenly asked to get off the bus. Because you looked super upset. Nothing happened. Just tell me. - Nothing. - It was Hugo, wasn't it? Come on, just tell me. I stole their camera. I stole the camera that they used for filming at the lake earlier. What do you mean, "Stole the camera"? I stole the camera. You don't realize your bag is heavier now? You're crazy! Why did you steal it? They were being disrespectful to you, so I punished them. Cha! No. They were okay. It was only Hugo. See? "It was only Hugo." So, I was right. Hey, are you hungry? Hungry, thirsty, upset. - Upset cause I don't have money. - Keep your spirits up. Spirits from Hong Kong? Why Hong Kong? We're in Austria, Laura. La, let me borrow your bag. - What for? - Stay here. - Just stay here. - Cha! - Hey, Cha! - La, hurry up! He's chasing us! Who is he? I don't like the way you got food. - Why do you have to keep stealing? - Just once in a while. I'm starving. I feel like I'm about to die. Why don't you just die? Here. - No. - Come on, just eat it. Fine. Don't die, La. Think of Luna. La! Let's just skip Vienna. I think it's too far. We have strayed too far from the schedule. Finally, you realize it. Yeah, yeah. Tomorrow, we'll find a way to go straight to Venice. I want to make a stop in Verona. Verona? I thought our schedule was to go to Amsterdam, Munich, Vienna, and Venice. I have no problem with it though. You were the one who made those rigid rules that can't be broken. Are you thirsty? I only have this. If you're thirsty. La. La. La. La. Wake up, La. La. Wake up. You have to see this. What is it? Look. Let me get the camera in your bag. What is this, La? There's a date and month here. Give me that. Does this mean you're still in touch with Ryan? Just give it to me! It's none of your concern anyway. Why is it not my concern? Let's not talk about it. Why can't we talk about it? What? What is there to talk about? It's just, out of the blue, Ryan sent me a postcard and then sent Luna a gift, that's it. What is there to talk about? I guess you like the "out of the blue" type of guy. Out of the blue, he asked you to marry him. Out of the blue, he left you and went who knows where. Out of the blue, he sent a postcard. But that's none of your business, is it? You went to Europe with one destination in your mind, right? Verona. You played the boss and made the rules. And in the middle of the journey, you say, "I want to go to Verona". Bullshit! Why are you furious? Because you didn't tell me! What? What is it that I didn't tell you? I've told you everything. I have told you everything, that's true. But you? I didn't know about this. Okay. You might've told me everything. But nothing is clear, right? Including your purpose for coming here. La, I told you at the beginning. I came here to mark the second anniversary of my mom's passing! You still don't get it? I should have come here with my mom, not you! Fine then, why don't you go with your mom? With your imagination. With your green ring. The ring that you said contains your mom's spirit. Go with them. Why did you ask me to go? The dreamer here is you, Laura. But... What do you expect to gain by going to Verona to see Ryan? Were you going to knock on his door hoping he'd be faithfully waiting for you? That he wouldn't sleep with another woman? Even you weren't faithful. I have been faithful! Listen to me! You were tempted when that band manager touched you, weren't you? Okay, okay. You just used me, right? Why would I do that? Why did you need me to go with you? To get a discount ticket, right? To make your trip more affordable, right? To make your book a best-seller again, right? That's why you need me, right? Have you ever appreciated me even once? During this trip, who paid for things? It was me, right? Did you even pay anything here once? You spent your money buying those ridiculous rings! You measure everything by money, huh? By numbers. You say I don't appreciate you? You're insane to think like that! Did you think that I need money to survive here? I don't think so! One more thing. If you think I don't appreciate you and only care about writing a book, then you've gone too far. Next time, if your friend writes a book, even just one page, read it! Unreal! - Shallow! - Who's being shallow now? You always think everything is easy. You act like a kid. Do you think that's cute? No! That's silly! - You're talking nonsense. - What nonsense? You. You think... Do you realize one thing? You're the silliest person I know! At least my life is on the right path. - Right path? - Unlike your life. So, in your mind, you are a perfect mother. Giving Luna a false hope every day that his dad will come home someday. Is that correct? Do you think that's being a good mother? Why so quiet? No, I'm just... I'm just thinking. At least I have a child. Unlike you. You'll never have children, no matter how long you wait. Listen to me. Your mom told me everything. So no way... - Don't talk about it. - No. I'm not talking about it. You said you've told me everything? What have you told me? Why did I have to learn that from your mom? So now let's think. You think. If you can think, be mature a little, do you know why your mom died? - Don't you dare. - Your mom was stressed. Do you know who made her die? You know who? Have you ever thought, even once, who made your mom die? You evil witch! You're the most ungrateful woman I've ever met! No wonder Ryan left you! Mom, is it all because of me? The important thing is that this illness has been taken away from your body now. Everything has been taken away from me. Including my future. Now, there's only you and I. And I... will take care of you forever. La. Cha, where have you been? Why was it so hard to reach you? I'm sorry, La. I... Cha? What's wrong? Ryan left me. - Cha! - What are you doing? I was looking for you. Go. Cha! To the left! Come on, La! - Whose scooter is this? - Just put this on. Just put it on. Hurry up. By the way, where did you get this scooter? I rented it. - Rented it? - Yes. Where did you get the money? From selling my rings. Let's make a stop here. Right here. Hold my bag for me. The Achaia Stadion? The Achaia Stadion. Yes. This place is in Venice. Venice. Yes. Venice, not Verona. Venezia is Venice? You're welcome. Bye. But we still can go to Venice tomorrow. It will be really late if we go there now. Why don't we look for a hotel here? We don't have any money. You. After all we've been through, you want to give up just like that? My rings were expensive. Let's go. Here. We will get to Venice. I was right. This is so cool. Mom! Cha. Why did you get a ring tattoo on your finger? I got this tattoo while in Innsbruck. Well... because the ring was from my mom. A ring with a green emerald stone. Today is the day my mother passed away two years ago. But you were right. My mom's soul is not inside the ring. It's in me, inside my heart. It will remain there forever. I'm sorry. I know how much that ring meant to you. But now I have this. Rings can be lost. Tattoos can't. Well, they can be removed if we go to a highly skilled dermatologist to avoid leaving keloids. La. This is your wallet and passport. But I'm afraid your phone really fell out of the bag. How...? You mean I never lost them? Yes. I hid them from you. I mean I saved them. So you can truly feel what freedom is. What... how... I'm not following you. I mean when you have nothing left, it means you can't lose anything anymore. So you are free to do anything. What? Yeah. Nothing to lose! You have a weird theory. Why is it weird? I think it's really cool. You said, "If you lose everything." But I didn't lose everything. What? Now I'm the one confused. I didn't lose everything because I still have you. Oh my! What? Now that's weird. That's weird. I almost lost you, but I didn't. Silly. Come on, let's go. Venice. Hold on. You don't want to do something to commemorate it? - Come on, just go. - No, it's okay. Ryan can wait. What are you doing? I want to take a picture with my mom. Let me take the picture. One, two... Here. This is the proof that my mother and I have been here before. In the end, there's only me and mom. There. From here, it's left and then right, I think that's what she said. Left and... - It's here. - The place is there, right? - No. We go down and then take a right. - Oh, okay. - Cha, no. Let's just go. - What? - What's the matter? - It's... What is it now? Cha, what if you were right? What if it turns out Ryan already has another woman? And he's been sending me postcards and gifts for Luna just because he wants to be a good father, that's all. But not because... Not because he still loves me. Well, it's up to you. Do you prefer to live in your fantasies, in your dreams, predicting this and that about Ryan? Or would you rather climb the stairs, knock on his door, and face reality? Or maybe we should have lunch first? Go. - Cha... - Go. Go. We're here already. Go up there. I'll be here. - You're not coming? - Why should I? Come on. - Ryan! - Cha! Hurry up then! What's taking you so long? - La? What's happening? - Cha, let's get out of here. - No, no. This is not funny. - What's going on? You know I came here to see Ryan. - I seriously want to see Ryan. - Laura! - Yes, I know. - But this! Let's just get out of here. This is a joke! Come on, enough. Cha! - Hold on a second. - For what? Enough. Enough. No, no. Let's go. - Laura, just a second. - You know he's a liar. - La, hold on one second. - Cha, listen to me. - Listen to what he wants to say. - What is he trying to say? I don't know. Cha, you know he's been lying to us. - No, we don't know that. - Enough. Come on, let's go. - Let's just go home. - Come on. Cha, please tell me that he's lying. Cha, I came here to see Ryan, not for this! La, calm down, please. - Everything is gone. - La. I know, but you have to calm down. Please. Cha. Hello, honey. Finally, this message has reached you. I'm sorry for not having the courage to go back home. I don't want you to see me going through this difficult time. Because I don't have the courage to tell you and Luna that the man that you both love so dearly will have to go soon. I'm doing this because I love you and I don't want to see you sad. Please don't hate me for leaving you, Laura, because I never really left you and Luna. Until we meet again, I will be watching over you always. Okay, dear? I'll be protecting you. Protecting our love. Because that is the most beautiful thing I have ever had. And now, I want you to smile. Okay, honey? Just like me, who's now smiling, seeing you find me again. I think I feel better now. Are you sure? At least everything is clearer now. It's no longer blurry. It's not... It's not as dark as when Ryan just left me all of a sudden. I'm sorry, La. Sorry for what? For having negative thoughts about Ryan. When... when he left me, I really tried to call you. I called you so many times. But you didn't pick up, and I felt like I would go crazy. I was at the hospital that day. After my uterus was removed. I'm sorry, Cha. For what? For having negative thoughts about you. But it's all in the past. Cha, I want to go home. Yes. Let's go home.
