When I first saw Queen Victoria's painting kit, as a filmmaker and water color painter myself, I was really surprised to find out that a 150 years ago, she was an artist. Her great-great-great-grandson, his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, also enjoys painting. And for the first time on film, he agreed to tell me the extraordinary story of the traditional of art in his family through the ages. She was doing it in those days on her writing paper, more like I started. And in the search for the earliest evidence of art in the royal family, we'd discover literally dozens of talented artists. This is a series of wonderfully used water colors. Revealing an extraordinary treasure trove, creativity by royal hands. There you see, not quite spelled right-- "Napolean." We'll be finding out more about their art and what their art means to them. I think, you know, drawing from nature, observing nature is absolutely crucial. And I've obviously been inspired by just looking. It is usually the light is what captures my attention. You can look at the same view over and over again. Then suddenly, one moment there's the most magical light. And I sometimes paint in the evenings. And every now and then, it's-- when it dries suddenly, it is exactly what I was looking for. You think, how--how do you do those? Which part of me does it come from? And I was lucky enough to be brought up, you know, at Windsor Castle and Buckingham Palace and Balmoral. And of course, you imagine at Windsor, you're surrounded by the most marvelous things. Of course, when you were small, you rush about. You know, pedaling or something up and down the corridors along. And you notice nothing. It's just a background. Suddenly, literally, and I must have been 14 or something, suddenly all the pictures on the walls, I found just came into focus. Like, do you know what I mean? And they've just been a blurred sort of background so you just-- just that. Then suddenly, I started looking. Amongst this incredible collection of masterpieces, by artists like Canaletto and Rembrandt, we found art actually done by members of the royal family themselves. And we were given a very special guided tour. This old painting was done by my father, the Duke of Edinburgh when I was a child. It's of the Queen having breakfast in the private dining room here at-- at Windsor Castle. His father passed on this interest by showing the Prince of Wales how to paint when he was young. My father's paintings, like many by my forebears, were done for pleasure on public and private trips. This rarely seen liner cut of the circus horse was done by the queen when she was young. So the cut of the horse. Yes, she must have been sort of eight or nine, I suppose, or younger. But was done for-- for the-- for the parents. Like many of these things were done, you know, given to the parents at Christmas time or birthdays, those things. You know, like one does as a child. I remember doing it to my grandmother and others. Then we walk away and shuffle off our mortal code. But these-- these things live on. That's what's so riveting, I think, about looking at other members of my family in the past. There's this feeling that, you know, there they were, even sense them sitting doing the painting and everything else. And then that stays behind. It's still you. It's a part of you that's still there even though the rest of you is gone. We'll be looking through the Prince of Wales' family tree to see if there's evidence of an artistic inheritance. We'll start with the earliest remaining art you can find today. In the fight for the throne of England, Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned by Elizabeth I for nearly 20 years before being executed. With time on hands, it was in prison that her art was to flourish. I have the impression that Mary Queen of Scots' embroidery, which was an art. It-- fascinating the intricate and very uh-- thought out, you know, with these images. It was the first serious art in the royal family. The vine indicates that if you cut me down, further shoots will spring up, other branches, of other leaves. Because I have a son. I have a family, which will go and increase and multiply, and of course did go on, and sits on the throne of England today. So she got that one right. Another royal artistic did perfect their craft in prison, this time during the English Civil War, was the great grandson of Mary Queen of Scots, Prince Rupert of The Rhine. He lives at Windsor Castle nearly 400 years ago and was known for the special engraving method he pioneered called mezzotint. His inventive artistry survives here to this day and is much admired by the Prince of Wales. He was obviously incredibly skilled, don't you think? And you wonder whether he didn't do this as a result of what happened to his uncle. King Charles I. It's wonderful that these exist here and show, you know, what talent he had. If you imagine the scale of it is quite a-- a job doing a mezzotint like that. Coming from a long line of artists has inspired the Prince of Wales himself to draw and paint as a hobby whenever he, too, has time to spare. Although he's never had formal lessons, we were fortunate to be invited to accompany him to one of his most favorite haunts, a remote spot on the Balmoral Estate in Scotland. I think it was grandmother probably who inspired me to-- who encouraged me to look and observe. I think I must have been quite a-- a willing part of that um-- suggestion that I observe things. I wanted to-- to do more than just take photographs. To me, it didn't give me the same sense of-- of satisfaction somehow as actually trying to do it, you know, with-- with eye to hand to paper. I used to sit myself out on the hill. And then I'd try and sit and mix things. And it would rain. And everything went spotty. Then I thought, oh God. So them I eventually decided, years later that I'd do it all inside. So, I'd then do a sketch and put notes in, what the colors were and what-- where the sun was, all that stuff, which is actually incredibly good training. Because it makes you look much more carefully, I think, And try to train yourself to retain the thing in your mind. I love painting snowscapes. There's something awfully satisfying about trying to bring-- you know, make the white paper become snow. So you're doing everything in reverse. You know, putting in the-- the darker bits to try and create that-- that-- that same sort of feeling. And that one I did a-- I thought I did sketch for that. There we are. I found a sketch. Trying to make sense of that is always interesting when you come back. Now put a lot of color to so on that side. What I love about doing the snow scenes, and I always found that the-- the sky can be quite hard. But sometimes ah-- you get that a bit. It is rather wonderful at this time of year, I think, or January. Although the light on the snow, the shadows is-- is so exciting to do, I think. Over the years, a talent for art has surfaced again and again in the royal family. But is this genetic or do they traditionally choose to spend their time developing their artistic skills? The Prince of Wales is especially interested in the next artist he's going to show us. Arguably the most cultured monarch ever to sit on the throne of Great Britain. Four generations on from Prince Rupert of The Rhine, everybody's taught that King George III was the Mad King. But in the library at Windsor Castle are some of the most remarkable and beautiful treasures, which, I hope, will redress this simplistic view of him. King George III had instruction in drawing and particularly looking at architectural drawing as that was considered an important uh-- part of his education. I suppose all-- there are all these things he did were exercises in ah-- observation, perspective. He'd clearly developed his eye for buildings and you know, the whole issue of scale and proportion and everything. So clearly it was an interest that remained with him for the rest of his life. His interest in art and architecture led him to give his active support, and a very generous benefaction, to the Royal Academy of Arts. He was very much of his time, in fact, in the mid 18th century many more people of his ilk learned to draw, were encouraged to draw, were expect to draw as a recreation. I do think it's plausible that somebody who's very busy and exercised with issues of constitutional government, anxious about the French Revolution, might have decided that drawing a classical temple was a way of taking his mind off the rest of his life. He used this illustration of a-- a--a temple at Palmyra now in Syria. God knows what will happen. I pray, you know, they won't destroy this. Can you imagine if this wonderful thing of transposing that into a wonderful Sylvan landscape, you know, with the water and the boat on it. It's very interesting the way he's tamed the landscape. And also, it's very interested about the trees, the way he'd done them. Mm-hmm. And the work on the trees is remarkable. But they all-- I mean at that time, in the 18th century, there was a particular way of doing things. But it--it--it took an awful lot of effort. Because you had to use the pencil, little-- little sort of circles you see. And then smudge presumably. But very effective. The end of 1788 saw the onset of the first serious bout of the King's illness, now recognized as porphyria, which was extremely severe. I mean he's one of these people, I always felt anyway, had been much maligned by history. Now I was-- I discovered the other day that he was using products of his hair and things like that, which may have had arsenic in them. Because they've taken hairs from him, these hairs and-- and sent them to the-- to a laboratory and discovered the hair had extraordinary levels of arsenic. So it could be that the use of arsenic in some of these, I don't know, medications or something had, you know, made it even worse his delusions and his awful delirium and everything else that this poor man had to-- to go through. So, I mean, obviously the disease, the problem cause the most appalling pain and everything else. Of course it drives him mad. There are very few drawings by him after this date. The effect of the King's illness on the Queen and their much loved 15 children was cataclysmic. The normal process of marriage for the daughters was halted. Effectively leaving them in limbo with unlimited leisure time. They spent their hours botonizing studying flowers and plants at the family's artistic retreat, Frogmore House not far from Windsor. Princess Elizabeth was, I think, the most artistic, the most fun of the daughters who had a real spark for life. She learned how to do oils and watercolors. That's really good, the-- you know, the drops of water, leaves and things. And the bird's nest you see. Brilliant, the moss. When Elizabeth was finally married, she moved to Germany. And her art took another turn. She filled her time cutting out silhouettes, which she sent back to her sisters. These are-- I mean, they're beautifully cut out by Elizabeth using her scissors. And they could be used in all sorts of different decorative ways. So here, in these baluster strips, you have brown cut outs against black. Here you have a black cut out, which could be laid against white. As though I was just about to drop a child into a bucket, give it a wash or something. A lot of fun isn't it? This room is called the Charlotte Closet. And hanging in the room now are a wonderful series of drawing in the style of etchings done by Charlotte, a princess royal. The girls weren't the only creative members of the family. Their little brothers were taught art as well. These ones are by the Duke of Sussex and the Duke of Cumberland and they were small. Can you imagine, these were done at the age of nine or seven or something. Obviously it was a combined approach with the-- the teacher. Because, I mean, to achieve this sort of level of competence at that age would be very difficult, I think. But it's very good use of gouache isn't it? Isn't it? You get a lovely picture of them all being taught art. Yes. It's actually good. In the tradition of handing down. Well, exactly that, yeah. Yeah. In our search through the dozens of artists in the royal family tree, we came across an era bursting with creativity. Another very creative member of my family was my great-great-great-grandmother, Queen Victoria. She and her husband, Prince Albert, spent much of their private time at Osborn House on the Isle of White drawing and painting out of the public gaze. And many of the oil paintings by Queen Victoria are members of her family, still hang at Osborn House. They both are terribly aware of the importance of art. But for Victoria, I think it's more an emotional thing, an outlet for her emotion. And for Albert, it's much more of a sort of a duty thing. Like many of my forebears, Queen Victoria and Prince Albert had both been encouraged to draw as children. And they were very well taught. This intriguing sketch book was done by my great-great-great-grandfather, Prince Albert, age 12. It probably came over in his luggage from Germany. It's rather interesting. You see that he has a great eye in those sketches for soldiers. He's always looking, perhaps what princes are trained to look at, which is, you know, what medals you put on, what uniform you're wearing, and what ribbons and stripes. The just-- they're riveting. They're full of energy aren't they? They full of endless sort of disasters and military subjects. Marvellous idea is galloping that way and shooting somebody coming from behind. Gracious look at this. These horses are very good aren't they? Albert was a rather poetic, unusual character. And above all, he was interesting because he was a modernizer. And one of his passions was the idea of the reformed family. And I think he brought one of the most significant pedagogical ideas of the 19th century with him from Germany. And that is the idea of the kindergarten. Queen Victoria was very, very fortunate and quite actually, in some ways, unusual in having nine children within 17 years without losing any. She spent hours sketching them. This album, treasured by the royal family, gives us a unique insight into her as both artist and mother. Well, since you didn't have cameras, it was crucial to do this. Otherwise you had no records at all. The amazing thing is the time that they had. She was doing it those days on her writing paper, more like I started. I think those early sketch books are extremely interesting. The--the-- the pictures of the children. Um-- She-- she she-- she had a great-- great powers of observation. She was fascinated by people. She's drawing tender pictures of her own children. She scribbling portraits of the prime minister on her blotter, whatever it might be. But she obviously had a-- felt sort of tenderness for her children. I think these are so-- could have been those. It must have been at-- looks like Windsor to me. Adorable. Back views. Dressing up again. Here she was. That's Alfred. And they are such a-- a wonderful record this, I think. That's the um-Kaiser. Marvellous back room. Both Victoria and Albert insist that their children should have drawing and um-- painting um-- and handwriting too, sort of factored into their timetables, which is set up from a very early age, from the age of four. That was part of the accepted ah-- approach to bringing up children, making sure they had, you know, an adequate understanding of the arts. You're going to begin by using a wash, using a brush, um-- and then later on, you'll have a chance to use a line. So It might mean you've got layers of-- of wash and figures or layers of drawing and not just give it a sense of movement. Because it is a quick, amazing class. The Prince of Wales set up his drawing school in London with the idea of passing on the tradition of drawing just like Victorian's and the Georgian's have before him. Today, the school runs classes for all ages. I think what his Royal Highness is absolutely passionate about it is helping students see that art is something that is the most wonderful resource to feed off and to inspire them and to help them exercise their imaginative muscles. Because if you don't have that training, I suppose if you don't have the business of encouraging somebody to use their eye, then you miss an awful lot of the world around us. Queen Victoria's eldest son, my great, great grandfather, Lazy King Edward VII, was known as Bertie. His teacher did this thing of getting him to copy his-- and it is a funny way because you did a lot by-- by having to copy. So that's what happened, I think, in this case here with um-- Edward called, though, doing-- doing one and then my great, great grandfather doing the other. That didn't quite work. Obviously a bad day. It's quite difficult to be able to do that. Otherwise he gets quite good. There you see, not quite spelled right the "Napolean." Queen Victoria spent a lot of time in Scotland at her other retreat, Balmoral when nature and the elements were to further inspire her art. "At every turn, you have a picture. These Scotch streams, full of stones and clear as glass. They're most beautiful. The peeps between the trees. The depth of a shadow. The mossy stones mixed with slate. This mixture of wilderness and art is perfection." I mean, some of them are really remarkable, I think. Her-- her little water colors. And looking out of her window at Balmoral. That view, I know it so well, and it's so intriguing. And what I find so fascinating is how I have ended up doing the same sort of views. I've known it all my life, you know. I-- uh-- And I've been here since I-- before I could remember really. You know, inevitably it's-- it's home. And I have tramped across the hills endlessly for the last 60, well, 60 years. They become indelibly part of your life and your soul really. It's the lights on the landscape on the mountains and the shadows. That's the thing that really catches the-- the attention And it doesn't happen very often further off. You just suddenly get the right combination. And suddenly it's the dark and the light and the-- and the-- and the shapes, which are really what I think it's so important. It's obvious if I-- if I see something, I suddenly have to stop and try to remember, you know, as much as I can. Because it's a very good, I think, it's a very good exercise in observation. You have to try and imprint. And what about color? What-- what are you seeing in the colors? I can look. But everybody sees it slightly differently. Depends on the way you look at the world. But um-- yes, I mean, it's the-- it's then of course, I have-- the fun is thinking while you're looking at it. Now what paint colors am I going to use to create-- try to create that feeling? But I find that one of the most, I think, sometimes difficult colors to get is the color of the birch trees in the winter. And that's a January period. When they go-- they go purple. It's the most extraordinary things. The-- the bare branches. In the autumn, in October, a lot of the grass goes-- is orange color. It's quite extraordinary with the frost. And it is an amazing color. That gets quite exciting too, to try and make the-- the yellows and the oranges and the reds look-- look-- look believable in them. In 1861, Queen Victoria's husband, Albert, died. We discovered this had a dramatic effect on her arts. She retreated into widowhood for 40 years. And her paintbox became her solace in his absence. Literally thousands of her paintings remain as testament to this period or mourning. The tragic thing about all this, I think, is that these ones were all done after Prince Albert's death. And they'd always have things like the third year of my desolation in 1864. Each one says that first, second, third, fourth. Portraits of the children all but vanished. And instead, she painted empty landscapes. In the spirit of a real artist, Queen Victoria expressed her emotions through her art. Here's a--another one, October 1. Looking out of her window, up, up the Dee Valley. Wonderful stuff. What she used there are lots of burnt umber, do you think, and things like that. Prince Albert's death was to affect the art of Queen Victoria's sixth child, Princess Louise, as it had done her mother's. I spose she was only 12 or 13 or something. And so they were all encouraged to-- to do something like this, a drawing or a painting. So that's her with presumed dreaming of her parents reunited in heaven. I mean, she was quite young, you see, and these are remarkable, I think. I mean, she--she-- Princess Louise was, I mean, a seriously good artist. She had learned to draw and sketch as any um-- young Victorian lady would do. But Princess Louise found it very difficult trying to escape from the stifling attitude of her mother's that nothing should be done to interfere with Victoria's own mourning. Louise found an escape and found her own identity through following sculpture. There was less opposition to the idea of a woman becoming a sculptor then-- then there was to a woman doing other kinds of art. And that's possibly because sculpture is connected to monuments and to memorials. And so, this was an extension, if-- if you like, of the family respect that, you know, the descendant, the daughter, was showing to her line. Because Louise made a number of sculptures of her family. In 1893, she produced what properly is now her most well-known work, which is a statue of her mother seated as she was at the time of her coronation, which is today to be found in Kensington Gardens. She believed very strongly, also, in supporting women's work, their--their opportunities and opportunities to become professionals. She was a modern princess. What you get a picture of here is how the Vi-- the Victorian society as reflected by the ideals of the royal family, the ambitions of the royal family. Actually it made amateurishness quite professional. I mean, they didn't earn money from it. And of course, by-- heaven forbid, that an aristocratic should think of selling a picture. But if they did actually pursue it to a point in which they, you know, wanted to be as good, if you like, as a professional. These ones here are-- are by Queen Alexandra who was my great, great grandmother, and married my great, great grandfather, King Edward VII when he was Prince of Wales. And um-- clearly, while she was in Denmark as a child, she had some very good instruction. Incredibly competent. Look at that. She got the rocks. Really lovely. And to think she did it with this tiny little, do you see? That's all it was. Little tiny paintbox, a tiny brush. But she clearly had a very natural talent anyway. But They're fantastic. Well, there's this wonderful one of her mother-in-law, Queen Victoria. This is a marvellous figure isn't it? Must have been at Balmoral somewhere. It gives you a wonderful snapshot of life at Balmoral, doesn't it? Mm-hmm. This is a marvellous view of the River Dee near Aberdeen, which I know so well, painted by Queen Alexandra. Extraordinary. So that must be Loch Muick where we were. Exactly. Mm-hmm. That's it. The Prince of Wales' artistic roots are not just on the maternal side. He was really keen to trace back his father's family line. And in our journey, we discovered an astonishing revelation. A Naval commander who could easily have been a professional artist. My father's grandfather, my great grandfather, Prince Louis of Battenberg was remarkable in what he could do. I - hadn't really fully appreciated what a great artist my grandfather was. He actually had his uh-- work, his-- his sketches of the moon. Sketches ah-- done while he was a accompanying my great, great grandfather, King Louis VII on his-- his tour of India in the-- in 1875 I think it was. And the things he did of-- of that tour were accepted by the Illustrated London News. And you had to be unbelievably good and competent to get into that. So he was a-- he was again extraordinary. COUNTESS MOUNTBATTEN OF BURMA: My grandfather probably inherited quite a bit of it too. Because I gather his father also, Prince Alexander. uh-- had been an artist as well. And of course, one has to remember in those days, either you drew everything or there was nothing to show people what the experiences were that you'd been through. All these wonderful drawings that he did on that tour, which he took over from the artist who became ill. "His Royal Highness often received jewels and pearls for his wife of fabulous value and on which some maharajah's spent a whole years' income. Live animals were often included. On one occasion, a full-grown tiger was led in by four powerful men, two holding the collar around the animal's neck and the others around the loins. The beast nearly trod on my toes. Gave me rather a start. On the way home, I made a number of sketches of the different animals and incidents in connection with them. Most comical. I sent them to the Illustrated London News. And in due course, they nearly filled a copy of the paper. I made quite a lot of money. And I was elected honorary member of the Institute of Painters in Watercolor." Ah, that was it. The ostrich. But he's brilliantly done. He must have had hysterics trying to get ostrich up the steps. His feathers coming out. They're having a terrible time. I do hope the poor bird didn't suffer. Poor creature. And I believe these were destined for the zoo. I wonder how long they survived in the zoo. Sometimes you do tend to be given very extraordinary things. I was given a Russian bear by Khrushchev and Bulgarnin in 1955 when they came on a visit. That had to go straight to the zoo. And the other, when was it? A few years ago, we were in Pakistan, right up in the north of Pakistan. I was given the most beautiful shampooed, male yak, which was led up looking fantastic. It was sad I couldn't take it back. Because I didn't think it would fit in the crate of something. Anyway, I had to leave it behind. It would have been rather fun to have brought a yak back and kept it at Highgrove. That's extraordinary. What was he doing being carried on a sort of what is a palanquin or something. Like his forebears, the artist Prince Louis and the Prince of Wales 150 years ago, the busy life of the heir to the throne involves a lot of travelling around the world in the glare of the public eye. Although is more than 15 and 1/2 thousand kilometers from London and I'm so jet lagged that I feel a few sausages short of a bar-b. It is a great joy to be back here in Australia again. And we are incredibly touched by the warm welcome you've given us both. For keen artists like the Prince of Wales, these hot and exotic destinations provide much artistic inspiration. But increasingly his busy schedule doesn't include painting. So he invites an unpaid artist to accompany him. I - decided back in 1985, I think it was, I'd take an artist with me on every official visit overseas. So I've been doing this for quite a long time. It going to be amusing, I hope, for one or two people in years to come possibly. Ah--the results of that. The fact that an artist is around I find very enjoyable. I enjoy artists. It-- it really was a surprise, a pleasant surprise, when I was asked to go along on this tour of Australia with him. I think a painting is actually so much more fascinating in posterity terms than sometimes photographs. And so that's why I take them and also because he keeps the tradition of the royal collection going. Well done, Warwick. Thank you Sir. You could do anything. Thank you, yes. Don't want to have a paint? No. No. I'll leave you to that one. You found a very good spot. It's beautiful, in the shade, grand view. What more could you want? And you've got the expert looking over your shoulder. We've got all that food to pick up too. Oh. I'm dying for that. That's terrific. Yeah, it's a start. Thank you though. Well done. Although prints do take an artist, he may not get as complete a record of the places he's been, he'll get more meaningful work from the--from an artist, one would hope. My problem, as you can imagine, on these overseas expeditions, on the official ones, I haven't got time. So I do little sketches. And then I will do them when I get back. In Oman, we're-- we're-- we're put in the desert and just given an hour, let's say, to paint. So I painted him painting the desert. So much the time he's on duty. And paining allows him a little time for quiet reflection and also a bit of an investigation of things at a-- at a deeper level than his whirlwind existence normally allows. Painting like this is--is is almost meditative in the sense that you-- you enter another world. It's most extraordinary. Everything else is excluded. And you become so absorbed, I suppose the meditation is concentration really. And then coming out of it is like coming out from, you know, like drawing a curtain and being dragged back into the real world. I think it's very important to--to-- to realize that people however much they have to spend their life in the public eye, do have a bit of private time and the sort of things that interest them. I think Prince Charles has-- has developed enormously, of course, as an artist. And it's always nice to discover the you, ah-- perhaps inherited something from earlier generations, which ah-- I've no doubt he has. This is um-- Huna Mill near John O'Groats. It's the most wonderful place. You develop a-- a system after a bit and the same thing with the colors. I tend to have the, you know, the same sort of colors I've learned and the whole bit how you mix them and what produces what. The great thing, you know, after a bit is you begin to realize that something like this will look much better further away. So as you come away from it. Actually at about 100 yards, it'd look quite good. It's a quality of soulfulness, I think, that you bring to it. And that's, I think, what the Prince has as well as a sense of discipline. He has in all aspects of his life, it seems. He's interested in things beyond the surface. He's interested in the enduring qualities of things. That is Morocco. I think I did that. I nearly missed the aeroplane as a result. Because I was-- I could-- I wanted to finish. Um-- And, of course, the problem with sitting outside in those hot countries is your water evaporates if you're not careful. Mm-hmm. Those two are the Selous Game Reserve in Tanzania. Well, there was a terrific amount of rain. Everything had flooded. But, again, I was quite please with it. Because it-- it has this incredibly humid hot feel to it, I think. That's the Serengeti. um-- But the best time of day really is-- is 6 o'clock on, good two hours. And, I don't know, if you get up early enough in the morning, 6 o'clock in the morning, at this time of the year is fantastic. Mm-hmm. But I'm not-- I can't-- I don't want to paint in the middle of the day. It just hopeless. Doesn't inspire you, does it? Well, it's got no shadow, no contrast. It's-- it's a funny way. Well, the cypress trees are -- Tuscanny I think. Inspiring aren't they? Yeah. And the fun was, just you know, outline, highlighting, just the light on the-- on the-- on the edge of the cypress trees. Again, in the evening, because again it was the shadows coming down from that wooded hill, which I thought was so special. By looking at his art, we've been shown another side to the Prince of Wales. Inspired by his forebears, he enjoys spending his spare time painting for pleasure. But he's not the only member of the present generation of the royal family who produces art. Our journey has brought us to the Queen's niece, Sarah Armstrong Jones, a professional artist whose also been inspired by her family. My mother was very creative and artistic, had a-- an amazing brain. And my father is a photographer so I think I was in a very creative family background. When she was little, she was surrounded by all these beautiful paintings and things. And I think she wanted to pass it on down to my brother and me. Sarah now jostles for her position in today's busy contemporary art world. I - think it's very important to set up with a gallery and to have somebody to represent you. And I'm very lucky to have that in a position that I am now. Hello. Hello Sarah. Hi. How are you? Not bad. Hi Richard. Hi Paul. Everything arrive OK? Yeah. Just getting there. We're just moving and placing things. We don't-- don't show them anonymously at art fairs. So her name's on there. And people sometimes make the connection. And they'll say, oh is that Princess Margaret's daughter. And we say, yeah. Yeah. We thought the gouaches probably in the corridor. Good idea. Would you hang them in one long line. Yeah. Yeah. Just as you come down. We don't make any special concession for-- for her background at all. So our main criteria is the strength of the work and how they exhibitions work. Turned out very well, isn't it? Yeah. It's a good one. She's more experimental than some of the other artists that we show. She's really pushing herself. So she's very much a professional artist and totally dedicated the that activity. The drawings are based from nature. But it's just on a larger scale. Because I'm interested to see the pencil line on a larger scale. And sometimes those fit into the oil paintings. One day, um-- I liked what was happening. I think I was trying to experiment a bit using my drawings much more and my water colors, trying to combine the two. Quite liked what was going on. So I'm developing on those paintings now. I'm try and remember all the colors as much as I can. But I use my reference from the things that I've picked out in the landscape. When we set out on this journey, we didn't know what we would uncover. But looking behind the public face at the British Monarchy, we found, in the royal family, a real commitment to art generation after generation. Each inheriting an appreciation of what practicing art can bring. And also the importance of handing it down. I think there's an artistic gene running through your family that you've inherited. It must come down. You know, I hope it-- I hope we can pass it down to the next generation. We'll see what comes out of it. My guess is that most families, you know, have people who could do it if they really wanted to. But like all these things, you see, it demonstrates the importance of being introduced at a young age to appreciate things and to look and observe. With such a strong creative tradition, who knows who the next royal artist will be.
