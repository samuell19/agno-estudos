(Car running noise) (Announcement) Tasaka Sangyo Tasaka Sangyo Please turn the president's car to the front door (Engine sound) (Gunshot) (Tire squeal) (Male) How are you! ♪～ (Haraguchi) It's a cute guy Never miss the aim If you can- I wanted to get into that Tasaka bank It's not a command from the president Tasaka bastard Nowadays, I'm trembling That's exactly what the president calculated. ～♪ (Sound of pulling the side brake) (Toru Katsumata) Get off here What did you say? Don't go back to the office Tohru What are you going to do I was going to wash my feet from the beginning with this job Do you think that is allowed? You're betraying the president, can you live? I know I've already decided I can't change my feelings anymore This kind of work that I didn't like My decision hasn't changed. Say hello to the president. Try to run away, I'll kill you Are you going to shoot in such a place? Shit ... (Bird bark) (Telephone ringtone) (Koichi Katsumata) Oh Did Tohru escape? Don't say stupid guys Wash your feet ... Did you really say that? Okay, go right away (Misa) What's wrong? Let's go out Tohru's guy said it was hard after work (Misa) Toru-san? Stupid guy How much care do you have to take care of Don't forget to feed this guy (Ohara) This was the first big job for the president in a long time. Well, everyone knows that Speaking of Tasaka industry It ’s one of the top five companies in the construction industry. President Tasaka is also known for having a deep connection with the political world. That Tasaka This time about the Toshin bullet road laying work Let the big names in politics grab a huge amount of money and buy the officials of that source Well, in other words, it's the one who bribes over the usual interests. But this time corruption is a bit different Well, that's where the president was noticed. I had a lot of trouble Finally I got the photo document tape Shake Tasaka with this guy as a story It was a size that a lot of money would roll into our company However Tasaka is also advised by Honma of the Giseikai. It's not straightforward I'm not talking about this because of crap and madness I have to let you know- He also has to make a sound So I let Haraguchi do a job. Up to this point, it was as calculated by the president. However At some point, a calculation error came out. Katsumata Tohru is your brother I think the president and we also took a lot of time to do it. (Executive) If you wash your feet, wash them and say through the muscles- I don't even know the president I managed it like this First, I can't show it to others Right? Katsumata I'm sorry (Ohara) Even if you apologize, I can't help it. Did Tohru say something? But he might be seeing his face at work tonight If Toru is mentioned in Satsu Cracks even in big work That's not all If you're not good at it, it could be fatal to the president. That guy is the president It's not the kind of guy who talks to Satsu (Yamazaki) To confirm that- Isn't it the first thing to find him? Find Toru Be sure to bring me Haa (Bird bark) (Car running noise) (Goro Katsumata) It's been a while, big brother (Koichi) Goro Let the president know that you are back You can't do it for free Don't forget the president four years ago The gambling house is ruined Put your hands on the territory Because I made a lot of trouble and shielded the group Not a joke For the work that I and Kuroda were doing It was Yamazaki who cut in from the side. The president doesn't think so What you couldn't do at that time Because I stretched my body and talked to the president Otherwise you're about this time ... Thank you, I'm so happy that I'm crying Goro (Goro) Kuroda Don't you know what you're doing? (Koichi) Are you going to meet? (Goro) Oh Because I'm the only friend (Koichi) Are you going to stay in Tokyo? Don't accept your brother's instructions Well to you who think of your younger brother Thank you for using it. (Kuroda) How about this? (Customer) Show it It's done well, isn't it? Oi Goro ... (Customer) Hey, look at this Isn't it Goro? This stupid guy ... hahaha I walked around for four years without any noise. (Kuroda) Come on (Goro) Let's go (Goro) I don't think you're in a store like this (Kuroda) What a tentative figure that endures the world And what When I run a store like this, I get a lot of material I'm not inconvenienced Yoo Yes? Do you know anything about this? cheek… It's true that you should pay attention to this mountain Goro After all it seems Oh, the mastermind is Yamazaki This guy built a big building I'm stubborn Behind the scenes, it's dingy. To that squirrel Toru's bastard was used for the gun ball Do you care? Ah (Toru) Didn't you see a strange guy? (Reiko) Yeah Ah… (whistle) It's a dirty sea Not just the sea, everything is dirty I was born and raised here Join the group and get up I wasn't going to come back again There is no place to hide only such a place in case of emergency What to do? from now on Run away where? What if I go to the police? No If you do that Because there's no way to escape anywhere And even money ... I want to go far ... Beyond the sea ... somewhere far away Beyond the sea ... If you have money You can get rid of such a dingy place Who? Big brother Are you going over the sea? Isn't it a good story? It's okay, this is my big brother Not a group of people I heard the story Do you think you can run away? Run away The guys from the Yamazaki group are desperate I was hiding in a place like this I can't find it Sweet candy Over there There is another person who grew up here Is it your scale? Really Did you feel like washing your feet? It's a story that makes you cry Do you know my feelings to my big brother? I don't know If you wash your feet, why did you join the group? Hana Mishita like you The end of being used like a poi is poi It's decided from the beginning ... I wanted money I wanted to eat delicious food So why don't you want to be a yakuza? But Get acquainted with this guy I feel crazy I felt like there was another way of life I thought I could try again I didn't like the yakuza Huh ... It's a sweet story It doesn't matter to you What did you come to here Toru Do you know Kuroda a man? Go to that place Will hide What happened? Can't you trust me? I can't do it Something about me I never thought about it, why did you Well, no matter what you think of me I don't think I have much time (Horn) (Murata) Smell (Koichi) Over there (Goro) I met you again A great person like you What is it for such a dingy place? What are you doing here? I miss my hometown Piss smell I can't stand this smell (Toru) Get it fast (Reiko) Oh ... Ah ... hahaha ... (Sound of air coming out) (Reiko) Ahaha ... Ahaha ... (Goro) Are you looking for something? (Koichi) Where did Tohru go? (Goro) Toru? I don't know Where did you escape? What do you do when you hear it? Keep it hidden in the group until it cools down Is it to the bottom of the ground? If it's Yamazaki's order, you've come to anything. Hey big brother Don't you miss Tohru? He's really trying to wash his feet right now Let me do whatever you want No I'm saying for Toru Think about it I can't do anything that he can do after washing his feet. I don't know So why don't you let me do it? Hmm At best, it ’s a punch line to be a stray dog. what? You see How much are you in your pocket right now? I have a lot of money in my wallet I am I don't want to make Toru look like you There is a tradition of the group in the group (Goro) What is the convention? Just say delicious things After all, my neck is in danger, so why not take Toru home? (Murata) Hey this bastard Uruse this bastard (Boy 1) Hey, do it fast (Boy 2) Chikusho (Boy 3) Alright ... That's it (Boy 2) Lift Yoisho Yoisho (Boys) Fufufu ... (Murata) Ugh! (Matsui) Wow! (Koichi) Stop Goro Are you planning to sell fights to Yamazaki-gumi? (Goro) What would you do?

Where and when come out! I'll kill you Who do you think we are? I'm back Why did you understand 4 years ago… Why didn't you keep silent to me? Did you have a grudge? I can't help saying anything now I've been waiting for you but… It's hard to wait for something that isn't right Ah ... you haven't changed at all The place where I keep silent like that is the same as before I got married The other party is your brother You're gone I was lonely alone, I'm sure It's been the case since I was born I was tired of being alone Maybe anyone was good If you don't leave me alone Give me a cigarette that person… He was very kind I loved you It's been two years now I'm doing well An average couple Why do you tell me that I don't know perhaps… Maybe it's because I want to get rid of my feelings But no I can't get rid of it What about you? How do you feel? My feelings? I don't know 4 years away from Tokyo Didn't you think of me? Until now I forgot Yes (knock) Who (Goro) It's me (Train running noise) Sleep a little I'm not sleepy I have to rest You're not a normal body I wonder if we can really give birth to a baby In such a state (Toru) Say stupid I can give birth It's impossible I'm being chased by the Yamazaki group and the police. I'll be chased for the rest of my life I don't want to give birth to a baby What a normal human does We also have such a house I don't have money be I have a guess Get money Not a lie Hehe ...

Raise Tasaka It's in the safe of the president's office where Yamazaki shook Tasaka. Take it away and this time I'll raise Tasaka Tasaka's guy It's wrong to be bullish in the last sniper case.
