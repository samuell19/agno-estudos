Apparently, it's bustling, too. What's Safe Haven? A small community near the foothills of Ferguson. A lot of people there, looking for more to come who want a fresh start.

I'll tend to your feet while Bo explains stuff to you. I want you to take this too and keep it with you at all times. Read it when you get a chance. A Bible? I think is the most powerful weapon we have on Earth. You once asked me how people have hope in this world that we live in. That's what you're going to find that hope. I don't know, Bo, I-- Look, I've never been to church. I-- I-- I probably wouldn't understand any of it. If you don't want it, you can give it to the Illumis. I'm sure they'll make use of it. Who are they? A group, nihilist to a fault. They're using this crisis to try to destroy all evidence of religion within our society. They believe it's the cause of our misfortune. They go around killing mercilessly. Looking for anybody with any type of religious texts. Qurans, Torahs, but especially the Bible. And they despise the name of Jesus. Why do they hate this Jesus character? Look, it's best that you read that in that book. It'll explain a lot. So eat up, rest. Tomorrow, we start training.

He was raised in a Catholic family and when the virus hit and killed his parents, Blake turned from God. Said he wanted nothing to do with the creator who would allow his creation to suffer indiscriminately. I kind of see his point. Look, I'm a believer, too. But, I also pondered the same question. Why would our God allow something like a virus to just wipe away everyone? But, read that book. It'll help you understand what we believe more.

My dad, he, uh... he had this target in the backyard. Kind of showed us how to use it 'til I got good at it. It's really the only recreational thing we ever did. So, I take it your family wasn't churchgoing that much? My mom was. My dad, he, uh... he always chose to stay behind. And I chose to stay with him, despite my mom's objections. [Billy sighing] My wife was a believer. She begged me to go to church. But, I always had the same excuse. Too busy. I could tell it hurt her. But... But, I guess it doesn't really matter now that she's dead. See this where you're wrong, Billy. It makes all the difference in the world. It can be the difference between your soul going to heaven, or to that other place. Hell? Yes. Hell. My friend. I think we're living in hell right now.

But there's one thing that is still the same and will remain so today and forever. And that's the eternal love of our divine creator. Now, some of you may be asking, "Why did God allow this to happen? Well, why did so many people have to die?" I don't have all the answers for that. but I do have one answer, and that's this.
