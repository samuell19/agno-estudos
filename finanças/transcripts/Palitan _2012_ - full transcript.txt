--== McEphie ==-- For latest releases visit moviesnipipay website Good morning to you, our grooms and brides-to-be. Welcome to our Pre-Wedding Seminar. Marriage isn’t like rice that we can spit out when it’s too hot. You often hear that marriage means you are being bound to the one you love. Do you agree with this? Can someone tell me what he thinks of the words ‘to dedicate oneself’? I think it means giving your time and yourself to someone. Okay. We see the importance of marriage to Jesus. If Jesus values marriage, it means He wants us to honor marriage. In conclusion, Jesus' stand about marriage when the Jews asked Him: Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for whatever reason? Christ answered: have you not read, “At the beginning, the creator made them male and female…" Here are our requirements: Certificate of No Marriage, birth and baptismal certificates. Let me check. Birth certificate... All good. Thank you. Thank you. Let's go. There? - How's the fit? - It's beautiful. - Are you sure it’s not too tight? - Not really. - Tighter? - Yes. That’s alright. Are you okay with this length? Or you want the train longer? Not too long so I can walk comfortably. Let me see. How about this kind of applique? It’s okay, the design’s intricate. If you want, we can extend until the hemline. Right? You know, just up to here. Only if you want it. - It’s lovely. - Babe? What do you think of this? It's better if your shoulders aren’t exposed? How about some sleeves? Babe, just let me choose the design I’ll be wearing. It's my gown anyway. Okay. But it’s also beautiful. I agree, but that’s not within the budget. That's more expensive. So what’s your budget? Don’t ask. Whatever design I give you, that’s my budget. Okay? Come on, for old time's sake. Your future wife is so lovely. Wow, that's sweet! - Hi Reyn! - Hi. Excuse me, may I borrow this one. I’ll attend to them. - Hon, follow me. - Look, here. That’ll look good on you. I think it’s okay. Help me change. They might hear us. - This one... - That looks good too. It suits you. You’re really getting hitched? Why don’t you wear gowns? - Stop that. - Filipiniana. Mind your own business. Shirt length is 28. Can we make it a bit longer? 28 is good. Let's make it longer, please. And more loose, so it's easier to move. Babe? What? I’m excited to see my gown. I’m sure it’ll be beautiful on you. The design was just right for me. Of course, everything looks good on you. Oh, you flatter me so. No, really. Of course! You go first. Quick, it’s drizzling. Hurry up! Ma’am Leni! Jana! Jen! - Hi! - Hello! Hi. Al’s with me. - Hello. - Where's the gown? It’s ready. Look, it’s beautiful. Wow! This is it! It’s beautiful. Awesome! Let’s play, Aaron. Are you sure this fits? Of course. Very nice. - Are you sure? - Yes, but because of superstition... I know. I can't try it on. - It shows too much cleavage. - No. - I hope it fits. - Don't worry, I took your exact measurement. What about the rest? It’s mostly here, the gowns, the barong for the men. - Okay. - I’m still doing the ring bearer’s suit. Alright. It fits perfectly. I think so too. It's beautiful. You have nothing to worry about. Let's put it in the box. By the way, how much is the balance? Fifteen thousand pesos. Okay. - Help us take this off. - Sure. I’m so excited to wear this. I gave extra effort in making this so it’ll be perfect on you. Okay, let’s put it in the box. We’ll go ahead. Here’s the balance. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Thank you very much. Jasper! Thank you. Good morning. Come in! Good morning. Good morning, thank you. Come on. Hi, Aunt. - Hi, Aunt. - Your timing’s perfect. Hi. - How's the fitting? - That looks delicious. It is. Hi Aunt, how’s it going? I’ve just finished cooking, sit down and eat. Taste this. - She wants to know how the fitting went. - How was it? It was fine... ...delicious! Oh! I mean... it fits perfectly. And this food’s yummy. This is delicious. She enjoyed the fitting. Let's eat. But we’ve just eaten, Aunt. Then eat again. I'm still full. We can’t refuse. Don’t go on a diet, you’re skinny already. The gown might not fit. It’ll fit. You’ll still have a last fitting, right? Before the wedding? I cooked a lot of mechado so you can bring some to your future in-laws. So they’ll like you instantly. Good thinking, Aunt. Thank you. When you get to the countryside, try on your maid-of-honor dress. This is really delicious. Make sure the wedding date is already set before you come back. Yes, I’ll take care of it, don’t worry. Ask them when we can formally ask for Jen’s hand in marriage. - Just so I can prepare for it. - Of course. Babe, give me a hand. Take this. You go first. Lei, help Al. Aunt! Brother Em, please carry this. Yes, this is the gown. - How are you, Al? - I’m good. Is Meg here already? Mother! Father! Hey, Marie! - You have the rings? - Yes. - Hi Al! - Place it over there. Put the boxes there. Wow! You’re really ready for the wedding. Go to the room first. Let me see the rings. Hey! Get inside, you two. Which do you prefer? This one, it’s two-toned. Marie and Al. This one’s lovely. - This one’s nice too. - Mother, look! It’s perfect on my finger. - It’s loose. - How about this one? It’s too big. It’s still too big. Don’t you have the right size? Don’t you have anything that fits Al? I’ve brought other rings. - This has a stone. - Great! It’s white gold. - Try this ring. - Let me try that. Maybe it’s also big like the other? It doesn’t fit either. - Babe, look at this. - Do you have smaller size? I’m sure Meg has other rings. Beautiful. Doesn’t this look better, Ma? Al’s ring still doesn’t fit. Too bad, this is nice. The ring must be the exact size, that won’t do. The size of the ring is important. Do you have a smaller size? Alright, I’ll come back later. Alright. - Okay, come back later. - Yeah, so it'll be snug. It shouldn’t be big, they might lose it. That's right! The rings should fit the bride and groom perfectly. Am I right? They might lose it, that’s ten thousand. - Alright, I’m going. - Have you eaten? I’m cooking chicken soup. Really? But I have to go. I must meet another client. Not even a snack? Okay, I’ll just bring this with me. Thanks! Marie, Al, Father, Mother. - I'll go ahead. - Meg, thank you. Get some more! Congratulations! This one is enough. - Thank you! - Alright. Thank you Meg. The last ring’s okay, right? It looks fine, but Al needs a tighter ring. Meg will return with the other rings, don’t worry. Just a size smaller and it’s good. Let me do it. Did you pack everything? James, hurry up... - Yes. - there might be traffic. Coming... - Alright. - Perfect! - I’ll take care of it. - Jasper! Please help them with their bags. Sure. Thank you! Let me carry it. Thank you. Be careful on the road. Don’t drive too fast. I won’t. Text me when you get there. Will do. Thank you very much. - Enjoy yourselves. - We will. Goodbye. Take care. Remember what I told you. Take care, too. Jasper, you take care of the house. Okay. Have a safe trip. Thanks. - Don’t forget. - Yes. Set the date. Send me a picture if your gown fits, okay? - Bye! - Bye Aunt! Close the gate. Goodbye! I missed this place. It’s beautiful here. But the weather’s bipolar, the rain’s pouring hard a while ago, now the sun’s blazing. It’s like that here. You can’t predict the weather. Anyway, Babe… what’s your father like? I’m nervous. Don’t worry. He’s nice. Just a bit strict, and overly religious. - Very religious? - Yes. I hope he doesn't ask me to pray. Don't be silly. We’re here. It’s rainy here. I know. Babe? Babe? Meg’s here. - Come in. - Good afternoon. - How’s it going? - Good afternoon. Eat with us. She brought the rings. Really? Alright, try these on. Where’s Mother Lourdes? In the kitchen, preparing snacks. You’re here. Marie, try this ring. Try this. Finally. - This is nice. - Marie.. - This looks good, brother. - Beautiful. This is not the ring I want. Marie, the one you like is expensive. Ten thousand pesos. Lovely ring. How much is this? This one’s five thousand pesos. But the ring that Marie likes costs ten thousand pesos. But the five thousand ring looks better. - I think this is okay. - I like the simple design. Do you like it, Marie? It's okay. It’s beautiful too, right? Right, Babe? Is that okay with you? I’d rather have this ring. - It's simple. - Yes. - Let's eat. - Okay. Have a snack first. Anyway, son, what about the expenses at the wedding shop? Wedding shop? Have you paid for the gowns in full? I’ve settled everything there, Mother. What about the catering? The catering? Well... I’ll make an initial payment. A downpayment. We still need to pay them twenty-five thousand pesos. How much money do we still have right now? We need twenty-five thousand pesos more. We can sell one of our cows. But Father, those are mine. I’ll only sell the male cow. Is that so? Don’t worry about it. I must be off now. Do you want to go with me? No, I’ll go home later. I’ll take her home. - Alright then, I’m going. - Thank you, Meg. - Thanks for the food. - Thank you. Sit down, Mother. Son, how do you feel? I'm excited. Because it’s so close. What do you think, Father? I’m excited too. Marie should be the one who’s really excited. - Hi Jen! How are you? - Hi? Where’s Randy? - Is that you, Jen? - Help us with the luggage, please. Come, help me. Let’s get Jen’s bags. - Hi, Danny, how are you? - How are you? Good morning. Looking fresh. Thank you. I brought my boyfriend along. - This is James. - Good Morning. Come, meet my father. Father? - Yes, Jen? - Father, we're here. Bless me. - James? - Good morning. Put your luggages inside. Greet your Aunt Jen. Joy, Rolly, Jen’s here. How's your travel? - Have you greeted your Aunt Jen? - They already have. Come on. Hello Aunt Ninay and Lisa? How are you? Let's eat. - Come on. - Wash your hands. Let me help you. Just sit down, I know you're tired. You first. Father, let's eat. James brought something. This is my Aunt’s specialty, she cooked this for you. - What's this? - Beef stew. That’s delicious. You traveled for hours, it’s not spoiled yet? Still good. Thank you. Make sure you eat a lot. You eat your vegetables. Let's eat. You keep filling your plate, can you finish all of that? You brat! Noah. You should not waste food. You cannot leave this table until you finish everything on your plate. Finish that. Rascals! Can I have more rice? The bowl’s empty, Father. Rizalito! - Hey! - Friend! Your goddaughter’s here. Pretty, isn’t she. And is about to be married to this man, James. - How are you, godfather? - Hey, I’m fine. - You’ve grown into a beautiful woman. - Thank you very much. Good morning, sir. You know, James, this land’s been cared for by my forefathers. My father... then me. Thank God our boss Dennis trusted us, and gave us six hectares. Good land, isn’t it. But you know I only have daughters, and a man is needed to manage the six hectares, and sir Dennis’ land too. You see how important it is that Jen has a man to help her. Let’s go. - Be careful, it’s slippery. - Okay. Slowly, Father. Just follow me. We’ll walk further. Wait a bit. Babe, you want more? That’s not ripe yet! - How about this one? - Still unripe. - Hang on tight, you might fall. - This tastes nice. Eat it. Come down, Em. - This? - Still unripe. - This? - Yes, that’s ripe enough. Aunt! Uncle! - Hi, Jen. How's your trip? - You've grown so much. How are you? Em! How are you all? - Good morning. - You’re tall now! - How was the drive, Jen? - Marie! It was okay. How are you? Move the bench, child. Your house is cemented already, Uncle. It’s not finished yet, the window and the doors aren’t fixed yet. If I get more funds, it’ll look nicer. Anyway, this is James, my boyfriend. Hi. I’m James. I’m Al. I’ll get the snacks. I’ll just go help Marie. Wait here, James, alright? Hey Diana, pick these up. Bro, you can sit there. Alright, thank you. How’s life in Manila? It’s okay, but of course Manila can be so chaotic. Excited to get hitched? Definitely. - Congratulations brother. - Thank you. How are you, Marie? Nervous. Don’t be. I’m here already. Would you like to try on your gown now? Yes. We will, after a while. Carry that outside, that too. Wow! That’s beautiful, Marie! Wait a second. Jen will just try on her gown, alright? How elegant. Wear it, see how it fits you. Slowly. You’ve kept the shoes. Because they're important to me. It’s beautiful, Marie. It fits you perfectly. I love it. Hail Mary full of grace, the Lord is with you. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Pray with us. Hail Mary full of grace, the Lord is with you. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Hail Mary full of grace, the Lord is with you. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. Good night, take care. - Thank you, Brother. - Thank you. We’ll go to our room now, Father. We’ll rest now. James, sleep in that room, on the right. But Father, our bags are in that room. Then transfer them to the other room. Father, in Manila we sleep in the same room. Not here. Alright then. Good night. Brother, the other one looks better. No, fuschia pink gown is better for her. I want the mint green. Now, don’t argue anymore. Both gowns look pretty. Your sister is beautiful so whatever she wears will look good on her. - Jen, you’re here! - Hey, come. Where’s Marie? In the house. Jen! Wait, I’ll just prepare the barongs. Lei! Diana! - Give me a hand here. - Help your big sister prepare the things. - Here, drink water. - Thanks. So Al… Marie’s in your hands now. Take care of her, okay? Of course. You’re the one who didn’t care enough. Shall we go? It’s all here. I’ll just bring this to the car, wait for me. Goodbye. We’ll go now. Your sister and I are going now, okay. Get inside, don’t play under the sun. Goodbye. - We’re all set? - Yes. Let's go. Tipang sure has changed a lot. She’s a flight attendant now. It’s good that she can come back for our wedding. She better be there too when James and I tie the knot. - You’re okay, Bro? - Yeah. Mama Hai! Yes? Hi, Mama Hai! - So, what do you need? - Hi, Ma! Is that you, Jen? You’re so feminine now. Come, give me a kiss. And who’s this handsome man with you? - My boyfriend, James. - Good afternoon. I’m James. Hi, James. So how may I serve you, ladies? Tipang’s here, isn’t she. Yes, at the back doing her Facebook thing. There’s no signal here. I have brought her gown, she must try it on. Tipang! - Wait, we’ll just put the box inside. - Just put that there. Tipang! My girl, you have beautiful visitors looking for you, quick! - She's here! Quick! - Tipang! - How are you? - Tipang! I missed you so much! - Look how pretty these girls are. - Tipang! How are you? I missed you so much! Girls, I'm sure you have a lot to talk about. Goodbye, pretty things! Sit, sit. What's up? I’m doing great. Who’s he? Who is he? He’s James, my boyfriend. - Your boyfriend? - Yes. Did I hear that right? Can I date your brother? I’m an only child. - Tipang, really. - My apologies. Don't you have a boyfriend now, Tipang? Nope. But really, why's the wedding motif peach? Why not red? Isn't red your special color? Remember that red... It's still in the box. That’s was ages ago! That's a long time ago, Tipang! Don't you remember? What happened? What’s this about red? Nothing really, it’s between us girls. - Girl thing. - Tipang had to dig the past! Stop calling me Tipang, that’s so old-school. I want to be called Stephanie. People call me “Steph” now. I’m a flight attendant now, call me Steph. You’re still Tipang to us. - Nothing will change. - Anyway... I’m so grateful that you really came home for our wedding. Of course, I even begged to change my shift’s schedule… Thank you, really. Anything for you guys, because you’re special to me. What about you two, when will you get hitched? Hey, make sure you attend at my wedding, okay? - You have to be there. - Just tell me when. Who’s this Macoy, bro? My childhood friend. We grew up together, got circumcised together. Yeah? His friend who initiates their silliness, Jen was a victim of his pranks too. Does Macoy have a girlfriend now? Busy with his sidelines. Sideline? You mean flings? Why don’t you set him up with Tipang? Hurry up, it’s so hot. Hi! Hi, how’s it going? It’s so hot. Hello! That’s heavy, man. - Good morning! - Aunt Flor! How are you? How are you, Aunt? - I’m doing fine, God bless you! - Do you remember me? Yes, girl, and you look prettier now. You never noticed until now? She’s the same girl. Where’s Macoy anyway? He’s there outside. We’ll go to him. Thank you. Macoy! Hey! I brought your barong! Here. That's tailor-made for you. How are you, Macoy? You're getting prettier. Aren't you getting fatter? She’s insulting you, man. Well, what can I do. This is James, my boyfriend. Hey, buddy. He’s from Manila. From Manila? To think that Jen became your girlfriend for two months! - That was long time ago, Macoy! - Don’t embarrass me, man. I remember, we even went to Sariaya just to buy her that angel for your monthsary! That gift almost fell in the water. You talk too much. Come, let's go back. The sun is too hot. You’re really getting bigger. What’ve you been up to? Just repairing my boat. The propeller broke down. Don’t forget the food we need for the party tonight. I’ll send you a list. What do you like? Sisig. That's delicious!

But I’ll talk to Rolly. Spend the night here. She can stay in James’ room. Come on. Let’s go upstairs. What thappened? Joy, you can’t stay with a husband who keeps beating you up. What about my children? I don’t want them to go through what we experienced. Our mother left us. I love my children. I will do everything for them! I can endure anything! James. The kids might hear us. Babe, please give Jen's father the invitation, and tell Jen and James… I'll just wait on the street. Why? You know what he is like. It’ll be fine. That was a long time ago. It's okay. Thank you. Babe, give the invitation. Come with me! No, you do it. - Just come with me. - Alright. Watch your step. Uncle Nestor. Al. Hi, Uncle Nestor. We’re here for Jen and James.

Remember, don’t put me in the same table as my ex-husband. We won’t make that mistake. - We must go. Thanks again! - Goodbye! Take care! Alright.

There’s a lot of space, and just by the beach. Thanks. Thank you, Father. When do you plan to get married? Next year. That’s why we want to come to formally ask for her hand by Christmas. I'm happy that my daughter is getting married. I don’t approve of your set up. It’s better if your union is recognized by the church. I completely understand. Father? What? Bless me. This is for you. I’ve come for Joy. Rolly... You keep quarreling like kids. She’s upstairs. Okay. Joy? Joy? Wait. You two, fix your problems. We’re going home now, Father. There she is! Settle down guys. Cheers! Cheers! Oh my god! Touch it! Touch it! Okay, okay. - He’s opening the gift. - Save some for us! Sorry boys, sorry boys. There! We didn’t even get a sniff of that. - You naughty girls. - Cheers guys! This guy’s on fire. Wait. Excuse me, guys. - Okay. - Excuse me. Go ahead. Continue. I hate fire! Cheers! Let's go and have fun today! We should really enjoy ourselves before you two get hitched. Next year, it's our turn to go to Manila for your wedding. Promise? Yes, I’ll save for it. I’ll remember that, Al. I’ll save for it. - Did you see my… - What? I think I shoved my wet pants in there. I was sure I had it when I left. Let me check. You’ll stay in that seat, Jen? What? I asked if you’ll remain in that seat. I’ll move to the passenger seat. You can sit here now. Bro, you can drop us here. Why? We’re still far from our house. We’ll pass by somewhere... Bro, we’ll get off here. Still so far from our place. You can drop us off here. Alright. Take care. We'll go ahead. Take care. Take care, Jen, James. What happened? I thought it was over. What do you mean? Your affair with Jen! What? That was a long time ago? We’re getting married already! Let's meet later, Marie. I want to talk to you. What’s happening, Marie… what will happen to us? You’ll be married too, right? Even if we both get married, we can still continue this, right? Why... why did you leave me? Why did you abandon me? Now that I am getting married, you decide to tell me that? What could I do, Marie? I was so young then. Could I have fought my father then? When he sent me to Manila? It won’t work, Jen. I’m starting a family. Al is a good man. It’s true that I love you but... I can only offer you friendship. I’m sorry, James. Let’s stop this. What did you say? I cannot be your wife, James. I cannot be the mother of your children. Is there someone else? Who? There’s no one. No one. It is my problem. I am the problem. I’m sorry. I need to find myself. You don’t know me yet. I need to accept myself first. I’m sorry. Beloved Alfonso and Mariana, in baptism and confirmation, you have partaken in the life and care of our Lord. Our merciful Father, bless and accept your servants, Alfonso and Mariana, and grant them everlasting life. We ask this, through Christ, in unity with the Father and the Holy Spirit, one God, forever and ever. Amen. you became followers of the Lord’s life. You have come together into His house, and of your own will stand before the community to ask for prayers that your joining will be sanctified and strengthened by God. Dear brothers and sisters, who are gathered here today, let us pray for Alfonso and Mariana. Al, I will always be faithful to you. Receive this ring as a sign of my love and fidelity. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. I now pronounce you man and wife. Alfonso, you may now kiss the bride. Kiss, kiss! The wind is wild today, but you see nothing can stop this marriage, it’s sealed already. But while we’re all enjoying the food, let’s give a round of applause to our best man, Macoy. He has a message for the bride and groom. Congratulations to both of you. You’re now Mr. and Mrs. Jimenez. Al, we’ve been together in hard times, and in fun times, even when we stalk Marie during her volleyball games Let's stop fooling around now. That’s all. Congratulations. Thank you, brother. Let’s call the maid of honor, Jen! Come here, Jen! Take the stage, Jen. What’s your message for our newlyweds, Jen? Al, Marie, congratulations. It was Marie who taught me how to tie my shoelaces right. We’ve shared so many things as we were growing up, faced many problems and challenges on the road. But when Marie is with me, everything turns out well. Al, Marie... treasure each other. Take care of each other. Congratulations. Father. It will be a long time before I return. Why are you so stubborn? Why- Why do you hurt me this way? Is it so difficult for you to understand, Jen? No, it’s you who can’t understand. Why can't you accept me for who I am? Jen. What you're doing is a sin. A sin? Did I want to be this way? This is me. This is who I am. If you cannot accept me as your daughter, just accept me as a person.
