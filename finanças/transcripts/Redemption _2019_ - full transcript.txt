Can I come tomorrow at 12? OK... I'll see you then. Bye-bye. Do you have a wig for me? Bruno! I can't believe it's you. Where is she? Come. See looks like my mother. You look like Che Guevara with this beard... Love... Love... -Ready? -Yeah. Let's go. Look at Mum... She's so beautiful! Oh, my princess... Come... What's with the wheelchair? -It was my grandpa's. -Oh... OK. I think I forgot the hospital card. Can you check? -Is it this? -Yes... Thanks. -Here... -Thanks, love. Daddy can't go with you... But I promise to be there next time. -Here... -Thanks, baby. -Will you join me later? -I'll think about it. I want my money! Give me this shit. Don't do that, Tony... I'll pay you. -Don't joke with me. -Don't be like that. Looks like you're broke. It's like this... I'm keeping your car. You have five days to pay me back or you don't get it back. Tony... I'll pay... Move out the way. Let's go. Oh, my son... I'm OK, aunt. How's life? No use complaining... I wish your mom was here. She prayed so hard to see you free. I wasn't a good son. Don't say that. Your mom was very proud of you. Now you have to do things differently. Since your mom died, I've been going once a week. The house is reasonably clean. Thank you so much, auntie. Bruno, take care of yourself. When you have a moment, come by for tea and a chat. I will. Please, Abdul... Please! You motherfucker! Clean it up. Bruno! Love! -Love! -I'll be right there! -Hi, baby! -You went shopping? I'm putting the baby to bed. It's not a new phone but it works. Thanks... I was really needing one. I also have something for us. Nice... What is it? Where did you get money? I had a backup. You and your little secrets... What secrets? It was a backup for emergencies. We don't even have lights. Love... Why don't we go back to South Africa? I think it's better if we stay here. But there are so many opportunities there, we've spoken about it. To run from immigration? All the years we lived there, what did we achieve? Nothing. How will it be different this time? But I am afraid, Bruno. Mia... I know it's not easy... but you have to trust me. Give me some time, life will get better. Trust me. The big piece is mine... Your plate is already full! Will you finish all that? It's mine... There's Tony. My niggas! If we all spoke like him, they'd be fucked. Your cut. Finally. Hallelujah... My hands were itching since morning. It took a while but it's here. -It's not the full amount. -I don't understand? What don't you understand? I'm saying it's not the full amount. -Isn't it five? -What five? Five or seven? Americo! -Guys... -I found it odd. Don't just find it odd. Speak up! -Relax, man. -He's cheating us. Guys... I don't like this mistrust. I'm tired of accusations. If you don't believe me, you call the boss. We don't want to phone anyone. Call him. Speak to the boss. Fuck off, man. This nigga... He thinks we're stupid. Good morning. I'm looking for Mr. Nunes. He's over there, in the offices. -OK, thanks. -You're welcome. Come in... Good morning. If you're selling scrap, look for Antonio outside. I'm looking for Mr. Nunes. Who are you? I'm Bruno Pereira, Sara's nephew. -Have a seat. -Thank you. -How's your aunt? -She's well. What do you do? I'm a trained mechanic, but I can do any work. And stealing? Do you also know how to steal? If I catch you stealing, you're fucked and fired. -Got it? -Yes. Dad. you know it's about filling pockets, politicians' pockets. You seem to be on their side. What about the people's pockets? Are you forgetting the people? Everything is going up and up... Except the minimal wage. That's not right, son. Are you OK, Dad? I'm OK, son... I'm OK. -Don't forget we have hospital on Monday. -Monday inshallah. my son. -We have to be there at 7am. -Inshallah. I'll see you on Monday, my son. Your daughter is a struggle to fall asleep. Reminds me of her dad back in the day. Also didn't like to sleep early. Can I finish it? You know what? When I was in jail I had a hard time sleeping. And now, with you by my side, it's even harder. -Come closer. -Wait, love. The neighbors... The neighbors are never around. -Good morning. -Morning. -Do you live here? -Yes. Is... Mrs Luisa da Conceição home? -What do you want? -I have documents for her to sign. She's not in. -But I can sign. I'm her son. -OK. Please sign here. BANK SUMMONS MUTAME DEVELOPMENT BANK I received this document for my mother. Mrs Luisa, is she feeling better? -She died. -Died? When? Two months ago. I'm so sorry. It says the house was put as guarantee. And if you don't pay the $30,000 loan the bank will sell the house. Thirty thousand dollars? How can you do that to a dead person? Take my house just like that? Sir... We are sorry for your loss but... we must follow procedures. If you pay a fraction, we can stretch the deadlines. How much? Let's see... Around... one thousand dollars. Then we can go back to the initial rates. One thousand dollars... This might help you understand. You'll give it to your daughter one day. That was the main reason for the loan. ONCOLOGY CLINIC -Why didn't you tell me she had cancer? -My dear boy... Forget that. Forget it. Your mum didn't want you to worry. Let it go. It's past. Let it go. By the way, there was a man who contacted your mum. He wanted to buy the house. What do you think? I can't sell the house. The bank won't let me. Even if I could... It's my mum's house... The house I was born in. Who is this interrupting me? Hello? OK. Give me five minutes. What's up, Castigo? Sorry for interrupting Abdul. Too late... Speak up. Boss... I got this deal. Damn... This is a good deal. -We have two containers. -How many feet? 40 feet. -That's a lot of paper, Castigo. -It is, Boss. -Send it to my warehouse. -OK, Boss. -Leaving already? -I gotta go. I'm running late, Abdul. What's the rush? I have a meeting. I've been out too long. -And I took the day off to be with you. -I know. Aren't you forgetting something? Almost forgot. You're an angel. I knew I could count on you. Always. Your gift. -I like it. -I'll call you next week. I know. BACAR BANK STATEMENT Bruno! Fuck off, man! Bruno, your friend is here. Mulatto, my brother. Mulatto. I saw you earlier, couldn't believe it was you. -Turn the music down. -When did you get out? -Turn the music down. -Why? Turn it down, my daughter is asleep. You're a daddy already? Mulatto, my brother... Come, let me give you a hug. Fuck your hugs! You still pissed off? Go to hell. Nigga, I have big jobs for us. We gonna make tons of cash. We'll make you rich, my nigga. -I don't care about your jobs. -Stop fooling around. Fooling around? I was in jail for four years, where were you? My mum died and not even a "Fuck You"! Go fuck yourself. Mulatto. I'm sorry, man. I also had problems. Americo and I were arrested. Don't even mention that rat. And as for you, don't ever set foot here again. Fuck off. Mulatto, don't be like that, bro... Mulatto. Damn. What did your friend want? He's not my friend. You know he won't stop, don't you? What do you want me to do? Let's leave this place, Bruno. Brother... I have a deal for you. Call me. Give them a round and a water for me. What's up? Bro. Mulatto is out of jail. -Our Mulatto? -Yes, he's out. -When did he get out? -I'm not sure. I think recently. I'm happy. Our team is complete. I doubt it. He's pissed with us. I'll make him a offer he can't refuse. He's out of the game. Hey, Tony, a soldier like Mulatto is never out of the game. I don't think so. He's always been stubborn and proud. When he decides something, he sticks to it. Mr. Pereira. Stay calm. This is out of our hands. -You know that the economic situation... -Economic situation? What economic situation? You guys are worse than loan sharks! Fucking thieves! -But Mr. Pereira... -Find someone else to rob. -Can I offer you a water? -Drown in it! Drown in it! Fucking thieves! I understand, Boss. But for this job... I'll need an extra man. One more, one less, that's up to you. I just want it done. Get it? I have a mulatto that is perfect for the job. Don't involve mullatos, they're bad luck. No, Boss, you'll like his work. He's one of mine, he is very good. Are you deaf or what? I'm the boss. I said no mulattos. -Alright, Boss. -I want it done by the weekend. And no fuck-ups. I don't want any bullshit. It's 50% per month. Don't worry. I'll repay you by month's end. I'm warning you, nigga. Wait up, man. Speak later. I'm talking to you, nigga. I'm sorry, man. I know you want nothing to do with me. But I've always wanted to say this. Sorry, nigga. Sorry, my brother. Alright, whatever. Nigga, don't turn your back on me. -We grew up together. You are my brother! -I'm your brother? You know that you can count on me for anything. Give me $3,000. I need to take care of something. Three thousand dollars? Go fuck yourself! My nigga... Come with me. I'll sort you out. Let's shake. Shake my hand, Bruno. Three grand. Thanks, brother. As soon as I have it, I'll pay you back. Don't worry. You're my brother. Thanks, man. -You busy? -No. What's up? I need you to go somewhere with me. Some niggas owe me money and aren't picking up my calls. -Let's go. -Cool. It's getting late. I'm very happy, nigga. -Drop me over here. -I'll drop you home. No, drop me here. Drop me here. Are you sure you want to go home? It's my birthday today. I'm throwing a party at Bito's. Girls and everything, you know me. -I have to go home. -It's gonna be wild. We'll speak tomorrow, bro. Mulatto, I can't believe this. Goodbye. -Do you know what time it is? -I'm coming from work. Really? I went by Aunt Sara, you know how she talks. I tried to call you. The cell battery died. -The baby? -She's asleep. I'm the man. Did you really think I wouldn't celebrate? -Where did you find these chicks? -They're my bitches. Shit, man. He bought a new bike. With our money. Hey, guys. How's it going? -What's up? -Great news. Next week we have a job. This time we'll score for real. Nice. Now we can help Mulatto. Mulatto? We can't work with Mulatto. Have you changed your mind? It's not me. The boss doesn't want any mulattos on the job. -Why not, Americo? -I don't know. He needs us. We have to help him. -But the problem is... -If not him, then who? Brother. Forget the Boss. We're the ones doing the job. Don't worry about him. Come on, man. You gotta find a way. What are you doing out here? Come back to the party. OK. OK. You're right on time. Remember I wanted to introduce you to someone? Here she is. -That's her? -Jenny... Americo... Americo... Jenny... -My pleasure. Jenny. -Speak Portuguese, man. -Let's go back in. -You very handsome. You also very pretty. She's hot, man. But, bro... don't forget. -What? -Mulatto. We'll talk about it. Damn it. There he is. Bruno. what's up? Mulatto, can we chat? About what? I'm in a hurry. Come on, Mulatto. Are you gonna take public transport when we have a car? -Let us give you a ride. -I'll take the bus. Get in, like old times. Don't do that, brother. Get in. -I can't be long. I'm in a hurry. -What's up? Damn it. You're a true loan shark. Not a day has gone by, you're already collecting. At least I didn't come to snatch your house. I'm bringing you business. Mulatto, we have a job. Ten grand each. If I don't get arrested first. Nigga, you do three jobs and your problems are solved. It's an easy job. What's the job? -A little highjack. -A little highjack for ten grand? There is a precious package in the car. How about it? Are you in? What's your name, brother? Paito. Mr. Pereira, your case is very advanced. -Too much time has passed. -How so? The only way to resolve this matter is to pay the full amount of the debt within seven days. The full amount? But the manager said... I know what he said, but the case is already with the court. Lady, where do you think I will find $30,000? I don't know, Mr. Pereira, but if you don't pay, you will definitely lose your house. Hi. You don't owe me an explanation. -Yes, I do. -No need. Aunt Sara told me everything. -I can't lose the house. -Really? Is that all that matters? What about our daughter? What about the four years I visited you in jail? Enduring shitty roads for endless hours just to be with you. I even fell pregnant. I always put us first, believing we had future plans together. And now. you come out of jail and go right back to that shitty life. Is that it? Come on, man! -What do you want me to do? -I want you to go away! Stay out of our lives. My nigga, we gonna make money. Ready? Where to? That was an act to get the Zimbabwean out of prison. Alright. Let's go. Open the boot. Take this. Take it. Don't worry, my nigga. It will be quick. Hurry up... Quick! -Why didn't you tell me it was a kidnap? -Would you have done the job? -You want to put me away again? -Go fuck yourself. I give you a job, and you tell me to go fuck myself? Who do you think you are? -Go fuck yourself! -Fuck off! And you... Out. Get out! Hurry up! I'm telling you to get out! I'll hurt you! Get out! Sit down. Give me the phone. Look over here. Look over here. Look at him, damn it! -That's not Zarina Bacar. -It's her. The car in the photo you sent, she was driving it. Double check. Fuck sake. You! What's your name? I'm talking to you. What's your name? Rabia. Fuck! -Sorry, Boss. I fucked up. -How could you fuck up a job like this? So easy. With all the info. Lately it's been fuck up after fuck up. I'm getting tired of you. -But can't we get money out of this? -What? She's worthless. Her husband is a fucking gambler with more debts than the country. Do me a favor, beat it! -Don't feel down, Boss... -Go. I'll call you. Guys, we have a problem. We kidnapped the wrong person. And the boss won't pay. Won't pay? I don't work for free. I want my money. Fuck off, man! Calm down. But it was his fault. Why should we pay? You shouting at me? You going mad? -But it was his fault. -Why? Why? Who gave us the leads? He did. Who gave us the address, the car and the time? He did. He even sent photos. You guys are complaining as if you never ever get paid. -Has the boss ever cheated us? -Let me speak to the boss. -You can't. -Why not? He doesn't know of you. Doesn't know you exist. You're in this because I gave you this job. You're in this thanks to me. -I did you a favor. -A favor? You put me in this and now this bullshit... I want my money. -You know where to find me. -Mulatto, sit down. Go fuck yourself. On to other news. The sister-in-law of the well-known business man Mustafa Bacar has been returned to her family after being kidnaped for three days. Our source tells us that the amount paid to the kidnappers as ransom was around one million dollars. One million dollars? Motherfuckers! -Did you watch the news? -I did, Boss. And what did you think? I was gonna ask you... You see, my guys are complaining. They say you are keeping it all to yourself, and so on... -Is that what you think? -No, Boss. I'm trying to cool them down. But you know how it is. -This is for you. -Thanks, Boss. I needed it. -Cool down your guys with this. -Don't worry, Boss. They paid. -But not what the media says. -I know. -We have another job next week. -Alright, Boss, just call me. We're being used! What do you mean? You have the guts to ask? Don't you watch TV?

You know how much they got paid. -You... -What? If I'd known you'd be trouble, I wouldn't have given you the job. Never again. Why are you protecting the boss? I'm not protecting anybody, but you guys are always complaining. -He's in it with the boss. -For sure. Guys. I'm getting fed up with this. Who doesn't want to work with me, walk away and become a bus conductor. Long live your strike. Fucking con man. Guys... Let's go somewhere else. Fuck... Guys... How did you find this place? Nigga, we watched movies here as kids. This was "the" place! Great movies. -That was your spot. -Trinita and Bud Spencer... With a squeeze by your side. Guys. The only way to make money is to kidnap the boss. You wanna get killed or what? Nobody fucks him and gets away with it. I'm not afraid. Fucking Amitabh Bachchan, I'll put a bullet in him.
