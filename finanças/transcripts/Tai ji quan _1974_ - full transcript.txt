Tai Chi Chuen builds health and provides self-defense skills It has flourished over 800 years Even when westerners speak of Kung Fu they're bound to know of Tai Chi Chuen Rumored to have originated from Cheung San Fung Its philosophy uses stillness - to overcome action, softness to conquer power Remain tranquil when faced with enemies Move in response to opponents' movements Rolling with the opponent's punches. Make him miss and lose balance Then retaliate using the opponent's own force Pre-empt the opponent once he moves Every technique responding to the opponent's moves Flowing naturally from within. Executed effortlessly Conquering without form Tai Chi should be practiced slowly to relax body and mind So as to build health and relax the body's muscles, tendons - and joints. Such that one is nimble and quick - Agile when responding to opponents, changing techniques speedily Practicing the slow rhythm of Tai Chi will help attain maximum speed This is Yi Jing's philosophy. That for every high there's a low Brother Hu, we have been waiting since morning Waiting up till now. Look at the sun. We can wait no longer If you don't wait When your name is called and you're absent, you've had it! For this month you'd have worked for nothing Whoever fools around with me, is a dead man Stop it, let me look into this What's the matter? Why haven't the wages been distributed? We have been waiting since early morning Stop complaining and keep waiting Keep waiting, for what? You should appreciate Many of them are waiting for the month's wages to buy food and supplies, - they've eventually got to be paid You want to rush me, is it? Supervisor Tang is inside Go and urge him yourself Damn, we have worked hard. Please be generous A day off each month is not enough even for collecting wages. - Right... Supervisor Tang, they are starting to quarrel When the wages are distributed and they discover - they've been cheated and paid just half of it; I'm afraid... Stop whining... This isn't my first time as supervisor I have seen things like these Whoever is disgruntled can leave We can easily hire people with half of their wages Supervisor Tang, it's time to distribute the wages What's the hurry? We're not under the sun I want them provoked If they cause a stir they play into my hands Uncle... Uncle has fainted Get him out of the sun. He fainted under the hot sun Let him rest inside. And get some water and ointment Oh, maybe get a girl to serve him too? What are you joking about? He fainted under the hot sun Uncle, wake up Brother Hu, he has come around. Let's find another place to rest No way, I must go in Try You dare to strike others Who is fighting? You dare deny? Brother Hu, let's leave. Why bother to argue with them? Halt! Which group do you belong to? What's your name? Hu Ping-lien of group Nine On whose influence are you leaning against such that you dare strike others? What power do poor people have? I haven't struck others either I saw with my own eyes up there Nonsense! You call this hitting others. I merely pushed him Right, I'll give you a push too You dare strike me too Brother Hu, stop fighting Brother Hu, ask around and check out who I am before you hit people Supervisor, he hasn't hit anyone Who's that? So it's you I tell you. Striking a supervisor is a hideous offence It doesn't matter who struck the blow. Their wages will be used for medical bills. Then I'll hit you again You... I'm responsible, not Hu What's your name? Ku Ting of group 12 Right, you've worked for nothing this month For nothing? Sir, I badly need the money I'd rather be beaten up OK, that's fair enough Take all necessary revenge Ku Ting Ku Ting It's OK What right have you to beat up others? The June wages will be distributed now Half of the wages are deducted? Really? Why? For the welfare fund It'll be returned after 3 years' of service. - Why? This is as per company rules If you don't like you may quit You want to create trouble Take him for an example This is unfair garnishing of wages If you don't like it, don't work here OK, give me a month's pay Not a cent more You've only worked for a month and have used the company's tools You'll need to compensate for replacement cost too C'mon, off you go Whoever wants to work, get in line Yang Chen, when practicing you need to focus It's hard to improve like that Father, is Ku Ting coming today? He hasn't failed to show up in 10 years Why hasn't he come? Master Ku Ting, come here Have you met a strong adversary? He wouldn't fight with other I think he was beaten up The supervisors wanted to get at someone I was afraid of escalating trouble. So I let them beat me up This is our principle We practice martial arts for health and defense - not for bullying others One has to be tolerant You have trained here for 10 years. You haven't wasted it You are my best student Ten years only to get beaten up What sort of kung fu is that? Yang Chen, perhaps you'll never understand this Tai Chi turns force against itself The punch aimed at you, even if it were powerful, - you could deflect it and go unharmed This is the pinnacle of our style To get beaten up is also kung fu I'll never agree for the rest of my life Come, Ku Ting Ku Ting You haven't yet grasped Tai Chi's philosophy As said in the doctrine: - Use the opponent's force and make him miss Harness the opportunity And use minimum force to deflect maximum power You must remember the Pa Lien foot work I'll keep still if you don't move. But I'll pre-empt your movement when you do When your stance is weak I'll use your force against you Then you'll tumble Father, I don't believe this. Let me try All right Father, did you have to use so much power? This is to teach you a lesson This is called 'Play the Pi Pa' This is 'Repulse Monkey' This is 'Single Whip' This is 'Turn and Strike with Fist' This is 'Parting the Wild Horses' Mane' You ought to remember these techniques Enjoy wine when you can Who knows what the future brings! Waiter Yes Today's wine is insipid like water When a drink gives you blood-shot eyes you'll know the wine is strong Brother Hu, stop drinking Leave me I'll not leave Sit down What's the matter? What's left of the wages given today is a meager dollar after deductions A-Bao's mother is sick again The money I owe you from last month I... Go... Who's pressing for a repayment? - Yes, yes Wait Take it all But... Remember... Though we're poor, don't appear pitiful Ku Ting, take him home All right This damn kid Go back home Damn you, are you blind? - Sorry, sorry Look, we already lead a dog's life Yet, Supervisor Tang wants to deduct half our wages for the so-called welfare fund Forget it, whatever it is We suffer for it Father She needs a doctor I know that too. But doctors decline to come here I took her to a doctor in the afternoon Even before we had gone ten steps of the way mother fainted from the heat If you pay a bit more, the doctor may come This afternoon someone mentioned - a woman is here from Shanghai and is looking for a servant I hear she is willing to pay well. I'll see her tomorrow What is she like? - I don't know The word is she's putting up at Mr. Chin's place Look I wasn't deceiving you, right Mr. Chin is wealthy What good is all this? Frankly, if you want me to stay you should change all the furniture It should be sent over from Shanghai Nothing could be easier With money one can achieve anything Miss Fan, is she qualified enough for you? Too unfashionable That's OK, I'll dress her up What's your name? She's called A-Bao You must obey me while you're here Young master, the masters are here - and are waiting for you in the back yard Go, move Who wants your company? We will get beaten up again No alternative unless we can beat him Enough. Who goes first? Let's all attack together Good Why don't you make your move? Master Yuan, is there anyone who can be my match? It's difficult to find If Master Yang were here - We'll know if I have a match What kind of a fellow is Master Yang? Young master, disregard him What use is that old fellow? Which style is he from? Tai Chi Like this Like catching shrimps Master Yuan, ingratiate him all you want, - but don't insult Tai Chi Chuan You're also a martial arts practitioner and should know the status of Tai Chi Old Yang might not be young master's match Never mind that Master Yuan, get Master Yang to fight with me Yes Go Quickly... Hurry up Quickly... Don't be lazy Quickly What are you doing? It is not yet rest time It is not yet rest time Do you hear? Breaking the duty rules will cause deduction of wages You'd like us to work for free Why are you still here? Didn't you say you quit yesterday? I'm not the only one who quit! All of them will quit! Right, we all quit! Don't listen to him! My dry lips are cracking. Still we don't get a drink? - That's right, go drink some water Brother Hu, oversee the work here I have a matter to attend For this group at month's end deduct one day's salary Supervisor Tang, I think Hu is stirring up trouble By month's end he'll be a dead man Please sit Supervisor Tang, you've ingratiated yourself with Boss Chin And have become a supervisor overseeing thousands of workmen How can we be equal? Elder brother, don't talk like that You call us brothers Supervisor Tang wants us for a big time job I dare not say it's a big job but rather it is a small token That's a lot of money. What do I have to do? Master Yang, There's something you don't know. Since childhood - young master has been interested in martial arts He is also courteous He has heard of your name and would like to see your skills You should consent Master Yang, if you agree I am sure that Master Chin - will definitely reward you well By then you'll know, I've come with good intentions We don't need this kind of money to buy food and supplies If he is so generous, - ask him not to treat road workmen in such a mean way Yang Chen Master Yang, are you going or not? You should say something and give me face I'm not going You have broken a carrying stick You think I don't carry enough and add more weight such that it's broken I don't care Your wages will be deducted accordingly I... Listen, all of you You'll all leave one hour later from tomorrow No way... What else are you up to? What blas? attitude! When you first arrived you made your mark on the contract Didn't you read one condition in the small print? If we were literate, we wouldn't be in this job. - Correct... Right, I'll read it to you If required by the job the company can extend the working hours Workers cannot refuse No way... We're not made of iron We'll leave at the same time tomorrow Right... Ku Ting, you were trained in martial arts Not really been trained in it That's good enough for us Who did you train with? Master Yang No wonder you submitted yourself to the beating You can't be hurt What do you mean? Look, I 'm still bruised That's nothing Ku Ting, do your job well I'll promote you Ku Ting, let's go! Coming Remember, learning from anyone is better than learning from Hu Can't imagine in such a small place There's someone like you You'll be famous if you come with me to Shanghai Famous? You wouldn't understand now It's strange! You look very different What do you want? What can I want? Who is it? Master Yuan wants to see you. - I know What's the matter? Where is that Tai Chi Master Yang? He wouldn't come. - Nonsense Didn't you say I asked for him? Why didn't you say so? He also scolded me He must come and see me Young master, show him who's the boss Bring him here and he will make you angry Then, get rid of him I don't want to meet his kind Young master, it's easy to kill him But if anything goes wrong I'll take care of the worst What? You doubt my prowess? No... This technique to divert your force - to strike you with your own force To use strength against strength Ku Ting, today I'll be able to try out what you got Stand fast Come, hit me Ku Ting, your chi has reached my level How come you couldn't withstand my punch? You are not focused What's bothering you? Nothing You don't fool me Tai Chi is different from other martial arts An un-focused mind would just cause confusion I'd like to leave earlier What for? To see A-Bao A-Bao? Young master, where's the young lady? What do you want with her? You can tell me I'd like to go out for a while to see Ku Ting I'll be back soon All right Thank you, young master Young master, you... No, don't Please don't No, don't No, please don't Although we practice martial arts nevertheless we should have moral The assignment given by Chin is best refused To perform in public for a living is better than - being a running dog of the rich Master Yang is right Come on, don't let him get away Who hired you to assassinate me? Speak up Who hired you to come after me? Chin Ta-hsing Father, father Father Yang Chen, quick, get Ku Ting A-Bao, A-Bao How are you? Why don't you say something? A-Bao, what's wrong with you? Don't you recognize me? I'm Ku Ting A-Bao, A-Bao Ku Ting, Ku Ting! Cut that racket in the middle of the night You're disturbing peoples' sleep Ku Ting, Ku Ting! - What's all that noise? It's middle of the night People can't sleep Ku Ting! Someone's calling me Wait for me Master Chin Ku Ting! Ku Ting, don't stay here! Come along Ku Ting, if you don't come with me now we can't see father anymore. Let's go Master... - Father Go lie down. I'll get the doctor Ku Ting, you've come at last I haven't begged anyone all my life Now I'm asking you a favor Go with Yang Chen. - Father Escape in the middle of the night Master, you... Ku Ting, be tolerant in all matters Yang Chen Father. - Master With people like you working for me I'm made to look like a fool to all Where's Yang Tang? Got himself drunk in the backyard last night No one has seen him Young master, we have taken care of old Yang Had I been aware of your incompetence, I would have done it myself You said old Yang has a daughter Who else is there? A disciple repairing the roads His name? - Ku Ting I'm going out for a while I'll meet Ku Ting and then return immediately This is good To have established connections with him Really terrible! So young I wonder where she is from A-Bao? Good, they know her What's your relationship with her? She is uncle's daughter Go and alert her family Go quickly All right Go... A-Bao, I'll beat you if you don't go home That's strange Ku Ting hasn't returned the whole night Quite late last night, a girl was looking for him You're worried about him Ku Ting is not that kind of person I am not fooling you That girl is tall, has a braid and big eyes She's quite pretty so to speak She's Master Yang's daughter Has something happened to Yang? Inform the supervisor. I'll start work later You are Hu Ping-lien? You're about to die What? I say it's time you to die What? Hu, you heard me We are the ones who beat you up But the one after your life is Tang Hoi Hay Ku Ting... Ku Ting is here Ku Ting Ku Ting, you know already? You are so grieved yourself How can you comfort uncle and aunt? Uncle? Aunt? A-Bao is dead What did you say? A-Bao, dead? Let go A-Bao is dead, he saw it. - That's right She was fished out of the water Ku Ting... Where's A-Bao? Speak A-Bao is at the morgue Why have you waited till now to come A-Bao was best friends with you Why she jumped into the river you should know She went to boss Chin's place to serve a lady I mean, after only one day...! I am leaving Master Chin Ku Ting, what's the matter? What's wrong? A-Bao was killed by the Chin family Ku Ting, be careful of what you say If you babble like that you're the one who'll suffer Not the powerful Chins. - Right... No matter what the Chin family is involved Let's take this up with them Where's Brother Hu? Why haven't we seen him? For him to take uncle would be best Brother Hu heard Miss Yang sought you And said maybe something happened to Yang Yang was stabbed He died What? Ku Ting, uncle's matter is urgent We can't wait for Hu Say, why don't you and I accompany uncle to the Chins Uncle, I'll take you there This girl A-Bao; Did she not take a month's salary? She got that long ago That's fine then What are you grumbling about? She jumped into the river and died What nonsense! She had her own free will If she wanted to jump, was it up to me to stop her Master Chin, - she did work here Have a heart Get lost Have a heart? How much can I do? If nothing happened here A-Bao wouldn't have jumped Bloody nonsense You want to blame it on me? I saw her at mid night yesterday That's your business It might be because you failed to rape her that you pushed her into the river Get lost at once! Master Chin, you... Master Chin, please... What's the matter? These three have gone crazy and want to blackmail me Oh, you're here as well! Supervisor Tang, Uncle's daughter came here to serve the lady Don't involve me She jumped into the river and died What's the big deal? Go and collect 10 dollars from accounts Father, don't give a cent We owe them nothing If we start a precedence it might appear we're obliged. That'll be big trouble Tell them to be gone. - Get lost... go... Young master, this is Ku Ting whom you have been looking for Drive those two out Master Chin, don't you have any conscience? Don't go I heard you trained under Master Yang and trained in Tai Chi Chuen, is it? Spar with me Let me see - what over-rated kung fu is that If the environment hinders you, follow me to the backyard There's plenty of space See how many punches you can take Close the door! What? Will you not strike? While I did learn kung fu, it was not intended for fighting If it's not for fighting, what's the point? You wouldn't understand Oh, so you do? You killed A-Bao Rubbish! Tolerate You can't deny you killed A-Bao Nonsense Take it up with the court I know you fear not the court; However you'll fear because someone has died because of you You killed A-Bao. - You dare say that again? Tolerate Young master, he's not your match I'll kill him if he doesn't fight Open the door... Young master, he tricked you He uses your own force against you That's the essence of Tai Chi A waste of energy You can't kill him alone Let's all join forces and kill him Why don't you strike back? You bastard, why don't you fight back? I know of a way Young master, push him here Tolerate... Ku Ting, fight... Release Ku Ting... Why doesn't Ku come out? Release Ku Ting... Why Ku Ting didn't come out? Chin has no reason to retain him. Not let him go? - Right... What business is it of yours? Are you going to release him? Ku Ting, are you all right? I am okay. - That's fine then Tang Hoi Hay, fire these people and never hire them again We'd rather be beggars than work for you Take back your dirty money! Let's go... Go Young master, a man of your status shouldn't fight with these people Ku Ting, you're useless Having trained in kung fu for 10 years - all you do is take a beating And dare not fight back. Why don't you fight back? Don't blame him If he hits Chin, Chin has the money to get away with murder. What do we have? Yes, no wonder... I am useless I can't deal with them on your behalf You can only seek Brother Hu's help Yes, it's about time Let's go find Brother Hu. - Yes. Come on, let's get brother Hu Do your work quickly... What's wrong? Do it quickly What's the matter? - Here comes Ku Ting I don't know What are you doing? Brother Hu... Brother Hu is dead! Brother Hu was beaten to death by someone. He died horribly Where did he die? - In the graveyard Brother Hu didn't die peacefully He died a cruel death Ku Ting, avenge Brother Hu's death... Ku Ting, you can't fall. It's all up to you now Up to me? We intended to discuss with Brother Hu. Now he's dead Who else can we turn to? Ku Ting, Brother Hu has been killed And A-Bao committed suicide Even your Master was done away with You must seek revenge Ku Ting, you must avenge them! What are you doing? Back to work! Father, I'll avenge you Who killed master? Chin and his gang Father, even if I'm alone, I'll avenge you Yang Chen Just before master died... Don't say that You said Master was killed by Chin and his gang Did Master tell you that before he died? No, but I know Yuen said Chin wanted to see father Chin went away unhappy Someone named Wong came at night Father went out with him - and returned with a knife stuck in him Yang Chen, when Master asked us to leave, it was precisely to avoid trouble What do you mean by that? Yang Chen, I long knew you wanted to stay out of trouble I haven't involved you in my bid for revenge Yang Chen. - Leave. Go away My father asked you not to come here again Yang Chen, I... You're useless, wasting your kung fu Father Father Another bottle Ku Ting, you've never been the drinking kind In any event we're closing Go home Give me another bottle. - No You can't drink anymore. - Give it to him Master Yang, you... I said give him more wine Master Yang, you don't know... He is not the drinking kind Stop grumbling I know better If a man wants to drink heavily, he must have his reason Are you going to give him more wine? Yes, yes One bottle for me too Yes, yes Here's the wine Come with me. I'll take you to a place to drink. There. We'll not be disturbed Friend, what do you do? Road works There's someone called Hu Ping-lien You know Brother Hu too? What's your name? Ku Ting Do you know this? I've learnt a little from Tai Chi Master Yang My master... Master Yang, he was murdered. - Tolerate... Father, I'm going What's with you? A girl just went by, full of fury Brother Yang, there's something I've to take care of What are you laughing at? I am weak by nature Hiding behind others, and tolerating all the time I haven't done a thing which has been useful to society What's the use of kung fu? Now I'm going to look for someone You should come with me Me? Which lady wants to see me? Lady, so early in the day What can I do for you? I'm here to kill you Interesting! You know kung fu I have to kill you... She's Master Yang's daughter Even better Young master, at the site today no workman has shown up What's wrong? Miss Yang, after we've finished playing here - let's frolic in the bed You beast! Halt Do you still remember at the graveyard you killed Hu? Ku Ting, you want to die? Supervisor Tang... Chin Ta-hsing, - you ruthless murderer! Yang Tang, do you want to die? I have been avoiding to do what's just and should have died long ago But you will not live either! Ku Ting, Ku Ting! Yang Chen! Why don't you fight? Rescue Brother Yang first Not that easy Where is Ku Ting? Brother Yang Brother Yang... You've come I won't make it Ku Ting, it was Chin who murdered - your master and raped A-Bao And also killed your friend Hu You must avenge them Ku Ting, we can't drink together again... You've spent 10 years learning kung fu for nothing You're useless Yang Chen, come along. Let's take revenge You little swine, you can run to nowhere Chin Ta-hsing, today is the day of reckoning What's the big deal about Tai Chi? Your master was killed by my men I'll kill you, Chin Oh? Vengeance, is it Ku Ting. - I've killed someone Until now I never imagined I'll kill someone Ku Ting. - I've killed someone! I'm not happy at all The thought is so unbearable Those people... Why do they enjoy killing people? Say no more
