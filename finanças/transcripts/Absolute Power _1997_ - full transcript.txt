Don't give up. Oh, I never do. May I? Your work with your hands, don't you? - Hey, Red. - Luther. Your life would be a lot simpler if you could learn to operate a VCR. True. Truer words were never spoken. Let's see. Here we go. That's nice. It's okay, he's not here. Anyway, I told him that... ...I was sick... ...so you can relax. Cheers. I'll be right back. You like that, huh? Oh, yeah. So, you want to play, huh? You okay? How'd you like that? - You slap me? - Don't slap me. Little bitch. Alan, what are you doing? Alan! Stop it. Alan, you're hurting me. I'll hurt you good. You're hurting me. Goddamn you! You want to be hurt? I'll hurt you. - Let go! - Do you? You like that? God damn you. - Get away. - Fucking bitch. - Get away. - Get back here. Get back here! Stop it! Stop it. What are you doing? Bitch. You bitch. Want to play? I'll show you how. You fucking bastard. You bastard. You like that? Come back here. Let go of me! You bitch, you cut me... ...Goddamn it. Fucking asshole. - I'll kill you. - Bitch. Help! Help! Did you kill her? No choice in the matter, sir. What am I going to do? Jesus, Tim, what did we do? No choice in the matter. What the hell was that? Oh, shit. My God. Oh, my God. Jesus. Do you realize what a shit storm we're in? Come on, tell me. Nothing to tell. He screamed for help. You heard no sounds of violence till then? Nothing we haven't heard before. - Maybe I should call the police now. - Jesus. What? Bill? Why don't you think about that. Just take a second... ...and think about that. Think real... ...fucking... ...hard. It's... ...probably not a good idea. Here's what happened. Poor Christy... ...came home alone... ...and interrupted a burglary. Sound logical? Sure. We'll have to sanitize this place. Did you have sex with her? I don't know. You'll have to examine her. - I'm no gynecologist. - I just made you one. Christ. - I'll take that. - Both their fingerprints are on it. Thanks for sharing. Gloria? - Did I kill her? - Everything'll be fine. Come on... ...just don't worry about it. - Oh, God. - Now be careful. Just don't get blood on you. I'll take care of everything, okay? Just like I always do. - Shit! - What? Madame's purse. Miss Russell. Let me get him. Thank you. - I got him. - Fine. Nice and easy, sir. My God! No knife! - What? - Where's the knife? In the bedroom. - Come on. - Get up there. Shit. Shit. Go! Excuse me. I got the number. Gee, guys, maybe it was the bogey man. Don't forget to check under the bed. You may have buried us. I got his license, remember? You think he'll sit around waiting for us, asshole? Take it easy, Miss Russell. Everybody shut up, all right? What have you got? Oh, boy. Okay, Tim. Two-way mirror. We better get cracking on that license number. That's all we've got. He's got the letter opener. Blood. Fingerprints. Jesus... ...think what he can do. The man's a thief. A thief who witnessed a murder. It looks like he stole a bunch of money. I'll tell you what he'll do. He'll run like hell. They beat us by seven. By seven. Who'd have thought that. Kate. It'd be a little late for me, wouldn't it? The jogging, I mean. Kind of dumb way to start, isn't it? But I did... ...want to talk to you. About? About the weather, actually. Getting kind of cool in the evenings. That happens this time of year. I was thinking of... ...moving to a kinder, more gentle climate. I thought I'd talk it over with you... ...since you're my only family. Luther, you don't have me. I was the only kid at show-and-tell who got to talk about visiting day. This move, it would be a... ...permanent one, you understand? We never see each other anyway. I haven't seen you since Mom died. That's a year. Look... ...you had a right to choose your life. You were never around. Fine. I have no plans to be around for you. Wait a minute. Wait. You're lying, aren't you? Are you active again? Is that why you're here now? I don't believe you. Oh, Christ. Father, what have you done? Christy Sullivan? Wife of Walter. Most likely came home and stumbled onto a burglary. Some burglary. I wish my carpets were this clean. I couldn't find one decent fingerprint. - Are you serious, Laura? - It's like Mary Poppins was here. Where's Mr. Sullivan? Sorry, Seth. The entire Sullivan household went to Barbados two days ago. Thanks for your support. No, wait. It gets worse. The shots came from here. If she stumbled on a burglary... ...she'd have been here. But she was killed exactly where she is. The blood patterns indicate that. What's she doing here? Looks like someone sat here, but I couldn't find any prints. Think old man Sullivan hid in this chair and watched his wife perform? Oh, God, I hope not. For his sake. He's such a great man. Be careful, now, digging that out. Seems he tried to strangle her. Then he went to the door to shoot her from behind? He also inspected her vagina. He did what? Why? Maybe he didn't remember he did her. A strong burglar with a weak mind. Obviously, it's another open-and-shut case. Tomorrow's temperatures should climb into the 70's, with lows around 50. Mr. Sullivan? Sorry to bother you. Seth Frank, senior homicide detective for Middleton County. My client's in no mood for conversation, sir. That's all right, Sandy. You're in charge of the case, Mr. Frank? Yes, sir. I must ask you a few questions. What is it you want? Positive identification? That was my wife. Anything else? You were in Barbados for two days? I took the staff. Always do this time of year. Your wife didn't come with you? Well, she was. Had it all planned... ...but you know women. She changed her mind. I had been married to my Rebecca for 47 years. When she died... ...I decided I never wanted that pain again. One thing I knew about Christy: She was going to outlive me. I think that's enough for today. Sir, I have to ask you about the vault. You mean the contents of the vault, of course. - Sandy, you go on. - Walter? No, really, I'm all right. You go on to the reception. Obviously I can't make it. I'm sure everyone will understand. You don't mean the contents. You mean the chair. You must ask about the chair. Yes, sir, I do. Why? Are they connected? Someone may have been sitting in it and have been involved in the murder. You're a great man. I've the deepest respect for you. I'm sorry to do this. I promise you none of this will make my highlight reel. Well, I hoped I could satisfy her... ...but you know, she... ...had needs and she... ...didn't want to go behind my back. She suggested the chair. She hoped I might get to like sitting there. I didn't. For 80 years I've tried to live... ...a decent life. I've given a billion dollars to charity. If this comes to trial... ...none of that will be remembered. I'll just go out... ...the joke of the world. I understand, sir. I'll do what I can. Will you listen to me whine? I apologize... ...Mr. Frank. Just do your job, huh? - And I'll try to do mine. - Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir. General. Ladies and gentlemen... The President. Sandy. Mister President. - Take a walk with me. - Certainly, sir. Tell me about Walter. How is he? Well, he's 80 and alone, Mr. President. He understands that, officially, my hands are tied. But he's very moved by your concern, sir. - Any news of the killer? - No. Why isn't there? Who's in charge? Top man. He spent eight years, homicide work in New York. I understand how you feel. It's hard to be patient. No one understands how I feel. I'm supposed to have all this power... ...and I can't even help my oldest friend. You and I know, more than any man alive... ...Walter Sullivan put me here. And now when he needs me most... ...well, he must feel abandoned. I'll have a press conference. I'll have Walter come. I'll embrace him in front of the world. He'll treasure that, Mr. President. What a generous gesture. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Tennis elbow. This thing is getting worse, Gloria. I need to see a doctor. The country would have to be informed, Mr. President. What happened to my rights to privacy? I think she nicked a tendon. Burton says it's a flesh wound. Since when did you become an expert, Bill? You ever been wounded? Yes, sir. A few times. Are you serious about this press conference? Of course I am. Walter's like a father to me. Shall I bring Mrs. Richmond home for it? I don't think Mrs. Richmond's mission... ...to help the poor in Asia needs to be interrupted. What do we know so far? We've checked his license plates. He stole the car from a police impoundment lot. We're not dealing with a fool here, are we? Has he initiated contact? Burton doesn't think he will. I agree. I apologize. This won't happen again. Consider it a blip... ...on the screen. That's all he is, too. He could be a little more than that. He saw. He saw nothing but a drunk woman who liked rough sex too much. He's a burglar. Who'll believe him? It's not as if he has any evidence or anything. He's a burglar. Who'll believe him? It's not as if he has any evidence or anything. Boy, you always did disappear good, Luther. You're trying to say I have a weak face, right? I'm just saying you're lucky. Some of my customers, no matter what I do, still stand out. How many passports you want? Four should do the trick. Different looks, matching international driver's licenses. Since it's you I'll throw in some dummy credit cards. How are the rugs I made you holding up? Good. The mustaches and the beards also. We try to give quality for our money. You leaving the country for permanent? That could be, yeah. Does it matter where you've been? I hate doing... ...those Asian passport stamps. Make it European and the Caribbean in the winter and... How long will all this take? It usually takes some time. For you I'll rush it. You were always very dependable. Listen, Luther. I don't want to know what you're into. I do, but I won't ask. But leaving the country forever... What is it? I just never figured you for a runner. Luther, 30% of my runners, they kill themselves within five years. Right now, five years doesn't sound too bad. Take care. See you. Okay, see if this makes any sense. I am Christy Sullivan... ...I come in a bedroom and I surprise a burglar. Now, you're the burglar coming out of the vault. Gold star. I draw my gun. Boom. Why bother to strangle her when you could shoot? Why do I bother to strip her and then put her clothes back on? There I can help you out. Before you were a burglar you were a dry cleaner... ...and you love beautiful clothes. Thanks a lot. And you dress her because... She was a good customer and you didn't want her to be embarrassed. She had a 0.21 blood alcohol level, not that that makes any difference. She didn't drive. The chauffeurs, they keep exact mileage on these cars. They haven't been driven since the clan left town. I checked every cab and limo service. No one knows a thing. Somebody drove her home. Who? - Why haven't they come forward? - Maybe... ...because whoever drove her home killed her. Maybe. I love this case. Lieutenant? The problems you had with the phones? - Just took care of them. - Thank you. Just part of the job. I hate people who say that. It is your fucking job. Remember the bullet hole in the wall? Guess what? No slug. Why take a slug out of the wall when there's one stuck in her head? Different from the one in her body? Two different guns means two burglars. Two guys broke in? They both went out the window? That's bullshit. By the way... ...why he or they go out the window in the first place, when he or they... ...got in by breaking a zillion-dollar security system? A Bill Burton from Secret Service is in the parking lot. Thanks. What's Secret Service doing in the parking lot? Bill Burton. Hi. Seth Frank. To what do I owe the honor? I know you must be going crazy, but the boss is interested about your progress. We could help each other out. What do you have in mind? You know how close he and Sullivan are. Right. Well. The minute anything breaks... ...call me and I'll tell the president. He'd be the first to alert Mr. Sullivan. It'd mean a lot to him. And any red tape you want cut, done. Here's my numbers. Any leads? We're still trying to figure it out. - I loved playing Sherlock Holmes. - Secret Service guys do that? I was a state trooper before the government got me. Wait. You're that Bill Burton? I was younger and dumber then. I was younger. I think I'm dumber now. Keep in touch. My chef makes them especially for me. I promise you, they're sinful. You're a salesman, Mr. Sullivan. This is a new arena for me... ...but from what I'm told, you... ...have a flawless reputation... ...which is why I need to employ you, Mr. McCarty. Understood. I don't know who it is I'm after yet. Until I do... ...you'll have to wait in Washington for instructions. I'm afraid that's out of the question. My work is not very creative... ...and I do it because I enjoy living beyond my means. I can't afford to just sit around. My father died when I was ten years old. He was a miner. He died of lung disease. I became rich at 25. The first thing I did was buy that mine, close it down... ...and give every miner $50,000 to retire on. You will wait in Washington, Mr. McCarty... ...and I will put... ...one million dollars expenses... ...in a Swiss bank of your choosing... ...and... ...when the time comes... ...two million dollars a bullet. You are a salesman, sir. Selling sin is easy. - Who is he? - That's Luther Whitney... ...one of the world's great thieves. I'm going nuts with this. I was up all night. I remembered your notion about how maybe it was two burglars. Around dawn I thought: What if it's not two burglars but what if it's one guy... ...trying to throw us off by making it look like two? I called the FBI. They keep track of this stuff. There's maybe six guys who could have done the Sullivan job. I've traced all six... ...only Whitney lives in Washington. Why's it I never heard of him? 'Cause he hasn't been arrested in 30 years. What's this? His graduation picture from Harvard? That's ancient history. He was part of a gang. Three-time loser. Since he got out the last time... ...no one's touched him. Anytime something big comes up they question him, but it never sticks. We can make this stick. I bet this is our guy. He's local. You can't ask for anything more. Well, we got a problem. What? He hasn't killed anyone in 45 years. Korea. So what, he's a veteran. He's not just a veteran. He's a wounded veteran. I got his war record here. Battles, commendations... ...decorations up the kazoo. He lives alone on his disability. That's what he says anyway. But... I don't see this guy as a killer. He's just a great thief. Besides, I don't do war heroes. Well, you must be smart. Pardon me? Usually it takes you guys a week to get to me. I recognize your picture... ...from the newspaper. Nice to meet you. Would you like a signed confession now, or would you like to have coffee first? Before I send you away for life, I should check out your alibi. I was watching football... ...with a friend, Red Bransford. He owns a saloon here in town. You can ask me about the game if you like. I could be lying. You've been following the case? I have. I love true crime. FBI says only a few guys could handle the Sullivan job. I got a list. You're on it. How I wish it were true. This person, they... ...they go in the front door, then out a window and down a rope at night? If I could do something like that I'd be the star of my A.A.R.P. Meetings. What, the American? Association of Retired Persons. Luther, why was this so difficult? You want me to help you solve your case? Just looking for insight. How would you... Scratch that. How would one go about it? What kind of person should I look for? Except for the rope trick, an older person. Like me. Because? Well, you need patience. The secret is research. At least I've read that. What kind of research? From what I saw on the tube, this is a rather large home. There must be an architectural office. You'd have to go to the library, go through public records... ...find out where that office is and then you break in. You xerox the plans and get them back by morning. Why not just steal them? Anyone can break in, but breaking in... ...without people knowing it, that's the trick. Then there's the general contractor... ...and there's the security company. Do you realize the skill in breaking the security of a security company? I don't know how those guys do it. Why go to all that trouble? It's a large vault. There must be a secret way into it. There was, that's what I don't get. How do you mean? This guy had obviously done the research you're talking about. So why take a crowbar to open this vault... ...when there's a clicker right there? Clicker? Gizmo. Like a VCR remote. Sounds amazing to me. Must have been a lot of valuables in that vault. Close to five million, total value. Is that funny? Are you trying to surprise me? I was trying to surprise you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. There you go again. Would the burglar use a disguise? He might. Get with the program, if you want to catch this guy. It is a guy, we think? Some sort of a Ioner? Weirdo, yeah? Maybe like you. I'd be the perfect prototype, actually. But you see a person long enough, you start putting things together. That's why these top guys have disguises. Some of them, I understand, become make-up experts. Hire wigmakers and things like that. Why don't you go on about the wigmakers? Well, I would... I must go have my pacemaker checked. It's been so exciting talking to you. A: You don't have a pacemaker. And B: I'll be back tomorrow. Tomorrow is promised to no one. Good-bye. Pacemaker, my ass. Oh, Katie. You must start eating better than this, darling. I'm having this press conference here... ...because it is at this courthouse... ...that Christine Sullivan's killer will be tried for his crime. As you know, I came from an impoverished family... ...in an impoverished town... ...but we kept our doors... ...unlocked. We all lock our doors now... ...but that's not what concerns me. Ginger ale. We lock our hearts. And could you turn that off? - That is the sadness. - In a second. That... ...is the loss. We lock our hearts to the cries of the weary. We are locking our hearts... ...to the poor and their pain. Sisters and brothers, we are locking... ...our hearts to ourselves. Turn it back on. - You just said... - I know... ...but turn it on. We feel that savagery and violence... ...mustn't be allowed a place at table. That is wrong. That is not America. I'll fight that battle. Dear friend... ...old friend... We'll fight that battle. Who can explain the ways of chance? If we had not met, I'd not be president today. If Christine... ...had not taken ill... ...she'd be with you in Barbados now. Walter, you've been like a father to me. I would give the world... ...to lessen your pain. Thank you. You heartless whore. I'm not about to run from you. Thomas Jefferson used the Green Room as a dining room. The walls are covered with green silk... ...as they were when James Monroe was president. Many valuable objects and paintings in this room. Moving on to the Blue Room... ...James Hilburn built the Blue room as an oval... ...to please President Washington. At Christmas the chandelier is removed and the Christmas tree... ...stands in the middle of the room. From the window you see the Jefferson Memorial. We'll move on to the Red Room. The walls are covered with red silk. He was in the building. He took a guided tour. I've never dealt with blackmail before. He doesn't want money. You are a mind reader too, now. No, I just looked on the back. See? "I don't want money." He has the guts of a burglar. Wish we had him. Are you finished your recruiting speech? I'd like to know how I handle this. Like you handled the letter opener. Gee, Bill... That could be construed as... ...criticism. You really want me for an enemy? I should have called the police that night, but I was weak. You convinced me to stay silent. I regret that. Know this: Every time I see your face I want to rip your throat out. Fine. You win the pissing contest. What do I do? Nothing. He's making a terrible mistake. He thinks he has time. He doesn't. Frank'll bring him in. Then what? Then I kill him. Miss Whitney? I'm Seth Frank. Excuse me. Thanks. For a tough prosecutor you sure don't resemble your reputation. Is that good or bad? I don't know. Lieutenant, I told you on the phone... ...I'm not involved with my father, so this is a waste of time for me. What do you expect me to do, get up and leave? All right. All right. Your father disappeared. I need your help. Lieutenant, I don't know the man. He was in jail when I was a kid. When he got out my mother and I went to live by ourselves. We don't make contact. He doesn't care about me. I've seen him once this year. When? Couple days ago. He said he might be leaving town. Can I get back to work now? - You know where he might be? - Don't waste my time. He doesn't want you to find him, you won't. He left town, he skipped the country? I'm saying, you won't recognize him. He could be right around the corner. - He always had a safehouse. - Where? He never said. How do you know he had one? My mother loved him, all right? Even after she left him, even when she was dying... ...he was all she talked about. "If only he hadn't done this. - "If only he hadn't done that." - What else? - How long has he lived here? - Years. Never been. Strange place for a thief to leave a key, no? He always did that. He sure left in a hurry. I wonder what scares a professional thief like that? He wasn't at these places. My college graduation. My law-school graduation. The night my mother and I... We went out to celebrate because I had gotten my first job. Me alone on the steps. I'd just won my first case. I used to think sometimes... I'd come home and I'd sense he'd been in the apartment. That he'd been looking at my things. Checking the refrigerator because he never thought I ate right. I know it sounds crazy, but I've always... ...I've always felt that he was around. Do a good thing. Help me bring him in. Leave a message on his answering machine. You're worried about him. It's true. You are worried. This is not a normal case. His life could be in danger. You can save him. - He won't come. - Of course... ...he'll come. You're all he has. He's running and scared and he's right to be scared 'cause he'll get caught. - You don't know the heat on this. - He's not a murderer. Maybe. Maybe he is innocent. If so, I'll have him home in a few hours. What happens if some ambitious hotshot tracks him down? I can guarantee his safety. You call. I'll make a promise. You'll have your father back. Seth Frank. I left a message on his machine. He called me back within the hour and I'm meeting him tomorrow afternoon. Where? Open-air place near my office. Cafe Alonzo. What time? Four o'clock. It will be deserted then. Sounds good. Thanks a lot, Kate. Dad. Hi. It's, it's Kate calling. I was wondering... ...if you could call me, please. There's... ...some things I'd like to talk with you about and maybe even... ...get together, if... ...that's possible. Thanks, and talk to you soon. Dad. Hi. It's... ...Kate calling. I was wondering... ...if you could call me, please. There's... ...some things I'd like to talk with you about and maybe even... ...get together. You all know where you're supposed to be and when. He's slippery. He's like an eel. He gets a whiff of a cop, he'll disappear. Nobody moves until you get my order. Then we move in on him. Expect Whitney to show up... ...around 4:00. His daughter will be waiting for him. The important thing is to stay on your positions... ...until you hear the order to move in on him. - There you go, sir. - Thanks. Gather around, gentlemen. Nobody moves till the suspect's in place. Any questions? See you at the Alonzo. Boss is grateful. I figured he'd appreciate having an eyewitness. This is our guy. If he isn't, he sure disappeared awful fast. See you there. Right. Tums? Got my own. Come on, Kate. - She'll show? - Yeah, she'll be here. Miss? What you want? Nothing. Thank you. Got to. Pardon? Oh, you sit. You eat. Please. Geez, this guy wasn't part of my master plan. Unbelievable. I'm waiting for someone. He must eat too, please. He will. We will. We'll order half the menu, just not now. Maybe that's him disguised as a Chinaman. Check out this guy in the hat. Believe that's our man. - We're in business. - All units: Suspect's approaching. Stay in place. Wait for my signal. I didn't kill that woman. You must believe that. Just hold on. Let him get settled. You've got to believe that. I think we're ready. Damn it! You okay? What was that? Don't know. Where did those shots come from? - Did you do that? - We better not have. Where did those shots come from? Where's Whitney? Quit standing around here. Go find him. Take it easy. Take it easy. Take it easy, now. Stay calm. There's no reason to panic. Everyone will just kindly take it easy. Messy. I like that in a woman. Here. I've got a few numbers here. The top one's... ...Iocal police, that's my office, at home, beeper. I live alone too. You can call anytime. Shall I have someone spend the night? No, I want to get some sleep. I'll keep surveillance outside until this is over. I feel he'll try to contact you. You're on a hot streak, I guess. Listen, I'm sorry. Anything unusual at all... ...call right away. It's not a bother. I live alone. You said. Feeble, huh? You want something for the road? I've got water and water. Deal. Pellegrino would be great. What's so funny? I say it wrong? I'm tired. I'm just tired. Listen... ...there's one thing... ...I forgot to tell you. I live alone. Lock up behind me. - How's that? - Real good. Try to get some sleep. Thank you. I betrayed you twice, Luther. You should know. You're not the first. Why'd you come? I couldn't have my daughter thinking I was a murderer. I mean this afternoon, to the restaurant. Why'd you come? You must have suspected or you wouldn't have been prepared. My daughter wanted to see me. The robbery was going fine until they came in. They were drunk. I was hidden in the vault. And the sex, it started getting rough. He started beating her... ...strangling her. I thought he'd kill her. And she... ...somehow got the upper hand. She started to stab him and these two guys came in and shot her. The guys who tried for you this afternoon? Possibly. I don't know. Unless Walter Sullivan was taking a shot at me. That's a pretty powerful enemy. That's very good going. Not as powerful as the President of the United States. That's right. Alan Richmond, he was the drunk. The two guys were Secret Service, and... ...Chief of Staff Russell, she handled the cover-up. But then you go to the police. That's what innocent people do. They go to the police. Sure. That young man who was just here, he'd believe me over the president, right? Why should I believe you? 'Cause I swear to you, Kate. I swear to you on Maddie's grave. Yeah, that's right. Your mother's grave. I'd kill myself before I'd lie about that. Oh, Jesus, Luther. - I know. - They'll kill you. I know. Can you run? I was all set to. I was at the airport ready to go. Then there was the press conference... ...and there was Richmond... ...using old man Sullivan. I might not have been able to... ...save Christy Sullivan, but... ...I didn't even try. What are you going to do? Don't know, I'll think of something. I watched you argue a case last year. You won it. Thank God, you got your mother's brains. It's dangerous outside. It always is. Excuse me. Give this package to Miss Gloria Russell? - Anything for me to sign? - No. You have an honest face. Oh, my God. You're a vision tonight. Thank you, Mr. President. And... Thank you, Mr. President. For? Come again? You know. You sent it to me this afternoon. Of course. Would you... ...excuse me all? I'm overcome with the desire to dance with my Chief of Staff. - Look after this for me, will you? - Certainly. What is this nonsense? I'm hoping there's an explanation. Your gift. I was... ...overwhelmed... ...and, you know, your note was so gratifying. I sent a note? You think I don't know your writing? I assumed you wanted me to wear it tonight. Gloria, it's lovely... - Thanks. ...and you know what else? What, Alan? Christy wore it the night she was killed. Know what this means? Whitney's been heard from. It's not precisely the first time, Mr. President. You been keeping things from me? It's just that you have so much on your plate, Alan, we wanted to spare you. He sent me a Polaroid of the... ...letter opener yesterday. We'll have to give this some thought. Come to my office in the morning. This'll make an interesting chapter in my memoirs. Do we know who the forger is? I talked to Seth Frank. Apparently, Whitney learned in prison. Gifted man. How close are we to stopping him? We're working around the clock. Well, that's good to know. He'll make a mistake. That's good to know, too. There is... ...one other thing that... ...we need to take care of. He has a daughter, doesn't he? You sure you want to do that? Sir? She's a young prosecutor. Prosecutors ask questions. Maybe she knows what he knows. Let's get cracking, boys. Show that you love your country. How's Kate doing? Where are you? I won't hang around long enough for you to trace the call. Answer the question. She couldn't be in better hands. The Secret Service are taking over surveillance. Doctor Kervorkian, I presume? My guess is that this is in your carotid artery about now. You're going to get a little woozy. If I give you the rest of this... ...it will fry your brain down to the size of a peanut. Drop that. He's my president... ...right or wrong. He made a mistake. You made a mistake. When you went after my little girl, that was unacceptable. Mercy. I'm fresh out. Daddy? Go to sleep, darling. Oh, Jesus. Just one question. When you interviewed Sullivan did he say why Christy didn't go to Barbados? Just that she changed her mind. You know who did it don't you? So will you. Check your phones. Oh, man. Good night, Mr. Sullivan. Are you taking a short cut, Tommy? I'm your substitute driver tonight, Mr. Sullivan. Don't worry about Tommy, he's just fine. Very unusual. What do I call you? Luther, sir. Are you familiar with how to get to my townhouse? Oh, yes, sir. I know where all your houses are. I'm the man who robbed you. You're the man who tried to kill me. I'm sorry I missed. I believe in the Old Testament, sir. There's nothing wrong with an eye for an eye... ...when a terrible deed has been done. A deed such as yours. You'd like to believe that, right? It'd be simple for you to believe that. What do I have to gain by being here? I have no idea. You going to rob me again? I don't need your money, Mr. Sullivan. No, but did you check your vault lately? I put everything back. I'm afraid we're a little late for an attempt at leniency. A lot of crap's coming down tonight. You want to be a player or not? You want to know what happened that night? 'Cause I was there. I want to know. Do you think you could stand hearing about it? How he beat her, tried to strangle her? You really want to know about that? I could walk through fire. I was in the vault when they came in. They were drunk. He started knocking her around. She fought back. He started getting really rough. She tried to defend herself... ...while he started screaming... ...like the sniveling simp he is. Who else was in my house? Secret Service. They're the ones who shot her. Nonsense. Gloria Russell handled the cover-up. Stop this. Don't you want to know who it was? It was you. Come on, Mr. Sullivan, we're too old to bullshit each other. Who was it then? You know. Don't shake your head at me. When you're alone... ...and furious and you want revenge... ...what face do you put with your enemy? Stop the car. No, we're going straight ahead. This is too terrible. Yes, it is. I know about... ...Alan's reputation as a philanderer, but... ...he would never dream of betraying me. I gave him the presidency. Remember that press conference... ...where he put his arm around you... ...and said if Christy hadn't been sick she'd be in Barbados? How the hell did he know she was sick? You didn't tell anyone. It's 'cause she told him... ...that night. I was there. I was watching. That's not real proof. Maybe this is then. You could have stolen this. I did steal it. That's not by blood on there. That's not my prints. I did love her, you know. Geez, Burton. Is he working late? I have no appointment, but I'd like to see him. You don't need an appointment. Let's go, Miss Russell. Come in. We interrupt this program with a breaking story tonight... ...one that is shocking the nation and the world. At the White House, a tragedy has taken place within the hour. Here's our White House correspondent. What can you tell us? Sources close to the White House said Sullivan saw the president tonight. That was for an unscheduled private meeting. You're still here? I'm still here. ...I would not be president. If Christine had not taken ill... ...she'd be with you in Barbados now. Walter, you've been... ...like a father to me. You're seeing President Richmond's last news conference... ...where he outlined his loyalty... ...to philanthropist and friend... ...Walter Sullivan. Sullivan's wife had been murdered. The president vowed to find the killer. Sullivan had a private meeting with the president tonight. Now, to the White House for a live interview. Have you no idea why the president would take his own life? I know he's been feeling the pressure of the office... ...more than ever lately. We talked about it a great deal. But why would he stab himself? That's a question that will haunt me forever. Of course, I... ...tried to stop him. Alan... ...was like a son to me. Was that Seth? Think he'd like to come over for supper when you get well. You don't have to fuss. I know. Am I going to be all right? We'll be just fine.
