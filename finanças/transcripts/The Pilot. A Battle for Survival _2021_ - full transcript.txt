Citizens! During their air raids over our towns the enemy drops numerous fire bombs. These bombs can cause extensive fires. However, prevention of such fires depends primarily on the population. AIR RAID SHELTER Somebody help! Help me! Shut up, you bitch! I'll kill you! Vaga, look out! Drop the gun, pal. I'll cut her throat. You son of a bitch! Stop! The bastards are gone. Are you hurt? You're bleeding. It's okay, you're all right. Just relax, okay? -What is it? -They took my food stamps. I just got them today. Okay, let's get you up. Come on, here we go. It'll all be okay. Let me walk you home. Shota, we're nearby. -Look out for the convoy. -Affirmative, looking out. DEMYANSK To a distant land My dear friend takes flight Our native winds following in the night And his beloved city melts into blue mist I have visual on the convoy! I see the convoy! Get ready, Shota. Hang in there, Nikanor. It's about to get hot. Loaded! How are you doing, Nikanor? Still alive? It's Nikodim, Senior Lieutenant. I'm okay. Just a bit shaken up. It's not easy flying backwards. You did fine for a rookie. Just when will my dear friend return? Our native winds Will surely go to meet him And his beloved city Will surely smile to greet him Messerschmitts, sir! Messerschmitts! Sir, they're turning back! They're beating it! Senior Lieutenant! It's me, Nikodim! Senior Lieutenant! It's me, Nikodim! Nikolay, look! The Messers are on our six! -They're coming at us! -I see them. We're in position. Spread formation! The machine gun's fucking stuck! What's wrong, Ivan, out of ammo? Great job, my friend. Beautiful! We're losing fuel. Preparing to land. Watch out, incoming fighters! Move it! Incoming fighters! Faster, keep going! -Commander! -I know. Shota, the smoke bomb's stuck. -Are we going to make it back to base? -We'll try to land as is. Hang in there, Shota. Nikolay. Nikolay! Shota... We have to torch the plane. Quick, get out! Hurry up! Get out there! Shota, that's enough. Leave the machine gun. She's done for. Here it is... You little fucker... -What's the hold-up? -Germans. The machine gun's not done yet. Now she's done! Cover me! Let's go, Shota. Fire! Fire! Nikolay... Quickly, come on! Shota? -Damn it. -Calm down. We'll report it to the senior lieutenant. He won't get far. MOSCOW DEMYANSK VALDAY VYSHNY VOLOCHYOK MOSCOW Here we are. Bye, Olga. Take care! Goncharova! Tomorrow, seven o'clock sharp. Don't be late! You? I didn't recognize you right away. Well, those anti-tank trenches don't dig themselves. It's been a month since I last flew, but I'm still getting rations. Seems unfair. Anyway... This is for you. What about you? It's fine. We pilots get plenty. I can't. Look. You don't owe me anything. And they took your stamps, didn't they? Oh, and this... I'm Nikolay, by the way. Olga Goncharova. Feldgendarmerie. What the hell are they doing here? There was an air strike, Senior Lieutenant. Fighters. Three men killed. How strange. A pistol-caliber fighter? Where did you find him? In that gulley over there. Under a tree. May I ask what brings you here, Senior Lieutenant? We're looking for a Russian pilot. He's somewhere in this area. I got a new bird today. I'm going to Tushino with my gunner tomorrow to get her. A new bird? Aircraft. An Il-2. Ever heard of it? No. I haven't. It's a test model. There'll be hundreds soon. The Germans call it "The Black Death". What about you? What do you do? SILVA I work there. Goncharova? Operetta theater. You're joking! You thought I was a trench digger? I've never been to an operetta before. Will you show me? It will have to be after the war. The theater was evacuated and I'm... You know... stuck here. Nikolay! -Hi. -Hi. Why didn't you write that you were coming? I didn't know 'til yesterday. But I can't stay. I'm sorry. Looks like it's hello and goodbye in one. What time do you have to leave? Tomorrow at six. Would you come with me? -I have to go. -Just wait a second. You have no idea how hard it is just waiting. Not even knowing where you are or if you're okay. I thought you were hurt once. Here... And here... -Olga... -Wait. You're not alone now. There are two of us. Don't forget that there are two of us. Promise me you'll come back. You know there's a war going on. And I'm a soldier. I know. I do. I know you're the bravest, strongest soldier out there. Promise me you'll come back. Swear it. I promise. Just lie still there, pilot. And don't go grabbing your gun. Keep quiet and stay still, if you want to live. There. Stop. Whoa there! Where's your gun? I don't understand. Your gun? Bang bang! My good soldiers, I don't have a gun. Here. I killed it with this stick. You can't shoot in the forest anymore, you'll get killed. The wolf fell into a pit, then I hit him with this. Right at the back of the neck. Is he saying he killed that thing with a stick? Seems like it. Jesus, what the hell are we doing here? They go around killing wolves with wooden sticks. Tell him to scram. Go on. Move it! Go on! Let's go. Come on. Halt. Go on, sweetheart, bring us some rags and hot water. You can see how bad he is. Go on. Mother of God... -Were those Germans, Dad? -Go get your doctor, and hurry. Nothing to see here. Go look out the window. I don't see anyone out there. Well, Doctor? What's the verdict? I'm a medic. And it's bad. Frostbite. Is he going to die, medic? He needs to be operated on and fast. Can you do it? No. I think he might have double pneumonia. Let's get him into the cellar, Ignat. Dad. Why did you bring him here? He's not going to make it. Just cause us more problems. Look, the medic's going flat out, and all for nothing. You shut your mouth. Quit yammering. He's one of ours. Look at his papers, and the patches on his shirt. And what have you got? A prick in your pants? We're surrounded by the enemy. If you get a Red commander out of here with papers and weapons, they'll look at you differently. There's nowhere to get him out to, Dad. The Germans will take Moscow any day now. If they do, you'll have to get him further. You're not sitting around here, son-in-law or not. You're going to bring the Red Army back here with you. MOSCOW The Germans are here. Hey, blacksmith. Senior Lieutenant requires your help. Oh, okay. Did it break? It's a little bent. Motorbikes don't last long on our roads. Give me a moment. Get to it. -Thank you, you may go. -Yes, Senior Lieutenant. Oh my God... You're pretty fluent in Russian, Officer. That's none of your concern. Don't go running your mouth. We've already got a report on you. It says you're a collective farmer, a Bolshevik. That your son-in-law's in the Red Army. That sergeant got it all wrong. Sir... He's a no-hoper at our language. How can we explain it to him? They put pretty much everyone in collective farms back then. And as for my son-in-law... Yes, he's in the army. But what can you do? He got his summons and that was that. It was back before the war. Why didn't you leave with your people, Bolshevik? Where would I go? This is my home. And where's your son-in-law now? -Who knows? -Quiet! My head. What was that? Rats. It's warm in here. So they keep crawling in. Sure... Rats. Motorbikes don't last long on our roads. Give me a moment. On your feet! Come with me! Against the wall! -What's wrong, Officer? -Face the wall! How far do you think we are from our troops? Who knows? We're heading towards them, but they're headed away from us. Shame, and to think they were right under our noses. They must have set off right away, sir. Just as you entered the house. -Will you be needing my men? -No. The daughter said there's only three of them. The pilot's badly injured. And they have no weapons. We'll set out at dawn. That's them. Footprints are gone. Everything's covered in snow. Senior Lieutenant, should we turn back? They're near. You, 50 meters to the left, and you, to the right. I can't see shit! We should leave him for a while. Go see where we're going next. It's like the goddamn apocalypse. There's a windbreak. About four kilometers ahead. If we head through it, we'll get to where we need to go. If we go right now. We should go back for the captain. Holy shit! We need to get out of here. There have to be more Germans around. This is one hell of a mess you've got me into. Let's give him up to the Germans, can't we? They'll treat us all right. You bastard, I saved you. Took you to my father-in-law. Go to hell, you ungrateful shit! You and that pilot of yours! I'm going to keep on living. Captain! -Freeze! -It's okay, it's just me. I got one of them. -Who did the shooting? -No idea. Maybe him? It wasn't me. It was the pilot! The Red one! I'll show you. You hear that? That's our troops. They're not far off. Just hang in there. It'll get dark soon. -Check out those fireworks! -Got any more smokes? No. Yermek! What you got? Something's crawling our way, Sarge. Could be a German or some animal, not sure. Maybe it's an alligator? What are you waiting for? -Go check. Take Philippov with you. -Yes, sir. What is it No idea. Maybe an animal, maybe a German... They're our boys, Sarge. Come on, help him in. Okay, here we go... Grab him. -He's not dead, is he? -He's breathing. We made it. Get on in, buddy. I told you we'd make it. Okay, careful now. We need a medic here! It's too late... Captain Komlev, pilot. Gangrene in both ankles, gunshot wound to the right shin, laceration to the forearm. Double pneumonia, partial soft-tissue frostbite. -Is that everything? -Yes. So you're taking me to an autopsy? I'm a surgeon, not a pathologist. His heart's beating just fine. Well, mine's going to give out soon. I can't stand watching them die on me. You awake, buddy? -Water... -What? Water. Are you allowed water? What did the doctors say? Okay, just a second. You're awake? Yes. My legs hurt. Nurse! -Can I get a shot? -No, honey. You have to wait a little. Nurse! You got to... tough it out, you know. My arm... was also... on fire at first. I thought to myself, why the burning? It's gone. Fuck this war, right, buddy? But look at it this way, you could have died, but you didn't. It's like a second chance, a second life. Everything will be alright. Time's a great healer. NIKOLAY KOMLEV Saratov Orphanage. Nikolay! Petrovich is here. -Kadkov! -Over here! -Kolmykov! -Here! Yevseev! He's dead. Three days ago. -Dzhamaliev! -That's me. -Zakharov! -Here! That's all, comrades. No more for today. Let me help. Bring the wounded over here. Who's wounded? Bring him in here. He's bleeding. Come on, let's go. The Hitler gang's reckless politics are costing the Germans millions of lives on the Soviet-German front. Millions? Really? OLGA, MY LOVE AIR RAID SHELTER SILVA These are for you. The doctor will help you try them on. The concert's starting soon. Nechayeva's arrived. She's incredible. Do you want me to take you? Welcome, comrades! All right, I have to go. Today, our principal ensemble from the Moscow Theater will perform a patronage concert for you. To open, we present to you the renowned performer, Honored Artist of the Republic, and multiple laureate Nadezhda Nechayeva! Accompanied by our theater's artists Lidiya Maksimova and Olga Goncharova. Please welcome them! Thank you. Comrades! My dear friends. I'd like to begin today's concert with a song to the music of Matvienko. Lyrics by Andreyev. "You and I are Predestined to Meet Again." You and I share this heartfelt conviction I feel certain inside that it's true You and I are predestined to meet again Just as soon as this long war is through You and I are predestined to meet again Just as soon as this long war is through The wounded night sky Will heal when the dawn arrives We'll be shielded from bullets by fate You and I are predestined to meet again How my heart overflows as I wait! Though parting is such terrible misery As our own native land lies ablaze -What's the matter? -What? You and I are predestined to meet again Why didn't you write that you were coming? You have no idea how hard it is just waiting. What's the matter? Promise me you'll come back. Swear it. You and I are predestined to meet again Victory shines through war's dreadful haze Have no fear This will all soon have been and gone Though to triumph There's a hard road to hew You and I are predestined to meet again Just as soon as this long war is through You and I are predestined to meet again Just as soon as this long war is through Thank you, comrades! And a speedy recovery! -Thank you. -Goodbye. Oh, it's you... I've seen all of her movies. She's amazing, isn't she? You know, I have a dream. I want to see Nadezhda on the stage. In a real theater. I'm Val ya, by the way. -Lidiya. -Olga. -Come see us! -Are you sure? Of course. And there we go. You've overreached yourself. Your wounds will open up and... And it will all go to waste. No getting up for a week. Take the prostheses to my office. Overall though, not bad at all. You'll probably be walking faster than me soon. Will I be able to fly, Doctor? I doubt it. Although, I heard about an English pilot like you... They say he flies with prosthetics. Really? Well, the English don't report to me. Maybe he does, maybe he doesn't. I will. N. KOMLEV Thanks so much for the tickets! I haven't been to the theater since before the war. You know, I was in drama club at school. Hello. Do you know each other? I brought free tickets to the theater. And you're here... So you're alive... But then why... I don't know how to say it, Olga. I'd better go. We lost a tanker in August. Goodbye, Nikolay. They operated three times. Such a shame, he didn't make it to summer in the end. You know, Captain Komlev wants to play football soon... -On his prosthetic legs. -Prosthetic legs? -He lost his legs? -Well, yes. I amputated them myself in the winter. You've got to be kidding. How did it go? I've been discharged. It's okay. I'll go all the way to Kalinin himself. -What is this? -What? "Dear Mom and Dad, I'm doing all right. Dad, I'm performing surgeries on my own now." As a general and a big man in medicine, I hope you're proud to know that. I even took an appendix out. Imagine that, appendicitis happens in war too. Some catch bullets, some catch appendicitis. It's odd. This whole war is a paradox. I've got a wounded pilot here with me. Medically speaking, he should have been dead a while ago. But he's alive. The two of us are here and we're both alive. What's next? I try not to think about that. The two of us are here and we're both alive. "What's next? I try not to think about that. The war does its job and I do mine. Once I'm transferred. I'll send you the new unit ID code. I miss you a lot. Yours, Misha." To be honest... I can't picture him in uniform. And there are no photographs. Permission to speak? Divisional Military Doctor, sir? Permission granted. Are you out of your mind? How are you going to fly? How? You can't even walk without a cane. And you want to fly. It's out of the question. It's entirely impossible! The English pilot Douglas Bader kept on flying. The exception only proves the rule. Yes, but this exception can fight and shoot down German planes. Misha saved you so that you could live. You must live on. Live a long life. A life has to be worth living. When I was crawling down there in the woods, I wanted to live so that I could fight. Defeat the Nazis. For my partner Shota. For your son. For her. Why don't you say something? Surely you must understand. My husband's a pilot. And a pilot has to fly. Now wait, come on, really. Captain! -Halt! -Seventh! Attention! Good morning, Major! -Is the Yak-9 ready? -They didn't send any oil coolers. -Did you go to the division? -It's been crazy here, sir. I didn't have time. Didn't have time? And time to drink? The Yak isn't ready, but you had time for booze? It wasn't for fun, sir. I was up all night checking the engines were warm. I was so cold, I had to warm up. Look, get to the division, do whatever it takes, cry, beg, I don't care. But have that Yak ready by tonight! -Understood? -Yes sir, understood. Good morning, Major! Listening to romantic songs, are we? No, sir. Radio chatter. Sounds like a pincer movement. -Who's caught in it? -A pilot and a gunner. -Sounds like an Il-2, I think. -"I think"? Well, don't go thinking too hard there. Probably from the Third Assault Regiment, sir. Twenty kilometers away. There they are! I've been hit! -Can you see the Messer? -One's turning, coming in on our 6! Sir, ammo's running low, two reloads and we're out. Let's get out of here! The Messer's close. The guys are dead! The plane's as good as gone! -We're done for! -Get reinforcements up there! Start the engine! Captain, I've got no ammo! Did you hear me? I'm out! We're in the hot zone, sir. There's nobody here. Resuming our search. We'll find them. Looks like we lost them. There's the bridge. We've still got two missiles, we can try. Are you crazy? Let's get out of here! Those weren't my orders. I was ordered to destroy the bridge. There's a Messer on our tail! There they are. How the hell about that! Number Five, it's Number One. We're coming home. Oh, I see. He's wasted. No, he isn't. You think I'm blind? He can barely stand on his feet! He hasn't got any. Those are prosthetic legs.
