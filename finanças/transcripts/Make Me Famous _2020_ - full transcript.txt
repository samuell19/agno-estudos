I dumped him. Why? Why stay with Robin when Batman's got a bigger cape? Did you see him again? No, he read my WhatsApp messages but didn't reply. He blue tick ghosted me! You dated any other celebs? You've seen my Instagram. Like, what do you think? So I was like, yeah, of course I'll spend what I can on her - she was my girlfriend. I know the difference between love and lust. What's that? Well, love is matching Rolexes, and lust is a Michael Kors! Describe your type, Michelle. My type? Just like this. Like what? Like a good brew - someone warm and sweet, someone my mum will get on with, you know?! If she doesn't like them, they've got no chance. What I really need is a summer, you know, a break from my job, meet a couple, three or four new girls, give my mum a rest, but if you want someone to mix it up... ..you're welcome. And how do you plan to mix it up? Anything for the story. This way. Guys, this way! Get closer in, closer in, that's it. Come on, Billy, tell us a joke. That's it. Well done, everybody. Billy? Can I get a selfie? Yeah, of course. Thank you. Cheers. Yeah, yeah. All right. Once more, once more. Much better, Sam! Yeah, all right, I like that one. Yeah, of course. Thank you. Nice to meet you. Yes, guys, it's Billy here with your midday motivation. If you haven't had your Power Pra... Shit! Power Protein Powder. Power Protein Powder. Power Protein Powder. Yes, yes, guys! Midday motivation with Billy. You had your Power Protein Powder yet? Get it down you! 20 off link in my bio, yeah? PHONE SWOOSHES What if he doesn't have an off switch? Eventually, every performance ends. I think there's more - more than he's shown us so far, and if we could just... KNOCK, DOOR OPENS Hey! Am I too early? Come in, Billy. Thanks for coming down again. Yeah, no worries. Flexitime at work. Hm. Just in case. I mean, you never know, right? How's it going, Kel? I'm all right, Billy, yeah. So... So? Am I packing in my job or what? We showed our bosses your tape, and they love you. We just wanted to run through a few bits before any final decisions are made. Yeah, yeah, sweet. So... ..why do you want to be on the show, Billy? What, you kidding? Did you see the last series? Does look like a lot of fun, and you can do very well out of it. But... Yeah, no disrespect or anything, but that lot last year were crap! Mm. I cast last year's show, Billy. Oof! Well, then, you cast a bunch of planks! No, I mean, no offence, Kel, I'm sure they were nice people, but none of them were a must-watch. And you are? Well, I didn't do anything for the last ten seconds and you two kept staring, so you tell me. You're not in just yet, so... Oh, come on! You ain't got a show without me, babe! Listen, you've got a real shot here, but we need to make sure you're across the process. What's to know? Well, if you make it, it'll be the best summer of your life, hands down. Mm. You wouldn't have to lift a finger. Love that! Your phone - we'd need to take it for the duration. Yeah, yeah, sweet, whatever. There'll be no books, magazines, laptops or tablets. This is a no-brand house, so you wouldn't be able to pack your favourite logos. You can't even talk about brands. We'll be in constant contact, but you cannot talk about the production. You can work out. There's free clothes, if you want them. Booze and birds too. The cameras watching wouldn't slow you down, right? Billy, this isn't an interview - it's just a chat. Yeah, it's just the first chat I've had with a camera in my face, so... All you've got to do is show up, get on with the other lads and, you know, fancy one of the girls. Or more than one. I can do that. Countdown to reality legend Billy in the house! Got to be on it tonight, Bill. This lot are paying properly. What have I always said? Really, Gaz? Yes, really. PAs are my bread-and-butter. 3K for a couple of hours of free drinks and selfies, so wake up, Bill! The new series being on air isn't good for us. Anyone else doing tonight? Just you, mate. First evictions were a few weeks ago, and the cast from your year are old news. You're not. Contract's for two tweets, though. What? The tweets. What, you need me to... Piss off, Gaz! Can I bloody trust you to get the right hashtags up? It was one time! It was three times, Bill. Three copy and paste cockups. Yeah, what my followers love. I'm... A bloody liability? Relatable. You know brands don't expect your fee copy and pasted into a tweet? You sure? Cos I think the last one got 1,500 retweets. Relatable. CHANTING: Down it! Down it! Down it! Down it! Yes! Are you ready for the big one? Romford, what are you saying?! Ladies, let me hear you scream! THEY SCREAM Mate! I'm not sure about this. No, no. It was a stupid idea. You could have said no, but you didn't. I should have put these through a shredder! Oh, give us a look first and you can shred them after. I'm not leaving them here! Come on! No! Yeah, 14 years old. Kieran Buckfield's birthday party at Cally Pool. But you're... Fat? Yeah, it's all right, you can say it. I used to get teased for having bigger boobs than the girls. So what happened to this Billy? Billy Boobs? I killed him. Yeah, he died. I decided to build me - this me. So who were you when you were 14? Fat Billy. I mean, that's literally who I was. There was Billy Sellick, and he was blonde, crap at maths but amazing at football, so he was Billy. And you can't have more than one Billy, so, yeah, I was Fat Billy, Billy Boobs. And who are you now? Billy Fearon - the star of your show. You just won't admit it yet. Shit! Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. It's on silent. Um... Sorry. Sorry, it's off. Who was it? What, are you the police? You'd be surprised how many people pretend to be single to get on the show. I've seen more angry girlfriends... Yeah, it was my mum. Are you two close? She's my mum. Do I have a choice? Hold on! Isn't that Billy? Oh, my God, it probably is! Let's ask him for a selfie! Hey, Billy, do you mind if we have a picture? Yeah, of course you can. Thank you! Cheers. There you go. Seedless - I didn't forget. Mm! Did you get my... Yeah, it's all in the kitchen - all the stuff you're allowed, plus the biscuits, the chocolates and the sweets that you're probably going to munch when no-one's looking - but don't worry, I won't tell anyone you're cheating. I'll have you know I am taking the Team Diet very seriously. Yeah, of course you are. The state of your hair! You know, you used to love these... Yes, yes, you lot! Back at Mum's flat and, yes, you guessed it - she is living her best life in her pink slippers! Yeah, I'll be living my best life when you stop filming me in my work clothes! You look fine. I look like I lost a fight with a hairbrush. Er, bloody cheek! Ah, you love it! You're more popular on my own page than me! Yeah, too bloody right! Hey, well done for yesterday. Yeah, it's nothing. Nah, kids really appreciate it, lovey. Mum, it's your work, all right? Anything you need. How's the flat? Er, it's a penthouse apartment! Er, it's a flat! It's home. Yeah, well, whatever it is, I'm glad you're putting your money to good use. William? William, here! All right, it's off. Yeah, of course it is. You didn't need to get me all of that stuff, either. I don't want you wasting your PR money on me. Look, I told you I'd buy a place, and I have. And they're PAs, Mum - public appearances. Yeah, well, I don't bloody well know, do I? I'm still getting booked, even though a new series just started, all right? And Gaz says that doesn't usually happen. When do they start booking the new lot? Oh! The world doesn't need any more boys in lady leggings, surely? You seem like the kind of guy who needs his own space, though. I get all the freedom I need. Mum's cool. Who else am I going to watch Downton with? You watch Downton? Yeah, all right, all right! Don't tweet it or anything! It's one of our shows. There are some tougher questions we need to get through, Billy. Mm. It's a bit of a joke in the office. We call it the talk of doom. Sounds dramatic. It's more about us dreading asking such personal questions, really, but we have to. Duty of care. Steph? Billy, what's your relationship with drugs? What? Drugs - do you take any? What, do I look high or something? I have a feeling this is you totally sober. What, have you never even had a cheeky spliff? No, not for me. High on life, babe. Are you a control freak, Billy? What, cos I don't get high? It's a choice, Kel. I made mine. Do you have a history of mental illness or anxiety? Nah. I mean, right now, you might be causing... Sorry, bad joke. Er, no. I said no. Jesus! Yes, yes, guys! Now, I know you don't normally see me at these fancy events, but she has only gone and launched Moves By Michelle... No! What? Moods - it's Moods By Michelle. Can I have two cocktails? Yeah, sure. Here, custom cocktail. Barmaid said it's lit. Look, I think I'm going to start to try and cut, mate, you know, I'm involved enough, so I'll probably... Michelle's over there. Make sure you get a photo with her. Oi, Bill! Get a photo! Yeah, all right, I'll get it in a bit! She's doing all right. Shop floor to designer. Didn't she used to work retail before the show? In Topshop, yeah. She's played it perfectly, Bill. This is where I see you, mate. Look, let's get together next week and work on your brand. Oi, Bill! Yeah? Brand. Cool, yeah. I'll be back in a sec. Is that Billy? That's Billy! How's it going, Mr Lover Man? You sound like the papers. They're back together, guys! Look! We love you two! Aw! Give the public what they want, eh? Congrats on the party. Well, the clothes, I mean. I did nothing. I said yes and no to some drawings and colours, and now I'm a designer. Who knew? Ah, good work if you can get it. I actually wasn't going to... Don't you dare! What? Make out like you weren't going to come! Why are you always so... Busy! ..full of shit? You graduated from all that PA bollocks yet? Yeah, I'm not you, Chelle. Popular? Smart. Well, smart enough to do all this. I keep telling you to meet with my manager. Let me set it up for you. You can do anything, Bill! What's taking you so long? Anything? How about I buy you a drink? It's a free bar. Oh, all right. You twisted my arm. I'll get you a bottle, then. Two minutes? You've got one and a half. Oh, you shouldn't have! And I heard it's the only thing we get to show up at these days. What, a free bar? So, er, why didn't you and that Michelle ever get together? Well, everyone saw what happened on the show with the whole... No, no, I don't mean on the show. Once you were out, for real. It just never happened, I guess. Well, how about you make some time for me, then? When would you want to...? They gave me a driver. Let's go back to yours, see what happens. HE GRUNTS What time is it? Er... Seven. Just gone. I should go. Hm! So the sponsored posts haven't slowed down. Tidy income. Yeah, well, the real money's in partnerships. Once you know that you're... Yeah, don't tell me - algorithms. Ah! Not just a pretty face. Well, if you don't have a game plan, what's the point, right? The cast on my series learnt that from your lot. Everything's an opportunity, babe. Everything. Don't judge - I didn't have time for a spray tan. Look, I've really got to go. He'd bloody better still be outside! But this was fun. DM me, yeah? HE SIGHS HE GRUNTS CHIME CUTS OFF HE CLEARS THROAT Yes, yes, you lot! Morning from the penthouse! Well, fifth floor, but let's pretend we're at the top, yeah? Check out my view pre the freeness. Now, the first thing I'm going to do when I finally get out of this bed is smash a shaker of the good stuff - Powder... Fuck's sake! HE SIGHS HE SIGHS Billy! Twat! You wanker! Ha-ha! Cheers. Do you want a bag? Er, two, yeah. Wait! Hey, where do I know you from? Er, don't know. Nah, you know, fam! What show is it? Yeah, can I just get the... Don't be like that! Come on, man! What show? Bro... Wait! I know you! It's you, innit? You're banter, bruv! Hold on, let me get you on my Snap. One sec. Mate, not right now, OK? I've got to go. What? You're famous, man, you know what to do! Just say hi. Mate... What? What? Take a picture. TILL BEEPS BANGING CONTINUES 15 missed calls? Well, it was 12, but... What? Do I really need to explain what's wrong with this picture? It's minimalist. Are you ghosting me? I was asleep. Plus, what, 12 missed calls, really? You not checked your Insta? Yeah, I don't get as many likes as you, so... And my screen time thing's saying I'm doing three hours a day... Screen time says I'm doing seven hours, Billy, but you know what? It pays the bills. HE SIGHS Turning your notifications on. Check your messages. "Looks like the charm of serial shagger Billy Fearon "only got him so far "as the Love Or Lust star wooed evictee Helen Cott, 22, "at LOL favourite Michelle Bachelor's clothing launch." What? Saw you talking to her and I wanted to stop you. Yeah, but you didn't. I didn't tell you to leave with her, did I? She said I was clumsy and stank of booze. Why would she say that? It's no different than the show. If it's a better story, it runs - exactly like when we got together. And the night after, it was another girl, and the night after that... Well, I'm forever the rat that broke your heart! I messed up, Chelle! I know I did. And now half the country hates me, but you're doing all right. Chelle, I was edited and produced! They're not producing you now. I was exactly who they wanted in those interviews. I was that cocky prick they wanted on screen. What if they didn't want that? What about if they wanted what I saw? Has it ever occurred to you I got with one guy in ten weeks - you? The real Billy. Doesn't exist. The papers saw through that. The papers? They said I was a slag! My mum had to read that - but when I got home, I was in charge. In charge of what? I've got blue ticks, millions of followers, and I can't even pay my fucking phone bill! You know, I'm taking PAs for less and less cos there's a new version of me on TV that is younger, better looking and watched by more people than either of us were! I spoke to my people about you. They want to meet with you. Go and see them. You're better than this, Billy! Yeah, but am I, though? Would you even touch me now? We don't match any more. Yeah, cos I'm bad for your fucking brand. I'm saying you're better than this! People love you. Call him. Jay will help everything. Bloody hell, Billy! Those videos are about fitness, Kel! Even this one in your pants? Gym shorts, Steph - shorts! Do you think your appearance matters? You tell me. You like people seeing what you want them to. No-one asks a guy who looks like me any real questions, you know? I'm not supposed to have anything to say. Could you handle the attention? You think I don't get attention? Four million people watched the final last year. And they all want to be entertained. That's why I'm here. So, what does that mean? It means I won't hold back. I'm an open book. What's in the book? A long massage, happy ending. What? No secrets, no scars - I'm normal. Just as fucked up as everyone else. Right. Well, what our cast do, literally, makes our show, and... And you want a good story? Look, I ain't afraid to have a good time, all right? I'll crack on. Just line them up, I'll knock them down, babe. Look, Billy, we'll never tell you what to say or do, but it is important we know you're comfortable with suggestions. Talking points. Talking points? To get to know the real you. People who are themselves on screen do really well, Billy. Are you happy being you on camera? Well, isn't that what I'm doing now? How was your shift? Long. Is everything OK? Yeah, of course. Well, good. So I googled you, and... Oh, Mum! I told you not to! The show was supposed to give you options, but this... I thought... Yeah, well, so did I. Michelle seems to be doing really well. Yeah, I'm not her. The papers say she's earning more than the winners! The winners never really win, Mum. I saw the video of your flat. The penthouse looks like it needs a royal wipe-down. Wait, wait... You're following me? And Michelle - I mean, she seems so happy. I thought I'd see you two on This Morning by now, not flogging some muscle powder. Mum! The things they're saying about you in the comments, William... How are you handling it? You don't even talk about it. Yeah, I don't care what some random has to say, and mates - I've got mates, we talk. This world you're in - I can't begin to understand it, but it all seems so...hard! Your dad never opened up, and he never asked for help. And I know how you get when you... Yeah, you don't have to worry about me, Mum. I'm not him. All right? We're ready for you now. Sorry for the wait. Conference call with... You don't care about that. I'm Jay, Michelle's day-to-day, and Lou - well, Louisa is... I'm a big fan. Thanks so much for coming in. Michelle speaks really highly of you. Yeah? Don't sound so surprised! You two made your series watchable. It's what you do next that counts, and we're in a business of maximising the platform you've built. So, how can we help? Um... Well, I've been eyeing up a new Bentley, so... Er... No, seriously, um, you know, I get the algorithm thing, um... I just kind of want to do more than socials - more than sponsored posts, I mean. Well, you're in the right room. So we know, how do you currently define your brand? What, from serial shagger? Um... No, it's just the papers. Um... Yeah, OK, er... Brand. Um... Yeah, I'm more like jeans and trainers than, like... ..more than, like, you, mate, you know. I couldn't wear all that. I mean, you look great in the brogues and stuff, but, um, yeah, trainers really hit the spot. Plus these skinny jeans do wonders for the... Well, he knows! You know, I think what Jay was getting at was values - so, what's most important to you, how you're seen. You know, Michelle's relationship with her mum is key to her demo, so we don't have to sell the fact that she's vulnerable, that she's layered. You know, Michelle will stop to take selfies and it's really those little unspoken qualities that brands are looking for. So, with that being said, what do you think keeps people interested? Interested in Billy? HE SWALLOWS HARD Well, I didn't do anything for the last ten seconds and... ..you two kept staring, so... You tell me. Billy, thanks so much for coming in. We've got to run to our three o'clock. But we'll be in touch. DOOR OPENS AND SHUTS Any danger? Yeah, I'll get you one. Ooh, I'll grab a coffee, if you're going. Cheers. Is this the part where you seduce me, then? Spoiler alert! No. ..is the right answer. SHE CHUCKLES God, I'd MeToo you so fast, I wouldn't even need this show. You're doing so well, Billy. Really. And the more we get on tape, the more our bosses will... Kel... She ain't giving anything away. Am I in or what? It's off. What do you want to get out of this? What do you think? I think you're like everyone I grew up with. I think you're me a few years ago. Yeah? And who's that, then? Someone still figuring it all out. Look, TV gave me a career and not the one my teachers said I'd have! So, what do you want? Cos if you end up doing this, you can do anything. I don't know. Something. Something else. Like what? HE EXHALES I'm in recruitment. Like, that's it. You know, I don't do... I'm not... I didn't think it would go this way for me. And if I make it on the show, I'm quitting. I thought you liked your job. I was never going to wear a high vis, was I? I was going to wear a shirt to work, and I do. And if I was like half my mates, I'd just ride it out, climb a ladder to a nicer suit. What does your dad do? Did. He was the kind of man I'm not. What kind of man? Weak. He was weak. Everyone thinks they'll get rich signing with brand people. Not everyone's a brand, Bill. Some people have a wicked year and... ..that's your lot. Yeah. Yeah. So you've heard. Bill, you've had a good run, but you're out of a contract with us after this and there's not much left in the diary, so... Keep setting those alarms and posting the brands on time. You've still got your old life waiting for you. So if it doesn't work out with Chelle's lot, just... ..start again. Still got it. HE SNIFFS Beer, please. Thanks, Pete. You're welcome, take care. Hey, Pete! Cool. I have a few... MUSIC DROWNS SPEECH Jesus. Billy, if you're on screen, they'll love you, they'll judge you... Laugh with you. Sometimes laugh at you. What if they hate me? KEL LAUGHS I don't think you'll have that problem. Why would they hate you, Billy? They like people to be themselves. Yeah, you keep saying that, but... ..what does that mean? It just means, "be yourself", that's all. HIS BREATHING QUICKENS HE SIGHS Shit! Billy! How's it going, Imran? Oh, what's happening, man? I thought we'd never see you again! Aren't you supposed to be, like...? Yeah, bruv. We watched the show, man. You smashed it! There was some proper stunners in there, Bill. So, uh, you going to lend me your Ferrari? Yeah, Ims, um... Or are you going to hand out some Rolexes? Yeah, I need to speak to Cas. Is he in today? Cas? Yeah. Wh... Why do you want to speak to Cas? I just, um... Look, is he in? Yeah... Is everything all right, bro? Yeah, yeah, I'm cool. I just, um... It's calm. Let me get him, yeah? Give me a sec. BILLY CLEARS HIS THROAT D! Yeah, is Cas about? Billy's here, wants to have a chat. Yes, that Billy. Yeah, I know. Probably not, but... Look, Cas, yeah? Safe. PHONE DISCONNECTS Uh, someone's getting him and you can take a seat. It was... It was good to see you. Yeah, you too. PHONE CAMERA CLICKS Now, then! I thought they were joking! Sorry to disappoint. So? How can we help? Are you just in for a little "hello" or...? Cas, I'm, uh... Look, is there any openings? Openings, as in...? I was wondering if there was anything I could do. What, here? As...in... A job? Oh, look, Billy, we're not... I know recruitment, Cas. How many new employees can just slot right in? I'll do phones, whatever, just... I worked here for three years and... And you left. Very suddenly. If I'm honest, you left us in a bit of a hole. I couldn't say no. It was an opportunity... We saw. We can't expect clients to take us seriously. What's that supposed to mean? Well, would you hire the guy you've watched snog and... ..get drunk and shag his way through the summer? It's TV! Yeah, and this job isn't! Come on, Cas, it's me. I just... I just... ..don't think your values align with the company's. I mean, it's great to see that you haven't forgotten where you come from! You know, and pop by the office any time, yeah? I'm sure the lasses would love to see you! Hey? PHONE ALARM RINGS HE SIGHS ON VOICEMAIL: Hi, William. It's Mum. Uh... Well, I just wanted to see how you were, love. Oh, and I was thinking, how about I pop round and give the flat a nice clean for you? I know you've got a lot on... ..but we could have a laugh together, couldn't we? HE SNIFFLES Call me back, love. HE SNIFFLES, EXHALES HARD Oof, love a burnt coffee. Poured it, Kel, didn't make it. SHE SIGHS CONTENTEDLY You can see it now, can't you? I can see the kid in the photo. I don't think he's ever talked about how he feels, like, ever. Exactly. He hides it well, but he doesn't know himself yet. That's why they'll love him. You guys still talking about me? Oh, Steph was going on about your fitness videos again. Seriously? A little professionalism, yeah? I'm not a piece of meat. KEL GIGGLES Is there anything you want to ask us? Are you single? SHE SIGHS Billy... Anything? At all? What happens if I do something... ..I don't know, dumb? Like what? I just... If I make it... ..am I going to be all right? That's why we're here. Billy, mate? Billy! Hey, you want a picture, yeah? Mate, you smashed it on the show! Yeah, let's just get a picture. No, no, no... You don't get it. I mean, the way you jumped from bed to bed last summer was insane. Yeah, mate, I've got to go. Lucky bastard! You had them lining up! How do you get away with that?! I bet your DMs are mad. Are you still smashing that Michelle? Oh, come on, mate, look, why not? I get it. Why have one bird, innit? PHONE CAMERA CLICKS You're living the dream, pal! Yeah, cheers... Wait, what's it like? HE SNIFFS # Don't you know I'm no good for you? # I've learned to lose you can't afford to # Tore my shirt to stop you bleedin' # But nothin' ever stops you leavin' # Quiet when I'm coming home I'm on my own HE INHALES SHAKILY # Don't you know too much already? # I'll only hurt you if you let me # Call me friend, but keep me closer # And I'll call you when the party's over # Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own # And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that # Yeah, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that # But nothin' is better sometimes # Once we've both said our goodbyes # Let's just let it go # Let me let you go # Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own # Once we've both said our goodbyes # Let's just let it go # Let me let you go # Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own # I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that # I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that. # HE SNIFFLES HE EXHALES HEART MONITOR BEEPS Hi. I was, um... You OK, Amanda? I think you should leave it a couple more days before you... Amanda, my phone hasn't stopped. DISBELIEVINGLY: Oh. Everything from charities to brands to the mags and TV shows that wouldn't even sniff in his direction. They all want Billy now. So what shall I tell them? Billy? Sorry, hi. Got stuck in a team meeting. Our bosses aren't great at keeping it short. Well, I've nipped out the office early, so, go on... What's so urgent? You get my STI results? Wait, wait, wait... I swear Steph only laughs on a full moon. What is going on? Well, we got you in and made you wait because... You're on. You've made it! What? I literally... I don't know what to... It all changes from here, Billy. Yeah? Welcome to the show! You're going to love it. So, what happens next?
