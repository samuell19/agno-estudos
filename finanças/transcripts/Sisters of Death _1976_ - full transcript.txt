Sisters, the pledges are ready. Pledges Judy Peak, and Liz Clybourn you have successfully completed your terms as pledges, and are upon the threshold of being initiated into the secret society of sisters. You have only to pass the final test, the test of courage. Upon becoming members of this society, you are immediately bound by the vows of obedience and secrecy you have taken as pledges. Any breach of these vows carries its due punishment of which you have been told. You are reminded that acceptance of these vows is for life, and therefore not to be taken lightly. Do you wish to be so bound? I do. I do. Sister initiator, proceed with the final test. Judy Peak, this pendant signifies your initiation into the sisters. Welcome to the sisters, Judy. [screaming] I have put a stop to those nasty rumors. Well, the only way to do that is to get him to marry me. They must be insane. [screaming] [phone ringing] Yes? WOMAN [ON PHONE]: Sylvie Woodworth, please. Do you have a wife? Yeah, I'll bet. Yes, this is Miss Woodworth. Sylvia, this is Judy Peak. Judy, this is a surprise. Oh, is it? SYLVIA [ON PHONE]: Yes, I got your invitation yesterday. Very clever, Judy. But it must have cost you a fortune. You I think sent those out? Oh, now, Judy, come on. I love games, and I think the reunion idea's great. But even if it wasn't your idea, you still got to be involved. I don't know anyone else in our little clique with that kind of money. The only question I have is, why Pasa Robles? Sylvia, listen. I did not sent out those invitations. I have had nothing to do with this. Do you understand? Hey, you're really upset. What's the matter? What's the matter? Sylvia, look. I can't talk about it over the telephone. Do you think you could come to my-- to my place? Well, yes, but I'm living at the Switzer Plaza, suite 105. Do you think you can make it about 8 o'clock? All right. JUDY [ON PHONE]: Thanks, Sylvia. Mm. Oh, wise spirit of truth, guide me. For I am about to enter the Valley of Darkness, the darkness of my life past. Why do I feel I have to see them again? The spirit of truth tells me it is wrong. If I go, I'll bring death. And yet I feel another truth, telling me I should go and join them. Penny, there is no true anywhere. The true is nowhere to be seen. You think that you have seen the true, then your seeing is not a true one. Wear this always, Penny. Where you going at? The Pasa Robles Inn. Yo conozco lugar. I take you there. Como se llama? Steve. Uh, Diane Hocum. Oh, Diana. Muy bonito nombre. Quiere musica? Musica? Si, musica. Oh, music? Si! [music plays] [siren wails] Good morning. Hi. May I see your driver's license, please? Yes, officer. Francis-- how do you pronounce your last name? WOMAN [ON PHONE]: Tomalillo. It's Italian. Going too fast, huh? Certainly were, ma'am. I clocked you at 80 miles an hour. Oh. Well, look, officer, sir, please. You know, I've just got to get to Pasa Robles by noon. I've been driving all night, and I haven't stopped for any meals or anything. This will only take a few minutes. Well, if you really wanna know, I've got to get to a ladies' room. I'll write fast. Look, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to speed. Please, officer. You've got to believe me. I'm desperate! I can't wait. If I don't get to a ladies' room fast, I know what's gonna happen. Young lady, that's the oldest story on the road. I've heard it twice today. Officer, I am not kidding. Now, if you won't let me get to a ladies' room, would you mind directing me to the nearest bush? I'm ready to burst. All right. All right. I'll let you go this time. You'll find a gas station down the road a few miles. Oh, you big sweetheart. You know, I always knew there wasn't any truth to that police brutality stuff. Oh boy. Looks like we're the only ones to show up. That's probably two of 'em now. Are you kidding me? Did you see the bodies on those chicks? You're thinking some guy's gonna pay us $500 to pick up five lovely ladies like that? Ours'll probably look bleh. We'll see. Let's check inside. What time is it? Relax. We got a few minutes yet. Mark, don't you think something's weird about this whole thing? Joey, we've got $250. We pick up five chicks, and bring 'em to somebody's house. And we pick up to $250 more. That's all. Some guy we never met, or somebody. What's the matter with you? Huh? What about Acapulco, Vegas, Miami? We get those jobs out of the wanted ads? No, but I just feel a little weird about this whole thing. [car pulls up] I'll bet you that's number three. Mmm. Job's starting to look a little better to you? That's nice. Penny! Diane, hi! Boy, am I glad to see a familiar face. Well, it's about time. Are the other girls coming? Hey, Penny and Diane. Hi! Where have you been? Hey. Hello, you two. One to go. [chattering] That's it. Let's go. Say! Ladies, excuse me. [whistle] Uh, excuse me, ladies. You all part of a group called "the Sisters?" Yeah, why? Hi, I'm Joe. This is my friend, Mark. I'm Mark Robertson. And we're gonna drive you to your destination. I thought this was our destination. Well, consider us, well, the welcoming committee. Let me take these. OK. I'll take your bag. Uh-uh. I'm not getting into some strange car with a couple of guys I've never seen before. Well, I'm not standing out here all day. Judy? Neither am I. Come on. Hey, Penny, don't be afraid. You won't be alone. We're all gonna go together. And strange cars are my specialty. And besides, he's cute. Come on. Come on. Come on. Let's go. [chattering] Whether anybody knows it or not, we've been traveling for over an hour! Hey, fellas. I wanna know where we're going. Relax, relax. We'll be there soon. Just following the map. Right, Mark? Right, stop worrying, girls. This is it, ladies. Where in the world are we? It looks deserted. Looks like we're in the middle of nowhere. Look, I'm through playing games. What is this place? Lady, believe me. It's the first time I've seen it too. Well, ladies. I guess this about as far as we go. I mean, Joey and me. What is going on? Hey, hold it. Maybe this'll explain it. I'll see you. Let's go. Welcome, Sisters, to Hacienda Del Sol. We wish you all a very happy seven year reunion. We hope you will find the accommodations to your liking. Enjoy yourselves. Ladies, enjoy yourselves. Will you look at that. I don't believe this. Incredible. [chattering] Nothing but the best! Everybody grab a glass. I'm pouring. My dream's come true. Looks to me like someone was expecting us, girls. I don't care who planned this. My compliments. Penny? No, thank you. A toast to the Sisters! No. No? There's a party going on. We haven't been invited. Since when do we need an invitation? We never crashed a party before? Please, for me. I'll even drive. You're a good person. Has it ever occurred to you that maybe their boyfriends set this up? Good thinking. Joe. Shh. What? OK. OK. But if one person says one thing, we split. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. [chattering] Well, Commando Kelly, looks like your party's over. Mm-mm. Joey! Come here. See this? Mhm. And this? Mhm. Nothing, right? But I don't trust light bulbs. Disbeliever. Oh, you really are horny, aren't you? Are we gonna let this great pool go to waste? I mean, are we? You just happen to have a bathing suit? We don't need a bathing suit! I mean, we're here alone, aren't we? Are we? Well, of course we are. Come on, Diane. I am just dying to see the inside of this place. Maybe we could find something to wear. Terrific. Judy? Sure, why not? I think I'll swim in this a little while longer. Come on. Come on, Penny. Wow. Oh, wow. Look at this. One surprise after the other. It's fantastic. The spirits here are evil. Oh, and I hope they're male. This'd be a great place for an orgy. Penny, come on. enough with the evil spirits. We're gonna have a ball here. I really would like to freshen up, just in case I run into a good-looking evil spirit. Oh. Hey, listen, Judy. Why don't you check over on that side, and you can have the upstairs. And Penny and I'll look over here. Come on. Come on, Penny! They're upstairs. They're off-limits to us. They're locked. Kind of weird, isn't it? It certainly is. Hey, Judy, Diane, come on! We find them! You aren't gonna believe this-- separate bedrooms with our names on each door, and a bathing suit for each of us! -Each of us? -Each of us! It's fantastic. It's wild! Come on! Judy, this one's yours, right here on the left. Come on, Penny. Hi. Great opening. Hi. Huh? What? What are you doing here? This is a private party. Let me explain. We were worried about you, and we thought we'd come back, see if you were OK. We're fine. Thank you. Goodbye! Ciao. Um, just one drink. I mean, you know, we did come to see if you were all right. One One. Just one. Friendly little girl. There should be more like that in the world. Um, this is really a big, big place, isn't it? All right. Thank you for the drink. We'll go. Come on, Mark. Drink up. Holy. She looks great. Hi. -Hi. Hi. You're Judy, right? MARK: Hey, come on, Joey! Oh no! [chattering] [singing] You know those words? Mhm. You wanna sing with me? Mm-mm. You're a lot of fun to go out with. I like going out with you. I always feel alone. Where is everybody? This is supposed to be a party. Hey, anybody home? Hey! Anybody home? -Shh! Where's the party? Hey! You've got to be quiet. Why? Because-- Shh. You'll wake up Mark. He's sleeping. Look, if you don't be quiet, Sylvia's gonna call for the cops. -The cops? Yeah. Thought we were having a party. Well, the party's over. Now, look. You take these blankets. Because it's pretty evident that you're too drunk to drive. Too drunk to d-- Shh! You're my only friend, Mark. You're the only friend I have. I'll keep you covered nicely. Too drunk to drive. I don't drink. No! [gasp] I've had enough of this. Now, fun is fun, but this is not funny. Now, you all say you found the same thing in your rooms. But one of you, or two of you, or three of you, or maybe even four of you, knew you were going to find it! Now, damn it, who is it? All right. If that's the way you're going to be, to hell with your reunion. [gasp] You're not leaving. Not yet. Sisters, welcome. Sylvia, Judy, Diane, Francie, Penny, welcome to my home. I'm so you all decided to come. Seven years is a long time. You've all grown lovelier. And I? I've just grown a great deal older. But surely you haven't forgotten my daughter. [gasping] My god, it's Mr. Clybourn. What do you want? One of you, the one who murdered my daughter. Oh no, Mr. Clybourn. No one murdered your daughter. We all loved Elizabeth. That's true, Mr. Clybourn. That's true. You've got to believe that. The truth, Francie, is that she was murdered. Your daughter's death was an accident. The finding with accidental death, a tragic but accidental death! Mr. Clybourn, please. I know how-- how much you loved Elizabeth, how proud you were of her talents. We were all proud just to be her friend. But now you're saying that-- Very moving, Francie. But unfortunately, you're mistaken, or lying! You see, one of you did not love my Elizabeth. One of you hated her so much that you placed a live round on the pillow, and then calmly watched while her head, her beautiful head, was broken into a hundred fragments! [screaming] Penny! Penny, stop it! Penny, no! [screaming] [shouting] Mark, the current! [screaming] Damn it! You touch that fence, and you'll burn up! I'll never get out. Get outta here. We're lost! We'll never get out! Put the [inaudible] in the house! He's a mad man! He's gonna kill us! It's dead, just as you should be for not following my instructions. Hey, who are you? What the hell is going on here? Your instructions were to bring those girls here and leave. Well, listen, mister-- No, you listen! And you tell your friend exactly what I tell you. I could kill you, but I won't. You see, Elizabeth wouldn't like that. You had nothing to do with her murder. I don't know what you're talking about. I don't know anybody named Elizabeth. He's talking about his daughter. He thinks one of us murdered her. Can you prove that Mr. Clybourn? Why, yes, Judy. I have a witness. You have five witnesses. We all saw it happen. You all saw the execution. But one of you saw something else before the initiation began. She saw the murderer change bullets. You're lying. Why didn't your so-called witness tell that to the police seven years ago? Because of guilt. She never dreamed the bullet was real, but she should have. She could have stopped the murderer. If that's true, then tell me who it is. Diane, Sylvia, Francie, Penny, who? Tomorrow, Judy. Tomorrow, everyone will know everything. No, not tomorrow. Tell us now! [gunshot] That is my final warning. She wasn't murdered. She wasn't. It was an accident. What-- what happened? -Where are the others? -They're out by the fence. They're OK. What's going on? That maniac who hired us just took a shot at me. What? Judy! Judy, are you all right? Here, take care of her, will you? Joe. That man's got a gun. He's after the girls. Now, somehow, we have got to find out a way to turn off that fence and get them outta here. Clybourn, he believes it. He really believes it. He said he had a witness. A witness? Only a few places they put fuseboxes. My guess is the cellar. Let's find it. Judy, Sylvia, we just couldn't wait any longer! Everything's all right, Francie. Mark, what about them? Clybourn is talking crazy. Ladies, ladies, ladies. Look, we can get out of here, but you've gotta help. Now, you two go with Joey, and the rest of you come with me. Come on. Come on. Let's go. -OK, look. We're gonna start looking now. -But what are we looking for? -A cellar door. Come on. [gasp] What's the matter? Nothing. I just saw a spider. I'm sorry. You're shaking. I'm all right. Listen, he and I will keep looking. Why don't you go out in the living room? I think Penny's out there, and I don't-- Alone? It's all right. I'll go find her. I'm afraid I'm not much good to you this way. I'm really sorry. Come on. Penny? Penny? [chanting] Oh no. I shut it off. I knew I threw the switch. Are you sure? Of course I'm sure! [scream] Judy, what's-- Oh my god. My god! I tried to find her. I looked everywhere. I swear I thought I could find her. Oh, it's my fault. Come on, Judy, please. What the hell have we gotten ourselves into now? Alphabetically? We got a nut running around with a gun, one dead girl, and four potential victims. Six. Hey, look. This may sound wild, but you don't suppose those guys had anything to do with it, do you? I don't know. Oh, come on, Sylvia, how could they? You were with Mark all the time, weren't you? I guess so. And we were with Joey. So-- All the time? Well, not each and every second, but no, no, Sylvia. It's that madman. Anyway, we'd better drop it now. I've gotta talk to you. In fact, I gotta talk to all of you. Is she all right? Yeah. Now, this morning, when you and I were talking to Clybourn, he mentioned something about a witness. He's crazier than I thought. If he is telling the truth, it means that one of you is working with him. Look, I'm just trying to find out what the hell is going on here. All right, Mark, enough of this. We're sitting here, accusing one another, we should be trying to find a way to get the hell outta here. Yeah, Joey, you're right. It's just that I can't seem to come up with any good escape plans today. Hey, Mark. Hm? We gotta think of something and pretty quick. It's not gonna stay daylight forever. You got any ideas? No, but I know one thing that keeps going through my mind. When it gets dark, that joker up there's gonna be able to get to those girls. Hey, what'd you just say? You heard me. I said, when it gets dark, he's gonna be able to get to those girls one by one. Especially if they're inside and alone. Hey, you're shaking. I'm scared. I know what you mean. I don't know what we would have done without you and Mark. Well, I hate to tell you this, but it's gonna cost you. Take us to the inn tomorrow night for dinner. OK? OK. Do you really think we're gonna get outta this? Sure, we will It'll be simple. Trust me. Try not to be afraid, OK? How long do those girls have to wait in their rooms? Well, come on. How long? Until that joker comes down the stairs. [applause] [knocking on door] Francie, it's Diane. Please, open the door. I can't stay in my room anymore, 'cause I'm afraid! I think it's a stupid plan, anyway. Now, Clybourn may be crazy, but that man is not dumb. You're just saying that to make me feel better. I'm not, Diane. Honest, I'm not. Look, I'll prove it to you. I really would like to take a shower. Now that you're here, I'm going to. Francie, you can't take a shower. Clybourn or no Clybourn, I really feel, you know? So I'm gonna take a shower. And it's going to be a nice, long, hot shower. And besides, those scissors are enough to scare off anybody. I'll see you in a little bit. Francie. I really don't think you should take a shower. Cleanliness is next to godliness, right? So I figure, if I'm next to him, Clybourn won't get next to me. Smart chick. I'm not staying here any longer. I'm gonna go wait in the hall. Joey. [screaming] Sylvia, what's going on? Oh my god! Oh, come on. All right. Calm down. Calm down. Calm down. Sylvia. It-- it's OK, honey. Where are the others? Francie's in the shower. She's OK. MARK: Now, look, you go with Joe and get her. Sylvia and I'll get Judy. We'll meet outside, near the gate. Come on. Hurry! [screaming] Hey, Mark, there must be planes flying over here every day. Why don't we put an SOS sign up on the roof? I thought it was a good idea. Mark, listen. That water gets out of here by going under. MARK: Yeah. JOEY: Now, are you thinking what I'm thinking? It's worth a try. I'll go look for a shovel. You take care of the girls. Don't worry, honey. We'll get outta this. This'll work. What if doesn't? We'll think of something else. OK? I figured out how to make the SOS sign. You did? Mhm. Come on. Oh, you're beautiful. [hissing] Gimme. -Where are we gonna put this? -I know. Come on. When I make a mistake, it's a beaut. I never dreamed it would turn out this way. Penny. Francie. I just never dreamed. I know. I just keep wondering which one of us is next. Where's Joe and Diane? Up at the house. Diane had some idea about making an SOS sign. Let's get started. I'm gonna need your help. Susie! You OK? My ankle, think. You're gonna be all right? You're Sure? Look, stay here and rest. I'll be right back. Ow! You know how long it's been since I've done an honest day's work? Hey, don't worry. We're gonna get outta here. What's the difference? It'll never be the same-- my career, my future, everything. Get some rocks to hold this down. That's why it didn't work. Diane, come here. What is it? It's a power source. That fusebox had nothing to do with it. The fence is run by this thing. Go get Mark. Well, there goes another brilliant idea shot to hell. That damn thing could go down 10 feet. And where the hell did she go? Sylvia! Oh my god! Sylvia! Hey, Judy! Judy, wait a minute! Mark! Mark, Joe needs you. Is Sylvia with you? No, come on. He found the power source. He needs you over there! Look, you go get Judy. Tell her we'll find Sylvia. Then both of you come back here and wait for us. OK. [barking] Joey, Joey! Joey, look out! Joey! Judy, Sylvia, Joe found the power source! Judy, Sylvia, come on. We can get out. Joe found the power source. Judy? Sylvia, are you there? We can get out. Judy, answer me. Clybourn, you bastard! I'm gonna kill you! [screaming] Let me out! Help me! No! [hissing] [screaming] It's time, Judy. [gunshot] Get out! Get out! Sister Judy, the pledge is ready. It's been quite a reunion, hasn't it, sister? Sylvia. Yes, Judy. I'm the one. Oh, Mr. Clybourn, she's scared. Welcome to our reunion. Come in, Mark. You'll enjoy watching this. Where's Clybourn? Mark! Drop it. Over there. Move! Mark! He can't help you, Judy. No one can. You see, we set a trap, and you fell for it. I didn't see anyone change the bullets, Judy. We made that story up. We were only going to terrorize the Sisters until the right one confessed. Things didn't quite work out that way, Judy. The right one, the right one, the guilty one started killing the others off. You know who the guilty is, don't you, Judy? No. I didn't kill anyone. You murdered my Elizabeth. Sylvia, what's the matter with you? It's him. Can't you see that? He's insane. Yes. Yes, I might be. You killed my daughter. I wanted to die, but I had to go on living for seven years. Sweet little Judy. You're a killer! You'd kill anyone to get what you want. And right now, you want to marry the Governor's son. Don't you? What did you want so badly you killed my daughter? Mr. Clybourn, I told you, Elizabeth was beautiful, and talented. Judy wanted to be number one. She couldn't while Elizabeth was alive. Mr. Clybourn, please, she's lying. She's just saying all those things because she knows. She knows that she's more responsible than any of us for Liz's death. She's the one who pulled that trigger. Did you tell him that you pulled the trigger? Yes, I pulled the trigger! I pulled the trigger, and my life was over! Do you know what my life has become since that night? I've become a drunk and a whore. I was ready to commit suicide. Mr. Clybourn convinced me my Sister set me up. You wanted Liz murdered, and you set me up to do your killing! Sylvia, I was a pledge. Oh yes, you were a pledge. And you were nervous. Oh, you wanted to know everything-- where you would kneel, how the bullets would be placed in the pillow, everything! And like a fool, I told you! Yes, it's true. I did wanna know everything, but not because I was nervous. Because you wanted to murder Liz! No, Sylvia. I had to know everything because Liz asked me to. Mr. Clybourn, please. I never dreamed she was planning suicide. SYLVIA: You're lying. No. That's a secret I've had to carry for seven years. Suicide? Why? Because of you. Mr. Clybourn, music was your world, not Liz's. But she just couldn't refuse you. No. It's not true. Not true! It is true! Now, can we please stop this insanity? Yes, I'll stop it, right now! [screaming] We're going to relive the initiation, Judy. Why, I'll tell you everything that's going to happen. That's a Gatling gun, Judy. Mr. Clybourn made all the bullets. Some are real, and others are not. Does that bring back memories? Mr. Clybourn, turn the crank. Aw. That one wasn't real. You were lucky, Judy, just like seven years ago. Stop it, please! Let's try it again, Mr. Clybourn. [gunshots] No. Mark, help! Help, Mark! Stop it, stop it! Stop it! [gunshots] No! Come on! Come on! [gunshots] Come on. Let's go. We made it. Mark? I made it. [gunshot]
