Unfortunately he doesn't paint. So far, many projects of the artist have focused on a specific approach to the topic of death, fantasising about it. Here, for example, is a project... "The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil." The artist gnawed all the apples on the apple tree at night. It was a strong reference to the myth of the Original Sin. Anda Rottenberg defines his work as existential post-essentialism. Attention! I'll count to three. One Two Three Four Five Six Seven Now he's suffering from severe depression. I think this is the last moment to help him. Ready? Yes. Listen, I think... Zbyszek, what exactly is the meaning of your activity? You gave the hardest one at the beginning. The meaning of my activity... It's the meaning... just the same as the meaning of life. But with the difference that it's seemingly detached from life. In a way I am ironic about life... Do you think it's moral what you do? Well, for sure. There's no question about it. I've never done anything with the intention of provoking people. I mean one can take such action to cause a violent reaction. - Do you have more of these? - It is simply a well-known trick. - Leave it. - In the era of happenings they had... - You owe me for the rent for the last six months. - ...Quite violent actions, especially the Germans. These were actions simply calculated to shock, dazzle... Oskar, it's very simple. The artist produces a work of art, his patron values, promotes and sells them. You're the only artist in my gallery, who's not capable of understanding that. If this does not change, we'll have to part ways. I just cannot afford that... You're on fire... You're on fire! You're on fire! Can't you see it? You're on fire! Kocham ci! Remember Warpechowski's performance in a coffin on wheels? - I do... - Pulling a string and fucking driving around. We were little shits then... And then he suddenly stopped. The coffin stopped and I was fucking certain he was dead. You screwed up his whole performance. I just... fucking... ran up to the coffin, opened it, and guess what he said? "Fuck off!" Can I help you pass? Why are you still investing in him? There's no point... Oskar, how am I supposed to sell a performance? I have no cash. We're stony broke. You know how in the Middle Ages they punished people for revealing secrets? No, I don't know. They poured molten silver into the throat. The silver got cold and hard very quickly. And thus a beautiful sculpture was created. "Speech is Silver..." Hello. - Help! - O. D. We have to sell it. Trash. Trash. Fuck! - You're trash yourself. - Archtrash. If it's no longer about anything, then at least we have to get something from that. From what? You think it's so easy and that... that if you wanted to, you could end up like me. But you are simply wrong. Ta dah! Apparently nothing's changed, and yet... It's all crap! Then perhaps reduce the gallery by 10 per cent... What do you mean? Well, like there's an institution with a reduced gallery and nothing changes in it. But it's already been done. - Soft institutional critique. - Well... so what's your great idea then? Let's open the form. What do you mean? Abandon the form at all? No, why? No. Let's simply open it. You can dine here in exchange for drawings. Your patron's idea, she cares about you. - Narrow the door to the gallery. - Again, it's institutional critique. That's right. But there's an idea in it. A form converted into an idea. Pure idea. Already done! Maybe something more conceptual then? Conceptual? Nah... Maybe we could try correcting the masters? There's Malevich's Square, painted crookedly, and we could straighten it up. To make it even. It is indeed crooked... why not... Straightening the square sounds OK, as usually one straightens crooked things, yeah... straightening the square... Already done! Listen! The Holocaust! - No, not the Holocaust! - But it's the only thing that works. Yes or no? Does the Holocaust work? But so much stuff's been made about the Holocaust... But this is the only situation where a Polish artist can present himself abroad. - But there's too many such... - Holocaust, amber, straw. Already done! To get these things somehow together... Straw has got a strong position - especially in the theatre. OK... how about a bird on a clear easel, wrapped in wire. Well... that's the true Holocaust. - That's what I'm saying - the Holocaust. - But I'm saying it's already been done. Already done! - Done? - That's right. - Many times, but I'm talking about absence, withdrawal... - Guys... Let's just do nothing. 'Cause then you'll have the beginning and the end... nothingness. Well... you could do nothingness. Why not... Then it's pure form. And idea. And this is my proposal for today. Unfortunately he doesn't paint.

The artist gnawed all the apples on the apple tree in the night It was a sort of strong reference to the myth of the Original Sin. Anda Rottenberg defines his work as existential post-essentialism. In general, the artist many times through his work committed suicide. Now he's suffering from severe depression. I think this is the last moment to help him. I simply belong to society. And no matter how much I bend over backwards, willing to be cut off from society, the mere fact of bending over backwards means that I'm forming some relation to society. Not only that - society is somehow bringing me up as well, i.e. I cannot be just a total freak, someone completely freakish, so society wouldn't even understand me. Of course I am not talking about society's wide approval, but society causes some people to be one way, and others to be another way. This is a date-rape drug. And this is Viagra. And now follow me please. Ta dah! WINDOW OF LIFE I should colour in all those blackouts. Can you imagine? Standing for five hours talking to people... And then nothing... And you remember absolutely nothing... A total blank. Yesterday, your master, Warpechowski had a heart attack. It seems that he's near the end. I am the master. I'm the best master and the greatest master. And the master smokes only Marlboro. The best Polish cigarettes. Everybody smokes Marlboro! The master smokes only Marlboro. Go ahead... try Marlboro. The best cigarettes - Marlboro. The master smokes only Marlboro. Unfortunately he doesn't paint.

I am interested in buying the sculpture that you intend to make. "Speech is Silver". As I understand a human corpse will be needed, right? Yes. It's possible. I need an advance payment. Do you think he is gong to kill himself? Prices will go up, right? Oskar! The film has featured the following works of art:
