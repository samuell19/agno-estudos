Edo Period: Enter Idx/sub provided by baragon63@ADC Constabulary! Down! Sensei! Takase-kun?! Take those tails off! They're not against the rules! See me after school! No, thank you! Kawabe Mikako, Year 3B Room Teacher At the end of the Edo Period Kawabe Mikako, Year 3B Room Teacher Kawabe Mikako, Year 3B Room Teacher Japan came close to civil war. Japan came close to civil war. The new government wanted to seize the Shogun': castle in Edo. Numata Shintaro Numata Shintaro The hero who saved the city was... Katsu Kaishu. He convinced Saigo Takamori... Morina Eri Morina Eri not to attack. Morina Eri Marina Eri Edo, modern Tokyo, was saved from destruction. Edo, modem Tokyo, was saved from destruction. Takase Masa ya Go sleep in the nurse's office. Sit down! Sit back down! If Katsu and Saigo hadn't reached an agreement... Japan might be a completely different place. The Western powers might have colonized... I'm not finished! See you, Eri. She's a pain in the butt! She doesn't care about us, but she still hits me! She's no help with college, either. Have you decided? - No. - Let me know. Why? We won't all be going to the same university. Shintaro': smarter than us. Wait I'll get started. Shintaro, what university are you applying to? Leave me alone. Jerk! So you want to be a vet... A vet? Yes. No, my son wants to be a doctor. A vet. You want to be a doctor! Yes. For animals. Don't be silly! Just go into medicine, all right? Leave me alone! Shintaro! Shintaro! Why not talk at home? There's no point. She thinks you're nothing if you're not a doctor. Numata, your marks are good enough for Medicine. If your parents can afford it, that's what you should study. You're on their side? It's for your sake. Socially speaking, doctors are much more respected. You may not understand that yet. But still... I'm not finished yet! Mid-term History Exam What was that?! What was it? I forget! Experience History! Leave him! Don't shove! Be careful! Are you OK? Sorry- What's wrong? He ignored us! 'Cause you were on my case. Just leave us alone. No! I'm your home-room teacher, after all. Apologize! Hey! Takase? Takase! What's this light? History TIME TRIP APP March 10th, 1868 March 10111, 1868 Come along! Come along! Stand aside! This could mean the end of Edo! Get your copy now! There You go! Don't push! There's enough for all of you! This coming March 15th, the army of the new government... led by the Satsuma and Choshu clans, will attack Edo! This means trouble! Get your copy now! They'll burn Edo! Fool! You think we'll let them do that?! Edo Castle Lord Katsu... the Satsuma and Choshu clan armies are marching on Edo. 'Satcho' will attack March 15th. The Shogun has surrendered his commission to the Emperor... but still their new government wants to take Edo by force. We must not simply surrender the Shogun': castle to them! Hear, hear! Katmai, Kaishu Commander We have deployed in the city. Yanagida Ryuzo 2nd-in-Command We will equip ourselves with new French weapons. We will equip ourselves with new French weapons. No! I am against war. They will attack in five days, and you still say not to fight? Yes. I have written to their leader, Saigo Takamori... proposing peace negotiations. Has he answered? No. But I expect a message soon. Let's say he agrees to negotiate. He will demand that the Shogun withdraw from governing. That will mean the end of his Tokugawa clan. And still you say we shouldn't fight? Yes. Whose man are you?! Traitor! Lord Katsu! Saigo Takamori Katsu is determined to negotiate with Saigo. That won't do any good, but just in case... you know what to do. Merikens? Perhaps Satcho agents here to stir up trouble. We're interrogating them. What are you plotting, dressed in those strange clothes? The truth! I told you! We're not here to stir up trouble! We haven't done anything! You speak fluent Japanese. Who sent you here? Speak! No one! Satsuma? No! Choshu? No! Don't play innocent with me! Nope. What, sir? They're not Merikens. We'd better tell them. Tell them what? Speak up! I'll tell you the truth. Speak. We came here... in a time warp! That is a code for what? I plead the 5th! Me, too! 'The 5th '? Yes. Torture them both! Hey: Wait! Somebody? Anybody? Help! He'll us! - Do you know this woman, Sir? - No. Katsu Kaishu, right? How do you know? You're famous! Me? The castle! You surrendered it! You're huge! You're a great man, I mean. Progressive, ground-breaking. A true manly hero! Oh, please! I'm honored to meet you! So please help! Magistrate! As Military Commander, I will take charge of them. As Military Commander... do you not have better things to do than consort with the likes of these? Well, yeah... Soba Noodles Thanks. So how was it over there? 'Over there'? Yeah, over there. They must have progressed. I can see that. Just by looking at us? I figured you out right from the start. Wow! That shows how progressive you are! How's politics? Awful. The recession goes on and on. Yeah, they've got a lot to do. Even Johnson. Johnson? The Meriken president. 'Meriken'? 'America'. I know you left Japan to study. You violated the ban and sneaked out. I won't turn you in, so don't worry. We'll talk more when things calm down. He doesn't understand. Hello! This will mean civil war! What happens to Edo? Lord Katsu! Is the Satcho army really heading for Edo? Will there be war? War?! Your army will protect us, won't it? We'll be all right, won't we? He's ignoring them! Sure we will! Lord Katsu': in command. Out! People eat here! Don't disturb a customer. Get out! Thanks. This is good! Meriken! It's been years! Excuse me. I'm his wife Tami. Kawabe Mikako. Takase Masaya. They'll stay here. Good. We need servants. Especially maids. They aren't servants. I took them from the Magistrate. They're criminals? Not really. But looking like that, they might get arrested again. Get them some clothes. All right. What happens now? Will we ever get back? It's going to be war! No, it isn't. He opens the castle. I've heard of that. Katsu Kaishu negotiated with Saigo Takamori. There was no battle in Edo. OK, but what are we doing here? Ow ow ow! What's that for?! This isn't a dream, then. No! I've been here three days! Three days? Yes. I came yesterday. We time-warped into different days? Morino and Numata might be here, too. This might be my fault. Nothing happened during the test. You were cheating! So what? So plenty! Anyway, suddenly the display started flashing. Takase! What's this light? Where's that phone? I lost it. You lost it?! I gave your letter to Saigo Takamori. Thank you, Kanda. What did he say? Nothing. I see... You can see right across Edo to the sea from here. This is where I ended up. Me, too. This is Eri's! She's here! So Numata must be, too. What's this? Hey! That's mine! From Meriken? We're not from Meriken! Anglond? France? We're from the future! 'The future'? Never heard of it. Where's that? It's 1868 now, right? So you know Western years! We are... from the future, in 2014. We've traveled through time... into the past... and ended up here! Don't make fun of me, please. I don't have time for bad jokes. It's not a joke! It's the real deal. 'Real deal'? It means it's true. What's this? Don't do anything else! It says we can go back in four days! It does! You're crazy. What did you do?! A horseless carriage! It's called a 'car'. Hey! Don't! Careful! What was that?! Was Katsu Kaishu really such a brave hero? So they say. 'They saw'? I'm not so sure any more. Do you believe us now? I guess there are things in this world I don't know about. It looks like we can go back in four days, on March 14th. I have two more students to find. Who are you? What the...?! Run! Did you see him? His twin! That was nothing. Nothing. I was scared stiff. That was a warning. You were scared, too. Sir! But who were they? Satsuma? I doubt it. So they're ours... Yeah. 'Ours? There are many who think he's in the way. You mean they're relatives? Shogun': men. Yanagida': men. Who's Yanagida? A Shogun': retainer who hates Katsu. I don't know the name. Why would they be after you? You're a Shogun': man. He's against fighting Satcho. A samurai must not lose without putting up a fight. That's right. It's stupid pride. People are talking about you. You lack samurai pride, they say. It's time we ended the age of the samurai. And they say you're no swordsman, and you don't even have a license. Let them talk. And that you're on Satcho': side. Yeah. Let them talk. And that you have 'outside children'. And that you lay hands on the maids. I'm a samurai. We do that. That's not fair! Now suddenly you're a samurai? This doesn't concern you! Keep your voice down, please. Have we heard from Saigo? No. Don't worry. There's no fighting in Edo. No? Because... Because why? History says you met Saigo... at the Satsuma clan': Edo residence and negotiated... Wait... today's March 10th, right? Yes. Saigo': supposed to have agreed to meet you. What do you mean? Yamaoka Tesshu gave Saigo your letter, and he's brought back a reply. Wait a minute. I didn't give Yamaoka my letter, and I haven't had an answer. What's going on? I don't know this Yanagida, and this isn't the history we learn. I guess your history's wrong. Is that possible? Just maybe someone else from the future is influencing things. So history's changing? Yes. So if Mr. Katsu and Saigo don't meet and there's war in Edo... then what happens? What happens? Edo ends up as a sea of fire. We've got to find Eri and go back! But then, the future's changed, too. So our present': changed? It might not be there?! Do we vanish? Do we die?! Sensei! I wouldn't know! What do we do?! Do? All we can do is trust Mr. Katsu! Me? Yes! Whether our future stays the same depends on you! Hey, wait a minute... Are you really Katsu Kaishu?! Well, yeah... He's not like that! I'm him! Then be him! I'm trying hard! How? I'm waiting... hard. For Saigo': answer. That's doing nothing! I have a letter that Lord Katsu asked me to give to Saigo. You're certain this is a good idea? For the Shogun... we have no choice but to fight. Tokaido Highway Checkpoint Charge! Retreat! Sir! Who's he looking for? I don't know. Lord Katsu said look after him. Eri? Eri? Eri? 'Eri!' 'Eri!' No, that's not what I said. That's not it. More flip to the eyelashes. 'Flip'? Yeah, 'flip'. Kind of curvy, with a 'flip'. A flip? Yes. 'Flip'! How's that? See? Cute, huh? Six months before Who are you?! Yeah?! The real deal?! 'Real deal'? You believe I'm from the future? You are not one who would lie, Miss Eri. I know I can count on you! May I ask you something? Anything you like. In your time, do the Tokugawas still remain? Tokugawa'? Oh, I've heard that name. I know a Mr. Tokugawa. The 25th? I don't know that many. But there is a Mr. Tokugawa. Indeed? The Tokugawa: continue! why do You ask? I want the era of the Tokugawas to continue. That must mean we suppress the Satcho forces now. I am relieved to hear the Tokugawas are secure. Don't worry, 'Yana'. Hang in there. Yana! Milord! What is it? The new guns have arrived from France. And Satcho? I am sure Saigo knows we have French support... and that we are ready to resist. The time draws near. Wanted Yes, sir. MED! Let us know if you see these two. Tell the other departments, too. Shinmon Tatsugoto Volunteer Fire Department Chief Thanks. Shinmon Tatsugoto Volunteer Fire Department Chief Shinmon Tatsugoto Volunteer Fire Department Chief No problem! Anything for you. No problem! Anything for you. Let's go! Get going- YES, sir! Will this really help? We'll try anything we can. What's wrong?! Nothing. You're scared of dogs? No! Yes, you are! You got bitten as a boy. You knew that? It's famous. How much do you know? You almost died. Where'd he get bitten? Right in the...? Come on. Now, that would hurt! Lord Saigo! The Tokugawa army is deployed to fight. As planned... ...on March 15th we attack Edo! March 11 d! Days to attack: Days to attack: 4 Tokugawa Yoshinobu 15th Tokugawa Shogun Tokugawa Yoshinobu 15th Tokugawa Shogun How long do we wait? Yesterday Satcho broke through the Tokaido Highway Checkpoint! Have patience. Your Highness... Thinking of the future of Tokugawa... we have no choice but to fight. No, Your Highness. We must avoid war at all costs. Do you wish to sully your legacy by bringing an end... to 260 years of Tokugawa rule? We have arranged to import the latest French weapons... through the port at Yokosuka. I request your approval. The Western powers will conquer us! It is best for Japan... that Tokugawa rule continue. The import of weapons is approved. Sire! Silence! Thank you, Your Highness. You have us wait, and wait, and you do nothing! Tami! Pull out! Mr. Katsu! Just now a bunch of thugs came in and wrecked the place! They just left. You can still catch them! They just left. You can still catch them! Mr. Katsu! Aren't you going after them? Let them go. Do you know who they were? You know... there are many who think I'm in the way. That's why you should be going after them! Have a drink. Not hungry? I'll have it, then. How can you eat? Why a"! You mad? What's wrong with you? After what your family went through... Why don't you do something? People eat here. Don't disturb a customer. Don't be funny! Sensei! The Katsu Kaishu I know... is a great man, progressive, ground-breaking... a true, manly hero! He changed Japan, and brought about a great peace. But you're completely different. A coward who does nothing. I'm disappointed. Hey": Tami? Why don't you talk to Mr. Katsu? He wouldn't listen. You could have been killed! There's no point. Once he's decided on something, he sees it through. Sees it through? This happened because he hasn't done anything. Hello? May I speak to someone? Tami! Here I am! Who would you be? I'm from the Firefighters. I did it! This isn't the time! Hey! Um... From Saigo? No. They've found someone who resembles the sketch. Here. It's this way. There. What are you doing? How did you find me? It's you, isn't it. Why did you do that yesterday? Because Katsu Kaishu is a coward who won't fight. He's like a different person. How long have you been here? We've been here four days, and two. A year. Really?! Anyway, it's going to be all right. We can all go back the day after tomorrow. If the future hasn't changed. I'm not going back. Why not? I don't want to. What's so good about now? Don't come back here. Wait a minute! You have to go back! Why? You have to live in your own time. Leave me alone. I can't. You're my student. What? I don't think of you as my teacher. What does that mean? You don't do anything. Don't come back. Your family will be wonted! I have a family here. A baby? Chiyo. She doesn't know about me. Don't come back here, please. What about you? Do you think the same? You do. Your intentions might be good. I'm thinking a lot about what university to go to... and what to study, and what I'm cut out for. But you just look at our T-scores and say do this or do that. You don' think with us. That means, from the way we see it... you aren't doing anything. This cannon can fire different types of shell. These are the new cannons. Yes, French guns are much, much better than ours. We're almost in Edo. So it's raining there? March 12th Have you seen this girl? March 12th Days to attack: Days to attack: 3 This girl's name is Eri... The Satsuma Store' What's Satsuma going to do here?! Get out of town! What's going on?! Lord Katsu! He's from Satsuma! He's lived here with us in Edo for years. Come on. Thank you. Get out of Edo! Bear with us. Please. I want no more of this. So the rumors about you are true... There are a lot of rumors about me. Which one? That you're really on Satsuma': side. That you've joined with Satcho to overthrow the Shogun. That you don't care about Edo! That you're a traitor! Traitor! Come on. That coward! I'm sorry about that. Thank you. No matter what anyone says to you, don't be drawn. You're hurt. It's nothing. - An umbrella? - No. I'm fine. Could I talk to you? This gets harder and harder. Um... Have a drink. Thank you. I've failed as a teacher. My students told me that. But I knew it, anyway. I've been going through the motions... but I have no idea what I really should be doing. I lack the confidence to advise them what to do... when they graduate. And so... if they've got a good T-score just tell them... to find a good university. Then at least I feel a bit better. You don't understand, do you. At the end of the day... I'm just pretending. I don't do anything for them. But while you look like you aren't doing anything... you're trying to carry through what you think is right. I guess in the future a lot of things have progressed. Like cars. Yes, and there's lots more. 'Airplanes' that can fly you to Meriken in one day. Or you can 'telephone' there without even leaving... But one thing hasn't advanced. People. In the future... I've never met anyone... who wants to carry through what he thinks is right... no matter what people say, or how much he's misunderstood. I'm not as great as you think. Am I really right? It may take years for that question to be answered. I just don't know. Is your foot asleep? Just for a minute there. But I'm fine now. You stood up too fast. It scared me. But I just noticed. It's like a planetarium. A plana-what? We don't see stars like this in the future. The air': dirty, and there's too many lights. Tell me... is the future bright? Yes. The future is bright. March 13th Days to attack: Days to attack: 2 Satsuma Clan Edo Residence First time here? Yes. It's a fine city. Yes. Take a good look at it. The Satcho army is here. They attack 'm two days. We're ready for them. Wait a little longer. I don't think Saigo will answer your letter. I'm sure you know what that means. He intends to attack Edo the day after tomorrow. Stop being stubborn. You do not have a single ally among the Tokugawa retainers. We are reinforcing positions at Itabashi and Shinjuku. Make it the real deal. Have all our soldiers ready for action. 'Real deal'? The real deal?! Your friend might be with a man named Yanagida. There. That way. Thanks! Would this be the house of Mr. Yanagida? Who are you? Takase Masaya. Who sent you?! I'm staying with Mr. Katsu... Katsu? Go away! What was it you wanted to talk about? We can't let the Satcho army lay even a finger on Edo. So I need a favor. If the Satcho army attacks... I want you to set the city on fire. Lord Katsu! I fight fires. I risk my life to save Edo from fire. While I don't want anyone to lay a finger on the city... You are risking your life to preserve Edo. That's what you want? All right! If and when Satcho attacks, we will burn Edo! And... if Edo burns, arrange for boats on the Sumida River... so people can escape. What are you doing?! I have to find Eri! That bell only sounds when there's a fire! I'm going to save Eri and take her back with me! And I'm the watchman. I'm begging you! Please! I know where there's fire! And here... Cute, huh? It's beautiful! Ta-da! Is this what you call 'cute'? It sure is! Look! That fool started a fire! Move! That's really cute! It's beautiful! And this... Fire! Near here! Quick! Hey! Wait a minute! Miss Eri! Er]! Masaya! Are you OK?! I thought I'd never seen you again! No way for that! I missed you! Don't worry. We'll never be parted again. Masaya! I love you. I missed you! Ever since kindergarten! Masaya! It doesn't seem to have been a big fire. No? But the volunteer fire departments are acting strangely. What do you mean? Saigo Takamori... Saigo Takamori?! You're Saigo Takamori, right? You're jealous! I am not! You were lonely! I was not! But Yana's not a bad man. He tries hard, and he says I changed his life. He's just a dirty old man. It's your fault history's changed. It is?! It was supposed to... Mr. Katsu! Mr. Katsu! Sensei! Morino! Thank goodness! You're OK?! Yes. What's all the fuss? Sorry- I met Saigo Takamori! Are you sure? Yes! By the soba place! The soba place? He says he never got your letter. Which soba place? Mr. Katsu! Thank goodness! Welcome. Lord Katsu... Lord Saigo... I wasn't expecting to see you here. Nor was I. Are you alone? Yes. I came in to sneak a bite. And ran into the last man you wanted to see? Two, please. When we first met, four years ago... you talked about this place. I doubted that anywhere could be as good as you said it was. And what do you think now? It was worth coming to. Good. Because it might not be here much longer. No. I'm glad to hear you remembered it after four years. I remember everything we talked about. So do I. Here you are. Thanks. I'll be going. Thanks. Thank you. You're still eating?! You didn't talk about anything important! If you don't negotiate, the future changes! We talked. Eight years ago, I sailed over to Meriken. When we reached San Francisco, my first surprise was a welcome kiss. Right on the cheek. Then they looked at our topknots, and asked what was on our heads. The harbor was much more advanced than in Japan. The trains, the mint, and the printers were all a surprise. But that kind of progress I was expecting. What really surprised me... was that the people chose their own president. Here the ones with high positions pass them on to their children. So we get a lot of idiots. In Meriken, the people at the top consider the ones at the bottom. When I came back from Meriken, I saw things differently. I realized... that I was a Japanese before I was a Tokugawa retainer. And because of that, Japanese must never fight each other. So if Japan will benefit, I don't care if people say... I lack samurai pride or I'm a traitor, or a coward. The times are changing. At this rate, Japan will be left behind. The day of the sword is gone. I said that to Saigo four years ago. He agreed with me. Do you trust him... Excuse me! Mi am... I'm sorry to keep you waiting. I am Tami, Katsu's wife. A message from Lord Saigo. He will expect you tomorrow at the Satsuma residence. What? It would seem that Saigo has sent a messenger to Katsu. What were you doing?! I'm very sorr-y! However, things have been taken care of. It's a shame to kill such a man... but it can't be helped. Hear me. This is what Lord Katsu wants. Excuse me... Yes? A visitor. What's wrong? I'm sorry. I was rude to you. Tomorrow I'd like to return to the future. But what about that woman? She's going to have a baby. I've explained everything. She understands. I apologize for the attack on you. I'm sorry. He had to do that if he was going to live in this time. I have a favor to ask, Mr. Katsu. Could Numata... Tami! Yes? Tami! Coming! Yes? If he needs a bed, ask Tami. Thank you! So... What's it like? What? Killing someone. Never did it. So what about... What? You know! She's pregnant, right? That means... Come on! I'm not as green as you think. Hey": if Mr. Katsu can't stop the war and history changes... and we can't get back... how do you think we disappear? I don't know. If we all vanish, I want to be with you and Eri. We're counting on you. Do it, then. Relax. I won't draw. What are you doing?! Stay back! Why?! You look stupid! I have a mission! To kill someone? You'll change history! I am going to live here. Mr. Katsu! Sensei! Wait! Shintaro! Sensei! Sensei, your arm. I'm fine. Numata! March 14th Days to attack: Days to attack: 1 Your target is Katsu! Have a safe trip back to the future. You stay safe, too. Whether we get back or not. Is your arm all right? I'll be back. Wait! Yes? I'm going. I Promise! We've all learned so much from coming back to this time. When I get home, I'm going to start over. I'll be... the kind of teacher my students need. A teacher's job is to build the future. I promise... I will preserve your future. I'm glad we met. So am I. I'll get Numata. Wait by the car. Do you know the time? Yes! You've grown up a bit. Somebody had to be the adult. Hello?! Yes? Is Shintaro here? And you are? Kawabe is my name. Did you know him from before? Yes. He's not here any more. He said he was leaving Edo for somewhere quiet... and he couldn't take me. You're his wife, aren't you? No. My husband died. This is his child. I don't understand... Shintaro happened to be there... when my husband was wounded in a fight. Shintaro brought him home. My husband died... and Shintaro stayed on with me. Have you any idea where he was going? No. OK? Wait! Numata! Numata! What do I do?! You know what to do? All right. Let's go! Hurry! Don't push! Settle down! Get back! Numata... Why are you here? To get you of course! Just leave me alone. We'll have another meeting. You want to be a vet... don't you? We're going home. Let go! I betrayed you! I cut your arm! Don't be stupid! For Tokugawa. We're Japanese. Why won't you idiots understand that?! You idiot! Let me pass. You still don't understand? All of you! Wake up! You idiot! Quick! Don't! It's OK! Careful! Sorry- We've only got two minutes! Oh! no! Are you OK? There's Katsu! Mr. Katsu! Swing it right! Sensei... I will preserve your future. Come on. Masaya! It's time! But... There! Sensei... Sensei! Shintaro! Sensei! Shintaro! Masaya! Great! How long? Where's your phone? Back in the car! “WW, Sense“.! Quick! Hurry! The Age of Tokugawa will go on. Lord Katsu! You dare attack them?! Prepare to fire! Fire! No! No! What's wrong?! Don't shoot! Damn! Edo is our city. The townspeople protected Lord Katsu. We couldn't touch him. Katsu made Edo his ally? Tomorrow's attack... is canceled. If we had attacked Edo... would you really have burned it? I'm an Edo man, born and bred. Sure I'd have burned it. And made it a love-suicide. What's that? You match the colors. The colors? It's pretty hard. But we kissed! You did? You heard me? I thought I loved you then. And now? No way! But that was my first kiss! My first kiss! The 'suspension bridge' effect. She mistook the excitement of Edo for feelings about you. It's not your fault. I knew I could count on you! I knew I could count on you! Aw, shuddup! Aw, shuddup! Western culture and popular feeling... combined to bring reforms in politics, economics and society. This 'Meiji Era' was the time of 'Civilization and Enlightenment'. You may think you have no connection with the history of 140 years ago... but you are wrong. It is all joined to the present. What happened then, and what people thought then...
