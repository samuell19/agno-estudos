DAINICHI EIHAI CO., LTD. DAIEI MOTION PICTURE CO., LTD. During the latter part of the 20th century, mankind succeeds in taking space trips. Japan also has built a space base on the moon and has begun space development. What country's spaceship is this? It is a vast universe. Perhaps others beside people are taking space trips and have development plans. This story is a warning to mankind.

We live here too. Your wife's in a hospital? A new baby in a week or so. Hope it's a boy? Yes. I'm sorry to trouble your sister. Not at all. She's glad to learn English. I guess she's not much help. My girls are tomboys. Helen, wake up. Be late for kindergarten. Ken will laugh at you. I give up! Stop watching TV and brush your teeth! Do it right! Even the dolphin does it better! These dolphins were brought here from Canada by air. Jumbo's the male, Chappy's the female. You'll be late for kindergarten. Rinse your mouth! The dolphin does it too! Any decayed teeth? Take a look. So many bad teeth. The dolphin will laugh at you. Margie! Helen! Forgot something! Wait! You didn't kiss Mommy goodbye. Even dolphins kiss. Now, a kiss for the trainer. Yes, and goodbye to the audience. That's all for now. The first show's at 10 o'clock. Good morning. How are things? So-so. Animals are smarter than us. Yes. What? Mind your teacher and do your games. If you don't... Stop. I know what you mean. Watch and learn from the seals. That's right. Now, for some exercises. Noro's on his head. Moco and Sabu's hand stand. Very good. They're asking for applause. Next, a basketball game. Which side will win? Noro has the ball. Will he succeed? He shoots the ball! This is Moco, the only lady. She did it. Next, a swimming meet. They've started. Noro's dash. He's fast. Nick's second. Noro's first. He's climbing the stand. Nick and Moco too! Do you have to dissect him? Yes, to find a way to keep others healthy. It's our responsibility. Like your child, so we know how you feel. Begin here. Sister! Have you seen Helen? She hasn't returned. She was playing with Ken a while ago. I wonder where they went. Disappearing like magic! Yes. These waters will become polluted too? Fish and shellfish can't live here then. Mankind's fault. Progress in science destroys nature. We must protect animal life from pollution. Of course. Special news! There was a great earthquake in Arabia. 30,000 died, and hundreds of thousands were injured. Magnitude 12. As strong as the one in Peru yesterday. The strongest recorded on earth to date. I repeat... So many. I can't believe it. Magnitude 12.. On opposite sides of the earth. Can't believe it. No. Time for a break. My wife packed fresh fruit juice. Kiyoko made hamburger sandwiches. Kiyoko's the limit! Your wife forgot too? No, I saw her fill it. So did I. I ate too much! Have you any medicine? I want a Coke! Don't go out without permission! Or else it's a spanking when we get home! Father! What's that? Don't change the subject! No, that! A meteor? An artificial satellite circling the earth may have fallen. An unidentified object! Sighted 30km southeast of Kamogawa City! Dove into the sea! At latitude 34째 40째 north and longitude 140째 20째 east. What is it? It's deep there, with dolphins and seals. What if something happens to them? Shall we go? Okay, but the kids? I'm a marine life researcher's son. I'll go too. Groovy! It's Gamera! Gamera! Goody! I don't like monsters. He's our friend! Is he? Gamera! See? He answered! You're so stupid. A 4th dimension ray with instant transfer power. Where are we? Inside a spaceship. Yes, and she's a spacewoman? You watch TV too much. They have grasped the facts correctly. Welcome to Zigra Star spaceship. Zigra Star spaceship? Ridiculous! Never heard of it? Look. This is our Celestial Body Number 105. The distance between your planet and ours: 480 light-years. 480 light-years? That's 2,880 trillion miles! How'd you get here? Unbelievable! There are higher forms of scientific culture than yours. Even so! Then how was a boat on the sea brought here? Helen, I know now. She's a spacewoman! Yes. I knew it right away. The minds of innocent children grasp things faster? I can't believe it yet! Your purpose in wanting us? To represent mankind. Be witnesses of Zigra's high scientific culture. We'll believe you. Prove you're from Zigra and your scientific skill. That's more like it. I'll show you. To the people of the earth... I am from Zigra Planet, Celestial Body Number 105. I'll cause an earthquake you never thought possible. Magnitude 13. This is the third quake after Peru and Arabia. My purpose is to show the people on earth our scientific powers. I will now cause an earthquake in the Tokyo area. You're out of your mind! Watch the facts and see if I am or not. Now, for an earthquake of magnitude 13. What's magnitude, Father? The strength of a quake. A seismometer, 100km from the epicenter... measures the amplitude by micron. The figures recorded is called magnitude. Yes. The Great Kanto earthquake.. It was only magnitude T.9. Even the earthquake om Sanriku was only M8.5. Then... Stop it! If you can, stop it! No! The vibration generator's begun working. That's crazy! It's impossible! This is a famous hotel in Tokyo. This is Ginza Street. It's too cruel! The expressway. You know our power now? Why did you cause such a disastrous earthquake? To the people on earth! Surrender at once! We on Zigra Planet lived in the sea. But cultural progress polluted water. And we could no longer live there. So we checked on planets having seas. We also went to the moon. Finally, we found an ideal planet. It is your earth where 70% of the surface is covered by seas. But recently your seas are becoming polluted by sludge too. If we leave the earth to you... sludge will cover your beautiful seas. To the people on earth. Surrender at once. We will make the earth our colony. We will take over the seas. Offer no resistance. It is useless for you to defy us. Please testify. I'm Ishikawa of the International Marine Lab. What the Zigra Planet member said is true. But it's crazy! Zigra members are insane! Tom! What's up? What's wrong? I know, Helen! Don't look at her eyes! Wait, Kids! She's stopped moving! Ken, let's run away! How? Opposite of how we came? Get hold of yourself! It's moving! Get on! Get on! Papa, wake up! So much trouble! Helen, we can't go! Isn't it that green button? Hurry! Hurry! We did it! Pays to try, doesn't it? Father! Get a hold on! Papa, wake up! He won't. Hypnotized. How can we wake them? Hurry, let's run away! How do we start the engine? Ken, try hard! Can't! A spaceship's easy. A motorboat's simple but not my bag. Go and follow those two children. Kill them. They know too much of the secrets in this spaceship. Find and kill them. I think it's quicker to kill all the Japanese people. No. Don't kill off the people. On earth, people live on land... And eat things living in the sea. But it is just the opposite with us. We live in the sea... and eat things living on the land. So you must not kill land animals. Let them live so they can become our food. I understand! Follow the children and kill only those two. There's a ship! Can't we go there? No, I'm afraid we can't. Hurry or we'll get caught again. Coming this way! Father! Father, wake up! Help! Help! Coming again! It's the end! What's that? It's Gamera! Gamera, help us! Please, Gamera! Gamera! Save us! Hurry, Hurry! Good, Gamera! Gamera! Groovy! I love Gamera. Girls! Over doing it! Gamera! Papa and your father? We'll get help! Hurry! Thanks, Gamera! See you again! Acting like Gamera's yours! Where are we? Nobody around. No people live here? Terrible if no one does! Let's go! Say! What're you doing here? We ran away to the world of the past. It can happen? Called Time Travel. We can choose the past or the future. What're you mumbling about? I'm sorry! We came on a Time Travel from 1991. Forgive us. The spaceship's fault. He wouldn't understand. You're the ones caught by someone from Zigra Star? You know about it? There was a news special on it a little while ago. What year is this? It's the year 1991, of course. Stop dreaming and wake up! What you're wearing doesn't look like it. This? You see, Lord Minamoto came here 800 years ago. Niyemon, my ancestor, hid him on this island. It's been called Niyemon Island ever since. Dressed like this, we call ourselves Niyemon. This is Niyemon Island near Kamogawa? Am I glad! Boys now are no good. Any counter-measures? Are the two men conscious? Wait, please! A press meeting in one hour! Listen. Until your fathers wake up... You're the only ones who saw the Zigra spaceship. Think well and answer us. All right. Shoot. Inside the spaceship? Like ones we see on TV. Television? Don't you watch TV? You're old hat. Kenichi. The Zigran you saw there? Same as us. She spoke Japanese very well. Japanese? Only one girl. A woman? My mommy's prettier. No, mine's prettier. No, mine. No, mine. Now, now, both your mothers are beautiful. Did she have any special ability? What's that? Something ordinary people can't do. I know! My father has that! He makes noises while he eats. Kenichi! Getting back to the spaceship. Tell us more. Nothing much, really. This is a crummy place. They don't even serve us fruit juice. Helen, no! Shall we take a break? We must wait till the men recover. Ready? Yes. Pulse and blood pressure normal. Brain waves first. I can't believe it. What is it, Doctor? Hard to say, but... Those are not the brain waves of a human being. It's hypnotism! Cracking her fingers did it! Yes, it's hypnotism. Then they can be awakened? It's simple. We tried every means possible. So it's not simple hypnotism in this case. Sir! UN HQ is calling you! Find a way to wake them quickly. Mother! Don't cry, Margie. I'm the Defense Army Commander. We'll take action at once! UN HQ has decided to attack Zigra! Get ready! The Earth Defense Army attacks. The target at latitude 34째 north, longitude 120째 east is moving north. Set depth charge at 1200m! Flight Leader, come in! Come in! It seems they were all wiped out. Any way to stop Zigra? It's weak point? Wait! The people's safety comes first! Evacuate the people at once! Find those two children and kill them. Roger. Hurry. Wait. Do we have to? Hurry. Evacuation orders are out! Hurry. Only this much fish today? Scared of the monster. No one went out to fish. I'll buy them all. No, I will! What's that? You may think being a hotel manager's great, but not me! We both work at the Sea World! You feed dolphins, I feed people. A big difference. Please evacuate! Who's buying the fish? Me! Me! Go ahead! You'd better evacuate too. No! Waiting for food at the aquarium! I'm taking these! You hurry and run away! Joking? I need these for our guests! They've evacuated! Don't lie to me! They did at other inns and hotels! But I'm staying even if I'm alone! Are you crazy? What's the use of staying with no guests? Come and see! Okay. You'll be sorry if you're wrong! Look. It's because I stayed. Our hotel was assigned to newsmen. I'll stay as long as one guest remains! I'll die here! I won? Who cares about people? My animals are waiting for me! I'll die at the aquarium! So there! The number 1 Kamogawa crank! Maybe, I'm number 2. All talk! It burns me up! Bragging he's a manager! Hurry, evacuate. It's dangerous. A Sea World man? There's a Marine Lab? Two children live there? You mean Ken and Helen? Yes. Take me there. I haven't seen you around here. I just came. From Onjuku or somewhere? Yes. The lab people live there. I see. Thanks. You! You! We've news from all parts of the world. No jet planes, battleships or missiles are left. Our weapons cannot cope with Zigra. Has the UN HQ thought of H-bombs? Yes. But all the people may die while Zigra survives. Ridiculous! We pay taxes for protection! I'm sorry, but we can depend on weapons only so far. Brace up! What is it? He seems in a trance. He walks if he's led, that's all. He's like a sleep-walker. Same as the lab men? Take him to the clinic. It's very strange. Is there a Zigra soldier here too? No, absolutely not! Tokyo's a sea of flames. Even Tokyo Tower... As you can see, it's a sad sight. It's Gamera! Gamera! Gamera has come! He loves to eat flames. We must end this broadcast. Flames are drawing closer. It is dangerous here. Zigra 's burned homes and killed people. Don't lose hope and fight. Will Zigra conquer the earth? We won't lose to Zigra! No. That Zigra! Run, Helen! Don't look into her eyes! Don't! Wait! Boy! Don't be afraid! Helen, hurry! I've seen her before. She's Miss Sugawara. Miss Sugawara? Miss Sugawara! The switch. We can't get away! I'm mad! I wish Gamera would come. Only Gamera can beat Zigra. Where is he? Gamera! To the people on earth! Stop your useless resistance. I have lost my spaceship due to Gamera 's attack. So I cannot return to the Zigra Planet. And your water pressure is dimerent from ours. So it has made me abnormally large. I'll retaliate by destroying all the people on earth. Then I will take possession of all your beautiful seas. You are too ugly... And not fit to use them freely. I am beautiful... And should rule the seas. My friend on earth has begun the work of wiping you all out. Monster, earthquake or whatever, I won't leave you. Never. Help! Wait, Boy! I believe they should be taken to a safe place first. Mrs. Ishikawa. A guide's evacuating the children? It's hard catching them. No, I haven't asked any guide. That's funny. Are the men conscious? No, Sir. Strange. They can't see but walked without bumping into anything. Maybe it's... What is it? A word! The men! Will you let the dolphin out? I don't understand complicated things. This dolphin's blind but never bumps into a wall. Same with the men? A good sixth sense? A dolphin's supersonic waves bounce back from a wall. So it avoids the wall. Same as a submarine's sonar? Yes. Hearing the waves for long periods may affect human brains. Their brains have become like those of the dolphin. I see! Zigra is an aquatic. So he's changed their brains to control them. They can be cured! Lend me your transceiver. You're conscious? Why are we here? I was right! The transceiver waves made their brains normal again! We owe it to the dolphins. Trouble, Sir! The newsmen have been hypnotized! A Zigran's among us! Wait! Wait! Stay away! Spare them! I'll do anything you say! You can't fool me! You'll die too! I'll die with them! Where am I? Why am I here? I was on the moon! On the moon? I'm Chikako Sugawara, a geologist, I was on a moon base. I was going on a moon Jeep to check a crater. Bathed in a mysterious ray, I lost consciousness. When I came to, I was beside the pool. I understand now. The ray made you Zigra's captive. You were brainwashed to help Zigra. Tell us Zigra's weak points or any special traits you remember. I don't remember anything. Or what I did. There is no way to save mankind? There is a limit to human power. There's Gamera even if people can't do anything! He smashed Zigra's spaceship! He'll beat Zigra! But he's laying upside-down in the sea. But he's not dead? It may be a vain hope, but... Let's see if he's alive. He may be our only hope to defend the earth. He may be our only hope to defend the earth. Is there any way to do it? Yes, Sir. We have a deep-sea diving bathyscaph. Leave checking the sea to us. I see. Our dads are smart. Bathyscaph here. Over. Chopper here. Over. Approach Gamera 10m more. Roger. Stop! From here, Gamera seems dead. Use sonar on his brain waves. Roger! Tom, the sonar. If the ray Gamera was exposed to is the same one used on me, the sonar sound waves may revive him! That's it, exactly! What's that sound, Father? It's so noisy! You kids! Oh, my God! How did you? I'm sorry they sneaked on. We'd lose time surfacing, so we'll take them. Kenichi! No, Helen! What's this? Don't bother us, Kenichi. Helen. Behave now. There's no change in Gamera. Intensifying the sound waves. Papa! It's Zigra! Come in Bathyscaph! Begin, Tom. Bathyscaph here! Don't worry. This bathyscaph can surface. Begin, Tom. Can't. A short circuit. Return as soon as you can. We will. Please don't worry. Look after the kids! That Zigra! Are we safe? Yes, we are. How is it? Ready soon. The depth gauge. Hold on and be quiet. 8000. 9000. 10,000. The Japan Deep. Dr. Ishikawa! Dr. Wallace! Counter-measures HQ! Come in! Bathyscaph here. Can you see us? We see you fine! Are you all right? Yes, we're all safe. But the depth is 12,300m! We're worried about the water pressure. Surfacing apparatus? Not working. We're checking, but after that tumble... Father, what if we can't go up? We'll wait till help comes. How much oxygen's left? Enough for one hour. She's leaking pretty badly! Please pull us up! Mother! Buck up! We're all right! Don't worry! Don't worry. Can they be saved? Not even nuclear submarines can dive 12,000 meters. There's one more bathyscaph in France. But it can't be brought here in an hour. Are you going to let them die? Hiroko. Don't worry. We'll fix the surfacing apparatus! We won't lose hope! Please do that! The surfacing apparatus is completely damaged. What's the matter, Mr. Ishikawa? Please answer! It's Zigra! A light! Zigra's eyes are dazzled! Light is its weak point? Yes! We know its weak point! A deep-sea monster, it hates the light. Gamera pulled it up. Instinctively, Gamera knew its weak point. To the people on the earth. Surrender to me. It is very easy for me to destroy the bathyscaph. If you want to save the bathyscaph, surrender within an hour... And I will save it. I remember now. Zigra's a deep-sea animal, so it feeds on human beings. After the surrender it'll keep people like chickens for food. Your oxygen? Enough for 50 minutes! We will surrender! Wait! We can't let them die! Contact UN HQ! Zigra. Can you hear me? You are far more advanced in science than we are. I think you heard us. We surrender to you. Bring up the bathyscaph! Very well. Turn om the light in the bathyscaph. We're safe! Isn't it nice? No! Even if you surrender, mankind will become its food! Listen, Mr. Ishikawa! You're a marine expert? Recall Zigra's characteristics! I can say no more. Zigra will hear me. Think of what I'm trying to say! It's the last chance to save mankind! Its characteristics? I see now! Go on up! Raise the voltage! A success! This is Countermeasures HQ! Please answer! Dr. Ishikawa! Dr. Wallace! Please answer! Kenichi! I'm sorry I failed in my last try! If I hadn't said that! No, we'll all become Zigra's food sooner or later! Gamera's gone! Will he save the bathyscaph? Even so... the supply of oxygen gave out 8 hours ago. Then they have died from suffocation? Save them! Suffocation? Dead but not by suffocation. It's strange. The ray stopped cell activity! The cells are dormant! They're not dead? Then there's hope of reviving them! Chikako angered Zigra. Due to its ray, they didn't die? Exactly! If they'd sumocated, we couldn't revive them! Thank you, Chikako! Thank me after they recover. How will you treat them? With electric shocks. The lightning revived Gamera too. I see. Get ready to cure them. Yes, Sir. Yes, Sir. I'm thirsty. Some juice, please. Gamera! Gamera! Your jet propulsion! Goodbye, Gamera! You're groovy, Gamera! Kenichi! Keep the sea clean. Zigra, drawn toward our beautiful seas, met its death. It's a disgrace for us to pollute the seas. Gamera and Zigra taught us to value them with their lives. Yes. Thank you, Gamera! Gamera, Gamera. You're strong, Gamera. Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday... Mars, Venus, some other stars. Space monster... Come what may. It cuts, it pokes, go-go-go. You've jet propulsion, we know. You're strong, Gamera. THE END
