Oh... uh, you guys are doing great, and this is probably isn't what you want to hear, but you have a few lights out in front. Couldn't have told us sooner? Sorry! Just saw. Dave, don't worry about it. I brought plenty of extras. You're my hero. Are those the ornaments? Oh, yeah. Hot from the kiln. They cooled off, though, so. Ooh, Thomas, these are amazing. Thanks. I made some for your cabin and mine. You guys! Beckett, breathe. What's wrong? Chris Dreskin. What about him? He got the part of the Christmas Prince. In the pageant? No, in the new Season of Lost. Yes, in the pageant! I mean, you did beat him out last year for the lead. Maybe it's his turn. Peyton, this is theater, not kindergarten. It should be based off talent, not taking turns. Beckett, you're super talented, and whatever role they give you, I'm sure you'll crush. And in a few years, when you're a big Broadway superstar, you're not even gonna remember the name Chris Dreskin. You're right. I wonder where you all will be by then. Hopefully, not too busy to come see my shows. Oh, well, Peyton will probably be a prize-winning writer, so. &gt;Well, whatever we're doing, I just hope we all keep in touch. Ooh, is that the new manuscript? Yeah. I'm just, you know, waiting for the right time. Thank you. Peyton! She beckons! Good luck. Did you send the edits of the cookbook? Yes, and they would like to schedule a call for the new year. No, needs to be sooner. See if they're free next week? On it. I also need the contracts sent for Danny's book and I needed Blair on the line, like, five minutes ago. Okay. Will do. Peyton... I do appreciate you working over Christmas. Hopefully, your parents don't mind? Oh, no, and they're coming here this year. Besides, our big Christmas celebration happens in July. Oh. What do you mean? Well, my parents own a summer camp in Cascade County, Montana, and my great-grandmother started this tradition of celebrating Christmas in July for the campers, so it's this huge thing for us. That sounds nice. Make sure you let me know when Blair's on the line. Uh, Mona? I know you are... Well, you're super swamped right now, but would it be okay if I left this on your desk? Another one? I think you'll really like this one. So, it's a deep dive into the history of the Shanghai Tunnels. It has everything from ghost sightings, to murder, to... Okay, well, put it on the pile and I'll try to get to it. Okay. Peyton, honey, the lack of Christmas decorations in here is borderline insulting. Well, I know, Dad. I didn't get a chance to grab much this year. I think there's some extra lights in the RV. No, no, no, no, no. You two, don't worry about any of that. Just eat, relax, and enjoy yourselves, and as soon as I finish these emails, I'll join. Before that, your dad and I want to tell you something. And we didn't want to do it over the phone, That's one reason why we insisted on driving down here this year. Is... is everything okay? Your father and I have made a very hard decision. It's time for us to retire. Oh, wow. Well, that's... That's great news, isn't it? Now you can do that traveling you've always talked about. Finally put some miles on that RV of yours? You realize this means no more Camp Evergreen. Well, maybe you can sell it or find someone else to run it. I know you said in the past it's something you weren't interested in, but maybe you've changed your mind? Peyton... you've been working with Mona for years now without getting any closer to becoming a published writer. What do you say... you come home, carry on the family tradition? Mom, we've been through this. I love that camp, and it's a part of me. I just... well, I don't want all the responsibility that comes with it. We know that. Right, dear? Had to ask one last time, just in case. Well, the good news is that in honor of us closing the doors, we're going to throw one more Christmas in July week for all of the Camp Evergreen alumni and their families. It's going to be a huge reunion! Everybody who has ever taken part in the tradition can come back and relive it one more time. That's a great idea! Yeah. This means you, too. Oh, I will do everything I can to be there. I mean, it's the end of an era. End of an era. Well, should we just order, or? Oh, she said she'd be here any minute. Okay. There she is. Hey, guys! Sorry I'm late. It is hard to get out for lunch these days. Trust us, we get it. It's so good to see you both. You too. Hey, how was the conference? Really great. Adventurer Clothing Co. Was voted best outdoor gear company by Trek and Venture magazine. - Ta-dah! - What? That is amazing! - Congratulations! - Thank you. I mean, it's all Janice. She's been killing it in product development. Aw, that's sweet of you to say, babe, but it's a team effort. 15 something years, and you two are still adorable. I agree. I agree. Yeah. Speaking of which, I can't believe your parents are saying goodbye to the camp! I know, it's crazy. I don't know, a part of me just expected them to be running that place forever. I always pictured our kids would go there someday. Granted, if we ever have kids. Yeah... It's just impossible with our schedule these days, but... someday, though. Please tell me you're coming to the Christmas in July reunion. Beckett already called me, he said he's gonna be there. Ooh, I'm not sure I can get the time off work. You know... You guys know my boss. Is that it, or is it really because of you know who? Who? Oh, Thomas. Oh, yeah. Should have known. Listen, I talked to him a couple of weeks ago. He's teaching at a summer school, so I don't think he's coming. Oh, yeah. Apparently, he's an art teacher at a fancy academy in Texas. Wow. Well... good for him. Kelly, are you still cool to cover me next week? AKA be at Mona's beck and call 24/7? For you, I will do my best. Oh, thank you. Did she give you the go ahead? Not yet. I'm just waiting for the right time to remind her. - Yeah. - Peyton! Come here! Ask and you shall receive. You won't believe what just happened. Everything okay? Blair, the Savannah travel guide writer, just broke both her wrists... Hang gliding. Oh, geez. We have to push her book, which means I need to find something else to fill my slate, ASAP. Do you remember my manuscript on the Shanghai tunnels? Maybe that could take its slot? I do, and although it was well written, I don't think it's quite right for us. But the history of what's literally underneath Portland is fascinating. Right, and if we were a textbook company, perhaps that might work, but here, we publish books that have a personal angle. Blair grew up in Savannah, the Civil War book from last month came from a descendent of McClellan. Your samples never seem to have a personal connection to the subject matter. Well, I guess I always thought the connection was just shared human interest. Mm... needs a little more than that. But the good news is you can have that vacation time approved. As long as I barely notice you're gone. Kelly will cover for me. Get me a list of all the projects we have on deck. Wait, so, if I brought you a book idea that's more personal... then you'd consider? Sure. I have to present my project lineup to the board in August. Bring me an idea before then... One I can't say no to... And then maybe we can talk. I will find something amazing. Make it work on every level! Thank you! Don't thank me yet. I can't make any promises. Just the fact that you're even considering to give me a shot... means a lot. Make sure Kelly knows how to work that cappuccino machine. Okay. - The prodigal daughter returns! - Sweetheart! Oh! Welcome home! You look wonderful. The place looks great! Well, the same, but, you know, that's why it's great. Is anyone here yet? Oh... We're back, baby! - You made it! - Oh, it's so good to see you! Oh... there's only one person I know who would show up to summer camp in a limo. Surprise, surprise. Is it? The star has arrived! Oh, Beckett, do all Broadway stars get limo rides or are you just special? Pey, you can say "Broadway star" a little louder! Oh, I've missed you! I missed you! Hey, Dave. How's it go... OMG, you've got to be kidding me. Is that Chris Dreskin? Oh! Isn't he on TV now? Like, some secondary character on a soap in L.A.. Big whoop. That's cool. You guys are both actors, both successful. Well, yeah, except I do live theater... You know, I'm, like, a real artist. - Just a little different. - Okay. Well, glad to see the rivalry has died off. Hey, look at this, guys. Whole gang's back together. Yeah. Well, I mean, almost the whole gang. Where's... Uh-uh. - Uh... - No, it... Did I... It's fine. Welcome back, Camp Evergreen Alumni and families! We are so excited to have you all back here this summer to celebrate Camp Evergreen's last Christmas in July. Now, we've got a great week all planned for you! The schedules are posted all around. Tomorrow, you'll all start decorating your cabins for the annual cabin-lighting ceremony. We will also have some camp favorites, like Capture the Wreath... the Snowball Fight... - Ah, that's you. - I remember doing that. And, of course, our Christmas in July pageant! Whoo! Yes! Then on Saturday, we will end with a big Christmas in July party! So, are you all ready to kick this week off? Then let's bring our daughter, Peyton, up. Ever when she was a little girl, it was her job to raise the Christmas in July flag! So, Peyton, for old time's sake? Come on up! Peyton, Peyton! Peyton, Peyton! Nice job. Yeah! Uh-oh, uh-oh. Oh. Well, I'll be, if it isn't Peyton and her crew! Chef Al! It's so good to see you! How do you look even younger? Oh, hush! Chef Al, you should be on the beach somewhere sipping a mai tai. And give up getting to serve you kids? Never! - How about some turkey? - Yes! Thank you. Wait, who's at our table? Oh, Peyton. Tommy boy! Tommy! Hey! I thought I'd save our seats. Hey, man. I thought you had summer school. You're still in school? Teaching summer school. It got canceled... There wasn't enough enrollment. I caught the first plane out. I wouldn't miss the last Christmas in July at Camp Evergreen! I'm so glad you made it. It's so good to be here. Hey, Peyton. Hey, Thomas. I can't believe he's here, and I can't believe the only thing he had to say to me was "Hey, Peyton." Well, that is a greeting... and it is your name. Same bunks! What is that? "Thought you might enjoy a stroll down memory lane. Love, Mom." Oh, wow. What is that? All my old camp journals. Every summer of camp. Oh, my gosh. Judging by these stickers, I'm guessing we were 16. "First day of camp! We're finally counselors in training! This is going to be the best summer ever." Ever! "P.S. Thomas grew a few inches. He's looking good, but Beckett got frosted tips and looks super cute." Oh, my gosh, I forgot about the summer you came in hard crushing on Beckett! I know! I thought our mutual interest of Michael Bublé and shoes meant we were soulmates. Naturally. "Lately, Janice always picks the same activity as Dave instead of me. Pretty sure they're going to be an item by the end of the summer." "I get it, though, and, hey, it gives me time to hang with Thomas. Today, he helped me make a prop for the pageant. It was... fun." Oh... the journey our hormones went on that summer! Oh, I know. If only I could warn that young Peyton not to fall so hard. Have you ever thought maybe this is your shot to reconcile with Thomas? Uh... I don't think that's possible. Besides, I don't need that kind of distraction right now. It's been years of me trying to get my boss to see me as more than her assistant. So I'm using this rare time off to focus on an idea that she can't say no to. Well, I am going to get ready for bed. And I am going to use this time. I am not sleeping next to my husband, who snores like a freight train. I'm going to get some really good sleep. Hey, uh... is... is everything okay with you two? Yeah, of course. It's just that, lately, whenever I bring up the kids thing, he dodges it, and I'm starting to wonder if maybe he doesn't want them anymore. What? You know that's not true. I'm sure it's just work. And, hey, maybe you should use this time off... to try to talk to him about it. Yeah. Maybe. No ink stains. Excuse me? Back in the day, you always used to write with those gel pens, and you had ink stains on your hands. Yeah, I used to have one in every color. I was heading to the dining hall for some hot chocolate. Can I grab you one? No thanks. You look good. I mean, of course, you would, just it's been a while since I saw you. I'm sorry. I feel like that came out weird. You look good, too. About what happened... Thomas, let's not. I mean, there's no point in drudging all that up. I want to. But I don't. Let's just be civil, enjoy the week. So, I'll let you... Okay, now this is exactly what I picture when I think of baby Peyton. First one awake, fresh camp air, just so eager to raise that Christmas in July flag. Uh... no, I don't think "eager" is the right word. I mean, part of living here full-time meant it was always on my chore list. Yeah, but you loved it. Yeah, I did. It made me feel like the day was filled with endless possibilities. Aw, that's so sweet. Beckett, just the man we wanted to see. Oh, yeah! I get that a lot. Since you are a professional Broadway actor, we were hoping... We would be honored if you would be in charge of the Christmas pageant this summer. I am the one who would be honored. I literally got my start doing these pageants. You know I'm already having all these ideas for what it could be, right? Great, so you and Chris can start right away. Wait, I'm sorry, did you... did you say Chris? What does he have to do with this? We're putting you both in charge. Oh, no, I think they forgot. Forgot what? Mom! Beckett and Chris... They were camp theater rivals. That's just silly. You're both adults, you're both successful actors. You're our camp stars. Come on! You guys are going to be great. Chris! Come on over for a second. Beckett. Chris. Looks like you and I will be co-directing this thing, huh? Yeah... You guys, we always rocked at decorating this cabin. If it was a competition, you know we would have won. Yeah, because you always had Dave and Thomas over here helping you with yours instead of decorating our cabin. Hey. It was a team effort. The girls helped us with ours, too. Yeah, and thankfully, because remember the one year that we didn't, and yours ended up looking like a Christmas fun house... Complete with those weird mirrors? It seemed like a good idea at the time. All right, creativity pushes boundaries, you guys. Anyway, it seems like you guys all got this under control, so I'm gonna go find that "soap actor" and start explaining to him that we will be doing my vision for the pageant this year. Bye! All right, well, we're going to go get some lights. Are you guys cool to start making ornaments? Us? Yeah, are you okay with that? - Great. - Totally cool. - Okay. - Okay. See you. Wow. Is that who I think it is? Hey, Ellen. Thomas! Oh! I get your Christmas card every year! I can't believe you became an art teacher. All thanks to you. You send out a Christmas card? Just to Ellen. Peyton. So glad you're home. Oh, thank you. Can you believe it's our last Christmas in July? It doesn't even feel real. I know. Hey... I've got a great idea! Okay! Can I have your attention? Everyone! For those of you who don't know... this is Thomas, one of my most prized campers... Well, mostly because he followed in my footsteps and became an art teacher. When he was a counselor here, he used to teach the campers how to make wire-star ornaments. Thomas, lead us in a demonstration? Sure! All right, everyone grab some wire or pipe cleaners. Perfect, yeah. And then wrap the wire around each peg... Like this. Hey, Teacher? Am I doing this right? Yes! And if you want this tighter... just... I'm glad you became an art teacher. It suits you. What about you? You writing? Oh, not professionally, but, I mean, I do when I can, but... currently, I'm an assistant to an editor at a publishing company. Do you like it? At first, I thought it was a good foot in the door, but every time I try to make my move, I'm just faced with more and more rejection. I hope you never give up. I always loved your writing. - Really? - Yeah. All those letters you wrote me between summers. You always made me feel like I was right there with you, able to see things through Peyton's point of view. Thanks. That's really nice of you to say. It's true. I think I'm done. You're ready to move on to more complicated shapes. You think? I'll show you how to make Rudolph? You're the teacher. All right. Okay, so that's when Santa comes out, but he's dressed in more of, like, a tropical look, and then, bam, the orchestra kicks in, and starts playing "Copacabana". You're joking right? You want a tropical-dressed Santa to come out and sing "Copacabana"? And what orchestra? The rec room has a 30-year-old stereo? Jeez, sorry for thinking outside the box and trying to push us creatively. Well, what's your great idea, then? The nativity story. Revolutionary! It is a Christmas pageant. And we've seen that story, like, a million times. Let's do something new. Okay, this is the last one! Exactly why we should stick to something more traditional. Veto. You can't veto. We have to agree on this. Do we? We come bringing handmade ornaments. Ooh, I want to see. Babe, babe, babe, hold the ladder, please. - Oh, sorry. - Pretty please. You okay up there? Apparently, spending all day every day in an office has given him a newfound fear of heights. Hey, guys, cabin's looking great! Thanks. Picked some mistletoe off the hickories if you guys want to hang some up? I love that this is the one place we welcome the invasion of mistletoe on our trees. He's so adorable. I got your note. That's beautiful. Thanks. It's my favorite spot at camp. It's better at night, when everyone's asleep. Well, now it's my favorite spot, too. You know, that garland, it's... it's got some of the hickory tree's mistletoe on it. - Is that so? - Mm-hmm. Well. too bad it's around us and not above us. - Hello. - Hey! I thought... we could put these up before the lighting later. Wow! Official company merch... I like it. Where's your co-CEO? Dave? He's on a work call. Our job is not exactly 9 to 5. I love that you guys ended up owning an outdoor adventure company. I mean, I should have known with all the stuff that Dave used to make us carry on our hikes. Do you guys ever think about what you'd be doing with your lives if you didn't come to camp? Like, would I have fallen in love with theater? I never thought about it. Oh, come on. You would have been a hand model. - Thanks? - Yeah. No, no, no. Beckett is onto something. I just realized you all work in professions that started here at camp. Yeah. I mean, except for me, but... Yeah. What are you talking about? You work in publishing, and you were always writing in your journals here at camp. No, no, no. Come on, a trained monkey could do my job. - No. - Yes. And I guess I just always thought I'd be a real writer by now. You are a real writer. Yeah. I'm... I'm okay, and I'm very happy that you all found success. Janice, you wanted more lights for the side of the cabin, yeah? Yes. I'm done eating, I'll go grab some. See ya. I'm going to go help her out. I'll get Alfie in to fix it. What a mess. Hey, is everything okay? - Yeah. - Not okay. The roof is leaking. Completely ruined the wreaths for Capture the Wreath. Game's tomorrow. Everyone was looking forward to it. Well, don't worry, Mom. I'm sure we can find new ones. Honey, it's July. None of the local stores are going to be carrying wreaths. I'll make some. You don't mind? Not at all. We're surrounded by pine trees, I think I got this. Yeah, and I can help. Great! Hey, thank you for offering to do this. I know it means a lot to my parents. They mean a lot to me. Hey, how about your parents, how are they? I lost my dad a few months ago. Thomas, I'm so sorry. He was sick for a while, but... still, when... it finally happened, it felt like being hit by a train. I'm so sorry. One of the days near the end, he... he sat down and he told me... about all of these things that he wished he had done differently. It was really hard to hear. But I think he did it because he didn't want me to live with regrets. Have you? Yeah. But thanks to my him, I'm going to change that. That's why I'm here. I want to make things right. I forgot how much pine needles shed. Yeah, you do have a bunch stuck in your hair. Oh! Sorry. They're all in there. Now we're even. Oh! You did not just do that. - No! Not the glitter. - No, I would never do it. - It's really hard to get out. - I would never do it. Hard to get out! - You're done. - No, you don't... No, you don't... That's it! That's it! The very first tradition my grandmother started for Christmas in July was decorating each of the cabins, and tonight, we celebrate her legacy with the last lighting ceremony! For one last time, let's light this camp up! 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1! How much you want to bet Beckett ropes us into being in the pageant this year? Oh, I do not make bets I know I'll lose. So, there's an opening on our publishing slate, and my boss made it clear that if the right idea came along, she'd consider it. The only problem is that she's turned down every one of my manuscripts I've ever brought to her, so. What kind of stuff have you brought her that she turns down? Expository non-fiction. Hey! Sorry that I minored in history and love documenting the past. But she says it lacks a personal connection. So you need to find a subject matter that's personal to you but still tickles your history geekdom. Ooh. Easy, right? I'm sure the right idea will come to you. I forgot how beautiful this place can be. You know, I think... I think growing up here year-round, I took it for granted. It's easy to do that when you're young. To not realize what you have until it's gone. Great breakfast, you guys. Always. Hey, so what is with all the boxes? One of the hardest things about selling the camp is having to go through everything. We're not hoarders, but we're not minimalists either, that's for sure. And the silver lining is finding some treasures. Come, come. You have to see this. Oh, wow! What was I wearing? That was your tie-dye-everything phase. Oh, wait... Was that the winter that you guys rented the camp out to the pastry school? Remember everything smelled like cinnamon for a year. - Right. - We loved it. Oh, look, and there's you... Christmas in July at what? 10? Yes! Yes, that was the summer that Janice and I got put in the same bunk. Instant besties. Oh, I know. I love this. So many memories. Not sure what we're going to do with all of this. Probably put it in storage? No, it should be preserved... in a book! Wait, can I... Can I take these? Well, yeah! Then we don't have to pack them. Thank you. Here you go. Okay, thank you, guys. Well, um... well, I'll see you later. - Okay. - Perfect. Hmm. - Hey, guys, guess what. - What? So, the personal story I've been looking for is Camp Evergreen! Our Christmas in July tradition. That is the book I'm going to pitch to my boss. That's perfect. It can't get more personal than that. Right? Oh! Am I going to be in it? I'm sure you'll all be in it. I still have to pitch the idea first, though. Hey! You guys! So... Beckett, you are going to be on red team with Peyton and I, just like old times! No! Janice! I know it's been a really long time, but I don't really play sports. I have a designated Capture the Wreath sunbathing spot right over there. Well, too bad, because we don't have as many people this year. Oh! Yes, well, funny that you would say it like that, actually, because I might need all of you this year... And by "might," I mean I do. For what? Remember how much fun we all had when we were up on stage together? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No. I knew this was going to happen. I knew this was going to happen. I called it. So barely anyone signed up for the pageant, and I really, really, really, really need you guys. All right, but only... But only because we love you. Oh, thank you! Thank you! Oh, I promise it will be so much fun and you guys will all be great and you'll shine! And I will just do what I can with you, okay? Great! All right, well, that means you're playing Capture the Wreath. Wait, don't worry, Beckett. I mean, you're on the winning team. - Yeah. - Whoa. If memory serves me correctly, the green team always won. No, no, no. Remember that game when we were, like, 16? The one that we won in the last minute? The one we won in the last minute. Okay, trust me, I remember that game like it was yesterday. No, I remember that game like it was yesterday. Well, it is just too bad that there is no documentation, play by play of exactly how that day went. Oh, wait. - Uh-huh. - Okay. Nice try. You know, red looks really good on you. You're not sweet-talking this wreath away from me. I have an idea. Does it mean running past you for the win? No. No, no. I will let you get to the other side if... you agree to become my camp girlfriend? You think I'm going to give up red team dominating this year's Capture the Wreath? Well, I mean, it's a fair trade. It's a win-win. Oh, Thomas, how little you know the ways to a woman's heart. And then you scored the winning point. Yup. Oh, and remember what I said to you when you came up to congratulate me? That we could become official as long as I never underestimated you again. So you do remember. Yeah. See, I get why I thought that we won that year... I did end up with the real prize. Oh! That was really cute. Um... okay, well, we should go take our spots. I come bearing great news. I just got us four more cast members. Oh, so you just asked your friends? Friends, fellow thespians. Same diff. Did you ask yours? Nope. Mine are not performers. Well, mine are all very talented. I've seen them act. Remember the pageant of '07? Dave had the line written on his hands. Oh, yeah, you mean the summer that I was supposed to play the Christmas Prince, but it somehow mysteriously went to you instead? I was better for the role. You stole my audition song. I didn't steal your song! That was Maroon 5's latest hit... The number one song that summer! We all sang it! Okay. All right. What about the pageant of '04? Remember that? You were so upset that I was the lead that you switched out the prop food's green frosting for wasabi. Luckily, I was super-profesh, even back then, and made it part of my performance! In my defense, I was 12. Yeah, whatever. You've always had a problem with me, just admit it. I did not have a problem with you, I had a crush on you! What? Um... yeah, I, uh... never mind I said that, huh? I gotta... go to that sports practice Christmas thing. I'm going! That's what I'm talkin' about! - I'll give you this. - Thank you, sir. Still the best hiding spot in the game. I should have known. So what's the deal you're going to try and make with me this time? A second chance? At tagging you. Not if you can't catch me. Peyton, you'll never guess what just happened. A little busy here, Beck. Oh, right, the game. Beckett, catch! I did it! I won the game! Good game. Sorry you were too slow. Yeah. I missed my chance, for sure. Yeah, okay. A crush? I, like, legitimately did not even know Chris was gay. Did you? - Did any of you? - No. He did always compliment my smile, but... That doesn't help anything. You have a beautiful smile. Thanks to four years of braces! Yeah. So what now? Yeah, did it seem like the crush was a thing of the past, or, like... still happening? No clue. You guys are going to have to, like, feel out the vibes at rehearsal. Oh, yeah. Wait, I hope that's not this morning, 'cause I have to head into town. - Oh, no, you're fine. - Okay. Town? Oh, you guys remember how exciting it was to go into town when we were kids? It was like a mythical, faraway land. It always felt so rebellious. Totally. Well, I hate to disappoint all of you, but I'm going to the Darlington Library. Girl, what is wrong with you? My parents don't have any documents from when the camp first opened, so, you know, I figured they might have some old articles at the library. If you want some company, I'd love to see if that ice cream shop is still there. Sure! Yeah, if you want. Oh, while you guys are in town, do you think you could get me some supplies for the pageant? 'Cause the props in storage are not cutting it... Especially with that leaky roof. Yes. Sure. Just make a list. Actually, I have one right here, so if you could just... grab me everything right there... In order of importance. - Order of importance? - Yeah. Could you double up on number three and seven? Please? Thank you! - Yes, sir. - Love you! Bye. 1930. It's an article about the property being bought. "Craig and Marion Baker purchased 10 acres of land just north of Darlington. The couple has plans to build a children's summer camp." "With times the way they are, everyone still needs a place to come and experience joy." I didn't realize that Camp Evergreen was built during the Great Depression. Look, here's a photo from opening day. When did the Christmas in July tradition start? I... I think right away? Oh! Here we go. "Whoever thought Christmas was strictly a winter holiday has never met Marion Baker. Founder and leader of Camp Evergreen, Baker has officially declared an entire week of July the new Christmas. The camp will spend the week celebrating the merriest season of all, participating in traditions and activities typically reserved for December. When asked her motivation behind this new holiday, Baker explained that she noticed the campers were getting homesick, missing their families, and she asked herself how could she help them feel more at home? She realized since the camp is a family for the summer, they need to bring the magic of Christmas to the campers." I love that. I knew it was created to bring joy, I just didn't realize it was also to combat homesickness. There's an entire interview in here. "Baker says that the key to a good Christmas celebration is to be with people whose company you enjoy against the backdrop of a place that gives you comfort. That is how she sees Camp Evergreen. Now and forever." Well, it tastes just as good as I remember. This was fun. Granted we only got one thing on Beckett's list, and I think it's a gnome, not an elf, and not made of ice. No. But, hey... we got some great stuff for your book. Yeah. I'm excited to share with the world how much Christmas in July meant to so many people. Mm-hmm. You're melting. Oh, um... Thank you. I know you said not to drudge up the past, but I do want to say... You know, let's not... spoil a good ice cream. And besides, we don't want to be late for rehearsal. - Of course not. - Yeah. I'm Santa? I hate acting. Why am I the lead? Relax. The real lead is the head elf played by me, obviously. Ahem. Right, yeah, actually, there's two head elves this year, played by me and Chris. We're both the stars. Co-stars of the show. Okay. Yeah. I like that. Who's Betty? And who is Skip? You are. You two. You're the other two elves. You have less lines, so it's... Chris came up with those names and I think they're great. Thank you. - So shall we run the lines? - Take five and learn the lines. Oh, no. No, you're right, we should... You guys would probably feel more comfortable if you learned them before we... No, no, we should just dive right in. Right, yes. Great idea. Yeah. Okay, so, you guys, you good? Which... Rudolph... officially Rudolph? - Yeah. - Yes? - No. - Yeah? - Hello. - Hey. Frozen eggnog? Yes, please! You even put in a cinnamon stick. Of course. Oh, wow, look at all this. Yeah, it's all just flowing, you know, how I want to arrange the book, where it starts, where it goes. I feel good. Yeah! I haven't seen you smile this much in a long time. I don't think it's just the book, though. What do you mean? From not seeing the guy for over a decade to spending all this time with him? Well, he has been really supportive... and I forgot how much fun we have together... It's definitely something I've been missing. But, you know, the last thing I want to do is set myself up for the same heartbreak. Thomas and I don't work outside of camp. You know, we already tried and failed. Things can change, people can change. See, this way, we get to take in the show and are clear out of the splash zone. Are you sure we're out of snowball jurisdiction? Totally. You finding something to hide behind? Are those fighting words, Baker? Oh, no. I just want to give you a heads-up you're gonna get pummeled. I think it's you who's going to be the one pummeled. - Nah, I don't think so. - Oh, yeah. Watch your back. All right, everybody, who's ready for a July snowball fight? Not me. Remember, the goal is to stay dry and every camper for themselves! On your mark... get set... Go! - Too close. - No, no, no. No splash zone, kids. - Thank you very much. - You promised me. There should be a sign. I don't see a sign. Uh-uh-uh. No splash zone. Oh, my gosh. Peyton! Sorry I keep missing your calls. Please tell me you've been trying to reach me to let me know you're on your way back. Kelly's doing her best, but she's no you. No, I'm actually... I'm not coming back till Monday, remember? This week is so long. I was actually trying to reach you because... Well, remember when you said that if the right book idea came along, we could talk? Guess I did say that, didn't I? Well, I have a book proposal idea I'm really excited to run by you, and I think you'll really like it. It definitely has a personal angle. Do you have some time to chat now? I have a conference call in five. How about you pitch it to me this Friday? Yes! Yes! That would be great. Good. You set it up. Gotta run. Okay. Yes! Snowmen s'mores time. What's a snowman s'more? Oh, come on, don't tell me you forgot. That's right... I remember how messy these got. Oh, yes. It's the best part. I invented them. What? No, you didn't. Well, I invented giving them candy faces. And I cannot wait to teach your kids how to make them one day. One day. Uncle Beckett's going to spoil them so much. Oh-ho-ho-ho! Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho! Happy Christmas in July! See, now, that I remember. Oh-ho-ho-ho! Please, gather round. Okay. Welcome to Santa's Christmas Campfire! This year, we thought we would have some fun, by going around and asking everyone to share one of their favorite Christmas in July memories. It can be long or short, or sweet, or embarrassing. Ooh. Anything goes! Anything at all! Not to put her on the spot, but, Peyton, you're the best storyteller I know. Would you care to start us off? Sure! Well, the first story that comes to mind happened the summer we were all... I want to say 16 or 17... And that year, we were tasked with making gingerbread "summer" houses... You remember, right? Oh, come on. Yours isn't that bad. Oh... I think I'm just going to put a sign on my house that says "property is condemned." You just need to use more icing, so it stays together better. Thank you, I've used half the tub. Here, this will help keep it together. It's my own special concoction. And I need some peppermints. Do you guys want anything? I guess I'll give this another try. What in the world... Oh... Hey... what's the deal with this frosting? Why did you use your fingers? Why would I not use my fingers? Dude, that is glue! It's a mixture of the strongest glues that I could find in the art room. Why would you use real glue for a gingerbread house? It helps it last longer. I thought we were going to eat these? What? No. I wasn't. Wait, were you? I mean... You could have told me! Okay, okay. Okay. Everybody needs to take a breath. Should Beckett go wash his hands? No, no, no. It won't come off with just water. No, no, no! Don't pull it! It'll peel the skin off! Thomas! What do you mean I'll peel the skin off? This isn't funny! I don't know why you guys are laughing! What is funny about this? Does this look funny? Beckett had that gumdrop stuck to him for two days. You are just so lucky that I can laugh about this now because I was so mad at you. - Do you remember? - Of course, I do. Thank you, Peyton. That was a delight! Thank you. Who's next? I hope the gingerbread house mishap makes it in the book. Yeah. Absolutely. My goal is to make the reader feel like they were a camper here. Good, then I can revisit this place anytime I want. Christmas in July always felt way more important to me than any Christmas in December. Really? Of course. It was all because of you, though. Don't do that. Do what? Tell you the truth? No, because if you really felt that way, you wouldn't have ended things so abruptly. I was 18. Okay, you... You really want to do this? Yes... because I came here to apologize. I hate that I hurt you. Thomas, I tried so hard to make things work after we left camp. I mean, I visited you at college every other week, I... I wrote you letters, emailed, called, and all you did was just pull farther and farther away, until one day, you called and said you couldn't do it anymore, and just blamed it on the long distance. I was terrified of letting you down. Being with you at camp came naturally, it made sense, but out in the real world... the future was so uncertain. My parents got married young and had a horrible divorce. I didn't want that for us. I thought I was doing the right thing. By not calling me back? By just freezing me out? It was your decision to go no contact afterward. Yeah, because I was devastated. I mean, I loved you, and... I mean, maybe I was naive, but I just... thought what we had was bigger than camp, but I was wrong. I want you to know, from the bottom of my heart, I'm sorry. Everything okay? Yeah, just, you know, a lot on my mind. Goodnight. Look, see, that's his arrow. No, no, it's just his arm. And his body... It's more of a square. Okay, do you see those four stars? Yeah, that's his belt. No! It's not Orion! It's Hercules. Well, now you're just naming Greek heroes. Orion is visible in the winter and Hercules is most prominent in summer. Okay, Miss Astronomer, you know what, I'll take your word for it. You're the one who reads way too much. Well, how else am I going to learn everything about the world? I want to learn everything about you. You already know everything. There's still one thing I'm not sure about. What's that? What you'll say to this. To what? I love you. I love you, too. Yeah, thanks, guys. We'll make some tweaks before the run-through. Good job. That... did not go well. You realize what's happening here? We may be trying to stage a $50-million production for a camp Christmas pageant? Well, that, yes, but ever since I told you I had a crush on you, you've been agreeing with everything I've said. You've been agreeing with everything I've said. Which has created the most confusing play in history. Yeah... All right, we need to be honest with each other if this is going to work. You've tried to fit in the plot of five to six '80s movies in a very simple play about Santa and his elves. And there are way too many dance numbers. All right... and I feel like you want all of this to be so straightforward that you're gonna put the entire audience to sleep. - Okay. - Okay. - There. - Yeah. - We were both honest. - Uh-huh. I guess... I'm a more traditional guy and... you're better at thinking outside the box. Well, I do sometimes have a tendency to maybe go a bit, occasionally, at times, over the top. I can cut a few of the dance numbers. - A few? - Okay, all but the finale? That makes more sense. See, we can do this. We just need to come together. I'm in if you're in. Good news, guys. I found a smoke machine! Great, Frank. Thank you! Yeah. Where is everyone? I don't know. Why? Chris and I almost kissed. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah! Oh, Pey, I feel like a teenager again! I feel like I'm finally getting that camp moment all of you guys got and I never had. What do you mean? Come on, Janice and Dave started crushing on each other when they were, like, 10, you got with Thomas after puberty, and I just never had any options... At least I thought I didn't. Wait, I didn't... I didn't know that you felt that way. I wasn't even out to myself back then. I'm sure all of you guys knew, and I knew, too, I just didn't want to be different, so... I never got that camp crush, you know? Or that camp flirt, or that camp kiss. Oh, that sounds crazy, but maybe, finally now, after all these years, I'm going to get a second chance at it. You deserve all the happiness in the world. Thanks, Peyton. So do you. Hey. I was wondering where you went off to after rehearsal. Wanted to finish this sketch. I love it. Just wanted to remember last night, the campfire part. What? You just... You put in the constellation Orion. Yeah, he's one of the constellations in the night sky. No, he's not... He's not visible in the summer. Are you sure? We have had this exact conversation before. I'm pretty sure it felt like déjà vu, but I'm pretty sure I was right the last time, too. Okay, come here. I'll show you. Sorry, can you say that just a little bit louder? You were right, I was wrong. And what is that one actually called? Hercules. It's funny the things that I remember versus what you remember. I remember all the important things. You kissed? And it was a good kiss. I mean, it felt familiar but also new. This is wow! What does this mean? What now? I don't know. We... we said goodnight, went our separate ways, went to bed, and... now here I am telling you. I think this could be the start of something new, a second chance maybe? I just... I don't know. I mean, part of me wonders if we're just caught up in the nostalgia of camp. I live in Portland, he has a job he loves in Texas. See, I feel silly for even thinking it out loud. A kiss might not mean anything, and I don't want to read too much into a fleeting moment. Right, but it's hard not to. I mean, you once dreamt about forever with him. Maybe it can still happen? But I can't let it take up all my brain space capacity. I'm pitching the book to Mona today. I have to get this right. I cannot face another one of her rejections. You're right, you need to focus. Put the kiss on the back burner. After you tell me all the details. Okay, okay. You know, I just want to say before I start, I am so thrilled to be sharing this idea with you, and I think it's exactly what Lincoln Hill Publishing has been missing. Well, let's see what you got. I do have a hard out at 5:00, though. I will jump right in. Calvin Coolidge once said that Christmas is not a time nor a season, but a state of mind, and no one embodied this idea more than my great-grandmother, Marion Baker, the founder of Christmas in July. Rudolph, your sleigh... Your sleigh... Your sleigh machine... What is it? No. You know what... I'm writing my lines on my hand again. Don't tell Beckett. He's going to freak out. How did you and Janice do it? Make it last? You know, not let all the insecurities of young love creep in? I don't know. I guess I just never let that overtake how I felt about her. You know, before I came to camp, I always felt like something was missing. I met her, and it just... that feeling was gone. I know that's cheesy, and I was young, but... I also knew that it was rare. I wish I could have been more like you. What do you mean? With Peyton? We kissed last night. - Whoa. - Yeah. It was... it was incredible. I came here wanting to apologize, instead, I end up falling in love with her all over again. Isn't that a good thing? Why don't you look happy about it? I'm scared, just like I was the last time, that I'm going to mess it up, the way my parents did. Thomas, you're not them. You're you. Maybe we should both stop being scared about taking the next step. I'm afraid I'm not going to be a good dad. That is literally impossible. You have always been the guy who puts his mind to something and succeeds. Your relationship with Janice, your company, everything. This will be no different. Pageant Santa, on the other hand, that needs some work. - A lot of work. - Yeah. Wow. That moved me. It did? Yes. The way it began, how it adapted over the years... Oh, the traditions. You're really on to something here. Now, who did you have in mind to write it? Um... I'm confused, I thought it was obvious. I want to write this book. I think you're a bit too green, not enough experience for something of this caliber. But so much of the book will be coming from my journals, my memories, my family connection. You wanted a personal story, this is personal. Oh, I gotta pop off, but let me think about it, okay? Okay. - Hey. - Hey. You weren't at breakfast. How was the pitch? It... well, it didn't go exactly as I hoped. I'm sorry. Yeah, Mona said she'd think about it, but, you know, that usually means no. This time could be different. I just... I don't think I'm cut out to be a writer. Of course you are. Well, maybe this is bad timing, but I was hoping that we could... talk about the other night? Yeah, of course. All right! Gather 'round, fellow thespians! This is it! You do need that many sparkles. Don't even ask. You guys, just remember to have fun out there, okay? And if you do forget any of the choreography, I'll kill you. Okay. Chris. Anything you want to say? Let's do Camp Evergreen's legacy proud! Rudolph, look! We're at the North Pole! Your time machine sleigh worked. Oh! The only way we'll know if we successfully closed the time loop and saved the elves from the avalanche in the North Pole is if we see them in the workshop. Wait! I think I hear something. Oh! That's the sound the elves make during their celebration dance after they finish making all the presents! Oh! We did it! We saved the elves and we saved Christmas! Cue the lights. Best pageant ever. These are for you. That's funny... because these are for you. Oh. Your dance number was spectacular. You were the one who made it all a coherent story. So? So? What now? Well, I guess we still have the Christmas party tomorrow. Tomorrow, what happens between us? There's something here, right? Yeah. But I go straight back to New York after the party. I just got cast in a workshop for a new show. I have to be back on set Monday in L.A., so. I guess that answers that. If only we had our own reindeer time machine. We... could have had a camp romance they'd still be telling stories about. Missed opportunity. It's probably better in the long run. Yeah, totally. Truce. Truce. Easy. Easy. Why Beckett insisted you glue on fake eyebrows to match the beard is beyond me. I don't know. He said it was authentic, or method, or some sort of actor word. Here we go. Okay. So... Did you talk to Peyton yet? No. I haven't had the chance, but I have given it a lot more thought. Long distance didn't work then and it won't work now. But I'm going to show her I'm serious this time. I want to find an apartment in Portland. Look at you, all grown up. All right, back to work, doctor. Save my eyebrow. I don't know... Peyton, great news! I found the perfect writer. Annette Doyle. She did that book on all those Amish farms. Peyton, you there? Yeah. So... I... I really can't write it? I just think you're too green. But Doyle will be great, and I'll include you in all the meetings, every step. You can show her your journals. You there? Yeah. Mona, I'm sorry, but I... I can't work for you anymore. I quit. There you are. I was looking for you everywhere. You disappeared after the show. The book is a no. Mona's only interested if there's another writer attached. That makes no sense. Well, it does in a way. She doesn't want to take a risk, and I'm a risk. Maybe she just knows I'm not cut out to be a writer. Hey, hey. Let's get some food, and maybe a hot chocolate? Let's talk about all this. I... I can't. I'm headed to my parents' place to tell them that I'm ready to take over the camp. What? Well, it makes the most sense. I love it here, and it's my family's legacy. But you want to be a writer, you always have. Yeah, well... you of all people should know that sometimes things don't work out the way we want them to. I don't understand. Did... Did I do something wrong? I thought we were going to talk about the kiss? I'll save you the trouble. We got caught up in the moment, you know, I get it. We were always just a camp fling and not meant to exist in the real world. I gotta go. Well, I thought you two would be non-stop smiling after my decision last night. At first, I was elated, but then your father reminded me that, ever since you were a little girl, you had a dream... But that dream is not to take over this place, it's to be a writer, to live in the big city, to have a life of your own. Yeah, but, Mom, it's just... It's not working out for me. It's a sign. Besides, you guys know that I... I love it here. It's home. Yes, it is home, but it's also all-consuming. Between the remoteness, and struggling to make it an event space during the winter, it's endless hours, and I know, deep down inside, you don't want to have to deal with all of that, you never did, but that's okay. Especially since the reason that we're retiring is we just can't do it anymore. Then what is going to happen to all this? We got an offer on the land. We're going to take it. What? The buyer wants to turn this entire place into a destination Christmas-tree farm. Wow! That actually... Well, that seems very fitting. I think your great-grandmother would approve. Yeah. I just can't go back to being Mona's assistant again. So don't. You'll find a new path... Your path. Hey, Kelly. I don't know if you heard. No, I know you quit. I overheard Mona talking about it with Steve. Yeah. I'm so sorry I didn't give you a heads-up. It was all a bit... Bit spur of the moment. I get it. I'm calling because I overheard Mona saying that the reason she kept turning down your manuscripts was because she didn't want to lose you as an assistant. What? Wait, really? Yeah. I thought you should know, and because I loved your camp pitch, and your Shanghai Tunnel manuscript... I couldn't put it down. Don't give up. Oh... thank you, Kelly. That means a lot. Coffee when you get back in town? Yes. My treat. Okay. Oh, thank you. I can't believe this is the last Christmas in July party. I know. I hate endings. Me too. But maybe endings are just a chance for new beginnings. Are you breaking into song? If it would help with what I'm about to say next, - then maybe I should. - Please don't. I didn't mean what I said the other night. I was just afraid of rejection. I think we should date. You know, at least go on a date. I really want to try. I like you. A lot. Probably too much. I like you. A lot. Probably too much. I'd love to go on a date with you, maybe two or three. Okay. Finding love at camp. Who woulda thought? I miss that. I miss us. Hey... what if we took a step back from our company? Not permanently, but hired someone to do the day to day? Maybe... so we could start a family? Really? So you're not afraid anymore? Oh, no, I'm terrified... Absolutely terrified... It's like I'm the world's tallest ladder. Oh! As long as we're together, that's the only thing that matters. It looks like you two are enjoying the party. Yeah. Oh, hey, I almost forgot. This is for you. - Who's it from? - Thomas. Oh. Wait, did you guys already talk? Yeah. Yeah, we... we talked. So? You're going to make it work? What? No. I heard you backstage yesterday. I know he doesn't think long distance is going to work. Right. That's why he's looking at apartments in Portland. What? I think you should open the envelope. - First date. - First date. Why didn't you tell me you were looking for apartments to rent in Portland? I didn't get the chance. That's quite a commitment. Losing my father taught me that you can't take things for granted. If you have love... hold on to it, as tight as you can. And what we had was love. Beckett... Ooh! I love it. I love you. Okay, Thomas's turn. I thought we said nothing big. Well, it's just... It's a little something. It's done? It's just a mock-up. It doesn't officially come out until July, but, you know, I wanted you to have the first copy. You used my drawing! Yeah, of course, I did. Pass it around! Oh, that's so pretty. I got a little something for you, too. I thought we weren't supposed to do any... Oh-oh. Spend all your Christmases with me? Forever? Yes! - Yes? - Yes!
