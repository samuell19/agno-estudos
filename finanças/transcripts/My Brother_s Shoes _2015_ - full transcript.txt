(beeping) (gentle instrumental music) (energetic instrumental music) (ice clinking) - Hey Dallas. Did you see the email? - Yeah, I just read it. - I can't believe we're just now hearing about this. - Well, you gotta love our clients. - I guess that means we're all working late tonight. - No, Mitch, there's no need for you to stay over. I can handle it. You go home. - Are you sure? - Get out of here before I change my mind. I can just go over the presentation with you in the morning before the client gets here. - I love you, boss. - Go on. (energetic instrumental music) - Austin, I said Manhattan up. This is on the rocks. - Sorry. - Are you sure you're okay? You really don't seem to be very focused. - I don't know. I'm just not in a great mood tonight. I just feel depressed all the time. - Tell mama. - It's just the same old thing every day. My life is going nowhere. I'm going nowhere. I just don't see any light at the end of the tunnel. - What about moving to a new apartment? I mean, you're right. Your place is depressing. - I can't afford a new place. I can barely pay rent on the one I've got now. - But you make good money here. Don't tell me you don't. I see you shakin' your little money maker over there, getting your tip jar over flowing. What are you spending it on? - Rent, gym, student loans, credit card bills. Oh, and let's not forget my most recent expense, the entry fee for the upcoming Ms. Glam Diva Contest. That alone was 350 bucks. - Oh, that's right, I almost forgot about that. That's tomorrow night. What's the prize for first place this year? - $5,000. - $5,000, there you go. That's your ticket out of here. Win that and your troubles are over. - And that's easier said than done. You must be forgetting I am the one who has entered that contest for three years straight now. - Oh, that word. - Okay, sorry, three years in a row now. - Thank you very much. - And I have yet to even place. Not runner up, not honorable mention. Not even a Miss Congeniality. - But you have me this year. We're going shopping. We'll get you a whole new look. You'll look fierce. What's the drag name you're going to go by this year? - The same one I use every year, Helen Blazes. - Oh no, honey. We have to change that too. - What's wrong with Helen Blazes? That's a great drag name. - This is from a man whose own parents named their two sons after cities in Texas? Dallas and Austin? So what do you know about good names? - Like what? What do you think is a good name? - Virginia Ham, Kitty Litter, Anita Martini, Mary Wanna, Chan D'Leer. - Helen Blazes. - Helen Blazes. Oh no, no way. - I'm sticking to the name. I've used it in the past and I'm using it again. I have a following. - Oh, you have a following? Okay, Helen, okay. But we have got to get you a new ensemble to wear. - And that takes money. Money I don't have. - What about your brother Dallas? He's doing well. He can help out. - Are you kidding me? I already owe him money from the last couple of times I asked him for help. He's not gonna help me again. - Well, it doesn't hurt to ask. We need to get you a new outfit for the contest. Don't you want to win? (fingers snapping) Uh, no. You are not snapping your fingers at me. - I think they want their drinks. - Oh, you think? Snapping your fingers is not going to get me to come over there any faster. - [Customer] Oh yeah, what will? - Talk to my left honey, because you ain't right. This conversation is not over. I'll be right back. In the meantime, call your damn brother. - Oh, what the hell. (keys clicking) (phone ringing) - Hello Austin. Look, I can't talk a lot right now. I'm here at the office. Yeah, I gotta work late. It's a big project, an ad campaign that I have to finish for a presentation tomorrow. I'm trying to get it done and get out of here, so keep it short. - Well, maybe I can help. Is it a fashion ad? Underwear ad? Swimwear campaign? - Now what would you know about fashion? - Oh, come on, I'm gay. It's what my people do. We are born with the natural ability to accessorize and beautify. It's kind of like your natural ability to fix a car engine or scratch your balls. - (laughing) I don't know how to fix a car engine, and leave my balls out of the conversation, okay? But you, fashion, style? Come on, you wouldn't know how to layout a fashion ad if your life depended on it. Hell, I've seen how you dress. - It's funny you should mention dress and fashion. It's kind of the reason I called. - Why would you call me about that? - I need you to do me a favor. - Which translates into I need you to loan me some money, which translates into again, which translates into it's really not a loan because I will never pay you back. Am I right? - No, I will pay you back this time, I promise. What's it for? What is it for? What's it for? It's for, it's for a new gown. - What? Are you fucking kidding me? That's important? - You don't understand. I entered the Ms. Glam Diva Contest tomorrow night and I have to win and first prize is $5,000 and I need that money to pay you back and I waited to the last minute to get ready and if you don't help me out, there is no way I am going to win. Hello? - I do not believe that you are asking me for money so that you can buy a dress. Okay, a gown, whatever. You're really something. You're a piece of work. - No, but this is an emergency. I want to win that contest. Do you know how many times I've tried? Wait, of course you wouldn't. You've never come to one of my shows or one of my fundraisers or one of my events or anything that I've been proud to be a part of, huh? - God, here we go again. God, you sound just like my wife. Austin, I really don't have time for this. I gotta get back to work and home to Katelyn. She's been acting weird tonight too. Something's up with her. - Please, please, please, just loan me the money just this one more time and I will never ask you again. - No, that's it. - I swear to you this is the last favor ever. You said you would do anything for me, right? Well, please do this for me. Please. - No! Goodbye brother. (sighing) - Hello? Hello? - Good news, I take it? - I love my brother but sometimes he just makes me so mad. I mean he doesn't get it. He doesn't understand what's important in life. All our lives, as we were growing up, everything came so easy to Dallas. Everything he touched turned to gold. - Oh, stop, you're breaking my heart. Like your life has been so bad? - Well, not tonight. I'm sick of being alone. If I can't get the money than screw it. I might as well go out and have a good time. - Uh-oh. - There's a whole world of men out there who would be happy to be with me. It's like a whole big forest of men. And I am ready with my axe to chop down the first tree I see, baby. - All of this because your brother said no to a loan. - Screw my brother. - Okay, I'll screw him I've seen him, he's hot. - If he doesn't understand me, then might as well go out and have the crazy life he's always thought I had. He thinks being gay means I have sex all the time. We don't have to deal with women and their emotions and needs. He thinks I have no worries. No serious problems. He thinks I have a great life. - You're starting to scare me. - Jackie, I'll see you in the morning. But if my apartment is a-rockin', then don't come a-knockin'. I'm headed home early. I'll leave your tab open if you want. Jackie will take care of you if you need anything else. - Nah, that's okay. You can close me out. How much do I owe you? - The same as last night. The same as last week. The same as last month. You always come in here, you always have one drink, it is always the same drink, and it always costs the same. Wow. Did I just say that? I'm sorry. - It's quite all right. I know you're having a hard time. I couldn't help but overhear some of your troubles on the phone. - Well, that's life, or I should say well, that's my life. My brother has no clue how lucky he is. - Too bad. Maybe I can help you. - Oh, are you my knight in shining armor? Are you going to pay for my gown? - (chuckles) No, I wish I could. But I might have something that could help you. This has always brought me good luck. Maybe it'll do the same for you. (mysterious instrumental music) - Well, that's the first time he's left me a tip. Maybe my luck is changing. - So sorry I'm so late. - It doesn't matter. You're home now. - You wouldn't believe the work I have to put in to get this presentation ready for tomorrow. I don't know what I was thinking when I told Mitch he could go home. - That's nice, sweetie. But you're here. - I mean, I don't know how much help he could have been. I'm the one who is really doing all the work. And I'm the one the client likes. - Sweetie, I ... - I mean, the client only deals with me. But that may change tomorrow. He's really been disappointed. - Dallas, stop. - I'm sorry, honey, I'm just really tired. I think I'm gonna go downstairs and have a drink and unwind. Maybe a hot shower. - Can you hang on for just one minute? I've been waiting up all night for you to get home. I just need to talk to you about something. - Katelyn, I'm so tired right now. Can't it wait? Whatever it is you want to do is fine with me. I'm sure you can handle whatever it is on your own. You've always had that special magic. - Um, actually, for this magic trick, I am going to need my beautiful assistant. - What are you talking about? - Well, according to Dr. Bales, my obstetrician, tomorrow night is the perfect time for us to conceive. I'm my most fertile. - Wow, are you sure? - Well, I'm not but Dr. Bales is. - Well, I'd much rather deal with you than Dr. Bales. - So this is it. We are going to have a baby. Finally. - Katelyn? - What? - Don't get too excited. I don't want you to get your hopes up if it doesn't work. You know this will be the third time to try. - And third time's the charm. - I just want to make sure that you're prepared for three strikes you're out. - I can't believe you're saying this. It's gonna work this time. I can feel it. - Yes, I'm sure you feel confident but you were so confident last time and the time before. I just don't want to see you get depressed again like last time. I just don't want to see you that way. - Stop. Stop talking about the other times. This will work. - But if it doesn't work, Dr. Bales mentioned some other options last time that we may want to consider. It could be me. Maybe we just weren't meant to ... - Stop it. Don't talk like that. It will work. If you keep talking about it you'll jinx it. I don't want to hear about other times or other options. This will work. It will work. - Of course it will. Of course it will. - Please, let's just not talk about it. Tomorrow night. It will be great. Talking about it will only jinx it. - Okay, we won't talk about it. - Or we'll jinx it. - Or we'll jinx it. (gentle instrumental music) Are you sure we have to wait until tomorrow night? - Yes. Cool your jets, Tiger. Save it up for tomorrow night. - Not even a sample? - No (laughs), tomorrow night. - All right, well, I'm going go down stairs and have that drink and take a long hot shower. Looks like I'll need it since it's only going to be sleeping time for me tonight, right? You want anything? - No, I'm fine. Just save your strength for tomorrow night. (street sounds) (panting) (sighing) - I need a break. (sighing) - You want a cigarette? - You got one? - No, I don't smoke. - Then why did you offer? - Just, just trying to be helpful. Something I can do to help? - No, I'm fine, just give me a moment. - You want me to get on top? - What? Hell, no. I'm no fucking bottom. - Just trying to be helpful. - I was there that night. You did a great job. You should have won. - Thanks - You looked really hot up there on stage. - Um, okay. - I have a confession to make. - You want me to put on my priest's outfit? Would that get you hot? - Ever since I saw you that night, I've been trying to track you down. - Should I be worried? - I wasn't sure what you looked like out of drag so I asked around and someone told me that you worked at Shelby's. So I went in there a couple of times and saw you working behind the bar. - I don't remember seeing you there. - Well, I didn't sit at the bar. I sat at a table. I was too nervous to say hi to you. - Now, now, shyness is not an attractive feature for you. Wow, I think this is a first. I've never had my very own stalker. - Well, I was worried that you were with that waiter. You know, the one you're always talking to and laughing with. - Who, Jackie? (laughing) Ewww. No, we're close but not that close. We're more like sisters. And I could never find my sister attractive. But Lord help the mister who comes between me and my sister. - I couldn't imagine my luck tonight when you walked into The White Swallow. I was ready to leave and then you came in. There you were. You were all alone. I couldn't believe it was you. I was ready to rape you right then and there. I just, well, I'm ready to go again. (breathing heavily) (grunting) - What are you doing? What are you looking at? - Nothing. Austin? - Yes? - Will you do something for me? - Anything, I'll do anything. - Will you put the wig on for me? - What? - What? Just for a second. - Are you fucking kidding me? - Come on, please. I'm so close. - Oh, my God. Get out. GET OUT!! - What the fuck's your problem? - My problem? What's my problem? Well, I thought you found me attractive. I thought you wanted to make out with me. I thought you wanted to be with me. - I did. I do. - No, you don't. You didn't want to be with me. You wanted to be with Helen Blazes. You thought she would be here. - That's not it exactly. I thought you were cute. I wanted to get to know you. - You wanted to get to know me? - Yeah. - So should I put this on so you can get to know me? Would that make you hot? Would that turn you on? Would that make you finally shoot your load? - Would you do that for me? - Get out. Go find some chick with a dick because there's not one to be found here. Maybe then you can finally get off. Because obviously you have some problems in that department. - Fuck you. I don't need you analyzing me. I have no problem getting off. The problem is you. Right, you're one fucked up individual. - I'm sorry. Don't go. I don't want to be alone tonight. - No, you need to be alone tonight. I don't like whoever you are. - Don't go, please. Please stay. - If Helen comes to town, have her give me a call, okay? 'Cause whoever you are, me no like. - But there is no Helen. There is only me. (door slams) Only me. Only me. (sound of shower running) (phone ringing) - Honey, your brother's on the phone. - Hey, will you grab that for me? Tell him I'll be right there. - Austin? Hey, it's Katelyn. How are you? Are you okay? Dallas is just getting out of the shower. It will be a minute. Can you hang on? Oh, I'm fine. When are we going to see you again? It's been too long. He sounds upset. Austin? Dallas just got out of the shower. Here he is. - Hey, what's up with the two calls in one night? - Dallas, would you do me a favor? Would you and Katelyn come see my competition? I know you're not really comfortable with that sort of thing but it would mean a lot to me. - Wow, um. - Nevermind, no. Forget it. No, I didn't think you would accept but I thought I would just ask. I mean it would mean a lot to me, but I get it. I understand, it's asking too much. - Now wait a minute. I didn't say no. I just have to think about it. When is it? - Really? You would come? Dallas, that would mean so much to me. You'd really do that for me? Are you sure you're okay with that? Are you sure? - Sure, if it means that much to you, Katelyn and I would love to come see you in your show. When is it? Tomorrow night? Oh, yeah, tomorrow night. I'm not sure what we have planned. - You can't do anything tomorrow night. You're with me making a baby. You have to tell him no. - Okay, okay, I'll tell him. I'm sure he'll understand if I just explain to him what's going on with us. - No, you promised me not to tell anyone. We weren't gonna talk about it. It's between us. - Not even my brother? - No, you'll jinx it. - But this is my brother. I can tell him what's going on, can't I? - No, please. Promise me. - Hey, uh, Austin? Yeah, I can't come to your show. I'm sorry. Katelyn just reminded me that we have plans. - Just like that? Suddenly you, you have plans? Is that really it? Is it plans or is it just cold feet? - Cold feet? What is that supposed to mean? I told you we have plans. No, I don't have a problem with going to some event of yours. You know that. I would do anything for you. I just can't come to your show. - Don't worry about it. You'd do anything for me? Really? Wow. What a joke. You know, I don't need you there. I don't need your money. I don't need your support. I don't need anybody. Okay, I can do this all on my own. - Hello? Hello? Well, that went well. - I'm sorry, but thank you. It means a lot to me. - But this meant a lot to Austin. Now he thinks I have a problem with him being gay. - Honey? - Yeah? - I've never asked you this before. Do you? - Do I what? - Do you have a problem with Austin being gay? - Do you mean do I care that my only sibling runs around dressing like a woman part time and sleeping with men full time? No, I'm thrilled. - So you have a problem? - What guy wants to have a gay brother? I mean, I didn't wish it. When Mom and Dad presented me with a baby brother, I didn't look down at the baby and go &quot;Oh, boy, I hope he turns out to be gay.&quot; But I accepted it. I've learned to accept it. - So do you wish he were straight? - Yeah, no, I don't know. He is what he is. I don't want to talk about it. - Honey, I'm sorry. Thank you for keeping our secret. I love you so much. No, save it for tomorrow night. I want your little soldiers well rested and ready for action. - I think I'll go take another shower. This time a cold one. (gentle instrumental music) (door knocking) - Come in. - Hey. - Hey. - Don't tell me you're just getting up? - Heck, I'm almost ready. - So, did you have a nice night last night? I don't see any used condoms on the floor. Did you play safe or did you not play at all? - Listen, I don't want to talk about it. How was the bar after I left? - Oh. Oh, it quieted down. You didn't miss a thing. Where should we start with first? - Start with what? - Shopping, come on. We have to get going if we're going to find you the right outfit for tonight. - Oh, shit, I totally forgot that was tonight. Hang on. Damn it. I don't have any cash and my credit cards are all maxed out. Can you loan me ... - Neither a borrower nor a lender be. Besides, you still haven't paid me back the last time. - When did I ever put the bite on you? - Honey, you've bitten me so many times, I should be sleeping in a coffin during the day. - Wait. Wait, I know where I can get some money. I left the tip jar down at the bar last night. It should still be there. That is unless you touched it. - Would I steal from my sister? Never, I promise. - Well, let's get down there before somebody realizes that I left it there. (suspenseful music) - Ugh, this place smells like a sweaty men's locker room. Do they ever clean it? - Now don't start getting all turned on. We have work to do. - I'm going to go tinkle. I'll be right back. - Don't forget to put the toilet seat down before you sit. - [Jackie] Oh, my God, you are so funny. - I am. (playful music) (phone beeping) (sighing) Damn it. (phone beeping) (sighing) He's always had everything so damn easy. He has no idea what it's like to struggle and get nowhere. He has no idea. (coins clinking) - What is his problem? Why is he being so needy? Doesn't he know how complicated my life is? - I wish he could just see what it's like to be me for one day. - He has no clue about my life. You know, he should be me for a day. (coin rattling) (suspenseful music) - Honey, are you all right? (suspenseful instrumental music) Are you okay? Are you okay? Let me get you some water. - Good morning, Dallas. Great job on these layouts. The client's going to love it. We're all set for the one o'clock presentation. I took the liberty of calling his assistant to confirm the time. I'll let you know when I hear back, but we should be all set. - What? - Wow, you look terrible. You must have really pulled an all nighter. I'll go and get you some coffee. - Coffee, no, I, I. - All right, suit yourself, but you could really use an energy drink or a power bar or something. You pull yourself together. I'll get going on the final spreadsheets and then we should be set. Maybe you should put your head down on your desk and try to get a couple of winks. - Yeah, I need to rest. I need to think. - Oh, and Dallas? Once again. Great job. I can't wait to show the client the layouts. This should go great. (fantasy instrumental music) Are you all right? Dallas? - I'm fine. - Okay, I'll see you at one. - What the hell is going on? - What did you have to drink last night? Maybe you should put your head down. - What? - Put your head down. Head down. You know, like you did for your little date last night. - Date? What are you talking about? - Call it what you like but you look awful. If you were flying right now, you'd have to pay extra for your oversized bags. Look at yourself. (eerie music) (chair squeaking) (phone ringing) (suspenseful music) - Hello? Dallas? Where are you? I think I am in your office. - Something really weird is happening here. I don't know how I got here. Do you have any memory of going to my office this morning? - This is definitely your office. There's a picture of your wife on the desk. Hope it's your office or Katelyn has some 'splainin' to do. - All right, Austin, here's what I need you to do. I need you to go over to my office door and shut it and lock it. Well, if it's, if it's already shut then just lock it. I'm coming over. Stay there. I'll be there in ten minutes. Don't open the door. Don't talk to anyone. Is that clear? - Lock the door. Don't talk to anyone. But I don't get it. Why? What's going on? Why do you sound so mad? You're really freakin' me out. Just tell me what's going on. - There's a plaque on the wall near my desk. It's really a mirror. Go over there and look at it. - All right, I'm walking over to the plaque. (screaming) (phone hang up) - Christ. I need to use your car. Do you have one? - Do I have a car? You know I do. How do you think we got here? - Great, I need to borrow it. Uh, I'm sorry, what's your name? - What's my name? Did you hit your head on the way down to the floor? Don't you know who I am? - I'm sorry I don't, but I need your car. I have to get to my office. - What office? Honey, I think we need to get you a doctor. Maybe you've got amnesia or something. - Look, look, I don't need a doctor. I just need your car. - Okay, okay, but you just let Miss Jackie drive you because you're in no condition to do so. - Fine, go get Miss Jackie and we'll go. - Are you kidding me? Come on, I'm driving, Miss Daisy. Just tell me where the hell your office is. - I thought you said her name was Jackie. - Never mind. Don't forget your tips. Oh, what the hell. - I'm frightened, Auntie Em. I'm frightened. (buzzer ringing) - Mr. Trent? Your brother Austin and a friend of his are here to see you. Mr. Trent? - Yes, yes, I'm here. Send them in. Hello? (playful music) - Unlock the door. - Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. What is happening? - Just relax. Calm down. We will figure this out, just relax, okay? (yelping) - Oh my God, oh my God. - Just calm down. Hold on. Breathe, little brother, breathe. - I don't get it. I wake up here in your office. I have no idea how I got here. I look in this mirror and I see you instead of me. - And I look and I see you instead of me. - And I look and I and see two crazy bitches. What are you guys going on about? Look, you're both fine. I see Dallas and I see Austin. And here I see Dallas and I see Austin. - But I'm not Dallas, I'm Austin. - And I'm not Austin, I'm Dallas. - And I'm not Jackie, I'm gorgeous. What crazy game are we playing? - Seriously? You don't see anything wrong with what you see standing in front of you and what you see in the reflection? - No, sorry. - But I'm Austin, I'm Austin. Why can't you see that? (door knocking) - Just a minute. Hey, what's up? - Oh, hi, I don't think we've met before. I'm Mitch. You must be Dallas' brother. - Mitch, what are you doing? I know who you are. - We've met before? - Met before? - Oh, you are? - Confused. Sorry, honey, Jackie. My name's Jackie. Or is it? - Yes, you're Jackie. - Yes, you're Jackie. - [Mitch] Nice to meet you. - Nice is not what I have on my mind. - Dallas, the assistant just called to confirm the one o'clock meeting. We're all set. Are you feeling better? - Um, meeting? - Yes, we're all set. - Yes, we're all set. All set for the meeting thingy with the client person. - We were just discussing it. Could you leave us alone for a minute? We're having a family meeting right now and we need to finish up. - Sure, I didn't mean to interrupt. It was nice meeting you. Dallas, I'll see you at one. - Oooh, child, he is fine. - Tell me about it. - All right, you guys. Will you be serious for a minute. Meeting thingy? Client person? What the hell was that? - Why are you yelling at me? - Don't you get it? Mitch looks at you and he sees me. Mitch looks at me and he sees you. - Mitch looks at me and he sees heaven. What is the problem? Why do you two go on and on about this? What is the issue here? - For some reason, Austin and I have switched places. - Switched places? Austin, what are you talking about. - Stop calling me that. I'm not Austin. I'm Dallas. - And that's Austin? Not Dallas? - Correct. - Say what? What? Is this some kind of joke? - He's not joking. I'm Austin and that's Dallas. - Okay, let me get this straight. And you know how much I hate getting anything straight. You look like Dallas but you're really Austin on the inside and you look like Austin but you're really Dallas on the inside. Dallas, Austin, Austin, Dallas. Oh, Lordy! Pilot, let me know when we land in Ft. Worth. - I'm Austin. I know, I know, I can prove it. Come here. (playful music) - That doesn't prove a thing. That's public knowledge. It's written down clearly on the third stall of any public men's room in my own handwriting. - Oh, yeah? Well, I bet this isn't written anywhere. - Okay, you're Austin. - Now you believe me? - What'd you tell him? - Well, I just reminded him ... - Don't you dare. - I won't, I won't. Calm down. Well, he now believes us. That's the important part. - Which is more than I can say for the rest of the world. Oh, shit. I've got that meeting coming up at one o'clock. Okay, this is going to sound crazy but you're going to have to cover for me at the meeting. - What, me? - Yes. If I go they're not going to recognize me. But if you go, they'll believe you are me. - Oh, my God. Here we go again. - Look, if you don't do this, I could lose the account. - But if I do do this, you will lose the account. I don't know anything about the client, the meeting, what to say. - You don't have to know anything. Just let Mitch do all the talking. Okay, he knows everything about the account and the client. - Mitch, the cute guy? - I don't know if he's cute. Jesus, the guy that was just in here. - Oh, he's cute. - Will you stay out of this? So you just go to the meeting with Mitch at one o'clock. He'll come and get you. Tell him you feel it would be best if he took charge of the meeting. Believe me, that will make Mitch very happy. He's been dying to show me up. Then just sit back and let Mitch do all the work. - This sounds just like &quot;All About Eve&quot; except Mitch is the backstabbing Eve and you are ... - Do you mind staying out of this for just a minute? - So what do I do until the meeting? - Just sit right here and look busy. And keep the door closed. Now if anyone comes in and asks you about something, just turn it back on them by asking what they think. It works every time. - Okay, sounds easy enough. - So you think you can handle it? - Do you think I can handle it? - Very good, now that's the way to run an office. - Works for me. - Children, I hate to break up a game of let's play house, but there's something that you seem to be forgetting. - What's that? - Someone in this room has a Ms. Glam Diva Contest to get ready for. - Oh, my God, that's tonight. What am I going to do? (playful instrumental music) - Oh, no, absolutely not. - Come on. You don't actually have to do the contest. You just have to go out and get ready. I'm sure this whole thing is going to go back to normal before tonight. - What do you mean go out and get ready? - Shopping, new dress, new shoes. - I don't know anything about women's clothes. - It will be easy. Jackie will do everything for you. You just have to be there to try things on. If anyone asks you about anything, just turn around on them by asking what they think. It works every time. - That's not funny. - Don't worry, honey. I'll help you every step of the way. You'll be my Liza Doolittle and I'll be your Professor Higgins. - No, I won't do it. I draw the line at wearing women's wear. - Too bad. Looks like that one o'clock meeting isn't going to happen either. - But it's got to happen. If you don't do this for me, I could lose my livelihood, my whole career, my company. - Well? - If I do this, do I actually have to go on stage? I don't have to, right? - I'm sure this whole nightmare will be over way before then. - And all I have to do is get ready? Not perform? - You do that for me and I will represent you at the one o'clock meeting. - What choice do I have? - Exactly. - Okay, let's go shopping. - I'll be right there. What are you doing? You know your brother can't do this? - I know. - He can't represent you. You'll lose for sure. - I know. - Then why are you making him go through with this? - I just want him to see what it's like to be me. I want him to realize how tough I've got it. Take him out shopping. Get him ready for the contest. And when the time comes, and if we have not switched back to our normal selves, I want you to go out on the runway for me. - You want me to be Helen Blazes? - You can be whomever you like. Just take my place. Let Dallas off the hook at the last minute, but make him squirm a little before you do. He always said he would do anything for me. Well, I just want to see how far he'll go. (exciting instrumental music) (suspenseful music) (exciting instrumental music) (suspenseful music) (elegant instrumental music) (suspenseful music) (elegant instrumental music) (suspenseful music) (elegant instrumental music) (suspenseful music) (upbeat dance music) (Vegas show music) (exciting instrumental music) (suspenseful music) (exciting instrumental music) - Okay, I think we've got everything we need. Ready to go, Tiger? - (Chuckles) Funny. - What's funny? - It's what my wife calls me. &quot;Tiger&quot;. - You don't have a, oh wait, I guess you do. - Yes, I do. At least I think I still do. - What's her name? - Katelyn. - Katelyn. That's a pretty name. I bet she's pretty too. Just like her name. - How about you? Have anyone special? Oh, uh, you and my brother? - (laughing) Oh, hell no. - Okay, okay, I didn't know. - Don't you and your brother ever talk? - Sure we talk. But I don't ask a lot of questions. I mean, he has his life. I have mine. - Well, your brother doesn't have much of a life. - Really? - Look around you. This is pretty much it. This and work. - So you mean he doesn't have a friend. - Do you mean a boyfriend? - I guess so. - You don't really talk, do you? - I guess not. - No, Austin is quite alone. He doesn't seem to have much luck when it comes to the fellas. I don't get it. I mean, you are, he is cute. But love just doesn't seem to be in the cards for Austin. - I didn't know. - There is one thing he does have. - What's that? - You, for a brother. - Well, he's always had me. We're family. - But look at what you're doing for him. - Well, I'm just covering for him until this weird thing wears off. Well, until it gets back to where we were. - No, you're doing more than that. I wish I had someone like you in my life. - Don't you have family? - Family? Nah, I'm an only child. I have no concept of what it's like to have an older brother looking out for me. I used to pretend I did, but pretending and having are two different things. - But you had the love of your parents. - I might have had the love of my mother if she had only lived long enough for me to know her. But I only had my dad. There was no love lost there. - Is he still alive? - Not to me. The last time I saw my dad was at the assisted living facility where he now resides. He's not that old but he was starting to lose his memory and he couldn't live on his own. So I decided it had been awhile. Pay him a visit. I figured if he was losing his memory maybe he'd forgotten how disappointed he was in having a sissy for a son. I went in to see him and there he was, this shell of my father looking empty and old. I barely recognized him. He sure didn't seem to recognize me. We just sat there and talked for awhile. He didn't say a word. He just let me go on and on. - Yes, I've noticed you are pretty good at that. - See? You have your brother's sense of humor. So I kept talking and just rambling about different things. I was almost enjoying the fact that he didn't know me. That was the first time I had been with him where I didn't feel his anger and disgust. So I kept talking. I don't know what happened, but something I said seemed to trigger something inside of him. His eyes seemed to brighten. (gentle instrumental music) His mind seemed to clear. And he looked at me. And I knew for a moment, a brief moment, that he could see me. He even said my name. He said, &quot;Jackie&quot; And I said ... &quot;Yes, Daddy. &quot;It's me. &quot;It's me, Jackie, I'm here.&quot; And then he said the four words that every son longs to hear from their father. &quot;You got AIDS yet?&quot; I never went back there again. So, you see, I know how lucky Austin is to have you someone like you in his life. What you're doing for him is pretty amazing. Okay, (laughing) that's enough drama. I gotta get this stuff down to the car. It's getting late. (door slams) (horn honking) (phone ringing) - Hello? - [Katelyn] Hey, Tiger. - Hello, who is this? - Very funny. How'd your presentation go? - Presentation? - Dallas, honey, are you okay? - Katelyn, is that you? - Yes, of course, it's me. What time are you coming home? Are you sure you're okay? You don't sound like yourself. - I don't? Don't be ridiculous. Who else would I be? I mean, of course, I'm Dallas, er, me. This is me. Me is who I am. - You sound different. You're talking differently. - Really, I am? (in a deeper voice) Really, I am? I don't know what you mean. - Okay, Tiger. I don't know what game you're playing but I want you home promptly at seven. All will be prepped and ready for you. Got it? - Um, got it, seven o'clock. I'll see you then, Tiger. - What? (Gentle instrumental music) - Uh,um, Tigress? Honey? Love Muffin? - I don't what's wrong with you, but you'd better be home on time. - Got it. Um, I'll see you then, Pumpkin. Um, sweetie, Angel Puss? (suspenseful music) (phone ringing) (phone vibrating) - Hello? - Where's Dallas? I need to talk to him. I've been trying to reach him on my phone. - First of all, calm down. Second of all, we don't have your phone. We probably left it at your place. Your brother's not here. He's in the powder room. I think he's throwing up. He's really getting nervous. - But I really need to talk to him. - What's your problem? - It's Katelyn, his wife. She's expecting me home, or she's expecting Dallas home. I don't think that I can cover for him. She's gonna know something's different. - Oh, my God, honey. Is that all? Just go to her house. I'm sure she has a nice dinner all prepped and ready for you. How can you mess that up? Just butch it up. You'll be fine. I have much bigger things to worry about. - So how was Dallas today? Does he still think he's going on? - Yes, I haven't told him yet. - Okay, I'll tell you what. I'll go get Katelyn and bring her to the show. Dallas said they had plans but surely a dinner can be postponed. I'll bring her to the show tonight and then you and I can tell Dallas together that you are going on for him instead. Do not tell him until I get there and don't tell him I'm coming. - You are really turning into a catty little bitch. I am so glad we're friends. - Well, who says we are? Okay, well, I'll talk to you later. - Feeling better? - Maybe a little bit. And then again, maybe not. I don't get it. I thought this whole thing would be over by now. I thought things would return to normal. What if it doesn't? What if I have to be a queer the rest of my life? - First of all, you are not allowed to say that word. - I'm sorry, I'm just upset. What if I really do have to go out there? Jackie, I don't know if I can. I don't know if I can do this. - Dallas, you've done so much for Austin. He really doesn't deserve it. You're amazing. I wish I had someone like you in my life. - He's my brother. We're family. I'd do anything for him. I just never thought it would be something like this. - Austin doesn't deserve this. (gentle instrumental music) You need to know something about your wonderful brother. - I don't care what you say about him. We're family. I know he'd do this for me. Probably even do more. - Oh, really? I wouldn't be so sure. Dallas, I want you to know something. Tonight, when it's time for you to go out on stage. - Oops, sorry to interrupt. Now which one of you is Helen Blazes? - That would be her. - Yeah, I guess that's me. - Love the name. Now, listen, we've got to get a move on. You've got to fill these forms out, sign you up. - I'll go. Helen has a bit of the butterflies right now. She needs her rest. - Fine with me. I just need somebody to fill these forms out. Come on, girl. - Well, I'd had better get my queer ass out of here and get us signed up. I'll be right back. - Hey, I thought it was bad to call someone &quot;queer&quot;. - Oh, no, honey. We can do it to each other. Queer, queen, homo. - Faggot. - Pansy. - Fudge packer. - Fruit. - Tranny. - Sodomite. - Panty waist. - Fairy. - Sissy! - Well, you get the picture. All of those are okay to say if you're a part of our sorority. You have to be a sister. We can say it. You cannot. Get it? - It's all very confusing. - Well, don't let it bother you. I'll be back. Don't go anywhere. - Muffin? Sugar plum? Lucy, I'm home. Katelyn? Are you okay? (sighing) (sensual music) - Hey, handsome. - Hey, beautiful. - Oh, honey. I didn't think you would ever come home. I've been waiting forever to get started. Do you like what I'm wearing? - Oh, yes. Oh, it's fabulous. Where did you get it? At Saks, Macy's? Oh, I love the color. Does it come in other shades? - Stop teasing me. If you don't like it, I can just take it off. - Ah, no! - Aw, honey. I didn't think I would ever have a chance to get you alone. Look, I've been waiting forever to tell you I'm sorry for the way I acted. Do you like what I'm wearing? I like what you're wearing. - I think you have me mistaken for someone else, buddy. - Oh, no, Helen. I know just who you are. You look hot. - Helen? Oh, wait. I'm not a woman. This is a wig, see? I'm a dude. - No. Put it back on. It really gets me hot. - Oh, baby, what's wrong? Let me get you out of these clothes. Show Momma what you've got. - (laughing) Stop. I have to go to the bathroom. I will be right back. Oh, no (laughing). I'm not going back in there again (laughing). - Come on, baby. Let me help you get into your dress. - Stop. I have to go to the bathroom. I'll be right back. - Well, don't take too long. I'll be holding my breath 'til you get back. - Yes, you do that. You promise? (butt slap sound) (sighing) - Are you okay? Been in there a long time. - Um, yes, I'm fine. Um, just washing up. Be out there in a minute. - All right, but if not, I'm coming in there. - Nope, don't you dare. I will be right out. - Jackie? Jackie? I need your help. Where are you? Jackie? - Austin. Austin. (suspenseful music) Helen? Ah ha, I see you. Come out, come out, where ever you are. Gotcha. - You're still dressed. Well, I'll take care of that. - That's okay. I could do it. - Oh, don't be such a baby. - Do you think it's a little chilly in here? - Well, I'll get you nice and hot. - [Billy] I like it in the dark, don't you? - [Dallas] I'm not who you think I am. - [Billy] Oh, I know who you are. Come here, baby. - [Dallas] I'm warning you. Get your hands off me. - [Billy] Oh, yeah. Get rough with me, baby. That's it. Daddy likes. - [Dallas] Well, how do you like this? (fists thudding) (gentle instrumental music) (sighing) (sighing) - I got a great idea. - What's that? You wanna role play? - Is that something I like? I was thinking that tonight is my brother Austin's show and I feel bad that we're not there. So since it seems like we don't have anything planned, let's get dressed and go. I really hear he's quite good. - What are you talking about? We agreed we weren't going to go. - We did? We, we agreed that we weren't going to go see Austin's show. We agreed to that? - We agreed to that because we have more important things to take care of. - More important than supporting family? - But you are supporting your family. You're supporting your future family. Now come here. Stop all that talk. - Uh-uh. - Do I have to get rough with you? - Is that something I like? - Dallas, we only have tonight and tomorrow night. Two chances. Now come here and let's make a baby. - Oh my God. (audience clapping) - This audience is ready for a pageant, aren't you? All right, it's the Ms. Glam Diva Contest. The one hundredth year or something. I don't know. But it's a great pageant. The prize is five thousand dollars. (audience clapping) And let me tell you, nobody has waited this long for this little. But you're, you'll love it. You'll find something you like. Everybody in this audience will go home happy, especially one of these contestants. It's the Ms. Glam Diva Contest. (audience applauding) Well, it's time for the contest to begin. So, please, sit back and get ready. It's going to be a contest you'll never forget. - What are you doing dressed like that? Is everyone here crazy? Are there any normal people in this place? - What is normal? - Well, normal is not this. Did I fall down some rabbit hole? - Welcome to Wonderland, Alice. - Look, Jackie, I can't do this. I'm sorry, I just can't. - It's okay, Dallas. - No, it's not okay. I thought I could do this. I thought I could but there is a limit. - Dallas, really, everything's gonna be okay. - I've been painted. I've been dressed. I've been wigged. I've been humiliated. I've been groped and grabbed. I was almost raped. I can't do this. I thought I could. I thought that any minute this would change back. But this is becoming one nightmare that I can't wake up from. - [Jackie] Well, part of that nightmare is about to come to an end. - What are you talking about? - You don't have to go any further. You don't have to do any more. I'm going to go on for you. I signed up. I'm going to be Helen Blazes. - I don't understand. - It's pretty clear. I'm gonna go on stage and represent Austin. I'm gonna go on and take his place. Not you. - But you aren't Austin. - And neither are you. Austin figured you won't be able to go through with this, so he asked me to go on instead of you. - When did he ask you? - [Jackie] In your office this afternoon. - So he didn't think that I was going to do this for him? - Forget it. It was wrong of him to ask you to go in his place. I know you love your brother, but there's only so much you can do. There's a limit. - But I was gonna try. I was gonna do this for him. I really was. - Dallas, I know. (gentle instrumental music) You've done more for somebody than anyone else could. But it's clear you've reached your limit. - So, Austin didn't think I was going to do this for him? He didn't believe in me. - He didn't think you believed in him. So, naturally, he didn't think you could. But look at it this way. If I go on, at least Austin will have a chance of winning tonight. - But. - No more. I must go backstage and get ready to be called. I have to focus and prepare. Watch my shit. You can't trust any of the queens around here. Just let it go. It really is for the best. - (gasping) A baby? - Yes, isn't it wonderful. The family we always wanted. - Katelyn, this isn't right. I've gotta tell you something. - You can tell me anything. Anything you want. - I'm not who you think I am. - You can be whomever you want to be. Just come here. - I'm not Dallas. I'm Austin. - Oh, that's hot. Okay, okay, I know. I'll be my sister, Mollie. Oh, Austin, come to Mollie. Show me what you've got. But don't tell your brother or my sister Katelyn. You know they think you're gay. I always knew you weren't gay. Come to me, you closet breeder. - (gasping) I gotta pee. - (sighing) Again? - All right, we have five contestants tonight. It's gonna be great. Let's meet them right now. Contestant Number One. (audience applauding) Pearl Harbor. What a way to start a pageant, I tell you. This outfit, I'm sure, came from Lord and Taylor but, or Taylor and Lord. She drove forty miles to get here. Maybe she walked, I don't know, but. Go that way a little bit. There we are. Oh, dear, I'm sure you want to find out a little bit more about this contestant. I believe it's her first pageant ever. I find that hard to believe, but it is. - Really, bro? You really didn't think I'd go the distance for you? Is that how you really felt? You never believed in me? From the beginning? (gentle instrumental music) - Let's go to Contestant Number Two. Cookie Fortune. What a contrast, oh, my goodness. Cookie Fortune is our second contestant. And let me tell you, if you think that skirt is too short, you don't have legs like that (chuckling). She loves every bit of that applause. Yes, she'll take that home and put it in a little keepsake. That's Contestant Number Two. - She sees Dallas. I am Dallas. If something happens in there tonight, it is Dallas doing it. Not me. She wants a baby. She wants a baby tonight. What am I thinking? (playful instrumental music) I can't do that. That's my sister-in-law in there. What am I thinking? But I am Dallas. That's who will be going through with it. Not me. Oh, but she's a woman. I can't make out with her. I couldn't even get it up for her, let alone make a baby. But I guess Dallas could, if I truly am Dallas. Could I go that far for my brother? But, but a, but a woman. Really, oh. But Dallas likes women. Dallas likes sex with women. (gentle instrumental music) You wouldn't have a problem, would you, bro? Way to go, bro. (audience clapping) - This is an audience that knows what they like and they like what they're seeing up here tonight. Don't you, ladies and gentlemen? Okay, you're so enthusiastic. Let's see if Contestant Number Three's what your waiting for. Bring her out, Contestant Number Three. Oh, this is Chablis. It is a Ms. Glam Diva Contest. Yes. Not her first time at the rodeo. You can tell. She's walked the runway before. Just gloriously, um, she has a career ahead of her. She's got seven pageants at home but let's, lets, a little bit more for her. We promised you a contest tonight, ladies and gentlemen, and I think we have delivered. What a pageant it has been. Well, there's more. Please welcome Contestant Number Four, Crystal Balls. - Out of the way, bitch. (drums beating) (cymbals ringing) - Okay, there's not that much more but there's a little bit more there. Uh, she is really so excited to be here. She's a little nervous. Okay, don't be mean to each other. Doesn't look like a Miss Congeniality contestant there. You're next, honey. (gentle instrumental music) - [Dallas] I've got this. - [Emcee] I didn't say it was better automatically. But she does, uh, all right, there we are. She has got some hair, some feathers, and some attitude too. All right. - [Dallas] What's my name again? - Helen Blazes. - Really? - Tell me about it. Are you sure you want to do this? - [Dallas] Family. - Family. - [Emcee] It's time for our final contestant. - Ladies and Gentlemen. - I can do this. - Please welcome. - I can do this. - Contestant Number Five - I can do this. - Helen Blazes! Contestant Number Five, Helen Blazes. There she is. Our final contestant. Helen Blazes, and is she not a blazen contestant. What's with the shoes, honey? I don't think we need to see the shoes so much. It's the gown. It's all about the gown. Give us a turn there. That, uh, oh, we may have a little wardrobe malfunction there. Thank you, audience. And let's keep that encouragement going. I know how I felt trying something for the very first time. How do you do it? You've got to climb back on that horse and give it everything you've got. You've got to be at the top of your game. Just as our contestants are tonight here at this incredible pageant. Let's hear it again for Contestant Number Five, Helen Blazes. (audience clapping) Now that is a contestant that will stay in your mind for quite some time. (crowd mumbles) (coin rattling) - I can't, I can't. I'm sorry, brother. I can't do it, I just can't. This is too much. - I can't, I can't, I'm so sorry, brother. This is just too much. (coin rattling) (mysterious instrumental music) - Oh, yes, I can. - Oh, yes, you can. (gentle instrumental music) - Oh, yes, I can. (audience clapping) - [Emcee] I don't believe it. Contestant Number Five rises like the phoenix. Look at her. That's a Glam Diva right there. I think we have our winner. Judges, what do you think? I mean, after all that embarrassment. She's a trooper. Oh, unbelievable. In all the history of this pageant. Walking like the trooper she is. That is a champion. Oh, my goodness. I've never seen this. In the history of the entire pageant, that is history in the making there. You saw it. You could cut the tension with a knife. - And here's to the great news that in about nine months I'm going to be an uncle. - And a godparent if all goes right. - A godfather. And it will go right. - Wow, an uncle and godfather. It's an offer I can't refuse. (laughing) - Speaking of refusals, are you sure you won't reconsider coming to work for me? Mitch says you saved that account. - No, you saved that account. That was you in there, remember? - That's right. But the offer still stands. - No thanks. I've had enough of living in your world. I think I need to find my own world and make that work. Does Katelyn suspect that? - Why should she? Why should she? That was me in there, remember? And thank God it really was me. - So Jackie told me about all you did for me at the pageant. Sorry that I ever doubted you. And I'm sorry that I ever put you through that. I mean, you're pretty amazing. Thank you. - Well, you'd probably be thanking me if you actually won the contest or even placed. Sorry about that. - That's okay. I mean, there's always next year, right? Anyways, who needs the money? - Obviously you do. How do you intend to pay me back for all these charges you put on my credit card? - What? I ... - So that's Austin's brother, Dallas? Wow, he is hot. I wouldn't mind trading places with his wife for a night. Lucky lady. - This has always brought me good luck. Maybe it'll do the same for you. (mysterious instrumental music) (coin rattling) - Whoa, honey? Are you okay? - I don't know. I'm, I feel faint suddenly.
