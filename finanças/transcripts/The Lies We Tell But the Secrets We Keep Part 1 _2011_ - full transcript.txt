Are you serious -- this ring, thank you. Isn't it gorgeous? Cassandra: Man, I can't believe you proposed to that young-ass girl. Simone: Why not? Cassandra: Damn near half your age. Simone: So? Cassandra: She's out of your league. Netta: Man, don't trip on Cass, she just hating because she can't pull in young chicks anymore. Simone: Oh, that's what it is, huh? I knew it was something. Cassandra: Man, I'm not hating, I'm just keeping it real. Netta: Yeah, that's what it is. Simone: Well, I don't care what nobody say, I love Jess, she's my baby. And you know, luckily they say age ain't nothing but a number. Netta: I know that's right, man, shit, wish I had me a young chick. I'm tired of these old ass women coming at me. I'm going to have to take notes from you. Tre: I bet they stuck up though. Pooch: Na, I bet you I can pull them. Tre: If you can pull them, I can pull them. Pooch: Na, you'll be all sensitive. You got to be all aggressive with them. Tre: Fuck you, watch this. Hey sweetheart, can I take one of y'all home? Pooch: Hey pretty ladies. Can I go with one of y'all? Like clockwork. What up, girl, what's your name -- Lili: I'm Lili, what's yours? Pooch: Don't worry about it. I'm Pooch. Lili: Nice to meet you. Pooch: Nice to meet you. Can I take you to the show? Lili: Yeah, that would be nice. Pooch: All right, put your phone number in here. Lili: There you go. Pooch: All right, cool. All right, I'll call you later. It's too easy, man. Too easy. Tre: I don't know understand it. I call her beautiful, you call her little mama, she give you her number. Women are just simple-minded these days. Pooch: Man, stop hating. Tre: I never hate, I be pulling chicks too. Roni: What's up, y'all? Tre: What's going on, Roni? Pooch: What's good? I got something for y'all. Roni: Don't worry about all of that, just know it's for you. All right? Can't have y'all out here without no heat, you understand? Pooch: You got one too? Roni: No I don't need one. You're my soldiers tonight, so I need you to have my back, all right? Angel: Are you serious? Roni: Man, I'm dead serious. My mom didn't care. I did it anyway, she just didn't know about it. Angel: So seriously not one female could come over once she found out? Roni: Not one female, best friend or not, not one. Angel: That's crazy. I mean my family still don't know. It's better that way. Roni: I mean, but why. It means you're living your life as a lie. Angel: I mean, I won't say I'm living my life as a lie. Maybe if I was in a serious relationship and I knew we were going to be together then I'd think I'd tell my dad, seeing as me and him are closer than me and my mom. Roni: Yeah. I feel you. All right, guess what, I'm about to go to the bathroom, get this sauce off my hands. Angel: Okay. Bri: Uh huh, Lil Roni, do not play with your food. Eat it. Good? I'll be back. I've got to go to the bathroom, okay? I am so sorry. Roni? Oh my God, I missed you so much. Why didn't you tell me, I know you were so mad at me, but I loved you, baby -- why didn't you tell me? I miss you so much? I miss you. Oh -- oh my God. Tank: What the fuck, what the fuck is going on in here? Bri: I can explain, Tank. This is Roni. I told you about her, remember? Tank: I don't give a fuck who she is, get over here now, Bri. Get the fuck over here. Roni: Chill out. It ain't even like that. Chill out. Tank: You again? Look I'm tired of seeing your lame ass. Roni: I've had enough of you calling me lame. Tank: Man, hell no, what the hell is wrong with my girl, man? Roni: Man, it ain't even like that. You tripping. Tank: Yeah. Man, what the fuck are you doing with her, what the fuck are you in the bathroom doing with her? Roni: Dude, it ain't even like that, you need to chill out. Tank: No, man. Hell no. I ain't trying to hear that, hell no. Roni: Man, whatever. You need to chill out. Tank: Get your ass, come on, get the fuck out of here. Come on, we're leaving now. Get over here, Lil Roni, we're leaving now. Roni: Come on, let's go. Angel: Now? Roni: Yeah. Come on. Let's go. Tank: What the fuck was you hugging her for? Bri: Babe, I already told you the first five times that I thought she was dead, we haven't seen one another in almost two years. Tank: How did you not know she was still alive? Bri: Because when I went to visit her that's what her mother told me. Tank: And you didn't go to her funeral? Bri: No, her mother made it seem like she died and had the funeral without telling me. Damn. Tank: And no one seen her since? Bri: Babe, no one that I have talked to has, no one seen her. Tank: Whatever. That still doesn't make it all right for you to hug on her, and make me look stupid. Bri: Babe, it wasn't even like that. If you feel like I made you look stupid, I apologize, I'm sorry, okay? Tank: Okay, let me find out, Bri. Bri: Hey, it's nothing to find out. Now come here and give me a kiss. You know I love you. Tank: Okay. Angel: That's crazy, because I remember hearing about that on the news a few years back. Roni? Baby, you know you're lucky to be alive, right? Roni: Yeah, I know, that's why I thank God every day. Angel: Well, I enjoyed myself with you tonight, so I guess it's only fair I give you that kiss you wanted. You are still in love with her, aren't you? Roni: Honestly? Yeah, I am still in love with her. It's like so many feelings came back tonight after seeing her for so long. Damn. Angel: I mean, she almost got you killed. Roni: Yeah I know you probably think I'm stupid, but it's like we was meant to be together. Angel: I disagree, but whatever, Roni: Okay, let me explain it to you. It's like we never got closure. And if a person never gets closure then you can't move on. Angel: What do you mean? Roni: For example, say two people broke up and they never got a chance to say good-bye, then they will miss each other because they never got a chance to fully heal to get the closure they needed. Angel: Oh. I guess you're right. I mean, I never ended a relationship on bad terms so I wouldn't know. Roni: Exactly. Good night, Angel. Angel: Good night, Roni, don't be a stranger. Call me sometimes, okay? Roni: All right. Jay: Hey, what's up, baby? Look, I was just informed I've got to work a little late tonight so they've got me coming in. Tasha: Oh, okay. Well how late? Jay: You know, one of the shift managers called off so they want me to stay and help out a little bit. Tasha: Well I hope it's not too late. I was thinking that we can go out just a little bit later? Jay: Oh yeah, most definitely. We can still do that, we can still go out. As soon as I get off I'll just call your phone. Tasha: Okay. Jay: Hey, I've got to get back to work, so I'll talk to you later. Tasha: All right. Love you. Jay: Love you too. Jay: Yeah, I'll be there in a couple of hours. Bye. Tasha: Hey, yeah, I'm okay. I'm just bored and lonely. You think I can come over? All right, cool. I'm on my way. Natalie: Chris, we really need to talk. I just want you to be honest with me, please. Call me back when you get this. Natalie: Hello, Chris? Nikki: Girl, this ain't Chris, why are you tripping? Chris: Who is this? Nikki: It's Nikki, you all right? Natalie: No, not really.

Tasha: Oh, so you just knew I was over here, huh? You fucking liar. How the fuck did you get in? Jay: Tasha, can't you see she's playing us against one another? Tasha: No, you Jake, you did this. You wanted a fucking threesome, remember? Jay: Baby, come on. Let's just go home, we can talk about this later. Tasha: No, I don't want to be with you anymore. I want to be with Qiana. Jay: What? Tasha, how could you? You -- Tasha: I don't care, Jay. I'd rather be with her, and I will come get my shit later. Qiana: You heard her Jay, we don't need you any more, so leave. Bye. Jay: Fuck you, man. Ton: So let me get this straight, you wanted to have a threesome with Tasha, had it, start fucking with the girl y'all did it with, and now you just caught them fucking, did I get that right? Jay: Yeah, nigga, that's right. Ton: Dude, what's wrong with you. Jay: What the fuck you mean? Ton: First of all, you don't do that shit with your woman, you do that shit with some bitches you don't care about for this very reason. Secondly, you never leave your girl around no carpet munchers, you be lucky if she ever speak to your ass again. Look, nigga, once a woman starts fucking with another woman it's been one or at least until they start missing some real dick and get tired of using them fake ones. Jay: Okay, motherfucker, I get it. Damn. Would you just shut the fuck up already. Ton: Yeah, okay. Why don't you go to this bachelor party with me tonight, take your mind off Tasha. Jay: Hell no, bro, I'm good. Man I ain't feeling that shit at all. Ton: Look, you're going. I'm not about to have my little brother sitting in here, crying his eyes out all night when he could be getting his dick sucked for a couple of singles. Jay: I'm good, bro. For real. I ain't feeling that shit. Ton: Dude, pull your skirt down. Jay: All right, bro, I've got some clothes I can throw on, man. Ton: All right. Natalie: Hey, I'm in here. Rob: My bad, I didn't know no body was there. Natalie: Okay, I'll be out in a minute. Can you please leave? Rob: You know, you could have did better out there. Natalie: What do you mean I can do better? Rob: I mean to me you looked a little uncomfortable. Natalie: Well, I was stripping and strangers was touching me, of course I'm going to be uncomfortable. Rob: Right and that's what I'm saying. You look too good to be stripping. I could see you do something better, like a model. Natalie: Modeling? Rob: Yeah. Yeah, modeling. Natalie: You're just saying that. Rob: No, actually I'm being very honest. I got a couple of friends in the modeling industry, maybe they can help you out, you never know. Here's my card, my name is Rob. Natalie: Okay. Thanks, Rob. Nikki: So we're going to go to this party. You want to go? Or do you want me to take you home first? Natalie: No, I'm kind of tired. I am going to go in tonight. Rob: I wouldn't mind taking you home. Then we can talk more about the modeling info? Nikki: Do you know him? Natalie: Sort of, he's okay, he's cool.

Nigga, I can't believe you, you know what, take me home -- Rob: Bitch, I ain't taking you no motherfucking where! Natalie: I'm getting the fuck up out of here -- [ Screaming ] [ Crying ] [ Music ] Roni: So how did you meet tank? Bri: Well -- Hey can I get your number? Tank: Hey. Can I holler at you for a minute? Hey. Hey. Can I holler at you for a second? Bri: Sure. I'm listening. Tank: My bad. My name's Tank, what's yours? Bri: My name is Brianna, but everybody calls me Bri. Tank: That's a cute name. Roni: Damn. So you really do love her, huh? Bri: Yeah, I do. But my feelings for her has changed, like I don't love her like that no more. Roni: Why not? Roni: Ever since she took over the streets she's just changed. She turned into this person I'm just not -- I don't even know. So just I'm just falling back. Roni: I feel you. It be like that sometimes. People don't know how to handle it, you know what I'm saying, streets, money, and fame, you know? Bri: Oh, trust me, I know. Like with all this money comes drama, the girls, the everything, I just don't have time for it, so my feelings is just -- not as strong as they used to be. I don't know. Roni: I feel you. Bri: So why didn't you let me know you were still alive? Roni: Come on, man. Do we really have to talk about that right now? Bri: But I'm just saying, Roni, like, is it what, somebody was telling you not to tell me, what, somebody was forcing you? Roni: Of course, everybody told me not to tell you, my mother, my father, shit, if they found out I was talking to you now they would think I was stupid. Bri: Why, it wasn't even my fault? Roni: How come it isn't your fault, you mess with the dude that messed with me. Man, I don't care, no matter what, I still don't think he deserved to die. Bri: Okay, but Roni, we both guilty of the same thing. You talking and, like, both of us had different people, mines was just more crazier than yours was and it just got out of hand. I apologize, but it really wasn't my fault. Roni: I hear you. I don't know, I just feel like all this -- both, you know, it could have been avoided. We should have been honest with each other from day one, but hey, shit happens, right? It's in the past now, right? Bri: Yeah. And now we're in the future. And I'm so glad you're alive, you don't even know how much I missed you. Roni: Why don't you prove it. Bri: Prove it, by what, letting you know how much I love you? Roni: Why don't you show me? Bri: Roni, I can't do this. Roni: Why? Bri: I can't do this. I'm with Tank. Roni, I'm with Tank. And I just -- I can't do this back and forth thing, I just really want it to be right between us, and if we are meant to be together we will be together. I can't do it like this, I can't do it like this, Roni. I love you, but I can't. Roni: All right. I respect your decision. Bri: Thank you. I just can't be back and forth like that. I just can't be back and forth, Roni. I want it to be right between us. Nothing like last time. Okay? Roni: All right. Jay: Packing, huh? This is crazy. So you a dyke now, Tasha, huh? You going to leave me for a bitch, just like Bri did Black. Is that what you're going to do? You know what's crazy, though, all this fucking time, maybe that's why y'all was best friends? Is that what it was? Yeah, that's what it was. And all this time you been so against it, you can't stand lesbians. You hate dykes, but you about to leave me for one. You know what, maybe you should have been getting that shit with Qiana. You could have saved both of us some fucking time, you could have been gone, you could have been packed your shit up. Tasha you're not going to talk to me? Huh? Tasha, you don't hear me talking to you? Tasha: Jay, I can't even look at you, let alone talk to you. Jay: And why is that? Tasha: Are you serious? Jay: Yeah, I'm dead serious. Tasha: You know what, I'm going to just hurry up and just get the rest of my shit and you do whatever it is you want to do, okay? Jay: So what the fuck is that supposed to mean? Tasha: Figure it out. Jay: Tasha, Tasha. Baby. Tasha: I fucking hate you, Jay. I really do. You did this shit to us, not me. You wanted a fucking threesome, remember, and look how this shit played out. Jay: Baby, don't you see that she just trying to play us against each other.

I swear, Jesus, I know I haven't been a good man for her, I know I've been wrong, I know I did wrong. Please bring her back to me. Please, God. I'll do anything. Fuck, man. Tasha: This is the second time, Jay. The second time. Three strikes, that's it. I'm tired of you fucking cheating on me. What the fuck is wrong with you? I love you, so why cheat on me? Huh? Why? What did I do to you to make you cheat on me? I've done everything -- everything for you, and this is how you repay me. After three I'm gone. There ain't nothing else I can do, okay? I love you.
