15th March 1922 Results of Test for 855 positions as 3rd Class Station Masters They've given me a job at Pistoia! Lucky guy! 855th place. La Quaglia Antonio, son of Calogero. Score: 1 point. Destination: Piovarolo. Help! HELP! Young man, is there anything wrong? -Do you feel ill? -l'd been waiting for 3 years. -The excitement, my heart-- -Do you want some water? A cordial? No, thanks. But l'd like to ask you a favor. Look in my waistcoat pocket for a chain. That's it. Thank you. All aboard! Finally, Antonio La Quaglia was able to embark on his new career. Chief, how do l look? Does it suit me? Please, don't say a word. l chose a slightly taller cap. Do you know why? l'll explain. With this regulation cap, when l've added 3 stripes or 4 at the most, there'll be no room for any more. However, with this taller one, l can add up to 8 stripes and an officer's badge. How do l look? Can you imagine me on the platform at the station, with my whistle? '' Ready to leave?'' Go! Off you go, engine driver! lNVENTOR OF THE LOCOMOTlVE ln the meanwhile, l'll wear this more modest version. lf you don't mind, sir, l'm now going to close my case or rather my personal baggage. Oh, just a moment! Let's try this on to see how it looks. Wonderful! All aboard! The train's about to leave! Just fantastic! Listen, Chief, we're leaving the Central Station at 9.00 am on the fast train 427. We'll reach Piovarolo-di-Sotto at 4.24 pm, on Track 1 . Naturally, you're not familiar with Piovarolo. l'll update you right away. Listen! The name Piovarolo comes from Piovano Arnulfo who founded it in 1 325 and not from the verb '' piovere'' meaning ''to rain'' as some believe. lf it rains at Piovarolo, it should be noisy at Chiasso, since ''chiasso'' means '' noise'' . ln Lecco, people should '' lick'' things. Piovarolo is a sunny, pleasant and healthy village situated in the foothills of the Appennines. The village is clean and tidy and has all the amenities required to guarantee that tourists have a pleasant, enjoyable stay. Healthy activities await vacationers who will also meet in Piovarolo all their cultural needs. The village is at the center of highly important historical events. l heard him with my own ears. General Garibaldi said to Nino Bixio: '' My dear Nino, here, we either found ltaly or we die.'' The local people are cheerful, outgoing and hospitable. Communication routes are easy to follow. A fine carriage road leads to the pretty little station, a source of pride and honor for Piovarolo and the hub of busy traffic. At the station in Piovarolo, tourists in transit waiting for their connection can, if necessary, comfortably spend the night there. Visit Piovarolo! Excuse me, sir! Daddy! Hurry! He's here! Go back indoors. Good day. You're the new station master, right? -And you're the old one. -You've come to replace me? You want to know if l'm the new manager of this pretty station? -Exactly. -l thought so. That's who l am. Maria! My wife. -Pleased to meet you. -Excuse me a moment. Don't cry! lt's him. We can leave now! Good riddance to Piovarolo! Load everything onto the carts and hurry! We want to catch the last bus. May l introduce myself? l'm Giulio lnnocenzi. Pleased to meet you. l'm Antonio La Quaglia. -Pleased to meet you. -The pleasure's all mine. No, no! This time, the pleasure's all mine. -lf you say so. -Believe me. -This way. -Thank you. -After you. -No! Ah, right, you're leaving and l'm taking over. This is the office. The lodgings are upstairs. -How come you arrived so late? -l took the 427. lt no longer stops here at Piovarolo. l had to get off and walk back. Naturally. The 427 non longer stops here as from yesterday. The 427 non longer stops here? -No. -l'll forward a complaint to the head office. The 427 will stop again, here, l assure you. l'm sure you'll be successful. Only local train stops here. Where's the ticket office? lt's in there, but it doesn't-- -Call Paolo. -Right away. Paolo's my colleague at the other-- -Excuse me one moment. -Do carry on. Hello? Boriglia? Boriglia is the next village. Hello? Paolo? lt's me. l've made it! Guess who's here in my office. The gull. No, l haven't been shooting. You're name means ''the gull'' , doesn't it? No, La Quaglia means ''the quail'' . -l'm Antonio La Quaglia! -Sorry! No, he's La Quaglia. l got mixed up. Antonio La Quaglia! He's my substitute. l understand, Paolo. l know. l have a family to feed. No, he's fairly young. As a punishment? l don't know. l'll ask him. -Are you here as a punishment? -No! l passed a test. He says he passed a test. Get that? And this is the prize. l have to go Paolo. Everything's packed and l have to leave now. l'll hand over to him then l'm off. Bye and thanks for everything. Don't forget to write. That's taken care of too. -l haven't forgotten anything. -What about that game? This comes with the office. lt's handy for killing time. -Do you know how to play? -Yes, but who can l play with? -With the manager at Santo Spirito. -Will he come here to play with me? No, he plays from Santo Spirito. -How can he do that? -Over the telegraph. See, we have letters and these are numbers. Do you wnat to move the knight? C2 moves to D4. You transmit it straight away. lt's easy like playing Battleships. l get it. lt's odd, though. Now, sit down here, my dear colleague, and sign in. Tell me, after how long does one generally get transferred? Around a couple of years. Long enough for a couple of games with the guy at Santo Spirito. -With your first promotion. -What's that? The 1 1 2 passing through. The last one, for me. -How many trains pass daily? -A dozen. -And overnight? -Even more. -Goodbye, dear colleague! -Have a good trip! Hey, my good man! Young fellow! l've come to welcome you. Are you the level crossing guard? -The female guard. -The female guard? -Why, are you a woman? -Can't you see that l'm a woman? Well, l suppose so. Listen, this station is rather undermanned, isn't it? Why do you say that? There are two of us, you and me. -And the manual workers? -l do the manual work. Didn't you say you're the level crossing guard? l'm the level crossing guard, the manual worker, the waiting room... attendant, and l take care of the station masters who are bachelors. -Are you a bachelor? -Yes, l am. -Then l'll look after you. -You're a sort of housekeeper. Without a title. My name's Beppa, -and l'm a spinster. -l'm not surprised. -Well, see you around. -Goodbye. The new station master 3rd class Antonio La Quaglia... ... began work and immediately... made a decision. He had to leave, as soon as possible, that station which was so different from the one he'd dreamed of. But despite everything, he wanted to make some improvements to make the place look nicer. His position as station master opened the doors for him to... the recreational center, the only form of leisure in the village. l heard him say it, with my own ears. General Garibaldi said to Nino Bixio: '' My dear Nino, here, we either found ltaly, or we die.'' When electricity was introduced, the trains seemed to pass through Piovarolo even faster and La Quaglia lost the last bit of enthusiasm left in him. What fun was there in the two daily stops of the rickety local train from which no passengers ever alighted. Thus, he acquired the habit of blowing his whistle before the wheels could grind to a halt. Carry on! -l'm so sorry, madam. -You don't know who l am! -l'm the new teacher! -l do apologize. Before whistling it on, look who's getting of the train. l'll report you! l'll teach you manners! Keep your hands off! -My flag! -Here! She really did report him. Worse still, La Quaglia saw her at the station every day because she taught in Piovarolo but lived in a nearby hamlet. The teacher fell that day and reported me. Right away, l received a reprimand from my boss. Does it seem fair... that when a silly girl falls down, it's the station master's fault? That's what l say. The station master is responsible. Responsible, my foot! For every girl that falls down, it's the station master's fault. Did she have to fall down in my station? lt isn't even a station. lt isn't even a level crossing, because here we're below sea level. -That's what l say. -But l'm not the type. l'm a tough customer. l'm a hard-headed man. l passed a test to come here. l came last but who cares? The last shall be the first. lsn't that what they say? l'll move heaven and earth to leave Piovarolo. -That's what l said. -lt's what l said too! -Seasoned with butter? -Yes. -The express is arriving. -l can feel it. The day will come when the 427 has to stop here. Here! Do me a favor. Go and whistle it through. -Me? -Yes, you. lt's racing through, you look like my uncle, no one will notice you. He had to do everything in his power to move up the ladder and obtain a transfer. But something extraordinary happened. One day, the sun suddenly came out unexpectedly. The old sun dial started working again to the excitement of the village folk. People spoke again of the 1 906 landslide... ... caused by the sun suddenly drying out the soil. But the consequence we're more interested in... ... was the terrible effect it had the already weak body of Ernesto, Garibaldi's bugler. With the dampness disappearing too suddenly, he came down with old reactionary pains and historical catarri. All hope was put in the hands of the local doctor. The news leaked beyond the boundary of Piovarolo... ... and spread by a word of mouth. Maybe it was for this reason that a few days later, a misterious car parked outside Ernesto's house. lt came from the capital. -Get out! Get out! -Tell him he's too stubborn and has no regard for politics. What a nuisance! Now, the party will accuse me of having wrecked... ... a propaganda drive of the greatest importance. lf l were you l'd contact the party executive and ask for instructions. There's no alternative. Let's look for a telephone. 1 , 2, 3. The seven of spades. Envy on the part of third parties. Envy? Of me? By third parties? lt's written! 1 , 2, 3, 4 of chalices. Victory or death in battle. -Death in battle? -lt's written! Let's stop this game. l don't believe this nonsense. ''Game cut short, future ill-fated'' . 1 , 2. Queen of spades. A woman. A woman? ls it written? Pretty but treacherous. She doesn't love you. Naturally! l've never seen her. That's normal. lntrigues! Jinxes! Evil spells! There's no doubt. lt's her... the teacher. She stirred up trouble to stop me getting a promotion. But one of these days, l'll show her who Antonio La Quaglia is. lt's dangerous to mess with me. -What's needed here is-- -An influential personality. A helping hand, a word in someone's ear. -But whose? -The king of chalices! The King of chalices? Don't make me laugh! An important man will come into your life. Come in. -What can l do for you? -Are you the station master? Yes, l am. Sorry! Beppa, you can go. We need to ask you a favor. lf our regulations allow it, l'm happy to oblige. -We need to use the phone. -Not permitted by our regulations! -Come on! -Article 1 1 1 , paragraph 1 6. -ln a case of forces majeures-- -That's in paragraph 1 7. lt's up to me to decide if it's a case of forces mejeures or not. What a fuss you're making! You don't know who l am. Yes, l do. You're a man who won't make a phone call. Don't jeopardize your carrer. We'll get this man dismissed. We'll ruin him. Do you want to know who l am? This is my identity card. l'm Marcello Gorini, Member of Parliament, for goodness' sake! You make the call! -What's he looking at? -The King of chalices. -What's he saying? -Your Majesty, may l kiss... Don't kiss me! Call Rome! -Where do l have to call? -Rome. Rome? From here? From my phone? -What's odd about that? -Call Rome from my telephone? Hello, Miss. Rome, please. Yes, Rome! lt's a case of forces majeures. Who must l ask for? -The Socialist Party executive. -The Socialist Party executive. You'll call me back. Thanks. The Socialist Party? A truly great party! Deputy, l've heard that Socialist Party members... ... help each other like brothers. -lt's a sort of clan. -Don't talk nonsense. You must excuse me, sir. As a politician, l'm not worth a light, -but as a station master-- -Leave him! He has other worries... -... with the crisis on in Rome. -What does he want from me? l'm wasted here in Piovarolo. Have me transferred. l'll be credit to you, you'll see. Pulling strings is against my principles. l know, Deputy, but this is a case of forces majeures. Listen: '' For the localities served by the section terminus when the special section terminus starts at the secondary one and doesn't go through the main section terminus, the announcement must be made at the main section terminus and all the other along the line.'' -What's a section terminus? -There's the rub. lt is the most... complex article of regulations. No one has ever understood it. Rome calling! Hello? Minister, Deputy Gorini has spoken to me so highly of you. Minister, l'm the station master at Piovarolo. -Please, have me transferred. -Hello? Yes, it's me. There was an idiot causing interference on the line. -Help me, Minister! Help! -Hello? Hello? Yes, l'll inform Ferruglio. But tell me, what about the crisis? l see. The crisis is still at the same point. lt's at the same point, like me. There's a crisis at my station. Call Ferruglio to the phone. Hello? Ferruglio? -lt's me. -Put in a good word for me. There's nothing to be done. The old man won't give in. We've tried but he won't accept. We've offered that. Excuse me, Ferr-- Very well. l'll make another attempt. Very well. 'Bye, Ferruglio. We have to make another attempt with the old man. He must give in. -How will you convince him? -lt's an order. l must obey it. Deputy, why don't we stress the patriotic side of the issue? -Where's the Town Hall? -Farther ahead. -To the Town Hall! -Deputy! Deputy! Deputy! Station Master! Ernesto has something to tell you. -Come closer. -l can't. -Why not? -You're a man. Of course l am. Shout louder because l can't hear you. Ernesto has something to tell you. l know. He's already told me several times. He's at death's door and wants a favor only you can do him. He wants a favor from me? What does he want? -l've no idea. Please come. -Very well. He's about to embark on his final journey. Maybe that's why he needs the station master. My goodness! He's already dead. -Oh! You've come, at last. -So you're not dead? Come closer. l've something to tell you. l'm all ears. What is it? They're all saying l'm at death's door. -lt's just gossip. Take no notice. -Don't think l'm sorry to go. At last l'll be able to see my General and Bixio. -Dear Nino! -l'm all ready. Look! This is my Calatafimi battle uniform. Here's my bugle. Everything's ready. All l need is my cap. -What's this? -lt's all eaten up by mice. But they left me the peak. l need to find another one straight away. l've only hours to live. You expect to find a red cap in Piovarolo? Who'll give you one? What size cap do you wear? Very small. l've a tiny head. lt's really miniscule. -Let me try your cap on. -Bugler, l fear you want to exploit Garibaldi's only shameful deed. That of having copied the station masters' cap. lt's a controversial matter. Give me your cap. -Don't keep on! -You can't refuse... ... a dying man a favor. This sound like blackmail! You're embarrassing me. -lt's not correct on your part. -What will l do? -What about the General? -Don't dramatize! He may not even recognize you. There were a thousand of you. Pull up my blankets, at least. l'll be happy to do so. l do whatever l can. -Let go of my cap. -No! Struggling, you'll die sooner! Let go of my cap. Make way! Can't you see l'm carrying the Piovarolo flag? Give me my cap. What else do you want? Get out! -Were you looking for me? -You're always in the way! ln the name of Piovarolo whose flag l carry, l ask you once again to satisfy our request. No! l've already told you it would be a sham. What are you saying, dear friend? lt won't be a sham. lt's just a nuance. We're asking you to turn that sentence into: '' Dear Nino, here we either found Socialist ltaly or we die.'' What difference does it make? He may have said just that but you didn't hear him. You were in the thick of the battle among the cannons and guns. Or you may have forgotten it as it was so long ago. Deputy, come here a moment. -Are you sure? -Try me. -Right away? -Right away. You've agreed to everything, right? My dear friend, l'll try to do something for you. Empty words! '' l'll try to do something for you.'' l want a section terminus station, full equipped... ... with 4 tracks and a canopy. Dear friend, l can't promise you a section terminus station like that. lf you can't, ltaly will stay just as it is. By the way, a train will be arriving in ten minutes. l must go. Goodbye. l'm going now. No, wait! You'll get your section terminus station. On your honor as a Deputy? ls that agreed? Leave everything to me. Turning up in front of the General without a cap wouldn't be elegant. Do you want this cap? Shall we give this young man the cap? Do you want it? Stay still while l put it on. There you are! How fine he looks! Beppa! -Where's your cap, boss? -lt's in the right place. Remember, Beppa, you're talking to a section terminus station master, promoted and transferred for his exceptional merits on orders from the government. -Have you checked everything? -Everything's in order, boss. -The brakes? -ln order! Check out the young lady's train, -otherwise she'll report us. -Will do, boss! Ready to leave? Off you go! Excuse me, Chief, we need some information. ls it true there's an old soldier of Garibaldi's in this village -who heard with his own ears-- -'' My dear Nino, here we either found Socialist ltaly or we die.'' -Socialist ltaly? -lt's just an update. We're ruined! They've beaten us to it! They've succeeded in their intent. Deputy De Fassi, here, belongs to the Popular Party. And in our opinion, Garibaldi said: '' Dear Nino, here we either found Popular ltaly or we die.'' lt's a serious matter. We must telephone Rome right away. -What'll we do? l'm responsible. -You? With my last will and testament and everything contained therein, l confirm and undersign the following, in full possession of my faculties. Here you are! Just sign. Give me the cap, first. There you are. Sign here. SOClALlSTS BEATEN -Stop what you're doing! ltaly will not become a socialist state. Read this. l've caught you out, you trickster, you charlatan, you liar, you phony mister fix-it! They're the ones in charge. The Popular Party is in power, not you! Don't forget the section terminus station for me. All that remains is for you to accept defeat, Deputy. Let's go. As for you, you turncoat, l, Marcello Gorini, assure you that you'll rot in Piovarolo for the rest of your life. We've seen what your word is worth. -You'll see that l'm right. -l'm not afraid of you. You'll see l'm right. Deputy, how are we going to define ltaly? -What are you getting at? -Come on, Signor Ernesto! lt only requires a tiny correction. Forget it! l'm not falling for any more tricks. May l? l want to see it on you. Keep it on for just a minute. May l? l want to check something. So, will we found ltaly as this gentleman wants it? -l'll obey. -l'll obey. Who's this? Deputy, we've fallen. But we've picked ourselves up. ln Rome, they're forming a government with the Socialists. -With the Socialists? -Come to the phone, please. -Excuse me a moment. -Go! Go! Bugler, do me a favor. Don't die immediately. l have to leave but l'll be back and we'll decide on our next move. Long live the government of reconciliation. And national concentration. Now we need to try and convince -Garibaldi to change that sentence. -Now ltaly is Populist-Socialist. Garibaldi's words will guarantee the continuation of the Risorgimento tradition. My dear party leaders, this valiant railroad official has just one request. Assign me a section terminus station. Naturally! He wants his section terminus station. -We did promise. -So, shall we--? -Viterbo! -No! -Viterbo's a nice town. -l want somewhere farther north. Then how about Massa Carrara? No. Massa Carrara sounds like two towns, but it's one. -Come up! Farther north! -Name your town. Shall l? You won't say l'm asking for too much? -What a pain! -He says: ''What a pain!'' -He doesn't really mean it. -Shall l say it? -Naples. -Goodness gracious! -Naples is a bit too-- -Too much to ask? Well-- You know-- -Naples! -Naples! How lovely! -What's happening? -l don't know. SATURDAY, OCTOBER 28th 1 922 -lt's over. -That's it! What will you do, now? l can go back to being a lawyer. What about you? l may find a job as a professor. -What's happened? -What we had been fearing for long. -ltaly has become Fascist. -Fascist? ltaly is Fascist? Would you like a ride in my car, my distinguished lawyer? l certainly would, my illustrious professor. '' Dear Nino, we either found a Fascist ltaly, or we die.'' Poor man! He insisted on trying to sound the charge and the thrombosis killed him. The thrombosis? -Don't you mean the bugle? -Acute thrombosis. Right! An acute on the bugle. To be or not to be Fascist. That is the question. lgnore the rules, starve to death or maybe defy bad fortune and battle against the adversities of life. Chief, l've been sent this. My dear Chief, as an engineer you couldn't care less because in your day, when your first train left the Fascist party didn't exist. Chief, do you know what the circular says? ''Wear the badge'' , but it doesn't say where. What am l to do? While awaiting a clarification on the issue, l'll carry it in my pocket. No one will be the wiser. Don't breathe a word! ''A lack of Fascist spirit'' . This shortcoming is punished with a warning that will affect your career in the future. The badge is to be worn in your lapel buttonhole. l don't have any buttonholes so where do l wear it? You complain too much, Station Master. One of these days, they'll send you to a forced residence. l wish they would! l'd choose a residence on the Swiss border. Plenty of clocks, chocolate, pretty Swiss maids! Forced residences are on a desert island. -Are there no stations? -There are no trains. So l'll have to remain interned here in Piovarolo. l'd prefer that. With hope in his heart, he continued to read transfer list. Antonio La Quaglia, from Piovarolo to Rocca lmperiale. l've been transferred! l've been transferred! Beppa, l've been transferred to Rocca lmperiale! He finally received a circular that was different from the others. Chief, this isn't a circular, it's an attack! Here, in ltaly, they've put a stop to Man's last form of freedom, the choice not to marry. Bachelors will be held back. l have to get married right away. lt's 2 months to my next raise. l'll get married, but to whom? Chief, do you know what else the circular says? Would you like to know? lt says: For every 2 children you'll receive a promotion. Have they gone mad? lf my physical strengh holds out, in 1 5 years, l'll be a department chief. Chief, do you know what l think? l'll marry the first woman l set eyes on. -Here l am, boss. l take that back. l made a mistake. l meant: l'll marry the second woman l set eyes on. ls that clear? But are you sure you're ready for this step, my son? Father, if l don't take this step now, l'll no take no further steps in my career. So you want some advice to help you with your search. l only know you. l don't mix with the locals. Our sacristian has been through the same experience. -He married in Piovarolo. -Really? Father, you should warn him he won't have much choice. All the best ones have been taken. There must be someone left over. Now l think of it, there is one respectable young lady. l know who he means. She's a woman who's suitable for an official like yourself. She's moral, hard-working and sensible. -l get it! She's cross-eyed. -No, she's lame. l knew she must have something wrong with her. Anyway, l'll be able to tell you whether she's suitable for you. Celestino's daughter is so kind hearted -and very sensible. -Thank you, Father. All the spinsters in the village are seated in the front row. Go on! Take a look without letting them see you. Listen, Celestino, l'm an official. l need a wife, a '' better half'' , but they were all extremely ugly. Don't lose heart. You'll see that this one will suit you fine. -lsn't this the cemetery? -Yes. This way, sir. Celestino, you're not trying to marry me off to a grave digger! No. She's a widow. l hope you have no objections to that. On the contrary-- This way? -Rita? -Good evening. May l introduce Antonio La Quaglia, the station master? -My condolences. -Do you mind my asking Celestino... -... to bring you here? -Not at all. lt's a delightful spot: hospitable, cozy, pretty. -l want to introduce you to Luca. -l'll be happy to meet him. -Where is this Luca? -Here he is. LUCA, SNATCHED FROM LlFE ON EARTH. RlTA, HlS lNCONSOLABLE WlDOW -The deceased? -My husband. On his deathbed, he made me promise: '' lf you remarry, bring him along and introduce him.'' Do you like him? He's a good man. What? You want to know his job? He's the station master. -You're the station master, right? -Yes, l am. His name is Antonio Lo Merlo. Excuse me, but it's La Quaglia. l'm Antonio La Quaglia son of Calogero. A name that's romantic, light and airy. He was so jealous, you know. On the other hand, l'll bet Mario couldn't care less. -Who's Mario? -Her first husband. SNATCHED FROM LlFE BY A TERRlBLE lLLNESS. RlTA, lNCONSOLABLE WlDOW He didn't love me much. When he died he was angry with me. -Why? -Because he caught typhus off me. Well, you can't blame him. Typhus is very serious. Now, l'll just leave these flowers with Giuseppe and l've finished. -Who's this Giuseppe? -My miller husband. AFTER A LlFE'S WORK lN THE FlELDS HE DlED. RlTA, lNCONSOLABLE WlDOW -So, you've had three husbands? -Yes, Mario, Giuseppe and Luca. -And you buried them all together? -Why not? The plot's so big! And there's still one vacant space. lt's true! One, two, three and a vacant space. l'm sorry, l was forgetting a train is due in shortly. See you another time! Goodbye! A train is due in. -When will we meet again? -On November 2nd. Now, let's repeat P and A. P and E! P and l! Come in! All rise, children. Greet our visitor. Well done, children. Be seated. l've come to talk with you briefly in private. Fine. Keep an eye on your classmates. -What's up? -lt's a very delicate matter. The Education Authority has written to me. -About me? -Yes. From a background check they did it turns out that your father-- -But l can prove-- -Yes, l'm perfectly aware of that. An the Education Authority knows it too. My loyalty to the party must be worth something. Yes, but if you could close that matter once and for all-- By changing name, getting married. -Here in Piovarolo? -Here in Rocca lmperiale. lf l were single-- For you, we need someone in an important position who is single. Who are the bachelors here in Rocca lmperiale? The priest. Leave everything to me. l'll solve the problem. -lt's in your interest. -Thank you. Goodbye. Chief, l've only 1 5 days left. ln two weeks l have to find a wife, get my papers and marry. lt's absolutely impossible. There simply isn't time. Chief, look at me. As an official, l'm ruined. -Excuse me! -Who's that? May l come in for a moment? Non-authorized people are not allowed in here. Am l really a non-authorized person? -Just for a moment? -Very well. l'll make an exception. Come on in. l'm making an exception just this once. Come in. What do you want? -ls this your office? -lt is. -lt's very nice. -Yes, it's fairly comfortable. -You can sit here. -l'm fine! ls this your desk? Yes, it's my desk. You can see it needs a feminine touch. -Why? -There are no flowers on the desk. You're right. How silly we were to torment each other like that. -When are we leaving? -Just a moment! -Bye! -Bye-bye! What a lot of time we foolishly wasted! lt's all water under the bridge. -Thank you! -Thank you all! But leave us alone, now. l'm sure you understand. Goodbye. Close the door. Alone, at last! lt's bad news. 1 8 trains full of workers will come through here tonight, our wedding night. l thought we'd be going on honeymoon after the wedding. Don't get angry, dear. You must be patient. The main thing is that we got married. What is a honeymoon? lt's a train between 2 bedrooms. We have one bedroom between two trains. ls that clear? Don't get angry. Come on! Let's get organized. Sit down, Sara. Listen carefully. Between the 7.45 pm fast train and the 7.56 pm one, -we'll have dinner. -And then? Then we'll have 1 2 minutes to cut the cake and make a toast. And then? -There's the 8.08 pm local train. -And then? 4 minutes after we've gone to bed, l have to come down for the transit -of the 8.1 2 pm express. -And then? Then l'll come back to bed until the 20.2 1 pm freight train. And then? 3 minutes here, 4 there, 5 over there, we'll have time for a kiss. -And then? -And then to hell with you, me, the railroad, Piovarolo, the tracks, the trains until 6.32 tomorrow morning, when the workers' trains start to transit again. So for the moment-- ''We've learned, with regret, of your marriage to a person not belonging to the Arian race. Prior to further measures, we are obliged to interrupt the processing of your promotion.'' Good day to natives and visitors. Good morning, chief. My good people, they start out innocuously and end up like the S.S. -Have you heard the latest news? -No. No? l'll enlighten you. lt seems Germany wants to go to war against Britain and France. There's been nothing but talk of war these last few months. l think war will be necessary for the well-being of nations. -What do you mean? -lt's very clear. There are certain politicians in certain countries who, as soon as they come to power, in order to win the admiration of their fellow... countrymen start worrying about the social and financial conditions... of their nations. They say: ''Our people are living in poor... conditions. There's unemployment, poverty and hunger.'' Then what do they do? 4 or 5 of them meet and, always ''for the good of their nations'' , decide to go to war. -What happens if they lose? -No problem! No problem! Thank you. Do you know what a friend of mine used to say? ''Concentrate on the little things.'' There are other honest politicians who, worried about the hardship caused by the lost war-- Do you know what they do? 4 or 5 of them hold another meeting and, always for the good of the people, they decide to have another war. -l hope it doesn't happen to us. -This time we won't be involved. lf there is a war, we'll keep out of it. We'll stay neutral and make a lot of money. Neutral like Switzerland. My friends, we're a cunning people. Moreover, France, Britain and Germany all love us. Believe me. Have faith in your station master. QUlET! THE ENEMY lS LlSTENlNG! ls that clear, Beppa? Quiet! The enemy is listening! -Antonio! -What's up? l have a craving. ls this the right time to get a craving? lt's not me who wants lamb and potatoes. lt's the baby. Have you gone stark raving mad? ls that a suitable dish for a child who's not born yet? Lamb and potatoes is heavy. lt'll give it stomach ache. No lamb or potatoes. Go back to sleep. lf it's born with a craving for lamb, it'll be your fault! ls that a reasonable craving to get at this time of night, in wartime? Couldn't you have gotten a craving for soup or something light? Where will l find lamb at this hour? The party secretary found some. Walking by his window, l could smell it cooking. You're... no less important than him. You don't know how to command respect. The party secretary's a big-wig, so obviously he gets what he wants. ls that clear? Now, it's time to sleep. l promise you as soon as the war's over l'll buy you a lamb this tall. Fine! But if it's born with a craving for lamb and potatoes, it'll be your fault and don't forget it. How do you want it? Roast, stewed with potatoes or ''alla cacciatora'' ? -What? -How do you want the lamb? -''Alla cacciatora'' . -l'll go and look for some. -Who is it? -A comrade. -At this hour? -Why not? A comrade's a comrade round the clock, isn't he? -What's the matter? -Guess! -How can l guess? -l kew you couldn't guess. My wife's expecting a baby and she's gotten a craving for lamb. -What can l do about it? -lt's your fault. This morning, you cooked lamb. My wife passed by, smelled the aroma and now-- What are you talking about? l haven't eaten lamb for 2 years. l know you have to set a good example, but l won't say a word. -Will you give me a little piece? -lt's 2 years since l ate lamb. l understand. But maybe you've a piece left over from 2 years ago. Comrade! We're at war! This is no joking matter. You mustn't allow your wife to get certain cravings. -l know, but-- -l'm surprised you came to me, aware of who l am, to ask me if l'd eaten lamb. Don't you know that anyone who eats lamb nowadays is guilty of sabotage against our nation at war? Go home, now, and tell your wife that certain ideologies could confuse your reasoning as a heroic official, exposing you... to the risk of harsh punishment, made even harsher when... it's determined by the indignation of the entire population. -Up with us! -What? -Up with us! -Ah, right! Up with us! -Antonio! -What's up? -Did you find the lamb? -Yes. When are you going to bring it up? Right away. l'm preparing it. My dear kitty, let's have a chat person to person. You were born in Piovarolo, a village in the back of beyond. lt's a terrible place. Nobody will feed you tripe, here. What's there to live for? l won't make you suffer. lt'll be over in a second. After, you'll rest in peace. You'll be happy. What is it? Come on up. Good evening. The Secretary is asleep so l was able to come. He ate a huge portion of lamb so l brought some for your wife. The Secretary had the cheek to say he'd not eaten any for two years. Please don't let on, otherwise he'll fire me. -Antonio? -l'm coming! Don't worry. l won't say a word. l'll be as silent as the grave. Bye-bye and thanks. l'm coming! Cheer up, kitty! There's an amnesty. You've been reprieved, thanks to this. -Antonio, is it ready? -Yes, it is. -ls it already cooked? -lt was as tender as butter. -What? -lt was as soft as butter. lt smells delicious. You S-O-B! You rotten little animal, come back! lt was for my child, you scoundrel. lt was for my child. My poor child with no lamb! HE WHO HESlTATES lS LOST With the return of freedom and democracy even Piovarolo returned to its former splendor. reacquiring the right to its old name steeped in history. A history Antonio continued to be part of, against his will. We've already met, remember? Weren't you Deputy De Fassi's secretary? But that time you came to Piovarolo-- You threw away your briefcase and got on that train. -l don't remember. -You don't remember? You're not the only one. One move after another, one square after another, Antonio La Quaglia carried on his never-ending game. The seasons came and went, the years rolled by, the trains became faster, but Antonio La Quaglia is still here. He's been forgotten. His problems grew like mushrooms in the rain. His daughter wasn't born with a craving for lamb, but a hundred cravings of different nature and rather difficult to satisfy in Piovarolo. Do you want an umbrella, Miss? l need this rain. lt cleanses inside. -But it's just water. -You can't understand these things. -Any post? -Yes, a registered letter for you. They've replied! Are you still here? ''We're pleased to inform you two photos of yours have been published on the page 'How to become a star: new faces'.'' -Hey! Are you trying to kill me? -lt's only a little stone. Call it little stone. lt's a heavy rock. lf it had hit me, it would have killed me. Be more careful! What happened? She nearly killed me with a 50 kilo rock. With what? -1 00 kilo rock off the mountainside -A hundred kilos? She nearly killed me. Hey, you up there! A one ton bolder has broken off. Stop! Stop! There's a landslide. -Where? -On the railroad tracks. Take him away! Go on! Have you heard? There's a landslide 300 meters wide. Watch where you're going. Look what you've done. -Mount Pizzolungo has collapsed! -My God! Pizzolungo has collapsed! -lt's still collapsing! -Lord help us! The mountain has collapsed. -The mountain? Where? -On the railroad tracks. Good heavens! We must warn the station master. For goodness sake, will you turn that off? -Mariuccia, come down. -l'm coming, Mom. One of these days, l'll throw that gramophone under a train, got it? The poor girl! lt's the only fun she has here in Piovarolo. -Really? -Try this on. -l won't wear it, Mom. -Try it on at least! What do l care, with this bunch of oafs that live here? -lt's incredible. -Stand up. -What for? -l'll try it on you. Stand up. -Are you crazy? -Take off your jacket. -Come on! Take it off! -l can't stand this any more! l'm a serious person. lf anyone came in the door-- Be quick! -Chest out! -There! -Farther out! -This is all l have. -Hold this up. -What l have to do at my age! l want to leave this place. l don't want to stay here. l don't blame you. Let's be reasonable. This is a terrible place, l know. No question about it! But until l get a transfer, we have to wait and that's it. Live horse and you'll eat grass. l don't know if the grass will live and the horse will eat. You must have faith. Look me in the eye. lt's easy to say: '' l'm leaving!'' Where are you going? -l already have carreer prospects. -Really? ln what field? -The movies. -Exactly! The movies. Don't talk nonsense! The movies! She's young and mustn't end up like her mother. -Why? How did you end up? -Don't push me, Antonio. -Come on! How did you end up? -Don't get me started. l allow you to say whatever you like. Out with it! l married a wimp, a klutz, a loser. A scoundrel who brought me to live in a water-logged dump. One day, with the dampness and boredom, l'll grow moldy. No! Neither of you will. l'm the one who's growing moldy. -You should be ashamed. -Right! Shame on you, Dad. -Be quiet! -She's right to want to leave. You're right. But what chance did l ever have? -l did everything l could. -That's what l mean. The phone. Keep quiet. Hello? What? Train 427 has been classified as ''special'' . Why? Who? The Minister of Communications? The Minister of Communications in person? Coming through here? Did you hear that? The Minister of Communications is coming through. Mount Pizzolungo has collapsed. -Mount Pizzolungo? -Yes, 3 kms away, onto the tracks. How do you know? The miller's son told me. He nearly got crushed, poor boy. -Good heavens, what'll l do? -l have to get back to my pharmacy. What'll l do? The 427 is coming. The Minister is on board. l must stop the train. Look at me! The timing of this landslide is absolutely perfect. This is the day my dreams will be fulfilled thanks to a landslide. Firstly, l'll finally have the pleasure of stopping the 427. Moreover, l'll have the chance to save the passengers' lives, particularly His Excellency's ln return for my heroic deed, His Excellency the Minister won't hesitate a moment before granting me a promotion. Will l be sent to Milan, Turin or Genoa, Florence, Bologna or Pisa? l don't know. Anyway, ladies, l feel really happy because from this moment, l, La Quaglia, have His Excellency in the palm of my hand. For this occasion l need my old uniform, the classical one. l'll show him what Antonio La Quaglia's made of. Beppa! Get out the petards. l'll show you what Antonio La Quaglia's made of. He's one of a kind. Beppa! Let's hope this is his lucky chance. -Beppa! -Here l am. Hurry! Chief, here are the petards. Take up your position and close the level crossing immediately. My goodness! Such a calculation to make in so little time. The train must stop here, not one meter farther on, not one back. Let's see: 7 x 8 - 56. Now, onto double figures. 4 + 4 - 8, 8 - 2 - 6, 6 x 6 - 36, 606. Eureka! Mathematics is not an opinion. Let's put one here. Another here. Another here. Here. Another here. And the last one can go here. The Milan station master thinks he's so smart. l want to see him here with little material and few men. Train, if l think of how many passengers you're carrying, knowing everything depends on me! Here we are, face to face. Man to man, eyeball to eyeball. You've made me dance for the last 20 years. Enough is enough! 427, it's between us now! Come on! What's happening? Congratulations! A wonderful maneuver! A scientific maneuver! l'll put you up for a medal. -l'm coming. -Listen-- -Piovarolo! Piovarolo! -Chief, what's happening? There's been a landslide! -What? A landslide? -Don't be afraid. -There's nothing to fear? -What should you fear? Do you think a mountain will fall onto the tracks? Stay calm. Don't get agitated. We're here to do our job. -So the line's blocked? -There are 20 meters of rock. -Can't they be cleared? -How do l clear 30 meters of rock? -You said 20. -20, 30, 40, 50. What do we know? lt might be a real cataclysm. You know how mountains are formed. Piovarolo! Piovarolo! l'm a railroad official. Why have you stopped the train? First things first. La Quaglia. -A quail stopped the train? -No, La Quaglia is my name. l stopped the train in compliance with art. 22 of our regulations. -A 500 ton landslide on the tracks. -Where? -At the 3rd kilometer, on the left. -Did you carry out an inspection? Not yet, because the landslide's just occurred. -How did you hear about it? -From an eye witness. The miller's son, poor boy, was nearly crushed. -We must inform His Excellency. -lt's my job to inform him. You're an official? Hold this and wait. -Minister? -Come in. May l? l'm the station master, La Quaglia. l heard a quail had fallen under the train. -ls it dead? -There's a misunderstanding. -l'm La Quaglia. -Thank goodness you're not hurt. So, why have we stopped? l'm here to tell you that 3 kms up the line there's been a landslide. -But where are we? -At Piovarolo, Your Excellency. lt's not an important station. lndeed, it's not worthy of you, but unfortunately, l've worked here all my life. However small a station may be, it's always a great responsibility. The station master, if only you knew, Your Excellency-- The sense of responsibility of all the small station masters guarantee the safety of the entire network. -l'm pleased with you. -You're too kind. You still haven't told me where we are. Yes, l did, Your Excellency. At Piovarolo. -Why have we stopped? -lt was my decision. -To safeguard your precious life. -l'm just a public servant. l applied article 22. -l see. l'm glad. -l took all the precautions. l positioned the petards and the red signal lights. Did you see? -Naturally! Very interesting. -Quite spectacular! But you haven't told me why we've stopped here. Because of the landslide. -Ah, yes, it fell on the pheasant. -No, the quail. -Actually, l'm La Quaglia. -So we've stopped at Zagarolo. -Where have we stopped? -l don't remember. Piovarolo! l was confused. lf Your Excellency agrees, l'd like to have the pleasure of showing you the workings of the devices in my humble station. The excellency of the railroad-- -ls you! -No! -But Your Excellency-- -No. l say the excellency of the railroad is indicative of how civilized a nation is. l'll happily observe these humble devices... ... on which so much depends. -So much. -Right! So much! -So much. My coat, please. Your Excellency, will you do me the honor? Will you visit the station? -l will. -l'll lead the way. Hurry, Mariuccia. We must cut a good figure with the Minister. Our future depends on it. We'll finally leave this godforsaken village. ls it all tidy? Look! They're coming. -Won't you take off your apron? -l'll be keeping out of sight. Chief, l'm counting on you! This way, Your Excellency. Would you do me the honor-- Sorry! Have a seat, Your Excellency. This is my desk. A man has ambitions even if he's only a station master, am l right? lt's very good citizen's natural right. l've put 35 years' service here among trains, tracks, switches, telegraphs, telephones, lights and signals always in the rain. Because it always rains here in Piovarolo. Your Excellency, l'd like, as the saying goes, a place in the sun. -As the saying used to go! -Excuse me. Believe me, l'm a true democrat. And by preventing a disaster today, l've earned credit. -Naturally! -Shall we start the visit? This is the telephone. This is how it works. The flags: red and green. -And white. -No, it isn't our national flag. These are for signaling. Green for ''Go'' , red for ''Stop'' . This is the telegraph, my faithful friend. Do you know what l said? Long live His Excellency! -Thank you. -l'll do it again. Over here, as you can see, we have the control panel. Very interesting. lt's second hand, but here in Piovarolo l can't hope for more. -lf you would do me the honor-- -How does it work? lt's very simple. Look! You pull a lever, like this. -But nothing came out. -lt's not like a slot machine. -lt's a control panel. -Do they all work? Every one. No! Don't do that! The fast train from Genoa won't stop till it gets to Domodossola. -lt goes from Genoa-- -To Domodossola. l must say these stations are a body of technical devices that are very interesting. Very! You're right. Wise word! So, will you remember poor La Quaglia? Oh, poor thing! The one that died under the landslide. -No, l'm La Quaglia. -Oh, right! -l'm so glad you got out alive. -What am l asking for? -A promotion. -A place in the sun. A transfer to a place where l can finally show what l'm worth. l've been buried alive here. Besides, it's not so much for me as for my daughter. Mariuccia! -She needs an education. -Right! l'm particularly concerned about young people's problems. By the way, do you have any children? Your Excellency-- -This is my daughter. -Pleased to meet you. -ls she an old child? -Yes, sir. -l'm pleased. -Thank you. Coming back to what we were discussing, is there hope for me? There is! lt won't be Milan, Genoa, Turin, Florence or Bologna, but who knows? A word from you opens doors. We'll see. Something will be done for you. Thank you. Did you hear him? Something will be done for me. Your father was right. Thank him. -Thank you, Your Excellency. -What for? -For what you'll do for my father. -What will l do-- Oh, right! We'll see. Do you need anything? A mineral water? A snack for the trip? A plate of spaghetti? Prepare a plate of pasta for him. Thank you but l never drink between meals. -As you wish. -Excuse me. -You're wife's very pretty. -She's my daughter. Quite so! Come in. -Excuse me. May l? -But of course! How pretty it is! Really lovely! Delightful! Are they on sale here? This is for signaling departures. -To say when they can leave. -Oh, right! To signal ''Go'' . May l ask the station master to show me the landslide? -Has there been a landslide? -The one l told you about. -The same one? Thank goodness. -With your permission-- -l'll come too. -What an honor for me! Your Excellency on the site of the disaster. After you. This way. -This is the 3 kilometer point. -Where's the landslide? -What landslide? -The one we stopped for. -Right! Where's the landslide? -lt was here. -Pasquale, where's the landslide? -l don't know. lt was here. -Someone must have stolen it. -Why did you invent the landslide? -Why did you stop the train? -l didn't invent anything. l was told by the pharmacist who's an honest man. He'd been told Pasquale, here, was the person who had avoided being crushed in the nick of time. There's the landslide! You call this rock a landslide? Your Excellency, one must make do with what one has. Everything is in proportion. This is a small village, so it has small landslides. Bigger places have bigger ones. lf you wanted a huge landslide, you should have gone to the Alps. Maybe it's a case of being over-cautious. -lt's true. -You can never be too careful. Thank you. You see? His Excellency agrees with me. All on board! Your Excellency, in the new post you'll send me to, l'll reminisce on this memorable night. Off you go! -We can't leave. -Why? The no-go signal is on. Your Excellency, what have you been up to? You've left the red light on. l'll fix it right away. Fine! Fine! His record is terrible. l'm not suggesting a promotion but a transfer. lt'd be a reward. He should be punished for stopping a train without a good reason. He invented the story about the landslide. For 30 years the Ministry's been receiving bad reports on him. He seems so zealous. l can't believe he invented this affair. l'm absolutely sure of it. Knowing you were on this train and wanting to talk with you, he organized this charade. -He must be severely punished. -We'll see. l'll see. One will see. lt's all in order, Your Excellency. Bon voyage. -Bon voyage. -Thank you. All the best! l'll wait, full of confidence. lt won't be for long, will it? -Just wait. -Thank you. Bon voyage. Off you go! l'll have to report this serious bending of the rules. What? Oh! lf you feel it's right, go ahead. -lt's a done deal! -At last! Be happy, my child. Goodbye, Piovarolo! Goodbye, station! Maybe a great metropolis awaits you. See? Honest people are always rewarded. Especially people... ... like me who've spent their entire life serving faithfully. A transfer? No way! He'll never be moved from Piovarolo. Fine! Fine! What a good man His Excellency is. Here! You deserve it!
