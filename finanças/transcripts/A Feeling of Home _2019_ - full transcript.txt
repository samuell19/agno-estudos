You ready, Abby? Yeah. And action! How many of you know that the traditional New England clambake began with Native American tribes? Years before the Europeans got here they were cooking their lobsters, corn and mussels in sand pits along the beach. Of course, they were using beach stones to retain the heat and it took all day. But if you haven't got that kind of time and you can't make it to the beach then this is an excellent way to bring the beach to you. Well, she certainly knows her stuff. That's why her followers have doubled in the past six months. As always, the table setting is just as important as the food. In this case go traditional. A blue striped table cloth and napkins with seashell accents... this meal can get a little messy, if you do it right, so don't forget the bibs. The key is the authenticity she projects. She's bigger than a web series, don't you think? Where did you find her? We met in college. New England, of course? Yale. Excellent. The simplest things can make the biggest impact. Buckets for the shells or a fishing net for a tablecloth. And if you don't have it then ask a friend because they might. And after all, what are friends for? As we say in New England, fun doesn't have to be expensive. Imagination is free. Recipes and instructions for our accessories are on our website. For now, this is Abby Porter, and you've been watching New England My Way. I'll see you next time. And we're out. Nice work, Jacob. Can you get some inserts of the food while it's still steaming? I need this online by 5:00. Sure. Abby Porter, Michael Carrington. Of Carrington Enterprises. The biggest chain of home-goods stores in New England. Like the rads say, 'If it's New England, it's Carrington'. It's nice to meet you. And your enterprises. It's quite the set-up you have here. My mother loans us her kitchen and Jacob handles the video, sound and lights, and Gina handles everything else. Publicity and management, all on a shoe string. For now. But we have big, big plans, and we're hoping you might be a part of them. I'm always on the lookout for new talent and you, Abby, you show real promise. I mean, everything looks delicious. It's a family recipe. An old New England family recipe, yes? New England My Way. Great name by the way. Love it. It's authentic and that's exactly what we're looking for, Authenticity. Well if that's what you're after look no further. Her roots go deep into the Connecticut soil. Abby, you and Carrington's might be the perfect fit. Forty-seven stores, six states, exclusive to our New England community. Together we could create a whole line of home products for our target market. Sauce pans, sheets, dish towels... You hear that? A full line. Your face, your name, in stores all through the north east. Abby Porter is New England. You see, it is that kind of honesty that our customers will relate to. Mr. Carrington, I'm actually from- So where do we go from here? Well, my board and I will be looking closely at your upcoming webisodes so make them personal because it's like I say, if we go into business together people aren't buying your product, they're buying you, Abby. Me? From New England? But you're not from New England. Now, of course. But not originally. I know that, mom. Mr. Carrington doesn't. Are there more albums? No, that's everything I could find. And most of the photos of you as a child have a cactus or a longhorn cattle in them. I was hoping there might be one of a lighthouse or a lobster boat, something I might be able to Photoshop myself into. I know this timing is terrible but I got a phone call earlier from Janet Miller's mother. Do you remember Janet? Yeah, we were cheerleaders together at Langston. Sure. Well, she wanted us to know that your father fell off his horse yesterday. Oh no! Is he ok? Oh no, he's fine. He just hurt his shoulder, but he's gonna have to take it easy for the next week or two and you know your father. Right. That is not going to happen. Is there any chance that you might be able to fly out and help him for maybe a week or two? Mom. It can be so awkward between me and dad. What makes you think he even wants me there? You know he loves you. But nothing I do pleases him. He finds some fault in everything. I think that's just in your head. But if you believe that look at it like a chance to mend fences. Can you go? If he needs me, you know I'm there. That's my Texas girl. If only I was your New England girl. You know I might have a few more photo albums in the guest bedroom closet. - I'll go look. - Ok. Hello? Gina. We need to talk. Well, Texas, I'm back. I hope we're both ready for this. Abby, that's you already. Hey, Dad. I didn't expect you until suppertime. Howdy. You didn't have to drop everything and come all this way. I'll be good as new in no time. I heard a few weeks. What's a few weeks? Come on, let's get your bags. - Ok. - Ok. So, how's your mama doing these days? She's off to a wedding in London. London. What a crazy pair we made. You know, they don't build towns big enough for her. Or small enough for me. It's like you, I guess. You're definitely your mama's daughter. I'm your daughter, too, Dad. I miss you. Yes. I've just been so busy with my new web series. You got your own life. I get that, yeah. Have you seen my show? I- I look in on it. I saw one, it was entirely on blenders. I tell you one thing, you don't do anything halfway. Exactly. So, tell me what needs doing around here and consider it done. Dressed like that? I don't think so. Well, this was just for the plane. I brought plenty of clothes. No really, it's ok. I hired a new ranch manager a few weeks back. He's good. Gets most everything done. At least until I can get out of this contraption. I'm here to pick up the slack, so whatever he can't do you can count on me. Speak of the devil. New manager? New to some. Maybe not so much to you. Someone I know? Dad? Dad? Dad, who is it? Well, well, well. Ryan. Look who's back home on the range. Abby. What a surprise. So your dad didn't tell you? Just about to. How 'bout I give you two a chance to catch up? Well, he didn't tell me you were comin', either. Well, how could I stay away? After his accident and all, so he needs an extra hand and I'm here to help out. What? Oh boy. You're here to help out? For as long as I can be helpful, yes. Ok, so a short visit, then? What's so funny? Look, don't get me wrong, you look... you look great, but you're dressed for a garden party. Well, I just got here. I haven't had a chance to change yet. Well, you've changed plenty since high school. Not much, really. If you say so. Is this gonna be a problem? Us having to work together for the next two weeks? Not for me. What happened between us was years ago. I mean, who even remembers? Well, good. Good then. Well, if you're here to help you can start right now. We gotta get all this stuff out of the truck and into the barn. Yeah. Ok. In a minute. You're stuck on that yellow rose, ain't ya? No. I haven't seen these in a while. Ooh, they're pretty. Did you plant these? Gina? So I'm just off the phone with Carrington. No, what now? See how negative you are? Always expecting the worst. Just tell me. He wants a full bio on you to pass on to his board. One that doesn't mention Texas, I assume. Don't worry, I've got this handled. I'm thinking you were born in Greenwich. Look, he's buying New England, we need to give him New England. Even if we have to stretch the truth a little. I really don't feel good about this. Relax. You'll feel good about the cheques. I really can't do this right now. Bad time? Well, my dad's being sweet but... a little standoffish. His new ranch manager is my old high school boyfriend and I'm kind of stuck at the moment. Hey, I gotta go. Oh, I- I was getting to that. What? I was. Ok. New England will have to wait. I really appreciate the extra hours, Ryan. Feelin' pretty helpless with this arm in a sling. Well, it's nice that Abby's here to help carry some of the load. Yeah. It's great that she's tryin' and all but, I mean, we both know she's more into arts and crafts than ranches. Yeah, she may surprise you. I gave up on that dream long ago. Yeah, well... She may surprise us both. Well... Sorry, I'm late. Just jet lag and all. Hey Dad, I'm impressed you picked up bagels. Where'd you find that? Kitchen counter. Those are suet rings for the hens. Ok. You plan to work in those? What? These boots? What's wrong with them? I'd be willing to bet those boots cost more than my truck. You might be right but I'm good. I'm ready for anything. What's the plan? What can I do? Well, those are two very different questions. I'm gonna check on that heifer that was calving last night. I'm afraid the mother might abandon it. Well, I can do that. You need to be taking it easy. Abby, I said I was gonna check on the heifer, not carry it to the pasture. As a matter of fact, Ryan, why don't you remind Abby how to clean the chicken coop? Hens lay better on fresh shavings. Ok, I think I can still handle the chickens. Just to be safe, let Ryan show you how we do it these days. Word is you're a tastemaker. That's a new one for me. I recommend things. Appliances, bedding, wine. There's money in that? I'm working on it. Alright, well I recommend you let me take care of these ladies. Wouldn't want you to ruin them fancy boots. I'm the one that was brought up on a ranch, remember? You're the one who lived in town. Yeah, well, I got my master's in ranch management. I'm impressed. You're really into this ranching thing, huh? Yeah. What do your parents think about that? They're all for it. They retired to Scottsdale, left me the house. That beautiful old farmhouse? Yeah, I'm fixin' it up. Living there for now. Got plans to move? Alright, now you're just stallin'. No, I'm not. Just tryin' to get to know you, that's all. Get on in there. Come on, you gonna clean this coop or are you gonna clean the coop? I'm gonna clean the coop. Ok, maybe you're right. I didn't dress for this. There's an easy fix for that. I'll take one of everything. Don't joke with me 'cause I'll sell it to you. Janet! Abby! You work here? Worse, I own the place. Hey, Ryan. It is so great to see you. Let me take a good look. So stylish. That's actually why we're here. She needs to get some more practical outfits. I'm gonna go get some coffee at Sam's, but y'all shoot up a flare when you're done. You and Ryan again? Something I should know about? We're just working together for a few days, helping my dad while his arm heals. Not even a little bit of chemistry? No chemistry. None of the earth sciences. So, now can we talk about some real jeans and work boots? You got it. But I wanna hear the whole story while you try things on. There's no story. Is there anything left on the shelves? I just bought the basics. I'm guessing you worked up an appetite on this little shopping spree. Wanna grab a burger on the way back? I have a better idea. You know, a drive-through burger would have been easier. This is easy. It's a classic French omelette. What's the difference between a French and an American omelette? An American omelette is folded. The French roll theirs. Pretty sure my taste buds wouldn't know the difference. Just try it. I added some chilis. Just for a little extra kick. French fusion. Leave it to you to complicate eggs. I'm not complicating them, I'm elevating them. You like it? Where did all this come from? The girl I used to know was all tacos and take-out. I still love all of that, I just like exploring other foods. Word around town is that you were dating a shortstop for the Mets. Very old news. We broke up. He used the wrong salad fork? What about you? After I left I heard you and Cheryl Packer were a thing. Homecoming queen. Well, we went to one movie and then she left me for the quarterback. Besides, I don't have much time for dating anyway. My dad doesn't work you that hard, does he? I'm fixing up my folks' place in my spare time, getting ready to sell. I need a down payment if I'm gonna buy a ranch of my own. Any chance that's for me? It is now. French, huh? You know that? Yeah, it's the way your mother used to fix these. Not half bad. Chilis. Nice touch. Really? You like it? How's the chicken coop comin'? You get that done yet? I had to make a run into town, Abby came along to keep me company. But I'm getting right to it. I hope so. Plenty more to do when that's done. Yeah. You could pitch in whenever you want, you know. I like watching you work. It's something I've never seen before. Besides, I am busy. Something interesting on that phone? Just checking out your website. Ivy league education, summers in Maine. Mmmhmm. A few guest appearances on some tv shows I ain't never heard of. They're big in New England. Mmmhmm. I'll take your word for it. You know, there's no mention in here of Texas. There wasn't much room in my bio. Enough to say you were born in Greenwich? Now see, I thought that miraculous event happened right here in Langston, am I wrong? It's Greenwich. It's probably an autocorrect. Of course, Langston to Greenwich. That's a weird leap. I'm sure you'll fix it. Eventually. Hey, good work. Wish my dad would say that. Nothing I ever did on this ranch was good enough for him. His words? A kid can tell. You know, it was clear he always wanted a son. Or at least a tomboy. Instead he got a lifestyle expert. Yep. I just got a call that the feed order is ready for pick-up so I need you to drive into town. Could you take my truck and gas her up on the way? No problem. You bet. I was talkin' to Ryan. It's a stick. I can do it, Dad. Yeah, the clutch, it's a bit tricky. I drove it when I was a kid, remember? Well, I do now. Maybe Ryan should ride along just to be safe. Whatever you say, boss. You don't trust me? I trust ya. I just don't want what happened to the tractor to happen to my truck. What did I tell you? He'll never change no matter how much I wish he would. Let's drive that truck. I can't believe he hasn't upgraded this old thing. It's ok. Just take it easy. And breathe. Engine off. Alright, now push in the clutch all the way. Start the engine. Now, when you let out the clutch you're gonna wanna give it a little gas. Ok. Who has a stick shift anything anymore? What did I do now? You flooded it. It's alright, just give it a minute. I mean, it's not like we're tying up traffic. Back east there'd be a long line of cars honking their horns at us. Out here it's just miles and miles of... miles and miles. It's so beautiful. It's so quiet. Is this why you decided to go to college in Dallas and not back east? Oh, come on. I never woulda fit in at Yale. Well, I was there. Or was that part of the problem? No. Nah, that had nothing to do with it. I wanted to study ranch management, and you would be shocked to learn how few courses Yale has in ranch management. Still, it would have been nice. Yeah. We were too different. I didn't wanna admit it at the time. Easier to blame me for leaving, was it? No, no. No, you weren't cut out for this life just like I wasn't cut out for that life. Simple as that. So where did that leave us? Stuck on the side of the road, apparently. Try it again. The engine. Right. Yeah, the engine. - Obviously. - Obviously. Ok, what am I doing? - Just push in the clutch. - Ok. Start 'er up. Put it in gear. We're back in business. Some-something important? Maybe. Do you mind if I make a quick stop on the way? Sure, just tell me how to get there and I'll try and get us there. Alright, you're gonna hang a left here. Left. Ok, great. Alright, now as you get up there, you wanna keep going. Clutch in. Brake. Brake hard. Your parents old house. Mine now. Your grandparents built it, right? Mmmhmm. 1932. I gotta leave the key under the mat for a showing later. It's a shame to have to sell. Yeah, well, if I wanna afford my own ranch... Even with that, it'll be miles out of town, prices these days. Isn't that the Blakely's pasture across the way? You have a good memory. He's let it go for so long and he's getting up there in years. I wonder how much that would cost. It's out of my budget. I gotta sell, like it or not. Any bites yet? Not even a nibble. You need a fresh coat of paint on the verandah. You need a really bright colour to make that porch swing pop, patterned pillows, maybe a window box with some geraniums. They love the sun. Can I see the inside? Pretty much like you remember, I guess. Come on. You've been working on this? Not that I doubt you. Yeah, plumbing, electric, that sort of thing. Well, you need to make an impression with what potential buyers can actually see. Have you thought about staging it? Staging it? You could get more than you're asking, I bet. A few easy changes can make a big difference. Like an area rug or some lighting. There's some good furniture stores in Marshall. Can't take a whole day off for that. We'll check out what the hardware store has. Gotta pick up that feed anyway. Hardware store? What are we going to find at a hardware store? Hey, can you have one of your guys load this into Wes Porter's truck? It's parked around back. Thanks, man. Well? What do you think? I think this is not the hardware store that I remember. When did they get home furnishings? Hey, we keep up with the times. Ooh, these Adirondacks would be perfect on your verandah. In Texas? For what? Sitting. And shucking oysters? This would be perfect in your entryway. It could also drain my bank account. We're not buying, we're borrowing. You can do that? It doesn't hurt to ask. Leave it to me. It's what I do, remember? How about "Icy Lemon" for the kitchen? Or "Cookie Dough"? Ooh, I like this one. "Ginger Wasabi". Is this too confusing for you? No, but it's making me hungry. Ok, we'll take two gallons of the "Ginger Wasabi". It's over here. And here I thought you two made a run for the border. Sorry, it took a while. Looks like there's more than feed in the bed of my truck there. Chairs, flowers. Nice rug. Abby's helping me pick out stuff for the house. Wonderful. 'Cause meanwhile two longhorns got loose and went into the neighbour's field again. I'll get on it, boss. Just like I thought. That calf's been abandoned by its mother. We're gonna have to feed it by hand for a while. Abby, you think you can rope him in and give him a bottle? Absolutely. Leave it to me. Ok. You good? Roping was never my strong suit. Just remember to keep your index finger pointed down the shaft of the rope towards the hondo. Hondo? It's the loop the rope goes through. Right. Yeah, it's coming back to me. Yeah. It's not, is it? Not even a little. And then...? Ok. Get your rope... you're gonna wanna really twist your wrist. Ok. And as you start to swing it, right? And let the rope kinda move in your hand. Twist your wrist and swing it. There you go! Swing it. When you let it go, follow through. It's just like throwin' a ball. It's all in the wrist. You got it? Yeah. I got it. Definitely. Ok. Good luck. How hard can it be? Come here, buddy. I'm not gonna hurt you. Just gonna get you fed. Come here. You ok? Let's go. There you go. Find those longhorns yet? Back where they belong. I see you made a friend while I was gone. You don't give up easy, do you? Careful, that is dangerously close to a full-on compliment. We'll have none of that here at the Porter Ranch. Consider me warned. So I loaded all that household stuff into my truck, wondered if you could come by later and help me figure out what to do with it. Tonight? If you can get some time off. I think I can swing it. I'll even make dinner. Am I taking my life in my hands? What's life without a little risk every now and then? How did I ever let that one go? You're right about these geraniums. They really do brighten the place. Just wait 'til I'm finished here. Just a few more touches and then we'll tackle the inside. Ooh, I bet I could do a whole episode on porch swings. We spent a few good hours in that one, if I recall. That seems like so long ago. To me it seems like yesterday. Wine with dinner? I wouldn't say no. It's it's local. I thought you might like it. I don't remember there being grape vineyards in Langston, much less some wineries. There's a few varieties that like the sun and the soil out here. We got it all these days. Stick around, I'll show you. This is really, really good. Well, don't sound so surprised, you might hurt my feelings. What's in this barbecue sauce? It's my grandpa's old recipe, with a few tweaks of my own. You approve? I love it. That is high praise coming from the famous Abby Porter. Not famous yet. And frankly at this point it could go either way. Don't be so modest. You've built a good life for yourself. A busy life. All work all the time. Well, some things never change. High school, class president and honour roll, cheerleading, fashion club... I had forgotten fashion club! No one had ever even heard of that. Not until you started it. And 4H. Well that's only because my dad wanted me to. I tried my best but I was hopeless. Well, you didn't wanna raise livestock so much as dress them. I always wanted to make my Dad proud. Never could. Even now, it's like he wants to connect with me but he doesn't know how. Maybe I can help you change that. What do you say? I say that would be a miracle. I propose a toast. To miracles. Well, somebody's up before the chickens. I figured it wasn't a bad idea to get an early start. Even Dad's still asleep. How about some French press coffee? Is everything French with you? Not everything. If you play your cards right I might even whip up some German pancakes to go along with it. Rain-cheque. Between the ranch and the house these next couple days are gonna be busy enough. Ok, let's get to it. Go on. Shoulder ok, Dad? Oh yeah, better by the day. Don't you worry about me. Ryan. Yes sir. I need you in the north field to check on the troughs. Alright. I'll get on it straight away. Good. And you know, after that I need you to help me patch up that last stretch of fence out back. Dad, what if I go check the troughs. That way Ryan can stay and help you fix the fence and make sure that you don't overdo it. No, honey. It's a good idea, Wes. At least let me give it a try. We can get to the fence that much quicker. It's been a while since I've ridden a horse. I'm sure it's like riding a bike. No, it's like riding a horse. Saddle her up. You sure about this? A chance to impress my father? Absolutely. Wait, Abby! Abby! North field! North. Oh yeah, north. I got it. You think we'll ever see her again? Anybody's guess. She's not one to give up, though. Pretty special kid, don't you think? You tell her that? I really miss this. Who knew? Hello? Radio silence. What are you doing out there? Well, right now I'm on the back of a horse looking at some of the most beautiful land you've ever seen. How about you? Well, while you're playing Texas Ranger we're shooting inserts for that show you wanted to do about seashell wind chimes. These are all starting to look the same to me. We spent the whole morning collecting shells and driftwood off the beach. This is what it's coming to, Abby. Beach-combing. At least if Carrington doesn't see something new online soon. What can I tell him? How about the truth? Other than that. Tell him... I don't know. Tell-tell him I'll have something new in a day or two. I'll think of something. You better, because we've done just about everything here we can do without you. Bye. Ready, buddy? Let's go. Good boy. Let's figure this out. What would Dad do? Wait a minute, what would I do? How's it going, Dad? I'm so tired of fightin' with this thing! Your truck? No, this arm. I never felt so useless in my entire life. Well, you've got one problem solved. I fixed the trough in the north field and a couple more for good measure. Here's the proof. Take a look. Take a look? Well, that oughta work. You know, for now anyway. That's quick thinkin' on your... I got the wrong wrench. I need my toolbox. You ordered gelato instead of ice cream. I was so full of myself. No, you had your own style, that's for sure. And you turned it into a pretty perfect lifestyle. Not so perfect. There's this guy. He owns a big chain of home-goods stores all over the north east. He's interested in the show. He could get my merchandise in all of his outlets. How is that not great news? You read my bio. He thinks I'm as New England as my show. And this guy is all about authenticity. The Greenwich thing. My manager blurted it out and I got stuck with it. What're you gonna do? My mom sent me notes about her childhood back there. Tapping maple trees, beach parties... how can I borrow her memories without feeling like a total fraud? So you reinvented yourself. That's a Texas tradition. You know, you may have more Texas in you than you'd like to admit. Do not let that get around. You know, you might even pass for a local tonight at the barbecue. Last Friday of the month, Fletcher's Barn. Is that still a thing? Oh, it's still a thing. Maybe you'd like to go with me. Maybe I would. You're overdressed for a barbecue. You're underdressed for a dinner party. You can't live in jeans. I don't see why not. I do. Hey, Ryan. Here you go. Spice things up a little. You know we always count on you for this. Hey, I was hoping to see you two. Ryan, tell me you brought that barbecue sauce of yours. Just dropped it off, enough for the crowd. Save me some? I'm having some friends in from Dallas next week and I need to make a good impression. I'll make sure he holds back a jar for you. And Abby, what'd you bring? Clams on the half shell? Oysters Rockefeller? A salad. Kale, bok choy, dandelion greens. With chia seed croutons? You watch my show? Never miss it. It's so good. Hey, you think you could help me with some decorations for the dance at the county fair next week? You'll be there, right? I haven't been to a county fair in years. Absolutely. Drinks. Never thought we'd see Abby back this way again. Yeah, she's helping out her dad for a couple weeks. Right. I heard about the arm. Looks like she's enjoying herself. Pickin' up where you left off? When we left off we weren't speaking. And now? We're speaking. I remember this. The smell of sage brush. I hadn't noticed it. I guess you don't appreciate something until you lose it. I do miss these nights, though. The wide open sky. You always did have two sides to you, city and country. I know, city may have won out but you've got some country in you, too. Hey, everyone loves your barbecue sauce. And you're trying to make extra money. How about selling it? Yeah, I'll hop right on that. No joke. You should think about it. There's no question the demand is there. I don't even know where to start. I can help. Ryan, that's what I do. I find new products and promote them. You could make this a thing. A brand. You can make money off of this. Growing up I spent a lot of time right here on this old family porch with family and friends, curled up with a good book and a glass of mint lemonade. Yes, right here where I grew up. On the old family porch. In Greenwich, Connecticut. Can we-can we just take a minute here? Are you not getting it? No, I'm getting it. I just don't get it. Do you really think someone's gonna buy this is New England? If you come in close and don't show too much, maybe. I don't know what else I'm supposed to do. I have to give this guy something so he can show his executive board. Yeah, you don't give up easy, that's for sure. I know I can be overly ambitious. It gets me into trouble. Do you really think there's something special in that barbecue sauce? Like, something commercial? You'll never know until you try. I could help. If you want, no pressure. I mean it. It's a bit obvious, isn't it? Well, you have to settle on something. You need a label. What about a yellow rose? A yellow rose. That sure says Texas. Ryan? Abby? I hate to interrupt your work there, but did you get today's list done? Already ahead of you, Dad. The cows have been fed and milked. And the herd's been moved from the pasture. Well, that just leaves the west gate that needs fixin'. And Ryan, I need you to bring the tractor in from the pasture. - Yes sir. - Ok. I can do that. Dad, I can drive the tractor. You've been doing too much around here lately and I appreciate it but... how about we get the gate fixed, first. And then we can discuss it? Sure. Then we can discuss it. Did you hear that? He appreciates me. And we can discuss it. Two for two. Progress. Yeah, keep holding it up for me. Do you think he meant that? That we can discuss me driving the tractor? Well, I told you we'd wear him down. Here's what I think. He loves this ranch and he just wants you to love it, too. But I do. I always did, just... maybe not the way he wanted me to. Give it a try. Nope. Not quite. Not quite. Let me try something. What? What're you doing? The lunch I packed. Caprese salad. Sounds delicious, but I don't see how a packed lunch is gonna help us. Tomatoes, mozzarella, basil. And... Olive oil. You travel with your own olive oil? Who does that? Someone who doesn't like soggy tomatoes. I did a whole show about that once. Ok. Alright. Ready? Alright. - Voila. - Ok, alright. - That's... - Yep. That's a new one for me. That's my job and I love it. Helpful hacks for making life easier. Ryan, I know your heart is in Texas. Langston is beautiful. You know, part of my heart is here, too, but... it's so quiet. Don't you ever feel restless here? What, do you think there's nothing to do around here? You might be surprised. Oh yeah? Surprise me. Ok, that sounds like a challenge. It is. You remember the old Garrett place? The old goat ranch? Sure, but I've seen it, you know? You might find it's been built up a bit. Come on. Ok. We specialize in Cabernet Sauvignon but we have several popular varietals these days. Carmen, I'm speechless. Which doesn't happen often. I remember you from school. You were a couple years behind me but everyone knew what a talker you were. And now here's the best part of our tour. And what's that? The tasting. Over the past couple years we've expanded to sales all across the state and we just keep growing. You're amazing. Look who's talking, Miss Internet Star. This is just my little home-spun thing by comparison. Not at all. And that bottling room in the back? Everything's done on premises. We keep our staff hopping, that's for sure. I bet you could bottle all sorts of things if someone needed to do that. Abby. What? I'm just saying. I hate to run but my buyers from Austin have just pulled in. Welcome home, Abby, and I hope to see you both at the fair this weekend. You will. You gotta admit, a lotta change happening around here. Plenty of change. In fact, it's inspiring. Ryan, what's the big mystery? Hang on, we're almost there. Almost where? You gotta see this yourself. See what? Wait, is something wrong? Is it-is it Abby? It's Abby. Like a pro. Hey Dad! Well I'll be. Hey Dad. Did you need something. Just to tell you... good work today. Not half bad. No, better. Not bad at all. You get some rest now. You too, Dad. Thanks, sweetie. Smells like barbecue. Looks like barbecue. I appreciate the interest y'all, but could you give me a little stirring space? A little elbow room? Yeah. Absolutely. You really think this old recipe might be worth something? We'll put a few bottles out for sale at the fair tonight and see what happens. I mean, if we like the reaction then I'll call my publicist, see if we can get it on a national market. That's awful ambitious. Abby's got me thinkin' big. Careful, Ryan. Next she'll have you packin' up and movin' east. You gotta tell me what you think, Wes. Honest opinion. Like a mouthful of Texas. That's good! We could use that in the advertising. What advertising? I might be jumping the gun a little, again, but that's a good line, Dad. You're a natural at sales. Maybe. But for now I should-I should probably stick to ranchin'. What's going on out there? You need a hand? Nothing I can't handle. Hey... Well, when you're finished with this, Carmen said that she'd loan us her packing room for our first run. A few hundred bottles. How much is this costing us? Well, the labels are from my laptop and the bottles only cost a few cents a piece. As far as start-up goes this is pocket change. It's my manager. Hey! Abby, hi! Mr. Carrington's here and he'd like to speak with you. Video call so he can see you. In Greenwich. Here, in Greenwich. Any way we can postpone? Like I said he's right here. Abby! Abby! Apron. Hey, Mr. Carrington! How are you? Good. Hope I'm not intruding on family time. I'm picturing cocktails by the water? That's a good guess. Just back from a whole day of croquet. Just about to mix up a pitcher of Cape Cods. Croquet and Cape Cods. Does it get any more authentic than that? See, this is why we are excited about you. So I like the piece you did on the porch, but all we saw was the porch. We need more Connecticut scenery. More local colour. More scope. Abby, there's chickens all over the place! Didn't you check the pen this mornin'? I'm on the phone, Dad. I'm sorry, did someone say chickens? Bridgeport Bantams. Connecticut's finest. Bridgeport what? And apparently they're all over the croquet lawn. I hate to run but... Before you go, when will we see those new episodes? Very, very soon. Remember, New England scope. I know exactly what you wanna see, Mr. Carrington. Don't let me down. Don't let us down. Thanks for the assist. Yeah, no problem. What was that all about? Does that fella not know where you are? It's a long story, Dad. And honestly I do not want to go into it. Bye. Bye. Can I try? Let's see here. Delicious! What's the sauce? Yellow Rose. It's made right here in Langston. It's like a mouthful of Texas. Well I'll take two bottles. Great. Thank you. You enjoy that! Will do! Tell your friends. What did I tell you? We had 40 cases. Now this is all we have left. Well, if these sales are any indication I shoulda listened to you sooner. You can make it up to me. When we sell out you can show me around the fair. You got a deal. This is one of our newest varietals. I hope you enjoy it. - Hey, Carmen. - Hey. Hi. You know, I I never properly thanked you for all your help with the house and encouragement. Yellow Rose. Well, when I find a great product I need to share it with the world because it's what I do. There you are, Abby! Can you believe the dance floor? I used all the ideas you sent. I know. All of them. At once. Well, they were all so good I couldn't decide, and it all turned out so, so well. You did a wonderful job, Janet. Thanks, but this was all you. I followed your suggestions to the letter. It's really great. Thanks. But don't let it go to waste. Try it out, you two. Once around the dance floor, twice if you enjoy it. Well, you do owe me a dance. How do you figure? You left town before senior prom. I was gonna ask you. But you left me high and dry. You're right. I owe you one. Two if you enjoy it. Is this what it was like? Prom? I wouldn't know. You didn't go? The girl I wanted to go with was back east by then. Well, it's better late than never. You know, growing up here I never felt like I really fit in. But now I do. Maybe this world just needed to catch up with you. I have a confession to make. When I said I had everything I wanted right here in Langston, it wasn't quite true. What was missing? I'm lookin' at her. We're making progress. The place hasn't looked this good in, well, maybe ever. Hey, Ralph. Come to check out the upgrades? It's lookin' good, that's for sure. Wouldn't even recognize it as the same place if it wasn't my listing. You took it off the market, didn't you? He did. But a buyer from Houston was passin' through when the sign was still up, house caught her eye, says it's exactly what she's been lookin' for. Well, it's not ready to show and right now I'm not even sure I wanna sell. She said she doesn't need to see anything more than she can see from the street. She's itchin' to buy. All cash, quick close. Can I get back to you on that? Think fast. I can't promise she'll wait. Alright, you'll have an answer soon. Yep, she's quite a charmer, Ryan. You two make quite the team. Did you taste it? I tasted it, and it's terrific. But it's still barbecue sauce. Yellow Rose. The world's best. What's next? Beef jerky? It's New England My Way, Abby. Not A Taste of Texas. Not a bad name, though, if we ever wanna expand the brand. Good as it is, this is not the message we need to be sending Carrington right now. New Englanders barbecue, too. Please, just show it to him. I'll see what I can do but I'm not making any promises. Thanks, Gina. I think this could be big. You owe me. My manager's going to pitch Yellow Rose to Carrington. So hold a good thought. A linen tablecloth. Fancy napkin folds. Took a few tries. Artichokes, mushrooms, acorn squash, quinoa. I found this little website with all these great recipes. New England something. People should know about it. You even nailed the garnish. Carmen's wine. It was the only logical choice. I agree. Here's to big decisions. And making the right ones. What if Yellow Rose takes off? Well, that's a big "if". The property I got my eye on ain't gonna be around forever. It's a tough decision. It is. But I'm glad you came home. Me too. Mornin', Abby! Hey, Dad! Where's the sling? I woke up this morning and I felt like hey, I don't need it anymore. Look at that. Are you sure that's ok? Oh yeah. I always was a fast healer so I'm back in the saddle. Dad, wait. Don't you think a doctor should look at that? I know my body a lot better than he does. I've been living in it all my life and I'm fine. Sweetie, I-I know you got work waitin' for ya back home. There's no need for you to stick around here anymore. You don't need me? Well, you can stay as long as you want. But, you see, I'm fine. I'm gonna go check on the new calf. Gina? This is early for you. I'm trying to put out a prairie fire that started with your barbecue sauce. Did Carrington taste it? Did he like it? He loved it, but he wondered where you found that in Greenwich. I mean, Yellow Rose? Please. What did you tell him? I didn't have to tell him anything. One of your fans posted on your website that you were in Langston. Carrington started digging... How deep did he dig? All the way to Texas. Fine. So it's out there. Honestly, I'm relieved. We should have just levelled with him from the start. I admit some part of this may have been my fault. Some part? Ok, now isn't the time to point fingers. I still think we can fix this but not long distance. This is a face-to-face problem. You need to get here. How soon? In a language you'll understand these days? Pronto. Is Ryan coming in today? Well, he should be. I haven't heard from him yet. Is something wrong? Gina needs me in Connecticut. Ryan needs me here. Everybody needs ya. Not everybody. Why would you say that? Because everything is coming apart and I'm just confused and I don't even know what to say. Honey. Everything I've ever done I did to make you proud, Dad. Somehow it's never been enough. Is that what you really think? I mean... all these years? Let me show you somethin'. Come on. All these old photos? You think I don't appreciate you? Abby. You-you came all this way to help out even though I know you're not much happier here than your mama was. What do you mean? When we married I asked your mama to move here hoping she'd take to ranchin'. Just like I hoped you would, too. But you are your own person, you see? And I saw that. I always thought you were disappointed in me. Oh, no. I mean it was clear from the start you were never gonna be a rancher. But honey, if you thought for one second I was ever disappointed in you... well, we got ourselves a Texas-sized misunderstanding on our hands. It's my fault, 'cause I had never been, you know, the... the kind of fella who could, you know, talk about his feelin's and such. I need to show you this. All these old photos. All these clippings. Yeah. Even I haven't seen some of these. I've been keepin' 'em for years. Showing them off to anyone who would listen. Honey, I have always been so very, very proud of you. You have? Sure. You were cut out for big things in this world. When you were a little girl you took after your mama. You decorated your room like- like it was a palace and then you dressed like a princess. You see, that you got from your mama. But you're stubborn, like me. Ambitious, too. You go after what you want. Darlin', you're a combination of your mama and me and as far as I'm concerned that makes you perfect. I love you so very much, honey. I love you, too, Dad. Wes said you needed to see me. Everything is falling apart back east. I have to go home and pull it all back together. So you're leavin'. Tomorrow morning. We both knew I had to eventually. At first, sure. But, I don't know, I thought we were... We were what? I don't know. For some reason I thought we had a new understanding. This is my job, Ryan. This is my life. And that life isn't here. Got it. Yeah. This is the same conversation we had years ago. What am I supposed to do? I have to get back there as soon as I can. What do you want? Honestly, I'm not even sure anymore. Well, that's too bad. Because I'm very sure of us and I was hopin' you were, too. Sure of me, at least. I'm in a really tough position. I don't have a choice. You always have a choice, Abby. You just have to have the courage to make it. Me, I've decided to sell the house. The offer was too good to pass up. It was more than I was asking, thanks to you. Ralph's bringing the papers by tomorrow. I can finally make that down payment on some land outside of town. I'll be just fine. That's something I never doubted. So this is it. Well, we had a good run. Twice. Like the first time, I wish you nothing but the best in the world. We can't leave it this way! Sure we can. Truth is I should have moved on a long time ago and I truly thought I had. But these last couple weeks I let my guard down and I fell in love with you all over again. Nope. That's not it. I never stopped loving you. Ryan. Goodbye, Abby. You've reached Gina Mosley Productions. Leave a message and I'll get back to you. Gina, I've been trying to reach you. Where are you? Call me. I hate to see you go, Abby. Me too, Dad. But I have to. How'd you leave things with Ryan? Not good. I thought you two had a real chance this time. My show's in New England. I thought the internet was everywhere these days. It is, but New England is only in New England. I'm gonna miss you. I'm gonna miss you, too, honey. Looks like we have a visitor. Jacob? What in the world... It's not just me. So, this is Texas. Is this why I couldn't reach you at the studio? Mr. Carrington. Hi, Abby. I'm so confused. I told you he loved the Yellow Rose. And I do. And, ok, he was a little disappointed you weren't as authentically New England as you'd let on- Gina. As... I let on. My bad, I admit it. I'm a terrible person. But I still like your style. And I think you have a wealth of knowledge and I would hate to see that go to waste. Your Taste of Texas idea? He loves it. He wants to expand his company. We're always looking for the chance to take our brand national if it's authentic. It's authentic. This is where I come from. These are my roots. My real roots. This is my barn, my cows, my chickens... and this is my dad. Wes Porter. Howdy. You the fellow who's been givin' my little girl all the trouble? Well, I think it's the other way around, but I'm not here to argue. Fair enough. We could have done all of this on the phone. What're you guys doing here? We're here to shoot the pilot. Jacob's got the equipment and you've got the location. And I've got the money. Don't you just love the sound of that? Jacob, go find some good angles. Think scope. Right, Mr. Carrington? We want scope. Well, what're you waiting for? Go change! I love this. - This is fantastic. - It's perfect, isn't it? The lot. This is exactly what we're looking for. Scope. And action! Don't adjust your screens. "New England My Way" is moving. We're live streaming today all the way from my home town, Langston, Texas. This is where I was born and raised. This is the land that I know best. Better than the beaches of Cape Cod or the maple forests of Vermont. And together we're going to explore it all. Hey, hello. Ryan? It's Janet Miller. There's something you need to see. Ok, yeah. I'm kind of in the middle of something here. Just need your signature on these pages and we'll get things rollin'. Yeah. Can I call you back? You could but it might be too late. Are you near your computer? A friend reminded me recently just how amazing this part of the country is. How much it has to offer. Well, it turns out my heart is here in more ways than one, and sometimes you just have to follow it. The sky goes on forever here. The air is filled with the smell of wild flowers and sage brush. There's just nothing like it. That's Abby Porter, isn't it? What's she talking about, her heart? I don't know but I need to find out. It got me so excited that I wanted to share it with all of you. So it's time to get reacquainted, and in my mind there's no better way to do that than over barbecue. Ribs and lobster. New England, meet Texas. Texas surf 'n' turf. Woah, Ryan. The contract. Just leave it on the table and lock up when you're done, ok? And we're out. That was brilliant. So easy, so natural, and that sauce is a product I can sell. So do we have a deal? As long as we agree to all be entirely truthful from this point on. Cross my Texas heart. I didn't tell you that my grandfather was from Texas, did I? No. He's not, I just wanted to make sure I didn't say it. I think we both better keep our eye on this one. This lemonade is terrific, by the way. It's bottled just down the road. Fresh local lemons. Might make a show on its own, you think? That I will leave up to your daughter. Yeah, smart man. We haven't had this much traffic here in years. Can we-can we talk a minute? Is that the old boyfriend? Yep. And I'm hoping the new one. I I was watching your show just now, Yellow Rose and all. What's going on? My plans changed. I'm not going anywhere. What about New England your way? The great thing about a website is you can run it from anywhere. My dad reminded me of that. So the deal's off? No, it's on. And better than ever. We're re-branding. A Taste of Texas. And we'll shoot it right here in Langston. So you're staying? Yes. And Yellow Rose is the first product we're promoting, so I hope you haven't signed the papers on the house yet. Not yet. I don't wanna make promises I can't keep, but with time this could amount to something. Maybe even buy that land across the road. But I have one more idea. Oh no, should I-should I duck? What if your ranch was more than a ranch? What if it was a destination? A guest ranch where people from all over can come and see all the wonderful things that you and I love about this place. The old west meets the new east. What do you think? I think I'd need a great designer. Lucky for you I happen to know someone. Lucky for me. Now this feels like home.
