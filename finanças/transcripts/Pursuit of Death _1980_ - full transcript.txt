Jagko Hey, you. Hey! Get up, get up. What are you doing sleeping here? Are you sick? I asked you, are you sick? Sick? I'm always sick. Let's see some ID. What kind of ID would a homeless man have? - Follow me. - Where? There's a place where they house people like you with nowhere to go. They feed you and give you a place to sleep. - Get up. - Where is that place?

Production: Kang Dae-jin Director: Im Kwon-taek Why are you guys smoking in the room again? If you keep breaking the rules, I'll stop distributing cigarettes from tomorrow. Prefect! These men will live with you in this room starting today. Look after them until they get used to it here. The inventory staff is out, so help them get their uniforms tomorrow. Yes, sir. Come over here. First let me tell you the rules here. We get up at 6. At 7 we wash and clean the room. At 8 we have breakfast, and at 9 we're allowed free time. From 10 to noon we help with maintenance work and sunbathe. Then it's lunch. From 1 to 3 it's rest and laundry time. From 3 to 5 we get some more sunlight. At 5 sharp we have dinner. From 6 to 8 it's free time. Quiet! And then we sleep. Now, you may not leave this building, no matter what. Be quiet when you are indoors, and report any problems directly to me, the prefect. Never disclose anything to someone outside. If the person next to you does not get up in the morning, shake him, and if he doesn't move, come look for me. - Do you understand? - Yes. Come here. I'll assign you to your places. You stay here, and you go over there. You came to the wrong place. This is a waiting room for the dying, all waiting for the angel of death. We're all losers who have been abandoned and isolated by the world. It'll feel stuffy and boring, and for a while you'll have a headache. Of course, it'll be better than dying on the streets. We still get to go out sometimes, don't we? Go out? - You mean we can't? - Look here. Unless your family or friends come to get you, once you're here, that's it. What do you mean? I mean you can't get out before you die. What the hell? Come over here. Here! - What's wrong with you? - I'm getting out. I'm healthy, I can't rot in this place. - Let go! - Where do you think you're going? I'm leaving on my own two feet. Why won't you let me go? - What's wrong with you? - Be quiet, will you? Have some respect for the sick! A person's dying here. What are you looking at? Where the hell do you get off disturbing a sick person, you bastard! Jagko... You're Jagko, aren't you? You're nuts. Jagko my ass. Then I'll call you Baek Gongsan. Baek Gongsan was born at 54 Jinwon-li, Jinwon-myeon, Yeonggwang-gun, Jeonnam Most recent known address is the same. Real name: Baek Gongsan, a.k.a. Jagko. Job: blacksmith. Date of birth: December 29, 1925. Education: none. Jagko's crime: After the war broke out in 1950, he joined the communists in Jinwon. As their agent he distributed weapons he made in his shop and slaughtered hundreds of innocent people. That same year on September 28, when the South reclaimed Seoul, he passed Ssangchisan. On the 29th, went to Jirisan as a North Korean partisan. As head of the "Jagko" unit, he committed brutal atrocities such as massacre, plunder, and arson. He attacked police stations and bombed bridges. Arrested on July 30, 1953, at around 4:30pm, right after the ceasefire, he escaped while being transferred to prison. Description: Height: 5 ft 5. Dark eyebrows, large wide eyes, thick lips, rectangular face Son of a bitch... like you're some kind of detective Anything unusual: One side of his nose is higher than the other, and there's a mole on that side. Based on this evidence, Jagko, you're under arrest. Retard . Anyone in the market with a beard must be your grandfather. - Stop fooling around! - My stomach, my stomach. - I'll tie you up. - He hit my stomach. My stomach, it hurts. What? You'll do what? - Isn't this a crazy bastard? - I have more evidence, you fool! Since your eyes can see, take a look at this. You know what this is? Where'd you get that dog tooth, you loony. This tooth is the one I put in to replace the one you broke when you butted me with your head and escaped. Use your glasses and look at me straight. You've lost it, and you've lost your manners, too. You're saying I'm crazy because you have been caught, but it won't work. When does a mad man admit he's crazy? No wonder I had a bad dream last night. This loony's come out of nowhere to mess with me, damn it. Well I'll be damned. This one's crazy. I tell you, he's nuts. Hey, you all, I am not crazy. This man is a red guerilla who got away in Jirisan 30 years ago. I was a policeman in the manhunt at the time. This bastard's accusing an innocent man... Hey, loony, my name is Kim Samsu, and my hometown is Yeosu. I once heard that Yeonggwang was near Hampyeong, but that's land I've never set foot on before. This one's completely insane. - Completely insane. - He's crazy. I thought there'd be some peace, since one of us died a few days ago. It looks like trouble because of him. They say unexpected things happen when things are about to go wrong. - You still insist I'm crazy? - What the... You bastard. You son of a bitch, where are you going? You bastard, you coming onto me now? It's meal time. - Gather in front of the building. - Yes, sir. - Come on, hurry up. - My glasses, my glasses. You may eat, but it probably tastes like dirt. Of all people, this guy comes to sit next to me! My food! That bastard can eat a hundred bowls a day and still he'll never be full. - Prefect. - Yes, sir. This man just barged in saying he wanted to meet the director. What did you tell him? He keeps saying "a red, a red." Who is this red? - Actually, he's this. - What? Then you should've assigned him a guardian! Sorry, sir. - Make sure you keep them under control. - Yes, sir. - Take this, you bastard. - Come on, he's crazy. From now on, whoever you meet, you go through me. - You got that? - Yes, sir. I put it on the counter, but when I was handing out the food, it just completely disappeared. Who on earth took it? Search every inch of the barracks immediately and find the knife! - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. Take another look at that man over there. - Is there any reason why we should? - Yes. He's a bit weird. I'm sure he's the one. - What do you mean, weird? - He's insane. You don't know what he might do. Where did you put it? Hand it over. I won't even step on a shadow if it belongs to someone else, and you call me a knife thief. Cut my stomach open if you must! This's boring. Change the channel to something else. - Let's watch a drama, a drama! - Okay then. Honey! Honey! Honey! Can't you take those sunglasses off at least when you come home? They scare me. Think of how scared Manseok must be. Do I scare you that much? They do say the red guerillas will bolt upright in their sleep just at the thought of me with my sunglasses. Look at him. You recognize your papa now, you cutie. - Hello there. - Oh look here! - It's Giyeol, isn't it? - Sure is. How have you been? - Look at you, a successful man. - Brother-in-law! - Brother-in-law! - How have you been, Sister-in-law? - Hey, Giyeol! - Hi! Giyeol, it's been ages. - I heard you got promoted to sergeant. - That's right. Let's have a drink and celebrate. Are you crazy? The old landlady's going to talk. Turn off the TV and go to sleep. I bet you can't sleep with me in here. Don't you hear the gun shots? I'm sure you're thinking about back then. Jo! What are you doing? - Shoot to the left, to the left! - Yes, sir. What are you doing? Chase them! Turn around and spread your arms and legs against the rock! What? Who's this? - You're Jagko, right? - No, no. One nostril is higher than the other and you're still not Jagko? - Jagko's some place else, sir. - Fine. I'll bring a witness. Bokman! Hurry over here and take a look at this guy. He's Jagko, right? Go! Hurry up and go, you bastards! Go! What are you doing? We don't have time. Hurry up and push them in. Hey, you... you get in there. The enemy who killed my father! Son of a bitch, I joined the police to catch you. - Die! - Are you crazy! You can't kill him. We're supposed to take them alive. This one's Jagko. I caught him. In the end even the notorious Jagko gets caught by the hand of Sergeant Song. I'll take this bastard in myself. Are you sure you don't need anyone to go with you? Don't worry, Commander Shin. - Who am I? - Okay. Then we'll continue searching in the direction of Saetoe. Take him straight to headquarters. Yes, sir. Hurry up and go, will you. I'm too hungry. I haven't eaten anything these past few days. Won't you help me fill my stomach with some water? Me... you say I'm the last? You're the last one with a reward on his head. Come to think of it, I lasted quite a while. Son of a bitch, does that make you proud? Do you know how much time was wasted and how many soldiers were deployed just to catch you? When I think of that I'd like to put holes in you, but I'm holding back. I'm pretty dogged, but you're quite persistent and tough. Didn't you know I was a tough one? Indeed you deserve credit, Sergeant Giyeol. - What? Sergeant Giyeol? - Sorry. I called you by your name. Then again, you wouldn't be real if you didn't know Song Giyeol. - You've achieved quite a feat. - Sure. It's too complicated to count all the bastards I've caught and shot. - Good for you. - Are you teasing me? Go to hell and tell them to try me in the people's court. When a man who barely finished elementary school becomes sergeant, that tells you something, doesn't it? I suppose you'll be promoted again because of me. Isn't it obvious? Once I transfer you to headquarters, it's good-bye to this Jirisan once and for all. I'll go and get myself a position as chief of a police precinct somewhere. - What will happen to me? - You don't know? You'll be executed. Get up. My stomach! What's with the sudden bullshit? Get up. - Let me shit somewhere. - The regional headquarters is near. Just hold it till we get there. It's urgent. It'll come out any minute now. - Just loosen the rope around my waist. - Shut up and keep going. Can't you help me out? I'll give you some gold. - What? Gold? Where? - In my shoe. - What? - This side, this side. You sly bastard. - Let's take a look at this foot. - There's no more. I told you, no more. Cut the crap. - Where did you get it? - In the village... -when we were struggling for supplies. - Son of a bitch. A ring on your toe when others can't afford to wear one on their finger. You think Song Giyeol will fall for this kind of stolen good? - I'll seize this. It's stolen property. - Seize... There's nothing I can do. But what about this other urgent matter? No one can go to the other world or the bathroom for you, so all right, I'll let you go. Son of a bitch! You can say I'm crazy all you want. Anyhow, your life is in my hands. Prefect! Prefect! Do something about this maniac. Do they let maniacs sleep anywhere they want? A man's got to get some sleep to live. What's the matter with you again? Hey, look here. Go back to your place. Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption. Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, This isn't the first time you've seen a dead body! If you're up, hurry and wash up. Come on, hurry. Come on, get out. Hey, Chungi! Chungi, come over here. Over here. Here, cigarettes, three of them. You know that guy with the glasses who came in yesterday? - Huh? - You know, the loony. When a quiet opportunity comes, I'll pick my right nostril with this finger. You take his glasses and grind them with your feet. Got it? Okay, then show me. Yeah, that's it. Remember: not when there are people around. Do it when just the three of us are there, okay? Chief Ham, please come immediately to the office. Chief Ham, please come immediately to the office. Chief Ham, please come immediately to the office. - Doc, we have a mental patient. - Is that so? - Is it the old man over there? - Yes, it's serious. It's hard for us old men to handle him. His report from the police hospital didn't mention mental illness. They probably didn't know. I'm so nervous about what he might do, I can't live. At present, all the rooms are full. There are one or two mentally ill patients in each room. There's nothing we can do in these circumstances. Give me some more medicine. I gave you a week's worth. Taking more drugs won't make you better. How are you? Are you feeling better? It's not like I'll be cured. Can you just change the gauze again? - I followed orders. - Dress it again. What does he have? He has diabetes, and on top of that, he had his appendix removed, but it seems the wound is not healing well He developed complications and has an abdominal infection. He could die any minute. - How are you? - I'm always the same. There's just one thing I'd like to ask you, Doctor. What is it? I'd like to donate my eyes when I die. What should I do? - Your eyes? - Yes. My eyes can still easily thread a needle. That's an admirable idea, donating your precious eyes to the blind. - Please help me. - All right, I'll let you know if its possible after consulting the hospital. We'll have to examine your eyes and see if they're suitable for donation. - Anyway, please let me know. - No way! I don't know about anyone else, but not him. - What the.. - He can't, never, no way! If those eyes go to someone else, that man will become another Jagko. No, you can't let him. Those eyes are the eyes of a murderer and a red. No! As long as I'm here, never! No! You can't! No matter what! My glasses, my glasses! That retard. Hey, you bastard, you bastard! You bastard. What are you doing, you bastard! What are you trying to do, destroying a man's eyes like that? Chungi, you bastard! I told you to do it when I picked my nose like this! Why'd you do that in front of everyone! Gather around! We're going to do maintenance work, so except for those who can't move, everyone gather in front of the flower bed! And the newcomers who came in yesterday, follow me. Come on. What are you waiting for? Hurry up! Ah, nice. Bathhouse What is this you're doing? - What are you doing, eating mercury? - Let go. Let go, Let go of me. Let go. I'm going to die. - Jeomsun. - Let me go. - Jeomsun, you're not alone. - I said let go. - Our child - Let go. Is in your stomach right now. - Let go, let go. I can't, but Jeomsun, you go down the mountain for our child's sake. They say you can live if you give yourself up. They say there's a ceasefire. It's all over. A liaison officer for the federation, and a partisan. How could I live even if I turned myself in? If I try to go down the mountain, the people here will kill me. Even if I do make it down, do you think the people will leave me alone? I'll die the same wherever I go. Anyhow, follow me. They're surrounding us and are up to the rocking stone right now. If we stay here, we'll both die for nothing. Come on, follow me. The Oepari unit was smashed, and they're being chased this way. There's nowhere to run. We'll have to die fighting. Fuck, even if we wanted to fight back, we don't have any ammo. If you get caught, follow them or kill yourself with that. You choose. Hey, you! He's he's a communist, a red! - Are you going to answer for it if you lose him? - What's wrong with you? - Let go. Are you going to answer for it? That... - Come on! Let go of me, let go! Hey you, you! Come over here, over here. What are you doing? Stay put and don't move. I'll kill you if you come out. - Mother. - Who is there? Mother. - Go... Gongsan? - Yes, it's me. - You heartless child. - Mother. They say everyone who went into the mountains died. Where did you hide during these 5 years? I worked as a farmhand in the leper village in Samwon-li. Oh, you poor thing. They say even birds keep away from the leper village in Samwon-li. I couldn't stand it any longer and decided to escape to the North. I wanted to see you one last time. This boy doesn't know anything about communism. Forgive him. Gongsan, run! Run! Run away, escape! Run! Precinct station. The chief just got in. Yes, I'll tell him. You, come over here. - Hello? - Where did you get this gun? - This is Kim at the precinct station. - Who's this? Yes, yes, that'll be fine. - Isn't this Bokman? - Sergeant Song! - Good to see you. Got promoted, eh? - It's been about six months. Guess what? I arrested Yuksoni of the Yuksoni unit. - That's how I got promoted. - Good for you. - Have a seat over here. - Sure. - Sarge, where did you get this gun? - In the mountains catching guerillas. You know at that time it was finders keepers. You probably know this, but you can't carry illegal weapons. I'll have to confiscate this. Why didn't you report Jagko when you found him, and let us catch him? Why did you have to be so rash? You know my story well. Didn't I lose my job and get my wife killed because of him? Sarge, you haven't had breakfast yet, have you? Let's go out and eat. Officer Kim, get me Daeseongbok on the line. - Daeseongbok is on the line. - Okay. Madame Jang? It's me, the chief. I'm going to bring a guest, so prepare breakfast. Okay? What? It's still morning and you're fussing with me already? You want to get a taste of me later? Hello. Hello, sir. - Brother-in-law! - What? Oh... Sister-in-law. You got married! Well, it has been 3 years. He's a handsome babe. Where have you been without a word? I had a subordinate named Bokman, who was way too young. One clay he was all bragging and rude while buying me a meal just because he'd become successful, so I beat him up. Thanks to that, I've just come back from spending 3 years in jail. How could you be so unlucky! - How's my Manseok? - He's dead. What? How? Nephew, I don't know what to say. You know how cold it was last winter. Despite the cold, the young one stood on the caldron every evening and just waited for ages for his father to return. One clay, wouldn't you know, he came home, his body on fire. We gave him medicine and did all we could, but he made no progress. He died in three days just waiting for his father. We let such a poor child die. There was no way to find you, so we just laid him next to his mother. Well done. How did it go? They decided to take them out as soon as I die. Kim Samsu, we took a good look at Song here today. He's not crazy. The red guerilla he's looking for is you, Baek Gongsan, isn't it? What kind of joke is that? You all know my history well. When the reds attacked the South in 1950, I boldly joined the army. I fought the enemy at the Nakdong River until we reclaimed Seoul. After the ceasefire I was discharged as a decorated first sergeant. This grand history of mine. That's what we thought until now, but after listening to Song here, that doesn't seem to be the truth. What? Then are you saying you'll report me or what? I will. After all, that's my responsibility. - You're accusing an innocent man. - Stop it. We're all dying anyway. What difference does it make now if we're a red or a guerilla? We could die any minute now. What's the use? Make a sound and I'll kill you It's been 30 years now. We're both as good as dead. What the hell are you going to do? - You need to go with me somewhere. - To the police? To the commander who dismissed me. You have to go and clear up the false accusations against me. Get out right now. Commander, I'm being falsely charged. I didn't do it. Even though there's evidence to prove it? It doesn't make sense that you lost Jagko! Look at my tooth. As I said, that was an intentional trick of yours to set Jagko free. What do you mean a trick? The head office said they wouldn't make a big deal out of this, considering your accomplishments in the past. I'm sorry, but you have to go. I had no idea you were that kind of person. How am I going to live? It's so embarrassing to see the neighbors. What? When did I ever ask you for a gold ring? How could you lose your mind -over such a ring? - Shut up. Give me a drink... a drink... You can't even sit straight. Why do you keep asking for a drink? What? Are you looking down on me because I got fired? - My gosh, what are you doing? - What's wrong? - Why are you meddling over here? - Calm down, Sergeant Song. Sergeant? Are you making fun of me or what? - Oh Lord. - What are you doing? - You came to the right person. - You're lashing out on the wrong man. I'm a bastard who's just hit his wife, my wife, who I've never laid a finger on. What's wrong? Calm down. - I said calm down. - Brother-in-law! Brother-in-law, it's serious. - Sister fell in the well. - What? Sister. Honey. What are you going to do? Go to my wife, explain that I'm innocent, and ask for forgiveness, or do you want to die here? I guess I did too many things to you that I shouldn't have. I'll do whatever you tell me to if that's what I have to do before I die. Good, then let's escape from this place right now. How are you going to escape? First of all, the front door is locked with double locks. - Shut up. You can open that, Jagko. - How? After you ran away from Sokcho, you made keys in Cheongju, Chungcheong-do. You're really something. Okay, then. How are we going to climb over the high fence? What's a fence when we can work together? True. That is true. Like we couldn't climb over the wall. But on weekdays security is tight. On Saturday, there's some space to breathe. Then some guards go out and they get a drink. Saturday is three days from now. Okay, let's do it then. But it looks like I'll be in a tight spot until then. The people in our room seem to be onto me. Think they'll keep still? Get up! Get up! Hurry, hurry, come on, get up! Hurry! Everyone, I would like to explain to you that Kim Samsu sitting here is not the guerilla I'm looking for. First, Jagko, the man I'm looking for, not only has a different personal background and details, but his description, especially, is where I was greatly mistaken. Jagko's nose goes up on the left side, but as you can see, Kim Samsu's nose goes up on the right side like this. That's what's different. Second, the critical mistake in my investigation is Kim Samsu's left hand. Jagko's left hand has six fingers, but Kim Samsu has a normal hand with five fingers. Based on these various facts, I would like to clearly explain that Kim Samsu is not Jagko, Baek Gongsan, who I'm looking for. I sincerely apologize for having worried you and for having disturbed you all this time. And also, I sincerely apologize to Mr. Kim, who was almost charged unjustly because of me. Kim, I'm sorry. - Aren't you going? - No, I have a stomachache. Three meals are all we look forward to here. Try to eat even though you're sick. You go ahead and eat. I'll go when I feel better. - How're you feeling? - I'm better. - You already finished your meal? - Yeah. - Eat this. - Isn't this an egg? They only give you this once a week. - Eat up. - Thanks. You'll need your strength if we're to climb the wall. - Hey, Song Giyeol! - Yes, sir. Why did you break away from the group? You're supposed to wait for everyone to gather around and then return. I wanted to get Kim Samsu his egg. Shut up and sit down. Yes, sir. - Hey, hey, tuck your leg in. - Yes, sir. Tuck it more. The weather outside is gloomy. Why doesn't somebody sing a song? Who wants to sing? Hey, Sebsebi. Why don't you start, Sebsebi? - Come on, clap your hands. - Sure, I'll sing. In the flowery breeze when people sell and buy love... All people praise God, the root of all blessings... When you leave sick at the sight of me, I will let you go quietly. Let me pluck an armful of azaleas from Yaksan in Yeongbyeon... In the mountains, flowers bloom. In the fields, flowers bloom... My poor body. In search of what did it wander the endless paths of my dreams? Good, well sung. Why don't you try this time, Kim Samsu? - I'm out of numbers now. - How about your favorite? Tell us again about the incident on the east coast. - Yeah. - Yeah, tell us. Okay, then. since you all want to hear it, here goes. Now, it was the summer of 1958. I ran a gold mine in the mountains, but the mine collapsed, forcing me out of business. I, Kim Samsu, went bankrupt and was wandering here and there all alone when I arrived at Sokcho in Gangwon-do. It was squid season at the time, and they needed a lot of help. I happened to get to know an old fisherman and helped him with the squids. The old man happened to have a beautiful daughter named Hwasuk. She had a kind heart and a kind body. She was simply a beauty. One clay Kim Samsu didn't feel well and stayed at home. On that particular clay, the old lady was out, and in the empty house there were only Kim Samsu and Hwasuk. As if things were destined to happen, an opportunity struck. Are you badly ill? Here... try some. What are you doing? What are you doing? After that the two lived together for three years straight, and day and night it was blissful heaven. - Don't leave out the part where you got kicked out. - Right. It was 1960, the year the April 19 Revolution broke out. That day Kim Samsu and Hwasuk were once again wandering through heaven. - Let me see. - Stop pushing. What are you kids looking at? Get out! Shoo! What are you two doing day and night cooped up in that room? For crying out loud, I'm so ashamed I can't live. - Hurry and get out. - Come out here at once! It's too embarrassing to see the neighbors. I can't live. - What is this all the time? - Come out, now. Come out! You won't come out, eh? You're driving me insane. You mindless girl! Kim, you come out too. There's a limit to my patience. Pack your things and get out now! Eventually, Hwasuk and Kim Samsu got kicked out. They rented a house and started a true life together. The secluded fun was as sweet as honey. For a long time, we were together, unaware of the passing time. Excuse me. Who is it? Oh.. I'm a friend of Baek Gongsan. - Baek Gongsan? - I'm an old friend of Jagko's. Is that so? The place is humble, but come in. - Come on, come in. - Well, then, pardon me. - Is it a boy? - Yes. - His nose is sure not his father's. - They all say so. Why are you looking for the boy's father? I was wandering here and there looking for a job. I heard that Jagko had settled down in Sokcho, so I thought I'd come looking for a job. I'm sorry. The smell is horrible, isn't it? Do you have a rag? - Here. - Thank you. By the way, is he out somewhere? It's been 6 months since he left home, but he should return since the day after tomorrow is his birthday. Is that so? Then I guess he will come since he has such a handsome boy here. He'll come, he will. I'm sorry to have troubled you when we've just met. I'll come back when my friend returns. Where will you go? I'll stay at an inn nearby. Why waste money on a room? We have an empty room, so stay here. Ma'am, where's the bathroom? It's right around the front gate. Sleep here. - I couldn't. I'll go over there. - No, you can't. That room hasn't been heated. It's too damp. You can't sleep there. - Just sleep here. - I couldn't. I don't mind. I can sleep anywhere. Why not? You're his friend. I suppose your wife and child are waiting for you at home? No, I lost both of them early. - It must have been lonely by yourself. - What's the use of mentioning that? - Indeed, I've been lonely too. - What do you mean you too? You have Jagko and your child. From the beginning, I don't think he ever loved me. A child without any love? It's not like you can't have children without love. What kind of a man has no courage? - He's not going to come. - Not going to come? After the May 16 Coup, they told us to file our resident registrations. He left to get a copy of his family register from his hometown. I haven't heard from him since. That doesn't mean he won't come. After all, he has a child. - It's not really his kid. - What? Then this child. Whose... He knew long ago that it wasn't his boy. Fuck. What are you doing just leaving like this? Where will you go in this rain? Look at me, look at me. Hey, hey, can't you hear me? Are your ears going deaf now, too? - Why don't you sing a song? - I can't sing. If you can't sing, then tell us about how you broke your leg. Sure. - Can I straighten my leg? - Sure, okay. While I was looking for Jagko, I saved up little by little. With that money, I opened a bar on wheels at Cheonggyecheon. Every year I sent rice to a person in Jagko's village, my informant. At last, he gave me some news. He said that Jagko had been wandering about the village when he returned after his mother died. I rushed over to Yeonggwang immediately. I'll give you all the money you want. Just take me to the next station. - Did you miss your train? - Hurry up and go. Okay. - Where are you going? - A shortcut to catch the train. That... that driver... Step on it! We might lose him. He saw me! I don't think we'll make it. The engine's too hot. Here, here, take it, take it all and step on it. Step on it! We have to catch him. - Hurry. - I can't! We can't go any faster. The engine's too hot. You still can't? I became lame because of Jagko, and my body grew old. After losing all the money I had, I was completely broke. Cheonil Inn This money won't do. Go sleep somewhere else. It's so cold. Where will I go? Just for one night? I skipped dinner to save up that money. You shouldn't ask for the impossible. Who told you to keep pestering me? If I had any money, why wouldn't I give it to you? - Just don't say the room's cold. - Of course. - Follow me. - Thank you. - Fill out the registration form and put it outside. - Okay. Really! Honey. Honey. Honey. - What's that? - Rat poison. Instead of living through such pain, let's eat this and die together. What're you saying? They say living's better, even if you roll in dog shit. Just think it over for one more day. For people like us, one day is the same as another. Are you scared? If it's what you want. If it's what you want, then I'll go with you. Innkeeper! Innkeeper! Someone's dying. - What? - Someone's dying! - Which room? - This room! This one! - What the.. - In here. Has this bitch gone mad, trying to ruin someone? - Hey, you! You in there! - Open the door! Oh my God! My God! These bastards. What is this you're doing? Trying to kill me? You had no place to die, so you had to come here, eh? I don't believe this. This is killing me. You, Jagko! Hey, really! What the hell, my head! Are you crazy? What are you doing? What's wrong? My head! The world must be crazy. Catch him! Catch him! Catch him! Catch him! After I lost him, I searched everywhere, but I never saw him again after that. When I think about it, I could devour his liver, but it still wouldn't do. Hey, Sergeant Song, what happened to Jeomsun that night? Do you think she survived after eating that strong rat poison? - So, she died. - How could you let her die? After all, she was your woman. I knew her in the mountains, but we parted when you swept through them. I never heard any news of her after that. You old man, are you crazy? Go find someone else. Just my rotten luck! What a lousy start! Like this is something to bargain for, asking for a bargain... Why don't you rest a while? Now that I'm old, no one bothers to look at me. Just give me what you have. Jeomsun, aren't you Jeomsun? You didn't die. You're alive. By then there wasn't a single part of her body that wasn't ill. She was an alcoholic and had VD throughout her body. She was practically dead. I did everything I could to get Jeomsun out of that alley. Then, one day, she said she had something to tell me in private. I followed her without a clue. - Don't. Please don't drink anymore. - Let's just have one drink each. I'll never touch the stuff again. Here. It's a disease that can't be cured. You've gone through too much trouble because of me. Why are we here? What's wrong? Will you hold me just once? We can't. It's worse than drinking. - Hold me, hold me. - We shouldn't. We can't go on hiding like this forever. I know. We've come to the end. There's no way to go. Then what do you want to do? There's only one thing we can do. You have a plan? - What's that? - Rat poison. Instead of living through such pain, let's eat this and die together. What are you saying? They say living's better, even if you roll in dog shit. Just think it over for one more day. For people like us, one day is the same as another. Are you scared? If it's what you want. If it's what you want, then I'll go with you. Truly, there's nothing harder than a person's life. You ran even after you ate the poison. Did you want to live that bad? I got diabetes because of that rat poison. They cut open my stomach, and I'm suffering because I got an infection. It would have been better if I had died then. What's a human life, that I still want to live? Eat up. What are you going to do if you don't eat? Here, drink some more of this soup. Thanks. - Why don't you eat my food instead? - Thanks. This disease doesn't know when to stop, no matter how much I eat. The countless feet of aggression that trampled the Korean peninsula. This isn't simply the 36 years of oppression by the Japanese. U.S.-Soviet Summit If we look back on history, it is no exaggeration to say that... U.S.-Soviet Summit ...our country has survived our brushes with foreign powers since we... Turn the TV off now and go to sleep. If we look at specific cases, those not based on ideology... If what they say is true, you and I are pitiful people. Why am I pitiful? Cut the crap. - What the hell's wrong? - Get up. - We have to go now. - We agreed to go on Saturday. - Get up when I tell you to get up! - Okay, okay. Now, open it! Put that knife away. Look, I'm obediently following you. Aren't you curious why I said I'd donate my eyes? To tell you the truth, there are too many things I never saw, because I was in hiding. So even if I die, I want to let my eyes see the world to their heart's content. Son of a bitch. I was so single-minded in finding you among all those people that my eyes got sick, you bastard. Look here, let's die well. I mean, at least when we die, let's go in peace. What are you going to do if you put me on the scaffold now? Stop the bullshit. Fuck. How come I was born with such a grim fate? My life's about to end now that I've spent my whole life in the shadows. Hey, let's stop and rest for a minute. - You think this is Jirisan? - I can't go any farther with this body. - Kill me or let me live, as you wish... - Stop making a fuss. My stomach. I'll kill you, I'll kill you. What are you old men doing? This man's a missing guerilla. He's a missing guerilla whom I've caught after 30 years. Don't you know what a missing guerilla is? It looks like these men are patients who've escaped from the asylum. Look at that. Isn't that the rehabilitation center uniform? If we take them to the precinct, they'll send them back to the center. - Just call the center and tell them to take them. - I'll do that. Hurry up, come on. That way goes to Mapo. You said we had to take the train at Seoul Station. This way. - Really? - This way. Come on. Get on. Sergeant Song, how long has it been since you returned to your home? I bet you have a lot of people to greet you. When you're born a man, it's no good committing a sin. When I die, I want at least to be buried in my hometown. But even I know shame. I just can't go. The End
