TILL MARRIAGE DO US PART Paris, April 20, 1920 After this sad day, I will write no more on your pages. My Journal faithful companion of my labors. Today he is dead in the cemetery of Père Lachaise my last hope to find my true love. From the window of my Parisian room, ... I see the tower from which I will take the big leap, ... forever closing that brief earthly chapter called life. My painful story began twelve years ago in my beautiful Sicily. Come, come! Please don't cry! This is a wedding, not a funeral. Sit! As you can see, the father, despite having been invited, has not shown signs of life. - Maybe he's dead. - He's not dead ... ... because his debts still accumilate. And in a big way! No more bets! No more bets are allowed. - I'm good. - Me too. - No more bets! - A Letter to the Marquis. - Where does it come from? - In Sicily. - Throw it to the basket. And I sent telegrams to all the sites that he usually ... ... uses in his depraved life. - A telegram, Marquis! - Next, later. So I have gathered the family council. What is it a wife says, before she gets closer to the marriage bed? What would you tell your mother, who unfortunately no longer exists? She watches from Heaven and takes care of everything. Oh, I know! She handles listening and all, but she does not speak. And you, Excelsa, who have been her second mother, you know what your duty is. I do not understand what you saying, Monsignor. A young woman can not marry without knowing ... those things that neither I nor the Mother Beatrice know. And I know even less, please. - A young ignorant wife is the best catch. - You, shut up. - Is aunt Clorinda still alive? - If she has not been eaten by the mice ... To my knowledge, begging for food daily. - Magnificent. She will do. - How I envy her! - I'll never let, never. - not to a young virgin , the sinner! Just because I've decided. Aunt Clorinda will do very well. Her sins have been purged and her experience will be helpful to Eugenia. Aunt ... Aunt Clorinda Clorinda Clorinda aunt ...... How beautiful you are! You look like a lily ... ... virginal lily. Will you let me hold you? Why are you crying? Today I'm so happy, everybody cries. One day you'll understand. Sit! That's it. Now I must talk as a mother. I must educate you. It is necessary that a mother, on the eve of the wedding ... ... talk to her daughter. The Little Sisters of Carmel have educated you ... ... to know the mysteries of soul, but not of the flesh. So do you want me to tell you? I had not yet turned 30, ... we danced the waltz. He was very handsome and strong ... ... and the ecstasy of music, I did not realize ... ... took me far outside under the moon and with the scent of orange blossom . And that was, when I layed down and I surrendered. What next? I felt something so delicious and divine , .. like fire invading me. And then blood, lots of blood. Now you know everything. Go, my daughter and God protect you. - that's it. - Thank you, Aunt Clorinda. What did she say? She has told me everything, but I understand very little. Praise the heavens! The whole town and all the nobility ... crowded that day into the convent chapel where I grew up. It was for me a marriage of love. At the foot of the altar I saw the man that I loved, ... and although he was handsome, rich and young ... ... he had a commoner name. Kneel! Raimondo Corrao, will you take as your wife ... ... Eugenia de Maqueda, according to the rite of the holy and Roman Church? Yes! Eugenia de Maqueda, do you take as your husband ... ... Raimondo Corrao, according to the rite of the holy Roman Church? Yes! - But if it is broken. - It isn't; it is well. - You, shut up. - Why? Because this is the hole for the head. Come on! Hurry up and do her hair! What is it? Be gentile with my child. Come, my little girl, come! Eugenia! - Take off your robe. - Why? You must be tired. - A little. - Then let me. Lie down. Where? ... In the bed. And you? Me? Here, beside you. The sacrament we have received makes this necessary. I know. May I kiss you? Let me kiss you! No! What who is it? A telegram. An urgent telegram. Pass it under the door. Ah, Aunt Clorinda! Come here! - Come here. - Not yet. Why? - Read this! - Who sent it? - Apparently your father. - then he is alive. Where is the mirror with the Caryatids? In there, why? "In the name of God, don't consumate your marriage." - What does that mean? - It means that someone wants to have fun with us. It is usually done on the wedding night. I did it too, When I was a student. As this is probably a joke "Remain pure and pray. Stop". "The news of your wedding came too late. Stop." "You must be like brother and sister. Stop." "In the double mirror backed with Caryatids... ... my diary is hidden... ... with an explanation of the misrepresentation of your birth." "Signed, your father, Ruggero di Maqueda". - Fast: get me a hammer and chisel. - What orders, Excellency? Fast: a hammer and chisel! The husband needs a hammer and chisel! The Husband needs a hammer and chisel! Fast! - What? - The husband needs a hammer and chisel. It was true! It was not a joke. My God, what a shock! The hand writing is my father's. You read it, I cannot. "Dear Eugenia: " There will come a day when you will have to read these lines, "... if I have the courage to give them to you. "It was the year 1886 when I embarked for Africa, "... a the conquest of colonies for our beloved homeland "In Sicily leaving my beloved Floridia, who had recently become my dear wife, ... and that was not even your mother". - Floridia - Yes mother - Do not stand spellbound. Think about your Ruggero, Because when the flag reaches Eritrea, the war will be over. War? A walk through Africa, as the paper today says. "Luck was adversely affecting our hopes of victory. " And I would never again have seen my beloved Floridia, "... if God had not put by my side a man ... "... although commoner, he was gifted with great sacrifice and an indomitable will. ... Antonino Corrao, my assistant and faithful guardian of our stronghold." He's wounded. Bring a stretcher! Mission accomplished, sir. Thanks, Antonino. He was wounded and barely alive. "As I was nursing back health... " ...We had spent the better part of our life with our centenarian aunt Cristina di Cefalù. "Who did not cease with her antics, even after her death. "She now threatened to deprive us of our immense wealth, ... we all waited with impatience." ... a Dalbella Carolina. As regards to my lands: ... if that useless Ruggero is not able to give the Maqueda... ... family an heir within the year following my death... ... They will go to the pious Convent Sisters of the Sorrowful Mother. I see the wife blushing. Perhaps the heir is already on the way. Unfortunately it was not. In this place of pain that was the Campaign Hospital, I got the following telegram: "The ministry grants you license to return to the homeland ... "... in order to obtain an heir and thus save your power. Signed heritage. Ettore Uncle". Drink Don Ruggero. This is the blood of our land. May God bless you, Antonino. I think I feel a little better. Take a look, Antonino. It seems it has ceased to ooze. Yes, It is much better ... ...My legs seem better. Sometimes I feel a sharp pain in the groin. Pardon my ignorance, what is the groin? My dear and faithful Antonino, The groin in the educated speech ... indicates that part of the human body, where the balls hang. Do they hang there for you, Captain? The hand of an enemy who does not deserve to be called a man... ... had deprived me of my masculine attributes. - Refers to the mustache? - No, the beard! Meanwhile, accompanied by my faithful Antonino, ...I prepared to return to the motherland. What would you think if we did a trip to Lourdes? Don Ruggero, the only trip I've taken is this ... ... to Africa to make war. What is this place of which you. Speak? It is a famous holy place with a miraculous pool, ... where bathing, the crippled walk... ... and the blind recover their sight. But Don Ruggero, cripples have legs, ... the blind have eyes. Unfortunately the day of my return had arrived. I was triumphantly welcomed by the entire population, ... but I trembled at the meeting, in the privacy of the night ... ...I would have with my beloved Floridia. My Husband! Allow me. I've waited so long. - Take me; I'm yours. - Yes. Oh, Ruggero mine! Ruggero! Antonino! Run! Don Ruggero feels bad. Here, here, in his bed. - There, there! - There, there! - No, here! - There! There! - you here! - There! - Ruggero! - It hurts. "Again, Antonino had saved me. " Under the pretext of ill-health, I made him sleep beside me, "... even though at that time he had a wife and grown child called Raimondo ... "Me. that's it for me. I'm lost. - How are we going to be brothers, if we have a different father and mother? - We will know soon. "I lost all hope of doing my rightful duty as a spouse... - What duty could my dear father - not take? Do not ask, kidy listen ... I had to resort to a stratagem worthy of Boccaccio". How am I going to listen, if you read so quietly? I fear there are things that you should not hear.. ... or know, or understand. Sandman Made with chamomile. THE WAR OF GALIAS Julius Caesar Oh! Mission accomplished, sir! I'm afraid ... tonight ... I hurt. - But I see in your face that it has not. - Huh? How I wish it were night again? What Yes? - My respects, Dona Floridia. - Morning, Antonino. My respects, Don Ruggero. "That's how he found out about Floridia's deception and was destroyed. " Nine months after that fateful night you were born, my dear Eugenia. "I rewarded Antonino with a large sum ... " ... and he went to live with his family. "Your mother could not bear the pain and soon passed on to a better life. " With my money and other perks that I had used to buy his silence, "... Antonino was becoming richer and could send his child ... "... (ie me) to study the Escolapios. "With the passage of time, Antonino, became more daring and insolent, " ... knowing that he had saved our heritage. "But a banal hunting accident ... ... did justice to that superfluous and arrogant character." Your father is offensive to me, ... I could not forgive him if he were here present. "Embittered by many humiliations ... " ... I left the island, and decided to never return. "I trust the kindly Sister of Dolores, knew nothing of the deception. "But if one day you find Raimondo Corrao's the son of Antonino ... ... you should know that he's your brother." Sister! You're my sister! And you're my brother! Damn! Damn! Damn! Damn! What a cruel mockery of fate! Raimondo, my husband! - Help!, aunt Cesca - What are you doing Where you going? Help me. My husband has fainted. - Sorry! - But what have I done? What have you done? What have you done? On the wedding night the husband can never feel bad. If anything, it is the wife who feels bad. Although between us that can not happen. Why? Explain, because I'm confused. Eugenia, why are you so beautiful? - I do not know. - You are mine and I can not have you. In what sense? I do not understand. For a brother can not sleep with his sister. It is prohibited by the laws of God and men. We will have separate the beds, what harm is there in that? The Sacred Rota then is void while the marriage is unconsummated. - There has been no intercourse. - Intercourse? He has thrown mud on our family honor. And mired me with dishonor, I have been cruelly humiliated. If you do not take into account the inheritance of Aunt Cristina which would go to the Sisters ... No, no, no inheritance. Only death can wash away this shame. Whose death? Yours. No, mine ... or both. No, not mine. Not mine, because I see the headlines of Sicily: "The best of the island Suicide on wedding night." "The bride was not immaculate" questions arise with or without them. No, no, no. As for yours ... "A young noble family Suicide on wedding night." And whose to the wiser, eh? "Questions about the manhood of marriage." Question marks or exclamation ... No! No and no! Already I hear comments in the circle of nobles: "Don Raimondo could not." For me, its not enough to just to look at you! Raimondo, are you sick? Can you get help? answer me! Now am able to look at you. - Raimundo mine! - call me brother. My brother, you were afraid of committing an insane act. An insane and unnatural gesture: ... A base and impure desire. Now I can look at you serenely ... and give you a sisterly kiss ... ... on the forehead. You have been granted a grace: ... the grace of purity and abstinence, accompanied by ignorance. - Nooo! - Yes -. Then, I can never know the mysteries of the flesh. - Never! We had to keep up appearances. The next day after that night ... unhappily ... We left our palace to begin our honeymoon. - In here, Please. - I don't wish to disturb you ... Excuse me. Allow me: Raimondo Corrao, Marquis Maqueda and Castelvetrano. Baron Henri de Sarcey, Knight of the Legion of Honor, - ... Engineer French Railways. - Enchanting Lady, I'm honered . - I'll stay as little time as possible - Why, Baron? I do not want to disturb the privacy of a couple on their honeymoon. - How did you know? - Obviously, I read it in his eyes. I bet you are going to Paris. Yes, but after that we will visit Rome, Naples and Florence. Discovering that this unknown visitor looked so intimatly at my body ... ... filled me with shame. And at the same time, I confess, gave me a chill of insane pleasure. What is it? I do not understand. A herd of cattle is blocking the tracks. It is unthinkable! The locomotive has had to stop the train and wait... ... for a herd of cattle to cross the tracks. Excuse me a moment, dear. I will go see. Excuse me! Excuse me! My husband is interested in everything. But he has a real passion for trains and locomotives. - however I have another passion! - Once, during a railway strike ... ... He drove a locomotive to Messina. It was his first time, but he did very well. Since then has that passion for trains and locomotives. He says it was a great experience. - I also feel a passion It is intoxicating. - Oh yeah? What? Beautiful women, like you. There are soldiers herding livestock. - Take my advice. - which one? Have fun in Paris. I know the fate of the Sicilian woman ... ... all day stuck at home, all her life, surrounded by children ... ...always in mourning for some distant relative who died many years ago. - Of course you discribe me. - In Paris I know ... - Dantesco! A farmers strike. We will die of hunger and thirst for all they care... ... all those loose cattle. The Army had to intervene. People are taking to the river ... ... so they can drink. - That's cruelty! Yes, strike, strike! In my country, the miners refuse to extract coal. I say unto them, you go down to the mine, so we can have fire. Without fire, there is no bread. A pair of shootings and a couple of dead farmers and order would be restored. I hear that you like to drive locomotives? A famous monument of Gothic art. very well. What is it. - Those are not ours! - Flowers! Who has sent them? An inner voice was telling me. Him! It could only be him! "This modest tribute to the Marchioness of Maqueda ... ... no but its signed Paris. "And since Paris is a female Mr. Marquis does not offend." Baron Henri de Sarcey " Why the subterfuge? - Do you feel ill, ma'am - No, no, no . Take them out of here, out, out! What? She rejects my flowers? Its alright to put them in water . What a pleasure to see you again! I heard of your arrival and wanted them to welcome you to Paris. Is the lady tired from the trip? - Madam, are you not feeling well? - It's nothing, do not worry How happy it made me to have a pretext, ... a momentary indisposition not to go out that night. However the next day when we toured the city, he came with us. He seemed to have something else on his mind to disturb my already fragile existence. Wonderful! An impressive realization of human ingenuity! A powerful edifice In life you must to be bold throughout. -. Euge 'Eugenia - The elevator is full - I'm here - Eugenia - How stupid. -! Raimondo Raimondo -! Eugenia I'll wait for you on the ground Come, come.! Let's take refuge here. It is useless to wait in the rain. Come in, please come in. I love you! Where are you going? One more word and my suicide will weigh on your conscience. I was just looking at this wonder of modern technology. - Let's go; the darkness overwhelms me. - Yes, let's go. I do not think this show is suitable for a lady. Please, sir. - Good night, sister. - Good night, brother. From now on, we will only visit the churches and museums. Being exposed in public like that, shameless! Where is society going? That woman is naked and the men are dressed. what does it mean? It mirrors the truth; Truth is always naked, don't you think, madam? Ah! Here's the landscape that has served to inspire many true artists. I felt faint, but I tried to remain strong. I invented several excuses not to go out more. But none of the pious readings he had given me ... ... my dear Monsignor Pacifici, ... were taking my mind off of these horrible thoughts ... which now besieged me daily. Raimondo and Henri had gone that day to a stable,... ...where Purebred horses were sold. What, who is it? Enter! I can not open the door. It is closed and locked. Who is calling? Tell me. Eugenia? Hello? Eugenia? Why don't you answer me? - Hello? Eugenia? - Oh, my God! - it's me. You who? - I, Henri. - I'm alone here. Raimondo's is out. - I know, he's busy with the horses. I want to see you! ... alone. Allow me that grace. I have not slept since I met you. And I love you, Eugenia. - No! This is Insane! Get out! This is Insane! Get out! Behind the hotel is a large garden, the Palais Royal. Meet me under the columns, to the right as you enter. - Never! - You are not happy Eugenia... I know, I can see it in your eyes. - Are you a happy, Eugenia.? - No. Yes, yes, yes, yes. But you. You have made me unhappy, I need to talk to you. Yes, you are the most beautiful woman I've ever seen. - Your husband, he only loves Paris. - Shut up. Raimondo may come back at any moment. No, he is very busy with the horses. Never! I'll never come! I'll still wait for you my love. My mouth had said, "never," but all my soul trembled with desire ... ... to meet with this man, that showed me so much love. My sinful turmoil almost served as my consolation ... ...I knew that the door was closed and locked by Raimondo, ... Before, it had filled me with anger, but it now gave me security. Oh, Pardon me, Madam! Our eyes meeting, that look! It seemed to me as if the priest read the bottom of my soul. I saw in him a pious hand being offered to a castaway. - Do you speak Italian? - I speak Latin. I understand a little Italian. Tell me, tell me. Father, I have sinned greatly with desire. - Do you want love? - Yes, Father. That's not bad. I absolve you. I have not done anything wrong! - Who opened the door? - The Maid. She came to clean. I just stepped out for a breath of fresh air. That's all ... I just got curious. - What right do you have to lock the door? - The right of a wise husband. You're not my husband! No I'm not your husband, but I am your brother. A lady does go out alone in Paris. Where did you go? I have been dishonored, both as a brother and a husband. - This is an nteresting trip, huh? - A little bit. Do you wish that you were back home? A little bit. This is a souvenir of Paris. - Your kindness confuses me. - Excuse me, madam. Do you know who built the railroads? I'm friends with everyone, ... even the Minister of Transport. and I have a proposition to make. That's a shame, we have to leave Paris tonight. Precisely, dear friend. But, I have a nice surprise for you. Tonight, a ride aboard a locomotive, "The Raffal" It's the fastest of France. 120 miles an hour. And, I have a special ticket for you. It will be a wonderful experience. Do you mind, my dear? Huh? No, no. Stronger, faster! Quicker! Quicker! Go! Feed it, feed the insatiable monster separating man from the elements! Again, Again! Excuse me, sir, may I? THE PARISIAN LIFE Who is it? Eugenia, please open up! I have come to give you some company. - I have brought a bottle of champagne. - I can not. Why not? Just a little company. Only some company. That's okay. Okay, I'll wait. Hear the fun your husband is having! We should also rejoice. We can spend another day together, can we not. - No! - An unforgettable night then. - No! - You will have a beautiful memory. - No! - The memories we will make. The desire, Eugenia. no! Let me caress her naked body. It will be my paradise ... .. and perhaps for you. Scoundrel! Can't you hear? He is also as happy as we are. "As the turbines are expanded, advance O people - the big Satan." Carducci, the great Italian poet. Carducci! Here's to love. Perfect! Like a Russian. But you have to be careful not to get cut by the glass, little one. Be well! ... Try once and then die. Die? Why die? I offer you my virginity. Please don't make fun of me. - Virgin? You are still a virgin? - Pure as a lily. What about your husband ... not yet ...? He has not touched me, not even with a finger. My God, how complicated you Sicilians are? Stendhal tells how an Italiaan husband ... trusts his wife to be a virgin .... ...but always checks to see if it had been otherwise. Ah, no! No, no, no. Who understands the Italians? No, It's all too complicated for me. I'll leave the champagne. Goodbye, my beautiful one! In hindsight, a virgin is too tiring. No! I want to die! Conductor! hurry, Conductor! - What is it, madam? - She drank a bottle of quinine, magnificent ... hair lotion. Oh! She'll be alright. - Is she traveling alone? - No, her husband is driving the locomotive. Oh! How well paid these French railway workers are! Making an attempt on life itself, Thats crazy. Why? Is chastity, for you, too big a burdon? Many hold holy chastity to be a blessing from God, ... for you is it too much to handle? Read, read in the book that I gave you for your wedding, ... with joy they accepted martyrdom, to preserve their virginity. "Quick and merciful will be the eternal joy" ... screams in her heavenly exaltation St. Apollonia, Virgin and Martyr, ... while being torn on the wheel and then thrown into the fire, ... thrown to the beasts. And this is key, key, ... that after rejecting marriage to her beloved Tamiris, ... she did not hesitate to face with no more dress than mystic ardor ... ... a fierce attack by a pack of tigers. I'm too weak to face the dangers of the world. What is Weak? Were the eleven thousand weak, yes, eleven thousand virgins captained by St. Ursula ... ... who preferred death to carnal acts ... with a horde of lewd heartless brutes? Or Agatha, the chaste maiden who preferred the amputation... ... of her breasts rather than give in to the wishes of the shameless Quintian. There's an army of virgins and martyrs watching you and judging you: Filomena, Margarita, Martina, ... Bibiana Barbara, Dorothy, Christian, Dorothea, Sinforosa. But what I say, all these martyrs, but unfortunately are not virgins! Turn to prayer and good works! The spirit dominates contrition and body fatigue. Now get ready to return to your palace, ... like a normal happy couple. Yes, yes, we will love but agree with purity of spirit, ... but if we sleep in separate rooms. What will the servants think? I don't want people to whisper behind my back. Do you understand? Very simple. We will just say that you have taken a vow of chastity... ... according to the Rule of St. Augustine. That's a great idea. PRAYER OF A VIRGIN Good night, Raimundo! Good night, Firmino! - good night. - Joyful night, Aunt. I've heard a rumor that you had decided... ... you and my cousin Eugenia, to waive the shared bed. Yes, that we have. That's crazy! With a woman like that! Abstinence is sometimes more stimulating than the pleasure. Has it not happened to you, cousin, to see that a flower, one of many such beautiful, - ... that seems to me to say: "Don't pluck me, don't pollute me." - No! "But she seems created just for making love." Gabriele D'Annunzio. PLEASURE, Chapter 3 - Gabriele D'Annunzio? - The greatest Italian poet. I do not read his books. They are banned by the Church. They are immoral. "Only by overcoming the moral, you can approach the man, Superman". THE TRIUMPH OF DEATH. Preface. The decision is sacred. She plays for you and you love her. I love her, yes, but can desire her no more. "The love I feel is one that is forever and does me no harm." "Maybe yes, maybe no." Book One. "Accept the unknown and all that fate brings." "He liked to call his sister: lover". "Eliminate any prohibition and your will nearly have the flavor of incest." Hush, hush, hush! My God, what am I doing! Do you wanted to kill me? "Desire and destruction, will and suffering are the same fever. " Maybe yes, maybe no. " Paper first. Yes, also the crime is justified, when you have very strong emotions. My only vice. Goodnight, cousin. And read the poet. Now comes the Marchioness! The Marquise! Come on, boys, do not bother the Marquise. - Behave yourselves. Do not make a fuss. - There is something here for everyone. That's for you. - Kiss your hand. - Are all these children yours? -...Just because I havw seven and another on the way? I brought you some clothes. I have dedicated myself to do charity work in order to master my carnal desires. To facilitate these outings, ... Raimondo had Turin bring a motor vehicle. - Al Convento de la Dolorosa. - At your service, Unfortunately Marquise, he comes with the car, he's the driver and a mechanic. He was a Tuscan named Pennacchini. A man who at first glance seemed competent and able in his station. However, I increased my prayers to ward off new temptations. - Take me to the Palace. - Yes, Marquise. There was a foul odor emanating from his person. A vulgar smell and yet very exciting ... which he knew how to get rid of. - Madam? - Please close the glass. A worker sweats. Tomorrow I want the car washed and buffed. As you wish. And make sure you wash it well. So I will. PLEASURE THE VIRGIN OF THE ROCKS. THE INNOCENT MAYBE YES, MAYBE NO I would like to get in the car. - Why? - I would like to try it out. - Get in then. - Really? - No, I'm not going to. - Why? - Because if the Marquise sees me, she'll fire me. - Fire you? - Is the Marquise so cruel? - Not cruel ... she's very nervous. - Every since the day of her wedding. - Things have been a little off? What have you heard? That she sleeps there and he here, eh!. But I will say no more. Hey you, listen! Our patron and the Marquise have vowed after the wedding ... ... to practice "marriage chastity" yes. So when they die, they will be saints. - When they die! And for now ...? - You must not. Maybe I'll be here a while. I'm in no hurry. You, God, praise; you, Lord, we acknowledge. You, Eternal Father, all creation worships you. Consider yourself fired. Of course. Even my French Perfume... ... wont get rid of the pungent odor of that violent commoner. The motor has failed. It will take a couple of oxen to tow the car. What do we do? There is a cottage. Do you see it? Its hot out here. Maybe we'll be cooler inside. A glance, eh? Lie down. You will see how soft it is. It is better than a bed. -Are you going to take advantage of my weakness? - Yes! No! No! don't. No. No. No. Give me a hand. Help me a litte bit! Please No! Please NO. Enough! I can't do it. I'm too tired. Don't quit! Don't at last! If you are a man of honor, leave the island tomorrow. I'm not a man of honor. My God, how could I stoop so low! Vile, vile, vile You tricked me! The engine was't damaged. What? You didn't like it? You will see that tomorrow things will be better. Come on and get in! - Here comes the Marquise Eugenia. - Yes, let's give her the news. Yes, go faster. Out, out of the way. Doña Eugenia, your husband is a hero . You know that for ten days, the mine workers were on strike, ... egged on by two or three ringleaders. This work stoppage was causing serious problems for your husband, .. not only him, but for Italy itself at this time of war. Well, he decided to end the strike. Don Raimondo assessed the situation like a general on a battlefield. Thus, with a slow but steady pace, enduring the scorching sun... ... indifferent and unarmed, he advanced towards the group of mutineers, led ... ... by three or four outlaws, who would be better off behind bars. Lieutenant Carabinieri ordered his men to aim their weapons. But Raimondo, seeing such movements, indicated with his hand that it wasn't necessary. Go back to work! You must fulfill your duty! After a moment of uncertainty, that seemed almost eternal... ... the mob of miscreants faltered and slowly dispersed. They returned to the mine and back to work. The strike is over. Forgive me, cousin. I'm so excited that I must retire. Wash me, cleanse me, rub me! make me spotless. Purge me! Harder! But, lady, if the gown is not removed there is no way to do more. Have a bath naked? Never! You know how the saying goes: We are born naked and we will die naked. - naked and washed. - you do not consent to such comments. I had better shut up. Harder! Harder! Purge me! Harder! Harder! Purge me! Purge me! Take off my nightgown! - Never! - Obey! - Okay. Lady Marchioness, May I say something? The dog that cut off your dress, must be a very gentle dog ... because he did not leave a scratch on the skin. Cleanse me, wash me, rub me. Fast! Purge me! Cleanse me, wash me, rub me. Have you heard of my feat? Clear. I've never seen you more beautiful. - what did you do today? - Nothing! Seeing the cabin again, a storm raged in my poor heart. Would the chauffer stop... ... or not? He didn't stop and I almost felt disappointed. Carry on. Do your duty. Go inside! Here I am, I'm inside. Really? Don't you feel sorry me with my consumption and despair. I have not seen a tougher skin than yours to still have a mother's heart. What does my mother have to do with this? I thought we came here to fuck. Eugenia, if you faint! Hey, baby, Awake! Look Let's go, huh? It takes two to fuck. Wake up, you know little about love Some cooperation is necessary. Today is going to be better than last time. I'll send you to paradise. But undress by yourself, huh? - Make it good and then I'll die. - Why? - Because I do not want to live. You will see that you will soon lose the desire to die. - No, I dare say. - What? I would like to start again. Give me your hand. Put it here! Do you see how the little one is? kiss Me! Big again! So these are the mysteries of the flesh! These and many others. The desire too. Again, again. Can we do it yet again? Is it possible? "I sail the sun with a south wind, dreaming Duilio colonies." - "What will open furrows with your spurs!" - Who are these verses? - the greatest poet of Italy. - (Dante) Alighieri. - Gabriele D'Annunzio. Unjustly exiled to French soil. - where he fled from his debt. - A genius does not pay his debts, Msgr. - My respects, Msgr. - My respects, Msgr. His books are banned by the Church.

See how the Divine Providence fixes everything? - Tell me what he said? - Cover up. - You're not my sister! - Really? Your father is not mine. My father is yours and your father is mine. Cruel mockery of fate, I am deprived of a guilty pleasure! We are husband and wife, just like any normal couple. We needed more excitement. - We'll have to look elsewhere. - You're crazy! It's poisoned. Calm down. We will not die. - And the poison? - its only a Parisian powder. - Parisian Powder! - A vulgar aphrodisiac! Infamous! Vile! Scoundrel! - Are you crazy? - I want to die and you will die with me. - Be careful what you do. - I'm doing it on purpose. - You'll burn the house down. - That's what I want. To burn up the whole world! And the world burned literally .... ... and all burned at the stake. War will be for us the scent of battle. War will be the virginity of victory. Now, war will be your mother. She who helped you to take your first steps; ... She who wiped your first cry; ... She who you consoled, counseled, and forgave .. ... She who delivered us to the war launches us ... ... and then she will yell, "Go, son . Go and die. " And the plucking of your breasts, sends you into the fight, ... saying, "Go, son You can't be overcome, resign, or die. " Mother, how ominous! There will be touched balls.

Instead, I'm here and he is not. He was given a medal. So he must have died happy. Who knows if I'll get me a medal? Because if I die, I'll have failed... ... and no one wins. Nurse!
