Look at the Blu-Ray one. Whaddya think of this one? What're you doing? Hello, I said, what are you do... - Stop lookin' at me. Gonna get me caught up. You finding everything okay, ma'am? - Yes, I am. Thank you so much, Chip. You have a great selection here. Thanks. Hector! You pendejos give a whole new meaning to the phrase "quality family time". - Mr. Traiman left early? No goodbyes? - In the way he explained it to me, he had a two o'clock tee-time. Looks like he left the keys to the kingdom without making the proper introductions, which means I'm Hugh. - Chip. You manage another store? - Arden for two years. - Arden? Who'd you piss off to get transferred to the 'hood, bro? - Maybe it was a promotion. Maybe I'm just that good. Maybe they sent me here to shape up the squares that they don't think can cut it. - You're messin' with me, right? - Yeah, I'm messin' with you. Hey, do me a favor. My account's updatin'. I need you to log me in so I can tally up these a.m. receipts. - Sure. - Almost had you. You shoulda seen your face. - I'm a fan of the classic toaster, let's get that one straight. A toaster is like a bike. Gets you where you need to go, A to B, white to wheat. - Spare us the up-sale and the jokes. That one. Don't even think about it. It's the same model I got when I was married. - It's a nice model. The base model definitely works, but it's kind of a personal tragedy to let you guys cling on to such outdated technology. You know, a lot has changed since Nixon was President. - Nixon? - You know, my grandma would side with you. Yours is a generation I respect. - I'm 49. - Yeah, I'd agree with that assessment. - You'd agree with what? That I look old? - 'Scuse me, sir. There's no running. - Front store! Now! - Oh, my God, Cindy, he has a gun! - Okay, let's check out the car stereo section while our friend vacates. - Hey, watch them. Got room for one more. - What, are you gonna stick a PlayStation up your ass? You got so much shit under your shirt you're the one that looks like it's pregnant. - You really gonna talk shit right now? Just have my back. - Oh, okay, I'll have your back. You know what? Fuck the PlayStation, and just get a big TV for me. Take the floor model, huh? Put it up your ass. And if they say something, we'll just tell 'em you got hemorrhoids. Take the-- Come here! - Yo, dial 9-1-1. - You, come here. All right, listen, tell you one time only. Oh, shit! - Where you going? Get to front. Get to front, now! - Chill, homie. - Now! - Okay! - Yes, I said the Leisure Guys Electronics Store. The Florin Mall. This bitch wants a fuckin' address. Just trace the fuckin' call! I am calm. I told you, there's a gunman in here shooting. - Multiple gunmen. - Multiple robbers! We don't know that they robbers. - Do you wanna do this, huh? - Hang up, somebody's comin'. Hey, you! What you doin' here? - I'm just helpin' the customers. - No, no, please, please! - Move! - Please don't, no, no! No more hiding. No one need to die. Anyone move, you die. Anyone look at me, you die. Anyone speak, you die. - All right, mother fucker, we get it. We take a shit, we die. Why don't you just take the money and get the fuck outta here? When I marched with my father in Mississippi, the Klan had guns, too. They didn't scare me then, and you don't scare me now. I think you knocked him unconscious! Good, nigga lucky he not die. - There's no need for that kind of talk! - I'm chink, too! No different. Neither of us have chance in United State. We shoot someone now. No. - No, no, no! Manager. Where manager? Where? - Oh, fuck. Me. I'm in charge, I guess. Okay, okay, okay, okay. - Safe. Where is safe? - I have the keys to the register. - No register, safe. Real money. - I don't know the combination to the safe. - Manager have key to everything. - Okay, look, I lied, all right? I'm not the manager. - Where is he? - I don't know, man. Maybe he went for lunch, or something, okay? I promise, I'm not the fuckin' manager, and I don't get paid enough for this shit. - Fuck! Lock the door. - Okay, whoa. I'm lockin'. - Lock them now, or I shoot the kid. - I'm doing it as fast as I can. Loi. - What you want? - I have to pee. - Get on the fucking floor. You have four second. One. Two. Three. Long. 9-1-1, what is your emergency? - Okay, we take control here. We want police department. I'm in control. - Ma'am, I'mma need you to move. We need to keep this area clear. Hey, do we know anything yet? - You know all the entrances and exits in this place, right? Yes, sir. - Okay, I want you to stay close, all right? Gotcha. - Kapinski. - Detective Rick Gomez. Hostage Negotiations. - You're Glassman's guy? - Yeah. - Nice car. Just you? - Just me. - Hell. You know, I'm thinkin' we need a complete team on this, I really do. - I think we are a team. Me, you, the guy in there. We're lucky nobody gets hurt. Excuse me, you're mall security? - Yes, sir. - All your guys good? - Yeah, all accounted for. - All right, well, stick around, huh? - You got it. - There it is. All right. What's the first play, coach? - Establish communication, try to figure out who's in charge. - Try? Partner, he's actually waiting for your call. Oh, yeah. They're proactive, this bunch. - Hey, listen, Serge. I was hopin' for a strong number two in you. If that's not gonna be possible, let me know now. - Relax, huh? I'm actually rootin' for ya. You had a hell of a teacher in Glassman. So, let's see if you learned anything. It's your show, Chief. - Sacramento Police Department. - You see we serious, right? - Yes, sir. I see you're very serious. - I'm in charge. I'm Number One. You listen to me, no one get hurt. - Okay. Number One. You know what to call me, what do I call you? - Call me Thailand. - All right, Thailand. Listen, we want what you want. Nobody gets hurt. So, why don't you just come out, me and you talk it over, man to man. Figure out what's goin' on. - Fuck you, police man! I come out, you shoot us. And you don't come near store. Store surrounded. - Surrounded by what? - Bomb. Everything go boom. Everybody die. - Thailand, we don't want any bombs detonating. - He don't know that word, right, "detonation"? Just say "no boom boom". - You have more important person to talk to? Huh? Maybe you wrong guy. - No, no, I'm the right guy. Thailand, tell you what, all right? Why don't you just let me come inside unarmed, we talk, we figure it out, you let me see the hostages are okay, we go from there. Thailand? - Hell. - All right, everybody, stand back. Possible 10-89. You heard me, stand back. Loi. - Advencula. Detective Rick Gomez, Hostage Negotiations. - Ah, Gomez. - "Mo blacka"? - Yeah, she mo' blacka than anything else. And she proud of it. - I'm sorry, did we work a detail together? - It was the Mayor's Social, last spring. - I was not myself that night. - You were shit faced. I saw you knee drop the Captain. Bam, no stranger to dishonorable intentions, that man. - No, he wasn't. - So, is that why you're back on beat patrol? - What would make you say that, Detective? - I'm just sayin'. Any lady who handles herself like that has my respect. How do you feel about being my point out here? - Sure. - All right. Set up a perimeter. Put barricades up. Once the civilians empty this lot out, no one comes in or out of this lot without my say so. - Roger that. - And keep any update needy Officers out of my ear. - Copy. - And don't knee drop a brother. - Gomez. Hey, Gomez. Come look at the floor plans, huh? - I'm gonna need audio-visual. Check the roof access. Check the sewers, as well, with Smud. - Somethin' wrong? - You pull into a parking lot. You have the choice to rob an electronics store or a bank. Why not choose the bank? - Hell. You want a kick ass surround sound system instead of a boombox. - All right, got the loading doors over there to your North. - I don't think this is robbery, anymore. - Why would you say that? - Who's our guy stationed in the front? The skinny kid. - Shawn? - Just locked the door. - Oh, great, wonderful. - If they was robbin' us, why would they lock themselves in? You gotta dial out. - They almost caught us once. - It don't matter. This is life or death. - What am I gonna tell the cops? I don't know shit. - Just call. - All right, that's the freight entrance right there, and off to the North is the cafe. - And these right here are AC ducts. We can thread a fish eye through there. - Detective. A call from the inside. - I told dispatch to go 'head and forward all the calls from the hostage takers right here. - They know. This one's not from them. It's from one of the hostages. - Patch 'em through. - Yes, sir. - This is Detective Gomez. - My name is Hugh. I'm the supervising manager at Leisure Guys. - Hugh, could you speak up a little louder, please? - Actually, I can't. We might give away our position. The gunmen have approximately 30 to 40 hostages. - So, you're not calling me as a hostage? - No. - Well, that's good news, Hugh. That's very good news. Can you give me an idea of what's happenin' over there? We heard some gunfire before. Was anybody hurt? - As far as I can tell, no. - What about this leader guy? He calls himself Thailand. - Look, man, I'm hidin' behind a clerk's desk. I'm not exactly on a first name basis with these guys. - Fair enough. How many of these guys would you say there are? - I only see four, but there's a blind spot. I can try to get a better angle. - No, no, no, no, you stay put. Stay safe. We'll be in touch, all right? - I'll clear my schedule, Detective. - That's it? - You didn't try to get any more intel outta that kid. - I didn't want to put that civilian at risk. - Partner, you got 40 people in there at risk. They're gonna live or die on the decisions that you make here today. The hostage takers as well. Christ. Listen, look, I know you cut your teeth on vice and narcotics, right? But this is not one of the CIs that you're runnin' here. What're you doin'? I didn't do anything, listen, don't fuckin' shoot me, man. I didn't do anything. Hey, no! - All right, check outside of rooms 17, nine, eight. You got that, brother? - Sir, there's a call comin' in. - Thailand? - Now you listen, okay? We not want to give up. We want trade. - All right, that sounds like a start. You have my attention. - If you give us what we want, we not hurt them. Shoot me, I shoot, too. - Understood. - We want a chopper, a big chopper take us, everybody here to Thailand. I want four bullet proof vest, head-to-foot like Robocop. - Oh, my God. - Thailand, that's a really big request, brother. I don't know that I can do that. - You want customer dead or alive? - You know my answer. - Hey, hey. - Hey, hey, hey, what's goin' on? Folks sound a little agitated. - What you think, huh? We sit around campfire, sing song? - No, no, but I am counting on you to keep your men calm. No one gets hurt, right? You're the big guy in charge. - And one more thing. Important. - Hey, psst. You do not promise that dipshit a plane. - I'm listening, Thailand. - We want Ginseng. One thousand year old. - I'm not sure I understood what you said. - Ginseng tea! Ask Chinese people, they know how to make. It's 2:54 p.m.. I give you to four o'clock. Four people, four vest, four o'clock. Hurry up! We wait longer, I shoot somebody. We want full armor. Head-to-foot like Robocop. - Like Robocop. I understand. - That's just freakin' beautiful. It's a movie, Gomez. And this whack job thinks that it's real. I'm surprised he didn't ask for four seats to the King's game, too. Christ. - I get in touch with my boys, these fools are dead. Never liked them Chinese boys. Fuckin' Panda Express gangsters. - You think they're in the life? - Could be an initiation. What do they do for initiation? - That doesn't matter. Matters is that we get outta here alive. I got you, okay? Lemme just figure this shit out. We're gonna be all right. Hey, we can take them out. They're young and stupid, we can catch 'em slippin'. - Young and stupid with guns. That makes them dangerous. - Don't, you'll get us all shot. - We're all gonna die if we don't do somethin' about it. Do you not get that? We'll just figure somethin' out. - The AC ducts, they snake over the bathrooms right here. Now, if it's wide enough, we might be able to get a team in there. - No. We keep negotiating until all other options are off the table. - Detective Gomez. I hear we got a real shit storm here. - Well, the shit storm is somewhat under control. - Control? Aren't we still in a hostage situation? - Temporarily, yes. - Detective, let's ward off any bad ju ju and focus on the reality of the situation. - Well, I'm not really a superstitious man, Sheriff. - Listen. I don't want you to think that me being here is about any lack of faith I have in you. Got a lotta eyes on this already. Let's make sure we get it right. - Wait, wait, where you goin'? Where you goin'? If I can make it to the storage without bein' seen, call the police and tell them I can unlock the back door. - Storage room is 15 feet across the store. Pure exposed, a fucking gauntlet. - I wasn't raised to stand down in no crisis. - Oh, well that's very honorable of you. But you pull that hero crap, you could get me killed. So, please, refrain from doin' that. Boss? Boss? - When I make it to the storage, I'll make the call. - Well, looks like you bounced back from that operation last week, Don. Good. - Worthless DA. Inconsistencies in procedure. It wasn't fuckin' talcum powder on the table. - We'll get 'em on the next one. - Hey, fellas. I have floor plans for you and your men inside. - No need. SWAT's goin' through the front door hard and fast. Right? - Well, Gomez is runnin' this show. - Glassman finally hung it up, huh? Not a day too soon, if you ask me. - Well, did anybody ask you? - Worked Mercy Hospital with Glassman two years ago. Patient took his doctor hostage. - Yes, I remember. - If your mentor had just let my guy take the shot, we'd still have one more living doc in Sacramento. - I also remember the time at the insurance company. Remember that? Glassman talked to the hostage taker for over 40 hours. 15 hostages got out, no one got hurt. And we never had to resort to a tactical situation at all. - I don't like chatter. It's a waste of time, in my opinion. - And I don't like trigger happy cops. They get people killed, in my opinion. - I take my orders from you. Call it, sir. - The mayor's watching. Let Gomez do his job, Sergeant. He has all my confidence to make the right call. - That's how it is? - That is how it is. So, please, stay in your lane, we'll let you know if we need you, gentlemen. - Where does it hurt? I'm a nurse. - Hey! Be silent. - This girl is in pain. This woman needs to use the bathroom. She's ill. Right now. C'mon. Okay, okay. Why are you doing this? - Keep move. - Young man, are you even 16? - I said keep move. - We keep move, pendejo, just keep the gun on the floor. - Honey, honey, please don't irritate him. Please, she needs privacy. - Oh, don't rush. You know I can wait until you're done. Actually, save me some toilet paper, tough guy. - Excuse me, are you aware of what's going on in your store? - Yes, ma'am, I am. - You should be out there helping people. - That's what I plan on doin', I just need a minute to figure it out. Hurry up. - You don't want any part of what's in there. Look, I know you have the gun, but it doesn't take a genius to know that you know nothing about women or their hygiene. Now, I'm gonna need a minute to go pee. - Just give us a moment, we're almost finished. Please. Wait outside. Please. - Well, get the fuck out. I actually have to use it. Get out! Well, Gomez is runnin' this show. Glassman finally hung it up, huh? Let's make sure we get it right. - Gomez. - Detective Gomez, here. Is this Hugh? - The other guy. - What other guy? - The one who actually cares about living. Hugh made it to the storage area. He's gonna unlock the back entrance. - Yes! - I did my duty, and I told you. Now, I'm gonna hang up to avoid my own execution. - Seems like we got a lucky break. - Hey, hey, listen. I know that seems like a no brainer, but that storage area, that couldn't be further from the hostages. - So? - So, they said they might already have explosives. - You really think they have explosives? C'mon, Gomez. They're not terrorists, they're clowns. - For the record, no, I don't think he's got explosives, and I don't think he's a mastermind terrorist tryin' to outplay us. But keep in mind, clowns get a lot of mother fuckers killed. By accident. I mean, there're just too many variables. Look at that distance. - This isn't enough reason. I'm sorry, Rick. We need more. - This kid, the kid I'm talking to? Thailand? I got a rapport with him. I don't think he wants to hurt anybody. I think he's a scared kid who's fuckin' up. - What about the others? Can't say the same for his crew? - No, I can't. But I think he's got 'em under control. If he walks, they walk, and the hostages go free. No one gets shot, no tear gas, no drama for your cameras. This is what I do. - Okay, Gomez, I'm in. We'll do your way. - So, you and I are gonna break away from the rest of the crew, we're gonna head on over to a building that has... There's a building with a ladder. We'd climb the ladder, we're goin' up-- - Really? The silent treatment? - Thought my role was to follow orders unquestioningly, sir. - Devlin, you know it's all about the politics. Gomez doesn't have my full support. We need him in case somethin' goes wrong. As long as he officially calls the shots, our asses are covered. You're a real man of the people. - Look, take a small team around back, and post up. Wait for my call. - Hey. So, the parking lot's clear. - Thank you, Officer. - You got a swig for me, too? You know, if I didn't know any better, I'd say you're hiding out here. - Well, then I guess it's a good thing for me you just don't know me any better. - And here I thought hostage negotiators had to have strong people skills. - Communication varies depending on the situation. But reading people, that's universal. - Yeah? Are you reading me now? - No. I had your ass read at the parking lot. - As what? - Someone who doesn't put up with a lot of bullshit. Someone who does the right thing. - You're not gonna let me forget about that party, are you? - But if I'm right about this situation out here, it could go sideways a lot faster than the bullshit goin' on the in bank. - And? Whaddya gonna do about it besides tell me? - I got a scared kid who wants me to call him Thailand. After you get the information and the license plates in the lot, bring it back to me. But just me. - My Lieutenant might have a problem with that choice of protocol. - Is that what you want on your epitaph? "She coulda saved some lives, but she followed protocol." You got it all the way to there, that's a long distance. - Go 'head. - Hey, what's goin' on? Sheriff. - Look at the goddamn reporters. Get 'em back, Kap. The department does not want 'em here come game time. - Can you define "game time"? Sheriff, I asked you a question. - Come with me. I'll show you. We've got surveillance set outside the rear of the building. Once my men are inside, we'll drop a camera through the roof. - Hey, I wouldn't risk that. - Devlin, you copy? Stand by. - What happened to me being in charge? - Oh, you are, Detective. I'll make sure you get all the credit when this ends well. But end well it must. - Hi, this is Tory, reporting live in front of Leisure Guys-- Excuse me, lady. - Yes? - I'm gonna need the van and that camera across the street. - You can't just shove us off the premises. It's illegal. - Young lady, I'll let you know the day you can start lecturing me on the law. The van and the camera, across the street! - Okay, freeze us out, and I'll get a helicopter to hover right over the parking lot all night. - You listen to me. I'm not gonna let you threaten the lives of the people in that store or my office-- - Kap. If I may? - Have at it. - Ma'am, I'm gonna need you to move back about 100 yards. - Art, radio the pilot. Send him in. - 100 yards still gives you a perfect view of the store. Plus, it keeps you and your team out of harm's way. - You know-- - One more word, and I just saw a potential suspect roaming the parking lot. Now, if I make that call, guidelines mandate a 50 yard perimeter for the scene. That puts you and your team over there behind the Jimboy's off of Stockton Boulevard. Is that really where you wanna be? With zero view? Calling the story like an AM station ball game? - 'Kay. Art, move the van. Let's go. - Good call. - You know, I believe in teachable moments, Gomez. There's a divergence in ideology between jobs that are appointed versus elected. I have no wiggle room to hand hold rookies when the stakes are this high. This turns into a cluster fuck, I don't just lose lives, I lose votes. - This goes South, you sign their death certificates. - Well, I'm afraid if it goes that way, you do. On paper, at least. Light is green, Devlin, move in. - We gotta draw one of 'em over here. - That little one? He's loco! - And the one with the shot gun is too far away. - He don't know how to shoot, though. - How the fuck do you know that? - Look at him, he's scared shitless, man, doesn't even know how to hold the fuckin' gun. - Hey, store guy. Can you get this one with the shot gun? - Nah, nah. - What? - No. - C'mon, man. - You can't get over there? - No. Far away, man. - What're we gonna do, he's not in. - Look, if I get to the crazy one, are you gonna be able to hold him down 'til I rush shot gun boy? - I'll definitely be able to hold him down if she helps. - I ain't doin' shit without Wilma. - Wilma's in the bathroom pissin'. - You down to help us? - Do what? If we don't do somethin', we're gonna die. - Okay. - Hey! What take so long? - She was sick, I couldn't rush her. Okay, okay! - Move, move. Move. - Whoa, whoa, yo! Yo, yo, yo, I work here! I'm the manager here. Yo, follow me. I'll take y'all inside. Ow! - Hey, man, not so tight. Some coward ass shit, homeboy. - Sit down, now! - Whaddya gonna do, huh? - Someone need to die by now. You make decision very easy for us. - You think you tough with that gun? Huh? You ain't shit without that gun. Sit down! - All right. All right. - Put your gun down. You started this mess. Be a man and manage it. - Look, man, it's not worth it right now. Let's be smart about this. - Unit One is almost at breach point. Roger, full breach on my command. - On my count. Three. Two. - Who there? I said, who there? Better live now, someone die. Sir. - Detective Gomez, here. - You lie! You send police? - No, Thailand, no police. - Someone behind store. Someone come in. We kill everyone! - Thailand, I'm sorry, man. We had a miscommunication on our part. That's all it is. Just a little misunderstanding, okay? - Tell your men leave warehouse or someone die. We know someone back there. We not stupid! - You better call off Devlin. - Can't do it, he's gone too far. We gotta accept whatever outcome-- - The Grand Jury decides, and I would agree. My testimony will support Detective Gomez. His efforts to repair and erroneous error on the part of SWAT Team's Commanding Officer. How's that sound to you, Officer Advencula? - I like the erroneous part, sir. - Yeah, me too. It'll make a nice line on him in the official report. - Old Kappy's back. - Yeah, well, you tried it your way, Todd. You failed. Rest of the way, we're gonna follow Gomez's playbook. Sir? - Stand down. You are compromised. - That's it, we're out. Pull back. C'mon, may as well save one hostage today. - Wait, you guys ain't goin' in? - Looks like you gotta be a hero another day. - Nah, I'm stayin' here. - You can walk out that door, or I can taze you and we can carry you out. - What're you doin', white boy? Open your mouth. - No. - Open your fuckin' mouth! Why you walk so slow, you deaf? You police? - No, I'm not with the police. I work in the store. - Don't look at me. - I work at the store, I'm not a cop. - Walk faster now. I say walk faster now! - I swear I don't know who that guy is. You send spy! We catch him. Now he has to die and it your fault. - He's not a spy, he's a guy that works there, okay? The guy was hiding out. You have people scared over there. You gotta dial it down a little bit, all right? Now, let's just go back to our original offer, all right? We give you some vests, and you gon' let some hostages go. Thailand? Thailand? - You Gomez? - Yeah. Oh, Hugh, hey, brother. You all right? - Yeah, I'd like to help now if you need. - We definitely need. Tell you what, why don't you get him set up so he can look at a couple of mugshots for us? - Copy. - I didn't plan on leavin' 'til all my people got out. - 'Preciate it. - Right this way, sir, thank you. - Thailand? Thought I lost you for a second, there. - Where the fuck my Ginseng and chopper? Not hard! - I can't just pull a chopper out of thin air, and I can't pull a rabbit out of my hat. - Who want rabbit? I want vest! Why vest so fuckin' hard? Hundred cops out there, no vest, huh? You lying. - No, vests we can do. We're gonna get you some bullet proof vests, you let some hostages go. - We want million dollar, we want vest, we want a chopper, we want Ginseng, now! - See, there you go. You're all over the map again, all right? Let's stay focused on the offer. 'Kay, we give you vests for hostages. - Let me speak to someone higher. - I am the person in charge. - Then person in charge, no deal! You cheapskate. - Okay. I give you your vests, you just let some hostages go. Okay? Show us you're a reasonable guy. Just be a good guy. - I am good guy. I show you honor by speaking truth. You dishonor me! You dishonor all people here by lying! - All right, we give you one vest, you let a hostage go. - You send naked. No clothes, only underwear. You send one bullet proof big, one bullet proof small, two medium. Send naked so no hiding anything. - Send naked. - Naked. - We have these entry points here, here, here, here. Yeah. - Hey. Thought we were gonna use one of the SWAT guys to make the drop? - Yeah, well, I drew the short straw. - Subtext, Sheriff picked your ass. - Subtext means, "You're goin', you fuckin' traitor." You bet. Oh, hell. - I promised this guy a real vest, man. - That is a real vest. It's what we could spare onsite. Can't expect one of my Officers to take his off, can I? - If you want mine? - Oh, I won't accept the liability. We got more bein' delivered. - From where? - Citrus Heights. - That's 30 minutes away. - So wait. - Get a mic in here. - Copy. We'll be able to transmit everything they're saying. - Scout out a position in case we get a scenario to take a shot. - Roger that. - Stop! - Hey, tell Kapinski to hold. - Sergeant! Hold your position! - Thailand, what's wrong? - Wrong vest. I want long kind for my leg and arm, too. - Can someone tell this asshole Robocop is science fuckin' fiction? - Thailand, I'm not sure I understand, man. That is a vest. - That vest do nothing. You can shoot my arm, you can shoot my leg. You can fuck me up. Let me explain better to you. I give you 'til 4:30 p.m.. That not the one we make deal over. I keep them here all night. Okay, look. I let this girl go get the vest, then I let the two kid go. Two kid, you understand? Do you want them or not? - Yes, yes, we'll take that deal. Tell Kapinski to proceed. - You get me vest, you come back, kid okay. You get away, I shoot kid. Okay? - Are you all right? - Please give me the vest. - Anybody inside hurt? No. - You listen to me. We're gonna get you out of there, don't you-- - No, no, no, no, please! They're gonna kill my kids. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay, okay. Hey! Come here. You listen to me. We're gonna get you outta there. All right? Be easy. Go. Easy. - Sit down. - Uh-uh. You got the vest. With their mother. - Up. Up. Up. - Nice work gettin' mom out. - Yeah, well, Thai relented. Kid couldn't stop blushin'. It's a rare occurrence you see such a finely sculpted specimen as moi. - You da man. - Yeah. Christ. Hey, kids. I got one for you, and one special one for you. - The one they call Long, he's the crazy one. He's dangerous. And you feel like they're all related? - Long and the leader are for sure. I don't know about the other two. The one by the door, he seems scared. More than anything else, they seem like... - Like what? - Innocent. Take away the guns, and kicking people, and stuff, you know? - Sort of like scared kids in over their heads? - Exactly. - Thank you. Let's have you checked out by the medic so you and the girls can go home. Do us a favor. Refrain from any press interviews until you hear from us. Just so we get everyone's story straight. - Of course, sir. - Thank you for talking to us. - She confirmed it. There's a psycho in their midst. Just a matter of time before he turns it into a bullet festival. - That's not what I heard at all. I guess both of you need the interpreters, you and Ho Chi Minh and sons inside, huh? - Did you not just hear the lady say they seem like scared kids? What if they're not tryin' to hurt anybody? What if they're not... - No. Looks like they've got a lot to learn the hard way, Detective. - Man, I'm hungry. - I'd kill for a hot dog and a beer myself, right now. - You think we're gonna get outta this one? - When I was overseas, everyone in my reg' asked me the same damn question. - Hey, you made it out alive, right? - I did. And I fought some boys much younger than these, so, don't sleep on these mother fuckers. Shit can get hot in here. - I got you. - Brother Hugh, what you got? - I'll be honest with you, Gomez. These guys look like the real deal. Those guys inside? Not so much. - Yeah, I figured as much. You got time to hang around a little bit? - Yeah, I'm here. - Good. - Hey. I think I have a positive ID on one of those cars. A Toyota Corolla. - Tell me about it. - Registered to a Bim Khac Nguyen. And get this, they have three sons. Loi, 19, Pham, 21, and a Long, 17. - Long. Bingo. Good work, come with me. Kappy. How do you feel about goin' on a little field trip? - I'm almost finished. - Why don't you take that with you? Check this out. This guy is the father of our boys inside. Get over to his house, see if you can get him back here. You, run their names through the system for priors. Listen, when you run their names, keep it on the down low. There's no reason to alert our friends from the Sheriff's department yet. - Again? Isn't the part where I say I thought we were all supposed to be workin' on this together? - If you wanted to be in a perfect world, you probably shoulda joined the fire department. - My ex was a firefighter. He was an asshole. Maybe I should try a cop. - You know, you're both masochists. I smell the love in the air. What you want? - I have to go to the bathroom again. - Not again. You pain in ass, you wait. - I have lady issues, okay? - Let her go. - Can I go, too? No, you hold it. - It's been hours. I have to go really bad. - Hurry up! - Calm down, tough guy. Least I'm not wearing a bra for a vest. - It is kinda small. - Okay. You wanna go first? I know you're not feeling well. - No, I have to stretch out a little bit. You go, I can wait. - You. Up. Now! - You gotta untie me. - Okay, we let you go. Go free. - So, what happens when you go back to Thailand? Are you gonna go to school, or get a job, or something? - Just get home. Real home. - You know you can ask for things. - I am. - No, I mean, you need cash. A pit stop. You're never gonna make it without fuel. - Where we get it? - I don't know. Hawaii, Alaska, or something. - Just let me go? - We shoot you in leg. - No, no. You let me go. - Turn around. - You're gonna need to take someone with you, too. I've seen you guys. You guys are a mess. You need help. I can help you. - What? You help us? - I would if you stop hurting people. I don't think you're a bad guy. I don't wanna see you guys get killed. - We shoot you in leg, you show the news the wound. Tell them we serious. - To the front! Go! - Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God! - Go, stop. Stop! - Thailand, what did you do? Shit. - Oh, my God. Oh, my God, God, no, please. - Excuse me. That's for-- - Sensitive eyes, yes. Doesn't get more sensitive than the senior ranking Officer, does it? "Immigrated from Vietnam with their parents. "Long Nguyen was expelled in March "along with his friend Cuong Tran "after they were caught trying to set fire "to Florin High School." - That's all we need for the press. - These are violent, dangerous men. Get Boyles in position for a shot. - Yes, sir. - Good work, Officer. I'll be sure to note your diligence in my report. - Hey, Thailand, I thought we agreed no shooting. What happened? - TV see we serious. Just in case you don't. We want what US Army got. You bring me full body armor like Robocop, and chopper with gas to make it to Alaska. Alaska and four million dollar. - Four million dollars? You said one million. What's goin' on? - Two million, but don't push. C'mon, just get us what we want. - Thailand, you gotta stay calm. You gotta keep your men calm, all right? No one gets hurt. Hang in there with me. - Get vest. You get me what I want, I give you what you want. I just wanna go back to my country. - You want the good news or the bad news? - That depends, are they mutually exclusive? - Sheriff found out Long got expelled from school. He tried to set the place on fire. - Shit. He's gonna frame the kid as an arsonist. - Yeah, he already sent Devlin and his team in. Look. - Oh, it's like that, huh? - It's like that what? - Sheriff thinks he's got us at check mate. I think we got one more move. You know that reporter lady you were talking to before. - Yeah? - You think you can get her to get her chopper up here? In the air with the light on right here. - For you? I'll try. - For the GameBoy you bought. You play? What game? - Super Mario. - Me, too. That's my favorite game. - Are you going to kill us? - Fuck this. I know when shit's gonna go down. - How? The scent in the air? - You fuckin' kiddin' me, homeboy? - What? I'm bein' serious. Stinks in here. - Old man, you good? - Fuck it. Got my back, right? - Hell yeah. - I have a van. It's in the parking lot. Me, my uncle Hector, and my cousin. We could take you to the van, and then take you to get the vest. The cops won't shoot you because you'll have us. - We don't trust you. You try and run. - I won't! I have my family here. - How many fit in the van? - 'Bout 20. - You can take 15 of us, and let the rest go. - Cops can't shoot you if you have hostages. They'll let us go. - One problem. - What's that? - You lie! You think we stupid? Maybe we kill you to make example. - Fuck you! You owe me, you killed my baby! You think you have it hard? I have it hard. He has it hard. She has it hard. If you're not a white man, you have it hard. But we don't go around taking people against their will. - Sorry. I sorry. - Okay. Sit down. Sit down. Sit down! - What you want? - Someone order a helicopter? - They lie! No chopper. Where? - Thailand, chopper's on its way. But my superiors, they're not gonna let it land unless I get to see the hostages. All of them. All right? Look, I gave you my vest. I got nothin'. See? I'm unarmed, you can frisk me. I'll be your next hostage for free. - You bring Ginseng? - You know I didn't bring no damn Ginseng. This is serious. What about the money? - See that, you see that right there? That's the chopper. The money's on the chopper. Okay? We gotta do this, we don't have a lot of time. You the man in charge. C'mon. C'mon. Just stay calm, stay calm. All right, everybody, try to stay calm. We're doin' our best to get you outta here safely. - You tell chopper to land on roof. - Can we talk for a minute? - Nothing to talk about. Simple. We leave country. No one want us here. - Listen, they know who you are, all of you. You and your brothers. Loi Nguyen, Long, Pham, Cuong. My dad's a Mexican immigrant. I get it, I'm here. We lived in a two bedroom flat in the 'hood. Seemed like everyone messed with us all the time. So, I get it. I get it. I understand why you can be angry. Okay? But this is not the way out. No one has to do this. - He lie! - I only lied to get in here and talk to you, 'cause I care. Because I am you. My circumstances were like yours. You get it? C'mon, now, they know who you are. What you gonna do, take a chopper to Vietnam? All the way to Vietnam? You never heard of extradition? Look, you see all those Officers out there? With weapons? I could be lookin' at you through the other end of a rifle scope like them, but I came in here, I put myself at risk to talk to you. 'Cause I am you. And they're at the end of their rope. When they start firin' those weapons, people are gonna get hurt. You, me, them, and it's a wrap for all of us. - You lied to us? Now I have to kill somebody. - No, no, no, Loi, you're lyin' to yourself and your brothers. You're not a killer. I see that in you. I know it, 'cause I see it in me. C'mon, put the gun down. Put it down. - He lie! Set up the explosive. - No, no, no, no, look, no, look, no, look. Everybody stay calm, relax. There's no explosives, right, Long? Right? - You want to die? - No, Long, I don't wanna die. - Okay. I kill someone now. - No, no, talk to him, Loi. Talk to him, Loi, talk to your brother, man. Talk some sense to your brother, Loi. You! - Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. Listen, listen, just take me. Let them go, they didn't do anything to you. - You scared now, police man? - Yeah, I'm scared. - You no get what we want, you lie. - What you do? - So that we mean business. - Prepare to breach, crisis entry. - No, no, not yet. - Outta my way. You not in charge anymore. - Hello, this is Sheriff Todd. - Hello? I in charge now. I fuck up your man. - Well, that was a bad move, son. You need to let us come in there and get him before you do something to get people killed. - No! You not deal with Thailand anymore! You make this easy way. If you don't get what we want, I'll send all people out dead, cop will be first. - You're not dealin' with a negotiator anymore. You just neutralized your best chance. - You get a shot, you take the shot. - Slow, just be easy, take it easy. Take it, no, no, no, no! Stop, no! - Long, Long! - You, up! Why you bring him here? Open door. - I've got a clear shot. - Tell your son to put down his weapon. - You will stop this insanity. - Mother fuck! Where my vest? Long, Long! Long! - Put it down. Put the weapon down. - Pham! - Pham. Do what he say. - Drop the weapon, son. - Put the gun down. - Drop the gun. No! Loi. Put it down, please. This isn't you, man, put the gun down. Put it down quick, put it down. Put it down. Drop it. Loi, no, no! No, no, no, c'mon. I got him! - No! - I got him. - Hey, this man is unarmed. Man is unarmed. Man is not armed. He's been neutralized. Hands behind your back. Hands behind your back. You're safe, you're safe. Ah, hell, partner. Let's get you to the medic. - Too many people got hurt, man. - Hell, you saved a lot of innocent lives tonight. Glassman would be proud. You two, you take care of this man. - How's your head? - I have a hard head. - Yeah, you do. Had me worried back there. Hey. Drinks on me? - I could use one. - 11 injured. - Six fatalities. - Seven. It was seven.
