- Your mom is here. - What? Your mom is here. - Shit! - Shit! I Can fly You can smile If you're happy to be here. Snow is white clean and bright Come and enjoy this with me. Night is ending when morning comes We are close to heaven Our dreams come with the wind While you stay here together Hello! When you sing, you invent something, you invent a romance, a memory, a lie. When you sing, you make history. I learned how to sing screaming, without modesty, without sin. I sing to scare away the demons, to get my friends together, to feel the world, to seduce life. Are you the guy? What guy? The guy who can scream that Leo Jaime sent here? We all came out to Montreux On the lake Geneva shore line To make the records with a mobile We didn't have much time Frank Zappa & The Mothers Were at the best place around But some stupid with a flare gun Burned the place to the ground Smoke in the water Fire in the sky Smoke in the water What was that? This guy can really scream! That's the only thing I can do, man. But rock'n'roll is about screaming and jumping. It's not a lake, it's a river flowing to the sea, it's movement. So move this, see if you like it. Now we're talking! What's your name, bro? You can call me Cazuza. Cazuza, this is De; the one who gave you the joint is Guto; that one over there is Mauricio, and I'm Frejat. Frejat. - Do you want to rock'n'roll? - I want to have fun! Cheers! Your court thanks you toast Our star deserves it To his faithful fan club He gives autographs on checkbooks Run faster Caju! Bah, bah, bah, bah. Big boss Your generosity ennobles you I'm nervous, turn off the radio, please. Excuse me, lady, but maybe he's already gone home. I'm sure he hasn't. You know, lady, I have four children, and sometimes they disappear, but... Well, I only have this one. Stop! As long as there is uselessness and pot, there is still hope! Oh, no, Cazuza! Don't be a kid Get down from there! - Which way? - Get down from there! Which way? This way or that way? From here to there, it's infinity, do you know why? 'Cos it's forever. - Forever. - Oh, my God... If it's forever, it's not for you. Let's go! Come on! Let's drink. Get in the car! - Let's drink! - Let's push! Nico! Go, go, and go! They're here! The most efficient guardian angels in all of Rio de Janeiro:. My king and my queen! - Cazuza! - My queen! Let's go, son! Look, thy court. A-team of bums, approved at the worst places in town: this is Vadao, floating address; property: the clothes he's wearing. - Let's go! - His crime: not having a place to live. Maneco has a place to live, but prefers to be drunk out on the streets; Tonico is 22 years old and flunked civics. - His crime: thinking too much. - Stop it! Nobody is supposed to think here, Mom. And, finally, this South Zone shameless bourgeois. - Let's go, Cazuza! - I can't, Mom! I'm not leaving by myself. My friends are coming with me. See what happens when you're away so much. - Not now, Lucinha. - It's easy for you, Joao. You leave early and come back late. I'm tired of disciplining Cazuza by myself. You need to talk to him. Soon! What should I do about you? Don't forget to put gasoline. I asked you what I should do about you. I'll do it on my own, Dad. On your own, you'd still be at the police station. Did it cost a lot? It's not a question of money. Actually, you do well to spend money with friends. I want to know where you're headed. Don't you want to get somewhere in life? I was at the beach, at the police station, and now I'm here; three different places. You know what I mean. I do: leather armchair, air conditioning, diploma, cuff links, cologne, bills to pay... And I pay them all, yours and mine. You said it wasn't about money. It's about what you do to make money. I have fun, dad. I love my friends, I don't hurt anyone. The problem isn't hurting someone else, but hurting yourself. That's the point, Big John. I need my friends to protect me. Vanderlei, come here! Come on, let's go! You got a light? Always! Be careful! Caju! Tonico! What's up? What's your name? - Malu! - Malu! - Do you want some? - Sure. Tonico, Malu; Malu, Tonico. Vanderlei! - What's your name? - Mine? Cazuza! - What about that tattoo? - Do you like it? It's beautiful. It matches you perfectly. Malu is a sonorous name. Malu! Don't take advantage of me like that! - Where is he going tomorrow? - Who? The sun. He's going to tomorrow, in Japan. Tacky, crazy people. Come on. It's three to zero. Hello, everybody! What's up, brother? Hi, De! You're late, Cazuza. - The traffic was bad. - What traffic? Everybody was early. We're professionals. Right, very professional! What's this? Underwear on the drums? And dirty, too. - Did you bring the lyrics? - Yes, right here. I'll trade them for a cigarette. Deal done! - Here. - Nice! What? That's it? The best perfume in the worst bottles. The same old story! I don't know what my body shelters On these warm summer nights And let a thousand lightning bolts strike bring a clear meaning to my reasoning I'm feeling so down, I'm feeling so down... One more time I'll sing to you I'll scream to you I'll tow you away From the bar That's not it. I wanted something weird. I had Janis Joplin on my mind. So tomorrow we'll rehearse the blues! The blues! Slow down! We're made of flesh and bones, for goodness sake, the flesh is weak. Slow down! We have a lot of flesh, that's the beauty of it. Slow down! Relax, bro. We're under the limit. - What limit, man? - Mine! Stop this shit! - What the hell! - Are you crazy, Frejat? - What the hell! - Where are you going? What the hell! Are you crazy? - Frejat, what's wrong? - He's pissed. Roberto Frejat, my love, come back to your bros. I'll be a good boy! I promise! I've friends everywhere in the beach, in the cinema, in the theatre, in the slum quarter, journalist friend, waitress, vagabonds... My business is not adding, but multiplying, I can 't make it by myself. I walk around in a group, disguised, masked, partying. I feel myself at home, in the middle of the street, daybreak, inside the crowd. I belong to the tribe of hugs. Hey Caju! I'm waiting you "there", ok? Malu! What's up? How are you? Luizinho, bring us four! Mothers have to give birth twice: once, when we're born, and then when we grow up. - The second one is harder. - Harder for whom? For all of us. Mothers are great when they're far away. I'm going over there. Luizinho, release the outgoing one... Already? Give it to her. You've got to know what you want and go for it. That's too much: knowing what I want, going for it, and being like everybody else. - No, I won't, man! - Let's go. I won't! - Good morning, my little bird! - Good morning, honey. Why didn't she stay for breakfast? She who? The girl who slept with you. There were no girls here. Are you spying on me? Yes, I am. Why aren't you like everyone else? Because everyone else is full of faults. - And you're not? - No, I'm not. I don't have any faults, I'm you're only child. I'm perfect! - Bye. - Are you leaving? - Eat your breakfast! - No, I'll eat out. "First comes a warm kiss, one tongue searching out the other, seeing if there's chemistry in the mouths, if there's chemistry in the kiss. Then it's the skin, if the texture is right, hair on hair." You know when you're walking alone In the daybreak with your hand in your pocket Out on the street And you're thinking about that girl You're wishing and hoping She wants you, too Then finally you meet the girl... - What a happiness! - What a happiness! I'm Aries, and we don't ask for permission, we just walk in, knock the door down. I've never been afraid of showing off. You can stay home, protected by four walls, but you're alive, and this life is to be seen. Did you like my mortal jump? This is my show. Showing yourself, you'll find yourself, even if you get lost along the way. You tell her - Everything's good... - Good! - Everything's fine... - Fine! But really, But really... I preferred you were Naked! Guys, I have news for you! I'm going to Bahia. Hold on a second! What are you talking about? Somebody found a house in Trancoso, everybody's going. Going? How? I don't know. By bus, by car, by boat, by plane, on foot, by train, whatever! No! Come back here! Do you think you're going to travel just like that? So what? Who's going? Everybody, you don't know. Yes, but who? Everybody, Dad, the whole gang! No. What do you mean "no"? You're not going. You can't just walk in here announcing things. You must ask for permission, and you're not going! I'm going whether you like it or not. If you go, don't come back! He only moved out, Lucinha. It was past time. Maybe you're right. But don't ask me to like it. We don't like everything. He'll learn to survive on his own. I'm afraid he'll get hurt. You have to find a way to keep him close to us. ...on the opening road, the bombs at Rio Centro. Inside, the Labor Day concert. Outside, a bomb exploded close to the power station. This is crazy! They just granted amnesty, will they clamp down again? That's probably why. Someone didn't like all that. Things are going to get worse. It can't get any worse. You think so? They can make us wear uniforms, put up a barbed wire fence around the beach, or tiles around the Lagoa, and all that crap! You guys are tripping. We are always tripping. I think I'd better go. I'll take you home. - Are you leaving, Pale Face? - So early? You're ruffling, Caju! Where are you taking me? Far away from all that paranoia. I've put aside all the torment Of a world bent on not forgiving Lovers without pretense Delirious ways of loving I want to smell love I want to exhale sweat For the day when you go away You're crazy! - No, I'm not! - Yes, you are! You burn money! If it's good for you... - What do you know about it? - Everything, Cazuza! The stuff you threw out wasn't just mine. It was very expensive. I'll pay for it! Fuck your ass! Things won't be easy at this record company. - I don't want to wake up early. - Okay. Get me different working hours. Do you want to sleep or to work? Both, but I want to sleep more than I want to work. - Good morning, Zeca. - Good morning. Look, this is your foreman. Zeca, this guy here has to obey you. - Put him to work! - Don't worry! - Bye. - Bye. Now that you're my slave, grab that bottle of whisky behind Nestor and we'll celebrate your emancipation from slavery. Now. Stop. Zeca. Coming to the same place he goes every day... This won't work out. Boy, the only perfection in life is happiness. Cheers! Imagine this. Right behind this wall is the beach, the Atlantic Ocean, so fucking blue. On a day like this, we have to fall in love. Let's go to the beach! Fucking pain in the ass! What's wrong, Mom? Why are you so sour? I'm being a great son to you, I'm even working. Give me a break! Would you please talk to me! I brought you what you asked for. - Lsn't that what matters? - What's your problem, fuck!? I'm fucking myself. I always do what you say. And since you told me to, I'm still fucking myself. Mom, Cazuza - give me a kiss. - Cazuza, stop being crazy! - Are you giving me a kiss? Cazuza! Stop being so crazy! Burroughs, Henry Miller, Kerouac, Rimbaud. Choose one and read it for us. "Together, we can see the beauty of the soul, hidden like diamonds in the clock of the world..." Give it to me. Look. You're going to tear up Allen Ginsberg? Fuck yourself! There are certain things good for reading, there are certain things good for hearing, and there are certain things good for smoking. You know, boy, you may not know what you want, but you do know what you don't want. So, don't waste your time! What are you talking about? Whatever you want to understand. Come here. Look. When I have a lot on my mind, I write down all my insanities here. Sometimes things come out too fast, so, with these simple tools here, we can... stop beauty. Everything is possible, Cazuza. Everything! I don't care if people slander me Slander me - Cazuza! My voice is hoarse I'm crazy I'm your love understand that You must find out what you're missing What you're missing Thinking you're a hotshot posing as a star You just need sex! You need sex! - Why did you stop? - You're off beat. Do it wrong with me! You're such a perfectionist! Let's go! Let's go! One more! It was good! It was great! - You drunken bastard! - Go on! Get out of here! You should learn how to sing first. If you don't like it, shut the window! I'm not talking to you, lady. I just want to sleep. Do you know what your problem is? You'd never drunk! Beard-face, you don't know what you're missing! Go to hell! Alcohol... Bread is reality, but alcohol is imagination! It's in the Bible! Infidel! Amen! - That's it, Caju. - Amen. For me, it's over! Come back! Come back! Cazuza! Come back! Come back! This is great music, Joao. Trash. But that's how these kids are, noisier and less sophisticated. For me it's all trash. But that's their greatest quality! They're not worried about polishing it up. Trust me! I think they'll screw up if they show this. But I think exactly on the contrary, it's an irreverent garage sound, it's great! No. What are you afraid of? That this is crap, and they'll call him "Daddy's boy." That's nonsense! Here, baby. Turn it on. What's up, Daddy? Is there anything wrong? Nothing, son. Just play your music. Give me a light. Light this joint. Guys, here's the review of our album! "The 'Barao Vermelho' album is finally out. But, unfortunately, it's disappointing for those who are used to the boys' explosive energy on stage. While before an audience, the group shows an infectious adrenaline, this doesn't happen on vinyl. Rock fans would be much happier if Barao Vermelho invited them all to an exciting garage rehearsal." That's yesterday's paper, it's over. It's stale news. Yesterday's paper, day before yesterday's news. That's right! I belong to a cool generation. I have no patience for the military, parades, or scared people. People were petrified, speechless, anesthetized. We couldn 't pretend there was nothing going on. To change things around, we had to scream, drug ourselves, go to the streets, face our weaknesses. We didn 't want to surrender, become outdated, bald. Zeca, you old faggot. Good thing you reserved a gym! Zeca, we could've done it in the van. Let's go! Zeca! Now, seriously. You should take the guys to the main floor to look more crowded. Give me a kiss! Let's go! Show me some excitement! This place is fuckin' empty! Come on, Mauricio! Come on, guys! Let's show them that rock'n'roll is for one and for a million! Barao Vermelho! Baby, I'm out of my mind Going from bar to bar With this idle talk Just to see you passing by, swinging Staring at me giving me hope Damaging my eyes Moving from table to table Smiling at everyone Pretending you're easy Playing hard with your heart, cutie Everyone has a weak spot And you're mine why not? Yes, you're mine why not? Cutie! That's what I needed! Get out, Zeca! Shit! Watch out! Here I am! Barbarella's arrived! Here, Zeca. Here is your glass. The telephone! Shit! Hello! Yes! Hi, Lucinha! How are you, honey? Cazuza? He can't talk right now, he's in the middle of the concert. The concert is wonderful! Are you leaving, Frejat? Don't go, Frejat! Come here, come, come! Hello, Lucete. Lucete! She's pissed off! I lost my shirt. I can tell. - T-shirts are all the same. - Thanks. My mom is going to kill me! There's only one-way to avoid that... I envy you. You're free, you're a star. Do you really think I'm a star? You shine a lot. You're beautiful. No, you are. All right. Tell him to deliver it. Okay. I'll call you back. Bye! Good morning! - Good morning! - Listen to this, Joao. I want to be lucky and find quiet love That tastes like bitten fruit In rhythm swaying in hammock We quench our thirst in our saliva - Nice that! - To be your bread, your food Is it Caetano's? No. Come on, tell me! Whose song is this? Don't you recognize your own sperm? Come on, Zeca! This is by your son! - You're crazy! - Last night, Caetano sang this song and it was just wonderful! Everybody thought it was his, but he said: "No! It's Cazuza's. The greatest poet of this generation." Did he really say that? John, Cazuza is already flying. And all-by-himself! "l was lost at sea many times, with my ears full of fresh-cut flowers, with my tongue full of love and anguish. Many times I was lost at sea. How I get lost inside the heart of some boys. Because roses search for a harsh landscape of bones, and man's hands can only imitate the roots on the ground. How I get lost inside the heart of some boys. And I was many times lost at sea. Oblivious to the water, I seek a death of light to consume me." Federico Garcia Lorca. So much in common Giving away our secrets... "l just need to tell you I love you, to win or lose you completely..." It's great! - Let's record it. - Come on. When we talk About our affairs our nonsense So much in common Giving away our secrets And I don't know when I should say it I get scared I'm so scared I just need to tell you I love you To win or lose you completely I need to tell you I love you So much My guitar, De! Mauricio. Frejat is playing the ladies' man today. I noticed that. I just noticed his mouth. Do you want some booze? I have some here. - That's it, man! - Lt was great, man! - Have some. - Right now. Marijuana, white powder, booze... Mom, what are you doing here? More white powder, bouncing powder... - Give me that! - Cazuza! - We're all naked here. - Give me a break! Frejat, how can your mom put up with all this? My mom is just like everybody else's. She can't know everything. Wait for me! There aren't any men here. This is Beto. Cazuza, I've been looking for you all night long. I'm always around, Serginho. Not when I need you. I need to be alone sometimes. But you're not alone. I just wanted you for myself. I don't belong to anyone. Good luck, Beto. What the hell, Serginho? Let him go! You spilled coke all over. Are you crazy, Serginho? I'm asking for your hand Take me anywhere Just a little bit of protection For an abandoned adult Your body with or without love Scrapings and leftovers are enough for me Love me like a brother Sincere lies are enough for me Enough for me Stale crumbs from your bread Scrapings and leftovers are enough for me Small potions of illusion Sincere lies are enough for me Enough for me The end. And the night is over. White foam washing my feet. Can't you see you belong next to me? Why did you choose me? In the middle of the crowd, you looked different. And look what happened to you. It doesn't matter. That's how love is. Stay calm, everybody! Everybody stay calm. Easy, everybody. Empty your pockets. Come on, empty your pockets. You can't prove anything here! - Shut up! - Don't push me! - Where's the other guy? - Who? - The other guy. - What other guy? Get out of my way! Police! Police! Stand up! - What's going on here? - Stand up! Frejat, what's going on? - Frisk him! - Be careful! He's clean! What do you mean: "He's clean"? I'm crazy too. I'm never clean, I can't be clean now. Crazy people belong in a mental institution. He found my wallet! I've been looking for it all over! Thank you! You're so funny! Watch it! Let's go! You're all going to the police station! - What? - All of you to the police station!! Come on! Frejat, I'll send you a lawyer and some pizza. Pizza, first, okay, bro? Pizza... Let's go! You're in shape, Big Boss! Are you hiding from the women? What are you talking about? You know I only have eyes for your mother. I know, but do they know? A man like you, looking like a movie star... They must go crazy! Tell me, Big Boss. Actually, they try. But you resist fiercely! Well, I try, son. You're happy, aren't you? Happiness comes and goes. It looks like the military will ease up. Yeah, right. They'll put another old man in power. What did you expect? A superhero? Hero? Heroes for me die crazy, they never get bald or become bureaucrats. Everything is easy for you, son. No, it's not. There's right, there's wrong, and there's all the rest. - A few things never change. - What things? Let's see how your generation will behave in power. Every day insomnia convinces me that the sky Turns everything into infinity And that loneliness is a pretension Of those who hide and play games Every day there is a late movie on TV Only lovers understand it Come on, let's go! We 're almost there, baby To start a happy new day That's the life I've always wanted The whole world waking up While we fall asleep Every day is a day in the name of love That's the life I've always wanted Looking for a spot here and there In your swaying hips Swimming upstream just to exercise Every single muscle you can feel Give me the chorus! To start a happy new day! Louder! To start a happy new day! The whole world waking up While we fall asleep To start a happy new day That's the life I've always wanted The whole world waking up While we fall asleep Thank you! A happy day for everybody tomorrow in a new Brazil with you great young people! Thank you! One, two, and three and... Another drink Of course I want some The night is never-ending Why are we like that? Stay with me now And never go away See if you can swallow me But don't chew me up like that I'm sorry. My mistake! We all make mistakes. Mistakes are fundamental. Come on, next one! We're having a bad day. Come on, Mauricio! Life has just begun for you And you've already... Come on, let's go! You don't even know which way to go This one. It's Cartola! Let's see what it sounds like. Come on. - Listen... - That's it for us. No, turn it on. Cazuza, let's concentrate. What's wrong, Frejat? Let's play this one. Fuck, man! Rehearsal is over. On each corner your life dies a little Listen, man! One thing at a time. Soon you will no longer be what you are Calm down! Why should it be one thing at a time? This is samba! Rock singers don't sing samba! Listen to what he's saying! There's no such thing as right or wrong music. - There's good music! - I agree! But Barao plays rock'n'roll. It's that simple! I love simple things! But sometimes it's not enough! Fuck your ass hole, Cazuza! Come with me! Listen to me my darling Although I know you've made up your mind On each corner your life dies a little Soon you will no longer be what you are Listen to me my love Pay attention the world is like a mill That will grind up your worst dreams And will turn your illusions into dust Listen to me my darling From each love you'll only inherit cynicism Suddenly you'll realize You're on the edge of the abyss Which you have dug with your own feet Recess is over. Come on! Let's go on! The audience is restless! They'll soon break down the theater. - Zeca... - What? Go get Cazuza. Cazuza! Come on, Cazuza! - Let's go, young man! - I'm coming! Keep one for me. - Let's go, guys! - Hold this for me. Come on, Cazuza! Come on out! Hold on a second! We have to go on stage now. I'm going, fuck... wait there! Come on, Cazuza! The audience is going nuts! I'm getting ready! I'm not joking! Open the door. Hold on, Frejat! I'm going to burst it open. Shit, Frejat! Look what you've done, you sun of a bitch! Shit, man! You've destroyed my face! Shit, man! - Sorry, little brother! - Fuck you, little brother! You hate me! What'd you do with the guy! You went crazy? Hello! I busted my head looking for you. Thank you! Let the fun begin! Go follow your star Your star game Secretly fantasizing Where you want to go Your future is uncertain I see money, I see pain In the dangerous paradise That the palm of your hand has shown Those who give their all never get tired Shake, Bete, my love Let me know when the time comes Don 't pay attention to those sad faces Pretending we don't exist Sitting down they look so funny Owners of their own room's A hundred thousand copies! A hundred thousand repetitions of the same thing! Listen! If ten people hear each one, you have a million! And ten is not a lot. Little boy, there are tons of people listening to you guys, do you understand? That's the point. I don't know if I'm saying what I think. I know I'm not saying what I want. Me! Me! Me! Me! This record is not only yours, we're a team! Cazuza, if you leave, you'll tear me apart. Zeca, look at me and tell me if I'm happy. I like things messed up, I want to mix everything up, do different things. This thing here... Don't bite the record that feeds you. But if I want to do things my way, I have to do them on my own. Caju... What's this story about going it alone? What are you getting at? Nowhere. I'm out. You're out. Now that we're on top! It was becoming painful, rock'n'roll can't be painful. What about our next record? I love you, bro! Our partnership will be forever. I'll keep this as a souvenir. Why should we lie pretend we've forgiven? Try and stay friends without any resentment The feeling is gone What a coincidence that's love! Our song never played again Why try to be so polite? Trying to distill ulterior motives Wasting away all my honey Slowly from flower to flower Among my enemies hummingbird Why would someone make up that he died of cancer? Nobody is ashamed of dying of cancer. An ashamed dead person? He was ashamed of what he did when he was alive. - His family was. - Nobody should be ashamed. Is there anybody here ashamed of something? Who is ashamed of something here? You! Are you ashamed? You don't look like it. What about you? Are you ashamed of anything? You're ugly. This little couple here. Are you ashamed of anything? What do we think about when we drink red wine? We think about dirty things. I bet you're having dirty thoughts. When you leave, you'll do something dirty. Are you leaving? Wait! It's early. - I'm sorry. - It's all right. Calm down. Go on! Buy her a chastity belt, and throw away the key, swallow the key. From now on, it's just the missionary position, no more dirty things. Leave him alone! Bring us some whisky. This disease is shitty! They don't want us to be happy! Tancredo de Almeida Neves passed away tonight at the Heart lnstitute at 10:23pm. Hello! No, Mom, it was just a fever, I'm fine now. Petr?polis right now? No, if I get better, I'll go up. Okay. I love you. Why should you lie If you still don't have The gift of knowing How to deceive Why? Why should you lie If there's no need To betray me My angel! My angel! You slept in the hammock and didn't even come in. You want your mommy! What's going on? Everything I've always wanted, I guess: headlines, acclamation. I think I made it! Isn't it just wonderful? Yes, it is. But, sometimes, the speed of things scares me. - What do I want next? - When? I don't know. I always want something. If I have nothing else to wish for... What's going to happen afterwards? You need to slow down and be more patient. I don't know if I can be any different. Love of my life From here to eternity Our destinies were traced in the maternity ward Cruel, unrestrained love I'll bring you a thousand stolen roses As an apology for my lies My mistakes Exaggerated I throw myself at your feet I really am exaggerated I just love to invent love I'll never breathe again If you don 't notice me I can even starve to death If you don 't love me And I'll abandon everything for you I'll beg, steal, kill Even the most trivial things For me it's either everything or never again Exaggerated I throw myself at your feet I am exaggerated I just love to invent love I throw that love at your feet With a thousand stolen rose 's Exaggerated I love to invent love Exaggerated Cazuza! Cazuza! Come here, fuck! Cazuza! Talk to me, fuck! Cazuza! Calm down! What the fuck did the doctor say? What did the doctor say? The doctor said I've been 'touched' by AlDS. What? He said I've been touched by AlDS. I can't lend my clothes to anyone, I can't kiss anyone, all my stuff should be kept apart. That's nonsense! What does the exam say? Let me see! I didn't read it! The doctor wouldn't lie. Cazuza, calm down! We'll look for another doctor. I'm going back to where everything began. No! Calm down! Cazuza, come here Cazuza! Don't leave me, my little bird. I won't, son. Don't let your coffee get cold. Time doesn't stop, and we still run around. I'm feeling weak. There's a world around us, and we don't even perceive it. I'm getting thinner and too small for my clothes. I feel I'm gathering all my stuff, concentrating. If I could, I would put it all in a bottle and drink it all at once. I wonder what will be left of me? I can only insist. Now that's enough! Thank you. Honey, eat something. No, Mom. That's enough. Hospital food is bad enough. American hospital food is even worse! Cazuza, you have to eat! Mom, there are so many things I can't do. And, hey, I won't quit smoking. Listen to that, Joao. Okay, one cigarette. One cigarette for what? One cigarette a day. Are you crazy? One cigarette per meal, that makes it three, plus two for the bath, that makes it five. Okay, five. Plus one per injection and change of dressing. Take it or leave it. Listen, Zeca. "Little by little becoming poets, insane, future singers and magicians of unsweetened wicked sentences." That's the very beginning. I'll write more, and the chorus are: "Ladies and gentlemen, I bring you good tidings. I bring you good tidings I saw the face of death, and death was alive." Alive! Don't give it to anyone. Write the song yourself. - Lyrics and melody? - Yes! It's ready! Oh, you scared me! What happened, Lucete? What did the doctor say? There's a new medicine: AZT. Is it the cure? It makes the virus weaker. It's a chance, Cazuza. Is it dangerous? They're testing it. I'll be their guinea pig. You're going home. We're all going home! Beach! Thank God! I'm leaving this shitty hospital, I mean, Boston... The boy who wanted to change the world Change the world Stop! I'm off beat. You were always half off. I know. I'm not breathing at the right time. I can't do something I know I can do. Cazuza, you're singing fuckin' great! I'll make a phone call, and I'll be back. - It's awful! - No, it isn't. - Yes, it is. - No, it isn't! - Did you call Angela Ro Ro? - Yes, I did. - Did you really? - Of course! Nilo! I've been looking for you. Where's my song? Come on, Nilo. Stop jacking me around! If you don't want to, say so! I don't have much time. All right. I'll be at the studio. I'm here. All right. He's putting one over on me. Take this. - Did you call everyone? - Everything's set. Let's go back to work. Go on back! That's it, go back there! That's it Very well. Does anybody have Angela Ro Ro's phone number? Let's start from the middle. Do you want to take a break? I don't have time for that. Come on, guys! My pleasure Is now life threatening My sex and drugs Have no rock'n'roll I'll pay the shrink's bill So I'll never find out who I am Find out who I am The boy who wanted to change the world Change the world Now watches everything perched on the middle of the wall On the wall All my heroes ' died from an overdose My enemies are now in power Ideology I want one for my life Ideology I want one for my life I prefer the misfits of the night to the boring people that don't know how to meet the dawn. This is the remedy. If you're not born crazy, you have to do something. - Right, guys? - Right! Enough! Let's go home. No way! It's still early. We haven't turned into a pumpkin yet. - No! You've drunk too much. - Stop it, Malu. But excess is fundamental. - Right, guys? - Right. What the hell, Malu! Drink it all! What are you doing, Malu? Wasting all that whisky! Good night. Where are you going? To the fuckin' mother!! Excuse me! Oh, no! Water? Is this a conspiracy? Your mom asked me to do that. She made me swear that you'd take your medicine on time, please! Luizinho, don't do everything my mom asks you. She'll take advantage of you. Luizinho, do you have any more AZT? We could turn it into powder and sniff some. Zeca, this drug is for me alone. Cheers! I'm writing this on a cold, dreary afternoon. I'm working to scare away my loneliness and my thoughts. Today I publicly announced my disease. I'm feeling more light and free... But I still have many fears: fear of flying, of the stage, of loving, of dying, of being happy... Fear of doing analysis and losing my inspiration. I make money singing about my misfortune. Buying a farm and having babies ' might be a way of staying on earth forever because records can scratch and break. Love, Cazuza. Remember that time we were driving around in lpanema? This guy cut us off, Cazuza opened the window and said: "You fucking faggot!" The guy came out with a gun and said: "Who's a faggot?" So everybody jumped out of the car: "l am, I am, I am!" This is wonderful. - Maneco was the first one. - Drink some. We were on our way to Rock in Rio. Are you afraid of drinking? I remember that. You kept talking about it. - Shake, Bete, my love... - Where's the little pot? - Malu! Finally! - Too late, Malu... The party is over! This stupid party is over! - Get out! - Calm down, Joao! Get out! - Out! - Easy, sir. Why are you standing there? Get out! Caju! My purse! All right! I scored. - Are you crazy? - Crazy? Me? Of course, I am! How could I be sane here? Yes, I'm crazy! Yes, I am. But who is crazier? What can I do to be as crazy as you are, taking your medicine and getting drunk? - It's none of your business. - Yes, it is. It certainly is! It is, too, my business! - They're my friends, Dad. - Friends? Those people are no good! Nobody is good enough in this life. My friends are no good, I'm no good. You're no good. I fire at the sun I'm strong I'm by chance My machine gun is filled with sorrow I'm just a guy Tired of running in the opposite direction Without a winner's podium or a girlfriend's kiss I'm just another guy But if you think I'm a loser You should know the dice are still rolling Because time never stops A few days, I do A few days, I don 't I go on living without a scratch Off the compassion of those who hate me Your pool is full of rats ' Your ideas do not correspond to the facts Time never stops I see the future repeating the past I see a museum of great new things Time never stops Never stops it never stops A few days, I do A few days, I don 't I go on living without a scratch Off the compassion of those who hate me Your pool is full of rats ' Your ideas do not correspond to the facts Time never stops I see the future repeating the past I see a museum of great new things And time never stops It never stops No, no, no, no, no, no it never stop! Thank you! Let's go. Hi, Juju. Help me out here. Come on, Bene. Juju! I was missing you. Be careful, Bene. All right, son. You're home! Let me help you here. Slowly. Thanks, Bene. We rush and rush, but there's nothing better than just sitting down. I always preferred being lazy. I was ashamed to. I was born shameless. I remember that cable car when you were a child. You cried because you wanted me to buy the ticket, then you cried because you didn't want to go. Then you cried because you wanted to go. Then you couldn't stop laughing and spitting on the people down below. Do you remember? I go back to the garden Certain that I should cry Because I know only too well you don't want To come back to me I complain to the rose's But that's nonsense roses can't talk They can only emanate the aroma Of the perfume they steal from you You should come here To see my sad eyes And maybe dream my dreams At last Mom. Whatever happens, I'll always be around. Psss... Life, crazy life Brief life Since I can't lead you I want you to lead me away Life, crazy life Enormous life No one will forgive us Our crime doesn't pay Come, come... Come! Life, crazy life Brief life Since I can't lead you I want you to lead me away Life, crazy life Brief life Since I can't lead you I want you to lead me away Away! Away! Away! Away! Love is the most ridiculous thing in life. We seek in it an impossible purity, a purity that is always setting, going away. Life came and led me along. Being lucky is abandoning yourself and accepting this vague idea of paradise that haunts us, a beautiful and brief idea, Iike butterflies that only live for 24 hours. Dying doesn 't hurt. CAZUZA DIED IN 1990, AT THE AGE OF 32. THE SAME YEAR, HIS PARENTS FOUNDED THE SOCIEDADE VIVA CAZUZA, THAT USES HIS ROYALTIES FOR THE TREATMENT OF HIV-POSITIVE PATIENTS. I pick you up at school And fill you up with all my love I take you to a party And test your sex as if I were your teacher I make weird promises short as a nice dream If I hide the truth from you Baby, it's to protect you from loneliness It's part of my show It's part of my show my love I mistake your thighs for other girls ' thighs I show you all my pain I make a baby in you I give you another life To show you who I am I wander under Arpoador's deserted moonlit rocks I say hello to the enemy I find shelter Inside my traitor's heart It's part of my show It's part of my show my love I make up excuses I start a fight I say I'm not here I live in a incoherent clip an old-fashioned Pierrot Half bossa nova half rock'n'roll It's part of my show It's part of my show my love My love... My love, My love... Dara, dara dara... THE END
