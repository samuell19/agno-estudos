They're formin' up over at Bismarck. - Buffalo Bill. - You know him? - Everybody knows Buffalo Bill! [laughs] Greatest showman who ever lived! I took Bess to see his show back in Chicago. Had Sittin' Bull with him. - Yeah, I'll bet that was really something. The Wild West? Hmm. - Yeah, it's changing. Railroads, telegraph going all the way out to California. Progress. Closing in on us. All the trouble we've been having lately, I've been thinkin' about pickin' up and moving out to the Pacific. Oregon. I hear there's land out there a white man ain't... [mysterious music] I never seen 'em just ride up like this. - [Man] Guess we better go see what they want. It's a baby. [gentle music] [people chattering] - You know they're never going to come here and the only way they're going to listen to you is if you got to them. - Miss Collins, your job is teaching Indian children, it's not setting Indian policy. - McLaughlin, you can't hold hearings and give away Sioux land without including Sitting Bull and Iron Dog. - They refused to come in. - Then if they don't come in, what is stopping you from going to them? We are talking about nine million acres of land, McLaughlin, nine million acres! [knocking on door frame] - Excuse me, Mr. McLaughlin? - What do you want? - Well there's a man with a baby to see you. - A man with a what? - A baby? [baby cries] - [McLaughlin] Well what am I supposed to do? - Well you're the Indian agent, aren't you? - I am, who are you? - Billy Montana. - May I? - Oh, please ma'am. There you go. Bunch of Indians rode in to the Boatwright place last night and gave us this baby, a little white baby boy. - I'm Mary Collins. - What kind of Indians were they? - A group of braves painted for war, I don't know who they were. - [Soldier] It was Iron Dog. - [Mary] Where did you get that? - [Soldier] The McDonald place. Iron Dog and his renegades burned down the house and murdered Tom McDonald and his wife. - How do you know this is Iron Dog's? - It's got ghost dance markings, same as his shirts. - You can't be sure it's his. - Lady, I know Indians. I got this from the Sioux. That belonged to Iron Dog and his ghost dance warriors. - Ghost dance, what's that? - Oh, it's a new kind of religious ceremony. It's got Sitting Bull and his followers all riled up and now they won't come in to the reservation. - Because we never kept our word. They don't trust us. Some Sioux believe that the ghost dance is the last chance they have to regain their land, bring back the buffalo, and live in peace. Iron Dog is Sitting Bull's medicine man. - He's a fanatic. He's got his warriors convinced if they wear these ghost shirts, they can't be killed. He's a dangerous man, and now he's gonna get what he's wanted all along, and that's war. - Well good luck to him. I ain't never seen a shirt I can't put a bullet through. - I wonder who wants this war the most. - Sergeant Grinder, I want the Sioux police and every trooper on the fort in the saddle and riding. - Yes sir. - If they were this Iron Dog's warriors, why didn't they attack Mr. Boatwright and me? - Hell, I don't know, they're unpredictable. - Where'd they get this baby? - Jane McDonald gave birth to a baby about five months ago. And I have a feeling that this is her son. I'll find a wonderful home for him. Thank you, Mr. Montana. - Thank you ma'am. Well, I reckon I should be heading on to Bismarck. You take care of this little feller now. - Oh, I will. - Goodbye all. [baby cries] Here you go, partner. - Thank you sir. - We got Indian trouble out there, boy, I'd watch my hair if I were you. - Well, I'll try to do a better job of it than you have. Howdy son. Listen, you take good care of this horse for me? - Yes sir. - All right then. I'll be staying yonder at that hotel. - Thank you sir. - You bet. [gentle msuic] [woman screaming] - Somebody help me! [woman shouting indistinctly] [suspenseful music] Somebody help! Help! Somebody help me please! Help! Help, help me! Oh please! Somebody help me! Please! Oh. Well looky here, Lonnie. Just like you said. A good Samaritan. A nice tall handsome one too. Kinda hoping you'd be a little older. And a lot richer. - Another move and you're a dead Samaritan. - Ooh. Lovely watch. You know, it's a pity you and me didn't meet under different circumstances. - Go on. [dramatic music] - Hi Brady. - Billy, Billy. Will you ever change? - Aww, come on, Brady. She was in trouble, you know. - She sure was. - Ooh. - Were you saving her from him or was he saving her from you? - She stole my granddaddy's watch. And my wallet too. What brings you here to Bismarck? - [Brady] Remember Missouri Jack Taylor? - [Billy] Yeah, blind in one eye, deuces always wild? - [Brady] Well this time I had all the deuces. [Billy laughs] Took his money and his horses. And I heard the cavalry was looking for mounts, so I came here to sell 'em. - [Billy] Yeah, well I just got here from Fort Yates. The way things look over there, the army's gonna need all the horses they can get. You remember telling me about a Sioux medicine man, friend of yours? - [Brady] Iron Dog. Last I heard he joined up with Sitting Bull and he's in Canada. - Well, he's back. There was a massacre near Fort Yates, Iron Dog's been accused of murdering a homesteader and his wife. I'm telling ya, Brady, it doesn't look good for him. - That doesn't sound like the Iron Dog I know. [gun firing] - Yeehaw! Woohoo! Woohoo! Woo! Woo! - Woohoo! Ha, you see that? [people cheering] [dramatic music] - Oh! - Woohoo! That's him. Buffalo Bill. - Ladies and gentlemen and small children of Bismarck, lend me your ears. I have the honor to announce the formation of Buffalo Bill's traveling wild West show! [people cheering and applauding] I have immediate openings for cavalry and Indians, wild buffalo and bucking broncos! Trick fighters and sharp shooters! If you can ride, rope, shoot, or throw a knife, I will personally meet, greet, and audition you at the Grand Livery Corral each day this week, starting tomorrow from sunrise till sunset. Tell your friends and neighbors, come one, come all! And I thank you for your attention. [people cheering and applauding] Gentlemen, my horses meant you no harm. Allow me to introduce myself. Colonel William F. Cody. - I know, sir. - You know sir, you look familiar, are you perchance a man of cards? - Brady Hawkes is my name. - Hawkes! Hawkes. Nope, never heard of you. Come on boys, I'll buy you a drink. - [Billy] It certainly has been a great pleasure to meet you, Colonel Cody. - Sir. - [Billy] My name is Billy Montana, and I was just on my way to see you. - What can I do for you? - Well, I was hoping to join up with you. I've always wanted to see Paris, France. - Ah, indeed. Paris is a grand city. - Yeah. - What skills can you offer me, Billy? - Well, I'm pretty fast with a gun, you know. - He's accurate too. - Fast draw, huh? - Yup. - Nope, I already have plenty of fast draw artists. You know, you would make a right handsome Indian though. Can you dance? [horse neighs] - Can he dance? Show him, Billy. [folksy music] - I have an appointment with General Miles for a friendly game of cards, would you gentlemen care to join us? - [Brady] Well, I've been invited, but thanks just the same. - Oh no no. One Indian or 10,000 Indians, they won't touch a hair on my head. And you know why? Because I sell their women what they want, pots and pans. - They want their child to grow up on the land, our land, our fields of corn and wheat. - Uh-huh. - And cattle. - Yeah. - Cattle grazing as far as the eye can see. - Then let me just say one word to you. Plows. It's plows that'll be the future of this country, plows cuttin' through just as straight as a Sioux's arrow. - The latest report on the massacre is that two of the Indian renegades have been captured and taken to Fort Yates. - That's $50 to you, General. - If there is nothing else, Senator, I shall feed the dog. - Be packed and ready, Peebo, first thing in the morning. - Yes sir. Gentlemen. - General, I may be able to help you with this Indian problem. Before you end up with a full-scale war on your hands. - Iron Dog may be a friend of yours, Hawkes, but this is a military matter. - All I'm really asking for is a letter of authorization that will allow me to ride through Sioux country on my own. - The army hardly needs a civilian to do their work for them. [chuckles] - You hear that, Bill? - When I was civilian scout for the army, Senator, I saved a lot of scalps and a lot of heads. They were all military. - I'd just like to talk to Iron Dog. Maybe I can convince him to come in and tell you his side of the story. - Hawkes, you knew this man a long time ago. Times change. And your renegade friend won't change with them. Gentlemen, I have a full house. Threes over jacks. [chuckles] - Eights. Over fours. Guess my house was fuller than yours. - Iron Dog is just a medicine man, Sitting Bull is the chief, and he's old. Why risk a war if all the other chiefs are leaning towards doing business? - These chiefs could just as easily follow Iron Dog into war. I'm certain it will be the government's policy that when this savage Iron Dog is brought to justice, he can be made an example of. Then the chiefs will be sure to follow into line. - Hawkes. Do you really believe that Iron Dog will remember you that well? Well enough to give himself up even? - I'm willing to bet on it. - I'm not. - General Miles, you call yourself a gambling man? One hand, me and you. All of this cash against your letter of authorization. What do you say? [gentle music] - You're on, Hawkes, I never pass up a free hand. - General Miles, you're gambling with government policy, I must protest this breech of administrative protocol. - Your protest is duly noted, Senator. My deal, five cards, two under, three up, no draw. You sure you wanna do this? - I came to play poker. - I guess you're not unbeatable after all, Hawkes. [laughing] - I tell you what, General. I'll play you double the pot against Brady's letter of authorization. That's a lot of money there for a little teeny piece of paper. - How do you plan on doing this? - Brady, she took my wallet. But carry my spending money in my hat. [laughs] - All right, you sit right down here, son. I may retire after this hand. - Deal 'em up, General, I'm your man. - I'm your man? - Yeah. - We'll play the same game, we'll have the same dealer, we'll have the same winner. - Three ladies. Montana? - I only have two small pair. All fours. - Most sacred number of the Sioux. Four directions of the wind. Four corners of the Earth. - Fair enough, Hawkes. You get your letter of authorization. [Billy laughs] [men chattering] [men laughing] - Mister, I am sorry, I didn't mean to spill this drink. - [Man] Down the hall to the left. - You know, my best friend got killed for spilling a drink on a man once. - Killed? Yes sir, I am drunk, and I do apologize. - Of course, I hated to kill him. - You see, I just bought some cattle today and it's sort of a celebration. - Well, any sod buster can raise a few cows. - My wife's gonna have a little baby. - And any whore can have a baby. [slow suspenseful music] - What? Who you talkin' about? - Your wife. [people gasping] - I want you to take that back right now, Mister. - No, Frank, no! - Stay outta this, Lisa! I want you to take that back now. [gun fires] [people creaming] - No! [somber music] [Lisa crying] No, you killed him. You killed him! You murdered my husband! - Maybe you'd like to try that with someone more your own size, Mister. Or do you just fight drunks and women? - No, sometimes I kill a dog or two. - Sir, you've done enough damage for today. - You may wanna let this one go. This boy's a lot faster than you think he is. - Well he better be. 'Cause some day, he's gonna have to prove it. - I'm real easy to find. [horse neighs] - I'm sorry about the accommodations, Senator, but this is after all the frontier. - [Brady] Billy, I know you won the letter that gives me the right to go, but don't feel like you have to come along if you don't want to. - One of us has always needed the other to watch his back. Why change a good thing now? - Well, that means you won't get to sign up with Buffalo Bill, and you're gonna miss that trip to Europe. - Aww heck, I ain't seen all of this country yet. - Well I'll be. That's Reva. - Who? - Reva Dickey. That may be the best friend a riverboat captain ever had. Let me introduce you. Morning, Mrs. Dickey. - Brady? Can this be my lucky day, is that Brady Hawkes? - Sure is. What are you up to this time, Reva? - I'm in the soap and scrubbin' business. [chuckles] - Somehow that doesn't surprise me. - Denise, I want you to meet one of my oldest friends. - It's a pleasure, Mr. Hawkes, I've heard a lot about you. - I hope some of it was good. This is Billy Montana. - Ma'am. - Brings you to this part of the country, Brady? - We're on our way to Fort Yates, same as you. - Doubt if it's the same as me. [laughing] - Well, it's probably not the same as you. - See you later, Reva, ma'am. - [Reva] You boys come back now. [Billy laughs] [gentle music] - If Iron Dog is in cahoots with Sitting Bull, they could destroy the progress we've made toward negotiating a fair and honorable land bill. - Iron Dog represents but a small band of radicals, Senator. He can be dealt with. - And Sitting Bull? - The younger Christian chiefs feel that he represents the old ways, old ways that don't work anymore. We have any trouble with Sitting Bull, I'm sure our Indian agent Mr. McLaughlin would be most pleased to take care of it. - You seem quite certain of that. - Most of my adult life, Senator, has had to do with war. Seldom have I known one man's hatred for another to run as deep as James McLaughlin's for Sitting Bull. - There wasn't a finer boat on the river. - Ah, Brady, it was dark as the night. Folks said that the end of an era was comin', that the Della Jewel had overstayed her welcome. - We had some great games on that boat. - Yep, I'm gonna miss it. - See something you like? - No, no. Just riding along, you know. Mighty warm day, isn't it? - Yeah. You'll get to see all of Mrs. Dickey's girls you want to see when we get to Fort Yates. - Mrs. Dickey's girls? Speaking of that Mrs. Dickey, is she really-- - Blind? Not so's you'd notice. [gentle music] ♪ Wish I was in Carrickfergus ♪ Only for night time in Ballygrand ♪ ♪ I would swim over the deepest ocean ♪ ♪ Only for night time in Ballygrand ♪ [wolf howling] - Sit. Down, down. Down, nice. Stay, stay, stay. Good dog. Fine obedience. - Senator Colton will be most demanding when it comes to his laundry. I've made some notes for you. Starch is a necessity. He likes his things stiff. Creases are also very important. In all of Washington, no one has more or finer creases than the senator. Finally the hangers. He prefers each item hung separately. The pants hanging from the waist, not the leg. The senator is most unhappy when he is not well hung. [grunting] - [Billy] Whoa, whoa, allow me to do that, ma'am. - Oh, thank you very much. - [Billy] No, it's my pleasure. - That's very kind of you. - Whew. [chuckles] You! Wait, hold it now. - Let go of me! Ow! - You get back here. - Ow! - Just where do you think you were gonna run off to out here, huh? - Sir, I don't believe we've met! - Oh yes we have, and you damn well know it! [gasps] Now you have something that belongs to me. - I don't know what on Earth you're talking about! - [Billy] Oh? - I've never seen you before in my entire life! Oh, all right. But it was not my fault. It was that man, he forced me to do it, he said he'd kill me if I didn't do it. - All right. - I had no choice. - All right. - I've never done anything like that in my entire life. Oh, but please don't tell Mrs. Dickey. It would hurt her so much if she knew. Promise me you won't tell, and if there's ever anything I could do for you. - Anything? - Uh-huh. - There is one thing. - Really. And just what one thing did you have in mind? [both laughing] - Give me back my watch, and my wallet. Please. [laughs] - Oh, all right. - Peebo. Take a letter. My dear Mrs. Colton, period. - Comma. Personal letter. - Comma. We are in the most uncomfortable of conditions, period. But, comma, primitive as this country is, comma, I am faring quite well, period, new paragraph. [wolf howling] - Do you suppose we'll meet up with any Indians? - I don't know. They couldn't be any worse than those church ladies back in St. Jo. [owl hooting] [people chattering] - Hands up! [women screaming] Don't you move a muscle. [guns fire] [laughing] [guns fire] Just blanks. It's me, Buffalo Bill. [laughing] I always did wanna play an outlaw. [laughing] - You nearly scared these young ladies half to death. - My apologies, ladies, I couldn't help it. [laughing] - Bill, what in blazes are you doing here? I know you're a practical joker, but even you wouldn't ride all day to sneak up on a wagon train. - These boys are on their way to see Iron Dog, and where there's Iron Dog, there's Sitting Bull, so I decided I'd postpone my auditions and go pay a visit to my old friend. - I believe Sitting Bull was quite an attraction when he toured with your show. - If he signs up with me, I'll sell out every show between Bismarck and Berlin! [laughing] Now, which of you beautiful young ladies could provide me with some sustenance? - What happened to the music? You know an Irish jig? Come on over here. [Irish jig music] [rhythmic clapping] [women cheering] - Get in here, Irish, get in here. Come on, girls, get over here. - The London press was very kind to me. Called me the greatest showman on Earth. Gallant soldier and Indian fighter, last of a breed, exploring the wild West. On the other side, where it says "vast uncharted Northwest territory." - Yeah, it's gotten so you can't believe half of what they print in the newspapers. - We're all the way from St. Jo. Where are you from, Bill? - Wherever this horse and a game of cards takes me. - Oh, Mrs. Dickey says no man alive works a room or table equal to Brady Hawkes, is that true? - You can bet on it. You know, I was once acquainted with the Wonderland Laundry Service, outside of Abeline? Cleaned up many a dusty cowboy. [chuckles] - Well, you drop by our laundry in Fort Yates, I'll clean you up real good. [women giggling] - Yeehaw. Listen to her. [laughs] - The railroad will cut through those mountains. Save 40 miles of travel by wagon. A straight line from Bismarck to Fort Yates. Fort Yates will remain and prosper as the major cattle delivery point for feeding the Indians, not to mention connecting with Chicago to bring in hundreds upon thousands of farmers and merchants. Ah, such General is the final bountiful harvest of manifest destiny in this great century. - Well that's all very interesting, Senator, but I think you're forgetting one important issue. - Oh, what's that? - The 6000 Indians that own that land. I don't think they're gonna share your enthusiasm for manifest destiny. - Oh, but they will, General. They will when they understand we're trying to help. Bring civilization to them, progress they so desperately need. [slow suspenseful music] ♪ Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily ♪ ♪ Life is but a dream [dramatic music] [yelping] - Get in back.

[child crying] - [Billy And Brady] Whoa, whoa. - Whoa! - [Brady] Whoa. - What happened, ma'am? - I was just taking my class back to the fort, and some men, Indians, came running down on us, and when they saw your party of wagons, they just took off. But by then my team was spooked and running. - Why don't you follow us back to the fort? - Thank you, I'd like that very much. Aren't you the man with the baby? - Yes ma'am, Billy Montana. - Yeah. Well I found him a fine home. He was adopted by a young officer and his wife and transferred back east. - Well, that's real good, ma'am. Mary Collins, meet Brady Hawkes. - How do you do. - How do you do, Mr. Hawkes. - [Brady] Brady, please. Why don't you follow us the wagons are just over the hill. - Oh Billy, that was splendid! Boy, the way you stopped that wagon put me in mind of doing the same thing in my act. You got a job. We need some spark, though, some fire. Fire, that's it, we'll set the wagon on fire! - Well, it's not exactly what I had in mind. - It's brilliant, son, and it's the opportunity of a lifetime. You'll be seeing the world with Sitting Bull and Buffalo Bill! Nightly the crowned heads of the world, notable personages will witness your spectacular feats of daring do in the greatest show that's ever been created on Earth by man! - [Billy] Whatever you say, Bill. - What do you say? 80 bucks a week, 11 shows a day! The most incredible experience you'll ever have in your life! Take charge of your life, Billy! Come with me, you'll love it! [gentle music] [people chattering] - There's been a hanging, Mrs. Dickey. Two savages hung and dead. - [Mary] Trooper, get these children to their parents immediately. - [Soldier] Yes ma'am, right away. [people chattering] - General Miles. Welcome back home, sir. - Who gave the authority to do this? Who? - Oh, those are a couple of renegade Indians, sir, Sergeant Grinder-- - Answer my question. - Well, they were found riding US cavalry horses, sir, so I used my authority and had them hanged. - Then you've done one hell of a job of exceeding your authority. - You did all of this on Sergeant Grinder's say so? - Well the point is, I wanted to send a message to Sitting Bull and Iron Dog, and I sent it. - [Mary] Why don't you tell the truth? You're only sorry because Sitting Bull isn't hanging up there. - Mr. McLaughlin, it may be too late now, but I've given Mr. Hawkes here permission to go and see Iron Dog. - Senator Henry Colton. Mr. McLaughlin? - Senator Colton, welcome to the fort, sir. - Seems Mr. Hawkes claims he knows Iron Dog. Thinks he can bring him back in. - Well, I agree with the general, I think it's too late. - That may be, but I'd sure like to try. - We are trying to stop a war, not to start one. - Sir, begging your pardon, sir, the feeling around here is that it's already started. - Well that doesn't happen to be in my theater. Mr. Hawkes has my permission to go see Iron Dog and he is going. - Thank you, General. - Lieutenant. - Sir. - Cut them down. - Yes sir, Sergeant Grinder. - Sir. - Take your men, cut them down, get the Sioux police to arrange for the disposal of the bodies. - [Grinder] Yes sir. - Men. [child laughing] - Iron Dog was a student of mine. That was 20 years ago. The first year I came out here. He had this fierce to learn. He wanted to learn about everything. - He would've been what, 12, 13? - Something like that. He was so special. Everything I taught him about our ways, he insisted that I learn about his ways. - All right, cut 'em down. Hey, baby finder. What about you? You gonna chase after Iron Dog too? - Yeah, as a matter of fact I am. You know when Brady Hawkes and I set our minds to do something, we usually get her done. - You do, huh? Well you were warned. - Yeah, I remember. - Hey! Don't cut that, that's a good rope, untie 'em. [mysterious music] - Easy boy. No need to be afraid. - The way the boy told me the story at school was that he had stolen 200 head of the finest horses in the country. - What else did he tell ya? - Just before he got back to his tribe, he was captured by a posse of 100 men. - 200 head of horses and 100-man posse? - Mm-hmm. - [Brady] I don't remember any of that. What I do remember is a mayor and a couple old pack mules he'd taken from some miners. He was so proud of those horses. I convinced the old timer that the Sioux don't hang young boys for stealing horses. They honor them. - You convinced him? - Well granted, it was at gunpoint, but I mean, they soon became very sympathetic to Indian tradition. [laughs] - [Mary] So that's how you and Iron Dog became friends. - [Brady] I saved his life, I can't say we became friends, he was a young boy and I was a grown man. - And now you're the enemy because you're a white man. Like so many others who promised to bring peace and never did. - Billy. I was thinking maybe you and me could plan some time together. - Yeah. Why not? Say, why don't we sit over here and I'll buy you a drink? - All right. [Billy laughs] - Hey, cowboy. I hear you and your friend are gonna solve all the problems that the whole damn army hasn't been able to take care of. - What's your point, soldier? - Well, the way I look at it, this here what's his name, Iron Dog? He's just one more murdering renegade. - I supposed it doesn't matter to you whether he's innocent or not. - No ma'am, it sure don't. We're gonna catch him, and we're gonna hang him. One more thing, cowboy. Or gambler, whatever the hell you call yourself. If you're with them, we're gonna string you right up alongside of him. And then this pretty thing is gonna have to keep me after school. Ain't that right, darlin'? [dramatic music] [glass shatters] - Would you wanna join me over here for a minute? Excuse us, ma'am. [grunts] [woman shouts] - Get your hands off of me! [shouting indistinctly] No! Oh, Brady! Oh no! Oh, Billy! - Misdeal. Lock 'em up. - [Mary] Get your hands off of me. - My goodness, boys. You got two counts here of assaulting military personnel. Three counts of resisting arrest, two counts of disorderly conduct, destruction of federal property. [chuckles] Make yourselves right at home here, boys, in your new quarters. You gonna be in there for a long time. The provost does not take kindly to civilians picking on the cavalry's finest. Rest you well. - He's talkin' like we don't have any rights at all! - We don't. - We didn't start that fight. [laughs] - Yes we did. - All right, but we didn't get to finish it. - That's because someone wanted us to start that fight. And not finish it. - Why? Who? - I don't know. I'd like to get outta here so I can find out. - That's easy enough. [laughs] All we gotta do is escape. [laughs] [laughs] - Three! [screams] - Bad girl, bad girl. Whoa whoa. All right, now here's the plan. First I'm gonna ride out, find Sitting Bull, convince him to go to Europe with me. I think I might just take you along too. - Oh! [laughing] - And then I'm gonna come back-- - Oh, but you can't. - Hmm? - No, I mean go to Sitting Bull. - Oh, Chief's an old friend of mine, sweetheart. - No, one of my friends told me the army's just waiting for Iron Dog to show up at Sitting Bull's camp. - Huh? What else did this friend tell ya? - That until they're arrested and thrown in the stockade nobody, not even Buffalo Bill, is safe outside this fort. - We'll see about that. - Hell. [laughs] [sighs] - I'd just love to see Paris. [claps hands] - Brady, I got it, I have got it! Believe me, this one will work. You start over here by the door, right? You're just doing something to trick the guard. Meanwhile, I could be hanging by a rope between the ceiling and the rafters. Now we string another rope from that corner to that corner. You start a-hollerin' and raisin' a ruckus, you get the guard to come in here, I swing down from that rope, I get ahold of that-- - Billy, Billy, Billy. We don't have a rope. - Good point. - One little thing, you gotta admit that'd work. - Yeah, it'd work. - Oh, it would. I'm tellin' ya, if we just had a rope, we'd be outta here in no time. [crashing] - Well come on, boys, what you waitin' for? [Billy laughs] - [Billy] You see, Brady? I told ya, all we needed was a rope. - [Buffalo Bill] We got country to see and things to do! - [Soldier] Go, go, stop them! [gun firing] - [Billy] Hyah, hyah! [dramatic music] [yelping] [suspenseful music] [horse neighing] - Hyah, hyah, hyah! - [Billy] They've stopped. - [Brady] Sacred burial ground. - What's it mean? - [Brady] It means they don't get to kill us. But they can. [yelping] - Boys, boys! Boys, I brought the hard candy. Salt water taffy, all the way from Ocean City, New Jersey. The shores of the great eastern ocean, it's the best in the world, and tobacco, shiny, direct from Havana, Cuba. [speaks foreign language] You can chew it or smoke it. [speaking foreign language] Sure have changed, used to be a little tobacco'd go a long way with these boys. [speaking foreign language] - What are they saying? - The little one wants to kill us right now, the big one says he has to take us to Sitting Bull, let him decide. - I like the big one. [speaking foreign language] - What are they saying now? - You don't wanna know. - Oh come on, Bill, what are they saying? - They're arguing over who gets your scalp. - You're right, I didn't wanna know. [speaking foreign language] [eerie music] - At last it is the day of the grizzly. Once when the grizzly was a cub, he is nearly killed except for a white man who saves him. Now the grizzly has found the same white man, and saves his life. [horse neighs] I was that cub. We are even, Brady Hawkes. - Iron Dog. [speaking foreign language] - Yeah. - You fight for your land and you fight for your people. And I respect that. But you've been accused of killing a homesteader and his wife. - I am as guilty of killing this man and his woman as the men who are hanged for doing it. My people do not kill white farmers. But your people hang innocent men. - I believe you. That's why I'm here. - When my warriors came to the house, they found it burned, the man and his woman dead. There was a child. It was still alive. - And they took this child to the Boatwrights, and Billy was there. He says they wore war paint. Why? - They were on their way to our camp, to join in the ghost dance. - Why do you forsake the ways of the grandfathers, and the things the Black Rope taught you? - It is easy to be fair and honest while pointing a rifle at another man's heart. It is easy to be fair and honest and starve my people to death. A white man will call this fair, he will call this honest. He will hang my people and ask me for peace? - Our scouts picked up their trail this morning. Hawkes, his friend, and Buffalo Bill are believed heading for Sitting Bull's camp. - All right, thank you Lieutenant. - Sir. - Could your Sioux police into Sitting Bull's camp. - Hawkes may be a fugitive from us, but his mission is peaceful to the Sioux. - Your police have every right to arrest Hawkes, and Montana and Buffalo Bill as well. - Senator, if I send my police in there, even those chiefs that are friendly to the land bill are gonna take it as a war-like act. - Sitting Bull and this Iron Dog could be the biggest obstacle we have in getting that land bill through. Now what are you gonna do about them? - Whatever I do, I'm gonna do on my terms, Senator, in my way. - As to how much of an obstacle Sitting Bull can be. The last time a land bill came up, the government offered a fair price of 50 cents an acre. Sitting Bull personally held the government up by persuading his people not to accept less than $1.25-- - Peebo! - An acre. - When I want your arithmetic, I'll ask for it. [dog barks] I understand, Agent McLaughlin, that you have hopes of seeing yourself being promoted up through the ranks of our government. - Of course I do. - Ah. I'd hate to see an old chief and one renegade Indian ruin such a promising career. [mysterious music] - It all began over 140 winters ago. Can anyone tell me the name of this man with his kite? Yes Small Deer. - Benjamin Franklin? - Very good. The first study of electricity began with Benjamin Franklin and his kite. And now we're going to study about how electricity is going to change your lives, and mine. How are we going to use electricity? And what are you going to use it for? For our homes, for our schools, and for our villages. [glass shatters] [screaming] No, no, you can't take them! Iron Dog, what is it you want here? [indistinct shouting] Let go of me! These children have a right to learn. - They will learn the ways of my people. - Living in the past is not going to save you or your people. - Is that what you teach my children? That it is too late for them to return to the old ways? - Iron Dog, it's too late to turn back. Too many of your people have already begun to live the ways of the white man. - Then let them fight alongside of the white man, and let them die with him. - Iron Dog, we live today, the children live with the tomorrows. - These children will not return to your school. - They must learn what tomorrows will bring them, and how they will live with it. - If they return to this school, I will burn it down. - Go ahead, and if you burn it down I'll rebuild it. And if you burn it down again, I'll build it again with my own hands! [somber music] - When I was a boy of five, I came to sit in your house and learn. I also heard you speak of the future and its promises. What I learned is the promise that one white man makes to another is the lie that he will tell to my people. [mysterious music] - [speaks foreign language], Chief Sitting Bull. [speaking foreign language] This is the finest horse I've ever owned, and he's the best trained too. Brought him all the way from Chicago to give to you. - Ah. [speaks foreign language] Your great white show horse. Ah. - Chief Sitting Bull, I'd like you to meet Mr. Brady Hawkes and Mr. Billy Montana. - Sir. - Mr. Hawkes is a friend of Iron Dog's. - Welcome to our camp. - Gentlemen, you will be made comfortable. If you will excuse us just for a moment, I'd like a word with Sitting Bull alone. - Well sure, Bill. We'll go water the horses, huh? Thank you. It's hard to believe, Brady. Sitting Bull. The man who helped defeat Custer, who went all the way to see the president, who packed 'em in with Buffalo Bill, the last great chief. - These are the last of his followers. He's in a war he doesn't want, and one he can never win. - Here is your fan mail. - Ah. - All of it wanting you to come back to the show. Still a big star. Still a very famous man. You could use your fame to benefit your people. Come to Europe with me. - No. No, [speaking foreign language]. It is too late. Our world is coming to an end. Out there, my people are starving. I will not go off and leave the old and the little children to die. I will not let the young braves fight alone. I would like to believe that my people would have the hope of a better new world. [baby crying] I will fight to return the buffalo. Even die for it. - Friend, the other chiefs are being told of the great benefit that will come to their people if the land bill is signed. They seem to accept that. If the other chiefs do sign, you do not, what will happen to you and your people? - Then there will be no real Indians left but me. Okay, you keep that horse, and when you ride him, think of us, you and me. We were friends. [speaking foreign language] I had a son once. Carson Cody. When he died, it was the saddest day of my life, next to this. I don't think I'll ever see my old friend again. [children shouting] - Yeehaw! [cows mooing] [horse neighs] - Well, look here, it's our Indian schoolteacher. - [Soldier] Ma'am. - How come you're not teaching them little savages to read and write today? Oh, I forgot, that's right. Iron Dog has rung the recess bell, hasn't he? Permanently. - Sergeant Grinder, why aren't these people receiving the amount of cattle that was promised to them? - It's not my business. I hear that the government's cutting back. - You ask me, ma'am, I'd say it's a real waste of good beef. - Nobody's asking you, Private. - If I had my way-- - Bob, help them boys, will you, over there? Hey, get that little spotted calf outta there! - I think there are many cattle missing from the shipment and I intend to find out why. - Cattle wander off, they die on the trail. They disappear. - Not this many. [bell rings] - Now friends, this is only the beginning, and this banquet is just a way for me to say thank you and to show that I appreciate your cooperation. And very soon we'll be giving you your cattle. - Beef on the hook, gentlemen. Prime Texas beef. All part of the continuing responsibility Agent McLaughlin has in feeding the Indians. - This is no good. - What, Charlie, what's no good? - You promised us cattle, more grain. We cannot live like this! - The government sends the cattle, Charlie, you know that. I can't control the shipments or the amount. It's my job to take what arrives here and make sure that it's distributed properly. - What do you want, Charlie, you expect us to bring the buffalo back? - Charlie, if it weren't for the great white father, your people would be starving to death. - Mr. McLaughlin, Morgan of the New York Times. Is it true that the government's ordering another cutback in the amount of beef being shipped to the Indians? - Well, I don't know if that's true, but if it were, it's because the government wants to make the food program more efficient. - These Indians seem to be wanting more grain. Why aren't they getting that? - You asked for grain? Come. Follow me, gentlemen. The red man makes a request, the white man keeps his promise. - Come here, come here! Come and looky here, looky here! Tell you what I'm gonna do. You buy this here plow from me, and I'll throw in this mule for half price. I'm talking about the genuine purebred hard-working sure-footed Malora mule. See his teeth, he ain't a day over three years old, he's good for workin', ridin', or eatin'. - Speaking of sewing. What love lady of the house would begin to use the needle and thread without the protection of this tiny, resourceful, all-purpose thimble! - Let's show America who keeps their promises. There's no finer, more progressive Indian agent in this country than James McLaughlin. - [McLaughlin] Thank you, Senator. - Here, here, please, please. Ease on in here beside us and we'll have our picture taken. Face this way, that's it. And don't move. [flash pops] Easy, huh? [chuckles] [owl hooting] [distant chanting] [eerie music] - Join me. Take the rifle. Let their code and the agent McLaughlin try to stop us. You and I will lead our young men against the soldiers. Our ghost shirts will protect us, and we will kill them all. - I do not believe that anyone who dies can come back to life. - Then I will lead our warriors without you. [trumpet fanfare] - [Billy] Sitting right there, in the back of the bathhouse. - [Brady] Look, I know you've been here a lot of times Billy, but I'd appreciate it if just one time, you'd pay attention to business, okay? Promise. - [Billy] Brady, you can count on me, you know that. [whistling] - Billy! Mr. Hawkes! - Shh. - What are you doing here? You'd best get outta here, the army's looking everywhere for you. - I know. We're real popular all of a sudden. - We're looking for general Miles. We thought maybe you could help us find him. [laughing] - General Miles? - Yeah. Could you go and find him and bring him here to us? - It's real urgent, we need to speak to him as soon as possible. - Well, I think that can be arranged. [trumpet fanfare] - [Brady] General Miles. - Hey, I think we've come at a bad moment. - Maybe we have. - Yeah. - Hawkes, this had better be good. - I think it is, sir. We've just left Iron Dog. - You've seen Iron Dog? - Yes sir. - I got men tracking him from one end of the Black Hills to the other, they ain't seen so much as a teepee, and you've seen him? - And he says he did not kill the McDonald family. Frankly I believe him. - Well if you believe him, why didn't you bring him here with you so he can clear himself? - He's not gonna come in here. You've already hung two innocent men. He's not fool enough to be the third. If I bring him in, it's an Indian's word against the entire military. Everyone already thinks he's guilty. - Hawkes, I'm gonna tell you something. Until somebody proves otherwise, Iron Dog is guilty. I've got no reason to disbelieve the military investigation into this matter. I do have some reason to doubt your intentions, however. You come into my fort, you bust up a saloon, you call my army men liars. I'd put you in jail right now except that you and Buffalo Bill put a big hole in the wall. [splashes] - Reva, what in blazes, that's cold water! And you put out my cigar! - Now Nelson, why don't you hush up and listen to what Mr. Hawkes has to say? - General, I need more time. I'll prove to you that Iron Dog is innocent. But this goes way beyond Iron Dog and his men. I've been to Sitting Bull's camp, I've seen how we're starving his people. We've taken away their food, we've taken away their pride, and we're on the verge of taking away the one thing they got left, their land. You back 'em into a corner, sir, and they are gonna fight. - All right, Hawkes. All right, I'll call off the dogs. But you bring me proof, not hearsay, and I'll overturn every rock in hell to find out who is guilty. Now unless you intend to come in here with me, will you please get the hell outta here? - Yes sir, thank you sir. Reva, get this fine man a fresh cigar. Billy. Billy? - [General] He's not in here. - I'm really leaving this time, General. Billy? - Hi. - You seen Billy? Just looking for Billy. [people giggling] - Oh, hi Brady. [laughing] Oh Brady, I have to tell ya. This, you gotta try this. This is a sure cure for saddle sores. [laughing] I know what I said, Brady, but you tell me, how could anybody look into the eyes of such a beautiful girl and refuse her invitation? - Billy, you are hopeless. General Miles is giving us another chance. He's not gonna take Iron Dog's word for this, he wants proof. The only way we can do that is to find out about this McDonald killing. - Yeah, but we know a lot about Iron Dog, but we, oh darn, but we don't know anything about the McDonalds. - I know one thing for sure. Somebody wanted 'em dead. - Well, we could talk to ooh, Mary Collins. I mean she knew 'em. - It's as good a place as any to start. - They only lived around here for about a year. Tom McDonald was quite a goldsmith. He made this bracelet for me. I'd heard he was thinking about opening a store at the fort once the land bill passed. - They ever have trouble with the Indians in the fort? - Not that I know of. They were very religious people. But like most people new to this part of the country, they spent the first year of their life just learning how to survive. You know, after what iron Dog did at the school, I'm not all that sure that he is innocent. - Well, we'll ride over there and take a look. See what we can find. - Now you ride west over the ridge about five to not more than six miles. That's the McDonald house. Won't be able to miss it, it sits out all by itself on a point. - Well thank you very much for your help, ma'am. [somber music] Judging by these tracks, eight, maybe 10 braves. People never stood a chance. Hey Brady. Looky here. She was a pretty girl. - Yeah, young too. It's a shame, Billy. You know, these people come west hoping for a new opportunity. They become victims of a conflict they have no say in. [Brady sighs] - Brady, could I... - Yeah, it's Sioux all right. - Why would they want to raid this farm? It's not on Indian land, these people couldn't be a threat to the Sioux. Maybe Iron Dog has changed. - I don't think so. All the tracks I see here have shoes on them. - Sure, they army come by and picked up the McDonalds' bodies. - Okay. But if the Indians were here, where are the unshod tracks? I don't see any. - What are you getting at? - That if Iron Dog didn't do this, someone went to a lot of trouble to make it look like he did. [cow moos] What is that? [cows mooing] Well, well, well, look at this. - You know, it could be the McDonalds were killed because they found out someone was stealing government cattle. - More likely because they found out who was stealing them. [gun clicks] - Just hold it right there, boys. - Well, Grinder. [guns clicking] - Just ease 'em on out and throw 'em over there in the dirt. Now you're getting smart. Of course, you are a couple of smart fellas, I'm surprised you let us sneak up on you. Matter of fact, I'm downright disappointed in you, Hawkes. - Yeah, we did that real good. You mighta thought we was real indians. Right boys? - Come on, let's go. - Someone is stealing cattle from the Indians. - Stealing cattle? - I know how many cattle are rationed out to the Indians and today they didn't get all of their beef. - You are aware of the unfortunate government cutbacks. - Yes, I heard your speech. - Mrs. Collins, I am here as a friend to the Sioux. If you have proof of any corruption in the food allotment program, I promise you I'll take it all the way to Washington. - I believe Sergeant Grinder's behind all of this. - You have evidence? - Not now, but I will, and when I do, you'll have something to take back to Washington with you. I'm very grateful for your offer of help. - Not at all. Why Sergeant Grinder? - I've been out here long enough to know why and how the white man steals from the Indians. Grinder hates the Indians. He's found a way to line his own pocket and get back at them all at the same time. He could even be wanting to start an Indian war as well. - Simply adding fuel to what's already happened at the McDonalds'. - I'm afraid so. - I told her you were occupied. - On the contrary, Peebo. I'm pleased she came to see me. - [Peebo] You are? - Oh yes. That gunfighter in Bismarck. - Wade Friendly. - Wade Friendly. [laughs] Get me Wade Friendly. [bird caws] - Well boys, I sure hope these buzzards keep away from you until the sun finishes you off. - [Brady] Grinder, you must sleep well at night. Killing innocent families, stealing food from starving people. - Yep, you done the army real proud, boys. - They can identify us. I say we shoot 'em. - Shoot 'em? You don't think that'll point the finger in the wrong direction, Bob, two men lyin' out here shot? The whole idea is to make it look like Indians. - If you want it to look like the Indians did it, let's scalp 'em, I sure as hell don't trust just leaving 'em here to die. [groans] - Bob. Just follow orders, get on your horse. - Yeah Bob, just get on your horse. Follow orders. - Shut up. [grunts] [grunts] - This, boys, is a symbol of Sioux justice. You were told not to mess in military affairs, it's too bad you didn't listen. [horses whinny] - I don't know what the army's paying them fellas, Brady, but it sure seems like a misuse of government funds. [chuckles] You know Brady, it's not the dying that bothers me. It's the suffering. Takes so long. - Maybe I can solve it then. - What? [gun clicks] Brady. - Sorry Billy. - Brady, no! [gun fires] [cows mooing] [laughing] Sioux justice, huh? [laughs] Here. - What's that? [cows mooing] - I believe it's called a stampede. [dramatic music] [dramatic music] - Who's side are we on here? - Kill me first, before you take possessions of my lands! [dramatic music] - Hi. - Hi yourself. - And if he tried to kill you and Billy once, he'll try again. - As soon as I kill this boy, I'm gonna kill you. - [Billy] He's stealing the cattle. - No son, he's feeding his people. ♪ You've got to know when to hold 'em ♪ Know when to fold 'em ♪ Know when to walk away ♪ And know when to run ♪ You never count your money ♪ When you're sittin' at the table ♪ ♪ There'll be time enough for countin' ♪ ♪ When the dealin's done ♪ You've got to know when to hold 'em, when to hold 'em ♪ ♪ Know when to fold 'em, when to fold 'em ♪ ♪ Know when to walk away ♪ And know when to run ♪ You never count your money ♪ When you're sittin' at the table ♪ ♪ There'll be time enough for countin' ♪ ♪ When the dealin's done ♪ You've got to know when to hold 'em ♪ ♪ Know when to fold 'em ♪ Know when to walk away ♪ And know when to run ♪ You never count your money ♪ When you're sittin' at the table ♪ ♪ There'll be time enough for countin' ♪ ♪ When the dealin's done
