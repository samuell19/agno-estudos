What are you, look at this. Okay, stop. 'Cause right now you're making me look like a clown. Do I look like Bozo to you? Right, give me this and you can get out, bye. Who hired her? I thought I asked for the largest dressing room. This is a box. ♪ The queen is here ♪ ♪ The queen is here ♪ - This is the largest box in the place, right? - Let's try something on. - Try some candy. - I specifically requested no hard candy. Where's my imported chocolate? You know what, having talent wait like this, this is so unprofessional. - So it's gonna be about another 30 minutes or so. - What was that? - Huh? - Uh, listen, why don't you go ahead and have some candy? - I don't want to eat. When I arrive, I want to go on the stage. They're already an hour behind. - All the mints are gone. - Please, get that out of my face. I've got an album coming out.

So y'all gonna let them have my boyfriend's ex announce me? Stupid, that's dumb. Whose idea was this? - You know what?

Cop it, stream it, download it, it's everywhere. - Now, I heard it, I know it's dope. But also I heard that you skipped out on that Christmas special. First of all, it was a whole hour behind and a girl got places to be if you know what I mean. But shout out to my amazing cousin who worked so hard to keep the haters off my back. - Yo, what's up, Christian? That's my boy over there. You know Christian. - Anyway, I'm just super excited to be in the A promoting my new album. - That's dope. Do you got any big plans? - Actually, my foundation does a toy drive back in Birmingham so I'll be there for a few days and we do it in honor of my father. You know, he really loved Christmas. - You know what, I commend you on that one. What's the best gift that you ever received? - Oh, this Ethiopian prince? He gave me a three-karat sapphire ring one year. - An Ethiopian prince? - Oh my God! - You just killing it all over the world, huh? - Well you know, I do what I can do when I can do it. Oh, just kidding. - If you could have any present for Christmas, what would it be? - For Lisa Jay to stay at the top of the charts! How about that? - Well listen folks, you heard it. Lisa Jay is here in the building. We're talking about Flamethrower and we're getting ready to play that first single is called Money Walk. - Oh, make sure you guys stay tuned 'cause I got the Money Walk remix coming up featuring my boy Theramoney Heavy. - Lisa Jay's in the building.

Nah, I'm not doing too much partying with you. Me and the girls, we just gonna party with me girls tonight. Yeah, I'll tell everybody you said hey. Okay, love you, bye. - I know you're excited to see Daryl. - Mmm-hmm, he been gone for three months and he'll be back tomorrow. So I can't wait, you know what that means? - Okay, a few family things before you leave. I sent in the tuition checks for your cousins. Put something on your uncle's books. And, what do you want to do about your cousin Laura's mortgage, she's three months behind. - See, my daddy was the one who kept everybody at bay. But ever since he died, it's like, it's a different family member every week with a certain situation. - I can have Christian tell them that. - No, 'cause I don't want nobody putting me on blast on social media. So tell cousin Laura, I'll catch up on her mortgage. But that's her Christmas gift. - That's her Christmas gift. - All right, where's my gift. - Ah, green bag, Rolex. - Mmm-hmmm. - Red bag, Booblo. White bag,. - Say that again? I like your style. - Oh yeah, yeah. - All right, they gonna love these. How this look, that look good? - Fabulous. - How fabulous? - Times infinity. - Times what, come on. - Times a galaxy of infin, you look great. - That's all right, that's good enough. All right, good night, bye. - Bye! I like that. - Damn it. Boss lady? - Yes? The producers from Elise agreed to do the interview at Lisa Jay's home the day after tomorrow, should I confirm it? - Yes! Christian, since Lisa Jay won't go to New York, Elise has agreed to come to her house to do the interview. Call me. Thank you, Elise, I owe you one. Lisa Jay absolutely adores you and cannot wait to have the opportunity to sit down and talk to you about her charity. See you soon, Paris. Perfect, see now that's what I'm talking about, ha ha! Yes? Chef Sed just called and Lisa Jay still hasn't showed up for the charity bake-off and it's starting now. - What? Mmm-hmm. - Dammit. Lisa Jay? Where the hell are you? Has everyone lost their phones and their minds in the last 24 hours? - Oh, see Paris is burning, huh? - Cute, but it won't work. Where's Lisa? - She's asleep. - Oh, well then maybe she needs an assistant with an alarm clock. - I told Kia to leave her alone. - Listen, the charity bake-off was to make up for the TV show. Two no shows in two weeks is not good. - Yeah, but first week's sales are still projected to be 400 thousand. - Her reputation is tanking. - Uh, I got your message about that. - Yes, now Elise is loved and respected by everyone. So this interview is gonna be exactly what we need to turn things around. Kia, details. Now, Elise is an old friend of mine, okay? So, she's gonna skew the conversation in the right direction, all right? The interview is going to be the day after tomorrow and I want Lisa to talk about her charity and her affinity for giving back during the holiday season and the toy drive. - Toy drive, giving back. - Yes, exactly. Oh, and she needs to be cheerful. I mean like Santa Claus loving, tree lighting, Christmas caroling, kind of cheerful. Hell, she could be draped in Christmas lights as far as I'm concerned. - Now don't you think that's a bit much? - The more cheerful and loving she is, the better. I want it light and I want it fun. Oh, she needs an ugly Christmas sweater. - That's a joke, right? - No. Now Elise adopted two children so make sure there are plenty of presents. - Two kids, got it. - Oh, and decorate. I want this place to look like a Sax Fifth Avenue Christmas display. - I'll call the designer. - Great, now, she already missed the charity bake off. All right, now there is a meet and greet tomorrow with some disabled children at Vi. I will be here to personally make sure that she arrives on time. Thank you. - No, thank you. Good luck with that. - Okay, decorate. - Oh, I just love shopping. It just gives me a rush, you know what I'm saying? - I haven't been shopping for myself in over a year, so-- - Why? No, wait, what is all of this. - Okay, okay. The designers have been here all day. All the head designers have been pictures. It is amazing, ready? Tah dah! - I don't like it. No, it's trash. First of all, I need sexy, I'm sexy. I want silver black balls. This is dated. Do I look dated to you? - No, no, no, no, but it's Christmas and the designers swear that this will pop on television. - I pop. This, no, not so much pop. I want black and silver bulbs. I want, I want, I want something massive. I want something big. I want something that's just dope. I'm dope, all around dope. - You are, however, comma, where am I gonna get black bulbs at this time of night? The crew will be here at 7 a.m., remember? - First of all, the crew's not coming here at 7 a.m. because I want them to come to my condo. And I want them in my personal space so I need you to change everything. Otherwise, you're fired, okay? And get my bags, thanks, bye. - Okay, bye. Okay, black bulbs. - You know I really appreciate it, but you didn't have to decorate the whole house. - Well, your whole house was in dire need of a holiday makeover. - You're like one of Santa's helpers. You could have just said no. - You could have said no. I went looking for black spray paint. Thanks for letting me use your place. My apartment is so small, I would have gassed the entire floor. - You don't even, this stuff is toxic. - Yeah, we have plenty. I could put up a few more. - I don't think I'm gonna be doing too much decorations this year, but thanks. - You okay? - Hey, what can I do to help? - Grab a blow dryer and start drying. - Why would I have a blow dryer? - I don't know. Maybe you're girlfriend or someone special would have one here? - No. - No blow dryer or no one special? - Both. - Okay, well, I'll paint and you can glitter. - I'll paint and you glitter. - Hah hah, okay. - Starting Karen's tidbits tonight is none other than Lisa Jay. What is up with our girl? Now I'm usually a fan, but lately I can not with this girl and her antics. She walked off of the Christmas special leaving all of the organizers frantic at the last minute and guess what? She didn't even show up at a charity event that was benefiting education. But guess what? The night before, she was out giving expensive Christmas gifts, like. So you know, seriously, you have time to give to the rich people but you don't have time for everybody else? Lisa Jay don't love the kids? So listen honey, everybody loves a fun diva moment. But nobody likes a bitch. - Braggo, nothing about me is regular. I don't know what you keep doing this. I'm not wearing nothing off the rack. - You are so predictable. Listen, just-- No! - Oh my goodness, just give me a second! Try it on, perfect. - No, no, no. - Jingle bells, jingle bells-- Need to see that you're normal, honey! - Joy to the World-- - I'll be back in three minutes. Don't come back. - All right, thank you. She's gonna think about it. Oh, red it is. - Now I hear your charity's doing things all year round. Tell us a little bit about that. - Yes, my foundation. We help thousands of families all over Birmingham, Alabama, which is my home town by the way. We sponsor back-to-school drive, we give away turkeys for Thanksgiving, and we do a free concert for graduating seniors. - That's great! - What's great is we do this big toy drive every year! We go give back to four different communities and two foster homes. I like to think that every kid should wake up to something for Christmas, you know what I mean? - That is beautiful! - Thank you, oh. You know what's beautiful? I heard you adopted two little ones. - I did, I have twin girls! - Oh, that's so sweet. Now, a lot of people don't know this but I'm adopting. - Really? - This is perfect, the audience is gonna eat this up and all will be forgiven. - And I like to go back to that very same foster home I grew up in to play Mrs. Claus. So I applaud you for adopting. - Well I applaud you for not just having this charity but for really being so personally involved. - You welcome. Before I forget, I got something for your little ones. - Oh you got them a gift? That's so sweet. - No, this is better than gifts. - What happened to the stuffed animals and the books? - I don't know. - You don't know? - You know about this? - Do I look like I knew about this? - I got them $5,000 so they can ball out. Oh, take it! - Wow, okay, well, they're only six years old. - That's okay, they gonna ball! - That's a lot of balls. But it's also very generous. So thank you. - You're welcome. - And I want to thank you for opening up your home and giving us a glimpse into what it's like spending the holidays with you. I'm Elise and thank you for watching. - Merry Christmas! Feliz Lavedah! How'd I do? - We'll talk. She came across insensitive and materialistic. I don't know what else to do? - So what, you're the queen of spin. - Well, she is unspinnable. - Listen, I talked to her after you and Elise left. - Really? And what did she say? - Books? Teddy bears? That is so cheap! - It's endearing. The book talks about adoption in both of the kid's name. Didn't you see that? You should have just handed her the envelope and not said anything. - Well, I didn't want her to sit that money down somewhere and losing it. - Hold on, wait, wait, wait. You gave her cash? - Kids don't like gift cards! They like dollar bills. - She gave Elise $10,000 in cash? - I understand that she is just out of control superstar, aright? But you gotta admit, it's not affecting her sales. - Really? That's because women can't have a bad boy image in the industry. They don't expect it. It's a damn double standard. - The good part is that Daryl's in town and she'll be laying low for a couple of days. - Oh. - Then she's going to Birmingham. - Oh wow, great. So now I got a whole week to do damage control, really? - Let's not forget. This is the same woman who went to Oha's infamous garden party with a sheer blouse and her nipples showing. So she's come a long way. - Yeah, yeah.

Let's get this dinner. - I'm gonna need my energy. - Oh stop, how was your flight? - I couldn't get here fast enough to see you. - I know, it's like our schedules all crazy. You're here, I'm there. It's just a lot. - When you leaving? - Saturday, you coming with me? - I can't. But, at least we have three days of uninterrupted time before you leave. - I like the sound of that. - Come to daddy. Come over to daddy's lap. First, I want to talk to you about something. - What's up? - First thoughts when you see her? - She tall, what? - We don't get to see each other much as we like, right? - Mmm-hmm. - So I want to talk about this thing we got going on. - You mean, this thing called relationship? - Yeah, relationship. You know, maybe you could see other people too. But, you would be my East Coast girl for sure. - You serious right now? - Unless you want to spice things up, I'm sure she'd be down. - You good brother? You a dog, that's what you are. - Your limo driver's on the way, but anything else I can get you in the meantime? - Oh that's what? That's what it is. - Sorry about that, I got you. Oh, you seeing her. - Most guys wouldn't have even asked. - I don't have to take none of this from you. Do you know who I am? You know how many dudes would be all up at my feet right now? - Keep your voice down. - No, you keep your voice down. Are you serious right now? You know what time it is when I lay down. - Don't talk about what you laying down. You're not laying down nothing. You're trash. - These pumps and thrusts are like no other. - I don't even wanna hear it. I don't wanna talk about it right now. - Nobody can hold this shit. - Shut up! - Excuse me, I'm sorry, excuse me! I am the owner of this restaurant, is there a problem? - Caleb? - Lisa? - What's up, bro? I'm Daryl. - Don't touch him. Did you just say owner? - I did. - Good, kick him out. - You the owner? - I am. - This salad is dry as hell. - You dry. I wasn't talking to you. - All right sir, if you have a problem with the service, and that's fine, but there is no need to insult the food nor the lady. - All right well, she's paying for it. I'm not paying for nothing. - You pay for it. You pay for it. - Just like I paid for everything else. - Okay, all right, sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. - No, Christian. I did not get kicked out of the restaurant. Just the dining room. What, I don't care what they posted. No, I don't feel like talking. I'm gonna call you back. - You okay? That was your boyfriend in there, right? - Yeah, shoulda known better. You know, he always had women all over him. But it is what it is. - Mmm-hmm. You mind? - What? Oh, it's a habit. - There you go, that's better. You know, I'm pretty sure you had your pick of the litter too when it comes to men. - I dunno, it was harder than you think. Enough of that. I didn't know you went from promoting parties to owning your own restaurants. - Oh, it's just one restaurant for right now. Three of my friends, we invested. And my homegirl is a chef. And we've been in business for about a year now. We do all right. - Well, you should have called me, text me, DM me, something, you know? - Oh please, I ain't seen you in forever, I mean, besides TV. And I don't really do social media. - Well, I coulda came and got you a ton of press, you know? - But you're here now. So it's all good. Lisa Jay, man, hey, you remember our hand shake? You remember it? - Yeah, I remember it. - Let me see it. Yeah! - I can't believe you still remember that. - Of course I remember it. I still even remember promoting at your first gig at Alabama A&M. Remember that? - Yes. - Yeah, it was like 20 kids that showed up. - And the DJ couldn't find my track. I was so mad. - But you still killed it. It's Lisa Jay is what they say and if you walk this way you just know I don't play. Bam! You were so passionate. - Yeah, I was. I mean, I still am. It's just, a lot to think about now, you know? - Yeah. I'm sure it is, super star. - Okay, uh, I'm gonna go. But, next time I'll post something about your business. It'll boost it like crazy, trust me. - Actually, we have a pretty dope marketing team, so. I think I'm good. I mean, of course I would welcome the free publicity. But, don't feel obligated. - Well, you should name a drink after me and call it the Red Headed Diva. I'll post that. - Okay, I'll keep that in mind. - Yeah, I gotta go. - All right well, you have my card. You should come by and have dinner some time, on me. It was great seeing you. - Likewise. Ah, you got an exit? - Oh yeah, of course, right this way. - Music super star Lisa Jay fights with boyfriend, Daryl Stokes, causing disruption and mayhem for patrons merely trying to enjoy their holiday meal. - Well, you wanted them to stop talking about the show, right? - It seems that the hip hop diva has now been coined as the new grinch that stole Christmas. - Come on now, does that really even make sense? - You know, I wish I could laugh but you know who sent me this, my old boss, Rick. - He's probably the one who wrote it too. - Now, she paid for everyone's meal that night. Did anyone post that? - Yes, actually, there's a Mrs. Deeds who posted a lovely picture of a paid receipt. Two of her 23 followers commented. But you know what? This is actually a good thing. Because nothing distracts people more than a messy breakup. Oh, it's a great PR spin. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm moving on to Operation B, take Daryl Stokes down. - And uh, you got all this in one night? - Uh huh, I could take down Congress in a week. - Oh, so you Olivia Pope now, huh? - I will do whatever it takes to take a bad light out from our client and shine it on to someone else. - I heard that. - Before you say anything, it's not my fault. - Oh no, no, no. I moved on to plan B. - Well, plan B includes a new gig for New Years Eve because I'm not going to Bora Bora with Daryl. - I got you, sis. So we're going to the studio to record that remix. We're gonna be there for a little while. You want to stop by? - Uh huh, I got work to do, hah hah! - So do we. - Oh, is there such a thing as a Christmas dis record? - No. - Yo, we've had tons of requests for the Red Headed Diva. Is that some kind of online promotion? - Just have the bar tender put a pineapple lime twist on a Strawberry Cosmo. - Cool. My man.

This necklace is very special to me, my dad gave it to me. It's the least I can do. Take it home for Christmas. I don't care what you do with it, it's yours. - My family wouldn't know the difference. - So you are going back home for Christmas. You're parents still at the same house? - Yep, my mom is having a Christmas brunch this year. You okay? - Uh, this is my publicist. Mind if I? - Yeah, yeah. - What Paris? - Hah, I just sent you over a list of names. - For what? - Plan C, your options. You can pick whomever you like, number four is the best. They would all love to date you and the two of you will make your first appearance this Friday at Future's Christmas party. - This Friday I'm going to Birmingham. - Well, the toy drive is Sunday. - Right, but I'm spending time with my granny. So, no. - Wait, you mean to tell me that while Daryl Stokes is out kanoodling with his fine, young fot, you're gonna be what? Quilting with your granny? - I don't care about Daryl's sorry ass. Don't call me with that. I just, no, I'm taking a high road. - Okay, you know where a high road is gonna take you? To the road of obscurity. You need a man. - Bye, Paris. - You need a man. Dammit. - Man. See how chaotic my life is? - Yeah, I see. Eh, I'm gonna be in Birmingham this Friday too. My nephew having a birthday party. - Oh dope! We should link then! - Yeah for sure.

I just gotta wrap this up, all right? - I'm sorry, look, text me the address, I'll be there. I'm sorry, I'm coming! - Now I don't know why she didn't tag him. - So you're just gonna change clothes on us, huh? - Boy stop. Granny, what happened to dad's star? - Oh, I couldn't get it to light up. Here, you're on decorating duty. - Um, I haven't done this in forever, so no thanks. - I can help with that. - Oh good, you know what else you can help with? The yard decorations. Especially those inflatables. - Yep, I can help you with that too. Well, we can help you with that. - Uh, we? Nah, I'm good, thanks. Hold on, excuse me. Paris, what? - Why haven't you responded to my text? Who's making you smile and why didn't you tag him? - Take a break. - Oh God, he doesn't have a lot of followers, does he? Oh God, how can we spin it? How can we spin this? Oh you know what, we can buy you followers. We can buy him followers. - Listen, first of all, I'm decorating cookies with my grandmother so bye. - Mmm mm, mmm mmm, we're gonna buy followers, first. Lisa Jay! Ugh, God. Dammit. $500? - Oh, now that's how the tree's suppose to look! I always knew you were special. - You hear that? Granny Fran says I'm special. - Boy shut up, here. Put that in your mouth. Okay, all right, relax, here. What you bumping now what you bumping now? Boom, boom. - Check it, check it, check it, we wish you a merry Christmas, we wish you a merry Christmas, we wish you a merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. - What? - Okay, okay, I see you, okay. - Now you see all the fun you would have missed out on by taking car service? - I know, I know, it was dumb, it was dumb. It was fun, if not more, so yeah. I'll give you that one. - Exactly. - All right, I got a confession. - What's up? I'm all ears. - Man, I'm embarrassed to say it. - What? How you gonna say you got a confession? Go ahead, say what you gotta say. - I started promoting you because I used to rap. Yup, I had a crew, I had background dances, the D.J., the whole nine yards. We did a few shows, a few parties. See, that's why I didn't want to tell you. - Okay, okay. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, go ahead. Go on and finish. - That's exactly why I didn't want to tell you. - I'm sorry. Go ahead, go ahead. - Oh man, I had to give that up quick though 'cause I kept getting stage fright. Man, it was the worst. I would get up there and I would start rapping and forget the lyrics and then I would stuttering and my hands would start shaking and I'd start sweating. It was horrible. - That's terrible! - But then I saw you on stage. And you had this, this electric, raw talent. And I knew right then and there that I would devote everything that I had to making sure that somebody made it who deserved the chance. And that somebody was you. Aiite, so that's my confession. Your turn. - Oh, oh, we doing that now? Okay. So, my confession is that I always wanted to be rich, famous, and fabulous. Dreams really do come true. Look at God looking out for me and all of this. Oh sorry, where are we? - We're at one of our old hangouts. - Come on, get out. - Uh, okay. - You good? - I'm fine. - Just making sure you're cool. - This way.

You don't have to say anything. It's cool. - Cool. What's this? I found it behind the record player. - Granny Fran, why is this still here? - 'Cause your daddy never threw anything away. Awe-- - Look at this. - I remember you told your daddy you had found this guy. He was gonna send you all around the world and he was gonna make you famous. - Yep, that was me. - And then he showed up in this beat up old raggity car. Didn't even have no hub caps on it. - That was you, all right. - We said oh my goodness, this one don't have a pot to piss in. How in the world is he gonna make our baby famous? - But I did. I made her Birmingham famous. - I'm going to the casino with Mr. Charlie. But I'll see you in time for the toy drive tomorrow. - Uh, Granny Fran, who is Charlie? - Nevermind who Charlie is. You just take care of my baby, Caleb. - You know I will. - You know this guy she's seeing? Charlie? - Yep, if I ain't know better, I'd think Granny Fran was gonna get her some holiday booty. I'm just saying. Yo, who is this in this picture with this Jerry girl? - That's me. - No, not you, who's the guy? - Oh, that's my dad. I was seven and that was Christmas Eve. And that was the day my adoption was finally official. First time I ever felt like a real Christmas. Man, I was on Cloud Nine. - Who is this lady? - Oh, that's my biological mom, Olivia. She died a couple days after I was born. She ain't really have family, so that's how I ended up in the system. - But your dad knew her though, right? - They were best friends. And once he found out what happened to me, he looked into adopting me. - I remember your pops. He was cool but he did threaten me one time. - No he didn't. - Yes he did. He told me he would kill me if I ever touched you. - Is that why you never hollered at me? - Hell yeah! Shit, he was holding a 45 when he said it. - No he didn't. - I'm telling you. - Yeah right. - What happened here? How'd you break your leg? - Skiing. Every Christmas we would do something either I was afraid to do or he was afraid to do. - What you mean? - My dad always had this saying that every year shouldn't pass without tackling something you're afraid of. You see how that turned out. So, as the years passed, I held a snake once, we went fishing at night, rode on a hot air balloon, those were the good 'ol days. - Wow, that's powerful. - Yeah, my daddy always found ways to empower me. I remember the first time I told him I wanted to take over hip hop and I was so scared of what he might say. And then he gave me this necklace. And then he said baby girl, always go after whatever it is your heart desires because God put them there on purpose. And if I ever die on myself, hold this close. Those were his words. My dad always gave the greatest gifts. - Yeah, it sounds like it. - You wanna know my confession? The other day when I was at the radio station, J.R. asked me what was the best gift I ever got for Christmas and I told him this stupid sapphire ring. But what I should have said was my dad was my greatest gift. - So here's the papers you want Lisa to sign. How you doing? - Ugh, I got great news. - You got the endorsement. - Not yet, but guess who has a crush on our girl? - Jaden Row. - Really? - Mmm hmm and he's gonna be in town for six months shooting the movies so I'm hooking them up. This is going to take our media plan to a whole 'nother level. - Yeah, but what if she don't like him? - It's Jaden Row, even I like him. - She's getting into acting. So this could be the perfect time. - Oh, and they're going to look amazing on the red carpet. - She's gonna know audition coming. Maybe you can help her out. - I'm already on it. Look, a guest-starring role in a feature film. Baby the press is gonna eat it up. - Yeah, you did good this time. - This time? - Yeah, this time. By the way, Kai left this at the house for you. - Kai? - Yeah, Kai, the assistant Kai. - You know, I saw a little twinkle in your eye when you said her name. - I don't twinkle. - Mmm-hmm, well, something happened when you said her name. Now if it wasn't a twinkle then it must have been a sparkle. - I'll talk to you later. - Uh huh, onward Christian soldier! - Bye, Paris. - It was some glitter, baby. - Do you have a reindeer? - Nope, go fish. Okay, I see what you're getting at. Lights out. I win. - Oh no, oh no. Not again. I'm sick of this. - Lisa, you're terrible at cards-- - Oh whatever-- - And you should stop while you're ahead. - You're trash. - I'm gonna whoop you again. - I'm right. - I only got four cards, I need one more. - You only gave me four too. You're trash at this game. - I've been drinking a little bit. - I know. All right-- - Where did your granny get these cards from anyway? - Who knows, I think they're from her Sunday School kids. You got a little something on your face. - Don't laugh at me, get it off. What you laughing at? Stop trying to cheat? - Me? - Yeah, you. I see you trying to look at my hand. - No-- - Uh huh, what if I try to look at your cards. Let me see what you have in your hands. No, let me see, let me see 'em. - That was weird. - It wasn't weird for me. - Your turn. - I'm gonna kiss you again. - Wake up. Did we just? - Yes, why the hell you hitting me like that? - Why, this wasn't suppose to happen! - Oh no, no, no, just look, it was good to finally see you with your guard down. - Sir, everything was down. It's not funny. - Listen, listen, listen to me. I know you're always worried about people taking advantage of you but not me. Hey, I would never do that to you. - I know. - I mean, unless you wanted me to take advantage of you-- - Stop. - Again. I'm more than happy to oblige. - Don't you have to go to Atlanta? I got a toy drive to go to. - So... Granny Fran, Granny Fran. Get your, where are my panties, where are my panties? Where are my pants? Where the hell are my pants? - Oh, am I interrupting something? - Hey, Granny Fran. How was the casino? Did you get lucky? - Did you? - Put your pants on. All right, you got everything you want for Christmas? You sure? Yes. 'Cause if you didn't, I want you to let me know, okay? - Excuse me, Lisa Jay. I just wanted to thank you so much for the gifts. I'm so excited that they let us open two before Christmas! Can you come to our movie night before Christmas Eve? - Um, I'm sorry, you know, I got stuff to do. But, I'll post a picture-- - Yeah! Got it. - Thank you so much. - You're welcome. - Can you braid my hair today? - Um, I don't do hair, I bring toys? - Ebony, your hair is fine. - But I want my hair braided before Christmas. - Oh, sorry. - It's okay, hey cutie. You good? All right! Ho ho ho! - Santa! - Our Santa Claus is black. - What are you doing here? I thought you had to work in Atlanta? - I got a call from the North Pole that said I needed to be here. And I hear you've all been good little kids this year. Oh, I got hugs, more hugs, I love it, thank you. Oh here, I got something for you. One for you and another one for you! Okay, here you go. Merry Christmas. Thanks, Santa. Your welcome, merry Christmas. - Thank you. ♪ Silent night ♪ ♪ Holy night ♪ ♪ All is calm-- ♪ - You know, this is the nicest thing anybody has ever done for me, right? - I didn't do that for you. I specifically got a text from the North Pole that told me to come through, so. I guess I was just following orders. - I have the surprise for you! Guess who's here? - Can I get a high five? Here you go, here you go. - Jaden, Jaden, Jaden. - Lisa Jay, do you know? I've always felt a strong connection towards you and that's why as soon as I discovered you had this amazing charity I just wanted to do something, you know? So I'm personally here to give you a check for $25,000. Now I'm hoping this will help with the Hayes Foster Home and the families here in Birmingham. And I'd also like to ask if I can take you out for dinner, tonight. - Oh, tonight tonight? - Tonight. - Of course, she'd love to go to dinner. - Um-- - Everything okay, or? - No, no, no, no, no, you're good. I'm flattered, give me one second, okay? Let me think about it. - Lisa, she doesn't handle emotion well. - Okay, that's what, okay. - She's totally fine. I do. Children! Who wants to take a picture with Lisa! - Caleb, Caleb, wait! I am so sorry. - No, it's fine. It's Jaden Row, I get it. Who wouldn't be excited? - Listen, Paris always does these off the whim things. I don't know what she was thinking and I honestly didn't know. - I came here to help and I did. I really got to get back to Atlanta. - Well thank you for everything. I really appreciate it. - Of course. - Lisa Jay! Lisa Jay! Jaden's here. - I'm sorry, I gotta go. - Later, my friend. - I'm sorry honey. Were you playing Santa? Girl I had that. Come on, you're a star baby! We got this. Ah, he's waiting. - Here girls, all right, get out of here. Here you go. - This looks good, thank you. So Paris tells me you was raised as a foster child. I didn't realize we had so much in common. - Oh, you were in the foster program? - Oh yeah, well, not in real life. But, I've been in two movies where I played the role of a foster child and I've done extensive research so I feel like I can really relate to what they go through. I feel your pain. - Okay, that's totally different, but. I'm sure you get an inkling of an idea. - A little bit. But let's just be real. I'm Jaden Rowe. You're Lisa Jay. We can have anyone we want but right now it's all about power moves. - I agree, you gonna eat your pizza? - Have a little bite, I guess. This is good. - I'm back. - Good, you're back. Now I know it's not Christmas yet, but I have something for you. - What is this? - Just a little something. You remember when you was 10 years old and you wanted a bracelet with your name on it so bad you cried so hard but we couldn't find one anywhere? - They always said Janet or Jennifer but never Jalisa. - Now, I know you can afford just about anything you want but the best gifts are those wrapped in love. - No matter where you go always remember you are raised daughter, Fran's granddaughter, and God's child. Surround yourself with those who lift you and love you always, merry Christmas, Granny Fran. Thank you, granny. - Merry Christmas, baby. - Merry Christmas, granny. - Daryl Stokes in trouble for tax exemptions. I swear, Paris is relentless. - Do you miss him? - I miss other things. - Whoa. - Honestly, I think that's all it was for him. - Well, at least you have Jaden Row. And this picture that he posted of the two of you has over 50,000 comments. Maybe you should take him to Bora Bora. - Maybe. - And the stuff with you and Caleb has comments too. - This is him in the Santa suit, right? - Yeah, he came to surprise the girls. - That's so sweet. - I know. I need to thank him. - I'm gonna go online and order him-- - No, no, no you know what? I got a better idea. Call Christian and tell him to meet us at the studio. - Okay, Christian. You're a fine ass. Wine glass, beautiful. - Oh yeah, so-- - The bar tender told me to come on back. - Yeah, I told him you were on the way. - Trey, this is Lisa Jay. - Hey Trey, nice to meet you. I wanted to thank you for what you did in Birmingham. - Wait, wait, wait, is this the lady you were talking about? - You were talking about me? - No. - Yes! - Yes or no? What'd he say? - Well he was just telling me every... Um, I think I should just give you two a moment. - Oh no, we're actually getting ready to leave, you're good. - No, I got work to finish. - Nope, you don't. Come on, let's go. - Rain check. - The car is waiting so no rain check. Let's go. - You can't keep the car waiting. - That's right so let's go. Get your coat even though you're not gonna need it. Bye Trey. - Damn. - That's real good, man. Well, hope y'all ready. - What's he talking about? - You always said you wanted to be a rapper and get in the booth, so we're gonna create a classic. - We should turn it up. - I got work to do, I can't be here all night. - Um, sir, I got work to do too. So I'm not trying to be here all night with you either. - I'm not trying to be here all night with neither one of y'all. So get to work. - I brought you all the way here, you're gonna do something.

No problem. - Oh God, I wish I had clothes like this in my closet. - Um, Jaden stayed over last night. Don't get too excited. We literally sat on the couch and talked till morning. - What did you talk about? - Him, his career, his family, I never met somebody who was just so self-absorbed. It's a lot. - Really? Well, did you mention Bora Bora. - I did, he's never been so he's excited. - Oh, well you and Jaden seem to be quite the it couple. Like, Paris really thinks you're going to the Oscars this year for sure. - Oh, now that's what I'm talking about. - And what's really cool is that you like him. Right? - Yeah, he's nice. - You do like him, right? - Enough about me. What's up with you and my cousin Christian? - Oh, you know, I've given him a few hints. - Okay, enough with the hints. Why don't you just tell him how you feel? - Is that Jaden making you smile like that? - Um, get out of my business. - Okay, well this is nice. - Okay, go find Traci. - Okay, Traci! - Are you trying to surprise me with a date? - Not at all. Just trying out a few new things for my menu and wanted your opinion. Okay, you can call it a date. - Let's not give it a title. - Okay, here try this. A Red Headed Diva for the red headed diva. Huh? - Okay, okay, exquisite, exquisite! - Yeah, like the woman who inspired it. - Okay, tell me about these dishes. - Okay, but first I have a proposal. I know it's a little different but just hear me out. So I overheard you telling Christian that you didn't have anything planned for New Years Eve and I thought, you know, it might be really dope if you went back down to Birmingham and did a show at the 501. For old times sake. - 501, that's a hole-in-the-wall. - Well you performed there 10 years ago on New Years Eve. It was the last show that we did together. - I don't know if you know this or not but my appearance is a hundred grand. Double that New Years Eve. - Right, you know what? Don't worry about it. It was just a thought. I mean, it was for charity, but it's all good. - I mean, I won't be here anyway. Imma be in Bora Bora. - Oh, so you are performing? - Vacation. - Gotcha. So you won't be alone. Jaden Row? Cool, so what's up with y'all? - We just chilling, we hanging, we getting to know each other, you know? - You ain't gotta go to the other side of the world to get to know somebody. - Okay sir, I don't owe you an explanation. - My bad. - I think I should go. - Is everything you do a publicity stunt? - I'm sorry, what? - I'm just curious. - Don't you dare judge me. So what if I gotta do things that's for my brand. I can't be like you and just live out my whims. I got people criticizing and judging me every single day. You don't know what that's like. - So were you pretending with me at the studio? At the house? - I took you to the studio as a thank you. - Nah, you did that to make up for what you did back home. And then you use it as a chance to show off your generosity. - Didn't I make your dreams come true? You rock 'em! You know how many people would die to come in the studio with me? - And here are you proving my point. - You know what? People are so jealous and so ungrateful and you're one of them. You just want what I got. - I want what you got? - Yeah. - Please tell me what you have. Let me guess, a bunch of fake ass industry friends and some phony relationships? Is that what I want? - You gotta show up in a Santa suit and making me cookies at my grandma house. What is that about, huh? Clearly, you trying to be all up in my world. - The hell with your world. I don't give a damn about none of that. I was trying to spend time with you. But you know what? I'm the stupid one for trying to spend time with a ghost. 'Cause the person that I remember? She died a long time ago. - Bye, Caleb. Chris! You think I'm superficial? I was told today I only do nice things for people so I can go out and get the glory for it. - I think when you have money it's easy to get confused. But I know you mean well. - My gifts make people happy, don't they? - Last Christmas you got Kai a fur coat. - A fur-trimmed mink ballero coat, which I've never seen her wear. - That's 'cause she's on the board for PITA. I'm just saying. And your masterpiece, it's starting to grow on me. But that was more your taste than mine. - But I got good taste. - See, what's what I'm saying. It wouldn't hurt for you to be a little more thoughtful and endearing. - What like, getting you some real expensive desert besides this cheap burnt marshmallow. - Man, that's just something me and my little man do annually, you know what I'm saying? I'm just starting to miss him, that's all. Listen, I know you got a good heart. Just hard to hear under all the designer clothes and furs, your hair. - What's wrong with my hair? - It's CJ! Hey CJ! - Hey! - Hey CJ! - Hey Aunt CJ! - Boy, you getting so big! You so cute! - Thank you! - I love you! - I love you too! - Hey man, it is so good to see you. I've been hearing, I've been hearing some good things about you, man. I heard that you had straight A's in school, is that true? - Yes sir. - Nice, nice, nice. Maybe I won't be the one to put some coal inside your Christmas presents this year. You'll get some actual gifts! Coal? - I hope I see you very soon, son. - Thank you. May all your days be as wonderful as your first Christmas, love Caleb. The best gift is wrapped in love. Hey Kai Kai, look, I got a dress that's being altered. Can you stop by Cash? They close at six. Okay, I'll hurry, I promise it's the last thing I'll ask of you until after the new year. I'm kinda rushing so it's an emergency. It's fine. And, drop it by the house when you're done. Got it. Bye. Bye. - Look, if you want her to endorse your wine, then you're gonna have to give her some ownership. Okay, then find her someone who hasn't won four Grammy's, three AMAs, and too many BET awards to count. That's what I thought. All right, well I'll be expecting that contract tomorrow, buh bye. - I swear the only difference between you and a pit bull are your two karat diamond earrings. - So you coming to thank me for closing that beauty endorsement? - No, I came to tell you I'm on my way to the airport. - But your flight doesn't leave for another four days. - I changed it and it does not include Jaden Row. - What? - I wanted to tell you before you heard about it in the media or the blogs, so there you have it. - Wait, wait, wait, you're kidding me, right? - Merry Christmas. - Lisa, Lisa don't be playing with me. Dammit. Lisa! - You could have at least talked to me. This makes no sense. Okay, would you just give me a minute, listen to me? Jalisa, ugh, Jalisa, Jalisa all right, don't post, okay? Just go silent for a week and then I can spin this into you needing a mental sabbatical after a very busy year. What is going on with you? Why are you acting so odd? Is this about that Caleb person? Okay, you know trying on for Christmas with Caleb after the whole world just saw you sipping Peppermint McCoCo with Jaden is gonna make you look like a ho ho ho. - Actually, this is about you. - What? - Wait, why are you here? Wait, wait, what is this? Why are you here? - I changed the flight registry, I change the hotel reservations, I want you to enjoy Bora Bora. - I packed our bags. - What? This is not part of our media plan. - Listen, I appreciate everything you do for me. I appreciate you riding for me. But, I don't want you to take the one you love for granted. Enjoy your vacation, bae. - Okay, how did you know I was going follow you out of that office? - You're not the only predictable one in this relationship. - Thank you. - You deserve it. - Oh, but seriously, do not mess things up with Jaden. - All right all right, merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. - Let's go, baby. - No, no, no she gonna be so mad, God. Hey, hey, it's not 6:00 yet! Anybody in there, hello? Please, my Christmas wish, open the door! Yes, ah, woo! - Kai, we have been expecting you. - Thank God, I'm here for the dress. - Okay, she left this for you. - Okay. You're right, when you buy something different you pretty much gotta revamp your entire wardrobe. Enjoy the new you. Merry Christmas. - Lisa Jay. - She hired us to give you a makeover. - Me? - Yes, and with the credit she put down, you can have whatever you want in the store. - Whatever I want in the store? - Yes. - This jacket here? - Yes. - Do you have this in heather gray? - We have it in the back. - Too, it's okay, okay I'm ready, oh my God! We can start right here. - Let's do it! - Wow. - Hi. - You look nice. - Thank you. - I wanted to give you another Christmas present. ♪ Just being honest the thought of you takes me there ♪ ♪ You're the star of the midnight ♪ ♪ Girl you make me feel right ♪ ♪ Nothing ever could compare ♪ ♪ Like a flower ♪ - You're the present? - Merry Christmas. Oh my God, how embarrassing. I knew this was too much, I knew it! The lip, the leather-- Kai, Kai Kai. No, it's actually perfect. You're beautiful. - Thank you. - Can I make you a drink? - Sure. - Make yourself at home. - All right, you are all done. - Yay, how does it look? - Fabulous darling! - All right you guys, who's ready for the Christmas Eve movie night? - Daddy! Oh! Oh, I missed you so much. - I missed you too. - Now you know I got a little surprise for you. - What is it? - It's upstairs, go check it out. Tiara, this is quite a surprise. - I'll be back to get him in a couple of days. - Well, I just wanted to let you know how much this means to me. So thank you. - You're welcome. - Where'd you get that purse? - Eh, it was a Christmas present. - Christmas? Thank you again. - No problem. - Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. - As long as you can make the potato salad. Hello, Lisa? Yeah, sorry. Um, the other day when you said you didn't want to be friends, I heard you loud and clear, but-- - Somebody get the door! - I'll get it. I don't know if that works for me. - But what if things were different? Different how? Hold on one second. Hey y'all, come on. My mama in the kitchen, go ahead. I'm back. So different like how, Lisa. - I don't want you to be friends with Lisa Jay. - Lisa, where's your... You look so beautiful. What are you doing here? - I know it's Christmas and I wanted to try something I'm afraid of. - So you're afraid of being here with me? - No, being comfortable with who I am. And, you helped me realize that. You and my dad, actually. This might sound crazy but I think you're my dad's Christmas present. - Oh don't do that, don't cry. It's Christmas. - I know, I know. But everything just started adding up: the necklace, the box, the star, the picture. And he sent you. - Doesn't sound so crazy to me. I mean, you always said that your dad gave you the best gifts, right? So... - I was hoping maybe you want to hang out with Jalisa Renee Jefferies because she could really use a friend like you.
