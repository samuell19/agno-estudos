Parents in discussion at the background. Thomas... How many times I have told you not to drink the milk out of the container like an animal? And take that thing out of your ear. Now you are going to drink your milk, out of the glass. Tommy, not again. Drink it! Come on! All of it! Drink it down. Faster and stop spilling it on yourself. What's the matter with you? Can't remember a simple rule? Not from the container, you drink from the glass. Now you are going to drink your milk like a human being. Till you learn. Drink it! Come on! When your dad told you to do something... you do it! Drink it! Don't you dare spit it out. Alright!!! Why do you stop? Now clean it up. All of it! Clean it up! Tommy, why are you make me doing this to you? It's all your damned fault. Over and over again, we've tried to be good... We have tried so far. It's for your own good. Someone got to teach you... teach you to behave... Someone got to teach you what it means to be decent, and to be clean, and to be considerate of other people for the same. And not disobey your parents, and simply, to mature! Well, what happened to him? Has Thomas had a convulsion like this before? No never! - Not at all! Is he allright? He is resting now. Did he fall recently? Off his bike, playing at school? Let me see a clue that could cause a concussion. I don't know. He didn't mention any. Maybe it's something he ate. - Yeah! He's always eating between meals, junk food. Dr. Krapp, please call the operator. Dr. Krapp, please call the operator. Okay, thank you. Mmmm... popcorn bruises... And the neck is burned. And junk food marks. Hey Thomas... How are you buddy? Okay. My name is Dr Bennett. You are in the hospital. But don't worry. Just relax. Everything will be fine. They are gone. I wanne take some X-rays of you. Horton School of Social Research, may I help you? Yes, I have to leave a message for a student in the film department. It's quite urgent. Sorry, I can't take messages for students. Well, he's a Master's Degree candidate. Larry Porter, the experimental cinema program? Oh, that guy in the weird T-shirt, the one who is making the movie? Right. Could you tell him that Dr. Bennett said to see him St. Matthew's Hospital, Emergency Room, right away? I think that parents who misbuse their children are mentally all screwed up They need professional help. They are sick. I take the children from them. Lock them up and throw away the key. Parents who misbuse their children, I castrate them. Sometimes a kid needs a kick in the ass. To get you on the right track. If that's child abuse, then I'm for it. Violence breeds violence. No one has the right to abuse a child. Parents have the primary responsibility. Children need direction and limits. They need discipline. It is not difficult to raise children. Some parents just lose their heads. But I can't believe that a mother or father they would set out to hurt their son. I believe that, in the structure of any institution, whether government, family or school, that there is a tendency for people in the position of power to abuse it. The bible teaches honor your father and your mother. It is a commandment. A strict father is a special bird, a test from God. An abusive parent often feels powerless. On the job, in life, in society. I read in 'The Inquire' about this couple, They beat that girl to death. They broke her back and they said it was an accident. I think they were nuts. The only way to begin with to solve the abuse problem is to make Child Right a reality, and not just call parents names. Alright... let's go around once and get some initial quick responses to the sequence. After that, Larry will react to your reactions. David, let's begin with you. Stereotypes, that's all I see. Every one of them says, exactly what you expect them to say. The common man, the priest, that young black woman with the baby. Well, that's what I really liked about it. They may seem stereotypes, but there are people who, who think and talk that way in real life. I mean, these people were just stating their honest feelings about how they feel about child abuse and Didn't you sensed any of that? I'm sorry, true Christians don't feel that way in real life. Larry has made a plunderer of religion in his movie. The Bible teaches love and does not include the abuse of violence. Aaron... Imagine what Jesus said... - Aaron... "Let the children come to me..." I think you guys are taking it way out of context here. Aaron... May the Force be with you! I think Larry is trying to make a point in this film. I mean, he's trying to show a wide range of people and I agree with you, Sarah. I really felt these people. I felt they were real. I see them on the streets every day. If you think that's too typical, forget it. I really found it effective and would rated it four stars. Thank you Amy for the TV Guide score. Anytime, big guy. Okay, Larry, you've heard the jury, now it's your turn. Okay. The only thing that really counts for... Excuse me Professor, urgent message for Larry Porter... The only thing that really counts for me is whether the scene works. Thank you. Does it move you, does it make you think, feel, laugh, cry, get mad or fall asleep? David... It doesn't matter, if you've seen it before with Charlie Chaplin or in 'Los Ángeles de Charlie'. In the cinema everything is a cliché until it works again. Elaine, there are six men and six women in this scene. Mark... If I found seven black Jewish transsexual dwarfs with Italian accent wearing only mascara, and they have something interesting to say about child abuse, I film it. And if God did not like it, Aaron, He or She could love it. Oh you have a good heart Sarah and thanks you for the car, Amy. I got a dash, professor. Of course Larry. I hope it's not something serious. Allright. Next we will watch the uncut interview of the child abuse counselor, Kathy Logan. And then Larry edited that scene. When was he admittted? Two hours ago. Who brought him in? His parents. How bad? This kid has been through a little bit. You're going to report it? No. Larry... I have got eight months to go on my internship, which I don' t intent to fuckup with a lawsuit. So why the call? I mean, it's against the rules for me to be here. When I saw this kid, I just thought of your project. Yes, there he is. His name is Thomas Carroll. The kid is 14. He lives up at the Upper West Side on the nineteens.. Now... Check this out. This kid's arm has been broken. It's healed, but no doctor set it. The parents? There's no way to tell. It could have happened while he was playing and they didn't even notice it. What's this one? That's my friend is the other arm. Well, they are almost identical. The same place and the same break. Now, two accidents, two coincidences, but still not enough proof. What do you think? I think it would be great for the film. If only I could get to him. Mmmm... here is his statistics. The parents gave me their statement. Listen to this. Tommy had just a convulsion, like he was trying to threw up. Out of nowhere... He was having trouble catching his breath. We wrapped him in a blanket and we brought him up to the hospital. Goes on like that. You see where that's end? He is okay now, but... He might howl for a little while. Well, when I brought up, the parents probably went too far. They got hysterical and He freaked out for a minute. Like I said, I had a funny feeling about your project and figured... It would be better to come over. When do he gets out? Tomorrow. Tomorrow? Larry, I can't keep him here without a real reason. And they were even reluctant to leave him here overnight. They pick him up tomorrow and on Monday he will go back to school. No questions asked... It is as if nothing happened. Okay... Hit the showers. On the double. Everybody! That includes you, Carol. You heard me? You skipped bathing for the last time. I am not pulling up with anymore excuses. Hit the shower with the rest, or I sending you off to the Dean's office. Please sit down Thomas. Mr. Sirmac told me you don't want shower after gym class. Why not? Your P.E.-grade is high, so, why this sudden fear of soap and water? This is not like you, Thomas. What is the matter? Look, I'm going to have to write a note your parents and send you home early. These student critics... Not bad They liked the interview with the Logan girl. I'm gonna need them back by Monday, with written comments. Larry... You accepted this scholarship with your eyes open. I mean you're not getting a free apartment, and film, equipment and a master's degree for nothing. And remember, that at the end of the semester, if these six students, with their politics, their rhetoric and their religion. They gonna vote 'yes' or 'no' on your film. And if it's ' no'... Your degree has to go before a Faculty Commmittee for approval. So just play the game you agreed to play. Okay? What happened at the hospital Was it serious? Very! I think I found the star for my film. The star? When I began this project, I knew my film was not going to be like the other movies about child abuse you know? Interviews with concerned professionals, reformed parents, confessing all their crimes. Kids telling horror stories of the past... It has all been done before. But no one, no one has ever made a movie with a kid who is currently being abused. A child getting kicked around while the film was actually being made. And no one can't. The filmmaker would be liable. Legal action and possibly arrested, depending on the parents. Besides... it's unethical. Unethical? Larry... This film is being made under my office. If you know that a child is being abused, you are morally bound to report the parents and to help the child. Says you! But knowing about abuse and proving it in the courtroom are worlds apart. Allright... Think of the moral question. How would you find such a child? A star? A hospital don't let you cast your film from a pool of victimized children. In a way, that has happened. But I have to figure out how to meet him. Okay... Hit the showers. On the double! Everybody! That includes you, Carol. You skipped bathing for the last time. Sit down Thomas. Mr. Sirmac says you won't take a shower after gym class. Why not? What is the matter? Look, I'm gonna to have to write a note your parents and send you home early. Hi, this is Larry Porter. I'm making a motion picture about child abuse at the Horton School of Social Research. If you have a story about child abuse or information on the subject, and would like to contribute in some way to my film, wait for the peep and then leave your name, and telephone number and message. You have up to 3 minutes to tape if you want. Thank you. Hi. This is Thomas Carroll. We saw each other at the hospital the other night. Remember? I'd like to meet you. You can't call me here so I won't leave you this number. But uh.. I'll be down by the entrance of Riverside Park, by the tunnel. Sunday morning. Nine o'clock. If you can't If you can't make it this Sunday, I'll be there next Sunday too. Thomas. Why are you doing home from school so early? Look at this room! It is a mess! Thomas. Did you clean up today? No... but... Don't answer your mother with that tone of voice. Sit down and clean it up. Now! All over there are books on the floor. Your dress is a mess. Comic books. Your clothes are all over the bed. Your are sacrifice. I do not know what! And I do not know who you expect to clean your bathroom all the time. I suppose I'm supposed the one to do it? Thomas... I thought another one was supposed to clean your room all the time. You know enough to know if you're supposed to pick these up books and your shoes that are all over the place. The closet is a mess. Your bed is a mess with clothes all over. We've been through this a hundred times, Thomas. Your books and papers are sloppy. You didn't make your bed either. And don't forget to pick up your socks over there. You are a man, not a pig. Stop crying. Be a man. You're going to be in real trouble! Please, dad! You're going to have problems all the time... We talked about how you hurt your dad. So shut up! Shut up! Three minute limit. It was terrible. It made me crazy. How did he get your number? What are you going to do with this tape? Sending it to the cops? I want to use it in the film somehow. Why don't you do a nice anti-war film? Or a film about a dog which seems to starspankling banging baned. Or even a film about shopping ladies? Oh, come on Laura! I've edited pretty strange stuff for this project. My daughter was eight months old. I couldn't stand it when she touched me. Whenever she stepped down at me, I would tell her... Stop touch me! Leave me alone! So... I had grabbed her hands to make her stop. I hit her... over... and over again. I saw they were limp and bleeding. That's why I took her to the doctor. The Muppets movie is not. Pretty bizarre...! But this tape takes the cake. Can you get in trouble for using it? I don't know. Let's see how. No way to make an identification. The quality is not good enough. Yeah I know. The telephone sound makes it even creepier. What about Sunday? I'm gonna go. Sorry I am late.. That is okay. Eight new subscribers. I deliver paper? Well, I'm glad you came. I thought you weren't show up. Ooohh... I heard the message. I had to come. And my telephone phone number? Your T-shirt. And when the tape ran out... What happened? It was risky. Are you playing gum control every Sunday? Yes, for my deliveries. Too early for me. I had to rush like hell to get here. I did not eat. And I'm hungry. Me too. Coffee shop? At my place? Could you tell me about your film? Sure! I was trying to figure out how to meet you when I got your message on my machine. Do you like the omelette? My dad taught me to cook. He was in the Navy. I was a military brat. Born in Hawaii Raised in south. In and out of schools. My mom died when I was thirteen. Then I went to college at that University in Dallas. That's where I met Bennett. Oh! Bennett. He's the intern who saw you at the hospital. He is a good friend. After school, I went travelling. Hitchhiking. Search myself or something. Yeah, I went back to a lot of the places I passed through as a kid. Checked them out. They looked small. You want some more? Sure? Cause I do. How about a beer? I do not drink. Oh, hey! Beer doesn't count! When you first get in movies? Well... I was living in San Francisco, with this guy who made TV commercials. I was working as a model. By day and waiter by night. Anyway, it was his birthday. So I decided to give him a film. As a friend, you know? So I borrowed a super 8 camera and shot it. Well... the film was the hit of the party. Yeah... and I was hooked. Film fever! Then I started watching two or three movies a day. And I decided that New York was the place to learn film. So I came here... and enrolled in the Horton School, took a few courses and then I wrote up a prime project proposal for my film. Uh... there's a copy of it over there on the table. Well... They only liked my idea about child abuse. Especially Professor Rappaport. So I got my scholarship, which includes this place. Oh, keep it, it's yours. I got lots of it. Larry... Thomas? Are you gay? Queer... Yes. How about you? Yeah. Good. Now I think if you are going to start drinking beer seriously. I mean you should break in with Miller or Heineken. You know... They're light and... they are available at any store. Get a check! Could you tell? How is it? It's okay. Tell. How I look? You look fine. I could not tell that tutor I saw the pictures. Oh... yeah. This apartment is dead give-away. Is that you as a model? I was very hot. And vulnerable. What is vulnerable? Sensitive, tender, capable of being hurt, like you. In your movie, um What are you gonna ask the people? Well, I just let them talk at first. I like to get their POV. POV? What's that? Movie talk for 'Point of View'. You now... What is abuse like from your point POV? You want tape it? If you don't mind... But before I tell you, you have to know, believe that I love my mother and my father. I mean they are good to me most of the time, not just on Christmas or my birthday. But every day in lot of ways. And I don't always like what they do to me, and to each other. But I know that they love me. Right? Okay. It always starts with an argument. A fight over something. Me, the money or the house. Any stupid. And I begin to get ready inside. Cause I can feel it coming. In the kitchen, in my room, or in the living room watching television. Doing my homework. I can tell it is close by the sound of their voices. Thomas! Do you want some popcorn? Look at your father when he talks to you, Tommy. No, sir. I ate enough for dinner. Here... it's good, have some. Your mother made it. Sure dad. Don't spill it. Are you spastic? I'm sorry. How is it, Tommy? Good. What's that you're writing there? My homework, dad. How many times I have told you do you do homework in your room? TV is only after it's done. Where you going? To my room. I'll finish there. You know the homework rules, Tommy. Why don't you go to bed? I'm sorry. I forgot. We have to study hard, When you're the last in your class. Lately I have been loosing it. It is hard to explain. Slaps are bad. Thomas... Stop it! I had taken worse. Come here Tommy! I'm going to count to ten. And if you're not here by then, You gonna wish you were never been born. How they look... Honey... Why are you so stubborn? The weird act. That's what scares me. I mean... It wants me want to break out and run. And it's so dumm. It is if there is no any place to go to hide or to run to. What makes the matter. Three! That's better, Thomas. Four! If you just learn to do what's you been told. Five! Some respect. Six! I saw you wanna smile... Seven! Eight! You got to learn to listen. Nine! Stop acting like a baby! Ten! Never again! Never! Do you hear me? Happy Birthday. Happy Birthday. Happy Birthday. Happy Birthday. Happy Birthday. Happy Birthday. Merry Christmas, son. Merry Christmas. How long has this been going on? Six years. I wanna go home now. Yes, but it's only... I want go home now. Sure. Next Sunday? Sure. You'll be there? Sure. Hey! Hold it! Open wide. The 'Trident' treatment. Cover the beer on your breath. And don't forget your folder. Right. Good night, son. Talk to me. The camera, the light, for as your concern. You're not even here. How... how loud should I talk? Just talk naturally. The mike will pick up. Just tell me, like last week. Suppose I'm making mistakes or I forget... Don't worry about that. It's your story. You're sure? If you forget or go blank... We'll cut it out later. Okay. Uh... Just tell when it's running. It has been on for half a minute. Larry! Don't worry. And you look just fine. Now, tell me what you remember about the first time. The first time they... The first time you were abused... How it was. How you felt. Okay. The first time. HOUSEWIFE ITCHES HER DAUGHTER'S HAND FOR STEALING A CENT. It that for real? The headline is a bit extreme, but the story is true. Here. Try this one. Read the capture. FATHER FRIES HIS SON IN THE PAN. Out loud! Willy Thatcher, thirty-seven, Cleveland Ohio, real estate broker, in his arrainments... for he skill him, slaughter of his six-month-old son, Philip... "He cried and screamed all night," explained Thatcher, Until I was going crazy. So I picked him up and took him up to the kitchen and Oh, God! Take the shot. Just press the button on the front of the camera. Uh... thanks a lot for the help. I usually do this alone. I thought you didn't like to play dawn patrol. Well, for myself, I had much rather sleep late. But this is for the movie. What are you going film up here? Abuse. Down there... Take a look. Hold this lever here, it is on a free lock. Now you can pan around. What? It's a crime. Forget it. Take your shot. Push the button on the front. That's it. How do you know what is going to happen? I don't. I sit up here and watch. All day? All day... You got some great shots. Thanks. Talk to me. The camera, the light, for as your concern. You are not even here. I look weird. How... how loud should I talk? I sound weird. First time. You get it. You are not used hearing your scene. Suppose I'm making mistakes or I forget... Don't worry about that. It's your story You're sure? A mistake, we'll cut it out later. The camera is running. Wise guy.. Larry! Don't worry! I was very nervous. And you look just fine. Now, tell me what you remember about the first time. The first time they... The first time you were abused... How it was. How you felt? Okay The first time. Well... except for Laura, my editor, no one has seen much of the film before. What do you think? Right. But don't you think of anything else besides the movie? Not much else these days. What about him and him? Tim and Richard? Well, that's Tim. Farmboy. Great guy. Real redneck. A lot of fun. We met in Austin, got our own place. Year and a half together. I was happy. We were very young. His family stepped in. They had well-to do And Tim... Well, he couldn't let them down. Found himself a girl. Got married Two children so far. He is okay. And Richard? Ah... Richard! Richard and I met in San Francisco, about three years ago. It was ' love at first fight'. He is in New York now. He is a singer-composer. He is playing piano in a club, on the East Side, with his new lover, Frankie. The two and I were so different. It was one continuing boxing match for two years. We... we hung up the gloves a while back. Movies and my scholarship helped me getting over him. More or less... How about you? Lots the same. School, movies and home And I practice guitar and some music. Is the same. Except for Joey Brooks. I was in my English class. Joey... Well, we used to go to his house almost every day after school. His parents worked until five. He was... uh... hot! And vulnerable. And uh... then last June You know. His father got his job.. Switched to Los Angeles, and... No more Joey Brooks. A few letters at first, but... I never know when my parents are going to open my mail. I told Joey not to go on. They would freak out if they found out. Easy, mate, easy. You gotta to go home soon. And that 'Trident treatment' doesn't cover so much, you know. What's next in the film? Aaahhh... music... for the soundtrack. How was the level? Sounds fine in here, Samantha, Remember. Take your time. The longer the line, the better. Okay, Larry/ Three verses? Right. All right. Whenever you're ready. Sometimes I feel like a motherless child. Sometimes I feel like a motherless child. Sometimes I feel like a motherless child. A long way From home. A long way From home. Sometimes I feel I'm alone in the dark. Sometimes I feel I'm alone in the dark. Sometimes I feel I' m alone in the dark. Very A long way From home. A long way From home. When I was nine, my father started coming into my bedroom. He takes my pajamas off... enter me, and pound me until he climaxed. Then he takes me to the bathroom and wash me off. That was my mother. She.. uhhh... Tied me up, Laid me in the closet, overnight. Sometimes for a whole day, In the dark. No food or water. I then.. I end up... pissing all over my clothes and myself. I hear her come back in, and she takes me out, hug me and give me dinner. My dad would take me in the basement, and he used to beat me... with a belt... and a wooden clothhanger. Until I started to bleed and I have the scars... There is a time I couldn't even sitdown or walk. Last year in America, four thousands children died, for parental abuse. Four thousand children killed. Two hundred thousand reported beatings, and sixty-five thousands sexual assaults. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. There are thousands of incidents that get never reported. The worst thing they did to me, have been the cigarette burn. On my chest and on my aisle. I... I get in trouble at school, cause why don't I shower after gym class? Anyone who is asking what those marks are? How I got them. Even when the kids are scarred, they loyally swear that they love their abusive parents. And those parents say that they love their abused kids. Love is part of the abuse fact. The first time I remember my mother held me down. She was stoned. My father kneel over me and unbutton my shirt. His eyes... are crazy. Took a drag of a cigarette, then brought it down upon my chest my chest and burned me. I scream and he slap me. She put her hand on my mouth, and... he burned me again... and again. I close my eyes tight. I can never look at them. But even with my eyes shut, I can still tell this before he is going burn me. My mother holds my arm next to her heart before he does. Abuse is not just a moment rage or an angry outburst. It's a life-pattern. Where the parent is violent one minute, and supportive the next. I wake up, and he is putting... vaseline or band-aid or something. The kid learns to take the pain, to get to the pleasure. The night I got burned, I sleep between my mother and father in their bed, In their room. Abuse and love become blurred. Two sides of the same coin. How long this has been going on? Been six years. The crisis comes when the children think that they are getting into the punishment to be closer to the parent. I curled up next to my mom trying going to sleep. And when the realization dawns, it hits him. Making abused kids hate themselves, for becoming a real part of the cycle of abuse. Accomplises to their own victimization. I feel like I've done something wrong... bad... I guess I am bringing it on sometimes myself. But they are my parents and I love them. And I don't know what makes them do it. I guess... It is because I have never been able to be what, they want me to be. To do what they want me to do. I had to please them, I don't wanna to talk anymore, Larry. I feel insane. Would you mind telling us about the scars on your chest? Remember... The father that raped his daughter on Friday night, will probably set coffee for dinner and say: 'More dessert darling?' Well, is she alright? Oh Lord! That's terrible. Hi, I'm Larry Porter. I'm making a motion picture about child abuse at the Horton School of Social Research. If you have a story about abuse or information on the subject, and would like to contribute in some way to my film, wait for the peep and then leave your name, and telephone number and message. You have up to three minutes to tape it. Thank you. Hi Larry. It's Thomas. Uh... hoped I like the film. I wish I could have been there. I finished my homework for the weekend. Who are you talking to? Okay... On monday? Great! Okay... Thanks! Um, just a friend from school. I wonder check out about a competition. Tommy... Is it not a little late for be talking to a man on the telephone? Uh ...yeah, sorry. I just wanted to make sure. OK. - Well. You better go to bed before your dad finds out. Okay. Give me a hug. I love you. Hi... It's Richard. Showtime today at nine at midnight. I come here in the club and I finished the song for your new film and I think you gonna like it. Then see you later. Bye bye! Hi Larry... It's Thomas. Hoped you liked film. I wish I could have been there. I finished my homework for the weekend. Who are you talking to? Okay... On Monday? Great! Okay! Thanks! Larry... It's Professor Rappaport. Just a reminder to confirm our meeting tomorrow. At twelve noon in my office. And Larry... bring your copy of the scholarship award letter with you. Larry... How did you know that at the end of the semester your film has to be shown publicly. Not Broadway, but at least in the School Auditorium, for Faculty students, guests, etc. Now I am not in favor of any form of censorship. And my stomach is a little stronger than Sarah's. So I only have one question for you. Did you like the scene? I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like it. Is it a 'Yes' or a 'No'? Larry... I don't think it matters if I liked it or not. Does to me. I liked it. And I like you. But do you have permission from the boy's parents to use him in the film? No... How could I? Larry... That boy is a legal time bomb. Now, I grant you the right to have him explode him in your face, if you so tute. But not mine. What he is? Fifteen? Fourteen. Larry... There are several ways to handle this. The simpliest means to cut the boy out of the picture. Find another child and... Alright. Paint a little black square over his eyes, frame by frame. Anything but what you're doing. It's unethical, it's dangerous, and it is truly abusive to the boy. What are you doing for brunch tomorrow? What? Have brunch tomorrow with me and the boy. Larry... We meet every Sunday. Look... Have you ever met an abused child? He is a great kid. Oh just for once, step out of your home world. Okay? Where... What time? Come on, Thomas. You look just great. Really knappy. And the jacket almost fits. Oh, come on, Thomas. Don't you worry about anything. Everything is going to work out just fine. And you're like Professor Rappaport. He is a great guy. Really... Come on! Well, Larry. What do you suggest? A brunch would be wonderful. Brunch with an apertising? I think the house-taste is very good. What you going to have, Thomas? What about the...? Benedict A good choice. Oh yeah... I heard they are very tasty. Have uuhh... you seen the film yet, Thomas? Some parts. We only learn Larry show you. So far, it is very unusual. Oh sure, anytime time, sure! Where is that waiter? You uhhh... You like it? Oh yeah... It's uhhh... It's very unusual. You know, Larry? I particulary liked how you used that source, that spiritual, with the pictures of those children. Oh well... It's an old trick. I wanna thank you. Especially the playground-sounds are very pointed. Very well done by you. And that singer's voice is very rich. Oh, I've known Samantha for years. She is a natural. I knew I could put all those scenes together. You know that Pearson was all about. You know... the simple use of a device like those stills, can counterevolve all sort of... Thomas... what are you doing? All sorts of uh... feelings and associations. And with the right soundtrack. Stop it, Thomas. Thomas, please. Uh... perhaps... Thomas is upset. We might have a brunch another time. Thomas... stop! Stop it, Thomas! Larry... take it easy. Take it easy, Larry. It's just a punk. If that is all, I bet it's still sitting there. Many times, chad. I don't know, did I say that? When did you know? At the hospital. At the hospital? Are you kidding? Well, I think I answered your T-shirt. I thought you were interested in my film. I am. Now, but... then... I don't know. I just looked into your eyes and... When did you know? This morning. Getting ready. I was nervous. I didn't wanna admit it. And then, at brunch... I felt naked. The crap of what he might tell... Just looking at the ass. Hey... what's next in the film? Oh... we're done. Except one sigh. It's okay Thomas. Put the mike on. Are we both going to be seen in the shot at the same time? Just hold this placeboard up. Yes, a little bit higher. That's a good height... Perfect. Alright, now just hold it. Okay. It is rolling on the both of us. I get it. Okay You're ready? Anytime, chap. Last shot. Take 1. And Hitchcock's workform creates it... All of Hitchcock can be summed up in this formula. Brad and Chuck, lingered in the showerroom long after their teammates went to the lockers. Brad levelled up. And Chuck reached for this slippery bar of soap. Chuck turned his bench straighten up to its full height. He smiled. Chuck watched the hotsoap, go down his muscular chest, arms and legs. Chuck held his breath. No sounds from the locker room. The team was gone. Only Brad's laughter echoed. Brad reached over, to Chuck's slobby and foxy... You scared! This is a great gimmick. A public selling by private invitation only. Rappaport must have been beaten this up. Yeah... It got him off the hook. Invitations only the people who cannot cause trouble. He had never missed a Sunday before? Never! Maybe he called. No call on my answering machine. Well... Anything could have been happened. Like what? Mr. and Mrs. Macbeth have decided to have a family out. Make a day out... church, lunch at McDonald's. And a show at Radio City. That does not feel right. Why don't you call him? No way. You don't have to tell them who you are. Say it's from school. No, if I call him, they will kill him. No calling at home. I call them. I'll tell them I'm his girlfriend. They will never get the scene for that. Thanks Laura. It's a very good idea. Everything inside says not to call. Well... everything gonna be fine. Why don't you go out and have a few drinks? Go to Richard's club. You know... Music has charm. And I bet by the time you get home there will be a message. Or maybe we'll catch the call. Okay... You're probably right. By my side. By my side. I love over you by my side. By my side. Thank you! Thank you. That was one of Frankie's early works. Too early. I see we have a number of well-known personalities in our audience tonight, including a big time film director, from the south of the coast, working on his latest film. So here's my lastest song, commissioned by that director, for that film. I think something's wrong. I think he is in trouble. Let me tell you something. I need your help. Dude, starting me feeling sick. And I helped you... I thought you were serious about getting your degree man! Your film. I am. A film about child abuse, Larry! Sounds like you use children yourself. It sounds like some... some tv-testing for production, man! Dr. Bill, you've been called four or five times... You know... I called you! I trusted you. You know. If the parents ever get any wind of this matter., If they find out. They'll be after your ass, man! That is child molestation. The police! You're a piece of cake for jail. Listen to me, man! It's not my ass that I am worried about. Can't you call the other emergency room for me? Maybe they have admitted him somewhere else. No, no, no.. Larry! He did not show up. He broke the date. That's it! Every kid wides up. Tim... No matter what you think of me... There is.. I think you're exploiting that kid. That is what I think. I think you dragged him into your own homosexual fantasy world, man. And I am responsible! Okay... So I am the 'Boston Strangler'. But look, I got this feeling in the pit of my stomach This kid is in trouble. Can't you call his house? What I gotta say? Man, I can't call the father. Call him up and say: "Hello, Mr. Carroll. This is the doctor friend of your son's lover. Is Thomas okay or have you beat the shit out of him again?" Come on! Just give me a break, man! You know better than that... That are our asses, man! So close to your degree! And my internship? Tim... Maybe this time... has gone too far. You set me up. Larry... I'm way over my break. Call me, alright? Let me know what happens. We are both in on this. No matter. Let me know. Larry Porter? Yes... Some questions. About what? Please! You were friends, weren't you? I knew. I know him. What happened? Hi... This Larry Porter. I'm making a movie picture about child abuse at the Horton School of Social Research. If you have a story about abuse the information... Thomas is that you? They would not let me out today. Not even to deliver my papers. A bad... last night. What did they do to you? Larry, don't talk like that. There is nothing you can do. Yeah... I am scared. No... There was fighting nothing out of no place. Then tonight, they wanted pizza. Too late for delivery. So I volunteered. Look Larry... I gottal go. I'm going home every day after school this week. See if that helps. I'll... I'll see you on Sunday. Yeah... Sunday. Listen, call when you get the chance, he. And be careful! Okay. Bye! Last year in America... 4,000 children died from mistreatment by their parents. 4,000 children killed. 200,000 reported beatings, and 65,000 sexual assaults. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. There are thousands of incidents that never get reported. We are all taught that children are innocent little angels. But angels are not people and the kids are. Human beings with real needs and desires, like their parents. With weaknesses and breaking points. Look, why do some abused children run away? And others don't? Why some ask for help? And others keep quiet? Keeping the big family secret... Look... Why do some abused children run away? Why do some abused children run away? Run away.. Hi... This is Larry Porter. Can I speak to Kathy Logan, please? Kathy Logan... Can I help you? Hi Kathy. This is Larry Porter. Remember the film? Of course Larry! What can I do for you? Something about the film? A sort of... Can I see you this afternoon? Do you get some time? How about one o'clock? Kidnapping? Well after the last episode, I thought... Going away with him would be the best thing to do. And what is his opinion on this get away plan? I haven't told him yet. You know... you really are something... You come here... with this fairy tale about a boy in trouble. Slowly becoming his friend... And then just a wandering into his pants? Have you met his parents? No. And how do you know he has not invented all of this? The marks on his body. Suppose he did it himself. His arms... the X-rays. Rush hour crowd... I don't know, but neither do you for sure. Why would he invented it all? Look... Larry. I was an abused kid. I spent four years in a shelter like this one. That's why I got this job. Beause I'm harder to con than your average well-being bleeding heart. Abused kids are kids.. They exaggerate... They stretch the truth. They tell stories to get love and attention. If some prince charming had come along when I was fourten... I would have told him anything to play Snow White. But you've got the traveler's checks and the tickets and you are stubborn enough to take the child and run. So why did you come here? It's what you said in the film. You ask... Why do some kids run away? Why do some stay? Why some reach out for help? And others... I remember that vaguely, so... I came here because... You know about this abuse game. I'm asking for the odds on Thomas and me. Hundred to one against. Let's get some coffee. Larry... Every kid in this shelter has been abused for years. A little understanding, a little tender loving care won't make it all there. That is why so many batted kids grow up and bat their own children. Okay. You're thinking that Thomas is different. They are different. This is the boys' dorm. This is Michael's bed and that is Robert's bed. He is fifteen. His father used to rape him. Laying him at the bedroom and rape him. It went on for three years until finally Robert told the teacher who had the guts to see what could be done about it. What happened? Robert got sent here by the Court. His father agreed to do group therapy at a City clinic which kept the rest of the family together. No welfare, no institutionalization of Robert's... So how is he now? Robert is waiting, Like most kids here. Waiting for a job, or... Maybe another foster family placement. Although the first one was a wash-up. A middle-aged couple from Long Island, with four grown children of their own, took Robert on trial. In less than six months he was back here. The foster father has started to loose his temper. He even beaten Robert badly once, before he realized he was out of this head. After some talks, it became clear that the abusive pattern that Robert had learned in his own home, was being re-enacted in the foster house. And even you know, he screamed and warned, the foster parents were no match for Robert's manipulations. But what made Robert finally decide to tell about his father? There's no way to know. Whatever it was, it had to come from Robert. You say that you care for Thomas. So... Alright, I believe you. Big deal. That's hardly a beginning. You just can't reach in and click a kid on. I love you. You are transformed. That moment... If it comes for Thomas... can only come from Thomas himself. And then, there is a chance. With love, time and luck. He might change. What made you finally decide to get out, Kathy? What was your moment? My dad... he got me pregnant. Well... I almost did it. I almost... almost had the nerve to split with a kid. You know... I know that you thought it was wrong from the top. That I shouldn't even have thought of taking the kid away. Is that right? Well, look at all the problems... where would you gone? How would you have managed? Suppose it hadn't worked out. Anyway... How are you going to get to be a big time director, and take along a certain dynamic film editor, An editor who is beyond love. I mean, if you way out somewhere far away... being chased by the cops and the FBI... And then there's the movie... I wasn't thinking of the film. Well you should think of it. That is the best thing I've worked on. Since I've been at Horton School... So dorry. I mean, that's for sure for your degree. I mean, even if not all students are happy. And besides... each Sunday Thomas gets a coffee. Oh, I love sweet endings. The answer to child abuse is a very tuff question. I only speak for myself and say... therapy, family therapy. Education. Love and understanding. Top the laws. They protect the kids.. I think that all people should report, any child abuse they know about. More real services, counseling centers and the money to back them up. Respect their rights. Fight back. Tell the police or someone at school. I was too ashamed to get help. I should have told someone sooner. I don't keep a secret. I don't hold it in. Get out as soon as you can. Run away, if you have. I... I waited too long. There is no one answer. I am for more child legal aid services More counselors... More people getting out there to help folks and parents. But right now there are parents, abusing their kids, their kids taking that mix to be the abusers of the future. Parents do not own a child. They give life but it does not belong to them. The child belongs to the child. Thomas... I need some more question please. What do you think is the answer to child abuse? I don't know. I don't know If you saw my point of view... I understand your point of view. Okay. You're the one who... I'm sorry I don't have a college degree to understand you... You're the one who was raising how about dinner. I overlooked at it. Okay, okay. I'll question it. I know, maybe I'm making a fuzz about it. But I only think if the question is asked. Who is more responsible, for the difficulty or his tardiness? Do you see what I'm saying? You are his mother, aren't you? Well, I guess of course... It's your son, isn't it? Yes, he is my son, but he is your son too. And I think it's up to you to find out, Where he has been on a Sunday evening? He knows the rules about the homework and about restorance and about getting ready for Monday, It cannot be organized only to-morrow. Thomas... Thomas... Come in here! Thomas, you're late again. Where have you been? Thomas, aren't you going to tell us why you're late? Answer your mother when she asks you a question. Don't you have any respect for your mother or for me? Can you hear me? Yeah? We can't hear you. Yes, dad... I can't! Larry! Laura... would you mind telephone Larry? It's getting very late. Clear. Ladies and Gentlemen. I am sorry for the delay. Film is here, but the filmmaker is late. It's allow time for questions afterwards... We may have to begin without him. I'm sorry... The number you have called, 932-4678 has been disconnected. 932-4678 has been disconnected. If you require further attention, stay on the line and an operator will help you. Neither I, nor the six student evaluating students, has seen Larry's film. And tonight... Well, I'm sure that Larry will be here, before the screen is over. So... Lights please. And let's begin. Okay... You're ready? Anytime, chap. Last shot. Take 1. The film you are about to see it's not really mine. It has my name on it and with any luck, I'll get a master's degree for it. But the truth is my movie really belongs to him. It's his story. And he risked a lot in telling me... To me and now to you. Thanks Thomas.
