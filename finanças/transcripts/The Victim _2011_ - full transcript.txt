- ( Woman gasping ) - ( man moaning, panting) Man: Yeah, right there. Give it to me. Come on. Give it to me. Do it. That's it. That's it. That's it. Yes! Come on. (grunting ) Oh, God. Oh, yeah. That's it. You like that, don't you? ( Groans ) ( belt jangling ) Oh, God. Oh, yeah. Oh, you like that, don't you? Right there. - That's how you like it, huh? - Yeah. You're a dirty little thing, aren't you? ( gasps ) Oh, you like it hard and you like it anywhere. - Oh, yeah. - Mm. I'll give it to you. I'll give it to you all fucking day. Oh, yeah. Yeah, you like that, huh? Dirty girl. Tell me you like it. - You like that, huh? - Oh, yeah. - You like that, don't you? - Yeah. Just like that. - Oh, that's good, huh? - Yeah. - You like it hard, don't you? - Yeah. That's right where you want it, isn't it? Look me in the eye. - Tell me you're a whore. - Uh-huh. I'm a whore. - That's right. Tell me you're a whore. - I'm a whore. Look at me and tell me you're a whore. Look at me. Come on. Look at me. And tell me you're a whore. - Would you just come already? - What did you say? ( Sharp snap ) Miss? Oh, great. And I'll be right back with your change. You can keep it. Thank you very much. - Have a good day. - I always do. ( Music playing ) ( panting ) (crying ) Woman's voice: What if all your problems... ( gasps ) are just memories? If you really look, there are no problems in this actual moment. The mind's tendency is to look for a problem when they are not actually here. If you look right now into this moment, you will see the couch, the living room, the screen on which I appear. ( Continues crying ) ( heart beating ) Listen to this. Consider the significance and never forget that only love is-- You may now pause this video and review the concepts of chapters one and two. And then you may proceed to chapter three. (clicks mouse) ( gasping, crying ) ( screams ) Help me somebody, please! Please! Please help me! Somebody, please! Help me! Please! Please let me in. Please! Open the door! Please! Help me! Help me! Please! They already got my friend! Please, somebody help me. Somebody help me. Please, please, please let me in! Please! Please, they're almost here! Please. Please. Please let me in! Help. Help. ( Door rattling ) Please, please, please open the door! (crying ) Please. They're chasing me. Please help me. Please help me. Please, they're after me. Who's chasing you? Who's after you? ( Crying ) Please let me in. Please. Who's almost here? - Who's chasing you? - Please. Please, they killed my friend. - All right. - Oh, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. ( Sobbing ) Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Calm down. Calm down. What's the matter with you? Tell me what's going on. - What? - I don't know what the problem is. - Do you need a doctor? - No! They're trying to kill me! ( Crickets chirping ) Now, tell me, who's after you? (whispering ) They killed her. - Your friend? - Oh, God. Mary. Mary? Mary was your friend? - Who killed her? - We never should've gone. (crying ) Calm down. Tell me your name. What's your name? Annie. Annie. Good. Good, now. Tell me who's after you and who killed Mary. The police. - What'd ya do? - Nothing. - Don't lie to me. - I'm not. It's not what you think. Then what is it? Mary was seeing one of them. They were- they were just hanging out. ( Music playing on radio) J' When I was five years old... J' Come on. Let me see it. No. Please? I don't just show it to anyone. If you show it to me, I promise I won't tell. J' The girls would laugh and smile J' J' After a while J' J' She'd come up, whup on my behind... J' Is that a Glock? - No, it's a Beretta. - Mmm. - Are you any good? - Yeah. Let's see. Can't fire it here. Please? Please? J' Your mom would holler and shout J' J' We would all hang out... J' ( laughs ) That's hot. I want to try. Okay. J' As a boozer and a loser... J' Oh, no. Okay, make sure that your sights - are all lined up. - Okay. Okay, the trick is to squeeze the trigger. Don't pull it. It'll kick back, but it won't hurt, so don't be afraid. (gunshots) Ha-ha! - I want one. - Heh. Knock that off. Oh shit. Sorry. Put it away. You're gonna get us in trouble. Don't worry. He is the law around here. You're looking at the next Williams County Sheriff. From your mouth to God's ears. J' Barely cost a dime... J' Thank you. J' But I sure did some hard time J' J' 30 days' house arrest J' J' At the old town bar J' J' Can't remember 20 too good J' J' Wouldn't want to if I could J' J' I got married, got divorced J' J' I might have married again... J' Hey. - What are you doing? - What? You'll take your clothes off for a roomful of strangers, and now you're getting all shy? J' I was born into this world J' J' With a reputation... J' - Not here, okay? - Okay. Lead the way. J' But you know I'd never give up J' J' These libations J' J' So shut up, drink up J' J' And let me get my kicks for free... J' Now what? Our turn. (grunting and panting ) You're really good with that gun. I'm good at everything that I do, Annie. Is that right? ( Music playing faintly ) - ( panting ) ( belt jangling ) ( inhales sharply ) ( moaning ) Cooger! - Get over here! - What? Now! I'm serious! Are you kidding me? Right now! All right, all right. Sorry, babe. What happened? She's dead. Jim, she's dead. I know she's dead, God damn it! What happened? We were just having fun. I got a little rough. She's just so little, I-- I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. What are we gonna do? We get rid of her. Wow. Um... how? We bury her. Right here. Right now. What about the other one? Go get her. Annie. I overheard them talking. He killed her. I know he did. How'd you getaway? I don't know. I just got outta there. Well, then you came to the wrong guy, 'cause I can't get mixed up with the law. Come on. What? We're leaving. What? Where? I'm gonna take you into town. No, I can't do that. I've got my own problems. So you can either come with me or take your chances in the woods. I'm all alone out here. Hide. - What? - Someone's coming. - Hide. - ( car door closes ) ( knocks ) Are you Kyle Limato? Yes. Good evening, sir. I'm Detective James Harrison. I'm with the Williams County Sheriff's Department. May I come inside? What can I do for you? We're looking for a woman. This woman. We think she may have retreated into the woods and may be trying to take shelter in one of the homes in the area. I haven't seen anyone. Who are you? I'm Detective Jonathan Cooger. You don't look like a cop. James: Then he's doing his job. He's an undercover narcotics agent. This is a joint investigation. Well, like I said, I haven't seen anyone. Can we come inside? No one's here. I didn't say anyone was. It's just that these woods, they're a-- well, they're a great place to hide. Yeah, I know they are. You seem nervous. You seem nervous, too. This young woman, she's wanted in connection with a homicide. Finding her would be a big help to our case. It might blow it wide open. Well, I don't know what I can tell ya. I haven't seen anyone. Fair enough. If you do see her, here's my card. Please give me a call. Anything for law enforcement. Hmm. To be honest with you, you look a little bit suspicious. I don't think you're alone in here. What? I said I was. Yeah. You did. You did. But I guess we can say just about anything we want to, can't we? I guess so. You have a wonderful evening. You too, Officer. (engine starts) That was them. - Who are you? - What do you mean? You heard 'em. They said you were a fugitive. He's a liar. They showed me your mug shot. I've been arrested. Once. - Once. - For what? Possession of marijuana. It was no big deal. They plea-bargained it. I ended up doing community service. Look, I am no angel. I'm a dancer in a nightclub. And I like to party and have a good time. And that's what we were doing with these cops when everything went crazy. But I know a lot of girls who've gotten themselves into all kinds of shit. And that's not me. Other than that one little fuck-up, I have never been in any serious trouble. I swear. I come all the way out here to getaway from people, to getaway from trouble, this crap lands on my doorstep. Listen... I think we should just go to somebody else in the sheriffs office. We can't do that. This guy's a bigshot. He runs the whole show. He can do whatever he wants and cover it up. I'm finding that hard to believe. It's true. Well, you're right about that. This guy's pretty heavy-duty What do you wanna do? We could get proof. What kinda proof? Mary I know where she's at. I can take you there and you could see I'm telling the truth. Once we find Mary, we can prove that he killed her. All we have to do is drive there. Please let me take you there. I'm begging you. Please. ( Car door opens ) (engine starts) ( music playing ) : Light : J' And day J' J' Raining J' J' Crimson brown J' J' Wasted... J' Is that your cabin? No. It's my uncle's, but he hasn't used it in years. Why not? Uh, he used to use it for hunting and fishing, but he's too old for that now. J' From the dark... J' So why do you live there alone? So far from everyone? Come on, you can tell me. I guess I just like being alone. Why? I don't know. It's, uh-- it's complicated. What do you mean? Why do you ask so many questions? J' Broken J' J' Spoken today J' J' With you I might... J' ( hip-hop music playing faintly ) So? What do ya think? Yeah, it's cute. What, you don't like it? No, it's totally sexy. It's just that Kim wears something similar on stage. ( Sighs ) I forgot. Oh, God. Poor Kim. I feel so bad for her. I know, the whole escort thing. Can you imagine? Have you met her boyfriend? ( laughing ) He's such a jerk. I know. Hang on. I'll try another one. And then cocktails. Tell me about the friend. What do you want to know? Just the essentials. Bad boy. He's a narc, so he's definitely gonna have some blow. What does he look like? He's kinda got that rugged Johnny Depp thing going on. Good enough. Well? - Now that's hot. - Really? - You don't think it's too girly? - No. I sorta wanna do you right now. You wish. So... are you coming or not? Don'! I always? That's why I love you. I love you, too. What if she's not there? Are you sure you're telling me the truth? Why don't you trust me? I didn't say I didn't. Take a left. On that dirt road. It should be on the right. J' Broken J' J' Spoken... J' Is this the place? J' With you, I J' J' Might break J' J' Away... J' Are you all right? I don't know if I can do this. You have to. We're here. What, are you gonna stay in the car? No. I'll come with you. This is where we were partying. (sighs) This is where she was. They moved her body. God damn it! They moved her body. That's Mary's. You believe me now? Yes. But what do you want me to do? I still say you should just find some other cops, talk to them. And say what? Tell them the truth. Do you think they'll believe me? Without her body, there is no crime! What are you yelling at me for?! I'm just trying to help! I don't even know how I got involved in this situation! God damn it! I'm sorry. Come on. Annie. Yeah? I've been thinking. There's other agencies we can go to: the FBI, the DEA. How old are you? What? - How old are you? - 54. You don't look 54. You look really good for 54. Really? Yeah. I don't know-- I've just, um, always had this thing for older men. What are you doing? Why? You don't like me? I didn't say that. I think you like me. You like me. J' I don't know why we don't know J' J' How to talk to one another anymore J' J' Well the-- the constant stream of J' J' He said, she said J' J' You know, it makes me wanna run J? J' For the door J' J' And she says "go" J' J' Well, the-- the time we have is right now J' J' That is my only concern J' J' Because when I am dead and gone J' J' You know it doesn't matter if it's you or me or him or her J' J' The only thing that I got are lessons learned J' J' And she says "go" J' J' Well, I don't care what you J' J' Have to say no more J' J' So then I say "go" J' J' No, I don't care if you run away anymore J' J' You and me J' J' All the things we fight for and never see J' J' Oh, no, in the light of day. J' - Are you okay? - Yeah. Not only do you look good for 54, - you fuck good for 54. - ( chuckles ) Not only do you look good for 54, - you fuck good for 54. - ( chuckles ) Where are you going? I'll be right back. ( Whispers ) That's romantic. ( Pop music playing ) I don't know why I keep going out with him. I know why. Aside from the coke, I don't know why I keep going out with him. He's always got money. So what's the problem? I don't know exactly. It's just-- he's just so straight. You know, with the church and the family and the barbecues and the blah, blah, blah, I-- I don't know, it's just weird. ( Phone vibrates) Hold on. - Oh, boy. - ( sighs ) Hi, baby. (mimics stuffy nose) Yeah, no, I'm just really not feeling good right now. Yeah, I think I'm coming down with a cold. Oh. You wanna do that to me? Oh, you better stop it right now. You're making me all hot. Okay. I'll call you when I'm feeling better, okay? Okay. Okay, bye. Ugh. Such a freak. What'd he say? Same shit he always says. I don't know. He's such a freak. Men are so weird. Kyle? Kyle? Kyle? - Hey, you. - ( muffled whimpering ) Relax, shh. I won't shoot. You need to relax. Still, shh shh shh shh shh shh. Be still. We're gonna wait right here until loverboy gets back. No. No, no, no, no, no. You don't wanna do that. You definitely don't wanna do that. This can be easy, or this can be hard. ( Muffled crying ) But you like it hard, don't you? Yeah. You like it a little rough. Turns you on, doesn't it? You're like Mary, aren't you? He slap you around a little bit, hmm? Did you let him? He's a big, strong man. I bet you didn't know what to do in the arms of all that man. I'm a big strong man, too. And I'm about to put your hero down. (yells) That hurt. Don't do that again. Didn't what happened to Mary teach you anything? She thought she was in control. She thought she was in charge. But nobody fucks with James Harrison. - ( Growls ) - ( cries out ) -( both grunting ) - ( objects clattering ) ( panting ) Is he dead? No. He was gonna kill us. Maybe. I say we kill the motherfucker. - Are you out of your mind? - He killed Mary! Nobody's killing anybody. You believe me now? (grunts) What's going on? It's funny. I was gonna ask you the same thing. What? What are you doing in my house? I told you. I was following up on a lead. - You have a warrant? - What? Do you have a warrant to be in my house? You need a warrant to be in my house. No. You're a police officer and you don't have a warrant. That means you're breaking the law. Am I right? Technically. - Okay, what are you doing here? - Working a case. - What kind of case? - Homicide. What's the name of the victim? Wha-. I don't.. You don't know the name of the victim of the homicide case you're working? - Rihanna. - Rihanna what? Hayes. Took you a long time to remember her name. If I was working a case, I think I would-- I would remember her name a lot quicker than that. Who found the body? Uh, she was a prostitute. We found her in a dumpster behind a sporting goods store on Fifth Ave. I didn't ask you where you found the body. I asked you who found the body. Why do you want to know about my case? I wanna know if you're telling the truth. Who found the body? Another streetwalker. Okay, the dead prostitute. What'd she look like? She have red hair? Brown hair? Blonde, what? Redhead, what? - She was African-American. - African-American. Big girl? Small girl, what? - Big. - Big. How big? Big girl? Big, fat girl, what? - 185. - 185 pounds. That's a big girl, all right. How'd she die? What, you have to think about that? How was she killed? - Strangled. - Strangled. So you're telling me that this little girl over here strangled a 185-pound street hooker? No, no, no, no. I never said that. - Yes, you did. - No, I said that I had a lead that she may have information concerning my investigation. I had a lead that there were two women... - He's lying. - ...Involved in a drug deal. That's not what you said at the door. - Yeah, it is. - No. You said you were looking for a fugitive. Your little narc buddy. That's what he said. "We're looking for a fugitive." Okay. Okay-- Kyle, right? Yes. I can understand you being a bit confused by all of this. I'm a bit confused by all this. A girl like this, she-- she shows up on your doorstep, and you're just... trying to do the right thing. And I get that. And I'm willing to forget about everything that has happened up until this moment. But you gotta understand, and you gotta know that you cannot trust anything that this girl says. - You are a fucking liar. - You cannot-- Liar! Scumbag. Just look at her. She's violent. - Huh? - He killed my friend. - She's paranoid. - He's lying to you. She's out of her head. You can't believe a word that she says. - Okay? - You know what? I do believe her. You're the one with the story that doesn't add up. Why don't you tell me about Mary? Who's Mary? I don't know any Mary or what the hell you're talking about. You don't know anybody named Mary. I don't know anybody named Mary. - Never met anybody named Mary? - Who is Mary? That's what we're gonna find out. I don't know any Mary! You disgust me. What are you doing? ( Lighter flicks ) Listen. You haven't done anything that can'! be overlooked. But if you're gonna do what I think you're about to do, you are crossing a line that you cannot come back from. I am a senior detective with the Williams County Sheriff Department. You are looking at seriously messing up your future right now. Put that down. Tell me where Mary is. I don't know any Mary. I swear to you, I don't know anything about a girl named-- ( screams ) - You gonna tell me where Mary is? - You're a fucking dead man! ( Screams ) Look at me. You're not gonna like where I put it next. -Okay. -Okay. Where is she? I killed her. Oh, God. I killed her. She-- she was just so little. And I didn't-- I didn't mean to. You have to understand. I didn't mean to hurt her. I'm a good person. ( crying ) Okay. We can call the cops. Hold on. That doesn't mean anything. He just confessed. And as soon as he is set free, he will say that he lied because you tortured him. He'll say he doesn't know any Mary and that he doesn't know anything about this, because we have no proof. We don't have her body. You're gonna take us to her body. - All right? - Yeah. - Right? - I will. I will. I just don't get it. Look at you. You're a senior detective with the Williams Sheriff's Department. James Harrison. Commended twice for bravery and distinguished service. I looked you up. You were promoted this spring over two other sergeants. Which is important 'cause it looks like the sheriffs gonna retire. Which makes you the next guy in line. And you're out in the woods doing blow with a couple of strippers? I don't do drugs. I've never done drugs. I know it was a mistake. I've never done anything like that before. Honestly. You're such a hypocrite. I hate hypocrites. I told you. That was an accident. An accident, huh? What about her? Was there gonna be another accident? You know, all this stuff we bought today is tax deductible. Seriously. It's for our jobs. I never heard of anyone writing off a negligee. - Why not? It's for work. - Oh. - I'm writing that stuff off. - Hope you get audited. I'd love to see the look on that IRS guy's face. (TV clicks on) Woman on TV: ...Jessica Kim, who was recently reported missing by her sister Lisa Kim. She is with me now. First of all, Lisa, how's the family holding up? - Mary. - It's hard, but we're confident - we're gonna find her. - Mary, come check this out. She has a husband and two children she loves very much. She wouldn't just disappear for this long without checking in, not unless something was wrong. Reporter: What would you like to say to Jessica - if she were watching right now? - This is bizarre. Jessica, if you're out there, please, please come home. We love you and we miss you and we want you back. And if someone out there has Jessica, please just let her come home to her family who loves her and misses her and is where she belongs. Please come home, Jessica. Reporter: There you have it, Roger. From the sister of Jessica Kim, who has now been missing almost a week. I'm Christy Gonzales. (TV clicks off) That's like four girls that have just vanished in the last year. I read in the paper that the dead girl they found in Flagstaff was strangled. Do you think they're all connected? I don't know. I don't wanna think about it. I'm gonna go try on some of my stuff. You lie, you cheat, you steal. Whatever serves your purpose. I want you to explain to me how you get to be where you are and I end up living in a cabin like a hermit... trying to put my life back together. Life's just a big game. It's about who has what and how you're gonna get it. You can either take life by the balls, get what you need, or you can be the victim. Either way, life doesn't give a shit about either one of us. - Is that how you rationalize it? - No. It's just how I learned to survive. And I'm damn good at it. So how's that working out for you tonight? Kyle? I don't want to see her like that. Yeah, all right. ( Music playing on radio) Mary: Maybe he's falling in love with me. (Annie laughs) Sure. Yeah, right. It's the whole dancer thing. Guys don'! take us seriously. Let's just blow them off, then. Why, you have something better to do? Mary, I'm coming because of you. I know, I know. Hey, look at it this way. We'll get some free coke. We'll go, we'll stay for like an hour. An hour. Okay. I mean it this time. I owe you one. - You owe me like 20. - I know. This time, I'll actually pay you back. - Who's your favorite bitch? - You are. I think this is it. - You think? - Yeah. This is it. What would it take to make you forget about this whole thing, huh? What do you want? I want you to find the grave. We'll stay out here all night if we have to. And then we'll look tomorrow. And then we'll look tomorrow night. And then we'll look the next day... - I thought this was the place! - ...until we find the grave! Look, it was daytime. - Everything looks different now. - Don't give me that! It's a full moon. I could read a book if I had one. I have cash. I have money stowed away that nobody knows about. Somehow that doesn't surprise me. What if I could clear your record, huh? How could you do that? I know people. People who could help. The judge in your case, the one that gave you six years for manslaughter. I play golf with him. He'd work with me. I would have your record expunged. No one would know you spent a day in jail. Think about it. It'd be a fresh start for you. Hell, I'll even pull some strings, get you a cushy civilian job on the force. Those guys make good money. What'd ya say? What do I say? Is that what you think? I'm an idiot?! You're a liar! Now let's go find the grave! We go back to the car and we start over. Kyle? Did you find her? - No. - You never will. ( Screams ) We gotta get them out of here. Back up to the cabin. We're gonna drive back up to the cabin? Got to. My DNA is all over that place. All that rotting wood. It'll be impossible to clean. We take them back up there and what? We kill them. And then we torch the place. Listen, Jim, I understand the thing about the girl. That was an accident. But now you're talking about a double-homicide. This could end up badly. We can handle it. You just gotta keep your head in the game. Think about what you're asking me to do. I don't think I can do it. You cannot back out now. You are in this neck-deep! And you know it! Fuck! Drive, bitch. You should have taken me up on my offer. Could've had some money, a job, a future. But now you're gonna end up a statistic. What a waste of a life. I told you. You could either take life by the balls and get what you want or you can play the victim. You made the wrong choice, Kyle. I like your bracelets. Oh, he's gonna tell me where the keys are. He's gonna tell me a lot of things. I'm gonna enjoy this. Payback's a bitch. You're pathetic. And I know why. - Yeah? - Yeah. You act like Mr. Big Man, Mr. Macho, Mr. Tough Guy, but Mary told me the truth. It's hard to be a tough guy when you're only packing four inches. I'd keep my mouth shut if I were you, bitch. (groaning ) That's old school. That's how I interrogate a suspect. But you.. You took it to a whole different level. You went-- You Went.. - Medieval. - Medieval. Yeah, that's it, like in the movie. You went there. And now it's my turn. And I'm gonna do it slowly. And I'm gonna make it hurt. You humiliated me. Now you're gonna pay for it. What are you doing standing there? Take her outside and kill her. Come on. Come on. Maybe we can finish what we started earlier. What? When we were partying? Maybe we can finish that. You'd do that? If I could live a little longer... and do something I've always enjoyed. Yeah. I'll do it. Yeah. Okay. ( gasps ) We'll save that for later. (groaning ) Ooh. How do you like your meat, Kyle? Rare? Medium? Oh, fuck. Me, I like mine well-done. (groaning louder) Whoa! No, no, no! (yells) I was beginning to think he didn't have the balls. (crying ) Like I said, Kyle, life's a game. You didn't actually think you were going to win, did you? ( laughs ) See, I've been winning my whole life. It's what I do. Nobody beats James Harrison. Not you, not anyone. Kyle. Are you ready? - That wasn't so hard. - ( screams ) - Was it? - Get me out of this! Bite it, bite it, bite it! - ( Growls ) - Get it off me! Get it off me! Get it off! No! Annie! - ( Screams ) - Motherfucker! ( Screaming ) (vase smashing ) (grunting ) ( screams ) (gasping and choking ) ( shrieks ) MY eyes! This is all you-- - fucking- - Ah! Look at me. Look at me. We're gonna be okay. We're gonna be all right. You're gonna be okay. This is so surreal. It's just wrong. Well, we got no choice. Nothing else we can do. Two dead cops. We killed them. We're never gonna find Mary's body. Nobody's gonna believe us. I don't wanna spend the rest of my life in a six-foot by eight-foot cage. I can't believe it. 24 hours ago, I was rolling out of bed, just like every other day. None of this had ever happened. It's like another lifetime. Annie: I don't think Cooger was such a bad guy. He just got caught up in it, like we did. And I killed him. He didn't deserve to die. I saw a film once where this guy says, "I don't deserve to die." And this other dude looks at him and says, "Deserving's got nothing to do with it." Then he blows his head off. That's what I believe. Deserving's got nothing to do with it. I still say if anyone deserves to be in that hole, Harrison does. Have you heard about all the girls that have gone missing in the area? There's one dead and two missing in Flagstaff. Two from Page and one missing girl right here in Williams. What about 'em? Well, do you think he had something to do with it? I mean, he killed Mary. We know he was gonna kill me. Nah. I don't see it like that. Harrison was a victim of his own vices. If the girls you're referring to are dead, it's a serial killer. It's a completely different mindset. How so? Well, serial killers are almost always sociopaths. They don't feel empathy for other people. They've got no conscience. They don't feel bad about the things that they do, even though they know that society condemns them. So they're slippery. Good liars. Sometimes, they can be quite charming. Guy like that has probably had those impulses ever since he was a little child. What kind of impulses? To hurt people. Women, mostly. Makes them feel powerful and in control.
