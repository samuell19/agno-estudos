First and foremost, a special thank you to Mr. Frank O'Brien, who lends us his diner every year to accommodate all of you lovely people. Frank, take a bow. - [cheering] - Thank you.

This could be the year. This is it! Now, see, folks? That is the spirit! Let's hear it! Thank you, Frank. Now I would like to acknowledge the woman who, for the past 20 years, has made this an annual event not to be missed. I want you to put your hands together and give it up for the sweetest woman you'll ever meet, pun intended, Linda Sullivan! - [screams] - [cheering] EARL: Come on up, Linda! Come on up! Hi, everybody! Thank you so much for coming tonight. Remember, the winner of tonight's contest receives a featured spot on my bakery's menu for a full year, with the sales proceeds benefiting Chestnut Elementary's after-school programs. Yes. Also... a special spot alongside previous champions in my famous recipe tin. - Pretty big deal, right? - [applause] And last but not least, a year full of bragging rights.

I don't think he's gonna be very happy about that. - It's your job. - All right. [sighs] What's going on? It's about your aunt. - Time for a caffeine break. - Excellent! Thanks, Pop. You know, I'm retired from the military now, so you might want to think about retiring that old coffee mug. Oh, never! That thing looks like it's had a few tours of its own. Your service to our country is my proudest thing in life. Ah, thanks, Pop. That being said, I can't wait to see what you got planned for a second act. Pop, don't start. We're not trying to push you, son. - Really? - It's just that... everybody in her book club, they all have grandkids already. Wait a minute. Are you seriously trying to guilt me with Mom's book club right now? Dad, I just retired two months ago. - I'm gonna figure it out. - And then? I know what's happening here.

You think I just call people into my office when they're in trouble? Is that the reputation I have out on the floor? Don't answer that. I asked you to come in because I had a very interesting phone call this morning from Logan Keller. Logan Keller, the CEO of... Keller Department Stores. Thanks to the campaign that you spearheaded, profits for the holiday season are up 25% from last year. - Wow. - 30% from the year before that. Well, if you're gonna thank anyone, it would be Gordon Royce because he's the star of the campaign. Yeah, but who's idea was it to put Gordon Royce in the ads in the first place? Mine, sir. Stone, I've made a decision. It's time to promote you to junior partner. Junior partner? More responsibility, more money, brand-new office and an assistant. How's that sound? Unless you're not interested. No, of course I'm interested. No, I'm sorry, it's, uh... I just found out that my aunt passed away. I am sorry to hear that. - That's okay. - Were you close? Yeah, I was, actually. She... She raised me after my parents died. Well, then... what are you doing? What do you mean? You should be making travel plans. I can't. I'm too busy. Stone, believe me when I tell you nothing is more important than family. - You were married three times. - Exactly. And what was the name of that town that you grew up in? - Walnut? - Chestnut. - Must have been quaint. - It is, actually. Believe it or not, I grew up in a small town myself. Population, 500. Well, Chestnut's not that much bigger than that. For heaven's sakes, go. - Pay respects to your aunt. - Are you sure? Yeah. Just be back in time for the Christmas Eve party. That's where we'll be making announcements for new junior partnerships. I will. Thank you. Thank you so much.

I know, but I could have at least been there for her. I didn't get to say goodbye. Well, she was so proud of you. Living across the country, New York City, your big job. The last thing she would have wanted was to pull you away. Then why didn't you tell me? Because nobody really knew how serious it was. Not even her staff. She closed the bakery. Yeah, well, that was while she recovered. She seemed fine after they put her on this heart medication. We were supposed to reopen after Christmas, but... [sighs] Come on. You know how Linda was. Always so upbeat. Always looking out for everyone else. Yeah. But still, I... She shouldn't have died alone. ♪♪ - Thank you. - Sure, no problem. - You want me to go in with you? - No, it's all right.

Amy? - Amy Stone! - Earl. You know, Luke said you were coming back to town. Yeah, you know, I had to come back for my aunt's funeral. Oh, I was so sorry to hear about your aunt. She was a sweet, sweet lady. No pun intended. Thank you. She was, wasn't she? Chestnut will never be the same without her bakery and especially without her annual Christmas Cookie Contest. Yeah, she sure did keep that tradition alive, didn't she? You know I host it now? I took over hosting for my dad a few years after he died. Oh, that's great. I'm so sorry, though, about your dad. It's okay, yeah. Would you believe this would have been the 50th anniversary? It's a shame it's over. Wow. 50 years. Wow. Anyway, it's super great catching up with you, but I gotta get back to the studio, you know? The voice of Chestnut never rests. Great seeing you. Hey, since you're in town, why don't you come on by? You can go on the air, tell stories about your aunt. Oh, I would love that. I have to take care of this and get back to New York. My work. Let me know if you change your mind. Thank you, I will. So great seeing you! Amy Stone, as I live and breathe. [laughs] - Hi. - Can I help you? - Yeah, I'm here to see... - Amy! Dylan? [chuckling] I expected your father. Ah, yeah, Pop retired about a year ago. - Oh, really? - Yeah. Oh, huh. No, thank you. Wow. Dylan Carruthers, the boy who stole my bike in fourth grade and shoved a kid in a locker in high school is now a lawyer. A lot changed since you left. I bet. I would've thought you'd be on the other side of the law. No offense. [laughs] Well, you're just in time. So since we're all here, why don't we go in and get started? We? Yeah. You remember Jack. Jack? Hello, Amy. [door closes] Uh, what's he doing here? Nice to see you too. Well, he's mentioned in the will. What? I loved your aunt just as much as you did. Okay, let's have a seat. Your aunt was very precise with her will. She was short and sweet. Basically, you two are equal partners. - Equal? - Partners? Yeah, to put it simply, she gave you both her entire estate: her house, her car, savings account, had about $4,000 in it, and of course, the bakery. BOTH: The bakery? Like I said, short and sweet. - I don't understand. - What she really wants to know is why she has to share with me. Look, if this is what my aunt wanted, then fine. We'll sell everything, split the proceeds 50/50 and go about our lives. Happy? It's all yours. Dylan, are there documents or something that we need to sign for this? Well, I, uh... - In a rush? - Actually... Heaven forbid you actually have to spend time in your hometown. You know, with us lowly people. Actually, I have a life in New York with a job and a promotion to junior partner. - Ooh, junior partner! - Yeah. I have to be back for a meeting on the 24th. Christmas Eve. Who do you work for? Ebeneezer Scrooge? Well, if you must know, I happen to work for the biggest agency in New York City. I know. I saw the Keller Department Store campaign. Very impressive. Oh, really? Like you would see that. Question for you. Are those Gordon Royce's real teeth? I mean, just break it down to me because no human really has teeth that look like that. [laughing] You cyberstalked me. - I didn't cyber anything. - Yeah, you did. I mean, is that even really a word? Oh, sorry. What would you call it then? - Curiosity. - Whatever. You stalked me. Anyway... If God didn't want people to know about each other, he wouldn't have invented Google. Okay, are you two quite finished? - Sorry. - Okay. - There's just one more thing. - Mm-hmm. Linda has a letter for you. "Dear Amy and Jack..." AUNT LINDA: "I hope you know how proud I am of the adults the two of you have become. I don't want my passing to be a sad occasion. That's why I'm asking the two of you to reopen the bakery for the holidays and to present the 50th Annual Christmas Cookie Contest. After that, you and Jack are free to do whatever you want with the bakery and my house. I just want one last hurrah before the bakery closes for good. Will you please do that for me?" DYLAN: "All my love, Linda." Reopen the bakery? I mean, we haven't worked there since we were teenagers, and she has a whole staff, doesn't she? Well, you know, uh, to be honest... lately it's been kind of lean. Jeanette's worked for her for years. Why couldn't she do it? You're not obligated to do any of these things. It's just the last wish of a dying woman. Oh, great. I mean, this is seriously one heck of a guilt trip. - A guilt trip? - Yeah, a guilt trip. That's what you took away from that? A guilt trip? I can't even look at her right now. You know what, Jack? I'll make it easy for you. Goodbye. [door slams] - Amy! - What? Does this place really mean that little to you? Did I say that? That bakery has been in your family for years. We practically grew up there. You could have at least given your aunt a moment's respect before you threw the whole idea out the window. - Christmas is a week away. - So what? So you think that we can reopen a bakery and hold a cookie contest in a week? - Why not? - It's impossible, Jack. The Amy Stone I knew didn't even know the meaning of that word. You know what? I have responsibilities that I have to get back to in New York. I'm sorry. I just thought you might want to do something nice for the woman that raised you, but you have a life to get back to, junior partner. - Yeah, I do. - Nice to see you again. Uh-huh, you too. ♪♪ ♪♪ Let's have a little more flour here. Can you put some flour here, Amy? Thanks, Jack. Boom, boom, boom! AMY: Oh, my gosh! It might be a little overdone, but no worries. Yeah, they are. It's okay. - That's fine. - All right! Well... We can make another batch. Uh, well... [thud] [laughter] JACK: So divide the eight into this. Okay. That's great! You are gonna do so well on that test tomorrow. - Thank you. - [laughs] JEANETTE: What are we gonna do? Amy was right. Even if we did it, it would've taken a Christmas miracle to turn that place around so quickly. And getting the word out about the contest at this point, I don't see how we could've done it. Amy? She's on her way to the airport. Jack, Amy, she's here. Hey! - Hey, guys. - Hi! So, thought you'd be eating peanuts at 39,000 feet by now. I'm sorry about earlier. You're right. My aunt deserves better than this, and if the contest is that important to her, then we're gonna make it happen. What about your big promotion? Well, if I'm good enough to make junior partner, then he's gonna have to cut me some slack. Sounds like you're rehearsing. Haven't told him yet, have you? No, not yet. Ah. Well, just treat him like you treat me, and you'll be just fine. Well, guys, it's the 16th. We've only got nine days till Christmas. That's all we need when you got good friends to help. We'll get the bakery up and running. We'll have the cookie contest on Christmas Eve. Jeanette, you're rehired with a 10% raise. Luke, you're done teaching until school starts again - in January? - Yeah. Could you use your economic skills and please help us with our finances? Whatever it takes. I'll take the marketing campaign, since that's my area of expertise. So what do I do? You'll... just figure it out. Okay, well if you guys are done eating, let's go. What just happened? I don't know, but don't knock it. Linda's bakery is back in business! Frank, check, please. JEANETTE: Let's go. Anything? I got her voicemail. Give it to me. I can handle a voicemail. Bradley. Stone, it's Don. Listen, when we announce your junior partnership, I'd like you to make an acceptance speech. 90 seconds. No reading off index cards. Memorize it. And by the way, when exactly are you coming back? We'll have Bradley pick you up at the airport. Call me. - I don't have a car. - You don't have a car? This is New York City. Who doesn't have a car? You don't have a car. I don't need a car. I have a driver. - Well, send the driver. - Bradley, this is Christmas. The poor woman had to go home for her aunt's funeral. I'm trying to do something nice for a change. I'm sorry. How many people did I fire today? None. Exactly. Yesterday? - None. - Exactly. And the day before that? None. No, actually you did fire Mr. Lundberg from legal. Oh, yeah, yeah, I did. Yeah, okay, well, but I'm trying to make a change. Yeah, of course. - To be nice. - Be nice. So be nice and... I'll make arrangements for a car service ASAP. That's the spirit. - And, Bradley? - Yeah? - Let's send Mr. Lindberg... - Lundberg. Lundberg, a fruit cake. Let him know there's no hard feelings. Okay. Good. AMY: Well, what do you think? Really hasn't changed that much, has it? Linda was always big on tradition. Well, that's exactly what we're gonna do, run things the way she used to. Honey, where did Linda keep all her financials? AP, invoices? Need to get a handle on where we're at. Oh, yeah. Hold on a second. Let's see. Yup, right here. Here we go, hon. You've got to be kidding me. Really? Maybe she had an abacus to go with it? Mind if I talk to you for a second? - Sure. - A couple of hours ago, you were taking a cab to the airport, so who made you leader? No one. Why? You want the job? No, no. You've always been type-A, so by all means, you take it. Thank you. You're welcome. And just to clarify, that was a compliment, right? Maybe. So what does that make you? - Silent partner? - Good. So shush. She did not just shush me. She just shushed me. Yup. You were shushed. You just shushed me. Yes, I did. Let's go check out the kitchen and see what we need to do in there, guys. Yeah, I'll check the pantry for Linda's recipe tin. JACK: You guys weren't kidding. This place really hasn't been updated. You know, for a silent partner, you talk a lot. - What? - So when do we open? I think we can get this up and running in a day or two. Not here. Guys, we got a problem. Just one? I can't find Linda's recipe tin. Oh, come on. She still didn't keep her recipes in it. - Seriously? - Well, she was old-fashioned. Would it have been too much for her to get a computer? Yeah, tell me about it. Well, come on, it's gotta be around here somewhere, right? Well, you know what? I'll just keep checking. And in the meantime, I have some cookbooks at home. No. We can't open Linda's bakery without Linda's cookies. That tin was her prized possession. It had every secret recipe in it. Well, I don't see it around here anywhere. All right, why don't you guys keep looking? I'll call Dylan. - Okay. - Okay. SECRETARY: Mr. Carruthers, Amy Stone for you, line one. [sighs] Thank you. Amy! [chuckles] How's it goin' down there so far? Could be better. I can't find Linda's recipe tin. Do you have any idea where it's at? What does it look like? You know exactly what it looks like. Remember, when we were kids and you knocked it over and it took Aunt Linda three days to put every card back? - Oh, that. - Yes, that. I can't believe after all these years you still think I did that on purpose. Yes, because I saw you do it. No, see, that's where you're mistaken. It was an accident. We were kids. We were playing around. And no, I haven't seen it. Okay, thanks. We'll keep looking. All right, you guys get those cookies done. - Bye now. - Bye. [sighs] I don't know why, but talking to him kinda makes my skin crawl. It's been a long time. People change. Doubt it. Linda must have taken the tin home for safekeeping. Well, lucky for us, I have a key to her house, so if it's there, I will find it. Great. Nice! It's starting to look like the bakery again. - It's coming along, huh? - It is. Are you sure you're able to get all the baking done tomorrow? Well, as long as we find Linda's recipes, I'll stay as long as I have to. I think that we should bring cookbooks just as backup. - Plan B? - Plan B. - You got it. - Okay, well, good night, guys. - Mañana. - Mañana. Good night, Jack. See you tomorrow. Good night, Amy.

I thought you'd never ask. Jeanette and Luke already told you, didn't they? Yeah, but it was fun hearing you say it again. It wouldn't be the same without you. I wouldn't let you do it without me. Well, perfect! It's settled. I do have one favor though. You want to come on the air and promote the grand reopening. Yeah, I do. It would be such an amazing way to get the word out. Absolutely. How's the day after tomorrow? Perfect. I can do a whole little countdown, like the 12 Days of Christmas, only sweeter and just a little shorter. I love it. Guess I'd better start baking. Right!

The rush is nothing spreads the word like the smell of fresh-baked cookies wafting through the town. Edible advertising. Genius. Exactly. Hey, Luke, how are the finances? Well, applying the same criteria I give to my students, I'd say we're looking at about a D-plus. That is passing, right? I mean, theoretically, D-plus is passing. Yeah.

And don't forget the 50th anniversary of the cookie contest. Christmas Eve. Yeah, should be fun. Make those same things you used to make when I was younger. Take a cookie. There you go. You sure? Hey, Merry Christmas. What do you think? Cocolita's is back in business. Christmas Eve, cookie contest. - What do we have fresh today? - Everything is fresh! Today we have sugar shakes, Christmas Crusties, gingerbread men, snowmen s'mores. We have chocolate, we have peanut butter, we have jelly presses, sprinkled Pringles. - Snickerdoodles. - Snickerdoodles! - Snickerdoodles? - Great choice. Excellent choice. That'll be 9.99, sir. All right, look, I'm doing everything I can to make sure the bakery's not too successful. That's all I'm gonna say. You're just gonna have to trust me on this, all right?

Today we have fresh sugar shakes, Christmas Crusties... Here you go. Take care, enjoy. Thank you. These are selling so fast. JEANETTE: I know. Oh, hi, how are you? Jack, what kind are you making right now? - These are peanut butter. - Peanut butter? - LUKE: Okay, turn it. - JACK: I just did turn it. We got nothing. Here, let me give it a shot. [laughs] What do you know about this stuff? When I was in Germany, I used to hang out with the motor pool guys, and I paid attention. Come on! Yeah, like an armored Humvee has so much in common with at '66 pickup. Come on, son, step aside. Let me show you how it's done. Mm-hmm, let's see it. All right, well, first of all, looks like these distributor cables are all out of order. - You see that? - No, show me. What? Right here. - All right. - I'll bet you that's it. Okay, all right. So whatever happened to that Becky girl that you met in the pro shop? She's probably still taking tee times in the pro shop. Couldn't see yourself hanging out at a country club? No, not really my scene. Want to give it a shot now? I got a six-pack says it doesn't work. Well, you're on, and I'm thirsty. Hit it. [ignition fails] Nada. - Nothing? - Nothing. Did you hear from Leigh? Oh, Leigh started officer training school last year. I guess, what I mean, Jack, is did you hear from Leigh? Well, I checked her online status once, saw that she was in a relationship. I think it's with somebody from the program, and she seemed very happy. - Are you? - What's up? You're my therapist all of a sudden? Listen, man, there's all these girls, and they're all terrific girls. What about the one, the waitress you met at the steak house? The one you showed me the picture of. She was so smoking hot. Oh, man, those were the best steaks. I was talking about the girl, Jack, the girl. Well, Luke, she wasn't the one. I mean, not for all the steaks in Jacksonville was she the one. What are you waiting for, man? You're not getting any younger, and you're certainly not getting any better looking. Yeah, and I'm also not gonna settle. So when I fall in love, when I find the one, I, you'll see, this guy will not hesitate to pull the trigger. And in the meantime, how about we fix this truck? Give it another shot. [engine starts] - Whoa! - Yeah! Let's take her for a spin. Come on! EARL: It's time for one of my favorite segments, local eats. And I've got big news. Keeping our Christmas cookie town tradition alive, are the new co-owners of Cocolita Cakes, Amy Stone and Jack Evans. Thank you, Earl. We're very happy to be here. Now, for those of you that don't know, Amy and Jack used to help run this contest when they were kids. Yes, we did. What's it like being back, doing it again after all these years? Oh, it's so great. We're so excited about this contest... [laughs] No, I mean you and Jack? Everybody with a memory that goes back that far knows that you two lovebirds were the hottest ticket in town back in the day. [scoffs] I don't know. 'Cause we're here to talk about the contest. - So no sparks then? - That was a long time ago. Alrighty then. What can folks expect from this contest? AMY: We're celebrating the 50th Anniversary of the Christmas Cookie Contest. We're asking everyone to bring a treat down, and you can sample it, maybe win, and in the end, you know, you can have a cookie or two or, you know, share some holiday cheer. Speaking of cheer, are you two going to be toasting anything in particular this holiday? Just the bakery. Jack, do you have a girlfriend right now? - I don't... - Don't answer that. So you're single. And, Amy, are you single? I'm going to be baking. We are talking about these wonderful cookies and keeping Aunt Linda's tradition alive. Okay, let's take a caller. Caller? You're on the air with Jack and Amy from Cocolita's. WOMAN: I'm so glad I got through! Amy and Jack, I was a freshman when you guys were seniors. Every girl wanted to be just like you guys. What happened? We're just here to talk about the bakery. Contest. Remember, it's the cookie contest - that we're talking about. - Sorry. The contest. Yeah, the contest. [laughs] Okay, caller, thanks for the call. And I recommend everybody here in Chestnut come on down to this contest and see what Amy and Jack are up to for themselves. Great. We look forward to it. ♪ Whoa ho ho ♪ ♪ Meet me underneath the mistletoe ♪ ♪ Whoa ho ho ♪ ♪ Won't you spend Christmas here with me ♪ Hey, who's trying to be a baker? Hey, not trying, my friend, doing. I think I finally figured out the difference between your very mediocre sugar cookies and Linda's Santa Sparks. Yeah, this coming from a guy who struggles to reheat a slice of pizza. Oh, ha. You know, I watched her bake these my entire childhood. I'll bet you I nailed it. Look who it is. I hate to admit it, but it looks like all those marketing skills that you picked up in the big city are finally paying off. And why would you hate to admit that? That came out wrong. Okay, I guess so. I'm gonna get some fresh air. Do you want to help me pass out some flyers for the contest? Sure, but before we go, the guys baked some cookies. No, no, no. Jack baked some cookies. I made some cookies. Oh, really? Mm-hmm. Hmm. Shall I try one of them? Closest thing to the Santa Sparks, am I right? - No. - What? Ugh. Now I know you're trying to kill me. Oh, come on. Go ahead. What? They can't be that bad. Hmm. Ooh. [laughter] - They're bad! - I know. I don't get it. I used just normal cookie ingredients. I used butter, flour, and sugar. Yeah, well, I hate to break it to you, Jack, but this isn't sugar. It's salt. - Oops. - Whoops. Okay, well, while we're gone, don't let him bake anything, and you might wanna write "salt" in big letters on that container. With permanent ink. I understand, Jack. They both look alike. Better luck next time. ♪♪ Don't forget to enter the Christmas Cookie Contest. It's in four days. So how many people have entered? Not many, but there's always a last rush, so I'm not worried. I wish I could be as relaxed as you are. Oh, please. Hi. Oh, hi. I heard you and your boyfriend on the radio the other day. Oh, he's not my boyfriend. Nothing to be embarrassed about. With a pretty face like yours, I'm sure he'll come around in no time. Well, thank you, but it's not really like that. [chuckles] - Mm-hmm. - What? Maybe the universe is trying to tell you something. Oh, really? And by universe, you mean the town gossip? Well, the two of you were the envy of high school, so... Please, stop. - What? - What do you mean, what? Prom king and queen. The whole school just swooned when the two of you took the dance floor. That was a long time ago. Time moves on, and so have we. Please! He still looks at you like that. Oh, my gosh, just stop. Come on, let's go over here. - What? - We have a... - For real. - I don't care. I'm telling you! [mouthing words] Don't tell Amy, but... that's the one. Your secret is safe with me. Speaking of Amy, what's going on with you guys? What do you mean? Come on. You're together as kids, you're on again, off again, you guys are both here now. You know the story, Luke. She left me. That was 20 years ago. Well, we had plans 20 years ago. - You could have gone with her. - It doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is doing what Linda wanted, which is reopening this bakery, holding the celebration, and that's it. After that, I'm gone. Mm-hmm. You sure about that? Well, evidently, you're not sure about it, so why don't you just come out and say it? Maybe you don't see it, but the rest of us see it. Jeanette, I, everybody. There's still chemistry between you guys. I just think you're a little quick to write it off. So what am I supposed to do? I don't know. Ask her to dinner. After everything that's happened? I'm pretty sure she still has to eat. But hey, it's none of my business, man. You'll figure it out. I nailed it. ♪♪ I think it's time we call it a night. Thanks. - Good night. - See you tomorrow. AMY: Good night. - Tomorrow, my man. - Yep. - [sighs] - Well... Yeah, well, I will have you know that I'm getting very close to cracking the code to Linda's Santa Sparks. Oh, wow, really? Yeah. No, I mean, sorry, Luke is getting close. Not me because... - Right, because you don't bake? - Right, I'm not allowed. - I would never bake. - No, I didn't think so. Has anyone ever told you you're a terrible liar? Yeah, I've heard that once before. - I'm sure you have. - Mm-hmm. Well, I think we wasted enough cookie dough for one day, so... - Amy. - Jack. Faith. Faith. Come on. I want you to put that on. I want you to follow me. Come on. Okay. - JACK: Flour. - AMY: Two cups. JACK: Sugar. AMY: Half a cup. Uh, you said... There's the half a cup. Salt. Two cups, right? Uh, let's do a teaspoon this time. Good idea. You're the boss. I know. Teaspoon? And I'll need a rolling pin. Rolling pin, here we go. Watch this. Wow. You look like a professional baker. It's all coming back to me now. Wow. Some of my best memories are right here in this room. You know, the first time I ever saw you was right at this table. You were helping Linda bake, and you were stealing chocolate chips out of the bag. I was. Uh, I think I need more flour. Let's get you some flour. You know what, Amy? I think it's time for a peace offering between us. And as a token of peace, I would like you to please accept this bouquet. No. Don't you dare. No! What are you doing? - Flour! - [gasps] I cannot believe you did that. [laughs] It's not my fault! The newscaster said there was a slight chance of flurries. - Well, you know what? - What? His forecast is way off because you know why? - Why? - You wanna know why? - Why? - We got hit with a blizzard! [laughing] [sighs] You think there's ever any chance of this storm letting up? It's clearing. That's good. I'm hungry. Would you like to... Maybe we should go out and have dinner. - Have dinner. - Okay, if you don't... - Yes, I mean, if you... - You do? - I do. - I do.

This is the voice of Chestnut, Earl Pratt Jr., reminding you that the countdown is on, people. We've got less than one week to go until the 50th Annual Christmas Cookie Contest. Now, some of you have tried to get ahead and bring some cookies by the radio studio to bribe me, and I want to say I am not above being bribed with cookies. AMY: Let me get this straight. You're offering us $400,000 for the bakery and the house as a package deal? Not a bad Christmas bonus, huh? I took the liberty of having the contracts drawn up. Well, shouldn't we have the property appraised first? Ah, yes, the property has been appraised by a neutral third party, and you'll see that it appraises for far less than what I'm offering you. Look, I know you two aren't gonna be sticking around here. You've got your life in New York, you've got your life in Florida. Think of this as me helping you guys out. What about the bakery? The bakery? Well... that's a historic landmark. I mean, you can't put a price tag on that. And I'd like to see to it that it's taken care of in a proper manner. I understand. I just don't know if this is something that my aunt would've wanted, you know? Well, consider it a peace offering for all the crap I put you through when we were kids. Well, I guess that puts us right back where we started - with liquidating the assets. - AMY: Mm-hmm. Unless, of course, there's some outside chance that you might be thinking of staying. I can't. I have to get back to my job. JACK: No, of course. - And you have Florida. - Yeah. You have to figure that out. Doesn't seem to make sense to, you know. - No. - All right, well, let's do it. - Okay. - Where do we sign? Right by the little red flags. Or orange, in this case. Thank you. That's nice and handy. All right. RECEPTIONIST ON INTERCOM: Mr. Carruthers? Mr. Brewer's on line one. Okay, thanks, Jillian, I'll be right out. Will you excuse me for one second? - Oh, no problem. - Take your time. DYLAN: It shouldn't be too long. I've been waiting on a phone call. - There you go. - Thank you. Thank you. Your worries are over. - Amy? - Hold on. What are you doing? Shh. One second. DYLAN: Property's been safely secured under my name. No, I got the signed documents right here in my hand. I'll transfer the title over to Espressos "R" Us January 1. Espressos "R" Us. - What? - Yeah, I knew it. Wait. You don't think that he's trying to... Yes, I heard him. Well, maybe you misheard him. I did not mishear him. Oh! Jack. - No! - Yes! Snooping? Espressos "R" Us? You caught me. There's no crime in flipping property, right? Especially when said property does belong to me. Oh, that I found this morning. I was just about to give it back to you. You're unbelievable. You know... [sighs] you haven't changed a bit. You gonna punch me in the face? Is that what they teach you in the military? No, no, I'm gonna do something much, much worse. Merry Christmas. DYLAN: Oh, guys. You are so fired, got it? [door closes] - Is that it? - Yep. Behold, for in my hands, I hold the top secret ingredients to Linda's Santa Sparks. - Let's see. - What were we doing wrong? Oh. - "Peppermint extract." - Peppermint extract! - Why didn't we think of that? - I don't know. - It's so simple. - Deceptively simple. All right, guys, let's start baking the Santa Sparks. Do we have any peppermint extract? - I'm sure we have it somewhere. - We gotta find some. [phone rings] Hello? Hey, Don. I am so sorry that I haven't gotten back to you. Oh, zip it, Stone. If you work for me, you take my calls 24/7, you got it? - Got it, sorry. - We are in crisis mode here. Why? The Christmas Eve party isn't for three days. With everything that happened, there may not be a party. If you hadn't fallen off the radar, you'd know that the charming movie star you hired for the Keller's campaign, was just seen online in a photograph that's gone viral. - Naked? - Worse. - Arrested? - Worse! He got caught cheating with a Christmas shopping bag from Luff's. - Luff's? - You can imagine the reaction from our friends at Keller's. They've canceled the whole campaign and given us 48 hours to come up with a new one with ads, billboards, TV spots, the works. Don, we can't turn a campaign around that quickly. - I mean, it's just impossible. - Well, it's gotta be done or we lose our biggest client. - I understand, but... - There's no buts about it! You get on that next plane back to New York or you're out of a job! Have I made myself clear? Yes, sir. I'll be on the next plane to New York. - Good! - See you then. Bye. [sighs] What? That was awesome. - Get out of here. - Okay. So that's it, huh? One phone call, and you're leaving. You're eavesdropping? I guess some things really haven't changed, have they? I don't have a choice. No, no, you always have a choice, but it's clear where your heart lies, so just do what you've gotta do. Come on, you know I had to be back. You made a commitment to see this through, to honor your own aunt's wishes, her final wishes. And I honored that commitment. The bakery's open, the contest is set, we found her recipes. You don't need me here. The three of you, you guys can finish this without me. But that's not really what this is about, is it? Then tell me, what is this really about? It's about you and me! You're taking this personal! I also have a commitment to my job that I've neglected. And I'm sorry you don't understand that. Well, good. You know what? 'Cause there's that job again in New York. Amy. JEANETTE: What happened? JACK: Good! Then do what you do best, walk away! ♪♪ I'm gonna check inside. Call Jeanette, see if she's called her. [line ringing] Hey, babe. Is she still there? Jack's checking, but I don't think so. I tried to call, but I just keep getting her voicemail. I'll try again. Let me know if you hear anything. I will. How's Jack doing? I don't know. He's too... Honey, he's coming out right now. I gotta go. - Love you. - I love you too. Well? I blew it. EARL: So what do you think? I don't know, man. By the time he got to the house, she had cleared all her stuff out. Oh, hey, buddy. - Hey. - JEANETTE: So? Anything? [sighs] Nothing, nothing. Left a bunch of voicemails. She's gone. Look, whatever you decide to do, we're behind you. Yeah, it's your call, man. The contest is on. You sure? We're gonna honor Linda by keeping her tradition going. Can't just throw it away because I blew things with Amy again. Come on, don't beat yourself up. People are expecting it. They're excited. I'm not gonna let everyone down. Hey, like I said before, we're in. Linda would have been so proud of you. Yeah, well, wish things would've turned out a little differently. Okay, so if we're gonna do this, we have three days before the contest. We gotta light a fuse for Linda. - For Linda. - For Linda.

My business partner, Amy Stone, couldn't be with us tonight. On behalf of her and my incredible business partners, Luke and Jeanette Crowder, and Frank O'Brien for letting us use his diner once again... - Yes! Frank! - [cheers and applause] ...it is my great honor to welcome you to the 50th Annual Christmas Cookie Contest. - Yeah! - [cheers and applause] Now as most of you know, Linda Sullivan, the founder of the bakery and this great tradition is no longer with us. So we would like to dedicate tonight to Linda as a celebration of her inspirational life. And now without further ado, I would like to introduce to you your host and cookie judge for this evening, the voice of Chestnut radio, Mr. Earl Pratt. Thank you, thank you, thank you! Now, as many of you know, my father, Earl Sr., hosted this event for many, many years, and I am so happy and honored to be here tonight on this very special occasion, the 50th anniversary of the Christmas Cookie Contest. - Yes! Yes! - [applause] Linda, we miss you, but we are gonna do you proud tonight. So who is my very first extra brave, vic... Extra brave soul who wants to come on up here and be judged? Don't be shy, come on. Come on up here. These yours? Yes. What's your name? - Shari. - Shari, it's nice to meet you. Now, I know you made these cookies, but I'm pretty sure you made that sweater too, am I right? - Yes. - How do I know that? Because the cookies match the sweater. Look at that! The cookies match the sweater! I'm not lying! This lady is coordinated. Moment of truth, Shari. Here we go. Now, before I do this, though, I want to remind each and every one of you that I will be judging each cookie tonight by the very scientific D-A-T method. And if you think D-A-T sounds like I made it up, you're right, I did, I made it up. But what does it stand for? Well, the D stands for design. The A, aroma. And last but not least, T for taste. That's good. It's very good, Shari. Thank you so much. All right, who's next? Let's get this party started, all right? - Am I getting ginger? - That's a good nose, Earl. I was always more of a Mary Ann man myself. I smell pine. You smell the pine? Smells like pine. Red velvet, interesting. Red for Christmas, right? I have to commend you. You do understand decorating. I've only been practicing for 30 years. Aroma. Smells like Christmas. Fruit filling, bold choice. That is good. Okay, thank you so much. Ugh, I got kitchen cleaner. I'm sorry. WOMAN: Oh, come on! Very cloying on the tongue. Like a milk or a cocoa or something. Mmm! Mmm! Mm. - This is really good. - I think he likes it! Okay, thank you so much. Do you have a favorite yet? - You know, I think I do. - Good. EARL: Now, have I missed any entries? Good, because I am stuffed like a Christmas turkey. Now after very careful and highly subjective deliberation, I have settled on a winner for the 50th Annual Christmas Cookie Contest. May I have the grand prize ribbon, please? I thought you had it. No, I thought you did. I don't have it. - Do you have it? - No, I don't. I've got it! Amy? ♪♪ Sorry. I knew I forgot something. You flew all the way back from New York to deliver a ribbon?

And I promise I didn't use any salt. Hmm. Not bad. That's it? Not bad? They're perfect. ♪♪ I thought tonight went really, really well. Yeah, it was perfect for the 50th, don't you think? Yes, and thank you guys so much for your hard work. Here it is. The award-winning Melting Snowman recipe. - I feel honored. Thank you. - Thank you. - It's in the tin. - Yes, it is. JACK: Finally in the tin, Frank. - What is that? - I don't know. It's Aunt Linda's handwriting. FRANK: Let me hold that for you. Open it up. What's it say? I don't know. Oh, wow. "Dear Amy and Jack, if you found this, it means you've decided to take me up on my request to reopen the bakery and hold the contest again." AUNT LINDA: "You might have wondered why I chose you two for this assignment, and with any luck, you've already figured it out. You two always had a special place in my heart, but most importantly, you had a special place in each other's. I don't want to sell my bakery to some big corporate entity. I started it as a place for the families of Chestnut to come and enjoy themselves. I want you to continue the tradition, and maybe one day you'll have a family of your own. Until then, this bakery and all of the joy it brings is my Christmas gift to you both." "Merry Christmas with all my love, Aunt Linda." It's too bad you missed the contest. There's always next year. Next year? What do you mean by that? Well, we can't let tradition fade away, right? We have a responsibility to the town and to Aunt Linda. Are you suggesting what I think you're suggesting? Yep. I'm moving back. I'm gonna live in Aunt Linda's house and run the bakery year round. Do you want to be my head baker? - I do. - Accountant? - Oh, yeah. - I can do promotions. Yes, you can, Earl. Now wait a minute. I am your partner and, uh, I was not consulted in the making of this decision. Silent partner. Oh, yes, well, after all that we've been through, you're gonna play hard to get with me now? Shush. Merry Christmas, Jack. Merry Christmas, Amy. ♪♪
