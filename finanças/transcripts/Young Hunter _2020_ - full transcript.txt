Cool pictures. Where is it? It's the South. The Southern lakes. My dad takes them, as a hobby, just for fun. Would you like a soda? Sure. Awesome! Are they over there? No. They are in Europe now. Every two years they go there for a month. Haven't you got any siblings? I have a little sister. Sofia. She's six. She's with them now. So they just didn't take you? Right. That's one of the advantages of being born later. When I was a kid they didn't go anywhere, and now they take her everywhere, of course. No, mom, I'm at Ezequiel's. He's a friend of Martin. He gave him the summaries, so I'll take them and go home. But I'll go in a while, because he has a pool, so... Pool! I'll stay in the pool for a while and then go home, OK? I'll text you later, I guess it'll be in the afternoon. Kisses. Years ago you had to look for stuff in magazines, like slyly. Now everything's on your phone. I remember once my mom caught me watching porn... ...gross. You see? These are the tits I like. With pointing nipples. They remind of the girl in that movie, where she was kidnapped, and the husband was... ...the one of Batman vs Superman. I can't remember the name of the movie. Dude, I have such a boner! Don't you get hard? Not this way, here. I don't know. How about we jerk off? Actually... I'd rather not. I'm not into that. I don't like boys. I'm sorry if I did something to... whatever, I don't know. I'd better go, right? I'm ready. Will you open the door? OK. Young Hunter Zeno of Elea devoted his life, his work, to study motion. He stated that motion was nothing but a illusion. And he supported it through paradoxes, this is the most famous one, the paradox of the race between Achilles, the fast, agile warrior, and a tortoise. He said that if Achilles allowed the tortoise a head start of about 100 meters... Do you like it? It's for the girls. Are you fag? No. Then don't peep so much, dude. 41, 42, 43, 44, 45. 46, 47, 48, 49, 50. Let's change! Martin... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, Got a cigarette? How old are you? 14. 14? I'll be 14 soon. I'll give you one, but you're to young to smoke. Got a light? Thanks. Cheeky kid! This is where I take the train. OK. Do you have WhatsApp? Of course. Tell me, so I'll send you that T-shirt stuff I told you. Or just add my contact. What is it? 114149 2530. "Mono" (monkey). Done. Some boner you got, dude! My place is out of the question. My folks are there. Do you want to come to my place? Isn't anybody there? Sure, then. Have you already been with many boys? This year was my first time... in Brazil. I was there, on vacation with my parents, and one of the boys I played soccer with took me to his place. We looked at some porn magazines, we ended up jerking off, fucking... actually sucking dicks and stuff. He was around 18. But we didn't talk at all. We never talked about it again. I didn't tell him I'd never been with a guy before. Besides, I was leaving in a few days, and he was all day long with a boy... some kind of boyfriend he had. He didn't really like me. So that was it. And was he the only one? No, there was another one. He works at some skaters place in Palermo. He's a little bit older than you. But he had a girlfriend and at some point he said... he was more in love with her. He taught me everything. You don't have a girlfriend, do you? I did last year, but... I've know I like boys since I was 13. I jerk off thinking of guys and stuff. Yes, me too. Since I was 13, 14... Let's go buy beer and chips. I have money. OK. We can order some pizza later if you want. OK. Got one? Is everything OK? Cool. How long will you be alone? My parents will be back in two weeks. Anyway, my aunt comes every three days. She helps me clean, I'm a mess. She brings me food, she helps me. Sometimes we eat together or have some "mate". Everyday around 9 she calls to check if I need anything. She's cool. She's not that old. She's around 35. I think I'm leaving. It's getting late. OK. I'll show you out. Positions... Again... Ezequiel! It's freezing, dude! Yes, but in a couple of months it'll be warmer. My cousin has one, but it's heated. So it's easier. It'll get warmer, it'll get warmer. - What's that? - What? Stop! You ass! I didn't enjoy the movie that much. I don't know... Why? Because the 3D glasses make me dizzy. It's a shame because I took them off... and couldn't read the subtitles properly I don't know... It may not be the movie... but I would have chosen another one. That's the magic of the 3D. When the guy falls down you feel like you are falling down. Yeah, right. I don't know... I don't know... I didn't like it. I told you! Next time, you choose the movie. Don't get angry, it's not that serious. I'm not angry, dude. Let's go. What's up? Is everything fine? Get in the back. Is he the son of your mother's or father's brother? He's not my cousin, like real cousin. He's like a second cousin, but we just say we're cousins to make it easier. His father is one of my mom's cousins there, in Parana. I used to stay at this uncle's house when I was a kid. - So whose house is this? - It's his. He lives here, in the city. I don't know what he does for a living... but he's doing well... and he bought this house to spend the weekends here. - I'll go to the bathroom. - OK. Thanks. Here's some salad. Just a minute. OK. You slept like a log. Yes. I think I got it all wrong when I came in. What did you think? I don't know... "Chino" has a girlfriend downtown he was telling me some stuff, showing me some photos. In fact, he'll stay at his girlfriend today. He'll stay the night, so... we'll be alone. Were you afraid of him to notice? Didn't he? Didn't he ask anything? What should he notice? You're my friend, dude. I came with a friend. All's fine. And you say he won't stay because of this girlfriend? Sure! I had already told you before we came. Remember? He'll sleep there and we'll be alone here until noon. Cool. You washed the dishes! Way to go! It's a miracle! I'm leaving. Remember to lock this one and the one by the yard. I'll leave the gate open, be careful, someone can sneak in if you don't lock. OK. I'm telling you because you're a bit dumb. You be careful too, because he forgets. And lock the front door. Don't lose the key, it's the only one I have. I know, dude, you keep repeating the same! I keep telling it because you're pretty dumb. You too. Deal with it. OK. You boys behave. I'll be back tomorrow, we'll have lunch together. OK. Shall we go buy some chocolates? Are there any shops open? Yes, there's a store 5 blocks away. Let's go. OK. Let me go to the bathroom first. It's strange you don't have a pet with all that space... Yes, it's weird. But now I really want to have a ferret. They are super cute! My friend has one and... he plays. But my dad doesn't like the idea. It's a bit strange. Close the door. Is everything fine? All's cool. Are you sure that Chino is not coming? Wait. I'll lock up. Dude! You scared the shit out of me! Why? - I thought something was wrong. - It was me. What are you doing like this? Aren't you cold? - Yes. - Let's go inside. - Do you want to see a movie? - OK. Do you play soccer? Yes, sometimes I do. Are you any good? I play. Let's say I survive. - And do you go to the stadium? - Yes, I do. Do you go often? Not that much. I go... pretty often. And what's wrong with you? - About what? - What's wrong with you? Nothing. Then change that, jerk. I don't have ice, do you want ice? - I'll go get some. - Yes. Are you OK? I'm fine. That's it. Well done! Did you like the present? Of course! It's cool. Are you sure? It's super cute. We saw it and dad thought you'd like it. Well... I'll go check on dad, he's cooking dinner. See you on Wednesday? There's much confusion about what the moonlight is, what's the source of its shadow or where its light comes from. It seems simple, but it's actually not. In fact, a lot o people have the wrong idea or just don't get it. You see the moon at night. Can anyone tell me where the sun is, just by looking at it? Ezequiel? By its shadow. If it's full, I can assume it's behind us, and if it's a half moon, it's on the side that receive the light. Good. And does the shadow have anything to do with the earth? No. Not at all. The moon is floating, and it's black where the sun can't reach it. And the shadow we see depends on our location regarding the sun. Great! Would you like to come and draw it? Yes, but can I go to the bathroom first? OK. Go. Does anyone who understood it want to come draw it? We'll have dinner at grandma's tonight, and tomorrow we're going to Rosario, your aunt invited us. We'll be back on Sunday. Two days with the family won't hurt you. Come with us! See you on Wednesday? Is everything OK? - How much would you say? - I'd say around 1.40... 1.40! - She grows up too fast! - Half a centimeter. Last month she was 1.39... It's too fast! The sneakers are new. I bought them because nothing fits her anymore. What's up, Eze? I checked the billboard, the movie is showing at 8 and at 10. Tell me which one suits you, and what time do you arrive from Rosario? Hi... There on the right is the next curve. Watch the back! You had to cover me, asshole! Do you have bandages? - I'll kill them! - Run! Run, fuck! There! Hi Ezequiel. There, when they come you turn left. I'll cover you on the right. - Who are you? - Watch this, do it alone. - Chino? - The one and only. - What's up? - Shall we meet? This thing we're gonna do... I'll blur your face, so no one can tell it's you. Don't worry. They'll see the little boy and you dick, but not your face. And how can I be sure you'll delete all you recorded that day at your place with Mono? What do you mean? How can I be sure you'll delete them? You trust. And what about Mono? What about him? I pay him. But he's no longer good for this, he's too old. Little boys are scared of him, he's no longer good. I'll ask you, one or two kids, and that's all. I won't bother you anymore. I want to see him. You fell in love? No. You're an ass, you fell in love. Forget it, he's not gonna see you. Besides, he's got a girlfriend, did you know that? He does. What if they find those videos? If you go to jail and they find those videos... Nothing happens. Nothing happens to you. They are underaged. Besides it's clear that neither of you know someone is filming. You did no wrong. Who buys them? Private buyers. But it all goes to USA, Europe... It's really hard to track them, you won't find those videos online, they are in the dark web, do you know what that is? Yes. Yes, I inquired, but I didn't want to enter. I got scared. I searched everywhere but couldn't find anything, not your house, neither Mono's face, nothing. It's impossible. Too many videos, too many sites. It's impossible, did you see? That's all encrypted, you can't find it just googling like any porn. It's impossible. Did you jerk off with my video? Who do you think you are, kid? Did it turn you on? Wouldn't you rather fuck with me? I'll turn over there. I can leave you by the corner, so you take the bus. Does it work for you? Yes. Uh! Juancito, come. Here, give this money to grandma. If I'm not back in ½ an hour tell Sergio to close. Hey, Sergio, got a cigarette? You scared me! Yes, take it from my clothes. Has grandpa left? If he sees I'm giving you cigarettes he'll kill me. So, how's school going? Do you like it? Yes. Are you a good student? I get good grades. Any girlfriend? No. No little schoolmate? None? Anyway, I'm no one to talk. I was so tiny when I was a kid, such a little bug compared to my schoolmates. A couple of years later I grew up suddenly and started to chase every girl in the hood. - Hey! - Hi. - All good? - All good. What are you doing? I'm playing. Bummer. You changed the earring, I like it! I bought it last week. Will you come to my birthday? - Yes. - You know which day it is, right? No, I don't remember. - Caro has a crush on you. - Yes. I know. - Don't you like her? - I don't know. She's pretty. OK. I'll see you later. ...there, but I'm not that good at it. When I was a kid, my grandpa taught me this way. You make two knots and end it like this. - That's it. - Yes, kind of. My grandpa can be a pain in the ass when I get home late, so I'd better to leave. OK. Wait! - Do you want my WhatsApp? - OK. - Tell me. - 11... 3. See you later. OK. See you. Bye! Hi! How are you? Nice to meet you. I wanted to know about the training... And what about your parents? You mean how did it happen? I don't remember much, I was just a kid. My uncle, my aunt and cousins were in a car, my parents and I were in another one. I kept bugging them about changing to the other car, because I was bored. So we eventually stopped at a gas station, and they allowed me go to the other car. We got in the car and... half an hour later it happened. That's crazy... you could have been there. Yes. Were you all going together on vacation? No. We were coming back from Uruguay. What the fuck, man? Let me see. Don't you want me to check your hand? Wanna come to my place? Relax. There's no on here. My brother comes late. How about meeting on the weekend? Do you know how to go back from here? I'll take the bus. Which one? The 85. The bus stop is 3 blocks from here. The one that goes in that direction stops by the corner, and the other one stops 2 blocks from there. Here's my real number. The other one... Call me or text me, if you want, so I have yours. OK. So... It's great that you stay at Martin's, I don't have a problem with that, but text me Ezequiel, even if it's late, Because I don't know where you are. You came back really late last night. It's OK, but neither Dario nor Martin knew where you were. Your battery was dead and I got worried. There are boundaries. OK. I'm sorry. It's OK if you want to wander around, but I'd like to know where you are. And if some day you have a girlfriend, I'd prefer you to come here with her instead of being who knows where. OK, I get it. I was with some guys at the square and I spaced out. Boys! We're going to the wedding. Did you text your mom letting her know you'll sleep here? In a minute. Leave some pudding for grandpa. Why do you have so many clocks? My grandpa was a clockmaker. When I was a kid I asked my dad if I could have them, of course he gave them to me so I collect them. I spaced out with those things. When I was younger I collected... my grandpa brought me bills from abroad, so... I started my collection, I asked everyone who traveled to bring me some, but then I lost interest. I hardly keep track of those things. This is what we'll do, when I text you you'll both go to the store. Then I'll send you another text, and you come back. Then you go to my room to fool around, you can lock the kitchen door, in case he asks you if I'm coming back or something. End of story. And think about it, if you do a nice job... for each kid you bring you'll get around a month of your dad's salary. Did you fuck with Mono the day we came? I'm not into boys. It's just a job. You see? OK? And what's with you and Mono? Nothing. Nothing. OK. Is everything OK, Zeze? Yes. Did you want to tell me something? No. Anyway... my cousin always has beer, we can have some, we watch a movie, just have some fun... Super cool! What did you tell your grandpa? Just that I was going with you to a county house. My grandma wanted to call your mom but I told her she wasn't going. That it was OK. She'll call me when I get there. I always do what I want, anyway. Come in. Are you staying for dinner, Juan? Yes. Can he stay for the night too, mom? Yes, of course. - Can we call his grandma? - OK. - And can he come to Rosario, too? - Yes. - Do you want to come? - OK. Rosario? Let them talk today, we'll use your cell, once it's all set I'll tell her we don't go. She's assume your grandma knows. Besides she won't have her number. I don't know... your mom is here. She always knocks. Are you sure she knocks? I'll lock. Here. I brought you this. Don't open it now. Do it later. What is it? It's just a present. Saturday, then? Yes. Ten o'clock at the square. Mom says that if your friend is not coming you could help cleaning the pool, she's started to drain it. Not this weekend, dad. I can't. Juan's grandpa invited us to La Plata to see... whatever. So we'll probably stay there the whole weekend. I think we will come back on Sunday. OK. No problem. It was my dad's. I'm going to bed. I have an early start tomorrow. OK. Eze... are you OK? Yes. Dad! I need to talk to you.
