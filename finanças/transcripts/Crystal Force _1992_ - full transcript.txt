[music playing] There is a force fearsomely formed, not unknown to those on the path to darkness, at which hell is a playground. It is poised to spring through the five-corner door of death, the pentacle. Behind this door, it prepares itself in the void called the dark appetite. Patient, it awaits its summoning by the funereal wails of grievers. It strikes at a time of grief and mourning, as if to mock death and any hope of a hereafter. [music playing] As the Lord giveth life, so he taketh it away. But the love we create with the soul granted us shall live forever. Sanctifying that which is eternal is what we do here today. We honor Howard Hunter, and say our goodbyes to this devoted husband and beloved father. And we must remember that death shall have no dominion. No! No, don't take him away from me! [wailing and screaming] I'll take you back home now. No, Jack, we're gonna walk. Looks like there's a storm coming. It's OK. Really. [music playing] The Reverend gave that same graveside speech a few years ago when my stepfather died. Oh, I know. They all say the same thing, like they're forced to memorize it in God's school, or wherever it is they learned to do burials. Do burials? Yeah, like they do weddings. I think what you mean to say is the Reverend conducts funerals. Did you take speech classes at that beauty school you're so proud of graduating from? What's wrong with you? Is my daughter being a wise ass? She's just a kid. Don't make excuses for her. Oh, Millie, don't be too hard on her. Some people just don't know how to react to-- To death? Good guess. Let's have some coffee. Excuse me. So you're gonna close the shop up for a while, aren't you? Oh, a couple of days. But you know if I'm not working, I'll probably go crazy. Why don't you and your mother take a couple of weeks off? Why don't you go somewhere? Jack, listen, our lives are here. And besides, I don't-- I don't want to be away from you for a minute. OK, baby. Whatever you need, Beth, I'm here for you. Whatever you need. And if you don't come to me, I'll come to you. And I won't take no for an answer. Can you give me one good why I shouldn't seduce Jack? Because it isn't right. Especially now. Doesn't that mean anything to you? Oh, sure. But now, Christ, the girl's father just died. Don't you think your timing is just a bit off? No. The timing's perfect. She's going to be a real drag to be with, and Jack's going to be dying for it before Beth ever even feels like doing it again. That's when it's Lurlene's showtime. You really are evil, aren't you? No, just a girl who knows what she wants, and when and how to get it. Even if I may really only want to do it with him once. Maybe twice. And you think it's worth it, just for getting laid? Provided he buys into your charms to start with. Oh, he'll be charmed, all right. And no one except you, me and Jack would ever know. He's certainly not going to say anything, is he? Would you, if you were him? I won't admit to knowing anything about it. I won't even admit to knowing you. But you do. And he's going to. Or I'll be damned. You know, I'm going to be checking on you. Your friends are not gonna let you hide. Oh, thank you, Millie. I'd like to stop by tomorrow night, if that's OK with you. Yes. I would like that very much. You know, Val, what gets me the most is that Dad won't be there at the wedding to give me away. My dad never made it that far, either. He died somewhere between my sweet 16 party and my high school graduation. Hey. What about your wedding, anyway, huh? What about it? I don't know. What about Jack? Is he nervous? Jack's not nervous. I'm nervous. It's me who's nervous. Will you take this? Sure. I'm just shaking. Now, um, even though Daddy and I had our problems, I just never thought that I'd miss him like this. I think your biggest problem is that you probably loved him too much. Honey, don't worry. Jack's there for you. He's gonna help you through all of this. [knocking on door] Val, why don't you go home and get some rest? I'll take over now. Hope's finally cried herself to sleep downstairs on the couch, so be quiet on your way out. Thanks. [knocking on door] Hi. Hi. I thought I could get the two of you to come over for a while. It's been a couple of days now. Yeah, well, let's go talk to Mom and see how she feels. Mom? Val's here to see us. Val wants to take us out. I don't know where. Where do you want to take us? Anywhere. Lunch, or a movie, or shopping? Whatever. It doesn't matter. Just out. I don't think so, sweetheart. I'm not quite ready to see anybody just yet. She doesn't want me to go. Oh, no, of course not. Please, Beth, you go with her. I just want to be alone for a couple of hours. Honey, you go with her. I'm asking you to. I don't want to leave you here by yourself. Beth, I know you mean well. I just want to be alone for a couple of hours. I want you to go. Mom, are you sure? I'm sure. OK. You know, I've always loved this store, but I never bought anything. It's too expensive. Rumor has it some strange guy bought this place. They say he'll give you a bargain if he likes you. Yeah? This is a really weird place. I think it's wonderful. What's weird is that no one seems to be minding the store. Let's leave. Leave? Empty-handed? I won't hear of it. In fact, nothing's tagged. Everything's negotiable. In fact, I've been known to give the unsuspecting shopper the bargain of a lifetime. What's this? A bag of tricks? A bag of answers. They're called runes. You ask a question, then select some tiles at random. These symbols supply the answers. Well I have a lot of questions, but I can't read in hieroglyphics. Beth? Take a look at this. [music playing] It's captivating. Mhm. Captor or captive, which is which? Crystals radiate and reflect. Attract and repel. There are some who say they hold secrets only time will tell. It's warm. Warm with the light that's burning within it. Did you know that man and crystal are related? Both 80% silicon, hard-pressed and mysterious. You just have to have it, right? Well, go ahead and make yourself happy. Buy it. How much? $50. 50? Sold. Beth, you're supposed to bargain with him. That's OK. This was meant for you. $25. Who said anything about not depending upon the kindness of a stranger? Well, thank you very much, kind stranger. Do you take milk? Oh, no. I'm so happy you're staying here with Beth. Well it's-- it's very comforting being here, although it's a little strange living at my daughter's. I just hope I don't become too dependent on her. Reverend, I'm too young to have this sort of thing happen to me. You're bitter with the Lord. I'm not bitter, Reverend. And I'm not angry with God. I'm just angry at the injustice of death. Anger destroys. Now you must-- Good evening, Reverend Peters. Hi. Hi, Mom. What'd you buy? Well, I bought something for the house. Not that I needed anything new, but I figured the place could use a little cheering up. Well what is it? It is a crystal. I bought it on impulse. Impulse or credit? Would you like a cup of coffee? No, thanks. You know what they say about crystals is that they're actually a life form. It's very pretty. Thank you. [phone ringing] Oh, excuse me, I bet that's Jack. She's such an angel. What's wrong? I-- I don't know. Maybe I'm coming down with a-- I'll get you some aspirin. [screaming] Are you all right? Oh, oh no. Are you having a heart attack? No, it's not my-- heart-- it's-- I don't know. I felt like I was in the grip of something. I can't explain it. Should we call the doctor, Mom? I don't know. No, I-- I just want to go home. Tonight I'll-- I'll put myself in the Lord's hands. And if I don't feel better tomorrow, I'll put myself in a doctor's hands, I promise. Goodnight, Reverend. God bless you. [music playing] Not so hungry today, boys, are we? Not fresh enough for you? Had to dig too deep? Just you wait for Christmas. I planned a Christmas dinner for you. A real treat. I'll serve you platters filled with flying reindeer meat. [cackling] [ominous music playing] [weeping] [weeping louder] [screaming] Yeah, things can get strange at night. With Beth, it's a dream. With me, I remember when my husband died, I was afraid the quiet was going to scare me half to death. You were afraid you'd be scared? Oh, you know what she means. The point is, I wouldn't allow myself to be afraid, even though I had good reason. It-- it never got completely quiet. It's a good thing my mother's not here to hear this. I'd hear mice in the attic or a tree branch scraping the roof in the wind. Oh and sometimes, when the refrigerator would turn off, it made this creaking noise. Sounded just like Ed's snores. Really. But it-- it wasn't scary. It was familiar. No, it was crazy-making. Maybe I dreamed it all up. Damn. Oh I'm sorry, I'm sorry. What do we have, a bloodbath special going here or what? It's all right. Don't worry about it. It's just a little blood. Even if it is my blood. You guys just love rituals. -Hey, Beth. -Hey, Veronica. Beth. Can you give me a quick comb out? Sure can. Hey, Veronica. Oh hey, Von. Looks nice. Thanks. Thanks very much, Beth. I'll see you next week. OK. Bye. Bye. Great-looking crystal. Beth bought it at the antique shop. It's beautiful, isn't it? Oh, it's gorgeous. I felt like I needed a little something. You know, we've all been under so much stress lately. To say the least. Well why don't I try a little magic to lift your spirits? Save it for the men in your life, dear. What's the magic, Veronica? Booze? I don't drink booze. Only distilled spirits. But you're right. No real magic. Not with men, God knows, or otherwise. Actually, I do fool around with trying to stay in touch with the mysterious. No, seriously. What do you do? Magic tricks? Parlor tricks? Cheap tricks? Cheap tricks? I can make contact, however indirect, with the spirit world. I happen to be a direct descendant of a strange and paranormal type. So that explains you. I always though you were just a talented bullshitter. No bull. My grandmother used to read palms. Her and my grandfather, they had this little fortune-telling place on the boardwalk in Coney Island. Back in the '50s. No kidding. No. Would somebody with gypsy blood running through their varicose veins kids? I'm serious. Grandma Olga could people about themselves just by feeling the bumps on their head. She could tell you whether you were going to have a happy life or a miserable one just by the way you signed your name. Graphology. Graphology, numerology, astrology. She was into everything. My mother claims that she taught Nancy Reagan's astrologer everything she knows. Is this grandmother of yours still alive? No. But do you want to hear something really weird? What? She was born on Halloween. And then she died on the sixth day of the sixth month in 1966. Did she teach you stuff? Well I picked up some stuff from her because she used to babysit me a lot, you know? When other kids were learning how to play Casino or Fish, I was given tarot cards to play with. You really believe she was a gypsy? I don't think so. I think it was just part of an act. But maybe not. You know, she was from Eastern Europe. Maybe She was a witch. She used to love to watch Bewitched on TV. No, but seriously, she did watch a lot of witchcraft movies on TV with me when I was little. And she'd root for the witches, of course. Now admit it, Veronica. You're just putting on an act, too. Am not. Let's call her bluff. Read my palm. You got laid last night. I did? Oh, no, you didn't. But you do dye your hair. I do that. And you do your own nails, and your boyfriend does the rest of you. What boyfriend? You're right, I haven't been laid in months. Oh, come on, what about her future? Yeah. Well, sorry, I can't do any more of this now. I've got to run. Wait a minute. I've got an idea. What about night? What if I called up a bunch of people and everybody came over and we could make fun and games out of it? I love it. I could live without it. Come on, you guys. It would take my mom's mind off of things. OK. Tonight. About, say, 8:30. Great. Yeah. Yeah, Jack, a seance. Well I don't know if it's a good idea or not. Look, I'm not asking you to participate. I know you have to work. So you'll come over after work? OK. I love you too. Bye. Jack isn't sure we should be getting involved in a seance now. Although I don't know why not. Mom, have you ever dabbled in the occult? No, not really. [doorbell ringing] I'll get it. You ready to work your magic? Ready to enter the world of escape. That's just what we all need. Can I go set up now? Set up? Oh, yeah, you're guru for the night. Veronica, by the way, I want you to lie to my mother in the end just to make her happy. I don't care what you say, just make it happen. Please make it good. You got it. [doorbell ringing] Hi, Beth. How's your mother? Oh, she's doing good, Mrs. Rogers. Is Veronica here? Yeah, she's setting up in the dining room. How you doing? Doing better. Hi. How are ya? Good. I'm looking forward to this. It's gonna be fun. You think so? Yeah. Hi, Beth. Can you believe we're doing this? Yeah. This better be good. It will be. Are you ready for your bedtime stories, my babies? There was once a time before the dawn of history when time did not matter. There was nothing to be born, nothing to die, no reason for time to go by. And the master spirit, the most powerful force of all, so fearsomely formed, was called the first one. OK, future seekers of America. Are you ready? We're ready. -Ready. -Yeah. OK. Let's go. Well let me see a show of hands. Good, because I'm going to need one of them from each of you later. Veronica, you did palms this afternoon. I thought you were going to do something different tonight. Like tea leaves. Like mice droppings. Yeah, I read somewhere people read them like tea leaves. -Oh, come on. -Yeah. She's right. People do read them. And they always spell shit. I have something different. I brought some other things. Cards. Tarot cards. No, not tarot cards. These are cartouche cards. Egyptian magic. The kind that, uh, Cleopatra used to use on her lovers, right? She didn't use magic. She used sex. Sex, magic, it's all the same. Anyway. These cards are just for telling the future. You can't use them on somebody else the way you mean. What else you got there? Runes, Viking fortune telling. These little symbols on the runes, you play a little game with them and then you look them up in the book and you know what's in your future. We've seen those before, Beth. Mhm. The precursor was born out of blackness before there was light. He created God, who created heaven and earth. He created the devil, who then made his hell. And the precursor created for them an ageless battle for the control of both saints and sinners. But there proved to be neither triumph nor loss, and the precursor grew impatient with the battle. And so said his emissary, creating for him a pentacle whose threshold he would cross. Now we have our choice. We can see what the Vikings want to tell us about our future, what the Egyptians want to tell us, and what with gypsies want to tell us. So who's first? Me. For you, I have something special. Pulse channeling. What the hell is pulse channeling? It sounds like something that has to do with blood pressure. Like when mine goes up when I see Billy Idol on MTV. You watch MTV? Just Billy. Oh, and David Lee Roth, too. All the rest of them, I could leave. They are cute-looking boys, aren't they? All right, Michelle. Don't quit after just two. You should check out the ass on-- Shut it, Lurlene. OK. Let's get on with this. All right. Now you get a chance to ask three questions, and I'll give you three answers. The pulse from your wrists, from your throat, and from your temples. OK? Uh-huh. Now I'll start to talk real fast after you ask me the question. It'll be my voice, but it really will be answering your question. OK? I get it. Touch-Tone telepathy. No fooling. You know it may not be scientific, but it does work. Hm, what's science got to do with it. Let her finish. I want to hear this. All right, you get three questions and three answers. Ready? Mhm. Just don't ask out loud. Solo, water. Did you think you were trying to blow out birthday candles? Well, did I-- did I answer the question? You might have. I asked about my vacation. I answered it. You'll go overseas to an island, a cruise. That sounds great. Except I don't like the solo part. I hate traveling alone. What I want to know is why did it take you so long to ask that question? Well, I-- I kind of had to explain why I was going to take a vacation again so soon. You guys all know I went to Las Vegas last month. I just can't stand staying home alone. You thought you had to explain that to us? No, I-- I was just trying to rationalize it to myself. Oh. That's normal. K. Hey, you'd better skip her ahead and throw it, it'll take all night. Well I don't have any more questions for the spirits, Your Honor. Your High Priestess. Beth, you ready? It's your turn. Give me your palm. You're shaking. It comes with age. It comes with stress. Well I won't be able to read your palm. we'll do something else. If I tried to read your palm, I'd be stuttering. Let's try the cards. OK. I'm going to put down three cards, and you turn one over. Well, what's the problem? What does it mean? Well, it just reflects bad times. But everyone picks this card every time. It's just that everybody has bad times in their life. Right. You don't have to patronize me. Forget the cards, we'll do something else. The crystal. Let's have a seance. Oh come, let's all join hands. OK. All join hands. Close your eyes. Concentrate. We're calling up the spirits. [ominous music] Hi. What was that? What the hell was that? I saw it. I saw it my mind. It was an angel-- Oh, sure you did. And Veronica we can bet can pull a rabbit out of a hat, too. That was no trick. Not all of it. It wasn't? No, it wasn't. Oh, sure. And what about the voices? The voices were no trick either. Well trick or no trick, it was amazing. Look, you guys, I hope you don't mind, but I'd like to call it a night. I've got to be up early for work, right? Right. There's coffee in the kitchen. Look. I know it was probably my imagination, but I felt Howard trying to contact me tonight. I felt his presence in the room. It was very strong and powerful, like he was trying to reassure me that he was still around. It's kind of spooky, isn't it? Mom, you're saying this like you mean it, like you believe it. I felt it, that's all. Come on, Mrs. Hunter. Listen. Do you girls think we could possibly do this again tomorrow night? I'm game. Well if you really want me to call Veronica, I will. I do. Well, let's try it again sometime. Goodnight, you two. Goodnight. I'm going to see Jack. Oh damn it. I must have left my pocketbook in the house. Be a decent kid, will you, Lurlene, and go get it for me? OK. I'll be right back. [ominous music] What is keeping her? We've got to get home. [distant screaming] Oh my God. Oh my God. [cackling] Help. Get out. We have to get the hell out of here. What are you screaming about? What's going on with you? Get out of here. Who was it you saw? Something evil, a demon, it looked right at me with-- Listen, Lurlene. You've got to show me where you saw this thing. Are you crazy? I'm not going back in there. I'll go check it out. [ominous music playing] I always thought that girl was a little unbalanced. [sobbing] What did you find? Nothing. No boogeymen, no scary ghosts. Nothing. I don't care what you say, I know what I saw. Look, I'm bleeding. I swear. I swear, I know I was. We're not staying here any longer, Mom. Let's go. Slow down, Lurlene. Listen, we've got to get the hell out of here. Let's go. [ominous music playing] [moaning] Beth, what's the matter, are you all right? I'm-- I'm having a-- a dream. Just a dream. [eerie music playing] See the shape fiercely formed, be it amphibian or reptilian, simian or sapian, with razor teeth, tusks, talons, or claws. In feathers or furs, dressed in scales or dragon skin, it comes creeping, slithering, bleating, hooting, hissing. [screaming] Good morning. You look like hell. You can't go in there. Why not? Because there's blood all over the floor. Dogs, vicious dogs, and the Reverend is on the floor with his skull cracked open. It's horrible. What are you talking about? The neighbor's dog? Wha-- what's his name? Sparky? God, Sparky must be really getting to you, huh? What'd he do, bark all night? It's not Sparky. Go on, show me. Come on. Beth, show me. I swear it. Beth, Beth, looks, there's nothing, OK? There's nothing here. It's all right. Look, I am telling you that there were dogs in here drinking blood. You must have had some nightmare. How could it have been a nightmare? I was awake. I got up this morning, I put on my clothes, I ate, I came to work. You were either sleepwalking in the middle of a nightmare or-- Or what? I don't know what. Let me tell you something, Lurlene. Whatever happened last night was planted there by Veronica. High priestess, my ass. And I say she's a witch. Oh-- That sure wasn't anything natural that attacked me last night. [ominous music playing] Good day, Reverend. You would have me believe that some monster materialized out of nowhere, couldn't resist your sex appeal, and went after your tits? I thought you were going to lighten up on the stupidity, or at least have a little respect for my intelligence and cut it out with this monster crap. You're the moron, Winnie. You're going back there tonight. I sure as hell am not going back there. You are so seductive, such a powerful center of attraction. So beautiful, just irresistible. Thanks for taking me. You really feel like you have to thank me? I'm just thankful to have you. You know you never have to question that. You look quite beautiful. [ominous music playing] Will I see you tonight? I don't know. Maybe for a few hours. I have a surveillance. I could make a phone call and go in late. Well that means that you'll get off later. So why don't you just go in when you're supposed to and I'll close the shop early? We've gotta spend some time alone. There's never enough time. I know how much time we're going to spend apart, even after we're married. Come on, Beth. Are we going to argue about my career again? Or are we going to, considering we haven't in a week, make love? OK. There's no argument. I'll see you at 5:00. Well screw you, Mom, and your ideas about me. What's the matter? Look, I'm not going back to that house again. I don't give a damn whether you believe I was attacked there or not. I wish you weren't such a liar. Where are you going? Hi, sweetheart. Hi. I hope I'm not being too selfish. It's just that I had to be alone with you, at least for a few hours, at last. Away from all those parlor games at your house. Yeah, I know. Don't you think I feel the same way? You're looking brighter, a little bit at least. Well that's because I'm with you. [ominous sounds] Everybody's been so crazy lately. Veronica's holding another seance at our house. Mm. I'm holding you like-- I need more than that. [music playing] [panting] [moaning] Why did I ever let you girls talk me into this silly stuff? Because if it's good enough for Shirley MacLaine, it's good enough for us. OK. Then maybe I can get Veronica to channel up my ex-lover, John Lennon. Ooh, maybe she can reach back for Clark Gable. You're better off asking for Laurel and Hardy. You guys ready? Let's go. Yeah. [knocking on door] Hello. Thanks for coming. Veronica's preparing herself for the seance. I bet. Please make yourself at home while we wait. Thanks. Are you going to be here when I get back? I get off around midnight. Mm. No. I'm gonna go back to my place. I want to lay down and relax. Should I expect you about, what, 12:30? 1 o'clock more like it. I have a big bust to make tonight, so there'll be a lot of paperwork. You know how Saturday nights are. Yeah. Well don't go looking for trouble. I know. It's your job. That's right. You look exhausted. Why don't you just stay here and get some rest? I should really get back. OK. I'll call you in a couple hours. Promise? I promise. The power is within me to bring forces from beyond. I swear by any which shall guide me. I shall sacrifice for silence any who may doubt them. The power is within me to bring forces from beyond. Beth, is that you? Not Cinderella. I'm really tired. I'm going to go upstairs and lay down. If you need anything, you can call me, Mom. Goodnight, honey. Goodnight, ladies. Goodnight, sweetheart. [suspenseful music playing] The candles light the path for the spirits to travel. The incense cleanses and purifies the air. The spirits draw their physical power from the crystal. All stand, please. Join hands and form a circle. The circle will let the spirits know that we are in accord with them. Everyone close your eyes. Be as quiet and still as possible so that I may center myself with the vibrations of the universe. [panting] [cackling] The dark force. Spirits. What are they saying? Shh. I don't hear anybody. They're gone. The talking frightened them away. I didn't hear anything. Excuse me, I've got to use the lady's room. I heard something. Me, too. I don't know what. Some people are more in tune with the spirit world than others. All be seated. I'll use the crystal to channel an individual spirit. [cackling] The spirit that I channel will answer all of your questions. [chanting] The channel is open. [chanting] The channel is now open. Do you see behind you? There's a pentacle. It is the easiest way for an entity to enter our world. [gagging] I feel the spirits coming. The spirits are coming. [screaming] I knew I shouldn't have come! It's the crystal. It's hot. Val, help. What do I do? [cackling] [screaming] [all screaming] There's a monster in the house! What's going on? [screaming] Bill, call for backup. You've gotta get out of the house. No, I'm scared. You have to hurry. Just go straight ahead. Run straight ahead. As fast as you can. Go. [siren wailing] You're here! There's a monster in the house! There's a monster in the house! My friends are in there! Please help me! [screaming] I can't move! Don't be afraid, everything's going to be all right. [gunshots] [cackling] [screaming] [sobbing] [screaming] It's the crystal. Are you here to see Beazle? What? Like anything you see? You scared me. That's not really my job. I'm here to help. Would you like to buy something? Yes, please, a present for my mother. Something shiny. Something more brilliant, more powerful than gold, shall your mother behold. All I got is $5. Well $5 will never do. This is priceless. But priceless means it's free to you. Free? A gift from me to you. And you give it to your mother. It will be a secret between us two. Gee, thanks. [cackling] Others will pay the price for my generosity. [piano music playing] [music playing]
