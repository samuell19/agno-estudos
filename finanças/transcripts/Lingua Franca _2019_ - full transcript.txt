[subway rattling] [cell phone vibrating] [groans softly] [phone continues vibrating] [party noises on phone] [Olivia] Hello, Ma? [mother] Hello, dear? [Olivia] Hello, Ma? Ma, why's it noisy where you are? [mother] I'm at a birthday party for Edna's granddaughter. That girl who was a sucker for dance contests... [Olivia] How's Edna? [mother] Still her cranky old self, hosting a game of mahjong! Sweetie, when are you sending my allowance? It's almost the 25th of the month. [Olivia] Maybe Wednesday. I'll text you. [mother] Thank you, dear. Stay safe. I dread watching the news about what's going on there. Ma, it's way too early. Let's talk later, okay? [sighs] [hangs up] [water faucet running] [water turns off] -[knocks] -I'm ready. You're ready for your tour? Here, put this on your head. -It's not a fashion show, come on. -[scoffs] We've got lamb, goat, beef, and veal here that we kill. I've got three coolers. This is where the lamb and the goats are. Alex! This is the beef cooler. Notice the hooks? They're about seven pounds each. Don't ever drop one on your foot, it will break it clean. -Julio, how's your wife doing? -Good. All right. The mass of these beasts of beef. Now... in this cooler, this is where we kill the animals for our private customers. This is a halal house, so each one gets a knife in the throat. Always a knife. They get skinned, washed, the stomach comes out, and they slide it in here. This is where you work. This is where all the accidents happen. You see that? You've got seven rails, three lines. When you push the animal down the line, always put the safety lock on. If you don't put it on, it's gonna fall off and knock your head open. [chuckles] Ugh. One second... [cell phone vibrating] Hello. When can I go home? You're home, Olga. Look behind you. Do you see the wallpaper? I'm looking. Is that not your wallpaper? Don't you remember picking out that wallpaper yourself when you first had your son Roman? Yes, yes, I remember it. I picked this wallpaper out. [Olivia] Now look at the stove. Isn't that the stove you cooked borscht in for your children when they were younger? Yes, I did. Yes. You're home, Olga. Do you see that now? Yes. [line hangs up] [line beeping] So, uh, where were you again? -Ohio. -[Murray] Oh, yeah? How was that? It was big. Quiet. -I was on a farm, mostly. -You liked it? -It was okay. -When did you get back? Three hours ago. Let me be very clear with you. You're not here 'cause I'm looking for a new hire. I'm doing your mother a favor. So I'm gonna hire you on a probationary basis only. Every guy that works here, they work their asses off. You understand me? Damn it. That won't work. [Olivia] Can I help? This is too much work. It's just going to get easier once we get started. But I'm tired now. I know, but your grandson Alex is coming back home today, and I'm sure he would want to see you. The whole family will be there at dinner. Imagine what Alex will think if he doesn't see you there. But... But he comes here after, right? Yes, that's true, but you also haven't seen Alex in almost a year. Do you want to make him wait a few more hours? I promise, if you wear a nice dress, you're going to look more beautiful than Elizabeth Taylor. No! You think so? Olga, do you need my help in getting dressed? No, no, no, I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm good. It's good. Are you sure? Yes. I'm sure, yes. -Hi! -Hi! Here, let me take that from you. -You've got that, Ma? -Yeah. -Hello. -Hi. -How are you? -Hello. -Can you say "Hi, Uncle Alex"? -Remember me? -No? -[laughs] She's being a grump. -Hi! -Hi. So good to see you. -We missed you. -Thank you. It's good to be back. -How are you? How are things? -I'm good. Things are good. The auto repair shop is doing really well, keeping your brother busy. And, um, I quit my job at the salon. -Oh, you did? -Two months ago. -Oh, wow. Congrats. -To look after this lady. -Oh, yeah? -[Olga] Sasha? [Alex] Babushka! Oh! My beautiful boy! My boy, you look just like yourself. [chuckles] You get more handsome every time I see you. Aw, thank you. So, tell me... how many hearts did you break this trip? Ah. [chuckles] Only seven this time. -Seven? -Yeah, slow week. -[laughs] -You are here. -Where are you going to sit? -Right next to you. Good, good, good. -You have to push me in. -I will. Okay. Good. All right. -Here we go. -Okay? [laughs] You sit. Oh, look. Look. It's good to see you, Baba. It's good to see you, my darling. How did you get to be so grown up? That's not possible. -What grade are you in now? -Third. -[Olga] I think she's teaching. -I'm not teaching. Lucky you look like your mother. And it is a very special occasion, right? Babushka? How was work today? [in Russian] Good. [in English] Fine. It's my first day. Very nice of your uncle Maxim to get Alex work there. And I'm sure he'll do great. [man] As a butcher? Okay. You're going to be staying in what used to be your father's old bedroom at Babushka's. We had it fixed up and ready for you. [man] You sure you can handle that? [woman] The caregiver's still gonna be there. Alex will help look after Babushka, on his days off. That was the plan. The last time you trusted him with a family matter, he crashed your car into a bodega, high out of his mind and it cost us five grand to bail him out. [Olivia] But you don't do this anymore, remember? Why don't we go back upstairs and get you cleaned up? [Olga] I need this for Monday. I have a suggestion. Since Janusz is sick, the earlier you finish work, the better, so you can go home and look after him. So why don't I finish this work for you? But I... My name is Olga. [Olivia] So many people in your grandmother's condition can feel as though they're losing control. That feeling can be scary. It helps to know that certain daily events will always happen at a certain time. Just remember that the schedule is there to help you and not to control you. Is that your sister? That's just the other caregiver of Olga before you arrived. I'm not gonna remember all this, I don't think. Have you ever looked after your grandmother before? No. You don't have to give her a bath, if that's what you're thinking. She doesn't need that kind of help yet. Just wait for me to do it. And on my days off... and you're home here with her, if you're ever unsure about anything, you can always give me a call. Okay, I will be back later today. [sighs] All right? [chime sounds] Hello. Good afternoon. Name, please. Katrina Dela Fuente. K-A-T-R-I... Actually, can you give me a valid ID? It'll be easier. -Uh, is my Philippine passport okay? -Yes. Okay, so... the name in the passport is different. Yeah, about that, uh... Can she change it now and use the new one, since she and I are gonna get married? No. In her case she would have to do that through the country of citizenship. It's fine. That's complicated. Valid ID, sir? Ah. Baba, you sure you don't want me to help you? I'm fine! Okay, Baba. Have a seat. What? You don't want to sit down? Please, can you...? Oh, of course! Okay? Thank you. I may be old, but I'm smart as a whip. I didn't say anything. Yes, you did. You should eat. Come on, it's going to get cold. Baba, come on. I'll help you. Okay? Oh, shit, that's hot! [chuckles] Oh, really? Nice. You're gonna laugh at your grandson? [blowing] Sorry, girl, but I can't be of more help with your passport. My contact has stopped altering passports with all this immigration crackdown. I think they're scared. I tried to reason with them. I said my friend's been waiting for a month. They wouldn't budge. But this isn't me anymore. Neither my name nor my gender. To think I wouldn't have had to alter these... if they didn't go out of their way to pass that damn bill back home. It's so frustrating. Well, at least you're getting your green card soon. I still owe Matthew $5,000, but... If only I could get this green card now and stop worrying. Girl, why not just do what I did? First fall in love, then get married. Sis. And when do you suppose that'll happen? Fine, pay off your Matthew for that green card then! Good thing he's sort of cute. Well, if I'm working my ass off to buy a husband, -then he better be easy on the eyes. -Damn right. -Go on, get out of here. -But, sis, congrats. Oh, my gosh. Thanks, girl! [in English] For richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, until death do us part. I, Daniel Cutler, take thee, Katrina Dela Fuente, to be my lawfully wedded wife. To have and to hold, from this day forward, for better, for worse... -[laughter] -So... how's work? -When was the last time I saw you? -Fourth of July, so two months ago. Uh, well, I've got a part time server gig for these corporate events which is pretty cool. I can do my sculpture on the side. Let's, uh, everyone get together real quick. -Let's take some group pictures. -Oh, okay. -Hold that thought. -Oh. Okay. Okay. [photographer] One, two, three. One, two, three. There you go. -Let's do you two separate real quick. -Okay. [Olivia] Actually... before I forget. That's great. I want you to do a little pose right there. Oh, my God, it's our wedding photo! Right there. Now, uh... -One, two, three. -Can you do crazy? -Beautiful. -Now, your turn. -Can you get them? -Yeah, of course. Actually, can you use this Polaroid? Sis. Sis, come here. You're going to look beautiful in your photo album. -[in English] There we go. -Smile. On the count of three. One, two, three. [Olivia] By the power vested in me by the state of New York... I now pronounce you... husband... and wife. So you're allowed to have a drink? I won't tell mommy. Go fuck yourself. Get out. -All right, what do you have? -Jesus Christ, Andrei. I'm not drinking. Seriously? I'm not gonna have you watch me drink. Should we go? We're here, order a drink. -Shut up and get a drink. -All right. I'm gonna get a... boilermaker, Jack and a Bud. Damn, that sounds good. -What do you have, sir? -Uh, cranberry and club. Hey, wanna see a magic trick? -Hey, what the... -Ta-da! Give me that. Dick. Protect your shit, bro. Since when did you start drinking, uh, pink shit? I'm on the program, Andrei. Just order a beer. Even babies drink beer. -What babies? -High school kids. Hey! It's good to see you. Get off me, okay? -You missed me, that's what this is about. -Honestly, not so much, man. You being back means I need to stop fucking your mom now. She's really upset, she misses that small dick of yours. -She's like, "Is it in?" -Hi. -That looks good. What are you drinking? -[Alex] Special recipe. Can I get a whiskey on the rocks? Know what, give me a shot of vodka. [Andrei] My man! -Thank you. -Hey. -[glasses clink] -Na zdoróv'je! [siren blares] Oh, fuck. Fuck. [sighs] Shit. Okay, Baba! It's time for your bath. Are you ready? Ugh. You smell like alcohol. Uh, yeah, sorry. Uh... -I'm gonna take you to the bathroom. Okay? -I don't feel like it. Maybe later. You gotta have a bath right now, that's what the schedule says. I need to get something to eat! Okay, cool. I'll make you something in the kitchen while you're in the bathroom. No, I don't need to take a bath right now. Let me help you to the bath. [screams] [Alex] What the fuck? Don't you ever grab me like that again. -Shit... [sighs] -Ah! No! No! -Baba, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. -No! -It's okay. -Stay away from me. -Don't you touch me. -Baba, I'm sorry. I don't care about sorry, not sorry. -Don't you touch me. -Let me help you to the bath. -No! -I'll just help you walk. Shit! [sobs] -It's okay... -Leave me alone. No! Take your fucking hands off of me! Get away from me! Don't you ever grab me like that. Please... Shit! Baba, I'm... I'm sorry. Baba, let me in. [Olga] I need something to eat, okay? Olga, this is Olivia. Are you all right in there? I said, I don't need a bath. Ugh. Did... Did she ask you to help her with a bath? No, I was just trying to give her a bath 'cause it's on the schedule. You remember what I told you? That if she needed that kind of help, you would let me know? -Do you remember when I told you that? -Yeah, fine, I fucked up. Olga, this is Olivia. You're going to be... okay, all right? I'm gonna... go in... and then we're gonna make you breakfast. -Want me to get some food? -Okay? I think it's best if I just take over from here. [vocalizing] [singing] Yes, Chad! Yeah! Yes, Chad! Harder! Girl, marry him already! [Olga in English] And when we came here, to the United States, he taught himself English right away. Then he wrote me a love letter. But I found out later, he copied it from a famous writer. Oh, he's such a clever cuss, my Janusz. [chuckles] He took me to ballet, on our first date. Here, have some more food. [Alex] Hi. -[Olga] Read this for us. -No, I stink. I'm gonna have a shower. [Olga] No! Read this here now. -I'll take this back to the kitchen. -No, you stay. [scoffs] [clears throat] "I cannot write a word without hearing, knowing how you pronounce it." [Olga] Ha. Go on. "You came into my life as one comes to a kingdom where all the rivers have been waiting for your reflection, all the roads for your steps." Baba, I don't think I should be reading this. [Olga] "I will cover you with love when next I see you." "I will cover you with love when I next see you. With caresses. With ecstasy."

I swear, after this fucking dance, the stripper's begging me to fuck her. I had to say no. -I fucking had to pass it up. -[man] Oh. Of course you did. Why? Didn't have a rubber. -[man laughs] -Man, gotta have them. I was with this one chick, and all this bitch ever wanted to do was blow me. -Wouldn't even let me see her pussy. -Damn, was she a fucking tranny? Whatever it was... [man] I don't fuck with strippers. They're dirty as fuck. -No! For fuck's... -Whoa! [man in Russian] Relax! What the fuck are you doing? You're acting like a child throwing shit around everywhere! [announcer on radio] In Phoenix, Donald Trump promised mass deportations, but did not explain how he would do it. [Trump] People will know that you can't just smuggle in, hunker down and wait to be legalized. [announcer] Undocumented immigrants must return to their home country and apply for re-entry, Trump said, vowing to subject new immigrants to ideological tests. [Trump] It's our right, as a sovereign nation, to choose immigrants that we think are the likeliest to thrive and flourish. [cell phone ringing] Hi, Matthew. [Matthew] Hey. How's everything? We can still meet on Friday, right? I... I can. But I feel like I should let you know, so that it doesn't come as a total shock when I see you Friday. What? What is it? I met someone. Like, over a month ago. And I've come to really like her these past few weeks. But her tourist visa is expiring, and I think I'm gonna help her out. Listen, I feel so bummed out doing this. But I'll return all your money when I see you Friday. I couldn't change his mind. I could ask around for you. I bet Thelma knows another guy or two from the restaurant. You never know, third time's the charm. Always the bridesmaid... Remember in sixth grade? When we tried being altar boys? When what we really wanted was to be nuns. Sister Mary Javina and Sister Mary Josefa. Remember that? And whenever I'd cry when the boys would tease me... you'd buy me a popsicle during recess.

Um, I speak two. I speak Tagalog, which is the national language. -Taga... Tagalog? -Tagalog. Tagalog? -Tagalog. -Tagalog. -Okay. -And... the language that I was raised to speak in is called Cebuano. I was born in this province called Cebu. -Cebu? -Cebu. C-e-b-u. Cebu? -Cebu. -Okay. So, how do you say... How do you say "man" in Tagalog? Lalake. Lalake? How do you say "beautiful"? Maganda.

I don't know. A year? Four months? A week? I could wake up in the morning, and they'll be parked outside waiting to arrest me. I'm just gonna check on Baba. It's late. You must be tired.

And why would the ICE agent bother wearing a ski mask, just to break into your house and take your things? Maybe Alex is mixing things up? Was he drunk? Is that why he can't recall? I don't know, Trixie. How many times do you think I should ask him? Well, why not ask him to marry you then? Ask him. But he's a good person. He's a good person.

We just started the payment arrangement. It might take another year, more or less. But don't worry about me. We'll make it eventually. [mutters]
