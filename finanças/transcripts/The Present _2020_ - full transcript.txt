Dad, come on, let’s go! Without a daughter or an alarm you’d never wake up, eh? Not true. Can’t a man have one day off? Right, Yasmine? Tell your mother. How was yesterday? You got home so late. How’s your back? Like always. -Happy anniversary! -You too, my love. Hopefully we’ll have a nice day. Go get ready, sweetheart. So you can go with your dad. Come on, you little rascal, get up! Get up. Breakfast is ready. Come on. Time to eat! Move it! Sit! Eat! Thanks, but I need to rush, so I can pick up your gift and get back in time to make you a delicious dinner. Really? And me… where’s my gift? I’ll put Yasmine to bed early. That’s your gift. What’s this? LEMONS, MINCED MEAT, MILK… So nice. You, my sweetheart, are just incredible! All right, say bye to Mom. Bye, my love, take care. God damn this thing. -What's your name? -Mohammed Nasrallah. All good, come on. Guys, let this elderly lady pass. Bless you. Please let them through. Take care. Sweetheart. Dad. You’re the only person in the world who still uses a watch. This watch was my father’s. It’s very special to me. Did you lose something, Dad? No, nothing… nothing. Give me your ID. Why are you here? This clown thinks he’s friends with Avi. You wait for me here until they finish. Not long and then we’ll get going. Okay? Mom. Please. Where’s the permit? Get a permit and you can pass. Please be kind. Look at the child. Where’s the permit? Bring the permit and let's go. Silence, go back. Come on, Yasmine. Come on, we need to move it. What… What happened? Oh no, sweetheart… Sorry, I’m so sorry. I didn’t notice. I’m really sorry, Dad, but I couldn’t hold it. My love, why didn’t you say something? It’s okay, Dad. There was nothing you could do. Okay, my love. It’s okay. No problem. We’ll fix it. Let’s go. We’ll figure it out. Gorgeous! A little princess. The most wonderful girl in Palestine. What’s this? We didn’t agree on this. Why is the pharmacy next door closed? They had a death in the family. I see. Do you have any medicine, painkillers? Anything? Panadol… yes… We had some, but we sold out. Hello! Welcome, welcome. -Who’s this cutie? -I’m Yasmine. Yusef Khalidi. I called last week about the fridge. Are you Raed? God forgive you! Raed is as skinny as a stick. I’m Amjad. Raed told me you’d be coming and set this one aside for your lady. And he said, if it doesn’t suit you, go ahead and select any other. But first, coffee or tea? No, thanks, we’re in a bit of a rush to get back. This one looks just fine. Raed said you could help with the delivery? The best delivery, of course! Coming up, just a minute. Thank you. Shall we decorate it with this? Nice. Bastards! Is there another route? No, this is the only way. If you lend me your trolley, I’ll get it out here. I swear I’ll return it to you. Yasmine! Where’s your jacket? I think I forgot it where we bought the fridge. Some birds flew away with your common sense. No problem, we’ll go back and get it another time. -My mother doesn't want that. -Why? Because she looks like an ape. Your mother is right, you idiot. What’s that stink? You’re all disgusting. Go! Go! Come on, love. Shlomo, come on, let him go. It doesn’t fit, it’s just a fridge. This is procedure. You know, procedure? Do you want to be responsible for this? It’s the only way through for Arabs. -Stop! -No, no! -Calm down. Now, get up! -Hey, hey, hey! -Where is she going? -Stop the girl! Come back here! Leave her, she’s just a girl. Leave him. -Don’t fight -Just wait! I’m going to report this. Wait and see! Move! Just you wait! Traitor! Asshole!
