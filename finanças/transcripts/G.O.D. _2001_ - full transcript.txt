>> Excuse me, you happen to have seen my wife? >> Not sure. What does she look like? >> Bright eyes, long hair, gorgeous. >> Not a clue. [soft music] [radio announcer] [dramatic intro music] [birds chirping] >> Your favorite breakfast. Can I help you with anything? >> No. It's a new shirt. >> It's a new job. >> Yeah, some kind of promotion. >> I don't want to hear you talking like that. >> How can I not? I'm going from police sergeant in my country to a security guard. I feel I've failed you. >> So who says you're gonna do it for ever? It's a new country, you've got to start somewhere, right? Isn't that right, Sergeant Stanton? >> Yes ma'am. I'll make you proud of me. >> Good. Now move it out. Lunch will be provided at twelve hundred hours. [dramatic music] >> Let's both have a nice day. >> You won't go too far. >> Let the real cops worry about it. [dramatic music] >> Don't do anything stupid. >> Ray! >> Ann, down! >> Aaaaaaaargh! Aaaaaaaargh! [gun firing] >> Ann, get down! [automatic weapon firing] >> Let's go! [gun firing] [automatic weapon firing] >> Get in! [gun firing] [tires screeching] >> Ann... Ann? Oh my God. Ann! Help! [dramatic music] [people talking] >> Is that your final decision? >> Absolutely. >> Very well. [dramatic music] I have to take your gun. I couldn't do anything. They'll keep the other branches staffed by us if we let you go. But, you can always depend on my referral. Take it. I'm sorry. [dramatic music] >> The dreams have come back clearer than ever. If I could only connect my head to a tape recorder, I'd play it back for them frame by frame and show the bastards you had nothing to do with it. I don't care about the job. I just don't want you feeling guilty up there, alone, thinking you sidetracked me for life. I'll be okay as long as there is a road, a package and a deadline and I get to work alone. I just hope I can finish paying for the van. [dramatic music] >> Look... I won't ask you for much anymore. I know you want out. But I can't miss a sale like that... and Wayne, he's drinking way too much to be trusted. So you make the delivery and you get a quarter. What do you say? >> You know, um... This last year's been the first time I've been able to walk around without having to watch my back. It feels good. >> What about your bills? You think of the money? Art school all paid for. What do you say? >> I gotta to do it on my own, brother. I'm sorry. >> Hey. What did you think of Linda's paintings? >> They're not bad for self-portraits. >> Say hi to momma. >> I will. [upbeat music] >> Lisa, you are just a dream come true. >> Wow! Could you tell my hands were shaking? >> I couldn't have, mine were shaking too. >> Yeah, the thrill of working with a big star. >> You do have beautiful eyes. Look, there's someone I want to call. Someone I think you should meet. [upbeat music] Adrian Kaminsky, art dealer. Lisa Belmont aspiring model. >> It's a pleasure. >> It's very nice to meet you too. How did you get over here so fast? >> Well... I have my gallery next door. That's how I know Nigel. >> Old friends? >> Actually he, photographs some of my works and I let him exhibit some of his. >> Sounds pretty self-sufficient. >> Mm-hmm. >> Why did he want me to meet you? Are you single? >> No. He wanted me to meet you because he knew I was looking for an assistant. >> How do you know I can do the job? >> Well, I don't. But Nigel told me that you were trying to get into business school. Sounds like brains and looks in one package. You see, I need that. So what do you say? >> I guess, I mean, I'll give it a try. >> Good. Let's have a toast! >> Here we go. Some lovely orange juice. >> To the future. >> To people who take chances. >> Sure.>> Hm-mmm. [electric guitar playing] [alarm clock beeping] >> This is Guaranteed Overnight Delivery. How may I help you? [saxophone playing] >> I got me a Polish. White skin, a little plump. Lots of meat to sink your teeth into. Or I got the Italian. Dark, thin, real hot stuff. Good size buns on both of them. Either way, you won't be sorry. >> Ah, Italian. I said it before, you're in the wrong business. >> I shoulda been an actor. >> Nope, a pimp. [laughing] >> Pimping's illegal. >> Yeah, so is slicing down the middle. [laughing] [saxophone playing] >> Stop! [dramatic music] Stop! [dramatic music] >> What the fuck are you, the local vigilante? You get the fuck out of my face and I won't put any holes into you. >> Pellet gun. >> Argh! Oh! >> Get up! Aha! What's this? You're lucky. Bullets on the other side, you would have been a dead man. >> I need my ID! [siren wailing] >> The wind must have taken some bills. >> Ah, the wind's name is Reggie. He only does that when he needs a fix. >> I have a feeling he's gonna drop the habit. [saxophone playing] [seagulls cawing] [piano playing] >> Uh-uh. Not in the gallery please. New art should not smell like old smoke. Adrian Kaminsky. >> Ray Stanton, G.O.D. I need this filled out please. >> Okay. How long have you been in this business, Mr. Stanton? >> Two years. >> Why do you concentrate on hazardous material and special items? >> Background in security. >> Okay. Do you carry a gun? >> Not anymore. >> Seems like a whole different field. How come? >> I wasn't very good at small talk in the boardroom. >> Anyway, Mr. Stanton, what you're picking up is not hazardous but it's definitely a special item. While things are packed in certain ways so they can take abuse during travel, but because of the insurance, they cannot be opened, except by, us, the shipping agent, or the client. Here's five hundred. You'll get the rest upon delivery. And Howard will be expecting you. >> Cash? >> Yeah, cash. >> Fragile, 150 pounds, I'll need a hand lifting it. >> Wayne. [piano playing] >> This is very urgent, Mr. Stanton, so no unnecessary stops and no other deliveries. That's why we are paying you the big bucks. >> Understood, sir. >> All right, good luck. >> Thanks. [truck engine starting] >> Well, should be there near five thirty. I would give him five and you keep the rest until I see you. Because I'm not gonna pay a delivery man as much as I would pay my brother, come on. Tony, it's gonna be fine, just relax. All right. Bye. Howard says that it's risky to use outside help. What do you think? >> He looked professional to me. >> It's true, you have a thing about truckers. >> So are you gonna do it once we get paid? >> Do what? >> Get the new Jag. Put the top down, put me on top. >> Hmm. On the interstate? >> Yeah... And doing eighty. >> You know you're crazy. You have a death wish lady, you know that? Fine. But not in rush hour, Okay? >> Okay. [upbeat music] [thumping] [thumping] [thumping] [muffled screaming] >> Why? Why? Why? Aaaaaaaargh! Why? >> Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Quiet! I did not put you in there. [melodious music] Thank you. Cheque please. >> So, I was supposed to be some kind of artwork. I knew it tasted funny. >> What? >> After we met, Nigel served orange juice. It tasted, funny. >> So if they spiked it, they got all the dosage wrong. >> I didn't drink it all. I poured it down the sink cause I didn't want to ruin the mood. This guy Adrian had just offered me a job. And then I felt tired, like sick tired and I sat down on the couch for a second and I woke up in the dark. I have never been so scared in my life. >> Why would they do that? >> Where are we? >> A restaurant. >> Like how far from the city? >> Two hours north. >> So as soon as we get back we call the cops, right? I mean, this bastard's going to jail and I want my purse back. >> I'm not going back right now. >> What? >> I have to deliver the trunk. >> So you are one of them! You were just curious what you were carrying this time? Look, if you think you can put me back in that... >> You're not going to be in the trunk. That's a butter knife. >> So what am I supposed to do? >> Call a cab, call your mom. Just don't call the cops till after six. >> Fine. Excuse me! >> Yes ma'am. >> I was wondering if you guys are going to the city. I could use a lift. >> Sure thing. Truck's right over here. >> Wasn't your boyfriend gonna drive you? >> He's not my boyfriend and he's going the other way. >> Well, let's go. >> Right on up, honey. >> I don't need your help. Actually, I changed my mind. >> What's wrong? >> I changed my mind. Forget it! >> Hey, we do you a favor, you do us a favor. Not to much to ask for two hundred miles. >> I said I'm not going! >> It's all right. We can exchange favours right here. >> Stop it! >> She said stop it. >> Get off of me! >> That's a big nail clipper. >> Go to hell! Aah! >> You broke my leg! You broke my leg! >> Aargh! >> It's Howard. Not bad. She'll be here around six. When are you guys picking her up? Great. Thanks. [melodious music] >> Why do you still wanna deliver the trunk? >> Because I need the money. >> They're gonna open it. They'll wait till I leave, wouldn't you? >> Why? >> Because I'm not part of it! >> You will be if you take the money. How much will you get? >> Five.>> Five bucks!? >> Five hundred upon delivery. I've already got five hundred on pick-up. >> So one thousand. That's it, that's all I'm worth? >> The people who bought you are paying a lot more, I'm sure. I've got to hide you somewhere. They expect me to be alone. [truck beeping] >> All right. >> This came with it. >> They said they'd use a combination lock. Thank you, Mr. Stanton. >> You're welcome. [saxophone playing] >> It's over. >> Sorry, I fell asleep. It's so dark in there. Did you get your money? But they'll come after you. They'll, they'll come to your home. >> I don't have one. >> Where do you sleep? >> Here. >> This is all you've got. That's why you needed the money. [phone ringing] >> Kaminsky gallery. >> I just paid someone five hundred dollars, for a tree stump! >> What are you talking about? >> Probably oak or chestnut. How the fuck should I know? >> Funny! Where's the girl? >> Don't you think if I knew that, I'd be on my way there? Hey, my ass is on the line, too. >> So the lock has been broken, right? >> You're talking about the combo lock? >> Yes! There is only one! >> What I got was a regular lock and an envelope with a key. >> All right now listen, just keep the rest of the money until I sort this out, all right? And try to find something to say to the clients, I don't know, anything. >> You've reached Austin's machine. You know what to do. >> Hi, it's Adrian. Listen, I hate to bother you but something has come up. I really need you. I'll be in the West End at seven. Please, please be there. Thanks. [dramatic music] >> I heard you, it gets worse. >> What if it's not him? >> Same name, same face, background in security. That's his wife we shot. >> Fuck! Do you think he knows? >> No. That's the thing. >> Good! Let's keep it that way. Don't even tell Linda or Austin. We'll get him long before he knows who we are. [dramatic music] [seagulls squawking] >> What is this? >> I need to withdraw some money. >> There's no bank here. >> Mine is. >> What if someone found it? >> The locals think it's haunted. It's safer than a bank. >> I don't get it. You live in a cube van, you withdraw money from a hole in the wall. What are you running from? >> Roots. Why? >> They've been cut before, it hurts like hell. [dramatic music] >> So what are you guys doing, planning a robbery or something? >> She's gone! >> What do you mean she's "gone"? >> She's fucking gone! The guy took her out of the box, put another lock, and kept the money! >> So he knew. >> How could he fucking know? I found the guy in the yellow pages! >> He couldn't have known. >> Maybe the guy was nosy or something and wanted to take a look, but who gives a shit? The girl is gone! >> What if they've called the cops, Adrian? >> They would have been all over us by now. >> You know, he's right. Shit! Maybe he was happy and he kept the money or something. But you know what we're gonna do, we're gonna find her, find him, recover the money and stop using the yellow pages. >> I'll say, [chuckling] >> Damn it! This is my fault! I should have driven that package. >> Don't worry about it. We're gonna catch this prick, swat him like a fly. You just be here for the ride. [dramatic music] >> Jesus! I thought you left without me. >> Not a chance, pal. I need a guide when I hit the tropics. >> Man, it must be ages. >> Trev, this is Lisa. She's catching a ride to town. >> Hi.>> Hi. Nice to meet you. >> You too. >> She needs a room with a phone and a shower. >> The phone lines are busted ma'am. The storm knocked down the wires and they're still trying to fix them down the highway. Actually, you just missed a hell of a blackout. >> It's okay, no big deal. >> You just make yourself at home though, okay. A couple of doors down. >> Thank you. >> Hey Donna, look who's here. >> Hello Raymond. Long time no see. >> Nice to see you too, Donna. You look great. [whispering] You know, she didn't know she was gonna go for the whole day and the evening, do you have an old T-shirt or something she could wear? >> Just come on inside, I'm sure we can do much better than that. T-shirts are for truckers. Oh and you bums wash your hands for dinner. [dramatic music] >> We got them! Son of a bitch had lunch here, with the girl. Waitress said they left in such a hurry they almost ran two truckers over. What's wrong, buddy? Ain't it the best news all day, we got them! Shove it down his throat till he coughs up the money. Then we can have some fun with little Miss America. >> Wayne, give me the gun. Jesus Christ! Wayne, you have no idea what you're doing. If the buyers had any idea you were even thinking about that girl, they'd make dog food out of you. >> That art school of yours didn't turn you into some kind of sissy, did it? >> Fuck it, I'm driving. >> Oh, thanks. You can tell they're lonely, though. I know more about Donna's niece than I do about my own sister. >> How old's your sister? >> Adele just turned eighteen. >> Are you close? >> Yeah. She lives with my grandma. Not for long though, she has her own room and it's "off limits". She's good. Better in school than I used to be. Brrr... It's cold. >> Take my jacket. >> What?! You have a gun?! What do you have a gun for? >> It's not real. >> This isn't real? >> No, it's a BB gun, a plinker. Compressed air... >> Well, it can still kill somebody, right? >> Well, I don't know, If you shoot them in the eye or something. >> What do you use it for? God, it sure looks real. It's great. Where did you get it? >> This, this guy gave it up. >> Why? >> He got into music. >> Go show her the clothes. Oh, don't get soft on me, Trevor. >> Jeez!>> What happened? >> I thought it's gone away. >> That's from the truckers, right?>> Yeah. >> It looks really bad. What if it's broken? >> No, it's just bruised. >> From Trevor. He says the ice is pointless without it. >> He's right. Ouch! Some more ice. >> I want you to know I don't normally hop into bed with people I just met. >> I want you to know I don't normally fight truckers over hitchhikers. >> Really? What do you do? >> Run them over. [dramatic music] >> Shit! Where are we? >> The guy's truck is right there. I'm gonna go in and see what room he's in and see if the girl's with him. Why don't you stay here. >> Whatever you say, man, you're the boss. >> I know that. [dramatic music] >> How can I help you? >> Hey man, sorry to wake you. My truck broke down about a mile south, so I figured I'd try and catch some sleep and fix it in the morning. You got a room? Is that Ray's truck out there? >> Yeah, you know him? >> No man, do I know God? I used to work for the same guy doing runs up North. Is he still the same quiet loner? >> Not anymore. The middle bungalow has just become the honeymoon suite, I tell you. [pager beeping] [pager beeping] >> Ray, your pager. >> Stay here, don't open for anyone. >> You know what I'm thinking? It's dark along that road, I should really stay with the truck. Company policy. Tell that son of a bitch to drop by and see me sometime and tell me about her. Yeah, yeah, what's your name? >> Peter, sorry for the trouble. >> Aah, no trouble. [dramatic music] >> Fucking shame. What am I gonna tell my... Aaargh! >> Are you alone?>> Yeah. >> Are you alone? Hmm, finished it, eh? If you shoot me, you're gonna get your buddy too. >> Funny thing is I don't give a fuck about my buddy. Now back it up, real slow. Wayne, pick up the fucking gun and handcuffs, it's embarrassing. [gun firing] [car engine starting] [knocking on door]>> Lisa! We can go now! >> Ray... What's all the noise about, man? >> Oh! Some drunk kids messing around the van. They're gone now. >> But... You guys are going now? What's... What's going on? >> She's not feeling well... [dramatic music] [tires screeching] >> Are you gonna tell me why we're headed North? >> To visit a friend. >> We're chased by what seems like some crazy nightmare and you need to socialize? >> He's an ex-cop. He could help us. >> I'm not gonna waste your time or mine. My buddy just got shot by that guy with the cube. Where did he leave and when? >> Look, mister... Guests only tell me when they arrive. They don't tell me when they leave, I mean... Even so, I couldn't tell you, it's hotel policy. >> This change your policy? >> South. They're going downtown. Some emergency with the girl. [gun firing] >> My policy. >> What happened back there? Someone tried to break into our room? >> They came after us. >> Who? How?... How many? >> Can you drive this thing? >> No! >> Then you're gonna have to ask him. >> Ask who? Ask what? Holy shit! We kidnapped somebody? >> You have to find out who he is and who's after us. >> What if he won't tell me? >> There are a pair of pliers in the red box. Use them. >> I, I can't torture someone. >> We need to know and we can't stop. >> I'll torture him. [dramatic music] >> I've never done this before, so I'm probably not very good at it. But I can't drive the truck and he's gonna get real mad if I don't find out who you are... And who else is after us. Stop it! I have to do this. [muffled screaming] I forgot about this. >> Okay! Okay, I'll tell you. Sweet God! I'll tell you! Are you trying to kill me? I'll tell you! >> That's for scaring me half to death in the motel room. You'd better tell me who you are and everything else. >> Oh Jesus Christ. >> His name is Austin Kaminsky. He went out looking for us with this other guy Wayne. He was sent by his brother. >> Adrian Kaminsky. >> Right. Mr. art dealer. >> Good! >> What's good about it? >> Well, it's only them, at least for now. >> They wanted my eyes for transplants. If they used only one, I'd be put to work in a factory. If they used both, it would be in a brothel for diplomats. [phone ringing] >> Yeah hi, hi boss. Sorry to wake you. [dramatic music] >> Wayne. You guys all right? >> Yeah. >> Did you find them? >> Yeah. He had the girl. >> Good. So, bring her back and get rid of his body. >> They're gone. He killed Austin. >> What do you mean killed Austin... How? >> I don't know. I was supposed to get the gun and the cuffs and and he did something, and... and Austin's on the ground... and... and now they're all gone. >> Okay, Wayne! Wayne! You're not drunk are you? >> No. >> Good! So you're gonna drive back right now and tell me exactly what happened, from the beginning, okay? >> Okay. [seagulls squawking] [knocking on door] [melodious music] [knocking on door] >> Get your hands up. >> Eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen. Not bad for an old man. >> Jesus, Raymond. You trying to get yourself killed? >> Is that how you greet people? >> Well... Last time a cube van showed up in this neighbourhood, Ron over there had his house completely emptied. They even took the TV antenna. Good to see you though. What are you doing here? >> A friend needs advice. >> The blonde in the van? Is she hungry? >> Always, why? >> Well, the fridge is empty. You're going to have to... catch her dinner yourself. [techno music] >> Hi, Adele? Lisa's sister?>> Yes? >> Linda Phan from Kaminsky Music. Your sister's just made the short list in auditions for a rock video. She asked us to get you because she'll be a while doing the test shoots. >> She never told me. >> Oh... She kept it as a surprise. >> And she wants me there? >> As soon as possible. >> Cool! [techno music] >> Hey! Hey! Open up! Jesus Christ! Somebody, open up! Come on! >> Keep that up and I'll retape your mouth myself. >> I've gotta pee. >> The key's in the tool box... Christ! [seagulls squawking] >> You know, before my wife divorced me, all we ever did was talk about the restaurant we were gonna build out here. Seafood, live music, the works. Then she just left. And I, let go. You fight to keep what's yours. [dramatic music] >> Thanks. >> No problem. >> So where are you taking me? >> I don't know. >> He doesn't say much, does he? >> Neither should you. Or he'll put the tape back on your mouth. >> I'll trade that for a few more words with you. >> I heard all I needed last night. >> Listen, that's my brother's stuff. >> Then why did you have to be there? >> Babysitting. Wayne's big enough to take orders, but he's way too little to follow through with them. >> So he sent you both. Kind of like... The muscle and the brain? >> I guess. So how can you say you're not part of it? >> Look lady! Have you ever wanted something really bad, but you just seem to be a nickel short? You know, the whole world's riding on a fucking... nickel and you just, you have to stretch to get it. [dramatic music] >> Then... I tell them: "You're in the middle of a warehouse district... blocks of noisy machinery and not a damn residence, and you're afraid... of one little scream? What's that gonna do?" When I was eight and I screamed every night, they didn't hear me down the hall. Assholes! Men are pigs, don't you think? It's nice that you have a sister who loves you. I don't think mine did. She always played with boys if she had a choice. I think women should stick together more, don't you? You know, you're even prettier than your sister. And I'll make you a promise that I won't let them hurt you. Mind if I seal it with a kiss? >> Whatever you guys were talking about, I want you to know what's happening. You see, your sister is a part of this agreement which we paid her some money against future work, right? But she's gone... and she didn't do her part. So we need you to help us talk to her when she gets back. Are you agreed with that? >> Yes. >> Good. I'm sorry about my secretary. Sometimes she goes too far on her lunch break. [dramatic music] >> Don't ever, ever touch the merchandise again! >> What do you care? They won't remember a thing. >> I'm trying to be a professional. You want to stay the same wondering whore? >> Fuck you, Adrian! >> Oh, obviously with what I've seen I'm not the first choice, am I? I've never stopped you from anything. But please, don't touch the merchandise. >> The buyers are my contacts. >> We've gotta get the both sisters. Just think of the cash. >> And the Jag? >> Uh-huh! Are you interested? Hmm? [soulful music] >> Music sounds good up here. >> Do you miss the city? >> Nah, I got everything I need. >> Do you always catch your dinner? >> Never. >> So this is your first one? >> No. They, they always have them here. >> What is he talking about? >> The market down the road. >> That's it. I'm leaving. Just kidding. >> Hey! I know that jacket. Jesus, Raymond. That was years ago. >> Well, the jacket and the flashlight are the only two things I kept since the bank. >> Well, why don't I throw these into the sink. >> I'm not done. >> Okay. You guys take your time. I'll bring back dessert. [soulful music] >> What did you mean "after the bank"? >> My wife got killed in a bank robbery. Things kind of changed since. >> I'm sorry. Were you there? >> Yeah. [dramatic music] All right! My private reserve. Don't anybody dare say no. Ladies first. >> Thank you. >> You bet. >> That's enough. >> A toast to... old friends. >> To new friends. Was he always this tough? >> Ray? He used to practice staring in the mirror. >> Practice what? >> Looking tough. They said, it's all in the attitude. >> Did it work? >> Yeah, no mirror gave me trouble since. >> You guys make me miss my family. Let me go call my sister. [men grunting] >> Gentlemen! Gentlemen! Gentlemen! You were referred to us because you are professionals, and very well respected in your field. Your skills, however, are needed for exactly the opposite of what you're used to. We're going to keep someone alive and safe. Her name's Adele, she's eighteen, and she's very scared. Now, some people are after her and tomorrow at twelve I'm going to help her leave the country for a quieter place and a better future. Your job, is to guarantee that, until then, she's safe. Short of an act of God, nobody and I mean nobody, can come near her. Not even angels in her dreams. Understood? Now, show me your hardware and we'll work out your spots. [dramatic music] >> What about me? >> Who's that? >> I hired her. >> She's gone! She didn't get home today, Grandma thought she was with me! >> How would they know about your sister if she wasn't living with you? >> I told the photographer all about her. How pretty she is, how she'd be really good at it too. It's all my fault. >> Let's call the cops. >> No. >> What do you mean, no? They could ship her out too. We gotta hurry. >> They're holding her for ransom. >> I'm going to the gallery. >> She's not at the gallery! >> What did we agree on? >> She's not at the gallery. He's not that stupid. He has a warehouse in the West End. >> Wait Ray. Why should we believe anything you say? >> Because I'm not going to jail. Adrian is. I, I wanted no part of this. >> Unfortunately you are part of it! He's wasting our time. >> No he's not! >> How do you know? >> He went for a pee, but he came back. >> Well... you are either brilliant or you're completely fucked up. How do we get to the warehouse? >> We? >> Well, you can't do this with just his help. >> What do we have? >> 508 transceivers, your C2 MagLight, 8-22 binoculars and the shotgun. >> Kinda thin. >> Well, I'm retired. Anyhow, we're not trying to start a war. Thing's are bound to break wide open anyhow. Thing's are bound to break wide open anyhow. [dramatic music] >> Okay. Remember, no microphone. Earphone picks up bone vibration, so you can't whisper. But you got both hands free. Take it. >> No. Got this. >> You didn't tell me. >> I didn't feel like a speech about firearm safety. >> Huh! How about this? >> A flashlight I could use. >> Ray... Do it, so we can have a nice, quiet lunch after. Okay? [dramatic music] >> It's a no smoking area. Ray? [dramatic music] [dramatic music] >> Freeze! Who are you? >> What seems to be the problem? Don't you like my work? >> Enough playing. Goodnight. [dramatic music] >> Ray... Big guy, six foot three, heavy built just turned into the alley. Ray! Ah, damn! You wait fifteen minutes and if we're not back, call the cops. [dramatic music] >> Hands up! And definitely away from the case. >> I call it "spray and pray". >> Navy SEAL talk. >> We all have our baggage. You must be pretty good too, if you got past the others. However, they're just migrant workers, journeymen. You see, I make a living at this. A very good one, all the toys. But I also feel that technology is highly overrated. Impersonal. I left when they gave us tracking devices because I hate bosses over my shoulder or clipped on my belt. Men of our caliber can do without bullets. [dramatic music] You afraid of the dark? >> Only of those in it. >> Not me, man. [dramatic music] [gun firing]>> Aah! [gun firing] [dramatic music] >> Aargh! [gun firing]>> Aah! >> God damn it, Ray! Can you hear me? >> Loud and clear. >> Jesus, where were you? >> Taking out the garbage. >> Big guy just walked in. Could it be Wayne? >> What's he look like? >> Six three, dark hair, average mountain size. >> That's him. >> Must be on top of you by now. >> I haven't seen anyone yet. [dramatic music] >> Too bad you're not staying. You'd have had company. >> Shit! >> What's happening, Lisa? >> This sports car just went in. >> That's Adrian's. >> Oh shit, they didn't tell me what to do for that. I'm gonna call the cops now. >> No, no, no. They said wait fifteen minutes. >> And then what? >> Lisa, you've gotta let me go in there. >> You're crazy! I can't do that! >> My brother's never done anything stupid before, but with your sister, he's gone way overboard with this one. Let me go in there. I can talk to him. I can talk sense into him. I can stop this from happening, Lisa. >> Forget it! Just forget it! >> I shouldn't even talk to you until my boss gets here. But there's one little detail I'm sure he wouldn't care about. My mickey! That was a silver-plated, monogrammed gift, you stupid son of a bitch! When this is over, I'll personally make sure you join your wife. >> What about my wife? >> Nothing. We'll just finish what we started. >> You son of a... >> Shitheads... Now you're lopsided. Gotta fix ya. >> Don't bother! Face down on the ground! Do it! Spread em wide. >> Gun on the left side. >> Well, well, well! A houseful of guests. Well obviously, you know the routine, so you and Wayne are going to trade places. Thank you. Do it! >> Maybe they're FBI or something. >> Nah, they would be all over us by now, but we should be careful. Linda! Take Adele to the other room. I wanna thank you for getting rid of the other guys outside. See, I didn't pay them yet, which is good considering the incompetence. I'll start with you for your lack of professionalism. Wayne has his own reasons. >> Who shot her? >> Beg your pardon? >> My wife. >> Ah... Your wife. Wayne has a big mouth, doesn't he? Hmm? Well, doesn't matter. Well, I'll apologize if it makes any difference, but I doubt it, right? But I'm the one asking the questions now. So where is Austin's body? Okay. It's a funny thing, but Wayne has a thing about chains and I suggest you don't encourage it, but then it's really up to you. So what do you say? Where is Austin's body? Okay. >> Aah! Oh! >> Mr. Stanton. I don't have much time. Whatever you're gonna say has to be confirmed with your colleague here. So... Okay Wayne, the other knee. >> Don't! >> You said he was dead! >> How would he know? From a rearview mirror? >> You fucked up, man! >> Shut up, Wayne. You both fucked up. Oh, now, what's up with the gun? Where's your girl? >> The girl's with me. It's over. Adrian, you have gone too far. Take a look around man. People are dead! >> Come on man. We're brothers. We're supposed to be close. >> That's close enough. >> You're not gonna shoot your brother. >> No, but I can stop him. [gun firing]>> Aah! [gun firing] >> That was my brother! [gun firing] >> Way to go, Adrian. >> Things got a little bit out of hand. >> The hell with you! It was supposed to be simple and clean fun! >> It still can be. Just drive to the airport. Our client is landing at seven. All we need... is a good delivery. >> The clients are mine. It's my delivery, and I don't like being pulled by the hair. [gun firing]>> Aah! >> What about us? >> Let her go! >> Oh, the lost and found merchandise. You're late. We got a replacement. >> Not if I can help it. [gun firing]>> Aah! >> Get the handcuff keys. Where are the others? >> Dead. >> Ray and Norm are dead? >> No, no, just Wayne and the last one. Adrian was just bleeding. >> You stay right here, okay? [dramatic music] >> Oh my God. Ray. >> Thank you. [gun firing] >> Linda's got your sister. >> Not anymore. >> What do you mean? >> She took the BB gun for a toy. [laughing] Oh, Ray. [dramatic music] >> Freeze, asshole! Adele, run away! >> Mr. Stanton. Agent Rittman, FBI. >> Yeah and I'm the pizza guy. >> No Ray, that badge does look real. I think I know the name too. >> Why should I believe him? You worked with them. >> Against them. You've heard of undercover. >> You paid me client money. >> Agency funds. There weren't any clients this time. >> How come you're so late? >> We thought you were one of them. Had to leave you alone so we round you up together. But you're hard to keep up with. >> Do I have to return the money. >> It's complicated, but I can work on it. So what happened here? >> It's complicated, but you can work on it. >> Textbook first aid. So, what next? >> I need a job. >> I think I'll sell the van. >> Don't. That's your home. Maybe I'll come visit you sometime. >> Sure, my doors are open. [police sirens wailing] [dramatic music]
