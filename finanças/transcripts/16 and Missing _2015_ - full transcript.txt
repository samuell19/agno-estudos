( keyboard clicking ) Weatherman: The forecast, showers heavy at times with occasional thunderstorms today... Mommy, why do you have to go away so much? Oh, baby, I don't go away that often. Yes, you do. - ( chuckles ) - You kind of do, Julia. Guys, I'm so sorry. Father: Mommy has a very important job. I still don't understand what you do. She helps keep people safe. Like me? Yeah, just like you. Thanks, Mommy. I love you. I love you, too, sugar bear. Ms. Foster. Hey, Jack. So where are you heading now? You know I can't tell you that. Well, I thought maybe you would slip up just once. ( laughs ) I love you guys. We love you, too. How long are you going to be gone this time? One week. Okay? I'm sorry. It's what I signed up for. It's all part of being married to an FBI agent. You know, I've been thinking about maybe asking some of the younger agents to cover my fieldwork, and I could do a little bit more work from home. Do you think they can handle the job? I think it's worth the chance. Well, let's talk about it when you get back. In the meantime, you go about protecting whoever it is that you're protecting, and just make sure you come home safely, okay? Yeah, I will. You know, I'm gonna go to some pretty cool countries. You want me to bring you back anything? Coffee. Coffee? ( laughs ) What? Yeah. You and daddy drink it all the time, so it must be good. Coffee is not for kids, silly. Not even a little bit. How about a doll? No. I want coffee. Coffee, okay. Coffee it is. I love you. - Love you. - I love you, too. Bye. Hi. ( chuckles ) - Thanks. - I'll take this. Bye, Mommy. I love you. I love you. Be safe. You okay, huh? - Yes. - All right. Thank you. Rain is starting to come down. Can you believe this? I miss Mommy already. I know. I miss mommy, too. But you and I are going to have so much fun that Mommy will be back before you know it, right? - Okay. - All right. * Oh, my goodness. Oh, my God! ( laughs ) It's so phat. So cool. Oh, my goodness. ( screams ) And you're sure you're not spoiling her? No, I'm giving her autonomy. Do you know how much time that's gonna save us? I know. But a brand-new car? Mother: Yeah, a new car is a safe car. That's true but, you know, she's been a little-- Not today, babe. I love that little girl. I'd do anything for her. You know she's had a rough time. Thank you. Thank you, Mom. - Of course, baby. - Oh. - Thanks, Daniel. - Happy Birthday, kiddo. It's beautiful. Good. It's beautiful. It's a car. It's dangerous, okay? So smart and safe. Smart and safe, I got you, I promise. All right. You know, Abbey. Just one more time just to make sure you hear me-- smart and safe. Mom... I promise. So can I drive it? Oh. Um... It's her car. It is. Uh... wow. Uh, kids, guys, one at a time just around the block and back, all right? And no distractions, no radio, nothing like that, all right? Smart and safe. Yeah, I got you. Wow. Maybe I can take you on that date now. - In my new car? Don't think so. - Why not? Grow up, Bobby, if you wanna take me on a date, you have to get your own car first. My parents aren't nearly that cool. Now, do you wanna go? - Yeah, let's go. - Let's go. ( giggles ) So are we having cake or what? - And ice cream. - Cake and ice cream. Come on, let's eat it all before the girls get back! ( giggling ) - Ready? - Okay, yes, let's go. Here we go. - ( laughs ) - Whoa. ( laughter ) Daniel, please tell them to stop. Oh, come on, Abbey, it was an accident. Really? An accident? - You always defend them. - I don't always defend-- All right, guys, come back and say you're sorry. By referring to it as an accident, you're trivializing what they did. - Hey, watch your tone please. - And now you're defending him? Does it ever stop? can you see what I've had to put up with ever since they moved in? Can't you guys see that you always gang up on me, all the time? Why are we living in the same house together? Can't you wait until I go away to college? You know what, you keep talking with that tone, - you're not gonna go to college. - I don't believe that. I'm sure you and Daniel can't wait till I go away to college. In fact, you probably bought me the car so you won't - have to see me as much. - Seriously? That's ridiculous. Come on, mom. Don't be a hypocrite. Don't you dare talk to-- Don't you dare talk to me that way! Okay? You're not my father. In fact, you just stay out of anything that relates to my mother and I. You know what, Janelle, I think it's time for you to go home. No, Janelle, needs to see that it's not always as perfect as it appears from the outside. Abbey! You are out of line! I'm out of line? Look what you've done to us. You brought him and you brought his two little brats into our house and ruined everything. You know what, Abbey? You told me that you liked Daniel. You told me that you wanted me to be happy. But what about my happiness? Did you ever think about me? I always think about you. No, you don't. I thought this was the right decision. It's not. Come on, Janelle! She's a teenager, right? I mean, she just is chemically imbalanced. I knew we should have waited till she went away to college to get married. No, no, we did the right thing, we did. She just has to... learn to be more understanding. ( laughs ) That is the understatement of the century. - Happy birthday. - Yeah. Happy Birthday. Let's go clean up. I hate my life. I feel really uncomfortable. I think I should get going. Did you see what they did? They gang up on me like that all the time. What are you doing? I need to talk to Gavin. He doesn't even know you. How can you say that? I've talked to him every day for the last two years. Yeah, by email. You don't really know him. Did Romeo and Juliet really know each other before they finally got together? ( chuckles ) Exactly. So why haven't you met him yet? Because he thought I wasn't old enough yet. He wanted to wait. - Wait until when? - Until I'm 16. Why 16? 16 is when I can drive and come see him. Well, I don't get it, if he's 23, why can't he come see you? Because I'm a minor, you know? It's illegal. But he can still get arrested. If he comes out here, you gotta-- where is he again? He lives in Prescott, Arizona. Where's that? It's a farm town west of Phoenix. You're Internet dating a farmer. He's not a farmer. He's a cop. Well, he can still go to jail for being with a minor. - If I'm emancipated, there's no problem. - Okay, emanci-what? It means that I'm legally separated from my mother, and then I'm no longer a minor in the eyes of the law. I bet Gavin figured that one out. You know what? He did. So what? Just that's a lot of work to go through just to see some guy you don't even know. Okay, I do know him. I know... I know everything about him. I haven't met another guy like him before. I don't know. I think Bobby Evans is pretty cute. Bobby Evans is 17 years old, okay? He's a kid. Gavin's a man. Gavin has traveled the entire world already. Gavin-- Gavin knows me. He understands me. I don't know, it just doesn't seem right to me. That's okay because you haven't experienced anything like this before. And when you do, you'll completely understand. ( knock on door ) Mother: Abbey? We need to talk. There's nothing to talk about. There's a lot to talk about, honey. Come out here and let's have a conversation face-to-face. Why? To tell me that I'm wrong? I'm not gonna be happy until he's out of this house. He's not going anywhere, honey. We're family now. Just come out here, and let's talk like families do. Okay, he is not my family. Abbey-- There's nothing more to talk about. Please... leave me alone. Fine. Tonight? They'll take your car away. Not if I'm in Arizona. Abbey, please think clearly. You don't know this guy. I do know him. Like... how could you say that? I'm just trying to be a good friend. I'm not looking for someone to play devil's advocate. Okay? Friends do not do that. You're wrong. That's what friends are supposed to do. Not the friends I want in my life. Fine. I'm outta here. Don't you dare tell my mother. Really? That's how you talk to your best friend? Real cool, Abbey. I don't know what's gotten into you, but I don't like it. Whatever. Hey. - Hey. - Hey. Come on, honey. She's 16, she's just going through a phase. She's not just 16. She's been traumatized. Well... I know. But she still has to be respectful to you, me and the kids. I know. I just want you to truly understand, you know, what it was that she went through. I get it, honey. But, uh... I'm sorry, but from what you told me about Lucas, I think he would want you to both to move on. It's been ten years. - Yeah. - Yeah. I just feel like such a... a bad mom, you know? She's so angry, and she's hurting, and... I just feel like this is all my fault. Oh, I'm sure smarter people than I am have told you it's not your fault. But-- but by the same token, we-- we can't be tormented by this every time there's an issue. And I'm sorry if "tormented" is too of a strong word. No, that's debatable. Well, yeah, because, you know, she-- she rules this house. She does whatever she wants to do. And all I'm saying about that is that maybe it's time to exact a little more control over it before things get completely out of hand. Now you've just given her some serious autonomy, so maybe along with that, some new rules and boundaries? I mean, she's a teenager. You remember what that feels like. - Ugh. - Yeah. I mean, her hormones are raging, her emotions are scattered, and now she's got this whole new sense of independence. - It's a lot. - You're right. I'm gonna let her cool off tonight, and I'll talk to her in the morning. Good idea. I tell you what, why don't we get a good night's sleep, because I'm sure everything's gonna look - a lot better in the morning. - I hope so. ( laughs ) And, and listen, please... don't ever let me hear you say you're a bad mother again, 'cause that's not true. Come on. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I miss you. * ( engine starts ) Girl: Abbey? Abbey? Abbey? Abbey, this isn't funny. She left last night. She-- she's gone. She's gone! Mom! She's gone! - Who's gone? - Abbey. She's not here, and her car is gone. - Did you see when she left? - No. Did you see when she left? - When? - Last night. - Why didn't you say anything? - Brendan. Because I wanted her gone. All she ever does is cause trouble. Oh, she probably just went to Janelle's house. I hope so. All right. No, Mommy, wait! Okay. Now what's this? Here, here it is. "Mom, I'm fine. Don't worry about me. I'm just visiting a friend. I'll be back soon. I love you, Abbey." Damn it, why is she doing this? All right. Anybody know her password? Oh, try I-H-A-T-E-M-Y-F-A "I hate my family"? Really? Not funny, really. Does anyone know her password? - Could be anything, honey. - Maybe Janelle knows it. Good. Where you going? - I'm going to Janelle's. - I'll call the police. I can't. They won't do anything. It's too soon. But what about your friends at the FBI, honey? Martin in missing persons owes me, you're right. ( beeping tone ) I'm gonna be happy. ( shouts ) I'm gonna be happy! I'm gonna be happy. Janelle: All I know is that his name is Gavin and he lives in Arizona. How long has she known this boy? He's not a boy. He's 23 years old. - You're kidding, 23 years o-- - Julia. What? What? Our daughter just ran away to Arizona to be with a 23-year-old man. They've had an online relationship for two years. Okay, that's just... impossible. Well, no disrespect, Mrs. Foster, but Abbey has a computer in her bedroom, a laptop and a cell phone. Not unless you've been monitoring her activity every second of the day would you have any idea what she's up to. Okay, well, that's the end of your privacy, young lady. Janelle, do you, um-- do you know Abbey's password? Janelle, your friend can be in danger. This is not the time to keep secrets. You need to tell us everything that you know. Honey. I don't know her Chatter password, but I do know her email password. Okay. Okay. Um, but that's not gonna help us. Yes, but I have a trick. Follow me to my bedroom. No, no, no, you just go get your laptop. That's right. No more laptop in the bedroom. You go get it and you bring it in the kitchen. - Wow. - Wow. All that you do is enter an email address and attempt to enter a password. Then, you see, it asks if you forgot your password. So you click that and it tells you to check your email to change your password. So then I go to her email and... that will link to an option to change her password. But now Abbey won't be able to get into her Chatter page. Good. Well, what if she needs it while she's gone? Nobody needs social media. A new invention called the phone, she can use that. - So what's her new password? - "Runaway" with a capital "R." Well, no one's gonna forget that. enter email address and new password, and voila, we're in. Julia: Gavin Brown, is that his name? Mother: He looks like a nice kid. Julia: He's not a kid. He's a grown man. Daniel: And he's a police officer. What's a 23-year-old cop doing with an 11th grader? I don't know. Julia: Oh... I can't believe she was doing this all behind my back. Is her life that miserable that she had to live some false existence? Well, it wasn't false to her and now that she's there, it's all too real. You gotta get on the phone with Martin immediately and find her. Who knows what this guy's motives are? Do me a favor, just go to the most recent messages He's gotta have given her some address or something. There, Prescott, Arizona. Father: Looks like a restaurant. Daniel: At least they're meeting in a public place. - I gotta get on the next plane. - I'll take you the airport. - Thank you. - Thank you. Thank you. Martin will set a plane up for you, right? - Yeah, of course. - Okay. That's so weird. What the-- what the hell is going on? Julia: So you're telling me there's no Gavin Brown working at the Arizona Police Department. Martin: Well, there were a few Browns, but no Gavins. Julia: Can you get into her Chatter now? Oh, come on now, Julia. You know our tentacles don't go that deep. So the NSA can record Germany's Prime Minister's conversations, but we can't get into social media sites? Yeah, that's right. Oh... that's insane. Well, those Silicon Valley guys have more money than us, so we can't even win in court. Look, I'll tell you what. I'll contact the San Jose office, see if they can help out. Call me back if you find anything out. Thank you. Jeez. You sure we're not overreacting? We don't even know the whole story yet. He is impersonating a police officer. That's bad. She's 16 years old. I didn't even give her permission to go down to the market, much less Arizona. No, we're not overreacting. Okay. Definitely not. I agree. Abbey: Have you heard from Daniel? - Janelle: No. - What about my mother? I haven't heard from them, but I'm sure your mom is worried sick about you. You should really come back home. I don't think so. She doesn't care about me. Gavin cares about me. How do you know if anything this guy has told you is true? Why would someone lie like that? Are you really that stupid? Okay, yeah. Yeah, I guess I am. You're a pretty 16-year-old girl. He wants his way with you. You're just jealous because you don't have a boyfriend. No, I'm not. I'm perfectly happy. What's wrong with you that you have to drive all the way out to Arizona to meet a guy? Meet a guy? I know him, okay? I know everything about him. We've talked every day for the last two years. Then why hasn't he come out to see you? Why are you driving all the way out to Arizona? He has a job. He can't just pick up and go. Really? That doesn't make sense. None of this sounds right. Please just turn your car around and come home. You know what? I don't need this from you. - No, you don't. - Okay, I'm hanging up. - Goodbye. - Abbey-- Abbey? Gavin. - ( laughs ) - Hey. What's wrong? You look so much different than your pictures. Different how? Uh... You look older. Older? I mean, my profile picture was just taken a few weeks ago. I don't know. I just-- I didn't expect you to look so different. See, this is why we're perfect for each other. This is why we're amazing. We have this relationship that's based on so much more than just looks. I've had the opportunity to fall in love with your mind. And you being gorgeous is just icing on the cake. Yeah, you're right. You could literally have the floppiest ears, the biggest nose, and it wouldn't even matter because I've already fallen in love with the beautiful person that you are. I'm sorry, Gavin. Don't be. You're so right. Not yet. Why not? This-- this isn't the right place for our first kiss. It's-- it's not? No, I imagine someplace... epic, someplace beautiful, you know, not the porch of an old restaurant. Old guys are staring at us with dogs. But I have the biggest day planned for us. So let's get going, and then we'll end the end of the night with some dinner at the ranch and some wine. - Wine? - Yeah, wine. You are a grown, mature, capable woman. I'm sure you can handle a little bit of wine. - Of course, I can. - Of course, you can. Uh... so where's your car? Oh, they don't let me use the patrol car - when I'm off duty. - Okay, do you want to use mine? - Do you mind? - Do you wanna drive? - Do you want me to drive? - Yeah. Then I can drive. Hey, sleepyhead. I'm not sleepy. - No? - No. Well, you drove all night. You must be tired. I can't believe I'm here and-- and we're finally together. What did I tell you? The moment you turn 16, we can finally be together. And here we are. You know that moment when Romeo first meets Juliet? - Yeah. - That's how I feel right now. I feel like we were in this expansive room watching you from afar, and now suddenly, we're close. Pretty soon I'll kiss you. ( chuckles ) Okay, that's so romantic. It's just what I feel. You always used to say write how you feel. But I have to think about it. You can just come out and say it with such perfection. - I do have a few years on you. - Okay, that's true. And you, you are so wise beyond your 16 years. I swear you have the beauty and a mind of a woman, not a child. That's what fascinates me about you. ( chuckles ) So where are we going? You will just have to wait and see. ( chuckles ) Do you like country music? Okay, ever since you sent me those songs, it's all I've been listening to. - I knew you'd like it. - Yeah, I do. Well, listen to this one. And relax, okay? Take a nap. Woman: * Hello, my name is * How's your day? They are * So ordinary to me... * Though, and you said then, "Come at me" * * Guess you weren't talking from the old dictionary... * * But all my life needs * Is just you, oh-oh-oh... * Just you... Hey there, sleeping beauty. ( groans softly ) You were really knocked out there for a minute. Yeah. I stopped, and I got you some food. Yes! I am starving! Yeah, I figured as much. ( gasps ) Fries. You love me. You know me so well. You sent me pictures of this view, huh? That's right. This is one of my favorite places. I spend a lot of time here, you know, just writing, thinking. Wow. It's beautiful. Just like you. And it makes quite the backdrop for our first kiss, huh? No? You okay? Yeah, I'm just-- I'm just nervous. Nerves are good. Yeah, that mean that you care and that you're excited. Are you nervous? I'm so nervous with excitement because I've been waiting for this moment for two years. Yeah, me too. Is it okay? It's all right. Thanks for asking. Why are you stopping? Hey. Hey. What's wrong? We should probably take this somewhere a little more private. Yeah. Woman: * Yes, you're perfect for me * You are the air I breathe * You're oxygen to me Man: How you doing there, young lady? - Hey, old man. - Hey. Retired and feeling good. How you doing? Been better. - You all right? - Let's go. Let's do what you came to do. So what brings you to Prescott? I got a feeling there's more to the story. Got a feeling you're not just on a little hunting trip. It's my daughter Abbey. She, uh, she's been talking to this guy online for two years. I had no idea. She just turned 16 and jumps in the car to go meet him. She must really be in love with him. She's 16, she doesn't know anything about love. Besides, I have a feeling there's something more sinister going on. Sinister, huh? That's a strong word. Yeah, he's 23. You sure you don't wanna maybe just break his legs? That's why I'm here. You could do a hell of a lot more with what I brought you. - Oh, great. - Check it out. That what you're looking for? That's exactly what I'm looking for. - Do you have the rifle? - Yup. That's in the back, too. Then you got all your ammo is in the case. You got an M-15 back there. You really need to pack this much heat? It's better to be safe than sorry, right? I guess. I'll tell you something, Julia. Ever since I retired from the agency, life has been great. The biggest trouble I've got is maybe fixing a leaky roof or a broken fan belt. I'm glad to hear that, Monty, but trouble seems to follow me. Yeah, well, don't use any of that unless you have to, because I need somebody to take care of me in my old age, okay? I'm meeting a buddy of mine at Ed's Diner. So you borrow my truck, and I'll have my buddy give me a ride home. All right. Here it is. All right. You sure about this? Hey, I'm happy to help you any time, okay? You ever need anything, you call me. All right. Thank you. Nope, you don't thank me. I thank you. You're the one that saved my life, remember? Yeah, well, it's part of the job. Well, not everybody does their job the way you do. I'm forever grateful, all right? So enough with the sappy stuff. You got my truck. I'd like to get it back without any bullet holes. - Okay. - If you need anything, call me. Deal. Thank you. You won't believe this. Julia: I can't believe anything right now. So we were able to extrude some information based off the sites and passwords you gave us, right? And it appears that Gavin Brown from-- you ready for this? At this point, I prepared myself for anything. From inside of the Arizona State Correctional Institution. Great, my daughter is with a convict. Were you expecting anything different? But here's the thing, there hasn't been any activity on the account for the past month, and now she's planning on meeting with him, so it appears that he's been let out. How did he have access from prison? Sadly, these prisoners get access to their social media from prison libraries, cell phones being smuggled in, guards giving them access, you name it, they'll find a way. Now this is a standard ruse these prisoners run in order to get a girlfriend while they're in jail and have someone to see when they get out. But how did he find her specifically? Probably by random. What this guys do is they send out their feelers to hundreds of young girls, right? It's called catfishing. All it takes is for just one of them to bite. Well, she bit, all right. Where should I start looking? Well, I would start with their original meeting point at the restaurant in Prescott. In the meantime, I'll go through some of the prison's videos, some mug shots, cross-reference it with his photos. Thanks, Martin. Hey, Julia, listen, this is your daughter, right? There's nothing more important. Gavin: How'd you become such a good kisser? ( chuckles ) I don't know. I haven't had much practice. Well, you got great instincts. Thanks. ( laughs ) It looks so peaceful. There's a lot of character. Yeah. I bet there's a lot of family history here. My mother was actually born in this house. Wow. I bet you played right on the steps You're very intuitive. I actually spent a lot of hours playing with my father here. Do I get to meet your parents? I don't even know anything about them. Unfortunately, they-- they're no longer around. Oh, I'm... sorry. I guess that's why you never talked about them. What happened? My father was killed. Killed? Was he in the military? Well... something like that. He was actually murdered in the line of duty by his own partner. Was it an accident? No. Definitely not an accident. I'm so sorry. And then my mother died a couple of years later. How did she die? She was diagnosed with cancer, but I think that she died of a broken heart. That's so sad. I'm so sorry, Gavin. Yeah, it was a long time ago. It's funny how that stuff never seems to leave you. Trust me... I know. Yeah? My father was murdered when I was just six years old. You never told me that. I was afraid to. I thought you might not like me. That's silly. So I-- I got to be honest. That's exactly what I thought. That's why I always Mr. Inspiring and Mr. Optimistic because I didn't want you to think I was a depressing person. I'm sorry you had to do with all the stories of teenage angst. No. No. No. I-- I liked it. I liked being able to-- to help you. Well, you did. You did, 'cause if it-- if it wasn't for you, I don't think I would have gotten through the last couple of years when my mom married Daniel. When my dad died, it was devastating. Devastating. And when my mom married Daniel, it was like-- It was like a dagger going straight through my heart. How did your father die? Do you really wanna know? I wanna know everything about you. It was ten years ago, and I remember everything so clearly, like it was yesterday. My dad and I brought my mom to the airport 'cause she had a business trip. Oh, my God. Are you okay? Yeah, I guess so. Daddy's gonna go talk to this guy, okay? - Daddy-- - It's okay, no, it's okay. I'll be-- I'll be right back. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'll be right back, okay? Look, you can see me right through the window. Fine, just a second. Sit tight. I'll be right back, okay? All right. Just stay right there. I'll be right back. What are you doing, man?! You slammed on your brakes! Here's my driver's license? I gotta get my registration out of my car, okay? Daddy! Dad! Daddy! ( screams ) ( screams ) Daddy! Daddy? Wake up, Daddy. ( groaning ) Where are we? We're inside the van. Who are you? Why are you doing this? Did he hurt you? Are you all right? I thought you were dead. Oh, Daddy's fine. I'm gonna be all right, okay? Listen, we gotta get out of this van, right? I promise you... it's gonna be all right, okay? Okay. ( van stops ) Run Abbey, run! Run and hide! Run! - Run! Hide! - Hey! Daddy! Don't leave me! Daddy! ( screams ) I'm so sorry. My father was found in the woods... bound and gagged and shot... right in the head. Who could do such a thing? Well, an animal could do that. My mom and I had a really close relationship before she married Daniel. She married him just like that? Must have been very insensitive of her. Yeah, it was insensitive. You know, he-- he came right in and tried to control everything. And on top of that, his two kids are brats. Well, you don't have to worry about that anymore. And why is that? Because you have me. How'd I get so lucky? We're just meant to be. - Hey. - What? Let's check out the inside. Get over here, come on. Would you guys be okay with peanut butter and jelly? - Uh-huh. - We had it for lunch. - ( cell phone rings ) - Oh, it's Mom. Don't say anything about sitting on the counter, okay? Hey, honey, you okay? Hey, don't worry about me. okay? Just keep monitoring the phones, and contact all of her friends. Just tell them if she contacts them, to call you immediately, all right? - I love you. - I love you, too. - Daniel? - Yeah? Look, keep the kids close. Don't go to any public places right now, all right? I don't understand. Why, Julia? Just a safety precaution. Okay, I'll be careful. Be careful, too. You save some cookies for me? Mm-hmm. How about cookies for dinner instead? ( light folk music playing ) Hello. How can I help you? I'm looking for a guy named Gavin Brown. - I don't know him. - Are you sure? I've worked here for five years. I would know. Okay, look, here's some pictures. Maybe that'll help. Let me see those pictures. I could swear he was in here this morning with a young girl. Um, was it this girl? Could be. It looks like her. Are they in trouble? This is my daughter, and she ran away to be with him. So, yes, they are in trouble. Well, I saw them leave in a red car. Right, did you see where they went? No, they talked outside for a little while and then they took off together. I didn't see him drive off, but they weren't on the sidewalk for too long. Um, you know, here's-- here's my card. Call me if you think of anything or if they come back in okay? Of course. I've got a daughter, too. - I understand. - Thanks. Ma'am? Hey, Ma'am? I might be able to help you. Appreciate the help. That man you were looking for, he was definitely here today. - Was he? - Yep. He met with your daughter here just a couple of hours ago. - Gavin Brown? - Oh, that ain't his name. What? What do you mean? His name is Wesley Sherman. - Are you sure? - Yeah. I'm sure. Known him since middle school. That boy has always been up to no good. I never liked him. He's always just a big bully. Did you know him, too? I might have known his father. Yeah, he wasn't so nice either. He was an ex-cop. Word around town is he was killed in the line of duty. Did you-- did you know him? No, I guess I didn't. How do I find Wesley Sherman? I think he lives alone on a ranch out towards Sweet, right at the intersection of Highway 52 and the Sweet Ola Highway, you can't miss it. - Ain't nothing else out there. - Thanks. Hey, ma'am? Be careful out there. That boy has got lots of guns. He's also got my little girl. ( chuckles ) - Hey. - Come on. Aww. I'm so excited. After you. * Abbey?! Abbey?! Abbey?! Abbey! Abbey! ( cell phone chimes ) - Julia? - Martin. Hey, I still haven't found anything. Did Wesley Sherman have a son? I don't know. I think he had a few children, why? Did he name his oldest son Wesley Jr.? Honestly, that case has been so long ago, but, yeah, I remember something like that, why? This is going to sound crazy, but I think Wesley Jr. killed Lucas, and I think he's got Abbey. Bingo, there's a Wesley Sherman Jr. at 3003 Castillo Road over in Prescott. That's on the other side of Prescott, damn it. Thanks, bye. Who was that? It was a buddy of mine. He wanted to know if I wanted to go out tonight, but I told him I had much better plans. - Hi. - Hey. God, you're beautiful. I can't believe I'm with you right now. Not yet. Not yet. What? - It's too soon. - It's not too soon. I've been waiting for this moment two years. I wanna make love to you. I do. Okay, it's just-- no. I-- I haven't done it before. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I'm gonna be really gentle with you. I-- I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Why don't you stop thinking for a second and just kiss me? Feel the moment... ...and it'll just happen, okay? Trust me, I have a lot of experience here, and I'm gonna make you feel safe. What about protection? - Protection? - Mm-hmm. We don't-- we don't need protection. You can't get pregnant on the first time. - I can't? - No, of course, not. - It's just an old wives tale. - Really? Yes, really. Hey, what about diseases? ( sighs ) - Do you have any diseases? - No. Okay. Neither do I. Can you not destroy the moment? Please be gentle. I will. Hey... this is-- this is-- this is your room? Of course it is. Then who's Wesley? Wesley? Yeah. Yeah. I see the name Wesley all over this room. Yeah. My dad's name was Wesley. Why would your dad's name be all over your room? ( sighs ) Because it is. Is it really that big of a deal? - Plea-- please stop. - Why? Because it's too soon. I don't feel comfortable. Maybe this was a bad idea. No, no, I'm just not ready to have sex yet. Well, if you're not ready to have sex, then you're not ready for a relationship. No, no, just give me some time, okay? I'm a girl. I like to take things slow. There's no rush, Gavin. Okay, just be gentle with me, and I promise in time, we'll make love. I love you. And I don't-- I don't wanna hurt our chances of being together forever. Yeah. Yeah. I'm sorry, I... I just can't believe that you're here right now. Gavin? Where'd you go? Hey. Hey, what time is it? It's 11:00. Wow, I slept for a long time, huh? Guess the drive really exhausted you. Yeah, I'm not used to staying up all night. What are you doing? Just getting a little work done. Why don't you stay asleep a little longer, and I'll be in in a bit. Okay. What are you doing? - Nothing. - Nothing? Going through my wallet isn't nothing. You're dressed. - Yeah, it's cold. - It's cold. Hey, I'm curious about something. - What's that? - About who Wesley is. I already told you, Wesley is my father's name. And then why does your driver's license say Wesley, and why did you text my mother? Do I really gotta point it out to you? You don't have to say anything. But I want you to. I want you to feel like you can be honest with me. - But I am being honest. - You know you're not. Your name's Gavin, and driver's license says Wesley. You know everything about me, and-- and I'm beginning to feel like you're not who you say are. Well, who could I be? I don't know. But you're not Gavin. Okay. You got me. I'm not. Gavin Brown is an alias that I came up with for my Chatter page, all right? I didn't like my old name, so I changed it. I used to be Wesley Sherman, but now I am Gavin. Is there anything wrong with that? What are you hiding from? My past. Okay, after my father was murdered, I was put into foster homes, and I went from foster home to foster home, and I was abused mentally and physically-- Yeah. I'm opening up to you, and you're being so insensitive. Why do you have a letter from the Arizona Department - of Corrections Administration? - Really?! Yeah. Abbey, we all make mistakes, all right? So I made a couple mistakes when I was young. I got in trouble, and now they keep tabs on me. All right? I'm not perfect. We are not perfect. Okay, I know, but I came here thinking one thing, - and now it's changing. - What is changing? I'm the same person that's been messaging you for the last two years. How do I know that? It's just the chance you're gonna have to take. I mean, that's the nature of love. One person falls in love with another, and they end up going out on a ride that they can only hope ends happily. Hey, I love you. And we were meant to be together. Age, name, places, none of that stuff matters. All that matters is that we were two people searching for the same thing, and we found it in each other. Yeah? Just don't push me like that. Or you'll do what? Or I'll have to tell you the truth. The truth about what? I said don't push me. Come on. Okay, look, what are you-- what are you not telling me? Do you have any secrets? Do you have a family that you're not telling me about? Do you have a girlfriend? Are you a murderer? Why did you go to jail? You told me-- you told me that you loved me. Why are you acting like this? Just come here. Come here. ( screams ) Abbey! This is familiar, isn't it? ( screams ) No! No! ( crying ) No! No! No! That was a very nice try, Abbey. Huh? - No. No. - ( cell phone chimes ) Please, please stop. Did you text somebody? - No! - No? Well, then who-- who could that be? Mommy. "Don't worry, sweetie, I will be there soon." Does that comfort you? What's going on?! Who are you?! It's not time yet. What do you-- time for what? It is not time for you to know who I am. But don't worry, pretty soon, you and your mom will know exactly who I am. What the hell are you talking about?! What the hell are you talking about?! Stop! ( cell phone chimes ) Monty, call the police right now and tell them to meet me with a large force at Lincoln Mine. You all right? No, I'm in pursuit of Wesley Sherman. - He's got Abbey. - You got it. Abbey: You killed my father. How could you do something like that? Stupid naive little girl. I've been planning this ever since that day you got away. Do you not remember? Run and hide! Run! Go hide! Run! Run, hide! Hey, you are gonna get us killed! What's the difference? You're gonna kill me anyways. Yeah, well, that was the plan, but now I haven't decided yet. See, now that Mommy's in town, I'm thinking maybe-- maybe I'll kill her and let you live without parents just like I had to. What are you-- what are you talking about? Abbey, you're not paying attention. Your mother murdered my father. What?! What-- Your mother and my father were on the force together. Your mother went rogue and murdered my father. My mom would never do anything like that. No? Then why did she marry Daniel right after your father died? After my father died. You killed him. Finally a little quiet. * ( Abbey whimpering ) Wesley?! Let her go! We don't need to get anybody else involved, okay? I just want my daughter back. Look, I know this is about the revenge of your father's death, but you don't know the truth. He was a good guy. He was my partner, But he let the money get the best of him. He went bad. We were chasing a suspect. FBI! Freeze! * FBI! Stop! Backup's on the way! Make it easy on yourself! - Julia. - You got him? I got him. Put your gun down. Where is he? He's not cuffed, Wesley! - Put down your gun. - The hell are you doing? - We're letting him go. - What are you talking about? - Put down your gun, now! - I'm your superior. I don't take commands from you. Cuff him now, Wesley. I'm sorry, Julia, that's not gonna happen. Shoot her man, she ain't nothing. Calm down. I'm not gonna shoot her. If you don't shoot her, we both go to jail. - There is no other option. - There's an option. Cuff him now. Cuff him now, we'll work it out, okay? - Shoot her, Wesley. - I'm not gonna shoot her. - Shoot her! - I'm not gonna shoot her! Don't do-- The suspect fired his gun! I had no choice. Two of the bullets hit your father. No, not that's not what happened! You killed my husband, you killed the father of my child. How much hurt do you wanna create, Wesley? A world, Julia. I wanna create the same world of hurt that you caused my family the day that you-- that you murdered my father. No, no, I had no choice. You're lying! Damn it. Okay. It's time. No, no. Hi, Mommy. It's okay, baby. It's okay. Come on. Hear that? It's gonna be okay, sweetie. I want you to watch your daughter die. I want you to suffer the way that you made me suffer. We have suffered for ten years. We will suffer for the rest of our lives. - That enough? - Almost. No! Gavin! Please, stop! My name is not Gavin. Have you not been listening? No, no. No, to me, you're Gavin. I know underneath all this rage, you're a beautiful man. Don't be so naive. Gavin was created for the sole purpose of bringing the two - of you here today. - I don't care! All I know is that underneath, that you wouldn't have written all those things if you didn't have a heart. Wesley: Why don't you ask your mother if she had some heart on the day that she killed my father. We can forgive you. My-- my mom and I understand the pain. - You understand the pain? - Yeah. You have to stop this now, Gavin, please. - You care about me. - No, I don't care about you. - You-- you love me. - Oh, no, I don't love you. - You love me! - I do not love you! ( screams ) Baby, help me. You killed my father. You were gonna kill me! - I love you. - Go to hell! ( siren approaching ) - Freeze! FBI! - FBI! - Guys, guns down! - It's over. It's over. Hey. Hey. Are you okay? You got one brave mom. You're not gonna go on any social media for the rest of your life, okay? Julia, you had me worried. Oh, you know, she was brave. No, I mean about my truck. ( laughs ) You're gonna need a new set of wheels for sure. - No bullet holes, but... - Yeah. - It's gonna need a cleanup. - Send me the bill. Yeah, you got it. Gonna leave you guys alone. Thanks, Mom. Good work. Thanks, Mom. Of course. So how are we gonna get my car home? ( laughs ) Your car? Yeah. You're officially grounded, like, till you're 40 years old. Okay. But, Mom, come on. Seriously? After what we just went through? Okay. Okay. I guess you're right. Oh, yeah, I'm right. Yeah. Ah, there's a few people who wanna say hi to you. Thanks, Mom. Honey. - I was worried sick about you. - I'm so sorry, Janelle. I promise I won't do anything to hurt our friendship again. - You promise? - I promise. By the way, Bobby's here. No way, no boys till I'm at least 18. ( laughter ) Julia. Did you catch the bad guy? - I always get the bad guy. - ( laughs ) - We were so worried. - Don't worry about me. I'll always be here for my family. Well, who wants cake and ice cream? - Me. - Me. *
