Jane, smile at the camera. Turn to the right. Face the camera and smile. When I was a kid, I just wanted to be a star. To be famous. To have fans. To have modeling gigs and be on magazine covers. Then I grew up and my dreams grew bigger. I wanted a big house for myself. To marry the man of my dreams. Cut. I wanted to win acting awards, put them all on display. A fabulous rest house for my Mom. You lack focus that's why we finished late. I had so many dreams, I couldn't tell which ones were mine. My dreams became their dreams. Their dreams became mine. I don't know anymore. They all have a piece of my fucking dream. They can have it all. Please. It's all yours. I just want to sleep. Heights? A lot of people are afraid of heights. But tell me one fear that's unique to you. Maybe that fear is being trapped inside a nightmare. Wow. When I was a kid I had this recurring dream that kept haunting me. Interesting. And I really don't want to have it again. Tell us about that dream. More. More! More! More! Actress Jane Ciego was admitted to the emergency room of Asian Doctors Medical Center after an accident on the set of her new film in Quezon City at 4:30 in the morning. According to witnesses, Jane was suspended on a cable rig when a pulley dislodged, causing her to fall 20 feet to the ground. Her head hit a wooden headboard causing more complications. TWO WEEKS LATER Nurse, I'll play it again. The Director's on his way. Just relax. I'll make you feel good. Hey, don't say I'm not taking care of you. I'm not hungry. Jane, you need to recover. People are waiting for you to get better. Who's waiting? All of us. I can't taste anything. Maybe it's normal in your state. Go ahead. Sorry. I wanted to cook Korean for breakfast. I tried but didn't have the right ingredients. Maybe tomorrow. Speaking of people who are waiting. - Mister Lexter, good morning! - Morning, Carlo. - You want to talk to Jane? - Yes, please. It's your Director. Mister Lexter, you're on speaker. Jane? Can you hear me? How are you? It's Lexter, your director. We're all waiting for you. I know you need time, so be strong. You'll get better. We still need to promote the movie, darling. I left a copy of the film with Carlo to inspire you. He knows what to do. Get well soon. I need you back. Babe. Is something burning? Babe, I need to go. Just need you to sign. For equipment at the restaurant. You're leaving me? Lilibeth's here to take care of you. Who? The nurse. So it's going to be very artistic and... atmospheric. Yes. It's a thriller that's high art. Fantastic, isn't it? I'm telling you, we're flying to Cannes. Sounds great, Mister Lexter. I just want to win an acting award with this film. Oh, I'm sure of that. I've done everything. Darling, come here. Take a sip. Oh no! Did it burn your tongue? No. It's cold? It is. So why are you serving cold coffee? Get me another fucking cup. I'm sorry. Oh, darling. It's a groundbreaking role for you. The serious actress in you is underappreciated. I know. It's your first time to produce a movie, so I'll give you the best role you've had in years. We're excited, Mister Lexter! Aren't we? You shouldn't move around. You're the nurse? You're not supposed to go around. You need rest. Beth? Lilibeth? Why? Nothing. What's in that room? The cash isn't enough, babe. The restaurant needs more money. So many expenses. Okay. Are you sure? Because I really don't... I'll give you the money. I don't like this house. Why? Too many corners. All houses have corners. No, I hear things. And the nurse is weird. Nurse, I'll play it again. Just let it run, please. Are you okay, babe? Where's the nurse? Just relax. I'll make you feel good. Where's the nurse? Babe? The TV doesn't work. The computer, too. I can't go online. It's for your own good. Jane, you need to recover. People are waiting for you to get better. Hey, don't say I'm not taking care of you. What the fuck! Babe, what's wrong? Who was that? I'm sorry. Look at this mess. I have to go. Just need you to sign. For equipment at the restaurant. When I was a kid, I just wanted to be a star. Stop listening to that faggot. Just let it play, Mom. It might work. Mister Lexter says... Don't believe Lexter. We trusted him. Jane funded his film. Now look at this whole mess. Calm down. We all want Jane to get better. Let's give it a try. I don't know, Carlo. I'm not comfortable with this, especially with that asshole around. It's not a bad idea. Look, let's just talk outside. Lilibeth? Where are you? Lilibeth! I'm not deaf. I've been calling you for a while. Give me time to walk, Madam. You have a big house. Where have you been? I was fixing something. What kind of nurse are you? You're barely around. Barely around? - What are we paying you for... - Didn't you spill coffee on yourself? You think your clothes just changed by themselves? Sorry. Please buy me a newspaper. A touch of heaven For smooth skin so pure and delicate Around two in the morning, a man found his unconscious daughter being harrassed by a nurse. Maybe the nurse thought I wouldn't be back until morning. When I arrived, the nurse was doing things to my daughter's naked body. I couldn't react immediately so she escaped. According to hospital staff, the nurse had proper certification and had been watching over the patient for two weeks. It happens. As much as we don't want to, it happens. In fact there are cases abroad of nurses sexually abusing patients. And in spite of background checks, it's still easy to fake documents. What do you want? What do you think? What are you doing here? I told you I was going to visit. You can't stay long. Still having money problems? What do you think? How's Jane? The same. Emma, you can't stay here. Then answer my calls. Idiot. Lilibeth? Are you back? Jane? ...about the nurse... Lilibeth! Will you stop yelling? Where the hell were you? I just got back. I'll report you. Do you know who to call? All you celebrities are so spoiled. You're used to other people doing things for you. I'm not your nanny. [ Lady nurse molests female patient ] When someone dreams, the parts of the brain concerned with reasoning and facts shut down. Memories and experience can blend with imagination. In the dream state, your emotions reign. Who? What? She scares me. Babe, aren't you being overly sensitive? I thought you wanted me to get better. Abigail, please. I'm really tired. Who's Abigail? Can we just go to bed? Why do you reek of lotion? Carlo. Carlo. Mommy J, how have you been? Of course, it pains me. Everything that's been happening. She's my only daughter. I personally took care of her. Attended to all her needs since she was a kid. You sound like a good mother. Of course. I try my best. I really try. All the concern, all the sacrifices a mother should make. Have the doctors told you when she'll be well? The movie premieres in September. Cue music. They haven't. But I'm praying to God. Lord, please heal my daughter. I need her, Lord. I hope God listens. I've been good to you, Lord. I've sacrificed a lot for you. Wake up, Lord. Wake up! Babe? Who are you? What's happening? Who the fuck are you? What? Who are you? It's me, Carlo. I'm not stupid. I swear. I'll call the cops. Fuck you. Well it's me, Carlo. Fuck you, too! You're not my husband. Lilibeth! Last night, I arrived late. We fought about the nurse. Then we had sex. What's your problem? Lilibeth. Look, l'm Carlo, your husband. We've been married for three years. I proposed to you in Paris on your birthday. What did you say? While we were at the Eiffel Tower? I said, "It's cold up here, but I hope this will warm your heart." Then I took out the ring. What's happening? You had a nervous breakdown on set. You're recovering now, so we moved to this house. Everything feels strange. You have a scar over here, from an accident on set when you were a kid. When we make love, you only cum when you touch yourself. I don't understand! I can't deal with your shit this early! You're sick. You understand? Fuck! It's probably the medication, that's why you're disoriented. I'll check the dosage with Lilibeth. I hate that nurse. We don't have a choice. Look, I really have to go. Lilibeth will take care of you. But you don't have a job. Abigail? So it's pushing through? Yes. Jane's producing it herself. Fabulous! It's been your dream. It better be a masterpiece. Of course. Feature me on your show. You know how it goes. Of course, darling. International festivals, gosh. Now I'm anxious! Ice. Fill that with ice. You're not joining the local film festival? Oh no, you didn't. So? International festivals. Picture the red carpet. I'm so done with those 20 years of directing the same old soap operas. Finally, I'll get to do what l'm passionate about. Hi, boys! I cannot believe that you're with me, my love. Bored? Where's my cellphone? You don't have one. I have a phone. No, you don't. Am I a prisoner here? Go on. Keep laughing. Calm down, madam. This isn't a soap opera. No need to overact. I'll report you. Who's going to believe a mad woman? How stubborn. Let me out! Madam, don't scream. Get well, Jane. Carlo? Who's there? I need a phone. Carlo? Carlo, please. I want to talk to Mom. Let's stop this Sorry. Please clean that up. All right. Bro! Have a seat. She's asleep. What else is new? What time is it? Five. Look behind you. It's that guy. Is it too early for a drink? Not really. Dude, you know what Jane's mom told me on our wedding day? True story. CARLO AND THE ACTOR She said, "My daughter's out of your league. You just got lucky with Jane but you're not right for her." Can you believe that bitch? You just never got on Mommy J's good side. Not an inch. That's tough. My wife, too. Fuck. What a nag. Cheers to that. I admit, my businesses went bankrupt before we got married. I lost everything. Fuck! But for her to tell me Jane's out of my league, to my face on my wedding day? Damn that old hag. What? - Why are you laughing? - Nothing. Go on. No. Why are you so smug? You already had the money for the business? Yes. And so? You blew it off at the casino. I've admitted that! I fucked up, I fucked up, and I fucked up! Exactly. So stop whining, idiot. Fuck you, dude. I'm no idiot. Sir. The manager's asking if you could take it outside. Just fuck off. Sorry. Smart move. Your manager sends the prettiest waitress. Let's go. Let's go. You take care of the check. Why should I? Don't be a fucking cheap ass. You're loaded. It's just six grand. Just fucking pay for it. Six grand, the hell? How much is it? Just 1,450 pesos. Can you grab my wallet? In my left pocket. - Yup, right there. - He has a huge wallet. Get two thousand. Yes. Then keep the change. Get a card, too. There you go. How come you celebrities don't have life problems? Says who? Dude, my life's a wreck. Carlo! See, I told you it's a wreck. Looks like that's your scene. And I guess this is yours. Just in time. Fucking lucky bastard. Look at those tits. I'm sorry for my friend. Had little too much to drink. Even here? You told me to wait for you outside. I've been here for two hours, idiot. Know what? You're shit. He's shit. You've all been calling me an idiot. I'm not an idiot, okay? Aren't we going to talk? About what? Your responsibilities. Responsibilities? Who do you think you are? Dude, you're just my wife's assistant. What's with the attitude? Because you got me pregnant. Fuck you! Whatever. I don't care about your money problems. Carlo, I need money for the abortion. Or else l'll tell Jane when she recovers. Dance with me. Stop fooling around! I need money for the abortion. My boyfriend will kill me. I salute him. Fucking asshole. Actually, he won't kill you. Right? He's just gonna dump your soon-to-be fat ass. What's happening? I don't know. You were like that when I arrived. Why am I imprisoned in this house? You're not a prisoner, okay? I hear so many things. People laughing. Playful spirits? I'm serious, Carlo. Fine. Lilibeth says the house is haunted. There are spirits roaming around. Carlo. Must be the TV. The internet? The phone? You're sick. Maybe it's all in your head. It reeks of lotion. Is this all just a dream? Just relax. I'll make you feel good. You've been in showbiz since you were 12 years old, right? JANE CIEGO More or less. Excited to try something different? Miss Jane? Of course. Miss Jane, are you okay? I just want to sleep. We're ready for a take. Okay, standby. It's always a great opportunity for us to expand our craft. Okay, roll sound. After all these years of pretty much the same thing, over and over again. So the past 20 years meant nothing? - That's not what I said. - Stop whining. You've made a living out of this. Speed. Lightning. I'm happy that I'm free to do something that can elevate me as an actress. Action! Abigail, please. Joshua, I hate it here. Bliss is a story about Abigail. A star who... has burned out. But played by the still-shining star Jane Ciego. The construction of the rest house isn't done. You can't burn out. And to work with a director who's so kind and a real genius. Set that on fire. My god! I'll get a match. In the film, her mental condition stops her from leaving the house. Unfortunately, it's a haunted house. While her husband and the nurse are conniving against Abigail. Just focus. - You still owe me a vacation in Maldives. - It's Mohl-deeves. I want to go this December. It's your birthday gift for your loving mother. I can say that this is my chance to find myself. You can't leave because you're not yet well. You have no right to do this to me. If not for my money, you'll all be beggars... Cut! Fuck it. Sorry, Mr. Lexter! You know what you did wrong? Yes, Mister Lexter, You wait for the end of Abigail's line. Understood? Understood. Okay. Noel. Yes, Miss Jane. Noel, ten minutes please. Mister Lexter, Miss Jane needs ten. Fine. Okay, boys. 10 minute break. Sorry for that last slap. I got carried away. It's fine. I needed that slap, anyway. When I first read the script, I laughed. It had so many similarities with my life. I noticed. Lexter said the film is not about me though. But at times, I'd fall asleep in my tent and dream about a scene Then I'd wake up unsure if I'm back at work or still dreaming. Oh, no. You need a totem. You're getting Inceptioned. I got so afraid because while studying my character, I recalled a childhood dream In my dream, my Mom came home with a box. She said it was a birthday gift. It was a small box with a lock. She told me it was empty. But I was a curious to see what was inside. I wanted her to give me the key. My Mom wouldn't give it. Then she threw the key to the other end of the room. Of course, I scrammed for the key. I couldn't find it. I nearly cried in frustration. Still, no key. When I looked back at my Mom, she had the key. I approached her, took the key. And then? Shit. Why? I took the key and stabbed her leg, over and over out of frustration. Rock and roll! Yeah, crazy. But you know what was really weird? I kept stabbing and stabbing but she didn't scream even if I knew she was in pain. She just stared at me, smiling. When I got tired of stabbing her, she just gave me the box. I took it to the other end of the room and opened it. What was inside? Nothing. Mom said it was empty, right? Dude, that's crazy. I know. That's why I'm anxious about this film. I kept having that dream as I grew up. It was so frustrating that I made it a habit to forget my dreams in the morning. I didn't want to ever dream again. I just need you to sign. For equipment at the restaurant. Come on. Jane? Mom? Darling. Mom? Mom, where are you? How are you doing? Are they taking good care of you? Mom, I hate it here. Please, get me out. Sorry I just... Take me away from here, please. What is this? Hey, give me the charger! Give it back! You've really gone mad. Lilibeth, give it to me. Just give it back. Lilibeth! Why'd you take my phone? Why did you take it? Answer me! I want to leave this house. You're saying you don't trust me? I don't. Joshua, I want my mother! Let me go. I don't. I want my mother, Carlo. Let me go. You can't leave because you're not yet well. Fuck! You can't do this to me. If not for my money, you'll all be beggars... You're being paranoid, Abigail. Everyone in this house puts up with your daily dose of crazy shit. Come on! I'm not crazy. Lilibeth tells me you throw things around, you scream a lot. You even hit yourself with a vase. I'm not crazy. You all want to kill me. The other day, you woke up and couldn't recognize me. I'm your husband, Joshua. Stay away from me, please. I swear, I'll call the cops. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, okay? I love you. Send her away. Just let her be. - She's watching. - Just focus on me. No. - I don't like this, Carlo. - We're just trying something... I don't care. We don't know what's going on in her mind. You might be giving her nightmares. Carlo, are you listening? Yes. You're the one who's always here. But I'm still Jane's mother. Remember that. I haven't forgotten. The police have released a photo of the nurse who molested an unconscious patient at St. Frederick's Medical Center last week. According to staff records, the suspect's name is Rose Madlangbayan. 28 years old. A registered nurse. What are you doing? When I got to the room, my daughter was naked and the nurse was doing things to her. Mic! Fuck! You all want to rot here? Fix those cables. And those lights, Gerry. Please, this isn't a romantic comedy! Enough of this stupidity. It's almost five in the morning. Boys, double time. Let's finish this. And you, Noel. Disappointment is an overrated word for you! Thank you, Mister Lexter. Gerry, are we set? Art department, fix the props. Are they filming? Jane Ciego's the lead. Looks like a horror flick. Where is she? There! The smoke machine? We've been waiting for that fucking smoke machine. We need more wind machines. Wake up, animals! Let's get this over with. Miss Jane, will you please sign? Of course. Mister Lexter's gone ballistic. Let him be. It's almost morning. It's nothing. Only for you. Forget the smoke, we'll add it in post! Miss, you want a selfie instead? Miss? What's taking you bastards so long? Let's go. My god, this is such a nightmare! Actress Jane Ciego was admitted ROSE MADLANGBAYAN to the emergency room of Asian Doctors Medical Center after an accident on the set of her new film in Quezon City at 4:30 in the morning. According to witnesses, Jane was suspended on a cable rig when a pulley dislodged, causing her to fall 20 feet to the ground. Her head hit a wooden headboard prop causing more complications and left her unconscious. I don't want to wake up alone anymore. Wonderful! Thank you! Next. Next. What's your name, darling? Rose. How old are you? Rose, can you hear me? Hello? Rose, can you sing? Never mind. Next! You're really useless. Just like your father. Hi, Rose. I'm Ling, your neighbor.

Come with me. Round and round... After all these years of pretty much the same thing, over and over again. I think this is my chance to find myself. Fuck. This again. What are you doing here? I get it now. Are we on the set of a horror movie? If the director shouts "Cut!" will you disappear? Mister Lexter? Yeah, she's here. Just a moment. Jane? Can you hear me? When will you get better, darling? Mister Lexter! We all need you. We're almost done editing the movie and we still have to promote. Mister Lexter! Just cut it already. Everyone's crazy around here.

[ Fuck you! ♥ ] My actress is sick. She's the only one who can promote the movie. Her wretched Mom is not releasing any funds. Tell the fucking distributor. I'll slash my wrists in front of him if he drops my film. Mom? Jane. Mom. How are you, darling? Mom! Every morning I wake up wanting to wake up again. I'm trapped in this house. I'm just here, darling. I just wanted to do something different to excite me. Why did it turn out this way? Please take me with you. I know you're suffering but you need to pull through. I took care of your career since you were a kid. You can't just give up. I don't know anything else. You're all that I know. - Think of your Mom. - Are you listening to me? Son of a bitch! Oh, shit. Did he visit? Was he around? Stop whatever you're doing. Mom. Don't you call me Mom. Fine, Aunt. Not even Aunt, damn it. - We're just trying to help her. - I don't care. I'm exhausted going back and forth from the rest house and I arrive to this. l'll be back, Carlo. If I see that...son of a bitch! Come. I'll put lotion on you. Round and round. Does it feel good? There. You'll smell really good! Ticklish? Yes. Just relax. I'll make you feel good. Don't tell your Mom or Dad. This is our secret. Can we play again tomorrow, please? Of course. You're special to me. Very special. I told you, - we'll wait for her to... - I can't wait. What if it takes her six months to recover? What if it takes a year? What if she doesn't? Please. I said wait. She won't get better, Carlo. Emma, what do you want me to do? Maybe you're... Maybe what? Maybe you're in her will? Wait. Are you suggesting that I kill her? You're insane. If you want her dead, kill her yourself. Idiot! How did your Mom get in here? Am I not allowed to see my Mom? Who do you think you are? How did she get in? We're just trying to protect you. You know your Mom. Tomorrow, she'll drag the press here and make it all about her suffering. Do you want that? Now think. How did she get in? I can't remember! Is this all a dream? There. Still dreaming? Joshua, please. Stop it. There's nothing left to take from me. Just let me go. Abigail. Abigail. Babe, I'm sorry. Please wake me up. Can anyone hear me? Wake me up. I need you. I hate you. Stop it! Don't! Don't. Please don't. I can't take it anymore. Please stop. I can't... No! When are you going to wake up? Jane? Jane. Can you hear me? Just kill me. Darling, good news. We've completed our film. I'll leave a copy with Carlo. - This will inspire you, love. - Carlo? - I have a surprise for you tomorrow. - Jane? Joshua? Abigail. - If Mommy J sees that again, I'm so fucked. - Let her be. I know what I'm doing. You have to go. I'll be back tomorrow. - Not tomorrow. -I have a surprise for Jane. Mommy J's dropping by. Not tomorrow, please. I don't care about that woman. - I have the right to talk to my producer. - Please, Mister Lexter. We are making a very important film. Yeah, I know. Fucking Cannes, right? Okay. I'll be back tomorrow. Вye! Don't stay away I don't want to lose... I cannot believe that you're with me, my love. Does it hurt? If you weren't so stupid. See this? You want to kill us? Can you? Madam, for your information. It's up to us who lives and who dies. I convinced your husband to keep you alive. We still need your money. Calm down. In the film, she's mentally disturbed. Unfortunately, she's trapped in a haunted house. While her husband and the nurse are conniving against Abigail. Her soul has been sucked dry. So there's a conspiracy? Yes. And the house is haunted? Yes. What do the husband and the nurse plan to do with Jane? Well, they're after Abigail's money. That's complicated. Well... Carlo? Carlo? Why is the title Bliss? It's my homage to the film Misery, which is so close to my heart. Hi, Mister Lexter. Oh, Jane. What do we do? Show yourselves! I can hear you! But it is also a play on the phrase: Ignorance is... Bliss. Yes. But I also pay tribute to the movies we enjoyed in the 1960's. You just revealed our age. I was kidding. Like I said, don't be afraid of Jane's mother. Assert yourself. You are Jane's husband. Carlo? Please come out. I don't want to complicate things with Mommy J. Shut up. Mister Lexter, I can't take it anymore. She has to wake up. This fucking coma. Coma? Jane? Jane? Can you hear me? Wake up. Jane. Wake up already. My god, this is such a nightmare! Mister Lexter, the crew's exhausted. Two guys fainted. Old Hernan's in the hospital. The hag's acting up again. We've been filming for 30 hours. I'll make it 35 if you don't keep up. Mister Lexter, check the frame? You don't know what you're doing, do you? Damn it! How will I go to Cannes? You can't even frame properly. I'll show you, Gerry. There. You're useless. Let the second assistant director take over. He's asleep. Then wake him up, damn it. Stressing over Cannes. As if they'd take this piece of crap. I hope this is all worth it. What do you mean? This production's all on me. Mister Lexter's won awards for his soap operas. I'm sure this will turn out great. That's all I want. To get awards. Madam? Why? Running through your lines again? We already shot that scene yesterday. Burned out? Are you okay? Where's Jane? I'll take this inside. Carlo. What is it? We need to talk. About what? About what happened. It's over. What's done is done. We don't need to talk about anything. Just like that? We fuck then go back to work. I love it when you talk dirty. It's fucking hot. But seriously, you're no victim, you also wanted it. We're adults. I wasn't the one who kept asking for more. And more. Fuck you. You're welcome. Mom, I'm sorry. That's for you. I don't know what l'm doing anymore. Let's do this. Oh, no. He's about to explode. What matters is that you're happy. I just want to sleep. Don't you want this shoot to end? We do, Madam. - Let's go. - Hold on. Faster. Noel, didn't I send you home? Mister Lexter. The second assistant director is already dead. He's at the funeral parlor. Damn it. Quickly then. My patience is spent. Fuck! Sound. - Hey. - Rolling. Camera. Rolling! Wind effect. Lightning. Who the fuck is sleeping on my set? Who the fuck is that? I'm going to kill you. You're in the frame. - I'll kill him myself. - Noel says we're good to go. We're good. Let's take this. Fix that cable! We're still rolling. Remember, Jane. This is the climax. You've been possessed. They're taking your soul. Give it everything. Take One. Action! Lift. Higher. More movement! They're taking your soul. Resist. More. More! They're sucking your soul dry! More! More! Jane! When I was a kid, I just wanted to be a star. I had so many dreams, I couldn't tell which ones were mine. What if the people meant to care for you really want to kill you? I'm not crazy. Andromeda Pictures proudly presents Jane Ciego in a groundbreaking thriller. The other day, you woke up and couldn't recognize me. I'm your husband. Joshua. I'm not crazy. You all want to kill me. Directed by the visionary Lexter Palao. Wasn't that spectacular? Congrats. Did you hear that, Jane? You should be proud. We're going to Cannes. We really have to go. I know. In the meantime, here's the final version of our film. Carlo knows what to do. Listen to it. You might finally be inspired to wake up. Sir, you can't smoke here. Fine, I'll go ahead. Just play it again. Does this really work? We've been doing this for days. There are cases of comatose patients who can hear their surroundings. So they need to hear something inspiring for them to get better. It's called Locked-In Syndrome. Jeez. Am I the only one here who reads? And what could be more inspiring than her greatest film? Here. That again? Just fucking play it. Let's do what he wants. Just relax. I'll make you feel good. Round and round... When I was a kid, I just wanted to be a star. To be famous. To have fans. Can you hail a cab? Mister Lexter. I'll be back. What are you doing here? Got a problem? My daughter's asleep. You can't take any more money. That's our offer for the interview. Should be enough. Can we go higher? With what you told us... I can spill more. Everyone's just using Jane. I decide how that money's spent. Decide? Are you a manager? Yes I am. No wonder her career's gone nowhere. If she got a real manager, she'd be the biggest star. Excuse me. My daughter's a star. This is your first film. So don't give me that attitude. You shameless fag! Greedy! Me? You're the one clinging to her! Holding your hand through this journey... Look how this stage mother talks. Everyone knows you manipulated Jane's life to make yourself rich Mommy J, stop... - Mommy J, stop... - Truth hurts? Fuck! You're just like him. Emma called. You got her pregnant. You're a useless husband! You're nothing without my daughter's money. You're just using Jane! Damn you all! I'm moving Jane out of this hospital next week! Take that deranged woman and sedate her! She won't wake up with you around! Fucking leeches!
