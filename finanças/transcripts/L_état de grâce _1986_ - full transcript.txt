Students graduating from universities certainly have diplomas, but they are not fit to work in companies. Universities must train officers in economic warfare. Not intellectuals and talking heads. CNPF UNIVERSITY AND ROBOTICS Only then will we be victorious. With or against you. Please. The Secretary of State for Universities, Mr. Antoine Lombard, has the floor. Ladies and gentlemen, I expected an objective presentation, I heard an indictment. I'll therefore take up point by point and without any polemical spirit your spokesman's argument. Excuse me. I was against this invitation and I said so. If you don't stop this childish provocation, I'll walk out now. I hope, ladies and gentlemen, that the news of the day is good for you, but also for the government I have the honor to be part of. Law four on the renovation of higher education aims to set up an organization in accordance with our national traditions and the will to modernize the country. Sir. You could have thanked me. I think I would have gotten away with it like a big boy, I've seen worse, you know. You embody everything I hate. Touch me. Here. Antoine. Antoine. Antoine, it's seven o'clock. I'm late, then. No. I said no! Oh, you're crazy. That's enough. This girl hurt me, and now she's having a laugh! I know, my love. Me too. I heard you dream tonight. Really? What did I say? You said, - "I've never been so in love." - But it's true. Florence, you know I'm late. You're welcome. What's this? -Secret -Really? Who is waiting for whom? Let's go. - Do you remember your promise? - Of course. - The secret? - Swear first. I swear to be free for three days. - Promise? - Yes. The 23rd, 24th, 25th. Repeat. The 23rd, the 24th, the 25th. - Why those days? - I don't know. - Neither do I. - I only met you three months ago. - Here. - Ah yes. "You embody everything I hate." Florence to Florence. With whom? With Antoine. Antoine and Florence will go to Florence. And when? The 23rd, 24th, 25th. I swear. - Bye, Dad. - Bye, kids. - Lo-Louis, be careful with your sweater. - Sorry. - Good morning, Mom. - Good morning, my loves. You guys did it all alone this morning. You're beautiful. Give me a kiss. Always late. I'm hurrying. - Bye, Mom. - Bye. Here, take this. Put it in your factory. Don't forget Wednesday's meeting. I'll be there, Mom. You'll address the laity. - You're not afraid, at least. - I promise. It's all hands on deck, Florence. - Hello. - Hello. Claude, as usual, drop the lady off first. FREE THE SCHOOL Judith got the best grade in her class again. It's going to end badly. Antoine Lombard, what do you think of emotion winning public opinion over politics… Campaign conducted by the opposition newspapers against the government, against secular schools… - Are you enjoying it? - I'm interested. School must be open to all children, whatever their skin color, their social background. It is always in the name of freedom that liberties come under assault. The public school is the school of liberty. The government wants an agreement with employers. Minister, there are whispers that you don't agree. But the government hasn't changed its policy, and nor have I. Business leaders are involved in the preparation of my law. But the university will never be handed over to the reins of profit. Profit. That's a word you don't like very much. - Is that a question? - Of course. We live in a society dominated by profit, so I have to work with that. However, employers reject the way students - are framing them. - You info is wrong, Pierre-Julien. Some bosses want the university to change its programs to fit their immediate needs. I say no to that. Imagine if a diploma were valid in Lille, but not in Paris, not in Grenoble, not in Lyon. No. The university must deliver national diplomas that are valid nationally. We're training free men, - not robots. - And the law, when? I'll submit my copy to the government in a month. If it gets a majority, which I hope it will, the law will be discussed and voted on before the session end. - A conclusion, Mr. Minister? - I just gave you it. Thank you, Antoine Lombard. Tomorrow we will speak with Simone Veil. You're preaching the gospel to me. The pink gospel. You ask me questions, I answer. You've not changed, have you? You were already like it at uni. That's right, I haven't changed. Oh well, you make me… Don't lecture me. If you're looking for a doormat, excuse me, I'm a journalist. - Did you get out of bed the wrong side? - No. - No. - You were funny. - Two coffees. - With a glass of water, please. Me too, please. A short sentence. - The ones that win big cases. - Let me see. Mr. Julien, telephone. Hello, Peter? - Yes? - You could have said. Oh no, Veronique, please. - Who have you been screwing again? - I screw who I want, you see. - You're not shy. - Bastard. Get out of here. - You're a cow. - Look in the mirror. Crisis? - It's Veronique. - Do you want me to see her? - Will you find the time? - Of course. Hi, Pierre. Next time, be careful, don't forget that you are talking to a minister of the Republic. A real bitch. Here. Find him for me. But then pass him to me. Think this is the day? So, Weber. Ready for the game? You're the one playing, ma'am. Yes. We will win. - Tokini confirmed. - What, Tokini? The meeting in Tokyo on the 23rd. On the 23rd? No, I can't. - That's impossible. - You'll go without me. Ma'am, I committed a long time ago. I said no. And you'll be a hit with the geishas. SECRETARY OF STATE FOR UNIVERSITIES Thursday the 16th at 9:30 a.m., hearing of the unions, SNESUP, UNEF, CGT-FO, CFDT. At 1 p.m., interministerial meeting at Matignon. Saturday 18th, 10 a.m., signing of the sport-university agreement at the Ministry of Sports, then lunch. No, that's okay, I know it. Let's move on to the next week. I need - three days after the 23rd. - Three days? Come on, Sylvie. Do it for me. Ah, Friday 23rd, meeting in Marseille. No, but I'll work it out with them. Well, afterwards. After, it's the weekend. - For once you can give it to me. - No. - How so, no? - No. Saturday 24th French-speaking Africa conference. You chair the college committee with your colleague, Pierre Mournet. And in the evening, a gala evening put on by the President, attendance required, tuxedo, - Mr. Minister. - The bastards. Yes. Oh well, I found it. Two days next month. - But not two days in a row. - Are you kidding me? I need them, Sylvie. I promised. I promised. "Promised." Promised whom, sir? Hello, Antoine. Hi, shall we go? Three days. - There's a guy from the Élysée. - Who asked him? - The Élysée. - Who is it? Bichkov. Let's go. Hello. - Hello. - Hello. -Minister -Hello, Lambert. So shall we get to it? With Youth and Sports it's no problem. You guys are amazing at Health. It is now that you discover that my projects don't fit with your forecasts. Well, no. Bichkov, advisor to the President. Good morning, sir. You want to make the selection worse, right? Not at all, Mr. Minister. - What does the money say? - It's blocked. Totally blocked. Don't exaggerate. Am I exaggerating? For scholarships, 45% less on rates. The recruitment plan for lecturers, no budget. As for the construction of the cafeteria, zilch. Yes, the students will have to eat at MacDonald's. Are you committing your minister? Not on the comments, on the numbers, yes. Your proposals, Mr. Bichkov? I'm taking notes. - I'll report back. - That's fine. No, it's perfect, all of it. Note this, Mr. Bichkov. 11:17 a.m., the representative of the Élysée was asked by the Minister to leave the room. - Excuse me, sir? - Did you get that, Mr. Bichkov? I know, I'll report to you. -Good, Robert -Minister. I want a statement of conclusions. Everyone will state their position in writing. Then I'll personally solve the problems -with the relevant ministers -Very well. The senior officials are here. You're here to implement policy decisions, not to put obstacles in our way. Is that clear? - What, Nathalie? - Mr. Grimm is here. So let's stop dragging our feet, for goodness sake. Ladies and gentlemen, good work. Let's go. - Bye, Robert. - Bye, sir. - His name? - Grimm. Grimm, I apologize for the delay. A ministerial problem. One more, gentlemen, please. This is the institute's core. This is a unique achievement in Europe. - Mr. Lopez? - Yes. All the information about the humanities is in there. We're connected to our colleagues in Frankfurt via satellite. The hardware is French but the software is German. Minister. I would like to know about the work on epistemology of the last ten years. I'll pick one at random. "Epistemology, Social Criticism and Materialism. 1978 State Thesis, Faculty of Orleans. Author, Mr. Antoine Lombard." "With the congratulations of the jury." This is a set-up. You're proposing the great leap forward. Eleven times out of ten, you end up on your ass. I'm not for it. Cornier? The more I think, the less I understand. You have made this company the leading French company. 116% profit, what's better? I have always voted with you, but now I don't understand. President, you're proposing to acquire three companies. Good. Let's start with Sotec. Let's say, Sotec and Frimage. And we'll see. The world wasn't made in a day. The operation calls for 160 million investment. Put half of it on the table and you get my vote. A hundred and sixty million, for crying out loud. Lambert, calm down. It's not all or nothing. It's debatable. MAKE A COMPROMISE. F Florence? It's your turn. But your position, Florian? After you. I'm older. I expected some opposition, but not as much. No. Not from everyone. No, Cornier is right. To be the first company in France in the sporting goods market, forty million in pre-tax profits, not including cash flow, what do the people want? The people want risk, adventure. In France, Lambert, each year we'd get one or two percentage points more, that's all. Rents. What I propose to you is the open sea, a direct attack on the American market. What I want is to become a group with a global reach. The IPO, dear Gruber, of our company, it is not a goal for me. It's a starting point. "But the capital," Lambert repeats. I'm dining with Wells tonight. I have already begun negotiating with him. I know, it's abnormal, but normality… Wells is ready to come onboard with me, for 40% of the 160 million. That's it. There will be no compromise. If I am outvoted, I'll step down as president. - So? - It's me. Can't do it, there's something vital, an international conference, I must go. - But, three days, Antoine! - I know. Listen, I even canceled a meeting in Marseille. And I canceled a trip, don't you care? The president will be there, - I can't. - Just sleep with the president. But our equivalencies, Minister? The Europe of gifts, okay, but diplomas? They don't care but we do. How long will it take? I can tell you this is my pet project. - Autograph, Mr. Minister. - No, not me. Excuse me. With Wells or without Wells, the operation is perilous. You've convinced us of that, Florence. The open sea, adventure, these kinds of terms have little to do with business. You've convinced us of that. The open sea, adventure, all terms that have little to do with the business world. Two of the three companies you want to absorb are lame ducks. Weber knows how to prepare files and I know how to read them. So if you quit I'll do the same. I have been working with you six years and I'm past the age of infidelity. Okay, gentlemen, we'll take a vote. Just a second, Florian. Are you voting for the project? - Yes. - Wait. Madam Chair, if you fail, your shares will pass into our hands? Okay. You're too heavy. Here. It's odd, feels like the end of the world, but it's… - It's… - Ten minutes from Paris. - Oh yes, ten minutes. - Oh, yes. - It's… - I'll be right back. Yes, please. You cut him off. I clearly thought of something else. Yes, really. Would you like a glass of champagne? Thank you. Here, come on. So, dear friend. Ah, here's Florence. Good evening, everyone. - Evening, Florence. - Evening. How are you? Very good. Ah, Mr. Steven. I was told you were tough in business. So I'll take care of you. - No, Florence. - Evening. - I demand to be the first. - Wells. - I have a lot to tell you. - I hope so. I'm going to try this operation. I want our products near the top of the range… I warned you, Elliot. Don't complain. Come on. With the dollar at ten francs, I'm giving you an excellent deal. It is Europe that finances your deficit, which boosts your poor currency. But at what pace will the acquisitions be made? For Sotec and Frimage, it's simple. Greg is a bigger piece. And that's where I need your help. Did you get a majority? Did you doubt me? Florence, I think we should sit down now. When can we make it happen? Come to Chicago next week, okay? My wife will make you her ketchup chicken again. Madame is eating dollars. Come on, Paul, cheer up, go on. Dream on, Wells. I see, you're a born saleswoman, Florence. Jean-Marc says so. Madame is served. Dear friends, if you'd like to sit down to eat. It depends for whom, Florence. In your country taxes are going down, profits are going up. But we have the left in government. Fine, but there's no strike. It's time to go. - Thanks, Florence, that was great. - That's me. See you in Chicago next week. - Goodbye, Jean-Marc. - Goodbye, dear friend. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Evening Jean-Pierre. - Evening. Florence? Florence? Antoine! - But what is this? - It's me. But your dinner? - And your promise? - Oh, no. You're not doing that again. - I really did everything I could. - You think? I can't just cancel an international conference. Why not? Because I'm Secretary of State, not James Bond. Please. Oh, Florence. Your dress is beautiful. You care about dresses now? - Is the car yours? - Yes. I chose the color to please you. Red. I love you, Antoine. And I don't. This morning, in a speech, instead of saying, "France thinks that", I said, "Florence thinks that." Damn, my train. That was the last one. Good. No, not like this. I don't want to. Not like this. What's going on? It just so happens that I am fed up. Tired of these clandestine meetings, I'm tired of this secrecy, I'm tired of your studio. How many guys were there before me in that studio? In Florence we were free for three days. Yes, but so what? What next? What next? Here we go again. - Yes. - But yes, what? Yes, it was only ever that. Yes, that's my point. No. We're hiding because of who we both are. No, Florence. We're hiding because you asked me to. Because of your name, your husband, your money. No, but there's you, Antoine, you. - No. - Yes, you. When you were on the radio today I felt like you were talking to me. Champagne, sports car. How do I look? Like a beloved man, Antoine. Iron to work with Lead for revenge And bread for his brothers Long live the sound of the cannon Ah! that will do, that will do The aristocrats The aristocrats will be hanged What does the Republican need? What does the Republican need? Iron, lead and bread Iron, lead and bread Iron to work with Lead for revenge And bread for his brothers Long live the sound of the cannon… Bravo, it's not bad but now you are… No, wait. There were some mistakes in the text. Dad, it's "also." No. - Say, Antoine. - Yes? You won't back down on schools? Because if we give in to the priests, it's over. Yes, Dad. Here we go again. I'm speaking as a voter, not as an activist. And no voters, no elected members. You too, now? Dad, stop bothering the prodigal son. Voters need only behave, vote and shut up. Come on, let's have a serious talk. Tell him what to do or he'll never get it done. He's lost weight again. Just like you. Are you not eating in Paris? I ordered a leg of lamb. What do you think? So, how goes it at the Council of Ministers? You know I only go when a file's on the agenda but I already told you that, didn't I, Dad? They'd should ask you more often, they'd make fewer errors. -Morning, Minister -Morning, ma'am. At the federation they say you can't wait. Let them talk. Got a lot of work? And do you go out often in Paris? What exactly do you want to know? I don't know, you're not talkative. And what is power like? When will you invite me to your ministry? Soon, Dad. So, tell me, how's it going? I'm not done writing. Still, tell me about it. Angèle. It's the story of two women who met. And? The rest, next week, like on TV. Got a title yet? - Strange Love. - Who are they in love with? Each other. FRANCE FOR THE FRENCH ARABS OUT We keep erasing it, but they do it again. Here's comrade Lombard! Hello, comrade. Hello. - Hello, comrade. - Hello. This is my daughter. I think we'll have a second drink. Posters. Would you like a drink, Mr. Minister? Good morning, Mr. Minister. - How are you? - Very well, thank you. Good morning, Mr. Minister. - I'd like to talk to you. - Yes, no problem. - Hello. - Nice to meet you. Please accept this flower from our garden, Minister. Yes. Thank you. What is your name? - Marguerite. - Thank you, Marguerite. The more time passes, the more people are laid off. We should remember that since the liberation, this is the first time we've really been in power, and that everything… Wait. It must all be modernized. But every time we modernize the employees suffer. - That's not why we campaigned. - I understand. But just because we have power doesn't mean bosses have lost it. Economic realities must be taken into account. Mr. Seán MacBride is here. Carlos Fuentes, the widows of Pablo Neruda. and Salavador Allende are also here. And here comes François Mitterrand outside the Pantheon, where there are the most people on both sides of the rue Soufflot, the street that bears the architect's name who began the construction of this Pantheon under the reign of Louis XV, construction that was completed by Rondelet. This Pantheon that Victor Hugo, who was to become one of its residents, referred to as a gigantic cake. François Mitterrand is going to cross. the nave of what was first the church of Saint Geneviève, before - it was renamed in the Revolution… - Ah, nice. …and became the Pantheon… It's like a movie club, it's like an old movie. France is, as the inscription above the colonnade states, a grateful nation to great men. What are you reading? Is it good? It's like Tolstoy. How is your project going? Films move forward like trains in the night. Truffaut said that. But the trains still have to start. Ah, the materialist comeback. If you can't find the money, change the script. Tell the same story, but take into account what the producers want. Write a crime story. Your film was beautiful, but nobody saw it. Shut up. If you're asked to change your mind, - do you? - No. But cinema isn't the same thing. Yes, it's a hobby before a job. Stop being a big brother, it doesn't suit you. Yeah, they were trying to get me. Kindly, but still. Know what he did? He gave me a letter of credit for nine million dollars. And I was paying interest. - Give me a ride. - No. Goodbye, children. Goodbye, Rose. Let's go. At your last national convention, period. The law will ensure your student union not only access to all university records, comma, - but also… - Bichkov's report was spicy. - I could care less. - Here. No, I don't want to. I don't want to. Where were we now? "Access to all academic records, comma, "but also". You threw him out, Bishkov? Yes. - I don't like his face. - It's not his head, but the inside. - The girls and I used to say that. - Did you discuss it? The whole house is talking about it, Minister. Tell me, Sylvie, am I being spied on? No, but let's go. But again, I also confirm to you that the grants included in the budget collective, comma, will be paid, period. Florence. Good evening, Claude, thank you. Florence, I want a divorce. Your little night drives have convinced me, enough is enough. Don't bring up the children. It's over. Good evening. I don't want to. Hear me? I don't want to. I don't need your opinion, I'm telling you my decision. Jean-Marc, I beg you, I love you. Please. But I've never lied to you. I've never lied. - I hid nothing. - Yes, it's me breaking the contract. No! Jean-Marc, listen to me. - Listen to me. - You think about him all the time. But there is you. I need you, Jean-Marc. - I need you. - It's too easy. Don't leave. At the meeting without Florian I was done. He's the one who saved my skin. I need you. Give me some time. Him for love, me for business, right? It's despicable. You want it all. No, give me time, I beg you, give me time. Help me. You disgust me. Understand? You disgust me. - Okay, it's ready. - Let's eat. Here we go. - A little wine? - Please. Your problem with Veronique, is that you want to continue to cheat on her but don't accept she does. We're no longer in the Middle Ages. Please, tell me more. - I don't know whose side you're on. - No. But that has nothing to do with it. A guy who loves a woman has only one desire, to live with her. See her, listen to her, smell her, wake up with her, eat with her, cook with her, argue with her, I don't know. I don't know. Everything. It's not sex on the one hand and the heart on the other. Love cannot be divided. A couple, it's a couple. Are you in love? - Yes. - With an activist? - Not exactly. - Wow. When do we find out? So you're marrying? I see. Yeah. Give us a great year. And here is Pierre-Julien who finally has his socialist side. - A little Martel. - Yeah. That's great. It's crazy. Knowing you're in love. And I thought you only had one love: France. Good evening. What's wrong? - I'm fine. - What is it? Nothing. I'm a little cold. The Yanks must have given me the flu. I'll make you something hot. A tea with rum. - A grog, you know. - Yes. With lots of sugar? Yes. What if I had gotten a large apartment? Not a real house, but big enough for two people to live in. You'll join me when you can. Would you come? Let's lie down. Come on. One more, please. NATIONAL ASSEMBLY My dear Lombard, I need this Institute. Yes, but it's planned elsewhere. For your pals? Dear Buppon, you're constantly bashing me, and when you can, you request exceptions and, of course, subsidies. Come on, try harder. My city deserves a university. An institute, don't exaggerate, Buppon. You know, I don't do clientelism. The Cybernetics Institute hasn't been assigned, I have many possibles. I'll have the regional council's blessing and for the department, no problem, it's me. Dear Minister, you'll be received like a prince. Yes, in session I am insulted, and in the corridors people smile at me. Buppon. - Excuse me for a moment. - Sure. You're amazing, you disappear in the night and pop up… It's over, Antoine. You and me. We're done. - I can take no more. - What's over? You know! I don't want to meet again. Are you kidding? The sky is falling. My children, Jean-Marc. My business. I can't take it anymore. You're trimming your schedule, right? Yes. Anyway, it couldn't go on like this. It would have been one of us. It's perfect. That's what I was hoping. No, you don't have to. I already had the lock changed. Florence. Florence. - So, my dear Minister… - Get lost, you! Hey! Buppon, you're pissing me off. - Sir. - Apologize, Antoine. - I'm sorry. Please accept my apologies. - No way. - Please. - It's a misunderstanding. If ridicule kills, I hope he gets killed. After that, either you go up in the polls, or you go straight to heaven. Okay. En garde! I'm sorry. How far does it go? Until the last machine. You'll see that the workers are very serious. The machines are good for scrap. Got the arrival notice for the material? Yes, ma'am, on the 21st of next month. Good. - And for staff training? - These are very flexible robots. The Japanese told me that staff would master its use in less than eight days. Good. We have to get rid of these machines. Please. Thank you. Anyway, I insist. We need to create quality swords here right now. Yes, the problem is framing. But I hired Bezons factory executives. Good. So the gentleman says we can open up to there. Take it down. - Can we see the rooms? - Please. Go on without me. See you later. What do you think? In a month you'll recognize nothing. Ultra modern. And if I succeed Vannier-Buchet is on the stock market. Can you believe it? Yes. Well, say something! Skim the fat off here. Ms. Vannier, please. Don't worry. What are you doing after? Yes, I just discussed seeing the room next door with the man. We're going to go. Need a lift home? No, I can't. I have more to do. Okay, very well. I really need some sun. But without the kids. You and me. Not so fast, Florence. Okay? I love you, Antoine. But I didn't want to leave Jean-Marc, the children or give up my business. Florence. Don't hate me too much, Antoine. The situation had become unbearable. I couldn't give you everything you wanted. I could no longer cope with our existence. We were all unhappy. I didn't dare speak to you face to face. That's why I came to the Assembly. I love you, Antoine. But I didn't want to leave Jean-Marc, the children or give up my business. Florence. Florence. Don't hate me too much, Antoine. That's why I came to the Assembly. The situation had become unbearable. Forgive me. I love you, Antoine. I love you, Antoine. Well, gentlemen, we're done. Would the minister like to conclude? The sun's coming up. Gentlemen. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, Mr. Minister. Goodbye. Must I beg you? It was all for nothing. - Started smoking again? - No. Spit it out. We're throwing it all away. Are you a dialectician? You see, old man, we've just gone from a state of grace to austerity. And you never wanted to admit that. But the Élysée wants to give in on schools and your bill is a symbol. Your law is done for. And then there's you. You fire Bichkov. Much liked in high places. You play D'Artagnan. And I'm not telling you what they say about you at Matignon. That's not the worst part. You boycott the media. You don't care about polls. You don't communicate. And that comes back to bite you in the ass. You're not fashionable. Your look. And what does the fashionable man advise me? I don't know. Find a compromise. Delay the bill, and then, you can yell. - Shall we go for a coffee? - And you, what do you think? Nothing. I'm going to change my look. Good evening, Sylvie. Good evening, Minister. It's not bad, is it? It's good. - Is it the inter-ministry? - Yes. So can you call the PM? Just his chief of staff. It's still good. It's bigger than you said. It makes you a minister. We'll have to get our friends from the section in here. They'll be happy to see where you work. Yes, of course. Would you like a Ricard? You didn't bring me here to offer me an aperitif? No. No. You know, when we took over, at first we decided to implement the program. You know the result, the franc attacked by international banks, our unsaleable products on the world markets, inflation, unemployment, devaluation. A tough situation. So we had to tighten up. This applies to my ministry as well as to others. Except that I have a small budget. So when you cut a budget that's already small, there isn't much left. By spreading it out over five or six years, my law will be applied. I have to be realistic. Say, Antoine. Are you moving to the right? Not you, not a Lombard. It's all talk. You were elected to carry out specific policies. Now you say you must stage it, can't be done, realism. Say that and you're no longer a socialist, Antoine. What is it? My letter of resignation to the Prime Minister. I wouldn't have written it differently. God, you scared me. That's good. I'm proud of you, Antoine. Better to stay clean, son. - It's not that, Dad. - What is it? I'm unhappy, Dad. I'm unhappy. I'm sorry. That's okay. The bank has gone bankrupt. I'm not a winner. I hate winners. Caution. Turn. Go ahead, keep your distance. Stay in the center. Yeah. Let's start again. Go ahead. Keep your distance. Yeah! Caution. Go ahead, there. It's okay, take it easy. Here. Look at my hand. Perfect. Vannier-Buchet, class for athletes. The horse is better than him. Do it again. Vannier-Buchet, class for athletes. No, it's not right, again. Vannier-Buchet, class for athletes. Cut! That's a lunch break. One hour. Take the lights, and have someone guard the equipment. And don't forget to feed the horse. Change the coals. -Yes -Up to 32. Okay. Hello. Do you want to stand here? A glass of water, please. - Are you having lunch? - No, thank you. Yes? For the shots of the horse, number four or five? Both of them. Was three cut? Yes. I had no idea it was so complex. Neither did I. - Anything else, ma'am? - No, thank you. Thank you, no. And you like it? Tastes like cinema, looks like cinema, but it's not cinema. You handle derision with ease. Derision isn't always derisory. Yes. The agency offered me a list of top directors. I wanted Angèle Lombard. Okay? An unemployed director. Do you know why? - No. - I wanted to buy a minister's sister. Money can buy anything. So I'm commissioning a blockbuster from you. I already have the script. A dirty little prick of a minister steals the wife of a well-educated Protestant banker. The well-educated banker pulls out a dagger and cuts the johnson of the little minister. What do you think? B movies aren't my thing. You'll do it, bitch! Did I hurt you? What do I look like? What do I look like? Like a well-educated Protestant banker. FLORENCE S.M.N. How much do I owe you? Yes. I don't mind, because it's a bit heavy. Where, over there? I recognize nothing now. In December there was snow everywhere. Remember? You see how easy it was to break free. I resigned. Not left enough for my friends and too far left for people like you. - People like me? - Yes, people like you. I wouldn't have resigned. What will you do now? Go back to teaching. I have a Polish friend who lives in Paris with her little daughter, her husband is in jail in Poland. Can't you find something for him? - Listen, Antoine. - Let's not talk about it. What's she like? She's at the end of her rope. Tell her to call me, but it's the last time. I wonder what you'll do when we're all nationalized. Florence and Antoine are in Florence. Antoine. Yes? Yes. Oh, yes. Yes. No, hold on. It's for you. Yes? It's me. Weber. Yes, I get it. I can take the 3 p.m. one. Yes. No, alone. Ask the driver to pick me up at Roissy. See you later, Weber. - Are you leaving? - Yes. I must. - We said three days. - That was before. That was before, Antoine. Before. I came alone, Antoine. To be here alone. You coming wasn't planned. -It was wonderful but unexpected -A parenthesis. A period. A period. Should I call you a cab? Yes. To be competitive, you have to modernize. That means automating. On the other hand, and you know it, your work will be less repetitive, more alive, more engaged. - Not if you get fired. - That's the price. If I hadn't bought it, it'd have shut. Bankruptcy. I have invested more than three billion, that's huge. And I'm taking a big risk, too. We can discuss. The terms of the restructuring plan are negotiable. But not its purpose. Everything is negotiable. Except the essentials. I promised to come and talk with you, and I have. Now it's your turn. Go on, get out of here. Hurry up. Just a bunch of hot air. - Come on, out. - Yeah, good riddance. Here. How does it feel? My dear Pierre-Julien, power makes you crazy, absolute power makes you absolutely crazy. Oh well. And you're happy to leave? You could have said. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, Mr. Minister. What are you going to do? University. Are you stupid or what? A man like you is better than that. Can I talk to you about something? They'll offer you a lot of money. The embassy in Madrid. Secretary of State is just a stepping stone. With Spain in the common market, Madrid is politically more important. What do you mean? I had dinner with the Prime Minister. You're passing messages now? No, he only knows we're friends. No, pay attention. I no longer agree with the government's policy in Paris, how can I defend it in Madrid? Can you see me justifying expelling Basque militants with my comrades? No, forget it. Here, look at him. He was dreaming about it, the dog. - Good morning. - Good morning, Antoine. Jean Meni, my successor. Maubert, my chief of staff. Pierre-Julien, a journalist. - Sir. - We must be careful with him. - Good luck. - Thank you. NO LAYOFFS FACTORY ON STRIKE Still held captive in her factory in La Courneuve by the strike committee. Negotiations have stalled. Mrs. Vannier-Buchet, nicknamed "the iron lady" by the unions is refusing to negotiate. I have just learned that the CNPF has just demanded that Prime Minister release… - Yes, Paul? - Sorry, sir. This was just brought by. - Yes, hello? - It's Florence. Yes, hi, Florence, it's me. Negotiate, Florence. Later, you'll see. - No, but there's nothing to negotiate. - You're not Joan of Arc! - Cool it. - I'm telling you to negotiate. Calm down. Let go, there's a thing named compromise. No, Jean-Marc. It is all fine like this. Just don't let the kids watch TV. Okay? If I give an inch, they'll take a mile. And then what? The government will still act. The riot police are there for a reason. Hello, Jean-Marc? Hi, Jean-Marc, are you there? Yes. Imagine what could happen, Florence. I'm not going to give in. If I give in, that's. I'm done. Yes, they're treating me fine. I miss you. Goodbye. You can't do that, we can't use those methods. Not us. Let her go. If we release her, we have nothing left. She wants our blessing. She has bought three firms. If we have layoffs the others will too. Of course, the occupation, the strike, okay, perfect, that's fine. But holding her hostage is a mistake. It will backfire. The government will intervene. So release her and negotiate. I've worked here for 18 years, I'll never adapt to a new machine. I've never gone on strike, sir. Do you speak for the government? For the party? No, I'm just speaking with you. Are you asking us to be sheared like sheep? - Who let him in? - He said he was coming to support us. Come, you don't belong here. Listen to me, this is absurd. It will backfire. Violence calls for violence. Get out! It will backfire. - Then release her! - Get out. Scum! You're with the bosses. Madeleine, I am proud of your son. - In fact, I'm going to tell him. - Oh no. No, I don't want to hear about politics today. Leave him alone. He needs it. No, not those, Edmond. The blue plates. Do you know this Dreyfus story? I think he was a lieutenant colonel then, it was some time before his death. A journalist comes to interview him, so Dreyfus tells him, "Come up to my place, we'll be more comfortable." They arrive in the hall and the elevator is broken. So Dreyfus apologizes, "We'll take the stairs." "It's been broken for some time." The reporter tells him, "That's unacceptable, you should complain." Dreyfus replies, "You know, me and trials…" It's pretty funny on Dreyfus's part. Well, it's time for the news. What do I have here? The kidnapping of Mrs. Vannier-Buchet ended with a real bang. The vice-president of the CNPF gave in on all demands. A statement? No. Thus ends a conflict likely to worsen the relationship between the government… Antoine. I have another one, another story about Dreyfus. He was at dinner with military personnel after his return from Devil's Island, and at some point, at the end of the dinner, one of the soldiers dropped the word "treason". I'm not here for anyone. Everyone was very embarrassed. Finally a soldier addresses Dreyfus. He tells him, "And you, Colonel" … If Mom sees this, you'll get yelled at. One drop won't kill me. - Can I finish? - Go ahead. Antoine, it's for you. My mother, my father, my sister. - Hello. - Florence. - Hello. - Would you like a drink? No thank you. If you need anything… Come on. I shouldn't have.
