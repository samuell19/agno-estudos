Sit somewhere else. Stop! What are you doing? Chief Muthupandi wants some tea. Send it to his house. Which one? His wife's house or his mistress' house? Which house should I send it to? Little rascal! How long should I wait for my coffee? -It's almost ready. -Be quick! -Sure, sure. -Idiot! Is there no cell phone coverage here? There is only one tower in our village. It was washed away during the floods last year. Nobody has fixed it yet. Sometimes, we get a weak signal from the tower in the neighboring village. We try and utilize it as much as we can. Do you know the way to Krishnaveni's house? Yes, we do. I mean, how do I get there? Why are you looking for her? I want to meet her. Who are you? Why do you care? Hey, she just needs the address. Just tell her. Why are you guys messing around with her? Just tell her. Don't go to her house. You'll find a tree just a few feet away. She'll be sitting under it. You will find your grandma there. Well, I never wanted to come here, but you won't stop pestering me. What is wrong with you? Can't you hear me? Stop making that noise! Are you kidding me? Hey! Who are you? Why are you fighting with that old lady? What's your problem? It's between me and my grandma! Your grandma? She hasn't uttered a word for the past 30 years. Who are you looking for? She is Padmini. Krishnaveni is not here. Looks like someone pranked you. The people from our village tend to do that. They got you with their prank. It's alright! I can drop you if you like. Hop on. Hey, old lady! You can join us as well. Be quick! Come on. Mom, let me play. Please leave. Come on. You heard her. Let her play. Excuse me... come on. Get down. Take the road behind the temple go straight and turn right, you will find a hut... then turn east, you will find a narrow path take a right again and keep walking straight, you will reach the "mourning" Grandma's house. Did you get it? Okay, take care and be safe. Are you a makeup artist? Yes, I am! How did you know? I have seen this makeup kit before. Can you make me look fair with this? How about this "Dirty face"? "Dirty face?" Her name is Rani but Sembian calls her "Dirty face." I want to act in movies as well. But he always tells me that I don't look good. They don't let dark skinned people to act in movies, right? Who told you? Come here. You may keep it. It's okay. Keep it. "Dirty face" is now beautiful! Are you in our village to shoot some movie? I'm here to meet my grandma. Who is your grandma? The "mourning" lady? Do you know her? The whole village knows her. Do you know the way to her house? To her house or directly to her? My father's gone. But he was fine yesterday, wasn't he? He passed away while he was on his way to the play. Be strong and take care of the last rites. -Hey, Amudha! -Yes, Grandma? Is Solamuthu's younger son Rasu here? Nope. I guess, he will be late Some relationships grow stronger with distance and some don't. How long should we wait? We have our work. Grandma, he has to travel a long way. Kamatchi insists that the funeral will commence only after Rasu gets here. On the other hand, Muthiah is furious that Rasu never cared for his father. Alright! Solamuthu's son has to travel a long way, but what's the matter with that brat Kuberan? Useless fellow! I can get on with my work if he reaches on time and applies makeup. He is a busy man. You have to adjust. Merely carrying a makeup kit doesn't make him the king of all makeup artists. My grandma is no less! Hey! Come here! Come here! Sangu, come here! Hold the makeup kit. Be quick! Hello! So sad! Solamuthu passed away. No one cared when he was alive. Stop your crocodile tears now! They are serving food over there. Go! Just go mind your work. What's up, Amudha baby? Is the mourning troupe ready? Call me baby again and I'll break your arms. You look beautiful even when you are angry. Come on, now. Visit me often and I will turn your fair using my makeup skills. Remember, you'll need me to mourn your death! Useless fellow! Don't you worry dude. When you die, I will apply the makeup. What's up old lady? You look angry. Need something to drink? Hey! One chilled drink for the old lady here. Some good souls like Solamuthu lived in our village. But there are many useless pigs roaming around this village as well. We should chase those pigs out of this village. Why are you mumbling? Are you afraid to say it to our face? Look into our eyes and speak. Why would I be scared of you? All you idiots are fools! I will say it to your face. You're all pigs! Hey old lady! You better show some respect to the makeup artists. You don't reach on time and you call yourself a makeup artist? Your grandfather and father were never late. It's because they treated the dead as Gods! Useless fellow! Grandma, why are you wasting your time talking to these idiots? Old lady! Forget it. But remember, I will be the one to apply makeup on your face, when you die. How dare you ask her to shut her up! Can't you see? He is talking your grandma. You think raising your voice will intimidate us? We shave dead bodies. Control yourself and don't mess with us! Get lost! Grandma! Why are you messing with these guys? Stop making a scene at a funeral. Guys, get on with your work. Come on, we'll deal with them later. You just wait and watch. Hey! Shall we start doing the makeup? Useless fellows! They're late and look at their attitude. Bastards! Let's begin. Stop the music. Humans can rule the land and water! -Indeed. -Indeed. Humans can overpower anything and everything. -Anything! -Anything! But one fine day the rule and the power of every human will come to an end. So, that's the theme today.

When Solamuthu performs, it's celebration time for all the beauties He was a unique artist in his own right He was a unique artist in his own right Solamuthu lived a great life. Let's charge more than the usual. Hey! Solamuthu was a master of folk dance. He was an artist like us. It will be a disgrace if we charge for his funeral. This applies to you as well, Bahubali. If I find out that you collected money from his family... I'll bash you up! Got it? Okay. Stop blinking, you fool! When Solamuthu sets foot On the dance floor...

To bathe her once a month... Is a daunting task we used to face We used to face! Now, here she comes Like a maiden from the city Like a maiden from the city She stares at me now as I sing She is staring at me Who dares to stare at you? Exactly! Who has the guts to stare at me? Let me tell you my plight! Let me tell you my plight! Let me introduce myself Let me introduce myself I have set out for Madurai I have set out for Madurai I have come a long way A long way I have no one to take care of me No one to protect me I don't have a place to stay No place to go I am coming here after a long time To Aappanadu after a very long time I am a maiden from the city I belong to the city I grew up in the city The life in the city is all I know I am a pampered child That's how I was raised I have been to many places I have been to many cities And I have achieved a lot in my career I have achieved a lot! I have no one to take care of me No one to protect me I don't have a place to stay No place to go The city I come from, Has well-built roads and pathways It's all weak and half-built roads here! No proper pathways Stop! Stop! This is the girl I saw at Solamuthu's funeral. Why is she waiting outside the old lady's house? Is she a guest? She must be making a pit stop. Why would anyone visit the old lady? Look at her clothes! She is definitely an outsider. I love her skin! Look at how it's glowing. Stop drooling over her fair skin. What about Amudha? Hey! Open the door! Did you call me here to embarrass me? You fool! You're here to meet me, right? Why are you leaving? You are one hotheaded girl from the city! I just got back from a funeral. I can't touch you or talk to you before I take a bath. So, I had a bath, changed clothes and rushed out to welcome you. To hell with your welcome! -Mind your tongue! -Why should I? Grandma, is she a guest? Sangu, don't you recognize her? She is my granddaughter from Chennai. She's Kunjamma! Right! She's no outsider, buddy! Kunjamma, I'm Sangudevan! -Baahubali! Don't you recognize her? -No. She's the one who put her hands in the cow dung when we were children. Who? She is from our own village. She just called you an idiot! Stop showing off that you are from the city. You're the ones who splurge on ripped jeans and you call me an idiot? Wearing torn clothes is the only option I have. But you're choosing to wear ripped jeans. So, drop the attitude! Shut up, you asshole! How dare you talk to my granddaughter like that? Hey, maiden with baskets Is on her way to harvest She is on her way to harvest Leave your baskets for a minute, You beauty! Come, sit and chat with me You beauty! Come on, Let's see what you've got There dries the loin cloth on the rope It blurs my vision! Yes, it blurs my vision! My dear handsome prince, You look so good when you wear it My throat is sore, can we do it later? Your voice can never match her voice. Enough. It's dark already. Your granddaughter is still sleeping. When will she wake up? When are we going to have dinner? I am hungry. Be patient. She has traveled so far and she must be exhausted. -Let her sleep peacefully. -Right! When you were mourning today, did you notice Kamatchi? You are gossiping a lot these days! I think it's time to get her married. Start looking for a groom. A groom? That skinny idiot is already in love with her. Let's get these two married. Who are you talking about? Tell me! Grandma! Stop it! Stop blushing. You continue. He is the sidekick of that monkey Kuberan. It's Sangudevan. Don't link me to that useless fellow! I would rather die single. Finally, she's up! Come on. Come join us. Let her come. Why are you sweating? How do you live without electricity? Don't you people sweat? We are used to it. We have power outage for eight to ten hours every day. We're feeling the heat, because it's summer. Someone who applies makeup in bright and air-conditioned rooms... will never understand the struggle of poor villagers like us. To keep the city's power supply steady, we villagers sacrifice our electricity. Get it? Grandma! Stop being rude. She must be hungry. Do you want something to eat? It's okay. I'm good. What do you mean? I've cooked all this for you! Don't starve. They tell me that it leads to ulcers. Eat. Enough, that's too much. Eat well, dear. You're really skinny. How will I get a groom for a skinny girl like you? Why do you care? Just mind your own business. Grandma, why do you hate happy single people? Why do you envy them? She always does this. She wants me to marry that useless fellow, Sangudevan! Please eat. And you are... Oh, God! I forgot to introduce myself. Grandma! You could have done it, at least. She is Bhakyam. She is very quiet. She replies in monosyllables. Totally silent. This is Mangalam. You can spot her easily, Meera. How? I'm Amudha. I studied till class eight. You chatterbox! Shut up for a while. Let my granddaughter have some food. Okay. Please eat. He was grazing the cattle When he stole the lamb He stole and sold the Ox's urine He stole and sold the Ox's urine He did it so that he could Get drunk at the local wine shop But he had nothing to snack on But the cow dung Hey, shut up! Sangu, let this be your last game. Luck is not on your side today. Try beating him now! Wait and watch, he is gonna win this! Watch out, he is instigating you! Don't fall for it. Listen, over confidence is bad! Stop showing off, just because you've won the last five games. I know you cheat. I seriously think you have extra cards hidden up your ass! Wait until I catch you red handed. Dude, do you think I'm a crook? Why would I cheat to win? I'm clean and honest. If you're not convinced feel free to frisk my ass! Dude, I know you very well. Now, shut up and play! Kubera, why don't you join us for a game? Remember, gambling turns a king into a beggar. You guys continue. You talk as if we're betting millions! We're not gamblers. We're just killing some time. Where are you running? Come here. Haven't I warned you about coming here? Yes, so what? I'll chop your ears off. Now, where's your mom? She is at the temple. By the way, I am here to show you something. What is it? Check out my lips. Wow! Where did you get that? Is that lipstick? Where did you get it? There's a new girl in village. She's the one who gave her the lipstick. What? Who's this girl? She's the "mourning" Grandma's granddaughter. Her name is Meera. Yes, we saw her at Solamuthu's funeral. She came after you left. We met her at old lady's place. What the fuck, Sangu? Don't drag me in this mess. You hold us at knife point for silly matters. And now your girlfriend is here... Call her my girlfriend and I'll break your head! See, that's the reason I didn't tell you earlier. Indeed! I was the one who dropped her here. Is she your girlfriend? Why did you allow her to apply makeup? How many times have I requested you to do it? Did you do it? Not once! That's the reason. I have a million reasons for not doing it. Does that mean you let a third person do it? See this? Listen to me, never speak to her again. Why? Just do as I say! You know what? Her makeup kit is bigger than yours. The size of the makeup kit doesn't matter What matters is the heart of the one who applies it. Got it? You don't have to apply makeup on me ever. Get lost! So, you want to show off? Fine. There was an exhibition in the neighborhood. I had bought a beautiful red dress and these bangles for you. But now that you have a new best friend, why don't you ask her to buy these for you? So, now you need me, right? Fine, give me kiss and you can have it. Marudhu, come on! Hey, watch out! And be safe. Hey, Bahubali... the king gets his respect only when he has his queen by his side. What's wrong with you? What did I do? It's just a proverb. Who cares if the old lady's granddaughter is here? Just stay away from her. Why would I go there? Well buddy, the last time you saw her was 15 years ago. You must be curious to see what she looks like, right? She has grown into a beautiful young woman. She wears ripped jeans and smells like a perfume. She is a makeup artist in the movie industry. Didn't I just tell you that I don't like her? Talk about that old lady or her granddaughter and I'll finish you off! Got it? DISTRICT REGISTRAR'S OFFICE Pitchumani's father and you father were friends. He is quite fond of your grandma. Grandma, how are you? Did you get them something to drink? Let that be. How long should we wait? Please don't mind, Grandma. My wife is ill. And my manager wanted me to finish a report. Hence the delay. This is Meera. How have you been, dear? You look so different. Amudha, looks like she'll give you a run for your money. Shut up or I'll tell your wife about your smoking habit! So, shut up and read the will. 14th day of the Tamil month of Thai, 1991. Location, Aapanur Village. North street, Door 11/3. I Vairavan, am writing this will myself. My son and my daughter-in-law, Illakiya have a daughter Kunjamma aka Meera. As of now, my son is taking really good care of me and my wife. My half acre land and my house, after my death, will go to my deity Karupanna Saamy and I declare this in my will. This is my will. I declare this will with a sound mind and without any coercion. Signed by Thiru Vairavan. It's his will and his last wish. So, I don't want to go against it. But I don't want to abide by it, Pitchu. Fine. What do you want me to do? Legally my son should have inherited all the wealth. But he is no more. Is there a way to transfer my wealth to my granddaughter, while I'm alive? I don't need your property! I won't be taking the wealth with me after I kick the bucket. So what? I am not interested in this old lady's property. Listen to me! You could've told me this over the phone! Do I look greedy to you? Grandma, Meera doesn't want it. Transfer it to the deity Karruppa Saamy as per your husbands wish. You shut the fuck up! You don't get to decide! Did the cat get you tongue? Talk! I'll talk only if you let me, Grandma. You have been doing the talking since we got here. Here, have some tea. Please stop grumbling. Amudha, mere consent isn't enough. The will must be registered. The will is null and void. It's just a paper. That is point number one. Point number two is that Grandma, you're still alive. The wealth belongs to you after your husband's death. You can transfer it to anyone. That's the most important point. After your demise it'll go to Uncle Selva. Since he is already dead, it'll go to Meera. What's the problem? I told you I don't want it! Stop repeating the same thing like a monkey! A monkey? Grandma, did she just call me a monkey? You should learn to watch what you say! Look, I came all the way because you said you needed my help. Your husband wanted to give it all away to the deity and the temple, right? Please stop showing off. Are you trying to compensate for your mistakes by donating your wealth to me? You may keep your wealth. Fine, it's the family property. I thought, the poor girl should have it. If you don't want it, go to hell. I don't need your sympathy. Love prevails when the relatives maintain distance and when they come close the love turns into rage! Pitchumani, as per my husband's wish please donate the property to the deity, Karuppana Saamy. Perfect! Now, if your wealth issue is sorted, let me leave. Stop! Why are you so restless? If the property is transferred to the deity's temple and after my death, this girl here... comes back and claims that I did this without her consent, what happens then? I am not cheap! I'm not like you! Look at how she's getting furious right now! I'm sure you'll make a scene after I pass away! Meera, your grandma has a point. Of course, you won't do it. You're a decent girl. But if she has a doubt, it must be cleared. I'll give it writing that I don't want this wealth at all! Sounds good? That sounds like a gentleman's agreement. Write it on a plain paper and it'll be null and void like your grandpa's will. Register the document. Grandma, will that be enough? We'll talk when I have the signed document in my hand. I'll do it! Let's register it today. Today? Meera, some things take time. First, as per Grandpa's will, we must measure the land. Then a new will must be typed. The registrar is my friend. We can finish the paperwork in three days. Three days? I can't stay here for three days! Don't you want to resolve this issue? Can't you stay here for three days with your grandma? It's just three days, Meera. Hey! Stop the vehicle! Stop! I said, stop! Hey! Where are you going? Look at her arrogance. She won't even answer me! Forget it, Grandma. Isn't it obvious that she is upset? Let me talk to her. Go on, driver. -Go home, Grandma. I'll get her back. -Okay. Hey, Meera! Wait. Hold on! Why are you upset? I get that it's a pain in the ass to live here after living in a city. But nothing can beat the life in our village. Oh, God! Do you smoke? Does that make me a bitch? When did I say that? You must watch you grandma smoke weed! She finishes a joint in a couple of drags! May l tell you something? But promise me you won't scold me. You are just like your grandma! I swear to God, I'm not kidding, Meera! I am speaking the truth. You're fiery like your grandma! Did she send you here to make peace? Come on. Won't it be awkward to stay in the same place and not talk to each other? Grandma has no malice in her heart. She just doesn't watch her words. She tried to marry me off when I was five years old! Just three days, right? I'll survive. Wow! It's the makeup kit! It's just like the one you have. This is no ordinary makeup kit, Meera. It's the makeup kit used during the last rites of the dead. It's belongs to your boyfriend, Kuberan! I'm kidding! Hey! Why are you touching that makeup kit? Stop touching it! Yeah, right! The box is worth millions, right? That's why we are here to steal it! Stop messing around Amudha! You know he is very protective of his makeup kit. Don't provoke him! Stop stroking his ego! What's he gonna do about it? Kubera! Come out! Kubera! Come out! Amudha and this girl are not touching your makeup kit. Hey stop lying! -We saw that box on the bike and-- -Did you just call it a "box"? Call it a "box" again and I'll finish you off! Who gave you the permission to touch it? Leave before I'm forced to raise my hand on a girl! You better learn to show some respect. Please take her away! Stop creating a ruckus! Why should we leave? Stop showing off! Didn't you hear him? Stop arguing, you wretch! Don't you know how to talk to a woman? Why don't you ask her to shut up? One must be worthy of touching the makeup kit. makeup artist working in the movies are not worthy! Hey! Who the fuck do you think you are? Just shut up! Stop swearing in English! Don't make me swear at you in Tamil! One day I'm gonna break your grandma's jaw! Talk like this and you'll meet the same fate! Kubera, a soaring sparrow can never become an eagle! She is here from the city. How'd she know about your makeup kit? Is this how you react? Come on, Meera. To hell with these assholes! Take her away before I slap her! Look, don't think I'm like that old lady! It's just an old fucking box -with some fucking materials -What the fuck? -Stop showing off! -Meera, leave it. Let it go! -I'm gonna break her jaw -Have you ever seen a real makeup kit? You call this a makeup kit? That's how I'll talk! What will you do? -I'll break your jaw! -Give it a shot! Come on! We got the makeup kit back. Let it go, Kubera! We got it back. Let's go! Hey, Meera... don't talk like this here. Just leave! Leave before things get out of hand. Kubera, food's ready. Come, let's have dinner. You carry on. I'll eat later. Have your dinner and go to bed early. Now, come on. I told you, I'll eat later. Go eat your dinner. I have some news. Please try and listen to it without getting upset. I'm told Krishnaveni's granddaughter is here. Poor girl. She lost her mother. It would be nice if we can pay her a visit. I lost my father. Did anyone offer me the same courtesy? No one from their family turned up to console us. Did you forget? Now you want us to go offer condolences? Why should we behave the same way? What? You might have forgotten, but I still remember the way her mother insulted my father! I'm working hard to build a memorial for my father. And you want me to console the daughter of the woman who insulted him! Go to hell! Stop yelling at your mother! Please get the food. You, go help her. Okay. Your mother was right. Come, let's have dinner. Starving is bad for health. Come, let's eat Hey, Sangudeva! Muthupandi's here. How are you? I am doing good. How's your business? It's going well. Hey, Kubera! Why won't you come talk to me? What's wrong? Why is he sulking? What's wrong? Tell me if there is a problem. Of course, we know you are here for us. We had been to a few places in the neighborhood to apply makeup to the dead. Few places? The death toll in our nation seems to be rising, doesn't it? Well, the good news is that your business is booming. I have to go. I'll see you later. Where are you off to at this hour? Stop teasing me! See you. Mr. Handsome, are you ready?

Please call Muthupandi's wife. Please come. You bitch! Don't you dare touch my husband! I'll kill you! You gave him nothing and that is why he came to me! Oh, God! You mongrel! Why must I listen to her? Do I really deserve this? Oh, God! And you sleep with her and die while fucking her! Listen, Azhagi... now's not the time. Usidha, Muthupandi might have had an affair with you... but Azhagi is his wife and she must perform his last rites. Shut up, asshole! All of you knew he was sleeping with me all these years. Don't you try to defend her! I'll break your jaw! Hey! Stop it! Hey! The man died in my bed! You can still smell my sweat all over him! Go check it out yourself! Oh, God! Don't you dare call yourself a man! Is it necessary for one to sow his wild oats to prove that he's a man? Oh, my God! This is so humiliating! I worry about my daughter's future. Why are we listening to what this slut has to say? Get her out of here! How dare she speak? You bitch! How dare you? You seduce rich men and ruin their life! That is all you do! You bitch! -Stop! Stop, let her go! -You bitch! Listen! Let her go! Enough! You'll end up killing her! I said, let her go! Oh, God! Does hitting me make you feel like a man? Now, get this!

Do it! -Kill me! -Stop it! -Azhagi, think about your daughter. -Come on! You! You may have had millions of moments with Muthupandi but he isn't alive. Hence, his wife must perform the last rites. You better stop making a scene and leave! Don't you want Muthupandi to rest in peace? Now that everything is solved, shall we take the corpse? -Yes! -Carry on. Not yet! Her bites are still on his body. I won't perform the rites unless they are covered. That is impossible. The marks are quite deep. No amount of powder will cover it. I want you to cover it! That's my final wish! I'll behead all three of you if you don't do it! You think you can scare us with a machete? Come here! Hey! Please no! Kubera! Save me! My life is on the line! If you wish to see him alive, cover that mark! Kubera, please do it. Save me! Stop this nonsense! That mark is quite deep. It's impossible to erase it. Check if that's the only bite. Don't worry, brother. If you die, I'll do the makeup for you. Kubera, please save me! Beheading him is easy. But covering that bite is impossible! Trust me! Stop lying! It is not impossible. You're useless. Accept it! Stop blabbering old lady! Let the experts do their job! You just mind your own business! And what if my grand daughter erases that bite? Wait. You claim to be the best makeup artist. You claim to be an expert! But my granddaughter is a makeup artist as well. And she's better than you. Why are you quiet now? Speak up! What is she doing? Only one guy must handle the makeup! Grandma, why change our traditions? It's the last wish of the wife of the deceased. Are your traditions more important than fulfilling her wish? He isn't capable of doing it! My granddaughter will do it. -Get up! -Save me, Kubera! Get up I said get up and show him how it's done. Are you kidding me? I can't do it. Kunjamma, my prestige is in your hands. Why don't you do it yourself? I can't do it. I've already challenged that asshole! Do you really want to embarrass me in front of all these people? Why can't you apply the makeup like you do it in the city? I do makeup for movie stars... and you want me to do it on a corpse? Call it a corpse once again and I'll kill you! Hey, Amudha... I thought she was a well educated and talented girl from the city. But she is just like her mother. Useless! The monkey Kuberan is much better! She's a disgrace to the family. Don't you dare question my talent! This isn't a big deal! If I had my makeup kit, I would have easily done it. Here. Here you go. Cover that bite mark and show Kuberan his place! This was not my idea, Meera. Grandma, asked us to get it Kunjamma, can you do it? We're late. We need to get on with the proceedings. I told you, it's impossible! Coming down from a city with a makeup kit won't make her an expert! We have been doing this for generations. We know what can be done and what's impossible. Shut up and mind your business! Did you guys get the news? I did. What's the news? Do you know Krishnaveni's granddaughter who applied makeup on Muthupandi? You mean our Kunjamma? I heard she works in movies? Did she really do the makeup? She is a makeup artist in the movie industry. After all she is the granddaughter of the great Krishnaveni. She really cleaned Muthupandi up! What's up, Sangudeva? How's life? Sounds good! Got it! Alright! Alright! Are you feeling bad? Doing it once doesn't make her an expert. I have done the makeup for more than hundred corpses. She applies makeup on cinema stars. I do it for the dead. You're right! But people really loved her work today. I saw your jaw dropping as well. I get it. As an artist, you were impressed by another one. Am I right? You know our villagers. You do it and they call it a painting. She does the same and they call it makeup. People always pull the local talent down. Are you afraid of losing business? This isn't just a business... it's the final respect we pay to the dead. She is from the movie industry! She gets paid to apply makeup. She and the actors, their lives are fake! We are the real deal! Fake things always shine brighter! Hey! Why do you get all philosophical when you're taking a dump? Just a few more days... once she leaves, everyone will come back to me. I'll deal them later. By the time they come to you, they’ll be dead. How will you deal with them? Don't mind... but she was chosen to be your bride. Stop being so stubborn. But the girl has some real talent! She is an educated from the city. That's the real deal. Didn't you see her makeup kit? It is full of brushes and creams Do you mind if I suggest something? Let's ask her to join us. How long will we use the same old makeup kit? I am in love with her makeup kit. I want to us it at least once. What do you say? Why are you leaving? Three people have died in the neighborhood. We have to work. Be quick. I'm not done yet. You carry on. Hey, Amudha... the monkey Kuberan is going to be really embarrassed. He used to show off, like the whole village was at his mercy. Asshole! I didn't know why you were asking for the kit. You're clever Grandma! I thought she will refuse. I'm her grandma! She loves me. She pretends to be tough, like her mother. But on the inside, she is just like my son. Did you sleep well? Did you just wake up? Everyone's talking about you. People from the neighboring have been asking about you as well. Grandma promised them that you will apply makeup for them. With whose permission? Did I agree to it? You apply makeup on Muthupandi, right? What's the problem? What's the problem? Why are you so rude, Kunjamma? Grandma is happy that you embarrassed Kuberan. But you're being rude. Keep your issues with Kuberan to yourself. Why are you being rude, dear? Don't you love your grandma? No, I don't. How many times must I tell you? I am here for three days, and that's it! Are you expecting me to stay back and join your mourning business? Stop irritating me by calling me "granddaughter"! It didn't seem like you loved us when you kicked us out! Stop acting like you love me! My mom always wanted me to stay away from you! People show up at the funeral of their enemies as well. You didn't show up for your son's funeral! Aren't you ashamed to talk about love? If I think about it, I shouldn't even show up at your funeral! I did put your parents through hell. I tried to get you married at the age of five. Your mother tried her best to stop it. When I think about all that now... I know your mother was right. I was wrong, dear. My daughter-in-law has raised you well. This old lady is heartless. When I die... please don't show up at my funeral, dear. Forgive me, dear. Grandma! -Grandma! -Stop! Stop. You got it all out of your system. What's bothering you now? I've never seen her cry. It was strange to see her cry today. I hope you know how your marriage was called off. It was called off when your mother slapped Kuberan's father. Things got out of hand. And your mother took you and left the village. Grandma never kicked you guys out. She begged your mother to stay back. Angamma keeps telling me that... Grandma did not know about your father's death for a month after he died. Your mother didn't inform her at all. She didn't allow Grandma to see her son for one last time. Anyone in her place would have the same regret. She mourns for every death in the village. But she couldn't mourn at her own son's funeral. She would mourn at an enemy's funeral as well. And you asked her why she didn't turn up for her son's funeral? Grandma is innocent, Meera. Forget it. You didn't do it on purpose. You found out the truth because you vented your heart out. It was good that you got it out of your system. I saw a smile on Grandma's face after a long time, when you arrived. Come on, just let it go. What? Can you take me to my aunt's? Look at him! Sleeping like a beast. Aunt, please step out for a moment. Look who's here. Hey! Why is she here? Isn't she allowed here? My father didn't build this house to let strangers come in whenever they want. Get out! Let your mother decide. Can't you hear me say it? Both of you get out! Now! Dear... come in. Are you kidding me, Mom? I'm asking her to get out and you're welcome her? She is here after so many years and you're asking her to get out? Don't let strange bitches into our house, I warn you! I'll kick your ass, you mongrel! How dare you call her a bitch? If she sets a foot in our house... I'll lose it! Who is asking you to stay here? Get out! Come in, dear. You have all the time in the world to gossip. But you couldn't inform me that she is coming here. Yeah, right! I have better things to do! I doubt it! Here, dear. Have some buttermilk. Have it. That's it? Give me some. I'm not allergic to buttermilk. Yeah. You'll drink cow's as well! Here! I've waited for years, expecting a visit from you. I wanted to have a grand feast and introduce you to people as my daughter-in-law. But look at this. Here we are, this silent evening, with some leftover buttermilk. Leftover? I knew it. It tastes sour. She is here for the first time. Give her some memories to cherish instead of crying. Is that my uncle? Dear... wait, I'll be back Stop staring and lend me a hand. Yes, I'm coming. What's is it? It's quite heavy. Stop it now! Why do you have this dress? This is her wedding dress. Wedding dress? -Indeed. -Did you buy it? Buy it? I'll break your bones! I stitched it myself, for my daughter-in-law. Idiot! Here, dear. Is this for the groom? Take a look! Look at that, it has a hole for peeing. Get lost! This is the last photo we clicked as a family. That's my son, he looks like a charming prince! If my mom hadn't slapped Uncle... we would have probably been together now. Why dwell on the past, dear? Sister-in-law tends to fly off the handle. Hey, Kunjamma! Where are going? I must leave. In the middle of the night? What's the hurry? I have some work. I must go. You won't get a bus now. Are you gonna walk all the way? Answer me. I didn't know. Hey, old lady! You have made me rough and tough Just like you! This village has changed my life I feel like I'm flying high in the sky A village where the mourning songs Sound like melodies A village where no makeup is required Where it's applied only after death Grandma, is that turkey gravy I smell? The registration was supposed to be completed in three days. What happened? See you, Grandma. I guess, I overcooked the turkey, let me check. Hey, tough lady, your funeral songs Are now my favorites A breeze that carries The smell of cow dung And the fragrance of flowers This is a place to get to know Everyone in person And not through mobile phones A place where you can Laugh with an open heart And get rid of your sorrows Meera, this dress is too short! And slowly, You are getting closer to your old lady Please stop showing off Please stop showing off Please stop showing off Please stop showing off Why aren't you talking to her? What? Why aren't you talking to her? Shut up. Answer me. Her mother slapped my father! That's the reason I don't talk to her. If that's the case, you must be mad at her mother. Right? Ma'am, just shut up and watch the play. Please stop showing off Please stop showing off Did you find it? Can't you see, I'm looking for it? Where will it be? It must be right where you kept it. No thief will ever break into this house. You must have misplaced it. Where the fuck did you keep it? You should learn to watch what you say. Talk to me like that again and... I'll break your teeth! You misplace it... and then you yell at me. Amudha, did you find it? It's a very small house... where can it be? Wait, Meera. Tell me, where did you see it last? If I knew that, why would I ask you? Do you know how many creams and brushes are in it? How will I return to Chennai without the makeup kit? All my savings are gone! Why are you whining over a makeup kit? Can't you apply makeup without it? Talented people don't need a hook to fish. All they need is a stick. Will that monkey cry like you, if he loses his kit? He will get the job done, even with a coconut shell. That's what experts do! And you're making a scene for a few brushes and creams. Do you think these things cost the same as a toothbrush? My makeup kit is worth one lakh rupees! One lakh rupees? Grandma, how many dresses can we buy for one lakh? Oh, God! All these days, you were roaming around with a box worth one lakh rupees? Grandma! Grandma is accusing you of stealing the makeup kit. Why would I take her makeup kit? It must have been you! Where did the makeup kit go? How would I know? Go, look for it! The makeup kit was at home all night. It's been missing since morning. She embarrassed you at Muthupandi's funeral, that's the reason you stole her makeup kit! You monkey! Old lady, don't call me a monkey! My son is a little rough around the edges but he's no thief. I came here because I respect you. I'm not here to listen to this old woman ramble. Quiet, Grandma! Let me speak. Kubera, I'm asking you for the last time... return the box if you've taken it. She needs to leave tomorrow. I have got nothing to do with that box. That's it! Sir, Kuberan never steals. It's Grandma's plan. She is trying to frame Kuberan. Sir, Kuberan holds a grudge against Meera. It's a family dispute. He yelled at Meera for touching his makeup kit. There's no need to link that incident to this one. Didn't he say that he is innocent? He won't talk! We need to summon the panchayat. Fine... I'll talk to the panchayat head and summon everyone. Sounds good? Sir, there's no need. It's okay. You shut up! I want him to say it in front of the entire village! Hey, old lady, can't you just shut up? Sir, don't summon the panchayat. I trust him. For generations they have been applying makeup and paying respect to the dead. I am new here. I just applied makeup once. He wouldn't steal it for such a silly reason. Come, teach me how to swim. Come with me please. Go home or your mom will scold you! Kubera! Come here! Be quick! Back there... Our little Rani... Kubera, you can't keep crying like this. We can carry on with the proceedings, only if you apply the makeup. She drowned. Her corpse will start decaying soon. Sangu, tell him. Isn't Rani your favorite child? We can do the last rites, only once you apply the makeup. Kuberan you must do it. Come on, do it. Should we bury her without the makeup? I cannot, Meera! Leave me alone. Why? You have applied makeup on so many people. You love her, don't you? What's stopping you? Yes... I have applied makeup to a lot of people. But they were all dead. She is still alive. She is just sleeping. She always wanted to apply makeup like a movie star. She kept pestering me. I had my reasons for not doing it. And here's the day I dreaded! I stole your makeup kit, Meera. Old lady... did you hear that? I stole your granddaughter's makeup kit! Sir... Mom... your son is a thief. Sangu... Forgive me. I didn't tell you. I did it out of spite, Meera. No, it wasn't spite... it was my arrogance! My arrogance! I believed that I was the best makeup artist in the whole world. I have brought shame to my ancestors. My little Rani advised me... but I didn't get her. She was smart. I am not fit to apply makeup on her. I am not fit to do that. You do it. Please do it. Please do it. How can I do it, Kuberan? You are a makeup artist as well, right? You do it. That would be the right thing to do. -Hey, Bahu... -I'm here. Here is your makeup kit. Why are you leaving Without applying the makeup? Please apply The eye liner before you leave You were the playful kid moving around Like a log floating in the river You were always so strong And it gave us hope You were the flower that just blossomed Wonder why, God can be so cruel Wonder why, God can be so cruel Why are you so sad, dear? One day, I will die as well. -Stop it. -I mean it. Death is inevitable. If death ceases to exist... humans will become idle and lazy. Like sloths. Just like birth, death should be celebrated as well. Why don't you come to Chennai with me? You can come visit this village whenever you like. Remember what I told you... love prevails when the relatives maintain distance and when they come closer... the love turns in to rage! Have you seen Vittalachariya's movies? My soul will survive only inside this village. If I move out, I am dead. If you wish to see me, come meet me. When are you leaving for Chennai? You wanted me to stay and now you ask me when I'm leaving? Do you want me to leave? Do you really feel you can fool me with those puppy eyes? I am your grandma, I can read your mind! Come on. Hey, Amudha... Is the bus late? It always is. The bus service sucks! Give me a call when you reach Chennai. She came here all alone. She can take care of herself. She is my granddaughter. I care for her. Are you leaving, dear? I would have been here early. I'm late because of this idiot! He wanted to look good. Mom! Shut up! Here. What is that? It's a wedding dress for her future daughter-in-law. Wedding dress? You should see the groom's dress. It has special hole for peeing! Thanks, Aunt. Aunt? Be careful, these guys are dangerous! Mom... What's going on? What are you two talking about? My son wants to talk to her. Let him talk, who's stopping him? He wants to speak to her privately. I knew it! So, this is the reason you guys are here! What business does he have with my granddaughter? There's no need to talk. Grandma! What the hell is happening? Look at him, following her like a pet. Grandma, you won't get it. These are what they call "feelings." Forgive me, Meera. You can call me Kunjamma. I wanted to speak to you when you came back. But Sangu told me you were arrogant and stopped me from speaking to you. We had our family problems as well. And then, at Muthupandi's funeral... we had a fight. I thought you were arrogant like your mom and I fought with you. Okay, so? So... I apologize for stealing your makeup kit, Meera. Okay, I forgive you. And? Are you kidding me? Can't you see I'm apologizing. Sangu was right. You are arrogant! Just like your mom! Excuse me! You wanted to talk to me, you apologized. I accepted your apology. How does that make me arrogant? Kunjamma! I made a stupid mistake! I'm indeed a monkey, like the old lady says. Please forgive me. You have apologized thrice. And I've accepted it. I am leaving to Chennai today. Don't you have a farewell gift for me? No, I didn't get you anything. I forgot. "Kunjamma! Forgive me" right? Give me your makeup kit. My makeup kit? It's not even worth a hundred rupees That's what I want. But if you don't want to... Why are you getting upset? Wait, I'll get it. My ancestor's makeup kit. It has been with us for three generations now. It's going to city for the first time. Please take care of it. May I touch it now or do I still need to be worthy of it? Come on! When will we meet again? What scene are we shooting today? Remember, the heroine died in the last episode? We're shooting her funeral. Hey, I need some people over there. You! Go sit next to the guy with the mustache. Get another garland! Stop driving me crazy! Welcome, ma'am! Is this the time to show up? Please, go eat now. We'll wait for you. To hell with your sorry. Stupid punk! Stop making my life miserable! Get out of here! Where is the actress? Make sure she is ready. Weren't you listening? Please leave! Go, get things ready! Okay, sir. It's my bag. Don't worry, I'll take care of it. Sorry, I am late. Ma'am! Sir wants to see you. Be quick! Alright. To hell with your bloody ma'am! What is it, sir? Don't you know you must be in position while shooting? First, you come late for work and then you work like crap! What is this? Don't you know you're suppose to cover her tattoo? Your assistants didn't inform me that she'll be wearing a sleeveless dress. Didn't you tell her? Sir! It was the cameraman's idea. Alright! Cover the tattoo! Quick! Look at your grandma! She has left us all! Grandma, look! Your granddaughter is here! Grandma, look! Your granddaughter is here! A caged parrot... A caged parrot... It flew out of its cage It didn't even bid me goodbye It flew away To soar high in the sky, forever And to perform The queen's last rites Here I am, your granddaughter Will you open your eyes... For one last time Will you open your eyes and look at me
