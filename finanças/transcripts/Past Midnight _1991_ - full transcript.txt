Snohomish. Everett next. Hey gorgeous. Hi. How you doing? How was the funeral? I can't talk about it yet. Well, I'm glad you're back. - Did you miss me? - Uh huh. How's the office? Oh, boring without you there. What, no office intrigue? I wouldn't want to miss anything. Well, let's see. Jerry switched from regular to decaffeinated. Erica went out with some guy in a rock band who bit her ass all night. Interesting. Yeah, she thought so. She's seeing him again. And Ben Jordan was released on parole. Don't tell me they relocated him in Snohomish? Well, there's good news, and there's bad news. What's the bad news? They relocated him to Snohomish. What's the good news? He's your case, and not mine. Dorothy, your husband has missed our last five sessions. He obviously doesn't want to change. Or can't change. I think it's time to consider going to the shelter. Miss Mathews, that's my home. That's where I get my mail. That's my phone number. I'm not saying he's a monster, I'm saying he's sick. I know it's hard but if you press charges, the court will make him get the help he needs. I have to go. Before I miss my bus for work. All right, Dorothy. I'm making an appointment for your husband for next Wednesday at three. If he doesn't show up, I'll be at your apartment Thursday morning. We'll settle it one way or the other. Miss Mathews, thank you. I heard a couple of new jokes for you while you were gone. They're really offensive. So what else is new? Okay, you wanna hear the dead baby joke or the sexist joke? What, no black jokes? Yeah, I got a racist joke but those aren't funny anymore. Gimme... ah... the... Gimme the sexist joke. Okay, what's the difference between a whore and a bitch? Jee, I'm not sure, Stevo. What is the difference between a whore and a bitch? A whore will sleep with anybody. A bitch will sleep with anybody but me. Oh God! How you doing? Just take a seat. - We still on for dinner? - Oh no, see you later. Can I help you? Yes, they say you can. - Is this you? - Uh huh. How old? Four, maybe. The eyes. They're very pretty. What can I do for ya? I'm here to see my social worker. My parole officer told me to see you right away. Ben Jordan. You really should have called and set up an appointment. Right. Since you're here, you might as well sit down. Do you like mysteries? What? Book you're reading. I like the Travis McGee novels a lot. Well, maybe you should try David Goodis. He wrote a book called The Burglar. It's excellent. I'll keep an eye out for him. I've been reading your file. Good reading? As a matter of fact, it is. IQ of 146. You're a pretty smart man. I don't know. Ted Bundy had 150. Mr. Jordan I'm not here to make any judgments about your past. I'm here to help you with your future. What you did in prison was very impressive but I'm not going to lie to you. With your record, it's not going to be easy getting you work. Right now the best you can expect is something that pays minimum wage. Certainly nothing up to your capabilities but I'm confident that if we work together... Miss Mathews. Is it all right if I smoke? What? Helps ease the frustration. You're not taking this very seriously, are you? Can we skip the therapy? I'm seeing a shrink for that. I need a job. All right. I'll give you a referral to E.D.D. before you leave. Can I have it now? All right. Ask for Walt Dieter. Good, it's a start. - Are we done? - I guess. Ben, what did you do when you arrived in town? Went to see my parole officer. After that. I went for a walk. I tried calling my mom. Bought a pair of socks. Oh, and then... I had a pizza. How did it taste? The best cardboard pizza I've ever had. I can imagine. No you can't. What did you think of Jordan? What do you mean? Did I think he was cute? Well, it's funny you should say that 'cause ever since I him today, whenever I go pee... I was surprised when I saw him, and I was wondering if you had the same reaction. I think for a serial killer, he's a damn fine-looking guy. He's not a serial killer. Right, he only kills the ones he loves. Look, I didn't talk to him. You did. What do you think? Hmmm, good. I think maybe he's changed over the years. I read all the paperwork on him. He deserved that parole. He's intelligent, he has a kind of charm. He got his Master's degree in Psychology while he was inside. I don't think he's the same man he was 15 years ago. Look, if a kid robs a liquor store, okay, and he shoots the guy behind the counter. I can believe that after 15 years, that kid might not do it again. But whatever it was that made Jordan pick up that knife and slaughter his wife and his unborn baby scares the hell out of me. Why? Cause I don't like how it makes me feel. How's that? Like they should have executed him. Yeah he's back inside. Uh huh. Hauled him out of the house last week with a couple of kilos. - Mr. Samuels? - Yeah. Hi, Laura Mathews. Ben Jordan's social worker. Look my man, I'll call you later. Damn, old Ben ain't doing too bad for himself, did he? Most social workers I've seen look like eh... well you know. Let's see. Jordan. I have some questions I need answered to find Mr. Jordan work in my community. Fine. Eh, is it Mrs. or Ms.? - Ms. - Well, Ms. Mathews. I'll help you but you ain't gonna find that boy a job. What makes you say that? Well, if I owned a hardware store or a little gas station somewhere, I wouldn't want that sick S.O.B. on my property. I'll find Ben work, all right. I'm very good at my job. Well, go ahead and do that, then, and good luck to you. I mean that. So, what can you tell me about the Kathy Tudor murder. On the night of August 4, 1975, Ben Jordan took a kitchen carving knife and stabbed his better half 30 times... Thirty-six. - My mistake. She was... - Six months pregnant. Now tell me something I don't know. There was a witness who heard the girl scream around 11:30. She didn't think much about it, went on back to watching Johnny Carson. Then a little past midnight, she hears something else. So she goes to the window and sees Jordan stagger out of his house with what looks like a kitchen carving knife in his hand, toss it on the front lawn, get in his car and drive off. Cops found him passed out drunk in his car a little before dawn. The knife was the murder weapon. His prints was all over it and the movie camera he filmed the murder with was his own. What movie camera? Cops found a super-8 movie camera at the scene. Jordan filmed the murder. It's in the police file in Ellensburg. The way I understand it, it makes... Nightmare On Elm Street look like Charlotte's Web. Still wanna find him a job? I'm sorry I'm late. Can I sit down? Sure, make yourself comfortable. I...eh... I have a lot I'd like to talk to you about. Good. Where would you like to start? I heard you were at Lee Samuels's office. You were nosing around, weren't you? I wish you wouldn't. I don't think you're in a position to tell me how to do my job. It might not be much, but it is my life. Did he tell you about the film? - Yes. - Do you wanna know why? Sure. So do I. You wanna talk about it? I'm only here because I have to be. If you can get me a job, I'll be grateful, then I'll walk. Would it make you feel better if I told you I didn't kill her? Did you? Are you saying you believe me? Gimme a chance. Jee, I... I don't know. You've built up some pretty good defenses, haven't you? Yeah. Avoidance, denial. I know the terms, they don't apply. - You sure? - Yes, are you? You know what we're doing. Good old yard bird sparing. You mean you're playing games. I don't pry into your past. I have to know who you are. You have my file. I can't help you if you won't let me. Let me tell you something. If we were to have this kind of an exchange in the joint, one of us would end up with a shank between the ribs. That isn't funny. No, it isn't. This was the stuff on the reel they shot first. They found a shitload of these little reels. Jordan was quite the home movie nut. And I don't mind telling you this film was a bitch to get. Perfect picture of American white-trash marital bliss. What happened? His camera must have run out of film. So he didn't actually film the murder. Not for lack of trying. But you never see Jordan actually kill her. Disappointed? You made this film sound like proof positive that he did it. What you need, Laura? To see the bloody knife in his hand jab her in the belly? Yeah, that is what I need, that's what I was expecting to see. You know, I was confused before I watched this. Now I'm even more confused. Confused? Confused about what? His guilt? Come on, Kathy not only knew the murderer but she was comfortable with him. She offered him a beer. She did this little dance for him. I seriously doubt she'd act that way for just some burglar. Maybe it was somebody else she knew. Yeah well you can say "maybe" all God damned day but I don't think you really believe it I'm playing devil's advocate, here. That wasn't a crime of passion, that was planned. Something a serial killer might do. He planned to kill her. He even filmed the event for posterity, and after he did it, he got blind stinkin' drunk? First he uses method, then he's out of control? Come on. Maybe you're giving him too much credit. Maybe Jordan just isn't a natural born killer. Maybe the reason he got himself all drunk was because what he did freaked him out. Now who's mister maybe? Yeah maybe so. But still, my maybes are better than maybes. I gotta get my butt home. Well, I sure appreciate you getting a hold of a copy of that film for me. Like you said, we're working together. Would you mind too terribly if I borrowed it for a while. Would you mind if I ask you why? Goodnight Ms. Mathews. Goodnight Mr. Samuels. Hello. Yeah, hi. It's Ben. Ben Jordan?... How did you get my number? Oh, from the phone book. There were two L. Mathews, one of them was a dentist. I've been thinking. Maybe I haven't been fair. You're only trying to help and I've been slapping you around. Are you still there? - Laura. - Yes. I'm calling... to say I'm sorry. That's all. Goodnight. Goodnight. If you'd committed a crime and all the evidence was against you, how long would it take a jury to bring in a verdict of guilty? - Laura. - I'm just asking. A day or two? Look, don't get emotional about this one. You being protective? Yeah, I'm being a little protective. Well bless your heart. Okay Nancy Drew, listen... You know, one of the days, you're gonna realize that this platonic shit is for the birds, and that it has been me all along. But, that glorious and magical day is not going to happen if Ben Jordan kills you. Do you ever suppose that he might be innocent? Yeah. A man goes to trial, and he's innocent until proven guilty. Then he's convicted, and he's guilty unless proven innocent. Don't make me out to be some kind of narrow-minded jerk because you're being naive. There are a few things that don't make any sense. Yes, well, I'm sure there are. But you're not a detective. You're a social worker. So, talk to him, give him advice, find him a job. Speaking of which, I think I got him one. - You did? - Uh huh. Where? H & R Meats, swing shift, strong back stuff, strictly donkey work. That's okay. He just needs a job. Did you tell him? Naw, I figured he'd rather hear it from you. Thanks for the help, Steve. Sure, but if somebody ends up hanging from a meat hook, I'm not taking responsibility. I wanted to give you something. For your help. This is beautiful. Did you do this? I noticed you like flowers. You should really thank Steve. When I get a chance, I will. It's been a while since I had a drink. Hmm, I must admit I'm surprised. - About the job? - That we're having dinner. I'm not exactly your mother's idea of a date. - You don't know my mother - Oh. Anyway, this isn't a date. Oh, what is it? Support for the poor and misguided? You should put that on your wall. You're not making this easy. I didn't know it was supposed to be. I'm sorry, I'm doing it again. I've been away too long. I forget how to behave, sometimes. You wanna talk about something else? What about you? Who is Laura Mathews? Or does it only go one way? I don't think I want to play. I don't mean bare your soul. Little stuff like eh... Where were you born? Who would your mother approve of? Another time, maybe. Avoidance. Denial. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. Door was open. Would it make you feel better if we had some more light? I'd feel better. This is good work. My father did it. He died before he could finish it. That's nice. What are you doing here? I've been trying to understand your interest in me. I've been turning it around in my head. It doesn't make any sense. Maybe it's the angel of mercy picture on your wall. Or maybe you really do like mysteries. So I thought I'd ask. We'll talk about it tomorrow in the office. I don't think you're being honest. Please. I'm making you nervous. Yes. All right. Give me a second. Do you want to know if I'm innocent? The last time I was innocent was 15 years ago in court. Innocence doesn't exist in prison. It doesn't matter. Nobody cares. If you care... Stay away from me. Don't ask me out to dinner. I get confused. You can't go out in that. I'll give you a ride home. Rain's never killed anybody. Here, take this. Angel of mercy. Who the hell are you? - Mr. Tudor? - Yeah, that's me. Hi, my name's Laura Mathews. I'd like to talk to you about Ben Jordan. Hey, I'd love to talk about that cocksucker. You want some cocoa? Oh, no thanks. Five years early for good behavior. What the fuck is good about his behavior? Slap in the face to my daughter, to me, to the whole community. Could you tell me a little about Kathy's friends? She had a few girlfriends. Not too many. Could you tell me how to get in touch with them? They got married and moved away. Besides, I was Kathy's best friend. It wasn't like the normal father-daughter relationship. We were good friends. The best. You look tired. I am a little tired. Well, I have got the cure for that. Magic hands. Oh, no thanks, I'm ticklish. Do you have Kathy's high school year book or anything? It's buried somewhere in this stuff. What paper did you say you worked for? I'm not a reporter. I'm with Social Services. Up in Snohomish. They sent Ben Jordan? Yeah, I'm Ben Jordan's social worker. Get out of here. - Please. - Get the hell off my property. Do I have to call the authorities? I guess I do. No you don't. Thank you very much for your time. Oh you're a pretty lady, aren't you? Hello. I'm Laura Mathews. Hello, my name is Larry. And I am very happy to make your acquaintance. Well Larry, I'm very happy to make your acquaintance, too. I came here to ask you some questions. Would you mind? - No. - Good. A long time ago, you were at a trial, it was a murder trial for Ben Jordan. You told all the people that you saw somebody else going to that house. Do you remember that? It wa... tha... eh... Yeah. I... I wa... I... was... Th... that wa... was when... I was... just a kid. You're right, it was a long time ago. I was hoping you could tell me what it was you saw. You remember that night, Larry? Sort of. Did you know Ben Jordan? He was... He was a fr... He was a friend of my brother's. Ben Jordan was your brother's friend? But it... it wasn't Ben. Wasn't Ben you saw going to the house. It was somebody else? You sure about that? Well, I... swore on the Bible. And you can go to Hell if you swear the Bible and it ain't the truth. What did the other person look like? Well, he w... was older. He wa... He was bigger. I...I don't remember too good. Well Larry, it's been a pleasure talking with you. Likewise. Thanks very much. Listen lady. If you want to talk to somebody around here, you talk to me. What? Larry is very happy here. I take good care of him, and he takes good care of me. Mr. Canipe I think you have me confused with somebody else. You're a social worker, aren't you? Yes I am. Well, Jesus Christ how many fucking times are you people gonna come out here? I'm not here about you or Larry or your farm... The county didn't send you down here? No. I'm Ben Jordan's social worker. He's living in Snohomish now. I thought I'd come down here and find out what I could about his case. You came down here to talk to Larry about Ben? Yeah. Sorry. Oh, I owe you a big apology. Oh, ah... Oh boy, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. Well I did mean to scare you but... You're not the person I wanted to scare. You see, I'm a trucker and... Every so often, I have to go off on long hauls and leave Larry by himself here. Well, that's okay, 'cause Larry can take care of himself. But once in a while, they send somebody down here to... give us a hard time about it. It's okay, I understand. Did Larry help you out? Sort of, he said that you and Ben were friends. Oh yeah, me and Ben were friends all right. Yeah, he was a real hell raiser. I got him out of a lot of trouble. Yeah what kind of trouble? Oh I'm making it sound worse than it was. Just kid stuff. Wildness. Think he killed Kathy Tudor? I don't wanna. I don't know. That was a long time ago. At the time, I knew that he didn't do it. Now I don't know what I know. If you thought he didn't do it, do you have any ideas who did? I don't know. The guy Larry saw, I guess. I don't know. It could have been anybody. Well thank you very much. I appreciate it. Ah, if you're Ben's social worker, you're gonna see him, right? Yeah, I'll see him. Well you tell him that Todd says... What does Todd say? Tell him Todd says "Good luck" and... and he's a ugly son of a bitch. - Sure. - All right, thank you. Lord have mercy, I sure didn't help Ben much during that trial. I was at the time a little full of myself. I've learned to... loosen up just a little since then. Here, Ben's file, here we go, Ben's unemployed. Been drinking, he has got an 0.18 blood alcohol level. 0.18! I mean that's a heavy load we're talking about. We're talking falling down drunk. The way I see it, if Ben comes home tha... Excuse me for interrupting but how do you know Ben got drunk before he got home, instead of after? The clerk that sold him the booze saw him guzzling it out in the car. All right listen to this. Say I'm Ben and you're Kathy, okay. I'm trying to stab you. As drunk as I am, my thrusts are gonna be all over the place. Am I right? They weren't. All of them were straight in. Dead center. Sorry, am I upsetting you? - I'll manage. - Good. There's another thing. Why in the hell the home movies? Yeah that's what I've been thinking. Then there's Kathy. Sweet Kathy. There she sits, smiling. Her husband comes home tanked and she's gonna offer him another beer? You're right, it doesn't make any sense. You know what? Never did make any sense. All they ever had on Ben was circumstantial evidence. Bottom line to this is Bill Tudor. A very powerful man in this town. Member of the Moose Lodge. Masons. He wanted action. Some bastard had murdered his daughter, and he wanted some bastard to pay for it. You saying Ben was framed? Not intentionally framed, no. I mean Ben could have done it. That was good enough for them. They said you were gonna be back this afternoon. I called your office. Do you mind? That's okay. Sit down. I just got back from Ellensburg. I talked with people. You did what? Carlton Daniels, Larry and Todd Canipe... I asked you not to nose around. Ben, I know you're innocent. I know you didn't kill Kathy. It was somebody else. Why don't you leave me alone? I don't need to go through it all again so you can feel like the angel of fucking mercy. Damn! What's the big deal about trusting me? Why do you wanna go on hiding? I can't believe you'd rather feel sorry for yourself than clear your name or find out who did kill your wife. What are you trying to do? Or does it feel safer to stay bars? It's none of your damned business. You wanna stay there, I'm not gonna stop you. Oh psychology, gimme a break. Ben. You didn't do it, did you? I know the truth. I don't need to prove it to anybody. I don't care, I really don't. I do. Guess I better go. Following me is a little melodramatic, don't you think, Steve? I'm not following you, okay. Listen, what the hell do you think you're doing? Look I know our relationship hasn't exa... Oh jeez, is that what you think this is about? You think I'm jealous? Gimme more credit than that. Look, if you were fucking the milkman, I would be jealous. But you're not. Jesus Christ, Laura, this guy is dangerous. Not to me. Why? 'Cause he hasn't left you in a pool of your own blood yet? You're being melodramatic. Fuckin' A. I'm being melodramatic. He wasn't guilty. That'd be nice if it was true. But it's not. Look Steve, you don't know anything about the trial, the case, or the man. I know the facts, and I know my heart. And they say he's innocent. Oh my God, oh my God. Oh. I...I got it working. I felt like doing something. I also wanted to say I am sorry for the last time. Don't worry about it. You have hands like my father's. Strong and beautiful hands. Like they're carved out of stone. Hm. Mornin'. Hi. You okay? Yeah. I had a nightmare. I woke up, didn't remember where I was or how I got there. I watched you breathe for awhile. I, um... How long's he been there? Since I got up. It's what he does. I know. Jordan, come here. - Mr. Lundy. - I want to talk to you. The boss is watching. Listen, I want you to understand something. I am watching you. You do anything to violate your parole, and I mean anything, you are back inside, do you understand that? If anything happens to Laura, you're not going to make it to trial. I guarantee it. Mr. Lundy, thanks for the job. If he steps out of line, I want to be first to know. Where did you meet her? In a bar. The kind of place where the floor is covered with sawdust and busted teeth. Real romantic. What about you? You must have guys, like Steve. Steve's, uh... Just a friend? Not always. We had an affair. It lasted about a month before I decided we were better off as friends. That figures. You ever married? Once. He had an affair, and so I threw him out. Oh! He did something knowing that if I found out I'd be terribly hurt and he did it anyway. Are you wondering if this is a mistake? Do you know what these taste like? Come here. Oysters. How'd you know it's not poisonous? You first. Me second. Like oysters, huh? Mm-hm. You're right. It's delicious. Your turn. No. Let me have some of yours. - Hi. - Hi, uh, Northwest Parcel, can you just sign right there? Sure. Who's it from? Got me. - Great. - Thanks. Bye. Something wrong? Just some more stuff of my dad's. I'm sorry, I gotta run. Okay. Want some coffee? Oh, great. Thank you. So... - I'll see you later. - Mm-hm. You, you call me. Sure. Hey. Hey. Got your, uh, gift the other day. Am I supposed to say thanks? - What gift? - Oh, come on, Steve, stop acting like a baby. You know, the way you tried to deliver your message was incredibly insulting. I don't know what you're talking about. I can't be responsible for your heart when it's out in the open on your sleeve like that. Okay. Hi, thanks for coming. Can I get you anything while you're waiting? A cup of coffee? No, I'm fine. Mr. Canipe, what are you doing here? I, uh, I came to talk to you, ma'am. Sit down. What about? Well, uh... It's about my brother's testimony. Larry was lyin'. He was nowhere near that house the night Kathy died. Why would your brother perjure himself like that? He did it 'cause I asked him to. Why? Well, I guess it seems silly now, but at the time, I was doing Ben a favor. I was the best friend he had, and nobody, with good sense, was going to listen to me. I hoped the fact that Larry was a kid and slow would give him sympathy. Instead the lawyers just used it against him. Why didn't you tell me this in Ellensburg? Well, you came to the farm and started asking questions, and I just stuck to my story. Then, well, about a week ago, Mr. Lundy there, he came to the farm and he said you might be in some trouble. I got spooked. Well, thank you very much for telling us your story. Have a pleasant trip back to Ellensburg. - Good day, Mr. Canipe. - So long. Let me call you back. You think you're pretty clever, don't you? Look, you are mad now... You're goddamn right I'm mad. You wanted the truth, I got it for you. Oh, I get the truth all right, I get the truth about you. There's nothing you won't do, is there? There's not a goddamn thing you won't do! You want me to be the asshole? Okay, I'm the asshole. Ben is innocent. And I don't care if you bring 100 Todd Canipes through that door. Just stay the hell away from me from now on! H & R Meats. Ben Jordan, please. Jordan? He hasn't been here in over a week. Hello? Hello? Then, ah, that's it, isn't it? Yeah. You know, if you don't mind my saying it, I'm a little surprised. Didn't you think of using anything? At that moment I wasn't thinking at all. Score one for passion, huh? Hey. Are you alright? No. No, I'm not. Hi, this is the residence of Laura Mathews. I'm not home right now, but if you leave a message, I'll return your call right away. Wait for the beep. Damn it, Laura. What the hell's goin' on? I know you're there. Pick up the phone. Laura. Call me, okay? I miss you. Laura. Laura. Are you there? Pick up the phone. Please. Hello. Hi. I was worried. How have you been? I've been busy. Oh. Yeah, me too. Oh yeah? You been busy at work? No, not exactly. I was, uh... Listen, uh... I need to talk to you. Oh, okay. Give me a couple of minutes, I'll be right there. No, uh, not here. Just coffee, thanks. The same here. I'm sorry I lost my job. I was going to tell you, but you didn't give me enough time. It's not important. So, what did you want to talk about? Laura. I'm pregnant. You keeping the baby? Are you? Hm? I don't know. Why not? You afraid it's gonna be a psychopath? I don't know what I'm afraid of. You think I killed her. What changed your mind? Do you know what I think? I think you've been slumming, and now you're getting scared. God, are you luck I didn't get drunk one night. I could have killed you! Oh, stop, please! Look at me. Alright? Laura? You alright? My god, Steve, what are you doin'? I got a little worried when you didn't answer your phone, so, so here I am. Good excuse as any for a little early morning fishing, I guess. Think there's ever going to be a time when you don't hate me? Steve, I don't hate ya. It's just that right now I'm pretty pissed off at ya. But I'm also kinda spooked, so I'm glad you're here. Uh, would it be alright if I talked to Miss Mathews for a second? Hi. Miss Mathews, I'm Detective Allan Tobias. I know you've been through a lot today, so I'll try and make this short, but I need to ask you, um, do you know anyone who might have reason to kill Steve Lundy? Alright, we'll try it again. Where were ya? In my room. At the motel? Yeah. And you didn't leave your room all night. You got it. What did you do last night? I slept. How about this morning? I was still sleeping. You slept all night. Didn't get up to take a piss or anything, right? Yeah, once. I don't suppose you have any witnesses to that, huh? I piss alone. Ben, what'd you think of Steve Lundy? I will miss him. Thank you. Hi. Hi. That was, uh, that was a very nice service. Jordan was released from jail this morning. He was what? Public Defender said that we had to show cause if we wanted to hold him, and we didn't have any. Just thought I'd let you know. Miss Mathews, I want to let you know too that you don't have anything to worry about, because I have a man staked out 24 hours a day. There's something else I'd like to ask. Uh huh. Now, people have been saying that there's something between you and Jordan. I know it's none of my business, but it might help if I knew. There was something. Laura! Would you let me in? Laura! No! Before the cops get here! Laura! You believed in me. You were the only one! Open this damn door! Stay the hell away from me. I've got a gun! It was pouring rain that night. I'd gotten laid off a week before, so I was out looking for a job not having any luck. I stopped off, picked up a couple of six-packs, and just sat in the car, drinking, trying to work things out in my head. We were young. I was thinking, maybe I wasn't ready for the baby, or that I'd be a lousy father. Anyway, I tied one on. Around about 11, I figured I better be getting on home, while I could still drive. I found her. I didn't kill anybody. I just didn't. Hi. Hi. For the baby. You're a little early, but thanks. Come on, let's get out of here. You go ahead. I'll be a few minutes. Can I ask you something? Sure. Why are you having the baby? I mean, I know it's none of my business, but why? Because, I guess because in the middle of all of this death, it's a life. Thanks for the present. Dog's lost the scent. Can't see a damn thing. Nothing so far. We're gonna call it a night. Gonna leave a couple of men here. I think you'll be fine. - If you need me, call me. - Okay. - Thanks. - See you in the mornin'. - Good night, boys. - Good night, sir. - I'll be in the studio. - Do you want one of us to go with you? I'd rather be alone. This is the place where I fell in love with you. - Ben... - Shh. I don't wanna hear your voice. When you turned on me, the first thing to go was your voice. You believed in me. I wonder, why did you stop? Laura. When I found my wife, she was lying in a pool of blood, eyes, staring. I remember calling her name, sitting there on my knees, holding her. The knife was still in her belly. I had to pull it out. I just had to. Nothing else I could do. Get out of here. Come on. They got him, huh? Yeah. They, they got him. What are you doin' here? I was out there with them. The others left because of the rain, but I thought I'd try a little harder. I'm chilled to the bone. Can I have a cup of coffee? Hello? Laura? Tobias. I'm sorry he got as far as he did, but at least we got to him before he could do anything to you, huh? - Daddy! - What? So glad you called. Alright, I hear you. If you're in trouble, find a way to say "yes." Yeah, very much. And I always will. Hang in there. I mean it, Laura, hang in there. Help's on the way. I have to go now. Love you. My father. I know. Would you like some more coffee? No. Thank you very much. Please. No. Please, please, please. Woo! I got 'em, Ben! I got both of 'em! Now, you stay right there. You'll be safe. I'm going back in, and I'm gonna take care of her. Todd! No! Christ! Laura! You should have blown his head off like I said, and we could have avoided all this. Laura! Ah! - Help me! - Laura! Help me! Help me! Ah! - Ah! - Laura! Ah! Turn it on. Turn it on! Look at her. Look at her! She offered me a drink and everything. Why not? I'm Ben's buddy. Ben came home 30 minutes after I killed her. I just hid in the bedroom. He came in, he saw her on the floor, and he ran out. Poor Ben. Poor Kathy. There were others before her. And they all had these bellies. These big, round bellies. But don't misjudge me. I'm not a sex maniac. I'm not some Son of Sam asshole. I don't hear voices. Not like I have to kill somebody every week. The first time momma made me put it in, I felt sick. Then as her belly swelled, and she climbed on top of me, it got so I couldn't breathe. I held my breath until she went away again and left me alone. No!
