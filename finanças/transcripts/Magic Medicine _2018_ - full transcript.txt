(soft music) - In 2012, a team of British researchers asked the question, what would happen if we treated 20 people suffering from severe depression with magic mushrooms? It took them three years to get permission to find out. I've tried I think maybe six or eight different antidepressants and have never worked. It I can't be for patients has been four years ago, I realized that I couldn't go in on us. You know, she didn't say anything. Find a way to change About 50% of people don't respond to antidepressants and one in six of them go on to kill themselves. So we really should be exploring every other treatment available. With me, what I've always been desperate to do is to try and find a physical reason for feeling this way. Although I didn't want to take my life, I didn't want to wake up. I want to go to sleep, just not have to face severe. Depression is so prevalent, everyone's exposed to it. We're looking at giving psilocybin to patients with quite severe treatment resistant major depression. - I don't think it's normal to feel the way I do the anxiety, the fear the terror panic. If this is living then it sucks. It really does. - [Announcer] LSD was isolated by stolen Hoffman in a Sandoz pharmaceutical company of Basel, Switzerland. The door swung wide open for research into the nature of this piece of reading process, and in a larger sense into the biochemistry of psychosis. Between 1950 and 1965 40,000 patients were prescribed a psychedelic drug for neuroses, schizophrenia and psychopathy. These trials resulted in over 1000 scientific papers. If you have enough Is that a beautiful experience? I would say - [Narrator] when psychedelics became available to the wider public in the 1960s, dramatic changes in attitudes and behavior. - This is one area where we cannot have budget cuts, because we must wage what I have called Total War against public enemy number one in the United States, the problem of dangerous drugs in 1971, under pressure from President Nixon, the UN declared that all psychedelic drugs should be classified as schedule one. - One of the difficulties in terms of schedule one drugs, including psilocybin, is that because they're in schedule one, this has discouraged any research into the middle medical value of that drug and there's been virtually nothing in the world Research ever since 1960s. - [Narrator] With backing from the Medical Research Council, the team at Imperial College London are conducting the first ever clinical trial of psilocybin, the active ingredient of magic mushrooms. - This isn't a job to rush if you think that somebody could have one of the most profound experiences of their whole lives and they're ready for the music here. - That was taken was a winter of 2010 when it was really cold and we had a lot of snow so happy time. I was Yeah, yeah, it was really nice. Yeah. I mean today going down to Imperial, it's actually Hammersmith hospital. And tomorrow is the first dosing day. Can you put into words how important this is? But sir That's a tough one (soft music) well we woke up Mikey got a call was it seems there was a fight so thank you for rolling resolving that put my readers on. And because we're gonna sleep upstairs so we thought the price if we wait into the kitchen for some reason during the session there was a tickle in the kitchen. We just thought oh well it's just not much. We'll be we'll be fine. And the next thing we knew that when we come back a few hours leading up to the step in there, how does that affect you in the knowledge of the trial coming up, aim right at that point I thought I'm not going to do I can't do it. But for me, it's the last chance. I think this is that, you know, I don't think there's any all medicines that title these ones that's been made in a lab and none of what, you know the very short term impacts and then nothing. (soft music) Over the past 30 years, I've had maybe 30 different types of medication, antidepressants, some of them have worked for a short time some work for a bit longer but they all kind of tail off was I had a CT at 23 sessions of which I've been told worked for a period But then the effects you know, wore off. So I do feel like this trial is another kind of last chance to make any kind of change for me, but I felt that before. Robin Carhartt Harris is the trial lead and head of psychedelic research at Imperial College. I have suffered from clinical depression. You know, I've been through some dark times. So I think that kind of thing helps you have sympathy for people who suffer from New disorders in general. Psychedelics are, for me easily the best tool that exists to study both the mind and the brain. I think it has the potential to revolutionize depression treatment, if not psychiatry, Professor David Nutt, head of neuro psychopharmacology will oversee the trial. This part of the brain is called the cortex. And in the cortex, you do your hearing and your seeing etc. But also in this part of the cortex, particularly this bit here goes from the front to the back here. There's the sense of self. It integrates what you can see and hear and with what you can think and feel. And serotonin is an important chemical in the brain. It's a fundamental neurotransmitter for regulating brain function, particularly in the emotional sphere. And what psilocybin and other plant products do is to stimulate those receptors and by stimulating them we can mimic serotonin in the brain, and sometimes perhaps, do more than serotonin is doing because in some people say returning may not be working adequately. As it will launch into more symbolic one life into another. Sometimes you think they be strong because you don't want to come across as an emotional mess. I woke in the early hours and I was weeping and I don't know where it came from. It's quite difficult. It's it's quite tough their two days is the first time Simply to test the volunteers tolerance to the drug. And the treatment days will follow a week later. Each trip lasts about six hours. And a psychologist and psychiatrist always in the room. The experience of taking the capsules is going to be very significant for him. He's never experienced anything like this at all in his life. And he's a scientist. He's someone that really enjoys kind of the predictability of testing hypotheses and problems that can be solved without actually so this is a huge departure from that. I can remember being in the doctor's and feeling absolutely ashamed of where i was. You know, I worked as a scientist and as a team leader, and out of the blue, I was told that I had to work in a procurement department and this was pretty much my vision of how Really, there was just this a base that was in front of me. And I went to see the occupational health nurse. Before I knew it was in floods of tears and just completely burned down. And she said to me, there's something seriously wrong me. And yeah, we're, what, 13 years down the road now. (laughs) Real laughs a minute. I have been thinking about it quite a lot this afternoon. I'm worried that he's so different, that I take a long time to catch up, and he loses patience with me. So yeah, I'm a bit concerned. I'm going to get left behind. Oh oh Very powerful, very powerful going. And that was that was two capsules next week. So five capsules What are your thoughts about next Wednesday? They're probably more anxious, actually, if I'm honest, because of what came up today. and that I know that could get amplified next Wednesday. So I think there's a battle there that's not done yet. - He was taken back to a very, very difficult memory which he didn't think was a memory. It was kind of a new experience that he was going through of having his mother on the one side and his father on the other having to choose between them. And he went to be with the very calm, benevolent energy of his dad, and he felt the presence of this dad there. He said he actually really kind of met his dad again and felt his dad wrapped around him. He could feel the knit of the cardigan his dad used to wear. So that was a really difficult but also very positive powerful experiences. (calm music) - [Monty] It's a huge responsibility for you, this. Do you get sort of scared or nervous? - I do, I think if you're giving a incredibly powerful psychoactive drug to individuals who are especially vulnerable, you have to think about negative psychological responses. You have to think about anxiety. You have to think about fear and potential panic. (soft music) - [Ros] Let's just carry on breathing naturally. And then I'd like you to imagine that you're lying down in a beautiful woodland. You're in a clearing, and the ground is covered with green most, soft and springy. - I think depression's about like an addict. You learn to hide it from people. (mumbles) people in arms. I don't want no sympathy. I don't even want a lot of kindness. And I would like to go into the bedroom and close the curtains, put the lights off, and just stare. - It's a big day, probably as big a day as our wedding day maybe 'cause this could be the start of a new life, fingers crossed. (Maggie laughing) - In mental health, you just have to go into an inpatient ward anywhere and realize that we need something new. So John and the other patients in the trial have got what's called treatment-resistant depression, which means they've tried three different types of treatment and nothing's worked. I think the name treatment-resistant depression is really a bad name 'cause you can't say that John's depression is resitant to treatment. It's just that we haven't found the right treatments yet. - [Monty] How are you feeling today? - All right, certainly more positive than I was before, I am, but I definitely felt that there was something I couldn't achieve on the first dose. It felt like I could identify there was a problem, but I couldn't quite grasp it or tackle it, you know? It's not like I'm feeling euphoria or high or happiness or, I just don't feel rubbish, you know? And so if this is all it does, then that's fine. But hopefully it'll do more. (soft music) (bell ringing) - I'd just really like to get to the bottom of it or have somebody help me get to the bottom of it. - Difficult to know what to expect. I sort of feel like I don't know him well enough as perhaps we should at this stage, so that doesn't feel ideal. It's the low dose today. Essentially, I know he'll be fine physically, so let's just go into it with the right attitude, really, and support him. - [James] Do you feel ready to take the capsules now? - Yeah, I'm fine to take that. - Here's a glass of water for you, all right? - Mark hasn't really revealed to us why he's depressed. I don't think he knows, and now the taking of this drug is about trying to understand where this is coming from, what this block is. (soft music) - I can't pinpoint a date or an event that could possibly be the cause of it. Over all this time, I think it must be something biological. I don't expect a magic wand, to go, "Wow, you feel all the sudden great, "and you're you for doing anything!" Kind of what I do expect is just not to feel so cripplingly negative about everything that it infringes upon my daily life. (soft music) - Are you hopeful? I am hopeful for Mark because if I wasn't hopeful, that would be a problem in itself. I firmly believe that this drug is a route out of what can other be an insoluble problem. - The nature of the drug effects are that they induce a kind of malleability or plasticity, so like they free things up so that they can change. And I think what can be characteristic of depression is that there are things that aren't conscious and you don't realize the contribution to your state. - Yeah, that all makes, it makes sense. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Well, I hope you have a nice... - Yeah. - And easy evening. If ever you're worried about anything or you just wanna ask anything, you can give me a call. - Okay. (soft music) - There are 16 ways in which drugs can do harm to you or to society. There are nine ways they can harm the user, and those are the blues bars, and the size of the red bar, the harm of the drug to society. So alcohol is the most harmful drug in Europe and the UK, and the reason for that is the size of that red bar. It's not the most damaging drug to the user. Being on to the right, then you have heroin and crack and methamphetamine. They have bigger blue bars. And the drugs that the media get hysterical about, they're on the right-hand. They're ecstasy, LSD, magic mushrooms. They have virtually no harm to society and considerably less harm to the user than alcohol. Making these drugs illegal stops people researching them, even though the UN Convention said, "Oh, no, we're perfectly happy for you "to carry on researching them. "You just have to comply with the regulations." No one has managed to get through those regulations to do clinical trial of LSD in 50 years. - And what do you think does have to happen in order for decriminalization to happen in the UK? Like, is it with a politician, or is it with the research? Is it with the people, what... - What has to happen is we've gotta have completely public debate, and you've gotta hold MPs up to account when they are either not discussing this or talking rubbish about it. And the media, too, you know? When are people lying about the harms of drugs, you've gotta challenge them all the time. (soft music) - [Narrator] Baroness Molly Meacher has spent 10 years as a crossbencher in the House of Lords campaigning for the liberalization of drug laws. - UK governments tend to be very conservative on drug policy, much more conservative than many Western European countries and of course the vast majority of U.S. states. And that's something to do with our media, I think. They've been very hostile to reform in this area, which is probably something to do with the conservatism of the British people. - [Monty] So where are we off to now? - We're gonna go and pick up the capsules. It's the second dose now, so this is where things get even more interesting. It's gonna be quite a high dose, 25 milligrams. - [Monty] And why are they down here? - Oh, it's in, hi, Matt, how's it going? - All right, let's get the key out. - Sure! So the drug has to be stored securely. In order to do research with Schedule I drugs, we a Home Office license, so it's stored in this secure area in a locked safe that's actually bolted to the wall. (soft music) - [Monty] What exactly is this? - This is psilocybin, so this is the psychoactive ingredient in so-called magic mushrooms. - [Monty] How does that compare to the sort of recreational dose? - It's quite a high dose, actually, 2 1/2 grams of mushroom material or you know, hundreds, a couple of hundred little liberty cap magic mushrooms. So anyone doing that, you'd consider really taking quite a high dose, so yeah, there's no messing about. (soft music) (Andy exhales loudly) - So I'm ready for the exam. You can't go on living like you have done for the last 20 years because it doesn't get better. It does get worse. Yeah, when I think back to late November last year, that was about as bad as it had got. And that was, that scared me. But we're beyond that. I'm extraordinarily lucky to be here. (soft music) (Andy crying) - Please go away, please go away! Oh, please go away, oh god, no! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no, no, no! - Hey, Andy. - No, no! - Andy, it's okay. With Andy, if you asked him what had been making him struggle or depressed, he would say experiences with his work and not feeling good enough there, but that didn't even come into the sessions at all, and it was more about his early childhood experiences of suffering in pain. - I need more spaghetti. - Does it want to come inside? - I need more spaghetti. - Okay, what about letting it in? We're here with you, Andy, now. - No, no, no, no, no, no. No, no. - Okay. These kind of early childhood experiences will often be repressed. People can go through their whole lives without ever really facing those demons, but it's not as if the demons they've pushed down don't cause any suffering because they're there. - This is so (mumbles) - Just let it be here and see what it's here to show you. - Oh, god. - And know that you're safe. - I'm afraid it won't go away, won't go away, won't go away. - Just a small improvement would be lovely, just for him to feel differently about things and see the world through a different pair of eyes. (soft music) - [Andy] Hello! - Andy! - How are you doing? (Andy laughs) - How was it? - Yeah, yeah. - Oh! - Extraordinary, extraordinary. - Is that different from last time? - Yeah, yes, yeah, yeah. You knew that this was the big ride. This is the one that changed things. And of course, it's left lots and lots of questions, really, but those I think the answers to those will come out in good time. - Yeah. - Dad was there. - Yes. - Dad was there. - Good. - Yeah. - [Yvonne] Oh, that's lovely. - Yeah, couple a times, actually. Couple a times he was there. - Yes. - Where it was headed was dangerous to me. It was a dangerous path, but no, no. It's all, we're okay now, we're okay. - [Yvonne] You're right. - All is resolved. - [Yvonne] Bye-bye. - See you tomorrow. Cheerio. - Thank you, Monty.♪♪ Have a nice evening. - I could feel that he was suffering so much, but I could also feel that it was really important for him to be suffering, so I was kind of pleased in a weird way that he was (chuckles) going through it, thinking, "Yes, now we're getting to the stuff," you know? "This is what's been causing you so much suffering, "so we need to get it out." And he was really in a battle with a large, dark, evil force that he associated with his mum. (opera singer vocalizing) - [Andy] Get away. Get away. You're not coming in. - There was so much darkness and so much pain. There were moments of thinking, "Where is this gonna go? "How's it gonna be by the end of the day?" You know, what if this doesn't get resolved? There was a sense from the last session of his dad being kind of wonderful, and his mum being kind of terrible and evil. - (laughing) We're all done and dead. I'm telling you, we're all dead, we're all dead. - What sort of evolved out of today is that it really doesn't matter. If there was one person doing right, the other one doing wrong, what actually matters at the end is resolution and love because that is the big thing that came out for me today is that the more you hate something, the more you feed it with that hate, the bigger it gets, and that's what's been going on. I've been feeding this thing, it's been consuming me, and now I've got to the realization that if I stop feeding it with hate, it evaporates, it goes away. Shh, it's, oh, yes, yes, yes. - [Ros] Are you out? - Ah! And as soon as that realization occurred, because I had the representation of my father and Vonnie and the boys on my chest, but I didn't have a representation of Mom. So I took a picture and brought here in to that union, really, at the end, and we were kinda one again, but one helluva a battle. I wouldn't wanna do it again. I've been the happiest ever in my life, and I've been the most terrified in my life in the same day, probably in the space of half an hour. - [Monty] So good. - Mm, really good. Exhausting, but really, really, very good. And I mean, well, the proof is in the pudding, you know? Today was good, it was intense. It was good, it was tough, all the things I hope for, but we will see how Andy's feeling tomorrow, next week. And the really key thing is in a week, a month, few months, that's what's really important. (soft music) - Hi, good to see you, how you doing? - All right, yeah, yourself? - Yeah, we're all right, yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. My mind's been racing about, you know, what could be or how could be. - [Robin] And you have (mumbles) - Oh yeah, yeah, but more about what it could be that's coming (mumbles). - I think we should get into the room well ahead of time and settle down and talk to the others. (soft music) - Okay. - If you remember last time. - Okay. - Last week we had somebody in the study who had a particularly strong response to psilocybin, probably the strongest psychedelic experience I've ever sat with, and that's kind of raised, raised my kind of alertness, really, about today. It's just a reminder, really, never to underestimate the power, really, of a psychedelic drug and the alterations in consciousness that they can induce. - [James] Tell us what's on your mind? - I don't know why, it just feels like it stopped. It feels like it, I just wanna go home, that's what I want. - [James] Just wanna go home. - Yeah. - How come? - I don't know, it just, that's just, I mean. Did you really get... - Today John nearly left, which was quite a dilemma for us because on the one, we want to keep him here and keep him safe, but we also didn't wanna keep him here against his will. And so it was difficult. - [James] It's probably a bit early for you to go as yet. I mean, can you just hold off a little bit longer? - I don't know, just wanna go home today. - [James] Yeah, is there anything at all? - There was just, I think, well, when I close my eyes and try and, I try and sleep, I just will feel like when a bad dream in to the next. That what it feels like. - It wasn't really what I would've planned or expected. I didn't even realize that's what John needed, but looking back, I see it was what he needed. It was like the first dose was like lulling him into it. It gave him a sense of it's okay, I can do this. And then the second dose, it's like, right, now the real work begins. - Okay, I probably should've left. - And the real work isn't experiencing some lovely feeling of love from the world. The work is going on a journey within yourself, finding that nugget of pain, and integrating it into your life. - I'm really hoping and praying that it has worked. Up until now, with John being ill, I've been mum and dad to the kids. And now, it might be that I can share the load again and it won't just be me. It's be me and John working as a team like we used to do all those years ago. - Your wife's over here. - Hello! How're you feeling? (mumbles) 2 1/2. - Really? (laughs) - Yeah. (laughs) Oh, I nearly left. - [Maggie] Why? - It was just, I got upset, horrible. And then they, some very kind people convinced me to stay in the room. (laughs) - [Maggie] Did they tie you down? - [John-] No, no, they... - Really, really. - It was physical. - Actually... - No physical restraint. - I think a lot's been sort of experienced today. - [Maggie] Okay. - And been, yeah, just a little rockier than last time? - [John] Oh, yeah, yeah. - At one point, but I think maybe because of that, maybe there's more benefits being had from this experience... - Yeah. - Than last week. - Yeah, it was bad in terms of what I experienced but necessary for actually... - [Maggie] Does that mean you can get rid of the beard, John? - No, yeah... - Oh! - A miner poked me and said, "Grow it till it's down to your knees!" - Oh! (Robin and John laughing) - At first, I really didn't think it was working. It wasn't until the very end when I could set and then reflect on it that I could see what had happened. All these things that happened to me when I was a kid, it made me face very single one of 'em, and nobody wants to do that. But yeah, so it was an extremely horrible afternoon, the worst experience in my life. Sometimes I could hear bugs, as if a bug was crawling through the ground. The images that I saw was of this massive sort of black-and-red iron thing with huge spikes pointing into it. But the experience that it relates to was when some (mumbles) took my T-shirt off and threw me in this massive patch of nettles, and I was beat with a hawthorn branches, and the bugs that I heard were the bugs that I heard when I was on the ground afterwards crying. The sharp spikes on the big black-and-red thing were the thorns on the branch. It was almost like absolutely everything was trying its hardest to see this is the problem. You know, it makes me feel that depression is a way we cope, as a kid we build up psychological protections for ourself (mumbles) but at some point in your adult life, we have to come terms with that and deal with it, and there is no natural part of life that we have in modern society that allows that to happen. Counseling doesn't do it, antidepressants won't do it. But this thing does do that. It takes you straight there, exactly what Robin promised. It will take you to that place. Whatever the problem is, it will take you straight to that, and you have to decide there and then whether you're going to be a victim of that for the rest of your life or not. - John? - What? - Hi, John. How you doing? - Doing much better. - Great, that's good to know. - Good. - What I was just thinking was it wasn't some external spiritual force, or it wasn't someone's counseling technique. (soft music) It's actually oneself that does the healing in the end. - You look at these images, you can see the cortex. That the outer part of the brain here. And this is a kind of spine to the cortex, and this seem to be particularly implicated in depression. Now, what psilocybin does is to introduce a degree of chaos, if you want, almost like a kind of scrambling effect as a kind of resetting of the brain, and it sort of settles in a healthy mode of function. - [John] Oh, that's the reason for the scans, for the definite... - [Robin] That's what we're doing now, really, yeah. - It's really interesting. - Yeah. (both laugh) (soft music) - [Monty] Tell us whether you'd have been able to walk around London a month ago. - No, I wouldn't have done that. Coming in here, a place in London, the corner of Oxford Street and Regent Street where it's so mobbed, I just wouldn't have done that. I'm enjoying that, you know? It's nice, you're not sitting thinking about yourself or thinking about anything depressing or bad or dark or deep. It feels good, it feels like there's a lightness, you know? That is like a burden that's been lifted. That's what it feels like. It's like someone's just come along, and they've taken away everything that was weighing you down. - Today, I just really wanna get it over and done with, basically. I don't really have any hopes or predictions or ideas about what might happen or really... Let's just get on with it, really, yeah. (light orchestra music) - I feel really tired, hungover. Massively abnormal feelings forming that I've, not sure if I've ever experienced in my adult life. - [Monty] Do you feel like it's something that's, you'd want to work on? - I kinda wanna work on it, 'cause I don't wanna feel like this or yeah, feel like this or how I've felt for the majority of my life anymore. There was nothing that like linked back to like this is what caused your depression. You know, you use these tools and work it out. And it's like it's still a massive mystery to me. - [Monty] And is that disappointing? - It's no more disappointing than every other day, so yeah. (soft music) - How old were you when you came to (mumbles)? - I'm just trying to think. I know the first Christmas I had a red trike, so I'd gotta be 3 1/2 or three. (soft music) Somehow it looked, it's so much smaller than I remember. And you saw the little window on the ground floor. - [Yvonne] Oh, yeah. - That's where I used to sit with Lynn on the stairs listening to a (mumbles) in the lounge. Going into the treatment, I thought, now, is it gonna be the sort of conflict I had at work, or is it gonna be the family? Strangely, I've not even thought much about what happened at work. Well, that was momentous for me then. It's kind of, it's automatically just sort of drifted back to what went on in that house down there. That's where the damage was done. Just give me a minute down here. (soft music) - This is probably the third or fourth time we've been back as a couple to see where he's lived. And all he's ever done is remembered it with fondness. "This is where I grew up, and I loved this, "and I did this, and I did this with Dad." And today, it's just more painful. - A change has occurred, there's no doubt about that. A change has occurred, but it's not, (chuckles) it's not the easy change that I thought it would be. It's a bit as though I had ingested a really, really good therapist. That's what it feels like. It feels of I've got onboard now my own therapist. - [Yvonne] (mumbles) - Okay. - Cheers! - Thank you so much, and thanks for everything, really. - It's a pleasure. - I know it's a work in progress, but you know, I think thing's are moving in the right direction. I'm not sure if it's correct or not, but the way I look at it is that I've been unhappy for so long that I think that unhappiness has spilled obviously into my life and my relationships, and I think there's a residue that's gotta be dealt with. But the other thing was this awful image that I had with the smothering, this awful image that... - [Ros] That your dad didn't want you, the rejection? - [Andy] Yeah, yeah. What is that? - [Ros] Let it happen. - [Andy] Trying to make sure they can pull out the memory. I could actually see the pillow, and then suddenly the realization was, you know, that I'm being smothered. (opera singer vocalizing) Oh, no, Father, no, no. - [Ros] Stay here with us, just let it... - No, no, no, no, no (crying) no, no, no, no, no. That feeling was real, then the realization that it was Dad doing it was real. (crying) Really beat up on me that badly? All I can remember about my dad is good, and that's why I think I can't ever imagine him wanting to dispatch me with a pillow. 'Cause there are lovely memories of getting up at sort of 4:30 in the morning and going on his milk route, you know, these crystal-clear images of those times, and they were really pleasant. - Your mind will allow you to remember those things, those positive memories. - Yep. - Anything that is confusing or conflictual might be something that you'd wanna keep away... - Yeah, yeah. - From your memories and your conscious mind. - Yeah, yeah. Okay. - After you, are we all going? - Often in a psychedelic dose, the person will experience the same fragility, vulnerability, overwhelming horror as they did as a child, so I think that's what happened with Andy. He was stripped of his defenses as an adult and taken back to that vulnerable place. What was real for Andy was his fear, fear of annihilation and sense, huge sense of rejection, and that theme of rejection is something that has plagued him his whole life. So that feels like it's really clinically significant. - Bye now, bye-bye. - Bye! - Bye. - Bye, Monty. - I wish that I would be able to work as his therapist and it could be a longer course of treatment and that we could perhaps have another dosing and keep working on a process, 'cause then I really feel that huge breakthroughs could be made. I hope that from this dose, there will also be a significant improvement. I think for sort of lifelong change, I feel that further therapy and further dosing sessions would probably be required. (soft music) - Finished? - Yeah. - Should we head out? - [Mark] Yeah. (soft music) - One of Mark's major problems is not his depression, but it's the fact that he doesn't know what he wants, and he wants other people to sort of help him and tell him sort of what to do. We've really tried to encourage him to try and work out a little bit what he does want from life, but he, you know, he obviously, he still reports being quite lost. And so it's a delicate balance really, but in the therapy, I think it will be all about trying to get him to have a greater sense of himself and what he wants. (soft music) - I think school was tough for everyone. You know, I used to to in the library and try and read about how to act in public, how to, and it just felt very, very alien, the whole, you know, the whole concept of people having girlfriends, people having lots of friends. Everyone was different, but I felt very removed from everyone. I went to the doctor's, and he said, "Go to Amsterdam," and I was like, "Mate, I'm 14," you know? This is 1984, you're telling me to go to Amsterdam. What you expected me to do there? 'Cause all I knew about Amsterdam were clogs, Anne Frank, prostitution, and drugs, and it's, I didn't think he was telling me to go to the Anne Frank museum, and it was, and I thought, "That's my GP." And now I've been told by doctors, "This is what it's gonna be like. "Nothing's gonna change, you're gonna be like this." And then you think, or you start thinking, "Wow, actually, what's the fucking point, really?" You know, thanks for that. (soft music) - I grew up was a valley called (mumbles) I can still see the field and the hawthorn sort of hedge where it all took place. I could take you straight to the very place. And the thing was it didn't happen that far from my home, but if I ever tried to complain about it to my mum, she would just go nuts, and she would give me a hammering. And then when Dad come home from work, he would come in. Even if you were sleeping, you would get woken up, and you'd be getting another hammerin', you know? That was, I think, being that I really started having sort of emotional problems, I think, as a kid. - [Robin] 'Cause when these things are experienced, they can't be unexperienced, can they? And the typical response is to try and forget them. - Yeah, (mumbles) - Perhaps the healthiest way to live with them is to live with them consciously. - Yeah, because you can't change the past. There's no sense in wanting revenge or no sense in being really angry at those events or other people that done, but just that sense of that's who made me who I am, in part of what made me who I am, you know, - it doesn't feel like there has been some kind of breakthrough. - Yeah, it does feel like that I feel enthusiastic to just go home and start normal things. You know, It's like a just a desire to get up and get going, though, you know, after going - John, Maggie and that children are sharing a single room in a hotel while their home is being renovated after the flood. - Yeah. That's fine. - Thank you. It's got a motion sensor so it just keeps flying itself if you weren't there was Chewbacca. You're late. Let me wait. (soft music) The main imagery (mumbles) firstly we come up here they will not believe us ahead of us, you know I have a dog with a dog. Yeah a long time ago. Lessons efficient got bad. And if he was nice, he was good for laughing I think it feels good. Not normal anymore. Yeah, but weird sounds negative. You mean that you don't know. It's weird. It's just binge having john here because I've been used to live on my own for so long. - Apparently that if you take the full month more from me die within six days, no, you don't - Think that you do need to remember that are some dangerous mushrooms are just like it. So it's not a good idea to agree. The reason it works is because it's about you, but in sort of like along here in the middle, and then suddenly with depression that it sort of becomes really bogged down or negative things all the time. And so what that does is it it kind of shifts all up and then lets it resettle in a different way. But the first it felt quite nice. The second time when I took it, it was a much higher dose. And it was the most horrible thing that I've ever experienced. Might an anemia that lasts for six hours and doesn't stop. - Yeah, that's okay. - And that's that's a danger if you just to say do you want to take it for fun? You don't know. I was lucky that I had Dr. Joe Novotny, who could make sure nothing bad happened. - Before the treatment, yeah, we did have a Dad. But if we did see him, it wouldn't be for very long for like five to 10 minutes and you'd have to go back into his room because you'd have a sore head. Since the treatment, she's got much happier. And, but we all have to be honest. And she's managed to spend time with her husband like we've gone to sleep overs and I've gone sleepovers and it's been mom and dad. They've been having movie nights. They've been sitting on the couch, they've had a couch eat falling asleep on the couch, doing things that they used to do before they had kids before dad had depression. That's new my dad started and not the grumpy old fart in the corner. - [Narrator] Six months after the trial, the results are presented to the media - Ctrl S control is set up a file control as every time you change it. Usually fine. It's the last minute. This is a celebration as well as it is taken four years, yeah, four years here. Three of those years were kind of unnecessary. They're just plowing through regulatory hurdles, but we did it. - And so how important is today then? - Today's the birth of a new era in the treatment of depression. - It's the first depression trial with a psychedelic drug. So it is it's landmark stuff. Nice morning, everyone. Welcome to the SMC for some mornings briefing, and psilocybin an option for treatment resistant depression, and to be published in last psychiatry embargo is 10:30pm. Tomorrow. - The average duration of the illness in this sample was 18 years so many of the patients have had Depression fractionally most of their adult lives, yet, eight of the 12 were essentially depression free, one week post treatment and five remain depression free. Three months post treatment, you can see some relapse in some of the patients. So let's not get carried away. This isn't a magic cure. Even so, the effects at this stage, things look promising. - How would you envisage this thing goes? Would it be kind of a one off treatment? Or would it be repeated? - I think that's what we need to find out. The key question is what to do with the people who got an initial benefit, and then it starts to wane. So we're thinking about trying to set up what you might call a more naturalistic study. So perhaps that those people could then be redosed every three months. And just see if that if the effect came back. I mean, it might it might not depressed people have a view of the world, which is that the world is a nasty, hostile place. And of course, they're right, because it is, but after psilocybin, the progress people tend to view the world the same way in 3D which is is better than it is and that's a great defense. (soft music) - [Narrator] What would be the process for a drug like psilocybin to move from schedule one to schedule two? What are the sort of reasons that it isn't happening? - Yeah, I would say a major reason is because of the United Nations conventions and the scheduled. Under those conventions, that country like the UK tends to follow, and that those conventions very clearly includes psilocybin within schedule one. So to move against the UN conventions, you really need some strong evidence. So it's a sort of chicken and egg situation, if psilocybin will put into scheduled to this would make it much easier for researchers to get hold of it to get a license. You know, the whole thing would be freed up then have lots of research and And if it shows that psilocybin really help people with depression, you'd get changed but getting that research to happen, while is Johnson's shadow, it's very difficult. (soft music) - Do you have any regrets about during the trial? - I suppose really only in the audit revealed to me, I think with a high dose. The experiences were were profound and pretty dark. It introduced me to the flag, but it's something really nasty could have happened. Did my childhood and you can't kind of think that but it kind of leaves you with the feeling of well, was that a case did it, you know, was I was I smothered as an infant, there's two sides of spades that is that well, if I'd not learn that, then maybe the recovery process wouldn't be working hasn't worked. Or does nothing It actually make the whole situation worse. But yeah, I do it again. You know, it's, it introduces you to a possible solution for depression. It was a little bit empowering. It made me well perhaps I'm not just like a passenger on this that he you know, merry go round. It might be that I can actually do something about it could be a whole new way of accessing the the subconscious, the psyche, whatever, whatever it is. John is pretty much like it was before the trial is crap. Put it bluntly hoped the results on the trial would last forever. Because it was, it was so nice because at the back and to a certain extent are my husband back and it's gone again. It's just, it's all gone. That's my favorite one ever just all together. It was really nice. It was a fifth of March. And we've not been out for a walk together since which is kind of sad. If you could write your own and to be honest, I know Robin said that the new way He's went back as bad as they were before but I don't think it would take much longer before I was back here it was the darkness gradually came back. The self loathing comes back, the desire to be cut off from the world comes back. Then what happens is he gets compounded you feel guilty that you are like that. Then you feel guilty that your family have to suffer through that measure he doesn't like to have enjoyable surroundings. Somebody in a mentally I say living in a tenement flat may think Mrs. Potter days I'll do that. The only thing I want is as a room where no windows and a door. You know what, we're just going to shut out and spend the rest your life there. You're a good boy. (orchestra music) So, (mumbles) 7.5. That's for take a night sleeping. Suppose Pan 10s. These are for sleeping. When I don't take us up, learn take one of those. Vice versa. This is Friday four hundreds. We'll take two of those at night. That's lithium. This is a mood stabilizer apparently. So maybe people with bipolar disorder, take that, loperamide help stop diarrhea. So I take about eight of those a day. - Did you have that because of the drugs you're taking? - Yeah, possibly duloxetine 60 mils, this is an antidepressant and (mumbles) 15 by take two of these, I take 30 you know, I want to get better, I want to feel better I want to give to society, I want to be part of society. You know, understand I've got a problem, and I've had it for a long time and it's just like, you live you live daily, and yeah, try and hide yourself away as much as possible. - [Narrator] Two years after the trial, Ros has arranged for additional reintegration therapy for Andy to make sense of some of the visions he had during his high dose was just locked into this farm - Trying to expose me when I was an infant. And yeah, great. That's why I've been depressed in my life. So it was kind of convenient for me to be able to blame my depression on that. But in reality, I think that was quite simplistic, and I think you helped me, but you helped me almost turn that on its head. You've introduced a rationale that I can view the whole experience when you pair of eyes and you know, the chances of dad actually doing that pretty remote. It doesn't stack out with anything because it would have been something that mom would have written in a memoirs which is what I've got, you know, she would, she would definitely written something there that do you realize your dad did this? It's really, really good because I'm not thinking Was he dead? Wasn't it and you know if it was to him, or did he do it because I thought he loved me kind of thing? That's that thought bloopers is gone. I can't thank you enough for what you've done. It has been pretty much life changing. So, you know, really, really? - Thank you very much. Okay. - How was that? - It was good. Yeah, I think it was a good summary of what Andrew has been going through, but also a good example of how this integration process works. - In terms of the smothering, do you think that he would experience it all differently? - Now, I think that the one of the key aspects of the integration process with Andrew was to take some of the pressure out of having to find the definite enter of was it through memory or Is it something that I in my mind just made that in the event itself, what he saw is not that his father was smothering him is that actually became a symbolical representation of his whole childhood in which it looked like his mother was trying to present his father as a bad figure. - There were three parts to Andy's high day session. The first was about feeling unwanted by his father as a baby. The second was about feeling criticized and controlled by his mother as a child. And the third was more about healthy adult position of feeling, compassion and love and acceptance and understanding. After the high day session, Andy went back to that early place of wounding feeling unwanted by his father. He then with marks helping integration has been able to progress forward and stop focusing more on his feelings around his mother in the criticism and control of his childhood. We hope with a bit of time and will work, you'll be able to progress forward to that third stage he did experience which was more about the acceptance and love for himself and for his parents. The wonderful thing about this treatment is that it's able to take you on this journey in the space of a day actually with the integration afterwards whereas antidepressants could never do that. Antidepressants don't give you any insight as to why you're depressed. And once you knew why you're depressed, you know what it is inside, then there's a possibility of processing it and actually potentially getting better. - Psychedelic therapy is not pharmacological therapy is not that we're going to have an experience and then that aggression is going to be gone. The task of breaching what we learned in the psychedelic experience into changes that actually have an influence in our physical and daily life. That is the part that it's for me extremely important and how to do that. It's something that we still don't really know. And I think that is where the challenge for the next two years come. - Sort of out of it. How do you feel glad it's done slightly exhausted, pleased it went so well. On the other hand, a little frustrated that the fact that we can't deliver this treatment, you know when people need it and just being here in central London and being so busy, they say one in 10 people are suffering from depression. That's likely a few people around us right now. It's a massive problem. - So what are the results? - Andy, Mark and john Andy and john showed quite a good initial response, especially john, but then they did back So on average, they were the best responders. But if you take the whole group at three weeks, roughly half were in remission, meaning essentially their depression free After on average, about 18 years of depression, six months six, still depression free. So it's quite promising really. And now they're only depression free sort of two years later. Yeah, yeah, there are. Yeah. So people's lives have just been transformed. It suggests the treatment seems to work at least as well as conventional treatments. What we want to do next is compare it against conventional treatments. We need bigger trials, more rigorously designed trials, double blind randomized control trials. Unfortunately, that's happening now. So a few teams around the world are running these studies, major investments coming in as a multi site trial across Europe, and the US and Canada. 15 different countries. So for things to be expanding to the scale that they are right now is really exciting. - It's definitely one. Speaking to guys on the trial afterwards, I said, Yeah, probably if you'd had a stronger dose or a third dose, you would have had, a breakthrough. But I don't know if I can risk going picking a load of these and sitting in my bedroom tripping my nuts off and going, I've got no support. I don't you know, I don't know what to do in. I did feel as though I failed. I failed the test. Did it not work at all? I mean, obviously, I experienced a major amount of weirdness but it opened up a lot of questions about my like my illness, but it never, never really kind of pointed me in the right direction have any answers? And maybe there aren't any answers. And that's just something I got deal with. - Has that been in the last couple of months? - Well, in the past couple of months has not been as good as it was before, but is still the same person as he was four or five years before. And we just saw that same person again, a few months back. So it was nice that they would do again, it would be nice to have (mumbles) - Do you believe in psilocybin? - Oh yeah, because I've seen what was done and it will make a miracle really we never thought it would be like again and then he took the trial and it was great. Yeah, was was really good. - A few months after the trial that was really good and it was really good to see him happy and the rest of us happy. I think it made him feel happy that everyone else was happy as well. But I don't think it was a bad thing that we saw it like it was nice to see it. But and their memories that we're all going to keep forever asleep. Better seeing those memories and not having them. - [Narrator] Every week thousands of people who could benefit from interventions with these drugs are denied access and that means they will continue with their depressions and their addictions. That is outrageous it, there is no need to limit access of these drugs for medical research. But the current regulations make it almost impossible for anyone to use them. In some respects is worse than before. And we'll some videos that will help this frustration that I can't really take full advantage of that, who's benefited from that level of benefit because I'm (mumbles), my children won't benefit because I'm not walking and showing them what proper father a proper person should be doing with a life to be a productive part of society. Other people who need help to and benefit because money's been spent on me when I can be back a work. - You want me to do the apology at the top the bit of golden rules.
