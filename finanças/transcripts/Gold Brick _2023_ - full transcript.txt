"MEN ARE BORN FREE AND EQUAL UNDER THE LAW. THEN THEY HUSTLE." JEAN YANNE Huh? What? You ever wondered why there's a drumroll at the start of reggae songs? Are you serious? You want to talk about that now? So you don't want to know? Okay, say it, if you're so eager to tell me. The drumrolls are the sound of guns bringing down the walls of Babylon. What's Babylon? Babylon is a city that's plagued by capitalism and corruption. Capitalists. We know how to handle them, don't we? Come on, where is he? Look at that son of a bitch. Go now! Damn it! GOLD BRICK BREUIL & SONS NUMBER ONE IN CHARTRES My name is Daniel Sauveur. I was born in Chartres. Central France. In the middle of nowhere. My mom had one dream. To have a view of the cathedral. And even though it was from a distance, my dad managed to give it to her before leaving us. And the Breuil family took that too. The Breuils, the most loaded family in town. Passed down from father to son. There's a Breuil family in your town too. They're the ones who'll crush you with the heel of their shoe without even meaning to, those assholes. I learned early on that if you want a nice view, there's only one option. You have to hustle to get on top. Especially to get on top of the Breuils. So I began to watch them, to try and understand how they got there. And you know what? - There's actually nothing to understand. - I'm thinking of you. Some people are born with and some without. That's it. In Chartres, there's Breuil & Sons, and way, way further down, there's everyone else. Every Wednesday, Breuil Sr. chowed down at this place with his son, Patrick. That's the little guy there. Although he probably doesn't even know it, we went to the same elementary school. - Two coffees for table four. - Sure. I only have two hands. That guy is Unc. My father's best friend. - He looked after us after Dad died. - Have you seen the kid? And every Wednesday, I spent the day with him, here, at the Beaux Arts, The top restaurant in the cathedral square. I told you to stay in the kitchen. Uncle. Look. Look. Over there. The woman. Mrs. Breuil? See her bag? She's left it behind two Wednesdays in a row. - So what? - I have a plan. Mrs. Breuil! You forgot your bag, ma'am. Oh my, thank you. This is for you. Mother. Here. When you're from Chartres, you learn it early on. The Breuils always win. There was a time people started naming their kids - after their favorite brands. - Dirty bastard. I'm going to kick your ass, asshole! That's how my best friend found himself with the name Scania. Like the trucks. - Let's go! - He hated the Breuils too. After all, his dad worked as a trucker for them, so he never got to see him. When my father died some of the kids at school started calling me "bastard." And Scania made them pay every time. So I share everything with him. Fifty-fifty. See you. When we grew up, we swore never to work for the Breuils like our fathers had. So we set up our own business. And you know what? It actually worked. - All right, brother? - Except here, - all roads lead to... - Breuil & Sons of bitches. Like everyone else, we ended up working for the Breuil family. And way too much. Over 90% of your turnover comes from us. Dependent economically. I'm sorry. It's out of my control. - Hey, hey, hey. Don't. Wait a sec! - Back off! Economic dependency is when you do too much business with one client. - Fucker! - Apparently, that's not good. Hey! Stop. Get out of here! Because we didn't have other clients and owed money to the bank, - Don't touch me. - Shit hit the fan. Can we go, please? After that, we had no other choice. Scania had to take a job as a truck driver for Breuil, I held out another three months but at some point a man's gotta eat, right? What the hell are you doing here? Come on, enough of the smoke break. Give me that. SHIPPING That's him. Is that him? - Daniel Sauveur, sir. - Save the formality. - Here, you call me "chief." - Chief. Well, you tell him how things work? - Mm-mm. - Am I missing something? So, let me explain. You see, over here I'm the authority on who stays and who goes. So, it's simple, I give you a short-term contract for six months. And at the end of that, Papa Breuil will pay you a 10% indemnity, that makes 900 euros. 900 euros and that's it. - There's no trade off or... - It's the law. It's the law. But don't worry, pal. Because you're going to hand over that bonus here. Half paid right now, - half paid at the end of the contract. - Come again? Huh? So if you don't pay, I'll fire you during your trial. You pay, you're all good. I keep you on. Again. Half on end. Half on start. I'm not the kind of guy who has a savings account. Where do I get it? Your buddy here mentioned he could cough up the first round. Thanks. What are you paying off a prick like that for, huh? So that you have a job. And that's how, after taking over the whole town, the Breuils had me. Excuse me. Is this where... Locals see working here as a step up. They reckon they're doing something high-end. The global distribution of Parisian luxury. The quintessence of the French soul. Givenchy, Dior, Saint-Laurent. The whole shebang. Anyway, you get the picture. In reality, those luxury brands just send their perfume to Breuil in cubes, and we put them in bottles, fancy boxes, cardboard boxes and pallets. Then we deliver them to big clients across the world. I started out in quality control for Colin Brown. It's a big American luxury brand. See how ridiculous this stuff is? The black and white ads with guys and gals in jeans. I've seen it all. CB Gold, of course. CB X-treme, when techno was back on the club scene. CB Green for the eco crowd. I even saw CB Red, when guys wanted to smell nice to go and work out. You think I'm kidding? Well, I'm not. - Excuse me? - Hm? What's going on here? The old guy kicked the bucket. Breuil? Let's just say that if there's one less Breuil in the world, I'm not upset about it. But don't forget, the Breuils always win. At the same age as me and having done nothing to deserve it, little Patrick became the big boss. He was all made up with his future all mapped out when I didn't have one. That's exactly when everything changed for me. Hello. I'm Béatrice Breuil, Patrick's wife. A gift from our family to celebrate him stepping in at the head of the company. It's a Bois d'Argent fragrance. Very contemporary. - Excuse me. - Hello. A little gift from our family to celebrate Patrick's new role. What about you, Daniel? How's it going with the perfumers? Is the son better than the father? I'm not sure. Either way, they're really screwing you over. Yeah. They ride us pretty hard. Hey, guess what we heard on the local news last night. A few liters of perfume concentrate can go for the same price as a kilo of gold? No shit. For that price, you better smell good. A bit of water with some kind of dumb flower juice, 30,000 bucks. They think their shit doesn't stink. COLIN BROWN GOLD YOUR SALE PRICE INTERESTED IN THE COLIN BROWN! Scania, I've been watching them every single day, I'm telling you! There's only one moment when the boxes don't get checked. It's money just sitting and waiting for us. Come on, stop with the bullshit. I sold one bottle online and made 50 euros in one second, so why would we miss out on a cash grab like that? I mean, come on. What the hell is there to lose? With or without you, I'm doing it. Okay, but what if Kowalski finds out? Kowalski. That Polack will lead us to a goddamn goldmine. - I know how to handle it. - You're killing me, Daniel. You wouldn't know an opportunity if it hit you in the face. Good evening, Patrick. Jacques-Yves, we're so happy you could make it. He would have been touched. Be proud. Armand was... some big shoes. Thank you, Jacques-Yves. Oh, but let's not go there. Well, you know, since we'll be seeing a lot of each other. What do you mean? I'll swing by occasionally to ensure our products receive the same treatment as they did under your father. I'd really like you to meet, uh, Béatrice. Béa! Come here. My wife, Béatrice. Jacques-Yves Rousseau of Colin Brown. Nice to meet you. My pleasure. - And, uh... - Brice Nougarolis, Parfum VIP. Oh yes, yes, the online discounter. We know who you are. Hey, Chief! Another one of your Polacks ran over my box with his Fenwick. - "My Polack?" - Yeah. Hold on a second. - "My Polacks?" - Yeah. - Hey, guess what, Sauveur? - What? From now on, it won't be my Polacks who take care of the trash. It's Daniel, my good little French helper. - Ah... - So go on, your special trash is waiting. Like David Douillet would say, playing someone is like judo. Yeah, right. You must know how to use your opponent's strength against them. - You okay? - Yeah. Yeah, he's a dick, Chief. - Hey. To the incinerator. - Hello. Fine. Step forward. - Go ahead. - Thanks. Take people who work in offices. When they clock out, they take pens home so that their kids have something to draw with. You don't have a problem with that, do you? So, Scania and I work in perfume, and we don't have kids. Same thing. In six months, we made 10,000 bucks each by selling online. I was able to help out Unc and Mom, and Scania bought me a Rollie. Hey! Hey! Goddamn it. May I have the pleasure of buying you a round? - Mm-hm. - Yeah? Hey! Give us a couple of mojitos, please! - You got it. - Thanks. I'm a regular here, so how come I've never seen that lovely face before? It's because I just moved to Chartres. Oh yeah? You know people usually tend to leave this town, huh? Not come here. What brings you to Chartres? - Work. - Work. Perfume? - Like everyone. - Mm. - Like me. - Oh yeah? - Yeah, yeah. - For who? For who? Uh, for myself, uh... I'm actually the owner of a start-up. And, uh, I'm into selling luxury brands at a discount. Well, that's now. Anything can happen. Uh, so far growth has been incredible. You could say exponential. So, at the beginning we were more, uh... into licensing, uh, B2B. Then we wanted to move into B2C, and we basically went straight to the States. Then we thought, why not, in the short term, flood the metaverse, you know, uh, directly on the internet too. Uh... In the universe, um, the shared universe. Uh, you've heard of it, for sure. And so now we've been trying to, uh... You've got to take a break too. So now we're, uh, we're organizing a little event to, uh, blow off some steam, you know how it is. Because we've already made three million, so, uh... Me and my friend over there, who is a shit dancer, but he's bought himself a little shack. A house for 1.5. Bought it on the Opal Coast. Right there. Out of nowhere. Just like that. Cash. And, uh, there's a whole big group of us in the incubator, like... The "golden boys." Except modern day. I mean, uh, without any guns. And so we say to ourselves, "Okay, the risk is we lose our minds." So, if that's the risk, we better not. All right, how 'bout it? - What do you think? - About? About dinner, Monday at 8:00, at the Beaux Arts or some other place? No. - 8:30? - Thanks. 8:30. A bit later? Hey, hey. Well, well, amigo, is that a Rollie you have there? Let me see. It was a birthday gift from my mom this year. - Hand it over now. - No, no, Chief. Your contract's up for renewal. You're 2 days late. Where's my 500 bucks? I'll pay tomorrow, I swear. I don't do credit. Well, hey, I like that. You know, trash suits you. I wouldn't want anyone else for the job. You're a natural garbage man. Now, move. Son of a bitch. What? USERS REPORTED THE SALE OF COUNTERFEIT PRODUCTS FROM YOUR ACCOUNT. Fuck. Daniel? Shit. Shit! Daniel? What? - Come down! - Coming. Lieutenant Faillard, national police. We were called over here off a tip from customs. Customs? I've never crossed a border in my life, there must be a mistake, this can't be the, uh, correct address, right? Have a computer? No. What's your job, Daniel? Uh, right now I work over at Breuil & Sons. - Ah, Breuil? - Mm. Doesn't mean anything, the whole town works in perfume, so it's... Who said perfume? It was you. You asked me if I worked for Breuil and we make perfume, so I said "perfume." Oh, is that why you're, uh... For now, it's very... So, the... Since Breuil Jr. took over the company, and his wife, um, very generously gave us a bottle of perfume. Each of... All of the employees. And because I don't, um... Because, um, I don't use this brand... I thought, uh, I should sell it on the internet. I sold it for 50 euros. Because I... I did, It's true. That is true. I told my friends about what I did. And so everyone wanted me to sell theirs too. But it was all really, uh, temporary. I wasn't planning, you know, to do it regularly or anything. That might be why you saw those sales, you know... multiply. - On the internet? - On the internet, yeah. Without a computer? Without a... Uh, yeah. So, I borrowed a computer just for, uh, for that. Uh, I told your colleague, we have never had one. Right. Although it would be useful to get one to... To buy stuff and all. Fencing counterfeit goods lands you five years in prison. And a 375,000 euro fine. I'll be good, officer. I can't call you, the cops tapped my phone, man. You serious? How did they figure out... They searched the whole house, they know everything about the internet. That angle's gone now, it's over. What about the 200 bottles I have? I'll have to figure something out, I guess. In any case, we need to make some money as soon as possible. I need to get out of my mom's place. I'm not getting her involved in another mess. - Hold on, it's Kowalski. - Go, go, go. Come in. Ah... Uh, I don't see you in my calendar, Mr. Sauveur. Oh. You... You know my name? Did you... Did you look for it? On the HR system. Oh, right, right. - Take a seat. - Sure, thanks. Weird that we haven't run into... Run into one another in the halls. So, where were you before? You... I was with Breuil, but at the office in Paris. - Ah. - Then Mr. Breuil called me in here as general manager. Oh, yes, GM. - Well, congratulations. - Thanks. So, the other night, did you go home with another guy? - We're not discussing that. - No? We won't talk about it. Anything else? No, it's just I wanted to, you know... - Set things straight. - Not necessary. No. Just for me. For, uh... Just to tell you that, well, that whole internet talk, I had just completely... I'd been drinking, so I was talking out of my ass and... You know, I don't even own a computer. It didn't make any sense. It was completely nuts, so I wanted... I'm sorry. Drinking makes me... extrapolate. You know? I don't really know but I have a meeting in five minutes and you've set things straight, so let's end here. But we'll have an opportunity discuss your personal development eventually. Sure thing, ma'am. And just, well, one last little thing. Uh, about dinner, we still on? Oh, no. - No? - No. - I don't mix business with personal. - Because I'm a warehouse worker? Is that a problem? - I never said that. - Oh. It's a little humiliating. But hey. You start to get used to it. Shall we say 8:00, I'll come pick you up, babe? What are you doing? - Have dinner with me... - Are you crazy? You could do much worse. A quick meal, what's the harm? We'll see. Don't do that here. - We'll see? - Get out. - "We'll see" means "we'll see." - Leave. You didn't eat them last time, they just got left in the fridge. Hello. Uh. These look great. Excuse me, how much are the beets? Great. I'll take four. iPhones, iPads, all the best Apple packages, get them here! Come on, we've got luxury watches! - How much are these? - 30 euros, ma'am. They're quality. Of course it's a brand, sir. It's French and it's a luxury product. The latest iPhone, get it here! For 350 euros, it's yours, my friend. Is it real though? 350 euros. 300. All right, give me 300. All right, we're good. Have a good day, my friend. - Discounts, get it here! - Take a look. We've got the real thing. - All the Apple products. iPad! iPhone! - Hold on. I'll head to the truck. Get them here! Good afternoon, sir, interested in anything? APPLE STORE PARIS-OPÉRA - Think you could rip us off? - Not the teeth! - Shut your mouth, asshole! - Let go, let go! Just listen. Listen! Wait a sec, wait! Tell me when it's been 30 seconds. And you tell me when to start counting! He's getting loose! Shit, hold him down! Grab him! Stop! I have 200 perfumes worth 100 euros new, I'll sell 'em to you for 50. - You'll make five grand in a weekend. - You think I'm gonna believe you? They're luxury products, guys! They're Colin Brown. Chill. Come on! Why didn't you come talk to us at the stall, bro? - I'm not an idiot. - Come on, get up. What are you doing? And that's how I replaced the internet with Titou and Raoul. You have to admit, there's nothing better than selling direct. Right. We'll say 50% at the end of every month. Yeah, but we only ever did it the one time. Right? - Mm-hm. First time. - Yeah. You take 15 units ten times a week. Six hundred units per month at 60 euros a piece. That makes my cut 18 grand. Uh, but we don't sell the units at 60 euros, Chief. Mm, mm-hm. You're a real asshole, Sauveur. Huh? Don't touch me. Tomorrow. Fuck, tomorrow... I got it. Hm? - Who's this? - It's us. He came out for the money. Come in, we're not doing this outside. I'd never have thought losers like you would pull something like this off. - Asshole. - All right, come on. Come on. Wait, wait, wait! Daniel! Calm down. - Daniel! Relax. Stop. - Damn it, you're done. I'm going to make sure you get screwed in jail. Listen. Scania's cousin at social security loved your scam with the short-term contracts. Call him. - Yeah, I'm about to. - We'll explain it all to him. You're gonna tell him you've seen the error of your ways. - Here. - Okay, I get it. - You got it? - Yeah. You'll claim disability for six months. I'll take this back. You won't be needing it for a while. There. And now you keep your fat mouth shut, and we'll keep business moving as usual, got it? Jesus, come on. In the time it took to replace Kowalski, we had an open playing field. So we increased productivity to the point that my little friends at the market, Titou and Raoul... Get a fucking van! I've seen bigger kid's toys! ...they struggled to keep up. As for me, I finally got to leave my mom's place and rent a back house, just for myself, at Croix Bonnard, where Cosmetic Valley executives live. So, do you like it, Mr. Sauveur? - All the electrical appliances are new. - It's in good shape. Everything's perfect. Perfect, Mr. Sauveur. Is the file okay? - Great. - Enjoy your holiday. Check this out. You're going to be comfy here, huh? Here. To Breuil. If I understand correctly, with this robotic rotating inventory, the robots continuously scan all of the boxes, but not the contents, correct? Yes, that is correct, Miss van Stratten. So there's a high proportion that won't be monitored. - Hm. - 1.1% across the entire stock. - Marginal. - Marginal? - Mm-hm. - 1.1% is a lot of products, bearing in mind the numbers we handle. If we want to stay in the race here, or even, let's go crazy, if we want to win this race, we have to move more products more quickly. Okay. So I'm the only one here who sees that 1.1% of 4.5 million perfumes we handle a year represents over two million euros worth of perfume that is left unmonitored. Or maybe you're the only one who doesn't see that we're dealing with 200 million euros here. Hmm. Stéphane is right. Innovation has always been a part of the company's DNA. - I say go for it. - Yes! - Thank you, everyone. - Great job. Thank you. Thanks, Patrick. Honey, are you getting your bearings? Today, I gave the green light to a project to digitalize the inventory. Oh? It'll allow us to grow internationally. But I don't know. I've wanted to ask you something for a while but I was waiting For what? I've always known... that you weren't cut out to take over. And that your father was pushing things a little. What's your question? The other day when we were at the Beaux Arts, well, Brice Nougarolis put an idea in my head. Nougarolis? I meant to ask you what the hell was he doing there. He's a perfume discounter, everything Dad hated. He's the biggest online retailer on the continent. - You want me to go online too. Is that it? - Listen, I'm serious about this. So what then? He said that he... He'd give everything to be in your shoes, at the helm of a giant cruise liner. Something lame like that. I'm not following. What are we discussing? I think Nougarolis might like to buy Breuil. My father and grandfather's company? But your father is dead. Your grandfather for even longer, and... So you want to sell and afterwards do what? Whatever we like. Your father always stood in the way of you and your projects. But that's over now. - So sell. - Hmm. Don't you see we need this? A fresh start. Are you talking about the three of us? Are we finally thinking about kids? Hm? - Everything's retranscribed there? - That's right. - Hello, Sauveur. - Hey. - How are you? - Good. What's going on here? I have some good news for you today. Your job is going to be taken over by an infallible scanner that won't get tired of watching all those products go past all day long. I don't get tired. I'm fulfilled by my work. I said it at the last meeting. I don't want to change positions. Always the same with you guys. You complain before you get it. Kowalski's on disability for six months. So you are the new deputy. You're gonna help Lablonde who's replacing him as manager. You're moving up in the world. I... I don't want to move. HR didn't even warn me. What is this? It's random... This comes straight from the top. - Breuil? - Patrick, yeah. - Fucking Breuil. - What did... What did you say? The French economy has created over 100,000 jobs... Whoa, hey, where... Where are you going? The incinerator. The dumpster's full. No, no, sit down. Why? You're the deputy now, Sauveur. Trash duty is for the warehouse workers. I won't just twiddle my thumbs. I've been sitting on my ass for an hour. I don't mind helping out a little, Boss. Well, no, that doesn't work for me. Collective agreements, you know what they are? - Well, yeah. - Right. Well, it's not just your right to sit on your ass all day. It's your duty here. Look, do you know how many guys have seen the wrong end of a cop's baton just to save your ass? So don't mess things up for us here, okay? - Okay. Okay, okay. - Sit down! ...there's also a problem with recruitment, which remains perhaps the most difficult... I left my whole life here behind to go to Paris on a training course because you asked me to. You bring me back here, and you give the job you promised me to an idiot. Stéphane isn't an idiot. He's qualified. Working with him is an opportunity to increase your skill set. - Increase my skill set? - Virginie. It's a matter of management. You want to talk about management, Patrick? Let me ask you a question I was given during the training I lost a year of my life for. Concentrate. In your company, who do you fire first? The smart person who works hard, the smart person who does no work, the asshole who works hard, or the asshole who does no work? Hmm. It's the asshole who works hard there, because he does the most damage. - Hm. - Now... imagine if in this company, the asshole is the one with all the power. Hold on, are we talking about Stéphane here? Whoa, Sauveur, where are you going? - Get back here. - Fuck, how do they do it? TONIGHT? VIRGINIE VAN STRATTEN PACKAGING TROPHIES That's her, the one with Gégé. Well, your sweetheart is already drunk as a skunk. But when you come over, don't say that kind of stuff. You understood everything? You got the champagne, right? Okay, I'll head over. You couldn't resist... coming here. How are you? I'm just great. He put a business school graduate in my place. What, a kid? What? I didn't even see it coming. I'm so dumb. Didn't see it, even though I did everything right. And I believe people who make me promises, but actually people don't give a shit about keeping promises. And then suddenly you're the fool. Like me. What are we talking about? I'm confused. Did you want to work here? I don't understand. I told you that Breuil made me come back to become general manager, right? - Yeah, right. - There you go. In the end, Breuil decided to give the general manager role to another guy. - Ah. - Right. Because what is Breuil really? He's a huge asshole. The Breuils are a family of assholes, everyone knows that. No, no, no. If you could just lower your voice, please. Come with me. Let's talk outside. I'm sorry. That wasn't exactly a great first date. Second. The first wasn't a raging success, was it? What? Do you want revenge on Breuil? I wouldn't know how to get it. If you could? - For real? - Mm-hm. Mm, yeah. I'd really like to kiss you. What's the connection? Well, because I think I'm going to take a... really huge risk for you. I'm going to put it all out there. Don't ask me why. I just knew I had to do it. A champion's instinct. Just... Those barcode readers that scan the boxes? - Yeah? - How do they scan the bottles inside? I don't understand. Well, the robots scan the contents. - What do you mean by the contents? - The boxes. So they don't count the bottles. That's dumb. Yeah, but it's fast, and that's all they care about at Breuil. This is a pallet of 27 boxes. Listen. When we prepare an order, we either take a whole box, or we pick stuff out of a box at the top of the pallet. Because we scan the whole box rather than what's inside, it tolerates a margin of error because it doesn't know how many bottles are inside. And that margin of error, at present, is 1.1%. Listen to this, it's genius. So if we lift less than 1.1% of the entire stock, the system won't register an error and won't set off any kind of warning. And 1.1% equals millions. Just waiting for us. 2.5 million to be exact. 50,000 bottles. Have you lost your mind? We can't lift that many. But why not? 50,000 bottles of perfume. That's no small-time theft. No. 50,000 bottles is nothing to Breuil. No. No way we're gonna get caught. Look. Give me the notepad. We just need to find ten people. We can build a team. Why ten people? How are you going to find ten people? I'm your only friend in the place. To bring people into this kind of thing, you need... You need to know them. - Otherwise, it's... - Scania, Virginie's job is to find people and recruit to the warehouse. It's not her job to recruit people to steal from their boss. Do you know anyone who would refuse an extra month's salary handed to them on a platter like that? An extra month's salary every month. Remember what we always said? Our dream was to take them out, the Breuils. And now, with this here, they'll lose 2.5 million euros. It would be criminal not to take them for every last cent we possibly can. Okay, maybe. But we still need to find ten people. - Okay, yeah, that's good. - Yeah. They won't be a problem. We can trust them. Oh no, we're not taking him. Hey, we're not taking Lablonde. He's not joining. There's no way. Oh no. Yeah, we're taking him. So, Virginie taught me something. Out of the 26 million workers in France, 800,000 are Buddhists. I know, sounds like bullshit. I've never heard anyone mention anything like that. Bear in mind there are twice as many Buddhists as the 400,000 workers registered with the union who break our balls all year round. Which tells you something about the strength of annoying people. If the union at Breuil came up with the idea of hitting us with a week-long strike, we wouldn't get shit out and we'll lose even more dough than Breuil. She was right. We needed Lablonde on our team. He was the union rep at the company. Konnichiwa, Morimoto-san. Konnichiwa. Like they say in Japan, "Rain falls harder on a leaky roof." So, my business had to run like a Swiss clock. I found that the trick was to slip a duplicate of a big order into the pile of orders that had to be prepared. That one there. If we were caught, it could be passed off as a small printing error. Could happen to anyone. Mr. Lablonde! This is the amazing chief of the stock. I love this guy. Once we had the ten guys in our pocket, each time a new pallet went out, it kicked off with Lablonde deciding which team prepared that order. That's Annie Boss, supervisor. She makes sure the list of products to be stolen gets into the right hands. Franck Shoumi, the Schumacher of forklift drivers. I timed each of them ten times. There's no one faster. He's in charge of quickly lowering the top pallets. - The ones no one ever dips into. - And... there. See how it's all automated. Order preparation, huh? With our friends. The Secco twins. Fabrice and Fabien. Known for their flexibility. Their job is to take stuff from the bottom of the pallet. The point of which is to delay the discovery of the missing products in the stock for as long as possible. It's very easy for the surveillance team to notice if two identical big orders are being prepared at the same time. It never happens, so that would raise the alarm. It's very difficult to buy off the security. It's a private company that rotates guards. But watch Yasmina and Déborah carefully. Yasmina goes down the list of products to be put in boxes from A to Z. And Déborah goes up the list from Z to A. The guys monitoring the cameras don't even bat an eye. Me neither. So that must mean it's all good. See the A4 sheet that Mickaël is slipping between two boxes there? Don't forget that the truckers and dockers aren't allowed inside the warehouse. That's the sign I came up with so we can identify the pallet that needs to be diverted after the gate. All right, let's watch. Watch this. It's going to turn now. There. All done. There you have it! There you have it. 27 boxes of 72 bottles. I'll let you do the math. That's it. Lablonde validates the dispatch, and all Mourad, our docker, has to do is divert it to the right truck. You're good. I'll take that back in. And our driver... You know him already. For the math geeks out there, we lifted two pallets of 1,944 bottles a week. On the market, that's 388,000 bucks in cash, every month. [music fades[ How about you come by the house with me tonight? No, I'm not good at meeting people. But it's what you do for a living, isn't it? It's not the same. What, you can't handle it? - Come on, don't push, Sauveur. - So, what? I'm in as deep as you are. I'm just more cautious. We don't know where all this will lead. Yes, we do. We're gonna rip two million off Breuil Jr. I'm not talking about that I'm talking about after. Sure, well... We'll take our money and we'll leave this town and then I guess we'll... We'll see. You hardly know me and you want to run away together? I know enough. And you think I'd leave it all behind for a warehouse worker? Yes. No? Yes. Come on. They're waiting. If by chance you want to set up a business like mine, just a little word of advice, take space into account. Because I guarantee that two pallets per week takes up a whole load of space. And one last thing, make sure to keep an eye on your team. And don't forget the worst rich person is the one who used to be poor. From the first payday, every member of my team opened up the bullshit floodgates. And let me tell you, I mean big time. Shoumi got it into his head to have cooking lessons with the chef at Beaux Arts. How's it going, Daniel? A Michelin star chef charges at least 300 bucks an hour. As for Lablonde, the commie of cosmetics, his vice was betting on horse races. You good, Daniel? So, uh, please don't give me all the 200 euro bills this time, okay? That clown blew all his money on bad tips from his union buddies at the bookie. Right on. Love that at the café, huh? And every night, Mickaël bought rounds at the Pharaoh with his dear cousin Yoni, who came up with the brilliant idea of showing up at Breuil in a brand-new Audi. They're just friends. They're leaving in five minutes. But there was one thing that really made me lose my shit. Don't worry, I won't post it. When I saw Instagram stories of Yasmina and Déborah ripping off stores on Avenue Montaigne. That's when I decided to take matters into my own hands and buy my neighbor's house. Here he is, Santa Claus. You're late, I need some dough. Give me two seconds, my friend. They could blow as much money as they wanted, nothing was leaving this place. Why would they want to buy all this shit? Bunch of hoarders. Every Friday, Scania and I paid everyone. Okay, how did this all fill up? Those idiots are costing us a lot. And every Friday, things got wild. Here you go, big guy. Going for 50 euros, ladies and gentlemen! Because she's nice, yeah. That's sweet, thanks. Special price. Hey, big guy. Both for 50 euros. Quality perfume at a cheap price! 50 euros! Two for 40 euros. Give me your 40 euros. Hand 'em over. Here's to you. Hello? Hello? We do what we can, Daniel. But you're pushing it too much, bro. No more. Tuesday, Moulins. Wednesday, Mâcon. Thursday, Montbéliard. Friday, Montargis. Saturday, Montivilliers. What do we do, bro? You've done the towns starting with M. So move on to N! We were reaching our limit. But that didn't bother anyone. All they cared about was their Friday night fiesta. I was only thinking about one thing. Finding a way to grow bigger and bigger. And you know what? I came up with it all by myself. Jesus. The magic child. Jesus was Yasmina's half-brother, and his cute little vice was orgies. And during his escapades, he'd made friends with two directors of the Bergamini stores, the Italian Sephora that had just set up shop in France. He even took care of talking them into doing business with me. So, we had to structure things. The first problem I had was storage. And whenever I have a problem, Scania has a cousin. How's it going, Pierrot? He was a dairy farmer and as broke as they came. How's it going? All right? Poor guy had enough of eating what he could hunt, so he jumped on the chance to rent out his hangar. - Perfect. - Other than Scania and I, no one knew where the stock was. It was better that way. - You serious? - All we needed was our own truck to deliver to Bergamini, so I cracked open the piggy bank. - Is that for me? - Come on! I used my little LLC, I sold all my stock to Bergamini like any other local company. I sold them 20% cheaper than Breuil. Apparently, billionaires say, "The first million is the hardest." Well, not for us, I can tell you that. Tax-free overtime, the pride of France. That was us. I mean, who would want something like that to end? Béa. Béa. Hm? Oh, what? - We have a huge problem. - What's wrong? Last night, after signing the preliminary agreement with Nougarolis, I called you, remember? - It's me. - And? They just left. Is it a done deal or what? There are just a few formalities, account audit, stock inventory by auditors... And then the sale will be complete. In a month's time. Right, and? It was going well. Then what happened next? So once I'd left, I heard a loud noise from the warehouse. What noise? You know, we had a metal sheet come off the roof a few months back. Yes, you mentioned leaks. Leaks... in the warehouse... So with all that water, he wanted to... He wanted to go take a look... And he found... He opened 20 boxes... by chance... All empty. Why didn't you call the police immediately, Patrick? Well, Béa... Because I'd just signed a binding agreement with Nougarolis. And if he hears about all this before I find the missing stock... We're fucked. You know what that means? It means that after the stock inventory, I'll be able to buy up Breuil at half the price. Empty shelves sell for much less, even when it comes to perfume. What are you trying to say? First, I get myself a job at Breuil, as an ex-con entering the job market. That always attracts the thugs. I identify the thieves, I infiltrate them, and I report back on the state of the missing stock. There's no magic behind it. Great. You won't reveal your source. It's your business. But did he or she give you any detail that might have drawn your attention? Bearing in mind your deadline, it could save us time. There might be something odd. Two, three weeks ago, Patrick came home all upset because an employee took his spot in the parking lot. It wasn't the poor guy's fault, it was... I was the one who took down "Reserved for Armand Breuil" after the old man died. - Two minutes, I'll run and get him. - Sure. "Two minutes," huh? One minute, sure. The odd thing is it was a warehouse worker but he was driving a luxury car. An Audi TT, I think it was. Sorry, Boss, but your sign was gone so I thought that... - Mmm. - I just didn't want it to get scratched. Okay, okay, it's fine... An Audi TT. That's more than I need. All things considered, we should be able to close this for you in just a week. Precisely what I wanted to hear. From here on out, I'd like you to call me Ange. You good? You all right or what? What do you have to eat? Okay, where have you been? You look like a wreck. Daniel's been looking for you all morning. Yo, are you listening to me? Hey, you can't just show up here at lunchtime every day. You know Daniel's gonna replace you. You hear that, Yoni? Screw Daniel. Oh yeah? Hey. Screw you, from all of us. Because of you, we couldn't get the shit out today. Now we'll only get half our money. Half. So, what's your excuse? I'm in love. - I'm outta here, so I don't punch him. - It's no big deal. - Are you dumb, or what? - What's your dad's problem? He's annoying. - Did you hear what you said to him? - It's 8:00, man. What do you mean, "8:00"? It's noon. Fuck, have the clocks changed, or what? - Who is it? - The girl from the coatroom. - At the Pharaoh? - Yeah. - Isn't that the bouncer's girl? - Not between 3:00 and 5:00 a.m. He'll beat the hell out of you. - I can handle myself. - I'd like to see that. She's hot though. Don't talk about my girl like that! Get out there, motherfucker! Leave him alone. - Hey! Hey, what are you doing? - Bruce, leave him alone! Piece of shit! Get off of him! - Stop! - Beat the shit out of you. She's my girl. - Stop it! - Let me go! Stop! I'm begging you. Leave him alone. Leave him alone! Fuck. What the fuck is this ex-con doing? Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Hey. Hey. What are you doing? Well, I don't know, Boss. - I was told to fill the... - Who told you that? Look, go see Lablonde. He'll move you. You're done with this. What's your cousin up to? He's left me high and dry twice this week. This time, it's serious. He's in hospital. Huh? - He's out for two months. - No way. What? What the hell did you do? We came out of the Pharaoh last night and he got beaten up by some guy. You can't be serious. We can't slow down at this point. - I know. I'm sorry, but it's not it's... - Just shut up. We need to get a pallet out at 2:00. How do you expect to manage on your own? Any ideas? I don't know. You'd better tell Yoni to stay tucked in bed. I don't want to see him, he's fired. - You tell him. - Daniel, it's not... Hey! Excuse me. Can I, uh, talk to you for a minute? So, tell me, what were you in prison for? - I was a driver. - A driver, hm? Okay. Were you armed? - It's easier than using bare hands. - Right, right, yeah. And, uh, did you shoot? - AK-47, you only have to show it. - Okay. And how many years did you get? Eight. Four on probation. Ah, so you talked? - Good behavior. - Okay. Okay, and now, uh, would you like to make an easy 500 euros, or...? - No, forget it. Not interested. - No, really. I mean it, zero risk, it's completely clean. You'll have your 500 bucks at 2:00. It's easy. Hm. You interested? Hm. Cool. Go see Mickaël over there, next to the machine, he'll explain. Hm? That was the best idea you could come up with? - Hire an ex-con. - I mean, you could have spoken with us. Look, as long he does the job, that's good enough for me. Okay? - Is he doing the job, Mickaël? - Yeah, yeah, he's doing well. Okay, fine, but if he tries to look good and tells his PO, what do we do? - His what? - His PO. Probation Officer. What if he hands us over to reduce his sentence? Okay. Actually, he's involved now. He has more to lose than we do. If there's a problem he'll get sent back to jail. - We don't risk anything. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's all really nice, but, um, how will you pay him? For now, I'm giving him Yoni's share. After that, we'll see. Whoa, whoa, hold on. That's not fair! Not fair? Weren't you supposed to look out for your nephew? Hold on a second. So you're paying him as much as we get? Seniority counts for nothing? Whoa, you're constantly plugged into the news. I think it might be frying your brain, my friend. What, do you think this is the negotiating table at a meeting for the trade unions? Well, now that you mention it, that ex-con is a risk that involves all of us. And I say we take a vote. - And I vote against. - Same. There's been a misunderstanding. There's no voting here. You have to suck it up and put him on the schedule with Mickaël. That's it. Save your breath and get with the program. What I'm about to tell you is extremely serious. Mm-hm. I've found out that we're being robbed. - Here? - Products. A lot of them. And it's probably happening as we speak. Come on, Patrick, there's no way. We have the best security system in the valley. There's no doubt about it. It has to be an employee. And no one knows them better than you. I want you to analyze the HR database to look for suspect profiles. - Even those who've been here a while. - Yes, of course. I promise if we get through this together, this time you won't be forgotten. - In a nutshell? - He knows everything. No. He asked you to dig around, that's totally different... Semantics. You don't know him. The man doesn't let anything go. Breuil doesn't let anything go? You think it's funny. I have to see him face-to-face. - Yeah. - What do I say? You know it's untraceable. Right? Every single pallet we take, it passes through the normal channels. So if, at any point there's an error, it's an order that was duplicated and that's all. An error. You... You just need to rationalize it. - Rationalize it? - Yeah. We are in the absolute deepest shit with Breuil. Do you get that? Don't you think you're being over-dramatic? It's just a matter of time until he figures it out. We're lucky enough to have notice. We should cool things down. Not yet. What I found out last night is big. Very big. Okay, give me names, addresses. I have a promising lead but I need a little more time before I can give you a full report. Right, but we'd agreed on a week. Didn't we? I'm still looking for the stock now. I'm going to find it one way or another, but this isn't a small operation. Sure, but that's your problem. Mine is to get my money's worth. Mr. Nougarolis, I don't earn a living on my fees alone, but with the bonus I get. In the meantime, the tally is at 5,000 a week. Don't make me laugh with your bonus. If you prefer, we can call it a day. You want to play like that? With me? You know, you're not very smart for a PI. You tell me people are stealing, and that the audit will confirm that, but that's not enough to make Breuil squirm. I don't need your shitty little file. Know what we're gonna do? We'll call it a day. I'll work things out with my contact. We're finished. Sure about that? - Yeah, that's how it is. - Okay. If you prefer, we can call it a day. I'm not following, Patrick. First, you wanted to move fast, and now you want to delay the sale six months? You're going to lay off some people when you merge Breuil & Sons with Nougarolis. But some of these people have been with our family forever. So I'd like to get as many as possible somewhere else. That's less work for you. It's true that layoffs are always a drag. But hey, do you know this one? Who would you fire first? - The smart guy who works? - The asshole who works. I need six months. Volluto? No. You know, ever since I was just a little kid, I can sense people's energy. It's a kind of gift I've always had. And I see a lot of suffering in you. Too much emotion. And you, Patrick must free yourself from that as soon as possible. So we keep the deal as it is. KP2M will come take stock inventory by the end of the month, and we will close the sale as agreed. Breuil's freaking out. He's increasing security all over the place. - Can you please stop talking about it? - What would you like to talk about? There's a security team arriving next week. So what? We adapt. Okay? Are you stupid or what? Breuil knows exactly what was stolen. If one person rats on the rest, you'll all go to prison. Why'd you say "you"? What do you mean? Why not say "we"? - Did you make a deal with Breuil? - Stop, now. Huh? At least tell the others. Yeah, but they'll freak out over nothing. Leave them out of my business, okay? - Your business? - Yes. It's not a business at all, Daniel. You're not the boss of anyone. You're a petty thief that steals a lot. Okay, listen. I'm not going back to pushing pallets for Breuil. This is my way out. Maybe it's just a bit of fun for you. Excuse me, fun? You have no idea what I've done to get here. For me, it's a simple decision. I'm stopping here. And you should do the same thing. Let me remind you that if it wasn't for me, you'd still be selling three shitty perfumes at the market. - So now you have to listen to me. - Listen? What exactly do I owe you? Go on, tell me what I owe you. Yeah, you're right. You owe nothing. I don't owe you anything. Lashing out like that really says something about the kind of person you are. You're so desperate to fit into the mold with your business pals, you're all stuck in your head, you've forgotten what actually matters in life. What's that, money? Panache. Fucking asshole. - Hello? - Mr. Breuil, I work for you, and I know who's stealing from you. Mr. Breuil? Are you still there? Yes. Yes. Like I just said, I know who's stealing from you. I know that you've had a lot go missing. And I also know how much that could compromise the sale of your business. You should know that I can help you. - That's my job. - I just need the stock. I absolutely need to find my stock and put it back. I'm working on it. I can get you out of this in good shape if you're willing to pay the price. 500,000 up front, 500,000 when I deliver the file. It's nothing compared to what's at stake. Mr. Breuil? I heard you. Whatever happens, it's essential that you don't talk to anyone about this. And who do you think I'm going to talk to? OPEN THE RECEIVED FILE I'm sorry, Mr. Breuil. Now, listen carefully to what I'm about to say. I'M SORRY PLEASE CALL ME VIRGINIE? Hello? - Breuil knows he's getting robbed. - What? - Fuck. - Is this a joke, Daniel? But, on a positive note he doesn't know it's us. But I hope you've set a little aside because I think this source has run dry. - Uh, no. - Yeah, right. Well, I have a solution to propose to you, but it means doing things a little differently. - How so? - I'll tell you. Lablonde, can you confirm that we have 38 tons going to Sephora Paris Rivoli this weekend? That's... It's... That's for... No, well... I don't know. Just wait. - I don't have the schedule. - Right, okay. I prepared the orders for Mother's Day. two of the trucks are packed full. They're carrying 40,000 units each, all right? So, I propose... - we make them disappear. - How we gonna do that? Meaning what exactly? I'm in! What if they trace it back to us? What do we do if they catch us? They won't trace it back to us. As far as everyone else is concerned, the trucks have been stolen. By a group of professionals. What? And who... Who's going to do that? Because it's... We are. Huh? No way, you're crazy! - Hold on... - Huh? A truck's just a big van after all, right? Ange, this is your specialty. So, the 80,000 units will be in storage until they're sold off. It's worth 2.5 million. And this time we'll split it evenly. We have two days to get ready. Who's with me? Oh sure, so now we get a vote. Shut up. 200,000, huh? Get down! Get down! Get down! - I don't want to die, Mister! - Oh, shut up! - Shut up! - Yes. Yes, sir. No! No! Give me your hands. I said shut the fuck up! - Shut up! - Stop! Stop it. Never drop your weapon. How do I get the thing on, if I... Never put down your weapon, or you're dead! Is that clear? Can I have a go? What? You? Uh? Wow. - Hey! Are you crazy, or what? - Get your hands behind your back! - That hurt! - Shut up. Hands behind your back. - This is a practice. - Hands behind your back! - Are you nuts... Ow! - Stay down. Shut up, asshole! There, that's how it's done. She was holding the zip-tie and she kept the gun on Mourad, all right? - You want to try the truck again? - No, no, it's all good. Oh, just one thing, guys! Don't forget that the second driver won't be in on this. Okay? And the same thing goes for the gas station staff at Lionville, okay? So, I want us to be believable because they'll eventually be witnesses. It's planned for Friday night. The Total gas station at Lionville. - Well done. - I think your stock must be close by. Very good. Uh... Thanks, Jacques-Yves. Good night. Same to you. Sephora Rivoli. Sephora Rivoli. - Coffee? - Okay. Okay, it's Mourad! Come on, let's go! But... That's it. They left. Let go of that! Let go! Let go, damn it! No, no, no! I swear, I didn't do anything! - Don't move. Get on the ground. - I didn't do anything, I swear! Get... Come on. Get out now. - Move! - Get out! Get out! Get out! Shut up! Give me your hands. Give me your hands! No, no, no! Don't shoot! I have kids, please. Don't move, stay down. Shut your mouth! The door! Come on! Come on! Go, go! Let's go, let's go, let's go! Where's Ange? I thought he was with you. Okay, forget it. Let's go! Let's go! Step on the gas! - Have you located my stock? - I'm nearly there. - Where are you? - In a big truck. Thing is though, my price has changed. I'm taking too many risks here. No more money without proof. Hey, another three and we're good. - Are we on schedule? - Yeah, but we shouldn't hang about. It's a bummer that we have to leave behind two brand-new trucks like this. - You need to find a woman, bro. - I don't see the connection. - Fuck. - What's wrong? I'm trying to call Boss. It's not going through. Forget it, they must already be heading out. They'll call us from the road. UNDELIVERED Damn it! Where is that son of a bitch? Motherfucker, he crawled through the hedgehog trap there, look. - Asshole! - Fuck! Look! Shit. How about that? The son of a bitch asked Breuil for 200,000 euros to hand us in. Monday at 7:45 a.m., hair combed to the right, DK glasses and Hermès tie, Nougarolis and his auditors arrived. Okay, shall we go? Étienne. Summary. In line with protocols set forth by KP2M, we therefore cross-checked the data on the company software and the physical stock inventory. This was carried out by taking samples from 320 boxes. Okay, okay. What was the result? We get... Unlike Nougarolis, I was born in Chartres. And unlike him, I learned this at birth. So, in conclusion the inventory confirms the quantities declared by the seller, uh, at the signing of the preliminary agreement. - Nothing missing? - It's marginal, sir. The Breuils always win. Brice. You'd like to know how little Patrick saved his skin, right? Remember that night? - Hello? - Sauveur. We need to meet. The cathedral. Now. TO ARMAND BREUIL FROM THE GRATEFUL TOWN OF CHARTRES You know we were in school together? - At Jean Moulin. - Doesn't ring a bell. I remember you very well though. So why'd you call? I bought some information off of one of your team. I have your names. Pictures of your safe house. With hundreds of thousands of euros in cash. which you're going to give back to me. Why didn't you call the police? I'm selling. When? We already signed, that's the problem. There's way too much perfume missing for the audit to go the way it needs to. So, I want all the products that you've stolen to end up back in my warehouse. Immediately. Well, that's a little tricky, seeing as I sold it all. Hm. I'd have preferred it didn't come to this. And here's little Patrick's plan B. To avoid everyone going to prison, I had to fill two trucks with an amount equal to the missing stock, I stole them, as you know. The insurance covered the loss, to then replace the boxes stolen from the warehouse. The auditors wouldn't notice shit. And Nougarolis, who thought he was going to pay Breuil half, would then have to pay full price. It's that, or the police. Except that in this story, we did all the work and made fuck all. As usual. And that doesn't work for me anymore. Let's follow my plan instead. Enjoy the show. Wait, your story is a little vague. I'll do the robbery. But you gotta tell me everything. Don't hold anything back. My wife. She's the one who talked me into selling. Into selling to Nougarolis. They're... close. Okay. So you want to hurt him a bit? Okay. I'll do your robbery, but anything I steal is mine. I don't think you don't get it, Sauveur. All of my products will return to me! Okay, calm down, buddy. Imagine... Imagine if, over time, people realized that the products prepared by Breuil for Colin Brown don't contain perfume anymore. What would happen? It would be a huge scandal. Breuil & Sons can't afford that kind of setback right now. It would be a lot more than a setback. All our clients would terminate their distribution contracts with us. It would finish us. Us? You mean, Nougarolis? What is this supposed to be? Water. Finish Nougarolis. So listen to me, Boss. We'll do the robbery, and then we make the real perfume disappear. And this is how it'll happen. On the morning of the robbery, I'll take care of offloading all the stolen goods into the commercial sector. They'll quickly run that through the black market, rest assured. Motherfucker, he did it. Meanwhile, you'll take care of getting the insurance in place. And you'd better play it smart because they have to believe you. For sure they're from the Paris suburbs. If they get into perfume we're in deep shit. Don't worry, Mr. Breuil, we have a solid file, it'll go through. Thank you, I'm relying on you. Thank you. And after that, we'll meet at Breuil to make our own recipe of gold. You have thousands of empty bottles just waiting to be filled with water on the production line. And I have the perfect team for implementing this ingenious plan. Without them it would be impossible to pack everything up into boxes and pallets in just one night. Let's go, guys. Go, go, go. We gotta keep moving. And once we've filled your stock with thousands of liters of water, I can tell you that we'll make things very difficult for Nougarolis. One last thing, before we settle this, you and me. You're going to help get the bastard that betrayed me. - Yes? - Yeah, I just got your message. Where is he? He said he was in the back of a truck on the way to your barn. That motherfucker. We're not there anymore. We gotta go back. Look at that son of a bitch. Go now. Oh, fuck! SAUVEUR, A NEWCOMER IN COSMETIC VALLEY Did you have that put there? It's not like I didn't owe him anything. Well, that's true. I wanted to say goodbye. - You're leaving? - Mm-hm. About time. What about you? I'll be staying put for quite a while. You must have seen the report on the water scandal in the world of luxury perfume. Well, now that Nougarolis is out of the picture... We'll quietly buy his business through Sauveur & Sons. I meet with Jacques-Yves next week to discuss distribution as well. And then I'll make my offer. And my proposition? What, to invest? I told you, keep it, I don't want your money. Spend it on yourself. Actually, there was something I promised not to tell you. The idea about the heist, the insurance... It wasn't my idea. Who? An angel's watching you, Daniel. And she's a blonde. So? How's that for panache?
