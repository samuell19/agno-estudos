- The wine makes your lips look even redder. Like cherries. Our coats please, thank you. We should go. - Yes, let's go. - You wanted me to take risks? I'll show you taking risks. Give me the money. Give me all your money. - With the weather. Rachel what's going on out there? - Thanks Dave, well... - Late again last night? - Just a few drinks after work. - You better dress warm, it's an ice rink outside. - Yeah well. - Good morning Mr. Sironi. - Good morning Mr. Sironi. - Good morning sir. - Turn that heater off. - It's keeping us warm sir. - Turn it off. - Open! - Good morning Mrs. Bianchini! Delighted to see you! We'll have you inside in no time! - Someone call the police and tell them it's a false alarm! Franklin, where the hell's Franklin? - He's gone to turn the power back on. - Tell him to turn the alarm off! And hurry the hell up! In a minute Mrs. Bianchini. Ah, voila! - The alarm goes off as if I was a criminal. Here, shove this through your security system. - Certainly. - That's one week alone. - Looks like you had a very successful week Mrs. Bianchini. Franklin here will have it counted in no time. - So, correct me if I'm wrong, your total is $143,500 euros. - Yes. They do well on vacation, we have every right haven't we Mr. Sironi? - Of course you do Mrs. Bianchini, of course you do. Lawrence and Katie would you go to the backroom and file what you have to file in the backroom. Make sure Mrs. Bianchini has everything that she desires. You're in very good hands Mrs. Bianchini, very good hands. - Detective Jonta sir, there's been a robbery at the B.E. Bank. - Have hostages been taken? - No, the robber was long gone. It happened half an hour ago. - Giustino, I've told you before, unless there's civil war going on out there, that door needs to be knocked on before coming in here. - Yes sir. - Yes sir my ass. That's the third time they've held up that bank. Now go and take the oldest car in the lot and wait for me with the engine running. - Okay. - It's days like this that I need to be reminded why I thought becoming a cop would be the best job in the world. My office is a dump, my area of responsibility is a dump. The future of my department, a dump. Honest people out there who think they can do wrong and get away with it, that's what made me want to be a cop. And today, this city is getting away with nothing. - Good morning detective. - Chief. - Clearly you heard about B.E. Bank. - That place is cursed. - I wouldn't be putting my savings in there. - I'm on the case, I'm heading over there now with Giustino. - Giustino? You're sure? - You have a better idea? - Dear Giulia, you're my world, my everything, and I cannot bear to imagine a life without you by my side. I did this for you. I assure you I'd do anything for your love. I'm waiting for you. - Yo man, I haven't seen you here in ages. What can I get you? - Drunk. - From my peripheral, I thought the customer had a big scarf around his neck. But I was too cold to move so I just figured I would find out when he got to the counter. The first time I got caught in a bank holdup I took a slap to the face. Robber didn't appreciate my arms up because the bank was made up of nothing but windows. The second time, I took a slap because I looked the robber in the face. - Put your head down! - What?! That is a hold up no no. This time, I knew exactly how to avoid getting slapped for a third time. - So you don't know what this guy looked like? I mean you have no idea whatsoever? So the criminal could be a man, or woman, or a gorilla at this stage, strolls in here and is casually handed, how much was it? - 140,000 euros sir. - 143,500. - And due to your surveillance system being down, the suspect looks like snow. - Katia told me to turn the alarm off because we were all going deaf in here, so I did. - Katia! Did I tell you to turn the alarm off? - Yes sir. I believe so sir. - Are you absolutely positive? - Well, I think so. - So you think so. - It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter who told who to turn the alarm off. Now let me see if I've got this story straight. There are six. Six cameras in this bank. But because the security system was turned off, none of them recorded anything that took place here. To cut a long story short, our criminal takes the money, walks out of the bank the same way he walks in without ever being noticed. Well can somebody explain to me in language that I can understand, what the hell just happened here today? - Details please. - I don't have any. - You serious? - Yup. - Well, thanks for coming home early for a change. Reminds me what I'm missing. - Hi this is Giulia, I'm not here for the moment but, just leave me a message and I'll call you back. - I can't really talk right now. The banks been robbed, I won't be in tonight. I'll call you tomorrow. - 143,500 euro. 143,500 euro. 143,500 euro! Bank account overdrawn. Mortgage overdue. Park and fine, penalty fine, overdraft. Let's do this. Oh keys, keys, keys, keys. - Are you gonna explain to me who you work for? - What? - Who do you work for? - Tony Di Lorenzo. - Tony Di Lorenzo? Never heard of him. - He's the owner of the company. - What company? - The Lorenzo Transport, I used to work in accounting. - You work in accounting? They give you this in accounting? - Are you police? - No I'm not the police. - Are you arresting me? - No I'm not arresting you. - I robbed a bank. - You robbed a bank with this? - The money's on the table, just take it, just take it, take it all. Please. So are you gonna arrest me or what? - Did I give you brain damage or do you always ask the same questions? - I don't know, maybe both. This broccoli is stinging my eye. - Did I give you brain damage or do you always ask the same question? - You just asked me that. - Yeah, I know, annoying isn't it? Gaetano Lolli. I'm your new neighbor. - I don't know what apartment you came from but normally when someone new moves into the building we bake them a cake not punch them in the... - Where the building came from, if you're holding a gun they jump you. I hope you feel better. And I'd be careful flashing these bills around money bags. - Do you care to tell me what's so funny? Nothing's funny sir. - Nothing's funny, nothing at all. Then why do you have a funny look on your face?! - I'm not sure, I... - It's there all the time! Do you find that we're all funny? - I don't know. My mother always said that I was a happy baby. - Come in! - I brought you your coffee sir. - What, were you grinding the beans with your hands? I asked for it an hour ago! Throw it in the plants! I don't wanna coffee, I don't need a coffee! Why am I surrounded by such incompetence?! If it's not funny boy Franklin, it's Katia the constant interference. Don't even get me started with that shivering wreck at the counter! If Mr. Fortis knew the habit... - I was just wondering if I could deal with this. - I'll go see if he's available. - Yes! - Mr. Sironi. There's someone here who needs to see you. - I agree it's cold outside but is that really necessary? You owe us a large sum of money. Did you lose your job? - Sorta. I quit. - What the hell did you do to your eye? - I didn't do it, someone else did. - Let me just pull up your file. Levati, Ruggero. Well you were employed in admin, says your wife works in hospitality. - My wife left me. - Well I'm very sorry to hear about that. I don't want to delve into your private life. I'm sure you both had your motives. However, that's no excuse for not making your loan payments. - She wanted to start a business but I ran out of money so she took all that was left and somehow managed to open a spa for men. - Rugerro Levati and Giulia Redondini. - I mean let's be honest, who wouldn't wanna be massaged by a beautiful young woman rather than an old man. I know I would. - You owe a heck a lot of money on your loan. 5,410 euros to be exact. I'm going to need that back tomorrow Mr. Levati. Otherwise I'm afraid... - Is that enough? - You may want to get yourself out of the red in your current account... - How much in the red am I? - 3,813 euros. - Just take the lot. That ought to cover it. - Always a pleasant surprise Mr. Levati. An inheritance? - No. Let's just say I robbed a bank. What are you doing here? - Keeping warm. How's your eye? - Not bad. How did you get in? - I let myself in. Why are you bringing this garbage in the house? - It's not garbage, it's my lunch. - Disgusting. - That's my lunch, what the hell... - My Nona passed this recipe down to me. I perfected it while I was in jail. You learn to make something out of nothing there. - So what are you, a good guy or a bad guy? - I was an accountant for some scumbags. - A loan shark or the mafia? - Ex loan shark. Until my associates turned me in and I went to jail. - But you got out of jail so, it means you didn't do anything too bad right? - Well, I did a deal with the police on the inside. So there's a lot of people on the outside who wanna see me dead. - Don't they normally send people like you to another country? - Yeah. But I got some saving from my accounting days and I need to collect before I leave. It's in the bank. - Which you can't get to because you could get killed. - Right. - You're late. I get it. Your bank was robbed then we needed to move dinner to tonight, I appreciate that. But now it's on the table, cold again! - You know how yesterday sucked? Well so did today. - Well I'm sorry to hear that. The salon was a mess today. - Your ex-husband paid me a visit today. - Ruggero? - Do you have any other husbands that I don't know about? - What did he want? - He deposited 10 grand into his account. I can't work out if he's screwing with me or if he really doesn't know about us. - Of course he doesn't know about us. And even if he did, he wouldn't go telling your wife if that's what you're worried about. - No, what I'm worried about Giulia is the cash. Where did he get it from? - How the hell am I supposed to know? I left him the day we got together. Remember? Well I let go of my world, but you still go home to yours every night! - Listen. Yesterday my bank was robbed. It was the perfect crime, perfect timing, no clues. Then your ex-husband pays me a visit the next day with 10,000 euros in his pocket. And when I asked him where he got it he says he robbed a bank. - Trust me, Ruggero isn't capable of robbing a bank! - The robbery happened right after Mrs. Bianchini left. You remember Mrs. Bianchini don't you? - The one you call a rich bitch with the panel beating company. - Yes. The one that arrives every Monday morning at 10 o'clock on the dot. - Do you think I told Ruggero? I don't even speak to him! - Whoever robbed my bank did their homework really really well. And it's pointless you stringing me along Giulia. I know people, and if someone's messing with me I will use them. Giulia I'm sorry... - Get out! - Giulia please, - Get out! - I'm sorry. - Get out or I'll call the police! - I know my way out. But I will get to the bottom of this! - So our favorite banker has a mistress. - Giulia Redondini sir. Apparently she's a head turner. Long legs, athletic. - I didn't think you'd come up with something useful. - Thank my wife sir. - Your wife? - Yeah, we live in the same building where Giulia Redondini used to live and where her loser husband is still holed up. - Is that so? - Yeah, one day my wife caught me staring at her butt when she was walking down stairs and what a butt sir. Anyway, my wife was like, you can look all you want because that's the most you'll get from a woman like that. This morning I remember her saying that she heard them fighting. So I called and asked if she knew the guys name. She did. Elio Sironi. - Now go home, it's late. - Yes sir! - Hey, good job. - Thank you sir. - Thank your wife! Elio Sironi. - Hello. - Hello? - Giulia? - I'm sorry, did I wake you up? - No, no, no, no, I mean, yeah, you know I don't really sleep that much. - So how are you? - I'm fine, I guess. I miss you. - Please Ruggero don't start, I didn't call for that, please. - Okay fine, I don't miss you and I'm fine. - I just called to see what you were up to. I know it's early but I knew otherwise I'd have to wait until tonight to call because you know we're both working and... - Yeah well, I'm not working anymore. - You're not working? - I quit. - When? - When you left. My head just wasn't in it anymore. I kept messing up the figures and, yeah I quit. Now I just stay at home and think about us. - Ruggero you really have to pull yourself together now. It's been nearly six months. - I know. - Living like this can't be healthy. So how do you even pay bills? How do you buy groceries? - You really wanna know? - Yeah of course I do. I'm worried about you. - Then why don't we meet up? Giulia, you there? - Where do you want to meet? - Here. At our home. - No Ruggero not there. I don't wanna bump into that slob on the second floor with her pervert police husband gawking all over me. - Okay, okay, okay fine, your house, wherever. - Okay. At my place. On Sunday okay? - Today would be better. - No, but today's Wednesday. Wednesday's a working day remember? Remember how that felt like? - Okay. - On Sunday, 8 am okay? We can have a coffee together. - Sounds delicious. - See you then. - Yeah. See ya then. - So here's the deal. A middle-aged banker suffering a midlife crisis falls for a girl half his age. Thanks Tina, tell the girls to be ready in five. - Okay. - The girl needs cash for whatever reason and the banker's so head over heels for her he finds a way to make it happen. Somehow he gets in touch with a crook. Gives him all the information he needs to rob his own branch. Makes sure the surveillance equipment isn't working when the crime takes place. The crook gets a cut, in his mistresses eyes, he's a hero. It's a win-win-win. It all makes sense. Now I just have to prove it. Tanner, Tessa, let's go! - Things are looking more positive out there. Here's the latest weather. Well it's still snowing but it has eased. Okay girls, see you later. The thing with Sironi is that he is respected in the community. A Lions Club member, on the board of his local church and of my own daughters school. But what do ya know, he cheats on his wife and robs his own bank. If I mess this one up, it'll leave a permanent stain. - Hello Mr. Fortis, what can I do for you sir? - Mr. Fortis what a pleasant surprise. Take a seat. - Your third robbery in six months. What the hell is going on? - Your guess is as good as mine. - Well yes. Let me guess. This will be fun. The surveillance camera didn't work. The alarm system was turned off. I guess that robber is one lucky son of a bitch. - Let me save you the Inspector Clueso act and spell it out for you. All eyes are on me. - Come on Sironi. With the amount of money you make you'd be an idiot to consider robbing your own branch. - Agreed. - I want your resignation. - On what basis? Because my branch was robbed? - Robbed three times. Three inexplicable times. Not to mention between the 10th and 20th of February you were in Sardaigne with a girl who is not your wife. - So you want me to resign because of adultery? What is this, the Vatican? - No, I would ask you to resign if I learned I went to an exclusive resort in Sardaigne priced at at least 10,000 euros a head. But looking at your accounts, not a cent came out of it. - Well you have no right to delve into my account! - Yes you're right, I don't. But I did. And so my question to you is, what side project are you working on to pay for your side project? - It's an inheritance. - If you inherited that money, I'll walk out of here with my head up my ass but I doubt you did. Sit down! So here's my ultimatum to you. Either you resign or I'll put together all these little pieces and present them to the police. - Okay, thinking about this rationally, if I resign, what happens? - Who knows. The police will carry on with their investigation without my help. If you're guilty they'll jail you. But, for robbery not extortion. That will be our little secret. - A secret that can't be proven. - Perhaps. - How long do I have to make up my mind? - Until Monday. - Did I come at a bad time? - At least you knocked this time. - How you feeling? - Higher... - Oh, that good hey? Yeah, no feel the same way myself. When are they turning the heating back on? - He said sometimes next week. - Let's hope so. Ooh, she's a stunner. I can see why she ended it. Let me guess, first girlfriend right? - Yeah. - Yeah she'd been with a few before you, probably went with a few during you as well right? - She had this little red dress. Whenever she put it on I knew she was on the prowl. - Mmm, serial adulterer. That's bad news. But, you took her back every time right? - She's my life. Still is. - Let me guess again, she followed you out here because she thought she'd hit the lottery. But when things went sour, she put the red dress back on again. - You're good. - Look. I get that you robbed a bank because you were desperate for cash but, I don't know, it just feels like to me that, you sorta wanted to get caught didn't ya? - I had a speech prepared for 24 News. I wanted her to know how much I loved her. How much she'd hurt me. And if I didn't get caught, I'd end up with a bunch of money. It was a kind of a win-win. - Yeah, especially if you were in prison. That's a great holiday. Look mate, the reason I'm 55 years old and I've never been shot is because I know how to read people. It's a gift. I know when to ask questions and I know when to shut up. - I can see that. - Is that so? So how did you get into accounting? - Actually, I studied marine biology in Italy and came out here as a researcher. - I would never have picked you for an academic. - Ahh, I hate payroll and bookkeeping but, well when I left my research position it was all I could find. - Nah. Would you ever go back? I mean all that cash and that horseshoe up your ass ain't gonna last forever. What would you say if I told you that I had a very well paying job for you? - Okay, okay, okay. - Next please. - Hello sir, what can I do for you today? - I would like to open my safe today. - Thank you. - Sir. - Thank you, follow me please. - Hello. What can I do for you today? - I'm looking for a haircut. - I'm sorry sir, we don't take hairstyle walk-ins on a Wednesday. - I'm embarrassed but what about a back waxing? - That's possible. Just follow me please. - Thank you. - May I come in? - Yes of course. You work here don't you? - Well actually I do more than work here. I own this place. - That's terrific, then I'm in good hands. - I usually leave the dirty work to my employees. But today, I'll just torture you myself. - That's hot. - And it will get worse so prepare. - So tell me, how does a young person like you come to own a place like this? I mean you must have had to take out quite a loan. Or was it an inheritance or a rich husband? - Well I'm married, but my husband is definitely not rich, not at all. Is your wife rich? - I found my wife digging through garbage bins in the street. - So you're a romantic. - Travesty of marrying for love. I think that's enough. I'm sure it looks great. - Are you sure? Because there's still just a spot above... - I'll get it later with a razor, thank you. - Okay. - With all this business to run you can't have any time to yourself. - And why do you ask so many questions? Are you spy with one of my competitors? - Close. I'm a detective. Like a spy without the travel. Spies travel the world looking for clues to solve their mysteries. But we detectives know the best clues are right in front of our eyes. The most interesting stuff is when normal people get involved with abnormal activities. - Woo, what a rush! There was no one around as far as I could tell. Nice fanny bag by the way. - Pochete amigo. Oh South America here I come. Take a look at what I've been doing for you today. - Oh yeah. - Feast your eyes on that. Eggplant parmigiana lasagne and I even made you some handmade penne. - Oh my God! Can I take it out? - Yes, go right ahead. I'll get the other one. This my friend is a work of art. Look at this. - You know, I can get used to this gangster lifestyle. - Is that so? - Yeah, I mean all this undercover smuggling, the punches to the face, meals. Man you guys eat amazing meals! All it needs is some ketchup. - What'd you say? - I'm sorry. - I'm not sure you even deserve this. - This, this is amazing. - So you're not brain dead then. - My god, thank you man. Thanks for all this. I mean if there's anything else I can do for you just, you know, get my hands dirty, whatever. - What about three more safes? - Sure. Like when do you want me to start? - After you eat. The address is on the bottom. And if you really wanna get your hands dirty, why don't you try vacuuming under your bed once in a while, it's disgusting. - Valentino, a double espresso. - Yeah just one second. - Now, hurry up it's Casoria. - Your double espresso sir. I'll come back with your change. - I don't need change. - Yes sir, thank you sir. Mr. Sironi. - Mr. Casoria, long time no talk. Have I caught you at a bad time? - Naw, you never catch me at a bad time. What can I do for you? - Well I was just wondering if perhaps we could meet for dinner this evening. I have some affairs I'd like to discuss with you. - Alright, how does 9 o'clock sound at Zia Teresa's? - Yeah that sounds grand, grand. Haven't a good meal in a long while. - Don't tell your wife that, she'll kill ya. - That's the least of my worries. - Alright, we'll see you at nine. - This is amazing. - You know when I collect all my cash I'm gonna open a restaurant in Brazil. I can't believe I'm saying this but, you're welcome to join. - Awe, I appreciate the offer but, I'm not the one in hiding. - What cave do you live in?! You know robbing a bank is a major offense. So if I were you, I'd be hiding that thing. Look, listen to me. There's beginners luck and then there horseshoe up your ass luck, and there's whatever magical land you live in. But you don't think there were surveillance cameras that got a shot of your face? - If they haven't noticed me by now that's gotta be a good thing right? I mean I robbed my own bank. - Sorry. - Yeah I robbed my own bank where I have my mortgage, my account, everything. - No you didn't. - Yeah I did. - Your own bank? - And then I went back the next day and deposited 10 grand. - But no one said anything? - Well the bank manager asked me where I got the money. - And you said? - I told him I robbed a bank. - You're messing with me. - No I'm not. - You are messing with me. Well it's possible that the surveillance cameras were down that day. I mean anything is possible with you. Somebody must have recognized you. - The employee there didn't even look up at me. - What about when you ran out? - I didn't run out, I walked. - Oh? That's unbelievable. - Mr. Casoria, what brings you here today? - Anto, what the hell kind of question is that? What do you think I come here for, your face? - Of course not, we'll get your table ready. The one with your name on it. - I'm waiting for someone. - Oh, table for two then. Come have a seat. - Mr. Casoria. - Sironi, good to see you. How are things? - Well they could be better. - Before we have a seat, there's something that could cheer you up. A little business capital from the newstand venture. It's turning into a real goldmine that one. - I appreciate that. - Hey, you a fan of fish? - Yes, yes I am. - Then you're in for a treat. They serve the best fish in town. - Mr. Casoria is a fish connoisseur. But if you will, allow me to take care of your needs today. - Sounds good. But just no scorpion fish. I don't wanna lose my life over dinner. - No. - Fucking idiot. What's the matter Mr. Sironi, you're not hungry? You know that's a sign you're in love. - Yeah, well things aren't going very well at the moment. - You're telling me. The first two robberies we did at your dump of a bank were a piece of cake. This time we got beat to the punch. - I was just wondering, if a man in your line of work, of your stature, might be able to shed some light on who the criminal might be? - What am I a detective? - No, I just think it would be a really good idea to find out who the culprit is. - Now are you a detective? - Mr. Casoria, there is no trace of the robber or of the 150 grand he took off with. I am just worried that if the police start asking too many questions, rather than find out who the robber is, they might pick up something about us. - You and I Mr. Sironi are nothing more than acquaintances. In fact, we don't even call each other by our first names. So you tell me Mr. Sironi, how the hell is someone gonna find something out about you and me? - All I know if the police ask me questions, I don't know how things will end up. - Well that makes the both of us. - Sante... - Elio. - Consider this a personal favor. A favor I'm willing to pay for. Take this as a down payment. - Down payment for what? Listen, I'd try to find this guy, but really it could've been anyone that robbed your bank. - What if I had a lead? - Continue. - Well there's this woman, an ex fling of mine. She might have tipped off when and how to do it. She'd know. - Alright. I'll need her name and address. And I'll have my men take care of the rest. - Please don't hurt her. - Hey, now why would we wanna hurt an innocent woman? Your girl will be fine. Now. Name and address please. - Giulia it's Elio. Listen, I won't be angry if you set this whole thing up. Just give me a ring. Tell me what really happened and it'll be okay. Okay? Okay. Giulia, call me as soon as you can, it's urgent. Thanks. I swear if you don't come out with it I'll get the truth myself. Do you hear me?! Giulia, Giulia. I love you. Giulia I love you. - You can take your money! And your gifts! And leave me alone! Oh Mrs. Landoni I'm sorry. - You're sorry? It sounds like a bar fight in there. Is everything alright? - Yes everything's fine. I just had a long day. - Well, you know if you need anything you know who to call. - Thank you Mrs. Landoni, goodnight. - Goodnight. - Everything okay? - Everything's fine. I just have to make a call. Station. Hey John. - Hi. - Good morning Susan. - Good morning. Chief's in your office already. - How are you doing detective? - I'm fine. - Fine enough to be making an urgent call to the water operations unit to scour the river for any suspicious objects and the sketch team. You've been a stallion for the police force. - With all due respect sir, are you firing me? - Of course not, I just think maybe you should take a couple of weeks off. - I don't need a holiday. - Sorry to interrupt sir. - Giustino. - Hello sir. The boys found quite a few things down there sir. Even a toy gun, nothing suspicious. - Any leads on witnesses? - None yet, but we are definitely asking around. It was a busy night, someone's bound to pop up. - Good job Giustino, now get some rest, you've had a long night. - Yes sir. - You should take your own advice. It'll do you good. - What do you want from me? Do you want my purse? Do you want money, what do you want?! - You know why I'm here. And it ain't for your money. Let's go back to your place for a little chat. - Giulia! Giulia! What happened? - Ahh, celebrate good times. - These bank visits are exhausting. - Compare a bank to a bad woman. Now they're exhausting. - You ever had one? - What? - A broad I mean. - Yeah a girlfriend I've had 'em. Look I was a gangster. Women love that kind of thing. But I'll tell you what. None of thems worth it. - Oh my, you gotta be kidding me. White and milk chocolate in one cornetto? - Oh yes. - Swirled? This is like a cure for racism! - You know, I never thought I'd say this, but you're smarter than you think. I call that le pardo. - I call it freaking awesome! - Well you know half the race in Brazil is mix. So that's gonna be my highest selling cornetti. - Well not if I eat them all first. - Well you can't eat them all. - Why not?! - You know what? You're not coming to Brazil. - Just give me a couple of hours, I'll be fine. - Something wrong with you. - Well? - I'm really sorry Zio. - No, no, I'm sorry. And you know why? Because I let a girl go out there and do a mans job. - You said she left her place every morning at 8:15. She was early. - Max, quit being a girl and grow some balls. - Here, go get yourself some breakfast. I'll deal with her myself. - I'm sorry Zio. - Go on. Another fucking idiot. - You have to go see a doctor dear. - Yeah, if it wasn't for me and little Sparky barking who knows what would have happened. - You just lie back there now. That's a girl. - Mrs. Landoni I really, I shouldn't. - Now should we call your father? - My father? He's been dead for years. - I thought I saw him at your house a couple of days ago? - What? - You see, you're not with it. That thug knocked your senses out. Aldo, call Dr. Anderson on the third floor. Tell him it's an emergency. - Mrs. Landoni, I really appreciate your concern but I have a business to run. I'll just go and work it off. - Work it off?! Over my dead body you will. And I have no intention of dying any time soon. - I'm sorry. - Thank you kindly. - You looking for someone? - Yes ma'am. Sorry to bother you. I was just wondering if you knew where the occupant of that apartment was. - The occupant of that apartment left this morning on holidays. She left me in charge of watering her plants. - Any idea when she'll be back? - In about a month. - A month? It's a nice holiday. - She had a rough morning and just booked it last minute. Can I pass on a message? - Yes you can. My message applies to you too ma'am. You ever think of life after death? - I'm sorry? - Do you believe in god ma'am? - Look, I'm not interested okay. - Did you bring the pecorino? There's nothing like full bellies and full wallets. - Have you been trying to seduce me? - Normally I'd kick somebody in the ass for saying something like that. But tonight I'm gonna let it slide. Because tonight my friend, we celebrate freedom. Not too loudly, don't wanna get killed. Here. - Cheers. - And you said you weren't tired. - Well those pills were terrific. Think I haven't slept like this in ages. - I know he's not your father. - Hello. - Mr. Sironi, wakey wakey. - Mr. Casoria is that you? - Surprise. Now listen, we have a little problem. The girls gone, she never showed up for work. Sounds like she might be away for a month. Can you wait that long? - A month, hell no. This has to be done by Monday. - Monday? Any idea where we could track her down? - No, no. Well... Well maybe at he ex-husbands place. - Her ex-husband?! You and I need to meet now! - It's Saturday morning. - Yeah, well when do we have to have this all cleared up by? - By Monday. - I'll meet you at the restaurant. - Hello? - Hello, is there any chance I could speak with Detective Jonta please? - May I ask who's calling? - Yes it's Giulia Redondini. The woman who waxed his back a few days ago. - Waxed his back? - Yes. - One moment. A woman who waxed your back is calling for you on a Saturday, in the morning. She waxed your back?! - Tina, what's wrong with you? That's my work phone. And I had my back waxed to get information. And it was very painful. Detective Jonta speaking. - Yes hello, it's Giulia, I waxed your back a few days ago. - Yes, I remember. - I'm really sorry to bother you out of the blue but, I wonder if we could meet today? I need to talk to you about something. - Well I'll be in the office this morning. - Well I don't think I can make it to your office because I've had a bit of an accident. - An accident?! - Yes, could you come and visit me at my place? - Yes. - That would be great. - I'll see you then. - Thank you. - Tina, what is your problem? - Well, it's just that you're never here. When you are it's as if you don't even want to be. - Tina, you know what, Tina, I've been doing this for years. You know what it's like and right now I'm in the middle of a really complex case, that's all. - I want to be your complex case. - Well you are. What I mean is, you're my most important case. - They're just words. - Look, I'll go to the office and see if I can't get a half day. Something like that. Would you like that? - Yeah. - Good. Go on. Read it. - "Got a witness, just finishing with the sketch artist now. "Giustino." You're cheating on me with Giustino. - So how is it? - Well, I'm certainly gonna miss your breakfasts. Tomorrow especially. - Tomorrow, you got plans? Here. - I sure do. - Let me guess, you're gonna go see that woman of yours? - How do you know that? - Oh I don't know. Maybe watching you look at yourself in the mirror in those dishrags you call clothes for an hour. Maybe it was you ironing your socks. - You got any advice you can give me? - No. - What, none? - None. If you was a normal person I would say stay the hell away from her, she's bad news. But you're not normal. You rob banks without a plan and you get away with it. I mean if the earth was to flood tomorrow you wouldn't even get wet. So no, I've got no advice for you. What are you trying to do?! Scrub a hole through it? - No, just... - First of all, they always work a lot better if you use one of these. Plug it in. Get out me way. - Good morning guys! - Good morning detective. - Having a busy Saturday Giustino? - Yes sir. - Where's the artwork I asked for, I need it fast. I have two appointments in a half day. - There it is sir. They even did it in color for you. - Color aye, and it was night. - The witness didn't have much to say about the guy except that he looked pretty glum. He looks sketchy doesn't he? Sketchy, it's a sketch. You get it sir? Okay okay, I'll shut up. - The coast is clear. - Okay dear, you take care of yourself huh? And tell that detective friend of yours everything that happened. - Yes I will. Thank you. - And remember... - Yes, lunch is at 12 o'clock sharp. Thank you. - So do me a favor and hang these up because I ain't doing them again. Wait. You know I do have some advice for you. Something my grandfather told me a long time ago. Act as a sheep and a wolf will eat you. - What does that mean? - I'll tell you but you have to answer a question. - Okay. - Why'd you leave your job? - I already told you, I needed the money and I couldn't be a researcher all my life. - So who needed the money more? You or her? - I thought you said one question? - Two part. - Well I guess she did. - Thank you. - But she wasn't all wrong. I mean, what if we were to have kids? Kids are expensive. - Yeah but you didn't have kids did ya? - We decided to leave it for a bit. - Three part. Who decided to wait? You or her? - We both did. Maybe she did more than me. - Act as a sheep and the wolf will eat you. - You're a man of little sleep. - It's all about quality not quantity. It doesn't look like you're getting much either. - Can I get you something sir? - No I'm fine thanks. - Sit. So. You've been screwing around with a married woman. Classy. - First of all she's no longer married. Second, she never ever puts out, and with all due respect I don't think you're a man that can be giving lessons on integrity. - Nah ah ah, not so fast bank man. The one cheating on his wife is you. - And the criminal is you. - Business man, and you're a partner in crime. If I remember correctly, it was you who opened up your bank doors so we can get some much needed funds. So, seeing that you're running out of time, let's get the story straight. Your girl has a husband. - An ex-husband. - Whatever. She tells him about the security system in the bank. When the cash arrives he robs the bank. - Yeah I think so. - You think so?! - Well I'm not 100% sure but, I just can't see it any other way. - Then it could have been anybody. - Yes. What I need you to do is go and visit the ex and persuade him to turn himself in. - For what? - For robbing my bank. - You just told me you weren't 100% sure. - Does it matter?! I mean does it matter if I'm spot on or not? That's what you're here for. To turn the uncertainties into certainties. - I'm not gonna do it. - You're not gonna do it? Why not? - What you want me to just knock on every persons door who might have robbed your bank in the city? I don't work on guesstimates. - Well if you don't do it, if you don't it then I... I can take you to the cops. - Excuse me? - You heard me. I can tell the cops who you are and what you're about. - Is that so? - Yes, because I know who robbed my bank. I mean I think I know, but it's more than I think. And I think it's time people stop messing me around and started treating me with some respect. I put food on the tables of a lot of families. Yours included. I deserve a lot of credit. I mean think about it. If he robbed my bank, then he's got a lot of money on him. Go and get him. Then, I'll take you to a proper fish restaurant. - Thank you. - My pleasure. - So why did you call? I can see you're going somewhere special today. - Oh no it was just you know, with all this bruising I just wanted to wear something that made me feel feminine. I know it's crazy. - Fair enough. So, what happened? - Well I was going down the stairs heading to the spa and this guy attacked me. He didn't want my money but he wanted to talk to me about something. Luckily the Landoni's across were out spying as usual. And they must have scared him away when he saw them. - Has anything gone on recently which might have led him to this incident? - No, not really. - Oh, I'm gonna ask you some questions so I can better understand this entire situation. - Okay. - Do you mind? - No, no, not at all. - So what do you know about Elio Sironi? - Elio and I, we are, I guess we are together. - How long have you been together? - Ever since I started having trouble with my husband. - And is this spa business yours or his Mrs. Redondini? - Mine. - Did he pay towards the purchase of the business? - Yes. - How much did he invest? - Everything. He bought it for me. - Wow, that's a big diamond ring. And did he give you any indication where he got the money to make that investment Mrs. Redondini? - No, but, he's a banker so I just always thought he made lots of money. - And do you own this apartment? - Elio bought it. And he said we would live here together. - But you don't. - No. He's still with his wife. - And you're aware that his bank was robbed this week? - Yes and he thinks I tipped my ex-husband to do it. - Why your ex-husband? - Because my ex-husband came into the bank the next day to pay his overdue payments or whatever. But seriously, the guy wouldn't go fishing because he thought bait was cruel. He wouldn't hold up a gun and much less a bank. - Thank you Mrs. Redondini. - Thank you. - I assure you we'll get to the bottom of this. In the meantime, if you see anything suspicious, call us immediately. - Okay. Can I ask you a question? - Of course. - Am I safe? - Cooperate with me Mrs. Redondini and I promise you'll be safe. - Thank you. I really appreciate that. - Just out of curiosity, might you have any idea who this could be? - Well that looks a lot like my ex-husband Ruggero. - Thank you. You have been very helpful. - Hello. - Mr. Sironi, Sante Casoria here. - Yes, well. - Yes well indeed. I've thought about our meeting and I think I will take you up on the offer after all. - You made the right decision Mr. Casoria. - Oh I don't doubt that. How 'bout we meet at 3 am at the city park and ride? - 3 am? That's ridiculous. - If you wanna be sure to find the guy at home there's no better time than 3 am. - What the hell am I gonna tell my wife? - Isn't lying to your wife your strong point? Tell her whatever the hell you want. Fucking idiot. - Right, ready to go? - I'm always ready. But before we head out, could you just explain to me one more time why we're heading to this guys house? - Are you serious? Mr. Casoria please pay close attention. Tonight, we are going to visit Ruggero Lavati. The ex-husband of my ex side project. Huh? Because I am almost 100% sure that he's the man that robbed my bank. We are simply going to get him to turn himself in. And in a gentle manner that only you can provide. - So we're going to convince him to turn himself in? - Yeah we're going to convince him to turn himself in. That way no one can claim that I'm the one responsible so I won't be forced to tell the police a few things that you're more than aware of. - Sounds good. Alright, get in the car. - You wanna take mine? - You don't wanna leave a car like this in a place like this do you? - Good point. Speaking of which, why did you wanna meet me here anyway? What's wrong now? - Just one more thing. How did you get out of it with your wife? - I came up with a really good excuse. I said the alarm on my mobile to ring pretending it was the police calling to say that the alarm at the bank was going off. And I told her I had to go in and disarm it. - Perfect. Fucking idiot. - Casoria. I hate goodbyes, they always made me cry. So instead, I thought I'd leave you this note and the money I promised you for a job well done. It'd be great to meet up again. My offer always stands. So all the best to you and good luck. Not like you need more of that. - Yeah. - Salina, Gaetano Lolli here. - Gaetano? Something wrong? - For you maybe. Had an old friend come to pay me a visit. Does the name Sante Casoria ring a bell? - Where did you see him? - At my place. - What the hell is going on here? - You tell me. This is an inside job on your end. - There's no need to make false accusations. Just let me know where you are and we'll come get you. - Maybe you should go pick Casoria up. You don't need my testimony against him anymore. - Did you kill him? - No I didn't kill him. He committed suicide down my stairwell. - Alright, tell us where you are and we'll clear this mess up. - We will clear this mess up the next time we meet. - Lolli you tell me right this instant where. Lolli? Lolli? - Thanks. Dear wolf, I'm your sheep no more. Regards, Ruggero. P.S., I've known about you and the banker all along. - Yep. - Detective Jonta. - Hi detective. - Chief, thank you. - Why are you still working? You should be on vacation. - I know Chief but I just can't get my head around this case. - You've been on the force for how long now? - Going on 25 years. - Because you're a man of integrity and experience, I'll tell you something. But you can't spread this around. - Understood. - For the last two years we've been investigating a large underground crime ring. Extortion, drug dealing, robbing banks. Casoria. - The dead guy on the stairs? - The dead guy on the stairs was involved in this ring. And on Sunday morning he showed up at the building where one of our pry man, our protected informants was staying. Casoria got shot by our man. Was furious because he thinks there's a rat on our end. The more I think about it, the more I think he might be right. Casoria decides to eliminate anyone who could know about his activities. Starting with Sironi. - So he shoots Sironi because he had his hands in the mix, money laundering I suppose. And he sees him as the weakest link. - He would've ratted them out. I hope this makes things a little clearer. - So Chief, you really think Sironi asked the mob to rob his bank three times? - Yes. It's the only logical explanation. - What about Ruggero Levati? - Who's Ruggero Levati? - Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. We're about to start our descent into Rio de Janeiro. The temperature is a balmy 32 degrees or 89.6 degrees Fahrenheit. - You couldn't wait 30 minutes? - I'm sorry. - 30 minutes, that was a gift for our driver. - I know I'm sorry. I just, awe man they're so good. Well, how many hours we've been in the air now? - Too long. - I need some water. - Look at you. You're not gonna eat the biscuits dry. - No just rob us another bank if I do. - Sooner or later you're gonna run out of luck my friend. - Some call it luck some call it destiny. - I heard you coughing sir, do you need some water? - Thanks. - Some would call it a horseshoe up your ass. - Girls take your bags into the backseat, there's no room in the boot. - So they wanted a logical explanation to support their own flawed conclusions. But that doesn't put my own thoughts to rest. I guess there's no such thing as a perfect holiday.
