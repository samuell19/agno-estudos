It's been so hot this summer. It's forcing me to wear light clothes. I like airplanes, especially how they look from down here. The underneath of airplanes are so simple. WATERMELON How annoying. I always feel self-conscious whenever this happens. Oh, I'm sorry. NOT an accident. It's okay. - The manager sort of needs you. - What? I'm kind of in a hurry too. I hate the way he talks. I'll just wait here. What for? Go away. He's dropping five ranks. "Favorite Men Ranking" "25th - Shun Kamata" What are you doing? Morning. Manager's waiting. I know. What's he want? About your shifts, I think. I'm quitting. Quitting? Selfish as usual. I'm getting busy with the modeling job. Wow, good for you. She's bragging. Why don't you come see the event next week? "Come check out my great figure. " What kind of event? As if I care. I'm told it's a big bonsai fair. Bonsai? Ha ha. But actually, the outfit is really cute. That's good. Old men will love it. - Bye. - See you around. Stop taking peeks at my chest. This is a problem... My God, those tits are huge! Where was he ranked? He just dropped 10 ranks. Can't you come in this weekend? I can't this Sunday. Who works on their birthday? Not that I have any plans. You know, I'm short one person. Come on. Please! I'm up here, pervert. God, just look at them! He is so dead. Lately, I seem to hear peoples' thoughts. Just once, if I could grab those tits! How indecent those breasts are. She can't be very bright. Bend down... come on! Damn it! Over here! - More coffee? - Yes, please. Now I can live for another day... I've turned 22 after all. I've never made my own decisions. It's easier to let others make them for me. Then I'll be less responsible. But I long to be a woman who makes her own way, and laughs away any mistakes she makes. That's why, when I turned 20, I made myself a promise: I would marry the man at the top of my list when I became 22, kind of like a "planned impulse. " I have had sex with three men in my life. The First Man Wow, they're so soft! Wow! Just like marshmallows. Unbelievable! How's this? I'm coming! Are you coming? Give me a break! The Second Man The Third Man Are you sure? I wanted this so much. This is great. I knew it. It was always my boobs. I felt like my personality was neglected. I counted every squeeze and scored it against him. In one night, he dropped at least 100 ranks. I'm so sorry! Good evening. - I'd like to send this package, please. - Excuse me? It says you accept them. "We Accept Deliveries" Oh, I had forgotten. Just a moment. He must be the first person to use this delivery system. Please fill this in. Is it alive? Oh, no... It's a toy duckling. It chirps when you shake it. - You don't believe me? I'm not lying. - Okay. I found it on the beach. It had a telephone number on it, so I called and asked if they wanted it back. Oh, really? As if I care. Apparently they live upstream. Their child was looking all over for it, crying. So I wanted to send it to them right away. Please, did I ask? It sounds made up. But wait... This guy isn't staring at my boobs. I'm done. Okay. I don't hear what he's thinking, either. Wrong character... One Month Later This man didn't even touch my boobs. That was great. How great? It's going down in history. - Come on, you're exaggerating. - My history, I mean. - It was unforgettable. - Which part? I'd say your voice. My voice? It sounded like you were playing tennis. - No way! - How about you? It was kind of fresh. Fresh as in new? What else, dummy? You see, you're my fourth man. The other three were awful. All they cared about were my breasts. Oh, really? Tell me more about yourself. Like what? Your sex history. - That would be boring. - Come on, please. Let's see... Okay. I like public baths. There's a bath at home, but I still like to go sometimes. Can I help you? She and her husband had split up on their way to a hot spring, and all of the public baths were closed by then. Do you want to use my bath? Hey... Hold it. Keep your voice down! Do you have a place to stay? If it's just for one night... No, but thanks anyway. You helped me. That's it. That was the only time I saw a bath-sex mania. Did that really happen? Yes, it really happened. - Did she have really big breasts? - No... I don't think so. I didn't really have time to look. I'm not obsessed with boobs. Is there such a guy? - Really? - Yeah. Okay, now I'm confused... A always dreamed of a guy like this. But if boobs don't interest him, what does he like about me? You know what? I like you for who you are. How lame! But he's the first guy to say that to me. Well, the soundproofing seems to work! - We'll get used to it. - But this is continuous. I guess that's why the rent's cheap. Hey, don't you have any pornos? Threw 'em out, though I might have a couple left. - This? - Yeah. "My Favorites" I won't watch them anymore. It's just a keepsake. Really? Want to see it for the last time? Hey, stop playing around. Calm down, I'm just kidding. My husband keeps no secrets. But there is one thing... That tape is broken though. He tells silly lies. It is? A friend I lent it to said he couldn't see anything. - What's this? - It's a "Head-i-copter. " - No way! - Really. Dad gave it to me when he was dying. He said, "Here, a Head-i-copter. " - That's not funny. - That's what he said. - You could fly with this? - I guess. I never tried. I'm afraid of heights. Yeah, right. These little fibs he told... I decided were his odd way of entertaining me. Is this salad dressing? - You like this song? - You know it? - Yes. Him, right? You know the title? "The Gum You were Chewing" Yup, "The Gum-chew. " - "The Gum-chew"? What a weird title. I'm surprised you know him. He's not very famous, you know. He lives in Nerima now. I saw him at a drugstore. - Come on! - You know he has hemorrhoids? He was buying medication. He was like, moving funny - sort of bent over. Why are you lying? I'm sorry. Heeeeey! You really like this place. I can see them fly low here. Aren't you hot? This temperature is abnormal. - A huge earthquake is coming. - Why? Don't you know? The summer before the Hanshin-Awaji earthquake was scorching. Really? How come you're home so early today? - Because I quit. - What? - Want to know why? - Of course! Why did you quit? Remember the new boss I got assigned to? Well, you wouldn't believe him. He had connections with the mob. The mob? There he goes. From Hong Kong. According to him, the travel agency needs the mob. The agency's too small to survive on its own. And he tried to drag me into it. I couldn't do that. - I guess that would be too much. - Yup, absolutely. Couldn't you at least come up with a better excuse? This is all true. So now what? I actually hate planes. Never been on one. A travel agent who's never been on a plane. Can you believe it? Why haven't you been on one? I know it's been proven... but it's still hard to believe a mass of iron can fly. It seems like a big fib. Look who's talking! Why have they gotten bigger? Why does he have two phones? - Hello? - Excuse me, I believe that's my phone. - Yes, I found it. - Even from here, I can hear the woman's voice. - Shall I send it to you? - Let me call you back later. - Okay, no problem. - Thanks. - You're welcome. What was that about? I found this phone on the street. The owner just called. You should've taken it to the police. It's easier this way. Is that like your hobby? "Rescuing" lost items? Nicely put. I'm going back to work. Why? I'll start working again. No, I'm starting to gain weight, so I should. You don't look fat at all. I once had, like, 70kg on me. Like that's a great comfort! Let me ask you something: Do you ever worry about money? Sometimes. We aren't doing good. It's serious. It's dangerous? Does he really care? I'll work until you find a job. Okay. You worked here before? Yes. I got married and left, but I'd like to work again. I see. Oh, excuse me! My eyes got drawn - I apologise. It's okay. I'm glad to have someone experienced. You didn't even need to write a resume. - That's not right. - You follow the rules, eh? Can you start this week? Sure. Thank you very much. How much? One hamburger steak meal and two beers... 2,250 yen, please. Not the meal! I meant you! I meant your titties! How much is it for a grab? I'll call the police, jerk! I'm not asking for it to be free. Come on, just let me fiddle with them. Pleeeease! - One million yen. - Holy tits! Can't you bring it down to 100 yen? One million yen. What? One million yen... you can't have her otherwise. Are you trying to con me? I'm calling the cops. Camera's right there. She's not worth all that. 100 yen should be more than enough! The 2,250 yen for your meal? Thank you so much. Here. Don't worry about being harsh. They deserve it. Okay. What's up? - I have an interview. - What interview? For a job. - You were serious? - Yeah. - What kind of job? - It's a resourcing agency. - The working conditions sound great. - Really? Hello. Yes, that's me. - I'm just leaving. - I'll be waiting. - OK. Give me a call when you get near. Yes... Near the station? Hotel Koln Look what happens... the first decision I made, and it's turned to crap. What am I doing? Hi. Your shift is over, right? - Yes. - Let's go. What? Do you want to go straight home? Was it impulsive? - The change you took. - Shit! - You'll put it back. I'm very sorry. Don't worry about it. We all lose it sometimes. Where to? - Haneda. - The airport? There's a park near the airport that I like. Move up. So beautiful... These really are your sex appeal, Chika. You should be more daring. Dress sexy. Had a fight with your husband? My husband is a liar. - That's horrible. - No... He doesn't keep secrets from me. He tells lies, but doesn't keep any secrets? Doesn't make sense. Lies are used to keep secrets. But it's true with Hiroshi. I'm not a liar, but I do have secrets. Is that so? So you can't trust your husband? Hi, you're home. What's wrong? Something happened. Had a fight with your new girlfriend? And you? - Did you have the late shift? - Uh-huh. I lied to my husband for the first time. I went to that job interview... and it turned out to be a trap. Am I hearing this right? "A trap"? Remember the phone I found? She asked me what I did, so I told her I was unemployed. She offered to hook me up with a job interview, and told me to bring the phone then. This story sucks already. So I went... But she gave me an odd address to meet up at. At least that part's true. When I went in, some strange guy was there. He said I owed him rental fees for the phone. I refused and, "Bang!", he punched me and I passed out. Doesn't he ever know when to stop? When I came to, my wallet was gone. There was just a note: "Have one million yen ready by tomorrow. " In other words, you need money for this new girl. Then I came home and fell asleep. And here I am now. What? You expect me to believe that? But that's the truth. I can't take this anymore. I'm tired. Hiroshi Hello. Yes, it's Chika. Can you see me tonight? Come on, turn onto your stomach. What's that noise? Get off! What's wrong? What? What's this? Oops. Hey! What are you doing? Hey! Super-size. Chika Ninomiya This man is a serious pervert. This? I told you I had secrets. That's it. Breasts are everything on a woman. Don't get me wrong - it's not how big they are, they're all different. You can find all kinds of adult videos at the store. But they're never ordered by breast types. So I had to make them myself. I'll tell you, it wasn't easy. Relax: They're only for my private use. Think of it as a joke. No way. The only type I didn't have was your size. Otherwise, my collection was complete. You always look offended when people stare. But that's just a show you're putting on. That's not true. Are you sure? You're so self-conscious and full of pride. You hide it well, though. Who would guess? I bet you enjoy attending to those customers. My tapes! I never ran, because it made my breasts swing. Everyone's looking... Staring... Staring. Didn't I say I was afraid of heights? I want to know how many lies he's told. I slept with my boss... There, I confessed. Now, it's your turn. - Be honest. - But Chika... Make me understand. But I hardly ever lied to you. I'm begging you. We're pretty high up... - What about your boss and the mob? - All true. - And the phone? - It's true. - The "trap"? - It happened. - You used to weigh 70kg? - I was fat! - The singer with hemorrhoids? - He has hemorrhoids! - The bath-sex incident never happened. - Yes, it did! What is all this? You don't believe me? Okay, I'll tell you... There's one thing I lied about. I actually love big boobs! Of all the lies! I lied because I didn't want you to take it wrong. - The girl in the bath had big boobs. - You're lying. - No, I'm not. - Then why don't you ever touch mine? See, I privately rank each pair of breasts that I see, into groups A, B, C, and D. Then there's the special group, 'S'. This ranking isn't just about size. It's about the overall impression, the balance. So for me, group S breasts are so divine. I can barely look at them, much less touch them. That's the only thing I lied to you about. There's nothing else. But this is one thing that means a lot to you. That's why you can't believe me about everything else. I don't know what to believe anymore. For example... just as an example, but this tape, I might want it. Like, remember the tape, "My Favorites"? That's actually a Big Boob Special. Could you have come up with a worse example? "I'll be staying with my parents. "I'll come back if I decide I can trust you. "But I do believe you're afraid of heights. - Chika" Favourite Men - Top 100 #1- Hiroshi Ninomiya Subtitles by Lord Retsudo Cast: I wanted to buy you your favourite gum, but you refused.
