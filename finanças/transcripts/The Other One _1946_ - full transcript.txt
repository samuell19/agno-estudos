"Blessed are those who die in the bosom of the Lord" "Monterrey Iron & Steel" "Salinas & Rocha, Inc." "Mancilla y Rosas, Inc." -Poor Mrs. Montes de Oca -She's a brave woman A rich widow in the prime of life... She won't suffer long. It's almost worth envying. What an impertinent woman! To arrive as the burial's ending! -It's her sister, you know? She works. -Clearly. She didn't have the other's luck. Couldn't you find something better to wear? Is that her sister? With your husband, banking and commerce has lost an important man. I offer you my sincere condolences. Ms. Mendez, please so kind as to ride with us. Your sister would like it. Thank you, Mr. de la Fuente. -Despite it all, I envy her. -Her husband's death? Even that! Why not? Allow me, madam. Goodbye Ms. Mendez. Does madam want tea brought to her room? What awaits us with this woman's temper... I don't know how I'll survive these awful black rags! Widowhood should come with some disadvantages. Is that suppose to be a reproach? You never did try to understand my life. I understand it better than you think. It could do you no harm, seeing as I've known how to truly live it... Or rather, I've been able to truly enjoy it! True. In spite of everyone else... Even me. You always knew how to top me in everything. Steal the best from me. Our parents' affections... Their pampering, their praise... And finally, the man I could have married. There's one thing I'm sure of... I've felt his death much more than you. Where's this coming from? Anyone would say you're jealous. You could have as much as I do. But look at yourself... you'll get nowhere looking like that. I'll show you. I'll have to do without them while mourning. By then, they'll be out of fashion. Pick what you like. This one... or this one... or this other... No, not this one. I promised it to my chambermaid. Thanks. You've always been very generous with you table-scraps. As proud as always! With those silly scruples, you'll never be more than a poor manicurist. Why not be a little accommodating to the clientele? Do you know what that "accommodation" means? Do I know? As much as you ignore the value in making use of men. Only occasionally, and discreetly, of course. Take my advice, sister... Fate is always loaded with a great dose of irony. The smart things is knowing how to accept this dose. You haven't learned to face the world with the same weapons it uses. What weapons? For example... with cunning, with cynicism... ...with hypocrisy... With crime? Don't exaggerate! I'm speaking only of small weapons... not last resorts. Mrs. Magdalena, the tea is served. Why so quiet? No more reproaches left? I'm leaving. I'll accept the dose of irony that life has thrown at me. From now on, I'm going to live, or choose to quit, my own life. It's your business! You're not taking the clothes? I don't believe I need them. What's that? It's nothing. Goodbye Magdalena. I bet she won't last six months without remarrying! Sure. Who wouldn't want that $5 million inheritance? Is Miss not staying for tea. -Thank you, but it's far too late. -But Miss will get wet. It doesn't matter. Remove a glass and take the tea to Madam. What sisters! How they love eachother! "The National Lottery: You can win $5 million" -Here are the lucky numbers...! -...Miss, I have the $5 million! -The boss is furious with you for being late. -How terrible! And Mr. Dom?nguez is waiting on you. What's wrong? Besides being late, have you no respect for the customer? Apologize! Mr. Dom?nguez has been waiting on you! "National Lottery. 5 Millions" There goes your detective. Tired? Not now. You've had a terrible day. One after another... Yes, terrible. You're too impressionable. It did you no good going to the cemetery. I'll toughen up someday... I'll face things coldly... I'll even act coldly. I don't know you when you speak like that. You seem... As if even your own voice changed and you became a different woman. What a strange sensation! To see the city from above... Behind every light in every home... ...there exists an intense world... ...of whose suffering and misery we know nothing of. Why not their hopes and their joys? Must everything be pain down there? At night, when entering my room... I feel that someone far over there looks at the light in my window. What little he sees! Yet, see what we see when we look at it with love... Over there... Behind that light... Someone is up studying. Perhaps nearer there, a woman is giving birth... Or a man is reuniting with the woman he loves. ...And everywhere, life is full of yearning, effort and faith. Even a hard road offers, at least, the joy of living. Living... If I may trouble you, Maria... if you don't mind, Mr. Roberto... I have your bill of rent, which is now days overdue. Please wait until Saturday, my payday. This is only my first week of work. Fine. What can we do? God help you, Mariquita. Good night. Something must be done to get out of this situation. What can one do? Nothing. You resign yourself to this absurd life or you give up living. For god's sake, Maria, don't talk like that. It makes you feel distant... As if there was an abyss between you and I. You only see the bad in life, whereas together we could build find happiness. What a taste for daydreams! What kind of life would we get by joining our misery? ...our misfortunes? I, for my part, could never do it. Enough! Roberto! Forgive me... It's just that I've been so nervous, so sad all day! Tell me you love me. Now leave me. I'm real tired. Meet me at work tomorrow. Until tomorrow. "Mrs. Magdalena, the tea is served." Yes... Yes, Don Francisco... You know that, Mr. Dom?nguez. Anything we can do... Yes, Mr. Dom?nguez... Same exact time... Oh, no, no... Thank you, Mr. Dom?nguez. Immediately, Mr. Dom?nguez. Merry Christmas, Mr. de Cordova. Ms. M?ndez! Could you be so kind? Go to the apartment of Mr. Dom?nguez and attend to him. -Could you be see kind as to let me go? -What? Pay me what you owe me. I no longer work here. How's this? What's gotten into you? You heard me. I'm a manicurist. Not what you think. Fine! Let me add this up. This is what I get for being compassionate! 20 pesos... plus Sunday... makes 25. Minus washing... Minus a pair of clippers... A bottle of nail polish... You're left with... $18.25 What a nice Christmas you'll have! You've made your bed... Here! -Show me that cigarette case, please? -With pleasure. It's precious! It must be expensive. -No, ma'am. Only $70. How much are you looking to spend? $18. Here's one. It'll do. I'll take it. I got you something for Christmas. No. You shouldn't have, Maria. I brought you this. Tell me if you like it. "'Always'" Don't be sad on a day like this, Maruca, when all the world's happy. Yes, happy out of obligation. If it's your job, no worries. Nothing better could have happened. Starting today, you only work at home. Things will change soon, and then we can marry. It's as if you live on the moon! Life is not what you imagine it to be. At times, I feel that there is no salvation left. Don't be like that, Maruca. You seem more pessimistic everyday. With less hope in the future. Don't think that! I'd like to give you all my confidence, all my enthusiasm. As soon as I get on a big case, I'll make head detective for sure. I've no lack of opportunities. $5 million tomorrow! -It's now or never... -By god, shut up! You're driving me crazy! Why do you act like this? ...like a different person? Roberto... It's that I have so many problems! So much fear! But don't worry... It's passed. It's nothing. How good and sweet you are, Maria! 'Beto... I have to go. -Go? Where? To see my sister. Okay... your sister. Let's go. Couldn't I see you after? No, Roberto. I want to be alone. I need to be alone. Goodbye. Goodbye. Merry Christmas, Roberto. Madam, after the rosary, will they be staying for dinner? No, I'm too tired for more guests. Thank god that this is the last rosary! I'll answer. Yes... It's you. Can't it wait another day? But this is nonsense! Have you gone crazy? You can't do this to me! Alright... If that's what you want, I'll go. If only to convince you. Bye, my beloved. Tell Pascual to get the car ready. If the guests arrive, tell them... No, better to say nothing. I'll be right back. -Is it serious, madam? One of my sister's customary episodes! Some money for fireworks, ma'am? Here... split it! You seem calm. Yet, you seem nervous. What you told me on the phone was in the worst taste imaginable! It has nothing to do with taste. Sit. We have to talk. You're not really thinking of killing yourself? What a romantic! ...And in the 20th Century! If it's about money, I could give you a sum. Not much, but something. Thanks. It's not money I need. Least from you. There are things more important than money. I wanted to see you. I wanted to tell you how I feel. And? I close my eyes and see you always pacing behind me. You've been determined to load my soul with bitterness and poison. I've never hated, Magdalena... But today I hate with all my being. And Lord knows what ordeals I've had so as to bring me to this moment! You wouldn't do it in front of me! Guess again. To be late in these circumstances! On Christmas, when people have commitments. It's shameful. At least they seem to be enjoying themselves... We shall commence whenever you are ready, Madam. Right now, counselor. -...Pray for Him! -Venerable Virgin... -Pray for Him! -Laudable Virgin... -Pray for Him! -Powerful Virgin... -Pray for Him! -Merciful Virgin... ...Faithful Virgin... ...Mirror of justice... ...Throne of Wisdom... ...Source of all our joy... ...Spiritual vessel of choice... ...Precious vessel of grace... Oh, it's my lady, Mrs. Magdalena. Your bath is ready, madam. You seem quiet. Did something happen with your sister? My sister? Did I say something about my sister? Didn't you see her? That's right... I thought you meant something else. I don't know where my head is at. No. Nothing's happened to Mar?a. Just a tempest in a teacup. Thank goodness... May I help you undress? -No thanks. You may retire. Have a good evening, madam. "Nembutal" Mrs. Magdalena! Madam! What's going on? There are two people here to see you. They say they're with the police. Did you hear me, madam? Tell them to wait. Good morning. How may I help you? Forgive us, but you must come with us. -What? I don't understand. -Let me explain... We simply need a statement, regarding what happened to your sister. My sister? Did something happen? Let's go. I'll tell them to get the car! -There's no need, ma'am. We have instructions to take you there ourselves. That's fine. I'll be right back. ...the witness never suspected that the victim could ever go as far as suicide. On the night in question, the deceased showed signs of depression. Did the deceased give you any hints of her intentions? Any allusions or phrases? I was unable to understand her... Now I see all her actions pointed towards suicide. However, I still refuse to believe it! I refuse to believe it, because... And you should understand this... ...this woman was the love of my life! Take down these words... Mrs. Montes de Oca, if you will? Mrs. Montes de Oca... please. Excuse me, but... It's such a shock! -It's simply a formality, madam... ...as your twin sister left a letter addressed to you... ...and which, understandably, we've already opened. Please read it. No... I can't! Fine. Then listen... "Dear Sister, my only regret is the pain this'll cause you... ...now that you're alone in the world. But when one's been condemned to a life of suffering, as I have... ...only last resorts are of any use. May you and God forgive me." Now, we'll need a statement from you... about your visit to her on the night in question.... ...and if you noted anything to make you aware of her suicidal intentions. My statement is simple... I visited my sister because she asked me to by phone... ...claiming she couldn't come to the rosary. The rosary we celebrate each night for the soul of my late husband. I found her, it's true, in a state of great depression. I didn't want to leave her until I knew she felt better. That's how it went. At 10 p.m., I returned home, with no suspicion of what would happen. Thank you, ma'am. According to our coroner, your sister died one hour after you left her room. I have one last inconvenience, but law requires me: You and Mr. Gonzales, who knew the deceased so well... ...must identify the body. No! It's impossible! I couldn't! -Please... -Be strong, madam. I'll be with you. You're still very pale, madam. Yes... No. I feel better. Nevertheless, I'd like to buy you a cup of coffee. How elegant, Mariquita! You've never looked prettier. I've always said you should lose those spectacles. Remember? -Two coffees! -Right away. I don't what hidden, unknown impulse governs our actions at times... and makes us commit the most thoughtless actions... and the most painful. What are you trying to tell me? What's this about? I'm just trying to recall how I met her in this place. -Here? -Yes. It was our meeting place. We'd have long, sincere talks here. You loved her deeply? She never knew to what depths. I didn't know how to tell her She should have known how much I loved her. How terribly much I loved her! She would have never done what she did! But at no point, by any miracle, could I find the words. When I was ready to speak with all my passion and soul... ...some invisible wall would rise up between us! She was my life and death... My heaven and hell... Everything a man could hope for in this world! Now, when it's too late, you say it! Why couldn't you do it while there was still a chance? Why? And her... Why couldn't she see it? How could she be so blind? So terribly blind! You poor thing! ...And poor Mar?a! My poor sister. You who yearned so badly for wealth... ...had the greatest of all riches in grasp... ..and you threw it away! That's how things go. Her last gift... Get me out of here, Roberto! I want to leave! I want no more of your memories! "...and as the deceased, having met all necessary and legal conditions... ...it shall be known to the party concerned that the rightful heir... ...to all assets of Mr. Don Victoriano Montes de Oca... ...is his wife, Mrs. Magdalena Mendez, widow of Montes de Oca... ...to be provided annually with the sum of $500,000, for personal use... ...to be taken from the $5 million in her name at the National Bank of Mexico. The heiress must also present her sister, Mar?a, with $100,000... ...as well as the deed to house 58, on the roads of Campo Florido. As for personal and real property they shall pass to Public Assistance... ...all art objects are to be donated to the National Museum of Art. Until then, they are to be kept with the widow, in custody of the executor. ...So certify I." Please, the witness's signature. And your's, Mrs. Montes de Oca. Please. Your signature, madam. No, I can't! Excuse me, but I can't! What's wrong? Do you feel unwell? My sister dead... ...unable to enjoy her rightful share! What a disgrace! Calm yourself, madam. Calm yourself. These are God's designs, and his alone. You might be right. "God's designs... His alone..." Tomorrow, or another day... Then I'll sign! -Is that any problem for you? -No. None at all. You can send for me whenever you're ready. "Notary Public No. 7. Lic. Felix Mendoza" Here is your copy. Your new signature has been recorded. Don't laugh at me, counselor. You don't know how annoying it is to write left-handed. -So, this one? -Yes. Those three as well. -Very well. -Magdalena, a hundred blessings! -Thank you. How lovely you look! I wish you only the best! -Madam... may all your days be as nice. -Many thanks. -Carmelita! -Fernando! How are you? What a surprise! -Oh, but you shouldn't have! -Please, madam... -Excuse me, but I must pull her away. -But why? -What's this about? -If I tell you it won't be a surprise. You'll thank me. How I've wanted to see you, Magdalena. And now... we're alone. Thanks to Carmela, who brought me here in secret. -Yes. Carmela... What a surprise! Why so nervous? No... it's just that... These last six months... ...these six eternities... there wasn't a moment I didn't dream of you. How pretty you look. Please, forgive me... ...but the guests will notice I'm gone. Come. Excuse us, Fernando. What do you think of Fernando? -Fernando? It was rash! People may talk. So what? It's only natural! People have been expecting this moment. -Yeah? -Of course! Where have you kept this marvel hidden? Did you just buy it? I've never seen it before. Yes. Not too long ago. How curious... Before her husband's death, she didn't like jewelry. But that broach must cost a fortune! -Her millions won't last long that way. -She'll have plenty of help with that. Bored? No. Delighted! But when will will be through with these... people? -Counselor. -Good evening, madam. -It was enchanting... -Have a good night, Magdalena. Good night. What's the matter? Surprised? You act like it's the first time. -Try to understand. This is absurd! And to do it so publicly, with all these people! Why not? What's stopping us now? Don't we love eachother enough not to care? Yes, Fernando, but... Let me go! I have a terrible headache. I don't know how I'm still standing. Be reasonable. Poor thing. Alright. I'll be reasonable. But I won't let you miss visiting my new flat tomorrow. At 5 p.m. Like before. 5 p.m... I'll be waiting for you. Hello... Yes... Fernando! I've been waiting for a half hour! What's going on? Why are you still there? It's just that... ...I decided not to go. So... you decided not to come? What a surprise! You telling me you're still sick? Look here! Cut the excuses with me! This isn't just about love. You know that! I need to see you and you need to come! Got it! I suggest you quit taking this widow act so serious... Mrs. Montes de Oca! Hello... Fernando! Come in. Sit down. Your coyness reminds me of the first day you saw my flat. You remember this miniature we bought... Well... ...that you bought at the Gal?ria Toledo. And this... It doesn't spark your memory at all? You swore we'd never be apart! We'd stay together until the end, despite it all! These things can't continue as before! Forget about all this, my love... and don't worry. These lips will never tell. What do you mean? Don't bother with that. You know what I'm speaking of. Let's not spoil this moment with unpleasant memories. Good morning, madam. Withdrawing all your money, Madam? I'll re-establish the balance soon. By next week. Sir... Thank you, my man. I see you're punctual and know how to keep your commitments. Tell me if they're all there... since you know them so well. Am I familiar? How many times did I myself pick them out for your husband? These diamonds. These emeralds. Your box of jewels is a testament to my good taste! I could care less if that's what it takes to get you out of my life! So ungrateful. After all the risks we shared. What happy times, when you still loved me! Lies! I never loved you! Not once in my life! Just because you've changed doesn't mean you never loved me. I don't care. I just want you to vanish from my life! If I decide to stay? I'm prepared to do anything to make sure you don't. If I'm to be kept from living my life, it'll be in a prison cell... ...and not by this insane slavery! How different you look from that woman who was once willing to kill for love. Sure, you could kill me... You might even want to! ...but you wouldn't dare. You took part in the perfect crime... Subtle, cunning, leaving no trace. You'd never descend to something as crude as a revolver. You'd kill me meticulously... ...carefully... scientifically... The way you killed... That's right... The way we killed your husband. ...But not with bullets. Put down that useless gun! How useless and vain... ...it all now seems! Don't make it so tragic. Our separation is for the best. More conventional. I'm sure it's hard on you, but it's not easy for me either. Deep down, I'll always love you... -Enough! I don't want to hear another word. I believe you've been sufficiently repaid. ...or not? This can never be repaid! And this, today, is far too little, if I'm honest. But let's forget this vulgarity. Our farewell should be more... ...poetic. I want to remember you as you are now: made more beautiful by anger... lovelier than usual... ...before this grand painting, seemingly made only to illuminate you. I've always been a great admirer of El Greco. Always. I can't stay in Mexico any longer, counselor! I have the firm intention of traveling. But your finances are exhausted, madam. You have already used up all your funds for the year... That doesn't matter. You can obtain money for me with no difficulty: Credit, loans...who knows? Forgive me, madam, but speaking frankly as a friend... You have shown poor conduct by squandering your fortune so recklessly. That's my business. I simply need to know, as my lawyer, can you procure this money. Yes or no? Naturally, as a lawyer, yes. But I don't want to be responsible for what might happen. Thank you. I'll expect you at my house tomorrow. ...I'll send you a cable from New York. Lisbon. Hotel Ambassador... Yes. Thank you. Bye, Carmela. Madam... Counselor De la Fuente is waiting in the library. The library? Who let him in? Didn't I give strict orders that no one's to enter the library? Good day, counselor. Did you wait long? -It was nothing: Only a half hour spent preparing the documents. Here's your passport. I obtained letters for deductions at the Bank of Mexico. If you need a bigger amount, I can wire it to you in Lisbon. -Where do I sign? -Here. There it is. Many thanks. Until we meet again, counselor. One last question, madam... Yes. Do you remember... ...that the trust at the National Museum of Art named me executor... ...to the art collection left by your late husband to the institution? Now I notice with alarm that El Greco is missing! You didn't...? -My god! It can't be! I gave no order. -Madam... This is a painting valued at over a quarter-million! -Is that all, sir? -Yes. You may leave. Chief of police? Police Headquarters? One moment. Yes? Right away. At 1720? Mrs. Magdalena Mendez, widow of Montes de Oca. I'll send two agents. The home of Mrs. Montes de Oca? -Any particular interest? -I know her well. What happened? Nothing important. A simple robbery. I'd like to be on this case, if you'll allow. -Alright. You're partners with Aguilar. ...And it was right there. I'd like to see Mrs. Montes de Oca. -Come with me. There she is. These officers are here to investigate the missing painting. This isn't our first time meeting, correct? No. And, for shame, always in the worst of circumstances. Don't worry. I'll do everything possible to solve this case. Has anyone been thinking of leaving? Yes... Me. I'm afraid it won't be possible. You'll have stay here until it's over. -Something like an arrest? -Nothing like that, madam. You're absolutely free. Absolutely free not to do as I please. How absurd! Believe me, it's not my doing. The painting belongs to the government. I'll have to question everyone who lives in this house. Why did you allow Counselor De la Fuente into the library... ...when you had specific orders from Madam not to allow anyone? De la Fuente himself asked me for the keys. I always handle her affairs in the library as it's the most suitable room. As such, it's only natural I ask for the keys. I found Fernando alone in the library, viewing the canvass with great interest. He didn't notice I was there until I spoke. That's all I know! You still have the letter Mar?a left you. Yes. For me, that card represents man's greatest problem: A life that could have been, but wasn't. A desire which followed the most twisted and wayward of paths. "The most twisted and wayward of paths..." Forget about it, Magdalena. It's so difficult. Tell me, Roberto... Do you still love her? The way you love something you can only touch in a dream. Something dead and gone to which you can never return. If you could only return to the past. How can you say such a thing? Looking at you, I find it hard to believe you could ever be so tormented. You must have certainly been loved once. Yes. But it too is something that will never return. A hopeless memory. Your husband? No. Destiny has always pulled me away from the things I love. And now, when I look back... How I envy my sister for the way you lover her! It's wonderful to feel loved! I'm rich. I can have anything I want. I'm the widow of Montes de Oca! The millionairess! But the loneliest and saddest... ...of all women. Magdalena... For one moment, while hearing your voice... I had an extraordinary feeling. Without seeing her... ...simply hearing her, I felt near Mar?a. The same expressions, same words, same tone. I was transported to a sweet and impossible world. Please, keep speaking. I don't know why I'm talking to you like this, Roberto. It must be my infinite thirst for love. My desire to feel someone next to me... ...and for someone to show me the tenderness that I need. Forgive me. Gonz?lez, we have orders to go to the train station immediately. Excuse me, ma'am. This has to end now, ma'am. You can't keep hiding the facts. He says that you yourself gave him the paining. Is this true or not? It's true. Everything he says. Madam, do you know what this means? If you knew the painting belonged to the museum, why did you give it to him? The answer is very simple. I love him. "Blessed are those who die in the Lord" Your suspicions still seem outlandish to me. Let's hope we're wrong. I'm certain that we're not mistaken. She lied to cover up being a victim of blackmail. This is that blackmail! Traces of arsenic. The poison appears to have been administered and working... ...over a long period time. No mistake. -Thank you. Enough! Enough! Please, no more! I'll tell you everything I know! She can explain the rest! -"She"! Always "she"! Judging the facts with all conscience and honesty... ...and in light of intervening circumstances... ...which establish, beyond a doubt, the crime of homicide... ...committed with premeditation, cold-blood and for personal gain,... ...I, Judge of the 7th District, hereby sentence the accused... ...Magdalena Mendez, widow to Montes de Oca, guilty of her husband's death... ...to the maximum sentence of 30 years in prison... ...a sentence to begin immediately at the district penitentiary. In Mexico, Distrito Federal, the 24th of December, 1945. Court is adjourned. "Premeditation... and for personal gain." You fulfilled your duty very well. I hope you won't bear a grudge with me. No, Roberto. My debt of blood must be paid. It's God's justice. Your resignation reminds me of your sister. We were so alike. Mar?a could never have been capable of murder. How grateful I am that you haven't allowed her legacy to be tarnished. I don't see why you should be. For me... It's as if she never died. As if she never died... Enough of this! This is where I stand: I don't deny my guilt! It's as true as my name is Magdalena Mendez, widow of Montes de Oca! Magdalena Mendez, widow of Montes de Oca, coming in! Merry Christmas. Roberto. The End. Subtitles by the KG community.
