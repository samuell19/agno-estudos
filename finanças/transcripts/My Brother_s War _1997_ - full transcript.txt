Connel, may I present to you my big brother, John. John, this is Connel Byrne, the nervous groom to be. - [Connel] Very pleased to meet you. - Hi, how are you? - The least I can do is get your bags. - Thanks. - [Kelly] so what do you think? - Seems very nice. - I think Mom and Dad would have liked him. - You know a young Irish lad, went to Notre Dame and almost became a priest. Honey, their socks would roll up and down. (laughing) No, trust me, no, they'd have liked him all right. Come on, let's go get you married. - [Jimmy] Your life is mine. My life is yours. And life is what it's all about. And when we get what we deserve, life is hard to figure out. But things are always not the same and who we are is not to blame. And if one day we end up dead, Mother, cover up my head. - Come on Jimmy, we're running behind. They'll follow this road along the promenade. - Liam, you'll be here. - No, not me. Send Sinead there. - We don't want them doubting us before we get set up. - And what about here? The motorcade's passing right in front there. If you want someone over there send Sinead. - OK. Right, when the car reaches this point we set off. Sinead, are you certain his wife and kids won't be along? - It's been confirmed. - Why don't we set it up over here on the side of the road? - There's too many people there. - Exactly, what do you think I'm talking about? - We're only interested in the royal, Liam. - What, are you stupid? More bodies means more press. Better for the movement. Jimmy, why the fuck is she talking? She's got no say about this. - Wrong, sonny. You've got a lot to learn. The movement doesn't gain support by blowing up innocent women and children. Our brothers in the states are quite sentimental about the weak and the defenseless being victimized. You follow? (thudding) (door slamming) - Gerry, Liam's in on this with us isn't he? - I'll have no talk of that. He's as part of this movement as you and I. You have something to say to him you say it to his face. - Jesus, sorry. (door closing) - He's as good ever I was, maybe better. - Aye, and that's just what worries me. (dogs barking) - Don't you ever question me like that in from of Gerry again, you hear? - OK. We'll have to sort this out together. You know maybe we got off on the wrong foot. Maybe you can see things a bit differently. - What are you talking about? - How come you don't have a girlfriend, Liam? - I have to stay focused. (kissing) (Liam breathing heavily) - What's wrong, are you a virgin? (Liam chuckling) You haven't done this before have you? (laughing) What's wrong, Liam? Are you afraid of women? (dramatic music) - You're gonna get yours, you bitch. (light jazz music) - Buy me a drink, soldier? - Mind if take your wee sister on the road to damnation? - As long as you take a map. - Something brewing there? - Brewing? It's bloody fermented. He's loved her since she was six. - What are you thinking? What's that? I'm not real strong on body language. - Liam, haven't seen him all night. He left upset. I worry, you know. - You can't be his protector forever, Gerry. If you don't take him away from your tit, he's never gonna grow up is he? - Cheers. (glasses clinking) - Tits. - Will you come by later? - Can't. Not now, Mary, just isn't right. - What isn't? - Not when I have another woman's photograph on my bedstead. Sorry. (light blues music) - Gerry, Fiona's wake is long past. The mourning period is over. (glasses clinking) (knocking) - McMann was just in here with a fifth of Bushmill. I haven't seen him since. Use the alleyway. Everybody else does. - Seems good to me. (unzipping) (trickling) - Hey Ger, watch your shoes will ya? Here, here. That's a good girl. You like that? That's a good girl. - I see your taste in females is improving. - She's so little. Don't think her mom's even weened her yet. Last, I think. Oh, yeah. - Come inside for a while. - Don't think so, big brother. Have to keep the temple pure. - Thought your friend could use some company. - Thanks very much, Gerry boy. (meowing) But I don't quite fit in. (meowing) - Got an early start in the morning. - Then you best be getting on home. Wouldn't want you to be fatigued tomorrow. And pull a muscle. - Right. - That's a little girl. Where you going? Where you going little girl, huh? (accordion music) (chattering) - So, what did you think? - Oh, you look beautiful. Hey, what are we, crazy? Ice cream in the winter? - Oh, it's freezing. Thanks. - So, Connel, your family live around here? - Uh huh. Cousins, brothers, sisters, the lot. - And your folks? - Connel's parents were killed in the travels a few years back, a bomb. - Yeah, stupid bloody war. - Sorry. (ominous music) (beeping) (laughing) - Oh. (laughing) - Oh, I wanted that, too. - I'll get you another one. - Almost there, get ready. Sinead. Sinead. - Jesus, Ger, I swear. - I said no children. - This doesn't change anything. We do it. - What the hell? No. - There you go, no chocolate. - Thanks. Hey, who is that? Look, honey. - What's all this? - Visiting. Most likely a Brit. - Give it to me. - This is my time. - No. - Where'd you guys go? Kelly? - John. Over here. - Stupid, give it to me. - Leave it alone. - You stupid bastard. I should have stood on your crypt when I had a chance. (ominous music) (gun firing) - Gun. There's a gun. Hold it. Sniper. - What are you doing, are you mad? - Sniper, there. - Go. Back. (gun firing) - [John] That's who I am. - Let's go. - All right, ladies and gents, get back in your cars. There's nothing to see here. Let's go, lad. Keep it moving, let's go, let's go, let's go, get back in your cars, start 'em up. (gun shooting) (ethereal music) - I guess you can take the boy out of the CIA, but you can't take the CIA out of the boy. - No more smart ass comments. (tense music) - It's my turn. (beeping) (exploding) (yelling) (laughing) (chattering) (sirens blaring) (chattering) (accordion music) - Got one live one. (chattering) (TV chattering) - [Announcer] Police have arrested splinter group leader Gerry Fallon, who was critically wounded in the foray. Two additional members of the group are dead. Officers are searching the area for additional suspects. - Tried to stop him. He went mad. - Sit down. - Tell us exactly what happened. (sirens blaring) - I want all. More preps in ready in five minutes, we're gonna lose this man. Five units of multi plasma stat, move. - Not with the woman and kid in the car. Back for the movement, but, he wouldn't listen. You know his temper. And then. Sinead started firing back at him. I managed to run out of the room without being hit. And then I come back in the room, dead. He's dead. Me own brother. (crying) Where's me brother? - Easy, son. Go easy. - Excuse me. Just got word from hospital. Gerry's been shot up bad, but he's still alive. - Then it's in God's hands now. - [Judge] Gerald Anthony Fallon. You have been found guilty on 12 counts of murder in the first degree. This is one of the most heinous and cowardly acts of brutality I have encountered in my 15 years serving Her Majesty's court. For said acts, I sentence you to serve life imprisonment. With my recommendation there should be no parole. And may God have mercy on your miserable soul. (chattering) - Mary, wait, you can't go in there. - Just who the hell do you think you are, you conniving little bastard? You owe me some answers. - I don't know what answers you're talking about. O'Dey, do you mind? This is personal. Listen, here, you stupid bitch. Don't you ever come in here and talk to me like that in front of my men. - My, my. You are full of self importance, aren't ya? Don't forget, little Liam, I know you. You're a lying, vicious cheat who's happy to let his brother serve life up in that stinking hole for something I know you did. You'll get what's coming to you. - Get out. - You haven't heard the last of me. - I know where you and yours live. (smashing) (squawking) - [Gerry] I know that it may seem hard, Mary, but I really think it's for the best. It may seem selfish to you, but I couldn't handle it if you were to keep on visiting me. I know what a fool I've been in letting you slip away. I have a long time to think about these things. And God knows, I have enough demons of guilt on my head. If you feel as strongly for me as I do for you, give me the peace of letting me go. All my love, Gerry. (ethereal music) - [Reporter] It is said the United States may offer to act as an intermediary in peace talks. There is concern as to whether loyalists or republican paramilitary's will agree to a temporary ceasefire prior to the talks. Sources from both sides are optimistic that these talks may finally lead to the building blocks of peace. - Never lasts, girl. - Maryland senator Peter Roberts-- - Never lasts. - --expressed grave concerns about whether the republicans were willing to end the fight. (classical music) - [Reporter] This bulletin just in from the BBC's Ireland news desk. Peace talks are now underway between the British government and (foreign language spoken), the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, said to be brokered by the US secretary of. - This way. - Be quiet. (chattering) - Quiet down. Now everybody just stay calm. I've just spoken with our political representative. He says the process is for real. And they expect it to stay real for some time. I, for one, am glad to see it quiet down for a while. The older you get, the more the fighting spirit gets taken from you. I want all unit commanders to assemble their men, collect their weapons, and turn them into us by 0900. This war stops now. - Well, you said one thing right, John Feeney. You are an old withered bastard. Because only an old withered bastard like yourself would buy into this kind of bullshit. - Not my decision, Liam. Orders from upstairs. As a soldier, I do what I'm told. - Well, your upstairs is getting old, too. And a good leader knows that there's a time to obey orders and a time to stand for what he believes in. What do you believe in, John? - I believe that you're much younger and much stronger than I am. And if you don't get down off your high horse, I'm gonna knock your bollocks into your throat, and send you packing home in shit kick nappies. There was a time when I could have had you shot, skinned, and stuffed like a Christmas goose, son. Don't think I still won't. - Come on, lads. (chattering) - You all agree with me, then? We have to act fast. I mean tonight. - Yeah. - You know the place. And boys. Come prepared. It's our fight now. Let's go. (chattering) (dialing) - What's all this then? You know I exercise alone. - Somebody decided you need to make more friends, Gerry. Consider it a social. (tense music) - That's him, planted the bomb that killed me da. How are you, Gerry? Been wanting to make your acquaintance for some time, I have. (groaning) (chattering) - If the government doesn't move in soon, we'll have a bloody riot on our hands. (chattering) - [Man] Never get out alive. (chattering) - Just give me the ball. (chattering) (grunting) - No, don't. (grunting) Stop it. - What are you doing? - Don't mind if we kick the shit out of your retarded little brother, do you, Gerry boy? - If he can't fight, that's his problem. (grunting) (chattering) - Well, lads, looks as though we're an active jury, one last time. - I'm gonna catch up with Feeney and OD. So I want you two to stay here. Just find somewhere. - If we ever hope to have a free Irish state, it's for the English to be out 100%. That means no bargaining, no molly coddling, and no damn cease fire. Not until we have our freedom. Are you with me, brothers? - Yeah. - I can't hear you. Are you with me? (yelling) - Looks like there's three of them coming. OD, Fagen, and Feeney. - Grand. You all know your positions, then? Make it count. (tense music) (gun cocking) (knocking) Who is it? - It's John Feeney, Liam. - What can I do for you, boys? - You're a fool. Bringing men here. Only the four of us are supposed to know about this site. You're just a bunch of little boys. - Boys? (gun shooting) (yelling) (guns shooting) - Fagen's getting away. (gun shooting) - You're a lucky one, Fagen. When they come and ask you who did all this, you'll tell them brothers in arms, won't you? That's a good lad. - OK. Let's try another one, shall we? What do you see? - Sunset, over the water. - Very good, Gerry. Let's try another one. - A flower. A pretty flower. - Pretty flower. Nice. Well, my time's up. That's really good, Gerry. I think you've come a long way. I think there's hope. Wonderful hope. Don't you? Gerry, they've asked me to inquire the whereabouts of your brother. - Get the fuck out. - Let's go, lad. - Right. (tense music) (ominous music) - Boom. On your knees, then. Come on now, hurry up. On your knees. It's only the money I want. Hurry up now lads. I was joking about only being interested in the money. There are much more important things in life. (gun shooting) (classical music) - John. John. - Shit. Hey, Lee. - Got to get a phone out here, John. - Well. Lee, what are you doing up here? I hope you brought your fly rod with ya, and that's it. - Let's get on, shall we? Will you join us, Mr. Hall? We just received this. Only if you don't mind, Bracket. - You'll notice, this isn't tomato ketchup. Nor is it the set of a Hollywood film. This is reality. We're a group of patriots, who don't believe in the sham of a peace process that the British, using the Americans are pushing upon our people. We intend to derail it by any means necessary. And everybody is a target. Remember who we are. Brothers in arms. Welcome to the war. - I don't know where they're getting their information, but my security sources believe this to be a significant threat. The men, the money. - Earlier this week, two leading republican activists were killed, it's believed, while attempting to retrieve their weapon arsenal, as part of their decommissioning. We believe that the same man in this video killed them, and now has their entire explosive store. Liam Fallon. Ring any bells, John? - Oh yeah. You know I know him. - I simply can't have these loonies mucking up our plans. Your secretary of state is also arriving. Covertly, I might add, to help with the process. I want this thing taken care of. You understand me. - Thank you, Sir Phillip. Can we talk alone for a second? Pompous bastard. - Look, Lee-- - OK, John, now wait. Please. Listen for a sec, will you? Now you'll be working with the British, but there may be something of personal interest to you on this. After you arrive at Belfast, you'll be going straight to interview Gerry Fallon. He's willing to cooperate. - Gerry Fallon? You've got to be kidding. The only way I ever want to see Gerry Fallon again is with my gun in his mouth. No, Lee, I don't need this aggravation, I don't want it. - Truth is, you have no choice. - Bullshit. Not a chance. - Let's go. - Like me to leave, sir? - No, you better stay. - I'm harmless enough. - It's not you I'm worried about, Gerry. My name's John Hall. Sound familiar? - Can I have a smoke? - Where's your brother? - Somewhere in Ireland. - Oh. You like games. Gerard Anthony Fallon, born in 1957, Belfast, first arrested for assaulting a British army officer in 1972. Received scholarship to Trinity College, Dublin, dropped out final year after death of mother. Father Michael shot to death, April 1969. Wife accidentally killed by a plastic bullet July 1988. - There are no accidents with plastic bullets. - Where's Liam? - With all due respect to yourself, Mr. Hall. And whoever you're working for. If you go after Liam, with just yourself and those proper British bobbies backing you, they're gonna find you in a barn somewhere. Cut from throat to dick. - What are you saying? - If you want Liam, I'll give him to you. But not in here. - You think I'm gonna get you out of here? You're crazy. I came a long way. I was told you agreed to give full cooperation. - Can't have much cooperation behind six feet of stone. Clock's ticking. - Sergeant. - Yes, sir. - Beautiful country. But all it takes is one look at people like you to know why my grandparents left. - Appreciate the vote of confidence. - Where to, first? - A fellow called Brian Fagen. - Yeah, what about him? - He's a good man. Probably only friend I have left. - You want to drop the anonymous tip before your trial? - What tip was that? - That Liam's the one that blew up the Liden family. And my sister. - Don't know about that. - So was it you? - I never said push the button. - Well, if you weren't responsible, then why didn't you say something? - I never said that, either. (dog barking) (bluesy music) He did live here. - [John] Excuse me, miss? Is there a Brian Fagen living here? - No. - Do you know what happened to his sister? So, you married George Bailey. Good lad. When's he due back? - George has been dead going on three years now, Gerry. - Christ, Mary, I'm sorry. - RUC picked him up one night coming back from the club. A few of his mates were with the movement, but he never joined. They held him for three weeks, then released him to hospital. He died two days later. Internal injuries, they said. Hopefully those days are coming to a close. - That's why we're here, Mary. We need to see Brian. - Haven't seen him. Not since the incident with Liam. No one has. He'll stay under for a while, I'm guessing. - Who could put the word out, we need to see him. - Mommy, Mommy, look what I did at school today. - Oh, it's lovely. Lucy. This is Mr. Farrel. He's an old friend of your Uncle Brian. - Hello. Are you a bad man? - No, honey. - Bad men are going to kill everybody that killed my daddy. - No, sweetheart. Uncle Brian is going to be fine. - There's still a lot of people who think you're a traitor out there. Be careful showing your face about the streets. - We know that Liam's been recruiting members of bars and pubs very young and very angry. - And you're gonna plant an angry young secret agent man there and file the lot. - In a manner of speaking, yeah, one of the best. - Liam could smell a Brit spy like a ripe fart. - Not this one he won't. (honking) - Tonight, come to the Raiden. It's all about the new truce. Come on by, lads. - Sounds good, Mitt. - So, pick a bunk. It ain't the Ritz, but it's functional. - Can I caution you again, my friend? Liam is not some mugger on the streets. - I'm quite aware of that. - You think people don't know they're moving stuff in here? Your man is about as subtle as a bull in a china shop. - Are you testing me? - I'm saying if you want Liam, you've got to live like him. Underground, on the streets. You got to get inside his head. Think Irish. Feel our pain. - Is that right? You know when my grandfather immigrated to the US, he shortened his name from O'Halleran to Hall because nobody in the city would hire a dirty mick. Does that make me less Irish than you? Because of the geography, is that it? Get smart, Gerry boy. Don't even get being Irish confused with being a damn sociopathic killer. I know that pain. I've lived in the streets and I've been poor. But it will never be an excuse for pulling the maniacal, sick shit that you've pulled. - Thousands were murdered by British occupying security forces. And most of those people, they were civilians. Brothers. And now, they want us to lie down again, like good wee kitties, and declare a cease fire. Because they say so? - Hell no. (chattering) - Now, we're gonna be speaking to each one of ya. Not all of you will make it. But for those of you that do, you'll be telling your grand kiddies about this glorious day when we, the founding fathers, created a free Ireland. Welcome to the revolution, lads. You ever fired a gun before, Devlin? - I don't think so. No. - Have you read Man and Superman or Thus Spake Zarathustra? - No, but I saw the film. - The film? (ominous music) (laughing) O'Brien, Plantis. What do you know about explosives? - Not much. - Ever fired a gun before? - Sure. Did a stint in the territorial army. Only way I could get to play with the boys' guns. I've shot heckler and kush submachinegun. And nine millimeter Beretta. Oh and a Winchester. - A Winchester? That's an old west gun. - Always fancied meself a bit of a Calamity Jane, after I saw Doris Day in the movie. (laughing) - Where you from, Pete? - The Falls. - Aye, so am I. You look familiar to me. What do you know about guns? - Do you mind? - Why are you here? - I'm ready to kill, for you. - These are my people. Let me do the talking. (bluesy music) - What in the name of God in heaven are you doing here, son? - I need to speak to Brian. Where can I find him? - If I was you, I'd be on my way. You've not many friends left around here. - What the bloody hell are you doing here, Johnny Fallon? - I'm not looking for trouble. I need to find Brian Fagen. Can anyone help me? - Help you? Why don't you go and ask Sinead? She's buried not five miles down the road. I'm sure they've gotten that killer's fingerprints buried on it. - Give me a whiskey. - I didn't kill your sister, Patty. I came back to avenge her death. And the death of all the comrades who were killed by my brother. - I'm gonna tear you apart. - That's it, pal. - This is not the way. - Shut up. We tried it your way. Now we're looking for Brian Fagen. You ready to behave yourself? Where? - He's in your mother's place. Giving it hard up the ass. - Enough. So, the first thing is this. We want Liam taken out as badly as you people. And second, you'll get no help from us, so long as that Mickey Mouse Scotland Yard operation stays in our community. - What are the chances of getting to Liam? We've already got someone on the inside. - I put my money on Liam trying something when the US secretary comes for his secret meetings. - I didn't tell him. - Where are you getting your information? Why would they hit the paramilitary talks instead of the government meetings? - The second venue is more isolated. If Liam hits both loyalists and republicans, on the US team, brokering the deal, together, the whole peace process will blow sky high. - What makes you think that's what Liam would do? - Because that's what I'd do. (chattering) (dog barking) (chattering) (gun shooting) - What's the matter? You remember something? - Aye. Come on, I want to show you something. It's over here. She didn't make me in the movement. She said I should have finished my degree. She used to tease me. But eventually I only stayed in the movement to keep an eye on Liam. She said. If I was a part of it, then she had to be a part of it, also. And so was our child. She'd one month ago. - You know. You made your own bed, Fallon. - What's happened? - We just got a tip where your brother and his mates are hanging out, we raid in 30 minutes. I'd like you to come along. - It'll be a suicide mission. He's on to you. - Oh, yeah? What makes you so sure of that? - The old man that did tip you, he wanted it that way. - I didn't stop grieving for my da. No, I didn't. Because I knew it was all part of the plan. The plan to make me what I am today. Your leader. And with God as my witness, the fire that was lit inside me that day outside burns twice as bright, and twice as hot today. Are you ready, brothers? (yelling) Are you ready? (yelling) (ominous music) - [Man] Over here. I'll meet you down here. I'll take him. (chattering) Take it easy. (chattering) (tense music) - You better give me a gun, if you want me to go in there. - Forget it. - All right, then I'm staying here. - Suit yourself. - OK. Here they come. Now. I said now, Francis. - [Man] Control, a bomb here. Roger. - Come in, Francis. (exploding) - [Man] Waiting for back up. Now. - Come on. (gun shooting) (dramatic music) (gun shooting) - [Man] Get to an ambulance. Call for backup. Ambulance, now. (dramatic music) (gun shooting) - They'll head for the docks. Follow me there. - Where are they? - You check inside. You do the platform. I'll do the back exit. - [Announcer] Now boarding. - You're under arrest. Put your hands up. RUC undercover. (laughing) I'll empty this gun into your face and go out for a pint afterward. Don't push me. - [Announcer] Last call, all aboard. - I was wondering what you were waiting for, Francis. Such a pity, on the wrong side. I was growing fond of you, Francis. Getting feelings about you. Feelings I always wondered if I had. Know what I mean? - You are one sick individual. And I'm here to put you down. (clicking) (stabbing) (ominous music) - Oh Christ, no. - Shit, the train. - Long live the movement, Liam, boy. - Gerry. - Nice night, eh, big brother? - Gerry, take him. - Put the knife down, eh? - Come on, don't be stupid, man. - Gerry, for Christ sake, what are you doing? Take him now. - Gerry, come on. - Gerry, what are you doing? Give me the gun. (tense music) (laughing) - Long live the movement, Gerry boy. (laughing) - Can I just listen? Gerry says he'll meet you at the social club tomorrow night, half past six. - Where is he? You tell that little prick to get back here now. - I said listen, Mr. Hall. Everything you've done so far has turned around and bitten you in the arse, and now a lot of people are dead. You want Liam? You do it our way. You're working for us now. Welcome to the movement. - Wait a minute, damn it. Shit. - Why didn't you take Liam out back there? - Maybe I'm not the same man since prison. - Maybe Liam is better than you now. - Just trust me, Brian. I sort him out. Just trust me. Look. I'm gonna call around and see Mary. - Hey. Do you need a map? - No thanks. I remember the way. (laughing) (sentimental music) - What are you thinking? - I was thinking about when we were kids. I remember my parents used to say this is our wee lad, Gerry, the football star. He's going to play in the all Ireland some day. And this is our other wee lad, Liam. His brother. - Christ, you're still going over this old stuff. - What? - I don't have time for any more victims in my life, Gerry. I've had enough. Everybody around us has lost someone we love to this stupid, bloody war. Get over it. - I wasn't talking about the war. I was talking about family. - Liam is not your problem to solve, he never was. - What do you know about it? (sentimental music) - I know that there are some problems that can't be solved. Not by he likes of us, anyway. All that's important now is what you can do something about. I love you, Gerry, I always have. Lucy, she's smitten by you. And to Brian, you're the brother he never had. I can't force you to do nothing. But if it's family you want, it's right here, for you to take. All you want. - Mr. Hall, I presume. Charles Erickson, your, well, I guess you'd say replacement. Here to set up security for the US secretary's visit. - And you're also here to piss me off. - No, sir. Let's avoid that. To be honest with you, the agency sent me out here quite unexpectedly and truth is, it'd be helpful if we had someone aboard who knew what was going on around here. Because I sure as hell do not. - Come on, I'll show you around. Keep the change. - It's already been taken care of. (bluesy music) - I should arrest you, you know. - But that'd be boring. - Yeah. Yeah, it would. - I thought you'd be back in the states by now. - Your little brother killed and wounded a lot of my men. That pisses me off. - Very Irish of you. - I keep telling you, O'Halleran's the name. So what do you think he'll hit? - The talk in the country house. I think. - What did Brian mean when he said I was working for you now? What do we do 'til then? - Have another pint. (gun shooting) - Excellent. How we doing, lads? - Doing well. - About 1600. (gun shooting) (chattering) - Come here little puppy, come on. (whining) It's OK, it's OK, doggie. Get closer to the window. Come here, it's OK. It's OK. (whining) - What are you doing? - Another little one scream. - I asked you a question, soldier. - What are you, playing the general here? - What did you say? - I said who the fuck are you? Alec Guinness? Mind your own fucking business. (grunting) - Don't you ever let me catch you touching an animal again, you hear? - Well, General, you just made a big mistake, my friend. I tell you what. Why don't you take a bite of this? You don't remember me, do ya? Asthmatic little piece of shit. Come on. Oh, that was a nice one. Careful you don't cut yourself. You know, for a general, you fight like a wee girl. Like you always did. - I'm gonna cut you to pieces. (dramatic music) - Now you remember who I am, Liam? Hmm? I'm your nightmare, little Liam. I kicked your sick ass once, and now I'm gonna do it again. I cut up your orange little soccer ball, and now it's your turn, my friend. (grunting) Is that what you want as your leader? No, I'm your leader. I'm your leader. Now gather 'round, boys. (gun shooting) (dog whining) - I will not have anyone abusing an animal. No one, is that understood? Animals are God's gift to all of us. Beat it. - We've just received word that the US secretary of state will be attending a meeting, chaired by the British officials, before going on to a second private round of talks. So the question is, which place will they hit? The government talks or the meeting at the seaside house? After the US secretary's arrival, John will take half of our deployment to the government talks. I will lead the rest of the security team at the manner house, where our guest, Mr. Fallon, will be in charge of a security road block. - Only knows the secretary's time table. - Since the talks seem to be going well, the ETA of the second meeting should be about 90 minutes, over. - If you can convince him to do otherwise, it will be a smart move. Liam's coming here, John. I can feel it. (ominous music) - Jesus Christ. Get the first aid kit. - Easy does it, boys. We've got a ride to take. (laughing) - Can I give you a hand there, missus? - Oh, no problem. - Get in. Get in. Get in the house. Get down. Shut that kid up. Take the photo, go ahead, quick. (honking) - If that isn't a warm memory to cherish, I don't know what is. (laughing) (chattering) - Gerry, I think they're breaking up here. The US secretary just left. What's it like on your end, over. - [Gerry] If they're going to arrive, I think they would have already. Better come down here and buy us some supper. We've got company, son. (ominous music) - Shit. - Turn the engine off. IDs out and visible. And be quick about it. - What's all this about? We were told to provide catering for some visiting Americans. What's all the security hassle for? - Never you mind. - We're already late as it is. We don't need this hassle. - Yeah, OK. It's all right, Gerry. These caterers were expected 30 minutes ago. - Just a quick check in the back. - Gerry. They're screaming for the caterers inside. Everything's OK here. - He'd never be that obvious. - Sorry, mate. I got stuck in a ditch. (foreign language spoken) Come on, everyone, we're late. - So what do you think? - Don't think he's coming. Gerry. - 97, 98, 99, 100. Here I come, ready or not. Right here you little wanker. - Gerry, help me, help me. Help me. (laughing) - You little wanker. You always could find the best hiding places. - Damn. - What? - Damn. - Deal with the ones out there. Silencer. And then take care of the subtext. Go. - Hey, you're going the wrong way. (gun shooting) (grunting) - Those caterers who just came through, find 'em. They're the lads we want. (gun shooting) - Sit down, now. - What the hell is going on here? - Who are you people? What the hell do you want? - We, Mr. Secretary, are brothers in arms. And if our demands are met, these few hours we spend together will be pleasant ones. So just stay seated, shut up, and no heroics. (tense music) - [Man] In position. - We have the west side covered. - What do you think you're going to achieve, you bloody fool? You not know what you're going to destroy here. - I know exactly what I'm doing, you stupid bastard. I'm finishing your talks here with Mr. Loyalist over there. And you, Mr. Secretary. You can explain the US government's involvement in these secret peace talks when I invite the international media circus along. Look carefully, gentlemen. If anything happens to me, or if I am in any way made unhappy, I just have to push this button. And we'll all be traveling westward. To whom am I speaking? - Mr. Fallon, this is John Hall of US central intelligence. - Here's our demands, and I'll only say them once. First off, I want some members of the international media outside this compound within three hours. Or this little menage tois will be terminated. Second. I want some of my republican comrades freed from prison. Third. I want the British prime minister and the American president to issue statements about how they've just defied sanction deficit meetings between their government representatives, and men of violence. And finally. I'm requesting a liaison officer from your side to come over here. - Fine, I'd like to come in myself. - No, Mr. Hall, I don't want you, or the bastard. - The bastard. What bastard? - Me. - Are you sure you want to do this. - Want has got nothing to do with it. If this doesn't go in my favor, I want you to do something for me. When me buried me da, I put a rose in one pocket and a deck of cards in the other. That way, no matter which way he traveled, he'd be ready. I'd like to feel the same security. - Why didn't you take the shot when you had the chance? - When I was at Trinity College, I wrote my thesis on Shelly's Frankenstein, the doctor. The creator. When I do in Liam, it's gonna be my way. (ominous music) (knocking) - Leave us. - You've gotten better. - You've aged. Come, come, Gerry boy. No tears for this, old lad. - I don't suppose it'll do any good to ask you to surrender. - You taught me better than that, Gerry. - I never wanted this for you, Liam. I want you to answer your dreams. - And I just wanted to be like you, Gerry boy. (laughing) But then, I wanted to surpass ya. Which. I'd say I've done in flying colors. - You're a murderer. - And exactly what were you? - I thought I was a patriot. But I was just a stupid boy. - George Washington was considered a terrorist. And a murderer in his day. I'm winning, Gerry boy. They're on their knees. Join us. Be at my side again, Gerry, come on. - I don't think so, wee brother. I've committed enough sins for one lifetime. (tense music) - Insurance policy, Gerry boy. If those boys don't get a call from me every hour, well, you know what will happen. (ominous music) - What do you want me to do? - That's the spirit, Gerry boy. That's the spirit. This is an interesting gathering. All the rotten eggs in one basket. Gerry. It's all downhill from now, Gerry boy. - John. - Yeah, Gerry, this is John, go ahead. - They want a statement read by the British prime minister. And US president. No later than tomorrow at nine. They've got TV so he'll be watching. He says he'll release a hostage soon, as a sign of good faith. (laughing) - Boom. (laughing) Boom. (laughing) Get the hostage ready for me. - [Man] There's movement at the door. - I can take him now. - Hold your fire. - Mr. Hall, here comes your hostage. (laughing) They have no sense of humor, your employers. - If you don't release some humans, they'll not take us seriously. - You think Michael Collins and Walter Devril thought they'd live through their revolution? Huh, Gerry boy? - I need to take a piss, noble Mr. Martyr. - You're such an asshole, Gerry. Take him upstairs, will ya? And make sure he shakes twice and washes his hands. (ominous music) - I think I can get the one closest to us. Take on. (chattering) (tense music) - Have a crumpet. (grunting) (tense music) - Brian. It's Mary. What the fuck is Fallon doing in there? Erickson. I'm going in. (chattering) (gasping) (grunting) - Reports are coming in of gunfire from the holiday resort home of retired American general. (laughing) Full details are not yet available, but we do hope to have further coverage. - Daniel, where's your ma and pa? - At me sister's for the night. Just had a baby. - Daniel, we need your help. - Yeah, sure. - You lock down music, like the place, we need you to play live. OK? - Seriously cool, man. - John, can you hear me? - [Erickson] Erickson here, where are you? - Upstairs. I saw the main device on the top floor, managed to disconnect it. That means there's one more connected to all the charges downstairs. I think I know where It is. Where's John? - John is at the house. - Shit. - What do you want to hear? Festering Boys, the Flem Brothers, RE and the Puke. - Puke. - Brilliant. (rock music) - Don't people have no manners any longer? Why don't you take young Lucy upstairs and read her a bed? (chattering) - No, God damn it. (tense music) - Hey. (gun shooting) - It's Hall, CIA. (rock music) (chattering) - OK, boys, get ready. (yelling) - Sources say they believe that Liam Fallon, the leader of an extreme splinter group, going under the name Brothers in Arms, may be holding an American man hostage. Some of his men have already surrendered, and it is believed that their average age is only around 19. - What's this? - A spokesman for the security forces has informed reporters on the scene-- - You traitors. - [Reporter] As yet there has been no sighting of the leader, Liam Fallon, but they do expect the situation to be resolved in the next few hours. (gun shooting) - You traitorous bastards. - We got a clear shot. - Hold your fire. (gun shooting) (grunting) - You traitors. Gerry. Come on, Gerry, where you hiding, Gerry? Gerry. I'm gonna find you, Gerry. Come on, you wanker. - Bitch, I'll kill you. Get down here, Christ. (yelling) (rock music) (chattering) (gun shooting) - What the hell? (gun shooting) - Brilliant. - No. - What kept ya? - Modern technology. (beeping) (tense music) - What are you doing? They've all run away. Why? - Because you lost sight of the reasons for this. Your demands were exaggerations. And guess what? Because they were a bunch of stupid kids off the street, you dumb bastard. We worked on our people for months, years on end. Those kids had no training whatsoever. (gun shooting) Come on, Liam, come on, out the back, Liam, quick, hurry. - [Erickson] Erickson here, where are you? - Station two. The Fallons have left the area. - Take the house now. All units move in. Go, go, go. - Move it, move it, up by the window. - Come on. (chattering) (tense music) - [Liam] Come on, Gerry. (laughing) We did it. (chattering) - Search the perimeter. (beeping) - Gonna blow. (exploding) (coughing) - Great to be back together again, Gerry, you know? Great to have the family back together. - Aye. But sometimes. You got to take responsibility for what you've done. For what you created. Sometimes. Taking that responsibility means you have to let go of the things you hold dear. And the people you love. (dramatic music) - No. (exploding) - I can't say I understand why he did what he did. I'm sorry, Mary. Believe me, I know how it feels to lose someone you love. - It is a painful loss, Mr. Hall. Maybe that's something that you and I and Gerry have in common. He did what he did out of loyalty, to his family. His country. Might seem strange to you. It's what he was. I loved him for what he was. - Just in case, Gerry boy. Just in case. - [Gerry] Your life is mine. My life is yours. And life is what it's all about. And when we get what we deserve, life is hard to figure out. But things are always not the same. And who we are is not to blame. And if one day we end up dead, Mother, cover up my head. - For fuck's sake, Liam, you scared the piss out of me. - Sorry, Gerry, can I play with you, today? - Got no time for play anymore, Liam. Got to do something for Brian, for the movement. - You're going to make a bomb? - Yeah, but don't go shouting it about nowhere, either. - Can I help, I won't tell anyone. Please. - OK. Guess it's time you grew up. But don't tell anybody. - I won't. - OK. Come on. - [Gerry] Is it my fault, what I feel? Is it life I've got to steal? Tell me, softly, why I hate. Wake me up, before it's too late. Help my brother dry his tears. Help erase these last few years. If we could only take things back. And love the things that we attack. My brother's heart is thickly veiled. His heart is hard, his love has failed. But I am here to rescue him. And try to understand his whim. Are we here just to survive, and can we get through life alive? My baby brother's life is mine. My heart is his, it's now our time. (sentimental music)
