The Ups and Downs of a German-French Family in Munich 100 Years Ago THE SWING When on 6th June 1931 the news of the fire of Munich's Glass Palace rapidly spread throughout the world The same strange wish flashed through the heads of a few people: The house that bears the number seven and that is practically built onto the huge building in smoke and flames may burn down with it. These few people were brothers and sisters living far apart. The house, however, remained undamaged. Why it brought such unbearable recollections to the minds of those who spent their childhood there need not necessarily be mentioned. If we talk about this house, it is on account of the cheerfulness that triumphed there for many years. Oh my god, what's happening? Can't you be a bit more careful? Surely you can keep your eyes open! Oh my god. Did you get hurt? What's up? Have we drawn the winner? Was it Mathias? Yes, and Daddy fell on top of me ... smashing the Chinese vase, that ugly thing. Lautenschlag, you're a dreadful man. A dreadful person, a domestic tyrant, trying to save a little something, to slow down the family's bankruptcy and the high spirits and extravagance. What's the matter? Father put out the entrance lamps. Then Mathias stalked along ... and bumped into the open toilet door ... No, I walked into that huge oil painting. It's the drawing day in the lottery. Good morning, we've got a table for the Royal-Bavarian Landscape Director Lautenschlag. Yes, that's right, this is Lautenschlag. The insurance might pay a lot of money. What did you say? Why did father fall over you when the door was open, there was light? He's roomblind, he sees nothing but his trees and bushes. Let's go ... ... slowly, slowly. Mail or what? No, money, sir. But not here. Downstairs in the office. I've run out of housekeeping money, Max. Not in front of the people, Valerie. There was nobody in the office. Because Mr. Lautenschlag was apt to forgetting to invoice his gardening jobs, unexpected valuables would turn up around Christmas every year. Mr. Lautenschlag, fork out the housekeeping money. Don't play the fool, Mathias. I'm serious, Daddy. There was nobody in the office. - Yes, I know. I've got the number. What, is it a draw? Did you win? You won? That can't be true. No. Not yet, I mean to say that I've got the winning number. Have you won something? A losing number. Yes! Except for the last two numbers ... they're different. What a nuisance! Has somebody been at my wallet? Here, Maman, we've been robbing. This is the limit! I put my jacket down for 10 minutes ... There was nothing easier than an attack on Mr. Lautenschlag's wallet. If he noticed anything at all, he might have appeared to be angry, but he never thought to reclaim what had been stolen or to be more careful the next time. This absent-mindedness towards such a grim thing like money endowed him with immense charm in the eyes of the children. Now we invite Maman ... to the opera. But Hespera's going, too. Yes, Otto, ask her if she'd like to go. Go to the opera together. I'll get you a hansom cab. Lovely. Let's go. What about you? You ghastly creature? What shall we do with you? Wrap it up and give it away. Prof. von Zwingers house. Just a minute, please, madam. I shall tell the professor. Yes, I can hear you very well, madam. No wonder, madam, a result of the inquiring human mind. You can already talk as far as Potsdam. Don't mention it. Good night, Madam. Close your mouth, Anna. Did the instrument work, my dear? The telephone, yes. From the Lautenschlags. Magnificent! Rather drastic, don't you think? Maybe in the country ... I shall decide on that, Dorothea. Tobias. -Yes, Father. Mathematics? D, Father, ... sorry. Stand up straight! I shall reform, Father. Aren't you staying for tea, Fritz Emanuel? No. Sorry, my dear. I have to pay a visit to Mme Lautenschlag's mother. You look rather pale, Hedwig. I've just finished my rest-cure. Gertrud, Latin? A, Father. Physics? A, Father. Give me a kiss. Candida, German? C, Father, it was due to the subject ... You hang about the Lautenschlag's too often. Come to the hall, girls, we're going to have tea. How is the old lady? She's becoming more and more a burden to the Lautenschlags. Their household is permanently out of balance one way or another. I'll hold my evening lecture afterwards. Will you be back for dinner? It remains to be seen. Because Prof. von Zwinger, who was the family doctor of the Lautenschlags, never sent them a bill, Mme Lautenschlag showed her appreciation by giving piano lessons. Not so much pedal. Not so loud. Rhythmical! Rhythmical! You play like a cow trampling across the pasture. Sorry! Maman! Excuse-me, Maman. The court conductor has been waiting for three quarters of an hour. C sharp, please play C sharp. It's a C sharp. The widow of the Counsellor of the Consistory, Mrs. Erlendicht, a relation of the Zwingers, thought the service in return insufficient and proposed to poor Mme Lautenschlag to take her Klara and Irma on as pupils. Otto, have you seen my booklet? No, but I'll look for it. Good evening, my dear friend. How are you? -Good evening. Very well, thank you. I need my little French corner now. Bonsoir, Gervaise. How are you? Fine. Want a biscuit, Mathias? What will you get for Christmas? I asked my godmother for writing paper. Write ... boring! The motto printed on it should read: "Annoy people". You get a black nose for that. Have we got 'Föhn' today? I feel so dizzy. Have some tea, child. I'm going. Stay here, Hespera. Tell us about the old days. The old days. Yes, when our parents first came. Your mother always wanted to go home. Back to Paris. Then our Hespera came ... and then our heir to the throne here. And with you ... the war broke out. Stop it! Why must the Bavarians and the French go for each other? It's all Bismarck's fault. By God, if I were a man ... Never mind. I'll show them anyway. You've got a black nose. I have? You have! Why don't you bake in our kitchen? No. I'm retired. The candles, be careful. Nothing will happen, Maman. It's Christmas, Grandmother, it's Christmas. Otto, could you please help me? Oh, it's a lot! What's this? What a nice picture. Your mother, and Mathias in trousers. Gervaise, the candles! Don't worry, Maman, nothing can happen. You carry on. What's the matter? I don't know. Life makes no sense. Merry Christmas. Shall we share this doughnut? Doughnut? How long have you been in Munich? They're called "Faschingskrapfen". What are Moor's heads? Indianerkrapfen. -Indianerkrapfen. What's a Karfiol? -A cauliflower. And a Stranitzn? -A paper bag. Well done. Mathias, come, we should go home. Come on, let's go up now we're here. Do you really like Luther? Maybe not as much as I should. We wouldn't have stayed behind even without you Protestants. You haven't got one nice church. And you messed up the ones you took away from us. I prefer yours, too. This is the head. Come and sit on the soft cushion. Makes me feel creepy. Are you going to the theatre? Have you got a ticket? Not yet. I might be invited. By the pale assessor? Maybe ... do you like the look of him? Do you? No, not really. Neither do I. We gave him a nickname too: Beer-soup. My heart! Why make me come up here? From a Royal Highness. Show me your junk. I'll have the skates. How much? They cost five marks. When they were new. I'll give you 1.50 marks. The necklace? Nothing. You can keep it. Thank goodness. What do you need the money for? Theatre tickets and clothes. What theatre? Duse's coming. Eleonora Duse! The great actress. You won't understand her. Are the tickets so expensive? Terribly expensive. It can't be helped. What else? This album. Fifty Pfennigs. Winter, you say. Three marks. Overshoes! Lined! Two. Christening fork and spoon. You're crazy! I could give you six marks. Ten. All right then, seven. That all? No more. Fourteen marks. It still isn't enough. So, guys. Goodbye. King Ludwig ... The Second? From one of his lackeys. How much do you want? Twenty marks. Impossible. So, goodbye. Stop! Ten. Twenty. Fifteen. Twenty. Eighteen. Twenty. Stop! My headgear. Stop, will you! Look back there! Good day, Gervaise. Good day, Mr. von Ried-Recours. Is everything well at home? Good day, Gervaise. First starring-tour of Eleonora Duse with her body of artists. Come. Expensive. The Lautenschlags. Every one of them. Ours wait nicely until the critique appears. Can't pay their bills but buy first-night tickets. Let's run upstairs. I like to see it from the top when it's empty. What a busy day! Let's look at the pictures. She's beautiful. Here she's even more beautiful. Armando! - My beloved! Good day, Gervaise! Good day, Mr. von Ried-Recours. Is everybody well at home? Good day, Gervaise. Good old colonel von Ried-Recours. Well done, Gervaise. Were the Zwingers there, too? I'm sure pudding face didn't allow them. I see ... and you? What ... us? Who allowed you? In our family everybody acts on his own responsibility. That isn't bad. That isn't bad, Mathias. I must go down to the office. Goodbye, girls. Don't disturb Maman. A publisher in Paris sent her a letter. He wants to print some of her songs. Boy, we'll become rich! With that money ... No, Otto, not with a few songs ... Finished! You cheated! -No, I didn't cheat! Yes, we're quits. He's a cheater. I'm tired. Stay, Hespera. It's nothing without you. I'll put it in the tour-box. I'll get the centenary calendar to find out when it's full moon in July. Yes, and what the weather's going to be like. I'll fetch it. Do you know how late it is? Three o'clock in the morning. Gartenmarie, we're hungry. I'll get you something. Full moon ... is on 19th July. The weather? The weather! You always make others work. Good. At least for four weeks. Boy, oh I can hardly stand it. I can hardly wait. She's going nuts. My girl... Coming with me? Just a minute. Don't I ... have to worry about you ... my girl? I don't ... know anything about you anymore. I'm fine, Daddy. That's good. Will you ... be leaving soon? When? Good morning, Mr. Lautenschlag. -Good morning. Good morning, Miss. You're the first. You know, Hespera ... the impatience ... I just can't stay at home ... forever out ... the rockgardening horticultural society opening of a show ... the tulips ... the rhododendrons ... it's always when I'm away ... that I'd like to be at home with you ... I think ... I'm a ... bad father ... No. It's because all six of us have to be free. Maman. She has her music ... but Gervaise ... I can't ... She might go to the theatre. Otto ... He's just lazy. He'll fall through his A-level leaving examination. He won't. And Mathias. Mathias is cheeky, that's all. Look, Sir, you're in the newspaper. Big flower show in the Glass Palace in Munich. Tomorrow, 10th May, at ten o'clock, ceremonious opening. Prince Regent Luitpold. The designer of the show Lautenschlag ... Royal Bavarian Landscape Gardener. Here we go. It's tapped! Postcards! Hurrah, Prince Alfons! A reckless devil, proper reckless! Bravo ! There he is. Where is he? There. Maman, to the left of the entrance. Forever that shabby coat. Have you seen him, Grandmother? Maman! Maman, no! Do you need us, Maman? No, it's alright. It's nothing. Maman! Come downstairs with us. It will take your mind off things. There's hardly anybody there now. It'll do you good. I had a look at it. Daddy's done a very good job of it. Alright. let's go. Madam, young man and young ladies, we're closing in half an hour. Good evening, madam. How are you, Mrs. von Zwinger? How do you do, my dear Mrs. Lautenschlag? Superb, unparalleled! A real master of his trade, your husband. The simplicity! It looks as if it hardly cost anything. If I'd been given the job, it would look much more magnificent, but it'd be much more costly, too ... The blockhead, cultural lowbrow! Come, Candida, I'll show you something. Excuse-me, madam. My dear doctor. Can you spare me a minute? We have a little problem with my maman. Madam, may I introduce you to my daughters? This is Gertrud, this Hedwig. These are my sons: Tobias and Victor. Tobby, come with me! That little snake! I'm doing my cycling test. It is sensa ... tional. I want to pass my cycling licence. You ought to do the same. I'll learn to ride on one wheel and to do clever tricks. You can perform in the street, just like that. And I'll collect the money. If we do it eight times a month we can make at least ... What's the matter? Have you done your Latin? Now don't you start with that rubbish as well. Lucifer! -What? What did you say? Nothing, brother, nothing. He does it nicely, the conductor, not bad. Why do you talk so condescendingly? Because I understand something about it. I got this from Maman. Do you know what I'd like to become? A pianist? No! A conductor! But that's a man's occupation. Did Luther say conductor was a man's occupation or the Lord personally? You think the baton's too heavy? Men's occupation! Women's occupation! Old-fashioned rubbish! Stop! Stop! Ladies and gentlemen, you ought to know the rules of getting off by now. Wait a minute, Miss. It's caught here. Thank you. Good day, I'm late. Good day, Mr. von Zwinger, we can see that. Please join the group. Tobby, how fantastic! I didn't know you were coming. Is Gervaise here, too? What makes you think that? Today I'd like to make you familiar with the situation should you be confronted with an oncoming motorcar. Is this your cycle? Yes. Nice for you. We have a tea on Thursday. I could invite you. I can't come. Today I'd like to make you familiar with the situation should you be confronted with an oncoming motorcar. In such a case it is especially important that ... Come on, we have to clear the crossing! Don't look so daft, you foolish townsman! What a luxury! Who's paying for it all? The light's on again in the parlour. The papal Uditore has accepted, Daddy, and the French ambassador, and if we're lucky the abdicated Queen will come, too ... Stop that, how disgusting! Mathias is the snob of the family. She needn't tell everybody to his face. You aren't everybody. Hot, isn't it? No! Otto, what about your Latin? No homework. He'll remain stupid. Nothing for you. Ninny! You'll stay behind like last year. I don't care. You'll end up selling matches. Filthy beast! You can't even talk Bavarian properly. Bastard, you yourself! -What's happening? You'll never find a husband. Why must the Germans be so coarse? I've ordered the flowers for tomorrow. Max, we need some more money. The small expenses are killing us. Pardon, my dear? The small expenses are ruining us. The air is so good. Yes, Maman, it's spring time. I've brought you a few lilia longiflora. Are you well? Yes, very well, my darling. Boy, am I worked up! Still mad at me? Why do you ask? Give me your hand! I'm sharing out the chestnuts. I bought them with my money. Boy, am I worked up! Come, help me! Mind the corners. Is Candida coming? Later maybe. They're giving another of these charity teas. The fifth this month. They don't know where to put the money. With hard sausages that long! And meat pastes that thick! And kilo tons of jam on the table. With potential sons-in-law. Munich's businessmen. All kept well in check ... to be mixed with the Prussians. -Mathias, that's enough! And with the widow Erlendicht and her loathsome talk as sweet as sugar. That's enough! Stop it! That's enough work for today, Kreszenz. You'll degrade me to slave owner if you continue working like that. We can't leave the furniture outside all night. Joseph, will you help Kreszenz carry the furniture inside, and that'll be it. Mr. Lautenschlag, I've got something for you. For me? I got you there, dear friend! The child within you likes presents. It isn't really the presents ... No? Wait ... It's only the moment ... when the heart beats ... when the swing goes up. Is that it? Could be. This is for Mathias. Greetings from her mother's native town Paris. For cheeky Mathias? She isn't cheeky. She's one who already makes you feel she can find her way through life alone. What you've made out of this plot of town ... But what about your tea? Isn't there a big soiree at your house tonight? They've advanced it to now ... And you've got out of the way again ... No, you're no man for society. Why in the afternoon? Because a young singer is to be patronized today ... she's going to sing ... and the chief conductor of the court can only come in the afternoon. You should have seen how excited Mathias was. They're accumulating. The coaches are accumulating outside our house. No mistake. The abdicated Queen. She's coming by foot. One coach less. It is long since the painter was here last. They still heat with wood. State woods ... of course ... as an official. I see ... an official ... fancy my master coming here ... Mr. Lautenschlag did the flower show. I thought the gardeners did it. You know what - he arranged everything. He is something special. The hall is something special, too. ...especially narrow-chested. Would you like a gentian schnaps? I take the liberty. It has the colour of your eyes. And all rooms in your house have beautiful colours. It's wonderful. -It's my husband who ... He's a great artist in his kind of work. I'll visit the exhibition, of course. It was very interesting. He has always had very special plants. -Yes, I know. Would you mind bringing me a cake fork, my dear? I'm sorry, ma'am. Why not, my dear? We haven't got any, ma'am. And that's me. That's you? How sweet. That's interesting. I think there are some tensions between Germany and Italy. Gervaise. please. This is Miss Gervaise Lautenschlag. His Royal Highness, Prince Carl Alexander von Brandenburg. Nice to meet you, Your Royal Highness. Prince Alexander is a music expert. He's at the Royal Opera nearly every day. Especially when Danzi sings. Have you seen her as Fiordiligi? Yes, with the divine Strohberger. I find him too effeminate. Excuse-me, I have my duty to do. The little singer hasn't had one yet ... Habermann isn't going to get one. I mustn't have any sweets now ... it's bad for the voice. I'll ask Maman if you can begin. No, not yet, please. May I introduce you to Mr. von Habermann? Habermann! The artist? I'm pleased to meet you ... please take a seat ... I love your portraits. I'm glad of that. We are the last ones. The photographers are the new portraitists. Photography's not an art, it only shows the outside. Its banal. Art, I mean real art, is only just beginning. Artists ought to paint more in the abstract. Mr. von Habermann knows more about that than you, Mathias. Where do these people get their reputation from? They really don't offer anything, the wallpaper's covered with soot. The cheeky brat - on the other hand the exquisite guests. The answer is ... Munich, my dear. The Föhn maybe. Munich has different rules. The social differences, it's different to up North, where you come from. Do you know why Ibsen came to Munich and was reluctant to leave? No, sir. Because he was closer to Italy and because he, I quote: "had the convenience to live among Catholics, who in Germany are to be given preference over the Protestants" I keep hearing about this Föhn. -I've never noticed it. It must be a fairy tale. Stay here for a few years, my friend, then you'll know what Föhn is. If I miscount when conducting there's no Föhn, but if my kettle-drummer miscounts there's Föhn. Föhn is simply a quickly warmed wind that blows down from the Alps. that dazes people's brains, and the characteristics of which are that people don't get used to it but keep suffering more and more by it. Without the prelude, please. I don't want to ... I just wanted to draw your attention ... to a sport of nature ... Wonderful! The sunset! It looks as if it were burning. It can't burn, my dear. The monster will be preserved to Munich for ever. It's only made of glass and metal. Disgusting! We missed you, Candida ... And anyway, you'd have had enough to eat at home. I'm not hungry. Who was there to admire? The court conductor and the artist Habermann. Careful, child, he's a Socialist. Like that Leibl. Or that terrible Frenchman, that Millet. Art should glorify things. We don't need these people to tell us that life can be hard. I was behind the kitchen door with my gentian. It is long since the painter was here last. They still heat with wood. State wood ... of course, as an official. I see ... an official ... fancy my master coming here ... Would you like a gentian schnaps? I take the liberty. You should have seen Mathias, Daddy, The court conductor was sitting here ... and she feeds him ... like a seal pup. Mme Contenay also wanted a chestnut. Hop. Mathias did her pirouette. My small French circle did me a lot of good once again. Your beautiful flowers. Otto has a hole in his sock. I'll have the biggest hole. Who'll join in? Smaller! Mathias? Smaller! Bigger! You've won! What's ruined is ruined. Nothing's mended. Do you know what time it is? It's nearly four o'clock. I'm afraid ... afraid of Hespera's and Gervais' future. Above all ... they must be free, the girls. You Germans aren't free. Especially not women. Especially not the girls. You are subjects. What have I become? A pianist? No. A "housewife in God's anger". Valerie, I ... Yes, I know, I was just joking. But it is true. Another of Zwinger's daughters is getting married tomorrow. Let them get married ... the rich people among themselves ... and lead their boring life. Be quiet! What's the matter, sister? Maman ... a knife ... a man stuck a knife ... in Maman's back ... horrible! I must be off to school. Daddy, say something. What? I've asked you ten times already! What? There's no point in a bicycle licence without a bicycle. The others have one. Stop that begging! He always just slips away. You're only here on sufferance. You're a bad father. Valerie. Excuse-me ... something ought to be done ... about your mother. Please, I'm doing my work. I'm not asking you to mend our socks ... this concerns your mother. I heard what you said. M. Lhombre will be leaving soon. That man's singing... Witwatersrand, that's where they found the richest gold deposits in the world. But the Boers won't let anyone or I'd have gone there long ago. After school, or even before that. There you become rich in a flash. Where is that? Witwatersrand? Transvaal! Where's Transvaal? In South Africa. There's as much gold there as pebbles on the Isar. The catfish was excellent. I'm looking forward to the sweet. What is it? Valerie ... but why now? Because this is necessary. Because there has to be a vegetable. But this is an insult to the eye ... Take it away! Every suckling knows where Transvaal is. Are you laughing about me? Take it away! Daddy! Fourteen gold coins. Thank you very much, Daddy. That's all of 240 marks. Thank you so much, Daddy! Thank you! I'm beside myself ... I'm beside myself with joy ... My God, professor, did you hurt yourself? That remains to be seen. Why was the light put out? Max, did you put the light out again? Good evening, Professor von Zwinger. I nearly killed myself just now. My bicycle's a real dream, I tell you. Good day. Your mother can't possibly stay here. I can't vouch for anything anymore. I'll help you hand her over to a "sanatorium" in France. Will you stay with us for dinner, my dear friend? No, thank you. I'm going to the opera. Thank you very much. Good night, Madam. Sorry. Maybe next time? Goodbye. Goodbye. Good evening, Miss. Good evening, Sir. Goodbye. Goodbye, Sir. That I've got this cycle, that I've got this cycle ... Stop talking about that damn thing! It's so nice, the cycle. I must go to the horticultural society. There's a strange smell ... My lamp! I see, all antiques belonging to the family. Here I have the list ... what if I said ... fifty marks ... What, only fifty marks? But inspector, Sir, five times as much ... this Dutch painting alone ... and the baroque lamp ... and the Persian tapestry ... which is beyond recognition. All right then, I'll apply for 200 marks and we'll see whether it's accepted. It's at least something. I wonder if Zwinger's country house is as pompous as the one in town? You mustn't abuse when we're invited. David! Hello, David! Where's Hespera? -In Meran. With friends. And Otto? Has to swot for his exams. Look, Vicky and Candida. Hey, Mathias, look! How fantastic! Can we have a ride in it, too? Yes, but the horse has to pull it uphill. Tonight, if you like. Where's Hespera? -In Meran. With friends. And Otto? Has to swot for his exams. Come, Leonhard, harness up! Was this your idea? The trucks belong to our peat industry. Oh, you have a peat-cutting? You're so soft. You like that, eh? Come, Vicky, give us a hand. Splendid! The variety of forms in nature! They need to be supported. Ah, the Misses Lautenschlag. Good day, Mathias. Good day, Professor. Good day, Gervaise How is your grandmother? Maman's taking her home to France next week, to a ... A good decision. What a beautiful day today. Good day, Gervaise. Good day, Mrs. von Zwinger. Good day, Mathias. And your father? In the best of health as usual? He's fine. He's fine, my dear ... Well then, enjoy yourselves. We're having blue cabbage. Red cole. Sorry, Father. God's blessing on Bavaria. It is pleasant living here. There are certainly more intelligent races, but none as full of life. If you put your trust in the powerful leadership of our Chancellor in Berlin, you are in Abraham's bosom. I like to eat a piece of the ears. What if they make a mistake in Berlin? That is beyond your judgment. Did you have a nice tour? Yes, very nice ... Tobby, he's fantastic! How he can drive four-in-hand! Like the Romans! He could compete for a championship ... or go to the circus. That might be worth striving for for you, Mathias. but a von Zwinger doesn't go to the circus. Bismarck resigned his office yesterday. What did you say? Well, he could have. That's no joking matter. I now lift my glass to drink to the health of my daughter Hedwig and Mr. Max Süssmeier who have got engaged today. Read out! If a girl is rich enough, she'll find a husband soon enough ... Tobby, faster, Tobby! Can you imagine our father and the professor ... being related? Daddy and pudding face? I can't. You can't, can you? Neither can I. 97 marks for Hespera's room. I hope the money comes before our long holidays. My nut aches! Has Hespera written? No. I'm off. Homework? Mind your own business. Otto, homework, reading! I hate reading! Especially when Hespera isn't here. I'm looking for my booklet again. When's Maman coming? I don't know. Grandmère isn't at all well. My nut aches terribly. Soup, soup, soup! There's some onion soup for you, too, Mathias. What's the matter? Don't you want any soup? It's no good without Hespera. It's the Föhn. Come and have your soup. I'm invited to Baroness James' foal and filly dance. I've nothing to wear. We'll find something. I'm not going apishly. Ah, my friend! Good evening, Mathias! My dear colonel, may I introduce you to Candida von Zwinger? Colonel von Ried-Recours. Good evening, Gervaise. Good evening, Mr. von Ried-Recours -Good evening, sir. Good evening. Pretty! No, I'm sorry ... not apish ... but not dull, either. Exactly! Enjoy yourselves. Listen, dear, this is Strauss' latest waltz. The Emperor's Waltz. Listen, the prelude is very special. The foal and filly dances are always nice, aren't they? Yes, it wouldn't be June without my foal and filly dance. What whim have the youngsters got this year? This year it's the envelopes. Wally, please show us your envelopes. Charming, aren't they? And what do they do with them? For love letters, aren't they? No, for nothing. For nothing? You collect them, don't you? And the more you have ... ... the better. And the clothes. What's new? There are two camps now. The well-behaved and the oppositionists. Look at Mathias, she's the opposition "not apish, but not dull neither." What's got into her? A third envelope! Mathias, stop that now! What's the matter, Mathias? Haven't you been asked to dance? I don't want to? The two Masters von Zwinger. Tobias, would you like to dance with Mathias? With pleasure. I'm sorry, I promised Stephanie von Malaisé the first dance. I'm sure you don't mind. What did she mean with the envelope? I can't tell you. It's a secret. But the waltz is no longer a fashion, isn't it? We've had it ever since I can remember. Where's Otto? He's swotting for his exams. Didn't you dance? You're boring, Mathias. I talked to the Baroness. Who is she? My friend. Yes, but ... She's very, very clever. And she knows the whole world. She doesn't accept invitations. No wonder, with our rigid etiquette. Where would you place her at a table ... A Jewess ... who was married to an American? Mr. James, who bought her a barony at a heavy cost. But she ... she only wanted to be a Baroness to be equal with colonel von Roed-Recours. But I don't think he loves her. I hate stories that haven't a happy end. Where's my damn handkerchief? I've found out about the third envelope. Mathias and the young von Zwinger girl ... Candida? yes, and Candida bet ... that she, that Mathias could tell a Protestant from the others without knowing anything about him, you see? And every time she's right ... Mathias gets an envelope. And every time she's wrong ... Candida gets an envelope. I don't know how you guessed, dear friend ... A fourth envelope! Valerie? -Yes. Valerie! Be quiet, my dear. I'm making some music. Please! Valerie, come here, please. Is this ... the bill for the mourning clothes? Yes, of course, my dear. Do you know that it will ruin us? No ... is it a lot? I haven't seen it yet. A lot? It costs more than a public garden. I asked you. When did you ask me? And you didn't listen once again. I did listen. I said: It's your mother, I'll leave it to your tact ... that we don't make fools of ourselves. With our old rags we would have made fools of ourselves. But that doesn't mean all of us have to have brand-new mourning clothes made. What did you have in mind then? Have in mind ... nothing! This isn't my affair. It's not your affair? We're married after all! Married! I beg you! The children! At least Mathias could have worn a black thing ... a crape on her jacket to go to school with. I'm sorry, Valerie ... I didn't want to hurt ... When will Maman be buried? She's already been buried. Already buried? Has already been buried? Daddy, please! Why this circus then? Daddy! Maman's mourning is a cirque? Yes, circus! Why this circus that will ruin us, get us put in prison? Because this is necessary. It is necessary? Like your cauliflower? It is just done. When will we need the rags that are ruining us? When, on what occasion? Valerie? When? On what occasion? Valerie? Tell me! I don't know. Valerie! I don't know! Papa! I've passed my leaving examination! Otto! Congratulations! I'm so glad! Valerie, my darling! How long are you going to stay in the countryside? Only three weeks. Maybe we'll meet at Tegernsee. Yes. Goodbye, my dear friend. See you soon at Tegernsee. I would like to say goodbye to Gervaise. I wanted to say goodbye. Do you really want to join in on this folly? We've been looking forward to it all winter. Every spare ten pfennig piece goes in the tour-box. A young girl ... climbing around in the mountains at night! It's full moon. We're going according to the calendar. Full moon ... I'd know something better ... Don't be angry. It might be the last time. Who knows how much longer Hespera will be with us ... Gervaise, got me a sharpener? No! Farewell, Miss. Hespera! Otto, Maman, Gervaise! Hespera's back! Why didn't you let us know so we could fetch you? Maman! Hespera, the insurance ... Nice to have you back, my girl. The insurance wants to pay 97 marks for the fire. Tomorrow we're going to Lenggries. We've found a comfortable little house. Let me take your bag. My girl, you look weak. I am. Wasn't it nice? They keep arguing. Your friends? The engaged couple? I kept having to mediate. Why are they getting married, then? That's what you went away for for three months? Aren't you going on holiday, Daddy? No, I'll have a nice time here with Gartenmarie. Outside the heat ... and us two in here ... not speaking a word ... everything's quiet ... except for a little clattering now and again, when she gets my soup ready ... Then we'll go to the Blauberge ... and then the Valepp ... Otto, be careful! This madness every year. Otto, have you seen my mantilla? What? My shawl. No, I haven't got it. Gervaise, please bring my me my mantilla. Here's your watch, do you want it? Yes! Bring it down. With those summer shoes? Our climbing boots are in the rucksack. We're very well equipped, Maman. I don't understand you. It's easy. You go over the mountains and there's Tegernsee. We might see you there. M. Lhombre might call later on, don't you want to wait for him? M. Lhombre only comes for the music. It's nice to have you back. For the last half hour maybe I had a phase whereby I found it hard to walk, and now all of a sudden, it's easy, very easy. Like ... like in heaven! Yes, like in heaven. What time is it? A quarter to three. It'll soon be light. What time is it? Nearly five in the afternoon. Let's sleep another hour. Gosh, just everything seems ordinary, if compared to the nights! We'll have a nap when we get there and then breakfast at Mrs. James'. Can you pass me the fish? The eggs are so fresh. Shall I have one, too? Yes, sure. Do you know what's happened? We're only allowed to use the new stamp with the Prince Regent's head. But artists have protested because the old one with the Bavarian coat of arms is much nicer. Those are the worries of Bavaria. Come with me, Hespera. Lhombre is here ... he's staying at the Villa Schorl ... Gervaise should beware of Lhombre. He hates women. There have already been some victims. His revenge ... for a deep wound ... when he was young ... But why am I telling you this ... take care of Gervaise ... And you? Yes? Do you ever think about yourself? Your journey ... ... was for friends ... They needed someone to mediate? Yes. It was the same as at home then ... No, at home ... there are us four. And our parents. Think about yourself for once. Maybe I do only think about myself. The moon walks ... are for me alone! Oh, look at this lovely crew there. Do you know who they are? Yes, I know them. Some girls from Munich. Suddenly Mrs. James gave me a peculiar look and said: "You'd have the stuff for an author." But if I wrote, I said, they'd always have to come together. There'd always have to be a happy end. And ... always the Bavarians and the French. No ... I'll write against war! That the French and the Bavarians never wage war against each other again. It isn't here either. What a nuisance! What a pity! I'm sorry ... I might have lost the purse in the shed. I'll have a look. That's much too far. I don't mind. I have such a queer feeling ... I don't really like life ... We're all hanging in the air. I think I'm just waiting. I'm waiting to go to a mental home like Grandmère. Mathias! Don't go. I must sometime ... What? But not now. Imagine what it'd be like in the house if you went and I had to stay. I'm not going ... Then don't say such wretched things. I've got it. It was in the shed. You'll be made diamond king. Zugspitz! Alpspitz! Dreitorspitz! That's Tegernseer Hütte. That's Dreitorspitz over there. What remains to be said? L'hombre soon cleared off without a word. and Gervaise married into a middle-class family. Otto remained on the materialistic side of life. And Hespera? She died of influenza the following winter. Stop! We've forgotten Mathias. She became an author of course. She became Annette Kolb, the courageous fighter for peace between her two home countries, who depicted the house of her childhood when the news of the fire of the Glass Palace reached her. THE SWING
