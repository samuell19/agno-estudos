JO MIN-SOO KIM EUN-YOUNG Kitty, breakfast! So tired. 89.3 dollars, please. Bitch! I'll tear her head right off once I get my hands on her. - Thank you. - Keep the change. Thank you. Shit! Goddammit. Why, you shithead! What's your problem? Even my own mother never laid a hand on me. First, you should say "I'm sorry," you little shit! Hey! Get back here! 3301, I have it memorized. I'll catch you. You're dead! That bastard scared me. That little shithead will pay. 3301... ♪ ...I can't get pushed around ♪ ♪ I'm me, you're you ♪ ♪ It ain't complicated ♪ With her baby sister at home, is she nuts? Jeong Sun-deok! Hey! What is this idiot babbling about? You'd better step aside. I'll count to three. One, two. You bastard, one, two, three! - Get your... - The hell? You bring a man home when your sister is... 265-558 Unit 401, Bogwang-dong, Yongsan-gu, Seoul Oh, it's 401. Damn that 3301 biker. I'm sorry. Put something on. You'll catch a cold. I'm sorry, she's... It's okay. The hell... When did she run off? - A year ago. - A year ago? Unbelievable! And you never told me? Yuri's still in high school! Is this why you ignored my calls? You said... Shit, it's goddamn noisy. You said you'd look after her. You said I'd never set a good example. And you just let her take off? Did you kick her out so you can make music? Fine, so it happened. - You should've at least told me. - Excuse me, but you realize that we aren't close, do you? And I started on my own in middle school. That's because you couldn't stand living with me and just ran off. Why show up all of a sudden and make a fuss? - You're overreacting. - Never mind. We must find Yuri. 3,000 dollars. She took off with the shop's deposit. Nonsense. Yuri did what? Get ready. We're going out. Not today. I got a recording and a show. I'll get evicted if I don't pay by tomorrow. What will you do? Find her. She's in a small studio, isn't she? Why should I? - Hey! - What? I'll give you the address. How will I find it myself? You found this place. Why are you so selfish? - I got it from my mother. - Why you! Just get ready. Or will you lend me that money? I knew something was off when she came over to the store a couple of days ago. What the hell? Yours, too? JAZZY MISFITS Did you two agree to piss me off? You two are so much alike. I expected more from Yuri. My mom was in my dream last night. It felt uneasy. Oh, no. The soup place has shut down. I liked their beef chunks. I guess the Mijungs are gone, too. Well... Is this the show tonight? Check out those eyes. What's with the name "Blue"? Better than Sun-deok. What about it? I paid the shaman 200 dollars for that name. You're drunk. Back then, that money could buy you a lot of booze. Don't call me Sun-deok out here. And you don't call me Mom. Hello? Hey, can you get Hong or Jackey to replace me for tonight's show? Oh, I see. Nah, that's fine. Let's file a report first. What report? What will be better? A missing person's report? Or theft? You're unbelievable. Where do you get these ideas? Straight out of my ass. How about that? Wonder if it's still there. I was a regular. Okay. We understand what you're saying. Then you should go find her. Why are you still here? We get that. But there's a procedure... What? Would you do the same if it was your own kid missing? If something happens to my daughter... I was born and raised in this area, got that? Yes, ma'am. You're her daughter, right? I'm done with you pricks. Who's the boss here? "Boss"... You can talk to me. Who is it? What now? - You... - Chun-bae? Here. Thank God Sun-deok knows this neighborhood well. She wants to be called Blue. Oh, right. Blue. That's fine. Whatever suits you. Do you remember me? When you were little, I helped your family move and bought you snacks. I think I do... Maybe. It could be that I saw you on the streets. I'm not sure. You moved before Sun-deok, I mean... It's "Blue," right... You moved before Blue went to elementary school, right? Right. I was so worried when you left abruptly. It's good to see you doing well. And don't worry about Yuri. I'm sure she's fine. I'll call nearby stations for backup. You first check her studio and her school. Thank you, Chun-bae. This is so hard to believe. What do you mean? That the legendary "Sleeveless" Go Chun-bae is in a police uniform. The boss, at that! The real legend was your mom. Her nickname was... Itaewon Diamond. And she hasn't changed a bit. A diamond, indeed. More like a Swarovski now. Oh... Swirl of... Ski? I'm sorry, Chun-bae. Back then... I knew you had feelings for me... It was too obvious. One day, I heard someone singing, so I looked back. But there was nothing. Nothing in sight but your mom. I was completely bewitched. Sir? There's been an assault in the redevelopment area in Bogwang-dong. They're presumed to be teenagers. Yeah? We'll be right back. It was a prank call. A prank, are you kidding me? We get these a lot. Better than having a serious assault. That freaked me out. I swear I'll teach that girl a lesson. Thank you, Chun-bae. No sweat. Need a ride to Yuri's studio? Really? But it's in the opposite direction. But I won't say no. So reliable. - Let's go. - Come. Careful, it's so slippery. - I'm slipping. - Careful. My goodness. It's all downhill from here. Can I ask you guys a question? What are you looking for? I'm trying to find my guesthouse. The guesthouse. Show me! Yeah. It's here. Chun-bae, isn't this close to your station? Right, it is. Oh, okay. Go straight. Three minutes. Right. - Right? - It won't be easy to find it. It's far, very far. Ah, it's far? Okay. You know what, why don't you give him a ride instead? We can find our own way. You sure? Alright, then. You. Follow. Korea policeman. He's a captain. Wow, captain. Okay, cool. You, get off. I'm sorry, Sun-deok. - Thanks, guys. So nice. - In, in. - Careful. Have a good trip! - Thank you. Don't be too concerned. I'll keep looking into it. I'm so glad I ran into you. Take care of your mother. Alright. See you later. Sure. Bye! Thanks! See you. This is so frustrating. You're so nosy. Of course, I should be. People must help one another. I think she smokes and cries in her room by herself. She has friends over sometimes, and I think she drinks too. My Yuri isn't that kind of girl. Sure, of course not. She often comes in late but never spent the night out before. Two nights at that. I was getting worried, actually... But seeing you is making me more worried. But are you really her family? Yes, why? Well, you're just so different. Like what? Just... The vibe. What do you mean? I mean, Yuri is calm and ladylike. What are you saying, you little shit! See? Different. Must all family members be alike? Never mind that. So, we can't see her room? Nobody can. Not even the President. Call me when she gets back, and don't mention us. Do your job properly. Are you really the manager of this place? You don't seem smart enough to manage this place. Quit it. What do you mean by "ladylike"? Let's go our own ways if you'll keep acting this way. So immature. Dumbass! You got her upset! I've been a teacher for a while, and I can tell when the kids fake it. But Yuri actually looked ill. Yuri's ranked third in her class, and she's been maintaining her grades well, so I doubt she's skipping school intentionally. Get back inside! I'm sorry, I couldn't hold my temper. By the way, I was told that her mother lives abroad. So I didn't know who else to call. Me? Abroad? Yes, she's temporarily in America for work. She told me she's in England. She said you're a singer in England. Yes, she goes back and forth. Isn't that right? I knew it the moment you walked in. Your fabulous attire and all. But you aren't Yuri's real sister, are you? I heard that she's an only child. That's right. I'm just a close friend of hers. I see. A friend. Look at me, smoking next to a famous British singer. Bitch. How could she lie about me? At least you're living abroad. I don't even exist. Yet I supported that wench for three years. Well, that's because your family register is under your dad's name. Ranked third in her class, huh? Smart little bitch. Probably got it from her dad. Whatever. She's one dead bitch! Are you even worried about her? Worrying won't change anything. If I was the kind that worried over a few days of her missing, I would've already dropped dead because of you. You used to run off more often than you ate, you know? Did you even feed me? Hey! What's with the attitude? Our ancestors' words are all true. There's no use sacrificing for your children. Huh? Well, well... Hey, you! - Huh? - Get over here. Come on. What grade? Senior year. Do you know Jeong Yuri? Yes, she was in my class last year. Is that so? Great! Where is she now? - Pardon? - I'm her sister. And I'm her mother. - Oh, hello. - Anyway, Yuri's been absent from school, and no one knows where she is. Do you know anyone she's close with? I'm not really friends with her. Me neither. Why not? Are you being mean to her? No, Yuri's neither a loser nor a bully. Nothing like that. - She's always very quiet. - She's a quiet girl. If anything significant, she loves K-pop bands. - Remember that time? - Yeah! She jumped up and started dancing to K-pop. - Out of the blue. - It was Mamamoo. - Yuri dances? - Really? She got that from me. She must have some close friends. I don't know who she hangs out with. Well, who sits next to her in class? I really don't know. Are you guys on social media? - Yes. - Let me see. Click that photo. This one? The bitch got a tattoo? Looks like it. Give it to me. Right. I heard she works part-time at a tattoo salon. She studies, dances, and gets tattoos... It feels like we're detectives, right? Whatever. I'm sure the owner of this shop is the culprit. Decent people never hire a minor without the parent's consent. I worked since middle school. Exactly! She learned it from you. Yuri grew up watching her sister work part-time, and that made her want to do part-time jobs herself. Which is why she went looking for one. Then the bastard here with the tattoo... You're going to wait here? I've got to go. I'll come with you. I can't wait here for two hours. Come where? You got a show. Just go find a cafe. Why? It's my work. Why would you tag along? You're going to sing. Let's see how well you perform. There's nothing to see, and you never liked me singing. Because it's a tough path, you bitch. I'll be back. Are you ashamed of me? What? I'm not coming, you wench. - Fine, let's go. - No, I won't! Sister? - Sa-rang. - Sis! Sa-rang! Oh my gosh. You've been alive and well. Thank God. My goodness. Is this... really? Yep, it's Sun-deok. Little Sun-deok has grown so much! Hello, Auntie. She looks just like you. So pretty. Of course, she's pretty. Just like me. Except for the attitude. Yes, fortunately. Sun-deok, I feel so guilty whenever I think of you. What do you mean? When your mom had you... Shut up. It's okay. She's all grown up now. - I told her to get rid of you. - Stop the nonsense. Now I see you, and my heart is full. But what brings you here? I was actually... ...pregnant with my second child when I left. What, with that soldier? Anyway, that child is missing now. Missing? I'm late. What's your plan? You said you don't want me there. What do you suggest? I won't go if you don't want me to. Where are you going? She sings. A singer? Like mother, like daughter. Don't even get me started. When she told me she'd sing... I'm going. - See you next time, Auntie. - Sure. Wait up, bitch! You see that attitude? - Give me your number. - Okay. Thanks. My Hyobin, you bloom when you smell the wine. I'm begging you. Help me out this once. He's the landlord's son. Whatever he is. This isn't appropriate. Come on. Please, I ask you this one favor. The lease in this neighborhood is skyrocketing these days. I know this crushes your pride. I did music myself, so why wouldn't I know? Is there any chance, for old time's sake? Shit... There you are. We've been waiting. We'll be right down. I'm sorry. I saw your show last time, and I became your fan. I see. We'll be right out. It's kind of a special occasion. Perhaps you can sing in a lovely tone... - Yes, of course. - Thanks. Sure. Is this why you couldn't replace me? I got no excuse. Fine. I'll do it. Thank you so much. But don't ever do this again. Sure, I'll be out waiting. Hurry and get ready, okay? Thank you! - It's really your first? - Sure it is. - Seriously? - Yeah! Try this. Is it good?

I was just dancing... I'm sorry. The K-pop wave is unstoppable. We have a request for Mamamoo's "Dab Dab" by 0841, wishing the band's successful concert in Paris today. Shit! Goodness. Welcome to our salon. Hell, we're welcomed. What's with the greeting? Is the owner around? He's tattooing someone. Why? Do you know Yuri? Jeong Yuri? I heard that she works here. Don't you know that you need parental approval for hiring a minor? Just stop. Wait, who are you? Her sister. The singer Blue? You are Blue! Yuri bragged so much about you. She said you're her role model and that you'll be huge. Right, there. To my baby sis She's pleasant to work with, but she took a vacation a few days ago. All of a sudden? You don't know where she went? No, ask the boss after he's done. She left soon after I started here. The boss's close with her, so he might know. Why would a tattooist be close with a high schooler? Who are you, by the way? Yuri's mom. Why? Oh, then you must... Yeah, bitch, I got pregnant when I was fourteen, so what? I'm a single mom, too. My baby just turned two. So pretty. Peace! I'm sorry for calling you bitch. How's work? Honestly, it's not easy. But I live for my baby. The boss takes good care of us. Back when Yuri had nowhere to go, he took her in as well. What, take her in? Where? - I mean... - He took her to his home? - Ma'am, that's not... - He's a crazy pervert! Is he in there? Ma'am, you can't go in there. - Let me go. - Wait! - I said let me go. - Ma'am, stop! You bastard! Why would you take a teenage girl home? Where's Yuri? Look at this face. You made her run away, didn't you? Say the truth before I rip your jaw. Is she at your house? Lead the way, you punk! Babe, what's going on? Who are you? Who are you to harass my baby? Do you have a sewing kit? I took knitting classes. What the hell? There's a class for knitting? Where did I put the sewing kit? Her lover's name is Seon-woo, I believe. It was about three months ago. She was all smiles. So I asked her if she's dating, and she said, "How can you tell?" She was always on the phone. So I knew the name was Seon-woo. You know, sometimes couples fight, but nowadays, dating violence is so common. She looked concerned, so I was a bit worried. So you don't know much more about this Seon-woo? Not much. Oh, one second. I got his business card somewhere. Here it is. Rainbow Costumes. I'm sure you can find Seon-woo here. Cockroach! Where? Holy crap! It's a raisin, stupid. Bitch, you scared me. My mistake. Jeez. You don't look like one, but you're a chicken. Frankly, chicken's my nickname. Fried chicken, grilled chicken, baked chicken... A tattooist without a tattoo? Not all veterinarians own a pet. They just need to love and nurture animals. And I love tattoos. Frankly, I made an attempt, but I gave up because it was too painful. So painful. This girl's tough. I apologize for what happened before. That's fine. I know I don't look so trustworthy. Not to me. Is this the song? Yes. You're the singer? - We listen to this all the time. - Wow. ♪ Say nothing but goodbye ♪ ♪ Once again ♪ ♪ You don't remember what I said ♪ I know the lines. It's a pleasure. For baby diapers. Miss Blue, are you still upset? Whatever. You are upset. But you were singing. He wasn't polite. Polite? Learn to think before you act. It's lowbrow. I misunderstood about the tattoo guy. Just stay quiet when you don't know shit. That bitchy attitude. Not to your own mother. Sure, Mother. Oh, hi! Hey. Thanks to you, I found my apartment. - Oh, you found it? - Yeah, I found it. - Good luck! - Thank you. - Thank you. - Oh, thank you! I thought about it, and I think Yuri's pregnant. A dude. Stolen cash. And she suddenly disappeared. Why? Is it like a flashback to you? What? I'm sure she was careful. You set a bad example for her. Quit starting a fight! You're the one who's starting it all day. You don't have a man these days? Go release it somewhere else. I do have a man. You ever saw me taking a break? Never. I wish I could. How's your dad doing? How should I know? If you don't, then who knows? Mom. I've been living alone for over ten years. You two are alike. You both started new families at the same time. So I've been on my own since then. What's with you today? I never meddle in your lives. So, don't you mess with mine. Feeling good? May I help you? His real name is Seon-woo? He told me to call him Michael. Changing names for no reason. There are so many weirdos around here. You're right. Weirdos. So, is Seon-woo or Michael not coming to work today? Well, you can't judge a book by its cover. But I'm sure Michael is hiding something. He disappears during his shifts, and even in winter, he comes back sweating. I wish I can fire him, but I'm afraid that he might retaliate. Look at this. So, are you saying he'll be here or not? It's been three days since he vanished. You got his phone number? I called him, pretending to be concerned. It's not in service. I even tried calling with a different phone. I have his address. Would you like to check it out? - Yes! - One second. - He's the weird one. - Go look in the mirror. This area is crammed with studio flats. It won't be easy to find it. Let's go. - Come again. - Wait. Hey, Jeong-bok. I got an address here. You're still here? Yes. - Please come again. - Sure. - Blue! - Hey. My sister's missing. We need to find this address. Say you're sorry, you little shit! Say sorry! - I'm so sorry. - I'll beat your ass up! Get over here! - It was my bad. - Come here, you little... Ma'am, I'm sorry about before. You can't slap those who smile. So forgive me. What the hell are you saying? Just find the place. Don't you worry. They call me JB the Navigator. What the hell? Is there any other route? There is, but this is the fastest. You said five minutes. Five minutes after this staircase. I can't go further. My thighs are going to burst. How are you so weak? I wasn't breastfed. Bullshit. You say that all the time. You think breast milk cures all? Blue, why don't you quit smoking? You should start caring for yourself. - What do you think? - Shut up and lead. Yes, ma'am! Let go, you asshole! I can't go anymore. I didn't sign up for hiking. Who lives in a place like this? It's right at the top. You like Sun-deok, don't you? Sun-deok? Her real name is Sun-deok? Even her name is pretty. You're in love! What do you see in her? She's tough on the outside, but she's actually soft and kind. Soft and kind? That's the funniest thing I heard today. It's true. You see, I'm Korean, but I had a hard time blending in for obvious reasons. So I was depressed, but she always encouraged me. Now, I'm all good. You see? You're lame. Do you know... that she cried a lot? Why? She'd cry after shows while drinking. She'd talk about you and how hard your life must've been and cry again. But the next day, she's all tough again. Coming? Or you just chitchatting? This way. Blue! Wait for me! Here we are. This is it. We're here. I'll die before I catch this bastard. Sis, should I get up there first? Duh, go check it out. My legs... Why you, bastard! - That's him. Get him! - What? You punk! Stop, you punk! Get him! Quick! Where the hell is he? You little shit! You bastard! What have you done to my daughter, you shithead? What's going on? You know damn well what's going on. Where's Yuri? - Who's Yuri? - Why, you! Let go of me so we can talk. Don't get smart with me. Thank you. You can let go. Thanks, now go eat your chicken. Where's my daughter? Tell the truth, or you're a dead man. I really don't know. Why are you doing this? Let go! You're hurting my hand. You really don't know? Why did you run, then? You chased me. It's a human instinct. You get this feeling that you'll be in big trouble if you get caught. Survival instinct, you know. I was scared. Even now... You're so scary. He's hiding something. Get him up. We'll take this to the police. Bastard. You little punk! - Come back! - I'll kill you! That son of a bitch will pay for this. Thank God it's not worse. Let's separate. We've got to catch him. Looking like this? Go home, wash up, and get changed. Who cares about the looks? Look at yourself. - Not like this. - Damn! Let's go home. Son of a bitch. Don't Go Home Supermarket What's that? Cat food. You got a cat? No, stray cats. Why do you care about stray cats? Because they're like me. How are they like you? They aren't loved by anyone. Someone should at least feed them. You were loved! How's your wound? It hurts! Put this on. Where the hell is she? She'll be in serious trouble once I catch her.

Sa-rang, why didn't you answer my call? Oh, you called? - You're dead, punk. - Sorry, I didn't know. Did you find your kid? No. Why doesn't that dumbass understand me? Why? He keeps saying he doesn't know you. How would he know me? Because you're his boss, silly! What? My bar's over there. This place is for kids. You must be drunk already. He looks like that new guy, Milk. Milk? Not Michael or Seon-woo? I don't know the real name. Damn, how many names does he have? Where is he now? Will be out soon. I'm sorry. You're so handsome, good at your job, and patient. Anyway, I'm sorry. - Sis, let's go. - No, wait. Anyway, I'm sorry. I'll make the call now. Can you come over now? Is it okay? She's here. What? He's not there? This is Michael. He doesn't seem to know where Yuri is. - Ma'am, please! - You piece of shit! You got me running everywhere. - You piece of shit! - Ma'am, calm down! Michael? Your name is Seon-woo. No, I'm Michael. Let go! Show me your ID. So that's your real name. Then why did you run? You mentioned the police. I saved up from hard labor to start my own business. But I got scammed, and I had to rely on illegal loans. So now I got gangsters after me. I had a great recipe. Marinate pork shoulder for 45 days, and it becomes surprisingly juicy and tender without the unpleasant smell. Most people think it's difficult to get premium pork in the city. But through me, it is possible. Some butchers mix the good pork with the average meat. But I won't allow that in my business. I will never sacrifice the quality... - Sis. - I... Who are you? I'm Yuri's friend, Seon-woo. You're Seon-woo? I thought he was a boy. So in the picture that we saw... Seon-woo isn't Michael... You tell her. I already told your daughter. This is Seon-woo. Alright, so what? Yuri's lover. - What? - Why, surprised? I mean... I guess it's possible. Thank you. I heard that you were looking for Yuri. But I wasn't sure if I should butt in or not. A few days ago, we argued over a small thing. I broke up with her. My dad found out about us and beat me up. I didn't want him to hurt Yuri, so I ended it. I'm really sorry. It's okay. What the hell is going on? Could something have happened to Yuri? No, it can't be. Everyone's taste bud is different. It could be bland for you but salty for others. So I only focus on the ingredient... Oh, there's that bitch. Shit, look at that bitch. Is that a bum she's with? Damn... - Dickhead, what did you say? - We dodged a wreck. - Didn't you get it? - What? Lost your brain when you bleached your head? - What? You piece of shit! - Hey! Wait, it's no good fighting them. What are you? - A club for dumb crazy fools? - What? - How much is the membership fee? - Dumb crazy fools? Bastards. Don't stop me. Wait. I think they're drunk. Wait until they start the car. You dare to reject me? I'm the king of the night! Damn. You punks! Get out! King of the night? Get out! Get out! First of all... They were driving under the influence since they started the car. But you still have to pay for the damage to the car. Fine, we'll pay for the stupid car. We'll pay for the stupid car! Chun-bae. Yuri's really gone missing. What now? Oh yeah, we checked the surveillance footage from her building. Maybe they found her. Right here. - Is that her? - Yes! Yuri, where are you going? I got a call while on search, so I asked them to send it over. We're looking for her, so don't worry. I shouldn't have left her with you. What did you say? Bitch! You said you'd take care of her. Watch your filthy mouth. Filthy mouth? You'd better shut your filthy mouth. - I'm your mom! - You call yourself a mom? Do you even have a conscience? Are you out of your mind? You think I wanted to leave? You kept bringing men to that tiny flat. How do you expect me to live there? You loved it when I left. You acted as if you were all worried, but inside, you were relieved. Did you know that I was only in 7th grade? How many times did you come to see me after that? Worried? You act as if you care about Yuri. It makes me sick. What do you know about... Me? Do you know how I lived my life? Stop with the excuses. Why is any of that my fault? Is it my fault? Did I push you over the edge? You think your life would've been better without me? Nothing would've been different. You'd be the same. You're not done here yet. - Sun-deok is... - Stop. I don't need pity. It's chilly out. Sun-deok, your mom... Stop. I don't need pity. See you inside. Hey, hey! Come on. Where are you going? Concert in Paris, France It's her, right? Yes... Is it? It's her. She loves Mamamoo. Bitch didn't even mention it. That little bitch could've told me. If she had, you would have let her go? Hell no. Thank you for everything, back then and now. Sis, I've got to get back to the bar. I'm so happy you found your girl. Thanks, Sa-rang. Come with Sun-deok for a drink. - I'll call you. - See you, Sun-deok! Bye, Auntie. - I'll call you. - Yes, call me. Don't be too hard on Yuri. I won't. Mom, you coming to the show? I'm not going. Why, are you upset? What? Let's go. Alright, then. Bye.
