[ laughter ] - How is that the subject of our conversations always turn to sex? - 'Cause people like to talk about the things that they want and they never get. - Romance? - Like blowjobs. - Yeah, buddy, with you all the way. [ chuckles ] - My wife's vagina looks like a parenthesis with an afro. - Well, I'm not sure I understand vaginas. - What's to understand? A pussy is a doorway. You go in, and you come out. Les, you're up, buddy. - Whereas my wife won't even give me a blowjob. I mean, I go down on her, and everything's fine, but when it comes to returning the favor, she always says, "No, no, no, it's not ladylike." I mean, what's not ladylike about that? - You should try my wife. She gives great blowjobs. - Are you kidding, man? - Flo knows what a man needs. > Ask Connie. He's been on the receiving end. - Flo knows. [ laughter ] See, fellas, we're about symbiosis. The women -- They bring the main dish, and the men -- They bring the dessert. - That little casserole thing that they've got going on -- It's like a gift waiting under the tree...for us to open. - [ laughs ] So, you guys should come over friday night, bring the wives. - It'll be fun. - Say again. - You have to populate. ♪ Populate [ laughter ] - Oh, I'll be sure to bring Patti. - It's time to act like ancient Romans. - Men, grab your sticks. It's time to throw our balls around. [ light laughter ] - Right. - I'm a little uncomfortable with stereotypes. - Do you like the way I look in this? - Sure. - What does that mean? Do you think I look pretty? - Doll, I've lived with you for 12 years, and I'm not gonna fall into your circle of conversation. - It's not a circle. It's communication. Just a simple answer. Just look at me and tell me if you think I look pretty. Say yes or no. - You look delicious. If you were a cake, I'd eat you up. - There. That wasn't so hard, was it? I don't know, though. I think this belt hits me a little high in the waist. I don't have a waist. Where are you going? - In the tv room, where there's no belts. - You don't care how I look at all, do you? You wouldn't mind if I walked around in front of our friends without a waist. - Belle, why don't you just take the belt off? - And look like a shapeless sack? No, thank you. You're so clueless about fashion. Max, please. I just finally got my makeup right. [ birds chirping ] - Sterling. - Ned. - Hail Caesar. - When in Rome, when in Rome. - Kit, I'd like you to meet Ned an Marjorie Lavon. Ned, Marjorie, this is my wife, Kitty. And this is Gayle and Patti Parker. - What a lovely home. And your Haciendas -- They're so beautiful. - They're Hydrangeas, darling. - But I'm fine. Not fine -- I'm -- What does "fine" mean, anyway? It's such a nothing word. I've...been okay. I'm sound. I'm with it. I'm...Groovy. [ chuckles ] [ laughing ] I feel so stupid. I try to sound relevant, and I just can't sell it, can i? - No. - I mean, "I'm groovy" -- What does that mean? I mean, it means I'm -- Mlah! It sounds like something an album would say. I mean, if you were gonna anthropomorphize an album, it would be right in saying, "i'm groovy." [ laughs ] - Take a swig of this. - [ coughs ] Good lord, Jerome, what is that, turpentine? - Just about. Leslie has a still in the basement. - Jerome, we're not in the hills of Tennessee. This is a respectable community. - Respectable, my ass. - Screw it. I want to get drunk. Give me more. - That's it, Sugar. Let it all go. - [ exhales heavily ] - [ laughs ] - I mean, who are those people, anyway? I don't want them here. I thought this party was just for us -- private. Oh. Hello, Max. - I made Shepherd's Pie. I ground the Spam myself. [ birds chirping ] - Damn arthritis. I hate our bodies. You know, it's a design flaw that they start falling apart before we die. Who on earth thought of that, anyway? - The Lord God in heaven above, of course. He created us. - Well, he should have had his damn license revoked, giving an expiration date to a consciousness. How cruel. How fucking cruel is that? [ laughs ] - He gave you life, after all. Don't forget that. - What he gave me is the ability to know that I'm going to die, and I find that excruciating. So, go ahead and believe in your god if you must, but at least acknowledge the fact that he is most psychopathic serial killer of all time. I mean, if any one of us were to just reach across the table and strangle the life out of her, would it make any difference to the world? I mean, her god kills people all the time, every day. So, it must be all right for us to do the same thing. Wouldn't you think? Hypothetically speaking. - Oh, is there anything I can do to help? - No, honey, we're just getting ready. - Excuse me. - Are you sure? - So, forgive me for not knowing, but do we take our clothes off now or later? I've just never done this kind of thing before. - Whenever you feel like, honey. - What? - Well, Gayle didn't tell me if we'd be screwing each other before dinner or after dinner. - [ gasps ] - Which is it? [ laughter ] - Ned, sweetie, we're going. - We just got here. We're not leaving yet. - Something's come up at church. - I don't want to go. - I know what's going on here. I'm not an idiot. - Marjorie, take the car and go home. - What? - Take the car and go home. - Ned lavon, I'm your wife.

[ both laugh ] - Are you as thirsty as I am? - Oh, you bet. [ glass clinks ] - Sterling? - Yes? - [ chuckles ] This is fun, man. Thank you. - You're welcome. - Oh, damn it. Ran out of booze. [ bottle thuds ] - Nah, it's cool. We can share. [ up-tempo Motown music playing ] [ indistinct singing ] - Mnh. [ gasps ] [ sighs ] Hey, sterling, I can't. Um, I don't think I can kiss a man 'cause I'm a Christian. - Me, too, man. Christians make the best lovers. - [ breathing heavily ] - Remember -- Judas kissed Christ. - ♪ If you're lonely [ singing indistinctly ] - In a scene described by one investigator as reminiscent of a weird religious rite, five persons, including actress Sharon Tate... - [ crying ] - ...Were found dead at the home of Ms. Tate and her husband, screen director Roman Polanski. Ms. Tate, who starred in "The Valley of the Dolls," was eight months pregnant and was found in a bikini-type nightgown with a rope around her neck, attached to the body of a man. - Two bodies inside, two bodies outside. - Among the other victims were hollywood hair stylist Jay Sebring and coffee heiress Abigail Folger. Authorities found nobody in unofficial capacity inside the plush $200,000 home in the Hollywood hills overlooking Los Angeles. When police arrived, they found the telephone and electricity lines cut. The bodies had been dead about 12 hours, discovered this morning by a maid who ran screaming to the neighbors. An officer summed up the murders when he said, "In all my years, I've never seen anything like this before." [ crickets chirping ] - Why did the philosopher drown? Because he jumped in the lake and thought about swimming. [ birds chirping ] - Ohh, Jesus. [ exhales sharply ] Déjà vu. [ chuckles ] [ inhales sharply ] Aah! - Is he dead? - Get in. - Is he dead? - Honey -- - No. Is he dead? - Honey -- - No. Is he? - Honey. - Patti, don't come outside. - No. Leslie! Ugh! Let me go! - He's dead! - Let me go! - He's dead. - [ breathing heavily ] He's moving. [ cries ] - You want to take a ride? - I have to ask my dad, and he's not here. - What's she doing over there? - Every time somebody says "groovy" on on the television, she's taking a drink. - Does my face look red to you? - Marybelle, you are always so concerned with your face. - Do you think angels live in our hair? - Marybelle? - Angels. Do you think angels in live our hair? I think angels are real and tiny and transparent and they live in our hair. Sometimes they sit and dangle their feet over the top of our ears so that they can give us advice when we're having trouble. - Marybelle. [ can opener whirring ] - [ sniffles ] - Jerome? - I can do the headstand, Leslie. Want to see? You like that? - Uh, Jerome -- - Oh, no. Jerome, Jerome, we're not gonna do this. - Jerome, get down. - Jerome, no. [ indistinct arguing ] - [ crying ] I want to die! - Okay, babe. It's okay. It's okay, babe. - [ cries ] - I think I know how to make that happen right now. - What a mess. - Sit down, and I'll get you your dinner. - Another bubbling concoction of crap? Why can't we ever have a real meal? - Well, this one is turkey turkey divan strata, and you love it. I made it for you our first night in this house. Do you remember, Connie? - Steak would be a good meal. You're too lazy to cut up some real vegetables and grill me a piece of meat? - Well, this has turkey in it and it's got some spinach and it's very, very good for you, Connie. - Sterling says Kitty makes a different meal every night. [ chair legs scrape ] - Kitty is not creative. - What about roast chicken? I would love a roast chicken. - Kitty is my very good friend. I can assure you, she is not roasting chickens. Kitty does not know how to bake a potato. - You don't even try. You do nothing. Hell, even the can opener does the work for you. Connie, today was Leslie's day. I didn't have time to truss you a bird. - "i didn't have time to truss you a bird." You're a stupid little hole, you know that? [ liquid pours ] [ bottle thuds ] - Connie, I saw you fucking that bitch. And I saw that you liked it. Is it 'cause she was a stranger? Is that what it takes now, Connie, a stranger? - Do you really want to get into this now? - Well, I'm just not so sure why you invited those people into our house. They're not part of our little group. - You mean they had nothing to do with you and Max Beedum. - I don't know what you're talking about. - Oh, come on, Sugar. Be honest. You've been wet for Max since they moved across the street. I know how that deceitful mind of yours works. You couldn't wait to get Max inside you. You planned that party, got us all drunk so you'd have an excuse to live out your fantasy. - I'll tell you something. You take things, and you mess it around. I don't know how to reach you anymore, Connie. I don't know how to talk to you! - You don't know what you're talking about. - Would you like one scoop, or would you like two? - I don't want your fucking casserole! I am sick of it. I'm sick of you. I'm sick of this house. I'm sick of your whiny mouth. - I made you that dinner, Connie. You used to like that dish! You used to love, love, love turkey divan strata! I worked hard to make dinner tonight because I wanted to make you happy! I work hard to make you happy, Connie, and you ruin it! You ruined our dinner! You get drunk and you get mad and you ruin everything! You lock yourself in that fucking bathroom and you -- You go after that -- Whatever you do to yourself, Connie! Your leg. Your leg looks like raw hamburger meat! How am I supposed to love that? - Shut your fucking mouth! - [ crying ] Just stop it. Just...Stop it. [ sniffles ] [ breathing heavily ] Connie... I'm pregnant. - Whore. Isn't that an ugly word? Hmm? I think it's the hard "h" sound -- "hah" -- Followed by that hard "r" -- "orr." It's a really ugly word, isn't it? "Whore." You almost have to expectorate to say it. "Whore"! I think that's what makes it such a horrible word, not just the consonants hitting each other, but it takes effort to say it. "Whore"! You really have to push to get it out. - [ crying ] Help me. Just help me. - [ crying ] Whore. Whore! - No. Don't leave me, Connie. Please don't leave me. - Get off of me. - Please don't leave me, Connie. Connie, come back here, please. Please, Connie. I'm just so sorry! Connie, I'm sorry! Please come back here! Connie! - I'm a lemon. I'm a bag of Jello. Look at me. I'm a yeti. - Oh, no, you're not. - You're thick. I like you fine just the way you are. - I'm a...Ballast. - Don't be ridiculous. We're in this together, remember? - [ sighs ] Look. Okay? I'm not exactly a tasty dish. - What are you talking about? You are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. I'm a manatee. God, when did this happen? I'm not even a man anymore. - Of course you are. You're my man. - I'm not. I'm a dump truck. I'm a cruise liner. I'm the darn Isthmus of Panama. - You're perfect to me. Okay? [ gasps, whimpers ] You're perfect to me. - Hey, Ned. Can you come here for a second? - What do you want? [ birds chirping ] - What's going on, ned? - I got to be someplace. I got to go. - Wait. - I thought maybe we could, um, get together sometime. - Sterling, I'm not that way. I'm sorry. - Really? - Really. - You know, for not being that way, you sure give a hell of a blowjob, buddy. Ugh! - Stay the fuck out of my life. [ door creaks ] - Oh, my god. Sterling, what happened? - [ voice breaking ] I messed up, Kitty. [ cries ] - Oh. Shh. Okay. I'm here. I'm here. Okay, honey? [ smooches ] - [ continues crying ] - Shh. - [ speaking indistinctly ] - Hey, I'm not going anywhere. I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. [ birds chirping ] - Hello, Max. I've missed you so much. - Sugar, what are you doing here? - You're all sweaty, Max. - I just got back from a run. - How long will it take you to pack? My things are all ready. I figure if we leave now, we could be to vegas by nightfall. - [ chuckles ] Sugar, what are you talking about? - Oh, we're gonna start a new life together, Max, you and i. Won't it be divine? I'm having our baby, Max. We did it, you and i. Baby Beedum. It'll be the most beautiful baby ever. I've never felt this way before. You don't understand. I feel alive for the first time ever in my whole life, Max. Everything is going to be okay, Max. - Sugar, I don't know what's going on in that head of yours, but I am not leaving my wife. - But you're gonna be a daddy, Max, a real father. - How do you know it's mine? Everyone was with everyone. What about Connie? - Connie hasn't touched me in eons. - We were drunk. We were having fun. You probably forgot, and this is someone else's mistake. - [ laughing ] A mistake? No, Max, don't be silly. We love each other. I love you, and you love me. We met in private, remember? That made it different. - Sugar... I love Marybelle. She's my wife. And I'm not gonna leave her, not now, not ever. - Oh. - I'm sorry, Sugar. I'm sorry if you got the wrong idea. - Oh, no, I'm fine. I'm just fine. Everything's gonna be okay. [ sighs ] I'm okay. What am I supposed to do, Max? What am I supposed to do? - You'll figure it out, Sug. [ door closes ] [ birds chirping ] [ crickets chirping ] - Leslie. [ chuckles ] Leslie. [ smooches ] [ watch clatters ] - You look good like that, natural. Oh, Max. My eyes disappear. And my lips are too thin. - I don't like the paint. - [ chuckles ] - All the other girls are so put together, so with it. I've got to be more like that. I'm such a square. - Belle, come here. I've been thinking. Let's try to have a baby. - Oh, Max. I don't know. I'd have to buy a whole new wardrobe. [ chuckles ] And this house is our house. It's not a house for a baby. - You are beautiful just like this. And I don't care about any of that stuff. I want to start over again, move away from here. - Are you -- Move away from our friends? - Everyone. - Oh, Max, yes. Yes, I want to. [ sniffles ] We'll buy a new house, a bigger house. - Yeah. - And we'll paint it. I'll pick out soothing colors for a baby, and we'll put a swing set in the backyard. And we'll have real grass. - Yeah. - And trees. - We can move to Colorado. - Yes. - Away in the mountains. - Yes. - Away from everybody. - And I'll slide out of bed in the morning and pull my hair back and make pancakes for the whole family. - Oh, I want to. - We can live somewhere with no mirrors, right? No mirrors. - Yes, belle-belle. We don't have to live with any of that stuff. - I feel like everybody's always looking at me. - The only neighbors we'll have are the deer and the squirrels. [ both laugh ] [ sniffles ] - Come on. Help me. [ both laughing ] And more. Grab them all. [ grunting ] - [ grunts ] [ breathing heavily ] [ grunts ] [ both breathing heavily ] I love you, wife. - I love you, husband. [ both smooch ] [ indistinct speaking on tv ] - Very, very fine-grained as you get close to it. It's almost like a powder. The ground mass is very fine. [ radio chatter ] - Jesus H. Christ. - Holy shit. - [ exhales heavily ] - How did we miss this the first time? - [ chuckles ] - Un-fucking-believable. [ radio chatter ]
