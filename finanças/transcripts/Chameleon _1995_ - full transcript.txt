Damn it! The place looks like West Com Pharmaceutical. Welcome to the wonderful world of cocaine. If you can't smuggle it, cut out the middleman and process it yourself. Well, well, well, well. We may just get lucky yet. There's no way that bust goes wrong unless somebody tipped it! I'm telling you, Gianni, it's not an agent! I handpicked these guys! Or maybe Lindam and Nelson wrote their confessions on a piece of paper before they had their heads blow off! Aw, you're right. The leaks gotta be on my side. I don't even know these guys out there. Three months I'm here. I can't even remember my secretary's name. Cindy. Cindy. Who else knew about the investigation? Aw, it could be anybody. Well, we've still got the tie to the prison and Pazatto. Yeah. One small snag. No evidence. Listen, you run around here pointing the finger, and everybody guilty or innocent is gonna start covering their asses. That's not gonna get you anywhere. You worried about me, Tommy? We're not in New York anymore, Mat. Tell me about it. It's very political out here. These people offend easily. They do, huh? I got a leak in my office and a bunch of dead agents, okay. Fuck politics. I called Washington. We're gonna need some outside help. Couldn't we do this in a coffee shot like normal people? I suppose we could. It wouldn't be half as entertaining though. You bureaucratic guys just love this clandestine bullshit, don't you? Well, sometimes it's bullshit. Sometimes it isn't. You got any questions? Yeah. How does Gianni fit in? He doesn't. Gianni was running an investigation in LA. We didn't know anything about it. It almost led him to Cortessi. We couldn't let that happen. We had to tip it off. We had no idea that that place was wired. It's always the same. The suits screw it up, guys like us have to pay for it. Gianni thinks he has a leak in his office. He's requested a "clean" agent. Well, you're the best. And then he stumbled on to something', maybe he leads us to Cortessi. But he can't know anything about it. You interested? You knew damn well there was no way I'd walk away from this. Gianni won't be easy. Don't worry about Gianni. I can handle him. Good. You don't mind the red-eye, do you? Here it is! You have a little daughter. We have a little girl! Oh, look at her! Honey, she looks so beautiful. Look at her. Dad, Dad... Yeah. Dad... Do you want to cut the cord here? Sure. All right. Right there. Nice and easy. Okay. Ah, ha. Very good. Congratulations. Oh, honey. Oh, baby, we did it. You did it. She's so beautiful. Willmmaaa! Do yourself a favor, Chief, and find another bench. Hey, man, I hear you need an honest agent. Where in the hell'd you steal that? Hey, listen, at three o'clock, I want you to be at 10271, 6th Street. Go inside the lobby, wait for five minutes, man. If you're not being followed, there'll be a cab waiting for you outside. If there's no cab, go home, man. I'll call you later, I'll contact you. We got a lot of catching' up to do. What are you talking about? What the hell is this? Later, Chief. Oh, you gotta be kidding me. Willie Serling? Hop in, Chief. The meter's running. Come on in, Chief. Come on. You can't be too careful. There's a lot of weirdos running' around out there. Take me for example. You live here, do you? For the time being. So what the hell ever happened to you, Willie? Been working', man. Been under. How you been, Chief? How long you been back? A lawyer is a lawyer is a lawyer. You writing' a book? Let's call it professional curiosity. Long enough. How often do you come up for air? I don't. Is this a job interview? I was under the impression that you were looking for an agent. If you're not, it's okay. I'll be on my way. But if you are... There's a couple of rules. Number one, I call the shots. Try again. I took this assignment 'cause I like you. Most people think you're an asshole. But I think you're uncompromising. And that's good. My ass is on the line in this. I call all the shots. What the hell are you trying to do to me, huh? This guy is a nut-bar! Nut-bar. Where's you get that? Hey, look, he's been totally cleared to work again. Are you kidding me? It doesn't take Sigmund Freud to realize this guy's over the edge. You know what you don't like, Johnny, is the fact that you're not in control. That's all. Oh, please, spare me the fifty-cent psychology lesson, all right? This is not the same guy I used to know. He hasn't recovered. He probably never will. He can get the job done. Isn't that what you need? He's going inside of a prison. I'm the only one who knows he's gonna be in there. Do you have any idea what I'm saying? Oh, yes. That's exactly why I sent him. Trust me, Matt. He's perfect for this kind of thing. Did you just say, "Trust me?" I heard you say, "Trust me." You know something, Langston, you would fit in very well out here. This is me hanging up. So that's when we discovered the desert lab. Stumbled. You stumbled into it. You busting' my balls here, Willie? All right, I admit, in any successful investigation there's a certain element of luck. Yeah? Well, I don't believe in luck. We believe the lab belonged to the Pazatto Family. Currently, Giovanni Pazatto's serving 10 to 15 in Hawley Federal Prison, but we know he's still pulling the family strings. We couldn't nail him on the outside, so we're gonna give it a shot on the inside. Which is where you come in. I, uh, put together a record for you. Gave you a name that ends with a vowel. Should make you very attractive. How's your Italian? Good. Okay. That'll make it easier. Yeah, well, while I'm cozying up to Pazatto risking my life eating prison food, what are you gonna be doing? Trying to find a leak in my brand new office. Oh, yeah? Well, good luck, Chief. That's why I stayed under. Bad guys are always bad. But the good guys? Who knows? Thought you said you had no social life? I don't. That's Tom Wilson, my lead agent. I told him to meet us here. Yeah, I guess we're done then. Hey, Willie, Willie, Willie, relax, will ya? This guy's okay. I guarantee it. He's not just my best agent, he's my closet friend. All right? You gotta trust somebody here. Trust me, Chief, and consider yourself blessed. This is ridiculous. How do you know you can even trust me? 'Cause you're the one who clicked his heels together three times. Can't get back to Kansas if you screw the good witch. No! Anthony Tavoni. 34 years old. Convicted of two counts armed robbery, $150,000 worth of computer hardware. Any chance you know how to use this computer hardware, Mr. Tavoni? Does a fat Italian smell like garlic? I never steal anything I can't use. That would be wrong. Well, you're in luck today, my friend. You're lucky to be Italian and you're lucky that I need someone who understands computers. May I call you Anthony? No. Only my mother calls me Anthony. You can call me Tony. Tony. Oh! Tony's all right. Tony, where was your father born? Palermo. Palermo. Parla Siciliano con il genitori, Tony? Not a damn word. Oh, that's too bad. Tradition is a beautiful thing. Never, never deny the blood, Tony. Remember that. Always remember that. Yeah, well, my mother was Irish. She was tougher than my old man. She would've told you where you could shove your tradition. I like you. You're interesting. You see, we take care of our own here. How would you feel about coming' to work for me? Hmm? I don't need a job. My room, meals, provided for. Make things very comfortable for you here. What makes you think that you can trust me with whatever the hell it is you're doing' here? Unfortunately, Tony, in a federal prison, it's not the ideal place to find suitable applicants. You were the best we could do. And I don't trust anyone. Hmm? How soon can you move me out of the stinking' hole that I'm in? Moving' you as we speak. Pazatto's got the Warden in his pocket. Nobody enters this section unless they're family. Hey, give me one of them. Come on. To hell with Mexico. We process it right here in the good old U.S. of A. Kind of makes you wanna sing the national anthem. You gotta be shitting me. Well, the good news is, they like me. They really like me, Chief. Milk is pure coke, cakes are kilos. We cut it with sugar. And we move all the decimal points down two spaces on the prices. It looks like we're running a damn bakery here. Production's up twenty-three percent. Yeah. Yeah. Cortessi's gonna be pleased, real pleased with this. I was under the impression that I work for you. Cortessi I don't know. You do work for me. Cortessi you don't need to know about. That's how it works. You understand that? Run through this again for me. Hey, Tony. Do you think you could teach me how to run one of these computers? Not unless you're in for life. He give you the zuma-zuma! You know what a zuma-zuma is? Yeah. You know what a zuma-zuma is? Have a drink of water over there. Hey, Tony. Anybody ever tell you, you eat like a pig? All right, all right, all right, all right. To the egghead over here. The weirdest son of a bitch I ever seen in my life! To the egghead! What brings you down here, Tony? I'm waiting for a phone call. From who? The FBI, you shit-head. What's it to you? It's some broad, isn't' it? Jeez, Giancarlo, you're a genius, you know that? If Pazatto finds out you're down here, he ain't gonna like it. The phones are off limits. Oh, really? And what the hell are you doing down here then? Hey, we all got private business on the outside. You ain't the first one to sneak down here. Is she worth it? I let her shave my head. Federal emergency, pal! Who is this idiot? Either find another phone or you're under arrest. I wouldn't let no broad shave my head. If you saw this broad, you'd let her shave whatever she wanted. You need some of this? I never touch that shit. Yo. Yeah, it's me. Where the hell have you been? Hey, baby doll. What? Hang on a second, would you? Give me some privacy, would ya? She wants me to talk dirty to her. Oh! Paisan, ask her if she'll shave my ass. Hey, honey, you own a lawn mower? No, Willie, I got a weed-eater. What the hell's going on there? Get me out of here, Chief. Make it legitimate. I don't wanna burn any bridges. Are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. I got the whole operation on floppy disc. It's 10 times bigger than we ever thought. It's unbelievable. So when do we move? We don't. We follow the money. Nobody cleans this much cash without a lot of help. Hey, Stuart, having a lot of fun here at camp. Going fishing tomorrow. I'm hoping to find some good bait. Gimme a call. Tell you all about it. You like the pasta, huh? Outstanding. Almost as good as prison food. Thank you. Don't take it so hard. We had a black hat chef on the inside. Killed a waiter for putting steak sauce on the Beef Wellington. Pazatto had me followed from prison. What happened to the guy that was tailing you? Come on, Chief. You're sitting with me right now, and you're not sure who I am. What chance do you think the guy on the street had? Listen, Willie, I never really had an opportunity to, uh, talk to you after what happened to Ellen, and um... I admire that you do what you had to be done. And I'm sorry. That's a bitchin' alarm system you got there, Chief. How much that set you back? Two grand. You got ripped off. I know. It's okay. Outside of what I got on floppy disc, which they don't know about, you look like Inspector Clouseau at the moment. Yes, well... I'll get you an ashtray. So why wait? I mean, between what you know and what we got on this computer disc, we got enough to take down the whole prison right now. Two reasons. Number one, if you wanna hurt these guys, you gotta go after their money, and I know where it goes. Number two. Pazatto ain't the head of the snake. You know who is? A guy named Cortessi. Used to be a hitman for the mob, big time. Albert Cortessi? Is he a friend of yours? We tried to indict this guy twice in the New York office. He'll kill you for cutting in line, this guy. If this money trail leads us to Cortessi, I'll kiss you. That's quite an incentive, Chief. What kind of animal would live in a dump like this? Thank you all. Mr. Conwell? I was informed just before I came in here by someone on my staff, that we're going ahead with the replacement computer for the money transfer system. Of course, I was going to tell you... I don't appreciate other people making my decisions. That's my department, so, either let me run it or get someone else. Let me know what you decide. Thank you. She does say what's on her mind, doesn't she? Betty, did I have any calls? Oh, uh, Jill, Jill, this is Mr. Bill Sadler. He's the independent auditor we've been hearing about. Hi. Bill, this is Ms. Hallman. Hello. It's a pleasure to meet you. Hmm. Oh, don't you just love the accent? I was just saying, we don't often get such handsome auditors. Well, if you're trying to soften me up, you're going about it the right way. Actually, I don't often get such pleasant and beautiful auditees. Coffee? Ms. Hallman... It was lovely to meet you, Betty. Oh, you too, Bill. I'm really quite looking forward to working with you. Nice technique. I beg your pardon? Oh, the old fashion chivalry routine. You don't get that much anymore. But it worked really well with Betty. You don't approve? Oh, I don't know. I'm sure that it's lot better than the macho caveman thing. Anyway, I'm sorry. I've got meetings all day long, so, if we need to talk, you're gonna have to set up a time with Betty. It was nice to meet you. Oh, and you. Yes. ♪ How do I, how do I How do I leave when it's you? ♪ Chariot, chariot, sweeten and sugarcane ♪ Kiss me, kiss me till I feel no pain ♪ You're not the same Bill Sadler who sang backup for the Coasters, are you? No. Oh! Too bad. I heard he'd gone into banking. You, uh, you don't sing at all, do you? A little, uh, shoo-be-doo-bop here and there something like that? Unfortunately, shoo-be-doo-bop's a little out of my league. Do-lang Do-lang, maybe. Oh, a man after my own heart. Hi, Morris Steinfield. William Sadler. You know, there never was a William Sadler that sang with the Coasters. Whoa, you really are an auditor. Actually, that's a little bit I use on all the new people. If they slam the door in my face, I immediately start lobbying to get them fired. If they don't... I invite them to join us all at Happy Hour. What happens if they actually start singing with you? Well, that only happened once, and I married her. To tell you the truth, I'm not sure what I'd do if it happened again. Well, thank God I wasn't the one to find out. Look, I'll have to take a rain check on those drinks, if that's okay. Well, the gals will be disappointed. I'll just have to see what I can do to ease their pain. ♪ Cherry lips, cherry lips, cherry, cherry, ooh ♪ Mommy. Mommy, please come out. Mommy! Honey, okay, sweetie. Sweetheart, what happened? It's okay. It's okay. That's a nice little monthly bonus, Ms. Hallman. Morris, are you busy? At the risk of my future in banking, no. What can I do for you? Yoo-hoo. Morning. Um... What do you know about Ms. Hallman? Are we talking professionally or non? Um, strictly social. I know two things. I want her and I can't have her. Well, that pretty much sums it up. Um, is she available? This I don't know. For such information you must speak with Betty. Oh, great. Great. Oh, one more thing. But just so there are not misunderstandings, let me say. I am a happily married man with three beautiful children who I love dearly. However, I would drop them all like a bad rash for 10 intimate minutes with Ms. Hallman. Right. Understood. Good luck. Right. Right. Betty. Twenty-eight years old, 5'7", 118, pounds, athletic, loves Bruce Springsteen. Never been married, eats tuna fish at least three times a week. Masters degree from USC in finance. And... Rumor has it, and I emphasize the word "Rumor", she has been dating our dear old President, Jason Ainsley. Which, of course, is strictly taboo, based on company policy. So they have to be very discreet. Well, apparently not discreet enough. You're quite amazing, Betty. Oh, thanks, doll. It always pays to be on good terms with the auditor. If you know what I mean. Absolutely. Oh. - Hi, Bob. - Hi, hi. Is, uh, there a problem? No, no, certainly not. Betty was just giving me some insight how the office secretarial staff operates. She should know. Don't tell anybody, but she actually runs this place. Oh. You're in good hands. Yeah, she's... She's a peach. Oh. And when the evil perpetrator casts the first nuclear stone, the Almighty will snatch it from its course of destruction and hurt it back from whence it came! And then sinners... Sinners like you, sir... Get outta here. Sinners like you will burn in hell! Get lost, pal. While those of us who accept the grace will rejoice in the word! Hey, Chief! Chief! How's it hanging? Willie... There's gotta be an easier way to do this. Well, sure there is, but it wouldn't be half as entertaining. Um, here's the latest on nuclear disarmament. My money's on Ms. Hallman. She's got access, the know-how and a hidden ballooning bank account. Have a nice day. My children! Can I hear amen? Can I hear it? Amen! Amen. Ms. Hallman. Oh, come in. Sorry to, uh, to barge in on you like this. We need to talk. Sit down. No, actually, I'm fine. What's this about? Morris Steinfield. You're kidding me. He's one of the best people I've got. I know. I know. I really don't know what to say. Could we talk about this over lunch? I'm starving. Um, well, uh, yes. I guess so. Good. Good, good. Excellent. Actually, you know, I... I normally bring lunch and eat in the park. You could have half my tuna sandwich if you'd like. Okay. Sure. Great, great. So I'll meet you in the park in 15 minutes. Right. Hi. Hello. Please, um, sit. Sit down. What is this? Oh! This is lunch. That's tuna, kosher dills, and chips. Please sit down. And you do this often? Well, yes. Every day. I hope you don't mind red wine with tuna. I suppose you always carry two of everything, just in case. Well, you never know when a friend drops by. So, what about Morris Steinfield? Well, I'm afraid there's only enough for two. No, I mean, what was it that you wanted to tell me? Oh, that. He's doing a great job. You couldn't tell me that in my office? Well, of course I could. But it wouldn't be half as entertaining now, would it? Would you, uh, care for a Pringle? Thank you. Come on, honey. Don't be mad. I spent 150 bucks on dinner. And let you ride my Jaguar. What's a guy have to do these days? Oh. Burn, baby, burn. No dessert tonight, slick. What? Good morning, Chief. You alone? That's very funny. What do you want? What time is it? What do you know about Jason Ainsley? For this you woke me? One minute I don't call enough, the next man, I call too much. Make your damn mind up. All right, all right, all right. Uh, local celebrity. Golf with the governor. That type of crap. Why? He any good? How the hell do I know? I never played with him. Get a grip, Chief. At the bank. Oh. Yeah, yeah. If reputation means anything, he's great. Got any power politically? He can pull a few strings. Well, thanks, Chief. No, no. Thank you. You know, if you got a little sleep, you wouldn't be so damn grumpy. Chief? You can stay wherever it is you are and I'll meet you there if you like. Dreaming of exotic places? No, not exactly. What's up? Well, this may appear as a bold move at first, but bear with me. You're probably thinking, "This chap's a little weird, "but the whole tuna sandwich thing touched me somehow. "And I'd go out to dinner with him in a minute "if only I knew him a little better." Am I right? I knew it. I could tell from the look in your eyes that we speak the same language more or less. But before you say anything, perhaps I can bring you up-to-date on my life, such as it is, to ease any concerns that you may have regarding joining me for dinner tonight. Behold, the four stages of a man as captured by Kodak. This is a man on a rug, age four months. Um, quite naked. Um... This is the first day of Junior Soccer League. This is Senior Social Dance. Uh, or prom, as you Americans call it. And this is me appallingly drunk at my 21st birthday. To know me is to love me. How does seven-ish sound? Make it 7:30. Give me a little time to, uh, put together some visual aids for... My presentation. Hmm, quite right. It's important, 7:30-ish then. To tell you the truth, I was, uh, surprised that you said yes to dinner. How could I say no? After all, I've seen you naked. That's what I meant. Actually, um, I heard that you were, um, seeing someone on a regular basis. Really? Where, may I ask, did you hear this? As if I didn't already know. Well, it wouldn't be proper for me to reveal my sources now, would it? Are you? What? Seeing someone on a regular basis? Oh. Um, no. No, not anymore. Good. Great. Well, oh, actually, no. It's not good, is it? Could we change the subject? Yes, yes. Actually, I'd like to talk about you for a while. Despite your fine presentation this morning, I don't know that much about you. Well, what would you like to know? Are you... Married, divorced, or mending a broken heart? A multiple-choice quiz. That's fabulous. I love those. Well, better safe than sorry. Well, um, actually, it's none of the above. Oh. Now that usually means that you're afraid to make a commitment. Good Lord. I thought I had the right answer. That's not fair, it wasn't on the test. Oh, okay. Sorry, no more trick questions. Are you? Am I what? Afraid to make a commitment? Can I... Can I get back to you on that? Well, I had a wonderful time. Um... I would like to invite you up for a drink, but I'd prefer that you didn't read anything into it. Hmm. Well, a drink would be just fine. Thank you. Good. Is white wine okay? It's all I've got. Well, in that case, I'll have white wine. Good. Um, could I have some, uh, ice in mine, please? Ice you said? It's chilled already. Oh, great, great. Um, do you have any, uh, cheese and crackers? Cheese and crackers. Uh... No. No cheese and crackers. You are not gonna tell me that you're still hungry? Well, actually, yes... Uh, I am. I unfortunately have the same metabolism I had when I was 15. Oh, wouldn't that be great. I still eat everything I want, but now it means aerobics classes four times a week. Cheers. He looks familiar. That wouldn't be the somebody that you're not involved with anymore, would it? He could be. He's rather a remarkable man. Oh, so I've heard. Well, I guess that just depends on who you're talking to. Right. Sorry. I didn't mean to pry. It's an occupational hazard, I guess. So, um, you, uh, read Tolstoy? Oh, no. That's just there to impress first dates. Next time you come over, I'll have Dr. Seuss back up. Great. Well, I'll look forward to that. Thanks. I just don't feel like talking about that right now. It's not a problem. I understand. You know, I think you do. I think you do. You're a very, um... Very unusual man. Or maybe I'm just a little bit drunk. Maybe you are a little bit drunk. Maybe I should go. Thanks for the wine. No, no. Thank you. I... I really had a terrific time. Yes, I had a terrific time, too. I, uh... Well, good night. So... Aren't you gonna come in? Um, no. Oh. Well, I mean, I'd really love to, but I, uh, I can't. You sure? Yes. Goodnight. Bill. Willie, are you all right? What is it? I'm fine. I just think that, uh, I had too much to drink. Oh. Would you like to stay here for a while? No, really. I'm... I'm fine. I'll, uh, see you tomorrow. Good night. How are you doing? Fine, actually. Um, as you could tell from last night, I'm not much of a drinker. Hmm. Well, maybe tonight we could just take it easy. But when can I expect you? Because I have to time the soufflé to the exact minute. Otherwise, we end up with spinach pancakes. Oh, absolutely crucial. Right. We should synchronize our watches then. Oh, I forgot my watch this morning, but I think it's about 5:15 'cause I just saw Morris go down to Central Cash. You can tell what time it is from what time he goes to Central Cash? Yes. He always goes to Central Cast at 5:15. Oh, he does? Mmm-hmm. That's when the Coastal Racing Corporation money comes in. He says the cash makes him nervous. But personally, I just think he's just got a crush on one of the cashiers. How 'bout 7:30? Fine. That would be... Oh, actually, you know, eight would be better. Eight it is. Working late, sir? Well, somebody has to. How's the game going? They're up by six in the third quarter. I'll tell you what. I'll wager five dollars that they've blown it by the time I get back down. You're on. Wait. Hey, Morris, what do you know? According to my wife and kids, nothing. Hey, listen, if you see Mr. Sadler up there, tell him his team just went down by 12. I'll be waiting for my money. Oh, yeah, Tony. I'll... I'll do that. Thanks. My, my, my, Mr. Sadler. I've never known an auditor to be so conscientious. Good Lord, Morris, you scared me to death. Working overtime? Well, actually, you know, the banking systems have become so complicated, but the boss still gives us the same amount to get the job done. Yeah. That's a... That's a shame. Yes, it is, it is. Why are you working so late? Oh... My work is never done. I guess that makes us both crazy. I... I tell you what. Why don't we go across the street and grab a couple of beers and sing some Temptations? Um, actually, I can't. I've got a few things to clean up before I leave tonight. But, uh, maybe next time. That's too bad. You know, it's so difficult to sing those songs without a lead vocalist. Yeah. Uh, well, goodnight. Right you are. Cheerio. Yeah, Chief, it's me. Listen, we got to talk. Meet me at Chez Bavone in 20 minutes. Uh-huh. Great. Willie? Willie, I know it's you. Come on. Willie! What are you doing, Chief? Morris is talking the drug money and slipping it into the account with the track money. It's all cash. The only evidence of what's going on is that the cash machine account don't match the deposit slips. All the records go straight to Morris and then he alters them. Hmm. Hello, my friends. The special this evening is poached salmon stuffed with crab and topped with sherry cream sauce that will make you cry for joy. I'm sorry. I cannot stay. I'm here to see my friend. However, the salmon sounds fantastic. Perhaps next time. There is a 10 dollar minimum per table. But I'm not staying. I'll have the steak. Well done. Please. Thank you. Anyway, Morris alters the cash accounts to match the deposit slip. Then the drug money is credited to another account. Amalgam Allied. Willie! What? You all right? Yeah, I'm fine. And then the dirty money gets put in the bank in Estonia. And no paper trail. Um, right. So... What? Morris is our guy? Is that what you're saying? Nah. I mean, he's the one pushing the buttons, but he's not making the decisions. He's not exactly upper management material. So, who do you think's behind him? I don't know yet. But if I find out, you can bet that the next step is Cortessi. Where're you going? I've been here too long. I got to go. All right. Um... You sure you're all right? Yeah, I'm great. I'm fine. Okay. Keep in touch. Yeah, you too. All right, you take care, Matt. Matt. Sadler is definitely not an auditor. Which doesn't leave us too many other choices. Mr. Steinfeld, most problems have very simple solutions. The original plan was foolproof. It still is. What about Ms. Hallman? They've been seeing quite a lot of each other. What if she's working with him? She knows nothing about this. She can't hurt us. It's ironic, don't you think? Our dealings with Mr. Cortessi have become so similar to the situation which brought us to him in the first place. Sound ventures brought to decay by unstable conditions. Conditions impossible to predict. Perhaps there might be a better time to discuss how ironic this has become. Morris, go home. I'll take care of Sadler. You will be protected. Come on. What say you and I finally have that beer, Morris? Come on. I'm buying. Just a second. I'm coming. Jason! Hello, Jill. What are you doing here? Well, I thought we could talk a little bit more. Jason, please, this is not a good time. Well, I can see that. Isn't it a little late for dinner? It's none of your business. What happens in my apartment is my business. Sorry. No, you're not. And you're absolutely right. What happens in your apartment is your business. I've invited a man over, hoping we'll have a quick dinner and if all goes well, we'll make love. Is there anything else you'd like to know? Get out. You are making a very big mistake! Well, it' certainly won't be my first one, will it? And, by the way, I'll be moving out, if that'll be convenient for you! It doesn't matter. It matters. To me. You're gonna insult me if you don't have a drink, Moe. Come on! One beer. Yeah, that's better, huh? I want you to talk to me about Jason Ainsley. Please... I can't do that. Moe, Moe, Moe. These kinds of conversations are so useless. What do you save by not talking? You're afraid you're gonna die, right? Hell, that's a given. These guys you work for are probably gonna kill you before the sun comes up. Why worry about that now? You got to get by me first. I'm gonna blow your brains out unless you start talking right now! Oh, my God, please don't! Don't do that. What do you want? Wow. That move always worked so well for me. It's so theatrical. Of course, the gun helps. You almost wet your pants there, didn't you, Moe? What do you want? I want you to help me, Moe. I know who you work for. I want them. Hell, you're a liability now. Now much future in that. Is there now? I never thought it would go this far. Nobody ever does, Moe. My worst nightmare come true. A phone call from you at three in the morning. Did I get you that robe? No. Are you telling me this couldn't wait till tomorrow? Ah, I figured it was time you started earning that retainer the government's paying you. You're a pain in the ass, you know that, Gianni? Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. I got a guy out in the field. I think he's having a nervous breakdown. Come on in. Got any coffee? Nope. He goes in and out of characters like he's Robin Williams. I'm not even sure he's aware of it when it's happening. I mean, it's like an out of body thing. You know, I'm shooting in the dark here. But it... It sounds like... Borderline or As if Personality. People with this disorder have a sense of self that's so shallow that they can become whoever they're with. And what would trigger it? A traumatic event usually brings it to the surface. After that, anything could trigger it. Tell me about the behavior patterns. It all depends on the severity. As ifs are great mimics. Under control, I can see how it would make him a hell of an agent. Allow him to fit in wherever he wanted. I think I'm more interested in what he's like when he's out of control. If he is in the throes of a breakdown, he could lose whatever shred of self he has left. Essentially, there would be no more Willie Serling. He'd have no personality of his own. How do I help him? Get him to open up. Establish a real relationship. That's a step in the right direction. He's closed himself off from the world. He needs to let someone in. If he loses himself completely, it's... Likely you'll never get him back. I knew you'd come. Come on, Willie. Come on. Right here. It'll make you feel better. I'm telling you, Langston, we don't bring him in now, we're gonna lose him. This guy is working without a net. Come on, Matt. I mean, you ever know an agent who didn't get wound up a little too tight once in a while? I mean, he's close. He knows it. Let him run with it. I'm not talking about male menopause here, all right? He's not healthy. You leave him under, you not only jeopardize this whole case, but you may get to write his epitaph! All right. Okay. Maybe you're right. I'll take the next flight out. I'll be at your office late this afternoon. All right. But listen, pulling him out will not be that easy. I know. I'll see you when you get here. If you want, you can stay wherever you are and I'll meet you there. Hi. Hi. Are you meditating? No. I'm just taking a break. Look, I'm sorry about last night. I got hung up. Okay. I would be willing to try again. That way, I could get even by serving leftovers. I'd like that. Um, just not tonight. What about tomorrow night? I can't. I've got a lot of things I have to do. You know what? Forget it. Well, I wish... Whatever it is, I wish you felt like you could talk to me. But I wish... We could talk. Sadler. Yeah. I'll be right there. When the bottom fell out of the Junk Bond market, we needed a little extra cash to shore up our balance sheet. Keep the regulators out. Jason offered to clean Cortessi's drug money in exchange for a little short-term investment capital. Yeah, but you're the one who's fingerprints are all over the dirty money. You're the one who goes down if the whole thing blows up. Ainsley's totally insulated. Oh, Moe... Cortessi gets to build a world empire. Ainsley saves his reputation, keeps himself out of jail, someday runs for mayor. What do you get? A new couch? Tickets to the Clippers games? You got to learn how to cut a better deal for yourself, pal. Now, lucky for you, I'm an honest man. And the deal I'm gonna offer you is a good one. What is it? You wear a wire and have a little chat with Jason Ainsley. In return, you get to sing harmonies with something other than an all-male chorus. Who, by the way have some very interesting techniques on how to make you hit the high notes. Now, I'm just guessing, but, uh, I don't think a good-looking man like you is too interested in the prison musical scene. So, if we have a deal, I wonder if you wouldn't mind showing me how you move the money in and out of Estonia. I don't wanna scare anybody off. Have somebody keep an eye on Morris till I get the wiretap set. Willie, I wanna meet again. Uh, what for, Matthew? You enjoy trying to pick me out of a crowd? Listen, Willie, no bullshit, all right? No disguises. I wanna meet somewhere. Sorry, Chief. Have your person call my person. I got a busy schedule. Maybe we can work something out for next week, huh? Willie, please. Oh, and Chief, uh, whoever you get to watch Morris, make sure they're good. I'm beginning to like that little guy. I've got a job for you. What are you doing, Gianni, racking up that government overtime? What'd you do? Ride your bike? Yeah. I had a couple of delays. Could've called. You're starting to sound like my wife. You got any coffee? Help yourself. We could've done this on the phone, you know. It's real simple. Pull Willie out, or I'm going over your head. You know, you make me laugh. Everything's so simple to you, Gianni, so clear-cut. You wanna pick up the phone, go ahead. You think it was my call? That's very flattering. It's no longer our decision. It's the CIA's. What the hell are you talking about? They have proof that Cortessi's been selling sophisticated military weapons to third world nations. He's an A1 priority. When did the CIA find out that I was onto Cortessi? Oh, they knew before you did. Why do you think we gave you Willie? What are you saying? That Willie knew about Cortessi all along? That's right. That's why he took the case. He's been hunting for Cortessi for three years now. Nobody knows him like Willie. Cortessi was the trigger man on Willie's wife and kid. You're just a surprise a minute, aren't you, Stu? Do you assholes have any idea what you're doing to this guy? All right, look, as long as he's making progress on the case, he stays in. That's the way they want it. He's the best man for the job. Besides, I told you it is not our responsibility. You're a good little boy, aren't you, Stu? Don't forget to wash your hands on the way out. You listen to me, Matty. You just do your job, and you don't get in the way. This is bigger than you. I'm here. Hi. Uh... Can you meet me at, uh, Griffith Park near the Observatory in about an hour? Is everything all right, Morris? Yeah, yeah. I just got a call from Ainsley. I need to talk to you. All right, I'll be there in 45 minutes. Okay. Thank you. ♪ I'm gonna let it shine I'm gonna let it shine ♪ I'm gonna let it shine ♪ This little light of mine I'm gonna let it shine ♪ Hey, old man. Get outta here. I don't recall giving your ass permission to come into my bedroom, my man. I said get your ass outta here, nigger. Y'all said the magic word, my man. I'm history, baby. I'm gone. Gone. Long gone. Yeah, yeah. Y'all have a good evening', man. Mmm-hmm. You best be watching who you call nigger, Chief. Get your ragged white ass outta my chair! Easy now. There's no gun here. All right? You understand? No weapon. If you're gonna make yourself comfortable in my apartment, you best be parking your car in a place where I can see it when I come up. I could clean blow your head off. You know, you really should learn to chill out, Chief. Willie? That's you? It's just make-up. What brings you here so late? Man, you scared me half to death. We got to talk, Willie. You bet we do. Morris set me up. What do you mean? Somebody tried to take me out. Morris is either dead... Or he's jumped sides. That's not possible. We've got him under 24 hour surveillance. You talk to your guy lately? I talked with Langston, Willie. He told me all about the operation. Oh, yeah? So you and Stuey had a good, long talk, huh? Well, that's good. He should have brought you in from the beginning. But they just love all that clandestine bullshit. I know about you and Cortessi. Oh, yeah? What do you know? I know that they're hanging you out to dry by your balls. They figure that hatred you got burning inside's gonna lead you to Cortessi. I think it's killing you. Yeah, well, if only we knew what we think we know. You gotta come in. I talked with a psychiatrist. You need help. There you go, you see? And to think there were people out there that don't appreciate how much you care. Listen to me, damn it. Leading them to Cortessi is not gonna bring your family back. You still don't get it, do you? They don't want me to lead to Cortessi. I'm gonna kill him. They want him dead. He's been working for the CIA. He's about to become an embarrassment. They've been using him to supply weapons to governments that the CIA supports and the United States government doesn't officially. Unfortunately, he's forged a few little friendships of his own. CIA can't handle him anymore. And then you stumble on his drug operation. Do you think they're gonna let your bring him in, stand trial? Don't let them use you like this, Willie. Look at you, you're completely out of control. There's one thing you ought to understand, Chief. I don't work for them. I work for me. When I kill Cortessi... It's for me. If you get in my way, I'll kill you. What about the people you leave behind, Willie? What happens to them? You're late, Mr. Ainsley. Fashionably, I hope. Of course, if I'd known I had a houseguest. I would have made sure I was home on time. Next time, I'll call ahead. I got your message about some complications. Everything's under control. I just wanted to keep your apprised. When they check the records at the bank, everything's going to stop at Steinfeld's desk. They won't even be able to link it to me. And your money is safe and sound in Estonia. Thoroughness and precision. The keys to any successful endeavor. You've done an outstanding job, Mr. Ainsley. Your reputation is well deserved. What about Sadler, the auditor? That should be taken care of by now. You were hoping to get your girl back, maybe. I'm sorry that we, uh, we had to end our little enterprise so abruptly. But I believe that, uh, most of our objectives were met. It would be my pleasure to do business with you again sometime. Unfortunately, there was no way that these new developments could have been anticipated. There never is. Daddy, where's Mommy? Mommy's right here, sweetheart. That's not Mommy. Bill? Are you all right? Willie, are you all right? Whatever it is, it's all right. Bill? Are you all right? What's wrong? I have to talk to you. Well, come in. What's going on? Bill, you're scaring me. Would you say something? I care about you. I haven't cared about anybody in a long time. I just wanted to be here. What happened to your voice? What the hell is this? I'm not who you think I am. My name is Willie Serling. I'm a Federal Agent. I was placed undercover at your bank to investigate a money laundering organization. I was investigating you. So you're saying this whole thing... Was a lie? You fit the profile. That's what I do. I get close to people. I get them to trust me. Let me in. But it's not me. It's never me. You're really good, aren't you? I let you in. I trusted you. You can't even look at me? Look at me. I'm sorry. I was scheduled to testify on the Grand Jury investigation in... Organized Crime. We, uh... My family... Were supposed to be protected. Cortessi came after me, but... I wasn't there. I remember thinking that if I killed myself as soon as possible, it would be so much easier to catch up with them. Isn't that stupid? I put a service revolver in my mouth and... I started to cry. Not 'cause they were dead. Because I was alive. I didn't have the guts to do anything about it. I'm sorry. Hello? Uh, yeah. It's for you. Gianni? Yeah. How'd you know where I was? Process of elimination. Listen, Willie, we got big problems. Steinfeld's dead. And I lost my best agent. My best friend. You better pick up Jason Ainsley right away. If Cortessi's closing up shop, you can bet he'll be next. Always nice to be in the loop. Just do it now, Chief! I'll meet you there. Yeah. What's going on? We're gonna talk for a long, long time. I'll explain everything to you but just not now. I know you weren't a part of this. I'll come back. Will you wait for me? I will. This thing Willie, I pushed the button on the prison. We're taking it all down. I'm getting warrants right now to freeze all the bank accounts. Give me a little more time. I can still hurt him. Forget about Cortessi, Willie. Let it go. Listen to me, Chief. We're talking about Cortessi's money here. I know how Morris got it out of the country. I can get it back in. Why do I have to be the one to tell you what you're talking about is illegal? You want to be the only one playing by the rules, Chief? Could put a hell of a dent if federal deficit. You get there before we do, I don't know anything about it. This is what we've been waiting for. We flushed him out. That son-of-a-bitch was in this room! What's going on? Where's he going? It's over, Stuey. I ordered the prison to be taken down about 20 minutes ago. What? On who's authority? You stupid jackass! You know how long it took to set up that operation? I know. Oh! Goodbye. You are through, Gianni. Let me see if I got this straight. First it was "Trust me." Now it's "You'll never work in this town again"? What are you gonna do, Stu, huh? You gonna arrest me for busting up the biggest drug operation in the history of the United States? How about interfering with matters of national security? Oh, that's good. Yeah, I'm sure the people at the paper would like to hear about it. I tell you, why don't you stay here and look at the dead guy and I'll go call the press? Go, go, go, go, go! Ooh! Excuse me, ma'am. May I help you? I have a work request. Says I'm supposed to come in here and jack up them 15-Amp circuits in the computer wire room to 30. Uh, may I see it? What's that, ma'am, the circuit? The work request. Oh, you bet, ma'am. Freeze! Freeze! Damn it! Excuse me, ma'am. I must've left it in my office in the basement. It's gonna take me 15 minutes to get it. I ain't got but half an hour to do the job in the first place. Now, Mr. Sadler wants this job done real bad today. Oh. Did Mr. Sadler sign the request? Yes, ma'am. You must be the one he was talking about. Mmm-hmm. The good-looking one, Betty. Oh. Did he say that? Uh-huh. He's such a cutie. Oh, yeah. Look, I'll tell you what. You get started, and bring me the work request later on. Mmm-hmm. You betcha, ma'am. Okay? Sorry, Chief. Drop the stick! Drop the stick! What is this, the FBI? Let me finish my drink here. You can take me now. Hey, Chief, you're late. Still adjusting to West Coast time? I heard you were leaving town. I am. Today. Good. Thanks for everything, Matt. Welcome back, buddy. You hurt Cortessi bad, Willie. Worse than we thought. I mean, I don't know if we're gonna catch this guy, but you hurt him bad. You know, a guy in D.C. tells me he's been seen in six different places in eastern Europe and South America all at the same time. That's what I love about the CIA. So what about her? We don't know. We're gonna talk about it. What the hell's to talk about? You're not blind, certainly not stupid. You're always worrying about me, Chief. I find that very attractive in a man. Get outta here with that. You take it easy, Chief. You know, I almost forgot. I got you a little something when I heard you were staying in California. Thanks, Willie. Don't work too hard. You either, Chief. When in Rome... Where the hell do the Lakers play? Mmm. Which one do you think, that one or that one? Mmm. Neither. We're going to Hawaii. Grab your sandals and we're packed. Oh! We do not have to be outta here in 45 minutes. Ooh. We've got plenty of time. No. We don't. I still have to take a shower, and you have gotta get the to the cleaners. Come on. Oh! It's the place down there on Bryer and Holly. Ah, the plane. Willie, get up! You gonna be all right? Yes, I'll be fine. You know, we could stop there on the way. We could, except that it's in the opposite direction. Oh. Go on, get out of here. Okay, okay. I'll see you in 10 minutes. Willie? Where is he? He's not here. Too bad. Looks like I missed him again. Oh. I forgot my keys.
