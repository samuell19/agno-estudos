Bitch was going the wrong way on the 101. Going the wrong way on the 101. She blew a 2.3! Walked away without a scratch. I'm gonna kill that Chumash bitch. Whoo! Yeah! Here come the Delta Gamma whorepedoes. - Look at those skirts. - They're so beautiful. Seriously. Brought your books? Alright, let's settle down, people. We got a lot to go over before the midterm. OK. This is a Chumash Indian shaman. He believed he was a shape-shifter. He would drink jimson weed tea, which was made from the root of this flower. That shit's fucked up. Well, that'll get you fucked up. Then they would hallucinate. The shaman believed he would shape-shift into a werebear. Which is the great California grizzly. Rrahh! Shh! Alright, Dani. What's going on? You got a problem back there? We're talking about your heritage. I'm only half Chumash. My mom's British. Look. What happened to your people was tragic, OK? It was criminal. Those the Spanish didn't kill with torture and disease, they finished off with guns and bigotry. Doug. Doug. Doug, I got to go. Are you sure? No. No, I got to go. Yeah, I have class. Yeah? Yeah, I have class. Hey, my family's coming in on Sunday. They're driving down. Going to have lunch on State Street. You want to come with us? We'll have mimosas. You won't get carded. Uh... your parents? Yeah. Is that weird? It's a little serious, Doug. Um... Come on. Well, I'll call you later and we'll figure it out. Uh-huh? Alright, go. Alright. Hey, Nathan. Come on in, man. That was a great paper you wrote. Oh, you wanted to see me about your assignment. What's going on? Yeah. Um... Well, my father, see, he owns this property. It's just south of campus. Um... Well, get to the point. What's up? It's a Chumash burial site. The Anderson Rose Ranch? Yeah. That's your family? Jesus! They never let anyone dig up there. Yeah, well, um... So I was thinking of re-creating a brush hut ceremony this weekend. You know, for the assignment. I'd enjoy participating in that. Consider that approved. Grandmother Momoy, I've come to beg for your roots. I promise to do you no harm. I need to borrow your magic for tonight. Cooking up your funny tea there, Benny? I would appreciate it if you would confine yourself to the greenhouse I gave you. And stay out of my business. 'The Quicksand Effect of Depression: 'A Strategy for True Freedom'. To hell with this self-help crap, when I was confused, confused. Confused. Confused. I am the shaman. I am the bear. May Grandmother Momoy take me to the faraway place. What? Stop it! Get away! Ugh! Hello! Don't you see me here? Is everything alright? No, this guy's just riding my ass! What are you looking at, freak? Come on, get out of here! Did you know that guy? No. Are you OK? Yeah. Crazy how fast this coverage came in, huh? Yeah, it was gorgeous earlier. You know, you never told me what it's like getting shot. Knocks the wind out of you. But, hey, you know, it got me discharged. Otherwise... I'd still be over there. You know, all throughout history, most cultures have what they call a... rite of passage ceremony, turning boys into men. I mean, you fought a war. I guess mine is shotgunning beers, trying to get laid and failing miserably at it. Sometimes I just feel like... I'm always gonna be stuck, you know? Never knowing what I'm made of. Nathan, what I think you want... it's not all it's cracked up to be. Want the gak or not? You little fucking tease. Are you fucking for real? Fucking trying to set me up, you little... Relax. Back the fuck away from the gate. Where you going, Benny? To see my fiancée. Fiancée? You? Where is my Ritalin? Mojo! You're always in my purse. Where's my Ritalin? What? Ritalin! What are you on about? I took two. You must have taken the rest. Really? You guys, come on. Those things aren't fucking candy. Alright, now, just chill out, OK? I have engineering midterms. Big deal. “Discuss the elegy in its various forms and the poet's place in society “through a comparison of Khalil Gibran, Percy Shelley or John Milton”? Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck! Fuck! Oh, fuck! I can't catch my breath. I can't breathe. No, I can't. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. She's having a panic attack. I can't breathe. I'm suffocating! No, let me go! I can't... Alright, what do we do? Get her Xanax. Nathan, her Xanax. Call an ambulance! Call an... - I got it, I got it, I got it. - Calm down. Calm down. It's OK. - Here, here, here. - Has this happened before? Just relax. There's nothing to see here! You don't have to be embarrassed, Dani. I mean, it happens to a lot of people. Listen. I've only been living with you guys for a few weeks and y'all treat me like family. Oh, well, welcome, baby. Hey, Dani, uh, about before, giving you a bit of space, I had to do it. Why don't I spark you up a little smokey-smoke? Oh, come on! Wasted! Let's rage! Oh, yeah! Fire up the vacuum cleaner! Go, go, go, go, go! Take that shit. Make that blower your bitch, boy. Man up, son! Get it! Get it! You will do this! You will take it to the face! - Fucking bong of the gods! - You got to hold it! Whoa! Not gonna hurt. Watch. Watch. Watch this. It's not gonna hurt, alright? He's like a mutant. Ready for it, my little Moose? Always and forever. Oh, hey! Hey. Nah, go ahead. Penelope. Oh! Always wanted to fuck a Penelope. Oh, really? Yeah. We're getting naked, right? Deal's a deal, right? Yeah. Dude, what the fuck? Buddy! God, does anyone know how to fucking maintain their alcohol here? “I would rather see my kids die today “still believing in God “than have them grow up under communism. ” You're drooling, bro. I know - it's crazy to think that a girl like that would ever want to miss out on all this here. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Don't discredit these guns, buddy. Come on, knock that shit off. You got to visualise it. You know, you got to see it like it's... like it's already happened. Alright... That was weak, though. That was weak. Somebody wants attention. Dani's a hot mess. Who the fuck is this creeper? He looks like Superman discovering heat vision. Dude! Go turn your crazy-ass stare on somebody else. Shit! Creeper, what are you on? Look at this bastard here. What a weirdo. Babe. Holy fuck. You know what I think he needs? More cowbell. Cowbell. I think he needs more cowbell. Benny? Stranded! Guys, stop! This is my brother, you guys. Party-killer's your fucking bro? Stop drawing on his face, dude. It's not cool, man. Well, dude, he's tripping balls, man. He's totally high! Come on. Benny! Come on! Moose, leave him alone, dude. Benny, what are you doing here, man? What's going on? Benny, look at me. What are you doing here? My bride and I must pass together through the western gate. Beyond that is a bridge we must cross. There are many obstacles to trick us... Stop it! Stop! From getting to the faraway place. That creeper dude, he's whacked. He's whacked. Did you drink it again? Benny, look at me. Did you drink it? He's high on jimson weed tea, guys. Just leave him alone, alright? He's fucking whacked. It's a Chumash thing. Leave him alone. Going home. Benny. Just hang out for a second. Benny! Great. OK, go get him. Does he have any more of that? Benny, come on. Wait. Just hang out, OK? You can't go off like this right now. Benny. OK? We both know it's time. There's nothing left for me here. Benny. Come on, man. No, I mean... Get this shit off your face. Whoa! I love you, Nathan. I love you. But all of this... None of it's real. OK, Benny. I actually agree with you there. Just come back inside for a second. Look at me. I promise I won't let anybody do anything to you again. Oh! Oh, yeah. Oh. You're not gonna drive. Right? Look at me. You're not gonna drive, right? I'm not gonna drive. Ooh! Yeah. Hey, Mojo. That's the spot right there. How you doing tonight? Oh! I'm alright. You, uh... Looking really good. I've got a girlfriend. Are you sure about that? Mm-hm. It's serious and all. You should get off me now. Go on, off you go. Yeah. Lovely girl. Couple of months we've been together. She loves me. Great. How the fuck am I supposed to get home from here? Nathan's brother. Hm. Hey, Benny. How about giving a girl a ride home, huh? You don't mind, do you? I'm just over the highway, right near Carrillo. I love you. You know who you look like? The lead singer of Weezer. Benny? Benny! Fuck. What the hell? Fuck. Oh, my God. Are you OK? Please. Please. I'm so cold. I have to go to the bathroom. How long have you been here? What? You don't remember? I did this to you? Yeah, well... Please let me go. You were... you were so high. It's not your fault, OK? You don't need to do this. Please just... My arms are so... Please. Oh, thank you. Thank you. I promise I won't tell anybody. Why... Why are you stopping? Why are you stop... I swear to God, I won't tell a soul. Do you really? Yes. - I don't want any trouble. I'm sorry. - This is all a big mistake. The last thing I ever want to do is hurt anybody, anybody. This is between you and me. OK, I won't... I won't tell anybody. You're a good guy. You are. I know that. You don't mean it. Just... Ple-please let me go. Please. Please. Please. Please let me go. Please. I won't tell anybody. I won't tell anybody. I love you. You're perfect. Are you starting to feel good, baby? Uh-huh. Oh, yeah. You're such a sweet guy. I get so many rude and gross guys on here, and I just cut 'em off but not you. I love it when you're online. “I can be myself with you. ” You know, it's odd, but I kind of like that I can't see you. Makes me leave it all to my imagination. “Turn around. I want to see you doggie. ” You just want to see my dolphin. Yeah. That's right. I'm thinking about getting more work done on it. What do you think? Dani! Are you OK? Here. I'm sorry. You don't have to be sorry. Come on, let's just get back to bed, huh? Alright, let's go, people! Rise and shine! Let's go! It's a beautiful day! Get up! You got one life to live, everybody! Whoa! OK. Gee! Does nobody knock in this country? Working the morning bone, huh? Is that your webcam princess? She's cute. You know, Mojo, I'm thinking. We should find you a real girl. Are you, um... you seriously still standing there, huh? Do you want to get the fuck out, maybe? Are you crying? Fuck off. Alright? Fuck off! That feels nice. Don't stop. My mom used to do that when I was little. Before she and my dad started telling me I'm such a big disappointment. Guess I proved them right, huh? No. So, listen, I just wanted to... Well, I just wanted to tell you. Dani rages hard. I mean, too fun, too fast. And I know you like her and all. I just don't know if that's the... best fit. You'd think she would have stopped, you know, after the accident. I mean... People died. Yeah. When are we going? Let's go already! Ha! Whoo! What the fuck was up with your creeper brother last night? “My bride and I must pass together through the western gate. ” Like anybody would get within 50 feet of that pervert. OK, alright, guys. Look, Benny is a good guy. He really is. And he's really smart. He used to be a Wall Street trader. He just snapped under the pressure one day and... 'Snapped' is right. And walks into the office naked with feathers and face paint and they fired him. Wow. Then he invents this story about a fiancée and how she left him. I asked him. I was like, “What fiancée? ” And he looked at me like I was crazy. You know, he's just... he's never recovered from that. I'm really afraid he might... kill himself. Now I'm doomed. My whole life is forfeit. I can't let you go now. If I do, you'll certainly go to the police. Police... You look... Native American Indian. Are you, by chance? Here. Does that feel better? My father closed this Rose Ranch years ago. We're the only ones here. Except Delgado, but he... won't bother us. He ran a hardware store. I took him in after he lost his wife and kid a year ago. Now he's just a mess. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You are so... beautiful. You will find me to be a very loving and caring husband. Shh, shh! The cops are out there! Just sit still. Just sit still. Read some Charlie Brown. Shh! Shh! Fuck! Fuck! Shit! Fuck! Another night. Calm down! Don't tell me to calm down! You don't hear 'em? Come on, I fucking hear 'em! They're out there. Stop listening to your brain! It's Radio K-Fuck! You dust buzzard! You know where your own best thinking gets you? I fucking hear 'em, Pancho! Stay out of your head! Listen to me. I ride shotgun. I got your back. Nothing good ever comes from between your ears. Stop smoking gak and get to work! Put the gun down! There's no cops. Everything's OK. You'll be fine! How long you been out here, huh? Hey, don't point that at me, Delgado. And quit cooking without a hazmat suit. It gets in your pores. Jesus Christ, Benny! How many times I tell you? Don't come up here! You want to lose your leg? What the hell is that? Is that a bear trap? When the hell did I say you could booby-trap the place? No! No way. I don't like people sneaking up on me, Benny. I'm moving on. You can have the ranch, at least until my dad figures I'm gone. When are you coming back? I'm not. Hey, hey. That's bullshit, man. Huh? I ain't finished my cook yet. Think I want people sneaking up here asking for your sorry ass? No. You are staying, pal. You really want to take this dance with me? Huh? Into the tunnel of light. You are one creepy motherfucker, Benny. You got some kind of death wish or something. Grandmother Momoy, make this brew strong enough to take my bride and I to the faraway place forever. I haven't even asked my brother if it's cool yet. Come on. He'll be fine when he sees who the naughty professor brought. Oh, Grandmother Momoy. Let me behold your magic light. As the sun fades into beyond on this final day and night... final day and night. Penelope. We try our hardest for life. It braces down. I brought you something I made especially for our wedding. These are Olivella shell beads. Today's the beginning of the Acorn Festival. The Chumash will all be celebrating when we get to the faraway place. OK, OK! I'm so... I'm so thirsty, Benny. Shh! I brought you something very special to drink. No, no. Untie me. I have to go to the bathroom. I don't want to go on myself. Shh. I'm gonna make all your suffering go away. No more pain. No more fear. We'll be done with all that forever. What are you talking about? What's happening? I don't want to go anywhere with you. Hey! Get in! Loser! Get in the car! Make your pain go away. Stop it! Stop it. I can't waste anymore. Fuck you! Fuck! Wait! Wolf man it. Eat the bullet. Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Guys, guys! No open containers. I'm still on probation. Shit! Hart! I'm sorry. It all happened so fast. Wait! Help! Help! Hey, big man. Yo. Do up these windows, man. Let's hotbox this motherfucker right now. Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Wait! Help! Whoa. Uh-uh. What? Did I not just stay up all night writing your fucking paper? If he gets caught with this shit in his piss, he fucking loses his scholarship. Help! Wait! No! No! Penelope. Oh... No, no, don't leave me! No, don't go without me! Don't leave me alone! This wasn't the way it's supposed to happen! Let's go! Move the fuck out the way! This place is sick, Nathan! Oh, my God! This is awesome. It's unreal. - Gonna be a good weekend. - This is amazing! Wow. This is amazing. So beautiful. Unreal. It's not so bad. Look at this place. Hey, Nathan. Is that where they found everything? Yeah. It's a Chumash burial site. My grandfather, he made the bulldozers stop. Told everybody, “Just leave it alone. ” And that brush hut, me and my brother built it. I thought maybe we'd have the ceremony over there tonight. Nice. This place is incredible. A lot of history here. So that's where they're buried? Nathan, you don't mind that I brought my roommates, do you? Hi. I'm Roxanne. Hi. Look at him. Hi. I'm Carly. Hi. Hi. - Nathan doesn't mind at all. - Yeah, no. OK, guys, listen up. Listen up! No beer spills, no bong water, no sex stains... Let's do this! No! Moose! No, no, no, no! My bedroom, guys. This is my bed. Oh, yeah! You want to watch? Guys, seriously. Out, man. This is not happening in my bedroom. Get out! Look, you get out! Come on, baby. Come on. Are you gonna come in or go out? 'Bye. I am not playing around! Oh, great. Get out! How the hell do you already have your shirt off? Really? Is this your bedroom, Nathan? Who's gonna share with you? Oh, Nathan likes the Indian girl. You probably want her to share with you, right? Good luck with that, buddy. The hell, Nathan? This is not OK. You cannot just show up like this! I'm here for a class project and I have just as much right as you do. Not true. I have Father's permission! You can't have strangers over here. And he's entrusted me with overseeing this place, and, besides, I'm dealing with some really heavy shit right now! Why are you freaking out so much? Why is your hair all wet? You been crying, Benny? You need to go, Nathan. Is that blood on your shoes? It was a raccoon. They're pests. OK, just pack up your college friends and get out of here, before I have to... That's Dani. Hi. Olivella shell beads. Chumash. You're Chumash. My father's a direct descendant. His ancestors were Santa Rosa islanders. My mother's British. Were they part of the 1824 revolt against those missionaries and those fucking conquistadors? You know Chumash women had to practise abortion 'cause of what those Spanish bastards did to 'em? Have you relearned your language? Why are you looking at me like that? Yuck. Calm down, calm down. It's just a bunch of fucking kids. Just think about something else. Uh... Charlie Brown, yeah. It's just... A guy trapped in his own insecurities, veiled homosexuality. He's a lovable loser with endless determination and hope. If it'd been me, I certainly would have fucked Lucy. I guess Charlie was too busy sucking Linus's dick, huh? You really think it's a good idea to fuck your therapist? You see this'? What is this'? Probably a raccoon. Then where's the fucking raccoon, huh? Raccoons don't bury their own dead. This looks like it came from a raccoon? Hey, guys. Whoo! Fuck you! Yeah, I got a lot of stuff. Whatever. She's perfect. Careful, babe. Oh, shit. I, uh, forgot my book. I'll be back. - OK. - Coming through, Professor! J' Smash it, bash it, roll it on the floor J' Wrap it around the bedpost, roll it in the door... J' Excuse me. That's my car you're leaning on. Who are you? I'm here with my students. Students? Yeah, we're on a field trip. Do you mind? Field trip? Hey, man, that's my book. You took my book out of the car? What kind of field trip? Look, man, can I just get my book back? Ain't gonna do you any good. Those kids, they all got books. They don't give a fuck about anything. This is private property. Stop listening to your head! Go back and cook the gak! Leave them alone! Hey, boys. We're going au naturel. Tonight's gonna be legendary. Go long! Hi, sexy! Get in the water, you motherfucker! Get in here. Get in here, Professor! Rough night? Little bit. You know, your ancestors played grab-ass in this very same surf. You're amazing. Turn around. I want to see you doggie. I'm thinking about getting more work done on my dolphin. What do you think? - Where the hell's the... - I will splash you. Life isn't fucking perfect. Hey. You OK? Thought you were gonna have more work done on your dolphin. Am I anything like you imagined me? Sandee? Mojo. No shit! Hey, babe. Wait, this is your fucking webcam porno princess? What's he talking about, Tammy? I'm an idiot. What is it exactly you do on the internet? Chill out. It's no big deal. We're paying our way through school. Sure beats working at Starbucks. Wait. You guys are doing porn out of our room? Not on my bed, right? I keep my Bible underneath that pillow. So wait a minute. You're... So you're streaming live internet porn through the Delta Gamma house? Sandee. I shouldn't have said anything. I'm... Sandee? That your porn name or... it's not actual sex. We do it into our laptops. It's not a big deal. And you're the little pervert that's jerking to these girls? - Alright, you know, leave Mojo alone. - Hey! Hey! Nobody came to see Mojo catch heat for stroking it to slutshername and the Delta Gamma whorepedoes over here. Eat my pussy, you midget twinklet chunky angle. What the fuck is a twink? You stupid hooker Barbie sorority skanks. They're fucking dumb! I'm done. This is so stupid. Squirrel... Be nice, alright? Fuck that! So, what's next, Sandee? Do some lap dancing at the Spearmint Rhino? Put up some escort ads on Craigslist? What? I'm not spending the weekend with these stupid whores. Guys! Just come on, stop. What would Jesus do? Jesus wouldn't have you biting each other's titties in the ocean over there. So you can sleep with your students, but yet you condemn me? You're of age, OK? Socrates slept with his students. Oh, Jesus. Except they were all boys. Stop fucking looking at my man's penis, then. Who gives a fuck if I'm creating a porn empire? OK, I'm kicking ass in business and marketing. And the last time that I checked, you couldn't even treat me to a day at Akara on your salary. Que pasa? Pretty great, huh? Jesus-fucking-Christ! I'm out of here. Could you please not use the Lord's name in vain? Fuck the Lord, bitch! She's going to hell. Now I got to deal with this. This is cool. What happened? Look, guys, we can... Squirrel, come on. Come back. Who brought these stupid skanks? Walk your fat ass out of here! Squirrel! I'm not mad about my bed! Hurry up, Moose! I'm fucking trying! If you come back, I'll let you use the bed again. Hey. Hey! What are you doing behind there? Why are you lurking behind the bushes? Hey! Why... What, are you retarded? I'm talking to... Don't you fucking walk away from me! Hey! Hey! I know you. I... I know... I fucking know you. You're the creeper from the party, aren't you? Were you spying on us? - Were you spying on us down there? - I... I... This is... Nathan is my brother. This is my property. You're the weirdo who lives in the bungalow. I heard about you and your imaginary fiancées. Mm-hm. What did you just say? You heard me, weirdo! Were you spying on those sorority skanks down there? Huh? Pervy man looking for his bride, huh? I... I was watching birds. Like fucking hell you were. Just cop to your pervy-ass shit. Were you... were you peeving on the guys? Oh, shit! You're a fucking queer puff, aren't you? You're a fucking queer. You like to touch yourself and look at little boys, you fucking down-low... You be quiet! Hey, asshole! That's my girl you're talking to. Babe! Babe! He's the fucking creeper from the party. I caught him with his hands in his pants. I did not have my hands in my pants! I was birdwatching! - Like hell you were. - Birdwatching?! You liar! - Shut up. - Paedophile! Shut up. Don't you do it. No, no. You know what will happen. No, no, we don't need trouble. Pancho tell you. You go back, you cook. You know what happen. You listen to Pancho. Shut the fuck up! You listen to Pancho! Listen! Shh! Shut up! Leave these kids alone! Don't be a fool! Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. I love you. You're my friend. Hey, dickless. My boyfriend's gonna fuck you up! No, I got it Get him, babe. Get... Who the fuck is that?

Uncle Delgado pitches and you catch. Huh? Right? You fucking used to touch him when you were little, huh? You fucking turned him, didn't you? This family's fucked, babe. Better shut that cunt up or I'm gonna fuck-start her head. What the fuck did you just say to me? Watch your fucking mouth. What the fuck did you just say to me? Get his ass! Please, don't do anything. Pound his ass! You're gonna wish you never... Babe, I got this! Settle down! Fuck! Alright, she's got a big mouth, but she's not fucking kidding.

Get up, Benny! Baby! Moose! Baby, wake up. Are you OK? Fuck! Wake up! Fuck are you on, dude? Moose! My God! Wake up! Great! What are you gonna do, shoot us? Good idea, fucktard. There's only eight more of us coming up the path. That really just happen? What are we gonna do now? - Everybody's just pissed off. - Mojo, you alright? I can't believe her mouth. Damn, Moose and Squirrel are booking out. Moose! Hey! Everything happens for a reason, OK? Can we just go back to having fun? Yeah, that depends on Nathan's internet connection. Alright, Doug, enough. OK? If you keep this up, I'm leaving. Then leave. 'Cause I actually had feelings for you, Tammy. You never told me about any of this shit. OK. Oh! OK, Benny, they're dead. I'll clean up my cook, we get the fuck out of here. No. Suit yourself. I've got a wedding to prepare. You OK? Yeah, I'm OK. I do remember the first time I noticed that I had leg hair. Take me for a ride. I'm just leaving. Where are we going? What would Tammy or Sandee say about that? She's just my roommate. She's not really my friend. Oh, really? You're not friends? You ever been with a redhead before? No, I haven't. Professor! You're not leaving, are you? I actually was leaving, yeah. Come on. It's not even dark yet. I mean, everybody's leaving. Oh, wow. This is priceless. You are Professor-fucking-Nash. Right? You're not gonna leave because of my stoner friend. That's not why I'm leaving. Look, hang out. Look, Professor. It'd really mean a lot to me if you stayed. You see that face? Come on, Professor. Alright. Let's do this ceremony. I'll find you later. Alright, let's do it. Ready? Go talk to her. I'm gonna. Take her for a walk. You know, it's sunset. Girls eat that shit up. Damn! I got voice-mail again. Fuck me. I gotta tear all this shit down. Do it while you can. Come on. Come on, D. You can talk while you take it all down. Play it smart. Hey. Don't you agree? 'Snoopy, Come Home' lacks the clarity and focus that made 'A Boy Named Charlie Brown' so endearing? Oh, no. No, no, stop looking at us. Don't... don't go there. Tear us down. Rip us up. It does you no good! Let it go! Shut up. Shut up! I don't want to hear you anymore! You understand? I don't want to hear anything. I want to feel nothing! Nothing! Don't go there! It's bad juju. I'm gonna kill every last one of those college motherfuckers. Hey, 'Party Harty'. What's your magic number? Going on about? What's your magic number, huh? Oh, you want to play that game? You want to? I want tequila. Sure you want to get into that so soon? If you're not wasted, the day is. Wow, there's a nihilistic T-shirt waiting to happen. Well, my magic number is O. I'm still a virgin, and I'm proud of it. I can fix that. You and your technical virgin thing is such shit. Fingers and tongues count. They so do not count, OK? Do you count anal? How about anything under six inches? You got a ticket last weekend for giving road head, so you can't start judging me. - It was awesome. - Alright, enough! - She's a virgin. Respect your friend. - Thank you. Those little fuckers! Yeah. - Look what I got. - Boom! Boom. Go up and start the ceremony or what? Nathan. That jimson weed? Yeah. Gonna do this right, aren't we? Yep. Game time. I even have a real ceremonial Chumash bowl we dug up right here. Not on my watch, man. I can't let my students drink jimson weed. Sorry, man. Nathan, I've known kids who OD'd and fucking died on that shit. It's toxic. Look, there's no way to figure out what's a fatal dose or what's... Professor, I know what I'm doing. It's too risky, man. What if we just take a little bit? Why don't we go with what we know? Few of these bad boys here, go up to that brush hut, clambake it... We gotta have the tea! I mean, this is the whole problem with our society. We've done away with... with all ritual, with all ceremony. I mean, we just do whatever we want now, on our own, whenever. Do you even know what that stuff can do? The Chumash stopped using jimson weed because it kills. Fucking technology! Cell phones, you little fuckers! Huh! There you are, Steve Jobs. You ain't talking to anybody, kids. Nobody! You know what? Hey. The ceremony, it's... it's still important. There must be some herbal tea up there. Let's make the best of what we've got. We're here. I'm sorry, man. Fuck it. Fuck it. The girl. The girl, the girl, the girl! Where's the girl? Fucking skunk, man! That stinks! Oh, my God, you stink. It's not funny, you stoner A-hole! Come on, come on. We'll get you cleaned up. I'm sorry. That thing totally got me! They're pests. I'm sorry. I effing hate this place! We'll clean you up. I smell so disgusting! You don't even know! I'm gonna smell like this forever. No, it comes off. I smell terrible! I smell absolutely... Yeah, it's... This is the worst smell, like, ever! Oh, my God, it's disgusting! Need any help? I've been skunked! I've been skunked! Oh! There's some antibacterial soap under the sink, if you need it. I'm gonna smell like this forever. I should have stayed at a hotel! I knew it. I shouldn't have come here. I don't even know why! I smell so... Oh, my mom won't let me in the house smelling like this. I don't like skunks. I don't like skunks. I'm sorry for saying this, but, Jesus, why did you make skunks? They smell so bad! Carly? Tea's ready. You almost done? Carly, is everything alright? There's a loofah in there too, if it helps, to get it off. You almost done? OK, well. I'll just meet you back out there, OK? I'm gonna go. This is sage. They used the smoke to purify each other. Pure is boring. All set. So how's Carly doing? Uh... think she's a little pissed off. My gosh, my hair still reeks! My God! My God! Oh, my God! Go away! I think I did that with my mind. The spirit of Grandmother Momoy awaits. Professor, you're the elder. Elder. Ah! Jesus, Nathan. What kind of tea is this? Just tea. Just tea, guys. I swear. That is bitter. What is that? We were out of herbal tea, so it's Lipton's. Need a refill on that. Oh! Goddamnit, Mojo! So sorry, mate. I didn't see it. Now I have to brew a whole 'nother pot! No, no, I'll go make another pot. No, it's alright. Just get the old tequila worm up your bum, everyone's high as a kite. Mescal has the worm, not tequila, you dumb-ass. - It's very funny, alright? - Nathan. It's alright. Don't worry. Can use the tequila. Good substitute. Shaman don't drink tequila. They do tonight. Easy there, killer. Come on. I beamed it out there and, boom, she just hit the glass. Only thing you're doing is fucking up! Shit. Mr... Professor, you... Jesus, look at him. Look at the state of him. He's fucking mashed. You're high as a kite, Professor! Here, Roxanne. You have it. She's fucking mashed too. Look at her. What the fuck are you two smoking? Come on! You're my buddy, Nathan. You are. Guess all this worked out pretty well, huh? Yeah. Too bad Moose and Squirrel took off. Yeah, their loss. Think I should go for it? NATHAN; Hi. Hey. Hey. Come on! Come on! Die already, bitch! Die already! Bitch! What are you doing? What are you doing? She's not the girl! Least you tried to stop me, huh, Benny? You and your fucking death wish! No, no, no, no! Come on! No! Huh? Take a look! Delgado, stop! Stop! Look at her fucking face! She's done. Come on, die. Die! Die! Oh, she's done. Delgado! Stop! Stop! Oh, you didn't have to do that! Now for the rest of 'em. - Nice night for a walk. - You want to go for a walk? Yeah, let's go. Let's go. Rrahh! It's lighter that way. Yeah. It's dark. Where you going, pal? OK. Whiny little bitch! He's my brother! And not the Chumash girl! There's a Chumash girl? Dani. She's my fiancée. Dani? Chumash Dani? From the fucking university. That bitch who killed my wife and son? I don't know anything about that. Fear not. I will fear not. On, shit! Hell of a surprise. Yeah. Did you think it was a werebear? Arggh! It is her. Oh, no! Don't! You promised me you wouldn't go after her. You promised not to revenge me. I didn't go after anybody, Pancho. That bitch came to me. What is a werebear? I don't know. You said it. You OK'? No! No! What the fuck is going on? Are you OK? Oh, my God! OK? Nathan, you stupid ass. You gave them jimson weed? No, no, I didn't! It was... I gave 'em tea. It was regular tea. Stop lying! Look at them. They're all geeked up on jimson weed. - It was tea, I swear! I wouldn't do that. - They're the only ones that had it. We have to get 'em to hospital now! You're OK. You're OK. Come on. OK. Come on. Get up. You got it. You're OK. There you go. Where's Nash? Guys, where's Nash? Professor! Nash! Professor! Professor! Ooh-ooh-ooh! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Tammy, hey. Um... I don't want to lie to you. I'm shitting it. Please don't laugh at me. I just don't... Come on, Mojo. We have to go in. Why don't we just... It's scary! Yeah. Mm-hm. Maybe I'll get lucky. Alright. Just for a little bit. Let's go. Let's get her inside. We'll go back for Nash. Look at me. Look at me. There you go. You're gonna be OK. It's OK. Dude, get a phone. Who the hell took the phone? Oh, crap. I always keep my iPhone right here. And my keys. Who the hell took my keys? Oh, my gosh. C-Carly! Carly! Guys! Guys, get in here. Carly? Look at her head. Carly. Oh, she hit her head. Hart! Are you OK? Shit. There it is. Oh, shit. Who did this to her? Oh, my God. Is she breathing, Hart? No. I don't know. I don't know these people! Did you give her the tea? No, I told you I wouldn't do that! I can't find a pulse. Call an ambulance. Do it now! Get these bugs off of me! Get these bugs off of me! Nobody's got a damn phone? Dump out all the packs! My cell's in the front pocket of my book bag. Get it! Get these bugs off of me! There's nothing here. I can't find anything! Get these bugs off of me! Where is it? Hart! It's not in here, man! It's not in here! Where's all the phones? Where are all the phones?! Somebody must have taken them. Who would do that? Do you see any goddamn phones? Get these off of me! Get 'em off of me! There's nothing on you! Get 'em off of me! Guys! Hey, take her to the bathroom and make her puke! How the hell am I supposed to do that? Stick your fingers down her throat. Are you fucking kidding me? Look! You were drugged... Guys, come help me. Get her up. Look, help me get her up. Let's go. I'm taking these two straight to the emergency. Grab Roxanne. Don't you get it? There's no phones and there's no car keys! Somebody took all of them! - It's OK. No, there's nothing... - Get 'em off! - I'm sorry. - Get these bugs off of me! This is a really stupid idea. Proper explorers. Fucking London dungeons... What's that? Shit! It was small! It wasn't! Look at the fucking size of it! You're such a baby. It was fucking massive. You're being ridic... Give me the light. No, it's mine. Give it to me. I... You know, I... It's kind of embarrassing, but... What? I've never been in a real relationship. Open your mouth, Roxanne. Come on, open it up. Here you go. Drink it. Drink it. Here we go. Get it all up. Come on. Good, good. Get it all out. Is this your brother's sick idea of a joke? I don't know who's doing this! Keep drinking. There you go. It's OK. Oh, Jesus! God! Just get a little in the toilet. I'm going for help. Keep flushing out her system with fresh water. Don't you dare leave us. Just stay put. Do not leave this cottage, no matter what. I'm coming back with help. OK? I promise. Fuck! She's seizing. Come on, Roxanne. Come on! Roxanne, it's OK. Roxanne! Come on! It's OK. I can't breathe!
