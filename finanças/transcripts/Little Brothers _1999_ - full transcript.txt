"Check this dog out, she's so nice..." ﻿They got better things to do. ﻿I bet they do. ﻿Think they gonna take your dog to a fight or sell her somewhere? ﻿Big fella sees 'em, he slaps 'em and grabs her. ﻿Motherfuckers! They're killing me. ﻿The big fellas did it. ﻿Say it out loud and they'll whack you real good. ﻿I don't even know them! ﻿It don't mean they didn't do it. ﻿I gotta find her. ﻿We'll look around tomorrow morning. ﻿I want her now! ﻿It's too dark! ﻿Blame yourself! Why'd you fall asleep? ﻿Where'd you come from, Disneyland? Get outta here! ﻿Dembo! ﻿They stole my dog. ﻿Don't worry. Typical of them little pricks. ﻿They're relentless these days. ﻿Since the screen set up for the soccer cup ﻿was took down, they been torchin' everythin'. ﻿Major rampage! ﻿They even tried to blow up the gym. ﻿We wouldn'a done that at their age. ﻿Where's my dog? ﻿How do I know? Let me ask Mous. ﻿Wake up! ﻿Where's the dog? - How do I know? ﻿- Whaddya mean, "How do I know"? ﻿- Where is it? - I don't know. ﻿- Go find it. - It's too dark. ﻿I don't give a shit. ﻿Move your punk-ass! ﻿Put your sneakers on and go get her. ﻿Now! ﻿Don't come back without her. ﻿Out! ﻿Go back to sleep, we'll know tomorrow. ﻿I'm tired. ﻿Good night. ﻿- I'm gonna get killed. - No, you ain't. ﻿Tell Dembo someone left the door open and the dog went for it. That someone's gonna be me! Tell him the dog was on the loose, ﻿someone saw her and just got an idea. How about we saw guys from some other projects cruisin' by. He'll bust my ass! ﻿Nah, Dembo's cool. Plus, he don't know the girl, he don't give a fuck! He does when shit gets stolen from his crib. ﻿Tell him someone saw guys in a Beamer grab her. ﻿Who's that gonna be? 'Cause whoever saw it's gonna be grilled! ﻿Just say it was a Beamer. ﻿So we all saw a blue Beamer, right? - What model? - A 525. ﻿How many in the Beamer? - Three. - Two Niggas and an A-rab. ﻿Kick the ball. ﻿Stop dribblin! ﻿It's not cool to steal a dog! ﻿- Did someone steal it? - It's all about business here. ﻿I can't believe they stole my dog! - We can look for her together. - Yeah... ﻿Nassim's a thief, you know. Best in the 'hood. ﻿I don't steal from girls! I like 'em too much. I respect 'em. You want anything, just ask him, he'll steal it for you. ﻿I just want my dog! Whoever stole her, I'll kill 'em. ﻿We're lookin'. We'll find her... somehow. ﻿They call you Tyson, on account of your eyes. ﻿You got a killer's eyes. You don't like "Tyson"? ﻿I don't care. ﻿- What's this pit business? - We're just talkin'. - What's that bitch doin' here? - Calm down. ﻿Who stole my dog? ﻿I don't like to be shit on! ﻿Dembo! I gotta talk to you. ﻿Stash this for me. ﻿Yeah, you better get outta here. ﻿We can't alert the whole projects for your dog. ﻿I ain't goin'! ﻿Maybe the little fellas did it, or maybe some other guys. ﻿Your brother's gonna rape her, can see it comin'. ﻿l was at your place! ﻿So she left! Your solid gold bitch buzzed offs! ﻿They steal from your crib and you say nothin'? ﻿You sleep, you don't give a shit and that's it? ﻿So the kids run the joint? ﻿Yeah, they grow up fast these days. ﻿Dembo! I need a small weapon. ﻿Like what? ﻿A gun. Now that I don't have my dog to protect me. ﻿A gat? Why not a machine gun? If you're loaded, go to Guns 'R' Us. They even have rocket-launchers. ﻿- That's not funny! - If you know how to use 'em. - Word. -He's pissin' on her. She's just a kid. - Some small gats even shoot lead. - It's not funny! I don' want a toy! ﻿You can do some damage with a Derringer. ﻿Smoke the fucker up close, he's gone! ﻿Keep laughin'. ﻿You heard what she said? She want a real gun. She's nuts. ﻿What's a Derringer ? ﻿It's a real piece. And if you get it in the face... ﻿You saw Nourdine's brother? ﻿It's not a real gat... but close. ﻿No way we'd get one. ﻿They don't come cheap. ﻿I need to protect myself. ﻿We'll protect you. We friends, right? ﻿Yeah, but... How much is a small Derringer? ﻿I dunno. We don't have that kind of thing. ﻿Little fellas carry guns, they stupid! ﻿It ain't just the paper. ﻿- I want one. - How about a kiss? ﻿- There you go again. - Just a little kiss. ﻿You don't deserve it yet. ﻿- And if I find a gat? - How? ﻿Some big fellas give me weed to give to other guys. ﻿I ferry the shit and they pay me. ﻿Depends on how much I carry. ﻿You deliver all over the projects, you can make crazy paper. ﻿Try and find my dog first, instead of comin' on to me. I'm only thinkin' about your dog. ﻿- You want me to go home, I'm gone. - Go! ﻿You're just an asshole. ﻿Stop dissin' me and let's check out the other projects. Or I'll go alone. ﻿I'm sick of bein' ragged on. All I worry about is my sister and Kim. ﻿Who'd harm them? ﻿How do I know? I don't know who stole her. ﻿She gets hit, I get hit. I'm entitled to flip out! ﻿I understand. ﻿I miss Kim a whole lot. ﻿How about we go look around for her? ﻿Let's go. ﻿You seen a small white pit with a brown spot on her eye? ﻿- Ain't got no pit here. - Get lost. ﻿You seen a small white pit with a brown spot? ﻿No. Who are you? ﻿Go play with your marbles. ﻿- Go look in the park. - Or on Gramont Street. It's over. I'll never find my dog. ﻿The big fellas have gone to check out another area. ﻿They don't care, it's not their dog. ﻿Might as well be. ﻿Whoever did it couldn' a known whose dog it was. - I ain't holdin' my breath. - You gotta. ﻿Can't even report it, I'm a runaway... ﻿Cops don't give a shit. An old ﻿lady's poodle gets chewed up, then they care. ﻿And they'd be shocked ﻿if we called 'em for help. ﻿Don't worry, we'll find your dog. ﻿Go buy me a large Coke over there. ﻿Don't keep me waitin'! ﻿- You got robbed again? - Not since last time. ﻿He still wears a Chirac mask? ﻿Yeah. I'm gonna close the store down. ﻿Where we gonna shop, then? The supermarket's too far. ﻿You think if it's the same guy? ﻿As far as I know, there's only one Chirac. ﻿Didn't I tell Tyson you was the best thief in the 'hood? ﻿I took this for the dog, not for the girl. ﻿Run! ﻿What's happenin'? ﻿What's up, Rachid? ﻿She's beautiful, ain't she? She's gonna make mad cream. ﻿I kinda like that girl. ﻿We ain't backin' out. ﻿Did I say we was? ﻿You wanna give it back? ﻿He's trippin'. ﻿Lay off! ﻿When you're soft, you're soft. ﻿I ain't pullin' out. ﻿But you wanna give it back to her. ﻿- What if your dog got swiped? - Ain't got no dog. ﻿A dog's a slave. It's a slave, right? ﻿They obey us. ﻿Well, Tyson's her dog's slave. She's the slave of a slave. ﻿So? ﻿So the girl's a slave. ﻿Quiet! ﻿Dembo thinks we did it. He's scopin' out all the basements. ﻿Better move that dog on the DL. ﻿- Where can we hide her? - We'll see tonight. ﻿She's not a hamster, y'know. ﻿We can kiss that pit goodbye. ﻿Them cats would know how to deal with her. Word. ﻿We'll get a cut. Small, but... ﻿I ain't gettin' involved. ﻿Rachid'll go see David or Momo. ﻿Why me? ﻿Tyson's gotta be lured away while we do this. ﻿Iliès can take care of that. ﻿- Anthony! - How ya doin'? ﻿Got something to ask you. A small gat. It's not for me... ﻿A gat? You fuckin' brat. For you? ﻿Well... ﻿I've known ya forever, ﻿and I know your brother. Why would I sell ya a gat? ﻿Chill, man, I'm just askin'! Don't get all worked up! ﻿I don't want ya to screw me over. ﻿Why would I do that? ﻿Cops catch ya, you'll rat on me. ﻿No, I won't. ﻿Fuckin' booty-scratcher, asking me for a gat! ﻿Chill. It's just between you and me. ﻿You sure ya ain't gonna rat on me ? ﻿Unless you do. ﻿Whaddya mean...? Okay, wait. ﻿How 'bout the shells? ﻿Who says I'm gonna bounce it to ya? How much ya got? ﻿Four one-hundred bills. ﻿Add one more. ﻿- How about the shells? - Give ya ten. ﻿- Only ten. - Deal. ﻿Thanks, Anthony, that's great. ﻿- 500 by tonight. - Be right back. ﻿Later. ﻿Yo, Baba! ﻿Nice bike, how's it handlin'? - Thinkin' of buyin' the same one. - It's a dope bike. ﻿Can I try it? - You gonna jack me for it. - Nah... ﻿Come on, Iliès! ﻿Check out the girl. ﻿Go, go! ﻿Gimme your bike! ﻿Get down. ﻿Let go of me! ﻿Get lost! ﻿Wanna buy a small bike? ﻿Look at it, it's dope. ﻿I ain't buyin'. Leave me alone. How much you think I'm gonna sell it to you? - How much d'ya want? - 300. ﻿Too much. ﻿300's too much? It's a VTT! Where d'ya get it? ﻿My dad don't want it no more. I mean, it was mine but he said, Get rid of it. Bottom line? ﻿Give ya 200. Take it or leave it. You lucky I know you. ﻿I'm scared! ﻿Can I do it? ﻿My turn! ﻿Then me, then you. ﻿I can't. ﻿Quick! ﻿You gonna crush me! Careful! ﻿I'll tell you when I'm ready. ﻿Hurry. ﻿I can't. I ain't there yet. ﻿I got you what you wanted. ﻿An older guy swiped it for me. Hide it. ﻿Chill! ﻿Nobody can see it. It's between you and me. ﻿You get arrested, you don't know me. I ain't no gangster. ﻿I did it for you. Cost 500, which is a shitload. ﻿Thank you. ﻿And it's dangerous. ﻿Can we try it? ﻿Let's go by the Fort. See how small the bullets are? ﻿Hi, guys. ﻿Cool. ﻿Wha's up? ﻿Wha's her name? ﻿If you make some cream with us, don't forget us. ﻿Hey, we ain't no thugs. ﻿We gotta go. Later... ﻿Oh, you found her, we didn't. ﻿Don't worry. ﻿You know what, Karim? ﻿Them little pricks took us for a ride. ﻿This ain't no dog, this is a pet. ﻿What's this pit mixed with? ﻿Wanna get her workin'? Let's chip in, thousand each. ﻿Max. ﻿She's good for four or five fights. ﻿Be dead before that. ﻿Where you takin' me? ﻿Shut up and follow me. ﻿I don't know how to aim. I'll teach you. ﻿Will it hold? ﻿Where we gonna shoot from? See? You load it, you push the safety up, You do this, you shoot. Like Pacino. Stylish. That's stylish? ﻿Your turn. ﻿Wait. ﻿That's good. For a first time, that's good. ﻿It's the wind! ﻿I got it! ﻿You shot 20 years too late. ﻿You did, too. You're weak! It's so loud! ﻿You hold it like this. ﻿"Gimme your 300 or I'll smoke ya, mother fuker!" ﻿They can't wait to give 'em to you. ﻿Hi, David. ﻿Wha's up, Karim? ﻿- Mohammed... - Cool. ﻿- Whose dog is that? - Ours. ﻿Really... ﻿Can we test her against yours? ﻿Against my dog? Forget it. ﻿You pussy! ﻿Too many scars, forget it. ﻿You can't turn down a quickie. ﻿Your dog's gonna eat her alive. ﻿Stop yappin', let's go test her. ﻿If she goes, she goes. We didn't buy her to cuddle. ﻿Five minutes, then. ﻿Get outta here! Make that 20. ﻿Plus a couple of bills. ﻿Big ones, then. But my dog's gonna cut her up. ﻿- Two g's? - Deal. ﻿- Sure? - I'm down for it. ﻿Tonight then. ﻿That don't mean we're hooked up. ﻿Ever been out with a guy? ﻿You kiddin' me? Once I went out with two guys at once. See ? ﻿See what? ﻿Whatever you wanna see. ﻿Like, you won't go out with me. ﻿You got your kiss, which means I gave it to you, nobody else. ﻿I could've. ﻿To Nassim? ﻿I dunno, he's cute. ﻿I see you kiss anybody else, you're out of the projects! ﻿Leave me alone now, I'm thinking of my dog. ﻿We'll find her, don't worry. ﻿Ludmilla! ﻿Talia! ﻿Long time! ﻿- You okay? - Yeah. ﻿Where were you? You disappeared. ﻿My stepfather's back. ﻿Oh, great... ﻿- How's Kim? - She was stolen. ﻿Apart from that, everythin's fine? ﻿I'm in no mood to play. ﻿- So where you gonna stay? - Not with him, that's for sure. ﻿I know I'm buggin' you, but are you sure, about my stepdad? ﻿I don't wanna talk about it. ﻿Even if I ask you to? ﻿You'd be asking a lot. It was a year ago. ﻿Do it for you, do it for me, do it for my sister. ﻿There's gonna be too many problems. ﻿If you don't, you're a real bitch. ﻿I promise you. Do it for you, for my sister. ﻿There's gonna be too many problems. ﻿People will talk. ﻿Please do it. ﻿Okay. ﻿- If I go back, I'll smoke him. - We'll do it together. ﻿I'm gonna see my sister. Call you tonight. ﻿Ever heard of flying wings? ﻿What do you need to fly? ﻿One: a carrying surface. ﻿The wing. ﻿Two: an engine. Three: controls, to fly it. ﻿So you don't need no fuselage, you don't need no tail. ﻿A Frenchman invented that. You don't give a shit, do you? ﻿Ever heard of Stealth planes? ﻿I don't give a shit! ﻿I'm not surprised, you're too stupid. ﻿Nothing interests you. ﻿Cut it out! ﻿You cut it out, kiddo. ﻿I don't want to see you around my sister. ﻿You gonna teach me how to raise my kid? ﻿You wanna teach me about life? ﻿I came to change and see my sister. ﻿Don't try and set her up ﻿against me. ﻿Can I change without you on my ass? ﻿Leave us. ﻿Don't go near him. Don't let him kiss you. ﻿- He's my dad! - I know he is. ﻿But don't get into his bed if he asks you, okay? ﻿Fathers don't do this.

What have been blabbing about? ﻿Don't you know what he's done to Ludmilla? ﻿She picked it up on TV. ﻿Otherwise, she woulda told me. He just cheered her up. ﻿He sure did. But if he touches my sister... ﻿- Why would he? - You always keep your eyes shut. ﻿He brings his paycheck home and he raised you. Don't forget that. ﻿Ludmilla's lying. Got any proof he's a rapist? ﻿If he stays home, I'm gone. ﻿Do your shit, he'll go to jail, you'll go to a foster home. ﻿Is that what you want? ﻿You can find your dog. ﻿Some guys are selling one. Cheap. - About a thou. - A thousand? ﻿I'll blow their heads off! ﻿They're not little motherfuckers like you. ﻿- Say that again! - Motherfucker. ﻿You're fucked if you act like a fuckin' bitch! ﻿Can y'get the thou? ﻿I don't have it. ﻿- Fine, I'll go tell 'em. - I'll get it. ﻿At 50 francs a blow job, shouldn't take you too long. ﻿Wash your mouth. ﻿Mine, you'll do for free, and thank me. ﻿Yeah, sure, fuck off. ﻿I was attacked by a little fella.

It ain't fun bein' broke. ﻿When I grow up, if I don't find a job, I'm gonna sell drugs. ﻿Everythin' under the sun, except heroin and cocaine. ﻿Then I'll find a nice family house, paint it all kinds of colors. ﻿The man won't even recognize it. ﻿When I grow up, ﻿I'm gonna get myself a big car and a small pit. ﻿Then I'm gonna push 'im till he cries "Mama!" ﻿When I'm 18, I ain't gonna go back home. ﻿I'm gonna steal cars, paint 'em like limos, ﻿go tell the man: "Nice car, buy it." ﻿"Give you a good deal". He buys it, I steal it, ﻿then I take it and drive it, pedal to the metal! ﻿Push it to the max! ﻿Then when the pigs breathe down my neck, I sell it. ﻿I'll get me your basic BMW, convertible, dark blue. ﻿I'll get me a Ferrari! ﻿Ferrari? They'll sure catch you and put you in the hole. ﻿If I go to jail, I write ﻿If I go to jail, I'll write to my wife and kids ﻿I'm fine and comin' out soon... Wife and kids, right. ﻿Then I escape and tell my kid, "You take over." ﻿He's gonna follow my footsteps. ﻿Then I'll tell him, "Go steal some donuts." And he will, and he'll say, "I did it, dad!" ﻿Then I'll say, "Go get some clothes." ﻿And he'll do the same with his kids. ﻿"Take over, carry on." It'll never stop. ﻿I don't see myself gettin' a job. Maybe later... ﻿Who knows? ﻿Maybe you wanna work like a dog. I don't. ﻿I'll steal and rob and I'll be fine. ﻿And how you gonna get your Beamer? ﻿In a snap. ﻿Man, how she shook that tire. ﻿and tore those jeans! That bitch's a killer! It's Nassim.

Go tell her we'll give it back to her. ﻿- When? - Tomorrow, day after... ﻿Couple more days, she'll get it back. ﻿- When? - Coupla days. ﻿Now buzz off! Let go of her! Scram! ﻿One or two more fights, ﻿we take the thou and she can go fuck herself. And her dog. ﻿So? ﻿It works. Tomorrow, day after, for sure. ﻿Not sure at all. ﻿They swore it on the Koran. ﻿They're gonna kill her. ﻿When I told 'em about the paper, they were ecstatic. ﻿Then they hesitated. Not to worry, they're addicted to cream. ﻿I'll tell her tomorrow, otherwise she'll kill me. ﻿When I told him about the thou, he was like... ﻿I got good news for you. ﻿Kim? ﻿- We'll get her soon. - When? ﻿They just couldn't come today. ﻿That's what he told me. ﻿Give him the money, you'll get the dog. Ain't you happy? ﻿And you never saw him before, right? ﻿- He's not from 'round here. - Sure! ﻿Big fellas ain't small time. ﻿They're busy. You're not happy? ﻿I will be when I get my dog! ﻿I love wedding dresses! ﻿I'd kill to see myself in one. ﻿Last year, I was still tiny, ﻿I walked into a wedding joint and said: "Can I try a dress on?" ﻿They laughed at me. ﻿"You're too young to get married." ﻿"It's not for me, ﻿"it's for my big sister." ﻿"She a dwarf or somethin'?" ﻿Then they kicked me out. I was that small. ﻿I've grown up. ﻿What was the dress like? ﻿It was beautiful! ﻿Very long, with a huge petticoat. All veil. ﻿And this here was like this, with sleeves up to here. ﻿And white gloves, long white gloves. ﻿Just thinkin' about it gives me goose bumps. ﻿- You wanted to buy it? - I didn't say that. ﻿Just try it on. ﻿And I'd love to see how I'd look in a black dress. ﻿You'll wear black at your wedding? ﻿I didn't say that... ﻿You thought of it? ﻿Whoah! You see me in a black dress? ﻿No, but you do. ﻿All you see is black, you licorice. ﻿- Just try it on. - Put it right. ﻿The veil. We'll uncover your face. ﻿I love dresses. ﻿Truck comin'! Right here! ﻿C'mon! Help me unload! ﻿Who's the driver? ﻿Who's he? ﻿Dembo, look! ﻿- David! - Greedy little shits! ﻿How does he do it? He never gets caught. ﻿Mamadou! Hey, you shits! ﻿- Take some more! - There's tons of stuff! Go! ﻿Pigs! ﻿This way! ﻿Get him! ﻿Nail 'im to the ground! ﻿I didn't do it! ﻿- Who's that? - Guy from the 'hood. ﻿You're hurtin' me! I didn't do it! Let go of me! ﻿- I'm gonna get 'em! - Stay here! ﻿I'm gonna catch you! ﻿What's goin' on? ﻿Total it! ﻿What the hell did you do? ﻿Quick, uncuff me. ﻿Just came out of Unemployment. Thousands of ads, but no job. ﻿Then I came out. ﻿The guy left the engine running, l nicked his truck. Normal. ﻿Why did he let you? ﻿He was unloading. ﻿Take 'em off! ﻿Don't move. ﻿Go see if the pigs are still here. ﻿Go see if they went to Coco's. ﻿Motherfuckers, they fucked me! ﻿All clear. ﻿Get the pliers. ﻿Whatcha laughin' at? ﻿Maybe they arrested him. ﻿Maybe right now he's at the precinct gettin' beaten up. ﻿I'd rather go to jail than remain in custody. ﻿At least you get a yard, and tv, ﻿and plenty of food. ﻿My dealer pals always carry a thou, case they get caught. ﻿Cops ain't gonna feed you. ﻿You got money, you can get sausage and fries. ﻿No pig meat, though, they'll think you're dissin' 'em. ﻿That shit makes you thirsty. ﻿They always beat you up at the precinct. ﻿You don't talk, they beat you up. You talk, they beat you up. ﻿They beat you up, period. ﻿How do they do it? ﻿They slap you, they punch you, they kick you... ﻿Sometimes they use tear gas. ﻿- File a complaint! - For what? ﻿You know the scar on my leg ? ﻿I fell off a bike. ﻿Right in front of the hospital. ﻿EMS was ready to take me in, cops said no. ﻿They said the bike was stolen. ﻿They beat me up, took me to the precinct, ﻿I complained. Nothing. ﻿Mous not back yet? ﻿I'm gonna crash. ﻿Good night. ﻿Turn the light off on your way out. ﻿Iliès. ﻿Come here. ﻿Whassup, Karim? ﻿It's the dog. She croaked. ﻿You gotta bury her. ﻿She's useless. She wasn't much use anyway. ﻿Where'd you bury her? ﻿She's up in the tower. You take her and bury her at the factory. ﻿- You shittin' me? - Go! ﻿- I trusted you! - Couldn't be helped. ﻿Mous, come over. ﻿Go get me my Lacoste sweater. Man, she's dead! ﻿Must've been some fight. ﻿She's heavy! Gimme a hand. ﻿Grab her legs. ﻿It's bad for Dembo if you stay here. ﻿Why? ﻿They find an underage runaway, he's toast. ﻿Where am I gonna stay? ﻿There's too much shit goin' on. And he's a mess in court. ﻿I can't go, I'm waiting for Kim. ﻿The CS is gonna get us. ﻿The what? ﻿Crime Squad. I ain't leavin' without my dog. ﻿She's been sold by now! You ain't gonna find her. You gotta go. ﻿But they agreed! ﻿Did they now? Well, I want you outta here by tonight. ﻿I saw one with my dad. With a beard. I cracked up. ﻿Didn't you sell him a razor? ﻿You guys seen Iliès? ﻿- And Rachid, Nassim, and Mous? - Not for a while. - Where did the bastards go? - I dunno. ﻿If we knew we wouldn't tell you. ﻿I gotta buy me a Lacoste sweater... ﻿I was told Iliès was around. You seen him? ﻿Or Rachid, or Nassim, or Mous? ﻿You sure? ﻿Those bastards hit everybody for money. ﻿Forget it. ﻿There's a party at the projects. ﻿I don't see you guys no more. Where'd you vanish? ﻿What're you talking about? ﻿You swore you'd bring Kim back. ﻿I don't get it. ﻿No, I don't. ﻿I gotta show you something'. Come with me. ﻿What're you up to? ﻿You gotta come with me. ﻿They gave me Kim. ﻿I was gonna give her back to you, ﻿but there was no point. ﻿I buried her here. ﻿Wrapped her in my Lacoste sweater, ﻿the one I like best, ﻿so she'll be comfortable, although she don't give a shit now. ﻿We had nothin' to do with the dogfights. ﻿The younger you are, the shittier. Fuckin' projects! ﻿She'd still be alive if I hadn't met bastards like you! ﻿This place is worse than mine. ﻿Pantin is the pits! ﻿Dig out the grave and take your sweater back! ﻿I don't want your traitor's threads on her. ﻿She's better off without 'em. ﻿Don't bug me with your dog shit! ﻿You know who stole her. ﻿- Do what Sabrina told you. - What, leave ? ﻿Yeah. Dogs are useless bastards. Stop buggin' me with your questions. ﻿You know who killed her, that's for sure. ﻿Get out of my face! And get outta here. ﻿You sad because of your dog? ﻿Here, look. ﻿He's real nice. You'll love 'im. ﻿My dog just died and you want me to replace her? ﻿It's a gift from us. Me, Iliès, all of us. ﻿I can't! ﻿'Course you can! Yours is dead. ﻿- It was bound to die someday. - Not this way. ﻿Give this one a try. ﻿I also have his sister, she's even funnier. ﻿You won't know the difference. ﻿I don't think so. ﻿Besides, your dog was mangy. ﻿I saw it when we buried her. Right under her chin. ﻿That's how this disease starts. ﻿My dog wasn't sick. ﻿Suit yourself. ﻿No one can replace Kim. ﻿Call him Kim, too, so he'll always remind you of her. ﻿I can't do that. Kim is Kim. ﻿Well, my name is Mous. Tons of guys are named Mous, too. I don't mind. ﻿It's not the same. ﻿Okay, I'll go tell the others. ﻿Stop whining! ﻿So you tried him? You like him? ﻿I don't want him. ﻿Why not? Keep him. ﻿- The other one's already sold. - I wanna see Iliès. ﻿- He's busy. - I wanna see Iliès! ﻿When Kim was alive, so were you for me. But now you're dead. ﻿You don't exist no more. You got the wrong hand. ﻿If you trample me, I won't stay your friend. ﻿And Kim will be a re-hot mark on your foreheads. ﻿Especially yours. How could you be such a bastard? ﻿You're still fragile. You can find another pit. I play soccer, yet on my father's side, everybody's been murdered. ﻿Did I stop playin' soccer? ﻿You want me to play soccer? ﻿- Like before Kim? - Like before she died. ﻿You think I wanna play soccer with you? ﻿It'll do you a lot of good. ﻿If I do, it'll be to break your legs. ﻿Fine. ﻿It won't avenge Kim, but I'll sure try. ﻿No problem, then. ﻿Fine. ﻿I hope I hurt you. ﻿Yes, you did. You deserved it. ﻿I know. ﻿Now will you stop crying? ﻿- You goin' to Belleville? - None of your business. ﻿Gotta go see my stepdad at the factory. ﻿I'll come with you. Just let me get my moped. ﻿You again? What are you doing here? ﻿You still here ? ﻿You should see your face. ﻿You got a gun instead of a face. ﻿So fuck you! ﻿Stop acting like you was a woman ﻿and don't play Little Miss Warrior with me. ﻿Calm down, sir. ﻿What's this, huh? ﻿Let go of him. ﻿- Who the fuck is he? - I'll smoke 'im. ﻿I'm gonna file a complaint against you! ﻿You slut! ﻿I'm gonna blow your head off! ﻿You got a problem? ﻿Drop your gun! ﻿Let go! ﻿I'm gonna kill you! ﻿- Back off! - Stop acting up. ﻿I'm not acting up! ﻿- She just lost her dog, see... - Good riddance! ﻿Good fuckin' riddance! ﻿You gonna shoot two kids? ﻿Good thing that bitch died. ﻿Please drop your gun, sir. ﻿Let go, Iliès, he don't have half the balls it takes to shoot me. ﻿His balls, he only shows 'em to little girls. ﻿You fuckin' piece of shit! ﻿Let go of me! You have till Sunday to leave the house. ﻿Please stop, sir! ﻿Let's go. ﻿You scum! ﻿You fuckin', rottin' scum! ﻿Just you wait, you fuckers! ﻿You fuckin' motherfuckers! ﻿Pull over. ﻿Where's your helmet? You lent it to your grandma, you scumbag? ﻿Grab 'em. ﻿Forget it, René, come back. ﻿That was close. ﻿She lives here with her mother... ﻿Don't worry, I'll sleep on the landing. ﻿- Your stepdad, he's somethin'. - He's nothin'. ﻿Is that worse? ﻿I can't kiss you. If Kim saw me do it, she wouldn't like it. ﻿Nor would my mom. ﻿Who cares about your mom? ﻿I've been wonderin'... ﻿What? ﻿- Whether you're a bit Jewish. - I am. So what? ﻿I'm a Muslim, you're a Jew, we can't kiss. ﻿No one's forcin' you to. ﻿- I was talkin' about my mom. - Go back to her, then. ﻿It's you. I was wondering who it was. ﻿See you tomorrow, Tyson. ﻿- Can I crash with you? - No, my mom's here. ﻿No problem. Later. ﻿Sorry. Bye. ﻿Who's that? ﻿Whatcha doin' here? You live here? Go home. ﻿Leave me. ﻿You deaf or somethin'? ﻿Go home! Get outta here! ﻿Mom? ﻿Kim's dead. ﻿How are you? ﻿Him again, huh? ﻿Is Jessica alright? ﻿You think or you're sure? ﻿I prefer when you're sure, 'cause when you ain't, I can't trust you. ﻿Later. I love you. ﻿- How you doin'? - Whassup, Tyson? ﻿I looked for you everywhere. ﻿It's a mess. I gotta get outta here and go far, far away. ﻿Let's go build a hut near the Fort. ﻿I said far, far away, not two blocks down. ﻿Why not? It'll be like country houses for the rich. ﻿I gotta go. Gotta take care of my sister. ﻿You gonna leave? ﻿You gotta stay. You belong with us now. ﻿I'm gonna build, us a huge hut. ﻿We'll all live there, with Rachid and the other little fellas. ﻿What do you want in there? ﻿A huge freezer. In the hut? ﻿We'll pile up in it, they'll drag us out only when it's worth it. ﻿There's no electricity. ﻿You asked, I answered. ﻿I want a gigantic freezer. ﻿We can't sleep, or they'll get us like they did Kim. ﻿Let's not mention that again... ﻿And she stays with us. ﻿You go get her, then. ﻿- You think I'm goin' crazy? - I didn't say that. ﻿Come on! ﻿You're sick! ﻿Where you goin', guys? ﻿I gotta check in with the popo every Saturday. ﻿But I don't care, I go whenever I want. ﻿You're dangerous, man. We'll go with you. ﻿Get us some food, Nassim. ﻿- He's goin' to the cops! - Move your ass. ﻿Police! Help! ﻿Good luck. ﻿Hurry, okay? ﻿What're you doing here? ﻿How can I become a cop? ﻿That's new! You sure have the experience. ﻿How do you become a cop? ﻿Is there a dictation? ﻿You write an essay and take psychotechnical tests. ﻿They teach you how to shoot? ﻿When you get into the police academy. ﻿What, more school? ﻿You don't do it in a ﬂash. ﻿I've had it with school. ﻿Well, it takes a year, then you're a trainee, then you can use a gun. ﻿You do sports, too? ﻿You gotta run for twelve minutes and cover as much ground as you can. ﻿Some porkies here couldn' have passed that test. ﻿Watch what you're saying. ﻿I didn't mean you. ﻿Then who? ﻿No one in particular. ﻿You get a kick out of that, huh? Big guns, combat tricks... Is that what you're after? Is it okay to have a record? Kids' stuff. Are you shitting me? ﻿He was nuts! He asked me questions. ﻿What d'you tell the cop? ﻿I said, "Whaddya hafta do to become a cop?" ﻿What'd he say? ﻿He came up with big-ass words from the dictionary. ﻿"You gotta take provisional tests." Provisional? That's crazy. ﻿No, he said, "Psychological". Too much hassle. ﻿And you gotta run twelve minutes and go 'round the Eiffel Tower. ﻿Forget it. ﻿He was playin' with my head. ﻿Why don't you wanna be a cop? ﻿And have everybody rag on me? ﻿Why not say, "Later, I wanna be... a computer environmentalist." ﻿You think I got a dictionary in my brain? ﻿You don't know what a "Computer environmentalist" is? ﻿Go back to first grade. ﻿Shut the fuck up! Whaddya talkin' about? ﻿Is today Sunday? ﻿Yeah... ﻿He's clearing out today. ﻿You want me to come? ﻿Nah, he'd better not see you. ﻿I'll wait outside. ﻿I'd rather go by myself. ﻿- Then you'll come back? - I will. ﻿Why you cryin'? ﻿You know Kim's dead? ﻿Really ? ﻿They stole her then killed her. ﻿Who? ﻿I don't even know them. ﻿Why are you crying? ﻿Is it your dad? ﻿I know what's goin' on here. ﻿I'll be right back. ﻿Excuse me, you seen Mr. Estevez? ﻿Not today. ﻿There she is. ﻿Thanks.

She said she would. ﻿Keep an eye out. Go ahead, hurry. ﻿That's the one. Hurry! ﻿You think it's easy? ﻿- Keep an eye out! - All clear. ﻿Watch real good. ﻿Grab it. ﻿Keep an eye out! ﻿All clear? ﻿What a beautiful donkey! ﻿Watch out, comin' down. ﻿You go, Tyson, your turn. ﻿Go, Tyson, go! ﻿You thought it was a pit? ﻿I'm gonna fall! ﻿It stinks! ﻿The bastard! ﻿He almost tripped! ﻿He's gonna drop one! ﻿Check out the wedding dress. ﻿My mom didn't have one like that. ﻿It's gorgeous. ﻿Bit dusty. ﻿So what? ﻿Someone gettin' married? ﻿I wanna try it on. ﻿Don't throw it on the ground. ﻿Listen, listen! ﻿All I have to say is...

My turn. ﻿Iliès. ﻿Now, don't laugh at me. ﻿Iliès! ﻿What? ﻿Come here. ﻿Now! ﻿What do you think I am, your dog? ﻿Come here, Tyson. ﻿You too, Iliès. ﻿Now, you gotta really decide. ﻿It's yes or no. ﻿So which is it? ﻿It'll have to be yes. ﻿Here. Your ring. ﻿I hope you won't give it back to me. I hope not. ﻿You gotta make a speech. ﻿Speech! Speech! ﻿My sister and I will soon go to a foster home. ﻿Cut it out, guys! ﻿I'd rather be there than with that family. ﻿Don't y'all get jailed, I don't wanna lose you. ﻿Will you guys come and see me? ﻿I'll come and see you. ﻿Your stepdad'll go to jail, ﻿that's for sure. ﻿Forget what's gonna happen next. ﻿"Next" is not "Now". ﻿Watch for the landing! ﻿We've known each other only a week.
