(upbeat funky music) - Mama Mia, what is wrong with you girls? I want sweat, real sweat, you know what I'm talking about? Realism. No, no, no, I don't want any of this phony crap here. - [Woman] Okay. - Layla. You, you're suppose to be the actress here. Tell me, how am I suppose to get these $100 an hour bitches to sweat? Hey Ted baby, hey, what's happening? - Hi Tony. - I didn't see you come in. - Okay girls, now we want you to look your best. Mr Rossini is a bit of a perfectionist, but it's only because he wants you to look very well and this is a disco layout. We want to see everything in the costume, we wanna see the front, we wanna see the back. We wanna see the sides. So when I say "move", please girls for me, move. - Hey what's the matter? You look like shit. - I just dropped by to cheer myself up. I'll stick around till you're through okay? - Sure, sure, it's good to see you. I'll be right with you. Hey Layla, Layla avanti avanti. I need to see you. June get the cameras ready, we work all night. Avanti. (upbeat music) (camera clicking repeatedly) - [Tony] Ah yes, now keep it going girls. You come here with me. Want you to see yourself, now. Right here, I want you to look at me. Tell me what you think of this hey? Tell me, yes you tell me, tell me what you think of this. (moaning) Tell me, tell me what you think. - [Woman] What's on your reputed mind? - [Tony] I think we get the creative juices flowing, what do you think baby? - [Layla] My, my come on girls, come on, I want you to dance till you're wet. Come on move it, faster. Now. (upbeat funky music) That's it girls. - [Tony] Yeah. - [Layla] Come on. - [Tony] Very good glrls, keep it up, yes. Ah you bitch. (woman moaning and panting) - [Woman] Come on, shove it up. (upbeat funky music) - [Tony] Keep it dancing up there, keep it dancing. Don't pull out, don't pull out. Keep it dancing, keep it up. (upbeat funky music) (man groaning) - Here dear Teddy, is to old friends and to new adventures. So you're job gives you nothing, and neither does that nice middle-class girl you're shacked up with. - Joan's been faithful and supportive and - And boring and truish, et cetera, et cetera. - Yeah that too. - Reservations are all set, I rented a van for morning and I called and confirmed all the girls that are being interviewed. Oh hello Mr. Perlis. Gee you're not looking too well, are you feeling all right? - [Tony] Floyd here is suffering from terminal boredom. - Oh that's too bad, I wish you could go along with us on this trip. It would be nice to have someone intellectual along for a change. - Why don't you go wrap a set. - It's nice to have seen you Mr. Perlis, bye. - Holy shit, holy shit, that's it. That is it, you, you come with us. - What the hell are you talking about? - Look man, look. We've been friends for years huh, right? Look I've got lots of bucks, I'll put you on, at something, I don't know, anything. I'll put you on. - Hold it, what are you talking about? - Let me explain, tomorrow, we are leaving on a tour of the state to photograph girls, not professional models, but girls that Layla interviewed. Model for a day, it's an ad gimmick. Look it doesn't matter, you come with us, huh? It would great Teddy, just like the old days. - Cut it Tony. I mean in the old days, you weren't Antonio Rossini, renowned fashion photographer. You were just Tony Ross, stud, fuck off and all around hell raiser. For that matter, so was I. Now I got, mortgage payments, a job, a girlfriend, alimony. - The entire catastrophe. - Thanks anyway. - Lots of fringe benefits man. - Come on Tony, I just can't take off. - Why not? Hey Teddy boy, come here. Here. This is my dear friend is to adventure and your new job. - Hey thank you. - Excuse me. One thing burger brain, this is a very big account. The first time your dead weight friend there fucks up, it's either him or me. The whole thing is just damn unprofessional. - Hey look, maybe this isn't such a good idea. - No, no, no, don't worry. She'll get over it. She always does. Listen, listen, on this trip my friend, you are gonna see more untamed pussy than you ever thought possible. (laughing) Listen, don't worry about Layla huh? I'll take care of her. - Mr. Perlis, I'm glad you're coming with us on this trip. - Well whatever happens, it's gotta be better than what I'm leaving behind. - [June] Let's see, our first stop is just a few hours from here. At a health food store? - Oh come peach pussy, you can't be that pissed off that Ted joined us. - For the last three years, I have busted my ass for you and this business. You didn't even have the decency to consult me about bringing him along. Getting real tired of being treated like baggage Tony. - Well my five fingered friend, it looks like we're gonna be spending a lot of time together. Alone, we've been cut off. - You got it. (yelps) - I can't take it. - God I wish you didn't pay so well. - I usually have to listen to the two of them going at it all of the time. I'm really glad you're along, 'cause I've someone to talk with. (bell ringing) - There you are Karma, you look absolutely wonderful today. This is Antonio Rossini. - Bonjourno. - Antonio this is our earth mother image, Karmaline. - You might be a bitch to work with love, but you sure can pick them. - Come stai miss lady, it's a great great honor. - Thank you. I'm just glad that my energy and vibes are right for your photos Mr. Rossini. Are you a Scorpio? - Why yes, yes I am. - Scorpios are so intense. It's a good sign. - Karma, I'd like to introduce you to my assistant Teddy. - Hi, how do you do? - Oh you're very sensitive. You must be an Aquarius. - No. - Well yes, yes, Teddy is an Aquarius right? Very sensitive boy. Teddy is our costume consultant, yes. He will help pick out the costume for you and assist you in dressing. - How perfect. I just know I can trust you Teddy. - Layla. You select the settings, and tell June which lights to pick huh? Now Karma tell me, is there a place that you can change quickly? - Right back here in my store room. - Ah va bene, va bene. - Tony look I can't do this. - Oh sure you can, come on look you wanted adventure. - No, look, I don't know the first thing about wardrobe. - This is an adventure, it doesn't matter. (clears throat) (clears throat) - I have your wardrobe. - Can't you wait till after working hours, to get your friend laid? - Hey look, what have you got against Ted having a good time? The poor bastards been tied down for years. - It's amazing how you make your own power trip sound like concern. Truth is you just like manipulating people. God Tony, you've changed. You know I can hardly remember why I ever thought I loved you. - Mama Mia. - I'm so flattered that I was chosen to be in these ads. I want to show what a healthy diet can do for the body. Do you think you could help me with this? - Yeah, sure. Here we go. - I'll get that. Help me with these buttons here. - You think you should try on the breast-- vest? - I'll try it on later. Ted, if you find me attractive, I mean I think that's wonderful. Sex is a healthy part of nature and did you know that sex can be most enjoyable meditation that there is. And I think if we're going to be really in tune with each other, a sexual meditation is very important, don't you? - Oh yeah. - Can you believe it? Tony's back there with that Karma woman. I think it's disgusting. All he ever thinks about is sex, sex. - Sex, someone call? - But who's with... Ted. - Hey June, June come on. What is with you huh? - You wouldn't understand dildo head. - Dildo head. (Ted moaning) - [Ted] on what is it? - [Karma] Just coconut milk. Doesn't it feel wonderful? - [Ted] Oh yeah, yeah it does. Coconut milk huh? (moaning) (slow seductive music) (moaning) (heavy breathing) - [Ted] How about a break? Yeah. Okay. (squealing) (heavy breathing and moaning) (Ted moaning) - All right, get this down, let's get this down. - Well I think she's ready now. I did my best. - I'm all set. - Ah then let's hit it kids. Va bene, now I want this natural, just natural. Very good. Now you just action, action. Karma you were magnificent. - Can't you stay for a little while? You look like a man that could use some meditation. - No I catch you on the way back. I always wanted to get into health foods. Andiamo, come. Well Karma was great hey? You know if the rest of these non-professionals turn out as well, it'll be a snap. - Well what do you expect? I mean after all, it was my job to select the women. - Yes and you are the best aren't you? - At some things. - So what am I, chopped liver? Where's my applause for lugging and lifting and lighting and making it possible, for Mr wonderful here, to push his little button and rake in all the money? - How stupid, how simply stupid of me to forget your vital contribution in this. - You know, can you put down the mask for just once and say something nice to me. I do deserve it you know. - I'm sorry. - Hey June, you know how good you are at your job, don't expect him to get serious. I think he's forgotten how. - Well lover boy, tomorrow ought to be interesting don't you think? Oh come off it, for craps sake man. You got a fun fuck out of it. What do you care if it's available to everybody? - Maybe I do care, so just lay off huh? - Well you know, maybe just some of us, aren't cut out for meditation. - Real good Tony, keep it up and you'll turn Ted here into the same kind of person it's taken you years to become. - See that, there's hope for you yet. - That's what I'm afraid of. - No, no, no, no, girls, that is not the way we do it. Now start again. Oh Layla. - Hello, Serena Zukov, this is Antonio Rossini. - Ah bonjourno, I can see why Layla chose you. You are indeed a tribute to the art of dance and the essence of athletic femininity. - Thank you Mr Rossini. I'm certain that what you see however is best discovered without this bullshit. - Smart lady huh? - A very dedicated artist, so you can forget about getting laid here, sorry. - The class is done. I'm ready. - No problem Ms Zukof, I have your costume ready for you. - Girls. I told you not to observe this shooting. - Oh pardon me Serena but is it possible, are these young women your students? - Yes, why you ask? - Well I thought that maybe they could be in the shoot so there is a background. - Oh? - That is of course if you have no objections, I just thought it might set the mood more clearly. - Oh please Ms Zukof. - We just want to see what a fashion shoot is like. Please. - We won't get in the way, honestly. - Well, it would be good for you, yes. Well all right. - Oh wow, this is so much better than we hoped for. - Now just be subtle and let's hope Ms Zukof doesn't catch us. - You think it Will work? - Girls. Come on with this time. (gentle piano) - He's very good. - Oh God, I think he's wonderful. - My, my you are smitten aren't you? - So what? You wouldn't understand anyway. - Oh yes. Va bene, va bene, oh yes, yes, yes. Scusi, Scusi. Oh va bene, yes okay. I got a great idea. Tu, tu. - Yes. - Yes, give me a tuxedo out of wardrobe for Ted. - What? - A tuxedo avanti, tuxedo, you know? - I can see it coming now. - What like a butterfly. Very good, very good. Marvelous, marvelous. (dramatic music) Very good, very good. - Dorina, Dorina, you were superb, magnificent, magnificent. - Well thank you Mr Rossini and my students they did well I hope. - Very well, very well, but of course not as professional as you. I need to keep them to make a few more shots. But you did not stay, you go home. I will lock up. - Well that is very nice of you. Because I do have a lecture tonight at recital hall. You are a gentleman so I see. - Grazia. - Thank you, goodbye. - Ciao and bona note. - Oh no, he's not gonna-- - Oh yes, what else? Did you see the way they were flashing during the shoot? They deserve it. - Hey I don't know how you put up with it, I mean the two of you used to be lovers. - I don't wanna talk about it. So I'm going, you wanna come along? - Sure as hell don't wanna stay here. - Hey where the hell are you two going? - We didn't want to intrude on your creativity. - Don't worry, we'll be back to break down the equipment. Wouldn't want you to strain yourself. - Good, I didn't like them anyway. And besides, they wouldn't appreciate our little surprise. - Surprise? - Yeah, didn't you say you wanted some more shots of just us? - Well what did you girls have in mind? - Just a little dance routine of our own. - Ready? - What did you say to them? - Nothing, nothing man. I think they just like us. And who could blame them. (funky music) (gentle piano) (heavy breathing) (gentle moaning) - I didn't know you were that interested in Ted or anyone for that matter. - Look just because I don't go around undressing for every guy that walks by, doesn't meant that I-- - June that's not what I meant. Look I know we haven't been the best of friends but give me a chance all right? - Sorry. You know the truth is, I've always been a little jealous of you, besides what chance do I have with Ted, with Tony leading him around by his, you know, his thing. (laughing) - June, let me tell you a few things. Number one, just because Ted wants to get his yayas out after all these years of boredom, doesn't make him a terrible human being. You might notice, he's isn't doing all that well anyway. (laughing) If you need any help, I'm a woman. Underneath all those overalls and jeans you are too. We might wear different costumes but we're all in the same play. - Thanks. - Sure. (gentle music and women moaning) - [Tony] This was very good, bravissimo. - [Ted] Will you cut the accent Tony? - Look man, I'm telling you it was very good. What do you want me to say? So tell me, tell me, is sex without romance really so terrible? - I think I could learn to tolerate it. - You could? (laughing) - You know I don't understand what you ever saw in Tony. I'm sorry, but I just don't. - Well he was different once, before the fame and the money got to him. I think it's gotten to me too. If you two jail bait suckers are ready, maybe we can get going. - You know what? Somehow I don't think they approve. - Hey wait up. Excuse me. I'm coming with you. - Listen I told you, you must call me when I get back to the city, now not now, go away, go away. - Look you said we had what it took to become professional models didn't you? I want out of this hick town now. Take me with you. - You creeps. - Listen honey face it, you've been had. Let it be a lesson to you huh? These two guys just aren't worth the effort. - Come on let's go, everybody, come on June, let's go. Put that stuff in there, what is this? - What a waste. We went to all the trouble to fuck a couple of old men, pretending it was fun for nothing. Shit. - Come on let's go everybody, in the truck, in the truck, in the truck Layla, in. - Is Tony with you? - No he decided to turn in early, are you okay? - A little smashed, slightly depressed, completely disillusioned, almost suicidal. Nothing serious. Care to join me? - Yeah for a drink I think. Bartender, let me have a brandy. - You know, after the shoot's wrapped, I'm done. I don't think I can take it any longer. You know, I keep thinking, maybe Tony will change but... - I'm part of that aren't I? Part of the reason that everybody's -- - Oh not anymore. You know what? Beginning to enjoy having you around. - Thanks Layla. - Don't let anybody hear about it, might ruin my image. (laughing) Maybe June doesn't have such bad taste after all. Never mind. - Look I know she likes me, but I don't know. - I like her too. I guess she thinks that sex is something that only unintellectual people engage in. - Something like that. - That's too bad. Other than that, she's a damn fine lady. - So are you. - Thanks Ted. - I think I'll go to bed. This life in the fast lane is, a little too much for me. You all right? - Me? Well I'm still in first gear. We do have to work tomorrow though don't we? Little trick I learned. - One for the road. - You got it. - Here's your coat. - Oh thanks. - Hi. - Hi Einstein. What cha working on? Tomorrow's lighting plan? - No, it's my diary. I was just writing that, never mind, you're drunk you don't wanna hear it now. - Oh I'm not as drunk as I'd like to be. I never am June. Come on what are you writing huh? - Men can't please me. I won't let them. Even Ted has proven weak and Layla is not the-- - Go on. - Is the not the selfish bitch I thought she was. (laughing) - That's good. - My only fear...- Listen June, if there's something you don't want to tell me listen I understand completely. - No, no I wanna say it. Layla I trust you. I want to say it. My only fear is I will never be able to get out of my mind and into my body. I'm afraid to be passionate. - Oh June, it's okay. Honey it will come in time. Honestly. - Please, I trust you. - June I, are you sure? I don't wanna do anything. (gentle seductive music) I love your body June. I just want you to feel good. Tell me if I do anything you don't like. - [June] Okay. - [Layla] Okay. (gentle piano) - That was beautiful. Do the men that you've been with, make you feel that good? - Sure know the right things to say don't you? - Well do they? - They used to. Sometimes I feel like it's even better. - I was having the most amazing fantasy. - I know. - Really? - You were thinking about a man, especially when you were coming. - I was. But how did you know? - Oh I've been there, quite a few times before. Who were you thinking of? - Well, just a man. It's not important. - No you're right. You won't have any problems when the right man comes along. I can tell you that, that's for sure. You're a natural born lover, lover. (upbeat music) - And after that I left home and found the job with Tony. - Gee, just one bad turn after another. (laughing) - You two are in one hell of a good mood this morning. - Well we got a good nights sleep last night. (upbeat music) - Well we sure are proud of our little Chrissy, being chosen to model for your ads and all aren't we mother? - We certainly are. I only hope she'll do well. She's so young you know, only just graduated high school. - [Man] Straight As. - [Woman] Valedictorian. - Oh that's wonderful. - [Man] Yes. - Yes, yes I'm sure that she will do fine. You see our Layla here has a wonderful eye for talent and I'm sure that Chrissy-- Oh Chrissy. - Hello Chrissy. Don't you look nice today, you ready? - Hi Miss Ford. - Now don't you worry about a thing, we'll have Chrissy back in about three or four hours. - Oh that's fine, just fine. - I'll find my glasses and we'll catch the Jeanette Mcdonald Nelson Eddy festival. We're just in time for the matinee. - Don't worry Mr. and Mrs. Hudson, Chrissy here she is a good hands. Good. - You lay one finger on that girl, and I'll have you by your professional balls. Got it? - Ms Ford is right, she said that Chrissy has that certain innocent appeal that I've been looking for. Avanto. Avanti ciao. - Ciao. Bye, bye bye dear. (gentle piano) - [Chrissy] God bless you. - You did a splendidly Chrissy. Your parents can be very proud. - Thank you Mr. Rossini. - [Layla] We have to get you right home and into bed. - Oh absolutely Layla. We can't have our Chrissy here getting sick on us can we? And since our hotel is right on the way and we must pack anyway, I'll drop you all off and I take Chrissy home. - How thoughtful of you Tony. - Oh it is nothing. - But I have a better idea. - Damn it woman, now why the hell did you do that? You're starting to piss me off. - We have work to do Tony and you know it. Besides Ted I trust, got it? - You know what I got? I got a good mind to go fire you, that's what I got Layla. - You don't have a good mind to do anything. - Tony- - What? - Are you really that upset about losing a chance to screw Chrissy? - No, no I'm not but I'm the boss here. I'm in control and I don't want anybody telling me what to do, especially her and that includes you. - I'm really sorry you caught a cold. I hope your parents will understand. - It's not your fault, really. I was getting a cold anyway before today. - Well look here's your bag, I'm sorry about this. - You're nice thank you but really I'll be all right. - Yeah good. Hey, let me take you inside. I hope you feel better, I'm really sorry. - It's all right, honest. Maybe some hot tea or something. The kitchen's over there. - Tea? Yeah, yeah sure, I'll make you some hot tea before I go. But I have to leave very soon. - Thank you. - Very, very soon. Chrissy, Chrissy. Hello? Chrissy. - Oh gosh, I must of fallen asleep, I guess I don't feel so good. - I have your tea here. - Oh would you bring it to me please? - Bring it to you? Certainly sure. - Thanks. I'm sure glad you're here to help me Mr. Perlis. Really. - Yeah well I really have to go now. That is if you'll be okay? - Of course, I'll be okay once I put some of that vapor rub on. Would you get it for me please? - Yeah, yeah sure. - I'll hold this up if you'll put some on me. - Yeah just a little bit. - Come on silly bastard let's play. (gentle seductive music) That's fun. - I shouldn't be doing this you know that. - [Chrissy] Oh yeah, bite my nipples. Bite them, bite them. (moaning) - [Ted] What if your parents come home? - [Chrissy] He's beautiful. - [Ted] Take this off. - [Chrissy] Get your pants off. (heavy breathing and moaning) I want it so bad from you. So bad. (heavy breathing and moaning) - [Ted] Where did you learn to do that? - [Chrissy] I read a lot. Come here, yeah. Put your cock in my pussy. Real deep. - [Ted] Oh yeah. - [Chrissy] Push it in, come on. Oh I love it. Oh yeah. Oh it's so good, your cock is so good. (heavy breathing and panting) Come on fuck me, come on. Oh yeah. (groaning) Oh yeah. With tongue, with tongue. Oh yeah, yeah. With tongue, lick my clit, my clit. (groaning) Yeah. Yeah. Come on top of me, let me see you come. - [Ted] Oh yeah? - [Chrissy] I wanna see you. - [Ted] Okay. - [Chrissy] I wanna see you come. (Ted groaning) Ted, can we play a game? Just one game. You don't have to do anything but just lie still okay? - [Ted] Yeah sure, whatever you want. (upbeat playful music) - [Chrissy] Hey Ted, Ted. - [Mother] Chrissy. - So until we actually see this woman's house, there's no way we can-- - It's a mansion, a mansion. The lady lives in a mansion. - Mansion or whatever, until we actually get there, I can't give you anything more than a general idea of a lighting plan. - June, June so why the hell do you work with me? - What? - Come on you heard me. - Lots of reasons. - Come on June, Layla and I don't do anything more than trade insults. Ted wants to leave, right? And you're the only one left, why? - Thanks. - Come on you know what I mean. Why are you here? - At first I thought you were a genius. I still do, but you are an asshole genius. - Well that much we know. - Well then I thought if I could make any sense out of what was going on in that studio, I could understand anything. - And? - No way, now I don't know why I stay. Sorry I just wish I could help. - Yeah me too. Fuck it, it doesn't matter, it all stinks lately. - I'm really sorry Tony. - Yeah. Don't worry. Thanks. - [Tony] How you doing boy scout? - Oh fine. - [Tony] Hey listen Ted, I might have to go away for a while I don't know, I wanna go to Spain for a couple of months or Greece, wanna come along? - No I can't. I gotta find a new job. A real job. - [Tony] Yeah. - By the way, Chrissy wasn't so innocent. - You're shitting me? Oh you gotta tell me, this has gotta be a classic. Come on. - Hey now look, don't tell Layla all right? I mean I feel really shitty about that. - I'm not gonna say anything. Look this is the great Antonio Rossini speaking to you. So you gotta tell me, what happened? - You wanna know what happened? - I want to know what happened right from the beginning. - You want to know what happened? - What happened? - Tony Rossini wants to know what happened. - Yes. - I'll tell you. I was raped. - You were raped? - Raped. - He was raped, he was raped. (laughing) - She raped me. She raped me. - You were raped? - Yes. - By this? (laughing) - Did you hear that? I wonder what those two-- - I know what kind of laughter that is. Thank God tomorrow's our last day. - Oh Harmon our guests are arriving a bit early, I do hope we're prepared. - Of course madame. - Of course, after so many adventures together, how could I even ask. Or of the mid once this time, tall quite intelligent. This should be a true test of your theories Ariellanna. (suspenseful music) - Holy shit. Hey Layla why didn't you tell me? - I hadn't seen it myself. I met her in New York at the ad agency, she's a stockholder. She offered herself and her home for one of the layouts. I had the impression they couldn't say no. - Who the hell is this woman? - Arielanna Vanlearn Devain Hieress of the Devain publishing empire. Degrees in psychology, art and science. Quite reclusive since the death of her husband nine years ago. Stockholder and-- - Thank you Ms Britannica. Well troops lets get a going. - Welcome, Mrs. Devain will be joining you for cocktails after you've freshened up. - I do not think it's necessary to freshen up. - After you've freshened up sir. - I think we're going to have to freshen up hey? Andiammo come on. The women first. - Well well my how handsome. I hope you found everything you needed. - Yes, yes. - Thank you very much for the clothes. - Oh yes, you seem to have thought of everything. - One of my little quirks, perfection. I provided some clothes for the ladies too. Here they come. - Wow. - Mama Mia. - Hey, that's nice. - Perfection. - Thank you very much. - Harmond, would you seat our guests please? - Mrs. Ford. - Don't believe. Ah yes. - So I simply decided to please myself and study those aspects of psychology and human behavior that interested me. Oh it's been lonely at times, but never never boring. - Look I don't mean to be pushy but-- - Oh of course, of course. Harmon. - Yes madame, everything is in order. - Wonderful, now if you all would indulge me for just a little while longer. You see I know a great deal more about you, each of you, than I've let on. And how should I put this? Well, I'll put it decently, you see for the past nine years, I've been engaged in an experiment. Well a study actually of human behavior. - Ariel I don't see how this is any-- - Let her finish. - Thank you June. Really there's nothing mysterious about it. Simply stated I need your help for a short time, that of a few hours and in exchange I think I'll be able to help each of you. That is, if you're willing. (suspenseful music) - I really don't understand why Layla's getting so upset. I think it's all really exciting. - I know and it's that sense of trust you have. It's going to make this a very important night for you. - How do you know so much about us? - Well a combination of intuition and intelligence, research and a great deal of money to get whatever I want with. Now just enjoy yourself. Relax, browse and I'll be back in a little while. - Listen Harmon, if Ariel wants me to play games I'd like to know why. What the hell is going on here? - I am sorry if you're confused sir, but I'm sure madame will explain. - Well she had better. - In here sir. - In here. Yes but this is a dark room. - That is the master bedroom sir. - Well you're lucky Harmon, 'cause the only darker room I go into, is a bedroom. (rapid knocking) Shit. All right Harmon, I get it. It's a little joke huh? You're actually count Dracula in disguise. Right? Right? Right? - Wrong. (seductive music) (nervously laughing) - I like your outfit. Is this a part of the experiment or just a pleasant distraction? - A little bit Of both. Per favore. - Si, si. Oh la la. Oh this is nice, this is very nice. It's a very difficult to open but yes, oh it's very good. Suck it. Suck it. Oh yes. Very nice. (moaning) Wait wait wait what is this, what is this? - [Ariel] What's the matter? Did I do something wrong? - [Tony] Oh no no no just I don't like, I don't like being tied up, I mean it's a bit awkward. - [Ariel] Oh it's just a game, it's just for fun. You see I've never tried it before. - Well maybe, maybe just a little bit. - [Ariel] Just a little bit. - [Tony] Oh yes, it's very nice. Oh it's very nice, yes. It's nice. No, no, no wait no, wait a second, wait, wait. - [Ariel] Oh no no no no. Try it. - [Tony] Yes. I try it. - [Ariel] You like? - [Tony] It's not bad. Interesting. That's very good. - Ms. Lamb. - Yes? Where's Ariel? - She Will be with you very soon. She asked that you change clothes. These are yours. - But where is everybody? - They're all having a wonderful time, and wish only the same for you. Please Ms. Lamb, relax. There's nothing here for you but pleasure and enjoyment. Here these are for you to wear. - Thank you. It's all so strange. But you have made me feel better Harmon. - [Tony] Oh that's very good Ariel, that's very good. That's very good, oh that's very good, oh yes, yes, very good, I'm -- - [Ariel] No. - [Tony] Damn it woman, how many times are you gonna do that huh? Look all right, all right, let's cut these God damn scarves off, let's get back on the right track. - [Ariel] The right track Tony? Oh you mean where you're in control all the time, telling everybody else what to do and when. - [Tony] Look Ariel just cut the fucking scarves off huh? - [Ariel] Tony, please don't make me mad, because then I might decide to just leave you here, for Harmon, who has rather bizarre tastes I'm afraid. - [Tony] It's just that this is not my thing, I got carried away, I didn't mean-- - [Ariel] Tony, I've got a lot to teach you Tony, but you've got to shut up and listen. You talk all the time so you never hear anything. - [Tony] Okay Ariel, please I just want-- - [Ariel] One more word and I'm leaving. Understand? Good because I really like you Tony. Now, for the first lesson, we'll call it cunnilingus 101. You see Tony, I want you to make me come. Starting to like not being in control Tony? Tony, I haven't come in a very long time, this is not going to be easy, but the better you make it for me, the better I'll make it for you. (heavy breathing) Oh yes, that's not bad. That's the way, lightly lightly, yes, yes, now you can take your tongue down further and then you can run in deeper and deeper, now you can go in there where you want to go. See now it's open and wet and flowing, now put your nose up there against that spot on top. That's the way, that's the way, yes now you're hitting them both. Oh good Tony, oh good, oh good Tony. (moaning) Oh Tony. That was very good. Now... - [Tony] Don't strangle me please? - [Ariel] Now this is just more of the game, put your head up, that's a good boy. Can you see it, tell me the truth? - [Tony] Oh I can't see. I can't see that. - [Ariel] Now you just lie here and I'll be right back. - Where are you going? Wait, wait, wait. Wa-- Shit. - Where the hell is everyone? It's all damn crap, this whole thing. I just wanna get home. You fucked her didn't you? - Who? - You know damn well who. Chrissy. You didn't think you'd slip that one by me. - Look, look I told Tony not to tell you. It wasn't my fault Layla. - Tony didn't have to say anything. I heard you come in last night. I've heard that kind of locker room laughter before. - And where did you get so damn holy? I mean if the truth makes any difference to you, Chrissy was a little Lolita who bullshitted me like a pro. - Oh did she force you to fuck her at gunpoint? - It doesn't make any difference. She was just like all the others. Selfish, pushy, conniving. I mean I felt nothing but used ever since this whole trip started. - Honey, you don't know what used is. - Pardon me but, well are you two through pitying yourselves or should I come back later? - Listen your impression of anti-maim is very entertaining. But I'm getting tired of your self-indulgent bullshit. - Layla what are you so afraid of? - I'm not afraid. I would just like to know, Ariel sweetheart, if we are going to find out exactly what is going on around here. - I don't know, I hope, I truly hope that you will see what is here for you, but well your attitude isn't helping I'm afraid. - No more psychology games. Now where are Tony and June? What in the hell do you want from me? - I am just trying to help you. (thwack) - Layla for Christ's sake. - Oh Layla, you are so used to being hostile and sarcastic that you can't feel anymore. - No. - You've let your impressions of Tony, interfere with, come between you and any man that might want to love you. I don't know, if ever feel again anything except resentment. (sobbing) - Why the hell did you do that to her huh? - Why you simple minded little worm. - What? - You insignificant cock-minded piss head. You run around everywhere trying to find someone to give you, what you think you deserve. Oh poor poor Teddy. - I don't know what the hell you're talking about. - Oh yes you do. You're afraid to reach out. You want it all handed to you. You haven't got the spine to stand on your own two feet and go after what you want. Oh you simpering wimp, hiding behind your romance-- - Leave him alone Arielanna. - Huh? Enter the heroine, you both disgust me with your petty bullshit. - What the hell was all that about? - She was right. - What? - Thank you for defending me Ted. - Hey thank you. I thought she was gonna tear my throat out. (sobbing) Hey, are you okay? - God damn her. She was right. (sobbing) - Perfect. - Ariel. - Hello June, my you look beautiful. - Thank you. - Are you ready? - I don't know what I should be ready for. - Why to be released June. First put some of this on. This is what I've been wearing all day. And we have a little secret to keep from a man with a very sensitive nose. - Can't you tell me more about what's going on here? I mean, where's Tony and the others? - Well perhaps we should have a little talk before you spread your wings. (smooth music) - God, I'm sorry Ted. I haven't cried like that since I was a little girl. Was Ariel right about what she said? That you were afraid to go after what you wanted? - Yeah, yeah. Hell I expected some perfect woman just to turn up and offer herself to me, it's true. - Maybe it's time you stop waiting and did something about it. Oh no you don't Teddy, you have to go after what you want. - What about you? If I catch you, will you be able to feel? Will you be able to feel me, or will you be thinking about Tony? - Tony who? - I need a serious answer Layla. - Well that's a chance you'll just have to take. - Ted, I don't want you to fuck me, I want you to make love to me. I want you to make me feel something Ted. Yes. - You ready June? - I guess so. - Now, I'll stay with you, just trust your instincts you'll be fine. - [Tony] Who's there? - [Ariel] Tony. - [Tony] Oh there you are, am I happy to see you. - [Ariel] You're beginning to enjoy it not being in the drivers seat. - [Tony] Oh you know it baby, but listen I'm gonna explode, I'm gonna come now, I gotta come. - [Ariel] Oh Tony, well perhaps I should get you a new partner. June for instance. - [Tony] June? (laughing) Don't make me laugh, hey look, I mean June. June is a lot more than I thought she was, June really thinks that sex is an act of mental retardation at an early age. Come on, now what about us? (moaning) Oh that's great. Now do you think June would do that? Oh come on, oh that's great, oh yes baby. Oh yes, oh yes. Oh yes, oh yes I needed that, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm gonna come soon. God damn it, you did it, what you got four hands? What goes on here? - [June] Now, just relax Tony. - [Tony] Oh come on, what the hell. - [June] Just relax, now comes the hard part. You see, you have to fuck me Tony and you have to make me come before you do, understand? Don't let yourself come Tony or else. - [Tony] Oh yes, all right. Yes. (moaning) Oh that's so good, that's it. - [Ariel] That's right Tony, tell me how to move. - [Tony] Yes. - [Ariel] Now Tony you tell me, what you want. - [Tony] Oh yes, not so fast, not so fast, oh that's nice, oh yeah that's great. Oh yeah. (moaning) Oh yeah. Oh that is-- yeah. (heavy breathing) Oh yeah. - [June] Oh God. Oh God. (moaning) Oh God. (heavy breathing) - [Tony] That was great. Oh Ariel. - [June] Surprise. - [Tony] When did you? You? - [June] You'll never know will you? - [Tony] And I'll never care. (smooth music) (moaning and heavy breathing) - [June] Oh yeah. Oh yeah. (moaning) Look at me. - [Tony] How's that? Slip these off then. (moaning) - [June] I wanna taste you. (heavy breathing) (moaning) (gentle sweeping music) - [Tony] June. I don't know how to tell you this. - [June] You just did. (moaning) Come on. Oh that's so good Ted, please come. (heavy breathing) - I can't find anybody, I couldn't find him anywhere. There's this note. Thank you for helping me with my studies. Please all I ask is that you share this experience with no one beyond yourself. My love to you all, Ariel. - Well I for one think she was some kind of witch. - Not at all, she's a psychologist, who figured out how to get past our fears that's all. - That's all? - That's all. - That's all. (laughing) - That's all, simple. - It's simple. - Yes. Well let's hit the road, or should I say, avanti, avanti. - Avanti. - The best yet, don't you think so Harmon? - 'Course madame, I'm rather sorry to see them leave actually. - There will be others Harmon but we did learn so much from these. - [Tony] I have a suggestion, a quick trip home and four plane tickets to Greece for the weekend. - [Ted] Oh I don't know, I think perhaps the Caribbean would be more to my taste. - [June] I'll settle for the first motel with a waterbed, I always wanted to try it out. (laughing) (upbeat music)
