My dad's the best. When I was born, he decided to take a business degree. You'll be proud of me, Nico. You'll go around telling everyone that Curro Montejo is your father. And he graduated in only ten years, in a prestigious distance learn in university, the Matapedrete University. After that, he made his biggest wish come true, to work for a big finance company. - What are you doing? - What's the problem? OK, OK! But in truth... my dad never liked that environment. - Come on, feet up! - Excuse me. So you don't slip, it's an insurance thing! He found it cold and distant. And worst of all, he didn't feel valued. Someday, he made a big decision, much to Mom's surprise. Hey, Antonio! - We all have to strike together. - Daniela! We'll talk later. Curro! Hi, baby! I did it! I finally grabbed the bull by the horns and offered to be staff representative. Really? The factory has a new owner and guess what he wants to do? - Ow! - Sorry. He wants to cut staff. Good thing you've got a stable job. - I have some thing to tell you. - What? - I did it! I quit! - Quit what? - My stable job. What else? - You quit your stable job? Encouraged by Mom, Dad went in search of his dream job. I laminated mine. It's like a menu, too much handling make sit grubby. Although it wasn't easy at first. To develop our apps, we work with Facebook, Instagram, Linkedln... I don't have a problem working with anyone, But"Miguelin"and "Felixbox"... Do they speak Spanish? My English isn't that tres bien. Yeah, so I see... Curro, shall we get started? Shouldn't we wait for your boss, kid? I am the boss. - You seem lovely! - Don't I just! - Is anyone else coming? - No. - Should I come closer? - No. Is this the town crier interview? What do you value about oriental companies? Your diligence. Look at this for example. - Sugared almond or kitty litter? - Kitty? And that geranium's fantastic. In a year, you'll have shade for the whole office. Finally, my dad got lucky and a German company took hi Mon. - Welcome to Cookfrei. - Thank you. He was quick to show off his talents. Just pop the flour in and after 12 minutes, fantastic bechamel. So he started doing what he loved most, working with people. He had loads of customers. One for aunty Mary. Another one for my favorite niece, Marta. And one for my brother-in-law, the champ! Cousin Alfonso, only one? What gives? - Don't you ea tat the beach house? - OK, so two. And for the in-law sat Christmas, what? A cervical cushion? Dad was so good at his job, he decided it was time to move. Look at the size of it. Think how much "fentui" we can do! We'll take it. And to enjoy a few luxuries. "Fentui"? Honey, no more house work. We have robots for everything! We can't move for all the technology! We've got Smart TV with Dolby Surround Sound, a self-cleaning oven, a new food processor, a massage chair, an Irish coffee machine, an arcade game for Nico, we've got... Have we got three kilowatts? We came up a bit short there. Thanks to his business sense he always knew what was be trustful. Always with great common sense. Honey, don't you think we're spending too much? You're right. Nico, it's irresponsible spending money left and right, - especially on credit. - Of course. Unless interest rates are this low. Only an idiot wouldn't get credit. Thank you. But like he always said, sometimes there are slumps. Your sales have gone down 90%. - Have you run out of ambition? - I've run out of relatives. Sales shouldn't stop there. Luckily, my dad always found a solution to his problems. Good afternoon. - Hello. - We're from Capital Credit, You have two months left to... - Sorry, we're all Catholics here. - Sir! But the slump lasted Longer than he imagined. What's going on? They're taking everything! - Even my slippers! - They were mink. - You deserve the best. - I deserve to be listened to, and I told you not to take out so much credit. Don't worry, I have a plan. Abridge loan to tide us over! I'd like to throw you off abridge! I can't take it anymore. I'm leaving. What do you mean? Listen tome, please! So that Dad could get over the slump, Mum and I went to grandma and grandpa's. I got the sheets. How long are we going to stay here for? I don't know, Nico. Come on, make your bed up. And careful where you put your weight, if it closes, it'll snap your neck. See? Mean while, my dad carried on with his important business. - Hi, Nico. - Dad, where are you? About to have a business lunch. An entrepreneur never rests. - Really? - Valet! Park my car! And don't scratch it. - You coming to my game on Friday? - Wouldn't miss it! - Awesome! - The Sommelier's here. Talk later, OK? What's on the menu today, Sister? Roasted sea bream? But luckily, everything was about to change. When are we going to make up? I'm lost without you. Like a compass with no north, a car with no GPS... OK, I get the picture, Curro. Suddenly your value shave changed. What values? I never had any. That's my boy! What a goal! - It was an own goal! - You're always so demanding. - The score changed, so it was a goal. - OK. If we we real good at football, winning the golden boot wouldn't be exciting. Did you tell your dad about your exam? I got a six point five. You're hard working like me, and hard work always pays off. I'm going over there. Good job, good job! You little whizz! And the day was least expecting it, in spite of all his work, Dad revealed his big surprise. - Nico. - What? If you get As all year, I promise you the best vacation of your life! - Seriously? - Of course. Liar. - Yes. - No. - Dad! I know you! - I'm not lying! - OK, Dad. - That's what like to hear.. Give me your bag. Go with your friends. What were you thinking making a promise you can't keep? For a union member you don't know much about incentives. - Me? - Nico always gets Cs. This way I'll stimulate his productivity and he'll pass with Bs. - With Bs? - Incentives, babe, incentives. Incentives! I'll give you an incentive alright! My dad may not be the best looking, the youngest or the smartest, but one thing he's got is that he always keeps his promises. THE BEST SUMMER OF MY LIFE THREE MONTHS LATER Your attention for a moment, please. I want to talk about something this company badly needs. - Bonuses? - No, Montejo, no. Motivation. So this summer, I've decided to hold a competition. Who ever sells the most, will become the new regional sales manager. And the three who sell the least will be fired. - What? - The winner will be come sales manager. And the bottom three fired. Remember the three letters that make up a good salesman: C for customer service, S for spontaneity and P, for product pride. Remember, you're not sales people, you're sales animals! I'm all emotional again. So move it! Get selling! I'm going to miss you, Montejo. You've got such bad sales... You said that last year and I be a ted you. "Alea jacta est". If you want to insult me, don't do it in Arabic. - It mean studied is cast. - Yeah, I know. - "Ally-hacker test". - Animals! Get selling! Jeez! LOCAL PUBLIC SCHOOL Teresa Toribio... Spoil little brat. Erika Herreras... I hope you repeat the year. - Nicolas Montejo? - Thanks. Congratulations, kid. Marc Calvo? Sorry, Ma'am. Are these my kid's? Nicolas Montejo, brown hair, handsome. I know who your son is. These are his grades. Please, you're in the way and I cant leave on vacation until I finish. - Vacation? Lucky you! - Yes. With my husband. Though I'd rather lock myself away for three months with no kids! Marc Calvo. Excuse me! - You again? - Sorry, it's just... I'm not saying my kid's not smart, but all As? He's not Einstein. - Can you take another look? - There's no need, Mr. Montejo. - Mickey... - Nico. Yes, sorry. His exams were perfect. How could they be after everything? - The logical outcome is total failure. - That's not true. Some kids flourish during family crises. Moving house, foreclosures, a separation, this isn't a crisis, it's a catastrophe! A catastrophe! I see where Nico gets his passion for hyperbole. My son's going to think he's cold, lacking in human empathy. Can you imagine the damage this could do to a half-developed brain? What? Can't you just lower his average a bit? - Give him a Bin gym, for example. - Gym? He walks funny, one foot points the other way, it's a dysfunction. Please! You know what? I think you've also learn a valuable lesson. What? Not to make promises you can't keep. Look... If you can't take him on holiday because of money trouble, just explain. He'll understand. - He got an A in religion. - So I saw. Forgiveness is guaranteed. Happy summer! For you maybe. Jimenez Textiles is a prestigious brand - thanks to us, the workers. - That's great. Thanks. Not the owners, who want to sell our factory to a Filipino company. They want to relocate outside Spain. So we can see. The drama of relocation... Not for sale, not for sale! - Daniela. - Hi, Curro. Look at this, the kid got straight As. Oh my God! Straight As! My Nico! He's so smart! - Now what are you going to do? - Keep my promise, of course! Don't be stupid! - Even if I have to sell an organ! - An organ? But not my liver. A holiday with no booze isn't a holiday! Look, my brother's going to Morocco. He can go with them. No. I promised him a holiday and that's what he'll get. Show a bit of optimism, woman! - I really don't see what you can do. - What I've done all my life! - Take out a loan? - No, find away! Please! You're bankrupt! I'll think of something. Trust me. How? Even your car's been repossessed! I have a solution for that. - Remember my friend Paco? - The one in jail? Yes! He lent me his. Two years and one day. And that car's a collector's item. Pure vintage! That's my dad! That's my dad! - Weren't you going to rent a 4x4? - No son, no. This is a "2x2", look! Well, except for the mats, which are 1x1. - And that? - A sales man never rests! - Got the passports? - Don't worry. It's all under control. Say goodbye. Take care, OK? And take care of him too. Call me every night. I love you lots... - How's it hanging, "Dad"? - I'd sure like to hang you. Drive carefully, it's raining. - Be positive! It'll be sunny soon! - Sunny? Nico, remember what taught you? - Yes. OK, so push and put it in to gear when I say so. - What? - Come on! Push! That's it! Daniela, just think how happy you'd be! With them, you mean? No, dear... A widow! - Start the engine! - That's it, jump in! You have to be optimistic, son. Bright and sunny, just like I said. Dad, the gas station is over there. The gas station is for those who haven't paid for their gas yet. What's he doing? - Dad, are you stealing it? - No, son. I'm taking what's already mine. This is a top-of-the-range Mercedes. It's worth 65K. The owner of this car pays 35% in tax, while I, with my modest paycheck, pay 20%. This applies to everything, except gas. This guy should be paying 15 % more. So I'm taking the 15 % extra I've already paid for. Really it belongs tome, see? Just ice and equality above all. Thank you. Have a safe trip. - Can we put the radio on? - Yeah, sure. Use this. - Put it in there. - What is it? This is called an amplifier. Here we can only get Radio Maria. - Where are we going? - It's a surprise. - Is it in Europe? - Yes. - Euro Disney? - Cold. - Another amusement park? - Cold, cold. - Just tell me! - We're going to do some rural tourism! Not that modern kind, with rafting and "coaching". - OK... - This is a traditional vacation, like in the good old days. You'll make some new friends and have a blast. We're almost there. Fuenteovejas? - Are you kidding? - No. - This is a joke. - No, really. - Fuenteovejas? - Of course! The village where your dad was born. Nature, fresh air. - It smells of manure. - Silence. - Well, well! - Aunty! I'm her favorite nephew, she loves me like her own. - Look who it is! - Aunty, you look great! So do you. - Who are you? - Curro, Fran and Mari's son. - We've come to visit. - Wonderful! - Where are you staying? - Here with you! Here? Nico, give Aunty a kiss. - Hello. - Hello. The last time I saw you he wasn't even born. - Does he eat a lot? - Like a horse. You don't say. Come in, little one. Nico, a real village house, with its gloomy interior, damp, and dust mites. At 11, I turn down the lights, to save electricity. And environmentally sustainable! The planet comes first! You know where the bedroom is. - Upstairs. - Off you go. - It's a bit scary. - Listen! - If you're hot, - Yes? Then sweat, like in the good old days! This room brings back memories. Once, when I was ten, a bat the size of a dog fie win. I was so scared, I wet the bed. Here, look! - The map of Australia. - Gross! Aunty's very nostalgic. But Dad, why did we have to come here? Because you got straight As! Let's call mom, tell her how much fun we're having. Call social services while you're a tit. - Is that Mom? - I wish. Calling to throw in the towel? No. I'm calling to let you know I just scored a hat-trick. - Three sales at once. - I'm about to place eight. Place them on a shelf, you mean? Eight! In your dreams! I'm in my favorite hunting ground. I'm in my element. So you'd better decide if you prefer to call me boss or Mr. Curro. I've got a ton of relatives here, my specialty. Mr. Curro, ha! - What about your nephew? - He's bright. - Yours or from a test tube? - Aunty! He's mine, not a test-tube baby! 100% Montejo. How's Daniela? Left you yet? No, she couldn't make it. - She's busy at work. - So she's left you. She hasn't left me! She's on strike at her factory. Oh, good Lord! A union member, commie and a divorcee, she's got it all. Bon appetit. Here you go, kid. - Can I have some bread? - Don't buy the stuff. Too much "gutlen" in it. Tuck in. What better than a family meal? And talking of family, - how's Carmelita? - Aunty Carmelita... Died three years ago, but otherwise OK. She was very old. And Uncle Jose Ignacio? Dead for five years. He's not so well. - RIP. - His spirit's still here with us. Amen. And Aunty Angustias? Aunty Angustias? She's still alive, but she emigrated to Canada. And cousins Paula, Antonia and Paquitaare still here? - No. - Another one that got away! Is cousin Rafa still here? Perfect. - And what's Rafa's wife like? - A floozy. Aunty! Don't be so rude. Does she like to cook? Who are you, the police? Just making conversation. You must be lonely here. - Not at all. I have my cat. - Cat? - Where is it? - Look! There he is. Ricardo. What? - Are you full? - No... It's yummy! - Are you ready to meet your new gang? - Sure. Wait until you see the local park. It's got lots of swings, slides, zip-lines, cabins... Great for hide-and-seek. It's amazing. They must have built a better park some where. Wouldn't be hard. Look! Natives! It's wonderful. So much local knowledge in one place. - Good morning. - Good morning. Which park do the kids play in? - Or where do they play? - Benito plays boules under the bell tower. No, I meant the children. - The what? - The children, kids, youngsters. Whippersnappers, nippers, bambini. Like you, but full of life. Squeaky voices, trade football cards... Like you when you were young. - Afternoon. - Hello. - The town hall, please? - You're looking a tit. I'm the mayor. You don't get this close to politician sin the city. - I brought my son here on holiday. - What an idiot! That's great. Thanks! At least here are two kids your age in the village. Cousin Rafa's kids. You're going to have a blast with them. Cousin Rafa was the joker of the group. Areal gas! She said she couldn't stand living in this god for sakes village anymore, that she needed the excitement of the big city. So she left. - She went to Madrid? - No, to Astorga. And couldn't you have gone with her? She has a new boyfriend. At least you have the kids. They're with her. I haven't seen them in a year. A kiss for your cousin, Nico? No? OK, later then. - So you're completely alone? - I think that's obvious. - No need to rub it in. - No, I'm here to help. But you have to do your bit. Just look at the state of you... Those clothes... You smell bad too. You look like a tramp, Rafa. You have to look after yourself and diet is essential to that. We are what we eat. Have you heard of Thermocook? It's the only thing Julia left. Well, look on the bright side. She must have felt something for you. - Her boyfriend's a chef. - I'm sorry, cuz! Watch it! - You're hurting me. - Sorry. I miss her so much. The suction pads keep it real steady while you're cooking. Well, looks like kids give this place a wide berth. But we're going to have a good time. Look! The best video game ever made! A game of skill and strategy. Let me hook it up! That's it. I'm going to kick your ass! And I haven't played in ages. How sweet! The father, the son and the holy ghost. What are you doing? Turn it off! Turn it off! You know how much power that uses? 1 kW a minute! An ampere an hour. You'll blow the fuses! You're so wasteful! - But... - We have to save. One day you have it all and the next, nothing. Good grief! Idiots! Great holiday! Mom, I can't take it anymore! I'm surrounded by old people! My cheeks hurt from all the pinching! I spoke to your uncle. He invited you to go to Morocco with your cousins. - Tell him... - Who? Your father. To take you to the port in Algeciras, at five. OK, thanks Mom. Love you. I miss you. Bye. Nico, Aunty's made dinner. The steak's so thin, it cook sin no time. What are you doing? Talking to Mom. She says I can go on holiday with my uncle. So you'd rather go away with your uncle than your father? - What? - You heard! You promised me the best holiday ever! You lied! I studied so hard. And this holiday... is fucking bullshit! Nico! Comeback here! Did you just swear? Thank God! I was worried. You never swear and then you get straight As. I thought you were in need of the rap! But you swore! Give me a hug! You're normal! Plus, you're right. You're not a country boy, but it's a shame, the village fair's soon. You'd have won all the races, I'm sure. I'll take you to your uncle. You deserve a good holiday. - It's like a sauna in here. - I can't breathe! Hang on, let me get some thing. Here we go. These things use a lot of electricity. Chernobyl exploded thanks to one of these. But it's just for one night. The light... Turn off the light. OK, time to catch that ferry. Hang on, don't rush off! I made you some sandwiches for the journey. Thanks, Aunty. - You shouldn't have. - I am generous, I know. It's just bread. The healthiest kind! Pure gluten. You're always moaning everything has palm oil in it. We're in the palm of your hand! OK, let's go, Nico. Thanks again. See you! See you soon! And if not, no problem! Those sons of b...! - Hello? - Good afternoon. This is Capital Credit. Francisco Montejo? Yes. It's Capital Credit. - Yes? - Hello, Mr. Montejo. The thing is, you've missed another loan payment. Mariana! You're going to scare the boy with that funny voice! - I'm sorry? - She's always joking around. Mr. Montejo, this isn't a joke. We're going to have to blacklist you. Oh Mariana, you are funny! I can't talk now, I'm driving and I don't want to set a bad example. Talk later. - Mr. Montejo? - Hang up. Are you OK, Dad? Mariana's a security guard and she's always bored. - What are you going to do, Dad? - Whom? Visit some of the villages around here. I've heard there's a beautiful ravine. You're going to have a great time. I'm sure of it. Look! Your uncle. Listen, I want you to be have yourself, OK? - Dome proud. - Come on, Nico! - Dad, I'll stay here if you like. - If you buy anything in the souk, remember they like to hike up the prices. Goon, off you go. - Get him back safely. - Don't you worry! And turn of their wi-fi, it's going to fry their brains. This damn car... Dad! You forgot to put it in first gear! - Didn't you get on the boat? - And miss the best holiday ever? Come on, jump in! Start the engine! Go, go! Quick, get in! Dad! What I mom say when she finds out you missed the boat? You seemed so sad, Dad. Don't worry. I'll tell her it was my idea. I don't want you fighting because of me. We never fight. Never be cause of you. We just have different opinion son somethings. Life, for example. - Are you going to split up? - No, of course not. Your teacher was right when she said you liked hyperbole. It's just a time-out. - Time out? - Just a short break. It's temporary. Just a bit of distance. I'd never divorce your mom. She might divorce me, but your mom's the most wonderful woman in the world. And divorces cost a fortune. - Does Mom want to be with you? - Yes. She just doesn't know it yet. I'll show her we're better together. - When? - Soon. - How soon? - Very soon. - Hurry up, Dad! - These things take time. No, hurry! Here comes the owner! Start the engine, I'll push! Quickly, quickly! Go, go! Hey, asshole! - What the...? - Go, go! I'm going to kick your ass! Go, go! Tell me that you love me. Tell me that you love me. Nobody understands the in justices of the tax system. They're very unsupportive. - Where are we going, Dad? - Somewhere... Somewhere amazing, you'll see. But first, a quick stop. An entrepreneur ever rests, even on holiday. "THE STORK" RESORT - Bungalows! - Very nice bungalows. They look really nice. This is going to be good. Hi, I'm a sales man with Cookfrei. Do you know who the owner is? Hello? Do you hear me? She picks up less signal than a wooden antenna! Look! Progress! Where can I find the owner? Great. What's your name? What's your name? Laura. Nico, stay with Laura while I take care of business, OK? Hi. Zoe, sweetie, selective silence is a temporary condition. Laura will get over it. Yeah? When? She's been like this for seven months, Alicia. You have to be patient. We've tried cognitive behavioral theories, Gestalt, - even hypnosis... - Yeah, yeah. We've tried everything, but Laura's still not talking. She doesn't communicate or socialize. She's sad... Alicia, her behaviors very strange. - Sorry, are you the owner? - Just a second, please. - I know... - Alicia. Laura told me I could find the owner here. I'm hereon business. What? Did you say my daughter... spoke to you? If by spoke you mean she moved her lips and sound came out... yes. - Where is she? - Over there with my son. Good heavens! This is amazing! How old are you? The mirrored neuron effect. It old you so. - No. - Yes, I did tell you. Who cares? It's working! - It's a miracle! - It's my job. I don't believe it. Yeah, two kids who've just met, talking like old friends. It's like an episode of X-Files! Why won't you talk? Are you being punished? Are you sad? You are sad. Well, if you need anything, I'm here So, how did you communicate with Laura? Any tiny detail, as silly as it may seem, could be important. - You might not agree. - But it is. I didn't do anything special. Come on, please. She's been silent for seven months, and you say you did nothing? You must have done something, a gesture, a word. Please, help us. I just walked over to her and asked her her name. She didn't answer. I asked again, louder: "What's your name?" She laughed. What your daughter need sis a doctor to get the wax out of her ear! She must have a candle in there! Mystery solved! Now can I tell you about this fantastic...? - Zoe, come here. - I'd like to talk with you. Please don't go anywhere. I've got nowhere else to go. That man is primitive, simple, basic, normal. He affects conventional patients in a way similar to primates. He gets directly inside - the temporal lobe, see? - I see. We have to get him to interact more with Laura. You have to get him to stay. You can do it! Yes, you can! I can smell the book deal! She's such a pain in the ass! - Curro. - Sorry, Curro. Would you like to stay here at the resort? - We've already got plans. - As my guests, of course. - I'd have to cancel our fights, zumba classes... - All expense paid! - Oh, goon then... Nico, surprise! - We staying here for our vacation! - Cool! The part about all expenses paid was true? - Of course. - I told you, speedster! - That way. - Curro! - Daniela, honey! - Where are you? In an Eco Resort, it's all nature and health! How many loans did you take now? - All free. I got my values back! - You got them back? - Look, Nico, say hi to Mom. - Hi, Mom! People need places like this. They need healing vacations. We do all kind soft therapies here. They garden, trim the bonsais... And they do everything whilst meditating. - Silence. You hear that? - No. Exactly... Look, look. That's David, an executive off work for depression. - He was drowning in Prozac. - A bath room trip works for me. We even have therapy for that. - Really? - Yes. Some people really benefit from the Ayurvedic diet. Others fast. So they come to look after vegetables they won't eat and they don't complain - because they can't talk? - Yes. - They pay for this? - 700 a night. - Hat's off to you! - Thank you. Namaste, dear flock. - Usha! Namaste. - Little lamb. - Usha, this is Curro. - Usher, hi. - Usha. - Oh, Usha. Our yoga teacher and cook. Interesting! You like to experiment with food? - Of course. - I've got a machine that will... Sorry. No technology here. Only natural and manual here. Follow me. Today we have quinoa, kamut and tofu extract. And these book marks? - Can I have some bread? - No bread. - No... - Gluten is deadly. It's poison. To take care of yourself, you have to cut out gluten. And what else should I get rid of? Not much. Gluten. - Fried foods. - Caffeine. - Sugar. - Cold meats. - Drugs and alcohol. - Red meat, seafood. Don't make that face. There's still plenty to eat. I've lost the will! There's spelt, quinoa, kamut, seaweed. - And lettuce! A classic. - Lettuce... That was for the rabbit sin my house. Lettuce needs washing. It's full of dirt and bugs fuc... Doing the wild thing! Look, forget all that business, 'cos cooking can be summarized in one word, Thermocook. Congratulations. I'm going to yoga. - Yoga! You coming? - Sure. Inhale. Let's do the cobra. Reston your ulnae. Face down, Curro. And... rise up. - I'll do the lizard. I'm a be ginner. - Not so flexible? No, too many organs. I'm full up. Try to lift your shoulder sup a bit. - What do I need my shoulders for? - Backwards, Curro! - Look, Usher. - Usha. I've got tile syndrome, I'm easier to break than bend. And I've got another. Could you give me a massage? Yes, well... I'm rather busy. I'm Zoe's guest! A friend. Goon, you can fit me in. I'll just stay here until you're done. Ow, Usha! Learn to breath, Curro. I'm 52 years old. I can't be that bad atit! Yesterday I was telling you... You need two food processors. They'll.. shit! Careful! Damn Ayur-doctor! - Turn over. - And just think, you could spend time in the garden while this wonder machine works in the kitchen. Careful! I'm a bit out of shape, Usha. That's it. Is this pleasure, or absence of pain? But two of those food processors... Sleep, little bison. - Damn, Usha. - Laura! Laura, no. Laura! - No, no, Laura. - Laurita, please! - What's wrong? - Laura's climbed that tree. At least the tree didn't climb her. We're working on emotional grounding. Every time we mention her father, she climb sit and spends all day up there. She won't even come down for dinner. It's exhausting! Try asking her to come down? Hey, come down! No, please. That tree is her emotional refuge, her nucleus, her life jacket. Her life jacket. - And we have to respect that. - Laura. What are you doing? Let's go swimming. Why not? Then I'll have to come up. Nico, you're a city boy! And you're scared of heights. The boundary. Don't enter the nucleus! Don't go up there! Oh my God. No... She needs her space, God damn it! Damn kid! I'm going to give him a... It's so high up here! - I'd help you down, if I knew how. - Nico, get down, please! How can I get down? Don't look down? But I'm going to fall if I don't look. I could've done it myself. And what do you call that? That... I knew about that, of course. Dr. Oklajander talks about this very thing, using the patient's innate empathy as a way to form a bond. And Dr. Montejo talks about the wonders of not pressuring kids! - Works every time. - Montejo? Of course... Dr. Montejo. You know, Laura's dad never made her laugh. He was so serious. But she adored him. All the problems started when he left us. I didn't know. May he rest in peace. I don't know if he's at peace, but he's surrounded by cows for sure. - Cows? - He left us... To go to India. He sent us a Whats App and never came back. Out of the blue. He must be busy in India, with all the cows and tourists. When he left, Laura started to be come with drawn and stopped talking. I don't know if to punish me or if it's a trauma. I just don't know. Sorry. When I get going I... I won't bore you anymore with this. That's OK, we're here to listen. You've no idea what it's like. Did I mention the nightmares? Talking of nightmares, I should get some sleep. They we're terrible! We've tried meditation, acupuncture, Bach flowers, cutting out gluten and lactose. Nothing worked. Have you tried going back in time and having Freud examine her? You coming here is a gift. It's been a turning point for Laura. You need more reflection and less talking. But I said... One thing leads to the other, if you get my drift. Meditate on that for a bit. See you later. - Usha. - Welcome to... Oh, Curro! - Wow! Night yoga. - No, it's not exactly yoga, but people will be here soon, so if you don't mind... I just need a second to show you this wonder, The Thermocook ZTX 3000. It cooks, mixes, kneads, grinds... Why don't you tell me later? I'm very busy now. Tomorrow. - Tomorrow? - Yes. - You sure? - Yes. - Is 11 OK? - 11 is perfect. - Or 11.30 if you want a lie-in. - 11 is OK. You spiritual folk like your sleep. - OK, 11.30. See you tomorrow. - Perfect. - This calls for a drink! - No! This liquor of yours tastes amazing. Curro! He just downed a shot of Ayahuasca! - What? - Two. - Delicious! - No, no, no. - What's wrong? - Curro, Ayahuasca is a very powerful hallucinogen. - Therapeutic. This isn't Ibiza! - Oh my God! How are you feeling, David? Calmer? - Yes. - How's the anxiety? - Faraway. - Faraway, good. We're liberating the energetic blockages. - Did that hurt? - Yes. Don't worry, it's normal. - Should we call an ambulance? - No, no ambulances. Let it flow. Let it flow? Do you think he's feeling it yet? Just a moment. Little bison, are you OK? - He looks OK. - What? He's fine Zoe, he's fine. Look. He only took a little bit and he's a big guy. He had a big dinner, I doubt he'll even feel it. I can fly! I'm an eagle! Where's National Geographic? No, you can't. Comedown. - I can! I'm flying away! - Comedown! Get down now! Trust me, I know what I'm doing. OK, David. I'm going to leave you alone for a moment. - OK, David? - OK. Breath and channel. Breath and channel. Breath and channel. I wasn't sure about the Se needles at first, but I think I'm starting to relax. I feel calm. Like a... Hedgehog! Dad, why do we have to leave? A few days with these hippies is enough. My head hurts. - Laura invited me... - I don't care. Son, they drugged me. But Laura invited me to her grandma's house. Just imagine the grandmother! Energy, therapy, reiki, teas... We'll end up hugging trees and playing the tambourine. No! We're leaving. Zoe, Laura's in the last stage of mourning her abandonment. She just needs a little push. She's one step away from being cured. You have to get them to stay. - I tried talking to him, but... - No buts, remember. By saying but, you're unconsciously resisting. Alicia! Trust yourself. Where there's a will there's away! I'm going to get fired. Come on, son. It's going to be hard to get the car started. Curro, Curro! Isn't there anything I can say to convince you to come with us? If I stay here any longer, I'll forget what the word "income" means. Please reconsider. My mom has a beautiful house with a pool. She lives in a residential area with lots of kids. Nico and Laura will have a great time. And there'll be other families with house sand kitchens, right? - Yes, of course. - Where did you say it was? - I didn't. It's in Marbella. - Marbella! - Please, Dad! - Please, please, please! We've already got plans. OK, just for a few days. - Great! - But only so I can meet your mom. - Thank you. - Laura. But if we're going to stay a few days, I'd like to make something clear. - All expenses paid. - That's important! I want to discuss something else. I love my wife very much. We're going through a bad patch, but we're going to work it out. So if you feel an urge or wild sexual attraction, a connection, magnetism, heat, you're going to have to repress it. This space here between us, we have to maintain it. Marbella, how cool! Laura, who do you want to go to Marbella with you? It's thanks to who you're much better and starting to talk again? Laura, who's been here for seven months working hard to help you find your voice under that emotional shield of yours, honey? Crazy girl! The cat got her tongue again. Have fun! See? You have to be optimistic. Your father always has a plan for everything. Dad, this place doesn't look very hippy. Hippy? Bet they fine you for farting round here! - Mom! - Hi, darting! So good to see you. - This is Curro and Nico. - Hi. Nice to meet you. - Indeed. - "Chardonnay". Just Juliet is fine. Looking at this house, I almost wish my name was Romeo! Zoe warred me about your sense of humor. Eva, can you take the guests up to their room, please? - "Chardonnay", "chardonnay". - Yes, "chardonnay". Zoe, whereon earth did you find that scarecrow? At a market? Laura, darting, how are you? Mute. The lady asked me to prepare you a room in the south wing. As long a sour heads are pointing north, no problem. The French prime minister stayed here not long ago. I hope the sheets have been changed. Do you have any allergies? Are you gluten or lactose in tolerant? The boy has a strange illness. All his food needs to have been made in a Thermocook. Dad. But, I can get you one at Avery reason able price. - We have the latest model. - Of course you do. There's just one problem, the air ionizer's broken. What? Nico, we're leaving. The air ionizer's broken. - This is intolerable. - Dad, humility. You're right, son. Humility. Les sis more. We'll be serving drinks on the terrace at six. - Enjoy your stay. - Thank you. Wait! I forgot. You wouldn't have any change? - 8 would be great, but 7 will do. - Good grief! Look at her! How long since you've seen her like this? Along time. And this Curro, is he going to stay long? I don't know, as long as it takes. He's certainly made himself at home. Look at him scratching himself. He's so uninhibited. How are you, darting? You're looking radiant a sever! Hello, Victor! Zoe. So nice to see you again. Really lovely! Sorry for interrupting, but seeing as you're both here, you can sign off the purchase of Capital Credit. Capital Credit? That company's on it's knees! - And you are? - Curro Montejo, it's a pleasure. This is Victor, he's... - My partner. - My mom's partner, and the manager of our estate. I hope he's a better lover than manager. - Excuse me? - Capital Credit's days a renumbered. Are you some kind of financial expert? - Yes. Although I'm not working as such. - Right. I have it on good authority that they've been giving loans to anyone, and when I say anyone... With no guarantees or anything. I mean I get why people do it, it optimizes your APR. - You know what APR is? - Annual percentage rate. They'll be bankrupt in a year. Mark my words. Who is this man? Juliet, enjoy your old age and forget Capital Credit. - What old age? - Victor. - I'm going to think it over. - You won't sign. Curro, we're having an lbizan party tonight and I want you to come as my guests. Thank you. You can tell I'm a party man! Hey, Morales! How's it going? You seem calm given you haven't made a single sale. Don't you worry about me! You're going to get fired. - Tonight I'm going to a posh party Everyone will betaking a Thermocook home! Everyone? You're delusional. As if! Everyone! Jerk! Give me that! - Zoe didn't sign the papers. - Why not? She let some idiot advise her. Who? A prestigious economist, or ex minister? That guy over there. I can't see, that jerk's in the way. He is the jerk. What? Dad, why is everyone in white and so dressed up? No idea. I was told it was an lbizan party. - Ibiza has...? - Beaches. - And what are we wearing? - Beachwear. We're not here to make a fashion statement, we're here to network. Watch and learn. Good evening. Curro Montejo, salesman. That guy screwed up a million-euro deal. He must be a wolf of Wall Street, who knows? Hello, good evening. Curro Montejo, salesman. Dad, give me some to hand out. I like your initiative, son! - Curro Montejo, salesman. - Excuse me. Good evening. Do you cook? My cooks cook. I own the restaurant at the entrance to the town. Great! So call me, because this is a kitchen revolution bigger than the discovery of fire! Thank you. Thanks. - Curro! How's it going? - Hit here! Wow! Love the shirt! Ibiza style for the party. - Yes, and I won't lose you! - Exactly. - And Nico? - He's learning the trade. - He's amazing! - Curro Montejo, salesman. I won't ask. Let's get a drink. - Let's get a drink. - OK! Curro Montejo, salesman. - Hi, Zoe. - Jorge, how are you? Curro, this is Jorge. - A friend of my dad's. - Hi. Hi.Allow me to introduce my wife, Vanessa. - Hello. - Hi. - My daughter, Carmen. - Nice to meet you. But... - And the little one is... - Don't tell me! Your grandmother? Shall we dance? See you later, Jorge. Ciao. The people at this party are strange. And the music! - Do you like it? - Very modern. She's a famous DJ. She mixes electro chill with... Electro chill? This is a party? Look around you! - It's dead! I'll have a word. - Curro, Curro! Don't make a scene! Put some tune son, woman! Boney M, Tino Casal, Rafael. Liven this party up a bit. Look, it's dead! That guy's an ass! We'll have to sell it all. Impossible! Do you know how much that would cost us? I can't force the hippy to sign! Where'd that guy get his information from? Maybe he's a big shot? Yes, really... Hold my drink. What's all this? Raising my blood pressure, squashing my dreams, carry on like that and you'll see. - Come on, Zoe! - Everyone's looking at us. Dance, Zoe. I look at my watch, it's much later than yesterday. I'd wait for you again but I won't, I won't. Where's our unfix able mistake? Was it your fault or mine? Not you, nor anyone, can change me. Slow-mo! Big shot? He looks like a big jerk! Well, who knows? As if millionaires were the height of elegance! Look at Donald Trump! Find some dirt on him. Come on, Laura! Come on! Let's dance. Come on, come on! A thousand bells are ringing in my heart. It's so hard to say sorry. Not you, nor anyone, can change me. Where's our unfix able mistake? Was it your fault or mine? Not you, nor anyone, can change me. A thousand bells are ringing in my heart! I had a great time at the party. Everyone was boring, but we danced it up real good! Especially you, Curro. You dance well for being so small. - I like singing, dancing... - Bed time! Tell her! She won't shut up! Grandma wants me to learn ballet, but it's boring. We know that you haven't spoken for ages but... - Funky's much better. - Laura... Look at this hip-hop step. Listen, Laura! - Laura, come here. - Yes? What is it? Laura, remember how your father not being around traumatized you and stopped you from speaking? - But... - Well stop speaking! Are you mute again yet? OK. Go to sleep and let us get some rest. Go in peace and leave us in comfort! I'll turn your volume back up tomorrow. Lights out and get to sleep. The sweet sound of silence! - Dad. - What? - This vacation is pretty cool. - As promised. I hope Mum comes next year! Laura, honey. What's wrong now? - Has some thing happened? - No. Laura, would you like a croissant or panettone? How's it going? Good morning! Morning! Sorry we're up so late, but Laura had us up chatting all night! She wouldn't shut up! - She's quiet now! - Yesterday she was non-stop! We had to put heron silent mode! It's these gad gets' fault. Give me that. People die taking selfie sin cliffs! No phone makes a big difference. A thousand bells are ringing in my... - Heart. - That's my girl! Juliet, take my advice! - I just don't get it. - I'll keep this. Let's have some breakfast! There's fruit and bacon! I like a hearty breakfast! Mom, this is the best vacation ever! I'm so glad to hear that, honey. Let me speak to him. - Who? - Your father. OK. Bye, Mom. You see? He's having more fun than a pig in shit! OK, I was wrong. Wrong? I didn't think that word was in your vocabulary! See how you have be optimistic? OK! Lots of love. That's the nicest thing you've said since "Hang up, this must be costing a fortune". Bye! He's such an idiot! Everything OK, Dad? I'm smiling like an idiot. That's the best smile there is! She laughed too. She pretends to be tough, but she always succumbs to my charms. Like on our first date. - What did you do? - What didn't I do? A fancy dinner, then a drive in a convertible. We watched the sunrise. All that was missing was a violinist! - Whatever! - What? You don't know what your dads capable of, kid! Look at us, Nico. Here we are with these rich people. On this fabulous yacht. But this isn't happiness. No, son, no. - Happiness is something else. - What, Dad? Happiness is... That! Check out that yacht! What a yacht! Two engines, four pools, twenty cabins! - Dad! - You always have to dream big. The bigger, the better! Remember that! The bigger, the better! Zoe, I've spoken to Victor. Good. Communication is the key to a good relationship. Darting, I understand that this... Curro? Yes, Curro. That crudeness he has, that vulgarity, may have a positive effect on Laura, but I can't believe that man's an expert in finance. Neither in finance nor basic Spanish. - He's primitive, uncouth. - Mom! - Archaic. - Mom! I don't like Victor's advice. Victor's been working in finance his whole life. Curro probably thinks Dow Jones is a pop singer. Zoe, look! - Capital Credit's gone bust! - What? Yup! It's gone to shit! And who warred you? Yours truly! The stock market legend! The lBEX55 guru! - Thank God I took your advice! - Yes! - Victor! Look, Victor. - What? Capital Credit's gone down the tubes. Who saved you a million euros? Yours truly! - Who is this guy? - Everyone's in the know here. Looks like my uncouth friend saved our ass. My God! He sure did! You know what? From no won I'm not signing any thing with out his approval. I'm telling you. Oh, Zoe! - Zoe, do you have a second? - Yes. I need you to have a look at this paperwork about selling your dad's company. OK. I will. Your mom and I have spent a longtime on it and we need your signature. - OK. I'll read through it all. - Sure, read through it. But sign. What's up, Morales? Weren't you supposed to have sold something? I'm getting there. You? Swimming in sales? High level contacts take time to consolidate. Well get consolidating. You'll need those contacts when you get fired. Who's going to fire me? You're last, Montejo. You're the worst salesman in all of Spain. Last? What about the others? They couldn't sell a witch a broomstick! They rolled their sleeves up. I might start feeling sorry for you. - Very funny. - You know me. What job can you get at your age? Pizza delivery? I'd deliver them in your face. Shit! He didn't find it funny. - Dad, put your suit on. - My suit? Why? A good salesman never rests, right? Son, you're right! Marbella, here we come! - What are we doing here, Dad? - Remember that beach party? Ibizan party. I met the owner there and I want to talk business with her. - Hello, Sir. - Hello. Curro Montejo, Cookfrei salesman. I'd like to speak to the owner. She isn't here yet. Would you like to wait inside? - OK, inside. - Table for two? I see you can count! Dad, this place is awesome! Thank you. Here's the wine list and the menu. No, just a coke for him and a beer for me, until the boss arrives. - No food? Maybe just some thing to nibble on. We have a tasting menu... Any old snack will do. Just don't forget the beer. Waiter! I'm thirsty. I've got news about Zoe's new adviser. That guy's been cleaning out banks for years. Toledo, Ciudad Real, Cuenca, Albacete. - Of course, the accounts. - The carpets! Today we have an iodized alginatesphere. Is this food or a nuclear physics lesson? Bring me some thing simpler. He got a BBA from a distance learning university. It took him 10 years. Which explains why he works selling Thermocooks. - What's that? A new kind of fund? - A food processor. Liquid ravioli with garlic in fused beef. Ravioli? You could bring them all at the same time, save you going back and forth! The guy's a loser! He's a loser. Lentil air with pepper. Only the pepper for me. I'm already familiar with the lentil air! Well, a loser we need on our side. The good thing is now we know what this idiot wants. They get carried a way with names in these places. Imagine a crunchy sphere of bechamel with domestic bird aroma. - What's that? - A chicken croquette! Wait, don't tell me! This one's easy. Ice cream illusion on textured papyrus. It's the check, Sir. 100 euros for three bar snacks? This is what I spent on my wedding reception! - It's haute-cuisine. - Haute and barely there! Let me explain something. Remember at the gas station? How could I forget? Well, the same tax in equality applies - in the restaurant business. - Don't say anymore. We have to leave without paying. We're seeing that justice is done! Speed up. Quick, or we'll get caught! Let's go, Nico! Running is saving! They didn't follow us. OK then... Anymore running and I'll have liver failure! We'll try again tomorrow, Dad. Don't worry. We might have to change towns. Let me worry about that. Go for a swim, I'll be right there. Don't forget your sunscreen! I won't! - What? Bad news? - It's... You know. - Because the lBEX is down? - Yes. The lBEX 55 couldn't be any lower. Shall we have a coffee? I've been observing you. A man of your talent, with such great people skills, you must be a salesman. - To be a salesman you have to sell. - Yes. See this brochure? For you. Use it for a wonky table. Jorge and I have a high-end apart hotel company. - I expected nothing less. - 300. Wow, I didn't expect so much! We were thinking of kitting them out with these. Either through the company, or through you. You'd get a good commission. A tidy sum. Well, damn, Victor! I had you down as a self-interested creep. Yes, I had a similar feeling about you, but no. I need you to help me out a bit with Zoe. Apart from my son and my wife, you can ask me for anything. She really trusts you. But me, I'm her mom's boyfriend, it's trickier. Like Cinderella and the evil stepmother, but yuppie-style! I don't get it. Anyway, the thing is we need to approve a company sale. The restructuring plan I've prepared is impeccable. But I need you to help with Zoe, she might have some doubts. "I don't want quality to go down". "I don't want to fire anyone." As if it were my fault! Sure, the typical hippy, charitable stuff. Like: "I want everyone to have three-month vacations" "and be super happy". And I want a Chinese man to wash my feet! But no. We're businessmen. We know that for a company to flourish, you have to make sacrifices. - Sure. - So then? - Deal? - Deal. And another thing, it's always better if someone else is making the sacrifices. Let go, let go. - Zoe, I need to talk to you. - Now? - I have that meeting. - Exactly. Just a moment. Is he still here? Leave him be. He's not annoying us for once. - I've been thinking... - I've been thinking too. My heart's telling me not to follow Victor's advice. - We're not going to sell the factory. - Well, actually... - I think you should. - What? Trust Victor's judgment. What are you talking about? You know about this stuff. - Like Capital Credit. - But not because I'm an expert. Because I'm poor. Trust Victor. Everything OK? Yes. OK, so the restructuring of the holding company. Votes in favor? - I vote yes, obviously. - Obviously. Zoe? - I vote... - What's your vote? Bad news. The owner shave approved the sale of the factory to the Filipinos. They want to move production there, but we won't let them! While we've still got some dignity left, we're going to... Look! The owners of the company are on TV. We're staying put, 'cos we are the factory Don't go! I'm still talking. - We're here with Victor Montiolivo. - Monteleo, Monteleo. - Moncelio. - Screw you! Son of a bitch! His company to a large Filipino group. We wanted to free up some cash flow so we'd be able to implement... Careful how you stand, the camera adds ten pounds! - Curro, the ham's here, come on. - Ham! - Isn't that your husband? - No. - Yes, it is. - No. OK, it is. I'm going to kill him! Me too! The people you're on holiday with are the owners of our factory. No. They're the owners of Velasco Corp. - That Jimenez Textiles belongs to. - I don't know. - Maybe you're right. - Of course I am. What I'd like to know is what you're doing with that scum. Business, Daniela. I've just sold 300 Thermocooks. I'm going to be manager. AI lour problems are over. - What? - You can forget the strike. - They bribed you! - We exchanged assets. Basically an economic transaction. Stick your transaction where the sun don't shine! You've really screwed up this time. Don't you think you're exaggerating just a bit? Are you there? Bring my son back and... - and forget about me. - Daniela, please. You're being... Everything OK, Dad? Yes, of course. But I think we need to go home. Everything went to plan. It wasn't easy, no. Nico. Don't worry. It doesn't look good. On the bright side, at least he hasn't gone to India. No, but he's acting like a fool. He thinks I don't know what's going on. He's an idiot. They never think we know what's going on. Mom said: "We're not fighting, we're talking". My dad: "I slept on the couch 'cos your mom was snoring". "We're not shouting, we're talking loud". "It's just adult stuff". Do you miss yours? Yes. Well, I don't know. I just want to be sad and for my mom to stop asking me: "Are you OK", "What's wrong?". - I bet. - But your dad will work things out. It's a shame you have to leave. I'm sorry, but my wife and I have something urgent to sort out and... Anyway, sponging off other sis exhausting! We've go teach other's number. You've got my mom's and my dad's and I've got your mom's. - So, we'll talk. - Cool. - Listen, I've... What? - Listen, I've... What? - I've had a great time. - It was cool meeting you. I'm going to miss you. I wanted to ask you for one last favor. - Don't take this the wrong way, but... - What? - It'd be really great if... - Goon. You gave us a push! This old thing is a nightmare to get going! Of course! Come on, Nico! Bye, bye! See you never! Honey, just because Nico and Curro had to leave, doesn't mean they're going to disappear. You can keep in touch. I know, Mom. I'm 11 years old. Besides, I've got Nico's Whats App. That's great! It's Mom. - What does she want now? - To know what time we'll be home. At two, but tell her three, so if we're late, she can't get mad. Tell me what's going on. I've worked like a donkey my whole life, cleaning... Smiling at people who treat me like dirt. Now I have a chance to make something of myself, What does your mom do? Worry about others. So you've put your foo tin it again. I'm up to my knees in it. - So you're getting divorced. - This again? No! Your dad's got it all worked out. Tonight we'll have dinner together like a family. And if we don't, remember your mom always gives you healthy food. With me the closest you get to a vegetable is a carrot cake! Leave it, son. Getting her to change her mind is hard. - Don't take sides. - I'm playing Candy Crush. Ah, OK! Well, you could always mention all this to her. Tell her the fighting affects you. It might seem like nothing now, but it could turn into - a rash later on. - Dad! It has to be you who does something. You're losing Mom and if you lose her, you're going to be in areal mess. What do you know about it? You'd be surprised. You're your mother's son, no doubt. Don't worry, son. Your dad always has a plan. - Nico! - Mom! Look how much you've grown! I want to hear all about your trip. Hello, Daniela. - Can we talk? - There's nothing to talk about. Oh, come on! Wait for me inside. What do you want, Curro? It's raining! - You look great. - Striking's good for the waistline. I made a deal with the factory owners. They've promised to keep five of you on. - What? - Yes, they've done us a real favor. There's you and your friend Sara you like so much, - that other girl who laughs... - Stop! You really think I'm going to take a job while everyone else is laid off? I don't understand you, Daniela. I gave Nico his dream vacation. I've made us some money. I got you your job back. What more do you want? What more do I want? Me? I... I want a divorce. Well, she's not a widow, but divorce will dome. Shut up! Don't worry, Nico. - It's all OK. - I know, Dad. Optimism and beaming sunshine. It didn't go too well then. Not really, no. I thought as much. Dad told me you were tough. He told you what? That it took him ages to win you over. He even told me about your first date. Really? What did he tell you? That he took you for a fancy meal and for a drive in a convertible. What more do you want? Well, that's the Curro Montejo version. It's not true? He changed a couple of details. We did go out for a meal, - but we had to run out. - You did a runner! - You know what that is? - No. Then his car got towed and it wasn't a convertible. The windows were stuck and you couldn't put them up. We had two cans of beer watching the sunrise outside aware house. That was my first date with your father. So then why'd you marry him? I don't know. Because even though it was a disaster, I'd never laughed so much with anybody before. - That's it? - Oh, Nico! When you grow up, you'll understand that you don't need much more in a relationship. Mom! I wish I'd known that before. - What? - Nothing. For he's a jolly good fellow, for he's a jolly good fellow, for he's a jolly good fellow, and so say all of us. How the hell did you do it? And with out a decent suit! Move, Morales. It's time to give him his prize. Come on, Montejo. Congratulations, you're the new regional sales manager. I was 25 when I first go there. And now you must be... Never mind. In 20 years you'll be the big boss. Or you'll be retired by then. I'll leave you to input the numbers of the biggest sale in the company's history! You're an animal! A beast! A titan! - What? - Listen, Victor. - The deal's off. I'm cancel ling the order. - No, no, I'm already with UNICEF. Welcome. We're here to sign off on the sale. I'll read through it in case there are any last minute changes. They're inside about to sign. No to the factory relocation! We're not going to give up! Shit! Start the engine, Carlos. Morales, give the car a push. You want me to sing a song while you drive too? Let me tell you this quickly. I'm giving up the promotion for my wife. So she won't keep thinking I'm an idiot. I really would be an idiot to lose her. And you finished in second place... Put it in first with your foot on the clutch! You can't lose her! Carmela's the woman of your dreams! - Daniela! - Oh! What did I say? As stipulated by the contract, the seller agrees that the buyer shall acquire the totality of the shares, free from all tax obligations. Not for sale! Not for sale! Not for sale! Not for sale! Not for sale! Dad! - What are you doing here? - Protesting with Mom. You? - Saving the factory. - And what else? - The factory. - Answer me! What else? Getting your mother back! Make her laugh like the day your car got towed! - What? - Make her laugh like the day. - OK, boss! - Follow me! Let's go! No to relocation! We are the factory! Not for sale! We're not giving up! This factory isn't for... Curro! - Shit! - What are you doing here? I think I can save the factory. - How? Look at everyone. - No idea, but I have to try. Get us inside. Let's go. I'm one of you! Initial each page and sign attendee. You can't understand me, but who cares? - Curro, you'd better have a plan. - When have I ever not had a plan? - Never! - Always! Awesome! Optimism, Daniela, optimism. What optimism? Take a look behind you. - Curro! - Zoe, I have to talk to you. Out! I'll call the police! Enough stupid stunts! Victor! Let him talk. Thank you. Thank you. "Arigato". Zoe, look... - I told you to sell 'cos he bribed me. - Here we go! He what? He promised to buy 300 food processors from me. - He bribed you? - Just business! Business? I'm starting to think I'm like a mirror. Yes... Because everyone who gets close tome is only looking out for themselves. Go ahead, laugh. Everyone does. You don't have a clue of what I'm saying. Thank you, Curro. Thanks for reminding me I can't trust everyone. - This is a joke! - Look, Zoe. The truth is you shouldn't trust me or Victor, or any other adviser. Zoe, you've managed to make money from a hippy camp. - Eco Resort - Fine, whatever. You can make any company a success. Just trust your instinct, be true to yourself. That's what I'm going to do. And now I'm going to ask you one last favor. Don't sell Jimenez Textiles. It's a good company that employs a lot of good people. My wife is one of them. None of them deserve to lose their jobs. And even though you'd make a lot of money, some things are worth more. What a shitty speech. - It's your choice, Zoe. - What? What? My English isn't so good. I'm not signing. - She's not signing! - She's not signing. I don't understand! Dad did it! It's great! Congratulations! I'm sorry, honey. I've been a prize idiot. - And selfish. - That too. Ole! You're a real idiot, Curro. I can't deny it. You're totally right. Nico. Are you OK? - But you saved the factory. - No. You and your friends did that by putting up a fight. I had nothing to do with that. Curro Montejo! I haven't had time to screw up again! Yes! Dad! Come here, kid? - Little monster! - My baby. MY PARENTS And that's how my dad saved the factory. Zoe made my mom head of design and now she has her own office. And Zoe and Laura came to live in Toledo, so now we see each other at school. The rich guys are in jail, for keeping their money in a haven or something like that. As for my dad, well, let's just say he be came a fan of Thermocook and is at home more now. But most important of all, the three of us are together again. What a happy ending! Great! And that's how the best summer of my life ends. Oh no, sorry! It hasn't finished yet. - What happened to your aunty? - No idea. The neighbor said they'd found her collapsed on the floor like a log. Maybe it was heatstroke? It's really dry out here. 89, 89. - Dad, what's wrong with her? - Remember we forgot to turn off the air. Well this is the bill. Look. Wow! 89 euros. 89 euros! - Stay calm, aunty. - Breathe deeply. This machine's controlling your blood pressure and keeping you alive. - Is it electric? - Of course, it's not a street organ! - Unplug it. - No, Aunty. - Unplug it. - No. - I'll try to find a gas one. - Unplug it. No, Aunty. Life is a gift. I won't be an accomplice to murder. - Do it! Unplug the damn thing. - No, no! I'm not going to unplug it! - Unplug it! - Enough! Curro, what have you done? I think I've just committed "euthanasi aunt". I'm alive! OK, cut! We'll do another take. Number 26. A bit more serious this time, please? 34-1-1. Camera! You'll go around telling everyone that Curro Montejo is your father. I know who your son is. These are his... These are... These are his grades. Ouch! Shit. Sorry. What job can you get at...? Argh! It's Eco... Eco... Dammit! Well... cut! I'm unscrupulous! I'm mad! No, Montejo, no. Motivation. We've got... Zombies are after us! I'm going to make the dinner. You should skip it, though! - Euro Disney? - Cold! Take that! What are you doing? Turn it off! Turn it off! Don't laugh! I don't understand you!
