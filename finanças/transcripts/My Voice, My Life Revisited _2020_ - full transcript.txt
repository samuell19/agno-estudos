In 2013, the documentary My Voice, My Life followed a group of students from three under-performing high schools and a school for the visually impaired in Hong Kong as they discovered a different side to themselves through the magic of theater. Tonight we're going to work on spacing. We'll try "the Medley" so you can get a feel for the space. As they venture into adulthood, how are these students doing now? What are their struggles, triumphs, and failures? Jason Chow (Ah Bok) Coby Wong Sio Fan Lam Curtis Tsz Nok Lin Summer of 2013 The stage and the theater... Have any of you participated before? If you have, you'll know this is a place of magic and emotion. But what's most important is it's a chance for you to grow. Find yourself and discover what it is you love, and find out what your strengths and weaknesses are. It's a process of self-discovery. Being in this musical, as I've said before, I've made a lot of friends. All four of us... All four of us have made a bunch of new friends. Isn't it the four of us? All of us have made new friends. Jason Chow (Ah Bok) I used to be really impulsive. I always wanted to be upfront. When I went out, everyone knew I was up for it. I fight till I win. Summer of 2019 When did you buy this car? When did I buy this car? Last month. Does it mean you can sleep in a bit? No. I don't usually sleep in. It just means I don't have to walk. Did I mess around a lot at school? I don't think so, I was just a bit naughty. I liked to boss people around. I was a bit of a bully. I thought it was better that way. But then people label you as bad. I really was a bit of a bad boy back then. So things weren't so good. You have to have a fire within you. If you don't have a fire within you, how can you sing this song? I've already told you two to stand still. You're still moving around. You're not just moving, you're also grinning stupidly. Will I one day be able to say, "Ah Bok, you've done well." "Ah Bok, you've really progressed." Don't you want to be praised like that? I went into the toilet during break. I heard three of the boys talking and smelled cigarette smoke. I asked what was going on. They had nothing to say. I asked him not to do it again, but he did it again. I was very disappointed. I told him right away that I didn't want him back. I wanted to talk to you today to tell you that we still believe in you. I didn't feel grateful back then. I took things for granted. Now I'm older, I'm no longer like that. People treat you well because you're lucky. I was really lucky. So I need to be grateful. They're Ah Bok's parents. - Hello, Mr. Chow. - Hello, Mr. Ho. Ah Bok is always talking about you. Everyone always talks about him. Even my family thought I was unteachable, a hopeless case. Ah Bok has really improved... Ah Bok's turning point was the second time I caught him smoking. Since then, his attitude has been good. If I hadn't done the musical, I wouldn't be the person I am today. I wouldn't have wanted to be a social worker, for one thing. I also wouldn't have changed my bad attitude. It would have got worse, because I wouldn't have had anyone helping me. When we started rehearsing I said it in front of the camera. I told a lot of people that I want to change. I want my family to see me change. Today I want to tell you all, and tell my family something. I've really done it, I've really changed. Those young people will never forget the summer of 2013. It taught them a lot. How much depends on how they develop in the future. When they leave school and enter society, they'll all face challenges. How they cope depends on how determined and positive they are. I've worked in a kitchen. Now I live by myself, I've become quite a good cook. I've been a driver, I've worked on a building site, in a bar, and... As a waiter. I've done lots of jobs. So many kinds. In my last one, I was an office boy. I got fired, because I clocked off exactly on time. So that taught me I couldn't just do my hours. I couldn't just leave if the boss was still working. I play darts. I've played for years. I've even played for the Hong Kong team. This is a league prize called Top Player. I was the one with the highest number of wins in the group. It's some kind of achievement at least... a ranking. But it can't pay for school or cover my living costs and hobbies. It's hard. So I've decided to get my diploma. I've got to take a full-time job first. Then I can go part time and restart my studies. That would be perfect. It won't be easy, but I can hack it. There's a lot of traffic. Hello. Do you want to cook this evening? I'm in the car with Ruby filming. What time will you be here? Do you want to be on camera? No! You do it. - OK. Bye. - OK. Bye. I haven't opened a door with a key for ages. My home in Cheung Sha Wan uses fingerprints. He lives so close by. He's always coming over for dinner. He moved out about a year ago. - More than that. - Isn't it? It's been about two years now. How has he changed? How has he changed? He's better behaved. He uses his brain. He's finally grown up. He's learnt how to use his brain. There were so many things, I couldn't keep nagging him. I think he's clearer about his path now. I remember he wanted to be a social worker. I'm now working at a school as a discipline assistant. It's been about two years now. I mainly coach the students on things like conduct and behavior. I didn't know how to communicate with him before. Since starting this job, he's learnt how to talk to kids with empathy, and show them it's possible to change, that they have it in them. Do you have any advice for young people? If you want to mess around, do it when you're young. You can't do it when you're older. It's a necessary part of growing up. Don't limit yourself to your own narrow world. Go out and experience more. Your character changes things. Or rather, your attitude can change things. I think both of these are important. It doesn't matter if you're good at school or not. What matters is the kind of person you are. Great! That was great. I really like what he just said. He made some good points. - Don't go overboard. - Son. You did great! The Awakening was in 2013. It's been six years. It was a happy time. Unforgettable. Although there are some things that I'm a bit hazy about now. Like if you asked me to recite my lines, I honestly wouldn't be able to do it. I do remember that we were a team all working together towards a common goal. The happiest thing I've done... and the one thing I'd love to do again is The Awakening. The night is full of magic and excitement, Dusk takes us to a land of indulgence, As wine pumps through our veins. Kim is the most important character and appears throughout the musical. To play Kim, we've chosen Coby! Isn't Kim a boy's part? It's a girl. Can't you tell the difference? I never expected I'd get it. I never thought I was any good at anything: singing, dancing, acting. Why would they choose me? Turn, and down. What if you tried the other foot? You need to fly to get to the East Coast... Are you paying for me? My dream is easier to achieve. Soon, whenever you turn on the TV or go online, you'll see me singing. Why are you walking like that? Like a diver? Try bending your knees. Listen... Bring me your script. - Look at your script. - What? - Look at your script. - I know. - What do you know? - I'm in every scene. - No. - What do you mean? It's all blank. Please let's not talk about the bad things. Nick told me off all the time. I've got something to show you. I've still got all of this. I kept everything. This is the script. I was told off for not doing my prep. I hadn't made any notes on my script. After that, I started doing more work. After Nick told me off, I started making lots of notes. I need to clarify it for myself. Looking back now on the past, At the girl I used to be, Self-indulgent, living fast. I hoped one day I would be free, Of all the pain within me, A futile search for gaiety. I longed to take flight, Free to soar wherever I wished, Underneath the starlight. I yearned to break free, To find a better place to be... This song is about how much Kim regrets not having a good relationship with her mother. I actually get on really well with my family. She's taller than me! How would we describe our relationship? We're more like friends. If we can't get to sleep at night, I'll either go to her bed or she'll come and chat with me. I remember taking her to one of my rehearsals. If you get hurt, how will I know? Wherever you go, things will be uncertain. When you go home, help your sister practice by singing with her. You can play the mom, and she'll play her part. Daughter. Mom. OK? OK. Let's go. Actually, when she was younger, I didn't like her much. When I was really young... Because I had a really bad temper. Yeah, she had a really bad temper. I'm seven years older than my sister. Back then I'd just started middle school, so I was an adolescent. You know adolescents go through difficult stages. I was terrible. She made me mad, so I shouted at her. Even my family said that The Awakening had a big effect on me. I really did have a bad temper. I was the kind of person who got angry easily. But after I did The Awakening, this is according to my grandma... She asked me if I felt I'd become calmer, or a bit more restrained, after I'd done the musical. I wasn't as grumpy as before. I want to thank my parents, Nick, Ms. Chung, Ms. Nai Man, Joey, Ken, Mimi and Liz! So many people. Also Ada and Principal Leung. And to everyone who worked on The Awakening. It's all about responsibility. The main thing I learnt was to take responsibility for myself. I learnt to think about the future. What do I want to do? What path do I want to take? When I signed up for The Awakening, I'd actually just graduated from secondary school. I wasn't thinking of staying on at school. But after working for a few months, I realized that wasn't a good idea. I wasn't qualified to do anything, so I thought I might as well go back and study. I went back to take my higher diploma. Now I've got a stable job working in make-up. Six years ago, I remember claiming I'd never dated before. To be clear, that was true. I've been with my boyfriend for about two and a half years now. This is me, and that's my boyfriend. Don't film him to protect him. We should keep him off camera. My hopes and ambitions? Will it be bad if he finds out I've said this? Whatever, I don't care. These are my plans... By 28, we'll have saved enough money to buy a place and get married. Two years after that, I'll have my first baby. Then at 32, I'll have my second. Ideally, I'll have one boy and one girl, a boy first. I'd like a son first. So, in ten years, I'll be looking after my two babies. I'm 24 this year. In ten years, I'll be 34. By then, my second will already be two years old. Sio Fan, look this way. I'm shooting a video... a selfie video. What is it for? Nothing. It's just for fun. OK. Let's go over there. When did you two go to the US? Was it 2014 or 2015? It was 2015. I took my HKDSE exams in 2016. I took my exams in 2015. I flew to the US the day after my results came out. I left one day before you. Sio Fan and Coby's US educational trip What I remember the most was that ferry trip to the Statue of Liberty. Suddenly it started raining. We were taking photos up on deck. We had to take cover really quickly. - It was really windy. - Yes. Everyone who was killed in the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center has their name carved on the memorial. I visited four universities during my visit to the US. I loved the library of Harvard, which was built underground with 50 miles of bookshelves. In MIT, I learnt something new, which is: integration, inspiration, insights and innovation. Those four words are the reminder [of] my learning attitude. I can't forget that time we went to a musical. It was so great. The scene changes and the props were amazing. The actors took us up on stage. Standing there gave me goosebumps. You could really feel how big the place was. Totally. I told my classmates about it. They may have seen shows on Broadway, but none of them have ever set foot on a Broadway stage. Adjust your breath when you start singing. Breathe deeply. Just like you're opening a door, really smoothly. Just concentrate on this one thing. Yes. That's right. Yes. That's exactly right. This performance is for the school's 40th anniversary. Sio Fan was in the third form during the 35th anniversary. "Lux aeterna" means "eternal light". "Luceate" means "shine on us". It's a song about hope. She's become more mature and independent. She knows her own mind, but she's not an open book. You have to take time getting to know her before she opens up. But actually, she really wants more people to care about her. It started when I was about two. They found cancer cells in the retina of one eye. Then, after a fever, the cancer spread to the other eye. So I lost vision in both of my eyes. You can get in first. My mom says I'm wasting my time doing this. Will she come to the show? She says she doesn't want to waste her money. What if I buy her tickets? Please don't. That would really stir up a storm for me when I get home. Why? Her mom would think she's been talking behind her back. She's really... She's just against me taking part in anything other than school work. At home, I don't laugh much or do anything like dancing. So she's never seen this side of me before. Would you be happy if your mom came tomorrow? Yes, but it would also make me feel nervous and awkward. Thinking back to that night, the walls crashed and crumbled. I woke from my slumber, trapped in the rubble. Let go of your doubts, Happiness cannot fear the storm. Once the storm has passed, I will treasure your love even more. I'm really moved. Don't cry. She was really great. She got all her stage positions just right. All the hand movements too. Say a few words of encouragement. What did you think of Sio Fan's performance? Was it pretty good? She did well. She wasn't perfect, she didn't do all the moves right. But it was fine. Pretty good. What I saw... When you make it in the end, and other people recognize that... At first, some things might seem impossible, but then you can succeed in the end. I remember when I got to university, and I told people I was studying linguistics, they'd ask me why. Why not study what other visually-impaired students study? At least that would make it easier to find a job afterwards. But sometimes you need to be the first to walk a path. In the end, you'll prove you can succeed. It's wrong to think we only have one or two career options. I'm majoring in linguistics. I'd like to go on and study a master's in speech therapy. At first, everyone said I should study translation, so that's where I started. Then I met Wing when she volunteered to be my mentor. This is the XP. And here, this is the YP, OK? - Can you feel that? - Yeah. And that derives from the head and the complement. Most students get through a page of study material quickly. For me, one table might take up several pages. I have to flip through a lot of pages just to find one symbol. I actually didn't know how she did this. This is my first time seeing the entire set of complete material. It's amazing. A good linguist must be good in knowing how to analyze a given data set. She has very good analytical skills. And I also believe that's one of the reasons why she transferred from translation to linguistics, because the analytical skill is more important for linguistics students. Actually I enjoy the demands of college, because I am studying something that I like. No matter how hard it is, I will stick to it. In high school, I wasn't very social. In college, although they (fellow students) know I need help and they're very attentive when they're taking me around, they don't treat me like I'm any different. So we have a lot of fun together, and when we're studying, we have really engaging discussions. Good morning. Ah, you scared me! That's what I was trying to do. There's a ditch... - Just ignore it? - Yeah, ignore it. If you hit something to your right, then go left a little. If you hit something on your left, go right a little. That way you stay on track. Has it been a while since you've used your stick? No, I've been using it. Are you using it less than before? A little bit. - Am I doing OK? - Yes, you're fine. Tsz Nok... Can you be a bit more serious, please. Can you show me how? How can I do that? I'm just asking you some questions. Tsz Nok, I want to ask you, in the five years since My Voice, My Life, what have been the biggest changes in your life? I've taken part in a lot of activities since then, especially this past year since leaving high school. I've met more people and I'm forcing myself to talk more to others. I think I'm less shy than I used to be. All I want to do is sing, As my voice rings out, my worries disappear. To the distant horizon, As we fly through the sky, the sun dissolves our fears. I was in two musicals last year. It was stressful sometimes. I spend a long time thinking things over before I do them. Do you think that's a weakness? Do you want to change that? Maybe it's a weakness. But it's also a strength. It means I'm more proactive when I do something. "A" makes me nervous, "B" makes me inspired, Like a firecracker in a poem. Oh, oh, oh... Whenever I accomplish something, I realize that there was no need to be scared. Fear is a waste of time. But then I still get scared the next time. It's like a cycle. You get that scared? Back then, I was at a regular high school. Because I'm kind of an introvert, or rather, it takes me a while to open up. I don't say much at first. People jump to the conclusion that it's because I lost my sight when I was a teenager. But that's not true. Even if I got my sight back, I wouldn't necessarily start talking to everyone. There are a few different ways you can get my illness, but there aren't many cases in Hong Kong. Basically, my sight loss will stay the same. It won't get any worse. My parents still feel sad. They say it would be different if I'd been born blind. They would have accepted it a long time ago. I could still see when I was a teenager. It was very hard for my parents to suddenly have to accept that their son had lost his sight. Life is everything. If you lose your life, then that's it. I also said that in the film. I've said it before, and I still believe it now. And lastly, I want to say to my mom... I think she's sitting over there... I'm here! Mom, my loss of sight is a fact we must face. I want to thank you for still loving me, for not giving up hope and wishing for a miracle every day. We'd all welcome a miracle, but if it never happens, I hope you can stop feeling sad. All I've lost is my sight. I still have my life. With life, you can do anything. I won't give up because of my blindness. Mom, I know you cry easily. But I want you to know I'm alright. The most important thing is that he's happy. His mother wants him to be well. We've argued about this many times. We have different opinions. I've accepted it, but that doesn't mean I should expect her to accept it too. And if she can't accept it, that doesn't mean I have to feel the same. She needs more time. She's already come round a lot. Happy birthday to you... Look at the camera. I think she (my mom) will be able to accept it. Before she would avoid some sensitive words and subjects. But, now she has come around some, a bit more realistic. When I got into The Chinese University of Hong Kong, they were so happy. My mom, my family, and my friends were really pleased when they heard the news. It's the university I've always wanted to go to. I chose the subject I wanted to study: social sciences. I've recently chosen to major in politics and administration. I'm interested in current affairs and I want to understand people and their behavior. So that's why I chose this major. Are you the first student at your university to have a guide dog? Yes, I think I'm the first. She (Pepper) comes with me to three hours of lectures. You've been together for a while now. How have you or your life changed thanks to your dog? I can go places by myself now. I feel a lot safer. My family are also less worried about me going out. It's easier to socialize too. Thank you all for your continued support for the visually impaired and for helping us lead lives of dignity. Generally speaking, the thing she helps me with the most is avoiding obstacles. She (Pepper) acts as my eyes. Even things above her eyeline, if she stays focused, I won't even know anything's there. If things goes smoothly, she steers me clear of all obstacles. Using a stick, I have to hit something to know where I am. Now I can even go around corners smoothly. She's like a child or a baby. I have to guess what she's thinking. If she won't move, I have to work out if I need to coax her or if someone next to us is playing with her. When we're out, I always have to guess what she's thinking. I'm not that good at getting on with other people. You know that? Of course I know that. I know myself. That's great. Yeah, that's how it is. You need to open up and let your true feelings out. Do you mean now? No, I mean with your guide dog. I do let my true feelings out. If I shout at her, other people tell me not to be so fierce. But I don't know how to coax her. We're still getting used to each other. I don't know yet if this is my first love. I've never been in love before, so I don't really know. It feels like I'm caring for a child. A daughter. Yes, like a daughter, because she's a girl. When it rains, I worry about her getting wet. I should bring a towel, but I often forget. Then other people remind me to rub her down with a towel next time or she'll get sick. I get wet too. It's embarrassing, but that's the way it is. Ready! One, two... Let's take another one. One... I've been a Christian for a few years now. But I haven't studied much apart from at church. I've always wanted to meet other Christians and exchange ideas. We have another wonderful day expected, and I thank you for coming to Israel and allowing me to be a part of this lovely tour. Right now we're gonna be making our way to an archaeological site, an old city called Caesarea. One, two, three. One, two, three. - Do I need to switch place? - Sure. We'll journey deep into the Bible tomorrow. It won't be an easy trek. So, why are we going to make you all sweat? Because we want you to feel what it was like for Jesus traveling to all those different towns and villages. We especially want to encourage Curtis, who will join us on this journey. We were following the "footsteps of Jesus" in the wilderness. There are some plants along here that will stick to your clothes. As we walked, I thought about how we were all wearing sneakers. What kind of shoes did they have on back then? I thought about these kinds of things. It was really sunny. It was all open, there was no shade. It was also really dry. That's what was so challenging. The guide told me not to do it. He said even sighted people found it exhausting and difficult. The college chaplain asked me how I felt. Did I feel confident? I said not at all, because I'm not a sporty person. But then he asked if I wanted to try and I said yes. He said OK, that he respected my choice and he'd ask the guide to let me try. The water's above ankle level. If you're not afraid of getting wet and you walk beside the rocks, you can help Curtis across, that should work. He needs to feel the rocks. Don't let the stick go into the water. Use your right foot. The stick is for gauging distance, don't let it get in the water. Use your left foot. Step forward. OK. Normally, I would have told them not to worry. But by that point I'd have messed things up if I'd tried to do it myself. So I accepted their help and carried on walking. Curtis completed more than ten kilometers of the Jesus Trail. I did not believe that Curtis can do this. I was given a lot of trouble and I called up my insurance agent and I said this is madness. This can't be. He cannot do it. It's impossible for a blind man to do this. I was requesting all kinds of letters of insurance, but I must say, Curtis, I am surprised. Looking back, it's already been four or five months now. During the trip, apart from the special tours and the study sessions, the food was also a new experience for you. My observation is that you don't actually think about what you're eating or take time to savor it. I just care about feeling full. You take a practical approach, as if eating was a task to fulfill. And then you move on to the next thing. Do think you're that kind of person? I think that I'm like that about a lot of things, not just about eating. Maybe that's why I don't have much to say right now. Right. So that's how you live your life, one task after another. Yes, fulfilling tasks. You finish one thing, then move onto the next. Something like that. I also feel insecure, uncertain. You have to do something yourself in order to know you've done it. If you can imagine it, then you can keep on thinking about it. If you can't, you can come back to it later on. I think that's just the way you are. You can really see it in the way you eat. That's why I asked you about food. Life isn't just about completing tasks, it's also important to feel and experience life for yourself. I think you're doing really well over the past six months. You've gone from being nervous about speaking to others, constantly worried that you're stammering... Actually you don't. You speak fluently. Life is an exploration, a series of different experiences. You should step back and reflect on what's happened. It'll help prepare you for the future. Please give him the spotlight. Feel the space. Count to 30, then play the music. We all have our own dreams. We live to chase those dreams. But when those around us don't believe in us, we lose confidence. We try just once and fail. Then we're too afraid to try again. Are you willing to keep chasing your dreams? In 2013, Nick quit his teaching job to focus on "Character & Arts" education through musicals. After producing three musicals with high-school students, he returned to teach at the Pui Ching Middle School, where he is now the principal. 2013? The Awakening and those few years actually had a huge impact on me. To a certain degree, before 2013, I was really... I was very pragmatic. I was an exam-focused teacher. It was simple. I wanted to help them get into university. That was my only goal. I was very utilitarian. But those three years made me... You rarely get a chance to help blind students from Ebenezer School. You spot them from a distance and rush over to guide them across a road. It's about nurturing them. Like Ah Bok, Fat Yin, Jessica... They all have their stories. Also Wing Wing. If it wasn't for those three years, if I hadn't worked with them, I wouldn't have the understanding of my students that I have today. OK. Class is over. Thank you everyone. Remember to thank your teachers. Thank you! If that group of teenagers hadn't worke on The Awakening all that summer, who knows where they'd be today. At the very least, I believe they felt love that summer, they felt part of a family, and they felt supported. After the theatrical release of My Voice, My Life in October 2014, a guidance and mentoring program was set up for the students who were featured in the film. The program provided tutoring and financial assistance for their studies, as well as funding for educational trips to the US. Educational Trips Tutoring Programs The program also provided support for visually-impaired students at Ebenezer School. Living with dignity means being able to decide things for myself. You have to be alive, of course, before you can decide on your own path in life. I don't need to worry what other people think. I think I'm already able to be myself, to live with dignity. I want to be a social worker because you don't have to beat around the bush. You don't have to try to please everyone. I need to get better at speaking to people, but I don't want to say things that I don't think are true. So this is the kind of job I like. My parents have never said they wanted me to become rich, earn loads of money, become a doctor or a lawyer... be famous. They just want me to be happy and to be an honest and truthful person. When I was younger, I would disrespect my mom sometimes. I was the first to start an argument. Growing up, I've learnt how to respect her. I understand why she sometimes stopped me doing things. But I still stick to what I believe in. A friend said to me, "I know someone who wants to meet Tsz Nok, because he's very handsome". I want to ask, how come you're so good at studying? You're really good. Actually, I'm not that good. You... How's it going with your other half? - My girlfriend? - Yes. Yes, we're OK. Can you tell us a bit about her? I didn't really want to talk about this. You have to. We've been together for more than two years now. It's going pretty well. What do you want to know? Whatever you want to share. Nothing. There's nothing I want to share. We've been together more than two years. We haven't thought about getting married yet. We have talked about having kids, but only brainstorming.
