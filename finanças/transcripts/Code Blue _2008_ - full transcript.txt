Previously on Code Blue. Are you thinking you can meet him? You ran away! Her suicide... was my fault? You were in pain, weren't you? Visiting Mom's grave every year, you prayed while carrying that burden on your shoulders. From now on, let me carry half of that burden. It's stage 4 of lung cancer. In my own way, I'm trying to be a doctor till the end. Sorry. I wasn't aware of the illness of the person most dear to me. It's not like it's all bad now. I have a family, and a daughter who really cares for me. Even if it's one more day... live long! I'll show you I can do it properly. - But you could have gotten her consent. Why didn't you... - The DNR order...! ...is a document that says, "I'm letting Tsubasa-kun die!" Naomi-san had already declared her intention. Nonetheless, are you telling me to make her sign that document?! I... ...have become scared of patients. We'll perform a circulatory arrest and stop the heart temporarily. We'll put him in a death status. With a body temperature of 20 degrees, we can simulate death for 20 minutes. {\a6}(Tadokoro Yoshiaki - Lifesaving chief) Blocking the blood flow during the operation might be difficult, so we'll make preparations to perform a circulatory arrest. Medical practice {\a6}Therefore we'll need the help of the Anesthesia Dpt. is a succession of choices. {\a6}Getting the heart back from its arrest status Go into surgery whilst prepared for hemorrhaging, {\a6}will be taken care of by Dr. Machida's team. or persist with the more conservative therapy. {\a6}Looking forward to working with you. {\a6}The entire operation will be managed by Prof. Yamazaki from the Anesthesia Dpt. {\a6}We can stop oral ingestion for Tachikawa-san in 3A. In any case, at that fork in the road, {\a6}Kimura-san in 3B... once you choose, you can't turn back. {\a6}Yesterday it was 37.5 degrees. You can't reset. {\a6}This morning he's stable at 37 degrees. {\a6}Okay. {\a6}We're done. That is... the same with life. Chief's operation is this afternoon. In order for Chief to come back with peace of mind, work hard and heal more patients today, too. Yes. It's a succession of uncertain forks in the road. But... {\a6}(Fellowship closing certification) ...there's no option but to choose and proceed down one road. The crossroad in one's life draws near mercilessly. {\a6}(Fellowship closing certification, March 25th) So, just close the stomach and we're done. Yes. Tie it up already. You're so slow, like always. The patient is suffering, you know. An unconscious patient. You're so full of vitality, aren't you. When will you stop whining? You're so not cute when you whine. Get a 2-0 thread next. I almost got sued. Do you understand how I feel? Angled needle, please. I don't. You almost got sued, right? They stopped right before. Don't get cold feet. Get a big needle. Hurry. I'm firm. What? Did you confess to Saejima? You like her, don't you? Idiot! - Y-You... What are you talking about? - Don't get cold feet. - Hurry up with that needle and thread! - Yes. But, by stopping the heart, will the brain be okay? Apparently, it's okay for 20 minutes as long as the body temperature is lowered. The operation will be performed by the most competent doctors of Shohoku. In that case, I'm relieved. But, sure he's an excellent brain surgeon, but it seems he's never performed such an operation before. Tada. I bought a good-luck charm. Oh, I thought that just one wouldn't be effective enough. From here and there, see. See, here's one. Wait a minute. There! Could you give all these to him? This... On the contrary, doesn't this bring bad karma? You look pale. Your chest hurts? Hey, hey. Are you okay? Takashi-chan. Takashi-chan. Just a little longer. Hang in there. Isn't it over yet?! Takashi-chan. {\a6}(Accidental tobacco ingestion while the mother was smoking... Thinks there's juice...) {\a6}(Gastric lavage) Okay. You're fine now. Good boy. There you go. Slowly. - Next take X-rays and book for a second visit tomorrow. - Okay. Aah, what a relief, Takashi-chan! But don't put everything in your mouth. But, Doctor, you're really amazing. Lifesaving isn't a place to clean up after careless parents. I'm sorry. An ambulance is arriving in two minutes. Take care of the rest. Okay. Unconscious? Fell from the 4th floor. Do you think you can meet today? We arranged for a tentative lunch at 12, but... Can you change shifts with me on the 24th? The 24th? Sure. Is something the matter? It's my mother's death anniversary. You're visiting her grave? Yeah. It's a tradition since I was 8. I was taken by my grandmother, and went there for over 20 years without understanding the situation. I see. I want to do a proper visit this year. It's here. Kono Takefumi-san, 45 years old. Fell off the handrail on the 4th floor. In shock due to hemorrhaging. Pulse in the carotid artery is weak. We're close to cardiac arrest. Let's hurry! I never thought you'd collapse before me. Only this time was I ahead of you. When we were students, I was never a match to you, no matter what I did. What are you talking about? What's the use of getting ahead of him over such a matter. He's really unbelievable. So, how is it going with Dr. Shiraishi? Oh. Well, since I'm here, I thought we could have lunch together. Oh. At what time? Right. At noon. What? Noon? But it's already one. - It's impossible now. - It's fine, it's fine. I put off my flight. Yes, it's fine. You're going to Aomori right after this? Yes. You're working so hard. You should be moderate, even with lectures. How's your physical condition? The anti-cancer drug is effective, so I'm fine. I see. But you've got such a beautiful and lovely daughter. She's got a prominent potential for lifesaving. She's become strong. She's too good to be true. Next, if I can just see my grandchild's face, I can die at any time. Excuse me. It's one hour before entering the OR. Okay. Please. Sure. Let's talk again, after the operation. Yeah. I'll wait after all. Oh, no. I'm talking to myself. Excuse me. Oh, I'm sorry. A faint heart is of no use. Beat it! It's okay. She'll come, for sure. It's pulmonary embolism, no doubt about it. Hurry up and get the PCPS, please. We've already asked for one. We can go to the catheterization room in three minutes. The right kidney isn't clearly visible. There's liquid accumulation in the abdominal cavity. There's no time to take him to the OR. Let's do it here. - Alright. - Okay. Retroperitoneal hemorrhage, huh. Somebody help here, please! I'll come. - I'll take it out once. - Okay. Are you okay over there? We'll manage. - The catheterization room is free. - Good, let's go. Take care of the rest. - Yes. - Yes. {\a6}Posting our subtitles on streaming media is strictly prohibited! Translator: suketeru Spot translator & Editor: seri Timer: Dai-Chan Special thanks to qop123 The inferior vena cava is torn. Is it hard to do a side clamp? I'll try to open up a little more. It's no use. The bleeding is too profuse, I can't see. Hold that side down. Roll up some gauze and hold it with forceps. Make two. - What? - Hurry. Yes. A sponge stick? With this thick a vein, that could work. Blood flow decreased. I can see it. Let's hurry with the stitching. 3000 proline. Yes. I've stopped the bleeding of the femoral artery. Perhaps it comes with age. I've come to do both management and examination enthusiastically. Having work has been of great help for me. Is that so? Lifesaving is as busy as ever. Yes. Dr. Tachibana is doing a splendid job at it. Even without me there, everything still runs like clockwork. I'm happy about it, but it also makes me feel a little lonely. Just now the Fellowship members were operating on a multiple trauma. Really? They've completely got a doctor's expression on their faces. Yeah. On the other hand, that probably means I've aged. Yes? Excuse me. Oh. Ah! You're here! It's been a long time. Yeah. Seems you're doing good. Yes. Then, I'll leave now. Really? Since I'm here, I thought I'd pay a visit to the other department doctors. I'll pray for the operation to go well. Thank you. Dr. Kuroda. Yes? If need be, please take care of me. Dr. Tachibana. Yes? How's Dr. Hiyama doing? Oh. Her hand healed, but she's still not... I see. Yes. Well... Oh! Instead of Dr. Kuroda, Dr. Tachibana is here. Excuse me for disturbing. So, how is it going? - What? - With Dr. Mitsui. Will you be getting back together? No, I... You should express your feelings already. You never know when a person will collapse, just like him. To hear that from my wife, it's going to be hard to die. Recovered blood pressure. Base excess improved to -5. Good. Let's take him to the OR. The Anesthesia Department is waiting. Thank you. Kuroda! I'll be waiting, like always, for you to come back. Go ahead, please. Yes. You've become so neat and tidy. Is this what happens away from location? Yeah. Are you jealous? A little. What's your opinion on the operation? It's quite tough. Be steadfast. Don't kill Chief. Just as usual. I'm sorry. There was a vascular injury and I have to go into the OR now. I see. Well, that's how it is with appointments between doctors. You'll come again when Chief's operation is over, right? When that time comes, let's do lunch, Dad. Yeah. Well then. Don't overwork yourself, Megumi. Yeah. Bye. - Preparations for the oxygenator are in order. - Okay. Let's hope we won't have to use it. - Drill. - Yes. C1 shaving is coming to an end. Protect the vertebral artery. Here. What should we do with the hemorrhage here? It's from the sinus gland, right? Don't worry about it. - I'm opening the dura mater. Scalpel number 11. - Here. Yes? It's been a while. Aah. Kosaku. How are you? I'm doing quite well. You? Busy, as always. I see. As always. Yeah. You're so strong. Really... strong. I wonder who you resemble in that. But, don't overwork yourself. You too, Grandma. Don't strain yourself. On the 24th... I'll come over. Are you sure? I promised, didn't I? Thank you. Say, Grandma. What is it? Did he ever go? To visit the grave. Well... I don't know. I see. Alright. Bye. How's your arm? It's difficult for it to become normal after that amputation. Two neural implants and two hours of daily rehabilitation. After 1.5 years, it's in this condition. I can't hold a scalpel anymore. I was told by Saijo earlier, that I've become all neat and tidy. There are no calls in the dead of night, and I get up at 6 in the morning and go to bed at 10 everyday. An ordinary life, isn't it. Exactly. Run firmly. The amount of time you can run at top speed is unexpectedly short. Once you look back, that is. Your son, how is he? Kobe. LeBron. Nowitzki. Kidd. Those are names of players in the NBA. I bought several books. Buying books besides medical ones isn't so bad. This is Midorikawa Fire Department. A plane fell about 3Km northeast of Narita Airport. A plane... fell? Yes. We still don't have details on the situation, but we're receiving reports that it's a passenger plane. Wait a minute! Did it crash? We don't know. But it seems there are many injured. Requesting Doctor Heli. Alright. We're moving out. What sort of accident is it?! - How many injured people are we talking about? - I don't know. Let's hope it's no more than a private plane. I'll be right there. Excuse me. - Take care of this. - Okay. Yes. Got it. Please inform us when you have more information. It's a domestic line. Domestic line? A domestic flight from Haneda turned around due to engine trouble, and tried to land in Narita, it seems. It then made an emergency landing in a nearby vacant field and burst into flames. Do we know the flight number? Flight JEA21. A 50-passenger air commuter. From Haneda to Aomori. Is something the matter? It's the flight my father is on. What?! Meaning in the mountain forest of Numatachou in Narita city? Let's see... Oh. There's an elementary school nearby. There's an open field about 200m southwest. You might be able to land there. Oh, but isn't there any other landmark around there? It's in the forest, so there isn't anything that constitutes a landmark. Oh. Smoke is rising into the sky, so please use that as a landmark. Alright. Is that it? It's still burning. This?! This is Shohoku Doctor Heli. We found the plane that crashed, but we can't locate the landing point. Is there anyone who can guide us? Oh... Go northwest from the smoking point. There it is! They're waving. It's over there. We located the point. We'll be landing now. There are many injured. Got it. We'll transport doctors there on touch-and-go. Aizawa, Hiyama! Get ready! Yes! Yes. Please let me go, too. If you can't concentrate because you're anxious, don't go. They're expecting doctors there. I know. I'll go as a doctor. Hand this over to the Blood Transfusion Dpt. Come with the next helicopter. Yes. This way. Please. This way. Midorikawa Fire Dpt. Over there? Wait, please. Let me explain. It fell over there, but... - Oh, can I do it while we run there? - Yes. We don't know when the jet fuel will catch fire, so we can't get close. We're taking the injured to that school's gym. A gym. 50 passengers! - Yes. - Yes. The helicopter will arrive in one minute! - Yes. - Yes! Please make way! This way. Dr. Mitsui. I'll do the triage. It's okay to leave treatment to the doctors coming later, right? Yes. - I'll start from the right. - Okay. I'm Fujikawa from Shohoku Lifesaving Center. Do you understand me? Do you understand? Just as I thought. The aneurysm is in the way, so we can't block the vertebral artery. Let's go ahead. Scalpel number 15. Yes. - Dissector. - Yes. No use. I can't control the bleeding. - Bipolar. - Yes. Bleeding amount, 750. Blood pressure, 80. We have no choice. We'll have to switch to circulatory arrest after all. Dr. Machida, please. - Heparin, please. - Yes. Here. Okay. Run the oxygenator. Yes. We have a total flow. Decreasing body temperature. The pump will be stopped at 20 degrees. Replace the aspirator with pump suction. Yes. Hemorrhage increasing. It's because we added the heparin and decreased the temperature. Absorb steadily and then bring him back with the oxygenator. Arresting the heart. Excuse me. Is Dr. Tachibana here? Dr. Tachibana? The hemorrhage in Dr. Tadokoro's operation has increased. We wanted to inform him of the situation. Arresting circulation. Flow down. The hemorrhaging stopped. Continuing with thrombus removal. - Call out every five minutes, please. - Okay. Micro-scissors. Yes. They said we were going back because of some trouble. They said we'd stop temporarily at Narita Airport. But then, they made another announcement. I'm not too sure, but they said we were going to do a crash landing. And then, the plane started shaking. Doctor, my leg hurts. - Please, examine it. - Please. Doctor, please. Lower him, please. 1, 2, 3! Do you know where you are? Please. Does it hurt somewhere? Doctor. My legs. Are my legs... okay? They're fine. How is it? Fujikawa and I are doing the triage now. I see. You two, start examining the red-tagged patients with Fujikawa. Okay. Okay. Please! Doctor. What should we do with this patient? Put him on the left side of that basket goal. Red tags on the left, yellow ones in the middle. Black tags in the back, over there. Is that okay, Dr. Tachibana? I leave it to you. Divide that table and put the medicine on top. Put all the monitors and oxygen cylinders on the left, as well as transfusion blood. - Okay. - Okay. Police officers. - Please take care of hospital communications and arrangement of location info. - Okay. - Someone who knows the current situation? - Yes. Fill me in, please. This way. Dr. Shiraishi, here please. Yes. {\a6}(Temporary spot for corpses) Follow up on Dr. Mitsui. Are you okay? Doctor, please. - Forearm pulse is weak. Get a line. - Yes. Sir, can you hear me? What's the status? Breathing difficulty due to smoke inhalation. But he has settled down considerably. Administer oxygen. Yes. Mori-san, the doctor is here. You'll be fine now. Can you take a deep breath? Dr. Fujikawa! Oh, you. From the train accident. I'm Hosoi. Thank you for all your trouble on that occasion. Measuring SpO2. Breathing is not a problem anymore. I'm changing it to a yellow tag. Yes. Thanks to you, I'm still doing this. You're quite prompt. There aren't enough people for transportation, so I'll go back. I see. Be careful. Yes. You too. Do you know him? Yes. We saved a patient together. I'll be right back. I'll take over. - Fixate and ventilate. - Yes. Concentrate. 15 minutes left. It's adhered quite well to the vascular wall. - Bring all of it here. - Replace the IV. Yes. Please. Burn injuries. Do you understand? Can you tell me your name? I'm Miyamoto. There was someone with me. My wife. Shin-chan! He has a large burn. Don't touch him. Shin-chan. Shin-chan. Shin-chan. Shin-chan. It will hurt a little, but please bear with it. This is a form to write his traits and belongings. {\a6}(Survivor's ID information) {\a6}(Physical traits) Fill it in and hand it over to the police or firemen. Refresh your mind. Under 10 minutes remaining. The vascular wall is quite stretched. A hole, this big. Yeah. 8-0 suture. Mending. Yes. Take care of the rest. Excuse me. Where does it hurt? Here? I'll check it out. Ma'am. May I talk to you for a minute? Please do something, quick. Miyamoto-san has 3rd-degree burns on 80% of his body. It has burned to his respiratory tract. So? He's in an extremely dangerous condition. But isn't it all normal? He said there's no pain. That's because it's a deep burn. The blood vessels are destroyed, and blood flow is blocked. However, in order to do a tracheal intubation to ensure respiration we need to insert a tube into his throat. But, in 10 minutes his throat will rapidly swell up and we won't be able to insert the tube. In that case, do it quick. If we intubate him, it can't be removed. He won't be able to talk. No... After treatment is over, however... There's a high probability he'll die anyway. It's unfortunate. You're kidding, right? Then... In short, we can leave him like this and you can talk to him a little longer, or intubate him and take a bet on medical treatment. No... What do you want to do? What do I want to do?! What are the chances that he'll be cured? Frankly, they're slim. Tae. Tae. Shin-chan. You are soaked with blood. Hurry, get someone to cure you. Doctor. Doctor! Please take care of her first. I'm okay. Please. Dr. Hiyama, we need to hurry. Doctor! Hiyama! I'll take over. 7.5 tube. Yes! Excuse me. Miyamoto-san, do you understand? I'll insert a tube now to make breathing easier. Your wife is fine. I'm glad. I'll intubate. Shin-chan! - Tube. - Here. - Give him a transportation order. - Yes. In this situation there's no way the family can make a decision. It's our job to make the decisions here. Don't drag it along forever. Nogami Tsubasa won't come back, and the lawsuit was dropped. Do what you can now. I might make another mistake. What you did was not wrong. It's just that the outcome was bad. Don't run away, Hiyama! Five minutes left. Do you think you can do it, Dr. Saijo? Dr. Saijo! Can I do it?! His head is open and his heart has stopped. We can't backtrack. We have no choice but to do it. Doctor! Doctor, Shin-chan has... - Take care of the rest. - Yes. - Shin-chan! - Yes. Let me put an end to it. Yes. I'm sorry. 3:13. - Are you okay?! - You'll be fine. - Jun! We're here! - Please. - Stretcher going out. - Doctor, please. Hosoi-kun? Doctor. Doctor! I want you to examine someone. He's been suffering all this time. Can you lie down? I'll examine your body. Shota. A doctor is here. A doctor. That's good. You'll be fine. You haven't handed it in yet? 180cm. Birthmark on his shoulder. Has ingrown toenails. These three things are all I know of my dad. I know nothing else. I don't know anything about my own father. You know three things. To the red area. Yes. The plane has been extinguished. You have permission to approach it. Is that so. Take care of things here. Okay. Aizawa, Shiraishi, Saejima! We're going on location. We have permission to go in, but triage is still being performed near the location. Over there? Yes. You have the same expression, huh. What? As when you first came to Shohoku. Weak and pathetic. What did Dr. Kuroda teach you? You're a doctor. Save people. Do you understand? Please transport this person first. Okay. Please. Okay, 1, 2, 3! Dad! Megumi. You're wounded! Why didn't you go to the gym?! I'm sorry. But, I... ...am a doctor after all. I'm Aizawa from the Lifesaving Center. You have cuts on your head and arm. Calm down, please. What's wrong? My son. I left my son behind. I-In there! I abandoned my son. Hurry up! Saijo! Keep fansubbing alive by NOT putting this for sale or rent!
