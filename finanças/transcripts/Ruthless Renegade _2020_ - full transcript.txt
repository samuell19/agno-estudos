(horn blaring) (dramatic dance music) (crowd cheering) (crickets chirping) (dog barking) (pensive music) (shots firing) - [Audrey] oh! We gotta go, we gotta go! - Don't do this, Audrey, go! - Mom, wait! (shot firing) (screams) mom! No! No! (Audrey screams) (shot firing) (Audrey gasping) (dramatic music) (shot firing) (Audrey gasps) (pensive music) (crickets chirping) (footsteps crunching) you've seen this before, right? Insignificant minor character gets murdered in the opening scene? And you're probably thinking, why do they always do that? I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. They do this to make you want to watch the movie. That's why. Let me tell you something else. Newsflash, I am not some minor character. This is my story. So, my name is Audrey Anderson and while it appears that things may not be looking too bright for me, trust me, it hasn't always been this way. At one point, everything was just peachy. Let me take you back to the beginning. This whole thing started about four months ago, mainly because I was running way late. Oh my god! - Whoa! - I'm so sorry, are you okay? - I'm okay, are you? - I'm way late. Do you know where the renegade workout facility is? - Yeah, it's over that way. Are you dancing tryouts? - Right, thank you. - Something about girl's night. (dancers chattering) (upbeat music) - oh my god, he's so cute. - Have you been waiting in line long? - Me? Maybe about 10 minutes. Everybody else, maybe a hour. - Oh, good, I thought I was late. - You're definitely late, and don't think coach didn't notice. - [dancer] yo, hakim, how 'bout an autograph, huh? (hakim chuckles) - [dancer] oh, he's really cute. Hi! - Lookin' good, baby. - Yo, she's hot, bro. - I'm Audrey by the way. - Tracy. - First time? - No, unfortunately. It's my second year tryin' out. Swear to god, if I don't make the same this year, I'm gonna kill somebody. (Audrey laughs) (Tracy laughs) - [Cassie] welcome everyone. Please turn in your head shots. Make sure that your contact info is correct and start warming up. For those of you returning, it's great to see you and it's wonderful seeing all these new faces, too. - Excuse me. - Excuse me, the line starts back here. (bailey chuckles) yo, who the hell do you think you are cuttin' in front of us? - Who do I think I am? - [Tracy] yes! - I'm bailey west. I'm already on the team. - You were on the team. (bailey sighs) that was last year. This year you audition like everyone else. - What's the matter, coach? You worried? - About what? - That someday I'll have your job? - Back of the line, bailey. (Cassie exhales) - bye. (girls chattering) (gentle music) - ready for it, okay. All right. Thank you for being here today everyone. Please stand up and get ready to form four lines. We're gonna do across-the-floor combination. (upbeat music) five, six, seven, eight! Step, step, chaines turn, chaines turn. Chasse, yes! Again! Five, six, seven, eight! One, two, three, four, hit!

Good luck. - Nice meeting you. Bye. - Here you go. - [Audrey] really? (Audrey squeals) (Tracy laughs) - [Audrey and Tracy] oh my god, oh my god! - [Audrey] oh my god!

(dancer laughs) - hey, you dropped your jersey. - Oh, wow, thank you. What's your name? - I'm Audrey. It's no problem. - Hi, Audrey. Walter. - [dancer] you're kidding me! - Excuse me, I'm sorry, hi. - Hi. - Walter, can I get a picture with you? - Sure. - Here, let me. - I'm so excited. (dancers laughing) - ready? One, two, three. (shutter clicking) perfect. - Is it cute? - There you go, yeah. - Do I need another one? Okay. - Here, oo! - Very great to meet you. - Oh. - Thank you. - Thank you. - You were great last game. - Thank you. Do you want one? - Oh, that's okay. - Hi. - [hakim] hey, babe. (bailey squeals) - [bailey] oh my gosh! (bailey laughs) - [hakim] you look good. - Excuse me. - [hakim] hey, walter's comin'. (dancer laughs) - why are you doin' that? - Doing what? - You know what. In front of everybody? - Please. - Can we talk for a second, in private? - No, I'm a little busy. Hello? And besides, we're done talking. - Come on. - Don't touch me! - Don't do that. - Get away from me! (pensive music) - we're not done talking. I'll be out in my car. (pensive music) (dancers chattering) - [cassie] and we're back. Give us your personalities, ladies. - Hi, I'm cynthia. - I'm tatiana. - My name's victoria. - My name is maria. - I'm patrice. - I'm gigi. I'm from miami, florida. - Dallas, texas. - San francisco. - Here in los angeles. - Alaska. - Kansas city, kansas, not missouri. - Hi, I'm tracy. I'm originally from utah. I became really passionate about acting, such an original concept for this town. I've always been a renegades fan. Pick me (chuckles). - Bailey here, raised in seattle. I was a renegade girl last season and it was the most incredible year of my life. And I can say from experience that cassie is hands down the best dance coach I've ever had, and I hope I get the chance to work with her again. - Hi, I'm audrey anderson. I am from the valley. Well, van nuys, california. Hey (chuckles). I just love dancing and I swear I've always wanted to be a renegades girl. Well, I guess I shouldn't swear, even though I really didn't. Um, uh... Look, I just, I love performing and pouring my heart and soul into dancing and I really want this and I promise you I will work my butt off. Go renegades! Yay. Bye guys. - Hey, audrey. It was great meeting you. You're such an awesome dancer. - Thanks, you too. Except for I think I totally blew it at the end. - Oh, come on, don't worry about it. Look, it's just presentation, okay? You're still in the runnin', so don't start to get down on yourself. - Thanks. Do you wanna exchange numbers or something? - Yeah, come on. Yeah, we can go work out sometime. Plus I know this really dope dance class in the valley that I know you would kill. - I would love that. Here. - All right. Catch you later. - Bye. - [tracy] bye. - You're such a loser! You're such a loser! And for the last time you don't tell me who I can date! We're done. You're such a loser. (pensive music) - how'd it go? - God, I don't know. Good, bad, somewhere in between. They said they would call us within a week or so and let us know if we made it or not. - Well, I hope they call you. Audrey, right? - Yeah. Your name is? - Walter. - Right (laughs). You know, you seem really familiar, like I've seen your face before but I just can't place it. (audrey laughs) (walter chuckles) how'd it go with bailey? - You saw that. She's complicated. Who are you waiting for? - A ride share driver. Although I don't know if he's coming anymore because my phone just died, so. - Well, if your phone died then he can't find you. Where do you live? - The valley. - I'm goin' that way. Hop in, I'll give you a ride. - Oh, no, I can't. Thanks, though. (gentle music) so, how long did you two date? - About six months. She broke up with me right in the middle of playoffs. Said she didn't like me being on the road all the time and then she goes and dates a team member? - That had to hurt. - Yeah, I just asked her if she could chill it for a bit but she's all, "you can't tell me who I can date." - she probably hated the fact that you guys have girlfriends in every city you play. - What? - We know. Oh, and if you think I'm gonna have sex with you just because you're some big time nba basketball player, you're gonna be very disappointed. - Wow. I can't believe- - wilt chamberlain said that he had sex with over 20,000 women. - Well, I'm not wilt chamberlain. - Well, that's obvious. You're never gonna score more than 100 points a game. - Jeez (laughs). Okay, you may know your basketball history, but you don't know me. - Oh really? What don't I know? - I'm bahai. - And that means? - It was in my "sports illustrated" issue. - (laughs) people actually read the articles in those magazines? - Funny. Bahai is my religion and we're celibate until we get married. - Wow. That is embarrassing. - It's okay. - No, it's not. I was just teasing you and I shouldn't have. - Let's forget about it. Start over? - Please. - Okay. I'm going first. So audrey, if you think I'm gonna sleep with you just because you're some big time nba cheerleader, you are going to be very mistaken. - Oh, I wish I was some big time nba cheerleader. - You will be. And even then I still won't sleep with you. (audrey laughs) (walter laughs) (gentle music) (crickets chirping) - now you have my number. - Yes, I do. - You won't call me. Thanks for the ride. (gentle music) (crickets chirping) and if I make the team, I'll have to quit my job at the restaurant. - Honey, you never told me this. Why do you have to quit your job? - Because I wouldn't have time. I mean, our season goes from September to June. We have practices, 41 home games a year and we do a lot of charity events. - And they only pay you $100 a game? 40 games. So that's what, 4,000 a year? - We do other things that make more money like, like shopping mall openings, conventions, charity events. What? What's that look for? - These players make millions every year and they pay you cheerleaders gas money, and you can't even afford a car. - Yeah, but it's a start. As a renegade girl you meet a lot of important people and companies. It's a good opportunity. - It's just, you were an a student. - And now I'm sure you're gonna tell me that I should've gone to law school. - You should've gone to law school. - Mom, can we not do this right now? I had a really long day. - Tell me about it. I just worked a double shift. - Point taken. - You know I love you and I'm glad you moved back home. I missed you when you lived in the dorms. (audrey sighs) - and I also got a ride home from walter james. - Walter, who? - Mom, he's the star of the renegades and one of the best players in the league. - [jessica] okay, and? - And he's really cute. - Is he nice? - Very. - Rich? - Millionaire. - Perfect. Sounds like marriage material to me. - (gasps) oh, okay. So being a trophy wife is okay, but being a dancer for a living is not. - $4,000 a year is not a living. Look, I want you to be happy. I'm here for you. - Thanks, mom. Love you. - Love you, too. (pensive music) (crickets chirping) - archie, mommy's home. Hi, baby. (archie whimpering) (pensive music) (fist knocking) (eerie music) right on time. So, have you got it? Good. Let's just take care of this super quick. (dramatic music) (bailey choking) (bailey thuds) (pensive music) (archie whimpering) (door clicks) (phone ringing) - hey, tracy. - Hey. Did they call you? - No, not yet. - Well, they called me. I didn't make it. - Oh, tracy, I'm sorry. - Everybody is gonna laugh at me. - No they won't. - I know it sounds pathetic to feel this way but I do. - Just, I'm tired of bein' this desperate actress just tryin' to get a break. Hopin' to get noticed just by bein' on this stupid team. (phone beeps) - hey tracy, I'm getting a call. Let me get rid of them. - No, don't. It's them. Answer it, they're callin' everybody. - Okay, hold on a sec. This is audrey. - Audrey, it's cassie, renegade girls. How you doin' today? - Hey cassie, I'm fine. - I'm calling to talk to you about your audition. Round four, public speaking, you didn't do so well. - I know. - Yeah, you really need to polish that up. But when it comes to dancing, we can really tell you love it and it really shows in your work. - Wow, thank you. I do. - We think you have what it takes to be a renegade girl. We'd like to offer you a spot on the team. - What? Wait, really? - Yes, really. But audrey, you have to be 100% committed. Do you understand? - Yes, yes, of course. I am 100% committed. It's such a dream to be on the team. I'm so honored. Thank you so much. - Great. All right, check your email tomorrow and we'll see you at the gym on Saturday. - Okay, thank you. (audrey exhales) (gentle music) oh tracy, I'm sorry about that. - Was it them? - Yes (laughs). I made the team, I'm a renegade girl! - Congratulations, audrey. Really, really, I'm happy for you. - Thank you. Oh my god, I cannot believe it. It's such a dream and it's incredible and amazing and... (sighs) tracy, I'm so sorry, I feel awful. - No, don't, don't. I'm happy for you. You deserve it. Can we talk later, though? - Sure. But, tracy- - okay, okay, I'ma call you later. Bye. (line clicks) (gentle music) (audrey squeals) - I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in! (door bell rings) oh, oh! Hi. - Hey. I was in the neighborhood, thought I'd take a chance, see if you were here. - I'm here. - A little birdie told me you made the team? - Wow. Those birdies must be renegade fans. - So they called? - They did. - That's awesome. Well, this is cause for celebration. Come on, get dressed. (gentle music) (birds chirping) (glasses clinking) (gentle music) (shutter clicks) (geese squawking) (gentle music) - oh, that was a fun day. Thank you for celebrating with me. - I couldn't have you celebrate alone. (audrey laughs) - that would've been very sad. And besides making the team, I guess you're pretty decent to hang out with, too. - Oh, I'm decent? Okay. No one's ever called me decent before. - Actually, you are. - Yeah? - Very much so. So, if you were to kiss me right now would that violate your religion? - Oh, absolutely. I mean, there's the petition I have to get from the church, two day waiting period, a sacrifice. - I couldn't wait (chuckles). - I'm glad. (gentle music) (dancers chattering) - hey, girl. - Tracy (laughs)? - Audrey, oh my gosh, hey! - What in the world? What are you doin' here? - Well, they called me about an hour ago and told me that I made the team! - Oh my god! (tracy screams) that's amazing. What made them change their mind? - Girl, I don't know but you think I'm gonna ask? - No. - And you don't ask either. - Okay! (tracy squeals) (audrey squeals) - okay, let's go. (upbeat music) (camera shutter clicking) - [cassie] there we go, please stand up. - Okay, tracy. There we go. Oh, nice smile, beautiful. All right. Now, a little bit of attitude on that one. Nice. Good. All right, audrey, nice smile. Beautiful, great. That's awesome. Okay, a little attitude, right? Good job. Okay, can you do a little flip and look back? Great. Nice. Okay, now nice. Very wholesome smile. There we go. All right, let's all move over here. Let's do a group photo. - [dancer] yes! - [photographer] okay, fantastic. - Woo! - All right, that was great. Okay, right into the lens. Nice big smile. Beautiful family. Here we go. Oh, great shot. Ladies, you nailed it. - Woo! - That's perfect. (dancers applauding) - okay, great, thank you. Thanks so much. Great work, ladies. Take a break and in five, just meet me in the bleachers. (dancers laughing) (dancers chattering) - I don't know, how you feel? - I felt good about it. - Yeah. - You were killin' your poses, so- - oh, thanks, girl. - Not bad for you. - Hey, what's up with coach cassie? She seems kinda bummed. - Are we really calling her coach cassie now? - [tracy] and where's bailey? - Maybe she didn't make the team after all. Oh! (tracy laughs) (audrey laughs) - oh my god, I'm so sorry. Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - I'm so sorry. - It's fine. - That's right, hilarious. (pensive music) you expect me to wipe that up, hm? Think you're so pretty you can walk around, make a big mess, then guys like me are supposed to clean up after you? - We didn't say anything. - I'll go get some water and paper towels from the bathroom. - You need ph neutral cleaning solution for hardwood. Water is the worst thing for basketball courts. - It's all right. Lou, I'll take care of it. - I'm sorry, mrs. Mcconnell. I just finished waxing the whole floor two days ago. - Lou, it's okay. - Sorry. - That's all right. - [audrey] oh, let me, I'm sorry. - Oh no, I've got it. It's fine. - Thank you. - And don't worry about lou. He comes off rough but he's really a sweet guy. - I'm audrey, by the way. - Nora. Nice to meet you. - Do you have work here? - Yeah, you can say that. - [dancer] mm hm. - [dancer] oh my god. (dancers chuckling) - [audrey] who was that? - Nora mcconnell. She's the executive director of the renegades. She's married to the owner. - Great, they should just cut me now (laughs). - [tatiana] yes. - How embarrassing. - Speak of the devil. - What? - Michael mcconnell, rich, handsome. - Hi. - I've been wantin' to meet him. - Girl, he's like ancient. - That is just fine. So come with me, I wanna get an autograph. - No, we can't go over there. - Come on! - No. - Come on, come on. Just don't tell nobody. - [audrey] (groans) tracy! - [tracy] hi, mr. Mcconnell. - Hi. - Can I have your autograph? - Sure. What's your name? - Tracy. - Tracy. Is there something that I can write on? - Yeah, thank you. - Well, that's perfect. - Michael? Michael? - Oh, right. - Thank you. Thank you, mr. Mcconnell. Mm hm. - [audrey] tracy! (birds chirping) - we have some very sad news today. The police informed us this morning that bailey west was found dead in her apartment last night. (dancers gasping) murdered. - I wonder if they know who did it. - I know it's a shock to us all. Bailey was such a beautiful young woman, and I remember how happy she was on the team last year. I... (dancers sobbing softly) - you may be contacted by the press. They'll probably want gossip about bailey's personal life. All we ask is that you please keep in mind that you represent this organization, and to have some respect for bailey's privacy. - Wow. Bailey would've loved all this attention. (solemn music) (dancers sobbing softly) - detective, I appreciate all your help. - [walter] I just can't believe this happened. - [audrey] this must be hard for you. - I did love her. - Sorry. - How could somebody do something like this? - It's gonna sound a little crazy. - What? - There's this girl on the dance team. Her name is- - hey boss? Some cops are here. They wanna talk to you. (water splashing) (solemn music) - mr. James, detective logan jameson, lapd. There's a few questions I need to ask if I may. - I wish you would've called first but no problem. - I'm assuming that you heard the news about miss west? - Yeah, I did. - Where were you last night between the hours of nine p.M. And midnight? - I was at the beach. - [detective jameson] doin' what? - He likes to go jogging on the sand at night. It helps out his calf muscles. - Please allow mr. James to answer the questions if you don't mind. - You're good. - Anybody go with you? - I was alone. I went around... - 9:15. You got back around 10:30. - We have witnesses that saw you arguing with miss west the night that she was killed. We believe that you were the last person to be seen with her. Additionally, we believe that the murder weapon belonged to you. (pensive music) - what? - Look, this brings me no pleasure and I mean, I'm a huge fan of yours, but I'm gonna need you to ride downtown with me. We'll have further questions at the station and we'll need to take some dna swabs. - No, you're makin' a big mistake. - George, it's fine. - I hope he's right. - Call my lawyers right away. - I will. - I'm sorry about this. - [detective jameson] sorry, we need to go. - I'm gonna get this cleared up, okay? Please give audrey a ride home. - Yeah. (pensive music) - [reporter] police have just arrested los angeles renegades star, walter james, in connection to the murder of his ex girlfriend and renegade cheerleader, bailey west. Lapd reports the cause of death was strangulation. Dna from james was found on bailey west as well as the renegade jersey that was used in the murder. Last season, walter james led the league in points in his- - I can't watch this anymore. - Oh my god. And you just had a date with him. That's frightening. - I can't believe everything they're saying right now. - They're saying it's steroids. - Mom. - How many times have we heard this story? Football players, baseball players, boxers. They get pumped up on these enhancement drugs. They argue with their girlfriends and the next thing you know, they're wheeling these girls into the emergency room. - (sighs) I'm not convinced he did it. - Honey, I know you have a crush on this guy. I'm sorry, but they found his dna. - I know, I'm aware. - You have no idea what kind of person he is. I'm sorry. It's just, I don't know what I would do if anything ever happened to you. - I know, mom. - I'm beat. I'm goin' to bed. Try not to stay up all night. I know you got a lot on your mind. I'm sorry. (solemn music) - five, six, seven, eight. One and two. Good. Okay, good, good, good, good. So when you do come up and you do the stomp and you're up like this, elbows out, hands wide. Got it? All right. Just do it one more time. Five, six, seven, eight. You go uh, uh. Good, let me see. Okay, that's enough. I like it, good job. Take 10. Okay. - Thank you. - Yeah. - See ya. Good job. - Thank you. - Good job, yeah. (pensive music) - [blonde dancer] I heard he beat up a guy in dallas. - [brunette dancer] didn't he choke his coach at practice? (pensive music) - he snapped because bailey had sex with another player. - [dancer] I heard he was jogging alone at night. Okay. - Pretty than alibi if you ask me. - I know right, it sounds suspicious. - [blonde dancer] I heard it was steroids. - I think it was a crime of passion. - [audrey] hey girl (sighs). - Hey. - Jeez, the gossip mill is in overdrive today. Everyone's acting so crazy. - Mm, I think everybody's just in shock, you know? - Maybe. (lock screen clicks) - I mean, you went on a date with him. So, did he seem like on murderer to you? - He's just a suspect, tracy. Innocent until proven guilty, remember? - Whatever you say. Be careful, girl (chuckles). - I mean, someone else coulda done it. For instance, you kinda benefited from this whole thing. - What does that mean? - Well, you don't make the team, bailey dies, spot opens up and suddenly you're on the team. - That's a really messed up thing to say, audrey. What the hell is wrong with you? - You're right, I'm sorry. - You should be. - Wait, tracy, wait. Look, I'm just saying I don't think walter did it. - So you accuse me? - No, but when I met you said that if be didn't make the team this year, you used swore to god, you were gonna kill somebody. You said that. - Really? It's called sarcasm, audrey, and I told you that in private. - I know I'm just giving you examples of what people think when you say things like that. I mean, you also said you were a desperate actress that would do anything to get a break. - You know what? Stop. Screw you, audrey. Actually, you're the one that's dating her ex boyfriend. Maybe you killed bailey. - Ladies. - I was with my mom when she was murdered. Where were you, tracy? - Where was I? - Yeah. - Ladies. - Where was I? - Where were you? - Knock it off. - Get out of my face! - Break it up! Tracy, get some air. Take her outside. Audrey, what'd you say to her? - I was at my acting class, okay? We did a scene from "streetcar" and I was terrible. Ask my teacher. She'll tell you all about it. You happy now? - My office, now. (pensive music) (phone beeps) - la renegades. (pensive music) - what the hell's the matter with you? - Coach, I'm sorry. - Have you lost your mind? You think that tracy killed bailey in order to get her spot on the team? - No, I just, I just said I don't think walter did it. - Well, great. You and millions of other nba fans don't think that walter did it. You know what I think? I think I don't give a crap! Do you know how many dancers I have on file that could take your place? - I'll apologize to her. - Damn right you will. (cassie sighs) (pensive music) listen, I don't wanna let you go. It's just if you pull something like this again, you're gone. You understand? - Yes. - Good. Now get back to work. - But coach, can ask you a question? - No. - Suppose he did do it. What reason would he have to kill bailey? - I can think of a lot of reasons to kill bailey west. Walter said he loved her, but he wouldn't have sex with her so she got bored. Then she started treating him like she treats everyone else, like dirt. And that's one reason right there. (pensive music) tell the girls I need a minute. (pensive music) - [tracy] and he's telling me it's all my fault, like really? And that's what I told him. - Tracy? - [tracy] see ya. - [audrey] I'm sorry. - Ugh. And then there were flowers at my door, so I don't know, we'll see. - Oh my god, how good do playoffs sound? - Ugh, I can not wait. - Patrice. (dancer laughs) - wait, don't you have a date tonight? - [tatiana] I do. (pensive music) (shower water splashing) - [bailey] what's the matter, coach? You worried that someday I'll have your job? - [cassie] I can think of a lot of reasons to kill bailey west. (cart rattling) (pensive music) (shower water splashing) - [jessica] I'm sorry, but they found his dna. - [detective jameson] we believe the murder weapon belonged to you. (pensive music) (shower water splashing) - [tracy] if I don't make the team this year, I'm gonna kill somebody. (faucet squeaks) (pensive music) (singer vocalizing) (audrey gasps) (dramatic music) - I'm sorry, I shouldn't be in here. - It's okay. You're one of the new girls, right? I remember you. Stay as long as you want. (audrey gasps) (dramatic music) (walter grunting) - hey boss, audrey's here. - Oh, don't let me stop you (chuckles). - No. It's good to see you. - You too. - I'm surprised you showed up. - Well, don't tell my mother I came by. (walter chuckles) (audrey chuckles) well, I guess if you're gonna be under house arrest, this is certainly the house to be at. - Legal team got me on bail pretty fast. - I heard you have the best lawyers in town helping you. - Best and most expensive. - I've been thinkin' about you a lot. - Yeah? - I mean the whole situation. The papers say that you were jacked up on steroids and freaked out. - I've never done steroids. None of that is true. Did you really choke out that coach? - That never happened. - Well, what about the guy you beat up in dallas? - That was some straight arm dealing with some drunk, angry fan. I didn't mean to knock him out. - Okay. But they found your dna. They said it was on the jersey. - That may have been my jersey. I don't, I don't know. I think I was set up or something, I don't know. - Set up? By who? I mean, walter, you said you loved bailey, that you never had sex with her and then she goes and has sex with a teammate. I mean, it must've really upset you. - Not enough to kill her. Are you done with all this? Because maybe you should leave. - Walter, wait, look, just hear me out. - I've heard enough. - I had to ask those questions, I just had to know. - To know what? That I'm not some cold blooded killer and that you're not next? (walter sighs) - I'm sorry, okay? I just need to know. And yes, that is why I came by. I'm on your side, walter. I never thought you did this. Okay? - Yeah. Thanks. - So, wait. There's lou, the creepy janitor, cassie, the crazy coach and tracy, the hot blooded cheerleader. This is beginning to sound like an episode of "dateline." - I know, but their motives are pretty thin. I mean, I know I just met walter, but I trust what he's saying. I know you don't believe me. - If that's what you feel, I believe you. I just don't think you should stick your nose in his business. It could get dangerous. And he's got lawyers and detectives that can help him get to the bottom of things. (audrey sighs) - maybe you're right. - And you can't let the team know that you suspect anyone. They could turn on you if they know you're on his side. - Yeah, but I don't think it's quite like that. - There's an expression. Guilt by association. - I did google lou and he did have an arrest record when he was younger. - Audrey, just be careful. How many times have I told you not to meddle? - [cassie] pop, pop, in sync. Come on, ladies. Yes, yes. That's it, that's what I'm talking about. I love the smiles. More of that. Good. That was late, maria. (upbeat music) feel it, big smiles all the way to the back of the bleachers. More. Eyes forward, feel that beat. (nora groans) hair whip. Pop, pop, pop. I love it, good job, yes! Shake it, shake it, shake it. Hair whip. Yes! Watch the girl next to you. Smiles for days. Smiles for days. Smooth. I love it, ladies. Great! Going again after a quick break. (pensive music) - [audrey] wow, so you've been on the team for three years? - Yeah, I just got lucky. - You know, I heard that coach cassie and bailey used to be friends last season. - They used to be. - Did anyone ever tell you what happened? - Audrey, meet me outside. (dancers chattering) what did I tell you? - To leave tracy alone. I tried to apologize to her. - You're bringing up bailey and the case again. It's distracting you from what I need you to focus on which is? Work. - Maybe you should cut her. - Excuse... - You heard me. It's not good for morale to keep talkin' about what happened. - The season starts in two weeks. I need all you girls upbeat and entertaining. How is that supposed to happen if you're constantly reminding them of bailey and walter? - Well, I'm not reminding anyone. It's all over the news. - Exactly, you don't have to. - You're the one dating walter, aren't you? - I mean, I wouldn't exactly call it dating. - You're emotionally invested, but don't let all this emotion ruin this for you. - Yeah, but do you really think that he did this? - Audrey, right? I hate seeing this, too. Walter was my friend. I met him when he was in college. - Well, guys, I think he's being framed. - That's enough. Do you understand? I need you to go out there and be a good little cheerleader. And if you have any more problems, I will cut you. - Yes, ma'am. Understood. - Good job. - Hi, I'm audrey and I'm from van nuys, california, well, the valley, and this is my first season as a renegade girl. - Wow, she's a hot one. If she wasn't so nosy (chuckles)... - My favorite childhood memory would be backyard barbecues with my family. My favorite fictional character is miss jane marple from the agatha christie novels, and my least favorite food is sushi because if you're gonna eat fish, it needs to be cooked (chuckles). And that's me. I'm audrey. (logo whooshing) (upbeat music) - hi, I'm tracy. I grew up in salt lake city, utah, and my favorite renegades moment is actually getting the call that I made the team. It took me three years to become a renegades girl, so I literally cannot stop crying. - Enjoy it while you can. - But I'm still very excited to be a part of this team and I can't wait to dance for the fans. And that's me. I'm tracy. - [sportscaster] it's an exciting new season for the los angeles renegades. As always, renegade girls will be available- - there's some dinner in the fridge. - [sportscaster] speaking engagements, endorsing- - yeah, thanks. - I'm headed out for the night. - [sportscaster] for charity events like the hope for a brighter future foundation. - See ya later. - Okay. - Have a good night. - [sportscaster] in addition to personal appearances, for charity events - goodnight. - [sportscaster] like the hope for a brighter future foundation. (buttons beeping) - tracy is not getting waited for any longer. Victoria, will you please take her space? Thank you. Thank you so much. Everybody in your formation. Great, music. (upbeat music) from the top. Let's take a slide routine. This is a slide choreography ladies, yeah. Your favorite, I know. Here we go. And push. And oh, yes. Watch the girl next to you. (upbeat music fades) (pensive music) good time, time, time. Yes! (pensive music) - no, you can't be here. - Find your space. Look to where you're going. Yeah, you're holding it! - No, you're not real. - [cassie] look like you're having the time of your life. - Are you okay? - Look like it! - This can't be. - [audrey] miss mcconnell? - Please, bailey, no. Bailey, no, please. No. - Miss mcconnell? - No! (audrey gasps) - are you all right? - Good, break it away. - I'm fine. - [cassie] show 'em you're working hard. - Why aren't you with the other girls? - Beautiful, turn. - I was in the bathroom. - [cassie] that was nice! Good job, maria. (pensive music) - I hate this. I hate this! - I thought you wanted to do something with your life aside from dinners and parties. - I am a front to your little indiscretions! What the hell is wrong with you? I'm not doin' it anymore. I'm not doin' it. - Calm down, nora, please. - Is this why you bought the team, huh? These women? They're all just your little prostitutes aren't they? - What the hell are you talking about? - You have been screwing bimbos left and right! Six years ago with that little filipino girl, jasmine. And then you, then you were banging mckayla and kiana and then what's her name? Raquel! (nora groans) I... - You haven't wanted to have sex with me for 15 years. - Oh (chuckles), so now it's my fault? - I'll tell you what. I'll take the blame, okay? You wanna divorce me? Go ahead. I didn't think so. - Oh! - I'll see you at home. (dramatic music) oh, hey bailey. - Oh, is this a bad time? - [michael] oh, no, no. We were just, just finishing up. Why you need to talk? - How long were you standing there? - I just showed up. I heard you guys shouting from down the hall. - Were you recording that? (pensive music) - you were. Why, you little, give me that phone! Bailey! Bailey, bring the phone back! (air whooshing) (nora panting) (pensive music) - yes, can I speak to detective jameson, please? - [officer] who's calling? - This is audrey anderson. He spoke to us about the bailey west murder, said if we had any new information to give him a call. - [officer] detective jameson is not in at the moment. - Okay. Can you just tell him to give me a call then? - [officer] yes, ma'am. - Thanks. (engine rumbling) (pensive music) - michael? Michael! (nora panting) (pensive music) - hi. What are you doin' home so early? - [nora] are you alone? - Yeah. - Oh my god, I'm sorry. I don't know what to, what to do. I can't deal with this anymore. - Okay, well, what's the matter? - The blackmailing, bailey, that stupid video. If the police find it, oh god, it could destroy us. - I know. Let's not do this right now, okay? - We could be implicated in murder! - Nora, calm down, please. - I don't want to calm down. Please, don't tell me to calm down. I need you to help me, damn it! You're the reason why we got into this situation. That new girl, audrey, she's been asking questions and I think she knows something. - [michael] all right. Let's go outside, we'll get some fresh air. It's gonna be fine. - [nora] no, I don't wanna go outside! It's not gonna be okay! - [michael] relax! - [nora] what is your problem! She heard me say bailey's name. Michael, I've been having episodes again. I'm having episodes. Did you hear me, michael? - Nora be quiet. - I think I need help. - You're fine, please. - I don't know what to do. - Just breathe. - It's happening again! - Calm down. - Let me go, michael! - Here. - Help me! (tracy groans) - stop. - Let go of me. (table clattering) (nora gasps) (tracy gasping) - oh my god. - Who is that? - I don't know, it's just the tv. - No it was not! Who's here? - Nora, wait, please, nora! (dramatic music) (tracy gasping) - oh. (tracy gasping) - I didn't expect you home this early. (nora exhales) - nora, he said the two of you were in a open relationship. - She heard. - No I didn't and even if I did, I swear I would not say anything, I promise. - .... - Look, maybe I should just go. I'm just gonna go. - No, no, no, hold it. Hold it, I just need, I just need to think. - Stay right where you are, do you hear me? - Just let me think for a second. - Look, I can call harry. We can put together a non-disclosure agreement. - No. Michael, we can't let her leave. - You'll be destroyed, you say one word about this tracy- - okay, I won't, I won't. - No, no lawyers! - Please, I'm sorry! - [nora] oh no you don't! Come here! - [tracy] no, wait! No, nora, stop, please! - Get away from the stairs! - Please! Help me! - Nora! - Nora, please! - Stop! - Nora, please! - Let go of her! - Please don't do this! - Nora, stop! - Please stop! No! - Tracy! (tracy thudding) (dramatic music) (pensive music) (crickets chirping) I can't believe this. I can't believe this! - This is what your cheating has created. - Shut up. (pensive music) (crickets chirping) (phone ringing) I need to figure out the right thing to do. - No. We need to figure out a way to cover our asses. (phone vibrating) (pensive music) - [tracy] hey, it's tracy. Leave a message. (voicemail beeps) - tracy, it's audrey. I'm sure you don't wanna hear from me right now, but I just wanted to say I'm sorry for what I said. I didn't mean to hurt your feelings or ruin our friendship. I was just upset about walter, but that's not really an excuse. Anyways, I just, I hope you understand. Okay, I'll see you at practice. (phone clicks) (pensive music) (nora sighs) - [greg] it looks like the los angeles renegades are gonna start the season without their point guard, walter james, which could cripple them mightily when they battle for the top spot in the western conference. And that's it for "sportswatch" this morning at 5:24 a.M. I'm greg karathanas. Now it's back to marc bakerman, "marc in the morning!" for today's headline news be sure to check in- (keys jingling) (gate clanging) (pensive music) (dramatic music) - lou discovered her body early this morning in the parking lot. The police found a suicide note in her things. Apparently she jumped. (solemn music) I know this is a shock. We have a grief counselor here, if anybody needs to talk and as always my door and nora's are open to you. (dancers sobbing softly) does anybody have anything they wanna say or any questions? - Yeah, how did she get to the rooftop? - They didn't say. - But she wasn't even at practice last night. - We just don't know. This is about as bad as it gets. It's horrible and I just hope we get through it. Bailey and tracy would want us to get through it. That's all for now. How was that? - [nora] (sighs) you did a good job. (phone ringing) - hello? - [nora] she asked a lot of questions. - Oh, hey detective jameson. - We should keep an eye on her. - Thank you so much for returning my phone call. Yeah, I think I have some information on bailey. - [michael] hey, lou. - Mr. Mcconnell. Hi, how can I help you? - You got a minute? - Mm hm. - Such a beautiful girl. You really cared for her. - I did. She was always so nice to me. Mean to everyone else but (sighs), so nice to me. - You were good to her. - I still can't believe that walter james would do such a thing. - I have a hard time imagining that myself. I need your help. - Anything. What is it? - I've got a problem with one of the girls. - What kind of problem? - A big problem. (pensive music) it's the kind of problem that you used to take care of back in jersey. - I don't know what you're talkin' about. - Yeah, you do. - That was a long time ago. I didn't do that. I don't know... - Have a seat. (pensive music) I've always been good to you, right? When your brother called, asked if I could help out, did it hesitate? - No. - Got you out of trouble. I gave you a job when nobody else would. I got ya clean, right? - Yeah, you gave me a fresh start. And you know, I'm grateful but- - have I ever asked you to do anything for me? (lou sighs) - no. - You do this for me, I'll get you more money than you could imagine. (lou sighs) you always wanted to go to mexico, right? - Sure did. - That's where you'll go. I'll get you on a plane, first class. Great vacation. They got beautiful women down there. Early retirement from all this. - Aw, .... She must be one hell of a problem. - She is. (pensive music) - who is it? - Oh, this is me. - [ride share driver] this is a cute house. All right, here you go, safe and sound. (phone ringing) - thank you. - [ride share driver] thanks, have a good one. - Hello? Yeah, who's this? - Nora mcconnell. - Oh, hey miss mcconnell. - Nora, please. Audrey, I know you were friends with tracy. - Well, yeah. - Well, we're putting together and decorating a memorial for her. You know, I really hate to ask, but I could really use your help. - Oh, sure. When do you need me? - Tonight? - Okay. Let me ask my mom if I can borrow the car. - That'd be great. - Sure thing, miss, nora. You can count on me. - Thanks, audrey. (pensive music) (pensive music) hello? Miss mcconnell? (pensive music) miss mcconnell? (pensive music) (door handle rattling) (door creaking) (door slams) (audrey gasps) (eerie music) is someone there? Hello? (audrey gasps) (eerie music) (audrey exhales) (pensive music) hello? Anyone in here? (pensive music) (door creaking) (eerie music) (shutter clicking) (pensive music) (dramatic music) (audrey gasping) you killed bailey. Tracy, too? - No, it's not right. (lou grunting) (audrey screams) (audrey choking) (dramatic music) I could never have done that to bailey. I loved her. (audrey gasping) (dramatic music) no! I'm sorry. I'm sorry! (audrey gasping) (heels clacking) (wrench thuds) (lou grunts) (audrey gasping) (wrench clattering) (pensive music) - are you okay? Yeah? (audrey gasping) - [paramedic] just some light bruising. You'll be fine. - Audrey, audrey! - Yeah, we're just glad she's okay. (police scanner chattering) - I'm michael mcconnell. This is my wife, nora. - Hi. - Thank you for saving her life. - Of course. I just can't believe lou would do anything like this. (gurney rattling) (pensive music) (police scanner chattering) - well, this case is startin' to look pretty cut and dry. - How so? - Well, we have to wait for a final report from the lab, but it seems that your janitor has been involved with multiple murders. - Oh, god. - Turns out that he had an extensive criminal record. There were no witnesses when he found tracy larson's body. We found more than a dozen photos of bailey west in some bizarre shrine. Now, he's clearly obsessed with her and tonight he tried to strangle miss anderson. Same mo as bailey. It appears that he tried to frame walter james, as he had access to his jersey with his dna on it. Audrey, you're lucky that miss mcconnell showed up when she did. - Thank you. - Of course. - Come on, let's get you out of here. (solemn music) (police scanner chattering) - I'm just so glad you're okay. (solemn music) (police scanner chattering) (alcohol splashing) (pensive music) the police are gone. Are you ready to go? - We just framed lou for bailey's murder, and I know he didn't do it. - What do you care? You're getting your star basketball player back. - I used lou to save you from tracy. - Save me? - Yes. Save you from a murder charge. You let her go. You deliberately killed her. Get away from the stairs! - Nora, please, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Please don't do this! - Nora, stop! - Please, I'm sorry! - Stop! - Help! (air whooshing) (pensive music) - yeah. So, it's your word against mine. - Really? - I wasn't the one sleeping with her, michael. - So you thought you should kill her? Let's talk about bailey. She's had you in a panic. (air whooshing) - did you send the video to anyone? - No. - What do you want? - $1,000,000 cash. - Oh (chuckles), honey, you're dreaming. - Dreaming? It's more like a nightmare, isn't it? The board of directors would force the mcconnell's out so fast. You and michael would lose big time and most likely he'll divorce your sorry ass, and you, you'd get nothing. - That's not true. - Oh, yes it is. When you guys got married, your prenup was all over the news. So yes, nora. If he dumps you, you get zip, diddly, nada. (bailey laughs) (pensive music) (air whooshing) - you've stopped taking your pills haven't you? - What does that matter? - Oh, I should've known this from the beginning. You've been manic, you've been having episodes. You're the one that killed bailey. (air whooshing) (pensive music) - bailey, I swear to god if you sent that video to anyone- - okay, stop. I don't want to talk about this anymore. So, have you got it? (pensive music) good. Let's just take care of this super quick, then you can get out of here. (eerie music) (bailey choking) (dramatic music) (bailey thuds) (dramatic music) - where is it, where is it? Where is it? (pensive music) (air whooshing) you should thank me for cleaning up your dirty work. - So, you got away with it? You didn't find that video though, did you? - No one's come forward with it yet. Now, thanks to lou, case is all closed up. - This is so wrong, nora. You have taken this way too far. - If it wasn't clear? (pensive music) you try to turn me in, I'll take you down with me. Come on, let's go home. (michael scoffs) (pensive music) - [reporter] sports fans around the world are celebrating this morning as walter james, the star point guard of the los angeles renegades has been cleared of all charges in the murder of bailey west. Police responded late last evening to a 911 call from the renegade facility. (horn honking) there, they discovered the body of another renegade facility employee. Police believe the eyewitness statements from those involved in the attack and other key evidence found at the scene... (gentle music) (audrey squeals) (walter laughs) (audrey sighs) - I mean, I realize I should be relieved and happy but... - But what? - It's just that lou, I think he was gonna let me go. - Why do you think that? - Well, right before I was about to pass out, he stopped. He released me. He couldn't do it. - What? Whoa. - And also, I don't think he killed bailey. He said he loved her. - So wait, you think the killer's still out there? - I do. - So, who, then? - I don't know, but I do think the mcconnell's are involved. (audrey knocking) (pensive music) (eerie music) (pensive music) (pills rattling) imipramine. (pensive music) "delusions, nora mcconnell." (air whooshing) (dancers chattering) - [dancer] let's talk about girl's night. (nora panting) - stop it, stop. Stop, stop. Stop it. (air whooshing) - that's it. (pensive music) - audrey. What are you doin' in here? - I was just grabbing something. (pensive music) okay, wait. Look at this. And did you know that nora is on medication? That she suffers from delusions? - You're up to it again. I warned you. - Lou stopped, cassie. He stopped choking me. He whispered in my ear, he said he was sorry. It was like, he couldn't go through with it. It was like he was being forced to kill me. - So, what are you saying? Nora had something to do with it? - I don't know, but lou loved bailey and you know that. - Yeah. Lou was a tough guy, but he was sensitive. He always was good to me. - Then how, why would lou take tracy to the rooftop just to throw her off? - I don't know. - Michael and nora are hiding something. - Yeah, maybe. Listen, those two have big time issues, and something's definitely not right, but I'm trying to protect a job here. Nora and michael, they're rich and powerful. What are we going to possibly do? - Maybe we could do what's right for tracy and bailey. I have an idea, but I'm gonna need your help. - [announcer] ladies and gentlemen, please take your seats. The press conference is now starting. (reporters chattering) - I hope you know what you're doin'. - Me too, mom. - It is such a great tragedy that has befallen our organization. The loss of bailey west and now tracy larson weighs very heavily on us all. Thankfully, the killer has been apprehended, as we try to heal and get this behind us. - Tracy loved to dance and because dance was such a big part of her life, we thought it'd be appropriate if her friends, our renegade girls show their love the best way they know how. (upbeat dance music) (dancers cheering) - [dancers] five, six, seven and eight! (upbeat dance music) (panting) (upbeat dance music) - this bothers you, doesn't it? Why nora? Why does it bother you? Look at them. (upbeat music) (eerie music) - hey, nora. - Bailey? Bailey's not here. You're not here (chuckles). Make them stop (throat clears). - No, you need to be here for your renegade girls. - What's wrong with her? - Mrs. Mcconnell, are you all right? - What did they do to you? (nora gasps) tell me. Why do you hate them, nora? (eerie music) - mrs. Mcconnell, why'd you do it? - You're not here, lou. You're not here. No. - I'm dead too, nora, because of you. - No. (air whooshing) - nora, nora! - Please, please let go of me! - Stop! - Please! - No! - Tracy! - You all betrayed me. You all betrayed me. - What did they do to you? Tell me, why do you hate them? - No. Because you're all a bunch of whores! All of you, you're all whores! Look at you! Ugh! All of you! She was screwing my husband! She was screwing him! - Oh my god! (reporters gasping) (pensive music) - she wanted his money. - [reporter] what's wrong with her? - She fell down the stairs. It was an accident (gasping). (bailey laughing) that's enough. That's enough, bailey. (bailey chuckling) stop it! Bailey, stop recording! Give me that cellphone. See, she was blackmailing me. I had no choice. I had no choice. I had to get rid of her. (reporters gasping) she's got it on video, see? You can see. Nope, it was lou, lou's fault. Lou did it. - [reporter] mrs. Mcconnell, are you all right? - [reporter] mrs. Mcconnell, is that confession? - It was not my idea to set you up. Nope. - [reporter] you killed bailey west. - [reporter] what are you saying, mrs. Mcconnell? Mrs. Mcconnell, are you confessing to murder? (reporters whispering) (pensive music) - bailey, stop recording! - Who's she talkin' to? - Stop it! I'm not gonna let you ruin me! (all screaming) (dramatic music) - stop it, nora! Nora, get off of her! (shutters clicking) (eerie music) - [reporter] mrs. Mcconnell, wait. What's going on? - Are you all right? - I got it all. - Yeah, I think everyone got it. - Hold on. - Nora, wait. - Nora, wait. - You need to stay there. - I can't believe it worked. - Mrs. Mcconnell? - Wait, what about tracy? - What about bailey? - I know, me too. - [reporter] a stunning and bizarre incident with nora mcconnell, wife of los angeles renegade team owner, michael mcconnell was captured earlier today. - Mrs. Mcconnell. - No! - [reporter] police say the videos reveal that ms. Mcconnell confessed to the deaths of two renegade girls. - [reporter] mrs. Mcconnell, what does this mean for the- - [reporter] this creates more trouble in an already turbulent season for the los angeles renegades. - Mrs. Mcconnell! (solemn music) - [reporter] breaking news. Police have now arrested los angeles renegade owner, michael mcconnell in connection with the cheerleader murders. The district attorney's office - you really nailed this. - [reporter] is expecting a full confession - not bad for a college dropout, huh? - [reporter] in exchange for a plea deal which would implicate his wife. The mcconnell's purchased the renegades 10 years ago, bringing four championships to los angeles. (siren wailing) (solemn music) (police scanner chattering) - [reporter] police throughout the southland are on the lookout tonight for nora mcconnell, who has been charged with a triple homicide. She was last seen Friday afternoon driving a gray mercedes. - Went around the house and locked all the windows. - I don't think I'll be able to sleep. - Well, try. (solemn music) goodnight, honey. - Night, mom. (solemn music) (audrey sighs) (police scanner chattering) (freddy yawns) (crickets chirping) (audrey sighing) (gentle music) (pensive music) (pom-poms rustling) (pensive music) (police scanner chattering) - oh, sh...! (pensive music) (police scanner chattering) - nora mcconnell, you're under arrest. Hands above your head. (gun cocking) (shot firing) (pensive music) - mom! (dramatic music) (shots firing) - [audrey] oh! (dramatic music) - stop! You proud of your daughter? - Mrs. Mcconnell, please, just put the gun down. - Oh, big aspirations, huh? She's runnin' around in short little shorts and has been sleeping with other women's men. Congratulations. You're one hell of a role model aren't you? - Don't do this. Audrey, go! Please! (shot firing) (audrey screams) - mom! Oh, no! (shot firing) (audrey screaming) (dramatic music) (shot firing) (audrey screams) (pensive music) - nora mcconnell, you're under arrest. Hands above your head. (eerie music) nora mcconnell, you're under arrest. Hands above your head. I said hands above your head! On your knees. (nora panting) (pensive music) - audrey. You're gonna be late. Season starts tomorrow. You should hurry up and get changed. Have you seen bailey or tracy? - No, I haven't. - No? Well, when you see them, will you tell them I'm sorry? Tell them I'm sorry. - [freddy] you have the right to remain silent. Everything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. - [audrey] okay, full disclosure. I clearly do not die in this story. I sorta lied. But hey, if I hadn't have done that, you probably wouldn't have watched, right? Don't worry, this isn't over yet. We need to put a ribbon on this. (crowd cheering) - [blonde reporter] walter james, you've been acquitted of all charges. It's opening night. How do you feel? - Never better. I mean, we got a great team. The guys have been workin' hard all summer. - I wanna introduce you, oh, there he is. - Excuse me. Excuse me guys, sorry. Thank you. - Wait. Walter, this is going out live. (audrey squeals) (gentle music) - hey, babe. Walter, this is my mother, jessica. - It was a pleasure to meet you, ma'am. - Hi. - Your daughter is amazing. - She is. - I am. (all laughing) - I don't know how I'm ever gonna thank you. - Get her a car. I'm tired of driving. - Mom! (walter laughs) - [man] hey, walter, come on. - I gotta go, see you after the game. - So, now that you managed to prove a man's innocence, have you given much thought to- - law school? - Yeah. What do you think? - Actually, I'm thinking about the police academy. - Police academy. You wanna be a cop? - Detective. - Hm. - Woo! - Are you ready? - You bet. - Woo! - Let's go. - [audrey] bye. (dancers laughing) - have fun, girls. - Woo! (upbeat dance music) - [announcer] ladies and gentlemen, how about a big round of applause for your los angeles renegade girls?
