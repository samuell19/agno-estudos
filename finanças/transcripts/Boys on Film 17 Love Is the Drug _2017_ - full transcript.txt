Stop it! Take it easy! Partying tonight? Yes, but it's been a while. See you around. One Gin & Tonic please. But hold the Gin. -So just tonic then? -Yes - Oh, I’m sorry! - Don’t worry about it. You didn’t spill? No... One Gin & Tonic May I sit down? Yeah, definitely. Sit. You should take your glasses off. You look better without them. Thank you. How do I look? Really good. - What’s your name? - Andrej. Hans. - Hello Hans. - Hello Andrej. Hi. Denice. Having fun? Been better, actually. OK? I recently separated from my husband. Wanna talk over there instead? Tell me if I'm too pushy… Don’t worry about it. We were together for 30 years Wow… that's a long time. Do you… are you alright now? I've never been in a relationship. Or nothing serious anyway. Why not? That's just how it is. I had a boyfriend before but… He cheated, so… You seem like a good person Hans. Or I get that feeling anyway. - Well, never mind. - Don't worry about it. Let’s just have fun! Cheers! So, what are you drinking? Andrej, we’re getting out of here. Already? But we just got here. Yeah, but this place is dead. Come on. Did I do something wrong? - You left me on the couch, alone. - You could have come with me. - And follow you like a puppy? - Yeah. Why couldn’t you just hang with me? - I don’t drag you wherever I go. - Yeah I noticed... Leaving already? - Yeah, well, they wanna leave. - Stay for a drink with me? You coming? Nah, I’ll stay for a bit. Let’s meet later Have a fucking amazing time then. Whatever. Thanks. So nice of you. Cheers. How long were you together? You and your ex-boyfriend? Oh, like a month. But he was never… I did fall in love. Anyway, it's never happening again. It's not worth it. Being single is much better. What do you mean? I can’t imagine living alone. Not all men are like him. - Hey, Henrik! - Hi! - How are you? - Great, how about you? - So nice to see you. - What are you doing here? I’m always here! Why are you sitting over here? - And you were all… - Did you see the look he gave you? Hey. Oh hey! Where have you been? I got a drink for you. Thanks. You want some? No? Have you tried it? I'm good. You're joking, Weren’t you young in the 70’s? Hey, it's you! Let's get a drink! Get your own fucking drink! So it’s him then? You're fucking him tonight? Why are you yelling? You fucking used me! I can’t deal with this. Go home, you’re drunk. Come on, let's go inside. Forgive me Let me go! Everything OK here? Yeah... Actually no, he’s being really rude. Alright, time to go home now. Come Andrej, let’s go. Tell me what you think, of my life, of my adolescence. Tell me what you think, I too long for love and violence. You didn't call yesterday, and… Are we going to the beach after all? Right. I'll be there at 10. You're still not sure. No, no. It's OK. No, I won't be upset. I'd love it if you came, though. Yes, the weather will be nice. OK, then. Sure, go. Yes, I'll keep an eye on the phone. Kisses. Tell me more... Where do you want to start? Feeling shy? Need some cheering up? That's it. Go for it. Pedro? Let's go to the beach. I want to be there at 10. What time is it? It's time we went. We're gonna be late. You're yet to shower? Help me out, it's all wrong. - Do you like it? - Whatever, mum... Pedro, have you seen my phone? I can't find the phone... I can't leave without my phone! Pedro! Over here. Pedro? Pedro! Are you listening? Yes. What is it? I think we got here too early. We should have come in the afternoon. I’d have preferred that. I wonder why we came this early... Good afternoon, may I trouble you for a cigarette please? Yes, of course! By the way… If you have a lighter... Thanks. - Thanks, good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Did you see the way he looked at me? I'm going for a piss. Did you manage to pee? I'm going for a swim. Want to join me? Come on! Don't make me go on my own… You go, I'm not feeling up to it. Come on. You didn't reply to my messages… you kept me waiting No, I didn't reply. Where do you want to start? Go for it KISS ME SOFTLY an Anthony Schatteman film One morning I couldn't find her any more She left, and my heart was so sore But, oh, what does it matter, as long as I'm having fun... Because true love, oh, that will come along Kiss me softly, on my mouth Kiss me, until the sun comes out Take me with you, the world round And kiss me softly on my mouth Everybody. Thank you, thank you. Thank you so much. Everybody, thank you. I can inform you that I'm presenting my first album on Saturday. And there are still some tickets left. I hope to see you there. You too, my dear José. Thank you. Come on, girls. Thank you. Bye. Bye. And, what did you think? It was OK. OK? I thought it was really good. The girls did a great job. - They did great. - Yes, with their big tits. Woah, calm down. Big tits... Aren't you interested in big tits? I think that was cool, man. The first characteristic, and you may take a note of that, is that courtly love is an impossible love. Why is it impossible? Mostly because it is often a forbidden love between people who suddenly fall in love with each other, but who actually aren't supposed to. For example you have the case where two people differ in age, an older man who falls in love with a younger lady, and that love is mutual... These are the kinds of love that are forbidden. They have different religions... Hey! Why didn't you wait for me? - Are you going home? - Yes. OK, five extra chances! Within those five chances, it has to be resolved. Count up those numbers, people. Which figures do you see in the example next to me... Hey, fellas. Everything OK? Yes, Mathias is going to help me with my homework, OK? Do you want something to drink, Mathias? - No, thank you. - No? Four chances. Don't get your leg pulled, don't let yourselves get fooled. Things are OK like this, aren't they? My dad wouldn't understand. He doesn't get it. Yes, so? Well, maybe it's better that he just doesn't know. Are you angry now, or what? No, of course not. - It's nice with the green. - Thanks. Oh, and this, that's special. - I'm going to bed. - Goodnight. - Don't stay up too late. - No, no... - Jasper? - Yes. Would you like it... if we spent a weekend in Paris, just the two of us? Yes, that seems nice. Just you and me? Yes, you and me, yes. That's fine. Goodnight. Goodnight. What's the result? I know you know. Tell me. What's your answer? - Hey, darling. - Good morning. - Little one, tonight's the night, man. - Yes, your big night. If you want, you can help me autographing my albums. No, no, I won't. No, no, forget it. No, I won't open it. Martine, turn off that damn TV. It's driving me mad. People, just count the numbers. - Jasper, shall we go into the city? - Yes, OK. Go to the shoe shop, so he won't wear those rags any more. What will people think of me? It's going to be in all the papers: Lukkie Luk hasn't got money to buy his son shoes. - Is everything OK? - Yes. - You sure? - Yes. - Then why aren't you talking? - I'm talking. Honey, you're talking, you're talking but you're not saying anything. - I hate that school. - I know. If it were up to me, you could change schools. But maybe he's right. I don't... I don't know. Never mind, it will be OK. Hey buddy, is there something you need to tell me? Are you being bullied at school? - You're not gay, are you? - No. Don't fucking tell me that's true, man. - What do you care anyhow? - Of course I care. Fifteen. What's wrong here? Make an effort and take a good look. You can do it. This is for 2500 euros. Take a good look at the sum next to me. This sucks. Fuck, I just want to go to sleep. Hey, faggot. You're here to support your daddy? One morning I couldn't find her any more She left, and my heart was so sore But, oh, what does it matter, as long as I'm having fun... Because true love, oh, that will come along Kiss me softly, on my mouth Kiss me, until the sun comes out Take me with you, the world round And kiss me softly on my mouth Luk... Luk... Luk, I won.
