THE AXE OF WANDSBEK HEAVEN HELL Get off that bike! Have to play right here? It's a long street. - I gave it to them! - They're terrified of you. - They don't play outside other shops. - Only here. It's probably Dr. Neumeier from the Board of Health. - Hello Frau Barfey. - Hello. So, is everything all right? Nice of you to visit Tom. Don't know what to say. I'm so worried about him. - Worried? - Yes, doctor. The new law to curb hereditary diseases. It was in the paper. People with bad genes will be sterilized. But Frau Barfey! He can't change my past. Slaving the whole day at the wash tub… Poverty's not a genetic disease. As long as I'm in office, Tom will be okay. Hello, Tom! Hello! Nice of you to visit. It's my job, but I like visiting you anyway. - I have something that will amaze you. - You don't say! Dr. Meibaum disappeared. His wife thinks his books are in danger. Heinrich Heine. Freud, Remarque, Feuchtwanger, Friedrich Wolf, Thomas Mann. Very impressive. I couldn't keep books like that. - Why? You're a party member. - Exactly. Karl Marx: Das Kapital. - You're out of your mind. - But it's in my flat. - You'll end up in jail. - Karl Marx? Let 'em come. - Any bigger ones? - Not in that style, Herr Trowe. But here's a really nice one. Will you never learn? Those are for party officials. They're very popular at the moment. I sold two of them last week. Life is tough then? I may have a new customer for you. Footh, the shipowner. Small company but very influential. Colonel in the SS. Just what we need! He entertains a lot. It might help if you offered to do his laundry. I know him. He's not an extremist. I'll write a letter of recommendation. Back to my place? I have to look after my old man. Bad mood or just bored, Annette? How could I be bored with my Footh around? Do you still love me then? If you stay so cute, forever. But I have to go to Father. He's still plagued by the four Reeperbahn convicts. They'll be thinking… he's a communist. Why? Father's only the prison warden. He can't help it that the men weren't… - You know… - But he is responsible. He must see it's in the court's interest. The whole city's interest. The Führer won't come to Hamburg until those men are executed. He's blamed for Hitler's absence. Father can't execute them himself. They know Dencke's sick. Dencke? Oh, I forgot, the executioner. Why is the shutter down? Can you see at all? People don't need to see me doing all your dirty work. - Albert? - What, Stine? That old axe is still here. Grandpa's axe. Really something, huh? Sheffield steel. Listen to this sound. Music. Money sounds better. Just sell the thing! We don't need it anyway. No way. I won't part with it. - How much did we take today? - Just under 25 marks. It was never less. - Maybe it's the heat. - Rubbish. Then I don't know. This can't go on. I know who's to blame. The new meat department in the Wandsbeker Chaussee store. - People love it. - It's no wonder. Refrigerators keep meat fresher, and it's cheaper. And what did the Führer offer the little guy? - An awful lot. - And now? - The sharks still eat the small fry. - But, Albert! It'll take time, of course. It's all a matter of money. We have to be competitive. You're right. Refrigerators, tiled walls. - Nice window displays. - Flowers. A pig's head in the window. Lemon in mouth, parsley on its ears. Box trees outside. - Where are you taking that? - To the Barfeys. - Tom likes my treats. - You wrapped it smartly. Well, Fietje! Back with them old boots? They don't like you marching so much. Fix the sole. We fall in at nine. I can't go in slippers. Don't trample so much. Tread gently, my boy, always gently. If we had always trodden softly, we wouldn't be in power now. His voice, his voice. It must fascinate everybody. I heard the Führer in Kassel in 1932 and nearly cried. - Have you seen his eyes, Herr Teetjen? - You bet. Have you ever seen such hidden fire? He's a genius. The eyes of a political visionary. Dr. Goebbels can speak too. - Heil Hitler! - Heil Hitler! Heil Hitler, Chief Secretary. - Albert! Come quick! - What's up? - I have an idea. - Let's hear it. Am I right? You used to get on okay with shipowner Footh? Get on okay? We were buddies in the Great War. We stuck together in the Baltic fiasco. Didn't you save his life? Well yes, maybe. We were ready for anything. We requisitioned pigs for the brass. - And Hans Peter Footh- - He's in your debt. Now look what I have. How did you get that? Dr. Neumeier recommended Frau Barfey for a job with Footh. It's too far away for Frau Barfey. So, I took the envelope. - And? - And what? Footh is an important man. He's rich and he can help you. I can write to him without her envelope. Maybe, but that doesn't mean he will read it. He knows Neumeier's handwriting. They're good friends, and he'll read personal mail. But it's like begging. It's nothing of the kind. I don't want to ask for alms. You saved his life. Don't forget that! Come on. Write the letter now! Well, if you say so. Go on, do it! How do you start? Dear Comrade-in-Arms Footh. What have you been up to? I don't need that, Doc. - It's no use anymore. - I'll decide that, Fräulein Prestow. Lene Prestow is no more. Pills won't change that. Don't talk to me about TB. But you can help me another way. I'd like a few minutes alone with you. Okay. Lene, who knows what will be, but if you need spiritual help… A guide to heaven? No, Doctor, I'd rather deal with God personally. Something's on your mind. You know how I come to be in here. - Perjury, wasn't it? - Right. That's what the files say. Lena Prestow - 18 months for perjury. Heil Hitler. District Attorney. Do you also know that there's not a word of truth in it? - I haven't seen the file. - You don't need to. It says two men in brown shirts swore on their mother's grave that they saw me on January 18, 1933 at six o'clock in the evening at Ferry 7. And where were you? That's the thing. In the Reeperbahn shootout. From start to finish. Stuck on Große Freiheit corner, between Merzenich and Friedel Timme. Friedel Timme? Yes, Friedel… Now there's a man. A real comrade. Above all nobody's fool. He saw that the SA only wanted to provoke us. Why do you say that? I saw it all. One of the SA men shot his leader in the stomach. Of course, it was blamed on us. The Reichstag fire was the same. The Nazis commit the crimes. People are led to believe it was us. But, Lene! Then a few bribed witnesses appear. They swear that Friedel Timme and his comrades were guilty. But it won't help them. The truth cannot be killed. Even if they murder four upstanding comrades. I didn't know. That's exactly the point. You're not told and won't be told. You cover your ears and shut your eyes. Don't talk too much. It's not good. Don't keep quiet, Doctor. That's no good either. I know Otto Merzenich. I know he's never pulled a trigger. Now they want to kill him. Bastards. Splendid figure, Herr Colonel! Really… A superb profile. Enter! Excuse me, but Senator Heldt is on the phone. Oh! Heldt. Oh yes… fine. Senator, Footh here. Yes, indeed. I quite agree. A non-Aryan company is anathema to German Shipowners Association. Yes. That's final? Good. Heil Hitler, Senator. - Will it work? - Looks good, my dear. The Senate seconds the Association. They want me to take the tankers under my wing. There's only Berlin now. Any mail? Not from Berlin. Bring the rest upstairs. I'll get rid of the tailor. So, we can go on. Sit down on the stool, dear. But only the important stuff. Shipbrokers, Lloyds' annual report… That's late in coming. Mrs. Reymer's obituary. We'd better send a wreath. - From the Health Board, Dr. Neumeier. - Maybe an invitation. Open it! Bit tight here. Shouldn't be. - Dear Comrade-in-Arms Footh. - "Comrade-in-Arms" can't be right. It's been a long time. I hope you're well, since I am not. My butcher shop is losing trade. Competition from bigger stores is probably to blame. Who's it from? Show me! Käthe Neumeier's return address. It's signed: Albert Teetjen, butcher. To business, Koldewey. Prisoner Prestow died yesterday. TB - a lost cause. I see. Prestow. Sad. A young girl. Sorry? Oh, I see. She was still young. In the Reeperbahn trial, wasn't she? Yes, I know. Tell me, Koldewey. Do you think we're right not to speak up sometimes? In the Reeperbahn case? It's possible… but I haven't seen the files. I have seen them. The whole case is a rather dark affair. But the verdict was objectively right? Objective, Doctor? The judges live in the Third Reich. You mean the verdict is untenable? I was once very closely involved with the socialist left. They included Friedel Timme. A decent, clever man. I liked him a lot. Innocent typesetter Friedel Timme sentenced to death in Reeperbahn trial. Right? He's not guilty. At least not of the murder. One could assume so. I assume so. Listen, Koldewey. Not everyone is as daring as Timme and his comrades. But we should at least dare to be consistent. To say yes, or say no. Not just say nothing. Can I look through the Reeperbahn file? Certainly. I'd like to hear your opinion on it. The Timme files, Reeperbahn trial. Yes, sir. Scharnhorst, Scarlet Fever, Slayer. Person who is ordered to inflict capital punishment. Germany has employed professional slayers since 1200, although amateur executions continued until the 16th century. Today, they are only appointed on a case-by-case basis by the courts. No special qualification is stipulated. Get me the District Attorney on the phone. But first Herr Teetjen. Tomorrow… at… 9 Stock Exchange, 10.15 Shed 86. At 12. Meet at 12 o'clock in Schuemann's Oyster Cellar. Remember eating whole pans of caviar? No bread at all, but up to our ears in caviar. That was… in the central sector. Schaulen, Lithuania. That was precarious. One Teuton every 200 kilometers. - Wish we'd had the SS then. - Our time will come. The Führer will see to that. He'll see them off. They're in for a shock. Oh yes, your letter. I wanted to speak to you about that. You know… A bottle of Cognac and two glasses. Right away, Herr Footh. It was right of you to come to me. After all, we are old comrades from the Great War. And you've bailed me out a few times. It's okay, we can manage. Cash is what it's all about. Breathing space, hm? My store is a little dated. Big stores have icemakers. Window decorators. - But ours… - Modernization's the answer. How did you get an envelope addressed by Käthe Neumeier? It was a recommendation for Barfey, but she didn't need it. Tell me, Teetjen. Do you still have guts? Come on. Out! Out! Schröter! - Here. - To the right! - Timme! - Here. To the right! On the double! Merzenich! Need a scented invitation? - Asshole. - Tired of living? Mengers! All others go down to the yard! Bind them and take them away. Are the Reds finally for it? No, not quite. Just moving to death row. - What's up now? - Am I Jesus? How should I know? Maybe Dencke's cured his gout and your lease on life is up. A nice change of pace for you. In the best interests of the city, and all of Germany. You know that? Yes, they're four rogues. Criminals. It needs redressing, with the full force of the law. Our Führer won't come here until it's cleared up, you know? No, why? They're locked up and powerless. But it soils the city's image. Between you and me. Hamburg breeds reactionaries. The brothers balk. The Führer loves this city, I know, so he wants it to be clean. He gets what he wants. Okay, you'll do it then? Me? Why do I have to do it? I don't get you. It's only like the war. Maybe, but I'm more worried for Stine's sake. People talking. Nobody would recognize you. First, nobody's around. Second… Well, just wear a black mask. Top hat, tails, mask. - I've got no tails. - Rent some. From Bornemeier Costumes. I rented a Maharaja outfit there. And the axe? No problem there, pal. I have an axe, an old heirloom. Sheffield steel. It's shaped like this… Seems perfect for this job. - It's a butcher's dream. - Two thousand… could come in handy. It's easy money. We sure could use it to get us out of the woods. Okay, but promise me one thing. You'll do a neat job. I have time to think it over, don't I? Come, Albert. Time to move on. Why are you weeping, Sweet maid of the garden. Stine! You're home late. Business is business. - You were a long time. - Well. Another bar, then another… Footh can drink like a fish. - You kept afloat too. - You know me. If it's business, I'll allow myself a little drop. So, out with it then. It's not that simple, any of it. Hold your horses. What's up? Will he help you? Two grand in cash. A loan? Would I take something on loan? I'm willing to take Footh's oysters. But not his money. So, you'll earn it? Hang on. What work is there at a shipping company? I mean for a butcher? - Listen, Stine. - What's going on? This is kind of confidential. Is it illegal? What we discussed is beyond reproach. In the interest of the Führer. Well in that case. And I'd appreciate it, Stine… if you'd just trust me in this case. You know, the conservative citizen of Hamburg is a born reactionary. Negroes? I've sailed to Africa 19 years, the Near East for four. I can't fault my winchmen. They're faithful as dogs. - Cheers! - Cheers! Karstensen. A missionary at heart. I don't know any Negroes. Maybe they are as loyal as the captain says. I could say the same of my Doberman. Very true. The Germanic race is born to lead. The world needs us to thrive. Ladies and Gentlemen. - It's a question of time. - Roast beef, please. Roast beef? Why? Oh, Herr Colonel Lintze. Just a matter of time, and our country's colors will fly, our swastika will wave from Cape Town to Rio, Frisco to Shanghai. God, who is this windbag? Kralle. He's aryanizing Samuel Stern Shipping. A VIP. The Third Reich's star is rising. Heads… I do it. Tails. Shit, two grand says I do it anyway. Important call in your study. Thanks. Left to me, it would go ahead. No need to worry then. Your influence should swing it. Other owners want to get their hands on Stern's Jewish tankers. Lately I heard, "If Kralle says 'yes', it's final." - Berlin goes along. - That's overdoing it. I have my connections. How does our Footh find the Reich Governor? He doesn't say. He should get in there. The seamen are certainly enjoying themselves. Our medical friend appears to have left us. Käthe starts early tomorrow. - Very sensible, Achim. - We ought to go too, Aga. Please don't leave on our account. The man just called. It's all sorted out. Excellent Footh. Congratulations! Good news for the Reich Governor. Down with the Führer's foes. Cheers! Five by six. 30 square meters. The flooring is okay. The wall tiles cost much more. We can use simple floor tiles. Wall tiles. You're right. How about a smaller deposit on the refrigerator. Who pays cash? The store will look great and we'll prosper. Repayment will be no problem. Good idea. Looking at the figures, 2000 isn't all that much. Of course it is. 2000 marks! 2000 marks is a fortune! We'll make sure it's enough. It's not much for that job. It must be torture for you at Footh's. Torture? I suppose you could put it that way. - What's up? - Hear that? - Time's up. - Who for? The Reeperbahn Four. Hey? Did you hear that? Heads are to roll. - Who then? - Timme and comrades. They're done for. Dear Lord, Thou art our shelter, who showeth mercy unto us. Return to us- Shut up! Stine. Stine, it's time to get up. I've been awake for ages. You get ready first. Will you buy me the suede shoes? - Why? - I mean with some of the 2000 marks. Sure, we'll keep 100 just for us. Should be enough. Won't you tell me what you do there? Think I know anyway. Oh yes? Footh has some meat supplies which he doesn't want inspecting. You conduct a secret slaughter. Be honest. No no, Albert is not a criminal. It's not my scene. No, I just thought. Because you're so secretive. You have a great figure. Can't deny that. Work groups as usual. 20 men on laundry, 12 in the yard. Three men to do some weeding. The rest work inside. Thanks. Anything else? Yes. Last night, a lot of telegraphing took place. - That's nothing new. - Obviously. But the messages said that the Reeperbahn men are to be executed. I wanted to ask you, if that is the case. Well, it's not definite yet. I was informed that an amateur executioner will cover for Dencke. Come in. - Ah, Doctor Neumeier. - Dear Koldewey! The Reeperbahn files. I had a good read. Take a seat. To put it mildly, a shocking case. - Above all the verdict. - Yes. We discussed it recently. I want to visit the men. As an official here, it should be okay. No, it shouldn't be a problem for you. What do you hope to achieve? Did they plea for clemency? Schröter did. Timme, Merzenich, and Mengers didn't. I would like to help them. - Why didn't they all make an appeal? - They chose not to. I don't know why. Timme was involved in the Soldiers' Council in 1918. - That won't count in his favor now. - Quite the contrary. But Colonel Lintze was his former commander. He's very influential. Maybe he could be of use? Teetjen, where are you? Lehmke? Oh, the bar. Are you alone? No, can anyone overhear? I have… bought a large quantity of beef. For two ships. It needs to be expertly cut, with an axe, you understand? Just a second. What's up? I'm going now. Bye. Still there? At the slaughterhouse. Hall 4. Every day from 11 o'clock. Is that clear? No, it's better like this. You won't be handling soup bones, you know. Albert, what are you doing here? - You a slaughterer now? - You could say that. Wouldn't it be better, Mengers, to grab the lifeline offered by a clemency plea? If the Reich Governor didn't mess with the courts. Maybe. We Jews are accused of showing great understanding. Don't be mad if I see things differently. This execution will never happen. Foreign relations are tense. This regime would risk its own neck by allowing such excesses. Think about the Soviet Union. A power whose enormous dynamism is now being recognized. Solidarity among workers is not a hollow phrase. I believe in our case, Germany stands at a crossroads. But that good will overcome evil. I want to believe in justice. Are you sure you won't appeal? I don't want your efforts to have been in vain. Anyway, I have to tell you that I am not afraid to die. Nemo ante mortem beatus. I had a lot of time to think. I made peace with myself. Don't raise your hopes, but the penal system has seen cases where last minute reprieves have been granted. At least you were sensible and submitted a plea for clemency. Goodbye, Schröter. The only one who's scared. The other three are hard men. Above all Merzenich. You might want me with you. He can be wild. I'll be all right. You can stay by the door. Okay, Doctor. Visitor for you. - What's going on? - Hello Merzenich. - Heil Hitler. - About time you woke up. - Shut it! - Watch it! Would you mind? What then? I'm the doctor for the women here. I know. Want to take my tonsils out? No need for your art, lady. All in good order, head included. But it does feel a little delicate. Herr Merzenich. I need to speak to you. Got news for me? Not really, but if you want a message passed on. Something at least. Who's in there? The women's quack. Dr. Neumeier, pepping him up. Is it true the time has come? No one knows for sure. A trusty picked up on it. Some amateur wants to practice on these guys. I thought it'd never happen. It seems I was wrong. It could even be next week. Who is the Third Reich? Those assholes who've occupied the police and army barracks? Juvenile delinquents. They shoot at honest workers. Do you think the entire nation will tolerate that for long? Hmm, they know exactly. They're already shaking. Look at that for example! That clown there. How long before he's in here? Merzenich. Don't make matters worse. See what I mean? An idle threat to a doomed man. "Don't make matters worse." They don't buy it themselves. Clear off and take that gun with you. Mr. Prison Guard. I asked you to wait outside. Listen to me, Herr Merzenich. You have strange ideas about what's going on out there. Many of the people who could help you or change things, are in the same boat as you. There aren't enough jails. But the best, most active are all taken care of. The facts will prove it. It won't take long. The red flag will fly on St. Michael's. As for a mercy plea, I won't submit one. I don't want mercy, but justice. I've been giving some thought to Lene Prestow's grave. I promise you I'll take care of it. Those flowers, I think they're called daisies. She used to like them. Man, he makes a clean job of it. Timme, a visitor for you. Dr Käthe Neumeier M.D. Who'd have thought it. There's really no danger here. Nice of you to come. How are you? Must be shocking to see an old friend driven to this. Take a seat. You haven't submitted a plea for clemency, Friedel. I would like you to do so. I intend to ask Colonel Lintze, to state your case to Berlin. Lintze? Don't know him. Is he really a colonel? I knew comrade Neumeier could go places. Always looking upwards. Don't bring that up. God forbid, Käthe. If you're worried about your red tainted past, my lips are sealed. So, Colonel Lintze is to be put on the case. He was commander of your regiment. He has pull in Berlin. The issue with the Soldiers' Council. You were a greenhorn. You fought at the front, were decorated. And that will lower the sentence? Well… I was decorated before I got the death sentence. Listen, Käthe. For many years I tried hard to teach you the ABC of political developments. Now you've forgotten it all. You're dreaming. You need another lesson. Step by step. Guns in the background. Reins held tight. German generals plotting revenge for 1914-18. All obstacles must be removed. The Reds, the pacifists. Even parts of the church. Presiding over all the private's brown shirts. The army was always a feudal organization. These men don't do the killing. They get others to do it. The SA, SS, Gestapo. While obstacles like me are cleared up, a mighty German war machine is gearing up in the Ruhrland. Then it's up and at 'em! Hurray! Käthe Neumeier, before the likes of you realize it thousands of bodies will again litter the barbed wire on the battlefields. Listen: The plea for clemency is futile. It would go straight to the trash can. If you really want to help, get me a file. A motorcycle filled up and ready north of the prison yard. The rest is up to me. Friedel… You can't expect me to do that. You really should come to church. Particularly at this time. How do you mean that? To thank God for all that money. God had little to do with it. I'll have to do it for you again. Well it's time you got up anyway. For today we hold just Germany, But tomorrow the whole wide world. We'll march until all shatters, With proud flags held unfurled. For today we hold just Germany, But tomorrow the whole wide world. We'll march until all shatters. But dear Käthe, what a strange idea! Moreover, a bit late. Not while they're alive. Due process takes time. If granted a reprieve, which I doubt, it wouldn't make the funeral. There must be another way. People's lives are at stake. I only go by the book. Please, dear Käthe. Timme, one of the Soldiers' Council. Have you no sense of patriotism? At the present time, as commander of a regiment, soon a division, I cannot risk my neck pleading for a condemned communist. Unworthy of sympathy. If it helps you, although there's not enough time, I'm going to contact Berlin. A man in the Ministry. - Are there no public executions? - Why ask? - Would you go to watch? - Don't be silly. Why not? Very pretty, Madam. Do you like them? They're super. You can pick them up tomorrow. It's inevitable, really. There's no space for real art in Hitler's Germany. If the masters don't like it, it's branded bolshy art and burnt. Nazis. How uncivilized! There's no chance of a last minute reprieve then? The deadline is the morning of the execution, right? The DA can still grant a reprieve and reduce the sentence to a prison term. I wonder what the final decision will be, if heads will roll or not. Dear Lintze, I didn't think you would go through with it. Well Aga, what do you think? Well since we're here now. As long as it is not a problem to sleep here? That's no problem, Frau Lintze. You must rise early. As an officer's wife I'm used to it. We'll retire now. Four o'clock is early even for us. - Is one blanket enough? - I think so. This way, please. - Will you wake us? - No, the maid will knock. You're sleeping here? Good night then. - Good night. - Good night. Yes? I was asked to wake you. It's five to four. Thank you. It's okay. I'm up already. - Frau Doctor! - Thank you. Siegfried Mengers. Executioner, carry out your duty! How stupid. Aga, got my cigars by any chance? Otto Merzenich. Executioner, carry out your duty! - Stop it! Stop it! - Soon be over. Criminals, against Führer and army. Be strong, stay strong. Friedrich Timme. You will meet a bloody end, but the future belongs to us! Executioner, carry out your duty. Aga, come away from there. It was stupid to watch it anyway. Now the Führer walks on to the podium. He greets a full complement of Reich ministers. His deputies. A quarter of ground beef. It's very fresh. Real party today, with the Führer here. - For you? - Two chops. The new shop looks great, Herr Teetjen. - Inheritance? - Not far off. Thirty-five. The daisies were Merzenich's last wish. Sometimes I think we'll never forget. - You really want to go to Italy. - I think it's best. Now it's over with Footh, I can't go on here. It's unforgivable how we just stood and watched it all happen. Why did we do it? Frau Lintze insisted. And I was hoping for a reprieve. Then Footh hired the executioner. How did he find this dreadful man? - With your help. - With my help? Yes, Footh explained it. He received a letter with your address on the envelope. - I addressed it to Footh? - Yes. Hang on! That could only be… I must find out at once. Will you come too? No, I want nothing more to do with it. You can't remember who you gave the envelope to? It's no problem. We gave it to Stine Teetjen. They wanted something from Footh. It was too far for Mom. - Much too far. - Teetjen the butcher? That's appalling! You couldn't see his eyes, but… somehow he looked familiar. So Teetjen the butcher was the executioner of the Reeperbahn Four. Teetjen? That's where the money came from. Was there no way to save them? A file, and a motorcycle. We're all to blame. To a greater or lesser extent. God forgive us. Unlikely he'll do that. God, I think I'm quite drunk already. Stine, I think money is a blessing. My late father beat into me, "You are what you own". You don't know how much he had to beat me. I was a slow learner. He was some guy. There should be more chips off his block. Sweet Stine. We're a pair, aren't we? - We made it. - Yes, Albert. Thank God. We made it. No more today. They should stick to the opening times. - Oh, Frau Barfey. - Evening. - Are you busy? - No. Tom says hello, and returns the harmonica. With many thanks. Eh? Doesn't he want to play anymore? Yes. No. It's just… He has a lot of work to do. He won't have the time. Come in! Have a drink with us. Hope it still works. Thanks anyhow, but I have to put Lehmke's wash in to soak. Well then. Good bye. Good bye. That's why on the Rhine It is so fine. On the Rhine So fine. You're a good girl, Stine. Cheers! But you have no idea how I got the money. If it's a criminal offense, go ahead, and confess? Criminal? Comrade Footh didn't ask me to commit crime. The opposite. The Führer's will. - I do what he tells me. - Authority must be obeyed. - Says in the Bible. - You and your Bible. My father's lesson was much simpler. Like this. Listen carefully. I stood in for the executioner. In the Reeperbahn case. That is what I did. - What? - Carried out the sentence. Sent four Reds to their deaths. Is that true? Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed. Says the Lord. But Stine. Little Stine. Better hope nobody finds out. Where does he live? 17 Wagnerstrasse, Wandsbek. Executing four men. What was he thinking of? His master's precept. Bang, and don't think about it. We'll smash his windows. Then what? You get the Gestapo on your back. Four decent comrades. It needs doing right. Everyone should know who the pig is. Patriotism should be publicized. - Heil Hitler! - So, off we go. Ugh! Not going there again. - Scary. - They won't hunt you. When our customers catch on, and know they supply us. - They'll stay away. - Think we're the only ones who know? Nobody knows that he wore the morning suit. I really don't care. I want it out of here. If I have to give it away. There's human blood on it. No cleaner can change that. Hey, Albert. Look at that. What did that woman want, Albert? I don't know. No business for weeks. How can that be? Think I know? Ask the people themselves. Do you think they know? Who cares if they know? I'd like them to accuse me of serving the nation! Yes, a national service. The SS recognize that. He looks like anyone else. This murderer. All should hear there's blood on his hands. He pockets 2000 marks, and helps give the Nazis free rein. To prepare for a new war. Revenge for 14-18. The death of our comrades. - It's a signal. - Yes. Continue their fight. Let people know. Warn them. Stine, it couldn't go on. We needed money. Then Footh had this idea. Albert, the axe is bad luck. - Get rid of it! - But Stine. Get rid of it. For my sake. Okay, I'll do it now. Put it in the trash. That was that. Albert, I'm scared. Scared? Of me? What will become of us? Two installments are due. Workmen want money. And no customers. Every day it gets worse. We'll get a loan. That won't help. Or should we hang ourselves? These brothers begrudge me my tankers. Stinkers to a man. Let them. Say I must have fiddled, to get hold of them. You did too. Everyone knows how. Oh, now you join the chorus. You forget the governor personally thanked me for my work. Without me, the Führer wouldn't have come. Enter! A Herr Teetjen for you, sir. A private matter. I won't hear of it. Speaking of the Devil. Tell Herr Teetjen, please, this is not a welfare office. I don't want to speak to him again. He's a nuisance. - 200 marks is no chicken feed. - I know. - But our radio could be collateral. - We have one. You have a mahogany bedroom suite. What? - My bed? - Yes. I also need bedding. If you have any left. We have six changes. But my bedroom suite and linen. Well, it's up to you, Frau Teetjen. As long as you pay me back. It's no great risk for you. But, as you wish. - I must have the money. - Well then. 50, 100, 150, 20, 40… 200. Now all you must do is sign that I get your bedroom suite and linen. - Six sets of bedding? - Yes. It's damask from my trousseau. There's damask and damask. So, sign here please. - Thank you, Frau Lehmke. - Any time. Look at her, pawning her stuff. But still wearing suede shoes. Beef 2.40, Liver sausage 0.20, Pork sausage 0.80. Well, how did it go? Footh wasn't there. They said I can go back. Thank God. I've sold quite a lot today. There was quite a rush on. Strange. Whenever I'm away business booms. Heil Hitler, Herr Schlittmann. - Here for your money? - You bet. Hang on! This must be… some kind of mistake. I think you're right. - Okay. - You'll definitely get it next week. I'd better. That was in the trash. A mistake, right? Look at that! What was I thinking of? I kept wondering, "Where did I put that axe?" Many thanks. Most men would do it for 2000 marks. If they had the guts. - And the skill. - Drop it, Albert. You did as the Führer asked. The war was bloodier. Bonehead garbage man. Dragging the evil axe back home. Get rid of it again. I know where to hide it. - Permanently. - Hope no one sees you. At half past midnight? It's gone. Thank God for that. Albert. Now the axe is gone, I think things will get better. - When was it? - Just before one. I wanted to meet you, but when I checked if the coast was clear, I saw him digging a hole. Hope you were careful. Hope nobody saw you with the axe. Karl. - Evening. - Evening. - What an hour! - Want the leaflets? Get some shuteye. Be ready in an hour. Listen, comrades. Something important. Friedel Timme's farewell letter. His mother gave it to us. It affects us all. All workers. "Dear Mother, Dear Comrades. "My last day draws to a close, "and it's time to say farewell. "Farewell to you, whom I love. "To life and my life's great struggle. "And to you, my comrades. "I leave, knowing that our ideology will triumph. "Even if we vanguards fall. "We wanted to spare people from the horror. "Do not weep at our graves. "Draw from them faith and strength to further our fair and just cause. "Fight for a better, brighter future. "Now do your duty. "Your Friedel." Oh my God! The axe. They're out to get me. The Reds, comrades of the four. "Dear Herr Teetjen, "If the three remaining installments are not…" Then come and get the bloody thing. There's nothing I can do. So, to the right. Lift! Oh, that looks just like someone is moving out. Running away? Make sure they don't take your bed and linen. - Two more beers. - Okay. - I'm going over to see. - Wait, Mom, I'm coming too. Really no need to worry, Herr Drilling. The eviction date is set. On the first he's out. And if he pays? I have three houses and 17 sets of tenants. I know when people can pay and can't. He can't, he's broke. It didn't last long. His blood money. This rabble. They want to get me. Alone they're cowards. They all come together. I'll beat their heads in. I can't handle this anymore. You? You can't handle this? Who do they want? It's me they want. Don't cry like that, my little Stine. It's all got to go tomorrow. - What's got to go? - Everything. The bedroom suite and linen. I pawned it all. Over at Lehmke's. We had to live! But Stine. On the assumption Footh would give you some money. Calm down, Stine. Together we'll manage to pull through. If it's not too late. Nonsense. And I'll throw the accursed axe in the harbor tonight. Hello, Albert. Haven't seen you for ages. Oh, it's you, Trowe. Had a few, I see. Your respiration precedes you, eh! Hey, they're after me. A damned bloodthirsty mob. - Who? - All the Reds. The whole Wagnerstrasse. No credit, no merchandise. Cooler gone, landlord kicking me out. Here, this is why they want my blood. What's in there? That? My grandfather's axe. Best Sheffield steel. I've got to throw it in the sea. You are really drunk. What's up with the axe? I used it to… Well… The Reeperbahn Four. The whole city knows. That's why they're after me. I have 70 pfennigs, and no inventory… Well I never! You wiped out the four brothers. Got a problem with that? Hell no, Albert, old pal. My squad was in that shootout with the Reds. Come to the bar. I'll see you right. Don't take it wrong, but they're selling bedding. I want to know what we can expect from you. We still have time. That may be. But we need to know. Come on, Mom. We have to get home. It's all there. Two, four, six pillow cases. Two, four, six sheets. - Two, four… - Seems to be in good condition. Frau Lehmke! What are you doing? The furniture looks half decent too. It's bit much, isn't it? Why? 200 marks are on the line here. Right! Get yourselves out of here! You vultures! - Get out! - Come quick, Mom. You bloodsucking leeches. In my own apartment! And the third? - And the third… - Go, on! He just looked at me. He was a madman. I didn't expect a fuss. Man must stand up for what he does. Maybe he thought I was scared. He doesn't know Albert Teetjen. Comrades, listen to me: Today the man is with us who fulfilled the Führer's request. He ended the Reeperbahn case by removing the heads from the Reds. That is a warning to all enemies. Opponents of the Führer will be crushed. Our comrade, Albert Teetjen's act served the Führer more than millions of idle citizens who proudly don the swastika today. The Reds are dogging him, so I now command, that this squad buy this axe. The axe used to clear a path for the Führer to come to Hamburg. To be auctioned off and bought by a member of this squad. Comrade Teetjen will receive the proceeds. This axe should be given a place of honor in the squad's bar. To conclude, a "Sieg Heil" to our Führer. Our beloved Führer! - Sieg! - Heil! Whoso sheddeth man's blood by man shall his blood be shed. Says the Lord. Man's blood. Shed. Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. They're in a blue funk. And I'm roaring drunk. Two hundred big ones. Stine's eyes will pop out. Stine! What's that? Stine! Stine! Everything will be okay. We'll sort it out. Everything will be okay. You're a sensible person. But never mind. You can rely upon Albert. You will meet a bloody end, but the future belongs to us. Copyright © 1999 TITELBILD, Berlin Suhtitler: Peter Chivers et al.
