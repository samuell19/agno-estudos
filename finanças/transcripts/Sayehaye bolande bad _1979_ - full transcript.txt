Not here. I must fetch some from the village. Let's put our shoulders into it. Once again. I don't think we can get it out this way. We can get to the village in no time. God bless you give me my baggage. I'll go and get a piece of wood. What? I said, I'll go and get some wood. Ayub. I am going to the spring. Blow the horn twice. I'll be back. Cheers. You did't come to the spring? What did you say? Nothing, just watch the road. Hello. Hello. Give me a cup of tea. The bus broke down again? No, the road is bad. Thanks Abdullah, you did a good job. What is wrong, Mash Taghi? You should see for yourself. One can see it from up here. It really looks like Abdullah. Look at his hat. I don't see it. There, below the castle. Yes I know, but what's Abdullah has done to it? You should look at it from close. With its hat and moustache, it looks just like a man. He's made big eyes for it too. Let me see, if I still can play. Pray that it doesn't come to your dreams tonight. Hello, sir. Hello, hope you are well. It's a long time since we got together for a drink. I have my adult classes, you know. You're right, we can still arrange it. I'll let you know. Let's have a drink tonight. I've told mother to fix some dinner, too. Seems to me you are fixed already. I've had a couple of swigs alone. But it's differen to be together. Not tonight. There's a sac of quince I want you to take to my brother. Send Ayub to get it. Yes, sir. Hello. Is your father in? No, he's gone to the fields. Teil him Abdullah fetched it. He can send for me if he needs me. No, it's heavy. I'll take it in. Hello. Come in and have some tea. I've had some. Don't you want anything else? I don't know. I shall ask my husband when he comes. Tell him to send for me if he needs me. Good bye. All right. Good bye. Hello. You are early. What did you say? You are early, I said. How come you're home so early? Is it a sin or something? Do you want me to send for Ayub? Ayub, why? Nothing. I just thought if you want I can send for Ayub. The headmaster and Taghi. You are all young. I'm tired. I can't be with Ayub and Taghi. And I saw the headmaster. He'll come here one of these nights. I'll go fix your dinner. Today Abdullah's mother asked me to go to the village master's house. To ask for Nargess' hand for Abdullah. It's time he got himself a wife. He is getting old, but he still acts like children. Today he had touched up the scarecrow. I couldn't see. But everybody says it looks awesome. From far away you'd think it was Abdullah. He is behaving like a child, not a man about to be married. Married? With whom? With Nargess. Today Soghra asked for Narges's hand for Abdullah. What did you say? Soghra has asked for Narges's hand for Abdullah. So the villagers will be busy for some time. Abdullah Khan. What's happened? Isn't Abdullah in? Hasn't he come home yet? He is asleep. Has somebody been run over by Ayub? God forbid, the village master wants him to go to the fields. What's happened? Come, I'll tell you on the way. Don't be frightened, Adbullah's bus is parked under the tree, I saw it. Then what is it? It's about Soghra. Whoever was responsible for this, may God cut him down. It's all Abdullah's fault. What's got to do with Abdullah? No, she's not coming round. Come, rub her shoulders. I was passing by. I saw her on the ground, kicking and convulsive. Her bundle over there. I fetched it. But I couldn't find her slippers. Something's is sure to have happened. Abdullah is a real trouble maker. Why Abdullah? Who else? He is the one who put a belt on it. Then he picked up a skull... God forgive us all. What's happened? What did Soghra say when you saw her? Nothing. She just lay flat there. Abdulluh, what was wrong with Soghra? I don't know. Why? She was talking to herself, but I couldn't make out what she was saying. I said "before you get home nothing'll be left of these." She said, "Whom should I take the fire wood to?" Her slippers were in the grave yard. Poor woman. Which way did she go? I didn't mean any harm. I know. But why? Where she is going, she needs no shoes. Put this between his teeth, sir. So that he does not choke. Why you, too? She is having a miscarriage. Speak up. What happened? Why did you barge in like that, specially when there ist a pregnant woman here? He seems to be frightened of something, sir. What could he be afraid of? He's been watering fields alone all his life. Abdullah, hold him up, let's take him out of people's house. Abdullah, why don't we go? There are no other passengers. Someone must do something. First Soghra, and now Taghi. God knows whose turn it'll be next. You do something. What can I do. I'm the master of the village. Not the master of people's fears. Akbar's wife has had a misscarriage. Don't speak, I'm frightened. Everyone's frightened. God knows whose turn it'll be next. Listen. Do you hear the sound? What sound? The sound of footsteps... The thumping of one foot. A dog howling. No, not that. There's sound of footsteps. There's no sound. Abdullah, do you hear me? The next day. Early morning. King Jamshid ordained... that people... of the village... should gather together. And he told them: I am your God. I have created you and I give you sustenance. You must all... prosterate yourselves before me. They all prosterated themselves before him. Who is it? It's me. The head master. What a surprise, come in. No, come out if you like and we shall take a walk. OK, I'll put on my pants. Well, how come you remembered me? I wanted to talk to someone. This is getting serious, I'm afraid. You know very well what I'm talking about. First Soghra, then Taghi. And today Safar's wife. Safar's wife? She too has had a fit? It's worse than that. I saw her from the window. First she poured water on her own head, then on the head of the scarecrow. As if she was cleansing it. These women are capable of everything. I suppose Safar... It's not a joke, Abdullah and you know it. Would you like a swig? No, my stomach is in bad shape. Come on, have some. One swig can't do anything to your stomach. I don't understand why you? No it's enough, for me it's finished. As for you, it's up to you, but if you ask me... So he's had an effect on you too, even you. I suppose he's forbidden this, too. What are you talking about? I'm thinking of Safar's wife... and Safar himself. And the rest of them, even children. With all this glass-clinking and pretention. We've got so far from them. No, you are thinking of him. For me he's just a scarecrow. That's all. The rest of them must understand by themselves. No, he's not, no more. Why not? What's it then? It's only a piece of wood. It was... at first. But not anymore. Do you see it? And it's not dark. You could always see it from here. Let's go down, a bit further. No, it's late. if we do something to it, it should be in daytime in front of all. Well, that's not a problem, I'll do it myself. It's not as simple as you think. There are so many trees. What of it? Well, that's why I said I'm thinking of Safar's wife. I'm thinking of the slavery of the woman. Or the man. Who will tie wish-bands to it. That thing is just a piece of wood. You'll see. Mohammad. What's it? Listen. I don't hear anything. Listen, man, listen. There is no sound. Do you want me to light the lamp? For God's sake, don't open. There is nothing, woman. Sleep. If there was any noise, Piri would have barked his head off. Listen. What's happened? They're knocking. What? They're knocking. Who is it? It's me. What is it, Ayub? Why do you wake people up? Nargess has disappeared. What do you mean? She's disappeared, gone. Let me get the lamp. I come presently. Piri. You've seen't with your own eyes. She's just ripe, Time to get married. Her breasts have swollen. As if she's just given birth. Not so. You have a daughter yourself. You shouldn't believe such things. Why so late? Do I need a guard at my age? I'm worried about Akhtar. She's grown up now. Come along, girl. Did you see her? Who? Kobra. So what? She is a miswife. Don't start again. You think I like gossipping. If you had seen her, with that pale face of hers would have believed it, too. Well, if there is nothing, why did Kobra hide? Stop it. You go in. I go for a walk. Mother, who killed Piri? What? I said, who killed Piri? Nobody killed Piri. Piri died. It's nothing. Why not. Women even cook their sacrificial broth beside it. There's nothing to be done anymore. I can still be kicked to the ground. Who dares to get near it. Let alone kick it. I do. What about the grave of Nargess' baby? You can see it from here in day time. There's no grave. This is all nonsense. Weil, if you are going to kick it, turn over the grave, too. I'll go, but it'll cost you. We must make a bet. How much? 100 toman each. We leave the money with Ayub. I accept. There's no shovel. We left it in the village. What? I saw it on the roof of the bus. Go fetch the shovel. Cheers. Even if you don't go, I for one believe in you. I know. Ayub, Ayub. I knew he was going to get himself into trouble. It was Safar's fault. Talking of Nargess... It's Abdullah. How many days? Three. You again waited till the disease became incurable, then sent for doctor. Do whatever you can, doctor. It's gangrene. His leg must be amputated. Otherwise, he will surely die. He does not agree with amputation. He is not in a position to decide. You must decide for him. We have made our decision. To the hospital, immediately. No, doctor. No amputation. I told you he'll die if we don't amputate. He does not want to have one leg like "it". Like what? Don't send for me again. The sea is jealous of the depth of the well from which you have drunk.
