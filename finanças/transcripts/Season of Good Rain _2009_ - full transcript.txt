It just got harder and harder to quit. You know... I really loved your writing. Thanks. So did you ever get my post card? Why didn't you write back? I must have written a thousand letters.

Thanks again. You know... you should really start writing again. If I do... you will be the first one to read it. You look sad. Is it because I'm leaving? Or because we couldn't finish our conversation. What conversation? The other night, you said if I prove it to you... You know... Anyway why did you lie to me? Well...
